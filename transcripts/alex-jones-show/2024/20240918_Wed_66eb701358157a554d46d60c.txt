[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.907]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.596]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:24.346]  Hollywood has revealed themselves as they truly are.
[00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:36.708]  Arrogant, misinformed, spoiled a**holes who would rather support a foreign power that is responsible for sending the United States over a cliff than support the efforts of their own republic.
[00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:39.489]  Archetypes of the devil and God are real.
[00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:45.250]  And then once you understand the archetypes are real, where the archetypes come from, well that's because there's something behind the archetype.
[00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.031]  And that the devil is real.
[00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:53.956]  The bad boy of entertainment is getting the key to the city from the bad boy of politics.
[00:00:54.036 --> 00:01:00.080]  I want to thank y'all for this honor and just recognizing me being from New York, giving me the key to the city.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.445]  Sean Combs led and participated in a racketeering conspiracy that used the business empire he controlled to carry out criminal activity.
[00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:17.101]  Including sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and the obstruction of justice.
[00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:28.688]  The Sean Combs aka P. Diddy Epstein-esque saga is as much of a developing monstrosity as it is the ultimate New World Order celebrity distraction.
[00:01:28.968 --> 00:01:31.910]  This is sort of unprecedented what's happening here.
[00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.155]  You wouldn't often expect a celebrity mogul such as P. Diddy to be the subject of such an investigation.
[00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:45.980]  In summary, according to a lawsuit filed by Chicago native and musical prodigy Rodney Jones, a.k.a.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.484]  Little Rod, Sean Combs hired Jones to produce songs on one of his albums.
[00:01:51.724 --> 00:02:07.342]  Jones was then led into a twisted, rigged music industry den of iniquity fueled by underage sex trafficking, homosexual grooming abuse, murder, RICO statute violations, and every variety of drugs known to mankind.
[00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:20.986]  Those implicated in the lawsuit include Combs' immediate family, music executives, top-tier Hollywood actors, and a slew of hyped-up crappy musicians that inhabit the hijacked Illuminati music industry.
[00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:31.109]  We're talking A-listers like Cuba Gooding Jr., Meek Mill, Young Miami, Stevie J, Usher, Chris Brown, and even Diddy's own son, Justin Combs.
[00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:40.992]  Mr. Jones has secured hundreds of hours of footage and audio recordings of Mr. Combs, his staff, and his guests engaging in serious illegal activity.
[00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:54.817]  The lawsuit reads, quote, Mr. Combs had hidden cameras in every room of his home, has recordings of several celebrities, artists, music label executives, and athletes engaging in illegal activities.
[00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:56.097]  We're good to go.
[00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:30.343]  For instance, quote, Defendant Coram, Combs' assistant, required all employees from the butler, the chef, to the housekeepers to walk around with a pouch or fanny pack filled with cocaine, GHB, ecstasy marijuana gummies, and tuqui.
[00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:33.986]  Which is a pink drug that is a combination of X and cocaine.
[00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:34.707]  End quote.
[00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.270]  The devil's gonna operate through all the possessed people he's got.
[00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.171]  It's a program.
[00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:45.358]  If you're exposing these satanic interdimensional forces, the special operations of this interdimensional alien invasion,
[00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.579]  That's how they come through.
[00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:47.900]  Just think of them as aliens.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.064]  And then you can sell all these people because that's what they are from their perspective.
[00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:54.185]  But they're demons.
[00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:55.366]  They're interdimensional creatures.
[00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.728]  People are going to laugh at that until one attacks them.
[00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.509]  See?
[00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.013]  And I know the Bible that as you approach Revelations, the gates of hell are going to be open.
[00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:07.768]  The interdimensional gate, and only a small number of Satan's operatives were here before.
[00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.472]  The gates will be thrown open, and we're gonna have these things literally running around the streets.
[00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:19.137]  Now you ask, why would these creatures attack people that were doing God's work but didn't have God's protection?
[00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:21.419]  You'd think that would make them wake up and accept Jesus.
[00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.320]  They can't help it.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.722]  If you're not protected, they want to destroy you.
[00:04:25.222 --> 00:04:26.383]  It's like a zombie wants brains.
[00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:27.524]  It's got to go after you.
[00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:28.105]  It's its mission.
[00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:29.726]  You're like, well, that's fantastical.
[00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:31.587]  Have you looked at the stars at night?
[00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:32.828]  Have you looked at the sun?
[00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:34.009]  Have you looked at the birds?
[00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:35.591]  Have you looked at the wind?
[00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:39.454]  Have you not felt the energy, the good and the bad?
[00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:40.775]  We're on a fan-
[00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:42.996]  You're gonna be fully taken over by it.
[00:04:58.104 --> 00:05:04.590]  So you've got doorways into your soul, and the only way you protect it is Jesus Christ and that defense shield.
[00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.273]  And it's something you already knew, so you're not being taught this by Alex Jones.
[00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:14.538]  You're simply having your amnesia removed so that you can remember how truly ancient you are.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.505]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:25.027]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:32.893]  47 days, 14 hours, 53 minutes, 31 seconds.
[00:05:33.953 --> 00:05:35.974]  The most important election in world history.
[00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:42.955]  But if you count the 76 days once President Trump is president-elect, the deep state will go into total overdrive to remove him or kill him.
[00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.436]  They've already promised us civil war conditions.
[00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:48.416]  It's 123 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, 7 seconds.
[00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:58.613]  It is Wednesday, September 18th, 2024.
[00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:05.834]  We are going in, through, and beyond.
[00:06:06.414 --> 00:06:12.816]  And only by putting on the armor of God can we be victorious.
[00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:16.756]  Who does the bell toll for?
[00:06:17.017 --> 00:06:18.497]  It tolls for thee!
[00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:29.281]  It was appointed by God that you live at this crossroads in history, when the future destiny of humanity is being decided.
[00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:37.147]  All our ancestors' work, all their battles, all the things they went through, is coming to a head right now.
[00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:39.689]  We are at a paramount position.
[00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.574]  And we are in the pole position to go to the next level if we follow God's directives.
[00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:47.436]  All right.
[00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:51.743]  We have a massive transmission lined up for you today.
[00:06:54.704 --> 00:07:05.408]  We have a report out of Long Island of multiple bombs, one in a blue barrel, another in a vehicle.
[00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:09.009]  When they approached the people, they reportedly fled and ran into the woods.
[00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:17.512]  The police that looked at it thought it was bombs, but then the bomb squad got there hours later
[00:07:19.218 --> 00:07:32.006]  As people were already arriving in Long Island at the big convention center, many, many, many, many hours before Trump was to arrive, the bomb threat to try to scare the Trump supporters away.
[00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.468]  Did somebody put dummy bombs in there?
[00:07:36.008 --> 00:07:37.949]  Did someone claim there were bombs there?
[00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.210]  We don't know.
[00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:41.291]  Were there bombs?
[00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.252]  We're being lied to.
[00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:46.775]  We were told for eight hours by AP, Reuters, Forbes, CNN,
[00:07:48.283 --> 00:07:58.828]  On July 13th of this year, 65 days ago, that Trump had just fallen down.
[00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:00.549]  There was an assassination attempt.
[00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:08.812]  And then up until a month and a half later, Google would not let you search Donald Trump assassination.
[00:08:08.852 --> 00:08:10.173]  It would give you other assassinations.
[00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:14.595]  You could not find anything on it because they didn't want it discussed or debated.
[00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:16.416]  That's information operation.
[00:08:17.594 --> 00:08:20.495]  Directed from on high in the intelligence agencies.
[00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:26.677]  You saw similar crap Sunday outside Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach at the golf club of Trump.
[00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:32.158]  Unannounced golf game, but the man is waiting in the woods, we now learn.
[00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.339]  We'd been told he'd run in the woods and run out, witnesses said.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.581]  But now we learn he was there for 12 hours lying in wait, no patrols.
[00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:43.578]  We're on the perimeter of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.482]  Number one thing you do is patrol the perimeter in a security situation.
[00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:52.285]  And we were told it was a gang shootout instantly.
[00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:55.847]  That Trump was fine, it wasn't directed at him, but soon that fell apart.
[00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.769]  Now the state is officially doing their own investigation.
[00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:04.553]  DeSantis said, we can't trust these corrupt federal agencies that have it out for Trump.
[00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:06.194]  And I think that's obviously true.
[00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:07.495]  So good on DeSantis.
[00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.217]  The old DeSantis has been back.
[00:09:09.677 --> 00:09:10.137]  We like it.
[00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:10.898]  I like DeSantis.
[00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.831]  I didn't like it when he got hooked up with the neocons, but it looks like he's on the straight and narrow again.
[00:09:18.072 --> 00:09:22.836]  Shall we see this latest situation in Long Island outside New York?
[00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:27.921]  And I don't think we'll ever know the truth about what happened.
[00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:30.683]  We don't know what I told you day one is true.
[00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:31.324]  It was obvious.
[00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.285]  Total stand down and
[00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:34.764]  Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.545]  Secret Service didn't shoot the shooter.
[00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:39.086]  Crooks, the police did.
[00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:43.347]  He was known for 90 minutes on the roof for 26.
[00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.208]  Running around with a gun on the roof for at least six minutes.
[00:09:47.908 --> 00:09:49.309]  Right in the eyeline of Trump.
[00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:54.170]  In the videos from behind Trump, you can see him crawling around through a camera.
[00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.471]  I mean, the naked eye is way better than that.
[00:09:57.591 --> 00:09:58.932]  This is insane.
[00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:02.851]  And then, of course, the Secret Service deputy head is now the head.
[00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:06.393]  It turned out, I said, watching testimony, I bet he was in command of the stand down.
[00:10:06.413 --> 00:10:07.394]  He said he didn't know anything about it.
[00:10:07.754 --> 00:10:10.255]  Turned out he lied to Congress and was the one ordering the stand down.
[00:10:11.116 --> 00:10:14.258]  And now you have a Senate report confirming all of this that came out over the weekend.
[00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:17.580]  This is mega massive information.
[00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:20.962]  They wouldn't be trying to kill Trump, and this is so important.
[00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:25.205]  I was glad to see Jack Posobiec tweet it last night, because I've been hammering this since July.
[00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:29.068]  The deep state wouldn't be trying to kill Trump.
[00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:46.183]  If they hadn't done the numbers and knew that even all their banked-in fraud can't stop something that's a landslide too big to rig, they wouldn't be trying to kill Trump so desperately if they thought he was going to lose.
[00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:49.225]  We have the numbers.
[00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:51.907]  He had a mega massive landslide in 2016.
[00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:54.949]  The fraud wasn't enough to overcome him.
[00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:56.610]  People thought Trump was invincible.
[00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.952]  The Q poison brainwashed people that he was invincible.
[00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:01.340]  Massive election fraud.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.922]  They stole it, barely, after the polls closed.
[00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:07.084]  The same formula in the battleground states.
[00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:10.627]  They're blocking the windows, kicking everybody out, and then getting to work.
[00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:13.189]  The truck's pulling in at 3 a.m., 2 a.m.
[00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:18.573]  And now the landslide is gonna be bigger than 2016.
[00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:19.814]  All the evidence shows it.
[00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:28.801]  Not just the real polls, not just Rasmussen, but I'm on the ground, and almost every liberal Democrat I've known is now a Trump supporter.
[00:11:31.038 --> 00:11:32.259]  His rallies are bigger than ever.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.661]  The system is panicking.
[00:11:35.202 --> 00:11:40.146]  Report claims explosive device found in car trying to enter Trump rally.
[00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.968]  They also found a barrel they thought had a bomb in it.
[00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:46.392]  Nassau County PD says false alarm after they first said it was a bomb.
[00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:50.216]  Police say reports of explosives found in the vehicle of Trump rally are false.
[00:11:50.896 --> 00:11:52.237]  Here's original reports out of
[00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.771]  The Daily Mail, AP, you name it.
[00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:58.375]  Cops find explosives in car near Trump rally in Long Island.
[00:11:59.236 --> 00:12:06.723]  Police reportedly found explosives in a car near former President Donald Trump's rally site on Long Island ahead of a speech Wednesday evening.
[00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:21.239]  If it is confirmed, it would be the latest shocking security breach and comes just three days after a would-be assassin arrested after stalking the former president with a rifle at his golf course in Palm Beach Golf Club.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.927]  Sources in Nassau County Police Department allegedly told journalist James Lino that the rally site perimeter was breached.
[00:12:29.923 --> 00:12:31.564]  With a blue barrel was recovered.
[00:12:31.964 --> 00:12:36.227]  In addition, during the canine sweep, they apparently found an explosive device in one of the vehicles.
[00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:39.209]  The sources allegedly said the driver ended up running into the woods.
[00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.111]  No one saw if he had anything on him.
[00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:43.132]  They just saw him take off running.
[00:12:43.172 --> 00:12:44.553]  A lot of cars are now parking.
[00:12:44.933 --> 00:12:51.298]  They're lining up on the Hempstead Turnpike, just parking on the grass, even over the Eisenhower Park.
[00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:52.559]  They're just parking over there.
[00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:53.900]  The source went on to tell
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.847]  Reporters, thousands of MAGA fans are expected to descend upon Long Island this afternoon at the 7 p.m.
[00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:03.229]  ET rally in Nassau Coliseum.
[00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.031]  And we showed you B-roll earlier.
[00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:11.037]  From two hours ago, already thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands massing.
[00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.821]  Suspicious occurrence near Donald Trump's New York rally.
[00:13:14.922 --> 00:13:15.562]  What we know.
[00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:16.083]  Newsweek.
[00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:24.585]  Breaking explosive devices discovered near Trump rally in New York after second Trump assassination attempt.
[00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.209]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:32.552]  He just held a rally last night with the governor of Arkansas.
[00:13:32.572 --> 00:13:34.713]  We've got some clips of that.
[00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.675]  So we'll table that for now.
[00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:42.040]  Ivan Reikland, really smart fellow from the Defense Intelligence Agency and former Greenberry colonel.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.241]  He's going to be joining us about the Democrats and what he believes they're planning.
[00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:50.663]  The intel we've got on the second Trump assassination and how we counter that coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:13:51.563 --> 00:14:03.727]  And then we will continue on with the transmission with Nathan Derriman, a very informative investigative journalist joining us to cover a host of issues.
[00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:08.389]  Royce White, the Republican Senate candidate in Minnesota.
[00:14:10.765 --> 00:14:14.447]  We'll be joining us as well and can't wait to talk to him.
[00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:20.590]  All right, let me now give you the big stories and we'll start plowing into them.
[00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:27.034]  This next stack that I'm just going to mention to go back to in a few minutes is just insane.
[00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:33.257]  Newsom has signed three anti-free speech bills yesterday.
[00:14:34.658 --> 00:14:38.340]  One of them says if prosecutors decide in their own opinion
[00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:54.651]  That you were trying to deceive with a deep fake, and they use examples of things that are clearly jokes, that you will face many years in prison after they've signed laws, that if you rape a child as young as 12, you get two days in county jail.
[00:14:56.632 --> 00:15:06.658]  So he arrogantly signed the bills with a hooping crowd of leftist and anti-free speech so-called journalists, Patrick Bateman 2.0,
[00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:28.201]  And they have openly said they're going to target Elon Musk and used examples of memes he put out that we'll be playing, where it is completely obvious that it is a joke to anyone who has an IQ above room temperature, which would be 75 degrees or 75 IQ points.
[00:15:29.142 --> 00:15:32.985]  But they have some impersonators that are so good you can't tell it's not Gavin Newsom.
[00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:37.708]  They want those guys, I guess, arrested as well.
[00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:42.973]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, anybody can tell when something is AI.
[00:15:43.673 --> 00:15:47.237]  It can instantly, if people are confused, they can find the actual clip.
[00:15:48.632 --> 00:15:51.334]  They just want another way to convince everybody to go after free speech.
[00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:54.396]  And that ties into Hillary saying, arrest people for disinformation.
[00:15:55.057 --> 00:16:05.925]  The UN and WHO have announced, along with the WEF, massive plans to start criminally charging people, which is already happening all over Europe and Australia, for their speech.
[00:16:06.005 --> 00:16:13.230]  And Canada, that is a huge vital stack as the system goes, openly, nakedly, communist Chinese style.
[00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.933]  I mean, this is, on a scale of censorship, it's very high.
[00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:17.694]  I mean, this is just,
[00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.171]  Wild!
[00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:26.497]  But, I mean, when you're smuggling 325,000 admitted missing kids into physical slave labor and sex slavery, I mean, why not?
[00:16:27.357 --> 00:16:31.221]  And Charlie Kirk did an amazing interview with a drug cartel family member.
[00:16:31.681 --> 00:16:36.105]  And this has all come out, by the way, in the documents, but it's an interesting interview, or interesting exchange.
[00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:43.511]  And pointed out that even the Mexican cartels don't like to supply children to the Democrats because they use it for sex slavery and more.
[00:16:44.735 --> 00:16:56.399]  This is what they do, so when you see a prominent Democrat on national television, there's a good chance they're a pedophile, or they're supplying children to people that are, then they put the pedophiles in charge.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.241]  Because they're so controllable, they don't even want money, they just want children.
[00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:13.846]  Remember what came out five years ago, and even AP reported it, New York Times even had to admit it, and type in, CIA recruited pedophiles in Afghanistan to be mayors and tribal leaders because they were so controllable,
[00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.872]  And would never turn against the CIA as long as they were supplied with young boys and girls.
[00:17:20.712 --> 00:17:21.953]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:23.974]  That's in the WikiLeaks first.
[00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:27.295]  That's what's going on.
[00:17:28.435 --> 00:17:40.180]  Just like going back 35 years ago and up until now in Germany, even before the Berlin Wall fell, in West Germany the CIA was supplying foster children to homosexual pedophiles and
[00:17:41.385 --> 00:17:45.147]  Regular pedophiles, all just as bad, to create a new culture.
[00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:47.909]  Don't believe me?
[00:17:47.929 --> 00:17:55.653]  Just type in 30,000 children placed with pedophiles in Germany, knowingly, to be raped, as young as two years old, to form a new culture.
[00:17:57.814 --> 00:18:01.576]  And then by the age of seven or eight, they would then supply them to government sex rings.
[00:18:03.837 --> 00:18:07.359]  You cannot make up this level of stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:08.584 --> 00:18:12.186]  Truth is so much more horrible than anything the mind can even begin to conjure.
[00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:15.748]  That's why they've got drag queen pedophile time and Black Rock funding.
[00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:21.511]  Men dressed like women in clown outfits, gyrating, half-naked in front of children everywhere.
[00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:26.254]  That's why you tune into the Olympics and you see it, because they are searing our conscience.
[00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:28.075]  That's coming up.
[00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:30.897]  Huge news on the economy as well.
[00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.853]  Also, you keep hearing the city manager in Springfield, Ohio says there's no evidence of cats and dogs being eaten.
[00:18:39.593 --> 00:18:46.056]  Well, he's actually now been interviewed and said, well, there actually are police reports and hundreds of reports coming in, and we are hearing this and seeing this.
[00:18:46.076 --> 00:18:48.137]  There are a lot of car wrecks and on and on and on.
[00:18:50.158 --> 00:18:57.001]  But the media then, you know, obviously Deep State calls in some bomb threats from overseas on themselves, even though it came out that they're hoax bomb threats.
[00:18:57.242 --> 00:18:57.882]  They don't care.
[00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:04.262]  And they just keep pushing the lie that everyone's being mean to the little sweet, precious baby cake.
[00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:09.924]  Haitians, even though I have new videos of more Haitians cooking animals in the U.S.
[00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:17.946]  Dogs, cats, and in Haiti, and their human flesh and kitty cat.
[00:19:21.547 --> 00:19:22.348]  Recipe books.
[00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.488]  I have a whole stack on that.
[00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.189]  And I have footage of Haitians eating people.
[00:19:29.249 --> 00:19:34.013]  I tweeted that out on, was it Friday night, on X, but I'll show it to you again.
[00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:41.118]  Please type into X, shock video or warning viewer discretion advised, Haitian cannibals.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.343]  And I'm going to show it, not to be macabre, but because people keep denying it.
[00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:50.587]  And saying it's not going on, so it's very, very important to show that.
[00:19:51.027 --> 00:19:57.891]  We've got a lot of poison shot news, more procedures reports that's causing turbo cancers, massive cardiovascular problems.
[00:19:58.551 --> 00:20:08.617]  But some good news, the House has passed a bill mandating that it has to be passed by the Senate, that the President can't sign us on to the global WHO pandemic agreement that takes over our bodies.
[00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:14.421]  And then, of course, on the big Russia front,
[00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:18.723]  There's a lot there that we'll be detailing before the hour ends.
[00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:26.327]  DoD plans Eastern Europe nuclear strike simulation to prepare for the potential collapse of the world's agricultural system.
[00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:28.348]  That's what the nuclear winter will cause.
[00:20:29.489 --> 00:20:31.069]  The dust has thrown up for many years.
[00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.110]  Also, we have video.
[00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.431]  They say Ukraine drones.
[00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:36.112]  Some are saying it's a storm shadow.
[00:20:36.872 --> 00:20:41.974]  Biden Greenland last week blows up a massive Russian ammo depot, escalating deadly conflict.
[00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:45.096]  That's all coming up.
[00:20:46.343 --> 00:20:51.947]  P. Diddy denied bail, Sean Combs to remain in custody until trial.
[00:20:52.007 --> 00:20:56.090]  Sex trafficking, racketeering, and other charges faces up to life in prison.
[00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:06.637]  He was convicted, definitely an Epstein governmental cutout, so they're rolling him up now to begin putting pressure on the record executives that are listed, and a bunch of them resigned last night.
[00:21:06.657 --> 00:21:12.120]  Some of the biggest in the world associated with Mr. Diddy.
[00:21:13.891 --> 00:21:17.374]  So we've got the Ukrainians trying to blow up nuclear reactors.
[00:21:17.574 --> 00:21:23.980]  We've got them blowing up ammo depots and the announcements, the storm shadows could start or may already be raining down in Russia.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.943]  Remember what Biden said, he's all for it.
[00:21:28.003 --> 00:21:28.984]  Just don't blame the U.S.
[00:21:29.044 --> 00:21:29.905]  Even though the U.S.
[00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:40.514]  builds the shell, the avionics, the brain of the missile, it's then shipped to Europe, owned by a British company who puts the explosives in it, that arms the weapon.
[00:21:41.906 --> 00:21:43.927]  Like having a rifle, the U.S.
[00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:51.131]  sells the rifle, and then they put the bullets in the magazines in Europe and point the gun.
[00:21:51.171 --> 00:22:00.636]  Well, this just so happens to be a heavy cruise missile that can then, again, shoot through a small window.
[00:22:00.696 --> 00:22:01.756]  That's how accurate it is.
[00:22:02.757 --> 00:22:10.141]  You point it down to a three-feet range, target a very
[00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:12.760]  Serious situation.
[00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:36.916]  So first, let's go ahead and get into the massive, unprecedented attack on free speech with the legislation signed by Gavin Newsom yesterday.
[00:22:37.477 --> 00:22:38.137]  I've read the bill.
[00:22:38.177 --> 00:22:38.858]  We've covered the bill.
[00:22:40.346 --> 00:22:41.007]  It's in the news.
[00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:41.647]  I've got the articles.
[00:22:41.687 --> 00:22:42.127]  I'll show them to you.
[00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:43.629]  It's called the Elon Musk bill.
[00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:44.869]  Not officially, but that's the name of it.
[00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.133]  Targeting Elon Musk because he will repost.
[00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:55.797]  Does anybody that makes these things or promotes them that they say are trying to deceive people?
[00:22:55.957 --> 00:23:04.503]  Well, even if you tried to deceive somebody, you've got to let people put that out, which obviously Musk is doing, because then the system will set the precedent to ban anything and everything.
[00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:08.266]  If something is libelous or defamatory, you have to sue them.
[00:23:09.192 --> 00:23:10.052]  And you have to prove it.
[00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:11.552]  Of course, now, in my cases, they didn't.
[00:23:11.572 --> 00:23:12.553]  They just found me guilty.
[00:23:12.813 --> 00:23:15.413]  The judges did, and they had a show trial on how guilty I was.
[00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:33.976]  So, this is all part and parcel of this, but after I cover the Newsom bill now, I want to come back from break and get into how it ties into the other announcements by the EU, the UN, the WHO, the World Economic Forum, Hillary Clinton, where they're openly saying, we're going to arrest you for your speech.
[00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:36.837]  Remember, they sent one fellow to prison
[00:23:37.688 --> 00:23:38.649]  I want to get him on sometime.
[00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:39.389]  I heard he wants to come on.
[00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:39.950]  What's his name?
[00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.051]  Who made the meme back in 2016.
[00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:45.713]  Took him years to put him in, to convict him.
[00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:50.857]  And he just simply put out a joke meme about Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:53.218]  And they said, oh.
[00:23:53.238 --> 00:23:55.980]  And there's the headline.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.383]  Elon Musk shares memes made by FSB.
[00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:02.390]  Propaganda machine.
[00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.311]  Oh, the Federal Security Bureau.
[00:24:04.351 --> 00:24:06.291]  You know, the Russians.
[00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:07.552]  Yes, he's a Russian.
[00:24:07.592 --> 00:24:09.953]  Yeah, so the Russians are behind everything, I heard.
[00:24:11.174 --> 00:24:13.175]  Why, they say the Russians tell me what to do.
[00:24:15.736 --> 00:24:18.977]  I get zero tell me what to do from the Russians.
[00:24:19.978 --> 00:24:22.959]  We have, out of 50-something crew members, were Russians.
[00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.080]  Moved here when she was a girl.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.561]  She's been in the U.S.
[00:24:26.681 --> 00:24:26.941]  Army.
[00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:28.602]  Airborne.
[00:24:29.918 --> 00:24:31.940]  A nice lady who does a great job and is very patriotic.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.601]  But I mean, there is one Russian around here.
[00:24:34.922 --> 00:24:36.003]  That's total proof.
[00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:38.005]  We've got a Russian in the woodpile.
[00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:40.207]  We're all doomed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.153]  And they're kicking Russians in Europe off Olympic teams in places like France and everywhere.
[00:24:48.173 --> 00:24:51.216]  It's just, it's just, it's crazy town.
[00:24:52.537 --> 00:24:53.978]  Absolute crazy town.
[00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.521]  The only person telling me what to say and do is Alex Jones.
[00:24:59.292 --> 00:25:02.095]  And I do pray to God to give me discernment, and God does give me discernment.
[00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:03.916]  But, you know, it's very insulting.
[00:25:04.677 --> 00:25:06.459]  We're into round three of this Russia crap.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:16.668]  And Russia's outward propaganda reach is very weak compared to Israel, China, the left, BlackRock, the corporate media.
[00:25:17.228 --> 00:25:19.691]  We used to talk about who's got the biggest reach here in America.
[00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:27.102]  BlackRock owns 86% of the world's resources.
[00:25:27.502 --> 00:25:29.564]  They're behind basically everything, so most propaganda you see.
[00:25:29.584 --> 00:25:34.289]  And then I would say the Pentagon and the globalists, the big corporations.
[00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:36.871]  Israel's very big and effective at their issues.
[00:25:38.252 --> 00:25:39.534]  The UK is very effective.
[00:25:39.854 --> 00:25:46.901]  And just the Russians are not even on the radar screen, but they're on the radar screen when it comes to war, though.
[00:25:47.932 --> 00:25:49.993]  And so we're going to go to break here in a minute and a half.
[00:25:50.013 --> 00:25:54.934]  I'm going to come back and get to the news and signing the bills in public, laughing about it.
[00:25:55.915 --> 00:25:57.595]  It's like a cat that ate the canary.
[00:25:57.615 --> 00:26:02.877]  And we're going to show you some of these memes that they are literally pointing out and saying, this is what's illegal now.
[00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:09.059]  And it's just preposterous, uh, that they're trying to claim that these things are memes.
[00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:11.520]  So, so, or these, these memes are deceptive.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.062]  I mean, so you stick Kamala's head on somebody and have her saying stupid stuff.
[00:26:18.134 --> 00:26:26.156]  And then they're going to selectively indict you and all the rest of it to scare people away from doing this because they know, and they talk about it on the stage.
[00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:29.577]  I played clips this week of Democrats going, last week, it's terrible.
[00:26:29.637 --> 00:26:31.177]  CNN's like, it's terrible.
[00:26:31.217 --> 00:26:35.278]  More people listen to just individual creators on X than all of our viewers.
[00:26:35.358 --> 00:26:35.818]  Yeah.
[00:26:38.419 --> 00:26:42.800]  Because it's funny, but all good humor is based in truth.
[00:26:45.321 --> 00:26:46.361]  So that's all coming up.
[00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:52.059]  And then the World War Three news and so much more today.
[00:26:53.741 --> 00:27:04.610]  Please remember that when you get excited about the broadcast and you share the links on your email, your text message, by word of mouth, you share the links on Facebook, Instagram, everywhere.
[00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.695]  The main catapult weapon systems project truth is X, real Alex Jones is the coordinates.
[00:27:11.758 --> 00:27:18.720]  Go there and take the live show feeds from this show at Real Alex Jones and Infowars and share it to everyone you know right now.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.260]  That is so powerful.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.341]  When you share it and say, hey, they're covering important issues right now.
[00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:26.761]  California just signed bills to ban free speech selectively.
[00:27:27.081 --> 00:27:28.522]  This is a threat to our republic.
[00:27:28.542 --> 00:27:29.742]  The 1A is so key.
[00:27:30.422 --> 00:27:34.003]  And then we just magnify it and tell those you share it to, tell them share it.
[00:27:34.023 --> 00:27:34.583]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:35.123 --> 00:27:38.805]  This bad boy is the number one seller at the alexxionstore.com.
[00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:41.906]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:42.946]  Folks love it.
[00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:43.546]  I love it.
[00:27:43.667 --> 00:27:51.190]  I love wearing this out in public and it also lets the globals to let us know we are standing up against them and we know who they serve and we know who we serve.
[00:27:51.350 --> 00:28:01.594]  The black rock globalist controlled left from academia to the media is obsessed with bullying you into silence because their ideas are illegal and unpopular.
[00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:03.735]  And if you simply speak up, it's game over.
[00:28:04.035 --> 00:28:07.797]  So stop thinking it's just Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Donald Trump's gonna save the world.
[00:28:08.057 --> 00:28:09.077]  It's all of us together.
[00:28:09.357 --> 00:28:12.018]  And wearing t-shirts in public that promote freedom is key.
[00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:13.679]  It doesn't just show our enemies who are awake.
[00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:17.341]  Other people see it and realize how popular freedom is.
[00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:19.602]  So ladies and gentlemen, it's a win-win.
[00:28:19.902 --> 00:28:28.966]  Get great shirts at thealexjonesstore.com, fund the operations, we fight the tyrants at point blank range, and meet like-minded people and spread the word in the third dimension.
[00:28:29.266 --> 00:28:32.027]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:33.588]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:41.752]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide in defiance of tyranny and the love of liberty.
[00:28:45.894 --> 00:28:46.714]  All right, now.
[00:28:48.956 --> 00:28:59.040]  I know most of the audience gets this, but I'm talking to myself when I do this because I've got to remember this every day and stay frosty and stay aware of how we're in unprecedented times of good and evil.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.781]  That's how the universe works.
[00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:03.962]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction to Newtonian physics.
[00:29:06.323 --> 00:29:08.824]  So, the saying is we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:29:08.864 --> 00:29:09.945]  I say that every day because we're not.
[00:29:11.405 --> 00:29:13.826]  We're not in the normal state of the country anymore.
[00:29:14.566 --> 00:29:16.107]  The corruption's grown out of control.
[00:29:16.207 --> 00:29:16.927]  It's out in the open.
[00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:17.948]  I can't even deny it anymore.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:29.925]  And they are doing things with election fraud, and open borders, and human smuggling, and devaluation of the currency, and wars, and cultural poisoning, and attacks on the family.
[00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:40.950]  That is open war against good, decent, healthy society, because a good, decent, healthy society is an immune system on the mass scale against tyranny and evil.
[00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:49.134]  And they've just got to get us used to all the crime and the homelessness and the increased prices and all that comes with it.
[00:29:51.235 --> 00:29:55.738]  But two assassination attempts of Trump, all these scares,
[00:29:57.168 --> 00:30:12.877]  And then you've got the EU, the WEF, and the UN, and the Democrats, and the Labour Party, and Australia everywhere just saying, Prime Minister's, President's come out saying, this guy made a meme about me today.
[00:30:12.897 --> 00:30:13.837]  He made fun of me.
[00:30:13.857 --> 00:30:14.718]  We're going to arrest him.
[00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:16.659]  A few months ago, that was the new Australian leader.
[00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:18.160]  I saw that meme today.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.801]  I can't really do an Australian accent.
[00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:21.782]  Crikey, I saw that meme today.
[00:30:23.206 --> 00:30:24.347]  And I'll tell you, you'll be arrested.
[00:30:24.847 --> 00:30:27.229]  In a few months ago, they're like, we're going to arrest Elon Musk.
[00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.351]  That's in England.
[00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:31.092]  That's in Brazil.
[00:30:31.232 --> 00:30:32.273]  That's in Europe.
[00:30:32.854 --> 00:30:33.454]  The EU.
[00:30:34.815 --> 00:30:38.398]  And then you've got Hillary saying, we've got to get NATO involved.
[00:30:38.438 --> 00:30:39.779]  We've got to arrest people.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.621]  We've got to get the UN involved.
[00:30:42.782 --> 00:30:48.266]  People that put out memes or say that we're lying about the shots working, which they're on record are lying.
[00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:50.408]  They have the worst record of lying ever.
[00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.480]  And you've got the W.H.O.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.102]  head, Tedros, and you've got his spokesperson, Hotez.
[00:30:58.202 --> 00:30:59.302]  I mean, I can play the clips.
[00:30:59.943 --> 00:31:00.943]  We need U.N.
[00:31:00.983 --> 00:31:01.343]  troops.
[00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:02.684]  We need NATO in America.
[00:31:02.724 --> 00:31:04.125]  We need to arrest people for their speech.
[00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:17.630]  And you've got the former head of Google, the head of Alphabet, super powerful, Eric Schmidt, a month ago at Stanford, who played the video here, saying we need to use NATO and the U.N.
[00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.792]  to censor and control, and we need to arrest people that speak out.
[00:31:22.208 --> 00:31:30.313]  So, you saw the clip yesterday of Hillary saying we need to start arresting people for disinfo and they decide what that is.
[00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:39.979]  So they're not just saying this, they're desperate, they're doing it because the truth is literally destroying these frauds.
[00:31:41.104 --> 00:31:57.448]  They had a meeting in January every year at Switzerland, the main World Economic Forum, and it was regaining trust and countering disinformation, meaning lie to the public more, fool them again, scare them again with a new pandemic, and arrest anybody that says we're horrible criminals.
[00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:03.030]  And you're like, well, they'll never get away with that in America.
[00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.371]  They've put what I know of tracking
[00:32:07.608 --> 00:32:11.672]  Thousands of people in jail for a few months, hundreds for over two years.
[00:32:12.672 --> 00:32:16.115]  The average sentence is a little over two years, 30 months, 25 months, you name it.
[00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:18.137]  I played the judges.
[00:32:19.138 --> 00:32:21.340]  I'm reading out your conviction now.
[00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:25.644]  It's a color of law system, no jury.
[00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:33.334]  They passed these hate laws and now it's... I'm going to read your Facebook post.
[00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:37.558]  You say the majority of rapes are being conducted by migrants.
[00:32:38.058 --> 00:32:40.300]  This is outrageous.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.481]  23 months in prison.
[00:32:43.002 --> 00:32:45.764]  And he's wearing the barrister wig.
[00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:47.625]  It's a clown show.
[00:32:47.646 --> 00:32:49.107]  It's like a Monty Python skit.
[00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:50.608]  But it's not funny.
[00:32:54.011 --> 00:32:56.412]  And people are like, I don't care about the UK, they're idiots over there.
[00:32:56.552 --> 00:32:58.292]  Who cares about Australia or Germany?
[00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:11.995]  The same global, corporate, black rock, UN, ESG system puts out the policies and then they're minions that they penetrate the cabinets with, as Klaus Schwab said.
[00:33:13.395 --> 00:33:17.156]  Now we control half of the government's cabinets, we penetrate the cabinets.
[00:33:17.536 --> 00:33:19.196]  Tudor is the best example.
[00:33:19.216 --> 00:33:20.737]  Would you like to see it again?
[00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:21.657]  I can play all this for you.
[00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.247]  Yeah, there's the judge.
[00:33:24.267 --> 00:33:25.888]  I played it like 20 times.
[00:33:26.229 --> 00:33:27.630]  You want to see it again?
[00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.771]  You want to see Klaus Schwab at the Kennedy Center?
[00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:33.034]  Literally saying all that?
[00:33:48.286 --> 00:33:50.048]  Ah yes, we can throw many of the governments.
[00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:51.590]  Half the cabinets we can throw now.
[00:33:51.851 --> 00:33:52.992]  We penetrate them.
[00:33:57.118 --> 00:34:00.422]  It will be quite easy to crush them and silence them.
[00:34:00.442 --> 00:34:06.109]  Can't really do a Klaus Schwab accent, but I can... I can do it on a strange level pretty good.
[00:34:07.344 --> 00:34:11.446]  Of course we'll have to choose the females for stimulating quality.
[00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:16.229]  After all, down the mineshaft there will be much time and little to do.
[00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:23.532]  Of course we'll have to pick from our military leaders to restart the population of the planet when we re-emerge.
[00:34:26.954 --> 00:34:29.956]  I have to say, Doctor, you have an astounding idea there.
[00:34:32.097 --> 00:34:34.138]  So, we can laugh about it.
[00:34:35.293 --> 00:34:37.974]  Or we can cry about it, or we can do something about it.
[00:34:38.395 --> 00:34:40.316]  And I guess we'll probably do all three, I know I do.
[00:34:43.177 --> 00:34:44.418]  So let's start getting into it.
[00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:46.279]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:53.443]  And to Elon Musk's credit, when this happened yesterday, he came out and said, screw you, I'm gonna keep doing it.
[00:34:56.444 --> 00:35:01.387]  But, again, you can put out a deepfake,
[00:35:02.898 --> 00:35:04.759]  And have Obama say whatever you want.
[00:35:04.799 --> 00:35:07.081]  But you don't need to have Obama or them say bad stuff.
[00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:08.022]  They say it themselves.
[00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:12.145]  And 99% of the deepfakes I see are jokes.
[00:35:14.387 --> 00:35:17.749]  And the ones that are fake that pop up here and there, we instantly see it.
[00:35:17.789 --> 00:35:19.410]  Everybody flags them and they don't go viral.
[00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:21.152]  People go, that's fake.
[00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:24.875]  So let's play Newsom.
[00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:26.976]  He hates parody so much.
[00:35:28.717 --> 00:35:30.459]  Let's play him arrogantly.
[00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:34.832]  Signing the bills yesterday.
[00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.394]  There are a lot of deepfakes out there.
[00:35:37.534 --> 00:35:38.554]  There's not a lot of disclosure.
[00:35:38.574 --> 00:35:39.615]  There's not a lot of labeling.
[00:35:40.155 --> 00:35:41.596]  So among the many A.I.
[00:35:41.636 --> 00:35:46.519]  bills that are on the desk are three specific election-related bills.
[00:35:46.779 --> 00:35:48.000]  Pulls them out and signs them.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:57.625]  I just thought, you know, why waste your time with a politician unless they're going to do something?
[00:36:00.985 --> 00:36:05.689]  They've got to remake American Psycho, not with Christian Bale, but with Gavin Newsom.
[00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:07.730]  I mean, he's more Patrick Bateman than Patrick Bateman.
[00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.451]  And he's murdering your freedom.
[00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:09.872]  Good lord.
[00:36:09.912 --> 00:36:10.052]  So.
[00:36:28.083 --> 00:36:34.188]  Let's go ahead and play one that they put in the news, that Newsom's even said, this is fake.
[00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:36.570]  Elon Musk retweeted this.
[00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.211]  We're coming after you.
[00:36:39.832 --> 00:36:43.775]  So this is a Kamala Harris campaign ad, and it even said when they released it, parody.
[00:36:44.676 --> 00:36:45.557]  That's not enough.
[00:36:46.277 --> 00:36:47.258]  We're going to indict you.
[00:36:47.278 --> 00:36:54.003]  We'll get a libtard grand jury, and we'll try you in front of a San Francisco jury, and you'll ask, go on, under the jail.
[00:36:54.043 --> 00:36:54.424]  Here it is.
[00:36:55.466 --> 00:37:01.962]  I, Kamala Harris, and your Democrat candidate for president, because Joe Biden finally exposed the senility of the debate.
[00:37:03.099 --> 00:37:05.881]  I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire.
[00:37:05.921 --> 00:37:07.742]  I'm both a woman and a person of color.
[00:37:08.362 --> 00:37:11.844]  So if you criticize anything I say, you're both sexist and racist.
[00:37:12.444 --> 00:37:18.988]  I may not know the first thing about running the country, but remember, that's a good thing if you're a deep state puppet.
[00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:24.931]  I had four years under the tutelage of the ultimate deep state puppet, a wonderful mentor, Joe Biden.
[00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:29.134]  Joe taught me rule number one, carefully hide your total incompetence.
[00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:33.936]  I take insignificant things and I discuss them as if they're significant.
[00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:40.118]  And I believe that exploring the significance of the insignificant is in itself significant.
[00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:42.559]  I'm talking about the significance of the passage of time.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:43.900]  Right?
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.781]  The significance of the passage of time.
[00:37:46.821 --> 00:37:54.204]  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time, and there is such great significance to the passage of time
[00:37:54.764 --> 00:37:56.286]  Another trick is trying to sound black.
[00:37:56.607 --> 00:38:02.736]  I pretend to celebrate Kwanzaa, and in my speeches I always do my best Barack Obama impression.
[00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:07.223]  So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's tight.
[00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:16.048]  And okay, look, maybe my work addressing the root causes of the border crisis were catastrophic, but my knowledge of international politics is truly shocking.
[00:38:16.108 --> 00:38:23.172]  The United States shares a very important relationship, which is an alliance with the Republic of North Korea.
[00:38:23.652 --> 00:38:25.894]  It is an alliance that is strong and enduring.
[00:38:26.234 --> 00:38:32.757]  And just remember, when voting this November, it is important to see what can be unburdened by what has been.
[00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:35.659]  And by what has been, I mean Joe Biden.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.621]  You think the country went to sh** over the past four years?
[00:38:41.482 --> 00:38:45.743]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:38:46.423 --> 00:38:57.728]  Alright, that is basically a perfect satire meme because a lot of it's real things she said and then the rest of it is just making fun of her real policies and what she really stands for.
[00:38:57.808 --> 00:39:01.289]  Now, no one's gonna watch that and believe she actually said that.
[00:39:01.789 --> 00:39:05.971]  But you have a right to put out something that
[00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:07.859]  Is deceptive.
[00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:09.220]  But what do the Democrats do all day?
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.741]  They lie their asses off.
[00:39:11.281 --> 00:39:13.121]  There's no Venezuelan gangs taking over apartments.
[00:39:13.482 --> 00:39:18.084]  There's no Haitians having car wrecks or killing anybody or doing anything in Springfield, Ohio.
[00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:23.586]  But you see, conservatives and populists, we know that.
[00:39:23.626 --> 00:39:25.226]  We don't try to put them in jail for that.
[00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.127]  We just show that they're a liar.
[00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:32.750]  Now, it's not just AI parodies.
[00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:36.071]  They're saying in this legislation
[00:39:37.295 --> 00:39:40.016]  There's three bills he signed that anything they say is deceptive.
[00:39:40.096 --> 00:39:40.957]  And let's put on screen.
[00:39:41.397 --> 00:39:43.958]  Who's the guy that got years in prison?
[00:39:45.619 --> 00:39:46.239]  What's his name again?
[00:39:48.321 --> 00:39:48.841]  Douglas Mackey.
[00:39:48.861 --> 00:39:50.021]  We put an article about Douglas Mackey up?
[00:39:51.182 --> 00:39:52.423]  I forget how many years in prison.
[00:39:52.463 --> 00:39:56.024]  He's still appealing it that he got for making a meme about Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:56.044 --> 00:39:56.605]  Here, I'll pull him up.
[00:39:56.645 --> 00:39:56.945]  There it is.
[00:39:57.385 --> 00:40:02.648]  The racist guy behind one of the most influential pro-Trump Twitter accounts was arrested for election interference.
[00:40:02.688 --> 00:40:02.808]  Yeah.
[00:40:04.113 --> 00:40:05.214]  And now he's been convicted.
[00:40:05.234 --> 00:40:05.954]  I want to get him on the show.
[00:40:05.974 --> 00:40:06.615]  I heard he wants to come on.
[00:40:06.635 --> 00:40:07.755]  Let's get him on, Daria.
[00:40:08.336 --> 00:40:08.636]  Scott.
[00:40:09.977 --> 00:40:13.919]  So, continuing on here, this is already happening.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.742]  This is already unfolding.
[00:40:20.343 --> 00:40:24.285]  And... It's dangerous.
[00:40:27.067 --> 00:40:32.410]  Ricky Von Twitter troll arrested for alleged election interference.
[00:40:35.382 --> 00:40:39.203]  Social media influencer Douglas Mackey sentenced after conviction for election interference 2016.
[00:40:39.343 --> 00:40:42.524]  Yeah, it took him many years to get it done.
[00:40:42.544 --> 00:40:44.005]  Like seven years, but they convicted him.
[00:40:48.766 --> 00:40:49.607]  It's just sick.
[00:40:50.507 --> 00:40:50.827]  All right.
[00:40:51.887 --> 00:40:52.608]  Now, continuing.
[00:40:53.828 --> 00:40:56.609]  This is just an individual that looks a lot like Evan Newsom.
[00:40:56.629 --> 00:40:57.209]  Very funny.
[00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:59.210]  Did a joke ad.
[00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.650]  Anybody can tell it's a joke ad.
[00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.091]  This is being singled out as bad.
[00:41:02.131 --> 00:41:02.651]  Now to the left.
[00:41:03.646 --> 00:41:04.626]  This is not AI.
[00:41:04.947 --> 00:41:07.047]  This is Gavin Newsom parody.
[00:41:07.087 --> 00:41:07.528]  Here it is.
[00:41:09.128 --> 00:41:12.390]  A message from the 40th governor of California.
[00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.230]  What's up, guys?
[00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.032]  It's your lovin' Gov'n, here to drop some nah about Prop 83.
[00:41:17.092 --> 00:41:26.836]  Prop 83 is a spending bill designed to make new investments in a freakin' butt-ton of underfunded sectors in our great state, like renewable energy.
[00:41:27.978 --> 00:41:30.822]  Cali leads the nation in solar power, which is rad.
[00:41:31.303 --> 00:41:32.464]  But what about lunar power?
[00:41:33.205 --> 00:41:37.711]  I believe the moon is capable of so much more than just controlling your Aunt Diane's ovulation cycle.
[00:41:37.931 --> 00:41:39.173]  Ooh, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:40.375]  Thank you!
[00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:42.557]  Let's put the moon to work for us.
[00:41:43.118 --> 00:41:46.339]  You know we crush it when it comes to whatever bra, drug laws.
[00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:48.480]  But Prop 83, it's different.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:54.281]  Allowing Californians to keep up to seven ounces of hallucinogenic toad venom for personal use.
[00:41:54.741 --> 00:42:00.763]  Plus, two gallons of synthetic peyote and rando Guatemalan lab s*** bought with crypto off the dark web.
[00:42:03.883 --> 00:42:05.144]  Awesome.
[00:42:05.164 --> 00:42:14.632]  83 also incentivizes the best and brightest in tech to live and work in Silicon Valley by making vaping in offices, hospitals, and Ferrari dealerships mandatory.
[00:42:15.092 --> 00:42:15.873]  Can I hit that?
[00:42:16.493 --> 00:42:16.774]  Sure.
[00:42:17.114 --> 00:42:18.195]  But I only vape Merlot.
[00:42:19.456 --> 00:42:19.816]  Mer-who?
[00:42:21.397 --> 00:42:23.799]  And with Prop 83, everybody gets a black friend.
[00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:26.001]  Like my man... Nate.
[00:42:26.641 --> 00:42:27.282]  Nate here.
[00:42:28.383 --> 00:42:31.766]  Nate and I love to hang out on the weekends and do the stuff that Nate loves to do.
[00:42:32.226 --> 00:42:33.107]  I like birdwatching.
[00:42:34.162 --> 00:42:34.722]  Whatever!
[00:42:34.742 --> 00:42:51.172]  Prop 83 gets binoculars for all, especially the blind, and earmarks $200 million to build a museum at Zac Efron's birthplace, so future generations can learn about the high school musical franchise, his nutritional regimen, and Zac's ab routine as well.
[00:42:52.452 --> 00:42:58.356]  And lost another black friend.
[00:42:58.376 --> 00:42:58.356]  $99?
[00:42:58.396 --> 00:43:02.118]  $100!
[00:42:58.456 --> 00:43:02.118]  Hey, brother, could I get a squirt of that good stuff?
[00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:08.555]  So do me a solid to ensure a bright future for all golden skaters.
[00:43:09.015 --> 00:43:10.536]  Vote yes on Prop 83.
[00:43:10.616 --> 00:43:12.517]  Hey, do you watch Birds?
[00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:19.920]  Paid for by the middle-aged woman rooting for Zac Efron's track.
[00:43:22.542 --> 00:43:23.882]  Now that's from Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:25.203]  But...
[00:43:26.482 --> 00:43:29.103]  That's something that they decided is deceiving.
[00:43:29.203 --> 00:43:29.923]  Well, jail time.
[00:43:30.203 --> 00:43:32.244]  Let's put that article you had up there back on screen, please.
[00:43:32.284 --> 00:43:32.744]  That was key.
[00:43:33.445 --> 00:43:40.107]  California Gavin Newsom just signed a bill that bans deep fake videos after this Kamala Harris parody video went viral.
[00:43:40.787 --> 00:43:42.248]  That's exactly what they're singling out.
[00:43:42.268 --> 00:43:43.208]  I have the articles right here.
[00:43:43.828 --> 00:43:44.569]  Elon Musk.
[00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.649]  Now, here is a five-minute video.
[00:43:46.669 --> 00:43:47.810]  I'm not going to air the whole thing.
[00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.551]  But this is what you can do with AI.
[00:43:52.332 --> 00:43:53.112]  Gavin Newsom
[00:43:54.457 --> 00:43:55.798]  Saying bad things about Kamala.
[00:43:56.018 --> 00:43:57.318]  Obviously, it's not real.
[00:43:57.438 --> 00:43:58.459]  Anybody can tell that.
[00:43:58.959 --> 00:44:02.760]  But again, even if whoever made it wanted to be deceptive, we have a right to see it.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:15.425]  And if we didn't have the Supreme Court, the Democrats had it, and if they're able to pack it, like they say, if Kamala steals the election, that means they add a whole bunch of new members that they all appoint, and go from 9 to, say, 23, they're talking about.
[00:44:16.698 --> 00:44:18.519]  They'll control the court for another 20, 30 years.
[00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.880]  And then they'll sew up the country under tyranny.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.301]  But the Supreme Court we have now will definitely overturn what California's done.
[00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:25.742]  They have to.
[00:44:25.762 --> 00:44:27.062]  I mean, it's outrageously illegal.
[00:44:27.723 --> 00:44:28.783]  Now, here's a real deepfake.
[00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:34.965]  I just know very few people refusing to vote for Kamala because she's a woman.
[00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:45.570]  The people I know who are refusing to vote for Kamala are refusing to do so because she was the border czar and catalyzed the invasion of our country by people who hate us and refuse to assemble it.
[00:44:46.857 --> 00:44:53.764]  They're not voting for her because she started her career on her knees and worked her way up appointment after appointment.
[00:44:54.905 --> 00:44:59.130]  She leveraged her way through diversity, equity, and inclusion into a vice president seat.
[00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:08.039]  And then she catalyzed and coordinated and conspired with Nancy Pelosi to establish a coup against the sitting president of her very own administration.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:22.613]  To ensure that he was forced by blackmail under a 25th Amendment exercise to leave the race prematurely so that she could be installed as the presidential candidate despite the fact that nobody in her party voted for her in the primary that voted for Joe Biden.
[00:45:23.775 --> 00:45:26.437]  I know, I'm no Joe Biden fan, but this was absolutely stolen from him.
[00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:28.439]  This was a DNC coup.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.842]  It was everything they said that January 6th lost.
[00:45:32.654 --> 00:45:47.578]  They're not voting for Kamala Harris because, not because she's a woman, but because she advocates for equity instead of equality, where she wants an equal outcome, where everyone is equally impoverished instead of unequally prosperous.
[00:45:48.238 --> 00:45:50.179]  The men I know who are- All right, let's stop right there.
[00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:51.239]  It goes on for five minutes.
[00:45:51.279 --> 00:45:54.000]  Now, this is one they're putting in the news that's saying it should be illegal.
[00:45:54.966 --> 00:46:06.397]  It's Laura Ingraham, you can tell it's not live, his mouth is moving wrong, the head looks like an animatronic Chuck E. Cheese thing, and he's saying ridiculous stuff that are her real policies, but she lies about it.
[00:46:07.578 --> 00:46:12.643]  So, maybe they'll say I just put out a lie, then have some grand jury indict me.
[00:46:13.564 --> 00:46:16.287]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:46:17.771 --> 00:46:21.773]  And we shouldn't wait, the Supreme Court shouldn't wait, until they start indicting people.
[00:46:21.793 --> 00:46:31.897]  The Supreme Court can take special interest in the law and come right down and send a directive to the, what is it, Ninth Circuit, or what's the one in San Francisco?
[00:46:31.917 --> 00:46:32.718]  That's the Ninth, right?
[00:46:33.138 --> 00:46:34.259]  Let's look up what circuits in San Francisco.
[00:46:34.299 --> 00:46:34.859]  It's really bad.
[00:46:36.328 --> 00:46:36.848]  That's the night.
[00:46:37.049 --> 00:46:38.770]  And say, you're not doing this.
[00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.031]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:46:40.211 --> 00:46:41.892]  But look, this is not happening in a vacuum.
[00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.813]  As I said earlier, here's some of the headlines.
[00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:50.518]  Hillary Clinton, who spread election propaganda for years, wants to jail Americans for misinformation that they decide is that.
[00:46:53.961 --> 00:47:00.405]  Elon Musk being investigated after post about Biden, Harris, and the second Trump assassination by the feds.
[00:47:00.805 --> 00:47:02.186]  Saying, why has anybody tried to kill?
[00:47:03.257 --> 00:47:07.240]  Kamala or Biden, obviously saying is that they're puppets of the deep state.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.381]  They're the ones trying to kill Trump.
[00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:10.262]  That's not a threat.
[00:47:10.922 --> 00:47:11.903]  Well, they say it is.
[00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:16.306]  Klaus Schwab calls for global collaboration to combat misinformation.
[00:47:17.727 --> 00:47:19.668]  Wants to work with communist China and everybody else.
[00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:22.029]  You got to read this article.
[00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.770]  It goes through it all.
[00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:30.355]  They got their big report out saying the main goal is governments and legacy media to counter misinformation and outlaw it.
[00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:40.353]  During the press conference, KJP says it's dangerous to ask Biden-Harris to stop calling Trump a threat after second assassination attempt.
[00:47:40.373 --> 00:47:41.214]  The video's crazy.
[00:47:43.435 --> 00:47:45.936]  He says it's dangerous for you to say we've got dangerous rhetoric.
[00:47:46.776 --> 00:47:50.478]  Spanish government to restrict freedom of information to, quote, save democracy.
[00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:53.779]  Here's some of the examples around the world.
[00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:58.201]  Australian woman fired, dragged before tribunal for saying only women can breastfeed.
[00:47:59.222 --> 00:48:00.702]  Whether she's right or wrong, of course she's right.
[00:48:01.062 --> 00:48:01.683]  She has that right.
[00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:08.492]  Canadian military, oh, wanted to investigate removal of tampons from male washrooms as hate crimes.
[00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:10.773]  Yeah, Tampon Tim approves of that.
[00:48:12.413 --> 00:48:17.375]  UK backlash intensifies as ex-BBC presenter avoids jail time over pedophilia.
[00:48:19.055 --> 00:48:24.016]  AI chatbot mind-sucking machine developed to change the brains of conspiracy theorists.
[00:48:25.537 --> 00:48:31.198]  Germany to train conductors urged not to check tickets of foreigners to keep the peace.
[00:48:32.671 --> 00:48:33.291]  They're above the law.
[00:48:35.113 --> 00:48:37.755]  Elon Musk shared memes made by FSB propagandists.
[00:48:37.775 --> 00:48:38.635]  You know the Russians.
[00:48:39.156 --> 00:48:42.058]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:48:42.238 --> 00:48:43.219]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:45.460]  Huge developments in the economy.
[00:48:45.721 --> 00:48:47.882]  Huge developments worldwide on that.
[00:48:47.902 --> 00:48:48.663]  Some of the biggest yet.
[00:48:48.723 --> 00:48:49.804]  Wait till you see this stack.
[00:48:50.384 --> 00:48:51.665]  And news clubs that are coming up.
[00:48:51.685 --> 00:48:54.067]  And then Ivan Reikland, former Green Beret.
[00:48:54.327 --> 00:48:55.568]  Colonel, really smart guy.
[00:48:55.588 --> 00:49:00.652]  Defense Intelligence Agency lawyer on what's really happening with what the globals are planning with this election coming up.
[00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:03.889]  Why they're talking about civil war and how we counter them.

[00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.571]  I love fighting the globalists.
[00:51:24.991 --> 00:51:25.731]  This is what I do.
[00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:27.732]  We've had such a huge effect together.

[00:51:59.307 --> 00:52:00.628]  That goes back to 1x next week.
[00:52:01.068 --> 00:52:04.350]  Today's conspiracy theories, tomorrow's truths.
[00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:09.173]  Some of these conspiracy theories have turned out to be true.
[00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.067]  Which ones?
[00:52:11.747 --> 00:52:40.156]  The Trump-Russia witch hunt, Jeffrey Epstein, JFK assassination, the misuse of the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the weapons of mass destruction, the war in Ukraine, the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipeline, the open border migration caravans, the climate change scam, Kim Trails, and HARP, and 9-11 being an inside job, and the Internet of Things surveillance grid, and PFAs, and chemicals in the water turning everyone gay, and the 2020 election being stolen, and January 6 being filled with undercover feds, and Bilderberg, and Bohemian Grove, and global government, not to mention gain-of-function research, and the threat of China,
[00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:42.217]  You will meet so many amazing people wearing this shirt.
[00:52:42.277 --> 00:52:44.759]  I'd say you'll get probably 50 compliments before you get one person screaming at you.
[00:53:06.005 --> 00:53:09.830]  But it's an adventure to wear any of these shirts but particularly this one.

[00:53:14.777 --> 00:53:20.825]  Keep us on air in our fight against the globalists and I want to thank you so much for your support because literally when you
[00:53:20.845 --> 00:53:23.728]  When you call in thanking me on air, I say, stop, because I'm thanking you.
[00:53:24.048 --> 00:53:25.430]  I love fighting the globalists.
[00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.571]  This is what I do.
[00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:28.593]  We've had such a huge effect together.
[00:53:29.034 --> 00:53:42.008]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and encourage you now to go to thealexshowstore.com and be sure to enter for the free truck and $10,000 and buy more product, support the broadcast, and get entered five or ten times, depending on the day, each time you buy a product.
[00:53:42.188 --> 00:53:50.396]  This new initiative is so important to the future, so everybody, if you support what we're doing and want to get great shirts and ball caps at the same time, go to thealexjonestore.com.
[00:53:50.596 --> 00:53:53.019]  And I almost forgot, most of these shirts come in multiple colors.
[00:53:56.124 --> 00:54:01.086]  All right, I want to be very, very laser-focused, clear here with everybody as we go into the second hour.
[00:54:01.146 --> 00:54:05.829]  Ivan Reiklin, former Green Beret colonel, on the globalist plans to try to kill Trump again.
[00:54:05.849 --> 00:54:08.110]  There are open announcements of civil war conditions.
[00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.810]  What are they planning?
[00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:09.450]  How do we counter them?
[00:54:09.911 --> 00:54:11.611]  Could be a more important topic coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:54:11.631 --> 00:54:20.656]  But I wanted, for days, and he's been so busy he couldn't come on, to get Dr. Kirk Elliott, one of the best economists out there, 25-plus years, the gold and silver business, on.
[00:54:21.576 --> 00:54:23.277]  As soon as I saw this headline this weekend,
[00:54:24.542 --> 00:54:29.105]  Saudi Arabia's central bank caught secretly buying 160 tons of gold in Switzerland.
[00:54:32.287 --> 00:54:38.010]  It is a no-brainer with this inflationary system and all that's happening and the end of the current financial system looming.
[00:54:39.002 --> 00:54:42.925]  All the bank failures and the rest of it, they're trying to keep quiet to get into silver and gold.
[00:54:42.965 --> 00:54:45.286]  It's the best investment hands down in the last five years.
[00:54:46.407 --> 00:54:47.988]  It's a hedge against inflation.
[00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:49.850]  He is a great sponsor.
[00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:53.292]  You should go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:56.995]  That way he knows it's coming from us and we get support here.
[00:54:58.234 --> 00:55:02.077]  They have the best deals right now on wholesale silver and gold.
[00:55:02.597 --> 00:55:05.559]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:09.181]  We'll put that on screen for folks and the toll free number.
[00:55:10.002 --> 00:55:13.924]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720605300.
[00:55:17.527 --> 00:55:18.787]  But we'll get to that at the end of the interview.
[00:55:18.807 --> 00:55:19.808]  We got a lot to cover.
[00:55:20.068 --> 00:55:22.310]  He sent a huge stack
[00:55:23.411 --> 00:55:23.891]  I don't know.
[00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:44.479]  Fifty-nine minutes is going to announce their rate cut.
[00:56:10.816 --> 00:56:15.277]  Everything that we're seeing, Alex, is a complete fallacy.
[00:56:15.357 --> 00:56:16.317]  It's a facade.
[00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:18.778]  Our whole economy is based on debt.
[00:56:19.478 --> 00:56:22.759]  Now, the interest payments on that debt are going through the ceiling.
[00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.139]  Inflation is coming.
[00:56:24.659 --> 00:56:35.001]  And I want to show, I have a couple of charts that I sent to you on what happens when we go into a series of rate cuts throughout history, like in 2000, 2009, after those big
[00:56:38.382 --> 00:56:41.044]  Corrections that we had and collapses in the markets.
[00:56:41.584 --> 00:56:45.046]  What happened after that with inflation?
[00:56:45.366 --> 00:56:51.971]  What happened after that with things like precious metals that we're talking about as a protective way to to get through this?
[00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:53.552]  So we're going to go over that.
[00:56:54.212 --> 00:57:00.215]  We're also, I'm going to talk about something that I think is really, really big.
[00:57:00.355 --> 00:57:01.056]  I mean, huge.
[00:57:01.536 --> 00:57:18.285]  So, we've talked a lot about central bank digital currency over the last year, and just recently, like last week, the Bank for International Settlements came up with a new, basically, project called Project Agora.
[00:57:19.005 --> 00:57:21.608]  So Agora in Greek means marketplace.
[00:57:21.648 --> 00:57:24.030]  So what they're wanting to do, and words have meaning, right?
[00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.354]  So they want to bring everything together under the unified ledger.
[00:57:28.434 --> 00:57:37.803]  We've talked about the dangers of the unified ledger and how it's programmable money and they can change ownership from you to them with a flip of a switch.
[00:57:38.204 --> 00:57:39.905]  Now in this document,
[00:57:40.546 --> 00:57:51.669]  There's over 40 banks that have said, and financial institutions said, we are going to participate with you, Bank for International Settlements, and we are going to participate in the Unified Ledger Program.
[00:57:51.689 --> 00:57:59.611]  So our clients basically are having all of their assets tokenized so they can be programmable and change ownership.
[00:57:59.671 --> 00:58:00.151]  It's like, what?
[00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:09.514]  So we're going to go over who some of those financial institutions actually are, because to me, that is the ultimate loss of privacy and freedom ever.
[00:58:10.234 --> 00:58:16.136]  It is the holy grail of the Mark of the Beast, total control in their own words to make us do everything they say.
[00:58:16.736 --> 00:58:18.217]  It is a hellish prospect.
[00:58:18.837 --> 00:58:19.857]  Stay there, Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[00:58:19.877 --> 00:58:22.038]  We'll join a bunch of stations in 60 seconds.
[00:58:22.578 --> 00:58:28.420]  We'll plunge into all the graphs, all the charts, and what's going on with Saudi Arabia buying hundreds of billions of dollars of gold secretly.
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.001]  Why would they do it secretly?
[00:58:30.061 --> 00:58:31.141]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:31.161 --> 00:58:31.601]  Stay with us.
[00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:33.142]  Follow me on Real Alex Jones.
[00:58:33.722 --> 00:58:39.444]  All right, the Federal Reserve in under an hour is set to announce how big the rate cut's going to be.
[00:58:41.127 --> 00:58:44.788]  And that, again, has an effect on everybody in the economy, not just here, but also the world.
[00:58:46.169 --> 00:58:57.033]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, months ago, said that there's record buying by central banks, billionaires, governments, institutions, but they're trying to keep it secret because they don't want to drive up the price too much.
[00:58:57.053 --> 00:59:00.294]  Well, Saudi Arabia just got caught secretly buying $150 billion of gold.
[00:59:03.223 --> 00:59:05.164]  And we're already under serious inflation.
[00:59:05.184 --> 00:59:06.904]  You don't need the media to tell you that.
[00:59:06.984 --> 00:59:09.425]  You don't need Biden to tell you it's actually under control.
[00:59:09.485 --> 00:59:10.145]  You know it's bad.
[00:59:10.185 --> 00:59:14.326]  We know they put out 800 plus thousand fake job numbers.
[00:59:14.366 --> 00:59:17.888]  Then it turned out the last few months they put out fake job numbers.
[00:59:18.508 --> 00:59:28.851]  They also just got caught last week with record low new jobs being created and a massive slowdown in manufacturing.
[00:59:28.871 --> 00:59:29.951]  That's the main indicator.
[00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:31.752]  So we have a huge stack
[00:59:32.697 --> 00:59:44.619]  In the 25 minutes we have left with Dr. Kirk Elliott joining us to hit this, so I just asked him graciously to come on the last 20 minutes of the third hour once we know what the Federal Reserve's done and the aftermath.
[00:59:45.905 --> 00:59:47.986]  To hit this again once we have the intel.
[00:59:48.006 --> 00:59:51.427]  But he's going to make a prediction on what he thinks the Fed is going to do here in a moment.
[00:59:51.467 --> 00:59:52.807]  So you've got the floor here.
[00:59:52.827 --> 00:59:55.088]  I'm going to try to not interrupt until the end of the interview.
[00:59:55.909 --> 01:00:01.651]  Dr. Elliott, very respected economist with an incredible record of accurately predicting and nailing it, sir.
[01:00:02.531 --> 01:00:04.812]  So you've got control here.
[01:00:04.832 --> 01:00:05.492]  You've got the charts.
[01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:06.932]  When you're ready for the video, tell people, go ahead.
[01:00:08.999 --> 01:00:16.483]  So today, in an hour, and I'll come back later, like you asked, I think that's great, the Fed is going to be meeting.
[01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:22.386]  So here's the problem that they have, Alex, and so are they going to lower rates today?
[01:00:22.406 --> 01:00:22.666]  Yes.
[01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:26.729]  My prediction is 100% they're going to lower rates because
[01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:35.965]  If they don't, you know, you've got investors all over the country that are that are hoping for a soft landing of this economy.
[01:00:36.005 --> 01:00:36.186]  Right.
[01:00:36.246 --> 01:00:41.411]  And so so the soft landing means are they going to be able to avoid a recession?
[01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.712]  That's what that means.
[01:00:43.213 --> 01:00:47.077]  So are they going to do a quarter of a point or half a point?
[01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:50.898]  Right, so there's this letter that I sent you.
[01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:52.319]  U.S.
[01:00:52.359 --> 01:00:56.180]  senators asked for a 0.75% rate cut.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:05.764]  You know, they're wanting even more because going into an election, you don't want to go into an election with a huge recession on your hands, right?
[01:01:05.804 --> 01:01:09.205]  Because like Clinton said, it's the economy, stupid.
[01:01:09.245 --> 01:01:11.246]  People are going to vote with their wallets, right?
[01:01:11.566 --> 01:01:13.987]  But here's the problem that the Fed has.
[01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:17.991]  They haven't tamed the inflation beast, Alex.
[01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:21.094]  We still have massive amounts of inflation.
[01:01:21.475 --> 01:01:29.003]  When you lower interest rates, when inflation is still persisting, it's going to make inflation worse.
[01:01:29.844 --> 01:01:36.169]  Right, so if you raise rates, that puts us into a deeper recession.
[01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:40.772]  If you keep rates the same, it puts us into, keeps us in a recession.
[01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:43.494]  So I think their hands are tied, right?
[01:01:43.554 --> 01:01:45.696]  It's like, well, are we going to choose recession?
[01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:47.117]  Are we going to choose inflation?
[01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:56.384]  They are choosing inflation, which is going to be bad for America because the policies that come after that are going to be pretty extreme.
[01:01:57.745 --> 01:02:00.267]  What are some of those things that are going to follow?
[01:02:00.848 --> 01:02:08.453]  Now, we look at the interest payments on our national debt, just the interest only.
[01:02:09.014 --> 01:02:13.577]  It just surpassed a trillion dollars for the first time ever.
[01:02:14.418 --> 01:02:14.638]  Ever.
[01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:16.520]  And it's like, you think about that.
[01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:23.086]  Well, shoot, we bring in $4.8 trillion a year in federal tax revenue as a nation.
[01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:33.756]  And now that we're paying over a trillion dollars in interest only payments, that's over 20 percent of everything that we bring in as a nation is going towards debt service.
[01:02:34.377 --> 01:02:34.757]  That's it.
[01:02:35.538 --> 01:02:48.863]  Right, so ultimately though, and I've said this in the past numerous times, that we're going to have one to two rate decreases before the election because they need to save face.
[01:02:49.343 --> 01:02:53.405]  Now, they're talking about this soft landing, right?
[01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:54.845]  Everybody wants a soft landing.
[01:02:54.885 --> 01:02:57.546]  Jerome Powell talks about, oh, we need a soft landing, blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:58.086 --> 01:03:01.968]  Well, their actions and what they're starting to say
[01:03:02.748 --> 01:03:21.509]  are violating a what a soft landing would require because just a few day well before the media silence before this this meeting right they the Fed can't really talk about anything for a bit but but a week ago Jerome Powell said we're probably going to expect eight
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.792]  Eight rate reductions over the next six periods?
[01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:25.593]  It's like, what?
[01:03:25.933 --> 01:03:26.113]  Eight?
[01:03:26.734 --> 01:03:30.797]  That does not connotate expectations of a soft landing.
[01:03:31.318 --> 01:03:35.762]  That says we are going to be fighting a recession really hard.
[01:03:36.122 --> 01:03:37.103]  Like, really hard.
[01:03:37.483 --> 01:03:42.488]  And if they actually do that much, inflation goes through the ceiling, Alex.
[01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:44.650]  And this is not what anybody wants.
[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:45.731]  So they've got this catch-22.
[01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:45.991]  It's like,
[01:03:47.592 --> 01:03:49.533]  Do we do we do too little?
[01:03:49.674 --> 01:03:50.934]  Or do we do too much?
[01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:52.416]  And are we doing it too soon?
[01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:54.277]  This is the problem that they have.
[01:03:54.357 --> 01:03:58.540]  But they've chosen inflation over recession.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.382]  And this is going to have an impact on the market.
[01:04:01.442 --> 01:04:07.847]  So my prediction today, is it going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points, you know, a quarter half?
[01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:11.425]  I'm leaning like 60-40 that it's going to be 50.
[01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:22.913]  Just because I think they really want to make a name for themselves saying, look, we are going to fight this and fight this hard and rates have been too high for too long.
[01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:27.516]  I wouldn't be surprised if we get a quarter either because they're kind of pansies on it.
[01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:29.678]  They know what the inflationary pressures are.
[01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.639]  But but my guess would be 50.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.522]  And if it's 25, you know, it's 40 percent of my guess.
[01:04:36.842 --> 01:04:39.164]  But but anyways, this is where we're headed now.
[01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:39.505]  Yeah.
[01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:45.335]  Look at what the economy, why they're so afraid of a recession, Alex.
[01:04:45.355 --> 01:04:52.039]  So Goldman Sachs, I didn't even know that they had credit cards, but they do.
[01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:53.600]  They have credit cards, right?
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.464]  They were the initial issuer of the Apple card, the white Apple card that came out.
[01:04:59.925 --> 01:05:08.711]  Well, they are being hit now with $6 billion in credit card losses because people don't have enough money.
[01:05:09.491 --> 01:05:11.652]  They simply don't have enough money to pay their bills.
[01:05:12.012 --> 01:05:16.553]  And there's delinquencies, and there's defaults, and they're being hit with $6 billion.
[01:05:16.733 --> 01:05:26.536]  It's like, hmm, no wonder the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, is dumping Bank of America shares like it's yesterday's trash.
[01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:32.857]  Because since July, he's now dumped $7 billion of Bank of America shares.
[01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:34.918]  And that was one of his
[01:05:35.618 --> 01:05:37.039]  You know, that was one of his babies.
[01:05:37.459 --> 01:05:39.160]  It was one of his great stocks.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.401]  He loved Apple and he loved Bank of America.
[01:05:41.781 --> 01:05:50.786]  Well, now, when you are a large shareholder in a company, if you're more than 10%, everything that you do is public, right?
[01:05:50.806 --> 01:05:52.427]  They don't want insider trading, whatever.
[01:05:52.487 --> 01:05:53.688]  So he has to report it.
[01:05:54.228 --> 01:05:57.890]  At this point, he's real close to that 10% threshold.
[01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:01.232]  So when he goes under it, we're not going to know anymore what he's dumping.
[01:06:01.272 --> 01:06:03.874]  He could get rid of all of his Bank of America shares.
[01:06:04.714 --> 01:06:07.976]  And we wouldn't know about it because he doesn't have to report it if it's less than 10%.
[01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:11.939]  But here's the whole point behind this story.
[01:06:12.499 --> 01:06:23.166]  Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, one of the wealthiest people in the world, does not see a happy ending for Bank of America and for the banking sector as a whole.
[01:06:23.506 --> 01:06:26.969]  Or else he would be keeping the shares or buying more of them.
[01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:29.071]  So it's a major bellwether.
[01:06:29.171 --> 01:06:32.815]  So is Apple, one of the top banking stocks and the top tech stock.
[01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:34.698]  He's dumped 55% of Apple.
[01:06:35.178 --> 01:06:38.763]  He's dumped over $7 billion of Bank of America.
[01:06:38.783 --> 01:06:39.363]  I mean, that's seismic.
[01:06:41.496 --> 01:06:42.517]  That is seismic.
[01:06:42.897 --> 01:06:44.358]  That is massive.
[01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:46.459]  So why is he thinking this, right?
[01:06:46.499 --> 01:06:56.747]  Well, when people are living hand-to-mouth, this is part of the interest rate reduction plan, where when you lower interest rates, it's supposed to stimulate the economy because it will encourage people to spend.
[01:06:57.227 --> 01:06:59.889]  But what if people don't have any money to spend, Alex?
[01:06:59.929 --> 01:07:02.671]  Like most of the people in America living paycheck to paycheck,
[01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:08.819]  Interest rates could go to zero and they're not going to spend anymore because they're tapped out.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:09.980]  They're tapped out.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.123]  And this is the fallacy that we're seeing now.
[01:07:12.644 --> 01:07:18.392]  Debt has become so huge and people's wages have come down under Bidenomics.
[01:07:19.253 --> 01:07:25.456]  And their unemployment is persisting and taxes are sky high that you could keep lowering interest rates.
[01:07:25.496 --> 01:07:30.278]  And it's not going to really encourage people to spend at this point because they're living at the margin.
[01:07:30.318 --> 01:07:32.939]  There isn't any excess to really spend.
[01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:42.783]  So when this happens, government revenues come down, taxes come down, you know, sales tax revenues, property tax revenues, income tax revenues and so forth.
[01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:46.165]  So they're going to be forced to print their way out of everything.
[01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:50.488]  Especially when we lost petrodollar status, right?
[01:07:50.548 --> 01:07:54.232]  So January of this year through the BRICS nations.
[01:07:54.532 --> 01:07:55.413]  So what does this mean?
[01:07:55.453 --> 01:07:58.455]  This means inflation is going to get worse.
[01:07:58.535 --> 01:08:06.682]  So the next chart on that list that I sent you talks about how the historic inflation comparison.
[01:08:07.222 --> 01:08:13.448]  Look what happens to inflation and prices when you start cutting rates.
[01:08:14.088 --> 01:08:19.814]  So there's this chart that shows the core CPI and the inflation numbers, and look at where we are.
[01:08:20.195 --> 01:08:24.560]  The Fed starts cutting rates on that blue line.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:25.901]  That was from 1966 to 1982.
[01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:34.516]  Now in red, you know, this is very reminiscent of where we are today, right?
[01:08:34.556 --> 01:08:40.042]  So when you lower interest rates, inflation persists, right?
[01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:41.424]  And this was right where we're now.
[01:08:41.824 --> 01:08:45.448]  Jerome Powell says we're going to lower rates and we're going to have a series of lowering rates.
[01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.271]  Inflation is going to go through the roof, Alex.
[01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:49.231]  Through the roof.
[01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.333]  And this is going to be bad for America.
[01:08:51.793 --> 01:08:55.655]  This is going to be bad for everybody who's living at the margin.
[01:08:56.216 --> 01:09:00.199]  And so can he avoid a recession?
[01:09:00.499 --> 01:09:02.300]  Can Jerome Powell avoid a recession?
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.461]  The answer is yeah.
[01:09:05.382 --> 01:09:12.106]  He can avoid a recession by going into stagflation, right, and having a stagnant economy with higher prices.
[01:09:12.146 --> 01:09:13.687]  That's worse than a recession.
[01:09:13.747 --> 01:09:19.550]  So he can avoid that, but what the avoidance is, it's like making it worse.
[01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:23.612]  It's like jumping, trying to jump off the, you're in the middle of the street.
[01:09:23.632 --> 01:09:27.354]  Sure, so watching what they're doing, Dr. Elliott, in layman's terms, what's going to happen?
[01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:35.488]  Oh, we go into a series, a stage in our economy where the economy is slowing down.
[01:09:35.588 --> 01:09:36.809]  People are losing jobs.
[01:09:36.869 --> 01:09:38.349]  Inflation is persisting.
[01:09:38.389 --> 01:09:39.510]  That's stagflation.
[01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:46.933]  When people have less to pay for things, but the prices of everything that they're paying for go up, that's stagflation.
[01:09:47.273 --> 01:09:50.015]  That is a policymaker's worst nightmare.
[01:09:50.655 --> 01:09:53.576]  And so you're going to see I think that's where we're headed to.
[01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:56.898]  It's like the late 70s, early 80s all over again.
[01:09:56.918 --> 01:10:03.360]  Reagan fixed it by jacking up interest rates ultimately into the mid teens to slow down inflation.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:07.002]  So we're going to have this series of rate reductions for a little bit.
[01:10:07.702 --> 01:10:09.022]  And then they have to go up.
[01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:16.025]  They have to go up to slow down that inflation that's coming, because everything that we're seeing is a facade.
[01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:21.706]  So now you've got this precious metals complex that does really well.
[01:10:21.766 --> 01:10:23.927]  When do gold and silver do well, Alex?
[01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.548]  They do well when interest rates are going up.
[01:10:27.543 --> 01:10:28.304]  Because why?
[01:10:28.684 --> 01:10:32.826]  Because interest rates going up means the Fed is trying to slow down inflation.
[01:10:33.227 --> 01:10:36.809]  Inflation means the price of things are going up.
[01:10:37.309 --> 01:10:38.270]  What are gold and silver?
[01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:42.313]  It's a thing, just like a bicycle, just like groceries, just like oil and gas.
[01:10:42.813 --> 01:10:47.376]  So when interest rates are going up, that means inflation is going up and gold and silver do well.
[01:10:47.596 --> 01:10:48.196]  But you know what?
[01:10:48.737 --> 01:10:53.220]  Silver especially does even better when interest rates come down.
[01:10:54.246 --> 01:11:02.952]  Because when interest rates come down, that's basically signaling to the public that we're going to go into an era of economic expansion.
[01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:12.318]  And when silver is used for industrial purposes, like what we've talked about, batteries, electric vehicles, military applications, aerospace, everything.
[01:11:12.338 --> 01:11:16.001]  It's like, okay, the industrial demand for silver is going to go through the roof.
[01:11:16.281 --> 01:11:18.302]  So it does well when interest rates go up.
[01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:21.364]  It does really well when interest rates come down.
[01:11:21.584 --> 01:11:23.726]  So let me stop you because I want to get this answered.
[01:11:24.486 --> 01:11:28.387]  Headlines, CNBC, gold skyrockets as stars align for Fed rate cuts.
[01:11:28.407 --> 01:11:37.950]  And then the article I mentioned, what's going on with Saudi Arabia caught secretly buying 160 tons of gold in Switzerland.
[01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.070]  What's going on there?
[01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.631]  Sorry, I said 150 billion dollars.
[01:11:40.691 --> 01:11:42.571]  I meant 160 tons.
[01:11:42.611 --> 01:11:44.432]  That's got to be, how much money is that?
[01:11:45.362 --> 01:11:50.505]  Oh, I mean, so there's 16 ounces in a pound.
[01:11:50.545 --> 01:11:52.867]  There's 2000 pounds in a ton.
[01:11:53.387 --> 01:11:55.749]  I mean, and we're talking about 160 tons.
[01:11:55.789 --> 01:11:58.150]  That is a lot of gold.
[01:11:58.771 --> 01:12:01.192]  I mean, we're talking billions and billions and billions.
[01:12:01.232 --> 01:12:01.853]  I mean, it's a lot.
[01:12:02.313 --> 01:12:05.035]  So so why would they be doing that?
[01:12:05.515 --> 01:12:11.056]  Well, many of the BRICS nations are buying gold to back up their currency.
[01:12:11.476 --> 01:12:14.437]  And Saudi Arabia is now a BRICS nation, right?
[01:12:14.817 --> 01:12:17.438]  So China has tens of thousands of tons of gold.
[01:12:17.838 --> 01:12:19.458]  Russia has over a thousand tons.
[01:12:19.578 --> 01:12:28.060]  Poland, as you shared with me, I think it was two weeks ago, was the largest purchaser of gold this year.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:37.455]  See, these BRICS nations are amassing gold to back up their currency in knowing probably what's coming, and they want to be the world's reserve currency.
[01:12:37.495 --> 01:12:40.039]  And Putin has said he wants to back their new currency with gold.
[01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:45.901]  Yeah, they want to back their central bank digital currency with gold, not just paper money.
[01:12:46.341 --> 01:12:53.327]  They want to have digital asset that's backed with gold as this dangling carrot to get people in, right?
[01:12:53.628 --> 01:12:55.429]  Why would Saudi Arabia do it secretly?
[01:12:55.449 --> 01:12:58.812]  Because it came out, UT was doing it secretly, too.
[01:12:58.872 --> 01:12:59.373]  Institute.
[01:12:59.473 --> 01:13:00.534]  Why secretly?
[01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:16.036]  Because if they're in the plans of acquiring more, you don't want to actually have that headline out there that we're buying tons, hundreds of tons of gold because it'll jack up the price way too high, knowing that there's that much demand for it.
[01:13:16.516 --> 01:13:21.981]  But UT, University of Texas, quietly buying billions every year barely hits the news.
[01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:22.942]  That was a good move for them.
[01:13:24.303 --> 01:13:25.624]  What's their increase the last few years then?
[01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:30.774]  Well, I mean, we're probably up 30% just this year alone.
[01:13:30.814 --> 01:13:38.517]  So if they have, I mean, just imagine the amount of money that University of Texas has, right, in this endowment fund that's in gold.
[01:13:38.997 --> 01:13:46.139]  I mean, we've seen massive, massive growth to the tune of, I don't know, since they've held it, probably 70%.
[01:13:46.359 --> 01:13:52.461]  I mean, going back about, even when it was low, going back 10 years ago, every year it pops up, they're buying a billion or two billion is what I've been seeing.
[01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.362]  So how much, wow, that was a good investment.
[01:13:55.421 --> 01:13:59.502]  Well, yeah, because that long ago it was like $1,200 an ounce, and today it's like $2,600.
[01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:02.142]  I mean, they've more than doubled.
[01:14:02.562 --> 01:14:06.083]  They've more than doubled, where the stock market's not done that well.
[01:14:06.403 --> 01:14:08.564]  But here's something interesting, Alex.
[01:14:08.764 --> 01:14:17.185]  On that list, the very last one in the precious metals segment, we talked about how using precious metals is barter, right?
[01:14:17.325 --> 01:14:24.767]  If the world falls apart, if merchants don't want the currency anymore, and we need to use it to trade with people, say, Kirk, you're such a
[01:14:25.387 --> 01:14:26.948]  This is wild conspiracy.
[01:14:26.988 --> 01:14:31.830]  We're never going to have to live in a zombie apocalypse and use our silver or gold for barter, right?
[01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:33.551]  Well, Russia's doing it.
[01:14:34.351 --> 01:14:36.912]  What did Russia just do yesterday, Alex?
[01:14:36.952 --> 01:14:47.677]  The news came out that to avoid international sanctions that the US has placed on them, they are taking the gold, they have a thousand tons of gold,
[01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:48.898]  Let's expand on that.
[01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:49.378]  This is a report here.
[01:14:49.398 --> 01:14:51.000]  Goldman's commodity desk is betting on silver.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.481]  That's a big indicator.
[01:15:10.287 --> 01:15:10.627]  Huge.
[01:15:11.068 --> 01:15:16.031]  I mean, so everybody who's been saying, Kirk and Alex, you guys are morons.
[01:15:16.071 --> 01:15:17.572]  You're just trying to peddle gold and silver.
[01:15:17.592 --> 01:15:21.474]  It's like, no, it is an actual, the best investment that people have.
[01:15:21.895 --> 01:15:29.240]  Now you've got Goldman's, you've got Citibank, you've got Chase, you've got Russia, you've got other countries that are starting to amass it quietly.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.041]  Because they know what's coming.
[01:15:32.341 --> 01:15:38.902]  I'm telling you, Alex, most of these people are involved with World Economic Forum and all these billionaires are.
[01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:40.123]  They know what's coming.
[01:15:40.943 --> 01:15:41.903]  And what are they doing?
[01:15:42.103 --> 01:15:43.524]  They're fleeing for safety.
[01:15:43.904 --> 01:15:47.825]  They're not doing this because they care about everybody else.
[01:15:48.405 --> 01:15:57.433]  These people care about themselves and they're going to do everything they can for self-preservation to amass tons of wealth and protect themselves.
[01:15:57.453 --> 01:15:57.694]  Sure.
[01:15:57.734 --> 01:15:58.574]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:15:58.594 --> 01:15:59.635]  This is not even our opinion.
[01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:04.700]  So this is one of the easiest things I do is have you want to talk about this because I know it's the closest thing to a sure thing.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.462]  People are insane if they don't get into silver, which is still...
[01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:11.105]  Not performing, but it's gold, but it's rising the fastest.
[01:16:11.725 --> 01:16:17.248]  But you're going to come back in the last 20 minutes of the third hour after I have an investigative journalist on covering a whole bunch of key issues.
[01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:26.672]  But I want to get more into the private sector partners, Project Agora, because they're really the globals are forming their central bank digital currency and its total takeover.
[01:16:26.732 --> 01:16:28.333]  And that is the mark of the beast right there.
[01:16:28.773 --> 01:16:30.955]  Private sector partners joined Project Agora.
[01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:33.236]  You'll get into this.
[01:16:34.016 --> 01:16:36.297]  In the last 20-30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:16:36.937 --> 01:16:40.738]  But I want to spend some time here because you're a great sponsor, and I feel great promoting this.
[01:16:41.398 --> 01:16:42.178]  You guys charge 8%.
[01:16:42.838 --> 01:16:45.019]  You take gold and silver back for no charge.
[01:16:45.119 --> 01:16:47.439]  Almost no one big does that that I know of.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.000]  You have the highest ratings out there.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.760]  You're the biggest silver broker in North America.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.381]  25-year overnight success story.
[01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:55.422]  That's a joke, folks.
[01:16:55.442 --> 01:16:55.962]  4.7-star ratings.
[01:16:55.982 --> 01:16:56.602]  They'll look you up.
[01:16:57.202 --> 01:17:08.946]  People can call you, get a consultation, it's free, and they will break down what's going on, all the great services they offer, not just direct silver and gold, not just places to deposit it or you keep it.
[01:17:09.986 --> 01:17:10.626]  They don't sell it to you.
[01:17:10.646 --> 01:17:11.586]  They tell you where to go, folks.
[01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:12.146]  It's incredible.
[01:17:13.067 --> 01:17:14.307]  And they just make sure you're getting the best deal.
[01:17:15.247 --> 01:17:16.248]  You are the place to go.
[01:17:16.308 --> 01:17:18.208]  You have the highest ratings and you sponsor us.
[01:17:18.228 --> 01:17:19.169]  That's a total 360 win.
[01:17:20.729 --> 01:17:24.531]  I can snap my fingers and get the big gold sponsors that are on all the other big Patriot shows.
[01:17:24.571 --> 01:17:28.873]  And I'm just gonna tell you, point blank, I haven't had any for 12 years because I will not charge people 30-40% for gold.
[01:17:29.433 --> 01:17:31.414]  And I will not sell somebody a numismatic.
[01:17:31.434 --> 01:17:34.175]  If somebody's selling numismatic close to wholesale, great, that's a great deal.
[01:17:34.835 --> 01:17:35.756]  But no one's doing that.
[01:17:36.056 --> 01:17:37.897]  When you have the numismatics, they're hard to sell back.
[01:17:38.337 --> 01:17:40.418]  Not the case with the bullion.
[01:17:40.718 --> 01:17:41.598]  People need to call you.
[01:17:41.879 --> 01:17:42.699]  We got three minutes left.
[01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:46.080]  Tell people about the great services at kapm.com forward slash gold or 720-605-300.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:46.641]  People need to call now.
[01:17:50.612 --> 01:17:51.172]  Yeah, they do.
[01:17:51.332 --> 01:17:56.814]  And there's a reason why we sell and allocate into what we do.
[01:17:57.174 --> 01:18:01.055]  Because you're right, you have these rare coins and semi-rare coins, these numismatic things.
[01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:05.517]  People, I've never seen anybody ever recover from those high premiums.
[01:18:05.657 --> 01:18:06.277]  But you know what?
[01:18:06.637 --> 01:18:08.038]  You can also buy bullion
[01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:09.079]  What does that do?
[01:18:27.222 --> 01:18:37.292]  That means when it's time to liquidate, it costs nothing, we just make a quick phone call, or we type it in on the computer and lock it in, and you get wired the next day.
[01:18:37.352 --> 01:18:44.459]  We don't have to make a market for that, and there's not huge premiums that need to be overcome to get to a profit position.
[01:18:44.939 --> 01:18:49.123]  So when you've got low premium, low commission, bullion,
[01:18:49.864 --> 01:18:51.926]  That's the best of all possible scenarios.
[01:18:51.966 --> 01:18:54.188]  And we can do that in an IRA.
[01:18:54.448 --> 01:18:56.410]  We can do that outside of an IRA.
[01:18:57.011 --> 01:19:03.057]  But people have asked me a lot, Alex, over the last couple of months, especially it's like gold.
[01:19:03.157 --> 01:19:04.478]  All these central banks are buying gold.
[01:19:04.498 --> 01:19:05.479]  Why don't we go into gold?
[01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:06.680]  Why do you keep promoting silver?
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.663]  It's like, well, it's because silver is outperforming.
[01:19:10.023 --> 01:19:12.425]  We are getting really close, probably
[01:19:13.126 --> 01:19:23.510]  December of this year, maybe the first quarter of next, where we can actually implement our first ratio trade, selling the higher growth silver.
[01:19:23.710 --> 01:19:26.311]  Let's just say, for sake of illustration, it doubles.
[01:19:26.711 --> 01:19:27.932]  Doubles rate of growth of gold.
[01:19:28.272 --> 01:19:34.194]  We sell it, we go into gold, I get you almost twice as many ounces of gold then as I could have purchased for you today.
[01:19:34.755 --> 01:19:37.876]  These are the kind of things where I want to just enhance
[01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:49.857]  Not just the growth of the asset class, you know, the prices, but I want to compound the ounces that you own because... And I want to be clear, folks, it's a no-brainer, and I'm not trying to be mean, it's just true.
[01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:54.775]  Anybody you're calling trying to sell you gold is a bad decision right now.
[01:19:55.395 --> 01:20:04.318]  Silver is growing faster than when gold is already taking off, but then once you hit that point, then you take the profit from the silver, keep the other silver, use that for gold.
[01:20:04.378 --> 01:20:04.998]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:07.479]  And then you experience the explosion in gold.
[01:20:07.939 --> 01:20:08.720]  Best of both worlds.
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:09.820]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.842]  But you guys will walk people through it.
[01:20:12.222 --> 01:20:13.163]  You have the mathematics.
[01:20:13.424 --> 01:20:16.827]  People can do a calculator for themselves and see what you're saying is true.
[01:20:16.847 --> 01:20:19.570]  It's not like you don't have... There's more gold he can get than silver.
[01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:22.714]  Silver's harder to get, folks, for Elliot.
[01:20:22.834 --> 01:20:24.176]  So he's selling you...
[01:20:25.681 --> 01:20:28.104]  They admit there's shortages in the mining of it.
[01:20:28.944 --> 01:20:29.525]  It's crazy.
[01:20:29.605 --> 01:20:34.290]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 7206053900.
[01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.130]  Call them today.
[01:20:35.171 --> 01:20:35.811]  They're really busy.
[01:20:35.851 --> 01:20:37.152]  They call you back in a few hours or a day.
[01:20:37.172 --> 01:20:38.334]  It's not because they don't love you.
[01:20:38.374 --> 01:20:39.635]  They just are getting flooded right now.
[01:20:39.655 --> 01:20:39.635]  7206053900.
[01:20:39.975 --> 01:20:41.316]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:41.697]  Dr. Elliott.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.126]  The Fed will announce in, what, 30-something minutes what the rate's going to be.
[01:20:48.146 --> 01:20:53.618]  You're guessing 50% of a percent, half a point.
[01:20:53.938 --> 01:20:54.660]  We'll talk to you then.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.461]  We'll talk to you.
[01:20:55.582 --> 01:20:56.042]  God bless you.
[01:20:56.721 --> 01:21:02.365]  Now, a lot of you will recognize this bad boy because it was a limited edition bestseller years ago.
[01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:05.967]  We've updated it and brought it back due to your demanding it.
[01:21:06.308 --> 01:21:07.709]  And it is a conservation shirt.
[01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.310]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:16.255]  Atrazine's literally sterilizing and killing frog populations and bending the gender of our young boys and giving our girls cancer.
[01:21:16.355 --> 01:21:18.116]  So this is a real conservation shirt.
[01:21:18.136 --> 01:21:25.121]  You can serve our operation, keep us on air, and stand up for amphibian life that are being poisoned by the chemicals that are turning the frogs gay.
[01:21:26.907 --> 01:21:30.228]  I love this shirt as well, because the left's always acting like they're the mavericks.
[01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:31.569]  They're the trailblazers.
[01:21:31.609 --> 01:21:32.309]  They're the outlaws.
[01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:36.291]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are the rebels against the globalists.
[01:21:36.771 --> 01:21:37.651]  We are the resistance.
[01:21:38.212 --> 01:21:39.952]  And I'm voting for the outlaw.
[01:21:43.694 --> 01:21:49.256]  Fight the tyrants at point blank range and meet like-minded people and spread the word of the third dimension.
[01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.277]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[01:21:52.477 --> 01:21:53.398]  TheAlexJonesStore.com

[01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:28.855]  Now, you're getting the colors I like the best.
[01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:31.616]  This dark green, this black, the red pinstripe.
[01:22:31.636 --> 01:22:35.017]  But what really matters is the shocks, the giant tires, the engine.
[01:22:35.337 --> 01:22:38.638]  Folks, I've had a lot of big trucks, but I'm telling you, they don't even compare to this.
[01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:39.638]  Be part of this.
[01:22:39.658 --> 01:22:40.339]  Be part of history.
[01:22:40.359 --> 01:22:41.379]  Be part of saving the republic.
[01:22:41.819 --> 01:22:43.200]  And believe me, you want this truck.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.700]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:22:45.941 --> 01:22:46.541]  I'll see you there.
[01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:51.202]  And I can't wait to find out who the lucky winner is going to be.
[01:22:51.302 --> 01:22:52.823]  I'm telling you, this is better than sex.
[01:22:56.437 --> 01:23:09.870]  Alright folks, I can't give out all the strategy about M4 Wars at this point, but we got about a 70% chance on surviving, and I am spending 3-4 hours a day behind the scenes dealing with unbelievable crap.
[01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:20.673]  From the Biden Justice Department and the bankruptcy system, but the judge is not working with them and has fired their operatives that tried to criminally shut us down 10 weeks ago.
[01:23:21.133 --> 01:23:22.633]  You saw it, he'll be shut down in a week.
[01:23:22.673 --> 01:23:24.134]  They went in, the judge fired them.
[01:23:24.174 --> 01:23:26.655]  I mean, it's vigilanteism by the Justice Department.
[01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:29.616]  They're attacking anybody that they think is prominent supporting Trump.
[01:23:29.896 --> 01:23:34.198]  They're trying to get through Trump and me and Ivan Reikland and Tucker Carlson to get to you.
[01:23:34.878 --> 01:23:39.820]  But there's so many other great people like Charlie Kirk and, you know, the list just goes on and on.
[01:23:40.911 --> 01:23:41.512]  In this fight.
[01:23:42.613 --> 01:23:47.758]  So when I tell listeners, I don't want to be sitting here plugging every segment, but I'll plug as much as I have to.
[01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:53.525]  You know, I'll do anything but, you know, sell my daughters to the Islamists or something to beat the new world order.
[01:23:53.925 --> 01:23:56.127]  I'm not afraid of anything except losing to these people.
[01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:57.749]  That's a fate worse than death.
[01:23:57.789 --> 01:24:00.032]  And I'll never sell out, never back down, but I could give out.
[01:24:01.294 --> 01:24:05.640]  So I'm asking you to support the broadcasting of great products at the same time.
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.544]  Go to our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:24:08.704 --> 01:24:15.092]  Nanosilver products, next-level foundational energy, Cabochill, Rocket Rest, Top Brain is a stimulant, very clean, very powerful.
[01:24:16.454 --> 01:24:20.375]  I mean, I had Kyle Rittenhouse in here yesterday, and he said, I'm kind of tired.
[01:24:20.415 --> 01:24:22.556]  I hear this brain force is good.
[01:24:23.076 --> 01:24:25.017]  And I said, sure, I'll go get a cup of coffee.
[01:24:25.077 --> 01:24:26.057]  He takes two of them.
[01:24:26.137 --> 01:24:28.918]  An hour later, he said, my God, my mind's blown.
[01:24:29.278 --> 01:24:30.659]  He even said he'd shoot a video about it.
[01:24:30.679 --> 01:24:31.399]  I haven't aired that yet.
[01:24:31.459 --> 01:24:32.619]  I'll give it to the crew during a break.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.900]  I just remembered I did that.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.861]  None of this stuff's a joke, okay?
[01:24:35.881 --> 01:24:40.545]  Our vitamin C, 1,000 milligram, organic, with rose hips, and with zinc.
[01:24:40.865 --> 01:24:42.326]  So good for your whole body immune system.
[01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:43.607]  Everybody should be on that.
[01:24:43.627 --> 01:24:43.788]  40% off.
[01:24:44.168 --> 01:24:46.310]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% cuminoid.
[01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:47.671]  The leading competitor is 70%.
[01:24:47.971 --> 01:24:49.472]  Most turmeric's 4% raw.
[01:24:49.692 --> 01:24:50.293]  Still works great.
[01:24:50.413 --> 01:24:51.714]  This 95% blows you away.
[01:24:52.074 --> 01:24:52.274]  Okay?
[01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.195]  Pain relief, everything.
[01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:55.357]  It's all at infowarstore.com.
[01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:56.938]  It's all at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:24:57.178 --> 01:24:57.879]  This is stuff you need.
[01:24:57.899 --> 01:25:00.901]  And by the way, people have been saying, Alex, you look great.
[01:25:00.981 --> 01:25:01.822]  I've lost 20 pounds.
[01:25:03.379 --> 01:25:18.444]  In the last five weeks, doing the same amount of exercise I was doing, I'm still exercising, because I went, wait, I always forget, my wife or somebody takes the lazy Susan off the table, I'll forget to take the supplements, six months goes by like five minutes, and I'm falling apart, I'm taking it all.
[01:25:18.945 --> 01:25:28.508]  Infowarsstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com, amazing products at both sites, make the decision to support those that are fighting with everything we've got against the globalists,
[01:25:30.114 --> 01:25:31.495]  You're the reason we've had so much success.
[01:25:31.515 --> 01:25:36.019]  You're the reason we're reaching, no exaggeration, 100 million people a week right now.
[01:25:36.079 --> 01:25:37.700]  We're back to the biggest we ever were.
[01:25:38.821 --> 01:25:40.743]  The enemy failed to take us off the air because of your support.
[01:25:41.344 --> 01:25:42.364]  I'm asking you for support.
[01:25:42.505 --> 01:25:45.687]  Infowarsstore.com or drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:25:45.787 --> 01:25:46.328]  All right.
[01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:50.732]  Ivan Reikland is a former Green Beret colonel, also a Defense Intelligence Agency guy.
[01:25:51.933 --> 01:25:53.674]  He's dialed in with all the best patriots.
[01:25:53.714 --> 01:25:55.255]  He basically lives on Capitol Hill.
[01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:12.206]  When he's not crisscrossing the country, getting attorney generals of the states and others to take action, he is really an MVP on-air and off-air, and he's always reached a lot of people since he started fighting the Globalist six years ago and doing that full-time and not just fighting bad guys around the world.
[01:26:12.846 --> 01:26:16.688]  And so I wanted to just get him to pop in because he's here in town with some work he's doing down at the Capitol.
[01:26:17.148 --> 01:26:19.550]  He went on the American Journal with Harrison this morning.
[01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:22.131]  He wants to go on Ellen, I'm sure Ellen wants him.
[01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:23.492]  He's here just to pop in.
[01:26:24.452 --> 01:26:32.436]  With some key information, understanding how the deep state's saying we're going to be in civil war conditions, martial law, all the key globalists are saying it.
[01:26:32.456 --> 01:26:33.937]  Hillary's saying arrest people for their speech.
[01:26:34.297 --> 01:26:37.038]  News have just signed a law that if they don't like a meme, you go to jail.
[01:26:37.478 --> 01:26:40.440]  They've already put people in jail, like Doug Mackey, are giving him a huge sentence.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.841]  This isn't a joke.
[01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:48.224]  This is real tyranny, like you go to the doctor, hey, you got cancer, got a 90% success rate, but we got to get it out now before it metastasizes.
[01:26:48.944 --> 01:26:50.405]  America is fighting for its life.
[01:26:51.616 --> 01:26:55.757]  But if we simply realize we're not in a normal situation and rise to it, we're going to win.
[01:26:55.797 --> 01:27:04.459]  And the good news is the attorney generals that aren't Soros-controlled, 27 or so are good, and a lot of other good DAs and people in sheriff's departments are waking up.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.380]  Florida's having its own investigation.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.860]  The governor came out and said we can't trust the feds.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:09.941]  That's the spirit.
[01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:10.561]  That's the attitude.
[01:27:10.581 --> 01:27:12.521]  Not that the federal government's bad in the Constitution.
[01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:15.202]  It's a federalist system where the power is shared and balanced.
[01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:17.303]  It's because it's seized right now.
[01:27:17.363 --> 01:27:18.924]  We have to recognize this is not our government.
[01:27:19.244 --> 01:27:19.984]  It is at war with us.
[01:27:20.264 --> 01:27:23.566]  So Ivan Reiglin, you've got the floor for the 22 minutes we've got left here.
[01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:24.907]  Trump assassination, third attempt.
[01:27:25.787 --> 01:27:32.391]  Yesterday, Constitution Day, Andy Harris, House Freedom Caucus, waking up to the Marshall Law plans, the Democrats and Jamie Raskin.
[01:27:32.991 --> 01:27:33.751]  Wargaming, U.S.
[01:27:33.771 --> 01:27:37.233]  House dynamics going into November 5th, January 3rd, January 6th, the 20th.
[01:27:37.873 --> 01:27:40.615]  Trying everything with geopolitical goals for nuclear war.
[01:27:41.195 --> 01:27:42.135]  That's a long question.
[01:27:42.155 --> 01:27:45.256]  First of all, thanks for having me on.
[01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:49.077]  You're going to host now the rest of the thing.
[01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:56.879]  I'm going to be listening to you, but I'm going to go give them some videos of my earpiece and you're hosting right now.
[01:27:56.919 --> 01:27:57.139]  Go ahead.
[01:27:57.259 --> 01:27:57.779]  I appreciate it.
[01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:03.621]  So yeah, I think big picture we need to take a look at a lot of people are focused in on the presidential election, right?
[01:28:04.221 --> 01:28:12.613]  The bigger thing that I think people need to understand is that going into this election cycle, we have not only the presidential and vice presidential election, we also have the Congress.
[01:28:12.873 --> 01:28:18.461]  Every two years, 435 members have to re-up their positions, and then one-third of the U.S.
[01:28:18.481 --> 01:28:18.701]  Senate.
[01:28:19.582 --> 01:28:27.350]  So as it applies to the House, imagine if, for example, somehow miraculously, they allow President Trump back into office, right?
[01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:29.292]  January 20th, he's gonna get sworn in.
[01:28:29.893 --> 01:28:35.699]  That still doesn't mean that he's going to be able to implement any of the policies that he's been campaigning on.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.482]  And what I mean by that is that if you have a
[01:28:39.423 --> 01:28:49.527]  Democrat House, the very first thing that Jamie Raskin has already indicated that he's going to be doing is essentially create what Alex just said, civil war conditions.
[01:28:49.747 --> 01:28:50.668]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:28:51.468 --> 01:28:56.390]  When you look at the constitutional calendar, November 5th, we have the election.
[01:28:56.910 --> 01:29:01.132]  And then the state certified transmit January 3rd, the new house comes into office.
[01:29:01.152 --> 01:29:08.635]  So three days before the joint session certification, you have a new house of representatives and a new Senate, depending on the makeup.
[01:29:09.336 --> 01:29:16.778]  Imagine if we lose the House with a Democrat House and you have Speaker of the House, excuse me, Hakeem Jeffries.
[01:29:17.844 --> 01:29:18.304]  Guess what?
[01:29:18.984 --> 01:29:30.227]  Jamie Raskin is then going to file his draft bill, which is going to label January 6th of 2021 an insurrection and President Trump as an insurrectionist.
[01:29:30.607 --> 01:29:39.709]  And thus, from their perspective, they're trying to block Trump from even being seated on January 20th under the framework of the 14th Amendment Section 3.
[01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:42.462]  That's what they are thinking.
[01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:46.463]  So like we talked about, you know, a couple times that I've been in studio, we're wargaming here.
[01:29:46.823 --> 01:30:04.711]  We're trying to figure out what they can do constitutionally within the limits of the Constitution and then based on previous precedent, what are they willing to do beyond that constitutional and legal framework to achieve their political objectives legally and from their perspective, you know, they're conducting it illegally.
[01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:09.425]  So when you understand that, then you have to come up with strategies to be able to counter that.
[01:30:09.545 --> 01:30:10.506]  Well, what does that look like?
[01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:15.552]  Okay, how do we remove Jamie Raskin, for example, from being a member of Congress?
[01:30:15.572 --> 01:30:19.777]  That's going to be a heavy lift because, well, it's a majority Democrat district.
[01:30:20.818 --> 01:30:23.641]  Well, how do we make it so that we create as much
[01:30:25.282 --> 01:30:25.823]  We're good to go.
[01:30:42.918 --> 01:30:59.206]  And as I've been observing, assessing, analyzing, interacting, not only sitting behind the scenes, right behind the biggest scum executive branch witnesses, whether it's Chris Wray, I call him Chris Wray Epps, Mayorkas, Ali Mayorkas, right, who was impeached, or any of these other executive branch scum.
[01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:05.451]  I'm basically trying to convey to them and understand where the loyalties lie.
[01:31:05.571 --> 01:31:20.894]  And one thing that a lot of people fail to understand is that the threat from Kevin McCarthy and his stranglehold and influence over the Republican conference, along with former Speaker Paul Ryan, is still pretty evident.
[01:31:21.214 --> 01:31:22.755]  They're operating behind the scenes.
[01:31:22.815 --> 01:31:28.316]  And I think that if they end up allowing, the Uniparty allows President Trump into office
[01:31:29.036 --> 01:31:35.562]  It will be under the conditions that they set for him in 2016, but there's going to have to be a bigger vice around him.
[01:31:35.963 --> 01:31:38.165]  In 2016, it was Mike Pence.
[01:31:38.685 --> 01:31:42.008]  He was basically the uniparty handler of Trump for the Bush-Cheney syndicate.
[01:31:42.609 --> 01:31:43.710]  Now that they have a J.D.
[01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:51.577]  Vance as the VP pick and an RFK basically going to be in the administration, I think that the uniparty is going to try to create a chief of staff
[01:31:52.472 --> 01:31:53.292]  Kevin McCarthy.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.962]  Kevin McCarthy was the speaker for nine months.
[01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:15.002]  What did we do?
[01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:15.623]  What did we see?
[01:32:15.843 --> 01:32:16.763]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:24.668]  All he did was send money to Ukraine, and he continued to weaponize our government against President Trump, funding a new FBI bill.
[01:32:24.688 --> 01:32:25.969]  Same thing with Mike Johnson.
[01:32:25.989 --> 01:32:28.110]  And that's all extremely important.
[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:30.932]  I'm glad you covered it, but I'm more concerned about getting there.
[01:32:30.972 --> 01:32:32.432]  It's good to war game out even that far.
[01:32:32.493 --> 01:32:35.975]  Some people say, Alex, you shouldn't be worried about the next 47 days of the election.
[01:32:36.835 --> 01:32:45.298]  And I am focused on that, but then I'm, let's say 80%, but the rest I'm focused on the 76 days when he's president-elect and the civil war conditions they say they're going to set up.
[01:32:45.618 --> 01:32:46.619]  How do we block that?
[01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:51.240]  I mean, they're not playing around here and they're all over the TV, Hillary, all of them saying, we're going to arrest you.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:54.021]  They're passing bills, California to arrest people for speech.
[01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:59.643]  I mean, these are, they are, they are preparing the battle space and trying to get it just normalized.
[01:33:00.184 --> 01:33:03.925]  They're testing their perch to really roll out a Soviet style takeover.
[01:33:04.365 --> 01:33:04.686]  I agree.
[01:33:04.706 --> 01:33:05.866]  So I think there's two components here.
[01:33:05.906 --> 01:33:14.713]  At an individual level, everybody that's listening in needs to essentially find someone that still consumes the legacy media or is still using big tech platforms that censor.
[01:33:15.113 --> 01:33:17.055]  We need to pull all those people off.
[01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:18.316]  You need to off-ramp them.
[01:33:18.496 --> 01:33:20.798]  One way to do that is to say, hey, guess what?
[01:33:20.838 --> 01:33:26.042]  Did you see the admission letter by Mark Zuckerberg where he admitted to committing what?
[01:33:26.502 --> 01:33:29.324]  Genocide is one of the components of that admission letter.
[01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:33.946]  Number two, he also admitted to providing cover for the Biden criminal syndicate laptop.
[01:33:33.986 --> 01:33:46.374]  And number three, he admitted to the Center for Tech and Civic Life through the Chan Zuckerberg initiative, where they bribed certain jurisdictions on creating electoral outcomes of their choosing.
[01:33:46.714 --> 01:33:49.776]  So all the conspiracies that were blocked
[01:33:50.256 --> 01:33:50.957]  We're good to go.
[01:34:11.076 --> 01:34:15.640]  Last month I was seeing figures 900 plus million monthly active users.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.325]  So let's just make sure that in September that goes over a billion and into October we get that into the two billion range.
[01:34:22.825 --> 01:34:32.393]  As more and more information is being divulged as us being truth tellers, we need to off ramp those people off of these legacy lying platforms.
[01:34:32.793 --> 01:34:38.758]  And then number two, institutionally, I still go back to what, you know, when Alex kind of discussed the big picture level.
[01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:45.293]  We have to do everything in our power to guarantee that there is a Republican House.
[01:34:46.073 --> 01:34:49.374]  Elections are happening in the House, the Senate, and the Presidency.
[01:34:49.795 --> 01:34:51.976]  So that's where I think the focus needs to align.
[01:34:52.096 --> 01:34:55.737]  Unfortunately, there may have to be this discussion and a compromise.
[01:34:55.777 --> 01:35:00.820]  I hate compromising with these scumbags, but they have a lot of leverage, like the Kevin McCarthy's and the Paul Ryan's.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:10.167]  So in order to regain power, we will unfortunately have to make sure that they're not our enemies and don't fully side with the Democrats.
[01:35:10.508 --> 01:35:12.049]  And that's the leverage that they bring to the table.
[01:35:12.069 --> 01:35:17.754]  And there's a lot of waiting back and seeing by the neocons and establishment rhinos to see who's going to win.
[01:35:19.861 --> 01:35:21.841]  But let's move now to the present.
[01:35:22.081 --> 01:35:23.442]  Another attempted assassination.
[01:35:23.462 --> 01:35:25.382]  The guy's got total CIA connections.
[01:35:25.422 --> 01:35:28.423]  You know all about this being a colonel in special operations.
[01:35:28.903 --> 01:35:33.344]  For people that don't know, the CIA and MI6 and NATO are running everything that happens in Ukraine.
[01:35:33.924 --> 01:35:34.624]  They've admitted this.
[01:35:34.684 --> 01:35:36.965]  I told people years ago, they admitted it last year in the New York Times.
[01:35:37.525 --> 01:35:43.886]  He's running around with all this money, flying people all around the world, recruiting all these people to go to Ukraine.
[01:35:44.226 --> 01:35:47.487]  Then he pops back out here, his entire ex-account,
[01:35:48.598 --> 01:35:52.985]  Was linked with his first person he followed is a CIA that recruits people for this stuff.
[01:35:53.606 --> 01:35:54.969]  He's linked into the deputy director.
[01:35:54.989 --> 01:35:56.892]  I mean, this guy's ridiculous.
[01:35:57.333 --> 01:36:00.318]  And then he pops in for 12 hours in the woods.
[01:36:00.358 --> 01:36:01.179]  There's no patrols.
[01:36:01.239 --> 01:36:01.900]  I mean, come on.
[01:36:02.876 --> 01:36:12.579]  So give us your expertise as a Green Beret, looking at this situation, and then how the bombs they found, oh, they didn't find bombs in... Nassau County, Long Island, yeah.
[01:36:13.099 --> 01:36:22.402]  No, so if I was running this investigation, I don't know if this is true or not, but supposedly Governor DeSantis is going to authorize the state police or local authorities... He said the feds can't be trusted.
[01:36:22.922 --> 01:36:24.323]  Absolutely, we agree with him on that one.
[01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:27.124]  One of the things that we agree on.
[01:36:27.585 --> 01:36:33.308]  But if I were running this investigation, you need to take a look at the entire geo-fenced information.
[01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:48.857]  As soon as the decision was made for President Trump to go to that golf course, every single person's communications needs to be looked into to determine how did this individual receive the information that President Trump was going to be at the golf course at that specific time.
[01:36:49.497 --> 01:36:50.918]  That's literally the chain of events.
[01:36:51.198 --> 01:36:55.899]  So the signals... And simply look at all of his signals, and then who he talked to, and who they talked to, and they run that program.
[01:36:55.979 --> 01:36:57.420]  In two seconds, it'll tell them.
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.120]  Absolutely.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:10.925]  Once we map that out on the digital landscape, then we have to basically piecemeal the geotagged location of his devices, and then determine if there are any cameras along the pathway from his whatever residence, stepping it back as maximally as possible.
[01:37:10.945 --> 01:37:14.026]  Well, he flies into town and just gets this gun automatically.
[01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.450]  Right.
[01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:18.071]  And so there's many investigative leads in the past.
[01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:28.073]  Many of them can be conducted at this point because of the technologies there to, you know, cyber sleuths, the patriots that are online, digital soldiers are doing a lot of the work already.
[01:37:28.413 --> 01:37:38.616]  So in the sense that you're probably the biggest platform that's actually putting out there and conveying what the current actual investigation, like the forefront of the investigation is.
[01:37:38.916 --> 01:37:42.097]  And so it's forcing, hopefully, the law enforcement authorities in
[01:37:42.617 --> 01:37:47.780]  Florida and maybe at some level the federal ones which we don't trust to actually get to the truth.
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:53.042]  But it's going to be on us to kind of be the forcing function so that we get to the truth.
[01:37:53.323 --> 01:37:57.125]  But I think at this point there's enough evidence to showcase it was an inside job just like the first one.
[01:37:57.665 --> 01:38:08.991]  And there needs to be serious consideration and discussion on like what are the methods to make sure we can secure President Trump or candidate Trump so that he can then safely become the president.
[01:38:09.511 --> 01:38:18.985]  And we know that any of these projects has just been declassified partially with, you know, Lee Harvey Oswald and others are even certain Syrian that they're just stand in decoys usually.
[01:38:20.464 --> 01:38:29.846]  I'm surprised though they went with a shooter twice in a row instead of a missile service to air-claiming Iranians that are poisoning him or a truck bomb or a drone attack.
[01:38:30.646 --> 01:38:38.167]  But it's obvious that they've been cooking up these operatives and these useful idiots, these ideologues ready to roll them out.
[01:38:38.567 --> 01:38:43.668]  Why do you think, I mean I think it's a no-brainer, the over preponderance of evidence that points towards deep state operations.
[01:38:43.708 --> 01:38:44.908]  Tell me if you disagree, Ivan Reikland.
[01:38:45.448 --> 01:38:48.789]  A, and then B, why do you think they went with a shooter twice in a row?
[01:38:48.809 --> 01:38:49.649]  I'm surprised by that.
[01:38:50.373 --> 01:38:51.818]  I think probably there's two components to that.
[01:38:51.838 --> 01:38:54.106]  You want to capture on video, especially the first one.
[01:38:54.146 --> 01:38:56.113]  You want it to be... And you had a GoPro the second time!
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.101]  You had, right, okay.
[01:38:58.441 --> 01:39:01.022]  So you have to have this iconic- They want that maximum political effect.
[01:39:01.422 --> 01:39:01.883]  Exactly.
[01:39:02.023 --> 01:39:09.387]  Maximum court of public opinion, political effect so they can then fundraise off of it, you know, these uniparty institutional politicians.
[01:39:09.827 --> 01:39:14.309]  And then also, it's easier to blame and create the lone gunman theory, right?
[01:39:14.329 --> 01:39:14.910]  They've already done it.
[01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:16.530]  They did it against JFK.
[01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.411]  How many years has it been?
[01:39:17.431 --> 01:39:19.692]  It was just like criminals repeat the same ops because they work.
[01:39:19.832 --> 01:39:21.153]  Just pull it off the shelf, same play.
[01:39:22.090 --> 01:39:22.571]  Because they're lazy.
[01:39:22.671 --> 01:39:25.474]  And just like Lee Harvey Oswald was in Operation Mongoose with the Cubans.
[01:39:25.754 --> 01:39:27.456]  They used an offshore thing to then bring it back.
[01:39:27.476 --> 01:39:29.017]  Instead of killing Castro, they kill Kennedy.
[01:39:29.438 --> 01:39:29.598]  Right.
[01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:38.866]  And so they pulled the same playbook, and I don't know if you had a chance to take a look, I think it was yesterday in Wisconsin, RFK was answering a question by Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:39.486 --> 01:39:44.589]  And he basically alluded, and he went to pretty significant detail, on the CIA's involvement.
[01:39:44.869 --> 01:39:48.450]  He said at this point, he knows that it's basically the CIA was behind this.
[01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:50.451]  I've seen him say that before, I didn't know he said that yesterday.
[01:39:50.471 --> 01:39:56.694]  Guys, look up RFK Jr., talks about CIA killing his dad and uncle, with Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:57.375 --> 01:39:57.735]  Keep going.
[01:39:58.868 --> 01:40:20.522]  Yeah, so, same playbook, no accountability has been had against any of these actors, so we need to start, like, instead of sitting, for us to sit back and letting them run roughshod over all of our constitutional rights, and then conducting escalatory political violence, we need to start to consider legal ways to the maximum level to stop this from happening.
[01:40:20.902 --> 01:40:21.962]  We're good to go.
[01:40:34.699 --> 01:40:36.159]  Believe that they're lone gunmen.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:52.304]  The very rhetoric that Jamie Raskin uses and then tells raw sewage slash raw story to talk about, and then these other left-wing media outlets, all it does is it inspires this radical political violence on the left.
[01:40:52.664 --> 01:41:02.507]  So they need to be held to account for their incitement of political violent rhetoric that results in already two instances of political violence.
[01:41:03.933 --> 01:41:13.678]  There's so many angles here, but what do you make of California openly passing a law where if they decide you were trying to be deceptive, you go to jail for free speech?
[01:41:14.539 --> 01:41:16.160]  I mean, this is outlawing the First Amendment.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.481]  This is crossing the line.
[01:41:18.881 --> 01:41:21.182]  Yeah, so this goes back to our conversation in February.
[01:41:21.222 --> 01:41:24.944]  I was sitting right here where we said, what are the courses of action that they're going to do?
[01:41:25.525 --> 01:41:29.207]  They're going to do cyber and they're going to do an attempted assassination.
[01:41:30.029 --> 01:41:30.549]  You nailed it.
[01:41:31.130 --> 01:41:32.671]  What does it look like tactically?
[01:41:32.811 --> 01:41:35.994]  Well, tactically, they're trying to shut down Telegram.
[01:41:36.294 --> 01:41:43.240]  And it appears as though, based on the arrest of Pavel Dorov a couple weeks ago, it appears as though the terms of service have changed up a little bit.
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:49.505]  And I'm kind of seeing as though there's a slight censorship in the terms of service change that's occurring in Telegram.
[01:41:50.085 --> 01:41:53.428]  What just happened in Brazil through the Alexan... What's his name?
[01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:54.589]  Alexander.
[01:41:55.589 --> 01:41:55.669]  Yes.
[01:41:55.689 --> 01:41:56.349]  Just like the fake dossier in 2016.
[01:41:56.389 --> 01:41:56.709]  Exactly.
[01:41:56.730 --> 01:41:59.671]  So the censorship allows them to cover up for their previous
[01:42:18.459 --> 01:42:24.401]  Operations that were illegal, and they're using their foreign partners, and the CIA is running it, right?
[01:42:24.421 --> 01:42:25.561]  And that's standard procedure.
[01:42:25.581 --> 01:42:32.784]  Ukraine, Israel, the CCP connections with the 51 spies who lied.
[01:42:33.424 --> 01:42:34.644]  There's just so much to this.
[01:42:34.704 --> 01:42:35.825]  And that's just like Kennedy.
[01:42:35.945 --> 01:42:38.325]  They had the Italian mafia, the former U.S.
[01:42:38.425 --> 01:42:40.146]  Army, CIA people.
[01:42:40.546 --> 01:42:43.407]  So there was all these swarming groups, so no one knew exactly who did it.
[01:42:44.687 --> 01:42:45.828]  Right, but I think at this point, because
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.621]  There's so many more people that have this, Alex.
[01:42:50.442 --> 01:42:52.483]  This thing right here, everyone has.
[01:42:52.963 --> 01:42:59.766]  And we now have the ability to be ahead of the intelligence community on what... And that's now happening.
[01:42:59.786 --> 01:43:04.129]  They tried to put out a fake story on Sunday when they tried to kill Trump again, that it was just two gang members shooting each other.
[01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:05.509]  That got knocked down instantly.
[01:43:05.549 --> 01:43:08.651]  So they've got to be really panicked, though, that nothing they do works now.
[01:43:09.753 --> 01:43:10.574]  Well, they're trying their best.
[01:43:10.594 --> 01:43:12.116]  I mean, they're gonna try to shut down Starlink.
[01:43:12.136 --> 01:43:16.120]  They're gonna try to shut down all this, the internet capability that Elon has produced.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:20.765]  Elon is in a much stronger position now that he's, you know, all of his holdings are pretty much now in Texas.
[01:43:21.366 --> 01:43:22.648]  And it's politically more safe.
[01:43:22.728 --> 01:43:23.288]  Smart move!
[01:43:23.829 --> 01:43:24.550]  So now, I mean...
[01:43:26.238 --> 01:43:31.703]  It's literally a battle between the richest man and the best technology in the world in Texas.
[01:43:32.144 --> 01:43:40.611]  And I think Texas is going... Elon and Texas governmental institutions are going to be the domino that starts to create so much pressure.
[01:43:40.732 --> 01:43:41.092]  That's right.
[01:43:41.152 --> 01:43:43.694]  Not just... Texas doesn't break away and become its own country.
[01:43:43.894 --> 01:43:44.855]  Texas is too small.
[01:43:45.196 --> 01:43:48.299]  We save as the Redoubt and the beachhead the whole country.
[01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:48.879]  Absolutely.
[01:43:48.899 --> 01:43:48.879]  100%.
[01:43:49.319 --> 01:43:49.680]  Full stop.
[01:43:51.479 --> 01:43:52.460]  That's what I've always said, Steve.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.480]  Oh, we're going to succeed.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:54.621]  Stop thinking small, folks.
[01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:03.232]  Pick up the phone and call Ken Paxton and say, I'm ready.
[01:44:03.432 --> 01:44:05.193]  Well, I mean, that's what's happening behind the scenes.
[01:44:05.233 --> 01:44:09.816]  And I can tell you this, Elon was just trying to run a business and innovate.
[01:44:10.457 --> 01:44:16.601]  He said that, he said at the World Economic Forum, he said at the World Government Summit last year, he said, look, you guys are going to destroy the planet.
[01:44:17.161 --> 01:44:18.742]  Just cut the populational collapse things.
[01:44:18.762 --> 01:44:19.763]  The robots aren't going to do it.
[01:44:20.424 --> 01:44:21.464]  We need a pro-human future.
[01:44:21.524 --> 01:44:21.784]  Stop.
[01:44:21.804 --> 01:44:22.605]  You're going to kill everybody.
[01:44:22.645 --> 01:44:25.447]  I mean, he's just looking at him and saying, this isn't working.
[01:44:25.727 --> 01:44:25.887]  Right.
[01:44:28.243 --> 01:44:32.965]  Their dystopian plan to make everybody poor and dumb so they can rule us is just going to cause a giant world war.
[01:44:32.985 --> 01:44:33.925]  We're all going to kill each other.
[01:44:34.445 --> 01:44:35.526]  They cut enough resources off.
[01:44:35.546 --> 01:44:37.626]  It doesn't just make people collapse and become slaves of Black Rock.
[01:44:37.926 --> 01:44:40.587]  It causes regional wars to become world wars and we're all dead.
[01:44:42.308 --> 01:44:43.528]  Prosperity is the answer.
[01:44:43.889 --> 01:44:44.669]  Freedom is the answer.
[01:44:46.175 --> 01:44:52.120]  Like you said, Elon Musk was successfully running multiple businesses and now, he's been successful at everything.
[01:44:52.681 --> 01:44:57.345]  Now he's transitioned into the political global and- Which is the final frontier.
[01:44:58.166 --> 01:45:00.908]  And I would never bet against Elon Musk.
[01:45:01.268 --> 01:45:07.013]  Now he's learning so quickly about the political landscape and he's sitting on information that no one else has.
[01:45:07.514 --> 01:45:12.819]  I suspect he's going to make a massive move going forward that will help humanity and
[01:45:13.359 --> 01:45:13.599]  That's right.
[01:45:13.619 --> 01:45:19.580]  For those that don't know, having one of the big three or four social media companies is a private NSA.
[01:45:21.041 --> 01:45:21.581]  Absolutely.
[01:45:22.021 --> 01:45:25.001]  And in some instances, when you have Jim Baker, right?
[01:45:25.462 --> 01:45:29.342]  The former deputy general counsel of the Twitter 1.0.
[01:45:29.762 --> 01:45:32.043]  Before that, he was the FBI senior lawyer.
[01:45:32.683 --> 01:45:34.103]  I wonder what Elon has.
[01:45:34.663 --> 01:45:35.304]  He has everything.
[01:45:35.984 --> 01:45:38.464]  That's why I've said, like you said in the last year, he needs to release it all.
[01:45:39.084 --> 01:45:41.745]  I think Elon's as big a target as Trump.
[01:45:42.768 --> 01:45:43.648]  I think bigger right now.
[01:45:43.768 --> 01:45:51.551]  I think Elon, and I've said this for a couple weeks now, Elon and Ken Paxton are the dynamic duo that's going to create the domino to save this country.
[01:45:51.811 --> 01:45:59.693]  Let's do five more minutes ahead of our next guest joining us, investigative journalist Nathan Dierman from Australia with a lot of really key reports he's putting out.
[01:46:00.313 --> 01:46:03.294]  And then we have Ian Carroll coming on with us tomorrow while that guy's on fire.
[01:46:03.715 --> 01:46:03.895]  Yeah.
[01:46:04.115 --> 01:46:05.035]  Ivan, how do people find you?
[01:46:05.535 --> 01:46:07.696]  I'm on X, Ivan Raiklen, and on Rumble.
[01:46:08.786 --> 01:46:19.855]  All right, well, quantify what you're talking about, Texas being, it already is the beachhead, as well as Florida, and where all this is going into the future and how we take the republic back and literally save the future.
[01:46:19.895 --> 01:46:20.455]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:20.656 --> 01:46:25.239]  The United States is like one of the top or most sick countries in the world.
[01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:26.801]  We spend more than anybody else per capita.
[01:46:27.461 --> 01:46:32.405]  All I have discovered that I can do is try to get things into the hands of patients as much as possible.
[01:46:32.425 --> 01:46:34.968]  That includes medication, that includes information, that includes awareness.
[01:46:48.619 --> 01:46:51.981]  And we have to help people navigate the system.
[01:46:53.202 --> 01:46:58.544]  Unfortunately, Alex, I think where it's going to go is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[01:46:59.005 --> 01:47:01.246]  Explain what the wellness company does.
[01:47:02.006 --> 01:47:04.908]  And again, it's a lot bigger than just COVID or monkeypox.
[01:47:05.268 --> 01:47:06.969]  I mean, you're talking about a, you know,
[01:47:07.549 --> 01:47:11.672]  People, I think, are fearful of getting healthcare because it's going to be terribly expensive.
[01:47:32.348 --> 01:47:38.952]  The reality is you can deliver health care for the vast majority of your needs extremely effectively.
[01:47:39.292 --> 01:47:40.133]  We can do it.
[01:47:40.233 --> 01:47:41.974]  We can get cost-effective.
[01:47:41.994 --> 01:47:43.375]  We can get medication in your hands.
[01:47:43.695 --> 01:47:49.758]  What you guys are doing is getting people directly in touch with doctors, nurses, practitioners, and others and everything that they need.
[01:47:50.078 --> 01:47:53.680]  That's why I'm so excited about the wellness company and onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:47:53.861 --> 01:47:57.162]  Everybody needs to mark that down and get ahead of this in these uncertain times.
[01:47:57.403 --> 01:47:58.003]  If you don't
[01:47:58.223 --> 01:47:58.704]  All right.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:25.367]  Going and signing for a World Health Organization so-called treaty to give them fiat authority over duly elected officials, that to me is the scariest, most evil idea I've ever heard.
[01:48:25.808 --> 01:48:32.692]  Your most effective unit is right back to you, your family, and somebody whom you contact to use their judgment to help you.
[01:48:32.992 --> 01:48:34.994]  Link to use is onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:48:35.074 --> 01:48:37.036]  One word, onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:48:37.076 --> 01:48:37.777]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:48:37.797 --> 01:48:38.818]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[01:48:38.858 --> 01:48:39.298]  Thank you so much.
[01:48:39.599 --> 01:48:40.760]  Well, that was a great interview.
[01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:45.004]  And again, he's one of the most prominent doctors in the world.
[01:48:45.905 --> 01:48:52.131]  And you could say, you know, kind of more mainline or whatever, but even he has come a long way and he's been standing up for free speech.
[01:48:52.532 --> 01:48:54.193]  And so the Wellness Company are awesome folks.
[01:48:54.213 --> 01:48:55.094]  They're a huge sponsor.
[01:48:55.374 --> 01:48:55.875]  These folks,
[01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:56.475]  Alright, so...
[01:49:22.432 --> 01:49:22.992]  You brought me a shirt?
[01:49:23.653 --> 01:49:24.133]  Oh, thank you.
[01:49:25.173 --> 01:49:29.616]  I've regularly host this last five minutes with your Trump speaker idea that I know got very close.
[01:49:29.636 --> 01:49:30.256]  People don't know that.
[01:49:30.276 --> 01:49:32.937]  You're going to break some, break some news here.
[01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:34.298]  A deep state marauder.
[01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:35.198]  That's what you're known as.
[01:49:35.639 --> 01:49:38.420]  And by the way, you're basically living up on Capitol Hill.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.242]  And so there's this Trump speakership thing in the interim, in the 76 days.
[01:49:43.262 --> 01:49:44.243]  Now you've got my attention.
[01:49:44.623 --> 01:49:48.025]  You're telling me it came very close to him being the speaker when McCarthy left already.
[01:49:48.365 --> 01:49:49.946]  So quantify and explain this to people.
[01:49:49.986 --> 01:49:50.186]  Go ahead.
[01:49:50.546 --> 01:50:07.761]  Yeah, so back the first time when we were discussing the Speaker Trump play and Matt Gaetz actually nominated him back in the first go, we were, I was talking to an individual, I'm not going to, I don't want to disclose the name of the individual within the campaign, high level, and they were communicating with President Trump the actual play of him becoming the Speaker of the House.
[01:50:08.122 --> 01:50:17.250]  Initially, they didn't quite understand the power and the influence, but we got to a point where after I think the 15th vote, I kind of explained exactly how that would look like for a temporary speakership.
[01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:18.170]  I don't know.
[01:50:36.793 --> 01:50:40.695]  Is the security detail that's directed by his political enemy, right?
[01:50:41.215 --> 01:50:44.877]  DHS Mayorkas, who's the guy letting in 10-15 million illegals.
[01:50:45.377 --> 01:51:03.845]  So the only way outside of the campaign expending all of its resources to protect Donald Trump that I see legally constitutionally is for somebody like a Bob Goode or even the new House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris to go ahead and file a motion to vacate good old Speaker Johnson and then hold a vote nominating
[01:51:04.844 --> 01:51:05.244]  Candidate
[01:51:35.244 --> 01:51:50.631]  Vote it on it would be very nice for a speaker Trump to go on offense and be the matador if you will proverbially of The deep state and I brought this little flag here to kind of showcase what that would look like.
[01:51:50.691 --> 01:51:51.551]  I don't know Alex.
[01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:52.252]  Where are you at?
[01:51:54.653 --> 01:52:01.836]  Let's go deep state So that's the idea that I'm thinking of is for us to go ahead and
[01:52:03.865 --> 01:52:05.907]  Create that framework, and here's what it does.
[01:52:07.147 --> 01:52:11.010]  If a person that's a Republican in the U.S.
[01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:25.241]  House votes to not support a Speaker Trump, that means that they're indirectly supporting his assassination, because they're voting to not allow him to have a security detail that he gets to control that he trusts.
[01:52:25.501 --> 01:52:26.222]  No, it's a great idea.
[01:52:26.262 --> 01:52:27.203]  Show us his flag again.
[01:52:27.223 --> 01:52:29.945]  That's great.
[01:52:31.448 --> 01:52:32.309]  That's for you, baby.
[01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.989]  Really?
[01:52:33.029 --> 01:52:33.249]  Yeah.
[01:52:33.289 --> 01:52:33.889]  Who made this?
[01:52:34.630 --> 01:52:39.233]  I got it as a gift from Patriots up in Portland, Oregon.
[01:52:39.253 --> 01:52:40.693]  I'm going to give them a shout out.
[01:52:40.894 --> 01:52:42.014]  This is going on my wall.
[01:52:44.015 --> 01:52:51.059]  So at the bottom it says, El Matador by J-Mac.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.541]  Instead of Matador, it's Magador.
[01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:56.082]  I'm hanging on the wall.
[01:52:57.323 --> 01:52:57.823]  I love it.
[01:52:59.344 --> 01:53:00.485]  So that's the idea behind it.
[01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:02.330]  We'll put it out.
[01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:05.691]  We're going to put this out on X. It's out live right now, but what's the headline?
[01:53:08.072 --> 01:53:12.994]  Republican Congress seriously considering Trump for speakership when he's president-elect.
[01:53:14.274 --> 01:53:16.615]  No, it can be done literally today if they decide it.
[01:53:16.655 --> 01:53:18.055]  Remember what Matt Gaetz did?
[01:53:18.395 --> 01:53:23.097]  He files a motion to vacate, they remove Johnson, and then they have to nominate another speaker.
[01:53:23.117 --> 01:53:26.178]  So the headline is Republicans considering making Trump speaker.
[01:53:27.496 --> 01:53:34.160]  In order to provide him security that Majorca... But even more importantly, they're talking about removing Biden somehow to make her the president as a stunt first.
[01:53:35.361 --> 01:53:36.601]  And Roger's really worried about that.
[01:53:36.641 --> 01:53:42.204]  That's another angle, is Democrats plan to remove Biden to make her the president, make Trump the speaker.
[01:53:42.965 --> 01:53:44.025]  So he gets security.
[01:53:44.566 --> 01:53:46.146]  Go in there, because I got another guest coming up.
[01:53:46.167 --> 01:53:46.747]  Great having you here.
[01:53:47.127 --> 01:53:49.488]  Come up with a great headline for the crew, or I'll do it after.
[01:53:49.528 --> 01:53:50.429]  But this is a big video.
[01:53:50.449 --> 01:53:51.990]  We need a big idea.
[01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.950]  So, you're right.
[01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.751]  Provides him security.
[01:53:54.671 --> 01:53:55.732]  Ivan Regula, thank you very much.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:05.983]  All right, we'll be right back with an investigative journalist from Australia, then Kirk Elliott pops in at the end on the Fed rate announcement that reportedly is happening right now.
[01:54:06.483 --> 01:54:07.964]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:54:08.244 --> 01:54:11.305]  Kyle Rittenhouse took some TurboForce yesterday.
[01:54:11.425 --> 01:54:17.027]  It sold out, but the liquid version, even more powerful, TurboForce Ultra.
[01:54:17.767 --> 01:54:23.269]  UltraForce is available at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds the operation.
[01:54:24.485 --> 01:54:25.586]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:26.527 --> 01:54:30.231]  BrainForce Ultra is TurboForce Ultra.
[01:54:31.272 --> 01:54:33.053]  Available now at m4warstore.com.
[01:54:33.093 --> 01:54:34.615]  And if funds the M4, you'll love it.
[01:54:34.635 --> 01:54:35.436]  Here's Carl Rittenhouse.
[01:54:37.173 --> 01:54:45.279]  Alright, folks, I did not intend for this plug, but Kyle Rittenhouse was just here, and Harrison gave him some Rainforce about an hour ago, and he wanted to say something about it, so why not?
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:49.803]  Yeah, I was sitting here, uh, you went to the bathroom on break, and I was like, I'm gonna try some of these.
[01:54:50.143 --> 01:54:53.646]  Took two of them, and, wow, am I awake, but it's clean energy.
[01:54:54.046 --> 01:54:57.769]  I'm not, like, jittery or anxious or sweating.
[01:54:57.969 --> 01:54:58.750]  I'm just awake.
[01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:00.391]  We're not gonna give it to the dog, are we?
[01:55:00.851 --> 01:55:02.272]  We're not gonna give Milo any.
[01:55:02.813 --> 01:55:04.154]  I don't know if that would be good for him.
[01:55:04.727 --> 01:55:07.590]  Brother, tell us of the group you're working with in Texas as their outreach coordinator.
[01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:10.392]  Yeah, I'm the outreach director for Texas Gun Rights.
[01:55:10.432 --> 01:55:13.515]  We're the largest no-compromise gun rights group in the state of Texas.
[01:55:13.575 --> 01:55:14.316]  And they find them where?
[01:55:14.656 --> 01:55:16.658]  You can find them at texasgunrights.org.
[01:55:16.698 --> 01:55:18.299]  Alright, very exciting, brother.
[01:55:18.499 --> 01:55:19.200]  So good to see you.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:19.881]  Thanks for coming in.
[01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:20.681]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:20.922 --> 01:55:22.583]  Alright, and thank you, Milo.
[01:55:24.485 --> 01:55:25.285]  What a good dog.
[01:55:25.365 --> 01:55:25.966]  Alright, folks.
[01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:33.189]  You can find BrainForce at infowarestore.com and BrainForce Ultra and TurboForce coming back in stock.
[01:55:33.429 --> 01:55:34.649]  Carl Rittenhouse, thank you so much, brother.
[01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:35.310]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.750]  God bless.
[01:55:36.110 --> 01:55:39.251]  Come have a look at what I just found on Carmella Harris' Instagram.
[01:55:39.532 --> 01:55:44.054]  If you go through the people she follows, you'll find something very, very strange.
[01:55:44.234 --> 01:55:49.016]  Pretty much all of them are either actors, celebrities, athletes, or political figures.
[01:55:49.216 --> 01:55:52.317]  But then you'll find someone called John Doerr.
[01:55:52.437 --> 01:55:53.898]  So I did some digging on John.
[01:55:54.478 --> 01:55:56.440]  You're not gonna believe what I found.
[01:55:56.741 --> 01:56:03.567]  We know Camilla's flip-flopped on policy, but let me tell you, Big Johnny makes it pretty clear what the agenda is.
[01:56:03.767 --> 01:56:10.334]  Besides the traceable donations to the Dems, let me lay out why I think he could be one of the puppet masters behind their agenda.
[01:56:10.674 --> 01:56:25.271]  He's on the board of a number of key companies, the first of which is Google, which we now know has been extremely active in censorship, most recently when they stifled the viewership of the attempted Trump assassination and only showed Carmella search results when you'd search for Trump.
[01:56:25.691 --> 01:56:31.394]  He was also an early investor in Twitter, and very active in the decision-making during Jack Dorsey's ownership.
[01:56:32.094 --> 01:56:42.980]  He's a part of Bono's one organization, Bill Gates' The Pledge, but the most crazy involvement has to be Forward.us, which he co-founded alongside Zuckerberg.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:49.683]  It's essentially aimed at fast-tracking citizenship for immigrants in the US, and some of the rhetoric is quite alarming.
[01:56:49.703 --> 01:56:51.544]  I mean, look at this.
[01:57:04.335 --> 01:57:22.567]  I've been on air 30 years, and I'm seeing a crop of investigative journalists, citizen journalists, and activists and researchers that is, wait for it, hundreds of times bigger than all the patriots I've known and all the fighting we've done in 30 years.
[01:57:24.008 --> 01:57:27.951]  And I was in the first big wave coming into digital media, first on terrestrial radio.
[01:57:27.971 --> 01:57:32.193]  There were all these great old timers doing conferences and writing books and newsletters, and they were the experts.
[01:57:32.213 --> 01:57:32.974]  They were right about everything.
[01:57:34.307 --> 01:57:34.767]  Incredible.
[01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.809]  And Ronald Reagan was in those groups, everything.
[01:57:37.829 --> 01:57:39.911]  When he was governor, he knew all about the New World Order.
[01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:49.637]  And Ron Paul, and of course, Cleon Skousen, and the list goes on and on of great people.
[01:57:49.677 --> 01:57:54.000]  Ted Gunderson, G. Edward Griffin, Anthony Sutton.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:02.305]  But now, I mean, I can't even keep track of the people doing hardcore research and just devastating the globalist every day.
[01:58:03.268 --> 01:58:04.550]  We got Ian Carroll on tomorrow.
[01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.415]  Nathan Derriman is in Australia.
[01:58:08.577 --> 01:58:10.320]  He is really a successful guy.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.542]  I'm going to go over his whole bio.
[01:58:12.503 --> 01:58:14.346]  But he got pissed off.
[01:58:15.606 --> 01:58:18.028]  He's already awake when the COVID lockdowns happened there.
[01:58:18.349 --> 01:58:19.009]  Outraged by the U.S.
[01:58:19.049 --> 01:58:21.251]  election in the first week of 2020, the events of COVID.
[01:58:21.271 --> 01:58:24.294]  He was determined to give credence to his instincts on important issues.
[01:58:25.315 --> 01:58:31.181]  And following the money trail, he knows all too well how Wall Street has begun rigging against the masses worldwide.
[01:58:31.201 --> 01:58:33.643]  It's the same globalist who co-founded Cashew.
[01:58:34.364 --> 01:58:38.725]  Which aims to give everyday Americans access to the same trading algorithms hedge funds use.
[01:58:38.965 --> 01:58:39.605]  It's exploded.
[01:58:40.185 --> 01:58:48.307]  Nate uses and joins us today after his viral Kamala Harris video, which have gotten millions of views across Hex Instagram the past few weeks.
[01:58:48.748 --> 01:58:50.868]  You just saw the beginning of that video.
[01:58:50.888 --> 01:58:54.129]  We'll put it on screen from his Hex account and Instagram.
[01:58:54.529 --> 01:58:57.810]  He's Cashunate, one word, C-A-S-H-U, Nate.
[01:58:58.530 --> 01:59:00.155]  And we're extremely honored to have him.
[01:59:00.175 --> 01:59:04.769]  I'm glad he came on in just a few days of us contacting him because...
[01:59:06.226 --> 01:59:06.907]  Let me tell you something.
[01:59:06.927 --> 01:59:16.675]  There's a lot of talented, smart people out there, and in the old days, the Rush Limbaugh's and the Glenn Beck's, and Beck even said this when I was on with him last week, it was all very competitive, and other hosts were this and that.
[01:59:16.695 --> 01:59:17.395]  I've never been like that.
[01:59:17.615 --> 01:59:19.217]  I want to become obsolete.
[01:59:19.377 --> 01:59:28.344]  I want all these great men and women from around the world to wake up with a new world order, to know they've got to take action, kick ass, and they're doing it, and the growth curve and the knowledge is so incredible.
[01:59:28.384 --> 01:59:29.885]  These guys are coming out of the gates.
[01:59:30.786 --> 01:59:34.288]  And are just doing incredible, powerful reports.
[01:59:34.328 --> 01:59:35.389]  And there's so many!
[01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:38.811]  And it's my job to bring you these people if you don't know who they are.
[01:59:39.172 --> 01:59:41.053]  You'll learn about them sooner or later because they're exploding.
[01:59:41.393 --> 01:59:42.214]  But there are hundreds.
[01:59:42.434 --> 01:59:43.555]  My head is spinning.
[01:59:43.995 --> 01:59:49.739]  Men, women, old, young, black, white, in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, in the Middle East, in Europe.
[01:59:50.578 --> 01:59:53.101]  This is such an exciting time to be alive.
[01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:55.624]  So, Nathan Diererman, we salute you.
[01:59:55.644 --> 01:59:56.966]  We got you for about 40 minutes.
[01:59:57.747 --> 02:00:00.930]  Then we've got an update on the Fed rate announcement we'll get to.
[02:00:01.591 --> 02:00:04.334]  But, Nathan, wow, your Kamala video, all of it.
[02:00:04.354 --> 02:00:05.315]  But let's start with...
[02:00:05.836 --> 02:00:10.380]  You're already a smart guy, you're already a successful businessman, and you've got a great broadcaster voice.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.981]  I love the Aussie voice, but yours is amazing.
[02:00:12.001 --> 02:00:15.104]  I'll tell you, I want you to do some liners for us, or cut some of our ads.
[02:00:15.364 --> 02:00:16.425]  I can't stop listening to your voice.
[02:00:16.765 --> 02:00:17.966]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:18.027 --> 02:00:22.050]  No, you're strong, we're strong, we're fighting the same enemy.
[02:00:22.410 --> 02:00:23.651]  So congratulations on all you're doing.
[02:00:24.112 --> 02:00:28.315]  Tell us about your decision to take action when you're in
[02:00:29.236 --> 02:00:38.521]  Australia which has turned back into a penal colony and many people are saying and the incredible tyranny you're under and the beta test is for all of us and then where we are today and your viral reports.
[02:00:40.122 --> 02:00:57.572]  Absolutely and firstly I'd just like to extend the warmest of thanks for having me on like you've been a big inspiration over the years and I was talking among my mates yesterday about how when I was in the playground in high school I used to watch your videos and love the alien stuff.
[02:00:59.224 --> 02:01:07.010]  I absolutely love your globalist agenda videos and I was always laughed at by my mates and they're like, nah, you're fucking crazy.
[02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:08.531]  Am I allowed to swear?
[02:01:08.631 --> 02:01:08.931]  Sorry.
[02:01:10.753 --> 02:01:22.481]  And it's great now being in a position where we see all these things come to fruition and the instinct that I had all along was sort of right and founded in truth.
[02:01:24.517 --> 02:01:34.381]  Yeah, more recently, what inspired me to dive deep into this was particularly around the 2020 election and the events of COVID.
[02:01:34.581 --> 02:01:42.305]  I think for a lot of people here, you referenced it before, the penal colony sort of vibe that we have now in Australia.
[02:01:43.906 --> 02:01:52.689]  I think, look, we've levelled out since COVID, but it was extremely tumultuous during that period.
[02:01:54.637 --> 02:02:01.419]  A lot of people just rolled over and accepted defeat and accepted control.
[02:02:01.679 --> 02:02:10.843]  We had really handsome handouts from the government, weekly payments, which were famously called SCOMO payments under the Scott Morrison government.
[02:02:11.983 --> 02:02:16.204]  And I just knew that it wasn't right.
[02:02:16.965 --> 02:02:23.367]  And that was back from my instinct as a young lad as well and being a bit more curious than everyone else in the playground.
[02:02:24.421 --> 02:02:27.246]  And that was when I decided to take action.
[02:02:27.266 --> 02:02:33.936]  So sort of early 2021, I started creating short form business videos, which did quite well.
[02:02:33.956 --> 02:02:38.082]  I started to talk about business stories more close to home.
[02:02:39.807 --> 02:02:41.248]  And then expanded into the US.
[02:02:41.268 --> 02:02:49.212]  But then I started to get a lot more traction when I dove into US-based politics and also domestic politics here.
[02:02:49.892 --> 02:02:55.375]  As you know very well, we're basically just a baby brother of yours and a satellite state.
[02:02:55.475 --> 02:02:59.837]  So whatever the agenda is over there, in a lot of respects, we follow here.
[02:02:59.917 --> 02:03:06.820]  So yeah, it just pushed me to go all in.
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:08.221]  Because as you know all too well,
[02:03:09.093 --> 02:03:15.975]  It takes a lot of courage to put your face and put your thoughts out there for the world to digest.
[02:03:16.235 --> 02:03:30.918]  You know, you've been doing it for 30 years and you've been absolutely killing it and been an inspiration for, as you mentioned at the top of the call, all these new investigative journalists that are coming out of the woodworks and finding their voice.
[02:03:33.012 --> 02:03:51.730]  You're a big part of the reason that's... Well, brother, I appreciate that, but the reason it's so important is they're passing laws in Australia, they're passing laws in New Zealand, they're passing laws in the EU, they're passing laws in the UK, Canada, the US to literally outlaw basic speech or put people in prison here for it, like Doug Mackey making a meme.
[02:03:52.170 --> 02:03:53.191]  That's a beta test.
[02:03:53.271 --> 02:03:55.794]  And so, but they can't get us if there's
[02:03:56.374 --> 02:04:01.658]  Tens of thousands of giant prominent people, millions of somewhat prominent, hundreds of millions of active people.
[02:04:02.118 --> 02:04:02.738]  It's game over.
[02:04:02.818 --> 02:04:03.979]  We're watching them.
[02:04:04.039 --> 02:04:04.840]  We're tracking them.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:07.221]  I mean, you reach millions a day.
[02:04:07.301 --> 02:04:08.882]  You're bigger than the average CNN show.
[02:04:09.463 --> 02:04:11.284]  My show reaches more than all CNN today.
[02:04:11.364 --> 02:04:12.305]  Joe Rogan three or four times.
[02:04:12.345 --> 02:04:14.006]  Tucker Carlson two or three times.
[02:04:14.026 --> 02:04:14.446]  Glenn Beck.
[02:04:14.486 --> 02:04:15.667]  It goes on and on.
[02:04:16.187 --> 02:04:17.028]  This is a war.
[02:04:17.748 --> 02:04:20.390]  And we're telling the truth and we're getting it out.
[02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:24.312]  So it's about overriding their tyranny and their strength in numbers.
[02:04:24.332 --> 02:04:25.033]  That's why we're together.
[02:04:25.313 --> 02:04:29.316]  So looking at the world today, seeing what's happening, how would you, and you said somebody else really key.
[02:04:31.542 --> 02:04:36.105]  Everything I talked about 30 years ago off their own documents wasn't me guessing and I wasn't psychic.
[02:04:36.606 --> 02:04:38.927]  We're all a little psychic, but it wasn't psychic power doing that.
[02:04:39.928 --> 02:04:40.829]  They've basically done it.
[02:04:40.849 --> 02:04:45.372]  So it means the other horrible stuff they want to do, bring us down to 500 million people, they're going to try that.
[02:04:45.772 --> 02:04:47.133]  Elon Musk is saying they're exterminists.
[02:04:47.153 --> 02:04:47.773]  They're a death cult.
[02:04:47.793 --> 02:04:48.694]  He's on our team.
[02:04:48.734 --> 02:04:50.235]  So this is really the choice.
[02:04:50.295 --> 02:04:50.856]  We're here.
[02:04:51.576 --> 02:04:51.816]  Absolutely.
[02:04:51.836 --> 02:04:54.277]  And look, yeah, more pertinently to the point as you just touched on, I
[02:05:14.824 --> 02:05:20.568]  I think the consciousness, I say a lot, that the public consciousness is rising like we've never seen before.
[02:05:20.948 --> 02:05:24.210]  And that speaks to the point you're making there, and I couldn't agree more.
[02:05:25.391 --> 02:05:26.472]  It's caught them off guard.
[02:05:26.652 --> 02:05:31.635]  And I often surmise that COVID was their fatal mistake.
[02:05:32.415 --> 02:05:34.797]  It let the genie out of the bottle, so to speak.
[02:05:35.517 --> 02:05:42.322]  And whilst they've created these information weapons, as Elon likes to call it, sort of the
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:50.906]  The megaphone, the technology megaphone, which is their catch-22, is the way I see it.
[02:05:50.966 --> 02:06:03.395]  Yeah, it's extremely destructive, but at the same time it's allowed this information proliferation to occur that we both lean on every day to reach millions of people.
[02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:08.019]  And as you just said, and I completely agree, it seems
[02:06:08.942 --> 02:06:10.982]  Quite strongly that we're winning the fight.
[02:06:11.303 --> 02:06:12.123]  And they're panicking.
[02:06:13.123 --> 02:06:14.743]  Which is fantastic to see.
[02:06:14.843 --> 02:06:16.764]  It's almost like this scrambling effect.
[02:06:17.604 --> 02:06:20.424]  So, yeah, I couldn't agree more on that point.
[02:06:20.645 --> 02:06:22.825]  And it's very, very empowering to see that.
[02:06:23.885 --> 02:06:26.446]  More specifically to the US elections as well.
[02:06:27.286 --> 02:06:29.706]  And tying that to what's going on here.
[02:06:31.547 --> 02:06:32.187]  It's paramount.
[02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:34.020]  You know, we saw what happened in 2020.
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.762]  I was lambasted for saying that it was rigged and they cheated.
[02:06:38.022 --> 02:06:39.583]  I mean, I watched it in real time.
[02:06:39.723 --> 02:06:41.965]  I knew straight away something was wrong.
[02:06:43.266 --> 02:06:48.249]  And sure enough, it's taken a while for all of it to come out.
[02:06:48.469 --> 02:07:00.696]  But it's pretty unequivocal, through really strong journalism, that documentary piece, I can't remember the exact name, the mules on the mail run, the mail runs... 2000 mules.
[02:07:02.327 --> 02:07:02.807]  That's the one.
[02:07:02.847 --> 02:07:04.228]  Yeah, great investigative piece.
[02:07:04.888 --> 02:07:06.008]  There's so much out there now.
[02:07:06.028 --> 02:07:24.496]  And then you've got Zuckerberg coming out the other week and literally admitting that he was forced to hand over autonomy over censorship on his platforms to the big military industrial complex agencies you've got over there.
[02:07:24.516 --> 02:07:25.776]  So for me,
[02:07:28.143 --> 02:07:39.650]  Here in Australia, it's paramount that this election goes the right way to Trump because we have, more close to home, I sent you a couple of dot points on it.
[02:07:39.690 --> 02:07:44.393]  I'd like to talk a little bit about what's happened here under the E-Safety Commission.
[02:07:45.553 --> 02:07:51.697]  And this was a commission set up in 2015, which is really just your archetypal
[02:07:52.543 --> 02:07:55.404]  censorship industrial complex set up.
[02:07:55.564 --> 02:07:57.185]  And people say, why do we care about Australia?
[02:07:57.285 --> 02:07:58.165]  Well, they're good people.
[02:07:59.005 --> 02:08:07.709]  But also, Klaus Schwab and the UN admit Australia is the main testing ground, along with New Zealand, with Jacinda Ardern saying, don't look at the sunset, don't talk to your neighbors.
[02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:09.149]  We're your only source of info.
[02:08:09.509 --> 02:08:13.011]  They've been calling for arresting Elon Musk in the government chambers.
[02:08:13.031 --> 02:08:17.112]  So people understand, this is where the enemy is trying to beta test.
[02:08:17.192 --> 02:08:17.813]  It's so key.
[02:08:18.273 --> 02:08:18.893]  Tell people about it.
[02:08:20.143 --> 02:08:34.257]  Yes, so we'll go into that now and beta test is a great way to put it because, so this was set up in 2015 and this is more specifically speaking to censorship and misinformation and disinformation, so to speak.
[02:08:36.323 --> 02:08:41.746]  And this is headed by a lady called Julie Inman Grant, and she's from the US.
[02:08:42.406 --> 02:08:48.689]  They appointed her in 2021 after the Online Safety Act was passed.
[02:08:48.869 --> 02:08:50.170]  So this was during COVID.
[02:08:50.971 --> 02:08:57.254]  And she's got one of the, and I'm not sure if you've heard of her, Alex, but she has a pretty crazy resume.
[02:08:58.474 --> 02:09:03.637]  She worked at Twitter under Dorsey in safety in philanthropy.
[02:09:04.418 --> 02:09:06.099]  in safety and philanthropy.
[02:09:06.239 --> 02:09:11.882]  She worked with the World Economic Forum in digital safety and defining the metaverse.
[02:09:11.922 --> 02:09:12.642]  She still does.
[02:09:13.383 --> 02:09:17.004]  She worked on Biden's White House Gender Affirming Council.
[02:09:18.005 --> 02:09:20.046]  She worked at Microsoft for 17 years.
[02:09:21.407 --> 02:09:31.732]  And now she heads our e-safety commission, which essentially dictates what is and isn't misinformation online.
[02:09:32.367 --> 02:09:40.073]  Now, our party's over here, so in power at the moment is the Labor government, which would be seen essentially as the Democrats over there.
[02:09:41.014 --> 02:09:48.459]  There's been little resistance from the coalition, so the Liberals, to this until recent weeks.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:52.022]  But she's already fined Elon.
[02:09:52.282 --> 02:09:55.244]  She fined him late last year for $600,000 for hate speech and
[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:11.659]  They tried to link it towards child pornography issues, but it was definitely more sinister than that in terms of the actual front.
[02:10:11.679 --> 02:10:13.100]  They used that as a mirage.
[02:10:14.161 --> 02:10:16.542]  So this is what we're up against.
[02:10:16.643 --> 02:10:23.628]  And the scariest part of all this is this woman who is definitely sort of the archetypal spawn of the censorship industrial complex.
[02:10:24.088 --> 02:10:25.249]  And she's not even ours.
[02:10:25.649 --> 02:10:29.112]  She doesn't even have Australia's best interests at heart, clearly.
[02:10:31.331 --> 02:10:36.894]  has full autonomy over dictating what is and isn't misinformation.
[02:10:37.875 --> 02:10:43.778]  So, I posed the question in a piece I did on it last year, and I posed the question again.
[02:10:43.918 --> 02:10:49.901]  Do we really want someone like this dictating what we can and can't say online?
[02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:51.282]  I think the answer is obvious.
[02:10:51.342 --> 02:10:54.644]  And unlike the US, we don't have
[02:10:55.473 --> 02:10:57.995]  an inalienable right to free speech here.
[02:10:58.355 --> 02:11:10.222]  You know, there's murky sort of freedom of expression insinuations within our constitution, but there's nothing that really protects us like you guys have.
[02:11:10.322 --> 02:11:12.684]  So it is all very, very scary.
[02:11:13.745 --> 02:11:15.726]  And you're spot on.
[02:11:15.826 --> 02:11:18.428]  It seems like we had the harshest lockdowns.
[02:11:18.488 --> 02:11:21.910]  We've already been enforcing some crazy censorship fines.
[02:11:22.768 --> 02:11:29.732]  It seems very much like we are sort of this beta test satellite state at the bottom of the earth.
[02:11:30.412 --> 02:11:39.658]  Well the WF has said COVID was a test for worldwide martial law and environmental carbon tax lockdowns and they've said Australia
[02:11:40.805 --> 02:11:46.911]  Swab said Australia, New Zealand, and places Italy and the UK were the main testing grounds.
[02:11:47.572 --> 02:11:52.017]  And remember Trudeau threw a bunch of people in prison for peacefully protesting after two years of lockdowns in Canada.
[02:11:52.057 --> 02:11:52.978]  These are monsters.
[02:11:53.018 --> 02:11:54.980]  He says, what do you admire most, Trudeau?
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:58.003]  I admire the basic dictatorship of Xi Jinping.
[02:11:58.023 --> 02:12:00.545]  I mean, they're saying the quiet part out loud.
[02:12:00.565 --> 02:12:03.929]  Have you seen Hillary say she wants to arrest people for memes?
[02:12:04.824 --> 02:12:10.346]  I saw that this week, exactly, which is why it's so timely to bring this up because, you know, there's no coincidences.
[02:12:10.987 --> 02:12:15.068]  It could be any day now that this Julie Inman rant starts pulling the trigger again.
[02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:16.509]  She's already started.
[02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:19.090]  Didn't they without passing laws, just regulations?
[02:12:20.491 --> 02:12:27.894]  Yes, so the misinformation bill has been, it got pulled together late last year.
[02:12:29.117 --> 02:12:37.551]  And it went through Parliament two weeks ago, but got thrown out by the Coalition and the other constituents.
[02:12:37.731 --> 02:12:41.937]  But just this week, I believe, it's now resurfaced.
[02:12:42.851 --> 02:12:54.015]  They're going to keep pushing as hard as they possibly can to push this bill through, which would give even more powers to the E-Safety Commission and just generally the censorship industrial complex.
[02:12:54.055 --> 02:13:01.178]  Well, I was reading they would break into anybody's social media or their devices and pose as them and commit crimes and then charge you.
[02:13:01.238 --> 02:13:02.999]  This was mainstream news over there reporting this.
[02:13:03.419 --> 02:13:07.640]  The most tyrannical secret police crap that would make the Stasi in East Germany blush.
[02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:08.781]  They're just saying it like it's no big deal.
[02:13:10.194 --> 02:13:11.595]  100%.
[02:13:10.994 --> 02:13:11.595]  100%.
[02:13:11.215 --> 02:13:11.595]  Spot on.
[02:13:11.995 --> 02:13:14.658]  So look, it's absolutely frightening.
[02:13:15.459 --> 02:13:24.208]  So it's paramount, back to the US, it is paramount that we have this paradigm shift and we move towards obliterating the deep state because
[02:13:25.638 --> 02:13:46.802]  The tentacles run far, far and wide and it's quite often easy for the masses to overlook little old Australia down here because it's all so seemingly well, small population, no crime, clean streets, clean cities, not much homelessness, good employment rates, inflation's rife, but it's easy to forget that.
[02:13:46.882 --> 02:13:53.084]  So, you know, I like to use a lot of these more global orientated stories to
[02:13:55.382 --> 02:14:02.227]  Be positioned as emblems for what's going on at home as well, because it's harder for the masses to kind of draw those connections.
[02:14:03.749 --> 02:14:09.673]  Yeah, and I think that trickles into what they're doing with the finance, the financial system as well.
[02:14:10.634 --> 02:14:12.235]  And you had a guest on earlier.
[02:14:12.255 --> 02:14:13.796]  I don't want to butcher his name.
[02:14:13.836 --> 02:14:14.757]  I was listening before.
[02:14:14.897 --> 02:14:15.818]  Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:18.880]  No, Ivan.
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:19.681]  Ivan Reikland.
[02:14:20.509 --> 02:14:21.290]  Yes, yes.
[02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:25.894]  And he was talking about the gold accumulation and what the central banks are doing.
[02:14:25.914 --> 02:14:37.065]  And yeah, when you start to tie all the layers together, which most people don't, you know, people get stuck in the corporatocracy aspect and the government aspect.
[02:14:37.145 --> 02:14:42.871]  And they don't look beyond that to what the banks are doing and the financial system
[02:14:44.224 --> 02:14:47.867]  You know, that's when you can piece it all together, you really, really do see the big picture.
[02:14:47.887 --> 02:14:50.809]  Give us your boil down on that, because I know you post a lot of really good reports on that.
[02:14:50.849 --> 02:15:00.557]  How would you describe the central banks are creating inflation for the general public while vertically integrating culture and society themselves, while promoting communism and helping poor people.
[02:15:00.597 --> 02:15:09.644]  We've seen the biggest transfer of wealth to a very small group in history, and they're the, quote, liberal rulers of the earth who keep promising everyone milk and honey, but they're doing the opposite.
[02:15:11.912 --> 02:15:12.472]  Absolutely.
[02:15:12.732 --> 02:15:18.273]  And look, I've spent a lot of time the last probably six months diving into that aspect a bit more.
[02:15:18.513 --> 02:15:30.816]  And as you peel back the layers, you know, this gold accumulation narrative, which has been going on for the last couple of years, you see Russia and China almost tripling their gold reserves.
[02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.517]  And you start to question, oh, why is that?
[02:15:33.537 --> 02:15:40.118]  Then you see the BRICS, the BRICS just expanding by the week, Turkey joining them or wanting to join in the last couple of weeks.
[02:15:40.814 --> 02:15:44.615]  They're all moving towards or trying to undermine the U.S.
[02:15:44.655 --> 02:15:47.816]  dollar's overall influence in the global economy.
[02:15:47.876 --> 02:15:48.937]  That's the play.
[02:15:49.277 --> 02:16:09.464]  But the more sinister aspect to it all, and what's more in line with the WPF and the globalist agenda, is to obviously tie in a commodity-backed central bank digital currency that initially will probably be nation by nation.
[02:16:11.118 --> 02:16:14.279]  To then impose control upon its citizens.
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:29.146]  Everything will eventually be tokenized under CBDCs and the select few utility tokens that make it through this crypto landscape once the regulatory landscape becomes clearer.
[02:16:29.767 --> 02:16:30.788]  Nathan Derriman, stay there.
[02:16:30.808 --> 02:16:31.388]  We gotta go to break.
[02:16:31.408 --> 02:16:49.057]  Let's come back and talk about what that system will look like from their own admissions, how far away it is, how you see this unfolding, and the big wild card, war with Russia, with the announcement last week of storm shadows raining down, and now we've seen the biggest explosion yet in Russian territory.
[02:16:49.457 --> 02:16:50.158]  It's all coming up.

[02:17:50.585 --> 02:17:55.866]  Well, all the corporate media was saying the head of the private Federal Reserve would do a quarter point.
[02:17:56.306 --> 02:17:59.527]  Kirk Elliott, an hour and a half ago, predicted here on air it would be half a point.
[02:18:00.247 --> 02:18:02.288]  We are next hour's news now.
[02:18:02.968 --> 02:18:03.468]  He nailed it.
[02:18:03.488 --> 02:18:04.708]  He's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[02:18:05.208 --> 02:18:06.028]  And we have the prediction.
[02:18:07.029 --> 02:18:08.469]  Fed cuts rates by half a point.
[02:18:09.315 --> 02:18:16.060]  That's all coming up, but very impressive deep dive videos that are still quick, you know, 10 minutes long or so.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:20.923]  Nathan Derriman from the land down under had a few other key points to hit.
[02:18:20.943 --> 02:18:29.389]  We're getting the globalist financial system agenda, CBDCs, but I also wanted to get a little bit with him into war.
[02:18:30.330 --> 02:18:33.974]  Drone strike on Arsenal triggers biggest explosion on Russian soil of the war.
[02:18:34.535 --> 02:18:36.437]  The media is claiming it's a little drone.
[02:18:37.318 --> 02:18:43.064]  Was it a storm shadow which Biden said they would start launching and gave authorization to last week, last Friday?
[02:18:44.626 --> 02:18:49.371]  But it was in the news, the London Guardian said that Biden in the meeting didn't want it known the U.S.
[02:18:49.391 --> 02:18:50.012]  was doing it.
[02:18:51.098 --> 02:18:52.919]  Is that what just happened here?
[02:18:53.139 --> 02:19:05.364]  Massive escalation, also DOD plans Eastern Europe nuclear strike simulation to prepare for potential collapse of Western agriculture system in nuclear winter, because of the dust it throws up.
[02:19:06.404 --> 02:19:07.085]  Just incredible.
[02:19:07.265 --> 02:19:13.227]  So the big wild card, the Ace of Spades, war with Russia, rapidly escalating.
[02:19:13.247 --> 02:19:18.449]  Russia says if they're hit by any storm, shadows will officially be in war with NATO, the United States, the UK.
[02:19:18.829 --> 02:19:19.990]  So your take on that, Nathan?
[02:19:22.409 --> 02:19:24.710]  Yeah, look, I mean, I'll be fully transparent.
[02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:33.235]  I'm not super, super in the weeds with tracking all the war and the journalism on that front.
[02:19:33.355 --> 02:19:41.339]  However, I do stitch it together with the globalist agenda pertaining more so towards the financial system.
[02:19:41.499 --> 02:19:43.460]  I do see a world where
[02:19:44.344 --> 02:19:57.622]  This could be, much like the cyber attacks that we saw testing for a few months ago, a rapid move towards destabilization.
[02:20:00.072 --> 02:20:26.760]  Leading into the elections because obviously they're they're fretting they're panicking The deep state of you know on their heels as you talk about quite often This could be their final sort of wild card to completely destabilize the West But more specifically going back to this this financial system that could be rolled out off the back of something like that this would be very similar to what we saw during covered where a
[02:20:27.446 --> 02:20:34.835]  They were allowed to enforce the injections upon us under emergency orders.
[02:20:35.596 --> 02:20:44.146]  This could be something that they could do under a world that's destabilized under war or excessive cyber attacks.
[02:20:45.404 --> 02:20:56.190]  They'd force upon us these CBDCs, these central bank digital currencies, the digital IDs they'd come across as, well, you know, we're your saviour now.
[02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:57.671]  This is the only way forward.
[02:20:58.512 --> 02:21:03.655]  So that's kind of how I'd surmise what's happening with the war.
[02:21:03.735 --> 02:21:05.996]  It's anyone's guess exactly what will happen.
[02:21:06.936 --> 02:21:12.800]  But it's a clear tactic of the globalists to certainly
[02:21:19.125 --> 02:21:19.766]  Absolutely.
[02:21:20.887 --> 02:21:23.868]  It's just, look, the old financial system's coming to an end.
[02:21:24.108 --> 02:21:25.309]  The globalists have their big bubble.
[02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:32.033]  Now they need to get out of inflation and with a unified ledger, making us all go to a new digital system where they openly control everything.
[02:21:32.534 --> 02:21:35.676]  We will own nothing anymore, not houses, not cars, not patents.
[02:21:35.736 --> 02:21:36.816]  It'll all be put in this pool.
[02:21:37.256 --> 02:21:38.377]  We'll then be a stakeholder.
[02:21:38.417 --> 02:21:39.778]  They'll be able to do bail-ins at will.
[02:21:40.338 --> 02:21:42.500]  The FDIC admits this and just take money out of it.
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:46.002]  But they believe they can then inflate that again and people will see dividends.
[02:21:46.042 --> 02:21:50.285]  So they'll want to get involved in it, but then we'll be right back in the same slavery pattern.
[02:21:50.825 --> 02:21:55.148]  And then they'll be able to control all your activities with it and penalize you for your social activity.
[02:21:55.168 --> 02:21:57.209]  I mean, this is a nightmare scenario.
[02:21:58.850 --> 02:21:57.209]  100%.
[02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:07.316]  And that's the tokenization aspect when you start to peel back the layers and see just how much you can do with that is frightening.
[02:22:07.896 --> 02:22:10.278]  Because when they roll this system out, which
[02:22:11.414 --> 02:22:27.546]  is likely next year if they try to do it under the ISO 222 compliance system, which is sort of an international collaboration amongst the big institutions and banks to roll onto this new digital system.
[02:22:28.466 --> 02:22:33.970]  This is from ticketing as well as messaging and sending money cross-border.
[02:22:34.931 --> 02:22:35.952]  This is enforced
[02:22:36.992 --> 02:22:39.053]  from March next year.
[02:22:39.373 --> 02:22:45.476]  And if you don't roll onto it by November next year, then you're left behind.
[02:22:45.896 --> 02:22:48.857]  So this is, this is at the forefront of their mind.
[02:22:49.038 --> 02:23:00.963]  And a big part of what will happen in the tokenization sphere is the push towards tokenizing houses, businesses, carbon credits.
[02:23:01.423 --> 02:23:05.085]  You know, that's probably one of the more frightening ones is that there, there could be a world
[02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:15.257]  A world that they want where, you know, if you go, you burn too much CO2 in your air con during summer, well then that's all right.
[02:23:15.297 --> 02:23:22.962]  We've got it tokenized and we'll just deduct that from your UBI when we issue your digital currency next month.
[02:23:23.542 --> 02:23:32.488]  So people don't realize just how granular this gets and BlackRock could have sort of insinuated
[02:23:33.297 --> 02:23:38.439]  A number of times, just how keen they are to tokenize absolutely everything.
[02:23:38.459 --> 02:23:42.320]  Well, I mean, Larry Fink said at the World Economic Forum last year, he says, we will control your behavior.
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:43.420]  I mean, they've said this.
[02:23:44.521 --> 02:23:44.941]  Exactly.
[02:23:45.301 --> 02:23:53.704]  And that's, yeah, I mean, all I tell a lot of my followers and people I discuss this with is how can you sort of best position yourself?
[02:23:55.732 --> 02:23:59.155]  Whether the globalists succeed or not, and I don't think they will.
[02:23:59.175 --> 02:24:08.923]  I know I'm a man of faith and the public consciousness is rising, and as you often say, this is a battle between good, evil, God, Satan, 100%.
[02:24:11.265 --> 02:24:16.409]  I still think there will be a world, a prosperous world, when we succeed.
[02:24:17.276 --> 02:24:22.860]  That utility-based crypto does have a place.
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:29.143]  I don't know the details too much yet, but you look at what Trump's trying to launch with the Liberty thing.
[02:24:30.965 --> 02:24:34.026]  There is hope on this front.
[02:24:34.327 --> 02:24:36.828]  Well, he's promised to kill the central bank digital currency.
[02:24:37.709 --> 02:24:38.489]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:24:38.629 --> 02:24:43.232]  And I don't know the inner workings of exactly what he's proposing just yet.
[02:24:44.573 --> 02:24:45.714]  I need to catch up on all that.
[02:24:47.759 --> 02:24:53.741]  That's important to just sort of map out because people need to know that this is something we don't want.
[02:24:53.781 --> 02:24:55.462]  We don't want our speech regulated.
[02:24:55.662 --> 02:24:57.703]  We don't want our assets controlled.
[02:24:58.283 --> 02:25:01.985]  We don't want people monitoring our every bank transfer.
[02:25:04.426 --> 02:25:17.351]  It seems quite trivial but it's so easily overlooked when you're not in the weeds like us every day reading all those documents, seeing the fine print and stitching together the more
[02:25:18.731 --> 02:25:25.414]  In closing, how do people find you?
[02:25:25.434 --> 02:25:27.975]  What else would you like them to know about the great work you're doing, Nathan?
[02:25:32.208 --> 02:25:33.169]  As you said, top of the show.
[02:25:33.209 --> 02:25:37.892]  Look, I love following the money, stitching things together and understanding what's happening in the world.
[02:25:38.312 --> 02:25:42.895]  You can find me at Cashew Nate on Instagram and on Twitter.
[02:25:43.836 --> 02:25:52.962]  Our business, Cashew, has just launched a Protect America pack, which has stock picks every month based off AI algorithmic trading.
[02:25:54.002 --> 02:26:04.548]  It's also heavily influenced by my research and our team's research, and all we're trying to do is safeguard the financial future of all U.S.
[02:26:04.588 --> 02:26:06.549]  citizens and citizens around the world.
[02:26:06.729 --> 02:26:12.012]  So it's been a pleasure being on, Alex, and I look forward to chatting again in the future.
[02:26:12.392 --> 02:26:13.093]  I love your work.
[02:26:14.233 --> 02:26:15.654]  Thank you, Nathan Derriman.
[02:26:15.674 --> 02:26:17.195]  We'll talk to you soon, and God bless.
[02:26:17.215 --> 02:26:17.615]  Keep it up.
[02:26:19.256 --> 02:26:19.897]  Thank you, guys.
[02:26:20.077 --> 02:26:20.397]  Catch ya.
[02:26:21.016 --> 02:26:26.918]  All right, I had Dr. Kirk Elliott on back at noon, so that was an hour and 40 minutes ago.
[02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:38.941]  He's an economist, his predictions for years have been dead on, and he said, we showed the news headlines, CNBC, Wall Street Journal, everybody, they were saying that it's going to be a quarter rate cut.
[02:26:39.461 --> 02:26:44.042]  He said, I'm looking for something that'll be bigger, and he explained why, of half a point.
[02:26:45.203 --> 02:26:49.524]  And so let's go ahead and play that prediction, and then we're going to get Dr. Kirk Elliott on right after that.
[02:26:50.458 --> 02:26:52.098]  So they've got this catch-22.
[02:26:52.438 --> 02:26:58.200]  It's like, do we do too little, or do we do too much, and are we doing it too soon?
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.060]  This is the problem that they have.
[02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:07.162]  But they've chosen inflation over recession, and this is going to have an impact on the market.
[02:27:07.222 --> 02:27:13.823]  So my prediction today, is it going to be 25 basis points or 50 basis points, a quarter, half?
[02:27:15.063 --> 02:27:17.204]  I'm leaning like 60-40 that it's going to be 50.
[02:27:19.227 --> 02:27:28.691]  Just because I think they really want to make a name for themselves saying, look, we are going to fight this and fight this hard and rates have been too high for too long.
[02:27:29.212 --> 02:27:33.314]  I wouldn't be surprised if we get a quarter either because they're kind of pansies on it.
[02:27:33.374 --> 02:27:35.474]  They know what the inflationary pressures are.
[02:27:36.255 --> 02:27:37.415]  But my guess would be 50.
[02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.556]  Look at where we are.
[02:27:39.936 --> 02:27:44.298]  The Fed starts cutting rates on that blue line.
[02:27:44.839 --> 02:27:45.459]  That was from 1966 to 1982.
[02:27:48.433 --> 02:27:54.255]  Now in red, you know, this is very reminiscent of where we are today, right?
[02:27:54.295 --> 02:27:59.776]  So when you lower interest rates, inflation persists, right?
[02:27:59.816 --> 02:28:01.157]  And this was right where we're now.
[02:28:01.557 --> 02:28:05.198]  Jerome Powell says we're going to lower rates and we're going to have a series of lowering rates.
[02:28:05.938 --> 02:28:07.919]  Inflation is going to go through the roof, Alex.
[02:28:08.519 --> 02:28:11.063]  Through the roof, and this is going to be bad for America.
[02:28:11.083 --> 02:28:15.409]  This is going to be bad for everybody who's living at the margin.
[02:28:15.970 --> 02:28:19.936]  And so can he avoid a recession?
[02:28:20.256 --> 02:28:22.059]  Can Jerome Powell avoid a recession?
[02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:24.202]  The answer is, yeah.
[02:28:25.123 --> 02:28:31.848]  He can avoid a recession by going into stagflation, right, and having a stagnant economy with higher prices.
[02:28:31.888 --> 02:28:33.449]  That's worse than a recession.
[02:28:33.489 --> 02:28:39.293]  So he can avoid that, but what the avoidance is, it's like making it worse.
[02:28:39.893 --> 02:28:43.395]  It's like jumping, trying to jump off the, you're in the middle of the street.
[02:28:43.415 --> 02:28:47.098]  Sure, so watching what they're doing, Dr. Elliott, in layman's terms, what's going to happen?
[02:28:48.809 --> 02:28:55.252]  Oh, we go into a series, a stage in our economy where the economy is slowing down.
[02:28:55.332 --> 02:28:56.553]  People are losing jobs.
[02:28:56.613 --> 02:28:58.093]  Inflation is persisting.
[02:28:58.133 --> 02:28:59.254]  That's stagflation.
[02:28:59.694 --> 02:29:06.677]  When people have less to pay for things, but the prices of everything that they're paying for go up, that's stagflation.
[02:29:07.017 --> 02:29:09.759]  That is a policymaker's worst nightmare.
[02:29:10.399 --> 02:29:13.320]  And so you're going to see I think that's where we're headed to.
[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:16.642]  It's like the late 70s, early 80s all over again.
[02:29:16.662 --> 02:29:23.125]  Reagan fixed it by jacking up interest rates ultimately into the mid teens to slow down inflation.
[02:29:23.145 --> 02:29:26.787]  So we're going to have this series of rate reductions for a little bit.
[02:29:27.447 --> 02:29:28.768]  And then they have to go up.
[02:29:29.188 --> 02:29:35.291]  They have to go up to slow down that inflation that's coming because everything that we're seeing is a facade.
[02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:38.289]  All right, that was an hour and 45 minutes ago.
[02:29:38.589 --> 02:29:41.012]  An hour later, they made the exact announcement he said.
[02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:50.440]  Despite the fact CNBC, Wall Street Journal, New York Times said quarter fed to cut rates by a quarter point with a soft landing expected according to CNBC fund survey.
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:51.581]  That was out this morning.
[02:29:51.621 --> 02:29:52.222]  They're wrong.
[02:29:52.342 --> 02:29:53.483]  Infowars is right again.
[02:29:53.503 --> 02:29:56.546]  Dr. Elliott, what does this mean now that it's a full half point?
[02:29:58.382 --> 02:29:59.903]  It means that they're scared, Alex.
[02:30:00.564 --> 02:30:05.508]  I think that they are scared silly that we're going to go into this recession.
[02:30:05.568 --> 02:30:06.709]  So they did more.
[02:30:07.149 --> 02:30:10.472]  But here's where, OK, another prediction that I'll make.
[02:30:11.913 --> 02:30:15.716]  You know, they think that we're going to have another quarter point before the end of the year.
[02:30:15.836 --> 02:30:17.877]  I bet it's going to be another half again.
[02:30:18.658 --> 02:30:35.011]  And then Jerome Powell said we're going to have four rate reductions next year and two in 2026 because they've tackled this and they're very happy about the labor market and how robust it is and what Biden is doing for the economy.
[02:30:35.031 --> 02:30:41.335]  It's like, OK, this is where I think that they're I don't know what they're smoking, really, because it's so
[02:30:42.236 --> 02:30:42.696]  Wrong.
[02:30:43.217 --> 02:30:44.878]  So you look at what's happening today.
[02:30:45.358 --> 02:30:50.661]  Boeing is furloughing tens of thousands of workers and considering more layoffs.
[02:30:51.022 --> 02:30:53.023]  Tupperware filed for bankruptcy.
[02:30:53.123 --> 02:30:54.604]  Big Lots filed for bankruptcy.
[02:30:54.644 --> 02:30:58.947]  It's like, where are all these jobs when companies are laying off, right?
[02:30:59.367 --> 02:31:02.149]  So we do have this recession.
[02:31:02.189 --> 02:31:03.910]  It's not going to be a soft landing.
[02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:05.951]  It's going to be a harsh one.
[02:31:06.471 --> 02:31:08.613]  But here's where I think
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:26.390]  When Trump gets elected, which I believe that he is going to, and he's going to start growing the economy and being robust, and the Fed in 2025 and 2026 is going to say, this economy is growing, we're going to have to raise interest rates to slow down inflation.
[02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:36.657]  And it's like, okay, inflation coming from a growing economy is normal, because the economy can sustain higher prices because people are working and people are spending.
[02:31:37.317 --> 02:31:47.024]  We can't afford higher prices now because in a sluggish economy, the way that the government gets out of it is by printing money, not by people spending it, right?
[02:31:47.084 --> 02:31:51.628]  So this is the worst of all possible scenarios that we're entering into.
[02:31:53.806 --> 02:31:55.987]  People need to get silver and gold.
[02:31:56.087 --> 02:31:58.688]  You're the highest rated, best place to get it, hands down.
[02:31:58.728 --> 02:31:59.948]  That's Alex Jones telling you that.
[02:32:00.509 --> 02:32:01.669]  And I don't ever try to steer you wrong.
[02:32:01.729 --> 02:32:02.569]  I'm almost never wrong.
[02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:04.630]  It's the smartest investment, obviously.
[02:32:04.650 --> 02:32:06.911]  And in these times, you're insane if you don't get into silver now.
[02:32:07.671 --> 02:32:09.532]  Kirk will tell you when he thinks you should get into gold.
[02:32:09.572 --> 02:32:10.792]  If you want gold, he'll give it to you.
[02:32:10.812 --> 02:32:11.893]  He'll sell it to you right now.
[02:32:12.153 --> 02:32:13.313]  You'll get the best deal out there.
[02:32:13.974 --> 02:32:19.956]  But what does this signify, the half a point cut towards precious metals?
[02:32:21.496 --> 02:32:30.942]  Well, like we talked about an hour ago, when interest rates come down, gold and silver really, really do well.
[02:32:31.002 --> 02:32:40.548]  Just since the announcement, which was, what, 48 minutes ago, silver's up 60 cents, gold's up like 20 bucks, and it was down prior to that.
[02:32:40.968 --> 02:32:46.612]  So it did a complete reversal and is now going up, which is what we expect.
[02:32:46.792 --> 02:32:49.014]  This is why I've been telling people, since our last
[02:32:51.275 --> 02:32:53.896]  Show that we recorded, I don't know, it was like a week and a half ago.
[02:32:53.916 --> 02:32:56.136]  I can't remember, but it's like, you know what?
[02:32:56.236 --> 02:32:58.077]  They are going to lower interest rates.
[02:32:58.237 --> 02:33:05.859]  I would get in now, because as interest rates continue to come down, the price of metals is going to really go up.
[02:33:05.979 --> 02:33:15.402]  So what we're seeing right now is silver close to $31 an ounce, and I believe it's going to continue to grow robustly.
[02:33:15.742 --> 02:33:19.403]  When you have rate reductions, and we can look at charts from the past,
[02:33:19.983 --> 02:33:26.668]  You know, whenever you have a series of rate reductions, the price of precious metals on average goes up about 300% after that.
[02:33:26.748 --> 02:33:31.892]  So it's like I'm expecting even if it were half of that, Alex, I'd be very, very happy.
[02:33:32.313 --> 02:33:33.313]  Everybody would.
[02:33:33.694 --> 02:33:33.914]  Right.
[02:33:33.994 --> 02:33:41.240]  But but we're entering into now not just a rate reduction time frame for a little bit.
[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:43.882]  We're entering into flight for quality.
[02:33:44.562 --> 02:33:53.647]  Right, as things around us start to erode, and you've got tensions, and you've got war, and you've got escalating tensions in the Middle East like nothing we've ever seen.
[02:33:53.707 --> 02:34:07.355]  You've got escalating tensions in China and Taiwan, and with Russia and Ukraine, and you've got Hamas, or no, the Houthis, you know, shooting hypersonic missiles into Israel.
[02:34:07.375 --> 02:34:09.736]  It's like, where do they get a hypersonic missile?
[02:34:09.857 --> 02:34:11.898]  And by the way, they're hitting the targets.
[02:34:12.678 --> 02:34:16.601]  They're hitting the targets and blowing up railway stations and stuff, and it's not getting hardly any attention.
[02:34:17.822 --> 02:34:20.624]  It's not getting any, and you have to look at the source of everything.
[02:34:20.664 --> 02:34:22.165]  It's like, where do the Houthis get it?
[02:34:22.185 --> 02:34:22.905]  They get it from Iran.
[02:34:22.925 --> 02:34:24.647]  Where does Iran get their money and support?
[02:34:24.687 --> 02:34:25.888]  From Russia, right?
[02:34:25.908 --> 02:34:30.311]  So this is an attack against Western civilization as we know it.
[02:34:30.611 --> 02:34:32.652]  When you have that kind of fear,
[02:34:33.593 --> 02:34:33.813]  Right?
[02:34:34.133 --> 02:34:36.375]  It's going to propel metals upwards.
[02:34:36.455 --> 02:34:46.080]  Now, the one thing that I wanted to make sure that we covered is the unified ledger that we had talked about briefly a little over an hour ago.
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:47.241]  And now it's taking shape.
[02:34:47.281 --> 02:34:49.602]  The private sector partners joined Project Agora.
[02:34:49.982 --> 02:34:50.683]  Explain what that means.
[02:34:51.610 --> 02:35:19.916]  Okay, so Project Agora is Bank for International Settlements putting together now the final design of the Unified Ledger program, right, which is basically putting all of your assets into one packet and you can change ownership on it because it's programmable money, which means if they don't like you, Alex, if they don't like your messaging, if they don't like who you donate to because of your religion's preferences or what political party you give to or what kind of food you eat,
[02:35:20.396 --> 02:35:21.457]  They can shut you off.
[02:35:21.537 --> 02:35:23.098]  This is your social credit score, right?
[02:35:23.138 --> 02:35:30.144]  So the point is, we all know that that's what central bank digital currency is all about because we've talked about it numerous times.
[02:35:30.565 --> 02:35:37.330]  But now let's look at the partners who've said, yeah, we're going to help you build this platform of a unified ledger.
[02:35:37.751 --> 02:35:44.577]  So on the Bank for International Settlements website, the private sector partners joining this Project Agora are
[02:35:45.177 --> 02:35:46.518]  I'm not going to list all of them.
[02:35:46.578 --> 02:35:51.159]  Some of them are foreign banks, but I'm going to list the ones that the viewers here would probably know about.
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:36:01.924]  BBVA, BNP Paribas, Bank of New York, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase.
[02:36:02.044 --> 02:36:02.764]  That's a big one.
[02:36:03.064 --> 02:36:03.885]  MasterCard?
[02:36:04.385 --> 02:36:04.626]  Okay.
[02:36:05.146 --> 02:36:05.747]  And Visa?
[02:36:06.027 --> 02:36:07.809]  Who doesn't have a MasterCard or Visa, right?
[02:36:07.849 --> 02:36:12.413]  So all of these assets, they're going to be put into a unified ledger.
[02:36:12.873 --> 02:36:16.016]  Then you've got the SWIFT system, which is massive.
[02:36:16.717 --> 02:36:24.564]  And that's where all international bank wires, domestic bank wires, if you're sending money from bank to bank, it's part of the SWIFT system.
[02:36:25.005 --> 02:36:25.605]  TD Bank,
[02:36:26.266 --> 02:36:30.771]  Toronto Dominion, UBS, and there's even a gold dealer on there, Monax.
[02:36:30.851 --> 02:36:32.172]  It's like, what in the world?
[02:36:32.212 --> 02:36:35.415]  Talk about, you know, where you buy your gold or silver from.
[02:36:35.475 --> 02:36:36.276]  Should it be safe?
[02:36:36.296 --> 02:36:37.097]  Should it be private?
[02:36:37.117 --> 02:36:47.607]  It's like, what in the world is going on here where these are all some of the 40 financial institutions and private sector partners
[02:36:48.228 --> 02:37:03.443]  That are helping the globalist build their utopia, which Alex, at the end of this month, the United Nations Bank for International Settlements, their big, huge thing that they've been working on forever, right?
[02:37:03.503 --> 02:37:09.949]  Well, not forever, since 2019, which they're going to say the blueprint for the future monetary system.
[02:37:09.989 --> 02:37:11.511]  They're laying it all out there.
[02:37:12.031 --> 02:37:19.097]  From social credit scores, and digital social profiles, and Project Enbridge, and tracking everybody, and programmable money.
[02:37:19.717 --> 02:37:26.963]  And there's this video that I saw of Hillary Clinton, where this is all part of it.
[02:37:27.243 --> 02:37:32.627]  This social credit scoring, your ideology, they want to silence everybody.
[02:37:32.667 --> 02:37:33.468]  And this is where
[02:37:34.048 --> 02:37:38.491]  Well, let's just watch it real quick and then we can talk about the implications of this on your bank accounts.
[02:37:38.511 --> 02:37:39.812]  Yeah, let's roll Hillary Clinton.
[02:37:39.832 --> 02:37:42.053]  She wasn't just calling for our arrest for free speech two days ago.
[02:37:42.073 --> 02:37:42.834]  She also said this.
[02:37:43.594 --> 02:37:45.736]  And boosting Trump back in 2016.
[02:37:46.176 --> 02:37:52.920]  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[02:37:53.921 --> 02:38:02.427]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[02:38:04.002 --> 02:38:04.262]  Kirk?
[02:38:05.664 --> 02:38:07.406]  Okay, what is she talking about?
[02:38:07.446 --> 02:38:09.329]  She's talking about elimination of our free speech.
[02:38:09.369 --> 02:38:22.826]  She's talking about these kind of things adding into your social credit score and your ideology so you can have ideologically based testing of your spending to cut you off from your bank account.
[02:38:23.166 --> 02:38:33.091]  So imagine this world, Alex, where you say something, you spend money on something, and if they don't like it, they can cut you off.
[02:38:33.691 --> 02:38:41.415]  So here's where this becomes very, very dangerous, because you don't need an army walking down the streets
[02:38:41.855 --> 02:38:46.478]  With ARs and machine guns to enforce their policies.
[02:38:46.858 --> 02:38:52.762]  You can do it so clean and easy if you're a globalist, where you just say, we're just going to cut you off from your money.
[02:38:53.143 --> 02:38:56.485]  You really want to control and force compliance on somebody?
[02:38:56.805 --> 02:39:01.928]  You separate them from their bank account to force that kind of compliance.
[02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:06.992]  This is where the social credit scores from the World Economic Forum really come into play.
[02:39:07.032 --> 02:39:08.453]  And what Hillary just said
[02:39:09.613 --> 02:39:18.520]  They're actually going to talk about free speech, and what you say, and what you do, just like they did in Australia last week.
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:19.921]  California just signed a bill.
[02:39:20.601 --> 02:39:22.383]  They say your meme's a step to prison time.
[02:39:22.403 --> 02:39:24.184]  So, here's what I want to say to the listeners.
[02:39:24.244 --> 02:39:28.027]  I know they're hardcore, they get it, but to new viewers and other people.
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:35.668]  Going along with the globalists and playing along with us to get ahead, you're literally enslaving yourself like a useful idiot.
[02:39:36.048 --> 02:39:37.210]  The globalists are targeting everybody.
[02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:39.112]  They want to depopulate us to 500 million.
[02:39:39.152 --> 02:39:40.093]  We're at eight and a half billion.
[02:39:40.814 --> 02:39:42.475]  They're giving people poison shots and masks.
[02:39:42.495 --> 02:39:44.017]  Their own people are dropping like flies.
[02:39:44.057 --> 02:39:47.300]  Sports stars, movie stars, music people, everywhere.
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:48.160]  35 million dead from the shots.
[02:39:48.461 --> 02:39:49.581]  You're all being targeted.
[02:39:49.642 --> 02:39:50.722]  Don't have Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:39:50.742 --> 02:39:52.704]  Don't pretend by going along your safe.
[02:39:53.044 --> 02:39:58.369]  We've got to build the farms, get into the precious metals, build our own infrastructure, shop local.
[02:39:58.409 --> 02:40:00.271]  We've got to keep cash.
[02:40:00.351 --> 02:40:03.834]  We've got to keep our ability to hunt and trap and live.
[02:40:03.874 --> 02:40:06.216]  They want to domesticate us for extermination.
[02:40:06.776 --> 02:40:09.643]  And the CBDC is the crown and the jewel of all of this.
[02:40:09.683 --> 02:40:10.865]  That's what Kirk Elliott's saying.
[02:40:12.639 --> 02:40:13.920]  Yeah, it is.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:17.743]  It's kind of a get-out-of-the-system kind of a currency, right?
[02:40:17.803 --> 02:40:22.987]  It's not something that can be reprogrammed if you have it at home, even if you have it stored.
[02:40:23.087 --> 02:40:24.188]  It's not digital.
[02:40:24.708 --> 02:40:26.009]  It's not a certificate.
[02:40:26.189 --> 02:40:28.271]  It's not a piece of paper, right?
[02:40:28.331 --> 02:40:33.394]  And when you have tangible assets, it's kind of like your get-out-of-Dodge, Alex.
[02:40:33.535 --> 02:40:39.139]  It's getting out of a globalist system of tracking, control, compliance,
[02:40:39.879 --> 02:40:40.880]  Um, and let's be clear.
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:42.001]  I'm not against Bitcoin.
[02:40:42.041 --> 02:40:43.942]  I think people should hedge their bets and everything.
[02:40:44.382 --> 02:40:46.864]  But it's been the steam valve to try to keep gold and silver down.
[02:40:46.884 --> 02:40:49.305]  People think that's the thing that's going to protect them.
[02:40:49.345 --> 02:40:51.767]  No, it's going to be full spectrum diversity.
[02:40:52.187 --> 02:40:54.049]  Gold and silver are right at the center of that.
[02:40:54.069 --> 02:40:55.370]  We've got to go to break in a minute.
[02:40:55.490 --> 02:40:57.231]  We've got the great Royce White coming up.
[02:40:57.271 --> 02:41:01.333]  I'm going to premiere the Rescue the Republic trailer that Mickey Willis just sent to me earlier.
[02:41:01.354 --> 02:41:02.234]  It's premiering right now.
[02:41:02.614 --> 02:41:03.635]  It's on X. We just posted.
[02:41:03.675 --> 02:41:06.997]  I'm going to play it on air at six after they hand the baton to Royce White.
[02:41:07.017 --> 02:41:09.359]  But I want to come back and have you finish up
[02:41:10.159 --> 02:41:13.181]  On the points and other key topics and documents you sent me, Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[02:41:13.502 --> 02:41:17.264]  But everybody needs to call you or go online to have a free consultation.
[02:41:17.284 --> 02:41:19.206]  You're the place to get silver and gold.
[02:41:19.666 --> 02:41:22.708]  Everybody needs to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:41:22.748 --> 02:41:23.188]  Just simple.
[02:41:23.248 --> 02:41:24.029]  Kirk Elliott Precious Metals.
[02:41:24.429 --> 02:41:24.909]  The initials.
[02:41:24.989 --> 02:41:27.791]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:41:28.112 --> 02:41:29.392]  That's the link for Alex Jones and us.
[02:41:29.412 --> 02:41:30.113]  So we know the support.
[02:41:30.133 --> 02:41:31.214]  He just ups the advertising.
[02:41:31.574 --> 02:41:34.336]  We would not have the funds to still be on air if he hadn't come along with us.
[02:41:34.956 --> 02:41:37.798]  11 months ago, I didn't have any gold sponsors before that because they couldn't be trusted.
[02:41:37.818 --> 02:41:38.759]  I didn't even think of Kurt Gillian.
[02:41:38.779 --> 02:41:41.360]  I was trying to get him on as a guest, and boom, he's like, hey, I'll be a sponsor.
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:44.402]  I wasn't even thinking because I was just so disgusted with the industry.
[02:41:44.483 --> 02:41:47.104]  It's a great thing to be in, but there's a bunch of sharks out there.
[02:41:47.164 --> 02:41:48.185]  He's got the highest ratings.
[02:41:48.205 --> 02:41:49.046]  He's the place to go.
[02:41:49.426 --> 02:41:50.266]  I wouldn't steer you wrong.
[02:41:50.306 --> 02:41:51.187]  You know that, folks.
[02:41:51.267 --> 02:41:54.889]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 720-605-3000.
[02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:59.993]  I could have five times the sponsorship with the sharks, but I won't have that in my life.
[02:42:00.333 --> 02:42:01.114]  I'm steering you right.
[02:42:01.154 --> 02:42:01.874]  The proof's there.
[02:42:01.934 --> 02:42:02.595]  Highest ratings.
[02:42:02.895 --> 02:42:06.718]  KEPM.com forward slash gold at 720-605-3900.
[02:42:06.738 --> 02:42:07.118]  Stay with us.
[02:42:07.538 --> 02:42:16.265]  I got a great way for you to keep InfoWars on the air, and regardless of what happens, InfoWars keep me on the air, and that's thealexjonesstore.com, a new key URL for you to mark down.
[02:42:16.725 --> 02:42:20.028]  I've teamed up with the folks that make a lot of the top-selling Trump shirts in the country.
[02:42:20.068 --> 02:42:21.889]  They've got the best t-shirt designers, Bigley.
[02:42:22.229 --> 02:42:25.952]  If you go to thealexjonesstore.com, that's separate from InfoWars.
[02:42:26.152 --> 02:42:26.853]  That's key to support.
[02:42:27.013 --> 02:42:28.174]  Into the future, whatever happens here.
[02:42:28.194 --> 02:42:31.197]  30 plus amazing new t-shirt designs.
[02:42:31.457 --> 02:42:32.718]  New ones being added every day.
[02:42:33.079 --> 02:42:33.759]  They're incredible.
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:34.660]  Trump shirts.
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:35.361]  You name it.
[02:42:35.721 --> 02:42:37.503]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:42:37.843 --> 02:42:44.230]  And every time you buy a shirt or 30 plus different great designs of Patriot ball caps, you get entered 5 or 10 times, depending on the day.
[02:42:44.290 --> 02:42:44.990]  It's different every day.
[02:42:45.391 --> 02:42:47.553]  Into the raffle to get $10,000 cash.
[02:42:48.033 --> 02:42:48.614]  Halloween's with them.
[02:42:48.894 --> 02:43:02.988]  The prize is announced, the winner, and a $138,000 turbo diesel, super deluxe, off-road upgraded, the best truck you can get, over-the-top, turbo diesel engine, AEV standard features, and then it's all upgraded.
[02:43:03.228 --> 02:43:04.450]  I tried to go over and take an hour.
[02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:07.272]  The best tires, the best shocks, the best systems.
[02:43:07.613 --> 02:43:12.518]  It's a 2024 Ram Prospector AEV Dodge turbo diesel.
[02:43:13.158 --> 02:43:15.179]  Army green, black, and red pinstripe.
[02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:16.340]  Ready for you.
[02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:20.903]  When you buy something, you can enter five or ten times, depending on what promo they're running that day, in the raffle.
[02:43:21.263 --> 02:43:22.824]  All at thealexjonestore.com.
[02:43:22.844 --> 02:43:25.226]  But the t-shirts, the reason to go there, keep us on air.
[02:43:25.246 --> 02:43:26.386]  And these are badass shirts.
[02:43:26.807 --> 02:43:28.908]  They've got over 30 incredible t-shirt designs.
[02:43:28.928 --> 02:43:29.669]  I think there's more now.

[02:43:33.971 --> 02:43:34.572]  They're designer.

[02:43:35.993 --> 02:43:36.733]  They're all there.
[02:43:36.973 --> 02:43:39.074]  Some of the M4's classics, they updated, made even better.
[02:43:39.094 --> 02:43:41.036]  A lot of new incredible designs.
[02:43:42.125 --> 02:43:43.205]  A lot of Alex Jones shirts.
[02:43:43.225 --> 02:43:44.926]  A lot of Trump shirts.
[02:43:45.026 --> 02:43:48.387]  It's all there at thealexjonestore.com.

[02:43:51.849 --> 02:43:52.609]  It spreads the word.

[02:44:07.452 --> 02:44:17.798]  Final segment with Dr. Kirk Elliott that will premiere the Rescue the Republic trailer for a film but also the massive event coming up in just a few weeks in or less than two weeks in D.C.
[02:44:17.858 --> 02:44:19.479]  with Trump and RFK Jr.
[02:44:19.539 --> 02:44:19.940]  and so many others.
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:21.320]  I've been invited to it.
[02:44:22.021 --> 02:44:26.384]  I'm probably not going to go because I'm here in the bunker reaching tens of millions a day and they've got it covered.
[02:44:26.404 --> 02:44:27.724]  But it's a unification thing.
[02:44:27.764 --> 02:44:28.265]  It's powerful.
[02:44:28.305 --> 02:44:28.785]  It's amazing.
[02:44:29.345 --> 02:44:30.146]  Look at these headlines.
[02:44:30.606 --> 02:44:33.728]  Gold prices will gain in Q4 on Fed cuts.
[02:44:34.169 --> 02:44:34.829]  Election risk.
[02:44:34.869 --> 02:44:35.770]  Chinese rebounds.
[02:44:35.850 --> 02:44:38.472]  Silver sees massive support from India.
[02:44:39.132 --> 02:44:41.474]  Why Goldman Commodity Desk thinks silver is about to soar.
[02:44:41.494 --> 02:44:42.115]  It already is.
[02:44:42.515 --> 02:44:45.617]  Russian businesses now using gold to pay Chinese suppliers.
[02:44:45.997 --> 02:44:48.499]  Russian launched digital ruble for public by 2025.
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:50.201]  Partially gold back.
[02:44:50.581 --> 02:44:52.702]  An unprecedented monetary destruction is coming.
[02:44:53.343 --> 02:44:55.624]  John Paulson will see a crash under
[02:44:56.365 --> 02:44:57.506]  Paris tax plans.
[02:44:57.966 --> 02:44:59.026]  It goes on and on.
[02:44:59.486 --> 02:45:02.068]  Crash coming or will we normalize hyperinflation?
[02:45:02.828 --> 02:45:03.488]  Smoke and mirrors.
[02:45:03.528 --> 02:45:05.989]  What happens under Biden's economic manipulations?
[02:45:06.049 --> 02:45:07.050]  Despair.
[02:45:07.570 --> 02:45:10.391]  In closing under Elliott, we're going to have a crash landing.
[02:45:10.451 --> 02:45:11.151]  Is it survivable?
[02:45:11.292 --> 02:45:12.692]  On the good side of Trump, it's in.
[02:45:12.732 --> 02:45:13.292]  What do we see?
[02:45:13.693 --> 02:45:15.013]  Bad side, Kamala gets in.
[02:45:15.573 --> 02:45:16.614]  What are we looking at here?
[02:45:16.994 --> 02:45:18.835]  Best scenario to worst scenario?
[02:45:20.350 --> 02:45:22.131]  Best scenario, Trump gets in.
[02:45:22.151 --> 02:45:26.852]  And I don't want people's expectations to be so extreme on Trump.
[02:45:26.872 --> 02:45:28.812]  It's like he's going to fix this thing overnight.
[02:45:28.852 --> 02:45:31.553]  And on day one, it's going to be all different.
[02:45:31.973 --> 02:45:38.015]  He's got so much damage to unwind that the Biden administration has done to our economy.
[02:45:39.095 --> 02:45:44.877]  It's going to take a good time for him to recover from that and get us back to zero even.
[02:45:44.977 --> 02:45:47.258]  So during that kind of mayhem,
[02:45:47.958 --> 02:45:52.742]  Golden Silver do really, really, really well because it's this flight for quality, right?
[02:45:52.862 --> 02:45:54.664]  Uncertainty, turbulence, turmoil, change.
[02:45:55.044 --> 02:45:56.145]  But he will get it done.
[02:45:56.505 --> 02:45:58.006]  He does because what's he going to do?
[02:45:58.447 --> 02:46:03.931]  He wants to abolish personal income tax, replace it with tariffs and excise taxes on foreign goods.
[02:46:04.191 --> 02:46:05.072]  That's amazing!
[02:46:05.572 --> 02:46:07.634]  Get rid of the taxes on working poor.
[02:46:08.114 --> 02:46:09.396]  Get rid of overtime tax.
[02:46:09.436 --> 02:46:10.456]  Get rid of tax on tips.
[02:46:10.496 --> 02:46:10.897]  Beautiful.
[02:46:12.267 --> 02:46:12.907]  It's amazing.
[02:46:13.088 --> 02:46:19.331]  I mean, it's really a rock-solid economic plan that is good for Americans, right?
[02:46:19.731 --> 02:46:24.434]  So, but it'll take a little bit of time to get to that point, but don't, just be patient.
[02:46:24.474 --> 02:46:25.175]  You'll get it done.
[02:46:25.715 --> 02:46:32.599]  So, I think moving forward, the sky is so bright and so clear for the American economy.
[02:46:32.639 --> 02:46:35.801]  But if Kamala gets in, I mean, even the Federal Reserve says curtains.
[02:46:37.383 --> 02:46:38.563]  Yeah, it's done.
[02:46:38.583 --> 02:46:47.685]  I mean, I don't think America as we know it can survive four years of Biden and four years of Kamala, right?
[02:46:47.765 --> 02:46:58.047]  It's these Marxist agenda policies, massive taxation, massive government overreach, silencing of freedom voices, right?
[02:46:58.247 --> 02:47:01.488]  You add all of that together, and what is it gonna come to?
[02:47:01.928 --> 02:47:03.508]  Civil unrest in the streets,
[02:47:04.048 --> 02:47:16.836]  I mean, I think we're gonna see like what we see in Chicago and Denver with these open borders bringing in violent crime from gangs in Venezuela marching around with machine guns.
[02:47:16.856 --> 02:47:24.421]  It's like, okay, this is what breeds from economic disaster when people can't afford to live.
[02:47:24.861 --> 02:47:26.102]  They resort to crime.
[02:47:26.182 --> 02:47:28.023]  Criminals will always resort to crime, right?
[02:47:28.063 --> 02:47:31.025]  And so, but when you have- And it's all being done on purpose.
[02:47:31.997 --> 02:47:33.938]  Yeah, it's being done on purpose.
[02:47:33.978 --> 02:47:38.181]  I mean, they're allowing these people to vote, and they're not citizens, right?
[02:47:38.221 --> 02:47:44.244]  And so here's where I think this is a pivotal moment for America, this election.
[02:47:44.685 --> 02:47:46.606]  And we say every election is important.
[02:47:46.746 --> 02:47:52.790]  This one is the biggest one for the future of our republic that I have ever seen.
[02:47:53.310 --> 02:47:57.653]  Because after this, we've already lost our reserve currency status to the BRICS nations.
[02:47:58.453 --> 02:48:01.620]  What comes next is absolutely our freedoms.
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:06.191]  We have to remember, when governments run out of money, they start to do crazy things.
[02:48:07.754 --> 02:48:15.618]  And setting up these crisis that we're seeing, that's going to cause people to vote for something that they wouldn't have voted for otherwise.
[02:48:15.698 --> 02:48:16.418]  Alex, you know this.
[02:48:16.518 --> 02:48:21.761]  Everybody, you know, all the info warriors out there, they know this too because they've been listening to you forever.
[02:48:22.201 --> 02:48:29.464]  You know, if they don't get what they want, they're going to create a panic that's so bad that people will willingly give up their freedoms.
[02:48:29.524 --> 02:48:30.865]  And that's where I see us heading.
[02:48:31.085 --> 02:48:33.226]  Well, Dr. Elliott, you predicted it over an hour before they did it.
[02:48:33.246 --> 02:48:33.806]  Half a point.
[02:48:33.826 --> 02:48:35.087]  Everybody else is saying quarter point.
[02:48:35.647 --> 02:48:36.488]  You nailed it again.
[02:48:36.548 --> 02:48:37.769]  Everybody should call you.
[02:48:37.949 --> 02:48:39.250]  It's one of the bases they need to cover.
[02:48:39.270 --> 02:48:41.271]  Relationship with God is number one.
[02:48:41.371 --> 02:48:43.893]  Family, food, guns, communications.
[02:48:43.933 --> 02:48:45.334]  But then gold and silver, he's ready.
[02:48:45.374 --> 02:48:46.855]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[02:48:46.875 --> 02:48:46.935]  720-605-3900.
[02:48:46.955 --> 02:48:49.877]  Call him right now and talk to this great team.
[02:48:49.897 --> 02:48:50.617]  Dr. Elliott, great job.
[02:48:50.637 --> 02:48:51.858]  Talk to you soon, brother.
[02:48:57.159 --> 02:48:57.559]  We'll see you.
[02:48:57.659 --> 02:48:57.920]  Bye-bye.
[02:49:18.018 --> 02:49:19.658]  Working with Trump and RFK Jr.
[02:49:19.738 --> 02:49:21.579]  and just an incredible group of patriots.
[02:49:21.599 --> 02:49:26.580]  They've got the Rescue the Republic event coming up on the 29th of this month.
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:30.521]  I'll be in Reading, Pennsylvania with Tucker Carlson and Jack Posobiec.
[02:49:30.541 --> 02:49:33.582]  They're almost sold out of tickets at tuckercarlson.com.
[02:49:33.602 --> 02:49:34.503]  Look forward to seeing you there.
[02:49:34.543 --> 02:49:35.643]  It's going to be incredible.
[02:49:36.403 --> 02:49:38.223]  That's on the 23rd on Monday.
[02:49:38.263 --> 02:49:40.164]  I'll be flying up there on Sunday.
[02:49:40.644 --> 02:49:41.744]  Also doing some other stuff along there.
[02:49:41.764 --> 02:49:42.485]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:49:42.545 --> 02:49:43.625]  Can't wait to meet you guys.
[02:49:43.645 --> 02:49:44.485]  Can't wait to see you.
[02:49:44.765 --> 02:49:48.426]  But on the 29th, you go to jointheresistance.org.
[02:49:48.846 --> 02:49:50.947]  Rescue the Republic in D.C.
[02:49:51.007 --> 02:49:52.367]  This is going to be so important.
[02:49:52.787 --> 02:49:54.787]  Mickey Willis is also making a film about it.
[02:49:55.388 --> 02:49:57.148]  I'm making another film with him that's top secret.
[02:49:57.508 --> 02:50:00.829]  Here is the trailer, and then we hand the baton to the mighty Royce White.
[02:50:05.274 --> 02:50:06.996]  2020 is the code for healthy vision.
[02:50:08.157 --> 02:50:10.840]  It is also the year we were given the eyes to see.
[02:50:13.563 --> 02:50:17.387]  Today the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the liars at the levers.
[02:50:20.379 --> 02:50:24.062]  They are masters of deception, hell-bent to divide and conquer.
[02:50:24.082 --> 02:50:25.423]  Some radicals on the far right.
[02:50:25.443 --> 02:50:27.425]  It's not just the far-left wackos!
[02:50:27.645 --> 02:50:32.809]  Like magicians, they use the art of redirection to keep us distracted, as they trick us.
[02:50:34.051 --> 02:50:37.814]  Nearly every war we have fought was initiated by their propaganda.
[02:50:38.014 --> 02:50:42.197]  Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant.
[02:50:43.338 --> 02:50:48.240]  As their empire of lies is collapsing, they are becoming increasingly desperate and dangerous.
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:52.681]  Russia, China, and Iran have announced the three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.
[02:50:52.761 --> 02:50:56.083]  The alliance that's been formed should kill us all to the bone.
[02:50:56.303 --> 02:50:59.344]  Their reckless war games have united a deadly alliance.
[02:51:00.384 --> 02:51:06.686]  Everything we have fought for, everything we've earned, and everything we love is under attack.
[02:51:06.746 --> 02:51:10.288]  Terror suspects at the southern borders... At what point do we say
[02:51:11.868 --> 02:51:13.330]  Enough is enough.
[02:51:16.852 --> 02:51:20.876]  Now is the time for the American people to wake up and rise up.
[02:51:21.877 --> 02:51:25.079]  A rebel alliance is forming in the name of liberty and life.
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:32.845]  People of every color, culture, creed, and ideology are putting politics aside to secure the eight pillars of peace and freedom.
[02:51:34.006 --> 02:51:36.688]  End the weaponization of science and medicine.
[02:51:37.088 --> 02:51:40.530]  If there is risk, there must be choice.
[02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:43.631]  Cease the expansion of surveillance and propaganda.
[02:51:43.751 --> 02:51:47.013]  They are killing us with censorship and propaganda.
[02:51:47.393 --> 02:51:49.595]  Stop central bank digital currencies.
[02:51:49.635 --> 02:51:53.897]  That will allow them to punish us from a distance and cut off our food supply.
[02:51:54.057 --> 02:51:56.538]  Prevent political abuse of our judicial system.
[02:51:56.658 --> 02:52:01.561]  What we are demanding is in fact the restoration of the rule of law.
[02:52:01.801 --> 02:52:03.202]  Secure our national borders.
[02:52:03.562 --> 02:52:08.844]  I'm tired of the United States doing nothing to protect the American people.
[02:52:08.904 --> 02:52:10.244]  Protect our children.
[02:52:10.584 --> 02:52:14.205]  To defend our children and to save an entire generation.
[02:52:14.425 --> 02:52:16.286]  Restore critical thinking and education.
[02:52:16.586 --> 02:52:20.087]  I think that the time for change is now and enough is enough.
[02:52:20.127 --> 02:52:23.608]  And above all, break our addiction to war.
[02:52:23.928 --> 02:52:31.270]  The nuclear threat is an emergency of the highest order and we are all in the crosshairs of this emergency.
[02:52:32.610 --> 02:52:40.232]  We must set aside our differences, work together to fire those warmongering politicians from both political parties.
[02:52:40.592 --> 02:52:47.933]  Everybody from the left, everybody from the right, everybody from the middle coming together to realize that we have more in common than divides us.
[02:52:48.053 --> 02:52:52.374]  What unites us is so much stronger than anything that divides us.
[02:52:52.614 --> 02:52:53.774]  We're a country of love!
[02:52:54.134 --> 02:52:56.015]  We're a country that care about people!
[02:52:56.055 --> 02:53:01.056]  The one thing that brings us together here today is that we value life.
[02:53:08.328 --> 02:53:16.634]  Every single principle on which the West is based is under simultaneous threat.
[02:53:17.595 --> 02:53:21.297]  We must defend the West.
[02:53:24.099 --> 02:53:26.141]  Jointheresistance.org.
[02:53:27.282 --> 02:53:32.666]  Coming up in 15 minutes, Owen Schroer, The War Room, InfoWars.com, four-slash-show, band-out video, Rel Alex Jones.
[02:53:33.106 --> 02:53:33.866]  This is a war.
[02:53:35.100 --> 02:53:37.921]  The greatest we've seen in our history.
[02:53:37.961 --> 02:53:39.041]  We're at the crossroads.
[02:53:39.081 --> 02:53:40.261]  We're fighting with everything we've got.
[02:53:40.401 --> 02:53:41.681]  We have the people.
[02:53:41.721 --> 02:53:48.123]  If you decide how powerful you are, as Paul Revere's, and share everything we're doing and others are doing, we will win.
[02:53:48.263 --> 02:53:50.003]  Royce White has won the primary.
[02:53:50.043 --> 02:53:52.564]  He's got a good shot at beating the Democrat senator.
[02:53:52.644 --> 02:53:53.644]  This is so critical.
[02:53:54.004 --> 02:53:56.505]  He's here to take over for the balance of the hour.
[02:53:56.605 --> 02:53:58.505]  Please, listeners, support us.
[02:53:58.565 --> 02:53:59.585]  Share the articles, the videos.
[02:53:59.605 --> 02:54:00.846]  Tell those you share it to, to share it.
[02:54:00.886 --> 02:54:02.046]  Tell those they share it to, to share it.
[02:54:02.586 --> 02:54:06.188]  That creates the chain reaction will be unstoppable and keep us on air.
[02:54:06.488 --> 02:54:15.293]  We need your support at our sponsors drjonesnaturals.com, infowarestore.com, and the new Super Patriot t-shirts at thealexjonestore.com.
[02:54:15.393 --> 02:54:16.213]  I can't do it without you.
[02:54:16.533 --> 02:54:17.414]  Please take action.
[02:54:17.694 --> 02:54:18.634]  Give us hate and comfort.
[02:54:18.834 --> 02:54:19.695]  We're all in this together.
[02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:21.176]  They're not trying to get me or Trump.
[02:54:21.396 --> 02:54:23.037]  They're not trying to get Royce White.
[02:54:23.257 --> 02:54:25.318]  They got to get through us to get to you.
[02:54:25.658 --> 02:54:31.201]  I know you know that, so stand with us because I don't know how this is going to end, but if the New World Order wants to fight,
[02:54:31.581 --> 02:54:33.102]  They better believe they got one!
[02:54:33.302 --> 02:54:33.803]  Royce White!
[02:54:35.604 --> 02:54:36.204]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:54:36.244 --> 02:54:37.865]  I appreciate it, brother, as always.
[02:54:37.905 --> 02:54:45.351]  And I appreciate the InfoWars audience since winning the primary and even before, since the endorsement process there in May.
[02:54:45.371 --> 02:54:46.912]  Nobody thought we could have success.
[02:54:47.512 --> 02:54:54.097]  Alex Jones has supported me and the InfoWars audience has supported me since 2022 when I ran for Congress.
[02:54:54.357 --> 02:54:55.658]  And we've defied the odds.
[02:54:55.678 --> 02:55:01.402]  You know, one of the most incredible things that's happened
[02:55:02.112 --> 02:55:06.553]  With my candidacy is that the entire establishment has lined up against me across the aisle.
[02:55:07.533 --> 02:55:11.414]  And that is what we have come to know and describe as the unit party.
[02:55:11.434 --> 02:55:13.754]  They've lined up against me since day one.
[02:55:14.195 --> 02:55:20.816]  When I first filed to run for United States Senate, none of the mainstream media would even acknowledge it, obviously, for obvious reasons.
[02:55:22.116 --> 02:55:28.278]  But when I won the endorsement, the mainstream media started their smear campaign, and they said there's no way I'd be able to win a primary.
[02:55:28.318 --> 02:55:30.278]  And they worked with their Republican
[02:55:31.531 --> 02:55:39.099]  Republican, quote unquote, running dogs, let's say, to try and stifle my win in the primary.
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:49.190]  Any number of things, media, money, insider connections, so on and so forth, and they failed, which is a great sign that this movement is working.
[02:55:49.210 --> 02:55:54.115]  I mean, when I started my campaign, when I filed for United States Senate, when I first built the website,
[02:55:54.670 --> 02:56:02.807]  When we put Alex Jones's face and soundbite at the beginning of our campaign launch video, every mainstream media outlet said there was no way
[02:56:03.339 --> 02:56:09.880]  There was no way I could have a successful United States Senate campaign hanging out with people like Alex Jones.
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:13.201]  And I just sat back and I said, you people have no clue what's going on.
[02:56:13.701 --> 02:56:24.723]  You people have no clue what's going on in this country and you have no clue what's going on with a person like Alex Jones and how important his work has been and how much he's contributed to the conversation.
[02:56:24.763 --> 02:56:26.884]  So it proved to be true.
[02:56:27.204 --> 02:56:27.784]  It proved to be true.
[02:56:27.824 --> 02:56:32.085]  He won a statewide federal Senate, United States Senate primary.
[02:56:32.401 --> 02:56:43.725]  With $140,000 in all volunteer staff, that tells you that the permanent political class has on this country is breaking.
[02:56:44.966 --> 02:56:53.069]  As Alex Jones always warns us, when the vice grip of tyrannical and corrupt power breaks, we have to be vigilant of their desperation.
[02:56:54.249 --> 02:56:57.650]  And we are remaining vigilant out there, I hope.
[02:56:57.690 --> 02:56:59.491]  But I want to run a clip.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:16.875]  Because I came across this clip on social media, and I try not to buy too much into what I see on social media, but it is a great barometer for where we are, because they're usually, and I want to preface by saying usually, because now AI and deepfakes are everywhere as well.
[02:57:16.956 --> 02:57:22.661]  And I mean, somebody told us that ahead of time, it was probably the great Alex Jones, and then now it's a reality.
[02:57:23.379 --> 02:57:30.043]  But it still is a great barometer because usually there are people on the other side of these screens.
[02:57:30.063 --> 02:57:40.708]  So I want to run this clip right here to try and highlight and paint a perfect picture of the economic situation that we face, especially young people.
[02:57:40.748 --> 02:57:43.410]  Let's roll the clip here if we can.
[02:57:43.430 --> 02:57:47.672]  Pay $2,100 a month for rent.
[02:57:49.333 --> 02:57:52.495]  Can't get a loan for a house because of credit.
[02:57:53.536 --> 02:57:57.939]  Trying to get a loan to pay off all of our debt, but can't do that because you don't have the credit.
[02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:07.265]  Can't afford a $1,600 home loan, but we can afford a $2,100 rent payment.
[02:58:09.147 --> 02:58:15.431]  We have to move because our landlord is selling her house and everywhere is $2,400, $2,500.
[02:58:15.491 --> 02:58:16.772]  Some places are $3,000 for rent.
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:25.640]  There you have it.
[02:58:26.121 --> 02:58:35.827]  I mean, you know, that's Gen Z, that's the tail end of the millennials, and the great Steve Bannon said, and shout out to the great Steve Bannon and the whole War Room posse as well, and everybody from that audience.
[02:58:35.867 --> 02:58:40.370]  I know we get a lot of cross over here in some of the circles, but the great Steve Bannon said it.
[02:58:40.570 --> 02:58:42.731]  He said, you know, we're living under neo-feudalism.
[02:58:43.492 --> 02:58:44.252]  Neo-feudalists.
[02:58:44.692 --> 02:58:50.276]  We're all being turned into 19th century Russian serfs, especially the millennials and the young people.
[02:58:51.342 --> 02:58:59.769]  They're better clothed, they're in better shape, they got more information than anybody in any other time in history, but they're not going to own anything.
[02:59:00.470 --> 02:59:02.532]  They don't own anything and they're not going to own anything.
[02:59:02.932 --> 02:59:10.498]  And if you market against their parents and their grandparents in terms of their income, they're way behind in their income.
[02:59:11.699 --> 02:59:13.581]  It's all gig economy.
[02:59:13.601 --> 02:59:15.142]  There are no pension plans for the future.
[02:59:16.425 --> 02:59:22.910]  We've essentially put the burden of the bailout that we said in 2009, 2008, on the working class and the middle class.
[02:59:23.651 --> 02:59:26.392]  And that is the neo-feudalist structure.
[02:59:26.412 --> 02:59:27.914]  That is the neo-feudalist framework.
[02:59:27.934 --> 02:59:31.956]  That is the neo-feudalist Ponzi scheme that they got running.
[02:59:32.437 --> 02:59:39.882]  You got a low class and the poor, the lumpenproletariat, and you got this upper class that socialized the risk.
[02:59:39.922 --> 02:59:42.884]  And then you got this working class and middle class that pays for the whole thing.
[02:59:43.619 --> 03:00:11.828]  I mean, if people like this young woman actually understood the very individuals who assume she will vote for them on the basis of cultural wedge issues actually constructed this entire economic and monetary system to her detriment, to the emotion she's feeling right now, these elections wouldn't even be close.
[03:00:13.533 --> 03:00:17.677]  There wouldn't even be a question of who would be winning in 2024 come November 5th.
[03:00:17.877 --> 03:00:18.758]  There would be no question.
[03:00:19.798 --> 03:00:33.811]  The very people who say the gays, the blacks, the women are this triune of identity and grievance politics, which make it obvious that Kamala Harris is the choice.
[03:00:34.431 --> 03:00:37.534]  These are the very people who set this system in motion.
[03:00:38.368 --> 03:00:39.549]  I mean, from the very roots of it.
[03:00:39.589 --> 03:00:41.871]  You could go all the way back, and I often do.
[03:00:41.951 --> 03:00:48.597]  I go back to the post-World War II Democratic-Liberal order, and people go, why are you talking about World War II doesn't have anything to do with today?
[03:00:48.977 --> 03:00:49.978]  Absolutely, it does.
[03:00:50.438 --> 03:00:52.040]  In fact, it has everything to do with today.
[03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:53.841]  You don't know how much it has to do with today.
[03:00:55.122 --> 03:00:59.606]  The post-World War II Democratic-Liberal order has so much to do with today that
[03:01:01.403 --> 03:01:08.725]  Kamala Harris openly defends that world order, along with all the other international dignitaries and world leaders from around the country.
[03:01:09.205 --> 03:01:14.107]  It's the prevailing geopolitical ideology, and it runs your country right down to your local community.
[03:01:15.627 --> 03:01:17.128]  Yeah, yeah, you don't live in the America of 1776.
[03:01:18.188 --> 03:01:19.168]  You live in the America of 1945.
[03:01:20.669 --> 03:01:24.530]  You live in the post-World War II, democratic, liberal order America.
[03:01:24.750 --> 03:01:25.550]  What was the scam?
[03:01:26.090 --> 03:01:28.751]  Let's walk through it as a refresher.
[03:01:30.515 --> 03:01:41.961]  The scam was, after World War II, the greatest threat to freedom and peace is nationalism, is Nazi Germany's nationalism, which was a lie by historical standards.
[03:01:41.981 --> 03:01:43.162]  He wasn't a nationalist.
[03:01:43.182 --> 03:01:44.262]  Hitler wasn't a nationalist.
[03:01:44.302 --> 03:01:47.464]  And it just so happens the Nazi Party wasn't really a nationalist party.
[03:01:47.504 --> 03:01:51.406]  In fact, they were a socialist party, hence the name, Nationalist Socialists.
[03:01:51.446 --> 03:01:58.810]  I mean, you can play with the semantics if you want to, but the reality is when you start to cross over into other people's borders,
[03:01:59.175 --> 03:02:10.504]  It's very hard to make the claim that you're a nationalist, especially at the level with which Nazi Germany decided to do it, and some of their admitted ambitions and aspirations as well.
[03:02:11.745 --> 03:02:13.426]  But the point, it's not even about Nazi Germany.
[03:02:13.446 --> 03:02:14.827]  Let's not even talk about Nazi Germany.
[03:02:15.328 --> 03:02:26.577]  If we're going to say anything about Nazi Germany, what we should go back and reference is that after World War I, the Nazis were made to pay reparations and American
[03:02:27.859 --> 03:02:38.623]  Wall Street financiers and others in the government agreed to loan the money to Nazi Germany to pay back their portion of the reparations to the rest of Europe.
[03:02:39.203 --> 03:02:45.926]  And when our economy hit turbulent times at the start of the Great Depression, we called in the loans.
[03:02:46.815 --> 03:02:58.922]  And us calling in the loans on a German economy that was already in ruin and trying to rebuild is the exact circumstance that Adolf Hitler used to raise the Nazi party.
[03:03:01.283 --> 03:03:05.606]  That is just airtight economic and geopolitical history.
[03:03:05.686 --> 03:03:06.827]  Accepted, well accepted.
[03:03:07.027 --> 03:03:14.271]  Our economic and monetary policy in this country and our economic practices played a prominent role
[03:03:16.001 --> 03:03:22.426]  And Adolf Hitler raising the Nazi party up there in Nazi Germany.
[03:03:23.567 --> 03:03:24.067]  One to one.
[03:03:25.008 --> 03:03:26.409]  And what did Adolf Hitler said?
[03:03:26.449 --> 03:03:30.152]  He said, hey, these Americans have put us in a, you know, in a trick box.
[03:03:30.872 --> 03:03:32.754]  You know, the German economy is going to collapse.
[03:03:33.474 --> 03:03:36.897]  And these American financiers and Wall Street bankers are the reason.
[03:03:36.997 --> 03:03:37.778]  And people believed it.
[03:03:37.818 --> 03:03:39.819]  And they believed it because partly it was true.
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:41.120]  That doesn't
[03:03:43.228 --> 03:03:48.573]  That doesn't absolve Adolf Hitler of the great atrocities that he committed with that information.
[03:03:48.613 --> 03:03:51.856]  And that's why I always say it's not just about information, it's how it's used.
[03:03:52.436 --> 03:03:54.658]  It's not just about tragedy, it's how it's weaponized.
[03:03:55.639 --> 03:04:05.808]  So if there's one thing we should look at from Nazi Germany, it's that our economic and monetary policy was the predicate for a lot of what took place.
[03:04:05.928 --> 03:04:07.269]  And now we're trying to do it again.
[03:04:08.194 --> 03:04:09.714]  We're gonna do it there in the Ukraine.
[03:04:09.774 --> 03:04:22.938]  You see all of these corporations lining up around the edge of the war zone to bid to be able to rebuild Ukraine after they forced Russia to blow it to pieces.
[03:04:24.778 --> 03:04:27.039]  You see the same thing happening there in Gaza.
[03:04:28.019 --> 03:04:34.581]  Yeah, if you dig deep enough, you'll find the white papers that say we're gonna turn Gaza into a beautiful new port.
[03:04:35.894 --> 03:04:44.858]  Globalism, globalization, you could say poking our nose in everybody else's business.
[03:04:45.638 --> 03:04:51.581]  Funding both sides of a war already led to the tragedy that's taken place there in the Middle East.
[03:04:51.921 --> 03:04:58.384]  No matter what side you fall on, everybody I think would agree when you have a war and life is lost that it's a great tragedy.
[03:04:59.484 --> 03:05:05.147]  But now we're going to go back and rebuild the same globalist business model.
[03:05:06.192 --> 03:05:10.393]  The same globalist institutions right back on top of the rubble and the dead bodies.
[03:05:10.453 --> 03:05:11.113]  It's disgusting.
[03:05:11.533 --> 03:05:14.453]  So if there's something we can learn from Nazi Germany, let's take that away.
[03:05:14.493 --> 03:05:19.334]  Our economic and monetary and global corporate practice is a predicate for war and death.
[03:05:19.394 --> 03:05:22.775]  We have a death and debt called globally.
[03:05:23.555 --> 03:05:24.095]  That's a fact.
[03:05:25.515 --> 03:05:27.136]  But let's go to what happened afterward.
[03:05:27.316 --> 03:05:34.237]  Afterward, we said we're going to take democracy and freedom all around the world at the tip of a spear.
[03:05:35.464 --> 03:05:37.864]  And by doing so, we're going to make people self-determining.
[03:05:37.884 --> 03:05:39.865]  We didn't make any of these nations self-determining.
[03:05:40.865 --> 03:05:41.965]  None of them are self-determining.
[03:05:41.985 --> 03:05:43.125]  They're all welfare nations.
[03:05:44.446 --> 03:05:47.946]  They are all what you would call reverse vassal states.
[03:05:49.266 --> 03:05:52.307]  We pay them to protect them in most cases.
[03:05:53.147 --> 03:05:56.308]  And it's not just Israel for all of these, you know, it's all Israel.
[03:05:56.668 --> 03:05:57.548]  It's not just Israel.
[03:05:57.768 --> 03:05:59.208]  It's Egypt.
[03:06:00.008 --> 03:06:01.669]  You know, it's the Qataris.
[03:06:02.009 --> 03:06:03.469]  I mean, it's the Emiratis.
[03:06:04.792 --> 03:06:05.432]  It's Ukraine.
[03:06:06.613 --> 03:06:06.913]  Pick one.
[03:06:06.953 --> 03:06:08.513]  It's the entire European Union.
[03:06:09.554 --> 03:06:11.114]  They're all reverse vassal states.
[03:06:11.614 --> 03:06:13.135]  We pay them to protect them.
[03:06:13.195 --> 03:06:14.595]  Why do we pay them to protect them?
[03:06:14.815 --> 03:06:16.535]  So they can tax you three times.
[03:06:17.556 --> 03:06:20.417]  And they're taxing you American working class citizens three times.
[03:06:20.457 --> 03:06:21.617]  Let me explain how it works.
[03:06:22.668 --> 03:06:32.131]  We, when I say we, I mean America and its representatives that we elected who took whispers from people like Henry Kissinger and Zygmunt Brzezinski, Klaus Schwab.
[03:06:32.531 --> 03:06:39.673]  We allowed our government to take our nation's military wherever our United States dollar was.
[03:06:40.433 --> 03:06:44.214]  Yeah, it became the reserve currency of the entire global economy.
[03:06:44.854 --> 03:06:51.916]  And so it justified us bringing our military there because wherever our United States dollar is, it is our sole greatest national interest.
[03:06:52.731 --> 03:06:53.832]  It's our number one export.
[03:06:54.612 --> 03:06:59.215]  So we take our military there and we start to trade with another country.
[03:06:59.235 --> 03:07:04.658]  And what happened was we sent our manufacturing to that country in many instances, a lot of instances.
[03:07:05.919 --> 03:07:10.982]  So we're trading with this country on an unequaled economic basis for the most part.
[03:07:11.802 --> 03:07:14.664]  And then we ship our labor to that country.
[03:07:15.638 --> 03:07:25.268]  Which inevitably is going to cause the cost of living here in America to rise because, hey, when you lose jobs, you have an issue with wages.
[03:07:26.490 --> 03:07:28.312]  That's just a fact.
[03:07:28.812 --> 03:07:36.140]  And when and if corporations could cut corners and cut costs by sending labor to another country that wasn't regulated,
[03:07:36.733 --> 03:07:40.194]  For the worker, the same way that we have those protections here in this country.
[03:07:40.654 --> 03:07:45.736]  Or let's say you have it through being able to vote people out or being able to choose to buy something else.
[03:07:46.076 --> 03:07:47.376]  We don't have that over there.
[03:07:47.656 --> 03:07:53.098]  So those corporations, those globalist corporations, were able to offshore your labor.
[03:07:53.118 --> 03:07:54.979]  Okay, now we're paying a tax there.
[03:07:55.019 --> 03:07:55.679]  We're getting hit there.
[03:07:55.719 --> 03:07:56.939]  The cost of living is rising.
[03:07:56.959 --> 03:07:58.680]  The inflation is starting to bubble.
[03:07:59.241 --> 03:08:07.507]  Now we take our military there to protect the national interests of trade, global trade, free trade, and now we're subsidizing that country through military.
[03:08:08.468 --> 03:08:21.597]  And then when those despots and warlords and autocrats and all these other people who we say we have no ideological alignment with, compatibility with, when those people
[03:08:22.498 --> 03:08:31.562]  Take all of the profit for themselves and don't spread it amongst the people, because they don't have those concepts of we the people everywhere in the world.
[03:08:32.402 --> 03:08:39.485]  When they take their greedy palms and try and covet all of the wealth for themselves, they send their people out of their country.
[03:08:40.505 --> 03:08:42.026]  Yeah, their people are leaving their country.
[03:08:42.046 --> 03:08:43.026]  They're saying, well, wait a second.
[03:08:43.647 --> 03:08:45.948]  We got American jobs and companies coming to our country.
[03:08:45.988 --> 03:08:49.008]  We can buy McDonald's, but I'm still living well below the poverty line.
[03:08:49.048 --> 03:08:50.328]  I gotta eat crickets.
[03:08:50.408 --> 03:08:56.530]  I'm coming from an Asian country, and I got the rats on a rotisserie there in New York City.
[03:08:56.570 --> 03:09:01.731]  We can talk about the dogs and cats, but nobody brings up the Asian woman there on a New York City street.
[03:09:02.771 --> 03:09:07.412]  And she's got those big, big New York City sewer rats on a rotisserie, okay?
[03:09:07.812 --> 03:09:11.453]  We don't talk about that, but that's what happens when people leave their country.
[03:09:12.253 --> 03:09:14.815]  That we ran a Ponzi scheme and they show up at your borders.
[03:09:15.556 --> 03:09:26.645]  And when they come to your borders, your government, the same people who set up this economic structure, tell them you should accept these individuals into your community and not just that, you should pay for it.
[03:09:29.287 --> 03:09:30.228]  You should pay.
[03:09:31.449 --> 03:09:35.893]  You should pay for these people to come live in your neighborhood.
[03:09:37.574 --> 03:09:38.635]  That is a Ponzi scheme.
[03:09:39.102 --> 03:09:42.524]  That is what you would call economic imperialism.
[03:09:43.064 --> 03:09:47.747]  This is what our founding fathers revolted against the British Empire for.
[03:09:47.787 --> 03:09:49.168]  And it's the British Empire's globe.
[03:09:49.228 --> 03:09:51.129]  It's the British Empire's business model.
[03:09:52.930 --> 03:09:58.674]  And as history goes again, when you really think of it, we just adopted the British Empire's business model.
[03:09:59.274 --> 03:10:01.075]  We're shilling for the crown still to this day.
[03:10:01.115 --> 03:10:02.096]  Look at all of our wars.
[03:10:02.536 --> 03:10:03.597]  Look at our foreign policy.
[03:10:03.637 --> 03:10:05.918]  Our foreign policy is British foreign policy.
[03:10:06.946 --> 03:10:15.673]  Look at the Indo-Pacific, or what they used to call the Sino-Japanese theater.
[03:10:16.253 --> 03:10:17.454]  That's British foreign policy.
[03:10:18.695 --> 03:10:21.597]  The heartland Ukraine and Russia, that's British foreign policy.
[03:10:23.318 --> 03:10:26.621]  Israel and Palestine, the entire Middle East theater, that's British foreign policy.
[03:10:26.641 --> 03:10:27.742]  It's got nothing to do with us.
[03:10:28.843 --> 03:10:29.683]  We're not European.
[03:10:30.404 --> 03:10:31.024]  We're not British.
[03:10:31.725 --> 03:10:33.886]  I know a lot of people fancy themselves British or European.
[03:10:33.906 --> 03:10:34.487]  You're not British.
[03:10:35.413 --> 03:10:36.195]  I'm not African.
[03:10:36.616 --> 03:10:37.097]  I'm black.
[03:10:37.839 --> 03:10:38.962]  If you're white out there, you're white.
[03:10:38.982 --> 03:10:40.325]  There's nothing wrong with being white or black.
[03:10:40.506 --> 03:10:41.168]  You're American.
[03:10:41.609 --> 03:10:42.371]  But you're not British.
[03:10:42.491 --> 03:10:43.253]  And I'm not African.
[03:10:44.181 --> 03:10:58.344]  And this entire idea, and this is where race was like this, race and heritage and ethnicity and nationality and that whole kind of shell game that gets played with those conversations in political circles.
[03:10:58.564 --> 03:11:05.985]  This is where that was used as a Trojan horse to justify you having some allegiance to some country that has nothing to do with your immediate cost or quality of life.
[03:11:10.646 --> 03:11:12.266]  I hope I explained that the right way.
[03:11:13.114 --> 03:11:15.218]  We're going to be talking about that on the other side of the break.
[03:11:16.841 --> 03:11:18.765]  I'm Royce White, your guest host for this hour.
[03:11:19.045 --> 03:11:20.328]  I appreciate being here.
[03:11:21.149 --> 03:11:23.013]  Thank you to the entire InfoWars audience.
[03:11:23.414 --> 03:11:23.995]  Stay tuned.
[03:11:24.932 --> 03:11:25.973]  We're coming back in a moment.
[03:11:26.353 --> 03:11:30.035]  This bad boy is the number one seller at the alexjonestore.com.
[03:11:30.275 --> 03:11:33.136]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:11:33.576 --> 03:11:34.197]  Folks love it.
[03:11:34.397 --> 03:11:34.777]  I love it.
[03:11:34.797 --> 03:11:42.441]  I love wearing this out in public and it also lets the globals to let us know we are standing up against them and we know who they serve and we know who we serve.
[03:11:42.601 --> 03:11:52.846]  The black rock globalist controlled left from academia to the media is obsessed with bullying you into silence because their ideas are illegal and unpopular.
[03:11:53.086 --> 03:11:54.967]  And if you simply speak up, it's game over.
[03:11:55.287 --> 03:11:59.030]  So stop thinking it's just Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Donald Trump to save the world.
[03:11:59.290 --> 03:12:00.310]  It's all of us together.
[03:12:00.591 --> 03:12:03.132]  And wearing t-shirts in public that promote freedom is key.
[03:12:03.152 --> 03:12:04.913]  It doesn't just show our enemies we're awake.
[03:12:05.314 --> 03:12:08.596]  Other people see it and realize how popular freedom is.
[03:12:09.016 --> 03:12:10.837]  So ladies and gentlemen, it's a win-win.
[03:12:11.137 --> 03:12:17.141]  Get great shirts at thealexshowstore.com, fund the operations, we fight the tyrants at point blank range, and
[03:12:26.325 --> 03:12:28.165]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:28.426 --> 03:12:31.827]  I'm your host, Royce White, here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:12:32.547 --> 03:12:34.688]  And I'm happy to be with you this afternoon.
[03:12:34.748 --> 03:12:40.210]  It's always a great honor to be able to host the Alex Jones Show, the Incredible Infowars audience.
[03:12:40.250 --> 03:12:46.393]  And I meet people all the time across the campaign trail, across the state of Minnesota, across this great nation that say,
[03:12:47.133 --> 03:12:48.394]  I saw you on Alex Jones.
[03:12:48.474 --> 03:12:49.774]  I saw you hosting InfoWars.
[03:12:49.794 --> 03:12:50.995]  I heard you hosting InfoWars.
[03:12:51.055 --> 03:13:05.623]  It warms my heart because, like I said in the last segment, the mainstream media, from day one, you go back and you read the New York Times article after I won the endorsement here for the statewide Republican convention in Minnesota.
[03:13:07.124 --> 03:13:13.427]  The two people that they connected me to in the opening paragraph were Alex Jones and Steve Bannon for a reason.
[03:13:14.079 --> 03:13:17.241]  Because, I mean, they're the two spearheads of the movement, intellectually.
[03:13:17.761 --> 03:13:27.706]  Intellectually, they are the two railheads of this American nationalist, populist, ultra-MAGA movement.
[03:13:28.506 --> 03:13:30.247]  And I'm honored.
[03:13:30.687 --> 03:13:32.088]  I mean, what could I say?
[03:13:32.228 --> 03:13:33.268]  I mean, I just smiled.
[03:13:33.628 --> 03:13:35.169]  It was a hit piece, for sure.
[03:13:35.449 --> 03:13:37.010]  It was an op-ed.
[03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:39.851]  You can't even write an op-ed in the New York Times unless you're in on the grift.
[03:13:41.781 --> 03:13:42.521]  It was a hit piece.
[03:13:42.581 --> 03:13:44.282]  You know, they said I said women are too mouthy.
[03:13:44.302 --> 03:13:44.902]  And this is funny.
[03:13:44.942 --> 03:13:45.943]  This is a beautiful segue.
[03:13:45.963 --> 03:13:49.344]  I don't I don't usually do shows with notes because I just let the truth spill out.
[03:13:49.404 --> 03:14:03.450]  But this is a beautiful segue because the reason I started the last segment off with the young woman who is, you know, suffering from that that that economic and monetary policy of our government and the corruption of our corporate and globalist elites.
[03:14:03.470 --> 03:14:09.593]  The reason I ran that clip is because if I had to make an educated guess, I would say she's probably voting for Kamala Harris.
[03:14:10.546 --> 03:14:22.690]  Now, hopefully she ends up watching this and understanding that a vote for Kamala Harris, a vote for any of these Democrats, and some of the Republicans as well, would be a vote for the very system that's put her in the circumstance she's in and the condition she's in.
[03:14:23.510 --> 03:14:24.350]  And how do they do that?
[03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:27.991]  How do they continue to trick these people into voting against their own self-interest?
[03:14:28.071 --> 03:14:29.372]  It's very, very simple.
[03:14:30.572 --> 03:14:32.633]  Cultural wedge issues.
[03:14:33.493 --> 03:14:35.054]  WWE politics.
[03:14:35.354 --> 03:14:36.094]  That's what they do.
[03:14:36.134 --> 03:14:37.174]  That's their go-to move.
[03:14:37.914 --> 03:14:39.635]  You're black, you're a woman, you're gay.
[03:14:40.242 --> 03:14:46.345]  Or you're trans, or you're trans species, or you're Furby, or Furry, or whatever they got going on now.
[03:14:46.385 --> 03:14:48.386]  I mean, it's getting completely off the rails.
[03:14:48.406 --> 03:14:50.527]  I don't even know how we got to this place.
[03:14:50.547 --> 03:14:55.529]  In fact, some days I wake up, and if I wasn't Christian, I think, we're probably in a simulation.
[03:14:55.849 --> 03:14:58.651]  But I'm Christian, so I just can't let my spirit go there.
[03:14:58.951 --> 03:15:04.754]  Point being is, that was the impulse of the article that the New York Times wrote.
[03:15:04.794 --> 03:15:07.775]  They said, Royce White says women have gotten too mouthy.
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:14.982]  Well, if I'm a man, first of all, there are a lot of women out there who have gotten mouthy.
[03:15:15.282 --> 03:15:16.042]  That's just a fact.
[03:15:16.703 --> 03:15:19.864]  And they're probably going to clip this now because the Deep State's watching everything I do.
[03:15:20.204 --> 03:15:29.187]  Because a majority in the Senate, and even furthermore, an actual American nationalist ultramagic candidate in the Senate could be a very big problem.
[03:15:29.267 --> 03:15:33.228]  So if they can clip an interview or soundbite for me and use it against me, they'll do it.
[03:15:33.288 --> 03:15:33.568]  Good.
[03:15:33.809 --> 03:15:34.049]  Fine.
[03:15:34.069 --> 03:15:35.309]  Well, make sure you run the whole clip.
[03:15:36.049 --> 03:15:37.630]  The whole clip says, yes,
[03:15:38.520 --> 03:15:41.201]  There are some women who have gotten mouthy and they are women.
[03:15:42.421 --> 03:15:43.662]  There are a lot of mouthy men too.
[03:15:44.602 --> 03:15:46.763]  And yes, the ones who are mouthy are men.
[03:15:47.163 --> 03:15:50.604]  So it's completely reasonable to describe both categories as they are.
[03:15:51.244 --> 03:16:00.707]  I know many of these people would like us to do away with categories altogether, which is strange when you go back to tell women they should vote for you, even though we can't really say what a woman is anymore.
[03:16:00.807 --> 03:16:04.188]  I know that's kind of one of the cliches, but it is one of the most ridiculous
[03:16:05.265 --> 03:16:08.506]  Norms that's creeping into the American political culture.
[03:16:09.446 --> 03:16:12.486]  We can talk about gender and identity when it's advantageous for us.
[03:16:12.506 --> 03:16:15.447]  When it's not, we don't want any gender identity whatsoever.
[03:16:15.887 --> 03:16:16.667]  That is strange.
[03:16:16.707 --> 03:16:17.127]  It's odd.
[03:16:17.167 --> 03:16:18.568]  It's really strange that we would accept it.
[03:16:18.608 --> 03:16:21.528]  But hey, point being is this.
[03:16:24.129 --> 03:16:25.169]  Women have gotten mouthy.
[03:16:26.569 --> 03:16:28.530]  Some women, not all women, but some women.
[03:16:29.170 --> 03:16:34.811]  In fact, if men can't bring facts to bear in our politics,
[03:16:35.999 --> 03:16:59.194]  In our cultural conversations, in the conversations about money and economics, if we can't bring facts to bear, because you're a woman, and you're going to call us, I don't know, fascist, crazy, they call me knuckle-dragger, coon, whatever else.
[03:16:59.415 --> 03:17:02.957]  If you're going to call us these things because we're trying to bring facts to bear,
[03:17:04.025 --> 03:17:09.908]  I think that would reasonably qualify as being mouthy.
[03:17:10.568 --> 03:17:10.769]  Yeah.
[03:17:10.929 --> 03:17:11.749]  What does mouthy mean?
[03:17:11.789 --> 03:17:16.191]  Mouthy means a tendency to talk too much, especially with impudence.
[03:17:17.052 --> 03:17:28.017]  And it is very impudent for anybody, man, woman, or child, to use cultural identity as a way to stifle bringing facts to bear on the conversation.
[03:17:28.097 --> 03:17:31.759]  That is the epitome of impudence.
[03:17:31.999 --> 03:17:32.960]  It's very childish.
[03:17:33.467 --> 03:17:37.089]  In fact, if one of the three groups were going to be able to do it, you would expect it from the children.
[03:17:37.629 --> 03:17:39.991]  But when you're a good parent, you don't even really let your children do it.
[03:17:40.051 --> 03:17:42.632]  That's part of helping them grow up and mature the right way.
[03:17:42.992 --> 03:17:45.614]  We've lost a lot of that in this country for obvious reasons.
[03:17:45.674 --> 03:17:47.675]  But again, that is impudent.
[03:17:48.315 --> 03:17:54.699]  Don't tell me because you're a woman or black or gay that it should transcend the facts that bear on the conversation.
[03:17:55.419 --> 03:18:01.603]  And the fact is Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama
[03:18:02.262 --> 03:18:22.046]  And the Bushes, and Dick and Liz Cheney, and the Romneys, and John McCain, and many others, they are the puppets who have always served the corrupt status quo of this post-World War II democratic liberal order, and the economic and monetary policy that's laid underneath it.
[03:18:22.886 --> 03:18:24.006]  They are the vanguards.
[03:18:25.307 --> 03:18:29.087]  So for them to tell you that things are going to get better for you, if you vote for them,
[03:18:32.842 --> 03:18:33.282]  Stupid.
[03:18:34.343 --> 03:18:36.184]  But for you to believe it, it's twice as stupid.
[03:18:36.744 --> 03:18:40.767]  There is no way they're going to change the status quo.
[03:18:41.327 --> 03:18:44.789]  They're going to find a way to rebrand it and repackage it, put a new face on it.
[03:18:44.809 --> 03:18:48.671]  That new face will tell you, I just got here, give me some time.
[03:18:49.732 --> 03:18:50.953]  That's what they're going to do with Kamala.
[03:18:51.293 --> 03:18:58.677]  When you're looking at Kamala Harris, you are looking at the post-World War II Democrat-Liberal order all the way back to George Bush Sr.
[03:19:00.618 --> 03:19:01.999]  So how much more time do they get?
[03:19:03.044 --> 03:19:07.287]  The post-World War II Democratic-Liberal order has failed this country.
[03:19:08.228 --> 03:19:09.489]  It has failed this country.
[03:19:09.529 --> 03:19:11.050]  It has failed black people.
[03:19:11.370 --> 03:19:12.331]  It has failed women.
[03:19:14.633 --> 03:19:16.054]  Look at the economics.
[03:19:17.275 --> 03:19:20.057]  The economics of it are a house of cards.
[03:19:21.037 --> 03:19:24.280]  Now, does America have great economic viability?
[03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:25.781]  Absolutely it does.
[03:19:26.658 --> 03:19:27.559]  But what needs to happen?
[03:19:27.579 --> 03:19:29.000]  We have to build some things.
[03:19:29.020 --> 03:19:30.201]  We have to make our own essentials.
[03:19:30.481 --> 03:19:37.106]  We can't let our national mortal enemy make our antibiotics, our tires, and the bushings for our fighter jets.
[03:19:38.467 --> 03:19:44.271]  We've sold the entire essential manufacturing base of our country out to our national mortal enemy.
[03:19:46.552 --> 03:19:48.093]  And they have no plans on stopping.
[03:19:48.734 --> 03:19:50.475]  They have no plans on turning that around.
[03:19:51.156 --> 03:19:55.599]  They plan to start a few wars to tell you they want to change it, like the port there in Gaza.
[03:19:56.229 --> 03:20:02.914]  Yeah, no, now we're going to run a pipeline from India all the way through up to Gaza, and this is going to be the workaround for OPEC?
[03:20:03.474 --> 03:20:12.521]  Ronald Reagan was criticizing OPEC and the need for foreign oil and energy back when he ran for office, back when George Bush Sr.
[03:20:12.561 --> 03:20:13.182]  primaried him.
[03:20:13.302 --> 03:20:14.262]  Let's not forget that.
[03:20:14.883 --> 03:20:16.864]  Let's not forget that George Bush Sr.
[03:20:16.944 --> 03:20:20.847]  primaried Ronald Reagan, who all these Republicans hold up as a saintly figure.
[03:20:21.508 --> 03:20:22.408]  George Bush Sr.
[03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:25.791]  primaried him in his re-election.
[03:20:28.092 --> 03:20:28.753]  Everybody remember that.
[03:20:29.774 --> 03:20:30.554]  He primaried him.
[03:20:30.594 --> 03:20:44.107]  And then he knew he wasn't gonna win, but he stayed until the end to try and vie for a vice president position, which eventually ended up working because Ronald Reagan was such a nice guy.
[03:20:44.147 --> 03:20:49.733]  He didn't want the Republican Party to be split, especially since he wasn't a stalwart of the Republican Party himself.
[03:20:49.773 --> 03:20:51.154]  He had come from the Democrat Party.
[03:20:51.644 --> 03:21:02.568]  So I'm sure you had a bunch of vipers and snakes around him who told him, hey, for the betterment of the party that you're new to, it'd be a good thing not to have this great split between you and Bush.
[03:21:02.588 --> 03:21:05.109]  And there you find Bush in the vice presidency.
[03:21:06.869 --> 03:21:10.391]  And wasn't it Ronald Reagan that got shot in the stomach?
[03:21:12.831 --> 03:21:14.212]  Yeah, he talked about OPEC and
[03:21:14.628 --> 03:21:25.596]  And energy independence and the gold standard and how important American manufacturing and how important American energy independence really was in the grand scheme of things.
[03:21:26.157 --> 03:21:27.518]  And then he took a bullet in the stomach.
[03:21:27.878 --> 03:21:28.619]  Sound familiar?
[03:21:30.200 --> 03:21:31.321]  It feels familiar.
[03:21:33.082 --> 03:21:37.766]  I'm not going to make any, you know, I'm not going to make any
[03:21:38.604 --> 03:21:40.165]  Inferences as to what happened.
[03:21:40.586 --> 03:21:56.539]  But every time you start to talk about the root causes of issues in this country, every time you start to talk about the root problems, and you get down to the bone or the gristle of what's really going on, every time somebody ends up getting shot.
[03:21:59.521 --> 03:22:04.705]  That's just the way that things, and who was there to step up when Ronald Reagan resigned?
[03:22:04.765 --> 03:22:05.586]  I'm just saying.
[03:22:06.308 --> 03:22:08.789]  There are no conspiracies, but there are no coincidences.
[03:22:09.709 --> 03:22:16.692]  And if you go to my Wikipedia, if you're in the studio, could you please pull up... I'm glad I'm on Alex Jones today.
[03:22:16.892 --> 03:22:20.013]  I meant to send Alex this screenshot.
[03:22:20.393 --> 03:22:23.854]  Can you go to my Wikipedia page, please, there in the studio?
[03:22:23.894 --> 03:22:25.235]  Just pull up my Wikipedia page.
[03:22:25.255 --> 03:22:26.015]  There's something I'm really...
[03:22:26.661 --> 03:22:31.882]  Really proud of here that Wikipedia has done since I won the primary.
[03:22:32.143 --> 03:22:33.863]  Can you zoom in there on the top line?
[03:22:34.343 --> 03:22:38.624]  I mean, this is being right over the target, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:22:40.025 --> 03:22:41.605]  Yeah, go right up there to the top line.
[03:22:41.805 --> 03:22:42.746]  Right there, the first line.
[03:22:42.786 --> 03:22:49.367]  Royce Alexander White, born April 10, 1991, is an American conspiracy theorist.
[03:22:50.048 --> 03:22:51.448]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:22:51.908 --> 03:22:52.828]  I've joined the club.
[03:22:52.868 --> 03:22:53.949]  For all of you who say, hey,
[03:22:55.416 --> 03:22:56.978]  Royce White might be a plan.
[03:22:57.098 --> 03:23:01.882]  Alex Jones might be a deep state plan.
[03:23:04.324 --> 03:23:08.808]  They don't call you an American conspiracy theorist on places like Wikipedia if you're in on the scam.
[03:23:09.129 --> 03:23:11.071]  That's not how things generally work.
[03:23:11.311 --> 03:23:19.999]  How things generally work is they give you people like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney.
[03:23:21.417 --> 03:23:26.181]  And Romney, and McCain, and Lindsey Graham, and I could go down the long list.
[03:23:26.701 --> 03:23:33.428]  Steve Daines, out there in Montana, chairman of the NRSC, Rhino extraordinaire, Steve Daines.
[03:23:34.148 --> 03:23:38.232]  They give you people like this who stand as the outer bastion of that new world order.
[03:23:39.053 --> 03:23:45.679]  And they may fluff your feathers around certain cultural wedge issues, but the reality is when push comes to shove, they throw in with the communists.
[03:23:46.443 --> 03:23:48.905]  And you see right now that they've thrown in with the communists.
[03:23:49.205 --> 03:23:56.190]  And while I'm not trying to make this an Israel AIPAC thing, what I will say is this.
[03:23:57.431 --> 03:23:58.192]  It is interesting.
[03:23:59.213 --> 03:24:11.842]  It is interesting to find that AIPAC supports both my opponent, Amy Klobuchar, and Steve Daines, one of my detractors there in the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
[03:24:13.300 --> 03:24:20.886]  Who as chair, you know, refuses to offer any support here in my race in Minnesota to win back a majority.
[03:24:20.926 --> 03:24:29.973]  It's almost as if, if the majority of the Senate was going to come down to Minnesota and it'd be me or Amy Klobuchar, they would much rather Amy Klobuchar win.
[03:24:30.013 --> 03:24:31.874]  And that is the definition of the uniparty.
[03:24:31.894 --> 03:24:38.920]  And if you look at AIPAC, AIPAC is the shining beacon of uniparty politics in this country.
[03:24:39.580 --> 03:24:40.301]  Why do I say that?
[03:24:40.821 --> 03:24:42.963]  Well, just functionally, they're on both sides of the aisle.
[03:24:43.931 --> 03:24:45.953]  I mean, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:24:46.633 --> 03:24:48.435]  You show me another lobby that's more effective.
[03:24:48.455 --> 03:24:51.318]  Number one, there isn't another lobby that's more effective.
[03:24:51.398 --> 03:24:52.499]  That's a fundamental fact.
[03:24:52.919 --> 03:24:53.660]  That's on paper.
[03:24:53.720 --> 03:24:56.202]  Everybody can agree to those set of facts, I hope.
[03:24:56.642 --> 03:24:58.824]  If not, I don't know what game you're playing.
[03:25:00.045 --> 03:25:02.487]  But AIPAC is the most effective lobby in this country.
[03:25:03.368 --> 03:25:04.689]  And they're on both sides of the aisle.
[03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:08.252]  You show me another lobby as effective that's on both sides of the aisle.
[03:25:08.293 --> 03:25:10.775]  If you show me one, I guarantee you they will be
[03:25:11.554 --> 03:25:16.818]  Fundamentally interested in the business model of drugs, piracy, and slavery.
[03:25:18.680 --> 03:25:19.880]  And that is the status quo.
[03:25:19.960 --> 03:25:21.021]  That's what we're upholding.
[03:25:21.662 --> 03:25:26.045]  That's what the post-World War II democratic liberal order and its uniparty politicians are upholding.
[03:25:26.065 --> 03:25:28.007]  They're defending that world order.
[03:25:29.708 --> 03:25:36.373]  That's how you get a Dick Cheney throwing in with Kamala Harris, and they openly accept his support.
[03:25:37.836 --> 03:25:40.138]  Since when did you Democrats started hanging out?
[03:25:40.438 --> 03:25:51.048]  Since when did you Democrats start a war for my own profit, Dick Cheney?
[03:25:52.629 --> 03:25:56.292]  Well, all you got to do is go back and look at the constituency that elected Liz.
[03:25:57.093 --> 03:25:58.474]  And you start to ask questions of them.
[03:25:58.955 --> 03:26:01.657]  And you find out it's turtles all the way down.
[03:26:02.355 --> 03:26:05.356]  We have a deep, deep crisis in this country, political crisis.
[03:26:05.376 --> 03:26:07.397]  And that's why I decided to run for United States Senate.
[03:26:07.717 --> 03:26:09.338]  I'm not selling you any false dreams.
[03:26:09.378 --> 03:26:15.761]  I'm not telling you, telling you if I get in the Senate, that the Senate majority is going to reflect the will of the people and be America first.
[03:26:16.121 --> 03:26:20.943]  I can't count ten America first United States senators on the Republican side.
[03:26:22.383 --> 03:26:23.044]  That's the truth.
[03:26:24.544 --> 03:26:30.887]  I'll probably be in a fight on the Republican side just as much as the Democrat side if I make it there to Washington, but that's exactly what you need.
[03:26:31.866 --> 03:26:34.667]  And if you don't understand that, then you don't understand what's going on here.
[03:26:35.767 --> 03:26:49.530]  If you don't understand the way that the United Party has a vice grip on America and the cost and quality of your life, and they play with it like their own little personal game, jigsaw puzzle.
[03:26:49.570 --> 03:26:54.911]  If you don't understand that, then I don't really care to hear you talk about politics because you don't know what you're talking about.
[03:26:55.886 --> 03:26:58.307]  You don't get the game, the fundamental of the game.
[03:26:58.347 --> 03:27:02.229]  When you play basketball, the point of the game is to score more points than the other team.
[03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:19.639]  Okay, well, in this game, this game of American politics, where we are right now, as we the people, we are facing a two-pronged, two-party, uniparty that has a grip on American politics and the institutions, and they mean to subvert American freedom.
[03:27:19.679 --> 03:27:20.199]  That's the game.
[03:27:20.876 --> 03:27:23.237]  You can accept it or not, it doesn't really matter much to me.
[03:27:23.497 --> 03:27:28.178]  They can call me a conspiracy theorist if they want to, but the reality is Apex on both sides of the aisle.
[03:27:28.439 --> 03:27:31.600]  Look at the people who support, and let me ask the Republicans this out there.
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:40.843]  Does your love of Israel, you on the Christian right, you evangelicals, does your love of Israel so deep?
[03:27:43.063 --> 03:27:47.145]  Do you have such an affection for Israel that you are willing to
[03:27:48.095 --> 03:27:53.578]  Be economically aligned with or attached to communists?
[03:27:55.219 --> 03:27:56.340]  You gotta ask yourself that.
[03:27:56.820 --> 03:28:02.144]  I mean, we gotta get right down to the brass tack of what's going on here.
[03:28:03.144 --> 03:28:12.530]  I mean, never out of my Christian identity could I justify being economically aligned and in partnership with communists, with satanists,
[03:28:13.260 --> 03:28:14.561]  And the communists were satanists.
[03:28:14.602 --> 03:28:20.768]  Never forget, anybody who tells you that Marxism, Socialism, and Communism are three separate things, they're lying to you.
[03:28:21.369 --> 03:28:23.131]  They're all from the same intellectual tradition.
[03:28:24.152 --> 03:28:31.800]  They're the pipe dream, the socio-political, cultural pipe dream of Karl Marx and all of his accomplices.
[03:28:32.281 --> 03:28:33.202]  And they were satanists!
[03:28:34.201 --> 03:28:45.156]  I mean, you can go right there in the history and read Karl Marx's early poetry where he talks about the Faustian bargain and having this obsession with the metaphysical character known as Mephistopheles.
[03:28:48.615 --> 03:28:49.275]  Who was a demon.
[03:28:49.755 --> 03:28:51.256]  Yeah, Mephistopheles was a demon.
[03:28:51.696 --> 03:28:54.417]  Pull up Mephistopheles there on Wikipedia if you can.
[03:28:54.437 --> 03:28:59.179]  You know, some of it they hide in plain sight, but they never connect the dots.
[03:28:59.199 --> 03:29:10.224]  Yeah, Karl Marx and many of his other friends at the time were obsessed with Mephistopheles who wanted to raise existence itself to the ground because they had that much contempt for God.
[03:29:11.344 --> 03:29:17.587]  That if they couldn't become God, if they couldn't bridge the gap between themselves and God, then they would much rather see existence cease.
[03:29:19.272 --> 03:29:23.295]  A profound, a profound nihilism.
[03:29:24.756 --> 03:29:25.337]  Profound.
[03:29:27.678 --> 03:29:31.621]  Biblical proportions, literally, that type of rejection of God.
[03:29:32.942 --> 03:29:37.566]  But those were the thought leaders and architects of communism, and Marxism, and socialism.
[03:29:38.366 --> 03:29:39.968]  And so again, I go back to my point.
[03:29:40.448 --> 03:29:47.073]  In what world are you evangelical Christians so obsessed with your love for Israel,
[03:29:47.884 --> 03:29:54.225]  That you're willing to do a deal, a Faustian bargain, with the communists and satanists?
[03:29:55.445 --> 03:30:01.127]  How is it that an AIPAC can support both Speaker Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries?
[03:30:02.987 --> 03:30:08.268]  How is it that Hakeem Jeffries and Mike Johnson find alignment on anything?
[03:30:09.908 --> 03:30:10.228]  One thing.
[03:30:11.108 --> 03:30:13.229]  One thing out of everything they find alignment on.
[03:30:13.729 --> 03:30:14.149]  One thing.
[03:30:15.368 --> 03:30:17.550]  You get them in a room about any other set of issues.
[03:30:17.610 --> 03:30:22.474]  They can't agree that the sky is blue and that the Earth is round.
[03:30:22.734 --> 03:30:24.276]  They can't agree on anything else.
[03:30:25.697 --> 03:30:30.801]  But if you get them at an AIPAC speaking engagement, everybody's hugs and kisses.
[03:30:31.922 --> 03:30:32.282]  Okay.
[03:30:33.063 --> 03:30:34.604]  Okay, call me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:30:34.804 --> 03:30:35.765]  I find a problem with that.
[03:30:35.945 --> 03:30:37.667]  I say it's a conflict of interest.
[03:30:37.727 --> 03:30:43.972]  And my saying it's a conflict of interest is not to denounce Israel.
[03:30:44.873 --> 03:30:47.375]  It's not to make a statement about Israel or the Jews at all.
[03:30:47.415 --> 03:30:50.157]  The question is, where are the boundaries?
[03:30:50.257 --> 03:30:54.040]  Where are the ethical boundaries of political allegiance and fealty?
[03:30:55.622 --> 03:30:57.203]  We have to sort that out right now.
[03:30:58.824 --> 03:31:04.869]  And how is it that the American Israel Political Action Committee
[03:31:06.149 --> 03:31:15.253]  Finds alignment with the same Democrats who use the grassroots momentum of people who fundamentally reject the legitimacy of Israel itself.
[03:31:18.335 --> 03:31:20.356]  Somebody tell me, drop it in the comments.
[03:31:21.576 --> 03:31:22.517]  I'm having trouble here.
[03:31:23.057 --> 03:31:29.360]  I'm just as you go back to that Wikipedia page, I'm just the first United States Senate nominee
[03:31:30.177 --> 03:31:32.919]  in our nation's history to be born in the 1990s.
[03:31:33.059 --> 03:31:34.620]  And I'm proud of it.
[03:31:34.660 --> 03:31:40.963]  And maybe because I'm from the 90s, maybe because I was born in the 90s, maybe I got a little, maybe I'm a little messed up in the head, you know?
[03:31:42.204 --> 03:31:42.824]  Can you blame me?
[03:31:43.185 --> 03:31:52.450]  I mean, I grew up under this weird, strange, kabuki, neocon boomer culture.
[03:31:52.730 --> 03:31:55.552]  So, you know, maybe we're all a little screwy in the mind.
[03:31:56.132 --> 03:31:58.473]  But I'll be the one to say it.
[03:31:58.834 --> 03:31:59.334]  I don't mind.
[03:32:00.385 --> 03:32:05.008]  I don't mind being the one to say it, because ultimately it doesn't matter if I win or lose.
[03:32:05.048 --> 03:32:07.129]  What matters is if the American people win or lose.
[03:32:07.149 --> 03:32:11.091]  And if we're going to win as the people, we the people, it's not going to be about me.
[03:32:11.952 --> 03:32:18.756]  It'd be a great first step to have somebody there in the United States Senate who's willing to tell the truth and isn't bought by anyone.
[03:32:20.109 --> 03:32:32.431]  Who only has $150,000 worth of donations, not because I couldn't assign my soul away to the military-industrial complex or some other group of foreign interests or some group of domestic interests.
[03:32:33.052 --> 03:32:33.932]  We know it's out there.
[03:32:34.552 --> 03:32:41.253]  And all you have to do, all you have to do to find out who's selling you out is you go look at these politicians and you look at their money.
[03:32:41.393 --> 03:32:42.673]  You look at their contributions.
[03:32:42.973 --> 03:32:44.094]  You look at where it's coming from.
[03:32:44.354 --> 03:32:45.634]  You go look at Amy Klobuchar.
[03:32:46.519 --> 03:32:49.461]  You go look at her $18 million war chest that she's raised.
[03:32:50.061 --> 03:32:54.024]  $18 million, a three-term incumbent, and she only has $6 million cash on hand.
[03:32:54.224 --> 03:32:59.127]  Where do you think the $12 million went, just for starters?
[03:32:59.187 --> 03:33:02.509]  To win her re-election campaigns that she wins by a landslide anyway?
[03:33:04.110 --> 03:33:05.230]  In a liberal stronghold?
[03:33:05.350 --> 03:33:06.211]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[03:33:07.509 --> 03:33:15.634]  Even that little bit of money they're spreading around, but that's pennies compared to the trillions of dollars that get traded based on her loyalty there in the Senate.
[03:33:15.935 --> 03:33:18.496]  And it's not just her, it's her and Steve Daines alike.
[03:33:19.037 --> 03:33:25.601]  And every year there's $4 trillion to divvy up, about $6 trillion now.
[03:33:25.661 --> 03:33:34.727]  But usually there's about $2 trillion on either side of the fiscal budget that everybody there in DC gets to divvy up and kick out to their special interests, wherever that is.
[03:33:36.539 --> 03:33:37.599]  Money gang, follow the money.
[03:33:37.619 --> 03:33:44.823]  $2 trillion for Medicare and Medicaid, and $2 trillion for the military-industrial complex.
[03:33:44.843 --> 03:33:52.026]  The Democrats take the Medicaid and Medicare racket, the Republicans and neocons, they take the military-industrial complex.
[03:33:54.227 --> 03:33:55.167]  You want to help Israel?
[03:33:56.087 --> 03:34:04.491]  Let's help Israel by not trapping them in a deal, where we are the sole manufacturer of their weapons, where they have to buy their weapons from America.
[03:34:05.071 --> 03:34:06.692]  What kind of Ponzi scheme is that?
[03:34:06.732 --> 03:34:07.733]  What kind of racket is that?
[03:34:08.154 --> 03:34:09.615]  What kind of moral racket is that?
[03:34:13.378 --> 03:34:15.760]  They can't manufacture their own weapons?
[03:34:16.240 --> 03:34:18.462]  And they were manufacturing their own weapons.
[03:34:18.662 --> 03:34:24.607]  And Barack Obama signed a 10-year agreement that along with our support would mean that we were the sole manufacturer of their weapons.
[03:34:26.957 --> 03:34:28.058]  And so they have to wait on us.
[03:34:28.158 --> 03:34:35.382]  So then when Joe Biden doesn't want to give them whatever support they say that they need to fight whatever war they decide they want, why are we entangled in it?
[03:34:36.683 --> 03:34:41.645]  There are plenty of people there in Israel who say we want to be able to manufacture our own weapons, but they don't feel that they can.
[03:34:41.966 --> 03:34:44.127]  My point is, you see how the game really go?
[03:34:44.327 --> 03:34:45.988]  The game is played at such a level.
[03:34:46.949 --> 03:34:49.750]  I'm not here to tell you that I'm going to change it.
[03:34:49.890 --> 03:34:51.271]  I'm here to tell you I'll fight for you.
[03:34:52.168 --> 03:35:01.472]  I'm here to tell you if I'm in the United States Senate before we raise the debt ceiling another penny, I'll stand up there and filibuster for 30 days straight if need be.
[03:35:02.652 --> 03:35:09.135]  I'll fly Alex Jones in to come in and I'll invite him into the Senate floor to talk to me and give me some moral support.
[03:35:09.615 --> 03:35:10.816]  And we will filibuster.
[03:35:10.976 --> 03:35:13.057]  I don't even know if that's legal, if they would actually allow that.
[03:35:13.997 --> 03:35:16.558]  I just said that jokingly, okay?
[03:35:16.658 --> 03:35:17.499]  That's a joke.
[03:35:19.778 --> 03:35:23.800]  I will filibuster until we restore some order, until we return governance to we the people.
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:35.564]  And what that young woman at the start was saying, what she was saying without knowing she's saying it, is that the post-World War II democratic liberal order has failed these people economically.
[03:35:36.325 --> 03:35:38.606]  And the economic failure is not by accident.
[03:35:39.066 --> 03:35:42.127]  It is by intentional and brilliant design.
[03:35:42.987 --> 03:35:44.328]  You are going to become a serf.
[03:35:45.106 --> 03:35:49.907]  You are going to become a 19th century Russian serf.
[03:35:51.228 --> 03:35:51.928]  You already are.
[03:35:53.368 --> 03:35:53.908]  You already are.
[03:35:53.968 --> 03:36:03.771]  All they're telling you is if we make you feel good about your identity, maybe you won't realize how bad things really are, how unjust things really are, how tyrannical things really are.
[03:36:04.131 --> 03:36:12.893]  Maybe if we make you feel good about being a young black man who wears a dress, you won't really notice what's going on around you.
[03:36:13.033 --> 03:36:13.273]  Psych!
[03:36:15.171 --> 03:36:15.751]  Not gonna work.
[03:36:16.792 --> 03:36:18.653]  Not gonna work on this young black man.
[03:36:18.673 --> 03:36:22.734]  I'm sure there's a bunch you can find who it will work on, but it's not working on me.
[03:36:23.175 --> 03:36:26.836]  Thank you again to Alex Jones, the entire InfoWars crew.
[03:36:26.896 --> 03:36:29.457]  I appreciate your work and your commitment to this country.
[03:36:29.798 --> 03:36:33.039]  Thank you to all you out there, to everyone out there in the audience.
[03:36:33.999 --> 03:36:37.261]  If I meet you out there on the road to save the republic, please say hello.
[03:36:39.062 --> 03:36:40.642]  It's great to have that feedback as well.
[03:36:41.263 --> 03:36:41.963]  I love you all.
[03:36:42.103 --> 03:36:42.863]  I love you, Alex.
[03:36:42.983 --> 03:36:44.044]  Thank you for your leadership.
[03:36:44.659 --> 03:36:45.960]  I hope to see you again soon.
[03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:47.581]  The fight continues.
[03:36:47.601 --> 03:36:48.982]  The people are coming.
[03:36:49.882 --> 03:36:50.382]  Godspeed.
[03:36:51.683 --> 03:36:58.767]  I'm asking viewers to just sit back for a moment and really think about the success InfoWars has had.
[03:36:59.308 --> 03:37:00.448]  And InfoWars isn't just me.
[03:37:00.468 --> 03:37:01.209]  It's not just the crew.
[03:37:01.249 --> 03:37:02.629]  It's not just our guests.
[03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:08.873]  It's all of you, the viewers and listeners that give us intel, that spread the word, that support the broadcast.
[03:37:09.573 --> 03:37:13.636]  In the 30-year history of me being on air and 27 years of InfoWars,
[03:37:14.216 --> 03:37:19.902]  We have changed the world, and because we researched the globalist-owned documents, we knew their game plan.
[03:37:20.002 --> 03:37:23.265]  I didn't learn all this stuff out of some palantir crystal ball.
[03:37:23.385 --> 03:37:37.118]  I did it by reading the books and publications that these creatures put out, because they communicate with each other and are very honest about their diabolical plan for world government, depopulation, transhumanism, total robot control.
[03:37:37.638 --> 03:37:39.219]  And I've believed in humanity.
[03:37:39.719 --> 03:37:45.102]  I bet on you, because I was betting on myself, and I know that it's always darkest right before the dawn.
[03:37:45.882 --> 03:37:58.809]  And so now, in 2024, so close to this election, it is more critical than ever to not just keep InfoWars on the air, but to not take the reports and the videos and the articles and the interviews and to get those out to everybody you know.
[03:37:59.489 --> 03:38:05.716]  I understand that's really stating the obvious, but we have to understand how urgent the moment is and really redouble our efforts.
[03:38:06.016 --> 03:38:07.137]  And I'm saying that myself.
[03:38:07.237 --> 03:38:08.799]  I'm on the air seven days a week.
[03:38:08.819 --> 03:38:09.880]  I'm doing a lot of interviews.
[03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:11.482]  I'm doing more special reports.
[03:38:11.502 --> 03:38:12.583]  We're going out in the field.
[03:38:13.023 --> 03:38:18.369]  We are busting our ass because the future destiny of humanity is really on the line right now.
[03:38:18.969 --> 03:38:25.054]  Now, a critical part of InfoWars continuing on, and hopefully even expanding into the future, is your support.
[03:38:25.094 --> 03:38:26.355]  And we make it so easy.
[03:38:26.755 --> 03:38:33.861]  We bring you the very best products that are out there that will empower and enrich your life at very competitive, affordable prices.
[03:38:34.501 --> 03:38:35.942]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:38:41.463 --> 03:38:42.504]  They really are incredible.
[03:38:42.684 --> 03:38:47.545]  They're the very best that the supplement industry has to offer and they really work.
[03:38:47.846 --> 03:38:48.966]  That's why people love them.
[03:38:49.226 --> 03:38:51.907]  The fastest growing industry in the United States, other than AI,
[03:38:52.347 --> 03:38:52.987]  We're good to go.
[03:39:14.881 --> 03:39:16.183]  You need to check it out for yourself.
[03:39:16.223 --> 03:39:19.326]  You hear the callers talking about it all the time without me even prompting them.
[03:39:19.707 --> 03:39:20.728]  It is amazing.
[03:39:21.068 --> 03:39:23.070]  Then you've got Joint Relief Max.
[03:39:23.151 --> 03:39:25.073]  It is a natural pain reliever.
[03:39:25.113 --> 03:39:27.075]  Works really, really well in a healthy way.
[03:39:27.095 --> 03:39:28.917]  You have turmeric 95.
[03:39:29.157 --> 03:39:30.078]  95% curcuminoid.
[03:39:30.279 --> 03:39:32.221]  This is where we get the turmeric for bodies.
[03:39:32.281 --> 03:39:33.122]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:39:33.342 --> 03:39:34.503]  They're both excellent.
[03:39:34.583 --> 03:39:35.503]  Infowars MD.
[03:39:35.843 --> 03:39:39.865]  We've got the full spectrum CBD gummies.
[03:39:40.085 --> 03:39:40.626]  25 milligrams.
[03:39:40.726 --> 03:39:42.006]  Great anti-inflammatory.
[03:39:42.326 --> 03:39:46.749]  Isn't a downer, isn't a depressant, but makes you very relaxed and focused.
[03:39:46.789 --> 03:39:49.230]  It's almost like a stimulant in a weird way, but...
[03:39:49.930 --> 03:39:50.431]  It's different.
[03:39:50.791 --> 03:39:53.594]  And then, of course, we've got other great products for women and men.
[03:39:53.694 --> 03:39:54.615]  Ageless Vitality.

[03:40:05.124 --> 03:40:11.850]  That is made by one of the top manufacturers in the country, who sells it at retail for twice the price we sell it, then they discount it.
[03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:17.155]  Even at the discount, we're selling it for about 50% less than the actual manufacturer does.
[03:40:17.395 --> 03:40:19.777]  There's not as much profit, but it's a great deal.
[03:40:20.478 --> 03:40:24.361]  1,000 milligrams CBD oil, InfoWars MD, that's the tincture.
[03:40:24.641 --> 03:40:29.265]  Then we've got all these other amazing products from InfoWars MD as well.
[03:40:30.106 --> 03:40:32.327]  They're excellent and it funds the operation.
