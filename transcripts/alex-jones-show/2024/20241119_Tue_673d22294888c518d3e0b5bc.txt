[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.730]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:25.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, NATO began bombing today inside Russia, blowing up Russian military bases.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.500]  Putin's promised nuclear war by Christmas.
[00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.019]  If it doesn't stop, stay with us.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.899]  Infowars.
[00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.659]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.520]  We are 61 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 42 seconds until the inauguration of Trump.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.020]  And as I told you what happened, the globalists are trying to launch World War III before then.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.359]  The president agrees with that and has made similar statements that the military-industrial complex is trying to get us into World War III before he takes office.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.659]  His son made the point two days ago.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.399]  Now Trump has made it.
[00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.640]  It is Tuesday, November 19th, 2024.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:16.000]  You're seeing footage of long-range, high-speed U.S.-made attack-of-missiles Blowing up a Russian military base 300 kilometers inside Russia.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.540]  They're promising to rain down hundreds of these a week inside Russia to elicit a massive response.
[00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.719]  This is a proxy war between the West and Russia.
[00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.579]  Imagine if Russia said we're going to start bombing targets in the United States or if in Vietnam...
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.579]  The Vietnamese said we're going to start attacking targets inside the United States.
[00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.299]  Or in the Korean War, if Korea started launching attacks inside the United States, what would you do?
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.859]  This is the absolute insane brinksmanship of the globalist.
[00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.379]  Putin had announced the policy change two months ago.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.400]  Now it's official today.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.519]  Russia reserves the right to strike any NATO country or all NATO countries at the same time with nuclear weapons because of this.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.260]  And he said we could have nuclear war by Christmas if the escalation does not stop.
[00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:08.659]  And that's in all the main threat escalation maps and war games by Russia, by the United States, by China, by NATO. So that is not a bluff.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.860]  That is where this is going.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.740]  It is indescribable how insane this is.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.419]  And when the Justice Department tried to shut us down again last week without a court order, just like they did on May 31st, I said they're trying to kill Trump on May 31st.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.479]  I said, watch, this isn't about me.
[00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.240]  This is so illegal, what they're doing, and so unlawful.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.080]  Something bigger is about to happen.
[00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.560]  And then I said last week, they're getting ready to launch World War III or something along those lines.
[00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:57.189]  We're good to go.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.539]  I would imagine that there's gonna be some serious things happen that the bad guys aren't gonna like.
[00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:11.659]  Behind the scenes, the bad guys have done some incredible new stuff that we're not gonna announce at this point, probably later in the show, or not tonight, the latest tomorrow.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.240]  Total desperation.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.539]  This is happening not just to us, but everybody that is a patriot right now.
[00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.439]  We are in a war.
[00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.680]  The globalists are not gonna back down.
[00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.409]  On the surface, they say they're capitulating to the voters and Trump and America, but they are not capitulating.
[00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.889]  They are only attacking harder than ever.
[00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.530]  I want to explain something very slowly here.
[00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.469]  The Onion did not buy InfoWars.
[00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.770]  That was a hoax.
[00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:34.530]  That was a lie.
[00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.590]  That's what they do is put out hoaxes.
[00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.009]  It was a power grab.
[00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.409]  They thought people would just buy it.
[00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.030]  99% chance this is all reversed.
[00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.990]  My lawyers are some of the top bankruptcy lawyers in the country.
[00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.590]  They said they're never absolutely sure of something, but they said in this case, for the first time ever, they've never seen something this cut and dry.
[00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.469]  The issue here is, and I'm going to get into all the news when we come back, that we have major damages.
[00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:05.090]  We have filed suit on them today and put them on notice, not destroy any evidence.
[00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.169]  And I'll be breaking that news coming up.
[00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.430]  But we looked at the numbers since Thursday.
[00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.389]  It cut the revenue coming into the AlexJonesStore.com in half.
[00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.209]  And the listeners told us, we don't want to give money to the Onion.
[00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.970]  InfoWars, Alex Jones...
[00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.709]  It has no ownership of the AlexJoneStore.com.
[00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:30.129]  That is a sponsor in Arkansas that makes some of the top Trump paraphernalia over the last few years.
[00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.610]  They're great patriots.
[00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.829]  It's made, all of it's made in Arkansas.
[00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:38.629]  The knives, the t-shirts, the supplements are private label, the top brands.
[00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.129]  Okay, so the bad guys have no claim and are not going to get that.
[00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.550]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:46.509]  We have shortfalls now.
[00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.649]  We barely had enough money coming into the sponsor to operate and to build backups and things you saw last week.
[00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.610]  We're very busy.
[00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.389]  We're finishing a bigger studio right now.
[00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.550]  These are great products.
[00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.730]  Take action now.
[00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.550]  Don't let the enemy brainwash you and win.
[00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.170]  They do not own thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:02.050]  Go there now.
[00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:04.589]  Get the fundraiser posters, limited edition.
[00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.110]  Get the incredible pay trigger.
[00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.610]  Get the incredible supplements, please.
[00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.689]  I've been on air 30 and a half years.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:22.680]  We, this audience, this crew, our reports, our films, launch the modern global revolution against the new world order.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.589]  Because of our work and your support, Humanity is not being caught flat-footed right now in this fight, and we are turning the tide and winning.
[00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.149]  Team Humanity is on the march, but the globalists are striking back.
[00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:41.790]  World War III alert.
[00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.329]  Russia threatens imminent nuclear war after NATO launches bombing campaign inside Russia.
[00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.610]  Congressman Massey and other major Republican leaders call for the immediate removal of Biden under the 25th Amendment.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.839]  But then what will the puppet Harris do?
[00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:00.980]  Maybe that's why they ordered Biden to do this or said he ordered it so that he's finally removed.
[00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.980]  Then we get something worse.
[00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.899]  Plans within plans.
[00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:07.120]  Wheels within wheels.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.040]  That's what we see.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.079]  That's what we know.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:20.480]  All right, we have the author of the U.S. Chemical Biological Weapons Treaties and former top U.N. war crimes prosecutor, Dr.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.740]  Francis Boyle, joining us coming up in a little while.
[00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.019]  We're also getting General Flynn slotted in right now and others.
[00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:34.560]  But let me break down the latest news here for you right now on this emergency.
[00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.600]  Tuesday, November 19th, 2024.
[00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:38.620]  And remember...
[00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:41.399]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:42.680]  You are the resistance.
[00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:49.300]  And when you decide, listening on a local talk radio station, to tell everybody you know and those you don't know, tune in now.
[00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.579]  And tell them to tell others to tune in and those they tell others to tune in.
[00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:55.339]  That causes the chain reaction.
[00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:59.540]  When you tell people watching on cloud TV, we're number one on that out of thousands of shows and channels.
[00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.899]  You share that link to family and tell people to tune in.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.379]  We reach not 3 or 4 million on that a day, but 10 million.
[00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:16.810]  When you take the live links at Real Alex Jones on X and at AJN Live for the Alex Jones Network, we'll put that on screen, at AJN Live.
[00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:25.610]  When you follow that and you share the live feeds we just launched eight minutes ago, we'll have 20 million viewers on there by the end of the show when you take action.
[00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:34.449]  And then the clips we're going to take out of this live show got 127 million views yesterday on X alone.
[00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:41.009]  We are fighting hard against World War III. We are fighting hard to stop the inflation and secure our border.
[00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.329]  We are fighting hard to secure our elections and have integrity.
[00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:50.069]  We are fighting hard against the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.959]  And only you keep us on air.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.160]  Only you share the articles and videos and clips.
[00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:01.060]  Only you hold victory in your hands.
[00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:06.800]  Not the out-of-control criminal deep state that has 62 days left to try to shut down all of the patriots.
[00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:27.029]  You, when you share the articles and videos, you, when you share the live feeds, you, when you go to the AlexJonesStore.com and get incredible, high-quality, game-changing supplements in hundreds and hundreds of different t-shirts and hoodies and ball caps promoting patriotism and freedom, wearing your uniform of liberty out in the open so the enemy knows we're the majority and so you meet like-minded people.
[00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:31.129]  That keeps us on the air here and at the Alex Jones Network if this gets shut down.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.440]  The Alex Jones store is not owned by me.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.320]  It is not owned by Free Speech Systems.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.580]  It's not owned by Infowars.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.039]  The enemy has no claim to it.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.720]  It is owned by Patriots in Arkansas.
[00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:46.600]  We have a long history of producing the top-selling Trump apparel for years.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.379]  And we are allied with them, and they back the Alex Jones Network.
[00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.679]  Other people own the Alex Jones Network.
[00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.220]  The enemy has no claim on it.
[00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:57.220]  And they didn't shut us down for an hour.
[00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:08.509]  Not 10 minutes on Thursday when they claimed they'd bought this place and let a judge's order shut it and sent a federal agent here to order us to shut down.
[00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.269]  I said no.
[00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.870]  So he called the internet service providers and shut this building down.
[00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.789]  And I said you made a big mistake buddy.
[00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.570]  I believe you've committed crimes.
[00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.529]  And now...
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.840]  The real folks that filed to buy this place that had the winning bid have filed their operation.
[00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:35.139]  I have filed my lawsuits and emergency restraining orders today and never in Walter Sissack's 45 years as one of the top bankruptcy lawyers in the country.
[00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:37.000]  And he's the lawyer for the good bidders.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.279]  Has he ever alleged crimes in his filings today?
[00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:48.169]  Against a U.S. trustee or the people involved.
[00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:50.549]  And he has done it because it's clear cut.
[00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.669]  We don't allege crimes.
[00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.029]  They're right there.
[00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.549]  So they want to fight.
[00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.230]  They better believe they got one.
[00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.049]  And let me tell you.
[00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:02.370]  I'm not going to announce this yet.
[00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.409]  But I made the point of how will they escalate.
[00:10:07.549 --> 00:10:08.750]  Well, they did yesterday.
[00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:13.929]  And when I announced this, it's even more shocking.
[00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:15.690]  What they did.
[00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:17.710]  But this is the government.
[00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.889]  This is the rogue government.
[00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.049]  This is the U.S. government still in the globalist hands that did this.
[00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.330]  We have the documents.
[00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:26.789]  We have it all.
[00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.389]  And let's just say this, as they already know, people are rolling over.
[00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:34.429]  So this is spectacular.
[00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.750]  Just like in Pennsylvania, where all these different counties said, we don't care what the law is.
[00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:40.950]  We're going to let people vote repeatedly.
[00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:42.570]  We're going to let illegal aliens vote.
[00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.149]  We don't care what federal and state law said.
[00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.490]  They are now being arrested in Pennsylvania, in Minnesota.
[00:10:50.289 --> 00:10:57.730]  I mean, it is incredible how they're trying to steal those key congressional and Senate seat in Pennsylvania and Minnesota.
[00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.340]  Still counting ballots on the 19th of November.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.200]  So that's all coming up.
[00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:09.519]  And this is all emblematic of the wild-eyed desperation.
[00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:13.580]  So they are not giving in to the voters.
[00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.059]  They're not giving in to the landslide.
[00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:16.399]  They're not giving in to the Great Awakening.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.820]  They're not giving in to the political realignment.
[00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:30.440]  On the surface, some of the globalists like Bezos and Zuckerberg and the Morning Joe, Psycho Joe and his crazy wife, they're kissing ass and groveling and a bunch of others are.
[00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:36.100]  But in reality, the deep state's still in attack mode against the American people.
[00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:42.980]  And now they've tried to start World War III. So let me now get into why you're all tuned in.
[00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:45.799]  But remember, all the attempts...
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:57.019]  To shut us down right now are emblematic of the total fifth generational war we are deep in and that we have the initiative in and that we are winning.
[00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.399]  But now is the time for you to be Paul Revere's.
[00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.899]  Now is the time for you to share the information.
[00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:04.860]  That is beyond critical.
[00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:07.259]  It is absolutely essential, paramount.
[00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.080]  It is everything.
[00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.320]  All right, here's what's happened.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.159]  NATO made an agreement.
[00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:32.710]  In the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 under George Herbert Walker Bush and the Secretary General of NATO to not move one inch eastward towards Russia if Russia turned loose of its former Russian Federation and Soviet Empire.
[00:12:33.289 --> 00:12:39.429]  They made the deal with Mikhail Gorbachev and they made the deal with Yeltsin and his deputy, Vladimir Putin.
[00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.740]  Then You can pull the maps up.
[00:12:45.899 --> 00:13:03.460]  Since then, NATO has added more than 10 countries, moved right up to the border with Russia, triggered the civil war ongoing in the last decade or plus in Ukraine as the proxy shadow hybrid war in the last almost three years since three Februaries ago.
[00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:06.720]  It has escalated into full continental war.
[00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:14.309]  And on the threat escalation ladder, Heavier weapons, advisors, NATO troops.
[00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:16.570]  Then the Russians bring in North Korean troops.
[00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:33.529]  Then the West brings nuclear-capable missiles up to the border of Russia that you would use in a sneak attack, where in just 10, 15 seconds, depending on the target, 30 seconds further away, you can launch it and destroy the Russian missile fields, their strategic nuclear bombers,
[00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.049]  their cruise missile launchers.
[00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:46.649]  In a sneak attack for a preemptive nuclear war that since Obama got into office has been the default position the United States reserves the right to strike with nuclear weapons first.
[00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.210]  Russia did not have that policy, officially changed it in the last two months, and officially announced it today.
[00:13:55.429 --> 00:14:10.629]  That Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first in a large, conventional aerospace, meaning missile and aircraft attack, Putin said that two months ago,
[00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:18.110]  he said it again a month ago, now he said it today, and now that is happening right now.
[00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.190]  You see Putin there.
[00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:31.269]  Now we'll go to some of the footage of the Russian military base and depot munition stockpile being blown up today.
[00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.490]  Russia says six U.S.-made attackums were launched into the country.
[00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:42.690]  They claim to have shot down five of the six.
[00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.649]  One hit the base.
[00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:55.330]  And there is the giant mushroom cloud that resulted from that explosion.
[00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.830]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:06.970]  Putin put out a statement saying nuclear war by Christmas on the current escalation trajectory.
[00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:20.710]  In response, Congressman Massey and many other Republicans said Biden is greenlighting total war, nuclear war.
[00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:23.149]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.710]  Representative Thomas Massey says Biden greenlighting, striking Russia, an unconstitutional act of war and impeachable offense.
[00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.129]  They're also calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.
[00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.330]  So is General Flynn.
[00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.830]  And the issue is, obviously, Biden's not in control.
[00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:39.230]  Then you've got Kamala Harris.
[00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.490]  And then she has a pretext during the escalated war to have Trump assassinated.
[00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:47.049]  They'll claim he's a Russian agent, as they already are.
[00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:53.539]  Declare martial law, launch a cyber attack, claim the Russians have done it, cut off a lot of the power across the country.
[00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:55.480]  That's what they've been pre-programming, that's what I've been warning of.
[00:15:55.659 --> 00:16:00.740]  They launch a war with Russia, escalate, knock a bunch of power out, blame it on the Russians, use that to turn off the internet.
[00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:12.019]  You'll still get government feeds, but the internet kill switch that Obama put in place means you only get government and establishment feeds, and we go into total civil unrest martial law.
[00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:21.649]  And there is a very good chance, as I warned before this happened in months and weeks and days past, that they would start striking Russia during the 76 days he was president-elect.
[00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:29.610]  In fact, I said right the day after Trump won on November 6th, I said good chance they, in the next few weeks, start bombing Russia.
[00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:36.320]  And then that will be used as the excuse to launch cyber attacks inside the US. Blame Russia.
[00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:42.799]  Claim Trump is a Putin ally because he doesn't want World War III. Kill Trump and Vance or have them arrested.
[00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:45.480]  Remove Biden and stall Kamala Harris.
[00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:46.759]  And now it's all happening.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.139]  So of course they had the Justice Department last week without the sale even happening.
[00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:55.720]  Criminally come in here and turn the power off.
[00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:00.139]  That is all part of the military operation.
[00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.100]  We're now under attack.
[00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:07.220]  This is America 2024 on November 19th, 2024.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:15.460]  So let's go over what the congressman, another congressman in Flynn, have to say that I'll go over the details of the military.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:27.200]  Crisis, the greatest nuclear threat ever, the two seconds to midnight, mainline analysts, the International Atomic Science Association, all of them said the dims day clock is the closest it's ever been.
[00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:28.890]  This is not even debatable.
[00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.269]  Even CNN says closest nuclear war ever.
[00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.529]  This is not a drill.
[00:17:32.769 --> 00:17:34.250]  This is total psychotic behavior.
[00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:35.849]  This is happening right now.
[00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:43.609]  This is a desperate globalist establishment at the end of their financial bubble trying to terrorize the world, the American people, the Russians, everybody else into this.
[00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.049]  Now it's coming out.
[00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.869]  It looks like the Chinese cut the cables in the Black Sea.
[00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.829]  The war is escalating very, very fast.
[00:17:55.559 --> 00:18:04.640]  Representative Thomas Massey says Biden's green lining striking Russia, an unconstitutional act of war, impeachable offense, by authorizing long-range missiles to strike inside Russia.
[00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:09.779]  Biden is committing an unconstitutional act of war that endangers the lives of all U.S. citizens.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:29.650]  This is an impeachable offense, but the reality is he's an Emasculated puppet of the deep state, Massey said, yesterday, so this was out last night before the bombs started dropping, inside Russia, yes, our government is bombing inside Russia with giant red mushroom clouds.
[00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:43.609]  Statements by the member of Congress regarding impeachable offenses are serious ones, as the House indicts And the Senate tries a president during an impeachment proceeding.
[00:18:44.849 --> 00:18:46.430]  Continuing, this is General Flynn.
[00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:48.329]  I want to repost this on X right now.
[00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:57.690]  Just because I'm busy, I'm on air, so have one of the crew that's in my X say, General Flynn is 100% correct!
[00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.410]  Exclamation point.
[00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:08.029]  The deep state must be peacefully removed from power or they are going to kill us all in nuclear hellfire.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.400]  Put it out.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.079]  Breaking.
[00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:16.240]  Last 24 hours, Ukraine fired attackums into Russian territory.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.880]  A clear escalation of war.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.819]  A massive escalation.
[00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:20.920]  So what?
[00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:26.509]  One, Harris should immediately invoke, not like, so what?
[00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.849]  Who cares?
[00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.650]  Like, so what do we do?
[00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:42.910]  Number one, Harris should immediately invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Biden, his sleepwalking us into World War III. Let's at least put the constitutional pressure on Harris because Joe's poor memory make him unaccountable.
[00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:46.380]  See special counsel report.
[00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:52.200]  Two, the current House of Representatives must impeach Biden for endangering the United States.
[00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:56.539]  Hell, Trump was impeached for losing the 2020 election.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.140]  Three, incoming U.S. officials must make contact with Putin to de-escalate the situation.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.500]  See my conversation with a former Russian ambassador.
[00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:09.859]  Different circumstances, but same outcome.
[00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:11.039]  De-escalation.
[00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:21.519]  Four, Trump administration, especially incoming A.G. Matt Gaetz, need to make it clear that the identities of the deep state operatives pulling the strings of the presidency urging Biden to act recklessly.
[00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:23.039]  Yeah, that's just treason.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.359]  Five, pray that we make it to January 20th.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.740]  The voters spoke.
[00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:33.319]  Trump's mandate to end the killing and seek peace needs to be America's path.
[00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:35.680]  I will provide more details later today.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.640]  This is an urgent call to stop the matters before World War III is inevitable.
[00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:51.039]  I told the crew when they shut us down illegally last week, I said...
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.299]  Don't freak out about this.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.180]  We'll be back in the building.
[00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:55.900]  This is fraud.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.279]  I said, probably by tomorrow, which we were.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.940]  I said, but worry about World War III. Worry about the bombing of Russia.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.299]  I said, I don't air.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.640]  I said, that's what this means.
[00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:10.299]  That's the path they're going.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.920]  I told you hundreds of times, hundreds, probably a thousand times, before the election and right after it, their big move is war with Russia.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.279]  And they're also pre-programming race attacks and then blaming it on Trump supporters.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.660]  But that'll happen probably during the war.
[00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.680]  So this is horrible.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.759]  This is way more dangerous than Hitler in 1942 invading Russia because they didn't have nuclear weapons back then.
[00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.039]  Operation Barbarossa.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.299]  That ended up with 26 million dead Russians to at least 24 million dead Germans.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.039]  90 plus percent of World War II was those two groups killing each other.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.559]  You know what happened to Napoleon going into Russia?
[00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.500]  I guess some of you don't.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.680]  But this is not a good situation.
[00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:56.960]  Russia has the largest nuclear weapons system in the world.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.940]  They've got about 60% more weapons than we do.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:10.839]  They've got at least 50 nuclear submarines loaded with cruise missiles and ICBM ballistic missiles.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.359]  They can vaporize the entire East Coast, the entire West Coast in three minutes.
[00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:23.269]  They can vaporize Texas in 60 seconds.
[00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:25.269]  Vaporize.
[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.650]  The missiles will hit Chicago.
[00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:31.250]  They're fired from the Gulf in six, seven minutes.
[00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.970]  They're like, well, we'll blow them up too, Sean Penn said.
[00:22:36.069 --> 00:22:37.130]  Yeah, you dumbass.
[00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.390]  That's why it's called MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction.
[00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:43.039]  So, the globalists are nihilists.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.720]  They're Satanists.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.299]  And I believe, I know God's going to intervene.
[00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:46.880]  We pray.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.180]  Pray for Trump.
[00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:48.839]  Pray for peace.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.359]  But there, you can pull this up.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.059]  Biden said last year, he said again this year, he goes, I haven't talked to Putin since he invaded Ukraine.
[00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.029]  So, there is no communication going on.
[00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:09.730]  I mean, remember General Milley on January 6th said he called the top Chinese general and said, don't worry, Trump's not in control of the nuke codes, as if Trump was going to nuke China.
[00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:13.309]  Trump, when peace was de-escalating and beating them with trade war.
[00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.329]  And they're the ones doing all this now.
[00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:23.210]  They're the ones starting World War III. And so, where are the...
[00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.170]  Where...
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.819]  Is the president, well, he's wandering around in the Brazilian rainforest right now.
[00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:32.259]  And a whole bunch of the globalists have gone down to Brazil.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.240]  So I guess they're going to try to be in the Southern Hemisphere when there's a nuclear war?
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.640]  I mean, I want Liz Cheney and Biden and all of them.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.559]  Why don't you go to Ukraine?
[00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.380]  Why don't you go to the front lines?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.039]  That's what Trump said.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.920]  They go, that's a threat.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.599]  No, that's the classic saying.
[00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.640]  You love war so much, why don't you go fight it?
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.299]  So while they're all down in Brazil...
[00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.990]  And God knows where Kamala Harris is.
[00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.710]  Their new scheme is World War III to stay in power.
[00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:08.289]  So I told Roger Stone yesterday, and I tell everybody now, Trump needs to be making major press conferences, major statements on this.
[00:24:09.069 --> 00:24:10.789]  This is the globalist attack.
[00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:14.430]  This is their attempt to hold the world hostage to stay in power.
[00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.529]  All right, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:21.789]  I'll go over the nuclear doctrine, the big changes, what all this means.
[00:24:23.389 --> 00:24:28.509]  Keira Starmer, the British puppet prime minister, got into office with 18% of the vote.
[00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.289]  I'll explain how.
[00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.089]  He says, how dare Russia have a first strike policy?
[00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.349]  Well, the UK has one, so does the US. Which is insane.
[00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:40.650]  So, that's where this is going.
[00:24:41.069 --> 00:24:42.150]  I mean, seriously.
[00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:52.089]  I'm having to control myself not to go grab my children and try to make my parents come with me and get on an airplane to South America.
[00:24:54.469 --> 00:25:00.910]  But, although civilization will collapse if there's a nuclear war in the Northern Hemisphere, it'll be day of the dead down there too.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:06.150]  So, I've already made the decision we're going down with a ship right here.
[00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.769]  So, that's where we are.
[00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:16.089]  So, at a gut level, viscerally, my cells, my will and my spirit say we stay here, this is it.
[00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:19.789]  But my flesh is weak, and I just ignore it.
[00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.849]  But my flesh is, get out of here now.
[00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.410]  Because the flesh is connected to the gut, which is just a manifestation of the spirit.
[00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:33.329]  And so it's like, oh my God, this is the most dangerous thing in all of history.
[00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.289]  And the average person is still talking about the NFL and Netflix and, hey, let's get drunk.
[00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:41.829]  So we're ripe for total destruction.
[00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.269]  So the globalist plan to stay in power is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:25:46.589 --> 00:25:47.630]  And I don't feel fine.
[00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:48.900]  We're going to go to break.
[00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.039]  I want to keep making this announcement.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:26:06.059]  I was so busy getting back in the building and filing lawsuits and restraining orders and routing the bad guys and publishing their documents through court record of all the fraud that's cut right by the Justice Department, by the globalist system that I didn't explain to you,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.859]  and I'm explaining again.
[00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:09.759]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is not owned by me.
[00:26:10.349 --> 00:26:12.329]  The AlexJonesStore.com is not owned by Infowars.
[00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:19.910]  The Onion, which the Everytown Brady Gun Control Group, which admits they own it with the Onion.
[00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.450]  They've got a partnership running this fraud.
[00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:23.569]  You're running this power grab.
[00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.170]  They don't own Infowars.
[00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:31.809]  So if you order stuff at Infowars, even the bad guys take it over, they say they'll make good and ship it out.
[00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:34.069]  I don't know if that's true, but Infowars is there.
[00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:34.869]  The stuff's in stock.
[00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:35.670]  It ships out of Colorado.
[00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.109]  Okay, and I still own that on record, the judge said last week.
[00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:44.910]  But if you go to thealexjonesstore.com, they are great patriots.
[00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:46.150]  Worked with them for a long time.
[00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:59.490]  They got the very best patriot apparel, the very best supplements, a lot of limited edition fundraiser posters, the Trump back-to-back-to-back win, the Alex Jones Star Wars-esque fund poster, some classic InfoWars posters.
[00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:00.690]  Those have markup on them.
[00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:07.049]  So we actually get some funds and operate for these lawsuits, for the offensives, for the Alex Jones Network, for what we've got set up.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.680]  And they are really pissed we're raising funds because we're beating them.
[00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:11.700]  Okay?
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.859]  So, go get the new murdered out Trump shirt.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.680]  It's really badass.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.880]  The hats are very popular.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.779]  The murdered out hats.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.619]  Get the ultimate CMOS. It's all there.
[00:27:20.819 --> 00:27:21.880]  We need funds.
[00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:25.200]  And the sales went down by half since the power grab.
[00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.400]  People thought that was them.
[00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.980]  I don't want to support the Onion.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.940]  The Onion doesn't have any claims on that.
[00:27:31.079 --> 00:27:31.579]  They don't own it.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.500]  Patriots in Arkansas do.
[00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:33.859]  They're our supporters.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.599]  They're backing us.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.299]  They're funding us.
[00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.329]  We're basically turning over all the profit right now to us to stay on air.
[00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.170]  So go to theaukshowstore.com now.
[00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:41.190]  Defend your own freedom.
[00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:47.650]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:49.190]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:55.029]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels over foreseen.
[00:27:55.869 --> 00:28:10.730]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party allied with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:13.430]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.710]  But we can't control everything individually.
[00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.529]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:20.369]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.390]  And I've got faith.
[00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:51.690]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing
[00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.109]  products.

[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.480]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.

[00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:21.509]  Now go to drjonesnaturals.com and I thank you for your support.
[00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:23.250]  All right, we're back live.
[00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:26.210]  General Flynn is coming on in minutes with emergency information.
[00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.930]  We are the closest to World War III, hands down.
[00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.690]  No military analyst denies it that we've ever been.
[00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:42.309]  Putin has said if the U.S. starts firing missiles into Russia, that Russia will officially be at war with the United States as their default position.
[00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:44.470]  He said that two months ago, a month ago, and today.
[00:31:44.690 --> 00:32:00.509]  And now it's all over the Russian news that they are fully at war with every NATO country, including the United States and the U.K. That's where we are right now on Tuesday, November 19, 2024, at 1134 Central Standard Time.
[00:32:01.769 --> 00:32:05.269]  Every one of your lives is in the most danger it's ever been.
[00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:09.470]  Our very futures all hang in the balance.
[00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:11.490]  And what did I tell you?
[00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.509]  Probably over a thousand times in the last year.
[00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:22.109]  If Trump is able to override the fraud, if we're able to do it, their main move will be bombing inside Russia to escalate into total war.
[00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.210]  This is absolute megalomaniac madness.
[00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.670]  This is Hitler-level crap.
[00:32:33.079 --> 00:32:35.960]  We have a degenerate, out-of-control establishment.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.960]  Most of them don't even understand military systems.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.099]  You've got a bunch of banker families represented by BlackRock, and their whole global Ponzi scheme's coming down.
[00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:53.559]  And we are trying to get Trump into stabilized stuff, and the U.S. will actually be dominant for another hundred years if we just do this.
[00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:56.859]  They sucked our power, used it to set up their global government.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.319]  Now the whole world's turned against it.
[00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:07.089]  Their entire Great Reset is falling on its face, and their answer is put a gun to the American people in the world's head of nuclear Russian roulette.
[00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:15.670]  And this isn't like playing Russian roulette where you've got six cylinders and only one of them has got a.357 Magnum round in it.
[00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:19.109]  This is like playing Russian roulette with three bullets in it.
[00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:19.670]  You spin it.
[00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:21.750]  It's like 50-50 right now.
[00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:22.650]  We're going to have a nuclear war.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.660]  And that's the mainline analysis.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.339]  This is totally over-the-top, maximum insanity right now.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.200]  And Trump and others have come out and said, yeah, this is a military industrial complex trying to start World War III before he gets in office.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.759]  62 days.
[00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:46.000]  Congressman Massey says start impeachment of Biden immediately.
[00:33:46.579 --> 00:33:48.299]  25th Amendment as well.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.200]  That's exactly what General Flynn is saying.
[00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:57.849]  But the biggest thing we can do is pray to God for peace, pray for sanity.
[00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:08.030]  Biden announced two months ago he was going to start bombing Russia, and then it was in the Washington Post, but we already knew that almost all of his advisors that are military said, do not do this, including the Pentagon.
[00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.650]  And then Sunday at 2 p.m.
[00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:21.489]  Central, the New York Times says Biden has greenlit the bombing, and the bombing started in the middle of the night in Russia today.
[00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:33.070]  Roll the B-roll of one of the missiles hitting a Russian military base, an arms depot, and blowing it sky-high in a giant orange mushroom cloud.
[00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.469]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:48.690 --> 00:35:04.460]  Now, General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former National Security Advisor to President Trump,
[00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:07.420]  is our guest joining us.
[00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:16.449]  At this incredibly important moment in human history, Representative Massey has called for immediate impeachment of the 25th Amendment.
[00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.889]  So are other members of Congress.
[00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.550]  More of their statements are coming out now.
[00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.469]  We're getting those for you.
[00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:31.190]  General Flynn has issued a post on X that we have reposted on Real Alex Jones that needs a billion views, where he lays out what needs to be done now.
[00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.050]  He put this out recently.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.960]  General Flynn, thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:43.340]  Please give us an update with your expertise on exactly what's happening.
[00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:48.949]  Yeah, so first of all, Alex, thanks for getting me on here quickly.
[00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:50.570]  You guys are great.
[00:35:50.909 --> 00:36:00.889]  This is an incredibly provocative action, and the provocation is not coming from the Kremlin this time, right?
[00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:18.920]  So all of these people that scream about Russia, Russia, Russia, You know, this is a provocation, a very offensive weapon system called ATACMS is the acronym, ATACMS. But this provocation that was begun probably about a week ago,
[00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:22.579]  we heard glimmers of it in the media, I think on Sunday.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:30.619]  And then overnight, we've seen at least some number of these very offensive weapons fired into Russian territory.
[00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:37.550]  Now, You know, and I not only posted on X some things, because I get up this morning.
[00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:38.969]  You know, I was up late last night.
[00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.449]  I get up at about 3 o'clock this morning.
[00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:44.730]  I'm following all this stuff, and I'm starting to go through, OK, what the hell should happen?
[00:36:44.989 --> 00:36:46.650]  And what needs to happen right now?
[00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.769]  And I laid this out in a summary on my X post this morning.
[00:36:51.769 --> 00:36:59.809]  And then I just put out about an hour ago a substack, an article with a little bit more analysis.
[00:37:00.389 --> 00:37:15.090]  But bottom line is that this is where, and backing up just a hair, I just saw some breaking news where Vice President Harris, and I hope that this is not true, is taking a vacation to Hawaii.
[00:37:15.949 --> 00:37:17.230]  And I hope that's not the case.
[00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:31.130]  I know that the president and the vice president have all kinds of communications to be able to do anything, but we are in the midst of a potential World War III provocation that was initiated by us.
[00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:38.539]  And Putin did come out on Monday and made a statement on Monday, and I also posted that.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:48.719]  So the first couple of things that have to happen, Congress must act right now, because if the White House is not going to act, Joe Biden is clearly not in charge.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.420]  We have deep state operatives and deep state bureaucrats that I believe are making decisions.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:00.739]  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, Blinken and Austin, they're not clean here.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.099]  I do think that Matt Gaetz ought to make a statement.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.119]  I do think that President Trump has got to be contemplating making some phone calls.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:30.920]  I think that Matt Gaetz ought to make a statement and let it be known right now that When he comes in to be the Attorney General, which he will be coming in to be the Attorney General, folks, that everybody that's involved in this decision-making process, going back to the decision to even provide these very offensive weapons to Ukraine,
[00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:38.940]  that keep all your communications, folks, because there's going to be an investigation and somebody's going to be held liable here.
[00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:43.619]  And so when it comes to President Biden, so what needs to happen?
[00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:47.800]  Harris needs to invoke the 25th Amendment immediately.
[00:38:48.179 --> 00:39:01.820]  Number two, the Congress for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, because there's no declaration of war here by Congress, and this is a very, very dangerous phase that we are going into.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.679]  So I'm glad to hear about Massey.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.059]  Massey is absolutely 100% right.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:15.969]  And there has to be, I mean, hell, and in my analysis that I wrote about, Trump was impeached for saying that the election was stolen.
[00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.789]  Trump was impeached for a perfectly good phone call.
[00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.110]  Two of them, actually.
[00:39:20.369 --> 00:39:36.829]  And so we're now talking about the provisioning of very highly sophisticated weapon systems that can only be used to acquire their targets when you use satellite systems that Ukraine doesn't have.
[00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:38.510]  Ukraine is not capable.
[00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:47.099]  The people of Ukraine right now, until they receive You know, years of training, in many cases, can't handle the types of weapons systems that we have.
[00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.460]  So we've got NATO complicity, for sure.
[00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:53.659]  We've got White House complicity, for sure.
[00:39:54.039 --> 00:40:05.010]  And so the outcome or the consequence Especially with what Putin said recently in his statement, everybody needs to go and listen to what he basically said.
[00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:19.389]  He said that there will be an action, there will be a consequence to this very provocative step that the West is taking, because Putin recognized immediately that That Ukraine can't handle these.
[00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.789]  This is not a system in their inventory, nor is it a capability that they have.
[00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:33.489]  They have to use other means, meaning they have to use other countries to leverage the way that this weapon system can be used.
[00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.650]  So there is going to be a consequence.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:41:00.800]  I don't know And instead of fighting for peace as Donald Trump, as President Trump has continued to say, what is happening is these people are taking us to war.
[00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:03.739]  Last thing, Alex, and I'll get off my high horse here.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:13.559]  Last Wednesday, Trump met with Biden and Biden, like Obama told him back in 2016, this is going to be a peaceful transfer of power.
[00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:17.030]  It's like sticking a needle into Trump's eye, right?
[00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:27.869]  Three days later, we get the report that ATACMS is now going to be used and it's authorized to be used by this White House in Ukraine to fire into Russian territory.
[00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.269]  That is not a peaceful transfer of power.
[00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.530]  And I can almost guarantee that nobody knew that on the Trump team.
[00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.849]  This happened and then the firing of these weapon systems over the last 24 hours.
[00:41:40.969 --> 00:41:45.920]  And it's just like I... I wrote about in the longer analysis that I provided.
[00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:56.780]  If these types of weapon systems were put in Mexico and they could target Corpus Christi or Austin, Texas, where you're at, I think, you know, Tucson, I mean, what would we say about it?
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.800]  How would we respond to it?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:09.449]  And instead of people taking the peace agreement That, you know, or going to peace talks based on something that I know is on the table.
[00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.769]  And Putin has actually accepted having a conversation about these.
[00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.809]  Apparently Zelensky has not.
[00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:28.829]  So this White House, the Biden White House with Harris, They are not going to a peaceful transition of power here into the Trump presidency.
[00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:34.570]  This is a very, very dangerous stage that we have been taken to.
[00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.969]  And I, you know, I'm concerned.
[00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.829]  I'm concerned right now.
[00:42:37.929 --> 00:42:41.690]  Trump is going to have to get on the phone with world leaders now and start.
[00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:48.849]  And he's probably going to have to put himself into the presidency, into the president mode, even though there's like we always say, there's only one president at a time.
[00:42:48.969 --> 00:42:52.909]  But Trump needs to say we need to have cool heads prevail here.
[00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.230]  We cannot have these provocative measures taken.
[00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.889]  And I wrote about this in the paper as well.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:10.039]  That this is what happened to me in 2016 in my very famous phone call with the Russian ambassador, Ambassador Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Russia.
[00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:17.239]  And I had to phone call with him and I said, and I verbally, I mean, almost specifically said, we got to let cool heads prevail here.
[00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:28.099]  Let the Trump administration come into office and we'll have a different conversation because we view things completely differently than the Obama administration.
[00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:29.719]  And you saw what happened to me.
[00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:33.739]  I mean, they lied through their teeth about that.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.440]  Well, the same thing is going to start to happen in here.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:48.099]  But we have to have conversations where sane people Leaders with good common sense who do not want to take us into World War III prevail.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:57.179]  If we don't have that, we are going to have a very difficult couple of months here because at the end of the day, Putin has to make decisions for his own sovereignty.
[00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:12.030]  And when you start to think about the give and take here, there's going to be a give and it's going to come from You know, the Russian side of the lines here because we have provoked them.
[00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.050]  The provocation has come from us, not from the Kremlin.
[00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.769]  And that's what I want people to understand.
[00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.969]  And General, a limited time we have with you...
[00:44:21.989 --> 00:44:25.190]  You're one of the best people we could interview in the world on a subject like this.
[00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:28.730]  Obviously, most of it's classified doctrine and things, but a lot of it's public as well.
[00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.449]  Just to be clear, I've studied nuclear doctrines.
[00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:32.150]  It's fascinating.
[00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:32.849]  It's so dangerous.
[00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:34.690]  It's one of the things I've looked into deeply.
[00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:36.409]  But you alluded to this.
[00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.550]  If Russia did anything like this, we'd already be at full war with them.
[00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:43.909]  If they moved missiles up, and this is what their military has been warning about for a year.
[00:44:44.269 --> 00:44:58.280]  Putin said two months ago, he said, if you move missiles, Nuclear-capable missiles that they can swap out with hydrogen warheads in 10 minutes and you start firing these conventional missiles in, we know that that will train us to accept a strike by these.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:12.239]  Even if we accept that in the escalation, then they can easily load hydrogen bombs on them and then we won't know when those get launched and they'll take out Our response systems, and we know the U.S. has a first strike policy.
[00:45:13.039 --> 00:45:18.980]  Russia has changed to a first strike policy just now, and I have the policy here from the Pentagon right in front of me.
[00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:25.980]  I know you know about it, but for listeners, yes, we have a first strike policy if the president decides so, but we don't have a president right now.
[00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:32.940]  We have a cabal, and it's headless and flailing around and thinks it can do things like this and not have repercussions.
[00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:47.389]  And from my studying of history, and even what the different international groups that study nuclear threats, the International Atomic Scientist Group, all of them are saying this is the closest to midnight, meaning nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:45:47.469 --> 00:45:50.449]  This is a bigger danger than even the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:55.849]  And the fact is the Russians say they cannot accept this.
[00:45:55.909 --> 00:46:14.150]  And Putin said, as you mentioned in his announcement a few months ago and again yesterday, he said, if we see a large aerospace barrage Yeah.
[00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.329]  Let me just, a quick historical context.
[00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.010]  Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:46:20.269 --> 00:46:28.090]  When Russia was going to place, you know, potential nuclear weapons into Cuba, right?
[00:46:28.289 --> 00:46:32.949]  You know, I mean, this is a, there's some similarities here, is what I'm saying.
[00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:43.440]  So this idea about what you're describing as these You know, as the potential nuclear policies for competing nations.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.300]  And there are nations in Europe as well, right, that are part of this umbrella.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:57.420]  So, you know, when people say there's, you know, when they talk about tactical use of tactical nuclear weapons, and I think I've actually been on your show before talking about this.
[00:46:57.869 --> 00:47:01.630]  I tell people, look, there's no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.429]  The burst radius, the consequences of a nuclear attack and nuclear use of a weapon.
[00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:18.349]  So now you have a weapon system that's been provided to Ukraine, and the only way that they're able to use it in as sophisticated a way as they're using it is if they have our help.
[00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:20.929]  I mean, it's undeniable.
[00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.929]  So Putin is going to look at this whole thing.
[00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.389]  He hasn't had a phone call with Joe Biden in years.
[00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.250]  I mean, I think we've already shown that.
[00:47:30.789 --> 00:47:43.809]  Again, there is a peace agreement on the table, and we have provocation from Zelensky in terms of his verbiage and what he's saying.
[00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:47.489]  So we are having ourselves...
[00:47:48.239 --> 00:47:49.360]  And I brought it down there.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.000]  We are sleepwalking with Joe Biden at the helm.
[00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:56.000]  We are sleepwalking into World War III here, folks.
[00:47:56.219 --> 00:48:11.760]  And the potential for a nuclear exchange, which nuclear weapons have been on the table and discussed by NATO, been discussed by Joe Biden, and been discussed by Putin in the last year,
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.539]  year and a half, to include adjustments to the Russian nuclear policy.
[00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:25.070]  So when they make adjustments to their nuclear policy, so from the standpoint of what, you know, so what?
[00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:35.030]  Well, if I was back in the Defense Department, I would be tapping into every single intel resource to find out what is Putin doing with his nuclear arsenal?
[00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:46.670]  One other thing that I'll draw to your attention, Alex, and I put it on my ex-post this morning, there's an undersea nuclear cable that was cut Up in the Baltic Sea.
[00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:53.550]  Very, very interesting that that has been reported and described.
[00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:53.949]  Yeah.
[00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:59.010]  So you kind of say, okay, these are the kinds of things that happen.
[00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:02.449]  We used to call them in the military the road to war, right?
[00:49:02.909 --> 00:49:05.329]  Incidents, indicators, and events that happen.
[00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:05.969]  Escalators.
[00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.130]  Okay, what does this mean?
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.860]  Yeah, big, big deal.
[00:49:09.039 --> 00:49:15.760]  Because that particular cable, what we have to examine is, what does that cable, what is it used for?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.059]  Is it just a communications cable?
[00:49:18.239 --> 00:49:19.980]  Is it a censorship cable?
[00:49:20.119 --> 00:49:29.480]  I mean, I don't mean censorship, like eliminating something that you're saying, but is it a cable that does sensing at the bottom of the ocean?
[00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:33.579]  So there's a lot of activities playing out right now.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.079]  And when you look at somebody's nuclear arsenal, and there's the nuclear triad, right?
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:47.599]  Subs, ground-based, or basically CONUS-based in our case, or Russia-based, and then you have your bombers, right?
[00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:48.320]  Your bomber fleet.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.679]  Those are sort of the triad, and we both have them.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:50:01.539]  The other thing that I want to also bring out is I would be looking at where are the Chinese submarine fleet, and where's the Chinese...
[00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:05.840]  General, that's where I was going next.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.219]  I know you already know this.
[00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:09.519]  Putin has put their forces on high nuclear alert.
[00:50:09.659 --> 00:50:11.820]  They've been doing nuclear strike drills the last two weeks.
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.579]  After Zelensky shot his mouth off and said they were two weeks away from nukes.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.539]  So Zelensky's threatening that he may have nukes.
[00:50:19.239 --> 00:50:25.480]  And then you've got them rolling missiles up to the border and now hitting Russia with missiles that can quickly be swapped out with nukes.
[00:50:25.719 --> 00:50:30.800]  I mean, this doesn't look like they're trying to provocate Russia into something.
[00:50:32.389 --> 00:50:47.429]  No, Alex, this is, I mean, that's why in the title of that article that you just showed, we have got to show the world, and particularly the United States right now, must take a different posture.
[00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:51.269]  Otherwise, we're going to find ourselves with a consequence that is irreversible.
[00:50:51.769 --> 00:51:02.760]  I want to remind people, over the last hundred years, from the Bolshevik Revolution post-World War I, to this day, to this time frame, We have been in a couple of world wars.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.059]  We've been in some major, major regional wars.
[00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:07.940]  We've had the Cuban Missile Crisis, as I talked about earlier.
[00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:12.119]  We are now in another period of time where we're betting on that guy right there.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.880]  I mean, we're betting on this guy in a place called Ukraine.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:22.739]  And I think if everybody, you know, with any common sense has figured out, Ukraine is a money laundering sieve.
[00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:27.980]  And we are being taken to the cleaners and have been taken to the cleaners for far too long.
[00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:37.460]  And that's why President Donald J. Trump had the mandate that he did in the election, in our recent presidential election, to get us out of these wars, to fight for peace.
[00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:39.320]  General, in closing, I know you've got to go.
[00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:40.380]  You've been incredibly gracious.
[00:51:40.579 --> 00:51:42.019]  I hear you're going to be here probably in the studio next week.
[00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:44.059]  We're still here on multiple fronts.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.239]  Just in closing...
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.079]  To be clear, you hit the nail on the head here.
[00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:52.159]  We don't even know who's in charge, but we know it's Blinken.
[00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:53.420]  It's the Defense Department.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.739]  And they need to know that we know they're doing this.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.800]  And Biden said two months ago when he said, yeah, we've authorized the missiles, but I don't want the U.S. to get the blame.
[00:52:01.059 --> 00:52:02.500]  That's what Keira Starmer said.
[00:52:03.219 --> 00:52:04.460]  They're going to get the blame.
[00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:05.179]  They need to know.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:05.599]  We're aware.
[00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:07.340]  Do you agree with Don Jr.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:14.440]  and others saying the military-industrial complex wants to either start a war to create a crisis to keep Trump out or hand him a full-scale war?
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.920]  I mean, that's prima facie what's happening.
[00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:22.230]  Do you agree I 100% agree with the post that actually Don Jr.
[00:52:22.429 --> 00:52:23.150]  put out recently.
[00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:30.769]  I agree so much that I added it into the more detailed analysis that I provided.
[00:52:31.489 --> 00:52:33.309]  This is really...
[00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.849]  Seriously dangerous.
[00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.969]  We have the wrong guy in office.
[00:52:37.429 --> 00:52:39.389]  Kamala can do her constitutional duty.
[00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.849]  Show us what she's got.
[00:52:40.969 --> 00:52:43.130]  But I don't think she's got the capability.
[00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.889]  And Congress, they definitely need to act.
[00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.230]  And they need to act now.
[00:52:47.429 --> 00:52:51.630]  This conversation has to be taken up to a vastly higher level.
[00:52:51.809 --> 00:53:02.050]  And to make sure that people around the world, particularly Russia and China, understand that this is not something that the people of the United States voted for.
[00:53:02.269 --> 00:53:02.849]  Okay?
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:10.380]  And we are being led by- And sir, as you said, Biden said a year ago he hasn't talked to Putin since Putin invaded- In a couple of years.
[00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:11.119]  That's insane.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:11.519]  Right.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.400]  It's insane.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.820]  It's outrageous.
[00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:15.880]  It's outrageous.
[00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.139]  So, Alex, I gotta- Thank you.
[00:53:18.139 --> 00:53:18.719]  Thank you so much.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.460]  And hopefully I'll see you next week.
[00:53:20.719 --> 00:53:21.340]  God bless you, sir.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:21.719]  Thank you.
[00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:26.070]  We all need to pray right now, ladies and gentlemen, for peace.
[00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:33.530]  And again, let the deep state know, yeah, you can flood kids in and human traffic and get away with it because no one will say who's behind it.
[00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:35.289]  They all have plausible liability.
[00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:36.809]  You don't for nuclear war.
[00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:37.789]  Stop it.
[00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:40.389]  This is totally insane.
[00:53:40.389 --> 00:53:41.809]  I don't even have words to describe it.
[00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:48.010]  Listen, we're going to come back, cover all this other huge guests coming on, just massive, but listen to me carefully.
[00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.710]  I can't continue to operate without you.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.159]  I don't know what's going to happen to Infowars next week with these hearings.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.599]  I mean, what was done was criminal.
[00:53:56.599 --> 00:53:57.500]  We should get it back.
[00:53:58.199 --> 00:54:02.780]  Regardless, we have the Alex Jones Network set up at AJNLive on X. Follow us there.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.980]  Support our sponsor that's not owned by Infowars, not owned by me, that they can't shut down.
[00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:08.159]  Get great supplements.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.340]  Get great Patriot apparel.
[00:54:09.719 --> 00:54:10.340]  Get great...
[00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:18.090]  Fundraiser, limited edition posters for Trump and Infowars and all of it at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:18.269 --> 00:54:20.570]  I need your support now.
[00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.809]  We will stay on air barring nuclear war.
[00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:25.610]  Order the products.
[00:54:25.889 --> 00:54:26.889]  You heard Flynn.
[00:54:26.969 --> 00:54:29.329]  We need to get this up to the highest levels, and we're able to do that.
[00:54:29.409 --> 00:54:36.530]  We're able to get talking points that are saying out of the world, that's why they want us off the air, so that there's nobody that knows what's going on in the media.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.980]  Most Republicans are partying at Mar-a-Lago, you know, like they're the winners.
[00:54:41.159 --> 00:54:42.539]  No, the deep states launched their attack.
[00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:43.099]  Stop that.
[00:54:43.219 --> 00:54:45.260]  We've got to get through the 60 days we have left.
[00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:46.880]  So support us now.
[00:54:47.059 --> 00:54:47.940]  Get great products now.
[00:54:48.099 --> 00:54:49.019]  Take action now.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.239]  And none of it goes to the bad guys at the putrid onion.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.639]  It goes to keeping the show on.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.360]  Thealexjohnstore.com.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:55.920]  Go there now.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.760]  The products are incredible.
[00:54:57.199 --> 00:54:57.820]  Take action now.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:58.840]  This is about your future.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.000]  Your future hangs in the balance.
[00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:03.670]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:08.809]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.630]  The latest case was last week.
[00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:12.469]  The judge shut them down.
[00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:13.530]  They were thrown out of the building.
[00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.869]  Crimes were committed.
[00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.750]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:55:16.969 --> 00:55:18.630]  I've filed counter lawsuits.
[00:55:18.969 --> 00:55:19.829]  You name it.
[00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:22.170]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:23.949]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[00:55:24.429 --> 00:55:38.230]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.210]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.849]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[00:55:45.429 --> 00:55:51.130]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:52.190]  I don't even own that.
[00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.989]  It's the sponsor.
[00:55:53.369 --> 00:56:06.409]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:10.650]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:15.750]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[00:56:15.929 --> 00:56:17.610]  The Onion does not own me.
[00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:19.929]  They do not own the Alex Jones Store.
[00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:22.769]  So thanks for your past support.
[00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:23.809]  Get great products now.

[00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:41.929]  We are kicking New World Order ass and they are fighting us.
[00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:44.130]  I can beat them, but not without your help.
[00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:47.050]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.630]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:56:47.969 --> 00:56:49.389]  It's not owned by me.
[00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:51.269]  It's not owned by The Onion.
[00:56:51.489 --> 00:56:53.090]  It's not owned by The Easter Bunny.
[00:56:53.250 --> 00:57:01.090]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[00:57:01.269 --> 00:57:03.329]  It's the alicejonesstore.com.

[00:57:17.199 --> 00:57:18.440]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:19.380]  We're fighting hard.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.400]  We're winning.
[00:57:20.599 --> 00:57:22.199]  But the fight is close.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:27.619]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:57:47.170 --> 00:58:02.190]  A new court date of November 25th, 2024 has been set to settle the flagrant misuse of the bankruptcy auction system by backers of The Onion that attempted to buy Infowars or free speech systems.
[00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:17.769]  First United American Companies and The Onion both submitted initial bids For the assets of Free Speech Systems, with FUAC bidding $1.2 million and The Onion bidding $1 million,
[00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:21.650]  both deemed qualified by the trustee.
[00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:26.750]  Initially, an online live auction was scheduled for November 13, 2024.
[00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:41.690]  But this was unexpectedly changed to a secret final and best bid process by the trustee without court approval, violating the sale order, which stipulated changes must be announced at the auction.
[00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:51.130]  FUAC's final bid increased to $3.5 million, while the onions increased to $1.750,000.
[00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:58.110]  Yet, the trustee accepted the onions bid as the winning one, despite the procedural discrepancies.
[00:58:58.909 --> 00:59:10.469]  The controversy deepens with the introduction of a Distributable Proceeds Waiver, a DPW, by the Connecticut families, which was meant to enhance the Onion's bid.
[00:59:10.769 --> 00:59:39.039]  This DPW, however, does not contribute any actual financial value to the bankruptcy estate, functioning only on the assumption that the Connecticut families could dictate the assets distribution as if they owned FSS. The DPW's value was contingent and based on the assumption of what the families might receive from FUAC's bid,
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:45.619]  essentially reshuffling potential distributions rather than adding to the estate's assets.
[00:59:46.289 --> 01:00:00.929]  The trustee's acceptance of this non-cash conditional element as part of the onions' bid raises significant questions about not only the auction process's fairness, but the actual existence of fraud utilized during the process.
[01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:04.289]  Alex, what it is, it's bid rigging is what it is.
[01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.170]  That's exactly what they've been caught doing.
[01:00:06.409 --> 01:00:14.469]  So there was never any honest above board auction in which legitimate bids were weighed or analyzed.
[01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:18.219]  And based on the rules, That we read.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:27.179]  First, you had to pre-qualify by demonstrating that you really had the cash to make the transaction if your bid was accepted.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.780]  As I told you, I put in sweat equity.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.380]  I have no money, but I do have knowledge and I have friends.
[01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:46.179]  And we put together, I think, a very solid bid with good people who understand Infowars and how it works and understand how the platform could go forward and continue to be the tip of the spear.
[01:00:46.530 --> 01:01:00.429]  Then we hear that the people from The Onion come along, they make a bid, but their bid is based on some vague promise of future cash that we may get from Alex Jones when he's finally, we extract every penny out of him.
[01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:07.710]  So they didn't put up an all-cash bid, but they seem to have some inside deal with the bankruptcy trustee.
[01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:11.900]  This is an outrage, but I think justice is gonna be done here.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.719]  One or two things needs to happen.
[01:01:14.019 --> 01:01:24.840]  They need to have a new legitimate auction for these assets that is carefully monitored to demonstrate that it is honest and it's above board.
[01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:32.360]  Or they have to take and throw out their bid and take our bid because I believe we're the only other viable bidder.
[01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:34.659]  There are only two possibilities here.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.760]  It has to be one or the other.
[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:48.030]  An email from the auction company, Tranzen, stated that the initial bids were so complex that they necessitated a complete unauthorized change in the auction process.
[01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:51.250]  They sent a new bid form with instructions.
[01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:58.050]  The new bid procedure and instructions were not announced at the live auction as required by the sale order.
[01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:08.630]  The change in the sale order was never communicated to FUAC's counsel or the court until after the fact, a clear violation of the auction rules.
[01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:13.489]  Instead, the process was cloaked in secrecy and sabotage.
[01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:21.969]  Again, a new court date of November 25th, 2024 has been established by the federal court in Houston, Texas.
[01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.650]  One final note.
[01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:37.369]  The Infowars crew were rushed out of the building following the auction on November 14th when the court document clearly states that there would be a wind-down process and another auction in December.
[01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:45.050]  The trustee had led most of the staff to believe that we had until the end of December to prepare for being unemployed.
[01:02:45.530 --> 01:03:00.340]  All right, Vladimir Putin has officially come out and said that The bombing of Russia by the United States through NATO with high-powered, long-range, nuclear-capable missiles is an act of war that Russia is at war with the United States.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.260]  I'll show you all the articles.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:19.420]  General Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, just came out on my broadcast last hour and Just about 15 minutes ago, he was on with us or less and said this is the closest to nuclear war we've ever been.
[01:03:19.639 --> 01:03:20.880]  This is an absolute crisis.
[01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:22.340]  Biden is not the president.
[01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:32.940]  Biden is a total puppet.
[01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:48.099]  And Kamala Harris has gone on vacation to Hawaii, and the deep state is using Ukraine as the potential detonator for World War III and nuclear conflict.
[01:03:50.179 --> 01:03:53.900]  Russia has said over and over again, if you move hypersonic missiles to our border...
[01:03:54.619 --> 01:03:56.260]  And you start firing them at us.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.699]  We don't know if there's hydrogen bombs on them.
[01:03:59.079 --> 01:04:05.400]  And if we don't fire our nuclear weapons, you can decapitate us under U.S. policy.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.460]  I'm going to explain this in a moment.
[01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:19.300]  But I will assure leftists that think there are no X and Y chromosomes and two men can have a baby and your main goal is to cut little boys' penises off.
[01:04:20.659 --> 01:04:22.780]  That we are close to all dying.
[01:04:23.139 --> 01:04:25.239]  You psychotic nutjobs.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.719]  So, that's where we are.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:36.579]  And I'm going to explain all the doctrine and the facts coming up.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:46.960]  Then we have a special guest who is the head of the Orthodox Church in Canada.
[01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:58.929]  Coming up in about 25 minutes here on the broadcast, we then have Dr.
[01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:14.269]  Francis Boyle, who's a former top UN prosecutor, who also wrote the U.S. chemical and biological weapons laws.
[01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:17.750]  Who knows what he's talking about.
[01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.690]  Who was the first to expose the entire COVID operation in January of 2020.
[01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:27.289]  On where we are and the fact that he's already drawn up and make sure we get a copy of it.
[01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:30.889]  I'm going to post it on X. Because it's breaking now.
[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:33.389]  The articles of impeachment for Biden.
[01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:37.469]  And you heard General Flynn call for it last hour.
[01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:39.690]  Thomas Massey has called for it in Congress.
[01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:44.789]  Trump needs to immediately have a press conference.
[01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:48.869]  He needs to immediately come out and say the mandate of the people is not to escalate this war.
[01:05:49.969 --> 01:05:53.989]  He needs to tell Putin to call for a ceasefire immediately.
[01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.429]  Or the globalists are going to start World War III in the next 62 days before Trump gets into office.
[01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.650]  And General Flynn agreed that is their plan.
[01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:07.170]  You might want to listen to him, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:10.150]  So...
[01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:14.340]  That's the military's main intelligence agency.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.539]  So...
[01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:24.099]  You heard Flynn 100% agree with me because I've studied this a lot.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.280]  A lot.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:33.679]  I'll guarantee you more than the people that are doing this because all of the advisors, they've been in the Washington Post, told Biden...
[01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:41.230]  Do not give these missiles to Ukraine, which are really run by the United States and NATO. Do not start bombing Russia, and they explain why.
[01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.210]  And he decided to not do it when he said he was two months ago.
[01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:55.269]  Now that lunatic supposedly gave this order, and the missiles started raining down today inside Russia.
[01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.510]  I'm going to show you the nuclear doctrine.
[01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:00.889]  I'm going to go over it all in a moment.
[01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.989]  But first, I have to keep announcing this, because...
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.619]  We survived their attempted takeover on May 31st without a court order.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:15.380]  The Justice Department, who's assigned to my federal case, most people don't know the Justice Department can be involved in bankruptcies when they want to be.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:23.199]  I played the clips of the former Deputy Attorney General explaining this several times last week and saying it looks illegal to him.
[01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:25.840]  Now the documents are out, it's confirmed.
[01:07:27.699 --> 01:07:30.039]  They ordered the place closed May 31st without an order.
[01:07:30.239 --> 01:07:33.460]  People thought I made that up until they were in court weeks later saying, yeah, we did it.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.199]  The judge fired them.
[01:07:34.519 --> 01:07:39.119]  The judge can fire them, but the feds can put another one in and he has to fire them, which is coming, I believe.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.340]  If not at the hearing Monday, he'll may order a larger hearing, but that's what's set in Houston.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.699]  In six days, seven days.
[01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.429]  So this is emblematic of all the tyranny you see and the vigilantism.
[01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:55.789]  The new trustee had a fake auction that wasn't even authorized.
[01:07:55.789 --> 01:08:02.449]  The judge said last week at the emergency hearing Thursday, he didn't even know there had been an auction, that it wasn't an auction.
[01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:03.289]  We got the documents.
[01:08:03.849 --> 01:08:07.170]  They told the other bidders, you can only give cash.
[01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:10.409]  You cannot promise credit or anything else.
[01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:14.409]  And then they gave it to people that bought Infowars on credit.
[01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:16.689]  So on its face, it's not fair.
[01:08:16.869 --> 01:08:18.130]  And it wasn't an auction.
[01:08:18.489 --> 01:08:24.810]  And the documents have all been published in a lawsuit filed yesterday by the real bidders.
[01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:26.689]  That is right here.
[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.170]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:30.369]  This is on X if you want to see it.
[01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:38.270]  And then here is my emergency restraining order and lawsuit filed early in the morning today.
[01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.270]  All the documents are in here.
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.109]  They're handwritten notes, the fake auction.
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.229]  All of it.
[01:08:47.409 --> 01:08:49.890]  And the Onion, that's really the front group.
[01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:50.630]  I told you this.
[01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:51.329]  I said it was the Democrats.
[01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:52.090]  Well, now they admit.
[01:08:52.890 --> 01:09:10.369]  It's the Everytown, Maine Soros funded gun control group that said we're going to confuse people about Alex Jones' identity.
[01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:15.689]  We're going to use clips of him and say we're him to destroy his brand.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.960]  And just their announcement that they own us last week has cut funds by 55%.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:30.319]  And our listeners have emailed us and said, we don't want to buy products at thealexjohnstore.com because we don't want it going to them.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.100]  They don't own thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.159]  They don't own the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:09:36.199 --> 01:09:36.600]  Let me say it again.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.300]  They don't own the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:09:47.159 --> 01:09:51.720]  Let me say it again.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:55.359]  They don't own the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.279]  That is owned by Bigly.
[01:09:58.989 --> 01:10:02.130]  That are a well-established top producer of Trump gear and more.
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:07.930]  And big sponsors of Stephen Crowder, the Hodge twins, and more than 100 other broadcasts.
[01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:10.189]  They put on major events around the country.
[01:10:10.369 --> 01:10:12.010]  They're patriots in Arkansas.
[01:10:12.289 --> 01:10:13.229]  That's where this is all made.
[01:10:13.329 --> 01:10:15.350]  The knives, the clothing, all of it.
[01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:18.270]  The supplements of private label top brands and shipped out of Arkansas.
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:27.109]  So, when you buy products there, you keep the Alex Jones backup network, AJN Live, there.
[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.909]  And they sponsor InfoWars.
[01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:33.149]  In the meantime, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.
[01:10:33.869 --> 01:10:40.489]  So, I don't know if you should go get something at InfoWars.com, at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:41.550]  I don't know what's going to happen with that.
[01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:46.770]  I'd say 99% chance if there's any legal or law in this country, we get the company back next week and the real bidder gets it.
[01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:53.289]  The judge said he's very upset there wasn't an auction and everybody should be upset about what happened and shouldn't be comfortable with it.
[01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.750]  Those are quotes.
[01:10:56.069 --> 01:11:01.439]  So, That's where we are.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.220]  I need to get into all the World War III news now.
[01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:11.239]  And we already knew it damaged us in the lawsuit that was filed at 2.30 in the morning last night.
[01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:17.800]  But they've done some other things I'm not going to announce yet because we're going to get all our ducks in a row.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.039]  But this is exactly what I told the lawyers and the crew and everybody.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.279]  I said, they're going to stage this auction.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:23.880]  No, no, they're not.
[01:11:23.939 --> 01:11:24.460]  That's a felony.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.119]  You can watch.
[01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:26.970]  I said, they'll be here Thursday.
[01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.590]  I said, this on Monday.
[01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:28.750]  They'll be here Thursday, shutting us down in the morning.
[01:11:28.829 --> 01:11:29.829]  Probably, I said, about 8 a.m.
[01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:30.970]  Showed up exactly 8 a.m.
[01:11:31.529 --> 01:11:33.229]  I just, this is all I do, folks.
[01:11:33.409 --> 01:11:33.869]  I know what I'm doing.
[01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:39.489]  And then I said, they're going to pull this.
[01:11:40.569 --> 01:11:41.250]  And they did.
[01:11:41.369 --> 01:11:42.750]  I'm not going to announce what it looks like.
[01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:43.750]  We know it was pulled.
[01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:48.569]  And I would expect a lot more now.
[01:11:49.210 --> 01:12:00.390]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if Right now, I want security increased tenfold.
[01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:01.170]  Give the order right now.
[01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.810]  I want ten times the security here armed.
[01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.649]  Get them in here right now.
[01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:06.409]  That's my order.
[01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:07.229]  Get them in here right now.
[01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.829]  I did that.
[01:12:07.909 --> 01:12:08.510]  Just clicked right there.
[01:12:09.109 --> 01:12:13.050]  So, they're getting ready to start World War III. They do not want us on the air when they do this, okay?
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.779]  So this is the CIA running all of this in the Justice Department.
[01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:18.800]  It all came out in court.
[01:12:18.979 --> 01:12:21.560]  So we are taking on the deep state at point blank range.
[01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:26.880]  We are defending all of you and your families and the very existence of this nation and our life on earth as we know it.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:33.279]  So I'm going to tell you again, if you care about your own future, this is not all the other shows.
[01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:34.840]  This is not entertainment.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.680]  This isn't the NFL. This is Americans that know what's going on.
[01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:46.840]  You heard the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former top national security advisor to Trump agreeing with every damn thing I just said last hour for 30 minutes.
[01:12:48.119 --> 01:12:51.439]  We'll have the head of the Canadian Orthodox Church on next.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.760]  We're going to have Victor Boot on.
[01:12:56.899 --> 01:12:59.319]  We're going to have Dr.
[01:12:59.659 --> 01:13:05.579]  Francis Boyle on, the former head of the UN's war crimes division.
[01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:07.739]  I'll tell you, this is a war crime.
[01:13:08.539 --> 01:13:10.979]  So we're not playing games here.
[01:13:10.979 --> 01:13:13.079]  I'm not making any of this up.
[01:13:15.479 --> 01:13:25.560]  You are insane if you don't go to the AlexJoneStore.com and support us and get the limited edition fundraiser, t-shirts, the posters, the supplements, all of it.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.659]  It's badass products and we're badass fighting for everybody here.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.359]  And we create the talking points for everybody else.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.520]  We are the fount.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.439]  We are the people to say it first.
[01:13:38.439 --> 01:13:41.279]  We create the truthful narratives against the lies.
[01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:46.829]  Go now to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:13:46.949 --> 01:13:49.109]  Become a VIP. $30 a month.
[01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:50.949]  You get $40 to spend on the store each month.
[01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:53.350]  Yeah, you want to do that?
[01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:54.869]  I need funds.
[01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:57.350]  I'm suing these people up one side and down the other.
[01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.369]  We will win.
[01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:00.029]  They are so pissed.
[01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:02.949]  They're on air saying, don't send him money.
[01:14:02.949 --> 01:14:03.630]  He's going down.
[01:14:03.909 --> 01:14:06.170]  Well, if you believe that Jedi mind trick, we will!
[01:14:08.329 --> 01:14:12.170]  There's one variable on whether I keep fighting, and that's you!
[01:14:14.069 --> 01:14:15.569]  Keep me in the fight now!
[01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:29.689]  I'd say go to fightforalex.com and give some go.
[01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.850]  But for the first time in its great history, it got hacked.
[01:14:34.329 --> 01:14:41.510]  The account yesterday had taken down, and they put on it, property of the onion, don't give money to Alex Jones.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.340]  Gibson goes, not the property of the Onion.
[01:14:44.899 --> 01:14:46.899]  My legal defense fund is the property of the Onion.
[01:14:47.119 --> 01:14:50.039]  The Onion didn't get this place, and if they did, they wouldn't get my legal defense funds.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.020]  Oh, I wonder who did that.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.600]  I wonder who.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:03.020]  The trustee was in here Tuesday, and they hooked up to the computer office.
[01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:13.350]  Of the one computer that had the passcode on it for that, even though we'd erased it with a factory reset, the code doesn't matter to it.
[01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:17.930]  Because it's not very nice folks we're dealing with.
[01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:19.949]  I'm not saying they did that.
[01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:20.810]  No, they're angels.
[01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:23.569]  They just ordered the place illegally shut down on May 31st.
[01:15:23.609 --> 01:15:30.810]  They just fraudulently turned the internet off last Thursday and told everybody to get out of the building and told the judge his employees will steal the equipment.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.340]  They just accused us of being criminals.
[01:15:33.479 --> 01:15:34.899]  Well, we don't accuse.
[01:15:34.899 --> 01:15:39.560]  We put the documents in multiple lawsuits in federal court.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.579]  How do you like that?
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:49.899]  I want ten times the security here right now.
[01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:55.890]  The federal trustee has proven himself to be derelict, to exceed his authority.
[01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:58.069]  He has no authority over this company.
[01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:03.649]  I'm the single member owner of InfoWars, and I am ordering 10 times the security here now.
[01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:10.409]  Because I know the bad guys, and I know their next move before they've decided to even do it.
[01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:13.989]  They're so scared of us right now.
[01:16:13.989 --> 01:16:16.130]  We'll reach 100 million people today.
[01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.109]  100 million.
[01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:19.649]  You like that, New World Ordered?
[01:16:21.409 --> 01:16:26.329]  There's only one person getting bigger numbers than that, and that's Elon Musk, and we're not in competition with him.
[01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:27.810]  We're on the same team.

[01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:36.010]  The enemy sees us as the main beacon.
[01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:41.789]  Will you keep the lighthouse on for the ships at sea in the storm?
[01:17:42.109 --> 01:17:43.670]  Now is the time for action.
[01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:50.890]  drjonesnaturals.com The AlexJonesStore.com The scumbags that claim they own this place with no evidence?
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.159]  To have no claim on drjonesnaturals.com.

[01:17:57.779 --> 01:17:58.779]  Zero, zero, zero.
[01:17:59.039 --> 01:18:05.680]  And they are watching and they're angry and they hate it that we have the funds and the support to stand against their bullying tyranny.
[01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:07.659]  And that we will never surrender.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.180]  And we have an infectious spirit of liberty.
[01:18:12.699 --> 01:18:13.619]  So we're here.
[01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:18.199]  The fuse has already been lit for World War III nuclear Armageddon.
[01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:23.159]  And we will stop it with God's help and your action together.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.039]  But now is the moment in history for action.
[01:18:26.579 --> 01:18:33.960]  Take the live feed from Infowars.com forward slash show, band out video, real all shows on X, and share those live feeds on your text message or email by word of mouth.
[01:18:34.039 --> 01:18:36.960]  Repost it everywhere like your future depends on it because it does!
[01:18:37.909 --> 01:18:45.689]  Did you hear General Flynn saying we've got to maximize this message and get it all the way through and through Trump, who we were already talking to, and out everywhere?
[01:18:46.069 --> 01:18:47.270]  This is the big issue.
[01:18:47.409 --> 01:18:50.109]  This is their move to stop us saving America and the world.
[01:18:50.289 --> 01:18:51.689]  This is the globalist move.
[01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.369]  World War III, it's here!
[01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:58.649]  And when they shot us down criminal last week and it blew up in their face and they said, oh, you can come back.
[01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:59.890]  They didn't give us the authorization.
[01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:01.010]  It was ours anyways.
[01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:09.560]  When they did that, I said, they're about to start probably a huge war.
[01:19:09.739 --> 01:19:11.000]  Have the archivist find it from Thursday.
[01:19:11.239 --> 01:19:13.420]  I said it at the Alex Jones Network studios.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.199]  I said, they're about to launch a big war.
[01:19:15.579 --> 01:19:16.899]  They're about to launch a big war.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.960]  They're about to start bombing Russia.
[01:19:18.159 --> 01:19:20.899]  They're going to launch a cyber attack next and say Russia did it.
[01:19:21.279 --> 01:19:22.399]  Go get the video.
[01:19:22.659 --> 01:19:27.100]  I told a million, ten, fifty, eighty million people probably saw it Thursday and Friday.
[01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:29.699]  You going to listen to me now?
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.800]  Or after we're all dead?
[01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:35.600]  Here's a short clip.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.180]  I'm gonna get into the latest World War III news.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.060]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[01:19:41.659 --> 01:19:46.199]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[01:19:46.479 --> 01:19:48.020]  The latest case was last week.
[01:19:48.539 --> 01:19:49.859]  The judge shut them down.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.920]  They were thrown out of the building.
[01:19:51.439 --> 01:19:52.260]  Crimes were committed.
[01:19:52.539 --> 01:19:53.199]  It's very clear.
[01:19:53.359 --> 01:19:54.119]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.979]  I filed counter lawsuits.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.199]  You name it.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.560]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.340]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:15.640]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.600]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.260]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:28.529]  The Onion didn't get Infowars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[01:20:28.529 --> 01:20:29.590]  I don't even own that.
[01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:30.390]  It's the sponsor.
[01:20:30.729 --> 01:20:43.819]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:53.119]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:55.029]  The Onion does not own me.
[01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:58.449]  They do not own the alexjonesstore.com.
[01:20:58.609 --> 01:21:00.170]  So thanks for your past support.

[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.439]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.020]  I'm going to say it again.

[01:21:27.039 --> 01:21:28.659]  It's not owned by The Onion.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.479]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[01:21:30.659 --> 01:21:38.479]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[01:21:38.699 --> 01:21:40.680]  It's thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:55.829]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:21:55.989 --> 01:21:56.770]  We're fighting hard.
[01:21:56.989 --> 01:21:57.789]  We're winning.
[01:21:57.970 --> 01:21:59.590]  But the fight is close.
[01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:05.029]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:23.409]  You see that beautiful blue planet on screen?
[01:22:24.609 --> 01:22:28.210]  It's going to be in a giant nuclear winter of total death.
[01:22:28.409 --> 01:22:33.010]  It's going to make a zombie apocalypse look tame in comparison.
[01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:36.329]  If the nuclear war kicks off, we've never been closer.
[01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:37.310]  The fuse is already lit.
[01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:42.689]  We've got to dump a big water jug of water onto that fuse.
[01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.350]  We gotta cut that fuse.
[01:22:45.489 --> 01:22:46.710]  We gotta stop that.
[01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:48.010]  And what's General Flynn just say?
[01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:50.350]  Democrats must remove President Biden now.
[01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:52.409]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.050]  Share it like your future depends on it does.
[01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:59.050]  Congressman Massey says this is World War III, total insanity, war crimes.
[01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:01.649]  Biden must be removed by impeachment or 25th Amendment now.
[01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:12.989]  Russia says that NATO supplying these missiles and bombing Russia is at war with NATO. That's CNN. Donald Trump Jr.
[01:23:13.069 --> 01:23:18.390]  says military industrial complex seeks World War III before his father takes office and brings peace.
[01:23:20.069 --> 01:23:22.270]  German Chancellor says it needs to stop.
[01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:28.109]  Now, reportedly, the Chinese are the main suspects cutting the undersea cables.
[01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:32.529]  Sabotage not ruled out and break communications cables in Baltic Sea.
[01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:36.810]  Sweden tells citizens prepare for war, nuclear war.
[01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:41.930]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:45.149]  Now Russia's updated its nuclear doctrine to this.
[01:23:46.949 --> 01:23:56.289]  First strike if a large aerospace attack is launched by missiles and aircraft, they have to believe that's nuclear.
[01:23:56.569 --> 01:24:05.640]  They then have to strike because if they are nuclear-tipped missiles, They could have their response knocked out, and that's U.S. doctrine too.
[01:24:05.939 --> 01:24:10.739]  A whole bunch of missiles get fired at the U.S. The U.S., and it's come from Russian submarines.
[01:24:10.739 --> 01:24:12.680]  We go to nuclear war like that.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.380]  And now this has been done.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:20.899]  So the globalists are trying to start World War III. Here's Wikipedia for you.
[01:24:22.039 --> 01:24:23.920]  No first use Wikipedia.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.060]  And then you turn to the United States, and it says the United States does have a first use.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:31.859]  Alright?
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.460]  And here is the blow-up of it.
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.899]  Yes, the United States has a nuclear first-strike policy.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:46.560]  The U.S. has not adopted a no-first-use policy, that means a first-use, and reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first in the event of conflict.
[01:24:46.739 --> 01:24:47.939]  And it goes through when?
[01:24:48.359 --> 01:24:51.039]  A whole bunch of missiles get fired at us and they don't know if they're nuclear.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.300]  We got a full nuclear war.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.800]  That's what happens with the Russians.
[01:24:55.399 --> 01:24:57.020]  That's what happens with anybody else.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.420]  That's standard doctrine.
[01:24:59.079 --> 01:25:02.060]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:02.479 --> 01:25:06.720]  I don't want anybody to ask me if I saw the soccer game or the NFL this weekend.
[01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:08.720]  People ask me that on the street.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.340]  I go, are you kidding me?
[01:25:11.119 --> 01:25:12.279]  I mean, are you joking?
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.520]  All right, folks.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.800]  Stay with us and share the links on X to the live feed right now.
[01:25:17.939 --> 01:25:18.779]  You're the Paul Revere's.

[01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:51.439]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[01:25:51.979 --> 01:26:04.840]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[01:26:05.649 --> 01:26:15.409]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[01:26:16.069 --> 01:26:22.289]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:25.289]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:33.569]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.

[01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:20.470]  President Biden is not the president.
[01:27:20.649 --> 01:27:22.430]  He is the front man for globalist cabal.
[01:27:22.609 --> 01:27:29.050]  I predicted they would start bombing Russia sometime during the time that President Trump was president-elect.
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:38.979]  To create a global crisis, and bare minimum, hand him a giant war, if not World War III. A nuclear World War III. True, fiery Armageddon.
[01:27:39.939 --> 01:27:45.600]  And General Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was on last hour saying this is the closest nuclear war we've ever been.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:50.920]  That the people calling the shots, Blinken and others at the State Department need to be criminally charged.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.380]  Members of Congress, the Senate, now others are calling for...
[01:27:56.809 --> 01:28:00.109]  We're good to go.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:28.119]  Gabriel's bio and breakdown, head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Canada.
[01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:32.399]  He is obviously close to Putin.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.779]  And here's some of the reports on that.
[01:28:34.979 --> 01:28:38.100]  The Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin's hidden influence campaign on the West.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:38.500]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.479]  Like not winning World War III. And so we have a great spokesperson here that knows the facts.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.739]  He can give us his breakdown on what's happening.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.319]  And...
[01:28:48.869 --> 01:28:50.149]  He joins us now.
[01:28:51.069 --> 01:28:53.329]  So, sir, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.989]  Archbishop.
[01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:55.789]  Thank you.
[01:28:56.029 --> 01:28:56.350]  How are you?
[01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.949]  Good.
[01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.670]  You've got the floor.
[01:28:57.810 --> 01:28:58.829]  What is your view on this?
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:00.930]  What can we do to try to stop a nuclear war?
[01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:07.409]  Well, first, I must start by saying I can't say that I'm really close to Putin.
[01:29:07.529 --> 01:29:14.930]  I have met the president a couple of times, and so have our bishops, but there's no real contact between.
[01:29:15.289 --> 01:29:18.189]  So you're saying that's another corporate media spin?
[01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:20.199]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:28.300]  So, but with regards to what's going on, you know, I think it's craziness and I think it was Donald Trump Jr.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:42.210]  who said that, you know, the people who are responsible for this, if indeed this If the current government gave the go-ahead to launch these missiles, you know, it's just idiocy.
[01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:56.470]  Because Putin and his government, as we've heard a number of times, and if you follow the Russian news, which I do as well, You know, they have said a number of times that they don't want escalation.
[01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:57.189]  They want peace.
[01:29:57.409 --> 01:30:10.829]  And so it would behoove, you would think, that the current government, especially in their last months, to work towards this goal, that is, to work towards peace, and having the two sides to sit down and negotiate.
[01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:14.449]  This is not happening.
[01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:36.300]  This directive coming, it seems like it came from Washington because even though only the New York Times is reporting this fact, but in any case it seems that Ukraine wouldn't do anything without Without the direct involvement of the West and the US first and foremost.
[01:30:36.939 --> 01:30:42.619]  So they've already launched six missiles, which were shot down by the Russians.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:48.880]  But if this continues, it certainly escalates the chance of war rather than the opposite.
[01:30:49.079 --> 01:30:53.920]  And so in that regard, I would say the sooner Trump comes to power, the better and safer we will all be.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:55.659]  Absolutely.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.640]  Well, Zelensky said three days ago, yeah, the missiles are coming.
[01:30:58.779 --> 01:30:59.439]  They'll speak for themselves.
[01:30:59.619 --> 01:31:00.439]  We want more missiles.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.939]  He's also threatened that he may have nuclear weapons to tip them with.
[01:31:04.279 --> 01:31:12.300]  And then if those missiles could be tipped by nukes, then what are the Russians supposed to do when these missiles start coming in on a routine basis?
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.960]  Just sit there and wait for a hydrogen bomb to detonate?
[01:31:15.079 --> 01:31:19.319]  That's why in Russia's nuclear doctrine, just the same as ours, a bunch of hypersonic missiles come in.
[01:31:19.439 --> 01:31:21.640]  They reserve the right to launch a nuclear counter-strike.
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:23.580]  Absolutely.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.359]  That's the thing.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.739]  And how can we be calm about this?
[01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:46.300]  I mean, everyone should be, you know, upset, as I think, you know, would be the least I could say, you know, with regards to people reacting to what's going on right now, because this does bring us closer to a possible third world war and nuclear war.
[01:31:46.659 --> 01:31:52.659]  And as Putin has said a number of times, and I remember once he gave an interview to, was it Stone?
[01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:59.329]  The producer, the movie producer, who said that, you know, no one wins in a nuclear war.
[01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:00.189]  No one wins.
[01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:03.569]  So what are we doing?
[01:32:03.869 --> 01:32:15.510]  You know, we should be really striving towards bringing the two sides, the warring sides, to the peace table and hoping that the good results can be achieved.
[01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:30.260]  And I have to say that, you know, With regards to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin has always said that they never wanted to actually take these measures to begin with.
[01:32:30.399 --> 01:32:48.649]  It's because for years and years, Russia's pleas were ignored by the West, and that is, of course, the expansion of NATO right at the doorstep of Russia's borders, but also with regards to what was going on in the Lugansk and the Donetsk regions, which refused to accept The Ukrainian government,
[01:32:48.869 --> 01:33:00.729]  which came to power after the revolution in 2014, and for a period of eight years, they were constantly shelled by the Ukrainians for refusing to recognize them.
[01:33:00.949 --> 01:33:17.289]  And so that's why the Minsk Accords came into effect in 2015, to try to somehow It was solved or helped the situation with regards to the Russian civilians that would be constantly being attacked by the Ukrainians.
[01:33:17.449 --> 01:33:19.350]  So Russia's hand was forced.
[01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:28.989]  I mean, eight years later, I think any other country and probably I would say the US and the Western countries would have gone to war much earlier, would have invaded much earlier.
[01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.350]  Russia waited for eight years.
[01:33:30.489 --> 01:33:31.689]  Nothing was resolved.
[01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:37.510]  No one was hearing what Russia was asking and pleading with.
[01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:41.029]  And so they were forced to invade in 2022.
[01:33:41.829 --> 01:33:53.949]  But all along, they've said, and if we remember in 2022, in April of 2022, two months after the invasion, Russia was set down at the peace table with Ukraine.
[01:33:54.170 --> 01:34:00.369]  But apparently Ukraine was convinced not to, to make peace with Russia and to continue the war.
[01:34:00.489 --> 01:34:05.010]  And here we are, hundreds of thousands of dead soldiers later, We continue.
[01:34:05.329 --> 01:34:07.390]  The madness continues.
[01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:15.510]  And now it's escalated to possible, you know, God forbid, another world war or nuclear war.
[01:34:18.409 --> 01:34:19.630]  This is...
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:31.939]  This is something that a lot of people have trouble dealing with because we've had relative peace in many parts of the world for so long, and we haven't all killed each other yet with nuclear weapons because of mutually assured destruction.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.140]  It's all been war-gamed.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:39.020]  It always ends with basically the majority of the world dead, bare minimum, and a total collapse of civilization.
[01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:46.239]  But all the mainline analysts agree this is the closest to midnight, meaning total nuclear war we've ever been, Archbishop.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:35:04.720]  You know, I mean, obviously, I know you're not going to start and advise people that aren't part of your church, but I'm a Christian as well, and Jesus Christ is my Savior, and I'm just constantly, right now, mentally praying to God to intervene and stop this.
[01:35:04.979 --> 01:35:16.159]  From your spiritual Christian perspective, what can we do, do you think, as Christians, to ask God to intercede and stop this, or have we just brought this on ourselves and we all get killed?
[01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:35.289]  Well, you know, as you said, prayer is very effective and we need to all be praying about peace and about this problem Being resolved in a peaceful manner, not by escalating the possibility of war.
[01:35:35.489 --> 01:35:37.930]  And that's why, of course, we need to pray.
[01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:43.569]  And our church does pray and has been praying all these years since the invasion of 2022.
[01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:49.850]  Because, you know, the Russians understand that the Ukrainians are our brothers.
[01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:53.210]  We come from the same, as they say, baptismal fund.
[01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:56.069]  You know, more than a thousand years ago.
[01:35:56.310 --> 01:36:06.210]  So it's a tragedy that so many of these soldiers have been killed, young men, and most of them probably didn't want to go to war in the first place.
[01:36:06.329 --> 01:36:14.050]  They were forced to, as we're seeing what is happening now in Ukraine, where they're actually just forcing people off the street into cars and sending them to the front lines.
[01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:19.930]  They're even conscripting some women and even Down syndrome individuals.
[01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:21.909]  Yeah, well, this is it.
[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.210]  Women.
[01:36:22.369 --> 01:36:23.890]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[01:36:24.609 --> 01:36:25.489]  Are they that desperate?
[01:36:25.869 --> 01:36:27.470]  Once again, what are we talking about?
[01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:38.869]  Are we talking about the need to somehow strive towards peace, or do we escalate the war and continue the war, and more and more, tens or hundreds of thousands more will be killed?
[01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:41.250]  Really, it's just madness.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.899]  You pointed out Don Jr.'s statement.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.899]  General Flynn agreed with it.
[01:36:44.939 --> 01:36:46.060]  So does Congressman Massey.
[01:36:46.119 --> 01:36:47.739]  And now senators are coming out saying he needs to stop.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.460]  After you leave, we'll get to those developments.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:37:00.199]  But clearly, this is the military-industrial complex trying to create a global crisis to keep Trump out in 62 days or hand him a total war.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:06.260]  What is your view on that, A? And then B, in the time we have, Putin, when he talked to Tucker Carlson, spent most of the two-hour interview...
[01:37:06.819 --> 01:37:07.800]  Giving him a history lesson.
[01:37:07.979 --> 01:37:10.739]  I've studied a lot of history, but I would probably butcher it.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:19.760]  But from what I researched, doesn't the Russian Orthodox Church, I know it goes back even further to right after Christ, the oldest Christian church in the world, and that's on record.
[01:37:20.319 --> 01:37:21.279]  But doesn't it...
[01:37:21.949 --> 01:37:33.310]  In the founding of what is the Russian culture, a thousand years ago, start in what is Ukraine today, and then that got conquered by outsiders, and then the Moscovites came down and liberated them.
[01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:37.390]  And I mean, isn't the birthplace of Russia really Ukraine?
[01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:52.069]  And so the idea, I mean, this is really a globalist-triggered civil war, Between not just Slavs, but between really Russians, and then trying to outlaw the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and trying to outlaw Ukrainian-speaking Russian.
[01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:55.329]  That'd be like in England, trying to outlaw the speaking of English, right?
[01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:56.529]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:56.729 --> 01:38:02.689]  I saw that interview with Tucker Carlson that Putin gave, and maybe it was good that he gave that short history lesson.
[01:38:02.869 --> 01:38:08.569]  Maybe it went on too long, but in any case, what he was trying to say is exactly what you just mentioned.
[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:23.890]  That is the fact that Back in 1988, when the Russians were baptized in Kyiv, which is now the capital, as we know, of Ukraine, there was no such even understanding of Ukraine.
[01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:25.930]  It was Kyiv and Rus, as it was called.
[01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:27.109]  That is Kyiv and Russia.
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:31.569]  And so that actual term probably came into...
[01:38:32.369 --> 01:38:34.569]  Into existence around the 17th century.
[01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:45.489]  So, yes, you know, we both come, like I said, from the same baptismal font, you know, Russians and Ukrainians or Ukrainians that exist today.
[01:38:45.829 --> 01:39:01.470]  So, of course, one has to ask, you know, who does it benefit to try to And make the Russians be at war with Ukraine or vice versa, Ukraine be at war with Russia.
[01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:08.189]  These are two, like I said, countries that go back to the same origins.
[01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:13.850]  And so really, and maybe it was another attempt to somehow weaken Russia.
[01:39:14.289 --> 01:39:20.609]  I don't know, but because, you know, Russia, of course, for the past 27 years has been growing in leaps and bounds economically.
[01:39:21.029 --> 01:39:29.590]  Now, I believe it holds the fourth spot after the U.S., India, and China.
[01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:33.489]  And so it has overtaken even Germany and Japan.
[01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:40.430]  So, obviously, this is maybe some see this as a threat, Russia's, you know, economic crisis.
[01:39:42.269 --> 01:39:43.670]  Emergence in the world.
[01:39:43.949 --> 01:39:49.050]  And I think, on the contrary, Russia does not want to be at war with anyone.
[01:39:49.670 --> 01:40:03.890]  And the lies that have been repeated continually by the West, and especially NATO countries, that Russia is going to after Ukraine, they're going to go into Europe, is just, once again, ridiculous.
[01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:06.289]  And that doesn't make sense.
[01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:09.369]  Russia wants peace with everyone, wants to work with everyone.
[01:40:09.829 --> 01:40:20.850]  And I think first and foremost, that should be the case with the U.S. Let's not forget, you know, Russia back in the 19th century helped the North in the civil war against the South.
[01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:31.390]  Russia always had very good relations with the U.S., maybe with the exception of, you know, the first decades of Soviet power.
[01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:32.289]  Well, that's right.
[01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:34.930]  And Russia sold us Alaska for nothing, basically.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:36.859 --> 01:40:37.539]  That too.
[01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:38.880]  So, I mean...
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.939]  And of course, you give the history lesson.
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:41.800]  I know you're very learned, sir, Archbishop.
[01:40:42.479 --> 01:40:45.699]  British intelligence manipulated the South into the war.
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:50.039]  The British intelligence was always trying to overthrow the Tsars, so that's why they intervened.
[01:40:50.619 --> 01:40:52.579]  And that's all in the mainline history books.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.180]  And again, I had ancestors that were in the South and were actually generals.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.239]  I'm a Southerner.
[01:40:57.359 --> 01:40:58.319]  I'm not attacking the South.
[01:40:58.479 --> 01:41:01.640]  But the South was manipulated into that war by British intelligence.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.300]  That's in the history books for people that don't know.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.399]  Right.
[01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:04.979]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:17.199]  And so the British intelligence is right at the center of the proxy war with Russia and Ukraine right now, and they are driving it came out, not having the peace deal that Zelensky was ready to do with Putin two plus years ago.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.039]  Right, exactly.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.680]  Apparently, Boris Johnson was the one that said to Ukraine to keep fighting.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.960]  So, once again, what are we talking about here?
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.880]  The fact that hundreds of thousands of soldiers have died as a result of that advice?
[01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:36.539]  Yeah, the numbers probably, sir, as you know, it's over 600,000 is the low estimate.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.640]  Yeah, right, probably.
[01:41:40.399 --> 01:41:42.539]  And as I said, once again, tragic, just tragic.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:51.260]  And now, when we have the chance to somehow achieve peace, certain sides are escalating in the war.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.239]  So like I said, the sooner Trump comes to power, the safer we will all be.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.500]  Sir, thank you for the time.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.939]  I want to give you the floor for another five minutes to say whatever you'd like to.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.779]  About 50 million people will see this conservatively.
[01:42:04.859 --> 01:42:07.479]  What would you like to say to them about what they can do to help stop this peacefully?
[01:42:08.829 --> 01:42:13.229]  Well, like I said, first and foremost, I think we should all be praying about peace.
[01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:16.550]  We should be praying that this is resolved as soon as possible.
[01:42:17.010 --> 01:42:36.109]  And we should be praying for the new president, the returning president, Donald Trump, that God give him wisdom and strength to understand what's happening in the world and to be strong against the powers that try to cause a war rather than peace.
[01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:38.649]  And right now, it's really critical.
[01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:48.600]  Because this is a very real threat, and a threat to mankind, to the existence of humanity.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:43:12.119]  So hopefully I think everyone needs to voice their concern, and I would say even one concern, their outrage that this could be happening, and to urge all of their local politicians and politicians in Washington to rethink the strategy Because there's still two months left of the present administration until Trump is inaugurated,
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.659]  but a lot could happen in those two months.
[01:43:14.859 --> 01:43:22.779]  So God forbid that, like I said, this continues to escalate and results in a war, and God forbid, a nuclear war.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:28.960]  So let us all pray for peace, but also let us not be silent about this.
[01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:31.029]  Well, thank you for not being silent.
[01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:33.130]  And I don't know the finer points.
[01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:36.569]  I know you're a very humble, oldest Christian faith.
[01:43:36.829 --> 01:43:40.750]  I mean, are you able to say a prayer, Archbishop, here on air for world peace right now?
[01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:42.090]  Or should we all just say that privately?
[01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:44.909]  I think we should just all say it privately.
[01:43:45.069 --> 01:43:47.729]  I don't know that I have a specific prayer right now.
[01:43:47.829 --> 01:43:52.689]  But I think, you know, when we pray from the heart, you know, that's when God really does hear us.
[01:43:53.329 --> 01:43:54.430]  And that's very important.
[01:43:55.130 --> 01:44:00.189]  A humble and a sincere prayer is something that is always heard.
[01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:02.229]  Thank you so much.
[01:44:02.409 --> 01:44:05.170]  And where's the best place for people?
[01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:06.029]  Is there a website?
[01:44:06.210 --> 01:44:07.250]  I know you guys have a lot of websites.
[01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:09.649]  Where's the best place for people to find out more about what you actually say?
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:22.060]  Well, you know, I can't say that I have a website, an official website, and sometimes people ask my opinion because I do like to follow the news here and in Russia and to make the comparisons.
[01:44:22.079 --> 01:44:27.979]  And so, you know, when I'm asked, I'm more than happy to talk about it and to share my opinions.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:36.300]  But, you know, we only have our church websites, which really don't talk about any, you know, the politics that we're talking about right now.
[01:44:36.619 --> 01:44:39.000]  Well, thank you for joining us at this greatest of times.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.600]  God bless you, Archbishop.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.079]  Thank you.
[01:44:41.619 --> 01:44:42.079]  Thank you, Alice.
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:42.739]  God bless you, too.
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:43.579]  Thank you.
[01:44:43.979 --> 01:44:47.640]  There goes Archbishop Gabriel, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church in Canada.
[01:44:48.319 --> 01:44:57.699]  I want to play a top professor, author, one of the most respected geopolitical analysts in the world, Jeffrey Sachs, a brief history of what's really happening in Ukraine.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.680]  Here it is.
[01:44:59.659 --> 01:45:06.800]  This is not an attack by Putin on Ukraine in the way that we are told every day.
[01:45:07.239 --> 01:45:13.060]  This started in 1990, February 9th, 1990.
[01:45:14.449 --> 01:45:34.930]  James Baker III, our Secretary of State, said to Mikhail Gorbachev, NATO will not move one inch eastward if you agree to German unification, basically ending World War II. And Gorbachev said that's very important.
[01:45:35.170 --> 01:45:40.130]  Yes, NATO doesn't move, and we agree to German unification.
[01:45:41.489 --> 01:45:54.350]  The US then cheated on this, already starting in 1994, when Clinton signed off on basically a plan to expand NATO all the way to Ukraine.
[01:45:54.609 --> 01:45:58.210]  This is when the so-called neocons took power.
[01:45:58.970 --> 01:46:02.850]  And Clinton was the first agent of this.
[01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:09.930]  And the expansion of NATO started in 1999 with Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic.
[01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:12.430]  At that point, Russia didn't much care.
[01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:15.170]  There was no border other than with the Konigsberg.
[01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:17.949]  But other than that, there was no direct threat.
[01:46:18.329 --> 01:46:23.630]  Then the US led the bombing of Serbia in 1999.
[01:46:25.090 --> 01:46:38.350]  That was bad, by the way, because that was a use of NATO to bomb a European capital, Belgrade, 78 straight days to break the country apart.
[01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:40.850]  The Russians didn't like that very much.
[01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:58.770]  Putin became president, they swallowed it, they complained, but even Putin started out pro-European, pro-American, actually asked maybe we should join NATO, when there was still the idea of some kind of mutually respectful relationship.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:07.060]  Then 9-11 came, then came Afghanistan, and the Russians said, yeah, we'll support you.
[01:47:07.159 --> 01:47:08.699]  We understand to root out terror.
[01:47:08.979 --> 01:47:12.920]  But then came two other decisive actions.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:18.800]  In 2002, the United States unilaterally walked out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty.
[01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:25.130]  This was probably the most decisive event, never discussed in this context.
[01:47:25.409 --> 01:47:36.920]  But what it did was trigger the US putting in missile systems In Eastern Europe that Russia views as a dire, direct threat.
[01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:45.140]  In 2004-5, we engaged in a soft regime change operation in Ukraine.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:55.319]  But in 2009, Yanukovych won the election and he became president in 2010 on the basis of neutrality for Ukraine.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:08.979]  That calmed things down because the US was pushing NATO, but the people of Ukraine on the opinion polls didn't even wanna be in NATO. They knew that the country is divided between ethnic Ukrainian, ethnic Russian.
[01:48:08.979 --> 01:48:10.239]  What do we want with this?
[01:48:10.399 --> 01:48:12.640]  We wanna stay away from your problems.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:21.899]  So in February 22nd, 2014, the United States participated actively in the overthrow of Yanukovych.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.319]  A typical U.S. regime change operation.
[01:48:26.739 --> 01:48:28.260]  Have no doubt about it.
[01:48:28.399 --> 01:48:30.300]  And the Russians did us a favor.
[01:48:30.619 --> 01:48:47.859]  They intercepted a really ugly call between Victoria Nuland, my colleague at Columbia University now, between her and the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Jeffrey Piat, who's a senior State Department official till today.
[01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:50.659]  And they talked about regime change.
[01:48:51.529 --> 01:48:53.210]  They said, who's gonna be the next government?
[01:48:53.550 --> 01:49:00.409]  All of this is to say, the US then said, okay, now NATO's really gonna enlarge.
[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:04.250]  And Putin kept saying, stop, you promised no NATO enlargement.
[01:49:04.789 --> 01:49:19.949]  It's been, by the way, I forgot to mention in 2004, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, seven more countries in the not one inch eastward.
[01:49:20.909 --> 01:49:41.850]  And then, okay, it's a long story, but the US kept rejecting the basic idea, don't expand NATO to Russia's border in a context where we're putting in goddamn missile systems after breaking a treaty.
[01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:45.609]  2019, we walked out of the Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:55.199]  On December 15, 2021, Putin put on the table a draft Russia-US security agreement.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  You can find it online.
[01:49:58.079 --> 01:50:02.199]  The basis of it is no NATO enlargement.
[01:50:02.579 --> 01:50:07.840]  I called the White House that next week after that.
[01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:11.890]  Begging them, take the negotiations.
[01:50:12.409 --> 01:50:14.909]  Putin's offered something, avoid this war.
[01:50:15.529 --> 01:50:17.750]  Oh, Jeff, there's not gonna be a war.
[01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:22.449]  Announce that NATO's not gonna enlarge.
[01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:24.710]  Oh, don't worry, NATO's not gonna enlarge.
[01:50:24.789 --> 01:50:28.909]  I said, oh, you're gonna have a war over something that's not gonna happen?
[01:50:29.949 --> 01:50:31.270]  Why don't you announce them?
[01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:33.590]  And he said, no, no, our policy is an open door.
[01:50:33.789 --> 01:50:34.729]  This is Jake Sullivan.
[01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:37.310]  Our policy is an open door policy.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:40.340]  Open door for NATO enlargement.
[01:50:40.779 --> 01:50:44.159]  That is under the category of bullshit, by the way.
[01:50:44.479 --> 01:50:51.020]  You don't have your right to put your military bases anywhere you want and expect peace in this world.
[01:50:51.239 --> 01:50:53.159]  They turned down the negotiations.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.039]  Then the special military operation started.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:02.180]  And five days later, Zelensky says, okay, okay, neutrality.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:07.460]  And then the United States and Britain said, no way.
[01:51:08.409 --> 01:51:09.829]  You guys fight on.
[01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:11.689]  We got your back.
[01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:13.569]  We don't have your front.
[01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:14.590]  You're all gonna die.
[01:51:15.069 --> 01:51:16.609]  But we got your back.
[01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:20.869]  As we kept pushing them into the front lines.
[01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:30.390]  That's 600,000 deaths now of Ukrainians since Boris Johnson flew to Kyiv to tell them to be brave.
[01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:46.310]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:51.890]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.779]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:51:56.279 --> 01:52:00.140]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:52:00.319 --> 01:52:00.779]  Who knows?
[01:52:01.319 --> 01:52:03.760]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:52:04.119 --> 01:52:18.420]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:52:18.909 --> 01:52:22.810]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:35.569]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:37.229]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[01:52:37.409 --> 01:52:52.010]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at theologyofthestore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:59.750]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in, but that's going to get announced the winner here in just a few days.
[01:52:59.869 --> 01:53:07.420]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, The Alex Jones Network will be on air, and so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.

[01:53:17.039 --> 01:53:22.500]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.

[01:53:24.119 --> 01:53:25.119]  It's a beautiful truck.

[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.359]  Central Standard Time.
[01:55:34.359 --> 01:55:45.979]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, November 19th, 2024 transmission to illustrate how desperate the times are and how desperate the globalist, psychotic, megalomaniac deep state is.
[01:55:46.199 --> 01:55:52.140]  On May 31st, the U.S. trustee assigned to my bankruptcy case ordered the shutdown of the building without a court order.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:56.140]  I refused to go when they sent armed security here to do it.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:01.060]  I told the armed security, you have to have a court order, and I refused to leave.
[01:56:01.119 --> 01:56:01.899]  I said, I'm going to call the police.
[01:56:02.159 --> 01:56:03.699]  They said, hey, we talked to the head of our company.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:04.000]  You're right.
[01:56:04.039 --> 01:56:05.159]  We don't know why we were told to do this.
[01:56:05.579 --> 01:56:08.239]  I've got a lady from the Justice Department saying I'm a Justice Department official.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.600]  You must do what I say.
[01:56:11.159 --> 01:56:13.899]  We put them on the line, and I said, you're committing crimes.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.760]  The judge had a hearing two weeks later and fired them, but the feds appointed another one.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.680]  They can come into bankruptcy cases.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:28.180]  He had a fake auction last week, gave it to the George Soros Everytown Brady Center Gun Control Group.
[01:56:28.399 --> 01:56:29.539]  The Onion is their front.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.100]  The judge had an emergency hearing, said, I didn't even authorize this sale yet.
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:34.920]  We had more hearings.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.640]  What the hell have you done?
[01:56:35.939 --> 01:56:37.640]  I'm ordering an evidentiary hearing.
[01:56:37.779 --> 01:56:38.739]  That's been set for Monday.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:47.279]  When they did that on May 31st, we're going to our guest, I said, this isn't about me.
[01:56:47.359 --> 01:56:48.239]  They're about to try to kill Trump.
[01:56:49.739 --> 01:56:54.140]  Because we have the guests on the show like Elon Musk and Dr.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:04.800]  Francis Boyle and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and the Archbishop of the Orthodox Church of Canada and Victor, I mean, you name it, they're on the show.
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:11.460]  And we create a global consensus about what's happening that gets picked up by everybody else.
[01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:14.689]  Now, 400 and plus stations now carry us.
[01:57:14.789 --> 01:57:16.949]  We've gotten more in the last few months with the Streisand effect.
[01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:18.289]  I don't want to go to Dr.
[01:57:18.569 --> 01:57:19.270]  Francis Boyle now.
[01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:23.090]  We'll go to him in about four minutes because those stations don't carry the first six.
[01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:26.149]  I want him to have the floor to be congruent and not be cut off.
[01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:33.289]  That's why I'm giving you just this personal story to understand how desperate the deep state is.
[01:57:34.449 --> 01:57:37.310]  Vigilantism from the Justice Department ordering our shutdown.
[01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:44.270]  In May, and then now again, coming to the building, we refused to leave this time.
[01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:50.350]  They already had the IT, internet service providers, cut off the website and cut off our internet service.
[01:57:50.489 --> 01:57:51.229]  We were off the air.
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:58:03.670]  So I said, fine, I'm going to drive four miles away, get in the cockpit of the Alex Jones network that has the broadcast studio edit, but it's got a whole studio almost done, so we could have guests and everything else.
[01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:09.029]  And we were back up on the satellites, radio stations, TV stations, all of it, without even a hiccup.
[01:58:09.659 --> 01:58:12.680]  It was like the first five minutes had a little problem because I wasn't there yet.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:14.659]  I walked in five minutes before the show started.
[01:58:16.170 --> 01:58:20.270]  And I was getting phone calls that they'd cut the internet off when I left the building.
[01:58:20.729 --> 01:58:22.750]  So that is desperate behavior.
[01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:27.949]  That CIA coup against America that they admit is in control of this with the State Department.
[01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:32.890]  General Flynn, the first hour, said, we need the 25th Amendment.
[01:58:32.949 --> 01:58:34.069]  We need impeachment of Biden.
[01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:37.729]  We need to let the State Department know that that's who's running this.
[01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:40.229]  And the CIA, you're going to get arrested when Trump gets in.
[01:58:40.409 --> 01:58:45.569]  This is absolute insane asylum coup.
[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.159]  There was a coup when they removed Biden.
[01:58:49.039 --> 01:58:50.880]  They installed Harris as the candidate.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:52.520]  They disappeared Biden for eight days.
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:54.399]  They put out a fake resignation letter.
[01:58:54.579 --> 01:58:55.039]  I said it.
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:55.739]  Trump said it.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:56.960]  Dana White said it.
[01:58:57.079 --> 01:58:59.520]  Two weeks before the election, he said, the coup's already in.
[01:58:59.779 --> 01:59:01.079]  They're not going to try to leave.
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:08.060]  And I said, if they can't steal the election, they will start World War III during the 76 days he's president-elect.
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:10.340]  We're now 61 and a half days out.
[01:59:11.449 --> 01:59:15.569]  So if you think these psychotics are going to just go away, think again.
[01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:25.829]  I'm just emblematic of any time there's a regime change and the CIA overthrows the government, they've got their beachhead, they cut off the communications of the group they're overthrowing.
[01:59:26.329 --> 01:59:28.029]  We are the legitimate Americans.
[01:59:28.029 --> 01:59:34.890]  We elected Trump to secure the border, to secure the dollar, to stop World War III, to stop all the frankenshots.
[01:59:36.529 --> 01:59:48.369]  And we have a coup now in place trying to start world war that is a political military gun to our head to terrorize the planet into some capitulation.
[01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:53.390]  Behind the scenes, you know they're calling Trump saying we're going to do this if you don't roll over.
[01:59:53.850 --> 01:59:54.789]  Guaranteed that's going on.
[01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:55.909]  That's exclusive, by the way.
[01:59:56.050 --> 01:59:57.010]  He's not going to roll over.
[01:59:57.289 --> 01:59:58.069]  What do we do?
[01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.850]  We'll talk to Dr.
[01:59:59.210 --> 02:00:00.069]  Francis Boyle straight ahead.
[02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:06.470]  I come to you in humanity's darkest hour, the International Atomic Energy Association.
[02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:23.529]  All the different top think tanks, RAND corporations, all the different groups, I already showed you hours of the documents and articles that General Flynn on First Hour, are all agreeing that we are the closest to thermonuclear war we've ever been.
[02:00:26.569 --> 02:00:34.210]  And NATO has rolled weapons up to the border of Russia that can, in 10 minutes, be fitted with hydrogen warheads.
[02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:41.029]  Hydrogen bomb payloads as a sneak attack to take out the Russian nuclear response.
[02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:46.090]  The United States has a nuclear first strike policy.
[02:00:46.449 --> 02:00:49.090]  Russia has changed theirs to a first strike policy.
[02:00:49.489 --> 02:01:01.489]  In Putin's words, two months ago and again this week, if they see a major aeronautics attack, Attack of aircraft, missiles, or both, they have to assume they are tipped with missiles.
[02:01:02.789 --> 02:01:06.550]  Biden, on Sunday, it came out in the New York Times, you now see that's accurate.
[02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:09.130]  Green lit, or whoever's in control up there.
[02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:17.170]  The bombardment inside Russia of military targets with these attack of missiles.
[02:01:17.289 --> 02:01:19.550]  Now they're going to start firing the storm shadows as well.
[02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:21.970]  Made in Europe, but owned by the U.S. and England.
[02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:31.010]  We're good to go.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:02:03.399]  And we have to elevate this discussion, understand the pieces here, and make this the top-trending story, as General Flynn said, first hour, and to let Russia know there's a mandate for peace, and to immediately, as President Trump has said, call for a ceasefire and do not give the neocons the escalation they need.
[02:02:03.399 --> 02:02:04.720]  I know that NATO started this.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.920]  I know the West did it.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:13.420]  But Putin, at this point, has defeated NATO on the ground with a special military operation, taken the ground he said he would.
[02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:19.569]  And I understand they don't want to have a pause to let NATO reinforce, but Trump is in in 62 days.
[02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:27.170]  I believe in detente, the smartest move here is for Russia to call for a ceasefire.
[02:02:27.529 --> 02:02:31.470]  Now, I understand the Russians don't behave like that in history when they get attacked.
[02:02:31.789 --> 02:02:34.909]  It's the graveyard of the Nazis and Napoleon and the rest of it.
[02:02:35.449 --> 02:02:36.890]  But here we are.
[02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:38.670]  So, Dr.
[02:02:39.029 --> 02:02:39.689]  Francis Boyle...
[02:02:42.659 --> 02:02:55.619]  We're good to go.
[02:03:00.819 --> 02:03:05.260]  In January of 2020 before anybody else did, so he knows what he's talking about.
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:09.560]  He's also an author of many books dealing with geopolitical systems and war crimes.
[02:03:09.779 --> 02:03:16.300]  And he has authored impeachment that I know, because we've sent it there already in the last few hours, it's being circulated on Capitol Hill.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:18.960]  We are posting that on X right now.
[02:03:19.159 --> 02:03:22.939]  But a former top UN war crimes prosecutor, Dr.
[02:03:23.039 --> 02:03:28.560]  Francis Boyle, has authored articles of impeachment for...
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:36.760]  Joe Biden for his attempt to trigger World War III and nuclear conflagration.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.699]  The fuse is lit.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.520]  We're going to post this.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:41.000]  Articles on X in the next 60 seconds.
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:44.239]  Go to Rel Alex Jones and share it like your future depends on it because it does.
[02:03:44.399 --> 02:03:45.420]  All right, that's a long intro.
[02:03:46.079 --> 02:03:46.319]  Dr.
[02:03:46.439 --> 02:03:48.600]  Boyle, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:03:49.119 --> 02:03:53.600]  Please start wherever you think, either at point-blank range or 35,000-foot view.
[02:03:54.039 --> 02:03:59.159]  And why this is so dangerous and why you're saying Biden needs to be removed, obviously, immediately.
[02:03:59.159 --> 02:04:00.260]  And then I agree with that.
[02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:01.600]  But then what do we do about Harris?
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:03.399]  Because we know they're not really running things.
[02:04:03.539 --> 02:04:09.079]  I guess that would be the message, though, to repudiate her, to know if he is removed, if she tries the same thing, she will be removed.
[02:04:09.199 --> 02:04:14.520]  Explain this to us and what we need to do politically with our voices after you explain what's happening.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:14.979]  Dr.
[02:04:15.079 --> 02:04:15.279]  Boyle.
[02:04:16.399 --> 02:04:18.979]  Well, thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:33.460]  And I wanted to start with the fact that your viewing audience has to know that during almost four years you have had me on to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and the frankenshots.
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:51.770]  I've received several communications from people thanking me for the advice I gave Courtesy of you in Infowars that they believe saved the lives, literally saved the lives of either themselves or their loved ones.
[02:04:51.909 --> 02:05:07.430]  And I think all that credit goes to you for letting me get that message out when I was denied any access to the mainstream news media, despite my impeccable credentials when it came to biological warfare.
[02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:22.109]  That being said, yes, I have drafted a bill of impeachment against President Biden to try to head off a World War III campaign.
[02:05:22.369 --> 02:05:39.210]  Between the United States and Russia, as you know, this new attack with the attackants, technically under the international laws of war, this qualifies as an act of war.
[02:05:39.609 --> 02:05:47.470]  And President Putin would be entitled to treat an act of war by the United States of America.
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:55.760]  And President Putin would be entitled to treat this as an act of war and respond accordingly.
[02:05:56.359 --> 02:06:13.840]  And indeed, as you know, he has already stated that an attack by a non-nuclear state in cooperation with a nuclear state such as the United States would make both states cold belligerents against Russia.
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:16.899]  So the predicate is set there.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:32.340]  I think we're good to go.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:59.399]  That he has spoken about, and also Vice President Vance has spoken about, and that they both truly want to set into place, which I believe they can do.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:06.539]  And what they have done now is significantly ratchet it up, make it more dangerous.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:26.789]  And in my opinion, the Bidenites would like to get us into a Shooting war with Russia so that they could hand that over to President Trump and make it extremely difficult for him to pursue a peaceful resolution over Ukraine.
[02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:40.869]  If and when members of the United States Armed Forces start returning in body bags, it will be very difficult, even I assume President Trump wants to, to negotiate peace with Russia.
[02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:46.069]  This is what, in my opinion, faces us in the next 60 days.
[02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:52.550]  And if this latest attack doesn't do it, the Bidenites will escalate.
[02:07:52.729 --> 02:08:07.489]  So my motivation behind drafting these three articles of impeachment Is to get a member of the House to introduce them immediately into the House of Representatives.
[02:08:07.829 --> 02:08:11.369]  This could be done orally by any member getting up there and reading.
[02:08:11.609 --> 02:08:14.569]  The Republicans are in control of the House.
[02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:16.970]  They can call an immediate vote.
[02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:20.729]  They could have Biden impeached by the end of the week.
[02:08:20.970 --> 02:08:27.250]  And that bill of impeachment, the indictment, would then be shipped to the Senate for a trial.
[02:08:27.619 --> 02:08:33.560]  In my opinion, doing that would discombobulate the Biden administration.
[02:08:33.699 --> 02:08:48.279]  They'd be dead in the water, hopefully dealing with this impeachment effort and buying us time necessary to get to the inauguration on January 20th.
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:51.840]  That's my strategy as I see it.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:58.340]  Doctor, looking at the complete desperation of the deep state, this was an easy thing to predict.
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:04.539]  I did predict they would go to full war with Russia during the time that they were lame duck and President Trump was president-elect.
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.140]  What do you think Trump should be doing with this bully pulpit?
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:09.479]  I believe he should be doing press conferences about this.
[02:09:09.659 --> 02:09:12.279]  I believe he should be calling for the immediate impeachment.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.239]  We saw previous statements of Trump calling for a ceasefire and this would lead to nuclear war and don't deliver the missiles.
[02:09:18.739 --> 02:09:20.100]  He has been silent.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.300]  His son has not been.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:23.699]  I'm really concerned.
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:26.420]  I mean, minutes are days and weeks right now.
[02:09:26.659 --> 02:09:29.159]  The fuse for nuclear war has been lit.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:32.020]  As you said, they're going to keep these provocations going.
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:39.880]  We now know from the Washington Post that two months ago when Biden said that he had given approval, but quote, according to the British government, Didn't want us to get the blame.
[02:09:40.039 --> 02:09:42.319]  Well, now he's done it openly.
[02:09:43.399 --> 02:09:45.020]  Obviously, you know, he didn't make that decision.
[02:09:45.199 --> 02:09:49.680]  But previously, the Washington Post said that his advisors, all of the military advisors said, don't do it.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:51.520]  So who is he listening to?
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:57.319]  Or by studying these people who I know you trained with and worked with, that's why you're so good at exposing them.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:00.739]  Who do you think is actually in charge of this right now?
[02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:06.989]  Well, I have gotten my draft bill of impeachment to the Trump transition team.
[02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:23.550]  So I would hope, with the recommendation that they take it up with President Trump, that he endorse this, and that he contact the Republican leadership of the House, get it on the floor right away, get Biden impeached right away,
[02:10:23.970 --> 02:10:30.670]  ship it off to the Senate for the trial and discombobulate this administration, make them dead in the water.
[02:10:30.859 --> 02:10:47.159]  So I've done the best I can do myself, but I would certainly encourage your listening audience to contact President Trump and also to contact the members of the Republican House Freedom Caucus.
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:50.539]  Several of them do have my bill of impeachment.
[02:10:50.819 --> 02:10:56.859]  I'll be standing by here to advise them if they want further advice from me.
[02:10:57.199 --> 02:11:00.439]  But I've already spoken to one of them.
[02:11:00.539 --> 02:11:02.119]  I won't mention him here.
[02:11:02.659 --> 02:11:07.279]  For 20 minutes over this, I went through the whole thing in great detail.
[02:11:07.479 --> 02:11:11.560]  He agreed with me completely on the merits alone.
[02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:26.489]  So at the time I spoke, I take it the Republican leadership concluded that they could beat Biden fair and square in an election, and so they didn't pursue my impeachment resolution at that time.
[02:11:26.649 --> 02:11:27.829]  But things have changed.
[02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:41.729]  The Bidenites could do everything between now and January 20th to get us into an outright shooting war with Russia that would make it very difficult for President Trump to get us out of it.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:50.000]  I'm not saying it would be impossible, but it would make it immeasurably difficult for President Trump to stop an ongoing war with Russia.
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:51.819]  What do you think Putin should do?
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:12:06.890]  Well, despite your suggestion that Putin I don't think that's what he's going to do.
[02:12:07.210 --> 02:12:21.569]  I think so far, President Putin's response to the NATO full-fledged press against him He has been responsible and measured.
[02:12:21.869 --> 02:12:27.250]  He is not very rational in his approach.
[02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:38.090]  But they will continue this offensive that they are launching in Ukraine, as he said, until they accomplish their objectives.
[02:12:38.569 --> 02:12:50.409]  So I would hope the reports are President Trump has encouraged Putin to engage in a ceasefire, but in all honesty, I don't think he's going to do that.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:13:00.859]  Well, we have more senators coming out, like Senator Josh Hawley, and I'm told Rand Paul's now come out saying this is reckless and insane, and Biden's insane.
[02:13:01.119 --> 02:13:05.619]  What's insane is letting this cabal use him as the puppet.
[02:13:06.159 --> 02:13:10.359]  General Flynn said we need to see major political pressure on Blinken and others.
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:11.180]  Let's go back to that.
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:20.899]  You know the players, and clearly it's the CIA, it's It's the State Department, it's Victoria Newland, and these neocons that are in control of the Democrat Deep State's foreign policy.
[02:13:21.119 --> 02:13:24.300]  Can you speak to who is in charge of this from your deep research?
[02:13:26.329 --> 02:13:31.710]  Well, Joe Biden is non-compass menace, as we lawyers would say.
[02:13:31.909 --> 02:13:34.010]  But it does seem to me right.
[02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:46.010]  We're talking about the power ministries, what the Soviet Union used to call the power ministries, CIA, DOD, Department of State.
[02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:48.069]  That's Blinken, Sullivan.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:55.979]  And then also over in Congress, you have Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Pelosi.
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.220]  These are the people calling the shots.
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:06.779]  And it's very clear that the Democrats are just diehard neocon warmongers against Russia.
[02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:11.869]  This goes all the way back to when they nominated Mrs.
[02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:25.189]  Clinton to be their presidential candidate, and her strategy right from the get-go was to call for war against Russia, comparing Putin to Hitler.
[02:14:25.449 --> 02:14:28.029]  It's just an insult to history.
[02:14:28.569 --> 02:14:31.409]  And that's been their strategy ever since then.
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:35.340]  Dr.
[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:40.100]  Boyle, just in general, you've got a lot of data on this.
[02:14:40.619 --> 02:14:42.479]  What would you impart to the viewers?
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:50.819]  I think you have to contact your members of the House of Representatives immediately and tell them to put it.
[02:14:53.259 --> 02:14:59.380]  I drafted it in such a way that it does not require any hearings at all.
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.159]  The law is set forth quite clearly.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.340]  The facts are all there.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:10.800]  The situation is now more dangerous, existentially dangerous from when I drafted it.
[02:15:10.939 --> 02:15:13.760]  So again, you want that put down.
[02:15:13.989 --> 02:15:16.890]  Into the House of Representatives immediately.
[02:15:17.949 --> 02:15:25.350]  And under the rules of the House, any member can get up and read it orally, introduce it into the House.
[02:15:25.569 --> 02:15:29.390]  The Republican leadership then calls for an immediate vote.
[02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:32.050]  The Republicans control the House.
[02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:34.350]  They can have Biden impeached by the end of the week.
[02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.729]  Sure.
[02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:44.109]  Other facets to this, you know, you trained with the neocons.
[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.229]  People that don't know that special PhD, they do one of a year at Harvard.
[02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:54.850]  You didn't ever work for them, but you got that special degree where they explain how the New World Order globalist system works.
[02:15:55.289 --> 02:15:59.229]  Getting into their thinking, how do they think they're going to get away with starting a nuclear war?
[02:15:59.710 --> 02:16:02.529]  What type of Straussian madmen are we dealing with here?
[02:16:02.609 --> 02:16:05.630]  And how do we counter them, knowing their psychology?
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:12.939]  Well, again, this is still the Brzezinski strategy set forth in the Grand Chessboard.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:30.520]  Remember, Brzezinski has been the foreign policy guru of the entire Democratic Party since he was chair of the Trilateral Commission for David Rockefeller and they co-opted a peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:36.940]  Thank you.
[02:16:50.239 --> 02:16:56.399]  And then in order to exploit its vast natural resources.
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:17:04.120]  So it's still the Brzezinski policy here that is at work with the Democratic Party, all of them.
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:05.760]  What can I say?
[02:17:08.579 --> 02:17:09.420]  You've...
[02:17:10.479 --> 02:17:12.739]  I've been a top UN war crimes prosecutor.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:17.260]  Obviously, the UN's globalist captured entity at this point completely.
[02:17:17.459 --> 02:17:26.879]  But from the war crimes perspective, this is a known proxy war in Ukraine that the West obviously started.
[02:17:27.059 --> 02:17:34.819]  But regardless, what if Russia started bombing targets in the U.S. saying, you're supplying arms, so we're going to hit you there?
[02:17:34.819 --> 02:17:37.139]  It's the same argument against Russia.
[02:17:37.319 --> 02:17:45.479]  I mean, for people that don't know, the Pillars of international law and the rules of war and what's kept us from having a nuclear war so far.
[02:17:45.739 --> 02:17:57.040]  Can you explain to people what a major escalation, really unprecedented history in my somewhat research view, how big a departure this is and how big an escalation this is?
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:00.059]  I mean, just in general rules of war, can you explain that to people?
[02:18:00.799 --> 02:18:01.079]  Right.
[02:18:01.219 --> 02:18:10.879]  Well, let's take Foreign Minister Lavrov, who's probably the best Foreign Minister in the world these days in terms of his experience and analysis.
[02:18:11.479 --> 02:18:19.040]  Early on, he said there was a de facto war between the United States and NATO and Russia.
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:27.399]  Well, now we have de jure acts of warfare directly by the United States government against Russia.
[02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:34.319]  In theory, if they wanted to, Russia now could declare war against the United States.
[02:18:34.579 --> 02:18:37.059]  I don't believe they are going to do that.
[02:18:37.219 --> 02:18:39.899]  That would be a very rash step.
[02:18:40.139 --> 02:18:47.459]  I also do not believe that President Putin would be anytime soon attacking the United States.
[02:18:47.459 --> 02:18:53.520]  I believe his response will be, so far, limited to Ukraine.
[02:18:53.799 --> 02:19:03.020]  But if the Bidenites cannot provoke him, they will move up the scale of escalation.
[02:19:03.170 --> 02:19:20.389]  See if he will attack directly a NATO member state, trigger Article 5 of the NATO pact, and then basically that would be the predicate for war between the United States and NATO against Russia.
[02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:29.690]  Why do you—I'm going to go back to this question because you know their sociopathy or their mindset.
[02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:33.469]  Why would the neocon globalists think they could get away with this?
[02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:38.610]  Well, Alex, they're going for broke.
[02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:42.430]  I mean, that's what the situation is here.
[02:19:42.549 --> 02:20:03.850]  They think that Russia will— Cave in at the end of the day, that if we've discussed this before on escalation dominance and that ladder of escalation, they believe that they will continue moving up the ladder of escalation.
[02:20:03.989 --> 02:20:07.409]  Herman Kahn, you remember, we discussed this maybe a year ago.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:17.379]  And then if they keep moving up that letter of escalation, eventually Russia will either back down or they will crack.
[02:20:17.379 --> 02:20:21.620]  You had that mutiny already against Putin.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:30.639]  So that is their calculation, that they can establish escalation dominance over Russia and get their way.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:38.399]  The president, of course, that was, as you mentioned, the Cuban Missile Crisis, what Thomas Schelling called compelling.
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:56.520]  Their conclusion, Schelling, head of me at Harvard in the government department, Schelling's analysis, which was, I think, incorrect, What forced Russia to back down was that every stage of a ladder of escalation,
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:03.420]  the United States had dominance up to and including strategic nuclear weapons.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:18.110]  And therefore, the Kennedy administration was able to compel the Soviets to throw in the towel during the Cuban Missile Crisis and And withdraw those missiles.
[02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:20.250]  It's the same logic here.
[02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:31.290]  They keep moving up the cons ladder of escalation, figuring that at some point Russia will back down or it will crack up internally.
[02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:40.670]  And instead, it's made Russia stronger, driven, all the Brexit nations together, and the neocons just keep doubling down.
[02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:42.530]  You're right.
[02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:45.069]  When they're wrong, they keep doubling down.
[02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:46.770]  That's their mentality.
[02:21:47.709 --> 02:21:49.790]  I don't know what to say about it.
[02:21:49.889 --> 02:21:54.250]  Any objective study of history would agree with President Trump.
[02:21:54.370 --> 02:22:01.610]  And by the way, I know he just made a very compelling statement, I think yesterday, about the dangers of World War III here.
[02:22:01.729 --> 02:22:03.350]  I just watched that statement.
[02:22:03.549 --> 02:22:04.409]  It's very powerful.
[02:22:04.909 --> 02:22:07.469]  But he didn't call for the impeachment of Biden.
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:16.639]  I think the time has come, with all due respect to President Trump, given the severity of the situation, he has to make a public appeal here.
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:25.520]  He had 70 million votes there, that Biden has to be impeached immediately, and these people completely discombobulated.
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:33.159]  That's right, we're gonna get that statement played again after you leave us, but let's come back and talk about the threat escalation ladder and where we are, and also an update on the COVID bio-attack.
[02:22:33.319 --> 02:22:33.420]  Dr.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:34.459]  Francis Boyle, stay with us.
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:43.500]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health.
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:49.299]  Not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.239]  It's just all around us.
[02:22:50.659 --> 02:22:53.579]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[02:22:53.719 --> 02:22:54.180]  Bill Gates.
[02:22:54.860 --> 02:23:02.479]  Is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:03.280]  It's insane.
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:09.700]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[02:23:09.959 --> 02:23:20.500]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:23.829]  Now, These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[02:23:24.069 --> 02:23:26.709]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:30.930]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:32.909]  This is amazing.
[02:23:32.909 --> 02:23:34.290]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:41.829]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[02:23:42.629 --> 02:23:54.430]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[02:23:54.610 --> 02:24:00.920]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is Insane.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:01.340]  Look it up.
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:03.840]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[02:24:04.139 --> 02:24:06.059]  It's got the trifecta going.
[02:24:06.319 --> 02:24:27.219]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, and you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:35.280]  Alright, Dr.
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:37.840]  Francis Boyle is our guest.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:40.059]  And he talks a lot about...
[02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:47.190]  The threat escalation ladder developed back decades and decades ago, back in the 50s and 60s, and then it's been updated.
[02:24:47.350 --> 02:24:50.569]  Most governments follow similar threat escalation ladders.
[02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:53.149]  This has all been war-gamed to the 10th degree.
[02:24:54.290 --> 02:25:02.190]  And that's why Biden said two years ago, we can't give F-16s and Abrams tanks, that's World War III, because that goes up the threat escalation ladder.
[02:25:02.229 --> 02:25:03.309]  And we'll get to that with Dr.
[02:25:03.430 --> 02:25:03.989]  Boyle here in a moment.
[02:25:04.069 --> 02:25:06.469]  But first, new story up on Infowars.com.
[02:25:07.239 --> 02:25:12.319]  Russia, using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, would collapse global economy, warns declassified intel document.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:23.000]  Declassified memorandum of the National Intelligence Council also notes that Russia deploying a nuke would send the dollar soaring and attract global investments into the U.S. for a safe haven.
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:31.100]  And there's leaked U.N. video of the peacekeeper manager saying, we want a big war, that'll make us money.
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.540]  Well, the money will be worthless if you're radiated and dead.
[02:25:34.350 --> 02:25:37.270]  Putin's spokesman warns the West is in the worst scenario.
[02:25:37.450 --> 02:25:42.389]  The nuclear war happens before Christmas of this year in response to Ukraine's missile strike on Russia.
[02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:44.809]  So, total insanity.
[02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:48.229]  And we have former top UN war crimes prosecutor, Dr.
[02:25:48.530 --> 02:26:03.079]  Francis Boyle, We have Senator Howley saying Biden needs to be removed.
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:03.840]  It's totally insane.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.420]  We have Congressman Massey and many others coming out saying that as well.
[02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:14.010]  Also, we have just other insane things happening.
[02:26:15.069 --> 02:26:15.270]  So Dr.
[02:26:15.329 --> 02:26:19.469]  Boyle, spend a few minutes for us on why the threat escalation ladder is so important.
[02:26:19.909 --> 02:26:24.270]  And maybe we can start down here at number one and then briefly go through it.
[02:26:24.350 --> 02:26:27.030]  And where would you say we are on the ladder right now, Doctor?
[02:26:28.569 --> 02:26:33.989]  Well, I think you had somewhere in there a formal declaration of war.
[02:26:34.489 --> 02:26:38.670]  I'm afraid we're close to that right now.
[02:26:39.329 --> 02:26:43.709]  Yeah, we're beyond nuclear ultimatums, shows of force.
[02:26:45.709 --> 02:26:49.530]  Yeah, 20 worldwide embargo, we have that.
[02:26:49.729 --> 02:26:52.270]  Not local nuclear war yet.
[02:26:53.649 --> 02:26:59.209]  But we're at a point now of a formal declaration of war by Russia.
[02:26:59.530 --> 02:27:05.129]  Certainly after the attack, they have legal grounds to do this if they want to.
[02:27:05.350 --> 02:27:10.729]  Well, we said two months ago, if the missiles are delivered, we're at war with NATO and its members.
[02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:13.690]  So I think they're deciding what to announce right now is what you're saying.
[02:27:13.809 --> 02:27:14.190]  That's where we are.
[02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.450]  Right.
[02:27:15.649 --> 02:27:28.290]  And remember, President Putin went to law school, graduated from law school before he joined the KGB. So he has some familiarity here with the gradations we are talking about.
[02:27:28.530 --> 02:27:33.649]  And Lavrov has already mentioned a de facto state of war.
[02:27:33.809 --> 02:27:36.709]  So basically, the ball is in their court.
[02:27:37.779 --> 02:27:42.379]  How responsible are the Russians going to be under these circumstances?
[02:27:42.719 --> 02:27:48.899]  And as you said, we have, going back years, but public statements of Newland and the rest, they believe Russia's going to keep backing down.
[02:27:49.059 --> 02:27:58.059]  But Putin said when he invaded in a counter-response, counter-offensive, two and a half, almost three years ago, he said, take us serious now.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:27:59.479]  We're not backing down now.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:01.700]  He said, our retreat is over.
[02:28:01.879 --> 02:28:02.719]  Can you speak to that?
[02:28:04.399 --> 02:28:10.819]  Well yes, this notion that Putin is bluffing, he was head of the KGB, those people do not bluff.
[02:28:11.239 --> 02:28:21.409]  And he's a pretty tough character, but he has, in my opinion, throughout this entire Matter acted very responsibly.
[02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:47.799]  Before the war started, they sent two treaties over to the Biden administration and to NATO, setting forth the parameters of a peaceful, negotiated way out of the very serious security threat that was Presented to them and the Russian speakers by Ukraine itself and by the NATO states.
[02:28:47.979 --> 02:28:49.860]  I read those two treaties.
[02:28:50.079 --> 02:28:52.540]  They were eminently negotiable.
[02:28:52.739 --> 02:29:00.079]  And yet the Biden administration adamantly refused to negotiate with them over anything at all.
[02:29:00.219 --> 02:29:26.250]  And as Foreign Minister Lavrov said at the time about the two treaties, The bottom line is we have to have an absolute guaranteed commitment that Ukraine does not join NATO. Now, this is a perfectly reasonable position to take because when the negotiations took place on the reunification of the city of Berlin,
[02:29:27.209 --> 02:29:42.389]  The U.S. Secretary of State at that time under George Bush Sr., Jim Baker, gave a commitment to Gorbachev that if he agreed to the reunification of Berlin, the NATO would not move,
[02:29:42.590 --> 02:29:45.909]  quote, one inch, close quote, to the east.
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:51.399]  And several other leaders of NATO states made that exact same commitment.
[02:29:51.659 --> 02:30:04.020]  Under international law, the oral commitments made by high-level government officials acting within the scope of their authority are binding.
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:05.780]  The Russians know this.
[02:30:06.879 --> 02:30:11.180]  I've lectured over there to their international lawyers and law professors.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:13.719]  And yet, what happened?
[02:30:14.059 --> 02:30:14.840]  Bush Sr.
[02:30:15.079 --> 02:30:16.200]  honored that commitment.
[02:30:16.739 --> 02:30:26.180]  Clinton came in and immediately proceeded to violate it, brought NATO far to the east, And then Bush Jr.
[02:30:26.420 --> 02:30:37.000]  got up there and said, well, we're going to incorporate Ukraine and Georgia, and then precipitated the Georgian attack on South Ossetia.
[02:30:37.299 --> 02:30:50.319]  So this commitment that NATO, that Ukraine not join NATO, which is their bottom line from the get-go here, we've already promised that to them.
[02:30:50.379 --> 02:30:52.079]  So what is the problem here?
[02:30:52.250 --> 02:31:09.610]  The problem is, certainly the Biden administration and before that, the Obama administration, under the influence of Brzezinski, were not interested in a peaceful resolution of this security matter with Russia.
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:14.260]  Dr.
[02:31:14.399 --> 02:31:20.559]  Boyle, while we have you here, can you just, in a snapshot, and then any other closing comments you'd like to make, I'm very gracious with your time.
[02:31:21.379 --> 02:31:22.159]  Can you...
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:31.479]  Give us your snapshot on where the different power blocks are, where the neocon Anglo-American establishment globalists are.
[02:31:32.159 --> 02:31:35.239]  In my view, the Ponzi scheme, the global bubble is coming to an end.
[02:31:35.559 --> 02:31:39.000]  The world, because of their bullying tactics, is pulling away from them.
[02:31:39.139 --> 02:31:39.840]  They're losing power.
[02:31:40.899 --> 02:31:45.399]  Populists, whether they be left or right, anti-globalists are being elected everywhere around the world.
[02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:47.700]  Their power is retreating.
[02:31:48.159 --> 02:31:52.440]  They had tried to make a deal with China to sell out America and have some new global order.
[02:31:52.559 --> 02:31:57.940]  China broke with them, as you know, in the last 12 years and is now deeply allied with Russia.
[02:31:58.700 --> 02:32:02.500]  North Korean troops are now in on the border with Ukraine, probably in there.
[02:32:02.739 --> 02:32:07.180]  They're now saying it looks like Chinese ships were probably what cut the cables of the Baltic Sea.
[02:32:08.559 --> 02:32:10.780]  This declaration of war we haven't heard yet.
[02:32:10.899 --> 02:32:14.379]  It appears to me already not just a burning fuse, but...
[02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:17.469]  It seems to be detonating right now.
[02:32:17.629 --> 02:32:20.370]  It would be very hard to put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:28.049]  So I guess my question here is, back to my first one, to elaborate more, to understand these crazies.
[02:32:29.010 --> 02:32:30.530]  Their power is coming to an end.
[02:32:30.649 --> 02:32:33.010]  They're putting this political military gun to our head.
[02:32:34.809 --> 02:32:37.329]  Do you agree with my statement or can you expand on it?
[02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:43.030]  I look at things geopolitically, economically, culturally, historically.
[02:32:43.250 --> 02:32:44.670]  I do think this is a fourth turning.
[02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:51.670]  If I was them, I would maintain their wealth and power and just lay low and still try to exert a lot of influence.
[02:32:51.850 --> 02:32:57.530]  This desperate Barbarosian, Hitlerian power grab against Russia...
[02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:11.280]  This Napoleonic action just is repeating history and just smells of death and destruction and total failure and is the exact last move I would make, even putting myself in their rotting satanic brains.
[02:33:11.459 --> 02:33:12.379]  Can you speak to that?
[02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:16.040]  Well, Alex, you have to understand...
[02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:23.569]  From my perspective and your perspective, these people look objectively insane, but not from their perspective.
[02:33:23.770 --> 02:33:33.389]  Remember, I went through the exact same programs with them at the University of Chicago, the home of the neocons for three years, and then at Harvard for seven years.
[02:33:33.530 --> 02:33:44.239]  This is the way we indoctrinate our elite When it comes to foreign affairs and defense and things of this nature.
[02:33:44.559 --> 02:33:48.920]  So from their perspective, it makes perfect sense what they are doing.
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:34:03.989]  This is what my teacher, mentor, and friend, the late, great Hans Morgenthau called unlimited imperialism to distinguish it from traditional imperialism.
[02:34:04.129 --> 02:34:15.370]  Morgenthau was the founder of international political science and the founder of the Realist School of International Political Science right after the Second World War.
[02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:23.290]  And if you read his work, he identifies what he calls unlimited imperialism.
[02:34:23.559 --> 02:34:35.719]  Along the lines of Alexander the Great, the Romans, the Arabs at their zenith, Napoleon and Hitler.
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:41.399]  And this is the type of people we have running the government.
[02:34:41.459 --> 02:34:50.219]  You're talking about manifest destiny on a global scale, but not promoting Americana, promoting corporatist insanity.
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:57.479]  Well, again, I'm trying to explain to you, Alex, I mean, we could look at the Nazis and say they were insane.
[02:34:57.860 --> 02:35:10.920]  But if you study the rise of the Nazis, which I had to do to get that PhD at Harvard, they made perfect sense to large numbers of Germans over there and collaborators in other countries.
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:16.059]  So I don't know how far it gets us to say these people are insane.
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:20.879]  We have to understand them, what motivates them, and what their objectives are.
[02:35:21.239 --> 02:35:38.899]  But as Morgenthau said, these unlimited imperialists will try to conquer and dominate the entire world unless and until some group of men and women stand up and oppose them.
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.340]  And that is exactly what Russia is doing today.
[02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:51.680]  I was about to say, historically, why is it Russia that is the battleground of this?
[02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:53.559]  I mean, this is happening again.
[02:35:54.299 --> 02:36:00.139]  Right, because of the pivotal location of Russia there in Eurasia.
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:05.139]  Russia has the largest landmass in the world.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:09.379]  It has incredible natural resources there.
[02:36:09.559 --> 02:36:16.569]  It is the key No, to control and dominate Eurasia.
[02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:26.170]  And as Brzezinski pointed out in Grand Chessboard, following McKinder, whoever controls Eurasia controls the world.
[02:36:26.329 --> 02:36:30.090]  And that's what these neoconservatives want to do.
[02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:32.420]  Dr.
[02:36:32.579 --> 02:36:40.879]  Boyle, again, former top UN war crimes prosecutor, very respected scholar, lawyer, author of many, many, many books.
[02:36:42.879 --> 02:36:49.280]  We are just at a historic moment that is hard to describe how existentially dangerous and just...
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:59.299]  Just unfathomably, just megalomaniacal, and it is where we are.
[02:36:59.459 --> 02:37:01.440]  I don't know how we telegraph the urgency.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:09.059]  In all your years, in law and geopolitics and around the world, you have people that don't know about you.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.200]  It's a very long history and a lot of amazing events you've been part of.
[02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:16.139]  A lot of governments you represented, you name it, U.S. government, you name it, but foreign governments.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:17.940]  How would you...
[02:37:19.079 --> 02:37:23.020]  Is this the most dangerous time in history, in your view?
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:24.000]  Because that's what I think.
[02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:31.719]  Well, Alex, I did live through the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it was pretty scary at that time.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:37.440]  Obviously, at that time, we believe we could have been blown up at any time.
[02:37:37.799 --> 02:37:39.559]  But didn't we have more sane leaders then?
[02:37:39.559 --> 02:37:40.520]  That's why I think this is more dangerous.
[02:37:43.159 --> 02:37:59.559]  I think you're right about that, that President Kennedy, I'm a political independent, I'm just trying to be objective about it, but President Kennedy did volunteer for combat in World War II against Imperial Japan that had attacked us at Pearl Harbor,
[02:37:59.739 --> 02:38:02.239]  and he was engaged in combat.
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:05.459]  He was seriously wounded in combat.
[02:38:07.639 --> 02:38:10.459]  He was run over by a battleship fighting it.
[02:38:11.170 --> 02:38:11.889]  That is correct.
[02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:22.229]  And so he had some idea, at least a comprehension, based on his personal experience of what war was all about.
[02:38:22.729 --> 02:38:24.870]  None of these neocons have been to war.
[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:29.250]  Most of them that I'm aware of, they're all what we would call chicken hogs.
[02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:31.729]  I didn't support the Vietnam War.
[02:38:31.889 --> 02:38:32.389]  Fine.
[02:38:32.729 --> 02:38:36.920]  And if they didn't want to support the Vietnam War, That's fine, too.
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:40.059]  But here, a generation later, they're all warmongers.
[02:38:40.139 --> 02:38:51.120]  And they're happy to send the young men and young women, the children of America, who are not these neocon elites, off to fight and die.
[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:54.979]  It's no skin off of their nose because their kids aren't going to be doing it.
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:59.219]  They're all busy trying to get their kids into the elite.
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:38:59.879]  That's right.
[02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:05.020]  They are disconnected from the reality Of what they're doing.
[02:39:05.319 --> 02:39:16.959]  I mean, you look at Victoria Newland, she couldn't find her ass with both hands, and she just deliciously talks about war and how beautiful it is, and we're killing Russians, and it's beyond sickening.
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:24.120]  To get back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, though, Alex, if you study it, it was a very close thing.
[02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:35.659]  In the executive committee that President Kennedy convened, the majority of them wanted to attack Cuba, to invade Cuba.
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:44.760]  And those Russian troops, the Soviet troops, were already armed with tactical nuclear weapons with instructions to use them if there was an invasion.
[02:39:45.079 --> 02:39:53.139]  The key people opposing an invasion were my friend George Ball, Under Secretary of State.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:40:06.520]  Adlai Stevenson, the UN ambassador there from the state of Illinois, Bobby Kennedy, the president's brother, and the president himself.
[02:40:06.819 --> 02:40:09.100]  So it was a very close thing there.
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:18.100]  We could have had a third world war right then and there in the Cuban Missile Crisis with 10 or 12 days.
[02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:23.000]  Well, at least we have time, 60 days now, to head this off.
[02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:26.860]  So that's the time frame here we're working with.
[02:40:29.479 --> 02:40:30.180]  All right, Dr.
[02:40:30.319 --> 02:40:32.579]  Boyle, people can just search your name, Dr.
[02:40:32.659 --> 02:40:37.659]  Francis Boyle, find all the amazing, incredibly informative, thought-provoking books you've written and articles you've written.
[02:40:37.719 --> 02:40:44.040]  Your articles on impeachment are the most important, obviously, anything you've ever written, trying to stop World War III. We need to flood Congress with this.
[02:40:44.239 --> 02:40:48.420]  I posted it on ExitRealAlexJones, and we posted it on Infowars.com.
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:51.520]  Now it's up to the people to protect themselves and all of our futures collectively.
[02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:52.659]  Dr.
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:54.780]  Boyle, 60-second closing comment.
[02:40:56.450 --> 02:41:08.030]  Well, the other thing I wanted to point out here is this creation of a worldwide totalitarian police state by the World Health Organization.
[02:41:09.090 --> 02:41:11.209]  I've been working on that for quite some time.
[02:41:11.370 --> 02:41:12.809]  I think I've discussed it with you.
[02:41:12.809 --> 02:41:12.969]  Well, let's stop.
[02:41:13.090 --> 02:41:13.989]  We've got more time then.
[02:41:14.049 --> 02:41:17.010]  I know you need to leave here, but let's go ahead and bring that up.
[02:41:17.069 --> 02:41:18.489]  That was next, but I didn't want to go there.
[02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:24.290]  Let's talk about that because you authored our biological weapon treaties and more.
[02:41:24.409 --> 02:41:28.850]  You're a former top UN officer as well or individual.
[02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:33.110]  So yeah, let's talk about the UN global treaty and who's behind that.
[02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.909]  Go ahead and give us an update.
[02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:35.049]  Right.
[02:41:35.270 --> 02:41:58.489]  Well, right now today, the World Health Organization is attempting to negotiate A totalitarian pandemic treaty that would completely destroy the sovereignty of the United States of America and give it over into the hands of the globalists who control the World Health Organization.
[02:41:58.489 --> 02:42:08.450]  That would be Bill Gates, the Chinese Communist dictatorship, the big pharma and the biowarfare industry.
[02:42:09.010 --> 02:42:15.110]  We're good to go.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:55.920]  When it comes to our basic health care here in the United States of America, they will be able to issue orders all the way from Geneva down to your primary care physician, which we've already seen during the COVID pandemic.
[02:42:56.139 --> 02:43:07.079]  Now, President Trump can pull us out Of the World Health Organization immediately after his inauguration.
[02:43:07.299 --> 02:43:17.600]  I have drawn up an instrument for President Trump to sign to pull us out of the WHO on January 20th.
[02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:22.549]  Thank you.
[02:43:23.010 --> 02:43:28.190]  Thank you.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.059]  And say, file Professor Boyle's instrument of withdrawal.
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:47.659]  First thing you do when you get back to the Resolute Dex after the inauguration, pull us out and let the World Health Organization rot on the vine.
[02:43:47.979 --> 02:43:49.879]  We can't have these people.
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:44:02.379]  And if you look at it, when the COVID-19 pandemic We're good to go.
[02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:08.549]  And a cooperating institution.
[02:44:08.829 --> 02:44:13.469]  And you said that, and you were the first to say that, and it all came out that they were involved covering the whole thing up.
[02:44:13.770 --> 02:44:15.129]  They need a trigger for it.
[02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:17.350]  They've already tried monkeypox, and they call it mpox.
[02:44:17.989 --> 02:44:21.149]  Then they tried bird flu, and now, disaster waiting to happen.
[02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:26.110]  FDA approves phase one trials of Gates-funded self-amplifying bird flu vaccine.
[02:44:26.149 --> 02:44:28.930]  That means it spreads a live vaccine.
[02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:30.950]  This could be the trigger right here.
[02:44:31.090 --> 02:44:32.190]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:36.329]  I'm really concerned they'll launch a new bio-attack before Trump takes office, or once he's in.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:39.379]  Yes, they could do this.
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:40.739]  There's no question about it.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:50.319]  You remember the whole mishandling of COVID and what happened there, the impact it had on the 2020 election.
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:52.579]  So yes, they could unleash something.
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:53.819]  They've been preparing this.
[02:44:53.979 --> 02:44:55.420]  There's no question at all.
[02:44:55.559 --> 02:45:11.170]  But the first thing President Trump can do We're good to go.
[02:45:26.649 --> 02:45:32.049]  The Food and Drug Administration was involved in this as well, in developing COVID-19.
[02:45:32.229 --> 02:45:37.389]  Do you find it encouraging that Elon Musk and Kennedy are now putting out reports they're gonna go after Fauci in the deep state?
[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:47.170]  Well, yeah, if you read Bobby Kennedy's books on Fauci and then on the Wuhan cover-up, they're very encouraging.
[02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:59.450]  As a matter of fact, right after Bobby finished the book on Fauci, he called me up and asked me to serve as an advisor to him on the Wuhan cover-up, which I did.
[02:45:59.670 --> 02:46:03.450]  And at his request, I vetted that entire book.
[02:46:04.430 --> 02:46:08.829]  And so I think you can relieve Bobby's book on what happened here on Wuhan.
[02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:14.809]  He has an excellent comprehension of what these death scientists have been all about.
[02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:17.909]  And that's why they're so scared, because their whole regime's in trouble.
[02:46:17.989 --> 02:46:18.110]  Dr.
[02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:19.709]  Boyle, it's been too long.
[02:46:19.930 --> 02:46:20.450]  Thank you.
[02:46:20.610 --> 02:46:22.069]  Please give us an update very, very soon.
[02:46:22.209 --> 02:46:25.290]  Let's all work hard and pray that we don't end up in a nuclear war.
[02:46:25.489 --> 02:46:25.909]  Thank you, Dr.
[02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.229]  Boyle.
[02:46:26.889 --> 02:46:27.469]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:28.450]  Keep up the good work.
[02:46:28.819 --> 02:46:29.219]  I'm trying.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:29.700]  Thank you, sir.
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:31.479]  Alright, we're all in this together.
[02:46:31.719 --> 02:46:34.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't spend time on InfoWars a lot today.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:36.059]  We're under total attack.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.659]  There is an emergency hearing now next Monday.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:42.559]  The deep state got caught in open illegal activity.
[02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:43.719]  I don't say that lightly.
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.159]  It's 100%.
[02:46:45.159 --> 02:46:49.360]  My lawyers all agree, and they filed in lawsuits yesterday and today.
[02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:55.399]  All of that, and it is all online at RealAlexJones and InfoWars.com.
[02:46:55.479 --> 02:46:56.200]  It is incredible.
[02:46:56.959 --> 02:46:58.500]  It shows their total desperation.
[02:46:59.379 --> 02:47:06.739]  And just like when I declared bankruptcy two years ago, it cut our funds by about 40% because listeners thought we were going to go away.
[02:47:06.959 --> 02:47:08.920]  I told you we weren't if you supported us.
[02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:11.450]  Same thing started Friday.
[02:47:12.090 --> 02:47:17.209]  People thought, oh, if we buy anything from Alex Jones, it goes to The Onion, the Democrats, who are saying they bought this.
[02:47:17.350 --> 02:47:17.829]  That's a lie.
[02:47:18.270 --> 02:47:21.950]  Our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, is not owned by them.
[02:47:22.229 --> 02:47:29.389]  It is a sponsor hooked up in the bankruptcy funding InfoWars, but it's also funding the Alex Jones Network and all the systems that we've got.
[02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:36.309]  So people believing the lie that we're gone, look, we're back in the building, it's all BS. You're going to see, the documents are there, all the proof.
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:41.200]  Is a psychological warfare operation.
[02:47:41.319 --> 02:47:41.739]  Overhead shot.
[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:55.079]  That's why on the violence policy center, you know, every town, Democrat party group that runs this and admits they're funding the onion and all this, they say Infowars, a global tetrahedron company.
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:55.780]  No, they're not.
[02:47:55.979 --> 02:47:59.379]  They had our website turned off illegally, seized the building illegally with no court order.
[02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:02.280]  They're in deep crap, period.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.239]  If there's any justice in this country, my lawyers say there's no way this doesn't all get reversed and they'll probably...
[02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:10.309]  Be indicted.
[02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:11.750]  So, that's okay.
[02:48:12.010 --> 02:48:14.930]  So, I mean, they're starting World War III, too.
[02:48:15.469 --> 02:48:17.329]  I mean, it's the same group, folks.
[02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:18.709]  They want us off the air.
[02:48:18.909 --> 02:48:20.489]  So, the lawsuits are all up there.

[02:48:41.250 --> 02:48:42.329]  All right, stay with me.
[02:48:42.450 --> 02:48:43.430]  Tons of news straight ahead.
[02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:48.370]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[02:48:48.670 --> 02:49:00.909]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[02:49:01.129 --> 02:49:02.729]  They are a private agency.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.260]  Some of the president's elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:10.000]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:10.819]  No.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:17.540]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:18.239]  No.
[02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:31.440]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:49:31.659 --> 02:49:38.739]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:54.920]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration It's where the ESGs come from, it's where the global governance comes from,
[02:49:55.139 --> 02:50:00.219]  the corporate social credit scores, all of it, and President Trump is striking right at the end.
[02:50:00.239 --> 02:50:02.959]  The heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:10.319]  Now, in closing here, Infowars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[02:50:10.479 --> 02:50:13.180]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:18.000]  But regardless, backups are being set up, new systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:27.340]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com, with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:34.280]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:44.840]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[02:50:45.079 --> 02:50:45.959]  Here it is on screen.
[02:50:46.559 --> 02:50:47.120]  Iconic.
[02:50:47.319 --> 02:50:57.639]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[02:50:58.409 --> 02:51:09.389]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[02:51:09.690 --> 02:51:19.180]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with Three simple words at the bottom.
[02:51:19.559 --> 02:51:21.239]  Back to back to back.
[02:51:21.459 --> 02:51:22.239]  That's right.
[02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:30.120]  He's the only president to ever run three times, and he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[02:51:30.319 --> 02:51:31.239]  He won in 16.
[02:51:31.239 --> 02:51:38.329]  He won in 2020 and he won in 2024, but this time the landslide was so big they could not stop him.
[02:51:38.549 --> 02:51:40.229]  This is historic.
[02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:41.110]  We've won the battle.
[02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:44.450]  Now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[02:51:44.569 --> 02:51:50.729]  And to do that, he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[02:51:50.850 --> 02:51:56.030]  The most reach we've ever had thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[02:51:56.250 --> 02:52:25.170]  Everybody wants to hear what my Thank you so much.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.020]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, transmitting worldwide.
[02:52:48.639 --> 02:52:58.180]  We are still here at the Infowars Command Center, illegally seized with no court order by a Justice Department official, acting under color of law last Thursday at 8 a.m.
[02:52:58.319 --> 02:53:00.319]  We were back the next day.
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:02.360]  I am here now.
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:07.139]  They have committed major public crimes in their action.
[02:53:11.889 --> 02:53:14.909]  They want us off air because they know I'll have people like Dr.
[02:53:15.350 --> 02:53:21.489]  Francis Boyle on, who's drafted up articles of impeachment before that have been adopted by Congress.
[02:53:22.569 --> 02:53:32.629]  He's drafted up a new one against Joe Biden for trying to start World War III by bombing inside Russia with U.S. missiles, blowing up Russian military bases.
[02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:33.770]  What do you think we'd do?
[02:53:36.129 --> 02:53:38.690]  They don't want us on air like I told you last week.
[02:53:38.690 --> 02:53:40.129]  They're about to start bombing Russia.
[02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:44.829]  I said, they're about to start bombing Russia, and the orders have come down to get me off the air.
[02:53:46.110 --> 02:53:49.530]  We're only reaching 80 to 100 million people a day right now.
[02:53:49.829 --> 02:53:58.190]  The only person now reaching more people in the media is Elon Musk and Donald Trump.
[02:53:59.590 --> 02:54:00.790]  But I won't wait.
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:08.719]  Like Trump's doing, and he should do it soon with new statements, I come out here with the narrative of the truth first.
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:12.360]  We are the trailblazers.
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:14.139]  We are the Paul Revere's.
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:15.159]  We are the tip of the spear.
[02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:20.860]  We are team humanity, God, family, country.
[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:26.180]  I have filed a major lawsuit.
[02:54:27.049 --> 02:54:30.010]  And restraining orders in federal court at 2.30 in the morning today.
[02:54:30.569 --> 02:54:33.909]  I was up until then making sure it was all deadly accurate.
[02:54:34.430 --> 02:54:36.729]  All the documents, how they illegally did it, here.
[02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:43.590]  The good guys that had the winning bid to get Infowars, not the one you heard, have filed their major operations.
[02:54:44.590 --> 02:54:51.350]  All the documents, all the proof, right here, of the bid rigging.
[02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:54.590]  Cut and dry.
[02:54:55.930 --> 02:54:58.290]  They told other bidders you can't use anything but cash.
[02:54:58.850 --> 02:55:01.290]  They didn't let the quote-winning people say it was their credit.
[02:55:02.649 --> 02:55:03.610]  That's just the start.
[02:55:03.829 --> 02:55:04.829]  It wasn't an auction.
[02:55:04.969 --> 02:55:06.469]  The judge didn't authorize that auction.
[02:55:06.590 --> 02:55:08.370]  He said in the future we need hearings about it.
[02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:14.110]  He said I didn't even know there was an auction last Thursday, the emergency hearing, that Elon Musk's lawyers were there joining in defense of Infowars.
[02:55:15.649 --> 02:55:32.049]  And then they tell you The Onion bought it, but then they admit on Good Morning America Friday that it is the Democratic Party And every town that is the new name of the Soros Democrat Party Gun Control Consortium, no longer the Violence Policy Center and the Brady Group.
[02:55:32.989 --> 02:55:33.770]  Say that again.
[02:55:34.629 --> 02:55:46.110]  The Democrat Gun Control Consortium has run this whole PR campaign, used me to raise money saying I didn't mean things to their kids, never did any of that, had show trials produced by HBO where I was already guilty.
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:52.280]  And now they want me off the air and have gone and openly rigged this process.
[02:55:53.020 --> 02:55:56.379]  And when Donald Trump gets in office, they're getting indicted.
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:57.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:58.059 --> 02:55:58.500]  Stay with us.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:03.959]  And here we are again today, ladies and gentlemen, on the verge of thermonuclear war.
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.420]  The fuse has been lit.
[02:56:09.399 --> 02:56:12.639]  Will we make this the big issue or is the NFL more important?
[02:56:13.909 --> 02:56:18.389]  Will we drive this information in the reports with General Flynn live today and Dr.
[02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:35.250]  Francis Boyle, one of the top international experts in the world on nuclear, chemical, biological conflict, former top advisor to the UN, advisors to presidents, or are we just going to sit here and all blow each other up?
[02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:37.610]  This is worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:39.549]  He agreed to that.
[02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:42.270]  That was the worst previous event.
[02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:45.399]  Putin has said that he's at war with the West.
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:50.059]  Massive missiles raining down on Russian military bases far inside Russia.
[02:56:51.579 --> 02:56:53.799]  This is total insanity.
[02:56:55.579 --> 02:56:56.840]  Now, I wanted to get Dr.
[02:56:56.979 --> 02:56:59.920]  Kirk Elliott on to get his take on this.
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:07.479]  He's not just a great economist and not just the top silver slash gold broker in North America because of his top ratings and great prices, and he is a sponsor.
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:10.500]  I want to get him on also as a theologian.
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:11.219]  He has a degree in that.
[02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:16.989]  On the situation spiritually where we are.
[02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:18.569]  We knew the globalists would do this.
[02:57:18.690 --> 02:57:20.469]  I said their main move will be total war with Russia.
[02:57:21.170 --> 02:57:24.350]  That was a placeholder two months ago when Biden said we'll start bombing Russia.
[02:57:25.290 --> 02:57:27.209]  And then Sunday the announcement came out.
[02:57:27.329 --> 02:57:28.030]  He's just a puppet.
[02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:29.909]  He's a placeholder too.
[02:57:31.250 --> 02:57:32.370]  And now it's begun.
[02:57:32.569 --> 02:57:33.409]  This is the big challenge.
[02:57:33.569 --> 02:57:34.209]  This is the big move.
[02:57:34.290 --> 02:57:37.329]  Now they can cyber attack, say the Russians did it, turn the power off.
[02:57:37.450 --> 02:57:38.729]  That's their next move, obviously.
[02:57:39.270 --> 02:57:40.290]  Not saying they're going to do it.
[02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:41.909]  If we expose it, they may back off.
[02:57:42.010 --> 02:57:42.950]  But people better know.
[02:57:43.250 --> 02:57:44.590]  We can go dark any moment.
[02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:48.870]  They want us off before they flip the internet kill switch.
[02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:50.229]  You'll still get internet.
[02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:52.069]  It'll just be government and corporate channels.
[02:57:54.149 --> 02:57:56.450]  Today, tomorrow, next week will be the last time you hear us.
[02:57:57.379 --> 02:58:01.899]  The deep state Democrat groups trying to shut us down beforehand are just pawns.
[02:58:02.659 --> 02:58:16.360]  And I tried to explain that to the crew and everybody else that what's happening to Infowars is the least of everybody's problems, though we need to be kept in the front lines Because it's not just evil that's on the field.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:19.180]  This good is on the field and good has the initiative and good is rising.
[02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:20.639]  We got Trump in.
[02:58:20.719 --> 02:58:21.719]  We overpowered their fraud.
[02:58:22.420 --> 02:58:25.399]  And we keep surviving the Justice Department attempts to shut us down.
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:30.420]  The grand juries, the attacks, the congressional subpoenas, the congressional testimony that they destroyed.
[02:58:30.899 --> 02:58:35.719]  My congressional testimony destroyed the whole January 6th investigation because it was really a way to find out what we knew.
[02:58:36.159 --> 02:58:37.239]  They ran the whole thing.
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:40.479]  And it's not like I'm John Gotti saying I got away with anything.
[02:58:40.479 --> 02:58:41.620]  I'm a straight shooter.
[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:42.639]  I'm a Boy Scout.
[02:58:43.739 --> 02:58:44.540]  And they know that.
[02:58:45.139 --> 02:58:46.739]  And I'm a Boy Scout by choice.
[02:58:46.739 --> 02:58:49.000]  I'm not a Boy Scout when it comes to I'm Naive.
[02:58:49.100 --> 02:58:49.700]  Quite the opposite.
[02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:52.840]  I know how bad evil and corruption and manipulation is.
[02:58:52.860 --> 02:58:57.020]  And I make a conscious decision not to tap into the knowledge of evil and use it.
[02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:02.600]  Because the knowledge of evil is learning how evil works, learning how the systems of it work.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:07.659]  And before, when we were innocent, we only had the knowledge of good, and it all made perfect sense.
[02:59:07.819 --> 02:59:17.079]  But then once the virus, the mind virus of the knowledge of evil sinks into people, they end up putting on the ring of Mordor, the ring of Saron.
[02:59:18.559 --> 02:59:24.360]  Oh, you'll win with the ring for a while, but everything you do comes back on you and everyone else ten times with death.
[02:59:27.729 --> 02:59:33.049]  I refuse to put on the ring, but I know the ring.
[02:59:34.090 --> 02:59:36.010]  Oh, I know the knowledge of evil.
[02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:41.049]  And people need to understand what we're facing.
[02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:43.809]  So, I wanted to get Dr.
[02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:46.930]  Kirk Elliott on with his views on all this, but here he is last week.
[02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:50.860]  Predicting that, oh, you'll see gold go down at first.
[02:59:51.059 --> 02:59:55.680]  He said that weeks before Trump won, but then he predicted very soon you'd see it rise.
[02:59:55.940 --> 02:59:58.659]  And it's not just about if you invested in gold and silver to know that.
[02:59:59.139 --> 03:00:06.459]  It's important to understand all the other geopolitical economic trends he's laying out that for years have been dead on accuracy.
[03:00:06.459 --> 03:00:09.000]  He's been on with us almost 14 months, are dead on.
[03:00:09.799 --> 03:00:20.459]  Gold hits one week high as Russia-Ukraine tensions boost Russia's safety, CNBC. Stocks fall, gold rises, Bitcoin steadies as geopolitical tensions mount.
[03:00:21.219 --> 03:00:25.360]  Gold surges, Goldman Sachs bullish 3,000 forecast amid global uncertainties.
[03:00:26.139 --> 03:00:31.520]  UAE surpasses London to become world's second largest gold hub as Asia demands grow.
[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:35.120]  Three reasons why gold and silver and oil are rallying.
[03:00:36.180 --> 03:00:39.879]  A lot on the new dock worker strike and so much more with Dr.
[03:00:40.079 --> 03:00:40.680]  Kirk Elliott.
[03:00:40.899 --> 03:00:44.200]  Now, I'm going to give him the floor now, and he's got video clips, everything else.
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:48.739]  He sent us tons of documents, so the crew does a great job of their best, making sure when he calls for something, getting it.
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:56.319]  But Doc, make sure, because there's a lot here, you tell them what's coming 30 seconds before so they can get it, because he sent like 30 or 40, 50 exhibits.
[03:00:57.719 --> 03:01:00.969]  And Then I'm going to come back on at the end with you.
[03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:12.430]  I'm going to be listening, but I've got a lot of strategic things going on here, and I've certainly learned in the last seven years of being under lawfare that I have to make all the decisions, even if you have great lawyers.
[03:01:13.309 --> 03:01:15.110]  So I'm fighting on a lot of fronts here.
[03:01:16.149 --> 03:01:17.909]  Yeah, when you support Elliott, he's a sponsor.
[03:01:18.049 --> 03:01:18.430]  That's great.
[03:01:18.610 --> 03:01:21.270]  But I only bring you things that I think are really going to be good for you.
[03:01:21.350 --> 03:01:25.290]  And if you'd have got silver and gold, you know, 14 months ago when you first started coming on, look where you'd be today.
[03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:27.930]  It's the best performing investment, period.
[03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:29.709]  But for me, it's not even about that.
[03:01:29.770 --> 03:01:31.190]  You can't trust the digital system.
[03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:32.709]  You can't trust, you know, these systems.
[03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:33.790]  They can grab it all from you.
[03:01:34.229 --> 03:01:41.030]  It's down to farmland, guns, guts, neighbors you can trust, skills you have, relationship with God, number one, and gold and silver.
[03:01:41.290 --> 03:01:42.389]  And Bitcoin's great, too.
[03:01:42.430 --> 03:01:43.209]  That's a good thing to have as well.
[03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:43.870]  But it's a basket.
[03:01:44.630 --> 03:01:51.270]  So you need to go to kepm.com forward slash gold, kepm.com forward slash gold, 720-605-3900.
[03:01:51.409 --> 03:01:52.270]  Tell them I'll send you.
[03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:57.870]  And a little percent of the little percent they get when they sell you gold at wholesale goes to this operation.
[03:01:58.129 --> 03:02:01.629]  I could have gold sponsors that have offered me now five times more than he offers.
[03:02:01.729 --> 03:02:06.569]  Big ones that all the other hosts have, sponsors, and I won't do it because...
[03:02:07.909 --> 03:02:09.090]  You're being overcharged.
[03:02:09.270 --> 03:02:10.889]  I don't say that to say we're the place to go.
[03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:12.530]  There's the reason he's the biggest in the country.
[03:02:12.829 --> 03:02:15.129]  It's because he has the lowest, best rates, and the best service.
[03:02:16.110 --> 03:02:18.250]  And I just will not be involved.
[03:02:18.409 --> 03:02:19.590]  I mean, all our problems will be solved.
[03:02:19.629 --> 03:02:20.950]  And you'd listen to me.
[03:02:21.930 --> 03:02:23.049]  And you'd get it.
[03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:25.209]  Because I know what other hosts are doing and making.
[03:02:25.809 --> 03:02:27.049]  I don't need a private jet.
[03:02:27.049 --> 03:02:27.829]  I don't need a mansion.
[03:02:27.850 --> 03:02:28.649]  I need my integrity.
[03:02:29.610 --> 03:02:31.569]  I'll put my life on the line I have for integrity.
[03:02:31.729 --> 03:02:32.510]  It's my shield.
[03:02:33.350 --> 03:02:33.770]  Okay?
[03:02:34.110 --> 03:02:37.430]  And it's not just that I made the decision to have integrity, it's my spirit.
[03:02:37.450 --> 03:02:40.489]  But I can intellectually and spiritually understand why it's like that.
[03:02:40.610 --> 03:02:51.110]  If I even think about doing something wrong, and I don't even mean, like, think like I want to do it, but about war game making an evil choice, I literally feel the Holy Spirit begin to go out of the room.
[03:02:51.810 --> 03:03:01.989]  And that's why Satanists do rituals and rape kids and sacrifice people is to get God away from them, to fully remove God, because God will not be around that, so they can then fully take them over.
[03:03:02.309 --> 03:03:13.389]  And I wish evil people could understand what it's like to actually have the Holy Spirit and to just have God literally start giving you such incredible knowledge and such incredible discernment and such over-the-horizon understanding.
[03:03:13.389 --> 03:03:18.870]  These people serving Satan have no idea what they're missing, not being under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[03:03:19.969 --> 03:03:20.889]  Our Lord and Savior.
[03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:22.489]  So, Dr.
[03:03:22.649 --> 03:03:23.590]  Elliott, you've got the floor.
[03:03:23.729 --> 03:03:25.770]  I'll be back in the last 10 minutes or so.
[03:03:26.270 --> 03:03:27.389]  But I've got to...
[03:03:28.659 --> 03:03:30.500]  Make major decisions right now, my friend.
[03:03:30.639 --> 03:03:35.719]  But listeners, we need immediate support at thealexjonesstore.com that is not owned by M4. It's not owned by me.
[03:03:35.719 --> 03:03:36.520]  It's a huge sponsor.
[03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:38.180]  The bad guys can't take it away.
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:40.139]  They're running around saying it's theirs too in the news.
[03:03:40.219 --> 03:03:42.459]  It's all lies to discourage you from supporting.
[03:03:42.459 --> 03:03:43.799]  It's just like the Democrat lawyers say.
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:44.600]  Don't send him money.
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:45.239]  He's going down.
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:46.219]  That was two years ago.
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.819]  We're not going anywhere unless they can convince you of that lie.
[03:03:49.260 --> 03:03:53.899]  I would never tell you something that I believe is one trillionth a lie.
[03:03:54.729 --> 03:03:55.110]  All right?
[03:03:55.389 --> 03:03:58.389]  My whole mission is to be absolutely as accurate as possible.
[03:03:58.610 --> 03:03:59.930]  That's why we're tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:00.010 --> 03:04:00.750]  And you know that!
[03:04:01.149 --> 03:04:05.450]  I would never have told you to get silver if it wasn't going to go up 50% in my mind.
[03:04:05.729 --> 03:04:07.709]  And it did, just like he said 14 months ago.
[03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:08.489]  That was the time.
[03:04:08.850 --> 03:04:12.209]  So when I tell you something, I tell you on the verge of World War III, you already know it.
[03:04:12.250 --> 03:04:13.110]  It's not even denied now.
[03:04:13.649 --> 03:04:15.129]  I've been building towards this.
[03:04:15.409 --> 03:04:16.209]  Pray for Trump.
[03:04:16.350 --> 03:04:16.930]  Pray for peace.
[03:04:17.329 --> 03:04:21.909]  Pray that God, you know, send his angels to stop this war.
[03:04:22.030 --> 03:04:22.989]  This is serious.
[03:04:23.409 --> 03:04:24.350]  And support us.
[03:04:24.430 --> 03:04:25.290]  We are critical in this fight.
[03:04:25.389 --> 03:04:26.309]  Do I need to convince you of that?
[03:04:26.350 --> 03:04:26.569]  No.
[03:04:26.909 --> 03:04:28.889]  You have to convince yourself to take action now.
[03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:36.350]  Get great Patriot gear, great supplements, more at thealexjohnstore.com and make the right move and get silver and gold right now at kapm.com forward slash gold.
[03:04:36.629 --> 03:04:36.809]  Dr.
[03:04:36.930 --> 03:04:37.950]  Elliott, take over, my friend.
[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:39.870]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:04:40.110 --> 03:04:41.870]  It's great to be back again.
[03:04:42.069 --> 03:04:43.510]  And there's a lot of stuff going on.
[03:04:43.770 --> 03:04:52.629]  And, you know, in your opening statements here for this segment, I'm encouraged that, you know what, God is still on the throne.
[03:04:52.829 --> 03:04:53.750]  He never left.
[03:04:53.969 --> 03:04:56.610]  None of this is a surprise to him, right?
[03:04:56.770 --> 03:04:59.209]  But here's where he's still on the throne.
[03:04:59.510 --> 03:05:01.069]  He is going to give us words.
[03:05:01.209 --> 03:05:06.409]  He is going to give us He is going to give us courage to navigate through this.
[03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:08.290]  And, you know, some of us say, well, I don't know what to do.
[03:05:08.370 --> 03:05:09.610]  I want to stick my head in the sand.
[03:05:09.809 --> 03:05:10.709]  Forget about it all.
[03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:15.129]  Well, if you lack wisdom, the answer is simple.
[03:05:15.309 --> 03:05:18.049]  James 1.5 says, ask God for it.
[03:05:18.430 --> 03:05:19.670]  You know, it's my interpretation.
[03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:20.329]  He's a gentleman.
[03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:24.250]  He's a good father, and he's going to give you more than what you could ever ask for.
[03:05:24.430 --> 03:05:29.110]  And this is what we need in this time that we're living in.
[03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:30.469]  We need wisdom.
[03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:34.700]  Right, to make the wise decisions and apply the knowledge that we have.
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:43.479]  We need discernment to be able to understand the good voices from the bad that are just infiltrating the airwaves and the internet everywhere.
[03:05:43.719 --> 03:05:46.379]  It's like not everybody that's out there you should listen to, right?
[03:05:46.600 --> 03:05:49.260]  So there's a lot going on.
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:06:05.739]  And like Alex said, For a long time, we've said, so if Kamala would have won, I think gold and silver would have absolutely gone through the ceiling, because of the flight for quality aspect of it.
[03:06:05.879 --> 03:06:09.719]  And everyone would have known, okay, the economy's toast, we're done.
[03:06:10.540 --> 03:06:18.819]  But with Trump winning, the initial knee-jerk overreaction to Trump being an amazing businessman.
[03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:22.430]  An amazing president, a leader.
[03:06:22.569 --> 03:06:27.030]  We need a strong leader because of some of his policies that he's gonna bring to the table.
[03:06:27.149 --> 03:06:28.809]  That's gonna bring political consequences.
[03:06:29.209 --> 03:06:33.090]  And you need somebody who can tell Congress, stop spending so much stinking money.
[03:06:33.649 --> 03:06:35.090]  Don't raise the debt ceiling.
[03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:46.209]  Work on not just printing more money, which is inflation, like what Ron Paul said recently, talking to Elon Musk on Axe.
[03:06:46.739 --> 03:06:51.780]  And this is what I wrote in my dissertation way back in 2007.
[03:06:52.719 --> 03:06:55.239]  Inflation is not rising prices.
[03:06:56.360 --> 03:06:58.559]  Rising prices are a symptom of inflation.
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.700]  Inflation is truly just an increase in the money supply.
[03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:09.780]  Well, when you're printing money like there's no tomorrow to fund every stimulus under the sun, you're going to have inflationary pressures.
[03:07:09.979 --> 03:07:14.680]  And this is the world that Trump just inherited.
[03:07:15.020 --> 03:07:18.639]  So Trump inherited a nightmare of an economy.
[03:07:18.959 --> 03:07:27.889]  And as he comes in, He's not gonna be able to fix things overnight, even though it's like he's great.
[03:07:28.129 --> 03:07:28.950]  He's fantastic.
[03:07:29.229 --> 03:07:34.989]  There's nobody better appointed for this job for this time in history than President Trump.
[03:07:35.250 --> 03:07:37.850]  But it's not gonna turn around overnight.
[03:07:37.850 --> 03:07:38.670]  He can't.
[03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:48.290]  Because there's been so much damage that's been done by the Biden administration and by them spending like drunken sailors, printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[03:07:48.549 --> 03:07:56.590]  So what is this nightmare of an economy that Trump inherited that's basically backdroped by lies?
[03:07:57.149 --> 03:07:59.850]  It's like, oh, we've got great job numbers again this month.
[03:07:59.989 --> 03:08:01.590]  Yay, yay, Biden.
[03:08:02.090 --> 03:08:06.209]  But then 30 days later, they revise the numbers and they go down.
[03:08:06.350 --> 03:08:08.709]  It's like, wait, we didn't create 100,000 jobs.
[03:08:08.709 --> 03:08:10.590]  We actually lost like 80,000.
[03:08:10.709 --> 03:08:11.030]  It's like, what?
[03:08:11.190 --> 03:08:13.350]  This happens over and over and over again.
[03:08:13.569 --> 03:08:19.629]  So he's inheriting basically a bunch of lies, right?
[03:08:20.010 --> 03:08:20.950]  But you know what?
[03:08:21.069 --> 03:08:24.030]  The election told us that the people don't buy the lies.
[03:08:24.939 --> 03:08:28.440]  They're not actually thinking, yeah, the economy is great.
[03:08:28.559 --> 03:08:31.540]  And it was Bill Clinton that said people, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:08:31.860 --> 03:08:33.280]  People vote with their wallets.
[03:08:33.379 --> 03:08:36.059]  And they know that Biden's economy hasn't been good.
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:44.100]  And that the Harris economy following in Biden's footsteps, like she said on The View, how would you change anything than what Biden was doing?
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:44.959]  I'm sorry, I wouldn't.
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:48.819]  It's like, okay, you just shot yourself in the foot, lady, right?
[03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:52.760]  So we have actually been in a recession for years.
[03:08:53.530 --> 03:08:59.469]  For years, since 2020, we've actually been in a recession, and our wallets and our pocketbooks would tell us that.
[03:08:59.690 --> 03:09:00.690]  What is a recession?
[03:09:00.909 --> 03:09:08.090]  It's a couple quarters, and that's just two quarters, of declining output, declining wages, declining production, right?
[03:09:08.170 --> 03:09:08.989]  This is what we've had.
[03:09:09.129 --> 03:09:11.770]  We've had this since COVID, right?
[03:09:11.870 --> 03:09:15.309]  But it's been masked with massive amounts of stimulus.
[03:09:16.149 --> 03:09:25.530]  And so when you look at when Biden became president, what did he do to create the framework where Trump just won?
[03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:28.409]  And this is part of the global economy here.
[03:09:28.489 --> 03:09:33.389]  This is part of the mess that Trump needs to get us out of.
[03:09:33.969 --> 03:09:43.030]  So in January of 21, basically, Congress had passed a $900 billion stimulus, right?
[03:09:43.090 --> 03:09:44.829]  And it's like, oh man, it's a big stimulus.
[03:09:44.989 --> 03:10:03.409]  But then Biden comes in, and right after that, The Wall Street Journal just did a scathing article on this, and I think it was amazing what they had said, because he then is talking to Senator Manchin in West Virginia,
[03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:09.309]  and he wants to do another $1.9 trillion stimulus.
[03:10:10.110 --> 03:10:12.530]  It's like, man, this is ridiculous.
[03:10:13.010 --> 03:10:14.750]  And Manchin said, don't do it.
[03:10:15.010 --> 03:10:15.409]  Don't do it.
[03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:19.549]  And President Biden told him, said, hey, Joe, I'm gonna do it anyways.
[03:10:20.290 --> 03:10:21.450]  We've got to get this out of this.
[03:10:21.549 --> 03:10:26.090]  So this, again, a knee-jerk overreaction to a bad economic event.
[03:10:26.290 --> 03:10:35.510]  They thought that they learned in 2009 that if you don't do enough, it's going to put this into economic stagnation for a long time.
[03:10:35.649 --> 03:10:36.629]  So what did they do?
[03:10:36.809 --> 03:10:39.530]  They just threw money at it, that we printed out of thin air.
[03:10:39.829 --> 03:10:45.209]  That caused the worst inflationary cycle that we have seen in this country.
[03:10:45.959 --> 03:10:48.459]  And we're still feeling the impacts of that today.
[03:10:48.719 --> 03:11:00.680]  Now, we're going to keep feeling the impacts of that moving forward because the rest of the world knows that inflation is just when you print money like there's no tomorrow, that devalues the currency.
[03:11:00.680 --> 03:11:08.340]  If you were another country or another group of countries like BRICS, why would you want the US dollar if we keep deflating it by printing and printing and printing?
[03:11:08.559 --> 03:11:10.420]  It becomes worthless at some point.
[03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:12.059]  It becomes like monopoly money.
[03:11:12.569 --> 03:11:13.969]  Well, this is where we are.
[03:11:14.090 --> 03:11:22.770]  And this is the world that Trump inherited moving into his next four years is an America that's in debt up to its eyeballs.
[03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:30.969]  It's an America where the inflationary pressures are so extreme that I don't know how you get out of it.
[03:11:31.049 --> 03:11:37.829]  And I think that the Fed made an absolutely catastrophic change.
[03:11:38.409 --> 03:11:39.690]  Bad, bad decision.
[03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:41.510]  And that is...
[03:11:42.639 --> 03:11:44.100]  We've got, what did they do?
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:50.280]  So the Fed decided, okay, two months ago, they're going to lower interest rates by 50 basis points, half a percent.
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:54.979]  Well, then, last month, they lowered them by a quarter of a percent.
[03:11:55.159 --> 03:11:57.840]  So it's three quarters of a percent.
[03:11:58.739 --> 03:12:01.420]  In the last two months or what interest rates came down.
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:08.620]  You don't lower interest rates with the forecast of a growing economy, which is what Trump brought to the table.
[03:12:08.799 --> 03:12:12.280]  It was the mandate that America voted for, right?
[03:12:12.579 --> 03:12:14.540]  It's like, okay, Trump's gonna grow the economy.
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:18.379]  It's the economy that's why people are, so many people are voting.
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:19.459]  They're feeling the pinch.
[03:12:19.620 --> 03:12:21.379]  They're feeling the inflationary pressures.
[03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:22.879]  They're feeling the loss of wages.
[03:12:23.459 --> 03:12:24.420]  And you know what?
[03:12:24.559 --> 03:12:24.940]  They voted.
[03:12:25.690 --> 03:12:33.909]  So when you lower interest rates, it's like this fire of the inflation is not extinguished, right?
[03:12:34.030 --> 03:12:44.389]  Because when you lower interest rates to slow down, you know, if the economy is terrible, you lower interest rates to stimulate growth, right?
[03:12:44.569 --> 03:12:49.549]  If the economy is projected to grow, you don't lower interest rates because that'll make inflation worse.
[03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:51.969]  Exactly what they just did, right?
[03:12:52.899 --> 03:12:59.139]  Because they lowered the second quarter of a point reduction two days after the election.
[03:12:59.340 --> 03:13:01.579]  They knew that Trump was going to be president.
[03:13:02.219 --> 03:13:04.180]  And yet they still lowered interest rates.
[03:13:04.360 --> 03:13:07.180]  That is going to bring a lot of inflation to the table.
[03:13:07.639 --> 03:13:10.719]  And who is going to get blamed for this?
[03:13:10.860 --> 03:13:12.200]  The guy holding the bag.
[03:13:13.139 --> 03:13:14.860]  Trump is going to get blamed for it.
[03:13:14.979 --> 03:13:17.940]  Just like Trump is going to get blamed for what's happening in Russia and Ukraine.
[03:13:18.079 --> 03:13:19.879]  Trump is going to get blamed for a lot of things.
[03:13:20.079 --> 03:13:25.920]  Because a lot of the things in these wheels that have been turning are changing.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:31.579]  And we're going to see the fruit on that tree manifest itself during the next four years.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:36.159]  So let's look at a couple of things that Trump did inherit here.
[03:13:36.379 --> 03:13:51.069]  So there's some Kelly Evans from CNBC. I've done a lot of reporting on this on the federal budget and how you can go to subtable S4 in the U.S. budget on whitehouse.gov and look at the actual spending.
[03:13:51.209 --> 03:13:54.290]  Well, she did it in a nice, concise article, which I talk too much.
[03:13:54.489 --> 03:13:55.790]  Mine are never all that concise.
[03:13:56.110 --> 03:14:07.409]  But here's where Medicare plus health, Medicaid's chip, and to a lesser extent, the Obamacare subsidies, is 28% of all expenditures.
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:10.600]  Social Security is 21%.
[03:14:10.600 --> 03:14:14.399]  Defense is 18%, and net interest payments are 14%.
[03:14:14.399 --> 03:14:29.059]  You add all of those up, that's 81% of all federal tax revenue coming in goes towards mandatory payments, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, women, infant, children programs, and the interest on our debt.
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:30.600]  That is so much.
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:32.540]  What about defense spending?
[03:14:32.659 --> 03:14:33.540]  What about everything else?
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:35.920]  That's not even included, right?
[03:14:36.040 --> 03:14:50.700]  Which is why Vivek and Elon and going in and making the government efficient and getting rid of a lot of this waste, like the Department of Education, whatever they're gonna do, is so incredibly needed, so incredibly wise.
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:15:04.409]  But this is what Trump inherited and why those positions are so necessary Because you can't run the country on the 19% that's left of everything that we bring in.
[03:15:04.670 --> 03:15:08.329]  So how bad has it gotten?
[03:15:08.649 --> 03:15:15.709]  I mean, I was just doing some research this morning before Alex called and said, hey, can you do the show?
[03:15:15.790 --> 03:15:20.450]  It's like, okay, our deficit is absolutely exploding.
[03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:36.059]  In America right now, in the last 30 days, let's listen to this, in October, the last 30 days, $586 billion was actually added.
[03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:39.280]  To our debt, 586 billion.
[03:15:39.399 --> 03:15:40.319]  That's what we spent, right?
[03:15:40.780 --> 03:15:51.219]  It's like, wait a second, 586 times 12, if you were to extrapolate that out for the full year, that's like $7 trillion that we're on the pace to spend.
[03:15:51.379 --> 03:15:53.219]  It's like, oh my word, this is out of control.
[03:15:53.459 --> 03:15:57.100]  Well, what did we bring in in federal tax revenue during that time?
[03:15:58.399 --> 03:15:59.219]  326 billion.
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:11.719]  So we're spending 586, we're bringing in 326, So the net difference there is about adding another $3 trillion to our debt in a full year.
[03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:13.219]  See, here's the problem.
[03:16:13.479 --> 03:16:19.280]  The debt is increasing by 24%.
[03:16:20.980 --> 03:16:25.860]  If you look at the revenue, it's decreasing by 19%.
[03:16:25.860 --> 03:16:29.959]  So you've got debt increasing by 24, income coming down by 19.
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:36.579]  That's a 43% differential between spending and income.
[03:16:36.579 --> 03:16:37.920]  That's unsustainable.
[03:16:38.489 --> 03:16:41.670]  This is the economy that Trump inherits, right?
[03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:45.729]  And it's gonna be a hard road out.
[03:16:45.889 --> 03:16:49.110]  So I don't want people to think, yes, the most amazing thing happened.
[03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:51.930]  The first victory in this battle, Trump won.
[03:16:52.090 --> 03:16:52.590]  It's amazing.
[03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:54.149]  He's gonna turn things around overnight.
[03:16:54.409 --> 03:16:56.389]  You can't turn that around overnight.
[03:16:56.590 --> 03:16:59.950]  This is gonna be a hard path moving forward, which is why we have to pray.
[03:17:00.110 --> 03:17:01.590]  We have to ask for wisdom.
[03:17:01.770 --> 03:17:03.190]  We have to have discernment.
[03:17:03.629 --> 03:17:04.629]  And what we listen to.
[03:17:04.809 --> 03:17:07.090]  Well, you know who else has discernment?
[03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:09.430]  And I'm going to go into this after the break.
[03:17:10.409 --> 03:17:11.489]  But the banks.
[03:17:12.500 --> 03:17:20.739]  The mortgage rates have been going up, even though the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by three quarters of a point.
[03:17:20.959 --> 03:17:28.959]  So this tells us something incredible about where they think the economy is headed, even with Trump going to turn things around.
[03:17:29.139 --> 03:17:31.219]  So we'll get into that right after the break.
[03:17:31.440 --> 03:17:36.399]  Again, go to KEPM.com forward slash gold if you have any questions and we'd love to answer them for you.
[03:17:36.559 --> 03:17:37.159]  We'll be back soon.
[03:17:37.459 --> 03:17:38.979]  I'm here to tell you, brother.
[03:17:39.579 --> 03:17:42.680]  Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:17:43.719 --> 03:17:47.239]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:17:47.420 --> 03:17:50.059]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:50.940]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:17:51.899 --> 03:17:53.260]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:17:53.379 --> 03:17:54.319]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[03:17:54.420 --> 03:17:55.059]  I'm not going to bite it.
[03:17:55.979 --> 03:17:58.680]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:17:59.579 --> 03:18:00.459]  Oh, no.
[03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:03.399]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:18:03.979 --> 03:18:05.399]  I did it all.
[03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:09.489]  From the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:18:09.690 --> 03:18:10.430]  That's why, right here.
[03:18:11.170 --> 03:18:16.270]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:18.049]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:18:18.610 --> 03:18:19.989]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:18:22.700 --> 03:18:26.680]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:18:26.799 --> 03:18:29.979]  And I am doing a plug here because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[03:18:30.500 --> 03:18:33.459]  Infowars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:18:33.579 --> 03:18:36.780]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another working with great folks.
[03:18:37.459 --> 03:18:38.500]  So we're back.
[03:18:38.739 --> 03:18:43.600]  And when I left right before the break, we were talking about mortgage rates.
[03:18:43.959 --> 03:18:45.399]  So here's the interesting thing.
[03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:48.790]  The Fed lowered interest rates three-quarters of a point.
[03:18:48.969 --> 03:18:50.510]  What did mortgage rates do?
[03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:53.110]  They're over 7%.
[03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:54.530]  7%.
[03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:56.829]  So why, though?
[03:18:57.190 --> 03:19:05.569]  Wouldn't you think that mortgage rates would come down if interest rates are coming down, where banks lend money back and forth to each other, which is what the Fed does?
[03:19:05.770 --> 03:19:09.950]  It's like, no, they won't because banks are lending out their private money.
[03:19:10.940 --> 03:19:15.780]  And so they can actually offer whatever rate they want to.
[03:19:16.100 --> 03:19:22.100]  And mortgage demand tanked 11% as interest rates are surging higher.
[03:19:22.219 --> 03:19:23.000]  It's like, wait a second.
[03:19:23.399 --> 03:19:24.979]  Interest rates have been coming down.
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:26.139]  So here's the thing.
[03:19:26.889 --> 03:19:33.170]  Mortgage rates, to me, are one of the most sensitive things that tell us the status of the economy.
[03:19:33.389 --> 03:19:41.829]  Because if you think about it, you go buy a house, maybe it's $300,000 or $3 million or $10 million, whatever the price of your house is.
[03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:45.690]  The bank is going to give you a lump sum to pay the seller.
[03:19:45.829 --> 03:19:50.729]  And then you have to pay the bank back after 15 years or 30 years or however long your mortgage is, right?
[03:19:50.889 --> 03:19:55.750]  So in today's world, Alex and I talk about it all the time when we're on the air.
[03:19:55.909 --> 03:20:00.209]  We don't even know what's gonna happen tomorrow, let alone 30 years from now.
[03:20:00.430 --> 03:20:04.170]  Neither do the actuaries at these banks and these economists, right?
[03:20:04.329 --> 03:20:13.409]  So when they don't view the economy moving forward, As something that, well, hey, Jane Doe, we're giving you this loan.
[03:20:13.870 --> 03:20:21.049]  And boy, with wages coming down, with all this political conflict, geopolitical nightmare, there's wars and rumors of wars.
[03:20:21.370 --> 03:20:22.950]  Ooh, the inflationary pressures.
[03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:24.809]  We just don't know if we're gonna get our money back.
[03:20:25.090 --> 03:20:28.110]  We're gonna actually give you a higher interest rate.
[03:20:28.350 --> 03:20:31.229]  Because they wanna have a reward to the risk they're taking.
[03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:36.290]  This is why interest rates at banks are going higher, because they don't think...
[03:20:37.020 --> 03:20:39.520]  The economy, and I'm not even talking long term.
[03:20:40.319 --> 03:20:48.959]  People know in their heart of hearts that Trump is gonna grow the economy, he's gonna make things better, he's gonna bring jobs back, and it's gonna be fantastic in time.
[03:20:49.340 --> 03:20:57.920]  But over the next year to two, it's gonna take some time to recover from the mayhem that's already been caused by the last administration, right?
[03:20:58.100 --> 03:21:01.899]  So it's during that time that people could default.
[03:21:02.639 --> 03:21:08.340]  It's during that time that people could go into bankruptcy and be late on their payments and have delinquencies.
[03:21:08.540 --> 03:21:16.620]  And this is why the banking sector is so in disarray, undercapitalized, and nervous about what's, right?
[03:21:17.889 --> 03:21:19.430]  So we've talked about the deficit.
[03:21:19.610 --> 03:21:20.469]  We've talked about the debt.
[03:21:20.649 --> 03:21:31.290]  We've talked about how Democrats absolutely blew it during COVID by adding all this debt that we still caused the inflation that we're still reeling from, right?
[03:21:31.549 --> 03:21:41.209]  So when you start to look forward, there's inflationary pressures that are continuing to build because of Trump's policies.
[03:21:41.819 --> 03:21:42.579]  But it's okay.
[03:21:42.719 --> 03:21:44.680]  There's a good inflation, there's a bad inflation, right?
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:51.719]  So a good inflation is when people are working, people are making more money, people can spend and they can afford to spend.
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:22:02.219]  And that will cause the economy to be able to have higher prices because some of the stimulus and because of the injection of capital into the economy, that's actually good inflation.
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:03.899]  I think?
[03:22:22.569 --> 03:22:24.870]  It's the first resort, not even the last resort.
[03:22:24.969 --> 03:22:26.409]  It's like, I wanna just print our way out of it.
[03:22:26.590 --> 03:22:29.510]  Well, that causes inflation while people aren't working.
[03:22:29.649 --> 03:22:30.469]  That's the kiss of death.
[03:22:30.610 --> 03:22:31.809]  That's a bad inflation.
[03:22:32.190 --> 03:22:33.309]  That's stagflation.
[03:22:33.549 --> 03:22:35.350]  And that's what we're in, right?
[03:22:35.489 --> 03:22:43.510]  So there's gonna be inflationary pressures mounting under a growing economy under Trump, just by the default of a growing economy and what that brings.
[03:22:43.690 --> 03:22:55.729]  But when you put tariffs on foreign goods, Until people change their spending habits and stop buying Chinese stuff at Walmart and start buying American stuff, you're going to see higher prices.
[03:22:55.729 --> 03:22:56.989]  They're going to realize, nuts!
[03:22:57.709 --> 03:23:02.190]  This thing that I bought, this game, this doll, whatever it is that you're buying from Walmart, right?
[03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:05.889]  It's like, well, it's 40% to 60% more expensive because of these tariffs.
[03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:12.430]  Well, ultimately, people will change their spending habits and go to something that's equivalent and less expensive.
[03:23:13.290 --> 03:23:17.190]  If there's no tariffs on American goods, they're going to be less expensive.
[03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:18.950]  People are going to start buying American.
[03:23:19.629 --> 03:23:24.430]  But this is what Trump is going to bring to the table.
[03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:25.850]  It's going to be opposition.
[03:23:26.129 --> 03:23:34.989]  Because when you steal money out of other countries' wallets by making their goods more expensive and nobody's gonna wanna buy them, that impacts their economies.
[03:23:35.190 --> 03:23:37.549]  There's gonna be political consequences of that.
[03:23:38.069 --> 03:23:46.329]  Even Chairman Xi in China was talking to Biden earlier in the week and basically, we're gonna work with Trump on this transition.
[03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:50.350]  And this is my interpretation of this conversation, right?
[03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:55.510]  It's like, but there's gonna be strings attached and they're gonna be really short strings, right?
[03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:58.370]  You push too hard and we're gonna retaliate.
[03:23:58.569 --> 03:24:00.049]  Okay, that's the gist of the message.
[03:24:00.680 --> 03:24:02.040]  Well, how are they going to retaliate?
[03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:06.020]  Well, what they're saying is there's going to economic warfare coming.
[03:24:06.459 --> 03:24:08.579]  So what could they do?
[03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:11.899]  Well, they still have almost a trillion dollars worth of US Treasuries.
[03:24:12.079 --> 03:24:14.899]  Just start flooding the open market with those things.
[03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:18.239]  It demolishes the value of the US dollar.
[03:24:18.520 --> 03:24:23.399]  And unless somebody buys them, the dollar starts to wither away into nothingness, right?
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:25.719]  Oh, there is a buyer of last resort always.
[03:24:25.899 --> 03:24:26.399]  It's the Fed.
[03:24:27.010 --> 03:24:31.709]  So the Fed will just print money out of thin air to buy our US Treasuries, and that's gonna create more inflation.
[03:24:31.989 --> 03:24:34.030]  This is the danger zone that we're in.
[03:24:34.209 --> 03:24:46.159]  Now, when you look at the global economy outside of economic warfare, what's happening in Russia right now that Alex just alluded to, Is insane.
[03:24:46.500 --> 03:24:57.159]  So the West is escalating the war response of Putin two days after Putin signs a new nuclear doctrine.
[03:24:57.399 --> 03:24:59.260]  What does the nuclear doctrine say?
[03:24:59.639 --> 03:25:07.299]  It basically said, hey, if we're attacked on Russian soil with any kind of conventional weapons, we can retaliate with nuclear ones.
[03:25:07.969 --> 03:25:11.290]  It's like that is mutually assured destruction that Alex was talking about.
[03:25:11.530 --> 03:25:14.629]  It's like nobody wants to do that, but Putin is so ticked.
[03:25:14.770 --> 03:25:20.770]  Why would he sign this doctrine that says if we're gonna be attacked, and what did Biden do?
[03:25:20.969 --> 03:25:26.569]  I mean, I don't even know where Biden is, but it's like he's on Gilligan's Island somewhere.
[03:25:26.569 --> 03:25:42.989]  He comes out of this rainforest with a podium in the middle of the jungle and has this little press conference in response to all this and says, well, Yeah, we approved the use of our long-range ballistic missiles and that Ukraine can use them.
[03:25:43.090 --> 03:25:45.030]  And then he walks off into the jungle again.
[03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.649]  It's like, what?
[03:25:45.909 --> 03:25:47.270]  What just happened here?
[03:25:47.430 --> 03:25:50.899]  One of the most important geopolitical statements Ever.
[03:25:51.079 --> 03:25:52.299]  And there he is.
[03:25:52.420 --> 03:25:54.940]  He's wandering around in the jungle like Gilligan.
[03:25:55.200 --> 03:26:12.340]  And while this comes after Putin signs this nuclear doctrine, and then Ukraine fires long-range ballistic missiles deep into Russia, hits military targets after Putin said he was gonna respond with nuclear capability to defend themselves.
[03:26:13.020 --> 03:26:14.399]  It's like, as Alex, right?
[03:26:14.559 --> 03:26:22.540]  Did we just start World War III? Well, the rest of the investing world is taking this and markets all over the globe.
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:27.899]  The German stock market, the other European stock markets, Japanese stock market, Japanese bonds.
[03:26:28.420 --> 03:26:32.940]  They're all tanking the U.S. stock market down like 400 points today, right?
[03:26:33.059 --> 03:26:44.319]  And it's like, because markets don't like war, they don't like uncertainty, chaos, turbulence, change, they thrive on consistency of future expectations, and we don't have that right now.
[03:26:44.909 --> 03:26:47.670]  We're on the verge of thermonuclear war.
[03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:52.049]  And because of that, gold and silver are now starting to go up again.
[03:26:52.270 --> 03:26:58.069]  After the dust settles, they came down for the last two weeks like we predicted they would.
[03:26:58.329 --> 03:27:01.850]  Under Trump victory, Trump is gonna grow the economy.
[03:27:01.969 --> 03:27:03.750]  He's gonna do great for America, right?
[03:27:03.850 --> 03:27:04.329]  That's great.
[03:27:04.489 --> 03:27:13.659]  But now that the dust settles, people are realizing, oh, The unrealized commercial real estate losses in China, well, that's a bad thing.
[03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:16.379]  The unsustainable debt all over the world, that's a bad thing.
[03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:27.899]  This march towards central bank digital currency globally, maybe Trump can change that in America, but globally, it's a complete loss of freedom and intrusion, and that's not gonna change.
[03:27:28.059 --> 03:27:30.319]  The global order just didn't change.
[03:27:31.059 --> 03:27:35.020]  America's gonna change for the better, but you can't wipe away all the world's debts.
[03:27:35.270 --> 03:27:35.510]  Right?
[03:27:35.770 --> 03:27:39.969]  So as you look at this, people are starting to wake up.
[03:27:40.049 --> 03:27:45.510]  The hedge funds, the big banks, and the commercial interest is saying, all right, back to normal.
[03:27:45.709 --> 03:27:46.430]  The dust settled.
[03:27:46.590 --> 03:27:48.069]  We can now see clearly again.
[03:27:48.270 --> 03:27:50.989]  And this is going to be good for America, but not good for the world.
[03:27:51.149 --> 03:27:57.309]  When you look at what Trump is doing and adding tariffs on top of foreign goods, that's not good for the world.
[03:27:57.469 --> 03:27:59.030]  But it's great for us.
[03:27:59.579 --> 03:28:14.899]  And finally, we have a president that says, I care more about American interests than I do the rest of the world, versus what we just are coming from, which is a president that says, I care about the globalist interest, and well, America is secondary to that.
[03:28:15.329 --> 03:28:18.129]  Boy, the tables just turned right away.
[03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:20.309]  And it's really incredible.
[03:28:20.729 --> 03:28:24.229]  And global inflation is getting worse.
[03:28:24.489 --> 03:28:33.209]  You've got central banks around the world that have been printing money like there's no tomorrow to fund stimulus ever since COVID. See, this is bad.
[03:28:33.530 --> 03:28:38.270]  And the Central Bank of India...
[03:28:38.290 --> 03:28:42.450]  The chief of that central bank basically said, he warned the world.
[03:28:42.670 --> 03:28:47.909]  He said, there's growing global inflation and it really can't be stopped.
[03:28:48.090 --> 03:28:51.569]  So what are you starting to see banks do, central banks around the world?
[03:28:51.909 --> 03:28:53.610]  They're allocating into gold.
[03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:55.770]  They're backing up their positions with gold.
[03:28:55.930 --> 03:29:00.610]  The BRICS nations are gonna do 40% backing of gold to their currency, right?
[03:29:00.750 --> 03:29:04.840]  So here I was thinking a little more philosophically Over the last couple of days.
[03:29:05.159 --> 03:29:08.540]  And Alex was talking about a couple of buckets, right?
[03:29:08.700 --> 03:29:10.979]  Precious metals as a safety hedge in Bitcoin, right?
[03:29:11.040 --> 03:29:13.100]  It's like, okay, let's look at this.
[03:29:13.239 --> 03:29:24.600]  Because to me, in somebody's mind, they both kind of fulfill some of the same inherent needs of privacy and growth and protection, right?
[03:29:24.639 --> 03:29:33.000]  So when you look at the history of money, history of money, money started as barter way back in the day, ancient times.
[03:29:33.440 --> 03:29:36.420]  Or you could be trading beads or rocks or whatever, back and forth.
[03:29:36.520 --> 03:29:37.500]  It was very inconvenient.
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:39.639]  And then you had gold.
[03:29:39.879 --> 03:29:42.799]  So barter was exchanged for gold.
[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:46.000]  And then gold morphed into paper.
[03:29:46.319 --> 03:29:54.360]  It's like, rather than having all these gold ingots and coins and everything like that, how about if we have paper that's a proxy for the metals and you have that backing?
[03:29:54.680 --> 03:29:58.299]  Well, then we got rid of the backing and then it was just paper.
[03:29:58.459 --> 03:30:04.569]  And like 40 years ago, Paper was replaced with plastic as money, with credit cards, right?
[03:30:04.829 --> 03:30:09.969]  And so here we come into this new era, and this to me is where new kind of meets old.
[03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:13.149]  So in the new era, you've got cryptocurrency, right?
[03:30:13.329 --> 03:30:23.569]  So barter to gold, gold to paper, paper to plastic, plastic into crypto for safety, for convenience, for decentralized blockchain that is safe.
[03:30:23.889 --> 03:30:27.469]  Now, an alternative to that would be tangible assets, right?
[03:30:27.729 --> 03:30:29.389]  And a combination of the two.
[03:30:30.040 --> 03:30:34.760]  Gold and silver, you know, almost where you mix the old with the new.
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:36.579]  People want something that's private.
[03:30:36.739 --> 03:30:39.260]  They don't want to be a digital slave in this digital world.
[03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:46.899]  Decentralized blockchain and silver, physical silver, Basically handle both of those things, right?
[03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:47.700]  This is amazing.
[03:30:47.899 --> 03:30:59.500]  And so whenever you have global conflict, whenever you have wars and rumors of wars and everything that we're seeing, and you even look back through biblical passages, right?
[03:30:59.659 --> 03:31:02.700]  Alex said this is one of my degrees in theology.
[03:31:03.020 --> 03:31:11.860]  It's like kings and kingdoms sought after and fought after and died for gold over the years, over the decades, over the centuries, over the millennia, right?
[03:31:11.920 --> 03:31:12.500]  It's like, wow.
[03:31:13.479 --> 03:31:23.280]  So no matter when currency changed from barter to gold to paper to plastic to crypto, there's always been a demand for physical metals.
[03:31:23.459 --> 03:31:31.719]  And so we're entering a new world where central banks and fiat money creation are going the way of the dodo bird.
[03:31:31.920 --> 03:31:33.659]  And what's going to be remaining?
[03:31:33.899 --> 03:31:35.579]  Gold and silver and crypto.
[03:31:38.069 --> 03:31:40.370]  So, one's harder to get into than the other, right?
[03:31:40.430 --> 03:31:42.969]  It's kind of hard to set up a coin wallet and all this digital stuff.
[03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:50.530]  And most of my clients just say, I just want something simple, easy, you know, just wire the funds, you get silver, you take delivery of it or put it in your IRA, that's great.
[03:31:52.209 --> 03:31:56.950]  And some of my younger clients love crypto, or maybe there's a combination of both, right?
[03:31:57.030 --> 03:32:01.829]  But what we're seeing here is a changing of the guard, right?
[03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:06.690]  Because I was looking at This research this morning.
[03:32:06.930 --> 03:32:16.729]  And the United Arab Emirates has actually just surpassed London as the second largest gold trading hub in the world.
[03:32:17.719 --> 03:32:19.139]  In the world, right?
[03:32:19.239 --> 03:32:36.040]  And so in this article, they were talking about how there's been tectonic shifts in the metals market as the East and the BRICS nations have been gobbling up gold to back up their currencies by the hundreds or thousands of tons.
[03:32:36.360 --> 03:32:43.579]  And this shift, this power shift from the West London and New York to the East in Beijing has actually happened.
[03:32:43.819 --> 03:32:52.420]  And so What this gentleman who heads up that exchange, he had this quote.
[03:32:52.540 --> 03:33:04.739]  He said, investment companies and fintechs should develop digital products that enable small-scale and young investors in emerging markets to access gold trading, expanding market participation.
[03:33:05.780 --> 03:33:17.260]  See, he's even saying, in this world, gold or precious metals, I would say, are going to be the safe haven investment.
[03:33:17.520 --> 03:33:18.879]  It could actually be currency.
[03:33:19.059 --> 03:33:20.700]  It could be backing the currency, right?
[03:33:20.799 --> 03:33:33.540]  And so moving in this direction where people start to lose faith and confidence in the system, and they start breaking away from what was into something that's new, we get to take advantage of that.
[03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:35.500]  Even Goldman Sachs.
[03:33:35.770 --> 03:33:36.229]  Right?
[03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:38.829]  The big investment bank.
[03:33:39.010 --> 03:33:41.290]  They're thinking gold's gonna hit 3,000.
[03:33:42.250 --> 03:33:44.850]  It's like, okay, in this bull market, okay, this is great.
[03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:46.229]  Your word's growing.
[03:33:46.430 --> 03:33:49.989]  And why then do we not allocate into gold at my company?
[03:33:50.129 --> 03:33:54.969]  It's because in a bull market in gold, historically, silver outperforms.
[03:33:55.149 --> 03:33:56.530]  It just does better.
[03:33:56.870 --> 03:34:00.430]  Even when gold is doing good, silver does better.
[03:34:00.610 --> 03:34:05.430]  So we just get to take advantage of that and do the one thing that every single investor should do.
[03:34:06.220 --> 03:34:10.780]  Minimize risk, maximize return, be in the right place at the right time.
[03:34:11.260 --> 03:34:14.540]  See, to me, this is exciting times that we're living in.
[03:34:14.899 --> 03:34:30.909]  And when we have the wisdom and the knowledge and the discernment, like Alex was talking about at the beginning of the show, We are spiritual beings living in a physical body, and when we lack wisdom and discernment, you ask God the Father to give it to you,
[03:34:30.969 --> 03:34:34.569]  and James 1, 5 says He's going to give you more than what you ask for.
[03:34:34.770 --> 03:34:46.010]  And when there's so many competing voices, so much lies and misinformation and disinformation, And you've got people who are speaking truth and are being attacked for it, like Alex.
[03:34:46.370 --> 03:34:55.350]  We have to have wisdom on who we listen to, discernment to know who to understand and who to throw out the window, so to speak.
[03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:59.270]  And this is where truth is always truth.
[03:34:59.569 --> 03:35:01.209]  Light will cast out the darkness.
[03:35:01.409 --> 03:35:06.790]  And this is what we're trying to do in a world where complex financial systems are being established.
[03:35:07.629 --> 03:35:09.469]  To me, it boils down to two things.
[03:35:09.649 --> 03:35:18.610]  The monetary system has changed, like we just talked about philosophically, from barter to gold to paper to plastic to crypto.
[03:35:18.930 --> 03:35:32.170]  And in this new world, I think what is going to remain, what is going to remain as central banks fail around the world and fiat money creation fails is tangible assets like gold and silver and crypto.
[03:35:32.270 --> 03:35:32.590]  That's right.
[03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:33.389]  That's the roadmap.
[03:35:34.399 --> 03:35:34.719]  Dr.
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:36.500]  Kirk Elliott, everybody should call you.
[03:35:36.620 --> 03:35:40.360]  You are the top silver broker because you're not pushing gold, even though you will soon.
[03:35:40.700 --> 03:35:41.780]  You've called it all.
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:42.760]  You're a great sponsor.
[03:35:42.879 --> 03:35:43.879]  Highest ratings out there.
[03:35:44.020 --> 03:35:44.719]  Best prices.
[03:35:45.360 --> 03:35:47.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, give him a call right now.
[03:35:47.860 --> 03:35:48.920]  We'll put it back on screen.
[03:35:49.319 --> 03:35:51.620]  Everybody needs to visit your site.
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:53.100]  They need to sign up for a free consultation.
[03:35:53.260 --> 03:35:57.639]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[03:35:59.060 --> 03:36:03.079]  720-605-3900, KEPM.com, forward slash gold.
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:06.600]  And when you go to that part of the site, they know that we sent you and we get support.
[03:36:06.719 --> 03:36:09.180]  We wouldn't be able to be on the air without you at this critical time.
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:09.440]  Dr.
[03:36:09.559 --> 03:36:11.040]  Elliott, thank you so much and God bless.
[03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:12.420]  God bless.
[03:36:12.979 --> 03:36:13.360]  All right.
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:16.639]  I'm going to end the show in six, seven minutes.
[03:36:17.530 --> 03:36:19.690]  Owen Schroyer, back in the Infowar studios.
[03:36:19.690 --> 03:36:21.170]  We were supposedly shut down.
[03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:22.450]  The Onion supposedly bought us.
[03:36:22.489 --> 03:36:23.389]  It was supposedly an auction.
[03:36:23.950 --> 03:36:29.270]  I filed a major lawsuit today with all the documents of the open fraud.
[03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:32.030]  My lawyers never put in a document, this is fraud.
[03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:33.370]  They've never seen anything like it.
[03:36:33.450 --> 03:36:34.389]  It's cut and dry.
[03:36:34.649 --> 03:36:37.010]  Their own auction documents admitted it wasn't an auction.
[03:36:37.250 --> 03:36:38.149]  Everything else.
[03:36:38.729 --> 03:36:41.729]  And the folks that were the winning bid, they filed a major lawsuit.
[03:36:42.549 --> 03:36:43.030]  So...
[03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:47.469]  There's been so much World War III news, I haven't talked a lot about this, but here's the deal.
[03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:52.370]  The bad guys don't own KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:36:53.010 --> 03:36:55.450]  The bad guys don't own the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:36:56.049 --> 03:36:56.409]  Alright?
[03:36:57.549 --> 03:37:00.090]  That's our sponsor for the Alex Jones Network.
[03:37:00.829 --> 03:37:07.790]  If they do shut this down, which I don't think they're going to be able to do now, it's going to, the clearest move and the consensus is, by law, it has to go to the real highest bidder.
[03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:12.489]  The great patriots who are watching right now, say hi to Charlie, he's watching right now.
[03:37:12.920 --> 03:37:21.319]  So, go to thealexjonesstore.com and get incredible t-shirts, incredible supplements, and fund us in our lawsuits and our fight for you in the future.
[03:37:21.399 --> 03:37:23.059]  And let me just tell you right now what just came in.
[03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:24.379]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:37:25.159 --> 03:37:28.639]  Again, Elon Musk X Corp files notice in Alex Jones M4's bankruptcy.
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:29.760]  They asked for all the documents.
[03:37:29.860 --> 03:37:30.559]  They have to pay for those.
[03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:31.840]  Their lawyers were there.
[03:37:32.059 --> 03:37:34.579]  They have now entered the case in defense of free speech.
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:35.100]  Boom.
[03:37:35.860 --> 03:37:38.299]  Now, a bunch of new t-shirts came in.
[03:37:38.459 --> 03:37:40.399]  Bigly, that owns thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:37:41.490 --> 03:37:44.129]  Are amazing individuals.
[03:37:44.649 --> 03:37:46.709]  And they have put out hundreds of new designs.
[03:37:46.889 --> 03:37:49.870]  Trump won shirts, Alex Jones shirts, classic M4 shirts.
[03:37:50.010 --> 03:37:50.489]  It's all there.
[03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:53.229]  We are all Alex Jones.
[03:37:53.350 --> 03:37:55.110]  That famous photo that people memed.
[03:37:55.649 --> 03:37:57.250]  Let's put that back on screen if we can.
[03:37:57.569 --> 03:37:58.350]  I love it.
[03:37:58.469 --> 03:37:59.229]  Coming out of the tunnel.
[03:37:59.389 --> 03:38:00.389]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:38:00.549 --> 03:38:02.690]  That is a brand new shirt made right in Arkansas.
[03:38:03.190 --> 03:38:04.569]  It's in the mail to me right now.
[03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:05.149]  It'll be here tomorrow.
[03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:06.870]  You order it, it's ready to ship.
[03:38:07.889 --> 03:38:09.430]  That is an amazing shirt.
[03:38:09.889 --> 03:38:10.950]  And there's other ones.
[03:38:11.069 --> 03:38:11.409]  Look at this one.
[03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:12.969]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[03:38:14.090 --> 03:38:15.969]  That really explains what's in the water.
[03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:19.469]  A great topic that's now mainstream news that I first exposed decades ago.
[03:38:19.889 --> 03:38:20.530]  The Atrazine.
[03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:23.090]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:26.569]  Team Humanity that I launched with Elon Musk last year.
[03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:28.229]  That shirt is amazing.
[03:38:29.290 --> 03:38:30.569]  Oh, old Dale Gribble.
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:33.459]  Warns you about the government.
[03:38:33.860 --> 03:38:34.979]  Was right all the time.
[03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:36.379]  What an amazing shirt.
[03:38:36.979 --> 03:38:39.860]  They come out with the darkest hour shirt for InfoWars.
[03:38:40.079 --> 03:38:42.760]  It's all there with all the great Trump won shirts.
[03:38:42.979 --> 03:38:45.559]  And then, I'm wearing one of them right now.
[03:38:45.860 --> 03:38:48.239]  I love, I get so many compliments on this baby.
[03:38:49.180 --> 03:38:50.440]  Join or die.
[03:38:50.860 --> 03:38:52.280]  A modern Gadsden flag.
[03:38:52.639 --> 03:38:55.239]  The First and Second Amendment Defense League shirt.
[03:38:56.409 --> 03:38:58.790]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:38:58.790 --> 03:39:03.930]  And if you really want to support us, you know, the shirts cost, when they're extra, extra, extra large, like 17, 18 bucks.
[03:39:04.049 --> 03:39:05.129]  The smalls are like 15.
[03:39:05.229 --> 03:39:06.129]  These are high-quality shirts.
[03:39:07.020 --> 03:39:09.399]  We sell them for $25, $30, $35 depending on the shirt.
[03:39:09.860 --> 03:39:12.860]  I'm only making it up if the sponsor gets their half, you know, $6, $7.
[03:39:13.200 --> 03:39:14.700]  We have to sell a lot of shirts to fund ourselves.
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:16.280]  Well, guess what?
[03:39:16.479 --> 03:39:18.500]  And the supplements don't have a big markup, but they're amazing.
[03:39:18.620 --> 03:39:20.540]  Ultimate CMOS is the ultimate superfood.
[03:39:20.639 --> 03:39:21.219]  So incredible.
[03:39:22.079 --> 03:39:25.079]  Hydroforce isn't just the highest quality electrolytes, but all the vitamins and key minerals.
[03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:26.379]  It's all there.
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:27.819]  And so many other great supplements.
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:30.899]  But there are the fundraising t-shirts.
[03:39:31.979 --> 03:39:35.899]  There are a few of those in there that are $50, like the classic InfoWars shirt, red on navy blue.
[03:39:36.219 --> 03:39:37.739]  If you really want to get us some funds in.
[03:39:37.879 --> 03:39:40.299]  Or the limited edition posters.
[03:39:41.450 --> 03:39:43.170]  You hang on the wall, you know you support it.
[03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:44.409]  That's what it's all about.
[03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:45.670]  Can't do it without you.
[03:39:45.770 --> 03:39:46.450]  We're making history.
[03:39:46.629 --> 03:39:47.370]  Thanks for your support.
[03:39:47.709 --> 03:39:49.389]  We're suing the living hell out of these people.
[03:39:49.489 --> 03:39:50.350]  We got them on the run.
[03:39:50.569 --> 03:39:50.889]  Watch.
[03:39:51.290 --> 03:39:52.889]  Told you Thursday we'll be back in the building.
[03:39:52.989 --> 03:39:53.989]  I said probably by next Monday.
[03:39:54.129 --> 03:39:54.670]  It was the next day.
[03:39:54.909 --> 03:39:55.909]  It was a lie.
[03:39:55.909 --> 03:39:56.770]  It was a scam.
[03:39:56.930 --> 03:39:58.350]  It was an insane power grab.
[03:39:59.010 --> 03:40:00.809]  They were betting on this judge being corrupt.
[03:40:00.969 --> 03:40:02.770]  He was the one who said, hell no, this wasn't an auction.
[03:40:02.969 --> 03:40:04.930]  He was the one who said everyone should be deeply troubled by this.
[03:40:05.659 --> 03:40:10.200]  Also, everybody that buys products gets put in 10X to get the new super truck.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:15.540]  Friday, we've got the winner in studio and the other big super Dodge truck.
[03:40:16.780 --> 03:40:18.520]  That will be all announced on Friday.
[03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:19.540]  This is the new truck.
[03:40:20.180 --> 03:40:22.600]  So it's all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:40:22.719 --> 03:40:25.260]  Become a VIP for $30 a month.
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:26.620]  Cancel any time.
[03:40:26.799 --> 03:40:30.860]  You get special deals, special discounts on top of sales, special products only you can get.
[03:40:32.930 --> 03:40:34.629]  And $40 each month to spend.
[03:40:34.629 --> 03:40:35.809]  And that way you love the products.
[03:40:35.809 --> 03:40:36.350]  You get them.
[03:40:36.450 --> 03:40:40.030]  You get reminded as a VIP that your $40 comes in to spend in the store.
[03:40:40.030 --> 03:40:42.870]  If you're going to buy anything, you save money.

[03:40:45.250 --> 03:40:52.950]  Being a VIP, thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. So history's happening now.
[03:40:53.149 --> 03:40:54.389]  This is a war.
[03:40:54.569 --> 03:40:57.610]  We fund it with great products you're going to love.
[03:40:58.719 --> 03:41:00.180]  It's up to you to keep us on air.
[03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:01.780]  I am humbly asking you for your support.
[03:41:01.879 --> 03:41:02.879]  Have we not been faithful?
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:03.780]  Have we not been hardcore?
[03:41:04.159 --> 03:41:06.219]  Have we not been one of the top enemies of the globalists?
[03:41:06.579 --> 03:41:07.479]  We are in this together.
[03:41:07.639 --> 03:41:10.860]  You are the Paul Revere's with your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[03:41:11.079 --> 03:41:14.180]  And we make it easy at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:41:14.319 --> 03:41:15.020]  And finally...
[03:41:15.540 --> 03:41:22.120]  My dad, an amazing retired doctor, drjonesnaturals.com, he developed many of our proprietary supplements.
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:23.920]  He's a sponsor of Infowars.
[03:41:24.379 --> 03:41:25.719]  Hopefully we stay here.
[03:41:25.979 --> 03:41:28.920]  So they're a sponsor for Infowars.
[03:41:29.540 --> 03:41:30.760]  So is my dad.
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:34.520]  It's just they're also sponsoring the backup studios and systems.
[03:41:35.739 --> 03:41:39.079]  And my dad has committed basically everything coming into the operation.
[03:41:40.639 --> 03:41:42.579]  So has the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:41:42.659 --> 03:41:48.319]  In fact, they said a few weeks ago, we're going to forego much of our deal where they were getting half the money coming in.
[03:41:48.399 --> 03:41:50.440]  They said, we're just going to give you almost all of it, which they've done.
[03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:51.760]  Because they're Americans.
[03:41:51.940 --> 03:41:52.440]  They're patriots.
[03:41:52.479 --> 03:41:53.200]  They know it's a fight.
[03:41:53.440 --> 03:42:00.579]  When you go to DRJonesNaturals.com and get the incredible supplements that are over-the-top powerful, like Rocket Rest, incredible sleep, babe.
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:02.620]  So good for your whole body to get deep, restful sleep.
[03:42:02.899 --> 03:42:03.940]  Next Level Financial Energy.
[03:42:04.059 --> 03:42:06.860]  It's not a stimulant, but sure as hell feels like when I'm on it right now without any letdown.
[03:42:07.260 --> 03:42:09.020]  The product in this is just unbelievable.
[03:42:10.340 --> 03:42:16.600]  It is the breakdown that most people can't process of folic acid, methylfolate with other key ingredients.
[03:42:17.100 --> 03:42:19.379]  Next level, foundational energy is next level.
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:21.639]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:42:21.799 --> 03:42:23.319]  We fired the bat signal.
[03:42:24.159 --> 03:42:30.920]  Support our great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com and thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:30.959 --> 03:42:32.819]  Now I'm going to end this transmission in 30 seconds.
[03:42:33.729 --> 03:42:37.790]  In two minutes after I got a break, Owen Schroer is coming in.
[03:42:38.489 --> 03:42:41.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, you did this.
[03:42:41.729 --> 03:42:43.850]  The little stickers on the gas pump, Biden did this.
[03:42:43.950 --> 03:42:44.649]  Well, you did this.
[03:42:44.729 --> 03:42:45.510]  This is your victory.
[03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:52.500]  You back somebody that knows what's going on, that's got the most informative guests and a great, smart crew, who'll never back down.
[03:42:52.500 --> 03:42:53.940]  But you are our backers.
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:54.920]  You are the variable.
[03:42:55.139 --> 03:42:56.700]  You are the resistance.
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:57.700]  You are everything.
[03:42:57.700 --> 03:43:00.040]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[03:43:00.739 --> 03:43:03.600]  Owen Schroer from the M4 studios, coming up now.
[03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:07.290]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[03:43:07.569 --> 03:43:12.430]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[03:43:12.690 --> 03:43:14.250]  The latest case was last week.
[03:43:14.729 --> 03:43:16.090]  The judge shut them down.
[03:43:16.250 --> 03:43:17.149]  They were thrown out of the building.
[03:43:17.629 --> 03:43:18.489]  Crimes were committed.
[03:43:18.729 --> 03:43:20.370]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[03:43:20.590 --> 03:43:22.250]  I've filed counter lawsuits.
[03:43:22.590 --> 03:43:23.450]  You name it.
[03:43:24.420 --> 03:43:25.799]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[03:43:25.940 --> 03:43:27.579]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[03:43:28.319 --> 03:43:41.860]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[03:43:42.139 --> 03:43:45.840]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[03:43:45.860 --> 03:43:48.500]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[03:43:49.049 --> 03:43:54.750]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[03:43:54.750 --> 03:43:55.809]  I don't even own that.
[03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:56.610]  It's the sponsor.
[03:43:56.989 --> 03:44:10.030]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:44:10.209 --> 03:44:14.270]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[03:44:14.729 --> 03:44:19.370]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[03:44:19.569 --> 03:44:21.250]  The Onion does not own me.
[03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:24.690]  They do not own thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:44:25.049 --> 03:44:26.409]  So thanks for your past support.

[03:44:38.190 --> 03:44:41.530]  We are reaching 50, 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[03:44:41.770 --> 03:44:45.549]  We are kicking New World Order ass and they are fighting us.
[03:44:45.959 --> 03:44:47.760]  I can beat them, but not without your help.
[03:44:47.940 --> 03:44:50.680]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[03:44:50.719 --> 03:44:51.260]  I'm going to say it again.
[03:44:51.559 --> 03:44:53.020]  It's not owned by me.
[03:44:53.280 --> 03:44:54.879]  It's not owned by the Onion.
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:56.719]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[03:44:56.879 --> 03:45:04.719]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[03:45:04.879 --> 03:45:06.959]  It's thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:45:07.059 --> 03:45:09.139]  It's the future one way or another.

[03:45:20.809 --> 03:45:22.069]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.989]  We're fighting hard.
[03:45:23.209 --> 03:45:24.030]  We're winning.
[03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:25.829]  But the fight is close.
[03:45:25.989 --> 03:45:31.250]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
