[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.760]  It's Monday, December 23rd, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, and we've got some really serious news coming up now.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.679]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.780]  All right, it was not hard to do.
[00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.039]  All you got to do is study the globalists, and they telegraph their next moves.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.619]  And for any regular listener...
[00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:55.009]  Of the 50-60 million people that tune in every day, you know that I predicted exactly what would happen with the election.
[00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:12.010]  And then I laid out the different pre-programmed attacks the desperate globalist deep state would then launch to either stop Trump from getting in office or hand him such a disaster that it kills his laissez-faire,
[00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.129]  America first, populist, pro-human...
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760]  Movement instead of their post-industrial globalist de-industrialization plan.
[00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:33.079]  And I've laid all those out, and exactly as I said, they did it to a T. Again, it's not hard.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.120]  That is what is so frustrating about this.
[00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.260]  It's now all over the corporate news, and I'm going to be covering it later.
[00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.640]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.810]  Now Mike Benz is covering it and the Daily Wires filed lawsuits because they were targeted too.
[00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.270]  And Elon Musk is talking about it.
[00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.629]  Great!
[00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.629]  I told everybody eight plus years ago.
[00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.789]  I told Trump who was spying on him when he was president-elect.
[00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.729]  And I raised that just as another point.
[00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.430]  That people have to realize we're in an undeclared war.
[00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.689]  We're all being targeted.
[00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:38.409]  And once you understand that, then you can mobilize and stop it, because what the bad guys are doing is totally tyrannical, totalitarian, and illegal as hell.
[00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.610]  So, what's the big news here?
[00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.050]  Well, I told you all the different scenarios.
[00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.389]  Escalation of World War III, bombing of Russia as soon as Trump was president-elect.
[00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.469]  That happened like clockwork.
[00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.949]  That they would start hyping race war and say that they were going to have blue states and cities secede.
[00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:16.389]  I said they would declare a new pandemic and a national emergency starting in places like California and New York and then growing.
[00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.770]  That's now begun.
[00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.469]  That they would try to pull the rug out from the economy even worse to hand Trump a full disaster.
[00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:27.449]  That's going on.
[00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:39.080]  But Inside of the escalation into full nuclear war, we're already in World War III. I called that first as well.
[00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.639]  Then I said within 48 hours, I expect world leaders to say it.
[00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.039]  They did.
[00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.919]  Three weeks ago.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.139]  My point is, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.000]  So, here's the big development now.
[00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:58.620]  I said, and I've asked the archivist to find this, but any listeners heard me say it probably 200 times the last six months.
[00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.949]  That even when Trump wins, if the landslide's big enough, they can override the fraud.
[00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.789]  And then weeks before, I said it'll be such a giant landslide, it'll be a small landslide, because it'll mitigate a lot of the fraud, and it'll still make it over the blue seawall.
[00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:12.770]  The red wave will.
[00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.410]  So it looked like a moderate landslide, not a gigantor one, because of the fraud, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.329]  And I kept saying, they'll start bombing Russia immediately with attackums and storm shadows as soon as he is president-elect.
[00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.850]  That happened within a week and a half of him being president-elect.
[00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:40.670]  But I said, what you gotta really watch for is if they start saying Iran's gonna launch a nuclear sneak attack on Israel or the United States.
[00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.709]  And I said, if they start saying that, they're getting ready to do a nuclear false flag, they'll probably kill Trump.
[00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.430]  Probably kill two birds with one stone.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.519]  State Department came out, National Security Advisor Dick Sullivan today and said, oh my God, Iran's going to nuke us with no evidence.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.740]  This is a gigantic escalation with just, what, 29 days until Trump's in office?
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.660]  We're covering it all straight ahead.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.379]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now, now.
[00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:23.439]  All right, we are 27 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, 19 seconds until President Trump has inaugurated the 47th President of the United States with the greatest comeback in I mean,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.019]  this is as big a comeback as Julius Caesar after his 15-year exile in Germania.
[00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.139]  Nuclear war false flag alert.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:48.620]  To stop the incoming Trump administration, global peace initiative, the Biden White House is now hyping an Iranian nuclear sneak attack.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:06:01.139]  Now, I have been a broken record in the last six months that if they assassinate Trump, they would blame it on Iran.
[00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.199]  And then right after Butler happened, by the next day, they said, oh, we think it's Iran with no evidence.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.899]  Then they said, oh, three days later, oh, Iran is trying to kill him.
[00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:28.000]  And I predicted that before they did it because it's so obvious that And then I said they're going to claim Iran has smuggled service-to-air missiles in the United States so they can shoot down Trump Force One.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.579]  And then it came out that, oh my gosh, eight missiles got smuggled across Texas, Iran.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.500]  Iran is being framed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:45.319]  And then Trump walked right into the trap saying, well, if I am killed by Iran, blow Iran off the map.
[00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.100]  And I'm like, you're walking into their trap, you're begging the deep state to kill you and blame Iran.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.639]  And Trump did stop saying it at that point.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:21.990]  And I have told you hundreds of times before the election and in the last month and a half since the election, over and over again, That if you start seeing hype that Iran may have smuggled a nuke into range of Israel or into the United States or into Europe And then you start seeing hype about how they're looking for radiological material,
[00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:23.430]  which we've been hearing a bunch.
[00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.029]  What did I say last week and two weeks ago?
[00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:32.250]  I said, this may be pre-hyping for a nuclear false flag attack tied to Iran.
[00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:49.300]  And I said last week, the week before, I said, if they start saying they think Iran may have smuggled a nuke in, they're pre-programming imminently a nuclear false flag to attack Iran and And to hand Trump a full World War III nuclear war scenario.
[00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.639]  And that they would do it right before he gets into office.
[00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:03.259]  And now all those pieces of the recipe are on the table.
[00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.480]  You come home after school at 4 o'clock.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920]  Mom's in the kitchen.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.240]  She's got a pot roast out.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.180]  She's putting seasoning on it.
[00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.259]  She's got a big pot ready.
[00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.139]  She's turned the oven on.
[00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.879]  She's chopping up carrots and onions and garlic and celery.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.860]  And you know, oh, we're having pot roast tonight.
[00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.339]  So people ask how I know this stuff.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.879]  It's on the frickin' table.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.879]  Ding dong.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.320]  Oh, mom, you're not cooking tonight?
[00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.179]  No, I ordered pizza.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.220]  You can see the pizza man at the delivery door.
[00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:37.100]  This is not hard.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.320]  So this is horrible news.
[00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.740]  And I'm going to go over it right now.
[00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:48.220]  Now, exposing it can stop it.
[00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:59.740]  But the reason I, when I start telling you something new, will kind of remind you of a few of the things, just a few of the things I said that were dead on.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.779]  I could go on for hours, and it's because my head is in the game.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.320]  This is what I do.
[00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.360]  But it's not like some complex trigonometry equation.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.320]  It's right there.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.820]  And I know you get that as well.
[00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:26.250]  So, we have massive news, incredible information on so many fronts to hit, and I'm loaded for bear.
[00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.710]  And so I will get to all of this news today.
[00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:45.620]  But my job is to be front and center with what the bad guys are planning next, and watching what they're up to, and understanding their past behavior, And they don't even really hide this stuff.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:10:04.299]  It's like I've been saying the last few years, even when Trump wins re-election, and I believe he will be, and I believe he will override the fraud, and then when he got his daughter-in-law as the head of the RNC, actually got the hundreds of millions it took to put the poll watchers and lawyers on scene at all the key battleground counties,
[00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:07.299]  I said, they're going to mitigate the fraud.
[00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:08.360]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.759]  It didn't happen.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.559]  And I said, once he's president-elect, they will start bombing Russia, the United States, through NATO, with attack and storm shadows and other heavy missiles to try to escalate.
[00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.740]  And it happened like clockwork.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:41.059]  And then I said, if they start hyping that Iran is going to launch a nuclear attack on Israel or the United States or smuggle a weapon in, or both,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:52.320]  That is the major red flag flashing lights that they are preparing to do a false flag and blame Iran.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.879]  Then they get their entire agenda.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.320]  Full war.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.200]  Iran has a defense pact with China, North Korea, and Russia.
[00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.679]  And that will bring them fully into war.
[00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:11.139]  And just like we said months and months ago, I said...
[00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:23.470]  Look for, once President Trump was president-elect, for Israel to start taking out Iranian forces in the Middle East, which happened, and bombing Iran proper.
[00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.269]  And of course that happened.
[00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.970]  I mean, this is so simple.
[00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.269]  And so that's why I'm really, really, really concerned.
[00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.350]  And I'm going to focus on the details of this here in a moment, the new developments.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:58.360]  But because the world's awakening, because populist anti-globalists are winning almost every election everywhere across the world, and because the Great Awakening is just crescendoing into just explosive new success, and because the entire globalist agenda on every front is falling apart,
[00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:02.139]  these guys aren't going to give up.
[00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.049]  And the big move is total war.
[00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.970]  Behind that is a new pandemic or pandemics, plandemics.
[00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.669]  That's already in motion.
[00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:17.649]  Coups, domestic civil unrest, all of it.
[00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:28.570]  And of course, Trump came out last night in a big speech that he gave and said, there's almost zero time to prevent a nuclear war.
[00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:31.629]  We've got excerpts of that speech coming up.
[00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:39.450]  And that was going to be my full focus in the first hour today, the positiveness of that and saying, look out though, the bad guys are going to try to escalate.
[00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:45.129]  And then I'm sitting here going through the news stacks and I go, holy Toledo, AP Reuters.
[00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:53.149]  Well, here's the press release from the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and the Secretary of State Blinken.
[00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:54.330]  He made a similar statement.
[00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.250]  We have video of that.
[00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:09.360]  That Trump's facing a nuclear war with Iran, and Iran, while they've got chatter, is going to hit Israel or the United States with a nuke because they're losing.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:24.700]  Well, if Iran thinks they're losing now, and Israel has done an amazing job, whether you love Israel or hate Israel or neutral on it, at smashing Hezbollah in Lebanon,
[00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:47.850]  in Syria, you name it, But the idea that Iran would then nuke Israel or that Iran would nuke the United States and guarantee to turn almost all of Iran into a glass parking lot is preposterous.
[00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.269]  And the mullahs have said that.
[00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.710]  They said, we don't want this.
[00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.909]  They've been in hiding.
[00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.610]  They've been saying, we don't want to assassinate Trump.
[00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:00.139]  They've been saying, if that happens, it's not us.
[00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.639]  Why would we want to go to full war with you?
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:13.720]  So, there is zero evidence Iran is going to nuke us, or Israel.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.820]  Past Mullahs and Ahmadinejad did shoot their mouths off.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.799]  He was removed a long time ago.
[00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:21.720]  You haven't heard that.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.519]  We're going to nuke you talk in a long time.
[00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:33.100]  So, Iran's bravata has been not stunted.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.440]  They haven't been given a bloody nose.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.539]  They have had their ass beaten to the ground.
[00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:39.899]  They are a pile of broken bones.
[00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:43.799]  They have had their ass kicked up and down the street.
[00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:57.580]  Now, we've been hearing for 23 years from Benjamin Netanyahu, when he's in and out of office over there, in front of the UN, in front of Congress, that Iran is two weeks from a nuke.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.600]  That's for 23 years.
[00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.659]  You want to see a 23-year clip?
[00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.179]  And he came here right after 9-11 and said it.
[00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.259]  Tried to get us to go to war with Iran.
[00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.240]  Tried to blame 9-11 on Iran.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.700]  Instead, they blamed it on Iraq.
[00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:10.820]  All pure crap.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.860]  It's all been declassified.
[00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.490]  Serious war crimes.
[00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.789]  And then Trump making joke videos at the National Press Club about no WMDs under here, no WMDs over there.
[00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.769]  It's all so funny.
[00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:25.110]  The sanctions killed millions of Iraqis.
[00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:30.409]  How would you like not having any medicine or stuff for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years?
[00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.070]  That's what the West did to them.
[00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.370]  Totally evil.
[00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.990]  And then the globalists opened the borders up and ship all the refugees that are pissed off here.
[00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:41.110]  See how the New World Order operates?
[00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:49.450]  They shut the third world down for three, four years with COVID lockdowns, way worse than ours, and then they flood up here, and then they destroy us with the illegal aliens.
[00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:52.509]  See how it works?
[00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:02.669]  So, this goes on and on and on.
[00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:32.919]  So, The fact that they've got the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor coming out and making their main focus means they are strongly considering setting off the nuke or giving it to crazies.
[00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:48.549]  And I even said on July 15th, two days before, the exact story was put out by CNN and the FBI. I said, well, I already said before they tried to kill Trump, but I said, they'll try to blame Iran first.
[00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.629]  And then they did.
[00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:55.370]  And then nobody bought that, so they shut up on July 14th the next day about it.
[00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.649]  They push it for one day.
[00:16:57.409 --> 00:17:13.269]  And I said, watch, now they'll claim there's new teams trying to kill Trump, and they'll turn out to be run by the FBI and the CIA. And then weeks later, and another month later, they bust different groups of Afghans and Pakistanis who thought they were working for Al-Qaeda and Iran,
[00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:21.529]  but were being paid by these intelligence agencies through their Islamic operatives to try to come here and kill Trump.
[00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:27.569]  But then there were whistleblowers inside the agency, so another arm of the agency's rolled them up.
[00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.589]  So, this is where we are.
[00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:44.509]  And so they're trying to hold Trump's policies hostage by Blinken saying, well, Trump, you need to go shake the way we say with Iran, or they're going to get desperate and launch a nuclear attack.
[00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:58.940]  So it sounds like they're trying to stop it, and in warning that Iran could do this, But the real move is to put that out there like they're trying to stop it, and then it's up to him to stop it so that when it happens, even though he's not in administration yet, it's his fault.
[00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.960]  See how that twisted psychological warfare works?
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.019]  It's not like I'm just looking at this now and saying that's what it is.
[00:18:06.099 --> 00:18:08.079]  I told you before they did it, they'd do this.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.559]  It's not like I take what they say and just, oh, spin it.
[00:18:11.619 --> 00:18:13.519]  No, I told you over and over again before.
[00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:17.650]  I want the archivist to find it.
[00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.910]  Most of you are like, we know, we've heard it a hundred times.
[00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.329]  The point is, it's important to play.
[00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:26.250]  So, here's the London Telegraph headline.
[00:18:26.869 --> 00:18:30.849]  Weakened Iran could hit back with a nuclear bomb, Trump told by White House.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:39.720]  Iran's position has weakened following Israel's strikes on its proxies, Palestine, Hamas, Lebanon, Hezbollah, and the fall of Bashar al-Assad.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:48.539]  The Iran-aligned Syrian president, Mr. Sullivan, warned that there was an increased risk that Iran might abandon its promise not to build nuclear weapons.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.559]  Oh, come on.
[00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.589]  It's a risk we are trying to be vigilant about now.
[00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:57.289]  It's a risk that I'm personally briefing incoming team on.
[00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.230]  Solomon said, adding that he had also consulted with U.S. ally Israel.
[00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:10.630]  Well, you don't think desperate Netanyahu facing prison in a criminal trial right now wouldn't a green light?
[00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.109]  Wouldn't be part of something like that?
[00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:15.230]  Make the USS Liberty look like...
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.200]  One on a Richter scale compared to a thousand on a Richter scale.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:33.619]  However, the president-elect and his team have been assessing Iran's diminished regional position and are now considering airstrikes on nuclear facilities, the Wall Street Journal reports.
[00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:42.180]  It would mark a breach of the long-standing U.S. foreign policy of containing Tehran with diplomacy and sanctions.
[00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:45.700]  Yeah, do you think Iran has its...
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.119]  Atomic bombs, which of course they've got.
[00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:55.900]  In those obvious bases, no.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:05.720]  Mr. Trump has told Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel Prime Minister in recent calls is concerned about Iran achieving nuclear capability.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.000]  The journal reported.
[00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.259]  Does Trump not know Iran already has nuclear weapons?
[00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:12.440]  God help us.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:27.549]  So, Here's a clip of Blinken, and then I'm going to shift gears into Trump's speech last night on the fact that we've never been closer to nuclear war, which is damn accurate.
[00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:39.849]  And he wants that war over yesterday, and he's got the funding already pretty much cut, even though he's not in office yet, putting pressure on Johnson, Speaker Johnson.
[00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.690]  So...
[00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:53.329]  Trump is right on Ukraine and wrong on his bullishness on Iran.
[00:20:53.329 --> 00:20:54.789]  And I know what's going on.
[00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.089]  Trump understands the rhetoric, just like he did with Rocketman, Kim Jong-un.
[00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.190]  We'll bring him to the table.
[00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:01.609]  I mean, I understand what he's doing.
[00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:08.569]  But there's the danger of the outgoing administration setting off a damn nuke.
[00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.349]  Or killing you, Mr. President, and blaming it on Iran.
[00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:13.849]  That way they get their cake and eat it too.
[00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:17.289]  Please think second, third order.
[00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.549]  And I know you do.
[00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:20.750]  Sometimes.
[00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.049]  So, that's where we are.
[00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.049]  Here is the Secretary of State.
[00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:37.109]  We are meeting at this historic moment where there have been tectonic shifts around the world.
[00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:52.529]  As someone who initially grew up on the Upper East Side, not far from here, who went to private schools, then spent a lot of time in Europe, wound up in the Ivy League, and I'm now in this job, well, only in America.
[00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:58.490]  Get you a microphone here, coming in your direction.
[00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.930]  Stay seated if you like.
[00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:03.609]  A little bit more stable, a little bit more predictable.
[00:22:04.329 --> 00:22:08.470]  President Biden, President Putin met in Geneva, had a lengthy meeting.
[00:22:08.589 --> 00:22:12.049]  This is well before the council and to spend some time with us today.
[00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.130]  We're very grateful for your service.
[00:22:14.349 --> 00:22:14.750]  Thank you.
[00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.430]  Thank you, Mike.
[00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:28.769]  From administration to administration, whether it's ours, whether it's the Trump administration, whether it was the Obama administration, There's been a shared determination and a shared determination that remains to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.
[00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:36.170]  One way or another, I'm convinced that just as our administration had that policy, the next administration will.
[00:22:37.829 --> 00:22:39.069]  That's a weird clip.
[00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:54.910]  It just shows what a bumbling weirdo Blinken, is there a bunch of Ivy League scum who can't skin a buck, run a trot line, change a tire, pretty much wipe their own butts, and they've just been handed the American power generationally,
[00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:57.769]  like Blinken, and they're just buffoons.
[00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.930]  But they're willing to do some nasty stuff and don't think they won't because their whole agenda is crashing down.
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:15.500]  Now, Trump speaking at TPUSA Turning Point event, Said, we've never been closer to nuclear war.
[00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:17.900]  We've got to end this thing now.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.019]  And he'll meet with Putin as soon as he can.
[00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:43.779]  You have to understand, for at least, almost three years, since the war escalated in late February, three years ago, three years in February coming up, Biden has not talked to anybody in Russia.
[00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:49.319]  And the hotline that's really a video interface system has just been turned off.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.880]  They don't talk to the Russians.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.900]  Oh, but Milley was talking to the Chinese on January 6th saying, don't worry, I've got the nuclear football, we're in control, there's been a coup.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.480]  So you can talk to your bosses over there, but you don't talk to the Russians, the biggest nuclear power in the world.
[00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:05.619]  It's beyond crazy.
[00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:11.920]  Donald Trump, President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.819]  We have to end the war.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:19.880]  Yes, this is why we elected President Trump here is...
[00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:22.720]  Club five.
[00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:27.900]  President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible.
[00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.240]  So we have to wait for this, but we have to end that war.
[00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:38.599]  That war is a horrible, horrible, that the soldiers, the number of soldiers being killed, it's a flat plane.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.279]  And the bullets are going and there's powerful bullets, powerful guns.
[00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.329]  And the only thing that's going to stop them is the human body.
[00:24:47.829 --> 00:24:50.289]  They go dead flat land.
[00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.630]  Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
[00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.890]  Millions of soldiers have died now.
[00:24:56.289 --> 00:24:56.730]  Millions.
[00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:04.089]  That's interesting because, you know, Trump said it's close to a million a month and a half ago, but now he's been given briefings.
[00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.630]  Millions.
[00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:06.430]  Over a million.
[00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:09.119]  Plural, and that's the info I've got.
[00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:11.299]  I mean, this is World War II level courage.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:24.200]  This is war with Russia, fully backed by NATO. Now, remember one of the main leaders in Europe speaking out against this escalation was Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.519]  And remember, he got shot a whole bunch of times.
[00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:33.440]  Some reports say seven, some four, some five.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:42.019]  But he got shot by a pro-Ukraine war lunatic, and it's got CIA written all over it.
[00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:44.039]  But he survived.
[00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:47.680]  Well, now that he survived, it took him months to the hospital, and he's back.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:56.099]  He's been explaining what really happened, and the fact that they tried to bribe him personally to get behind the war.
[00:25:56.259 --> 00:25:57.920]  So he didn't take the money, so they gave him bullets.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.380]  Here it is.
[00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:11.329]  Preto by som ani nemal dôvod reagovať na pána prezidenta Zelenského, ale dal mi v podstate šancu, aby som potvrdil, že hovorím to isté za zatvorenými dverami a to isté hovorím pred médiami.
[00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:22.650]  Nepôjdem teraz do citácie, to by nebolo korektné, čo všetko dnes pán prezident Zelenský povedal, aké ponuky mi podával, pretože by ste sa asi dosť čudovali, kde sa nachádzame, v akom prostredí.
[00:26:24.069 --> 00:26:27.710]  Začnem tým a poviem to verejne, aby to bolo každému úplne jasné.
[00:26:29.069 --> 00:26:31.049]  Slovensko nie je v žiadnej vojne.
[00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:36.170]  Ani s Ruskou federáciou, ani s Ukrajinou.
[00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.470]  Je nám veľmi ľúto, čo sa momentálne na Ukrajine deje.
[00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:48.589]  Viete, že od prvého dňa sme označili vpád vojsk na územie Ukrajiny ako porušenie medzinárodného práva.
[00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.490]  My neveríme vo vojenské riešenie.
[00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.170]  Odmietame darovať akékoľvek zbranie Ukrajine.
[00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:55.710]  Máme na mnohé veci iný názor.
[00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:59.740]  But it doesn't mean that anyone will be in the war.
[00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:03.839]  It doesn't mean that anyone will be in the war.
[00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:05.200]  It doesn't mean that anyone will be in the war.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.119]  We're good to go.
[00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:36.509]  Kto je priateľom Mieru, je priateľom agresora.
[00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:42.529]  Dámy a páni, musím to povedať, pán prezident Zelenský absolútne odmieta akékoľvek primerie.
[00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:44.190]  Akékoľvek primerie.
[00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:51.750]  Stále má nejakú predstavu, že najskôr snáď musí dostať všetko na svete a až potom sa bude baviť o nejakom primeri.
[00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:58.930]  A pri tom druhým dychom všetci hovoríme, aké obrovské straty ľudských životov sprevázajú tento vojnový konflikt.
[00:27:59.109 --> 00:28:06.490]  Ďalšou témou, kde bol veľký názorový rozdiel, It was my second question.
[00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:28.460]  I think that Ukraine would be different than the Russian Plymouth.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:46.779]  I was surprised by the fact that Ukraine would be different than the Russian Plymouth, because it would be a Russian Plymouth.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:59.720]  A prišiel s návrhmi, ktoré sa mi zda byť absurdné, napríklad, že on s tým bude súhlasiť len vtedy, ak nebudeme platiť až do konca vojny, na ktorý hlupák nám dá plyn zadarmo.
[00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:15.440]  Keď už sme sa blížili ku koncu, tak sa vrátil pán prezident k téme plynu a spýtal sa ma, že či teda by som hlasoval za členstvo v NATO, ak by mi on dal 500 miliónov eur z ruských aktív.
[00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:18.299]  Tak som samozrejme rovno odpovedal, že nikdy.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.059]  All right, and I just wanted to show you that clip.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.240]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.440]  It's a three-and-a-half-minute clip.
[00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:37.920]  We'll add it in post.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.259]  We're not a live show today.
[00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:41.660]  We post this on X and at Bandot Video.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.000]  But...
[00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.970]  We're glad he survived.
[00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:51.750]  That was not lucky for the attempted killer and the people backing him, but it was a blessing to Prime Minister Pico.
[00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:53.369]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:29:54.349 --> 00:30:09.369]  I am going to come back and talk about what I think Trump should do with Iran and not lay the groundwork to just beg the globals to do a nuclear false flag to stop our entire agenda of having a pro-human, prosperous Secure future.
[00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.250]  And then I'm going to hit all the other news.
[00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:12.769]  And there is a ton of it.
[00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:14.170]  It is crazy.

[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.200]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though it was over.
[00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:59.619]  The judge said you're actually going to sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:02.680]  We're going to work on that with outside groups that won't censor us.
[00:32:02.839 --> 00:32:05.420]  But who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are going to do.
[00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:08.019]  But regardless, we continue on.

[00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:55.859]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, December 23rd transmission.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:11.220]  The issue with the outgoing Biden administration hyping up that Iran's going to launch a secret sneak attack with nuclear weapons on Israel and the United States is very troubling.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.640]  And I've predicted that if they started doing that, you know we got big problems.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:25.259]  And I know what Trump needs to do, and I know what Iran needs to do, but that's going to take a few minutes, so I'm going to get to that start of the next hour.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:34.180]  And then later we'll take that clip and put it on the last 30 minutes I just covered and put that out as a report so you can share it.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.140]  Let me tell you some of what's coming up today.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.099]  We have...
[00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:56.960]  Massive concerted efforts by the deep state here, the UK government, the EU government and others, the Brazilian government, you name it, to try to take down Elon Musk.
[00:33:57.059 --> 00:33:57.859]  That means take us down.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.240]  Big developments on that front.
[00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:07.180]  Musk openly getting involved in all these tyrannical countries like Germany, going after their globalist controllers.
[00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:09.619]  We've got some big developments there.
[00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:21.000]  We've got huge developments on the incoming Trump administration and some of the things he's announced and done, not just his continued commitment and work to stop World War III, but amazing things in the economy.
[00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:26.940]  Bill Gates is openly announcing some new really evil stuff.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.579]  Also, the UN amplifies campaign against, quote, disinformation.
[00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:35.480]  That means the free press and AI through global governance, global government announcement.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:44.219]  We have just got so much that we're going to be getting in today, getting into.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:58.019]  Also, big studies out on Ozempic and how it causes loss of eyesight permanently, destroys your eyesight, and causes turbo cancer and more.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.739]  And that just illustrates how evil Big Pharma is and how they're getting worse every day.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.539]  We'll be going over that study and more.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.219]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. couldn't be the head of HHS soon enough.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:22.639]  But I wanted to focus on two big stories that captivated the world's attention over the weekend, and they should, because they're not just terrible tragedies.
[00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:27.920]  They also illustrate how sick the corporate media is and how they really are the enemy of the people.
[00:35:29.059 --> 00:35:38.280]  And of course, I'm talking about the German attack at the Christmas festival that killed and wounded a bunch of people.
[00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:42.500]  By one of these illegal aliens being protected by the German government.
[00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:44.260]  Now the media said it was a car attack.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.219]  And that dovetails...
[00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:52.360]  They're also blaming me and Elon Musk.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.980]  The largest publication in Germany, Der Spiegel.
[00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:56.400]  You can't make that up.
[00:35:56.539 --> 00:35:59.460]  Not trying to be gonzo journalists like Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.500]  I just always seem to be in the middle of it.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.420]  And then we've got the Guatemalan illegal alien...
[00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:16.630]  Pouring gasoline all over a woman and just murdering her for fun and watching her burn up like a Roman candle.
[00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:20.769]  That's where we get the term Roman candle.
[00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:27.170]  They would douse the Christians with oil and light them in fire as torches for nighttime gladiatorial events.
[00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.730]  So the great Nick Sordor, how about you are the media?
[00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:37.590]  He's a great journalist out there covering events the media wouldn't cover like the derailments, chemical spills, you name it.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.239]  And of course, recently what happened in North Carolina and more.
[00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:45.400]  And Elon Musk has been linking to him on a daily basis.
[00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:47.320]  He's reaching hundreds of millions of people a day.
[00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:50.159]  Boy, that's got to make the fake media, the corporate media, jealous.
[00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:53.500]  We're really honored to count him as a friend and a source.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:03.599]  And he was the first to ferret out that this was an illegal alien in New York that murdered this woman over the weekend on the subway train for no reason.
[00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:07.559]  And to confront AOC. He's busy.
[00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:12.760]  And she refused to talk about it and still blaming Daniel Penny for the crime.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.340]  Just saying, crime's up because of him.
[00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:16.599]  No, we need more Daniel Pennys.
[00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:20.219]  If he'd have been there, he would have stopped this guy while he was pouring the gasoline on her.
[00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:25.400]  And then you've got the media saying it was just a woman spontaneously combusted.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.059]  New York Daily News, you name it.
[00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.980]  After it was well known, the guy's name, who he was, what happened.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.719]  Covering it up.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:43.900]  So, simply, Simply stunning information.
[00:37:45.449 --> 00:37:49.449]  So we're going to go over all of this right now with Nick Sorter.
[00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:57.969]  Everybody should be following him on X. Obviously, very, very important to do that.
[00:37:58.489 --> 00:38:00.869]  Nick, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.409]  A lot of people already know the details, but it's important, I think, to walk through it.
[00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.989]  Again, not just her tragic death, but the entire response.
[00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:10.789]  And then you've got Alvin Braggs.
[00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.530]  Prosecutor getting attacked by Venezuelan gangs that he denied existed.
[00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:23.250]  And you've got Trump being vindicated as they arrest 14 of the very Venezuelan gang he talked about in Denver, home invasions, kidnappings.
[00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:27.289]  I mean, this is just absolutely out of control.
[00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.269]  So, Nick, thank you.
[00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:30.889]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:35.630]  Nick, do me a favor.
[00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.610]  Unmute your mic, please.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.480]  Yeah, that would help a little bit.
[00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.199]  You know, Alex, I appreciate you having me here.
[00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:44.519]  And look, we've been saying this for years.
[00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:46.840]  We've been saying that it was going to come to this for years.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:54.860]  Now we're at the stage where illegals from Guatemala are setting fire to innocent women in subway cars.
[00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:57.980]  I mean, this is just absolutely insane.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:13.559]  And you know, I don't know if you saw this, Alex, but just a couple of hours after this happened, before it was really hitting the mainstream news, You still had Governor Kathy Hochul posting on X saying how safe the subways were now.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:24.219]  I mean, just like, I don't know if these people were out of touch or if they were going to try to cover this up and just hope that it wouldn't get out, besides just in the New York City area and maybe the local media.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.260]  I don't know what the point of doing that was, but it made her look like an absolute fool.
[00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.239]  And, you know...
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:41.000]  You saw the headlines that said a woman catches fire on the subway in New York City when she spontaneously combusted or something.
[00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:46.000]  I mean, we've got other problems if women are spontaneously combusting on subways.
[00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:52.000]  They said a similar thing the other day when that terrorist attack happened in Germany.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.440]  They said a car ran into a crowd of people out there.
[00:39:55.539 --> 00:40:05.650]  So you have inanimate You have an animal objects deciding that they're going to go run into crowds and mow a bunch of people down in Germany and women spontaneously combusting on subways.
[00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:08.309]  You don't hate the mainstream media enough, Alex.
[00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.289]  And that's why nobody trusts them anymore.
[00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:17.250]  That's why so many people get their news from us, you know, me and other people on X, as well as you here on Infowars.
[00:40:18.769 --> 00:40:22.230]  Tell us about running into AOC and then we'll play the clip in a moment.
[00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:29.550]  Yeah, and so AOC is not used to getting any pushback at the Capitol.
[00:40:29.769 --> 00:40:34.269]  You know, all those reporters there that are on Capitol Hill, most of them are very, very friendly to her.
[00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:39.550]  You know, they basically ask her, oh my gosh, what color are your nails going to be next week or something stupid like that.
[00:40:39.789 --> 00:40:45.670]  She didn't expect to get a tough question while walking through the halls of Congress there.
[00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.369]  And so that's exactly what I did.
[00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.989]  You know, and honestly, it shouldn't have been that tough of a question.
[00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.469]  I'm asking why.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:02.739]  She hasn't condemned the Biden migrant crisis because it's literally causing the deaths of innocent constituents of hers.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:10.380]  Keep in mind, she is the congresswoman from New York City, which is exactly where this issue happened yesterday.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.280]  And instead of even attempting to answer the question, she tried to evade me.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:22.760]  She had her chief of staff literally assaulting me, trying to drag me back so that I couldn't follow her up the stairs.
[00:41:23.779 --> 00:41:26.280]  And then she falsely accused me of assault.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.400]  I mean, it's just absolutely wild.
[00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:31.159]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:31.840]  Here it is.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:39.480]  Cortez, your district is really suffering under the pressure of the border crisis.
[00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:42.000]  Why are...
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.300]  Don't touch me.
[00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:50.739]  Your district is very much suffering through the border crisis.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.360]  Why will you not...
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.880]  No, you're out of my way.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.780]  Get out of my way.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.860]  Dude, fucking get your hands off of me.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.400]  What?
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:17.280]  Are you talking to the Biden administration about fixing the border?
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.260]  Get off of me.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.440]  What is wrong with you?
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.199]  I did not touch you.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:23.920]  I have an old video.
[00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:28.710]  Meanwhile, we have the club server.
[00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.150]  Do people really want to hear more from her?
[00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:31.769]  I guess we can play it again.
[00:42:31.909 --> 00:42:32.510]  We played it last.
[00:42:32.929 --> 00:42:36.849]  Blaming the crime on people like Daniel Penny.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:48.199]  When, quote, vigilantism is almost non-existent, this wasn't even vigilantism, you have a right to defend yourself when somebody's screaming and pushing people and threatening to kill you.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.860]  When someone is in your face saying, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm serious, I go to prison all the time.
[00:42:53.019 --> 00:42:56.639]  He had hundreds of arrests, dozens of convictions, a complete maniac.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:01.320]  The black people on the train were also trying to stop him, thanked Daniel Penney.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.380]  I mean, we already know that.
[00:43:02.869 --> 00:43:09.849]  But the fact that Alvin Bragg threw the book at him, and that now she's doing this, these people are beyond disgusting.
[00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.110]  Why do you think they always side with the criminals?
[00:43:13.929 --> 00:43:14.949]  I don't really know.
[00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:27.230]  I mean, I know New York, they have to keep these people around because they're losing so many people in New York that you do have these politicians that are trying to import more of these people.
[00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:29.710]  They need bodies in New York for whatever reason.
[00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:31.690]  That's one of the reasons.
[00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:36.769]  I saw the statistics that New York's population would have dropped by a significant amount.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.639]  If they weren't importing these illegals.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:52.900]  So, I mean, the replacement theories that we talked about in the past, where they're literally just trying to replace us, I mean, it seems to be pretty much proven at this point.
[00:43:53.039 --> 00:43:56.079]  But, Alex, when it comes to Daniel Penny and...
[00:43:56.719 --> 00:44:04.280]  What he did and how he could have possibly stopped something like this or if people weren't afraid to intervene anymore.
[00:44:04.519 --> 00:44:07.079]  You look at other people that were on that subway car.
[00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:14.579]  There were other people on that subway car that probably would have intervened or at least apprehended the guy afterward.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.800]  But instead, everybody just watched him.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.300]  Everybody just sat and stared.
[00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:39.510]  We're good to go.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.619]  And so I can't blame people for not wanting to intervene in New York City.
[00:44:43.739 --> 00:44:46.219]  My advice is get out of these liberal cities.
[00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:48.940]  They're not going to get better anytime soon.
[00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.860]  Honestly, they may even just get worse.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:59.199]  They're going to spend the next four years trying to fight Trump on deporting these violent criminals like this Guatemalan illegal.
[00:45:01.039 --> 00:45:05.219]  Well, I've been to New York for events quite a bit, and I like the city overall.
[00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:07.119]  It has a lot of cool things, a lot of cool people.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:14.000]  It doesn't have a vibe that makes me physically want to run out of it, like L.A. or San Francisco or Seattle.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.559]  It doesn't really have that satanic vibe.
[00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:21.360]  I was even back there a few years ago, but it still has a scary vibe, and it's getting worse.
[00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:23.360]  But I've been on the subways a lot.
[00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:47.670]  Over the years and I've been messed with repeatedly because I'm white even though I was there with big guys and I'm not small but Rob is really big and some of the crew repeatedly we were messed with and again I mean imagine if you were black people on a subway and white people started saying you know what's your problems?
[00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.449]  What are you doing here?
[00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.750]  And most of the black folks by the way in New York are very nice.
[00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:59.889]  I just have to be honest It's probably four or five times that I've been on the subway out of maybe 15 times, especially if it's at night.
[00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.829]  Groups of black males.
[00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.349]  One time, older black males.
[00:46:03.429 --> 00:46:03.849]  I was shocked.
[00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:05.309]  This guy had gray hair, big guy.
[00:46:05.769 --> 00:46:08.110]  And he was literally trying to start a fight with us.
[00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.530]  And one of our camera guys that was little actually went up and pushed him back.
[00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.110]  That guy was from New York.
[00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:20.429]  And that was a little Rob, but it was just, it's shocking to see that type of crazy racial behavior.
[00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:30.630]  Do we have any idea about this, the Guatemalan illegal alien lunatic, just any motive here of why he just torched a homeless woman for no reason?
[00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:35.530]  No, I mean, this is the kind of stuff it seems like they do in third world countries.
[00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.269]  I mean, we don't know of any motive.
[00:46:37.269 --> 00:46:43.670]  I can't imagine there being a legitimate or even fathomable motive to this.
[00:46:43.789 --> 00:46:48.389]  I mean, you had a woman with a walker that was sleeping on the subway car.
[00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:51.130]  Sleeping on the subway car, not bothering anybody.
[00:46:51.489 --> 00:46:54.909]  It's a total annoying when people are sleeping in subway cars, but you don't set them on fire.
[00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.409]  That's not a very good motive, I would say there.
[00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.690]  And she hasn't been identified yet.
[00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.469]  She did have a walker.
[00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:12.940]  You know, there's that horrifying video of her just standing there on fire with nobody intervening, nobody seeming to try to put the fire out.
[00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:14.739]  There are fire extinguishers all over the place.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.920]  I don't know why nobody bothered trying to put the fire out.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:27.539]  And, you know, in the video, you can actually see the guy, the assailant, sitting down watching her burn until a police officer comes up to him and tells him to leave the area.
[00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:28.039]  Well, that's right.
[00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:42.659]  And we're showing the video because the corporate media doesn't want us to You know, we're all shown when a white person kills a black person, we're all shown it and it's not blurred out, but she appears to be white, the part of her that's not on fire.
[00:47:43.019 --> 00:47:55.940]  And so I'm not saying it was racially motivated, but you know, if it was a white crazy person burning a innocent brown person, they would not be blurring the images and they would be saying it was racial regardless of the facts.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:02.199]  I mean, watching and listening to this guy and seeing him, he just looks like he is a complete schizophrenic or something.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:11.059]  I don't know that, but I think it's a safe bet in dead reckoning to say this guy's a complete lunatic, which is all the more reason New Yorkers should be able to be armed.
[00:48:13.059 --> 00:48:13.460]  Absolutely.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.500]  I mean, especially women in New York.
[00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:21.840]  You know, I went to New York with my girlfriend not too long ago, you know, for the Madison Square Garden rally.
[00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:24.579]  And I would not let her out of my sight.
[00:48:24.659 --> 00:48:27.539]  She wasn't allowed to walk around by herself because I know how these people are.
[00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:30.679]  You know, Alex, you just said that people mess with you.
[00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:33.239]  And, you know, you're a built dude.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.239]  You're a built guy.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.699]  I mean, I'm not going to mess with you.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.980]  That's for danger.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.219]  But she's like five foot six and petite.
[00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:44.070]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:48:44.289 --> 00:48:51.309]  My wife, when she was in college, went to New York for an educational trip.
[00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.829]  She got mugged outside of a...
[00:48:56.179 --> 00:49:01.920]  Sub shop, and again, it was four black people that did it, and they yelled racial stuff at her.
[00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:04.199]  And I'm not trying to bash black people.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.300]  I'm explaining that while I was thinking, I just thought of that story.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.340]  I mean, this is a serious situation.
[00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:12.940]  And that was 20 years ago.
[00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:14.420]  Right.
[00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:18.940]  And from what I've read, New York has the highest crime it's ever had right now.
[00:49:20.269 --> 00:49:23.349]  Yeah, burglaries are up almost 200%.
[00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:26.730]  Murders are up over 200. This is in four years.
[00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:31.530]  In four years, you have those crime rates, those violent crime rates up that far.
[00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:38.070]  Is it a coincidence that they've imported hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of violent illegals?
[00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:43.409]  Keep in mind, this is a migrant that was deported under Trump.
[00:49:43.409 --> 00:49:45.230]  He was an illegal that was deported under Trump.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:52.480]  He came in on June 1st of 2018, and within six days, Trump had already deported him back to Guatemala.
[00:49:53.289 --> 00:50:06.670]  And then he came back under the Biden administration and, you know, they opened up the gates for him, brought him in, bought him a bus ticket to New York City and let him stay in one of the taxpayer-funded migrant shelters up there.
[00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:08.949]  So that all happened under the Biden regime.
[00:50:09.329 --> 00:50:19.349]  And so how many more of those people has Biden, you know, that Trump removed, has Biden left in the country, in New York, that are going to carry out these same sorts of crimes?
[00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.550]  We don't know.
[00:50:23.289 --> 00:50:30.050]  In closing, what do you make of the corporate media, both in Germany and in the U.S. and New York, saying, oh, a car killed a bunch of people.
[00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.389]  Oh, a woman just burst into flames.
[00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:33.989]  I mean, do they not know?
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.610]  And they were saying that when it was already known that it was deliberate.
[00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:45.829]  Do they not know that people are on to that scam that only enrages people and further destroys what's left of the corporate media?
[00:50:47.219 --> 00:50:54.400]  Well, they can't let go of their perceived idea that they have this power to control the narrative still.
[00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:56.019]  They absolutely do not.
[00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.000]  They have lost it, and it's not even close.
[00:50:59.099 --> 00:50:59.559]  They're dying.
[00:50:59.679 --> 00:51:03.980]  That's why you see MSNBC close to bankruptcy.
[00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:09.460]  You see ABC News having to admit and pay out Trump $15 million.
[00:51:10.289 --> 00:51:11.429]  We're making things up.
[00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.610]  Nobody trusts these people anymore.
[00:51:13.889 --> 00:51:23.210]  They come to X, they come to you, and they come to other, you know, non-legacy media networks to get their news.
[00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.610]  This stuff isn't working.
[00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:25.929]  People see right through it.
[00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.610]  And that was proven in November.
[00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:45.150]  And Alex, last week, that CR bill that Mike Johnson, the guy that's owned by the Democrats, tried to force through 1,500 pages We on X and Elon Musk, the alternative media, whatever they want to call us,
[00:51:45.329 --> 00:51:48.110]  we were the ones that were able to kill that 1,500-page bill.
[00:51:48.429 --> 00:51:51.909]  The legacy media didn't do it, nor do they have the power to do it at this point.
[00:51:52.389 --> 00:51:57.130]  For years and years and years, they were able to get away with all this stuff no longer.
[00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:58.570]  Those days are over.
[00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:02.059]  Nick, I really want to thank you for the time.
[00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:05.780]  Everybody should follow you on X. We'll put your X handle up on screen.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.000]  But just a quick 60-second snapshot.
[00:52:08.519 --> 00:52:11.659]  I mean, we the people have been the media for really over a decade.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.699]  We've been bigger than the corporate media.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.219]  But now they've completely collapsed.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.300]  MSNBC, 50,000 viewers.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.960]  CNN, 50,000 viewers on average.
[00:52:19.099 --> 00:52:20.019]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:52:20.949 --> 00:52:25.829]  And they're now realizing they're a joke, still pretending they have the power, but it's becoming a bigger joke by the minute.
[00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.550]  And now there's this war on Elon Musk that only makes him stronger.
[00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.230]  Do they not realize they're getting their asses handed to them and that this is just the beginning?
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.699]  No, their egos are too big.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:36.780]  Their egos are too big.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.219]  They don't think they can be taken down until they're actually taken down.
[00:52:40.719 --> 00:52:55.519]  And I mean, as for like CNN and such, CNN, they get more views based on clips that you play on your show from CNN making fun of them than they do from people that are actually watching the CNN, the network.
[00:52:55.699 --> 00:53:14.340]  And keep in mind, every cable provider has CNN. So, I mean, you have hundreds of millions of people in the United States We're good to go.
[00:53:24.139 --> 00:53:31.719]  Pushing fake news, even though it was proven that we were right about Dan Crenshaw actually being the one behind congressional pay raises.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.380]  And they were making fun of us for that on CNN. And it turns out CNN was wrong again.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.840]  And they were wrong about the...
[00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:45.369]  Venezuelan gangs kidnapping and shooting people and taking over everything.
[00:53:45.449 --> 00:53:46.750]  We had the video that you said.
[00:53:46.809 --> 00:53:47.269]  It's not true.
[00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:51.869]  The Haitians aren't crashing cars into people and eating all the cats and dogs.
[00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.550]  Of course, they were.
[00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.530]  Nick Sordor, incredible job.
[00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:55.269]  God bless you, brother.
[00:53:55.469 --> 00:53:55.969]  Have a great Christmas.
[00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.230]  Appreciate you, Alex.
[00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:57.630]  Merry Christmas.
[00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:59.090]  All right.
[00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:08.329]  I also want to get into the origins of the modern Santa Claus.
[00:54:08.469 --> 00:54:09.889]  People say, Jones, let's talk about Santa Claus.
[00:54:09.989 --> 00:54:10.610]  This is important.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.920]  I'll get to that later in the next hour after I cover all this world news, political stuff.
[00:54:15.059 --> 00:54:20.900]  But if you understand the modern Santa Claus, and I'm serious when I say this, you understand everything.
[00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:23.000]  This is a big deal.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.159]  This is not satire.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.719]  Please stay with me.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.920]  I'll cover the Santa Claus thing at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.659]  Because I saw an excellent report on it that went viral last week.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.980]  And I thought, I've talked about this, but this guy did a really good job.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.500]  I need to explain this to people.
[00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:38.840]  Because this guy nails it.
[00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:43.619]  And I haven't talked about the real origins of modern Christmas and Santa Claus in probably six, seven years.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.280]  And it's a big deal.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.139]  We're going to go to break.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:51.480]  I also have a big announcement I'm going to make at six after next hour.
[00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.760]  I was going to do it right now, but I'm out of time.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.260]  And this is very exciting for the listeners, extremely exciting for everybody.
[00:54:58.519 --> 00:55:02.800]  This is a big deal in the info war, not just for our operation, but for everybody.
[00:55:03.019 --> 00:55:08.159]  So a huge issue in the fight for free speech, which is the fight for everything coming up.
[00:55:09.159 --> 00:55:17.179]  Separately, give yourself the gift this Christmas and into the new year of a healthier, better vibrancy and lifestyle.
[00:55:17.559 --> 00:55:20.440]  And people ask, man, Jones, why do you look so much better?
[00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:21.699]  Why have you lost so much weight?
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.340]  What's going on?
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.880]  I've been religiously taking all the supplements.
[00:55:25.719 --> 00:55:30.639]  I just get to where I forget to take them, and then I just tell people to take them, and I'm not.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.400]  And it's been some diet and some increased exercise things, but it's the supplements.
[00:55:35.539 --> 00:55:36.760]  That's 50% of it.
[00:55:37.139 --> 00:55:45.719]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want ultimate turmeric, the strongest turmeric concentrate with super strong concentrated ginger and black pepper extract.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.260]  Incredible for your whole immune system, your body, your metabolic system.
[00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:52.659]  Inflammation.
[00:55:53.739 --> 00:55:54.579]  Knocks it out.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.119]  It's up to 55% off right now.
[00:55:57.199 --> 00:56:01.980]  You get several bottles of it at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:02.139 --> 00:56:08.800]  There's the ultimate superfood, ultimate Irish sea moss formula with the bladder rack and burdock.
[00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:18.590]  We're good to go.
[00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:44.909]  We'll be right back on the other side with so much news and more.
[00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.070]  Please spread the word.
[00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:47.829]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.889]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:53.889]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.739]  So, We need to stay on air.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.360]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.340]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:07.360]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:11.340]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.940]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:20.809]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:22.710]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:26.170]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.070]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:31.210]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:33.389]  Unfortunately...
[00:57:34.289 --> 00:57:38.110]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:45.050]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it if that continues.
[00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.050]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:48.909]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:49.710]  I designed it.
[00:57:49.809 --> 00:57:56.130]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.630]  They are a piece of history.
[00:57:57.989 --> 00:57:59.630]  They're pure silver.
[00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.389]  They are minted here in America.
[00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:04.889]  2,000 of these.
[00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:07.349]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:11.730]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.969]  They are incredible.
[00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:19.750]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:19.869 --> 00:58:27.860]  And it's not, the store is not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:31.199]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.119]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:48.170]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:58:48.429 --> 00:58:50.769]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:58:51.369 --> 00:58:53.869]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:56.909]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.449]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.250]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:59:01.519 --> 00:59:04.519]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:59:04.659 --> 00:59:06.820]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:59:07.039 --> 00:59:08.079]  They surprised me with this.
[00:59:08.159 --> 00:59:09.179]  I just learned this morning.
[00:59:09.199 --> 00:59:13.539]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.880]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:59:16.059 --> 00:59:21.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stomp, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:24.099]  This is Trump on a Stomp Christmas figurine.
[00:59:24.219 --> 00:59:26.119]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.880]  We play with him, do all sorts of stuff.
[00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:30.969]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:59:31.429 --> 00:59:34.750]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:59:34.969 --> 00:59:35.550]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:39.510]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:41.590]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:42.409]  And I already called them.
[00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:44.550]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:45.469]  So that means there's...
[00:59:47.139 --> 00:59:48.940]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:59:49.099 --> 00:59:51.619]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.039]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:59:54.179 --> 00:59:55.300]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:56.519]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.280]  This baby is amazing.
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:03.619]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.539]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:00:07.699 --> 01:00:10.800]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:11.480]  Fully perfected.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:18.940]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance, from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:27.119]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump meeting inaugurated next month.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.900]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:37.179]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot Year, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fun the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:00:46.429 --> 01:00:50.329]  Alright, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:59.920]  There is a real situation we're facing with quantum computing and the threat it poses to Bitcoin.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.559]  But not just Bitcoin, everything.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.039]  So Max Keiser joins us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:11.099]  I'll be going on into the fourth hour today and taking your phone calls then.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:17.679]  But the next hour and a half before Max Keiser gets here, I have done a ton of research.
[01:01:19.369 --> 01:01:26.889]  And on the economy, on the Trump appointments, on Elon Musk, on so much that I want to hit this hour.
[01:01:27.949 --> 01:01:29.829]  And so that's all coming up.
[01:01:29.989 --> 01:01:47.449]  But last night a friend, it's a seven minute report, I'm not going to play the whole thing, sent me a link to my Christmas message that we posted on December 24th last year, so 364 days ago.
[01:01:49.799 --> 01:01:54.380]  And I really predict what's about to happen in the next year and tell people to keep the faith.
[01:01:54.639 --> 01:01:59.960]  And now we're in such a better position than we were then, but that ups the stakes and makes the globalists more dangerous.
[01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:03.679]  So, talk about tomorrow's news today.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.480]  We are so blessed to be here, so honored.
[01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:08.659]  I am so thankful to the viewers and listeners keeping us on air.
[01:02:08.719 --> 01:02:09.840]  I am so thankful to the crew.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.440]  And of course, I'm going to shoot another Christmas message either today or tomorrow.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:20.239]  And of course, I'll be here live tomorrow, and I'm going to tape a special show for Christmas Day, because I'm so honored that you would join us then.
[01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:24.599]  But here's some of my Christmas message from a year ago tomorrow.
[01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:39.969]  It's Christmas 2023. And I wanted to put a message out here on X to all of our supporters and all the people who have stood with InfoWars over the years against the baseless attacks and disinformation of the deep state.
[01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:47.610]  Not just InfoWars, not just people of America, but the people of the world really are part of a great awakening that's happening right now.
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:49.530]  And so many good things are happening.
[01:02:50.190 --> 01:03:02.869]  Yes, we're learning about a lot of terrible horrors conducted by the globalists, and a lot of things have been happening around our noses, but that's part of the process of turning this ship around and getting it going in the right direction.
[01:03:03.449 --> 01:03:10.289]  So I wanted to just remind the listeners here at Christmas and at the end of the year about some of the really positive things that are happening.
[01:03:10.929 --> 01:03:12.289]  We see the numbers all over the world.
[01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:16.670]  Populist and anti-globalist are being elected everywhere.
[01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:20.869]  And the globalists are trying to indict him and are indicting him and are trying to rig elections.
[01:03:21.329 --> 01:03:31.210]  But despite that, the majority of elections, both regionally and nationally, from Latin America to Asia, to Europe, Eastern Europe, the UK, all over, it's happening.
[01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.289]  Look at Bukele in El Salvador in Central America.
[01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:49.949]  In just two years, he's totally turned the country around from the highest crime rate in Latin America and one of the lowest tourist rates to absolutely the lowest crime rate in Latin America, way lower than the US crime rate and an economy totally exploding and investment just flooding in.
[01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:53.250]  And I've been invited down there to meet with the leadership of the government.
[01:03:53.449 --> 01:03:55.070]  That's something we're planning to do very, very soon.
[01:03:55.389 --> 01:03:56.090]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:59.070]  Look at Argentina and Javier Malay.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.900]  Anti-globalists already cut the government by 50%.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.099]  The economy is already starting to turn around.
[01:04:05.519 --> 01:04:10.960]  And suddenly, one of the biggest countries in South America is not even in the news.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.239]  If I try to list everything else, it would make your head spin and it would take two hours.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.800]  But in New Zealand, they've elected an anti-globalist, anti-lockdown, anti-forced vaxxer.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:28.380]  And then if we look at the Netherlands, Gert Wilders has got elected, stopping the giant Islamic invasion against lockdowns, against forced injections.
[01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:38.679]  In Italy, they've elected an anti-globalist that pledges to bring down the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg Group, and the WEF, and is trying to stop them forcing synthetic meat and forced injections on them.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.420]  The same things happened in Sweden.
[01:04:41.199 --> 01:04:45.360]  Patriots are gaining in the UK. It's happening all over the place.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.739]  There is a Massive, massive awakening happening across the planet and right here in the United States.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:59.300]  But they're using the same tactics to go after all these great leaders they're using against myself, against President Trump, and against you.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:12.300]  This is a desperate global banking combine led by BlackRock that controls over 80% of the world's assets and wealth, in their own words, trying to force these behaviors on humanity.
[01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:23.070]  But their attempts at carbon taxes, their attempts to break up the family, their attempts to force transgenderism on children for depopulation is all meeting its match.
[01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:27.610]  And opposition is surging and beginning to turn the tide everywhere.
[01:05:27.849 --> 01:05:29.170]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:05:29.389 --> 01:05:36.030]  Look at what they tried to do with Trump with all these indictments and all these lawsuits and federal courts saying he can't be on the ballot.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.519]  I come to you from the embattled Infowars studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.340]  I want to give you an update on the attempts to shut us down here in a moment.
[01:05:52.199 --> 01:06:04.820]  And then I'm going to do the best I can to cover a massive amount of news until Max Keiser on a big Bitcoin quantum computing update in about an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.280]  Now, I spend a lot of time on...
[01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:11.920]  The big World War III developments in the first 30 minutes.
[01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:13.619]  There's some more I want to hit on that.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.800]  It'll take a few minutes, then I'm going to move into everything else.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:32.500]  We have an astounding statement by Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of DHS, trying to cover his evil child-trafficking ass from the incoming administration that has pledged to criminally investigate him.
[01:06:32.599 --> 01:06:33.300]  It's open and shut.
[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.889]  Saying, yeah, we know there's a bunch of kids trafficked.
[01:06:36.989 --> 01:06:39.110]  We even know where a lot of them are and that they're being abused.
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:40.389]  But that's not our jurisdiction.
[01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:45.789]  Well, if a citizen knows the next door neighbor's got enslaved kids and doesn't do anything, you're an accomplice.
[01:06:45.949 --> 01:06:47.510]  But they shipped them in.
[01:06:47.849 --> 01:06:49.449]  They protected the smugglers.
[01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.690]  They stopped the DNA testing.
[01:06:50.849 --> 01:06:51.710]  We have the Senate reports.
[01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.869]  Hell, it didn't even start with him.
[01:06:53.949 --> 01:06:54.650]  It started with Obama.
[01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:56.889]  We have a Senate report from nine years ago on that.
[01:06:57.969 --> 01:07:03.989]  So, just stunning clip that is coming up.
[01:07:06.429 --> 01:07:07.750]  On that front.
[01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:15.690]  And then, I hesitate to even get into this, but it just shows how the corporate media operates.
[01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:25.269]  Here I am, here's Elon Musk and others, Tucker Carlson, pointing out that in Europe, they just let the illegal aliens run wild, do whatever they want, just like here.
[01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:31.090]  And it's the same global politicians, so Elon's been criticizing the corrupt leadership in Germany.
[01:07:32.579 --> 01:07:53.280]  And so when this leftist lunatic promoted by BBC who smuggles women into Europe, human trafficker, who they refuse to extradite, runs over a bunch of people at a Christmas event and kills some and wounds a whole bunch, maims a bunch, they come out and blame Elon Musk and myself all over the news.
[01:07:54.159 --> 01:07:57.730]  Now, That's because we're exposing them.
[01:07:57.969 --> 01:07:59.510]  But it just...
[01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:02.250]  This is not rocket scientist stuff.
[01:08:02.909 --> 01:08:07.730]  Whoever the globalists are attacking is who needs to be supported.
[01:08:08.449 --> 01:08:10.409]  And I love what Musk is doing.
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:13.829]  I mean, his tweets, his work, reaching hundreds and hundreds of millions a day, it's amazing.
[01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:24.750]  My point is that I am not Donald Trump, who barely hung on, and Musk, who's winning big time but is under major attack.
[01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:25.890]  I don't have...
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.100]  One one millionth of the money they have.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.140]  And I can't do this without you.
[01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:35.659]  And our work is important.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.779]  It's seen by the bad guys as very important.
[01:08:38.659 --> 01:08:44.079]  And we're conservatively reaching, with the main show every day, 60 million people.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.899]  The clips, you can't even keep track of it.
[01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:47.520]  It's in the billions a month.
[01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.920]  Of people that, you know, of clips watched.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.680]  It's hundreds of millions a month watching our information.
[01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:54.500]  And it gets picked up by everybody.
[01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:58.329]  Our research gets parroted by everybody else, which is wonderful.
[01:08:58.489 --> 01:09:03.050]  I don't even care about the credit, other than the fact that you get the credit for keeping this show on the air.
[01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:11.029]  So it's you, recognized by the globalist, and this focal point that's Infowars, that's turning the tide globally.
[01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.010]  But we have turned the tide.
[01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.010]  We're winning big time.
[01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:17.789]  But that's why they want to accelerate World War III and more.
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.170]  So, here's the big announcement, and it's...
[01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:35.189]  Really exciting, and it's also a no-brainer, and it's something I should have done previously, but the folks at Bigly are great business managers and great marketers and great product producers.
[01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:46.399]  They produce some of the top Patriot Apparel and products for most of the big anti-globalist hosts that you know out there like Steven Crowder and the Hives Twins and countless others.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.420]  Over 100 folks they work with for shows.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:55.199]  And out of Arkansas, they're doing a great job with the highest quality supplements of Patriot Apparel for the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.619]  So they've been working on this for a few months.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:06.659]  They've got a great affiliate program with the best software program and a third-party company that's one of the top companies managing it for them and for us.
[01:10:08.319 --> 01:10:15.000]  And if you go to thealexjonesstore.com, right by the VIP program, it gives you $40 a month spent in the store for $30.
[01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:17.779]  So if you're going to buy product, you make $10 on it.
[01:10:17.819 --> 01:10:18.180]  Why not?
[01:10:18.279 --> 01:10:21.180]  So if you're going to be a supporter, then you've got to be a VIP member.
[01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:28.420]  But right by the VIP member area, there is, and we're announcing it today, the Alex Jones Store Affiliate Program.
[01:10:28.899 --> 01:10:32.159]  Now, most affiliate programs give people 3%, 4%, 5%.
[01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:35.539]  The very best affiliate programs do 10%.
[01:10:35.539 --> 01:10:38.020]  And there's not a lot of markup in the t-shirts.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.159]  And when the supplements are on sale, not there either.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:47.779]  So a 10% affiliate program is massive.
[01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:50.319]  But we want to reach new people.
[01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:54.899]  And we believe in the listeners.
[01:10:56.079 --> 01:10:59.060]  And so this is very exciting.
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:10:59.699]  So it's simple.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.000]  You go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:11:02.979 --> 01:11:18.600]  You go click, you sign up to be an affiliate, and then when you go on X or Facebook or anywhere and you post a video or an article, or you post an image of a hot t-shirt or a great supplement, maybe you love the CMOS,
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:32.020]  maybe you love the Ultimate Turmeric, maybe you like a particular ball cap, and you just post it and say, hey, support Alex Jones and the Infowar and get these great products, or however you want to promote it, and then boom!
[01:11:32.899 --> 01:11:38.340]  Every month, you get paid 10% of the sale.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.739]  Now, a lot of other shows have done this, and it's been very successful for them, and it's been great for the listeners and viewers.
[01:11:45.579 --> 01:12:01.859]  So, this is a godsend, and you have my pledge, that all the money that comes in from this will go to keep us on air, and will go for the legal defense against the globalists trying to shut us down.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:12.739]  I mean, 95% of the money that comes in right now is being sent to fight the globalists.
[01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:14.619]  I'm not daddy war bugs.
[01:12:14.779 --> 01:12:15.960]  I'm not against being rich.
[01:12:16.039 --> 01:12:19.460]  I wish I had billions of dollars, but I'm really not into that type of stuff.
[01:12:19.619 --> 01:12:21.000]  I like a nice car.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.520]  I'm not going to fly first class on a plane, whatever.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.939]  But I'm the type of guy that thinks about vacation.
[01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:27.380]  My idea of vacation is camping.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.359]  That's what I want to be on a mountaintop camping or glamping like I was in the last six days.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.199]  Show, because there was a, you know, bubbles.
[01:12:35.399 --> 01:12:35.920]  Bubbles are cool.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.180]  You know, they've got an air pump, keeps them pumped up, so you know, glamping.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:45.359]  So, I love fighting tyrants, and I need funds to do it.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.239]  I'm in a war with the globalists, so these are amazing products, thelexionstore.com.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:13:08.840]  This is a great way for you to make money while promoting freedom and liberty and making people healthy, healthier, and at the same time, Meeting like-minded people, because when you wear an Alex Jones shirt or an Infowars shirt or a Donald Trump shirt or a 1776 Patriots shirt,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.800]  there's really three categories.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.979]  We don't have many categories, but there's the 1776 Americana Patriot gear.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.159]  Then there's the Trump won Trump revolution gear.
[01:13:18.279 --> 01:13:19.739]  Then there's the Alex Jones Infowars gear.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.819]  And then I guess there's also funny shirts.
[01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.659]  So there's Patriot comedy gear.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.539]  So there's over 300 t-shirt, hoodies, Christmas sweater, ball cap designs now.
[01:13:30.699 --> 01:13:36.909]  It's over 300. So, some of the best designs, definitely the largest selection.

[01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:02.260]  So, that is an insanely cool thing.
[01:15:04.119 --> 01:15:06.020]  And it's got top-of-the-line software.
[01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:07.079]  It works like a charm.

[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.420]  And quite frankly...
[01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:19.750]  I'm going to be reaching out to a lot of the top marketers I already know and saying, hey, join this.
[01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:28.590]  And we're already getting people calling this, even though this just got announced on the site last night and saying absolutely.
[01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:33.130]  So it's very, very simple to do.
[01:15:33.289 --> 01:15:35.949]  You already have a post on X. You're already posting an article, a video.
[01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:43.829]  Just add a link down there at the bottom or have a statement or wear your shirt or talk about what the product's done for you or your family.
[01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:45.350]  And boom.
[01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:47.750]  Keep the show in the air.
[01:15:47.949 --> 01:15:48.930]  You get great products.
[01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:49.630]  You make money.
[01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:50.449]  You help other people.
[01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:52.710]  That's what I like is a 360 win.
[01:15:52.789 --> 01:15:53.829]  And this scares the globalists.
[01:15:54.569 --> 01:16:05.489]  Again, when World Net Daily, Joseph Farrow, this is now like 14 years ago, they sued the Clinton Foundation, not the big global one, the Clinton Library Foundation, to get their earliest presidential documents, and they got them.
[01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:23.100]  And the first thing they did upon getting in office when he was in president-elect in 1992 was Before he even got in, a few months later in 1993, was meet with the State Department and other agencies about suppressing conservatives and populists building their own community.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:31.510]  And so we've got to audit people making underground films about The corrupt Democratic Party, like the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:43.409]  And they listed newsletters and publishers that were exposing the New World Order because they said, if people start supporting this and this is already popular, it's going to take over and we're going to get defeated by it.
[01:16:43.789 --> 01:16:47.289]  And they put people through hell, prison, attacks, lawsuits.
[01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:51.970]  I mean, this didn't just start nine years ago when Trump was running or ten years ago.
[01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:53.109]  It just got worse.
[01:16:54.869 --> 01:16:59.789]  And I've been going through it intensely for, I've been getting messed with for about 29 years.
[01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:02.149]  I was on here about a year and a half before it started getting crazy.
[01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.670]  And if I told you, I've forgotten more than I can even remember.
[01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:07.289]  I mean, it's just, it's been insane.
[01:17:07.909 --> 01:17:08.729]  But it's been fun.
[01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:09.609]  I mean, it's an adventure.
[01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.789]  I'm battling tyrants.
[01:17:10.909 --> 01:17:11.850]  I knew what I signed up for.
[01:17:13.899 --> 01:17:18.279]  And then they said the sex operatives, and then the death threats, and then the harassing my family.
[01:17:18.439 --> 01:17:28.819]  I mean, it's been interesting, but God has held my spirit up in this fight, and you have empowered me with word of mouth and financial support and prayer.
[01:17:28.819 --> 01:17:30.119]  So thank you so much.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:33.560]  We are a family, and this is beyond cool.
[01:17:34.539 --> 01:17:37.239]  And I talked about it for years.
[01:17:37.239 --> 01:17:40.720]  It just gets so busy that I... Never got it done for Infowars.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.439]  Well, it's done for the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:50.119]  And again, it's time to take action.
[01:17:51.039 --> 01:17:54.920]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.800]  And you can make supplemental money very easily.
[01:18:00.029 --> 01:18:02.989]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:09.229]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:19.510]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[01:18:19.649 --> 01:18:22.329]  I mean, this is exciting.
[01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:27.369]  So, go now to theallocshowstore.com.
[01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:35.630]  And one other thing, there are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[01:18:35.829 --> 01:18:37.550]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[01:18:37.649 --> 01:18:42.409]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[01:18:42.789 --> 01:18:45.550]  And then the sponsor gets half and we get half.
[01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:50.949]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:59.090]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[01:19:00.829 --> 01:19:04.329]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in, the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:08.510]  So, you know, $6, $7, $8, $9 for the poster costs with the packaging.
[01:19:09.489 --> 01:19:11.210]  And then we're selling it for $25, $30.
[01:19:11.569 --> 01:19:13.449]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:14.869]  So you know you're buying something.
[01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.229]  It's a memento that you really backed what we're doing.
[01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:21.010]  The campaign coins, the challenge coins, they're all there.
[01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.489]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:28.569]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:34.409]  But the posters, On January 6th will be no more.
[01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:36.130]  They're limited edition.
[01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:40.050]  So if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print-on-demand.
[01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:40.630]  They're in Arkansas.
[01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:43.430]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:50.729]  They are at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:57.050]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.340]  And so that's that.
[01:20:02.479 --> 01:20:04.239]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:05.640]  They look great head on the wall.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.460]  We got them hanging here in the office.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:15.300]  And I designed all of these for what it's worth.
[01:20:16.199 --> 01:20:17.720]  I didn't come up with the darkest hour one.
[01:20:17.859 --> 01:20:18.699]  That's my least favorite.
[01:20:18.899 --> 01:20:20.560]  I just don't look like Winston Churchill.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.279]  I'm not against it.
[01:20:21.319 --> 01:20:21.880]  Maybe you like it.
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.939]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election.
[01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:28.989]  That predicted the election.
[01:20:28.989 --> 01:20:31.189]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:37.390]  So the blue line goes up and goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.350]  And that's actually the graph that actually happens.
[01:20:40.689 --> 01:20:41.789]  The key battlegrounds.
[01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:43.729]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:46.550]  That's my favorite.
[01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:47.489]  I designed that one.
[01:20:47.829 --> 01:20:50.729]  I designed the other simple black on white and red on white.
[01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:53.850]  Black.
[01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.890]  And I came up with a Star Wars cheesy one.
[01:20:56.949 --> 01:20:57.869]  That's actually the most popular.
[01:20:58.029 --> 01:20:58.569]  It's not my favorite.
[01:20:58.670 --> 01:20:59.149]  I think it's funny.
[01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.869]  And then the 47 one I designed as well.
[01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:03.130]  So I designed those.
[01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:05.250]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one.
[01:21:05.329 --> 01:21:06.050]  But there it is.
[01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:06.829]  Thank you for the support.
[01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:07.550]  I'm done plugging.
[01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:12.430]  But I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:15.819]  And I realize how much money it takes to take these people on.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.340]  And they are so pissed we're still on air.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.039]  And I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:20.859]  That's why we're winning.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.399]  And they tell me that we're going to really continue to have victory.
[01:21:26.079 --> 01:21:31.300]  But my lawyers are working Seven days a week.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.500]  I go and meet with them almost every day.
[01:21:33.779 --> 01:21:35.520]  They call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:37.279]  I want you to read this and sign it and make sure it's accurate.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:46.060]  If I told you all the suits we filed on and all the crap we're doing to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:46.859]  I've got to go on offense.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.960]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[01:21:49.979 --> 01:21:51.239]  But you want me to fight?
[01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:51.859]  I'm fighting.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.930]  So You're financing the current operation.
[01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:58.369]  You're financing the backup Alex Jones network if it gets shut down.
[01:21:58.609 --> 01:22:01.949]  And that's still getting built and expanded, not a larger studio.
[01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.930]  It's almost done.
[01:22:03.869 --> 01:22:06.029]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:07.210]  I mean, this is a war.
[01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.409]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[01:22:08.869 --> 01:22:09.789]  I love it.
[01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:13.149]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:14.770]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:16.109]  You commission me.
[01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:24.170]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me And I will give you everything I got.
[01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:31.550]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff they've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:34.890]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:36.829]  And we make it easy with incredible products.
[01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:37.590]  Okay, I'm done.
[01:22:38.329 --> 01:22:41.369]  But here's the update on the situation in Full Wars.
[01:22:46.590 --> 01:23:01.380]  We have survived three attempts By two different federal Justice Department trustees since May 31st to close this place outside of their authority, in my opinion, illegally.
[01:23:02.739 --> 01:23:06.939]  And the first time they came in here with private security and said, get out of the building, I said, where's the court order?
[01:23:07.039 --> 01:23:07.319]  I'm not leaving.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:15.000]  And then the judge got rid of the U.S. trustee and their CRO on June 14th over that.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.260]  They brought a new guy in.
[01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:22.869]  Who on November 14th said, get out of the building without a court order.
[01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:29.149]  And then just, he'd already gotten the information for the internet service providers.
[01:23:29.289 --> 01:23:33.350]  He was a little smarter and had them cut us off.
[01:23:33.449 --> 01:23:35.590]  So I wasn't going to leave, but they cut the internet off.
[01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:36.189]  So I had to leave.
[01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:40.989]  We had our backup down the road and we didn't skip a beat because of you and the crew and your support.
[01:23:41.489 --> 01:23:42.869]  That was a major investment.
[01:23:43.029 --> 01:23:44.609]  Satellite uplinks, you know, whole nine yards.
[01:23:45.829 --> 01:23:47.850]  Servers, just, you know, all separate systems.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.340]  Millions.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:24:11.199]  And then on the 9th, a few days before that, he called up and told the crew and everybody, yeah, are we going to have to have the police come when the judge shuts you down on this 9th hearing?
[01:24:12.439 --> 01:24:13.520]  And we got to throw you out.
[01:24:13.619 --> 01:24:14.859]  And we said, no, we got a judge's order, we'll leave.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.979]  Well, the judge said that the sale never happened and it was a scam, basically, and said no.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.500]  But he didn't get rid of the U.S. trustee.
[01:24:24.579 --> 01:24:25.779]  He said, you can quit if you want.
[01:24:26.279 --> 01:24:29.899]  He said, I want you to bring me a real deal and a real sale.
[01:24:31.039 --> 01:24:35.579]  Now, since then, and I'm not going to release all this yet, but...
[01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:50.569]  Buyer came, way more money, cash, and they just said, oh no, the plaintiffs don't want Jones to have InfoWars, even if it's somebody else that owns it.
[01:24:51.149 --> 01:25:00.449]  So we're just going to continue to claim the billion, 300 million made-up stuff he owes that's still on appeal is money.
[01:25:00.449 --> 01:25:01.869]  So it doesn't matter how high you go.
[01:25:03.939 --> 01:25:05.439]  It could be a billion dollars.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.760]  It's not for sale.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.300]  So we're going to deal with that with the judge, and it's just ongoing.
[01:25:10.579 --> 01:25:12.560]  I mean, it is a fiasco.
[01:25:13.319 --> 01:25:26.039]  And this Chris Murray, new U.S. trustee that came in on June 14th, he wouldn't really talk to me at the hearing when he got appointed that day, and then he wouldn't talk to me for over a month, but finally on the phone, my lawyers and his lawyers...
[01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.770]  Wolf Shaw and the other lady's name Jones.
[01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:34.170]  I had like a 45-minute conversation with him and we got the minutes of it and all the rest of it.
[01:25:34.710 --> 01:25:37.649]  It was on an evening.
[01:25:38.489 --> 01:25:40.670]  And I said, okay, well, the judge ordered a sale.
[01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:41.210]  That's fine.
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:42.770]  May the best man win.
[01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:49.510]  And he said, well, the families, means Democratic Party, they don't want you to have InfoWars or that name.
[01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:51.670]  So how do you feel about that not being for sale?
[01:25:53.859 --> 01:25:58.000]  And I said, well, the judge ordered it, sold, and I've liquidated it, so that's the last thing I own.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.899]  You know, go ahead, let's see if you can bid more.
[01:26:03.079 --> 01:26:05.560]  And he goes, okay, we'll go ahead and sell that too.
[01:26:05.699 --> 01:26:12.460]  And then they say it's going to be a public auction, then it's not two days before, and you know the whole story, and then the judge said it wasn't a real auction and stopped it.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.420]  That's three times.
[01:26:16.579 --> 01:26:22.439]  Now, I don't know what they're going to pull or what's going to happen.
[01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:28.630]  But Bloomberg is financing it through every town.
[01:26:28.829 --> 01:26:29.430]  They admit that.
[01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:38.569]  I can't take on Senator Blumenthal and Michael Bloomberg and the Democratic Party's main law firms without you.
[01:26:39.369 --> 01:26:47.130]  And quite frankly, I am literally ganged up by the globalists of the deep state and by the State Department, the CIA, the Justice Department.
[01:26:47.289 --> 01:26:47.909]  It's all come out.
[01:26:49.369 --> 01:26:54.210]  And if this was happening to anybody else, I would be speaking out and defending them.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.239]  And, you know, I've gotten, you know, Joe Rogan said it's wrong.
[01:26:59.399 --> 01:27:00.399]  Tucker's talked about it a lot.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.399]  I appreciate that.
[01:27:01.979 --> 01:27:10.279]  And I haven't really called up the incoming Trump administration and, you know, talked a lot about this when I met with J.D. Vance three months for the election in Detroit.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.600]  I brought this up and he said they were on it.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.659]  And I wasn't bringing myself up.
[01:27:13.739 --> 01:27:17.260]  I said the Obama network that's still there and they were fully aware of it.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.960]  And so that's now hit the news that they are going to be going after that.
[01:27:21.899 --> 01:27:27.420]  So, I've got a clip of that coming up that I'll be done talking about this, but this is a big deal.
[01:27:28.699 --> 01:27:42.739]  So, it's completely illegal, and finally it's in the news, and finally it's on the Trump radar screen, but I am currently under CIA, State Department, Justice Department targeting for destruction.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.020]  And it's come out in congressional documents.
[01:27:46.159 --> 01:27:47.340]  We'll show you when we come back.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:49.880]  I mean, we're in the big leagues here, folks.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.920]  I can't do this without you.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.399]  You understand that?
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.619]  I'm fighting for you.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.500]  Do you understand that?
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.340]  Two new incredible products just came in to the warehouse in Arkansas, and they are top of the line.

[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.579]  And then...
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.060]  I want them.
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.760]  Wish everyone an amazing, safe Christmas.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:06.840]  I would encourage people to pray and get closer to Christ, especially if you don't believe Christ is real.
[01:30:06.979 --> 01:30:09.399]  Why don't you reach out to God and ask God to show you?
[01:30:09.539 --> 01:30:12.619]  I think you'll be surprised what happens.
[01:30:12.779 --> 01:30:18.520]  Basically everybody I know that actually reaches out with an honest heart to God and says, I don't know if you're real.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.520]  I've been told you're not.
[01:30:19.659 --> 01:30:21.100]  But I see the evil in the world.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.020]  I also see the good.
[01:30:22.119 --> 01:30:22.800]  Will you show me?
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.300]  And if you have a sincere heart, God will show you.
[01:30:26.399 --> 01:30:27.140]  You will be amazed.
[01:30:28.699 --> 01:30:33.819]  Might hit you like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus right away, or it might happen a week from then.
[01:30:33.939 --> 01:30:36.920]  But something very miraculous, or a whole bunch of miraculous things will happen.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.659]  Depends on how sincere you are.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.260]  So this Christmas, I want you to know I love you, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:47.840]  If you love God, you love justice, and you want to be free, I am your brother.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.680]  I am your brethren.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:54.020]  And I want to wish you for myself and the whole InfoWars crew a blessed Christmas.
[01:30:54.739 --> 01:31:03.739]  Now, I started getting into this, and I remembered it ties into all these other stories, but I have had an intense frustration.
[01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:07.850]  Because I read news all day.
[01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:10.510]  I talk to the leading experts in every major field.
[01:31:11.909 --> 01:31:27.210]  And I knew going back to the end of World War II and the establishment of the National Security Act 1947 and the CIA that in 1976-77 in the Frank Church Senate hearings on the deep state.
[01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:29.789]  That's what they called it and that's what it is.
[01:31:30.649 --> 01:31:47.550]  The permanent globalist bureaucracy that there had been back then billions and billions and billions, which is hundreds of billions today with inflation, spent through the universities and the media and the culture directly through tax-free foundations and getting government money and directly through different agencies like the CIA,
[01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:56.670]  the National Endowment for Art, and later the National Education Association and all the rest of it, and now today BlackRock and all the corporate ESG funding.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.140]  Wherever you sign onto their agenda, you get unlimited money.
[01:32:02.439 --> 01:32:08.979]  That's why you get the unification of big corporations across the world in lockstep on every issue.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:19.340]  And we have major pressure through our governments, through our state governments, and through our own personal investments to say, we're not going to invest with you if you do that.
[01:32:19.399 --> 01:32:20.140]  And that's starting to happen.
[01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:21.880]  So there's a lot of positive things going on.
[01:32:22.659 --> 01:32:24.140]  And there's so many facets to it.
[01:32:24.159 --> 01:32:25.699]  I got on little rabbit trails just thinking about it.
[01:32:25.779 --> 01:32:26.760]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[01:32:29.749 --> 01:32:48.069]  Obama codified a bunch of this and expanded it in several pieces of legislation when he was leaving office in late 2016, early 2017. And we've posted hundreds of articles and reports on it.
[01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:52.770]  I've covered it thousands of times since Obama did this.
[01:32:52.909 --> 01:32:59.250]  And every time Trump would call me or I'd see Trump, And he'd be, you know, just doing what he does to his political supporters.
[01:32:59.250 --> 01:32:59.909]  Oh, you're great.
[01:32:59.989 --> 01:33:00.449]  How you doing?
[01:33:00.569 --> 01:33:01.390]  Oh, your show's so good.
[01:33:01.569 --> 01:33:05.750]  I'd say, hey, sir, these are the people in your administration, and this is the organization.
[01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:07.529]  Here's the organization.
[01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:13.189]  And Obama got billions of funding in for what are called stay-behind networks, Mr. President.
[01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:16.489]  And they're inside these agencies working against you.
[01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:17.390]  They're spying on you.
[01:33:17.449 --> 01:33:18.630]  They're tapping all your communications.
[01:33:19.869 --> 01:33:24.689]  And he'd write it down, and he'd get administration people on the phone with me.
[01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:28.850]  I'd tell him, sir, you know they're all over TV saying they're going to kill you.
[01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:29.850]  Who is?
[01:33:30.029 --> 01:33:35.609]  You must have missed it on CNN, MSNBC. Phil Mudd, former deputy head of the CIA, says they're going to kill you.
[01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:36.449]  Really?
[01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:40.489]  Okay, I'm going to have the Secret Service call you in the next couple hours.
[01:33:40.689 --> 01:33:42.090]  Ten minutes later, Secret Service calls.
[01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:44.789]  So that's when you saw the headlines.
[01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:48.069]  The main job of the Chief of Staff is keeping Trump away from Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:48.770]  Remember those headlines?
[01:33:50.510 --> 01:34:01.529]  So, when he's President-elect, when he's President-elect, Anytime he called me, and sometimes I could get on the phone with him, and he'd say, give me a report.
[01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:05.710]  Or he'd say, shoot a clip and get it to me.
[01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:09.050]  And so I'd go shoot a report and say, here's an emergency message to the president.
[01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:14.310]  And then I got big law firms, and I'd meet with them and write bullet points.
[01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:21.829]  And when I started having law firms file reports to the president, that's when the deep state went, get that son of a bitch.
[01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:35.760]  Because I was delivering to him the legislation that was passed And explaining to him who was who in his administration.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:41.460]  And they later had a 60 Minutes thing about Alex Jones was so mean, he got a bunch of people fired like Fiona Hill.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:50.420]  And she's like, Alex Jones is mean to me in front of Congress and all the rest of the woman is on the board of the Soros Open Society Foundation.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.920]  She's one of the editors and publishers at theglobalist.com.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.460]  And they'd ask her in Congress, are you a globalist?
[01:34:58.539 --> 01:34:59.920]  I don't even know what that is.
[01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:03.649]  We've played these clips, in case you think I'm joking.
[01:35:04.569 --> 01:35:08.930]  So, imagine.
[01:35:10.409 --> 01:35:11.630]  We know the legislation.
[01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:12.810]  I'll show you again here in a moment.
[01:35:14.289 --> 01:35:18.170]  And they passed a bunch of other stuff under Biden that we'll show you in a moment.
[01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:20.350]  You can look up legislation for yourself.
[01:35:21.689 --> 01:35:26.430]  And I've tried to put it all together, but there's so much, I can't even keep track of it.
[01:35:26.569 --> 01:35:36.310]  But you've seen the irrational hearings the last few years on the weaponization through the different agencies, the Justice Department, the CIA, and the State Department, through the media, and telling them who to censor on big tech and the rest of it.
[01:35:37.210 --> 01:35:42.449]  Or threatening to take them over and get rid of their Section 230 if they didn't.
[01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:44.609]  Take away their utility status.
[01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:48.329]  It's completely illegal to have government colluding with corporations to censor people.
[01:35:50.409 --> 01:36:00.109]  And the last number I could come up with that we know of, under Obama it was around $10 billion, and under Biden it looks like over $20 billion.
[01:36:01.710 --> 01:36:07.979]  In these agencies, So, remember last week you saw the headlines that came out in new government documents in Congress?
[01:36:08.119 --> 01:36:09.800]  Because the Republicans are already taking over.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.159]  The Democrats didn't shred it all.
[01:36:12.479 --> 01:36:15.119]  Like, they erased all the Jan 6 stuff, but there's a bunch of it there.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:18.579]  And just last week was that Congressman Massey releases the new document.
[01:36:19.079 --> 01:36:32.829]  In just the last two years, $300 million was spent just targeting Elon Musk in one payment To Thomson Reuters.
[01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:39.289]  Reuters is not just the global, like AP, but it's bigger, globally, propaganda arm.
[01:36:39.829 --> 01:36:42.930]  It's also the database, bigger than LexisNexis.
[01:36:43.069 --> 01:36:44.489]  It's PR firms.
[01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:45.449]  It's a whole system.
[01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:48.229]  They just pay them the money, and then these other networks do it.
[01:36:49.829 --> 01:36:54.630]  So $300 million in the last two years, targeting Elon Musk, his family...
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:05.939]  His companies to demonize him, say as a crook, to produce the propaganda so they could have 12 federal investigations of him, some criminal that have come out.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.659]  So he said last week they declared war on me, I declare war on them, I don't start fights but I finish them.
[01:37:10.699 --> 01:37:18.720]  Remember that post on X? So I raise that so you understand that we just know about the 300 million attacking Musk.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.260]  Imagine what it was on Trump.
[01:37:21.039 --> 01:37:36.180]  Now, the Democrats filed in federal court three weeks ago, this was headlined, That they've spent, if you don't believe me, just type in, Sandy Hook families, that means Democrat Party, look it up, have spent $316 million,
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:43.039]  I got it wrong, $326 million harassing me in the last six years.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.279]  Because they have to file their fees and what they spent.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:53.460]  Now obviously that's inflated and bloated, but $326 million trying to get Jones.
[01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:56.560]  I guarantee it's in the billions on Trump.
[01:37:57.359 --> 01:38:07.439]  So when you see every major publication that's corporate in the country put out the same or similar headlines the same minute, you always wonder why they'll publish like a thousand articles against Trump on the same minute.
[01:38:07.619 --> 01:38:16.939]  If you look at Google News, they'll say when it's published, it's because they have agreements with each other so that they all, quote, can get the scoop that they'll all publish the same second.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.539]  So it's totally coordinated.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:25.920]  Now, you hear a lot of this in Congress, and some documents come out, but it's way worse than they're saying.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:34.560]  And as bad as I know it is, being the victim of it, being the target of it, I don't know how bad it is.
[01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:45.859]  So, yeah, the head of the FBI in Connecticut gets up, testifies in the show trial two years ago that he quarterbacked the lawsuits and got them all going against me.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.739]  You know, I never said his name, I didn't even know who he was.
[01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:52.689]  For his work, he gets $130 million that I don't have.
[01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.470]  Look it up.
[01:38:54.569 --> 01:38:55.529]  $133 million, excuse me.
[01:38:56.810 --> 01:39:00.829]  So, I got all this other news, but this is important to get into.
[01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:16.510]  Because if Trump doesn't go in there and doesn't not just fire these people, but have the Justice Department indict them, and this is cut and dry, racketeering, illegal.
[01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:22.149]  And coming up, Mayorkas knows that on the human trafficking and trying to cover his ass down, so that's next.
[01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:23.590]  Then I'll get to World War III and the rest of it.
[01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:40.329]  But when I talked to J.D. Vance when I was at a TPUSA action event in Detroit, they took me in there to meet him in person because he said nice things about me over the years to fit in my free speech.
[01:39:40.689 --> 01:39:41.529]  And so we talked.
[01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:44.350]  And he said, yeah, I've got it.
[01:39:44.609 --> 01:39:46.470]  I'm going to be the VP. Didn't even say don't tell anybody.
[01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:47.649]  That was months before it was announced.
[01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:48.890]  I was like, wow, okay.
[01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:51.369]  Why didn't tell me not tell anybody?
[01:39:51.449 --> 01:39:52.750]  I guess they just knew I'd keep my mouth shut.
[01:39:53.609 --> 01:39:57.310]  And he wanted to talk about other stuff.
[01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:58.289]  And I said, hey, listen.
[01:39:59.090 --> 01:40:00.069]  His aide was right there.
[01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:00.689]  And I said, listen.
[01:40:01.949 --> 01:40:18.810]  It's the stay-behind networks, the countering propaganda disinformation network, and others that And I said, you've got to not just shut this down because they'll just do musical chairs.
[01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:20.289]  You've got to have them indicted.
[01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:21.890]  He goes, no, we're aware of that.
[01:40:21.989 --> 01:40:22.449]  We're on that.
[01:40:22.569 --> 01:40:23.090]  We're going to do that.
[01:40:23.869 --> 01:40:26.590]  And now Trump's talking about it just a few days ago.
[01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:28.409]  So this is important.
[01:40:30.039 --> 01:40:30.460]  All right?
[01:40:30.979 --> 01:40:45.000]  Because it's illegal to have the CIA and the State Department spend God knows how much money attacking me with PR firms and lies, then having show trials, producing it with HBO, having the FBI publicly run it, and do all of this.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.220]  I mean, this is serious criminal activity.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:55.880]  And the Daily Wire learned from the weaponization hearings this year that they'd been targeted as well.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.899]  And so they filed a lawsuit.
[01:40:58.439 --> 01:40:59.739]  And we intend to as well.
[01:40:59.859 --> 01:41:00.680]  It just takes more money.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.600]  And if we had it, we'd do it.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.140]  I mean, I'm full on in the fight that that's next.
[01:41:08.859 --> 01:41:13.079]  And the good news is more of this is coming out, so I'm just waiting until Trump gets in when we've got...
[01:41:13.079 --> 01:41:16.880]  We already have them dead to rights, but this is going to be just open and shut.
[01:41:18.659 --> 01:41:19.020]  So...
[01:41:20.649 --> 01:41:22.250]  Let me show you what the groups are.
[01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:24.029]  This is just the oldest one under Obama.
[01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:25.970]  There's been a bunch of new ones, and I'll show you the new one as well.
[01:41:26.529 --> 01:41:32.590]  U.S. repeal's propaganda ban spreads government-made news to Americans.
[01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:40.630]  Now that is the repeal of the laws that ban that, and this is 12 years ago.
[01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:46.109]  The battle over Obama's internet surrender.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:42:01.739]  And it goes to the organizations that he set up and these stay-behind networks, the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act is the technical name.
[01:42:02.119 --> 01:42:03.439]  Zero Hedge has one of the best articles.
[01:42:03.539 --> 01:42:04.340]  Infowars has them as well.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:22.130]  If you just type in Obama establishing a ministry of truth, and that will actually get you the Zero Hedge article from eight years and exactly Eight years.
[01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:28.770]  It was done in December of 2016. So that's important as well.
[01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:32.630]  So this is what...
[01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:33.430]  There it is.
[01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:36.829]  Obama quietly signs the counter-disinformation propaganda act in the law.
[01:42:37.909 --> 01:42:40.390]  So that is beyond key.
[01:42:41.289 --> 01:42:44.930]  Yeah, that's from the 12th of December.
[01:42:48.029 --> 01:42:55.470]  So now let me show you one of the new ones that Biden set up a few months into office almost four years ago.
[01:42:55.890 --> 01:42:59.310]  The GEC. Alright?
[01:43:00.609 --> 01:43:14.810]  And here is Mike Benz on air with talk show host Liz Wheeler just giving you a snapshot of this.
[01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:15.310]  Here it is.
[01:43:16.869 --> 01:43:21.229]  Obviously the Democrats want this because they want to censor us, but Mike Johnson kept that in the bill intentionally.
[01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:24.029]  He only discarded it after we all raised our voices.
[01:43:24.170 --> 01:43:24.850]  Why does he want it?
[01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:29.189]  The answer to this is a lot more complicated than I think people want to hear.
[01:43:29.329 --> 01:43:44.010]  About a week ago, the State Department filed a notice in court that informing the court and the plaintiffs in a case suing them for censoring American news companies, The Daily Wire and The Federalist sued the State Department for the Global Engagement Center's censorship operation.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:51.899]  The State Department responded to the court saying that it is substantially likely the Global Engagement Center will not be reauthorized.
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:44:05.680]  The State Department has transmitted a notice to Congress regarding its plan for the potential forthcoming termination of Global Engagement Center and its plan to realign the center's staff and funding to other department offices and bureaus for similar work.
[01:44:05.819 --> 01:44:11.640]  Basically, the Global Engagement Center network will continue whether there is a formal office or not.
[01:44:13.329 --> 01:44:16.970]  Alright, so just finishing up here.
[01:44:19.449 --> 01:44:21.409]  That's what they did when Trump got in.
[01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:25.590]  Trump did move against that group, so they just moved it into another office.
[01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:30.689]  And then Johnson just tried to do this again with the funding.
[01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:35.090]  So Johnson needs to be removed, obviously.
[01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:47.250]  And you can't leave a man behind When I got taken off the internet, I told Trump, I said, this is a pretext to set the precedent for you and others.
[01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.890]  And then it happened.
[01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:53.750]  And Trump paid lip service and said it was wrong, but then look what happened to him.
[01:44:54.909 --> 01:44:59.210]  It's not just the right thing to do for all the people that have been victimized by this to indict these people.
[01:45:00.689 --> 01:45:01.670]  It's cut and dry.
[01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:02.449]  It's open and shut.
[01:45:02.649 --> 01:45:03.430]  It's prima facie.
[01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:04.170]  It's on its face.
[01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:08.210]  They're going to continue to do this unless they get arrested.
[01:45:15.659 --> 01:45:18.020]  So, it must happen.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:18.920]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.149]  $300 million, which is the tip of the iceberg, Because I see the congressional funding.
[01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:27.090]  It's billions every year.
[01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:34.470]  But $300 million just to attack Elon Musk and attack his companies and attack his family and send PIs out.
[01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:39.449]  I mean, as much as I've been harassed, I can't even imagine how much Trump gets harassed.
[01:45:39.529 --> 01:45:42.229]  I can't even imagine how much Musk gets harassed.
[01:45:42.729 --> 01:45:46.430]  I know some of the inside baseball of how much Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan gets harassed.
[01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:50.369]  And what the left doesn't get is we're not cowards like them.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:46:06.380]  So, when you mess with Tucker Carlson, or you mess with Donald Trump, or you mess with Elon Musk, or you mess with Joe Rogan, I mean, I remember four years ago coming on air and I said, Joe Rogan's about to get really hardcore, watch everybody.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.979]  And he did, didn't he?
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.140]  Compared to where he was, you know, he did a 180, basically.
[01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:17.029]  That's because they thought because he was being nonpolitical, he could be bullied and messed with.
[01:46:17.069 --> 01:46:18.390]  And I knew he knew all this.
[01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:20.149]  And then, you know, I had dinner with him quite a bit.
[01:46:20.649 --> 01:46:23.710]  And so, you know, he was telling me how pissed he was and stuff going on behind the scenes.
[01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:26.250]  And I'm just like, dude, Joe Rogan's not a pussy.
[01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.829]  He's a badass.
[01:46:27.369 --> 01:46:28.329]  He's just a nice guy.
[01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:33.229]  So they thought messing with him would make him roll over.
[01:46:33.409 --> 01:46:34.210]  Well, look what you did.
[01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:36.229]  You created a monster in their perspective.
[01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:40.130]  And you thought messing with Elon Musk's family?
[01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:43.470]  You thought trying to indict him and harassing his companies?
[01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:47.590]  And the left basically kidnapping his son?
[01:46:47.729 --> 01:46:50.590]  That's what they do at these schools and castrating him chemically?
[01:46:50.789 --> 01:46:52.470]  His favorite kid at the time?
[01:46:53.289 --> 01:46:55.970]  You think that was going to get him to...
[01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:56.930]  I mean, you're crazy.
[01:46:57.310 --> 01:47:00.569]  And if you think messing with me and my family...
[01:47:08.409 --> 01:47:09.970]  It's going to make me back down.
[01:47:10.289 --> 01:47:12.229]  And my dad doesn't want me to talk about it.
[01:47:12.329 --> 01:47:13.630]  He asked me not to last night.
[01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:15.229]  I'm having...
[01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:25.649]  I'm so angry right now about what they just said to my dad last Friday and my mother that I was having dreams last night I don't like to have.
[01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:27.789]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.909]  So...
[01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:38.189]  I just want my enemies to know this, because I know the American people.
[01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:43.930]  And I think you already see the results, but you understand this isn't a bluff.
[01:47:44.369 --> 01:47:46.109]  You're in a lot of trouble, okay?
[01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:51.789]  And if you've got half a brain, you would stop now, but I know you're not.
[01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:52.710]  That's fine.
[01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:59.670]  The issue is, I will take no pleasure in your total destruction, because it'll hurt a lot of innocent people in the process.
[01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:00.869]  But you know what?
[01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:04.630]  You're going to have to have your asses completely handed to you.
[01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:06.109]  I get it.
[01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:07.909]  So, you will.
[01:48:08.909 --> 01:48:09.510]  You will.
[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:13.510]  And I don't know what's going to happen to me individually, but I see victory.
[01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:15.210]  I see success everywhere for humanity.
[01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:17.369]  I see all the trends.
[01:48:17.489 --> 01:48:20.289]  The globalists even admit in their own leaked documents that there's no way they can win.
[01:48:20.869 --> 01:48:21.510]  What are you going to do?
[01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:23.329]  Start a nuclear war so you can rule over the ashes?
[01:48:23.329 --> 01:48:25.609]  You're going to get dug out of your bunkers too by the survivors.
[01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:27.310]  You're done.
[01:48:29.449 --> 01:48:32.909]  So stop trying to commit suicide by patriot.
[01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:36.229]  Like idiots that go pull a gun on a cop to get killed.
[01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:40.210]  I mean, that's the level that you guys have reached.
[01:48:40.909 --> 01:48:42.630]  And I have a good life.
[01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:43.430]  I like living.
[01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:46.069]  I don't want a fight with you.
[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.510]  You start the fights.
[01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:48.409]  You're the bullies.
[01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:49.170]  You're the crooks.
[01:48:51.350 --> 01:49:01.399]  And Leadership in the world historically has not always been evil and Malthusian and trash.
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:06.699]  You don't need to be villains.
[01:49:07.439 --> 01:49:12.100]  But you look at the globalists, they're a bunch of wimps, so they think being a villain is tough.
[01:49:12.539 --> 01:49:13.199]  No.
[01:49:14.119 --> 01:49:16.319]  It's not tough.
[01:49:17.539 --> 01:49:18.520]  It's stupid.
[01:49:21.079 --> 01:49:32.020]  So, you're getting your ass kicked, and I can tell you from private conversations with high-up people that Trump has been hoping you guys just leave everybody alone.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.340]  And you can have a bunch of your stolen goodies and everything.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.819]  But you're not.
[01:49:37.819 --> 01:49:42.399]  So, since the election, the decision's been made to smash you.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.039]  Because you won't stop!
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.319]  Okay!
[01:49:49.890 --> 01:50:02.069]  You're like a bank robber that gets caught robbing the bank and is holding the tellers hostage and the cops are outside and the cops are telling you when you're threatening to kill the hostages, if you kill hostages, we're going to come in and it's going to go bad for you.
[01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:05.449]  And basically the left is starting to kill hostages.
[01:50:05.649 --> 01:50:06.510]  That's the analogy.
[01:50:06.609 --> 01:50:07.630]  And I'm just like, alright!
[01:50:09.789 --> 01:50:11.310]  I mean, you're beaten.
[01:50:13.489 --> 01:50:14.529]  You understand that?
[01:50:18.909 --> 01:50:26.220]  So, That's what this comes down to.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:34.859]  And I am completely ganged up on by these people.
[01:50:35.579 --> 01:50:37.619]  They've been saying in the news, well, we can't get Trump.
[01:50:37.779 --> 01:50:39.199]  Jones is a consolation prize.
[01:50:39.859 --> 01:50:40.899]  So I asked Trump.
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:41.800]  I asked the listeners.
[01:50:41.979 --> 01:50:42.760]  I asked society.
[01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:54.670]  Are you just going to sit here while the vampiric left has their way with me and my family when we help build the runway and the foundation of the good things that are happening?
[01:50:55.029 --> 01:50:57.409]  When my audience did that of activists?
[01:51:00.130 --> 01:51:03.210]  I want these people indicted.
[01:51:03.369 --> 01:51:04.510]  And the word is they are going to be.
[01:51:06.859 --> 01:51:11.000]  I want all the people that have been persecuting myself and my family to be prosecuted.
[01:51:11.159 --> 01:51:17.539]  I want the people that illegally spent $300 million of taxpayer money to harass and stalk Elon Musk to be arrested.
[01:51:17.539 --> 01:51:18.680]  That's racketeering.
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:23.960]  That's gangs of corporations and groups and government ganging up to torture someone.
[01:51:24.699 --> 01:51:30.659]  And of course, it turned Elon Musk into Godzilla.
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:42.779]  And these dumbasses don't seem to understand that most people, when you gang up on them and bully them, don't go get in the corner and pee on themselves.
[01:51:42.779 --> 01:51:43.979]  They get pissed.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:46.039]  They get organized.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.939]  And they come after you.
[01:51:49.319 --> 01:51:49.920]  Politically.
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:50.859]  Nonviolently.
[01:51:51.159 --> 01:51:51.619]  Lovingly.
[01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:53.840]  So...
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:58.060]  You're not giving us quarter.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.520]  Even though you're losing.
[01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:06.489]  So you're demanding we not give you quarter.
[01:52:07.590 --> 01:52:08.310]  You're stupid.
[01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:11.729]  You need to capitulate.
[01:52:12.989 --> 01:52:14.430]  That means sue for peace.
[01:52:15.789 --> 01:52:21.149]  You need to make deals like a lot of smart people are doing right now with the Trump administration and stop it.
[01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:23.069]  Can you see a lot of your bosses rolling over?
[01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:24.989]  And they're rolling over for real because they're smart.
[01:52:26.529 --> 01:52:27.949]  But a lot of you people...
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:29.859]  Are stalkers.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:33.020]  You spiritually really hate good people, and you know it.
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:37.180]  And you want to project onto people like me what you are, which is scum.
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:43.539]  But I metaphysically have a duty to tell you where you're at, and a duty to warn you.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:49.680]  And I will take no pleasure in your imprisonment.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.579]  But I will take a sense of relief from it.
[01:52:56.489 --> 01:53:02.789]  Not just so you can't persecute me and my family, but so scum like you can't continue to persecute others.
[01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:05.949]  I want you off of America and the world's back.
[01:53:07.810 --> 01:53:15.149]  I got a little more on this to hit, five more minutes than I promise.
[01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:18.250]  Doesn't matter, I got the fourth hour too, so I'm gonna get to everything.
[01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:24.229]  I said I would do some historic breakdowns of how Christmas has changed, and that's really important.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.220]  I'll do that at the start of the fourth hour.
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.939]  I've got to hit this nuclear war information.
[01:53:31.079 --> 01:53:32.079]  I didn't finish the key to it.
[01:53:32.859 --> 01:53:34.119]  I've got to hit Mayorkas.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.619]  Really running scared right now.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.779]  This is dramatic information coming up.
[01:53:40.819 --> 01:53:44.359]  But I've got five more minutes on this because this is Elon Musk derangement syndrome.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:46.039]  It's Donald Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:47.399]  It's Alex Jones derangement syndrome.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:47.819]  What is it?
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:52.119]  No, it's Anti-populist, anti-freedom derangement.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:55.920]  Because we won't roll over to these parasites playing so they can play God.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.640]  We won't become robots for them and just be their bitches.
[01:53:59.439 --> 01:54:01.579]  Instead, we're saying, move, bitch!
[01:54:01.979 --> 01:54:02.840]  Get out the way!
[01:54:03.079 --> 01:54:04.220]  Get out the way, bitch!
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:05.220]  Move out the way!
[01:54:05.659 --> 01:54:06.939]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:10.840]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.920]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:54:15.159 --> 01:54:17.399]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.000]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:24.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:26.000]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:32.500]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal, human trafficking, and sex slavery.
[01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:35.779]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.199]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.300]  We're going to get behind.
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.720]  What did the United Nations have to do with the health border crisis?
[01:54:41.899 --> 01:54:43.479]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:47.750]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:54:47.909 --> 01:54:49.210]  Again, by design.
[01:54:49.409 --> 01:54:50.890]  And so much more is happening.
[01:54:50.989 --> 01:54:51.930]  This is an exciting time.
[01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:54.109]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:58.189]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:54:58.329 --> 01:55:00.189]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:01.149]  So we make it easy.
[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:11.229]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word, to meet like-minded people, and support the InfoWard.

[01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:22.350]  And I personally love this one.
[01:55:22.569 --> 01:55:26.050]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:28.510]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:29.829]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:31.789]  And this will horrify.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:36.720]  Leftist, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall shaking and figuring walking on the street.
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:37.399]  Say, it's okay.
[01:55:37.859 --> 01:55:42.500]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:49.119]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:52.579]  And then of course there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.
[01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:54.920]  Trump won, I'm afraid.

[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:01.380]  I'd heard about CMOS being a superfood, our CMOS namely, but the folks are bigly saying, you're recommending all these supplements and that's great.

[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:21.380]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my god, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:23.369]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:57.010]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:57:57.970 --> 01:57:59.890]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:02.949]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:06.710]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:10.010]  Here's Democrat Congressman Richard Neal melting down.
[01:58:11.609 --> 01:58:14.130]  And a tweet changed all of it?
[01:58:15.329 --> 01:58:23.010]  Can you imagine what the next two years are going to be like if every time the Congress works its will and then there's a tweet?
[01:58:23.989 --> 01:58:32.810]  Or from an individual who has no official portfolio who threatens members on the Republican side with a primary and they succumb?
[01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:41.569]  This institution has a separate responsibility based upon the separation of powers.
[01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:46.449]  Members of Congress don't serve under presidents of the United States.
[01:58:48.090 --> 01:58:49.069]  And I can play it.
[01:58:49.130 --> 01:58:49.630]  You've seen them.
[01:58:49.810 --> 01:58:51.590]  I mean, we played them earlier in the week or last week.
[01:58:52.649 --> 01:59:03.090]  I've probably seen 50 clubs of Democrat Congress creatures, Congress critters, going, oh my God, not just Elon Musk, but the American people are putting pressure on us.
[01:59:03.829 --> 01:59:05.449]  We need a separation of powers.
[01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:25.920]  How is the electorate that got Trump elected, despite all the fraud, Putting pressure in Elon Musk as a citizen speaking out against you and saying we should read this bill and 95% of it getting cut out and their draconian martial law pandemic legislation.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.619]  They tried to get past the UN treaty.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.880]  It failed, so they just tried to ram that through last week.
[01:59:30.079 --> 01:59:31.100]  And they're pissed.
[01:59:31.539 --> 01:59:34.199]  The bill went from two feet tall to about an inch thick.
[01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:43.369]  And then they're trying to act like A tweet did it.
[01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:44.609]  No, we're pissed.
[01:59:45.529 --> 01:59:48.390]  Elon Musk is just riding that wave and doing a great job.
[01:59:48.949 --> 01:59:53.829]  But to act like it's just Elon Musk and it's all happening because of Elon Musk and it's just him and he's really the president.
[01:59:55.329 --> 02:00:02.850]  And they try to pretend like we didn't vote for Trump because he had Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbards and everybody else on board.
[02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:09.649]  And Trump says he figured out how he got his agenda blocked eight years ago and he's ready.
[02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:10.949]  And that's why they're scared.
[02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:15.510]  We can't have the American people influencing things.
[02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:25.930]  And what did the 300 million that we know of pay to Reuters alone to run dirty trick PR campaigns against Musk do?
[02:00:26.489 --> 02:00:35.170]  They're so discredited it backfired because people know if the corporate media has got the dogs loose on you, you must be good.
[02:00:39.369 --> 02:00:43.250]  Yes, your attacks on the liberty movement are making it worse for you.
[02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:45.189]  And see, I'm not Machiavelli.
[02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:51.569]  If I was a sick person, I wouldn't even explain this to the globalists because don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[02:00:51.789 --> 02:00:54.930]  But they could easily destroy us along with them.
[02:00:55.369 --> 02:00:57.789]  So we need to get them to stop.
[02:00:58.329 --> 02:00:59.810]  This is beyond destructive.
[02:00:59.810 --> 02:01:00.569]  It's crazy.
[02:01:02.569 --> 02:01:04.829]  So it is Musk derangement syndrome.
[02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:07.229]  It's anti-freedom derangement syndrome.
[02:01:10.239 --> 02:01:19.739]  And I've got a compilation here of the German media and the left politicians crying and saying he's influencing things here.
[02:01:19.859 --> 02:01:20.500]  He's criticizing.
[02:01:20.699 --> 02:01:21.340]  What did he criticize?
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:29.520]  They gave a woman a much longer prison sentence for criticizing the man that beat her up and raped her on the side of the alleyway.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.859]  And he's like, this is pure, because they keep doing it.
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.180]  It's in the news there every day.
[02:01:36.939 --> 02:01:49.130]  Same thing in France and Sweden and the UK. I don't have time to play the compilation.
[02:01:49.329 --> 02:01:49.989]  Add it in post.
[02:01:50.130 --> 02:01:52.729]  We're live now, but once we archive this to X, put a note.
[02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:55.670]  It's clip two.
[02:01:57.789 --> 02:01:59.289]  You know, I'm going to play this when we come back.
[02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:00.029]  I'm going to finish up.
[02:02:01.069 --> 02:02:01.750]  It's just...
[02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:03.170]  I got so many of these.
[02:02:03.369 --> 02:02:03.909]  It's just...
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:07.440]  Ridiculous.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:14.220]  They're like, look, Elon Musk has that the current German leadership is dangerous and needs to be voted out.
[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:17.039]  And look, a German woman is popular.
[02:02:17.039 --> 02:02:19.979]  She's getting hundreds of millions of views every few days.
[02:02:20.159 --> 02:02:21.420]  And she doesn't like it either.
[02:02:21.619 --> 02:02:22.779]  She needs to be silenced.
[02:02:22.939 --> 02:02:27.539]  And they're arresting people for mildly criticizing the government.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.460]  But see, now they've reached the point of they arrest her.
[02:02:29.739 --> 02:02:31.199]  By the way, she's on the show tomorrow.
[02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:33.369]  What's going to happen?
[02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:35.649]  It's going to make her a martyr, you dumbasses.
[02:02:37.569 --> 02:02:39.949]  So, it's a historic time.
[02:02:39.949 --> 02:02:46.390]  I'm going to finish up with this, and then I'm going to get to all the other news.
[02:02:46.489 --> 02:02:46.869]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.329 --> 02:03:01.970]  Over the weekend, I was thinking about just where the world is today and how fast freedom's growing, how much people are waking up everywhere, all the different anti-globalist winning elections all over the place, and how panicked the system is and the type of crap they're going to pull.
[02:03:03.690 --> 02:03:19.170]  And I want to do an update, more information to come in and finish up what I covered in the first hour on the promotion of the State Department and the National Security Advisor Sullivan, the Secretary of State Blinken, that Iran's going to sneak attack us or Israel with nukes.
[02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:21.130]  I mean, that's clearly preparation for a false flag.
[02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:22.010]  I'll hit that in a little while.
[02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:26.550]  Then the big Mayorkas news and Max Keiser, then I'll do the whole fourth hour on the other news I haven't hit.
[02:03:27.989 --> 02:03:28.310]  But...
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.720]  I was thinking about Elon Musk this over the weekend a lot.
[02:03:40.979 --> 02:03:50.899]  Because it was just like 20 hours a day, he's just posting and saying exactly what I would say.
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.020]  And it's not because I'm telling him what to say.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:54.020]  He sees the same thing.
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:56.159]  I mean, we're looking at the same thing.
[02:03:56.239 --> 02:04:00.159]  Like somebody asked, what color is this supplement bottle?
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:02.039]  You'd say, well, it's white and bronze.
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:03.119]  Anybody can see that.
[02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:03.779]  We're seeing the same thing.
[02:04:05.029 --> 02:04:11.430]  And that's why the left has to brainwash you and say, don't ask questions and don't do your own research, see all those headlines.
[02:04:12.449 --> 02:04:13.489]  Because they're a cult.
[02:04:13.689 --> 02:04:20.270]  They're saying there aren't X and Y chromosomes and women are just as strong as men in sports and just all this crap.
[02:04:22.789 --> 02:04:28.109]  But I was thinking about people that have been fighting the globalists for a long time.
[02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:31.149]  Some of them just came around recently and I love that.
[02:04:33.289 --> 02:04:35.670]  But a lot of them are just like, well, you know, he's rich and powerful.
[02:04:35.829 --> 02:04:37.210]  We can't trust Elon Musk.
[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:43.350]  And then I get criticized a lot by people for, you know, saying, thank God for Elon Musk.
[02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:48.289]  And then I thought about talking about it on air.
[02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:52.310]  And I was thinking about how many good things he's doing.
[02:04:53.329 --> 02:04:55.550]  And I'm like, I can't even do it justice.
[02:04:58.970 --> 02:05:00.109]  But that said...
[02:05:05.319 --> 02:05:35.960]  I need to do like a whole hour long tape report just to go through it because and then also there's some criticisms as well that I'm going to put in it but when I start thinking about all the good he's done my head explodes because it's just so much and then there's some bad but I see the angles what he's doing there but you can say potentially bad is my point and his thought is well if we don't dominate all this somebody else will and that's just the way the world works but Elon
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:45.619]  Musk is irrevocably, critically, mortally wounding the globalist operations.
[02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:50.979]  And he's fundamentally attacking their brainwashing mind virus, as he calls it.
[02:05:52.399 --> 02:05:57.800]  And you don't put that genie back in the bottle.
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:01.539]  And he's got the bad guys on all fronts attacking him.
[02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:05.439]  And he succeeded at everything he ever did.
[02:06:06.779 --> 02:06:09.640]  And now he's taking on the current power structure.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:17.279]  And he didn't come at them from some angle that was within their paradigm where he just wanted to get rid of them so he'd be in charge.
[02:06:17.739 --> 02:06:24.319]  He's attacking them from a pro-human, pro-human population, team humanity position that...
[02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:31.689]  He couldn't turn around and double back on if he was one of them.
[02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:39.529]  Because, again, you don't reverse the things he's doing.
[02:06:39.529 --> 02:06:42.569]  He's like Godzilla destroying Tokyo, but Tokyo is the new world order.
[02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:50.789]  So, that's where we're at.
[02:06:57.909 --> 02:07:05.569]  Musk has told them at the WEF and at the World Government Forum last year that your system is stagnating competition.
[02:07:05.909 --> 02:07:07.409]  It's cutting off resources.
[02:07:07.409 --> 02:07:08.810]  You're trying to depopulate people.
[02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:12.829]  And all the studies show that'll just cause giant uprisings and war.
[02:07:12.829 --> 02:07:19.930]  And you think you can survive a collapse of civilization and that your little corporate reservations of high-tech city-states are going to survive.
[02:07:20.029 --> 02:07:21.609]  You're going to get us all killed.
[02:07:24.739 --> 02:07:35.439]  All the research, industrial, societal, chemical, everything shows that the controlled collapse will not be controlled.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:43.840]  So even if you're for killing most of the people and getting rid of most of the people because you're a selfish globalist, your plan isn't going to work.
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:48.520]  So just from a functionality, Musk understands that.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:53.460]  I can't read his heart, but I can think second, third, fourth order.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:01.079]  And there's no angle.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:04.739]  People call it the three-dimensional chess.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:06.760]  There's no outcome.
[02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:18.039]  There's no scenario where what Elon Musk is doing helps the transhumanist Satan New World Order death cult.
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:26.739]  So That's where I'm at on that.
[02:08:27.239 --> 02:08:28.560]  People go, well, the brain chip.
[02:08:29.079 --> 02:08:31.939]  He's just trying to popularize that and commercialize it.
[02:08:32.539 --> 02:08:35.039]  The globalists have got it totally behind the scenes.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.500]  I don't want kids being forced to have it.
[02:08:38.579 --> 02:08:40.199]  I don't want people to be made to get it.
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:53.180]  But if I, God forbid, roll my car in a month and break my neck, I sure as hell hope Elon Musk has got this all done and ready to go, where they can go in for a surgery and two hours later get up.
[02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:56.430]  And your spine's fixed.
[02:08:56.670 --> 02:08:59.670]  And I got a couple chips in my spine and one in my brainstem.
[02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:01.750]  Sign me up.
[02:09:03.949 --> 02:09:05.510]  I'm 85. Have a stroke.
[02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:06.449]  Paralyzed on one side.
[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:06.949]  Go in.
[02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:07.590]  Surgery.
[02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:10.310]  Up and walking an hour later.
[02:09:10.449 --> 02:09:11.409]  Sign me up, baby.
[02:09:14.170 --> 02:09:19.409]  So, it's not technology itself that's bad.
[02:09:20.409 --> 02:09:23.869]  It's that it's being deployed in a bad way.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:32.500]  So, my uncle wouldn't be alive right now if he didn't have wires in his brain.
[02:09:33.399 --> 02:09:36.340]  From epilepsy, from a brutal motorcycle accident.
[02:09:36.979 --> 02:09:40.640]  He lives a good life at 71 years old.
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:42.319]  My dad's a younger brother.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.739]  So, okay, self-driving cars.
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:49.680]  It's like calculators.
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:54.399]  Texas Instruments, 1970. By the 80s, most people don't know how to do math anymore.
[02:09:55.170 --> 02:09:56.289]  It does make us weaker.
[02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:57.510]  It does make us lazier.
[02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:05.229]  You could say having cars replacing horses made us not as rugged.
[02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:08.149]  It's the process, so we have to have a debate about that.
[02:10:08.369 --> 02:10:10.710]  There are a lot of uses for self-driving cars.
[02:10:10.909 --> 02:10:14.310]  I don't want to force humans out of their position.
[02:10:15.569 --> 02:10:23.850]  I understand at a certain level it would be better if this never even got deployed because the way we operate as a society is so lazy and decadent.
[02:10:26.170 --> 02:10:28.890]  That it will displace human society.
[02:10:31.449 --> 02:10:32.750]  But it's coming out.
[02:10:32.949 --> 02:10:33.649]  It's going on.
[02:10:35.529 --> 02:10:37.710]  People bitching about him and Starlink.
[02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:40.229]  Oh my God, he's launched all these satellites.
[02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:46.170]  And they're posting that to X over their smartphone, over his satellites.
[02:10:46.409 --> 02:11:04.670]  It's just, I cannot sit there and be a hypocrite When I'm using all this and admitting it's got pitfalls and dangers, but we know that, and if we put our stamp of human control on it and design it and build it to empower us and make us stronger,
[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:07.130]  that's what humans do is control our environment.
[02:11:07.449 --> 02:11:09.510]  Then it's a good thing, not a bad thing.
[02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:16.770]  It's us and how we adopt it and how we use it and how the globalists are trying to force it that is bad.
[02:11:16.770 --> 02:11:18.989]  And so we need to have a discussion about that.
[02:11:21.869 --> 02:11:31.210]  But when it comes to promoting having more children, medical freedom, exposing the poison shots, he isn't promoting the carbon tax.
[02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:33.770]  He isn't promoting the universal basic income anymore.
[02:11:33.930 --> 02:11:34.890]  He's against it.
[02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:38.130]  He's awake now.
[02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:43.670]  Or maybe he was awake earlier but was still siding with them but sees they were going down and jumped over our team.
[02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:44.569]  Okay.
[02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:50.210]  The point is that he is irrevocably damaging them.
[02:11:53.779 --> 02:11:57.920]  What if Hillary Clinton, she's pure evil, she won't, came out and exposed the whole New World Order next week?
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:58.880]  Wouldn't you be happy she did?
[02:11:58.899 --> 02:12:01.140]  We'd never forgive her, we'd never trust her, but that'd be a good thing, right?
[02:12:01.739 --> 02:12:05.000]  Well, he was never, in her league, a bad person.
[02:12:05.699 --> 02:12:07.359]  I would never call him a bad person.
[02:12:08.279 --> 02:12:17.960]  And now he's totally in our camp, and no one is smashing the globalists in the information war like Elon Musk.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:18.859]  Period.
[02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:36.689]  So we work and we talk about having a mass awakening and promoting freedom versus tyranny and believing people are going to join us in that, even prominent people when they see what's happening, and I've talked about that for 30 years, and then it starts to happen in royal flush, in the ace of spades,
[02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:39.369]  and God is answering our prayers.
[02:12:41.369 --> 02:12:48.689]  And then we look a gift horse in the mouth and say, eh, like Pharisees saying it's not perfect.
[02:12:48.689 --> 02:12:50.010]  Well, you're not perfect either.
[02:12:51.850 --> 02:12:56.130]  So, I was thinking this weekend that I don't gush enough about Elon Musk.
[02:12:59.529 --> 02:13:05.430]  I mean, Elon Musk came in and said, you're not taking Alex Jones off X, and I'll sue you, and they backed off on that.
[02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:11.149]  He's actually delivering in the fight, specifically.
[02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:15.430]  And he's doing it in hundreds of other free speech cases I know of.
[02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:19.449]  He's spending billions for your free speech.
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:26.859]  Fighting for it, not just the 44 billion for X, saying it wasn't the cost of Twitter, it was the cost of restoring free speech.
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:34.159]  And I sit there and watch people criticizing him with tens of millions of views, not being shadow banned, not being blocked.
[02:13:35.619 --> 02:13:36.060]  Good.
[02:13:36.899 --> 02:13:38.039]  That's good, that's healthy.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:41.220]  And I don't mind people that lie about me and attack me.
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:44.640]  Because I have a right to really say what I have to say.
[02:13:44.699 --> 02:13:54.140]  And those people send me their viewers and listeners where they can actually hear what I say and see what I do versus the little out of context things that are just flat out lies.
[02:13:56.899 --> 02:14:03.600]  So, Trump is already overperforming what I thought he'd be able to do this far in.
[02:14:04.399 --> 02:14:07.720]  Elon Musk is grand slamming it.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:11.000]  You're grand slamming it.
[02:14:11.079 --> 02:14:12.640]  Tucker Carlson's knocking it out of the park.
[02:14:13.079 --> 02:14:14.380]  Joe Rogan's knocking it out of the park.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.060]  RFK Jr.'s knocking it out of the park.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.500]  And countless others are.
[02:14:17.619 --> 02:14:21.279]  And I just want to say thank you, God, for Tucker Carlson.
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:24.180]  Thank you, God, for Senator Paul.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.060]  Thank you, God, for Ron Paul.
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:28.260]  Thank you, God, for Tulsi Gabbards.
[02:14:30.579 --> 02:14:33.199]  Thank you, God, for the activist listeners of this show.
[02:14:33.939 --> 02:14:35.539]  Thank you, God, for Elon Musk.
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:47.180]  Because We have gone so far towards defeating these people.
[02:14:47.319 --> 02:14:48.800]  We are so close.
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:54.979]  But just getting the globalists off our back is only one piece of this.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.180]  We then have to build an alternate future and an alternate plan.
[02:15:00.539 --> 02:15:01.760]  We've got to work hard.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:02.960]  We've got to be professional.
[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.159]  We've got to be truthful.
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:06.180]  We've got to be engaged.
[02:15:06.579 --> 02:15:07.680]  We've got to be humble.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:12.399]  And we do have to have a discussion about all of this.
[02:15:13.159 --> 02:15:18.439]  You know, the government's going to come out and start saying to join the military, you've got to have brain chips.
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:21.960]  Most military already has chips, just because you didn't know that's secret.
[02:15:22.479 --> 02:15:23.239]  Let's come out.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:27.380]  I first broke it 20 plus years ago, but now it's ubiquitous.
[02:15:28.779 --> 02:15:29.100]  And...
[02:15:33.970 --> 02:15:39.329]  We have to have a decentralization of the information so people see the big picture.
[02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:44.010]  And then I believe, and I've seen it and I know it, that people will make the right decision.
[02:15:44.130 --> 02:15:47.170]  The vast majority of us, the knowledge of the crowd, will make the right decision.
[02:15:47.289 --> 02:15:50.250]  Well, is Elon Musk pushing chips on kids?
[02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.890]  No.
[02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:56.229]  Elon Musk is trying to stop the chemical and physical castration and destruction of little boys and girls.
[02:16:00.189 --> 02:16:18.899]  And then he's trying to create instrumentality I mean, look at Trump's response to $300 million being given to Reuters to attack Musk.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.260]  It's their propaganda.
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:21.500]  That's not strong enough.
[02:16:21.699 --> 02:16:29.359]  Hey, Trump, that's illegal to have the government give $300 million through agencies to private corporations to lie about people.
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:38.170]  If Reuters wants to lie about Elon Musk, they can do that all day themselves, but they can't take government money and do it.
[02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:40.209]  So put that back on screen.
[02:16:40.409 --> 02:16:44.129]  I mean, look, even Trump's response isn't one-tenth as hardcore as it should be.
[02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:48.069]  And Trump said, you know, Musk brands Reuters pay propaganda.
[02:16:48.329 --> 02:16:50.729]  No, Musk, it's way worse than that, and you know that.
[02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:59.250]  And look at that weak RT headline.
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:04.120]  News that they were pushed to investigate him, they were funded on record.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:04.799]  It was illegal.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:07.500]  My God.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:21.139]  But because the tyranny is so strong, so intense, it sounds crazy.
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:27.459]  Five months ago, Biden signs an executive order.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:34.559]  The Pentagon puts out a new policy manual saying we're authorized for martial law, civil unrest, killing U.S. citizens.
[02:17:35.319 --> 02:17:46.399]  While they ran around on the news saying Trump's going to kill citizens of the military, and I had to harp and call the Trump people and do dozens of shows until Trump came out and talked about it, and then the Democrats shut their lying mouths.
[02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:50.309]  And I know why the campaign was telling Trump, probably don't talk about this.
[02:17:50.350 --> 02:17:53.389]  It sounds crazy to say Biden's got orders to kill U.S. citizens.
[02:17:53.610 --> 02:17:56.750]  And I'm like, they're saying you're going to do it while they're actually setting it up.
[02:17:57.069 --> 02:17:58.250]  You need to get ahead of this.
[02:17:58.350 --> 02:17:59.370]  And Trump did it.
[02:17:59.649 --> 02:18:04.270]  And Trump came out on the drones and said it's the Pentagon and Biden's doing this to terrorize people.
[02:18:04.409 --> 02:18:06.170]  And they shut up hours later.
[02:18:08.530 --> 02:18:13.229]  Just because what the globalists are doing sounds crazy doesn't mean we don't talk about it.
[02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:18.649]  Not just, oh, they smuggled in and disappeared 325,000 missing children.
[02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:20.030]  Senate report way worse than that.
[02:18:20.409 --> 02:18:22.829]  You don't just say you're going to shut the border down.
[02:18:22.930 --> 02:18:25.670]  You say we're going to find the kids and we're going to prosecute.
[02:18:26.209 --> 02:18:29.170]  And now Trump has said that at home and said that.
[02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:38.670]  Who do you think on air and off air contacted them and said, you have a moral authority to do this.
[02:18:38.809 --> 02:18:40.590]  I'm sure you're going to, right?
[02:18:44.739 --> 02:18:46.520]  Plus, it'll bring down these globalists.
[02:18:48.450 --> 02:18:50.969]  Now, why do I explain to you how I know all this?
[02:18:51.510 --> 02:18:58.010]  Because I want you to get the same perspective, or from your own life and experience, better perspective than me.
[02:18:58.110 --> 02:19:02.889]  I learn from you all the time, and I want to beat them, and I know how to beat them.
[02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:05.090]  Why do you think they want me off the air?
[02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:06.430]  Why do you know?
[02:19:06.510 --> 02:19:07.129]  You know.
[02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:08.510]  We don't have the actual number.
[02:19:08.889 --> 02:19:12.290]  They say $326 million just suing me the last seven years.
[02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:14.350]  That's in court documents, followed by them.
[02:19:15.649 --> 02:19:17.270]  I bet it's a billion bucks.
[02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:20.950]  I mean, some days thousands of articles attacking me.
[02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:23.530]  Some nights every news channel lying about me.
[02:19:23.969 --> 02:19:25.850]  I mean, damn, did we hit a nerve.
[02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:31.950]  We should all be asking, what did this guy say that's got them running around like a beehive going crazy?
[02:19:33.850 --> 02:19:35.670]  Wow, this guy really has their number.
[02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:36.690]  He's really got to them.
[02:19:36.729 --> 02:19:37.530]  What is he saying?
[02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:40.809]  Well, you tune in and it's tomorrow's news today.
[02:19:41.430 --> 02:19:42.569]  They tune in.
[02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:49.370]  Most people don't study the CIA and the State Department and NATO and the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group.
[02:19:50.709 --> 02:19:53.709]  Most people don't study all the different secret energy sources.
[02:19:53.850 --> 02:19:54.549]  Most people don't study.
[02:19:54.649 --> 02:19:55.870]  I study it all.
[02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:57.629]  This is what I do.
[02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:00.629]  And I've got their number.
[02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:01.549]  I got their name.
[02:20:01.690 --> 02:20:02.590]  I got their what?
[02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:03.329]  Their ass.
[02:20:05.549 --> 02:20:07.190]  And it is a distinct pleasure.
[02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:09.450]  That they hate me.
[02:20:09.989 --> 02:20:13.149]  It is a distinct, great achievement.
[02:20:13.909 --> 02:20:15.290]  I wouldn't call it pride.
[02:20:15.430 --> 02:20:16.309]  I'm not a prideful person.
[02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:18.190]  I don't feel good about myself.
[02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:20.629]  I feel good about stopping bad guys.
[02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:22.590]  I feel satisfied.
[02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:23.590]  Big difference from pride.
[02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:26.170]  But I get extreme satisfaction.
[02:20:26.409 --> 02:20:27.450]  Better than the best food.
[02:20:27.649 --> 02:20:28.850]  Better than the best sex.
[02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:32.590]  Better than the best starlight gazing.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:40.459]  I get the greatest pleasure in my life having evil hate my ass.
[02:20:41.319 --> 02:20:43.600]  Because that means I'm hurting them.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.200]  And that's why I explain to listeners.
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.440]  Because you need the right perspective in my view.
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:55.920]  I'm not telling you what you got to think.
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:58.920]  I'm saying it's my opinion, well educated, well informed.
[02:21:00.739 --> 02:21:02.520]  That most people have an ass backwards.
[02:21:02.719 --> 02:21:09.420]  They think getting no friction and just going through life and going bowling and watching movies and eating good food and watching Netflix is fun.
[02:21:09.579 --> 02:21:11.079]  The people that do that are miserable.
[02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:14.819]  And they're always trying to do something new because they're not...
[02:21:14.819 --> 02:21:24.899]  The most satisfied people do a lot of stuff and have fun as well, but are involved in their community, involved in society, and are fighting bad guys.
[02:21:25.629 --> 02:21:31.610]  Because when we don't make it a goal in society to fight bad people, bad people take over.
[02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:33.930]  So you're designed to fight evil.
[02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:37.409]  If you've got your head screwed on straight.
[02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:38.430]  If you're pointed at God.
[02:21:38.989 --> 02:21:40.950]  And so it isn't work to fight evil.
[02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.530]  I jumped out of bed.
[02:21:45.829 --> 02:21:47.469]  I woke up, it was like 4.45.
[02:21:47.889 --> 02:21:50.030]  I didn't go to bed until about 11.30.
[02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:52.250]  I like to sleep six, seven hours.
[02:21:53.219 --> 02:21:57.239]  But last few months especially, I wake up until the alarm clock hadn't gone off.
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:21:59.280]  I've got it in the other room.
[02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:04.680]  And I get up and got like in the hallway.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:08.079]  And I get up to go see what time it is.
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:10.180]  And it's like, you know, 4.15 or whatever.
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:12.440]  I'm like, I really should go back to sleep.
[02:22:12.459 --> 02:22:13.319]  No, I'm not going back to sleep.
[02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:14.979]  I want to fight the tyrants.
[02:22:16.659 --> 02:22:17.020]  And...
[02:22:19.629 --> 02:22:21.930]  I've never been a big, big sleeper, but I enjoy my sleep.
[02:22:22.149 --> 02:22:23.049]  Not now.
[02:22:24.129 --> 02:22:27.409]  Because fighting the tyrants is so important.
[02:22:29.209 --> 02:22:40.889]  So, it is not a job to do this.
[02:22:43.489 --> 02:22:44.750]  It's life force.
[02:22:44.969 --> 02:22:45.989]  It's survival instinct.
[02:22:46.530 --> 02:22:48.170]  And I know I harp on this.
[02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:50.770]  And I've got so many articles and so much news to hit.
[02:22:50.850 --> 02:22:52.129]  But this is really fundamental.
[02:22:53.069 --> 02:22:54.549]  I am so alive.
[02:22:54.549 --> 02:22:55.690]  I am so focused.
[02:22:56.010 --> 02:23:01.010]  I'm so empowered more than ever.
[02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.809]  It's exponential.
[02:23:02.149 --> 02:23:04.190]  And people are seeing it and feeling it.
[02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:05.850]  Not just me.
[02:23:05.989 --> 02:23:07.069]  You are feeling it.
[02:23:07.149 --> 02:23:07.989]  I see it everywhere.
[02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:11.250]  Because people are rediscovering who they are.
[02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:12.889]  They're rediscovering their destiny.
[02:23:14.969 --> 02:23:17.309]  And evil is scared, and they should be.
[02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:21.030]  Because no matter what they do now, they will fail.
[02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:24.950]  For some of us, it's not going to be fun.
[02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:30.069]  Their tactic is take out the leadership of the human resistance against the satanic forces.
[02:23:31.350 --> 02:23:39.690]  But that's okay, because God put us here as a learning experience, and the journey is the destination.
[02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:51.809]  So I mentioned this German compilation of the news, straight-faced, panicking that how dare Elon Musk criticize our tyranny, as if people are going to watch this and think, yeah, how dare him?
[02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:55.690]  No, they're like, yeah, he's right, you're bad, you deserve to be criticized, here it is.
[02:23:56.030 --> 02:24:00.370]  Is Elon Musk trying to interfere in Germany's upcoming election?
[02:24:00.610 --> 02:24:02.850]  Many are saying this tweet shows he is.
[02:24:03.350 --> 02:24:18.090]  On his PlatformX, Donald Trump's soon-to-be-efficiency czar wrote,"...only the AFD can save Germany," above a video criticizing CDU party leader Friedrich Merz for refusing to work with the far-right AFD party.
[02:24:18.250 --> 02:24:18.809]  The result?
[02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:25.590]  Jubilation from the AFD. Their leader Alice Weidel thanked Musk and wished him and Trump a Merry Christmas.
[02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:28.969]  While among most other politicians there was outrage.
[02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:51.489]  The AFD is currently polling in second place ahead of February's election, but other parties have ruled out cooperating with it.
[02:24:51.790 --> 02:25:02.530]  The anti-immigrant party has long been in favor of Elon Musk, although they have also protested against the Tesla Gigafactory in Germany, saying electric cars were the wrong way to go.
[02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:10.530]  But this tweet and the reaction to it show how worried some here in Germany are about outside interference in the election.
[02:25:10.770 --> 02:25:16.110]  Meanwhile, Chancellor Olaf Scholz commented in his usual understated tone.
[02:25:23.129 --> 02:25:29.790]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:31.569]  The Deep State sued the hell out of him.
[02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:32.989]  We're going to our guests in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[02:25:33.069 --> 02:25:33.409]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:37.579]  And They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:44.139]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:25:44.299 --> 02:25:48.139]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:51.100]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[02:25:51.319 --> 02:25:52.899]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:54.780]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:55.940]  And we're finally winning.
[02:25:56.159 --> 02:26:03.040]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you.
[02:26:03.069 --> 02:26:07.469]  To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:26:07.809 --> 02:26:17.649]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[02:26:18.149 --> 02:26:19.170]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:26:19.290 --> 02:26:25.430]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:33.180]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:34.879]  The supplements are there.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:35.680]  They're great.
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:37.020]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:38.379]  He's put everything into it he has.
[02:26:38.459 --> 02:26:39.040]  They're incredible.
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:49.000]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:26:49.079 --> 02:26:50.299]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:26:51.139 --> 02:26:52.360]  Please support us.
[02:26:52.559 --> 02:26:54.579]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.
[02:26:54.659 --> 02:26:55.379]  There's a new sale.
[02:26:55.579 --> 02:26:57.059]  Everything is 30% off.
[02:26:57.239 --> 02:27:06.680]  Next Level Foundational Energy, all fluoride-free toothpaste, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, CoQ10, and Corseton Max that are high-end Corseton and CoQ10 for 40% off.
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:09.100]  Or try these other amazing products.
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.319]  Ultimate Longevity Pack for 50% off.
[02:27:12.459 --> 02:27:13.239]  A big sale.
[02:27:13.379 --> 02:27:14.479]  And my dad...
[02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:21.110]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[02:27:21.309 --> 02:27:23.409]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:26.110]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:27:26.649 --> 02:27:30.610]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:32.270]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[02:27:32.430 --> 02:27:33.049]  He's a fighter.
[02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:33.989]  Hell, he's my dad.
[02:27:34.170 --> 02:27:35.129]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:27:35.329 --> 02:27:36.750]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:27:37.409 --> 02:27:44.950]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:27:45.129 --> 02:27:47.790]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:47.930 --> 02:27:48.889]  It's about my parents.
[02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:54.969]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:58.489]  So, please support the Info War today.
[02:27:58.829 --> 02:28:00.590]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:03.569]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:08.329]  And if 5% of the millions watching me go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:13.969]  But it's less than one half or 1% to ever buy anything from drjonesnacros.com and the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:28:14.030 --> 02:28:16.770]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[02:28:20.799 --> 02:28:22.879]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[02:28:23.159 --> 02:28:26.100]  Max Keiser kind of looks like a handsome elf, doesn't he?
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:29.899]  Actual elf on TV with us right now.
[02:28:33.090 --> 02:28:34.950]  We're going to go back to him in a minute.
[02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:40.129]  Look, I kind of pontificated on the information war a lot in the first few hours.
[02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:47.290]  I'll be hosting the whole fourth hour live today, and I will get to the key World War III Iran nuclear false flag news that I haven't hit.
[02:28:47.590 --> 02:28:51.489]  I will get to Mayorkas running scared on the human trafficking, the biggest developments yet.
[02:28:52.239 --> 02:29:04.920]  I will get into the propaganda of the new modern Christmas system and how understanding that, you understand how these globalist fads and trends work so that they can't get their new societal takeovers in place.
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.180]  It's all coming up and so much more next hour.
[02:29:09.639 --> 02:29:16.319]  But I saw this being hyped the last few weeks and it kind of hit a crescendo today.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:21.200]  And he's very gracious to come on on short notice, Max Kaiser.
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:27.319]  And here's the Wall Street Journal, a looming threat to Bitcoin, the risk of quantum hack.
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:37.219]  Now, again, if you have computers billions of times faster exponentially, and we're right there, could they hack into anything?
[02:29:37.579 --> 02:29:39.739]  Well, certainly a lot of the current systems.
[02:29:40.799 --> 02:29:41.719]  And so...
[02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:52.030]  We're good to go.
[02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:06.950]  Yeah, hey, Alex Jones, Merry Christmas.
[02:30:07.149 --> 02:30:07.829]  Sure, sure.
[02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:11.270]  You know, as I said before, Bitcoin is designed to be attacked.
[02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:20.209]  It invites attacks because that means that there's more computational power involved in the Bitcoin network, which makes it more secure, which means it attracts more capital.
[02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:30.950]  But to the point of the quantum computer hack Welcome to my show!
[02:30:42.509 --> 02:30:50.110]  Those coins, you have to be part of an audit that happens every 10 minutes of the Bitcoin network, and you throw a lot of computational power at it.
[02:30:50.469 --> 02:31:01.409]  Now, if this computational power were to suddenly go up with a quantum computer, the amount of energy or computational power you would need to get through the audit to get the Bitcoin goes up as well.
[02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:05.540]  So it matches whatever the network throws out in terms of computational power.
[02:31:05.719 --> 02:31:14.559]  This difficulty adjustment that adjusts every two weeks or approximately two weeks as part of the protocol goes up to meet that threat.
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.200]  So it's already built into the protocol.
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:17.239]  This is a non-event.
[02:31:17.399 --> 02:31:20.319]  This is the Wall Street Journal, FUD, fear, uncertainty, doubt.
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:20.959]  It's nonsense.
[02:31:21.219 --> 02:31:24.200]  And the opposite, of course, is also true, Alex.
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:27.100]  Remember back when China said they were going to ban Bitcoin?
[02:31:27.829 --> 02:31:34.010]  Well, a lot of the network was in China and the entire network shrunk by 40% in a matter of days.
[02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.809]  What happened then?
[02:31:35.010 --> 02:31:43.729]  The difficulty adjustment sank down to a low level, required less computational power to complete the audit and get the coins.
[02:31:44.079 --> 02:31:45.540]  And nothing changed.
[02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:50.280]  The entire network went flawlessly, as it has since 2009, never been interrupted.
[02:31:50.579 --> 02:31:59.299]  So this is a nonsense story from the Wall Street Journal, who, of course, hates Bitcoin because it makes them look silly because they've been wrong about it now for 15 years.
[02:32:00.399 --> 02:32:02.479]  It reminds me of Paul Krugman, who just retired.
[02:32:02.719 --> 02:32:11.719]  He's an incredible comic, unintentional comic I wish he wouldn't have, saying the internet will end up having almost no consequence like the fax machine.
[02:32:12.219 --> 02:32:21.020]  Just basically everything he says is wrong, but just as a layperson, Everything is like an arms race in science, in culture, in media.
[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:35.659]  And if Bitcoin is dominant, which it is, and it's all about computational power, then that states, just in the law of innovation, that it will always be at the cutting edge of computational power and crowdsourcing computational power.
[02:32:35.659 --> 02:32:45.399]  And so that actually some type of quantum computer attack would end up basically just accelerating the overall build-out of the Bitcoin economy.
[02:32:47.149 --> 02:32:48.190]  A hundred percent.
[02:32:48.430 --> 02:32:49.350]  It makes it more secure.
[02:32:49.629 --> 02:32:51.170]  It increases its dominance.
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:33:03.270]  And with added security means that more capital feels comfortable flowing out of stocks, bonds, real estate, the art market into Bitcoin as the ultimate store of wealth, as the ultimate perfect money.
[02:33:03.389 --> 02:33:06.469]  And it's all on a vector that nobody can stop.
[02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:07.530]  It's unconfiscatable.
[02:33:07.709 --> 02:33:08.329]  It's uncensorable.
[02:33:08.489 --> 02:33:09.649]  You and I can do a transaction.
[02:33:09.829 --> 02:33:20.700]  When Julian Assange was pulled up in the Embassy in London, the only way they could get funds to Julian Assange was with Bitcoin, because PayPal banned them, the credit cards banned them, they shut them down.
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:21.500]  All kinds.
[02:33:21.639 --> 02:33:22.940]  Remember the truckers in Canada?
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:25.920]  They were shut out of their bank accounts, the Canadian government.
[02:33:26.239 --> 02:33:29.040]  Well, the only way they could get some funds was through Bitcoin.
[02:33:29.379 --> 02:33:33.239]  It's kind of like P2P file swapping for music, where you can't shut it down.
[02:33:33.379 --> 02:33:35.940]  So what happened was the music industry had to change, Alex.
[02:33:36.159 --> 02:33:42.100]  They went from a model where they sell individual tunes I've been around for generations.
[02:33:42.100 --> 02:33:48.040]  They had to go to a streaming model because that was in response to Napster and P2P file swapping.
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:50.120]  Well, Bitcoin is similar.
[02:33:50.319 --> 02:33:52.639]  It's file swapping of money, essentially.
[02:33:53.239 --> 02:33:55.399]  And so central banks, they can't compete with it.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:56.739]  Governments can't compete with it.
[02:33:56.860 --> 02:33:58.399]  The fiat money can't compete with it.
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:00.079]  So they're going to have to change.
[02:34:00.239 --> 02:34:11.239]  They're changing their business model, and we see that happening in El Salvador, where the government realizes that the 21st century will be decentralized, and that includes money, and they're developing a new governance model.
[02:34:11.379 --> 02:34:16.899]  And I would point your attention to do a search right now for El Salvador Christmas Village.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:20.739]  You'll see that in Salvador this week, the Christmas festivities are brilliant.
[02:34:20.979 --> 02:34:21.780]  People are happy.
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:27.340]  Contrast that to Germany, which is under a fiat money system where it's become a complete nightmare.
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:32.979]  Contrast that to New York City, which is under a fiat money system, the U.S. dollar, where they're lighting people on fire on the subway.
[02:34:33.139 --> 02:34:34.659]  That doesn't sound like Christmas spirit to me.
[02:34:34.969 --> 02:34:36.290]  Now look what's happening in El Salvador.
[02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:37.489]  People are in the streets.
[02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:38.110]  They're jubilant.
[02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:40.569]  It's the safest country in the hemisphere.
[02:34:40.829 --> 02:34:43.170]  It'll soon be the safest country in the world.
[02:34:43.549 --> 02:34:51.930]  President Bukele is on the cutting edge of making Bitcoin in El Salvador the de facto money that will run the economy.
[02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:59.319]  And the goal is to have every Salvadoran enjoy the richest, Bitcoin per capita ratio in the world.
[02:34:59.479 --> 02:35:04.440]  Every one of the 7 million Salvadorans has approximately $500 of Bitcoin in their name.
[02:35:04.579 --> 02:35:07.040]  We're going to try and get that to the highest level in the world.
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:11.600]  And we're aggressively buying Bitcoin in our strategic reserve fund.
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:19.180]  And that's going to be the story in 2025. Aggressive Bitcoin acquisition, decentralization of power, reinventing the nation state.
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:23.940]  El Salvador, the safest nation in the world with the most dynamic charismatic leader in the world.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:27.239]  I invite you again to come to El Salvador and see for yourself, Alex.
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:30.819]  Since you mentioned that, I wasn't going to bring myself up.
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:33.000]  You and the president inviting me is very gracious.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.059]  If you notice, they tried to shut us down again two weeks ago.
[02:35:37.219 --> 02:35:38.399]  They're constantly filing stuff.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:40.420]  We've beaten them three times in the last six months.
[02:35:40.719 --> 02:35:41.860]  There's more hearings come up.
[02:35:41.959 --> 02:35:45.379]  As soon as I know the future of Infowars, and we should know by the middle of January...
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:47.200]  I will be coming to El Salvador.
[02:35:47.399 --> 02:35:48.840]  You let me know the time once I can.
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:53.600]  I am not disrespecting you or the president and his offer and his invitation.
[02:35:53.639 --> 02:35:58.159]  And I thank you and I cannot wait because I hear it's amazing and I will be in El Salvador.
[02:35:58.319 --> 02:35:59.399]  I'll spend at least a week there.
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  So look for that.
[02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.159]  Now let's shift gears out of me if it's not that important to this.
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:17.780]  So, Forbes leaked...
[02:36:33.899 --> 02:36:36.000]  What does this say?
[02:36:36.299 --> 02:36:40.530]  Max Keiser It says that Wall Street has given up trying to fight Bitcoin.
[02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:46.569]  And the amount of money that's flowing into the Bitcoin ETF is the fastest in history, far exceeding gold.
[02:36:46.750 --> 02:36:47.409]  So let's stop.
[02:36:47.530 --> 02:36:49.229]  It's what you said a few months ago and a few weeks ago.
[02:36:49.290 --> 02:36:51.989]  You said it's past escape velocity.
[02:36:52.090 --> 02:36:53.829]  It already happened years ago, but now it's being recognized.
[02:36:54.090 --> 02:36:57.850]  And so there has been global Bitcoin capitulation by the establishment.
[02:36:58.989 --> 02:36:59.590]  Absolutely.
[02:36:59.930 --> 02:37:01.870]  And it's demonetizing gold.
[02:37:01.989 --> 02:37:07.549]  People are selling their Bitcoin ETF and their gold ETF, and they're buying Bitcoin instead.
[02:37:07.729 --> 02:37:18.809]  Senator Lummis over in Wyoming has suggested that the United States of America sell their 8,000 tons of gold in Fort Knox and buy Bitcoin because she wants the United States to be in a Bitcoin reserve.
[02:37:19.290 --> 02:37:20.690]  Sovereign wealth funds are buying Bitcoin.
[02:37:21.299 --> 02:37:22.299]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:37:22.319 --> 02:37:23.879]  How big is it that Trump's all in?
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:26.280]  And then I know there's other countries that are going all in as well.
[02:37:26.399 --> 02:37:29.360]  So talk about who's going all in and what you see the trends being.
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:33.059]  Well, the U.S. and Trump is definitely going all in.
[02:37:33.139 --> 02:37:37.420]  They've said they want to buy a million Bitcoin for the America Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:43.840]  And that, of course, would catapult the price up to the two, three, four million dollars per Bitcoin, which I would be happy to see myself.
[02:37:43.979 --> 02:37:45.459]  And so would a lot of other Bitcoiners.
[02:37:45.659 --> 02:37:50.479]  But this is triggering what I call the global hash war or the global Bitcoin war or World War Bitcoin.
[02:37:51.409 --> 02:37:53.950]  Back in the 60s, we had the space race.
[02:37:54.149 --> 02:37:56.530]  We competed with Russia to get to space.
[02:37:56.930 --> 02:38:00.809]  Now it's the Bitcoin race, where countries are trying to accumulate the most Bitcoin.
[02:38:01.209 --> 02:38:03.149]  Russia will soon be announcing they're buying Bitcoin.
[02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:04.350]  China's been buying Bitcoin.
[02:38:04.569 --> 02:38:06.670]  The Middle East has been buying Bitcoin aggressively.
[02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:07.969]  We'll hear about that very soon.
[02:38:08.149 --> 02:38:10.850]  So this is the new prima franca of the 21st century.
[02:38:10.989 --> 02:38:13.010]  He who has the Bitcoin makes the rules.
[02:38:13.469 --> 02:38:15.950]  It's the new El Dorado.
[02:38:16.129 --> 02:38:17.110]  It's the future.
[02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:23.899]  And as you've been saying for over 12 years or so, or 13 years, The dips are profit-taking?
[02:38:24.299 --> 02:38:26.299]  Because if you look at the long-term graph, you're absolutely right.
[02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:34.700]  Well, if you go from $1, when we first started talking about it on your show, Al, to $2, $3, $5 million, it's not a straight line, right?
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:35.420]  It's going to be volatile.
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:39.120]  But I'll take the volatility because I'm going from $1 to $5 million.
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:40.879]  I'll accept a little volatility.
[02:38:41.379 --> 02:38:44.780]  Anyone who's held it for four years or more has never lost a penny.
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.920]  It's compounding right now at about 60% a year, and that should continue for the next several years.
[02:38:50.559 --> 02:38:52.540]  So the dips are buying opportunities.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.719]  If you see something that you like, you want to buy it on sale.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:05.200]  I mean, this is a great lesson from Warren Buffett, you know, who said, look, I love it when my stocks go down because I have a huge confidence that...
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  And he's basically all in cash right now.
[02:39:07.319 --> 02:39:08.520]  Why isn't he more in Bitcoin?
[02:39:09.629 --> 02:39:12.389]  Well, because it's a great mystery.
[02:39:12.549 --> 02:39:12.670]  Why?
[02:39:12.809 --> 02:39:15.590]  Because some people just don't get it, like a Peter Schiff.
[02:39:15.709 --> 02:39:16.510]  He just doesn't get it.
[02:39:16.709 --> 02:39:17.989]  Warren Buffen doesn't get it.
[02:39:18.069 --> 02:39:19.649]  Nassim Taleb doesn't get it.
[02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:21.489]  Paul Krugman doesn't get it.
[02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:27.389]  A lot of people just don't understand it because it's such an evolutionary step change.
[02:39:27.549 --> 02:39:30.309]  Yeah, just like Paul Krugman didn't understand the internet was going to be big.
[02:39:31.379 --> 02:39:31.739]  Right.
[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:33.659]  The internet took a lot of people by surprise.
[02:39:33.799 --> 02:39:38.040]  But, you know, sometimes evolution takes a twist and a turn and it goes in a different direction.
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:42.420]  I remember being like six years old and my dad, he didn't call it the internet.
[02:39:42.559 --> 02:39:44.100]  He called it whatever the government network was.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:50.399]  He said, you watch within a decade, we'll all be communicating with handheld devices over the ARPANET or whatever it was called.
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:51.100]  He was right.
[02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.450]  Right.
[02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:54.489]  And these types of major changes.
[02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:59.770]  And I think with Bitcoin, it's such a huge change that it's really difficult for people to wrap their minds around.
[02:39:59.889 --> 02:40:04.329]  But you have to equate it with things like fire or the light bulb or the printing press.
[02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:07.229]  It's a complete reinvention of money, as we know it.
[02:40:07.290 --> 02:40:08.569]  And in fact, it's perfect money.
[02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:14.709]  And it satisfies an aesthetic need that we all have as human beings to have a common aesthetic appreciation of what's beautiful.
[02:40:15.049 --> 02:40:18.170]  And the Bitcoin protocol, you could say, is the Sistine Chapel of money.
[02:40:18.350 --> 02:40:20.209]  People just respond to it aesthetically.
[02:40:20.350 --> 02:40:21.030]  It's quite gorgeous.
[02:40:21.329 --> 02:40:24.049]  And that gives you the ability to travel through time and space.
[02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:25.270]  That's what money is.
[02:40:25.370 --> 02:40:27.610]  It gives you the ability to travel through time and space.
[02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:35.709]  I can travel from village to village or town or town with my shiny object, my gold or my Bitcoin, and I can interact with people.
[02:40:35.850 --> 02:40:37.329]  That means I can travel through space.
[02:40:37.729 --> 02:40:45.010]  Or I can put my Bitcoin in my gold wallet or my gold in my pocket and five years later I can pull it out and I can do the exact same thing.
[02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:46.450]  So I'm traveling through time.
[02:40:46.610 --> 02:40:47.129]  No, I understand.
[02:40:47.129 --> 02:40:48.549]  So let's stop right there.
[02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:49.350]  It's a...
[02:40:50.459 --> 02:40:53.340]  Way to transmit value through time, time travel.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:59.559]  So I remember the shows three and a half years ago, everybody else was saying Trump was doomed, America was doomed.
[02:40:59.879 --> 02:41:02.299]  You and I were saying, no, he's going to come back bigger than ever.
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:04.360]  He's going to end up being the president again.
[02:41:04.659 --> 02:41:09.079]  You were talking about Bitcoin and all this innovation and how the whole globalist model was going to be swept away.
[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:10.840]  You were saying they're done, they're done.
[02:41:10.959 --> 02:41:12.719]  I remember listeners thinking, man, we're getting our ass kicked.
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:15.379]  Max, Kaiser, Alex, you're being too optimistic.
[02:41:15.379 --> 02:41:18.620]  I just played clips earlier where I was predicting this years ago.
[02:41:19.059 --> 02:41:23.620]  So how were you able to so accurately predict that the globalist order was in so much trouble?
[02:41:23.899 --> 02:41:25.760]  Obviously, Elon Musk has seen it.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:28.659]  He's now jumped on the bandwagon, which I'm totally fine with.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:30.500]  He's causing them irrevocable damage.
[02:41:30.719 --> 02:41:33.079]  So, I mean, I just think it's amazing.
[02:41:33.219 --> 02:41:38.079]  But can you speak to where the old order is, the different blocks, and then what you see coming out of that?
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:41.020]  Obviously, the bad guys don't ever give up.
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:47.940]  I'm really concerned with them trying to trigger a full nuclear war or a big cyber outage they launched to blame on Russia or something.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:50.940]  I don't see them giving up is my concern.
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:54.319]  The news is so good everywhere with the human awakening and Bitcoin.
[02:41:54.319 --> 02:41:55.360]  I totally agree with you.
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:55.959]  You're dead on.
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:57.420]  You said it almost four years ago.
[02:41:57.559 --> 02:41:58.100]  It's all happened.
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:01.979]  You're incredible at predicting things, but I don't want to be a little over too confident here.
[02:42:02.079 --> 02:42:03.340]  That's when I get a chill up my spine.
[02:42:03.479 --> 02:42:04.540]  So what are you worried about?
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:08.659]  One by one, they're going to capitulate because they're greedy.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.979]  I mean, Bitcoin turns greed into altruism.
[02:42:12.139 --> 02:42:14.219]  That's the alchemical mystery of it all.
[02:42:14.559 --> 02:42:20.860]  People who are greedy and they think malevolently and they're evil and they're going to be monopolists.
[02:42:21.059 --> 02:42:21.899]  Well, guess what?
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:28.280]  Whatever monopoly you have in mind, you should just give it up and buy Bitcoin because you'll be fabulously more wealthy than you could ever imagine.
[02:42:28.459 --> 02:42:30.159]  And that's the secret sauce of Bitcoin.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:35.540]  It turns evil people into good people because it Converts greed into altruism.
[02:42:35.979 --> 02:42:37.459]  One by one, they're falling.
[02:42:37.659 --> 02:42:39.559]  So we saw it in the political sphere.
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:44.200]  Two or three years ago, nobody in Congress was really talking about Bitcoin.
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:46.559]  Ted Cruz, Cynthia Lummis, Donald Trump.
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:49.719]  So once you start to think about Bitcoin, it changes you.
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:52.700]  I always say, you don't change Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you.
[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:54.139]  And let me interrupt you again, this is so important.
[02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:56.639]  I don't have a big enough crew because they've sued me for years.
[02:42:56.719 --> 02:42:57.899]  We lost half the crew of the cruise grade.
[02:42:58.299 --> 02:43:00.540]  I'm asking people on X that are watching this live.
[02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:08.159]  We're going to archive it in an hour or so to X. I'm asking listeners, go back and find the interview starting about three and a half years ago.
[02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:09.899]  Of course, you've been on for 16, 17, but...
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:11.520]  Longer than that now.
[02:43:11.639 --> 02:43:11.760]  Wow.
[02:43:12.479 --> 02:43:20.120]  Find the interviews from three and a half, three years ago and three years ago with Max Keiser saying they're all going to capitulate to Bitcoin.
[02:43:20.239 --> 02:43:21.500]  The globalists are going to get thrown out.
[02:43:21.799 --> 02:43:24.500]  Trump's going to get back in because people love predictions that come true.
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:25.979]  Plus, it shows how much credibility is here.
[02:43:26.239 --> 02:43:39.159]  I'm asking listeners, take this interview and edit it together with the older shows with Max because people need to understand what he's saying is true so that when they also watch this interview, they see what you say is coming next.
[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:39.680]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:40.590 --> 02:43:44.430]  Look, Bitcoin fulfills an essential human need.
[02:43:44.629 --> 02:43:51.350]  And that is the need for perfect money that allows you to travel through time and space, as I've just described it.
[02:43:51.569 --> 02:43:52.530]  Humans are curious.
[02:43:52.530 --> 02:43:53.389]  We like to travel.
[02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:54.469]  We like to meet new people.
[02:43:54.569 --> 02:43:55.709]  We like to discover things.
[02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:58.190]  And money is the means by which we can do that.
[02:43:58.309 --> 02:44:04.979]  Going all the way back from pretty shells on the beach To stones that are considered valuable to arrowheads.
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:08.180]  This gives us mobility through our time and space.
[02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:10.500]  We're not confined to our location.
[02:44:10.639 --> 02:44:11.399]  Humans are curious.
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:12.739]  We go to the stars, right?
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:13.760]  We're going to Mars.
[02:44:13.959 --> 02:44:16.500]  Elon Musk is the ultimate curious human being.
[02:44:16.739 --> 02:44:24.020]  That's all possible because of a concept called money that, by the way, The idea of money invented the concept of time itself.
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:36.280]  Because if you are saving something in your pocket because you think it's aesthetically beautiful and you know that a year from now somebody's going to want that in exchange for, let's say, a meal or a narrowhead, you've just invented time, right?
[02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:44.459]  You've just went from hunter-gatherer minute by minute to feed yourself for that minute to thinking about a year.
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:45.879]  Five years.
[02:44:45.959 --> 02:44:48.780]  You just invented the seeds of civilization.
[02:44:48.879 --> 02:44:59.340]  And you're saying just as glass and beads and arrowheads built civilization, built time, built saving, built art, we're about to see the greatest renaissance ever.
[02:44:59.989 --> 02:45:00.250]  Right.
[02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:08.129]  And the Bitcoin 10-minute interval where the audit is conducted and new Bitcoin is released is quantum computer resistant for this very reason.
[02:45:08.190 --> 02:45:09.430]  It's already baked into the cake.
[02:45:09.450 --> 02:45:11.370]  It was already figured out long ago.
[02:45:11.489 --> 02:45:24.030]  And therefore, there's no problem with any advance in computer computational power because it simply accommodates this per the protocol every two weeks at the difficulty adjustment.
[02:45:24.229 --> 02:45:26.149]  So It's already baked into the cake.
[02:45:26.250 --> 02:45:30.510]  What's great is that this means that we're getting rid of centralization.
[02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:34.670]  So I say that money existed before the state.
[02:45:34.930 --> 02:45:41.090]  Bitcoin separates money from state, and Bitcoin kills the state.
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.100]  Separation of money and state is similar to separation of the state and church.
[02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:55.059]  And that was a major evolution in the Enlightenment and the Renaissance was to allow the individual to express themselves freely.
[02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:57.739]  And they gave us Da Vinci and Michelangelo and the Renaissance.
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.940]  Now we're separating money from the state.
[02:46:01.159 --> 02:46:08.100]  So no, the state can no longer use money to corrupt and to print money to finance all these horrible programs.
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:17.559]  And instead, Bitcoin is not central bank digital currency that is the state not just trying to maintain control over money, but expand it to micromanages.
[02:46:17.799 --> 02:46:21.079]  The good news is all those programs are falling apart because people aren't adopting them.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:21.940]  Right.
[02:46:22.079 --> 02:46:26.899]  You know, Elon Musk is going to get rid of all the programs like President Malay in Argentina.
[02:46:26.899 --> 02:46:30.540]  He's just getting rid of all these extraneous programs that are fed by money printing.
[02:46:30.659 --> 02:46:31.700]  Money printing is an evil.
[02:46:31.799 --> 02:46:37.780]  Money printing just feeds the worst in the society who are good at getting the government to print money for them.
[02:46:37.899 --> 02:46:39.020]  They're not good at anything else.
[02:46:39.430 --> 02:46:45.489]  But here, that's called a proof-of-stake model, where you just try to aggregate more paper money so that you can influence politicians.
[02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:45.950]  No, I agree.
[02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:47.010]  So, Max, you're on fire.
[02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:50.809]  The time we've got left, you've got to come back for a full hour next week if you can.
[02:46:51.049 --> 02:46:52.870]  Maybe you can host an hour, whatever you want to do next week.
[02:46:53.270 --> 02:46:55.270]  But here's what I'm asking you then.
[02:46:55.469 --> 02:46:57.170]  You've told us the future before.
[02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:58.530]  Now we want it again.
[02:46:59.309 --> 02:47:03.670]  Go back to the show three and a half years ago, or several shows you did that we've got to dig up, because I'm remembering them.
[02:47:03.729 --> 02:47:04.170]  It was incredible.
[02:47:04.610 --> 02:47:05.870]  Take us into the future again.
[02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:08.489]  Tell us what's coming next to the establishment and then to us.
[02:47:08.979 --> 02:47:10.379]  Well, it's hyper-Bitcoinization.
[02:47:10.459 --> 02:47:12.840]  And we see here in El Salvador developing right now.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.920]  So you are paid in Bitcoin, you save in Bitcoin, you use Bitcoin in commerce.
[02:47:17.079 --> 02:47:20.260]  It's a circular economy like we have in Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador.
[02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:21.440]  Everything is Bitcoin.
[02:47:21.559 --> 02:47:22.340]  Bitcoin takes over.
[02:47:22.479 --> 02:47:32.700]  But it'll be done, you know, the displacement of the fiat money world and the replacement of it by Bitcoin means Bitcoin price has to go to half a million, million, two million, five million dollars per Bitcoin.
[02:47:33.129 --> 02:47:39.829]  So if you want to be a participant in the future, try to stack as much Bitcoin as you possibly can right now.
[02:47:39.989 --> 02:47:44.409]  So when the inflation hits, and inflation is really biting people out.
[02:47:44.610 --> 02:47:46.930]  You know, cocoa and beef are hitting new all-time highs.
[02:47:47.129 --> 02:47:48.930]  This is the result of all the money printing.
[02:47:49.049 --> 02:47:50.149]  They can't hide it anymore.
[02:47:50.370 --> 02:47:52.049]  They can't pretend it's not there anymore.
[02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:54.309]  It's now turning into hyperinflation.
[02:47:54.569 --> 02:47:57.110]  And people are really suffering because of this inflation.
[02:47:57.329 --> 02:48:04.329]  And the only way you can perfectly defend yourself against hyperinflation is by hyper-Bitcoinization, is by buying as much Bitcoin as you possibly can.
[02:48:04.690 --> 02:48:07.790]  And watch everything in Bitcoin terms go down in price.
[02:48:07.950 --> 02:48:14.290]  All of your Christmas shopping this year, if you own Bitcoin, is 50% cheaper because Bitcoin, since last year, is up 100%.
[02:48:14.290 --> 02:48:15.950]  And that'll be the same next year.
[02:48:16.090 --> 02:48:20.170]  Your Christmas shopping will be half again cheap next year, too, because Bitcoin will keep going up.
[02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:24.110]  Your purchasing power is mathematically guaranteed to go up.
[02:48:24.239 --> 02:48:26.079]  What's going to happen to the globalists?
[02:48:26.079 --> 02:48:27.520]  You say a lot of them are already capitulating.
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:27.920]  They are.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:28.579]  We predicted that.
[02:48:28.579 --> 02:48:29.260]  It's now happening.
[02:48:29.579 --> 02:48:30.680]  The list is too long to go over.
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:34.819]  But I'm really concerned about the bad economy affecting Trump.
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:39.799]  What are Trump's weak spots so we can get him to see that?
[02:48:40.659 --> 02:48:44.459]  Trump's major weak spot is that he is not Bitcoin only.
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:52.700]  He is talking about other projects, what we call the altcoins, or there's another name for it, shitcoins.
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:55.899]  And these projects are very seductive.
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:57.979]  They are the same as fiat money, though.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:04.540]  You print them up by venture capitalists in California, and they are basically digital fiat money.
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:07.379]  And those people have his ear.
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:08.379]  He needs to...
[02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:20.100]  Shut them out of the conversation and focus exclusively on the only decentralized money that separates a state from money that is secure.
[02:49:20.319 --> 02:49:21.379]  Nothing else is secure.
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:24.340]  I'm not an expert like you, but it's really simple.
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:28.180]  All the other stuff are just pump and dumps and really are shit.
[02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:30.590]  Yeah, totally.
[02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:32.250]  I mean, that's essentially what it is.
[02:49:33.170 --> 02:49:35.850]  But they're very seductive because they print their own money.
[02:49:35.930 --> 02:49:40.709]  They can afford, let's say, to go to Mar-a-Lago and buy a yacht and throw a party.
[02:49:40.930 --> 02:49:42.629]  And it looks great, sounds great.
[02:49:42.809 --> 02:49:45.969]  But of course, it's the devil's poison, essentially.
[02:49:46.170 --> 02:49:48.030]  I mean, it's a terrible route to go.
[02:49:48.239 --> 02:50:03.360]  So I would say, if you stick on Bitcoin only, I would say to my fellow Bitcoin compadres, you know, there's a lot of high-profile Bitcoiners that are slipping and sliding when they meet with the president and allowing him to kind of veer off course a little bit, thinking that, well,
[02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:09.959]  Bitcoin's a Trojan horse, and we'll just let it do its thing, and we'll let him kind of make his mistakes that everyone has made.
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:12.340]  But in my feeling, that's a slippery slope.
[02:50:12.459 --> 02:50:13.760]  You've got to be firm.
[02:50:13.979 --> 02:50:17.500]  You know, anything that's not Bitcoin is essentially you're becoming...
[02:50:20.709 --> 02:50:21.750]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:50:21.829 --> 02:50:22.290]  Let's be clear.
[02:50:22.409 --> 02:50:30.149]  You and I, and folks, a lot of talk shows have no problem raising money because they're always promoting the next coin, and then you're making money in a pump and dump.
[02:50:30.290 --> 02:50:35.569]  You're making money on the upside, getting people to buy it, and then you make money, but it hurts people down the road.
[02:50:35.729 --> 02:50:37.569]  I will have nothing to do with that.
[02:50:37.930 --> 02:50:41.360]  That's why I've never had anything to do with it because I won't That's evil.
[02:50:41.559 --> 02:50:43.360]  I will not be involved consciously in evil.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:45.520]  I sure do it on accident all the time, and I repent of it.
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:46.620]  But it's very simple.
[02:50:46.739 --> 02:50:50.379]  I want to promote things that are the best, that are tried and true.
[02:50:50.639 --> 02:50:57.200]  And you know with me, it took me, you know, you're trying to turn me on to Bitcoin 13, 14 years ago.
[02:50:57.399 --> 02:50:59.940]  It took me until about, what, five years ago to finally get it.
[02:51:00.780 --> 02:51:02.379]  Because it's been successful.
[02:51:02.379 --> 02:51:03.180]  You can't deny it.
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:06.520]  Yeah, I mean, it's that Hawk Tui girl.
[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:08.379]  She did a coin a couple of weeks ago.
[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:12.420]  It ran up tremendously, and all the insiders cashed out.
[02:51:12.559 --> 02:51:13.280]  It was a pump and dump.
[02:51:13.459 --> 02:51:18.280]  And now she's going to have to go to court and defend herself against selling an unregistered security, and she could go to jail.
[02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:19.020]  Right?
[02:51:19.139 --> 02:51:20.159]  So here's this poor girl.
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.360]  They found her in a mall somewhere.
[02:51:21.399 --> 02:51:22.819]  She made some vulgar comment.
[02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:26.079]  Now they attach her to a meme coin, and now she might go to jail.
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:29.479]  That's the whole history of every single one of these projects that's not Bitcoin.
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:31.920]  It's all run by charlatans and scammers.
[02:51:32.219 --> 02:51:39.000]  And that's my fear of Trump is that he allows some of these guys under the tent and they start to cause mischief.
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:40.579]  And that would be a tragedy.
[02:51:42.019 --> 02:51:42.379]  100%.
[02:51:42.379 --> 02:51:47.959]  Max, talk to the producers if you want to pop in for a full hour next week, Monday or Tuesday.
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:54.200]  Hell, I'd love you just to host an hour Monday or Tuesday, maybe in the third hour, maybe Monday, Tuesday.
[02:51:54.379 --> 02:51:55.219]  You let me know.
[02:51:55.479 --> 02:51:57.180]  People should follow you at MaxKaiserOnX.
[02:51:57.239 --> 02:51:57.879]  God bless you, Max.
[02:51:58.549 --> 02:51:59.389]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:59.590 --> 02:52:00.110]  Merry Christmas.
[02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:17.069]  We're good to go.
[02:52:17.469 --> 02:52:34.329]  We're good to go.
[02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:45.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:46.889]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:52:47.049 --> 02:52:48.790]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:52:48.850 --> 02:52:51.829]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:53.610]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:52:54.430 --> 02:52:56.069]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:58.549]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:52:58.690 --> 02:53:04.409]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:09.829]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:53:10.420 --> 02:53:18.559]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:53:18.620 --> 02:53:21.920]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:30.120]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:53:30.379 --> 02:53:33.559]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.

[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:36.040]  Go check it out.
[02:53:36.299 --> 02:53:38.159]  That's there discounted up to $50.
[02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:42.959]  55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:53:43.139 --> 02:53:43.680]  Try it.
[02:53:43.719 --> 02:53:44.360]  You're going to love it.
[02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:44.860]  I'm on it.
[02:53:44.879 --> 02:53:45.739]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:46.700]  It's insane.
[02:53:46.840 --> 02:53:47.840]  Get that and other supplements.
[02:53:48.020 --> 02:53:52.500]  And then there's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:53:52.739 --> 02:53:59.020]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top Top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:53:59.139 --> 02:53:59.959]  They have the best designs.
[02:54:00.379 --> 02:54:02.100]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:04.579]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:54:04.959 --> 02:54:06.239]  These designs are incredible.
[02:54:06.420 --> 02:54:12.639]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep you on the air one way or another.
[02:54:12.780 --> 02:54:13.399]  Here they are.
[02:54:13.569 --> 02:54:14.350]  Look at this one.
[02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:18.430]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:54:18.649 --> 02:54:20.450]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:54:20.590 --> 02:54:21.610]  You've got to get that.
[02:54:22.229 --> 02:54:23.950]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:54:24.190 --> 02:54:24.870]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:25.290 --> 02:54:28.489]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:31.889]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:54:32.350 --> 02:54:33.510]  Team Humanity.
[02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:35.190]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:54:35.309 --> 02:54:37.530]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:54:37.690 --> 02:54:39.469]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:54:39.899 --> 02:54:45.079]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:46.420]  Darkest Hour.
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:47.899]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:54:48.159 --> 02:54:53.020]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:54:53.079 --> 02:54:55.159]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:54:55.719 --> 02:55:00.520]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:13.139]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:16.959]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:20.860]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.280]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:55:23.459 --> 02:55:24.700]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:55:24.799 --> 02:55:26.059]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:29.239]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:55:29.379 --> 02:55:30.979]  And they spread the word, you meet like-minded people.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:37.379]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:55:37.459 --> 02:55:40.639]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:51.639]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:54.239]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:55:54.340 --> 02:56:04.540]  If you really wanna support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.500]  But regardless, you're gonna love the supplements.
[02:56:06.739 --> 02:56:07.959]  You're gonna wanna order again.
[02:56:08.219 --> 02:56:10.340]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:56:10.719 --> 02:56:11.840]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:56:11.979 --> 02:56:12.799]  We're going after them.
[02:56:12.899 --> 02:56:18.920]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:56:19.239 --> 02:56:20.379]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:24.139]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:33.739]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:37.719]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:48.690]  All right, in this short segment, I'm going to finish up with what I covered in the first hour that I didn't get to the key point about what Trump should do to the State Department.
[02:56:49.409 --> 02:56:54.770]  And as National Security Advisor Biden is saying that, oh, Iran might sneak attack Israel or us with a nuke.
[02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:59.270]  And that if Trump doesn't start making deals with them, it's gonna be his fault.
[02:56:59.629 --> 02:57:01.549]  They're setting us up for a nuclear false flag.
[02:57:01.969 --> 02:57:03.530]  It's not like I just started saying this.
[02:57:03.610 --> 02:57:06.170]  I said, when they start saying this, we've got a big problem.
[02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:10.670]  Here's a clip in the last few months where I've been warning about this and now it's here.
[02:57:16.530 --> 02:57:19.569]  It's in the cards to use a small nuclear weapon and blame the Iranians.
[02:57:20.569 --> 02:57:21.610]  They'll be the fall guys.
[02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:24.129]  And then instantly we're in full war.
[02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:37.930]  And they're going to use the war to try to get Americans to, oh my God, we got hit by a nuke, Iran, Iran, with Russia.
[02:57:38.450 --> 02:57:40.969]  And then everybody's off the air except the corporate news.
[02:57:41.530 --> 02:57:49.069]  And then you're going to see all hell break loose because there are people inside all those corporate news organizations and inside the government that are our people.
[02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:55.389]  And we're not communicating like you guys are with your plans and your operations, your departmentalization.
[02:57:55.610 --> 02:57:57.350]  We all are just here like Fight Club.
[02:57:57.909 --> 02:58:00.709]  We are 112 days out from the election.
[02:58:01.389 --> 02:58:03.709]  Then there's the 79 days when he's president-elect.
[02:58:05.649 --> 02:58:08.309]  This is an eternity, 180-something days.
[02:58:09.030 --> 02:58:11.489]  Trump and Vance get killed.
[02:58:12.809 --> 02:58:14.649]  They don't care how obvious this is.
[02:58:16.569 --> 02:58:18.129]  They shouldn't be in the same city together.
[02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:20.790]  They'll set a nuke off and say Iran did it.
[02:58:22.610 --> 02:58:24.430]  They should definitely not get on the same airplane.
[02:58:24.829 --> 02:58:28.010]  They'll shoot that thing down so fast and say Iran did it, it'll make your head spin.
[02:58:28.409 --> 02:58:42.030]  I said on July 15th, two days after, I said, you know, they're going to blame Iran for trying to kill Trump on the 13th, and they're going to do it in the future, because then they can blame Iran and launch World War III with them.
[02:58:43.319 --> 02:58:47.500]  And use that as the political cover after they killed Trump to try to unify the populace around the government.
[02:58:48.899 --> 02:58:54.139]  And then two days after I said that, they officially came out and pushed it, and now they're pushing it super hard.
[02:58:54.340 --> 02:59:00.639]  Another Iranian plot this weekend to kill Trump, foiled by the FBI. And then it turns out the CIA was behind that as usual.
[02:59:00.719 --> 02:59:03.059]  They're bringing these guys in from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:07.700]  They think they work for ISIS or the Taliban, and it turns out the CIA is running.
[02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:09.559]  Will they stage a nuclear false flag?
[02:59:09.899 --> 02:59:12.840]  Will they nuke Trump in America and say the Iranians did it?
[02:59:13.709 --> 02:59:24.209]  I mean, I was the first to say, two days after they tried to kill Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13th, I said, now they're gonna start saying the Iranians are behind it and behind future attacks in service to air missiles.
[02:59:24.909 --> 02:59:30.510]  Two days later, exactly that, the FBI. It's not hard to know their moves when you're not naive.
[02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:33.549]  They would rather burn the world down than lose power.
[02:59:33.770 --> 02:59:39.010]  They got a choice, go to prison or start World War III, nuclear war.
[02:59:40.979 --> 02:59:49.819]  Okay, so now the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, said they've briefed Trump and the Iranians might try to nuke Israel or us.
[02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:52.040]  And then Iran's like, we're not doing that.
[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:53.159]  We're not trying to kill you, Trump.
[02:59:53.959 --> 02:59:58.620]  And one of the big places Trump screwed up in the last few months is to say, well, if I do get killed, blow up Iran.
[02:59:59.620 --> 03:00:02.159]  You're begging them, Mr. President, to kill you.
[03:00:04.319 --> 03:00:05.780]  I love Trump to death, folks.
[03:00:06.020 --> 03:00:07.399]  People go, oh, it's all 3D chess.
[03:00:07.540 --> 03:00:08.139]  He's very smart.
[03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:11.510]  But he's got blind spots.
[03:00:12.209 --> 03:00:15.790]  He's admitted he didn't understand when he first got in eight years ago and they lied to him.
[03:00:16.049 --> 03:00:18.690]  And the Republicans put operatives in that work with the Democrats.
[03:00:18.690 --> 03:00:20.329]  He didn't understand that, how bad it was.
[03:00:20.889 --> 03:00:24.409]  And I told you back then, Trump is not omnipresent like some of you think.
[03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:26.930]  All that Q stuff, oh, he's invincible.
[03:00:27.149 --> 03:00:28.110]  He's setting them up.
[03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.809]  It's a no, no, no.
[03:00:29.489 --> 03:00:33.469]  Humanity woke up and stopped being naive and supported and got in the streets and voted.
[03:00:33.829 --> 03:00:34.829]  That's how we beat them.
[03:00:35.149 --> 03:00:36.569]  So Trump needs to come out.
[03:00:37.729 --> 03:00:40.270]  And say, we don't want nuclear war with Iran.
[03:00:40.690 --> 03:00:43.270]  He needs to learn that Iran doesn't want nuclear war.
[03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:45.889]  He needs to understand he can be set up with a nuclear false flag.
[03:00:46.049 --> 03:00:48.149]  Iran needs to come out and reiterate that again.
[03:00:49.350 --> 03:00:51.950]  Because this could be how they really try to derail things.
[03:00:52.489 --> 03:00:53.250]  We'll be right back.
[03:00:53.370 --> 03:00:53.850]  Stay with us.
[03:00:54.209 --> 03:00:58.629]  Well, Harlem and New York in general is not too happy right now with the illegal alien invasion.
[03:00:59.129 --> 03:01:00.610]  At least 500,000 of them.
[03:01:00.729 --> 03:01:05.370]  A lot of hardened core criminals dumped out of Guatemala, Venezuela, you name it, told to come to America.
[03:01:07.090 --> 03:01:13.670]  Flown in by the Democrats, and then they're allowed to basically do whatever the hell they want.
[03:01:15.489 --> 03:01:31.190]  Now, the good news is, Tom Homan's the new head of the border operations, Trump's border czar, and he has said, and Trump has said, we're not just going to find the missing kids and others, not just prosecute the low-level human traffickers,
[03:01:31.209 --> 03:01:34.750]  we're going to prosecute the NGOs and government officials.
[03:01:37.810 --> 03:01:53.350]  And I have advised Homan and Trump, and I know General Flynn has as well, and they didn't need me to tell them this, but I have, that the Democrats are planning for ICE to make a mistake, which is easy to do when you don't want millions of people you're getting.
[03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:55.889]  And they're going to try to create civil unrest.
[03:01:55.889 --> 03:01:57.030]  They're going to try to have uprisings.
[03:01:57.129 --> 03:01:58.950]  The Democrat governors and mayors have said that.
[03:01:59.909 --> 03:02:05.049]  So I said, go after the smugglers, the drug dealers, the human traffickers first.
[03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:09.690]  That's the leadership at the grassroots bad guy level.
[03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:19.110]  Then go after the NGOs and the for-profits, the government agency, people that made the decisions, Mayorkas, Kamala Harris, and others, and then that's the right thing to do.
[03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:35.440]  Then find the children, liberate them, prosecute those people, and that'll take you a good six months to get the real hardcore criminal perpetrators, and everybody will get on board to then deport all the military-age men, But I said,
[03:02:35.559 --> 03:02:46.079]  when you find women that were 15 years old three years ago, they're now 17, 18, brought in, and kids, and the rest of it, Biden said immediately surge the border when I went.
[03:02:46.379 --> 03:02:48.739]  And NGOs, front of the State Department, brought them up here.
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:50.340]  So they're victims.
[03:02:51.639 --> 03:03:01.440]  So they need to be given money and help to go back, or they need to be looked at for asylum because they were abused by the U.S. government.
[03:03:02.250 --> 03:03:06.250]  And so they need to have cases, a lot of them, where they can stay here.
[03:03:06.649 --> 03:03:08.790]  That's the moral thing to do.
[03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:14.409]  And, funny how the moral thing to do works, it takes anything the bad guys can twist away.
[03:03:14.549 --> 03:03:17.010]  Now, Holman's been on TV recently saying exactly that.
[03:03:18.270 --> 03:03:20.690]  Very smart, and the right thing to do, and he's been attacked.
[03:03:22.030 --> 03:03:24.129]  By some of the, you know, ultra-right-wing people.
[03:03:24.370 --> 03:03:25.870]  And I say that using a media term.
[03:03:25.989 --> 03:03:26.610]  They're not ultra-right-wing.
[03:03:26.930 --> 03:03:28.569]  They're like, this isn't purist.
[03:03:28.809 --> 03:03:31.090]  You know, we want to see military rolling up and down the streets.
[03:03:31.149 --> 03:03:34.850]  We want to see the mass, you know, roundups.
[03:03:35.090 --> 03:03:46.270]  Well, yeah, you're going to see the feds and local police where they work with the feds constitutionally get the gangbangers, get the drug dealers, get the human traffickers.
[03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:47.290]  That's a big job.
[03:03:47.409 --> 03:03:48.370]  There's millions...
[03:03:49.409 --> 03:03:59.530]  A lot of the estimates I've seen are about 2 million hardcore criminals, and they're all criminal that came here knowingly, but they came here at the invite of the Democratic Party.
[03:04:00.350 --> 03:04:10.649]  So if somebody is a young woman that came across or was smuggled across or a 3-year-old child or a 6-month-old baby, well, they're victims.
[03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:15.870]  And so, the controlled corporate media is losing right now, big time.
[03:04:16.069 --> 03:04:19.709]  They're sitting back, hoping this is done ham-fistedly.
[03:04:21.129 --> 03:04:22.950]  And that's the Achilles heel.
[03:04:24.069 --> 03:04:30.989]  So, Homan has said, basically word for word, but I've said, not that he needed me to tell him, but I was making sure.
[03:04:32.090 --> 03:04:33.690]  And so, that's good.
[03:04:35.250 --> 03:04:36.190]  And good.
[03:04:36.909 --> 03:04:47.040]  Already the police know that there's a new sheriff in town, so they just busted the Bunch of this Venezuelan crime network in Denver that were kidnapping people, home invasions, all the rest of it.
[03:04:48.139 --> 03:04:54.479]  But now let's talk about, it's actually 19 detained for home invasion, you name it.
[03:04:54.819 --> 03:04:56.860]  Of course, vindicating everything Trump said.
[03:04:57.700 --> 03:05:04.540]  But we personally have countless interviews we've shot in airports around the country and at the Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona border.
[03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:07.200]  We've had the whistleblowers that testify to Congress here.
[03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:16.969]  That saw none of the human trafficking going on that worked for the feds as contractors and as Border Patrol and others during Trump.
[03:05:17.129 --> 03:05:18.549]  He just shut it down 98%.
[03:05:18.549 --> 03:05:23.770]  And then under Biden accelerated, it was really bad under Biden.
[03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:25.030]  Trump basically shut it down.
[03:05:25.250 --> 03:05:26.250]  You've seen the graphs.
[03:05:26.850 --> 03:05:31.549]  The graph Trump was shown when he got shot in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th.
[03:05:33.010 --> 03:05:35.950]  And then it quadrupled under Biden.
[03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:49.309]  And so Mayorkas is on record with the NGOs that were ordering the State Guard, the National Guard, because the State Guards would get a sign of the National Guard, and the Border Patrol of what to do.
[03:05:49.770 --> 03:06:03.270]  And the first thing Biden did when he got in four years ago, we didn't learn this until about a year ago, was kill, even though it was already congressionally funded, all the DNA testing of questionable children with people that obviously aren't their families.
[03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:10.840]  That, in all the studies, and I can put articles on that on screen in a moment, caused massive children to be able to be smuggled.
[03:06:11.219 --> 03:06:17.579]  You've got all these MS-13 type people caught working for the government and the NGOs, smuggling the babies.
[03:06:17.579 --> 03:06:18.760]  We've shot the footage ourselves.
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:21.520]  We were just showing where she comes, the same lady.
[03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:24.000]  That's just down in McAllen, Texas, every hour at the airport.
[03:06:24.579 --> 03:06:28.540]  And she signs paperwork saying, it's my baby, it's my baby, and then just hands a kid over.
[03:06:28.579 --> 03:06:29.479]  No one knows who they are.
[03:06:29.639 --> 03:06:45.350]  And then we've had the whistleblowers on that were on the planes, With babies as young as three months, and a plane full of other ages of kids, and they'd have no paperwork, and in some cases, no formula, no diapers, and they would go city to city to city, sometimes for up to 10 hours,
[03:06:45.809 --> 03:06:52.149]  literally with shit all over the plane, because the government didn't even care to provide diapers to babies they were smuggling.
[03:06:54.629 --> 03:07:04.579]  And so, Mayorkas has now come out in a national interview And said, oh, well, we knew they're smuggling.
[03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:07.079]  We even know where a lot of the kids are, but it's not our job.
[03:07:08.940 --> 03:07:20.760]  Really, DHS that has the law enforcement power over the border is not statutorily involved to stop drug dealing, human trafficking.
[03:07:21.059 --> 03:07:22.340]  I mean, that's on its face.
[03:07:22.479 --> 03:07:22.920]  It's a lie.
[03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:27.440]  Congress created those agencies under law to do exactly that.
[03:07:29.319 --> 03:07:29.879]  So...
[03:07:33.430 --> 03:07:46.770]  The truth is, is what high-level federal judges in the last few years have told me in meetings, and they pointed me to public documents where, and you've seen this in the news recently, cases of three, four, five times convicted of human trafficking and pedophilia.
[03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:51.149]  And they released them again and again and again and again.
[03:07:53.989 --> 03:08:10.409]  This is us four years ago, back when it wasn't in the mainstream media yet, in South Texas, Showing kids from a few months old up to 16 being loaded on the planes night and day and taking off to be dropped off at airfields and Walmart parking lots and just random addresses.
[03:08:11.250 --> 03:08:13.989]  And then the DHS has leaked many of the names.
[03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:16.270]  Munkraker report goes out to the houses.
[03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:19.909]  And they go, where's the little kid?
[03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.430]  We don't know.
[03:08:20.530 --> 03:08:21.350]  We gave it away to somebody.
[03:08:23.149 --> 03:08:29.590]  So Mayorkas goes on TV and says, we don't know, you know, exactly where they all are, but we know where some are, but it doesn't matter.
[03:08:29.690 --> 03:08:30.889]  It's not our job.
[03:08:33.209 --> 03:08:39.770]  Really, to tell them surge up here, to have the NGOs pay to get them up here, to let known traffickers use kids to get across the border over and over again.
[03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:42.610]  Remember what Obama did in his second administration?
[03:08:42.610 --> 03:08:48.489]  He said, we have a policy where anybody under 18 that gets here will be instantly given asylum.
[03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:52.389]  People started then using children to get across over and over again.
[03:08:52.690 --> 03:08:55.930]  Sometimes they would just throw them in a field or sell them to sex traffickers.
[03:08:57.090 --> 03:09:11.909]  So to have Mayorkas come out and openly say that it's outside their responsibility is crazy.
[03:09:12.010 --> 03:09:18.030]  All I got to type in is O'Biden ended DNA testing of children.
[03:09:18.930 --> 03:09:20.069]  Only takes a day to get it.
[03:09:20.170 --> 03:09:20.450]  It's cheap.
[03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:25.790]  Biden to end familial DNA testing at border.
[03:09:25.969 --> 03:09:27.309]  Key deterrent to fraud and child trafficking.
[03:09:27.549 --> 03:09:33.629]  Now that broke last year, but it turned out in congressional testimony three months ago, he did it as one of his first acts secretly.
[03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:38.870]  CBS News expert says ending DNA testing at the border will result in more suffering and exploitation.
[03:09:39.090 --> 03:09:39.229]  Really?
[03:09:39.290 --> 03:09:39.729]  You think so?
[03:09:39.969 --> 03:09:41.030]  That's called...
[03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:44.969]  They had the funds and said don't use it for that.
[03:09:50.100 --> 03:09:58.040]  And the Democrats openly have their NGOs get the kids, sign up for welfare, and the older ones they've caught in slave labor.
[03:09:58.440 --> 03:10:00.440]  Even the New York Times reported on that last year.
[03:10:01.639 --> 03:10:05.200]  So, Mayorkas is in a lot of trouble.
[03:10:05.819 --> 03:10:21.250]  But for him to sit up there and think the public is so stupid, and to say that statutorily the Department of Homeland Security Has no jurisdiction over human trafficking.
[03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:37.850]  Why do you think the Department of Transportation, and they've got DHS there, and Customs and Border Patrol that's under DHS, when you fly in from Mexico, when you go to Cancun for a couple days, and it's you and your wife and your kids,
[03:10:37.930 --> 03:10:41.569]  and they look at the passports, and sometimes it's even happened to me, they go, is this your daddy?
[03:10:41.989 --> 03:10:43.969]  And I don't mind that, because it's a border.
[03:10:44.129 --> 03:10:45.149]  They have jurisdiction there.
[03:10:45.709 --> 03:10:46.930]  She goes, yeah, it's my daddy.
[03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:49.190]  Alright, sweetie, have fun.
[03:10:51.809 --> 03:10:57.809]  That's not cops pulling me over randomly and asking me a question without probable cause or due process.
[03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:58.649]  I get pissed at that.
[03:10:58.729 --> 03:10:59.370]  That's never happened.
[03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:03.870]  But I'm crossing an international border into my country.
[03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:06.129]  I want them to check the passport.
[03:11:06.350 --> 03:11:08.770]  I want them to ask my kids, is this your dad?
[03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:09.370]  Is this your mom?
[03:11:09.549 --> 03:11:10.090]  They better.
[03:11:11.229 --> 03:11:14.190]  I mean, quite frankly, I'm surprised it's only happened once or twice.
[03:11:15.350 --> 03:11:16.649]  So, honey, where are you going?
[03:11:16.750 --> 03:11:17.389]  What's your name?
[03:11:18.409 --> 03:11:19.629]  Is this your daddy or your mommy?
[03:11:20.590 --> 03:11:21.569]  Daughter's holding onto your leg.
[03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.930]  Yeah.
[03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:23.549]  Okay, have a nice...
[03:11:23.549 --> 03:11:24.209]  Welcome back.
[03:11:25.809 --> 03:11:37.409]  So, there is more screening of a U.S. citizen with their children, or just a U.S. citizen by themselves, than there is of people just wandering up with children.
[03:11:37.409 --> 03:11:39.670]  In many cases, guys, type into a search engine.
[03:11:39.809 --> 03:11:41.090]  Go to X, they block it or else.
[03:11:41.930 --> 03:11:42.770]  Drugged children...
[03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:45.420]  Coming across border.
[03:11:45.659 --> 03:11:49.680]  And you'll see like six, seven kids, four months, six months, a year, two years, and they're just like...
[03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:51.040]  And people walk up.
[03:11:51.139 --> 03:11:52.379]  It's obviously smugglers.
[03:11:52.760 --> 03:11:53.799]  It's not their kids.
[03:11:54.459 --> 03:11:56.139]  And I've interviewed a lot of the whistleblowers.
[03:11:56.299 --> 03:11:57.159]  They've told the Congress this.
[03:11:58.620 --> 03:11:59.979]  Six, seven, eight, nine-year-olds...
[03:12:00.969 --> 03:12:12.790]  They go to get them at the facility to fly them to Lord knows where, and the kids are crying, speaking Spanish or speaking native dialects from Guatemala and other areas, and they'll have to get a special translator, and they're saying, I am from the village of this place.
[03:12:12.930 --> 03:12:14.690]  I have been gone several months.
[03:12:14.790 --> 03:12:16.610]  I want to be taken back to my mommy.
[03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:35.850]  And Mayorkas has told people in Congress, we played the clips, and so have his adjuncts, that when the children beg to be sent back and say, this is not my daddy, or aren't even a company, They are told no.
[03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:39.750]  So children are saying, I got kidnapped in Mexico.
[03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:40.930]  I got kidnapped in Venezuela.
[03:12:40.930 --> 03:12:42.069]  I got kidnapped in Guatemala.
[03:12:43.209 --> 03:12:44.489]  Please send me home.
[03:12:44.629 --> 03:12:45.389]  This is where I'm from.
[03:12:45.989 --> 03:12:51.030]  In some of the congressional testimony, the kids are 10 years old and know their mama's cell phone.
[03:12:52.530 --> 03:12:54.350]  And the board patrol will say, let's call it.
[03:12:54.409 --> 03:12:55.010]  They're told no.
[03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:58.110]  We don't send them back.
[03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:59.069]  You can look that up.
[03:12:59.450 --> 03:13:01.750]  And then Mayorkas has got the nerve.
[03:13:05.209 --> 03:13:07.809]  To say it's not his jurisdiction.
[03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:08.989]  I'm gonna explain something in law.
[03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:10.190]  It is their jurisdiction.
[03:13:11.709 --> 03:13:27.559]  But separately, again, if I know my neighbor is cooking methamphetamine in their shack over my fence, And the neighbor tries to enlist you in it and tells you he's doing it.
[03:13:27.659 --> 03:13:29.799]  And you know he's doing it and you don't call the police.
[03:13:29.799 --> 03:13:35.600]  You're aiding and abetting the production of a serious narcotic.
[03:13:37.319 --> 03:13:38.719]  Five, ten years in prison.
[03:13:40.399 --> 03:13:48.840]  So private citizens have a responsibility when they know serious crimes are being committed to report them.
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:14:01.040]  Instead, the left wants you to be like Germany, where you report that your neighbor said a cuss word, said a slang, or criticized a politician, or prayed quietly out in front of church, like England, all the hundreds of arrests we know of there.
[03:14:01.540 --> 03:14:03.799]  It's thousands, actually, for that, but hundreds of videos.
[03:14:04.899 --> 03:14:07.799]  So, tattle on your neighbor for their speech.
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:09.520]  Get somebody fired because they're not politically correct.
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:15.799]  That's okay, but don't fire somebody because they take an experimental poison shot in violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[03:14:20.899 --> 03:14:27.139]  But the head of the Department of Homeland Security says they don't have any responsibility while they're actually aiding it.
[03:14:27.979 --> 03:14:34.120]  Mayorkas is an arrogant SOB who thought they were going to be able to steal the election and thought he could get away with anything he wanted.
[03:14:34.299 --> 03:14:36.399]  And you look at his body language, he ain't so arrogant now.
[03:14:36.579 --> 03:14:38.299]  He looks like a deflated balloon.
[03:14:39.559 --> 03:14:41.979]  He looks like an old blown-up tire on the side of the highway.
[03:14:44.379 --> 03:14:49.040]  And I'll tell you, I've not been very critical of Trump, and I'm very happy so far what I've seen.
[03:14:50.389 --> 03:15:04.069]  But if there aren't criminal investigations and if there aren't indictments of the smugglers, which is already happening, and the NGOs, and then the big dogs, I'm going to get very upset.
[03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:08.430]  Because I will be then aiding and abetting if I got Trump in and then he's aiding and abetting.
[03:15:08.670 --> 03:15:09.870]  But Trump's not going to do that.
[03:15:10.989 --> 03:15:11.909]  It's the right thing to do.
[03:15:11.969 --> 03:15:14.270]  Plus, it will put the globalists on the run.
[03:15:14.649 --> 03:15:16.129]  It will put them on their heels.
[03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:18.389]  Not on their toes.
[03:15:18.709 --> 03:15:20.069]  We have to go on offense.
[03:15:20.069 --> 03:15:21.049]  And it's going to happen.
[03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.430]  Watch.
[03:15:25.250 --> 03:15:31.290]  So, Alejandro Mayorkas needs to be in a super max prison.
[03:15:34.409 --> 03:15:38.850]  But his statement here is trying to confuse people because he knows this is coming out.
[03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:40.950]  Oh, we know where the kids are, a lot of them.
[03:15:41.069 --> 03:15:42.190]  Actually, we just got our jurisdiction.
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:16:05.739]  And of course, we can have legal experts in congressional hearings explaining how it is and then say, well, why didn't you call the FBI? Oh, well, like the federal judges explained to me, the attorney general under laws passed decades ago has to green light federal judges and magistrates to go ahead with prosecutions,
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:07.100]  even if they have a grand jury indictment.
[03:16:07.809 --> 03:16:13.969]  Of illegal aliens when they commit serious crimes, and they will not greenlight almost any of them as you see them keep releasing them.
[03:16:14.670 --> 03:16:20.329]  Rapists, murderers, armed robbers, arsonists, over and over and over, human traffickers, pedophiles.
[03:16:22.250 --> 03:16:24.729]  I mean, I saw a bunch the last few days in New York alone.
[03:16:25.450 --> 03:16:31.770]  Rapists, five-time convicted child molester, kidnapper, released again, rapes a woman.
[03:16:33.350 --> 03:16:34.270]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[03:16:34.270 --> 03:16:35.229]  It's the same NGOs.
[03:16:35.430 --> 03:16:36.270]  It's the same policies.
[03:16:36.729 --> 03:16:39.209]  They got the DAs and the towns won't do anything in the cities.
[03:16:39.350 --> 03:16:40.729]  They got the feds won't do anything.
[03:16:40.909 --> 03:16:43.549]  You got the attorney general blocking it all.
[03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:50.610]  I mean, these are the most villainous scum on earth because they're involved in the pedophile networks.
[03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:58.920]  Just like came out in Congress 20 years ago with DynCorp and the UN. And they thought they had a free reign.
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:02.159]  If Trump goes after them, it's open and shut.
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:04.299]  We have their ass.
[03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:08.959]  Release the full Epstein list.
[03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:09.639]  Trump's doing it.
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:11.319]  Prosecute these people.
[03:17:11.559 --> 03:17:11.979]  Do it.
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:12.680]  Do it.
[03:17:12.819 --> 03:17:13.399]  Do it.
[03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:14.000]  Do it.
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:14.120]  Do it.
[03:17:14.479 --> 03:17:19.040]  Do it.
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:21.200]  They tried to kill you twice.
[03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:22.219]  We know I'm Trump!
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:29.959]  They're trying to start World War III! Our basic survival is at stake here.
[03:17:30.100 --> 03:17:31.239]  This is existential.
[03:17:35.219 --> 03:17:37.780]  And he's doing it.
[03:17:39.180 --> 03:17:42.459]  A lot of people said, well, don't let him know you're going to do it until you get in.
[03:17:42.780 --> 03:17:44.139]  No, it's making him capitulate.
[03:17:44.299 --> 03:17:44.860]  It's making him run.
[03:17:44.959 --> 03:17:46.379]  Oh my God, I've got huge news.
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:47.100]  Oh my Lord.
[03:17:48.319 --> 03:17:49.659]  Oh my God, I just remember.
[03:17:49.860 --> 03:17:50.440]  Oh my God.
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:51.739]  See, I just get such intel.
[03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:53.680]  This is from God.
[03:17:55.860 --> 03:18:01.780]  I got a call Wednesday while I was hiking up a mountain, and I hadn't been on my phone while I was in the backpack, but I get...
[03:18:01.780 --> 03:18:04.079]  And so I called the person back.
[03:18:04.200 --> 03:18:04.739]  They said, call me.
[03:18:04.799 --> 03:18:14.420]  And they said, it's confirmed that a bunch of the Hollywood people are actually leaving the country because of the investigations of P. Diddy, Epstein, the pedophile rings.
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:24.299]  And LeBron James just left last week and sold his condo in Florida to move to Europe, and it's connected to P. Diddy.
[03:18:27.789 --> 03:18:29.510]  Today, I'd forgotten about that.
[03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:30.469]  That's how much intel I get.
[03:18:30.549 --> 03:18:31.590]  This is a very good source.
[03:18:34.549 --> 03:18:41.170]  Today, I get another call by someone very close to me, very well known.
[03:18:41.229 --> 03:18:41.909]  They said, we don't care.
[03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:42.549]  Go ahead and say it.
[03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:50.069]  He said, hey, LeBron James just sold his Florida condo two weeks ago and has left the country.
[03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:52.309]  And they got specifically...
[03:18:57.420 --> 03:18:58.540]  You can imagine how.
[03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:03.299]  That it's over P. Diddy.
[03:19:04.020 --> 03:19:06.319]  So, wow, I just broke that.
[03:19:06.500 --> 03:19:06.760]  Sorry.
[03:19:07.459 --> 03:19:10.920]  But God wanted me to get that on air because I get so much stuff.
[03:19:11.420 --> 03:19:14.639]  And, you know, you're four miles up the side of a mountain.
[03:19:16.780 --> 03:19:17.260]  And...
[03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:22.399]  I've got to remember all the other stuff I got while I was off.
[03:19:22.739 --> 03:19:26.000]  I get so busy, I don't return a lot of these calls and stuff when I'm on a regular news cycle.
[03:19:26.079 --> 03:19:28.479]  I'm up here 12 hours a day and then working after that.
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:31.959]  Yeah, there's a bunch of other stuff I learned too about Trump and everything else.
[03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:33.860]  Wow, is that not hardcore?
[03:19:36.420 --> 03:19:40.899]  Oh, I didn't even know this.
[03:19:41.020 --> 03:19:41.819]  Holy Toledo.
[03:19:45.690 --> 03:19:46.569]  Wow, I didn't know.
[03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:51.590]  A week and a half ago, LeBron James, a week ago, steps away from Lakers for personal reasons.
[03:19:53.569 --> 03:19:54.770]  So, here's the takeaway.
[03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:55.250]  Print me that.
[03:19:55.329 --> 03:19:56.629]  I'm shooting a special report on this right off the show.
[03:19:57.350 --> 03:20:01.969]  LeBron James has fled the country over P. Diddy.
[03:20:04.129 --> 03:20:09.250]  Get all the clips of him, too, saying the creepy stuff and trophy posing with kids.
[03:20:10.489 --> 03:20:15.819]  I told you, anybody that arrogant, anybody into themselves like that, I mean, it's so gross.
[03:20:19.979 --> 03:20:22.079]  I wonder if he's pitching or catching.
[03:20:25.700 --> 03:20:39.850]  So, they got a lot of, I'm telling you, I'm telling the left, man, I, you know, and that's why I kept saying in the last six months, well, for years, The government needs reforming.
[03:20:39.930 --> 03:20:41.069]  It needs to be cut in size.
[03:20:41.370 --> 03:20:50.629]  But the average Fed is compartmentalized dealing with bank robberies and child kidnappings and all sorts of crap.
[03:20:51.989 --> 03:21:03.909]  It's the top that's bad, and you don't throw the baby out of the bathwater, because I tell you, I get some of my best information from feds, and I've never had my federal sources give me bad information.
[03:21:04.149 --> 03:21:04.510]  Never.
[03:21:05.610 --> 03:21:10.209]  Because the types that are going to give it to you, bad guys are cowards, and they don't plant disinfo.
[03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:11.290]  They do it in the news.
[03:21:11.629 --> 03:21:30.110]  Good guys, also they're vetted, and I know them and know people that you know, but the point is that you can put what I told you in the bank, From a Fed and someone very close to LeBron James.
[03:21:37.509 --> 03:21:39.690]  Thank God I remember that all the time.
[03:21:39.850 --> 03:21:40.450]  I forget stuff.
[03:21:41.049 --> 03:21:42.270]  Because there's just too much.
[03:21:42.510 --> 03:21:43.770]  Wow, that is huge.
[03:21:44.049 --> 03:21:45.770]  I haven't gotten to the Mayorkas clip yet.
[03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:47.090]  I said I'd cover 15 stories.
[03:21:47.209 --> 03:21:47.950]  I've just been covering one.
[03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.350]  I'm sorry.
[03:21:48.850 --> 03:21:50.049]  I think you understand why.
[03:21:51.549 --> 03:21:57.629]  That's why I hate going too quick through stuff because there's just so many angles.
[03:22:00.409 --> 03:22:05.149]  So, LeBron James has fled the country over P. Diddy.
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:11.700]  And I have that from people very close.
[03:22:12.200 --> 03:22:14.540]  You add that to him leaving the Lakers, all of it.
[03:22:14.659 --> 03:22:16.360]  He is running scared.
[03:22:17.500 --> 03:22:18.340]  And that's good.
[03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:22.799]  Because that means all the other slimes are going to be running too.
[03:22:22.940 --> 03:22:25.319]  Let me play the Marcos clip and come back and I'll be done.
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:29.420]  And I guess when we post this in post, guys, put a little clip up front.
[03:22:30.120 --> 03:22:32.440]  Because this will probably get, you know, 20 million views.
[03:22:32.780 --> 03:22:33.680]  Hell, 100 million.
[03:22:34.479 --> 03:22:34.879]  Um...
[03:22:36.899 --> 03:22:38.579]  I mean, they're running scared.
[03:22:39.579 --> 03:22:43.659]  And so everybody knows, it's been watching for decades, including the bad guys.
[03:22:43.940 --> 03:22:46.500]  I don't sit up here and say stuff that's bull.
[03:22:46.760 --> 03:22:54.459]  And I don't sit up here and tell you what I really think's going on just to make you feel good.
[03:22:54.459 --> 03:22:55.079]  Oh, we're winning.
[03:22:55.239 --> 03:22:55.780]  Oh, they're running.
[03:22:55.979 --> 03:22:56.700]  Oh, they're capitulating.
[03:22:56.940 --> 03:22:57.479]  They are.
[03:22:58.340 --> 03:23:01.340]  I mean, they're bleeding out politically in front of us.
[03:23:01.420 --> 03:23:02.319]  Have you ever...
[03:23:03.059 --> 03:23:09.120]  This is an analogy, I'm talking about violence, but you know, you shoot like a big buck or something and you see it fall over and you see the blood shoot, squirt, squirt, and then the heart stops.
[03:23:09.219 --> 03:23:10.719]  It just goes bloop, bloop, bloop.
[03:23:10.879 --> 03:23:13.760]  The last bits of blood are pumping out of the bullet hole right now.
[03:23:14.420 --> 03:23:16.459]  Bladder rack and burdock root.
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:22.579]  Those aren't very sexy names, but what they do as superfoods is amazing.
[03:23:22.780 --> 03:23:38.940]  Then you add that to the superfood, Irish sea moss, and you were talking about glowing skin, weight loss, Mental clarity, focus, boosted immune system, all your electrochemical systems just operate in such a smooth way.
[03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:43.239]  That's why in the last three or four months, I've lost so much weight.
[03:23:43.379 --> 03:23:44.500]  I was already exercising.
[03:23:44.739 --> 03:23:50.920]  I was already taking some of the other supplements, but I was eating too much and I wasn't getting some of the other key nutrients I needed.
[03:23:51.100 --> 03:24:02.280]  And I'm telling you, when I got on Ultimate CMOS from the AlexJonesStore.com, I saw dramatic effects and I religiously take Two capsules a day, that's the recommended amount.
[03:24:02.600 --> 03:24:07.579]  And that's the equivalent of 40 grams of Irish sea moss concentrated.
[03:24:08.020 --> 03:24:11.360]  And then you get the other superfoods in there as well.
[03:24:11.479 --> 03:24:16.780]  And it would take me 10 minutes to just break down what the other ingredients do, but please research.
[03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:22.090]  These ingredients for yourself and find out why this is such an amazing formula.
[03:24:22.209 --> 03:24:23.469]  And there's other ingredients as well.

[03:25:13.629 --> 03:25:14.909]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:15.129 --> 03:25:20.850]  Multiple sources have told me that LeBron James is planning to leave the country.
[03:25:20.850 --> 03:25:22.250]  He's left social media.
[03:25:22.530 --> 03:25:26.909]  He's told his team that he's going to be leaving for personal reasons.
[03:25:26.930 --> 03:25:27.969]  He played one of his...
[03:25:29.260 --> 03:25:36.040]  Last game, 30-something minutes of it last night, LeBron James steps away from Lakers for personal reasons.
[03:25:36.700 --> 03:25:43.959]  After the Jay-Z news is crazy, fans react amid LeBron James' personal leave of Lakers practice day.
[03:25:45.260 --> 03:25:52.739]  And from my sources, they were told that he's planning to go to Europe and that has gotten rid of his place in Florida.
[03:25:52.739 --> 03:25:54.479]  That was confirmed by my source.
[03:25:54.860 --> 03:25:58.120]  Now, I'm not saying he did anything with P. Diddy.
[03:25:59.430 --> 03:26:03.510]  But he has been getting confronted by fans out in public about it.
[03:26:04.110 --> 03:26:08.610]  And he reportedly has been part of these P. Diddy parties.
[03:26:09.850 --> 03:26:14.090]  But we have a lot of Hollywood people fleeing the country now that Trump's in.
[03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:18.530]  And folks have been saying, is that over the P. Diddy and Epstein style stuff?
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:25.899]  So, what I do know is LeBron James says, I don't care about the Uyghurs being slaves in China, I only care about myself.
[03:26:25.899 --> 03:26:27.280]  That's a monster right there.
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:42.579]  So I wouldn't be personally surprised, but my sources say that he's sold his A penthouse condominium in Florida, and they were told he was planning to move to Europe, but he is not gone yet.
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:46.620]  So we will watch that story as it develops.
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:27:00.889]  What I do know is, Mayorkas has gone on television and said that It's not the jurisdiction of the DHS to care about human trafficking when it's the law that that's one of their main jobs.
[03:27:01.170 --> 03:27:07.670]  And that they facilitated the smuggling with the NGOs and handing these kids out, in many cases, with no paperwork to whoever.
[03:27:08.250 --> 03:27:10.030]  And the organization says, oh, they even know where some of them are.
[03:27:10.049 --> 03:27:12.229]  So he knows Trump and Tom Homan are coming in.
[03:27:13.129 --> 03:27:14.989]  And they're really, really concerned.
[03:27:15.049 --> 03:27:15.709]  Here it is.
[03:27:18.049 --> 03:27:29.270]  ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.
[03:27:29.549 --> 03:27:37.159]  The incoming boarder czar Tom Homan says these children are being exploited and trafficked.
[03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:38.280]  Is that true?
[03:27:38.879 --> 03:27:50.899]  Well, Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.
[03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:55.000]  That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:27:55.250 --> 03:28:02.549]  What we do is we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services.
[03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:05.790]  And then HHS places those children.
[03:28:06.010 --> 03:28:09.809]  Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking.
[03:28:10.209 --> 03:28:12.909]  But there are children.
[03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:21.770]  Who are reunited with a parent here in the United States, or a legal guardian, and they move.
[03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:24.290]  And sometimes the government loses track.
[03:28:24.510 --> 03:28:28.489]  Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.
[03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:34.729]  I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.
[03:28:34.850 --> 03:28:39.069]  There are a number of reasons why we might lose track of an individual.
[03:28:39.270 --> 03:28:42.870]  That is not necessarily specific to this administration.
[03:28:43.270 --> 03:28:47.930]  That has been a long-standing challenge in the immigration system.
[03:28:48.149 --> 03:28:59.610]  One example of why that system is so broken, Why the duration of time in proceedings is unacceptably long and has to be remedied.
[03:28:59.750 --> 03:29:09.709]  Remember, we're dealing with a system that was last reformed in 1996. Nope, it was Obama four years into his administration.
[03:29:11.530 --> 03:29:22.719]  So that'd be 2012. That said, we have a new policy.
[03:29:22.899 --> 03:29:25.079]  Any kids on a company, you get to stay.
[03:29:25.719 --> 03:29:28.219]  So people started using them to get into the country.
[03:29:28.399 --> 03:29:36.639]  Sometimes over and over again, the same kids sent back as a mule, not to carry drugs, in some cases to carry drugs as well, but to be able to get in and out of the country.
[03:29:37.760 --> 03:29:40.739]  And the exploitations on record, and the whistleblowers, and all of it.
[03:29:41.399 --> 03:29:46.620]  And then the people on the planes, hired by the feds, saying in some cases, no paperwork with children as young as three months old.
[03:29:46.799 --> 03:29:47.760]  We've had them in studio.
[03:29:48.020 --> 03:29:49.180]  We played the clips from Congress.
[03:29:50.940 --> 03:29:54.159]  And you got all these drugged out kids coming across and they end the DNA testing.
[03:29:54.379 --> 03:29:55.459]  It is insane.
[03:29:58.139 --> 03:29:59.659]  What these monsters are doing.
[03:29:59.879 --> 03:30:11.620]  Now, just two weeks ago, Kristen Welker interviewing Trump in Paris fact-checked Trump's claim that gangs were taking over apartment complexes.
[03:30:11.620 --> 03:30:17.299]  Now, in the exact area he talked about, 19 arrested for alleged home invasion.
[03:30:18.700 --> 03:30:21.479]  An apartment Trump claimed Venezuelan gang took over.
[03:30:21.639 --> 03:30:22.479]  It was on video.
[03:30:22.719 --> 03:30:23.680]  The police admitted it.
[03:30:25.059 --> 03:30:25.579]  So...
[03:30:26.899 --> 03:30:29.819]  Here's the corporate media still trying to cover this up.
[03:30:29.940 --> 03:30:30.319]  Here it is.
[03:30:31.100 --> 03:30:33.079]  Venezuelan gangs are the worst in the world.
[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:34.600]  They're vicious, violent people.
[03:30:34.819 --> 03:30:37.559]  And you see what they've done in Colorado and other places.
[03:30:37.780 --> 03:30:42.959]  They're taking over, literally taking over apartment complexes and doing it with impunity.
[03:30:43.079 --> 03:30:43.719]  They don't care.
[03:30:43.860 --> 03:30:46.479]  They couldn't, they just are, they're in the real estate.
[03:30:46.579 --> 03:30:49.940]  You know, the local police say that is not the case in Colorado.
[03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:51.139]  Oh, it's totally the case.
[03:30:51.500 --> 03:30:53.200]  You don't believe the local police.
[03:30:53.229 --> 03:30:56.610]  I used to play it at my rallies every single night.
[03:30:56.770 --> 03:30:59.530]  No, they're breaking into doors, they're taking over the building.
[03:30:59.950 --> 03:31:03.670]  And by the way, the police are afraid to do anything.
[03:31:05.549 --> 03:31:08.409]  And there she is trying to deny it.
[03:31:10.209 --> 03:31:10.870]  All right.
[03:31:14.370 --> 03:31:16.350]  I got 20 minutes left in this live broadcast.
[03:31:18.079 --> 03:31:25.200]  I'm going to move quickly through all of these reports after I hit this because I said that I was going to do it and it's important.
[03:31:27.739 --> 03:31:42.340]  Now, a lot of people are going to ask, what are you doing talking about Santa Claus when there's so much serious stuff going on?
[03:31:45.860 --> 03:31:52.500]  Well, I mean, there's no X and Y chromosomes, and the two men can have a baby, and women are as strong as men in sports, and the Easter Bunny's real.
[03:31:52.899 --> 03:31:54.459]  So why not talk about Santa Claus?
[03:31:54.559 --> 03:31:54.760]  No, no.
[03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:55.500]  Seriously.
[03:31:56.139 --> 03:32:11.280]  I saw a report last week, and this guy's dead on, I'll give him on as a guess, that is exposing how we got the fat Santa Claus with the red outfit,
[03:32:11.899 --> 03:32:14.200]  red and white outfit, and the rest of it.
[03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:19.530]  And this is Mainline Marketing 101. You go take marketing at college, this is one of the first things you learn about.
[03:32:20.649 --> 03:32:23.989]  About Edward Bernays and how they did all this.
[03:32:26.170 --> 03:32:37.209]  So, Coca-Cola, before World War II, but then they really were able to launch it after World War II, and that's when it got successful.
[03:32:39.109 --> 03:32:50.370]  Wanted to make Christmas a bigger holiday because Coca-Cola and other soft drinks were selling in the summer and the spring and the fall, but mainly the summer.
[03:32:50.370 --> 03:32:53.690]  They were associated with cool and refreshing, and they had cocaine in it.
[03:32:54.409 --> 03:33:01.709]  So they'd taken the cocaine out by then, the mystery ingredient, Coca-Cola, it's hiding in plain view, and Dr. Pepper had cocaine in it as well.
[03:33:01.909 --> 03:33:06.329]  Some of them had opium in them, but most of them were stimulants.
[03:33:07.840 --> 03:33:12.520]  But by the 20s, they took the cocaine out.
[03:33:14.360 --> 03:33:19.420]  And they started restricting laudanum or opium as well.
[03:33:20.440 --> 03:33:28.559]  And so Coca-Cola went and merged a bunch of characters from history together to make Santa Claus.
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:37.399]  Now, most people alive today, even if you're 90 years old, Santa Claus is Santa Claus.
[03:33:37.520 --> 03:33:38.819]  You just think that's always been there.
[03:33:40.399 --> 03:33:42.899]  You don't think about the etymology of something.
[03:33:44.180 --> 03:33:57.739]  But if you understand how Coca-Cola was able to take Christmas from being a low-budget holiday that was not that big of an event, was about family and going to church and having a meal...
[03:33:59.579 --> 03:34:01.459]  Gifts really weren't even a part of it.
[03:34:01.579 --> 03:34:10.819]  Maybe you'd give people some nuts or oranges as a little snack for kids, candy.
[03:34:11.139 --> 03:34:12.340]  But that was it.
[03:34:13.260 --> 03:34:18.520]  And they created this whole thing about Santa and reindeer and red-nose the reindeer.
[03:34:18.799 --> 03:34:21.079]  And so it's just part of our culture.
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:23.399]  Now, why is this important?
[03:34:24.139 --> 03:34:25.719]  Well, it displaced Christ.
[03:34:25.920 --> 03:34:26.760]  It displaced family.
[03:34:26.899 --> 03:34:27.440]  It displaced God.
[03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:29.139]  I'm not attacking Santa Claus, okay?
[03:34:31.270 --> 03:34:33.090]  But then, what did Coca-Cola tell you?
[03:34:33.149 --> 03:34:37.389]  And they put out magazines and publications about how he comes down the chimney and all the rest of it.
[03:34:38.010 --> 03:34:41.329]  It's about lying to your children and telling them a fable.
[03:34:42.750 --> 03:34:46.469]  And once you accept that lie, well, you'll now accept any lie to tell your children.
[03:34:47.549 --> 03:34:49.530]  And I'm not judging people that have fun with their kids.
[03:34:49.629 --> 03:35:03.430]  The point is, is that Then the lie becomes, two men can have a baby, there's no X and Y chromosomes, and the new PR push, and there's been many, is, oh, Bruce Jenner's now Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:35:03.530 --> 03:35:04.350]  Don't be mean to him.
[03:35:04.350 --> 03:35:05.409]  He's stunning and brave.
[03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:08.709]  Support an old man saying he's now a woman.
[03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:11.750]  And you're like, oh, I'm not hateful.
[03:35:11.850 --> 03:35:12.270]  It's okay.
[03:35:12.489 --> 03:35:21.270]  Now you've just supported castrating little boys, chemical sterilization, this whole depopulation agenda, mainly targeting autistic and retarded children.
[03:35:23.079 --> 03:35:27.760]  And the schools secretly brainwashing, public and private, getting grant money, corporate and government, to do it.
[03:35:28.340 --> 03:35:29.280]  It's the same thing.
[03:35:29.420 --> 03:35:30.979]  It's a giant PR rollout.
[03:35:31.100 --> 03:35:32.079]  You take cigarettes.
[03:35:34.459 --> 03:35:41.920]  Women saw cigarettes as gross until the suffrage movement a little over 100 years ago.
[03:35:42.299 --> 03:35:44.959]  And then the amendment that got women the right to vote.
[03:35:46.899 --> 03:35:52.260]  And Amber Bernays is taught in mainline college for marketing and journalism.
[03:35:54.100 --> 03:35:55.719]  That's Sigmund Freud's nephew.
[03:35:58.139 --> 03:36:03.920]  He said, let's sponsor the suffrage movements, pay for their trips, pay for their banners, pay for their things.
[03:36:04.879 --> 03:36:12.520]  But had them call it Liberty Torches and had the women smoke cigarettes for newspaper photos and tell women, be radical, go smoke a cigarette.
[03:36:12.819 --> 03:36:18.500]  And it went on from there with Virginia Slim, you know, in the 80s and 90s saying, you've come a long way, honey, smoking a cigarette.
[03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:25.719]  And they knew it killed you, they knew it gave you cancer, and they knew all that, but it was just, hey, tie it to the rebellion, tie it to women's freedom, tie it to that.
[03:36:26.959 --> 03:36:32.930]  And then Bernays, you know, Worked for the Pentagon, and he said, why call yourselves the Department of War?
[03:36:33.350 --> 03:36:35.870]  Call yourselves the Defense Department.
[03:36:37.450 --> 03:36:39.549]  So all of this stuff comes out of this.
[03:36:39.649 --> 03:36:55.469]  So if they can sell a big fat elf in a red and white suit that comes down your chimney, and everybody believes this is what really Christmas is about, with marketing, they can sell anything, like carbon taxes, and tracking you with computers, and taxing everything you do, and making you eat bugs,
[03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:56.610]  if they make it cool.
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:37:05.440]  That's why you've seen all the Hollywood people all over the world, From Europe, here, everywhere, whoever the stars are, they're going, oh, bugs are so good, eat bugs, telling kids eat bugs.
[03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:07.159]  They're rolling something out.
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:14.040]  And if you realize it's a PR campaign, and you realize it's a takeover of society, this isn't something quasi-harmless like Santa Claus.
[03:37:15.260 --> 03:37:16.459]  This is evil.
[03:37:17.540 --> 03:37:21.000]  And it shows what happens to young people if they're indoctrinated.
[03:37:21.139 --> 03:37:25.520]  So kids aren't being indoctrinated with Santa Claus coming down the chimney and giving cookies and milk.
[03:37:25.520 --> 03:37:26.620]  It's really for mom and dad.
[03:37:26.899 --> 03:37:28.659]  And it's fun to have presents and all that.
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:29.620]  You really just go into debt.
[03:37:29.719 --> 03:37:30.680]  It's the most stressful time of the year.
[03:37:31.959 --> 03:37:34.399]  So the whole industry got into it as a marketing ploy.
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:37.600]  I'm just saying be aware of the process.
[03:37:42.399 --> 03:37:44.719]  So here is an excellent breakdown.
[03:37:46.209 --> 03:37:50.889]  An incredible marketing tactic by Coca-Cola and the origins of Santa Claus.
[03:37:50.989 --> 03:37:54.430]  And then look at DEI and transgenderism.
[03:37:54.549 --> 03:38:01.190]  They're all marketing campaigns to sell a lifestyle that makes you alone and controlled inside the medical system.
[03:38:01.950 --> 03:38:06.329]  This is Coca-Cola and Santa Claus 2.0 we're witnessing.
[03:38:06.350 --> 03:38:12.360]  And if you're aware of the scam and realize what it is, And teach your children about it, then you're immune to it.
[03:38:12.659 --> 03:38:14.559]  And it's understanding how this stuff...
[03:38:14.559 --> 03:38:15.819]  And most people are like, we already know this.
[03:38:15.940 --> 03:38:16.959]  I'm talking to the new viewers.
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:22.659]  Because they didn't sell you something quasi-harmless like Santa Claus.
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:24.719]  They sold you pure death.
[03:38:24.899 --> 03:38:25.219]  Here it is.
[03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:32.239]  125 years ago, Coca-Cola was doing the math on its sales.
[03:38:33.680 --> 03:38:36.940]  I believe by that point it already abandoned the cocaine content.
[03:38:37.299 --> 03:38:38.879]  It was just cola at that point.
[03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:43.659]  But once you name something cocaine cola, how do you ever walk back from that?
[03:38:44.020 --> 03:38:44.540]  You know what I mean?
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:45.719]  It's too good of a name.
[03:38:47.020 --> 03:38:47.479]  So...
[03:38:48.969 --> 03:38:49.930]  They noticed something.
[03:38:50.250 --> 03:38:52.090]  People bought Coca-Cola in the summer.
[03:38:52.450 --> 03:38:55.649]  A little bit in the fall, a little bit in the spring, not in the winter.
[03:38:56.049 --> 03:38:58.049]  People didn't think of it as a winter drink.
[03:38:58.709 --> 03:39:15.389]  So the Coca-Cola advertisers were like, well, wouldn't it be great if we could somehow trick people or convince people or talk people or coax or whatever, brainwash people into drinking Coca-Cola in the winter too.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:20.600]  So here's what Coca-Cola advertisers came up with.
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:28.899]  They thought, what if we somehow worked Coca-Cola into Christmas?
[03:39:30.670 --> 03:39:32.049]  Now, I know what you're thinking.
[03:39:32.209 --> 03:39:33.430]  Christmas is such a big deal.
[03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:35.229]  Not back then.
[03:39:35.850 --> 03:39:39.209]  Back then, Easter was the big deal.
[03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:40.709]  Christmas was important.
[03:39:41.229 --> 03:39:46.469]  People would go do mass to commemorate Christ's birth, but everybody's born.
[03:39:46.850 --> 03:39:52.309]  The real interesting thing is to be killed, executed, and then come back two days later.
[03:39:52.729 --> 03:39:56.909]  That's fascinating, which is why people had focused on Easter.
[03:39:57.819 --> 03:40:05.659]  So what the Coca-Cola advertisers did was, they found a saint who was about to be decanonized, Santa Claus.
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:10.559]  The Catholic Church was like, he hasn't performed a miracle in a while, let's unemploy him.
[03:40:11.139 --> 03:40:19.639]  They grabbed him, they merged him with the story of Saint Nick, and then somebody got inspired.
[03:40:20.180 --> 03:40:24.440]  And the inspiration was to merge him with Kris Kringle.
[03:40:24.620 --> 03:40:27.280]  Kris Kringle was a Danish thief.
[03:40:28.409 --> 03:40:31.389]  Whose job in the day was a chimney sweep.
[03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:37.250]  He could pop his shoulders out and he could fit down a chimney.
[03:40:37.549 --> 03:40:42.090]  He would rob your house and then work his way back up, but you'd have a clean chimney.
[03:40:43.370 --> 03:40:52.909]  And they merged this together, but they then took St. Nicholas out of, he was usually portrayed as a young man and skinny young man in green and brown clothing.
[03:40:53.209 --> 03:40:55.250]  They stuck him in Coca-Cola colors.
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:40:57.440]  Red and white.
[03:40:58.159 --> 03:41:05.600]  They even decided to give him some pink in his skin to keep the Coca-Cola colors going.
[03:41:05.860 --> 03:41:08.159]  So they made him an old man so he could have white hair.
[03:41:08.899 --> 03:41:10.780]  And then they stuck him on the bottom.
[03:41:12.680 --> 03:41:20.600]  That's why periodically you'll see Santa Claus on a Coca-Cola bottle or Coca-Cola can around Christmas time.
[03:41:21.059 --> 03:41:22.700]  Because they made him up.
[03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:26.069]  And they transformed Christmas.
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:34.440]  So instead of Christmas being an important event, but not an especially emotional event and especially involved event, necessarily.
[03:41:34.659 --> 03:41:39.299]  I mean, there were nice traditions around it, stockings and maybe a Christmas tree.
[03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:48.120]  They turned it into this thing where all of a sudden this mythical being who drinks a lot of Coca-Cola is bringing you presents.
[03:41:48.579 --> 03:41:54.479]  I guess that's how he stays up so late, because think about how many hours it would take to bring presents to everybody.
[03:41:55.709 --> 03:42:02.149]  And in the process now, the average Christian in the United States, at least, thinks Christmas is the important Christian holiday.
[03:42:03.129 --> 03:42:09.750]  And it's forced other religions to think about what holiday they could promote during that time period, like Hanukkah.
[03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:11.629]  Hanukkah was never especially important.
[03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:13.430]  I mean, it's important, but not like...
[03:42:13.430 --> 03:42:22.569]  You wouldn't revolve like a whole bunch of time and energy and effort around it, but then, right, if you're Jewish and you're like looking at your kids going, we wish we had a Christmas tree.
[03:42:22.989 --> 03:42:24.709]  You need something to compete with this.
[03:42:25.430 --> 03:42:33.969]  And the next thing you know, there's a Kwanzaa because of Coca-Cola advertisers trying to get you to drink more Coca-Cola.
[03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:35.690]  They've changed our religion.
[03:42:36.010 --> 03:42:37.209]  They've changed our culture.
[03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:40.209]  They've changed us economically.
[03:42:41.010 --> 03:42:46.069]  So you can imagine what happens when you have a government deliberately thinking about these things.
[03:42:47.530 --> 03:42:49.750]  And that is Roy Casagranda.
[03:42:49.950 --> 03:42:52.030]  He's been a professor right here in Austin, Texas.
[03:42:52.170 --> 03:42:54.409]  Definitely want to get him on the show.
[03:42:55.149 --> 03:43:11.870]  And that is just such an important thing to understand historically to pierce how marketing, if people aren't aware of what's really going on, can become total culture, mind control, and can erase what something was actually started as and replace it with something else, and people don't even know what hit them.
[03:43:12.129 --> 03:43:13.989]  And again, this is just everywhere.
[03:43:15.020 --> 03:43:18.319]  They destroy something by replacing it with something else.
[03:43:19.059 --> 03:43:24.000]  And so you'll hear about some great reason, oh, the kids are all committing suicide if we don't chop their genitals off.
[03:43:24.340 --> 03:43:29.739]  No, statistically, the people that the system gets, they do that to commit suicide at the highest rates because they're in a death cult.
[03:43:31.079 --> 03:43:40.440]  But people don't point that out with the real numbers or the facts or the research because you don't want to be involved in killing kids even though they're the ones that are getting the kids killed.
[03:43:42.799 --> 03:43:43.520]  Alright, look.
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:44.559]  Man.
[03:43:50.420 --> 03:43:51.819]  Let's just hit all this right now.
[03:43:53.139 --> 03:43:54.399]  Boy, there is a lot of it.
[03:43:55.459 --> 03:43:56.819]  I'll have to shoot some special reports.
[03:43:56.899 --> 03:43:57.620]  Plus, I'll be back tomorrow.
[03:43:59.059 --> 03:43:59.760]  Look at this.
[03:43:59.899 --> 03:44:01.159]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[03:44:01.700 --> 03:44:07.020]  Bill Gates' creepy, costly plan to destroy the atmosphere and store CO2 underground moves forward in Canada.
[03:44:07.420 --> 03:44:11.040]  Sucking carbon dioxide that's life-giving out of the air using taxpayer money to do it.
[03:44:12.430 --> 03:44:17.690]  UN amplifies campaign against disinformation and AI through global governance framework.
[03:44:19.170 --> 03:44:20.870]  Global government to censor you.
[03:44:20.969 --> 03:44:22.309]  Big article, InfoWars.com.
[03:44:22.690 --> 03:44:26.430]  Trump is not happy after House passes bill without his ask.
[03:44:48.319 --> 03:44:50.040]  I don't want to invade any countries.
[03:44:50.219 --> 03:44:51.059]  I don't want to take any land.
[03:44:51.139 --> 03:44:51.639]  Neither does Trump.
[03:44:52.889 --> 03:44:57.430]  But Jimmy Carter didn't have the power to give it away, and we can't have China running it.
[03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:58.649]  That's a strategic issue.
[03:44:58.950 --> 03:45:02.870]  And so I'm all for Trump taking what we built that is ours.
[03:45:03.549 --> 03:45:05.569]  Again, our government did that.
[03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:08.469]  Our government, hijacked by globalists, did that.
[03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:14.389]  And so we'll be covering that more as it unfolds as well.
[03:45:17.040 --> 03:45:18.260]  There's a lot more here.
[03:45:18.639 --> 03:45:20.059]  A lot more capitulation.
[03:45:20.239 --> 03:45:25.700]  Senator Fetterman expertly shuts down ABC hacks suggesting Donald Trump is a fascist.
[03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:28.239]  Again, that's more of these established people capitulating.
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:29.479]  And that's good.
[03:45:29.819 --> 03:45:30.879]  We need to fix this.
[03:45:30.979 --> 03:45:35.360]  Let me show you this article, or this post by Chase Geiser.
[03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:35.819]  I looked it up.
[03:45:35.879 --> 03:45:36.239]  It's true.
[03:45:37.659 --> 03:45:38.860]  MSNBC in crisis.
[03:45:39.139 --> 03:45:42.100]  Joy Reid, no, not sporting the Trump wig.
[03:45:42.799 --> 03:45:45.979]  And others face pay cuts amid ratings drop.
[03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:53.290]  At MSNBC. Oh, Rachel Maddow's getting cut from 30, 25 million.
[03:45:53.809 --> 03:45:55.809]  Their average show has less than 50 million viewers.
[03:45:56.010 --> 03:45:58.110]  I mean, 50,000 viewers, excuse me.
[03:45:58.629 --> 03:46:04.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've never had a big audience.
[03:46:04.329 --> 03:46:06.590]  But it's tinier than it ever was.
[03:46:06.729 --> 03:46:07.469]  It's a shadow of a shadow.
[03:46:07.649 --> 03:46:12.909]  But they pay them all this and have these big facades to convince you that the system hasn't collapsed.
[03:46:12.909 --> 03:46:15.629]  But now that they can't steal elections as easy...
[03:46:16.780 --> 03:46:19.459]  They don't even need the facade that you really voted for the Democrats.
[03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:20.799]  They don't even need the facade anymore.
[03:46:21.600 --> 03:46:25.780]  And that's why most of these leftist publications are shutting down.
[03:46:25.899 --> 03:46:32.579]  But CNN and MSNBC are still propped up because the system needs to try to keep that illusion going a little bit longer.
[03:46:32.739 --> 03:46:39.059]  But take Rachel Maddow getting paid $30 million a year and not counting sponsorship money.
[03:46:39.200 --> 03:46:41.239]  She got $87,000 per episode.
[03:46:41.239 --> 03:46:44.700]  She promoted Pfizer saying if you take the shot, you can't get sick and you can't spread it.
[03:46:46.190 --> 03:46:47.329]  That's false advertising.
[03:46:47.329 --> 03:46:47.950]  That's fraud.
[03:46:48.090 --> 03:46:48.690]  That's lies.
[03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:52.190]  She's part of the crimes against humanity.
[03:46:52.850 --> 03:46:55.489]  But it takes about $30 million a year to run InfoWars.
[03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:57.409]  The server costs, the crew, the legal, all of it.
[03:46:57.770 --> 03:47:01.450]  Think about all we do reaching 50, 60, 70 million people a day with the show.
[03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:03.069]  Tens of millions more with the clips.
[03:47:03.510 --> 03:47:04.989]  30 million for the whole thing.
[03:47:06.139 --> 03:47:08.159]  That's why your support is so precious.
[03:47:08.200 --> 03:47:12.100]  And when you don't support InfoWars or you don't support Trump, you're not supporting yourself.
[03:47:12.100 --> 03:47:13.940]  But I want to make it easy for you to support.
[03:47:14.639 --> 03:47:17.379]  Very exciting announcement I made at the start of the second hour.
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:19.120]  If you missed it, I'm telling you now.
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:22.120]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is not owned by me.
[03:47:22.200 --> 03:47:23.180]  It's owned by a great sponsor.
[03:47:24.280 --> 03:47:29.579]  Even if InfoWars gets shut down, it's going to fund the Alex Jones Network and the new studios and all of it that are already...
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:31.979]  The bigger studio is almost done.
[03:47:32.120 --> 03:47:33.139]  You've already seen a smaller one.
[03:47:33.459 --> 03:47:36.159]  We're able to reach all the radio stations, all the TV stations, and continue on.
[03:47:36.299 --> 03:47:38.360]  We're not giving up, but you're our backer.
[03:47:38.500 --> 03:47:41.000]  So, go to the alishjonesstore.com.
[03:47:41.219 --> 03:47:42.420]  Here is the new announcement.
[03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:51.219]  Up in the right-hand corner, right by the VIP membership, where you get, for $30 a month, cancel any time, $40 to spend in the store.
[03:47:52.069 --> 03:47:58.329]  Right next to that is the affiliate program with a huge 10% of the sale.
[03:47:58.729 --> 03:47:59.670]  Not of what we make.
[03:47:59.930 --> 03:48:01.190]  10% off the top.
[03:48:01.329 --> 03:48:02.170]  That's huge.
[03:48:03.190 --> 03:48:05.469]  Because there's not a lot of markup in most of the products there.
[03:48:06.069 --> 03:48:08.790]  Like the supplements or the Patriot apparel.
[03:48:08.989 --> 03:48:11.649]  There isn't things that say fundraiser like the posters.
[03:48:11.989 --> 03:48:12.909]  Limited edition posters.
[03:48:13.129 --> 03:48:17.129]  That this whole group of limited edition posters will no longer be sold on January 6th.
[03:48:17.129 --> 03:48:17.989]  That's just the date I picked.
[03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:20.159]  So there is big markup there.
[03:48:20.239 --> 03:48:21.379]  If you really want to support us, get it.
[03:48:21.459 --> 03:48:22.459]  It's Memento hanging on the wall.
[03:48:22.540 --> 03:48:26.620]  But everything else, super competitive, super low prices, great products you're going to love, so you want to get them again and again.
