[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.481]  Biden is out and Kamala is in.
[00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:23.304]  The election went from drool runnings to cool runnings faster than a female cop can fumble her firearm.
[00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:29.206]  Move over RFK, this November we've got a new throat goat and apparently her headshots don't miss.
[00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:39.812]   Kamala Harris, or as we call her, Warhawk The half-black, half-Indian parents met at a 7-Eleven robbery is officially the Democratic nominee.
[00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:47.717]  Surely the Dems, the party that calls Trump the end of democracy, surely they allowed the voters to choose, Kamala, right?
[00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:48.157]  What?
[00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:48.877]  No?
[00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.098]  Wait, there's no right to choose?
[00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.921]  Guys, this is a presidential election, not a woman's body in Oklahoma.
[00:00:54.981 --> 00:01:00.804]  Now, I don't want to seem like a flat-earthing, dinosaur-denying, believe-all-women conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:11.428]  But it kind of feels like the Democrats dragged Biden's lifeless corpse through the campaign long enough to avoid a primary so they could place whoever they wanted as the nominee.
[00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:14.469]  And that's about as democratic as North Korea's got talent.
[00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:18.478]  sidebar last year's winner, Ching Chong chestnut.
[00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:25.588]  Congratulations. Ching Chong.
[00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:26.554]  That's a lot of rats.
[00:01:26.614 --> 00:01:28.896]  We'll look forward to seeing how many you eat next year.
[00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.619]  What I'm saying is, they used a vegetable to install a plant.
[00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.341]  And honestly, we would have been happier with a fruit.
[00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.222]  But the reality is, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:39.564]  Last week, Trump became invincible.
[00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:40.485]  Literally.
[00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:43.607]  He was leading before, and now he's number one with a bullet.
[00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:48.190]  At this point, if the Dems wanted to beat Thrifty Cent, they'd have to run George Washington.
[00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.912]  And Kamala could work for him, paid.
[00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:53.774]  Now, why is Trump invincible?
[00:01:54.175 --> 00:02:06.464]  Because he has the power of Hulkamania, obviously, brother, with a hard R. And also, because this pimple-lipped, pug-faced incel, we'll call him a trench bulldog, tried to make Trump's brain public domain.
[00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:10.048]  Fortunately, even a bullet couldn't make Donald open-minded.
[00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:15.133]  Now, getting a shot off at the president must be an incredibly difficult thing to accomplish.
[00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:18.637]  I mean, not as difficult as finding binoculars to fit his eyes.
[00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:21.020]  Jesus, he looks like the sloth from Ice Age.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.266]  But he must have designed a pretty ingenious plot to circumvent the Secret Service and... Oh, what's that?
[00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.214]  Wait, you're saying that Herpy Potter was just walking around with a loaded gun like he was on an Alec Baldwin set?
[00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.177]  He was carrying a fucking ladder and a rangefinder?
[00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:42.642]  He propped it up on a building that had cops in it, positioned himself on the roof with a perfect sight line to the president, and no one did anything?
[00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:46.926]  This Mickey Mouse security detail was so goofy it made Donald duck.
[00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:47.947]  Oh boy!
[00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.048]  Who was in charge of the Secret Service?
[00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:51.649]  A lady?
[00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:52.389]  Wait, what?
[00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:53.269]  Seriously?
[00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.690]  Well, of course she didn't have anyone on top of the building.
[00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.492]  Women only care about shots on a roof when there's a pool party.
[00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:05.175]  Now, I don't want to seem like a bigfoot tracking, moon landing, denying Jews don't control the weather conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:13.661]  But it doesn't exactly feel like a 20-year-old fetal alcohol-faced McLovin should be able to infiltrate the most advanced security detail in history.
[00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.483]  I mean, the only other thing he's penetrated was his palm.
[00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:19.445]  Did Kim Cheadle hire Epstein's NyQuil nightwatch?
[00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:21.266]  What the fuck is going on here?
[00:03:21.306 --> 00:03:22.647]  This just doesn't feel right.
[00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:24.409]  And that's the problem.
[00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.811]  Nothing feels right.
[00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.674]  We have officially entered the post-truth age.
[00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:31.075]  We can't trust the media.
[00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:32.997]  We can't trust the government.
[00:03:33.117 --> 00:03:34.939]  We can't trust the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.480]  We can't even trust the food we eat.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.721]  So who can you trust?
[00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:38.943]  Me.
[00:03:39.684 --> 00:03:40.825]  Your good friend, Chelsea.
[00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:43.327]  This episode has been brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:44.768]  There is no promo code.
[00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:45.849]  There's nothing to fill out.
[00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.110]  They're already inside you.
[00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.254]  But before we bitch, whine, and complain, just remember, like it or not, this is what we asked for.
[00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:56.237]  We wanted fast content that makes us feel good.
[00:03:56.577 --> 00:03:58.278]  We want politicians who lied to us.
[00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.841]  We want sugary food to fill us up and pills to slim us down.
[00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:03.182]  We don't want what's good for us.
[00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:04.523]  We want what's convenient.
[00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:05.944]  So we made our bed.
[00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:07.466]  Might as well get comfy.
[00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:08.846]  Sleep tight.
[00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.907]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:15.347]  I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:20.048]  We've got so much great news to cover over the course of the next four hours that we will be together.
[00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:24.749]  I will be hosting the Alex Jones Show as well as Sunday Night Live, as I usually do.
[00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.110]  Alex will be back in studio tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.550]  Central Time, so make sure that you stay tuned for that.
[00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.311]  So we have one break coming up for one minute in 20 seconds.
[00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:34.451]  Please open up a new tab.
[00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:43.615]  Pull up on your phone, infowarsstore.com or drjonesnaturals.com, that's drjonesnaturals.com, and be the reason that we are still on the air.
[00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:46.176]  Stay tuned for more on the other side of this one-minute break.
[00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:49.958]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:53.760]  Good evening, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the duration of the evening.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.361]  We will be on air together for the next four hours.
[00:04:57.022 --> 00:05:00.904]  We'll do two or three hours of news, followed by your phone calls for sure.
[00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:03.405]  Sunday night calls are among my favorite.
[00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:09.362]  Cause I'm so used to doing morning shows or filling in during the day, but the nighttime callers, it's a whole different vibe.
[00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:15.744]  It's, it's like some art bell material from the old coast to coast days or something like that.
[00:05:16.764 --> 00:05:22.585]  Well, I don't even know where to begin because this weekend has just been a litany of Satanism and globalism.
[00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:29.644]   And it occurred to me as I was watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics that there's
[00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:32.884]  nothing really more globalist than the Olympics.
[00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:39.444]   By definition, it's this idea that all the nations will come together for this sports,
[00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:44.483]   good sportsmanship competition and see which nations are the best at different athletic
[00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:45.483]  events.
[00:05:45.483 --> 00:05:50.524]   And it's going to be this symbol of peace and harmony and our ability to communicate
[00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:54.965]   and interact with each other and how it's all one species and it's all one world.
[00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:58.244]   And it's just this harmonious thing where we can compete and be friends at the end.
[00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:01.843]   And we hand out these little medallions, these little medals, and we pat each other on the
[00:06:01.843 --> 00:06:06.404]   back and we talk about the different athletes and their accomplishments and remark on the
[00:06:06.404 --> 00:06:10.564]   records of the past and show clips of years and years ago and compare the performance
[00:06:10.564 --> 00:06:13.843]   of the figure skaters of this year versus the figure skaters of...
[00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.591]  The Olympics in the 1930s, and wow, how far have athletes come over the course of the last 100 years.
[00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:33.813]  But when push comes to shove, if you actually analyze the Olympics, and I'm not opposed to international teams coming together and competing, but it really is just kind of bullshit.
[00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:46.695]   It's this excuse that nations make to tax the snot out of their people to Have a lottery somewhat of a lottery process.
[00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:50.899]  I know it's selected by committee as to which city, which country is going to host the Olympics.
[00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:56.363]  And then it's a massive influx of tourist dollars into that city.
[00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:04.326]   And all these athletes come and it's an excuse for these governments to spend millions upon
[00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:09.386]   millions if not, I wouldn't even be surprised if not by now over a billion dollars on these
[00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:13.906]   events and we know that all of the government spending throughout the entire world, whether
[00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:20.266]   it's in the United States or in other countries is riddled with money laundering and corruption
[00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:29.326]   and conspiracy to just engage in nepotism one form or another.
[00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:35.665]   They get together and they do these bizarre opening ceremonies and they've just gotten
[00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:36.665]  weirder and weirder.
[00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:41.105]  I'm going to show you a couple of them.
[00:07:41.105 --> 00:07:51.105]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:48.237]  But even in 2012, this is clip number four.
[00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:57.621]  Even in 2012, it was almost as if they were predicting the COVID pandemic with this opening ceremony.
[00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:04.564]  So this isn't the first time that we've seen a macabre, satanic opening ceremony for the Olympics.
[00:08:04.724 --> 00:08:05.705]  Look at what happened in 2012.
[00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:10.589]  Scary demons spreading like a virus.
[00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.611]  Zombie-like healthcare workers.
[00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:18.612]  Terrified children.
[00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:30.492]  [Music]
[00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:32.491]  Death.
[00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:37.491]  [Music]
[00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:39.491]  Why show the NHS?
[00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:42.491]  [Music]
[00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:56.346]  Why all the subliminal messages during the closing ceremony about anger, death, rage, and the end of the world?
[00:08:57.827 --> 00:09:02.369]  Can anybody please explain to us what any of this has to do with sports?
[00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:04.270]  With the Olympic Games?
[00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:15.353]  Who could have known back then that their so-called artistic show was actually an appalling glimpse into our future?
[00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:18.055]  We can never say we didn't know.
[00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:24.600]  We were warned all along, just like they've already warned us about the next outbreak.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.303]  We'll have to prepare for the next one.
[00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:33.881]   And that, you know, I'd say is, uh, will get attention this time.
[00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:42.641]   Basically, this so-called You guys got the point.
[00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.203]  There's been bizarre stuff going on.
[00:09:44.243 --> 00:09:50.732]  The crew was telling me that back in 1992 there was some bizarre Olympic opening ceremony too that was much like a pandemic theme.
[00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:53.515]  But why can't we just do it like Russia?
[00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:55.597]  Russia did it better.
[00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:59.220]  I want to show you what an opening ceremony could look like.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:17.893]  Something that reflects respectfully one's own culture in a way that it pays homage to one's own culture while inviting and welcoming and celebrating these other countries coming and visiting, but still being proud of your own national identity, still being proud to be whatever country you come from.
[00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:27.097]   So if we had an American Olympics, we would have something that would Really reflect what it means to be American in a way that is proud, but also welcoming and exciting and celebratory.
[00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:35.960]  Instead of this globalist, dystopian, apocalyptic garbage that we've seen where they mock religion and then they try to walk it back.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.320]  We'll talk a little bit about that by saying, oh, it wasn't the last supper.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.621]  It was another painting that was from 18 years after the last supper was painted.
[00:10:42.562 --> 00:10:44.022]  Just baloney.
[00:10:44.062 --> 00:10:45.703]  But let's, let's look at how Russia did it.
[00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:46.722]  This is 62.
[00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:54.722]  [MUSIC]
[00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:58.722]   I swear, the more I see from Russia, the more I just hope they invade all of Europe.
[00:10:58.722 --> 00:11:05.722]  [MUSIC]
[00:11:05.787 --> 00:11:08.851]  What problem does Europe have that wouldn't be solved by a Russian occupation?
[00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:17.111]   I'd rather see it occupied by Orthodox Russians than radical Islamists.
[00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:37.111]  [Music]
[00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:41.111]  Andrei Polkonsky has appeared from the heart of Natasha.
[00:11:41.111 --> 00:11:43.111]  (music)
[00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:49.691]  Prince Andrei, with a thoughtful and low bow, approached Natasha.
[00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:51.832]  He offered her a waltz tour.
[00:11:51.872 --> 00:12:04.875]  That freezing expression on Natasha's face, ready for despair and delight, suddenly shone with a happy, grateful, childlike smile.
[00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:06.479]   It seems What happened yesterday?
[00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:09.240]  Do you think it happened to us?
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.180]  Poor Pierre is retreating.
[00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:12.139]  Did something happen to us?
[00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:23.139]   The unhappy faith is turning away Unable to resist
[00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:28.139]   The unhappiness is turning away Unable to resist
[00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:34.139]   The unhappiness is turning away Unable to resist
[00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:40.139]   The unhappiness is turning away Unable to resist
[00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:46.139]   The unhappiness is turning away Unable to resist
[00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:52.139]   And I know this is a longer clip, it's just a couple of minutes, but it warrants it.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.961]  It's truly beautiful.
[00:12:53.201 --> 00:13:04.948]  These are masters of their craft who have trained their entire lives to learn how to do something incredibly difficult with an incredible degree of perfection.
[00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:09.493]  This is the definition of self-actualization.
[00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:22.809]  When you identify what it is that you're meant to do, you dedicate your life to it and you do it at such an astounding level that it inspires something in every single human all over the world instead of this macabre crap.
[00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:46.035]  With Baphomet and some goat dude in front of the Last Supper celebrating transgenderism, celebrating obesity, all that which is unhealthy, all of that cultural erosion that has been the predecessor of every collapse of every major civilization so far as we have documented and written human history.
[00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:57.251]   And I suspect that we might have had great civilizations that Aren't even written about in written history as we know it from thousands of years ago that destroyed themselves.
[00:13:57.572 --> 00:14:05.859]  But cultural decadence is the foreshadowing of total collapse.
[00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:08.842]  Even Tacitus wrote about this.
[00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:10.644]  I believe it was Tacitus wrote about this.
[00:14:11.104 --> 00:14:14.988]  He was in Rome and he was saying, look, these Germans are going to be a real problem for us.
[00:14:15.008 --> 00:14:20.718]   This is an ancient Rome because They're just married to one person their entire lives.
[00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:22.059]  They're dedicated to their families.
[00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.459]  They have values.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.880]  And Rome has become hedonistic.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.181]  Rome has become decadent.
[00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:32.843]  All we care about is debauchery and orgies and wine and our false gods.
[00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:36.585]  And he wrote about, and I'm paraphrasing of course, but he wrote about this in his history, Tacitus.
[00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:43.108]  I had to read about it in my ancient civilization course in college.
[00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:45.909]  And he saw it coming.
[00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:52.696]  And the same thing happened in the 1920s in Berlin, in the Weimar Republic.
[00:14:53.156 --> 00:15:08.428]  During the Roaring Twenties, happened in the United States too, there was this decadence, it was all this drinking and this elite class that could just totally transcend all of the laws and drink as much alcohol as they wanted even though it was prohibition and they were just engaged in this debauchery like something out of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.
[00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:14.793]  And then it immediately leads to this collapse in 1929, everybody's jumping out of buildings, committing suicide.
[00:15:16.204 --> 00:15:18.926]  Alcoholism is rampant then because it's the Great Depression.
[00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:23.409]  I think it was the 1930s, maybe it was earlier, that the big blue book was written, the Alcoholics Anonymous book.
[00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.633]  There's certainly stories in it from all the way far back into the 30s.
[00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:34.497]  And then this total collapse, what does it always end up leading to?
[00:15:35.138 --> 00:15:36.539]  Regardless of the civilization?
[00:15:36.558 --> 00:15:42.958]   Well, it almost always leads to, if not every single time, incredible violence at unprecedented
[00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.519]  scales.
[00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:47.519]   Whether it's World War I, whether it's World War II, whether it's World War III, which
[00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:53.639]   is coming right up, whether it's all the wars that Rome was involved in during its collapse,
[00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:58.639]   it's a level of desperation akin to that which we are witnessing right now from the mainstream
[00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:03.757]   corporate media as it dies, as it has become decadent and given up all of its values, its
[00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:04.757]  journalistic integrity.
[00:16:04.757 --> 00:16:06.558]  It has seen its own death.
[00:16:06.558 --> 00:16:11.198]   It is diagnosed with a terminal illness of apathy among all listeners and members of
[00:16:11.198 --> 00:16:15.918]   the audience who don't tune in to these mainstream media networks anymore, who don't read these
[00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:19.677]   mainstream articles anymore because they're boring and they're lies.
[00:16:19.677 --> 00:16:23.879]   I mean, the only reason anybody actually reads the news, there's two reasons that anyone
[00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:27.538]   actually reads mainstream news or views mainstream television.
[00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:33.178]   One reason is that they're brainwashed, and so they just eat it up as fuel for their psychological
[00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:35.178]  mental illness.
[00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:45.119]  Similar to how the transgender people insist that you use their pronouns, these people want to insist that reality, that lies reaffirm their false reality.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:55.609]  So they just love consuming this news that lies to them and just pivots and gives them all the talking points they need to be comfortable on their preconceived notions about the nature of the universe and our political climate today.
[00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.892]  So one reason is to sustain your brainwashing.
[00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:05.453]  And the other reason is so you can be aware of what the deep state is trying to say to you or what the deep state wants you to believe.
[00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:15.157]  I mean, I've got a lot of articles on the desk right now that are analyzing mainstream media articles or mainstream media networks and what they've said and what they're reporting.
[00:17:15.397 --> 00:17:33.110]   Not because we're trying to stay brainwashed by the mainstream media or not because we endorse or condone the reporting from these outlets, but because we are trying to analyze what the globalists, what the deep state, He wants us to believe, or is trying to gaslight us into believing, or is trying to manipulate us into believing.
[00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:50.719]  And so, while Europe goes up there under its new European Union, which might as well be Eurasia from 1984, it makes a mockery, not only of Christianity, by mimicking the Last Supper, and they'll tell you that it's not the Last Supper, they'll tell you that it's some other painting.
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:51.459]  Guys, will you look it up?
[00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:52.900]  It's something, something feast.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.321]  Feast of the gods, or something like that.
[00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:57.262]  I think is the name of the painting they're saying.
[00:17:58.647 --> 00:18:00.152]  I don't know if it's Dionysus or not.
[00:18:00.172 --> 00:18:03.201]  I don't think so, because I don't think Dionysus had goat legs like he did in this painting.
[00:18:03.221 --> 00:18:05.166]  I think it's called Feast of the Gods.
[00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:13.498]  If you Google it, and it was painted 15 years or so, I think 15 to 18 years after The Last Supper, so I think it was inspired by The Last Supper.
[00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:28.852]  But not only are they making fun of our monotheistic, Christian, Western culture values and making a mockery of it by taking all that which is immoral and then implanting it on the medium that is our culture's art.
[00:18:29.963 --> 00:18:35.071]  But they've made a mockery of the Renaissance itself because it's not just about going after God.
[00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:39.998]  It's not just about mocking Jesus Christ or going after faith.
[00:18:40.317 --> 00:18:50.076]   It's about going after Western culture itself, reason itself, which is why they have to attack
[00:18:50.076 --> 00:18:52.978]  the Renaissance, these enlightenment values.
[00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:58.156]   It was the rebirth of civilization after the Dark Ages, after the Middle Ages, after bubonic
[00:18:58.156 --> 00:19:03.676]   plague, after bubonic plague, slaughter after slaughter, crusade after crusade, and tyranny
[00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:07.537]  by Catholicism after tyranny by Catholicism.
[00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:14.317]   Not to mention the tyranny of the Moors as well, who rightfully were driven out of Spain.
[00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:20.896]   But it was a rebirth of freedom of speech, of freedom of thought, of science as it was
[00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:23.478]  meant to be, not this cult that it has become.
[00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:26.370]  And astounding discoveries were made!
[00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.491]  Inventions!
[00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:34.476]  I mean, think of the Benjamin Franklin's, and the Leonardo da Vinci's, and the Sir Isaac Newton's, and the Michelangelo's, and the Raphael's, and the Donatello's!
[00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:40.680]  And it goes into the 18th century, and even into the 19th century some with the Rachmaninoff's!
[00:19:42.041 --> 00:19:42.942]  The Tolstoy's!
[00:19:46.195 --> 00:19:57.644]  And they hate that which is brilliant, that which celebrates the individual, that which holds humankind in high esteem, but not as high esteem as God.
[00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:59.566]  It's not this Tower of Babel thing.
[00:19:59.606 --> 00:20:03.109]  It's not this arrogance thing that the left has where they see themselves as gods.
[00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:07.052]  It's the celebration of humanity in appreciation of God.
[00:20:07.092 --> 00:20:09.194]  Like, wow, it is so amazing.
[00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:13.096]  That God made people who are capable of accomplishing this.
[00:20:13.156 --> 00:20:21.639]  God is so good for this creation, we human beings, and what we are capable of doing if we set our hearts to something good and true and right and just.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:29.403]  So they simultaneously come out and they berate Christianity and all of its values, but they berate Western culture too.
[00:20:30.623 --> 00:20:31.404]  And the Renaissance.
[00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:32.404]  And Enlightenment.
[00:20:32.424 --> 00:20:35.866]  Because Enlightenment, after all, was all about being able to think for oneself.
[00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:50.079]  It was all about freedom of speech, freedom of thought, the very values that are embedded in our Declaration of Independence, the very rights that are protected by the Constitution of the United States of America, namely the Bill of Rights.
[00:20:52.601 --> 00:21:06.708]  They want to erode all of that, tear it all down as much as possible, so that they can pick up the pieces and rebuild some New World Order.
[00:21:08.652 --> 00:21:13.796]  That instead of looking like... The Sistine Chapel will look like a Picasso.
[00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:19.601]  Or distorted Mr. Potato Head.
[00:21:22.143 --> 00:21:23.083]  In all of its ugliness.
[00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:29.008]  And one of the ways they do that is... Migration.
[00:21:30.209 --> 00:21:31.870]  They open up the borders of all these countries.
[00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:32.871]  It happened in Europe.
[00:21:33.111 --> 00:21:35.013]  The European Union is the test case for this.
[00:21:36.673 --> 00:21:37.414]  Sarah, we're going to get together.
[00:21:37.434 --> 00:21:49.709]  We're going to have these international policies where every country that's a member of the European Union is going to agree to accept a minimum quota of refugees and migrants, namely from Africa or Middle Eastern countries, which are war torn for reasons.
[00:21:52.012 --> 00:22:04.215]   And what this is going to do is it's going to dilute The quality of our culture, weakening it, dividing people against each other, raising strife, raising demand for government programs, and then that's when we can go in and enact policies to seize total control.
[00:22:04.235 --> 00:22:13.540]  I mean, have you ever tried to give a three-year-old a glass of orange juice that you fill halfway up with water because you're running low and you don't want to go to the grocery store?
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.180]  Have you ever seen the look on their face?
[00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:17.482]  That's exactly what they're doing to the American culture.
[00:22:17.742 --> 00:22:20.183]  It's exactly what they're doing to the culture in Europe.
[00:22:20.987 --> 00:22:24.050]  Which was the culture behind the Renaissance, by the way.
[00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.194]  They've watered it down with these shitty migrants.
[00:22:29.235 --> 00:22:36.681]  And it's not a racist thing, I mean, these are people that are, they're bad people, they're low IQ, they're uneducated, and they refuse to assimilate.
[00:22:36.842 --> 00:22:39.584]  They're just invading to exploit, like the Vikings.
[00:22:40.885 --> 00:22:43.608]  At least the Vikings had some shred of dignity.
[00:22:48.373 --> 00:22:49.673]  But they're trying to water it all down.
[00:22:49.773 --> 00:23:05.678]  And at the same time that this is happening, we have a vice presidential candidate who is at least misleading, excuse me, presidential candidate who's the current vice president, who is at least misleading the American people about the nature of her racial background for the sake of exploiting that for political purposes.
[00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:09.019]  Keep in mind, she's just as much Indian as she is black.
[00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:12.760]  I believe that her father was Jamaican and that her mother was Indian.
[00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:15.061]  So she's half black.
[00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:16.601]  She's not African American at all.
[00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:17.982]  It's from Jamaica.
[00:23:19.892 --> 00:23:28.557]  But now she's coming out and telling us that we have to have the courage to stand up against terms like radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:23:29.618 --> 00:23:37.065]   We have to have the courage to stand up against things like The term illegal alien.
[00:23:37.465 --> 00:23:47.889]  And why is it that radical, extremist, Islamic terrorism came up just before, juxtaposed, and in the context of illegal immigration?
[00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:50.770]  Well, it's because the illegal immigration is how you get the terrorists in the country.
[00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.332]  But we have to have the courage to stand up against such hateful rhetoric.
[00:23:55.512 --> 00:24:02.075]  Let's run this clip, 56, Kamala Harris talking about the courage to object to radical Islam.
[00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:12.382]   have the courage to object when they use that term, radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:24:12.382 --> 00:24:19.802]   Which is more and more overdominated than the greatest victims of terror.
[00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:26.083]   [APPLAUSE] But you know what she's gonna do, right?
[00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:29.682]   First thing she does if she's president of the United States of America,
[00:24:29.682 --> 00:24:36.682]   is she's gonna provide an expedient path to citizenship for everyone who is here illegally and everyone who comes in in
[00:24:36.682 --> 00:24:37.123]  the future.
[00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:45.734]  And it's just going to ramp up and accelerate the invasion of our country by people from God knows where doing God knows what to American people.
[00:24:46.996 --> 00:24:47.576]  To each other!
[00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:54.909]  And they're running away from these places that are worse than America all while our own leftist leaders tell us that America and Western culture is so bad.
[00:24:55.269 --> 00:25:03.131]  All while the Olympics and their globalist elite class make so-called art that just degenerates Christianity and Western culture itself.
[00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:06.232]  Why is it that everybody wants to come here if it sucks so bad?
[00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:10.914]  Why is it that nobody leaves if everywhere else is supposedly better?
[00:25:11.294 --> 00:25:18.428]   And why is it so offensive to call somewhere else a shithole country If it's not a shithole country, then why is anybody living there in the first place?
[00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:21.569]  And it's fine if people want to come to America.
[00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:22.889]  That's not the issue.
[00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:25.150]  The issue is that when they come, they're not assimilating.
[00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.791]  It used to be that when people immigrated to the United States of America, they learned the damn language.
[00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:31.551]  They got a job or started a business.
[00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:35.092]  They sent their kids to school and they adopted American values.
[00:25:35.112 --> 00:25:36.613]  They practiced whatever religion they wanted.
[00:25:36.793 --> 00:25:40.154]  They maintained some of their traditions, namely cuisine and maybe a Yule log.
[00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:44.035]  But other than that, they were Americans and they voted.
[00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:51.775]  In our elections, for American leaders, and they fought in our wars for American interests, but no more.
[00:25:51.795 --> 00:26:06.643]  Now they're just invading us, all while Senator Elizabeth Warren in Clip 55 reaffirms that Kamala Harris is going to allow the invaders to just become citizens, something akin to late-stage Rome.
[00:26:08.363 --> 00:26:16.531]  ...resources in the states and cities that are supporting migrants, and I believe we need to create a pathway to citizenship.
[00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:21.956]  All of that is part of what we need to do for comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:26:22.396 --> 00:26:25.660]  Kamala Harris will work with Congress and get that done.
[00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:27.962]  So, there you have it.
[00:26:28.803 --> 00:26:31.405]  Even their own parties are admitting that they're just going to grant the invaders citizenship.
[00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:41.664]   Can you imagine if Volodymyr Zelensky came out and said that he was just going to grant all of the Russian invaders Ukrainian citizenship.
[00:26:43.444 --> 00:26:49.267]  I mean, frankly, the United States of America has been invaded by more people in the last three years than Ukraine, right?
[00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:50.147]  You realize that?
[00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:55.590]  You realize that we've experienced a nonviolent, mostly peaceful invasion?
[00:26:57.025 --> 00:27:01.689]  Yeah, we're sending $63 billion to Ukraine on Hitler's birthday, and we're doing absolutely nothing for the border.
[00:27:01.709 --> 00:27:06.893]  We're going to get more into Kamala Harris' history as the borders are on the other side.

[00:27:28.306 --> 00:27:32.306]   It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.

[00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:43.894]  You need to go to InfoWarsTore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWarsMD.

[00:28:02.426 --> 00:28:13.793]  Prioritize the needs of these millions of non-citizens over the needs of the American citizen, with free flights, buses, hotels, meals, and phones, ensuring their loyalty to the political party that imported them.
[00:28:13.813 --> 00:28:13.793]  3.
[00:28:13.993 --> 00:28:22.918]   Keep them in the country at all costs, even when they commit violent crime like murder, 4.
[00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:22.918]  Ensure their privileges are made irrevocable with city and state sanctuary laws that act as population magnets.
[00:28:22.938 --> 00:28:22.918]  5.
[00:28:23.219 --> 00:28:25.219]  Slander critics as racist.
[00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:31.129]   Four, ensure their privileges are made irrevocable with city and state sanctuary laws that act as population
[00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:31.557]  magnets.
[00:28:31.557 --> 00:28:35.179]  Codify permanent status and ensure non-cooperation with ICE.
[00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:40.938]   Five, count the non-citizens in the census that will determine congressional apportionment in the House of
[00:28:40.938 --> 00:28:41.019]  Representatives.
[00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:48.139]   As of now, that would equal 13 extra congressional districts, a tremendous amount of electoral power.
[00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:48.291]  6.
[00:28:49.031 --> 00:29:00.997]  Wage a massive, heavily funded lawfare campaign to change state voting laws that legalize mass mail-in ballots, no signature verification, and no proof of citizenship requirements, making it nearly impossible to prove voter fraud.
[00:29:01.017 --> 00:29:00.997]  7.
[00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:10.442]  Lock in the permanent voting majority with campaign promises of lavish benefits and permanent privileges, enshrining generational fealty to the Democrat Party. 8.
[00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:34.840]  You know, it's crazy when you watch clips like that because not only are they cool and stylish and neat in their dystopian perspective of the world, it's almost like something you would see in The Matrix or something like that.
[00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:39.004]  But it's fascinating to watch videos like that because it turns out it's all true.
[00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:50.212]  It turns out movies like Children of Men or The Matrix or 1984 or books like Brave New World all seem to be coming to pass at least in major substantial ways.
[00:29:51.673 --> 00:29:55.856]  And we're getting into this in the last segment about how the Olympics is like a metaphor or symbol.
[00:29:55.896 --> 00:29:57.537]  It's just another avenue for globalism.
[00:29:57.577 --> 00:30:05.283]  The whole thing is propping up globalism as a concept or a philosophy while simultaneously eroding the notions of national sovereignty.
[00:30:06.533 --> 00:30:17.619]  Debasing our religious freedom, insulting Christianity, and annihilating the concept of the Renaissance.
[00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:28.866]  I mean, the party, the philosophy, the power structure behind the mass genocide that is abortion would hate anything like a rebirth!
[00:30:28.886 --> 00:30:30.727]  They don't even want you born the first time!
[00:30:34.062 --> 00:31:03.248]  And now we know that part of this strategy, a key part of the globalist strategy, is to water down Western culture by opening up borders, weaken the economic systems, make everyone confused, brainwashed, disoriented, and poor, and desperate, vulnerable, independent, and then pit them against each other, and then come in with the overarching boot, the overarching grip of the iron state, and conglomerate all political power to subjugate humanity forever.
[00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.611]  It sounds like a sci-fi movie.
[00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:09.234]  It sounds like something that might be ridiculous, and I would have thought it was ridiculous, too.
[00:31:09.254 --> 00:31:22.425]  I did think it was ridiculous until I started looking into all these details and following people like Ian Carroll and Alex Jones and listening to podcasts like Joe Rogan instead of watching the History Channel.
[00:31:22.445 --> 00:31:25.887]  And don't get me wrong, the History Channel's got plenty of great content, but it's got a lot of BS, too.
[00:31:25.907 --> 00:31:28.450]  Because it's just a corporate network.
[00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.393]  It's totally influenced and saturated by the Deep State in one way or the other.
[00:31:33.513 --> 00:31:38.478]  And when you start thinking for yourselves, you start coming to your own conclusions.
[00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:40.600]  And sometimes those conclusions are correct.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.105]  In fact, more times than not, if you're a rational human being, regardless of how intelligent you are, those conclusions are correct.
[00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:52.230]  And you start seeing through the lies, which is exactly why they want to censor us here at InfoWars.
[00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:58.096]  They want to censor you, and they want to silence, control all speech, all narratives the world over.
[00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:06.734]  Because darkness cannot exist in the presence of even the tiniest light.
[00:32:07.234 --> 00:32:09.596]  Of even the smallest light.
[00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:13.039]  It's like that scene from The Lord of the Rings.
[00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:13.439]  What was it?
[00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:14.920]  The beginning of The Return of the King?
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.143]  Or was it the end of The Two Towers?
[00:32:18.163 --> 00:32:20.245]  Where Frodo's got the light in the jar.
[00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:21.265]  I've talked about it before on air.
[00:32:21.486 --> 00:32:22.286]  You guys always remind me.
[00:32:22.326 --> 00:32:24.828]  Derek, will you remind me what the name of that light was?
[00:32:26.169 --> 00:32:27.651]  The Vial of Galadriel.
[00:32:28.692 --> 00:32:29.032]  File?
[00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:32.684]  P-H-I-A-L.
[00:32:32.925 --> 00:32:34.628]  The file of Galadriel.
[00:32:36.184 --> 00:32:50.286]  And when he was in the darkest moment, and it's all metaphor for, like, if you're in combat, if you're going through some terrible thing, and you're in this just own personal hell, and there seems to be no escape whatsoever, and there's this, like, mysterious beast, and you've been betrayed by everyone.
[00:32:50.306 --> 00:32:54.067]  You've abandoned your friends, or they've abandoned you, and you thought you could trust who led you into the cave.
[00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.107]  It's all a metaphor.
[00:32:55.127 --> 00:32:56.507]  That's what's so beautiful about Tolkien.
[00:32:56.527 --> 00:33:04.009]  That's what's so amazing about it, is it's not some dorky fantasy novel for kids who want to go to the park and dress up like medieval knights and, you know, pretend to cast spells.
[00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:04.449]  It's not that.
[00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:07.191]   It is The human condition embodied.
[00:33:07.211 --> 00:33:10.794]  It's just a type of art that globalists love making fun of at the Olympics.
[00:33:10.814 --> 00:33:19.902]  But when you're in this moment of darkness, if you have the phial of Galadriel, just that small light within, no darkness can exist in the presence of the smallest light.
[00:33:19.923 --> 00:33:21.264]  I mean, look at the stars, for example.
[00:33:21.744 --> 00:33:23.005]  The vastness of our universe.
[00:33:24.212 --> 00:33:30.938]  The infinite size of outer space and you can still see a star millions upon millions of light years away.
[00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:32.419]  And that's just in one galaxy.
[00:33:32.439 --> 00:33:41.286]  It's a small little light that defies the vastness of the all-encompassing darkness that is the nothingness of outer space.
[00:33:41.546 --> 00:33:44.749]  It is a symbol for truth amidst lies.
[00:33:45.529 --> 00:34:00.329]   We are surrounded, saturated, engulfed by lies from everyone from our brainwashed neighbors To our brainwashed family members, all the way up to the highest levels of our governments and institutions.
[00:34:00.369 --> 00:34:02.451]  Our political leaders are even brainwashed, some of them.
[00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:09.096]  Most of them are just lying after a certain point you realize the game that you're in and you just keep playing and keep perpetuating this corruption that you're in.
[00:34:11.137 --> 00:34:17.222]  But amidst those lies, a small leak is enough to sink the great ship that is the dishonesty of the narrative.
[00:34:17.262 --> 00:34:27.201]   A small leak, a small amount of truth can just eliminate and eradicate all of the darkness from these lies, which is why it's more important now than
[00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:32.401]   ever that you go to Infowarsstore.com or that you go to drjonesnaturals.com
[00:34:32.401 --> 00:34:37.519]   that's drjonesnaturals.com and be the reason that places like
[00:34:37.519 --> 00:34:46.481]   Infowars exist because folks there's only let's not exaggerate it be
[00:34:44.587 --> 00:34:50.309]  A number of years ago, I would say there were only like three or four places where you could get real reporting, real truth.
[00:34:51.109 --> 00:35:09.175]  Now, because of this new renaissance, this great awakening that we're experiencing, the birth of podcasting and things like Russell Brand converting to Christianity and Sean Ryan and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson getting away from the corporate trap that was Fox News and starting his own podcast, now number one on Spotify.
[00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:14.728]  There's probably maybe a dozen to two dozen max.
[00:35:14.828 --> 00:35:33.154]  I would say between 12 and 18 places where you can consistently go for reliable truth from honest people who are actually dedicating and committing their lives to discovering the truth, reporting, analyzing, and sharing that truth on all social media, on all broadcasts.
[00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:35.575]  And that is a scary few.
[00:35:36.716 --> 00:35:39.337]  It's like the Justice League of truth.
[00:35:41.144 --> 00:35:48.026]  And that's why it's so important that you go to InfoWarsStore.com because we cannot do this without your support.
[00:35:48.406 --> 00:35:57.549]  We cannot be on the air, out of prison, fighting against the New World Order, both within and without our nation's borders, unless you go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:36:07.313 --> 00:36:08.494]  My mother-in-law is a nutritionist.
[00:36:08.854 --> 00:36:11.836]  She's read the back of the labels of all the products that I have laying around the house.
[00:36:11.856 --> 00:36:12.556]  She's impressed.
[00:36:13.477 --> 00:36:13.957]  Trust her.
[00:36:14.298 --> 00:36:15.098]  She's a smart lady.

[00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:30.786]   This is top of the line stuff with key partners that we've had for years,
[00:36:30.786 --> 00:36:36.105]   formulas of our supplements that have been developed by top scientists and industry leading experts.
[00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:39.224]   We can't even name some of the names 'cause some people are helping us anonymously,
[00:36:39.224 --> 00:36:42.005]   some of these manufacturers, because they wanna keep us on the air.
[00:36:42.005 --> 00:36:47.025]   They wanna help be a part of our success without jeopardizing their ability to do business
[00:36:47.025 --> 00:36:48.246]  with others at the same time.
[00:36:48.246 --> 00:36:51.505]   Please go to infowarsstore.com if you haven't, if you've been thinking about it.
[00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:56.385]   I know times are tough, people are strapped, inflation is terrible, but this is not an expense, folks.
[00:36:56.385 --> 00:37:01.605]   This is an investment in your health and health is the foundation to liberty
[00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:04.945]   because what is liberty without life and what is life without health?
[00:37:04.837 --> 00:37:09.078]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and be the reason we're still on the air.
[00:37:09.138 --> 00:37:11.419]  But let's get back to the news because I know that's why you're here.
[00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:16.921]  And now it's my turn, since I've asked for something from you, to give back.
[00:37:20.134 --> 00:37:44.522]  To bring back up this erosion of our culture, its intentionality, how it happened in Europe through the European Union, how it's happening in the United States through our wide-open border in the South, our wide-open border in the North, and that's all in the context of Kamala Harris saying we have to have the courage to stand up against phrases like radical Islamic terrorism, or against phrases like illegal alien, because humans aren't illegal!
[00:37:44.542 --> 00:37:48.243]  Except for the ones that you want to murder before they're born.
[00:37:49.653 --> 00:37:56.955]  But here she is in clip number 29 talking about an immigration bill reinstating DACA and dealing with the Muslim ban.
[00:37:57.955 --> 00:38:01.456]  These last four years have been heartbreaking and difficult ones.
[00:38:01.936 --> 00:38:03.916]  Children have been separated from their families.
[00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:09.958]  Those fleeing persecution have been denied the ability to even apply for refuge.
[00:38:10.738 --> 00:38:17.780]  And immigrants, even immigrants who came here legally and have been here a long time, have been subjected to attack and abuse.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:28.374]  President-elect Biden and I will work to right the wrongs of these past four years and honor and advance America's heritage as a nation of immigrants.
[00:38:28.715 --> 00:38:34.023]  We know that immigrants have always made our country stronger and that's what they are doing today.
[00:38:34.804 --> 00:38:49.140]  As we have grappled with the coronavirus pandemic, immigrants are on the front lines helping to keep us safe and helping to keep our economy going as healthcare professionals, caregivers, grocers, and farm workers.
[00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:54.584]  And together, we will build a better, more humane immigration system.
[00:38:55.084 --> 00:39:04.490]  In our first 100 days, we will send an immigration bill to Congress, reinstate DACA, repeal harmful and discriminatory policies like the Muslim ban.
[00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:13.436]  And during our administration, we will repeal indiscriminate enforcement policies that tear families apart and make us less safe.
[00:39:14.397 --> 00:39:18.720]  So thank you again for all the work you have done and continue to do.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.401]  That work is not easy, I know.
[00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:26.383]  But I know also that we can deliver the change we need.
[00:39:27.063 --> 00:39:41.489]  And President-elect Biden and I are looking forward to working alongside you in the weeks, the months, and the years ahead to usher in not only a better immigration system, but a more just and equitable America.
[00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.031]  Okay, here's what she sounds like without a teleprompter.
[00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:44.771]  Clip number three.
[00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:53.656]  And talking about the significance of the passage of time, right?
[00:39:53.716 --> 00:39:55.858]  The significance of the passage of time.
[00:39:55.878 --> 00:39:56.899]  Say it again if you don't know what it means.
[00:39:56.919 --> 00:40:06.608]  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires, what we need to do to create these jobs.
[00:40:07.048 --> 00:40:14.455]  And there is such great significance to the passage of time when we think about a day in the life of our children.
[00:40:16.144 --> 00:40:25.658]  And what that means to the future of our nation, depending on whether or not they have the resources they need to achieve their God-given talent.
[00:40:25.978 --> 00:40:30.825]  These leftists too, they love to replace words or change the definitions of words.
[00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:32.107]  They've done that with democracy.
[00:40:33.203 --> 00:40:36.425]  Where they use it, and they've even convinced Republicans to use the word democracy.
[00:40:36.445 --> 00:40:40.347]  I love Donald Trump, and it was awesome when he used the line that took a bullet for democracy.
[00:40:40.387 --> 00:40:44.809]  I just wish he would have said, I took a bullet for republicanism, or a republic, or for America.
[00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.711]  Because democracy sucks, it's the number one cause of tyranny.
[00:40:49.292 --> 00:40:53.634]  I don't think that a single democracy has ever lasted more than 300 years without becoming a tyranny.
[00:40:54.614 --> 00:40:57.196]  Republics have, and constitutional republics, and representative republics.
[00:40:57.216 --> 00:41:01.298]  Our republic has democratic processes, but it's not a democracy that's BS.
[00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:11.336]  So just as they changed the words, like anti-Semitism and what that means, I mean, anybody who's against Israel's actions at all now is an anti-Semite, even if they have no problems with Jewish people.
[00:41:12.177 --> 00:41:17.635]   Anybody who is against Kamala Harris is a racist or a xenophobe now
[00:41:17.635 --> 00:41:41.734]   Or a misogynist And they hijack these words, they steal them, they abuse the language just like 1984 to gaslight and manipulate and brainwash the population, and now they're doing it, they have been doing it for several years, with this notion of equity because equality suddenly isn't good enough anymore.
[00:41:42.475 --> 00:41:46.619]  Equality didn't really get them where they wanted to be as a one-party state, did it?
[00:41:48.814 --> 00:41:51.237]  1964 Civil Rights Act passes and all of a sudden we have equality.
[00:41:51.317 --> 00:41:52.578]  Our kids are going to the same schools.
[00:41:52.618 --> 00:41:54.600]  We all use the same water fountain now.
[00:41:55.061 --> 00:41:56.162]  Equality, equal rights.
[00:41:56.202 --> 00:42:00.807]  There's not a single right that men have that women don't also have in the United States of America now that they can vote.
[00:42:02.169 --> 00:42:03.170]  Because of the 19th Amendment.
[00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:20.443]  Now that we've accomplished equality and discovered that it has not eradicated all of the injustices that our culture faces, that it has not eradicated poverty, it has not solved the disparity in the wealthiest among us and the poorest among us.
[00:42:20.483 --> 00:42:22.824]  In fact, that's expanding rapidly because of inflation.
[00:42:24.084 --> 00:42:27.485]  Now that equality just isn't cutting it, maybe we should go for something else.
[00:42:27.505 --> 00:42:28.425]  How about equity?
[00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.126]  It even sounds like equality.
[00:42:31.243 --> 00:42:38.085]  But the difference is equality is equal treatment under the law, equal opportunity, fairness by the system.
[00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:45.607]  The system is blind to you and your immutable characteristics and just handles each situation with this perfect justice.
[00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:50.008]  That's what equality is supposed to be, but equity is equality of outcome.
[00:42:51.649 --> 00:42:55.310]  It's a participation ribbon, but in every aspect of your life.
[00:42:56.055 --> 00:43:07.097]  So no matter how hard you work, or how successful you are, or how much value you bring, same outcome, you have the same car, you have the same phone, you have the same internet speeds, you have the same house, you have the same everything, your wife's just as hot.
[00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:10.012]  Everything is the same.
[00:43:10.452 --> 00:43:11.773]  Nobody's better than anybody else.
[00:43:12.093 --> 00:43:29.145]  It takes equality and just applies it to the back end and they trick you and they lie to you and they deceive you to try to make you believe that equity is going to make everybody the same amount of rich when really what it is is making everyone equally poor.
[00:43:30.906 --> 00:43:37.692]   So instead of having Unequal levels of prosperity in the country.
[00:43:38.332 --> 00:43:44.735]  Everybody's wealthy, but just to different degrees, which is basically what the United States accomplished for the first time of any civilization in the history of humankind.
[00:43:47.497 --> 00:43:51.499]  I mean, our poverty line is like higher than the average income of how many nations?
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:59.263]  We accomplished a civilization where our homeless people are fat.
[00:44:00.183 --> 00:44:01.324]  That's how rich we got.
[00:44:02.472 --> 00:44:06.255]  With equality and capitalism and basically no government interference.
[00:44:08.276 --> 00:44:13.220]  But now with equity, instead of being unequally prosperous, they want to make everybody equally poor.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.101]  It's like breadline stuff.
[00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:18.764]  And here's Kamala Harris going off on the difference between equality and equity in clip number 30.
[00:44:18.864 --> 00:44:22.266]  So there's a big difference between equality and equity.
[00:44:22.306 --> 00:44:23.007]  Hell yeah, there is.
[00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:25.489]  Equality suggests genocide versus not.
[00:44:27.682 --> 00:44:28.482]  There's a problem with that.
[00:44:29.102 --> 00:44:30.763]  Not everybody's starting out from the same place.
[00:44:31.483 --> 00:44:39.005]  So if we're all getting the same amount, but you started out back there and I started out over here, we could get the same amount, but you're still going to be that far back behind me.
[00:44:39.045 --> 00:44:41.386]  You're still going to be that far back behind me?
[00:44:41.486 --> 00:44:45.507]  It's about giving people the resources and the support they need.
[00:44:45.527 --> 00:44:48.407]  I love how her vernacular changes depending on who she's talking to.
[00:44:48.487 --> 00:44:51.308]  On equal footing and then compete on equal footing.
[00:44:52.368 --> 00:44:52.688]  Equitably.
[00:44:52.508 --> 00:44:53.748]  Weed out here in these streets.
[00:44:53.748 --> 00:44:54.748]  You remember that last week?
[00:44:54.748 --> 00:44:55.748]  We all end up at the same place.
[00:44:55.748 --> 00:45:08.148]   Yeah, so instead of all of us having equal rights, we're going to have
[00:45:08.148 --> 00:45:10.748]  equal tyranny.
[00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:11.837]  The boot.
[00:45:11.977 --> 00:45:14.801]  And she says gun control is going to be implemented with executive order.
[00:45:14.841 --> 00:45:15.122]  Can it be?
[00:45:15.142 --> 00:45:15.723]  That's what she thinks.
[00:45:15.543 --> 00:45:26.061]  Thanks, this is clip 28.
[00:45:26.046 --> 00:45:26.386]  That's right.
[00:45:26.526 --> 00:45:31.128]  President Obama after Sandy Hook more than 23 executive actions and yet here we all are today.
[00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:38.190]  In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[00:45:38.551 --> 00:45:40.151]  They said I'm going to issue an executive order.
[00:45:40.211 --> 00:45:46.114]  Biden saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[00:45:46.174 --> 00:45:56.277]   Saying you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive Well, I mean, I would just say, hey Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say yes we can.
[00:45:56.297 --> 00:45:56.937]  Let's be constitutional.
[00:45:56.957 --> 00:45:57.657]  We've got a constitution.
[00:45:57.517 --> 00:46:04.557]   answers. I mean I would just say hey Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say yes we can.
[00:46:04.557 --> 00:46:14.716]   Okay so executive order to violate your second amendment right to self-defense.
[00:46:14.716 --> 00:46:19.757]   And remind me again of all the atrocities that have been committed to human beings,
[00:46:19.757 --> 00:46:26.716]   of all the tragedies that civilization has faced on a massive scale, what percentage of them other
[00:46:26.716 --> 00:46:33.757]   than the bubonic plague and maybe a tsunami or a volcano, what percentage of them have been
[00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:35.437]  perpetuated by governments again?
[00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:36.297]  Can you remind me?
[00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.312]  Holocaust government, Baltimore government, okay, alright, alright.
[00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:45.115]  Communism, yeah, yeah, Great Leap Forward government, okay, 9-11, inside job government, okay.
[00:46:45.456 --> 00:47:02.427]  Every single tragedy, seemingly, that has befallen mankind has come from the government, and it's been violent and forced, and there have been arrests, and people disappear in the middle of the night, and there's Gestapos having Kristallnacht and just terrorizing communities.
[00:47:04.195 --> 00:47:07.761]  Communists, I mean, God, the things that they've done, the things they still do in the CCP.
[00:47:09.164 --> 00:47:11.027]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:47:11.488 --> 00:47:33.353]   And so when they talk about coming after your guns because they care so much about your safety, It's just BS because we know that whether it's the government of the United States of America or any other government in the history of human beings altogether, present, past, and future, there is no conscience among an organization or within organizations that large.
[00:47:33.853 --> 00:47:44.935]  Everything's too disjointed, too decentralized, too disconnected for any one person within these organizations, these governments, to feel culpable or accountable for the travesties committed by that organization.
[00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:48.076]  Nobody at Enron feels responsible for what Enron did.
[00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:54.780]  Nobody at Google feels responsible for what Google does or what Facebook or a Twitter before was X or others.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.562]  They all just say, Oh yeah, that department's crazy.
[00:47:57.582 --> 00:47:58.403]  That department's crazy.
[00:47:58.443 --> 00:47:58.643]  Oh yeah.
[00:47:58.663 --> 00:47:59.663]  Those DEI department.
[00:47:59.683 --> 00:48:00.124]  That's crazy.
[00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:02.665]  Don't, don't, don't piss them off because you can lose your job.
[00:48:03.026 --> 00:48:03.666]  It's not my fault.
[00:48:03.686 --> 00:48:04.266]  It's not my fault.
[00:48:04.306 --> 00:48:05.307]  They pass the buck.
[00:48:05.327 --> 00:48:06.968]  They pass it and they pass it and they pass it and they pass it.
[00:48:06.988 --> 00:48:11.491]  And then finally stops at a King or a tyrant or a despot like Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.
[00:48:12.031 --> 00:48:13.671]   And Boom!
[00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:14.932]  Genocide.
[00:48:15.872 --> 00:48:16.952]  Concentration camps.
[00:48:17.513 --> 00:48:18.433]  Massive arrests.
[00:48:18.773 --> 00:48:19.573]  People disappearing.
[00:48:19.613 --> 00:48:30.918]  And when the Steve Bannons are in prison, when these J6 protesters are in prison for praying inside the Capitol after the doors were opened by the government and we know the protesters were infiltrated by the feds themselves.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:38.206]  When elections are being stolen, we are in the preceding stages of massive genocide.
[00:48:38.226 --> 00:48:39.127]  You realize that, folks?
[00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:48.715]  Genocide committed on the American people by the deep state for the sake of globalization and conglomeration of power so they can subjugate humanity forever.
[00:48:50.317 --> 00:48:51.398]  That's what we're on the cusp of.
[00:48:52.418 --> 00:48:53.279]  Right before our eyes.
[00:48:56.562 --> 00:49:13.652]   And so, Not only do they want to take away your guns, not only do they want to make sure you're totally poor by using equity as a moral virtue while they debase Catholicism or Christianity or the Renaissance itself at the Olympics, but they also want to discourage you from having any children.
[00:49:13.672 --> 00:49:24.634]   And the reason they want to do that is because they understand that if you have children, Your values are more likely to shift in a conservative direction.
[00:49:24.674 --> 00:49:34.458]  Not that you'll become a Republican, per se, or become a conservative, per se, but that suddenly there's something more important to you than the state in your life.
[00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:41.362]  When you have a family, you care more about that kid than any government or any law or any guy knocking at your door saying they have a warrant.
[00:49:42.318 --> 00:49:43.458]  You care more about that kid?
[00:49:43.658 --> 00:49:46.879]  And that feels like adultery to the state.
[00:49:47.279 --> 00:49:48.580]  Hey, we thought you were married to us.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.340]  Why are you cheating on us by having children with some other woman?
[00:49:54.521 --> 00:50:06.404]  And so they want to scare you out of having children, have the population reduced to justify the replacement migration into the country to sabotage the culture, to divide the people, make them more dependent on the government.
[00:50:07.611 --> 00:50:13.553]  And then you give away all of your freedom for the sake of relief.
[00:50:15.094 --> 00:50:18.835]  It's like that scene from the Titanic, the movie, after the passenger was shot.
[00:50:21.296 --> 00:50:21.976]  And he falls down.
[00:50:22.036 --> 00:50:24.077]  He had been a friend of one of the other characters.
[00:50:24.557 --> 00:50:35.201]  And as the ship is sinking, the character is just desperately trying to untie the life vest from his shot friend so he can put on the life vest while the ship sinks in the Titanic.
[00:50:38.817 --> 00:50:47.424]  That's the level of desperation we will get to as a civilization on a massive scale if we allow these leftists into power to take over.
[00:50:48.344 --> 00:50:55.730]  We'll be so hungry, so in need of healthcare, so in need of housing.
[00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:02.335]  I mean, just essential fundamental things that they want us to be desperate for and clinging to and just at their mercy for.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.480]  And then you come in and say, all right, we'll do that.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.401]  We'll give you this and that.
[00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:08.501]  Have a little bit of food.
[00:51:09.161 --> 00:51:11.542]  But you got to tell us when your neighbor says something against the state.
[00:51:12.982 --> 00:51:16.123]  Or you know which way you're going to vote, right?
[00:51:16.643 --> 00:51:19.324]  Because we're going to be looking over your shoulder at the ballot box.
[00:51:20.204 --> 00:51:21.824]  Or why don't you just stay home this year and not vote?
[00:51:22.244 --> 00:51:23.465]  We'll submit a ballot for you.
[00:51:24.745 --> 00:51:26.045]  And then you're done for.
[00:51:27.646 --> 00:51:29.806]  And then that's it.
[00:51:30.186 --> 00:51:30.866]  This is clip number 80.
[00:51:31.006 --> 00:51:31.807]  I want to run it real quick.
[00:51:31.827 --> 00:51:33.087]  I think we have enough time before we go to break.
[00:51:34.793 --> 00:51:36.134]  Yeah, don't have kids, folks.
[00:51:36.154 --> 00:51:37.535]  Planet's gonna burn up.
[00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:38.835]  Might as well just not have them.
[00:51:38.855 --> 00:51:43.858]  Go ahead and die off old in a nursing home provided to you by the government.
[00:51:43.898 --> 00:51:48.537]   of the future and the unknown of whether it makes sense for you to even think about having
[00:51:48.537 --> 00:51:50.057]  children whether it makes sense.
[00:51:50.057 --> 00:51:51.577]  Yeah, don't have kids folks.
[00:51:51.577 --> 00:51:54.177]  Planet's gonna burn up.
[00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.698]  Might as well just not have them.
[00:51:55.698 --> 00:52:00.457]   Go ahead and die off old in a nursing home provided to you by the government.
[00:52:00.457 --> 00:52:02.838]   There's nobody that's gonna love you enough to take care of you when you're the last one
[00:52:02.838 --> 00:52:03.838]  you know alive.
[00:52:03.838 --> 00:52:07.298]   I mean the whole point of having kids is so you're not a burden on anybody else when you're
[00:52:07.963 --> 00:52:09.503]  I mean, it's actually better for everybody.
[00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:09.923]  Stay with us.
[00:52:11.723 --> 00:52:16.864]  This is a make-it-or-break-it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:52:18.045 --> 00:52:21.125]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:52:21.145 --> 00:52:23.966]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:52:24.006 --> 00:52:24.746]  How are you still in the air?
[00:52:24.906 --> 00:52:25.206]  God.
[00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.287]  But God works through people.
[00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:40.277]   So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months, If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:52:40.297 --> 00:52:41.218]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:52:42.138 --> 00:52:42.618]  And that's coming.
[00:52:42.638 --> 00:52:43.358]  That's got to be set up.
[00:52:44.519 --> 00:52:53.722]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:52:53.862 --> 00:53:05.170]   And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, We caught him.
[00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:06.471]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:53:07.972 --> 00:53:09.453]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:10.273 --> 00:53:10.533]  Alright?
[00:53:11.314 --> 00:53:14.075]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:14.556 --> 00:53:15.296]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:15.356 --> 00:53:18.618]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:18.838 --> 00:53:19.879]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:53:19.899 --> 00:53:20.659]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.161]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:24.841]  We need support.
[00:53:25.562 --> 00:53:27.123]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:29.107]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[00:53:29.127 --> 00:53:36.618]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:53:36.658 --> 00:53:37.619]  We want a relationship.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:44.288]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:53:45.034 --> 00:53:52.279]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:56.723]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:53:56.743 --> 00:53:58.064]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:53:58.084 --> 00:54:09.432]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWarsMD.
[00:54:09.853 --> 00:54:11.334]  We've got ashwagandha gummy.

[00:54:16.157 --> 00:54:16.557]  Amazing.

[00:54:22.362 --> 00:54:23.502]  They're all different formulas.
[00:54:23.743 --> 00:54:24.263]  People love it.
[00:54:24.423 --> 00:54:25.204]  Goodnight Sleep.

[00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:36.628]  Joint Relief Max.

[00:54:46.057 --> 00:54:46.717]  Already mentioned that.

[00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:24.151]  I think it's time for us to.
[00:55:24.831 --> 00:55:27.213]  This motherfucker was a plant, Joe Biden.
[00:55:27.453 --> 00:55:28.634]  He was put into power.
[00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:36.319]  Illegally, he was then utilized to be the figurehead that was perceived to be incompetent to destroy our country.
[00:55:36.419 --> 00:55:42.523]  If you look at what he's done and you look at the damage that he's created, this man was put in power to do that damage.
[00:55:42.624 --> 00:55:46.066]  And then for all of us who say, oh, look, he's so dumb.
[00:55:46.106 --> 00:55:47.167]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:55:47.187 --> 00:55:50.229]  There's nothing dumb about what these people are doing.
[00:55:50.269 --> 00:55:51.950]  The dumb motherfucker is Joe Biden.
[00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:54.412]  Have they had a competent leader in there?
[00:55:54.452 --> 00:55:56.593]  Let's say they had a Barack Obama.
[00:55:56.673 --> 00:55:59.395]  They would look at that guy and they would say, dude, that guy's a traitor.
[00:55:59.475 --> 00:56:03.638]  So they needed someone who looked incompetent to do what they've done.
[00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:10.323]  And that's another reason why they're pushing Kamala now, because the job isn't done, which coincidentally is their slogan.
[00:56:10.383 --> 00:56:11.503]  Let's finish the job.
[00:56:12.004 --> 00:56:13.505]  Our economic plan is working.
[00:56:14.145 --> 00:56:16.687]  We now have to finish the job, but there's more to do.
[00:56:17.267 --> 00:56:19.973]   Biden was Stole the election 2020.
[00:56:20.353 --> 00:56:33.005]   We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud Organization in the history of American politics.
[00:56:33.025 --> 00:56:46.408]  We went from an under 50% of the population saying they were concerned about cheating in 2020 to now our biggest number 66% of people are now at least somewhat concerned that cheating will affect the outcome of the 2024 election.
[00:56:46.468 --> 00:57:11.461]   This dude got his freaking work permit and social security card came here illegally got documented Got on the buses from Texas to Chicago and Now, within four months, this guy's got his social security card, he's got his worker's identification card for working, he's got a driver's license, he's got insurance, he just bought a car, all in four months.
[00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:14.242]  And he has an efficiency apartment that he pays $500 a month for.
[00:57:14.702 --> 00:57:18.123]  Pennsylvania was registering non-citizens for 20 years, and they admit it!
[00:57:18.803 --> 00:57:20.184]  This is not subject to debate.
[00:57:20.685 --> 00:57:27.510]  And so then sticking with the topic of non-citizen voting, isn't it true that this November non-citizens that reside in D.C.
[00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.913]  for simply 30 days can vote in D.C.
[00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:31.873]  municipal elections?
[00:57:32.434 --> 00:57:33.074]  That's correct.
[00:57:33.455 --> 00:57:34.275]  And D.C.
[00:57:34.535 --> 00:57:38.118]  also mails every registered voter a ballot, correct?
[00:57:38.258 --> 00:57:38.559]  Correct.
[00:57:39.159 --> 00:57:50.288]  And so, you're telling me that in Washington, D.C., if there is even a small clerical mistake, non-citizens could be mailed a ballot with federal races on them?
[00:57:50.848 --> 00:57:51.649]  That's correct.
[00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:55.012]  We found several other things using open source data.
[00:57:55.893 --> 00:57:58.435]  There is a gentleman named Eric Lutzen.
[00:58:00.316 --> 00:58:02.297]  He has matched up a list.
[00:58:02.337 --> 00:58:12.504]  He started looking at voters above the age of 80 that were registered for voting and did vote in Michigan.
[00:58:14.285 --> 00:58:20.209]  And 17,327 Michigan voters also had a corresponding obituary.
[00:58:20.389 --> 00:58:22.230]  They were on the voter rolls with the birth date of 1850.
[00:58:23.932 --> 00:58:29.856]  Um, there were 232 people registered to vote with an address, um, to our local prisons.
[00:58:29.876 --> 00:58:33.038]  Um, there were 4,144 people that were 90 years old and older.
[00:58:37.805 --> 00:58:48.714]  Um, there were 125 people registered to vote or on the voter rolls, uh, that were registered to, or their address comes back to nonprofit NGOs and different businesses.
[00:58:49.494 --> 00:58:54.238]  Um, there were 300 people, approximately 300 people with no first name, just the last name.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:05.127]  Um, there were about 110 people that were possible double voters, basically the same, uh, name, date of birth, address, but two different voter ID numbers.
[00:59:06.555 --> 00:59:10.316]  People registered to vote at various shelters and all that.
[00:59:11.837 --> 00:59:14.717]  We even found one person on the voter rolls by the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:15.258 --> 00:59:24.360]  And now they're finishing up organizing that, and they will move into high gear with all the things they believe will destabilize things and create enough fear to keep them in power.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:40.029]   So they're going to strengthen the powers of the executive if they get their puppet in, but they're also preparing to strip powers and strip powers from the Supreme Court by packing the court and adding a whole bunch of new members But they control, so they've got all these things pre-programmed, ready.
[00:59:40.049 --> 00:59:47.235]  Yeah, well I think we've got all the Democrats who are ready for meaningful ethics reform to bind the Supreme Court.
[00:59:47.975 --> 00:59:50.917]  And we're working on changes to the Supreme Court.
[00:59:50.938 --> 00:59:54.160]  It can be term limits, it could be adding the number of justices.
[00:59:54.661 --> 00:59:58.263]  Things we can do without having to have a constitutional amendment.
[00:59:58.684 --> 01:00:01.606]  Here is a man who's been a transformative president.
[01:00:01.626 --> 01:00:03.308]  He's gotten an enormous amount done.
[01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:07.451]  And yet he has stepped away and he has passed the torch.
[01:00:08.712 --> 01:00:10.614]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:10.634 --> 01:00:14.597]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next two hours and 54 minutes.
[01:00:14.637 --> 01:00:18.320]  We will be taking your calls at least in the final hour today, maybe even earlier.
[01:00:19.221 --> 01:00:20.682]  But I've got a lot of news to cover still.
[01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:28.108]  As I cover these articles on the desk during the breaks, I take the ones that I covered off and I throw them on the floor over here.
[01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:33.743]  And so you can see on the desk, there's still countless articles to go over.
[01:00:35.843 --> 01:00:37.124]  Countless things to talk about.
[01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:38.424]  I want to talk a little bit about Project 2025.
[01:00:38.544 --> 01:00:44.365]  Now, admittedly, I have not read the 900-page think piece.
[01:00:44.505 --> 01:00:49.966]  I have not even gone so far as to have chat GPT or some other AI analyze it and give me the summation of it.
[01:00:50.006 --> 01:00:51.627]  I probably agree with a lot of what's in it.
[01:00:52.547 --> 01:00:58.008]  If it's right, if it's right-wing extremism, I probably agree with most of it, to be honest with you.
[01:00:59.494 --> 01:01:07.797]  By what the left has redefined as right-wing extremism, which is just traditional conservative values and common-sense America-first policies, I'm absolutely a right-wing extremist.
[01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:14.720]  If believing in traditional American values and America-first policies is terrorism, then I am a domestic terrorist.
[01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:16.941]  Because I believe in those things.
[01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:24.324]  No matter what name you call me, no matter what you try to brand me, no matter what kind of looks you give me when I walk into the gas station in a MAGA hat, I'm sorry, I'm just a terrorist.
[01:01:24.344 --> 01:01:25.245]  I'm just an extremist.
[01:01:25.425 --> 01:01:25.985]  You want a duel?
[01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:30.105]  Because obviously debate doesn't work anymore with these people.
[01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:31.646]  They're so brainwashed.
[01:01:31.666 --> 01:01:32.487]  I'm bringing into this too.
[01:01:33.567 --> 01:01:43.032]  But great piece that was posted on Infowars.com by Jonathan Newman about what Project 2025 says about the Fed.
[01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:48.935]  We've heard the left come out incessantly bashing Project 2025.
[01:01:50.831 --> 01:01:55.593]  They tried bashing Trump, and every time they do that, it's backfired on them so much that they're pivoting.
[01:01:55.913 --> 01:02:14.313]   And remember, all the leftist accounts that were paid for by the Biden campaign specifically, the Harry Sissons and others, Who literally just regurgitate Biden campaign talking points when the campaign changed form to the Kamala campaign.
[01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:17.173]  All those same influencers just went over and shifted.
[01:02:17.213 --> 01:02:20.774]  I mean, the campaign headquarters changed the sign up outside of the front in Delaware.
[01:02:21.214 --> 01:02:24.815]  And all of a sudden, instead of being the Biden campaign headquarters, it was the Kamala campaign headquarters.
[01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:26.955]  And then all the influencers followed suit immediately.
[01:02:28.596 --> 01:02:29.376]  It just converted.
[01:02:29.476 --> 01:02:32.917]  Kind of like how Rome didn't really fall.
[01:02:32.977 --> 01:02:34.537]  It just became the Roman Catholic Church.
[01:02:35.726 --> 01:02:41.088]  Still conquered the world, still present all over the world, still has its own country, basically, at the Vatican.
[01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:47.791]  More land and money than I think any other organization, except for maybe the crown in England.
[01:02:47.811 --> 01:02:49.952]  I've never crunched the numbers.
[01:02:52.533 --> 01:03:00.296]  But what one of the talking points was after this debate that happened on June 27th, where Joe Biden proved to the world that he lost his mind.
[01:03:01.383 --> 01:03:04.384]  And I'm not being hyperbolic here, that's exactly what happened.
[01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:12.207]  The world could no longer exist in denial that Joe Biden was in severe cognitive decline.
[01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:20.549]  And they still won't explicitly admit it, but all of their actions are a confession to this crime, a confession to this sin that was the cover-up of his cognitive decline.
[01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.170]  I mean, he backed out of the race!
[01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:27.762]  Because he lost his mind and he can't admit it because if he admits it then he can't be the president for the next six months.
[01:03:28.524 --> 01:03:31.551]  He's gotta pardon Hunter first, then he can admit that he's lost his mind.
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:39.410]  And what Harry Sisson and others said in clips that we showed is, Donald Trump just lied in the debate.
[01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:40.770]  All he did was lie.
[01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.451]  Jill Biden famously, he lied in that video.
[01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:46.612]  Somebody redid that video.
[01:03:46.652 --> 01:03:55.934]  If you guys can find it, I understand if you're strapped, but there's a video that somebody made reworking that clip of Jill Biden the next day where she's like, you did a good job, Joe.
[01:03:56.335 --> 01:03:57.635]  And what did Donald Trump do?
[01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:58.575]  He lied!
[01:03:58.595 --> 01:04:02.116]  And they put it to the Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin.
[01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:04.176]  And it's the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[01:04:04.196 --> 01:04:05.036]  I hope you guys can pull it up.
[01:04:05.076 --> 01:04:06.137]  Let me know in my ears if you do.
[01:04:07.817 --> 01:04:12.318]  But what they did was, they said Joe Biden actually had policy positions.
[01:04:12.358 --> 01:04:14.358]  He actually took a stance on different policies.
[01:04:14.598 --> 01:04:18.859]  We didn't hear anything about policy from Donald Trump because all Donald Trump needed to do was let Joe Biden talk.
[01:04:18.879 --> 01:04:21.000]  He was murdering himself with every sentence.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:21.660]  He couldn't touch her.
[01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:28.983]  So they've been coming after Project 2025 because they realize when they convict Donald Trump, it backfires.
[01:04:29.003 --> 01:04:31.304]  When they try to assassinate Donald Trump, it backfires.
[01:04:31.945 --> 01:04:34.086]  When they try to cancel Donald Trump, it backfires.
[01:04:34.106 --> 01:04:38.369]  And then you have the Elon Musks coming out and declaring war against the woke mind virus and buying social media networks.
[01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:40.230]  God, I hope he buys InfoWars.
[01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:44.594]  I hope Elon Musk buys InfoWars when we're forced to sell.
[01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:56.103]   Because if he could save this place, That is key to the victory against the woke mind virus, which we are also at war with.
[01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:57.003]  This is an info war.
[01:04:57.043 --> 01:04:58.324]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:04:58.344 --> 01:05:02.506]  There are graphics and printouts in this office from decades ago, just kind of laying around.
[01:05:02.586 --> 01:05:06.988]  Parts of this place are akin to a museum that say there is a war on for your mind.
[01:05:07.008 --> 01:05:12.031]  It used to be info wars because there is a war on for your mind is what you say on the old graphics.
[01:05:12.731 --> 01:05:15.953]  Back when we had gifts and stuff on the InfoWars.com website.
[01:05:15.973 --> 01:05:18.135]  You can go back to Wayback Machine online.
[01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:19.976]  There's a website, you know, archive.org, Wayback Machine.
[01:05:19.996 --> 01:05:21.517]  You can look at how our website looked in 2004.
[01:05:21.857 --> 01:05:23.218]  It's awesome.
[01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:25.800]  Awesome stuff.
[01:05:28.201 --> 01:05:34.250]   My point is, They are coming after this Project 2025 thing, and it's a straw man.
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:51.039]  They set up this fake argument trying to suggest that it's akin to Trump, that it's backed by Trump, that Trump wrote it, that he's behind it, and they're just attacking this Project 2025 thing, which is really just a distraction, and it's not gonna work because nobody cares about a 900-page think piece.
[01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:56.184]  Nobody's going around like, hey, I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I'm really concerned about Project 2025.
[01:05:56.824 --> 01:06:03.967]  All these leftists that claim they hate Project 2025 so much probably couldn't even name one policy within it.
[01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:15.271]  So let's see what Kamala has to say about Project 2025 and Clip 69, and then we'll hear from the actual author of Project 2025 and Clip 70.
[01:06:15.331 --> 01:06:16.371]  But let's run Clip 69 first, please.
[01:06:19.338 --> 01:06:26.620]  So Project 2025 is a plan to return America to a dark past.
[01:06:27.561 --> 01:06:36.143]  Donald Trump and his extreme allies want to take our nation back to failed trickle-down economic policies.
[01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:47.607]  Yeah, and I love how Joe Biden, whenever he criticizes trickle-down economics, this is like actually one of my favorite moments of retardation.
[01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:57.529]  He says, when I was a boy growing up in Scranton, trickle-down economics wasn't good enough for us.
[01:06:57.909 --> 01:07:17.496]  He said it a bunch of times in a bunch of different ways, I'm paraphrasing, but he criticizes trickle-down economics as like a Reagan-era economic policy that doesn't really work, it only serves the elite, and he says that it wasn't good enough for his working class, lower middle class, just American-blooded family when he was growing up back in the 1830s.
[01:07:20.779 --> 01:07:25.363]  But at the same time, as he's saying this, I'm looking at the President of the United States.
[01:07:25.383 --> 01:07:27.765]  It's like, whoa, you're against trickle-down economics.
[01:07:28.005 --> 01:07:29.066]  They didn't work for you.
[01:07:29.527 --> 01:07:35.011]  But you're telling me that you started with nothing, and now you hold the most powerful office in the world?
[01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:37.433]  Sounds like it worked for you, dude!
[01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:42.958]  Let's see what the actual author of Project 2025 had to say about it.
[01:07:43.579 --> 01:07:43.699]  Clip 70.
[01:07:45.865 --> 01:07:46.245]  Who are you?
[01:07:46.265 --> 01:07:47.005]  What do you do?
[01:07:47.025 --> 01:07:48.226]  I am director of Project 2025.
[01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:49.306]  It's you!
[01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:50.846]  I thought it was Trump!
[01:07:51.566 --> 01:07:52.767]  You know, it's not Trump.
[01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:55.007]  No, this has nothing to do with Trump.
[01:07:55.067 --> 01:07:58.148]  This, you know, was stood up years ago, actually, in 2022.
[01:07:58.588 --> 01:08:07.010]  But, you know, I'll tell you, probably the scariest part people are going to learn about Project 2025 is that many of us were former Democrats.
[01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:07.391]  Uh-oh!
[01:08:07.711 --> 01:08:09.891]  I know, this is breaking all kind of news.
[01:08:10.671 --> 01:08:12.332]  So, there you have it, folks.
[01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:13.931]  Debunked.
[01:08:14.592 --> 01:08:14.892]  Next.
[01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:19.135]  But this is all part of this woke mind virus that we're at war against.
[01:08:19.155 --> 01:08:24.698]  This InfoWar, which Elon Musk invoked InfoWars the other day on X. He just posted the words InfoWars.
[01:08:26.179 --> 01:08:28.861]  No other details, no other context other than who he was replying to.
[01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:32.539]  But this is mind control at scale.
[01:08:32.579 --> 01:08:44.082]  See, MKUltra isn't just about finding vulnerable individuals, conducting experiments on them, brainwashing them so that they can assassinate when they've been triggered and not even remember that they've committed an assassination.
[01:08:44.302 --> 01:08:54.145]  This is what is the documented purpose, one of the documented programs admitted by the government at the highest levels, declassified to the extent that there are any documents left.
[01:08:55.031 --> 01:09:11.139]  Surrounding MKUltra, one of the objectives was to figure out how to brainwash people to kill, trigger them to perform that murder or assassination, and then have them have no recollection of what happened whatsoever.
[01:09:11.159 --> 01:09:23.526]  And we have MKUltra, which is huge during the Cold War, huge during the expansion of the intelligence community, especially starting with the Red Scare, as we were paranoid about what Russia may be doing in the same vein.
[01:09:25.888 --> 01:09:31.490]  And this MKUltra program expands from 50s and 60s and gets busted in the 70s.
[01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:34.431]  They delete all the documents, like the retreating Nazis.
[01:09:36.592 --> 01:09:38.573]  And nobody goes to prison, nobody's ever held accountable.
[01:09:38.913 --> 01:09:47.116]  But the weird thing about it is, all of a sudden, in the second half of the 20th century, you have these bizarre mass shootings.
[01:09:47.396 --> 01:09:49.837]  And you have these unprecedented serial killers.
[01:09:49.857 --> 01:09:51.558]  I mean, I know there have always been serial killers.
[01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.639]  It's something that happens every once in a while.
[01:09:55.343 --> 01:09:59.765]  The Ripper, Jack the Ripper, whatever his name was, the famous unsolved one from hundreds of years ago.
[01:09:59.785 --> 01:10:18.635]  There's like a handful of examples of these serial killers throughout history, but in the 20th century, it's like mass shooting after mass shooting, celebrity shooting after celebrity shooting, presidential assassination attempt after presidential assassination attempt, bombing after bombing from Oklahoma City, Timothy McVeigh, or Ted Kaczynski.
[01:10:20.776 --> 01:10:21.536]  All MKUltra.
[01:10:22.097 --> 01:10:27.515]   I even suspect That the, the, the man who assassinated John Lennon was MKUltra.
[01:10:27.855 --> 01:10:30.478]  I think Jim Morrison might've been an MKUltra attempt.
[01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:43.710]  If you look at his father and his advocacy for LSD, Timothy Leary, all these, and yes, Thomas Matthew Crooks was probably an MKUltra shooter.
[01:10:44.938 --> 01:10:47.700]  Sent to kill President Trump and not remember a thing about it.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:55.624]  There's weird cell phone data, which we're going to get into, that someone had visited him at his work and at home, and then also the FBI in DC several times, apparently.
[01:10:55.644 --> 01:10:57.145]  We'll show some clips about that.
[01:10:58.166 --> 01:11:02.188]  And then the CIA came out, which is very rare, if not ever.
[01:11:02.928 --> 01:11:19.569]   They came out, I believe today, and issued a statement in response to the conspiracy theories that Thomas Matthew Crooks That was an MKUltra plant sent out and triggered to assassinate President Donald Trump.
[01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:29.033]  I mean, the fact that they are denying it is bizarre and drawing attention to it and actually made me think even more assuredly that, oh my God, they were behind it.
[01:11:29.813 --> 01:11:30.573]  Why would you deny that?
[01:11:30.593 --> 01:11:33.334]  They said, these statements are frankly damaging.
[01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:39.456]  You know what's damaging is the CIA when they put people like Alex Jones and myself and 200 or 300 others.
[01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:46.570]   on Ukrainian hit lists or enemies of the states list when they start coups all over the world
[01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:52.630]   and wars all over the world killing innocent people, trafficking children, trafficking
[01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:57.001]   drugs, trafficking weapons to the cartels and terrorist organizations all over the
[01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:58.890]   world you don't want to talk about dangerous
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:05.211]   it's the CIA, somebody needs to MKUltra the CIA but you have
[01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:10.183]   this clip here I'm going to show you 24 Mind control at scale.
[01:12:10.303 --> 01:12:18.789]  The point I was trying to make initially before I went off on that tangent was they don't just target individuals, conduct experiments, and then manipulate the individuals to perform specific actions.
[01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:33.319]  They also perform MKUltra techniques on the population at scale through the mainstream media, through the repeated lies, over, over, over, over, until you believe a lie no matter how BS the lie is.
[01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:42.283]   And then you behave according to these false beliefs In irrational ways, which are malleable and controllable by a deep state, by a new world order.
[01:12:42.303 --> 01:12:43.323]  This is clip number 24.
[01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:53.086]  And one of the things that we're dealing with in science is mind, well, I don't know how to say it exactly, brainwashing at scale.
[01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:53.906]  Yep.
[01:12:54.086 --> 01:12:57.987]  Where you cause people to see something they know it's not true.
[01:12:59.107 --> 01:13:09.213]  But they know that somehow to say, well, that's not true, and I wonder what is true, is to cross a chasm into opening all sorts of questions that they're not prepared to deal with.
[01:13:09.273 --> 01:13:16.797]  Now, right now, you and I are living through the crumbling of a crazy narrative that got pushed out.
[01:13:18.238 --> 01:13:20.099]  Joe Biden is absolutely fine.
[01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:25.710]  He's completely in command of the situation, and it makes no sense.
[01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:32.913]  He's now abandoning his re-election campaign to focus on the presidency, which he does not appear to be able to carry out.
[01:13:34.173 --> 01:13:41.895]  I want to turn this and ask you, how are we living through something this mind-blowingly stupid?
[01:13:41.915 --> 01:13:49.934]   This is basically a confession that everybody who The majority of Americans see it.
[01:13:49.954 --> 01:13:50.694]  They feel it.
[01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:52.354]  You're a Trumper.
[01:13:52.354 --> 01:13:54.074]  You don't understand reality.
[01:13:54.074 --> 01:13:56.554]  The president is absolutely fine.
[01:13:56.554 --> 01:14:01.793]   All of us who've been told we were nuts have suddenly been told you're not nuts.
[01:14:01.793 --> 01:14:06.234]  But the machine is gonna continue to go on and lie to us.
[01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:10.594]  And furthermore, there was no primary.
[01:14:10.594 --> 01:14:13.873]  The majority of Americans see it.
[01:14:13.873 --> 01:14:15.314]  They feel it.
[01:14:15.314 --> 01:14:20.314]  And when I say the majority, I think it's 70%.
[01:14:20.085 --> 01:14:23.548]  Very, very clearly see this and feel it, and they're not okay with it.
[01:14:23.888 --> 01:14:31.175]  And then you have 20% that will vote blue no matter who, because they are so deeply programmed to.
[01:14:32.356 --> 01:14:38.843]  And, you know, we don't have to get into the power of modern day programming and mind control, but that exists.
[01:14:39.043 --> 01:14:40.164]  But it exists in me.
[01:14:40.865 --> 01:14:41.785]  So, for example.
[01:14:41.986 --> 01:14:42.146]  Yeah.
[01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:53.830]  I can't get over the idea that I'm still a crazy person because for four years I've been saying that Biden does not fit cognitively to be in the Oval Office.
[01:14:54.050 --> 01:15:02.329]   But that's the risk of this technique is that you disenfranchise the individual's capacity
[01:15:02.329 --> 01:15:04.889]  to trust themselves.
[01:15:04.889 --> 01:15:06.250]  All of us. - Yeah.
[01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.889]  And so what I'm looking--
[01:15:07.889 --> 01:15:09.210]  That's what's at play right now.
[01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:12.889]  But how is it that I'm still under this spell?
[01:15:12.889 --> 01:15:15.088]  I mean, I've clearly broken from this thing.
[01:15:15.088 --> 01:15:18.050]  I've been talking about this for four years.
[01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:19.850]  There is no vindication.
[01:15:19.989 --> 01:15:22.351]  There is no absolution.
[01:15:22.371 --> 01:15:23.532]  There's no apology.
[01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:34.841]  The system is simply going to try to go and anoint Kamala Harris as if there was a democratic process in place, which I want to get into this.
[01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:38.244]  This is mind control at scale.
[01:15:38.664 --> 01:15:39.745]  It's mind control.
[01:15:39.825 --> 01:15:51.255]  Well, it's making mistakes, showing your hand at making the mistake, and then offering no redemption to the people that have known the truth all along.
[01:15:52.415 --> 01:16:09.450]   And that's, you know, we had talked about this concept of redemption, that if we were going to really restore the heart of this country, and if we were really going to set up the conditions for a prolific, indefinite human future, Redemption is a key piece of life.
[01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:16.156]  Redemption, but also exoneration, because a lot of people... I don't require redemption in this case.
[01:16:17.277 --> 01:16:19.379]  I require... I think you do, though, but go on.
[01:16:19.599 --> 01:16:21.581]  Well, because I don't think I did anything wrong.
[01:16:22.141 --> 01:16:25.784]  In other words... But you were made... Every... This is what I'm trying to say.
[01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:27.446]  Every effort was to make you feel wrong.
[01:16:27.466 --> 01:16:31.509]  A person wrongly accused needs to be exonerated.
[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.770]  Yes.
[01:16:33.304 --> 01:16:35.246]  Who is going to offer you that exoneration?
[01:16:35.627 --> 01:16:40.451]  This is my question, which is, what do I make of institutions?
[01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:56.827]  Think about the level of collaboration needed for no psychiatrists, no geriatric medicine specialists, Parkinson's specialists, no neurologists, nobody in the inner circle.
[01:16:58.237 --> 01:17:23.874]  More or less, it's like Murder on the Orient Express, where all of the experts were colluding to pretend that the bad people were the people speaking the truth, who worried about not having a functioning president, while we're in a half-proxy war with Russia, with a thermonuclear- He's absolutely right on so many different levels.
[01:17:23.914 --> 01:17:25.095]  First of all, he's brilliant.
[01:17:25.115 --> 01:17:26.876]  Both Brett and Eric Weinstein are brilliant.
[01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:29.523]  I don't care what you think or say about them.
[01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:31.324]  They're brilliant people.
[01:17:31.404 --> 01:17:33.785]  Both their performances on the Joe Rogan podcast have been amazing.
[01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:37.025]  Both their backgrounds, their intellectual accomplishments are just astounding.
[01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:44.708]  Not always right, but earnest, smart, high IQ, good values, principled people.
[01:17:45.888 --> 01:17:48.169]  But Obama basically said the exact same thing in this clip.
[01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.729]  This is clip number 68.
[01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:50.429]  This is what they do.
[01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:56.711]  You just have to flood a country's public square with enough raw sewage.
[01:17:58.777 --> 01:18:11.403]  You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing that citizens no longer know what to believe.
[01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:33.322]   Once they lose trust in their leaders, in mainstream media, in political institutions, in each other, in the possibility The game is won.
[01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:38.502]   And sometimes they slip up and admit that there's been a conspiracy, admit that they
[01:18:38.502 --> 01:18:42.543]   lied like Mayor Pete does in this clip number 53 we're gonna play in a second.
[01:18:42.543 --> 01:18:44.143]  But it doesn't even matter when they slip up.
[01:18:44.143 --> 01:18:47.703]   It doesn't matter when Kamala Harris accidentally mentions that the phone call
[01:18:47.703 --> 01:18:50.462]   with Joe Biden was a recording and then catches herself and corrects.
[01:18:50.462 --> 01:18:54.182]   It doesn't matter when Barack Obama accidentally calls Michelle Michael.
[01:18:54.182 --> 01:18:57.743]   It doesn't matter when Mayor Pete admits that they knew that Biden was in cognitive
[01:18:57.743 --> 01:18:58.903]  decline and lied about it.
[01:18:58.903 --> 01:19:02.063]   It doesn't matter when the reports come out and say the masks never did anything.
[01:19:02.085 --> 01:19:03.766]  That six feet distal spread never did anything.
[01:19:03.786 --> 01:19:04.767]  The vaccines don't work.
[01:19:04.887 --> 01:19:07.248]  They're actually causing myocarditis and terrible issues.
[01:19:07.288 --> 01:19:08.848]  I mean, I have a whole stack here, for example.
[01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.010]  We'll just go through this quickly at the overhead cam.
[01:19:13.731 --> 01:19:15.852]  COVID shots break people's eyes.
[01:19:16.412 --> 01:19:17.152]  Study show.
[01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:22.815]  Pacemaker patients experience heartbeat irregularities post-COVID and flu shot.
[01:19:22.995 --> 01:19:23.255]  Study.
[01:19:24.847 --> 01:19:27.550]  Microplastics in the brain have increased 50% in the last eight years.
[01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.593]  Pentagon admits it spread disinformation about the COVID vaccine report.
[01:19:30.653 --> 01:19:38.141]  Fluoride exposure during pregnancy linked to neurobehavioral issues in children and 620% higher risk of myocarditis after mRNA COVID vaccine.
[01:19:38.221 --> 01:19:40.924]  It doesn't matter that they admit it, because you've already been brainwashed.
[01:19:40.944 --> 01:19:41.765]  It's already too late.
[01:19:41.785 --> 01:19:42.646]  This is clip 53.
[01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.250]  Meanwhile, we have a new nominee.
[01:19:47.168 --> 01:19:48.789]  And was she aware of how he was doing?
[01:19:49.169 --> 01:19:50.450]  We're all aware of how he's doing.
[01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:52.571]  Our country has watched our president lead.
[01:19:52.932 --> 01:19:57.514]  And yes, we've also seen the fact that he's 10 years older than he was 10 years ago.
[01:19:59.535 --> 01:20:02.177]  And we've also observed that he's lost his damn mind.
[01:20:03.538 --> 01:20:15.625]  But hey, as long as it's not Trump, wouldn't you rather have a nice old man surrounded by competent people than a convicted felon, even though we have trumped up charges and a corrupt DOJ that came after that person?
[01:20:16.493 --> 01:20:17.455]  But it doesn't matter when they admit it.
[01:20:17.475 --> 01:20:25.293]  It doesn't matter when it's leaked, when the truth comes out, when the correction is made, when the fact check gets fact checked, when the debunking is debunked.
[01:20:26.775 --> 01:20:40.544]  Because the brainwashing installation is already complete, the antivirus software has already been installed in the minds of the people, and you cannot throw any amount of truth at them to convince them otherwise because they are NPCs, non-player characters.
[01:20:40.584 --> 01:20:46.888]  And for those of you in the audience who don't play video games, a non-player character is a character in the video game that is the video game.
[01:20:47.984 --> 01:20:53.568]  So whether you go to the blacksmith in the video game, whether it's midnight or whether it's in the morning, he's always behind the table.
[01:20:53.808 --> 01:20:56.670]  He's always ready to buy or sell armor or weapons to you.
[01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:57.691]  He doesn't have a family.
[01:20:57.711 --> 01:20:59.732]  He doesn't really have a story other than what's prescripted.
[01:21:00.012 --> 01:21:02.574]  And he is just operating as a non-player character.
[01:21:02.614 --> 01:21:05.516]  You are the only entity in a video game that has free will.
[01:21:05.836 --> 01:21:13.782]  Everything else is designed to interact with you in a pre-programmed way, just like the majority of our population in the United States and the majority of the population in the world.
[01:21:13.862 --> 01:21:17.780]   which has been brainwashed and programmed to be non-player characters.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.780]   They want you to sacrifice the first gift given to you by God,
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.780]  which is your own free will.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:28.662]   And then that will be the total satanic takeover of all of humankind
[01:21:28.662 --> 01:21:32.581]   while the elites bask in their affection for the ultimate evil.
[01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:40.181]   Total power, total self-worship, and immortality manufactured by their satanic technology.
[01:21:40.181 --> 01:21:42.981]  This is clip number 54.
[01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:49.702]   Swat saying the assassination attempt on Trump was an inside job.
[01:21:49.761 --> 01:21:56.284]  We were supposed to get a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service snipers whenever they arrived and that never happened.
[01:21:57.024 --> 01:22:06.209]  So, I think that that was probably a pivotal point where I started thinking things were wrong because that never happened and we had no communication with the Secret Service.
[01:22:06.749 --> 01:22:10.551]  You had no communication with the Secret Service at all on that Saturday?
[01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:12.131]  Not until after the shooting.
[01:22:12.672 --> 01:22:13.112]  And by then?
[01:22:13.492 --> 01:22:14.052]  It was too late.
[01:22:15.133 --> 01:22:15.453]  Boom!
[01:22:16.954 --> 01:22:17.214]  Boom!
[01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:20.457]  But it doesn't matter, does it?
[01:22:20.877 --> 01:22:22.878]  Because the different disinformation has already been installed.
[01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:27.579]  FBI Director Christopher Wray came out and said that it might not have been a bullet that hit Trump's ears.
[01:22:27.599 --> 01:22:30.480]  And the next day, they correct it and say it was definitely a bullet, but it's too late.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:35.061]  It's already gone viral among the left, that there wasn't really an assassination attempt, that maybe no shots were even fired.
[01:22:35.081 --> 01:22:36.321]  Joy Reid's celebrating out there.
[01:22:36.341 --> 01:22:37.481]  It was shrapnel.
[01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:38.722]  It wasn't a shot.
[01:22:39.762 --> 01:22:40.522]  Stick with us, folks.
[01:22:41.282 --> 01:22:45.322]   More great news and clips to cover on the other side of this short break.

[01:23:00.048 --> 01:23:03.069]  Because there's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:23:03.429 --> 01:23:10.671]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening, and join it, and promote it, and support Trump, and support us, and spread the word.
[01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:15.272]  Because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission, and you get committed, and you take action.

[01:23:48.578 --> 01:24:08.578]  [Outro]
[01:24:08.787 --> 01:24:10.368]  I am Chase Geiser, your host.
[01:24:10.688 --> 01:24:21.777]  For the remaining 27 minutes of this show and then two hours of the Sunday Night Live weekly broadcast, which I regularly host at InfoWars.com forward slash show or at Band.Video.
[01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:32.305]  It can also be viewed on Rumble, several other platforms, especially on X, at Real Alex Jones, as well as at InfoWars.
[01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:36.218]  Where should I even begin this segment?
[01:24:36.258 --> 01:24:44.961]  Let's talk about Google censoring search results related to the Trump assassination.
[01:24:44.981 --> 01:25:05.980]   So we saw today, all over social media it was blowing up, that Google's AI platform, Gemini, Is not responding to any questions about either the JFK assassination, apparently, or the assassination attempt of Donald Trump.
[01:25:06.981 --> 01:25:10.524]  And it comes up with some boilerplate kind of disclaimer in response.
[01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:14.187]  You ask it, what happened with the assassination attempt on July 13th, 2024?
[01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:20.513]  Says, oh, we're still working out the case here at Gemini, and we can't really respond to this question.
[01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:24.376]  Please make sure you fact check everything that Gemini says, because sometimes we can make mistakes.
[01:25:26.484 --> 01:25:29.684]  But it's the search results that are being censored as well.
[01:25:29.684 --> 01:25:32.604]  It's the Gemini AI responses that are being censored.
[01:25:32.604 --> 01:25:39.083]   They're trying to control and constrict the narrative to ensure that nobody has a conversation
[01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:42.963]   about what happened, to ensure that it's forgotten as quickly as possible because they know how
[01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:49.682]   powerful that moment was for the Trump campaign, for populism, for America first.
[01:25:49.723 --> 01:25:58.409]  How much of a threat it was to globalism and the deep state and the New World Order takeover that they want it totally forgotten and by God they might be successful.
[01:25:58.449 --> 01:26:00.311]  I mean there's only like one place on the internet.
[01:26:01.937 --> 01:26:13.879]  Other than Infowars.com, where you have a critical mass large enough to have a meaningful impact on the perceptions of reality of the people of the earth, and that place is X.com.
[01:26:14.479 --> 01:26:17.420]  And say what you will about Elon Musk, good guy, bad guy, hero, villain.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.000]  I think he's probably a hero.
[01:26:19.279 --> 01:26:24.340]   I think he's probably a once in a couple hundred years level brilliant like Einstein level
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:31.939]   Rockefeller level Benjamin Franklin level kind of just like a polymath.
[01:26:31.939 --> 01:26:33.359]  But he's even being just like everybody else.
[01:26:33.359 --> 01:26:34.439]  He's not a god among men.
[01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.699]  He's not an angel among men.
[01:26:37.699 --> 01:26:42.059]   So I'm sure that one day he'll disappoint us somehow in a small way or a big way or
[01:26:42.059 --> 01:26:44.340]   maybe in the past he's done some things that are really disappointing.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.340]  Maybe it's knurling.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.699]   He gets hijacked by the deep state and everybody's suddenly controlled through the microscopic
[01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:55.219]   threads installed in their brain by a centralized computer system and it becomes the end of
[01:26:55.219 --> 01:26:57.858]  the world in a sci-fi novel.
[01:26:58.549 --> 01:27:05.515]  Maybe he has good intentions, but everybody's going to get it installed in their brain, and suddenly having access to the internet isn't something that you use, but something that uses you.
[01:27:05.576 --> 01:27:06.817]  Maybe that is the end of it.
[01:27:06.857 --> 01:27:07.818]  But I think he's a hero.
[01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:11.181]  And his platform has saved freedom of speech.
[01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:21.491]  And I don't know if Trump would have won this election without Elon Musk purchasing X. Because of things like this story of Google censoring search results.
[01:27:21.511 --> 01:27:22.632]  And they've been doing this for a long time.
[01:27:24.308 --> 01:27:38.237]  I mean, years ago, I remember looking up American inventors, and I think they've since corrected this, but if you searched American inventors, they would show you images of only black inventors to compensate for some sort of systemic racism or injustices of the past.
[01:27:38.257 --> 01:27:39.738]  Like, hey, by the way, black people are smart, too.
[01:27:39.778 --> 01:27:40.798]  It's not just a bunch of white guys.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.701]  Kind of like what we saw at the Olympics, where they just...
[01:27:45.839 --> 01:28:03.755]  Insult all of the accomplishments of a culture or civilization or value system foreign to their political agenda of brainwashing you into being transgender so they can sterilize you and ensure you have no children and then control every aspect of your life.
[01:28:04.275 --> 01:28:05.236]  But this is clip number 25 here.
[01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:10.861]  See you right there.
[01:28:13.328 --> 01:28:18.772]  Try to type it in, it does not suggest Donald Trump.
[01:28:19.593 --> 01:28:27.019]  And even if TRU Truman comes up first, we're just not going to put Trump's name in the search result?
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:35.505]  And I saw tons of people, I didn't check it myself, because I saw so many people I trust rechecked and rechecked and rechecked, same exact results.
[01:28:38.888 --> 01:28:44.742]   And so, If Google's doing it, then does that mean that Amazon is doing it?
[01:28:45.162 --> 01:28:48.942]  And if Amazon is doing it, does that mean that Meta is doing it?
[01:28:48.982 --> 01:28:51.083]  And if Meta is doing it, that means Instagram is doing it.
[01:28:51.103 --> 01:28:53.563]  And if they're doing it, does that mean Snapchat is doing it?
[01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:55.484]  And if Google owns YouTube, that means YouTube is doing it.
[01:28:55.624 --> 01:29:02.265]  Oh, so 90% of the information consumed by the world is totally controlled by the deep state?
[01:29:02.305 --> 01:29:06.005]  I mean, it's something we've been talking about here on InfoWars for 30 years.
[01:29:06.886 --> 01:29:08.906]  I've certainly been talking about it the last one year that I've been here.
[01:29:10.552 --> 01:29:16.177]  We all know that this is a war for your mind.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:39.130]   And whenever there have been developments or innovations, whenever there's been progress toward a liberation from the tyranny of any conglomerated power, any deep state, Those technologies, tools, methods, developments, they always end up hijacked.
[01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:42.731]  Similar to how the left has hijacked our language itself by changing the meaning of words.
[01:29:43.632 --> 01:29:46.353]  Vaccine, racism, misogynist, sexism, anti-Semitism.
[01:29:46.373 --> 01:29:54.836]  They change the meaning of all these words from what they actually mean to something they can just apply to anyone at any time if it's politically convenient for them to do so.
[01:29:57.062 --> 01:30:08.209]  But we saw with the development of the nuclear bomb, yes, on one end it ended World War II, but then it kind of put the world perpetually under threat of nuclear annihilation ever since then, so was it a good thing or was it a bad thing?
[01:30:08.449 --> 01:30:27.399]   With the development of the internet through DARPAnet made by the government, it's amazing because it opened up the floodgates To the internet and all this development and the dot-com boom and just amazing social networks and technology, but then it was hijacked by the deep state to manipulate the psychology of the masses and weaponized against us.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:37.505]  And there's countless examples of these developments or changes that have at first been liberating and good and meaningful and amazing, and then get hijacked by corrupt entities and used against us.
[01:30:37.525 --> 01:30:43.048]  It's like Satan taking the creations of God and then just like malforming them, inverting them, and abusing them back onto the medium.
[01:30:45.282 --> 01:30:47.323]  And that's one of my concerns about Bitcoin.
[01:30:48.844 --> 01:30:50.825]  I am somebody who believes in cryptocurrency.
[01:30:50.865 --> 01:30:52.365]  I believe in Bitcoin.
[01:30:52.425 --> 01:30:55.407]  I think it's great that it's capped how many Bitcoins will be developed.
[01:30:56.107 --> 01:31:08.133]  I think decentralized banking blockchain technology is an amazing way to maintain anonymity and establish basically perfection in terms of the authenticity of all transactions and avoiding fraud.
[01:31:10.118 --> 01:31:17.844]  This technology is so amazing, but then when you look at the history of it, it's so cloaked in mystery who this Satoshi Nakamoto was.
[01:31:18.965 --> 01:31:19.945]  Was it Elon Musk?
[01:31:20.406 --> 01:31:21.306]  Was it someone else?
[01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:25.389]  Was it a group of people working for the CIA?
[01:31:25.549 --> 01:31:38.900]   And part of the thing, one of the things that's most alarming to me about it is how this technology's developed and then there's a proof of concept With Bitcoin, where it proves that it works.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.161]  I mean, enough people adopted it.
[01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:49.270]  There was this critical mass that was reached where enough people were using Bitcoin for internet transactions that it proved that the technology worked, kind of like a beta test.
[01:31:50.291 --> 01:32:13.473]   And as soon as this decentralized blockchain technology is proven to have worked after being anonymously made public, Then all of a sudden you hear about concepts from the International Monetary Fund of central bank digital currencies and cashless societies that Alex Jones has been barking about since at least 2001, even before that.
[01:32:15.374 --> 01:32:16.775]  Cops in black ski masks!
[01:32:17.496 --> 01:32:18.657]  Cashless societies!
[01:32:19.717 --> 01:32:24.201]  That's a rant that he did in early 2001 if my memory serves.
[01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:28.144]  And you're like, wait!
[01:32:31.627 --> 01:32:42.639]  Was Bitcoin designed by the Deep State as a test case for central bank digital currencies, which would be able to monitor and control?
[01:32:42.659 --> 01:32:43.861]  Because you can invert it.
[01:32:43.901 --> 01:32:47.064]  Everything good about Bitcoin, you can invert the other way around.
[01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.350]  To apply for opposite purposes.
[01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:53.112]  And I'm not saying Bitcoin's bad or Bitcoin users are bad at all.
[01:32:53.132 --> 01:32:57.015]  I advocate for something other than this fiat system that we have.
[01:32:57.075 --> 01:33:03.501]  Obviously, Bitcoin is much more convenient than physically holding a gold bar, especially if you want to have a transaction with somebody overseas.
[01:33:04.902 --> 01:33:11.347]  I mean, the gold would be great, I guess, in the case of an apocalypse where there is no internet or power, but Bitcoin makes sense as a plan B.
[01:33:12.867 --> 01:33:30.080]  But what if the technology behind Bitcoin was just exploiting and using freedom-loving, libertarian-minded, technically savvy people to prove that a central bank digital currency immediately adopted at a massive scale would actually work?
[01:33:31.401 --> 01:33:33.623]  And then you have total economic tyranny.
[01:33:33.643 --> 01:33:40.208]  So they have cultural tyranny via Hollywood and Disney and all these institutions.
[01:33:41.277 --> 01:33:42.557]  Like the Olympics, like what we saw.
[01:33:43.998 --> 01:33:46.099]  And then you have psychological tyranny.
[01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:54.201]  So cultural and then psychological tyranny through Project Mockingbird and the mainstream media infiltration from the Deep State.
[01:33:56.682 --> 01:34:02.564]  And then once you have cultural and psychological tyranny, then you establish economic tyranny.
[01:34:03.626 --> 01:34:05.627]  They've already got the military tyranny, basically.
[01:34:05.707 --> 01:34:10.490]  It's just this sheathed sword on the domestic population as of now.
[01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:38.563]   But once you have people economically strapped, and all of their communications are monitored, and all of the information they consume is controlled, and their culture is controlled, and their values are controlled, and their psychology is controlled, then you have a situation in which billions of people could be enslaved and not even know it, But I want to show you these clips because Donald Trump spoke at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee.
[01:34:38.603 --> 01:34:39.344]  I couldn't make it this year.
[01:34:39.364 --> 01:34:39.906]  I wanted to go.
[01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:43.433]  I had a friend that could hook me up with some tickets, but just too much going on here at the InfoWar.
[01:34:44.736 --> 01:34:50.478]  And I'm not criticizing Trump for being supportive of Bitcoin and I think he's got the best intentions and I don't even think that he's even wrong necessarily.
[01:34:51.178 --> 01:35:05.243]  I'm just very concerned about where this technology comes from and how it can be used and weaponized by the deep state to accomplish the opposite of the intention of Bitcoin as it is discussed today.
[01:35:05.323 --> 01:35:27.243]  Let's run clip number 48.
[01:35:27.284 --> 01:35:30.886]  government currently holds or acquires into the future.
[01:35:30.946 --> 01:35:31.306]  We'll keep 100%.
[01:35:31.366 --> 01:35:33.588]  I hope you do well, please.
[01:35:35.929 --> 01:35:42.533]  This will serve, in effect, as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.
[01:35:43.609 --> 01:35:44.670]  Let's play 49, too.
[01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:46.030]  This is RFK Jr.
[01:35:46.091 --> 01:35:50.013]  at the same conference, I believe, making a similar claim.
[01:35:50.873 --> 01:35:53.355]  And you got Donald Trump, who is the antithesis of the deep state.
[01:35:53.715 --> 01:35:54.816]  He's the populist president.
[01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:56.337]  He's the America first guy.
[01:35:57.357 --> 01:36:05.863]  He's coming out to many men when he's walking out, which is about basically getting revenge for all those who tried to kill you and want to kill you.
[01:36:05.883 --> 01:36:12.607]  I mean, this is somebody who I believe is going to shatter the deep state into a thousand pieces and scatter to the wind.
[01:36:14.295 --> 01:36:17.476]  But RFK Jr., in my opinion, is basically the CIA.
[01:36:18.636 --> 01:36:25.238]  Because he hired a former CIA agent to manage his campaign and then married her into his family.
[01:36:26.218 --> 01:36:34.841]  So he's collecting donations for his campaign, he's paying his family with those donations, and then his family is former CIA, if there is such a thing.
[01:36:35.201 --> 01:36:36.421]  Once CIA, always CIA.
[01:36:36.961 --> 01:36:42.563]  And yet he's coming out and he's critical of the intelligence community because they murdered several of his close family members.
[01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:46.030]  All while he's hiring the CIA to run his campaign.
[01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:53.174]  I mean, it sounds like he's faking being against the Deep State as an op for the Deep State.
[01:36:54.315 --> 01:36:59.037]  And he's coming out here in 49 and talking about Bitcoin in a similar fashion, which raises some red flags for me.
[01:37:01.639 --> 01:37:04.780]  I will sign another executive order directing the U.S.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:07.722]  Treasury to purchase 550 Bitcoin daily.
[01:37:10.874 --> 01:37:11.815]  Until the U.S.
[01:37:11.855 --> 01:37:32.492]  has built a reserve of at least 4 million bitcoins and a position of dominance that no other country will be able to usurp.
[01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:39.158]  Our nation holds approximately 19% of global gold reserves.
[01:37:40.185 --> 01:37:45.247]  This policy will give us about the same proportion of total Bitcoin.
[01:37:46.187 --> 01:37:54.690]  The cascading impact from these actions will eventually move Bitcoin to a valuation of hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[01:37:56.831 --> 01:37:59.772]  Well, I guess.
[01:38:01.453 --> 01:38:02.373]  I don't know what to tell you folks.
[01:38:02.413 --> 01:38:03.673]  I'm not an economic expert.
[01:38:03.693 --> 01:38:05.094]  I don't have a degree in economics.
[01:38:05.134 --> 01:38:06.114]  I read Wealth in Nations.
[01:38:06.434 --> 01:38:07.795]  I've read Milton Friedman's books.
[01:38:10.717 --> 01:38:13.598]  I've read several economic books.
[01:38:13.618 --> 01:38:16.779]  I'm familiar with Keynesian economics and Austrian economics.
[01:38:16.819 --> 01:38:17.660]  I'm familiar with Ron Paul.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.862]  I'm familiar with contemporary economic theory and common sense.
[01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:37.159]  And obviously our fractional reserve banking system is unsustainable and it's built on debt and dependent on debt and the debt must expand and inflation will always be a problem and it just won't work forever.
[01:38:37.219 --> 01:38:41.002]  It'll collapse and it'll be a brutal Ponzi level of collapse when it happens.
[01:38:41.062 --> 01:38:41.983]  Painful for everyone.
[01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:50.289]  And I hope that that Bitcoin is the answer or some cryptocurrency or this blockchain technology.
[01:38:52.231 --> 01:39:02.375]   But The future is clouded by the dark side of the force, and the dark side is definitely working within this system, this operation.
[01:39:03.735 --> 01:39:14.603]  And just like what happened with the Tor Browser, the Deep State came out with a Tor Browser which was supposed to be this private browser making it impossible to track the behavior of any person from any device in terms of what they do on the internet.
[01:39:15.303 --> 01:39:23.989]  Turns out that the Tor Browser was created secretly by the Deep State, released, and then there were back doors that were installed all over it so they could trace all of your actions whenever they needed to.
[01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:24.910]  NSA and others.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:39.434]  So they have a history of releasing things anonymously and publicly via the internet, advanced technology like this, whether it's a Tor browser or cryptocurrencies, and then putting unseen or unknown backdoors in this technology.
[01:39:39.454 --> 01:39:43.238]  And I know the white paper's all public and stuff for Bitcoin, but...
[01:39:44.923 --> 01:39:49.327]  They put back doors in this technology so that they can use it and weaponize it for the opposite of what it's supposed to do.
[01:39:49.347 --> 01:39:54.532]  Tor Browser was supposed to keep your privacy great, and it was actually the vulnerability to your privacy.
[01:39:55.193 --> 01:40:01.519]  Bitcoin is supposed to liberate you economically, but the blockchain technology behind it is going to be weaponized by the International Monetary Fund.
[01:40:02.267 --> 01:40:10.774]  For Central Bank Digital Currencies, which are going to control all of your transactions and allow you only portions of your own money to be spent on specific things.
[01:40:10.794 --> 01:40:17.199]  I mean, with this technology, they can say if you have a thousand dollars in your bank account that you're only allowed to spend a hundred of it on fossil fuels this month.
[01:40:17.719 --> 01:40:20.442]  Even if you have $1,000, you can't spend it all on fossil fuels if you want.
[01:40:20.982 --> 01:40:21.783]  You're only allocated it.
[01:40:22.043 --> 01:40:27.128]  That's the level of control that central bank digital currencies provide governments.
[01:40:27.148 --> 01:40:38.298]  That's why the CCP was one of the first governments to launch its own cryptocurrency and tie it and tether it to a social credit score so they can control the behavior, thoughts, beliefs of their entire population on a massive scale.
[01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:41.711]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[01:40:42.151 --> 01:40:51.434]  The 30,000, over 30,000, military-aged Chinese nationals that came across the border illegally into the United States did not come here because they escaped China.
[01:40:51.554 --> 01:40:53.655]  It is impossible to escape China.
[01:40:53.675 --> 01:40:55.135]  You want to talk about an open-air prison?
[01:40:55.415 --> 01:40:57.356]  That's any communist nation.
[01:40:59.137 --> 01:41:03.858]  Those people were sent here by the CCP as sleeper cells.
[01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:14.821]  All while our leaders, the Vice President of the United States, who may be the next president, God forbid, probably not, but God forbid, we should not underestimate this woman.
[01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:25.874]  Celebrates in clip 32, the defunding of the police gives support to bailing out criminals during the summer of love, the George Floyd protests, and then lies about it.
[01:41:26.094 --> 01:41:27.155]  But we have the receipts.
[01:41:27.195 --> 01:41:34.341]  We have all of the tweets proving that she supported bailing out criminals during these protests, who then later committed even more crimes.
[01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:39.625]  Now she's lying about it, backpedaling it, just like they've been backpedaling all week that she was ever the borders are.
[01:41:39.645 --> 01:41:40.686]  I'll show you some clips of that too.
[01:41:41.784 --> 01:41:42.765]  As we go on.
[01:41:42.805 --> 01:41:44.066]  But watch here, clip 32.
[01:41:44.326 --> 01:41:47.969]  Kamala Harris gives support to defund the police movement.
[01:41:50.091 --> 01:41:56.255]  Part of this movement, and it's not just a moment, it's a movement, standing on the shoulders of the movements before.
[01:41:57.196 --> 01:42:03.401]  Part of this has to be about changing the system, rehauling the system, upending the system.
[01:42:03.881 --> 01:42:06.563]  And so that piece of it, you're right.
[01:42:06.683 --> 01:42:09.786]  Under this attorney general, I have no hope for it being implemented.
[01:42:10.714 --> 01:42:14.015]  But God willing, he will be out of that office shortly.
[01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:19.096]  And then we need to have a requirement that that office do the right thing going forward.
[01:42:19.776 --> 01:42:25.818]  So then if you're for overhauling, where do you stand on defund the police?
[01:42:26.438 --> 01:42:26.658]  Right.
[01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:28.438]  So here's the thing.
[01:42:28.779 --> 01:42:29.919]  Defund the police.
[01:42:30.939 --> 01:42:49.863]   The issue behind it is that we need to reimagine how we are creating safety and When you have many cities that have one third of their entire city budget focused on policing, we know that is not the smart way and the best way or the right way to achieve safety.
[01:42:50.649 --> 01:42:57.571]  If for too long, the status quo thinking has been you get more safety by putting more cops on the street.
[01:42:57.591 --> 01:42:58.631]  Well, that's wrong.
[01:42:59.171 --> 01:43:06.653]  Because by the way, if you want to look at upper middle class suburban neighborhoods, they don't have that patrol car.
[01:43:06.933 --> 01:43:09.034]  They don't have those police walk in those streets.
[01:43:09.454 --> 01:43:10.514]  But what they do have.
[01:43:10.804 --> 01:43:16.804]   They have well-funded schools. What they do have is homeownership, high homeownership rates.
[01:43:16.804 --> 01:43:21.844]   What they do have are thriving small businesses. What they do have is access to public health and
[01:43:21.844 --> 01:43:29.604]   mental health services. So this whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look
[01:43:29.604 --> 01:43:33.363]   at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities.
[01:43:33.363 --> 01:43:44.003]   That's Kamala Harris for you. Defunding the police, opening the border for invasion,
[01:43:44.003 --> 01:43:48.163]  and allowing the burning of Troy.
[01:43:48.373 --> 01:43:49.494]  So many Trojan horses.
[01:43:50.134 --> 01:43:52.296]  And even the left is skeptical.
[01:43:52.316 --> 01:43:59.280]  We showed you the clip last week of AOC saying that there was a schism within the Democratic Party as to whether or not Kamala Harris should even be the candidate.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.221]  And we've seen all these endorsements come out.
[01:44:02.116 --> 01:44:09.179]  This week, even from the Obamas, there was a phone call that was recorded and they endorsed her finally after some reluctance and the Clintons endorsed her as well.
[01:44:09.759 --> 01:44:12.441]  But just because there's an endorsement doesn't mean that there isn't a schism.
[01:44:12.481 --> 01:44:17.463]  And keep in mind, folks, that the Democrats were universally behind Joe Biden until they weren't.
[01:44:19.524 --> 01:44:24.666]  And we have the CNN roundtable in clip 31 dissing Kamala Harris.
[01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:34.064]  As an expression of some of the conflicting sentiments within the Democratic Party and the leftist deep state.
[01:44:37.445 --> 01:44:38.086]  Interesting news.
[01:44:38.186 --> 01:44:45.529]  Recent focus groups conducted by the super PAC Republican voters against Trump found that swing voters don't like Harris.
[01:44:46.009 --> 01:44:52.411]  And focus groups conducted by the Democratic National Committee also found Harris rubs some people the wrong way.
[01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:56.273]  So Jonah, how big a drag is Kamala Harris on the ticket?
[01:44:56.670 --> 01:44:57.731]  I think she's a pretty big drag.
[01:44:57.751 --> 01:45:03.495]  I think she was arguably Biden's worst political decision of his presidency, to pick her in the first place.
[01:45:03.956 --> 01:45:08.840]  And one of the special reasons that she's a drag is Biden's age concerns people.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.881]  They worry that he can't fill a term.
[01:45:10.981 --> 01:45:12.342]  They worry that he's not up to the job.
[01:45:12.683 --> 01:45:15.805]  And so the vice president matters more than they normally do.
[01:45:16.206 --> 01:45:24.929]   I generally think going into the future that Democrats really should not nominate or front people who come from decidedly all blue
[01:45:24.929 --> 01:45:29.048]   states, unless they're like once-in-a-generation talents like Barack Obama.
[01:45:29.048 --> 01:45:33.449]   Because Kamala Harris does not know how to talk to the center or to the right.
[01:45:33.449 --> 01:45:36.729]   She only really knows how to sort of speak the language of the base of the party, and
[01:45:36.729 --> 01:45:37.729]  that's 34% elected.
[01:45:37.729 --> 01:45:42.649]   Let me pick up on that, because it's not just focus groups that are down on Harris right
[01:45:42.998 --> 01:45:50.949]  In a recent poll, national poll, 40% approved of the Vice President's job performance, while 55% disapproved.
[01:45:51.010 --> 01:46:09.638]   And Karen, to Jonah's point, Given the fact that people are so worried, voters on all political stripes, are so worried about Biden's age and whether he's going to last for four more years, is it a problem when they're not very satisfied or reassured by the person who would succeed him?
[01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:10.498]  Doesn't really matter.
[01:46:10.538 --> 01:46:11.959]  She's not going to be replaced.
[01:46:12.179 --> 01:46:13.139]  And they don't like her.
[01:46:13.179 --> 01:46:14.640]  There's lots of reasons they don't like her.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:17.240]  And I don't think the vice president matters as much as people think.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:18.261]  I don't think they think about her.
[01:46:20.081 --> 01:46:21.322]  Yes, I get that.
[01:46:21.682 --> 01:46:25.944]  I get that, but right now I don't think that's the first thing they think about is her necessarily.
[01:46:26.424 --> 01:46:28.264]  I just don't, I think they've not liked her.
[01:46:28.424 --> 01:46:36.287]  She's had not a successful vice presidency, although I don't know what that means at all because I don't think people thought of Mike Pence very much or Dan Quayle or anybody else.
[01:46:36.627 --> 01:46:38.488]  And so it doesn't matter because she's not going anywhere.
[01:46:38.688 --> 01:46:39.709]  He's not going to replace her.
[01:46:39.729 --> 01:46:40.529]  Think about that.
[01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:42.630]  Think about the earthquake that would cause.
[01:46:43.610 --> 01:46:47.993]  I mean, I think Jonah's right, though, in the sense that she really does struggle with her communication skills.
[01:46:48.013 --> 01:46:48.214]  She does.
[01:46:48.234 --> 01:46:53.738]  She really, really— Well, it's so interesting you say that, because the vice president— By the way, just notice the production here.
[01:46:54.618 --> 01:46:57.641]  Nobody sits in a room like that to have a conversation.
[01:46:57.841 --> 01:47:00.263]  They do the same thing on The View.
[01:47:00.363 --> 01:47:02.004]  They do the same thing on The Five.
[01:47:04.289 --> 01:47:05.510]  And outnumbered on Fox.
[01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:08.232]  Who sits in a room like that to have a conversation?
[01:47:08.352 --> 01:47:17.199]  Oh, we're just like you folks, just sitting around in our suits in this fake room with this fake background and these fake plants and this fake coffee table with our cups full of coffee that we never drink.
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:18.440]  It's just bizarre.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.704]  It's like a symbol or a metaphor for the entire establishment corporate media itself.
[01:47:26.502 --> 01:47:32.544]  Media writes a story, Kamala Harris finds her voice, and usually it's on the abortion message.
[01:47:32.885 --> 01:47:41.588]  If she had a strong, consistent voice and was really finding a lot of success as vice president, we wouldn't read an article every six months about her finding her voice.
[01:47:41.608 --> 01:47:43.369]  Yes, because no one ever writes about women and their voices.
[01:47:43.409 --> 01:47:45.550]  No one ever writes about women smiling or being appealing.
[01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:47.911]  You know, I kind of anticipated this.
[01:47:47.951 --> 01:47:50.352]  People write about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:47:50.392 --> 01:47:50.992]  and his voice.
[01:47:51.032 --> 01:47:51.832]  Not that much.
[01:47:51.912 --> 01:47:52.353]  Come on.
[01:47:52.373 --> 01:47:54.633]  And it's a particularly annoying voice, by the way.
[01:47:54.673 --> 01:47:56.454]  But that's besides the point.
[01:47:56.474 --> 01:47:58.435]  No, it's precisely the point.
[01:47:58.455 --> 01:47:59.635]  Her voice is an issue.
[01:47:59.655 --> 01:48:01.116]  Look, she's got a problem with communicating.
[01:48:01.136 --> 01:48:02.317]  She sounds like a prosecutor.
[01:48:02.357 --> 01:48:05.318]  I would say that's probably what she was for years.
[01:48:05.718 --> 01:48:06.658]  Prosecutor?
[01:48:06.858 --> 01:48:07.719]  She's also a woman.
[01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:08.919]  She's also a woman of color.
[01:48:08.979 --> 01:48:12.941]  I'm not blaming it on that, necessarily, but she has got a lot of inbuilt things.
[01:48:13.301 --> 01:48:15.782]  Are you suggesting that women don't face a double standard in politics?
[01:48:16.242 --> 01:48:17.302]  What kind of plan is that?
[01:48:17.322 --> 01:48:18.543]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:18.563 --> 01:48:22.563]  We don't sell fake plants, we sell real supplements, and they keep us on the war and the fight against the New World Order.
[01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:24.664]  Sunday Night Live, with me for two hours.
[01:48:24.724 --> 01:48:26.904]  On the other side, keep your phones close by for calls.
[01:48:27.644 --> 01:48:33.345]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it, by the tons, right?
[01:48:33.505 --> 01:48:34.006]  It's a lot.
[01:48:34.746 --> 01:48:41.347]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[01:48:42.068 --> 01:48:47.070]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:55.753]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[01:48:56.622 --> 01:48:57.242]  On the planet.
[01:48:57.262 --> 01:49:04.387]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[01:49:04.427 --> 01:49:08.049]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[01:49:08.409 --> 01:49:12.111]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[01:49:12.651 --> 01:49:18.895]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[01:49:19.475 --> 01:49:28.818]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[01:49:29.179 --> 01:49:35.821]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[01:49:36.556 --> 01:49:40.559]  They want to do it to destroy the West, and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.784]  Both of those, in their minds, are legitimate enough reasons to do something, right?
[01:49:45.824 --> 01:49:52.129]  But let's look at silver, because that's what we're allocated into right now, because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:53.030]  It's outperforming.
[01:49:53.791 --> 01:49:56.032]  Where were we just four years ago?
[01:49:56.052 --> 01:49:56.032]  $11.91.
[01:49:55.872 --> 01:50:06.311]   ago, 1191. But now since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30 in the last four years.
[01:50:06.311 --> 01:50:12.692]   See the trend is accelerating because the geopolitical dynamics are causing its growth.
[01:50:12.692 --> 01:50:18.551]   It's not just a flight for safety. It's not just a way to preserve and protect your freedoms
[01:50:18.551 --> 01:50:19.551]  and get out of.
[01:50:20.163 --> 01:50:29.845]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[01:50:29.885 --> 01:50:30.806]  It's growing tremendously.
[01:50:30.846 --> 01:50:32.306]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[01:50:32.346 --> 01:50:33.066]  That's amazing.
[01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:36.607]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[01:50:36.647 --> 01:50:41.548]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedom.
[01:50:41.588 --> 01:50:45.569]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[01:50:46.089 --> 01:50:46.829]  It's a sponsor.
[01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:48.450]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:55.839]  So I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[01:50:55.919 --> 01:50:57.281]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[01:50:57.842 --> 01:51:00.906]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[01:51:01.307 --> 01:51:03.109]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:05.733]  I mean, it's like it's like it's on record.
[01:51:05.773 --> 01:51:06.654]  It's the best investment.
[01:51:07.054 --> 01:51:08.476]  The stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[01:51:08.676 --> 01:51:12.239]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil and everything's collapsing.
[01:51:12.259 --> 01:51:16.523]  We've got to be strong and America's got to threaten Russia and China to keep us as the dollar.
[01:51:16.823 --> 01:51:18.825]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[01:51:18.845 --> 01:51:21.467]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[01:51:22.228 --> 01:51:24.209]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:27.729]  They just tried to kill Trump just, what, 10-11 days ago.
[01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:30.310]  They are going for broke.
[01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:32.731]  I wish we weren't in this position, but we are.
[01:51:32.811 --> 01:51:38.592]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[01:51:38.912 --> 01:51:41.333]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[01:51:41.353 --> 01:51:44.133]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20-30%.
[01:51:44.453 --> 01:51:49.635]  That's what you want, and silver is the big mover in this economy.
[01:51:49.935 --> 01:51:50.815]  So, go now.
[01:51:51.275 --> 01:51:53.936]  The KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-300.
[01:51:54.016 --> 01:51:57.157]  We'll explain it all to you.
[01:51:57.217 --> 01:52:01.679]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50 percent premiums.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.280]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[01:52:04.561 --> 01:52:06.521]  And I talked to a person, I say, you need Kirk Elliott.
[01:52:06.921 --> 01:52:10.383]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[01:52:11.344 --> 01:52:12.906]  $2,700 an ounce.
[01:52:13.326 --> 01:52:18.993]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on the air, and it's the best investment, hands down, in an imperfect world.
[01:52:19.033 --> 01:52:24.119]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
