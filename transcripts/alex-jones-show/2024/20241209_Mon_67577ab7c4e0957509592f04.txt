[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.840]  InfoWars.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.600]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.820]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.700]  We are 41 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 5 seconds.
[00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:10.849]  We're good to go.
[00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:27.099]  They have decided, NATO, the New World Order, to plunge the world into the biggest escalation of military activity we've seen since World War II. Syria overthrown in one week by NATO, Israeli,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.840]  Turkish forces.
[00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.189]  The former commander of Al-Qaeda in the Middle East is now officially the commander.
[00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670]  Will be the new leader of Syria.
[00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.230]  CNN says it doesn't matter.
[00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:39.969]  He's Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.750]  Al-Qaeda is now good.
[00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.090]  I actually have multiple newscasts saying it's okay.
[00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.530]  He's good.
[00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.709]  You then have Romania and its election.
[00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:59.329]  A patriot, anti-war individual who's a former top UN diplomat who exposed years ago the giant government child kidnapping rings run by the globalists.
[00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.069]  Well, NATO said, we are in control of Romania.
[00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.930]  We do not accept him, and so there's now a dictatorship there.
[00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.409]  Meanwhile, Georgia is in the middle of a NATO-funded civil war, also to reject the elected government, because they don't want World War III. Who would?
[00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.310]  It goes on and on.
[00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:32.199]  And then, when Romania begins to respond, claiming Russia stole the election, so they overrode it, they are a NATO member, They intend to get in a conflict with Russia.
[00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.379]  They already have troops in Ukraine.
[00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.439]  They will declare that soon according to my sources.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:51.620]  By February 20th, NATO believes Russia will respond, and then you will have Article 5 invoked of the mutual defense pact between any country in NATO. If it says it's got a problem with Russia or anybody else, well,
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.360]  all of NATO goes to war.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.659]  That'll be official war with Russia.
[00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.740]  You see all these dominoes falling in global destabilization.
[00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:19.340]  I would expect more of that The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former National Security Advisor to President Trump, General Michael Flynn, will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 27 minutes.
[00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.740]  So we have that huge, massive development we'll be chronicling it all, playing the clips, documenting it.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.680]  And then...
[00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.030]  In the second hour, the big news, why the globalists are responding like this.
[00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:52.490]  Trump gave an important interview Saturday evening from Europe that went mega-viral over Sunday, and I have watched the entire hour-long interview multiple times.
[00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.949]  We've got all these clips out of it, 12 clips.
[00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:05.360]  In four clips, Trump says, and he does what he says, Means what he means and says what he says and does what he says.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.080]  That he's going to prosecute the entire deep state, including any Republicans.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.460]  That the gloves are off.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.660]  So that is really the massive news today.
[00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.379]  Full interviews at InfoWars.com with Kristen...
[00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.329]  Welker.
[00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:26.589]  All right.
[00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.769]  It's all coming up and more today.
[00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.129]  We're about to join 450 plus radio stations that carry us on the other side of this one minute break.
[00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.829]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.149]  Remember, you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.910]  You're the power.
[00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:46.550]  When you decide to share the live link from Admiral Alex Jones, real Alex Jones on X, at Infowars.com forward slash show, it has a massive effect.
[00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:54.529]  Make no mistake, we are living in the most important time in human history and recorded civilization.
[00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:09.470]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2024. I am your embattled host coming to you from the InfoWars studios, literally under Justice Department globalist siege.
[00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.610]  And despite those attacks...
[00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.810]  In the Nietzschean phrase, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.790]  We are stronger than we've ever been thanks to you standing with us.
[00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.310]  Like God holds the universe, gravity in his mind.
[00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.069]  You, the listeners of this broadcast, hold the transmission in the face of the enemy storm.
[00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.889]  Together, victory is ours.
[00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.110]  Literally see it before you.
[00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.610]  They declared war on us, and we accepted the challenge.
[00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:06.509]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, December 9th, 2024. I am your host, and we are 41 days out from the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States of America.
[00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:14.129]  And I watched the body language of Trump with other so-called world leaders, most of them globalist puppets, in Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Saturday.
[00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:21.629]  And I watched the British royalty creeping around, all the rest of them were really globalist royalty, Transylvanian royalty, literally.
[00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:29.930]  And they were in awe of Trump and just in full groveling capitulation mode on the surface.
[00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:40.930]  And that's because to puppets, the real thing, the ultimate comeback in modern history and the symbol of the global great awakening and the new renaissance is...
[00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:48.180]  Something that even to most of their evil minds, they can't help but be attracted to because they're just slaves of evil.
[00:06:49.139 --> 00:07:03.740]  And this perpetual motion machine of tyranny and globalism that's been operating really out of the British Empire model, it's not the British Empire today, but it's this corporate system, brought them up, trained them, they were born into it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.339]  And a lot of them, quite frankly, want to get out of it.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.060]  Can you imagine serving total evil?
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.740]  And only a few of them are actually completely turned over to Satan, 100%.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.759]  Most of them are just slaves.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.339]  And then seeing the idea of real empowerment and true human leadership.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.639]  And Trump surviving those assassination attempts and coming back from all the fake criminal charges and the rest of it.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:41.180]  And just deep down, they've still got some humanity and still marvel at Trump and marvel at Us, the people, coming back despite all the enemy chemical, biological, radiological, psychological,
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.480]  spiritual, economic attacks.
[00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:47.519]  Alright, so here is the big broadcast.
[00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:56.399]  I mean, this is just, and again, every week there's a new show that was the most powerful ever because that's the time we're in.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.060]  I've been on there 30, almost 31 years, and April will be 31 years.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.360]  And maybe every couple years I'd say this is the most important show I've ever done.
[00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:11.879]  And then in the last few years, every few weeks, I say this is the most important show ever done because we're in the quickening.
[00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.319]  Everything's out in the open.
[00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.500]  It's wild.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:22.300]  You don't need me to explain to you that that's not hype when I say each successive week we have a new broadcast with news that is the most important.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:35.600]  Where we're at right now is hands down the most wild, the most dangerous, the most opportunity, the most insane, the most over the top, the most incredible.
[00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:44.419]  I mean, we are in an acceleration mode, and there's Newtonian physics obviously operating here in the third dimension.
[00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.919]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:54.830]  And so good is just exploding, but evil is also exploding to try to match it.
[00:08:56.009 --> 00:09:14.429]  And the enemies of good are just going to kill themselves in the final equation, literally, in their cult as it collapses in on them, as they try to expend every ounce of energy, every atom of energy,
[00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:24.379]  Every neutron charge to try to stop us because the force behind them is just bull whipping them forward.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.080]  And it's spectacular.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.000]  So, here's what we got for you.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.120]  It wasn't hard to predict what the globalists would do.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.399]  They had it all pre-programmed and ready.
[00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.379]  In fact, it wasn't a prediction.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.659]  Trump gets elected.
[00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:42.659]  They go completely insane in the 76 days between the time he gets in.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.740]  They accelerate war with Russia.
[00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.820]  They accelerate pulling the rug out from under the economy.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:58.879]  They accelerate racial and cultural division ahead of false flags on migrants and others to try to say Trump's a murdering dictator.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:09.799]  They release a new virus or hype up there's a new virus and then use all the new deaths taking place from the poison shot victims to aggregate that number and create total fear.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.139]  They're doing all of that right now.
[00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.799]  Now I said...
[00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:30.049]  Weeks ago, I said, they're bombing them with storm shadows, they're bombing the Russians with attack-ems, and I said that this is meant to escalate them.
[00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.870]  That's not even my opinion.
[00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:33.090]  They admit that.
[00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:50.909]  Now, that totally turned public opinion against them even more, so they pulled back for now, and I said, watch, they're going to start big wars in the Middle East, they're going to destabilize probably Romania, And I've had expert guests on, like General Flynn, and others that predicted that,
[00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:52.950]  because Romania is a NATO member.
[00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.610]  They can get Romania in a conflict with Russia, and Romania has already sent troops for over a year and a half to Ukraine.
[00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:06.070]  Then they'll have Romania claim they're in a conflict with Russia, may even provide a false flag to blame on Russia.
[00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:09.309]  We've already seen Zelensky fire missiles into Ukraine.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.200]  Poland almost two years ago, and then blame it on Russia.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:22.200]  But again, the Poles shot them down before they fully detonated, so they got the tails of the missiles, and they were Ukrainian.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.740]  And still Zelensky said, no, it's the Russians.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.039]  NATO needs to attack right now.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:41.799]  Well, that's NATO controlling Zelensky, trying to act like, oh, they don't want a war, but Zelensky needs help, but he's not officially in NATO, so there's not the Mutual Defense Pact of Article 5. And so if they're able to get this conflict going with Romania, which they've now done,
[00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:54.059]  they said with no evidence, the Romanian Intelligence Agency, with information from NATO, it's basically NATO, there's NATO troops there, that the Russians influence the election with their media.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.899]  Well, all the media influences everybody.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.320]  Oh, so somebody can see Russian TV and doesn't want war.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.480]  And so, oh, this new guy that won that's anti-globalist.
[00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:06.679]  Yeah, the Supreme Court said we're not going to let you be the president.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.840]  We're canceling elections like Zelensky did.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:18.500]  He's been out of office for almost a year, but he's still there and outlawed his political enemies and all of the rest of it.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.279]  So we've got that information.
[00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:41.559]  And I've got high-level sources saying, Saying that by February 20th, NATO wants to be officially at war with Putin and Russia, and that they want to use Romania or another country on the border with Russia that's a NATO member to do this.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:55.000]  We've already seen the last week, Georgia with civil war, Romania's election overthrown, NATO dictatorship there, NATO, mainly through Turkey, and now Israel.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:04.120]  Overthrowing Assad, obviously paying off ahead of time the Syrian military to stand down.
[00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:17.480]  And if you've already seen that in just a week, I don't think it's a prediction to say you're about to see some other topplings and coups.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.159]  General Flynn joins us in T-minus 15 minutes.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.340]  Former National Security Advisor to President Trump and former Head of Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:34.399]  We'll get his breakdown on this, but we'll also go through what our source inside NATO sent me yesterday that I covered last night that's gone viral.
[00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:47.139]  So Trump, in his interview with the NBC host, so-called journalist, said that he's looking to get out of NATO. We'll play that clip in a moment.
[00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.509]  And then also he wants to look at probably cutting the funding.
[00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:07.450]  Well, he already got Speaker Johnson to kill $24 billion last Wednesday, but Trump is not president sworn in yet.
[00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:19.590]  He's president-elect, so presidents on record when their president-elect can go do tours, talk about their policy, start setting up deals, but they're not officially supposed to do the deals to the government until they're in.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.279]  They're trying to set Trump up in a trap.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.639]  Oh, did you get Speaker Johnson to cut that money?
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.639]  Well, you know, we're looking at once I get in cutting the money.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.100]  So every question she asked was a trap.
[00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:32.899]  And I mean, Trump is the best Trump I've ever seen.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:41.299]  And I'm not like Joe Scarborough saying that about this is the best Biden just six months ago we've ever seen, which was obviously ridiculous.
[00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:43.440]  The guy's a cryptkeeper.
[00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:47.379]  The guy is America's Boris Yeltsin when he couldn't even talk.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.419]  When I say this is the best Trump, you don't have to believe me.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:15:00.539]  You can see this is a battle-hardened man who's been through the fire, as he said, in the last nine years.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.159]  And this hour-long interview, I mean, I ought to just air the whole damn thing.
[00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.230]  I almost today came in here and just said, we're going to play the whole thing piece by piece.
[00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.190]  I'm going to comment on each other.
[00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:12.789]  That would be, I mean, it is a freaking master class.
[00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.370]  I mean, this was, every question was a trap.
[00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.730]  He nailed every question basically perfectly.
[00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.049]  I was, I'd seen the clip Saturday night.
[00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.309]  This came out Saturday night.
[00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.870]  And then I watched it yesterday twice.
[00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.110]  And I was like 78 years old.
[00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.149]  All the stress he's been under.
[00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.169]  Nobody.
[00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:32.769]  Nobody.
[00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.750]  Nobody could do an interview like this.
[00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:40.549]  And by the way, he's been exhausted before and done some interviews that didn't go too well.
[00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:41.629]  I mean, he does way better than I could.
[00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:48.909]  Elon Musk is great at science and engineering and running all these companies and organizational skills and is amazing.
[00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:57.610]  But where Trump comes in is just the sheer stamina and mental clarity to hold so many things in his head at the same time.
[00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.529]  I am absolutely...
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.220]  Impressed.
[00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:15.740]  And I'm just saying, it's not about kissing Trump's ass when you see somebody like this who gets better under stress and better at 78. I mean, I don't know 40-year-old, you know...
[00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:18.799]  Oratory geniuses that could do this.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.919]  This is badass.
[00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.299]  And this is godsend.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.000]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that, baby.
[00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:35.200]  So, Trump saying, yeah, I'll probably get out of NATO. Yeah, Trump, yeah, we're going to cut the funding probably to Zelensky.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.259]  Oh, yeah, we're going to turn Kosh Patel loose on all the deep staters, including Republicans that are corrupt.
[00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:42.379]  Perfect answer.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.580]  That's what you should do.
[00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.110]  You know, look how horrible Ray is.
[00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:57.769]  I mean, he just went down the line, but because it's so powerful, I'm going to spend the entire second hour on these clips.
[00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.730]  I've got 12 of them.
[00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:13.859]  Some are 20 seconds, some are three minutes, but I'm going to just judiciously, not belaboring too much, not slobber over the clips too much, but I am in slobber mode right now.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:23.039]  But that means the globalists are in absolute chicken with their head cut off mode.
[00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:24.980]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.000]  So it's paradoxical.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.160]  Best of times, worst of times, tale of two cities.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.599]  Can we pull up the intro passage, the first couple paragraphs of the tale of two cities?
[00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:36.299]  Because it says it all.
[00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.450]  Everything was going straight to hell.
[00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:39.410]  Everybody was going straight to heaven.
[00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.650]  I mean, we got this huge renaissance trying to give birth, which humans do, which the West keeps producing.
[00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:46.869]  That is our future.
[00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:59.190]  If we can get this thing like a starship from SpaceX launched, Trump's launching his societal renaissance, and so is Musk, and so are we.
[00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.869]  That's what I've been calling for for 30 years.
[00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:03.369]  We need to counter the globalist dystopia collapse system.
[00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:25.220]  It was the season of light.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.700]  It was the season of darkness.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.839]  It was the season of hope.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.559]  It was the winter of despair.
[00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:35.039]  We had everything before us and we had nothing before us.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.279]  We were all going direct to heaven.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.980]  We were all going direct the other way.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:53.099]  In short, the period was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on it being received for good or evil in the superlative degree of comparison only.
[00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:54.619]  Wow.
[00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:56.200]  Let that sink in.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.200]  And the point is, is the world's always like this.
[00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:04.640]  But you go through cycles where it's hyper-paradoxical.
[00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:11.019]  And we are in the hyper, ultra, uber, supreme turning.
[00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:19.359]  We are in the, not what the globalists predicted, this singularity where the future ends and history ends because they take over completely.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.279]  No.
[00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.059]  It's not a singularity.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.220]  It's a cascade of singularity-like events.
[00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:29.170]  And will we blow ourselves up like the mythical Atlantis?
[00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.869]  Whether that existed or not, we are now the new Atlantis, and will we blow ourselves up?
[00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.890]  Or will we make it to a Type 1 civilization, which means we can survive if the Earth was destroyed?
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:47.579]  And idiots like Niels deGrasse Tyson, who now came out and said there are no X and Y chromosomes, and said, a woman of the same weight as a man is just as strong.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.680]  I mean, just...
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.839]  You can have babies too, buddy.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.799]  He said, we don't need to go off the world.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.619]  We don't need to worry about this one.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:52.980]  No, no, no.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.240]  You secure this world by expanding into new resources.
[00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:01.819]  That's the nature of the universe.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.940]  Oh, no, let's not expand.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.160]  Anybody telling you don't ask questions...
[00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.549]  That's the New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:12.930]  Don't do your own research and don't expand and only do what we tell you and don't think for yourself.
[00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:17.670]  Baby, when somebody's telling you don't question me, you're in a cult.
[00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:20.849]  Or they're trying to get you in one.
[00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.529]  I want you to question everything I say.
[00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:26.329]  I want to show you what I'm saying.
[00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:27.869]  I want to show you why I think it.
[00:20:28.309 --> 00:20:36.869]  And then I want to talk to you and talk to my guests who are very smart and bounce it off and then hone what I believe Buy that brainstorm.
[00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:38.890]  That's science, by the way.
[00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.930]  That's culture.
[00:20:40.069 --> 00:20:40.470]  That's art.
[00:20:40.609 --> 00:20:42.289]  We all make each other better or worse.
[00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.710]  Best of times, worst of times.
[00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.410]  Tale of two cities.
[00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:46.390]  We were all going straight to heaven.
[00:20:46.509 --> 00:20:47.869]  We were all going the other way.
[00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:59.190]  So, we're going to go through the global military destabilization operation, which shows the globalists, with 41 days till Trump getting in, are like, we're not stopping.
[00:21:00.329 --> 00:21:02.470]  We formed our new northern alliance.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:10.079]  With over a dozen countries in Europe headed up by the UK. And we're just going to keep the war going for decades and that's the end of it.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.819]  And we think the Russians are bluffing and we'll never have a nuclear war.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.700]  But we're ready to have one.
[00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:18.180]  And we're going to now overthrow all these countries on their borders that are NATO members.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.859]  So NATO's now in control of the dictatorship of their intelligence agency and their Supreme Court.
[00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:33.670]  And says, Russia, people watch Russian TV here, they mind-controlled us, and so Russia has attacked us.
[00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.329]  Literally, I'll show you the articles, and so we're going to do something to them.
[00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:51.109]  So, they're playing victim when NATO's doing this, just like NATO went into Ukraine and did all that, and started all this crap decades ago, but really it started getting into a real problem 14 years ago.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.279]  And we've called it, you know, and if I had the staff, listeners remember this, but it would be powerful.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.740]  I guess we do have an archive.
[00:21:58.859 --> 00:21:59.500]  Let's see if we can find.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.420]  It was Scott Bennett who passed, never come back from Ukraine, very mysteriously.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.720]  He predicted it months ago here.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.380]  I think it was like three interviews ago.
[00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:13.819]  He did it probably six months ago.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.599]  So did Flynn.
[00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:19.380]  I know that both of them said Romania would probably be the trigger.
[00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:22.859]  And boom, we're here.
[00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:29.119]  So, and from my sources in NATO, they've been told, get ready for it.
[00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:30.200]  It's going to happen.
[00:22:30.339 --> 00:22:31.539]  Now, that doesn't always happen.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:39.740]  They tell the bureaucrats and the soldiers and the diplomats, the ambassadors, this is a sure thing.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.660]  But if you look at what the globalists are doing, they are on the move.
[00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:53.920]  So, what does it mean when a whole bunch of countries are breaking off into blocks and fighting with each other, and it's all over the world, and it's between major powers?
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.920]  It's called a world war.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:11.210]  World War I. World War II, the Pentagon and CIA call the Cold War World War III, but the public thinks of a new big kinetic war as World War III. So in popular vernacular, World War III is what has begun.
[00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:14.690]  It's really World War IV. I like to go with the technical name for it.
[00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:24.630]  This is World War IV. And it's cyber, it's economic, it's cultural, it's military, it's sabotage, it's fifth-generational, asymmetrical.
[00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:29.289]  Warfare and the main system is psychological.
[00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.190]  Information war.
[00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.049]  I like the truth.
[00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:36.589]  I neurotically only deal in that weapon system.
[00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:47.539]  The bad guys deal mainly in lies because they like to build a false paradigm in people's minds to sabotage the body politic as a rule.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.599]  They rarely tell the truth.
[00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:53.259]  There are other people that think they're good who will occasionally lie.
[00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:54.240]  They believe for the greater good.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.279]  That always, like the ring of Mordor, bites you in the ass later.
[00:23:57.339 --> 00:23:58.299]  I refuse to do it.
[00:23:58.839 --> 00:24:01.319]  Oh, if I wanted to lie, believe me, I could do it.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.380]  I just don't do it.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.339]  To the point my brain, if I even study a lie or even comprehend what it would be like to tell a lie, my brain shuts off.
[00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:20.160]  It's so good to not believe what you want to believe but make your brain actually look at the reality of things and then only put that out.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.319]  That is when you start getting the real levels of your potential intelligence unlocked.
[00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:28.470]  You want the brain boost, folks?
[00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.369]  Stop lying.
[00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.470]  People say, why the hell does Jones say terrible things about himself?
[00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:35.730]  Because I want you to know I'm just like you and that you can get better as well.
[00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:48.630]  And if God can take a person like me and raise me up against bad people and transform me like a sword in a smith, like a sword in a fire, then he can do it to you.
[00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:51.099]  I know how the devil works.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.980]  A lot of people have done bad things, but you still love God and you want to do better, but the devil uses your guilt against you and you think, well, you could never be a good person now because you've done bad.
[00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:02.019]  No, God can fix that and will fix that if you open the door.
[00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:06.839]  But then God's going to have missions, little ones at first, but bigger as you go.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.579]  Serving God isn't just about crying at church and feeling the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.579]  That's the baby formula.
[00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:16.519]  That's the Gerber mommy feeds you.
[00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:23.480]  No, you need to then go through the levels that God takes you through the degrees.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:29.400]  Humans try to create all these secret society systems that have degrees because that's humans copying how God really operates.
[00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:31.400]  God takes you through the degrees.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.599]  And I've literally started figuring this out like 25 years ago.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:40.220]  I would pass literally a degree and it would literally be the spirit of like, call it an angel, the spirit of God, whatever, like a presence.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.359]  And it's like, are you ready to pass the next degree?
[00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:46.670]  And sometimes I go five, six, seven years without passing a degree.
[00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:48.950]  I've passed like three degrees in just the last six months.
[00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.750]  So the degrees are accelerating now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.730]  I am going up degrees.
[00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.869]  And I want you to experience that as well.
[00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:04.150]  The bad guys don't want you to go to the archetypal things of life, the rites of passage.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:20.759]  Because it's rites of passage and struggle that also will unlock your body's ability to interface with the infinite as a receiver transceiver to then be able to experience the real knowledge.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.579]  But the body also has to generally go through struggles for the interface to be able to even come in.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.480]  That's how amazing it is.
[00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:29.880]  But I'm going to stop talking about metaphysical, which is everything.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.720]  And get into the big news with General Flynn and more.
[00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:37.660]  The globalists are trying to go into full war.
[00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:38.680]  Can we stop them?
[00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:40.000]  What's their next plans?
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.019]  What should Trump do?
[00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:43.140]  Trump coming out saying end the war.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.079]  Looks to pull out of NATO. To put pressure on them to back off the war, obviously.
[00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:49.700]  And so much more.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.460]  And he's going after the globalists criminally.
[00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:52.700]  He's publicly said it.
[00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:53.220]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:53.759]  Stay with us.
[00:26:53.970 --> 00:27:06.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024 and that means it's Christmas at Infowars and our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in just a few weeks.
[00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:11.490]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.509]  Talk about fun.
[00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.829]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.829]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street or at work or at their Christmas party.
[00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:24.880]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:28.519]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:30.660]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:36.160]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs at the AlexShoneStore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.160]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.519]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.940]  Can you hear us now?
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.200]  And the AlexShoneStore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:48.380]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:51.960]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.000]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:59.700]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:01.180]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:07.859]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head over the right wing of the chart?
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.559]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.059]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:14.940]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.720]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:18.920]  If you're blown away by these designs, this is just a few of them.
[00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:22.079]  There's over 200 designs right now at theauctionstore.com.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.000]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.039]  God bless you all.
[00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.940]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:29.369]  Whoa-ho-ho!
[00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.170]  Merry Christmas!
[00:28:54.039 --> 00:29:04.059]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, and the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the former top National Security Advisor to President Trump.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:20.609]  General Flynn has graciously given us 20 minutes to break down the major global destabilization operations happening in Romania, Georgia, Syria, Who's involved?
[00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:21.690]  Where this is going?
[00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:28.369]  Trump saying in a big interview Saturday that he indeed is looking to go out of NATO, that he indeed is looking to cut the funding to Ukraine.
[00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.990]  We always put pressure on Zelensky.
[00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:36.349]  Then it was in the news that when he met with Zelensky, Zelensky said, no, the war will continue, even though the U.S. funds 80-plus percent of it.
[00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.089]  Obviously, Speaker Johnson last Wednesday cut $24 billion.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:54.900]  But Biden had another billion squirreled away that he gave, so you've got the president-elect with a mandate for peace, with the establishment deep state still hanging on, trying to escalate global conflict to hand Trump a giant disaster.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.759]  That's confirmed, as General Flynn warned the day after the election when he was on with us.
[00:29:58.779 --> 00:30:03.779]  He said, this is my main concern, is they're going to start bombing Russia with attackums and storm shadows.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.799]  They did it a week later.
[00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:10.109]  And that got met by major global anger domestically as well.
[00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.109]  So now they've moved to these other destabilization operations.
[00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:16.990]  And I would predict they're going to have more coups, more overthrows.
[00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:22.369]  They are disregarding the election in Romania of an anti-war patriot.
[00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.250]  And General Flynn has the scoop on all of this.
[00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.430]  We'll also play some clips while he's on of Trump on...
[00:30:31.959 --> 00:30:37.599]  We're good to go.
[00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:52.819]  We're good to go.
[00:30:54.939 --> 00:30:56.299]  And this is historic.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.640]  This is extremely dangerous, though, because the bad guys are going to pull out all the stops.
[00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:03.920]  GeneralFlynn.com is the site everybody should bookmark and follow.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:11.259]  Also, follow the General on X. General Flynn, thank you for the time, sir, to give us a briefing on these fast-moving developments.
[00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.970]  Yeah, it's very, very, it's incredible.
[00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.349]  Actually, monumental movements.
[00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:25.410]  And Alex, we've been talking about them actually for the last couple of weeks, certainly post-election, but, you know, really the last couple of years now.
[00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:41.250]  So I want everyone, everybody listening to understand that what is happening globally is intentionally designed to stop Trump's agenda, which is the America First agenda.
[00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:43.329]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:48.930]  You just highlighted this going after these 300,000 plus children that are missing.
[00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:53.069]  I just got off the phone with my great friend Tom Holman just a few minutes ago.
[00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:09.150]  And the domestic agenda that Donald Trump has and that he won his mandate on has all kinds of You know, things to do with the turning on of our energy resources, you know,
[00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:17.869]  reducing crime, closing the border, deporting all of these illegals here, and really focusing on making and strengthening America first.
[00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:26.940]  So this is why we are seeing globally these events unravel and unfold in some cases, whether it's a Coup in Romania.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.519]  We actually had one in the Republic of Korea.
[00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:36.299]  I'm going to be with some of my Korean friends here this evening to talk a little bit about that.
[00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:50.109]  We have this incredible rapid movement of the Islamists in Syria to topple Assad, long-standing ISIS. You know, leader of Syria.
[00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:59.730]  And I want people to be reminded that Syria was really a concoction post-World War I, principally done by the United Kingdom at the time or Great Britain at the time.
[00:33:00.069 --> 00:33:18.720]  So all of these things that are happening, the 100,000-foot level of Number one is there is a clear intent to stop the Trump agenda from even beginning and from getting on the ground and moving out in the speed that Trump wants to move out.
[00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.759]  And I do believe that Trump's team that he is assembling, I'm in touch with many of them.
[00:33:23.059 --> 00:33:25.380]  They understand what is happening.
[00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:26.619]  They clearly get it.
[00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:34.779]  The challenge is going to be how fast are they able to get things moving once Trump gets into office.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:42.500]  And I still say, as I said before, Alex, on your show, that I still want everybody to pray for Donald Trump's safety.
[00:33:42.819 --> 00:33:49.880]  I will never take it off the table, the evil that he is facing personally, his family has been facing.
[00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:55.819]  And our nation has been facing it, that they would love to see the demise of President Donald J. Trump.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.079]  And I say that very precisely.
[00:33:58.319 --> 00:34:00.640]  So that's number one is his safety.
[00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:05.160]  Number two is this new Middle East that is taking shape.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.340]  I would say that we need to really start paying attention to what's happening inside of Iran.
[00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.199]  I have heard from some friends over in Europe.
[00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:29.690]  about some potential leadership changes that might occur there, but these people have to get on the ground first, whether they operate from the Central Asian republics or they operate from Turkey.
[00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:30.369]  Who knows?
[00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:37.250]  You know, these are the kinds of things that are going to start to take effect and the consequences of the things that we're facing.
[00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:46.320]  Now, I will tell you that everything that is happening in Syria is directly connected to the things happening Across Eastern Europe and certainly Russia.
[00:34:46.599 --> 00:35:02.949]  And the one thing that I will remind people of is because there's not a lot of conversations about China at the On the backside of all this, Alex, and to your great audience, is the CCP. China is the big influencer here.
[00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.809]  China is the big threat here.
[00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:19.869]  China is the nation-state that is fomenting much of this, and obviously they're able to do it from a position of You know, staying out of it, you know, from a media perspective, right?
[00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.230]  Nobody's talking about China.
[00:35:21.429 --> 00:35:27.989]  They're using proxies, and that was going to be my first question, is obviously if the whole world's erupting into what we can call the beginning of World War III, we hope we can dial it back.
[00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:30.630]  I was about to say, what's going to happen in Asia, General?
[00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:47.389]  Okay, so China, one of the things that China is doing, and I need everybody to understand this, while we are so distracted with what's going on in the Middle East and what's going on in Eastern Europe, China has been infiltrating into our system for decades,
[00:35:47.389 --> 00:35:56.010]  but China is taking a huge leap into places like the Caribbean, Cuba, and many of the Caribbean islands.
[00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:04.190]  They're The embassies that they're building in some of these countries, they have formed an alliance in South America and Central America with certain countries.
[00:36:04.489 --> 00:36:05.489]  Giant ports.
[00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.349]  Giant ports.
[00:36:06.369 --> 00:36:07.530]  They control most our ports.
[00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.769]  Yeah.
[00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:15.289]  Oh, like 80 to 90 percent of the ports, the largest ports in our hemisphere, the Chinese either own or they control.
[00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:18.030]  And they have an alliance with different countries down there.
[00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.369]  Of course, Brazil, Bolivia, and others.
[00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:39.980]  And one of the areas that I'm always concerned about, and I always highlight I don't want us to be overly distracted by what's going on.
[00:36:40.079 --> 00:37:01.989]  And that's exactly what the Biden-Harris-Obama What Cabal is attempting to do is to drive us toward a war that has consequences that we cannot imagine just yet, and never mind the exchange of nuclear-capable weapons systems between Ukraine and Russia,
[00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.929]  never mind the fall of Assad.
[00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:09.929]  I want people to understand that we have elements of Iran involved and still of all this.
[00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.809]  Another country that hasn't gotten a lot of play is North Korea.
[00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.070]  North Korea.
[00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:23.789]  And there are things that are happening that were happening in Syria that the North Koreans were involved in.
[00:37:23.889 --> 00:37:26.530]  So there's so much at stake right now.
[00:37:26.789 --> 00:37:34.469]  And when we talk about, we're in World War III. I don't want anybody to think that there's this regional conflict in Europe.
[00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:58.369]  We're talking B-52s.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:05.940]  Big, big, big-time capabilities inside of Syria and the types of targets that they were going after.
[00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:13.480]  And so there was an interesting article that I read early this morning, and I think that it's right.
[00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:20.900]  And essentially, the question was asked, who's winning the war in Syria, the Pentagon or the CIA? Because they're fighting each other.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.360]  It appears they're fighting each other.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:29.780]  It's like The CIA is backing, you know, one group and the Pentagon's in there fighting on behalf of, you know, of who?
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.039]  The American people?
[00:38:31.179 --> 00:38:31.940]  The American government?
[00:38:32.139 --> 00:38:34.139]  I mean, a declared war, declared what?
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.340]  I mean, we're not even certain who's in charge in the White House.
[00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:53.750]  And this is where, to take it all back to To the sort of the strategic view of what's happening, this is where, and I'm sitting at my sort of mobile command post here in Palm Beach right now, this is where I think Donald Trump is going to have to assemble his national security team,
[00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.289]  kind of a wartime cabinet right now.
[00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:00.260]  And make some decisions about who to call.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:18.860]  And I know that he's in his trip over to Europe and some of the statements that you just, you know, said that he had made about NATO and, you know, that he has said, I think everybody needs to be paying very close attention to the kinds of actions that Trump is going to have to take, even before he takes over as president of the United States on the 20th of January.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.739]  We are potentially walking into a trap, right?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.340]  And I think that Trump understands that.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.159]  I understand it.
[00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:28.400]  And I know others on his team understand it.
[00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:50.480]  And this trap is one where we stay into this cycle of war that only benefits the military-industrial complex and benefits the intelligence community We're good to go.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:12.840]  Items on the table, meaning the deportation campaign, the protection of children, rebuilding the wall that he started during his first term, and really get the energy community in our country going again,
[00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:14.900]  reduce crime, all of those things.
[00:40:15.519 --> 00:40:36.000]  None of which can happen on the 20th, all of which could happen in the first few months if we did not have these massive, massive distractions of these wars that we are involved in, these major regional conflicts, which everything that happens in the Middle East is directly tied to these coup operations that are going on in Eastern Europe,
[00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:37.000]  Romania, you mentioned.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.880]  And what's happening in Ukraine and Russia.
[00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:50.239]  And I want people to understand that do not take our eyes off of the Chinese wall, so to speak.
[00:40:50.519 --> 00:40:55.400]  The CCP is the big gorilla in the world.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.280]  And that was my next question in your limited time, sir.
[00:40:57.889 --> 00:40:59.590]  I know wargaming this, you don't know.
[00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.969]  The globalists are obviously trying to stir up any crisis they can anywhere.
[00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.030]  So they're not even sure what they can get going, but they're obviously trying everywhere.
[00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.670]  What would you expect to see in the Middle East next, Europe next, and then Asia next?
[00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:11.829]  I mean, what type of scenarios?
[00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:14.369]  You're not predicting it, but what are some of the hotspots?
[00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:19.090]  Because I remember, I don't remember what time you were on, but it was the last few months you said, I'm looking at Romania.
[00:41:19.429 --> 00:41:20.429]  It's a NATO member.
[00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.530]  They could be used as the trigger.
[00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.429]  Now we've seen a coup there over the new election, just unprecedented.
[00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:25.929]  I mean, what else are you looking at?
[00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.150]  Yeah, a couple of things.
[00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:40.929]  Number one, the internal turmoil in Syria still has to play out, and there's going to be some leadership challenges there or challenges to whoever is going to become the leader of this new Syria, whether or not Syria stays together.
[00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:41.530]  That's number one.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:42.820]  Turkey.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.079]  I think everybody needs to pay very close attention.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.300]  Turkey is a NATO ally.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.599]  Turkey has a lot of authority and power.
[00:41:50.119 --> 00:41:54.159]  Probably the second largest military in NATO next to us.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.320]  A very strong country.
[00:41:55.539 --> 00:41:58.820]  So I think Turkey is going to have to play a major role.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.480]  NATO's taking advantage of us because we would go, look, two things.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.280]  Number one, they take advantage of us on trade, meaning the European nations.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.099]  Okay, like terrible.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.119]  They don't take our cars.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.820]  They don't take our food products.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.800]  They don't take anything.
[00:42:11.019 --> 00:42:15.679]  They take, it's a And on top of that, we defend them.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.980]  So it's a double whammy.
[00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:23.159]  So let me just tell you, I was able to get hundreds of billions of dollars put into NATO just by a tough attitude.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.519]  I said to the countries, I'm not gonna protect you unless you pay.
[00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:27.420]  And they started paying.
[00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:30.260]  And that amounted to more than $600 billion.
[00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:31.400]  That's a big thing.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.659]  Otherwise, they wouldn't even be fighting.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.059]  They wouldn't have any money to fight.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:46.550]  If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely, I'd stay with NATO. Should Ukraine prepare for less aid from the United States after you're sworn into office?
[00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:47.150]  Probably.
[00:42:47.989 --> 00:42:48.590]  Sure.
[00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:50.570]  All right, we have General Flynn back.
[00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.449]  He has a very limited time, a very, very busy man.
[00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:59.269]  Finish up with your point about the Middle East, then base a little bit on Europe, then a little bit on China.
[00:42:59.429 --> 00:43:04.389]  And then in closing, if you can tell us, I mean, Tom Homan has said, no, we're going after to find the children.
[00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.550]  We're going to prosecute the NGOs and the administration officials.
[00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.409]  Trump has now backed that.
[00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:10.670]  I mean, this is seismic.
[00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.949]  Trump's telling the globalists on guard.
[00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.230]  So if you can just hit quickly those four quick points, sir.
[00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:23.500]  Yeah, so number one, what I was saying was that I think Iran, we're going to see some unrest in Iran here, and that's clear.
[00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:32.559]  I do think that one of the things that Trump needs to also make a statement about is he needs to tell this current administration to back off fomenting unrest in Eastern Europe.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.800]  That has to happen.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.260]  That's clear to me that that's going on.
[00:43:36.799 --> 00:43:40.500]  And it's probably elements inside of the U.S. intelligence community that are doing that.
[00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:43.659]  I'm glad to see Trump talk about NATO the way he's talking about them.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.980]  Basically, they've got to foot the bill.
[00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:46.559]  They've got to get involved.
[00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:57.500]  And also, I think the next big conversation that we're going to start to hear about is the U.N., because the United Nations also needs to be made to heal here a little bit because of the things that they're fomenting as well.
[00:43:57.949 --> 00:44:09.769]  Back to the domestic agenda and what I know Tom Holman is really focused on, and so is in the president, is this America First agenda and this largest deportation campaign.
[00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:17.369]  One of the big cartels, and I want people to understand this big cartel here in this country, is the Cartel del Sol, which is out of Venezuela.
[00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:24.690]  They're probably the The lead cartel, never mind the Mexican cartels who work directly for the Chinese government.
[00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:28.530]  So we have to take on this priority.
[00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.610]  We've got to juggle this crystal ball.
[00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.190]  We cannot let this one drop.
[00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:37.010]  And that is in addition to all of these things that are going on overseas.
[00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:43.030]  And if there's one guy that I know, just listening to him over the last couple of weeks, that has a good grasp on all this, it's Trump.
[00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.889]  Now, he cannot do this alone.
[00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:51.130]  His national security team, every single American, all of us, all of us have to weigh in together.
[00:44:51.309 --> 00:45:10.010]  And I do believe if we do this and we show strength as an American citizenry, then Donald Trump can do whatever actions he needs to take in order to transform the kinds of things that we are going to need to go through here in order to make America great again.
[00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:34.559]  And I will tell you that I do believe that Russia and the likes of Putin, Putin has been very calm because with some of the direct threats that he has been presented with, I do believe, and we cannot keep pressing him because at some point in time as a sovereign nation-state leader with the largest The biggest component of nuclear weapons in the world,
[00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:40.000]  on the planet, he has got to protect his own citizens and the safety and security of his own country.
[00:45:40.179 --> 00:45:47.480]  So, you know, you go after the tiger's tail too much, you're eventually going to feel the bite.
[00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:49.179]  And that's what I don't want to have happen.
[00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.099]  I don't want to see happen.
[00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:56.090]  And I'm hopeful that That Trump and Putin have had some exchange of information.
[00:45:56.269 --> 00:46:05.349]  I'm paying attention to what Lavrov, his Minister of Interior, or is essentially his State Department lead that Lavrov has said recently.
[00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:17.650]  So all of these things matter, Alex, and these are the kinds of consequences that happen when we have a pathetic leadership in the, I call it the O'Biden leadership.
[00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.090]  Because that, at the end of the day, kind of who's in charge?
[00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:23.389]  It's not Biden.
[00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:24.210]  It's not Biden.
[00:46:24.469 --> 00:46:31.269]  I think Obama, we've seen him pop out in the last couple of days, you know, with more comments about what lines need to be crossed.
[00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.889]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:33.769]  Outrageous.
[00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:37.590]  This is not a peaceful transition from one administration to the next.
[00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:50.590]  This is an administration that's currently in play who has basically gotten everything wrong And maybe at the end of the day, maybe this is exactly what they want to achieve.
[00:46:51.349 --> 00:47:07.530]  Since their loss of the election, maybe what they want to do is they want to destroy any opportunity that Trump has to be able to have an effective transition and to be able to have an early, effective administration with the agenda of an America First agenda,
[00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.889]  which is not what the military-industrial complex wants.
[00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:14.150]  It's not what the war complex wants.
[00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:29.360]  It's not what the security state Wants, led by principally the CIA. So I just, I pray and I want other people around the country to pray for Trump's safety, but also stay engaged, everybody,
[00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:33.639]  and stay paying attention to what is happening because it's all connected.
[00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:35.239]  It is absolutely all connected.
[00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:55.059]  And the big 100,000 foot level is that the outgoing administration wants to We turn over to this administration a war so they cannot execute the America First agenda that Trump won in such a huge mandate on during this last presidential election.
[00:47:55.199 --> 00:48:00.980]  So thanks for allowing me to have a little bit of time with your great audience, Alex, and let's just keep paying attention to what's happening.
[00:48:02.269 --> 00:48:02.989]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.130]  People can see your amazing film.
[00:48:04.269 --> 00:48:05.530]  It's so important there and more.
[00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:06.969]  General, thank you for the time, sir.
[00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.050]  God bless.
[00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:09.050]  All right.
[00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.650]  That was an incredibly powerful on-target analysis.
[00:48:12.849 --> 00:48:14.210]  You're not going to get anywhere else with General Flynn.
[00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.829]  Thank you, General Flynn.
[00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.690]  All right.
[00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:18.090]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:28.260]  I've got so much news on the Trump interview and how he's going after the deep state and the war and CNN and everybody in the left endorsing the leader of Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.460]  The new bin Laden is the leader of Syria right now.
[00:48:30.739 --> 00:48:32.000]  And they're saying he'll be the leader.
[00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:32.920]  That's all coming up.
[00:48:33.019 --> 00:48:33.980]  But we're going to break.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:43.139]  I'm not in court in Houston right now at the investigation by the judge of their fake auction.
[00:48:45.379 --> 00:48:46.099]  I'm here.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.199]  But we could be shut down today.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:58.400]  If the judge decides to let it go through, the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department has said he will shut us down tonight, and I'll be over at the Alex Jones Network on the same, you know, satellites, radio stations, radio stations.
[00:48:59.929 --> 00:49:01.349]  Infowars.com will be gone.
[00:49:01.769 --> 00:49:03.050]  Ban.video will be gone.
[00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:07.690]  But you will find me at RealAlexJonesOnX and at AJNLiveOnX.
[00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:13.809]  And then we're going to start propagating AlexJones.network with the news articles, the videos, the website, and a lot more.
[00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:21.309]  So mark down those websites, RealAlexJones.com, TheAlexJonesStore.com, AlexJones.network, at RealAlexJones.
[00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:24.110]  And I think justice should be served.
[00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.110]  It's outrageous what they did.
[00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:26.929]  Even crazier stuff's happened in the last three days.
[00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.150]  We've deposed a bunch of these people.
[00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.670]  Some of them refuse.
[00:49:31.329 --> 00:49:32.690]  Bloomberg's admittedly running and all.
[00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.809]  It's all coming out.
[00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:39.050]  But regardless of what happens to InfoWars, we need funds to fight, so we bring you great products.
[00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.070]  InfoWars doesn't own.
[00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.750]  I don't own.
[00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.110]  TheAlexJonesStore.com, so it will continue on as our main funder.
[00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.329]  And we make it so easy to support the broadcast.

[00:52:34.619 --> 00:52:36.539]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:38.460]  Unfortunately...
[00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.449]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:52:43.929 --> 00:52:49.550]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.369]  That continues.
[00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:51.369]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.230]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:52:54.409 --> 00:52:55.030]  I designed it.
[00:52:55.170 --> 00:53:01.469]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:02.949]  They are a piece of history.
[00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:04.949]  They're pure silver.
[00:53:05.369 --> 00:53:07.889]  They are minted here in America.
[00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.199]  2,000 of these.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.659]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:53:13.019 --> 00:53:17.059]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.300]  They are incredible.
[00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:25.079]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:53:25.179 --> 00:53:33.190]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:53:33.329 --> 00:53:36.510]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:39.449]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:48.550]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, we have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between now.
[00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:53.489]  995 and 1495, when tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.090]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.210]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:53:59.349 --> 00:54:02.230]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.789]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:06.630]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:09.869]  at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:09.989 --> 00:54:12.170]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:13.409]  They surprised me with this.
[00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.489]  I just learned this morning.
[00:54:14.489 --> 00:54:21.190]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:21.369 --> 00:54:26.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:54:26.489 --> 00:54:29.409]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.429]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.210]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:54:33.929 --> 00:54:36.269]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:40.050]  We've probably got 15 of those elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:40.869]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:44.829]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.889]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.710]  And I already called them.
[00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:49.849]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:54:49.929 --> 00:54:50.769]  So that means there's...
[00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:54.250]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:54:54.409 --> 00:54:56.949]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:54:57.329 --> 00:54:59.369]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:54:59.489 --> 00:55:00.630]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:01.849]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:03.590]  This baby is amazing.
[00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:08.949]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.869]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.110]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:16.809]  Fully published.
[00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:24.269]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:55:24.409 --> 00:55:32.449]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump meeting inaugurated next month.
[00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.250]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:55:34.489 --> 00:55:42.510]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:51.739 --> 00:56:03.460]  All right, I want to put out an extremely powerful report that just dropped at Infowars.com and Alex Jones last hour here on the poison COVID tyranny and how important it is to continue to expose that because they're going to launch new attacks.
[00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:07.320]  Plus, we need to punish the guilty and avenge those that were killed and maimed.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.300]  And we'll be right back with the big news.
[00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:19.889]  Coronavirus, COVID-19, the whole thing was premeditated.
[00:56:19.889 --> 00:56:20.949]  It was murder.
[00:56:21.329 --> 00:56:25.590]  It was active terrorism by a state against the world.
[00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:27.349]  Let's call it what it is.
[00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:28.730]  Here's the bad news.
[00:56:28.929 --> 00:56:44.530]  For 58 years, the United States, the UK, in collaboration with researchers around the world, planned to use coronavirus to instill the most tyrannical reform of society that this generation has ever seen.
[00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:45.369]  And they did it.
[00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:49.889]  Purely premeditated to make sure that we were cowed into submission.
[00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:51.030]  Do you believe the Olympics?
[00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.590]  Do they have the chance of becoming maybe a super spreader?
[00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:56.809]  I think that's for sure.
[00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:57.869]  1,000%.
[00:56:57.869 --> 00:57:01.150]  Peter Hotez, the mini-me of Fauci.
[00:57:01.489 --> 00:57:03.650]  Calls for police deployment against anti-vaxxers.
[00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:04.710]  It's worse than that.
[00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:12.110]  UN and NATO troops to take over the media lock down martial law and force inject you under the UN treaty.
[00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.170]  What?
[00:57:13.449 --> 00:57:19.429]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:26.500]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. We're seeing sporadic human cases, no human-to-human transmission yet.
[00:57:26.699 --> 00:57:27.599]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.500]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:39.000]  We've had SARS in 2002. We have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:46.500]  Dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[00:57:46.639 --> 00:57:52.179]  A five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.500]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[00:57:55.719 --> 00:58:00.760]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.260]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.780]  The health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.650]  We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security.
[00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:13.610]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.389]  NATO, this is a security problem.
[00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:26.070]  At least 15 federal agencies knew that gain-of-function research was being done in the Wuhan lab since, what, 2018?
[00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:32.360]  We've gotten all of our information from Whistleblower, but we now know it wasn't just one agency that China was approaching.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:41.739]  China made a presentation, or an American representative, Peter Deczak, made a representation to 15 agencies about creating a virus that, guess what?
[00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:47.989]  Looks suspiciously like COVID-19 and looks like no other virus in nature from that family.
[00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:51.429]  They were working on this and presented it to 15 agencies.
[00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:59.570]  And in 2020, when they saw COVID-19, they should have all been calling and raising the alarm and saying, my goodness, we saw this two years ago.
[00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.110]  We knew the Chinese were doing this.
[00:59:01.429 --> 00:59:02.789]  Lo and behold, they did it.
[00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.769]  Bill Gates says we'll never find a coronavirus cure.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:21.119]  That was in October 2020. So he's telling you take the shot, it will cure you, while separately saying in his own foundation and in the NIH that there'll never be a cure because they flooded everybody with all these cancer viruses, but there are cures.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.739]  So it's lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.980]  Let's walk through it.
[00:59:25.059 --> 00:59:30.300]  It's HIV, XMRV, and SARS. It never was a coronavirus, and that's the big lie.
[00:59:30.579 --> 00:59:31.199]  Let's stop there.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:39.079]  We are seeing Teenage girls or girls in their 20s presenting with stage 4 breast cancer.
[00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:45.050]  But they hid the fact from the FDA that there was a very carcinogenic substance within these vaccines.
[00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:46.389]  They continued to give them.
[00:59:46.929 --> 00:59:52.630]  And now we're seeing just an explosion of cancer, especially among young people.
[00:59:53.150 --> 01:00:03.130]  Matt Hancock, who got caught admitting that the COVID thing was all fake, it was about control, and his text messages that came out who ran the poison shot operations in the UK. More of his messages have come out.
[01:00:03.639 --> 01:00:07.460]  And now Matt Hancock is cracking jokes about Bill Gates' conspiracy.
[01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:13.059]  He joked about Bill Gates ought to be paying me a lot of money for all the people I injected with his chips.
[01:00:14.199 --> 01:00:31.800]  Well, he does own a company that does put nanochips in vaccines to track you, but what they put is self-replicating nanotech spike protein to cut off and self-replicate your DNA defense system, and then they load you with hundreds of known top cancer viruses.
[01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:35.460]  So it's far worse than a microchip.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.539]  It is Monday, December 9, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:46.809]  She don't like slavery.
[01:00:46.989 --> 01:00:47.929]  She don't sit and beg.
[01:00:49.889 --> 01:00:51.670]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:59.570]  Well, that last half-hour interview with General Flynn was over the top.
[01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:00.650]  Important.
[01:01:01.869 --> 01:01:06.730]  And we're going to put that interview out very, very quickly, but I want Wilson to wait.
[01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.849]  I know he's in there getting it together because I want to give the headline.
[01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:33.500]  And when I took that little break to play that special report on the COVID tyranny, I got to see going through the office of DOJ's auctioneer company that comes in here every week to survey all the equipment and all the paper clips to make sure we haven't run off with it on our backs into the night.
[01:01:34.179 --> 01:01:35.739]  And it's just a private company.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.699]  I'm not mean to the guys.
[01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:40.780]  But I did start talking to them.
[01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:46.480]  And I said, you know, when you were here last week, Well, you guys were poking around stuff.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.119]  You knocked off some of the restream equipment in there.
[01:01:55.239 --> 01:02:00.539]  And so that's how close the tyranny is to us.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.420]  Breathing down our necks, literally.
[01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.000]  And I got a little, not really flustered.
[01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:09.019]  I talked to them nicely, but didn't get to what I went out there to do.
[01:02:09.679 --> 01:02:14.119]  So then by the time I sat down, when the music was already playing, I was pissed off.
[01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:17.789]  But you know, I can't let what the globalists do piss me off.
[01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:18.550]  I asked for this.
[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:20.010]  I've been in this fight 30 plus years.
[01:02:20.889 --> 01:02:24.949]  And we're seeing giant global awakening and a lot of really good things happening.
[01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:25.949]  I want to cover this hour.
[01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:32.969]  And we got to remember, this is a war, so it's not going to be all peaches and cream.
[01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:40.170]  As Thomas Jefferson said, we will not be transported to a state of liberty on a bed of feathers.
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.010]  On a feather bed.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.500]  And that is exactly what's happening.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:55.699]  We are being transported there in the fire of asymmetrical warfare.
[01:02:56.079 --> 01:03:09.659]  And so as we speak, in Houston, the hearing is going on, and the judge says we'll go to 8 o'clock at night if need to, to investigate what the DOJ says.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.679]  Trustee, the DOJ can come into a case.
[01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:16.840]  Doug's already fired the last, he's fired two of them.
[01:03:17.639 --> 01:03:24.239]  So now, I keep saying one, that was, Pat McGill was the minion of the last U.S. trustee.
[01:03:27.199 --> 01:03:29.579]  And now they've got this new one, Chris Murray.
[01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:38.070]  Who had literally a fake auction on November 13th and then turned the internet off on 8 a.m.
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:46.250]  Started doing it on November 14th and I was on American Journal at 10.30 when they cut the internet off.
[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:57.710]  So I drove 3-4 miles to the backup studio with the satellite uplinks and all the equipment and the servers and everything else and went on air and barely made it at 11 a.m.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.119]  And people say, man, we keep hearing you're getting shut down.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:07.179]  I mean, May 31st, the last trustee that got fired came in here and just ordered the private security.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.179]  Well, throw them out.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.019]  Nine o'clock tonight.
[01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:09.800]  Close the doors.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.500]  I said, where's the court order?
[01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:12.179]  Not doing it.
[01:04:12.659 --> 01:04:14.340]  The private security company said, yeah, we're not doing that.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.980]  It's all just bluffs.
[01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:18.179]  It's all just vigilantism.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:26.940]  And then the new trustee comes in, and here we are six months later, and they're doing the exact same type of crap.
[01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:31.389]  Because they're the Democrats, and I'm a bad person.
[01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.829]  So, yeah, this has been going on for a while.
[01:04:37.809 --> 01:04:39.869]  And the judge said, I hadn't even authorized this auction.
[01:04:39.889 --> 01:04:41.630]  I had to have hearings about what you're even allowed to sell.
[01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.449]  Mr. Jones is objecting, and he has real objections.
[01:04:43.769 --> 01:04:45.510]  But they said they own my name?
[01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:47.750]  All this ridiculous crap?
[01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:53.340]  And the U.S. trustee said a few months ago in court, he goes, well, the 13th Amendment doesn't apply to Mr. Jones.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.699]  Close quote.
[01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:57.320]  He goes, it does to normal people, but not him.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.400]  No, public figures are even more protected.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.699]  The press is even more protected.
[01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:04.420]  Look it up.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.760]  Look up Newark v.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.099]  Sullivan.
[01:05:07.179 --> 01:05:14.039]  You know, like, in the First Amendment, religion is number one, and in general free speech...
[01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:17.840]  And write to assemble and petition for redress grievances.
[01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:22.940]  But in the interpretations of that, number two is the press.
[01:05:25.139 --> 01:05:37.860]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof or of the press.
[01:05:38.159 --> 01:05:40.980]  But let's pull up the First Amendment for people.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:50.340]  So Then they had the auction, and it wasn't an auction.
[01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:58.940]  And then if you think what you knew last week was bad, I've been asked by my lawyers, because I have all the transcripts and documents, the depositions, not to tell you yet.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.219]  It'll be in court right now.
[01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:03.750]  It is bonker town.
[01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:15.670]  Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or privilege as thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:18.190]  Grievances.
[01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:28.510]  So, there's a lot to unpack there in such a simple statement, but that's how the most powerful, complex, timeless things are.
[01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.030]  They sound simple on the surface, but they're not.
[01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:30.590]  They're really...
[01:06:33.429 --> 01:06:33.829]  Profound.
[01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:39.110]  So, I'm going to move on from this, and we'll have more news by the fourth hour.
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.969]  I'll be here with you.
[01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:46.329]  You're not allowed to record or air live federal cases.
[01:06:46.329 --> 01:06:49.269]  You see that in all these federal cases where there's no cameras or anything.
[01:06:49.469 --> 01:06:50.650]  But we can watch it.
[01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.889]  We can listen to it here, because I'm a participant.
[01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:54.909]  But I'm not...
[01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:56.590]  I'm going to not be doing that.
[01:06:57.449 --> 01:07:01.789]  I'll just get the folks watching themselves give me transcripts of it.
[01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:06.869]  And then we will know by sometime this evening.
[01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:09.150]  And if they announce, the judge says, yeah, you know what?
[01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.849]  It did go through.
[01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:20.230]  The U.S. trustee of the Justice Department called the security last Wednesday and said, yeah, be ready...
[01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:24.849]  In case Alex Jones barricades himself in the building.
[01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:31.929]  Well, the actual statement was, do you think Alex will barricade himself in the building Monday night if the judge says the cell went through?
[01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:34.050]  And they said, well, you'll have to ask him, but we don't think so.
[01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:38.690]  Only reason he didn't leave the last two times is you didn't have a court order.
[01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:40.650]  And then you turned the internet off.
[01:07:40.869 --> 01:07:42.969]  Then they turned the internet off, so I had to go to the other studio.
[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.969]  And I said, you're in a lot of trouble, I believe.
[01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:47.190]  And of course he is.
[01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:49.030]  Judge said the sale did not go through.
[01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.730]  It was not an auction.
[01:07:49.909 --> 01:07:51.510]  No one should be comfortable with what happened.
[01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:52.210]  Those are quotes.
[01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:57.530]  And now we learn Michael Bloomberg's financing these attacks on me.
[01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.730]  Wow, big surprise with his biggest gun control group.
[01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:04.150]  Everytown that really is financing the onion.
[01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:11.610]  And there's just hundreds of things that, you know, they said, in the rules, you can't, you can only have one buyer and there can't be subgroups secretly there.
[01:08:11.929 --> 01:08:17.689]  And then it turns out, we learned in the depositions, the name of the Newtown Corporation they created to fund and run all this.
[01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:22.329]  So it's not even The Onion, surprise, surprise, the former MSNBC disinformation specialist.
[01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:27.810]  Translated, person that stalks conservatives and attacks free speech.
[01:08:31.029 --> 01:08:34.229]  And That's all going on.
[01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:40.470]  And then they told the judge, well, the biggest bid didn't win, the best bid won.
[01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:49.329]  And then they last week told us, oh, actually, after our last filing, tell the judge the amount that was paid, we decided it was $7 million.
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.649]  And then last night they did a new filing.
[01:08:53.869 --> 01:08:54.810]  They'd already filed with the court.
[01:08:55.409 --> 01:08:57.069]  They said, no, now it's not $7 million.
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.010]  Now it's a whole other number.
[01:08:58.109 --> 01:08:59.829]  So this is like a moving goalpost here.
[01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:07.810]  And the judge is like, I want to know if any of the trustee or any of the plaintiffs talked to the auctioneer or talked to any of the people about prices.
[01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:12.770]  And then they're interviewing the auctioneer that did it in Denver yesterday.
[01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:14.109]  No, that was Saturday.
[01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:17.909]  And boy, that's going to be...
[01:09:17.909 --> 01:09:20.010]  Can you imagine what he said?
[01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:21.329]  Can you imagine what we have on video?
[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:24.069]  Oh, did he talk to them?
[01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.890]  Did they talk?
[01:09:32.019 --> 01:09:36.659]  Did he say, oh, sorry, this bid isn't as big as the other bid.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.020]  You need to increase your bid.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:53.899]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:09:54.119 --> 01:09:57.119]  And the best part is they memorialize it all.
[01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:00.210]  Because they're the good people, you see.
[01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:08.789]  I mean, like the Onion guy said with the Bloomberg head of the gun control group on Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America on November 15th.
[01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.069]  Oh, it's ours.
[01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.649]  We got it.
[01:10:11.289 --> 01:10:11.750]  It's ours.
[01:10:11.869 --> 01:10:13.750]  And Stephanopoulos was like, well, why is your bid lower?
[01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.270]  He goes, well, because it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:19.590]  Stephanopoulos goes, well, how does that work?
[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.590]  He goes, well, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.210]  I mean, come on.
[01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.449]  We can do anything we want to this guy.
[01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.670]  So...
[01:10:29.579 --> 01:10:41.899]  I don't know how the judge doesn't give it to the real bidder that was Moore and did follow the rules that I've said I'll work with and I've known for many years.
[01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:53.779]  A. Or bare minimum order a new real auction and we don't know how it's not referred to the Justice Department what they did.
[01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:56.060]  But you know who runs this Justice Department.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:07.039]  Though there are incoming Justice Department high-level former deputy attorney generals who said that this is already being looked at, and I can tell you it is.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:13.829]  So, And, of course, you heard Trump, that I'll get to that, come up in a few minutes, saying they are going after the deep state.
[01:11:13.989 --> 01:11:15.930]  Well, if this ain't the deep state, I don't know what is.
[01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:29.130]  The CIA, the Justice Department, Bloomberg, the top Democrat Party law firms, all of them in a giant conspiracy to violate my rights and your rights to be able to hear what you want to hear or watch what you want to watch.
[01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:31.510]  Because that's what this is really all about, is you.
[01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:33.149]  They're scared of you.
[01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.409]  They want to get through me to get to you.
[01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:45.710]  Well, it turns out, I don't even wake up until I get knocked upside the head.
[01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:52.729]  I don't like pain until I do.
[01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:56.850]  Once the pain starts, boy, I sure like it.
[01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.949]  You know what I mean.
[01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:01.569]  I'm as happy as a pig in the shed.
[01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:06.680]  Because the tides turn globally.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.020]  And no matter what happens to me, these globalists are going down.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.560]  And I am so proud to stand with this audience of activists.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:19.100]  And I'm so proud to stand with this crew that has put up with hell.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.140]  And you know what?
[01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:20.760]  They're just like me.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.420]  They love it.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:21.800]  They do.
[01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:30.079]  They love being somewhere in a real fight, really mattering, really doing something, really changing the world for the better and getting to see it in their time.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:30.739]  That's rare.
[01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:36.949]  There's always a struggle between good versus evil in the universe.
[01:12:37.369 --> 01:12:38.470]  Always has been.
[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:45.189]  But it's rare to get to see the tide turn in your lifetime.
[01:12:45.689 --> 01:12:48.569]  And turn so dramatically at such a critical time.
[01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:49.710]  Alright, I'm going to stop there.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:13:05.239]  Because I said it would take most of this hour, and I'll have to go on to some of the next, on Trump's unbelievably important interview on NBC that came out Saturday night, got huge attention yesterday, and I watched it twice, and I've got the best clips here.
[01:13:05.399 --> 01:13:06.279]  I mean, it's all powerful.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.840]  Trump, we're going after the deep state for all their crimes, confirmed, we already knew that, but boom, that's big.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.560]  He's looking to get us out of NATO, looking to cut the funding to Ukraine, which he's already done through Speaker Johnson.
[01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:21.470]  Make America healthy again.
[01:13:21.789 --> 01:13:23.229]  Go after big pharma.
[01:13:23.949 --> 01:13:25.390]  Get the flora out of the water.
[01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:29.170]  I mean, just one of these things would be cause for celebration.
[01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:33.970]  Because when Trump says something, he's going to try to get it done.
[01:13:34.689 --> 01:13:36.630]  And you know he means it.
[01:13:38.369 --> 01:13:40.310]  And he almost always gets it done.
[01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:45.090]  Now the globalists are like, oh yeah, we're going to release a virus that's coming crashing down on you.
[01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.510]  January 21st.
[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:49.649]  That's Hotez and others.
[01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:54.930]  And oh yeah, we're going to give you World War III. And oh yeah, we're going to give you a racial uprising.
[01:13:55.149 --> 01:14:04.609]  Well, we hope that the globalists are smart enough not to continue down this road, but they're already initiating the World War III. They're already initiating all the preparatory phase for the Civil War crap.
[01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:08.369]  They're already hyping the new viruses everywhere.
[01:14:08.489 --> 01:14:09.090]  I mean, you see it.
[01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:10.149]  You don't need me to tell you about it.
[01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.890]  It's everywhere.
[01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:17.159]  And At least we're just not going to sit there taking and laying down.
[01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:18.340]  And what did COVID do?
[01:14:18.479 --> 01:14:19.100]  Blew up in their face.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.439]  Took a few years, but was there Waterloo?
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.159]  It won't take a few years now for people to reject this.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:25.760]  They'll do it.
[01:14:25.859 --> 01:14:27.319]  Day one, it's already happening.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.479]  So we're not asleep this time.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.000]  People are awake and they're pissed off and they're paying attention.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.439]  So you go ahead and pull your disease X crap.
[01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:44.140]  Disease X outbreak widens as UN sends health team to Congo.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880]  And that's the same story, Bloomberg, every year.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.479]  Oh, the U.N. needs a global treaty.
[01:14:50.579 --> 01:14:51.619]  The U.N. needs billions more.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.840]  The U.N. needs to control your life.
[01:14:53.359 --> 01:14:55.000]  The U.N. needs to control your body.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.399]  Disease X is going to kill you.
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.119]  Oh my God, all these people are dying all over the U.S. We don't know from misrealness.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:00.899]  Young people mainly.
[01:15:01.159 --> 01:15:01.859]  It's autoimmune.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:02.960]  Yeah, they took the shots.
[01:15:05.119 --> 01:15:05.939]  The numbers come out.
[01:15:06.039 --> 01:15:06.520]  Yeah, they did.
[01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:11.970]  Oh no, hundreds of vials of deadly virus missing after lab breach.
[01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:20.909]  It's thousands of articles a day, hundreds of new scares, bird flu, monkeypox, dinga, run for the hills, hemorrhagic fever, airborne, you know, Ebola.
[01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:26.470]  And then, of course, we're testing all the milk, the PCR. It's everywhere.
[01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.210]  We've got bird flu everywhere.
[01:15:28.409 --> 01:15:29.010]  We're running for the hills.
[01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:30.390]  God, kill all the cows, kill all the chickens.
[01:15:30.529 --> 01:15:31.930]  We're dead, we're dead, we're dead, we're dead!
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.720]  Hotez's eyes twinkling on MSNBC. Lots of diseases.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.479]  11 viruses.
[01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:40.920]  They're coming.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:41.720]  You can't stop it.
[01:15:41.939 --> 01:15:42.500]  It'll get you.
[01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:43.260]  It'll stop Trump.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.659]  They don't even hide it because they're desperate.
[01:15:47.619 --> 01:15:50.960]  So you go ahead and smack us upside the head with all your crises.
[01:15:51.319 --> 01:15:52.920]  See how it works out for you.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.199]  There is no doubt every one of these things is going to backfire on them.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:03.319]  Now, it might backfire on us all at the end of the world, at least civilization in a nuclear war.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.140]  So people ask, how do you take all the stress?
[01:16:09.279 --> 01:16:13.420]  How do you deal with all these attacks by the Justice Department and the CIA on record?
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:28.279]  I'm like, if I quit and ran off and lived in the woods in a cabin, and I certainly have access to that, what am I going to just wait for the collapse of civilization or nuclear war?
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.420]  I'm going to run and hide?
[01:16:32.479 --> 01:16:32.859]  No.
[01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:34.899]  I'm going to fight, and I'm going to live.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.659]  Because you can't run from this.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.640]  Oh, USDA announces a new federal order.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.479]  Begins.
[01:16:44.619 --> 01:16:48.739]  National milk testing strategy address H5N1 in dairy herds.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.659]  Oh, they just turned the PCR test and say bird flu's everywhere and it's all made up crap.
[01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.569]  They pasteurize the damn milk.
[01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:58.409]  They boil it.
[01:16:59.270 --> 01:17:01.010]  And there's not even bird flu in it.
[01:17:01.069 --> 01:17:03.689]  It's all been a fraud, but they don't care.
[01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:06.350]  Yeah, I've got the article, but I didn't see the actual FDA document.
[01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.829]  I should have got it.
[01:17:07.029 --> 01:17:07.569]  Print that for me.
[01:17:09.289 --> 01:17:11.649]  So, it's bird flu.
[01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:12.289]  That's obvious.
[01:17:12.989 --> 01:17:14.909]  Oh my God, monkeypox is going to kill everybody.
[01:17:14.949 --> 01:17:18.729]  And every one of the thousands of people that got it were eating poop.
[01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:21.270]  That's in the NIH reports.
[01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:26.399]  When they did it three years ago and again, earlier this year, they're like, it's everywhere.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.100]  It's going to kill everybody.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.279]  Keep your kids home from school.
[01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:32.779]  And then it's like, well, gay men only get this from eating feces.
[01:17:37.399 --> 01:17:39.520]  You heard me right.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.039]  And then you look at it, it's all their mouth and tongue.
[01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:53.010]  Just pull up monkey pox gay men and just images of all those pustules in their tongue and mouth because they're Doing things that are really crazy.
[01:17:55.489 --> 01:18:02.069]  And then because they want to eat poop out of somebody's ass, we have to make our kids wear a mask and take poison shots.
[01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:02.850]  See how that works?
[01:18:03.529 --> 01:18:04.590]  Because they're liberated.
[01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:08.350]  No, you go eat your poop and you can go die.
[01:18:08.869 --> 01:18:10.350]  And we're not going to eat the poop.
[01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.789]  And so we'll be just fine.
[01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:16.890]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:20.250]  Oh my God, it's so insane.
[01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:25.449]  And that's why they want us off the air, because we're just pointing out the absurdity and insanity.
[01:18:25.609 --> 01:18:27.829]  Now let me hit this before we go to break and be done with the war news.
[01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:36.770]  Then we'll come back and hit all the amazing stuff in the Trump interview and really what this means in seismic.
[01:18:37.869 --> 01:18:40.789]  So last night I get off the air at 6 p.m.
[01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:50.970]  and I go get a glass of water in the break room and CNN's on, as we like to monitor the CIA broadcasts, And they're like, Assad chemical weaponed everybody over and over again.
[01:18:51.029 --> 01:18:53.449]  He's a devil and he murdered everybody and he's terrible.
[01:18:53.770 --> 01:19:04.989]  Of course, those chemical attacks got caught at the time and mainstream news admitted that it was launched by ISIS to cross Obama's red line and get U.S. troops there, but that never happened.
[01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:07.670]  Because the Russians came in.
[01:19:08.029 --> 01:19:09.390]  Then Trump got in and stabilized it.
[01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:15.850]  And now many years later, Turkey and Israel and NATO invade with their Al-Qaeda force.
[01:19:16.979 --> 01:19:18.920]  And so they're on there saying Assad chemical weapons.
[01:19:19.039 --> 01:19:21.619]  I mean, that's provable, not true, just like WMDs in Iraq.
[01:19:22.439 --> 01:19:26.800]  And then they go, but here's the leader of the Syrian system, probably the new leader of the country.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.479]  And yeah, he's former top Al-Qaeda, the former head of Al-Qaeda in the region, like a bin Laden lookalike.
[01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.920]  But he's reformed himself as a good guy now.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:47.340]  So, Assad chemical weapon, Assad's a murderer, Assad does all this stuff, and I'm not even defending Assad, he was a hereditary dictator, but compared to Al-Qaeda, he's a sweetie pie.
[01:19:49.079 --> 01:19:58.340]  And then they show you the new Al-Qaeda, the new Bin Laden lookalike, and go, here's the good guy, and then now they're murdering all the Christians as usual and putting burkas on women's heads for beekeeping.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:06.920]  So, this is just a small clip of what I was watching, and I literally just went over to the TV, you know, the DVR, and recorded this.
[01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:07.939]  Here it is.
[01:20:09.119 --> 01:20:12.239]  Traces of Assad were being dismantled across the country.
[01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:19.979]  This statue of the man who had children gassed in a Guta basement 11 years ago, toppled in the eastern city of Tartus.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:34.279]  His image torn down from buildings in Damascus and on top of the gates of Homs city centre, symbolically where protesters tore apart his image more than a decade ago in a scene that defined the civil war's early days.
[01:20:34.939 --> 01:20:47.859]  Inspired by the seismic shifts of the Arab Spring, Syrians rose up in 2011, demanding democracy, but were met with live rounds and eventually jet planes, chemical weapons and mass executions and torture.
[01:20:48.199 --> 01:20:51.279]  Hundreds of thousands were killed, millions displaced.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:21:01.420]  As rebels swept through the capital on Sunday, images surfaced of prisoners being released from the notorious Saidenaya prison, from which so few emerged.
[01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:05.609]  Dubbed the Human Slaughterhouse by Amnesty International.
[01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:14.310]  The militant figure leading this rebel offensive is Abu Muhammad al-Jalani, seen here prostrating in prayer upon entering Damascus.
[01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:25.260]  Once affiliated with Al-Qaeda, Jalani has been suggesting he has matured from his extremist roots Though there are deep concerns about what kind of new Syria may now emerge.
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:32.920]  At one of the oldest mosques in the world in Damascus, he was received with applause and jeers as he hailed total victory.
[01:21:34.539 --> 01:21:39.239]  This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:44.420]  This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region.
[01:21:44.949 --> 01:21:46.329]  Without doubt, a new chapter.
[01:21:46.529 --> 01:21:57.609]  But with the joy of change comes anxiety at the future and surely a reckoning of sorts for the decades of horror past that could mire the hope of the days ahead.
[01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:04.130]  And then in a couple of years, we'll be there going to war with Al-Qaeda that runs the country.
[01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:05.970]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:22:06.109 --> 01:22:09.470]  That's how the West destabilizes the Middle East, just like Israel creating Hamas.
[01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:11.550]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:22:12.130 --> 01:22:13.010]  It's criminal.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:18.699]  And it needs to stop, but it's not because they're trying to hand Trump a total disaster.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.380]  Now let's go into Trump's huge interview and the amazing developments there in Policy Straight Ahead.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:23.920]  Stay with us.

[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.800]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.840]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.920]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most...

[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.720]  Alright, let's get into the big news.
[01:24:27.199 --> 01:24:31.720]  Anybody had any questions about what President Trump's going to do in 41 days?
[01:24:32.199 --> 01:24:33.859]  You can set all that aside.
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:51.399]  And everything he said in this hour-long interview with the kleptocratic Decepticon NBC as they steal the truth and try to run away with it and have failed is a...
[01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:55.649]  Confirmation of what we've already laid out Trump's going to do.
[01:24:56.829 --> 01:25:06.170]  But the first tranche of information I want to play is Trump's excellent answers on what he plans to do about tyranny.
[01:25:09.329 --> 01:25:13.109]  And he explains, I don't need a pardon from Joe Biden.
[01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:14.250]  I've done nothing wrong.
[01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:17.829]  He said, I don't want to just vindictively go after these people.
[01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:20.789]  My revenge is doing a good job in having a civilization.
[01:25:21.829 --> 01:25:23.149]  The best revenge is living well.
[01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:38.850]  But he said justice must be served, and so whether they're Democrats or Republicans, I want Kash Patel as the new FBI director and his new attorney general to go after the criminals for the human trafficking, the insider trading,
[01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:45.949]  and all the other crimes that they nakedly, openly, prima facie, committed.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.920]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.039]  So, let's start.
[01:26:05.579 --> 01:26:10.500]  Let's start with President Trump.
[01:26:13.199 --> 01:26:26.460]  Clip 19. My retribution will be through success.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.180]  Here it is.
[01:26:27.579 --> 01:26:30.020]  I'm really looking to make our country successful.
[01:26:30.279 --> 01:26:32.479]  I'm not looking to go back into the past.
[01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:34.319]  I'm looking to make our country successful.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.399]  Retribution will be through success.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:45.119]  If we can make this country successful, that would be my greatest That would be such a great achievement.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:45.920]  Bring it back.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:55.239]  We have a country now that's overridden with crime, that has millions of people that shouldn't be here, that should be in prisons in other countries, that should be in mental institutions.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.739]  We have drug lords being dropped into our country and told never go back to their country.
[01:27:00.079 --> 01:27:02.000]  I'm looking to make our country great.
[01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:03.720]  I'm looking to bring prices down.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.739]  Because you know, I want on two things, the border.
[01:27:07.739 --> 01:27:10.439]  And more than immigration, they like to say immigration.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.079]  I break it down more to the border, but I went on the border and I went on groceries.
[01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:17.100]  It's a very simple word, groceries.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.359]  Now, let's get into Trump.
[01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:46.529]  On a host of issues dealing with law and order and justice and his plans, play 23, 24, 20,
[01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:47.689]  and 21 back-to-back.
[01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:48.170]  Here they are.
[01:27:48.609 --> 01:27:53.069]  I asked you last time we sat down for an interview if you were gonna pardon yourself.
[01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:53.890]  You said no.
[01:27:54.250 --> 01:28:00.189]  But now that President Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter, are you reconsidering?
[01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:01.350]  Might you pardon yourself?
[01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:04.130]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.449]  I was given the option.
[01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:18.760]  And the lawyers told me, very specific, I don't have to go into who, but very high up in the administration said, Sir, if you pardon yourself, you're gonna look guilty.
[01:28:19.039 --> 01:28:20.420]  And you did nothing wrong.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.920]  Oh, I had that option.
[01:28:22.159 --> 01:28:24.319]  I could have saved myself a lot of legal fees.
[01:28:24.779 --> 01:28:26.479]  But it turned out that I was right.
[01:28:27.039 --> 01:28:28.239]  Look at what's going on.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.359]  Everything's being dropped.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.619]  I still have a Fonny Willis, a total hoax.
[01:28:34.739 --> 01:28:35.640]  That's a total hoax.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:37.119]  It's all being dropped.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.520]  Pam Bondi talks about investigating the investigators.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.760]  Do you want her to investigate Jack Smith?
[01:28:42.779 --> 01:28:44.119]  I want her to do what she wants to do.
[01:28:44.279 --> 01:28:45.539]  Do you want to see Jack Smith investigate?
[01:28:45.539 --> 01:28:49.039]  Well, I think he's very corrupt, but I want her to do whatever she has to do.
[01:28:49.039 --> 01:28:50.880]  Are you going to direct her to prosecute Jack Smith?
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:50.960]  No, I'm not.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:52.420]  She's a very smart person.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.300]  She was a great attorney general in Florida.
[01:28:55.399 --> 01:28:56.539]  She's very experienced.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.380]  I want her to do what she wants to do.
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.880]  I'm not going to instruct her to do it, no.
[01:29:00.039 --> 01:29:03.720]  Are you going to fire the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, who you appointed?
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.060]  Well, I can't say I'm thrilled with him.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.119]  He invaded my home.
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.899]  I'm suing the country over it.
[01:29:11.039 --> 01:29:13.100]  He invaded Mar-a-Lago.
[01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:17.829]  I'm very unhappy with the things he's done.
[01:29:18.029 --> 01:29:20.369]  And crime is at an all-time high.
[01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:26.409]  Migrants are pouring into the country that are from prisons and from mental institutions, as we've discussed.
[01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:28.350]  I can't say I'm thrilled.
[01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:34.510]  I don't wanna say, I don't wanna, again, I don't wanna be Joe Biden and give you an answer and then do the exact opposite.
[01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:35.170]  We're gonna talk about that.
[01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:36.270]  So I'm not gonna do that.
[01:29:37.079 --> 01:29:40.000]  What I'm going to say is I certainly cannot be happy with him.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.960]  You take a look at what's happened.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.819]  And then when I was shot in the ear, he said, oh, maybe it was shrapnel.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.239]  Where's the shrapnel coming from?
[01:29:48.359 --> 01:29:50.520]  Is it coming from heaven?
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.520]  I don't think so.
[01:29:53.710 --> 01:29:55.670]  We need somebody to straighten up.
[01:29:55.869 --> 01:30:02.369]  You know, I have a lot of respect for the FBI, but the FBI's respect has gone way down over the last number of years.
[01:30:02.449 --> 01:30:06.890]  Don't you have to fire him in order to make room for Cash Patel if he is, in fact, confirmed?
[01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:12.489]  Well, I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious that if Cash gets in, he's gonna be taking somebody's place, right?
[01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:14.409]  Somebody is the man that you're talking about.
[01:30:14.529 --> 01:30:15.529]  Some of this new reporting.
[01:30:15.739 --> 01:30:23.600]  NBC News is reporting that President Biden is considering giving preemptive pardons to the likes of Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff, and Anthony Fauci.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.600]  If President Biden doesn't issue those pardons, do you think they are going to wish that he had?
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:29.939]  I don't know.
[01:30:29.939 --> 01:30:33.479]  I can tell you this about Cheney, and she's a so-called Republican.
[01:30:33.979 --> 01:30:36.119]  I think she hurt the Democrats terribly.
[01:30:36.359 --> 01:30:54.079]  When I saw that Kamala We're good to go.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.979]  They deleted and destroyed all evidence that they found.
[01:31:06.279 --> 01:31:07.279]  You know why?
[01:31:07.539 --> 01:31:09.560]  Because Nancy Pelosi was guilty.
[01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:13.250]  Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 troops.
[01:31:13.369 --> 01:31:16.590]  You wouldn't have had a J6 because other people were guilty.
[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:22.189]  The people that said that I attacked two Secret Service agents in a car.
[01:31:22.369 --> 01:31:24.210]  I grabbed one around their neck.
[01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:26.609]  I was then rebuffed, and I grabbed the other one.
[01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:29.590]  These are two of the toughest men anywhere on the planet.
[01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:32.510]  They happen to be slightly younger than me.
[01:31:32.630 --> 01:31:33.649]  You know, just a little bit.
[01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:34.689]  Let me just tell you.
[01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:36.430]  They testified.
[01:31:37.029 --> 01:31:38.649]  They said it was total...
[01:31:40.399 --> 01:31:42.119]  And all of this stuff came out.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:43.979]  People lied so badly.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.460]  Now, listen.
[01:31:47.039 --> 01:31:48.279]  This was a committee.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.720]  A big deal.
[01:31:50.699 --> 01:31:52.039]  They lied.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.279]  And what did they do?
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:58.100]  They deleted and destroyed a whole year and a half worth of testimony.
[01:31:58.739 --> 01:32:00.060]  Do you know that I can't get...
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.180]  I think those people committed a major crime.
[01:32:02.439 --> 01:32:04.079]  And Cheney was behind it.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.359]  And so was Benny Thompson.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.220]  And everybody on that committee...
[01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:12.369]  For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.
[01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.430]  So you think Liz Cheney should go to jail?
[01:32:17.289 --> 01:32:19.289]  Everyone on the committee you think should be in jail?
[01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:24.170]  Are you going to direct your FBI director and your attorney general to send them to jail?
[01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.750]  No, not at all.
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:27.670]  I think that they'll have to look at that, but I'm not going to...
[01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:29.909]  I'm going to focus on drill, baby, drill.
[01:32:29.989 --> 01:32:31.869]  When you say that, it carries weight, though.
[01:32:32.369 --> 01:32:37.369]  You've tapped these people to lead the Justice Department and FBI. They can do whatever they want.
[01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:41.670]  Biden can give him a pardon if he wants to, and maybe he should.
[01:32:42.289 --> 01:32:44.979]  Just remember, Unselect committee.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.359]  A year and a half of sworn testimony.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:52.039]  And after getting all of the testimony, they deleted it.
[01:32:52.279 --> 01:32:52.880]  Wait.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.359]  And they destroyed almost everything.
[01:32:56.819 --> 01:32:58.520]  There's nothing left.
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:00.439]  It's unprecedented.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.800]  And they deny doing that.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.439]  If you do that in a civil case, you go to jail.
[01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:06.100]  You know they deny doing that.
[01:33:06.359 --> 01:33:10.079]  And officials say that the order never came in for the National Guard.
[01:33:10.659 --> 01:33:10.699]  They put out a statement.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.520]  On January 6th.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:12.880]  Let me ask you this about January 6th.
[01:33:12.979 --> 01:33:17.020]  Benny Thompson wrote in a statement that he has destroyed all evidence.
[01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:19.399]  Let me ask you this about January 6th.
[01:33:19.579 --> 01:33:20.739]  I wish you could be a...
[01:33:20.739 --> 01:33:23.039]  You know, you have such potential.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.920]  If you could be just non-biased, You hurt yourself so badly.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:34.100]  I'm telling you, they deleted and destroyed all the evidence.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.000]  Everyone knows it.
[01:33:35.479 --> 01:33:37.739]  And you slough it off like it doesn't mean anything.
[01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.399]  No, I'm just saying they deny it.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.119]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:44.979]  Listen, if I did it, you would be standing up in that chair shouting at me.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:45.840]  And you know what I'd do?
[01:33:46.289 --> 01:33:48.029]  I'd say, you got me.
[01:33:48.909 --> 01:33:51.729]  They have done something so illegal.
[01:33:51.989 --> 01:34:01.569]  They have a committee sworn to, and because it was so bad, the only reason they did it is because the testimony turned out to be in favor of me.
[01:34:02.130 --> 01:34:06.510]  Like, Secret Service testified and disputed everything.
[01:34:06.689 --> 01:34:08.869]  It made them into a bunch of liars.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:10.909]  Not Secret Service, it made the people.
[01:34:11.539 --> 01:34:18.859]  They got rid of it because it made Nancy Pelosi, the mayor of DC, so many people look like criminals.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:24.600]  And I will tell you, it's illegal for them to delete and to destroy that evidence.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.119]  All right, so that is so incredible.
[01:34:28.319 --> 01:34:31.699]  I mean, I can take that last six minutes of clips and just analyze it for a whole hour.
[01:34:32.659 --> 01:34:36.460]  She's trying to set him up that he's directing them to grab people criminally.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.539]  No, but he says they obviously committed crimes.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:46.000]  They destroyed the interviews, the videotapes, all of their January 6th investigation.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.739]  They destroyed it because they were covering up what they did.
[01:34:49.119 --> 01:34:53.359]  They interviewed me and hundreds of other people under oath in Congress.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.500]  They destroyed it.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.239]  They destroyed it.
[01:35:02.359 --> 01:35:03.420]  It wasn't a real committee.
[01:35:03.659 --> 01:35:06.300]  The law says it's got to be voted on by Republicans and Democrats.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.680]  The Republicans can put their members on.
[01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:08.680]  They didn't.
[01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:13.460]  They put Kinzinger and Cheney and others on there.
[01:35:13.539 --> 01:35:14.279]  It's a joke.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.220]  And then she got caught illegally talking to witnesses on a private email and text messages.
[01:35:19.539 --> 01:35:23.159]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:27.300]  It was a political hit job rolled into a cover-up.
[01:35:29.199 --> 01:35:31.159]  And she's wildly unpopular.
[01:35:32.449 --> 01:35:34.449]  It's the most unpopular Republican in modern history.
[01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:39.430]  And this is who the Democrats thought, oh, we're with Dick Cheney's daughter.
[01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.090]  We're with Darth Vader's daughter.
[01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:43.149]  They thought everybody would, oh, that's a wonderful idea.
[01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:51.630]  So, and you heard him in the other clip, you know, we're going to be going after anybody, Republicans, Democrats, anybody that's corrupt.
[01:35:52.609 --> 01:35:54.029]  These are smart people I put in.
[01:35:54.909 --> 01:35:56.810]  They can do whatever they think's right under the law.
[01:35:58.050 --> 01:35:59.989]  But there he is saying they're criminals.
[01:35:59.989 --> 01:36:01.229]  I think they should be gone after.
[01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.869]  And he's a citizen.
[01:36:01.869 --> 01:36:02.489]  He's a victim.
[01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:06.569]  It's like I put in my lawsuit and our court filings, multiple lawsuits.
[01:36:07.489 --> 01:36:09.970]  And folks that really won the bid put in their lawsuit.
[01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:11.069]  Hey, we believe this is criminal.
[01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:12.229]  Violates this code, that code.
[01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.829]  Here's where they did it.
[01:36:12.949 --> 01:36:15.489]  And now we've deposed the people except the owner of the onion.
[01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:16.270]  He refused.
[01:36:16.369 --> 01:36:17.010]  Even the judge ordered it.
[01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:18.109]  Well, that'll be some fireworks.
[01:36:18.329 --> 01:36:19.409]  The hearing's going on right now.
[01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:22.630]  They just thought they could do whatever they wanted to.
[01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:23.569]  And maybe they can.
[01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:24.170]  I don't know.
[01:36:24.329 --> 01:36:26.689]  But I know that this is injustice.
[01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:29.949]  I know that I'm not going along with it.
[01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:31.829]  I know the court of public opinion, they're convicted.
[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:34.489]  And so, yeah, I think they should be indicted.
[01:36:34.829 --> 01:36:35.489]  I've said that.
[01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:37.850]  And they can't just run around and do all this stuff.
[01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:38.810]  It's clear bid rigging.
[01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:42.510]  It's clear that it's price fixing.
[01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:43.949]  Those are federal crimes.
[01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:47.149]  And they did it in their own documents.
[01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.850]  And now we've deposed a bunch of them.
[01:36:48.909 --> 01:36:51.409]  And they're just sitting there admitting it.
[01:36:51.489 --> 01:36:52.649]  Like, well, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:53.329]  We can do whatever we want.
[01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:57.390]  You know, this is what the law firms, the Democrats control, wanted.
[01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:03.130]  Oh, so you talk to them, you did all this, went back and forth constantly, and oh my God, this other bit's bigger, you better go higher.
[01:37:03.289 --> 01:37:04.550]  You're not supposed to tell them that.
[01:37:05.989 --> 01:37:09.789]  I mean, it's wild.
[01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:14.770]  So, here he is, Trump, on Kash Patel.
[01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:16.609]  Listen to this.
[01:37:18.159 --> 01:37:24.920]  If they think that somebody was dishonest or crooked or a corrupt politician, I think he probably has an obligation to do it.
[01:37:25.279 --> 01:37:26.680]  But- Are you gonna direct him to do it?
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.460]  No, not at all.
[01:37:27.659 --> 01:37:28.260]  Not at all.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.520]  We have two great people there.
[01:37:29.619 --> 01:37:31.119]  We have him and we have Pam.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.239]  And Pam Bondi has been like a rocket ship.
[01:37:34.359 --> 01:37:36.899]  She's very popular and very good and very fair.
[01:37:37.479 --> 01:37:38.579]  And Cash Patella's very fair.
[01:37:38.659 --> 01:37:45.000]  I'll tell you, I thought Cash may be difficult because he's a strong conservative voice.
[01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:49.060]  And I don't know of anybody that's not singing his praises.
[01:37:49.199 --> 01:37:58.420]  The other day I was watching and Trey Gowdy, who's a moderate person and very smart and very respected in the party, he's Cash's biggest fan.
[01:37:58.619 --> 01:38:02.359]  He said this is the most misunderstood man in politics.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.319]  He's great.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.100]  I guess they worked together on the Russia hoax or something.
[01:38:08.439 --> 01:38:14.439]  Now, let's play a clip of Tom Cotton on Fox News this morning.
[01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.090]  At least that's when they replayed the club.
[01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:19.090]  Because I grabbed it.
[01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:21.489]  And here he is.
[01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:25.229]  NATO is taking advantage of the United States.
[01:38:26.329 --> 01:38:29.369]  Trump is going to get all his appointments done.
[01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:41.699]  Tom Cotton doesn't say things To make them come true, he says things authoritatively when he knows they've got the votes, and he's one of the leaders in the Senate.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:50.520]  And so this is a big, big statement of the establishment Republicans are bending the knee to Trump.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.420]  He has the mandate.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.659]  He has the landslide.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.500]  He is beyond a rock star worldwide.
[01:38:57.619 --> 01:38:59.000]  This is exciting.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:38:59.539]  Here it is.
[01:39:00.569 --> 01:39:11.069]  Real quick, Pete Hegseth seems to have gotten momentum behind him, but you're in Washington, you talk to these senators, you go to lunch in the cafeteria together, so is he on track?
[01:39:11.069 --> 01:39:12.010]  Is he gaining momentum?
[01:39:14.729 --> 01:39:20.029]  Brian, I expect a Republican Senate is going to confirm all of a Republican president-elect's nominees.
[01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:23.229]  I had a good meeting last week with Pete Hegseth and with Pam Bondi.
[01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:24.710]  I know many of these nominees.
[01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:27.210]  Two Arkansans have been nominated as ambassadors.
[01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:30.770]  Marco Rubio, Kelly Loeffler, Doug Collins, and I served together.
[01:39:31.069 --> 01:39:42.229]  In fact, if you go back 32 years to Bill Clinton's transition, there are only two nominees out of 72 cabinet secretary nominees in which senators of the president-elect's party voted against them.
[01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:50.010]  So no one should be surprised That a Republican Senate is going to confirm the Republican president-elect's cabinet secretaries.
[01:39:54.789 --> 01:39:57.810]  The Duke of New York is a number one.
[01:39:57.989 --> 01:39:58.529]  Say it!
[01:39:59.390 --> 01:40:02.489]  The Duke of New York is a number one!
[01:40:06.409 --> 01:40:09.649]  And we're not talking about the Duke of New York from Escape from New York.
[01:40:10.949 --> 01:40:13.329]  We're talking about the real Duke of New York.
[01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:19.670]  DJ T. Good times!
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:44.539]  Here it comes.
[01:40:46.279 --> 01:40:48.180]  Oh, that's actually Biden's plane.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.920]  That's the New World Order's plane.
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.300]  And a little escape pod right into hell.
[01:41:07.170 --> 01:41:08.729]  Through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[01:41:08.949 --> 01:41:09.609]  to 3 p.m.
[01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:13.930]  Central, I'm here, live on air, from Central Texas, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:25.890]  And no matter what happens in federal court today, I'm going to be on air tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:41:26.069 --> 01:41:28.890]  Central, whether it's from the Infowars studios or not.
[01:41:29.729 --> 01:41:32.909]  And the rest is up to you.
[01:41:37.289 --> 01:41:42.109]  In the information war, where to find the verboten transmission?
[01:41:43.369 --> 01:41:45.810]  The tyrants don't want you to.
[01:41:46.289 --> 01:41:50.409]  And it'd be a terrible thing for their agenda.
[01:41:57.729 --> 01:41:59.970]  Like a leprechaun dancing on their political grave.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.359]  Oh, finally.
[01:42:15.899 --> 01:42:18.420]  George Strait's come out and done the Trump dance.
[01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:19.520]  Good.
[01:42:20.399 --> 01:42:21.039]  Good.
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:23.939]  Good, Anakin.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:24.579]  Good.
[01:42:28.159 --> 01:42:31.119]  Wonder how old Bill Gates is feeling right now.
[01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:43.689]  Every single globalist is now an enemy of the republic.
[01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:47.569]  All right.
[01:42:48.409 --> 01:42:49.329]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:42:49.569 --> 01:42:52.250]  We're gonna start the third hour.
[01:42:52.369 --> 01:42:55.069]  Got a huge guest looking at the wars and more.
[01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:57.630]  And that's the big enchilada.
[01:42:57.770 --> 01:43:02.829]  Though we're winning politically, culturally, spiritually, New World Order has put some serious stuff into motion.
[01:43:02.949 --> 01:43:04.149]  You heard General Flynn last hour.
[01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:07.930]  If you missed it, it's just gone up on X. World War III is here.
[01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:13.510]  We are living in World War III. And the globalists are just exploding war and civil war everywhere.
[01:43:13.569 --> 01:43:14.390]  They're planning it here.
[01:43:14.869 --> 01:43:18.409]  But we have the public.
[01:43:19.569 --> 01:43:21.989]  All the top shows in the world are anti-globalist.
[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:23.350]  Populists are winning everywhere.
[01:43:23.489 --> 01:43:27.189]  So NATO goes, oh, Romania and anti-globalists got elected.
[01:43:28.909 --> 01:43:32.489]  We're just canceling your election, NATO said, hoping Russia comes in.
[01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:34.250]  This is serious.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:38.079]  I'll get into that and more next hour.
[01:43:38.279 --> 01:43:46.699]  Please remember, when you do your Christmas shopping at the Alex Jones store.com, no matter what happens to InfoWars or the studio, I don't own that.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.779]  The bad guys can't get it.
[01:43:47.859 --> 01:43:50.079]  It's our sponsor for the Alex Jones Network and more.
[01:43:50.439 --> 01:43:52.699]  Also, InfoWars, I think we're going to win.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.960]  Good guys will get InfoWars.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:54.640]  I'll work for them.
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.279]  But regardless, we just keep fighting.
[01:43:56.359 --> 01:43:57.079]  We've got our options.
[01:43:57.199 --> 01:43:57.760]  That's what we do.
[01:43:58.319 --> 01:44:00.539]  We don't just sit here and hope this continues on.
[01:44:00.659 --> 01:44:01.420]  We build other things.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:07.159]  Busy beavers and I know you're busy, Beavers.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.840]  So, the silver coins sold out.
[01:44:11.039 --> 01:44:14.840]  It was only 2,000, but like 500 hadn't come in yet.
[01:44:14.859 --> 01:44:15.659]  They come in next week.
[01:44:16.119 --> 01:44:17.779]  So those are pre-order now.
[01:44:18.039 --> 01:44:21.060]  Same thing with the Trump on a stump that's so popular.
[01:44:21.159 --> 01:44:22.760]  Everybody that ordered it, it's in stock, you'll get it.
[01:44:23.159 --> 01:44:25.819]  But if you pre-order it now and they come in the 23rd, you'll get it.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.739]  And it's something you want year-round.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:27.479]  It's super fun.
[01:44:27.819 --> 01:44:29.060]  Like Elf on a Shelf and it's Trump.
[01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:31.140]  But what is in stock is everything else on the side.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.539]  If something's not in stock, it'll have that big yellow message there.
[01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:39.710]  It's only the collectible silver coins limited edition and the Trump on a stump elf that is not available.
[01:44:39.829 --> 01:44:40.770]  Everything else is like this.
[01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:45.930]  The Alex Jones 2025 calendar that the great folks at Bigley designed.
[01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:48.329]  This is a lot of fun for your office or home.
[01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:49.609]  It is amazing.
[01:44:50.329 --> 01:44:53.510]  You need to go check out all of the stuff that's in it.
[01:44:54.539 --> 01:44:59.060]  And also there is a limited edition 2024 election victory ornament.
[01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:02.300]  It'll be good year after year after year.
[01:45:02.539 --> 01:45:03.399]  That's there.
[01:45:03.539 --> 01:45:09.060]  And there's two great new supplements that just came in that are private labels of...
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.000]  Top-selling national highest-rated brands.
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.579]  The great folks have been able to private label, so they're already the very best.
[01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:17.680]  The strongest, best turmeric.
[01:45:17.939 --> 01:45:24.020]  So good for your whole body with ginger root and black pepper concentrate for your inflammation, for your immune system, for your overall health.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:24.840]  It is incredible.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.939]  Everybody knows turmeric's great.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.100]  Well, this is the best you're going to get, and it funds the InfoWare.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:28.800]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:29.819]  That's 360 win.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:47.000]  We're good to go.
[01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:50.170]  That's all discounted.

[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:46:37.619 --> 01:46:39.479]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:46:39.859 --> 01:46:45.960]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:46:46.159 --> 01:46:49.260]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.

[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:55.199]  What did the United Nations have to do with the border crisis?
[01:46:55.359 --> 01:46:56.960]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:46:57.069 --> 01:47:27.229]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border again by design and so much more is happening this is an exciting time but the globalists are striking back that's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever and we can't do it without you so we make it easy go to thealexshownstore.com and get the most amazing widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word to meet like-minded people and support the info war now The folks at Bigly that power

[01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:50.850]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fearing, walking on the street, saying, it's okay.
[01:47:51.289 --> 01:47:55.949]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.

[01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:33.710]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:50:33.869 --> 01:50:36.069]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:50:37.909 --> 01:50:43.189]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:10.939]  The entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[01:51:13.159 --> 01:51:14.760]  You know you're in a war, right?
[01:51:15.399 --> 01:51:16.819]  And it's a declared war.
[01:51:16.899 --> 01:51:18.819]  The globalists have declared war on team humanity.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.220]  They've declared war on the God that made us.
[01:51:22.039 --> 01:51:23.640]  It is not incredible.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.859]  It is not heroic.
[01:51:25.119 --> 01:51:27.300]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[01:51:27.479 --> 01:51:28.760]  It is survival.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.060]  This is the priority.
[01:51:32.619 --> 01:51:34.039]  This is the real world.
[01:51:34.119 --> 01:51:34.920]  This is game time.
[01:51:35.119 --> 01:51:37.399]  This is the crossroads of human destiny right now.
[01:51:37.779 --> 01:51:38.199]  Right now.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:43.800]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.020]  We need maximum urgency.
[01:51:46.439 --> 01:51:49.359]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen.
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:50.699]  Don't you understand that?
[01:51:51.619 --> 01:51:53.600]  I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.579]  I want you to kill with truth.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.140]  Kill with your will.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:57.880]  Kill!
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:58.439]  Kill!
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.859]  Kill their lies!
[01:52:13.699 --> 01:52:16.800]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[01:52:22.439 --> 01:52:24.520]  I can feel human liberty exploding.
[01:52:24.939 --> 01:52:27.420]  I can feel your will.
[01:52:30.899 --> 01:52:33.560]  Evil is in full panic mode right now.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.079]  God is real.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.659]  God is great.
[01:52:38.119 --> 01:52:41.479]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:46.319]  And I want all of you to hear me now.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:54.529]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically, Has just begun.
[01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:07.630]  And it is your choice, spiritually now, which side you're going to be on, that will predestine your entire future throughout the universe.
[01:53:08.609 --> 01:53:10.369]  Earth is only the launch point.
[01:53:11.649 --> 01:53:13.170]  The eye has not seen.
[01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:16.130]  The ear has not heard.
[01:53:16.369 --> 01:53:19.050]  The mind has not seen.
[01:53:19.409 --> 01:53:20.890]  It's what God has in store for us.
[01:53:22.409 --> 01:53:23.289]  You can feel it.
[01:53:23.949 --> 01:53:24.789]  You can see it.
[01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.989]  You can touch it.
[01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:26.829]  You can taste it.
[01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.289]  You know it in your very bones.
[01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:31.069]  The heart of your soul.
[01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:37.289]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead God and direct you.
[01:53:37.789 --> 01:53:39.609]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:41.750]  Ask God to purify you.
[01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:45.369]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[01:53:45.850 --> 01:53:54.949]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little G God of this world.
[01:53:59.029 --> 01:54:02.449]  In such an incredibly historical time right now.
[01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:07.750]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls.
[01:54:08.329 --> 01:54:16.750]  But it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.
[01:54:30.670 --> 01:54:34.890]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.979]  We have only begun to fight, New World Order.
[01:55:09.439 --> 01:55:10.779]  And we're coming for you.
[01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:19.189]  We're now into hour number three.
[01:55:19.369 --> 01:55:21.149]  It's 106 Central Standard Time.
[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:30.670]  We're simulcasting on over 450 radio stations, many cable and TV stations, and blasting out at Real Alex Jones on X and at AJN Live.
[01:55:30.989 --> 01:55:32.329]  Be sure and follow us there.
[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:34.090]  And so many other places.
[01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:35.949]  Infowars could be shut down by tonight.
[01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:38.989]  There's a federal investigation hearing of...
[01:55:39.829 --> 01:55:54.489]  The U.S. trustee and the Democrats and the law firms and the whole Bloomberg operation with The Onion and their Everytown gun confiscation victim disarmament group in Houston, Texas right now in Judge Chris Lopez's chambers and in his courtroom.
[01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:58.609]  And I was not on the witness list.
[01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:59.829]  The bad guys didn't want me there.
[01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:01.810]  So my lawyers are like, well, we already have all the documents.
[01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:02.810]  We have all the stuff.
[01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.390]  You're not really needed there.
[01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:05.329]  I was planning to be there.
[01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:09.250]  And so I'm not there because I wasn't needed.
[01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:11.010]  And we're here.
[01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:13.670]  And I would like to stay in these studios.
[01:56:13.689 --> 01:56:16.710]  I would like to continue on.
[01:56:16.829 --> 01:56:18.229]  We've been here 16 years in these studios.
[01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:19.229]  Been on here 30 plus years.
[01:56:19.369 --> 01:56:23.250]  But we already have backup studios and a bigger one getting built.
[01:56:23.949 --> 01:56:25.489]  And it's not owned by me.
[01:56:25.989 --> 01:56:28.829]  It's like the AlexJonesStore.com is it that funds a lot of it.
[01:56:29.250 --> 01:56:31.569]  And so they've already made their promises to come after that.
[01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:32.029]  Well, good.
[01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.590]  Good for you.
[01:56:33.659 --> 01:56:35.760]  Good for you, because you won't shut down anything.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:52.340]  And the fact you keep trying to shut us down creates a Streisand effect, and people want to tune in and hear what is this thing that they've had tens of thousands and tens of thousands and tens of thousands of articles demonizing me, thousands of TV programs, movies, shows, HBO, fake documentaries, rigged show trials.
[01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:56.319]  Wow, what do they not want people to hear or see?
[01:56:57.939 --> 01:57:02.699]  They don't want to hear General Flynn, the former head of Defense Intelligence Agency, telling you World War III is now here.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:14.739]  We're in World War III. The crazy Biden administration is starting all these wars and overthrowing Syria using Al-Qaeda, joined up with Israel and Turkey.
[01:57:16.199 --> 01:57:22.619]  They don't want this broadcast exposing what the establishment is doing.
[01:57:25.319 --> 01:57:29.880]  And it's so naked and ridiculous.
[01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:38.520]  I mean, I remember when this stuff in Syria, after 13 years of the global trying to overthrow it, started about eight days ago.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.640]  And I'm at the gym at 7 a.m.
[01:57:42.739 --> 01:57:47.779]  literally doing exercises and I had a bunch of different people come over.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.539]  And they're asking me, well, what's going on in Syria?
[01:57:52.619 --> 01:57:54.479]  And I said, and it just started.
[01:57:54.619 --> 01:58:00.439]  And I said, that's just NATO and Turkey and Israel, like it always is, trying to break it up and carve it up into little pieces.
[01:58:01.439 --> 01:58:04.779]  And we're like, well, the news says that they don't know what's going on.
[01:58:04.859 --> 01:58:06.079]  I said, well, that's the corporate news.
[01:58:06.239 --> 01:58:07.619]  I mean, you can go look at the names of the groups.
[01:58:07.699 --> 01:58:11.880]  I said, I pulled my phone up, and I'm leader of the Syrian rebels.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.539]  I go, here he is.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.960]  He's the former regional leader of Al-Qaeda.
[01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:22.210]  And here's an article where Israel admits they're funding them.
[01:58:22.529 --> 01:58:24.369]  And here's Turkey from the north.
[01:58:25.869 --> 01:58:28.310]  And they're like, wow, wow, I didn't know that.
[01:58:28.369 --> 01:58:28.930]  I'm like, yeah.
[01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:34.510]  And the guy's like, well, you know, I'm former military myself and, you know, run an analytics company.
[01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:35.789]  So I have people that are over there.
[01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:37.930]  I'm just like, okay, great.
[01:58:38.649 --> 01:58:41.229]  I mean, it's just, you know, how hard is this stuff to figure out?
[01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:58.170]  So now we've had Erdogan of Turkey, and we've had Netanyahu, you know, two days ago and again today, and Israel's moving in, taking over part of southern Syria, and Turkey's saying they're going to take part of northern Syria, and they've taken credit for it.
[01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:59.289]  Yeah, we were behind it.
[01:58:59.390 --> 01:59:00.149]  Yeah, we did it.
[01:59:00.989 --> 01:59:03.409]  And Biden's taking credit, and it's disgusting.
[01:59:03.949 --> 01:59:20.060]  When you hear, oh, B-52s are bombing ISIS. And so even the Washington Post says, yeah, the Pentagon's funding this group of rebels, the CIA's funding that other group,
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:22.560]  and what they're doing is just destroying the country.
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:24.840]  And then they'll have another war.
[01:59:25.979 --> 01:59:29.340]  They already have it with that group down the road.
[01:59:29.699 --> 01:59:34.840]  And the goal is just de-industrialize and further destroy and starve everybody to death in Syria.
[01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:38.430]  And then they can turn around and say, oh, look, they're starving to death.
[01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:39.390]  Hundreds of thousands of dead.
[01:59:39.609 --> 01:59:40.289]  Assad killed them.
[01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:41.770]  No, the West attacked them.
[01:59:41.909 --> 01:59:55.949]  And Qaddafi in 2008, I have the clip coming up, put it on excellent, Alex Jones, at the Arab League, told all of them, they said, you guys need to stick together because they're going to pick us all off one after the other, just like General Wesley Clark famously said.
[01:59:56.029 --> 01:59:56.949]  We have that clip coming up.
[01:59:58.449 --> 01:59:59.890]  And they laughed at Qaddafi.
[02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:03.369]  Well, they're not laughing now.
[02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:12.149]  And so we're going to be going over all of this with a special guest for The Balance of the Hour and all the clips I just mentioned.
[02:00:12.449 --> 02:00:17.409]  But I don't normally play a clip twice on a show, but this is CNN last night.
[02:00:17.529 --> 02:00:18.930]  They were repeating the same thing over and over again today.
[02:00:20.329 --> 02:00:22.250]  Over and over again, Assad gassed the people.
[02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:23.829]  Assad killed 200,000 people.
[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:25.810]  It was on record.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.020]  Even mainstream media had to admit back then, okay, Assad didn't cross the red line.
[02:00:31.079 --> 02:00:32.340]  He didn't use this chlorine gas.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:34.500]  It was ISIS. It was Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.000]  Because they wanted to get the bonus money when they go, you know, dirka dirka and all that and fire it.
[02:00:39.359 --> 02:00:41.760]  So they were like, we are with this group in Arabic.
[02:00:41.779 --> 02:00:43.420]  And then they'd fire the mortars.
[02:00:44.539 --> 02:00:47.619]  And the CIA's like, damn it, you're not supposed to say you did it.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.600]  And some people really did get gas.
[02:00:51.699 --> 02:00:54.060]  They also had crisis actors that they got caught.
[02:00:54.199 --> 02:00:55.800]  I mean, mainstream media admitted this.
[02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:58.189]  You're not supposed to talk about that.
[02:01:00.449 --> 02:01:11.289]  And so last night, I'm sitting there after the show, and CNN goes, well, this guy was the leader of Al-Qaeda, but he's a good person now, and there are some concerns, though.
[02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:13.470]  So let's start with this.
[02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:17.350]  Let's start with just a minute now.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:21.560]  And 50 seconds from CNN, here it is.
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:25.439]  ...traces of Assad were being dismantled across the country.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:33.159]  This statue of the man who had children gassed in a Guta basement 11 years ago, toppled in the eastern city of Tartus.
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:47.460]  His image torn down from buildings in Damascus and on top of the gates of Homs city center, symbolically where protesters tore apart his image more than a decade ago in a scene that defined the civil war's early days.
[02:01:48.119 --> 02:02:01.039]  Inspired by the seismic shifts of the Arab Spring, Syrians rose up in 2011 demanding democracy, but were met with live rounds and eventually jet planes, chemical weapons and mass executions and torture.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.439]  Hundreds of thousands were killed, millions displaced.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:14.600]  As rebels swept through the capital on Sunday, images surfaced of prisoners being released from the notorious Seydnaya prison, from which so few emerged.
[02:02:15.359 --> 02:02:18.760]  Dubbed the Human Slaughterhouse by Amnesty International.
[02:02:19.159 --> 02:02:27.500]  The militant figure leading this rebel offensive is Abu Muhammad al-Jalani, seen here prostrating in prayer upon entering Damascus.
[02:02:27.779 --> 02:02:38.460]  Once affiliated with Al-Qaeda, Jalani has been suggesting he has matured from his extremist roots, though there are deep concerns about what kind of new Syria may now emerge.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:46.109]  At one of the oldest mosques in the world in Damascus, he was received with applause and jeers As he hailed total victory.
[02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:52.430]  This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation.
[02:02:52.649 --> 02:02:57.609]  This new triumph, my brothers, marks a new chapter in the history of the region.
[02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:10.789]  Without doubt a new chapter, but with the joy of change comes anxiety at the future and surely a reckoning of sorts for the decades of horror past that could mire the hope of the days ahead.
[02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:15.510]  All right, Syrian girl's been coming on the show.
[02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:19.909]  It's got to be for 13, 14, 15 years since this whole attempt to overthrow Syria began.
[02:03:20.250 --> 02:03:27.229]  She herself and her family are exiles from Syria by the Assad regime previously, but she's not been for his overthrow, knowing it would be something far worse.
[02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:28.550]  I'm recapping what she said many times.
[02:03:28.649 --> 02:03:29.590]  They're not putting words in her mouth.
[02:03:30.010 --> 02:03:36.710]  And she is at Syrian Girl Partisan on YouTube and Syrian Girl on Telegram on X at Partisan Girl.
[02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:48.100]  Syrian Girl Maram Suseli, I always pronounce it wrong, is a journalist covering geopolitics and the war in Syria.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.960]  She's currently working for a Middle East publication.
[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:57.340]  She has a degree in chemistry and biophysics and formerly worked as a quality control chemist at Pfizer.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.500]  She resides in Western Australia where the crackdown on the vaccinated has been the worst.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:04.659]  This is an old bio she might have updated.
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:08.420]  She was an eyewitness account of the COVID-19 measures having been implemented there.
[02:04:08.819 --> 02:04:10.840]  And she's been one of those many times on many issues.
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:12.920]  Very smart lady at Partisan Girl.
[02:04:13.619 --> 02:04:15.920]  So Syrian girl, great to have you here with us.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:20.100]  I'm sorry to see what's happening to your home country.
[02:04:20.739 --> 02:04:22.979]  And you've kind of heard my boil down.
[02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.279]  I'm sure you've got an even more astute one.
[02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.500]  But I mentioned some of the clips we're going to play historically.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:29.899]  This is very important, obviously.
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.840]  But I had General Flynn on last hour.
[02:04:31.939 --> 02:04:33.880]  And it's not even hidden that the West did this.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:40.819]  Israel, NATO, and of course Turkey is the big machine here with a big military, conventional military.
[02:04:41.739 --> 02:04:45.479]  And this is going to be, already is a horrible fiasco.
[02:04:45.579 --> 02:04:49.119]  They're already slaughtering the Christians en masse and other Muslim minorities.
[02:04:49.819 --> 02:04:52.140]  Quite a humanitarian disaster.
[02:04:52.319 --> 02:04:57.960]  Assad has fled and been given humanitarian amnesty in Russia by Vladimir Putin.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:00.199]  So Syrian girl, thanks for being here.
[02:05:01.439 --> 02:05:03.680]  Thank you so much for having me on, Alex.
[02:05:03.939 --> 02:05:08.939]  You've been with us from the beginning, and I'll never forget everything you've done for us.
[02:05:09.159 --> 02:05:09.920]  So, thank you.
[02:05:10.479 --> 02:05:12.779]  Well, listen, it's for everybody, but I do care about everybody.
[02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:16.720]  But, I mean, they want to, I mean, General Flynn said this is World War III now.
[02:05:16.939 --> 02:05:18.520]  He expects big moves with China.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:22.659]  You already see it in Korea, Romania, Georgia.
[02:05:22.939 --> 02:05:24.020]  I mean, all hell's breaking loose.
[02:05:24.119 --> 02:05:25.640]  So, we're in World War III right now.
[02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:28.270]  I believe so.
[02:05:28.409 --> 02:05:31.189]  And I think things are probably going to get worse.
[02:05:31.369 --> 02:05:38.369]  I mean, I have serious doubts that there's going to be a ceasefire in Ukraine.
[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:43.609]  And if there isn't, I mean, Russia is going to feel more cornered than ever now.
[02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:52.970]  Because I believe Russia will stay in Syria, but now their position is much more precarious because Turkey has taken over.
[02:05:53.750 --> 02:06:03.970]  Syria using these al-Qaeda rebels and Turkey is a part of NATO. So it's going to have a lot less negotiation ground, you might say.
[02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:14.550]  I guess I'll wait for your questions because I don't want to go off and start rambling about what happened.
[02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:17.069]  Obviously we were betrayed.
[02:06:17.710 --> 02:06:19.069]  We were sold out.
[02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:38.819]  And when I say we, I mean the people who fought for 12 years and essentially gave up maybe life and limb for this cause and unfortunately the The powers that be that conspired against us were just simply too great.
[02:06:39.439 --> 02:06:45.539]  You know, the Israelis, they've been working with Al-Qaeda on the Golan Heights.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:48.300]  They have been giving them medical treatment.
[02:06:48.619 --> 02:06:51.140]  They have been giving them weapons.
[02:06:51.439 --> 02:06:56.319]  And I'm sending your team some articles that you might bring up onto your screen.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:11.880]  That, you know, essentially, and especially the last, the very last article I just sent your team, I think would be topical, that Israel has already completely admitted that they were backing this revolution in Syria.
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:19.720]  From the beginning, they've been photographed with Al-Qaeda at the Golan Heights, just hanging out.
[02:07:19.899 --> 02:07:27.909]  The guy that photographed them, Sidqi Al-Maqt, he actually was Sentenced to 15 years in prison.
[02:07:28.130 --> 02:07:30.529]  He's a Syrian man that was living under Israeli occupation.
[02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:43.229]  So it was something that they didn't really want to make too public, but they were perfectly fine to admit that they were giving weapons to the Syrian rebels and that they were giving medical treatment to Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:55.369]  The ex-head of Mossad actually went on an interview with Al Jazeera's Yeah, we're giving Al-Qaeda medical treatment.
[02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:57.609]  And he said, oh, well, why?
[02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:59.510]  And he goes, oh, we're just humanitarians.
[02:07:59.710 --> 02:08:03.210]  And so he asked him, well, would you do the same if it was Hezbollah?
[02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:07.109]  And he goes, no, no, no, Hezbollah has actually attacked Israel, so we wouldn't do that.
[02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:08.909]  And he's like, but what about Al-Qaeda?
[02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:12.689]  Didn't they attack your strongest ally, the United States?
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.899]  And he's like, well, that's got nothing to do with us, though.
[02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.659]  So I would encourage everybody to go and watch that interview.
[02:08:19.939 --> 02:08:22.600]  If you can, I will send it to your team.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:25.060]  Maybe even you can play the clip.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:32.020]  Because at the end of the day, this was a conspiracy because Israel attacked Right now I wanted the land grab.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.460]  You know, Israel always has this excuse that it's bombing Syria because Iran is there.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:40.460]  It's bombing Syria because Hezbollah is there.
[02:08:40.659 --> 02:08:49.060]  But now there's no Iran and there's no Hezbollah because they've all been told to just retreat because there has been essentially a surrender.
[02:08:49.439 --> 02:08:51.819]  And what ends up happening?
[02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:54.649]  Israel doesn't stop bombing Syria.
[02:08:54.930 --> 02:08:56.329]  It increases the bombings.
[02:08:56.489 --> 02:09:00.770]  I saw in your tweet, you asked, why is Israel bombing Syria?
[02:09:01.090 --> 02:09:09.270]  They actually openly said, you know, we are bombing Syria in order to deny Syria the capability of ever resisting us in future.
[02:09:10.249 --> 02:09:14.989]  And they've made plans about creating a buffer zone.
[02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:17.029]  They call it a buffer zone, okay?
[02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:20.489]  Which is hilarious because it's essentially a land grab.
[02:09:20.789 --> 02:09:26.390]  And I will again show you their buffer zone plans, quote-unquote, and how it comes in stages.
[02:09:26.630 --> 02:09:28.430]  And we're only in the first stage.
[02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:32.729]  There's four other stages where they intend to take the entire south of Syria.
[02:09:32.949 --> 02:09:38.069]  And the disgusting thing is, you know, it wasn't enough that...
[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:40.699]  It was a power transfer.
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:56.720]  But these jihadis that they basically sold their country out to Israel are currently celebrating in the streets, handing out sweets as the Israeli tanks roll in, as the Israeli jets bomb all of Syria's military capabilities,
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:57.939]  all of its air defenses.
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:09:58.899]  And why?
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:09:59.960]  Why, you ask?
[02:10:00.119 --> 02:10:03.800]  Because at the end of the day, this is not about Israel's security.
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:06.560]  It's about Israel wanting to steal more land.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:09.000]  Well, that's not even denied.
[02:10:09.819 --> 02:10:11.800]  Turkey says they're going to take a big piece of Syria.
[02:10:12.739 --> 02:10:14.520]  Israel is taking a big piece.
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:17.600]  I mean, hell, I guess they'll take the whole thing.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.060]  Who else is going to divide up Syria?
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:23.439]  I mean, if Israel wanted, it could take the whole thing.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.039]  And, you know, you think, oh, what about the fact that Syrian people lived there?
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:33.699]  You know, when Israel took over the Syrian Golan Heights, they basically genocided everybody there.
[02:10:34.199 --> 02:10:36.619]  It used to be 12% Christian, okay?
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:42.979]  I can show you the pictures of the burnt-out churches that they destroyed when they were pushing the Christians out.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:47.039]  I'm talking about Israelis pushing the Christians out of the Golan Heights because they're not Jewish.
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:48.239]  They want a Jewish state.
[02:10:48.439 --> 02:10:50.720]  They don't want any other religion in there.
[02:10:50.859 --> 02:10:56.739]  And they don't want our ethnicity in there, right, which is Syrian, which is the original people that lived in that land.
[02:10:56.979 --> 02:10:58.880]  I mean, the writing is on the wall.
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:04.260]  Well, I mean, the Israeli troops wear the greater Israel patch.
[02:11:06.079 --> 02:11:07.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:10.479]  And it's a Messianic prophecy, right?
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:13.439]  They believe that this is granted by God.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:24.960]  And doesn't that remind you a lot of ISIS? You know, they said that Syrian land belongs to them by virtue of the fact that they're Muslim, and if they take over Damascus, then the Messiah will return.
[02:11:27.199 --> 02:11:37.319]  That's exactly what these crazies Are saying when they destroy, they rebuild the third temple, it's going to bring about the coming of the Antichrist.
[02:11:37.779 --> 02:11:40.539]  I'm sure you've seen such discussions.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:46.800]  There's major evangelical groups with Israel trying to build the third temple, trying to kill the red heifer.
[02:11:47.239 --> 02:11:50.539]  I mean, and then you've got evangelicals going, yay, the end of the world's here.
[02:11:50.699 --> 02:11:51.079]  It's...
[02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:55.149]  I don't think God's very happy about people trying to play this.
[02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:57.069]  And again, everybody knows I don't hate Israel.
[02:11:57.069 --> 02:11:58.310]  I don't want to destroy Israel.
[02:11:58.649 --> 02:12:05.250]  But I don't think Israel should have helped found Hamas, which they admit, and now putting Al-Qaeda into the country and CNN saying they're great.
[02:12:05.369 --> 02:12:06.010]  That's wrong.
[02:12:06.789 --> 02:12:10.109]  And so you can say, okay, Assad's not a perfect guy.
[02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:12.449]  Al-Assad, I know he threw your family out of the country.
[02:12:12.670 --> 02:12:14.569]  You've talked about that, so you're not even for Assad.
[02:12:14.729 --> 02:12:18.270]  The point is, you get rid of one thing and bring in something a hundred times worse.
[02:12:18.329 --> 02:12:18.949]  Can you speak to that?
[02:12:20.409 --> 02:12:26.710]  Well, you know, my grandfather was in the government that was in power before the Baal Party coup.
[02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:32.109]  My family didn't benefit anything from the Ba'ath Party.
[02:12:32.289 --> 02:12:35.810]  But what we wanted was to see our country remain whole.
[02:12:36.409 --> 02:12:43.869]  And when the Israelis were basically arming al-Qaeda to take over Syria, which tragically is what happened.
[02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:48.989]  I mean, Jolani, the guy was a member of ISIS in Iraq.
[02:12:49.210 --> 02:12:50.289]  He joined al-Qaeda.
[02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:57.979]  And now he goes on to CNN. He's like, Well, that was just a phase of my life, you know, like being emo or going punk for a little while.
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:02.399]  I just beheaded a bunch of people and blew up a bunch of people that didn't believe in my faith.
[02:13:02.399 --> 02:13:03.579]  But I've changed now.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.319]  I truly have.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.560]  And, you know, even if he has, what about all the people that he killed?
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:11.720]  Like, what about all of the innocent lives that were lost?
[02:13:11.779 --> 02:13:14.939]  And CNN and others are like, well, yes, the West, Israel...
[02:13:16.569 --> 02:13:18.930]  Turkey are funding the al-Qaeda leader, but it's okay.
[02:13:18.989 --> 02:13:19.729]  He's a nice person.
[02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:23.909]  And they go, yeah, women will wear burqas, and they are gonna blow the churches up, but that's okay.
[02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:24.449]  It's liberal.
[02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.829]  Precisely.
[02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:29.170]  So we knew what the plan was.
[02:13:29.170 --> 02:13:36.189]  When this whole quote-unquote revolution started, they were chanting sectarian slogans, and we realized, you know what?
[02:13:36.449 --> 02:13:41.949]  This is a plot to destroy Syria, and we're gonna have to, who would you side with?
[02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:43.989]  You would side with your army, right?
[02:13:46.399 --> 02:13:54.359]  And I think it's very clear, just like Iraq 1 and 2, these different forces bought off most of the leadership of the military.
[02:13:54.579 --> 02:13:56.300]  It doesn't appear.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.560]  The Syrian military basically stood down.
[02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:07.010]  Yes, and the thing that sickens me the most is that they did stand down.
[02:14:07.489 --> 02:14:13.810]  There are many different question marks about this fact.
[02:14:14.210 --> 02:14:21.710]  First, I've heard the notion that there was some kind of a mutiny in Aleppo that caused this.
[02:14:22.130 --> 02:14:27.609]  The other scenario is that we were simply overwhelmed and so we withdrew.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:35.039]  After 13 years of war, maybe they just pulled it in.
[02:14:35.859 --> 02:14:41.260]  Maybe all these massive armies were masked perfectly, and then the military stands down and they call it a coup.
[02:14:42.119 --> 02:14:43.460]  Syrian girl, I've studied this.
[02:14:43.699 --> 02:14:46.300]  There's no doubt this whole thing was rigged.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:52.159]  I mean, you know, in Gulf War I and II, 80 plus percent of the Iraqi generals were already paid off.
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.699]  They were reporting directly to the Pentagon.
[02:14:55.659 --> 02:15:03.520]  And that's how the Germans captured France in a month, is they bought off almost all of the French general staff and then put them in charge afterwards.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:08.319]  That's how Hitler, a month after the invasion of France, was already touring Paris.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.800]  It was because they set up the Vichy French government.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:19.699]  And, you know, Syria, the sanctions, essentially the sanctions worked.
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.340]  If you remember when we, when Syria was going strong, you know, they liberated Aleppo.
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.600]  They were going to march on to Idlib province.
[02:15:28.279 --> 02:15:39.800]  But what ended up happening, there was a ceasefire agreement signed in Astana between Turkey, Iran, and Russia, basically to freeze the conflict in Syria for a short while.
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:51.439]  But the sanctions weakened Syria while the Turks were arming and training with drones the insurgency.
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:58.060]  So Syria was basically blood, blood dried to the last drop.
[02:15:58.710 --> 02:16:11.210]  When this final straw happened, Syria was facing a U.S. occupation in the east, where they were basically preventing us from using our own oil and our own wheat.
[02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:14.930]  That was the point of the U.S. occupation, which, by the way, remains in Syria.
[02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:16.770]  And by the way- No, absolutely.
[02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:20.050]  So Syria has been under siege for, what, at least 14, 15 years?
[02:16:22.100 --> 02:16:22.819]  Yes, exactly.
[02:16:23.199 --> 02:16:26.619]  So we could have, in my view, we should have kept fighting.
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:27.760]  We should have kept fighting.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:31.399]  But unfortunately, maybe there was a soft coup with people.
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:36.920]  I'm not even blaming the Syrian military finally giving up, because they got told, hey, we're about to invade from three, four sides.
[02:16:37.139 --> 02:16:38.700]  And they just said, we can't do this again.
[02:16:39.799 --> 02:16:44.399]  And Israelis, there was already, like, we knew that Israelis were going to invade.
[02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:48.450]  And we actually knew that these Turks were going to invade.
[02:16:49.569 --> 02:16:55.549]  And the East was already occupied by the U.S. So there were too many fronts.
[02:16:55.809 --> 02:17:06.540]  But again, I don't know who gave the order to stand down, but whoever gave that order to stand down The result of that is that all of Syria's air defense systems were destroyed.
[02:17:07.079 --> 02:17:13.520]  Maybe Syria ended up fighting the Al-Qaeda or rebel forces, whatever you want to call it.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:17.079]  But now Syria is going to be literally and financially and culturally raped.
[02:17:18.219 --> 02:17:20.299]  Yeah, well, we don't have any defenses anymore.
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.959]  So obviously it was a bad decision from the decision makers.
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:28.719]  Literally like 30 minutes ago, the Israelis are still bombing.
[02:17:28.799 --> 02:17:30.899]  As we speak, they're still bombing.
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.500]  They're bombing the bases in Tartus.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.420]  Well, come on.
[02:17:34.299 --> 02:17:36.120]  Syria, the Christians deserve it.
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:39.940]  Look, this is loving and liberal.
[02:17:40.139 --> 02:17:40.899]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:41.479]  This is sick.
[02:17:41.979 --> 02:17:43.659]  We'll be right back with Syrian Girl with a bunch of key clubs.
[02:17:43.879 --> 02:17:44.299]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:52.549]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:53.670]  What an amazing aircraft.
[02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:59.090]  This is one of the pinnacles of my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[02:17:59.090 --> 02:18:00.309]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:01.229]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.909]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:18:01.989 --> 02:18:02.790]  I can't wait.
[02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:05.489]  To learn who the next winner is.
[02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:08.069]  And even if they shout out Infowars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:10.229]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me.
[02:18:10.350 --> 02:18:14.409]  So we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[02:18:14.569 --> 02:18:15.170]  We already knew that.
[02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:16.510]  But now they've bragged about it.
[02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:21.750]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:18:21.930 --> 02:18:25.850]  And so this baby is a new promotion and I will be...
[02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:34.129]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alk Shows Network family.
[02:18:34.409 --> 02:18:35.770]  You are our family.
[02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:37.209]  God bless you all.
[02:18:37.450 --> 02:18:40.450]  Now go to thealkshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:42.309]  Please stand by for further details.
[02:18:42.670 --> 02:18:44.649]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[02:18:44.829 --> 02:18:48.329]  Alright, I want to give people some background here and I want to be 100% clear.
[02:18:49.090 --> 02:18:53.790]  I have read probably, let's not exaggerate, over 100 books on the Middle East in history.
[02:18:53.889 --> 02:18:55.629]  It's very, on the last...
[02:18:56.420 --> 02:18:57.379]  150 years.
[02:18:57.799 --> 02:19:01.520]  And I've read hundreds of other books, history books that had big pieces of it.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.139]  It's fascinating.
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:04.620]  I've been studying this stuff since I was 10 years old.
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:09.299]  And then I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of expert guests from around the world.
[02:19:09.719 --> 02:19:13.299]  And I've read thousands and thousands and thousands of articles.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:16.659]  And I still get confused by a lot of it, okay?
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.600]  The general public knows almost nothing.
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.459]  Even the people in Washington making their decisions, they have a lot of sociologists and anthropologists.
[02:19:26.229 --> 02:19:28.489]  They try to manipulate the different sides over there.
[02:19:28.989 --> 02:19:32.690]  And then it always just makes things degenerate even faster.
[02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:34.690]  And you can say, well, look at them.
[02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:35.270]  They're idiots.
[02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:36.469]  They can't get their act together.
[02:19:36.690 --> 02:19:39.950]  The Middle East, that whole area is the cradle of civilization.
[02:19:40.709 --> 02:20:01.030]  And if you look at Lebanon and you look at Syria and you look at Iran and Iraq and all those places, they were just as developed and nice as anywhere in the Western world until The West put the global currency pegged to oil.
[02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:11.229]  And Israel was already there in the late 1940s, and then it's used as the pretext in the media that they're the good guys, everybody else is the bad guys.
[02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:16.290]  And then even if you love Israel, let's just say that, because I'm not against any of these groups.
[02:20:17.629 --> 02:20:29.989]  It's used then as the pretext that, well, if Israel's against somebody, they've got to be bad, and then they play the Arabs off against each other, and they play the Shiites off against the Well, hobbyists and all the rest of it, and it just goes on and on.
[02:20:30.229 --> 02:20:34.690]  And if you watch congressional reports and you read State Department stuff, they say this.
[02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:36.950]  And they're bragging about it now.
[02:20:37.770 --> 02:20:47.350]  So, the West has totally wrecked that area of the world and has purposely kept Africa wrecked.
[02:20:48.639 --> 02:20:52.879]  And Gaddafi was stabilizing Africa in the north, and South Africa was stabilizing it in the south.
[02:20:53.079 --> 02:20:58.659]  Two different regimes, two different systems, both had their problems, but compared to what they got, they were angels.
[02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:01.780]  Now Africa has descended into the worst it's ever been.
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:09.659]  And Gaddafi was creating a new African Union, building infrastructure around Africa, taking the oil money of Libya.
[02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:12.959]  He tried to come into the West, be buddies with Obama, got set up and killed.
[02:21:14.569 --> 02:21:15.190]  And he knew that.
[02:21:15.229 --> 02:21:16.110]  He said, don't kill us.
[02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:17.829]  We'll roll over and invest our money with you.
[02:21:17.909 --> 02:21:19.209]  But then they set him up and killed him.
[02:21:20.709 --> 02:21:25.750]  And of course, they killed Saddam Hussein, who was trained by the CIA to be a hitman and killed the Baathist leader.
[02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:26.750]  And then they put him in power.
[02:21:26.829 --> 02:21:27.909]  They told him to attack Iran.
[02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:28.670]  He followed orders.
[02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:31.229]  Then they set him up, told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:35.950]  When he did, April Gillespie, the U.S. ambassador, he got on TV and said, you told me to do this.
[02:21:35.989 --> 02:21:36.670]  What the hell are you doing?
[02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:41.430]  And they had a lady, a 14-year-old, oh, I saw him stomping baby's brains out.
[02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:43.170]  She's never been to Iraq, never been to Kuwait.
[02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:47.389]  That was all BS. It later came out, that was fake.
[02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:48.190]  The baby's an incubator.
[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:50.989]  So, I'm not saying Saddam Hussein's a good guy.
[02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:52.190]  I'm not saying Assad's a good guy.
[02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.989]  I'm not saying any of that.
[02:21:53.389 --> 02:22:05.090]  I'm saying that the West went in there since the 1950s and purposely wrecked the whole place, assassinated all these people, and now...
[02:22:06.129 --> 02:22:14.989]  Turkey, NATO, the United States, and Israel are gang-raping, literally, the Syrians and the Christians and everybody else, and it's a war crime.
[02:22:16.329 --> 02:22:17.950]  It's a crime against humanity.
[02:22:18.809 --> 02:22:20.170]  And it's disgusting.
[02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:22.409]  And it's dangerous.
[02:22:24.329 --> 02:22:24.889]  And...
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:32.260]  It's sad to see the Syrians holding all this off for 14 years and now collapse into this.
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:34.959]  I've not walked a mile in their shoes.
[02:22:34.959 --> 02:22:36.219]  I can't say that...
[02:22:36.219 --> 02:22:40.200]  It's just a total disaster, though.
[02:22:40.899 --> 02:22:43.079]  And then you see them, oh, Assad used chemical weapons.
[02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:45.540]  That was confirmed to be faked by even corporate media later.
[02:22:46.079 --> 02:22:48.459]  We confirmed it as it happened.
[02:22:49.399 --> 02:22:51.860]  So, and now they got Al-Qaeda trotting around.
[02:22:52.059 --> 02:22:53.360]  The CNN's like, well, they're good now.
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:56.879]  This is 1984. East Asia, Central Asia's our enemy.
[02:22:56.979 --> 02:22:58.000]  No, it's always been our friend.
[02:22:59.819 --> 02:23:00.899]  War is peace.
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:02.100]  Freedom is slavery.
[02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:08.120]  And that's where we are.
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.559]  Double thing.
[02:23:10.799 --> 02:23:14.000]  So I want to play a few clips to get Syrian girls' take on this.
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.940]  Here is Wesley Clark.
[02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:20.629]  This is like 15 years ago.
[02:23:21.329 --> 02:23:23.370]  Talking about the plan to overthrow the whole Middle East.
[02:23:23.569 --> 02:23:25.389]  And since then he's come out and endorses it.
[02:23:25.829 --> 02:23:29.389]  And then I'm going to play it back to back with a clip of Qaddafi at the Arab League.
[02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:32.409]  Warning them this was coming.
[02:23:32.629 --> 02:23:38.510]  And then Al-Assad, who just got thrown out three days ago, laughing.
[02:23:40.420 --> 02:23:44.659]  Maybe he was laughing because he was uncomfortable, but no one's laughing at Muammar Gaddafi now.
[02:23:45.079 --> 02:23:51.319]  And out of this whole cast of characters, Muammar Gaddafi, compared to our leaders, is an angel.
[02:23:54.819 --> 02:23:58.879]  He didn't have 15 Ferraris or Lamborghinis or whatever.
[02:24:00.079 --> 02:24:05.100]  He lived in a tent and literally put almost all the money into stabilizing his population in Africa.
[02:24:05.889 --> 02:24:07.870]  And then he said, look, I'll roll over.
[02:24:07.989 --> 02:24:08.329]  I'll invest.
[02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:09.229]  Just don't kill us.
[02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:11.290]  He said, I know you're coming to kill us all.
[02:24:12.149 --> 02:24:13.090]  I'll roll over.
[02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:14.850]  So they gang raped him and murdered him.
[02:24:16.270 --> 02:24:17.590]  With Al-Qaeda, as usual.
[02:24:18.489 --> 02:24:19.790]  And then they had the Arab Spring.
[02:24:19.989 --> 02:24:21.430]  And CNN said, this is good.
[02:24:22.329 --> 02:24:22.989]  Millions killed.
[02:24:26.370 --> 02:24:26.770]  So...
[02:24:26.770 --> 02:24:29.430]  This is pure evil.
[02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:32.329]  And now...
[02:24:34.139 --> 02:24:34.920]  It's already happened.
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:57.799]  We'll be fighting for decades because the new hatchery, the new nursery, the new fishery to grow the Al-Qaeda Wahhabist folks is not going to be Afghanistan,
[02:24:57.799 --> 02:24:59.739]  though they gave $87 million of weapons.
[02:24:59.799 --> 02:25:00.239]  Biden did.
[02:25:00.659 --> 02:25:02.280]  No, it's going to be Syria.
[02:25:03.799 --> 02:25:05.319]  I'll be the new cauldron.
[02:25:05.819 --> 02:25:11.020]  And then Israel will have to always expand because they're going to be attacked by terrorists they created.
[02:25:11.399 --> 02:25:15.459]  And Turkey will have to expand because they're going to fight terrorists they publicly created.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:23.840]  And they'll think a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, as Israel and Turkey take the whole country, they'll think we don't remember.
[02:25:24.079 --> 02:25:40.280]  I mean, look, if they don't even kill this guy in a month, in a year or two years, The U.S. will be, maybe even next month, Biden just called for it yesterday, officially invading Syria to stop the Al-Qaeda they just put in.
[02:25:40.399 --> 02:25:41.780]  And by the way, I showed the articles yesterday.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:43.079]  I'll show them to you while Syrian girl's talking.
[02:25:43.459 --> 02:25:45.000]  Israel admits they're funding these guys.
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:46.100]  Turkey admits it.
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:51.239]  For new viewers tuning in going, this is how dare you say our government and others are funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:52.579]  They admit it!
[02:25:53.959 --> 02:25:58.780]  I told you a week ago Turkey and Israel, when they two were behind this, and people were like, Jones, don't jump the gun.
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:25:59.899]  They admitted it then!
[02:26:01.479 --> 02:26:03.540]  It's not my fault I'm informed.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:06.459]  It's not my fault I study this.
[02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:12.639]  It's your fault if you're a new listener and you tune in and you think, well, this sounds crazy.
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:13.420]  You're not.
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.979]  An elementary level analysis of this would tell you this is true.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:20.340]  Don't believe me when I said those chemical attacks were fake.
[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:20.799]  It came out.
[02:26:20.899 --> 02:26:21.420]  Go look it up.
[02:26:24.979 --> 02:26:30.000]  And by fake, they were launched by ISIS. Because they couldn't help themselves.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.319]  They wanted to videotape it because they get money when they do it.
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.680]  It's like, you know, a buck hunter that wants to show off the deer he killed to his buddies and then mount it on the wall.
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:49.319]  So, the people that eat human hearts and rape six-year-old girls to death, remember that case?
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.299]  She got raped by like 170 men and died.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:56.879]  Showed ISIS in...
[02:26:57.809 --> 02:27:01.950]  We show you this footage in Libya under Hillary's.
[02:27:01.989 --> 02:27:03.030]  I came, I saw, he died.
[02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:12.889]  And they were sawing off pieces of dead people they killed and making the Muslims eat it before they killed them so that they would go to hell because you're not supposed to eat people under Islam.
[02:27:14.430 --> 02:27:16.149]  I mean, these are freakazoids.
[02:27:17.219 --> 02:27:19.000]  You couldn't find worse people.
[02:27:19.299 --> 02:27:30.659]  You know, we got our women and children and our testicles grew up at the airport because of a supposed Al-Qaeda attack 23 years ago that was a CIA, globalist, intel.
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:33.620]  Israel had fingerprints all over it as well.
[02:27:35.159 --> 02:27:40.459]  And so, I want to go back to Syrian girl and we'll go a little bit to the next hour because I don't know she's got a lot to say, but I want to just set some history here.
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.559]  Of how immoral and evil this is.
[02:27:43.659 --> 02:27:48.000]  And of course, the bigger targets, Russia and China, who've got giant nuclear weapons arsenals.
[02:27:48.139 --> 02:27:57.680]  So, the globalists like to keep picking on disarmed countries like Iraq and Syria, but they're there poking and bombing Russia.
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:27:58.719]  Come on, come on.
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:27:59.780]  Have a nuclear war.
[02:27:59.899 --> 02:28:00.739]  Come on, come on.
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:06.319]  And you see General Flynn on first hour saying, we're in World War III. This is madness to hand Trump a total disaster.
[02:28:06.459 --> 02:28:08.600]  We'll talk about big picture and how we stop this and what comes next.
[02:28:09.799 --> 02:28:12.000]  There should be protests everywhere, peaceful protests.
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:16.520]  Instead, we're all hearing about Daniel Penny and Black Lives Matter says burn the country down.
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:17.379]  Told you that was coming.
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:28.659]  Virus, race war, economic collapse, World War III. That's the tracks they got going for Trump.
[02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:31.409]  As he says, yeah, I'm going to arrest the deep state.
[02:28:31.850 --> 02:28:37.649]  So, we are in a good position, awakening-wise, but not in a power position yet.
[02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:49.049]  Here's the clips of former top general of the Middle East, Wesley Clark, and then we'll go into Qaddafi's very prophetic warning.
[02:28:49.049 --> 02:28:49.510]  Here it is.
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:57.680]  About 10 days after 9-11, I went through the Pentagon, and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz.
[02:28:57.739 --> 02:29:02.360]  I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.579]  And one of the generals called me in.
[02:29:03.659 --> 02:29:06.920]  He said, sir, you got to come in and talk to me a second.
[02:29:06.979 --> 02:29:07.819]  I said, well, you're too busy.
[02:29:07.979 --> 02:29:08.579]  He said, no, no.
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:11.819]  He says, we've made the decision.
[02:29:11.979 --> 02:29:13.319]  We're going to war with Iraq.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:15.860]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:18.399]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq.
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:18.840]  Why?
[02:29:20.739 --> 02:29:22.319]  He said, I don't know.
[02:29:23.819 --> 02:29:26.040]  He said, I guess they don't know what else to do.
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:32.399]  So I said, well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to Al-Qaeda?
[02:29:32.559 --> 02:29:33.860]  He said, no, no.
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:35.840]  He says, there's nothing new that way.
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.639]  They've just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.
[02:29:38.899 --> 02:29:46.319]  He said, I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists, but We've got a good military and we can take down governments.
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:51.819]  And he said, I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.
[02:29:53.229 --> 02:29:58.809]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[02:29:58.809 --> 02:30:00.590]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[02:30:00.729 --> 02:30:02.149]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[02:30:02.370 --> 02:30:18.770]  He said, he reached over on his desk, he picked up a piece of paper, he said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs, meeting the Secretary of Defense's office today, and he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria,
[02:30:18.930 --> 02:30:22.750]  Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:33.520]  The truth is about the Middle East is, had there been no oil there, it would be like Africa.
[02:30:35.859 --> 02:30:38.860]  Nobody is threatening to intervene in Africa.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:40.680]  The problem is the opposite.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.840]  We keep asking for people to intervene and stop it.
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:52.139]  And there's no question that the presence of petroleum throughout the region has sparked great power involvement.
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:55.979]  Whether that was the specific motivation for the coup or not, I can't tell you.
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:31:02.440]  But there's always been this attitude that somehow we could intervene and use force in the region.
[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:06.760]  The Arabian people who have killed them, they're not afraid.
[02:31:06.940 --> 02:31:07.000]  Why?
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:21.959]  Why do you have a statement about Saddam Hussein?
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:28.979]  Why did America fight against Saddam Hussein against Khomeini?
[02:31:29.299 --> 02:31:30.000]  She was a friend.
[02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:32.139]  Sheenie was a friend of Saddam Hussein.
[02:31:53.259 --> 02:31:54.319]  We're a radio listener.
[02:31:54.479 --> 02:31:55.340]  You know, that was in Arabic.
[02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:56.540]  We had subtitles.
[02:31:56.659 --> 02:31:58.639]  But he said, you know, they got a plan to take us all down.
[02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:01.620]  And they're going to come after all you next.
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:02.700]  So you better watch out.
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:03.540]  They start laughing at him.
[02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:11.549]  So, and they're going to put Al-Qaeda in charge of everywhere, because that's what Saudi Arabia wants.
[02:32:12.610 --> 02:32:15.709]  Saudi Arabia claims that they're distancing themselves, that they're not involved in this.
[02:32:15.829 --> 02:32:20.549]  We can get Syrian girl, who's really an expert on this take, but thanks for holding while I went through all that.
[02:32:20.649 --> 02:32:21.430]  Do you agree with it?
[02:32:21.489 --> 02:32:22.270]  Do you want to add to it?
[02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:23.350]  Where do you think this is going next?
[02:32:24.010 --> 02:32:24.530]  Syrian girl.
[02:32:25.389 --> 02:32:27.469]  Well, it's prophetic words, isn't it?
[02:32:27.610 --> 02:32:41.430]  And people point out, oh, Assad was laughing, but I think he was more laughing in agreement with the moxie of Gaddafi, because not many people would have went up and said, like, you're all going to get killed by the United States.
[02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:42.809]  If you keep going like this.
[02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:43.850]  And he was right.
[02:32:44.010 --> 02:32:54.209]  But if you observe, it's really only the countries that kind of had any kind of resistance towards Israel or opposition towards Israel that end up getting lynched, like Gaddafi, for example.
[02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:58.110]  And, you know, Assad thankfully didn't suffer the same fate.
[02:32:58.389 --> 02:33:06.030]  At the same time, you know, people wonder why he didn't go down with the ship as the captain, you know, as they say.
[02:33:07.139 --> 02:33:12.940]  But at least Hillary Clinton is not going to relish somewhere because of a video of his death, right?
[02:33:13.239 --> 02:33:16.120]  At the very least, we are spared that demonic nature.
[02:33:17.319 --> 02:33:25.989]  When Wesley Clark said it was seven countries in five years We lasted a lot longer than five years, didn't we?
[02:33:26.209 --> 02:33:28.889]  We put up a really, really good fight.
[02:33:29.809 --> 02:33:32.450]  And I think we could have gone on longer.
[02:33:32.729 --> 02:33:36.530]  But the plans of our enemies were to divide the country.
[02:33:36.989 --> 02:33:38.750]  Like, that is the objective at the end of the day.
[02:33:38.989 --> 02:33:43.049]  They drew up the Eau de Yunnan plan and how they're going to carve things out.
[02:33:44.049 --> 02:33:46.229]  Maybe they're still going to achieve that.
[02:33:46.489 --> 02:33:54.030]  At the moment, HTS, which is backed by Turkey, It has the majority of the country.
[02:33:54.370 --> 02:33:57.729]  Only the Kurds remain in the east.
[02:33:57.889 --> 02:34:04.030]  They are part of a communist group called the YPG. They believe in anarcho-communism.
[02:34:04.629 --> 02:34:08.450]  So Turkey's not very happy with them, so I'm not sure how long they'll last.
[02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:13.750]  The video showing there is Israel currently blowing up all of our weapons stores in Latakia.
[02:34:13.989 --> 02:34:17.049]  Basically anything that Syria can defend itself with.
[02:34:17.309 --> 02:34:32.850]  The problem is, guys, You know, people are in this false sense of security that it ends here, that Israel is just bombing everything that Syria has to defend itself, but it's not going to go more than that, you know?
[02:34:32.989 --> 02:34:35.270]  But what's to stop them from going more than that?
[02:34:35.430 --> 02:34:38.110]  The next thing that could happen is an invasion.
[02:34:38.370 --> 02:34:54.229]  If you look at the map drawn by Oded Yunon, they want to create a little piece of Syria in the south, And they want to basically connect up with a minority group called the Druze minority,
[02:34:54.430 --> 02:35:02.629]  D-R-U-Z-E. But the problem is a bunch of Sunnis are in the way in a town called Daraa.
[02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:07.049]  So that place is probably going to be genocide if they're going to achieve their goals.
[02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:10.549]  And now there's nothing to stop that from happening.
[02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:15.350]  They're going to do to Syria what they did to Gaza because we don't have any more defenses.
[02:35:16.359 --> 02:35:24.260]  Unfortunately, I hope the only thing that could stop that is maybe some diplomacy from our allies, but who tells Israel what to do?
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:26.079]  Not even the United States, right?
[02:35:29.209 --> 02:35:31.510]  I guess I'm at a loss.
[02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.709]  I'm actually very disappointed.
[02:35:33.989 --> 02:35:35.950]  So you can see the green area right there.
[02:35:36.090 --> 02:35:41.069]  That's the part of Syria that Israel wants to take over, and they intend to use the Druze minority.
[02:35:41.329 --> 02:35:44.409]  How are they going to try to play this out?
[02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:55.489]  Is they're going to try now to use the religious crazies to attack the minorities, like the Christians, like the Druze.
[02:35:55.829 --> 02:36:13.159]  And once that happens, even though they themselves supported these guys, even though they themselves, as you said, armed them, They're going to use the fact that Jolani has a $10 million bounty on his head by the United States FBI to say,
[02:36:13.299 --> 02:36:17.079]  well, you know what, we're going to have to come in and save the minorities.
[02:36:17.379 --> 02:36:19.579]  And they're going to use that excuse as a land grab.
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:26.739]  And the only thing to stop this is that there isn't any ethnic violence.
[02:36:27.319 --> 02:36:31.350]  At the moment, There have been, but minimally.
[02:36:31.770 --> 02:36:47.790]  But once these guys consolidate their power, I'm worried about what's going to happen to the Christian minority, to other minorities, and essentially what kind of laws they're going to impose, etc.,
[02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:47.989]  etc.
[02:36:49.870 --> 02:37:01.450]  So I guess I wanted to say I hope you guys won't forget about us because I want to thank you for being with us and exposing everything that's happening.
[02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:06.489]  History is written by the victor, but we know the truth.
[02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:12.690]  And we're the ones that are going to have to carry its torch and not let it die.
[02:37:12.709 --> 02:37:13.370]  Well, absolutely.
[02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:21.110]  And for the average American or even European or somebody that Doesn't care about other countries because they miss empathy and understand what happens to somebody else could happen to you.
[02:37:21.450 --> 02:37:22.809]  But it should be second nature.
[02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:25.530]  It's not even you should feel bad because you have a conscience.
[02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:31.170]  But then there's also a reason God gave us consciences because it makes us live a better life and safer life and better life.
[02:37:32.530 --> 02:37:39.149]  We've been flooded with these jihadis, and they're able to protest in Canada and Europe, and anybody protesting against COVID, you get arrested.
[02:37:39.489 --> 02:37:41.450]  The indigenous population can't do that.
[02:37:41.569 --> 02:37:49.290]  Then real people that are good people in the Middle East that need to flee, they get demonized because of the scum that's been brought in.
[02:37:49.489 --> 02:37:55.510]  And the prisons then put the radical jihadists in charge, wherever you are in the world, the U.S., Europe, you name it.
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:07.200]  We're good to go.
[02:38:14.290 --> 02:38:15.510]  And it's very, very cold-blooded.
[02:38:15.610 --> 02:38:17.590]  I mean, Israel brags in the Jerusalem Post.
[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:19.590]  I'd cover this 25, 30 years ago.
[02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:20.569]  People say, why are you being anti-Israel?
[02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:21.909]  I'm like, I'm anti-evil.
[02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:24.909]  When a country's doing wrong, I don't hate the Jews or hate Israel.
[02:38:24.909 --> 02:38:26.170]  I hate the bad things they do.
[02:38:26.250 --> 02:38:28.469]  I hate the bad things we do when we have bad leadership.
[02:38:28.809 --> 02:38:29.850]  But now it's all the news.
[02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:30.190]  Well, yeah.
[02:38:30.969 --> 02:38:32.190]  Why we created Hamas?
[02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:38.649]  We didn't want the Muslims to have, you know, a mainstream government because then we couldn't destroy them.
[02:38:38.829 --> 02:38:39.930]  We want their property.
[02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:49.600]  So, you know, we We don't want Muslims in here that want to have swimming pools and girls in bikinis and, you know, nice hotels and, you know, all the stuff that people over there already had.
[02:38:49.819 --> 02:38:54.260]  No, we're going to put Hamas in charge and make women wear burqas and do all this stuff.
[02:38:54.459 --> 02:38:57.899]  And then when they get too big, we're going to blow them up.
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:02.540]  And so they build up the enemy, blow up the enemy, build up the enemy, blow up the enemy.
[02:39:02.719 --> 02:39:08.819]  And now they're already saying, oh, we'll be fighting forever in, you know, Syria now with this new group that's the Liberators.
[02:39:08.959 --> 02:39:09.899]  I mean, that is sick.
[02:39:13.049 --> 02:39:19.450]  And that's the problem with us pointing out that these guys are al-Qaeda, because as we do that, they're going to use that against us.
[02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:24.129]  They've set it up so that there's nothing we can do.
[02:39:26.549 --> 02:39:29.229]  The odds are stacked against us, essentially.
[02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:40.709]  Yeah, you replace Assad, who they say is the devil, with Al-Qaeda, and then now they know the public has a short memory, and then forever Israel and Turkey are attacking Syria to keep it down because, well, Al-Qaeda's in charge.
[02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:42.750]  And then nobody says, but you put them in.
[02:39:47.670 --> 02:40:07.250]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry because- We all saw this coming, and even today, the U.S. B-52s flew 92 sorties in Syria, bombing like crazy, and their excuse was we were bombing ISIS. When have we seen ISIS in Syria lately?
[02:40:07.829 --> 02:40:08.829]  Why now?
[02:40:08.969 --> 02:40:12.950]  Why now bomb ISIS? Where's ISIS? Where were they?
[02:40:13.209 --> 02:40:14.729]  So it's a made up story.
[02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:17.409]  They don't even have to have an ISIS to bomb.
[02:40:17.649 --> 02:40:23.930]  They just need to claim they're bombing ISIS. So the question now is, is the US gonna pull out of Syria?
[02:40:24.889 --> 02:40:26.110]  That is the question.
[02:40:26.430 --> 02:40:27.430]  Is Trump gonna pull out of Syria?
[02:40:27.489 --> 02:40:31.430]  Well, I hope Trump does, but Biden's already saying he wants to send US troops.
[02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:34.250]  I'm sure you saw that press conference or that announcement last night.
[02:40:35.250 --> 02:40:37.409]  He wants to send U.S. troops?
[02:40:37.569 --> 02:40:38.989]  Yep, and quote aid, yeah.
[02:40:40.010 --> 02:40:47.049]  I heard that he wants to, that the U.S. said we're not going anywhere, but I didn't realize that we're going to send more.
[02:40:47.049 --> 02:40:52.750]  Well, that's what Trump has said, but no, Biden's like, we need to send aid, including humanitarian, that means troops.
[02:40:53.770 --> 02:40:55.209]  Oh my God, well...
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:58.799]  They really want to balkanize Syria.
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:08.459]  When you see U.S. troops in Syria, that means that they want to take a piece of it, and they want to carve out everything east of the Euphrates, because that's what the audit union plan says.
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.340]  Sure, and then they have that base to operate into Iraq.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:10.840]  Stay there.
[02:41:10.899 --> 02:41:12.000]  Do a few more minutes with us.
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:15.479]  I want to play some really sickening historic clips when we come back.
[02:41:15.959 --> 02:41:16.659]  Stay right there.
[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:18.379]  Syrian girl, everybody should follow her.

[02:45:00.239 --> 02:45:01.299]  That's just the sea moss.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:14.139]  Now let's look at bladder rack, thyroid support, anti-inflammatory, digestive aid, rich antioxidants, skin health, weight management, joint support, improves vision, and so much more.
[02:45:14.299 --> 02:45:15.500]  Now let's look at burdock root.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:28.700]  Detoxifies the body, rich in antioxidants, improves skin health, supports digestive health, boost immune system function, balances blood sugar, anti-inflammatory, supports circulation, and again, so much more.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.500]  And it's not just Ultimate CMOS Formula that's amazing at the AlexJonesStore.com.

[02:46:44.180 --> 02:46:47.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:50.860]  We're now into hour number four of this Monday, December 9th.
[02:46:50.959 --> 02:46:52.319]  I don't believe this is going to happen.
[02:46:52.340 --> 02:47:04.020]  I can't believe it's going to happen, but the judge could rule that the sale to Michael Bloomberg, that's who owns it, runs the Everytown group that in the documents owns The Onion and is their front group, will shut us down tonight.
[02:47:05.399 --> 02:47:07.959]  The hearing is ongoing right now in Houston.
[02:47:08.819 --> 02:47:13.879]  No reason for me to be there because it's all in the documents, it's all in the admissions, what they did, the bed rigging, all of it.
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:15.739]  So I'm here on air.
[02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:24.799]  And if we're here and we're listening and the judge says the cell goes through, Chris Murray, the U.S. trustee, says he will shut us down immediately.
[02:47:25.260 --> 02:47:27.079]  Cut the power, cut the internet.
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.680]  So I intend, if that happens, to stay on until...
[02:47:31.879 --> 02:47:37.120]  His people, and they got the auctioneer operatives are in the building right through that wall right there.
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:38.840]  They're just working for him.
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:39.680]  They're not bad.
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:43.180]  They're just mercenaries in the information war.
[02:47:43.319 --> 02:47:45.600]  And so I'll be here when they turn the show off.
[02:47:45.719 --> 02:47:48.260]  I will fight right to the end.
[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:51.159]  I will go down with the ship, and we'll just go over to the Alex Jones Network after that.
[02:47:51.559 --> 02:47:53.559]  But these colors don't run.
[02:47:54.319 --> 02:47:56.399]  Getting back to Syria, girl, I'll hold you in the next segment.
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:57.559]  Some stations don't carry this one.
[02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:58.860]  But I want to ask you this.
[02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:02.370]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:48:02.489 --> 02:48:04.190]  You know, so far he's doing the things he said.
[02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:08.629]  He cut 24 billion through the Secretary, through the Speaker of the House last week.
[02:48:09.049 --> 02:48:14.190]  He's instructed his new Secretary of Defense, his new National Security Advisor to de-escalate.
[02:48:14.329 --> 02:48:17.370]  He said that yesterday and over the weekend with Zelensky.
[02:48:17.450 --> 02:48:18.270]  Zelensky said no.
[02:48:18.629 --> 02:48:24.309]  This new Northern group made up of 12 countries in Europe, led by the UK, says they're going to continue the war regardless.
[02:48:36.610 --> 02:48:38.209]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:43.590]  I think Trump should pull out of Syria, obviously, number one.
[02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:57.389]  There's going to be a chaotic situation if HTS or Al-Qaeda or the rebels cross east of the Euphrates and fight the Kurdish communist groups.
[02:48:57.969 --> 02:49:02.090]  Turkey is part of NATO, so he wanted to pull out already.
[02:49:02.649 --> 02:49:04.590]  Syria should be a whole country.
[02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:06.969]  It shouldn't have pieces cut off and carved out.
[02:49:07.319 --> 02:49:11.100]  And they shouldn't be using excuses to make that happen.
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:12.540]  Especially one of the oldest countries on earth.
[02:49:13.319 --> 02:49:14.799]  Yes, thank you so much.
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:21.879]  Oldest civilization, the first Neolithic farmers, the first phonetic alphabet, all from Syria.
[02:49:22.100 --> 02:49:27.139]  So he also should It's fire in Ukraine.
[02:49:27.379 --> 02:49:48.719]  The war in Ukraine, and now Russia is not completely weakened because it still has the base in Tartus, but it has less of a foothold in Syria than it did before because now there's Turkish influence and Turkey's part of NATO. And so their presence in Syria is almost beholden to NATO now.
[02:49:48.879 --> 02:49:53.129]  And so they're in a much more precarious A negotiating position.
[02:49:53.309 --> 02:49:59.149]  And there's going to be people that are going to try to take advantage of that and say, you know what, we can just go and steamroll Russia now.
[02:49:59.329 --> 02:50:03.790]  We can just, like, completely go all the way to Moscow.
[02:50:04.049 --> 02:50:06.010]  And that's going to lead to nuclear war.
[02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:13.989]  So he should really push against that and force Zelensky to a ceasefire.
[02:50:14.170 --> 02:50:16.790]  But unfortunately, what you have to understand is a few things.
[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:21.739]  In my view, the NATO forces, they don't want to give up.
[02:50:21.860 --> 02:50:27.639]  There's a lot of people that are going to ignore Trump, just like they ignored him when he was asked to pull out of Syria.
[02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:32.180]  They might even try to assassinate him again because he's trying to do that.
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:36.260]  Zelensky is a very good friend of Netanyahu.
[02:50:37.159 --> 02:50:41.760]  He said he wants to make Ukraine into a second Israel.
[02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:48.090]  It's possible that the whole war in Ukraine was designed to tie Russia's hands in Syria.
[02:50:48.549 --> 02:50:50.530]  And maybe that's why they're going to cease fire.
[02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:55.370]  But I also think that they want to make sure that the Russians can never help Syria again.
[02:50:56.329 --> 02:50:59.629]  And so that's probably why they're going to march on.
[02:50:59.750 --> 02:51:00.850]  And that's another question.
[02:51:01.229 --> 02:51:01.709]  Absolutely.
[02:51:01.829 --> 02:51:03.329]  What's going to happen to the Russian fleet there?
[02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:06.180]  At the moment, they're saying they're going to stay.
[02:51:06.319 --> 02:51:13.579]  So they've made some kind of arrangement with the new regime, I suppose, and the Turks, who control them, to stay.
[02:51:13.819 --> 02:51:18.700]  And I hope they do remain, because they offer some protection from- Well, that's right.
[02:51:18.819 --> 02:51:24.500]  Erdogan wants to still keep Russia as a somewhat- Friendly, so NATO doesn't double-cross Turkey.
[02:51:24.739 --> 02:51:26.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:26.459 --> 02:51:27.639]  60 seconds with Syrian girl.
[02:51:27.739 --> 02:51:28.360]  Very smart lady.
[02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:36.079]  Alright, I wanted to play a final clip for a really smart lady who's a journalist and scientist and expert on...
[02:51:37.889 --> 02:51:39.690]  Geopolitics in Syria, and that's Syrian girl.
[02:51:40.129 --> 02:51:46.409]  And then I'm going to get to some really important information that we haven't hit yet, but I wanted to play a clip.
[02:51:46.930 --> 02:51:58.629]  Remember George W. Bush, three or four years after they admitted no WMDs, killed hundreds of thousands more Iraqis on top of the millions that died from the decade of sanctions before that, or more.
[02:51:59.209 --> 02:52:04.709]  And he's up there at a dinner, press dinner, and he's just joking about no WMDs under here, none under there.
[02:52:04.709 --> 02:52:06.510]  It's so funny.
[02:52:07.989 --> 02:52:16.770]  And Saddam was set up by the CIA as an assassin, worked for the US government, killed the Ba'athist president, was installed as a dictator, attacked Iran when he was told.
[02:52:17.629 --> 02:52:20.129]  Told to go ahead and invade Kuwait that they wouldn't get involved.
[02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:22.030]  Wink, wink, do it.
[02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:24.430]  And then they set him up.
[02:52:25.090 --> 02:52:26.030]  That's evil.
[02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:27.430]  Here's the clip.
[02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:30.209]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[02:52:39.209 --> 02:52:45.870]  As you can tell from the look on Andy Card's face, we've become a little concerned about the Vice President lately.
[02:52:48.129 --> 02:52:52.190]  Whenever you ask him a question, he replies, let's see what my little friend says.
[02:53:01.350 --> 02:53:02.610]  But we get along well.
[02:53:02.729 --> 02:53:08.829]  Here I am saying, Dick, if the Hunan Palace doesn't get lunch here in four minutes, we're going out.
[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:13.680]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:23.979]  Maybe under here.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:31.559]  Do you think people like that are gonna rob you, America?
[02:53:31.739 --> 02:53:33.659]  Do you feel good having scum like that?
[02:53:34.909 --> 02:53:37.450]  Pray for President Trump, because Putin's right, they're going to try to kill him again.
[02:53:37.610 --> 02:53:43.629]  Syrian girl, I want to give you four or five minutes here to just, you're really a smart lady, to talk about any other key points you think need to be made here.
[02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:59.590]  I would say beware of what you hear, because if you remember after the fall of Gaddafi, there was all of this atrocity propaganda that came out.
[02:54:00.579 --> 02:54:05.719]  Do you remember the 40 beheaded, burned babies that Israelis came up with?
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:14.379]  All of these allegations that they made that were fruitless were not based in reality and were spread across the media.
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:22.040]  Because those who make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:25.180]  That is the purpose, that's the agenda behind such things.
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:29.180]  So please take everything with a grain of salt.
[02:54:29.559 --> 02:54:31.379]  Please don't forget about us.
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:33.000]  We're still fighting.
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:39.540]  Even though Israel is taking everything at the moment, the spirit of resistance is still there.
[02:54:39.719 --> 02:54:41.139]  And we will rise again.
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:42.200]  We're going to rise again.
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:45.520]  And we will somehow reunite the country.
[02:54:45.959 --> 02:54:51.600]  I know it seems like pie in the sky at the moment, but I'm not going to stop fighting.
[02:54:51.879 --> 02:54:53.040]  I'm not going to stop speaking.
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:58.200]  The show goes on, I suppose, and we keep going forward.
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:07.000]  The fight is now really, though, the front lines are inside the United States, not necessarily in Syria anymore.
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:10.479]  And that's your torch to carry.
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:19.760]  Because the evil forces, they have taken control of all the major powers in the world.
[02:55:20.500 --> 02:55:37.760]  And they're using them to Basically spread this neoliberal, woke, LGBT, transing the kids, and using that to create wars.
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:42.440]  That's going to be our major front going forward.
[02:55:42.659 --> 02:55:46.819]  And I would love to be able to support you on that front in any way that I can.
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:57.120]  Maybe remind people of what else is happening in Syria in the future, any atrocities that are committed, any excuses that are used.
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:59.799]  We don't know which way this thing is going to go.
[02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:05.540]  So we're going to need to continue to talk about it and just never stop.
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:09.760]  I guess I would love to answer any questions that you have if I can answer them.
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:15.899]  Well, Syrian Girl, we'll get updates at Partisan Girl on X with you as this unfolds.
[02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:18.860]  We get you on more than every six months or so.
[02:56:18.959 --> 02:56:23.780]  God bless you, and we're praying for peace, and we're so sorry for what our globalist occupiers have done to your nation.
[02:56:23.879 --> 02:56:24.299]  God bless you.
[02:56:25.569 --> 02:56:26.709]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:56:26.850 --> 02:56:27.510]  God bless you too.
[02:56:27.850 --> 02:56:28.250]  Thank you.
[02:56:28.370 --> 02:56:30.649]  And I'm so glad you're still on the air.
[02:56:30.850 --> 02:56:33.790]  You know, that's the thing that amazes me.
[02:56:34.209 --> 02:56:36.649]  So, you know, you keep going strong.
[02:56:37.149 --> 02:56:43.450]  Be like, you know, we fought hard till 13 years, but I think you're going to outlast us.
[02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:44.629]  I'm happy for you.
[02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:46.930]  And please, your voice is very needed.
[02:56:47.450 --> 02:56:47.909]  Thank you.
[02:56:48.190 --> 02:56:48.709]  God bless you.
[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:53.309]  Look, I'm still on air because of the supporters, the listeners, the viewers, the crew.
[02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:56.629]  I'm still on air because God is in charge.
[02:56:56.850 --> 02:56:59.590]  And you notice the globalists are still able to cause all these wars, all those evil.
[02:57:00.030 --> 02:57:01.629]  That's in their desperation to stay in power.
[02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:03.670]  And the more they do, the more opposition forms.
[02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:05.389]  So we're winning battles.
[02:57:05.549 --> 02:57:06.690]  We're going to win the war.
[02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:08.129]  But we've got to stay focused.
[02:57:09.209 --> 02:57:11.750]  Now, I was watching last night after I got off air.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:25.159]  I got home about 7 o'clock, started watching Chase Geyser's second hour, and I really thought the intro to the second hour, he did a great job defining globalism and knowing your enemy versus what we stand for.
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:27.120]  So I want to air about 15 minutes of that.
[02:57:27.239 --> 02:57:34.659]  I want to come back with the World War III news and more on General Flynn saying today in the first hour, we are in World War III and unpacking that.
[02:57:34.899 --> 02:57:36.920]  So stay with us for that information.
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:37.719]  And please remember...
[02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:43.989]  The Alex Jones store, with the incredible supplements, the Patriot gear and all of it, is not owned by the globalists.
[02:57:44.030 --> 02:57:46.370]  If InfoWars is shut down today, it's the court hearings right now.
[02:57:48.149 --> 02:57:49.829]  We still have our sponsors, the Alex Jones store.
[02:57:49.909 --> 02:57:51.049]  It'll be critical of the Alex Jones network.
[02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:58.690]  We also have drjonesnaturals.com with the corset and highest quality, the CoQ10, nice little foundational energy, the fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:57:58.709 --> 02:58:00.750]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:58:00.850 --> 02:58:01.750]  That's not owned by me.
[02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:03.170]  Bad guys can't get that.
[02:58:03.290 --> 02:58:04.170]  That's keto staying on air.
[02:58:04.229 --> 02:58:05.270]  Plus, the products are amazing.
[02:58:06.159 --> 02:58:09.760]  D.R. Jones, just short for doctor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:12.819]  My dad's a great supplement company right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:14.120]  But Infowars is amazing.
[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:16.420]  It goes on no matter what happens to this building or the website.
[02:58:16.659 --> 02:58:19.520]  We're going to keep fighting, but only if you stand with us and support us.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:20.719]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:58:20.940 --> 02:58:22.319]  Here's Chase Geiser's excellent report.
[02:58:23.159 --> 02:58:43.129]  So what we're seeing right before our eyes is a major victory for populism and national sovereignty juxtaposed to a hybrid model Of 1984 and Brave New World, all backed by a hybrid model of fascism and Marxism.
[02:58:44.149 --> 02:58:57.229]  Because keep in mind, if you want to explain what globalism is as a political philosophy, as a movement, globalism is the hybrid model of Marxism and fascism.
[02:58:57.670 --> 02:59:02.069]  In the 1920s and the 1930s, the fascists fought in the streets against the communists.
[02:59:03.450 --> 02:59:07.250]  Hitler famously opposed to the Marxists, advocated for the fascists, obviously.
[02:59:07.829 --> 02:59:15.110]  Literally brawling in the streets, showing up to each other's rallies like the Proud Boys in Antifa, fighting each other, beating each other, killing each other in some instances.
[02:59:16.649 --> 02:59:28.389]  But since World War II has ended, We've seen this infiltration of Marxism that understands now that Marxism is an inferior economic system.
[02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:40.350]  So it has taken the strengths of fascism and top-down leadership and merged it with Marxism, which is this collectivist philosophy with this fascist economic control and military control into this philosophy of globalism.
[02:59:40.450 --> 02:59:46.430]  And it's funding all of academia through its Marxist theology, through its fascist funding.
[02:59:48.020 --> 02:59:56.719]  To create this hybrid of 1984 and Brave New World right before our eyes, and suddenly we're seeing massive UAPs all over the sky.
[02:59:56.899 --> 03:00:10.200]  Suddenly we're seeing this all of a sudden development of artificial intelligence on a massive scale, where you have the likes of the most brilliant man in the world, Elon Musk, terrified at the ramifications of what happens.
[03:00:11.290 --> 03:00:25.969]  If AGI is not created thoughtfully, if this power, if this technology is wielded only by a political class without decentralization to hold it in check, and the deep state is panicking.
[03:00:26.629 --> 03:00:27.709]  They're pulling out all the stops.
[03:00:27.829 --> 03:00:31.049]  They're doing everything they can to escalate as much as possible before January 20th.
[03:00:31.149 --> 03:00:34.729]  Because they know if Trump gets wise to what is going on, he's gonna put a stop to it.
[03:00:34.729 --> 03:00:42.989]  And that's why we see the rats, the Republicans against Trump, trying to interfere and create obstacles with all these amazing cabinet picks.
[03:00:44.010 --> 03:00:46.250]  Cash and Egg Seth and others.
[03:00:46.770 --> 03:00:48.610]  That's why we see the leftists panicking.
[03:00:52.409 --> 03:00:56.209]  And it's why we even see Russia trying to warn us.
[03:00:59.770 --> 03:01:05.590]  About what escalation looks like because it could be the death of humanity or worse, the subjugation of humanity.
[03:01:06.030 --> 03:01:24.010]  I mean, I would rather die in World War III nuclear genocide than live under the subjugation that they are currently designing and building covertly in the halls of the deep state to implement as soon as possible under the guise of some international emergency.
[03:01:24.190 --> 03:01:27.590]  And they keep acting like we're dictators, like we're despots.
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:41.700]  Patriots are right wing, and I'm sure you could think of a couple, but over 90% of the dictators of the last 100 years have been left wing dictators.
[03:01:42.139 --> 03:01:46.899]  I know people say that Hitler was right wing or Mussolini was right wing, but he wasn't.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:47.959]  I mean, he was a socialist.
[03:01:48.319 --> 03:01:49.979]  It was the National Socialist Party.
[03:01:51.629 --> 03:01:54.290]  National Socialist Workers' Party, does that sound very right-wing to you?
[03:01:54.450 --> 03:01:59.209]  If you look at some of the policies, economic policies, domestic policies that took place under Hitler, this is a left-wing guy.
[03:01:59.350 --> 03:02:01.510]  He wasn't a Marxist, but he was certainly a socialist.
[03:02:05.770 --> 03:02:14.170]  Mussolini about his talks of nationalism was totally about government spending and government expansion, trying to rebuild the ancient Rome of old, the glory of the Roman Empire.
[03:02:17.559 --> 03:02:21.920]  But this time, instead of in marble and concrete, positively Soviet, even though it was Italian.
[03:02:24.959 --> 03:02:27.500]  And then we see all these dictators throughout the world, they're all left-wing.
[03:02:27.639 --> 03:02:30.780]  I mean, even Putin, former KGB for the Soviet Union.
[03:02:32.079 --> 03:02:33.299]  I don't know that he's a communist.
[03:02:34.909 --> 03:02:38.170]  But he's not exactly right wing just because he believes in the Russian Orthodox Church.
[03:02:38.329 --> 03:02:38.969]  Does that make him right wing?
[03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:44.170]  All these dictators, all these people that we accuse of being despots have always been left wing.
[03:02:44.309 --> 03:02:47.989]  They've always advocated for more government, bigger government, collectivism.
[03:02:49.850 --> 03:02:56.629]  And yet they gaslight us over and over again by saying it's our fault or it's our party that seeks dictatorship.
[03:02:56.889 --> 03:03:07.309]  We don't seek dictatorship, we just seek relentless victory over and over again against the likes of you, against the likes of the left, which want to subjugate and mutilate us.
[03:03:08.409 --> 03:03:17.069]  And I don't know if depopulation is intentional or not, seems to me that it is, but that's exactly what their anti-human philosophy is, whether it's through climate change, whether it's through the transgender stuff.
[03:03:17.170 --> 03:03:23.139]  I mean, the reason they lost It's not because they didn't double down hard enough on identity politics.
[03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:29.159]  It's not because they didn't have a chance to run a candidate early enough, like Carville states.
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:30.940]  It's because of clips like this.
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:36.120]  This is clip number 34. One year old daughter told us she was transgender.
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:41.620]  Let's watch clip number 34. What motivated you to come out here today?
[03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:49.059]  We're supporting our child Violet and her access to the medical care that she needs.
[03:03:51.730 --> 03:03:55.670]  Yeah, we're here for her rights and her ability to be who she is.
[03:03:56.329 --> 03:04:00.510]  And she's not going to let anybody silence her and we're not going to stand in her way.
[03:04:01.290 --> 03:04:02.290]  What state are you from?
[03:04:02.610 --> 03:04:03.209]  Arizona.
[03:04:03.690 --> 03:04:10.170]  Okay, are you concerned about how this case would affect Arizona or do you think that would have an impact there?
[03:04:10.629 --> 03:04:24.569]  Yes, 100% we're concerned and we've discussed having to move which we don't want to do but Violet comes first and her medical care and her medical needs come first so we'll see what happens.
[03:04:25.090 --> 03:04:29.229]  In what age do you think most trans kids determine that they're trans?
[03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:34.920]  Violet told us when she was one and a half.
[03:04:35.260 --> 03:04:37.479]  She's been telling us since she could speak.
[03:04:37.739 --> 03:04:39.280]  All right, I've got a daughter who's one and a half.
[03:04:39.399 --> 03:04:42.899]  She is not making any sophisticated arguments that she's the opposite gender.
[03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:45.420]  She's not even making any arguments that she is the gender that she is.
[03:04:45.559 --> 03:04:46.920]  She's just a little girl having fun.
[03:04:49.299 --> 03:04:53.680]  And what you're seeing there are parents who are reading into their child.
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:59.639]  They're projecting onto their child what they want because they want to be able to go out and virtue signal.
[03:05:00.629 --> 03:05:07.430]  That they're all about rights and they're not dogmatic or establishment or traditional, they're progressive.
[03:05:10.649 --> 03:05:22.670]  I mean, this woke mind virus, the real pandemic is so intrusive, so universal, so infectious, so powerful.
[03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:32.989]  That it convinces parents of their own children to sterilize their children and then brag about it without even batting an eye.
[03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:43.270]  If you go back to World War II and listen to some speeches of Goebbels and others about what was happening with the Holocaust.
[03:05:46.170 --> 03:05:50.649]  They emphasize the importance of being discreet about it, of hiding it.
[03:05:50.809 --> 03:05:52.270]  They even say that they're not proud of it.
[03:05:52.290 --> 03:05:53.770]  They just felt that it was necessary.
[03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:54.729]  It was evil, of course.
[03:05:55.209 --> 03:05:57.590]  But they felt that it was a necessary evil, right?
[03:05:57.729 --> 03:05:59.489]  And I'm not an apologist for the Nazis whatsoever.
[03:05:59.489 --> 03:06:01.010]  I'm very much opposed to fascists.
[03:06:02.190 --> 03:06:03.829]  And what happened during the Holocaust?
[03:06:06.760 --> 03:06:16.260]  But now we have a situation where people are so infected and sick and contaminated that they want to render their children unable for the rest of their lives to have children of their own.
[03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:23.479]  And they're bragging about it to reporters so that their friend group on Instagram knows how virtuous they are.
[03:06:23.579 --> 03:06:28.879]  I mean, this is the most disgusting, vain, superficial thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:35.680]  And I understand that there are people that have children who suffer from gender dysphoria.
[03:06:35.899 --> 03:06:42.040]  I can't imagine what it's like to have your 13 year old kid come home and say that they identify as the opposite gender, to be caught off guard like that.
[03:06:42.540 --> 03:06:45.739]  But I know the solution isn't to just lean into that.
[03:06:46.680 --> 03:06:49.579]  If somebody's got bulimia, you don't encourage them to purge.
[03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:53.159]  If they got anorexia, you don't hide all the food from them.
[03:06:54.180 --> 03:06:57.440]  If they're depressed, you don't talk to them about the benefits of suicide.
[03:06:58.379 --> 03:07:01.620]  If they're schizophrenic, you don't tell them that the voices that they're hearing are real.
[03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:05.420]  And if they're suffering from gender dysphoria, you don't tell them that that's okay and totally normal.
[03:07:06.479 --> 03:07:07.239]  It's an illness.
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:20.239]  And like I said last week, I'll say it again, I cannot think of a single mental illness that mental health professionals, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, and others.
[03:07:20.459 --> 03:07:30.319]  I cannot think of a single mental illness that has successfully been cured by the mental health industry at all since its establishment under Freud, you could argue.
[03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:43.309]  And so when they propose such a radical treatment for a mental illness, gender dysphoria, who in their right mind would possibly take it seriously?
[03:07:46.049 --> 03:07:47.709]  It makes no sense to me whatsoever.
[03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:51.709]  This is why populism is waking up worldwide.
[03:07:52.170 --> 03:07:55.549]  This is why Trump was elected instead of Biden or Kamala.
[03:07:56.370 --> 03:07:59.350]  This is why the leftists lost the House of Representatives.
[03:07:59.549 --> 03:08:01.049]  It's why the leftists lost the Senate.
[03:08:03.640 --> 03:08:18.459]  Inherently understand the real disease that has infected the minds of our people, the real psychological operation that has taken place, whether it's China through TikTok manipulating people, or whether it's intentionally our own deep state manipulating people, or whether it's Disney manipulating people.
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:20.959]  Something is very wrong.
[03:08:21.319 --> 03:08:38.129]  And not only is it a problem that they've established this precedence of Insurmountable levels of gender dysphoria occurring, but they've simultaneously advocated for a solution to that problem that is even more harmful.
[03:08:38.629 --> 03:08:46.469]  Just like they did with COVID, where they manufactured COVID in a lab, where they funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan, where Fauci lied about it.
[03:08:46.610 --> 03:08:48.889]  They created the virus, they created the problem.
[03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:50.969]  It was a deadlier virus than the average flu.
[03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:54.879]  Not as deadly as they made it out to be, but certainly deadly and dangerous.
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:59.979]  They created the problem, and then the solution that they advocated was even more harmful.
[03:09:00.159 --> 03:09:07.700]  Just as they did with 9-11, where they created the problem of a terrorist attack happening in the United States, and the solution they advocated, the Patriot Act, was even more harmful.
[03:09:08.299 --> 03:09:13.600]  The wars they advocated in the war on terror to solve the problem that they created was even more terrible.
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:22.239]  It's created unprecedented instability in the Middle East throughout basically every country and everyone celebrated in 2010, 2011, the Arab Spring.
[03:09:22.719 --> 03:09:25.219]  Finally, these people are rising up against their regimes.
[03:09:25.559 --> 03:09:33.000]  Twitter was bragging about dropping guides to people on how to make improvised explosive devices, how to connect to the internet, how to use VPNs, things of that nature.
[03:09:33.809 --> 03:09:40.409]  They were so gung-ho and excited about advocating this conflict in the region, and now we're on the precipice of World War III because of it?
[03:09:40.549 --> 03:09:41.350]  We celebrate it?
[03:09:41.569 --> 03:09:45.610]  Every problem that happens, we create, and then every solution is even worse.
[03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:52.829]  Can we not see that the only real solution is to stop funding and empowering our government to do basically anything at all?
[03:09:54.079 --> 03:09:59.340]  The only thing they should be doing is protecting the border and enforcing contracts and protecting private property rights.
[03:09:59.559 --> 03:10:03.040]  Everything else is superficial, wasteful, and harmful.
[03:10:03.239 --> 03:10:04.100]  Frankly, anti-human.
[03:10:05.620 --> 03:10:12.159]  If they just did the three things they were supposed to do, three things which they refused to do, instead of everything else that they do do.
[03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:14.790]  They just did the three things they were supposed to do.
[03:10:14.930 --> 03:10:15.850]  That would be enough.
[03:10:16.049 --> 03:10:16.950]  Everything else would flourish.
[03:10:17.209 --> 03:10:24.729]  We saw the greatest amount of prosperity and freedom and growth happen over the course of the last 300 years because this was the freest country.
[03:10:24.909 --> 03:10:27.329]  This country had the most cultural consensus.
[03:10:27.569 --> 03:10:29.350]  It had the belief in private property rights.
[03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:30.989]  It believed in things like capitalism.
[03:10:31.209 --> 03:10:34.649]  And it celebrated things like success instead of condemning them.
[03:10:37.450 --> 03:10:40.110]  Eric Holder this week, I don't know if you guys can find the tweet.
[03:10:41.379 --> 03:10:45.680]  He tweeted something and it started, when I hear the word billionaire, please find the tweet and throw it on the screen.
[03:10:47.139 --> 03:10:50.079]  And he was just, this is the fast and furious guy.
[03:10:50.159 --> 03:10:54.659]  This is the guy who disproportionately audited conservative individuals and conservative groups under President Obama.
[03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:15.379]  He derides billionaires as inherently corrupt or lucky and gives them No recognition or acknowledgement that maybe part at least of the reason that they were successful is because they created something incredibly valuable or because they're incredibly talented.
[03:11:16.520 --> 03:11:29.860]  I mean, if it's so easy to become a billionaire just by lying and cheating, like these leftist claim, then we'd have way more billionaires.
[03:11:30.610 --> 03:11:32.049]  I could lie and cheat all day.
[03:11:32.170 --> 03:11:33.430]  I'm telling you folks, I'm not gonna be a billionaire.
[03:11:33.549 --> 03:11:35.030]  Maybe one day I'll be a multi-millionaire.
[03:11:35.250 --> 03:11:37.690]  I think I have the capacity to make millions of dollars.
[03:11:37.870 --> 03:11:39.309]  I am never going to be a billionaire.
[03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:40.690]  I just don't have it in me.
[03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:42.270]  I've learned that about myself.
[03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:43.610]  I'm not gonna be a billionaire.
[03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:51.090]  I'm not gonna create some new technology or some new app or some new company that's gonna explode into billions upon billions upon billions of dollars because I'm not smart enough.
[03:11:51.090 --> 03:11:52.010]  I'm not talented enough.
[03:11:52.010 --> 03:11:52.770]  I'm not driven enough.
[03:11:52.889 --> 03:11:55.510]  I'm not passionate enough about whatever thing that is that's gonna be the big thing.
[03:11:56.659 --> 03:12:00.760]  I'm just passionate about freedom of speech, so I'm operating here to try to keep Alex Jones on the air.
[03:12:02.079 --> 03:12:08.040]  But we have the Eric Holders, and we have this whole political class coming out and shaming success.
[03:12:08.319 --> 03:12:22.180]  The antithesis says, I'm tired of the word billionaire, and even more tired of them, and tired of the increasingly accepted notion that they have some special skills or insights simply because they know how to legitimately or illegitimately accumulate money.
[03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:23.959]  They ain't all that.
[03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:25.680]  What a dumbass.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:29.799]  Don't get me wrong, there are some billionaires that are corrupt and sick.
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:31.399]  Bill Gates, definitely corrupt and sick.
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:38.520]  The reason he's a billionaire is not because he's corrupt and sick, it's because he was the CEO of Windows in the dawn of the personal computer.
[03:12:40.020 --> 03:12:44.899]  And he's used that wealth to sabotage all that is good in the world.
[03:12:47.319 --> 03:12:54.280]  George Soros is as rich as he is because he was incredibly talented at manipulating the stock market and currencies in other countries.
[03:12:54.399 --> 03:12:55.159]  Yes, he was corrupt.
[03:12:55.399 --> 03:12:56.139]  Yes, he is corrupt.
[03:12:56.299 --> 03:12:57.000]  Yes, he is evil.
[03:12:58.020 --> 03:13:01.219]  But you don't just get a billion dollars because you're corrupt or evil.
[03:13:01.360 --> 03:13:02.719]  You also have to have some talent.
[03:13:05.180 --> 03:13:08.420]  Adolf Hitler didn't become the Fuhrer just because he was evil and corrupt.
[03:13:08.620 --> 03:13:09.860]  Yes, he was evil and corrupt.
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:11.979]  But man, could he give a speech?
[03:13:15.079 --> 03:13:24.520]  They want to eradicate success as a virtue because they want us not to have any success because they know that if we fail, they can exploit our failure and make us dependent on them.
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:34.020]  This is all part of their sick philosophy that sterilizes us, neutralizes us, and finally subjugates us all while they build the infrastructure of a one world government around them.
[03:13:34.869 --> 03:13:41.489]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[03:13:41.989 --> 03:13:43.290]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[03:13:43.409 --> 03:13:44.729]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:45.149]  Thank you, sir.
[03:13:45.690 --> 03:13:49.290]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:13:49.409 --> 03:13:51.950]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:55.870]  My dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:13:56.049 --> 03:13:59.870]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:14:00.209 --> 03:14:02.809]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[03:14:02.989 --> 03:14:04.629]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:14:04.909 --> 03:14:06.530]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:14:06.569 --> 03:14:07.670]  And we're finally winning.
[03:14:07.889 --> 03:14:19.180]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you, To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:29.360]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:30.879]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:37.159]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[03:14:38.049 --> 03:14:44.889]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:14:45.370 --> 03:14:46.610]  The supplements are there.
[03:14:46.770 --> 03:14:47.389]  They're great.
[03:14:47.569 --> 03:14:48.729]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:14:48.750 --> 03:14:50.110]  He's put everything into it he has.
[03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:50.770]  They're incredible.
[03:14:51.049 --> 03:15:00.709]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.

[03:15:02.879 --> 03:15:04.100]  Please support us.

[03:15:25.120 --> 03:15:26.260]  And my dad...
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:32.860]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:35.139]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[03:15:35.319 --> 03:15:37.819]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:42.340]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.979]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:15:44.159 --> 03:15:44.760]  He's a fighter.
[03:15:44.879 --> 03:15:45.739]  Hell, he's my dad.
[03:15:45.879 --> 03:15:46.840]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:15:47.079 --> 03:15:48.459]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:15:49.149 --> 03:15:56.690]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:15:56.850 --> 03:15:59.530]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:59.670 --> 03:16:00.610]  It's about my parents.
[03:16:01.229 --> 03:16:06.670]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted me.
[03:16:07.170 --> 03:16:10.229]  So, please support the info war today.
[03:16:10.530 --> 03:16:12.329]  Support my mother and my father.
[03:16:12.489 --> 03:16:15.309]  I'm asking it personally for you to do it now.
[03:16:15.569 --> 03:16:20.049]  And if 5% of the millions watching will go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[03:16:20.149 --> 03:16:25.670]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:16:25.729 --> 03:16:29.329]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[03:16:29.709 --> 03:16:32.989]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[03:16:33.090 --> 03:16:34.610]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[03:16:34.799 --> 03:16:46.059]  We're in World War III. I don't want anybody to think that there's this regional conflict in Europe that can be handled locally or this regional conflict in the Middle East that can be handled by Israel.
[03:16:46.799 --> 03:16:55.420]  CENTCOM, Central Command out of Tampa, just conducted, I think it was 200 strikes, if I got my numbers right, in the last 48 hours inside of Syria.
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:17:03.139]  So anybody that thinks we're not at war, and we're talking some of our largest, most capable Air Force platforms.
[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:04.719]  We're talking B-52s.
[03:17:05.459 --> 03:17:12.299]  Big, big, big-time capabilities inside of Syria and the types of targets that they were going after.
[03:17:12.680 --> 03:17:19.819]  And so there was an interesting article that I read early this morning, and I think that it's right.
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:27.260]  And essentially, the question was asked, who's winning the war in Syria, the Pentagon or the CIA? Because they're fighting each other.
[03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:28.700]  It appears they're fighting each other.
[03:17:28.780 --> 03:17:36.120]  It's like The CIA is backing, you know, one group and the Pentagon's in there fighting on behalf of, you know, of who?
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:37.379]  The American people?
[03:17:37.520 --> 03:17:38.280]  The American government?
[03:17:38.459 --> 03:17:40.479]  I mean, a declared war, declared what?
[03:17:40.739 --> 03:17:43.680]  I mean, we're not even certain who's in charge in the White House.
[03:17:43.940 --> 03:18:00.100]  And this is where, to take it all back to To the sort of the strategic view of what's happening, this is where, and I'm sitting at my sort of mobile command post here in Palm Beach right now, this is where I think Donald Trump is going to have to assemble his national security team,
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:03.639]  kind of a wartime cabinet right now.
[03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:06.590]  And make some decisions about who to call.
[03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:25.190]  And I know that he's in his trip over to Europe and some of the statements that you just, you know, said that he had made about NATO and, you know, that he has said, I think everybody needs to be paying very close attention to the kinds of actions that Trump is going to have to take, even before he takes over as president of the United States on the 20th of January.
[03:18:25.659 --> 03:18:30.079]  We are potentially walking into a trap, right?
[03:18:30.219 --> 03:18:31.680]  And I think that Trump understands that.
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:32.500]  I understand it.
[03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:34.719]  And I know others on his team understand it.
[03:18:35.170 --> 03:18:49.229]  And this trap is one where we stay into this cycle of war that only benefits the military industrial complex and benefits the intelligence community security state complex.
[03:18:49.430 --> 03:19:17.090]  And it takes the eye off of the ball of what Trump really wants to do from day one, which is start reformation of our government, start holding people accountable, start taking care of America first, We're good to go.
[03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:34.059]  None of which can happen on the 20th, all of which could happen in the first few months if we did not have these massive, massive distractions of these wars that we are involved in.
[03:19:34.139 --> 03:19:42.680]  I do think that one of the things that Trump needs to also make a statement about is he needs to tell this current administration to back off fomenting unrest in Eastern Europe.
[03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:43.920]  That has to happen.
[03:19:44.079 --> 03:19:46.440]  That's clear to me that that's going on.
[03:19:46.680 --> 03:19:50.620]  And it's probably elements inside of the US intelligence community that are doing that.
[03:19:50.719 --> 03:19:53.780]  I'm glad to see Trump talk about NATO the way he's talking about them.
[03:19:53.879 --> 03:19:55.100]  Basically, they got to foot the bill.
[03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:56.680]  They got to get involved.
[03:19:56.879 --> 03:20:07.620]  And also, I think the next big conversation that we're going to start to hear about is the UN because the United Nations also needs to be made to heal here a little bit because of the things that they're fomenting as well.
[03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:27.350]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, and the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the former top national security advisor to President Trump.
[03:20:27.729 --> 03:20:43.920]  General Flynn has graciously given us 20 minutes to break down the major global destabilization operations happening in Romania, Georgia, Syria, Who's involved?
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:45.000]  Where this is going?
[03:20:45.239 --> 03:20:51.680]  Trump saying in a big interview Saturday that he indeed is looking to get out of NATO, that he indeed is looking to cut the funding to Ukraine.
[03:20:51.739 --> 03:20:53.299]  We always put pressure on Zelensky.
[03:20:53.579 --> 03:20:59.659]  And it was in the news that when he met Zelensky, Zelensky said, no, the war will continue, even though the US funds 80 plus percent of it.
[03:21:00.479 --> 03:21:03.399]  Obviously, Speaker Johnson last Wednesday cut $24 billion.
[03:21:04.750 --> 03:21:07.389]  But Biden had another billion squirreled away that he gave.
[03:21:07.530 --> 03:21:18.209]  So you've got the president-elect with a mandate for peace, with the establishment deep state still hanging on, trying to escalate global conflict to hand Trump a giant disaster.
[03:21:18.209 --> 03:21:22.069]  That's confirmed, as General Flynn warned the day after the election when he was on with us.
[03:21:22.110 --> 03:21:27.090]  He said, this is my main concern, is they're going to start bombing Russia with attack comes in storm shadows.
[03:21:27.229 --> 03:21:28.129]  They did it a week later.
[03:21:29.010 --> 03:21:33.409]  And that got met by major global anger domestically as well.
[03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:36.409]  So now they've moved to these other destabilization operations.
[03:21:36.409 --> 03:21:40.309]  And I would predict they're going to have more coups, more overthrows.
[03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:45.690]  They are disregarding the election in Romania of an anti-war patriot.
[03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:50.549]  And General Flynn has the scoop on all of this.
[03:21:50.690 --> 03:22:00.549]  We'll also play some clips while he's on of Trump on Plans to get out of NATO if they don't start paying their fair share and stop starting wars and to cut the funding to Ukraine.
[03:22:00.709 --> 03:22:02.010]  So big announcements by Trump.
[03:22:02.149 --> 03:22:09.549]  He's also confirmed what Flynn said three weeks ago that he was hearing was gonna happen, that indeed they are gonna try to find the kidnapped kids.
[03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:10.850]  They are gonna go out to the deep state.
[03:22:11.010 --> 03:22:13.809]  They are gonna prosecute them for the things they've done, including Republicans.
[03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:17.549]  So Trump is boldly letting them know that he's coming for them.
[03:22:18.239 --> 03:22:19.600]  And this is historic.
[03:22:19.780 --> 03:22:23.940]  This is extremely dangerous, though, because the bad guys are gonna pull out all the stops.
[03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:25.479]  GeneralFlynn.com is the site.
[03:22:25.579 --> 03:22:27.219]  Everybody should bookmark and follow.
[03:22:27.420 --> 03:22:34.620]  Also, follow the General on X. General Flynn, thank you for the time, sir, to give us a briefing on these fast-moving developments.
[03:22:35.430 --> 03:22:37.270]  Yeah, it's very, very, it's incredible.
[03:22:37.549 --> 03:22:39.649]  Actually, monumental movements.
[03:22:39.930 --> 03:22:48.709]  And Alex, we've been talking about them actually for the last couple of weeks, certainly post-election, but, you know, really the last couple of years now.
[03:22:48.930 --> 03:23:04.530]  So I want everyone, everybody listening to understand that what is happening globally is intentionally designed to stop Trump's agenda, which is the America First agenda.
[03:23:05.219 --> 03:23:06.639]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:12.239]  You just highlighted this going after these 300,000 plus children that are missing.
[03:23:12.239 --> 03:23:16.260]  I just got off the phone with my great friend Tom Holman just a few minutes ago.
[03:23:17.149 --> 03:23:33.430]  And the domestic agenda that Donald Trump has and that he won his mandate on has all kinds of things to do with the turning on of our energy resources, reducing crime,
[03:23:33.770 --> 03:23:41.149]  closing the border, deporting all of these illegals here, and really focusing on making and strengthening America first.
[03:23:41.500 --> 03:23:50.159]  So this is why we are seeing globally these events unravel and unfold in some cases, whether it's a coup in Romania.
[03:23:50.159 --> 03:23:53.819]  We actually had one in the Republic of Korea.
[03:23:53.819 --> 03:23:59.559]  I'm going to be with some of my Korean friends here this evening to talk a little bit about that.
[03:24:00.250 --> 03:24:13.430]  We have this incredible rapid movement of the Islamists in Syria to topple Assad, longstanding leader of Syria.
[03:24:13.549 --> 03:24:23.049]  And I want people to be reminded that Syria was really a concoction post-World War I, principally done by the United Kingdom at the time or Great Britain at the time.
[03:24:23.309 --> 03:24:42.010]  So, all of these things that are happening, the 100,000-foot level is really, number one, is there is a clear intent to stop the Trump agenda from even beginning, and from getting on the ground and moving out in the speed that Trump wants to move out.
[03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:49.909]  And I do believe that Trump's team that he is assembling, I'm in touch with many of them, they understand what is happening, they clearly get it.
[03:24:50.250 --> 03:24:58.090]  The challenge is going to be how fast are they able to get things moving once Trump gets into office.
[03:24:58.250 --> 03:25:05.709]  And I still say, as I said before, Alex, on your show, that I still want everybody to pray for Donald Trump's safety.
[03:25:06.090 --> 03:25:19.149]  I will never take it off the table, the evil that he is facing personally, his family has been facing, and our nation has been facing it, that they would love to see the demise of President Donald J. Trump.
[03:25:19.290 --> 03:25:21.409]  And I say that very precisely.
[03:25:21.649 --> 03:25:23.950]  So that's number one is his safety.
[03:25:24.090 --> 03:25:28.469]  Number two is this new Middle East that is taking shape.
[03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:33.590]  I would say that we need to really start paying attention to what's happening inside of Iran.
[03:25:33.969 --> 03:25:53.000]  I have heard from some friends over in Europe about some potential leadership changes that might occur there, but these people have to get on the ground first, whether they operate from From the Central Asian republics or they operate from Turkey.
[03:25:53.219 --> 03:25:53.659]  Who knows?
[03:25:53.780 --> 03:26:00.559]  You know, these are the kinds of things that are going to start to take effect and the consequences of the things that we're facing.
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:09.620]  Now, I will tell you that everything that is happening in Syria is directly connected to the things happening across Eastern Europe and certainly Russia.
[03:26:09.860 --> 03:26:26.260]  And the one thing that I will remind people of is because there's not a lot of conversations about China at the On the backside of all this, Alex, and to your great audience, is the CCP. China is the big influencer here.
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:28.120]  China is the big threat here.
[03:26:28.620 --> 03:26:43.159]  China is the nation state that is fomenting much of this, and obviously they're able to do it from a position of You know, staying out of it, you know, from a media perspective, right?
[03:26:43.319 --> 03:26:44.520]  Nobody's talking about China.
[03:26:44.659 --> 03:26:51.280]  They're using proxies, and that was going to be my first question, is obviously if the whole world's erupting into what we can call the beginning of World War III, we hope we can dial it back.
[03:26:51.579 --> 03:26:53.940]  I was about to say, what's going to happen in Asia, General?
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:56.120]  Okay, so China...
[03:26:57.079 --> 03:27:16.319]  One of the things that China is doing, and I need everybody to understand this, while we are so distracted with what's going on in the Middle East and what's going on in Eastern Europe, China has been infiltrating into our system for decades, but China is taking a huge leap into places like the Caribbean,
[03:27:16.540 --> 03:27:22.500]  Cuba, and many of the Caribbean islands, the embassies that they're building in some of these countries.
[03:27:22.930 --> 03:27:27.469]  They have formed an alliance in South America and Central America with certain countries.
[03:27:27.809 --> 03:27:28.790]  Giant ports.
[03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:29.649]  Giant ports.
[03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:30.829]  They control most our ports.
[03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:31.069]  Yeah.
[03:27:31.489 --> 03:27:38.590]  Oh, like 80 to 90% of the ports, the largest ports in our hemisphere, the Chinese either own or they control.
[03:27:38.770 --> 03:27:41.329]  And they have an alliance with different countries down there.
[03:27:41.329 --> 03:27:43.670]  Of course, Brazil, Bolivia, and others.
[03:27:43.969 --> 03:27:58.799]  And one of the areas that I'm always concerned about, and I always highlight To your audience, there's the Panama Canal because 70% of our trade as well as our military capabilities have to use probably the most strategic waterway for the United States of America in the world, bar none.
[03:27:59.059 --> 03:28:18.389]  So I don't want us to be overly distracted by what's going on, and that's exactly what the Biden, Harris, Obama, What Cabal is attempting to do is to drive us toward a war that has consequences that we cannot imagine just yet.
[03:28:19.049 --> 03:28:25.290]  And never mind the exchange of nuclear-capable weapons systems between Ukraine and Russia.
[03:28:25.530 --> 03:28:27.250]  Never mind the fall of Assad.
[03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:33.250]  I want people to understand that we have elements of Iran involved and still of all this.
[03:28:34.420 --> 03:28:39.120]  Another country that hasn't gotten a lot of play is North Korea.
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:40.379]  North Korea.
[03:28:40.659 --> 03:28:47.100]  And there are things that are happening that were happening in Syria that the North Koreans were involved in.
[03:28:47.200 --> 03:28:49.840]  So there's so much at stake right now.
[03:28:50.059 --> 03:28:57.780]  And when we talk about it, we're in World War III. I don't want anybody to think that there's this regional conflict in Europe.
[03:28:58.219 --> 03:29:03.020]  That can be handled locally or this regional conflict in the Middle East that can be handled by Israel.
[03:29:03.680 --> 03:29:12.360]  CENTCOM, Central Command out of Tampa, just conducted, I think it was 200 strikes, if I got my numbers right, in the last 48 hours inside of Syria.
[03:29:12.620 --> 03:29:20.059]  So anybody that thinks we're not at war, and we're talking some of our largest, most capable Air Force platforms.
[03:29:20.059 --> 03:29:21.659]  We're talking B-52s.
[03:29:22.629 --> 03:29:29.250]  Big, big, big-time capabilities inside of Syria and the types of targets that they were going after.
[03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:36.770]  And so there was an interesting article that I read early this morning, and I think that it's right.
[03:29:36.850 --> 03:29:44.209]  And essentially, the question was asked, who's winning the war in Syria, the Pentagon or the CIA? Because they're fighting each other.
[03:29:44.329 --> 03:29:45.649]  It appears they're fighting each other.
[03:29:45.729 --> 03:29:53.090]  It's like The CIA is backing, you know, one group and the Pentagon's in there fighting on behalf of, you know, of who?
[03:29:53.250 --> 03:29:54.350]  The American people?
[03:29:54.489 --> 03:29:55.270]  The American government?
[03:29:55.450 --> 03:29:57.450]  I mean, a declared war, declared what?
[03:29:57.670 --> 03:30:00.629]  I mean, we're not even certain who's in charge in the White House.
[03:30:00.829 --> 03:30:17.069]  And this is where, to take it all back to To the sort of the strategic view of what's happening, this is where, and I'm sitting at my sort of mobile command post here in Palm Beach right now, this is where I think Donald Trump is going to have to assemble his national security team,
[03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:20.590]  kind of a wartime cabinet right now.
[03:30:21.350 --> 03:30:23.549]  And make some decisions about who to call.
[03:30:23.729 --> 03:30:42.129]  And I know that he's in his trip over to Europe and some of the statements that you just, you know, said that he had made about NATO and, you know, that he has said, I think everybody needs to be paying very close attention to the kinds of actions that Trump is going to have to take, even before he takes over as president of the United States on the 20th of January.
[03:30:42.610 --> 03:30:47.049]  We are potentially walking into a trap, right?
[03:30:47.149 --> 03:30:48.649]  And I think that Trump understands that.
[03:30:48.709 --> 03:30:49.469]  I understand it.
[03:30:49.489 --> 03:30:51.709]  And I know others on his team understand it.
[03:30:52.110 --> 03:31:06.190]  And this trap is one where we stay into this cycle of war that only benefits the military industrial complex and benefits the intelligence community security state complex.
[03:31:06.350 --> 03:31:23.770]  And it takes the eye off of the ball of what Trump really wants to do from day one, which is start reformation of our government, start holding people accountable, start taking care of America first, Items on the table, meaning the deportation campaign,
[03:31:23.930 --> 03:31:38.229]  the protection of children, rebuilding the wall that he started during his first term, and really get the energy community in our country going again, reduce crime, all of those things.
[03:31:38.809 --> 03:31:59.309]  None of which can happen on the 20th, all of which could happen in the first few months if we did not have these massive, massive distractions of these wars that we are involved in, these major regional conflicts which Everything that happens in the Middle East is directly tied to these coup operations that are going on in Eastern Europe,
[03:31:59.409 --> 03:32:04.190]  Romania, you mentioned, and what's happening in Ukraine and Russia.
[03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:13.549]  And I want people to understand that do not take our eyes off of the Chinese ball, so to speak.
[03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:18.489]  The CCP is the big gorilla in the world.
[03:32:18.489 --> 03:32:20.569]  And that was my next question in your limited time, sir.
[03:32:21.200 --> 03:32:29.340]  I know wargaming this, you don't know, the globalists are obviously trying to stir up any crisis they can anywhere, so they're not even sure what they can get going, but they're obviously trying everywhere.
[03:32:29.899 --> 03:32:33.979]  What would you expect to see in the Middle East next, Europe next, and then Asia next?
[03:32:34.159 --> 03:32:35.120]  I mean, what type of scenarios?
[03:32:35.260 --> 03:32:37.659]  You're not predicting it, but what are some of the hotspots?
[03:32:37.780 --> 03:32:44.840]  Because I remember, I don't remember what time you were on, but it was the last few months you said, I'm looking at Romania, it's a NATO member, they could be used as the trigger.
[03:32:45.079 --> 03:32:47.760]  Now we've seen a coup there over the new election, just unprecedented.
[03:32:48.059 --> 03:32:49.219]  I mean, what else are you looking at?
[03:32:50.440 --> 03:32:51.459]  Yeah, a couple of things.
[03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:56.420]  Number one, the internal turmoil in Syria still has to play out.
[03:32:56.500 --> 03:33:04.219]  There's going to be some leadership challenges there or challenges to whoever is going to become the leader of this new Syria, whether or not Syria stays together.
[03:33:04.319 --> 03:33:04.819]  That's number one.
[03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:06.110]  Turkey.
[03:33:06.290 --> 03:33:08.389]  I think everybody needs to pay very close attention.
[03:33:08.549 --> 03:33:09.610]  Turkey is a NATO ally.
[03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:12.889]  Turkey has a lot of authority and power.
[03:33:13.409 --> 03:33:17.450]  Probably the second largest military in NATO next to us.
[03:33:17.469 --> 03:33:18.610]  A very strong country.
[03:33:18.809 --> 03:33:22.110]  So I think Turkey is going to have to play a major role.
[03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:24.790]  NATO's taking advantage of us because we would...
[03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:25.790]  Look, two things.
[03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:29.590]  Number one, they take advantage of us on trade, meaning the European nations.
[03:33:29.729 --> 03:33:30.389]  Okay, like terrible.
[03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:31.409]  They don't take our cars.
[03:33:31.530 --> 03:33:33.110]  They don't take our food products.
[03:33:33.250 --> 03:33:34.049]  They don't take anything.
[03:33:34.329 --> 03:33:34.709]  They take...
[03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.969]  I am.
[03:33:39.129 --> 03:33:40.290]  So it's a double whammy.
[03:33:40.430 --> 03:33:46.430]  So let me just tell you, I was able to get hundreds of billions of dollars put into NATO just by a tough attitude.
[03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:49.829]  I said to the countries, I'm not gonna protect you unless you pay.
[03:33:49.909 --> 03:33:50.709]  And they started paying.
[03:33:51.010 --> 03:33:53.549]  And that amounted to more than $600 billion.
[03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:54.690]  That's a big thing.
[03:33:54.729 --> 03:33:55.950]  Otherwise, they wouldn't even be fighting.
[03:33:56.110 --> 03:33:57.370]  They wouldn't have any money to fight.
[03:33:58.690 --> 03:34:03.950]  If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely.
[03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:09.850]  From the United States after you're sworn into office.
[03:34:10.170 --> 03:34:10.450]  Probably.
[03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.870]  Sure.
[03:34:12.610 --> 03:34:13.870]  All right, we have General Flynn back.
[03:34:14.010 --> 03:34:15.770]  He has a very limited time, a very, very busy man.
[03:34:16.989 --> 03:34:22.569]  Finish up with your point about the Middle East, then based a little bit on Europe, then a little bit on China.
[03:34:22.729 --> 03:34:27.690]  And then in closing, if you can tell us, I mean, Tom Homan has said, no, we're going after to find the children.
[03:34:27.829 --> 03:34:30.870]  We're going to prosecute the NGOs and the administration officials.
[03:34:31.549 --> 03:34:32.709]  Trump has now backed that.
[03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:33.969]  I mean, this is seismic.
[03:34:34.409 --> 03:34:36.250]  Trump's telling the globalists on guard.
[03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:39.530]  So if you can just hit quickly those four quick points, sir.
[03:34:40.370 --> 03:34:46.790]  Yeah, so number one, what I was saying was that I think Iran, we're going to see some unrest in Iran here, and that's clear.
[03:34:46.989 --> 03:34:55.870]  I do think that one of the things that Trump needs to also make a statement about is he needs to tell this current administration to back off fomenting unrest in Eastern Europe.
[03:34:56.069 --> 03:34:57.090]  That has to happen.
[03:34:57.270 --> 03:34:59.629]  That's clear to me that that's going on.
[03:34:59.889 --> 03:35:03.809]  And it's probably elements inside of the U.S. intelligence community that are doing that.
[03:35:03.909 --> 03:35:06.969]  I'm glad to see Trump talk about NATO the way he's talking about them.
[03:35:07.069 --> 03:35:08.290]  Basically, they've got to foot the bill.
[03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:09.870]  They've got to get involved.
[03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:20.790]  And also, I think the next big conversation that we're going to start to hear about is the U.N., because the United Nations also needs to be made to heal here a little bit because of the things that they're fomenting as well.
[03:35:21.030 --> 03:35:33.069]  Back to the domestic agenda and what I know Tom Holman is really focused on, and so is in the president, is this America First agenda and this largest deportation campaign.
[03:35:33.489 --> 03:35:40.629]  One of the big cartels, and I want people to understand this big cartel here in this country, is the Cartel del Sol, which is out of Venezuela.
[03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:47.950]  They're probably the lead cartel, never mind the Mexican cartels, who work directly for the Chinese government.
[03:35:48.290 --> 03:35:51.829]  So, we have to take on this priority.
[03:35:52.010 --> 03:35:53.889]  We've got to juggle this crystal ball.
[03:35:53.989 --> 03:35:55.489]  We cannot let this one drop.
[03:35:56.270 --> 03:36:00.309]  And that is in addition to all of these things that are going on overseas.
[03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:06.309]  And if there's one guy that I know, just listening to him over the last couple of weeks, that has a good grasp on all this, it's Trump.
[03:36:06.770 --> 03:36:09.190]  Now, he cannot do this alone.
[03:36:09.430 --> 03:36:14.430]  His national security team, every single American, all of us, all of us have to weigh in together.
[03:36:14.610 --> 03:36:33.309]  And I do believe if we do this and we show strength as an American citizenry, then Donald Trump can do whatever actions and take whatever actions he needs to take in order to transform the kinds of things that we are going to need to go through here in order to make America great again.
[03:36:33.559 --> 03:36:57.840]  And I will tell you that I do believe that Russia and the likes of Putin, Putin has been very calm because with some of the direct threats that he has been presented with, I do believe, and we cannot keep pressing him because at some point in time as a sovereign nation state leader with the largest The biggest component of nuclear weapons in the world,
[03:36:57.959 --> 03:37:03.280]  on the planet, he has got to protect his own citizens and the safety and security of his own country.
[03:37:03.459 --> 03:37:10.780]  So you go after the tiger's tail too much, you're eventually going to feel the bite.
[03:37:10.879 --> 03:37:12.459]  And that's what I don't want to have happen.
[03:37:12.459 --> 03:37:13.379]  I don't want to see happen.
[03:37:13.399 --> 03:37:19.379]  And I'm hopeful that That Trump and Putin have had some exchange of information.
[03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:28.639]  I'm paying attention to what Lavrov, his Minister of Interior, or is essentially his State Department lead that Lavrov has said recently.
[03:37:28.959 --> 03:37:40.959]  So all of these things matter, Alex, and these are the kinds of consequences that happen when we have a pathetic leadership in the, I call it the O'Biden leadership.
[03:37:45.450 --> 03:37:46.690]  It's not Biden.
[03:37:46.889 --> 03:37:47.530]  It's not Biden.
[03:37:47.809 --> 03:37:54.569]  I think Obama, we've seen him pop out in the last couple of days, you know, with more comments about what lines need to be crossed.
[03:37:54.829 --> 03:37:56.930]  I mean, this is outrageous, outrageous.
[03:37:57.149 --> 03:37:58.450]  This is not a peaceful transition.
[03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:00.909]  From one administration to the next.
[03:38:01.069 --> 03:38:08.889]  This is an administration that's currently in play, who has basically gotten everything wrong.
[03:38:09.149 --> 03:38:17.690]  And maybe at the end of the day, maybe this is exactly what they want to achieve, you know, since their loss of the election.
[03:38:18.220 --> 03:38:34.200]  Maybe what they want to do is they want to destroy any opportunity that Trump has to be able to have an effective transition and to be able to have an early effective administration with the agenda of an America First agenda, which is not what the military industrial complex wants.
[03:38:34.239 --> 03:38:37.479]  It's not what the war complex wants.
[03:38:37.579 --> 03:38:42.229]  It's not what the security state We're good to go.
[03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:55.049]  We're good to go.
[03:38:55.819 --> 03:38:56.979]  It's all connected.
[03:38:56.979 --> 03:38:58.540]  It is absolutely all connected.
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:18.360]  And the big 100,000-foot level is that the outgoing administration wants to turn over to this administration a war so they cannot execute the America First agenda that Trump won in such a huge mandate on during this last presidential election.
[03:39:18.479 --> 03:39:20.979]  So thanks for allowing me to have a little bit of time with your great audience, Alex.
[03:39:21.379 --> 03:39:24.280]  And let's just keep paying attention to what's happening.
[03:39:25.239 --> 03:39:26.280]  GeneralFlynn.com.
[03:39:26.319 --> 03:39:27.420]  People can see your amazing film.
[03:39:27.559 --> 03:39:28.819]  It's so important there and more.
[03:39:28.979 --> 03:39:30.260]  General, thank you for the time, sir.
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:31.340]  God bless.
[03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:41.719]  The entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[03:39:44.059 --> 03:39:45.559]  You know you're in a war, right?
[03:39:46.299 --> 03:39:47.600]  And it's a declared war.
[03:39:47.700 --> 03:39:49.579]  The globalists have declared war on team humanity.
[03:39:49.579 --> 03:39:52.000]  They've declared war on the God that made us.
[03:39:52.840 --> 03:39:54.440]  It is not incredible.
[03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:55.639]  It is not heroic.
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:39:58.079]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:39:59.559]  It is survival.
[03:40:00.700 --> 03:40:02.860]  This is the priority.
[03:40:03.399 --> 03:40:04.819]  This is the real world.
[03:40:04.899 --> 03:40:05.700]  This is game time.
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:08.180]  This is the crossroads of human destiny right now.
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:08.979]  Right now.
[03:40:09.420 --> 03:40:14.579]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is.
[03:40:14.959 --> 03:40:16.819]  We need maximum urgency.
[03:40:17.239 --> 03:40:20.139]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen.
[03:40:20.280 --> 03:40:21.479]  Don't you understand that?
[03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:24.389]  I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:26.389]  I want you to kill with truth.
[03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:27.930]  Kill with your will.
[03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.629]  Kill!
[03:40:28.909 --> 03:40:29.309]  Kill!
[03:40:29.549 --> 03:40:30.649]  Kill their lies!
[03:40:50.840 --> 03:40:52.280]  This is a vital transmission.
[03:40:52.579 --> 03:40:54.379]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[03:40:54.860 --> 03:40:58.360]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[03:40:58.659 --> 03:41:01.219]  So, we need to stay on air.
[03:41:01.379 --> 03:41:02.840]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[03:41:02.979 --> 03:41:06.840]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:11.860]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:41:12.579 --> 03:41:15.819]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[03:41:15.940 --> 03:41:17.420]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[03:41:19.020 --> 03:41:25.299]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:27.200]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:30.659]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[03:41:31.639 --> 03:41:33.540]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:35.700]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[03:41:37.059 --> 03:41:37.620]  Unfortunately...
[03:41:38.780 --> 03:41:42.600]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[03:41:43.079 --> 03:41:48.700]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[03:41:48.799 --> 03:41:49.540]  That continues.
[03:41:49.719 --> 03:41:50.540]  Look at this bad boy.
[03:41:50.659 --> 03:41:53.379]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[03:41:53.559 --> 03:41:54.200]  I designed it.
[03:41:54.319 --> 03:41:59.120]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:41:59.159 --> 03:42:00.620]  And they are a fundraiser.
[03:42:00.719 --> 03:42:02.100]  They are a piece of history.
[03:42:02.299 --> 03:42:04.100]  They're pure silver.
[03:42:04.520 --> 03:42:07.040]  They are minted here in America.
[03:42:08.159 --> 03:42:09.360]  2,000 of these.
[03:42:09.659 --> 03:42:11.819]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[03:42:12.180 --> 03:42:16.219]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[03:42:16.479 --> 03:42:17.459]  They are incredible.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:24.239]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:24.340 --> 03:42:32.350]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:35.670]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[03:42:35.809 --> 03:42:38.629]  So get this amazing coin now.
[03:42:38.829 --> 03:42:47.090]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, we have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them.
[03:42:47.379 --> 03:42:52.659]  Between 995 and 1495, when tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[03:42:52.879 --> 03:42:55.260]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[03:42:55.879 --> 03:42:58.360]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:43:01.399]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[03:43:01.780 --> 03:43:03.959]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[03:43:04.079 --> 03:43:05.799]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[03:43:05.989 --> 03:43:09.010]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:11.309]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[03:43:11.530 --> 03:43:12.569]  They surprised me with this.
[03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:13.649]  I just learned this morning.
[03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:18.030]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:20.350]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:43:20.530 --> 03:43:25.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:28.590]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[03:43:28.709 --> 03:43:30.610]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:32.350]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[03:43:33.100 --> 03:43:35.440]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[03:43:35.879 --> 03:43:39.239]  We've probably got 15 of those elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[03:43:39.459 --> 03:43:40.040]  We have a lot of fun.
[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:44.000]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[03:43:44.319 --> 03:43:46.059]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[03:43:46.180 --> 03:43:46.879]  And I already called them.
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:49.020]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[03:43:49.120 --> 03:43:49.920]  So that means there's...
[03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:53.430]  1,900 and something of these.
[03:43:53.569 --> 03:43:56.110]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[03:43:56.489 --> 03:43:58.530]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:59.790]  All my problems would be solved.
[03:43:59.950 --> 03:44:01.010]  We would have plenty of fun.
