[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.679]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.520]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.259]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.509]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.329]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.710]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.790]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:07.510]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.629]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:11.310]  Listen.
[00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:17.230]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.500]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:45.700]  44 days, 23 hours, 58 minutes, 5 seconds to the inauguration of President Donald John Trump.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:02:03.170]  It is Friday, December 6, 2024. And the entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:17.969]  I am your embattled, battle-hardened host, coming to you from the battle-scarred studios of Infowars in Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.189]  Massive news and information today.
[00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.949]  We'll be taking your calls.
[00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.110]  Putin issues a final.
[00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.889]  They're saying, I can't keep issuing these warnings of imminent World War III and nuclear war.
[00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.530]  Then, of course, we have Trump cutting off the Ukrainian war funding.
[00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.750]  And that's gotten almost no attention in the news.
[00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.389]  But we've covered it here.
[00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:04.330]  Trump also met with the big poison shot makers last night with RFK Jr. at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.870]  We're going to get into big developments on that front and a lot more.
[00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:24.490]  We're also learning a lot more about Biden is, as I predicted, not just going to do preemptive pardons for the people they listed a few days ago, but everybody is Because they ordered their minions to commit these crimes,
[00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.090]  they want to protect them as well.
[00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:36.770]  Also, Canada, as we predicted they would do a few years ago when they had national gun registration, promised they weren't going to take your guns.
[00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.270]  Then, two years ago, they banned all sales of semi-autos.
[00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.250]  And now, they have announced national gun confiscation, and there's not even a law.
[00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.250]  Remember, Trudeau said he admires communist China.
[00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.729]  They said, what do you admire most in the world?
[00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.770]  To cross your enemies, to see them living before you, and the lamentation of the women.
[00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.590]  No, he...
[00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.800]  Ed Meyer's basic dictatorship the most.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.539]  And that's what they're establishing, a WEF, New World Order dictatorship.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.519]  Every attack you see there is a microcosm of what they want to do here.
[00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:22.930]  So even if you don't care about the Canadian people, and I care about everybody, I have empathy, you should care because this is serious.
[00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.750]  We've got that as well.
[00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.670]  Oh my gosh, so much news today.
[00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:33.889]  And as I predicted, the Connecticut Appellate Court in the Sandy Hook show trials ruled against me about 20 minutes ago.
[00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.790]  Stay with us.
[00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:44.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, transmitting worldwide in defense of liberty and resistance to tyranny in all its forms.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:58.980]  To quote Thomas Jefferson, I have sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.600]  Live in the dream.
[00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:15.449]  Exactly where I want to be, at the helm of one of the most powerful, successful engines of truth and war against corruption and tyranny.
[00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:25.649]  Yes, our ship is on fire, but it lights the way through the darkness as we destroy the enemy.
[00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.029]  This is beyond epic.
[00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.110]  And I tell my enemies, you have only awoken the giant within me.
[00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.170]  You have only taken the infowar to the next level.
[00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.990]  And I pledge to you, you will be defeated.
[00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:47.850]  Surrender.
[00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.670]  In our moment of triumph, I have only begun to fight.
[00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:06.149]  It is Friday, December 6th, 2024. And how many days are we until President Trump is inaugurated?
[00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:16.769]  Despite all the lawfare, all the fake charges, all the election scams, all the fraud, the 47th President of the United States of America.
[00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.230]  44 days, 23 hours, 51 minutes, 58 minutes.
[00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.250]  Now it's 40 seconds.
[00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.009]  Oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.110]  Alright, let me just do this.
[00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.230]  Let me tell you what we got here for you today.
[00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.769]  Russia warns that World War III may be coming.
[00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.089]  We have the full Lavrov-Tucker interview.
[00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:43.870]  U.S. and Russia need to cooperate for the sake of the universe.
[00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:44.810]  Yeah.
[00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:50.250]  Powerful breakdown from the EU Parliament on just exactly what we're facing with total war.
[00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.970]  A lot more on that front.
[00:06:54.089 --> 00:07:01.089]  The really big news, because it affects us all, because this is a WEF, in their own words, we penetrate the cabinets.
[00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.069]  Well, what's your best example of the WEF take over the world?
[00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:14.110]  David Gergen asked Klaus Schwab a few years ago at the Kennedy Center, and he said, why, Justin Trudeau?
[00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:23.420]  Now, Canadian Public Safety Minister, Dominique LeBlanc, Said they are prohibiting firearms in Canada, period.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.800]  Total gun confiscation effective immediately.
[00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.120]  And they're going to donate them to Ukraine.
[00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:31.300]  Ah, yes, the dictatorship.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.759]  Maybe Trump should annex Canada.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.240]  We really should liberate them.
[00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:43.860]  Today, the government is adding a further 324 unique makers and models of assault-style weapons in the list of prohibited firearms in Canada.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.220]  Their prohibition takes effect immediately.
[00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.800]  Ah, Trudeau's basic dictatorship.
[00:07:49.629 --> 00:08:00.269]  As part of this process, he says, the government of Canada has committed to the Ukrainian government to identify whether some of these guns could be donated to support the fight for democracy.
[00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:08.329]  Yes, they've suspended the election, has arrested all their political opposition, taken over all the media, and said that Zelensky's a dictator.
[00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:11.430]  But that's what you get from Trudeau.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.139]  Meanwhile, David Hoggy says he wants to take over the Democratic Party and be the DNC chair.
[00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.220]  Delusions of grandeur.
[00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:25.459]  We'll be getting to all of that.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.939]  Elon Musk and Vivek Ramoswani start brainstorming with their visit to Congress, the House and Senate.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.940]  A lot of big events there.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.019]  We're also going to get into the big news.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.279]  Trump and RFK Jr. die with Pfizer and Eli Lilly, execs at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.779]  Wait till you hear what was discussed.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.559]  More mystery UFO drones swarming around the cities.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.559]  But don't worry, the FBI is investigating.
[00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:09.230]  We're also going to continue getting into a lot of economic news and what's happening with President Trump and the Consumer Confidence Index surging.
[00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:17.389]  But will it be too little too late as the private federal reserve index policies to pull the rug out from under the incoming president?
[00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:22.100]  We've got big developments on different appointments.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:22.580]  Breaking.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.000]  National Police Association endorses Kash Patel for FBI director.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:37.059]  MSNBC's Joy Reid compares opposition to gender-affirming care, sterilizing children and chopping their genitals off to Nazism.
[00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:37.779]  Yes!
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.879]  Also, jurors deadlocked in the Daniel...
[00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:48.519]  Penny manslaughter trial over subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely.
[00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:55.639]  And we've got different senators endorsing saying we must have transgenders in the military to win.
[00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:09.100]  Lawyers slammed DOJ's insane online gag order against Texas doctor who exposed criminal, illegal, secret sterilizations of children in Texas without parental consent.
[00:10:10.669 --> 00:10:21.929]  And a lot more, obviously, today, more on Biden's preemptive pardons, which are literally get-out-of-jail-free cards.
[00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:24.049]  Now he says he's making up to everybody in the federal government.
[00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.029]  Absolutely insane.
[00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:41.190]  Also, Mohammed is England's most popular boy's baby name for the first time as the Islamic conquering Of Europe accelerates.
[00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:53.269]  You've also got everybody from Bill Maher to Jeff Bezos to Mark Zuckerberg to Senator Fetterman bowing the knee to Trump, saying, and Musk, you know, they're trying to save us.
[00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.669]  They're good.
[00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:54.490]  Let's work with them.
[00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:02.730]  Are they capitulating to common sense, or is it a deception?
[00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.950]  It's both.
[00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:06.250]  It's important to understand this.
[00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:09.009]  I'll be getting to that coming up.
[00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.450]  And so much more today.
[00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.730]  Wait till you hear what Obama just came out and said.
[00:11:14.789 --> 00:11:15.330]  We have the video.
[00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.970]  This is next-level gaslighting.
[00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:29.669]  Big transmission for the next three hours and 46 minutes that we have left in transmission ahead of the great Owen Schroyer today.
[00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:30.409]  3 p.m.
[00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.289]  Central with The War Room.
[00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:38.570]  And today's show, Saturday's show, Sunday's show, and Monday's shows could easily...
[00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:46.120]  Be the last time we broadcast out of these studios and the Infowars website can be seized again.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.159]  You're like, gosh, this just keeps going on and on.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.700]  Well, this is what a struggle looks like.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.240]  This is what a fight looks like.
[00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:01.740]  You know, the best basketball or football games are close right to the end, but those don't matter.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.980]  This is a real fight.
[00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:07.429]  The Democratic Party, and I said it wrong the other day.
[00:12:07.929 --> 00:12:08.950]  Type this into Google.
[00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.549]  I don't even believe it, but it's true.
[00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.809]  The Democrats said, not this money, but last Monday when the judge slapped him down and said the sale of the onion didn't happen to Bloomberg's group.
[00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:21.190]  Really, every town that owns it and runs it.
[00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.549]  He said, it did not happen.
[00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:23.049]  It's not true.
[00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:24.470]  Stop saying it, though they still say it.
[00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.250]  And he said, you all have to answer questions.
[00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:28.190]  You've all got to be deposed.
[00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:29.129]  I order you to be deposed.
[00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.529]  I order the owner of the onion to be deposed.
[00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:32.210]  I order...
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.559]  You to be here at the hearing this Monday.
[00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:39.440]  And they're refusing to be deposed.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.440]  They're saying the judge didn't say that.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.440]  When my lawyers give the transcripts, they say, nope.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.159]  One of them, though, the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department, he did.
[00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:51.259]  He got deposed yesterday.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.019]  Ooh, my lawyers want me to wait.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.620]  Maybe till this afternoon, maximum tomorrow, because they've got their transcript.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.559]  They want the official one.
[00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:04.490]  Boy, this is something.
[00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:11.090]  If you think you've seen some craziness out of this case, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:26.330]  So, this is so bad that I've actually been pinching myself that this might be some incredible dream.
[00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:36.059]  Oh, you think giving one rule to any other bidder, saying no credit or no formulas, and then they used formulas, and then gave the lesser bid the win, you think that's bad?
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.220]  You think changing the rules two days before is bad, and not giving the new rules until after the fake auction to the other bidder is bad?
[00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:46.879]  You think judges finding me guilty that having show trials produced by HBO is bad?
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.879]  Guilty until proven how guilty?
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.879]  No.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.299]  You think after the fake auction, giving...
[00:13:55.399 --> 00:14:01.779]  My lawyers and the real auction winner lawyers, the minutes of how they rigged it?
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.740]  You think that's big?
[00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:19.399]  All of it pales in significance to the latest thing that the federal trustee from the Justice Department that did all this told my lawyers in Houston yesterday, eyeball to eyeball, on video camera.
[00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.009]  I am godsmacked.
[00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:35.090]  I'm not going to tell you yet because they're getting the actual transcript.
[00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:48.850]  Because you have to have an outside group do a transcript that's the court certified before they want to just follow every little niblet of the regulations of law.
[00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:52.889]  Every T crossed, every I perfectly dotted.
[00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:56.450]  You need to take your time with something like this.
[00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.429]  These things must be done delicately.
[00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:12.159]  So That ties into this that we're going to hit first, because it affects everybody in free speech, and it's a window into the total weaponization and lawfare of the legal system against the American people.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:25.440]  I shot a report at about 9.20 this morning, and then I uploaded it at about 9.30.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.659]  You can see the timestamp on X. Let's pull up the X for Alex Jones tweets.
[00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.419]  We're going to get the exact timestamp I'm going from memory.
[00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:59.649]  And I predicted that the Connecticut appellate court that had said at 10.30 Central, 11.30 Eastern, they would release their ruling on the $1.5 billion kangaroo show trial judgment from two years ago at this very time in Connecticut.
[00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:02.909]  Where I was already found guilty by the judge.
[00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.830]  The judge said I couldn't say I was innocent.
[00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.269]  The judge then instructed the jury he is guilty.
[00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:09.490]  He will decide how guilty he is.
[00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.769]  He is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:12.909]  He got it all from these people.
[00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.690]  None of that was true.
[00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.169]  He sent people to pee on graves, attack people.
[00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:17.570]  They would then ask him, well, who came to attack you?
[00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.149]  I don't know.
[00:16:18.409 --> 00:16:18.850]  Did you tell anybody?
[00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.250]  No.
[00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.470]  Who peed on your grave?
[00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:20.970]  I don't know.
[00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:22.509]  Somebody told me.
[00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.009]  Who told you?
[00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.470]  I don't know.
[00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:28.779]  FBI agent got $130 million, made up money, who started all the lawsuits.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.960]  And they asked him, my lawyer, Norm Pattinson, is coming on in 15 minutes.
[00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:37.440]  He said, it's all on video on national TV. He said, so did Mr. Jones ever say your name?
[00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:37.720]  No.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.039]  His employees ever say your name?
[00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:39.279]  No.
[00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:40.440]  They ever put an article about you?
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:40.559]  No.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.299]  They ever show your face?
[00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:41.580]  No.
[00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:43.759]  Well, why are you here?
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.820]  Why did you go get him sued?
[00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:46.940]  He was the head lawyer of the FBI Connecticut.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.299]  Aldenburg, they said, why did you...
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.559]  Sue him.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.120]  He said, what happened?
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.679]  He said, well, a man called me.
[00:16:56.379 --> 00:16:56.899]  Well, who?
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.980]  Well, his name's XYZ as an online news site.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:09.759]  And he called me once and he called me on my phone in the afternoon one day and said, oh, I'm just seeing if you're a real FBI agent.
[00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.740]  And my lawyer said, and that's what happened?
[00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:13.339]  He said, yeah.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.259]  Was he rude to you?
[00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:15.759]  Did he yell at you?
[00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.059]  No.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.019]  I mean, we've got the video.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.579]  We played it before.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.039]  It was on...
[00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:21.980]  I mean, he literally...
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.140]  Okay.
[00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.700]  $130 million.
[00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.539]  Now, the Connecticut law says you've got to say somebody's name for defamation.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.200]  Didn't even say...
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.180]  Never even know who he was.
[00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.900]  Never did any of the stuff they said I did.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.240]  Ran PR for years, raising hundreds of millions for Bloomberg's gun control group.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.380]  Saying I was harassing them.
[00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.619]  And look, he's being mean to us.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.660]  He's coming to get us, give us money, money.
[00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.759]  And then said I was making money off them.
[00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:54.519]  Hadn't talked about them for three plus years before they even sued me.
[00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:56.720]  We went through all the discovery.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.599]  They entered 22 minutes of me talking about Sandy Hook as their evidence.
[00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:03.420]  One time a caller calls in and says, yeah, I think it's fake.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.700]  And they go, yeah, I think it's synthetic too.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.119]  I can say the moon's made of cheese if I wanted to.
[00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:11.529]  I said, small, it looked fake the day it broke.
[00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.029]  People were like, oh, watch out, you're going to get sued.
[00:18:13.069 --> 00:18:13.670]  It was fake.
[00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.410]  But it doesn't matter, folks.
[00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:17.490]  We have a First Amendment.
[00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:20.869]  And I was super famous.
[00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.170]  I was the biggest talk show host, English speaking in the world, bigger than even Rogan is today.
[00:18:27.869 --> 00:18:29.049]  We're back to those numbers.
[00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:32.029]  I mean, arguably, other than Elon Musk, we are now the biggest show.
[00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.730]  I mean, we're talking 100 billion a day now.
[00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.190]  On the big days.
[00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.450]  Most days, about 60, 70 million.
[00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:41.329]  And it's not about who's number one, but the enemy recognized that and came after me.
[00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:52.430]  And for two years, they ran stories that I was attacking people and doing things, and people would call me, like I had Ron Paul on as a guest during the break, and he goes, Alex, I'm coming on today, but I don't hear about Sandy Hook.
[00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:55.490]  And I said, Congressman or Doctor, I don't talk about that.
[00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:57.329]  He goes, well, why is it all over the news?
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.759]  And I said, they're just hyping it up for attention to demonize Trump by demonizing me.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.180]  He goes, well, I don't know if that's true, Alex.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.000]  And I said, doctor, you've been on my show for decades, and I've really been a friend of yours.
[00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:11.119]  But I said, that's not true.
[00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:15.500]  And he goes, listen, I'm not going to do this interview if you're going to bring it up.
[00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.039]  And I said, no, no, I'm not going to bring it up.
[00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:21.000]  I just want you to believe me as a friend.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.519]  And he said, fine, just don't bring it up.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.779]  And I never called him back and never had him on again.
[00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:27.880]  He owes me an apology.
[00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:33.680]  I helped him get in office in 2016. He admitted to me that our listeners raised him half the money.
[00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:34.859]  I helped get his son in the Senate.
[00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:36.259]  And I'm not mad at him.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:43.140]  It's just that I got lied about, like Trump hates all Mexicans or loves the KKK. He never said that.
[00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:48.259]  They just say that and say that and say that and say that and say that and say that.
[00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:51.500]  I stuck up for Ron Paul over and over again.
[00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:53.259]  People lied about him endlessly.
[00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:54.359]  I'm not even mad at him.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.319]  It's just a microcosm example.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.359]  Because, you know, people are like, well, why?
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.799]  I mean, folks, they would write thousands of articles a week for a while.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.720]  Hundreds a day on average.
[00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.980]  Every TV news channel in the country.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.539]  I'd be in a restaurant, a bar, in a hotel, turn the TV on.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.000]  Alex Jones is attacking children.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.779]  He's coming for them.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.059]  And they were raising money with ads on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.880]  He's coming.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.500]  He's getting us.
[00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.339]  Give money to us now.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.019]  Help us!
[00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:21.839]  Help us!
[00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:22.799]  Help us!
[00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:24.829]  And I'm like, hey, I think it happened.
[00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.490]  Leave me alone.
[00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:27.230]  And they're like, oh, he admits it.
[00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:29.049]  He lied for years.
[00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:29.789]  I'm like, no, no.
[00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:31.849]  Megyn Kelly will tell me why you did question it.
[00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:34.109]  Well, I questioned it because of this and that, but I think it happened.
[00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.109]  Oh, we're suing you!
[00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:35.549]  See?
[00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.849]  Statue of limitations.
[00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.269]  Because they had to get statute of limitations.
[00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.490]  They sent her as a lawyer, this all came out, to get me to talk about it for statute of limitations.
[00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:51.819]  And they thought, if we just discredit him, we discredit the independent media and everybody else and populism, and it didn't work.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.180]  Now you've got Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and everybody else to deal with.
[00:20:55.519 --> 00:21:09.099]  All the most popular talk shows, not just here, but in England, in Europe, in Australia, in Mexico, in Canada, in Germany, in Italy, in Switzerland, everywhere, just sound just like me.
[00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:11.920]  RFK Jr., all of them.
[00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:22.680]  Because I'm looking at the exact same documents, and people now know how the globalists operate, they know how the tricks work, and I don't have to get you to listen to me or even believe what I say, I just say, here it is.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.259]  Here's the globalist BlackRock global social credit score total control takeover plan.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.599]  Here they are saying they're going to use lawfare to shut down any of their political opposition.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.480]  Here they are saying it ain't about money with Alex Jones, it's about shutting him down and setting the president to shut anybody else down.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.279]  Want to see the clips for the thousandth time?
[00:21:41.319 --> 00:21:43.880]  So I am honored that they picked me.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.579]  I am honored.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:56.180]  Oh yeah, I love how they met with her, sent her to do it, and then turned on her as well to play victims and say don't air the interview.
[00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:58.240]  It's just, it's sick.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.759]  It's ghoulish.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.680]  70-something million from Remington.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.559]  The mother buys the gun legally herself or crazy son Adam Lenz that killed the kids, not me.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.740]  Kills some people.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.220]  It's tragic.
[00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.220]  The internet doesn't believe it.
[00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:14.359]  There's some anomalies.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.200]  People ask questions.
[00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:21.220]  These professors and people come out and with their stories that it didn't happen, we interview a few of them here and there and say, we're not sure.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.220]  Alex Jones becomes the number one talk show host.
[00:22:25.259 --> 00:22:25.799]  Demonize him.
[00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:26.759]  Raise money off of him.
[00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:27.359]  Run around.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.039]  Play victim constantly.
[00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:31.880]  Attach yourself to Alex Jones and attach me to Trump.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.380]  Call for Trump to denounce Alex Jones and these terrible things he did that I didn't do.
[00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.640]  Then sue me.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.779]  Then get all the Discovery, they don't find anything wrong.
[00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:47.440]  Somebody plants child porn on us.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.880]  The FBI says they never opened it.
[00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:49.799]  Jones is a victim.
[00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:51.440]  They still run headlines.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.420]  Jones has child porn, sends it to Sandy Hook families.
[00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:58.599]  They want all these emails with key search terms.
[00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:03.220]  Right after I get sued, I get sent an email with hidden links you can't even see in the metadata.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.680]  They ask for all these keywords, get hundreds of thousands of emails, scan them, and then find that.
[00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:14.890]  And say, Alex Jones sent us child porn.
[00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:19.210]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.910]  That dirty bastard.
[00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:28.150]  Not, hey, we sued him and scanned all his emails and found hidden links of somebody saying, F you, I hope you die for talking about Sandy Hook.
[00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:30.809]  And then in the link is the child porn.
[00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:32.289]  Wonder who did that.
[00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:41.410]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:45.799]  And this morning, I posted it at 9.38.
[00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:50.380]  The Supreme Court did it a little bit late.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.700]  They said they do it at 11.30 Eastern.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.500]  They did it at about 11.40 Eastern.
[00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:54.619]  I have the time stamp right here.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.400]  Yeah, 11.41.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.680]  So, over an hour after I post it, they come out and say, yep, it stands.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:10.920]  I mean, they took $150 million off because they said unfair trade practices.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:17.039]  That I made money off Sandy Hook and sold vitamins off of Sandy Hook.
[00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:18.420]  What the hell does that have?
[00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:21.920]  What the hell does Sandy Hook have to do with vitamins?
[00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:27.619]  No, I sell vitamins by saying, these are really high quality, they're top rated, this is what it says it does for you.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.819]  Try it out for yourself.
[00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:33.779]  We go out and get private labeled, that's mainly what we do, the very top brands.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.779]  So, I mean, go to Whole Foods, go anywhere, it's everywhere.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.299]  Go to GNC, everybody knows this stuff's great.
[00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:45.680]  Even raw turmeric is amazing for inflammation in your immune system.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.839]  You get the concentrated stuff.
[00:24:46.859 --> 00:24:47.259]  It's incredible.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.099]  Everybody knows that.
[00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:52.500]  Go to the most elite medical clinics with medical doctors and you go into them.
[00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:55.079]  I've been to some and it's just nothing but top supplements.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.799]  And I start looking at the private label and go and see who made it.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.980]  I go, God, we're selling half the stuff they're selling here.
[00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:05.920]  So they try to act like that's a scam.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:20.759]  And And they tell him I made, you know, $360 million that I had by looking at how much money had come in gross in a decade.
[00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:25.940]  And then they say he made that money off them.
[00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:35.930]  And the Texas jury said, well, we think he only deserves to pay 10% of his net wealth to them $45 million.
[00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.089]  We talked to the jurors after you can do that legally.
[00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:39.390]  My lawyers talked to most of them.
[00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.009]  They would talk to them.
[00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:42.049]  And later, we talked to them again.
[00:25:42.089 --> 00:25:42.769]  They got really upset.
[00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:46.549]  We've got that for the appeals that are going on in Texas, which we will win.
[00:25:46.829 --> 00:25:51.809]  It's totally cut and dry here, and it's not the same court system as Connecticut that's known for being tyrannical.
[00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:53.920]  Very dark place.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.920]  And the jury's like, wait a minute, you're not worth $360 million?
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.440]  No evidence.
[00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:05.039]  They just have a guy and a fake Thurston Howell III, Buffy.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.240]  He's like, oh, hello.
[00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:10.559]  Mr. Jones currently has $360 million in his bank account.
[00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:17.319]  He has made billions himself, and he's probably one of the richest men in the world.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.640]  He made it all off of them.
[00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.289]  And that day, in the show trial, the judge said no response.
[00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.910]  We couldn't even talk.
[00:26:25.369 --> 00:26:26.230]  He's up there all day.
[00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.829]  He's quite frankly the most devastating mind we've ever seen.
[00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.509]  He made it all off of these children.
[00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.750]  So I suggest billions, because they'll make billions more.
[00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:45.190]  We'll come back and actually look at the Connecticut ruling and how important it is to the First Amendment straight ahead.
[00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.029]  But these people have convicted themselves They're a joke!
[00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:50.890]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:53.890]  There is a big sale going on right now.
[00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:56.029]  Black Friday Cyber Monday.

[00:27:19.099 --> 00:27:20.240]  And then that ends.

[00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:39.640]  Automatic at checkout on top of the other specials.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.460]  That's insane.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.200]  That's why the owner of the company was here last week and he said, he said, Alex, you say we do tunica discounts.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.339]  Sometimes they're not enough profit.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.400]  He goes, we're really going to hate this.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.400]  Yeah, but their thought is you're going to love the product so much.

[00:28:02.589 --> 00:28:04.369]  So we try to make it easy for you to support.

[00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.430]  They really do work.
[00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.210]  They really are amazing.
[00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.970]  The t-shirts, hundreds and hundreds of great designs of ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies.
[00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.069]  I mean, they're just amazing.
[00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:16.109]  So proud of them.
[00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.690]  With our great sponsor, The AlexShieldStore.
[00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:18.990]  Which, again, is not owned by me.
[00:28:19.579 --> 00:28:22.299]  Even if the bad guys are able to get InfoWars, they have no claim on that.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.400]  It will continue on as our sponsor at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:26.980]  So now is the time to take action.
[00:28:27.099 --> 00:28:30.480]  The Alex Jones gear, the Patriot gear, the 1776 gear.
[00:28:30.759 --> 00:28:37.599]  I'd put it in Trump gear, Alex Jones InfoWars gear, and Patriot 1776 Founding Father type stuff.
[00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:38.740]  That's my favorite gear.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.039]  And funny, the stuff I like the best is the best selling.
[00:28:41.259 --> 00:28:43.380]  It goes Patriot gear, Alex Jones gear.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:50.950]  It's the same thing, but, you know, with the It's great Trump gear, but quite frankly, that shirt's really popular right there.
[00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.029]  Trump, better coverage than Verizon, now do you hear us.
[00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:57.670]  But no, the Trump gear is the least popular category.
[00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.230]  People like the anti-New World Order, pro-America stuff.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.519]  That's what I guess would be most popular.
[00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:03.380]  That's what's most popular.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.400]  I would think Team Humanity would be very popular.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:05.859]  It's not.
[00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.019]  That's what we are on show.
[00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:12.380]  And then as I said, also all those other specials and more.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.900]  So 25% off on top of everything at checkout.
[00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:19.039]  It's just automatic and 40% off on the t-shirts and hats.
[00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:24.650]  35% off on the hoodies, 30% off on the supplement bundle on top of the other specials.
[00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:36.390]  And VIP members will be emailed the link where you'll either have $30, $40, or $50 extra on top of the $40 you get a month being a VIP to spend on the store for $30 a month you spend.
[00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:38.910]  And you get all those other great specials, cancel anytime.
[00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.509]  All at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:29:51.210 --> 00:30:06.210]  There's an actual photo on screen of Michael Bloomberg and his Everytown gun control group that replaced me with Adam Lanza, raised hundreds of millions of dollars off of claiming I was victimizing families of the victims, and then did PR for years, raising money,
[00:30:06.329 --> 00:30:10.750]  and then finally sued me, had judges find me a default, and then had HBO produce show trials.
[00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:22.329]  I am so honored to be at the center of the most insane show trials in world history produced by HBO. Amazing.
[00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:27.750]  Because the lawfare is one of the main reasons Trump got elected again and overrode the fraud.
[00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:34.630]  It's one of the main reasons in big surveys of why people are having a political realignment, not just here, but around the Western world.
[00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.950]  We have the Democrats saying, we are here to silence him.
[00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.670]  We don't want money.
[00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:39.809]  We want him off the air.
[00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.009]  We want to use this president to shut down everybody else.
[00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:54.930]  And they admit that all these suits and criminal charges against Trump were, quote, ankle bracelets like AOC. And Nancy Pelosi said, well, how's the ankle bracelet working out for you now?
[00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:05.769]  So, I laughed two years ago when they had the show trial where the jury was told I was guilty until proven how guilty, where I couldn't say I was innocent in all of this.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:14.299]  When the billions of dollars came in and then they asked for 2.76 trillion, the GDP of India, many times more than what Elon Musk is worth.
[00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:20.480]  And I laughed because I had no extra money in the account.
[00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.680]  I was actually upside down then.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.220]  Didn't even have the money to fully pay my lawyers.
[00:31:25.859 --> 00:31:27.980]  And I'd never had big sums of money.
[00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:32.099]  I had a nice house and, you know, like a four bedroom and a pool and stuff.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.119]  And, you know, drive a Dodge car and a Ford truck.
[00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:39.670]  And I was just like, okay, all right.
[00:31:40.069 --> 00:31:50.150]  And then later, you saw a few months ago, New York Times, after all the federal investigations and IRS audits and federal judge ordered three different outside audit groups, they said, wow, turns out Jones had meager assets and never had a lot of money.
[00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:53.589]  They knew that from their discovery over four years.
[00:31:54.650 --> 00:32:00.029]  They got all the discovery, and when it didn't show what they wanted, they just said, you're defaulted for no discovery.
[00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:04.130]  We know you are richer than anybody on earth.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.440]  And so I put a video out this morning.
[00:32:08.619 --> 00:32:09.859]  We'll play it here in just a moment.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.359]  It's two minutes long.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.380]  I'm going to Norm Pattis, my great constitutional lawyer from Connecticut, also a famous criminal lawyer.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.940]  And I said, look, they're going to rule against me.
[00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:25.220]  Now, they did give the doggie a bone, $1.5, $150 million.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:41.640]  Saying, well, the unfair trade practices, and we'll get Norm to describe that in a moment, but bottom line, just like New York went after Trump and a bunch of businesses left when they said Mar-Lago's worth $18 million when it's really worth $500 million conservatively, they said, man, if you start having courts go after legitimate businesses and real estate, people are going to leave.
[00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:41.960]  So...
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:50.019]  They've said, okay, you know, you can't claim because of his business of selling t-shirts and vitamins that has something to do with this.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.440]  So that $150 million is carved off.
[00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:55.380]  It doesn't matter $1.35 billion.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:07.759]  I mean, I never kept in all my years on air, 30 years on air, I probably made $55 million and about $20 million of that's gone to lawyers.
[00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:09.359]  So I had to make more money to fight.
[00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:10.759]  That's the funny thing.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.160]  All their attacks incentivize me to work even more to stay on air and fight them.
[00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:15.839]  It's hilarious.
[00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.119]  I'm like doomsday.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.259]  Every time they attack, I go, get bigger.
[00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:23.539]  So, the Lord works the mysterious ways.
[00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:26.140]  I'm actually, you know, they've convicted themselves.
[00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:29.220]  We got the 60-something page ruling from the appellate court.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.660]  We'll go to Norm Pattis here in just a moment.
[00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:32.339]  He's very busy, but we've got 20 minutes with him.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.680]  But here's my prediction an hour before the ruling here on X. Here it is.
[00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:56.809]  It's Friday, December 6, 2024. And reportedly in about an hour, The Connecticut Court of Appeals is about to rule on our appeal concerning the show trials that were conducted up in Connecticut.
[00:33:56.829 --> 00:34:02.630]  And by show trials, the judge had a whole bunch of hearings before she found me guilty.
[00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:12.550]  And then they had their official show trial, literally produced and run by HBO, where I couldn't put on evidence to defend myself, but they pretended to the jury that it was actually a real trial.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.780]  And then of course, a FBI agent never said his name, never talked about him.
[00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:23.969]  He got up there and said that one person called him to see if he was an FBI agent and for that I owe him $130 million.
[00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:40.829]  So I am making the prediction that the Court of Appeals will rule against me today because this thing has been political all along and the system that's in a lot of trouble right now because the world's waking up to lawfare is going to try to prop itself up.
[00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.730]  That's what collapsing tyrannies do.
[00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:47.800]  Now, maybe one in a million, maybe I'm wrong, but I just want all my enemies to understand this.
[00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:53.940]  The Democrats, Bloomberg that funded all this, you're the ones on trial.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.260]  And your lawfare, it's myself, Trump and others, is the reason this country is awakening.
[00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.559]  We're seeing a major political realignment.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.539]  Now, maybe we do get some justice there, but regardless, I don't have all this money.
[00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:07.210]  The, quote, plaintiffs don't want money.
[00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:08.030]  They've said that.
[00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:12.969]  They want to take me off the air, and that's not going to have my broadcast as bigger than ever.
[00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.829]  So, in the court of public opinion, I am innocent.
[00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.210]  I've not done the things they claim.
[00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:22.510]  Even the things I claim I did are protected under the First Amendment, and this is tyranny.
[00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.369]  Now, this is my prediction.
[00:35:24.949 --> 00:35:26.449]  We'll see if I'm proven wrong.
[00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.230]  I'm rarely wrong.
[00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:31.949]  I'd love to be proved wrong, but be sure to follow me on X at RealAlexJones and at AJNLive.
[00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:38.519]  Next Monday is the big hearing on the deep state, trying to take my identity in federal court.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.500]  And Elon Musk has come to my aid and a lot of others.
[00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:46.739]  And so there's gonna be some big announcements, some big developments, but the universe is a two way street.
[00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:47.880]  God bless you all.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.599]  Thank you for the support.
[00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:53.199]  I'll continue to fight for our blessed and precious constitutional republic.
[00:35:55.829 --> 00:36:00.769]  And now, Norm Pattis, we talked yesterday, and he said, yeah, they're going to rule against this.
[00:36:00.769 --> 00:36:02.250]  It just doesn't really matter.
[00:36:02.889 --> 00:36:04.369]  And we already know that.
[00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.670]  The system, once it goes all in, has to go all the way.
[00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.469]  And that's how history repeats itself.
[00:36:10.469 --> 00:36:11.550]  It only accelerates.
[00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:16.389]  When Princess Leia tells Governor Tarkin, Darth Vader...
[00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:18.380]  You can't win.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.539]  The tighter you squeeze, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.480]  Norm, give us your expert take on this.
[00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:26.059]  I know this only came out an hour ago.
[00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:27.719]  You've had time hopefully to read over it all.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.460]  But wow, what do you make of this?
[00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.929]  Well, you know, the good news is that the press got protection in this ruling.
[00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:48.630]  They tried to use the Unfair Trade Practices Act against you by saying that because you spread lies about Sandy Hook, therefore you were engaged in an unfair trade practice because some of your viewers bought your merchandise.
[00:36:48.989 --> 00:36:57.869]  We argued that that's a misapplication of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, and it does damage to the First Amendment and the right of people to speak their minds freely.
[00:36:58.099 --> 00:37:14.420]  And by the way, just to interrupt and I'll shut up, you predicted last night and this morning, we talked a lot, you said, I think they're going to go against us, but they said if they don't do the unfair trade practices, they have literally gutted the First Amendment and businesses, and everybody will flee Connecticut.
[00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.570]  No.
[00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:17.869]  Well, and they should have.
[00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.570]  I mean, this was a good ruling.
[00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:26.329]  As you pointed out moments ago, you know, $150 million when you're playing with monopoly money doesn't really matter.
[00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:27.769]  But the principle does.
[00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:37.210]  And so this case will stand for the proposition that people are free to speak their mind and support themselves as they have to by the sale of supplements and other products.
[00:37:37.329 --> 00:37:38.889]  And so I'm pleased by that.
[00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:40.849]  And I thought that was our strongest argument.
[00:37:41.449 --> 00:37:50.369]  As to the default in general, the court held that the discovery default, the dispute about discovery, was not a disproportionate sanction.
[00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.389]  And I'll go to my grave knowing otherwise.
[00:37:53.989 --> 00:38:02.309]  You provided depositions, sworn statements, hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands of emails and documents to the other side.
[00:38:02.429 --> 00:38:08.530]  They were permitted to use them any way they wanted against you, and you were prohibited from defending yourself.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.980]  So that simply isn't a trial.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.639]  The trial of the Sandy Hook plaintiffs resembled more of a wake than a trial.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:25.940]  There were occasions where, after witnesses testified, they walked up to their lawyers, the plaintiff's lawyers, the ambulance chasers in the courtroom, and gave them a hug in the jury's presence.
[00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:33.920]  In no other context, in no other trial that I've seen in more than 30 years of practice, was this kind of conduct tolerated.
[00:38:34.389 --> 00:38:47.769]  I saw lawyers for the plaintiff's lawyers arranging cameras before trial began, checking the view that the cameras would have of them as they stood at various locations in the courtroom.
[00:38:47.989 --> 00:39:05.670]  And lo and behold, when one of them went off on you and the judge ignored my objections to this unseemly behavior, So it's not an overstatement to call this a show trial.
[00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.090]  It's a miscarriage of justice and it sends shockwaves.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:25.300]  You're Connecticut lawyers because, as you pointed out, with respect to the FBI agent, you asserted that he was a lookalike and that perhaps the same person played the role of one of the fathers as did the FBI agent.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.239]  That's wrong.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.760]  Okay, if you've got to pay some damages for that, pay him a couple shekels or whatever it's worth.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.920]  But the point is, there's no way on earth That that's worth $130 million.
[00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.579]  But you're doing that for the sake of argument.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.500]  You asked him, did Jones ever say your name?
[00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:42.239]  Did Jones show you?
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.300]  I never talked about him.
[00:39:44.099 --> 00:39:44.960]  No, you didn't.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.079]  And there's me objecting to a court that couldn't hear.
[00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:49.059]  Yeah, but let's just be clear.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.380]  No one ever here said his name or showed him.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.559]  I didn't know who he was until he sued me.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.480]  But here's the problem, Alex, and this is where the rubber's going to meet the road.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.599]  There's a process in court known as remittator.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:10.920]  If a jury gets emotional and gives too much money beyond what shocks the judicial conscience, a court can trim damages awards.
[00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:21.769]  So I've had many plaintiff's awards trimmed from $2 million to $350,000, from $250,000 to $50,000.
[00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:29.750]  I've taken these appeals up to appellate courts in cases where people testified they were emotionally distraught or had suffered serious physical injuries.
[00:40:29.929 --> 00:40:31.690]  And nobody thought anything of it.
[00:40:32.059 --> 00:40:40.699]  In this case, the unnamed FBI agent who claimed that his reputation was destroyed got $130 million.
[00:40:41.179 --> 00:40:44.280]  And the appellate court said this didn't shock their conscience.
[00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:59.460]  Every plaintiff's lawyer in Connecticut is now chomping at the bit to get into a courtroom and rely on this decision as authority for the fact that a jury can go hog wild with a defendant's checkbook and there's not a damn thing a court can do about it.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.559]  So I think my prediction is that this case will now make Connecticut the new Galveston, Texas.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.980]  What am I referring to?
[00:41:06.559 --> 00:41:12.539]  Plaintiff lawyers talk about where to bring suits, where you're likely to get the best jury for a big damages award.
[00:41:12.679 --> 00:41:20.519]  And it used to be that a corporation was most vulnerable in Galveston, Texas, because that's where juries had a history of giving large verdicts.
[00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:22.119]  They may as well come to Connecticut.
[00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:27.340]  And by the way, it destroyed Galveston, Texas.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.559]  Keep going.
[00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:31.059]  I didn't know that.
[00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:36.239]  So I'll call this Ned Lamont's gift to the plaintiff's bar.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.260]  His court basically said, come to Connecticut, defendants' wallets.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.980]  It's open season on civil defendant wallets.
[00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.289]  We'll see.
[00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.690]  And then there were some tart observations about me.
[00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.849]  I continue to fight for my law license after your trial.
[00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.070]  You refer to lawfare.
[00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.130]  Judge Bellis and I didn't see eye to eye on much in that trial.
[00:41:57.269 --> 00:41:58.449]  She had the robe and the gavel.
[00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.070]  I didn't.
[00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.170]  She suspended me for six months thereafter.
[00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:03.650]  I got the appellate court to throw that out.
[00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:08.769]  We recently had another hearing, and now the state's only seeking 30 days.
[00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:10.090]  We're still fighting that.
[00:42:10.369 --> 00:42:18.510]  And this Supreme Court ruling just happened, with tart observations about me, just happened to come out while the court is considering those rulings.
[00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:25.530]  So, you know, sometimes you start to wonder, are these dots really just randomly connected or isn't there something going on behind the scenes?
[00:42:26.389 --> 00:42:27.989]  Well, look at Fannie Willis.
[00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.010]  Look at Letitia James.
[00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.869]  Look at Jack Smith.
[00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.530]  I mean, they were all meeting illegally.
[00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.150]  It's come out.
[00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.690]  They're, by the way, going to get indicted.
[00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:36.849]  They're talking about pardons for him now.
[00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:44.489]  At the White House, before the law fair, to quarterback and to coordinate all this.
[00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:49.070]  I, you know, I'm stunned by the pardons issues.
[00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:57.110]  As you know, I'm seeking pardons for some of the Proud Boys, Joe Biggs, who formerly of Infowars, Zach Rell, Dominic Pozzola.
[00:42:57.329 --> 00:43:00.809]  And we think there's a strong historical argument for pardons.
[00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:06.010]  I mean, yes, you probably know, I'm sure you know, but many of your listeners probably do as well.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:17.000]  But four years after the Civil War, virtually every rebel had been repatriated and the United States went about the business of making a nation out of a wounded group of people and we thrived for a century.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:27.400]  Four years after a six-hour riot We're still, the Justice Department is still prosecuting people, and people are spending decades behind bars.
[00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:33.139]  We've asked Donald Trump to make his first order of business a pardon of the January 6th defendants.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.760]  While we've done that, Joe Biden basically said, yeah, why not?
[00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:44.639]  I mean, all this talk about the Biden crime family doesn't look so crazy anymore when you see him pardoning his son.
[00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:48.900]  You know, we were joking around in the office the other day, maybe we'll start a tax practice.
[00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:56.239]  And on the bottom of my tax return, I'll say, I'm not paying for 2024 and sign my name, Hunter Biden.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.400]  Because if it's good enough for the president's son, it's good enough for me.
[00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:03.159]  Maybe it's time to redo the Creedence Clearwater revival song.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.260]  I ain't no president's son, not a senator's son.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.039]  I don't know.
[00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:19.929]  But with respect to, you know, the pardon process in general, You know, we remain optimistic for the Proud Boys, but the idea that Fauci needs to be pardoned, you know, we were told he did nothing wrong, so you're going to give a pardon?
[00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:23.530]  Fonny Willis or Jack Smith needs a pardon?
[00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:28.230]  We were told that no one was above the law and that it was important that the rule of law be honored.
[00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:32.289]  Now the prosecutor needs, what, immunity from prosecution?
[00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:39.489]  When nobody was above the law and he was prosecuting a presidential candidate in a way that was historically unprecedented in the United States?
[00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:43.730]  My tiny head is exploding while I watch all this happen.
[00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:48.889]  But as to your case, Alex, you know, our intention is to go to the Connecticut Supreme Court.
[00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:56.989]  We have 20 days to file what's called a petition for certification, and we will ask the court to review certain parts of the appellate court ruling.
[00:44:57.199 --> 00:45:18.619]  Certainly, the disproportionate character or result or impact of the default ruling will be issue number one, and second, a remititor of the damages, because quite frankly, if this decision is allowed to stand, there's not a corporation or a defendant that's going to want to do business in Connecticut when the courts have basically said it's fantasy land at the time of trial.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.179]  Yes, you know, in my opinion, at least I live here in Connecticut, you know, and I think it's well established.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:26.579]  There was a shooting at Sandy Hook.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.500]  People died.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:36.139]  You may have erred in some of your coverage of it, but the real Sandy Hook hoax right now is the verdict and what that jury was led to believe.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.400]  This remains, in my view...
[00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:40.530]  A shocking injustice.
[00:45:53.929 --> 00:46:00.750]  We couldn't even tell the jury that you had a liability default as a result of a discovery violation.
[00:46:00.789 --> 00:46:07.170]  The court told everybody that your fault had been established, and we weren't permitted to challenge that.
[00:46:07.449 --> 00:46:09.130]  That's just not justice.
[00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:17.130]  You know, the fact-finding process, the adversarial process of a trial, was transformed into a little more than a maudlin wake.
[00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:23.530]  And the result of it was that Lady Justice, if she wasn't weeping now, or then, she should be weeping now.
[00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:41.300]  Norm, you brought something up that I was talking to you about last week and then earlier, because I want to do a full interview on this, and I want to be able to get the documents and talk about the individuals, and I've been waiting to see what I was going to hear from Trump.
[00:46:42.239 --> 00:46:48.639]  He has said he wants everybody that's, quote, innocent or who had their rights violated released, and of course, if...
[00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:54.070]  It's better that 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man be put in prison.
[00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.730]  And you use a Civil War historical parallel that's even more powerful.
[00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:02.690]  And I know you basically for no money, you did for that.
[00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.550]  Inside baseball, I know it's basically financially destroyed you.
[00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.530]  That's what a good guy you are.
[00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.789]  I don't know if I let out some inside stuff, but you represented...
[00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:11.909]  A bunch of the Proud Boys and everybody haven't even been paid.
[00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.449]  You did that for years.
[00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:15.150]  That's what a patriot you are.
[00:47:15.389 --> 00:47:18.690]  But you are really one of the key insiders on what really happened.
[00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.289]  I would like to do a full hour with you soon.
[00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:32.130]  Send me your exhibits, your document points, your things, because now is the time to talk about the J6ers and Trump so we can get this report to Trump.
[00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:37.559]  Because some of his people are saying, you know, well, if you can't prove each person is totally innocent, don't give him a pardon.
[00:47:37.719 --> 00:47:40.420]  Well, if the process was a fraud to begin with, you have to let him go.
[00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:46.460]  You have the Democrats, you know, having people in the burndown federal buildings getting no time.
[00:47:46.599 --> 00:47:51.519]  You have then-candidate Harris bailing him out, or then-vice-president Harris bailing him out.
[00:47:52.239 --> 00:47:53.639]  We've seen all of this.
[00:47:54.099 --> 00:47:57.980]  And so it's the right thing to do to just pardon all of them, unconditional, across the board.
[00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:07.260]  And that gives a lot of support to what Trump's doing with these blanket preemptive pardons and the rest of it.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.960]  So let's pick a time.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.280]  Okay, I would love to do that.
[00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:15.349]  Well, I'm going to do a special emergency show from 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:20.130]  tomorrow out of the Alex Jones Network Studios in case we get shut down with a bad ruling Monday in federal court.
[00:48:20.269 --> 00:48:20.690]  It could happen.
[00:48:20.869 --> 00:48:22.869]  I don't think it'll happen because of what they've done so outrageous.
[00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.090]  I think they're actually going to get in a lot of trouble, but cross our fingers and say a prayer.
[00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:31.489]  But let me know if you can come on, let's say 3 o'clock Central tomorrow.
[00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:34.090]  If you can't do that, maybe the Sunday show, but...
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.679]  Can we do something on Sunday?
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.559]  Because I've got commitments all day tomorrow, and I've got a wife that runs my Saturdays.
[00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:41.539]  No, no, I understand.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.739]  Okay, well, let's look at an hour Sunday night.
[00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:44.880]  Norm, we'll talk to you.
[00:48:45.039 --> 00:48:45.599]  God bless you.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:47.539 --> 00:48:53.780]  Thank you, because we need to get this January 6th info out, and then I'm going to get it to Don Jr., Musk, and I can get it directly to Trump.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.420]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.219]  Okay.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.480]  All right.
[00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.170]  Let me talk about something here.
[00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:12.710]  I'm going to come back, hit massive news, angles of the enemy operations that they can't stand to have get out.
[00:49:12.969 --> 00:49:17.210]  That's why they want me off the air, because I've got their number, I've got their name, I've got their ass, as you know.
[00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:19.909]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:49:19.969 --> 00:49:22.030]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.030]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists, thanks to your support.
[00:49:26.389 --> 00:49:28.860]  So, We need to stay on air.
[00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:30.500]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:34.480]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:49:34.519 --> 00:49:39.500]  And I told you, we're not just going to have patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:43.460]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:49:43.579 --> 00:49:45.059]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:52.929]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30-40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:49:53.269 --> 00:49:54.829]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:49:54.969 --> 00:49:58.309]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.210]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:50:01.429 --> 00:50:03.329]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:05.230]  Unfortunately...
[00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:10.250]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:16.349]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:17.170]  That continues.
[00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:18.489]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.150]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:22.989]  I designed it.
[00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:29.250]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:31.469]  And they are a fundraiser.
[00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:32.949]  They are a piece of history.
[00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.949]  They are pure silver.
[00:50:35.269 --> 00:50:37.869]  They are minted here in America.
[00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.210]  2,000 of these.
[00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.650]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.050]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:48.289]  They are incredible.
[00:50:48.570 --> 00:51:03.210]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com and it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the AlexShonesStore.com.
[00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.510]  That is our main sponsor with the AlexShones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.469]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:20.050]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, we have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between $9.95 and $14.95.
[00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:25.730]  When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.349]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[00:51:28.489 --> 00:51:29.230]  Don't tread on me.
[00:51:29.989 --> 00:51:32.170]  1776. Another one with Alex Jones.
[00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:32.969]  You're truly on it.
[00:51:34.449 --> 00:51:37.730]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.269]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:47.289]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.429]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:52.599]  They surprised me with this.
[00:51:52.699 --> 00:51:53.679]  I just learned this morning.
[00:51:53.699 --> 00:52:00.400]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:03.599]  When I saw this, I went, this is going to be a bestseller.
[00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:04.760]  This could solve all our problems.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.719]  But I was like, wait, it's 1995?
[00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:07.869]  How much does it cost you?
[00:52:07.969 --> 00:52:10.110]  Well, it costs us like nine bucks.
[00:52:10.389 --> 00:52:11.730]  Okay, we'll make some money.
[00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.250]  I said, how many did you make?
[00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:14.789]  Two thousand?
[00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:16.110]  This will sell today.
[00:52:16.409 --> 00:52:17.489]  So it's a great thing.
[00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:18.469]  It'd be a great fundraiser.
[00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.289]  It's a great idea, but they didn't get enough of them.
[00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:23.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a stump.
[00:52:23.369 --> 00:52:24.389]  Can we show some B-roll?
[00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:27.289]  1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:30.730]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:52:30.869 --> 00:52:34.070]  Oh, my daughter loves, my seven-year-old loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.809]  We play with him, do all sorts of stuff.
[00:52:36.569 --> 00:52:37.510]  Catapult from around the house.
[00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:38.889]  Cats play with them.
[00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:41.210]  We probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf.
[00:52:41.289 --> 00:52:42.730]  Both little Elf Village in the backyard.
[00:52:42.929 --> 00:52:43.489]  We had a lot of fun.
[00:52:43.909 --> 00:52:47.449]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:48.449]  Oh my gosh.
[00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.530]  I've got to have this.
[00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:50.349]  And I already called them.
[00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:52.489]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:56.889]  So that means there's 1,900 and something of these.
[00:52:56.989 --> 00:52:59.670]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.530]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:03.809]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:53:03.989 --> 00:53:05.010]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:06.769]  This baby is amazing.
[00:53:06.969 --> 00:53:15.289]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a stump Christmas figurine.

[00:53:36.489 --> 00:53:45.570]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump being inaugurated next month.

[00:54:09.559 --> 00:54:12.719]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:54:13.099 --> 00:54:15.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.739]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[00:54:18.179 --> 00:54:24.219]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:54:24.679 --> 00:54:27.519]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.920]  We're going to be very transparent.
[00:54:29.139 --> 00:54:30.039]  We're going to get behind.
[00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:33.460]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[00:54:33.659 --> 00:54:35.219]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:39.469]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.949]  Again, by design.
[00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.610]  And so much more has happened.
[00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:43.650]  This is an exciting time.
[00:54:43.869 --> 00:54:45.849]  But the globalists are striking back.
[00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:49.929]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.909]  And we can't do it without you.
[00:54:51.989 --> 00:54:52.889]  So we make it easy.

[00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:17.769]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[00:55:17.949 --> 00:55:20.230]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.550]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:23.349]  And this will horrify.
[00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:28.429]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fearing and walking on the streets.
[00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.110]  Say, it's okay.
[00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:34.210]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.

[00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.190]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:58:49.409 --> 00:58:52.730]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.769]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[00:58:55.889 --> 00:58:57.750]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[00:58:58.269 --> 00:59:07.530]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:08.889]  We're going to be very transparent.
[00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:10.030]  We're going to get behind.
[00:59:10.329 --> 00:59:13.469]  What did the United Nations have to do with this open border crisis?
[00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.230]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[00:59:15.369 --> 00:59:19.489]  We're going to be very transparent to American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:20.969]  Again, by design.
[00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:22.630]  And so much more has happened.
[00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:23.650]  This is an exciting time.
[00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:25.849]  But the globalists are striking back.

[01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:08.429]  And this will horrify Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking in fear when you're walking on the street.
[01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:09.130]  Say, it's okay.
[01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:14.210]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:20.829]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.

[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.139]  And I looked at it and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.

[01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:34.670]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:38.409]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:42.909]  All right, we're going to break for one minute.
[01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:48.650]  We're gonna come back and cover all the massive news and so much more.

[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.090]  Merry Christmas, everybody.
[01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:54.610]  We love you, and I love the crew.
[01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:57.190]  So much great work to do.
[01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:04.550]  We are now into our number two of this Friday, December 6, 2024 transmission.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:14.059]  And I am your host, Alexander Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.659]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:30.480]  I already covered a lot of important news last hour, but I want to drill into some of the big subjects more and then get into a bunch of other really important topics that we need to get to.
[01:03:30.539 --> 01:03:33.199]  And we got some really bad news out of Canada.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.500]  And one reason I harp on this is it's key.
[01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.480]  And I don't think it's my opinion.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.559]  I know I'm right.
[01:03:41.659 --> 01:03:44.039]  And I see this everywhere.
[01:03:45.719 --> 01:03:47.400]  So this is bigger than Canada.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:50.679]  This is bigger than just national gun confiscation announced.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:51.760]  They're basically taking all the guns.
[01:03:54.570 --> 01:04:05.170]  It's bigger than the fact that Canada is the testing ground, the WEF, and this has been done all over the world as well, and it's the same plan they have for here, so we can look at what the enemy's doing and understand how they operate.
[01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.530]  But it's even bigger than that.
[01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:16.329]  It is so fundamental, not mainly with our audience, but still with some of our listeners and viewers, because I get the feedback, but not anywhere near the general public.
[01:04:16.469 --> 01:04:20.630]  I mean, I'd say it's 50 times?
[01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:23.150]  That's a guesstimation of 80 times?
[01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.590]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.429]  It's way worse in the general public in America.
[01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.130]  And it's bad all over the world.
[01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:45.309]  And there's a lot of studies and a lot of history and a lot of analysis of this by philosophers and psychologists and psychiatrists and just people that are observant of human activity and are street smarts.
[01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:59.210]  That if a nation has empathy and is informed and engaged, you have a vibrant, free, dynamic, renaissance-based culture.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:13.780]  But when you don't have that, things begin to degenerate and then it just gets worse and worse because there's one evil group in power and then they get replaced by even more evil people and then it's a survival of the most evil.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.119]  And then you get hellish stuff.
[01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:22.860]  And hellish governments and hellish societies are the most common.
[01:05:23.679 --> 01:05:42.409]  In between, corrupt societies are also more common We're good to go.
[01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.969]  You know, your main audience is America.
[01:05:55.969 --> 01:05:58.190]  And I'm like, here's the analogy I always use.
[01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:59.110]  Most solicitors have heard this.
[01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:13.610]  If Martians showed up and blew up Paris today, a big flying saucer flies up and like Independence Day and vaporizes Paris, would you say, well, I don't care about the Parisians.
[01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:14.690]  I don't care about the French.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.199]  No, you'd be like, oh my God, aliens just blew up Paris, we're next.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:30.019]  I mean, you'd care about the women and children and men dying, but you'd really be concerned because you'd have empathy going, my God, what the hell's going on here?
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.820]  Now, that's just an analogy, a science fiction analogy.
[01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:49.650]  But when you understand that the BlackRock mega-private central bank cartel, because State Street, Vanguard, BlackRock have 87% of the world's assets, it's the same shareholders, the same group.
[01:06:52.690 --> 01:07:02.530]  They've decided to take over everything and control your behavior with a cashless society social credit score in their own policy reports, their own papers, their own statements.
[01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:03.809]  I've shown the reports.
[01:07:03.989 --> 01:07:04.610]  I've played the clips.
[01:07:04.949 --> 01:07:06.130]  All of you know about this.
[01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.929]  This is not a secret.
[01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.010]  I was talking about it 25 years ago.
[01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:14.630]  Their plan for cashless society that monitors all your behavior and live time and controls everything you can buy and sell.
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:21.670]  I'd love to say I broke that, but actually John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos 2,000 years ago did.
[01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:45.760]  So, when people say, we don't care about what's happening in Canada, or we don't care about what's happening in the UK, or we don't care about what's happening in New Zealand, the same globalist groups get up on TV,
[01:07:46.139 --> 01:07:53.139]  and we have all the documents knowing they're telling the truth about this, and brag that we now control half the cabinets of the earth.
[01:07:55.059 --> 01:07:56.739]  Soon the public will own nothing.
[01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.320]  We're going to make them eat bugs.
[01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:09.380]  He said that six years ago, and they put it out as a policy video in 2018. And we showed it and showed it, and look, they're going to make them eat bugs.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.659]  We're like, I will never eat bugs.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.860]  Come on, Alex.
[01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:15.289]  They had, I think it was like raw story, leftist articles.
[01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:17.289]  Jones says they're going to make us eat bugs.
[01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:21.449]  Jones says they're going to ban your dog and cat carbon footprint.
[01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:22.569]  It was in the documents.
[01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.449]  Now it's happening all over the world.
[01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:29.010]  Jones crazily says they're going to ban space heaters and rain stoves and fireplaces.
[01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:33.609]  It's been done all over Western Europe, San Francisco, New York.
[01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:34.550]  It's all happening.
[01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.010]  So let me tell you something.
[01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:40.649]  I started waking up 40 years ago.
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:46.810]  When I was 10 years old, you're like, that's weird.
[01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:48.590]  It wasn't weird.
[01:08:49.210 --> 01:09:12.439]  My family, my mother's brother, my dad, a bunch of my dad's family had been here in Texas during the 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s when there was a total mobilization against the USSR. Of human intelligence and didn't have all the signals and spying and AI then.
[01:09:12.699 --> 01:09:18.119]  And so there was a mass recruitment of people supposedly to fight the Russians.
[01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:22.520]  And so Texas was the main recruitment state.
[01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:28.399]  And so a whole bunch of my family had already been recruited before Reagan came in to fight communists.
[01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:36.220]  My dad, when he was 15, was doing radio shows in Dallas every week about fighting the communists.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:56.159]  And the reason I raised that is, I was raised knowing about this, but you're a kid, it's like your parents are like, yeah, okay, yeah, the New World Order, Global Government, Council Society, UN running everything, okay, yeah, you don't think your parents are wrong, you just grow up hearing about it, and then you get a little bit older and you start seeing it,
[01:09:56.199 --> 01:10:02.000]  you're in middle school and their brain was saying America's evil and white people are bad, that stuff's always been going on for 50 years.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.020]  And you go, man, my grandfathers are right.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.220]  My grandmothers are right.
[01:10:07.359 --> 01:10:08.220]  My dad's right.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.199]  My uncle's right.
[01:10:09.319 --> 01:10:10.220]  My cousin's right.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.420]  My great uncle's right.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:25.159]  And so I started reading when I was 10, but really got into it by about 15. Books by the globalists, not even books by patriots.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.899]  And it was fascinating.
[01:10:26.899 --> 01:10:28.420]  They're horrible plans for us.
[01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:29.939]  And I'm like, these are real supervillains.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.859]  Because I liked science fiction and comic books before that.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.399]  Because it was like archetypal villains and good guys.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.359]  Everybody loves that.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.220]  I'm like, well, this is actually the real ones.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.819]  This is art imitating life.
[01:10:41.989 --> 01:10:47.310]  There's a reason Klaus Schwab looks like Blofeld from James Bond or Lex Luthor.
[01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:52.189]  That's the comic book people basing it on what the real people are like.
[01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:56.250]  And Ian Fleming, that was the deputy head of OSS and MI6 later, said that.
[01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.630]  You know, he wrote the James Bond books.
[01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:09.529]  So my point is, you see all this in culture and art and life, and they do that on purpose because then you think, oh, that's a movie, that's a book, that's not, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:14.729]  Thanos wants to kill half the beings in the universe to save the environment.
[01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:20.289]  Well, the globalists want to kill 90% of us publicly to save the environment.
[01:11:21.949 --> 01:11:30.109]  So you go see a movie made eight, nine years after I made Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and then Marvel comes out with Endgame.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.140]  And then later I talked to the writers.
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.640]  They said, oh yeah, your movie inspired that.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.619]  It's not about name dropping.
[01:11:35.159 --> 01:11:37.319]  It's about understanding all of this.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.140]  And I talked to the same people that wrote the part of writing the Captain America Winter Soldier.
[01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:44.600]  They said, oh yeah, your show's the big inspiration for this.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:50.380]  And what Chris Carter said, his 2016 relaunch of X-Files was based on my show.
[01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:55.819]  But it's not about me saying, oh, aren't I cool?
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.960]  What I'm saying to you is, this is on record.
[01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:06.470]  Because they're already authorized to green light all these productions.
[01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.930]  You'd say, well, those productions are going to expose it.
[01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:21.470]  And even though Chris Carter is a good guy and is a libertarian, he knows full well he's been greenlit to make these things from his perspective to warn you and from the globalist perspective, subconsciously to prepare you, predictive programming.
[01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:28.829]  That's why I'm saying you've got to be conscious of all this or it affects you for when the real thing's happening, your brain is already accustomed to it and ready for it.
[01:12:29.329 --> 01:12:29.869]  All right?
[01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:45.970]  So, what the globalists did taking over China with Mao Zedong in 49 and then letting him kill 80 million of his own people and then by the mid-70s setting them up through the 90s and 2000s to be the dominant force, that affects us, doesn't it?
[01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:50.710]  Not just, oh, the poor Chinese enslaved by that and one-child policies and death camps and slave labor.
[01:12:51.989 --> 01:12:57.050]  They then use that to leverage us out and take our jobs away and then bring us on the path to total enslavement.
[01:12:57.949 --> 01:13:12.989]  So when you see the formula Of Canada registering guns five years ago, then banning one type, two types, five types, 50 types,
[01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:21.229]  60 types, 80 types, 150 types, and now 324 more types, basically all the guns.
[01:13:21.329 --> 01:13:27.050]  Now they're down to bolt-action single shots and saying no more gun sales, period.
[01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:32.550]  It's the formula they used in Germany.
[01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:36.989]  The formula they used in the UK. The formula they used in Australia.
[01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:39.590]  You know the real Crocodile Dundee.
[01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.310]  Really wrestled alligators, crocodiles, not alligators.
[01:13:42.909 --> 01:13:43.869]  Alligators are here.
[01:13:45.289 --> 01:13:46.869]  Looked just like that guy.
[01:13:47.109 --> 01:13:48.710]  Was a hero in the country.
[01:13:48.949 --> 01:13:50.329]  Was an outback guide.
[01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:56.649]  Was in the late 90s.
[01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:57.770]  You look this up.
[01:13:58.489 --> 01:14:01.210]  Just type in real, you're probably going to click Google Images, it's so old.
[01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.989]  Real Crocodile Dundee killed in police shootout.
[01:14:06.029 --> 01:14:10.529]  And first, you know, they took the semi-autos, and then they said, now we're taking your bull to action.
[01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:11.289]  He said, bull.
[01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.289]  So the police came to his house, shot up his house out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:14:14.489 --> 01:14:16.609]  He shot and killed a couple of them, and then they got him.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:33.760]  But the point is, is that it's the same projects, the same operations, the same plan, the same groups, the same international organizations that are bringing in the casual society, and the surveillance, and the censorship, and the gun confiscation,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.880]  and the transgenderism, and the open borders.
[01:14:41.819 --> 01:14:51.649]  Yep, real Crocodile Dundee shot dead after Rampage, 1999. So, this is a program.
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:53.069]  This is an operation.
[01:14:56.609 --> 01:14:57.710]  And I played the clip.
[01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:58.710]  You want to hear Klaus Schwab say?
[01:14:59.569 --> 01:15:00.510]  We're taking over.
[01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:01.609]  We have the same agenda everywhere.
[01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:02.630]  We penetrate the cabinets.
[01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:03.869]  We have half the cabinets control.
[01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:05.670]  Well, who is your best guy?
[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:07.229]  Who do you see as the best?
[01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:12.149]  Oh, I see Justin Trudeau as the best example.
[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.149]  The guy said, I'll play the clip again.
[01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:17.449]  What former government, what do you admire the most?
[01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:27.310]  And he said, right when he got into office, he said, well, I see China's basic dictatorship because you can get things done.
[01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:33.510]  Now, look what he did to the truckers.
[01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:35.170]  Look what he did with the horses attacking men and children.
[01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:37.010]  People are totally peaceful.
[01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:40.989]  Look at how he lets the Islamists be all violent, but nobody else can even peacefully protest.
[01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:46.510]  What you see in him is what they want to do to us.
[01:15:47.659 --> 01:15:51.840]  And most listeners are like, yeah, now you're telling us the sun shines in the sky.
[01:15:51.979 --> 01:15:52.479]  We know that.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.399]  Well, the general public tunes in by the millions every day.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.680]  They don't even understand this.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.779]  I hear people all the time like, I don't care if the stock market crashes.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.279]  I don't own any stock.
[01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:11.159]  Do I need to explain to those people that more than half the jobs in this country are...
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.960]  Available and based on the stock market for investment in the companies and operation.
[01:16:17.279 --> 01:16:23.239]  And then if it crashes, like in 1929, you'll be lucky if you don't starve to death.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.800]  We were 80% rural in 1929. 20% urban.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.699]  Half the people in the rural areas roughly were self-sufficient.
[01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:36.600]  40% of the public was self-sufficient.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.520]  The other 40% somewhat.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.180]  20% in the cities.
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:46.600]  And there are major university estimates that over 7 million people starved to death during the Great Depression for those 10 years.
[01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:57.859]  We are now 80 plus percent urban, 15 percent or so rural, and maybe half of those are rural.
[01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:00.569]  Self-sufficient.
[01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.350]  And it was even worse.
[01:17:01.489 --> 01:17:04.510]  Five years ago, it was 90% were urban, 10% rural.
[01:17:04.649 --> 01:17:06.989]  Half of them were somewhat self-sufficient.
[01:17:07.649 --> 01:17:07.970]  5%.
[01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:11.449]  But more people have gotten smart and moved and figuring out how dangerous the cities are.
[01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.930]  People instinctively have this, oh, I better get the hell out of here.
[01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:15.270]  Yeah.
[01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.590]  I better get some chickens and I better start canning stuff and I better learn how to skin a buck and run a trot line.
[01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:20.329]  Yeah, you better.
[01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.590]  So...
[01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.970]  The globalists are positioning the world to make you dependent, to make you not self-sufficient.
[01:17:30.109 --> 01:17:31.930]  That's their main goal, domestication.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:41.199]  And so we need solidarity with people in Africa under globalist attack like Nigeria with the Castro Society already put in place there.
[01:17:41.359 --> 01:17:44.479]  We need solidarity with people in Brazil under communist dictatorship.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.479]  We need solidarity with people in Canada under communist dictatorship.
[01:17:49.319 --> 01:17:56.460]  Trudeau is admitted communist and wants dictatorship and got 18% of the vote in his party but manipulated things where he's still in power.
[01:17:56.579 --> 01:17:58.479]  Just like Netanyahu got 18%.
[01:17:58.479 --> 01:18:00.680]  Just like Macron got, what, 17%.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.359]  18% for Keira Starmer.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.640]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:18:09.939 --> 01:18:12.859]  Change the party rules in all the countries where they can stay in power.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:27.279]  Because the party with the most seniority gets more seats and more votes for the Prime Minister than the other parties.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.279]  Oh, you can get 40% in those countries.
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.420]  Like France, sorry, Macron's still in there.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.359]  18 was a 17%.
[01:18:34.359 --> 01:18:36.060]  Look up his last election.
[01:18:36.199 --> 01:18:42.359]  I think it was 17 or 18. So, these are real dictators.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:54.180]  I mean, you know Hitler was elected, right, as the president in 1933. Then Kaiser Wilhelm was the chancellor and had Alzheimer's and was basically a vegetable.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:59.239]  And then his people said, oh yeah, he signed the decree.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.119]  They just signed it for him.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:16.659]  And then Hitler became the president and the chancellor on February 28th, 1933, the day after the Reichstag fire, and became the leader or the Führer.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.119]  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.560]  And so you've got the metrosexual Trudeau.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.680]  And he's all, little pink ties.
[01:19:31.859 --> 01:19:32.319]  I'm not threatening.
[01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:33.699]  Bill Gates, oh God, I'm liberal.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.939]  And he was wearing a Hugo Boss black uniform.
[01:19:40.079 --> 01:19:41.520]  He'd be gone by now.
[01:19:41.659 --> 01:19:48.199]  But because he sashays and candy asses around, that is all a cover.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.119]  And that's why Klaus Schwab says he's perfect.
[01:19:50.579 --> 01:19:51.500]  He's perfect.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:52.880]  He's the model.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.180]  You want to see the clip?
[01:19:55.869 --> 01:19:58.770]  Talking to David Gergen four years ago at the Kennedy Center.
[01:20:00.609 --> 01:20:13.109]  Non-threatening, effeminate man or women is who they're putting in charge as the puppets because when you look at Jacinda Arden saying, don't look at the sun, don't talk to your neighbors, I am your only one source of information, listen to no one but me.
[01:20:13.829 --> 01:20:23.350]  If it's a guy with big sunglasses and a Jim Jones come over, you're like, I'm in Guyana, I better, what's coming out, the cyanide Kool-Aid next?
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.619]  New York Times, don't ask questions.
[01:20:26.779 --> 01:20:27.779]  Time to get rid of the Constitution.
[01:20:28.939 --> 01:20:30.079]  The truth is bad.
[01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.039]  The truth is inconvenient.
[01:20:31.079 --> 01:20:32.239]  These are all real headlines.
[01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:33.159]  Look them up.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:40.819]  Yeah, no, that was earlier.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.619]  They just had another one.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:48.380]  It's the last time he got less than 20. All right, so continuing here.
[01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:59.010]  We need to understand what we're up against.
[01:21:00.869 --> 01:21:07.510]  And we need to let everybody know, and I'm going to talk about this when we come back, this is really important.
[01:21:08.369 --> 01:21:09.729]  Listen to me very carefully.
[01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:23.510]  We need people to convert to common sense, to being pro-human, to being pro-God, pro-family, just believing in humanity and understanding the people we have running things are psychotic demons.
[01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:47.470]  And as things get worse and worse under their control, I predicted, and of course it happened, it's not hard to predict, the majority of people are waking up and getting up to speed, understand that, but we really need to not just have Bill Maher pay lip service or Fetterman or Bezos or Zuckerberg and say,
[01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:51.109]  okay, Trump's good, we want to be friendly so they can keep their government contracts.
[01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:54.170]  We need them to really come over.
[01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:59.770]  And Betterman said on Joe Rogan, he said, look, my son really loves you.
[01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:01.989]  He hates, you know, what's going on in the country.
[01:22:01.989 --> 01:22:06.310]  And so I, you know, I want to join Team Humanity.
[01:22:06.609 --> 01:22:08.130]  I don't know if that's for real or not.
[01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:11.069]  He still supports the Democrats' evil policies, but we'll see.
[01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:19.010]  And I know for a fact, you know, people like Governor Newsom call up Rogan and just beg to come on and beg him to, you know, my kid really likes you.
[01:22:19.069 --> 01:22:19.710]  Come on, stop.
[01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:27.510]  So these people are susceptible to, To their survival instinct and their family putting pressure on them.
[01:22:27.689 --> 01:22:33.630]  And as the globalists lose their power, they're going to come over to us, but they still have their globalist evil instincts.
[01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:40.789]  They're still weak people that fell to this control and were selected because of the fact that they were puppets.
[01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:46.310]  And so I'm simply saying...
[01:22:48.539 --> 01:22:55.960]  Bare minimum, they get a long time out from society and culture that should be shunned and not trusted and don't turn your back on them.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.500]  And then we should tell them, we expect pittance.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:13.699]  We expect you to come out against the globalists and to viciously attack them politically and to show yourself by your works that you're on our team.
[01:23:13.699 --> 01:23:15.460]  And then we're still never going to trust you.
[01:23:16.579 --> 01:23:25.920]  But then you won't be, just through cultural action, not government, anathema.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:39.659]  And then maybe after 10 years of you fighting for us, you know, we're not going to turn our back, but we'll not just stare at you straight on in a fighting stance when you're around.
[01:23:41.119 --> 01:23:43.500]  Because that's where this is going.
[01:23:43.579 --> 01:23:45.140]  Some will say, well, screw them, put them all in prison.
[01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:48.869]  That'll keep them in the enemy camp.
[01:23:48.989 --> 01:23:52.050]  I've studied warfare, history, daytime, capitulation.
[01:23:53.289 --> 01:24:01.529]  We need to say, if you keep serving the enemy, now that you claim you're on our team, now you're really involved in treason, and we're going to come after you, legally and lawfully.
[01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:08.810]  If you really want to prove yourself, come in for the big win, because our enemies aren't defeated yet, they're very dangerous, and you've figured that out now.
[01:24:08.989 --> 01:24:14.350]  So if you want self-preservation, come in and join Team Humanity and show your worth and prove yourself.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.439]  That's what needs to be done.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:35.020]  So it's a balancing act there, but this is what we need to then point out them capitulating to common sense and survival and life force and survival instincts and point out to all the other dumbasses and say, why don't you come join us now,
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:35.399]  idiots?
[01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:40.449]  I mean, you see we're winning and we just want to promote freedom and security and prosperity.
[01:24:40.829 --> 01:24:41.550]  Come on!
[01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:42.250]  Join us!
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.850]  Come on!

[01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:48.409]  America and the world has been through hell.
[01:24:48.609 --> 01:24:49.890]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[01:24:50.069 --> 01:24:51.930]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[01:24:52.109 --> 01:25:04.640]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most Powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the team humanity agenda on air.

[01:25:41.489 --> 01:25:44.229]  We have two new campaign coins.

[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:11.420]  Messages.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.619]  They weigh a lot.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.300]  They feel good.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.119]  They're a great gift.
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.979]  They're a great memento.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.220]  They're a great keepsake.
[01:26:17.359 --> 01:26:19.260]  They're a great conversation starter.

[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:56.720]  And I have to say, when I mention now names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[01:26:59.569 --> 01:27:12.369]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:32.689]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I... We know that half of this cabinet, or even more half of this cabinet, are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:35.270]  And that's true in Argentina, too.
[01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:35.829]  Wow.
[01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.850]  Sorry.
[01:27:37.029 --> 01:27:38.430]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:48.590]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now, I mean, with the president, who is a young global leader, but what is important for me...
[01:27:48.590 --> 01:28:01.579]  I couldn't imagine Anybody who could represent more the world which will come out of this fourth industrial revolution.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:07.819]  It certainly will be a world, hopefully, not certainly, hopefully, if it takes the right decisions.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.920]  Which will be a diverse world, characterized by plurality.
[01:28:15.539 --> 01:28:32.319]  It will be a world which will combine significant investments into the future, into our soft and hard infrastructure, with fostering entrepreneurial activity,
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.699]  at the same time social responsibility.
[01:28:36.439 --> 01:28:41.489]  It will be a young world It will be a digital world.
[01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:49.479]  Now, who could represent Such a world better than you, Prime Minister.
[01:28:49.779 --> 01:28:54.140]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:28:56.199 --> 01:29:07.920]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start investing in solar.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:14.319]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[01:29:15.329 --> 01:29:29.609]  I am so happy to be where I'm at, in the fight, in the heart of the resistance against the globalist death cult, talking to tens of millions of men, women, and children of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love God.
[01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:40.430]  Whatever happens to me at the end of this, don't put on my tombstone what we know will be on Arnold Schwarzenegger's.
[01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:42.670]  Screw your freedom!
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.079]  On my tombstone, I did it for freedom!
[01:29:48.439 --> 01:29:50.039]  Freedom all the way!
[01:29:50.319 --> 01:29:51.460]  Freedom forever!
[01:29:53.159 --> 01:29:54.720]  Under God!
[01:29:57.899 --> 01:30:06.899]  Yes, you are given free will and appointed once to live in a test so you can choose your destiny.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.939]  Choose wisely, my friends.
[01:30:10.359 --> 01:30:20.060]  I've chosen my destiny and it is pure completion, satisfaction, will, strength, honor.
[01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:32.350]  We're taking you right into the danger zone because you're already in the danger zone.
[01:30:32.529 --> 01:30:34.270]  You better know you're in the danger zone.
[01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:35.930]  Look at this planet.
[01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.789]  Look at space.
[01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:39.670]  Look at the fantastic nature of consciousness.
[01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:43.310]  Don't be afraid of it.
[01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:50.550]  Take that intergalactic spacewalk into eternity and join God.
[01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:56.350]  Take God's spiritual hand in the stairway to heaven.
[01:31:08.579 --> 01:31:24.600]  Alright, so, I prefaced a lot of this in the last 30 minutes, and I'm just going to talk directly to the people of the planet, to people that serve the establishment, who've done it consciously, who thought they were joining the winning team, who like evil, who like corruption,
[01:31:24.739 --> 01:31:36.500]  who like lies, who like fraud, and then to people that just went along and really didn't think and were told, go to college, get a job, work for a corporation, buy into the corporate culture, do what they say, it's for the children.
[01:31:38.699 --> 01:31:40.039]  Who know this is a lie now.
[01:31:40.439 --> 01:31:47.699]  And then those of you out there that know about the globalists and don't like them, but you don't believe you can do anything, and well, it's just the way it is.
[01:31:47.699 --> 01:31:48.640]  You've been demoralized.
[01:31:48.739 --> 01:31:50.460]  You've had your will partially broken.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:32:02.279]  And then those out there that have been battling tyranny in their own ways, but have done it from a depressed position just because they know it's the right thing to do and because they don't like evil.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:07.300]  And then there's folks who've been fighting tyranny and fighting evil and promoting freedom.
[01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:10.489]  We'll understand what it's really all about.
[01:32:12.789 --> 01:32:24.250]  Seizing the opportunity, seizing the day, carpe diem, and understanding that the journey is the destination, that this is a great honor.
[01:32:24.710 --> 01:32:37.510]  This is an amazing, greatest of all opportunities to face down the most evil trash ever on this planet and to be part of the great awakening and turning the tide.
[01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:44.409]  And look, I know it'd be hard 30 years ago or 40 years ago or 50 years ago to fight the New World Order.
[01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.729]  It was so academic.
[01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:48.250]  It was so esoteric.
[01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:50.609]  It was in the fine print.
[01:32:50.609 --> 01:32:54.590]  It was just beginning to grow and metastasize.
[01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:57.449]  And there was so much freedom and so many opportunities elsewhere.
[01:32:57.449 --> 01:32:59.069]  Why buy into something negative?
[01:32:59.289 --> 01:33:04.689]  Why go confront some windmill, some monster that doesn't really exactly exist?
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:09.079]  According to the corporate media, there's no plan for global government.
[01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:11.100]  There's no plan to take over your body.
[01:33:11.159 --> 01:33:13.020]  There's no plan to inject you with cancer viruses.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:13.960]  That's all crazy.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.140]  Fluoride's good for you.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:19.000]  It doesn't cause infertility and cancer and lower IQ. Of course it does.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.399]  Come on, you don't think the government would do something like that?
[01:33:23.539 --> 01:33:25.500]  That's so diabolical.
[01:33:29.859 --> 01:33:45.739]  So, whoever you are, wherever you're from, whatever your background, If you've not totally turned your back on common sense and the Holy Spirit and your intuition and your sixth sense and your conscience,
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:34:00.619]  why would you go against your own self-interest and go along with a system that wants you poor and alone and then dead?
[01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:03.949]  I mean, that's what the New World Order is.
[01:34:04.069 --> 01:34:12.050]  It's the most predatory, social-darlinistic twist on survival of the fittest in their own words.
[01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:15.829]  I know why a lot of you go along with it.
[01:34:15.909 --> 01:34:16.409]  It's scary.
[01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.090]  You know it's real.
[01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:19.350]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:22.369]  And so you try to make a friend of the devil.
[01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:24.869]  You try to make a bargain with the devil.
[01:34:25.329 --> 01:34:38.750]  Not because you wanted the power of the earth, not because you wanted to rule, but because deep down it sent chills up your spine because you didn't reach out to God and say, this is bigger than me.
[01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:41.090]  I can't do this without you.
[01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:50.289]  Instead, you somehow didn't really realize God was real, but you ran into evil and decided to capitulate to it.
[01:34:51.159 --> 01:34:52.920]  You decided to bow to it.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.359]  You decided by increments to give in to it.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:56.819]  I know.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.520]  I understand.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:13.739]  I came inches from completely being overtaken by the dark side when I was about 16 or 17. But God reached in and snatched me up by the back of my hair and slammed me up against the wall and said,
[01:35:13.739 --> 01:35:14.199]  no.
[01:35:19.609 --> 01:35:21.210]  And the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:35:21.789 --> 01:35:35.189]  I don't think if I hadn't been dipped in some real 200-proof evil, I'd have quite the understanding in my cells now about the enemy.
[01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:43.689]  And just exactly what true Luciferian energy is like.
[01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:48.609]  If you do, I do.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.260]  So, that's what scares the bad guys so much about me.
[01:35:54.479 --> 01:36:02.800]  Because just the aftertaste, just the stuff I couldn't completely wash off because I'm a fallen creature.
[01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:07.260]  Blood of Jesus, the Holy Spirit washed it off my spirit, but there's still a taint.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.239]  Well, that's the taint they worship.
[01:36:09.399 --> 01:36:10.439]  That's the taint they fear.
[01:36:10.619 --> 01:36:12.600]  That's the taint of their God, their little God.
[01:36:14.359 --> 01:36:15.899]  See, I know them better than they do.
[01:36:18.359 --> 01:36:27.430]  So, I am uniquely positioned to tell the servants of the devil that you're on the losing team and you know it.
[01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:41.810]  And to encourage you to get on your knees before the maker of the universe, God Almighty, and to say, I am a sinner.
[01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.430]  I repent for what I've done.
[01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:45.489]  Wash me in the blood of Jesus.
[01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:46.890]  Show me you're real.
[01:36:48.039 --> 01:36:49.020]  I have free will.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.600]  I know you're not like the satanic force that manipulates and tricks and bends free will.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:00.720]  You are the author of free will in my consciousness, and I am so thankful for the gift of consciousness, and I want to spend eternity with you.
[01:37:01.039 --> 01:37:02.880]  I do not want to be cut off from you.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:03.720]  Write this down.
[01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:04.239]  Say this.
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.199]  Say this to God.
[01:37:08.359 --> 01:37:09.859]  Get in your bedroom, your office.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.159]  Turn down the lights.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:11.699]  Sit there.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.399]  Calm.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:13.960]  Breathe deeply.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:16.779]  Maybe for 10 minutes, maybe for an hour.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.500]  Just think and say, now I want to open up the channel.
[01:37:20.399 --> 01:37:24.020]  Now I want God to come through to me.
[01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:26.140]  And you'll feel the resistance.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:28.659]  It's okay to say, I can't do it.
[01:37:28.779 --> 01:37:29.600]  God, break through it.
[01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:37.220]  And like a proton laser, the Holy Spirit will burn through that.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.439]  And you will get hit by the energy.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.760]  And you will fall on your face.
[01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:58.340]  In the incredible awesomeness when you feel the spirit of the absolute creator, master, and commander of all consciousness.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.199]  That's how you join Team Humanity.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.619]  The globalists A hundred years ago said, we're the humanists.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.699]  Oh, we don't believe in God.
[01:38:13.939 --> 01:38:15.119]  Humans are the greatest creature.
[01:38:15.359 --> 01:38:16.239]  We are the God.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.979]  Well, that's what the snake told Adam and Eve in the garden.
[01:38:19.359 --> 01:38:20.779]  Know you not, you are gods.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.960]  I'm going to give you the knowledge of good and evil.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:30.560]  But once they got the humanists in charge, they went, actually, there is that God, and that's a bad God.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.159]  We serve this God, and we're going to be in power, and we're in control.
[01:38:35.979 --> 01:38:38.020]  We're going to build our own universe, our own system.
[01:38:41.710 --> 01:38:44.310]  And lo and behold, they're not atheists, are they?
[01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:46.970]  They're devil worshippers.
[01:38:49.489 --> 01:38:52.710]  None of these atheist leaders are atheists.
[01:38:52.909 --> 01:38:55.010]  They get on their knees to the devil.
[01:38:56.810 --> 01:39:07.989]  They do horrible, evil things to push God's energy further away from them so that they can more directly and intensely merge with their master.
[01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:15.229]  Because that's the energy that they have turned themselves over to.
[01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:27.789]  You were perfect in your mother's womb made by God.
[01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.489]  God knew you before you were conceived.
[01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:42.600]  But then you come out into the fallen world And everything is about pulling you away from God, pulling you away from your natural state, and giving you the knowledge of evil.
[01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.800]  So you can wander out into that spiritual desert.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.819]  You know, I could say, join us politically.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.220]  Obviously, we're the same ones.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.239]  Look at the selfishness and lies of your controllers.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:06.460]  Do you like where you're going?
[01:40:06.699 --> 01:40:07.560]  It's getting dark.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.739]  It smells really bad like death because it is.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:27.220]  But at the end of the day, if you don't realize this is a spiritual battle, and that just means what your eyeballs and your olfactory nerve and your other nerves don't pick up.
[01:40:27.659 --> 01:40:50.539]  Well, if you went and got somebody from a thousand years ago, Say, an alchemist from Greece, somebody that tries to study proto-science, and you came and showed them a cell tower and tried to explain how there's invisible waves that go out that transmit compressed data to this device so you can hear people and do things.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.060]  They would call it magic.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:53.659]  They would say, Zeus put that there.
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.460]  Because they can't...
[01:40:57.899 --> 01:41:05.020]  See the electromagnetic radiation with their eyeballs because your eyeballs don't pick that up.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.060]  But it's there.
[01:41:06.479 --> 01:41:13.340]  To them, they call it a spiritual force or the occult.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:16.960]  All the occult means is the hidden.
[01:41:21.199 --> 01:41:27.630]  Now the genetic engineering, the electron microscopes, The radio telescopes.
[01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:31.409]  The different devices that can read matter.
[01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:35.310]  You go read the quantum mechanics.
[01:41:35.569 --> 01:41:37.050]  You go read the top physicists.
[01:41:37.369 --> 01:41:39.989]  You go and they go, oh yeah, we're made by something.
[01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:42.649]  It's at least five times stronger holding all this together.
[01:41:43.069 --> 01:41:45.810]  And there's no way that this just happened.
[01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:46.750]  And yeah, yeah.
[01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:55.010]  None of them believe the crap about a worm in the ocean that becomes a giraffe.
[01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:01.930]  Now, we do evolve.
[01:42:02.729 --> 01:42:04.409]  We do mutate.
[01:42:05.949 --> 01:42:11.869]  But it doesn't happen the way Darwin said 180 years ago.
[01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:16.670]  And they're artificially mutating us with these mutinogenic injections.
[01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:26.789]  They know to kill the majority of us, but they believe supermen will rise out of the survival of the fittest quagmire.
[01:42:28.289 --> 01:42:30.189]  They're playing God, people.
[01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:34.909]  Did anybody ask you if you accept this?
[01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:39.109]  Anybody ask you if these mad scientists can control your future destiny?
[01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:44.970]  So, here's the deal.
[01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:50.069]  There's a lot more going on in heaven and earth than in all your books, to quote Shakespeare.
[01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:53.949]  Was that Macbeth?
[01:42:54.069 --> 01:42:55.109]  I read it somewhere...
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.359]  I think it says Horatio.
[01:42:57.619 --> 01:43:00.239]  There's a lot more in heaven than earth than is in your books.
[01:43:00.319 --> 01:43:01.340]  Look up who said that.
[01:43:01.539 --> 01:43:02.920]  I know it's Shakespeare, but I want to know which play.
[01:43:03.859 --> 01:43:04.579]  That's true.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:09.840]  There's a lot more in heaven than earth than in all your books.
[01:43:11.859 --> 01:43:19.819]  And so, the bad guys know this, and they're tapped into the evil force, the anti-human force.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.319]  Don't you see that?
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.630]  Don't you want to tap into the Real force?
[01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:30.310]  Not the cancer, not the malfunction, not the lie?
[01:43:32.069 --> 01:43:35.229]  I mean, you know Trudeau and all these politicians and people.
[01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:39.529]  They got all their bodyguards, they're all safe, but they don't want you to have guns.
[01:43:39.689 --> 01:43:40.369]  What monsters?
[01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:42.029]  Of course they want the guns for tyranny.
[01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:43.510]  They're bringing in total tyranny.
[01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:53.609]  It goes together like a hand in glove, like a horse in carriage, like a lock and key, like peanut butter and jelly.
[01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:57.689]  Like cream and coffee.
[01:43:59.029 --> 01:44:01.390]  Like white on rice and flies on shit.
[01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:21.170]  So, the power, not part of the power, not the most powerful thing, the power is in what energy source you decide to resonate with and plug into.
[01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:30.649]  It's all been proven for 60 years that DNA is an electrochemical antenna that transmits and receives.
[01:44:31.989 --> 01:44:33.270]  Everything is energy.
[01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:42.449]  But you have to direct your mind and then your spirit that is connected to that from the higher dimensions to tune to the channel you want.
[01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:45.289]  With your free will.
[01:44:45.569 --> 01:44:49.710]  The Satanists want to trick you to tuning to their channel so that you never know what hits you.
[01:44:49.829 --> 01:44:53.289]  I'm here telling you there's channels you can tune to.
[01:44:53.789 --> 01:44:56.949]  If I want to, I can tune right to the Satan channel.
[01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:58.850]  Directly to the worst channel on it.
[01:44:59.590 --> 01:45:02.590]  That these idiots strive to get to that channel.
[01:45:03.989 --> 01:45:10.229]  You think the devil and his little panopticonic system like lets the average little devil worshipper tune to the worst channel?
[01:45:10.369 --> 01:45:10.510]  No.
[01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:15.590]  Because he wants to deceive them.
[01:45:15.829 --> 01:45:17.350]  He wants to control them.
[01:45:20.850 --> 01:45:31.090]  You tune to the Lucifer channel, you can see the whole damn thing and see what a loser the devil is who'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.
[01:45:36.609 --> 01:45:41.689]  But then the devil will say, I am a servant of God.
[01:45:43.289 --> 01:45:44.369]  I am the tester.
[01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:47.369]  Christ is the morning star.
[01:45:47.569 --> 01:45:48.590]  I am the morning star.
[01:45:50.409 --> 01:45:53.310]  But there's a lot more to that than the satanic interpretation.
[01:45:58.470 --> 01:46:02.229]  Humanity chose to dial into this channel.
[01:46:03.069 --> 01:46:08.989]  Of course, God knew we'd do it, and that's the Satanist top challenge is, well, see, God did this, and the gods are sadists.
[01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:11.430]  No, God wanted to create new sentient beings.
[01:46:12.489 --> 01:46:14.470]  With the capacity to achieve total consciousness.
[01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:17.670]  But he had to give us free will to do it.
[01:46:18.329 --> 01:46:22.010]  And he warns us and he guides us and he sends angels to protect us.
[01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:24.489]  But not if we don't let him in.
[01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:32.789]  And so, I understand that makes total, not just sense, but completion.
[01:46:33.829 --> 01:46:38.989]  And I, little g, made in the image of God, just like you.
[01:46:39.979 --> 01:46:46.060]  Made the decision to have children even though they could turn to the dark side potentially.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.000]  Even though they could serve Satan potentially and end up cut off from God.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.060]  I made the decision.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.020]  I want children.
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.520]  I want to experience that.
[01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:54.699]  I did that.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:12.029]  I created at least the seat with my wife For a new conscious entity to be created by the creator of the universe.
[01:47:13.329 --> 01:47:15.449]  Look at our fantastic power.
[01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:17.710]  Look at what we imagine we later build.
[01:47:18.130 --> 01:47:23.289]  Elon Musk wants a giant, biggest rocket in the world grabbed by a robot arm, and in a year he has it.
[01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:27.810]  That's nothing compared to what we're going to do.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:37.520]  You know, I said I'd get into all these videos and the gun confiscation announcements, and the global is starting to capitulate, and I'll do that coming up.
[01:47:37.739 --> 01:47:40.960]  But this is important, so I'm glad I'm talking about all this right now.
[01:47:41.939 --> 01:47:47.739]  Just join us and do it by opening your heart to God and saying, I want to be good.
[01:47:48.119 --> 01:47:49.140]  Show yourself to me.
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:49.600]  Show me.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.979]  And God will show you.
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.899]  You have no idea that your God is a joke.
[01:47:56.079 --> 01:47:56.899]  He is not a God.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.659]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[01:48:01.079 --> 01:48:09.960]  Man, I am so excited because I know the supplements are amazing and the Patriot Gear, the biggest selection anywhere now, and some of the best designs at the AlexJonesTore.com is amazing.
[01:48:11.039 --> 01:48:16.939]  But I've told our great sponsor we need funds for the legal defense and the fights and the new studios, all this stuff, the Alex Jones Network.
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.680]  We can be shut down as early as next Monday.
[01:48:19.779 --> 01:48:20.260]  They keep trying.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:20.680]  It's a struggle.
[01:48:20.779 --> 01:48:21.560]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:48:22.399 --> 01:48:26.520]  But that's separate from Alex Jones or Infowars, so that's a sponsor and the bad guys can't get it.
[01:48:27.130 --> 01:48:29.210]  But I said, we need collectible silver coins.
[01:48:29.329 --> 01:48:31.569]  We need challenge coins, campaign coins.
[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:33.569]  We need really cool stuff.
[01:48:33.569 --> 01:48:35.210]  And they have come up with some amazing things.
[01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:36.149]  I mean, I designed this.
[01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:37.810]  I forgot I did this months ago.
[01:48:37.930 --> 01:48:38.510]  It finally came in.
[01:48:38.609 --> 01:48:39.489]  Only 2,000 of them.
[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:40.869]  This is going to sell out quick.
[01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:42.189]  It's a collectible coin.
[01:48:43.069 --> 01:48:44.210]  Show some B-roll of it.
[01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:49.430]  It is the 1984 versus 1776 silver limited edition fundraiser coin.
[01:48:50.579 --> 01:48:59.859]  Introducing the 1984 versus 7076 silver limited edition fundraiser coin, a bold statement against tyranny and the celebration of liberty.
[01:49:00.039 --> 01:49:07.119]  This limited edition coin made from one troy ounce of 0.999 fine silver embodies the spirit of resistance.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:21.979]  We're good to go.
[01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:35.770]  A memento, historic signet of your commitment to the fight.
[01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.289]  And it's limited edition.
[01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:43.810]  They put out other limited edition coins that sell for four or five times what they're originally offered for.
[01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:44.970]  There's only 2,000 of these.
[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:47.069]  I predict they're sold out by the end of the weekend.
[01:49:47.609 --> 01:49:48.649]  The AlexJonesTore.com.
[01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:52.130]  I didn't tell them to probably make 5,000, but this is going to go quick.
[01:49:52.590 --> 01:49:53.350]  And also...
[01:49:54.899 --> 01:49:55.960]  Trump on a stump.
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:57.380]  You've heard of Elf on a Shelf.
[01:49:57.479 --> 01:49:59.859]  Well, this is a fully opposable figurine.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:00.619]  It's amazing.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:01.619]  Trump on a stump.
[01:50:01.779 --> 01:50:03.479]  They only made $2,000 of these two.
[01:50:03.699 --> 01:50:05.140]  They should have made $10,000.
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.260]  But it's $19.95 and it supports the transmission.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:12.079]  Get it now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:12.159 --> 01:50:12.800]  Stay with us.
[01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:20.789]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:50:20.850 --> 01:50:21.909]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:23.569]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[01:50:23.649 --> 01:50:24.390]  Thanks for the support.
[01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:25.930]  I love you, Alex.
[01:50:26.069 --> 01:50:28.189]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[01:50:28.449 --> 01:50:28.829]  Thanks, Chris.
[01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:34.010]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:35.210]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:36.149]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.850]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:50:37.069 --> 01:50:39.390]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.869]  It is.
[01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.369]  Yes.
[01:50:40.529 --> 01:50:41.050]  Wow, thank you.
[01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:42.369]  The listeners are amazing.
[01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:48.350]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:52.210]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[01:50:52.390 --> 01:51:03.630]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:04.930]  And I've done well, old Vader.
[01:51:05.939 --> 01:51:08.300]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.119]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[01:51:10.199 --> 01:51:11.979]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Blacks here in a minute.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.720]  I'm starting to mouthwater when you said that.
[01:51:13.819 --> 01:51:14.319]  Oh, I'm starving.
[01:51:14.439 --> 01:51:15.659]  Now, real quick.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.439]  This is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[01:51:18.579 --> 01:51:19.760]  I was talking to you guys before.
[01:51:20.279 --> 01:51:21.680]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:22.520]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[01:51:22.579 --> 01:51:23.520]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[01:51:24.199 --> 01:51:26.739]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[01:51:26.979 --> 01:51:32.699]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.520]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.840]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.939]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.619]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:49.479]  You actually entered during the 10x time period, right?
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.460]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[01:51:52.579 --> 01:51:54.979]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[01:51:55.279 --> 01:51:58.039]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.560]  With a new contest, where are we right now?
[01:51:59.739 --> 01:52:03.000]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[01:52:03.119 --> 01:52:03.600]  It's sick.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.979]  It's all black, jacked up.
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.939]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[01:52:07.199 --> 01:52:08.180]  He picked the wheels.
[01:52:08.319 --> 01:52:09.039]  He picked the tires.
[01:52:09.279 --> 01:52:10.060]  It looks good.
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:10.439]  I don't know.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.560]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[01:52:11.779 --> 01:52:14.479]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[01:52:14.539 --> 01:52:15.479]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[01:52:15.619 --> 01:52:17.180]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[01:52:17.579 --> 01:52:25.779]  He is the winner of all the thousands of folks that came to thealexjonesstore.com and got products to be entered to win or just put your email in for free and you're entered to win.
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:30.220]  He bought two t-shirts, ladies and gentlemen, and he won this incredible super truck.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:31.380]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.039]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:46.069]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here You get to meet Alex.

[01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:51.350]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:52.109]  Enter your email.

[01:52:57.029 --> 01:52:58.090]  You'll be very excited.
[01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:02.670]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[01:53:03.010 --> 01:53:05.649]  Another incredible pickup truck.
[01:53:06.029 --> 01:53:08.529]  Super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:53:08.710 --> 01:53:09.649]  It's a beautiful truck.

[01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:53.130]  Only drove it once.
[01:53:53.489 --> 01:53:54.449]  Things are too nice.
[01:53:54.729 --> 01:53:56.649]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[01:53:57.090 --> 01:53:59.430]  So, we'll see you at thealkshowstore.com, and thanks for all your support.
[01:54:11.329 --> 01:54:22.470]  Joe Biden's pardon of Hunter can only result in the conclusion by the American people that a criminal operation has occupied the highest office in the land for nearly four years.
[01:54:22.649 --> 01:54:29.890]  Hunter Biden, your son, was getting paid a lot of money to serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company facing serious corruption charges.
[01:54:30.090 --> 01:54:31.609]  I don't know what he was doing.
[01:54:31.670 --> 01:54:32.890]  I know he was on the board.
[01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:36.550]  I found out he was on the board after he was on the board, and that was it.
[01:54:36.689 --> 01:54:50.689]  Joe Biden met with Ukrainian, Russian, and Kazakhstani business associates of his sons at a dinner in Washington, D.C. while he was vice president, according to records on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop.
[01:54:50.949 --> 01:54:57.710]  According to NBC News, Joe Biden discussed pardoning Hunter back in June when Hunter was convicted.
[01:54:58.039 --> 01:55:02.560]  However, he told his aides he would lie to the public about his pardon plans.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:11.000]  The pardon covers the time period from when the CIA and the U.S. State Department began their 2014 coup in Ukraine.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:19.020]  And simultaneously, 2014 was the year that the Hunter Biden-funded biolab company Metabiotic.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:24.039]  Began coronavirus research with the Department of Defense in Ukraine.
[01:55:24.239 --> 01:55:36.479]  In June, a spokesman for the Russian military said the US had relocated Ukrainian bio labs to Africa in an attempt to release an avian flu pandemic and blame it on Putin.
[01:55:36.819 --> 01:55:49.520]  Of course, this is where Joe Biden stumbled around and fell asleep at the beginning of the week after pledging a billion dollars to struggling Africans while ignoring the full-blown calamity in North Carolina.
[01:55:49.819 --> 01:55:59.449]  And today, I'm announcing over one billion dollars in new humanitarian support for Africans displaced From homes by historic droughts and food insecurity.
[01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:08.289]  But after the Hunter pardon, it appears that Joe is traveling to pay off his partners in crime and cleaning up his mess.
[01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:12.630]  Of course, the legacy media blew its top over the pardon.
[01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:15.250]  Even CNN is calling it out.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.119]  The Biden Justice Department has been politicized.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:26.439]  That's this message, the message this morning from, no, not just Donald Trump, but from President Joe Biden himself.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:30.760]  Is there any possibility that the president would end up pardoning his son?
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:31.300]  No.
[01:56:31.699 --> 01:56:33.359]  Have you ruled out a pardon for your son?
[01:56:33.659 --> 01:56:34.159]  Yes.
[01:56:34.439 --> 01:56:36.380]  I said I'd abide by the jury decision.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.960]  I will do that, and I will not pardon him.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.279]  Well, it stood until last night.
[01:56:41.439 --> 01:56:52.819]  While Special Counsel David Weiss's office opposed Hunter Biden's motion to dismiss his indictment, on top of that, there's the question of Hunter's ability to utilize the Fifth Amendment.
[01:56:53.029 --> 01:56:55.069]  Now that he has had a blanket pardon.
[01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:59.850]  Did you funnel money to your father from Burisma while he was vice president of the United States?
[01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:00.590]  His answer?
[01:57:00.770 --> 01:57:06.510]  I declined to answer under the rights accorded to me by the Fifth Amendment.
[01:57:06.670 --> 01:57:08.310]  He has no Fifth Amendment rights.
[01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:16.569]  By accepting the pardon, he gave up his Fifth Amendment rights and he would be forced to answer that question no matter who is inculpated.
[01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:19.890]  He still persists in not answering, he'll be incarcerated.
[01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:24.989]  For up to two years, an incarceration that is not pardonable.
[01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:31.350]  Hunter may be pardoned, but now the backs of the big guy and his brother James are up against the wall.
[01:57:31.630 --> 01:57:34.050]  They will need pardons as well.
[01:57:34.289 --> 01:57:44.149]  And Biden's aides, aka handlers, are mulling preemptive pardons for Dr. Fauci, Liz Cheney, and a host of Trump critics in his line of fire.
[01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:48.010]  Of course, it's come out, and Trump's announced, and so has Tom Holman and others.
[01:57:48.609 --> 01:57:58.170]  The new borders are that they are going to criminally go after the human traffickers and smugglers, including the NGOs, the UN, the government officials like Mayorkas and others.
[01:57:58.390 --> 01:58:04.750]  And I've been expecting Biden to try to give them pardons, and my sources have told me exclusively that they are looking for pardons.
[01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:17.180]  Well, now Politico is reporting that Biden is looking at a whole range of pardons for people across federal agencies, but namely Fauci.
[01:58:17.399 --> 01:58:22.819]  There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena.
[01:58:23.039 --> 01:58:24.960]  There will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:58:25.279 --> 01:58:26.899]  There will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:45.180]  And I will put the lie to the individuals We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases,
[01:58:45.359 --> 01:58:48.739]  whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:52.079]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:57.420]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.520]  All right.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.779]  Master criminal.
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:24.060]  Serial liar.
[01:59:24.659 --> 01:59:26.039]  Adam Schiff.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.119]  Officially resigns from Congress.
[01:59:29.279 --> 01:59:29.840]  Effectively.
[01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:33.250]  December 8th.
[01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:36.529]  And the crew, about two minutes ago, said, Adam Schiff's resigning.
[01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.949]  He's resigning.
[01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:39.609]  He's going to jail.
[01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:40.510]  He's going to prison.
[01:59:41.250 --> 01:59:43.670]  I said, no, he's going to print me the statement.
[01:59:43.670 --> 01:59:52.289]  I said, he's going to take the Senate vacancy to position himself in the upcoming election for Dianne Feinstein.
[01:59:54.609 --> 01:59:55.789]  And that's what it is.
[01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:57.130]  And I'm not mad at the crew.
[01:59:57.210 --> 01:59:58.310]  I just instantly knew what it was.
[01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:59.369]  I knew that move was coming.
[02:00:00.210 --> 02:00:01.810]  But that's the least of his problems.
[02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:13.149]  He has committed mass crimes in the fake January 6th commission that was not constitutionally created and that he got caught in a whole bunch of cases falsifying documents and emails.
[02:00:13.329 --> 02:00:14.090]  Serious crime.
[02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:21.770]  He helped pay for and coordinate the Crossfire Hurricane steel dossier with the foreign government.
[02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:24.850]  It's just all over the map.
[02:00:24.949 --> 02:00:27.829]  That's why Biden's talking about pardons for him.
[02:00:29.670 --> 02:00:32.930]  So here is his letter, Adam B. Schiff.
[02:00:33.609 --> 02:00:51.529]  I'm so privileged as a pens dispenser, PES dispenser, with my bug eyes and my watermelon head and my little chicken neck, I'm so privileged to have been chosen by the voters of California to serve as their next United States Senator,
[02:00:52.029 --> 02:00:59.520]  following in the footsteps of the true giant of the Senate, And it just goes on from there.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.659]  As you know, it just goes on.
[02:01:02.859 --> 02:01:03.800]  It's just disgusting.
[02:01:05.319 --> 02:01:08.699]  Alright, so there you have it.
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:14.939]  Now, let me get back to what I was talking about before I had all this other news and take some of your phone calls.
[02:01:20.970 --> 02:01:36.829]  You've got Bezos and Zuckerberg and Senator Fetterman and Bill Maher and just the list goes on and on and on and on.
[02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:41.630]  Psycho Joe Scarborough coming out.
[02:01:41.689 --> 02:01:42.630]  Oh, we like Trump now.
[02:01:42.810 --> 02:01:43.289]  We're friends.
[02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:52.510]  Now, obviously, in almost every case, They're doing that because they want to curry favor with Trump voters.
[02:01:52.710 --> 02:01:55.369]  They want Trump to somehow lower his guard.
[02:01:56.609 --> 02:02:01.229]  They know the public's all turning against him, but still that in and of itself is a big deal.
[02:02:01.569 --> 02:02:08.069]  There's so many other examples of how these people operate, but they're still being paid by the system.
[02:02:08.739 --> 02:02:14.119]  Now you look at Don Lemon, he's out on his ass, his average show is like 200 viewers now, a legend in his own mind.
[02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:22.159]  But he still keeps worshipping the system because they're into it, they like it, they hate America, they hate freedom, they hate team humanity, they hate God.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:28.340]  But it's a great sign that this is happening.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:29.880]  But regardless...
[02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:37.770]  They're gonna have a lot more trouble with their lawfare, their demonization, their attacks, trying to make examples out of people like myself and Trump.
[02:02:38.010 --> 02:02:47.489]  As humanity gets awake and pissed off and understands, lying down to these tyrants is a lot worse for everybody than fighting back.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:51.380]  Again, I don't fight these people because I'm some angel.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.239]  I'm not perfect.
[02:02:52.399 --> 02:02:53.300]  I'm a good person.
[02:02:53.439 --> 02:02:54.319]  I do love justice.
[02:02:54.479 --> 02:02:57.399]  But I do it because they're absolute psychotic tyrants.
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:01.079]  And the alternative of letting them do what they want is just not acceptable.
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.380]  And I always think of the public like I think of myself.
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:06.659]  I think people think like I do.
[02:03:06.699 --> 02:03:08.140]  And a lot of people do think like I do.
[02:03:08.579 --> 02:03:10.119]  But a lot of people don't.
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:15.000]  And I'm just trying to get them to realize that tyranny is a losing proposition.
[02:03:18.710 --> 02:03:31.069]  And so I really want to encourage people in small businesses and school teachers and lawyers and politicians and government agents and military people and everybody.
[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:34.069]  Black people, white people, Hispanics, Asians, old, young.
[02:03:34.489 --> 02:03:40.289]  I mean, join Team Humanity.
[02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:46.409]  I mean, really realize that even if you're overall a good, hardworking person that loves God and everything, great.
[02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:47.930]  Well, there's a lot of tyranny going on.
[02:03:48.289 --> 02:03:53.630]  Don't you feel God's spirit telling you to stand up against it and do something about it?
[02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:55.590]  Doesn't that drive you?
[02:03:58.050 --> 02:04:00.569]  Well, if it doesn't drive you, you got a problem.
[02:04:01.810 --> 02:04:18.930]  So, to the establishment and to the minions of it, and for people that are having second thoughts about working with tyranny, Make the spiritual, cultural decision, the personal decision in your heart to say,
[02:04:19.029 --> 02:04:21.390]  yeah, I choose justice.
[02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:22.130]  I choose God.
[02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:22.810]  I choose freedom.
[02:04:23.010 --> 02:04:25.250]  I choose whatever there is good in the universe.
[02:04:25.329 --> 02:04:26.090]  Maybe you don't even believe in God.
[02:04:26.170 --> 02:04:28.430]  Just say, God, if you're real, show me.
[02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:29.909]  And God will.
[02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:33.770]  If it's heartfelt, if it's real, you will start seeing amazing things happening.
[02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:45.729]  And then, right when you first go, oh my gosh, God's real, You're going to see through the Agent Smiths out there, the people that are turned over to the devil, some conscious, many not.
[02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:49.050]  Agent Smith's going to come at you.
[02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:52.890]  And at that point, you're going to go, wow, this is really amazing.
[02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:55.369]  And say, okay, God, you're real.
[02:04:55.569 --> 02:04:56.430]  I need your help.
[02:04:57.869 --> 02:05:00.409]  And God will never give you something you can't handle.
[02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:02.590]  In my experience.
[02:05:02.909 --> 02:05:04.229]  And I've been extremely blessed.
[02:05:05.079 --> 02:05:06.619]  But I see it everywhere.
[02:05:06.979 --> 02:05:08.579]  And so I'm done talking about that.
[02:05:08.699 --> 02:05:10.060]  I spent most of an hour on it.
[02:05:10.239 --> 02:05:17.300]  We can talk about escalation of World War III and the economy and appointments and the open borders and, you know, all the globalism.
[02:05:17.479 --> 02:05:19.039]  And there's a bunch of new poison shot news.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.399]  I mean, there's a lot of important stuff I'll hit.
[02:05:22.079 --> 02:05:37.340]  But I just wanted to really talk to Senator Fetterman and Bezos and And Zuckerberg and Bill Maher, because, you know, Bill Maher toes the globalist line,
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.020]  but he tries to ride the fence.
[02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:47.539]  And, you know, back when they were censoring me and taking me off the air six, seven years ago, it was a process starting about seven years ago, but it's accelerating.
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:50.659]  He went on air and he said, look, everybody gets free speech.
[02:05:50.779 --> 02:05:52.560]  Everybody gets to say, including Alex Jones.
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:54.079]  Maybe find that clip.
[02:05:54.979 --> 02:05:56.500]  Bill Maher says, Alex Jones gets to speak.
[02:05:57.470 --> 02:06:01.189]  And he understood if we take this guy's speech, we all lose it.
[02:06:01.649 --> 02:06:05.130]  And what they really do when they take your speech is they can then impersonate you.
[02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:06.310]  They can then build a straw man.
[02:06:06.409 --> 02:06:07.029]  They do this.
[02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:11.670]  And I always kind of knew that, but it was like a side issue.
[02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:14.069]  Like, oh, if you get censored, you're not getting heard from.
[02:06:15.029 --> 02:06:16.390]  That's the least of the problem.
[02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:34.850]  When you're famous and well-known and seen as iconic by the system, They then silence you to build up this fake thing that's not you, and that doesn't just hurt you, then they go around in your name doing horrible things to demoralize people.
[02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:46.949]  And now you have Bloomberg and his gun group, anti-gun group, openly saying, yeah, we're going to impersonate him and confuse everybody and do all this stuff, ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:51.689]  And then they illegally power grab this operation and they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:06:51.890 --> 02:06:52.989]  Wait till you hear the new news.
[02:06:53.090 --> 02:06:54.229]  I'm not authorized to tell you yet.
[02:06:54.569 --> 02:06:56.170]  It's devastatingly stunning.
[02:06:57.930 --> 02:06:59.229]  And it's just an adventure.
[02:06:59.409 --> 02:07:00.850]  It's an absolute adventure.
[02:07:01.010 --> 02:07:07.250]  And as long as you trust in God and don't give up, you might lose through the first three quarters, but you win in the end.
[02:07:08.890 --> 02:07:13.430]  And I don't mean just temporarily here on this planet, though that's almost always what happens.
[02:07:14.369 --> 02:07:15.609]  You win spiritually.
[02:07:15.829 --> 02:07:16.909]  You win energetically.
[02:07:17.050 --> 02:07:21.250]  You win in the energy you've chosen.
[02:07:22.850 --> 02:07:27.909]  And your outlook and your energy and what you choose to resonate with is not the number one thing.
[02:07:27.909 --> 02:07:28.390]  It's everything.
[02:07:29.789 --> 02:07:32.189]  So, here's a couple clips of what I'm talking about.
[02:07:32.289 --> 02:07:33.090]  Here's Bill Maher.
[02:07:34.029 --> 02:07:35.789]  He said, hey, we need to give Trump a chance.
[02:07:35.789 --> 02:07:36.989]  We got a really corrupt establishment.
[02:07:36.989 --> 02:07:37.810]  They're out of control.
[02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:39.229]  Let's give him a chance.
[02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:42.079]  You've got Fetterman saying give Trump a chance.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.399]  You've got Fetterman saying give Musk a chance.
[02:07:45.319 --> 02:07:47.039]  You've got Zuckerberg saying it.
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:48.680]  You've got Bezos saying it.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:49.439]  And listen.
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:54.859]  I got approached before all the lawsuits.
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:58.560]  Right when Trump got elected eight years ago.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.939]  By a huge Republican law firm.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.020]  I'm not going to say the biggest.
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:09.819]  I mean, the biggest.
[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:16.260]  And they said, hey, people want to work with you.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:19.159]  We know you're talking to Trump and advising him.
[02:08:20.739 --> 02:08:21.800]  We could help you.
[02:08:21.979 --> 02:08:27.319]  You know, we've got people in our law firm that are, you know, the heads of agencies.
[02:08:28.439 --> 02:08:29.239]  Like, oh, what?
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:30.159]  Oh, well...
[02:08:30.159 --> 02:08:35.880]  Well...
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.539]  Just come meet with us.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:41.840]  And I'm like, CIA? Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:43.699]  This is with telecommunications.
[02:08:45.579 --> 02:08:47.500]  Okay, well, I'm going to be up in D.C. two weeks from now.
[02:08:47.579 --> 02:08:48.420]  Oh, we already heard about that.
[02:08:49.079 --> 02:08:50.600]  So you go to this big, giant boardroom.
[02:08:50.699 --> 02:08:51.920]  It's just like Howard Beale and Network.
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:54.260]  And there's one guy in there.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:56.340]  One of these boardrooms is just like that.
[02:08:56.439 --> 02:08:57.520]  Big, big, dark wood panels.
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:59.659]  30-foot ceiling, 40-foot ceilings.
[02:09:00.739 --> 02:09:01.520]  Green lights.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:03.899]  Guy in a suit standing at the end of the table.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:10.189]  Guys, pull up Howard Beale's Network, voice of God speech.
[02:09:10.569 --> 02:09:15.750]  Howard Beale, you've meddled with the title Forces of Nature, Mr. Beale.
[02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:18.210]  And so that meeting goes on.
[02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:20.989]  And then they just want to fill you out.
[02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:23.829]  There might be some folks want to help you out.
[02:09:23.949 --> 02:09:25.289]  You know, a free speech foundation.
[02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:30.430]  You know, 30, 50 million dollars a year.
[02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:31.529]  You still have your show.
[02:09:32.489 --> 02:09:35.350]  And you work with folks and, you know, you're more successful than ever.
[02:09:35.569 --> 02:09:38.170]  I'm like, well, I've already had this offer from Roger Ailes.
[02:09:38.609 --> 02:09:44.329]  I've already had this offer from the Roth Cop, the Kissinger Group.
[02:09:45.029 --> 02:09:46.590]  I mean, I've had these offers a lot.
[02:09:47.550 --> 02:09:49.670]  I mean, this isn't...
[02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:51.569]  Well...
[02:09:51.569 --> 02:09:55.029]  And then it's like beating around the bush and blah, blah, blah.
[02:09:55.789 --> 02:09:57.350]  So I go, yeah.
[02:09:57.850 --> 02:09:59.189]  And then later...
[02:09:59.189 --> 02:10:01.109]  Well, you're about to get sued a bunch...
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:09.260]  And there's this very rich person, at the time the richest person in the world, who'd really like to help you and believes in free speech.
[02:10:11.479 --> 02:10:18.380]  And is $50 million a year not a good number for your free speech foundation?
[02:10:19.819 --> 02:10:20.760]  Would you like more?
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:26.000]  And I'm like, I'll take $50 million right now and I can do whatever I want with it.
[02:10:26.670 --> 02:10:33.869]  Well, I mean, you know, you got to, with that, with the Free Speech Foundation, you've got to really help people know what's true and what's not.
[02:10:36.829 --> 02:10:40.770]  And then months later, well, you've really made a mistake.
[02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:46.550]  But as you learn about your mistake, we'll still be here if you'd like all this to stop.
[02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:50.170]  And then, in Connecticut...
[02:10:51.279 --> 02:11:06.859]  Three years ago, almost a year before the show trial up there, oh, they want to meet with you in a mediation with this federal judge, and I'm in, again, another 30-story building there in Bridgeport, wherever the naval town is,
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:08.239]  and I'm up there looking over the ocean.
[02:11:09.239 --> 02:11:11.439]  I look at how depressed and destroyed everything is.
[02:11:11.539 --> 02:11:15.729]  There's all the fancy lawyers and The head of the Koskoff law firm comes in.
[02:11:16.810 --> 02:11:19.569]  Josh Koskoff, and he's wearing a stupid little mask and everything.
[02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:22.029]  I'm sitting there with the federal judge.
[02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:28.050]  And I'm sitting there, and he goes, you know, you're not really scared of us, are you?
[02:11:28.989 --> 02:11:30.010]  I'm sitting with Norm Pattis.
[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:30.350]  He's there.
[02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:33.010]  And there's a signing agreement.
[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:37.590]  I won't talk about it, but later they violated it and openly said to my lawyers outside of this, so I can tell a story.
[02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:39.170]  And I don't care if they come after this.
[02:11:39.210 --> 02:11:40.189]  Let's go to court and talk about it.
[02:11:40.670 --> 02:11:43.250]  He says, you know we're like the godfather, right?
[02:11:44.699 --> 02:11:48.000]  And I went, you mean, he goes, yeah, the movie.
[02:11:48.119 --> 02:11:49.779]  I go, you mean the book by Mario Puzo?
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:50.800]  Yeah, it's a great book.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.319]  And he said that, well, you know, we're like that in Connecticut.
[02:11:54.319 --> 02:11:56.100]  We own this place and you will lose.
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:59.159]  And I said, well, I can see you're smiling under your mask.
[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.300]  Why don't you just take it off?
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:03.159]  He's like, oh, no.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.939]  And I'm sitting there right across the table from him, right here, Josh Koskoff.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.000]  He's like six feet across the table.
[02:12:10.130 --> 02:12:15.729]  And I just said, you don't seem to understand that I know what all this is, and I already knew that.
[02:12:15.850 --> 02:12:19.590]  Do you think because you tell me you're the mafia that I'm scared now?
[02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:23.590]  Do you not know that I've been doing this for decades?
[02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:31.550]  I just sat there and was like, okay, yeah, I understand that.
[02:12:34.909 --> 02:12:36.449]  And then he just shoveled off.
[02:12:37.489 --> 02:12:46.350]  And then Norm says, well, he wants to talk without you in the room, and we're driving in the car with Norm, and Norm goes, all right, well, yeah, they want you to do some things, and they're going to drop this.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:49.430]  They want you to stop promoting the Second Amendment and not support Trump.
[02:12:50.670 --> 02:12:54.069]  And I said, let me guess, if I said yes, there's going to be a larger list?
[02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:58.750]  Well, yeah, they'd like to have some conferences with you and some things, and they want you to meet with some people.
[02:12:58.810 --> 02:13:01.170]  And I said, New York or D.C.? He goes, well, he didn't go that far.
[02:13:01.369 --> 02:13:02.689]  I said, tell him burn in hell.
[02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:08.069]  I've already been there, guys, without the lawsuits, without all the attacks.
[02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:09.189]  I've already been promised it all.
[02:13:09.369 --> 02:13:11.050]  Oh, you want this super hot blonde?
[02:13:11.170 --> 02:13:12.329]  You want book deals every year?
[02:13:12.489 --> 02:13:14.489]  You want to have a show every day on Fox?
[02:13:14.670 --> 02:13:15.470]  You want everything?
[02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:16.250]  We're here for you.
[02:13:16.930 --> 02:13:17.909]  No thank you.
[02:13:19.609 --> 02:13:21.729]  Because they want editorial control.
[02:13:22.029 --> 02:13:34.590]  I've been in the towers with all these little people pretending to be the devil and And pretending to try to get me to make a deal with the devil.
[02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:40.069]  And you don't seem to understand.
[02:13:40.529 --> 02:13:42.609]  I've already met the devil.
[02:13:43.869 --> 02:13:46.289]  Made the deal with the real devil.
[02:13:46.890 --> 02:13:49.229]  And God said, no you didn't.
[02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:51.449]  And gank my ass out of there.
[02:13:51.850 --> 02:13:55.010]  I've already dealt with the devil, sonny boy.
[02:13:55.210 --> 02:13:56.390]  And you ain't him.
[02:13:58.909 --> 02:13:59.470]  So...
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.840]  That's where we are.
[02:14:03.619 --> 02:14:07.840]  These people are losers and are jokes.
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:14.699]  And you don't want to be part of their team.
[02:14:16.930 --> 02:14:19.329]  Go ahead and roll the network clip, and then I'll get into the news.
[02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:21.390]  And I was going to take calls.
[02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:23.050]  I don't have time.
[02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.949]  I love your calls.
[02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:26.010]  And I wasn't going to take calls tomorrow.
[02:14:26.170 --> 02:14:33.229]  I was coming up for four hours to take calls from people on COVID shots, and it will be a giant list of murder and death and total medical murder.
[02:14:33.369 --> 02:14:36.529]  And I'm going to do it, but they can shut us down Monday.
[02:14:36.789 --> 02:14:37.390]  Probably not.
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:48.000]  But, there's been behind the scenes stuff, you know, telling security, be ready if he barricades himself in Monday night and all this other crap.
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.140]  No, I got a judge's order to leave here.
[02:14:49.199 --> 02:14:49.659]  We're gone.
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.600]  You're the ones that didn't have judge's orders and got in trouble for it twice.
[02:14:55.199 --> 02:14:56.319]  You're the ones that lied.
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:58.779]  You're the ones that are in deep trouble if there's any justice left in this world.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:14:59.739]  I don't think they own every judge.
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:00.779]  I don't think they own Chris Lopez.
[02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:03.800]  But, they can put a lot of pressure on people.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:15.350]  So, so, I'm just going to cover news for the rest of the transmission.
[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:16.229]  There's too much I need to hit.
[02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:18.909]  But I just wanted to talk about the nature of good and evil.
[02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.390]  And...
[02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:28.369]  There's a lot of you that were at the crossroads and met the devil and didn't know it.
[02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:34.189]  And what I want you to understand is that God is waiting for you.
[02:15:35.909 --> 02:15:36.869]  And it is not...
[02:15:39.869 --> 02:15:42.050]  A bad thing to be persecuted by evil.
[02:15:42.189 --> 02:15:43.909]  It's what Christ said will happen if you're serving him.
[02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:48.270]  And I always knew this, but I thought I was the strong one and I'd fight them.
[02:15:48.409 --> 02:15:50.010]  God was there, but kind of in the back seat.
[02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:55.149]  As I have really stepped into, no, God is the driver.
[02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.789]  Completely.
[02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:05.750]  The persecution, and it's not a masochistic thing, it's the opposite, is joy.
[02:16:07.989 --> 02:16:09.210]  Because I know what it means.
[02:16:09.550 --> 02:16:13.090]  It means I'm having a big effect on these people.
[02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:17.050]  And that just means I'm a vessel, an instrument.
[02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:28.989]  And if I am a sword or a spear that is hacking at the New World Order, that's attacking our children and our spirit, I am...
[02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.729]  Very honored and have prayed.
[02:16:32.069 --> 02:16:33.170]  I don't pray to God for things.
[02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:35.530]  I pray that God will use me however God's defense.
[02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:37.510]  And I am a sword.
[02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:44.250]  You are a sword in the spiritual information war.
[02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:51.049]  And I, if I break or get hacked or broken into pieces, we've already devastated so many enemies.
[02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:52.129]  I've been a good sword.
[02:16:52.909 --> 02:16:57.049]  I am honored to not just be a Viking dying with my sword.
[02:16:57.229 --> 02:16:58.469]  I am a sword.
[02:17:04.550 --> 02:17:07.229]  And I want to be an example to others in the future that fight evil.
[02:17:08.569 --> 02:17:11.309]  This operation, my team, all of us are a sword.
[02:17:11.329 --> 02:17:12.950]  And we are a fabled sword.
[02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:16.190]  We're already a great sword in the lore while we're still alive.
[02:17:19.209 --> 02:17:23.489]  And the greater the battle the sword is in, the greater its lore.
[02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:27.610]  A sword of God.
[02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:29.670]  Not a sword of Satan.
[02:17:29.850 --> 02:17:30.209]  Play the clip.
[02:17:36.229 --> 02:17:43.409]  You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale, and I won't have it!
[02:17:43.729 --> 02:17:44.649]  Is that clear?
[02:17:45.649 --> 02:17:48.250]  Do you think you've merely stopped a business deal?
[02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:49.909]  That is not the case.
[02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:54.290]  The Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and now they must put it back!
[02:17:55.069 --> 02:17:58.129]  It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity.
[02:17:58.430 --> 02:17:59.989]  It is ecological balance.
[02:18:02.049 --> 02:18:07.690]  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
[02:18:08.209 --> 02:18:09.110]  There are no nations.
[02:18:09.329 --> 02:18:10.250]  There are no peoples.
[02:18:10.530 --> 02:18:11.389]  There are no Russians.
[02:18:11.649 --> 02:18:12.510]  There are no Arabs.
[02:18:12.829 --> 02:18:14.030]  There are no Third Worlds.
[02:18:14.149 --> 02:18:15.049]  There is no West.
[02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:20.110]  There is only one holistic system of systems.
[02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:28.350]  One vast and imane interwoven, interacting, multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:37.739]  Petrodollars, electrodollars, multidollars, rank marks, rings, rubles, pounds, and shekels.
[02:18:39.079 --> 02:18:47.200]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[02:18:48.079 --> 02:18:52.579]  That is the natural order of things today.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:19:04.479]  That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today.
[02:19:05.739 --> 02:19:12.020]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature.
[02:19:12.979 --> 02:19:18.360]  And you will atone.
[02:19:19.159 --> 02:19:21.219]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:34.920]  You get up on your little 21-inch screen and howl about America and democracy.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:37.680]  There is no America.
[02:19:38.059 --> 02:19:39.959]  There is no democracy.
[02:19:40.579 --> 02:19:51.500]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
[02:19:51.879 --> 02:19:55.100]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[02:19:56.530 --> 02:19:59.809]  What do you think the Russians talk about in their Council of State, Karl Marx?
[02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:09.930]  They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like that.
[02:20:09.930 --> 02:20:14.170]  All right, and if you watch the whole scene, the intro is important to understand in context in the end.
[02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:19.250]  You can pull up the network clip, title forces of nature, it'll come up.
[02:20:22.450 --> 02:20:26.690]  The issue here is that, okay, so everything's a currency.
[02:20:26.969 --> 02:20:29.389]  So sex trafficking is part of that too in little kids.
[02:20:29.889 --> 02:20:30.809]  We're all a commodity.
[02:20:30.969 --> 02:20:31.729]  We're all disposable.
[02:20:32.010 --> 02:20:33.750]  And then the globalists say there's too many of you.
[02:20:33.809 --> 02:20:34.870]  We don't want you anymore.
[02:20:35.090 --> 02:20:36.750]  See, that's the end of this road.
[02:20:38.350 --> 02:20:44.049]  We have to build a world for humans by humans that empower us, not build a world that makes us obsolete.
[02:20:44.069 --> 02:20:45.030]  And that's what's being done now.
[02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:47.370]  All right, I've done enough on this.
[02:20:47.530 --> 02:20:51.590]  We're going to come back with a bunch of news, and I'll play the capitulation clips, too.
[02:20:52.290 --> 02:20:52.850]  Stay with us.
[02:20:52.989 --> 02:21:04.489]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at Infowars, and our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in just a while.
[02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:05.530]  A few weeks.
[02:21:05.649 --> 02:21:10.510]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:21:10.649 --> 02:21:11.549]  Talk about fun.
[02:21:11.729 --> 02:21:13.850]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[02:21:13.989 --> 02:21:18.850]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street or at work at their Christmas party.
[02:21:19.069 --> 02:21:23.909]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[02:21:24.129 --> 02:21:27.530]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:29.750]  Trump one, I'm afraid.
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:35.200]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs at theologshownstore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[02:21:35.319 --> 02:21:37.180]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:40.540]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[02:21:40.579 --> 02:21:41.959]  Can you hear us now?
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:45.239]  And theologshownstore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.420]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[02:21:47.579 --> 02:21:50.979]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:56.040]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:58.739]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[02:21:58.940 --> 02:22:00.219]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:06.899]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?
[02:22:07.479 --> 02:22:08.579]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.100]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:13.979]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.739]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.940]  If you're blown away by these designs, it's just a few of them.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:21.100]  There's over 200 designs right now at theauctionstore.com.
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:23.020]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[02:22:23.219 --> 02:22:24.059]  God bless you all.
[02:22:24.059 --> 02:22:24.979]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:28.459]  Ho ho ho!
[02:22:28.819 --> 02:22:30.200]  Merry Christmas!
[02:22:53.069 --> 02:22:56.530]  Alright, so I talked a lot about this, but let me actually get to the clips and I'll move into other news.
[02:22:56.770 --> 02:22:58.590]  Just some of the capitulations going on.
[02:22:59.590 --> 02:23:04.809]  Jeff Bezos says mainstream media must appeal to Donald Trump and be nice to him.
[02:23:06.610 --> 02:23:11.409]  He goes on to say, Bezos says he's very optimistic about Trump's plan to roll back regulations.
[02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:16.590]  Jeff Bezos says he will try to talk Trump out of the idea that the news media is the enemy.
[02:23:17.329 --> 02:23:22.489]  After Bezos went so hard against Trump behind the scenes but publicly acted like he was neutral.
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.120]  Same thing with Fetterman.
[02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:26.420]  We'll play that clip as well.
[02:23:26.579 --> 02:23:30.319]  But the first one I want to get to, because you can't make a big enough deal about this, is Bill Maher.
[02:23:30.399 --> 02:23:31.520]  Bill Maher is extremely smart.
[02:23:33.579 --> 02:23:35.079]  And he plays both sides.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:49.299]  But the fact that he's moved so close to Trump and is trying to sell his audience on Trump shows that he knows that, just as a survivor, that it's totally unpopular.
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:24:00.719]  But more importantly, that the horrible people managing things right now into World War III and total collapse, and that absolutely hate the country, are going to wreck it, and he'll have no future.
[02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:04.659]  So Bill Maher has some self-preservation instinct.
[02:24:04.879 --> 02:24:07.340]  He'll go sell out for 30 years to the left.
[02:24:08.059 --> 02:24:09.420]  He'll play along with them.
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:09.920]  And I get it.
[02:24:09.979 --> 02:24:14.579]  Back then, the Republicans were just as bad as the left, as blue-blood globalists, warmongers.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.879]  But now, with Ron Paul, and then Trump, and the Tea Party, and what we're doing...
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:24.340]  The Republicans are like 80% taken over by patriots now.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:28.840]  I mean, we're really, you know, got a huge beyond the beach yet.
[02:24:30.639 --> 02:24:32.379]  So we've reformed one party.
[02:24:32.579 --> 02:24:34.040]  I don't think you can reform the Democrats.
[02:24:34.379 --> 02:24:37.040]  We need a two-party system, so...
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:39.340]  Is the Republican Party splitting two?
[02:24:41.159 --> 02:24:42.600]  Yeah, now Drudge is reporting.
[02:24:44.879 --> 02:24:47.899]  As I told you days ago, he's not going to stop.
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:25:04.700]  First it's, oh, you know, Senator Schiff and Congresswoman Cheney and, oh, now it's going to be Mayorkas and everybody else.
[02:25:05.399 --> 02:25:06.639]  Because they have to.
[02:25:09.059 --> 02:25:09.620]  Fauci.
[02:25:09.879 --> 02:25:10.040]  Fauci.
[02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:26.329]  Jeff Bezos says mainstream media must appeal to Trump, yet try to fool him like eight years ago into thinking they're really, you know, the neocons and others are on his side while they stab him in the back.
[02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:28.829]  That's not going to happen with Trump now.
[02:25:29.209 --> 02:25:39.090]  He went and campaigned for Mitt Romney to win the Senate, and then Romney turned around for pledging he'd support him and stabbed him in the back because they're scum of the earth.
[02:25:40.370 --> 02:25:41.209]  And here it is.
[02:25:41.290 --> 02:25:45.950]  Biden weighs preemptive pardons for political targets of Trump retribution NBC News.
[02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:48.530]  They're getting everybody ready for it.
[02:25:49.170 --> 02:25:54.969]  President Joe Biden and his senior aides are discussing the idea of issuing preemptive pardons.
[02:25:55.770 --> 02:25:56.850]  This just came out.
[02:25:58.870 --> 02:26:02.090]  For people, President-elect Trump has scorned.
[02:26:02.209 --> 02:26:06.930]  Oh, so it's a pardon for he might come after him, which is admitting they're guilty.
[02:26:07.489 --> 02:26:08.850]  So it's preemptive pardon.
[02:26:08.889 --> 02:26:09.590]  That's never happened before.
[02:26:09.969 --> 02:26:20.850]  In recent years, as he has hinted about his plans for retribution, two sources familiar with the disastrous activities, I added that, a Biden confirmed.
[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:34.170]  And by disastrous, I told Trump, and I told his people, and I told His task force leaders, I said, you must go ahead and say you're coming after them.
[02:26:34.850 --> 02:26:44.690]  They'll go on the total defense, and they'll start pardoning them left and right, which will totally convict them even further in the public eye, and then we can destroy them at the state level, and it won't be fake charges like with Trump.
[02:26:46.809 --> 02:26:51.549]  I mean, this is basic right thing to do, and funny, right thing to do is always the best strategy.
[02:26:51.549 --> 02:26:58.590]  Evil people convince themselves that it's not the thing to do.
[02:27:01.459 --> 02:27:14.739]  While the discussions have included certain names, including Senator-elect Adam Schiff, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the process hasn't progressed to the point of consensus on an actual list.
[02:27:15.739 --> 02:27:23.319]  Some Democrats and never-Trump Republicans have supported the notion of preemptive pardons to protect people under a new Trump presidency.
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:26.459]  Politico first reported that Biden was considering taking action.
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.920]  Now, NBC News has confirmed they're actually down to the list right now.
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:33.940]  Previous presidents have issued such pardons.
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:35.079]  No, they haven't.
[02:27:35.079 --> 02:27:38.780]  Including George H.W. Bush to former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger.
[02:27:38.879 --> 02:27:45.620]  Well, that was specifically because they'd already started filing the war crime charges over the role in the Iran-Contra scandal.
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:49.420]  Gerald Ford and former President Nixon in the wakes of Watergate scandal.
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.260]  Well, they were already being charged.
[02:27:51.799 --> 02:27:53.879]  Jimmy Carter for Vietnam War draft dodgers.
[02:27:55.559 --> 02:27:57.479]  Well, that's because they'd already committed a crime.
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:59.479]  And Abraham Lincoln for ex-Confederate soldiers.
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:03.840]  Well, no, that was because they'd already been in the war, and he said, leave them alone.
[02:28:03.959 --> 02:28:04.959]  That's not true.
[02:28:05.819 --> 02:28:12.319]  During the 2024 campaign, Trump made threatening comments about people who had felt slighted or wronged him.
[02:28:12.559 --> 02:28:12.799]  Felt?
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:16.100]  How about they committed huge crimes against America?
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.840]  How about they engaged in political persecution?
[02:28:21.399 --> 02:28:22.819]  All right, here is...
[02:28:30.319 --> 02:28:33.520]  Now, they are calling themselves the disruptors.
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:41.379]  It sounds like one of those cartoons, like the ex-presidents that they used to have on SNL. The disruptors, you know, this crew of people.
[02:28:41.559 --> 02:28:45.000]  So let me ask if we just agree on these two basic premises that I look at.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:48.399]  One, the country does need disrupting.
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:51.979]  I mean, the country needs a colonic and a slap in the face so bad.
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:54.579]  This...
[02:28:59.459 --> 02:29:02.420]  This is not who I would choose to administer the colonic.
[02:29:03.899 --> 02:29:06.440]  But it's not like the bureaucracy isn't bloated.
[02:29:06.639 --> 02:29:09.020]  It's not like the debt isn't $36 trillion.
[02:29:09.579 --> 02:29:17.600]  It's not like there aren't thousands of regulations that do stop people from living lives that they could live better and don't do anything.
[02:29:19.239 --> 02:29:21.079]  There is woke in the military.
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:24.340]  Whatever they're going after, I'm not saying there isn't a...
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:26.379]  And I'm not going to pre-hate anything.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:30.680]  Do I have really good optimistic feelings about it?
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:31.559]  No, I don't.
[02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:34.290]  But I'm just not going to pre-hate.
[02:29:34.409 --> 02:29:35.870]  I can't get into that mind.
[02:29:36.069 --> 02:29:38.270]  Let's see what the disruptors can do.
[02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:46.510]  Because, quite frankly, the experts have just sort of, like, let something go for so long that it's just sclerotic now and constipated.
[02:29:46.829 --> 02:29:53.170]  Well, Mencken said democracy is a theory that the people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.
[02:29:53.889 --> 02:29:54.329]  And...
[02:29:54.329 --> 02:29:55.629]  Who said that?
[02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:56.209]  Mencken.
[02:29:56.489 --> 02:29:56.909]  Mencken.
[02:29:57.149 --> 02:29:58.049]  Or they said Lincoln.
[02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:03.370]  You see yourself ultimately working with folks like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy who will be heading...
[02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:08.889]  Yeah, again, I admire Mr. Musk.
[02:30:09.549 --> 02:30:13.229]  He's been involved in very important parts of American society.
[02:30:13.469 --> 02:30:17.870]  AI, SpaceX, and other kinds of things.
[02:30:18.049 --> 02:30:23.030]  Yes, he's on a different team, but that doesn't make me an enemy.
[02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:26.129]  I don't be automatically going to become a critic.
[02:30:26.909 --> 02:30:37.090]  It's like, hey, he's made our economy and our nation better, and our politics are different, and I don't agree with some of the things that he might say.
[02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:39.549]  But that doesn't make him, like I said, an enemy.
[02:30:42.229 --> 02:30:45.530]  So, Zuckerberg, all of them, that's what's happening, because they're smart.
[02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:46.930]  Doesn't mean you can trust them.
[02:30:47.569 --> 02:30:52.250]  Meanwhile, Obama suddenly concerned about election rigging and weaponizing justice.
[02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:57.700]  This is the most perfect inversion or total projection ever.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:11.360]  I mean, I remember Lois Lerner 12, 13 years ago, they were auditing hundreds of thousands of conservatives, tens of thousands of conservative and Christian non-profits, harassing them, indicting them.
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:14.799]  And I never forget MSNBC hosts going, well, of course we're doing this.
[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:15.500]  They're Republicans.
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:16.260]  They're the enemy.
[02:31:16.959 --> 02:31:19.579]  So they admit they're going out to innocent people.
[02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:22.020]  Leticia James, all of them run...
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.760]  Her office in New York and places saying, I'm going to get Trump.
[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:27.579]  I'll find something.
[02:31:27.899 --> 02:31:29.260]  I'll put his ass in jail.
[02:31:29.459 --> 02:31:30.479]  His white ass.
[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:32.319]  She had some racist crap to it.
[02:31:32.379 --> 02:31:32.700]  Like, what?
[02:31:32.819 --> 02:31:33.319]  What is this?
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:38.059]  And we have so many examples of this that'll make your head spin.
[02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:38.860]  I know it makes mine.
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:41.459]  I don't even begin to list them.
[02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:44.440]  I mean, if you think about it, it's like it'll make your head explode.
[02:31:45.219 --> 02:31:47.940]  And then he says, this is what Trump's going to do.
[02:31:49.010 --> 02:31:50.809]  Well, you guys committed the crimes.
[02:31:50.809 --> 02:31:51.809]  You started the fight.
[02:31:52.149 --> 02:31:54.569]  You're still going to come after us if we don't go after you.
[02:31:56.590 --> 02:32:06.870]  And we've got real stuff you did, like human smuggling and women and children and sex slavery and World War III and all the bid rigging and insider trading and Jeffrey Epstein and the P. Diddy crap.
[02:32:06.969 --> 02:32:08.930]  It just goes on and on and on.
[02:32:09.329 --> 02:32:13.670]  So, we can't not come after you.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.739]  And the public will differentiate that you did real stuff.
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:27.620]  So whereas it made people love Trump for his mugshot, people are going to hate you for yours because it's real crimes you've committed.
[02:32:28.399 --> 02:32:41.680]  And if Trump doesn't go balls to the walls against these people, and if the state attorney generals don't do it, like Kim Paxton, which he's doing, you're not doing your duty, you're aiding and abetting evil, and they're going to get us.
[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:44.260]  Remember, we gotta get them.
[02:32:44.379 --> 02:32:45.659]  We gotta put the Republicans in prison.
[02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:46.440]  They'll put us in prison.
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:47.959]  That wasn't gonna happen.
[02:32:48.719 --> 02:32:50.399]  That's never been a Republican thing.
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:53.260]  That's what the crazies do.
[02:32:54.180 --> 02:32:55.719]  But you did it.
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:57.500]  You keep attacking.
[02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:01.659]  I mean, they've gotten up in court.
[02:33:02.719 --> 02:33:09.579]  In Texas, both the Connecticut lawyers and the Texas lawyers that are all working for the Democrats, same one suing Elon Musk, Trump, everybody else, same law firms, look it up.
[02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:13.459]  And said, we've spent $326 million.
[02:33:13.659 --> 02:33:14.920]  I keep saying $316.
[02:33:15.059 --> 02:33:18.760]  It's $326 million, they said last Monday, trying to shut me down.
[02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:20.340]  Wow.
[02:33:22.559 --> 02:33:24.500]  And they filed that in court.
[02:33:24.719 --> 02:33:25.739]  I'm sure it's way exaggerated.
[02:33:25.899 --> 02:33:27.100]  It's still a lot of money, whatever it really is.
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:28.360]  It's 10% of that.
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:32.299]  And I have no idea what they really spent.
[02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:47.629]  But all these law firms have these charity accounts, and they're supposed to, they write it off on taxes, spend 30% of their time when they write it off on charity.
[02:33:47.809 --> 02:33:53.149]  So in the filings, they're maxing out their charity time, but then asking for money.
[02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:57.129]  So their charity's terrorizing journalists, terrorizing popular pundits.
[02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:01.329]  I wear all those hats when you do journalism, analysis, punditry, humor.
[02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:03.010]  You know, I do it all.
[02:34:03.969 --> 02:34:10.329]  And They've been waging war on me because I'm popular, not because I did mean things.
[02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:15.829]  And they want to intimidate everybody, and they've said that in the courts and on the court, I'll step in their filings.
[02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:23.770]  They've said, well, we've just asked Mr. Jones to stop what he's doing, and he won't do it.
[02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:26.489]  Well, what is that, the judge says?
[02:34:26.610 --> 02:34:27.809]  Well, harassing these families.
[02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:29.670]  What, when they attack me constantly, I defend myself?
[02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:40.209]  These families, they're tiger's paw, they're Their glove, their mask, that Bloomberg runs it all.
[02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:43.309]  And...
[02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:50.170]  But they admit, they've come to me with a list of demands.
[02:34:52.530 --> 02:34:56.409]  Yeah, yes, the same law firm suing Elon Musk, also suing Alex Jones.
[02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:57.049]  Yep.
[02:35:00.809 --> 02:35:01.250]  So...
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:06.120]  I mean, it's an honor.
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:13.899]  Can you imagine if I said, yes, I will meet with you, and this big list of things politically you want, I will do it.
[02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:18.520]  And then it'll be, okay, well, now we want you to go do this and do that.
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:24.920]  Can you imagine if I went and became a creature of Michael Bloomberg?
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:32.000]  I mean, there's not even a thought in my mind of even considering that.
[02:35:33.319 --> 02:35:35.260]  A coward dies a thousand deaths.
[02:35:35.819 --> 02:35:38.020]  They could put a gun to my head.
[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:42.780]  Or my children's head.
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:45.420]  And I'd say no.
[02:35:45.639 --> 02:35:46.540]  And you know why?
[02:35:46.719 --> 02:35:52.520]  Because the attitude of selling out to bullies and intimidation is the attitude that gets everybody enslaved or killed.
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:58.440]  Zapata and many others have said it, but he gets the credit.
[02:35:58.739 --> 02:35:59.799]  It's one of the more modern statements.
[02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:05.110]  Said, I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees as a slave.
[02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:06.489]  And I've said this many times.
[02:36:06.649 --> 02:36:07.370]  It's an Alex Jones quote.
[02:36:08.729 --> 02:36:11.430]  You don't die on your feet.
[02:36:11.989 --> 02:36:14.250]  You die on your knees inside.
[02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:19.469]  And historically, when you live on your knees, you die physically a lot more often as well.
[02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:22.530]  The best place to be is on your feet.
[02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:27.049]  And I am on my feet.
[02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:31.049]  Fighting.
[02:36:35.690 --> 02:36:38.110]  Because that's what feels good.
[02:36:39.170 --> 02:36:43.229]  And it's the right thing intellectually, morally, spiritually.
[02:36:43.229 --> 02:36:44.870]  The feeling is spiritual.
[02:36:45.229 --> 02:36:47.610]  It's the high I get.
[02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:51.149]  Vaporizing corruption.
[02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:53.590]  Bringing down tyrants.
[02:36:54.229 --> 02:37:01.409]  And the joy of the battle as they see in my eyes and feel in my spirit.
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:03.959]  That I love it.
[02:37:04.479 --> 02:37:06.059]  That really freaks them out.
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:11.500]  Because they're the cowards, they're the scum, they're the trash, they're the filth that's sold out to evil.
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:14.819]  They're the ones that have to look themselves in the mirror and have that cold chill.
[02:37:15.079 --> 02:37:17.200]  They're the ones that have been cut off from God.
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:22.680]  They're the ones that have to live with the devil they've chosen as their master.
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:24.159]  Not me.
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:26.559]  I'm not part of those timid souls.
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:28.180]  I'm the man in the arena.
[02:37:28.659 --> 02:37:34.760]  And whether I'm successful in my fight or not, I'll never be with those timid souls who know not.
[02:37:37.459 --> 02:37:44.340]  The incredible exhilaration of victory or even in failure are never with those timid souls.
[02:37:44.459 --> 02:37:45.420]  Here, let me read you the quote.
[02:37:48.159 --> 02:37:50.739]  Teddy Roosevelt, part of the speech, I read the whole thing.
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:52.120]  In Paris, France.
[02:37:54.110 --> 02:38:08.290]  In April 23rd, 1910, 114 years ago, it is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:17.489]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs.
[02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:33.610]  Who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause,
[02:38:33.889 --> 02:38:52.000]  who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls, Who neither know victory nor defeat.
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:39:03.579]  So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:13.399]  In the arena, exercising my free will, exercising my will.
[02:39:15.059 --> 02:39:17.860]  They don't want you exercising your will.
[02:39:19.569 --> 02:39:20.770]  Which is your soul.
[02:39:21.049 --> 02:39:22.270]  Which is everything.
[02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:29.129]  You think you got people with problems not exercising and I've been in that position not doing it enough.
[02:39:30.090 --> 02:39:30.829]  Now I do.
[02:39:36.649 --> 02:39:41.760]  And I sat back six months ago and I said you know I don't think enough of myself.
[02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:49.700]  I'm just so committed to this that I don't go to the parties, the events, don't care about power, prestige, or any of it.
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:59.139]  Refuse constantly, you know, go here, do this, be with us here, do that thing here, wear tuxedos here, come to this, come to Mar-a-Lago, come to this Hollywood person, come out to dinner with us.
[02:39:59.219 --> 02:40:00.979]  I'm just like, nah, it means nothing.
[02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:11.370]  But sitting there and not taking care of myself because I had so put myself in a position of being so disconnected from everything, I realized my enemies don't want me to be healthy.
[02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:12.909]  My enemies don't want me to be good-looking.
[02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:14.629]  My enemies don't want me to be energetic and happy.
[02:40:14.729 --> 02:40:16.270]  I'm like, oh, they want me depressed.
[02:40:16.450 --> 02:40:17.690]  I'm going to be happy.
[02:40:17.889 --> 02:40:19.250]  I'm going to be healthy.
[02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:20.489]  I'm going to work harder.
[02:40:20.569 --> 02:40:23.750]  I'm going to be more successful because that's all they want is to hurt me.
[02:40:24.170 --> 02:40:33.530]  And the best revenge, as the French say, is living well and not being Like your enemies.
[02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:36.729]  And so, here we are.
[02:40:37.569 --> 02:40:40.270]  Because I'm stronger in the middle of the fight.
[02:40:40.450 --> 02:40:41.010]  Not weaker.
[02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:42.950]  And you should be too.
[02:40:43.069 --> 02:40:44.149]  And I know most of you are.
[02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:50.930]  And then we look at a pathetic creature who already has had his third term unelected.
[02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:53.309]  Barack Obama.
[02:40:54.209 --> 02:40:57.930]  Up there with his fake good old boy accent.
[02:40:59.719 --> 02:41:17.979]  Telling us that Trump is the tyrant and that we're the bad people and that we're the liars and everything he says is an indictment of his pathetic self with all the Hollywood scum turning on him and his whole little house of cards coming down around him.
[02:41:19.479 --> 02:41:20.620]  He's a devil.
[02:41:21.239 --> 02:41:22.399]  He's a loser.
[02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:24.559]  And he knows it.
[02:41:25.819 --> 02:41:26.799]  Here's a clip.
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:44.760]  There are going to be times, potentially, when one side tries to stack the deck and lock in a permanent grip on power.
[02:41:45.559 --> 02:41:55.420]  Either by actively suppressing votes, or politicizing the armed forces, or using the judiciary, the criminal justice system to go after opponents.
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:03.920]  And in those circumstances, pluralism does not call for us to just stand back and say, well, I'm not sure.
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:05.780]  That's okay.
[02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:14.520]  In those circumstances, a line has been crossed, and we have to stand firm.
[02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:18.040]  Man, I could do a whole show just on that.
[02:42:19.659 --> 02:42:23.040]  They're the ones politicizing the military using it as a brainwashing laboratory.
[02:42:23.459 --> 02:42:25.559]  They're the ones using weaponized courts.
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:32.040]  They're the ones that were trying to get a permanent grip on power, and we still haven't defeated them yet, but we are wrestling that away.
[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:36.979]  I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[02:42:37.899 --> 02:42:41.200]  Now, I've got some more news I'm going to hit, and then Jay Dyer's coming up in a while since he's been on.
[02:42:41.239 --> 02:42:43.139]  He always does a great job getting into the globalist on documents.
[02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:46.120]  You don't want to miss it in the war room 3 p.m.
[02:42:46.219 --> 02:42:46.319]  today.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:51.159]  But just remember, we could be shut down Monday.
[02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:57.610]  The judge said the sale of the onion didn't happen last Monday, two weeks ago, a week and a half ago.
[02:42:58.129 --> 02:43:01.649]  He said that back on the 14th emergency hearing the day after the fake sale.
[02:43:03.069 --> 02:43:04.770]  And they still keep saying it is.
[02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:07.989]  And the U.S. trustees called up, you know, tell security we'll get ready.
[02:43:08.229 --> 02:43:09.430]  The judge says we have it.
[02:43:09.530 --> 02:43:11.389]  We're throwing them out Monday evening.
[02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:13.809]  I'll be in Houston at the court.
[02:43:14.610 --> 02:43:18.850]  And I don't think that's going to happen because what they did is just unbelievable fraud, in my view.
[02:43:18.930 --> 02:43:21.309]  And we filed that in the court with the evidence with the U.S. code.
[02:43:22.799 --> 02:43:24.540]  Which my lawyers have never done to a U.S. trustee.
[02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:25.459]  They say it's open and shut.
[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:26.239]  They can't believe it.
[02:43:26.479 --> 02:43:28.719]  And he was in deposition yesterday, and it was even more insane.
[02:43:28.799 --> 02:43:30.079]  And I'm not going to release this yet.
[02:43:30.219 --> 02:43:31.159]  It's bad.
[02:43:32.219 --> 02:43:34.079]  I'll do it this afternoon, I'm pretty sure.
[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:38.959]  But the point is, whatever happens to us, you are this operation.
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.899]  And we'll just be over at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:44.639]  We've got a bigger studio, almost down at the little studio.
[02:43:46.250 --> 02:43:55.370]  And at AJNLive on X, and we haven't really turned it into a big news site yet, but AlexJones.network and RealAlexJones, and those are the URLs to remember.
[02:43:56.409 --> 02:43:59.229]  Elon Musk has come in to block them getting RealAlexJones, the rest of it.
[02:44:00.129 --> 02:44:04.610]  And this will blow up in their face, and they'll persecute me and harass my family and all that.
[02:44:04.649 --> 02:44:07.270]  It just pisses my family off and makes them fight harder.
[02:44:07.729 --> 02:44:09.989]  So whatever, you want to make sure I just fight harder?
[02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:11.970]  Great.
[02:44:11.970 --> 02:44:13.409]  So you want to fight?
[02:44:13.569 --> 02:44:14.670]  You came to the right person.
[02:44:14.850 --> 02:44:15.930]  You came to the right place.
[02:44:16.090 --> 02:44:18.329]  I mean, I like to fight bad people.
[02:44:19.329 --> 02:44:22.329]  And so you make me get up in the morning, a little spring of my step.
[02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:24.590]  But I don't do it for you.
[02:44:24.729 --> 02:44:27.110]  I don't fight evil and hate evil.
[02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:31.430]  That's not why I do hate evil, but I don't do it for that reason.
[02:44:31.430 --> 02:44:34.709]  I fight for my family and my children and the world that they live in with your children.
[02:44:35.090 --> 02:44:36.270]  So I do it for those I love.
[02:44:37.209 --> 02:44:40.549]  But it does add a little nitrous oxide to the fuel mix.
[02:44:41.629 --> 02:44:44.329]  You know, a few thousand more horsepower to the engine.
[02:44:45.489 --> 02:44:47.569]  So, there you go.
[02:44:48.729 --> 02:44:53.809]  It's like, I'm going to look for a fight, don't want to get in a fight, but once one starts, I'm like, man, this feels really good.
[02:44:54.350 --> 02:44:57.430]  And it's just like a physical fight, but even more intense.
[02:44:57.670 --> 02:45:05.750]  And anybody that's been in a few fights, even little guys, people that don't look for trouble, almost everybody starts getting in a fight, somebody's trying to hurt you.
[02:45:05.829 --> 02:45:08.209]  Man, you're like, wow, this feels good.
[02:45:10.419 --> 02:45:20.079]  Because being who you really are and you're performing to your highest levels physically, you're forcing your will against people that are attacking you.
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:22.879]  Well, this fight is for everything.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:24.479]  And so I'm honored to be here.
[02:45:24.659 --> 02:45:31.879]  Please remember that the OwlShieldStore.com has incredible supplements that are game changers like Ultimate CMOS, the Ultimate Superfood.
[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:35.000]  There's the biggest discounts ever on the store right now.
[02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:37.260]  The Black Friday Cyber Week sales are additional.
[02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:40.450]  30-40% off on top of sales.
[02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:45.610]  VIP members get $40 a month to spend for $30 a month being a member, and you can cancel any time.
[02:45:46.049 --> 02:45:50.250]  And VIP members are also getting a bunch of free gifts this week between $30 and $50 of value.
[02:45:50.489 --> 02:45:52.389]  There's also the amazing Alex Jones.
[02:45:52.709 --> 02:45:56.129]  I mean, I don't normally wear stuff with me on it, but I'm going to wear that, the Christmas sweater.
[02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:58.129]  But this is what you need to know.
[02:45:58.610 --> 02:46:01.250]  They made 2,000 of these coins.
[02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:04.180]  It will sell out very quickly.
[02:46:04.979 --> 02:46:13.559]  And they are the 1984 versus 1776 coin, 0.999 silver collector's item.
[02:46:13.559 --> 02:46:14.959]  That is a fundraiser item.
[02:46:15.159 --> 02:46:22.840]  And there is Trump on a stump like Elf on a Shelf, opposable doll, opposable figurine.
[02:46:23.079 --> 02:46:25.739]  Great for the kids, great stocking stuffers, great conversation pieces.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:27.799]  And I can skin them alive.
[02:46:27.799 --> 02:46:28.700]  I love these guys.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:30.840]  I didn't even come up with this great idea, but they only made $2,000.
[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:35.100]  And I said at the start of the show, oh my gosh, this would have solved all our problems.
[02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:35.979]  Why didn't I think of this?
[02:46:36.159 --> 02:46:37.799]  They only made $2,000.
[02:46:39.059 --> 02:46:45.360]  I bet we could sell $50,000 of these for $19.95, and that would fund us no problem for months and months and months.
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:48.920]  But, as usual, the perfect idea, but not enough of it.
[02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:51.840]  But for those of you that get it, I predict they'll be sold today.
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:55.440]  The $2,000 will be sold out at current sales rates in about two hours.
[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:01.350]  But it's okay.
[02:47:01.489 --> 02:47:04.190]  We got plenty of the CMOS and a lot of great t-shirts and the new...
[02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:05.989]  Oh my gosh, I want to show you the B-roll.
[02:47:06.069 --> 02:47:06.430]  Do we have it?
[02:47:06.889 --> 02:47:08.069]  Of the...
[02:47:08.069 --> 02:47:09.790]  Oh, wait till you see these t-shirts.
[02:47:09.889 --> 02:47:10.309]  We'll be right back.
[02:47:10.549 --> 02:47:11.950]  This is a vital transmission.
[02:47:12.010 --> 02:47:14.069]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:18.049]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[02:47:18.610 --> 02:47:18.930]  So...
[02:47:20.079 --> 02:47:20.920]  We need to stay on air.
[02:47:21.079 --> 02:47:22.520]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[02:47:22.659 --> 02:47:26.500]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:31.520]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:35.500]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:37.100]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[02:47:38.709 --> 02:47:44.969]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[02:47:45.270 --> 02:47:46.870]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:50.329]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[02:47:51.329 --> 02:47:53.229]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[02:47:53.469 --> 02:47:55.370]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[02:47:56.209 --> 02:48:02.280]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:09.219]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it if that continues.
[02:48:09.399 --> 02:48:10.239]  Look at this bad boy.
[02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:13.079]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:13.879]  I designed it.
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:20.299]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.780]  They are a piece of history.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.799]  They're pure silver.
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:26.719]  They are minted here in America.
[02:48:27.850 --> 02:48:29.030]  2,000 of these.
[02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:31.489]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[02:48:31.829 --> 02:48:35.889]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[02:48:36.149 --> 02:48:37.129]  They are incredible.
[02:48:37.430 --> 02:48:43.909]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:48:44.010 --> 02:48:52.020]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:55.360]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:58.299]  So get this amazing coin now.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:12.329]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:14.950]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:18.049]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[02:49:18.209 --> 02:49:21.090]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:23.629]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[02:49:23.770 --> 02:49:25.489]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:28.690]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:30.989]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[02:49:31.190 --> 02:49:32.250]  They surprised me with this.
[02:49:32.329 --> 02:49:33.350]  I just learned this morning.
[02:49:33.370 --> 02:49:37.709]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[02:49:37.930 --> 02:49:40.030]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:40.229 --> 02:49:45.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[02:49:45.350 --> 02:49:48.270]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:50.309]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[02:49:50.489 --> 02:49:52.049]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:55.129]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:58.889]  We've probably got 15 of those elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[02:49:58.889 --> 02:49:59.709]  We have a lot of fun.
[02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:03.670]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[02:50:03.989 --> 02:50:05.750]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[02:50:05.850 --> 02:50:06.569]  And I already called them.
[02:50:06.709 --> 02:50:08.709]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[02:50:08.770 --> 02:50:09.610]  So that means there's...
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:13.120]  1,900 and something of these.
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.780]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:18.200]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:19.479]  All my problems would be solved.
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:20.680]  We would have plenty of fun.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:22.440]  This baby is amazing.
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:27.799]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[02:50:27.959 --> 02:50:31.700]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.979]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[02:50:35.299 --> 02:50:35.639]  Fully prepared.
[02:50:35.659 --> 02:50:43.120]  Posable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[02:50:43.239 --> 02:50:51.280]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump meeting inaugurated next month.
[02:50:51.479 --> 02:50:53.100]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[02:50:53.319 --> 02:51:01.340]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot Year, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:51:10.629 --> 02:51:12.069]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:13.149 --> 02:51:14.250]  Jay and I are set to take over.
[02:51:14.829 --> 02:51:19.889]  I've commandeered the fourth hour of the last couple months with the election, but wanted to get him back on.
[02:51:19.989 --> 02:51:20.850]  Then no one's shorter coming up.
[02:51:21.870 --> 02:51:23.250]  Again, the paradox is here.
[02:51:23.329 --> 02:51:25.709]  The great folks at the AlexJoneStore.com, I don't own it.
[02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:26.430]  They're great sponsors.
[02:51:26.510 --> 02:51:30.549]  They're a great company, Bigley, that supplies so many of the best Patriot gear and other things around the country to other talk show hosts.
[02:51:31.489 --> 02:51:32.590]  They've been coming to me for a long time.
[02:51:32.649 --> 02:51:33.969]  I want to be a sponsor, and I finally did it.
[02:51:35.149 --> 02:51:37.889]  And I told them, they make the decisions.
[02:51:37.889 --> 02:51:41.149]  I said, I'd make $5,000 of this first coin design I came with.
[02:51:41.250 --> 02:51:42.350]  And I kind of forgot about it.
[02:51:42.409 --> 02:51:44.889]  And they finally came in, $2,000 of them.
[02:51:45.270 --> 02:51:47.290]  And I said, that's a really hot coin.
[02:51:47.290 --> 02:51:48.950]  You should have gotten $5,000.
[02:51:49.370 --> 02:51:51.270]  And it looks like these will sell out by tomorrow.
[02:51:51.709 --> 02:51:54.329]  And again, if we sell $2,000 of these, great.
[02:51:54.489 --> 02:51:55.729]  That'll get some extra funds in.
[02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:59.690]  And then I didn't think of the Trump on a stump like Elf on a Shelf.
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:01.879]  I saw that this morning.
[02:52:02.079 --> 02:52:02.799]  We haven't gotten them yet.
[02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:03.360]  They're up in Arkansas.
[02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:05.200]  They're shipping out there by right now, including us.
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.079]  I went, tell me they made $20,000 of those.
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:09.500]  They said, nope, $2,000.
[02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:16.959]  I said, that's going to sell out today, but only $2,000, especially at $19.
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:18.639]  It costs, I think, almost $10.
[02:52:19.219 --> 02:52:21.020]  It's like $9 or something else.
[02:52:21.579 --> 02:52:24.959]  That'll make us some money, but we would have solved our problems for months.
[02:52:24.979 --> 02:52:25.940]  I'm not mad at anybody.
[02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:30.459]  I'm very excited, but it's like, It's like, wow.
[02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:34.340]  Because I knew when I saw this sell today, I said, that's going to sell out today.
[02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:35.120]  Oh, come on.
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:36.340]  It's not going to sell out today.
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:42.239]  Because, you know, we don't sell 2,000 or something in a week.
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:45.680]  But listen, it's okay.
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:49.360]  He'll hopefully still be president and not dead next year.
[02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:57.700]  But this is how we're staying on the air with the Democratic Party spending $326 million they filed in court last week against trying to shut me down.
[02:52:58.299 --> 02:53:00.379]  By the way, if you're a new viewer, you don't believe me.
[02:53:00.459 --> 02:53:01.600]  It's in the news.
[02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:02.360]  They said it in court.
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:05.299]  You don't believe they asked for $2.76 trillion?
[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:06.000]  That's Bloomberg.
[02:53:06.659 --> 02:53:08.079]  That's how much money they claim I have.
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:17.870]  So, the point is we're, like, excited about selling 2,000 elf toys for 1995. I can beat these people.
[02:53:18.090 --> 02:53:19.670]  I only need...
[02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:22.790]  I filed a whole bunch of lawsuits on them that they're in deep trouble.
[02:53:22.889 --> 02:53:23.989]  They're in total panic mode.
[02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:26.209]  I just need your support.
[02:53:26.430 --> 02:53:32.889]  So we're going to sell out of the Trump on a stump Christmas bobble that's amazing.
[02:53:33.809 --> 02:53:37.149]  And we're going to sell these silver coins.
[02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:38.610]  But we've got plenty of the amazing...
[02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:48.040]  Ultimate Superfood, Irish Seamoss, a lot of other great supplements that are on the AlexShieldStore.com, but let me show you the new t-shirts.
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:54.379]  Now, these are designs I came up with, and I personally think this will be one of the best sellers ever.
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:55.280]  We put the 47 up.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:53:58.299]  That is a badass shirt.
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:54:01.079]  That is the best Trump 47 shirt out there.
[02:54:01.079 --> 02:54:11.799]  That is my idea, and I knew that The Verizon, you know, better covers than Verizon Trump shirt would be a big seller.
[02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:12.959]  It is a best seller.
[02:54:13.479 --> 02:54:14.700]  I think this is way better.
[02:54:14.940 --> 02:54:16.200]  I'm going to wear this.
[02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:18.340]  This is the Trump shirt I'm going to wear.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.399]  That's available at thealexjohnstore.com.
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:24.799]  And this is a war.
[02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:27.040]  It takes money to win wars.
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:28.299]  And they got it in stock.
[02:54:28.479 --> 02:54:29.420]  They're making them right now.
[02:54:30.909 --> 02:54:33.629]  They are shipping within two days of your order coming in.
[02:54:33.850 --> 02:54:36.430]  You've got to get your orders in by the 16th to get it before Christmas.
[02:54:36.649 --> 02:54:37.649]  It's all shipped out of Arkansas.
[02:54:37.649 --> 02:54:38.950]  They do the t-shirts.
[02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:39.530]  They make them.
[02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:40.190]  They make it all.
[02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:41.670]  And they ship out of Arkansas.
[02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:42.649]  They have their own fulfillment center.
[02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:43.750]  They are great patriots.
[02:54:43.809 --> 02:54:44.049]  You know them.
[02:54:44.129 --> 02:54:44.610]  We've had them in here.
[02:54:46.049 --> 02:54:50.190]  So, I mean, they are, I told them, I said, should you stop so many designs?
[02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:52.149]  Can you keep having that many on stock?
[02:54:52.290 --> 02:54:53.030]  They said, no, it's fine.
[02:54:53.409 --> 02:54:58.110]  There's over 250 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now at thealexshundestore.com.
[02:54:58.229 --> 02:55:10.190]  It is definitely the biggest patriot, anti-New World Order, Trump, anti-globalist, 1776 Americana clothing shop in the galaxy.
[02:55:11.909 --> 02:55:16.909]  So, You get excited about fighting tyranny, we win.
[02:55:17.149 --> 02:55:18.670]  You get excited about getting Trump in, we won.
[02:55:18.850 --> 02:55:19.709]  This is a fight.
[02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:23.209]  The best Trump year, the best Patriot year, the best Infowars year, it's all there.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:28.940]  Alright, I'll be back tomorrow at 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:30.520]  Only on the Alex Jones Network.
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:32.479]  So tomorrow, the Alex Jones Network.
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:33.879]  You'll see it on Real Alex Jones as well.
[02:55:34.079 --> 02:55:35.500]  Very special transmission.
[02:55:35.659 --> 02:55:37.040]  Getting ready in case they shut us down Monday.
[02:55:37.239 --> 02:55:38.239]  Out of the new studios.
[02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:39.079]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[02:55:39.159 --> 02:55:39.840]  It's coming up.
[02:55:40.059 --> 02:55:42.479]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:44.280]  Glad to be back here hosting with you guys.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:45.659]  It's been a few weeks.
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:47.399]  Maybe even a month or two.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:50.219]  But I always love hosting the fourth hour.
[02:55:50.379 --> 02:55:51.459]  It's a great honor.
[02:55:52.219 --> 02:55:52.620]  And...
[02:55:53.219 --> 02:55:58.299]  Something kind of revolutionary hit me this week, and I wanted to talk about that today.
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.840]  We're going to tie it into history.
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:09.540]  We're going to tie it into the machinations of the British Empire, the founding of our deep state through the British spies that you heard Alex reference earlier.
[02:56:09.700 --> 02:56:11.059]  He talked about Ian Fleming and others.
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:20.340]  And I'm going to talk about some other characters adjacent to Ian Fleming and why they were so enveloped in what's called the Great Game.
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:36.000]  This is the beginning of Towards the end of the 1800s, 1900-ish era, the battle between Russia and the Anglo-American establishment, or what would eventually be called the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:42.520]  That is, nowadays, it's the Western power structure, the Atlantis' power structure, which is still in power.
[02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:44.309]  We're good to go.
[02:57:05.079 --> 02:57:17.120]  A lot of times, other things are also having massive paradigm shift level stuff going on, such as economics, such as technology, industrialization.
[02:57:17.819 --> 02:57:25.180]  And so 100 years ago, there was a massive change in the world centered around the discovery of oil.
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:33.840]  It's a little more than 100 years ago, but the race to get oil became one of the motivating factors behind the great game.
[02:57:34.299 --> 02:57:54.299]  And this involves people like the British Empire and their key spies, but also spies from the French and spies from the Tsar and spies even from Germany and other countries racing to get control of the Baku oil fields and oil in places like Iran.
[02:57:55.079 --> 02:58:07.979]  So when we talk about the Baku oil fields and we talk about these machinations to try to get control of these regions, This is what the British Empire was primarily up to.
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:14.739]  And I have been reading a really good book on the history of espionage this week by an author who's a French historian and writer.
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:15.860]  His name is Giles Meunier.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:18.569]  You wrote a great book called Black Gold Spies.
[02:58:18.889 --> 02:58:25.690]  If you by chance got to see Sam Tripoli a few weeks ago on the Joe Rogan podcast, it was a great interview.
[02:58:26.209 --> 02:58:29.430]  Sam Tripoli gave me a big shout out, so props to Sam Tripoli for that.
[02:58:29.530 --> 02:58:33.870]  Be sure and follow not just Joe Rogan, but also Sam Tripoli on X and everywhere else.
[02:58:33.909 --> 02:58:36.229]  He has a great podcast, funny comedian.
[02:58:36.450 --> 02:58:37.629]  We've done a lot of shows with Sam.
[02:58:37.649 --> 02:58:39.670]  He's been on here on the fourth hour with me a few times.
[02:58:43.400 --> 02:58:46.200]  I think?
[02:59:06.610 --> 02:59:09.610]  And some of these famous spies, they were wild men.
[02:59:09.770 --> 02:59:11.290]  I mean, they did some crazy stuff.
[02:59:11.870 --> 02:59:22.489]  Dressing up like Catholic priests, dressing up like sheikhs, dressing up like imams, and going and doing all kinds of wild adventures and whatnot for the British Empire.
[02:59:22.909 --> 02:59:24.350]  And why were they doing this?
[02:59:24.489 --> 02:59:28.450]  Well, obviously there's the strategic control of the resources and all that.
[02:59:28.590 --> 02:59:32.930]  But a lot of it had to do with that key resource at this time, which was gold.
[02:59:33.149 --> 02:59:34.829]  Black gold spies.
[02:59:35.530 --> 02:59:50.989]  Now, I did a video on my channel a few weeks ago covering the CIA coup in Iran, the famous 1953 coup, where Kermit Roosevelt and others overthrew Mohamed Mossadegh for the CIA to put the Shah in.
[02:59:51.709 --> 03:00:07.610]  And a lot of that had to do with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which we now know of as BP. At that time, however, it had been nationalized because they didn't feel like the rate of exchange and what the Iranian people were getting was good enough.
[03:00:07.690 --> 03:00:17.989]  And so this ended up being one of the first of the most notorious declassified CIA coups for the purpose of BP and other Western oil interests.
[03:00:18.069 --> 03:00:19.889]  But that's nothing new.
[03:00:20.549 --> 03:00:37.069]  In fact, there were many spies doing this kind of stuff years earlier for the British Empire prior to World War I. People like T.E. Lawrence, people like Sidney Riley, people like Bruce Lockhart, people like even a guy named Shakespeare,
[03:00:37.090 --> 03:00:38.530]  who we're going to talk about a little bit.
[03:00:38.549 --> 03:00:41.670]  He's an interesting guy, not William Shakespeare, but he's named after that guy.
[03:00:42.879 --> 03:00:48.379]  But I want to point out that a lot of people at this time were very apt to use religious cover.
[03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:58.200]  So this shows us that the state has always seen religion as an easy cover, an easy way to infiltrate and to change other countries.
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:04.399]  This is primarily why, in many cases, certain countries are hostile to Christianity.
[03:01:04.719 --> 03:01:10.860]  For example, communist states, China and others, They're not just hostile to Christianity because they're atheist states.
[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:11.299]  They are.
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:13.180]  They're committed to those atheist principles.
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:18.360]  But they're also hostile because they know in history that missionaries have famously been spies.
[03:01:18.620 --> 03:01:25.040]  Most people don't know this, though, that people are very naive when it comes to this kind of stuff, when it comes to history and the great games.
[03:01:25.159 --> 03:01:33.940]  So they don't really know that that's a real principle behind mission work is actually imperial espionage and reconnaissance.
[03:01:34.459 --> 03:01:38.040]  And some of the famous characters that were missionary spies I'm going to talk about.
[03:01:38.139 --> 03:01:50.719]  But the reason I'm mentioning this is not just to give you some boring history lecture, but to make it very apt to today, there was a person kind of adjacent, I guess you could say, to the new administration that's coming in.
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:56.079]  And I was listening to a bunch of financial podcasts, and they were talking about the new oil.
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:02:01.979]  And the new oil is rumored in certain circles to be speculated to be Bitcoin.
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:03.739]  I believe that it is.
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:06.239]  I've believed in Bitcoin since 2016-17.
[03:02:06.959 --> 03:02:12.319]  I wasn't as early as Max Keiser, but I did listen to a lot of Max Keiser over the years, and he eventually convinced me.
[03:02:12.899 --> 03:02:16.739]  But I did beat Michael Saylor, so I was about three or four years earlier than Michael Saylor.
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:24.299]  But the reason that I think Bitcoin makes sense is going to be related to what we're going to talk about today.
[03:02:24.399 --> 03:02:27.079]  So we're going to go pretty deep, so hang with me here, because...
[03:02:28.059 --> 03:02:33.299]  We know that when oil was discovered, this was an industrial revolution across the world.
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:35.139]  This became one of the most valuable commodities.
[03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:38.540]  The world just goes to war.
[03:02:38.719 --> 03:02:45.819]  Spies are going and risking their lives for this gooey black goo from the earth.
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:48.000]  It's not dinosaur bones, by the way.
[03:02:48.079 --> 03:02:48.780]  It's not dinosaur juice.
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:51.159]  I don't think.
[03:02:51.260 --> 03:02:52.299]  I don't think it's fossil fuels.
[03:02:52.379 --> 03:02:55.479]  I think that's some kind of weird made-up thing to demonize.
[03:02:56.379 --> 03:02:57.440]  To demonize oil.
[03:02:59.819 --> 03:03:07.760]  But oil begins to be the commodity after this time that really sort of moves the world, hence the term eventually petrodollar.
[03:03:07.879 --> 03:03:10.500]  The dollar becomes linked to oil.
[03:03:11.430 --> 03:03:29.430]  And you have all these machinations with Kissinger and OPEC and Bilderberg in the 1970s to cause that crisis to essentially tie the dollar, which was then removed from the gold standard, I guess, to not just fiat, but in some sense faith in the oil dollar or whatever.
[03:03:30.930 --> 03:03:47.360]  But regardless, it's still a fiat currency, even if there's some kind of loose amorphous faith in the dollar being connected to The dollar is still fiat, and its fiat prowess has been seen,
[03:03:47.719 --> 03:03:51.700]  especially in the Biden administration with all of this massive debt.
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:57.180]  In fact, Elon tweets every two or three days about the national debt and how are we going to pay this off.
[03:03:57.319 --> 03:04:01.159]  So I'm glad that this is becoming such a central focus of so many people.
[03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:07.530]  And, you know, Trump, even in the 2016 election, was talking about the Federal Reserve and how it was a scam.
[03:04:07.850 --> 03:04:21.290]  So I'm glad to see this out there in the ether because this really vindicates a lot of what Ron Paul and, you know, people from that sphere of the Tea Party era of 2007, 8, 9, you know, everybody was talking about auditing the Fed.
[03:04:21.430 --> 03:04:26.270]  Everybody was talking about fixing the debt, the debt crisis, how it can never be repaid.
[03:04:26.909 --> 03:04:34.510]  And it will never be fixed as long as we have a private-run Federal Reserve System with the power to print money.
[03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:51.049]  And the answer to that is to not have a state-controlled or a private-controlled printer that can run up the money supply, which is a temptation that any centralized institution like that will have.
[03:04:51.780 --> 03:04:59.360]  In other words, you can never really give any one group or one guy or one king or one banker the power to coin all the money.
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:10.920]  I mean, isn't it famously Lord Rothschild that said, give me the power to print the money and I care not who the elected leaders are, because he understood the power of the money printer.
[03:05:11.100 --> 03:05:14.340]  The money printer go brr, brr, brr, and it just prints it out.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:16.260]  That allows...
[03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:28.360]  The system to then cycle that money to buy up its own assets and its own treasury bills, its own debt, etc., and then to farm out other debts.
[03:05:28.579 --> 03:05:35.879]  It's a massive debt scheme to then get real assets and real money over time, gold, etc.
[03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:46.909]  But we're entering into a modern age, the information age, where it doesn't really make sense anymore to utilize older conquistador era methods of payment.
[03:05:47.069 --> 03:05:48.129]  Now, I'm not saying gold's bad.
[03:05:48.489 --> 03:05:51.309]  Gold can be harmonized and work with Bitcoin.
[03:05:51.489 --> 03:05:54.309]  In fact, Bitcoin is a kind of digital gold.
[03:05:55.809 --> 03:05:57.729]  So these things are not antithetical.
[03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:58.569]  They work together.
[03:05:58.790 --> 03:06:04.110]  And in fact, I would argue that if you really like gold, you could hold Bitcoin for the next 10 years and buy all the gold you want.
[03:06:04.530 --> 03:06:09.629]  So if you really want gold, the best path to getting more gold, give me me gold.
[03:06:09.870 --> 03:06:11.989]  I want to uproot that tree.
[03:06:12.129 --> 03:06:12.829]  I want the gold.
[03:06:12.989 --> 03:06:14.290]  I want to know where to go at.
[03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:21.649]  If you want the gold, wouldn't it make the most sense to huddle the asset that's the best performing that will probably give you the most gains to buy the most gold?
[03:06:21.989 --> 03:06:24.409]  Anyway, that's just a funny thought I had this week.
[03:06:24.489 --> 03:06:29.829]  But the reason we're talking about black gold, Texas tea, is because...
[03:06:30.620 --> 03:06:38.620]  I had this vision, not literally a vision, but I remember watching some videos on Bitcoin mining and I saw a mining operation that was in Texas.
[03:06:38.920 --> 03:06:49.319]  And it was a bunch of mining rigs in climate controlled containers out in the Texas Chaparral desert land.
[03:06:49.319 --> 03:06:57.899]  And I was like, this looks a lot like oil rigs and derricks and mining of the future.
[03:06:58.520 --> 03:07:02.940]  And I just sort of had this epiphany that what oil was to...
[03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:17.520]  I thought this many, many months ago, so I'm not stealing this from whoever, whatever finance guru guy was saying this on a podcast, but I started thinking, well, you know, used to, you would see giant oil rigs and derricks everywhere.
[03:07:17.639 --> 03:07:20.899]  And I mean, they still exist, obviously, throughout Texas and places like that.
[03:07:21.819 --> 03:07:28.860]  But the last time that I think I was in Austin, when I was on with Alex, we were driving through, And we stopped at a small town.
[03:07:28.959 --> 03:07:34.159]  I can't remember the name of it, but it's a famous Texas town where they had discovered a lot of oil early on.
[03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:41.219]  And this became one of the wealthiest towns in all of perhaps the U.S., maybe in the South.
[03:07:41.299 --> 03:07:41.760]  I don't remember.
[03:07:42.799 --> 03:07:44.360]  And they had all their sort of...
[03:07:44.819 --> 03:07:47.819]  A monument to all of these oil rigs and whatnot.
[03:07:48.239 --> 03:07:50.360]  And the town was not wealthy anymore.
[03:07:50.639 --> 03:07:51.899]  I mean, it wasn't like a ghetto.
[03:07:52.180 --> 03:07:53.100]  It wasn't terrible.
[03:07:53.100 --> 03:08:01.239]  But it certainly wasn't the grandeur that they were, you know, lauding and praising from 100 years ago when you had the oil boom.
[03:08:02.020 --> 03:08:05.920]  And you can think of the gold rush, too, California gold rush and all that.
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:11.899]  So there's these periods when people start to figure out I think?
[03:08:28.930 --> 03:08:31.250]  Over time, I think Max has been vindicated.
[03:08:31.409 --> 03:08:36.110]  He's been borne out in the thesis of that debate between those two.
[03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:41.309]  Peter Schiff said famously that Bitcoin would never reach $100,000.
[03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:52.829]  And so this week, we hit that major milestone of surpassing $100K, which is, I think, a huge psychological resistance level that a lot of people felt could never happen.
[03:08:53.350 --> 03:08:59.170]  And now that we've got the administration understanding it, you've got people like RFK Jr. all in.
[03:08:59.350 --> 03:09:10.030]  You've got so many institutional people, Michael Saylor and others, who have really just been evangelizing in the newer phases of this like Max Keiser did 10, 12 years ago.
[03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:15.469]  I really think we're at the vector point where this is no longer magic internet money.
[03:09:15.569 --> 03:09:18.370]  This is no longer a scam coin.
[03:09:18.370 --> 03:09:19.309]  It's not fake.
[03:09:19.469 --> 03:09:21.809]  People say, oh, well, how is this worth anything?
[03:09:22.319 --> 03:09:23.739]  It's not based on anything.
[03:09:24.020 --> 03:09:36.159]  Well, this is a very sort of boomer era mindset because I think one of the hurdles to the older generation understanding the value proposition here is to think that things only have value that are tied to the physical.
[03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:37.780]  And that's just simply not true.
[03:09:37.879 --> 03:09:38.840]  In fact, it was never true.
[03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:48.940]  But for a long time, many centuries in terms of monetary policy, money was tied to typically something physical like gold or silver.
[03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:51.260]  That's been the standard for the last several hundred years.
[03:09:51.889 --> 03:09:55.950]  But obviously not everything that's physical is what has value.
[03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:57.889]  Ideas have value.
[03:09:58.610 --> 03:10:01.409]  Giant computer networks have value.
[03:10:01.709 --> 03:10:08.270]  And although they might be based in servers, they're not strictly speaking as a network identical to the physical.
[03:10:08.569 --> 03:10:14.489]  So not everything that has immense value is necessarily tied to physicality.
[03:10:14.809 --> 03:10:16.530]  So for example, Facebook.
[03:10:16.530 --> 03:10:18.030]  I'm not a huge fan of Facebook.
[03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:19.110]  I don't use Facebook.
[03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:20.329]  I quit using it years ago.
[03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:26.829]  But just in the sense of a network, it has immense zillions of dollars of value.
[03:10:26.969 --> 03:10:29.549]  I don't know the exact worth of Facebook, but it's a lot.
[03:10:30.569 --> 03:10:33.030]  Is Facebook a physical thing that you hold?
[03:10:33.129 --> 03:10:33.290]  No.
[03:10:33.690 --> 03:10:36.270]  It has immense value as a network.
[03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:44.069]  Now, we know, of course, on our side of things that it's a giant surveillance network, and it profiles and tracks and traces and sensors and all that, yes.
[03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:48.309]  But its value is not just in the fact that it's those things.
[03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:50.750]  Its value is in the fact that it's a gigantic network.
[03:10:50.989 --> 03:11:02.450]  It's a usable network that people find value in at the most basic level through interactions, communications, through, you know, pictures, storing their pictures online and all this, right?
[03:11:02.530 --> 03:11:04.309]  The ease, the simplicity and all that.
[03:11:04.489 --> 03:11:06.010]  That's part of that value.
[03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:17.409]  So the idea that a giant global network with 10,000 plus nodes that is the most powerful network on the earth, that it doesn't have value is just simply idiotic and foolish.
[03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:18.909]  It's based in ignorance.
[03:11:19.319 --> 03:11:20.819]  And I'm not even a tech guy.
[03:11:20.979 --> 03:11:22.420]  I'm just a book guy.
[03:11:22.479 --> 03:11:29.700]  But I can at least understand that, yeah, philosophically speaking, value is not inherently tied to the physical.
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:33.540]  That doesn't mean that things that are not physical are more valuable necessarily.
[03:11:34.040 --> 03:11:36.420]  You can have valuable physical things.
[03:11:36.680 --> 03:11:41.260]  Our lives, our families, our bodies, our food, all those things are physical.
[03:11:41.799 --> 03:11:44.520]  But not everything that's valuable is physical.
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:48.139]  So that's the first hurdle that so many people have to this kind of a thinking.
[03:11:48.610 --> 03:11:50.110]  But we're in the information age.
[03:11:50.290 --> 03:11:51.889]  We're not in the conquistador age.
[03:11:52.030 --> 03:12:00.409]  We're not going to be sailing dragoons and warships around and trading giant chests of gold like Peter Schiff and people think.
[03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:10.049]  We're in the age where obviously the internet age is going to use a transaction that can occur across the world 24-7 within minutes.
[03:12:11.270 --> 03:12:13.549]  And that it's safe, secure, and so forth.
[03:12:13.610 --> 03:12:18.870]  There's no trust that's involved in trusting banks and Private central bankers and ledgers and all this.
[03:12:19.170 --> 03:12:20.930]  That's the old legacy system.
[03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:32.469]  So what happened with the oil revolution was people figured out this substance can be used to power an entirely new market of motor vehicles, etc.
[03:12:33.510 --> 03:12:48.680]  And this will revolutionize commerce because people will be able to trade much easier and much quicker Through oil, through gasoline, through powering the speed of transactions and commerce that comes from oil.
[03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:52.420]  And thus, a lot of people will be wealthy from oil.
[03:12:52.680 --> 03:13:00.120]  And everybody knows about Standard Oil and the Rockefellers and everybody making immense amounts of money from oil.
[03:13:01.969 --> 03:13:05.649]  But we're in an era now, and I'm not saying, this is not the dis-oil.
[03:13:05.709 --> 03:13:08.190]  I don't really have any, I'm not anti-oil.
[03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:10.610]  I think there's nothing wrong with oil.
[03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:14.989]  I don't think it's been demonized and attacked as if it's like, you know, killing the planet.
[03:13:15.149 --> 03:13:17.049]  I think it's actually something that comes from the planet.
[03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:18.010]  It's not killing the planet.
[03:13:18.329 --> 03:13:22.510]  A lot of the environmental stuff is propaganda from people who want oil.
[03:13:22.909 --> 03:13:37.469]  Central bank digital currencies want austerity, who want to shut down commerce, to shut down the power and creativity of millions and millions of people working and doing what they want to do with their own creativity.
[03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:39.690]  The elite do not want that.
[03:13:39.809 --> 03:13:42.329]  So they prefer any kinds of systems that are centralized.
[03:13:43.079 --> 03:13:44.299]  Bitcoin is not centralized.
[03:13:44.540 --> 03:13:45.520]  That's precisely why.
[03:13:45.719 --> 03:13:47.500]  It doesn't have a CEO. It doesn't have an office.
[03:13:47.659 --> 03:13:53.059]  There's no corporate head that you go attack and arrest, which would, of course, destroy it if there was such a thing.
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:54.540]  The network would collapse.
[03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:56.299]  It would be shut down and all this kind of stuff.
[03:13:56.440 --> 03:14:00.620]  That doesn't exist with this, and that's precisely why it's unique.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:12.389]  And all of the objectors, all the FUD, all the arguments that I've been hearing from people for 10-plus years are The arguments that I've argued against people for seven to eight years, it's like it never changes.
[03:14:12.569 --> 03:14:13.469]  It's the mark of the beast.
[03:14:13.610 --> 03:14:16.930]  If anything is the mark of the beast, it would be a digital dollar.
[03:14:17.090 --> 03:14:24.909]  It would be the Fiat Federal Reserve System, which steals from you through generational theft via inflation.
[03:14:25.170 --> 03:14:26.309]  That's a beast system.
[03:14:26.549 --> 03:14:30.870]  The dollar has the freaking all-seeing eye, and it says Novus Ordo Seclorum on it.
[03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:40.909]  Now, that to me is more beastly than the opposite of that, which is the only way that the dollar will be saved, which is to tie it to something that's a hard currency.
[03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:45.090]  Now, for the people that don't understand what that means, that doesn't necessarily mean physicality.
[03:14:45.250 --> 03:14:52.049]  Hard currency can be something that is mathematically objective, immobile, unchangeable, and the protocol can't change.
[03:14:52.170 --> 03:14:53.129]  That's what's objective.
[03:14:53.290 --> 03:14:58.389]  That's why there's only 21 million Bitcoin ever that will ever exist in the last one's mined.
[03:14:58.809 --> 03:15:14.729]  And so you can't inflate that market like every central bank or every state central bank has the temptation to do, to print up more and more money because it's such a lucrative, easy scam when you have the authority to print the money.
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:19.600]  So what this represents is not just a revolution in money and commerce.
[03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:26.979]  It represents a revolution in the way that we think about storing value and energy over time.
[03:15:27.319 --> 03:15:43.399]  And so it becomes the perfect representation of your time and work and energy that you can store in something that is not inflated and thus destroyed via private central banking theft.
[03:15:43.899 --> 03:15:47.420]  That's the value proposition just for the savings side of it.
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:16:00.139]  But it also has an immense superiority of value proposition over things that are very hard to transact and trade, such as giant chests of Spanish doubloons.
[03:16:00.420 --> 03:16:11.139]  Now again, I'm not saying those things aren't value, but when you understand that this is akin to gold, you understand the value proposition of its superiority in all of these domains.
[03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:15.079]  And yeah, there will be volatility, but the dollar is volatile.
[03:16:15.319 --> 03:16:21.739]  The dollar has the volatility of losing purchasing power, immense purchasing power throughout the Biden regime.
[03:16:21.940 --> 03:16:33.819]  And so I think it seems like the bullishness of the Trump administration about Bitcoin, which is one of the best things that's been in the news in a long time, is precisely this element.
[03:16:33.940 --> 03:16:46.680]  Now, in terms of war, In the Black Gold Spies text, we had a lot of wars being fought over controlling this underground resource because it's naturally tied to places on the earth.
[03:16:46.819 --> 03:16:52.079]  And so you need to control that land to suck all the oil out of it.
[03:16:52.940 --> 03:16:54.340]  Think about There Will Be Blood, right?
[03:16:54.479 --> 03:17:01.219]  When Daniel Plainview goes and takes the guy's milkshake and he sucks his milkshake out with his own straw.
[03:17:01.479 --> 03:17:04.399]  They're using the same kind of milkshake together.
[03:17:04.399 --> 03:17:07.360]  It's a very memorable scene in There Will Be Blood.
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:11.520]  And there's a link between the oil and the blood and the fighting for it.
[03:17:12.159 --> 03:17:13.739]  It's a great film, obviously, but...
[03:17:15.059 --> 03:17:25.979]  It also encapsulates the greed and the obsession and the warlike elements that occurred over the resource of black gold.
[03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:33.559]  And that's why so many spies were willing to go and die and willing to risk everything to just find where the oil was.
[03:17:33.739 --> 03:17:38.600]  Again, a lot of this warfare, a lot of this spying, a lot of World War I type stuff, it's about oil.
[03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:55.659]  That doesn't make oil bad, but the point is If you understand the value proposition of what we have with Bitcoin, its superiority is not just in these other ways that we mentioned with speed of transaction, etc., but also the potentiality for peace.
[03:17:55.959 --> 03:18:05.760]  Did you know a lot of war nowadays is not just about oil and resources, but also the fiat dollar is a huge thing that props up so much war in the world.
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:08.879]  Wars are fought over maintaining the petrodollar.
[03:18:09.379 --> 03:18:13.100]  And what if we had a currency that you couldn't really go to war for?
[03:18:13.940 --> 03:18:17.540]  Now, I mean, conceivably, we'll talk about a few options where that might be the case.
[03:18:17.659 --> 03:18:23.700]  But there might even be a world peace-ish proposition behind this new revolution.
[03:18:23.700 --> 03:18:25.139]  This is the Alex Jones Show, don't go anywhere.
[03:18:25.420 --> 03:18:26.680]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:18:26.879 --> 03:18:31.979]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[03:18:33.039 --> 03:18:36.540]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:18:36.780 --> 03:18:39.360]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:40.239]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:18:41.200 --> 03:18:42.559]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:43.639]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[03:18:43.719 --> 03:18:44.500]  I'm not going to buy that shit.
[03:18:45.299 --> 03:18:48.000]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:49.840]  Oh, no.
[03:18:51.059 --> 03:18:52.700]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:18:53.299 --> 03:18:58.840]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:18:59.739]  That's why, right here.
[03:19:00.340 --> 03:19:05.559]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:07.379]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:19:07.559 --> 03:19:09.299]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[03:19:12.069 --> 03:19:15.989]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:18.889]  And I am doing a plug here because, you know, we could be shut down.
[03:19:19.090 --> 03:19:19.569]  I'm going to get it.
[03:19:19.889 --> 03:19:22.770]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:19:22.909 --> 03:19:26.090]  But we'll continue on in the year one way or another, working with great folks.
[03:19:26.590 --> 03:19:28.670]  I was John John Mugasos, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:19:28.889 --> 03:19:34.969]  We're talking about black gold spies, this excellent history tax from Giles Meunier.
[03:19:35.850 --> 03:19:43.909]  And we're talking about the rush that the empires and the powers at the time of the Great Game in World War I had to get gold.
[03:19:44.209 --> 03:19:55.850]  I mean, excuse me, to get oil, black gold, and to find where this was underground so that they could have the edge, the advantage, because they had foreseen, they had realized, this is going to change the world.
[03:19:55.870 --> 03:20:00.829]  And whoever stacks up the land and controls it for...
[03:20:01.939 --> 03:20:07.579]  Oil resource purposes will go into the future with a lot of money, a lot of power.
[03:20:07.680 --> 03:20:17.819]  And I was making the analogy, as some analysts are beginning to make, to where Bitcoin isn't just akin to gold, but it's almost kind of akin to oil.
[03:20:18.579 --> 03:20:21.420]  In the sense of what kind of revolution we're talking about.
[03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:30.659]  Because if Michael Saylor and Max Keiser and others are correct in their basic thesis, this is really the answer to mankind's monetary problems.
[03:20:30.780 --> 03:20:32.700]  It doesn't mean that all problems are gonna go away.
[03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:38.459]  Obviously, the root of our problems are that we're fallen human beings and we need to be reconciled to God, etc.
[03:20:38.799 --> 03:20:44.690]  But in terms of the world, There have been many inventions that have come about providentially that have made life better, made life easier.
[03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:46.969]  A lot of medical inventions, a lot of Tesla's inventions.
[03:20:47.690 --> 03:20:51.110]  So, you know, inventions can be good things or they can be bad things.
[03:20:51.829 --> 03:20:52.610]  They're neutral.
[03:20:53.209 --> 03:20:55.850]  And likewise, money is not in itself bad.
[03:20:56.069 --> 03:21:02.629]  Money is a tool, a medium of exchange, a store of value, a symbol of our time and energy, etc.
[03:21:04.129 --> 03:21:10.149]  And how do we solve man's issues with money?
[03:21:10.799 --> 03:21:21.719]  In the history of the modern world, modern Europe, etc., the private central banking powers, according to Carol Quigley within the first few hundred pages, have had the power of the issuance of currency.
[03:21:22.159 --> 03:21:32.959]  And even back to the late Middle Ages, they were using gold, but then inflating the gold certificates beyond what the bank actually had.
[03:21:33.059 --> 03:21:35.219]  And that's where we get fiat currency.
[03:21:35.879 --> 03:21:42.680]  It's a pretty new experiment, you could say, within the last 500, 600 years with this trickery that's going on.
[03:21:42.780 --> 03:21:48.700]  Maybe even the Templars were involved in this somehow as the banking power of the Middle Ages, the Medici's and others.
[03:21:49.260 --> 03:21:52.219]  And then we get into the era of the Rothschild banking elites.
[03:21:54.409 --> 03:21:58.690]  But they had pretty much the same strategy, and this is, again, this is according to the establishment.
[03:21:58.690 --> 03:22:00.569]  This isn't my conspiracy theorizing.
[03:22:00.569 --> 03:22:02.690]  This is not from G. Edward Griffin.
[03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:10.629]  This is from Harold Quigley in the first few hundred pages of Tragedy in Hobie, explains that the power structure ruled through the money power.
[03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:14.350]  And so even the state eventually had to capitulate to the money power.
[03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:19.569]  And so the problem, though, is not the state versus the corporate.
[03:22:20.139 --> 03:22:27.420]  Or the state versus the private, you know, this kind of Enlightenment era, libertarian, collectivist, socialist type of debate.
[03:22:27.780 --> 03:22:39.139]  The problem is that really no centralized power should be printing the money because any centralized power printing and controlling the money will inflate it and will probably run big scams.
[03:22:39.459 --> 03:22:48.940]  And even if we were to go back to a gold standard, which would be infinitely better perhaps than the fiat standard, there's still the possibility of going off of the gold standard and going back to fiat.
[03:22:49.819 --> 03:22:56.139]  Even if we got rid of Keynesianism and we went back to something else, gold can still be inflated.
[03:22:56.239 --> 03:22:57.620]  You can always discover more gold.
[03:22:57.700 --> 03:22:59.180]  You can always add gold to the market.
[03:22:59.540 --> 03:23:04.700]  But you can't do that with Bitcoin, and that's why it's such a premier rare asset.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.719]  It is the ultimate rare asset, commodity, money, etc.
[03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:08.600]  It's all those things.
[03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:16.100]  Thus, it is kind of the new oil as well, in the sense of how it will revolutionize economics and so forth.
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:19.200]  And for so long, people have thought this was crazy.
[03:23:19.680 --> 03:23:23.639]  And now here we are where nation states are beginning to do this and adopt this.
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:28.639]  Now, granted, it's only small nation states like Bhutan and El Salvador that are beginning to do this.
[03:23:29.280 --> 03:23:32.200]  But now it's the United States that's talking about that.
[03:23:32.479 --> 03:23:42.459]  Now it's Michael Saylor giving talks to the Microsoft board as to whether They should vote to include Bitcoin on their balance sheet.
[03:23:42.979 --> 03:23:50.459]  So you understand, we're at the tipping point to where this is not the drug laundering cartel money stuff.
[03:23:50.739 --> 03:23:52.899]  That's the FUD from 10 years ago.
[03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:53.860]  That's old school.
[03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:56.159]  That's not where we are anymore.
[03:23:56.180 --> 03:24:00.879]  We have mass ETF institutional adoption of this.
[03:24:01.219 --> 03:24:02.659]  Okay, it's not going to...
[03:24:02.659 --> 03:24:04.360]  We're throwing out Gary Gensler.
[03:24:04.500 --> 03:24:06.200]  And even Gary Gensler wasn't against Bitcoin.
[03:24:06.780 --> 03:24:09.819]  So people need to understand, get with the program.
[03:24:10.299 --> 03:24:13.200]  This is not 2015 anymore.
[03:24:13.979 --> 03:24:19.440]  That's three, four cycles ago when people thought that this was going to be banned by the governments of the world.
[03:24:20.049 --> 03:24:22.729]  I tweeted about this today, and I was in tons of comments.
[03:24:22.829 --> 03:24:24.090]  The governments are going to ban it.
[03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:25.030]  It's the mark of the beast.
[03:24:25.430 --> 03:24:27.950]  None of that makes any sense when you understand what Bitcoin actually is.
[03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:37.309]  And again, the dollar is way more of a contender for being the mark of the beast or an E-dollar or a CBDC or something like that versus what we're talking about today.
[03:24:37.909 --> 03:24:48.229]  Now, some of these spies, and the reason we're talking about this is we're sitting here on a gigantic network of the Internet that comes out of the spy world.
[03:24:49.980 --> 03:24:58.459]  Cryptography, which is what computers pretty much are made from, the communications that we're using, it's all from cryptography.
[03:24:58.899 --> 03:25:09.280]  So it's only natural that cryptography would be intimately connected to the future money form, given that the money form of the future, the information age, would be on the internet.
[03:25:10.040 --> 03:25:12.180]  That shouldn't be that controversial.
[03:25:12.299 --> 03:25:17.600]  But we still live in this era when everybody's on the internet, including all the boomers who have all this wealth, they're on the internet.
[03:25:18.649 --> 03:25:23.450]  Sitting there saying that Bitcoin is the mark of the beast and the cashless control grid.
[03:25:23.629 --> 03:25:24.229]  It's not.
[03:25:24.690 --> 03:25:27.489]  And if you really thought that, you wouldn't even be on the internet.
[03:25:27.829 --> 03:25:34.590]  Because the internet would be the infrastructure supposedly for the mark of the beast and the control structure that you're talking about.
[03:25:34.709 --> 03:25:36.149]  So it just literally makes no sense.
[03:25:36.329 --> 03:25:37.389]  Why are you even on the internet?
[03:25:37.629 --> 03:25:42.649]  People are sitting there arguing with me, telling me it's the mark of the beast and the trackable control grid.
[03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:48.870]  While they're on the internet, which is the infrastructure for the control grid that they're arguing against.
[03:25:49.090 --> 03:25:50.290]  So it literally is idiotic.
[03:25:50.690 --> 03:25:52.829]  You wouldn't even be on the internet if you really thought that.
[03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:56.290]  So there's no need to just repeat FUD from 10 years ago to sound smart.
[03:25:56.590 --> 03:26:07.129]  Because I went and listened, by the way, this week to multiple older generation individuals, Dave Ramsey's and others, talking about finance and economics and all this kind of stuff.
[03:26:07.629 --> 03:26:10.409]  And there's just this block that people from that generation...
[03:26:11.620 --> 03:26:14.000]  Cannot grasp when it comes to this topic.
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:22.319]  And they'll sit there and say it's the mark of the beast and it's the control grid as they're on the internet, which makes no sense.
[03:26:22.540 --> 03:26:24.020]  Why are you on the internet if you thought that?
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:30.639]  You would think that the World Wide Web is the control grid track mark of the beast thing, right?
[03:26:31.219 --> 03:26:39.260]  And by the way, 20 years ago, when the internet was just becoming popular, people were saying that, don't get on the internet, it's the mark of the beast, it's gonna track you and control you.
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:40.920]  And it may still do that.
[03:26:41.059 --> 03:26:42.299]  But regardless, here we are.
[03:26:42.459 --> 03:26:43.780]  It's the reality of where we're at.
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:45.780]  So we have to be kind of pragmatic about this.
[03:26:45.899 --> 03:26:50.139]  We can't just be idealistic unless you want to go live in a shed in the woods.
[03:26:50.219 --> 03:26:50.860]  Okay, go for it.
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:51.159]  Have fun.
[03:26:51.239 --> 03:26:51.879]  Go live in a shed.
[03:26:51.940 --> 03:26:52.559]  Bury your gold.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:27:00.979]  And wait for the conquistadors to, you know, come back to the continent and reconquer it for a future Spanish conquistador empire that uses gold.
[03:27:00.979 --> 03:27:01.500]  Go for it.
[03:27:03.020 --> 03:27:10.690]  But the Trump administration, RFK Jr., others, they're all, everyone, even the biggest corporate, even BlackRock, It's now all about Bitcoin.
[03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:12.790]  Does that mean it's controlled?
[03:27:12.909 --> 03:27:13.049]  No.
[03:27:13.209 --> 03:27:16.930]  It's like Max Keiser said, they're kind of the useful idiots that are late to the game.
[03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:24.010]  And so everybody had the chance, the opportunity to front run Wall Street and BlackRock and all of these big institutions into this future of money.
[03:27:25.170 --> 03:27:26.969]  And it's time to just stop being hard-headed.
[03:27:27.149 --> 03:27:32.790]  It's time to learn about the thing that you disagree with and stop repeating what the idiotic mainstream media has told.
[03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:42.069]  The fact that mainstream media says this makes it even more idiotic that you and the alternative media would listen to the flood of the mainstream media when they're the ones that lie to you all the time about everything else.
[03:27:42.629 --> 03:27:44.649]  Why are you listening to them about your money?
[03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:47.450]  That's the stupidest thing to do is to listen to the mainstream media about money.
[03:27:48.610 --> 03:27:51.389]  Everything Jim Cramer says, the opposite happens.
[03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:52.250]  It's even a phenomenon.
[03:27:52.370 --> 03:27:53.250]  It's called inverse Cramer.
[03:27:53.979 --> 03:27:55.680]  That everything Jim Cramer says, the opposite.
[03:27:55.899 --> 03:27:59.479]  If he talks about Bitcoin going down, you know to buy Bitcoin because it's going to go up.
[03:27:59.620 --> 03:28:00.899]  Because he's always wrong.
[03:28:01.340 --> 03:28:11.760]  Just like who was the Keynesian expert economist for the New York Times, whatever that goblin's name was.
[03:28:11.819 --> 03:28:13.600]  He was always saying, the internet's going to die.
[03:28:13.739 --> 03:28:14.420]  It's not the future.
[03:28:15.159 --> 03:28:17.319]  Keynesian economic theory is the answer of that guy.
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:18.659]  Literally always wrong.
[03:28:19.540 --> 03:28:20.940]  Cramer's the new version of that guy.
[03:28:21.860 --> 03:28:24.680]  And it doesn't matter how many times these people are wrong, they always just double down.
[03:28:24.819 --> 03:28:25.379]  It's really bizarre.
[03:28:26.639 --> 03:28:36.180]  But the reason I'm talking about cryptography is that all of what we're interacting with, the Internet, cryptography, which is behind Bitcoin, this is all from the spy world.
[03:28:36.379 --> 03:28:40.760]  You would think people would want to learn about the spy world, perhaps, because it's so fascinating.
[03:28:41.100 --> 03:28:43.520]  It's all over pop culture, much of which is propaganda.
[03:28:45.209 --> 03:28:48.670]  Maybe we should look to the spiral to understand what was going on 100 years ago.
[03:28:48.750 --> 03:28:49.309]  What were they up to?
[03:28:49.409 --> 03:28:53.370]  Well, they were all being sent out by the imperial powers to find gold.
[03:28:53.549 --> 03:28:53.909]  I mean, oil.
[03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:57.629]  Don't you understand?
[03:28:57.889 --> 03:29:00.389]  You're at the front-running ability.
[03:29:00.510 --> 03:29:02.989]  You don't have to be dressing up like a sheik.
[03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:08.750]  To go pretend to be amongst a bunch of crazy Muslims to figure out where oil is.
[03:29:08.850 --> 03:29:09.850]  You don't even have to do that.
[03:29:09.969 --> 03:29:13.989]  You got it so much easier than the spies of 100 plus years ago.
[03:29:14.149 --> 03:29:15.909]  All you got to do is get a freaking wallet.
[03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:19.629]  But anyway, I'm just making jokes.
[03:29:19.770 --> 03:29:22.569]  But I was just thinking of this as I was reading this book.
[03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:31.610]  I was like, these guys are like risking everything, just doing insane stuff to find oil, which makes sense at that time.
[03:29:32.450 --> 03:29:37.809]  For example, when Ian Fleming, who was the author of The Bond Stories, and we've talked about this a million times.
[03:29:37.930 --> 03:29:45.329]  Alex talks about it today, so it was a great providential vibing with Alex's mindset to my mindset as to what I would talk about.
[03:29:46.190 --> 03:29:59.069]  Ian Fleming was recruited in 1939 by the Special Operations Executive, which was what allowed him to go study espionage at Camp X in Canada, which was MI6's special training school.
[03:29:59.510 --> 03:30:05.170]  That was run by William Stevenson, co-name Intrepid, who had a special office at Rockefeller Plaza.
[03:30:05.610 --> 03:30:18.290]  And it's William Stevenson and Ian Fleming and others, including Roald Dahl, yes, that Roald Dahl, who went and helped Bill Donovan set up the OSS. That's where we get our deep state.
[03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:32.180]  All of these people, by the way, are working at the behest of Keynesian economic theory and Fabian socialist elites in the UK. People like Lord Milner, people like the Rothschilds, people like the Cliveden set, the Astros, etc.
[03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:45.659]  Many of those people coming out of that Cecil Rhodes school of thought, the John Ruskin school of thought, were Fabian socialists, and eventually they produced John Maynard Keynes, who is the economic par excellence goblin of the entire modern world.
[03:30:45.940 --> 03:30:49.440]  The IMF, the World Bank, they're all set up on Keynesian principles.
[03:30:49.879 --> 03:30:57.670]  And the reason that everything goes to crap in modern economic theory is precisely this Quasi-socialist economic theory.
[03:30:58.569 --> 03:31:11.790]  And whether or not they're idiots who don't know what they're talking about or whether or not they're cunning deceivers trying to destroy the Western economic system, I would argue the latter because the Fabian socialists said that they would need to collapse and destroy the Western order.
[03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:17.389]  So some of them, at least, are actually cunning and malicious, and they know what they're doing.
[03:31:17.469 --> 03:31:22.549]  They think that to bring in the revolution, the socialist revolution, they have to collapse the existing system.
[03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:25.170]  And they wrote many, many, many, many, many books on that.
[03:31:26.129 --> 03:31:32.430]  So they think that if they can collapse it as it is, they can bring in their controlled, absolutely centralized technocratic system.
[03:31:33.069 --> 03:31:44.889]  Every one of these elites that we've talked about, all the way back to Lord Birkenhead, Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells, Rothschild, Rhodes Milner, they all talked about this centralized technocratic system of the future that they want them.
[03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:47.389]  Huxley, Brave New World, etc.
[03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:56.819]  When Orwell wrote 1984, when Eric Blair wrote 1984, he was writing about his experiences In British intelligence.
[03:31:57.379 --> 03:32:00.280]  And he also thought, well, maybe the socialists have it right.
[03:32:00.659 --> 03:32:03.479]  Then he thought, well, no, maybe actually none of these groups have it right.
[03:32:03.579 --> 03:32:05.920]  Maybe it's a staged dialectical conflict.
[03:32:06.879 --> 03:32:12.040]  Because neither the fake communists nor the monopoly capitalists and elite really had the answers and solutions.
[03:32:12.219 --> 03:32:14.360]  They were all part of this same superstructure.
[03:32:14.440 --> 03:32:20.700]  That's the point of 1984. The communist terror rebellion of Emmanuel Goldstein is fake.
[03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:24.479]  It's a controlled opposition counterintelligence movement.
[03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:26.030]  Run by O'Brien.
[03:32:27.229 --> 03:32:32.870]  And so in the same way, the same power structure, which includes people like Ian Fleming, I don't think Ian Fleming is malicious.
[03:32:33.149 --> 03:32:36.030]  So I studied him intently at grad school.
[03:32:36.290 --> 03:32:37.469]  I think he meant well.
[03:32:37.549 --> 03:32:45.690]  I really do think that he was trying to fight for what he thought was freedom and democracy, as many people in the West did, as many people in the establishment have done.
[03:32:46.090 --> 03:32:52.430]  But eventually you start to realize the problems of the world are not ultimately nation states going to war.
[03:32:52.610 --> 03:32:55.079]  The problems of the world are not This or that.
[03:32:55.180 --> 03:32:56.360]  It's actually the money power.
[03:32:56.540 --> 03:32:59.040]  That's the source of a lot of the world's problems.
[03:32:59.540 --> 03:33:03.700]  And so why don't we think about ways to solve the money problem?
[03:33:04.479 --> 03:33:05.239]  Well, guess what?
[03:33:05.360 --> 03:33:06.940]  I'm arguing that there is a way to solve it.
[03:33:07.280 --> 03:33:20.000]  And we couldn't have had the solution until the age of the internet, until the age of instantaneous electronic transaction communication cryptography that we have now, which comes out of the spy world.
[03:33:20.989 --> 03:33:30.049]  So these spies were all running around, doing all these crazy missions and risking their lives so that their imperial masters could control the resources.
[03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:34.649]  One of the most famous spies that influenced James Bond was a guy named Sidney Riley.
[03:33:35.010 --> 03:33:46.450]  And he worked together with another famous British spy named Bruce Lockhart, who was the attaché, the messenger between Lord Milner and the British Fabian government and the Bolsheviks.
[03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:49.020]  And so Lockhart would go and meet with him.
[03:33:49.399 --> 03:34:04.920]  Anthony Sutton argues that he was actually a Bolshevik agent working together with the Fabian socialists to help destroy Russia, that this was overall an operation during the Cold War, during the Great Game, excuse me, pre-Cold War during the Great Game,
[03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:08.879]  which would lead to the Cold War, to destroy the Tsar Empire.
[03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:17.340]  And this actually does make sense from a strategic standpoint that Bolshevism would be exported to Russia as a Destructive entity.
[03:34:17.840 --> 03:34:19.040]  And you say, well, wait a minute.
[03:34:19.260 --> 03:34:25.360]  That kind of makes sense because it's almost like they've exported the same ideology to America to destroy the West.
[03:34:25.639 --> 03:34:26.079]  Absolutely.
[03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:27.200]  It's a strategy.
[03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:27.860]  It's a technique.
[03:34:28.159 --> 03:34:29.100]  Not accidental.
[03:34:29.260 --> 03:34:29.840]  It's not organic.
[03:34:30.940 --> 03:34:38.700]  It's billions of dollars that go into funding all of these leftist groups and these campaigns and the gender nonsense and Tavistock and all of that.
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:39.979]  That's from the establishment.
[03:34:39.979 --> 03:34:41.360]  It's a top down operation.
[03:34:41.559 --> 03:34:44.260]  It's not an organic bottom up out of nowhere operation.
[03:34:45.010 --> 03:34:48.969]  They fund the toxic culture, which brainwashes your youth, your children.
[03:34:51.149 --> 03:35:07.500]  But at this time, it was necessary for people to do pretty outlandish, wild operations like Sidney Riley going undercover as a priest throughout various places to try to find where the oil fields were and to make sure that I think?
[03:35:31.069 --> 03:35:34.270]  James Bond, his handler's name is M. This is why.
[03:35:34.569 --> 03:35:37.450]  This is where Ian Fleming got all of this.
[03:35:37.770 --> 03:35:44.649]  Now, the question is, was Sidney Riley actually working in the behest of the British Empire, or was he actually working as a Bolshevik?
[03:35:44.829 --> 03:35:45.969]  And it's hard to tell.
[03:35:46.090 --> 03:35:47.129]  There's debate over this.
[03:35:47.430 --> 03:35:59.950]  The Rakowski interrogation has him saying, essentially, or has Rakowski, the Bulgarian socialist leader, saying that Sidney Riley was an operative of the Rothschilds.
[03:36:00.450 --> 03:36:09.709]  You have other theorists saying, no, actually, he was working for the British Empire, but in the end, he defected to the Bolsheviks, and he was never heard from.
[03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:18.569]  In fact, I have Lockhart's memoirs, and he says at the end of the memoirs that Sidney Riley just disappeared into Bolshevik Russia.
[03:36:18.770 --> 03:36:25.170]  So whether he was put to death or whether he became a Bolshevik, we don't know, but he seems to think that he did become a Bolshevik.
[03:36:26.149 --> 03:36:37.569]  But regardless, out of all this, the UK government got control of the Baku oil fields from the spy machinations of Sidney Riley.
[03:36:37.829 --> 03:36:41.549]  The influence behind, one of the influences behind James Bond.
[03:36:41.649 --> 03:36:48.790]  Another influence was a guy named Fitzroy McLean, who was very close, best friends with Ian Fleming for many years.
[03:36:48.989 --> 03:36:52.309]  And I'll quote Meunier towards the end of this chapter.
[03:36:52.590 --> 03:36:53.850]  Ian Fleming was...
[03:36:54.610 --> 03:37:00.510]  He had been perfectly within the spy game of the USSR. He had been fit perfectly with the spy game.
[03:37:00.629 --> 03:37:07.549]  He had been a Reuters correspondent in Moscow from 1929 to 1933. Then he worked as a foreign manager for the London Sunday Times.
[03:37:07.870 --> 03:37:11.610]  Bruce Lockhart had told him the stories of Sidney Riley, ace of spies.
[03:37:13.290 --> 03:37:25.290]  We're good to go.
[03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:42.649]  And Fitzroy McLean became Tito's right-hand man advisor.
[03:37:43.549 --> 03:37:45.149]  These are wild guys.
[03:37:45.309 --> 03:37:55.889]  So here you have these British operatives working together with socialists, with right-wing, quote, fascists, taking over the Galen organization.
[03:37:56.450 --> 03:38:01.309]  The CIA and British intelligence doing that after the Nazis lost.
[03:38:01.549 --> 03:38:03.049]  That becomes German intelligence.
[03:38:03.250 --> 03:38:05.450]  The DDR actually comes from Galen Org.
[03:38:06.170 --> 03:38:11.729]  You have Otto Skorzeny and others working to help Reinhard Galen and others helping the Mossad.
[03:38:11.930 --> 03:38:16.110]  So at this level, things don't operate the way you think they operate.
[03:38:16.430 --> 03:38:32.430]  And the only reason I bring all this up is that the great game is essentially an attempt to control minerals, resources, and oil, and for the West to make sure that Russia can't do that, and before that, to make sure Napoleon couldn't do that.
[03:38:33.040 --> 03:38:40.760]  Because Napoleon saw some of the value in these areas as well, and he sought to wrest India from British control.
[03:38:41.739 --> 03:38:46.600]  And he wanted to move into the Middle East as well, get control of Arabia.
[03:38:47.579 --> 03:38:49.079]  It had a different name at that time.
[03:38:49.180 --> 03:38:57.620]  But you can begin to see that these regions are under the purview of the control of the great world powers at this time.
[03:38:59.059 --> 03:39:12.479]  But it was the Western elite that made sure to destroy any possibility of, and then Germany, by the way, through Kaiser Wilhelm II, any of these other countries stepping in and getting control of these regions.
[03:39:12.719 --> 03:39:19.079]  And so they were able to do this via very wild, outlandish, crazy plots of all of these crazy spies.
[03:39:20.059 --> 03:39:33.889]  Even to the point to where Both Napoleon and Kaiser Wilhelm II were rumored to have converted to Islam when they visited these various countries as they were trying to figure out what regions and areas they wanted to try to take control of.
[03:39:33.989 --> 03:39:35.549]  So why am I saying all this?
[03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:51.489]  Because not only is it fascinating and not only is this really crucial to understanding the modern world and how we got the Middle East that we have today with all these famous spies and We haven't even got to T.E. Lawrence yet, but if you've ever seen Lawrence of Arabia, this is based on the supposed stories of T.E. Lawrence,
[03:39:51.569 --> 03:39:53.790]  and he even put him on the cover of the book here, as you can see.
[03:39:55.030 --> 03:40:00.209]  I actually can't tell if that's Peter O'Toole or who, but it looks like Peter O'Toole or the real guy.
[03:40:00.350 --> 03:40:10.989]  But the point being is we're in a period now where the great powers are conceding beyond, I think, the nation-state.
[03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:16.190]  So the future will not be We're always going to have nation states.
[03:40:16.430 --> 03:40:31.610]  I'm not saying there won't be nation states, but we're moving into a new period to where the possibility of the future of value and money is not going to be so tied to the physical that everybody's going to be fighting everybody over oil or something like this,
[03:40:31.690 --> 03:40:33.590]  or the control of resources.
[03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:35.090]  There will always be some degree of that.
[03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:47.010]  But if the most valuable asset in the world does become something intangible, Like BTC, it stands to reason that there would be a lot more peace in the world.
[03:40:47.170 --> 03:40:53.670]  We wouldn't need giant wars and armies and all this kind of stuff for the control of resources.
[03:40:53.670 --> 03:40:59.250]  Not that there wouldn't be resources, but that the most valuable resource would be something that you can't really go to war over.
[03:40:59.549 --> 03:41:01.729]  You can't go to war to destroy Bitcoin.
[03:41:01.909 --> 03:41:07.530]  You can't go to war to steal everyone's Bitcoin like you can oil fields or like you can gold.
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:16.079]  So the intangibility actually opens up the potentiality for, not literal world peace, but much more peace, you see.
[03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:28.239]  And if you think that that's not possible, well, just think about the Westphalian order and the post-Renaissance international order that was set up, which did provide a lot more peace than prior to that time period.
[03:41:28.540 --> 03:41:30.159]  There's a lot of warfare in the Middle Ages.
[03:41:30.819 --> 03:41:36.379]  And the post Middle Ages period was marked by more peace than previously.
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:57.659]  I'm not being utopian this year, but I'm saying that you can have advances in civilizations and advances to where we can have this future civilization where maybe we do explore space or something like this in some expansive way beyond satellites or whatever.
[03:41:58.120 --> 03:42:03.120]  Maybe we can do these wild, you know, stellar things.
[03:42:03.299 --> 03:42:03.780]  I don't know.
[03:42:03.940 --> 03:42:16.040]  But the point is that to be able to have that kind of a future-oriented civilization, you would have to have a solution to a lot of man's fundamental problems to go into that type of future.
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:20.040]  And what we're talking about today has the potentiality to be that.
[03:42:20.139 --> 03:42:32.600]  And it's already demonstrated that via its rise from zero to To $100,000 within, what, 13, 14, 15, however many years since the beginning.
[03:42:34.579 --> 03:42:41.600]  So I hope you understand that value proposition and that selling point, so to speak, and the potentiality here.
[03:42:41.799 --> 03:42:45.659]  And you don't misunderstand me as if I'm saying that this will bring a utopia and world peace.
[03:42:45.780 --> 03:42:45.920]  No, no.
[03:42:46.180 --> 03:42:49.959]  But the Austrian economic school They did get a lot of things right.
[03:42:50.079 --> 03:42:56.299]  I don't think they got everything right, but they certainly got way more right than the Fabian Socialists and the Keynesian and the Marxists, who are the worst.
[03:42:56.780 --> 03:43:03.899]  But one of the things that they've given is this idea, which becomes digital gold and digital oil and digital store value.
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:06.760]  I think you should look into it if you haven't.
[03:43:06.979 --> 03:43:12.629]  And everybody who puts in the time, Eventually converts and understands that this is the future.
