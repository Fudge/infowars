[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.832]  I want you to know that this is potentially the last broadcast you'll ever see out of these studios and what we're doing here.
[00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:15.834]  Because the Justice Department has come in here and threatened people and intimidated people and turned people against us.
[00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:35.515]  And that's where we are.
[00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:36.703]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:37.423]  Today.
[00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:40.285]  Why do they lie so much?
[00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.965]  They think we're dumb or what's going on?
[00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:42.246]  Yeah.
[00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.607]  They want to tell so many lies that you have time to counter them all.
[00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:47.828]  Because it would take five hours to counter all that.
[00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:49.889]  I mean, I gave up in my note-taking.
[00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.930]  Everything was a lie.
[00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.871]  I mean, the biggest one was like, yeah, this woman got killed by a legal alien.
[00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:55.972]  We're trying to stop that.
[00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:57.493]  I want to shut down the border.
[00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:00.494]  He said, when I win, immediately surge the border.
[00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:06.945]  And then they had the big NGOs, the State Department that funds the UN NGOs, have all the illegals come up here.
[00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.647]  They have UN camps in South America and Central America and in Mexico.
[00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:12.408]  And he's running it all.
[00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.909]  He says, come here.
[00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.351]  They show up by the thousands in Biden shirts.
[00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:18.212]  So he's like, I'm so sad.
[00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:20.594]  The illegal aliens are killing you.
[00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.176]  And many of them are convicted felons, a large portion.
[00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.578]  And then he's acting dumb and saying, oh, no, no, I'm really sad.
[00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:27.919]  Illegal aliens are raping and murdering.
[00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:34.651]  So just that little window there, he's playing the good cop to his own globalist policies.
[00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.173]  Everything that the State Department, the Victoria Nuland's won, and you're absolutely right.
[00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:44.316]  First he comes out and says Trump is Hitler, and then he moves on to Ukraine.
[00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:48.778]  So it's not about the dying cities, not about the fentanyl, the needles, the illegal aliens everywhere.
[00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.087]  Homeless everywhere.
[00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:56.151]  It's all about Ukraine because that's their big model to distract us and also launder money.
[00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:59.033]  So this is a very, very dangerous moment for America.
[00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:07.879]  You think that as things get more intense, which they will, the people in charge desire violence, are trying to provoke a violent?
[00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.439]  Absolutely.
[00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.920]  They can't win in a peaceful fight.
[00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:18.012]  But you have said, contrary to what they say about you, you've said, no, no, remain peaceful, period.
[00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:18.932]  Absolutely.
[00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:24.295]  I mean, what they do is, anytime you're watching corporate establishment, enemy media, you'll see a three-second clip.
[00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:26.477]  That's not, folks, you're being deceived when you see that.
[00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:28.778]  So I'll say, like, this is satire.
[00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:36.402]  It's the modest proposal by the famous Irish essayist and satirist, Swift, that if the world collapses, I'll eat my neighbors.
[00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:37.043]  This is a joke.
[00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:39.264]  But I go, collapse of the world leads to that.
[00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:41.444]  They go, look, he just said, I'll eat my neighbors.
[00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:42.525]  They're deceiving.
[00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:48.927]  It's like that refrigerator game where you have all the little words and you can move the words around and say whatever you want.
[00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:53.248]  They basically take our words, move them around, and that's a deception.
[00:02:53.308 --> 00:03:03.152]  But when you look at what they're saying, conservatives and populists and Christians are going to kill people and they're going to murder people and Trump is going to be a dictator.
[00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.975]  And he's planning to enslave everybody.
[00:03:06.975 --> 00:03:10.175]  But meanwhile, they're the ones taking him off the ballot.
[00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:11.515]  They're the ones indicting him.
[00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:16.175]   They're the ones saying, I mean, the Atlantic Monthly, that's the mouthpiece of Soron, the
[00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:20.575]   mouth of Satan, came out two weeks ago and said, the headline was something like, "Even
[00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.814]  if Trump wins, we're just going to block him."
[00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:26.359]  Well, all Trump did was say, I want a 10 day investigation, which is constitutional.
[00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.781]  They said, they were honest.
[00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:31.404]  They said, even if he wins, we'll just decertify him.
[00:03:31.724 --> 00:03:35.008]  So they've basically indicted him in Georgia for saying, let's investigate.
[00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:39.472]  They're openly saying, we're going to disqualify him and then it's okay.
[00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:41.935]  So again, there's a murder of logic.
[00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:48.300]  And people see that and they're saying, oh, Trump is going to engage in terror and there's white supremacy everywhere.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.482]  So I think you can do two plus two equals four.
[00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.404]  We know false flags are real.
[00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.465]  Provocateurs are real.
[00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:57.468]  We know they tried to stage the kidnapping of Governor Whitmer and multiple trials.
[00:03:57.548 --> 00:03:58.309]  People got released.
[00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.490]  They finally got the third trial.
[00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.232]  Sent a few to prison where you've got a bunch of marijuana.
[00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:03.674]  You've covered it detailed.
[00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:06.116]  A bunch of potheads, friendly little guys.
[00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:09.635]   they're homeless and then they tell them we'll give you ten thousand dollars a
[00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:13.596]   month if you just meet with us and just say you'll kidnap Whitmer
[00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:16.756]   so you're going to see a lot more of that and and i just we need to disavow
[00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.415]   that because that doesn't fix it
[00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:23.415]   we're winning the culture war
[00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:28.836]   so they want to induce us into violence and they've said they're introducing legislation
[00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:31.954]   of the democratic party in the house and senate to strip
[00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:37.155]   trump of the insurrection act uh... which george or walker bush usually l_a_ riots
[00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:42.570]  And they're saying, oh, we know when he gets elected, if he does, there's going to be huge uprisings.
[00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.009]   and he's a white supremacist so we've got to drive him from office that way so they're planning
[00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.610]   to torch the country when he's president-elect before he's in and try to intimidate everyone
[00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.209]   so black lives matter and antifa and all of this uh Hezbollah Hamas protests and again i'm not
[00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.955]   against i'm not for the war i'm I don't like how far Israel's gone.
[00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:21.503]  But they're invoking that and hyping that up now as their third rail or their fifth column as the Islamicist to then burn the country down within weeks of him being president-elect and thinking they can terrorize the American people and the establishment into removing Trump somehow during that period.
[00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:23.024]  They've already pre-announced that.
[00:05:23.404 --> 00:05:25.525]  So I'm telling you now, eight months out, that's their plan.
[00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:32.196]  I haven't heard one person, including Joe Biden tonight, explain why have they done this?
[00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:33.295]  What is the purpose?
[00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:36.935]   Well, I love how you played Merrick Garland earlier, and he's like, "Yo, there's all these
[00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:37.935]  racists.
[00:05:37.935 --> 00:05:39.175]  They're trying to keep people from voting."
[00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:42.134]  How many cities, how many blue cities let illegals vote?
[00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:47.974]   In San Francisco, they put a foreigner, not even a citizen, on the board of elections
[00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:48.974]  in San Francisco.
[00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:50.576]  Yeah, Chinese national.
[00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:51.576]  Absolutely.
[00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:52.896]  So, like, Chai Com.
[00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:56.014]  So they're just normalizing this.
[00:05:56.014 --> 00:06:00.295]   And of course, you had Colonel McGregor on a few days ago, and he said, literally, they're
[00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:02.855]  bringing in the foreign army.
[00:06:02.855 --> 00:06:04.755]  But it won't happen overnight with you in blue helmets.
[00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:05.935]  It's just they're now your police.
[00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:07.677]  They've already purged the military.
[00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:08.718]  They bring them in.
[00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:09.778]  They'll follow orders.
[00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:11.218]  This is very simple.
[00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.360]  So Rome took 400 years of bringing in foreign troops to fall.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.880]  They didn't do it on purpose.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.923]  But the globalists look at 1984 as fiction, or they look at Rome, which was historical, and they go, that is a blueprint.
[00:06:26.363 --> 00:06:27.703]  That is an owner's manual.
[00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:29.244]  That is a battle plan.
[00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:40.448]  So that's what the Great Reset is, is accelerating the collapse of Western civilization, because you don't want in around to compete with the globalist model of eat the bugs and enslavement and collapse.
[00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:45.770]  So they're actively seeing prosperity and Christian nationalist freedom.
[00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.912]   God forbid the rest of the world pick up Western culture.
[00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:58.079]  So you brand it as racist, you say it's bad, because it's like kryptonite, you know, to Superman, or holy water, and high noon to a vampire.
[00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:06.726]  If people say, I want my Second Amendment, I want my due process, I want my capitalism, well then it's over for the Black Rocks and the Googles and the Facebooks.
[00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:31.620]   So that's why they're fundamentally branding freedom as a white evil thing, because let's face it, Western civilization did develop From Greece on, this incredible thing that could uplift humanity so you discredit it by making it racial instead of selling it to the world and having everyone adopt it and creating unification, not through centralization or enslavement, but through adoption because it works so well.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.224]  And so the globalist tyrants are fundamentally threatened by Western Christian civilization, and that's why they're at war with it.
[00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:57.895]  Which is why we should embrace it, and that's why the great numbers of double the blacks voting for Trump, or triple the Hispanics, what we just saw 10 years ago, and that's why they're in full panic mode trying to bring in totally uninformed foreigners from all over who they control and who they can run through NGOs hoping that they'll be the savior.
[00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:02.377]   So as negative as all this is, I see this as the panic button being hit.
[00:08:03.658 --> 00:08:12.561]  He and the whole establishment is so emblematic of a rotting, collapsing facade that knows the people have turned against it, and it's just pure rage.
[00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:20.245]  All the fakeness, all the pop and serpent stance has been stripped away, and now there's just this seething, ancient dinosaur.
[00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:26.648]  In fact, I was watching, you know, earlier during the State of the Union, and then sitting here watching earlier, I was thinking, how do I start this?
[00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:34.831]   I want to say, it's like we're in a time machine Looking back on the age of the dinosaurs, the Paleolithic or something.
[00:08:36.052 --> 00:08:45.715]  You mentioned the Atlantic, which is owned by a tech oligarch, Steve Jobs' widow, and almost everything bad in the country is financed by the richest people in the country, I've noticed, the oligarchs.
[00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:50.718]  And so all the money is kind of arrayed against the population of the country.
[00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:52.438]  That worries me.
[00:08:52.718 --> 00:08:58.421]  Can you throw off the yoke if the yoke has, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars?
[00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:01.375]  I think we are, thanks to Elon Musk.
[00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:05.118]  I mean, you can say what you want about Elon Musk with all his past activities.
[00:09:05.158 --> 00:09:06.900]  He's trying to dominate every technological sector.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.562]  But Christ said, judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:11.063]  Yes.
[00:09:11.263 --> 00:09:12.143]  And the last two years...
[00:09:13.022 --> 00:09:16.861]   let's say it's a 360, like right here is New World Order, right here is Total Patriot.
[00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:19.662]   Musk was already over here. He wasn't a bad guy, but he wasn't perfect.
[00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:29.342]   He's moved basically a 180. So he's like, "Alec, you're the biggest guy in media."
[00:09:29.342 --> 00:09:29.901]  No.
[00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:30.861]  No, no, no. It's true.
[00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:31.861]  Let's just go to school.
[00:09:32.142 --> 00:09:32.942]  It's not about bragging.
[00:09:32.982 --> 00:09:33.283]  It's true.
[00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:38.365]  You're the biggest mainline talk show host, mainline professional show.
[00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.026]  There's a lot of people under you like me.
[00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.826]  Elon Musk is way bigger than both of us.
[00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:47.549]  He's reaching 100 million people a day with stuff you would say he's devastating them.
[00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.350]  You don't do that if you're with him.
[00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:56.235]  So, Elon Musk is definitely for real, because you can't argue with the results.
[00:09:56.736 --> 00:09:58.217]  That's just the way the universe works.
[00:09:58.237 --> 00:10:00.619]  This is being powered by X right now, I should just say.
[00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:01.320]  No, exactly.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.741]  And he's not censoring us.
[00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:05.003]  In fact, he's boosting us, probably.
[00:10:05.463 --> 00:10:07.265]  So the point is, by boosting, getting out of the way.
[00:10:08.377 --> 00:10:11.679]  So they've already lost the culture war.
[00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:13.801]  So you can just say, Musk, maybe he's an opportunist.
[00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.442]  He sees the old systems going down.
[00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:16.643]  He's shifting over.
[00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:18.164]  That's if he's a bad guy.
[00:10:18.204 --> 00:10:24.148]  If he's a good guy, he really cares about us and is a humanitarian and a bleeding heart for freedom and has joined us.
[00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:26.229]  But you can't argue with what he's done.
[00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:27.790]  But back to the violence.
[00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:32.173]  They have nothing they can do now but violence.
[00:10:32.774 --> 00:10:40.029]   And so we are entering that that wheelhouse. We are entering that zone where they're
[00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.620]   telling us we're violent, they're telling us we're evil, they're telling us we're
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.110]  white supremacists, we're not.
[00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.949]  And so it's obvious that that is about to basically unfold.
[00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:52.589]   But I want to tell the establishment, five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
[00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:57.459]   you'd stage a false flag or provocateur or something. It worked. It doesn't work on thinking people
[00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:05.828]   now, and it works on less people every day. So I would just advise the globalists to give up.
[00:11:05.828 --> 00:11:05.870]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:12.966]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:15.187]  It is Saturday, March 9th, 2024.
[00:11:15.887 --> 00:11:19.308]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:22.729]  We'll be here for at least the next two hours.
[00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.111]  And then I shall return tomorrow evening, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.552]  for the Sunday night transmission live.
[00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:32.431]  And then 11 a.m.
[00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:37.753]  Central on Monday for the weekday transmission.
[00:11:37.773 --> 00:11:57.719]  Thank you for watching us at InfoWars.com forward slash show and listening on radio stations across the country and some TV stations and cable stations and of course at Real Alex Jones on X. And if you're tuned in there right now, remember this is listener participation in the InfoWar with 240 days, 11 hours, 47 minutes, 54 seconds out.
[00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:00.180]  The most important election in world history.
[00:12:01.263 --> 00:12:04.265]  Be active or become radioactive in nuclear war.
[00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:11.250]  And it just goes downhill from there, but freedom is popular and that is the good news.
[00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:11.730]  Okay.
[00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:19.775]  I normally take off at least part of Saturday, but I guess about half the time I do a special Saturday show, but sometimes I take off.
[00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:29.242]   But I was out of town in Florida, not just visiting with Tucker and doing his show and Reaching at least 20 million people on there so far.
[00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:30.003]  Very successful.
[00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:31.323]  They were very pleased.
[00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:33.164]  It was an amazing broadcast.
[00:12:33.945 --> 00:12:36.206]  He's a historian guest and Cutter's monologue.
[00:12:36.226 --> 00:12:37.006]  I was honored to be there.
[00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:40.208]  Got some stories I'm going to tell about that.
[00:12:40.288 --> 00:12:46.152]  Obviously, we have the aftermath of the state of the angry meth head Biden.
[00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:52.713]  Dottering around, we have Trump sweeping Super Tuesday in the aftermath of that.
[00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:57.416]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us from the road.
[00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:12.846]  He's driving to speak to a big Republican group in Florida, but he'll be joining us in the second hour to cover the waterfront, all the big developments and issues and what Trump's thinking and what the next hurdles are and what the enemy's going to throw at us.
[00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:16.769]  That is all coming up today and so much more.
[00:13:17.602 --> 00:13:25.507]  And there have been a lot of really illustrative events that have happened that really have gotten people's attention.
[00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:28.389]  So not even looking for it.
[00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:36.094]  I've been sent so many clips by friends, family, you name it, and I've run across it being online everywhere.
[00:13:37.615 --> 00:13:42.778]  Bernie Sanders coming into the State of the Union and walking around for over an hour shaking people's hands with no mask on.
[00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:56.110]  Shaking people's hands and rubbing his face, and then as soon as he gets ready to sit down and know that he'll be on television for sure, he puts the mask on.
[00:13:56.951 --> 00:14:12.637]   Now, we all know it's Kabuki theater, but three years ago, four years ago, when they were doing all this theater, we would point out the videos where you see the politician off the side Not wearing a mask, but before they would get on the stage, they'd put the mask on.
[00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:24.386]  And a lot of videos got caught in the UK and Canada, even the US, of these globalist minions, these WEF operatives, saying, hey, everybody, we got to put our mask on once we go on stage.
[00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:26.487]  So they would say that off the side.
[00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:28.809]  And that's emblematic of everything they do.
[00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:29.750]  So we've got that.
[00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:37.755]  We've got a really important story that ties into the New World Order's master plan that is so key that I'm going to hit first.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:15:00.678]  And that's putting National Guard, a thousand of them, in the New York subway because it's become a completely lawless, feces, rat, needle-infested hellhole, where it's true, white people, hundreds of times a week that we know of, are brutally beaten and attacked or murdered because of what color they are.
[00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:10.254]   And now the troops are being deployed and searching everyone's bags Without a warrant.
[00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:15.337]  So if you understand this story, you understand everything.
[00:15:15.357 --> 00:15:21.159]  So I'm going to get to that and really do the deep dive on it here in just a moment.
[00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:25.201]  Because if you understand this story, you understand everything.
[00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:27.802]  And I love Rosetta Stone stories.
[00:15:28.923 --> 00:15:35.528]   Of course they couldn't decipher a lot of the Egyptian hieroglyphs because they didn't know what they meant.
[00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:38.511]  Some were, on their face, obvious what they were.
[00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:43.255]  A hieroglyph of a hippopotamus or a hieroglyph of a snake or the sun.
[00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:47.799]  But a lot of them, they couldn't know what they symbolized and couldn't read it.
[00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:55.786]  And then they found the Rosetta Stone a few hundred years ago that was the decoder of it into another language.
[00:15:56.972 --> 00:16:01.534]  So because we have that other language, we could then now decode the hieroglyphs.
[00:16:02.214 --> 00:16:07.036]  So I call stories like this a Rosetta Stone.
[00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:29.259]   And if you understand what they're doing in blue states and the capitals of the testing grounds are New York City and places like Los Angeles, California and Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan, and many others.
[00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:32.882]  Once you understand that, then you understand the master plan.
[00:16:33.603 --> 00:16:46.034]  And instead of us just going through life like automatons, like we're in the film Metropolis, we can actually be humans and control our environment and make these important decisions.
[00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:50.258]  So we have that as well.
[00:16:53.717 --> 00:16:58.260]  Now there's another big story I'm going to get to, and that's Trump.
[00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:08.847]  And he, for a while, like a turtle pulling his head back in to the shell, was not promoting the deadly shots or saying it was a success.
[00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:19.575]  He was doing it for a while, but he got booed at his rallies doing it, so he was smart enough, even though he's very bullish and very pig-headed, which is a positive thing, and the globalists can't bend him.
[00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:24.067]  But once he thinks something's good, he won't admit it to himself.
[00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:26.309]  He doubles down.
[00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.170]  Well, he's done it again and it's disgusting.
[00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:32.233]  That doesn't mean I don't support him, but I'm also not a cult.
[00:17:33.274 --> 00:17:35.176]  We elected Trump twice already.
[00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:38.178]  Then they stole the election in 2020.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.202]  And so we need to hold his feet to the fire.
[00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:51.302]   When he is reelected in a landslide this coming November.
[00:17:52.622 --> 00:17:54.423]  I said, I love Trump, but this is BS.
[00:17:55.363 --> 00:17:57.663]  The so-called vaccine is a biological weapon.
[00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:02.625]  Good news is people are awake and not even 45 can sell it.
[00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:13.087]  And that tweet at Real Alex Jones got 2.2 million views, but it got copied everywhere.
[00:18:13.147 --> 00:18:14.267]  I saw one version.
[00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:15.667]  Somebody copied my quote.
[00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:17.188]  It had 24 million views.
[00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:22.635]  Yes, we are the new media.
[00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.357]  The globalist media is the dinosaur media.
[00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:35.103]  They are extinct, but they're trying to claw us back into hell with them.
[00:18:36.524 --> 00:18:49.333]  So I'm about to cover the Rosetta Stone story of troops in the New York subway and what that signifies and what that means.
[00:18:49.393 --> 00:19:16.547]   And it's going to take me probably 15 minutes to do this, but I'm asking you to watch it all, to take notes, and to then share the clip once we cut it out from the live show today and post it at Band.Video and at InfoWars.com and on X at Real Alex Jones, because all these decades of preparation for martial law, and that's what this is, is here.
[00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:27.127]  But they have to create the climate first for martial law and civil emergency to sell us on it, the angrier world that Klaus Schwab talks about.
[00:19:27.187 --> 00:19:37.117]  So I'm going to air an esoteric report that Greg Reese has done that I don't want to say I disagree with it.
[00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:38.298]  I just don't.
[00:19:40.063 --> 00:19:41.204]  Put a lot of stock in it.
[00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:42.946]  And I like Greg Reese.
[00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:44.067]  I respect him, love him.
[00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:47.150]  So because of that, he has free reign.
[00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.130]  He puts out whatever he wants.
[00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:51.093]  And I agree with about 95% of what Greg says.
[00:19:52.454 --> 00:19:56.598]  But I think this report's important because this is how the Illuminati thinks.
[00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:59.081]  And I'm not saying Greg's the Illuminati.
[00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:00.782]  He just might have made that point.
[00:20:01.503 --> 00:20:09.174]   Because whether you believe what you're about to see about remote viewing or not, And we all know, anybody who's experienced life, psychic powers are real.
[00:20:09.895 --> 00:20:18.401]  I found they're very uncontrollable and very spirit-centered, and you'd call that subconscious, unconscious.
[00:20:19.822 --> 00:20:27.488]  But this is what the globalists believe, and they are out promoting that there's about to be a rapture, but it's an anti-Christian rapture.
[00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:40.600]   So whether this is real or not, and I don't think there's a non-Christian rapture, the globalists are promoting this because they want to Potentially, if something like this happens, have an excuse for why it went down.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.460]  So I'm not criticizing Greg's report.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.401]  I'm just saying he tries to make them five minutes so they fit on the show.
[00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.181]  I guess I've kind of asked for that.
[00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:49.802]  I said he could make longer ones if you want.
[00:20:50.322 --> 00:20:56.703]  It's just that I'm trying to fill in the blanks here of my view on the thought provoking things that he said.
[00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:57.883]  So we're going to air that report.
[00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:01.744]  And I'm going to focus my mind and come back with this.
[00:21:04.028 --> 00:21:09.296]  Incredible situation that we're dealing with, with the troops in the New York subway.
[00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:13.862]  So here it is, remote viewing of the Rapture Ascension event.
[00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:16.306]  You'll find it at man.video.
[00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:25.386]  Here it is.
[00:21:25.386 --> 00:21:29.706]   Viewing is the military term for viewing a target with the mind's eye.
[00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:38.462]  Remote viewings are conducted under double blind conditions, meaning that the target assigner and the viewers are unaware of what they are viewing.
[00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:41.085]  They are simply given an arbitrary number.
[00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:48.795]  The Future Forecasting Group was recently given the target number H506B3T9.
[00:21:49.395 --> 00:21:51.217]  That was the only information they had.
[00:21:51.877 --> 00:21:55.120]  It was only after the viewing that they learned what the target was.
[00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:57.142]  Drumroll please!
[00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:00.244]  You guys were looking at the Rapture?
[00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:04.148]  The global religious event of an unknown time.
[00:22:04.867 --> 00:22:07.449]  The target was the split rapture event.
[00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:15.436]  In Christianity, it is the rapture when believers are taken into heaven while the rest of humanity suffers the tribulation.
[00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:30.829]  The raw material calls this event the harvest and says it happens every 25,000 years when those who have spiritually evolved ascend to a higher dimension while those who don't are reincarnated back into the third dimension.
[00:22:31.793 --> 00:22:36.237]  According to Christians who believe in it, to be raptured you must believe in Christ.
[00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:54.011]  The raw material is from an exhaustive channeling experiment that took decades to achieve, and the source claims to be a group of entities known as the Council of Nine, or Ra, the same Ra of ancient Egypt, here to assist mankind in their spiritual evolution.
[00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:58.095]  And the FFG team saw all of this in their viewing.
[00:22:59.369 --> 00:23:10.933]  To see if they are all getting the same data, remote viewers work in teams and they all saw the event spanning from what was described as ancient Egypt or the Middle East into the present day.
[00:23:11.293 --> 00:23:16.835]  They saw an event that required one's loyal submission or worship to higher beings.
[00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:19.695]  They saw a major event happening in the heavens.
[00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:26.398]  They saw what appeared to be a major cataclysmic event tied to the great year of roughly 25,000 years.
[00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:31.959]  Something that many researchers predict and the raw material confirms.
[00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:35.760]  And they all saw non-human entities behind this event.
[00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:43.503]  Riordan even saw a council of nine and a blue bird, which is how they described themselves in the raw material.
[00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:50.765]  They saw what appeared to be another planet, one with an inhospitable atmosphere that required domed cities.
[00:23:51.506 --> 00:23:55.787]  They saw underground bases and they saw the infamous grey aliens.
[00:23:57.632 --> 00:24:00.496]  And then we're seeing one of these guys again.
[00:24:01.277 --> 00:24:02.859]  Continuation of a species.
[00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.506]  They gotta do what they gotta do.
[00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:06.967]  No regrets.
[00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.248]  But the sense is like, help us.
[00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:10.269]  Like, they need our help.
[00:24:10.829 --> 00:24:16.953]  Again, this idea of like a manifest destiny to inhabit a corporeal being.
[00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:28.621]  According to UFO research, the most common story is that the Greys destroyed their own planet and came to Earth to experiment on mankind in a desperate attempt for survival.
[00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:38.048]  No longer able to reproduce sexually, they experiment on mankind with genetic science and technology to sustain their own species.
[00:24:38.849 --> 00:24:43.333]  And according to the raw material, there are two factions of non-humans on Earth.
[00:24:43.913 --> 00:24:56.003]  One is on the path of service to others, here to help humanity spiritually liberate itself, and the other is on the path of service to self, here to enslave humanity for their own selfish needs.
[00:24:56.844 --> 00:25:07.753]  Allgaier saw several images of how the soul is attached to the human body, how it is removed, and how these creatures were attempting to manipulate the process with a neural link.
[00:25:08.213 --> 00:25:24.927]  And practically the whole team saw barbaric experiments on mankind with brain chips, animal mutilations, animal-human hybrids, and transhumanist hardware, as if creating some sort of human Frankenstein was the only way for their species to survive.
[00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:37.716]  They could be viewing the Biblical Mark of the Beast and also the Orion Group from the raw material, otherwise known as the Greys, who seek to use humanity for their own selfish needs.
[00:25:38.116 --> 00:25:42.480]  They saw UFOs, major events in the sky, and a mass exodus.
[00:25:43.536 --> 00:25:50.038]  It is interesting to note that Elon Musk wants to give everyone brain implants and says we need to escape the planet.
[00:25:50.458 --> 00:26:01.021]  President Trump created Space Force and a year later former Israeli Space Chief Chaim Eshed said that extraterrestrials exist and Trump knows about it.
[00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:13.647]  It is also important to note that I am seeing their remote viewing through my own filter, but you can watch the full presentation for yourself and draw your own conclusions at futureforecastinggroup.com.
[00:26:14.387 --> 00:26:18.387]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:26:18.387 --> 00:26:43.387]  [Music]
[00:26:43.752 --> 00:26:50.752]  It's Saturday, March 9, 2024.
[00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:53.752]  Now, I am an expert on the police state.
[00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:54.635]  I've written books on it.
[00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:55.935]  I've made five films on it.
[00:26:57.495 --> 00:27:07.737]  And when I was cutting my teeth 29 years ago on air, Bill Clinton had just been in office for a year or so, and it was confirmed.
[00:27:07.777 --> 00:27:08.877]  The military was warning.
[00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:10.178]  It was coming out.
[00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:12.018]  They were leaking classified documents.
[00:27:13.766 --> 00:27:24.772]  That now are all basically admitted and have been publicly rolled out against the public to incrementally bring in martial law.
[00:27:25.672 --> 00:27:26.973]  And what does martial law mean?
[00:27:27.013 --> 00:27:31.555]  The suspension of normal due process and military rule.
[00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:35.097]  That means those that control the military rule.
[00:27:36.198 --> 00:27:38.799]  So it's a coup over the people, a coup over freedom.
[00:27:40.390 --> 00:28:04.762]  So if you look at the Great Reset and the Globalist program worldwide, they'll come in and create racial or cultural division, they'll cut off resources to create rioting, they'll also cut off police funding so that crime gets out of control, so many of the small businesses and shops get attacked that most of them close, and it creates a real desperation, or what Klaus Schwab calls an angrier world.
[00:28:07.443 --> 00:28:12.382]   So the border's wide open, And children are being smuggled across and put in sex slavery.
[00:28:13.222 --> 00:28:13.923]  That's all admitted.
[00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:31.454]  But then when you try to fly on an airplane, or more and more try to get on a bus or a subway, the military is there searching you.
[00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:48.165]   And back when Clinton was in office, even before they set up the TSA, In the airports, they would have the TSA, the Transportation Department, do drills that we caught on tape in Texas.
[00:28:48.325 --> 00:28:49.606]  People would call us, we'd drive the scene.
[00:28:50.086 --> 00:29:00.988]  You'd have a hundred military or so, with the state police, on a highway, randomly diverting cars off onto the access road, and searching people.
[00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:06.270]  And it's in one of my Police State films, I think Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:07.530]  That's the one.
[00:29:08.712 --> 00:29:11.233]  We get the call, it's happening north of Austin in the Temple.
[00:29:11.853 --> 00:29:14.595]  My producer at the time, camera guy, gets in his car, drives up there.
[00:29:15.715 --> 00:29:19.217]  And they've got the military pulling over cars and buses and things, searching them.
[00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:26.500]  And Mike walks up and asks, it's on video, we have the video on the film, what's happening?
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.020]  Is there a bomb?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.801]  Are you looking for terrorists?
[00:29:27.861 --> 00:29:29.442]  And they said, no, talk to the FBI.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:39.488]  An FBI black car pulls up, FBI agent gets out and says this is a drill from Fort Hood with the Transportation Department and we're authorizing their law to do it.
[00:29:39.748 --> 00:29:41.009]  And then he gets back in the car and leaves.
[00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.233]  And then it turned out that document was marked restricted.
[00:29:46.254 --> 00:29:46.934]  It's all on video!
[00:29:50.417 --> 00:29:52.739]  So I've been focused on this for a long time.
[00:29:52.759 --> 00:30:07.015]   The reason I raised that going back to the beginning of my research of this is I was trying to puzzle, why are they having training events with sheriff's departments in big counties, small counties, police forces, in small cities, big cities?
[00:30:08.816 --> 00:30:17.499]  Why is this happening in Wisconsin, in Texas, in Florida, in New York, California, every state, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Michigan?
[00:30:19.824 --> 00:30:29.450]  And they'd have military drills, or the military taking over the city council, or the military taking over the capital, and black helicopters would come in and detonate simulant explosives.
[00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.011]  They weren't huge bombs, but boom, big explosions.
[00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:37.175]  There'd be men rappelling down, and then local media wouldn't cover it, but locals would get video.
[00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:40.416]  And then we would cover it.
[00:30:42.138 --> 00:30:45.900]  And they'd have national stories saying, Alex Jones is insane, there are no black helicopters.
[00:30:46.755 --> 00:30:48.736]  So we're going back 29, 28 years.
[00:30:48.776 --> 00:30:52.038]  When I'm first on air for a few years, it'll be 30 years in April.
[00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.360]  And so I said, what's going on?
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:02.444]  Well, then there was a 29 Palms survey with the Marines fire on American citizens to take our guns that got leaked and was confirmed to be real.
[00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:07.648]  So we didn't know if Bill Clinton was about to try that or not.
[00:31:09.949 --> 00:31:11.230]  But I thought it was very interesting.
[00:31:12.264 --> 00:31:13.584]  And the listeners were very interested.
[00:31:14.364 --> 00:31:24.227]  And so I would say a third of what I covered on air on my local TV show and my syndicated radio show that started out as a local show was this.
[00:31:25.647 --> 00:31:35.630]  And we even went out and we got tips and would catch the black helicopter drills where they would lease a building that was about to be destroyed in San Antonio or many other areas.
[00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.130]  And we get a tip from police that were concerned too.
[00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:48.197]   They'd say, Hey, Saturday night at midnight Delta forces coming in, they're going to Do a big drill and take over this building and we would show up and get it on video.
[00:31:48.658 --> 00:31:50.480]  Once in San Antonio, they sent up U.S.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:56.125]  Army with 45s and they pull them out and point them at us and say, give us that tape.
[00:31:57.246 --> 00:31:58.967]  And back then it was a tape in the camera.
[00:32:00.068 --> 00:32:00.789]  We gave them the tape.
[00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.430]  They erased the tape.
[00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:05.033]  They gave it back to us and said, get out of here.
[00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:07.255]  This is in downtown San Antonio.
[00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.611]  So obviously when you got U.S.
[00:32:11.772 --> 00:32:20.138]  Army pointing .45s at you, 9mm Berettas or whatever they were, I remember the gun, it was a .45.
[00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:24.801]  When you've got that going on, you start saying, what the hell's going on?
[00:32:25.562 --> 00:32:28.104]  So back then I'm like, well, are they planning for martial law?
[00:32:28.144 --> 00:32:28.604]  They were, they were.
[00:32:28.624 --> 00:32:34.829]  I mean, of course, later all the local newscasts, oh, we're training to fight the militia and the right wingers, the constitutional terrorists.
[00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:45.565]  So they went from this being secret under Clinton, and then with Bush, yeah, it's mainly for Al Qaeda, but it's also for domestic groups.
[00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:52.430]  And then you're asking, well, what's this really all about?
[00:32:54.411 --> 00:33:02.016]  And then you start to realize it's part of a long-term process of just getting the military, the police, the public ready for this.
[00:33:04.078 --> 00:33:05.719]  So here's what's happening.
[00:33:07.233 --> 00:33:17.701]  We're not going to have UN troops one day, or Russian troops like Red Dawn, and you're in Colorado, and all of a sudden parachutes come down and you've got Russian troops shooting at you.
[00:33:20.984 --> 00:33:27.910]  It'll be our own troops, but they'll be made up of people that have been tested for decades, going through the training, going along with attacking their own people.
[00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.954]  There'll be a lot of foreigners and illegals that make up the military, which is now happening publicly.
[00:33:32.974 --> 00:33:35.536]  I'll show you a bunch of articles in a moment, in case you've been hiding under a rock.
[00:33:37.486 --> 00:33:39.748]  The police more and more being made up of illegal aliens.
[00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:43.410]  I remember 10 years ago, New Mexico legalized hiring illegal aliens as police.
[00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:46.472]  No one believed it when I was reading AP articles about it.
[00:33:46.512 --> 00:33:47.953]  There's no way they're hiring illegals.
[00:33:48.014 --> 00:33:48.754]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:50.035]  You're like, okay, yeah, it's happening.
[00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:57.620]  So the UN troops come in our own uniform, but they're trained by NGOs.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.961]  They're trained by UN doctrine.
[00:33:59.762 --> 00:34:00.863]  It's a State Department memorandum 7277.
[00:34:01.483 --> 00:34:04.986]  And remember, everything I say, you can write notes and search it.
[00:34:05.623 --> 00:34:06.363]  So I'm moving quick here.
[00:34:06.863 --> 00:34:09.164]  Everything I've said in the last five minutes, you just search.
[00:34:09.284 --> 00:34:10.484]  Anything I said, you'll pull it up.
[00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:12.144]  I didn't tell the crew what to pull up.
[00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:15.545]  I dealt the force doing drills of taking over U.S.
[00:34:15.605 --> 00:34:15.885]  cities.
[00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:17.345]  They were just searching it.
[00:34:17.385 --> 00:34:18.965]  They pulled up local newscasts around the country.
[00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:20.285]  Okay?
[00:34:21.026 --> 00:34:21.726]  You can do this too.
[00:34:22.466 --> 00:34:25.346]  Everything I say, State Department Memorandum 7277.
[00:34:26.547 --> 00:34:28.487]  Anything I say, write it down.
[00:34:29.147 --> 00:34:31.767]  Decide what you want to investigate, because the rabbit hole goes on forever.
[00:34:33.408 --> 00:34:42.647]   So there's this massive Right beneath the surface, program, and we get the training manuals, because the police leak them to us, and the government confirms it.
[00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:46.027]  And we broke the MIAC report, now like 14 years ago.
[00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:56.830]  And the FBI, where the military was training to confiscate guns, and the Libertarians, the main enemy, and Alex Jones, and Ron Paul, and, well, there were big state investigations about it.
[00:34:57.981 --> 00:35:00.802]  But see, that was all secret then, now it's out in the open.
[00:35:00.842 --> 00:35:10.844]  Joe Biden's like, yeah, MAGA are terrorists, and our official number one threat's white supremacists, and we define white supremacists as anybody that disagrees with martial law, basically.
[00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:25.668]  So your borders are wide open, but you yourself are treated like a total slave and have no due process.
[00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:31.181]  And so anytime I criticize the TSA, people say, well, you know, the TSA was set up for 9-11.
[00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:32.041]  No, it wasn't.
[00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:32.902]  They already had it ready.
[00:35:32.922 --> 00:35:34.063]  They used 9-11 as the pretext.
[00:35:34.423 --> 00:35:45.050]  And I always told you, this was in the documents, they were going to expand the TSA to highways, buses, terminals, trains.
[00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:47.691]  Not the border.
[00:35:49.472 --> 00:36:00.261]   And then we saw countless examples under Obama Even in Austin, we didn't have to go anywhere, we got a call, hey, TSA's down here at the train station searching everybody.
[00:36:00.321 --> 00:36:03.084]  We go down there and they say, get back, get back, and they're searching everyone.
[00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:07.347]  So this was all training and normalization of this.
[00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:09.509]  The angrier world.
[00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:17.135]  So they defund your local police, they bring in, it's not 10 million, 20 plus million illegal aliens, mainly military age men.
[00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:32.454]  Then we learned they're training all the preachers that will sign on for the clergy response teams that when martial law comes, they will tell you it's of God, turn your guns in.
[00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:38.315]  And they'll also be talking to their parishioners and reporting it back to the military.
[00:36:39.235 --> 00:36:42.655]  And that gets into Jade Helm, which was a total martial law takeover drill.
[00:36:43.316 --> 00:36:45.576]  We weren't seeing Jade Helm seven, eight years ago.
[00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:52.689]  It was a takeover, we said it was a drill for a takeover.
[00:36:55.111 --> 00:37:06.900]  So they get rid of our police and military, they transfer it over to multinational forces, but they first munialize by mixing the foreigners into the police and military to normalize it.
[00:37:09.281 --> 00:37:12.664]  So we've got decades of preparation, decades of training.
[00:37:13.938 --> 00:37:17.938]   and them keeping it secret. Then they begin to admit what they're doing. Then they become
[00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:23.697]   to go operational. Then they defund police. Then they give billions of dollars, the government has,
[00:37:23.697 --> 00:37:28.018]   to Black Lives Matter, not just NGOs. And they start burning everything down.
[00:37:28.018 --> 00:37:32.258]   And so they're getting ready for the big event where they're going to trigger
[00:37:32.258 --> 00:37:39.297]   a globalist insurrection in America that they're going to call a patriot insurrection.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:38:00.284]  So they'll have provocateurs on the right-wing populist side, and they'll have all their big NGOs in Hezbollah and Hamas and Black Lives Matter and Antifa on the other side, and a lot of them posing as us to start burning buildings, killing people, sabotaging things, to create so much hysteria and fear, then the military has to come out.
[00:38:02.145 --> 00:38:15.637]  They're planning currently, doesn't mean they'll pull the trigger, but it's being pre-programmed right now, that if Trump wins in eight and a half months, they will then activate the leftist groups to burn down the country.
[00:38:16.738 --> 00:38:24.064]  But to legitimize that that's okay, they'll have some right-wing supposed terrorists stage some events, truck bombs, mass shootings.
[00:38:24.525 --> 00:38:24.985]  Think about it.
[00:38:25.946 --> 00:38:27.848]  It's all on the drawing board, but now it's going operational.
[00:38:29.485 --> 00:38:39.949]  That will then be used to call it a giant clash of civilizations or a civil war, and then Trump, who is president-elect, will be blamed for it.
[00:38:41.289 --> 00:39:05.601]   And they plan to have so much destabilization and hysteria after Trump is elected, but in the two months before he gets into office, on January 20th, 2025, That them in that fog of war, they're able to assassinate him or arrest him.
[00:39:07.003 --> 00:39:09.266]  The point is, they know we're awake.
[00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.127]  They know we're winning.
[00:39:10.167 --> 00:39:11.008]  They're about to make their move.
[00:39:12.403 --> 00:39:31.876]  So they were building this option for martial law the whole time and preparing and normalizing it where you see troops on the street, you see gun confiscation, and you see the clergy response teams during Katrina helping take the guns, and old man doesn't turn his guns in so they kill him, and old woman won't turn in her revolver so they beat her up on camera.
[00:39:32.277 --> 00:39:33.117]  That's in all my films.
[00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:36.980]  Police State 1, Police State 2, Police State 3, Police State 4.
[00:39:39.602 --> 00:39:40.382]  Pretty important films.
[00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:54.202]  Next week on X, we'll re-upload all the police state films to X because this was the globalist building in their failsafe the whole time.
[00:39:56.705 --> 00:39:58.688]  So now that leads us to where we are today.
[00:40:01.203 --> 00:40:07.929]  Defund the police, cut back their numbers, have DAs that won't prosecute people that rape, that rob.
[00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.153]  They even release shooters that shoot people if they're not white.
[00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:21.441]  If you are white and you're under attack and you defend yourself, they throw the book at you because they're creating the battle line because whites are now the minority.
[00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:27.867]  They want to make it a racial clash when really it's BlackRock and the globalists and all the big money coming in.
[00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:38.740]  So it's not a civil war, it's a globalist coup against the people that they will brand as a race war.
[00:40:40.381 --> 00:40:40.961]  Comprende?
[00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:42.741]  Now you're understanding.
[00:40:45.322 --> 00:41:02.995]   So, New York is incredibly dangerous, trash everywhere, rats everywhere, it's totally turned into hell, the subway is extremely dangerous, and then they've brought in Probably a million illegals in New York.
[00:41:03.055 --> 00:41:05.136]  It's not 10 million nationwide, it's 20-something million.
[00:41:05.756 --> 00:41:08.817]  So hundreds of thousands, bare minimum, have been brought in, mainly military age men.
[00:41:09.277 --> 00:41:11.158]  They're giving them driver's licenses, they're letting them vote.
[00:41:11.978 --> 00:41:16.580]  The mayor will criticize it with one side of his mouth, the other side asks for federal funding for it.
[00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:20.622]  They're kicking veterans out of nursing homes and putting illegals in them.
[00:41:21.743 --> 00:41:33.351]   And then Hochul comes out and says, I'm putting a thousand National Guard in the subways To search everybody's bags and do all this.
[00:41:33.792 --> 00:41:39.176]  And again, that's just training you for the normalization of the martial law.
[00:41:40.076 --> 00:41:41.978]  And then it's, oh, sorry, you can't get on the subway.
[00:41:42.358 --> 00:41:43.639]  You haven't taken the vaccine.
[00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:51.785]  You don't have the digital pass, the smartphone, but first they got to make you go through all this and be searched.
[00:41:53.789 --> 00:42:02.873]  So that you'll accept the Global ID, you'll accept the Central Bank Digital Currency app on your phone, and then the troops will wave you right through.
[00:42:06.915 --> 00:42:07.576]  Let them work!
[00:42:07.636 --> 00:42:09.797]  Hoechlin pressures Biden over New York's migrant surge.
[00:42:10.197 --> 00:42:17.200]  In a live stream address, the Democrat governor sought to redouble our efforts to address the 100,000 asylum seekers who have come to New York over the past year.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.081]  Yeah, it's way closer to a million.
[00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.435]  So here's what's happening.
[00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:29.099]  They're going from preparation and wargaming and testing all of this to operational now.
[00:42:31.981 --> 00:42:40.626]  And now they're suspending due process and the Bill of Rights for your safety.
[00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:45.473]  Because they won't prosecute any of the criminals who now think they've got to get out of jail free card.
[00:42:45.893 --> 00:42:49.836]  And then now they come as the savior where all of you lose your rights.
[00:42:50.577 --> 00:42:51.737]  So the border's wide open.
[00:42:51.757 --> 00:42:53.159]  They're bringing in tens of millions of people.
[00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:55.981]  But you're searched the airport.
[00:42:56.021 --> 00:42:57.121]  You're put in a body scanner.
[00:42:57.262 --> 00:42:58.322]  Your testicles are grubbed.
[00:42:58.622 --> 00:42:59.843]  Your wife's breasts are grabbed.
[00:43:01.124 --> 00:43:04.367]  All your children are trained to be humiliated and be prisoners.
[00:43:05.452 --> 00:43:11.596]  Because if you're raised in a non-criminal family, you've not been to jail or you've never had your rights trampled on.
[00:43:12.296 --> 00:43:15.818]  But see, you're still being given prison induction training.
[00:43:16.299 --> 00:43:19.240]  They built all the emergency COVID camps around the Western world.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.382]  They're all the same design, same setup.
[00:43:21.862 --> 00:43:27.986]  But now they say, oh, during the next virus, we're going to lock up anybody that criticizes the policy because we've got to save you.
[00:43:29.727 --> 00:43:32.333]   So again, Will it be war?
[00:43:32.533 --> 00:43:33.574]  Will it be a bioweapon?
[00:43:34.374 --> 00:43:35.795]  Will it be the dollar collapsing?
[00:43:35.835 --> 00:43:37.375]  What will be the trigger for martial law?
[00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.596]  We're not sure.
[00:43:39.656 --> 00:43:40.537]  They've been testing it all.
[00:43:40.637 --> 00:43:52.042]  But they are absolutely getting ready for full bore martial law and beta testing it now before they go fully operational in New York.
[00:43:54.683 --> 00:43:55.523]  They open the borders.
[00:43:55.603 --> 00:43:56.523]  They bring in the illegals.
[00:43:56.944 --> 00:43:57.904]  They defund the police.
[00:43:58.024 --> 00:43:59.985]  The prosecutors let the violent criminals out.
[00:44:01.212 --> 00:44:10.718]  And then they put military on the streets searching you and put it on television and defend it.
[00:44:11.419 --> 00:44:19.584]  Just like Hochul when she'd been appointed after they removed Cuomo said in bizarre clips, this is a new religion.
[00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:22.986]  Do what we say, take the shot, wear the mask.
[00:44:24.887 --> 00:44:26.588]  And so now they've got the handcuffs out.
[00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:28.770]  They're saying just put these on, we'll be much nicer to you.
[00:44:29.636 --> 00:44:35.300]  So they're getting ready for the next big crisis event that will be the pretext for the martial law.
[00:44:37.221 --> 00:44:39.323]  A subway plan aimed to ease fears.
[00:44:39.663 --> 00:44:41.284]  The blowback was immediate.
[00:44:41.404 --> 00:44:42.124]  New York Times.
[00:44:43.786 --> 00:44:45.967]  New York is expanding bag checks on the subway.
[00:44:46.247 --> 00:44:47.288]  How is this legal?
[00:44:47.328 --> 00:44:47.948]  London Guardian.
[00:44:51.411 --> 00:44:54.433]  New York subway violence continues after Hochul deploys National Guard.
[00:44:58.993 --> 00:45:05.055]  Meanwhile, you've got San Francisco appoints first non-citizen to sit on the city's elections commission.
[00:45:05.415 --> 00:45:06.615]  She's only been in the U.S.
[00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:07.535]  since 2019.
[00:45:08.336 --> 00:45:12.297]  They're normalizing foreign men in the military and police.
[00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:16.518]  They're normalizing foreigners on the boards that run the policy.
[00:45:17.238 --> 00:45:26.961]  They're normalizing the foreign troops and the troops and our domestic troops that are going to be mainly foreign troops right now.
[00:45:28.063 --> 00:45:31.947]  They're leaving beta, going into operational.
[00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:41.697]  So our 30 years on air in April has all been leading towards this.
[00:45:42.578 --> 00:45:50.466]  Because if you see military doing gun confiscation drills, and then you get documents they're doing it, and years later they go, of course we're practicing to take your guns.
[00:45:51.414 --> 00:45:52.955]  You think about, well, that'll explode.
[00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:55.557]  But on top of it, they're going to cut the power.
[00:45:55.877 --> 00:45:57.058]  They're going to have cyber attacks.
[00:45:57.358 --> 00:46:00.841]  They're going to be doing domestic terror attacks that they blame on us.
[00:46:01.001 --> 00:46:08.267]  And they believe most the men during this will go ahead and just turn the guns in because you won't have food.
[00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:19.775]  See, people should be storing more water filters and food and have people you can trust and work with than just having 100 guns.
[00:46:22.332 --> 00:46:25.334]  You should have three or four guns and a bunch of ammunition.
[00:46:26.195 --> 00:46:29.578]  But people have way more guns than they have ammunition.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.743]  But we don't want to go to that point, but the globalists have lost.
[00:46:37.444 --> 00:46:38.745]  And I use the analogy all the time.
[00:46:38.785 --> 00:46:41.247]  It's like the first Terminator movie where Skynet's lost.
[00:46:42.449 --> 00:46:54.254]  They've been blown up the future, but they got one laboratory and one time machine left, and they can send one Terminator back to try to kill the leader of the resistance so that they don't get defeated.
[00:46:57.455 --> 00:47:00.116]  The New World Order has already lost, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:23.450]  So all they can do now is cut the power, cut the resources, create so much discordant hysteria and destabilization that people roll over and say, I'll do whatever you say, just send me a bag of rice and I will do whatever you say.
[00:47:25.512 --> 00:47:30.056]  Just send me a carton or a box of dehydrated milk because my baby needs food.
[00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:34.227]  And that's why they're cutting the resources off.
[00:47:34.288 --> 00:47:35.769]  That's why they're cutting the fertilizer off.
[00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:37.730]  That's why they're maxing the dollar out.
[00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:41.233]  That's why they've created more money in three and a half years than ever created before.
[00:47:41.753 --> 00:47:42.874]  Because this is the big event.
[00:47:44.295 --> 00:47:50.540]  And that's why they've got the globalists behind the scenes trying to take the show off the air.
[00:47:54.903 --> 00:48:03.070]   That's why they've got all their little mercenary minions Ready for this because they know their time is over.
[00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:09.336]  And so they're going to come down with both feet on top of us and try to force us into this.
[00:48:09.376 --> 00:48:19.046]  But this is a big deal that New York has put a thousand troops in the subway to search everybody.
[00:48:19.086 --> 00:48:22.009]  And the governor said, if you don't like it, you don't go to work.
[00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:24.652]  But it's not going to be just search your bags.
[00:48:24.672 --> 00:48:28.053]  It's going to be show us your vaccine ID, show us your travel pass.
[00:48:28.073 --> 00:48:29.093]  They've already got set up and ready.
[00:48:29.513 --> 00:48:34.055]  Bill Gates, the UN, Australia's already got it, Europe's already bringing it in.
[00:48:34.755 --> 00:48:35.156]  We're here.
[00:48:36.716 --> 00:48:37.897]  Will it be a financial collapse?
[00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:38.917]  Will it be World War III?
[00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:40.397]  Will it be a viral release?
[00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:41.318]  Will it be all three?
[00:48:42.598 --> 00:48:49.021]  I don't know which one of their weapons they prepared and warmed up and gotten ready is going to be rolled out.
[00:48:49.909 --> 00:48:54.791]  But I know that they are trying to put the handcuffs on us right now.
[00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:57.952]  And we all know about serial killers.
[00:48:57.972 --> 00:49:04.114]  One of their favorite things is find a 15-year-old girl or something and put a gun to her head and just say, get in the van, I won't hurt you.
[00:49:04.694 --> 00:49:05.894]  You gotta run.
[00:49:05.954 --> 00:49:07.775]  He may still shoot you, but at least you're not gonna get tortured to death.
[00:49:08.255 --> 00:49:09.095]  You'll probably escape.
[00:49:10.616 --> 00:49:12.396]  He doesn't wanna shoot you in the parking lot and get caught.
[00:49:13.097 --> 00:49:14.157]  So just elbow him and run.
[00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:17.078]  But maybe you're scared and you don't listen, so you get in the van.
[00:49:18.234 --> 00:49:19.875]  Then he says, put these handcuffs on.
[00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:20.936]  I'm going to blow your head off.
[00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:22.477]  Jump out the door.
[00:49:25.039 --> 00:49:27.020]  Because you don't want to put the handcuffs on.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:34.125]  And he turns on a country road and says, okay, I'm not going to kill you.
[00:49:34.325 --> 00:49:34.925]  I'm gonna let you go.
[00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.847]  And he pulls out duct tape and hog ties you.
[00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.312]  And then he pulls up into a garage in the middle of nowhere.
[00:49:48.314 --> 00:49:54.496]  He comes up with a dolly, he picks you up, puts you on, he looks at you and he says, I'm going to rape and torture you for weeks.
[00:49:54.936 --> 00:49:56.037]  Prepare to die, bitch.
[00:49:57.957 --> 00:50:00.198]  So Hoechlin's got the electric tape out.
[00:50:01.979 --> 00:50:04.700]  And, oh, the military's here to save us.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.760]  They're not at the border.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.481]  Oh, no, we can't have them there.
[00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:09.141]  No, they're shipping the illegals there.
[00:50:10.762 --> 00:50:11.202]  No, no, no.
[00:50:11.482 --> 00:50:13.363]  In fact, they're making the military the illegals.
[00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:34.629]  And now because they simply greenlit crime and greenlit the breakdown of society, they think you're so stupid you can't put two and two together now that they're training you all to show your ID and have your bag searched because they're getting you ready probably for another viral release and something way worse.
[00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:39.270]  So I said I'd spend 20 minutes on that.
[00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:44.430]   I just spent like 40 minutes on it, 30 minutes on it, because it's a big deal, folks.
[00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:54.949]   So this system's coming in, and the more you submit to it,
[00:50:54.949 --> 00:50:57.449]  the more you will be enslaved.
[00:50:57.714 --> 00:51:03.476]  The globalists talk about us and call us feral animals that are eating their resources and outdoing all this.
[00:51:03.796 --> 00:51:06.556]  They don't want you to go to the movies or go to a concert or have fun.
[00:51:07.637 --> 00:51:09.637]  That was in the old days to distract you while they took over.
[00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:11.618]  They want to take all that away.
[00:51:11.998 --> 00:51:13.638]  They don't want you to be living.
[00:51:14.478 --> 00:51:16.999]  They want you off the planet they believe they've conquered.
[00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:26.576]  Now they did it through Bernie Madoff style fractional reserve banking and derivatives and things that would make Ponzi blush.
[00:51:29.118 --> 00:51:30.078]  But this is where we are.
[00:51:31.979 --> 00:51:34.941]  And big events are about to go down.
[00:51:35.982 --> 00:51:43.066]  The good news is a lot of people in the federal government and in corporations and local government know what's going on and are really freaked out.
[00:51:43.686 --> 00:51:47.348]  They're looking for leadership points and points where they can effectively counter this.
[00:51:48.868 --> 00:51:49.928]  The government's not our enemy.
[00:51:50.469 --> 00:51:55.230]  The government has been hijacked by these criminals and is making a move against society.
[00:51:56.891 --> 00:52:08.855]  But it's very apropos or poignant that after 30 years on air, we are now at this point and it's all going down.
[00:52:09.656 --> 00:52:17.679]  Everything's being compressed, time is accelerating, and all these new order operations are now being triggered.
[00:52:18.533 --> 00:52:21.854]  Because they knew their plan was horrible.
[00:52:21.914 --> 00:52:22.914]  They knew it would be unpopular.
[00:52:23.234 --> 00:52:24.875]  They knew they would need tyranny to get it through.
[00:52:25.895 --> 00:52:27.376]  But they thought you'd still be asleep.
[00:52:28.256 --> 00:52:32.617]  Instead, we're awake, you're awake, more people are awake every day.
[00:52:34.698 --> 00:52:36.599]  And their plan is not going to hunt.
[00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:38.559]  Their plan is not going to fly.
[00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:41.100]  Their plan is not going to work.
[00:52:43.564 --> 00:52:49.166]  But it could potentially very easily trigger wars and civil unrest that will destroy the planet.
[00:52:49.806 --> 00:52:53.687]  All these globalists are on record building bunkers in the middle of nowhere.
[00:52:54.347 --> 00:52:56.107]  Everybody's already marked those numbers down.
[00:52:56.148 --> 00:52:58.408]  If things collapse, that's where you go get resources.
[00:52:58.728 --> 00:52:59.889]  They've just dug their own graves.
[00:53:00.749 --> 00:53:02.269]  But they couldn't help be predators.
[00:53:02.649 --> 00:53:03.790]  They couldn't help but steal.
[00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:06.350]  They couldn't help but go with their big power trip.
[00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:12.072]  They couldn't help but make their move and not think a bunch of steps ahead.
[00:53:14.864 --> 00:53:16.545]  And so now that's what they've done.
[00:53:18.085 --> 00:53:20.346]  So they have initiated the countdown to this.
[00:53:21.106 --> 00:53:22.267]  And this isn't going away now.
[00:53:22.807 --> 00:53:24.207]  I work to try to stop it.
[00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:31.030]  And I thought maybe, we woke enough people up, we could have an awakening and not let this go through.
[00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:39.052]  But I always said we probably won't stop them triggering and launching the New World Order takeover, the Great Reset.
[00:53:39.072 --> 00:53:41.133]  I've said this hundreds of times, you've heard me.
[00:53:42.574 --> 00:53:43.154]  But we could.
[00:53:44.195 --> 00:54:11.842]  Maybe 20% chance, but I said there's a 90% chance, if we're active and care, to stop it once it goes operational, because it'll be so obviously tyrannical, so obviously dangerous, so obviously counter to anybody's best interests, that people will say no, and just say, by increment, we're brought deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into tyranny.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:20.686]  Because the globalists are all about lies and deception, but they themselves are the most deceived and are drinking their own Kool-Aid.
[00:54:23.147 --> 00:54:31.534]  So New York is going under martial law to train us and all prepare us for it to be nationwide and worldwide.
[00:54:31.554 --> 00:54:34.656]  I want to play a few clips of Hochul.
[00:54:34.677 --> 00:54:38.880]  I mean, anybody has a sermon, not just her actions.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.507]   The woman looks Like a supervillain.
[00:54:41.827 --> 00:54:49.191]  You know, if I was going to cast a wicked witch that ran around kidnapping and eating children, you know, Hansel and Gretel, it would be Hochul.
[00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:54.114]  But, I mean, she just looks like a... I mean, would you buy a car from her?
[00:54:54.675 --> 00:54:55.715]  Would you do a business deal with her?
[00:54:55.735 --> 00:54:58.977]  You know, this is a creepy, mentally ill, whack job.
[00:54:59.017 --> 00:55:01.379]  But that's who they hire.
[00:55:02.119 --> 00:55:04.721]  That's who they get because they need this type of scum.
[00:55:06.662 --> 00:55:07.643]  And look at Governor Whitmer.
[00:55:08.527 --> 00:55:09.988]  I'm not sitting on them out because they're women.
[00:55:10.969 --> 00:55:15.413]  I mean, Whitmer looks like the female version of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.
[00:55:16.494 --> 00:55:18.135]  Governor Newsom is the spitting image of it.
[00:55:18.656 --> 00:55:23.880]  But I mean, anybody that has discernment, you just look at these people and go, that's a villain!
[00:55:24.281 --> 00:55:34.450]  And when they talk, and the things they say, and the things they do, but that's the scum that the WEF and the CIA and the New World Order has assembled against us.
[00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:41.643]  And she's too dumb following all these orders to not realize she's destroying herself and her own family.
[00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:45.084]  They're not taking Hoechlin to the bunker when World War III starts.
[00:55:46.145 --> 00:55:48.266]  They're not going to give Hoechlin a lot of such technologies.
[00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:58.770]  Hoechlin is the enemy mark, the enemy sucker, the enemy stooge, the enemy schmuck.
[00:56:00.489 --> 00:56:03.832]  That lowers the drawbridge at night so the enemy can invade.
[00:56:04.573 --> 00:56:09.398]  What do you think the enemy, once she lowers the drawbridge, does to the traitor that lowered the drawbridge?
[00:56:09.779 --> 00:56:12.661]  The first person's throat they slit is hers.
[00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:15.344]  And I wish no harm upon her.
[00:56:16.045 --> 00:56:19.789]  But I'm just saying, emblematically, the traitor is the plug.
[00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.411]  All right, go ahead and roll those clips of Hoechlin.
[00:56:26.791 --> 00:56:30.954]  Roll some of the B-roll of them searching people without warrants and all the rest of it.
[00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:34.096]  Roll all the, with audio, roll all the clips.
[00:56:35.757 --> 00:56:36.277]  Point one.
[00:56:38.498 --> 00:56:51.346]  I'm redeploying nearly 1,000 members of the New York State Police, MTA Police, and MTA National Guard to conduct bag checks in the city's busiest transit.
[00:56:51.366 --> 00:56:56.522]   They'll start seeing them at the tables Making sure that weapons are not being brought in.
[00:56:57.163 --> 00:57:04.250]  Working in concert with our New York State Police as well as our NYPD.
[00:57:06.288 --> 00:57:15.090]  Because no one heading to their job or to visit family or to go to a doctor appointment should worry that the person sitting next to them possesses a deadly weapon.
[00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:16.551]  They're gonna search bags?
[00:57:17.211 --> 00:57:17.851]  Randomly.
[00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:18.451]  Randomly.
[00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.572]  There is a statistical... What happens if you don't want your bag searched?
[00:57:22.052 --> 00:57:22.712]  Then go home.
[00:57:23.092 --> 00:57:24.693]  You can... We're not going to search you.
[00:57:24.533 --> 00:57:27.533]  you can say no, but you're not taking the subway.
[00:57:27.533 --> 00:57:34.533]  So the border's wide open.
[00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:44.738]  They defund the police, they let all the criminals out of jail in New York, Alvin Bragg, Soros, and now they're going to search all of you because you're all criminals now.
[00:57:48.261 --> 00:57:51.563]  This is an administrative state at war with the people.
[00:57:51.883 --> 00:57:53.124]  So this is the TSA.
[00:57:53.644 --> 00:57:56.186]  I told you they would expand the TSA program out to everything.
[00:57:58.668 --> 00:58:07.867]  They've now done it.
[00:58:07.867 --> 00:58:11.948]  Container inspection zone.
[00:58:12.118 --> 00:58:14.199]  And they just keep expanding it everywhere.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.082]  And if you're somebody they don't like, you're an anti-globalist, well, you get disappeared.
[00:58:19.603 --> 00:58:22.145]  And the average cop will be part of it and say, sir, please come over here to this room.
[00:58:22.705 --> 00:58:29.330]  And then the special leftist units, for a virus, whatever excuse they've got, they take you away.
[00:58:31.312 --> 00:58:33.173]  So it's all a compliance drill.
[00:58:33.991 --> 00:58:42.313]  Defund the police, let the criminals out of jail, don't charge people for violent crimes, and then say, oh, we'll save you, you're all slaves now.
[00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.894]  And it's not like I'm saying this now.
[00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:56.497]  How many times did I tell you that once they defunded the police and let the criminals out of jail, it would devolve into martial law, and then they'd say, oh, it's okay, we'll just put troops on the streets.
[00:58:58.957 --> 00:59:02.118]  And now Union Boss calls for National Guard rollout of Chicago's.
[00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:08.562]  That was just yesterday.
[00:59:09.603 --> 00:59:10.164]  What did that tell you?
[00:59:14.346 --> 00:59:16.108]  And you've already done it at the airport.
[00:59:18.249 --> 00:59:25.574]  The only place you won't get searched and have your balls grubbed will be if you're coming across the border with a smuggled kid you kidnapped.
[00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:31.193]  Then you're going to get $90,000 a year and free airfare and no documents to fly and everything's okay.
[00:59:31.213 --> 00:59:34.955]  They're going to sign you up with an NGO that gets you federal money that they take a piece of.
[00:59:34.975 --> 00:59:39.518]  And they're going to fast track you to be in the military or the police.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.961]  And then the military and the police, they're just there following orders.
[00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:49.303]  They're just there as all of this is unfolding.
[00:59:51.825 --> 00:59:53.506]  All right, I want to play a special report.
[00:59:53.326 --> 00:59:55.326]  We're going to get Roger Stone on the show.
[00:59:55.326 --> 01:00:05.326]  Let's play this R.F.K. Jr.
[01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:05.468]  clip.
[01:00:06.148 --> 01:00:07.229]  It's not like RFK Jr.
[01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:12.552]  Clip 22 talks vaccines on a podcast in 2020.
[01:00:14.413 --> 01:00:19.735]  And then let's play clip 21, the Bill Gates clip.
[01:00:19.795 --> 01:00:20.156]  It's funny.
[01:00:22.437 --> 01:00:27.501]   And then Let's play clip 13.
[01:00:28.983 --> 01:00:38.113]  And the great Roger Stone is joining us via the phone as he drives in Florida to a big Republican event he is doing tonight.
[01:00:38.153 --> 01:00:38.694]  Here's the clips.
[01:00:39.395 --> 01:00:40.756]  Well, vaccines are magic.
[01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:41.677]  They can...
[01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:48.357]  Everybody thinks, you know, when they hear, okay, you're going to stay locked down until there's a vaccine.
[01:00:48.837 --> 01:00:50.798]  As Bill Gates said, a magical vaccine.
[01:00:51.298 --> 01:01:03.040]  They're thinking that, oh, the vaccine's going to do what we've been told vaccines do, which is to give everybody who gets one lifetime immunity and no, you know, major health problems.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.481]  What are the chances they're actually going to get a vaccine like that?
[01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:09.701]  I would say zero.
[01:01:11.302 --> 01:01:12.202]  Here's what I predict.
[01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:22.390]  I predict you're going to be seeing Bill Gates and Tony Fauci, week after week, dampening expectations about the vaccine.
[01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:27.074]  They were originally saying it's a magical vaccine we're going to give to everybody and everybody is going to get the immune.
[01:01:27.534 --> 01:01:33.919]  And they're going to say, well, actually only 80% of people will get the immune.
[01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:34.639]  And then they'll say 70%.
[01:01:34.779 --> 01:01:36.260]  And they'll say 50%.
[01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:37.842]  And then they'll say 20%.
[01:01:40.323 --> 01:01:42.586]  Um, it's still worth it to have 20%.
[01:01:43.206 --> 01:01:45.048]  And they'll try to sell us on that.
[01:01:45.448 --> 01:01:46.269]  Alright, breaking news.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:53.096]  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer just announced moments ago that its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective.
[01:01:53.196 --> 01:01:56.539]  Meg, we should point out that Pfizer shares are up by about 3% on this news.
[01:01:56.659 --> 01:01:58.081]  Obviously more good news there.
[01:01:58.101 --> 01:01:58.081]  91%.
[01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:58.681]  90% efficacy rate.
[01:02:01.744 --> 01:02:04.407]  This is a great vaccine.
[01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:06.289]  Great day for humanity.
[01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:07.330]  Great day for science.
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.311]  Great day for the markets.
[01:02:08.371 --> 01:02:14.837]  Check this out because it's got to be purchased, manufactured, and then there has to be money there for it to be purchased.
[01:02:14.877 --> 01:02:16.659]  And so the world needs to put up more money.
[01:02:16.779 --> 01:02:19.642]  Their vaccine's efficacy against COVID dropped from 96% to 84%.
[01:02:22.545 --> 01:02:25.463]  80% effective after just one dose.
[01:02:25.463 --> 01:02:27.264]  Just a single dose.
[01:02:27.264 --> 01:02:29.704]  A reduction of 75%.
[01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.144]  Those lines go down.
[01:02:31.144 --> 01:02:32.784]  Which fell below 50%.
[01:02:32.784 --> 01:02:34.945]   You can't even keep up with this because it's moving so quickly.
[01:02:34.945 --> 01:02:36.184]  42%.
[01:02:36.184 --> 01:02:37.384]  30 to 40%.
[01:02:37.384 --> 01:02:39.784]  Vaccine provides just 33% protection.
[01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:45.423]   We know no vaccine lasts forever, so the protection starts to wane a bit,
[01:02:45.423 --> 01:02:47.184]  and that's what the boost is all about.
[01:02:47.184 --> 01:02:49.025]   And then they're gonna say, well,
[01:02:49.025 --> 01:02:50.784]  vaccine.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.002]  Yeah, it's not actually lifetime immunity.
[01:02:53.743 --> 01:03:02.675]  Immunity only lasts for one year, one season, and actually maybe not even that, maybe only two or three months, and then you have to get another one.
[01:03:03.753 --> 01:03:06.355]  Don't worry so much about the number of boosters.
[01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.376]  It's not a one and done.
[01:03:08.376 --> 01:03:11.976]  Boosters, so-called third dose, it is confusing to people.
[01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:15.255]   It really is going to be about focusing on getting that shot just once a year.
[01:03:15.255 --> 01:03:16.855]  Much simpler, much easier to do.
[01:03:16.855 --> 01:03:18.815]  Don't worry so much about the number of boosters.
[01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:20.775]  Worry about when you got your last booster.
[01:03:20.775 --> 01:03:21.775]  Okay.
[01:03:21.775 --> 01:03:22.775]  Okay.
[01:03:22.775 --> 01:03:24.775]  This is the CEO of Moderna, Stéphane Boncel.
[01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:26.016]  What a blowout quarter.
[01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:27.253]  Congratulations to you!
[01:03:27.393 --> 01:03:29.634]  Oh yeah, we definitely think it's going to be a flu shot.
[01:03:29.654 --> 01:03:30.615]  COVID is not going away.
[01:03:30.675 --> 01:03:35.758]  And that's why we're also working on combining flu and COVID, so it's easier.
[01:03:36.439 --> 01:03:41.222]  The new updated COVID-19 vaccine is the most... And that's my prediction.
[01:03:42.002 --> 01:03:44.364]  You know, and I could be wrong, but I would say zero.
[01:03:44.484 --> 01:03:47.066]  And all you have to do is look at the flu vaccine.
[01:03:49.943 --> 01:03:53.665]  Well, thank you for illuminating all of this for us today.
[01:03:55.205 --> 01:03:59.087]  I want to leave on a positive note, but it's like, wow, we're screwed.
[01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:01.788]  And that's the magic of this thing.
[01:04:02.368 --> 01:04:07.690]  But there's no doubt in the next five years, we can, you know, we just need to mess around.
[01:04:08.571 --> 01:04:09.871]  Stop being gullible, people.
[01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:11.512]  Wake up and defend yourself.
[01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.588]  The New World Order is making its move.
[01:04:15.608 --> 01:04:17.349]  We just played Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:19.951]  in 2000 predicted they would say, oh, it's 90.
[01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:20.632]  Oh, it's 80.
[01:04:20.932 --> 01:04:21.132]  Oh, it's 70.
[01:04:21.313 --> 01:04:22.754]  And they did just that.
[01:04:22.874 --> 01:04:23.775]  It's not a vaccine.
[01:04:25.336 --> 01:04:27.058]  But that's not why we got Roger Stone on.
[01:04:27.218 --> 01:04:28.359]  I wanted to get Roger on.
[01:04:28.379 --> 01:04:33.183]  I was thinking about him with that incredibly disgusting State of the Union and all the lies of Biden.
[01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.425]  Trump's sweeping Super Tuesday.
[01:04:37.345 --> 01:04:38.486]  The deep state of panic mode.
[01:04:38.566 --> 01:04:42.788]  Tribs being called out of New York after they bring the illegals in and let the criminals out of jail.
[01:04:42.808 --> 01:04:48.292]  They're getting us ready for martial law because they know the world is waking up very, very fast.
[01:04:48.312 --> 01:04:55.596]  So Rogers barreling down the road, going to speak to a big Republican event tonight, but I wanted to get him on because he's been really calling it.
[01:04:56.076 --> 01:05:02.320]  He also said they would try to get Michelle Obama to run years ago, and then they started kind of pre-programming that.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:22.714]   Now, Alex, great to be back with you, and I must say I watched you and Tucker Carlson the other night here in the State of the Union.
[01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:26.217]  One of your best broadcasts everywhere, anytime.
[01:05:26.877 --> 01:05:41.686]   And you really called it in terms of the Deep State and the other actors already beginning In advance to try to remove a newly resurging Trump should he return to the White House.
[01:05:41.746 --> 01:05:44.169]  I mean you're really ahead of the curve on this stuff.
[01:05:45.451 --> 01:05:47.814]  Well we saw that Atlantic article a week and a half ago.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.481]  They actually wrote two, and again, they're the mouth of the establishment as you know.
[01:05:52.342 --> 01:05:55.844]  They said, if Trump wins the election, we'll just decertify him.
[01:05:56.384 --> 01:06:00.246]  So Trump did never say decertify, he said have an investigation to decertify this fraud.
[01:06:00.746 --> 01:06:11.191]  They're saying if he wins, being honest about it, we will then just have Congress remove him and not certify him as the president.
[01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:14.513]  Pretty desperate statements by them, Roger.
[01:06:15.796 --> 01:06:16.636]  Well, precisely.
[01:06:17.176 --> 01:06:24.779]  Particularly in view of the fact that right now that is what they're saying that Trump attempted to do, and they're claiming it's a crime.
[01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:33.802]  So now essentially they're saying if he is duly elected, we will simply refuse to certify the vote of the Electoral College.
[01:06:34.162 --> 01:06:41.405]  Exactly what they accused Trump of doing, and they say today is criminal.
[01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:44.006]  Now the difference is, I do believe Trump did win.
[01:06:45.094 --> 01:06:49.138]  But they're saying if he wins, we'll simply refuse to decertify him.
[01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:57.965]  Look, it's the same exact actors, it's the same exact entities, and they're in full panic mode after this last week.
[01:06:58.466 --> 01:07:15.653]   They cannot feel better after the blowout of Super Tuesday, where Trump set new records not just in terms of percentage of victory, but the turnout is indicative of the intensity And the level of his growing support.
[01:07:15.713 --> 01:07:16.814]  Now they look at the polls.
[01:07:17.314 --> 01:07:32.365]  And Alex, among African-Americans, among Hispanic-Americans, among Asian-Americans, among younger Americans, they see him, even before the campaign for the fall begins, hitting historic levels of support.
[01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:41.692]  So the Deep State and their allies in the fake news media, they are in full, complete panic mode.
[01:07:42.082 --> 01:07:44.483]  They are literally melting down.
[01:07:45.263 --> 01:07:56.385]  And now you had this disastrous State of the Union speech, which was, I must tell you, unlike anything I've ever seen in the 45 years I've been in American politics.
[01:07:58.285 --> 01:08:02.706]  Well, let's go through that in a moment, but since you bring up them in panic mode, I don't think that's an opinion.
[01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:03.567]  That's prima facie.
[01:08:03.587 --> 01:08:04.087]  It's everywhere.
[01:08:04.787 --> 01:08:05.107]  Roger.
[01:08:09.272 --> 01:08:12.755]  They know there's a political realignment happening, not just here, but around the world.
[01:08:13.395 --> 01:08:15.897]  They know everybody's turning against them, so they're pre-programming.
[01:08:16.017 --> 01:08:16.658]  I see it everywhere.
[01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:22.823]  Oh, there'll be race riots when Trump's elected, that if he calls the military out, we'll call him a dictator.
[01:08:22.843 --> 01:08:31.710]  They're trying to strip him of his domestic powers and the Insurrection Act that George Walker Bush used, I think rightfully so, during the L.A.
[01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:32.090]  riots.
[01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.132]  I don't like George Walker Bush, but that was right to do.
[01:08:36.053 --> 01:08:40.716]  I don't want people to feel overconfident that it's a shoe-in, but a landslide's hard to beat.
[01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:46.960]  But they are really already moving into how they're going to counter him once he gets in, when he's president-elect.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:58.447]  What is your response to all this race war talk they're pushing, and now New York calling out the military after they defunded the police and had Alvin Bragg release all these hardened criminals?
[01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.848]  What's the larger picture there?
[01:09:01.838 --> 01:09:04.320]  I think you've hit it right on the head, Alex.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.403]  You have Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut.
[01:09:07.783 --> 01:09:08.364]  Remember him?
[01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:11.826]  He's the guy who lied about serving his country in Vietnam.
[01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:22.495]  He's sponsoring legislation and trying to jam through the Senate to essentially remove the President of the United States' control of the military.
[01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:26.879]  So to end civilian control of our military.
[01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:37.909]   The purpose of that is Clearly when Trump is re-elected, which I really believe in my heart is going to happen, and they go out and foment the kind of
[01:09:38.596 --> 01:09:54.583]  In TIFA and Black Lives Matter riots we had in early 2020, they're trying to remove the President's ability to restore order, which of course, as you know, under the Constitution, is his first and most important responsibility.
[01:09:54.964 --> 01:10:11.069]   So they're trying to both condition us to the fact that there's going to be insurrection, insurrection that they foment, and then secondarily strip the President's ability Uh, to restore order, which is, of course, his responsibility.
[01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:12.531]  And they're open about it.
[01:10:12.551 --> 01:10:13.892]  They brag about it.
[01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:17.435]  They're not even hiding it, at least in the Mueller witch hunt.
[01:10:18.055 --> 01:10:26.702]  They went through this facade of pretending that they really believed that there was Russian collusion, when in fact they knew there was none.
[01:10:27.183 --> 01:10:30.045]  They knew the Steele dossier was a fraud.
[01:10:30.465 --> 01:10:33.008]  They knew that the DNC had never been hacked.
[01:10:33.488 --> 01:10:38.647]   All of the key elements of that And I totally agree with you.
[01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:41.068]  So let's let this sink in.
[01:10:40.908 --> 01:10:42.788]  Now they're not even pretending.
[01:10:42.788 --> 01:10:50.708]   They will not respect a constitutionally sound American presidential election.
[01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:52.708]  And I totally agree with you.
[01:10:52.708 --> 01:10:54.448]  So let's let this sink in.
[01:10:54.448 --> 01:11:00.427]   They've introduced legislation to strip the president of the power to put down criminal
[01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:07.828]   rebellion, which is a coup against the office of the president and the American people that
[01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:08.668]  would elect him.
[01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:16.927]  And then they're saying they're doing it to protect us from Trump using the military when they're the ones trying to preemptively take control of the military.
[01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:18.929]  This is so transparent.
[01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:26.656]  Well, to put it another way, we have to destroy democracy in order to preserve democracy.
[01:11:26.776 --> 01:11:29.558]  Look, everything they say is backwards.
[01:11:30.279 --> 01:11:36.537]   They are the ones Who have tried, thank God for the Supreme Court here, to keep Donald Trump off the ballot.
[01:11:36.938 --> 01:11:40.159]  What could be more anti-democratic than that?
[01:11:40.519 --> 01:11:44.860]  They don't even want to have a free, fair, honest, transparent election.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:51.902]  Secondarily, they are trying to lock up the leading candidate of the opposition party.
[01:11:52.615 --> 01:11:57.317]  And they're trying to do so on the basis of fabricated charges in DC.
[01:11:57.678 --> 01:12:02.960]  Fabricated charges in Florida pertaining to his... And Roger, let's stop there.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.401]  I want you to, I'm going to shut up for a few minutes.
[01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:09.083]  Give us a review of the cases, how they're derailing, how they're backfiring, where you see that going.
[01:12:09.123 --> 01:12:12.765]  But absolutely, they're the ones openly trying to take him off the ballot.
[01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.263]  Look, I think they understand that they're not going to win a free, open election.
[01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:21.283]   preemptively by him off the ballot. I mean the public has gotten this. They
[01:12:21.283 --> 01:12:25.643]   understand this. So what do you think Jack Smith and them are thinking? They
[01:12:25.643 --> 01:12:29.123]   thought this would all work. It's backfired. And then let's talk about some
[01:12:29.123 --> 01:12:34.363]   of the cases. Then let's talk about that State of the Union and Biden. Look I
[01:12:34.363 --> 01:12:39.442]   think they understand that they're not going to win a free open election. So the
[01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:44.962]   purpose of all of these prosecutions, whether it is in Georgia, whether it is
[01:12:44.962 --> 01:12:50.043]   in South Florida, pertaining to his handling of documents, whether it is in
[01:12:50.043 --> 01:12:53.122]  DC.
[01:12:51.578 --> 01:12:58.182]  pertaining to January 6th, is to drain his campaign of money, drain his time particularly.
[01:12:58.482 --> 01:13:01.684]  Because in politics, time is a crucial asset.
[01:13:01.785 --> 01:13:04.967]  It's actually the only asset you can't get more of.
[01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.649]  It's the only asset that is finite.
[01:13:07.809 --> 01:13:11.171]  Time is a vital asset in a political campaign.
[01:13:11.841 --> 01:13:18.783]  They're trying to drain his time so that he is basically, as you know, in a criminal trial, you have to be present.
[01:13:19.403 --> 01:13:27.845]  Therefore, they want him to have to sit in the dock in a criminal trial in September or October when he should be out campaigning.
[01:13:28.565 --> 01:13:33.446]  And on top of all of that, of course, they hope to further blacken his name.
[01:13:33.986 --> 01:13:35.967]  That, so far, is not working.
[01:13:36.327 --> 01:13:39.548]  In fact, it's having the direct opposite effect.
[01:13:41.499 --> 01:13:42.840]  Forty years that I've known him, 45.
[01:13:44.081 --> 01:13:52.867]  But in the 25 years I've watched this politically, he's never been stronger than he is at this exact moment.
[01:13:53.568 --> 01:13:55.990]  And that's why they don't think they can win an election.
[01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:00.193]  They have to use this tsunami of lawfare against him.
[01:14:00.233 --> 01:14:01.934]  Now, Alex, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:14:02.014 --> 01:14:05.257]  I do see, very much see, the hand of God.
[01:14:06.077 --> 01:14:10.240]  It is a work of the Lord Almighty that the U.S.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.974]   Supreme Court Did not bar him from the ballot.
[01:14:12.994 --> 01:14:16.295]  That this was not politically decided, but decided on its own.
[01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:17.435]  Well, that's where I was going next.
[01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:18.355]  Elaborate on that.
[01:14:18.415 --> 01:14:21.396]  How big and how seismic is this Supreme Court ruling?
[01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:23.696]  Because it looks like they're going to repudiate all of this now.
[01:14:27.377 --> 01:14:44.629]   You have to assume that Norm Eisen and the people who fomented this entire fraudulent argument that he's not eligible to be on the ballot because he engaged in insurrection, a crime that he's never been charged, Or convicted of has collapsed into dust.
[01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:47.491]  So they're apoplectic about that.
[01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:52.973]  Now they're putting all of their eggs in the immunity basket.
[01:14:53.794 --> 01:14:59.917]  I am praying for another Supreme Court victory on the issue of presidential immunity.
[01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:05.720]  I had Will Sharp, one of the president's attorneys, on my WABC radio show.
[01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:07.942]  This will air on Sunday.
[01:15:07.982 --> 01:15:10.483]  We pre-recorded that segment on Friday.
[01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:12.283]  Very, very sharp.
[01:15:12.744 --> 01:15:13.944]  Very articulate.
[01:15:14.285 --> 01:15:33.961]  Very on the ball in terms of understanding that the immunity argument is crucial, and that Trump was clearly acting within the confines of his responsibilities as president on January 6th, and thus does have immunity from prosecution.
[01:15:34.641 --> 01:15:39.385]  I pray that the Supreme Court sees it correctly, as Will Scharf outlined it.
[01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:52.082]  Well, look, we know there's different factions and different elites in America, but what elite, what billionaire group, even if they're globalists, would want to have no rule of law, no due process?
[01:15:52.562 --> 01:15:56.606]  They're going to be hunted down as well once this hysteria kicks into high gear.
[01:15:56.646 --> 01:16:01.370]  And now we had Hochul two weeks ago say, don't worry, we only did this politically to get Trump.
[01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:03.092]  More people left New York.
[01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.213]  More companies said, well, you just admitted it.
[01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.838]  If she said, oh, no, he's really guilty, they might have bought it.
[01:16:08.878 --> 01:16:10.600]  But no, she said, no, it's only because he's Trump.
[01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:16.387]  And so, you know, we saw O'Leary and others make that point.
[01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:22.434]  Now she's going after the biggest beef packing company, trying to shut them down and bragging about it.
[01:16:24.856 --> 01:16:33.502]  They don't think a few steps ahead of what they're doing, but I would think they're smart enough to see everything backfiring, they're going to back down.
[01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:45.391]  But because Soros and the Deep State have put so many mindless quizlings in, like Letitia James and Fannie Willis, they have that arrogance of the ignorant.
[01:16:45.571 --> 01:16:48.353]  They have that assurity of the stupid.
[01:16:48.553 --> 01:16:52.561]   Because Aristotle said, I know that I know nothing.
[01:16:53.282 --> 01:16:59.931]  The more you know, the more power you get, the more you realize that you make major mistakes even when you try.
[01:17:00.371 --> 01:17:02.915]  These people have almost an invincible ignorance.
[01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:13.366]  Unconfident Trump's going to win, I'm confident he is, but I'm very confident they're going to double down, which is so destructive, just like their war with Russia.
[01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:24.168]  So kind of give us a recap of all the criminal cases, because I know you're up to date on that, and you talked to the big guy, not Joe Biden, the real big guy, but how you see this playing out.
[01:17:25.529 --> 01:17:35.511]  Well, obviously we see the Georgia case crumbling with the focus on Fannie Wills and the epic corruption of that prosecution.
[01:17:35.922 --> 01:17:46.729]  You have two key cases, one in state courts, one in the federal courts, that really question the underlying premise that Trump lost Georgia.
[01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:55.635]  They're questioning in this federal case in front of Judge Amy Totenberg whether these machines have been corrupted.
[01:17:55.695 --> 01:17:58.077]  I think that is a crucial development.
[01:17:59.118 --> 01:18:02.580]  The court in D.C.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:03.941]  is very clear.
[01:18:04.163 --> 01:18:11.842]   that the special counsel, Jack Smith, urgently, desperately wants a trial prior to the election.
[01:18:11.842 --> 01:18:21.722]   Even the New York Times and CNN both editorially criticized him for being so brazen about it.
[01:18:21.722 --> 01:18:27.243]   Congressman Matt Gaetz wrote a terrific letter to the inspector general of the Justice Department
[01:18:27.243 --> 01:18:34.483]   which he basically said special counsel Smith is open about the fact that he's violating
[01:18:34.483 --> 01:18:43.202]   DOJ protocol by having a criminal election that interferes, a criminal prosecution that
[01:18:43.202 --> 01:18:49.723]   interferes with an upcoming election, which the DOJ has always respected.
[01:18:49.778 --> 01:19:03.102]  And then, of course, it's very hard to know what's going on in the so-called documents case, because so much of the proceedings right now are under seal, meaning we don't really know what documents they're talking about.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.741]  We don't know what the documents pertain to.
[01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:08.701]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:19:09.322 --> 01:19:21.525]  With the Supreme Court taking up the immunity case, which not just with the ruling of a week ago, but now these new rulings, signals they see this is pure tyranny to try to take him off the ballot without him being indicted.
[01:19:21.605 --> 01:19:22.766]  It's the end of due process.
[01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:24.606]  It's slavery is what the ruling said.
[01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:28.507]  It turns the president into a slave and all of us slaves of the courts as well.
[01:19:29.107 --> 01:19:30.148]  What are they going to do?
[01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:32.158]  You're a smart guy.
[01:19:32.178 --> 01:19:33.298]  I really want you to think on this.
[01:19:33.879 --> 01:19:35.420]  What is the Deep State going to do?
[01:19:36.121 --> 01:19:39.083]  Because they don't have a Midas touch where everything they do turns to gold.
[01:19:39.643 --> 01:19:40.904]  Everything they do turns to shit.
[01:19:40.924 --> 01:19:42.506]  So what are they going to do?
[01:19:44.267 --> 01:19:52.413]  Well, I could see a favorable ruling in which they say that the president has immunity for the acts of January 6th.
[01:19:52.793 --> 01:20:00.059]  But I can also see a ruling where they try to say, well, presidents generally have immunity unless you're Donald J. Trump.
[01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:15.457]  And we therefore deem the specific act that he is accused of on January 6th to be outside the outer perimeter, to use the exact words from Nixon versus Fitzgerald, of his presidency.
[01:20:15.658 --> 01:20:18.700]  I'm not a lawyer, so I could see it going either way.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:27.165]  To say that the high court does not take politics into consideration, I'm afraid that's just not realistic.
[01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:34.704]   But then, Alex, I really do want to touch on Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:34.744 --> 01:20:35.604]  Let's do that in a moment.
[01:20:36.805 --> 01:20:39.465]  It's great to have you while you're driving this big event tonight.
[01:20:39.746 --> 01:20:40.806]  Where are you speaking this evening?
[01:20:41.866 --> 01:20:48.668]  I'm talking to the Collier County Republicans' Lincoln-Reagan Day Dinner in Fort Myers, Florida tonight.
[01:20:48.688 --> 01:20:50.268]  It's a great honor for me.
[01:20:50.488 --> 01:20:54.611]   Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson He's the other major speaker.
[01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.072]  That guy is on fire, Alex.
[01:20:57.592 --> 01:21:01.753]  He's a future governor, I think even a future president.
[01:21:02.193 --> 01:21:10.234]  The left is going out of their mind because he is such a hardliner when it comes to freedom and the Constitution.
[01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:12.095]  He's so outspoken.
[01:21:12.455 --> 01:21:13.255]  I've never met him.
[01:21:13.355 --> 01:21:16.055]  I'm really honored to be on a double bill with him.
[01:21:16.836 --> 01:21:18.876]  Frankly, I'm driving all afternoon to get there.
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.142]  Very much so, because I want to meet Mark Robinson.
[01:21:22.182 --> 01:21:24.964]  Everything I've seen, I've been extremely impressed with.
[01:21:25.245 --> 01:21:25.785]  Good news.
[01:21:25.865 --> 01:21:28.167]  More great talent rising.
[01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:31.690]  Okay, so I want to get into the State of the Union, which is a train wreck.
[01:21:33.071 --> 01:21:34.512]  Barking at the moon, crazy person.
[01:21:35.213 --> 01:21:36.393]  Obviously, meth out of his mind.
[01:21:36.454 --> 01:21:37.314]  You can see the videos.
[01:21:37.714 --> 01:21:41.015]   But before we get to that, You don't kiss and tell.
[01:21:41.056 --> 01:21:43.697]  You don't talk about your long 45-year relationship with Trump.
[01:21:45.517 --> 01:21:47.158]  But in general, you say he's stronger than ever.
[01:21:47.358 --> 01:21:48.259]  We all see that.
[01:21:48.899 --> 01:21:56.622]  Talk about, before we get into the State of the Union and Biden, the opposite of Trump, this puppet creature that stole the election.
[01:21:57.502 --> 01:21:59.283]  How is the big guy doing?
[01:22:01.544 --> 01:22:03.505]  You know, Alex, amazingly well.
[01:22:03.705 --> 01:22:08.367]  So he tells me that he's done this intermittent fasting diet.
[01:22:09.048 --> 01:22:11.730]  Which explains the fact that he's lost almost 20 pounds.
[01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:13.771]  He really looks good.
[01:22:13.811 --> 01:22:16.053]  He looks better than he's looked in years.
[01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:21.717]  He's also got a very healthy glow and I don't think it's coming from a sun lamp.
[01:22:22.657 --> 01:22:25.099]  He's in an excellent mood.
[01:22:25.159 --> 01:22:29.222]  I mean, I don't know really how he bears the burden that he bears.
[01:22:29.662 --> 01:22:33.765]  He has 91 pending criminal charges against him.
[01:22:34.178 --> 01:22:35.379]  They're trying to put him away.
[01:22:35.419 --> 01:22:39.582]  I can't remember whether it's 600 years or 700 years, but it's around there.
[01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:47.528]  Yet, he remains good-humored, upbeat, extremely resolute.
[01:22:48.148 --> 01:22:49.069]  I'd be furious.
[01:22:49.509 --> 01:22:51.311]  I would be so angry right now.
[01:22:51.671 --> 01:22:53.072]  I'd be consumed with anger.
[01:22:53.472 --> 01:22:54.073]  I've been there.
[01:22:54.093 --> 01:22:59.697]  There's a little tinge of anger, but he's extremely determined.
[01:22:59.717 --> 01:23:02.219]  That's why he's campaigning in Georgia today.
[01:23:02.867 --> 01:23:05.148]  His head is in a very, very good place.
[01:23:05.849 --> 01:23:09.251]  And physically, I think he's in the best shape of his life.
[01:23:09.431 --> 01:23:12.353]  Now you compare that with his successor.
[01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:21.018]  I see Peter Baker of the New York Times last week on social media trying to say, oh, Trump couldn't remember his wife's name.
[01:23:21.218 --> 01:23:22.278]  What's he talking about?
[01:23:22.599 --> 01:23:25.921]  The guy who confused his wife and his sister on the stump.
[01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:27.702]  By the way, that was three years ago.
[01:23:27.982 --> 01:23:29.883]  That was Joe Biden, not Donald Trump.
[01:23:32.165 --> 01:23:39.946]  All right, I want to get to the State of the Union, but right now, you have said they plan to replace him at the convention.
[01:23:39.986 --> 01:23:41.227]  They've certainly talked about it.
[01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:41.867]  They pushed it.
[01:23:42.407 --> 01:23:44.567]  But then you said, well, he's refusing to go.
[01:23:45.047 --> 01:23:46.367]  What is the latest scoop on?
[01:23:46.427 --> 01:23:47.228]  Is it Big Mike?
[01:23:47.788 --> 01:23:48.728]  Is it Gavin Newsom?
[01:23:48.808 --> 01:23:52.749]  Or are they going to go ahead and just roll the dice with Biden?
[01:23:52.769 --> 01:23:57.969]  Well, I think there's probably internecine warfare going on in the Democratic Party right now.
[01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:03.772]   If anything, I don't think that State of the Union Performance made things better for Biden.
[01:24:04.132 --> 01:24:05.773]  I think they made things worse.
[01:24:06.613 --> 01:24:11.994]  It once again demonstrated his, shall we say, uneven performance.
[01:24:12.174 --> 01:24:19.076]  I mean, he went from screaming like a lunatic to mispronouncing names, words.
[01:24:20.256 --> 01:24:23.817]  The next day, he acts like he's running for Congress in Philadelphia.
[01:24:23.857 --> 01:24:26.217]  So, I don't think Joe wants to go.
[01:24:26.237 --> 01:24:30.338]  I don't think Dr. Jill wants Joe to go.
[01:24:31.141 --> 01:24:35.943]  I know that Hunter and Jimmy Biden don't want Joe to go.
[01:24:36.543 --> 01:24:45.766]  And Joe really, he really thinks, as he said in that angry press conference, that he's the best qualified person in the country to be president.
[01:24:46.586 --> 01:24:47.226]  What did he say?
[01:24:47.507 --> 01:24:48.987]  Who else could do what I've done?
[01:24:49.727 --> 01:24:53.048]  Indeed, my friend, who could ruin our economy the way you have?
[01:24:53.409 --> 01:25:00.611]  Who could open our borders and give us a fentanyl and a crime crisis and a fiscal crisis as you have done?
[01:25:01.227 --> 01:25:03.808]  So, I don't think he wants to go, Alex.
[01:25:04.328 --> 01:25:17.413]  On the other hand, I don't think the Democratic Party media cabal led by Barack Obama have any confidence that Obama can, that Biden can lead them into an election.
[01:25:17.814 --> 01:25:32.529]   So, I still believe that if they have to leverage the 25th Amendment against him behind the scenes to get him to announce shortly before the Democratic Convention that he is not going to stand for re-election.
[01:25:32.529 --> 01:25:34.529]  He's not going to quit, not going to resign.
[01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:37.689]  He'll fill out the term, but that he won't run.
[01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:46.048]   And then as I have said, I think the convention will demand and will draft Michelle Obama
[01:25:46.048 --> 01:25:50.708]   and they'll convince her to do it simply because they will make the case
[01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:54.489]  that she is the strongest possible candidate against Trump.
[01:25:54.489 --> 01:25:57.248]   So- - Well, Roger, we know when they say
[01:25:57.248 --> 01:26:01.130]   they're not going to run, they're planning to run, Just like Gavin Newsom.
[01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:10.740]  So what did you make of Big Mike this week through her spokesperson saying that he's not going to run?
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.801]  I found it interesting, first of all, that she herself did not post that on social media.
[01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.782]  So her press office, her press spokesman, put out a statement.
[01:26:21.337 --> 01:26:29.724]  She was talking on her social media at the same time about voter registration and the need to register more liberal voters.
[01:26:31.246 --> 01:26:38.852]  In American politics, where a politician says they're not going to do something, as you know, that means that that's exactly what they're going to do.
[01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:41.334]  In this case, it's a little more complicated.
[01:26:41.855 --> 01:26:45.237]  By that I mean, I think she's going to be drafted.
[01:26:45.738 --> 01:26:47.720]  I think she's a reluctant candidate.
[01:26:48.502 --> 01:26:55.024]  Yeah, you've been saying that for three years, and we certainly saw the push the last few months to prep her.
[01:26:56.025 --> 01:27:04.468]  So this is just, again, preparing people to, as you said, for multiple years, that she is the reluctant warrior.
[01:27:06.628 --> 01:27:09.849]  And again, they have a giant problem in Kamala Harris.
[01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:12.270]  What do they do with Kamala Harris?
[01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:20.522]   If Joe cannot make the race, and based on that performance the other day, I think the evidence is growing that he cannot.
[01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:28.369]  Well, by all rights, by tradition, it is the sitting vice president who should be next in line.
[01:27:28.749 --> 01:27:32.273]  But they realize that she can't win a general election either.
[01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:35.676]  In fact, if anything, she's weaker than Joe Biden.
[01:27:36.276 --> 01:27:40.900]  So, look, I think there has to be some kind of a deft move here.
[01:27:41.721 --> 01:27:43.563]  Barack Obama is calling the shots.
[01:27:44.062 --> 01:28:05.307]  He's the single most influential Democrat in the country, so he's got to prevail on his wife to run, which I think he can do, and he's got to prevail on the woman he got on the ticket, as we now know, Kamala Harris, to take a dive in return for a promise of the first appointment to the U.S.
[01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:15.147]   Supreme Court in the event the Democrats hold the White House and hold a narrow margin In the Senate, where she would have to be confirmed.
[01:28:15.547 --> 01:28:23.468]  As a former Senator, as a former Attorney General, unfortunately she's totally confirmable if they have the votes.
[01:28:24.329 --> 01:28:26.769]  That's how I see it folded out.
[01:28:27.009 --> 01:28:27.729]  But we shall see.
[01:28:27.749 --> 01:28:29.810]  Alright, Roger, you're a tough guy.
[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:31.810]  I think of myself as pretty tough.
[01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:34.511]  But people should also know we're under massive attack.
[01:28:34.571 --> 01:28:39.852]  So, first and foremost, I want listeners to pray for you and pray for me and pray for Trump and pray for America and the world and peace.

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:28.485]  You've been through the gauntlet like I have, and they see you as like a Roman standard, like the eagle that they want to pull down and capture.
[01:30:28.905 --> 01:30:33.928]  So it's very important for people to realize they pushed you to the edge of destruction, but you've still persevered.
[01:30:34.368 --> 01:30:35.628]  Help people find your shows.
[01:30:35.648 --> 01:30:42.244]   We're going to get into Well, you can go to StoneZone.com where you can see my daily show, which is also at Rumble.com slash Roger Stone.
[01:30:42.204 --> 01:30:46.904]   you know, gracious to have you here. We appreciate you being here. But how do people support
[01:30:46.904 --> 01:30:47.904]  Roger Stone?
[01:30:47.904 --> 01:30:56.063]   Well, you can go to stonezone.com where you can see my daily show, which is also at rumble,
[01:30:56.063 --> 01:31:04.403]   rumble.com/rogerstone. You can go to the store at stonezone.com, get copies of all my books,

[01:31:11.223 --> 01:31:17.463]   or actually very popular yet again, "The Clinton's War on Women," the very first book in the
[01:31:17.463 --> 01:31:24.904]   country to fully expose Jeffrey Epstein, what he was doing on the island, his key role in
[01:31:24.904 --> 01:31:31.463]   the financing of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative. All of that
[01:31:31.463 --> 01:31:35.063]  available at stonezone.com.
[01:31:35.084 --> 01:31:36.445]  So I invite people to go there.
[01:31:36.785 --> 01:31:40.747]  From that point, you can jump off and hear my WABC radio show.
[01:31:41.447 --> 01:31:47.750]  You can also go, of course, to the Stone Legal Defense Fund, the Stone Family Fund.
[01:31:47.890 --> 01:31:59.515]  Alex, Mrs. Stone is going in for surgery this coming week to alleviate some of the discomfort from her successful war against cancer.
[01:31:59.952 --> 01:32:05.317]  So I do ask for the prayers of everybody out there in the InfoWarrior community.
[01:32:05.337 --> 01:32:15.267]  It's a delicate, not a life-threatening, but a delicate surgery and we're really hoping it will help alleviate a lot of her discomfort and pain.
[01:32:15.847 --> 01:32:17.008]  Well let's just go back to this.
[01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:24.976]  You and I were chosen, along with Trump, for destruction and the fact that we're still on air is a victory in the face of the enemy.
[01:32:26.027 --> 01:32:27.569]  So it's that simple, folks.
[01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.811]  I could have sold out, so could have Roger.
[01:32:30.132 --> 01:32:32.174]  He could have lied about Trump, and they'd have left him alone.
[01:32:32.194 --> 01:32:33.175]  They would have given him $100 million.
[01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:33.876]  He didn't do it.
[01:32:34.357 --> 01:32:34.857]  I haven't either.
[01:32:35.218 --> 01:32:38.481]  So just realize, we're common sense, regular guys.
[01:32:38.501 --> 01:32:40.103]  We don't get up here and bitch and complain like the left.
[01:32:40.484 --> 01:32:43.267]  But the only reason we're still on air is because of you.
[01:32:44.346 --> 01:32:45.187]  So go to StoneZone.
[01:32:45.867 --> 01:32:47.649]  Get a Rogers Don't Do Nothing Wrong t-shirt.
[01:32:48.069 --> 01:32:49.510]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.411]  Get a Team Humanity shirt.
[01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:55.214]  Because we're so busy in the fight against the New World Order, we don't tell you how bad it is for us personally.
[01:32:55.875 --> 01:33:01.679]  We're doing this for you because our children and our grandchildren, in Roger's case, are going to grow up with your kids.
[01:33:01.799 --> 01:33:03.140]  We see you just like us.
[01:33:03.441 --> 01:33:04.341]  We are good guys.
[01:33:04.782 --> 01:33:06.303]  And we can only be here because of you.
[01:33:06.703 --> 01:33:07.744]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:33:07.964 --> 01:33:09.045]  All right, I'm going to do this, Roger.
[01:33:09.685 --> 01:33:13.967]  I'm going to subject this since you want to get to this, and I wanted to cover it too, but I still hate it.
[01:33:15.148 --> 01:33:22.232]  Let's play clip three, Biden heckled by MTG, where he says he's going to stop illegals killing people when he's the one letting them in when they're criminals.
[01:33:22.812 --> 01:33:32.538]  Play clip three, and then play clip four, and then play clip one on Roe v. Wade.
[01:33:32.558 --> 01:33:36.240]  We'll get Roger's take straight ahead, the great Roger Stone, on this.
[01:33:37.649 --> 01:33:41.833]  I'm told my predecessor called members of Congress and the Senate to demand they block the bill.
[01:33:41.893 --> 01:33:46.176]  He feels a political win will be a political win for me and a political loser for him.
[01:33:46.196 --> 01:33:47.417]  It's not about him, it's not about me.
[01:33:47.237 --> 01:33:52.556]   here it is. I'm told my predecessor called members of Congress in the Senate
[01:33:52.556 --> 01:33:58.076]   to demand they block the bill. He feels political win he viewed as if would be a
[01:33:58.076 --> 01:34:02.197]   political win for me and a political loser for him. It's not about him it's not
[01:34:02.197 --> 01:34:09.476]  about me. I'd be a winner not really.
[01:34:09.476 --> 01:34:18.476]  [crowd noise]
[01:34:18.469 --> 01:34:25.093]  Lincoln, Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal.
[01:34:25.934 --> 01:34:26.514]  That's right.
[01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:31.718]  But how many of thousands of people being killed by legal to her parents?
[01:34:31.818 --> 01:34:34.840]  I say my heart goes out to having lost children myself.
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:36.461]  I understand.
[01:34:37.233 --> 01:34:45.421]  But look, if we change the dynamic at the border, people pay these smugglers $8,000 to get across the border.
[01:34:45.781 --> 01:34:53.308]  Because they know if they get by, if they get by and let into the country, it's six to eight years before they have a hearing.
[01:34:54.569 --> 01:34:56.271]  And it's worth taking the chance of the $8,000.
[01:34:57.472 --> 01:35:10.069]   But, but, if it's only six months, six weeks, The idea is it's highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be able to be kicked out quickly.
[01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:16.973]  In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators.
[01:35:18.173 --> 01:35:23.496]  The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.
[01:35:25.337 --> 01:35:26.197]  Oh, you don't think so?
[01:35:28.658 --> 01:35:29.999]  Oh, you don't like that bill, huh?
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.203]  That conservatives got together and said it was a good bill?
[01:35:35.264 --> 01:35:36.165]  I'll be darned.
[01:35:36.405 --> 01:35:37.186]  That's amazing.
[01:35:38.047 --> 01:35:42.926]   That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers,
[01:35:42.926 --> 01:35:47.326]   100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of two million cases,
[01:35:47.326 --> 01:35:51.886]   4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases
[01:35:51.886 --> 01:35:54.527]  in six months instead of six years now.
[01:36:06.287 --> 01:36:10.846]  Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.
[01:36:10.978 --> 01:36:15.401]  I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom.
[01:36:15.421 --> 01:36:17.703]  And so much more.
[01:36:17.763 --> 01:36:27.271]  Thank you.
[01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:30.213]  My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned.
[01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:32.615]  He's the reason it was overturned.
[01:36:32.755 --> 01:36:33.896]  And he brags about it.
[01:36:35.054 --> 01:36:37.515]  Look at the chaos that has resulted.
[01:36:38.615 --> 01:36:42.636]  Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas.
[01:36:43.436 --> 01:36:46.637]  She's become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition.
[01:36:47.317 --> 01:36:56.420]  Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn't act.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:03.702]  Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed.
[01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:09.687]  What her family got through should have never happened as well, but it's happening to too many others.
[01:37:10.647 --> 01:37:19.911]  There are state laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need.
[01:37:20.891 --> 01:37:26.393]  Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.
[01:37:27.214 --> 01:37:29.534]  My God, what freedom else would you take away?
[01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:34.012]   Look, It's a decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
[01:37:34.052 --> 01:37:45.182]  The Supreme Court majority wrote the following, and with all due respect, Justices, women are not without electoral, electoral power, excuse me, electoral or political power.
[01:37:46.023 --> 01:37:47.585]  You're about to realize just how much.
[01:37:47.404 --> 01:37:54.404]  much you've brought it up. [Applause]
[01:37:55.404 --> 01:37:57.404]  Clearly.
[01:37:57.404 --> 01:38:05.404]  All right, that's enough.
[01:38:04.819 --> 01:38:05.440]  Just turn it off.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.501]  I can't handle any more of it.
[01:38:07.981 --> 01:38:09.742]  All right, Roger, you've got the floor here.
[01:38:10.463 --> 01:38:11.123]  So you just roll.
[01:38:11.143 --> 01:38:11.963]  It's your show right now.
[01:38:11.983 --> 01:38:16.166]  I'm going to listen to you, your take on the State of the Union and where this is going and how we get Trump in.
[01:38:17.607 --> 01:38:19.247]  I've never heard anything quite like that.
[01:38:19.327 --> 01:38:27.672]  First of all, by tradition, State of the Union addresses are supposed to be uplifting, positive, inspirational.
[01:38:28.052 --> 01:38:36.238]   It's an opportunity for the President to cite what, in his view, is going right in the country And also talk about where we could do better.
[01:38:36.799 --> 01:38:43.341]  By and large, presidents try to have a bipartisan cast in their State of the Union addresses.
[01:38:43.901 --> 01:38:53.605]  Never in the history of the country has any president ever called out their predecessor in a State of the Union.
[01:38:53.745 --> 01:38:54.446]  Never happened.
[01:38:54.766 --> 01:39:08.295]   Yet, 13 times in that campaign speech, that angry, bitter harangue, Did Joe Biden make reference to Donald Trump without ever really saying his name?
[01:39:08.736 --> 01:39:10.696]  And then, of course, he just lies.
[01:39:11.256 --> 01:39:18.698]  No, the recent so-called bipartisan border security bill was an open borders bill.
[01:39:19.498 --> 01:39:25.760]  It guaranteed illegal entry by 5,000 illegals a day to about 155,000 a month.
[01:39:30.083 --> 01:39:32.545]  That's just under $2 million a year.
[01:39:32.785 --> 01:39:33.965]  That would have been locked in.
[01:39:34.026 --> 01:39:36.747]  The next president would have had to allow that.
[01:39:37.708 --> 01:39:46.253]  Additionally, the funding in the bill, which Biden implies is to help secure the border, is not for that at all.
[01:39:46.353 --> 01:39:49.115]  It is to process the illegals.
[01:39:49.315 --> 01:40:04.076]   So under no circumstances was the Schumer Lankford bill, a border security bill, and Republicans were correct not to pass it.
[01:40:04.537 --> 01:40:10.622]  This idea that we want to keep the borders open as a campaign issue, that's ridiculous.
[01:40:10.722 --> 01:40:21.692]  I mean, Alex, my wife's son, her only son, my nephew, died of a fentanyl overdose now been four weeks ago.
[01:40:22.873 --> 01:40:27.034]  It is, as you can imagine, it has shocked and horrified our family.
[01:40:27.094 --> 01:40:35.596]  So I've seen firsthand the results, the impact of Joe Biden's open borders policy.
[01:40:35.856 --> 01:40:41.797]  Do you think I want any other family to go through this for the sake of a political issue?
[01:40:42.157 --> 01:40:45.898]  The border is broken, but it wasn't Donald Trump that broke it.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.641]  We don't need a new law.
[01:40:49.121 --> 01:40:51.203]  I'm not even sure we need additional funding.
[01:40:51.663 --> 01:40:53.664]  All we need is the will.
[01:40:54.405 --> 01:40:57.207]  And then you go to the tone of that speech.
[01:40:57.827 --> 01:40:58.287]  Angry.
[01:40:58.928 --> 01:40:59.348]  Bitter.
[01:40:59.968 --> 01:41:00.609]  Partisan.
[01:41:01.029 --> 01:41:07.113]  And still, even working with a teleprompter, he can't get it right.
[01:41:07.133 --> 01:41:08.654]  He keeps misspeaking.
[01:41:08.694 --> 01:41:12.316]  He calls Lincoln Riley, Lincoln Riley.
[01:41:12.637 --> 01:41:19.149]   By the way, hats off to our mutual friend, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for actually calling him out.
[01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:35.775]  Had she not done that, I don't think he would have blurted out the truth, which is thousands of people are being killed or injured by illegals thanks to his open- And by the way, by the way, since you mentioned it, I'm going to interrupt you and play the clips.
[01:41:36.655 --> 01:41:48.190]   We had Biden asked about why He called it illegal that killed Lake and Riley, but it wasn't illegal.
[01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:49.090]  And then Pelosi.
[01:41:49.410 --> 01:41:51.551]  Let's play clip 2 and 11 because Roger raised it.
[01:41:51.591 --> 01:41:54.632]  Here it is.
[01:41:54.672 --> 01:41:58.613]  Do you regret using the word illegal to describe immigrants last night, sir?
[01:41:59.054 --> 01:42:00.274]  Well, not probably.
[01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:03.055]  I don't regret it.
[01:42:03.115 --> 01:42:04.536]  Technically not supposed to be here.
[01:42:07.130 --> 01:42:10.072]  Now, he should have said undocumented, but that's not a big thing.
[01:42:10.452 --> 01:42:10.752]  Okay?
[01:42:11.373 --> 01:42:13.094]  What's the big thing about that?
[01:42:13.954 --> 01:42:15.516]  I actually wasn't even going to ask about that.
[01:42:15.556 --> 01:42:19.118]  I was just going to ask more about the moment, but you do think that he should have said undocumented?
[01:42:19.138 --> 01:42:19.978]  That wasn't going to be my question.
[01:42:19.998 --> 01:42:22.260]  Well, we usually say undocumented.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.204]  They're masters of mind control, masters of language, making us comport them.
[01:42:28.244 --> 01:42:29.905]  No, they're illegal aliens.
[01:42:30.265 --> 01:42:30.806]  They're worse.
[01:42:30.846 --> 01:42:31.746]  They're invaders.
[01:42:32.026 --> 01:42:33.607]  And a bunch of them are kidnapped kids.
[01:42:33.667 --> 01:42:34.248]  Roger Stone.
[01:42:35.974 --> 01:42:37.094]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:39.115]  It's about being politically correct.
[01:42:39.315 --> 01:42:42.896]  After all, we don't want to hurt the feelings of these people.
[01:42:43.276 --> 01:42:49.538]  Yeah, don't hurt the feelings of the murderer that kidnapped and raped and bashed the brains out of a young woman!
[01:42:51.019 --> 01:42:55.480]  Well, and I think we have to look exactly who is coming into this country.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.961]  These are not, by and large, families.
[01:42:59.301 --> 01:43:00.902]  They're not, by and large, children.
[01:43:00.982 --> 01:43:01.942]  Military age men.
[01:43:03.783 --> 01:43:06.364]  From the Middle East and China particularly.
[01:43:07.084 --> 01:43:16.727]  And that we now know, and this is even more shocking, they're not just coming over our southern border or our northern border, they're flying them in.
[01:43:17.168 --> 01:43:24.510]  340,000 illegals were flown into the country first class by the Biden administration.
[01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:27.771]  This defies comprehension.
[01:43:28.491 --> 01:43:34.455]   For them to say that that is not their policy, Or for Biden to totally shift gears.
[01:43:34.595 --> 01:43:36.716]  I think this was, I don't know, two and a half weeks ago.
[01:43:36.996 --> 01:43:45.778]  He said the border's not secure after insisting to his own Homeland Security Secretary and his spokeswoman that it has been secure.
[01:43:46.039 --> 01:43:46.979]  That's a major shift.
[01:43:47.019 --> 01:43:48.219]  Well, Roger, it's worse than that.
[01:43:48.279 --> 01:43:52.400]  As you know, he told them, when I win the election or steal it, immediately surge the border.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:53.681]  We got a bunch of clips of him saying that.
[01:43:54.361 --> 01:44:00.564]  So he does this, he pays them to come here, and it's the same thing with Governor Hochul and the Mayor of New York.
[01:44:00.884 --> 01:44:03.665]  They act like they're against it, but they're the ones running it.
[01:44:03.825 --> 01:44:05.726]  The public sees right through it, don't they, Roger?
[01:44:07.427 --> 01:44:08.508]  They really, really do.
[01:44:08.928 --> 01:44:10.709]  Alex, there's one other thing I want to bring up.
[01:44:10.909 --> 01:44:16.931]  You may think this is odd, but you have a new product, Nitric Boost.
[01:44:17.051 --> 01:44:20.233]  This is one of the greatest InfoWars products I have ever used.
[01:44:20.753 --> 01:44:28.367]   Now, nitric oxide is normally produced in your veins and arteries.
[01:44:28.367 --> 01:44:33.967]   And as you get older, the natural production of it decreases.
[01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:40.528]   And it is absolutely essential for a healthy heart, healthy vascular system, and overall
[01:44:40.528 --> 01:44:41.528]  health.
[01:44:41.528 --> 01:44:45.608]  But beyond that, what I've found, this stuff is amazing.
[01:44:45.608 --> 01:44:51.887]   It has given me a natural boost in energy like I've never had before.
[01:44:51.887 --> 01:44:55.168]  So it's a great, great product, Nitrog Boost.
[01:44:55.168 --> 01:44:57.568]  I really, really recommend it.
[01:44:57.568 --> 01:45:00.847]  As you know, I'm putting in ridiculously long hours.
[01:45:00.847 --> 01:45:06.367]   I won't get back to my own home tonight until well after midnight because I'm speaking to
[01:45:06.367 --> 01:45:07.887]  this Republican group.
[01:45:07.887 --> 01:45:09.327]  I find this product amazing.
[01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:18.561]   It gives me not only an overall sense of well-being, it promotes immunity, it's a rich, rich antioxidant,
[01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:22.281]   but I also know it's helping my heart, helping my vascular system.
[01:45:22.281 --> 01:45:24.601]  By the way, Roger, I had no idea you were gonna do this.
[01:45:24.601 --> 01:45:25.760]  I didn't know you were taking nitric boost.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.961]  I know you're a fan of the products.
[01:45:26.961 --> 01:45:30.760]   Dr. Judy Mikovits has said it's one of the best ones out there, it cleans out the blood,
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.361]   the arteries, the capillaries, so good with all the stuff that's going on
[01:45:33.361 --> 01:45:34.280]  in the environment right now.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.201]  I didn't know you got some.
[01:45:35.201 --> 01:45:40.961]   You know the side effect, not that we need it, But I mean, I've tried it, you know, I hit 40, I'm 50 now.
[01:45:41.046 --> 01:45:43.488]  My doctor's like, here, have a bottle of Viagra, have a bottle of Cialis.
[01:45:43.929 --> 01:45:45.430]  Not that I need it, but it's a little fun.
[01:45:45.871 --> 01:45:47.533]  You know, my wife's like, wow, you're really excited.
[01:45:48.254 --> 01:45:49.375]  It's like I'm 18 again.
[01:45:49.915 --> 01:45:56.302]  So, you know, Darth Vader, that's the name of the, I'm not being sarcastic, is just a little more robust, a little bit happier.
[01:45:56.983 --> 01:46:01.185]  And what I found with Nitric Boost, which I take every day, is it's like I'm 18 all the time.
[01:46:01.565 --> 01:46:07.227]  For me, it's not even designed for that, but it shows what it does with your vascularity.
[01:46:07.607 --> 01:46:14.310]  If people will just take it, almost everyone has the response of the Johnson Department really seeing what's going on.
[01:46:16.051 --> 01:46:17.531]  Yeah, it's an amazing product.
[01:46:17.611 --> 01:46:21.993]  It's not like those energy drinks where you get a spike in energy.
[01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:23.874]  Look, I always liked TurboForce.
[01:46:23.934 --> 01:46:24.414]  I used it.
[01:46:24.875 --> 01:46:26.877]  For years, I still use it on occasion.
[01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:31.720]  But this, I think, is more subtle, but also more powerful.
[01:46:32.681 --> 01:46:34.062]  It's a great, great product.
[01:46:34.142 --> 01:46:35.463]  I want to congratulate you on it.
[01:46:36.064 --> 01:46:38.706]  Stimulants are great, but they only boost what's already there.
[01:46:38.766 --> 01:46:40.648]  This goes right to the core of the energy.
[01:46:41.108 --> 01:46:42.529]  So does the Next Level Financial Energy.
[01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:43.550]  Well, thanks for the plug, Roger.
[01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:46.872]  Didn't know you were going to do that, but so you like Nitric Boost?
[01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:50.075]  It's a great product, and I had to bring it up.
[01:46:50.836 --> 01:46:52.197]  It's also at a great price.
[01:46:53.344 --> 01:46:54.289]  There are competitors.
[01:46:54.691 --> 01:46:56.500]  This is, I think, the purest form.
[01:46:57.054 --> 01:46:59.196]  And it's really a great product.
[01:46:59.336 --> 01:46:59.856]  No, you're right.
[01:46:59.916 --> 01:47:01.237]  It's a big, it's a big hot thing.
[01:47:01.257 --> 01:47:02.058]  Been hot for years.
[01:47:02.118 --> 01:47:03.139]  And that's why we're doing it.
[01:47:03.179 --> 01:47:05.860]  We always bring you high quality one at a good price.
[01:47:05.881 --> 01:47:08.042]  You can find stuff just as good out there, folks.
[01:47:08.102 --> 01:47:08.562]  Roger said it.
[01:47:08.582 --> 01:47:08.903]  It's true.
[01:47:09.143 --> 01:47:09.783]  Just get it from us.
[01:47:09.803 --> 01:47:10.344]  We want to support us.
[01:47:10.664 --> 01:47:11.324]  All right, Roger.
[01:47:11.404 --> 01:47:13.566]  In closing, we've got about 10 minutes left with you.
[01:47:14.387 --> 01:47:16.248]  And I've got so many questions I could ask.
[01:47:16.308 --> 01:47:19.831]  But just, wow, we are only eight and a half months out from this.
[01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:21.632]  I've never felt such anticipation.
[01:47:21.652 --> 01:47:22.913]  You can cut the tension with a knife.
[01:47:23.313 --> 01:47:25.735]  What else is on the great Roger Stone's radar?
[01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:32.832]  Well, I'm very happy about this complete sea change at the Republican National Committee.
[01:47:33.032 --> 01:47:42.755]  Now, most people don't know this, and it's a little technical, a little wonky, but... Yeah, we got Ronna McDaniel out, we got Trump's daughter-in-law in.
[01:47:42.795 --> 01:47:43.755]  I mean, this is big.
[01:47:43.995 --> 01:47:44.876]  This is MAGA.
[01:47:45.196 --> 01:47:49.857]  I saw a meme of, like, MAGA is the big elephant, and the Republicans are the baby elephant.
[01:47:50.137 --> 01:47:54.379]  The neocons and all them are being... the Mitt Romneys are finally being swept away.
[01:47:54.399 --> 01:47:54.919]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:47:56.274 --> 01:47:57.154]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:47:57.354 --> 01:48:09.617]  See, under the law, the Republican National Committee, the actual national party, can perform certain functions in coordination with the presidential campaign of the nominee.
[01:48:09.977 --> 01:48:11.777]  They're the only ones who can.
[01:48:12.737 --> 01:48:24.840]  So, get certain voter ID, voter registration, voter turnout programs, in coordination with the presidential campaign, can only be paid for by the Republican National Committee.
[01:48:25.342 --> 01:48:40.277]  The problem was that under the leadership of Ronna Romney McDaniel, the party was... Alright, I'm surprised for 48 minutes driving through Florida that Roger's phone stayed as good as it did.
[01:48:40.898 --> 01:48:42.319]  I expected this quite early.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.362]  Let's hang up the phone, call Roger back.
[01:48:46.623 --> 01:48:48.465]  And obviously, it's just bigger than...
[01:48:49.349 --> 01:48:51.169]  The old Republican establishment is being swept away.
[01:48:51.889 --> 01:48:59.751]  Now the actual Republican Party money that Ronald McDaniel would give to failed causes and wouldn't spend on key things will go to Trump.
[01:49:01.331 --> 01:49:05.292]  But I'm telling you, folks, I saw the meme I meant to send to the crew today to show.
[01:49:05.312 --> 01:49:06.692]  I should have done that.
[01:49:06.712 --> 01:49:08.292]  I should have retweeted it, reposted it.
[01:49:08.332 --> 01:49:10.153]  But it was like this big giant elephant.
[01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:11.833]  It's a real photo, big mama elephant.
[01:49:12.273 --> 01:49:13.513]  And it says MAGA.
[01:49:14.153 --> 01:49:16.474]  And then you've got the little baby elephant is the Republicans.
[01:49:17.113 --> 01:49:18.073]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:49:18.114 --> 01:49:22.035]  We are successfully taking over one of the two parties in the country.
[01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.557]  And it's exciting.
[01:49:25.637 --> 01:49:37.783]  So they think they can intimidate the leaders of the resistance, the Alex Joneses, the Tucker Carlsons, the Roger Stones, the Donald Trumps, and that we'll just crap ourselves.
[01:49:37.823 --> 01:49:38.864]  They don't get we're fighters.
[01:49:41.148 --> 01:49:47.693]  And so that's where I'm at, is that they think intimidation works because they think we're sociopaths like them.
[01:49:48.474 --> 01:49:49.615]  It actually excites me.
[01:49:49.675 --> 01:49:51.656]  I'm not a masochist, but I am now.
[01:49:52.357 --> 01:49:53.318]  I'm 50, folks.
[01:49:54.058 --> 01:49:56.420]  It's crazy to be 50, but I've done so much in my life.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.842]  I'm not bragging, but man, I was a man at like 14.
[01:49:59.282 --> 01:50:00.803]  I was dating college women at 14.
[01:50:01.644 --> 01:50:02.365]  I looked like I was 20.
[01:50:03.225 --> 01:50:09.630]  And I had a job when I was 12, and I was dehorning cattle and lassoing and roping stuff when I was 10.
[01:50:10.851 --> 01:50:16.155]  And I just, I've been a man a long time, but I am so proud of America waking up and the world waking up.
[01:50:16.175 --> 01:50:17.877]  I'm so proud of our associations.
[01:50:18.457 --> 01:50:21.059]  The best part of this fight is I get to find out who's real and who's not.
[01:50:21.479 --> 01:50:29.166]  So these people think messing with my family and messing with me and torturing us makes us roll over.
[01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:34.630]  But my mother and my father in the last month came to me and they said, you know, they're threatening us.
[01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:35.370]  They're coming after us.
[01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:36.812]  They've done horrible things to us behind the scenes.
[01:50:37.792 --> 01:50:39.394]  They said, we want you to get more hardcore.
[01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:44.716]  Now my dad 20-30 years ago said, you need to back off, you're too hardcore.
[01:50:44.736 --> 01:50:46.316]  10 years ago he said, I was wrong, you're right.
[01:50:47.777 --> 01:50:48.997]  5 years ago he was fully behind me.
[01:50:49.657 --> 01:50:50.638]  I'm on a cult.
[01:50:50.778 --> 01:50:52.038]  I don't tell my dad what to do, he tells me what to do.
[01:50:52.378 --> 01:50:54.739]  My dad is more hardcore than I am now.
[01:50:55.119 --> 01:51:00.121]  And my mother is like a Spartan woman saying, come home with your shield or on it.
[01:51:01.551 --> 01:51:04.653]  And Roger, you got cut off, and I want you to speak to our fighting spirit.
[01:51:05.093 --> 01:51:09.937]  Why does the left think intimidating and attacking and bullying makes us go away?
[01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:12.038]  Haven't they figured out what makes us fight that harder?
[01:51:12.378 --> 01:51:18.422]  And just like I just said, the American people see that in Trump, and they know they're being attacked, and they're not backing down.
[01:51:18.983 --> 01:51:23.706]  America was asleep before, and the globalists thought the bullying made them submit.
[01:51:23.726 --> 01:51:24.627]  They were asleep.
[01:51:25.447 --> 01:51:31.312]  Now they're awake and being punched in the nose does not make us run away and get in a fetal position, Roger.
[01:51:31.632 --> 01:51:32.933]  Can you speak to the fighting spirit?
[01:51:33.994 --> 01:51:34.274]  Yeah.
[01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:48.266]  You know, Alex, every time I start thinking about that and thinking about whether life would be so much easier now if we just ran from the fight, if we just went dark and stopped fighting for the country, stopped speaking out about what's happening.
[01:51:48.606 --> 01:51:54.811]  And then I think about those men at Valley Forge and I think what they went through in that bitter winter.
[01:51:55.733 --> 01:52:05.980]  Preceding the great victory in the American Revolution, with nothing to eat, with no shoes, in the bitter, bitter cold of a frigid Pennsylvania.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.043]  And then I look at what you and I have gone through and I realize it is all worth it.
[01:52:11.163 --> 01:52:20.409]  The freedom, the future, the greatness of America, the freedom for our children and grandchildren, it's all worth it.
[01:52:20.509 --> 01:52:32.780]   So yeah, when I had my near-death experience, When they wanted to send me to prison for seven to nine years, even though I'd done nothing wrong because I refused to bear false witness against Donald Trump.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:39.344]  After that experience, my children, my grandchildren said, you know, Pop, Grandpa, maybe it's time to hang it up.
[01:52:39.745 --> 01:52:41.466]  Maybe it's time to just go dark.
[01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:46.229]  You could maybe write some historical books and go to the beach and lay low.
[01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:48.011]  Alex, I couldn't do it.
[01:52:48.331 --> 01:52:49.452]  I couldn't do it for a day.
[01:52:50.433 --> 01:52:54.456]  We are now in the existential fight for America.
[01:52:54.737 --> 01:52:59.420]  We will either succeed or we will fail, but we will not quit.
[01:52:59.561 --> 01:53:02.623]  We will not fail to give it every... And that's it, Roger.
[01:53:02.703 --> 01:53:05.245]  We are blessed to be in this position historically.
[01:53:05.886 --> 01:53:08.168]  We should be thanking our lucky stars.
[01:53:08.528 --> 01:53:12.191]  We got a chance to literally redo what George Washington did again.
[01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:14.233]  We are preparing the whole future right now.
[01:53:16.334 --> 01:53:19.377]  I honestly believe that my life was spared for a purpose.
[01:53:20.181 --> 01:53:29.987]  I believe that the good Lord stepped in, in this horrific effort to destroy me and save my life, not to go to the beach and live a life... But you know why, Roger?
[01:53:30.047 --> 01:53:35.770]  You weren't perfect, and you admit you weren't perfect, but you weren't evil, and you had courage, and God hates cowards.
[01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:36.671]  You know that right, Roger?
[01:53:36.951 --> 01:53:38.912]  God loves you, Roger, because you're not a coward!
[01:53:40.773 --> 01:53:41.914]  That's why we're still here.
[01:53:41.934 --> 01:53:46.477]  That's why we're talking on the radio on a Saturday afternoon on the Internet.
[01:53:47.385 --> 01:53:48.705]  I'm getting the word out there.
[01:53:48.745 --> 01:53:50.346]  This is the fight.
[01:53:50.366 --> 01:53:52.726]  It's not between liberals and conservatives.
[01:53:53.106 --> 01:53:55.246]  It's not between Republicans and Democrats.
[01:53:56.227 --> 01:53:57.927]  This is something much bigger.
[01:53:58.267 --> 01:54:00.787]  It is an epic struggle between dark and light.
[01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:03.948]  It is an epic struggle between good and evil.
[01:54:04.268 --> 01:54:07.769]  It is an epic struggle between the godly and the godless.
[01:54:08.009 --> 01:54:15.110]  Alex, if we fail, this country will step off into a thousand years of darkness.
[01:54:16.344 --> 01:54:20.347]  This is nothing less than Armageddon.
[01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:35.258]  I think it empowers me to know, in every great battle in the Bible, the Lord's forces are always overwhelmingly outnumbered, but they are always victorious.
[01:54:35.639 --> 01:54:39.942]  And so, with the grace of God, shall we be victorious?
[01:54:40.302 --> 01:54:42.264]  But we must not flinch.
[01:54:42.404 --> 01:54:43.865]  We must not quit.
[01:54:44.306 --> 01:54:48.949]  And folks, you said it earlier, we need the support of the people.
[01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:50.690]  You and I can't do this alone.
[01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:55.572]  People need to go to InfoWars and load up on great products like Nitric Boost.
[01:54:55.973 --> 01:55:04.437]  Go to TheStoneZone.com, buy my books, buy a t-shirt, buy anything there, or contribute to my family support fund.
[01:55:04.457 --> 01:55:08.380]  Because we're the champions in the folk and we're the representatives of the people.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:14.102]   So, in closing, I know the Texas Revolution had it, but so did the first revolution in 1776.
[01:55:14.302 --> 01:55:15.863]  There was a flag.
[01:55:15.883 --> 01:55:16.723]  It was like a tree.
[01:55:17.123 --> 01:55:18.384]  It was appealed to heaven.
[01:55:18.424 --> 01:55:19.204]  Guys, there it is.
[01:55:19.404 --> 01:55:20.065]  They're so fast.
[01:55:20.665 --> 01:55:21.365]  Appealed to heaven.
[01:55:22.125 --> 01:55:25.847]  And folks, when you dial into that, that's the only thing that can override the enemy.
[01:55:26.227 --> 01:55:27.247]  And it will override the enemy.
[01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:35.850]   You've got to say, I know I'm an imperfect vessel in your presence, because when you open up the gate to God, you feel pathetic because it's dirty rags compared to Him.
[01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:38.231]  But you must open the appeal to Heaven.
[01:55:38.611 --> 01:55:42.372]  And Roger, I didn't tell you I was going to do this, but just do it.
[01:55:42.952 --> 01:55:43.812]  Roger's never done this before.
[01:55:44.192 --> 01:55:46.173]  Roger, lead us in a short prayer, please.
[01:55:47.493 --> 01:55:47.793]  All right.
[01:55:47.993 --> 01:55:49.053]  I'm happy to do so.
[01:55:49.073 --> 01:55:51.814]  Dear Heavenly Father, please hear our prayer.
[01:55:52.414 --> 01:55:53.955]  We appeal to you for justice.
[01:55:54.235 --> 01:55:56.355]  We appeal to you for wisdom.
[01:55:56.556 --> 01:55:58.136]  We appeal to you for guidance.
[01:55:58.709 --> 01:56:03.092]  We appeal to you to strengthen us in the battle ahead.
[01:56:03.653 --> 01:56:05.394]  We do battle for you, Lord.
[01:56:05.474 --> 01:56:06.715]  We do battle for good.
[01:56:07.155 --> 01:56:11.298]  We do battle for our children, our grandchildren, our families, our future.
[01:56:11.619 --> 01:56:13.080]  We're proud of our heritage.
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:16.942]  We're proud of everything you, Lord, you alone have given us.
[01:56:17.343 --> 01:56:20.985]  And we realize that if you are with us, none can be against us.
[01:56:21.045 --> 01:56:23.507]  So God, strengthen us in this moment.
[01:56:24.068 --> 01:56:29.228]   gave us the wisdom and the courage to see this fight through to victory.
[01:56:29.228 --> 01:56:32.188]  In your name, in your mighty name, Amen.
[01:56:32.188 --> 01:56:33.188]  Amen.
[01:56:33.188 --> 01:56:39.827]   I asked the crew to pull up, I forget the exact Bible verse, but I think it was Paul
[01:56:39.827 --> 01:56:45.247]   said I forget, "We fight not against flesh and blood, but we wrestle against principalities
[01:56:45.247 --> 01:56:46.708]  and the powers of the air."
[01:56:47.111 --> 01:56:47.491]  There it is.
[01:56:47.831 --> 01:56:55.794]  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:56:56.234 --> 01:56:57.134]  This is real.
[01:56:57.194 --> 01:56:58.434]  They're coming for our children.
[01:56:58.754 --> 01:56:59.875]  They're coming for us all.
[01:57:00.734 --> 01:57:03.076]  So it's not like special to fight evil.
[01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:05.978]  You must fight it if you love God.
[01:57:06.038 --> 01:57:07.419]  You must stand against it.
[01:57:07.459 --> 01:57:08.800]  You must resist it.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.362]  And it's a great honor to be persecuted.
[01:57:11.402 --> 01:57:14.764]  But I just want people to awaken and realize the fight is now.
[01:57:14.784 --> 01:57:19.568]  And we are in the center of this fight today.
[01:57:19.968 --> 01:57:22.450]  Roger, we got two minutes till you're leaving us.
[01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:23.410]  Closing comments.
[01:57:25.192 --> 01:57:28.014]  Alex, I think we have summed this thing up.
[01:57:28.334 --> 01:57:32.366]   The folks who either stand with us And if they do, we will be victorious.
[01:57:32.386 --> 01:57:34.326]  I know you'll never quit.
[01:57:34.586 --> 01:57:35.286]  I'll never quit.
[01:57:35.306 --> 01:57:37.967]  It was great to see you with Tucker Carlson the other night.
[01:57:38.767 --> 01:57:43.729]  It's amazing how many millions and millions of people he's now reaching.
[01:57:43.809 --> 01:57:48.970]  Millions more than he ever reached when he was merely at Fox News.
[01:57:49.711 --> 01:57:50.751]  That is a blessing.
[01:57:51.091 --> 01:57:53.732]  Everything that happened to him was a blessing.
[01:57:53.852 --> 01:58:00.311]   So I thank you for having me, and I want to let everybody out there In the InfoWars community.
[01:58:00.671 --> 01:58:12.435]  Have a blessed Sunday, but please remember to pray for the safety of our president, Donald Trump, and pray for ultimate victory for him and for our nation.
[01:58:12.735 --> 01:58:13.415]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:14.175 --> 01:58:15.576]  RogerStoneZone.com.
[01:58:15.596 --> 01:58:16.296]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:58:17.916 --> 01:58:18.477]  God bless you.
[01:58:21.998 --> 01:58:25.619]  I have not talked about on air yet what's happening behind the scenes.
[01:58:29.574 --> 01:58:35.579]  Because it's not time to do it yet for a lot of reasons, but I've been very honest with the crew.
[01:58:35.599 --> 01:58:41.964]  And as Americans, we tend to think we're still living in a free country.
[01:58:42.024 --> 01:58:42.384]  You don't.
[01:58:43.926 --> 01:58:47.809]  And the type of deceptive people we deal with is next level.
[01:58:48.810 --> 01:58:51.452]  But I believe in the power of prayer.
[01:58:51.492 --> 01:58:52.132]  I don't believe.
[01:58:52.352 --> 01:58:53.033]  I rely on it.
[01:58:53.133 --> 01:58:53.553]  I know it.
[01:58:55.335 --> 01:58:57.877]  So InfoWars is meant to continue on.
[01:58:59.653 --> 01:59:01.314]  Because they're weeks away from shutting it down.
[01:59:02.534 --> 01:59:06.116]  And maybe next week, maybe even maybe tomorrow, I'm going to tell you what's been happening.
[01:59:08.317 --> 01:59:10.338]  But I've got to get all the documents.
[01:59:10.498 --> 01:59:12.199]  I'm so busy being on air and doing everything else.
[01:59:12.739 --> 01:59:14.220]  I got to get all the documents together.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.980]  I got to be ready to explain all this.
[01:59:16.641 --> 01:59:17.541]  But it's horrible.
[01:59:18.802 --> 01:59:21.783]  But it's what we should expect because we're taking on the devil, folks.
[01:59:22.683 --> 01:59:23.023]  All right.
[01:59:23.964 --> 01:59:28.401]   And The orders have been given to take us off the air.
[01:59:28.922 --> 01:59:29.943]  It won't take me off the air.
[01:59:30.303 --> 01:59:31.083]  It'll hurt the crew.
[01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:32.364]  And this is a great place.
[01:59:32.404 --> 01:59:33.325]  They see it as a symbol.
[01:59:34.065 --> 01:59:35.006]  But it's like Darth Vader.
[01:59:35.026 --> 01:59:38.268]  In fact, pull up Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi fight.
[01:59:38.288 --> 01:59:38.809]  I want to play that.
[01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:40.950]  Because it's literally that.
[01:59:43.172 --> 01:59:48.075]  They don't even get second, third, fourth level order events.
[01:59:48.636 --> 01:59:48.936]  We do.
[01:59:51.912 --> 02:00:02.378]  And so I know personally with my message and what I'm going to be able to do when they shut InfoWars down that we'll be even more effective in ways.
[02:00:02.879 --> 02:00:07.161]  But I'm loyal to the crew and it'll be a victory at one level so I can't let that happen.
[02:00:07.682 --> 02:00:12.905]  So I'm fighting against treachery you wouldn't believe.
[02:00:12.925 --> 02:00:17.914]   The Justice Department and the CIA It's all going to come out.
[02:00:17.934 --> 02:00:18.954]  There'll be congressional hearings.
[02:00:19.695 --> 02:00:23.518]  It's good because when this all turns and it's turning, it'll bring them down.
[02:00:24.679 --> 02:00:28.882]  But the level of the persecution is spectacular.
[02:00:30.143 --> 02:00:32.505]  And the level of deception is amazing.
[02:00:33.746 --> 02:00:39.211]  And you just need to know that while I'm here with you, you shouldn't take one of these shows for granted.
[02:00:41.112 --> 02:00:43.114]  And I don't say that in a pompous way.
[02:00:43.134 --> 02:00:46.557]  I'm saying we're doing things the enemy can't stand.
[02:00:47.332 --> 02:00:49.713]  That irrevocably damage their operations.
[02:00:51.773 --> 02:00:53.114]  I've seen the cut of their jib.
[02:00:54.214 --> 02:00:55.154]  They've seen the cut of mine.
[02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.815]  And what we do is destroy tyrants.
[02:00:59.536 --> 02:01:00.636]  I'm a tyrant killer.
[02:01:01.596 --> 02:01:02.877]  I was raised up to do this.
[02:01:03.617 --> 02:01:04.217]  It's all God.
[02:01:05.278 --> 02:01:07.458]  And I have total confidence in the mission.
[02:01:09.279 --> 02:01:10.259]  We're going to save the planet.
[02:01:10.279 --> 02:01:12.740]  We're going to go interplanetary.
[02:01:13.712 --> 02:01:18.457]  We're gonna defeat this and if I gotta get hurt to get that done, it's an honor to do it.
[02:01:19.398 --> 02:01:25.765]  But I need to be honest with you and let you know that it's bad.
[02:01:26.926 --> 02:01:36.743]   Because they don't just threaten me, they threaten my family and I'm so proud of my father and mother When your mother tells you that, there's power in that.
[02:01:36.583 --> 02:01:42.262]   on the scenes and I thought when they attacked them and threatened them that they wouldn't be this strong
[02:01:42.262 --> 02:01:46.983]   and instead they said, "Come home with your shields "or on it."
[02:01:46.983 --> 02:01:52.383]   Three weeks ago my mother said, she's a big historian, she's got a degree in it, she looked at me and she says,
[02:01:52.383 --> 02:01:58.163]   "You know the Spartans saying, "'Come home with your shield or on it.'"
[02:01:58.163 --> 02:02:04.622]   When your mother tells you that, there's power in that, she says, "I don't care."
[02:02:06.503 --> 02:02:10.022]   care about the PIs and the harassment and getting bumped at the grocery store.
[02:02:10.244 --> 02:02:12.665]  They don't care about the lawsuits, the attacks, and the death threats.
[02:02:13.246 --> 02:02:16.667]  And your mother tells you, I want you to take these people on.
[02:02:16.687 --> 02:02:23.770]  Because my parents were never looking for this fight.
[02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:27.171]  But now they're ready for it.
[02:02:28.631 --> 02:02:40.169]   And my family, my family, mine, my people, You are behind me, and God's behind me.
[02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:45.992]  And so I promise our enemies this, you're gonna get my full attack.
[02:02:48.293 --> 02:02:49.734]  Because you're gonna get out of our way.
[02:02:50.414 --> 02:02:58.938]  We're gonna save civilization, we're gonna defeat you, and we're gonna stop you, because God's behind us, and that's why you hate me, because you know I'm so real.
[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.871]  I'm so real.
[02:03:01.891 --> 02:03:03.733]  I'm the opposite of you.
[02:03:03.753 --> 02:03:08.998]  I'm the opposite of you frauds that see people as scum that you want to hurt.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:12.681]  Good, decent children you want to destroy.
[02:03:13.923 --> 02:03:20.689]  I'm so blessed to be in the fulcrum of this fight and to be chosen to stand against you.
[02:03:20.789 --> 02:03:21.950]  It is a blessing.
[02:03:22.291 --> 02:03:25.474]  These attacks are a gift.
[02:03:28.787 --> 02:03:31.129]  I just want to complete the task.
[02:03:31.789 --> 02:03:32.690]  I want to stay true.
[02:03:32.710 --> 02:03:37.933]  I want to deliver the death blow and God's giving it to us.
[02:03:38.213 --> 02:03:45.843]   It's so All of the top talk show hosts are anti-globalists now because the people want freedom.
[02:03:46.583 --> 02:03:52.084]  And all of the top talk show hosts tell me this broadcast is the North Star.
[02:03:53.044 --> 02:03:59.525]  I'm so blessed because of all of you supporting us and everything you did and your word of mouth and things you thought didn't mean anything.
[02:03:59.946 --> 02:04:03.346]  You telling somebody about the show, you buying a product, you praying for us.
[02:04:03.766 --> 02:04:04.826]  You don't think God's real?
[02:04:04.846 --> 02:04:05.547]  Yeah, God's real.
[02:04:05.587 --> 02:04:06.007]  God's real.
[02:04:06.667 --> 02:04:07.647]  And you said those prayers.
[02:04:09.366 --> 02:04:10.146]  You did those things.
[02:04:11.486 --> 02:04:14.007]  And God is going to deliver us.
[02:04:15.687 --> 02:04:20.368]  And they might kill me or put me in prison and try to make you feel like we're weak.
[02:04:20.648 --> 02:04:23.108]  No, I chose this path.
[02:04:24.449 --> 02:04:25.949]  I chose to take on Goliath.
[02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:34.390]  I put myself on the field because I believed in you and I wanted to inspire you because you're beautiful and you're amazing.
[02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:40.009]   Whether you've got beautiful black skin or beautiful pink skin, Or look at a tomato like me.
[02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:41.691]  It's okay.
[02:04:43.272 --> 02:04:44.473]  Because we're all made by God.
[02:04:45.054 --> 02:04:48.037]  And we are eternal spirits that they can never destroy.
[02:04:48.057 --> 02:04:50.799]  All right.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.821]  Play the Obi-Wan Kenobi Club.
[02:04:53.402 --> 02:04:54.643]  Then I'll add a few final things.
[02:04:55.123 --> 02:04:56.505]  And then we'll end this live transmission.
[02:04:56.945 --> 02:05:01.810]  And then we'll loop it at InfoWars.com forward slash show until 4 p.m.
[02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:25.650]   I'll see him tomorrow when I go live for the Sunday transmission.
[02:05:26.328 --> 02:05:27.829]  We meet again at last.
[02:05:29.129 --> 02:05:30.290]  The circle is now complete.
[02:05:31.071 --> 02:05:32.952]  When I left you, I was but the learner.
[02:05:33.132 --> 02:05:34.933]  Now I am the master.
[02:05:35.333 --> 02:05:37.333]  Only a monster of evil, Doc.
[02:05:37.333 --> 02:05:59.333]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[02:05:59.542 --> 02:06:00.562]  You can't win, Darth.
[02:06:01.403 --> 02:06:05.545]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:06:05.565 --> 02:06:11.648]  You should not have come back.
[02:06:11.688 --> 02:06:13.688]  You should not have come back.
[02:06:13.688 --> 02:06:15.688]  You should not have come back.
[02:06:15.688 --> 02:06:18.688]  [Music]
[02:06:18.688 --> 02:06:21.688]  [Music]
[02:06:21.688 --> 02:06:27.688]  [Music]
[02:06:27.688 --> 02:06:33.688]  [Music]
[02:06:33.688 --> 02:06:39.688]  [Music]
[02:06:39.688 --> 02:06:47.688]  [Music]
[02:06:48.688 --> 02:06:51.688]  Ben?
[02:06:51.688 --> 02:06:54.688]  [Music]
[02:06:54.688 --> 02:07:02.688]  [Music]
[02:07:01.206 --> 02:07:06.630]  InfoWars has now reached that moment.
[02:07:07.671 --> 02:07:08.271]  We're gonna win.
[02:07:09.552 --> 02:07:11.254]  All the scum will be destroyed.
[02:07:12.675 --> 02:07:17.675]  They will all drown in lakes of their own making.
[02:07:17.675 --> 02:07:37.675]   As we speak, they're aborting children by the millions, chopping the genitals off of the hundreds of thousands.
[02:07:38.262 --> 02:07:39.463]  Their hell is upon us.
[02:07:41.105 --> 02:07:45.508]  All right, I wanted to play this clip because Bernie Sanders is a real piece of garbage.
[02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:49.112]  He didn't have a paying job until he was 40 years old.
[02:07:49.132 --> 02:07:49.692]  You can look it up.
[02:07:50.653 --> 02:07:54.336]  He has mansions and palaces and drives $200,000 sports cars.
[02:07:57.113 --> 02:08:05.758]  That he tells you America sucks and capitalism is bad and you shouldn't go to the grocery store and have 30 choices in deodorant, he said.
[02:08:06.619 --> 02:08:11.382]  He wants you to stay on the breadlines like the Russians did.
[02:08:13.843 --> 02:08:17.325]  And trying to invoke the cult of you wearing a mask and that fear.
[02:08:17.745 --> 02:08:19.707]  He went to the State of the Union Thursday night.
[02:08:20.745 --> 02:08:26.908]  And he sat there for an hour shaking hands and laughing and wiping his face, got the videos, not worried about a virus.
[02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:37.253]  And then once he knew the State of the Union was happening, he put it on for the TV.
[02:08:39.814 --> 02:08:40.835]  And that's a Rosetta Stone.
[02:08:42.935 --> 02:08:44.516]  That story shows you everything you want to know.
[02:08:45.176 --> 02:08:52.280]  He thinks you're so dumb you won't watch the pre footage of everybody coming in and glad handing and the political parasites and all of it.
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:53.941]  Him for an hour not wearing a mask.
[02:08:54.421 --> 02:09:05.535]   And then when it's showtime, when he thinks he'll be on TV, he puts the mask on and Literally hundreds of millions of views on X. It trended the last two days.
[02:09:05.975 --> 02:09:13.041]  Bernie Sanders laughing and joking when he doesn't think he's on TV and then he puts the mask on.
[02:09:13.081 --> 02:09:14.402]  It's all a fraud.
[02:09:15.993 --> 02:09:17.254]  It's all a hoax.
[02:09:17.374 --> 02:09:19.835]  It's all a person that wants to make you scared.
[02:09:19.895 --> 02:09:24.356]  It's a predator that hates you and hates your family.
[02:09:24.757 --> 02:09:27.218]  And you see him and you know who he is.
[02:09:27.378 --> 02:09:31.217]   Roll the video of him not wearing the mask and then putting it on for TV.
[02:09:31.217 --> 02:09:38.137]  Not wearing his little mask he masked.
[02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:48.138]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:09:41.752 --> 02:09:47.254]  Because he doesn't even think, wait, they'll see me not wearing it, but I'll wear it later.
[02:09:49.334 --> 02:09:50.655]  They think you're not watching.
[02:09:53.295 --> 02:09:56.536]  They think you're stupid, but you're not stupid, are you?
[02:09:57.457 --> 02:09:58.177]  No, you're not.
[02:10:01.818 --> 02:10:02.098]  All right.
[02:10:04.939 --> 02:10:05.919]  Let's talk about Trump.
[02:10:07.419 --> 02:10:09.120]  People ask me, why do I support Trump?
[02:10:10.498 --> 02:10:11.478]  I know the whole backstory.
[02:10:11.498 --> 02:10:12.439]  I know what happened there.
[02:10:12.799 --> 02:10:18.941]  He was like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, bleach, which he didn't say inject.
[02:10:18.981 --> 02:10:27.664]  He said you wash your mouth with the proper type, watered down chemicals, you know, in the nasal passage.
[02:10:27.704 --> 02:10:29.785]  Studies were there that it would knock out COVID.
[02:10:29.805 --> 02:10:31.125]  I mean, he was right about that.
[02:10:32.426 --> 02:10:40.526]   But then It came out that obviously the shot was poisonous and deadly, as we told you it would be.
[02:10:42.708 --> 02:10:54.339]  And Trump's watching the State of the Union and he's on Truth Social and he's posting comments saying, wow, you know, Biden's claiming credit for my shot and the new shot will cure your cancer.
[02:10:55.455 --> 02:11:07.586]  So I just put out a quick X comment that got 2 plus million views on my X account at RealAlexJones and then, I mean, like I said, I saw one with like 24, 25 million views with a screenshot of what I said.
[02:11:07.967 --> 02:11:11.630]  So this thing has like reached 50 million people or more.
[02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:12.451]  Let's be conservative.
[02:11:12.691 --> 02:11:13.252]  It's more than that.
[02:11:14.352 --> 02:11:15.473]  And it's like a big scandal.
[02:11:15.513 --> 02:11:18.675]  The New York Times, Washington Post calling, oh, you're against Trump now.
[02:11:18.935 --> 02:11:21.297]  Oh, we see all this big controversy.
[02:11:21.337 --> 02:11:23.318]  Well, yeah, because people don't listen to you.
[02:11:23.739 --> 02:11:24.599]  They listen to me.
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:27.561]  But the question is, oh, now you're repudiating Trump.
[02:11:27.601 --> 02:11:28.242]  Now you're against Trump.
[02:11:28.302 --> 02:11:29.763]  No, I'm not Nicole.
[02:11:32.076 --> 02:11:37.599]  So I can support Trump on 95% of what he does and want him in because you don't want him.
[02:11:37.859 --> 02:11:39.379]  You're trying to say we can't vote for him.
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:40.820]  You've taken it off the ballot.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:44.342]  You've done all these indictments, but I can also say, I don't like what he's doing.
[02:11:47.443 --> 02:11:50.305]  I can also say, I don't like what Trump's doing.
[02:11:50.585 --> 02:11:54.206]  He could do the biggest thing ever and come out and say, I got lied to by Fauci.
[02:11:54.807 --> 02:11:56.307]  They told me it was a regular vaccine.
[02:11:56.647 --> 02:11:57.468]  It has problems.
[02:11:57.768 --> 02:11:59.669]  There should be a criminal investigation of these guys.
[02:12:00.828 --> 02:12:03.010]  But he took money from Pfizer for his campaign in 2020.
[02:12:05.431 --> 02:12:10.855]  So I can paradoxically still like Trump and support Trump, but also call Trump out.
[02:12:11.476 --> 02:12:12.176]  And that's what I'm doing.
[02:12:14.378 --> 02:12:22.684]  So here's his BS tweet or post that I retweeted on X. I love Trump, but this is BS.
[02:12:23.145 --> 02:12:25.026]  The so-called vaccine is a biological weapon.
[02:12:25.365 --> 02:12:29.204]   Good news is people are awake and not even 45 can sell this poison.
[02:12:29.204 --> 02:12:35.485]  And what did Trump say?
[02:12:35.485 --> 02:12:45.485]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:12:37.866 --> 02:12:40.186]  The pandemic no longer controls our lives.
[02:12:42.827 --> 02:12:44.307]  The vaccines that saved us.
[02:12:44.827 --> 02:12:45.647]  They saved us.
[02:12:46.007 --> 02:12:47.868]  They admit they didn't even work and erase your immune system.
[02:12:48.288 --> 02:12:53.109]  The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer.
[02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:54.749]  Oh, that's their new thing!
[02:12:55.029 --> 02:13:02.151]  Cancer explodes from the shots, which they admit it causes, which the FDA and the CDC predicted in October.
[02:13:02.251 --> 02:13:02.611]  Pull it up.
[02:13:03.579 --> 02:13:07.102]  FDA, October 2000, predicts probable side effects.
[02:13:07.442 --> 02:13:13.267]  Turbo cancer, myocarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, strokes, infertility.
[02:13:13.287 --> 02:13:18.412]  And then they go, don't worry, we have mRNA now that'll fix the cancer.
[02:13:20.133 --> 02:13:21.214]  So what a sick statement.
[02:13:25.384 --> 02:13:30.166]  Let's see, it has power against Trump because I'm not some leftist that just hates him.
[02:13:30.526 --> 02:13:34.047]  I want him to succeed, but I'm legitimately pissed off.
[02:13:34.787 --> 02:13:37.988]  And I'm not on some Trump cult bandwagon.
[02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:43.590]  All I've been is persecuted for supporting Trump because at the end of the day, he's pig-headed.
[02:13:43.610 --> 02:13:51.433]  It's like they say in Full Metal Jacket, private joker is silly and ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:57.887]  Guys, pull up, go to YouTube, type in, full metal jacket, he's got guts, guts is enough.
[02:13:59.448 --> 02:14:02.910]  So even though the drill sergeant disagrees with the statement, he doesn't back down.
[02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:05.951]  So he says, you're now in charge because you didn't back down.
[02:14:06.252 --> 02:14:06.852]  It's the same thing.
[02:14:07.212 --> 02:14:08.293]  Trump, they hate him.
[02:14:08.573 --> 02:14:10.014]  Trump overall is a great guy.
[02:14:10.734 --> 02:14:14.316]  He was like, everything, legalize everything, try everything.
[02:14:14.596 --> 02:14:16.838]  They said, sir, there's a lockdown, it's killing your economy.
[02:14:18.046 --> 02:14:20.507]  A lot of people that were in the room with him, he said, well, we got a shot.
[02:14:20.527 --> 02:14:22.547]  He knows regular vaccines are real and work.
[02:14:22.767 --> 02:14:23.767]  He's like, oh, you got a vaccine?
[02:14:23.807 --> 02:14:24.107]  Do it.
[02:14:24.587 --> 02:14:26.408]  Well, sir, you can't have it for five years.
[02:14:26.808 --> 02:14:27.908]  Bullshit, he said.
[02:14:28.208 --> 02:14:30.028]  They manipulated him to be the savior.
[02:14:30.509 --> 02:14:32.529]  They knew he wanted to bring the fix.
[02:14:33.429 --> 02:14:36.870]  But his strength is his weakness, and he is so pigheaded.
[02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:42.151]  He will never admit he's wrong, which is great when he's fighting the globalists because he doesn't back down.
[02:14:42.811 --> 02:14:46.272]  But then with us, he does the same thing, and it's BS.
[02:14:47.645 --> 02:14:49.825]  People see it as paradoxical, to me it isn't.
[02:14:49.905 --> 02:14:55.146]  It's like, I have family I love, I agree with 95%, but we disagree on some things, we get in fights.
[02:14:55.306 --> 02:15:01.808]  It doesn't mean we hate each other, it doesn't mean Trump's bad, but man, he just, he's so proud of this.
[02:15:02.208 --> 02:15:11.590]  So he puts out this horseshit, the pandemic, the pandemic, hand to a trumpet imitation, the pandemic no longer controls our lives.
[02:15:11.690 --> 02:15:13.430]  You mean the fraud or the fear of it.
[02:15:14.301 --> 02:15:21.925]  The vaccine that saved us from COVID, no it didn't, it doesn't even work, are now being used to help beat cancer.
[02:15:21.945 --> 02:15:22.825]  That's their new rollout.
[02:15:23.686 --> 02:15:25.566]  Turning setbacks into comebacks.
[02:15:25.967 --> 02:15:27.047]  You're welcome, Joe.
[02:15:27.487 --> 02:15:29.748]  Ninth month approval time versus 12 years.
[02:15:30.389 --> 02:15:32.150]  That would have taken you.
[02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:40.173]  So Trump bought that narrative that he was cutting through the red tape and he was getting it done and he was protecting us and he won't admit they set him up.
[02:15:40.253 --> 02:15:41.154]  That's not good.
[02:15:42.978 --> 02:15:44.519]  But it's okay, because they don't want him.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.021]  He'll secure the borders, he'll bring jobs back.
[02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:52.745]  He's already probably gotten enough medicine on this that he won't do it again, but maybe not.
[02:15:53.025 --> 02:15:54.086]  Maybe he'll try it again.
[02:15:54.786 --> 02:15:59.770]  But my issue is, whatever Trump does, I'll be there calling balls and strikes.
[02:16:00.230 --> 02:16:01.971]  When he does the right thing, I'll support him.
[02:16:02.712 --> 02:16:05.274]  When he does the wrong thing, I will come out against him.
[02:16:06.074 --> 02:16:07.055]  That I will do.
[02:16:07.555 --> 02:16:10.798]  But for anybody saying, well you should support Trump, he's not perfect, really.
[02:16:11.098 --> 02:16:12.479]  The whole establishment's against him.
[02:16:13.649 --> 02:16:14.750]  I don't believe unless they're two evils.
[02:16:15.911 --> 02:16:17.692]  But I also believe in not destroying yourself.
[02:16:19.153 --> 02:16:20.334]  So, that's where we are.
[02:16:20.574 --> 02:16:22.356]  They found the full metal jacket clip, here it is.
[02:16:23.717 --> 02:16:26.079]  Today is Sunday, Divine Worship at 0800.
[02:16:26.839 --> 02:16:28.901]  Get your bunks made, get your uniforms on.
[02:16:29.401 --> 02:16:31.503]  Police call will commence in two minutes!
[02:16:32.554 --> 02:16:33.935]  Private Cowboy, Private Joker!
[02:16:34.095 --> 02:16:34.736]  Sir, yes sir!
[02:16:34.956 --> 02:16:35.677]  Sir, yes sir!
[02:16:35.897 --> 02:16:39.340]  As soon as you finish your bumps, I want you two turds to clean the head.
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:40.521]  Sir, yes sir!
[02:16:40.741 --> 02:16:46.867]  I want that head so sanitary and squared away that the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to go in there and take a dump.
[02:16:47.167 --> 02:16:48.068]  Sir, yes sir!
[02:16:48.088 --> 02:16:50.250]  Private Joker, do you believe in the Virgin Mary?
[02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:51.751]  Sir, no sir!
[02:16:56.035 --> 02:16:57.056]  Well, Private Joker...
[02:16:57.623 --> 02:16:59.167]  I don't believe I heard you correctly!
[02:16:59.848 --> 02:17:01.893]  Sir, the private said no, sir, sir!
[02:17:02.033 --> 02:17:03.136]  Why, you little maggot!
[02:17:03.156 --> 02:17:04.358]  You make me want to vomit!
[02:17:05.472 --> 02:17:09.535]  You goddamn communist heathen, you had best sound off that you love the Virgin Mary!
[02:17:09.976 --> 02:17:11.717]  Or I'm gonna stomp your guts out!
[02:17:12.238 --> 02:17:14.579]  Now, you do love the Virgin Mary, don't you?
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:15.961]  Sir, negative, sir!
[02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:18.723]  Private Joker, are you trying to offend me?
[02:17:18.843 --> 02:17:20.004]  Sir, negative, sir!
[02:17:20.404 --> 02:17:23.146]  Sir, the private believes that any answer he gives will be wrong!
[02:17:23.467 --> 02:17:27.350]  And the senior drill instructor will beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir!
[02:17:27.630 --> 02:17:29.251]  Who's your squad leader, scumbag?
[02:17:29.352 --> 02:17:31.954]  Sir, the private's squad leader is Private Snowball, sir!
[02:17:32.414 --> 02:17:33.295]  Private Snowball!
[02:17:34.497 --> 02:17:34.857]  Sir!
[02:17:34.977 --> 02:17:37.117]  Private Snowball reporting as ordered, sir!
[02:17:37.197 --> 02:17:38.718]  Private Snowball, you're fired!
[02:17:38.878 --> 02:17:40.818]  Private Joker is promoted to squad leader!
[02:17:41.078 --> 02:17:42.258]  Sir, aye, aye, sir!
[02:17:42.378 --> 02:17:43.539]  Disappear, scumbag!
[02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:44.639]  Sir, aye, aye, sir!
[02:17:44.839 --> 02:17:45.559]  Private Pyle!
[02:17:46.619 --> 02:17:48.179]  Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir!
[02:17:48.279 --> 02:17:52.760]  Private Pyle, from now on, Private Joker is your new squad leader, and you will bunk with him!
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:54.380]  He'll teach you everything!
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:55.781]  He'll teach you how to pee!
[02:17:56.061 --> 02:17:56.861]  Sir, yes, sir!
[02:17:57.041 --> 02:18:00.801]  Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts, and guts is enough!
[02:18:01.321 --> 02:18:02.622]  Now you ladies, carry on!
[02:18:02.981 --> 02:18:04.981]  Sir, I, I, sir!
[02:18:04.981 --> 02:18:14.981]   Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
[02:18:14.741 --> 02:18:15.761]  That's what I'll say about Trump.
[02:18:17.182 --> 02:18:19.603]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:20.884 --> 02:18:26.246]  And I had grandparents that were tough.
[02:18:28.147 --> 02:18:31.649]  And you'd be having dinner with them two weeks before they died.
[02:18:32.148 --> 02:18:34.689]  They'd be all being nice and sweet to you.
[02:18:34.689 --> 02:18:39.028]  And my dad's uncle, Leonard, Uncle Leonard, he was so cool.
[02:18:39.028 --> 02:18:42.788]   He came over to my house about 10 years ago, 12 years ago right before he died.
[02:18:43.617 --> 02:18:47.278]  We may make it through this and I've not told you yet what's going on.
[02:18:47.117 --> 02:18:50.476]   and talked about old times and said I love you I won't always be here but we
[02:18:50.476 --> 02:18:56.497]   appreciate what you're doing. He was dead two weeks later and I just want all you
[02:18:56.497 --> 02:19:00.476]   to know that's where InfoWars is. We may make it through this and I've not told
[02:19:00.476 --> 02:19:04.717]   you yet what's going on I'll give you some foreshadowing but it's horrible and
[02:19:04.717 --> 02:19:10.397]   it's what we expect and you'll hear a lot of stuff and there'll be a
[02:19:10.397 --> 02:19:13.117]  lot of things going on.
[02:19:11.692 --> 02:19:12.813]  They're trying to put me in prison.
[02:19:14.114 --> 02:19:15.095]  And again, I asked for this.
[02:19:15.355 --> 02:19:15.936]  I'm not a victim.
[02:19:16.897 --> 02:19:19.920]  But I don't want you to feel sorry for me.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.622]  I want you to back me.
[02:19:22.302 --> 02:19:24.404]  And I want you if I'm gone soon.
[02:19:25.305 --> 02:19:26.226]  They kill me next week.
[02:19:26.366 --> 02:19:27.287]  God forbid they don't.
[02:19:27.347 --> 02:19:28.628]  But you know, God forbid they do.
[02:19:29.864 --> 02:19:32.365]  I just want you to know that we're the real deal and we love you.
[02:19:32.565 --> 02:19:33.245]  We appreciate you.
[02:19:34.085 --> 02:19:36.966]  And that we're in very, very critical times right now.
[02:19:36.986 --> 02:19:43.428]  And so what I'm going to be saying tomorrow night with a Sunday show and the next few weeks here, and hopefully we move through this and we survive.
[02:19:43.468 --> 02:19:44.368]  But if we don't, we don't.
[02:19:44.849 --> 02:19:52.511]  I want you to know that this is potentially the last broadcast you'll ever see of these studios and what we're doing here.
[02:19:54.107 --> 02:20:00.530]  Because the Justice Department has come in here and threatened people and intimidated people and turned people against us.
[02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:03.591]  And that's where we are.
[02:20:05.172 --> 02:20:05.652]  And that's okay.
[02:20:05.672 --> 02:20:11.274]  A lot of people are cowards and they, you know, they can't deal with reality.
[02:20:11.294 --> 02:20:13.195]  They think they work with the system, they're going to be okay.
[02:20:13.835 --> 02:20:15.256]  That's treason against humanity.
[02:20:16.636 --> 02:20:19.077]  All right, so I'm going to end this live transmission at 1220 Central.
[02:20:22.836 --> 02:20:30.462]  I'm just going to ask you all to pray for us, and we appreciate you, and just realize that we're in an epic moment in history right now.
[02:20:31.223 --> 02:20:31.463]  All right.
[02:20:31.483 --> 02:20:32.344]  I'm glad I came in.
[02:20:32.364 --> 02:20:39.490]  I appreciate the crew coming in, and I will see all you hopefully soon, and if not on InfoWars, somewhere else.
[02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:40.651]  God bless and good luck.
[02:20:45.435 --> 02:20:46.656]  But it all boils down to this.
[02:20:47.057 --> 02:20:50.160]  We're bringing you hardcore information on the New World Order.
[02:20:50.501 --> 02:20:54.225]  We told you about lockdowns and poison shots that would attack your immune system decades before.
[02:20:54.685 --> 02:20:56.207]  We exposed Bohemian Grove first.
[02:20:56.287 --> 02:20:58.269]  We exposed 9-11 before it happened.
[02:20:58.610 --> 02:21:02.274]  I am in the zeitgeist, but I cannot continue to fight the globals without your support.
