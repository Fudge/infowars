[00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.910]  It's Sunday, October 27th, 2024.
[00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.890]  We're now eight days out for the most important election in world history.
[00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:27.449]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.929]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.689]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.750]  Eight days, nine hours, 59 minutes, 36 seconds.
[00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.450]  The November 5th, 2024 election.
[00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.270]  It will take weeks to decide if the Democrats have their way.
[00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.289]  And from Pennsylvania to Colorado.
[00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:58.310]  From Georgia to Texas, they're catching people illegally voting and giant election fraud.
[00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.049]  Criminal organizations caught with thousands and thousands of fake voter registrations.
[00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.159]  They filled out Trying to have people illegally vote, they've been caught red-handed.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:24.219]  So, as the FBI predicted two months ago, someone's been hacking into the databases in Pennsylvania and other states that have the voter registration and bringing those down so the states can't conduct those investigations.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.659]  They know right where to hit us, don't they?
[00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.879]  And they tell us where they're going to hit us.
[00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.730]  This is an insane time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.409]  I am your host, Alex Jones, very blessed and very honored to be with you this evening.
[00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.170]  Trump is at Madison Square Garden where he's set to speak in a few hours.
[00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.689]  Where there is a capacity crowd.
[00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.950]  There were over 5,000 articles this week.
[00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:03.230]  I have the list here, the data breakdown, saying that he is Hitler by speaking in New York City at Madison Square Garden.
[00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.930]  And it just gets more ridiculous from that point out.
[00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.530]  But really, no one...
[00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.139]  Is buying it.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.000]  Kamala Harris is in absolute, total, and complete freefall right now.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.379]  And that's why you see all these big newspapers, like the Washington Post, the LA Times, and hundreds of others, not endorsing her.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.539]  And you also see a lot of big establishment, Silicon Valley people, that stabbed Trump in the back, openly reaching out to him.
[00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.819]  Now some people are saying that shows that Trump has sold out.
[00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.050]  No.
[00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.650]  When the deep state thinks they're going to lose, they will then try to cozy up to Trump like they did in 2016.
[00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.889]  And Trump says he's wise to that.
[00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.210]  He said it again on Friday on Joe Rogan.
[00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.490]  And he says he's going to get the right people in this time.
[00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.009]  But that still does remain to be seen.
[00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:07.569]  And he could, by mistakes, or if he's a bad guy on purpose, I don't think that's the case, Let the swamp back in.
[00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.370]  He would do that at his own incredible peril.
[00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:16.370]  Even if he tried to sell out to them, they would still want to destroy him to send a message to any other populist president or leader not just here but around the world.
[00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.819]  So that is not in his interest or our interest or anybody else's interest.
[00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.219]  And boy, do the globalists hate his guts.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.860]  But I've told you we're going to reach a moment of tipping point with Team Humanity where it's not just Elon Musk joining us.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.740]  It's going to be so many others because a lot of these people in the globalist system have gone along with it because the globalists were in power.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:42.159]  As they lose power and as we promote an alternative future for humanity, people have to be ready to win.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.469]  But unlike the totalitarians and the globalists who promised some utopia, All you get is tyranny.
[00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.270]  I'm not promising you some utopia.
[00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:51.189]  Neither is Trump.
[00:03:51.409 --> 00:04:00.090]  But certainly having a governmental corporate system that's pro-human and natalist, pro-baby, pro-family would be a very good start.
[00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.949]  Pro-God.
[00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.560]  Pro-national sovereignty.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.319]  And that's really the common sense majority view throughout modern Western culture that became the model of the world.
[00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.180]  And so we're simply trying to go back to the future.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.939]  Tyranny, totalitarianism, centralization is the old model.
[00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.540]  The globalists are pitching it with a great reset like it's the new model.
[00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.600]  We're trying to bring back the Renaissance in 1776 that is the model of the world and the newest model.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.300]  And the most successful, empowering model, Back to the Future.
[00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:39.100]  As even the New York Post, when they endorsed Trump on Friday, had that headline, Back to the Future with Trump.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.360]  All the clips, all the news, so much more straight ahead.
[00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:46.720]  I don't think we're out of the woods yet, but Kamala is just such a revolting character.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.459]  It's hard to believe she has a...
[00:04:49.129 --> 00:05:00.050]  Co-pilot, just as revolting, two of the most revolting, swarmy, fake people the world's ever seen in Tampon Tim and the cackling hyena, Kamala Harris.
[00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.750]  Stay with us, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:08.370]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this October 27th, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:18.529]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next four hours on this Sunday election emergency special.
[00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.529]  All right.
[00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:26.449]  Wow, Trump is set to speak at Madison Square Garden to a capacity crowd.
[00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:44.829]  You have the insane story and 5,000 plus headlines this week in the U.S. alone that Trump is Hitler because the American Nazi Party spoke there in 1939, 84 plus years ago before Trump was born.
[00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:46.990]  So by that logical extension...
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.699]  The Rolling Stones, Metallica, George Strait, Willie Nelson, the Democratic Party, the RNC, they've all had their conventions there.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.279]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:10.439]  But they think that low-information voters will just hear, did you hear Trump went to that Hitler thing in Madison Square Garden?
[00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.180]  So, because...
[00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:15.279]  Basketball teams have played there.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.319]  They're now Nazis too?
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.480]  Or hockey teams?
[00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.180]  I just wanted to start with that today because it just illustrates how completely whacked out these people are.
[00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.439]  And you saw Hillary, you saw Kamala, you saw Tim Walz.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.660]  They've all been running around saying it.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.060]  You probably don't want to hear from them again.
[00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.579]  I mean, it's on record they've been doing it, but I've got the clips right here.
[00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:37.920]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:39.540]  And then you've got...
[00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:50.379]  Big Mike running around chastising black men and men in general for not voting for Kamala that you're against women if you don't vote for Kamala.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.420]  That's all they've got is more cultural division of the people.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.500]  Then we've got all these headlines that questioning any election fraud is a dangerous conspiracy theory.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:20.889]  The problem is in Colorado and Pennsylvania, And all over the country they have caught criminal gangs creating thousands and thousands and thousands in different counties, each county and each town like Lancaster,
[00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:36.810]  Pennsylvania or Denver, Colorado filing fraudulent filings over the last few months for voter registration so that there would be fake names or false names on the voter rolls so those people could go in and then illegally vote under that name.
[00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.290]  So you've got that going on.
[00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:44.949]  I mean, there is so much happening.
[00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:53.029]  But meanwhile, conspiracy theories and threats, the new reality in U.S. elections.
[00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.829]  No, the new reality is suddenly we don't find out for weeks after.
[00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:00.589]  And the more machines we get and the more stuff we have, the longer it takes.
[00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:01.689]  And it's always the battlegrounds.
[00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:05.410]  Voters are deeply skeptical about the health of the American democracy.
[00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:18.079]  Thousands of votes already cast in Mesa County, Colorado to be re-examined for evidence of fraud after they found massive fraud inside of them.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:27.379]  Breaking appeals court rules, all mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day in order to be counted, but the Democrats say they're still going to count them.
[00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:36.889]  Oh, Trump supporters who bought his lies about the last election face reality in court.
[00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.970]  Oh, they sue you in key jurisdictions and find you liable for pointing out what openly happened.
[00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:49.649]  Republican battleground states legal blitz falters ahead of U.S. presidential election.
[00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:53.250]  And they've got stories like this.
[00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:57.470]  Texas man charged for punching election worker after he asked to remove a Trump hat.
[00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.279]  And we don't need stuff like that.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:20.659]  That's why the Democrats are going to try to extend out the election as long as possible, hoping events happen like this or trying to provocateur events like this so that they can try to create as much civil unrest as possible.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.919]  So we're going to be laying all of that out here tonight.
[00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:41.179]  We're also going to be looking at The pre-programming that we've seen, again, that there's going to be civil unrest, that there's going to be Republican violence, that the Democrats aren't going to certify a Trump win,
[00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:47.039]  that there needs to be an armed uprising if Trump does win, that there's going to be civil war conditions.
[00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:53.279]  These are top Democrat strategists like Carville and Raskin and hell, I mean...
[00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:56.590]  Kamala's said it a whole bunch again the last few days.
[00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:57.789]  Walls has said it.
[00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.049]  Biden has said it.
[00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:08.490]  They're all saying Trump is going to use the military on the American people with no evidence of that and that Trump's going to come for the black people.
[00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:27.470]  Well, it's obvious the globalists are trying to stir up or have already wound up or are going to stage themselves some type of major attack on the Minorities to be blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:28.570]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:37.450]  The power structure is in absolute, total, and complete panic mode.
[00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:49.590]  You have, again, all these major newspapers that are refusing to endorse Kamala when normally they endorse Democrats because they don't want egg on their face.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:11:00.039]  We're good to go.
[00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.990]  Not just here, but around the world.
[00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.389]  I mean, look, everywhere.
[00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.850]  Globalists are being thrown out of power.
[00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:19.090]  Ruling parties are being thrown out of power.
[00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.809]  Japan has had the same ruling government for decades.
[00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:28.490]  Japan's ruling coalition to lose majority for first time in decades.
[00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:32.870]  What happens next and what will markets do in reaction?
[00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:34.529]  You're like, who cares about Japan?
[00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:35.049]  No, no.
[00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:47.929]  It doesn't matter if you're in Austria, or whether you're in New Zealand, or whether you are anywhere in the world, people are throwing the establishment out.
[00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:58.570]  In the UK, they put Labour in, who's the worst, but because the mainline Conservatives did not do anything good and were global as controlled.
[00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:10.799]  Then Labor that had less than 18%, 17.5% support, used a parliamentary manipulation to get into power, but they are the most unpopular group.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.860]  But notice with the coalition they formed, they stayed in power.
[00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:17.940]  Just like Trudeau has 18% support.
[00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.759]  Netanyahu has 19% support.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.000]  But because they're parliaments, they're able to stay in power, just like Japan's done, but now even that coalition...
[00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.309]  Has fallen apart.
[00:12:30.929 --> 00:12:33.169]  So they're running out of tricks.
[00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:36.429]  And that's what's exciting here.
[00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.149]  And the most popular parties by a million miles are anti-globalist parties.
[00:12:42.289 --> 00:12:46.429]  So when I tell you, we're winning the war long term for hearts and minds.
[00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:49.789]  And that globalism is incredibly unpopular and falling apart.
[00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.309]  That's not me just saying that.
[00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.690]  Freedom is extremely popular.
[00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:01.409]  There is a very fast awakening curve that is taking place.
[00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:06.149]  Trump rally at Madison Square Garden sells out in three hours.
[00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:12.450]  And of course that was last week.
[00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.330]  Now it's October 27th on this Sunday broadcast.
[00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:17.169]  Eight days.
[00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.750]  Eight days from the election.
[00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:23.309]  Now...
[00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:31.820]  Elon Musk funded these ads, and these are some of the very best, most powerful, truthful ads out there.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.980]  And they just dropped yesterday.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.440]  The first place they dropped was at Real Alex Jones.
[00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.389]  The pack that Musk funded thought, hey, Alex, how would you like to put these out first?
[00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:46.929]  I thought that was a nice thing, though.
[00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.370]  At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter to me.
[00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.769]  They've got more coming out this week.
[00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.970]  Of course, the main message I put out was, don't just retweet these from real Alex Jones.
[00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:58.629]  Download them yourselves and repost them.
[00:13:59.409 --> 00:14:01.350]  And of course, Musk has been doing just that.
[00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:03.029]  It's not like that was my idea.
[00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:05.610]  But in whatever strategy, there you go.
[00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.429]  So they're very, very powerful.
[00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:10.389]  I want to play all four were put out here.
[00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.230]  I'm going to play three of them.
[00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.909]  Bombshell exclusive.
[00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:15.809]  Elon Musk launches his most powerful attack yet.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:23.740]  On the vicious lies of the deep state-controlled media and their war in America, their lies against Trump and their lies against America.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:32.600]  Then we'll play election-exclusive must-backed ad campaign exposes the Kamala Harris plan to draft women to fight in World War III against China, Russia, and North Korea.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.720]  Let's play clip 10 and 11 back-to-back.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.220]  Here they are.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.940]  By now, most Americans are aware that big media is corrupt and dishonest.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:49.940]  Like magicians, they use the art of redirection to lure your attention, then deceive you.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.460]  As a case study, let's replay this infamous clip from 2017.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.279]  But you also had people that were...
[00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.460]  Very fine people on both sides.
[00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:09.720]  To this day, Democrats insist that former President Trump has failed to disavow the racist elements within that crowd.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.179]  And what did the president then at the time say?
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.639]  There were fine people on each side.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.340]  There were very fine people on both sides.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.659]  My God.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.320]  That's what he said.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.559]  Would it shock you to learn that exactly 50 seconds after Mr.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.039]  Trump made that initial comment?
[00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:30.220]  Very fine people on both sides.
[00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.320]  He then said this.
[00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:39.120]  And I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:48.519]  The fact-checking sites finally debunking Democrats' claims that then-President Trump called neo-Nazis and white nationalists, quote, very fine people.
[00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:52.570]  Ask yourself, how did they hide this for seven years?
[00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.169]  Then ask yourself, what else are they hiding?
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.519]  That Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.460]  Described American fallen soldiers as suckers and losers.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.600]  He's determined to convince you there is a crisis at the border.
[00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.600]  Quote, it doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury an effing Mexican.
[00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:14.559]  Warning of a, quote, bloodbath if he loses the election.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.779]  Admitting that he will, in fact, be a dictator.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.820]  Called for the suspension of the Constitution.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.460]  And is a sexist and a sexual harasser.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.600]  They're playing the public.
[00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:23.399]  You.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:32.559]  If we are ever going to heal as a nation, we must demand integrity from those entrusted as the broadcasters of critical information.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.679]  Together, we will pull back the curtain to expose and hold accountable every network of deception.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.740]  Without truth, there is no trust.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.419]  Without trust, there is no unity.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.559]  Without unity, there is no United States.
[00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.970]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.
[00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.130]  If you are a young adult or the parent of one, please listen carefully.
[00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.089]  The United States is closer now to World War III than ever before.
[00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.470]  Russia, China and Iran have announced the three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.
[00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.029]  The alliance that's been formed should chill us all to the bone.
[00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:27.349]  In preparation for war, 100% of Democrats in the House Armed Services Committee support the military drafting of women aged 18 to 25.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.660]  Congress advancing a plan to draft women into the military.
[00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:36.619]  The proposals would automatically register men for the draft on their 18th birthday.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.740]  It would also require women to enter.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.420]  Even so, Republican pushback is holding the bill back.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.259]  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24?
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.119]  They are stupid.
[00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:51.279]  That is why we put them in dormitories.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.220]  They make really bad decisions.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.680]  For the love of our sons and daughters, whatever you do, do not vote blue.
[00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:09.359]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:14.500]  All right, so we're putting up a fight here and that's all true.
[00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:20.599]  How many people know the Democrats have unanimously in the Congress said they're gonna pass a draft for women?
[00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:23.460]  It's a fact, you look it up, it's not hidden.
[00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.170]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:36.950]  Now, the first ad just gets into some of the lies about Trump, and it mentions the Nazi thing.
[00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.609]  That's all been debunked out for two years.
[00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.109]  General Kelly, total globalist.
[00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.190]  They run it again like it's true and also say, I don't want to pay for damn Mexican things.
[00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:46.549]  Well, why did he offer to pay for it in the first place?
[00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:47.130]  It's all made up.
[00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.849]  Family said that.
[00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.630]  Who acts like that?
[00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:50.690]  Trump doesn't do that.
[00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:51.430]  It's horse crap.
[00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:59.329]  And then they say, oh, he's at Madison Square Garden where the Nazis were 84 years ago in 1939.
[00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.250]  He wasn't even born yet.
[00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.670]  He wasn't born for six years.
[00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.710]  So he wasn't a twinkle in his father's eye or his mother's eye for six years.
[00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:17.390]  And now he's a Nazi for an arena that's had tens of thousands of events at it?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.319]  From Elvis Presley to the Beatles?
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.779]  What the hell does that from Kanye to George Strait?
[00:19:27.819 --> 00:19:30.779]  RNC, DNC, just on and on and on?
[00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:33.220]  It's crazy.
[00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:35.680]  But that's all they've got.
[00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:36.740]  Oh, I heard he's Hitler.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.740]  Really?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.119]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:42.519]  What type of leadership is that?
[00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.470]  And Tim Walls, oh, I'm a gun owner.
[00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.930]  He has this well-known shotgun that's super easy to use that you load in the bottom.
[00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:55.950]  And he's trying to put shells in the butt of the gun.
[00:19:57.289 --> 00:20:00.609]  And then saying to the hunters, and you see this pad on the back?
[00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.930]  That's what old men have.
[00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:03.670]  No, that's what's on the shotguns.
[00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:09.609]  There's nothing worse than an idiot who doesn't know how things work trying to pretend like it.
[00:20:09.769 --> 00:20:11.809]  Everything about him is a fraud.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.339]  So here's Walls just yesterday on Madison Square Garden.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.759]  Here he is.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.140]  Donald Trump has descended into madness over the last few weeks.
[00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:24.259]  And I think some of you don't miss on this.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.519]  Go do your Google on this.
[00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:29.119]  Donald Trump's got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden.
[00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:35.079]  There's a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.579]  And don't think that he doesn't know for one second exactly what they're doing there.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.500]  What?
[00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:42.880]  So what he said is technically true.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.740]  The Nazis did have a rally there.
[00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.359]  And so did the DNC this year.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.220]  Like, so it's true.
[00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:54.259]  Like, Hitler breathed air, you breathed air, you're Hitler.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.680]  Hitler drank water, you drink water, you're Hitler.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.240]  Hitler ate food, you eat food, you're Hitler.
[00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:02.900]  Hitler drove a car, you drive a car, you're Hitler.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.019]  Hitler took a dump, you take a dump, you're Hitler.
[00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:09.200]  Hitler brushes teeth, you brush your teeth, you're Hitler.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.220]  Hitler wore sunglasses, you wore sunglasses, you're Hitler.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.440]  Hell, I'm wearing aviator sunglasses right now, I guess that means I'm Joe Biden.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:27.019]  No, it means I woke up a couple days ago, my eye does this every four or five years, bloodshot bloody, and it hurts in the light, so that's why I'm wearing these, not to look cool.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:42.660]  The point is that this, the magnitude of that clip, and I've got literally dozens of them in the last, if I have an article out here, 5,000 plus articles listed by Google, Trump-Hitler rally, Madison Square Garden.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:50.420]  5,000 plus articles And he goes, listen, you just go Google it.
[00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.700]  He's having a Hitler rally.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.119]  And he knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.240]  Okay, sure.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.819]  Obviously, they know that's preposterous.
[00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:05.480]  That is the most preposterous.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.099]  It's not even thin.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.480]  There's nothing there.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.119]  Except that they're liars.
[00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:13.220]  But that's all they got, folks.
[00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:17.460]  And look, I'm going to play this when we come back because we're going to break in like six minutes.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.000]  But I was the first to point this out, and I don't say that to brag.
[00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:25.359]  I don't know why the most obvious crap isn't known.
[00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:38.960]  I remember like four or five months ago when Kamala first was installed in a coup, and Biden was removed, and they put the fake letter out, and he disappeared, medical emergency eight days and all that, and I said, obviously it's a coup, and they now admitted it was a coup.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.180]  It was common sense.
[00:22:48.189 --> 00:22:59.569]  Kamala has been running around going to these big events and I was the one that noticed it because I saw that big Michigan rally where it looked like she had a big crowd.
[00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:00.490]  She had about 20,000.
[00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:02.890]  It was a big crowd at that hangar.
[00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.450]  And I looked at the comments.
[00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:05.390]  They were like, F you.
[00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.150]  And I checked their X accounts.
[00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:14.710]  They were Democrats and liberals and they were fans of three different Popular girl bands, one of them Taylor Swift.
[00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:17.329]  So I kept saying, screw you, where's Taylor Swift?
[00:23:17.509 --> 00:23:20.609]  And I said, looks to me like they said Taylor Swift was there.
[00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:35.069]  And when I researched that, I found out that they had done that with Beyonce and a bunch of other people, and they'd actually had some rallies where they would have one of these famous hip-hop people or pop people play.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.000]  And then as soon as they play, everybody would leave and Kamala would talk to an empty building.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.059]  So I said, hey, look, it looks like they're staging this.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.059]  The media said, you're crazy.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.180]  She's in Europe.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.640]  Well, I know she was in Europe, but that's how dumb they think the constituents are.
[00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:59.640]  Well, Beyonce, Friday, was in Houston, and it does turn out, they told him two weeks before, that she's coming to a rally with Beyonce and Beyonce's going to perform.
[00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:08.960]  And so at the end of it, Beyonce talks for four minutes, it's over, people got pissed, and there's just minutes of booing and people throwing stuff.
[00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:11.980]  So they did it again.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.880]  At least she was there, though.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.420]  So imagine the bait-and-switch.
[00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:18.720]  Well, they're going to bait-and-switch you on everything, she says.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.339]  Oh, you're going to get reparations.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.619]  Oh, we're going to give you free tuition.
[00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:22.759]  Oh, we're going to give you free housing.
[00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:32.029]  Oh, it's her idea to get rid of Tax on tips.
[00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.809]  No, she pioneered the legislation in the Senate.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.420]  And it didn't get passed when she wrote it.
[00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:44.759]  So then when she became the vice president four years ago, she was the tiebreaker over the Senate.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:53.480]  That's what the VP can do when it's divided 50-50 and got 87,000 new IRS agents hired.
[00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:57.819]  Specifically, they said in the law to go after tips.
[00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:05.640]  People that have got Vimeo and things that are masseuses, that are stylists, that are waiters, that are...
[00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:08.619]  Bellmen, valets.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.799]  And then Trump comes out and says, I'm going to get rid of tax on tips, which he'll actually do.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.900]  He does what he says he's going to do.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.960]  And they go, oh no, no, I'm actually going to do it.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.660]  Who believes anything that comes out of this woman's mouth?
[00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:38.750]  So, another one of the great Maha alliances, that's Make America Healthy Again alliances, with the great Dale Bigtree and Mickey Willis and others, who don't even want the credit, but I'm giving it to him, they did a great job.
[00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:44.549]  We've got more of these totally truthful, accurate, powerful ads when we come back.
[00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.109]  And you've seen a lot of video of Kamala being an evil prosecutor.
[00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:50.390]  But you've never seen it like this.
[00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:53.210]  I mean, this lady is so hateful.
[00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:57.670]  And so, I mean, you know, you think the Wicked Witch looks evil in Wizard of Oz?
[00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:58.630]  Great actress.
[00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:01.009]  Really comes off as just pure evil.
[00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.369]  She is more evil than that woman playing a witch.
[00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:12.390]  I mean, the cackling and the snapping of her teeth and the laughing at what she did to innocent people is just insane.
[00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:15.789]  So that is coming up.
[00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:18.980]  Next segment.
[00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:23.940]  And I'm going to get into all of that, and then I'm going to get into all the other campaign news.
[00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:31.380]  And I shot a whole special report on this last night, literally at AJN Live.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:38.559]  That's the new Alex Jones network that's waiting in the wings and just getting on its feet and everything in case they shut down InfoWars.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.420]  How many days is it the 13th?
[00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:42.059]  How many days is the 13th?
[00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:44.279]  16, 17 days until InfoWars can be shut down?
[00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:48.509]  We do the math, 13 days in November, and there's like three days left now.
[00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.289]  So, yeah, 16, 17 days.
[00:26:51.329 --> 00:26:53.390]  So, that's how crazy all of this is.
[00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:57.109]  And their attempt to shut down the mempool orders all over AP, Reuters, Bloomberg.
[00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:01.029]  And, wow, there's a lot of key intel there as well.
[00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:03.589]  We'll be talking about the First Amendment straight ahead.
[00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:05.150]  There is so much more tonight.
[00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:11.650]  On this live October 27th transmission, eight days out from the election.
[00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:12.190]  Stay with us.
[00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:23.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.589]  We don't sit there and...
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.660]  Shoot in the dark.
[00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:37.420]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:39.279]  You got it right here.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.059]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.779]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.259]  It's not just a detox.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.559]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[00:27:47.819 --> 00:27:48.880]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.259]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:56.250]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.470]  And it goes on and on.
[00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.150]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[00:28:00.329 --> 00:28:01.289]  They're concentrated.
[00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.369]  They're incredible.
[00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.829]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30% and 50% off.
[00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.230]  50% off if you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.190]  I want to be 100% totally crystal clear.
[00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.210]  We have forced the globalists out in the open worldwide, not just here in America.
[00:28:19.809 --> 00:28:20.950]  They are in deep trouble.
[00:28:21.089 --> 00:28:22.309]  Their own internal papers have leaked.
[00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.410]  They admit they're totally screwed.
[00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:24.970]  They're publicly admitting they're totally screwed.
[00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.029]  They have the Davos being the sheer shame.
[00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:27.990]  Everybody hates us.
[00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:28.809]  We have no trust.
[00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:32.910]  That was the name of the forum was how to get the public trust back.
[00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.670]  They had like 95% negative rating.
[00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:37.809]  The internal UN documents came out a few months ago.
[00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.930]  James O'Keefe got them.
[00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.369]  They said 95% of people hate us.
[00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.069]  We're going down.
[00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.990]  We're total scum.
[00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:43.529]  We're criminals.
[00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.089]  They know.
[00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.250]  We're criminals.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.829]  They know.
[00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.289]  That's their head of PR globally.
[00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.029]  So that's where we're at.
[00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.849]  And they can crush me or try to crush Trump or try to come after Elon Musk, which new documents have come out.
[00:28:59.549 --> 00:29:03.289]  MI6, working with the Democratic Party, wants to destroy him.
[00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:05.630]  They made him target number two is what he called.
[00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.349]  They want to put him in prison.
[00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:08.950]  He's doubled his security.
[00:29:10.109 --> 00:29:12.049]  Then new documents came out Wednesday.
[00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.690]  Just type in RFK Jr.
[00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.349]  Black Ops into X. You'll get mainstream news.
[00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:18.930]  MI6 with a plan to destroy him.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.579]  Believe me, I've already experienced it.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:29.700]  Came out in court, the FBI and the CIA the last eight years, did all this to me in the media, all the attacks, the lawfare, taking bank accounts away, everything.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.720]  And I didn't go, oh God, I'm under attack.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.519]  I better give up.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.240]  They're scary.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.579]  I'm like, I already know that.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.720]  I stood up to you.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.799]  I'm not going to sit here and take this crap.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.660]  Whatever happens to me, you want to fight?
[00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:42.380]  You got one.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:42.819]  You're the one.
[00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:44.819]  The tyrants, we're the good guys.
[00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:47.059]  So I believe in the people.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.500]  And I believed in the people 30 years ago when 1% of folks knew about this.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.460]  Now about 50% know a lot.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.059]  30% know a ton.
[00:29:55.259 --> 00:29:57.019]  20% know massive amounts.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.259]  10% are totally informed.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.480]  And you get numbers like that, and that's all over the world, it's bye-bye New World Order.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.279]  I mean, you got 10% that know what's going on, that are highly motivated, it's game over.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:15.500]  So, you're going to see a lot of rats leaving the sinking ship, and you can't trust them, and you can't turn your back on them.
[00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:28.200]  But all these billionaires capitulating to Trump, and all these newspapers refusing to endorse Kamala, Nick Foyntes, who is a smart guy, I disagree with a lot of what he has to say, but I think he has the right to his free speech, makes a lot of good points as well.
[00:30:28.779 --> 00:30:29.740]  He's all over the place.
[00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:32.339]  Those clips are coming up next hour saying, oh, Trump just sold out.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.980]  That's why he's the winner.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:45.799]  The bad guys are always going to try, unless they're already been totally exposed like Gates, to run into the administration and then they'll undermine him there.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.480]  That's what they did eight years ago.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.859]  Trump understands that now and talks about every time he gets up in front of a crowd.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.240]  And I know the inside baseball.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.420]  He does have Tulsi Gabbards and RFK Jr.
[00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:59.500]  and a bunch of other super patriots advising him.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.599]  And he is intending to go after the whole thing.
[00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.049]  And this time, not let the bad guys into the administration.
[00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:14.069]  And I will be here watching very closely when he wins the election, who they start bringing in.
[00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.849]  But so far, he's done nothing but bring good people in, and they're greenlit and being pushed by him everywhere.
[00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:24.809]  He wouldn't be greenlighting and promoting them everywhere if he wasn't going to continue to bring them in.
[00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.670]  So I see nothing but good signs.
[00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:28.329]  And they still may try to kill Trump.
[00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.369]  But on the surface...
[00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:37.740]  I saw a month ago signs of capitulation, and I was optimistic, but not hopeful.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.299]  Then I saw more signs they're going to go into martial law and total tyranny, and he's Hitler.
[00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:48.579]  And that's two different competing camps in the establishment.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.619]  Some that go, look, killing him or doing this isn't going to work.
[00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:54.119]  It's everything we do only pisses people off more.
[00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:58.819]  Trying to intimidate these populists isn't working.
[00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:05.619]  We better back off and then just try to cut our losses because we're not going to beat the populist uprising.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.759]  We can just try to co-opt it.
[00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.119]  And yeah, they're going to try that.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.200]  I mean, Nick is right that the attempt to co-opt is going on.
[00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:14.740]  He's right about the attempt to do it 100%.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.359]  But it's not happening.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.880]  That remains to be seen.
[00:32:20.599 --> 00:32:28.140]  And I don't expect Trump to do a perfect job because he's got tens of thousands of major positions to fill and millions in the executive branch.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:30.820]  Okay?
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.039]  Millions that one way or another, the military's alone.
[00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:38.400]  So it's going to be a process, but Trump has said he didn't understand it before.
[00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:39.680]  Now he does.
[00:32:40.319 --> 00:32:43.200]  And when Trump does things I don't agree with, I will be on him.
[00:32:43.579 --> 00:32:45.000]  You can better believe it.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:33:01.549]  But I'm only covering that now, and I'll cover it more next hour, to understand All the real scientific polls, the betting markets, the real numbers, the internal numbers the Democrats are getting, and that's come out in the news today, and the internal numbers the Republicans are getting, that aren't the classic polling agency,
[00:33:01.589 --> 00:33:09.869]  but are AI data scoops, show a ultra-massive swing to Trump.
[00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.809]  A landslide bigger than Reagan in 1984.
[00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:17.210]  Bigger than Nixon in 1974.
[00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.849]  So...
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.740]  It's on.
[00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:27.180]  And they're going to come after him like they did with Nixon, with moles and internal groups and internal groups committing crimes and blaming it on Trump.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.859]  And they're going to come after him with scandals and more stuff.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.420]  And they're going to come after him with crises.
[00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:35.539]  And so if you think we're out of the woods when we get Trump in there, think again.
[00:33:35.619 --> 00:33:36.839]  And I'm not saying we got him in yet.
[00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:41.940]  Because I saw a lot of signs a month ago of capitulation.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.940]  I'm seeing 10 times the signs of capitulation now the last three days.
[00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:54.160]  But there's a whole other track that we're going to have armed uprisings and we're not going to certify the election and we're going to have civil war conditions.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.619]  And so people ask me on X to see the comments, well, which is it?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.900]  Is he winning in a landslide or is there going to be a civil war?
[00:34:02.299 --> 00:34:04.339]  There's different factions happening.
[00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.070]  And so it's like a hurricane coming in.
[00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.190]  It's a Cat 5.
[00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:10.150]  It's going to cause destruction.
[00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.130]  We're not sure how bad.
[00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.550]  I mean, I don't know, and the globalists don't know, because they're not all powerful.
[00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.889]  They want a cashless society.
[00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:22.789]  They want an AI-controlled system that tracks everything we do and everywhere we go to try to bring in that level of control.
[00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:23.809]  They don't have that yet.
[00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:30.949]  They are the most powerful group in the world, and they're trying to influence everybody and trying to act like they're in control, but they're not.
[00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:35.389]  And as that illusion of control fades...
[00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:51.949]  It's going to create a power vacuum in government, in corporations, in churches, in families, as people get shook up, as an old order goes down, and new systems vie for control of the system.
[00:34:53.349 --> 00:35:00.269]  And that's why you want a small government and diversity in corporations and businesses and competition so you don't get centralization.
[00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:02.110]  Centralization is always the plague.
[00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.570]  It's always the curse.
[00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.909]  It's where the tyranny comes from.
[00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:11.469]  It's why our government has separation of powers and the federalist system to tie down the different branches of power.
[00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:22.750]  Yes, we need some system because anarchy only lasts a few days and then gives way to warlords and then tyranny.
[00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:27.170]  So you want a limited government to tie down the tyrant.
[00:35:29.469 --> 00:35:35.309]  And that's basically the American philosophy of our republic that's been the model of the world.
[00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:45.619]  So, I'm seeing very concerning signs Of the globalist staging false flags to make it make sense that Trump's Hitler, because right now it's a big joke.
[00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:54.139]  Well, yeah, until they do the attack on a black college or church or Hispanic center or something like that and blame it on Trump supporters.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.960]  Then it'll make a lot of sense, and that's why I'm saying look for that.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.599]  But if we're watching for it, it really makes it hard for them to be able to pull it off.
[00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:06.599]  I mean, it's been leaks inside the FBI that destroyed their whole Governor Whitmer fraud.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.780]  Where she was supposedly going to be kidnapped.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.219]  That was all synthetic and made up.
[00:36:11.179 --> 00:36:18.079]  And January 6th has been, you know, exposed and turned out that was a federal operation, like I said that day there on the ground, trying to stop folks from going in.
[00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:18.880]  So they're going to kill people.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.099]  It's going to be Kent State 2.0.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.380]  And so the bottom line is we're in a battle for control of the republic.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.519]  The democrats have hijacked the nation.
[00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:31.519]  They've been holding us hostage for a long time with the neocons of the republican party.
[00:36:32.769 --> 00:36:48.429]  We have a populist revolution through Trump, and you see total political realignments with all these former Democrats that have souls joining him, and all of these blacks and Hispanic voters that can see the destruction and the danger of the Democratic Party out of just common sense and self-preservation joining Trump.
[00:36:50.889 --> 00:37:04.929]  And you've got the policies of the globalists driving all these countries away from the dollar into the BRICS, and so then NATO in the West starts threatening nuclear war, And then China, North Korea, and Russia respond by, okay, let's go down.
[00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.630]  Let's have a fight.
[00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.630]  I mean, the North Koreans and the Chinese and the Russians aren't exactly the wimps on the block.
[00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:15.409]  They're not exactly people that won't go to war with you.
[00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:18.710]  So it's completely cuckoo.
[00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:42.769]  And if the neocons and the liberals think starting a fight with the Russians and the Chinese and North Koreans is going to be like going and killing a bunch of Arabs, which is not a complete cakewalk, but it's a bed of roses compared to war with Russia and China and then Iran and North Korea sprinkled in for good measure.
[00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:45.659]  And I'll hit that next hour, too.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:54.860]  You know, Israel's been blowing up the air bases, the missile defense, and the aircraft, and the missile bases, as I just said, of the Iranians ahead of blowing up their nuclear facilities.
[00:37:55.139 --> 00:38:00.260]  And then they're going to target the Iranian leaders, the Ayatollah of rock and rolla.
[00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:04.820]  And so that's going to happen in days.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:12.820]  And I told you weeks ago, look for Israel to hit right before the election, and then the documents came out, and sure as hell they did it, and people are all next going, oh, Jones is fear-mongering.
[00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:15.000]  Yeah, I'm fear-mongering.
[00:38:15.619 --> 00:38:18.760]  Meanwhile, Russia just took a bunch more towns and cities in Ukraine.
[00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:25.519]  Undoubtedly, I believe the Ukrainians when they say it, the North Koreans are inside now fighting.
[00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:30.900]  We've always been at war since 1950 with North Korea.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.719]  That war never ended.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.539]  There was a ceasefire on July 27th, 1953.
[00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:36.800]  That ceasefire is basically over.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.239]  You haven't heard that in the news, but that's what that is.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.780]  Because believe me, the U.S. is running NATO and running the attack in Ukraine.
[00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:54.320]  So that's how fast all of this is escalating very, very, very, very fast.
[00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:00.059]  Alright, so let me get back into what I was just mentioning with Kamala.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:10.420]  Here's one of the Maha, make America healthy again, with MAGA Alliance ads that the great, game-changing, maverick Elon Musk did.
[00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:16.280]  And I saw a commenter on one of my videos, he goes, Jones has got to have a secret contract with Musk.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.739]  He's got to be getting paid to say this.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.360]  Uh, no.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.400]  You don't think I don't like Musk running all these pro-Trump ads?
[00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:37.579]  You don't think I don't like Musk exposing the whole New World Order replacement migration agenda and the gun control agenda and the pedophile agenda and the trans agenda and World War III and just devastating the enemy with billions of views a day of the videos and articles he puts out?
[00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:40.539]  You don't think I don't like in this fight down here?
[00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:46.650]  Which I was leading with you, the listeners, by ourselves in any prominent way.
[00:39:46.889 --> 00:39:48.349]  A lot of the great people, they were small.
[00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:57.250]  We tried to boost for decades and then to have Tucker wake up and Rogan wake up and now Musk come in and Trump educated now.
[00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.250]  I mean, yeah, I totally back Trump.
[00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.730]  I totally back Musk.
[00:40:00.969 --> 00:40:03.170]  This is absolutely a godsend.
[00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:08.409]  You pray to God for awakening and a resistance and then people get it in spades.
[00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:20.460]  Royal flush, grand slam, Triple crown, just absolutely beautiful, and then, oh, it's impossible for good guys to start winning.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.480]  This must be bad.
[00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.639]  And it's not perfect.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.440]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:26.739]  We're all sinners, but this is a real anti-globalist resistance.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:35.119]  I mean, Elon Musk is, there's a world government that wants to kill you and depopulate you that hates babies, and we need to stop the world government.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.539]  I mean, these are quotes to their face at the World Government Summit last year.
[00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:46.110]  I mean, you're just literally getting absolute devastation of the New World Order agenda.
[00:40:46.389 --> 00:40:47.869]  The New World Order's running for the hills.
[00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:54.349]  All of these billionaires are turning and flipping support to Trump, at least tacitly, out of fear.
[00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:58.590]  Not of Trump persecuting them, but they got left behind.
[00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.769]  They bet on the wrong horse.
[00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:04.710]  Everybody just expected this New World Order to win, and a thousand years of globalism were all eating bugs.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.960]  And it's not that easy to totally enslave everybody if people are informed and don't roll over.
[00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:16.420]  And then as we start to win, more people are going to join us.
[00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:17.980]  How many decades have I told you?
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.000]  You have to prepare to turn the tide of the globalist assault.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.900]  I've studied history.
[00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:26.260]  Satan operates the same.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.360]  He has many antichrists.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.139]  One final one.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.579]  He tries to bring forward the same system over and over again.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.139]  I believe humanity.
[00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:32.800]  I feel it.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.320]  I see it.
[00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:35.139]  Repulses this attack.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.960]  But God leaves it up to us.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.199]  God made us with free will and knows the outcome, but gives us free will.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.619]  We will repulse this attack.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.639]  There'll be a big awakening.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.840]  And then the AI and the globalism and the decadence will be so powerful that within decades...
[00:41:53.889 --> 00:42:02.090]  This renaissance gets defeated, and then the big one comes in, and then that's a very short time the Antichrist is in control.
[00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:05.210]  That's how I see it, how I feel it, what my spirit tells me.
[00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:06.989]  But God's given us free will.
[00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:13.269]  We can repulse that next attack and push it off.
[00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:18.550]  See, it's all a game, isn't it?
[00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.190]  But for your soul.
[00:42:21.659 --> 00:42:25.019]  It's a third-dimensional molecular simulation.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.079]  Not a false simulation, not a digital thing in a computer.
[00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:35.059]  It's a total universe, planet, real people, whole nine yards, your ancestors, all of it, in a real war game.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.780]  So it's a real war, but at this level, to God, it's a war game.
[00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:44.019]  You're not going to get the big stuff to you, you know, at least past this level.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.539]  By the way, I've...
[00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:48.800]  Been shown a little thing or two.
[00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:53.039]  And if you think we're going to be up in heaven floating around on clouds...
[00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:58.769]  You can see that, and if you want to punch out, you can always go to that.
[00:42:58.949 --> 00:43:00.570]  You make it past level one.
[00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.670]  This is level one.
[00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:05.949]  But nobody, almost nobody wants to punch out once you get past level one.
[00:43:06.389 --> 00:43:10.849]  Then it gets even more intense what you face and the systems you're going to be dealing with.
[00:43:11.389 --> 00:43:14.449]  So it just gets cooler and more wild, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.530]  And so it's really cool.
[00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:20.070]  God made it.
[00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:20.889]  It's beyond cool.
[00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.469]  All right, let me go ahead and shift gears back into what I was talking about here.
[00:43:24.929 --> 00:43:27.889]  Let's go ahead and play this Kamala is Cruel ad.
[00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:29.250]  Totally truthful.
[00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:31.090]  And just look at the look on her face.
[00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.590]  If you're a radio listener, it's powerful.
[00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.769]  But you've got to go to Real Alex Jones.
[00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.369]  I posted it yesterday.
[00:43:36.449 --> 00:43:37.070]  She's got to scroll down.
[00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:38.309]  They're like 30, 40 posts.
[00:43:38.409 --> 00:43:38.869]  You'll find it.
[00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.170]  You've got to share this.
[00:43:40.289 --> 00:43:43.989]  Elon Musk has also reposted it, so you can find it at Elon Musk.
[00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:44.409]  Here it is.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.460]  Dear Kamala Harris, let's get one thing crystal clear.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:56.159]  The vast majority of American men have no issue with electing a female president.
[00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.010]  Our issue lies solely with you.
[00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.389]  You were second in charge of California for 13 years.
[00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:13.030]  As California's Attorney General, Harris promoted enforcement of a law that allowed prosecutors to seek jail time for parents of truant kids.
[00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.530]  As a prosecutor and law enforcement, I have a huge stick.
[00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:21.289]  So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.
[00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:22.940]  I thought that was crazy.
[00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:27.440]  I was like, how can you lock parents up?
[00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:31.420]  If you don't go to school, Kamala's gonna put you and me in jail.
[00:44:33.539 --> 00:44:35.820]  Yes, we achieved an intended effect.
[00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:42.199]  I opened the door and I see at least seven or eight cops that wanted to arrest me.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.059]  As a matter of fact, they did.
[00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:46.739]  And frankly, you know the prosecutors in my office who volunteered to do this?
[00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.179]  My homicide prosecutors.
[00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:51.480]  My gang prosecutors.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.320]  And they went over there and I said, when you go over there, look really mean.
[00:44:55.739 --> 00:45:04.300]  She had me arrested and prosecuted because my handicapped daughter was sick in the hospital and had missed some days of school.
[00:45:04.519 --> 00:45:12.030]  I learned That with the swipe of my pen, I could charge someone with the lowest level offense.
[00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:13.929]  That person could be arrested.
[00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.909]  They could lose time from work and their family maybe lose their job.
[00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.429]  They'd have to come out of their own pocket to help hire a lawyer.
[00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.590]  They'd lose standing in their community.
[00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:28.610]  I lost my job and couldn't pay rent and we got evicted.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.219]  Weeks later, I could dismiss the charges, but their life would forever be changed.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.559]  I became homeless.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.599]  We had to move into a motel.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.539]  All because of the swipe of my pen.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:47.179]  I don't agree what Kamala Harris did to my mom, and I don't agree with what she's done to other parents as well.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.760]  You were second in charge of the United States for four years.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.480]  If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
[00:45:57.639 --> 00:46:05.340]  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.599]  Inflation is hitting the highest level in 39 years.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.699]  A record high number of illegal crossings.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.760]  Crime's been surging across the nation.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.300]  Huge spikes in homicide.
[00:46:14.579 --> 00:46:22.820]  Could we be heading toward World War III? After 17 years of failed leadership, you are now asking us to trust you as first in charge of our country.
[00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:25.750]  I am concerned and focused on big issues.
[00:46:25.989 --> 00:46:31.349]  Elementary and middle school truancy is actually a big issue if we're trying to save the state money.
[00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:37.849]  Because of truancy, California public schools lose $1.4 billion a year in funding.
[00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.230]  I want money.
[00:46:41.469 --> 00:46:47.690]  My message to all Americans, do not trust Kamala Harris.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:55.340]  As men and protectors of women and children, you are simply a risk we are not willing to take.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.199]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[00:47:04.039 --> 00:47:08.500]  All right, we're going to start the next hour in about eight minutes, and I'm going to get into all the other clips.
[00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:09.980]  The news I haven't hit, there's so much.
[00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.059]  Please stay with us for that.
[00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:17.599]  I'm going to get into, if the globalists go down the civil war path, what it's going to probably unfold like, how we stop it, how we mitigate it.
[00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:29.380]  But before we go any further, as I mentioned earlier, and I covered it on last night's Saturday show from the Alex Jones Network on X at AJN Live.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.400]  Be sure and follow us there at AJN Live.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.559]  That it came out this week.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.039]  Documents leaked out of the EU because of Patriots.
[00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:37.739]  They confirmed they were real.
[00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:43.940]  And out of MI6, British intelligence, a plan to take over, shut down X, and put Elon Musk in prison.
[00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:46.519]  Other documents leaked, and they confirmed they were real.
[00:47:48.039 --> 00:47:51.139]  That MI6 is going after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.380]  with, quote, black ops.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.139]  And that can include murder.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.920]  Of course, they killed his dad and his uncle, so he knows all about that.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.300]  They refused him Secret Service protection.
[00:47:58.599 --> 00:48:01.800]  One reason he joined Trump is to show everybody what's really going down.
[00:48:03.039 --> 00:48:05.860]  So, the very same groups have done all this to InfoWars.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.500]  Here's headlines.
[00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:09.659]  AP, Reuters, NBC News, Bloomberg, overhead shot.
[00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:14.719]  Alex Jones fighting attempt to sell his social media accounts, rights, and InfoWars at auction.
[00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:21.519]  Alex Jones trustee bid, that's the federal Justice Department, to sell his social media paused by a judge.
[00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:22.579]  That was Friday.
[00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:34.900]  Now, they say in the filing, they own the name Alex Jones, and I won't be able to use that, which under federal law you can't do, violates the 13th Amendment against slavery.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:41.500]  And they say real Alex Jones on X is theirs, and anything else I ever try to set up, that I have no identity.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.059]  Now, I told people this months ago and showed you documents, and it was just like, that's too unbelievable.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.360]  Well, now it's all admitted.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.699]  Now, they tried to ram this through Friday.
[00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:53.719]  The judge said, I want an emergency hearing next Friday.
[00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:57.920]  The other side said, oh, we need more time, so that could mess up the auction on the 13th.
[00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.590]  You can get Infowars.com.
[00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.289]  You can get Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:03.110]  I've looked at the law.
[00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:10.050]  I'm not really debating that, even though there's some NAACP cases where folks try to just do that just to shut them down, and the Fifth Circuit overruled that.
[00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.590]  So that'll probably have some big issues, too.
[00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.070]  But I capitulated to that because that's not that important.
[00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:20.329]  My name is, and if they're able to get my name, they'll be able to get your name.
[00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:22.630]  That's the next level of the social credit score.
[00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.050]  If you're not a good globalist, they don't just take your bank account and get you fired.
[00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.670]  They take your name.
[00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:29.079]  So it's very serious.
[00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:32.460]  So we need funds to fight these legal cases.
[00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:38.280]  And our sponsors, not just another studio, not just Hire the Crew, they shut us down on the 13th.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.300]  I need money to fight a whole bunch of these cases, and we're winning them now.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:47.480]  We're not in the rigged cases where they pick judges in Austin that's communist and Connecticut that's communist.
[00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:55.210]  They're running into big problems, and I've got real high-powered, well-known lawyers that are just licking their lips right now.
[00:49:55.369 --> 00:49:57.429]  But it takes money to do this.
[00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.690]  So now is action time.
[00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.829]  I need you to go to the AlexJonesStore.com and get incredible products.
[00:50:03.329 --> 00:50:05.590]  Sign up for VIP $30 a month.
[00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.070]  Cancel any time.
[00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.030]  You get $40 free each month.
[00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.230]  That's $10 extra to buy product at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.820]  And there's not just the ultimate CMOS that is the superfoods for your whole body, full of the key iodine, everything else.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.780]  Take an hour to describe it.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.559]  You don't just have that.
[00:50:21.659 --> 00:50:27.679]  You have HydroForce that's not just an electrolyte drink, all-natural fruit crunch that tastes great.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.860]  The name's wrong.
[00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.280]  It's a private label of a top-selling brand.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.920]  It has all these vitamins, all these minerals, and other stuff in it.
[00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:36.039]  It is a pre-workout, a post-workout.
[00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:37.679]  It's so good for your whole body.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:43.019]  You want HydroForce up to 50% 5% off when you get three canisters.
[00:50:43.219 --> 00:50:44.099]  50% when you get two.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.920]  40% off when you get one.
[00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:48.699]  And then they get a lost leader that's only running a few days.
[00:50:49.139 --> 00:50:51.599]  20% off at checkout on top of that.
[00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:55.000]  That means when you get three canisters, it's a lost leader.
[00:50:55.159 --> 00:50:55.940]  They're losing money.
[00:50:56.099 --> 00:50:56.860]  That is a deal.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.860]  But they think it's so great, and it is, they want you to try it.
[00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:10.610]  Ultimate CMOS. The Parasite Detox, the Great Probiotic 60 Billion, all the highest quality probiotics integrated into one.
[00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.289]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:14.489 --> 00:51:18.409]  And when you're there, t-shirts, hoodies, and just look at some of these hats.
[00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:19.010]  Overhead shot.
[00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.190]  Got a nice classic black with white MAGA on it.
[00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:24.409]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:51:24.929 --> 00:51:26.150]  High quality hat.
[00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.829]  You got what I like.
[00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:30.389]  It says MAGA murdered out.
[00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.530]  Got another one that says Make America Free Again, Murdered Out.
[00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:38.329]  Got a bunch of Alex Jones, Gadsden Flag Hats.
[00:51:38.449 --> 00:51:39.329]  It's just amazing.
[00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.250]  Check them all out at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.769]  And then another great sponsor that's separate from InfoWars, because they shut that down.
[00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:48.429]  Okay, we got sponsors that are going to back us.
[00:51:48.679 --> 00:52:04.059]  My dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com, incredible, game-changing, five-star products, like, finally back in stock, super blue, no fluoride in it, fortified with iodine, tea tree, nano, silver, essential oils, peppermint, you name it, concentrated,
[00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:07.920]  only takes a little bit on your brush, toothbrush, it's there.
[00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:11.460]  It's right there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:12.519]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:13.159]  Limited supplies.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:13.699]  Selling out.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.659]  Is it a stimulant?
[00:52:14.679 --> 00:52:15.820]  Feels like a one-no letdown.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.880]  Cleans out your cells.
[00:52:17.139 --> 00:52:18.360]  Cleans out your mitochondria.
[00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:20.900]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:52:22.019 --> 00:52:22.920]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:23.019 --> 00:52:25.780]  Great products, and it funds the second American Revolution.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.639]  I'll never give up, never back down, never sell out, but I can give out if you don't back me.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.519]  So back me.
[00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:31.300]  I'm backing you.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.300]  I'm betting on you.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.960]  You see it everywhere.
[00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:35.239]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.500]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:45.360]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:53.980]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games, and I've been accurate about 98% of the time, and I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[00:52:54.019 --> 00:52:55.139]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[00:52:55.139 --> 00:52:55.840]  I've made mistakes.
[00:52:56.679 --> 00:53:03.920]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[00:53:04.119 --> 00:53:08.159]  And we're reaching tens of millions of new people every day.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.840]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.699]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.159]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:17.940]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:26.159]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.829]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:38.570]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed, there's been backup systems set up and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:42.989]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:47.170]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[00:53:47.469 --> 00:53:49.730]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[00:53:49.909 --> 00:53:51.550]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[00:53:52.369 --> 00:53:58.030]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:09.590]  And it's got a lot of the classic supplements I've promoted for years, but also a lot of new proprietary ones and other top products, private labeled by my dad, who will always back me as long as he gets the support.
[00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:23.340]  So please visit drjonesnaturals.com, the best toothpaste out there, fluoride-free, fortified with nano-silver, iodine, does incredible things in the mouth, tea tree, peppermint, organic, concentrated.
[00:54:23.679 --> 00:54:24.820]  It's amazing.
[00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:29.639]  Super blue toothpaste, now back in stock, limited supply, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:54:30.509 --> 00:54:35.590]  Then, there's a product you absolutely must get that's been sold out for a while, limited supply back in stock.
[00:54:35.909 --> 00:54:37.849]  Next level, foundational energy.
[00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.349]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:43.510]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:54.070]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like organic B-complex.
[00:54:57.469 --> 00:55:01.489]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:02.630]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:07.789]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:09.469]  But everybody feels it.
[00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:14.829]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want, a lot of people do.
[00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:19.090]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[00:55:19.929 --> 00:55:23.730]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.730]  You want to experience next level foundational energy.
[00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:30.710]  Just like our information, it's absolutely amazing and I know you're going to want to order it again.
[00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:35.570]  We have something like an 85% reorder rate, my dad does, on this product.
[00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:36.849]  People love it.
[00:55:37.469 --> 00:55:38.869]  So a limited supply came back in.
[00:55:38.989 --> 00:55:42.989]  Get your next level of financial energy now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:46.909]  There's also the natural sleep aid that works really good, even if you don't have trouble sleeping.
[00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.570]  It makes it deeper, more restful, so good for your immune system.
[00:55:49.989 --> 00:55:51.010]  Try Rocket Rest.
[00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:55.250]  If you want a stimulant that's all natural and really works well, well, that's top 10.
[00:55:58.269 --> 00:55:58.809]  We're good to go.
[00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:12.530]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:13.809]  Foundation for everything you're doing.
[00:56:13.929 --> 00:56:14.710]  That's a good staple.
[00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:19.849]  If you're looking for high-quality multivitamin, it's a private label of a very top, high-rated one that's got five stars.
[00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:26.789]  And so many other great products, like the concentrated seed sprouts that are so good for your gut, so good for your body.
[00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:31.070]  Just some of the sprouts, your gut uses them.
[00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.690]  It's a long story.
[00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:34.010]  To create a special type of...
[00:56:34.449 --> 00:56:39.750]  Amino acids that only your intestines can create that helps regrow, you know, tendons, muscle.
[00:56:39.909 --> 00:56:41.769]  I mean, it's gut wall health.
[00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:44.190]  You want to get fiber green concentrates.
[00:56:44.429 --> 00:56:48.230]  All of these products and more are at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:55.969]  So if you want to back what we're doing, you want to keep us on the air, and your great products at the same time, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.590]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, we can't do this without you.
[00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:04.110]  If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:04.909]  But that's not happening.
[00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:10.130]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[00:57:10.409 --> 00:57:12.869]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.030]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.
[00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.090]  I want you to see how great these products are.
[00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.869]  My dad does.
[00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.630]  I need this sponsor into the future.
[00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:22.909]  So I want you to get high-quality products that really work so you come back.
[00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:27.260]  Again and again, like a restaurant that serves really good, healthy, high-quality, delicious food.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.559]  I want the line around the block.
[00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:29.719]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:32.150]  My dad wants to line around the block.
[00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:36.230]  So you've got to try it to see how great it is, DRJonesNaturals.com.
[00:57:36.329 --> 00:57:39.750]  And separately, our other big sponsor is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:45.329]  They will continue to make sure we stay on the air with T-shirts, with other high-quality supplements, with ball caps, with hoodies.
[00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:46.769]  There's some amazing designs.
[00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.329]  Some of the shirts are $20, $25, $30.
[00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:53.269]  But there are two shirts, the classic InfoWars red on navy blue.
[00:57:54.670 --> 00:58:05.250]  And a rebellion to tyrants shirt that are both $50 that have extra markup in them if you really want to support us being sure we have the funds we need to go in the future.
[00:58:05.469 --> 00:58:08.190]  And on my children, we are behind on funds.
[00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:13.889]  I haven't been defeated yet because you've been backing me, but we are so close right now.
[00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:23.409]  And so I'm here asking for your support and asking you humbly to take action now and get great products at thealexjonesstore.com as well as drjonesdadryls.com.

[00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:16.630]  And I see you doing it.
[00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:17.849]  You understand the urgency.
[00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:18.989]  So I salute you.
[00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:22.190]  So for myself and the whole crew, thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[00:59:22.469 --> 00:59:23.309]  Thanks for coming through.

[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.159]  And I humbly and respectfully thank you.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.019]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.880]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.

[00:59:37.619 --> 00:59:42.619]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.639]  Because I hadn't really...
[00:59:44.639 --> 00:59:45.960]  There's other folks on this.
[00:59:46.059 --> 00:59:47.179]  Other folks that are great run this.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:47.880]  The folks at Bigly.

[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.019]  Total Patriots.
[00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:50.539]  J-Sexers.
[00:59:50.619 --> 00:59:51.019]  You name it.
[00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:54.280]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.219]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:09.019]  So, if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at AliceJonesStore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.840]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:16.269]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[01:00:16.409 --> 01:00:19.489]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:21.110]  Monthly member credits.
[01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:26.730]  Every month as a VIP member you get $40 of free store credit.
[01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:28.170]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.630]  That's right.
[01:00:28.809 --> 01:00:32.289]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[01:00:32.659 --> 01:00:36.619]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:37.699]  That's $10 you make.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:48.579]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:52.500]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[01:00:53.019 --> 01:01:01.280]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.630]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced the 30th this month.
[01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:05.650]  You want to win?
[01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:06.789]  I know you do.
[01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.550]  The VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:12.190]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.409]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:16.329]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[01:01:16.449 --> 01:01:19.949]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.670]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[01:01:21.889 --> 01:01:24.469]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:29.750]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:30.989]  You're in the know.
[01:01:31.389 --> 01:01:33.210]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:34.449]  Pre-shipping.
[01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:37.590]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:01:37.769 --> 01:01:39.010]  It just goes on from there.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:46.110]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:48.440]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:01:48.619 --> 01:01:50.340]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.019]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:56.460]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:01:57.219 --> 01:01:58.199]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:01.519]  It's up to you whether you want to back.
[01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.489]  The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:13.809]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:02:13.989 --> 01:02:21.070]  And I just don't know why I'm this lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.210]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.170]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.230]  We've already...
[01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.349]  Just devastated them.
[01:02:29.489 --> 01:02:32.510]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.070]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:38.389]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:49.030]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.829]  So, again, I don't give up.
[01:02:50.969 --> 01:02:53.710]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:02:53.889 --> 01:02:57.349]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.809]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:02:59.929 --> 01:03:01.289]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:03:01.469 --> 01:03:06.889]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score.
[01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:10.010]  And that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:14.989]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:18.349]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.940]  I mean, it's just what?
[01:03:21.179 --> 01:03:22.199]  This is a joke.
[01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:23.679]  This is ridiculous.
[01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:25.239]  We're changing the world.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.239]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.579]  Our number two is now live.
[01:03:33.019 --> 01:03:40.920]  When the US federal government failed the people of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, Americans were not upset enough.
[01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:43.440]  And now it seems we've become accustomed to it.
[01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:48.400]  The suspicious fires in California and Hawaii continue to go ignored.
[01:03:49.539 --> 01:03:54.780]  Thanks to the help of their neighbors, the victims of Hurricane Helene are being looked after.
[01:03:55.019 --> 01:03:57.500]  And they can still use our help.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:02.659]  According to independent reports, FEMA hasn't been seen helping anyone.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.820]  And we now know that this is because they have been busy building camps in the area.
[01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:11.099]  Camps big enough to house 700 FEMA employees.
[01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:18.829]  But we were just wondering what it is y'all are doing because FEMA's had, you know, they said they were pulling out because of militia and stuff, which that was debunked.
[01:04:18.869 --> 01:04:22.369]  So we just want to get the truth out because people are kind of like all over the place.
[01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:23.190]  Understood, yes.
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.389]  You know?
[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:24.530]  Yes, definitely understandable.
[01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:25.949]  We are definitely not pulling out.
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:32.210]  We are actually building this for our responders, for FEMA responders, other federal agencies.
[01:04:32.889 --> 01:04:42.489]  We have several of these sites around the area to help Volunteer agencies as well that need lodging that are coming in to help the survivors in the local area.
[01:04:42.909 --> 01:04:45.309]  So that's what this is being stood up for.
[01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:48.750]  So this will be for the folks that have lost everything, they need a place to stay kind of thing?
[01:04:48.849 --> 01:04:51.409]  This is for the responders that are helping those folks.
[01:04:52.090 --> 01:05:00.309]  We are building these to stay out of the local hotels so that the survivors have the ability to stay in the local hotels.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.239]  Oh, okay.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:01.619]  Yes.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.119]  Now, is there money being provided to the survivors to accommodate hotel?
[01:05:05.679 --> 01:05:06.659]  Yes, there is.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.099]  That is not my area.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.699]  That's our individual assistance and the whole other side of FEMA. Okay.
[01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:15.900]  Our focus is really on this side to try to do the back-end support for the operation.
[01:05:16.019 --> 01:05:20.019]  And so how many responders will you house here, and how long do you think your response will be?
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.760]  We're building this to come up to 700 people.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.199]  Okay.
[01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:26.719]  And right now, how long it's going to be, we're unsure.
[01:05:27.139 --> 01:05:27.380]  Okay.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.400]  It's really a number for us at this point.
[01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:34.510]  They're going to be there long enough to require tornado shelters.
[01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:38.469]  Are you all expecting tornadoes here?
[01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.730]  We are not expecting tornadoes.
[01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:45.269]  Part of the package that goes out is to ensure that all the responders are safe.
[01:05:45.969 --> 01:05:48.409]  And there's nowhere for people to take cover here.
[01:05:48.809 --> 01:05:50.869]  So it's just part of the operation that goes out.
[01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.929]  And they're building at least two more just like it.
[01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:56.820]  Are you building another camp like this somewhere in North Carolina?
[01:05:57.179 --> 01:05:58.599]  We do have another one.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.639]  We actually have one in Flat Rock.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.820]  In Flat Rock, okay.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.679]  Yes, and then we're building another one up in Wilkes County.
[01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:06.019]  Oh, wow, okay.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:11.699]  Yep, so we are trying to ensure that there is coverage in the areas that we're most heavily damaged.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.159]  Why they are building these camps is yet to be discovered.
[01:06:15.619 --> 01:06:19.199]  Many are suggesting it's all part of a land grab for minerals.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.699]  But whatever it is, it does not look like help.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.860]  FEMA showed up.
[01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:28.909]  And spent a lot of taxpayer dollars.
[01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:30.309]  I wish I had a number for you.
[01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:31.849]  I'm just going to guess.
[01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:39.710]  50 million plus to provide a space for their workers to exist to help out sometime in the future.
[01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.750]  And that's what our federal government does.
[01:06:41.909 --> 01:06:42.670]  It spends money.
[01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:47.110]  As somebody said in the comments, they're a self-licking ice cream cone.
[01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.769]  They exist for themselves in and of themselves.
[01:06:51.489 --> 01:06:54.409]  What could 50 million dollars do for this area?
[01:06:54.809 --> 01:07:00.050]  How many generators could you purchase with 50 million dollars to help out those who need it?
[01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:02.349]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:03.389 --> 01:07:11.840]  You know, everything that's come into this area has been the goodwill of the citizens of this nation.
[01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:17.800]  The volunteers, the people that are donating clothes and food and money.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.639]  So many things to help out.
[01:07:23.059 --> 01:07:27.539]  And that's because you, the citizens, are doing that, not the federal government.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:34.440]  The federal government may be run by parasites and thieves, but the people have come together to offer help.
[01:07:34.659 --> 01:07:37.179]  Many people who showed up said, I had to do something.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.760]  God put it in my heart.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.260]  I had to come do something.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.219]  And they wanted to help.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:48.539]  And they've been able to put them to work, and they've organized it like a way I've never seen anything before in my life.
[01:07:48.699 --> 01:07:56.900]  I can't really speak to the FEMA part very much, but I do know that the local emergency managements have done an astounding job.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.840]  And we can still help.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:06.420]  There are wells to be dug to provide people with water at GoFundMe Western North Carolina Water Well Fund.
[01:08:07.139 --> 01:08:14.139]  And The Truth About Cancer have a Helene Relief fundraiser connected to people that are there and responding to people's needs.
[01:08:15.039 --> 01:08:17.739]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:08:21.739 --> 01:08:23.579]  All right, we're into hour number two.
[01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:29.239]  As soon as Trump gets up to speak tonight, we're going to be here still live for the next three hours.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.380]  We'll have Trump's speech.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.300]  Some of the other key ones there from Madison Square Garden in New York.
[01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:42.850]  According to the Democrats, in 5,000 plus articles this week, I have the article right here, 5,000 plus stories, news reports, you name it.
[01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:44.029]  It's Hitler!
[01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:52.149]  And we played a clip last hour, if you just tuned in, Tampon Tim said, that's Hitler, because he knows Hitler had a Nazi rally there.
[01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:58.390]  Hitler wasn't there, but there was an American Nazi party in 1939, and they rented it out and had a rally there, so that means he's Hitler.
[01:08:58.949 --> 01:09:05.539]  And that means everybody else that ever had a rally there is Hitler, too, including the DNC's been held there Five times?
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.319]  RNC four times?
[01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:08.060]  You can look it up.
[01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.739]  I was there in 2004 when the RNC was there.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.680]  I guess that means they're all Nazis.
[01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:15.439]  There was a Nazi there that night when I was there in 2004.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:21.180]  Arnold Schwarzenegger was promoting war and the homeland security and screw your freedom!
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:28.880]  His father was a Nazi and he told major newspapers back in the 70s that I like Hitler.
[01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:31.560]  He told people what to do and what to believe.
[01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:35.239]  But oh, he's a darling of the establishment.
[01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:40.859]  So the ADL likes real Nazis, they just call people that aren't Nazis, Nazis.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:54.979]  So, I got a bunch of clips and a bunch of news I want to hit, but during the break I was sitting here thinking, what do I really need to pull out of everything that's happening right now and say to the audience?
[01:09:57.439 --> 01:10:14.300]  From my research and total focus on things, and I think most of you already know this, you don't need me to tell you this, but for a lot of the new listeners tuning in, the corporate establishment's been hated for a long time, and the big banks know their time's coming to an end.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:26.399]  So they bet on a global collapse, they would blame on the environment and blame on viruses, that they would be the saviors during the collapse and put a total high-tech totalitarian control grid in place.
[01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:35.390]  That sounds just like the Mark of the Beast and operates just like the vision of John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos 2,000 years ago.
[01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:43.770]  But regardless of what you think is inspiring it, it's as bad as you could just ever even try to imagine.
[01:10:44.529 --> 01:10:45.970]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:49.689]  Everything the globalists are doing is falling apart.
[01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.170]  Everyone's turning against them.
[01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:54.630]  The system is in massive trouble and disarray.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:06.359]  And even if they killed Trump or were able to steal this election, which I don't think they're going to be successful doing, at least in the stealing part, everything backfires on them from that point.
[01:11:06.359 --> 01:11:11.239]  So any short-term winning a battle will still make them lose the war bigger.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:18.359]  And when you win a battle but lose the war, that's called a pyrrhic victory.
[01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:21.319]  Or you could even win a war, but it makes you collapse as well.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.760]  That's a pyrrhic victory as well.
[01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:27.350]  Pull up the history, type in history of the term Pyrrhic victory.
[01:11:28.609 --> 01:11:33.069]  And it goes back to the Greeks and then the Romans, but starts with the Greeks.
[01:11:34.649 --> 01:11:36.670]  So that's what this is.
[01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:41.649]  And I say that a lot because it's the truth for the listeners to have the good news, in my opinion.
[01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:43.189]  I mean, I'm not perfect.
[01:11:43.289 --> 01:11:43.869]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:11:44.069 --> 01:11:45.090]  I don't think so.
[01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:52.890]  And for the establishment who knows they're beaten to just stop it.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:12:02.100]  And they can keep their wealth and a bunch of other crap, but their whole agenda of depopulation and transhumanism and pedophilia, that's got to go away.
[01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:03.800]  And look, I know they're run by Satan.
[01:12:03.939 --> 01:12:04.640]  They're not going to stop.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:11.859]  But a lot of their minions and people that have been unconscious are going along because they believe it would get them ahead.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:22.220]  They need to know that the war against your tyranny has just begun and already things aren't going too well and all we're doing is putting numbers on the board against you.
[01:12:24.029 --> 01:12:25.409]  So that's the takeaway here.
[01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:28.909]  And again, I mentioned this last hour.
[01:12:29.029 --> 01:12:30.729]  I'll play the clip coming up if I play some others.
[01:12:31.449 --> 01:12:33.789]  Nick Foyntes is a smart guy.
[01:12:33.789 --> 01:12:37.890]  I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he has a right to free speech, and I agree with a lot of what he says.
[01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.069]  We should hear from everybody.
[01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:41.130]  He's saying Trump is sold out.
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:50.949]  And that this isn't like 2016, that people are refusing to endorse Kamala, the newspapers, and big billionaires are calling up to capitulate to Trump because Trump is sold out.
[01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.869]  No.
[01:12:52.930 --> 01:13:01.829]  They see the writing on the wall and globalism being in so much trouble, and so they're trying to now survive.
[01:13:02.729 --> 01:13:08.229]  Now, that doesn't mean there won't be a big fight with who Trump puts in, that the swamp isn't going to strike back in a lot of ways.
[01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:09.430]  It doesn't mean the war is won.
[01:13:10.279 --> 01:13:21.539]  But this is what victory looks like, is when Elon Musk sounds just like Alex Jones, and Tucker Carlson sounds just like Alex Jones, and Joe Rogan sounds just like Alex Jones.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:33.079]  So that is irrevocable damage to their entire agenda that you don't put back together again.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:41.260]  So the people fighting the globalist agenda, even if they tried to bring it back later, it's fried.
[01:13:41.579 --> 01:13:45.319]  I mean, these are grievous blows.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.699]  What is a grievous blow?
[01:13:49.199 --> 01:13:51.199]  It means one that could kill you.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.220]  Not a death blow, but one that could be.
[01:13:54.319 --> 01:13:55.640]  You're not sure if you're going to survive.
[01:13:56.739 --> 01:14:00.520]  And you add a bunch of grievous blows...
[01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:03.829]  Guys, give me definition of Pyrrhic victory, please.
[01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:04.949]  I have to see it on screen.
[01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:06.850]  Definition Pyrrhic victory.
[01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:09.609]  And then definition Grievous blow.
[01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:16.590]  Because I want people to really have that percolate into the noggin here.
[01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:26.810]  Because so many people sit on the fence because A, it's scary to admit all this, and then B, well, somebody might come after you if you stand up against it.
[01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:29.710]  The New World Order is coming after everybody.
[01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:35.239]  Elon Musk's brother almost died from the shot.
[01:14:35.479 --> 01:14:38.319]  They took his son away and have chemically castrated him.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.140]  He told you that's why he's pissed.
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.380]  A Pyrrhic victory is a victory that comes at such a great cost that it's tantamount to defeat.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.060]  The term can be used in military and non-military contexts.
[01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:59.500]  The term comes from King Cyrus of Ipharus, who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Ecclesiastes in 279 BC after the battle.
[01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:05.609]  Virus is said to have exclaimed, one more such victory and we are lost.
[01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:07.649]  There you go.
[01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:14.590]  So, when we can, let's put up the definition of grievous blow.
[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:17.550]  Grievous blow.
[01:15:18.029 --> 01:15:24.069]  You don't have grievous blows to the New World Order, a whole bunch of them, and take it back.
[01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:26.130]  It's a fact.
[01:15:27.219 --> 01:15:28.420]  It's seismic.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:41.319]  The hottest issues are waking up to the New World Order, the corporations, the poison food, the water, the predatory, psychotic big pharma, big food, big agra, big insurance.
[01:15:41.319 --> 01:15:45.100]  You don't put these genies back in the bottle.
[01:15:45.979 --> 01:15:49.600]  A grievous blow is a loss or equivalent that is extremely serious or worrying.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.960]  For example, the loss would be grievous blow to our engineering industries.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.500]  Here are Some of the ways it's used.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.180]  So, again, Grievous is super powerful.
[01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:05.819]  Devastating.
[01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:13.420]  And you add enough Grievous blows in, that's not death by a thousand cuts.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:22.039]  You get three Grievous blows, unless you're Popeye or the Hulk or Superman, you're out.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.380]  Sometimes one grievous is enough.
[01:16:25.619 --> 01:16:28.239]  Even the toughest can't take seven or eight grievous blows.
[01:16:29.399 --> 01:16:33.140]  Grievous, grievous, grievous, grievous.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.819]  Bottom line, we are beating the living snot out of the New World Order.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.779]  We're breaking jaws.
[01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:41.420]  We're breaking necks.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.819]  We're breaking arms.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.859]  We're stomping livers out on the ground.
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.060]  We're pulling hearts out of chest beating.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.819]  And we're just getting started.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.020]  Humanity is easy to beat when we're asleep.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.340]  We ain't asleep no more.
[01:16:56.119 --> 01:16:58.000]  The New World Order thought all their intimidation.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.960]  In fact, I got an Eddie Bravo clip from dinner last night.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.039]  He was here for Joe's show.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.039]  Went out to dinner.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.039]  Called me.
[01:17:04.279 --> 01:17:06.640]  And at the end of dinner, I said, you got to say this on camera.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.079]  And he's like, no, no, no, no.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.659]  And he was saying something everybody already knows.
[01:17:10.779 --> 01:17:12.340]  But he was talking about Joe behind the scenes.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:17.220]  And now, Joe knew all this stuff decades ago, as I've told you.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.380]  But was trying to, like, play it safe.
[01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:32.149]  And when they came after him publicly and behind the scenes the last few years, he's like fire-breathing now behind the scenes, totally awake, totally pissed, and doing it his way, unpacking him on air.
[01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:34.609]  Oh, I'm nonpartisan!
[01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:36.470]  While he just devastates them.
[01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.550]  And that's what you're going to see more of.
[01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:41.010]  So let him do it his way.
[01:17:41.489 --> 01:17:42.890]  But I forgot to give you the clip, guys.
[01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:43.409]  It's in my phone.
[01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:44.289]  I shot it last night.
[01:17:45.069 --> 01:17:46.170]  I want to put that out.
[01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:48.369]  Maybe put some graphics on it or something, or bugs on it.
[01:17:48.449 --> 01:17:49.890]  We'll put it on X. But yeah.
[01:17:51.730 --> 01:17:54.750]  The globalists messed with Joe Rogan.
[01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.029]  We'll say effed with Joe Rogan.
[01:17:56.109 --> 01:18:00.449]  The globalists tried to intimidate Joe Rogan and created a monster.
[01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:10.949]  And then Eddie keeps asking the question, why would they think that would, like, I could have told the globalists, like, oh, you're going to start really messing with him, huh?
[01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:13.829]  You're going to start messing with him, right?
[01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:17.310]  You're going to do stuff behind the scenes and threaten him?
[01:18:19.079 --> 01:18:25.199]  People don't know this, I've never said it on air, but part of the big threats was concerning me.
[01:18:26.979 --> 01:18:29.420]  And you better not do this, you better not do that.
[01:18:29.659 --> 01:18:33.739]  And they did some legal stuff behind the scenes of Joe that he didn't like too much.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.220]  And boy, how did that work out for you?
[01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:45.300]  See, you think we're one of these lawyers or globalists that's been groveling to the system and trying to social climb and trying to be part of the new world order.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.399]  No, we're trying to build our own thing and be free from you.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:53.560]  And then when you mess with people like me or Joe Rogan, then you get a fight!
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.819]  See how that works, dumbasses?
[01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:59.579]  Then you get the gloves come off.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.859]  The can of whoop-ass gets opened up.
[01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:05.680]  So, that's my message to everybody.
[01:19:05.819 --> 01:19:07.399]  I mean, they thought messing with...
[01:19:07.399 --> 01:19:13.420]  I mean, his ex gets him to authorize sending his firstborn son, Elon Musk.
[01:19:14.199 --> 01:19:14.920]  His favorite.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.000]  Obviously he loves kids.
[01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:18.100]  He's got like 10 or 11 of them.
[01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.000]  And he practices what he preaches.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.960]  And he goes to some elitist, leftist school.
[01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:28.899]  And the next, they take him away from him and say he's a girl and start sterilizing him chemically.
[01:19:30.579 --> 01:19:32.340]  And as Elon said, they murdered my son.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.119]  They murdered his identity.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.020]  They murdered who he was.
[01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:36.199]  And so Elon said, okay, I'm going to attack you.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.960]  And then he started attacking him and they attacked him more.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.880]  And he said, go F yourself.
[01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.380]  How did that work out?
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:54.199]  Like, I could have told the New World Order, hey, you might want to pass over Elon Musk's son, might not want to grab that one in your jaws, and start the murder process of his identity, his genetic future.
[01:19:54.939 --> 01:19:58.319]  Because that's true murder, is to castrate somebody, to take their seed.
[01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:01.000]  So see...
[01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:04.569]  That's how this works.
[01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:10.710]  So there are a lot of men in the world, and women, who are on the sideline trying to stay out of the fight.
[01:20:11.029 --> 01:20:18.289]  But wait, there's a meme, wait till the establishment starts running into the people that just wanted to be left alone.
[01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:30.029]  And my favorite one is an image from First Blood, that great movie, great director, great writer, Sylvester Stallone, great actor, when he's doing serious roles like that.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:49.069]  of John Rambo and it's the image of the sheriff when he's grabbing him by the arm about to arrest him for trying to get something to eat in the town and the meme says wait until the system Starts messing with the people that just want to be left alone.
[01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:51.689]  Well, we're well into that now.
[01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:54.210]  So good luck, New World Order.
[01:20:54.329 --> 01:20:55.430]  So this wasn't a pep talk.
[01:20:55.569 --> 01:20:56.850]  This wasn't a rah-rah thing here.
[01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.850]  As negative as the news is, I cover a lot.
[01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:08.090]  I really think, I know, I should be balancing it out and telling you why the system's so stirred up like a beehive and running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:11.130]  It's because they're getting the living hell kicked out of them.
[01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:19.869]  So before the hour ends, here guys, send Jason here.
[01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:24.289]  I'll find the video here for him.
[01:21:24.609 --> 01:21:26.390]  Have him grab this off my phone.
[01:21:28.569 --> 01:21:32.250]  Have him grab this.
[01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:40.289]  It's the video last night with Eddie Bravo.
[01:21:40.289 --> 01:21:41.210]  There's only one.
[01:21:42.029 --> 01:21:45.880]  It's No, it was after he was on Rogue and went to dinner.
[01:21:48.399 --> 01:21:49.859]  Yeah, I'm not going to just get off the phone.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.520]  It'll be higher res.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.600]  I'm trying to find...
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.380]  You know, I'll just give it to you during the break.
[01:21:55.319 --> 01:21:56.220]  I'm trying to find it here.
[01:21:58.439 --> 01:21:59.840]  I had to shoot video of that.
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.380]  No, that's in the studio.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.579]  Did I not shoot video of that?
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.100]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:22:12.659 --> 01:22:13.520]  Oh yeah, here it is.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.520]  Alright, anyways, I'll give it to you.
[01:22:15.859 --> 01:22:16.979]  It's just a fun video.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:22.399]  So, let me get back into the news here, because I need to hit everything I just mentioned.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:32.119]  I need to show the election fraud, they're catching the Democrats all over the country with just massive election fraud systems, caught in them red-handed trying to have illegal aliens vote.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.140]  But let's go ahead and get into Trump.
[01:22:35.279 --> 01:22:40.710]  Let's go ahead and play We have a problem with the enemy within.
[01:22:40.949 --> 01:22:41.890]  They keep saying that to the American people.
[01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:45.829]  No, he's talking about the globalists undermining the country, its borders, its currency, its culture.
[01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:47.390]  That's the enemy within.
[01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:48.569]  Here's President Trump.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.659]  And I say it to people.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.979]  We have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within.
[01:22:56.979 --> 01:22:59.159]  And it drives them crazy when I use that term.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.159]  But we have an enemy from within.
[01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:07.159]  We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful.
[01:23:07.819 --> 01:23:23.560]  When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe, when you have people coming in that when other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murderers, We had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.760]  And 15,000 rapists.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.420]  Convicted.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.319]  Rapists.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:27.819]  Yeah.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.039]  Drug dealers.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.100]  Drug lords.
[01:23:30.119 --> 01:23:32.199]  And that's just the ones that have been accounted for.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:32.739]  Correct.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.159]  People from mental institutions.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.720]  What do you think this strategy is?
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.479]  Hundreds of thousands of major criminals.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.739]  Tougher and worse than anybody we have.
[01:23:43.859 --> 01:23:45.359]  We're seeing the consequences of it.
[01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:47.560]  In San Antonio, they've taken over apartment buildings.
[01:23:47.659 --> 01:23:49.859]  In Aurora, Colorado, they've taken over apartment buildings.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.220]  These Venezuelan gangs.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:51.720]  Just to begin.
[01:23:51.779 --> 01:23:52.619]  People to survive.
[01:23:52.899 --> 01:23:53.579]  Well, it is.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:53.800]  Yeah.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:54.960]  It certainly is.
[01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:56.819]  So you're in there.
[01:23:56.939 --> 01:23:58.920]  You have 10,000 appointments you have to make.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.420]  So you're getting advice from people.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.760]  Did you have a moment in time where you realized, like, these are bad choices?
[01:24:07.979 --> 01:24:09.539]  Like, some of these people I shouldn't have had in there.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:18.619]  Oh yeah, I think, so the one question that you'll ask me, that I think you'll ask me, that people seem to ask, and I always come up with the same answer.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.119]  The one mistake, because I had a lot of success.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.699]  Great economy, great everything.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.500]  Everything was great.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:32.760]  The military rebuilt it, biggest tax cuts in history, all of a sudden we had a great presidency.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.439]  Three Supreme Court justices, most people get none.
[01:24:36.579 --> 01:24:37.420]  You know, you pick them young.
[01:24:38.449 --> 01:24:40.149]  This way they're there for 50 years, right?
[01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:45.369]  So, you know, even if a president is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance.
[01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.909]  I had three.
[01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:47.569]  It was sort of the luck of the draw.
[01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:52.829]  But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer.
[01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:56.310]  The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people.
[01:24:56.449 --> 01:24:59.949]  I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that.
[01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:03.250]  I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked.
[01:25:03.289 --> 01:25:06.770]  I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked.
[01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.949]  Neocons?
[01:25:08.569 --> 01:25:12.390]  Yeah, neocons, or bad people, or disloyal people, or...
[01:25:12.409 --> 01:25:15.930]  People that were just bad because you got bad advice.
[01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:18.789]  Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, you're reading about him a little bit today.
[01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:23.609]  A guy like Kelly who was a bully, a bully but a weak person, you know.
[01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:30.250]  You know more about bullies than anybody probably around because you deal in a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly.
[01:25:30.449 --> 01:25:33.149]  But, you know, he's bad.
[01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:39.069]  Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton.
[01:25:39.289 --> 01:25:40.090]  You know John Bolton?
[01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.890]  A friend of my...
[01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:45.510]  So, Trump knows what's going on now, and he's in longer speech as pledged to really get rid of the swamp.
[01:25:45.609 --> 01:25:45.909]  We'll see.
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:46.529]  We'll see.
[01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:53.310]  And I'll get to those clips coming up with what Fuentes is saying about it, which I think is important to look at, but I don't agree that the sellout's happening.
[01:25:53.729 --> 01:25:55.310]  No, it's called the collapse.
[01:25:55.409 --> 01:25:56.350]  It's called the capitulation.
[01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.689]  It's called the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:25:58.029 --> 01:26:01.689]  And then Trump shouldn't take any of those rats coming up and cozying up to him right now.
[01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:07.649]  I mean, you know Bill Gates will try to cozy up when he's been working behind the scenes against Trump, and 50 million to Kamala's just tip of the iceberg.
[01:26:08.239 --> 01:26:09.180]  No, I'm not political.
[01:26:09.439 --> 01:26:10.699]  So look for all of that.
[01:26:11.319 --> 01:26:14.520]  Here is Trump on World War III and Kamala, which is dead on.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:21.300]  To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions of people.
[01:26:21.659 --> 01:26:27.920]  She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:33.020]  She's not gonna be able to deal with President Xi or Putin or Kim Jong-un or anybody.
[01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:41.460]  And then all of your sons and daughters will end up getting drafted to go fight for a war in a country that you've never heard of.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.859]  Our enemies are laughing at her.
[01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:45.079]  They're laughing at us.
[01:26:45.579 --> 01:26:48.399]  But if we win, our enemies won't be laughing anymore.
[01:26:48.439 --> 01:26:50.899]  I tell you, they're not going to be laughing anymore.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.659]  Alright, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.560]  I have to talk about this because it's a big deal.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:07.640]  The Democratic Party has spent $75 million in the last six years trying to shut us down.
[01:27:08.079 --> 01:27:10.359]  We've spent $15 million fighting them off.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.199]  Nobody's survived this long except for Trump.
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.399]  You've seen what they've done to all the other big top Trump people.
[01:27:15.619 --> 01:27:17.880]  Prison time, totally destroyed, everything taken.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.239]  You name it.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.100]  But we've stayed on air.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:31.010]  But on the 13th, The feds, that's how the federal system works, have a federal trustee that's in control of the sale of Infowars.
[01:27:31.409 --> 01:27:35.569]  And he promised he wouldn't do this when the Democrats asked for this in court on June 14th.
[01:27:35.729 --> 01:27:45.729]  But now he doubled back two weeks ago and said, yeah, we're going to sell the name Alex Jones and his real Alex Jones X account when you can't do that.
[01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:46.890]  The term of service say you can't.
[01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.090]  The law says I own my name, my likeness.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.140]  It would repeal the 13th Amendment.
[01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.060]  But I have to fight that in court.
[01:27:53.239 --> 01:27:55.720]  Now on Friday, the judge said, nope, I'm not doing that.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.060]  I'm ordering a full hearing.
[01:27:57.859 --> 01:28:01.920]  And so I've got the lawyers ready, all the presentations, countersuits, all that stuff ready.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.000]  You'll see it next week.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.939]  A bunch of action for me.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:05.859]  You want action?
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.680]  Not just on this, but on the underlying everything.
[01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:11.489]  You're about to see it.
[01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:13.989]  But it takes money to do this.
[01:28:14.409 --> 01:28:15.729]  And so you want me to fight?
[01:28:15.729 --> 01:28:16.949]  I can't do it without you.
[01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:17.670]  I want to fight.
[01:28:17.989 --> 01:28:22.529]  Plus, we need to have sponsors for the crew to be rehired if we're shut down and studio and all that.
[01:28:23.710 --> 01:28:24.829]  They're great products.
[01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:25.550]  You need them.

[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:53.109]  So you buy the product, you get an extra $10.
[01:28:54.489 --> 01:29:10.630]  And you get extra specials, extra sales that only you get, and extra offers, including special supplements, t-shirts, knives, a bunch of stuff that will only be available to people that are in the VIP. It is one of the best VIP programs out there.

[01:29:47.029 --> 01:29:51.630]  But I will tell you, more than half the money is going to legal, which we couldn't do without you.

[01:31:55.670 --> 01:32:05.109]  Alright, I want to get into the election fraud happening where they're catching people canvassing for Democrat voters everywhere and they mix in some real ones but 60 plus percent are fake.
[01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:06.829]  And they're catching them in Colorado.
[01:32:06.829 --> 01:32:09.569]  They're catching them in Pennsylvania, Georgia.
[01:32:09.569 --> 01:32:10.750]  It's coming in everywhere.
[01:32:11.289 --> 01:32:12.649]  And they're catching them.
[01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:18.069]  And they will just go and put in voter registration requests to be put on the voter rolls.
[01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:19.369]  This has happened in the last few months.
[01:32:19.489 --> 01:32:20.170]  Now they're catching them.
[01:32:21.069 --> 01:32:24.229]  And thousands and thousands per county.
[01:32:24.369 --> 01:32:25.369]  It's happening all over the place.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:31.380]  And when they run it through the database or check it, there's not even signatures or they're wrong signatures or they're fake names.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.380]  And that's how the Democrats do it.
[01:32:33.439 --> 01:32:37.000]  They just pay all these groups to go out and do this and flood the system.
[01:32:37.539 --> 01:32:41.359]  And then if they get caught, well, those groups go to jail because they're the ones that did it.
[01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:51.130]  So, it's a big deal, but the landslide's so big, the Democrats are now saying they're going to hold up the election, but that probably won't even work.
[01:32:51.210 --> 01:33:08.430]  They're going to try to stir up a civil war, use some crisis, use some violence they either gin up or actually do themselves, but they're hedging their bets now where these newspapers won't endorse Kamala, the Washington Post, LA Times, hundreds of others, and yeah, now a bunch of these big billionaires are saying,
[01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:09.710]  actually, we're not Trump's enemy.
[01:33:10.699 --> 01:33:13.760]  Because they still want to have a, quote, seat at the table in this.
[01:33:13.979 --> 01:33:16.579]  That doesn't mean they've compromised or Trump's sold out.
[01:33:16.739 --> 01:33:21.939]  It means they're coming with hat in hand, at least on the surface, probably a knife in the other hand.
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:25.279]  Or they reach out to shake his hand with one hand and stab him with another.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.520]  But McFointez thinks, no, that's the sign of capitulation.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.140]  Well, we should keep Trump's feet to the fire.
[01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:32.159]  We should watch what happens.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.180]  The key is, who he's bringing in right now is great.
[01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:46.930]  We're good to go.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:57.319]  But if he doesn't keep all the neocons and leftists out of his administration, not just his cabinet, they're going to lie about him and leak fake stuff.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:04.579]  So Trump has an incentive of self-preservation, what he's doing not to bring these folks in.
[01:34:04.699 --> 01:34:05.640]  Isn't that common sense?
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.619]  But we're about to find out.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.739]  And if he starts bringing in some bad people, we'll flip out about it.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.859]  And if he doesn't remove them, then we'll know we've got a problem.
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:14.819]  And here's another thing.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:54.229]  The good guys, like Kennedy, like Gabbards, like many others, they're going to have the FBI, just like with General Flynn, trying to shut And I disagree with
[01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:56.789]  his postulation that the sellouts already happened.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.680]  And, you know, things like that.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:04.779]  And like, oh, well, J.D. Vance is backed by Peter Thiel, and well, you know, there's a bunch of...
[01:35:04.779 --> 01:35:13.279]  Yeah, who was for Trump the first time, and was not with the main deep state.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:20.399]  I mean, you can say, you know, Thiel's involved in the surveillance grid, selling equipment, and you can say he's in all this, but he's certainly not part...
[01:35:25.869 --> 01:35:27.689]  I'm glad J.D. Vance got back.
[01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:28.689]  I think he's a great choice.
[01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:31.250]  I mean, look at Elon Musk.
[01:35:31.449 --> 01:35:34.010]  I mean, you know, this is definitely a different power structure.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:49.479]  That's trying to come in and stop the total destruction of the world and stop World War III. And again, I'm not saying Musk or any of these people are perfect angels, but their actions, you can weigh them, and they are not even lesser of two evils.
[01:35:49.579 --> 01:36:02.319]  They are light years better than the whole George Soros, King Charles, WEF group that's been just absolutely wrecking civilization.
[01:36:03.619 --> 01:36:04.180]  So...
[01:36:05.579 --> 01:36:06.939]  Courage is contagious, too.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:14.680]  And so the Elon Musk we've got today is 100 degrees different than he was because he wasn't pure bad before.
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:16.560]  He was kind of in between.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.880]  Well, now, I mean, the guy's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:26.199]  So, I mean, it's just so obvious to me because all I do is study policy and actions and, you know, look at it.
[01:36:27.539 --> 01:36:29.159]  Yeah, let's just do the Nick Foyntes thing now.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.619]  I'm already into this, and then I'll play the Eddie Bravo thing I just mentioned.
[01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:32.979]  Let's go ahead.
[01:36:33.119 --> 01:36:34.180]  Here's Nick Foyntes.
[01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:36.430]  Question is who benefits?
[01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:42.789]  Yeah, Trump administration, again, he's going to be better at administering the government, but for who?
[01:36:43.069 --> 01:36:43.890]  For whom?
[01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:50.609]  He will be better at administering the government for the rich, for the firm.
[01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.510]  It's not even all the rich people.
[01:36:52.689 --> 01:36:54.470]  I'm a little bit rich.
[01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:55.909]  It's not going to be better for me.
[01:36:56.569 --> 01:36:58.470]  It's going to be better for the firm owners.
[01:36:59.289 --> 01:37:02.479]  It's going to be better for The immigrants.
[01:37:03.119 --> 01:37:09.779]  And for the working people, for the people specifically that study STEM, this is one example, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:37:11.249 --> 01:37:14.710]  So, this is your Trump campaign, and that's the change that occurred.
[01:37:14.869 --> 01:37:18.130]  In 2016, it was about Trump and the forgotten Americans.
[01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:19.909]  Now he forgot those people, too.
[01:37:20.449 --> 01:37:22.510]  In 2016, he was our voice.
[01:37:22.649 --> 01:37:23.850]  Now he's their voice.
[01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:27.770]  Now when he goes out and says green cards for everybody, that's Elon Musk talking.
[01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:30.069]  DeSantis would have said the same thing.
[01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:34.609]  DeSantis would have said the same thing, and Elon initially supported DeSantis.
[01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:38.270]  Whoever got Elon's money would be saying the same thing.
[01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:44.890]  Do you think that if Trump were saying that we wouldn't bring in more green cards, that Elon would still be supporting him?
[01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:48.510]  You think he'd be giving him $75 million?
[01:37:51.789 --> 01:37:56.949]  Do you think that if Trump were saying we weren't going to support Israel, that Jacob Hellberg would be giving him money?
[01:37:57.149 --> 01:37:57.750]  Probably not.
[01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:58.550]  I don't think so.
[01:37:58.649 --> 01:37:59.630]  I think the answer is no.
[01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:05.270]  Do you think that if Trump weren't in favor of drill baby drill, that they'd be supporting him?
[01:38:05.369 --> 01:38:07.270]  They need that energy for the data centers.
[01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:10.350]  It's interest-based.
[01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.630]  And that's the problem.
[01:38:11.909 --> 01:38:13.869]  It used to be Trump for the people.
[01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:17.029]  Now it's Trump for the donors to put up the money for his campaign.
[01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:18.770]  It wasn't like that in 2016.
[01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:20.590]  Or at least it didn't seem like that.
[01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:22.170]  Maybe it was like that the whole time.
[01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:25.390]  But this is going to be a different administration.
[01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:29.250]  Don't expect it to be more based than the kind of rhetoric we're getting right now.
[01:38:29.369 --> 01:38:30.130]  It's going to be worse.
[01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:32.449]  So...
[01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:38.930]  All right, so I'm going to invite Nick on this week, as soon as he can come on.
[01:38:39.729 --> 01:38:46.390]  But we should probably, don't even do it on the main show, we should do like three-hour discussion, call a debate if you want, and then I'll air it on the show the next day.
[01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:48.970]  So we have commercial-free, if he wants to come here, that'd be great.
[01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:50.310]  We'll pay for his plane ticket.
[01:38:52.890 --> 01:39:00.390]  I think I agree with about half of that, but Trump's bad to...
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:09.060]  Open the Keystone pipeline and then get all of the oil drilling and gas drilling permits that Biden killed opened?
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:21.529]  That's not going to help Us get cheaper energy, that's not going to help the millions of jobs associated with that, hundreds of thousands of energy, and then all the jobs around that.
[01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:28.609]  I know Nick's smart, but I mean, as Trump always says, energy being cheap is the number one thing to drive down inflation.
[01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:34.109]  And it's already so out of control, he's not going to reverse it, but you can stop its growth.
[01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:37.210]  Trump says he can cut energy in half.
[01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.930]  He can do that.
[01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:38.569]  I've looked at the numbers.
[01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:45.109]  How would energy being half the cost it is now, how would that do for you?
[01:39:46.090 --> 01:39:48.350]  Oh, that's going to help the oil companies.
[01:39:49.069 --> 01:39:52.090]  Most of the oil companies are supporting the carbon taxes and all that crap.
[01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:53.930]  They're owned by the big banks.
[01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:59.050]  And so, yeah, everybody knows Trump's not anti-Israel, okay?
[01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:02.010]  And then, is that a secret?
[01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:04.229]  It's not like some new policy.
[01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:11.449]  And then, Trump's gotten roughly 10% of his donations from big billionaires.
[01:40:12.989 --> 01:40:18.810]  The Democrats have gotten 90 plus percent of their money, look it up, from the rich.
[01:40:19.949 --> 01:40:27.289]  There's never in a presidential election, not even in 2016, been all the big money on the Democrats the way it is now.
[01:40:27.369 --> 01:40:28.670]  I mean, they always have got the big money.
[01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:34.449]  They used to get like 60%, 65% in an election with George Herbert Walker Bush or George W. or that crap.
[01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:51.489]  Now, over 90% is going to the Democrats, and so you can't point at Trump and say he's an elitist, and the entire corporate media, the universities, big tech except for X, the Justice Department coming after Trump.
[01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:57.270]  I mean, to say that Trump is the establishment is not true.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:02.319]  The entire bureaucracies absolutely hate his guts.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.760]  The legal system hates his guts because when he's the president, he tries to call the shots and they don't like that.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.560]  They want puppets.
[01:41:10.399 --> 01:41:13.000]  He's got trade deals that'll bring jobs back.
[01:41:13.239 --> 01:41:17.000]  I mean, it's night and day.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:28.270]  And they've tried to kill Trump twice and they've done all the rest of this stuff and I mean, I guess we could look at Musk and look at Trump and say, well, it's not perfect.
[01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:32.890]  Jesus didn't sit down and do this for us, like the 32 million Christians that aren't going to vote.
[01:41:33.829 --> 01:41:36.329]  Because Trump's never been a goody-two-shoes fake person.
[01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:43.050]  He believes in God, believes God's hands on him, and he doesn't lie about the fact that, you know, he's been out with a few ladies.
[01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:47.710]  So, if you're looking for a hypocrite, you're not going to get that from Trump.
[01:41:48.789 --> 01:41:51.430]  And so, that's where I stand on this.
[01:41:51.569 --> 01:41:52.630]  And, you know, I hear people...
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:00.840]  Out there who aren't prominent and don't know a lot of influential people.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.539]  And I'm not saying you're a lesser person.
[01:42:02.779 --> 01:42:08.520]  I'm just saying I've been doing this 30 years and I know the big players on the good guy team.
[01:42:08.779 --> 01:42:12.260]  And they are legitimately pissed behind the scenes.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:16.560]  They're legitimately worried about World War III. They're legitimately worried about societal collapse.
[01:42:17.619 --> 01:42:22.399]  Because of the globalist, anti-family, anti-God, anti-life, anti-human...
[01:42:23.329 --> 01:42:24.989]  Anti-growth agenda.
[01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:28.430]  Elon Musk wants a big, growing, pro-human economy.
[01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:32.569]  And yeah, he'll sell you robots and live extension at the same time.
[01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:33.529]  So is Trump.
[01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:40.909]  Trump wants golf courses and country clubs and high-rise apartments that are big and nice.
[01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:45.210]  Bloomberg and the globalists want 200 square foot coffin apartments where you eat bugs.
[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:47.789]  I mean, they're different people.
[01:42:47.989 --> 01:42:49.529]  It's different ideas.
[01:42:50.109 --> 01:43:01.560]  It's prosperity and And laissez-faire versus the great reset corporate Marxism, where they're above the law and ultra-rich but use communism to control us.
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:05.460]  And so the whole rotting globalist facade is falling.
[01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:09.029]  Finally, even Trump recognizes corporate media is dead.
[01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:10.210]  It has almost no viewers.
[01:43:10.569 --> 01:43:12.449]  And the final illusions are ending here.
[01:43:12.689 --> 01:43:18.029]  And so, yeah, there's a lot of people that have been in the establishment that are going to rush over and try to join Team Humanity right now.
[01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:19.430]  And it doesn't mean we trust them all.
[01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:20.489]  It doesn't mean everything's going to be perfect.
[01:43:20.609 --> 01:43:21.090]  It doesn't mean everything.
[01:43:21.289 --> 01:43:24.449]  But, you know, folks, you've got to be ready for winning.
[01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:27.270]  You've got to be ready for success.
[01:43:27.989 --> 01:43:31.170]  And we've moved the needle way, way back.
[01:43:32.529 --> 01:43:33.989]  In popularity for the New World Order.
[01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:40.170]  The New World Order is almost as unpopular as death and cancer.
[01:43:40.789 --> 01:43:44.069]  I mean, they are in the high 90s unpopular ability.
[01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:45.329]  Before they weren't even known.
[01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:50.470]  They just thought they'd scurry around above us and, you know, do the Great Reset and all this tyranny and we just go along with it.
[01:43:50.949 --> 01:43:52.989]  Trump's going to kill the central bank digital currency.
[01:43:53.329 --> 01:43:54.649]  He'll restrengthen the dollar.
[01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:56.210]  He'll do all this stuff.
[01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.810]  And again...
[01:43:57.989 --> 01:44:00.430]  The policies will cut taxes.
[01:44:00.710 --> 01:44:04.689]  The policies will help working poor and blue collar and middle class.
[01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:07.409]  The policies absolutely will make.
[01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:13.770]  I mean, the globalists didn't want Trump in despite the fact they made their biggest profits ever under Trump because it's just money to them.
[01:44:13.890 --> 01:44:17.590]  They want to take our money away because then their money is worth 10 times more.
[01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:24.310]  They don't want twice as much money and then we have twice as much because then they can't dictate total control over our lives.
[01:44:24.449 --> 01:44:34.359]  You know what the number one Economic, political, social system has been in the 7,000 years of recorded history of humans on this planet.
[01:44:34.539 --> 01:44:37.920]  You know what every system was until 500 years ago, right?
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:39.979]  Feudalism.
[01:44:40.239 --> 01:44:41.579]  And what is feudalism?
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:48.239]  Where an elite keeps people on very small pieces of land at a subsistence level as a tool of control.
[01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:56.510]  And so you can call these systems whatever you want, but I've been calling it for 25 years, neo-feudalistic fascism.
[01:44:56.689 --> 01:45:02.409]  That term is now in the vernacular, in the history books, in the political science books, used by Steve Banner, where else?
[01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:03.149]  That's my term.
[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:04.750]  I created that.
[01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:06.890]  Because I looked at the terms and said, that's what this is.
[01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:12.250]  So it's not like I sit here and tell you about political terms that are out there.
[01:45:12.369 --> 01:45:14.390]  I create the political terms.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:20.100]  See, the New World Order doesn't tell me what to do, and the good guys don't tell me what to do.
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.539]  I do the studying.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.659]  I have a big audience of smart activists that support us, an incredible guest.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.479]  We have talked about the real world and how it works.
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:35.779]  We have popularized understanding the globalist, horrible, post-industrial, anti-human depopulation model and said, gee, that sounds really horrible and unpopular.
[01:45:35.779 --> 01:45:50.920]  I bet if we expose that, when they go operational in 2000 with agenda 2030, out of agenda 2030, 21, from 1992 Rio de Janeiro UN plan, and limits to growth, and the Club of Rome,
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.739]  and the WF, you will eat the bugs, the future's not human.
[01:45:53.939 --> 01:46:03.680]  I bet if you put people choices out there and say, here's team humanity, here's prosperity, here's freedom, here's a future, people will bet for that instead of their new world order.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:09.279]  I mean, look, I never grew up thinking I was a salesman, but everything in life is being a salesman.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:11.399]  I mean, I'm selling freedom.
[01:46:11.579 --> 01:46:16.840]  I'm selling education, being informed, how the world works, street smarts, believing in humanity.
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.899]  I really like humans.
[01:46:17.899 --> 01:46:18.439]  I'm a human.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.399]  I don't believe your crap.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.500]  I don't believe your garbage.
[01:46:23.659 --> 01:46:25.899]  I don't believe our best days are behind us.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.359]  I don't believe all this crap.
[01:46:27.359 --> 01:46:36.439]  And I've seen the power of what we've done together on Access TV and talk radio and films and syndicated radio and the internet.
[01:46:36.779 --> 01:46:39.300]  And I've been attacked by the most powerful people in the world.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:41.579]  And because you back me, we're still on air.
[01:46:41.699 --> 01:46:42.119]  So...
[01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:45.430]  I've got a lot of confidence in you.
[01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:50.529]  I've got a lot of confidence in the God of the universe that made you and made me.
[01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:53.289]  I'm betting on you.
[01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:55.489]  And I'm betting you're like me.
[01:46:55.630 --> 01:46:56.909]  I don't look at focus groups.
[01:46:57.050 --> 01:46:58.409]  I don't look at Google Analytics.
[01:46:58.630 --> 01:47:01.090]  I don't look at the statistics, though I see them all in front of me.
[01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:03.489]  And it's always what I already know.
[01:47:03.949 --> 01:47:07.510]  I don't need to know 80-plus percent in every poll or against open borders.
[01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.649]  I'm surprised there's 15-20 percent that are that dumb.
[01:47:11.739 --> 01:47:13.079]  I don't need to know.
[01:47:13.359 --> 01:47:18.659]  90 plus percent of Americans are against the transgender brainwashing or men and women's sports.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.619]  That's common sense.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.560]  I don't need to do a focus group.
[01:47:22.579 --> 01:47:26.699]  I don't need to get up here and think what do you want and then try to tell you that.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:33.060]  I get up here and have an inner dialogue about exactly what I'm thinking and it turns out you think just like me.
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:36.380]  You don't tune in here to be told what to think.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:49.460]  You tune in here because you know this is right and I can do this full time whereas some of you can't so you tune in to hear what I'm saying so you can look into it and a lot of times you call me or email me and you tell me what's going on.
[01:47:49.579 --> 01:47:50.619]  That's all this is.
[01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:56.970]  My ancestors weren't a bunch of jerks, a bunch of murdering Satanists, and I'm not either, and neither are you.
[01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.289]  We come from better people than that.
[01:47:59.409 --> 01:48:01.130]  We're not descended from fearful men.
[01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:05.489]  And I'm animated.
[01:48:05.489 --> 01:48:06.430]  I'm fired up.
[01:48:06.529 --> 01:48:10.689]  I told the globalists that famous speech 18 years ago that's been viral forever.
[01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:11.550]  New York City.
[01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:14.050]  At the premiere of Endgame.
[01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:16.630]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:19.069]  Hardly that film came out 18 years ago.
[01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:22.409]  And I said, I don't know how all this is going to end.
[01:48:22.590 --> 01:48:24.510]  And that wasn't some speechwriter who told me that.
[01:48:24.829 --> 01:48:26.210]  That just comes out of my heart.
[01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:28.430]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:31.930]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:33.310]  Now, that's a true statement.
[01:48:35.329 --> 01:48:42.229]  And I could have hung my spurs up 18 years ago after already being on air for over 12 years and said I gave them a good lick.
[01:48:42.529 --> 01:48:44.390]  I hit them upside the head hard.
[01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:45.789]  I've done my job.
[01:48:45.869 --> 01:48:46.970]  I can leave.
[01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.569]  Nope.
[01:48:49.369 --> 01:48:49.770]  Nope.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:52.940]  No.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.340]  I've just started to fight.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.199]  I've only begun to fight.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.960]  And that's where we are.
[01:49:01.079 --> 01:49:02.020]  I know you've only begun to fight.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:03.439]  So...
[01:49:03.439 --> 01:49:06.819]  We're living in extremely incredible, interesting times.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.579]  Explosive times.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.699]  Dangerous times.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:11.380]  Wonderful times.
[01:49:11.539 --> 01:49:12.100]  Beautiful times.
[01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:12.460]  Everything.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.619]  Best of times.
[01:49:13.699 --> 01:49:14.140]  Worst of times.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:15.300]  Tell the two cities.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.500]  As I say every day.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.100]  And that's where we are.
[01:49:18.279 --> 01:49:18.520]  And...
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.119]  I'm a leader.
[01:49:22.659 --> 01:49:23.560]  You're a leader.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:40.479]  A leader, a real leader, does their research, works hard, stands for something, is loyal to their people, and then doesn't care about being attacked and going with the crowd.
[01:49:40.479 --> 01:49:50.800]  A leader will tell the truth and go against the grain and against the flow, even if they get destroyed, because real leadership comes from the compendium of doing what's right in front of God.
[01:49:53.579 --> 01:49:58.420]  And so I'm not here getting orders from anybody.
[01:49:59.779 --> 01:50:01.199]  I give the orders.
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:15.300]  More than anybody else on the planet today, what we talk about, what we develop, the terms, the ideas on this broadcast, and the enemy has said this and they know it, become the talking points of the global resistance.
[01:50:16.039 --> 01:50:17.659]  I give the orders.
[01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:20.680]  And you know who else gives the orders?
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:21.720]  You.
[01:50:22.359 --> 01:50:22.819]  You.
[01:50:23.039 --> 01:50:30.520]  When you speak out, when you post, when you pray, when you go speak at city council, when you support this broadcast, the power comes from the people.
[01:50:31.079 --> 01:50:32.859]  Change comes from the grassroots.
[01:50:33.239 --> 01:50:34.640]  We are the resistance.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.779]  And resistance is victory.
[01:50:36.859 --> 01:50:38.399]  Because you never give up.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.760]  And you never back down.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:41.840]  And in the struggle, you get stronger.
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:44.760]  And you learn more.
[01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.229]  They're not gonna break our will.
[01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:50.529]  We're breaking their will.
[01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:54.930]  Now we're just in the danger of them clawing us into hell with them.
[01:50:56.970 --> 01:51:05.529]  And they think they can intimidate you and I. And that we're just gonna sit here and roll over to a hell worse than death.
[01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:11.250]  And turn our children and our bodies and our culture and our souls over to them.
[01:51:11.409 --> 01:51:11.750]  No!
[01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:14.010]  This fight isn't a burden.
[01:51:16.659 --> 01:51:18.619]  This fight is a blessing.
[01:51:18.819 --> 01:51:20.420]  It is our testament.
[01:51:20.439 --> 01:51:21.720]  It is our challenge.
[01:51:21.899 --> 01:51:23.100]  It is who we are.
[01:51:23.619 --> 01:51:24.859]  It was the best of times.
[01:51:24.859 --> 01:51:25.579]  Put that back up.
[01:51:25.659 --> 01:51:26.140]  Tell Two Cities.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.380]  Charles Dickens, one of the greatest writers ever.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:29.779]  It was the best of times.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.739]  It was the worst of times.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.720]  It was the age of wisdom.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.039]  It was the age of foolishness.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.680]  It was the epoch of belief.
[01:51:35.699 --> 01:51:37.619]  It was the epoch of incredibility.
[01:51:38.319 --> 01:51:39.739]  It was the season of light.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:40.939]  It was the season of darkness.
[01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:42.460]  It was the spring of hope.
[01:51:42.539 --> 01:51:43.680]  It was the winter of our despair.
[01:51:44.670 --> 01:51:46.449]  Here's Eddie Bravo last night at dinner.
[01:51:46.989 --> 01:51:47.369]  Here it is.
[01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:50.029]  Eddie Bravo.
[01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:51.590]  Yo, I don't know nothing.
[01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:53.909]  I love Kamala and Walsh.
[01:51:54.029 --> 01:51:58.909]  I'm going for Kamala and Walsh because they have such great policies.
[01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:00.710]  You were just on the JRE tonight.
[01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.470]  Yes.
[01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:03.869]  And we were talking about how they tried to harass me and make me quit and work.
[01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:05.289]  Russell Brand didn't work.
[01:52:05.409 --> 01:52:07.170]  And also they went after Joe and it did what?
[01:52:08.329 --> 01:52:09.770]  They turned him into a monster.
[01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:12.449]  Every time they go after somebody, it doesn't work.
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:13.909]  They went after you like a monster.
[01:52:14.899 --> 01:52:17.140]  You're still yipping in the yapping every day.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:26.600]  At one point, at some point, they got to figure out, like, damn, if we go after these guys, it just makes them even worse.
[01:52:26.899 --> 01:52:29.199]  So they got strategy.
[01:52:29.479 --> 01:52:32.460]  They think we're like the lawyers and the scum that work for them.
[01:52:32.659 --> 01:52:34.579]  They start messing with real red-blooded people.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.420]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.739]  Hey listen, I'm just trying to live my life.
[01:52:39.979 --> 01:52:43.819]  I hope Kamala has a good Christmas.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:51.079]  And Tim Walz, Tampon Tim, I hope he has a fabulous holiday.
[01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:54.529]  No, but be right.
[01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:55.590]  I mean, they did mess with Joe.
[01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:57.810]  When he wasn't even going after him, that didn't work too well.
[01:52:58.529 --> 01:53:00.630]  Every time they go after somebody, it doesn't work out.
[01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:01.829]  They went after Russell Brand.
[01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:02.149]  What happened?
[01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:03.270]  They went after Elon Musk.
[01:53:03.569 --> 01:53:04.689]  Tried to bully him three years ago.
[01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:05.310]  How'd that turn out?
[01:53:05.449 --> 01:53:06.430]  That didn't turn out too good.
[01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:08.130]  Who is running this?
[01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:10.829]  Yo, we gotta stop going after these m******s.
[01:53:10.829 --> 01:53:12.170]  It just makes them into monsters.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:14.579]  Right?
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:16.520]  Look at you.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:18.840]  They went after you harder than anybody.
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:20.680]  And you weren't shutting the f*** up.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.920]  You're louder than ever.
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:24.060]  Yeah, we reached about 30 million people a day now.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:24.899]  And you're bigger than ever.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.119]  Like, at some point, you would think like, okay, we got to rethink this.
[01:53:29.989 --> 01:53:30.909]  What's your take on this?
[01:53:31.170 --> 01:53:36.670]  I think that the power goes to the people, and that they try to silence people, and it just backfires.
[01:53:36.909 --> 01:53:39.329]  And more people come together, and more people come to Trump.
[01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:41.949]  You're making a good point about how it's an illusion of power.
[01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:43.970]  They only have the illusion of control, right?
[01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:47.649]  And once that illusion is gone, then the real power comes back to the people.
[01:53:47.770 --> 01:53:49.609]  There's way more of us than there is of them.
[01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:52.529]  And when we all collectively come together, we can destroy them.
[01:53:52.949 --> 01:53:53.689]  And we are.
[01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:54.750]  It's a great awakening.
[01:53:54.930 --> 01:53:55.750]  It's a great awakening.
[01:53:55.949 --> 01:53:56.649]  And we're winning.
[01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:57.489]  Eddie?
[01:53:58.199 --> 01:53:58.779]  Anything else?
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.439]  It is The Great Awakening.
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:02.720]  Alright, so there you go.
[01:54:02.819 --> 01:54:03.939]  That's on X Exclusive.
[01:54:04.899 --> 01:54:05.619]  Eddie Bravo.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.539]  Let's put it back on screen.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.779]  I want to read the headline I wrote earlier.
[01:54:08.239 --> 01:54:10.819]  Eddie Bravo reveals the deep state's harassment of Joe Rogan.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:13.020]  Turned him into a monster.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:13.859]  Oh my goodness.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:16.739]  Dumbasses.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.359]  Alright, look, I already covered it last night in the Emergency Saturday show.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.600]  Chase Guy has come up for two hours, got a big guest in the studio.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.800]  He'll get a lot of them into it.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.399]  But they caught him in a bunch of counties.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:35.680]  In Pennsylvania, Democrat groups going around, putting a bunch of fake voter registration requests in to be on the ballot.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.239]  They mixed in some real ones, but most of them were fake.
[01:54:38.359 --> 01:54:38.819]  They caught them.
[01:54:38.899 --> 01:54:39.239]  It's criminal.
[01:54:39.359 --> 01:54:39.760]  They got them.
[01:54:40.439 --> 01:54:41.920]  Fake signatures, all of it.
[01:54:42.659 --> 01:54:43.159]  The DAs.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.640]  And now it started in there.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:45.500]  Now it's all over the state.
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:46.140]  They're finding it.
[01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.640]  And so now the feds predicted this.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.479]  Someone hacked in and took down the state's database of whose real voters are not.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:53.300]  Oh, isn't that funny?
[01:54:53.659 --> 01:54:55.399]  Remember, months ago, they predicted that was going to happen.
[01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:57.250]  And then the feds did.
[01:54:57.489 --> 01:54:58.409]  Oh gosh, the Russians.
[01:54:58.590 --> 01:54:58.850]  Yeah, right.
[01:54:59.689 --> 01:55:02.289]  And then the same thing just now happened in Colorado.
[01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:05.130]  Thousands of ballots they're having to go through because they put fake ones in.
[01:55:05.449 --> 01:55:08.510]  They put people fake on the voter registration and fake ballots.
[01:55:08.949 --> 01:55:09.949]  And so it's on.
[01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:13.270]  So four years ago, they wouldn't even look at it.
[01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:14.829]  Oh, there's no such thing as fake ballots.
[01:55:14.970 --> 01:55:15.630]  It doesn't exist.
[01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:16.810]  Oh, it's all lies.
[01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:17.470]  Oh, please.
[01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:20.050]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:21.229]  And we know the illegals are voting.
[01:55:21.329 --> 01:55:21.869]  That's all coming in.
[01:55:21.930 --> 01:55:22.649]  You're like, well, it's terrible.
[01:55:22.869 --> 01:55:23.869]  Yeah, but at least we know now.
[01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:26.149]  See, we have the initiative.
[01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:29.449]  It gets worse for them every day, every month, every minute.
[01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:32.430]  All right, Chase Geyser's going to come in here.
[01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:34.949]  If your local station doesn't carry Sunite Live, it's from 6 to 8.
[01:55:34.989 --> 01:55:35.289]  You should.
[01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.970]  It's a great show.
[01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:36.850]  Really informative.
[01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:37.289]  A ton of news.
[01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.670]  A ton of clips.
[01:55:37.789 --> 01:55:38.270]  Fast-moving.
[01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:40.050]  Callers, guests, the studio, everything.
[01:55:40.909 --> 01:55:41.850]  And separately...
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.819]  We're 16 days so they can shut this puppy down.
[01:55:45.739 --> 01:55:46.300]  Energize me.
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:47.600]  Have we not fought for you?
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.199]  My goodness.

[01:55:51.079 --> 01:55:52.300]  So, defend your freedom.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.859]  I think you should bet on us in the fight.

[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:34.970]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, and I, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, Jsexers, you name it.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:38.180]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[01:56:38.399 --> 01:56:42.140]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:52.960]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[01:58:21.689 --> 01:58:22.930]  It just goes on from there.
[01:58:23.489 --> 01:58:30.029]  So, thealexshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of thealexshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:58:30.449 --> 01:58:32.369]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:58:32.569 --> 01:58:34.250]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:38.970]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:58:39.170 --> 01:58:40.409]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:48.430]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:58:48.609 --> 01:58:57.729]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:58:57.909 --> 01:59:04.989]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[01:59:05.130 --> 01:59:07.130]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:59:07.649 --> 01:59:10.090]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:11.329]  We've already...
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:13.279]  Just devastated them.
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:16.439]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:59:16.659 --> 01:59:18.000]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:59:18.479 --> 01:59:19.600]  They're super dangerous.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:22.300]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:59:22.699 --> 01:59:29.859]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these...
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:32.960]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:34.760]  So, again, I don't give up.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.619]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.279]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:59:41.439 --> 01:59:43.739]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.220]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:53.920]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:58.899]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[02:00:00.289 --> 02:00:02.289]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:04.770]  I mean, it's just...
[02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:06.130]  This is a joke.
[02:00:06.409 --> 02:00:07.590]  This is ridiculous.
[02:00:08.069 --> 02:00:09.149]  We're changing the world.
[02:00:09.289 --> 02:00:12.149]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
