[00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:32.885]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:37.149]  It is Tuesday, September 10th, 2024.
[00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.193]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:44.556]  We have 55 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 33 seconds.
[00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.017]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:49.960]  We've got the 76 days of hell when President Trump was president-elect.
[00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.885]  The deep state has promised to create, quote, civil war conditions in America.
[00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:16.699]  Alright, I intend to cover all the news and put the phones up throughout the next four hours and of course give you my analysis and pregame on tonight's debate between the teleprompter reading moron, hyena, the cackling witch, from the District of Mordor, Kamala Harris, and Trump.
[00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:20.840]  We've got so much insane news to cover today, it's massive.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.468]  But first, even CNN more and more is admitting that Kamala Harris is a total communist.
[00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:30.933]  And the list of things they list that she's doing that are so leftist is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.638]  I want to list more of these today, but here's part of that important report.
[00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.940]  First time on her campaign website.
[00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:42.244]  A K-File investigation has uncovered, meantime, a 2019 questionnaire.
[00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:48.768]  And in this questionnaire, Harris laid out some much more liberal stances, among them on immigration.
[00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:53.571]  So in 2019, in what K-File found, she said she would cut funding to ICE.
[00:01:54.051 --> 00:02:01.654]  Writing, quote, our immigrant detention system is out of control and I believe we must end the unfair incarceration of thousands of individuals, families and children.
[00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:08.797]  I was one of the first senators after President Trump was elected to advocate for a decrease in funding to ICE.
[00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:13.438]  Well, now, of course, she's touting the Biden administration's executive order to crack down on the border.
[00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.559]  K-Files Andrew Kaczynski joins me now.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.301]  Andrew, that's pretty incredible on its own when you're talking about what you found here on ICE.
[00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.482]  What else did you find?
[00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.799]  Yeah, and this was a questionnaire that she filled out for the ACLU, and this questionnaire is really an interesting snapshot in time of that 2019 Democratic primary.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.543]  Kamala Harris was trying to get to the left of Bernie Sanders.
[00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:42.811]  She was trying to get to the left of Elizabeth Warren, and you really see that in a lot of these answers, and I want to walk our viewers through a little bit of what she said.
[00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.374]  Let's just take immigration and look at what she said here.
[00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:50.737]  She said on immigration, she made this open-ended pledge to end immigrant detention.
[00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:56.121]  She said she supported taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained migrants.
[00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:59.843]  She also said she supported... Taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained migrants.
[00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:00.424]  For detained migrants.
[00:03:00.444 --> 00:03:01.885]  She actually said she supported that.
[00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:06.568]  She wrote, both wrote and answered in the affirmative when she was asked this.
[00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:09.892]  And she said she also supported it for federal prisoners.
[00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:23.170]  Now, she also pledged to slash immigration detention by 50 percent, close all family and private facilities, and decrease funding for ICE, and then end ICE detainers with local law enforcement.
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:34.510]  I mean, these are things that, you know, it would be hard to think that you would come up with taxpayer funding, gender transitions for detained migrants, and yet this, as you say, written and verbally.
[00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:38.517]  You know, what else, you know, did you find?
[00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:41.579]  Well, let's take a look at her answer here on drugs.
[00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:57.287]  She got asked about, you know, the question from the ACLU was, since drug use is better addressed as a public health issue through treatment and other programming, will you support the decriminalization at the federal level of all drug possession for personal use?
[00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:59.348]  And Harris answers, yes.
[00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:00.449]  Now, what would that mean?
[00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.753]  Well, it would mean the federal, all drug possession, that's not just marijuana, which she alluded to in her answer to this question, but it also would mean
[00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:10.194]  You know, it's federal level, all drug possession.
[00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:11.614]  You know, cocaine, things like that.
[00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:11.874]  Yeah.
[00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:14.915]  Have they responded to you on her changes on these issues?
[00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:23.297]  So we did put this question to the Harris campaign about the entire ACLU questionnaire, and the Harris campaign didn't answer any questions from CNN.
[00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:32.900]  Instead, they just provided a statement from an unnamed Harris campaign advisor that just said, the vice president's positions have been shaped by three years
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.520]  I don't know.
[00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:03.936]  It's pretty incredible stuff, and thank you very much, Andrew Kayfile, for this reporting.
[00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:06.538]  The main broadcast starts at T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:06.978]  Stay with us.
[00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:10.521]  Well, the day we've been all waiting for.
[00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:14.704]  The day of doom is here.
[00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:23.832]  Kamala Harris, who couldn't win a debate with third graders, is obviously an intense, drunken drug addict.
[00:05:25.253 --> 00:05:29.217]  Bombed out of her brain on stimulants and depressants, depending on what time of day you catch her.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.282]  Is set to take on Trump.
[00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:37.584]  Tonight, 8 p.m.
[00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:38.705]  Central, 9 p.m.
[00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:40.347]  Eastern, 7 p.m.
[00:05:40.387 --> 00:05:42.329]  Mountain, 6 p.m.
[00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:42.849]  Pacific.
[00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:45.572]  And we're going live.
[00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:47.073]  We've been live since 8 a.m.
[00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:50.937]  this morning with Harrison Smith and the crew, with American Journal.
[00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:57.296]  And myself now, the Alex Jones Show, 11.07 Central Time for the next four hours.
[00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:04.421]  Owen Schroer, 3 to 6 p.m., and then I'm back on air at 6 p.m.
[00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:18.371]  with Owen and Chase and Harrison, and we've also got Roger Stone coming up, Benny Johnson coming up, a bunch of other really smart folks popping in.
[00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:22.114]  We will be streaming at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.581]  We'll be streaming in the live show feed area at Bandot Video the entire debate.
[00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:38.607]  Pre-debate, during the debate, post-debate, and of course you'll be able to find feeds free to air at RealAlexJones on the MightyX platform.
[00:06:40.688 --> 00:06:45.150]  Now the number one social media site in the world from number three when Musk took it over a few years ago.
[00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.831]  Very exciting.
[00:06:47.076 --> 00:06:50.038]  So we expect millions and millions and millions of people to be tuned in tonight.
[00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:57.744]  So I would suggest all of you, it's a political action point, to take the live show feed that we'll put out at 6 p.m.
[00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.725]  This is a live show feed right now.
[00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:00.926]  This feed will turn into that.
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:04.108]  We're gonna take over all the feeds.
[00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:08.211]  The refeed of American Journal, the refeed of War Room, the refeed of my show today.
[00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:10.833]  All feeds.
[00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:12.715]  So the feeds that are already out and going.
[00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.652]  We'll go to the live debate coverage.
[00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:21.357]  We'll launch a new feed as well, just so it's clean and nice at 6 p.m.
[00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:37.294]  Watch the Trump-Harris debate here at Real Alex Jones and at infowars.com forward slash show for live analysis and full debate stream.
[00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:41.135]  And I'll put out those posts after the show.
[00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:42.096]  We're putting them out now.
[00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:45.238]  But if you simply say, hey, watch the debate here.
[00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.240]  Watch the debate with Alex Jones and crew.
[00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.443]  We'll have limited comments during it, but there'll be some.
[00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:55.847]  If you want to feed obviously that doesn't have that, tune in to ABC News.
[00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:00.572]  But we're going to have kind of the mystery science theater style of things.
[00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:05.491]  And again, I've watched the DNC, did four nights of coverage with the crew.
[00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.831]  I said, it's going to be horrible.
[00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:07.832]  I don't expect you to watch.
[00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:09.132]  Still a lot of folks watched, millions.
[00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:11.674]  This is edge of the seat stuff.
[00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:14.515]  So I don't get up there and say, you need to watch this.
[00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:16.676]  And then I'm just hyping that.
[00:08:16.716 --> 00:08:19.658]  When I don't think it's going to be good, I'm like, I don't expect you to watch this.
[00:08:20.738 --> 00:08:22.479]  The rest of people are like, this is going to be incredible.
[00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.379]  The DNC, let's watch it.
[00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:24.120]  I'm like, are you kidding?
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.262]  Like watching a dead animal rot in the ditch for a month.
[00:08:29.232 --> 00:08:34.675]  Worse than watching paint dry, but we had to watch it to get the clips of their lies and then juxtapose it with the truth.
[00:08:34.715 --> 00:08:37.296]  And so we just give you a battle report.
[00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:41.998]  More than 20 million people watched our clips, those four days of coverage.
[00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:43.239]  So that was the reason we did it.
[00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:45.400]  Somebody's got to watch the Democrats.
[00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:47.921]  We watch them so you don't have to.
[00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:56.506]  But you already see the effects of what they and their globalist cohorts, comrades do around the world and it's wrecked society.
[00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:07.123]  Because they have the central control over the banks and over the currency, so when they wreck things, they drive you into bankruptcy and total control, and then drive you into poverty.
[00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:12.967]  Now they can dictate the terms of your surrender, where you'll own nothing and be happy, according to Klaus Schwab.
[00:09:14.027 --> 00:09:26.075]  And there's a lot of articles out today that right-wing accelerists, accelerationists, are gonna knock the power grid out and have a cyber attack with the Russians to take out
[00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:28.670]  The election in 55 days.
[00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:31.751]  Now there's no real evidence of that.
[00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:34.133]  There is evidence of Klaus Schwab, the globalist, hyping it.
[00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:40.015]  And who's really cutting off the resources and the infrastructure of the West?
[00:09:40.075 --> 00:09:46.058]  Who's blowing up the pipelines and turning off the pipelines and funding Extinction Rebellion to sabotage everything?
[00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:53.482]  Who's got all the fake environmental laws in to shut down the West but build up China and India and Mexico and a bunch of other developing countries?
[00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:55.423]  And it's the Soros crowd.
[00:09:57.489 --> 00:10:00.332]  China builds new coal power plants with no scrubbers every week.
[00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:02.013]  We shut them down every week.
[00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:04.775]  We can't compete energy-wise.
[00:10:04.835 --> 00:10:06.197]  We shut down, as Trump has said.
[00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:14.524]  So, 55 days out, Katie barred the door because the globalists all over the world are cornered.
[00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:21.290]  Populists and nationalists, when they're on the ballot, are winning elections.
[00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:23.688]  Everywhere.
[00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:49.151]  The problem is with parliamentary systems, you have dozens, sometimes 20 or more, but usually it's 10 or so big ones, three or four dominant ones, but then you've got dozens of little parties, and they will all get one or two points, three or four points on their special interest, and then they will combine their votes, whether it's a so-called establishment right-wing group or left-wing group, usually left-wing,
[00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:52.284]  And they will then outvote the majority.
[00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.305]  That's why Benjamin Netanyahu got 20% in the last election.
[00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:57.166]  Trudeau got 20%.
[00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:05.889]  Keir Starmer, the British PM, got 18%.
[00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.491]  The current leader in Australia got 25%.
[00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:12.912]  It's the same thing.
[00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:16.694]  You look at Macron, got what, 16%?
[00:11:18.354 --> 00:11:19.515]  How is he still the president?
[00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:21.137]  Well, it's a parliament.
[00:11:22.918 --> 00:11:25.040]  So you can run down two-party systems all day.
[00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:31.025]  With two-party systems, people, when they're both corrupt and bought, a large portion just gives up and stops voting.
[00:11:31.946 --> 00:11:39.733]  But we have a beachhead of populism with Trump that's an outgrowth of the Tea Party and back to Barry Goldwater and then Ronald Reagan and the rest of it.
[00:11:40.754 --> 00:11:45.458]  And so that's why the system and the establishment Republicans are with the Democrats against him.
[00:11:45.478 --> 00:11:47.359]  That's when you know Trump's who you should vote for.
[00:11:48.183 --> 00:12:04.875]  When the neocons, and the warmongers, and the corporations, and the corrupt military leaders, and Hollywood, and the big banks are giving 95% of their money to Kamala, and then they have the DNC a few weeks ago, and it's all about how they're anti-establishment while they're blue-collar!
[00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:11.940]  So it's out of control, whether you're in the UK, or whether you're in Germany, or whether you're in the US.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.463]  White people, 20 to 1, are being attacked.
[00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:21.829]  For every attack on a brown person, particularly a black person, it's 20 to 1.
[00:12:21.989 --> 00:12:23.810]  It's not saying all black people are bad.
[00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.651]  The majority are great.
[00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:35.940]  But the media has brainwashed young Islamic, Arabic, and African, and just in general black males that whites deserve to be attacked.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.560]  And it's happening.
[00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:39.503]  And the FBI tries to suppress the numbers.
[00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:46.088]  Upwards of 80% of all the rapes in Europe are carried out by the quote, precious little migrants.
[00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:58.241]  Who come from caveman-level countries, where if a woman's out on her own, you can see one spot of skin on her, she deserves to be raped.
[00:12:59.582 --> 00:13:02.903]  And if you rape her and she talks about it, she gets the death penalty.
[00:13:03.904 --> 00:13:04.944]  Either hung or stoned.
[00:13:05.605 --> 00:13:06.085]  That's a fact.
[00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:11.772]  And the leftists try to deny that and say, oh, that's made up by the right wing.
[00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:26.022]  I could sit here and show you without even... I've personally seen hundreds of videos of women that have been raped, being hung in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iran, other places.
[00:13:27.743 --> 00:13:30.205]  You see a woman in a full black beekeeper suit, you know, hanging.
[00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.929]  Iran does it usually with a big crane.
[00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:38.850]  They just pick you up on a crane, and they would snap your neck, and they'd strangle you, and you'd kick for about three minutes, and you're dead.
[00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.331]  They like to extend it out.
[00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:42.671]  Or they just stone you to death.
[00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:43.991]  I mean, would you like me to show you?
[00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:50.432]  If they search on Exelon, they try to cover up everywhere, I bet we could find a hundred stoning videos just recently for you.
[00:13:52.553 --> 00:13:59.874]  And it's almost always the woman disrespected, or the woman wanted to drive a car, or the woman got caught going to school, or she got talking to a U.S.
[00:13:59.934 --> 00:14:00.294]  soldier,
[00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:08.219]  And the reason I raise that is, you see all the articles saying it's not happening, just like we have U.S.
[00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:19.448]  News & World Report, The Washington Post, The New York Times, they're all saying there are no Haitians committing crime, and Haitians don't eat your house cats, dogs, or ducks at the park.
[00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:29.177]  Well, I follow the news every day, and it's well known that the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea, bordering the Atlantic Ocean,
[00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:46.696]  That had hundreds of thousands over the time of slaves brought by Spain and France to grow sugarcane to then produce rum to be sold back to the Western world.
[00:14:46.716 --> 00:14:50.299]  That's why there's black people all over Central and South America, all the Caribbean.
[00:14:50.319 --> 00:14:56.725]  It wasn't just the evil Americans, the evil British colonists that brought some slaves in, the lowest level in this hemisphere.
[00:14:57.952 --> 00:15:06.395]  No, no, no, whether you're in Brazil or wherever you are, there's a lot of black folks there because they were brought there as slaves to grow sugarcane and other things.
[00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:09.976]  Cuba to grow tobacco.
[00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:13.378]  And that was the Portuguese and the Spanish and all the rest of it.
[00:15:13.398 --> 00:15:16.659]  Of course, black slavers and Arab slavers sold it to the West.
[00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:18.880]  But the point is, oh, no, only America ever had slaves.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.480]  We're the bad guys.
[00:15:20.663 --> 00:15:42.180]  But the point is, is that if you read articles about deforestation, just type that in, deforestation and erosion in Haiti, and you can look at satellite photos, I never tell the crew this and I don't have time to pull it up, but just pull up a satellite photo of Haiti, satellite photo of Haiti versus Dominican Republic.
[00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:43.922]  Dominican Republic is to the east.
[00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:45.632]  Haiti is to the west.
[00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:50.135]  They just split the island in two, between the French and the Spanish, hundreds of years ago.
[00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:53.097]  And you look at it, and there's almost no green on Haiti.
[00:15:53.117 --> 00:15:57.440]  And it's pure green, basically, in Dominican Republic.
[00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:06.086]  Because the Haitians have a huge population, and they eat and burn and cut everything down, including green trees to burn.
[00:16:07.647 --> 00:16:08.047]  And so,
[00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:12.620]  It's a, there it is, Wikipedia, deforestation in Haiti.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:20.421]  And then all the soil, the black soil runs off, just like happened in Texas from the German and Czech and Polish immigrants here 180 years ago.
[00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:26.623]  They had goats, and goats don't just eat like a cow the green leaves of a grass.
[00:16:27.303 --> 00:16:30.964]  A goat loves to pull up the whole root and get the water that's in it.
[00:16:31.964 --> 00:16:36.625]  But then when you eat all the grass and it doesn't come back, the black soil runs off.
[00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:42.777]  There was about a half foot of black soil in Central Texas, giant oak trees, looked like the Shire out of The Hobbit.
[00:16:44.698 --> 00:16:51.883]  Seen the descriptions and paintings of it, but then by the Dust Bowl of the 1920s, it was all up into Oklahoma, it all blew away!
[00:16:54.564 --> 00:16:55.985]  And Haiti's done the same thing.
[00:16:57.246 --> 00:17:04.751]  So in Haiti, now there's a photo, in Haiti you don't find birds, or lizards, and
[00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:12.086]  Dominican Republic, that's an oasis compared to Haiti, has a big, giant 30-foot fence and soldiers with machine guns.
[00:17:12.106 --> 00:17:22.572]  You don't really hear about it on the news, but when Haitians try to sneak across it because they come across and rob and kill... Yeah, there's the... See the sets of brown on one side, green on the other?
[00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:25.274]  Haiti's there, to the west.
[00:17:27.095 --> 00:17:28.056]  Dominican Republic to the east.
[00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:30.978]  And...
[00:17:32.777 --> 00:17:35.878]  I've got a cousin who's in Army Special Operations and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.778]  And he was stationed in Haiti, doing some stuff.
[00:17:39.818 --> 00:17:43.319]  And one time, there was a nice hotel he was staying at.
[00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:46.580]  He had the Haitian terrorists that were always attacking.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.280]  Didn't really tell the tourists that.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.441]  Chasing him down the road, shooting at him.
[00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:57.802]  And then when he... He didn't tell a lot of stories, but he told me this one about Haiti.
[00:17:57.862 --> 00:18:02.083]  And when he pulled into the hotel, they had...
[00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:06.212]  They tried to rob him before he was coming to the entrance.
[00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:10.795]  The military was already in the hiding, shot up the vehicle.
[00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:17.960]  And he went over and talked to him and they just took the dead bodies away and washed the blood out and towed the truck in like 10 minutes.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.581]  And they said, don't talk about it.
[00:18:20.321 --> 00:18:21.742]  He said, of course, that was it.
[00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:30.828]  So that's how nice the Haitians are that my cousin, same name as my grandfather, I'll leave it at that.
[00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:35.834]  I gotta get him on the show sometime.
[00:18:35.854 --> 00:18:37.276]  I mean, that stuff's not even secret.
[00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:38.377]  He's been all over the world.
[00:18:38.457 --> 00:18:39.878]  Army, 35 years he's been out now.
[00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.180]  Afghanistan, Iraq, you name it.
[00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:48.086]  But none of this stuff ever killed him except a spider bit him on the head in Iraq.
[00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:52.551]  Swallowed his whole head up, almost killed him, but he was sleeping.
[00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:58.477]  But the point is, is that my personal cousin, good friends of mine,
[00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:01.576]  Almost got killed by Haitian terrorists.
[00:19:01.596 --> 00:19:02.336]  And that's what they do.
[00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:03.317]  They hate the Dominicans.
[00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:04.719]  They hate everybody.
[00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:05.560]  They hate themselves.
[00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:08.342]  And the Dominicans are brown and black.
[00:19:08.442 --> 00:19:09.964]  And if you're Dominican, they try to kill you.
[00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:13.788]  Because they hate that they have kept their land up and done it properly.
[00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.491]  So I'm not saying all Haitians are bad people.
[00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:21.395]  But I mean, if you talk about a place that's got the nastiest behavior and voodoo and
[00:19:22.543 --> 00:19:24.084]  I mean, I've talked to aid workers that have been there.
[00:19:24.104 --> 00:19:32.090]  They just say, you'll just... They'll just grab a cat or dog if they find it and just start, like, demons eating it because they're into being possessed.
[00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.712]  You know, that's what they're known for?
[00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:41.358]  And I've got all these mainstream news articles, before it was politically incorrect, admitting Haiti has a major cannibalism problem.
[00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:45.301]  And, you know, the main leader there now is an admitted cannibal.
[00:19:46.301 --> 00:19:47.102]  Barbecue Bob.
[00:19:50.144 --> 00:19:50.245]  And...
[00:19:51.243 --> 00:19:57.325]  They also get you and drug you with puffer fish poison and then bury you so you think that you're a zombie and then you're a slave.
[00:19:57.765 --> 00:19:59.886]  And they put white powder on you once you're a slave.
[00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.567]  And so it's like psychological warfare.
[00:20:02.587 --> 00:20:06.508]  So there's all these zombies and people that believe they're controlled by a voodoo master.
[00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:15.031]  And it's all a bunch of theater, but man, it's just superstition taken to the 10th degree.
[00:20:18.232 --> 00:20:19.893]  And again, I've got all the news articles right here.
[00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:21.643]  Nope.
[00:20:22.404 --> 00:20:23.205]  Haiti's wonderful.
[00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:24.886]  It's totally wonderful.
[00:20:24.906 --> 00:20:25.607]  Let's bring it here.
[00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:27.008]  And it's totally made up.
[00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:28.149]  Nobody's eating your cats.
[00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:30.891]  Well, I posted it on X. I didn't see it on my list.
[00:20:30.911 --> 00:20:45.784]  You guys go to my X account, Relox Jones, and pull up the post I put up, like, last night, where since people are saying they don't eat cats, here are Haitians speaking French in America barbecuing a house cat on the open flame in the house.
[00:20:47.196 --> 00:20:56.179]  And we got them killing the ducks, and killing the geese, and grabbing them, and you got the police reports, and you have video of the police in Springfield, Ohio, pulling up.
[00:20:56.219 --> 00:21:03.262]  There's a woman in the parking lot, thinks she's a demon, eating a just-killed cat with blood all over the place.
[00:21:04.239 --> 00:21:05.300]  I showed you that yesterday.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.141]  So guys, get me that clip we played yesterday.
[00:21:07.842 --> 00:21:10.824]  And then get me the one that's on X. Got millions of views.
[00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:14.627]  Of the woman... They're like, why are you the cat?
[00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:26.496]  I mean... Here you go, so... I mean, just please.
[00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:28.137]  By the way, that cat looks really skinny.
[00:21:28.157 --> 00:21:29.278]  That's what most cats look like.
[00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:30.619]  They're really skinny when the hair's not on them.
[00:21:32.571 --> 00:21:36.093]  So these are some Haitians having a delicious meal.
[00:21:38.014 --> 00:21:38.734]  And here's the woman.
[00:21:38.754 --> 00:21:40.755]  Yeah, back it up.
[00:21:41.056 --> 00:21:42.216]  Imagine, she's like a vampire.
[00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:43.157]  The throat's torn out.
[00:21:43.997 --> 00:21:45.138]  The woman calls the police.
[00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.039]  They show up, and she continues to gobble.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.481]  And shows her teeth.
[00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:53.102]  I mean, here, go ahead and play it.
[00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:54.223]  Play both with audio.
[00:21:54.243 --> 00:21:55.183]  Play them back-to-back here.
[00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:57.004]  What did you do?
[00:21:58.885 --> 00:21:59.826]  Why'd you kill the cat?
[00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:02.027]  Smile for me.
[00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.331]  Did you eat that cat?
[00:22:10.352 --> 00:22:10.872]  Did you eat it?
[00:22:12.433 --> 00:22:13.293]  No, why'd you kill it?
[00:22:14.734 --> 00:22:15.754]  Did you guys see all this?
[00:22:16.055 --> 00:22:18.436]  No, we pulled up and she was just laying there with it.
[00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:20.277]  Did you see her eating it?
[00:22:20.477 --> 00:22:21.257]  Eating it.
[00:22:21.277 --> 00:22:22.018]  She was eating it?
[00:22:22.058 --> 00:22:22.958]  Yeah, she was.
[00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:25.960]  Can you call the Humane Society and see if they'll come pick this cat up?
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.560]  It's deceased.
[00:22:27.517 --> 00:22:28.798]  We're good to go.
[00:22:48.946 --> 00:22:51.247]  They're speaking some weird mixed dialect.
[00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:52.287]  It's like Creole, I guess.
[00:22:53.087 --> 00:22:56.969]  And then also, would you like to see in Europe, in France, and in Italy?
[00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:59.529]  I've got endless videos of barbecuing cats.
[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.611]  One of the more famous ones is right outside the Coliseum.
[00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:07.812]  And people are walking over and the lady finds her cat.
[00:23:07.832 --> 00:23:08.692]  She says, why are you?
[00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:09.673]  And he goes, I'm eating it.
[00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:11.304]  But what's the big deal?
[00:23:11.324 --> 00:23:12.244]  It's a delicious meal.
[00:23:13.805 --> 00:23:19.949]  By the way, I have more articles about the migrants have been arrested for killing a bald eagle and eating it.
[00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.311]  And they're like, it's a bird.
[00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:27.975]  And look, to a lot of people, it's so weird.
[00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:30.296]  There's somebody's dog, delicious meal.
[00:23:32.458 --> 00:23:34.499]  Your TV viewer can see this radio listeners being spared it.
[00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:42.339]  I mean, it's well known that this stuff goes on.
[00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:45.341]  I digress.
[00:23:45.401 --> 00:23:46.742]  I forgot what I was going to say.
[00:23:46.782 --> 00:23:55.249]  Look, what we do know is after 10 years in Europe, 80 plus percent of the quote migrants never get jobs.
[00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:58.711]  Two illegal Honduran migrants are arrested after shooting down a bald eagle.
[00:23:59.752 --> 00:24:01.633]  They plan to cook and eat in Nebraska.
[00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.615]  As Sheriff reveals, the local community is in an uproar.
[00:24:04.635 --> 00:24:06.517]  I remember the point I was going to make.
[00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:08.920]  You see the articles all the time.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.880]  I've seen it in the local paper.
[00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:16.504]  Back 15, 20 years ago, whenever it was, whenever Dripping Springs was still pretty rural outside of Austin, now it's a big city.
[00:24:17.364 --> 00:24:22.527]  Yeah, there's in Rome, cooking the cat, delicious meal, and the lady's like, in Italian, why are you eating my cat?
[00:24:22.747 --> 00:24:24.308]  And she goes, it's delicious.
[00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:25.609]  I'm cooking here.
[00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.293]  So, people will, it happens all over the country, they'll drive by,
[00:24:33.911 --> 00:24:39.616]  Some rural house, but now the town's encroaching on it, and they'll see somebody out by their tree or in their garage butchering a deer.
[00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:41.958]  And they call animal cruelty and say the guy killed a deer.
[00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:45.160]  So it's normal to go catch fish and gut them and all this.
[00:24:45.781 --> 00:24:52.386]  It's just not normal to eat people's, you know, the ducks at the park, or your dog or your cat, and they just don't even know they're not supposed to do it.
[00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:56.270]  I mean, if there's an animal running around in Haiti, it ain't gonna be alive.
[00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.632]  You don't see dogs, you don't see cats.
[00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:00.053]  They eat them.
[00:25:01.377 --> 00:25:02.037]  They eat them.
[00:25:02.777 --> 00:25:03.618]  They eat people.
[00:25:04.758 --> 00:25:16.000]  I have video of North African Al-Qaeda eating people in Communist China during the Great Leap Forward Cultural Revolution.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.681]  They created giant stew pots.
[00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:19.561]  You can look this up.
[00:25:20.381 --> 00:25:23.162]  Just type in Communist Chinese cannibalism.
[00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:28.063]  Communist Chinese flesh parties.
[00:25:28.803 --> 00:25:31.005]  And there's photos of these big giant pots.
[00:25:31.025 --> 00:25:32.906]  They're like 8 feet, 10 feet tall.
[00:25:33.807 --> 00:25:36.108]  And you just throw the bodies in and cook them for days.
[00:25:36.128 --> 00:25:38.290]  And they're just ladling out heads, arms.
[00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.091]  Just delicious meal.
[00:25:40.792 --> 00:25:42.533]  And that was the communal events.
[00:25:42.973 --> 00:25:45.996]  And Mao Zedong would go in and they'd bring him a leg or whatever.
[00:25:46.016 --> 00:25:46.776]  And he would just eat it.
[00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:47.797]  He would eat it and bathe.
[00:25:48.117 --> 00:25:49.879]  He had sex with like seven women a day.
[00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:51.019]  This is in mainline history.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.100]  The Chinese admit this.
[00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:53.621]  They write about it.
[00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:54.402]  They're proud of it.
[00:25:57.105 --> 00:26:01.889]  So, in any of these ancient cultures that have had famines, cannibalism is in the culture.
[00:26:06.353 --> 00:26:12.518]  And I've always said, if I need an organ someday, I'm not going to take it from a dead Chinese person.
[00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:17.102]  And I've gone to six or seven doctors to get my Achilles that I didn't get fixed right away.
[00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:20.465]  They would have just stapled it when it tore 10 years ago, but it was only 50% torn.
[00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.867]  It tore, tore, tore, tore more until it's like 80% now.
[00:26:23.267 --> 00:26:23.707]  So I bid.
[00:26:24.724 --> 00:26:26.625]  A lot of doctors say, I won't even do that, it's too reconstructive.
[00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:29.847]  But I found one, it was in Houston, one in Dallas.
[00:26:29.867 --> 00:26:30.748]  They basically told me the same thing.
[00:26:30.768 --> 00:26:33.310]  You know, they did the scans, all that.
[00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:36.772]  They're like, yes, we've got tissue.
[00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:41.795]  We've got, and I go, it's cultured tissue from China.
[00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:43.216]  And both times I said, don't lie to me.
[00:26:44.097 --> 00:26:45.057]  It's a cadaver, isn't it?
[00:26:45.097 --> 00:26:48.700]  Well, we take some cultured tissue though and wrap it around it.
[00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:52.342]  And they said, you know, we don't recommend one from the U.S.
[00:26:52.442 --> 00:26:53.463]  They're usually old people.
[00:26:55.478 --> 00:26:58.100]  And I'm just like, what else can I do?
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.243]  They go, well, we can take, there's two tendons in your big toe.
[00:27:01.283 --> 00:27:02.264]  You don't need both of them.
[00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:08.790]  It's a small tendon, but they said they would need to take muscle out of my ass, my gluteus maximus and do that.
[00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:11.693]  And that's probably what I'm going to do soon.
[00:27:12.353 --> 00:27:17.158]  But I'm going to be in a cast for seven weeks because I'm not going to take some murdered Chinese persons.
[00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:28.585]  We certainly don't claim to be doctors, but InfoWars MD can prescribe a wide variety of supplement formulas to help you stay healthy in an ever-growing toxic world.

[00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:18.006]  All right.
[00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:27.752]  I kind of digress from the first 30 minutes of the show, but it's important to talk about the lying and deception into all the illegal aliens and the crazy way they live in their countries.
[00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:29.633]  And that's the reason you don't want to live in those countries.
[00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:32.155]  And you bring people from those countries here.
[00:28:32.535 --> 00:28:35.837]  It took generation after generation after generation in Europe
[00:28:37.077 --> 00:28:38.658]  To develop basic civilization.
[00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:44.161]  And then it took generation after generation after generation to accelerate it and get where we are here in America today.
[00:28:45.021 --> 00:28:54.145]  And then you bring people in that have lived in dirt huts their whole lives, that the grocery store is any lizard or bird they can find.
[00:28:55.626 --> 00:28:59.028]  And, I mean, again, I put the articles on screen, the crew found them.
[00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:05.427]  Destruction of wildlife and deforestation and erosion in Haiti.
[00:29:05.547 --> 00:29:07.188]  And you can see the photos, the videos.
[00:29:07.628 --> 00:29:08.489]  It's hellish.
[00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:17.215]  And then you bring these folks here and just dump them out on the road and give them $3,000 a month.
[00:29:18.636 --> 00:29:19.817]  That's just the federal money.
[00:29:19.857 --> 00:29:24.640]  And then 1,000 local, they're getting $4,000, at least.
[00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:28.163]  They kick part of it back to the Democrats, so they buy a car.
[00:29:28.203 --> 00:29:29.364]  People sell them cars illegally.
[00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.211]  And they're all wearing nice clothes and they got cell phones.
[00:29:35.111 --> 00:29:43.693]  But they live in the cars, or they live in tents, or they 10 of them get a little house next door to you, and then it's on the news.
[00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:50.976]  Yeah, we had 10 chickens in our backyard, because Springfield, Ohio's rural was only 50-something thousand people.
[00:29:51.016 --> 00:29:53.376]  Now it's 70-something thousand with the Haitians and more coming.
[00:29:56.297 --> 00:29:58.938]  And they're like, my chickens are all gone.
[00:30:00.063 --> 00:30:01.503]  My dog's gone, my cat's gone.
[00:30:02.103 --> 00:30:03.084]  Oh, what's in the front yard?
[00:30:03.144 --> 00:30:04.864]  Oh, there's a Haitian lady eating my cat.
[00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:09.445]  I mean, she didn't even take it home to cook it!
[00:30:11.085 --> 00:30:20.707]  And there's police reports where the neighbor looks out, can't find their cat, it's been gutted, it's hanging to... That was in the winter, that report.
[00:30:21.348 --> 00:30:22.828]  It's just hanging, and that's what you do here.
[00:30:23.028 --> 00:30:27.849]  My grandfather would shoot a deer, gut it, and it was really cold inside the deer camp.
[00:30:31.072 --> 00:30:31.452]  Building.
[00:30:31.972 --> 00:30:32.313]  Shack.
[00:30:33.913 --> 00:30:39.416]  Got photos of this when I was a little kid, when it would get cold enough, they'd leave them up for a day or so, or two days, hanging in the cold.
[00:30:41.176 --> 00:30:41.877]  To cure the meat.
[00:30:42.537 --> 00:30:44.198]  Well, you just look out, there's your cat hanging out on a tree.
[00:30:44.238 --> 00:30:44.578]  Same thing.
[00:30:45.938 --> 00:30:47.319]  So they don't know any better.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.641]  But they're signed up, and they're gonna be Democrat voters.
[00:30:51.561 --> 00:30:52.281]  But it gets worse.
[00:30:53.862 --> 00:31:00.545]  In Michigan, in New York, in Minnesota, I have newscasts,
[00:31:02.332 --> 00:31:06.634]  Where now suddenly they're playing call to prayer at massive decibels.
[00:31:06.654 --> 00:31:07.755]  I'm going to cover this next hour.
[00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:10.516]  Islamic call to prayer.
[00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:14.298]  And by the 90s, you notice you never hear church bells anymore.
[00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:22.262]  Because the ACLU and the left and the atheists had massive funding to sue and say, that's religious.
[00:31:22.322 --> 00:31:24.383]  We don't like knowing what time of day it is.
[00:31:24.503 --> 00:31:24.743]  Oh, it's
[00:31:27.381 --> 00:31:29.202]  One o'clock, bong.
[00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:32.044]  Two o'clock, bong, bong.
[00:31:32.104 --> 00:31:33.545]  It's three o'clock, bong, bong, bong.
[00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:36.307]  It's, you know, it's noon.
[00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:41.651]  Bong, bong, bong.
[00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:43.593]  Notice, if you're old enough, remember when you were a kid?
[00:31:44.073 --> 00:31:44.773]  Even in Dallas.
[00:31:44.874 --> 00:31:45.814]  I didn't live in the middle of Dallas.
[00:31:45.834 --> 00:31:46.535]  I lived on the edge of it.
[00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:47.575]  I mean, you'd hear bong.
[00:31:47.816 --> 00:31:52.019]  You don't hear church bells because that's a religious thing and you don't want to push your religion on people.
[00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:55.041]  But now, if you're in New York or wherever, you hear the
[00:31:56.679 --> 00:31:57.240]  20 blocks away.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.861]  I mean, they blasted as loud as possible.
[00:31:59.982 --> 00:32:01.864]  The left loves that because it's not Christianity.
[00:32:02.464 --> 00:32:02.985]  So I got that.
[00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:08.910]  But that's that's that issue.
[00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.792]  I need to get into the debate tonight.
[00:32:11.913 --> 00:32:13.974]  And then what I think is going to happen are the different things that are going to happen.
[00:32:14.735 --> 00:32:16.417]  I need to open the phones up, take your calls.
[00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:23.723]  I need to get into all these mainstream corporate headlines being paid for saying, oh, organic food causes cancer.
[00:32:24.144 --> 00:32:25.245]  Healthy food's what's bad.
[00:32:25.265 --> 00:32:26.406]  That's why everybody's getting cancer.
[00:32:26.746 --> 00:32:27.647]  Not the poison shots.
[00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:30.350]  Processed foods are good for you.
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.952]  That's the new headlines.
[00:32:31.972 --> 00:32:32.973]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:36.357]  Also, we're going to be getting into...
[00:32:38.499 --> 00:32:55.426]  A lot of election fraud news, of course, always one-sided, where the Democrats are being indicted, they're being convicted, they're being caught everywhere, all over the country, from Texas to Michigan to Ohio to Pennsylvania to Georgia, but then there's still the headlines, there's no fraud, anybody that questions an election's a scammer.
[00:32:55.806 --> 00:33:00.168]  The number one sign of a free, open election is people watching and looking for it.
[00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.588]  But if you're, oh, you're not supposed to.
[00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:06.230]  And on top of that, Republicans, with their SAFE Act,
[00:33:08.064 --> 00:33:11.767]  Save Act has run into trouble on citizenship voter ID bill.
[00:33:12.788 --> 00:33:14.509]  So the Republicans can't even get together.
[00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:17.771]  Speaker Johnson can't even get it done.
[00:33:19.253 --> 00:33:24.697]  To put it to a vote to make you have an ID to vote, and then we've got new footage.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.640]  Of election officials.
[00:33:34.384 --> 00:33:35.585]  Openly telling people.
[00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:39.808]  How to steal the election.
[00:33:41.448 --> 00:33:43.749]  And then we've got a new, that's in Dallas County, Texas.
[00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.331]  The election worker publicly, they don't even hide this stuff.
[00:33:49.151 --> 00:33:57.194]  And that ties into a new James O'Keefe video, O'Keefe Media Group, where a Google executive admits they totally skew things for the Democrats.
[00:33:58.195 --> 00:34:00.716]  Not just with how they advertise or what they push.
[00:34:01.752 --> 00:34:05.075]  When you search something or what you see, but in the money that's spent.
[00:34:05.855 --> 00:34:07.156]  And they're all so matter-of-fact.
[00:34:07.176 --> 00:34:10.219]  Kind of like last week, you got the UN like, yeah, we're total fraud.
[00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.079]  We don't do anything good.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.881]  We're total tyranny, yeah.
[00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:15.423]  And then this week, oh yeah.
[00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:20.647]  Google, we're just, you know, stealing the election the best we can.
[00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:27.993]  And then also last week, oh yeah, the head spokesperson, not the spokesperson, the head of public affairs for the most important
[00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.033]  Branch of the DOJ of the country, the Southern District of New York, saying, yeah, it's totally political.
[00:34:34.073 --> 00:34:34.914]  It's all a giant scam.
[00:34:34.934 --> 00:34:35.754]  He's totally innocent.
[00:34:37.115 --> 00:34:38.115]  It's blowing up in our face.
[00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:38.996]  It's a disaster.
[00:34:41.277 --> 00:34:42.878]  They change the charges as they go.
[00:34:42.898 --> 00:34:43.779]  Double jeopardy.
[00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:44.699]  He's totally innocent.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.000]  Politically motivated.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:49.282]  It's just all there.
[00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:51.864]  And they know it.
[00:34:52.164 --> 00:34:53.525]  That's what's crazy about it.
[00:34:55.205 --> 00:35:04.367]  Is you sit there, and you're like, wait, this trial, I'm already found guilty, and it's a movie set, and the judges are following scripts, and you say it to them, and they go, they laugh at you, like, yeah, you didn't know?
[00:35:04.387 --> 00:35:08.888]  I was naive 25, 26 years ago.
[00:35:08.908 --> 00:35:09.688]  I thought I was awake.
[00:35:10.288 --> 00:35:19.590]  And they had a smart growth sustainability conference put on by the mayor, Kirk Watson, at the new Austin Convention Center at the time.
[00:35:20.512 --> 00:35:25.099]  And I go down there, and I got a camera, and I interviewed Michael Dell and others, and footage is there somewhere.
[00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:25.680]  We ought to find it.
[00:35:26.742 --> 00:35:31.629]  And I'm watching these conferences, and there's former Dallas Cowboys and all these wealthy people there.
[00:35:32.917 --> 00:35:39.982]  And I'd walk up to him and I'd say, I just watched that conference, I'd say to like the Dallas mayor or whatever, there'd be a Dallas cowboy sitting there with him talking.
[00:35:40.002 --> 00:35:41.763]  I just remember that particular Dallas cowboy.
[00:35:42.404 --> 00:35:55.933]  I'm like, hey, you guys just admitted you're taking all this farmland west of Austin and east of Austin and south of Austin in the county, and you're giving farmers and ranchers pennies on the dollar, and that you're saying it's going to be an environmental zone.
[00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:03.734]  But you admit within 10 years you'll turn around and sell it, and the mayor has a bank, later became a state rep, and he's running it through his bank.
[00:36:03.774 --> 00:36:04.575]  This is illegal.
[00:36:06.276 --> 00:36:10.459]  You're taking the property to then, through eminent domain, to then develop it later.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.342]  And literally the Dallas Cowboy goes, get out of my way.
[00:36:13.382 --> 00:36:14.402]  Of course we are.
[00:36:14.442 --> 00:36:15.723]  They were laughing at me.
[00:36:16.264 --> 00:36:17.465]  Like, of course we are!
[00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:20.687]  They were so arrogant back then because it was only really corporate media.
[00:36:21.948 --> 00:36:23.850]  I was on Access TV and had a local radio show.
[00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.411]  I guess by then it was starting to get syndicated, but
[00:36:26.772 --> 00:36:29.457]  Back then they thought they had it all done, agenda 21, everything.
[00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:33.884]  That was like... 1998 or something.
[00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:38.012]  And I'm like, wait, so you know it's criminal?
[00:36:38.612 --> 00:36:40.653]  Because I mean, I knew the people on stage were criminal.
[00:36:41.234 --> 00:36:46.736]  They had like the Rockefeller Foundation, the Audubon Society, all those guys that, oh, you know, oh, you're going to die?
[00:36:46.776 --> 00:36:49.397]  Give us your land for an environmental zone.
[00:36:49.417 --> 00:36:51.278]  And then as soon as you're dead, they sell it.
[00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:53.699]  That's all this is, folks.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.222]  It's like the head of the World Wildlife Fund, Prince Bernhardt, had to step down in the 80s.
[00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:06.014]  Because he was caught in Kenya and a bunch of other countries where they take in hundreds, millions of acres total, but corridors of hundreds of thousands.
[00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:12.717]  He was caught in multiple African countries running secret hunts and selling the rhino horns and everything.
[00:37:13.338 --> 00:37:17.440]  And then it was the World Wildlife Fund that was actually the biggest poacher in Africa.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.861]  Like, take the Red Cross.
[00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:27.043]  You volunteer for a hurricane, you're great, you give money to it.
[00:37:27.884 --> 00:37:29.185]  It's a great organization, you can get down low.
[00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:40.617]  But the original intelligence agencies, going back to the Hospitallers and the Crusades, that's where the term Hospitall comes from, is a crusading group of knights that also did medical care, the Hospitallers.
[00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:44.421]  And this is in the mainline history books.
[00:37:47.369 --> 00:37:54.851]  That that's where the Red Cross comes from is the Hospitallers and also the Knights Templars were closely associated with it.
[00:37:55.612 --> 00:38:04.414]  And today, the Red Crescent with the Muslims and the Hospitallers and the Red Cross is the oldest continually operating intelligence agency in the world.
[00:38:04.755 --> 00:38:13.037]  And that's, I mean, you'll hear about how missionaries and doctors on foreign missions are usually intelligence agency.
[00:38:13.077 --> 00:38:15.118]  I mean, half of them probably are on average.
[00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:21.986]  I mean, that's because they're there, they're trusted, they're watching, they're getting intel, they can do other missions, kill people, whatever you need them done.
[00:38:23.327 --> 00:38:25.749]  That's the government favorite type of assassin is actually a physician.
[00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:32.535]  Large cores of physician assassins are already in place in hospitals and things can kill you when they need to, they get the order.
[00:38:39.096 --> 00:38:53.888]  It was the Red Cross from the police and firefighters I talked to on 9-11 that they heard the countdown to blow up Building 7 and the Feds were using, the Feds that were in on it, not the rest of the Feds, were using the Red Cross channels to run the demolition of all three towers.
[00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:59.952]  And the cops that were actually getting on that channel were hearing him talking code and stuff and then heard the countdown and saw Building 7 blow up.
[00:39:00.433 --> 00:39:04.076]  I've got PBS, when the countdown happened, hey, we're getting a countdown, get back here, blow it up, get back.
[00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:09.180]  And we later found the cops on there, they're saying that, had them on the show, they're like, yeah, we heard the countdown, it was the Red Cross.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.924]  So you'd never think of the Red Cross blowing up Building 7, or at least being in control of it.
[00:39:15.005 --> 00:39:17.327]  You're like, oh, that's the Red Cross, nice guys over there.
[00:39:18.848 --> 00:39:20.769]  It's like the heart of the Crusaders.
[00:39:21.812 --> 00:39:26.155]  It's a military operation, but it's like, oh, we're here to help you, hospital.
[00:39:26.415 --> 00:39:27.416]  We're your doctors.
[00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:37.523]  So see, that's why they use women now to be all the corporate chiefs that take your rights and sell body parts.
[00:39:37.543 --> 00:39:39.144]  And we're just taking the babies alive.
[00:39:39.184 --> 00:39:39.685]  I'm a woman.
[00:39:39.745 --> 00:39:40.425]  It's non-threatening.
[00:39:41.046 --> 00:39:41.986]  Oh, it's a hospital.
[00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:42.967]  Oh, it's a woman.
[00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.028]  Oh, it's non-threatening.
[00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:49.546]  Cause if you're wearing a black uniform with a skull on the cap like a Nazi, you're like, Oh, that's the bad guy.
[00:39:49.566 --> 00:39:52.668]  And they were like, Hey, on guard, we're openly going to come after you.
[00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.049]  So we're wearing black.
[00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.750]  We're wearing skulls.
[00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:55.310]  We're going to kill you.
[00:39:55.851 --> 00:40:00.675]  They decided to kind of be out in the open with it, but that's not the way it all works, folks.
[00:40:01.616 --> 00:40:02.356]  So we've got that.
[00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:04.878]  That we're going to be getting into.
[00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:08.701]  And I just want to open the phones up at the start of the next hour on the debate tonight.
[00:40:09.382 --> 00:40:10.283]  What are you expecting?
[00:40:10.363 --> 00:40:11.644]  What tricks do you think she'll use?
[00:40:11.684 --> 00:40:12.705]  I've got a bunch of examples.
[00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:14.066]  I'm going to go over my predictions.
[00:40:16.687 --> 00:40:18.928]  And I'll go ahead and kind of state those now.
[00:40:19.168 --> 00:40:20.669]  No, I've got a lot of notes here.
[00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:25.430]  I'll do that when we start the next hour, then I'll go to your calls.
[00:40:26.191 --> 00:40:28.512]  But in the meantime, the first thing I want to get to now is this.
[00:40:30.272 --> 00:40:31.913]  This is such a great thing that's happened.
[00:40:33.942 --> 00:40:41.808]  I've talked a lot about this, that Trump needs to come out and not just say they stood down, but that they clearly were helping crooks.
[00:40:42.328 --> 00:40:43.589]  He was being protected.
[00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.371]  They pulled the security off.
[00:40:45.411 --> 00:40:48.333]  They didn't allow communication with local police and the Secret Service.
[00:40:48.793 --> 00:40:53.637]  CNN covered that speech and hadn't done it in a year before.
[00:40:54.958 --> 00:40:57.620]  They were intending to have the head shot and blow Trump's head off that day.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.761]  And at first, they didn't even say he'd been shot.
[00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:03.044]  They said, oh, he just fell down for about eight hours.
[00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:06.873]  And we've already gone over that, but you know the background, you know what went on.
[00:41:06.893 --> 00:41:10.736]  96 minutes walking around, rangefinder, bag, bike.
[00:41:11.457 --> 00:41:12.518]  The police saying, stop him.
[00:41:13.318 --> 00:41:13.859]  Interview him.
[00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:14.980]  No, we're not going to.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.120]  He's on the roof.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.661]  Hey, he's on the roof.
[00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:17.101]  Stop him.
[00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:17.922]  26 minutes.
[00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.184]  On the roof with a gun for six, seven minutes.
[00:41:20.704 --> 00:41:22.005]  People running by the hundreds pointing.
[00:41:22.465 --> 00:41:24.327]  Secret Service didn't lie and say they shot him.
[00:41:24.707 --> 00:41:26.008]  It was the local police shot him.
[00:41:26.248 --> 00:41:30.291]  That's all been confirmed, but back of the news and congressional testimony, things like that.
[00:41:30.391 --> 00:41:31.993]  So they stood down.
[00:41:32.473 --> 00:41:33.574]  They tried to get Trump killed.
[00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:39.053]  I was saying all the Secret Service were in on it, but definitely the ones that stood down.
[00:41:40.094 --> 00:41:42.276]  I mean, we need to be in front of Congress, the sniper.
[00:41:42.556 --> 00:41:45.098]  Okay, we heard you shot Crooks, but now we learned it's the police.
[00:41:46.139 --> 00:41:46.940]  Who was on the radio?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.346]  Who was on your cell phone telling you not to take the shot when he's up there for six minutes with a gun, climbing around and then pointing at Trump?
[00:41:55.948 --> 00:41:58.591]  And Trump said, if I'd have been told there was a security risk, I wouldn't have gone out then.
[00:42:00.236 --> 00:42:05.499]  So now Melania has come out and said that basically it was an assassination attempt and that she calls for the truth.
[00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:06.259]  Yes!
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.101]  Let's also get her saying the Lord's Prayer.
[00:42:10.121 --> 00:42:11.702]  I was going to play that last week, but I never got to it.
[00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:12.742]  The full version.
[00:42:14.223 --> 00:42:15.884]  So she understands they're trying to kill her husband.
[00:42:18.151 --> 00:42:21.113]  The media tries to spin it like she's not supportive, that she isn't on the campaign trail.
[00:42:21.433 --> 00:42:23.435]  She's never been a big part of the campaign trail.
[00:42:23.655 --> 00:42:24.576]  She takes care of the family.
[00:42:24.896 --> 00:42:26.177]  She takes care of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:42:26.217 --> 00:42:27.518]  She takes care of the businesses.
[00:42:27.938 --> 00:42:29.339]  She is Trump's main confidant.
[00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:30.680]  They are like peas in a pod.
[00:42:31.881 --> 00:42:35.303]  And she's totally loyal.
[00:42:35.483 --> 00:42:42.568]  But when it's key to support her husband at inaugurations or things like that, or the RNC, things like that, she's supportive.
[00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:44.950]  But here she is when it counts.
[00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:47.109]  Boom!
[00:42:47.929 --> 00:42:51.071]  Why didn't law enforcement arrest the shooter before the speech?
[00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:56.833]  Melania Trump releases powerful video on the attempted assassination of her husband.
[00:42:57.273 --> 00:42:57.733]  Here it is.
[00:42:59.273 --> 00:43:05.176]  The attempt to end my husband's life was a horrible, distressing experience.
[00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:09.197]  Now, the silence around it feels heavy.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:17.490]  I can't help but wonder, why didn't law enforcement officials arrest the shooter before the speech?
[00:43:19.093 --> 00:43:23.600]  There is definitely more to this story, and we need to uncover the truth.
[00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:46.734]  Yeah, Trump needs to come right out and say they got 325,000 admitted children, upwards of a million is estimated that are missing, many in sex slavery, masses in slave labor, and Kamala did it.
[00:43:46.854 --> 00:43:47.934]  She was the border czar.
[00:43:48.314 --> 00:43:54.957]  When she tries to moralize and say he's bad, she's gonna hit him with, you keep women from having abortions when they've been raped.
[00:43:56.457 --> 00:43:58.058]  She's gonna hit him with a bunch of other crap.
[00:43:58.598 --> 00:43:59.138]  One-liners.
[00:43:59.218 --> 00:44:01.839]  The media will declare her the winner even if she didn't show up.
[00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:04.961]  Yeah, Pelosi's saying Trump won't show up, which is total crap.
[00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:07.783]  Everything they're worried about with her, they say Trump's doing.
[00:44:07.983 --> 00:44:18.911]  I'll get into it more next hour, but Trump absolutely needs to get hardcore, he's already doing it, and explain the deep state's criminal, he's gonna prosecute him, because they have to be prosecuted.
[00:44:18.931 --> 00:44:20.492]  It's not vengeance, it's not violence.
[00:44:21.113 --> 00:44:22.374]  They've done it, they started it.
[00:44:24.135 --> 00:44:28.078]  And so, they're like, oh my god, everyone's scared, he's gonna arrest them.
[00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.019]  Well, have you committed a crime?
[00:44:29.059 --> 00:44:29.259]  Yeah.
[00:44:30.623 --> 00:44:35.548]  We can't leave the deep state in there and then put Trump in there and then they all attack him and continue to attack us.
[00:44:35.908 --> 00:44:37.109]  Look at everybody they've put in jail.
[00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.231]  Look at how they tried to outlaw a questioning election.
[00:44:39.532 --> 00:44:40.653]  Look at all the human trafficking.
[00:44:41.894 --> 00:44:43.195]  He's got to hit the human trafficking.
[00:44:43.656 --> 00:44:46.959]  He's got to promise to end this potential for World War III in Ukraine.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.824]  He's got to push a peace deal in the Middle East, which he says he'll do, which was already successful.
[00:44:53.442 --> 00:44:55.544]  He's got to expose the human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:44:55.804 --> 00:44:59.127]  He's got to come out about them trying to assassinate him more and keep that in the news.
[00:44:59.187 --> 00:45:02.150]  People remember that because that gave him a super surge.
[00:45:03.131 --> 00:45:07.335]  But Trump, you know, thinks it's tough to not bring up stuff and just kind of bull through it.
[00:45:07.355 --> 00:45:09.036]  He talked about it a little bit, said he believed in God.
[00:45:09.337 --> 00:45:10.478]  He thanks God for saving him.
[00:45:11.238 --> 00:45:13.921]  And he did it for a couple of weeks, but now he barely talks about it.
[00:45:17.498 --> 00:45:17.978]  We're good to go.
[00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:40.370]  And JFK and Martin Luther King.
[00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.871]  And make it all about that, which he's done some.
[00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:48.953]  And he's come out and said he'll sign an executive order and ban government censorship and collusion and fire people that do it.
[00:45:49.014 --> 00:45:49.394]  Great!
[00:45:50.654 --> 00:45:55.016]  But keep hammering it and hammering it and keep bringing it up.
[00:45:55.536 --> 00:45:57.017]  Don't just talk about it once or twice.
[00:45:58.758 --> 00:46:00.559]  Hammer the open border human trafficking.
[00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:02.059]  When you talk about the border, the human trafficking.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.340]  And the crime wave.
[00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:07.442]  Keep hammering.
[00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:11.412]  Talk about the attempted assassination, stand down and have the cover up.
[00:46:11.932 --> 00:46:14.874]  And they've clammed up and lied about everything that they did say.
[00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:19.797]  Everything the Secret Service Deputy Director and Director said was lies.
[00:46:20.017 --> 00:46:21.458]  And he was the one that turns out ran the thing.
[00:46:22.019 --> 00:46:22.719]  Ronald Rowe.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.362]  Ronald Rowe needs to be investigated.
[00:46:29.103 --> 00:46:31.305]  And yeah, let the bureaucracy know, we're done with you.
[00:46:31.645 --> 00:46:35.948]  You've already hurt us, you've come after us, you've killed hundreds of thousands of us with fentanyl and your poison shots.
[00:46:37.056 --> 00:46:50.799]  It was Biden who tried to make the shots forced, tried to keep the lockdowns going, Trump tried to end them, and he's far from perfect, but he's... Biden's 100% guilty, and Trump's 10% guilty, and I know Trump, and I know what he was thinking, I know they lied to him, and so I'll hold my nose on that.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.420]  Because the alternative is total destruction.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:02.782]  There will never be another free or fair election in our lifetimes, without violent revolution, which I don't want, either able to steal this election.
[00:47:03.142 --> 00:47:05.243]  They're gonna sew up the fraud like Venezuela.
[00:47:07.403 --> 00:47:08.365]  And so many other tyrannies.
[00:47:09.328 --> 00:47:11.453]  And all the mainline analysts agree with that, and so does Trump.
[00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:12.997]  So...
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.161]  That's all coming up.
[00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:18.163]  But great job to Melania, just saying it like it is.
[00:47:18.844 --> 00:47:19.785]  Deliberate stand down.
[00:47:20.385 --> 00:47:21.386]  Tried to kill my husband.
[00:47:21.766 --> 00:47:22.367]  We know you did it.
[00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:23.748]  She needs to go all the way.
[00:47:24.089 --> 00:47:27.612]  Because everybody I talk to, even liberals, they go, of course they tried to kill him.
[00:47:28.032 --> 00:47:29.213]  You've seen the liberals all over the news.
[00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:30.434]  Like, pull up some of those people.
[00:47:30.894 --> 00:47:32.015]  Bunch of women, bunch of men.
[00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.398]  Yeah, I'm pissed off they didn't get him.
[00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.238]  But more will come.
[00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.860]  I can't wait till he's dead.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.341]  I'd give somebody money to kill Trump.
[00:47:38.361 --> 00:47:39.142]  Remember those quotes?
[00:47:41.926 --> 00:47:49.192]  And all their TV shows and movies and Snoop Dogg and Let's Kill Trump and all the people on national news saying, you know, somebody's going to kill this guy.
[00:47:49.532 --> 00:47:50.833]  Deep State's going to kill this guy.
[00:47:51.153 --> 00:47:56.317]  Former CIA deputy head that actually ran foreign assassinations is on CNN saying we're going to kill this guy.
[00:47:57.178 --> 00:47:59.980]  The intelligence agencies have six ways to send these to get at you.
[00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:00.921]  Chuckie Schumer.
[00:48:01.782 --> 00:48:02.903]  They feel insulated.
[00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:03.903]  They feel invincible.
[00:48:04.144 --> 00:48:05.084]  That's why we have tyranny.
[00:48:05.324 --> 00:48:07.066]  They're arrogant, but not so much anymore.
[00:48:07.446 --> 00:48:07.806]  That's good.
[00:48:08.735 --> 00:48:11.156]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:48:11.496 --> 00:48:13.376]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:48:14.936 --> 00:48:22.398]  Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, America's third president, can't read his quotes enough.
[00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:23.078]  What a genius.
[00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:28.079]  Alright, I'm gonna open the phones up early next hour.
[00:48:28.119 --> 00:48:29.660]  I'll give out the number at that time.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.040]  We'll go ahead and fire the phone system up now.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:31.860]  I'll give the number out in a moment.
[00:48:33.481 --> 00:48:34.321]  And I'm gonna do it again.
[00:48:35.794 --> 00:48:36.734]  I'm taking a lot of calls today.
[00:48:36.774 --> 00:48:40.916]  So in the first hour of calls, the second hour, it is first-time callers.
[00:48:40.956 --> 00:48:45.858]  But then after we load the phones up, that'll just take a few minutes.
[00:48:46.758 --> 00:48:49.259]  Then when you hear a caller hang up, anybody can call.
[00:48:49.539 --> 00:48:52.060]  But I want to give first-timers again a chance to show so big.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.741]  They've tried and tried and tried, never gone on.
[00:48:54.201 --> 00:48:55.841]  First-time callers coming up.
[00:48:57.282 --> 00:48:58.762]  I'll get the number out right when we start the next hour.
[00:48:58.782 --> 00:49:00.203]  All right, I'm going to break.
[00:49:01.798 --> 00:49:04.259]  I'm gonna be very, very clear with everybody, because I've been clear about this.
[00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:07.160]  We have game-changing, incredible products.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.382]  Whether it's water filtration, air filtration, the very best, lowest prices, so important.
[00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:12.903]  All the stuff going on in society.
[00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:14.743]  We have the best storable foods, lowest prices.
[00:49:14.783 --> 00:49:17.384]  We have great t-shirts, limited supply, limited edition.
[00:49:17.865 --> 00:49:18.205]  We have...
[00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:24.251]  Great books, great films, but really amazing supplements at infowarestore.com.
[00:49:24.771 --> 00:49:26.113]  And that's how we fund this operation.
[00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:31.939]  Everybody going into the winter, particularly the fall and winter, needs to be on BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:38.366]  You need to be on our 1000mg Organic Vitamin C with Rosehips and Zinc that is the dominator for your immune system and overall health.
[00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:40.514]  It's amazing.
[00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:41.556]  And that's discounted 40%.
[00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:43.018]  And that's gotta end soon.
[00:49:43.058 --> 00:49:44.881]  The sale's gotta end soon, because we're close to selling out.
[00:49:46.063 --> 00:49:48.928]  Of the vitamin C, we're also very, very close.
[00:49:50.385 --> 00:49:51.466]  Selling a lot of the products.
[00:49:51.686 --> 00:49:53.326]  Nitric Boost is 40% off.
[00:49:53.426 --> 00:49:54.607]  That sale's going to end soon.
[00:49:54.707 --> 00:50:05.752]  It's got all these known natural compounds that increase nitric oxide in the blood that opens up and cleans out your blood and arteries and veins and capillaries and takes the toxins out.
[00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:10.854]  It has a lot of other great effects as well for your libido and stamina and energy.
[00:50:11.034 --> 00:50:12.574]  Nitric Boost from InfoWarsMD.
[00:50:12.895 --> 00:50:16.956]  The full spectrum CBD gummies and full spectrum 1000 milligram tincture.
[00:50:17.536 --> 00:50:18.117]  We sell it for
[00:50:19.197 --> 00:50:23.239]  $40 less than the exact same people we buy it from that are a top company.
[00:50:23.499 --> 00:50:29.942]  People are paying $120 all day for a 1,000 milligram bottle of tincture, and it costs them like $20, $30 to produce.
[00:50:30.422 --> 00:50:31.663]  But there's a huge markup.
[00:50:31.703 --> 00:50:32.263]  We don't do it.
[00:50:32.583 --> 00:50:37.945]  At $60-something bucks, you cannot beat the deal on our liquid tincture CBD full spectrum.
[00:50:38.326 --> 00:50:40.506]  It's private-labeled from the top groups in the country.
[00:50:40.967 --> 00:50:42.247]  LaVita RX is amazing.
[00:50:42.367 --> 00:50:43.648]  Superfood Greens is amazing.
[00:50:44.705 --> 00:50:49.846]  We have Turmeric 95 because sometimes body sells out, but InfoWars MD, we have a great supplier, it doesn't most of the time.
[00:50:50.466 --> 00:50:55.287]  It's got the same 95% curcuminoid, a little bit different other ingredients, so it's apples and oranges.
[00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:00.149]  But the turmeric is the same thing.
[00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:04.470]  InfoWars MD line at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.050]  And then, my dad's company.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:18.002]  DrJonesNitriles.com and I know 60% of the great products are sold out and people are frustrated.
[00:51:18.663 --> 00:51:27.526]  My dad's taking all the money he's got and he's reordered 10 of the products that'll be in some in about three weeks, some in about a month and a half, and some in two months.
[00:51:27.966 --> 00:51:29.907]  Like Turbo Force will be in in six weeks.
[00:51:31.501 --> 00:51:32.563]  And I know that's super popular.
[00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:34.526]  So a lot of stuff that's not available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:51:34.987 --> 00:51:36.871]  It's now available at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:37.832]  But the stuff that's there is great.
[00:51:38.333 --> 00:51:39.175]  Foundational Energy.
[00:51:39.195 --> 00:51:41.760]  Next level of Foundational Energy is about to sell out.
[00:51:42.717 --> 00:51:45.179]  It is not like any other stimulant out there because it's not a stimulant.
[00:51:45.699 --> 00:52:03.593]  It's concentrated organic methylfolate, the breakdown and the concentrate of folic acid with 100% absorption by the cells, blasts them out, cleans them out, re-energizes them, and so at the base level it just boosts all your energy and it feels like you've had three cups of coffee, four cups of coffee, but with no jitters and no weirdness and no irritability.
[00:52:03.693 --> 00:52:04.594]  It is, well...
[00:52:05.374 --> 00:52:05.654]  I don't know.
[00:52:05.694 --> 00:52:07.435]  If I take the full dose, I get a little wild.
[00:52:07.455 --> 00:52:08.415]  I mean, I'm on it right now.
[00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:09.676]  I'm Captain King Kong right now.
[00:52:09.696 --> 00:52:11.237]  People, I'm finally taking all the supplements.
[00:52:11.257 --> 00:52:16.059]  Sometimes I forget to take them for a few months, and you notice, I'm back on it all right now for about five weeks.
[00:52:16.919 --> 00:52:24.442]  So, National Fundational Energy, drjonesnaturals.com, all the nano silver products, the Cabochill, the Top Brain, the Rocket Rest, this incredible natural sleep aid.
[00:52:24.682 --> 00:52:25.803]  They're all top of the line.
[00:52:26.203 --> 00:52:26.963]  Thank you for your support.
[00:52:27.003 --> 00:52:27.884]  It's key to our operation.
[00:52:27.924 --> 00:52:29.264]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:29.584 --> 00:52:30.585]  You really need these products.
[00:52:30.685 --> 00:52:31.765]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:32.026 --> 00:52:32.886]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:52:43.666 --> 00:52:56.474]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:52:56.914 --> 00:52:59.116]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:52:59.936 --> 00:53:05.360]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:06.425 --> 00:53:14.989]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:15.329 --> 00:53:17.190]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:22.312]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in fours.
[00:53:23.032 --> 00:53:25.333]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts.
[00:53:26.314 --> 00:53:31.596]  We found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country, not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:32.416 --> 00:53:33.937]  And they said, listen, you know,
[00:53:35.154 --> 00:53:51.149]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:51.529 --> 00:53:58.216]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:53:59.286 --> 00:54:00.587]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.187 --> 00:54:19.291]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:19.371 --> 00:54:26.014]  So, case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:26.154 --> 00:54:28.655]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:30.736]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:30.936 --> 00:54:40.724]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:43.746]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:43.806 --> 00:54:44.867]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:46.528 --> 00:54:53.229]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:58.991]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:54:59.111 --> 00:55:07.632]  So I bought these Ultimate Turmeric Formulums, sold out at mfulworthstore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:07.692 --> 00:55:09.773]  So that's why Mfulworth's MD is such an amazing line.
[00:55:10.013 --> 00:55:10.113]  And
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:24.685]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:25.165 --> 00:55:29.566]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:34.268]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:35.289 --> 00:55:40.512]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:40.612 --> 00:55:41.233]  It's amazing.
[00:55:41.353 --> 00:55:42.273]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:42.353 --> 00:55:44.195]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:04.508 --> 00:56:05.008]  Thank you.
[00:56:36.897 --> 00:56:40.078]  Your calls are coming up, and I'll give you my take on the debate coming up.
[00:56:40.098 --> 00:56:42.199]  A lot of big cash tonight.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.961]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[00:56:53.762 --> 00:56:55.683]  I can feel human liberty exploding.
[00:56:56.583 --> 00:56:58.584]  I can feel your will.
[00:57:02.425 --> 00:57:04.626]  Evil is in full panic mode right now.
[00:57:06.258 --> 00:57:07.238]  God is real.
[00:57:07.978 --> 00:57:08.798]  God is great.
[00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:12.639]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[00:57:14.939 --> 00:57:17.400]  And I want all of you to hear me now.
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:25.661]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically, has just begun.
[00:57:28.282 --> 00:57:35.443]  And it is your choice, spiritually, now, which side you're going to be on that will predestine
[00:57:37.346 --> 00:57:38.827]  The entire future throughout the universe.
[00:57:39.928 --> 00:57:41.530]  Earth is only the launch point.
[00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:44.352]  The eye has not seen.
[00:57:45.533 --> 00:57:47.335]  The ear has not heard.
[00:57:47.355 --> 00:57:51.919]  The mind has not conceived what God has in store for us.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:54.341]  You can feel it.
[00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:55.842]  You can see it.
[00:57:55.882 --> 00:57:57.103]  You can touch it.
[00:57:57.143 --> 00:57:57.924]  You can taste it.
[00:57:58.484 --> 00:58:00.326]  You know it in your very bones.
[00:58:01.047 --> 00:58:02.168]  The heart of your soul.
[00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:08.394]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead, guide, and direct you.
[00:58:09.295 --> 00:58:10.675]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[00:58:11.596 --> 00:58:12.816]  Ask God to purify you.
[00:58:13.416 --> 00:58:16.658]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[00:58:17.298 --> 00:58:26.122]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little g-god of this world.
[00:58:28.764 --> 00:58:29.364]  We are living
[00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:33.567]  In such an incredibly historical time right now.
[00:58:34.588 --> 00:58:38.930]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:47.796]  But it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.
[00:59:02.201 --> 00:59:06.162]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:08.262]  All right.
[00:59:29.289 --> 00:59:30.910]  Over 300 radio stations join us.
[00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.532]  We've got a break here in a few minutes, and we'll give the number out, take your calls.
[00:59:34.592 --> 00:59:37.194]  I'll give you my take on what's coming up with tonight's debate.
[00:59:37.954 --> 00:59:45.419]  We're only seven hours and 57 minutes out from that, and I meant to have it in my stack this morning.
[00:59:45.439 --> 00:59:46.219]  I didn't give it to you guys.
[00:59:46.259 --> 00:59:46.939]  They just launched.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.841]  I was just watching it, getting a cup of coffee during the break.
[00:59:51.442 --> 00:59:57.506]  The launch of that massive rocket with the astronauts, the first private spacewalk.
[00:59:58.285 --> 01:00:04.626]  They're also going to put the module deeper in space than anybody's gone with humans since the moon missions.
[01:00:05.787 --> 01:00:08.407]  And so I definitely want to get some of the HD of that.
[01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:14.208]  Musk has been putting it out and report on that a little bit later in the broadcast as well, because that's a big deal.
[01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:20.550]  So I'm going to give the toll free number out right now and also give it out again when we come back.
[01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.550]  The lines will be full.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.671]  First time callers, fill up the phones and then anybody else calling in after that,
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.222]  You could be a longtime caller, whatever.
[01:00:30.683 --> 01:00:36.550]  If you disagree, be sure and tell me and I'll try to maybe even go around and go to you.
[01:00:38.953 --> 01:00:42.797]  By that, maybe the crudest to put disagrees up front because I sometimes don't read what the comments are.
[01:00:42.817 --> 01:00:44.138]  Just go to the calls, the order they come in.
[01:00:45.134 --> 01:00:46.596]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:00:46.616 --> 01:00:46.816]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:00:46.836 --> 01:00:49.740]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us on this live Tuesday, September 10th debate.
[01:01:01.277 --> 01:01:09.300]  And again, I'll be honest, I love being on air and I love fighting tyranny, but I'm 50 and after I've already been on air four hours covering the DNC and stuff, I just couldn't stand it.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.260]  The RNC was okay.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.060]  It was still pretty good.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.342]  So I could bear it and had some great parts, but man, I'm going to have plenty of energy tonight.
[01:01:15.502 --> 01:01:16.842]  I am fired up.
[01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:19.903]  In fact, I'm distracted by it.
[01:01:19.923 --> 01:01:21.163]  I mean, this is going to be crazy.
[01:01:21.243 --> 01:01:22.464]  I don't know how she's going to perform.
[01:01:23.223 --> 01:01:25.745]  So I'll talk about that when we join a bunch of stations in 60 seconds.
[01:01:26.466 --> 01:01:27.106]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:01:27.146 --> 01:01:31.329]  Be sure and follow us, and we'll have live streams tonight at Real Alex Jones on X and M4s.
[01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:41.818]  Well, the big Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral blasted off in the early morning hours tonight on its deep space mission and spacewalk.
[01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.479]  There's a great video.
[01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.280]  I forgot to send the crew.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.523]  It's on my X at Real Alex Jones of Musk up on the gantry up there.
[01:01:48.543 --> 01:01:50.505]  It's like thousands of feet in the air.
[01:01:52.228 --> 01:01:58.394]  As the sun sets, and you can see his excitement, this is a big deal.
[01:02:01.737 --> 01:02:09.204]  Musk has put more spacecraft into orbit and more satellites than everybody combined now in the United States in its history.
[01:02:10.045 --> 01:02:16.691]  So this is a massive industrial operation, and you can talk about the satellites and how they can surveil and stuff, that's part of it, but
[01:02:17.475 --> 01:02:18.616]  The point is, is the U.S.
[01:02:18.636 --> 01:02:22.638]  space program is back, and I believe we should be a space-faring people.
[01:02:23.399 --> 01:02:24.420]  We need to go to the stars.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:30.323]  That is part of our mission as explorers, and we're basically in our egg right now.
[01:02:30.383 --> 01:02:45.053]  The Earth is just the launch point of human civilization, and I agree to a great extent with some of the things that even Jeff Bezos has said, that the Earth down the road will end up just being like a national park everybody visits.
[01:02:46.618 --> 01:02:47.938]  That's how expansionist we'll be.
[01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:53.660]  We need hundreds of millions of people, not hundreds of millions like the globalists want.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.861]  I want to see a pro-human future.
[01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:00.562]  So here is the rocket, biggest in the world, blasting off.
[01:03:00.582 --> 01:03:11.805]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Ignition.
[01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:44.959]  Risking their lives on that big boy.
[01:03:44.999 --> 01:03:46.560]  The globalists are always talking about
[01:03:47.768 --> 01:03:48.008]  Whoa!
[01:03:48.028 --> 01:03:52.130]  And we're throttling down in preparation for Max Q. Next call out, the vehicle, supersonic.
[01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:15.692]  And they're on the left side.
[01:04:17.593 --> 01:04:25.477]  Thumbs up from the pilot on the left side there.
[01:04:29.919 --> 01:04:31.460]  We're throttled back up to power.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.582]  And we heard the call out, one Bravo.
[01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:40.865]  That just tells the crew what would happen should they need to initiate anything.
[01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:44.457]  But right now, everybody making nominal callouts.
[01:04:44.557 --> 01:04:55.249]  This is the equivalent of Christopher Columbus and those three little ships that came across the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.922]  With the Nina, the Penta, and the Santa Maria?
[01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.503]  And now look at everything we built.
[01:05:01.643 --> 01:05:06.126]  It's going to be easier to colonize space than what the ancients did colonizing the world.
[01:05:06.506 --> 01:05:07.566]  They have separation.
[01:05:07.586 --> 01:05:08.587]  Everything continues to look good.
[01:05:22.654 --> 01:05:25.456]  We'll have, in half a minute, three major activities.
[01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.298]  Shutdown of the nine Merlin 1D engines.
[01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.399]  Stage separation.
[01:05:31.299 --> 01:05:33.321]  And then ignition of the second stage engine.
[01:05:35.002 --> 01:05:36.503]  That looked like separation earlier, but it wasn't.
[01:05:36.523 --> 01:05:38.944]  Constant acceleration now for the crew just below 4 G's.
[01:05:39.184 --> 01:05:41.005]  They'll spin the engines, cut in power.
[01:05:41.586 --> 01:05:43.527]  See, we're coming up 70 kilometers.
[01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:49.891]  Preparing for MECO.
[01:05:54.525 --> 01:05:58.826]  We have separation.
[01:05:58.846 --> 01:06:13.090]  They got schizophrenics online that think this is all fake.
[01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:18.146]  The cheers behind us and the views on your screen.
[01:06:19.327 --> 01:06:24.628]  The first stage booster now on its way to attempt landing on just read the instructions.
[01:06:25.249 --> 01:06:29.770]  In 1970s, the Pentagon could shoot a cruise missile down your chimney.
[01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:31.711]  It's all real, folks.
[01:06:31.831 --> 01:06:35.892]  See everything else you see around you.
[01:06:35.932 --> 01:06:37.873]  The drones, the self-driving cars.
[01:06:38.593 --> 01:06:39.314]  We made it all.
[01:06:39.434 --> 01:06:43.275]  Excuse me, from pilot Scott Kidd-Poteet.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.604]  All right, let's stop there because I want to go to your calls.
[01:06:45.624 --> 01:06:45.804]  877-789-2539.
[01:06:45.824 --> 01:06:47.628]  First time callers.
[01:06:47.748 --> 01:06:53.018]  We're talking about the debate tonight coming up in just a little over seven hours.
[01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:56.363]  We'll be live straight on through the day.
[01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:57.503]  We started off at 8 a.m.
[01:06:57.884 --> 01:06:58.704]  with American Journal.
[01:06:59.865 --> 01:07:01.987]  And then we've got, boy, that went viral today.
[01:07:02.187 --> 01:07:02.627]  Big show.
[01:07:02.647 --> 01:07:04.368]  Just happened to notice that.
[01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:06.490]  It's always big, but it really went viral today.
[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.311]  Great job, the crew and host.
[01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:10.973]  And then Alex Jones shows right now.
[01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:11.614]  3 p.m.
[01:07:11.634 --> 01:07:12.354]  I go off the air.
[01:07:13.255 --> 01:07:13.996]  Owen takes over.
[01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.878]  It's always power-packed with info and guests and calls.
[01:07:18.019 --> 01:07:18.619]  And then at 6 p.m.,
[01:07:20.396 --> 01:07:21.257]  I'll be back here.
[01:07:21.677 --> 01:07:26.883]  I'm doing Benny Johnson show for a little while, but it'll be Owen and Chase.
[01:07:27.383 --> 01:07:30.346]  Then I'll be in here at 645 or so.
[01:07:31.427 --> 01:07:34.611]  Then I got a bunch of big guests coming on and analysis.
[01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:40.534]  Right up until 8 p.m., and then we'll be streaming the debate.
[01:07:41.154 --> 01:07:47.338]  You'll find it at RealAlexJones on X. If you're not on X, just go to Infowars.com forward slash show, and here's the thing.
[01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:49.560]  Share it with your email list.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.801]  Share it with your text message.
[01:07:50.821 --> 01:07:54.764]  Share it with your friends, your family, strangers, and say, hey, the debate's going to be huge tonight.
[01:07:54.964 --> 01:07:56.405]  They're saying it's going to have record viewers.
[01:07:56.465 --> 01:07:57.485]  Everybody I know is watching it.
[01:07:57.866 --> 01:07:59.867]  My mom says everybody she knows is watching it.
[01:08:04.568 --> 01:08:12.032]  We're going to be here with limited commentary, but we'll be calling out any shenanigans, and then we'll be tracking the corporate media.
[01:08:12.712 --> 01:08:15.313]  Here's the big takeaway, so let me start telling you what I believe is going to happen.
[01:08:17.074 --> 01:08:18.055]  There's so many angles to this.
[01:08:22.377 --> 01:08:30.041]  Trump is going to hit her because he's been training, not in classical debate where you actually have a debate with each other, but with Tulsi Gabbard a lot of time.
[01:08:31.448 --> 01:08:36.271]  And, uh, I confirmed that he knew she was and liked her, but now that he spent a bunch of time with her, he really likes her.
[01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:41.295]  He's like, well, I might've had her for VP, but he liked, he loves Kennedy too, but now he's all over her.
[01:08:41.315 --> 01:08:43.216]  He just thinks she's the best thing since sliced bread.
[01:08:43.757 --> 01:08:45.658]  The more time he spent with her reportedly, that's what happens.
[01:08:45.858 --> 01:08:51.022]  She's really smart and nice and has destroyed the democratic party.
[01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:53.524]  She's really effective, just as effective as RFK Jr.
[01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:58.107]  And he's extremely effective at liberals going, what's wrong with you?
[01:08:58.127 --> 01:08:58.947]  You're pro-war?
[01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:00.248]  You're pro-pedophilia?
[01:09:00.268 --> 01:09:03.609]  You're pro-open borders and mass crime and burning everything down?
[01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:04.629]  Well, what's your problem?
[01:09:05.969 --> 01:09:07.450]  But she, in fact, let's do this.
[01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.370]  I didn't think to do this.
[01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:10.051]  There's a lot of compilations of this.
[01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:11.151]  Some are like 10 minutes long.
[01:09:11.171 --> 01:09:11.771]  I don't want one of those.
[01:09:12.071 --> 01:09:15.352]  Get like a three-minute compilation of Tulsi Gabbard's destroying Kamala.
[01:09:16.973 --> 01:09:22.614]  Tulsi Gabbard's destroys Kamala at Democrat debate.
[01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:24.075]  It seems like
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.861]  A million years ago, but it was a year and a half ago.
[01:09:31.322 --> 01:09:32.442]  And they had those debates.
[01:09:32.482 --> 01:09:41.285]  I remember Harris was pulling at 2% and after Tulsi got a hold over, she went down to like half a percent in polls.
[01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:47.687]  All the polls should get 1% and then she dropped out, never getting one vote in the primaries that came later.
[01:09:49.668 --> 01:09:52.929]  And so Trump is going to go after her.
[01:09:56.122 --> 01:09:59.765]  On the fact that she put a bunch of innocent people in prison, she knew were innocent.
[01:10:00.645 --> 01:10:03.307]  If parents had a kid that missed one day of school, she'd try to throw him in jail.
[01:10:03.327 --> 01:10:04.448]  She started that national trend.
[01:10:04.468 --> 01:10:10.872]  And then when she was the Attorney General, she was even worse in California than when she was the DA in San Francisco.
[01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:17.597]  And she would particularly had a venomous behavior towards black people who were nonviolent.
[01:10:17.677 --> 01:10:21.620]  And it's, I mean, she was famous when she was the DA, I was covering her.
[01:10:23.524 --> 01:10:28.286]  And then she was really famous for being just Mrs. Police State when she was the Attorney General of California.
[01:10:30.287 --> 01:10:41.452]  And then when she was the VP pick of Biden, she suddenly was bailing out people that were burning down buildings and shooting at cops and helping fund the bail programs.
[01:10:41.592 --> 01:10:43.112]  Totally Soros, so flip-flopped.
[01:10:45.453 --> 01:10:46.054]  She's a monster.
[01:10:47.374 --> 01:10:51.136]  But I remember when she was the Attorney General, it's gotta be like,
[01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:53.750]  Eight years ago, this was breaking.
[01:10:53.770 --> 01:11:06.437]  You had those undercover pro-life journalists connected with LifeSite and a bunch of groups who would go in and caught the universities buying babies that were still alive, quote, still beating hearts for their experiments.
[01:11:07.837 --> 01:11:15.402]  And they would also catch them with undercover videos of them trying to, you know, I want a Ferrari.
[01:11:15.462 --> 01:11:16.502]  I want to sell more baby parts.
[01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:20.184]  That was totally legal under the First Amendment.
[01:11:20.204 --> 01:11:21.185]  Investigative journalism.
[01:11:23.194 --> 01:11:27.195]  She put them in jail for years and gave them multi-million dollar fines.
[01:11:27.296 --> 01:11:29.936]  I mean, this woman is a monster.
[01:11:30.957 --> 01:11:31.877]  So that's the first thing.
[01:11:31.897 --> 01:11:35.779]  We should talk about what I think Trump's going to do versus what he should do.
[01:11:36.999 --> 01:11:44.902]  He'll hit her on the border and he's going to hit her on the human trafficking, the 325,000 missing children in slave labor and sex slavery, and that she was the border czar.
[01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:55.856]  He needs to hit her on being a total police state thug and that Trump has a record of trying to decriminalize marijuana and let nonviolent offenders out so violent ones can be kept in, which I agree with.
[01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:59.056]  And that she doesn't, that she's a total fraud.
[01:12:00.257 --> 01:12:04.458]  He should hit her on never visiting the border but once.
[01:12:05.994 --> 01:12:11.878]  He should hit her on hiding in the basement and only doing one interview since she was installed.
[01:12:11.898 --> 01:12:15.261]  He should also go after her on the fact that you didn't get one vote in the primary.
[01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:16.662]  You were installed.
[01:12:17.142 --> 01:12:18.723]  A lot of experts believe that's even illegal.
[01:12:20.064 --> 01:12:26.149]  But he should say, I bet when you do a bad job tonight, they talk about replacing you again, which they're actually talking about.
[01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:27.110]  Vivica's one will happen.
[01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:28.311]  I've learned about it as well.
[01:12:30.172 --> 01:12:33.875]  And he should also go after her on the fact that you want to ban assault rifles.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:35.256]  That's any semi-automatic gun.
[01:12:36.513 --> 01:12:40.636]  You know, do you know only a hundred and something people die a year in mass shootings at schools, and most of those are gang-related?
[01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:49.824]  It's still too much, but you guys lied about my VP, JD Vance, when he said, it's terrible, we gotta stop it.
[01:12:51.525 --> 01:12:53.007]  We can't just let this be.
[01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:56.544]  A fact of life, these mass shootings.
[01:12:56.564 --> 01:13:00.467]  But you and your surrogates put out that he said, I don't care about mass shootings.
[01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:01.328]  It's a fact of life.
[01:13:01.948 --> 01:13:02.709]  You're a liar.
[01:13:02.969 --> 01:13:03.769]  You're a fraud.
[01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:08.373]  You lied and said inflation was lower under you than it is under me, and he should have that number.
[01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:12.015]  Roughly three to four times.
[01:13:12.276 --> 01:13:12.816]  It's varied.
[01:13:15.138 --> 01:13:15.258]  And
[01:13:17.116 --> 01:13:21.738]  She's gonna talk, she doesn't want the CNN rules where the mics are turned off.
[01:13:22.058 --> 01:13:35.622]  And it's apples or oranges, you can debate it square or round or whatever you want, but she doesn't want the mic turned off because she's gonna be throwing mindless little one-liners in that the media can say, ooh, dunked on Trump.
[01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:43.045]  So, know this, they'll declare her the winner, that's the number one thing, but
[01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:58.854]  The Washington Post, the New York Times, AP, they all reported that there are no Haitians doing any crimes or eating your cats or dogs or geese or chickens or ducks.
[01:13:59.855 --> 01:14:01.155]  Now, of course, we got videos of it.
[01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:01.995]  It's in the police reports.
[01:14:02.335 --> 01:14:03.475]  We have the squad car footage.
[01:14:03.495 --> 01:14:04.716]  We have the body cam footage.
[01:14:05.176 --> 01:14:11.357]  I mean, we have the insurance rates more than doubling with the Haitians driving around without driver's licenses wrecking.
[01:14:11.737 --> 01:14:13.038]  The police just told us, let them go.
[01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:13.858]  It's Sanctuary City.
[01:14:15.779 --> 01:14:16.820]  And they just say it's not true.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:17.900]  It's the same thing here.
[01:14:19.602 --> 01:14:26.206]  CNN, MSNBC, they're all gonna say, in my view, that Kamala won and won handily.
[01:14:28.748 --> 01:14:30.389]  If she didn't show up, they would say that.
[01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:35.532]  And that's why you see Pelosi saying Trump yesterday, Trump's scared he won't even show up.
[01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:38.034]  When Trump's the opposite, he can't wait to get up there.
[01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:39.595]  He has ice water in his veins.
[01:14:41.232 --> 01:14:43.553]  And I don't, you know, Trump's too hard on her.
[01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:45.535]  When she's being vicious, he'll say I was being mean to a woman.
[01:14:45.855 --> 01:14:47.196]  Nobody cares about that.
[01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:55.601]  She's up there, you know, on the stage, and she's been installed because she's a puppet, not because she's a woman.
[01:14:58.522 --> 01:15:00.083]  And then you got Drudge, J.D.
[01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:04.386]  Warren's blacks eating cats in his home state of Ohio, where he's a senator.
[01:15:04.406 --> 01:15:05.727]  He didn't say blacks are eating cats.
[01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:09.509]  He said third world, beyond third world Haitians are eating cats.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.081]  Put it back on screen, please.
[01:15:14.102 --> 01:15:14.983]  Blames Haitians.
[01:15:17.224 --> 01:15:18.645]  MAGA turns macabre.
[01:15:20.086 --> 01:15:25.110]  Well, Drudge, you used to be the number one site out there for news, but you really helped us out of them fours.
[01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:29.333]  But whatever went on with you, if you want to know what the Democrats are thinking and doing, you go to Drudge.
[01:15:29.353 --> 01:15:32.955]  I appreciate the link last week to our AI story.
[01:15:32.975 --> 01:15:33.616]  That was nice, Drudge.
[01:15:33.956 --> 01:15:34.456]  I don't even know.
[01:15:34.476 --> 01:15:35.397]  I haven't heard from Drudge in years.
[01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:44.539]  When he hung it up on X and deleted his account and it totally flipped, he put a nice thing up about me and Lana Del Rey.
[01:15:44.559 --> 01:15:48.622]  That was his last tweet about me and Lana Del Rey.
[01:15:48.642 --> 01:15:52.244]  I basically said, I love you guys, goodbye.
[01:15:52.304 --> 01:15:53.445]  I'm very touched by that.
[01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:54.846]  I touched whatever that is.
[01:15:54.866 --> 01:15:58.308]  You know, me and Drudge never dated.
[01:15:58.328 --> 01:16:03.231]  That was kind of a sweet thing to say, but who, where is Drudge?
[01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:04.893]  He hadn't been heard from in like six years.
[01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:07.354]  Or five years, four years.
[01:16:07.374 --> 01:16:08.035]  Yeah, about four and a half.
[01:16:09.033 --> 01:16:11.054]  So, I mean, you look at that.
[01:16:11.154 --> 01:16:13.576]  I mean, you got the Haitians running around foaming at the mouth.
[01:16:16.258 --> 01:16:17.919]  It's basically like Day of the Dead in Haiti.
[01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:22.242]  I mean, you cannot exaggerate how bad Haiti is, but I'm digressing.
[01:16:24.521 --> 01:16:26.421]  And I've got all that news I want to go through as well.
[01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:32.243]  But Biden's marijuana pardons don't cover hundreds of Kamala Harris had convicted.
[01:16:33.223 --> 01:16:33.803]  Not hundreds.
[01:16:34.743 --> 01:16:36.204]  When she was Attorney General, she was even worse.
[01:16:36.644 --> 01:16:39.444]  Here's how Kamala Harris really prosecuted marijuana cases.
[01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:41.005]  You ought to go read these articles viciously.
[01:16:41.685 --> 01:16:44.165]  Got a, you know, ounce of marijuana, five years in prison.
[01:16:45.826 --> 01:16:48.306]  Last known Californian in prison for federal cannabis charges.
[01:16:48.966 --> 01:16:50.027]  Released him for 15 years.
[01:16:50.067 --> 01:16:51.387]  Put in jail by Kamala Harris.
[01:16:53.823 --> 01:16:55.505]  Mandatory minimum sentences in California.
[01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:57.048]  What you need to know about Kamala Harris.
[01:16:59.351 --> 01:17:00.352]  She was enthusiastic.
[01:17:00.372 --> 01:17:02.815]  Remember when California was like one of the worst states for marijuana?
[01:17:04.978 --> 01:17:06.741]  Kamala Harris has evolved a marijuana policy.
[01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:07.262]  Here's how.
[01:17:11.553 --> 01:17:19.479]  Trump says on True Social, I have personally stated I believe it's time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.023]  We must also implement smart regulations while providing access to adults for safe tested products.
[01:17:24.803 --> 01:17:27.686]  As a Viridian, I will be voting yes on Amendment 3 in November.
[01:17:28.086 --> 01:17:37.934]  As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana, which is incredible, to secure Schedule 3, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws including safe banking,
[01:17:39.394 --> 01:17:46.141]  For state authorization companies and supporting state rights to pass marijuana laws like Florida that work so well for the citizens.
[01:17:49.605 --> 01:17:53.228]  Now here's the issue, and I said this on Joe Rogan about seven years ago.
[01:17:53.248 --> 01:17:54.470]  It became a big national story.
[01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:58.614]  Alex Jones says George Soros is making the marijuana stronger.
[01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:10.340]  I was going off mainline studies going back 30 years ago, Soros began to fund genetic engineers, he was one of the main funders, other groups did it as well, to create marijuana that's different.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.820]  And I'm not the expert, but I've rubbed, here's the gestalt.
[01:18:14.501 --> 01:18:16.781]  There's Indiconstitutiva, they both do different things.
[01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:18.621]  One makes you relax and want to eat a bunch of food.
[01:18:19.021 --> 01:18:21.482]  The other makes you think, but also can make you kind of paranoid.
[01:18:22.702 --> 01:18:25.562]  And, you know, I mean, I know I'm somebody that really never has fear.
[01:18:25.983 --> 01:18:28.503]  I have fear of failure, fear of the tyrants winning, but it's not like I'm scared.
[01:18:30.865 --> 01:18:37.068]  You know, I'll be out at the family ranch and, you know, it's 10 o'clock at night and I love walking by myself in the deep woods at night.
[01:18:37.788 --> 01:18:42.230]  And I won't even usually take, I'll take maybe a flashlight in case I need it, but if the moon's out, I won't.
[01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:49.293]  And there's something even cooler about not even taking a gun with you because it's lighter and I'm not going to really, and so I like, it's that primitive thing of not even having a weapon.
[01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:56.916]  And I'll go for a two hour walk, you know, into the woods, but I'll also walk when it's pitch black and I can just follow the,
[01:18:59.161 --> 01:19:06.108]  My dad's property is mainly, you know, sand in the woods, so I can see the sand path barely and just your eyes open up for a while, the night vision gets better and better.
[01:19:06.168 --> 01:19:07.068]  It's just you're high.
[01:19:07.129 --> 01:19:07.469]  I do it.
[01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:13.014]  And I've had buddies over some of the years, or high school friends, you know, hey, let's go for a walk in the dark.
[01:19:13.034 --> 01:19:14.375]  They're like, this is spooky.
[01:19:14.596 --> 01:19:16.437]  After about 30 minutes, let's go back.
[01:19:16.457 --> 01:19:17.138]  I don't like this.
[01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.399]  They're hearing sounds and stuff.
[01:19:19.861 --> 01:19:22.163]  My point is, is that I don't scare easily.
[01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:34.006]  I am absolutely just horrified for our children.
[01:19:34.086 --> 01:19:34.906]  It's a different type of fear.
[01:19:34.926 --> 01:19:38.528]  It's like a responsibility of letting people in power.
[01:19:38.588 --> 01:19:46.391]  But the point was about marijuana is that I smoke marijuana literally maximum a few times a year.
[01:19:47.852 --> 01:19:57.897]  It's always with Joe Rogan because he always has the right kind of stuff that doesn't make me feel paranoid or crazy or like I want to just sit there and eat a gallon of ice cream.
[01:19:59.062 --> 01:20:01.985]  And one hit off of it and it's like, it's amazing.
[01:20:03.406 --> 01:20:12.816]  And then I'll try other people's marijuana over the years and it just, it's just, and one time I smoked some about 10 years ago and I'm just like, I felt my heart beating.
[01:20:12.856 --> 01:20:16.299]  I thought I was gonna, I was all looking through the blinds and paranoid.
[01:20:17.782 --> 01:20:24.746]  And the reason I raise this is I know a lot of people, some of them very close to me, that became artificial schizophrenics.
[01:20:25.146 --> 01:20:27.188]  You know, they weren't schizophrenic because of genetics or whatever.
[01:20:27.788 --> 01:20:33.231]  They were schizophrenic the same way people that worked in clothing manufacturing 200 years ago were.
[01:20:33.251 --> 01:20:40.796]  They're called mad as a hatter because they would dry out and stain and do processes on things, on like, you know, say a beaver hat.
[01:20:41.846 --> 01:20:42.246]  We're good to go.
[01:20:57.216 --> 01:20:58.137]  Basically schizophrenia.
[01:20:58.197 --> 01:20:58.997]  And now it's admitted.
[01:20:59.017 --> 01:21:01.819]  But now when I said it seven years ago on Joe, people didn't know about it.
[01:21:01.859 --> 01:21:02.279]  Oh, he's crazy.
[01:21:02.299 --> 01:21:12.685]  But now you type in marijuana linked to mental illness, marijuana linked to schizophrenia, marijuana linked to... And I have had people that I know well and one person that worked here.
[01:21:13.606 --> 01:21:20.130]  No, actually two over the last... These two cases both happened in the last 16 years.
[01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:23.792]  One of them was about 14 years ago and then one of them was about four years ago.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.343]  And both these people smoked dope all the time.
[01:21:28.363 --> 01:21:29.163]  They were video editors.
[01:21:30.004 --> 01:21:32.546]  They knew it at the office, and I was just like, that's how it is with video editors.
[01:21:32.886 --> 01:21:35.168]  They'd come in stoned in the morning, go out to lunch, get stoned.
[01:21:35.568 --> 01:21:36.309]  We had to work late.
[01:21:36.409 --> 01:21:37.670]  You know, they were just stoned out of their gourd.
[01:21:38.691 --> 01:21:41.673]  And one of them started thinking we had microphones hidden in his office.
[01:21:42.594 --> 01:21:45.216]  And then he decided that David Knight was really a reptile.
[01:21:45.336 --> 01:21:47.437]  I swear to God, really an alien.
[01:21:48.758 --> 01:21:51.981]  And we had a state rep here, and he refused to work and told me, well, that guy's a lizard.
[01:21:54.329 --> 01:21:56.851]  And then he just went completely nuts and basically quit.
[01:21:58.052 --> 01:21:59.553]  And is now completely out of his gourd.
[01:22:01.595 --> 01:22:07.359]  And there was another employee that got super paranoid and left.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:19.168]  And then I didn't even follow the guy, but people later asked me, they're like, hey, this guy is on his website saying that you sent a bird to his chimney to talk to him.
[01:22:20.475 --> 01:22:23.217]  And I went and looked on his thing, and he was saying, Alex Jones is harassing me.
[01:22:23.917 --> 01:22:27.299]  Alex Jones has sent a bird to talk down my chimney.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.281]  And then his dad died of a heart attack, and he told people I killed him.
[01:22:31.461 --> 01:22:32.202]  Never even met his dad.
[01:22:33.403 --> 01:22:34.883]  So, I mean, that's marijuana.
[01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:41.487]  These people were normal and smart and nice, and whatever the marijuana was that started coming out made them insane.
[01:22:42.788 --> 01:22:43.509]  So young people.
[01:22:44.468 --> 01:22:45.028]  Don't do it.
[01:22:45.568 --> 01:22:51.549]  If it's medical, or it's from a doctor, or it's a certain type, but just, just, even Snoop Dogg stopped smoking marijuana.
[01:22:51.569 --> 01:22:55.910]  Alright, I said I was talking about the debate, but I just digressed.
[01:22:56.150 --> 01:23:01.552]  And, you know, I tell these stories because that's the best way to reach young people, is not saying, if you ever smoke that, you're gonna die, or don't you ever touch that, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:01.912 --> 01:23:03.532]  Instead, it's like, it could be laced with fentanyl.
[01:23:03.552 --> 01:23:04.872]  A lot of people die like that.
[01:23:05.672 --> 01:23:09.513]  Plus these off, off, you know, label vapes that keep killing people.
[01:23:11.274 --> 01:23:12.754]  And, I'm just telling folks.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.142]  Prescription drugs on average, psychotropics will destroy your life.
[01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.043]  The illegal drugs will destroy your life.
[01:23:19.503 --> 01:23:20.384]  Stay away from it.
[01:23:20.724 --> 01:23:23.246]  Don't take a pill if somebody gives it to you saying it's ecstasy.
[01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:25.647]  Almost all of it is spiked with fentanyl.
[01:23:25.747 --> 01:23:27.688]  Do not get close to it.
[01:23:28.869 --> 01:23:29.269]  There it is.
[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.310]  Big study.
[01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:34.352]  Young men at higher risk of schizophrenia linked to cannabis use disorder.
[01:23:34.993 --> 01:23:36.033]  That's even a disorder now.
[01:23:36.554 --> 01:23:37.594]  National Institutes of Health.
[01:23:38.335 --> 01:23:38.555]  U.S.
[01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:38.915]  government.
[01:23:40.056 --> 01:23:41.437]  Believe me, I don't need to read a study.
[01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:51.473]  I got a lot of friends and family that have got young people in their family that were top of their class, and now they're ruined by marijuana.
[01:23:52.474 --> 01:23:55.858]  Now, CBD is the good stuff that doesn't get you high at all, and it's magic.
[01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:56.759]  The plant's incredible.
[01:23:59.062 --> 01:24:02.486]  And you know, the stuff we had in high school, taking a few hits, go watch a movie was kind of fun.
[01:24:02.806 --> 01:24:05.609]  I was never a pothead, but the new stuff is dangerous.
[01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:06.890]  We'll be right back with your phone call.
[01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:07.271]  Stay with us.
[01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:08.112]  The year is 2030.
[01:24:08.272 --> 01:24:15.219]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[01:24:15.339 --> 01:24:18.903]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[01:24:19.183 --> 01:24:21.746]  It's bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:26.848]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[01:24:27.088 --> 01:24:28.869]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:32.051]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the InfoWar.
[01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:36.213]  Visit InfoWarStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:41.073]  All right, I'm going to stop pontificating off into marijuana and stuff.
[01:24:41.473 --> 01:24:44.276]  I just start thinking about how bad it is and how many people it's hurting.
[01:24:44.536 --> 01:24:51.302]  And again, it's because all these big companies, including biotech companies, for 30 years have been squirreling with it and jacking with it.
[01:24:52.145 --> 01:24:54.126]  And it is something completely different than it was.
[01:24:54.146 --> 01:24:55.067]  It's like they've taken wheat.
[01:24:55.767 --> 01:24:57.668]  Nobody had gluten intolerance 30 years ago.
[01:24:57.688 --> 01:25:01.890]  And now they've genetically changed it and then spray it with all these different poisons like glyphosate.
[01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:05.472]  Not when it's growing out of the ground so bugs don't eat it and then it dissipates.
[01:25:05.732 --> 01:25:10.994]  They spray it a week before they harvest it because it makes fungus not grow and then you eat the damn stuff.
[01:25:11.014 --> 01:25:12.375]  But it's a lot of things.
[01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:14.816]  I'm looking to get them a sponsor.
[01:25:14.836 --> 01:25:15.477]  There's a big company.
[01:25:16.437 --> 01:25:19.440]  In Utah that supplies high-end Italian restaurants.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.822]  I learned about this through a guy that owns an Italian restaurant.
[01:25:21.902 --> 01:25:24.124]  I've gotten some of it, and my daughter has gluten intolerance.
[01:25:24.144 --> 01:25:24.724]  She's a seven-year-old.
[01:25:24.744 --> 01:25:25.505]  She doesn't get it from this.
[01:25:25.925 --> 01:25:31.890]  And it's old, original seeds from Italy that grows the wheat they were eating a thousand years ago.
[01:25:32.891 --> 01:25:36.094]  So again, they're manipulating these plants, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:37.235 --> 01:25:38.636]  Okay, I'm going to shift gears out of that.
[01:25:40.238 --> 01:25:42.680]  Trump needs to also hit Kamala tonight during the debate about
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:51.186]  How she tried to put forward three plans with Biden that she pushed to, quote, end the border problem by totally opening the border and legalizing all illegals.
[01:25:51.566 --> 01:25:58.612]  She finally posted, as you know, yesterday, her policies, and it's exactly what Biden's been doing and what she's been saying, just worse.
[01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:03.676]  And it totally legalizes all the illegal aliens, anyone who, quote, crosses the border illegally.
[01:26:04.957 --> 01:26:08.300]  So I want to ask listeners, what other tricks do you think she'll pull?
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.602]  And when she has a disastrous performance,
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:19.823]  The corporate media will try to prop her up and say she won, but when the public doesn't buy it, like they did with Biden, will they try to replace her?
[01:26:19.843 --> 01:26:20.803]  And you're like, well, that's crazy.
[01:26:20.823 --> 01:26:22.323]  We're only 55 days out.
[01:26:22.864 --> 01:26:23.704]  Everything's crazy.
[01:26:23.724 --> 01:26:33.367]  They stole the election from Biden, wouldn't let anybody run against him in the primaries that was serious, that didn't drop out, and then installed her.
[01:26:35.468 --> 01:26:36.868]  That's what happens when countries go corrupt.
[01:26:36.888 --> 01:26:38.469]  They start replacing leaders every few months.
[01:26:42.048 --> 01:26:44.689]  And yeah, now the new policy she put out is literally plagiarized.
[01:26:44.749 --> 01:26:46.710]  It's just Biden's platform, word for word.
[01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:49.531]  Well, because it's the same group.
[01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:51.111]  It's not plagiarized.
[01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:54.232]  It's run by Obama and the globalists.
[01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:54.512]  877-789-2539.
[01:26:55.473 --> 01:26:57.093]  The phones have been loaded.
[01:26:57.113 --> 01:26:57.933]  877-789-2539.
[01:26:58.074 --> 01:27:03.836]  And as soon as we go through these calls, I will take more calls for longtime callers, you name it.
[01:27:03.896 --> 01:27:06.316]  Right now, it's first-time callers and the first bank of calls.
[01:27:06.997 --> 01:27:07.657]  We got Brennan.
[01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:14.363]  Sean, Scott, Dave, Derek, Melissa, Crystal, Nick, Roxanne, and others.
[01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:17.807]  And Dave in Arizona is first.
[01:27:19.269 --> 01:27:21.612]  He thinks that Kamala will win tonight.
[01:27:21.692 --> 01:27:22.513]  Okay, tell me, Dave.
[01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:22.814]  Thank you.
[01:27:24.565 --> 01:27:29.128]  Yeah, so I disagree with what's flown around in the conservative circles.
[01:27:29.268 --> 01:27:30.668]  And thank you again for all you do.
[01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.349]  I'm glad I found you in May of this year.
[01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:35.991]  So I don't think she'll pull this chameleon stuff.
[01:27:36.512 --> 01:27:40.294]  I think she'll be candid about what she wants to do, this nihilist Marxist approach.
[01:27:40.994 --> 01:27:48.840]  Because they control the lamestream media, and I think that what will end up happening, because it seems every 20 minutes they need a narrative change, right?
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.301]  We need the newest, hottest story.
[01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:56.965]  It'll be that Biden pardons Hunter, and then resigns, and she's the 47th president.
[01:27:57.065 --> 01:27:59.447]  And then the lamestream media will have the narrative.
[01:28:00.027 --> 01:28:01.490]  Contrary to what other people are thinking.
[01:28:02.011 --> 01:28:04.474]  She'll be the first black president according to them.
[01:28:04.494 --> 01:28:10.123]  And they'll say when people went in to pull the lever, they couldn't vote for a convicted felon.
[01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:13.369]  And congratulations, she got a full term as president.
[01:28:15.267 --> 01:28:17.688]  That's what Roger Stone is most concerned about.
[01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:21.530]  And so, yeah, they could dump her, but I think you're right.
[01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:22.671]  That's why I love taking calls.
[01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:25.753]  There's a very good chance that'll make her look presidential.
[01:28:26.453 --> 01:28:28.814]  And they'll say, oh, it's the first woman president.
[01:28:29.535 --> 01:28:33.357]  And because of that, they'll say, we've got to elect her now, and that'll be the excuse to steal it.
[01:28:33.857 --> 01:28:36.221]  And they think that will so convince us that she really won.
[01:28:36.241 --> 01:28:38.865]  That's why they had to get rid of Biden, because nobody would believe him.
[01:28:38.885 --> 01:28:39.946]  He stole it the second time.
[01:28:40.307 --> 01:28:41.128]  I think you're dead on.
[01:28:41.168 --> 01:28:43.692]  In fact, I'm glad you called, because that's really what Roger's saying.
[01:28:43.732 --> 01:28:45.315]  And I don't know why I didn't say that.
[01:28:45.335 --> 01:28:46.416]  That's why we take your calls.
[01:28:46.437 --> 01:28:47.078]  What else do you want to say?
[01:28:48.587 --> 01:28:49.869]  Well, I'm here in State 48.
[01:28:49.989 --> 01:28:55.256]  I've been boots on the ground since 2019 when they started impeaching President Trump.
[01:28:55.296 --> 01:28:57.179]  I wasn't originally a President Trump fan.
[01:28:57.559 --> 01:29:00.363]  I voted against Hillary in 2016.
[01:29:00.804 --> 01:29:02.306]  So, in fact, I voted for him.
[01:29:02.626 --> 01:29:04.870]  But I wasn't a Trump guy from day one.
[01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:12.875]  But I saw the whole of government corruption, and that's what every story is now, Alex, and you and your crew pointed out so well.
[01:29:13.315 --> 01:29:32.948]  All the stuff with the illegals in Ohio and Colorado, it's to destroy our way of life, and it's all intentional, because what they want to do is they want to pit different classes of people, illegals versus American citizens at the low end of the economic structure, against each other, so we take our eyes
[01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:35.531]  Off of our psychopathic overlords.
[01:29:36.011 --> 01:29:39.355]  And here in Arizona, we have problems with our GOP party.
[01:29:39.796 --> 01:29:40.677]  They were in control in 2020, 2021, 2022.
[01:29:40.797 --> 01:29:43.180]  We have an installed governor in 2023, but they made no reforms to our election laws.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.602]  So they will steal state 48, Carrie Lake,
[01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:58.635]  And the rest of them didn't win in 2022 because they continue to steal our voices and our votes.
[01:29:59.055 --> 01:30:01.317]  It's not really about President Trump or Carrie Lake for me.
[01:30:01.677 --> 01:30:02.318]  It's about me.
[01:30:02.338 --> 01:30:04.439]  I don't have any representation here, sir.
[01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:05.119]  Thank you.
[01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:07.981]  Great call.
[01:30:08.121 --> 01:30:11.984]  Really scary points that I have to say is a real probability.
[01:30:12.044 --> 01:30:12.824]  I think you nailed it.
[01:30:13.285 --> 01:30:13.665]  Thank you.
[01:30:14.145 --> 01:30:15.146]  He nailed it, didn't he?
[01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:17.447]  That's why we take your calls.
[01:30:18.652 --> 01:30:23.635]  Most of the time, callers are smarter than I am, because I've known when he's saying it's true, and then he just said it, and I'm like, oh, I didn't say that.
[01:30:23.655 --> 01:30:25.036]  Well, we take your calls.
[01:30:25.576 --> 01:30:27.137]  Derek in California, you're on the air.
[01:30:27.177 --> 01:30:27.578]  Go ahead.
[01:30:28.958 --> 01:30:30.820]  My prediction is that the debate won't happen.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:42.427]  A few weeks ago, to honor the vision that I had, the specific words, and it was pretty powerful as it showered me with, it opened doorways, and I had tears falling down my cheeks for like 15 minutes.
[01:30:42.507 --> 01:30:45.829]  And the words were, the nuke is in Delaware.
[01:30:46.485 --> 01:30:57.308]  The nuke is in Delaware, so my prediction is that it's a travesty what's going to happen because what's-his-name will beat what's-her-name in this debate.
[01:30:58.329 --> 01:31:02.670]  And it will not just beat her, but shred her if the debate is allowed to happen.
[01:31:02.710 --> 01:31:06.151]  In fact, probably the best case scenario is to allow the debate to happen.
[01:31:06.191 --> 01:31:14.234]  That's what I pray for, is that this debate will happen and that my vision doesn't happen and we merge into a reality of a peaceful... Have you had visions that come true before?
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.042]  Oh yeah, and dreams.
[01:31:16.082 --> 01:31:16.903]  They're in my family.
[01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:21.891]  It's a genetic trait that goes back through my mother for many, many generations.
[01:31:24.975 --> 01:31:26.177]  Mine too, to a certain extent.
[01:31:26.297 --> 01:31:29.322]  So, expanding on that,
[01:31:30.615 --> 01:31:42.625]  I have warned that they could set a nuke off and kill Biden or Trump and blame Iran and launch World War III, then activate sleeper cells, and Iran will actually attack, but that the globals will actually attack and use that to bring in a total collapse in martial law.
[01:31:42.925 --> 01:31:43.886]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:31:43.906 --> 01:31:46.948]  I didn't have a vision of that, but I politically have been warning of that.
[01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:48.309]  I hope you're wrong.
[01:31:48.329 --> 01:31:51.192]  We're going to find out in the next seven hours here, buddy.
[01:31:52.693 --> 01:31:53.774]  I hope I'm wrong too.
[01:31:53.794 --> 01:31:57.477]  In fact, if the debate does go down and it happens to be a
[01:31:58.629 --> 01:32:00.954]  Uh, a total shredding of Kamala.
[01:32:01.936 --> 01:32:04.461]  It's still not too late for him to pull these things out.
[01:32:04.582 --> 01:32:05.143]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:32:05.163 --> 01:32:09.152]  God also gives us visions of possible futures so we can speak to it and stop it.
[01:32:10.123 --> 01:32:11.084]  And that's my prayer.
[01:32:11.104 --> 01:32:19.048]  Well, I have a brother who had plans to go to that area this next week, and he canceled his plans based on this.
[01:32:19.088 --> 01:32:21.909]  So maybe it was a personal vision for a family member.
[01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:30.434]  But anyone who's hearing this, if I were in Delaware right now, I'd get the freak out and get this Central States, Arizona, Utah, Idaho.
[01:32:30.814 --> 01:32:31.134]  All right.
[01:32:31.174 --> 01:32:31.915]  Thank you for the call.
[01:32:32.695 --> 01:32:33.856]  And I'm on record saying this.
[01:32:34.756 --> 01:32:35.917]  I can see it politically going on.
[01:32:35.957 --> 01:32:37.598]  So you can say it was my subconscious and then did it.
[01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.319]  But I saw the towers on fire.
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.301]  I talked about this 20 plus years ago.
[01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:43.683]  And I went on air, not in July.
[01:32:43.743 --> 01:32:44.803]  That's the clip that's popular.
[01:32:44.823 --> 01:32:52.169]  I went on the air in April and said they're going to blow up the World Trade Centers and blame Bin Laden and invade the Middle East.
[01:32:52.289 --> 01:32:56.332]  And Chase Geiser has actually found that clip.
[01:32:57.612 --> 01:33:06.238]  And so, but maybe I, it's a collective unconscious because I didn't know they were making a Lone Gunman episode of exactly that happening at the same time they aired right before 9-11.
[01:33:06.958 --> 01:33:08.959]  And then I didn't see it because I didn't really watch a lot of entertainment TV.
[01:33:09.019 --> 01:33:10.120]  I'll watch almost none now.
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:13.622]  And then after 9-11 people, and back then the internet didn't have clips everywhere.
[01:33:14.223 --> 01:33:17.685]  There was very few video clips, little short clips on like CNN, ABC News.
[01:33:17.885 --> 01:33:19.846]  There were like 10 seconds because the bandwidth cost so much.
[01:33:21.107 --> 01:33:24.289]  And so it wasn't a few months into 9-11, after 9-11, I got a VHS tape
[01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:27.918]  In the mail.
[01:33:28.378 --> 01:33:29.639]  So we could play the audio on air.
[01:33:30.419 --> 01:33:39.322]  And we did have a document cam shot that we put out, like Limbaugh did, and like Art Bell did, where every second or two, the bandwidth wasn't too much, you'd have a shot of what you were showing.
[01:33:39.342 --> 01:33:39.902]  So I had that.
[01:33:41.183 --> 01:33:46.565]  But I could air the audio on the show, and I was like, I didn't know the lone gunman spinoff of the X-Files.
[01:33:47.779 --> 01:33:54.183]  Had a whole episode about hijacking a jumbo jet to fly it into the World Trade Center to collapse the tower and blame Afghanistan and invade them.
[01:33:54.203 --> 01:33:57.205]  And then I talked to Chris Carter later and he said, no, the CIA told us to do that production.
[01:33:58.386 --> 01:33:59.486]  And he told Vanity Fair that.
[01:33:59.506 --> 01:34:00.847]  Or was it Variety?
[01:34:00.887 --> 01:34:01.508]  It was Variety.
[01:34:02.495 --> 01:34:05.017]  So, if you're a new listener and you're hearing this, you can look this up.
[01:34:05.117 --> 01:34:06.077]  I mean, this sounds nuts.
[01:34:06.178 --> 01:34:07.598]  So, I never saw that.
[01:34:07.658 --> 01:34:08.619]  No one told me that.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.101]  I was just seeing the evidence and what was going on.
[01:34:12.141 --> 01:34:16.865]  They bombed the World Trade Center before the Feds had, and cooked up the bomb, and ordered them to carry it out.
[01:34:17.445 --> 01:34:22.669]  And I'd had a mod salam, the guy that blew the whistle and tried to stop it, the head FBI informant on.
[01:34:23.509 --> 01:34:28.252]  And so I knew they wanted to get rid of the towers, and I was seeing a lot of programming, and they were saying Bin Laden's about to get us.
[01:34:29.153 --> 01:34:32.075]  But then I had dreams of the smoking, burning towers, not of planes.
[01:34:32.995 --> 01:34:36.597]  And so when it happened, I was like, whoa, and I predicted it months before perfectly.
[01:34:37.317 --> 01:34:38.137]  So this stuff's real.
[01:34:39.238 --> 01:34:39.838]  I hope he's wrong.
[01:34:39.858 --> 01:34:41.038]  Hope a nuke doesn't go off in Delaware.
[01:34:41.058 --> 01:34:46.640]  Yeah, there's even TV Guide, the September 11th Parallel, nobody noticed.
[01:34:47.601 --> 01:34:49.422]  March of 2001, to be exact, episode 151 of The Gunman.
[01:34:55.475 --> 01:34:58.996]  Premiered with an episode featuring a terrorist plot to fly a commercial airline into a World Trade Center.
[01:34:59.656 --> 01:35:06.717]  The climactic sequence actually shows the plane heading into one of the Twin Towers, but at the last minute, pulled upward, just missing the building.
[01:35:06.777 --> 01:35:15.038]  Shockingly, this horrifying bit of foreshadowing was never widely reported until Thursday, when Industry Newsletter, The Mirror's report, broke the story.
[01:35:15.479 --> 01:35:18.079]  How is it that virtually no one remembered this post 9-11?
[01:35:18.419 --> 01:35:18.719]  I know.
[01:35:19.659 --> 01:35:20.279]  I've been wondering.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:23.120]  So,
[01:35:24.637 --> 01:35:25.358]  Yeah, that was the thing.
[01:35:25.378 --> 01:35:28.381]  Back then, there wasn't instant stuff on YouTube or Twitter.
[01:35:29.882 --> 01:35:30.703]  YouTube didn't exist.
[01:35:32.144 --> 01:35:34.966]  And so I had listeners, I remember going, did you see the X-Files?
[01:35:34.986 --> 01:35:37.168]  Like, no, they'd tell me about it, but it would just be a rumor.
[01:35:37.869 --> 01:35:40.792]  Kind of like, I've been on air since it happened that morning.
[01:35:41.793 --> 01:35:42.553]  I hadn't eaten yet.
[01:35:42.573 --> 01:35:44.535]  It was a pizza place a half mile from the house.
[01:35:44.735 --> 01:35:48.559]  I ordered the pizza, back in the old day, call on the phone, got in the car, it's like four,
[01:35:49.602 --> 01:35:50.883]  Whatever it was, right when they blew up Building 7.
[01:35:51.883 --> 01:35:53.885]  And CBS News, still had CBS Radio.
[01:35:53.905 --> 01:35:55.085]  It was on 590 AM.
[01:35:55.826 --> 01:35:57.807]  Station I've been on, as a host.
[01:35:58.748 --> 01:35:59.268]  That's what I had it.
[01:35:59.468 --> 01:36:01.550]  And I'm driving up, and I'm eating the pizza, driving home.
[01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:03.851]  I remember sitting there in the parking lot.
[01:36:04.972 --> 01:36:06.613]  And again, didn't have phones back then that recorded it.
[01:36:06.633 --> 01:36:07.093]  I recorded it.
[01:36:08.354 --> 01:36:09.214]  And I'm eating the pizza.
[01:36:10.715 --> 01:36:13.497]  To young people I know, hear this stuff, they go, how is it you didn't record it?
[01:36:13.537 --> 01:36:14.518]  How is it you didn't put it on?
[01:36:14.998 --> 01:36:16.059]  That stuff didn't exist!
[01:36:17.858 --> 01:36:19.479]  Unless you had it ready and had a camera ready.
[01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.440]  And I'm sittin' there eatin' that delicious sausage and pepperoni pizza, still remember it.
[01:36:25.641 --> 01:36:26.481]  But burned in my memory.
[01:36:27.302 --> 01:36:27.982]  Pavlovianly.
[01:36:28.622 --> 01:36:30.243]  I'm sittin' in the parking lot of my house, eatin' the pizza.
[01:36:31.783 --> 01:36:33.924]  And I'm listenin' to CBS, and they're like, they're gonna bring down 7.
[01:36:34.144 --> 01:36:36.005]  We'll control the militia so it doesn't hurt other buildings.
[01:36:36.825 --> 01:36:38.986]  They're gonna control the militia here in just a few minutes.
[01:36:39.066 --> 01:36:40.527]  And then, okay, the building has fallen.
[01:36:40.547 --> 01:36:41.387]  They've destroyed the building.
[01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:44.383]  And I go in there and say, well, they just said they blew up a building.
[01:36:44.403 --> 01:36:45.323]  Have anybody heard about that?
[01:36:45.864 --> 01:36:49.306]  And it wasn't three years later that they decided to archive it all on NBC.
[01:36:50.447 --> 01:36:51.808]  And boom, we had the videos.
[01:36:53.549 --> 01:37:01.215]  So, I mean, I can play clips of you on CBS, CNN, BBC saying they're going to blow the building up.
[01:37:02.796 --> 01:37:03.457]  And then PBS.
[01:37:05.162 --> 01:37:08.264]  And then I interviewed the people that were there, the cops and firemen that were there.
[01:37:08.884 --> 01:37:11.146]  I found them, got them on the show, who heard the countdown.
[01:37:11.566 --> 01:37:13.107]  Get back, they're blowing it up, they're blowing it up!
[01:37:15.609 --> 01:37:23.211]  So back then, until after 9-11, way after no one even pointed out, hey, there was an X-Files show with like 10 million viewers about this.
[01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:24.112]  I'm digressing.
[01:37:24.892 --> 01:37:26.352]  It just shows how the mind works.
[01:37:26.392 --> 01:37:28.993]  You see, that's how they can manipulate us because most people don't even pay attention.
[01:37:29.393 --> 01:37:30.394]  Week-to-week, day-to-day.
[01:37:30.414 --> 01:37:31.874]  A month ago is a thousand years ago.
[01:37:32.394 --> 01:37:37.496]  You're trying to tell them, hey, they admitted in 1945 they started putting fluoride in the water that it causes brain damage.
[01:37:37.816 --> 01:37:41.597]  And then it came out a month ago, the government goes, we've always known, big deal, we're gonna keep doing it.
[01:37:42.898 --> 01:37:43.658]  Reuters, AP.
[01:37:44.478 --> 01:37:46.059]  And you still tell somebody and they laugh at you.
[01:37:46.079 --> 01:37:48.459]  You go, oh yeah, the government's putting something in the water to hurt me.
[01:37:48.499 --> 01:37:50.700]  You know, it just, it doesn't sound real.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:52.780]  But it is.
[01:37:54.781 --> 01:38:04.523]  Just like the head of the British government task force on the shot, Bauer, at the Crick Institute, saying, yeah, it erases your immune system.
[01:38:04.964 --> 01:38:05.844]  It's gonna be great for business.
[01:38:06.984 --> 01:38:08.044]  People don't have immune systems anymore.
[01:38:08.084 --> 01:38:09.405]  You'll have to give them shots for everything.
[01:38:10.145 --> 01:38:10.525]  You're like, what?
[01:38:12.287 --> 01:38:14.948]  He said it almost four years ago, and now it's happened.
[01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:18.229]  I mean, yeah, there I am.
[01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:21.751]  I later interviewed the star of The Lone Gunman Show.
[01:38:23.692 --> 01:38:25.392]  One day, he just shows up at my door.
[01:38:25.412 --> 01:38:30.594]  And of course, he'd been big on The X-Files as well, but all of a sudden, he calls me.
[01:38:30.634 --> 01:38:31.815]  He goes, hey, I found out where you live.
[01:38:31.855 --> 01:38:32.775]  Can I come over today?
[01:38:32.795 --> 01:38:34.556]  And I said, yeah, hell, an hour.
[01:38:34.656 --> 01:38:34.916]  Boom.
[01:38:35.736 --> 01:38:37.377]  Here he comes to my door, and I go, well, come on the show tomorrow.
[01:38:37.397 --> 01:38:37.997]  And he came on the show.
[01:38:38.357 --> 01:38:39.038]  I forget his name.
[01:38:39.078 --> 01:38:39.398]  What is it?
[01:38:41.516 --> 01:38:44.197]  Dean Hagelin, yeah, and how the CIA planted the story on him.
[01:38:44.237 --> 01:38:45.537]  I mean, I've talked to these people.
[01:38:45.577 --> 01:38:55.639]  I'm not... Hear New Lizard, like, oh, yeah, you talked to, you know, the head of the X-Files, Chris Carter, and, oh, yeah, you had the host of the X-Files on, telling him, oh, yeah, sure you did.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.400]  Yeah, folks, I did it all.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.660]  I'm not making up damn thing here.
[01:39:00.461 --> 01:39:01.141]  I wish I was.
[01:39:01.221 --> 01:39:02.181]  I wish this wasn't true.
[01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:03.201]  God almighty.
[01:39:06.842 --> 01:39:08.002]  It's weird as you get older.
[01:39:08.023 --> 01:39:09.803]  I always heard as you get older, you get more and more nostalgic.
[01:39:10.993 --> 01:39:18.378]  And by nostalgic, it's just... You start all the crazy experiences, you start... Because I've always lived in the present and the future.
[01:39:19.879 --> 01:39:22.440]  But I just can't help more and more live in the past.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:25.882]  I still live, like, 20% of the past, but I used to not live in the past at all.
[01:39:27.584 --> 01:39:37.150]  Like, I never used to think back to memories of stuff other than what's news, and now I'm just, like, having all these great memories when I was a kid and fishing with grandpa, grandma... Anyways, I digress.
[01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:39.051]  The debate's coming up, folks!
[01:39:40.694 --> 01:39:43.895]  The debate's coming up in seven hours and 11 minutes.
[01:39:44.515 --> 01:39:47.196]  Live coverage starts now, been going today.
[01:39:49.137 --> 01:39:49.877]  But 6 p.m.
[01:39:49.937 --> 01:39:56.639]  Central, share those links for the live feed of the debate at realalexjones, band.video, and infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:07.643]  Because I'm not jealous and I'm not in competition, but we only had five, six million viewers when we covered the Trump-Biden debate.
[01:40:08.717 --> 01:40:10.638]  Hey Alex, this is Melissa from North Carolina.
[01:40:11.198 --> 01:40:12.398]  Thanks for giving us a voice.
[01:40:12.418 --> 01:40:12.698]  Thank you.
[01:40:38.386 --> 01:40:41.569]  My ex account is looking for parts.
[01:40:42.349 --> 01:40:45.351]  I've been a Trump supporter since 2016.
[01:40:45.952 --> 01:40:46.692]  I am MAGA.
[01:40:47.153 --> 01:40:47.913]  Never strayed away.
[01:40:49.674 --> 01:40:54.938]  My talking points are, is that Kamala can't think and talk at the same time.
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.902]  And that she shows signs that she has like ADD.
[01:40:59.922 --> 01:41:05.446]  She bounces around, swings her head around, all that laughing and talking.
[01:41:05.987 --> 01:41:10.168]  So my point is, I think she's going to be hyped up on Adderall.
[01:41:12.029 --> 01:41:25.532]  And I think she's going to try those one-line zingers, and she's going to go online and be like, look what I did, girlfriend, to low-IQ women.
[01:41:25.552 --> 01:41:28.593]  And she's going to use the women thing.
[01:41:28.973 --> 01:41:29.513]  I'm a woman.
[01:41:30.811 --> 01:41:31.372]  I should know.
[01:41:31.712 --> 01:41:33.674]  I totally agree.
[01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:42.461]  I don't know what she's on, but if you were a cop and pulled her over, she either looks super depressed and on depressants and alcohol part of the time, and other times she's glowing.
[01:41:42.481 --> 01:41:46.264]  I mean, at the DNC, she was lit up like a Christmas tree.
[01:41:46.304 --> 01:41:46.825]  Did you see that?
[01:41:48.266 --> 01:41:52.790]  Yes, and I was a cop, and most of my career was in the county jail.
[01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:55.492]  We had a super big facility.
[01:41:56.052 --> 01:41:59.175]  I dealt a lot with people on different types of drugs.
[01:42:00.081 --> 01:42:16.092]  And her actions, to me, show someone that is ADD, her mind bounces around, she's uncomfortable when she speaks, like she's not in her own skin, so she starts cackling and laughing at everything because she doesn't really know what to say.
[01:42:16.912 --> 01:42:26.118]  Her talking point, she is a Marxist, she's a communist, she feels that every person that
[01:42:28.015 --> 01:42:35.318]  Live the American Dream should have their money taken away from them that they worked hard for and distributed out to everyone.
[01:42:35.378 --> 01:42:39.260]  We have seen through generations that does not work.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:44.683]  When you do that, what you do is you give the government all the money.
[01:42:44.743 --> 01:42:49.065]  They have our $7 trillion budget already.
[01:42:49.245 --> 01:42:51.246]  We see what they are doing with that money.
[01:42:51.726 --> 01:42:56.268]  So if they get a hold of Elon Musk's money, they get a hold
[01:42:56.935 --> 01:43:06.243]  of Facebook's money, they get a hold of Amazon's money, we are screwed because they will have complete and utter control.
[01:43:06.283 --> 01:43:09.185]  We will be in lines begging for food.
[01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:11.267]  Perfectly said, Melissa.
[01:43:11.287 --> 01:43:11.547]  Thank you.
[01:43:11.567 --> 01:43:11.827]  Go ahead.
[01:43:11.867 --> 01:43:12.628]  Finish your point.
[01:43:13.389 --> 01:43:17.432]  She, she is that one.
[01:43:17.452 --> 01:43:19.534]  This, this is the big thing.
[01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:22.256]  One interview, one debate.
[01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.638]  She does this bullshit stump speech.
[01:43:25.655 --> 01:43:27.156]  That she reads over and over again.
[01:43:27.216 --> 01:43:28.157]  It's like Shazam.
[01:43:28.538 --> 01:43:31.660]  You have a 50% chance of being the President of the United States.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.762]  That's a good gig, if you can get it.
[01:43:34.302 --> 01:43:37.465]  Well, they want her because she's a dangerous puppet that's fully compromised.
[01:43:37.485 --> 01:43:38.366]  We'll do exactly what she told.
[01:43:38.406 --> 01:43:39.667]  Thank you so much for the call, Melissa.
[01:43:41.909 --> 01:43:47.594]  You know, I was thinking about, when I was driving into the office this morning, what I wanted to say first, and she just said it.
[01:43:49.275 --> 01:43:49.876]  And we know this.
[01:43:49.936 --> 01:43:53.619]  I mean, we can talk for hours about their statements, their facts, the Cloward and Pimmons, just one example.
[01:43:55.168 --> 01:44:00.592]  You can't take down an open, free, populist, even quasi-capitalist country.
[01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:04.195]  We're a crony capitalist country with a lot of socialism and communism mixed in.
[01:44:05.315 --> 01:44:07.877]  So some Americans live a capitalist life but have their money siphoned off.
[01:44:07.957 --> 01:44:11.420]  Others are either bureaucrats or government people and live off of it.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.521]  More and more people become lazy, don't want to work.
[01:44:13.561 --> 01:44:14.422]  That's all true too.
[01:44:15.262 --> 01:44:16.483]  So the workers just work harder.
[01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:22.107]  But the globalists do want to shut down society because they control the fiat currency.
[01:44:22.127 --> 01:44:23.849]  They can buy it all up because they want control.
[01:44:24.994 --> 01:44:29.036]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, but they want to collapse it.
[01:44:29.056 --> 01:44:34.938]  That's why they're bringing in the drugs and opening the borders and not prosecuting hardcore criminals, because that will bring down a society.
[01:44:35.578 --> 01:44:36.438]  That will give up hope.
[01:44:36.899 --> 01:44:40.660]  And you'll just get used to crime and homelessness and needles and feces.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.682]  I mean, just five years ago, Austin was super clean, hardly any homeless.
[01:44:46.142 --> 01:44:46.702]  They're everywhere.
[01:44:48.203 --> 01:44:48.663]  They're everywhere.
[01:44:49.363 --> 01:44:53.225]  And I get up a lot early in the morning, and I'm out on the road a lot by 6 a.m.
[01:44:54.963 --> 01:44:55.503]  Doing stuff.
[01:44:57.024 --> 01:45:03.425]  And... I mean, at least once a week, some psycho runs out in front of me.
[01:45:04.806 --> 01:45:07.306]  Central Austin, West Austin, South Austin.
[01:45:08.267 --> 01:45:12.128]  I've had homeless people three times the last couple weeks run out in front of me.
[01:45:12.608 --> 01:45:14.288]  One time with a baseball bat with a shirt off.
[01:45:14.548 --> 01:45:20.370]  Basically, he turned towards my car, and I slowed down, and he just looks at me like a zombie.
[01:45:20.590 --> 01:45:22.210]  With a baseball bat in his hand, drooling.
[01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:24.031]  And I'm just like... I mean, it was just so intense.
[01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:26.388]  Um, this morning.
[01:45:27.938 --> 01:45:32.201]  I'm driving, and I mean, I see this woman in Daisy Duke shorts.
[01:45:32.221 --> 01:45:33.722]  They're like panties.
[01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:36.144]  They're shorts, not panties, but they're thin panties.
[01:45:36.644 --> 01:45:39.426]  And I mean, she had an amazing figure from the back.
[01:45:39.946 --> 01:45:42.328]  Beautiful back, beautiful arms, short hair.
[01:45:42.988 --> 01:45:45.490]  And I drive by her, and I look at her face.
[01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:47.571]  She looks like an 80-year-old woman with crazy eyes.
[01:45:47.751 --> 01:45:50.273]  I mean, folks, it is Looney Tunes.
[01:45:50.333 --> 01:45:51.354]  I was talking to my buddy.
[01:45:52.374 --> 01:45:53.395]  We went on a hike Sunday.
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:01.722]  He's out in the middle of nowhere with his dog.
[01:46:03.343 --> 01:46:06.324]  And all of a sudden, this is on a hike and bike trail in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:06.584 --> 01:46:07.404]  He was telling me where she was at.
[01:46:07.424 --> 01:46:08.065]  This is the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:08.645 --> 01:46:18.249]  And this gorgeous woman with camo all over walks out 50 feet in front of him and looks at him and just walks naked into the woods.
[01:46:20.131 --> 01:46:23.412]  And he said, he's former, he's a Navy SEAL, former Navy SEAL.
[01:46:24.052 --> 01:46:37.276]  He, later, next time he was down there, decided to go back and look, and it's these giant homeless camps, but there's also normal people that go, and then he talked to them, and they said, oh, we come here and we party and take drugs on the weekend.
[01:46:37.776 --> 01:46:45.598]  So, I guess it's a thing with women, they go to like these crazy psycho camps and take hard drugs.
[01:46:46.899 --> 01:46:47.979]  This was early in the morning, he saw her.
[01:46:49.915 --> 01:46:51.876]  So, I mean, this is just crazy, folks.
[01:46:52.836 --> 01:46:53.637]  This is crazy.
[01:46:53.677 --> 01:46:55.277]  And he said she was gorgeous.
[01:46:58.579 --> 01:46:59.479]  I mean, what is that?
[01:47:02.161 --> 01:47:05.942]  A naked woman with camo paint all over in the middle of nowhere.
[01:47:05.982 --> 01:47:13.306]  I mean, where we were at was like a mile from a road, two miles from a road or houses with cliffs.
[01:47:13.866 --> 01:47:15.607]  And there's naked women running around out there.
[01:47:16.247 --> 01:47:17.908]  I remember like five, six years ago, I talked about it.
[01:47:19.611 --> 01:47:26.655]  I was down on Barton Creek in the middle of nowhere with my kids and the creek was running and I saw, and I knew what they were right away, Guatemalan Indians.
[01:47:26.856 --> 01:47:27.736]  They weren't even Hispanic.
[01:47:28.256 --> 01:47:32.019]  With their Guatemalan, you know, they wear little weaved hats and everything in there.
[01:47:32.219 --> 01:47:33.660]  They had 10 cans with string on it.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.241]  Fishing and catching fish with a fire.
[01:47:37.542 --> 01:47:39.423]  Guess they got here and have been sent somewhere since then.
[01:47:39.743 --> 01:47:44.967]  I mean, this is Guatemalan mountain Indians just, you know, just on the green belt.
[01:47:45.927 --> 01:47:46.888]  Total cuckoo world.
[01:47:48.766 --> 01:47:50.628]  Meanwhile, you tell people that, oh, that's not happening.
[01:47:51.068 --> 01:47:52.089]  The hell it isn't happening.
[01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:53.190]  I saw it with my own eyeballs.
[01:47:53.991 --> 01:47:56.794]  So civilization's falling apart, folks.
[01:47:57.654 --> 01:48:00.737]  Your kid may be playing video games all day and eating Hot Pockets and, you know, and riddling.
[01:48:00.837 --> 01:48:01.618]  Okay, that's bad enough.
[01:48:02.459 --> 01:48:05.522]  What if they're running around the woods naked on LSD or whatever?
[01:48:05.582 --> 01:48:06.322]  Whatever the hell they're on.
[01:48:06.342 --> 01:48:07.464]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:48:08.863 --> 01:48:11.985]  I didn't do a good job taking calls this hour, but your calls were all superlative.
[01:48:12.105 --> 01:48:18.150]  I'm going to take all the calls that are on the board and more, 877-789-2539, next hour.
[01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:24.094]  Remember, all this operation takes money, and I need money to fight the enemy, and we can get shut down easily.
[01:48:24.455 --> 01:48:27.136]  I know we get shut down, boy, there's going to be plenty of people wanting to give me money then.
[01:48:27.497 --> 01:48:28.457]  I'm not just saying this.
[01:48:28.578 --> 01:48:29.178]  I need your help.
[01:48:29.498 --> 01:48:31.380]  God keeps you right on E, whatever.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:33.982]  I was literally digging around for the two or
[01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:56.302]  I don't know.
[01:49:19.662 --> 01:49:25.083]  I'm now spending 10, 15, 20 percent of my time getting ready and that should show people the urgency in my mind.
[01:49:25.143 --> 01:49:27.684]  So the Satellite Phone Company is a great sponsor.
[01:49:27.704 --> 01:49:30.845]  Let's talk about some of the basics of what people need.
[01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:35.106]  There's some amazing new products they've got that you think are awesome.
[01:49:35.406 --> 01:49:39.607]  They've got the best satellite phones at the best prices with the best deals you're going to find.
[01:49:39.667 --> 01:49:40.387]  The good news is
[01:49:40.987 --> 01:49:43.068]  They're not a sponsor a lot of the time because they're sold out.
[01:49:43.249 --> 01:49:44.910]  They supply law enforcement, the military.
[01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:46.891]  I mean, they are the biggest company in the United States.
[01:49:46.911 --> 01:49:48.672]  You get the best deal of it because they buy the most.
[01:49:49.073 --> 01:49:51.514]  You see them sponsoring, you know, all the other big shows as well.
[01:49:51.534 --> 01:49:53.256]  You need to go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:49:53.276 --> 01:49:54.376]  That way we get some of the support.
[01:49:54.777 --> 01:49:55.817]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:49:55.837 --> 01:50:02.362]  Tell us about solar panels, solar charging systems, sat phones, and this other really cool secure encrypted phone.
[01:50:02.382 --> 01:50:03.423]  Tell us about these products.
[01:50:04.059 --> 01:50:07.522]  Well, the thing about it, you have to just look at what's happening.
[01:50:07.722 --> 01:50:13.366]  When they have 50 plus senators on the left getting sat phones in case there's a crisis, you should worry about it.
[01:50:13.806 --> 01:50:16.248]  If I'm going to keep people from uprising, I'm going to kill comms.
[01:50:16.288 --> 01:50:17.048]  It's the first thing you do.
[01:50:17.088 --> 01:50:18.249]  That's how you control chaos.
[01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:22.572]  I mean, every one of my family members has the sat phone, right?
[01:50:22.913 --> 01:50:30.278]  I make sure that all the sat phones, every quarter, everyone's phone on my team, on my family members, and then my emergency response vendors,
[01:50:30.878 --> 01:50:34.860]  Every one of their sat phones has the numbers listed in the phone, right?
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.181]  So, and then we do a drill.
[01:50:37.481 --> 01:50:38.962]  Every quarter we do a drill.
[01:50:39.022 --> 01:50:39.202]  Why?
[01:50:39.242 --> 01:50:42.103]  Because that allows me to remind myself to charge the phone.
[01:50:42.463 --> 01:50:50.126]  But this is part of my emergency response team, the security team, the guys are bringing the food and shelter in, the fuel, the power, everything, right?
[01:50:50.686 --> 01:50:53.688]  The other thing that I do is, I also have sat radios.
[01:50:53.708 --> 01:50:54.128]  So for me,
[01:50:54.888 --> 01:51:01.853]  And my team, especially when we're on the border or we're areas where it's off-grid, I'm making sure that I have my sat radios, right?
[01:51:03.294 --> 01:51:07.396]  Another great tool that I have is, of course, like, you know, simple, right?
[01:51:07.417 --> 01:51:12.780]  You got your power, your power bank, and then you have your actual charging, your solar charging panels, right?
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:18.824]  For areas that you're out in the desert, because what good is it if you have all your battery backups, but they're all dead, you know?
[01:51:21.118 --> 01:51:24.160]  Then I also carry a Baystate, which is an SOS.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.363]  You can drop it, send text messages with a backup phone.
[01:51:28.444 --> 01:51:32.867]  That works extremely well just for grid down, quick messaging.
[01:51:33.508 --> 01:51:37.671]  The other part of it, the security part of it, is I put the security team on these garments.
[01:51:37.691 --> 01:51:41.414]  These garments are also really, really good assets to have.
[01:51:42.254 --> 01:51:46.718]  And just for example, with Rescue the Republic, right, that's going to be September 29th in D.C.
[01:51:48.779 --> 01:51:58.981]  You got RJ speaking, you got Tulsi Gavars speaking, and you have the other big man speaking and a bunch of other people that I, that is all being announced as this stuff comes along.
[01:51:59.561 --> 01:52:05.822]  But all our security, the entire security team is using the Secure Phone.
[01:52:06.743 --> 01:52:13.524]  The Secure Phone is a Bidium phone and it is secure messaging phone to phone.
[01:52:15.015 --> 01:52:18.017]  If it ever were to get hacked, it scrubs all the messages from it.
[01:52:18.037 --> 01:52:19.918]  That phone completely shuts down.
[01:52:19.938 --> 01:52:21.159]  Everything clears off of it.
[01:52:21.799 --> 01:52:22.900]  It's water resistant.
[01:52:24.241 --> 01:52:26.382]  It prevents tracking, right?
[01:52:26.822 --> 01:52:31.585]  And this phone, to me, it's what NATO's using right now.
[01:52:32.125 --> 01:52:33.266]  So the commanders are using it.
[01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:35.327]  It's at the very, very top of it.
[01:52:35.427 --> 01:52:39.250]  It's something that I feel is going to be key
[01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:45.712]  Not just in the public sector, but in the private sector when it comes to family members.
[01:52:46.333 --> 01:52:51.615]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:53:45.477 --> 01:53:56.961]  If it keeps on raining, the levee's gonna break When the levee breaks, you have no place to stay Going down, going down now
[01:54:08.903 --> 01:54:10.084]  Hard to turn this music off.
[01:54:10.904 --> 01:54:14.406]  This is probably the best Led Zeppelin song there is.
[01:54:14.506 --> 01:54:20.508]  Play a little bit of it while we watch the Alamo.
[01:54:20.528 --> 01:54:23.430]  Robert Plant lived in Austin for 10 years.
[01:54:32.063 --> 01:54:37.767]  He lived four doors down from my last office.
[01:54:38.207 --> 01:54:44.532]  The whole time he was there, I didn't know he was there.
[01:54:44.672 --> 01:54:48.274]  He had a former church decommissioned, desanctified church he lived in.
[01:54:49.235 --> 01:54:52.097]  Then he moved out to Lake Travis.
[01:54:52.177 --> 01:54:52.778]  I met him later.
[01:54:53.798 --> 01:54:55.199]  But I had no idea he lived right there.
[01:54:57.313 --> 01:54:59.374]  That's how perception works, you see.
[01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:06.096]  Average person doesn't know there's probably 800,000, they admit, 325,000 kidnapped kids in America under Kamala.
[01:55:06.617 --> 01:55:08.237]  Because they're not right in front of you, you don't care.
[01:55:08.257 --> 01:55:11.819]  They're locked up in Walmarts, being used for slave labor, you name it.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:14.820]  Man, that song's good.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.761]  Best part's coming up.
[01:55:39.113 --> 01:55:41.595]  I bet this song's never been put to the straight Alamo.
[01:55:41.915 --> 01:55:43.336]  What version of the Alamo is this?
[01:55:43.356 --> 01:55:45.678]  I don't see John Wayne running around.
[01:55:45.718 --> 01:55:54.665]  What version is this?
[01:55:54.685 --> 01:55:55.746]  Oh, this is John Wayne's Alamo.
[01:55:57.176 --> 01:55:59.257]  I shot this out in the hill country outside Austin.
[01:56:00.558 --> 01:56:02.358]  I met his son once, they live out there.
[01:56:02.398 --> 01:56:04.960]  John Wayne secretly lived outside Austin for a long time.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.461]  We lived in different places, but he had a big ranch out there.
[01:56:09.922 --> 01:56:12.003]  Jimmy Vaughn, my old buddy, lives out right by his old ranch.
[01:56:13.143 --> 01:56:13.884]  Blanco County.
[01:56:15.564 --> 01:56:18.526]  Keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[01:56:19.437 --> 01:56:22.559]  When the levee breaks, have no place to stay.
[01:56:23.019 --> 01:56:25.341]  Going down, going down to Chicago.
[01:56:25.361 --> 01:56:29.043]  A lot of stations don't carry this first five, that's why I went ahead and pontificated.
[01:56:29.623 --> 01:56:32.625]  Gave me a little music break, because man, this news is so hardcore.
[01:56:33.365 --> 01:56:34.726]  And I'll be completely honest with you.
[01:56:34.746 --> 01:56:39.889]  A lot of stuff doesn't get me butterflies.
[01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:45.933]  But... RFK endorsing Trump, which I broke and told you.
[01:56:46.889 --> 01:56:49.231]  But there was a weird chance that it was some weird setup.
[01:56:49.271 --> 01:56:53.755]  I didn't think RFK was like that, but... I mean, this came from very high up in the campaign.
[01:56:53.795 --> 01:56:54.355]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:56:54.395 --> 01:56:55.256]  Like, real high up.
[01:56:56.457 --> 01:57:00.740]  And... Then, of course, he endorsed him like I said he would.
[01:57:01.521 --> 01:57:04.724]  And I had butterflies about that, because he backed it up 45 minutes and made us wait.
[01:57:04.764 --> 01:57:06.005]  And it's the same thing for tonight.
[01:57:08.573 --> 01:57:11.376]  It is going to be crazy because she's already destroyed.
[01:57:11.396 --> 01:57:13.518]  She's already really far behind in all the real polls.
[01:57:13.739 --> 01:57:23.709]  And if she falls on her face, I mean, she went down, they admitted three or four or five points in some of the polls after the CNN debacle, where she sits way down in her chair and can barely talk.
[01:57:23.729 --> 01:57:25.972]  I can't even make the face.
[01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:28.835]  Like she's all distraught.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:39.302]  So you either get the scared, drunk Xanax Kamala, or you get the methamphetamine Adderall Exocine Kamala.
[01:57:40.163 --> 01:57:41.643]  And I don't know what we're gonna get tonight.
[01:57:43.544 --> 01:57:47.585]  And I agree with the caller earlier, she admittedly has anxiety issues, Kamala.
[01:57:48.045 --> 01:57:49.345]  So she does that head-bobbing thing.
[01:57:49.365 --> 01:57:52.846]  And Tim Walz does that.
[01:58:26.027 --> 01:58:28.127]  The Patriots based on a composite of three different men.
[01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:29.528]  This actually happened.
[01:58:31.268 --> 01:58:34.449]  Swamp Fox himself probably killed over 200 British soldiers.
[01:58:34.469 --> 01:58:38.150]  Because he'd been a redcoat in the French and Indian War.
[01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:39.130]  War hero.
[01:58:42.531 --> 01:58:43.611]  That's where our country comes from.
[01:58:43.631 --> 01:58:45.471]  Defeating the greatest empire in the world at the time.
[01:58:47.872 --> 01:58:48.772]  We'll defeat the globalists.
[01:58:50.712 --> 01:58:55.798]  Whether there's a civil war or they want black and white killing each other, that's not what we should do.
[01:58:55.818 --> 01:59:01.324]  We need to remove the criminals from power, the actual heads of the operations.
[01:59:02.686 --> 01:59:06.210]  It's called nonviolent, loving, political decapitation.
[01:59:26.749 --> 01:59:27.970]  Who wanna fix this politically?
[01:59:28.731 --> 01:59:32.013]  But we gotta fight in the information war like it's a physical fight for our lives.
[01:59:33.274 --> 01:59:36.437]  They already hit us with a bioweapon, killed 35 million people with the shots, and we're going.
[01:59:36.457 --> 01:59:37.958]  It's in the game, people.
[01:59:41.981 --> 01:59:45.404]  Alright, let's go right back to your phone calls as we build up to the debate tonight, now.
[01:59:46.285 --> 01:59:50.208]  Only 6 hours and 52 minutes.
[01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:54.312]  Crystal in Tennessee, thanks for calling, thanks for holding.
[01:59:54.332 --> 01:59:54.572]  Go ahead.
[01:59:55.714 --> 01:59:57.374]  Hey Alex, so good to be on here with you.
[01:59:57.394 --> 01:59:58.435]  I'm going to be really quick.
[01:59:58.475 --> 02:00:02.476]  I've got like three quick observations and I have a question I want to ask you.
[02:00:02.536 --> 02:00:03.216]  I'm an attorney.
[02:00:03.916 --> 02:00:07.817]  I've worked only with the poorest of the poor, but I'm in Memphis, which is extremely liberal.
[02:00:08.197 --> 02:00:11.498]  You get blackballed by the affluent people if you say you're pro-Trump.
[02:00:11.538 --> 02:00:12.638]  I mean, it's bizarre.
[02:00:12.678 --> 02:00:17.400]  Well, real quick, I want to say something about the trans thing, and this does have to do with the election.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:22.041]  I volunteered after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in like a
[02:00:22.634 --> 02:00:25.396]  Devastated school, helping all the animals.
[02:00:25.416 --> 02:00:26.357]  I was single at the time.
[02:00:26.397 --> 02:00:28.178]  I did not get married until my early 40s.
[02:00:28.518 --> 02:00:29.919]  Been single that whole time.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.641]  I went down there to help the animals, bleeding hard.
[02:00:33.262 --> 02:00:36.544]  I had been accepted into the Marine Corps, but at the time I decided not to go.
[02:00:37.345 --> 02:00:39.146]  But I was in the best shape of my life.
[02:00:39.626 --> 02:00:40.667]  I was on 5'4".
[02:00:40.787 --> 02:00:45.651]  I could run 3 miles in 21 minutes, and I could do pull-ups, which are next to impossible for women.
[02:00:46.251 --> 02:00:51.595]  When I was down there, I was getting a huge pit bull that was firmly out of its cage, and I could not control it.
[02:00:52.057 --> 02:00:54.998]  And it was gonna get away and run off, which is, you know, you can't let happen.
[02:00:55.558 --> 02:00:59.179]  This scrawny, chain-smoking kid.
[02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:00.219]  Well, he wasn't a kid.
[02:01:00.239 --> 02:01:01.299]  He was my age or older.
[02:01:01.319 --> 02:01:03.700]  90-pound male.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.820]  Again, chain-smoking.
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:06.800]  I'm in the best shape of my life as a female.
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:07.760]  He walked up.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.841]  He wasn't trying to impress me.
[02:01:08.941 --> 02:01:10.581]  You gotta understand what this was like down there.
[02:01:10.641 --> 02:01:11.921]  He was not trying to impress me.
[02:01:12.201 --> 02:01:13.282]  He saw I was in trouble.
[02:01:14.142 --> 02:01:15.722]  I'm in the best shape of my life.
[02:01:15.802 --> 02:01:18.443]  He walks up and manhandles the massive pit bull.
[02:01:18.603 --> 02:01:19.863]  I couldn't get a control on it.
[02:01:20.461 --> 02:01:23.363]  To save my life, and I was strong for a female in my arms.
[02:01:24.064 --> 02:01:30.469]  You as an alpha male, and all the alpha males and other men listening to this show, simply do not understand.
[02:01:30.749 --> 02:01:31.970]  We need you to fight for us.
[02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:38.615]  On a cellular, visceral level, from the moment I had consciousness, I knew I was weaker than a man.
[02:01:39.096 --> 02:01:39.516]  I'm weak.
[02:01:39.936 --> 02:01:45.841]  In the best shape of my life, a 70-year-old man can beat my ass, who's not in shape, because I'm female.
[02:01:46.545 --> 02:01:54.673]  This idea that men can then compete with us is beyond offensive and we need you men to fight because you know you're strong.
[02:01:55.154 --> 02:01:56.055]  I know I'm weak.
[02:01:56.555 --> 02:01:59.278]  This idea that a man can come is appalling.
[02:01:59.759 --> 02:02:01.560]  This segues into Trump.
[02:02:02.041 --> 02:02:04.664]  Trump is the president for single women.
[02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:09.689]  I'm telling you, 10 years in criminal defense, 2 years working in housing law,
[02:02:10.285 --> 02:02:17.710]  I saw the devastation that single women, who are often elderly and who are childless, so they say he hates single childless women.
[02:02:17.970 --> 02:02:19.291]  No, the Democrats hate them.
[02:02:19.571 --> 02:02:30.657]  Because with the devastation of the police, the legalization of prostitution, the legalization of drugs, I have elderly women that would call in and say there's weed coming in my house, there's gangs everywhere.
[02:02:31.398 --> 02:02:36.361]  Trump's law and order trickles down and it emboldens communities to care about law and order.
[02:02:36.661 --> 02:02:39.803]  Since the Democrats have been in power, cities have deteriorated.
[02:02:40.231 --> 02:02:46.335]  He needs to make sure and hammer that he is the president of law and order, which helps- Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:46.355 --> 02:02:48.077]  Look, Gloria Steinem worked for the CIA.
[02:02:48.117 --> 02:02:48.937]  That's declassified.
[02:02:48.957 --> 02:02:55.342]  This whole thing was to get women in the workforce so that the state could control the children to then break down the family and destroy society.
[02:02:55.842 --> 02:02:59.905]  Paul Ehrlich, all of them are on record on TV in the 70s and 80s and 90s on 60 Minutes.
[02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:02.695]  Admitting this.
[02:03:02.735 --> 02:03:04.317]  We played the clips, we can play them again.
[02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:05.558]  This is all a plan.
[02:03:05.618 --> 02:03:06.820]  It's not to empower women.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:09.142]  And women now, more than ever, are desperate.
[02:03:09.182 --> 02:03:09.923]  They're unhappy.
[02:03:09.943 --> 02:03:16.150]  In Europe and in the U.S., they tell them, we'll get into prostitution as a second job.
[02:03:16.170 --> 02:03:18.473]  And now that's how you empower yourself.
[02:03:18.513 --> 02:03:19.895]  The women don't want that on average.
[02:03:20.375 --> 02:03:21.456]  And so this is all going on.
[02:03:21.476 --> 02:03:22.297]  And look at this today.
[02:03:23.098 --> 02:03:26.503]  The United Nations agency declares war on gender language.
[02:03:27.183 --> 02:03:33.111]  Male and female in Canada isn't even on the forms for parents at schools for the kids.
[02:03:33.652 --> 02:03:34.613]  You can't be a man or woman.
[02:03:34.633 --> 02:03:35.654]  That hurts males' feelings.
[02:03:35.955 --> 02:03:37.457]  They're attacking our biology.
[02:03:37.477 --> 02:03:37.957]  Here's another one.
[02:03:38.858 --> 02:03:46.823]  Minor girls labeled transphobic after speaking out against LGBTQAAP2S plus boys using their locker room.
[02:03:46.843 --> 02:03:49.505]  I had articles yesterday at public schools all over the place.
[02:03:49.845 --> 02:03:55.689]  They're putting female coaches in the boys' locker rooms, instructing them while they're in the showers.
[02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:58.811]  I mean, I didn't particularly like it, you know, in football or whatever.
[02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:00.312]  We're good to go.
[02:04:21.032 --> 02:04:21.732]  We're good.
[02:04:41.477 --> 02:04:41.897]  I don't know.
[02:05:02.125 --> 02:05:15.181]  Again, it's a litmus test to see how much craziness we will accept, so we'll accept human clones, animal-human clones, all of this dehumanization to get us not to believe in ourselves, and that's what Kamala Harris is for, and I totally agree he should bring that up.
[02:05:16.022 --> 02:05:17.423]  Hey, can I ask you a question, Alex?
[02:05:17.563 --> 02:05:17.784]  Yes.
[02:05:18.725 --> 02:05:18.905]  Okay.
[02:05:19.971 --> 02:05:20.772]  One quick prediction.
[02:05:20.912 --> 02:05:22.733]  I don't think Kamala's going to go the distance.
[02:05:22.913 --> 02:05:24.093]  I've thought about this a lot.
[02:05:24.173 --> 02:05:27.615]  I think she is so fucking stupid, and they all know she's stupid and she's awful.
[02:05:27.695 --> 02:05:30.436]  I think that they're going to take the L, let Trump win.
[02:05:30.917 --> 02:05:31.237]  I hope.
[02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:33.118]  And then, because I think Newsom wants to win in 28.
[02:05:33.278 --> 02:05:34.398]  It's going to be wide open in 28.
[02:05:34.458 --> 02:05:37.640]  They're going to be stuck with that idiot for eight years if she wins.
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:41.542]  But listen, Alex, this is really what I wanted to ask you, because I know you have a lot of sources.
[02:05:42.102 --> 02:05:43.783]  OK, we saw them shoot Trump.
[02:05:46.084 --> 02:05:47.145]  Listen, and I happened to watch it.
[02:05:47.185 --> 02:05:47.585]  I caught it.
[02:05:48.334 --> 02:05:53.499]  I mean, you are constantly giving us intel that you hear that is so on point.
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:56.622]  You get it before we all do, and then it comes out and it's news.
[02:05:57.143 --> 02:06:11.677]  So here's my question that I think a lot of people have, and it's kind of hard to tease out, but if they can shoot Trump, if they can do everything that they have done to him, the deep state, the evil, the Klaus Schwab, Soros, all of this really scary crap.
[02:06:12.774 --> 02:06:16.436]  Okay, and we know that the election may come down to swing states.
[02:06:16.797 --> 02:06:18.738]  What are you hearing, if anything?
[02:06:18.758 --> 02:06:22.480]  Because in the back of my mind, Alex, I'm going, they've already shot him.
[02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:24.361]  We've got this evil cabal.
[02:06:24.701 --> 02:06:25.582]  There's no way.
[02:06:25.642 --> 02:06:29.104]  If it only comes down to a few votes in swing states,
[02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:31.131]  We don't have a prayer.
[02:06:31.292 --> 02:06:32.313]  They're in charge.
[02:06:32.793 --> 02:06:43.403]  Can you talk me down from the ledge and explain why even with all those things they have going in their favor, we even have a prayer of him getting in?
[02:06:43.423 --> 02:06:47.567]  And that's the end of my question, but I'd love your thoughts on that because I'm so upset.
[02:06:47.767 --> 02:06:51.431]  I feel like they've already got it in the bag because they're going to cheat.
[02:06:51.791 --> 02:06:54.834]  If they can kill him, essentially, they just happen to miss.
[02:06:55.737 --> 02:06:58.438]  Why would we think they're going to let him win a fair election?
[02:06:58.778 --> 02:06:59.318]  And that's it.
[02:06:59.418 --> 02:07:00.759]  And I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:01.659]  Thank you, Crystal.
[02:07:02.119 --> 02:07:02.480]  Pleasure.
[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:04.560]  I think you answered the question.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:06.841]  I mean, I've talked about this a lot until people's ears bleed.
[02:07:08.682 --> 02:07:10.323]  They tried to kill him on July 13.
[02:07:10.903 --> 02:07:12.403]  Deep State takes an hour to roll the evidence.
[02:07:12.864 --> 02:07:13.424]  100% stand down.
[02:07:13.444 --> 02:07:14.604]  Secret Service didn't shoot the shooter.
[02:07:15.645 --> 02:07:16.365]  Local cops did.
[02:07:16.405 --> 02:07:18.706]  The cops are like pointing at him, get him, get him, waiting for the orders.
[02:07:18.726 --> 02:07:19.066]  They shouldn't.
[02:07:19.086 --> 02:07:21.227]  They should have just shot him themselves, which they later did.
[02:07:22.349 --> 02:07:23.549]  They have lied at every level.
[02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.550]  They did it.
[02:07:24.590 --> 02:07:25.630]  They've said they want him dead.
[02:07:27.371 --> 02:07:28.211]  There was a stand down.
[02:07:28.351 --> 02:07:30.532]  And then when they didn't kill him, made him even more popular.
[02:07:30.652 --> 02:07:33.292]  So now they are in total panic mode.
[02:07:33.372 --> 02:07:35.633]  And so they will try to kill him again.
[02:07:36.593 --> 02:07:40.315]  And so that's why people are like, oh, that happened 50 something days ago.
[02:07:40.335 --> 02:07:41.415]  That's ancient news.
[02:07:41.615 --> 02:07:42.195]  No, it's not.
[02:07:42.335 --> 02:07:43.976]  It's the news of today and tomorrow.
[02:07:44.892 --> 02:07:46.313]  So I don't know what else I'm supposed to say.
[02:07:46.353 --> 02:07:50.014]  They can blow his plane up, say Iranians shot it down, truck bomb him, say the Iranians did it.
[02:07:50.054 --> 02:07:51.574]  I said that before they'd said the Iranians would.
[02:07:51.594 --> 02:07:52.675]  I thought, who would they blame?
[02:07:52.695 --> 02:07:56.116]  Well, they want to attack Iran and yeah, they're gonna blame Iran.
[02:07:56.136 --> 02:08:01.158]  And then days later, they started doing it by the 16th of July, three days after.
[02:08:01.358 --> 02:08:02.778]  I said it a day after.
[02:08:04.059 --> 02:08:05.519]  So it's not hard.
[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:08.641]  I mean, they're smart.
[02:08:08.661 --> 02:08:12.302]  They'll try to poison him so that they can, oh, he just had a heart attack.
[02:08:14.190 --> 02:08:17.153]  So Trump's taking a lot of precautions, I can tell you that.
[02:08:18.735 --> 02:08:23.601]  And so he's doing a good job.
[02:08:23.941 --> 02:08:24.361]  Pray for him.
[02:08:25.222 --> 02:08:26.524]  Our God can override them.
[02:08:26.704 --> 02:08:28.966]  If we pray and take action, God will take us the rest of the way.
[02:08:29.327 --> 02:08:30.348]  And I believe Trump is protected.
[02:08:30.368 --> 02:08:30.808]  I don't believe it.
[02:08:30.849 --> 02:08:31.790]  We saw that on the 13th.
[02:08:33.532 --> 02:08:35.494]  Turns his head the last minute.
[02:08:38.467 --> 02:08:39.388]  Or this way.
[02:08:40.108 --> 02:08:41.509]  So, it's amazing.
[02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:44.230]  Nick in California, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[02:08:46.111 --> 02:08:51.214]  Yeah, so, American politics is just a total personality cult.
[02:08:53.735 --> 02:09:01.359]  It's been pulled away from any kind of basis in scientific confirmability or hard science.
[02:09:01.959 --> 02:09:06.942]  And it's become, like both sides, there's two different, so if a billionaire globalist
[02:09:07.423 --> 02:09:07.563]  What's
[02:09:39.899 --> 02:09:42.200]  I agree with you overall.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:44.400]  Let me have an overhead shot for TV viewers.
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:46.460]  I'm going to give you a very primitive graph here.
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:48.781]  This is not scientific, but it's just a dead reckoning.
[02:09:50.221 --> 02:09:54.502]  Let's say in a presidential election in general, an average one about 65% vote.
[02:09:54.522 --> 02:09:56.662]  This is going to be a huge turnout.
[02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.143]  I would guess that around 70% vote.
[02:09:58.263 --> 02:09:58.403]  Okay.
[02:09:59.803 --> 02:10:01.803]  So, so, so if you've got 70% voting,
[02:10:07.603 --> 02:10:11.565]  And there's other people that are undecided or independents or just have given up or don't care.
[02:10:11.985 --> 02:10:12.745]  They're the 30%.
[02:10:13.285 --> 02:10:14.606]  Usually in a midterm, you get 40 to 50%.
[02:10:14.646 --> 02:10:17.827]  So in a midterm, you know, it's half.
[02:10:17.847 --> 02:10:20.848]  But in a general election, general election, it's 70%.
[02:10:22.029 --> 02:10:29.391]  Now, out of the 70% that vote, and that's, you know, all this area, they claim
[02:10:31.653 --> 02:10:33.735]  That generally about 57% are Democrats.
[02:10:33.755 --> 02:10:35.096]  That's an old number, it's not accurate.
[02:10:35.116 --> 02:10:36.197]  There's been a political realignment.
[02:10:36.217 --> 02:10:37.698]  And then the Republicans are the junior party.
[02:10:37.939 --> 02:10:39.320]  So they always oversample in polls.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:49.869]  But looking at this, it's true that at least 25% of people that do vote do it off of optics.
[02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:56.375]  So to say that it's all just a beauty pageant, how good does the tie look, and how good do they talk, and how many zingers they have, about
[02:11:00.692 --> 02:11:06.338]  A third, or 25% right under that, of the people that vote do it off what you're saying.
[02:11:07.339 --> 02:11:18.592]  There is a large portion that actually go off policy and so I would say with Trump, I mean we fight him with memes of kittens and ducks and that's all trying to reach low information voters and make a joke out of it.
[02:11:18.972 --> 02:11:20.394]  So it's true that we do target
[02:11:21.658 --> 02:11:29.305]  And I mean, I do this myself, I don't really do it consciously, but I mean, we put out goofy stuff that dumbos like, but I also like, because I'm kind of a dumbo in one part of my show.
[02:11:29.705 --> 02:11:42.536]  But then mainly we're all about statistics and facts, like Kamala wants a 75% unrealized capital gains tax, that'll kill the economy, like eating a pound of cyanide will kill a person, or even a tenth of an ounce, or a thimble full, or a gram of it.
[02:11:43.377 --> 02:11:46.201]  So, or price controls will wreck the economy.
[02:11:47.362 --> 02:11:57.976]  So yeah, but I mean, I'm all about the facts, but it is true that elections are decided by that minority that's a large minority of people that just go off how the suit looks.
[02:11:57.996 --> 02:11:59.038]  So what do we do about that?
[02:12:00.248 --> 02:12:02.390]  Yeah, so that happens either way.
[02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:19.066]  If the quote-unquote politicians were very hard science-based and knew about economics, knew about how to run a successful business, were expected to fulfill on the campaign promises that they make, that effect that you're talking about would still happen, right?
[02:12:19.086 --> 02:12:24.591]  But what happens is if you only do hard facts and the other side is targeting that
[02:12:25.595 --> 02:12:27.355]  Yeah, yeah, that's definitely there.
[02:12:27.395 --> 02:12:28.396]  But what we're talking about is...
[02:12:45.743 --> 02:12:46.183]  No, no.
[02:12:46.283 --> 02:12:47.024]  I'm totally with that.
[02:12:47.064 --> 02:12:54.989]  But what we're looking at is a system where... I mean, I'll do hours of a show and five minutes of screaming and yelling and tearing my shirt off, too.
[02:12:55.409 --> 02:12:56.550]  And I do it because I like to do it.
[02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:57.751]  It just so happens that works.
[02:12:57.811 --> 02:13:01.353]  But, I mean, it's that... I mean, I don't think it's bad to have some pageantry.
[02:13:01.393 --> 02:13:02.034]  But here's my point.
[02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:02.674]  What are you getting at?
[02:13:03.935 --> 02:13:10.199]  What I'm getting at is that this entire system is... You've got lobbying, you've got pastry, you've got campaign finance.
[02:13:10.774 --> 02:13:21.158]  Trump even came out, and one of the things that I admire about Trump so much is he came out and called out that entire swamp system where he was saying, look, I'm only here because, you know, that's how the system works.
[02:13:21.278 --> 02:13:21.718]  It's corrupt.
[02:13:21.758 --> 02:13:22.818]  He did it in 2016.
[02:13:22.878 --> 02:13:24.259]  He needs to do more of that.
[02:13:25.019 --> 02:13:25.539]  I love that.
[02:13:25.699 --> 02:13:26.679]  I absolutely love that.
[02:13:26.699 --> 02:13:27.120]  Very refreshing.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.441]  Because I took political science at an accredited, you know, community college.
[02:13:32.032 --> 02:13:34.813]  And you learn all about the lobbying, K Street.
[02:13:34.913 --> 02:13:42.295]  But that's why they don't like him because the lobbying goes way down under him because he doesn't let his surrogates do that.
[02:13:42.315 --> 02:13:43.575]  If he catches them, they get fired.
[02:13:43.936 --> 02:13:45.276]  Trump does what he wants.
[02:13:45.416 --> 02:13:48.497]  You don't go give him something and you get something with Trump.
[02:13:50.976 --> 02:13:56.038]  And what he wants is what he says that he wants, and that is a successful country.
[02:13:57.478 --> 02:13:59.139]  It's money in people's bank accounts.
[02:13:59.479 --> 02:14:04.120]  Like, there's been no shortage of politicians who could promise to send a check.
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:04.840]  Now, listen, listen.
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:05.641]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:14:05.661 --> 02:14:07.961]  You're a well-spoken guy, Nick, and I agree with everything you're saying.
[02:14:08.642 --> 02:14:11.262]  I think we kind of know this, so what do you think about the debate tonight?
[02:14:12.863 --> 02:14:18.725]  With that debate tonight, it's kind of a thing that's already won in a way and kind of lost in another way.
[02:14:19.844 --> 02:14:19.924]  Yeah.
[02:14:35.743 --> 02:14:38.685]  A nuke to a gunfight, you know, he's a completely different animal.
[02:14:38.705 --> 02:14:42.607]  Yeah, but he has to do that to override all the election fraud, and I agree with you, thanks for the call.
[02:14:43.228 --> 02:14:51.573]  No, I mean, look, when you get The Rock and Elton John coming out and saying Trump's a wonderful person, they've always liked him, and a bunch of others do it, they can see the writing on the wall.
[02:14:52.093 --> 02:14:53.174]  That's why they're gonna try to kill him.
[02:14:53.674 --> 02:14:57.017]  So everybody keeps saying, hey, Trump's got it, hey, yeah, no he doesn't!
[02:14:59.138 --> 02:15:00.939]  And we're 55 days out, or 54.
[02:15:00.999 --> 02:15:02.180]  How many days are we out from the election, guys?
[02:15:03.456 --> 02:15:04.096]  We'll put it on screen.
[02:15:04.897 --> 02:15:07.519]  I mean, this is just wild time to be alive.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:10.781]  And I don't want to make this come true.
[02:15:11.741 --> 02:15:15.644]  Like I told you months before, they're gonna try to kill Trump imminently.
[02:15:15.844 --> 02:15:16.244]  55 days out.
[02:15:17.985 --> 02:15:26.071]  It's their only move or a giant cyber attack that they blame on Trump supporters, which I've just, without even looking, and when I say that, it means they're pushing it hard in the news.
[02:15:26.771 --> 02:15:30.974]  Oh, the right-wing white supremacists are gonna try to knock the power out, but the FBI is gonna stop them.
[02:15:31.854 --> 02:15:35.276]  They're pre-programming that because they're thinking about doing it.
[02:15:38.177 --> 02:15:40.379]  Brennan in North Carolina.
[02:15:40.419 --> 02:15:41.399]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:15:41.439 --> 02:15:41.719]  Go ahead.
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:44.001]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:15:44.221 --> 02:15:45.141]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:15:45.421 --> 02:15:54.687]  I just wanted to, yes sir, I wanted to say something to maybe kind of unify everyone listening on immigration and maybe an idea for Trump now and moving forward.
[02:15:54.707 --> 02:15:56.628]  So I'm a 28-year-old farmer.
[02:15:56.688 --> 02:16:00.790]  I've done construction mostly since college and because of the type of construction I do,
[02:16:01.451 --> 02:16:10.095]  I've been working with mostly illegal Hispanics and, you know, historically a lot of the people are hardworking and they love family and they love God.
[02:16:10.956 --> 02:16:17.619]  And I've even had Guatemalan guys say that they saw ads with Obama saying, come here, we want you, get a job, get citizenship.
[02:16:17.679 --> 02:16:18.640]  That didn't work out for them.
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:27.044]  But the slavery system that's over the migrants now and the system, the neo-feudal system that's over us as well.
[02:16:27.848 --> 02:16:30.789]  has been perfected and it does not stop at the border.
[02:16:31.129 --> 02:16:39.752]  There are, there's child slave labor going on, you know, to the liberals that want to defend the downtrodden and don't think that child slavery is going on.
[02:16:39.832 --> 02:16:48.055]  Go find a tobacco farm on a Saturday and you'll see, see who's suckering and picking the suckers off the tobacco.
[02:16:48.415 --> 02:16:55.497]  They need a small person, a very small person to get in there and you're going to find these children have nicotine poisoning and
[02:16:56.317 --> 02:16:57.578]  They're just, it's just horrible.
[02:16:57.678 --> 02:17:11.505]  And then to the conservatives, um, if you ever go by construction sites and you see, you know, not all the time, but you see a crew chief and a couple of guys with nice trucks and then 20 or 30 guys wearing this, that, and whatever, don't speak a lick of English.
[02:17:11.905 --> 02:17:13.486]  That's a Blanquero operation.
[02:17:13.506 --> 02:17:14.166]  That's bleaching.
[02:17:14.446 --> 02:17:15.987]  It's money laundering for the cartel.
[02:17:16.387 --> 02:17:20.369]  When the cartel funnels people across the border with the coyotes,
[02:17:21.095 --> 02:17:21.955]  It doesn't stop there.
[02:17:21.996 --> 02:17:25.397]  They have tools, travel, lodging, routes.
[02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:31.520]  They control them for at least a decade and then they hand them over to the Democrats and their immigration lawyers who take a big cut of their money.
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:31.841]  Exactly.
[02:17:31.881 --> 02:17:33.061]  It's a permanent underclass.
[02:17:34.202 --> 02:17:35.082]  Yes, it is a permanent underclass.
[02:17:35.102 --> 02:17:37.944]  Yeah, we're not bringing them here to get them out of the tyranny.
[02:17:38.504 --> 02:17:44.988]  And you're right, the Democrats, even under Biden, they run ads and the UN runs ads, come El Norte, they get them here and they exploit the hell out of them.
[02:17:46.388 --> 02:17:46.929]  Absolutely.
[02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:48.349]  I mean, I've seen so much of that.
[02:17:48.369 --> 02:17:49.690]  And then one thing they do is because
[02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.503]  Then they're compromised.
[02:17:51.563 --> 02:17:52.783]  It's a lot like our politicians.
[02:17:53.104 --> 02:17:56.345]  Once they're dirty, they have them hold money, hold guns.
[02:17:56.425 --> 02:17:58.086]  I've seen pictures of the guns.
[02:17:58.426 --> 02:18:01.168]  They hold drugs because they're illegal.
[02:18:01.228 --> 02:18:04.710]  The fact that people think that illegal immigrants
[02:18:05.225 --> 02:18:07.306]  They're just going to round them up and it's going to go peacefully.
[02:18:07.346 --> 02:18:08.367]  They have guns!
[02:18:08.707 --> 02:18:11.889]  And they're confused about the messaging coming from- By the way, let me interrupt you.
[02:18:12.009 --> 02:18:17.432]  I started getting told three years ago that the ATF was selling gun stores to let illegals buy guns.
[02:18:17.512 --> 02:18:27.517]  And then a federal judge ruled last year, Obama judge appointed, saying, yes, illegals have a right to buy guns, sell guns, use guns, carry guns.
[02:18:28.097 --> 02:18:30.198]  And the same judge says citizens should be able to own them.
[02:18:30.238 --> 02:18:31.239]  Yes, they're arming them.
[02:18:32.403 --> 02:18:35.386]  Yeah, I mean, they're 5-10% of our population now.
[02:18:35.906 --> 02:18:37.668]  They need these black markets.
[02:18:37.928 --> 02:18:39.590]  Oh, they're way over 10%, brother.
[02:18:40.170 --> 02:18:40.771]  Are you kidding?
[02:18:41.291 --> 02:18:43.313]  They brought in $25 million in the last three and a half years.
[02:18:43.553 --> 02:18:44.734]  It's $50 million in the last 15.
[02:18:46.753 --> 02:18:47.954]  That wouldn't surprise me at all.
[02:18:47.994 --> 02:18:53.178]  I mean, people have no idea how... Brother, you're out in beautiful North Carolina in a rural area.
[02:18:53.498 --> 02:18:54.438]  Come to a city, buddy.
[02:18:54.578 --> 02:18:55.059]  Go anywhere.
[02:18:55.519 --> 02:18:59.542]  Arkansas, Illinois, Texas, California, New Mexico.
[02:18:59.902 --> 02:19:02.084]  We got illegal aliens crawling out of our ass.
[02:19:02.124 --> 02:19:03.404]  And let me tell you, you're right.
[02:19:03.465 --> 02:19:06.286]  The Mexicans, on average, are hard-working, good people.
[02:19:06.767 --> 02:19:08.248]  But they do what the Democrats tell them.
[02:19:08.548 --> 02:19:11.150]  Once they become citizens and get away from them, they start voting Republican.
[02:19:11.370 --> 02:19:13.351]  But Republican leadership is part of the problem, too.
[02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:14.192]  Trump's different.
[02:19:14.592 --> 02:19:15.273]  But let me tell you,
[02:19:16.107 --> 02:19:26.275]  The Muslim immigrants, on average, sit on their asses, they're brought here for free stuff, and so do the Africans, to a great extent, and so do these Venezuelan gangs and others.
[02:19:26.315 --> 02:19:27.676]  They are bad news.
[02:19:28.176 --> 02:19:31.398]  And they go to the minority areas, the immigrant areas, and feed on them.
[02:19:31.719 --> 02:19:33.760]  They're the ones complaining the most.
[02:19:34.541 --> 02:19:37.763]  So yeah, the Mexican immigrants are a blessing compared to all these other ones.
[02:19:38.364 --> 02:19:39.084]  And I'll just say it.
[02:19:40.525 --> 02:19:41.085]  Anything else?
[02:19:41.746 --> 02:19:42.146]  You're gone.
[02:19:42.166 --> 02:19:43.027]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:19:43.627 --> 02:19:44.608]  We're moving quicker now.
[02:19:44.628 --> 02:19:45.808]  We got a lot of callers here.
[02:19:46.329 --> 02:19:47.750]  Roxanne, you're up next.
[02:19:48.470 --> 02:19:53.413]  And then Carlos and Joe and Lauren and so many others.
[02:19:54.193 --> 02:19:55.594]  Sean in New Mexico, stay with us.
[02:19:55.614 --> 02:19:56.215]  You're up first.
[02:19:56.835 --> 02:20:01.558]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[02:20:02.233 --> 02:20:04.636]  It is the vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.

[02:20:11.544 --> 02:20:19.154]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and rose hips.
[02:20:19.674 --> 02:20:20.775]  He believed that supercharger.
[02:20:21.395 --> 02:20:22.756]  This formula is amazing.

[02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:32.697]  Roxanne in Florida.
[02:21:32.737 --> 02:21:33.137]  Go ahead.
[02:21:34.258 --> 02:21:35.199]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:36.480]  Welcome.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:37.360]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:42.104]  You are a hero in my book, and I thank you for everything you've done all these years.
[02:21:43.038 --> 02:21:47.621]  Um, the first thing I'd like to say, I cannot wait to watch with you guys tonight.
[02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:59.709]  I hope that they make Tama Chameleon explain why she's running as if she wasn't part of the incumbent and explain the last three and a half years that they have
[02:22:02.858 --> 02:22:04.119]  I'm so glad you called.
[02:22:04.199 --> 02:22:06.501]  I'm so glad you called, because I'm up here saying, what do you ought to say?
[02:22:06.881 --> 02:22:07.742]  That's front and center.
[02:22:08.162 --> 02:22:09.383]  You keep talking about change.
[02:22:09.403 --> 02:22:11.305]  You wrecked what I did, what American people did.
[02:22:11.585 --> 02:22:16.009]  You've been in power for over three and a half years, and you should call her your Kamala, the chameleon.
[02:22:16.069 --> 02:22:17.350]  Kama-chameleon.
[02:22:17.370 --> 02:22:20.472]  You ought to say Kama-kama-kama-chameleon.
[02:22:20.813 --> 02:22:22.234]  Oh my God, you ought to scoll her that.
[02:22:23.223 --> 02:22:25.423]  Kamala, they call you the chameleon.
[02:22:25.804 --> 02:22:26.004]  Yeah.
[02:22:26.384 --> 02:22:27.804]  Who really are you, Kamala?
[02:22:27.844 --> 02:22:29.304]  You should say, who are you, Kamala?
[02:22:29.524 --> 02:22:31.105]  Tell everybody who you really are, Kamala.
[02:22:33.585 --> 02:22:37.506]  So my question, though, is really kind of immigration related.
[02:22:38.566 --> 02:22:51.629]  What I do not understand, 200 plus years, people have been watching our country with our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our freedom by law, and yet so many people
[02:22:52.256 --> 02:23:01.341]  are just immigrating here for freedom, you know, do they not realize they outnumber their establishment by like hundreds and thousands to one?
[02:23:02.942 --> 02:23:13.308]  And if they would just demand their own Bill of Rights, that they want free speech, they want, you know, the right to bear arms to defend themselves.
[02:23:15.069 --> 02:23:16.069]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:23:16.689 --> 02:23:17.270]  I'm listening.
[02:23:17.390 --> 02:23:18.290]  I was thinking about something.
[02:23:18.310 --> 02:23:19.151]  Let me let me clear.
[02:23:20.402 --> 02:23:22.643]  Mexico is the richest country now in Latin America.
[02:23:22.663 --> 02:23:24.405]  It used to be Venezuela and Argentina.
[02:23:25.805 --> 02:23:27.687]  But the Mexicans have had a bunch of revolutions.
[02:23:27.727 --> 02:23:28.707]  They at least want freedom.
[02:23:29.428 --> 02:23:33.070]  And Spain ran it, and the Germans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:35.311]  So they've got some history of wanting some basic rights.
[02:23:36.212 --> 02:23:43.736]  But you talk about people fleeing Venezuela after 30-something years of communism, or places, or El Salvador that's better now there, but their bad people are here.
[02:23:44.237 --> 02:23:46.038]  They've emptied their prisons into us.
[02:23:46.972 --> 02:23:58.203]  It's women alone, women with children that are desperate, or it's military-age men that'll come in and be controlled by the gangs that the Democrat Party at the end of the line control, that the Justice Department protects.
[02:23:58.864 --> 02:24:05.911]  And so you say, don't they realize they're here to get whatever amount of money and power they can get and to vote exactly how they're told.
[02:24:06.031 --> 02:24:08.053]  So they're not like
[02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:27.222]  Immigrants from Italy, or immigrants from Japan, or immigrants from Russia, or immigrants from Scotland, or Ireland, or, you know, areas that came here because they really wanted freedom, they're being brought in, brainwashed for up to six months at UN NGO camps, indoctrinated, given free credit cards, given free phones, given $3,000 a month, bare minimum.
[02:24:27.582 --> 02:24:28.162]  In New York, it's like $9,000.
[02:24:28.342 --> 02:24:30.644]  In Illinois, it's $9,000 a month per person.
[02:24:30.684 --> 02:24:31.264]  You can't make it up.
[02:24:31.484 --> 02:24:33.946]  The first year, then they cut it back to get them here.
[02:24:34.006 --> 02:24:36.528]  But now, we're finding, and this has come out in the news,
[02:24:37.348 --> 02:24:41.350]  The people brought in three and a half years ago by Biden have now been basically completely cut off.
[02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:43.831]  Now, like a citizen, they get a few hundred dollars a month in food stamps.
[02:24:45.112 --> 02:24:51.194]  And so they get them here, they get them indoctrinated, they get them embedded, and then they're now withdrawing the free goodies.
[02:24:51.715 --> 02:24:55.436]  So they entice them here and then take the goodies away generally within three years.
[02:24:55.536 --> 02:25:02.460]  So that's even more dangerous, because most of them never get jobs, which again will create a time bomb in the future of civil unrest.
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:02.920]  That make sense?
[02:25:04.131 --> 02:25:06.794]  Oh, I've already told my parents to be ready for that.
[02:25:06.854 --> 02:25:11.179]  I said, when that stuff gets cut off, there's going to be a lot of problems.
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:12.320]  And that's the thing.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:14.062]  I'm so glad I don't live in a big city.
[02:25:14.082 --> 02:25:15.083]  Let me give you another number.
[02:25:15.544 --> 02:25:19.008]  The UN, the IMF, the World Bank all have numbers, but the Pentagon has the same numbers.
[02:25:20.097 --> 02:25:33.142]  Okay, when food and energy hit 50% anywhere in the world on average, massive civil unrest, civil war, and just insanity, the higher you get, you hit 60% Arab Spring, okay?
[02:25:33.582 --> 02:25:35.523]  Well, so they know this.
[02:25:35.603 --> 02:25:38.804]  So anytime they want, they just throttle back the goodies.
[02:25:39.204 --> 02:25:41.665]  There's no jobs for these people, and they will explode.
[02:25:42.226 --> 02:25:45.747]  So they administratively can just cut the goodies, and these people will explode.
[02:25:46.067 --> 02:25:47.628]  And so they've put a time bomb here
[02:25:48.818 --> 02:25:52.139]  Or like a hand grenade around our neck that they can just detonate whenever they want.
[02:25:52.159 --> 02:25:52.740]  Does that make sense?
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:54.080]  Yeah.
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:55.200]  Yeah.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:56.121]  But you know what?
[02:25:56.161 --> 02:26:01.743]  A lot of it, though, like what happened in Canada and other countries, no free speech.
[02:26:02.423 --> 02:26:10.946]  If the common people would demand they get a Bill of Rights and realize they're the ones in the real power because there's so many more.
[02:26:10.966 --> 02:26:11.446]  Well, they are!
[02:26:11.526 --> 02:26:11.826]  They are!
[02:26:11.886 --> 02:26:12.527]  Trudeau got 20% of the vote!
[02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:16.807]  But he used parliamentary power to stay in control and he's trying to outlaw speech.
[02:26:16.847 --> 02:26:17.307]  God bless you.
[02:26:17.327 --> 02:26:17.747]  Great points.
[02:26:18.428 --> 02:26:19.708]  Yeah, I mean, look, look, look.
[02:26:21.529 --> 02:26:23.030]  It's in sociology papers.
[02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:29.974]  I played the clip last week of the head of the vaccine program in Texas and Houston saying white people are the ones telling everybody to revolt, not follow orders.
[02:26:30.455 --> 02:26:31.355]  They won't take the shots.
[02:26:31.375 --> 02:26:32.376]  We got to get rid of the white people.
[02:26:32.396 --> 02:26:32.856]  And she's white.
[02:26:33.497 --> 02:26:35.578]  Now that's a boiling it down, dumbing it down.
[02:26:35.598 --> 02:26:40.281]  But if you want to know about the South or you want to know about Texas, it was mainly founded
[02:26:41.383 --> 02:26:43.163]  By Scots and Irish folks.
[02:26:43.824 --> 02:26:46.204]  And that goes back to England being mad at him for always rebelling.
[02:26:46.684 --> 02:26:53.306]  So America, and it goes back to 1776, had that revolutionary spirit that you've had in Scotland and Ireland in places.
[02:26:54.387 --> 02:26:56.927]  And that's seen by the historians as a problem.
[02:26:57.727 --> 02:27:02.249]  And that if you get rid of this Magna Carta that came out of England 1100 years ago, or 900 years ago, excuse me,
[02:27:04.119 --> 02:27:07.462]  If you get rid of that, the globalists want worldwide tyranny.
[02:27:08.182 --> 02:27:09.303]  And they control people through resources.
[02:27:09.643 --> 02:27:13.987]  So you can't have the West with freedom and liberty and people aspiring to it.
[02:27:14.007 --> 02:27:16.549]  You've got to get rid of that, and then you're under global corporate rule.
[02:27:16.629 --> 02:27:17.890]  That's why we've got to be destroyed.
[02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:23.254]  But it's got to be done in an orderly collapse with the globalists posing as the saviors, so we don't know what hit us.
[02:27:23.294 --> 02:27:26.777]  That's why this show and others are so critical, so people understand what's happening.
[02:27:27.277 --> 02:27:29.879]  And then we can unbrainwash people that have been brought here, a lot of them.
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:31.580]  But Haiti,
[02:27:32.907 --> 02:27:36.470]  Is admittedly the most dangerous, insane, failed society on Earth.
[02:27:37.650 --> 02:27:38.831]  And I feel sorry for those folks.
[02:27:39.071 --> 02:27:40.172]  And the Clintons made it even worse.
[02:27:40.673 --> 02:27:42.054]  But now it's a totally failed state.
[02:27:43.034 --> 02:27:46.577]  And they're trying to bring millions of them here.
[02:27:47.978 --> 02:27:49.599]  And they're almost all military-age men.
[02:27:50.079 --> 02:27:52.041]  And they are whacked out.
[02:27:52.781 --> 02:27:54.102]  And the government's like, we don't arrest them.
[02:27:54.122 --> 02:27:54.843]  Sanctuary City.
[02:27:54.863 --> 02:27:56.364]  They have cars.
[02:27:56.404 --> 02:27:58.966]  They're being taught, do whatever you want, however you want.
[02:27:59.366 --> 02:28:01.808]  Like the police officer in Aurora we played last week.
[02:28:02.861 --> 02:28:05.463]  He goes, yeah, I had a guy for double homicide.
[02:28:05.603 --> 02:28:06.104]  Top suspect.
[02:28:06.124 --> 02:28:06.544]  We let him go.
[02:28:06.744 --> 02:28:07.225]  Sanctuary City.
[02:28:07.945 --> 02:28:08.346]  It's the law.
[02:28:09.026 --> 02:28:14.010]  Well, your little local law doesn't trump the Constitution and state laws, but they're doing it.
[02:28:14.511 --> 02:28:21.436]  So we need Trump to outlaw Sanctuary Cities, send in the federal marshal, send in the National Guard, and we gotta deport these military age men.
[02:28:21.456 --> 02:28:24.499]  And if they pull guns on the military, we're gonna kill them.
[02:28:24.859 --> 02:28:26.821]  And I'm against getting rid of posse comitatus.
[02:28:26.941 --> 02:28:28.862]  I'm against troops on the streets for citizens.
[02:28:29.403 --> 02:28:31.404]  But when you've got giant invasion forces,
[02:28:32.225 --> 02:28:33.346]  They call it a racist name.
[02:28:33.386 --> 02:28:34.266]  It's not racist at all.
[02:28:35.107 --> 02:28:40.851]  It was it's what they called someone that just came across the border and swam at a wetback, meaning they're illegal.
[02:28:40.931 --> 02:28:42.032]  Then it becomes a pejorative.
[02:28:42.452 --> 02:28:46.995]  But type in Eisenhower Operation Wetback.
[02:28:47.935 --> 02:28:50.257]  And there were millions of illegals here and gangs were forming.
[02:28:50.297 --> 02:28:50.977]  There were problems.
[02:28:51.378 --> 02:28:55.360]  And so he deported over a million and a half people in just six months.
[02:28:55.801 --> 02:28:56.641]  Operation Wetback.
[02:28:57.442 --> 02:28:58.783]  OK, and it's real simple.
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.381]  And the Mueller, Joel said the word wetback, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:03.782 --> 02:29:08.344]  They take terms that our people use, and then they say it's hateful.
[02:29:08.384 --> 02:29:09.845]  Then some people use it to be hateful.
[02:29:09.945 --> 02:29:10.685]  I don't use it as hateful.
[02:29:10.925 --> 02:29:12.286]  It's a historic thing I'm quoting.
[02:29:12.966 --> 02:29:14.687]  Just type in President Eisenhower.
[02:29:14.927 --> 02:29:15.247]  There it is.
[02:29:15.687 --> 02:29:18.749]  The largest mass deportation in American history, History Channel.
[02:29:19.329 --> 02:29:21.230]  I said over a million, see, I've got a good memory.
[02:29:21.810 --> 02:29:28.073]  As many as 1.3 million people may have been swept up in Eisenhower-era campaign called Operation Wetback.
[02:29:30.026 --> 02:29:30.466]  There you go.
[02:29:33.348 --> 02:29:35.090]  And again, the media acts like that's racist.
[02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.890]  That's knowledge.
[02:29:35.930 --> 02:29:36.731]  That's the name of it.
[02:29:36.791 --> 02:29:37.431]  That's what happened.
[02:29:39.773 --> 02:29:41.094]  They're a Bacaro program.
[02:29:44.597 --> 02:29:45.718]  All right, let's go ahead now.
[02:29:45.918 --> 02:29:49.801]  And because if a country that controls borders, you think you go to Mexico and try to stay?
[02:29:51.093 --> 02:29:52.414]  I like going to Puerto Vallarta.
[02:29:52.494 --> 02:29:53.895]  I like going to Cancun.
[02:29:53.915 --> 02:29:55.356]  They're some of the nicer, safest places.
[02:29:55.396 --> 02:29:58.078]  Great people, great food, great culture, beautiful beaches.
[02:29:58.098 --> 02:29:59.959]  I mean, my God, Puerto Vallarta's just like, whoa.
[02:30:00.579 --> 02:30:01.200]  It's like Hawaii.
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:02.901]  I'm thinking about it right now.
[02:30:02.981 --> 02:30:04.222]  I could take me to Puerto Vallarta.
[02:30:05.022 --> 02:30:10.806]  And when you get there, they hand you a form.
[02:30:10.826 --> 02:30:12.628]  You fill out how long you're there and where you're staying.
[02:30:13.988 --> 02:30:15.970]  And you get in trouble if you don't have that form when you come back.
[02:30:16.090 --> 02:30:18.612]  And if you stay an extra day or two, because I did it once in college,
[02:30:19.465 --> 02:30:22.326]  The hotel calls, the manager comes to your door and says, I noticed you booked two more days.
[02:30:22.847 --> 02:30:24.268]  Mr. Jones, you changed your plane ticket.
[02:30:24.288 --> 02:30:27.509]  You're going to have to get on the telephone, or you're going to have to go down back to the airport.
[02:30:28.170 --> 02:30:34.053]  And I had to go back to the airport and fill out forms and get bitched at, or I was going to be deported, and they had guys with machine guns standing there.
[02:30:34.693 --> 02:30:36.314]  You think the Mexicans put up with this crap?
[02:30:36.774 --> 02:30:40.076]  No, they let them come in now, the illegals, and Mexico bosses them all the way up to us.
[02:30:40.376 --> 02:30:42.237]  We need to slap a tariff on Mexico doing that.
[02:30:44.659 --> 02:30:47.100]  And I'm a tourist, they're spending money and they're ready to throw me out.
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:49.301]  Because they're trying to control their country.
[02:30:49.461 --> 02:30:50.962]  Because if you don't, it's gonna collapse.
[02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:53.783]  Sean in New Mexico, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[02:30:56.925 --> 02:30:57.125]  Hello?
[02:30:57.765 --> 02:30:58.205]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:30:58.225 --> 02:30:59.526]  Oh.
[02:31:00.166 --> 02:31:00.867]  Hey, um.
[02:31:02.427 --> 02:31:04.348]  My girlfriend and I, we both love your show.
[02:31:05.769 --> 02:31:06.369]  Love you too, brother.
[02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.889]  What's on your mind?
[02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:12.292]  Um, we wanted to talk about the illegals because you were talking about
[02:31:13.522 --> 02:31:17.684]  How New Mexico had so many illegals.
[02:31:17.864 --> 02:31:18.844]  I live in New Mexico.
[02:31:19.725 --> 02:31:20.645]  It's horrible down here.
[02:31:22.666 --> 02:31:26.288]  Yeah, the last time I was in New Mexico, I decided to drive.
[02:31:26.308 --> 02:31:27.348]  It was a business trip.
[02:31:27.408 --> 02:31:30.910]  People wanted to meet with me, and I hadn't seen the wall, so I drove by myself.
[02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:38.013]  And, like, you get out of the gas station at night, and there's, like, crazy homeless people whacked out of their brain, which is true.
[02:31:38.033 --> 02:31:40.474]  Native Americans, not all of them, but, you know, that's what's there.
[02:31:40.534 --> 02:31:41.494]  And illegals running around.
[02:31:41.514 --> 02:31:42.695]  It's pretty wild, isn't it?
[02:31:43.857 --> 02:31:44.657]  Yeah, it is wild.
[02:31:44.757 --> 02:31:46.098]  I mean, you go to a hotel, too.
[02:31:46.158 --> 02:31:47.399]  It's like Mexico Central.
[02:31:47.419 --> 02:31:48.699]  They're like, no, hello!
[02:31:48.759 --> 02:31:49.219]  How are you?
[02:31:49.299 --> 02:31:49.860]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:52.161]  They just go, you know, they just go crazy.
[02:31:52.221 --> 02:31:52.781]  You know what I mean?
[02:31:52.821 --> 02:31:56.102]  They have, you know, they're all speaking in, you know, their own language.
[02:31:56.122 --> 02:31:57.703]  You know, you wonder, are they talking about me?
[02:31:59.304 --> 02:32:03.906]  No, but, um, really, the illegals are so bad.
[02:32:04.446 --> 02:32:11.709]  I'll just have an Uber driver and they'll be, you know, you can't verify that they're illegals and stuff, but
[02:32:12.691 --> 02:32:18.175]  You know, if they don't speak English, you mean you might as well consider them one, right?
[02:32:19.076 --> 02:32:20.818]  Well, that's the good ones that speak English.
[02:32:20.838 --> 02:32:22.919]  And again, most of Mexicans get jobs.
[02:32:24.561 --> 02:32:31.226]  So that's my... I'm not trying to say we have no border to Mexico, but that's not really... I mean, most of the people coming across now are not Mexican.
[02:32:31.246 --> 02:32:31.886]  You know that, right?
[02:32:33.948 --> 02:32:34.989]  Right.
[02:32:35.029 --> 02:32:40.854]  They're from Haiti, or they're from the Middle East, or they're from... and they're no education and don't even know how to wipe their ass.
[02:32:41.929 --> 02:32:46.734]  And you see a lot of them, I'm sorry to say it, but they're like animals.
[02:32:47.274 --> 02:32:47.895]  They're crazy.
[02:32:48.996 --> 02:32:50.277]  I hear you brother and I appreciate your call.
[02:32:50.297 --> 02:32:55.503]  Well that's what, I saw Owen play a clip yesterday that I didn't have of people in Springfield, Ohio.
[02:32:56.063 --> 02:32:59.146]  And this guy like, Haitians live there, they live there, they live here.
[02:32:59.647 --> 02:33:02.089]  I decided to go see if I could get some, well he's like an auto mechanic.
[02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:04.892]  I decided, I'm gonna play the whole clip, but I decided...
[02:33:06.331 --> 02:33:08.333]  I decided I was going to go down and get some free stuff.
[02:33:08.753 --> 02:33:11.115]  They told me they gave me $75 a month.
[02:33:11.155 --> 02:33:12.015]  They gave me $3,000 and $1,000.
[02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:14.117]  And it's all Trudy Singers.
[02:33:14.137 --> 02:33:14.858]  I've looked at the news.
[02:33:16.018 --> 02:33:17.039]  So imagine you're a Haitian.
[02:33:17.059 --> 02:33:20.622]  They all got new phones, nice cars, nice clothes.
[02:33:21.503 --> 02:33:24.425]  And then the locals are like, well, I want some of that free stuff.
[02:33:24.565 --> 02:33:26.647]  Black people, white people, you name it, are pissed off.
[02:33:28.488 --> 02:33:31.450]  And like, while they're talking, there's just Haitian men walking around everywhere.
[02:33:33.872 --> 02:33:35.914]  He's like, yeah, all my neighbor's chickens are missing now.
[02:33:38.345 --> 02:33:40.167]  And meanwhile, the media's like, it's a lie.
[02:33:40.548 --> 02:33:41.869]  No one's eating your chickens.
[02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:42.610]  Yeah, right.
[02:33:43.732 --> 02:33:46.335]  You take some Haitians right off the boat and stick them next door to you.
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:51.321]  Oh my goodness.
[02:33:51.762 --> 02:33:52.603]  Let's move quicker here.
[02:33:53.504 --> 02:33:55.466]  Lauren in North Carolina, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:33:55.486 --> 02:33:55.767]  Go ahead.
[02:33:56.932 --> 02:33:59.474]  Hi, it's Loren, and I cannot wait to meet you.
[02:33:59.674 --> 02:34:05.679]  We are coming to the VIP to see you with Tucker Carlson, and I've been listening since 2000.
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:08.041]  I'm so excited to meet you.
[02:34:08.081 --> 02:34:09.822]  I have a lot to say, so I'm going to say it quick.
[02:34:10.163 --> 02:34:15.347]  I'm going to save my reviews for the six products that we take of yours at the end so that you'll have to listen to this.
[02:34:15.467 --> 02:34:21.592]  First of all, I wanted to tell you that aluminum isn't only for weather modification.
[02:34:21.612 --> 02:34:24.734]  It happens to also be an adjuvant for vaccines.
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:29.602]  Has anyone ever postulated that they're possibly spraying us with this shit?
[02:34:30.083 --> 02:34:32.964]  Secondly, Hickory is the most conservative.
[02:34:33.545 --> 02:34:39.008]  Hickory, North Carolina, District 10, is the most conservative district in North Carolina.
[02:34:39.108 --> 02:34:54.377]  I had two mail carriers tell me after the 2020 election that they were told by their supervisor to dump any ballots in neighborhoods that would appear to be Trump supporters and from homes with Trump supporter signs.
[02:34:54.887 --> 02:34:57.888]  That is another way that they're going to try to take this election.
[02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:05.491]  Thirdly, my husband is that one pediatrician who wasn't fired from his job.
[02:35:05.911 --> 02:35:09.432]  He willingly said, I would rather deliver pizza than harm a child.
[02:35:09.452 --> 02:35:15.154]  Started a new practice, Hickory Pediatric Wellness, and we are doing great now.
[02:35:15.214 --> 02:35:20.116]  Wanted to let you know he is the only pediatrician who actually left on his own accord.
[02:35:20.836 --> 02:35:23.197]  Thanks to you, and we are doing fabulous.
[02:35:23.297 --> 02:35:25.038]  We don't make our moms vaccinate.
[02:35:25.078 --> 02:35:27.359]  We don't fire patients for not vaccinating.
[02:35:27.379 --> 02:35:29.540]  And we just love you to death.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:30.560]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:34.922]  People say they can't find a doctor that won't push poison shots on their kids.
[02:35:34.962 --> 02:35:35.622]  That's not true.
[02:35:35.642 --> 02:35:36.923]  You can use a search engine.
[02:35:36.943 --> 02:35:39.184]  You should Google work, but you have to do deeper searches.
[02:35:39.244 --> 02:35:43.026]  Use alternative search engines, but you can type in doctors in your area.
[02:35:44.196 --> 02:35:47.417]  Uh, that do not force inoculations on children.
[02:35:47.457 --> 02:35:53.818]  Pediatricians in your area that are not pro-vax will also find it or who will not make you vax.
[02:35:55.238 --> 02:36:01.900]  They get massive amounts of money for the, you know this, you do this as a business, for the more kids they inject, they have bounties on your children.
[02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:04.681]  So people need to find those good doctors to support them.
[02:36:04.701 --> 02:36:06.321]  You want to plug your husband's practice?
[02:36:07.711 --> 02:36:08.412]  Sure.
[02:36:08.432 --> 02:36:11.734]  We have a wait list, but we go through it for the newborns.
[02:36:11.875 --> 02:36:14.177]  We go out of our way to help the newborns.
[02:36:14.317 --> 02:36:19.341]  So it is HickoryPediatricWellness.com.
[02:36:20.262 --> 02:36:22.203]  HickoryPediatricsWellness.com.
[02:36:22.323 --> 02:36:23.444]  And listen, let me say something about Tugger.
[02:36:23.464 --> 02:36:26.727]  Not with an S, just a pediatric.
[02:36:26.787 --> 02:36:29.850]  HickoryPediatricWellness.com.
[02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:30.430]  Got it.
[02:36:30.470 --> 02:36:31.151]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:31.171 --> 02:36:31.972]  Got it.
[02:36:32.112 --> 02:36:35.394]  Yes, it's one of the bigger stadiums they've gotten for
[02:36:36.624 --> 02:36:37.985]  I think they're going to try to expand it.
[02:36:38.065 --> 02:36:41.227]  I really look forward to meeting you understand.
[02:36:56.386 --> 02:37:03.989]  Tucker's already doing it, but he plans to take the funding from this and start a whole network with other hosts and all this stuff, but he needs funds to do it.
[02:37:04.009 --> 02:37:09.571]  I know the inside baseball, because he's not a big guy about accepting sponsors, but he's using this to expand what he's doing.
[02:37:09.971 --> 02:37:10.891]  It's going to be amazing.
[02:37:11.092 --> 02:37:12.192]  Also, Jack Posobiec.
[02:37:12.572 --> 02:37:13.012]  We're good to go.
[02:37:37.564 --> 02:37:41.687]  Of the events, some of them are selling out, so be sure and get on that now.
[02:37:41.707 --> 02:37:45.510]  You go to the front page of TuckerCarlson.com and you can find it all right there.
[02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:46.191]  Let's scroll down.
[02:37:46.231 --> 02:37:50.514]  There's Tucker Carlson with Dan Bongino in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:37:50.534 --> 02:37:52.936]  Tucker Carlson with Megan Kelly, Kansas City, Missouri.

[02:37:55.178 --> 02:37:57.439]  Tucker Carlson with Larry Elder and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
[02:37:57.780 --> 02:37:58.720]  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:03.244]  Tucker Carlson with Jesse Kelly, Rosenburg, Texas.
[02:38:03.924 --> 02:38:06.907]  On the 20th, Tucker Carlson live with Kid Rock in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[02:38:07.227 --> 02:38:08.588]  Tucker Carlson live with J.D.
[02:38:08.648 --> 02:38:10.730]  Vance, Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[02:38:10.770 --> 02:38:14.192]  The Grant Center, Tucker Carlson with Alex Jones, Reading, Pennsylvania.
[02:38:15.774 --> 02:38:19.136]  And it goes up, Tucker Carlson with Roseanne Barr, Fort Worth, Texas.

[02:38:26.522 --> 02:38:29.765]  Tucker Carlson with Donald Trump Jr., Jacksonville, Florida, and more.
[02:38:30.916 --> 02:38:33.578]  These are basically campaign events for Trump and America.
[02:38:33.678 --> 02:38:38.462]  So, TuckerCarlson.com, I want to see you in Pennsylvania, in the surrounding state.
[02:38:38.482 --> 02:38:39.302]  It's going to be amazing.
[02:38:40.163 --> 02:38:42.765]  And I intend to also go out and try to interview some of the crowd.
[02:38:42.945 --> 02:38:47.188]  I advise them they ought to go longer than two and a half hours and bring up questions from the audience.
[02:38:47.769 --> 02:38:50.231]  That's what people love, but it's really successful.
[02:38:50.731 --> 02:38:52.712]  And they're just building and building, getting bigger and bigger.
[02:38:52.753 --> 02:38:57.156]  I told in Redding, they were going to have some of the seats in the top open and all the ground.
[02:38:57.196 --> 02:38:58.397]  Now they're opening up more seats.
[02:38:58.777 --> 02:38:59.377]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:38:59.397 --> 02:39:01.138]  Just a quick comment on tonight's debate.
[02:39:01.278 --> 02:39:03.979]  And I'd like to cover the July 13 attempt on President Trump.
[02:39:03.999 --> 02:39:05.539]  First of all, tonight's debate
[02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:37.322]  There's only one major point that I can expect from Kamala Harris, which is a two-word repeat of convicted felon, convicted felon, and convicted felon.
[02:39:37.582 --> 02:39:41.964]  So I don't think there is much else that she can bring to the equation.
[02:39:42.604 --> 02:39:51.329]  And I believe, from the point of view of a cognitive psychologist, it would be that I would let her sort of talk and
[02:39:52.185 --> 02:39:55.749]  Well, did you ever hear of a kangaroo court indicting somebody of innocence?
[02:39:55.769 --> 02:39:55.849]  No.
[02:40:15.911 --> 02:40:24.018]  Well, Trump, when he calls him a felon, should say, funny, the head of public affairs for the Southern District of New York says it was all politically motivated and I'm innocent.
[02:40:24.899 --> 02:40:25.780]  That's right, correct.
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:34.208]  Now, concerning July 13th, there was something very important, very significant that has gone unnoticed.
[02:40:34.608 --> 02:40:42.175]  Number one, it just was mentioned that Crooks apparently had prepared to repeat the assassination attempt
[02:40:42.708 --> 02:40:45.689]  As was with John F. Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy.
[02:40:46.169 --> 02:41:05.216]  So, from the perspective of his aiming the rifle at his rear, the back of his head, towards the rear right temple, sorry, occipital area, then he, that possibly is what saved President Trump, because he moved his head slightly and he... Well, that's right.
[02:41:05.356 --> 02:41:07.977]  A real killer would have shot center of mass and wouldn't have missed.
[02:41:08.077 --> 02:41:09.097]  I mean, that's well known.
[02:41:09.117 --> 02:41:10.778]  You get the kill shot, you don't go over the head.
[02:41:11.499 --> 02:41:16.523]  Yeah, but the kill shot in this instance, to me, was attempted.
[02:41:17.124 --> 02:41:28.893]  And so I call the whole incident JFK 2, because I believe that's what the intent was, to have a repeat of the assassination of a president in a very public arena.
[02:41:30.667 --> 02:41:38.293]  By the way, that's admitted.
[02:41:38.333 --> 02:41:41.415]  According to what they released, he was also in the column.
[02:41:41.916 --> 02:41:44.117]  He was also in the Sandy Hook and Adam Lanza.
[02:41:44.137 --> 02:41:45.138]  See, I didn't kill the kids, folks.
[02:41:45.198 --> 02:41:45.699]  It's made up.
[02:41:46.139 --> 02:41:48.381]  They basically imply, like, you hear Sandy Hook, you think Alex Jones.
[02:41:48.601 --> 02:41:50.302]  It's just brainwashing of the public.
[02:41:50.903 --> 02:41:53.265]  But yeah, no, he wanted to repeat the Kennedy assassination.
[02:41:53.285 --> 02:41:53.625]  Key point.
[02:41:54.406 --> 02:42:00.630]  And it was a pattern that developed prior to the assassination attempt, which is not being discussed.
[02:42:01.050 --> 02:42:23.164]  The pattern was one which was begun on January 2024 by Alex Soros after the World Economic Forum, where he actually called for, you know, President Trump at all levels and at all efforts, and had a picture of a $40-something and a shot through a glass.
[02:42:24.099 --> 02:42:31.485]  And that was the beginning of what became a campaign, repeating and repeating over and over that we have to stop him.
[02:42:31.525 --> 02:42:36.650]  Yeah, the headline, if you want to pull it up, is, Did Alexander Soros Issue a Veiled Threat to Trump?
[02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:42.195]  And it's a windshield shot through, and then $47 spread out, saying kill, saying kill 47.
[02:42:42.235 --> 02:42:45.377]  Which means stop him from becoming 47.
[02:42:46.564 --> 02:42:53.187]  Yeah, and that pattern of pre-leading to the assassination repeats with President Kennedy.
[02:42:53.207 --> 02:42:58.169]  If you remember, everyone who was a teenager remembers the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[02:42:58.449 --> 02:43:05.812]  But do you know that media was calling, denigrating him with posters even on walls, asking to put him out even on November 22nd?
[02:43:06.113 --> 02:43:07.173]  No, no, I agree.
[02:43:07.193 --> 02:43:09.194]  So you're saying they're going to really try to kill Trump again?
[02:43:11.607 --> 02:43:15.430]  Hold on Carlos, I gotta go to break.
[02:43:15.450 --> 02:43:15.870]  Stay there.
[02:43:15.890 --> 02:43:16.851]  I want you to finish your point.
[02:43:16.891 --> 02:43:18.773]  Then Joe, Charles, and Tanner.
[02:43:18.813 --> 02:43:22.055]  And who's, Maria Z is hosting the fourth hour.
[02:43:22.075 --> 02:43:22.736]  Then Owen Schroyer.
[02:43:23.236 --> 02:43:25.358]  And then basically live coverage of the debate's already begun.
[02:43:25.378 --> 02:43:31.303]  But 6pm we'll launch a new stream that says, watch the Harris-Trump debate live here.
[02:43:32.023 --> 02:43:35.744]  With analysis by Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and other special guests.

[02:43:43.426 --> 02:43:45.466]  I want this feed on the War Room.
[02:43:46.286 --> 02:43:47.647]  I want it on American Journal.

[02:43:50.787 --> 02:43:51.328]  You'll get that.
[02:43:51.828 --> 02:43:56.669]  But I want all the ongoing live feeds that loop after the show's over for a day.
[02:43:57.589 --> 02:43:58.430]  I want everything!

[02:44:23.293 --> 02:44:24.433]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:24.593 --> 02:44:25.593]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:25.934 --> 02:44:37.797]  Check out the Infowars MD line of products, the CBD gummies and tincture, the thousand milligram vitamin C and other combos, the body's ultimate turmeric formula, and get next level financial energy about to sell out at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:44:37.877 --> 02:44:40.118]  Go now, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:44:40.678 --> 02:44:48.200]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.100]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:58.222]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[02:44:58.242 --> 02:45:01.802]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[02:45:02.283 --> 02:45:08.424]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[02:45:09.344 --> 02:45:18.028]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[02:45:18.228 --> 02:45:27.311]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[02:45:27.691 --> 02:45:28.852]  These are very, very popular.
[02:45:28.872 --> 02:45:29.932]  And I went and looked it up online.
[02:45:30.332 --> 02:45:31.253]  It is very, very popular.
[02:45:31.853 --> 02:45:32.774]  It's not an investment.
[02:45:32.974 --> 02:45:33.594]  It's a collectible.
[02:45:33.775 --> 02:45:40.699]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:42.200]  Best group out there.
[02:45:42.501 --> 02:45:43.261]  Highest ratings.
[02:45:43.802 --> 02:45:44.682]  Amazing prices.
[02:45:44.722 --> 02:45:45.182]  The best.
[02:45:45.403 --> 02:45:49.485]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:57.731]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here in your store.
[02:45:58.832 --> 02:45:59.653]  And they kicked him back.
[02:46:00.777 --> 02:46:04.519]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[02:46:04.819 --> 02:46:15.966]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[02:46:16.486 --> 02:46:24.871]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[02:46:25.451 --> 02:46:26.772]  They're amazing cards.
[02:46:26.792 --> 02:46:28.633]  It's got original art I came up with.
[02:46:28.653 --> 02:46:30.534]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[02:46:30.594 --> 02:46:33.495]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[02:46:33.515 --> 02:46:34.316]  You'll have a historical memento.
[02:46:48.402 --> 02:46:53.303]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight.
[02:46:53.703 --> 02:46:57.524]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[02:46:57.884 --> 02:46:59.204]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:46:59.844 --> 02:47:02.745]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple of years ago.
[02:47:03.325 --> 02:47:06.306]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[02:47:06.686 --> 02:47:11.527]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse and the other half are available right now.
[02:47:11.907 --> 02:47:13.987]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[02:47:14.808 --> 02:47:16.788]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[02:47:17.288 --> 02:47:20.750]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[02:47:20.770 --> 02:47:21.411]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:47:21.951 --> 02:47:24.153]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[02:47:24.173 --> 02:47:24.953]  That's not what this is.
[02:47:24.973 --> 02:47:26.014]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[02:47:26.607 --> 02:47:39.720]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:40.921]  I know you don't want to do that.
[02:47:41.642 --> 02:47:46.467]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[02:47:49.087 --> 02:47:52.010]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[02:47:52.050 --> 02:47:55.193]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[02:47:55.713 --> 02:48:03.401]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[02:48:03.781 --> 02:48:04.862]  The decision is yours.
[02:48:04.882 --> 02:48:06.304]  This is a limited edition.
[02:48:06.944 --> 02:48:11.266]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[02:48:11.946 --> 02:48:22.251]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[02:48:22.611 --> 02:48:31.514]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[02:48:31.895 --> 02:48:32.755]  Thank you for your support.
[02:48:33.115 --> 02:48:34.776]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[02:48:40.666 --> 02:48:44.650]  Well, just essentially that there is no kangaroo court that has ever convicted anyone of being innocent.
[02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:44.750]  Okay?
[02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:49.595]  And so in the case of tonight's debate, I think it's a question of President Trump letting Kamala Harris
[02:49:05.169 --> 02:49:05.989]  We're good to go.
[02:49:33.251 --> 02:49:44.717]  And they're trying to pre-program the media that, oh, if Trump is mean to her in any way, he's the bad guy.
[02:49:44.777 --> 02:49:44.937]  No.
[02:49:45.677 --> 02:49:47.598]  They've been calling for his imprisonment, all of it.
[02:49:47.879 --> 02:49:48.539]  She's a thug.
[02:49:48.579 --> 02:49:49.980]  He needs to tear the living hell out of her.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:55.863]  Yeah, well, she is not fit to be president of the United States of America.
[02:49:56.183 --> 02:49:57.744]  It's really part of the clown show.
[02:49:58.184 --> 02:50:00.165]  And in reality, Americans
[02:50:00.555 --> 02:50:08.380]  And everyone in the world who's watching this must be shaking their head wondering what happened to the real world of the American that everyone knows.
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:09.760]  Absolutely, Carlos.
[02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:10.281]  Great points.
[02:50:10.321 --> 02:50:10.821]  Got to jump.
[02:50:10.881 --> 02:50:11.641]  Joe in New York.
[02:50:11.681 --> 02:50:12.482]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:50:15.183 --> 02:50:20.426]  Haitians grabbing pets out of yards and snatching ducks at parks and eating them.
[02:50:21.087 --> 02:50:23.248]  You think that's going to be a topic tonight, perhaps?
[02:50:23.408 --> 02:50:23.948]  A rebuttal?
[02:50:25.793 --> 02:50:39.019]  It's funny, the public doesn't care as much about 325,000 missing kids, a lot of them in sex slavery and slave labor, but they do care about the image of people roaming around eating your animals.
[02:50:39.079 --> 02:50:44.902]  But again, for me, it's the insurance rates have doubled because the Haitians are given cars without a driver's license to drive around like maniacs.
[02:50:45.202 --> 02:50:47.043]  And I've been in Florida and watched the Haitians drive.
[02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:47.843]  It's something scary.
[02:50:49.312 --> 02:50:50.012]  Well, that too.
[02:50:50.733 --> 02:50:59.516]  Now, to bring that up, if you listen to Kamala talk, I'm from the Bronx, and she sounds like people that used to snort heroin.
[02:50:59.916 --> 02:51:06.619]  And I think that perhaps she snorts something and she sounds very nasal when you listen to her.
[02:51:06.799 --> 02:51:10.620]  And that is a justifiable thing to have a drug test.
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:12.101]  I don't know what the big deal is.
[02:51:12.839 --> 02:51:15.301]  I mean, if she's doing dope, she's doing dope.
[02:51:15.321 --> 02:51:17.643]  Yeah, Trump asked for a drug test to Biden.
[02:51:17.703 --> 02:51:19.244]  He should challenge her to do a drug test.
[02:51:19.704 --> 02:51:20.945]  And say he'll do one, too.
[02:51:22.026 --> 02:51:22.727]  He should.
[02:51:23.407 --> 02:51:24.788]  And just one more thing, Alex.
[02:51:25.569 --> 02:51:27.430]  Tell your moderators to let me back on.
[02:51:27.490 --> 02:51:31.673]  For some reason, they banned me and they censored me from your site.
[02:51:32.314 --> 02:51:33.054]  I'd appreciate that.
[02:51:33.074 --> 02:51:36.177]  We don't even really have InfoWars.com or Banned.Video.
[02:51:37.978 --> 02:51:38.519]  InfoWars.com.
[02:51:39.582 --> 02:51:42.005]  I don't even think we even have moderators.
[02:51:42.045 --> 02:51:45.189]  We use a computer program and they're always updating and it does stuff.
[02:51:45.209 --> 02:51:47.532]  I mean, I don't even think there is moderators, brother, but I hear you.
[02:51:47.572 --> 02:51:48.033]  Thanks for the call.
[02:51:48.053 --> 02:51:49.475]  I mean, you got it on air right now.
[02:51:49.976 --> 02:51:51.417]  Just ask what you're calling about and put you on air.
[02:51:51.457 --> 02:51:52.959]  So I just thank you.
[02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:55.663]  Charles in Ohio, then Tanner.
[02:51:55.723 --> 02:51:56.264]  Go ahead, Charles.
[02:51:57.153 --> 02:52:14.478]  Hey, Alex, there's two things you can probably straighten me out real fast, but I understand Kennedy was a candidate, and his endorsement of Trump is okay, but him selectively picking states, I think the opposition will use that as an excuse to contest the election.
[02:52:15.791 --> 02:52:24.219]  I mean, I think he's allowed, they checked the law, he's allowed to stay on the ballot in some, but they're not letting him off in Michigan and Wisconsin, North Carolina.
[02:52:24.259 --> 02:52:25.039]  Was it North Carolina?
[02:52:25.079 --> 02:52:26.381]  Yeah, just let him off of the ballot.
[02:52:26.801 --> 02:52:34.688]  But again, they would then, if they're not letting him off the ballot in Michigan, then they can't let Biden off the ballot.
[02:52:34.708 --> 02:52:35.289]  Do you understand that?
[02:52:35.909 --> 02:52:36.570]  Yes, I do.
[02:52:37.010 --> 02:52:42.235]  Another thing, the reason for electric vehicles, this is a puzzle.
[02:52:42.705 --> 02:52:45.466]  And when all the parts fit, you come up with the right conclusion.
[02:52:45.806 --> 02:52:49.246]  And I say, electric vehicles aren't being pushed in America.
[02:52:49.266 --> 02:52:54.227]  They're being pushed in America, Europe, and Asia, and China, and Russia.
[02:52:54.687 --> 02:52:56.007]  So this is the thing.
[02:52:56.567 --> 02:53:01.588]  The development of electric vehicle is the same as the space program in the 70s.
[02:53:01.948 --> 02:53:04.249]  They think that that will save the U.S.
[02:53:04.329 --> 02:53:04.809]  economy.
[02:53:05.229 --> 02:53:10.710]  That's why they want all of us to contribute to the research by buying electric vehicles.
[02:53:11.150 --> 02:53:12.430]  And it ties in more than that.
[02:53:12.570 --> 02:53:16.632]  It ties in with the electronic dollars they're trying to switch us to.
[02:53:16.772 --> 02:53:19.172]  Yeah, no, they want a smart car they can turn off.
[02:53:19.492 --> 02:53:21.493]  They already got remote control switches on all the cars by law.
[02:53:21.973 --> 02:53:22.433]  Great points.
[02:53:22.453 --> 02:53:23.274]  You're dead on, Charles.
[02:53:23.294 --> 02:53:23.694]  Thank you.
[02:53:23.714 --> 02:53:24.734]  Tanner, last caller.
[02:53:24.774 --> 02:53:26.615]  And then Maria Z takes over.
[02:53:26.695 --> 02:53:28.955]  Live coverage of the debate right here at InfoWars.
[02:53:29.195 --> 02:53:30.556]  Please join us and please boost us.
[02:53:30.796 --> 02:53:31.756]  You are the key to everything.
[02:53:32.076 --> 02:53:37.918]  This reminds me of a true masterpiece by the great director, Millis, Conan the Barbarian.
[02:53:39.093 --> 02:53:41.174]  With James Earl Jones and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:53:41.595 --> 02:53:42.495]  What a classic movie.
[02:53:42.535 --> 02:53:43.876]  Just watched that again a few weeks ago.
[02:53:45.037 --> 02:53:46.578]  Very fascist, the left said.
[02:53:46.898 --> 02:53:47.518]  Excellent film.
[02:53:48.019 --> 02:53:50.560]  James Earl Jones was such a master, he died yesterday at 93.
[02:53:51.681 --> 02:53:52.922]  The voice of Darth Vader.
[02:53:54.043 --> 02:53:57.205]  The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
[02:53:58.444 --> 02:54:00.345]  Don't act so surprised, your highness.
[02:54:00.806 --> 02:54:02.987]  You aren't on any mercy mission this time.
[02:54:03.407 --> 02:54:06.629]  Guys, I'd asked you at the start of the show or before the show to get that promo.
[02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:08.891]  We have an air in a year for Bandop video with Darth Vader.
[02:54:08.911 --> 02:54:09.551]  Can you guys find that?
[02:54:09.571 --> 02:54:15.555]  I want to hand the baton to Maria Z, but I want to get that on air before the transmission ends.
[02:54:15.575 --> 02:54:19.077]  Can I pretty please triple cupcakes on top, have that?
[02:54:22.559 --> 02:54:22.979]  Silence.
[02:54:24.847 --> 02:54:28.189]  Or go ask Rob Doerr to just get it, because I asked for it like five times, and I'm not mad.
[02:54:28.370 --> 02:54:32.112]  I just have this neuroses now where I've said I need something, I've got to air it.
[02:54:33.073 --> 02:54:35.194]  But we'll definitely play him as Thulsa Doom.
[02:54:36.775 --> 02:54:38.997]  Thulsa Doom on his mountain of power.
[02:54:41.159 --> 02:54:42.559]  Is there a daggers, which is this for me?
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:43.740]  We have it?
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:44.501]  Here's the promo.
[02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:53.451]  Stop!
[02:54:53.471 --> 02:54:53.771]  Stop it!
[02:54:53.791 --> 02:54:54.552]  We're going to do it right!
[02:54:54.852 --> 02:54:55.212]  Woo!
[02:54:55.232 --> 02:54:56.293]  We're going to do it, baby!
[02:54:56.353 --> 02:54:57.213]  We're going to do it!
[02:54:57.293 --> 02:54:58.114]  We're going to do it!
[02:54:58.174 --> 02:54:59.115]  We're going to... Because I'm not mad.
[02:54:59.615 --> 02:55:00.736]  I just... They told me it's ready.
[02:55:01.576 --> 02:55:01.937]  It's ready.
[02:55:01.977 --> 02:55:02.517]  So we're going to wait.
[02:55:02.557 --> 02:55:06.119]  We're going to build the suspense for a while so we can have it prepared.
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:07.820]  And then I'm going to play Thulsa Doom.
[02:55:07.901 --> 02:55:14.065]  And then I'm going to hand the baton to Maria Z. And then we're going to have incredible live coverage tonight of the debate.
[02:55:14.525 --> 02:55:15.646]  By the way, the crew does a great job.
[02:55:15.966 --> 02:55:17.767]  Most live shows are all pre-prepared.
[02:55:17.787 --> 02:55:19.668]  They have a whole list of what they're going to do, when they're going to do it.
[02:55:20.049 --> 02:55:21.750]  I did this for Seat of My Pants, not the crew's fault.
[02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:25.031]  I get a lot of orders and stuff falls to the cracks.
[02:55:25.071 --> 02:55:25.732]  It's all my fault.
[02:55:26.072 --> 02:55:27.172]  But we'll have that for you in a moment.
[02:55:28.773 --> 02:55:29.913]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:55:29.994 --> 02:55:31.174]  Last caller for this show.
[02:55:31.554 --> 02:55:32.655]  Tanner in Texas.
[02:55:32.675 --> 02:55:33.195]  You're on the air.
[02:55:33.235 --> 02:55:33.775]  Go ahead, Tanner.
[02:55:35.056 --> 02:55:48.882]  Yeah, Alex, forgive me for my nerves, but I was a missionary in Haiti, and hearing your description of the Dominican Republic versus Haiti is something that I've said for many years.
[02:55:49.642 --> 02:55:51.103]  And that stirring in your spirit,
[02:55:51.616 --> 02:55:58.999]  Of you telling people to go 100%, to go all in with calling things out, you're right on target.
[02:55:59.359 --> 02:56:08.102]  Because we look at the people in Ohio, and they look completely disarmed, afraid to speak out against evil.
[02:56:09.142 --> 02:56:16.204]  Haiti, not only the land has been cursed, but it's all the way out to the coral in the ocean, if you look at it.
[02:56:20.898 --> 02:56:26.362]  At the home place of Voodoo, I was stranded there back in the late 90s.
[02:56:26.482 --> 02:56:43.214]  It was 95% illegitimate children, and if we don't understand that this is a war on breaking down the family unit, and what a blessed land that we live on, and what that carries through in the spiritual realm.
[02:56:44.014 --> 02:56:46.176]  Well, describe as a missionary what Haiti's like.
[02:56:49.216 --> 02:56:56.018]  I've actually also been to the two poorest nations in the world, Haiti and Bangladesh.
[02:56:56.718 --> 02:57:00.839]  I worked at Mother Teresa's home of the dying and destitute in Calcutta.
[02:57:01.999 --> 02:57:04.740]  Haiti is still the worst place on earth that I've ever been.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:08.581]  We as Americans cannot conceive what it's like there.
[02:57:09.781 --> 02:57:12.302]  The men hang out together.
[02:57:12.322 --> 02:57:17.143]  I believe there's more handguns per capita than anywhere in the world.
[02:57:18.087 --> 02:57:27.390]  You'll have one man that has a essentially a block of females with children that just run around barefoot without shoes.
[02:57:28.951 --> 02:57:37.413]  We built a school across from a compound and it's nothing to see a witch doctor right across the street.
[02:57:37.613 --> 02:57:45.676]  I don't, you know, I highly doubt in Austin, Texas that anyone would celebrate Mardi Gras if they actually went to the places where
[02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:47.878]  Uh, it's truly celebrated.
[02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:59.111]  Again, people say, why do you care about Dominican Republic?
[02:57:59.151 --> 02:57:59.951]  It's the same island.
[02:58:00.011 --> 02:58:01.091]  It's all pretty much nice.
[02:58:01.732 --> 02:58:02.732]  And Haiti's the same land.
[02:58:02.772 --> 02:58:03.432]  Total hellhole.
[02:58:03.812 --> 02:58:05.453]  Deforestation, sewage everywhere.
[02:58:06.053 --> 02:58:08.774]  Describe for people, how many loose animals do you see running around?
[02:58:08.894 --> 02:58:10.994]  Because the media's like, oh, nobody eats your chickens.
[02:58:11.034 --> 02:58:12.155]  Nobody eats your goats.
[02:58:12.635 --> 02:58:13.615]  Nobody eats your dog.
[02:58:13.655 --> 02:58:14.535]  Nobody eats your cat.
[02:58:14.575 --> 02:58:19.457]  Nobody eats your animals or your swans or your geese at the lake.
[02:58:20.597 --> 02:58:22.558]  I mean, you don't see a lot of animals walking around there, do you?
[02:58:22.578 --> 02:58:23.238]  Because they're dinnertime.
[02:58:24.867 --> 02:58:30.992]  No, Alex, and actually, again, we just can't conceive of it as Americans.
[02:58:31.032 --> 02:58:38.677]  You know, there's not electricity after five o'clock, even if you're fortunate enough to be in a place that might have electricity.
[02:58:39.338 --> 02:58:44.882]  The animal life is the random neutrino, which would terrify you.
[02:58:45.602 --> 02:58:47.084]  And rats, there's not.
[02:58:48.264 --> 02:58:52.868]  There's not wildlife going in and trying to teach
[02:58:53.809 --> 02:58:56.291]  Children and build a school there.
[02:58:56.311 --> 02:59:08.499]  I worked in the orphanages and they basically you have to teach them the basics of to not play with the needles that the hospitals dump right out in the ocean.
[02:59:10.361 --> 02:59:15.685]  You know, and I don't understand why no one's asking the basic question of why Springfield, Ohio.
[02:59:16.345 --> 02:59:21.649]  Five minutes of research will tell you that that is an all Republican versus Republican
[02:59:22.827 --> 02:59:23.608]  I think so.
[02:59:36.714 --> 02:59:39.196]  Uh, the guy coming in that's going to take over the job?
[03:00:06.363 --> 03:00:07.686]  And I'll be doing some hits on other shows.
[03:00:07.706 --> 03:00:08.568]  They'll be doing hits with us.
[03:00:09.229 --> 03:00:12.936]  But it's going to be myself, Chase Geyser, Owen Schroyer, and others.
[03:00:14.704 --> 03:00:15.684]  Hosting tonight.
[03:00:16.565 --> 03:00:17.445]  It starts 8 o'clock.
[03:00:17.485 --> 03:00:18.986]  We got pregame, all of it.
[03:00:19.626 --> 03:00:21.027]  We'll be taking your calls as well.
[03:00:21.467 --> 03:00:27.770]  So stay with us and take the feeds from Real Alex Jones and InfoWars.com forward slash show on the front page of InfoWars and share them.
[03:00:27.810 --> 03:00:29.211]  Say, watch the debate here tonight.
[03:00:29.591 --> 03:00:30.651]  Email it, text message it.
[03:00:30.671 --> 03:00:31.532]  That's how we reach new people.
[03:00:31.872 --> 03:00:33.833]  Then they'll tune in, they'll like the show, they'll start listening.
[03:00:34.173 --> 03:00:36.594]  And it's just every day, you've got the power.
[03:00:36.654 --> 03:00:38.335]  You'll decide whether we defeat the evil or not.
[03:00:39.742 --> 03:00:43.064]  When you get the urgency and know how serious this is, we're going to turn this around.
[03:00:43.124 --> 03:00:45.205]  And please, buy products from us.

[03:01:06.697 --> 03:01:07.097]  Not anymore.
[03:01:07.497 --> 03:01:08.758]  She takes a little half-dropper of that.
[03:01:09.776 --> 03:01:10.577]  20 minutes later, she's out.

[03:01:45.523 --> 03:01:49.885]  With myself doing a James Earl Jones imitation as Darth Vader with a quick little promo.
[03:01:50.185 --> 03:01:57.149]  And then we're going to go to James Earl Jones in his iconic Thulsa Doom from Millis' Conan the Barbarian.
[03:01:57.689 --> 03:02:02.852]  And then right when that's over, we will hand the baton to the mighty Maria Z. Here it is.
[03:02:02.952 --> 03:02:04.453]  And happy trails to James Earl Jones.
[03:02:05.871 --> 03:02:08.613]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[03:02:08.974 --> 03:02:12.297]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[03:02:12.777 --> 03:02:16.180]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:20.684]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[03:02:20.764 --> 03:02:26.048]  You killed my mother!
[03:02:27.569 --> 03:02:28.690]  You killed my father!
[03:02:28.710 --> 03:02:30.171]  You killed my people!
[03:02:30.712 --> 03:02:32.613]  You took my father's sword!
[03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:38.750]  It must have been when I was younger.
[03:02:38.770 --> 03:02:43.391]  There was a time, boy, when I searched for steel.
[03:02:44.632 --> 03:02:47.713]  And steel meant more to me than gold or jewels.
[03:02:50.334 --> 03:02:52.975]  The Ribble of Steel.
[03:02:53.996 --> 03:02:54.776]  Yes.
[03:02:55.816 --> 03:02:57.637]  You know what it is, don't you, boy?
[03:02:58.998 --> 03:02:59.578]  Shall I tell you?
[03:02:59.598 --> 03:03:01.679]  It's the least I can do.
[03:03:04.756 --> 03:03:06.919]  Steel isn't strong, boy.
[03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:09.022]  Flesh is stronger.
[03:03:10.163 --> 03:03:10.784]  Look around you.
[03:03:14.349 --> 03:03:14.649]  There.
[03:03:15.811 --> 03:03:16.371]  On the rocks.
[03:03:18.174 --> 03:03:19.155]  That beautiful girl.
[03:03:21.338 --> 03:03:22.059]  Come to me, my child.
[03:03:32.911 --> 03:03:34.913]  That is strength, boy.
[03:03:35.714 --> 03:03:37.195]  That is power.
[03:03:37.915 --> 03:03:39.817]  The strength and power of flesh.
[03:03:41.338 --> 03:03:44.601]  What is steel compared to the hand that wheels it?
[03:03:45.742 --> 03:03:48.984]  Look at the strength of your body, the desire in your heart.
[03:03:50.105 --> 03:03:51.166]  I gave you this.
[03:03:53.108 --> 03:03:53.828]  Such a waste.
[03:03:57.952 --> 03:03:59.933]  Contemplate this on the tree of woe.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:07.660]  Crucify him.
[03:04:13.061 --> 03:04:14.962]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:15.002 --> 03:04:18.443]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of zmedia.com.
[03:04:18.723 --> 03:04:27.965]  And following on from the theme of that last caller that just rang in and spoke with Alex, we have a problem with savages coming and eating animals.
[03:04:28.685 --> 03:04:32.446]  My question is, which other small biological entity will be next?
[03:04:32.506 --> 03:04:34.026]  And I don't ask that lightly.
[03:04:34.721 --> 03:04:40.743]  We just had another foreigner in Australia pour scalding hot coffee over a nine-month baby.
[03:04:41.303 --> 03:04:46.765]  But these are probably the smallest issues, if you can believe it, that we have to worry about.
[03:04:46.805 --> 03:04:58.870]  You might have seen the breaking report from James O'Keefe last week, or earlier this week, about the gang, Trandaragua, which, to be honest with you,
[03:04:59.454 --> 03:05:02.021]  People always say, who's doing anything about this?
[03:05:02.061 --> 03:05:06.352]  And there are people doing about it, but we have a real lack of action.
[03:05:07.134 --> 03:05:12.597]  And efforts to stifle the progress of the people exposing this on the ground.
[03:05:12.677 --> 03:05:29.505]  One of those people who's been acutely aware of this and has been, you know, a real expert on issues of the border and the violent gangs that are being imported or allowed in to the United States is Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers.
[03:05:29.545 --> 03:05:32.226]  He's a former Green Beret, been on this broadcast many times.
[03:05:32.930 --> 03:05:37.753]  He's also part of a Central Texas think tank that works on open source intelligence gathering.
[03:05:37.793 --> 03:05:39.934]  He has a lot of information for us today.
[03:05:39.994 --> 03:05:42.356]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, thank you so much for being here with us.
[03:05:43.536 --> 03:05:44.717]  It's good to be here, Maria.
[03:05:45.418 --> 03:05:46.478]  Great to see you again.
[03:05:47.679 --> 03:05:48.700]  Likewise, likewise.
[03:05:48.740 --> 03:05:55.264]  Well, we had this news about TREND ARAGUA, this CUI that came out, which is
[03:05:56.793 --> 03:05:58.614]  You know, sort of, again, open source.
[03:05:59.394 --> 03:06:11.499]  And they're saying is that as of July 28, 2024, an identified transnational criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, stated that law enforcement officers are greenlit for attack by members of the organization.
[03:06:11.539 --> 03:06:18.022]  We also have evidence of this gang taking over units in Colorado, a hotel in Texas as well, I'm reading.
[03:06:18.762 --> 03:06:20.223]  So I want to hear from you.
[03:06:20.323 --> 03:06:21.964]  How long have you known about this?
[03:06:23.264 --> 03:06:26.405]  They're making out like this is something new, but that is not the case.
[03:06:27.086 --> 03:06:28.106]  No, not at all, Maria.
[03:06:28.166 --> 03:06:43.671]  You know, this relationship between Venezuela and the countries of Hamas, Hezbollah origin, which would be Iran and some of the other states down that we've been dealing with when we're watching what's going on in the Palestinian region.
[03:06:44.832 --> 03:06:50.594]  These alliances, alliances have been going on for at least 15 to 20 years as far as we know.
[03:06:51.144 --> 03:07:06.207]  All right, now, come onto the scene for me coming out of the Middle East fighting in 2015, 2016, 2018, coming back to the United States, joining the Texas National Guard and being on the border, we were able to observe firsthand the intelligence that was coming across.
[03:07:06.267 --> 03:07:11.989]  Now, some of it's a lot more sensitive than a CUI, C-U-I, labeled document that comes out of Army North.
[03:07:12.369 --> 03:07:13.629]  Army North does a good job.
[03:07:13.969 --> 03:07:16.710]  They do report on things and they do have analysts that
[03:07:17.350 --> 03:07:17.570]  Thank you.
[03:07:36.508 --> 03:07:41.671]  Remnant Ministries, Marshall, that's not us, but it just popped up on the screen.
[03:07:42.532 --> 03:07:44.973]  Those guys are pretty rough actors, right?
[03:07:44.993 --> 03:07:46.715]  They're the nugs on the ground, if you will.
[03:07:46.735 --> 03:07:51.718]  They're the ones that do the action arm of creating the chaos in this country.
[03:07:52.058 --> 03:08:00.623]  So when we were on the border, when I was on Operation Lone Star, took off my uniform in October 2022 and left and came back to the civilian world working in this think tank,
[03:08:01.964 --> 03:08:11.569]  What we saw there was, as they infiltrated, much smaller numbers then, and I'll explain what's happened since then, they weren't that active, they weren't that organized.
[03:08:11.729 --> 03:08:31.159]  These guys were really pretty much open to whatever game there was in town, be it petty thievery, things like that, some elicitation, some strong-arming, but they've really organized now, and they've organized under the banners of several different organizations, some of which we're going to keep close hold because we are investigating it ourselves.
[03:08:31.659 --> 03:08:36.567]  So the information that we got was right around December of this last year, 23.
[03:08:36.727 --> 03:08:43.958]  And the information came in 230 pages of documents directly out of the Venezuelan
[03:08:46.045 --> 03:08:48.669]  Place where we pick the information up, right?
[03:08:48.689 --> 03:08:50.532]  So I'm just going to say that this is verifiable.
[03:08:50.552 --> 03:08:51.333]  This is actionable.
[03:08:51.734 --> 03:09:00.026]  And this was given over in February of this year after we verified it because a couple months to verify it that we gave that over to Texas law enforcement.
[03:09:00.046 --> 03:09:01.589]  So they do have it at the highest levels.
[03:09:02.029 --> 03:09:09.391]  Now, that being said, there are investigations that are going on, and what we do is we come along the side and we advise and assist, and that's all we can do.
[03:09:09.431 --> 03:09:15.652]  We don't have the authorities to go and close the gap and to affect arrests upon these individuals.
[03:09:16.093 --> 03:09:19.213]  We saw these things really kind of trending, as J.J.
[03:09:19.233 --> 03:09:21.554]  Carroll, who's had movie treason coming out,
[03:09:22.254 --> 03:09:31.705]  Which he interviewed us for that was in Chicago that was in Nashville That was in some other big cities up north and now we're seeing it come down into Texas.
[03:09:31.765 --> 03:09:41.677]  We've been seeing it in smaller Increments, but now it's just it's just exploded Maria and that's what we're working on right now And there are several different hot spots in Texas that we're working on
[03:09:42.686 --> 03:09:43.988]  Here's the real problem, okay?
[03:09:44.028 --> 03:09:46.491]  You've put out a video in December, as you mentioned.
[03:09:46.532 --> 03:09:50.877]  Team, if you can queue up Doc TDA El Paso, please.
[03:09:50.998 --> 03:09:52.319]  We'll play that in just a moment.
[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:55.584]  Because you've... This is what I keep trying to...
[03:09:57.017 --> 03:10:00.040]  People keep saying, well, who, where are the men at the border?
[03:10:00.100 --> 03:10:02.382]  Where are the people doing what needs to be done?
[03:10:02.802 --> 03:10:05.084]  You're one of the people that's doing what needs to be done.
[03:10:05.124 --> 03:10:12.371]  The problem is that there are actual, I'm going to show everyone in a moment, efforts to stifle the efforts of people like you.
[03:10:12.951 --> 03:10:15.773]  And also, there's an inaction from law enforcement.
[03:10:15.793 --> 03:10:29.023]  Now, had they paid attention to this particular video when you notified, hang on, something's very wrong here, then maybe we'd be in a different situation and we wouldn't have violent gangs taking over apartment buildings, hotels and terrorising communities.
[03:10:29.063 --> 03:10:32.046]  Tim, if you can queue up that clip, please, Doc El Paso.
[03:10:33.083 --> 03:10:35.344]  Doc Chambers from Eagle Pass, Texas.
[03:10:36.004 --> 03:10:37.405]  Today's the 18th of December.
[03:10:38.185 --> 03:10:39.966]  We're out here at the point of entry.
[03:10:40.946 --> 03:10:42.787]  5,000 are sitting on the ground right now.
[03:10:42.947 --> 03:10:45.108]  It's increasing as we go along.
[03:10:45.688 --> 03:10:52.250]  Information that we've received says another 7,000 should be processed through this particular point by morning.
[03:10:53.851 --> 03:10:55.171]  Joe and I have been here many times.
[03:10:55.611 --> 03:10:58.913]  Last time we were down here we were in uniform and now I'm a civilian.
[03:10:59.995 --> 03:11:01.556]  And in the army of God.
[03:11:02.076 --> 03:11:04.277]  So we'll keep telling truths.
[03:11:05.077 --> 03:11:13.400]  And you need to get this video to your legislators and tell them, in the state of Texas particularly, this is out of control.
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:15.300]  Thank you very much.
[03:11:16.301 --> 03:11:16.741]  Right.
[03:11:16.761 --> 03:11:21.322]  So that was December the 18th in Eagle Pass and that was out of control.
[03:11:21.342 --> 03:11:23.483]  And those people now are in the interior.
[03:11:23.523 --> 03:11:24.784]  There are 12,500 came across that night.
[03:11:27.546 --> 03:11:32.287]  Tim, if you can just play the B-roll of the drone footage while we discuss this.
[03:11:32.347 --> 03:11:34.567]  So this is December of last year.
[03:11:35.448 --> 03:11:44.409]  We're talking nine months down the track and we've allowed it to get to the point now where these violent gangs, I mean, I've seen videos of them, Doc.
[03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:46.770]  They're robbing stores.
[03:11:46.830 --> 03:11:52.071]  They're coming in, according to this report here, they are wielding
[03:11:53.291 --> 03:11:53.771]  Where is it?
[03:11:54.112 --> 03:11:58.476]  In this article, Tim, I've sent you that article as well about the hotel.
[03:11:59.056 --> 03:12:10.206]  They're wielding, you know, sharp knives, terrorizing people, hatchets, another man with a hatchet assaulting people, you know, knives, shooting guns.
[03:12:10.286 --> 03:12:13.308]  I mean, this is very, very, very serious.
[03:12:13.328 --> 03:12:15.090]  Right.
[03:12:16.047 --> 03:12:18.229]  Yeah, Maria, this is just an example.
[03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:28.098]  These were all Venezuelans that came up, this particular footage is from our drone, that came up that night in a convoy or caravan, so to speak, and they showed up.
[03:12:29.119 --> 03:12:34.764]  We stayed there on the ground and watched them, and we followed them on buses all the way to San Antonio, Texas.
[03:12:35.384 --> 03:12:36.725]  Now, we need to look at this thing in a
[03:12:37.705 --> 03:12:40.187]  From the way that we analyze stuff and I'll explain it.
[03:12:40.507 --> 03:12:44.569]  There are different phases of this, this invasion on the border and any invasion.
[03:12:44.589 --> 03:12:45.530]  There are always phases.
[03:12:46.570 --> 03:12:50.753]  We're well beyond the first few phases of preparation, initial contact and infiltration.
[03:12:51.153 --> 03:12:52.774]  The infiltration has taken place.
[03:12:53.385 --> 03:13:00.333]  There are approximately 5,000 of these TDA, we'll call them, trend or Aragua individuals in the country right now.
[03:13:01.153 --> 03:13:05.558]  Some of them are coming across pretty easy to identify with tattoos, but others are not.
[03:13:05.598 --> 03:13:06.619]  They're a little more savvy.
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:09.883]  And those savvy ones are the ones that are infiltrating the businesses.
[03:13:09.923 --> 03:13:11.685]  So all the way up to the Red River, we know of
[03:13:12.425 --> 03:13:31.791]  Um, industry that's up there, the trailer manufacturing business up there that is being infiltrated by these Venezuelans who are coming in smooth, wearing suits, paying cash, uh, getting their physicals for, uh, I speak to doctors up there to go to work at these places, but they're, they're setting up the infrastructure for their ability to have what's called access and placement.
[03:13:32.151 --> 03:13:39.674]  They can be now in an area where they have jobs and they will support all these other ones, the actors that do these probing attacks.
[03:13:40.413 --> 03:13:41.714]  And what are probing attacks?
[03:13:41.754 --> 03:13:43.015]  That's in the employment phase.
[03:13:43.435 --> 03:13:45.557]  That's phase six of unconventional warfare, right?
[03:13:45.597 --> 03:13:47.438]  When I'm going to overthrow a country.
[03:13:47.759 --> 03:13:48.779]  There are seven phases.
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:58.767]  And what we do now, what we are doing now, is to try to stave that off, to be left a bang in the mindset before we hit the IED in the road.
[03:13:59.107 --> 03:14:00.929]  We've got to be left a bang on this.
[03:14:01.029 --> 03:14:06.173]  So talk to us about those phases, please, because I think it's really helpful for people to identify
[03:14:06.613 --> 03:14:10.786]  That we're already way past the early stages of unconventional warfare.
[03:14:11.653 --> 03:14:12.053]  Exactly.
[03:14:12.093 --> 03:14:15.775]  So the initial phase is the preparation phase.
[03:14:15.855 --> 03:14:17.036]  It's a PSYOP phase.
[03:14:17.116 --> 03:14:21.478]  It's getting things kind of prepared to create a disenfranchised population.
[03:14:21.998 --> 03:14:23.919]  And we've seen that through the COVID stuff.
[03:14:23.939 --> 03:14:34.964]  We've seen it through the mandates, the pandemic health emergency of international concern and the next international health regulation that's going to shut us down again to allow us to be subservient.
[03:14:35.004 --> 03:14:37.746]  And we're going to then follow exactly what everyone says.
[03:14:37.786 --> 03:14:38.586]  In the meantime,
[03:14:39.184 --> 03:14:44.688]  There's an invasion going on, and the invasion took place over the last three years, and it's just gotten worse.
[03:14:45.029 --> 03:14:46.730]  We saw the numbers go through the ceiling.
[03:14:47.090 --> 03:14:50.573]  A busy day on the border for me three years ago was 12,000 in a week.
[03:14:51.013 --> 03:14:53.735]  That happened on that very night right there, 12,500 in one 24-hour period.
[03:14:53.756 --> 03:14:56.277]  Just prior to that in Del Rio, it was 17,000 with the Haitians.
[03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:22.013]  So, rough actors coming in from third world countries that are being brought in by NGOs, that are being paid for by the Soros types and the Clinton Foundation types and all of those, then being met on this side of the border by the different agencies, which would be the Catholic Charities, HIAC going through the Hebrew organization, going through the Darien Gap.
[03:15:22.373 --> 03:15:24.154]  They are facilitating this invasion.
[03:15:24.614 --> 03:15:29.057]  So then all these things are bringing them in, and that's in phase one, phase two, initial contract.
[03:15:29.137 --> 03:15:30.578]  Phase three is infiltration.
[03:15:31.039 --> 03:15:35.882]  We're down to phase four or five, I'm sorry, five, which is the build-up phase, right?
[03:15:36.162 --> 03:15:37.103]  It's being built up.
[03:15:37.563 --> 03:15:39.044]  And so what happens during that phase?
[03:15:39.344 --> 03:15:45.508]  This is exactly what we're here to talk about, is that in the Permian Basin, and I sent you an article on it, but I'll just explain it.
[03:15:45.869 --> 03:15:48.290]  The Permian Basin is the oil industry of Texas.
[03:15:48.330 --> 03:15:49.571]  It is where all the pumps are.
[03:15:49.611 --> 03:15:51.913]  If you drive through there, it's Midland-Odessa region.
[03:15:52.413 --> 03:15:55.354]  And if you're driving through West Texas, you can see all the pump jacks are going.
[03:15:55.714 --> 03:15:59.015]  You know, they're pumping oil out of the ground and you can see all the oil there.
[03:15:59.136 --> 03:15:59.836]  One second, Doc.
[03:15:59.876 --> 03:16:00.776]  We've got to go to break.
[03:16:00.876 --> 03:16:05.838]  I really want to go back to this on the other side of the break because this is so crucial for people to understand.
[03:16:06.368 --> 03:16:09.650]  And what the next phases are and what we're trying to stop from happening.
[03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:10.271]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:10.311 --> 03:16:11.992]  We're here with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers.
[03:16:12.372 --> 03:16:15.514]  We got a big announcement at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:16:47.721 --> 03:16:49.823]  Just look into all the benefits of collagen folks.
[03:16:49.863 --> 03:16:53.267]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.
[03:16:53.407 --> 03:16:54.988]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[03:16:55.709 --> 03:16:56.990]  Superfood greens.
[03:16:57.050 --> 03:16:57.891]  Are you getting the fiber?
[03:16:57.951 --> 03:16:59.352]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[03:16:59.872 --> 03:17:02.494]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[03:17:02.594 --> 03:17:03.595]  Superfood greens.
[03:17:04.035 --> 03:17:04.976]  Mushroom Macs.
[03:17:05.096 --> 03:17:07.517]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[03:17:07.537 --> 03:17:08.538]  You might not like eating them.
[03:17:08.598 --> 03:17:11.700]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:13.762]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[03:17:15.282 --> 03:17:22.485]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[03:17:22.865 --> 03:17:27.186]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[03:17:27.226 --> 03:17:30.627]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[03:17:30.928 --> 03:17:37.890]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[03:17:39.371 --> 03:17:40.392]  I noticed the difference.
[03:17:40.732 --> 03:17:41.553]  I noticed the difference.
[03:17:41.593 --> 03:17:42.454]  And it's kind of sad.
[03:17:42.474 --> 03:17:44.396]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[03:17:44.716 --> 03:17:46.758]  But that's why turmeric is so important.
[03:17:46.798 --> 03:17:48.059]  Turmeric 95, 25% off.
[03:17:48.279 --> 03:17:50.241]  The prebiotic formula.
[03:17:50.341 --> 03:17:51.522]  The prostate support.
[03:17:51.963 --> 03:17:53.064]  Very important for men.
[03:17:53.584 --> 03:17:54.365]  Nerve Renew.
[03:17:54.605 --> 03:17:55.566]  Joint Max Relief.
[03:17:56.307 --> 03:17:57.328]  Both of those things are key.
[03:17:57.368 --> 03:17:58.469]  And then good night's sleep.
[03:17:58.669 --> 03:18:01.410]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[03:18:01.671 --> 03:18:02.331]  Good night's sleep.
[03:18:02.831 --> 03:18:08.594]  All of these, the InfoWars MD premium supplement line exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:08.674 --> 03:18:09.995]  We appreciate your support there.
[03:18:10.495 --> 03:18:12.296]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[03:18:12.416 --> 03:18:12.876]  Welcome back.
[03:18:12.956 --> 03:18:20.200]  We are here with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, one of the most important people in the country right now, in my opinion, certainly in Texas.
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:23.544]  Because he and his team are doing incredible work.
[03:18:23.644 --> 03:18:33.859]  They are doing border operations, Operation Millstone, which is partnering with the world's leading child rescue teams to bring trafficked children home, and also
[03:18:35.603 --> 03:18:36.684]  Really fast.
[03:18:36.984 --> 03:18:39.606]  This has just exploded their ministry.
[03:18:39.626 --> 03:18:48.612]  The amount of outreach that they're able to do and the amount of support that they are receiving is incredibly well deserved.
[03:18:49.152 --> 03:18:56.457]  Now, I don't know anyone else who has as much intel on what is happening at the border apart from
[03:18:57.057 --> 03:19:00.402]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, maybe my good friend Michael Yon as well.
[03:19:00.542 --> 03:19:06.811]  So these two people are someone that I think every single media outlet in the world should be listening to.
[03:19:06.891 --> 03:19:12.900]  Right before the break he was explaining to us the seven stages of unconventional warfare
[03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:17.651]  And we were interrupted by the break, so please do go on with what you were saying before.
[03:19:17.711 --> 03:19:19.632]  Yeah, and I'd like to add something too.
[03:19:19.712 --> 03:19:24.573]  Todd Bensman is another one to look at and Center for Immigration Studies, a good friend both of Michael and myself.
[03:19:24.953 --> 03:19:28.895]  So he's really the guy that provides us the backside white papers and information.
[03:19:28.915 --> 03:19:30.095]  He's on the ground as well.
[03:19:30.135 --> 03:19:32.776]  So I put a shout out to him too, because it's part of this team.
[03:19:33.716 --> 03:19:35.376]  Not with our team, but as friends.
[03:19:36.357 --> 03:19:37.017]  Understand that
[03:19:38.386 --> 03:19:43.848]  The information that we gave, and I'm going to go back to the phases, the information that we gave is the leadership.
[03:19:44.088 --> 03:19:49.790]  It is the upper level down to the mid-level leadership of the TDA in the United States.
[03:19:50.430 --> 03:19:54.171]  These are very particular documents that have the information on it.
[03:19:54.191 --> 03:20:00.013]  It's as good as, like I said, right around December of last year, but a lot of these guys are still on there.
[03:20:00.033 --> 03:20:04.595]  There's a guy on there right now with a $5 million reward on his head from the Department of State.
[03:20:05.195 --> 03:20:07.496]  So now, if those guys are running these operations,
[03:20:08.143 --> 03:20:08.923]  Who are we going to use?
[03:20:08.943 --> 03:20:11.784]  We're going to use the guys, the nugs on the ground, the thugs.
[03:20:12.525 --> 03:20:13.905]  They've got nothing to lose.
[03:20:14.265 --> 03:20:25.649]  So they're sending them out there and they're going into, during this Phase 5 build-up, Phase 6 employment phases, that's the next before total chaos ensues, which is Phase 7.
[03:20:27.977 --> 03:20:48.093]  When we see these guys out there conducting operations in the employment, what they're doing right now, and as far as all these different stories I have in front of me here, the Permian Basin, the hotels in El Paso, we saw Aurora, Colorado, we know what's going on in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with regard to apartment complexes as well.
[03:20:48.793 --> 03:20:51.174]  These things are probing attacks.
[03:20:51.675 --> 03:21:00.299]  Remember that recently, and you may not have seen this, but recently down in San Antonio area, there was an exchange of gunfire at one of the military bases there.
[03:21:00.719 --> 03:21:01.740]  It was only for a few minutes.
[03:21:01.780 --> 03:21:05.662]  There was only a couple gentlemen that were involved, but they were Venezuelan actors.
[03:21:06.162 --> 03:21:09.524]  We don't know that they're TDA involved, but we have to sort that out.
[03:21:10.264 --> 03:21:27.155]  So, when I'm doing a probing attack, I'm testing your resolve, I'm testing your response times, I'm testing all the things that are required, especially in the Permian Basin with regard to critical infrastructure, especially with military bases with regard to Department of Defense activities.
[03:21:28.176 --> 03:21:29.316]  To see what are you going to do?
[03:21:29.556 --> 03:21:30.677]  How are you going to respond?
[03:21:30.977 --> 03:21:46.788]  So you send in these local low-level thugs, and in this build-ups all the way to employment phase, what's happened is in the Permian Basin, the oil region of Texas, they're driving in there with trucks and stealing diesel fuel, stealing crude oil, stealing copper wire.
[03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:51.311]  These are low-level thug things, but we have to ask ourselves, who else is involved?
[03:21:51.711 --> 03:21:53.753]  And who else is involved as the CCP actors?
[03:21:54.253 --> 03:22:09.100]  So the Chinese Communist Party already has what we believe, and it's been argued between 50,000 and 130,000 actors inside of this country, of which two I've investigated personally on train derailments.
[03:22:09.660 --> 03:22:16.805]  One in East Palestine and then another one in North Carolina, which was attributed to CCP type of activity.
[03:22:17.245 --> 03:22:26.612]  It's unfortunate that the Feds lost those individuals and can't find them, but the local levels did have hands on them until they disappeared.
[03:22:27.172 --> 03:22:32.593]  So, when we see all these things, we have to ask ourselves, who's interested in the critical infrastructure?
[03:22:32.773 --> 03:22:34.073]  Who's interested in the bases?
[03:22:34.613 --> 03:22:49.276]  And we know that CCP has been purchasing properties adjacent to a lot of these military bases with regard to the Strategic Airlift Command and things like that up in the Dakotas and then in the flyover states.
[03:22:49.336 --> 03:22:54.157]  And so, even in Texas, there's an Air Force base down there by Del Rio where a large
[03:22:54.918 --> 03:23:02.346]  Chinese corporation owns a lot of land where they're putting those wind towers in and so we watch that as well because what we're trying to figure out is.
[03:23:02.847 --> 03:23:13.440]  Are there connections between tda and them and that's that's something that we're working on and can't comment on at this time but but just know i'm putting this in your head for a reason because.
[03:23:14.156 --> 03:23:18.997]  Law enforcement's doing their job, but we're going to make sure we stay ahead of them in the sense of left a bang.
[03:23:19.037 --> 03:23:20.557]  We want to get there before the IED.
[03:23:20.877 --> 03:23:22.698]  We don't want a reactionary approach to this.
[03:23:22.738 --> 03:23:23.978]  So that's what we're doing.
[03:23:24.378 --> 03:23:26.978]  Phase 7, that's just transition.
[03:23:27.298 --> 03:23:31.039]  Phase 7 means we're either in total land warfare or we've stopped the action.
[03:23:31.499 --> 03:23:31.979]  One or the other.
[03:23:32.539 --> 03:23:34.360]  And we're right there.
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:37.600]  Well, I'd rather say the latter.
[03:23:38.200 --> 03:23:40.881]  Something that struck me is just unbelievable.
[03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:52.182]  Was Savannah Hernandez actually went to that apartment block in Aurora, Colorado, showing the bullet holes, showing cars without bumpers, no number plates.
[03:23:52.342 --> 03:23:54.183]  It's just absolute chaos.
[03:23:54.823 --> 03:24:00.904]  But then she was met with some people who were apparently saying, oh, no, you know, we're fine.
[03:24:00.944 --> 03:24:02.724]  There's no problems with gangs here.
[03:24:03.145 --> 03:24:05.125]  And then protests proceeded.
[03:24:05.680 --> 03:24:24.036]  Okay, so I just found out something very interesting about the East Colfax Community Collective, that group that put on the migrant protest yesterday.
[03:24:24.596 --> 03:24:32.063]  The one that was trying to change the narrative and say that Trinidad and Tobago is not overrunning that apartment complex that everyone's at and that everyone's been reporting fake news.
[03:24:32.723 --> 03:24:40.029]  Yeah, that organization I found out is funded in large part by the city of Denver and the city of Aurora.
[03:24:40.530 --> 03:24:49.217]  Yes, the same city, the same government officials that have been trying to cover up this story and trying to downplay their migrant crisis.
[03:24:49.895 --> 03:25:04.148]  I found out that the organization yesterday that wrote out all of those signs in English for the migrants and told them, hey, if you don't want to get evicted, you have to talk about not Trinidad and Tobago being in the area, but instead these slumlords.
[03:25:04.168 --> 03:25:05.430]  Let's talk about that instead.
[03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:08.713]  That organization is funded by the city.
[03:25:09.313 --> 03:25:10.094]  Very interesting.
[03:25:10.134 --> 03:25:13.797]  Now I'm also on the ground with Frontline's reporter Jonathan Cho.
[03:25:13.817 --> 03:25:24.786]  He went last night and he spoke to a different migrant who lives in this apartment complex that wasn't a part of that protest yesterday and this man was so frantic trying to pack
[03:25:25.526 --> 03:25:38.196]  Um, because he shares that migrants have been getting extorted, that he specifically has been getting extorted, and that, quote, Mexicans have been going door to door and asking people for money on top of the rent they're already paying.
[03:25:38.656 --> 03:25:40.678]  Alright, we can end it there.
[03:25:40.698 --> 03:25:48.744]  So, apart from the absolute exploitation of these people, the forced labor of children,
[03:25:49.624 --> 03:26:01.734]  The absolute humanitarian crisis that is going on where we are being told in the media that this is somehow, you know, this is for humanitarian efforts that we're letting all of these violent savages into the country.
[03:26:02.154 --> 03:26:17.286]  Apart from all of that, you also have the city allegedly involved in staging protests to pretend to cover up this crime of these violent people taking over the locals there.
[03:26:18.792 --> 03:26:19.913]  You know, that's a great point.
[03:26:19.973 --> 03:26:28.056]  And as let's just put this on to on top of the hotel in El Paso, which was just reported today, actually tweeted out also by Elon today.
[03:26:28.076 --> 03:26:32.398]  And so El Paso has a situation with a hotel specific one.
[03:26:32.419 --> 03:26:35.440]  The last two years, it's received 700 calls for law enforcement.
[03:26:35.940 --> 03:26:39.482]  And the city of El Paso is not coming down on the TDA.
[03:26:39.882 --> 03:26:41.763]  They're coming down on the owners of the hotel.
[03:26:42.432 --> 03:26:44.113]  Right, so that's the same technique.
[03:26:44.514 --> 03:26:45.274]  Let's go after them.
[03:26:45.334 --> 03:26:51.680]  Now, they're not calling them slumlords, but they're basically saying, hey, these are, you know, squatters, they're coming in, there is nothing we can do.
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:56.664]  El Paso is a very, we'll call it, they call it a progressive city.
[03:26:57.424 --> 03:27:04.570]  It was also called by, let's see, Kamala Harris, the only city that she went to when she was border czar, the only one.
[03:27:05.074 --> 03:27:11.707]  Was El Paso when there was no problem in El Paso and she went down there with Nancy Pelosi and they were they use the terms.
[03:27:12.568 --> 03:27:15.594]  This will be the next Ellis Island of the border.
[03:27:15.614 --> 03:27:17.778]  This will be the Ellis Island of the border island.
[03:27:18.337 --> 03:27:25.224]  And so El Paso is now we're seeing over overflowing with with with the illegal trafficking there as well.
[03:27:25.744 --> 03:27:27.406]  So we can't get inside there.
[03:27:27.506 --> 03:27:29.988]  I can't do anything inside of El Paso with our guys.
[03:27:30.068 --> 03:27:39.357]  I mean, we just we're in a non permissive environment with regard to working with law enforcement or anybody for that matter that will be to listen to us.
[03:27:39.437 --> 03:27:41.199]  The rest of the counties that we deal with.
[03:27:41.759 --> 03:27:46.481]  Completely very much open to the information that we give them and any kind of advice.
[03:27:46.761 --> 03:27:53.623]  I speak to emergency operation centers and those things and do classes and teach and prepare them for what is to come.
[03:27:54.183 --> 03:28:01.246]  We don't know what's to come, but I have to still look at everything from a most likely course of action to most dangerous course of action spectrum.
[03:28:01.726 --> 03:28:04.607]  And we want to be prepared for the most dangerous and pray for the most likely.
[03:28:06.215 --> 03:28:06.775]  Absolutely.
[03:28:06.835 --> 03:28:10.898]  Tim, if you can bring up the injunction, the Gateway Hotel injunction.
[03:28:10.918 --> 03:28:22.786]  So for a little bit of background of what Lieutenant Colonel Chambers was just discussing, Gateway Hotel is facing legal action over the alleged trend of Aragua activity with violations.
[03:28:22.826 --> 03:28:27.450]  So what's happened is that there's been an injunction issued on the hotel
[03:28:28.535 --> 03:28:35.107]  And this is, of course, because for the last two years, as you said, there have been close to 700 calls made for police to investigate the hotel.
[03:28:35.127 --> 03:28:40.717]  This is actually the one that I was talking about where you've got people wielding, you know, machetes or whatnot, hatchets.
[03:28:41.548 --> 03:28:45.933]  Um, partying on the third floor, some with guns drawn, so on and so forth.
[03:28:45.973 --> 03:28:50.938]  Well, yes, men holding knives, hatchets, assaulting people with hatchets.
[03:28:50.958 --> 03:28:52.559]  You can see some of that footage from the hotel.
[03:28:52.599 --> 03:28:53.720]  This is just daily life.
[03:28:54.121 --> 03:29:00.067]  And instead of the also suspected prostitution, I should add, but instead of the government,
[03:29:00.620 --> 03:29:00.800]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:31.281]  All right.
[03:29:49.580 --> 03:29:53.563]  Biometrics, things that would be required in order to find somebody.
[03:29:53.884 --> 03:29:54.844]  This is a network.
[03:29:54.945 --> 03:30:01.670]  It's basically a network that has been created over time, and we were able to come into possession of it.
[03:30:02.050 --> 03:30:04.913]  And it was, like I said, pretty accurate as of December.
[03:30:05.674 --> 03:30:09.138]  Uh, and then when we handed it over in February, we added a few more documents that came in.
[03:30:09.459 --> 03:30:11.301]  We're still receiving information for people.
[03:30:11.341 --> 03:30:15.927]  This is open source reporting as much like a journalist or a correspondent would do.
[03:30:16.769 --> 03:30:20.594]  Just relationships on the ground, people telling us things and then giving us things.
[03:30:21.094 --> 03:30:34.791]  Now, this is the Army North document that you're looking at now, and it talks about some of the things that we would look at with regard to the, I'm going to just say the thugs on the ground, but the ones that come in in suits, you're not going to be able to identify them at all.
[03:30:35.371 --> 03:30:36.313]  They're smooth talkers.
[03:30:36.353 --> 03:30:37.434]  They're the ones that are leadership.
[03:30:37.474 --> 03:30:39.857]  Those are the ones in those documents that we've got.
[03:30:40.357 --> 03:30:41.818]  And so we're able to identify them.
[03:30:41.878 --> 03:30:47.181]  So there are law enforcement agents that are working on these things, officials that are working on these things.
[03:30:47.641 --> 03:30:51.463]  But sometimes when you hand it to them and they just kind of look at you like, oh, yeah, we'll get to this whenever.
[03:30:52.123 --> 03:30:55.625]  Those of us that know what war looks like and knows what infiltration looks like.
[03:30:56.255 --> 03:30:58.596]  We're trying to tell them, look, this is coming.
[03:30:58.857 --> 03:30:59.457]  This is coming.
[03:30:59.477 --> 03:31:01.138]  You need to start listening to us.
[03:31:01.578 --> 03:31:02.619]  And perhaps they will.
[03:31:03.059 --> 03:31:04.019]  But many of them don't.
[03:31:04.840 --> 03:31:07.802]  Because it's just too easy just to respond to things.
[03:31:07.842 --> 03:31:09.443]  And they might get a little rest here and there.
[03:31:09.923 --> 03:31:12.184]  But that's not going to stop this type of activity.
[03:31:12.224 --> 03:31:13.605]  Because they are emboldened.
[03:31:14.205 --> 03:31:25.412]  While we are watching these armed illegal alien gangs posing threats to critical energy infrastructure, which is what I'm talking about, that's a larger target set.
[03:31:26.818 --> 03:31:30.261]  The nation is sleepwalking in a disaster, as far as I'm concerned.
[03:31:30.281 --> 03:31:31.422]  They're sleepwalking right into it.
[03:31:32.523 --> 03:31:45.415]  So one of the potential uses of these people, because we've just witnessed from Savannah Hernandez evidence that there is potentially, you know, support from the city for these gangs, for these groups.
[03:31:46.542 --> 03:32:01.968]  And so, you know, we're witnessing the, I can't find the word that I'm looking for, the enabling, the enabling of these groups to continue, which means that perhaps there are people in power
[03:32:02.688 --> 03:32:08.613]  And I dare say there would be, that are actually preparing on utilising these people for some of the things that you're talking about.
[03:32:08.834 --> 03:32:18.201]  Alex just in, I can't remember whether it was the last hour or the hour before, was talking about, you know, MAGA Republicans are going to attack critical infrastructure.
[03:32:18.221 --> 03:32:25.968]  Okay, well we know that we have these guys, TDA, going in and actually doing something with critical infrastructure.
[03:32:26.968 --> 03:32:32.550]  So it's not going to be MAGA Republicans, but the fact that the media is setting that up means they may know something's coming.
[03:32:32.610 --> 03:32:35.071]  So where could this lead, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers?
[03:32:35.471 --> 03:32:35.731]  Right.
[03:32:35.851 --> 03:32:38.152]  So you just got that document you just showed just now.
[03:32:38.412 --> 03:32:43.194]  It corroborates the 17 August 24, 0200 hours individuals fighting rounds.
[03:32:43.594 --> 03:32:45.355]  These are probing attacks that I was talking about.
[03:32:45.835 --> 03:32:47.056]  And so where does this lead?
[03:32:47.076 --> 03:32:48.997]  This leads to a false flag.
[03:32:49.117 --> 03:32:50.538]  This is a potential for a false flag.
[03:32:50.578 --> 03:32:57.783]  It would be something that has been done over and over and over again, is to commit the crime and then blame the crime on somebody else.
[03:32:57.823 --> 03:33:02.946]  But those individuals in their positions of authority have an oath of office, and there is a constitution.
[03:33:03.206 --> 03:33:10.511]  We have declared an emergency at the border, the governor did, and into the constitution of both the state and federal constitution.
[03:33:11.733 --> 03:33:15.784]  You're in violation of that, and if you took an oath for that, that's now called treason.
[03:33:16.357 --> 03:33:22.199]  Which, if it's done intentionally, could be argued in court and it would be punishable by death in a time of war.
[03:33:22.739 --> 03:33:26.440]  So, these are very serious allegations, but these are very serious times.
[03:33:26.881 --> 03:33:33.383]  And so we need to make sure that those people understand that, that they are aiding and abetting an enemy force.
[03:33:33.783 --> 03:33:34.923]  And this is an enemy force.
[03:33:35.343 --> 03:33:40.965]  They may not be armed like we think, you know, the typical uniform coming into the country with a flag on your shoulder.
[03:33:41.886 --> 03:33:44.066]  But this is unconventional warfare 101.
[03:33:44.106 --> 03:33:44.847]  There's no doubt.
[03:33:46.420 --> 03:33:46.760]  No doubt.
[03:33:46.780 --> 03:33:54.665]  I want to be clear as well, and maybe you can elaborate on this, that it's not just TDA that we have to be concerned about here.
[03:33:54.925 --> 03:34:00.848]  This is just one that's particularly come to light recently because they're now taking over people's residential buildings.
[03:34:01.928 --> 03:34:03.990]  So talk to us about some of the other gangs.
[03:34:04.030 --> 03:34:10.073]  I understand these guys are very dangerous, but some of the other gangs and what their focus has been.
[03:34:10.908 --> 03:34:18.611]  Well, you know, some of the other gangs have kind of corroborated together in this whole scheme for, you know, the fentanyl thing.
[03:34:18.952 --> 03:34:25.234]  Definitely they make a lot of money, but the human trafficking is where they can sell someone over and over and over again.
[03:34:25.254 --> 03:34:35.039]  So this whole market that's come across the border, these rat lines, as we call them, these infiltration routes are now being taken over by the human trafficking people.
[03:34:35.639 --> 03:34:53.664]  And also in the chaos, which is, this is chaos when you see the border, you know, if you, if you came on the border one night with me and watched a thousand people cross at one point at night, and then you knew that a mile or up or down the river, they were coming across with guns or they were coming across with humans that were going to be traffic in a different sort of way.
[03:34:54.764 --> 03:34:57.985]  You would see that this is, this is a game of cat and mouse, right?
[03:34:58.005 --> 03:35:00.386]  And that was really on the small scale when we were down there.
[03:35:00.966 --> 03:35:04.208]  Now, in this time, it's out of control.
[03:35:04.468 --> 03:35:06.369]  The numbers make it impossible.
[03:35:06.389 --> 03:35:07.849]  Looking for a needle in a stack of needles.
[03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:10.590]  So then I can bring in those bad actors.
[03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:12.071]  I can also come up the waterways.
[03:35:12.091 --> 03:35:13.752]  That's something else that hasn't been looked at.
[03:35:14.372 --> 03:35:17.473]  Nobody looks at barges and what comes in those connexes and those barges.
[03:35:17.894 --> 03:35:19.995]  Very few of those are investigated or looked at.
[03:35:20.395 --> 03:35:27.658]  The Mississippi River that comes in and feeds into the Tennessee River and some of these other rivers, the Illinois and all these other rivers that come up the center part of the country,
[03:35:28.198 --> 03:35:34.002]  Those barges carry huge, huge platforms of connexes, which can carry weapons.
[03:35:34.042 --> 03:35:54.715]  We've got to start looking at that stuff, because if I then arm these people that are in the country, and when you ask which gangs, which organizations, we're looking at everything from the Yemeni types, you know, the jihadist types down in the Middle East that have come in, 150 countries that have come across this border are being documented.
[03:35:55.531 --> 03:35:57.212]  Then you see the MS-13.
[03:35:57.472 --> 03:35:59.033]  They've been in this country for a long time.
[03:35:59.333 --> 03:36:04.856]  You see the CDN and CNJG, the new generation, the Nuevo generation.
[03:36:05.977 --> 03:36:13.140]  Those are right there on the border, but they're well, well ensconced way up on the egress and ingress highways.
[03:36:13.201 --> 03:36:17.503]  So it'd be Highway 35 coming up the center of the country, Highway 40 going east and west.
[03:36:17.923 --> 03:36:19.604]  All along the way there, they have depots.
[03:36:19.624 --> 03:36:22.706]  They have places where they are strongly
[03:36:24.332 --> 03:36:35.619]  Entrenched into the cities to be like places like Oklahoma City or in Arkansas is completely on Highway 40, completely owned by those different gangs.
[03:36:35.639 --> 03:36:39.502]  But they've been here for a while, so they're not really looking at them anymore.
[03:36:39.582 --> 03:36:41.663]  Those guys have their systems and they've been running it.
[03:36:42.163 --> 03:37:03.799]  The ones that I worry about for me are the CCP actors, because those guys are in it for the long game, and they're going to stay undercover for a long time until these probing attacks by these thugs are done, and they're going to watch, and they're going to see, and they're going to measure three, four times before they launch any sort of buildup into then a phase seven attack.
[03:37:04.319 --> 03:37:10.163]  And that's just the way that's done, because they have to ensure that they have the follow-on attacks to come.
[03:37:10.523 --> 03:37:27.615]  So this would look like, let's say, for example, hitting a critical infrastructure, knocking out a power grid, and then in the chaos, then, allowing something like that to come across either the border or from the northern border as well, which few people don't realize, the Chinese national, I mean, the CCP trains in Canada.
[03:37:28.015 --> 03:37:28.776]  They train up there.
[03:37:29.258 --> 03:37:36.281]  So you're going to have trucks on the ground that are already, you know, I don't know how many, I don't have the intelligence on that, but I know that they're training up there.
[03:37:36.321 --> 03:37:39.022]  They have operations they do together with the Canadian Army.
[03:37:39.482 --> 03:37:42.683]  So that being said, I would be looking for that as well.
[03:37:43.203 --> 03:37:45.684]  And that is something we do pay attention to.
[03:37:45.704 --> 03:37:55.008]  It is absolutely clear that there is an all out assault on the United States that should be clear to everyone everywhere in the world.
[03:37:55.638 --> 03:37:59.881]  And even more so the people of this world, of this nation.
[03:38:01.222 --> 03:38:08.446]  Now is such a critical time for the US and I don't think that people can wait until it hits their towns.
[03:38:08.606 --> 03:38:12.769]  And I know that you certainly didn't wait until it hit people's towns.
[03:38:12.829 --> 03:38:15.411]  You've given this to officials in February.
[03:38:15.451 --> 03:38:19.433]  So I want to know, what are we hoping to achieve here?
[03:38:21.181 --> 03:38:26.423]  I suppose we have a lot of information that could be made public if there is inaction.
[03:38:26.683 --> 03:38:28.063]  Am I right in my assumption?
[03:38:28.163 --> 03:38:28.643]  Absolutely.
[03:38:29.043 --> 03:38:30.104]  Maria, you're absolutely right.
[03:38:30.124 --> 03:38:41.247]  This will be made public because what I do is what we do, and it's not just us, not just our team, this alliance of teams across the nation, is we kind of have to sometimes
[03:38:41.827 --> 03:38:51.817]  Force the hand a little bit of the ones that might be sitting on it because if they don't do something It's kind of like lead follow or get out of the way If you're not going to do it, then we find somebody that will do it
[03:38:52.375 --> 03:38:54.336]  All right, we can't take it to the Department of Justice.
[03:38:54.376 --> 03:38:54.997]  What are they going to do?
[03:38:55.297 --> 03:38:56.417]  What have they proven to us?
[03:38:56.577 --> 03:38:57.958]  Nothing in this regard.
[03:38:58.258 --> 03:38:59.499]  This is what they should be doing.
[03:38:59.539 --> 03:39:01.160]  It's coming across international lines.
[03:39:02.401 --> 03:39:03.621]  They've not touched any of this.
[03:39:04.062 --> 03:39:09.405]  When I deal with FBI people, when I was in uniform, their addition to things was very minimal.
[03:39:09.425 --> 03:39:16.849]  They were worried about white extremism or, you know, the people providing sandwiches on the border.
[03:39:16.869 --> 03:39:18.450]  Or someone's Facebook post being offensive.
[03:39:18.730 --> 03:39:18.890]  Yeah.
[03:39:19.665 --> 03:39:20.245]  Right, right.
[03:39:20.285 --> 03:39:21.546]  Yeah, it was never a help.
[03:39:21.606 --> 03:39:25.867]  So for us, it's making sure that we get the information to the right ones.
[03:39:26.248 --> 03:39:33.611]  It will come very quickly now that this information will come out and that way every person can be out there on alert and see these individuals.
[03:39:33.931 --> 03:39:34.531]  Hey, why not?
[03:39:34.571 --> 03:39:38.172]  You know, go after the guy that's got the $5 million reward on his head and roll him up.
[03:39:38.853 --> 03:39:41.494]  You know, if you're a law enforcement agent, you could use the money.
[03:39:41.534 --> 03:39:42.254]  We need your help.
[03:39:42.954 --> 03:39:44.195]  That's what we're trying to say here.
[03:39:44.255 --> 03:39:46.057]  We tried the normal channels.
[03:39:46.797 --> 03:39:47.798]  It didn't go fast enough.
[03:39:48.098 --> 03:39:49.799]  We're watching their increase, right?
[03:39:50.880 --> 03:39:51.681]  It's exponential.
[03:39:52.361 --> 03:39:53.282]  Just TDA alone.
[03:39:53.877 --> 03:39:56.519]  But the other stuff that's in the shadows is what really concerns me.
[03:39:56.999 --> 03:40:00.021]  Because that stuff is loud, and it's in your face, and it's in the media.
[03:40:00.421 --> 03:40:02.382]  But I never fall for that trick.
[03:40:02.442 --> 03:40:02.842]  I don't.
[03:40:02.902 --> 03:40:03.503]  I never have.
[03:40:03.843 --> 03:40:07.665]  The one time I did in 2004, my truck was blown up by an ID.
[03:40:07.946 --> 03:40:13.629]  I've learned since then to pay attention to the periphery and not get suckered into something that will blow you up.
[03:40:15.293 --> 03:40:16.093]  It's such a good point.
[03:40:16.374 --> 03:40:23.738]  We're almost out of time today, but team, if you can bring up the remnant ministry tx.org up on screen, scroll down a little bit.
[03:40:24.578 --> 03:40:31.822]  Doc, if you can just spend the next minute or so talking about your missions further on down the page, the border operations, the Operation Millstone.
[03:40:33.266 --> 03:40:36.608]  So these things grew out of just, you know, a bunch of guys going to the border.
[03:40:36.628 --> 03:40:39.069]  It was just me and that dog right there and my horse originally.
[03:40:39.649 --> 03:40:45.372]  And then we found this think tank, which is Colonel Phil Waldron.
[03:40:45.412 --> 03:40:46.272]  This is his place.
[03:40:46.812 --> 03:40:51.955]  He's been out there a lot working on a lot of the election integrity stuff, but he's given us a home.
[03:40:52.535 --> 03:40:53.195]  We're good to go!
[03:41:14.003 --> 03:41:14.583]  We are a ministry.
[03:41:14.603 --> 03:41:15.844]  We're advancing the kingdom of God.
[03:41:16.605 --> 03:41:21.448]  We are doing community service, and ministry equals service, and that's what that word means.
[03:41:21.848 --> 03:41:37.477]  So we are servants in the service of Christ, our Lord and Savior, and we believe that, and we pray that we don't have to put on our body armor and weapons again, but should it be required, you know, like Operation Nehemiah, we also have that one going on.
[03:41:38.077 --> 03:41:42.360]  That's where Nehemiah built a wall with a shovel in one hand and a sword in the other.
[03:41:43.757 --> 03:41:46.138]  Well, I just want to encourage anyone who can support.
[03:41:46.178 --> 03:41:52.161]  Again, that website is the remnantministrytx.org.
[03:41:52.201 --> 03:41:58.084]  You can also follow Lieutenant Colonel Chambers on xdocpeachambers at docpeachambers.
[03:41:58.584 --> 03:41:59.885]  Really appreciate your time today.
[03:41:59.905 --> 03:42:03.927]  For the people that aren't able to get out there physically, please support the people who can.
[03:42:04.557 --> 03:42:15.686]  Uh, because what this, what this entire discussion has been is the pressure that needs to be applied to these officials that have the information that's been gathered by units like DOCS.
[03:42:16.246 --> 03:42:21.350]  Uh, and, uh, and, and we can, we can absolutely not reach the catastrophic
[03:42:21.790 --> 03:42:23.012]  Thank you so much.
[03:42:37.321 --> 03:42:38.722]  Thank you for what you're doing, Maria, as well.
[03:42:39.342 --> 03:42:39.842]  God bless you.
[03:42:40.263 --> 03:42:46.025]  COVID vax causes more heart damage than COVID virus and brain, blood, immune, cancer, reproductive study.
[03:42:46.366 --> 03:42:47.286]  I mean, there's so many studies.
[03:42:47.306 --> 03:42:47.866]  What do you make of that?
[03:42:47.906 --> 03:42:49.967]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[03:42:50.288 --> 03:42:56.071]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[03:42:56.451 --> 03:42:57.951]  It's a government false narrative.
[03:42:57.992 --> 03:43:03.875]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[03:43:04.055 --> 03:43:04.715]  It doesn't.
[03:43:04.955 --> 03:43:06.957]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[03:43:06.977 --> 03:43:08.878]  When you follow the article, there's no link, there's no proof.
[03:43:08.918 --> 03:43:14.542]  It just says, COVID'S A GREATER RISK OF HEART PROBLEMS THAN THE SHOT, and they just lie.
[03:43:14.942 --> 03:43:20.907]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC.
[03:43:21.807 --> 03:43:25.368]  The NIH, this is a false narrative.
[03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:29.210]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[03:43:29.250 --> 03:43:30.370]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:33.371]  But the vaccine, we are... I'm a cardiologist, Alex.
[03:43:33.492 --> 03:43:37.613]  I am knee-deep in people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure.
[03:43:37.853 --> 03:43:41.074]  The vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and some.
[03:43:41.094 --> 03:43:44.876]  It's inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[03:43:45.456 --> 03:43:47.337]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart.
[03:43:47.397 --> 03:43:47.958]  Another study.
[03:43:48.338 --> 03:43:53.901]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[03:43:53.961 --> 03:44:00.485]  It's very important for people to realize they may not feel chest pain initially, but then they have the onset of effort intolerance,
[03:44:01.025 --> 03:44:04.448]  A pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[03:44:04.489 --> 03:44:05.910]  I have cases from Austin, Alex.
[03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:07.431]  Referred up to my office.
[03:44:07.752 --> 03:44:10.014]  It's vaccine myocarditis and heart failure.
[03:44:10.394 --> 03:44:11.635]  They need treatment for this.
[03:44:11.956 --> 03:44:16.560]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements.
[03:44:16.900 --> 03:44:19.763]  Available through onlinehealthnow.com.
[03:44:21.244 --> 03:44:30.407]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[03:44:30.567 --> 03:44:39.631]  Now I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, as bad as taking the shots,
[03:44:40.595 --> 03:44:57.294]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published, you have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[03:44:57.694 --> 03:45:00.818]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[03:45:01.118 --> 03:45:05.360]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[03:45:05.520 --> 03:45:13.443]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[03:45:13.783 --> 03:45:15.204]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[03:45:15.504 --> 03:45:19.026]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[03:45:19.046 --> 03:45:24.768]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this, very good support for doing this.
[03:45:25.208 --> 03:45:26.369]  It's natokinase.
[03:45:26.849 --> 03:45:30.010]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:31.151]  Japanese discovered it.
[03:45:31.731 --> 03:45:35.352]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[03:45:35.772 --> 03:45:39.333]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[03:45:39.373 --> 03:45:41.074]  These are all in capsule format.
[03:45:41.394 --> 03:45:43.855]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[03:45:44.175 --> 03:45:46.056]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[03:45:46.156 --> 03:45:49.097]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[03:45:49.437 --> 03:45:50.158]  So you build up?
[03:45:50.498 --> 03:45:51.219]  And we build up.
[03:45:51.259 --> 03:45:55.182]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[03:45:55.222 --> 03:45:57.384]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[03:45:57.624 --> 03:45:59.605]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners.
[03:45:59.866 --> 03:46:03.088]  And we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:07.072]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[03:46:07.272 --> 03:46:08.273]  They don't dissolve them.
[03:46:08.533 --> 03:46:11.295]  We actually have to give thrombolytic enzymes.
[03:46:11.535 --> 03:46:14.498]  That's McCullough protocol based by protein detoxification.
[03:46:14.858 --> 03:46:18.739]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[03:46:19.039 --> 03:46:20.119]  That's the go-to place.
[03:46:20.139 --> 03:46:25.440]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:29.061]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase, but five minor ingredients.
[03:46:29.281 --> 03:46:36.543]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
