[00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, November 20th, 2024.
[00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.370]  I'm Alex Jones coming here from the recaptured Infowars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.700]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.299]  Almost three years ago, I began playing air raid sirens every day on the broadcast.
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.460]  I've been on air 30 plus years, only really started doing that recently.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.659]  Maybe I'd play air raid sirens once a year when something was particularly dangerous militarily.
[00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.380]  But now I play them every day, but I can play you air raid sirens from Russia, from Ukraine.
[00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.700]  I can play you it happening today and crowds running through the streets.
[00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:10.579]  That's because World War III has begun.
[00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.359]  You can take this date, Wednesday, November 20th, 2024.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.599]  You won't hear that anywhere else unless you read the doctrine of NATO and the United States and the UK and Russia and China.
[00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.489]  And Putin said two months ago, he said if you deliver the missiles, we will be officially at war with NATO. And he said if you launch them, we reserve the right to counter-strike with nuclear weapons.
[00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:40.870]  Yesterday, he officially said that doctrine is in place now.
[00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.269]  The United States has a first-strike doctrine as well.
[00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.980]  So that's where we are.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.420]  And General Flynn and Congressman Massey and myself and others are saying, you got to remove Biden's 25th Amendment or impeach him.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.219]  People said, well, we'll get Kamala.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.260]  Well, we'll impeach her too.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.420]  The message is, whoever's in control, those people are puppets.
[00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.620]  We're going to impeach Blinken.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.239]  We're going to impeach the CIA director.
[00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.259]  We're going to impeach the Secretary of Defense.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.539]  We're going to remove these people until they stop bombing Russia and call for a ceasefire.
[00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.830]  Which Russia has wanted since day one.
[00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.370]  They just want a deal to not move NATO weapons to their borders, which has already been done and has now been massively escalated.
[00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.009]  The West started this by overthrowing the Ukrainian government 14 years ago.
[00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.310]  It's been intensifying since then.
[00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:42.449]  And coming up in February 20th, it'll be three years since the war massively escalated with the full Russian invasion, the special military operation, as they call it.
[00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.009]  So, the U.S. says eight attackums, not six, were fired into Russia in the middle of the night.
[00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:56.430]  Now, two days ago, Russia time.
[00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.509]  Day and a half ago, our time.
[00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:04.810]  And now a few hours ago, they're saying 12, they're saying 18, they're saying 20.
[00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:13.370]  Similar heavy cruise missiles that can be nuclear retrofitted, or the primary mission is that, so they're retrofitted with...
[00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:23.270]  Conventional explosives now can be loaded with hydrogen bombs, and then you launch those as a sneak attack to take out the Russians ahead of a full nuclear attack.
[00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:35.909]  So it's a nuclear sneak attack move, and so the Russians have said, if just some of these missiles come in, we're going to start hitting NATO targets in NATO countries with conventional weapons.
[00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.650]  But if we see a large aerospace...
[00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.669]  Movement of a bunch of aircraft and missiles at once.
[00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.550]  We will take it as a massive attack.
[00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.409]  So would the United States.
[00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.210]  So would anybody else.
[00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.750]  That's the quote from Putin yesterday and two months ago.
[00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.509]  That they see a large aerospace movement.
[00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:55.710]  A bunch of missiles.
[00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.669]  They have to believe they're not taking out military targets with conventional weapons.
[00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.930]  They will believe that is a decapitation attack with a bunch of nukes coming at them.
[00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.770]  And they will start firing nuclear weapons.
[00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:21.089]  Cruise missiles, bombs, ballistic missiles, nuclear artillery, what you'd call tactical.
[00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.689]  So this is the greatest military escalation in history.
[00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.209]  This is worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis by far because we didn't have insane leadership then.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.160]  And I don't even have words to describe to you how incredibly dangerous this is.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.279]  I don't think you need me to tell you that.
[00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.680]  But I'm going to explain why World War III has begun.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.160]  That doesn't mean nuclear World War III. It means World War III. Guaranteed you'll be hearing this soon.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.639]  But I'm saying it first.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.660]  It's like we called Trump the winner first on election night.
[00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.560]  World War III has officially begun, according to the doctrine.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.860]  I'll explain when we come back.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.579]  It is Wednesday, November 20th, 2024.
[00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:06.670]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.829]  I want to thank you for joining us on this emergency broadcast.
[00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:33.430]  Alright, let me just be very calm about this, and I'm going to say this first, and no major think tank, no major government has yet said this, but I guarantee you that within 24 hours you will see this headline everywhere.
[00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.139]  And you tune in here for tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:52.339]  I've studied the doctrines of Russia, China, NATO countries, the United States, the particular nuclear doctrines of the nuclear powers within NATO, like France, the UK, and others.
[00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:02.300]  And I can tell you unequivocally, 100%, we are in World War III. And you can say today...
[00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:20.750]  Hours ago, when the UK fired between 12 and 20, and reportedly there's more, so that's why it's growing, high-powered supersonic cruise missiles out of Ukraine into Russia at military targets.
[00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:32.529]  Now, I did not say World War III had begun yesterday in the early morning hours in Russia.
[00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:45.199]  When the United States launched, the U.S. says eight army attackums.
[00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.720]  Very similar to the storm shadow.
[00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:50.759]  Now why did I say that?
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:21.569]  Because if Biden and whoever's in control up there could be dialed back, if sanity could prevail like they did two months ago when Biden said he was going to do it, but then he talked to his advisors and decided not to, If they could get the phone calls between the Russian president and the American government and whoever's in
[00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:25.329]  charge, Blinken and others, then this could be dialed back.
[00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:47.399]  But I said if other NATO countries who've all got their own missiles that are their designs, and there's At least nine different missile systems that are in the same range and class as the storm shadows that the UK deployed and the ATACMS that the United States deployed,
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:56.829]  that if other NATO countries join in In bombing Russia, which happened today.
[00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:57.730]  The UK joined.
[00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:59.589]  It is official.
[00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.350]  They're going ahead.
[00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:21.810]  And Russia and Putin and their head of their missile forces and Lavrov, their foreign minister, have all said two months ago in public announcements and in speeches and in doctrinal changes to their military posture and their nuclear forces that if the missiles were delivered And that if the West said,
[00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:33.570]  we are now escalating, just the announcement would mean Russia was, quote, in a state of war officially with NATO. And I'll show you all those articles again.
[00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.389]  We can pull up the CNN article.
[00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.090]  We can show you the Putin videos.
[00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.090]  This is on record.
[00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.029]  Now, what is the Speaker of the House doing?
[00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.149]  He's involved in this.
[00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.169]  He needs to be called on the carpet by Trump.
[00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:48.889]  This needs to be de-escalated now.
[00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:51.700]  It is the Speaker of the House.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.840]  It is the Leader of the Senate.
[00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.559]  Chuck Schumer.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.019]  It is the CIA. It is the State Department.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.019]  It is the Pentagon.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.299]  They have made this decision, and there it is.
[00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:11.200]  Russia will be at war with NATO if Ukraine long-range missile restrictions lifted Putin warrants.
[00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:15.820]  I'm just waiting for my headlines at Real Alex Jones to...
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:29.019]  We fact-checked, and they'll use a NATO statement, I'm predicting, and say NATO says they are not at war with Russia, and NATO says that there is a war between Ukraine and Russia.
[00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:34.240]  And I guess the same fact-checkers would say two men can have a baby, and there's no X-men like chromosome.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.899]  See, the difference with this show is, and why they admit at the State Department and congressional hearings they want me off the air is...
[00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:41.570]  I study.
[00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.470]  I do my own research.
[00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.610]  I talk to all the experts.
[00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.610]  I'm an expert in a lot of general fields.
[00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:54.330]  And when I decide something is something, when I decide historically we've reached the threshold, I will tell you my view.
[00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.889]  And when it's my view, I will tell you it is my analysis and my approximation.
[00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.990]  And I'm almost always right, as you know.
[00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:09.629]  When I'm sure of something, I will tell you it is a fact.
[00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:27.289]  That by the doctrines of NATO and NATO member nations, that I've looked at all of them, and by the doctrine of Russia and the doctrine of China, with another NATO country joining in a major bombing operation against Russia,
[00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:33.009]  Russia, I guarantee you, and they even said this, was waiting to see if this continued.
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:47.019]  I guarantee you, when these missiles rained down a few hours ago, that they are in bunkers in Russia with their high command, and they are saying, we are now officially at war.
[00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:55.679]  I bet you my life that they have said, we are now officially at war and are deciding what to do.
[00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:57.860]  So, this is how escalation works.
[00:10:58.179 --> 00:10:59.440]  A shadow war.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.580]  Overthrow the government.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.639]  Have a proxy war for 14 years with the Russians.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.720]  NATO, Russian troops battling for the last six, seven years.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.179]  The Russians take over Crimea.
[00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.200]  More weapons get rolled in up against the border.
[00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:15.059]  Russia goes in to push those weapons out.
[00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:18.279]  Says, don't join NATO. Get your long-range weapons out.
[00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:22.379]  We don't like missiles being brought in that can take out our nuclear forces in a sneak attack.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.980]  We don't want to invade.
[00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:25.779]  This is the final red line.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.840]  You've gone over dozens of our red lines.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.740]  This is the final red line.
[00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:33.580]  And NATO said in communiques that are public, we don't believe it.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.440]  Keep doing it.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.539]  Encircling Russia.
[00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:38.840]  And that's the same thing.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.100]  Oh, look, we bombed Russia yesterday.
[00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.259]  They didn't nuke us.
[00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:46.019]  I saw that all over the news, all over X, people laughing at me.
[00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:49.080]  Oh, Alex, you said this could cause a nuclear war and escalation.
[00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:50.620]  Russia didn't do anything.
[00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:51.120]  See.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.840]  And so you're playing with the end of the world.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.740]  So when I say World War III has begun, it has.
[00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:11.700]  A world war is multiple superpowers, major power blocks in multiple regions of the world in conflict.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.980]  And I'll explain in a moment the multiple regions.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.820]  And the defense treaties.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.799]  Now that doesn't mean nuclear war.
[00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:29.259]  People associate a third world war with nuclear exchanges.
[00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:38.129]  And you should, because that's where almost all the models, in fact, all the models lead in the escalation on the threat continuum.
[00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:41.370]  And I'll go over the Pentagon documents in a moment from them explaining it to you.
[00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:51.730]  So, yes, we are on a fast track to thermal nuclear war, and in every model, it is not a limited exchange between nuclear powers.
[00:12:52.149 --> 00:13:00.129]  It can be a limited exchange if the Japanese don't have them, and you drop them on them in 1945 out of the Enola Gay little boy and fat man.
[00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:07.330]  So, the world is now in a world war.
[00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.210]  Let me explain why.
[00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:22.110]  China, North Korea, And Iran have public defense treaties and mutual aid treaties with Russia.
[00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:30.730]  A month ago, North Korea blew up its bridges and railways to South Korea and said, we are preparing for total war.
[00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:36.309]  China has been supplying weapons and advisors.
[00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.470]  Now, it's clear the North Korean troops are in Ukraine.
[00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:44.990]  Not just on the border in Kursk.
[00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.870]  The Russians have said, we don't believe even if Trump gets in, he can stop this.
[00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.590]  We hope, but we're not counting on that.
[00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.730]  We're preparing for full nuclear war.
[00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:02.190]  We've now targeted the NATO sites we're going to hit with nuclear weapons.
[00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:08.470]  We've changed the doctrine, and we told you, you started this, and so next you're going to get nuked.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.919]  They debated whether they would blow up a major military base for the nuke in a NATO country.
[00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:23.000]  But the Russians said, and I'll show you the articles in a moment, they said, we haven't talked to your government in years.
[00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:24.159]  Nobody calls us.
[00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.379]  The hotline's not activated.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.960]  We'll put those articles on screen.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.799]  And I'm going to walk through all this, but I'm giving you the basics right now.
[00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.690]  Everything I'm saying, I'll show you a clip, I'll show you a document, I'll show you a Pentagon document, I'll go through it all, but I'll give you the big picture right now.
[00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:44.070]  Now let's go to the most important part that I haven't talked enough about.
[00:14:45.009 --> 00:15:00.600]  China, North Korea, Iran all have defense agreements And so, as soon as the Russians call the Chinese and call the Iranians and call the North Koreans, which they've already basically said, hey, the state of war is already here,
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.440]  but we haven't announced full mobilization yet, and we hope they back down.
[00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:06.700]  This is so insane, but we're actually in...
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.039]  Months ago, at least a month ago, World War III had begun.
[00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:16.600]  But now, officially, there's not a pullback...
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.740]  And these countries that we're now at war with believe it's going to go to full war.
[00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.559]  So, World War III started about a month ago.
[00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.659]  It's officially now here.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.539]  The question is, will it escalate more and will it go nuclear?
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.340]  And if it continues on, it will.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.720]  And there's Reuters.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.740]  You can read the full article.
[00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:40.220]  We've got photos and videos of the situation.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.659]  Red phone.
[00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:42.399]  It's not a red phone.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.179]  It's a big video screen room where you talk to world leaders and...
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:55.100]  Trump is criticized for talking to Putin and Elon Musk is because you're not supposed to talk to the biggest nuclear power in the world.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320]  You're just supposed to bomb them.
[00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:04.580]  That's how you have security while you're dissolving your borders and kidnapping and smuggling children for sex slavery.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.279]  So that's who we've got running the West.
[00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:47.620]  So China is now the main suspect cutting these cables in the Baltic Sea so that there's not communications between groups allied with NATO like Finland and the other European countries and the Chinese ship Was over both the
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.240]  cables that are far flung.
[00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.620]  And that's another sign of what's happening.
[00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:02.240]  You've got China a month ago at the same time as Kim Jong-un saying they're preparing for total war.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.960]  Xi Jinping said that.
[00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.279]  So everything's lined up.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.980]  Everything's going.
[00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:12.240]  And in the escalation with the West taking over all these countries around Russia...
[00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:28.190]  The stage is set for escalation, and that's all we've seen.
[00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:41.490]  And NATO believes Russia, because it did blink over and over and over and over again with the expansion of NATO in the last 30 years, that they would blink.
[00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.970]  But Russia has now said, we're not going to choke.
[00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:47.329]  We're not going to blink.
[00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:50.349]  And they didn't blink going into Ukraine.
[00:17:50.349 --> 00:17:52.710]  They didn't blink bringing in the North Korean troops.
[00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.950]  They didn't blink when it came to moving to the BRICS system.
[00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:12.869]  And if you follow where this is going, it 100% clearly goes to full, absolute, total war.
[00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:26.970]  And if one nuke gets used in all the war game scenarios, it leads to a massive nuclear exchange 100% of the time.
[00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:30.210]  If one nuclear power attacks another nuclear power.
[00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:41.410]  In most of the scenarios, it leads to total destruction of the surface of the earth and total nuclear release.
[00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:52.950]  And 90% of people are dead within a year because of the complete breakdown of civilization and society.
[00:18:53.230 --> 00:19:00.089]  There are almost 500 large nuclear reactors around the world, thousands of other small ones, thousands of secret ones.
[00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:06.490]  All the big reactors in a breakdown of society will start to melt down.
[00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.849]  They are extremely radioactive.
[00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:26.410]  They will put out thousands of times the radiation conservatively that the nuclear war will and will kill everyone in just a matter of years from the meltdown,
[00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.910]  even if you're a mile under a mountain.
[00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.299]  The radiation's gonna get down there.
[00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:36.599]  So, and then there's the numbers, the studies, it's all there.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.400]  I've read them all.
[00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.440]  You're tuning in.
[00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:41.059]  I know new viewers tune in and they go, how does this guy know all this?
[00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.140]  I know it's weird.
[00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:51.440]  See, I don't study sports and I don't know how much, you know, every member of the team bench presses and what their 100-yard dash is and I don't know their names and I don't care.
[00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:59.880]  See, men could know all that because you're designed to know What teams are for business and war and life.
[00:20:00.019 --> 00:20:03.160]  And then they just get you all focused on all this stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:15.759]  So men all know the baseball scores and what this guy pitched and how fast this runner can go and how many field goals this guy kicked and where he went to college and what his mom and dad's names are.
[00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:18.180]  And then his brothers on this other team.
[00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:19.799]  I don't give a damn about that.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.599]  I care about Fission Fusion.
[00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.539]  I care about particle beam accelerators.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.539]  I care about cyclotrons and superconducting supercolliders.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.700]  I care about zero-point energy.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.619]  I care about hydrogen bombs.
[00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.720]  I care about neutron bombs.
[00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:39.539]  I care about fertilizer.
[00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:41.599]  I care about chemicals.
[00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:56.349]  Like Atrazine, I care about physics and chemistry and history and governments and systems of governments and culture and literature and high art and music.
[00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:08.849]  And they don't want people to be like that because they don't want you in the way of their global conquest and their insane satanic plans.
[00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.089]  They want you in a cult where they tell you two men can have a baby and there's no X or Y chromosomes.
[00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:22.730]  And Bill Nye, the science guy, teaches five-year-olds that, that we sit there and we take this cult brainwashing initiation.
[00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.390]  So I'm going to explain this again very calmly and I'm going to come back over all the news I just mentioned showing it all to you.
[00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.690]  Everything I just said, I'll show you.
[00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.970]  I'm going to be very calm when I say this.
[00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:39.809]  On the current trajectory...
[00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.450]  Total thermal nuclear war into the world as we know it.
[00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:56.309]  World War III has begun.
[00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:09.410]  It is conventional now, but in every war game and every analysis and study, it accelerates into hell on earth very quickly.
[00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:13.049]  So, imagine you're in high school and you...
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.059]  Go on a bus trip with your school to the Grand Canyon.
[00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:30.059]  And you're driving around the Grand Canyon and a mile away from the Grand Canyon, the bus driver has a heart attack and dies and falls on the steering wheel and he weighs 300 pounds.
[00:22:30.339 --> 00:22:32.559]  And there's a bunch of 7th graders on the bus.
[00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:40.839]  Now, if you don't get up there and get him off of the wheel and then slam on the brakes...
[00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:48.839]  He's driving in the bus, accelerating down this road, weaving, bashing into cars, but he's still going...
[00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:49.839]  And then...
[00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:52.119]  Now he's not a mile away, he's a half mile away.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.940]  And in about 20-30 seconds, he'll be a quarter mile away.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.660]  And then the bus is going to go over the edge of the Grand Canyon.
[00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.440]  So right now...
[00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:10.440]  Two and a half years ago, when this really kicked off and accelerated and escalated, we were a mile away from the Grand Canyon.
[00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:15.319]  Right now, we are 100 yards from the Grand Canyon going 60 miles an hour.
[00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:23.000]  In a historical matter of seconds, and it could be seconds, could be days, could be weeks, could be months.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.039]  Depends on the time frame.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.000]  But the bus is going over the edge of the Grand Canyon.
[00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.279]  Okay?
[00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.430]  So that's where the bus is pointed.
[00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.930]  That's where we're going.
[00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.289]  In a straight line over the cliff.
[00:23:44.309 --> 00:24:00.170]  Now, the UK and the US and all the other NATO countries have ordered their embassy shut and their staff to get out, expecting a massive Russian counteroffensive.
[00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:06.339]  I don't know if the Russians are stupid enough to do that and use up their weapons on non-military targets.
[00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:18.319]  Because if the government buildings get blown up and Zelensky's unelected palace, he's now a dictator, officially banned all his opposition, took over the media, banned the Orthodox Church, everything else.
[00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:34.880]  If They hit those targets, that will be used to justify the escalation of the war.
[00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:39.180]  So they say discretion is the greater part of valor.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.119]  And that is absolutely true.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.700]  But, would Americans put up with Russia firing missiles in and blowing up military bases?
[00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:54.119]  Would they put up with Trump putting up with that?
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.339]  No.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.450]  And so that's the real problem That Putin has.
[00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:18.369]  So, the United States and the NATO countries, France, Germany, all of them, are now at war with Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.
[00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:26.789]  And they believe that if they can get Trump into a war now, they'll be able to control his administration with this.
[00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:38.410]  And as General Flynn and as Congressman Massey and others said, and Congressman Senator Howley, it will be very hard to put this genie back in the bottle.
[00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.349]  So I hope you kiss your children and say an extra prayer tonight.
[00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:50.730]  And then I hope you call Speaker Johnson's office and put pressure on the Republicans, because a bunch of them are for this as well.
[00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.349]  And I just...
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:19.970]  Hope that and pray that you do pray and that you also educate everybody around you and explain to them that we still shouldn't have on Instagram and Facebook and Google and X the NFL We're good to go.
[00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.289]  We're trying to stop the end of the world here.
[00:26:36.509 --> 00:26:44.950]  So I know Team Humanity is not as cool as your favorite sports team, but if we don't get on Team Humanity, Team Humanity is going to be dead.
[00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:47.450]  I'm going to lay out all the details when we come back.
[00:26:47.569 --> 00:26:48.049]  Stay with us.
[00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:55.230]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.829]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:07.349]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD. It's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it.
[00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:10.509]  And you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:13.750]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.289]  Everybody knows how amazing it is.
[00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:18.170]  But not all CBD is equal.
[00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:31.569]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:42.160]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company, That sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:49.039]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:27:49.259 --> 00:27:52.019]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.509]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor To support their operation and support us.
[00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.309]  And then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:07.089]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.
[00:28:08.349 --> 00:28:09.289]  jonescbd.com.

[00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:16.079]  And Dreamwave.

[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.460]  I know you're going to love it.
[00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.950]  That's what I'm looking for is repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.

[00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.630]  Visit jonescbd.com today, and I think of your support.
[00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:49.289]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Wednesday, November 20th, 2024 transmission.
[00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:58.750]  Notice that we are in the Infowars.com studios, and it is Wednesday, November 20th.
[00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:13.410]  You were told on November 14th, in every major publication in the world, ran it as a top story in many places, that Infowars was closed, Infowars.com was down, and that we've been sold to The Onion.
[00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:19.190]  Now, what did I say Thursday and Friday?
[00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:29.890]  I said, they want me off the air ahead of Trump getting into office because I believe they're getting ready to start bombing Russia.
[00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:30.809]  You can pull a clip up.
[00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:42.289]  Just like I said back on May 31st that they were about to try to kill Trump.
[00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.829]  Now, how do I know that?
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.640]  Well, they know we reach tens of millions of people conservatively a day.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.200]  Now, 60, 70, 80 million conservatively or more.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.460]  They know that I understand the angles.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.000]  They know leaders listen to me, not just the public.
[00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:04.660]  And they know I will put out accurate narratives that challenge them.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:11.500]  So, World War III officially began today.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.839]  You're not going to see that.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.000]  You're not going to read that.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.960]  You're not going to hear that anywhere else.
[00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:21.859]  And I'm not saying that to say, oh, aren't I smart?
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.279]  I'm saying that because understanding that is key.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:43.099]  They want you, they want me, they want all of us to sleepwalk into World War III. I've been saying that For over a decade, and I said Ukraine would be the trigger, not North Korea,
[00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:45.339]  because globalist documents leaked.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.980]  They've been planning a total war with Russia for a long time.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.880]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.480]  That is the reality.
[00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:28.319]  They don't want us to look around ourselves, study military history, study world war doctrine, study modern military doctrine, study nuclear doctrine, study strategic doctrine, study economic doctrine, and not know what's happening.
[00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:29.579]  They want us dumb.
[00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:44.950]  So the number one issue should be stopping this war, And NATO getting directly involved, even though they've been using Ukraine as a proxy and have been directly involved running the whole thing.
[00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:52.609]  And so now Russia has said in their doctrine, if you direct those missiles and attack us, we will be in a state of war.
[00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.910]  They've said that hundreds of times in the last few months.
[00:31:57.049 --> 00:32:10.160]  And now notice, since the attack started two days ago, first by the U.S. and now by the U.K., With another giant barrage of cruise missiles into Russia, bombing Russia, that you don't hear anything from the Russians.
[00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:22.740]  Other than, okay, we just went to our next to final DEFCON. But you sure see the undersea cables getting cut.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.720]  You sure see North Korea blowing up its roads and bridges into South Korea and saying we're about to go to war.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.460]  You sure see Xi Jinping saying prepare for imminent...
[00:32:31.879 --> 00:32:33.539]  Sudden war a month ago.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.799]  That's the last thing you hear is the leaders go, get ready for total war.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.640]  And then when they go to total war, you don't hear it.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.720]  Like Zelensky said over the weekend, he said, I don't want to talk about the missiles.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.319]  I want more missiles.
[00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:50.160]  And when we launch them, they will speak for themselves.
[00:32:53.619 --> 00:33:09.819]  So, we're in World War III. Russia waited to see When the Biden administration bombed them a day and a half ago with attackums, if other NATO nations would join, the German chancellor came out and said,
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.619]  this is bad.
[00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.119]  You shouldn't be doing this.
[00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:19.079]  Germany will not let you have our similar missiles to do this.
[00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:24.000]  So that was the one sane thing we heard from Schultz.
[00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:26.920]  Even though his party doesn't agree with him and they want war.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.819]  And Germany has announced Deutschland operation and are telling their citizens prepare for nuclear war.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.279]  So is Sweden.
[00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.180]  Oh, and don't worry.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.039]  Last year, pull it up, guys.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.440]  New York runs ads online.
[00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:46.640]  Of what to do in a nuclear war.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:54.160]  And they're like, if there's a nuclear war, tune into your local radio station or listen online to find out more.
[00:33:54.339 --> 00:33:56.759]  You won't be listening to radio stations.
[00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:58.680]  Your internet will be off.
[00:33:58.819 --> 00:34:03.000]  And if you're in a big city or near a military target, you'll be dead.
[00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:06.700]  Then the power's off if you live out in the country.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:22.239]  And the survivors, a few days later or weeks later, in giant hordes like locusts, come spilling into your hamlet to eat you.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.320]  Oh yeah, when the food's gone, they eat you in all the simulations.
[00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:34.780]  Within 15 days of the breakdown of society, 10% of people fight to the death or commit suicide.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.780]  90% become cannibals.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.239]  15 days.
[00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:41.519]  Pentagon study.
[00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:50.719]  So, if there's a nuclear war, back in the 60s and 50s and 70s, they ran little news clips.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.519]  They showed newsreels to kids in school.
[00:34:55.579 --> 00:35:02.840]  I'm young enough that when I was in first grade in Rockwall, Texas, they showed us nuclear war preparation drills.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:11.500]  And back then when I'd go into town with my dad on business, we'd park in a parking garage, they had big signs on the wall saying, this is a nuclear fallout shelter.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.739]  Those signs aren't up anymore, because you don't even need to know about that.
[00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:23.559]  But now they run TV ads, we'll play it in a moment, saying, stay tuned!
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.780]  Get inside!
[00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:28.460]  Oh yeah, so the building falls on you.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:40.199]  No, if you know nukes are coming in and you get a warning, which you probably won't, Because it'll be submarine launch from 10 miles off the shore and catch you in about 45 seconds after launch.
[00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:46.880]  You want to get in a storm drain that doesn't have buildings around it.
[00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:49.860]  You want to get into the sewer system.
[00:35:51.039 --> 00:36:02.820]  Hardened concrete below ground so when the buildings fall and crush everybody, you're not in them or you're not on the street when the buildings get blown down the road a mile.
[00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.489]  No, you don't want to be outside.
[00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.590]  You don't want to be in a building.
[00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:17.329]  If you don't have a bomb shelter or storm shelter, you want to be in a sewer system.
[00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:22.309]  You want to lift up a manhole and go down into it.
[00:36:26.949 --> 00:36:29.170]  Then there'll be rubble all over there.
[00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.570]  You'll have to dig yourself out.
[00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.570]  And there'll be dead people everywhere.
[00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.489]  And then the survivors are going to crawl out.
[00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.969]  And then the real fun's going to start.
[00:36:43.789 --> 00:36:54.090]  But they tell people in Los Angeles, in New York, in London, in Berlin, in Paris, they run the same crap everywhere.
[00:36:57.219 --> 00:37:03.500]  Just go in your house, you'll be fine, and tune in to the local TV station.
[00:37:05.099 --> 00:37:06.679]  That's really cute.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:22.119]  It'd be better for them to tell you to just get on the highest hill you can and get closest to the center of town so you die instantly.
[00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:29.920]  That would be more loving and more truthful than, oh, just go in your house and tune in, be told what to do next.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:41.019]  So when the house gets blown a mile down the road, you're all just chopped up, rotting meat in there that's going to be stinking real good in a couple days.
[00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:55.230]  Tell you what, when the hydrogen bombs are dropping, when the cruise missiles are coming in, when the ballistic missiles are coming in, how about you just tell the missiles your pronouns?
[00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:57.630]  Or just tell them you don't identify...
[00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.130]  Say, I don't identify that as a hydrogen bomb.
[00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.389]  And it'll go, okay, there's no such thing as hydrogen bombs.
[00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.369]  It'll just play your little leftist delusional crap.
[00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:13.110]  So the power structure is desperate.
[00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:28.739]  They don't want to lose their globalist power and so they're going to full war with Russia to hold the world hostage and it's totally insane.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:41.829]  And you know if the Russians don't start striking back NATO will just up the provocation Because the decision's been made to start a nuclear war.
[00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:57.449]  I didn't say World War III. We're already in World War III. Russia sat there and waited to see if more countries started piling on with the NATO plan to have each country bomb with their systems that they run,
[00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.650]  their satellites control.
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.489]  Russia, pretending because they're in Ukraine, that isn't a NATO attack.
[00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.110]  And Russia said, no, that's a NATO attack.
[00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:09.610]  We've really already been at war with you, but it'll be official.
[00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:15.650]  So, I know I keep repeating it, but I got a lot of other news here, but this is the big one.
[00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.409]  World War III has started.
[00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:26.710]  The only question is, will it escalate to nuclear war, or will saner people dial this back, and will we have diplomacy and detente?
[00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.050]  Because...
[00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:45.030]  No one right now is talking to the Russians.
[00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:52.610]  And that's the first thing I'm going to cover after I play this clip of Glenn Beck yesterday.
[00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.650]  Talking about this.
[00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:55.690]  You can say, well, that's a clip from yesterday.
[00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.329]  That's old news.
[00:39:56.409 --> 00:39:56.929]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:58.269 --> 00:40:01.070]  The past is the present is the future.
[00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:04.250]  He's explaining in just two short minutes...
[00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:13.829]  Everything, a very complex issue, boiled down in a very accurate way.
[00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.510]  Here it is.
[00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:33.329]  So last night, after, what, a day ago, two days ago, we finally heard that the President had given Ukraine the go-ahead to use these U.S. long-range missiles at Russia.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:41.840]  Ukrainian troops launched an attack against a Russian border region with six U.S. long-range missiles.
[00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:51.360]  This comes after again Putin approved the updated doctrine lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.880]  How many times have this guy given us a red line?
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:04.920]  And said, don't cross this, or it will be World War III. And we've crossed it every single time.
[00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:13.780]  For a man who's backed in the corner, a man who is a bloodthirsty killer, you don't keep backing him into a corner.
[00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:15.380]  Or what happens?
[00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:32.309]  Eventually, he says, I'll have absolutely no credibility, and his people who have just been bombed with U.S. missiles, which he just said two days ago, will be an act of war, has got to say, you know what?
[00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:39.130]  The worst thing I can do is not act, because I'll lose all credibility in my own country and throughout the rest of the world.
[00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.750]  We have entered a moment of madness.
[00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:52.610]  What Joe Biden did is impeachable.
[00:41:53.750 --> 00:42:01.909]  Who launches 62 days before you're out of the office?
[00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:09.949]  Who starts World War III? By the way, there's a couple of other things you should know.
[00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:13.690]  This isn't the only thing going on.
[00:42:15.369 --> 00:42:17.210]  There's been a couple of other things.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.239]  First of all, they cut some telecommunication cables.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:25.920]  Who?
[00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:28.460]  We don't know, but we suspect the Chinese.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:39.360]  The Chinese ship Yi Peng is the main suspect in an investigation now on who cut two undersea telecom cables between Finland and Germany.
[00:42:39.679 --> 00:42:42.960]  Why would you cut cables between Finland and Germany?
[00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:47.559]  Well, if you're going to restore the Soviet Empire...
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.059]  Finland was part of that Soviet empire.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.440]  They've been the ones saying, please stop all this madness.
[00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:57.800]  That was cut.
[00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:03.000]  Oh, also, the telecommunications lines between Sweden and Lithuania.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.699]  Sweden was an allied.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.000]  Lithuania was an Axis.
[00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:12.530]  Lithuania was under Soviet rule as well.
[00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:20.050]  The ship sailed right over the cables when they were cut 8am on Sunday and 2am on Monday.
[00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:28.730]  Gang, things could be different by lunchtime.
[00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:30.210]  Pray for your country.
[00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:38.050]  Pray that Vladimir Putin does not strike a NATO country even with a conventional bomb.
[00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:48.090]  Pray that this madman will listen to Donald Trump and realize this is over in 62 days.
[00:43:50.449 --> 00:43:54.409]  But then again, the guy wants to collapse the United States of America.
[00:43:54.869 --> 00:44:02.210]  As I told you, if Trump wins, one of the things I'm very worried about is terrorism and war.
[00:44:03.969 --> 00:44:11.889]  That the left is so insane that they have this, if I can't have you, no one will.
[00:44:12.329 --> 00:44:20.989]  That they've been backed into a corner, they have everything riding on it, they've got to bring it down before Trump gets in.
[00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.909]  It was the worst case scenario.
[00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:39.949]  Pray the bloodthirsty madman in Russia, Is more sensible than this senile bastard in the White House.
[00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:43.469]  Now, that was yesterday.
[00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.969]  World War III was not here, but it was one second away.
[00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:58.909]  Now, the UK has joined in, and reportedly, I guess, more missiles have been fired, more missiles are blowing up inside Russia.
[00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.489]  Was 12, 20, maybe it'll be 100.
[00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:08.829]  And NATO has thousands of missiles of these types.
[00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:16.969]  And so what does Russia do a day after they get hit by the U.S.? The U.S. runs all their missiles.
[00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.869]  That's admitted.
[00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:19.090]  Satellite controlled.
[00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.730]  And then now the U.K. starts bombing.
[00:45:24.989 --> 00:45:27.789]  They came over here months ago and asked Biden to do it first.
[00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.090]  The U.S. did it first.
[00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.969]  You go first.
[00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:30.869]  Okay.
[00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.269]  You're the leader.
[00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:33.210]  You go first.
[00:45:33.949 --> 00:45:34.929]  Okay, we'll go first.
[00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.130]  Show me yours, I'll show you mine.
[00:45:40.969 --> 00:45:42.869]  Show me your World War III, I'll show you mine.
[00:45:43.969 --> 00:45:45.010]  Come on, come on, let's do it.
[00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:45.329]  Let's go.
[00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:46.030]  You first.
[00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.269]  And now, what is Russia going to do?
[00:45:49.489 --> 00:45:50.289]  What have they done?
[00:45:50.429 --> 00:45:52.409]  Well, they got together in the last few hours.
[00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:54.469]  You know, that's their doctrine.
[00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.369]  They already said what they would do.
[00:45:56.389 --> 00:45:59.750]  And they said, okay, we're now officially at war with the United States of America.
[00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.750]  And all the other little NATO clowns.
[00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:08.030]  And you know they're talking to Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un and the Ayatollah.
[00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:11.769]  And they're, okay, what do we do next?
[00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:20.429]  And that's being discussed right now at 11.51 Central Standard Time here in the United States.
[00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:23.170]  Let's look up what it is Moscow time.
[00:46:23.269 --> 00:46:25.190]  Let's look up what Beijing time is right now.
[00:46:25.409 --> 00:46:27.389]  Let's look up what Pyongyang is.
[00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:30.969]  Let's look up what time it is in Tehran.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.039]  And that's where we are.
[00:46:35.239 --> 00:46:43.739]  That's where the crazy people that thought they could dissolve the border and smuggle at least 325,000 kids and put them in slave labor and sex slavery and disappear their identities.
[00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:46.860]  I mean, these are crazy people.
[00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:52.980]  Just like the crazy U.S. trustee on May 31st came in here without a warrant and said, close the building.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.780]  And I said, no, I'll go to court.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.900]  And the judge said, no.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.159]  It's 8.51 p.m.
[00:46:58.239 --> 00:46:58.579]  in Moscow.
[00:47:01.619 --> 00:47:03.659]  And people go, what's that to do with that?
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:17.739]  It's emblematic of the crazy people in the U.S. government and their similar counterparts that all the military advisors said, don't do this, don't escalate over the last few years, because it leads to this.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:28.679]  And now we're here, and now the next steps are already happening, and we are sleepwalking into the end of the world as we know it.
[00:47:29.539 --> 00:47:30.780]  And I don't feel fine.
[00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:38.489]  And I'm sitting here with family saying, how big a turkey should we get?
[00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.750]  And should we get a ham?
[00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.050]  And I'm sitting here thinking, will this be the last Thanksgiving I ever have?
[00:47:46.889 --> 00:47:53.489]  And Putin said this will potentially be the last Christmas ever on the current escalation path.
[00:47:53.489 --> 00:47:56.650]  This is the Russian statement yesterday for the foreign ministry from Putin.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.960]  We will have nuclear war by Christmas.
[00:48:03.219 --> 00:48:07.300]  So we're not just looking at a countdown 60 days till Trump's in office.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.219]  We'll put that on screen.
[00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:12.679]  Now we're looking to a countdown to nuclear war.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.940]  So how many days till Christmas?
[00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:18.440]  Let me see.
[00:48:18.699 --> 00:48:21.320]  December 25th.
[00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:26.460]  So you add 11 days to 25.
[00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:30.090]  36 days.
[00:48:31.289 --> 00:48:37.389]  According to the guy with the biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world and submarines off our coast.
[00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:48.530]  Loaded with ballistic nuclear missiles and cruise missiles that are hypersonic.
[00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.349]  Something's hypersonic if it goes faster than...
[00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:58.250]  Last time I checked, whoa, whoa.
[00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:02.139]  Hypersonics faster than Mach 5, isn't it?
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.360]  Guys, pull up the definition of hypersonic for me.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.659]  I want to make sure my memory's not failing.
[00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:11.059]  They got hypersonic missiles that go Mach 15.
[00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:13.300]  Oh, but don't worry, we do too.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:13.960]  Great!
[00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:16.219]  That's wonderful.
[00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:24.139]  You know, they'll shoot us with a 12-gauge shotgun and My memory is right.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.539]  More than five times the speed of sound.
[00:49:27.039 --> 00:49:28.199]  See, I just do that.
[00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:29.639]  That wasn't planned with the crew.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.860]  I didn't even look up hypersonic.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.539]  I was from memory.
[00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:32.900]  But I like them to test me.
[00:49:33.059 --> 00:49:35.179]  You know, and I'm right about 99% of the time on memory.
[00:49:36.019 --> 00:49:45.059]  So, missiles that go, their average missile goes ten times the speed of sound.
[00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:54.989]  They've got some that go 18, 19 times, but they've got deployed hypersonics that go 15 times the speed of sound.
[00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.230]  You know how fast one of those missiles comes?
[00:49:57.329 --> 00:49:58.690]  You know you can't shoot those down.
[00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.329]  They admit, you can't shoot them down.
[00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:03.590]  You can't stop them.
[00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.389]  Except with an X-ray laser.
[00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:21.070]  And you know what x-ray lasers will do if they detonate those in the atmosphere?
[00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.909]  Oh, they'll take out a lot of the nukes.
[00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:32.610]  They'll also knock out any telecommunications anywhere in the field.
[00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.090]  And the fields expand as they go out.
[00:50:37.389 --> 00:50:47.840]  So yeah, you knock out missiles coming down over the United States, and then those x-ray detonations, hydrogen bombs in space, That are projected through laser arrays.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.880]  Fry everything on the ground.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:55.900]  And if you get hit by it, even when it's dissipated, well, you'll die maybe in a few weeks.
[00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:57.679]  Very nutritious.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.940]  It's a focused neutron bomb array.
[00:51:04.119 --> 00:51:09.639]  It's a hydrogen bomb detonation powered laser system.
[00:51:10.639 --> 00:51:11.260]  Yeah.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.699]  And there's a bunch of them up there.
[00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:42.300]  So, the West thinks they can decapitate the Chinese and decapitate the Russians, but the Russians on record have a doomsday switch since the 60s and so do the Chinese that will release any of their nuclear forces that are left.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:52.820]  And that's why they've got 20 times more than they need, or more, is let's say 1 20th of the missiles hit us, we're all dead.
[00:51:53.699 --> 00:51:55.460]  That's why there's the overkill.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.599]  Like, why do we need 30,000 nuclear weapons?
[00:51:59.719 --> 00:52:01.000]  Why do the Russians have 50?
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.300]  Why do the Chinese have 30,000?
[00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:05.420]  That's why.
[00:52:07.859 --> 00:52:09.800]  So, it's called mutually assured destruction.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.619]  You've got to have a giant arsenal so no one ever tries it.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.440]  Who would be crazy enough to do that?
[00:52:15.539 --> 00:52:16.599]  I didn't even plug this hour.
[00:52:16.719 --> 00:52:17.840]  If you don't, supporters will be shut down.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.039]  The AlexJonesStore.com is not owned by InfoWars.
[00:52:21.159 --> 00:52:22.380]  The bad guys can't shut it down.
[00:52:23.099 --> 00:52:24.519]  Great t-shirts, great supplements.
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.960]  We're trying to stop World War III. I need your support.
[00:52:27.159 --> 00:52:28.659]  Go to the AlexJonesStore.com right now.
[00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:29.199]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.719]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.860]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy and has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[00:52:38.119 --> 00:52:39.679]  The latest case was last week.
[00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:41.519]  The judge shut them down.
[00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:42.579]  They were thrown out of the building.
[00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:43.920]  Crimes were committed.
[00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:45.800]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.639]  I've filed counter lawsuits.
[00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:48.880]  You name it.
[00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:51.210]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[00:52:51.329 --> 00:52:52.989]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[00:52:53.750 --> 00:53:07.269]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.250]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:13.929]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[00:53:14.449 --> 00:53:20.190]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[00:53:20.369 --> 00:53:21.250]  I don't even own that.
[00:53:21.369 --> 00:53:22.050]  It's the sponsor.
[00:53:22.409 --> 00:53:35.460]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:39.719]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[00:53:40.099 --> 00:53:44.780]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.679]  The Onion does not own me.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.940]  They do not own the Alex Jones Store.
[00:53:50.690 --> 00:54:08.289]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.389 --> 00:54:13.170]  I can beat them, but not without your help.
[00:54:13.429 --> 00:54:16.090]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:16.690]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:18.449]  It's not owned by me.
[00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.329]  It's not owned by The Onion.
[00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.150]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:30.150]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:32.369]  It's thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:34.570]  It's the future one way or another.

[00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:47.489]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:48.429]  We're fighting hard.
[00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:49.449]  We're winning.
[00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:51.269]  But the fight is close.
[00:54:51.429 --> 00:54:56.690]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:55:16.409 --> 00:55:17.750]  Alright, here's what's going on.
[00:55:20.769 --> 00:55:24.329]  A lot of radio stations, as you know, don't carry the first five minutes of this.
[00:55:24.469 --> 00:55:25.150]  We're not just on the internet.
[00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:26.309]  That's how they took me off.
[00:55:27.289 --> 00:55:33.469]  Basically everything other than Infowars.com, the deplatforming six years ago, we were able to stay on air and then build back up.
[00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:35.550]  We love our radio stations.
[00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:36.309]  They're very precious.
[00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:45.690]  And I just did a whole hour and didn't talk about the bad guys trying to shut us down and just how flagrant it is.
[00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.650]  And later in the broadcast, I'll do some updates on that.
[00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:52.449]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:53.929]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:56.030]  What they did was illegal on its face.
[00:55:56.409 --> 00:55:57.750]  We've said that in our lawsuits.
[00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.829]  The U.S. Code, all of it.
[00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.550]  Obviously, it's being referred to the Justice Department for prosecution.
[00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.949]  It's their own people doing it, the Justice Department.
[00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:13.690]  So if we can stop World War III and get Trump in there, I would imagine there'll be some indictments.
[00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.489]  But regardless...
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.760]  We're winning in court on every front.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.619]  They're in deep trouble.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.179]  And we just need funds to do this.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:30.980]  So, it has been devastating to InfoWars when they hijacked the building and said they owned it fraudulently and had to leave because it was literally a criminal hijacking.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.159]  Because people think they own the InfoWars store.
[00:56:39.719 --> 00:56:47.760]  The products there, the warehouses in Denver, Even when they hijacked it, they said, no, we're going to keep the store open.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.159]  They were going to try to make money off that.
[00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:52.320]  So if you order stuff there, you'll get it.
[00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:56.380]  That said, I don't expect you to go there.
[00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:04.980]  The AlexJonesStore.com is where you go.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:11.760]  It's a sponsor of InfoWars and funds it if it survives, which I believe it will.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.480]  I mean, it's basically impossible that the judge doesn't do the right thing.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:30.360]  From what I've been told by legal scholars, not just my lawyers, but some very prominent ones as well, they said they read the case and saw the filing and saw the documents that we filed and saw the documents that the other real bidder filed, and it's open and shut.
[00:57:30.619 --> 00:57:36.400]  I mean, just classic, if you were, you know, doing your law thesis, you know, on...
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.119]  As a lawyer, you know, to become a bankruptcy lawyer.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:48.539]  And they said, write a thesis on the most ridiculous, transparent, over-the-top fraud.
[00:57:48.539 --> 00:57:52.960]  Make it the most outrageous, spectacular thing you could do.
[00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:53.619]  This is it.
[00:57:54.719 --> 00:58:00.679]  Buy bankruptcy trustees colluding with debtors.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:02.900]  So...
[00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:06.679]  And a bunch of lawyers have now looked at the case.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.679]  There's videos everywhere.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.960]  They're like, oh my god, this is crap.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.119]  I mean, even mainstream media is like, whoa, this looks really bad.
[00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:12.000]  I've got the articles.
[00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:15.159]  It's just that we're dealing with World War III situations here, so...
[00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:22.989]  It's very hard for me to focus on this, but massive damages as well, and it's cut and dry.
[00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:23.969]  It's not like a long lawsuit.
[00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.369]  They illegally grabbed the building.
[00:58:25.489 --> 00:58:28.929]  They said they owned it, and it was 70% last night.
[00:58:28.929 --> 00:58:29.610]  I just checked.
[00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.469]  It's over 80% down at infowarstore.com.
[00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:38.409]  If that continues, we will close because of the fraud, the lie, the destroying of the brand, saying they own it.
[00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:39.510]  People don't want to give them money.
[00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:40.289]  I don't blame them.
[00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:42.230]  So that's where we are.
[00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:43.989]  I'm going to say this, though.
[00:58:44.909 --> 00:58:49.130]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is not owned by me, so they can't get it.
[00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:50.929]  It's not owned by Infowars.
[00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:59.150]  It's owned by one of the top makers of Patriot Apparel for many years that are huge sponsors of most of the big Patriot shows.
[00:58:59.489 --> 00:59:00.750]  They're badass Patriots.
[00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:01.530]  You've seen them on the show.
[00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:03.469]  They're going to be here Friday with the winner of the last truck.
[00:59:04.539 --> 00:59:08.199]  The very best designs, the very best shirts, the very best supplements, they're all amazing.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.780]  It'll enrich your life so much like the ultimate CMOS is just incredible.
[00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:12.840]  The superfood.
[00:59:13.559 --> 00:59:19.699]  We need money right now because we had enough to win these suits and keep operating with the Alex Jones Network even if it shuts down.
[00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:22.760]  This has been crippling.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.099]  So folks, They don't own the All Show Store.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:26.760]  Go there now.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.380]  We need your support.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.039]  Please take action.
[00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:35.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have big breaking developments on World War III. World War III has begun.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.019]  I just explained that last hour.
[00:59:38.159 --> 00:59:41.260]  The only question is, will it go into full thermal nuclear war?
[00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.619]  Will the escalation continue?
[00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:52.730]  Breaking Russian, Dmitry Medvedev, one of the top ministers, issued a statement after Ukraine fires U.S. and U.K.-supplied missiles into Russia.
[00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:59.469]  Russia's new nuclear doctrine means NATO missiles fired against our country could be deemed an attack on the block of Russia.
[00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:04.429]  Russia could retaliate with WMD against Kiev and key NATO facilities.
[01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:09.429]  Wherever they're located, this means World War III. That's the statement.
[01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:13.690]  Putin lowers nuclear threshold in warning to the West.
[01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:20.230]  The threat comes as Ukraine begins using U.S. supply to tacums and now British storm shadows, similar class.
[01:00:20.769 --> 01:00:23.969]  And then to the point I was getting ready to make with even more that just broke.
[01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:27.110]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:38.329]  Biden, Defense Secretary Austin, totally incompetent, never even at work, gone for months, lied to everybody, in control of the nuclear arsenal, needs to be court-martialed even though he's a civilian.
[01:00:39.329 --> 01:00:40.170]  But he's still a general.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.489]  Austin dismisses Russia's warning.
[01:00:42.969 --> 01:00:45.789]  Says Putin bluffing about nuclear response.
[01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:52.090]  Just like he was bluffing that if NATO kept expanding into Ukraine he would invade.
[01:00:52.329 --> 01:00:52.869]  Right Austin?
[01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.650]  So the whole future of the world rests on people like this.
[01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:04.099]  We'll be playing that video here in a moment.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.079]  Now here's the big enchilada.
[01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:12.860]  Kremlin says Russia-US hotline to deflate crisis not in use.
[01:01:13.639 --> 01:01:15.219]  That is yesterday.
[01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:21.460]  I've been harping on this for the last two and a half years, plus the Russians say they've talked to no one.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.000]  So when January 6th happened, And Trump said, go to the Capitol peacefully.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.280]  Provocateurs set us up.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:35.380]  And he was supposed to come speak at a platform right there on the edge of the Capitol, on the northwest corner.
[01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:41.519]  They lied and said he said attack the Capitol, cut off his internet, kicked him off X, Facebook everywhere.
[01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:45.199]  The media wouldn't interview him so they could lie and say he said attack the Capitol.
[01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:50.699]  And Milley admits he called up the Chinese top generals and said, I've got the nukes.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.900]  Don't worry, we've removed Trump.
[01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:52.860]  We're not going to nuke you.
[01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:55.869]  Why the hell would Trump nuke China?
[01:01:58.030 --> 01:01:59.610]  Trump doesn't want nuclear war.
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:03.050]  He likes his family and his golf courses and society and civilization.
[01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:19.190]  So they're talking to the Chinese about Trump, but they won't talk to the Russians, who are allied with the Chinese in a defense pact, meaning if Russia goes to full war, which they said if we hit them with missiles, they would.
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:23.489]  And you can bet they haven't made the announcement yet, but this is an act of war.
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:30.030]  Kremlin says Russia-US hotline to deflate crisis not in use.
[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:33.170]  Reuters.
[01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:38.510]  US-Russia crisis hotline no longer in use, says Kremlin.
[01:02:41.429 --> 01:02:46.389]  Meanwhile, Danish Navy hunts down Chinese ships suspected of sabotaging Baltic sea cables.
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:47.309]  See?
[01:02:47.449 --> 01:02:48.070]  It's going hot.
[01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.269]  So this is huge.
[01:02:53.409 --> 01:02:56.670]  Hotline between Russia and U.S. not in use currently.
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.889]  Kremlin spokesperson.
[01:02:57.889 --> 01:02:59.610]  They said, we'd like to talk to you.
[01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.289]  That's today.
[01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:03.230]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:06.150]  Russia-U.S. hotline to deflate crisis.
[01:03:06.329 --> 01:03:06.750]  Not in use.
[01:03:06.889 --> 01:03:07.110]  Kremlin.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.690]  Ukraine fires British storm-shadow missiles into Russia today.
[01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.170]  Russia-Ukraine war latest.
[01:03:17.389 --> 01:03:19.829]  Ukraine fires storm-shadow missiles into Russia.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.639]  Massive, massive, massive.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.400]  And look at this.
[01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:41.119]  Germany's W3 plan, Operation Deutschland, with 800,000 troops and 20,000 trucks, ready since the first time since the end of World War II to go directly to war with Russia.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.739]  25, 26 million Russians killed, 24 million Germans killed.
[01:03:47.639 --> 01:03:54.559]  Almost all of the people killed in World War II that were military or civilians were killed, with those two countries killing each other.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.940]  Yeah, we think of our participation as big, and it was big for us.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:11.719]  Memory serves, what did we lose in World War II? I think it's 600,000 U.S.? I forget, look it up.
[01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:18.010]  Compare that to 24 million dead Germans, 25, 26.
[01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:20.269]  Sometimes there's 28 million dead Russians.
[01:04:20.869 --> 01:04:23.449]  That was close to a third of the Russian population back then.
[01:04:24.449 --> 01:04:25.750]  Kind of a pretty big deal, right?
[01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.610]  Think that's a big deal to them?
[01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:29.170]  Think they remember that?
[01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:32.389]  Their big World War II victory day that's bigger than Christmas over there?
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.590]  So...
[01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:39.889]  Think they remember being invaded by the Muslims and the Huns thousands of times?
[01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.090]  Think they remember Napoleon invading?
[01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:45.269]  I mean, this is not their first rodeo.
[01:04:46.429 --> 01:05:06.349]  So, they've got a giant nuclear arsenal, the biggest in the world, totally deployed, ready, and I mean, I'm just sitting here on air on Wednesday, November 20th, 2024, and I am just...
[01:05:09.699 --> 01:05:10.579]  Absolutely dumbfounded.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.800]  I mean, and then you've got Austin.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.820]  Oh, it's just all a bluff.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.420]  Yeah, the million dead troops.
[01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:18.659]  That's a high number.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.280]  600,000 is the conservative number.
[01:05:21.059 --> 01:05:22.480]  Yeah, this is a bluff.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:29.260]  So, you talk about playing Russian roulette with nuclear weapons and the end of the world, this is it.
[01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:33.550]  I mean, if there was one out of six chance, that's Russian roulette.
[01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:39.829]  .357, revolver, six chambers, six bullets.
[01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.250]  You spin it, you put it to your head, you pull the trigger.
[01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:49.690]  If this was a normal Russian roulette, one out of six chance you're going to blow your head off, would you play it?
[01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.230]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.929]  It's three out of six chambers in my view.
[01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.389]  It's a 50-50 chance total nuclear war at this point.
[01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.869]  If the trajectory continues, it's a certainty.
[01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.750]  So, Lloyd Austin for months...
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:19.639]  Had a giant infection in his colon and reportedly ate part of his guts.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.239]  They admit that.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.519]  So he had rotting guts with pus coming out of his ass.
[01:06:25.679 --> 01:06:26.659]  I'm not trying to be gross here.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.619]  I want you to think about this.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.860]  And under law, if he's going to go under surgery for an hour, he's got to notify the President and Congress.
[01:06:34.159 --> 01:06:46.059]  And for months, over a month and a half, he had his staff lie, and lie when he went back to the hospital in an ambulance, repeatedly, that he was incapacitated and get ready for this.
[01:06:46.219 --> 01:06:56.199]  He put no one under him in charge when he's in charge with the Pentagon under the President's orders of the nuclear weapons.
[01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:06.659]  Incompetent, stupid, evil, globalists, just like Milley.
[01:07:07.139 --> 01:07:09.300]  Milley's probably even worse if it's possible.
[01:07:10.539 --> 01:07:34.619]  And so this globalist, this dereliction of duty, extreme negligence, jerk, That gave poison shots to our military and DEI training and transgender crap to demoralize and purge the military.
[01:07:35.139 --> 01:07:38.760]  He says Russia's bluffing.
[01:07:45.699 --> 01:07:48.920]  And the Ukrainians have been totally slaughtered and collapsed.
[01:07:50.110 --> 01:08:07.889]  And so now NATO is officially coming to the war and when you've got giant multinational powers with Russia allied with China, North Korea, Iran against the United States and NATO,
[01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:19.859]  that's a global war when it kicks off And the mutual defense treaties kick in, which have kicked in.
[01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:23.100]  That's why the North Korean troops are there in Russia and Ukraine.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.939]  And World War III really started a month ago.
[01:08:28.619 --> 01:08:39.180]  But now it's going to be announced that a state of war between Russia and its allies and NATO exists now.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.500]  And nobody will tell you that.
[01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:45.119]  But I will.
[01:08:46.930 --> 01:09:00.109]  And by admitting that, we can have cooler heads prevail and put pressure on Congress and these out-of-control agencies that are running things, certainly not Kamala Harris in Hawaii and idiot Biden down in Brazil.
[01:09:01.489 --> 01:09:12.670]  The bureaucracy sat around mahogany tables at the State Department and the CIA and And they talked to their big globalist owners at BlackRock and the central banks.
[01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:14.689]  And they said, our whole system's coming to an end.
[01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:15.989]  We've got to bully everybody into submission.
[01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:17.390]  Domestically, everybody's waking up.
[01:09:17.489 --> 01:09:18.069]  Trump's coming in.
[01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:19.590]  We're about to have an era of peace and prosperity.
[01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:21.510]  What are we going to do?
[01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:31.869]  Let's start World War III. Yeah, when you've got North Korean troops...
[01:09:32.170 --> 01:10:00.130]  In Russia, massing and going into Ukraine, and the West is bombing Russia with high-powered precision missiles, that's World War III. Guys, get the Biden clip when he said, if we send F-16s and Abrams tanks, that's World War III. Because he was being told by his advisors on the Rand Corporation threat escalation ladder that that will then lead to full war and nuclear war on that trajectory.
[01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:05.970]  Just like when Alec Baldwin pointed that loaded gun and pulled the trigger at that woman and killed her.
[01:10:07.909 --> 01:10:10.649]  When he pointed the loaded gun, probably didn't know.
[01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:15.609]  Some probably passive-aggressive person that was mad at him or something, obviously got set up.
[01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:18.699]  Still doesn't matter.
[01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:20.159]  The point is, it's manslaughter.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.439]  He pointed that gun at her.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.840]  That's the trajectory.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:34.340]  And once you pull the trigger, and the trigger's being pulled right now, that's World War III. That's World War III. He said it a few times.
[01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:45.399]  He goes, we can send you tanks and all that, but that's World War III. I can't remember which version, just by seeing it they got.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.220]  There's one where he says...
[01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:53.430]  Abrams tanks and F-16s, that's World War III. And another one he just says, we can't send Abrams tanks, that's World War III. Let's see which one they found.
[01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.810]  Here it is.
[01:10:54.619 --> 01:10:56.300]  The war against Ukraine will never be a victory.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:02.020]  Democrats are rising to meet the moment, rallying the world on the side of peace and security.
[01:11:02.579 --> 01:11:05.199]  We're showing the strength and we'll never falter.
[01:11:05.399 --> 01:11:20.579]  But look, the idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand, and don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say,
[01:11:21.159 --> 01:11:25.279]  that's called World War III. Okay?
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.680]  Let's get...
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.279]  Let's get that straight.
[01:11:29.479 --> 01:11:32.140]  So let's pull up my X account to the live show feeds.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.579]  Let's see if they've put a community notes on...
[01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:49.710]  Because a couple times this has happened where I say, NATO is officially backing war with Russia and is officially directing the war, and they hadn't admitted that yet.
[01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.630]  So they said, NATO says that's not official.
[01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:53.689]  I said it was.
[01:11:53.789 --> 01:11:55.149]  And a month later, they admitted it.
[01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:02.310]  So, see, we don't just have to wait for the establishment to tell us something.
[01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.529]  We can make our own decisions.
[01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.310]  Like, no, there are X and Y chromosomes.
[01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:07.710]  Let's see if there's community notes yet.
[01:12:14.699 --> 01:12:16.539]  Nope, no community notes yet.
[01:12:16.859 --> 01:12:18.159]  Okay, well, maybe.
[01:12:19.779 --> 01:12:21.500]  I'm just waiting for it.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.699]  Because last time NATO responded.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:38.079]  So, will NATO go in there on X today and say, no, this isn't World War III? That'd be nice to hear from NATO. No, no, NATO says they're ready for a 30-year war with Russia.
[01:12:38.079 --> 01:12:51.619]  It's the new official policy of the EU. The French government, the Swiss, not the Swiss, the French government, the Swedish government, others have said our new economy is war for 20 to 30 years, and we need to get ready for a national draft, including women.
[01:12:52.550 --> 01:13:04.569]  And Germany's mobilized for total war, and it's told their citizens, prepare for nuclear war, and they're still airing TV ads in New York saying, if you hear a nuclear war starts, go in your house and listen to the radio.
[01:13:06.569 --> 01:13:23.090]  We'll play that clip in a moment, but first, here's Lloyd Austin, the absent, out-to-lunch, Secretary of Defense, Just saying, Russia is bluffing.
[01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:23.649]  Here it is.
[01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:31.069]  We've known for several weeks that they were revamping their policy on the use of nuclear weapons.
[01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:41.890]  As I look at what they're doing, and we watch their strategic forces very carefully, I don't see a change in their strategic force posture.
[01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:46.029]  And so we'll continue to remain vigilant in this regard.
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:56.579]  But at this point, no, I don't see an indication that there's an imminent Intent to use nuclear weapons.
[01:13:58.479 --> 01:14:00.800]  Okay, so hopefully they don't use nuclear weapons.
[01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:02.260]  Imminent intent.
[01:14:02.579 --> 01:14:03.020]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.239]  So imminent means like right now?
[01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:06.340]  What about next month, next week?
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.859]  What about Putin's statement about nuclear war by Christmas on the current escalation route?
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.039]  Notice he uses all the terms I use.
[01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:17.420]  Because you see, the Russians all do the same war games.
[01:14:18.529 --> 01:14:20.109]  And they come up with the same doctrine.
[01:14:20.409 --> 01:14:21.430]  I've got the Russian doctrine.
[01:14:21.569 --> 01:14:22.649]  I've got the U.S. doctrine right here.
[01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:26.170]  Let me show you the original 1960s doctrine that they still follow today.
[01:14:26.649 --> 01:14:30.630]  This is the Herman Kahn threat escalation ladder.
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:38.390]  And we're way up here in conventional military escalation between major powers and the next limited nuclear war starts.
[01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:42.529]  That's the escalation ladder.
[01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:48.050]  A generalized abstract scenario.
[01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:52.750]  This is just one of thousands of permutations of these that we know of.
[01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:53.770]  Probably more.
[01:14:54.329 --> 01:14:57.569]  So, here is the official U.S. policy.
[01:14:57.949 --> 01:15:00.930]  Read this on the Pentagon's website or State Department.
[01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:06.010]  Yes, the United States has a nuclear first strike policy.
[01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:09.270]  It has the Orwellian term, no first use.
[01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:19.439]  The U.S. has not adopted a no first use policy, so they have a And reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first in the event of a conflict.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.000]  So the policy is called no first use policy, which means they reserve the right to use weapons.
[01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:27.720]  Don't you love that?
[01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:33.699]  We reserve the right to nuke you first in a sneak attack, so we call it the no first use policy.
[01:15:35.659 --> 01:15:42.159]  Like when they pull troops out of a country, they call it a build down.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.060]  And of course, as I mentioned, I've got lots of other news here, but I think we should probably revisit this a little bit.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.340]  The White House goes, I mean, Biden got asked last year, they said, hey, the Russians say you don't ever talk to him.
[01:15:57.439 --> 01:16:00.739]  He goes, yeah, I haven't talked to Putin since a couple weeks before he invented Ukraine.
[01:16:00.859 --> 01:16:01.479]  I'm not going to talk to him.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.539]  What the hell would I want to talk to him for?
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:03.819]  You want to see the clip?
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.119]  What the hell would I want to talk to him for, man?
[01:16:11.399 --> 01:16:16.220]  And then when Trump would actually talk to him, oh my God, the president talked to a foreign leader with the biggest nuclear weapons arsenal.
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.680]  You're not supposed to do that!
[01:16:24.319 --> 01:16:29.880]  And that's why they don't want the presidents talking to him, because they're actually in charge of the real president, and they don't want that.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.340]  All right.
[01:16:32.399 --> 01:16:33.260]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:16:34.479 --> 01:16:35.760]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:16:37.899 --> 01:16:39.020]  Larry Payton is coming on.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:39.699]  Love him to death.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.000]  Original founding member of the Real Black Panther Party.
[01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:43.079]  He's always got a lot to say.
[01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.720]  And then Naomi Wolf is going to come on and we'll continue on to the fourth hour.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:55.140]  But I'm going to give the number out right now and I'm going to take just eight calls on specifics of World War III has begun.
[01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.140]  You can say you agree or disagree as a caller.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.380]  I know it has.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.100]  According to all the policy, it's here.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.659]  Will it get nuclear?
[01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:04.520]  How do we stop it?
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.180]  What should we do?
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.180]  Where's the Republican leadership?
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:08.760]  Where's Trump?
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.859]  You know that video I played, everybody goes, oh, Trump's against the war.
[01:17:13.039 --> 01:17:15.159]  We explained that's from a year ago.
[01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.220]  And it's very pertinent now, but we need new statements.
[01:17:20.439 --> 01:17:25.859]  I mean, the two days of silence on this by Trump, you guys, check his true social.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.359]  Maybe since I checked an hour ago, it's happened.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.899]  Where's Trump's statement?
[01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.909]  Great, he's down in Texas watching the great rocket launch.
[01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:35.329]  Amazing.
[01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:36.970]  That's the kind of missiles we should be launching.
[01:17:38.489 --> 01:17:40.630]  Not the attackums and storm shadows.
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.109]  Beautiful.
[01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.210]  Aspirations for humans into space in the future.
[01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:47.649]  But what do you think we should do?
[01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:49.750]  We'll talk about stopping this when we come back.
[01:17:50.329 --> 01:17:52.449]  877-789-2539.
[01:17:52.649 --> 01:17:55.369]  877-789-2539.
[01:17:56.939 --> 01:18:00.199]  But the Justice Department illegally seized the building last week.
[01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:03.260]  They then ran out of here, realizing it was a crime they committed.
[01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:04.300]  Open on its face.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.300]  They tried to steal my identity to get it shut down.
[01:18:08.479 --> 01:18:11.939]  And I want to explain to you, we're going to play a little announcement here.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:13.939]  The three minute one.
[01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:17.380]  No, the Onion does not own InfoWars.
[01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:25.270]  But that's emblematic of the tyranny, emblematic of the desperateness of these people.
[01:18:25.369 --> 01:18:26.170]  Here we are in the studios.
[01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:27.470]  That was another lie you heard.
[01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:30.550]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.630]  877-789-2539.
[01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:36.869]  877-789-2539.
[01:18:37.829 --> 01:18:39.170]  Regardless, we need to stay on the air.
[01:18:39.369 --> 01:18:40.310]  Only you can do that.
[01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:42.909]  Please support us now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.260]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[01:18:45.539 --> 01:18:50.420]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.239]  The latest case was last week.
[01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:55.539]  The judge shut them down, they were thrown out of the building, crimes were committed.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.420]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[01:18:57.619 --> 01:19:00.119]  I filed counter lawsuits, you name it.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:11.460]  If what Alex Jones describes is correct, Steve, that there were other bidders, you know, maybe led by Roger Stone, and he's a hero for putting them together, to try to rescue Infowars.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:18.279]  And if they had the highest bid and that was ignored, you know, that's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.960]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.739]  If you order there, you'll get your products.

[01:19:39.739 --> 01:19:42.319]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:48.020]  The Onion didn't get Infowars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[01:19:48.199 --> 01:19:49.079]  I don't even own that.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:49.899]  It's the sponsor.

[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.939]  The Onion does not own me.

[01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:15.710]  We're winning.

[01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:51.050]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:56.890]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud levels over foreseen.
[01:21:57.609 --> 01:22:12.600]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party allied with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.279]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:18.560]  But we can't control everything individually.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.380]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.220]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.220]  And I've got faith.
[01:22:23.399 --> 01:22:42.229]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug resistance and The antibiotic-resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.

[01:25:47.239 --> 01:25:56.939]  sending a giant spacecraft, compared to anyone ever deployed, into orbit.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.340]  That's the type of missiles we need to be firing as humanity reaches out into God's heavens.
[01:26:09.319 --> 01:26:13.960]  Innovation, science, technology, liberty, freedom, justice, security.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:26.109]  Instead, the globalist Have gotten us into full war with Russia.
[01:26:26.329 --> 01:26:35.789]  It is World War III. By Russia's standards, by Russia's announcements, if the missiles are deployed and greenlit, we're officially at war with NATO. Much less bombing them.
[01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:44.189]  Russia sat back for two days, waited to see what Congress did, waited for repudiation from the Republicans, waited to see what Trump would say.
[01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:47.810]  Trump made a statement a year ago.
[01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:48.569]  In fact, get that ready.
[01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:55.710]  We put it out, pointed out it was a year old, but he was dead on that it was leading to World War III. People thought it was new.
[01:26:56.250 --> 01:27:01.170]  We posted it three times on X with my comments on it.
[01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:04.489]  All three videos got over 40 million views apiece.
[01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.569]  And by that, that's a lot of people we reached.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:12.470]  Around 120 million views.
[01:27:12.789 --> 01:27:13.930]  And other people had it.
[01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:15.909]  People were interested to hear what Trump said.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.020]  He's down in Texas watching SpaceX.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:19.500]  Great.
[01:27:20.439 --> 01:27:29.800]  I've seen more talk about the Cybertruck and his motorcade than I've heard about this global crisis.
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.479]  So again, Trump looks great.
[01:27:34.399 --> 01:27:35.399]  Elon's amazing.
[01:27:35.659 --> 01:27:36.300]  This is fantastic.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.020]  I love it.
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:37.739]  That's what I want to see.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.720]  This is the good stuff.
[01:27:41.199 --> 01:27:41.800]  But...
[01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:46.510]  Where is Trump on this?
[01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:51.109]  Where is Speaker Johnson?
[01:27:52.329 --> 01:27:54.170]  Massey says we gotta remove Biden immediately.
[01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.510]  Senator Hawley says it.
[01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:59.470]  General Flynn says it.
[01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:00.850]  People say, well, then you want Kamala.
[01:28:00.930 --> 01:28:02.489]  No, we'll remove her too if she keeps doing that.
[01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:05.770]  We need investigations now of who's calling the shots.
[01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:06.630]  We know it's not them.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:14.119]  Just because she's horrible, doesn't mean you don't get rid of the criminal that's currently in there.
[01:28:14.199 --> 01:28:14.720]  You get rid of her too.
[01:28:14.859 --> 01:28:15.579]  Hell, impeach them both!
[01:28:23.819 --> 01:28:29.079]  So, I really want to keep living.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.079]  I really don't want to see the earth destroyed.
[01:28:32.119 --> 01:28:44.609]  I do care about the whales and the birdies and the crocodiles and the Tigers and the church mice and the kitty cats and the puppy dogs, but I really care about our children a lot more.
[01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:47.130]  And I have a grasp of history.
[01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:48.010]  I know many of you do.
[01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:49.850]  You're tuned in here because you actually care.
[01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:51.810]  You have survival instincts.
[01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:53.909]  You have a connection to God.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:29:04.930]  But I am moving into the pissed off area now at the Republicans and at our mandate for peace.
[01:29:08.119 --> 01:29:09.340]  People say, was it the border?
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.800]  Was it inflation?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:25.880]  Or was it World War III? Or was it that Harrison Walls were so disgusting and reviling that they lost in a landslide despite all their fraud?
[01:29:26.699 --> 01:29:29.880]  The landslide was so big it was still a small landslide.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:37.560]  The popular vote, the Electoral College, the Congress, Supreme Court trifecta.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:57.020]  Well, I can tell you with the crossover Democrats and liberals that were classical liberals and anti-war, a good aspect of old-fashioned liberals, that was the final game-changer was the World War III. Then was the open borders, and then was inflation from what I saw in weighing it all.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:58.880]  But they're all right up there as big issues.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.159]  But World War III is the biggest.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:13.250]  And Trump has a mandate for peace and ran trying to stop World War III. So I say, where is President Trump?
[01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:19.310]  Because I didn't say World War III officially had begun.
[01:30:20.279 --> 01:30:29.140]  When the West gets pulled in officially in the war, when Russia says you're officially in, we're officially at war with you, we're going to start hitting you with at least conventional weapons in NATO countries outside Ukraine.
[01:30:29.399 --> 01:30:30.699]  That's what they said is the bare minimum.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.659]  We're waiting for that shoe to drop.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.539]  And Lloyd Austin says, well, they're bluffing.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.300]  Maybe they are.
[01:30:35.579 --> 01:30:36.819]  Well, then what will NATO do?
[01:30:36.979 --> 01:30:38.159]  Keep pushing even harder?
[01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:38.840]  That's what they do.
[01:30:39.079 --> 01:30:40.880]  See, this is the escalation issue.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.420]  And it's the West doing it.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:31:01.390]  So now that the UK started bombing with storm shadows today, That crossed it in my mind, looking at the Russians' doctrine, that they are officially, in their view, at war with us, from their own statements, that if this would happen,
[01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:02.529]  they would be at war with us.
[01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:08.810]  And you see the Chinese running around, obviously cutting cables in the Baltic Sea, being chased by NATO navies.
[01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:11.250]  This is escalating quickly.
[01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:13.729]  Xi Jinping says prepare for total war.
[01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:20.390]  A month ago, imminently, North Korea says we're basically at war, blows up the bridges and railways into South Korea.
[01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.800]  Do you see where we are?
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.520]  So yeah, I love seeing Trump looking great.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.399]  Beautiful Texas day, blue sky, the crisp winter day.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:51.380]  Looking forward to the future, looking forward to innovation, looking at that amazing science, the great innovator, Maverick, Elon Musk.
[01:32:01.889 --> 01:32:03.130]  So, that's wonderful.
[01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.970]  Great achievement.
[01:32:06.529 --> 01:32:10.229]  This potential World War nuclear war is not good.
[01:32:10.369 --> 01:32:12.250]  So we're in World War III. The question is, will it go nuclear?
[01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:13.430]  We're on the trajectory.
[01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:14.470]  We're in the escalation.
[01:32:14.609 --> 01:32:14.930]  What do we do?
[01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:21.010]  Coming up, I'll play the clip that's so viral of Trump that everyone thinks is current.
[01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:21.649]  It's not.
[01:32:25.819 --> 01:32:27.180]  And I just keep checking.
[01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:28.760]  Do we have any new statements from Trump?
[01:32:31.739 --> 01:32:39.359]  Elon Musk has spoken out against World War III. I know Trump and Zelensky with Musk talked a few weeks ago when he was president-elect the day after.
[01:32:39.479 --> 01:32:40.000]  That's great.
[01:32:44.819 --> 01:32:48.560]  But now NATO, two NATO countries have hit Russia the last 48 hours.
[01:32:49.479 --> 01:32:49.920]  And...
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:05.560]  The NFL and Elon Musk space program are, not just on X, everywhere, bigger stories than World War III. And I know Elon would agree with me.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.460]  He's smart.
[01:33:06.619 --> 01:33:07.920]  It's common sense, logic.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.500]  We're not going to have a SpaceX program if there's a nuclear war.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.800]  So I want the Mars mission.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.539]  I love all that.
[01:33:14.699 --> 01:33:15.859]  I'm into it, man.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.659]  You know, I'm...
[01:33:18.409 --> 01:33:26.510]  It's like telling your wife if she's six months pregnant, hey, if you drink two bottles of vodka today, we're going to have a dead baby or totally mentally retarded one.
[01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:27.789]  Please don't do that.
[01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.550]  It's not that I don't care about the baby, the space program.
[01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:33.210]  I don't want to feed it cyanide.
[01:33:47.319 --> 01:33:48.640]  Statement from President Trump.
[01:33:50.739 --> 01:34:00.079]  I am pleased to announce that former Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker, who was a great guy from the great state of Iowa, will be the United States Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:05.439]  Matt is a strong warrior and loyal patriot who will ensure the United States' interests are advanced and defended.
[01:34:05.819 --> 01:34:10.699]  Matt will strengthen relationships with NATO allies and stand firm in the face of threats to peace and stability.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.220]  He'll put America first.
[01:34:12.539 --> 01:34:18.039]  I have full confidence in Matt's ability to represent the United States with strength, integrity, and wavering dedication.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:25.119]  I look forward to working closely with him as we continue to promote peace through strength, freedom, and prosperity around the world.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:38.140]  Matt is also a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa and is a graduate of the University of Iowa MBA, MBA, JD, where he played football and received the Big Ten Medal of Honor.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:39.640]  Wow, he got a football medal.
[01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:42.250]  Well, that's really, that's great.
[01:34:42.949 --> 01:34:43.710]  That's wonderful.
[01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:45.270]  We're back to football again.
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.989]  Can't get away from it.
[01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:51.630]  So, I wonder if we'll be playing football when the world ends.
[01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:55.149]  That'll kind of mess up your football right there.
[01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:59.369]  So, maybe Trump's got a peace deal behind the scenes.
[01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:00.710]  Maybe he's talking to Putin.
[01:35:00.829 --> 01:35:03.489]  They're about to announce a ceasefire because we don't have a real president right now.
[01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:13.630]  I mean, maybe I'll be surprised.
[01:35:13.789 --> 01:35:14.109]  You know what?
[01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:15.510]  I'm going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
[01:35:15.989 --> 01:35:16.949]  Here, let's...
[01:35:16.949 --> 01:35:22.409]  How about till tomorrow at noon?
[01:35:22.829 --> 01:35:24.630]  And then I'm going to start going crazy.
[01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:34.409]  Because Trump's got the bully pulpit, he's got the mandate, and he needs to be saying this needs to stop right now.
[01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:38.010]  Let's go back to that headline.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.340]  Trump's reported National Security Advisor supports bombing Russia in Afghanistan.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:55.100]  Mike Waltz has called for a credible military operation against Iran, wants to take the handcuffs off of Ukraine, and regrets ending the multi-generational war in Afghanistan.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.020]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.640]  Yeah, that guy's a Trump loyalist, but man, he's a neocon.
[01:36:01.439 --> 01:36:02.899]  Oh, God help us.
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.180]  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[01:36:08.029 --> 01:36:09.569]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:18.069]  And then an amazing group of guests are coming on that you don't want to miss in the next hour.
[01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:26.430]  Let's go ahead and start going to your phone calls.
[01:36:26.869 --> 01:36:27.710]  Multipass in Virginia.
[01:36:27.850 --> 01:36:28.649]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:36:30.069 --> 01:36:30.829]  Hey, Alex.
[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:32.189]  Good day to you.
[01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:37.229]  I called a couple months ago about preparations and having your group ready.
[01:36:38.529 --> 01:36:41.550]  I gotta say, now is definitely the time on that.
[01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:44.909]  People need to, you know, I know a lot of people know this already.
[01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:53.369]  We need to start upping our security postures, planning our routes on paper, primary, secondary, tertiary locations.
[01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.489]  Just have that ready.
[01:36:56.090 --> 01:37:02.029]  And, you know, I don't think these globalists are backing down this time, man.
[01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:07.850]  I think it's a final, you know, F you to the populace.
[01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:11.310]  Like, we got you, and we're not going to scare you anymore.
[01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:12.789]  We're going to carry through with this plan.
[01:37:13.029 --> 01:37:27.189]  Yeah, I remember 15 years ago, again, about 10 years ago, a bunch of countries, big ones, were very close to pulling out of the EU. And at the time, it was Herman von Rumpi was the head of the unelected EU commission that actually runs it.
[01:37:27.289 --> 01:37:30.909]  And then they have the parliament that's ceremonial.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:32.779]  Right.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.460]  And he said, if anyone leaves, we'll just start World War III with Russia.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.100]  So yeah, that's their fallback.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.539]  Oh, you're not going to eat bugs and let us cut your son's penis off?
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:48.659]  And England's taking the farms away from everybody, so's the Netherlands, so's Ireland, Sri Lanka, everywhere.
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:53.539]  If you don't accept us totally enslaving you and slowly killing you, we'll just have a nuclear war.
[01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:55.039]  Yeah, that's them.
[01:37:55.239 --> 01:37:56.199]  I mean, I agree with you.
[01:37:57.069 --> 01:37:59.130]  When all else fails, they're going to take us to war.
[01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.090]  We all know that.
[01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:01.989]  And lastly, I'll get off here.
[01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:06.470]  I was stationed out in a certain area in Kauai, Hawaii.
[01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:08.069]  I know you know.
[01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:13.489]  And we tested a lot of this stuff when it comes to defense and everything like that.
[01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:14.449]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:23.369]  But the few people I did talk to out there were very adamant, I guess, that, well, they just made it known.
[01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:25.470]  I mean, we're not up to defense.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.600]  Yeah, it's not a secret that the United States...
[01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:55.489]  Has anti-missile defense systems in space, aircraft, and on ships, and then has some major missile defense systems in CONUS. But the biggest one for a Pacific attack, and it's also offensive,
[01:38:55.829 --> 01:39:03.010]  is in those mountains, in those areas of Kauai, Oahu, and also on...
[01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:12.310]  The Big Island, they always called Wahoo the Big Island, but the actual big one And Kona.
[01:39:12.789 --> 01:39:15.850]  And yeah, people think Hawaii is safe.
[01:39:15.989 --> 01:39:18.250]  It's one of the main targets of Russia and China.
[01:39:18.449 --> 01:39:22.670]  It's just bristling with offensive and defensive weapons.
[01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:33.069]  And this has come out in congressional funding, so most of the details are secret, but we know there's particle beams, there's laser systems, there's anti-missile systems.
[01:39:33.729 --> 01:39:35.289]  It's all over those islands.
[01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:45.949]  And yeah, the Russians have stuff that's A lot faster and a lot better, at least to what the general secret military knows about their stuff.
[01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:48.569]  Super secret above that.
[01:39:49.329 --> 01:39:53.949]  But yeah, and you're saying from folks you talked to out there when you were working out there, that's basically what they were saying?
[01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:56.449]  Yeah, that's correct, yeah.
[01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:59.350]  And it's just, it's not up to par nearly where it should be.
[01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:02.689]  Well, I mean, how do you stop...
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.680]  5,000 Russian missiles coming in.
[01:40:06.279 --> 01:40:07.380]  Yeah, you don't.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:09.939]  And they don't stop ours either.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:10.899]  That's why it's ridiculous.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.699]  Alright, well, keep on it, Alex.
[01:40:14.859 --> 01:40:15.539]  God bless, man.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:15.979]  Thank you.
[01:40:16.279 --> 01:40:16.560]  Thank you.
[01:40:17.079 --> 01:40:27.680]  Yeah, when they say not up to par, let's say there's 1,000 anti-ballistic missile missiles in Kauai, and that's a high number.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:30.979]  Alright.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:33.420]  How's that stop?
[01:40:36.559 --> 01:40:37.079]  Thousands.
[01:40:37.079 --> 01:40:37.899]  And thousands.
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:42.020]  And how does it stop cruise missiles that fly 10 feet above the ground?
[01:40:43.779 --> 01:40:45.539]  And the answer is it doesn't.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:49.479]  So, there we are.
[01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:54.119]  And don't worry, the globalists say it's all a big bluff.
[01:40:54.819 --> 01:40:56.180]  So they're bombing Russia.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.859]  That sounds psychotic.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.439]  Steve in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:00.920]  Thanks for holding.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.479]  Alex.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.439]  It's been a pleasure talking to you many times over the years.
[01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:12.960]  And the only thing that's going to stop this, I'd like to lead us in a short prayer, please.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:13.739]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:41:14.979 --> 01:41:20.720]  Our Heavenly Father, we ask right now your divine intervention.
[01:41:21.859 --> 01:41:23.479]  We pray for peace.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:31.340]  And please, dear Lord, if it be thy will, intervene and stop this madness.
[01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:41.689]  I want to pray for Alex and his whole crew, Roger Stone, and our President Trump, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:42.529]  Amen.
[01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:43.010]  Amen.
[01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:48.529]  And it can't be stopped, Alex.
[01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:54.729]  Matthew 24, Revelation 19, it's all prophesied.
[01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:59.609]  You know, when the Deagle Report came out, what year was that?
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.199]  Almost 20 years ago.
[01:42:04.039 --> 01:42:04.220]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:18.060]  And then, I mean, they were already planning to depopulate the earth, and they're talking about killing 250 million people in the United States.
[01:42:18.239 --> 01:42:29.060]  So right there, I mean, the only thing we can all do right now is pray to our Heavenly Father and just ask for His divine intervention.
[01:42:29.989 --> 01:42:34.090]  I just, you know, what more can you say?
[01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:39.590]  I mean, everything that you have said in the last 20 years has all come true.
[01:42:39.869 --> 01:42:41.189]  And I'm like you.
[01:42:41.369 --> 01:42:42.590]  I'm freaked out here.
[01:42:42.710 --> 01:42:50.069]  I'm in upstate South Carolina, and, you know, people are worried about stuff that doesn't matter.
[01:42:50.310 --> 01:43:00.119]  And, you know, I'll be all right here for a while, but it's like you say, once the nuclear reactors start melting down, We're all totally screwed.
[01:43:04.779 --> 01:43:06.159]  It's totally satanic.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:06.939]  God bless you, sir.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.119]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rich in New Jersey.
[01:43:10.239 --> 01:43:10.760]  Rich, go ahead.
[01:43:11.739 --> 01:43:12.520]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:13.340]  How you doing today?
[01:43:13.619 --> 01:43:15.439]  I just want to make a few quick points.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:21.880]  Number one, even though Trump is our guy, we have to hold him accountable to this.
[01:43:22.039 --> 01:43:31.649]  And no matter what, how many good things he does, if this isn't the number one thing on his plate, If it isn't, it needs to be, and everybody that's working with him.
[01:43:32.029 --> 01:43:41.449]  Now, what I'm going to tell you is, the Logan Act means nothing to me, because there's not going to be a Logan Act if we are decimated by nuclear destruction.
[01:43:41.729 --> 01:43:43.229]  They've got to throw it out the window.
[01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:44.829]  We have the survival of mankind.
[01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:52.090]  Well, listen, I love Roger, but when he was on and said, well, Logan Act, he is the president-elect.
[01:43:52.489 --> 01:43:55.029]  President-elects talk to world leaders all the time.
[01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:56.930]  They make policy statements all the time.
[01:43:57.170 --> 01:43:58.710]  That's different in the law.
[01:43:58.909 --> 01:44:01.569]  And you've seen Mass and everybody come out and say that, too.
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:02.869]  So just let's move past that.
[01:44:03.539 --> 01:44:12.739]  You also had John Kerry and Obama when they were out of office running around sabotaging Trump's policies publicly and doing shadow diplomacy.
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:15.020]  So it's all crap.
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.300]  But I totally agree with what you're saying.
[01:44:17.539 --> 01:44:21.520]  And so that's where we're at.
[01:44:21.659 --> 01:44:23.380]  And yeah, I mean, I think...
[01:44:24.329 --> 01:44:27.510]  We're two days into this now without a Trump statement.
[01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:28.489]  Okay?
[01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:30.869]  People, everybody wants to hear this.
[01:44:31.289 --> 01:44:33.670]  And, I mean, I want to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
[01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:37.550]  I mean, maybe he's got some peace deal almost done, and he's about to do it.
[01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:40.909]  And the globalists are mad, so they had England strike again.
[01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:44.550]  And so, look, I'm going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, but I'm getting concerned.
[01:44:45.949 --> 01:44:51.090]  Yeah, I mean, you know, like you said, everybody's concerned about the NFL. All these...
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:15.279]  Oh yeah, last night, and my wife's the right person awake and everything, but she heard me on the phone talking to some people.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.359]  And I was, you know, in my office, but she could hear it in the bedroom.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:28.899]  And she just said, I'm so sick of all this World War III. I'm so sick of, you know, just constantly, can't you ever relax?
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.279]  I'm like, listen.
[01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:33.890]  I'm doing this because I have to know what's going on.
[01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:38.390]  We're in this trouble because men are not responsible like they used to be.
[01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.909]  I am a responsible person.
[01:45:39.909 --> 01:45:41.229]  I am a serious person.
[01:45:41.409 --> 01:45:45.869]  I said to her, I said, God has given me this position to stand up.
[01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:48.090]  And so that's why I work so hard.
[01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:48.970]  She's like, yeah, I know.
[01:45:49.369 --> 01:45:52.170]  She's like, you're going to kill yourself if you're working 20 hours a day.
[01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:54.210]  No, I'm stronger than ever.
[01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:55.750]  And I'm not trashing my wife.
[01:45:55.829 --> 01:45:56.890]  I'm just saying, yes, I get it.
[01:45:56.949 --> 01:45:57.409]  And I get it.
[01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.890]  Look, look, look.
[01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:59.789]  It's not just women.
[01:45:59.970 --> 01:46:01.710]  It's men in general don't want to hear this.
[01:46:01.829 --> 01:46:02.750]  And I get it, people.
[01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:05.750]  I mean, I can play you funny leftist clips all day.
[01:46:06.010 --> 01:46:08.510]  Here, I meant to play this yesterday and have some fun.
[01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:16.430]  I've got Governor Tim Walz has come out and made an announcement.
[01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:18.550]  And so he's resurfaced.
[01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:19.810]  We'll find that clip from yesterday.
[01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:21.909]  We'll It's on yesterday's list.
[01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:23.449]  We'll play that in a moment.
[01:46:23.569 --> 01:46:24.470]  Of course, it's not Tim Walsh.
[01:46:24.569 --> 01:46:24.949]  It's a joke.
[01:46:25.829 --> 01:46:28.850]  But, I mean, I can make this show ultra-entertaining.
[01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:32.310]  I've got all this crazy stuff to cover, and I can cover this leftist thing and that.
[01:46:32.369 --> 01:46:35.090]  I mean, I've got all this insane stuff to show how bad they are, how nuts they are.
[01:46:35.710 --> 01:46:37.569]  They're taking everybody's farms in the Western world.
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:42.989]  Trudeau tells G20 that fighting climate change, quote, is more important than rent, food, and kids.
[01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:44.729]  I mean, it's war against us.
[01:46:44.789 --> 01:46:45.510]  But even that...
[01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:54.029]  We're good to go.
[01:47:09.659 --> 01:47:11.840]  And I'm just like, sorry, I don't talk about that.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.699]  Because it does not enter my brain.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.279]  And I get people need to have a distraction.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.039]  I'm not saying you're even bad.
[01:47:19.159 --> 01:47:21.319]  But see, I'm on the other end of this.
[01:47:21.699 --> 01:47:22.840]  This is what I do.
[01:47:22.979 --> 01:47:24.060]  This is all I do.
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:27.140]  And that's why we are Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:47:27.279 --> 01:47:27.779]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:29.039 --> 01:47:30.380]  Yeah, here is Tim Walz.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.420]  The governor has finally resurfaced after losing the election.
[01:47:33.539 --> 01:47:34.260]  Hasn't been seen in weeks.
[01:47:34.319 --> 01:47:35.039]  He finally resurfaced.
[01:47:35.159 --> 01:47:35.380]  Here he is.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.020]  And do you know how hard that is to know that?
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:45.159]  To go out there being myself?
[01:47:47.359 --> 01:47:49.840]  I don't even think I could be myself anymore.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.739]  And what do you think that does to be in my community?
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.439]  That we can't even go out and be free anymore?
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:09.789]  Because all of you people, the ones who voted for that man, You are so emboldened now, aren't you?
[01:48:10.069 --> 01:48:12.930]  So emboldened to do and say what you want.
[01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:18.329]  Make people feel any way that you think that they should feel.
[01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:23.390]  This is a sad time.
[01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:27.130]  These are mentally ill people.
[01:48:27.409 --> 01:48:28.850]  This person's a real person.
[01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:31.109]  That's enough.
[01:48:31.869 --> 01:48:33.949]  In the archive, we'll put the full clip in.
[01:48:34.069 --> 01:48:42.189]  But they think because you won't accept them, you're not even doing anything to them, that because they're totally upset and mentally ill, that you're causing the mental illness.
[01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:43.350]  You're causing their depression.
[01:48:44.210 --> 01:48:45.909]  No, you are literally a clown.
[01:48:46.029 --> 01:48:48.430]  These dudes that say they're women don't even look like women.
[01:48:48.569 --> 01:48:51.069]  They literally look like space alien clowns.
[01:48:51.329 --> 01:48:59.510]  And I guess that's what you see before the end of the world is just space alien clowns everywhere, just cutting children's penises off and just total nutballs everywhere.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.539]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:02.760]  Come back with more of your calls.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.020]  And Larry Pickney's coming on.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:06.960]  We've got Naomi Wolf and more.
[01:49:07.789 --> 01:49:10.510]  By the way, thealexjonesstore.com is not owned by us.
[01:49:10.529 --> 01:49:11.470]  It can't be shut down.
[01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:12.189]  That's our sponsor.
[01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.909]  Please support it.
[01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:28.250]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:33.789]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public and people can just put in one bid.
[01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:37.649]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:42.010]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:49:42.069 --> 01:49:42.649]  Who knows?
[01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:45.630]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:51.729]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved, filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[01:49:52.449 --> 01:50:00.270]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:50:00.529 --> 01:50:04.710]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:07.770]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:19.109]  With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network where we won't miss a beat.
[01:50:19.289 --> 01:50:33.869]  If you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[01:50:34.289 --> 01:50:38.069]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.449]  But that's going to get announced.
[01:50:39.569 --> 01:50:41.649]  The winner here in just a few days.
[01:50:41.810 --> 01:50:45.829]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:47.470]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[01:50:47.649 --> 01:50:49.310]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:50.470]  So now...
[01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:58.489]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:58.850 --> 01:51:04.390]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:05.850]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:06.989]  It's a beautiful truck.

[01:52:59.250 --> 01:53:01.130]  It's so exciting to see the big win with Trump.
[01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:06.789]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[01:53:07.029 --> 01:53:07.949]  God bless you all.
[01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:09.109]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:12.170]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:19.899]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls here for a few minutes, then to Larry Pinckney, and then to Naomi Wolf, and then back to your phone calls.
[01:53:20.119 --> 01:53:21.279]  There's a ton of news in the fourth hour.
[01:53:22.399 --> 01:53:23.800]  This is the third hour right now.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:27.140]  But I'm so focused on stopping nuclear war.
[01:53:27.239 --> 01:53:33.119]  We're already in World War III. All the elements and facts are there, and Russian statements and doctrines basically have said that.
[01:53:33.579 --> 01:53:35.300]  That we're the first to let you know.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:38.899]  I think you already knew it, but I'm just, you know, that's how world wars start.
[01:53:39.039 --> 01:53:39.460]  You know, it's later.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.640]  They go, oh, this is a world war.
[01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:49.029]  If I don't ask for your support, we won't be here.
[01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:52.949]  So just briefly again, there has been massive confusion.
[01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:54.149]  The Onion did not buy this.
[01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:56.250]  We've been back in the building since Thursday or since Friday.
[01:53:56.449 --> 01:53:57.489]  It's all a hoax.
[01:53:57.789 --> 01:53:58.649]  Read our lawsuits.
[01:53:58.770 --> 01:53:59.350]  They're in deep trouble.
[01:53:59.449 --> 01:54:00.409]  The judge is totally pissed.
[01:54:00.529 --> 01:54:01.350]  They'll probably go to prison.
[01:54:01.569 --> 01:54:02.949]  I'm not joking about that.
[01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:05.729]  I don't just say stuff because I want to sound cool.
[01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:16.729]  But, them saying they own InfoWars, we're now at 80 plus percent no funding what we regularly bring in at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:17.329 --> 01:54:20.149]  It's there, it's shipping out, you get your order in, it's going to ship.
[01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:23.569]  It'd violate all sorts of federal law if they took us over and didn't ship out what was there.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.239]  But the place to support is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:54:27.319 --> 01:54:28.359]  That is not owned by me.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.539]  They have no claim.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.779]  It's in Arkansas.
[01:54:31.119 --> 01:54:39.500]  That's where they make the shirts, the knives, the posters, the collectibles, the fundraisers, the collectible InfoWars coin.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.920]  We need your support.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.079]  These are great products.
[01:54:42.199 --> 01:54:43.579]  The supplements are game changers.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.319]  The CMOS is insanely good.
[01:54:45.479 --> 01:54:47.180]  The Ultimate Superfood is so good for your whole body.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.020]  So amazing.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:48.880]  You want to be on it.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:49.279]  I'm on it.
[01:54:49.279 --> 01:54:51.420]  It's why I look so healthy and good because I'm gobbling it.
[01:54:52.579 --> 01:54:54.020]  Go to the Alex Jones store.com.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.560]  And for the Alex Jones network or whatever comes next, and I believe we're going to stay here.
[01:54:57.699 --> 01:54:58.439]  In fact, I know it.
[01:54:58.539 --> 01:54:59.180]  There's no way.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:01.880]  In my view.
[01:55:03.079 --> 01:55:09.560]  We still need funds now more than ever because it's going to take people a while to figure out that Infowars store isn't owned by these liars.
[01:55:09.859 --> 01:55:16.619]  I mean, they hijacked the building with a federal agent without a warrant, a judge's order, anything.
[01:55:16.979 --> 01:55:18.300]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:19.779]  Okay?
[01:55:20.829 --> 01:55:23.270]  So, the alishonestore.com.
[01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:26.029]  You want CMOS. You want HydroForce.
[01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:27.050]  You want the Gut Cleanse.
[01:55:27.090 --> 01:55:27.970]  You want our probiotic.
[01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:30.010]  They're all the best private label top brands out there.
[01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:32.109]  It means top brands already there, already loved.
[01:55:32.210 --> 01:55:32.729]  We go get it.
[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:33.449]  Private label it.
[01:55:33.529 --> 01:55:34.930]  To make sure you're getting something badass.
[01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:37.470]  So you get something badass from us and you fund liberty.
[01:55:39.569 --> 01:55:43.850]  So, I can't sit here like the world's going to end.
[01:55:43.989 --> 01:55:45.090]  That's what's kind of happening.
[01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:46.329]  Potentially.
[01:55:46.689 --> 01:55:48.890]  And then just stop plugging or stop...
[01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:53.310]  You know, exercising or stop, you know, paying the crew.
[01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:56.369]  And I think we're going to make it through this.
[01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:58.090]  I find it hard to believe we're going to have nuclear war.
[01:55:58.210 --> 01:56:00.649]  But there's that normalcy bias that the globalists have.
[01:56:00.710 --> 01:56:01.430]  They think the same thing.
[01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:02.529]  Or maybe they want nuclear war.
[01:56:02.609 --> 01:56:03.270]  I think they probably do.
[01:56:03.329 --> 01:56:04.949]  They just killed 30 million people with poison shots.
[01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:06.550]  Big breaking news on that coming up.
[01:56:07.329 --> 01:56:10.890]  So, I cannot do this without you.
[01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:13.409]  I don't even know why I need to describe this to people.
[01:56:14.659 --> 01:56:17.579]  This is not a Netflix show or entertainment show.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.739]  This is not fiction.
[01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:32.939]  I am the number one hated broadcast by The Globalist because we've been number one for English-speaking news and analysis in 2016, 2017, 2018.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.760]  Number one bigger than Rogan, anybody.
[01:56:35.939 --> 01:56:36.800]  That's admitted.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.619]  And now with X coming back and everything else, we are back to levels never before at...
[01:56:43.279 --> 01:56:44.779]  We're pushing that I know of.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:45.600]  That means there's a lot more.
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.000]  I said 80 million.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.000]  I just can't believe it.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:52.600]  100 million views right now, conservatively on X alone.
[01:56:53.319 --> 01:56:57.460]  We're on 450-something stations now, getting like five, six a day.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.300]  It's getting insane.
[01:56:59.159 --> 01:57:00.619]  I can't even quantify that.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:01.539]  That's tens of millions.
[01:57:01.979 --> 01:57:04.439]  We are just leaking out into everything else.
[01:57:04.539 --> 01:57:05.500]  The censorship isn't working.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.460]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:57:07.979 --> 01:57:12.180]  Okay, so just we are wrecking their ass right now because of your support.
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.300]  So I am defending myself.
[01:57:14.619 --> 01:57:15.960]  I am defending you.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:17.180]  I am your soldier.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:18.539]  I am committed to you.
[01:57:18.939 --> 01:57:21.880]  But I cannot do this without you.
[01:57:22.699 --> 01:57:24.180]  So keep sharing the articles.
[01:57:24.399 --> 01:57:25.220]  Keep sharing the videos.
[01:57:25.399 --> 01:57:26.579]  You're getting an A-plus there.
[01:57:27.359 --> 01:57:38.039]  But when we're getting 70, 80, 90 million views a day, and we were doing okay on the fines, But it's literally one-tenth of one percent buying anything.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:40.659]  Everybody wants Patriot T-shirts.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.060]  Everybody should have these amazing supplements.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.899]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[01:57:45.159 --> 01:57:48.399]  So everybody out there, this is real here.
[01:57:48.939 --> 01:57:50.039]  This is your broadcast.
[01:57:50.279 --> 01:57:51.659]  You need to keep it on the air.
[01:57:51.779 --> 01:57:53.079]  So please, support.
[01:57:53.779 --> 01:57:55.539]  This isn't you giving something.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.359]  This is you gaining something for your future.
[01:57:57.659 --> 01:57:58.960]  This is you getting in the arena.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.500]  This is hardcore.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.060]  This is history happening.
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:03.960]  We've turned the tide.
[01:58:04.199 --> 01:58:05.140]  We've got to keep pushing.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:06.300]  Thank you for your support.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:07.100]  I salute you.
[01:58:07.399 --> 01:58:07.779]  Stay with us.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:08.479]  Back in 60 Seconds.
[01:58:08.659 --> 01:58:09.939]  Well, it's cut and dry.
[01:58:10.079 --> 01:58:11.640]  The globalists don't want Trump coming in.
[01:58:11.699 --> 01:58:12.520]  They don't want peace.
[01:58:12.659 --> 01:58:14.439]  Their big global bubble is coming to an end.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:21.600]  They want a global cashless society, central big digital currency, social credit score, and they're trying to start a nuclear war.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:31.810]  They've already started World War III. When you have an alliance of Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran at least, In a mutual defense pact, you've got North Korean troops fighting now.
[01:58:31.930 --> 01:58:34.109]  You've got NATO troops battling Russians for years.
[01:58:34.289 --> 01:58:39.609]  Now you've got the US and the UK raining down high-powered missiles inside Russia.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.800]  If Russia starts accepting missiles coming in, they could easily be nuclear-tipped.
[01:58:43.859 --> 01:58:47.979]  They could be snuck-attacked, which NATO says they reserve the right to do with nuclear weapons.
[01:58:48.439 --> 01:58:51.279]  Russia said if they delivered the missiles, it would be an act of war.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.899]  Well, that means we're at war with Russia.
[01:58:54.199 --> 01:58:57.460]  The question is, we're in World War III. It hasn't been announced yet.
[01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:58.359]  You heard it here first.
[01:58:59.859 --> 01:59:01.319]  That's a fact, not my opinion.
[01:59:01.319 --> 01:59:02.300]  All the doctrines there.
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:05.600]  The military escalation.
[01:59:06.729 --> 01:59:07.890]  How do we de-escalate?
[01:59:08.029 --> 01:59:15.050]  How do we stop it from becoming Thermal Nuclear World War III? Larry Pinckney has been coming on the show for at least 20 years.
[01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:16.350]  Good friend of mine.
[01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:19.289]  Black Activist WG.org.
[01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:38.850]  And Larry Pinckney is a veteran of the Black Panther Party, not the new Black Panther Party run by the Democrats and the FBI. Former Minister of Interior, Republic of New Africa, former political prisoner, and the only American to successfully self-authored civil political rights cases before the United Nations under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
[01:59:39.670 --> 01:59:42.989]  And he joins us now, blackcommentator.com.
[01:59:43.770 --> 01:59:46.369]  Larry, always great to have you on, my friend.
[01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:49.590]  And I need to get you back because you're hard to get on for a full hour soon.
[01:59:49.710 --> 01:59:52.310]  We got Naomi Wolf coming up here in just about 25 minutes, my brother.
[01:59:52.710 --> 01:59:58.369]  But the election, the victory, now obviously the ultimate deep state plan.
[01:59:58.829 --> 02:00:00.770]  Where do you want to start first here, my friend?
[02:00:00.829 --> 02:00:01.430]  And you've got the floor.
[02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.649]  Thank you.
[02:00:02.850 --> 02:00:05.789]  First, where I want to start first is to tell you I love you.
[02:00:06.369 --> 02:00:08.489]  To stay strong, to maintain.
[02:00:08.630 --> 02:00:11.909]  We are so proud of you, my brother.
[02:00:12.449 --> 02:00:13.510]  Kick ass!
[02:00:13.909 --> 02:00:15.310]  We're proud of you.
[02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:22.869]  Not only you, but the crew and the crew's family, because you're all going through this together.
[02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:27.489]  And let me say this, kudos and salutations.
[02:00:28.050 --> 02:00:29.970]  To the great audience.
[02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:30.829]  Okay?
[02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.569]  That's where I wanted to start.
[02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:39.350]  Now, if I may, with all due respect, I want to hurry on to two matters.
[02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:46.489]  One, what you've been talking about repeatedly, and it's extremely important.
[02:00:46.909 --> 02:00:48.869]  Alex, let me put it this way.
[02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:56.649]  We are in the first phase of the Third World War.
[02:00:57.579 --> 02:01:14.659]  When, and I hope to God we won't, but if and when we enter the final phase of the Third World War, it will in fact be a global thermonuclear holocaust.
[02:01:14.859 --> 02:01:21.140]  But we are already In the first phase of World War III. So you're absolutely correct.
[02:01:21.479 --> 02:01:29.239]  And people, all of us, all of us need to be cognizant, need to be aware of the danger.
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:43.020]  This maniac, this senile old mean bastard and the people he surrounds himself with, and I'm talking about our so-called current president.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:46.199]  Please be aware.
[02:01:47.130 --> 02:01:48.050]  Be aware.
[02:01:48.250 --> 02:01:49.829]  Contact your Congress members.
[02:01:50.029 --> 02:01:53.989]  Tell them to get rid of this threat.
[02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.689]  Now!
[02:01:56.489 --> 02:01:57.970]  We only have minutes.
[02:01:58.289 --> 02:02:00.029]  We only have days, if that.
[02:02:00.670 --> 02:02:10.609]  So, having said that, I want to express my supreme gratitude to President Donald J. Trump.
[02:02:10.789 --> 02:02:11.729]  President-elect!
[02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:13.270]  President-elect!
[02:02:13.489 --> 02:02:14.149]  Sure you're right.
[02:02:14.789 --> 02:02:26.109]  You know, and Pray, pray that he is protected and his illustrious family, that they are protected.
[02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:31.850]  We are living, any way you look at it, in some very precarious times.
[02:02:33.090 --> 02:02:38.130]  Let us not think that the war is over.
[02:02:38.449 --> 02:02:40.770]  It's only just begun.
[02:02:40.909 --> 02:02:47.670]  We have won a major battle, but we have not won the war.
[02:02:47.869 --> 02:02:51.649]  We intend to, but we must intensify.
[02:02:51.909 --> 02:03:02.550]  There's an old gospel song that came out back in the day, sung by the Edwin Hawkins, Oh, Happy Day!
[02:03:02.770 --> 02:03:09.130]  And that's what I said to myself when I saw the election results.
[02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:10.689]  Oh, Happy Day!
[02:03:10.909 --> 02:03:21.829]  But in that song, Oh, Happy Day, it says, if you listen to it by the Edwin Hawkins singers, it says, fight and pray.
[02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:27.229]  I repeat, the refrain in the song says, fight and pray.
[02:03:27.789 --> 02:03:32.090]  So we must intensify, intensify, intensify.
[02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.829]  Okay?
[02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:34.390]  Oh, happy day!
[02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:37.810]  But we've got to fight and pray every day.
[02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:49.630]  Next thing that I'd like to deal with, my brother Alex, is Infowars, Alex Jones, AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:03:49.810 --> 02:04:04.539]  In other words, I want to deal with the fact that you, your crew, their families, The audience are undergoing unmitigated, sustained attack.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:08.560]  We are so proud of all of you.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.779]  We are very proud of you.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.500]  When I say we, I'm talking about we, the ordinary people.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:20.779]  I once said to you on your show, Alex, that you are the Paul Revere.
[02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:23.569]  You are the Paul Revere.
[02:04:23.829 --> 02:04:30.409]  And we the people are with you, just as we are with Donald J. Trump, President Trump.
[02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:38.310]  And let's understand that these maniacs, I mean, they're like political orcs.
[02:04:38.630 --> 02:04:42.890]  You know, if anybody's familiar with Tolkien, the orcs, that's what they're like.
[02:04:43.329 --> 02:04:44.770]  Political orcs.
[02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:46.369]  They have no conscience.
[02:04:46.810 --> 02:04:48.409]  They have no conscience.
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.279]  They have no decency at all!
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.100]  Okay, we know that.
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:57.399]  So we have to deal with them accordingly.
[02:04:57.939 --> 02:05:00.800]  We must remember what we're doing.
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.420]  And what we must do, we must remember.
[02:05:04.619 --> 02:05:11.779]  And we must always remember what these creatures that we're up against are capable of doing.
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:12.899]  Anything!
[02:05:13.609 --> 02:05:14.250]  Anything.
[02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:24.189]  Otherwise, right now, we wouldn't be so concerned about a global thermonuclear holocaust.
[02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:28.369]  And we better damn well be concerned about it, because this is real.
[02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:32.670]  And one more thing, if I may say, my brother Alex, one more thing.
[02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:37.470]  This is all about sabotage.
[02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:39.609]  Let's face it.
[02:05:39.949 --> 02:05:46.229]  That's what the leadership of the Democrat Party is all about.
[02:05:46.529 --> 02:05:47.289]  Sabotage.
[02:05:47.750 --> 02:06:02.789]  How in the heck could they possibly have thought that by calling people garbage, calling people deplorables, telling black people that they're not black if they don't vote Democrat,
[02:06:03.329 --> 02:06:07.050]  how in the heck could they have thought that would win the election?
[02:06:07.789 --> 02:06:09.930]  These people are insane.
[02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:13.050]  And that's the scary part about it.
[02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:19.649]  But like the good song says, oh happy day, we have got to fight and pray.
[02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:22.189]  So carry on, my good brother.
[02:06:22.569 --> 02:06:27.350]  Carry on our team with you, Alex.
[02:06:27.729 --> 02:06:31.130]  All of you, carry on, maintain, intensify.
[02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:40.020]  My greetings to all of you, to Daria, to Owen, to Chase, to all of you.
[02:06:40.239 --> 02:06:45.140]  I'm looking at my little pad here, and I know I left a whole bunch of people out there.
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:59.899]  Listen, we love you too, Larry, and you fought through a lot of stuff here, and I don't bring up our own case because there's so many big issues here, but it is a window into this, and now even top lawyers that are pundits, even liberals have gone and looked at our filing that has the documents.
[02:07:00.489 --> 02:07:06.189]  The Justice Department in six months has tried twice without a court order to close the building and kick us out.
[02:07:06.670 --> 02:07:14.909]  And then they just showed up here and turned off the internet and didn't even have a court order and then freaked out the next day and said, you can come back.
[02:07:15.029 --> 02:07:16.109]  Well, they didn't give it back to us.
[02:07:16.170 --> 02:07:16.689]  They stole it.
[02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:20.750]  That is emblematic of how desperate they are.
[02:07:20.850 --> 02:07:26.350]  And they admitted and sent an email when I first declared bankruptcy two years ago to my lawyers from the Justice Department.
[02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:28.649]  Because they have a bankruptcy division.
[02:07:28.649 --> 02:07:29.829]  Folks don't really know about that.
[02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:32.270]  And said, Alex Jones will not prevail.
[02:07:32.489 --> 02:07:34.170]  He will not be afforded the bankruptcy system.
[02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:37.789]  So they are so naked.
[02:07:37.789 --> 02:07:41.489]  And that's just a little microcosm of what they're doing.
[02:07:41.489 --> 02:07:43.029]  But it shows they're not all powerful.
[02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:44.130]  Here we are in the building.
[02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:45.789]  And then they were so arrogant.
[02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:51.029]  They gave my lawyers and gave the documents where they rigged everything.
[02:07:51.409 --> 02:07:53.789]  I mean, like you said, they are...
[02:07:54.609 --> 02:07:58.390]  A mixture of total arrogance, stupidity, and desperation.
[02:07:59.029 --> 02:08:00.069]  Right, right.
[02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:06.010]  And the thing is, is that they thought that you and the crew, they thought they...
[02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:07.899]  You are just back down.
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:08.880]  Go away.
[02:08:09.279 --> 02:08:10.119]  Jump in a hole.
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:11.859]  They are wrong.
[02:08:12.039 --> 02:08:13.899]  They were wrong and they are wrong.
[02:08:14.039 --> 02:08:14.819]  But you're right.
[02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:18.800]  It's a matter of them being one, arrogant.
[02:08:19.079 --> 02:08:26.220]  I mean, I've never in my many years of life, I've never seen anything like this.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.439]  Anything, not even near it.
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:32.500]  So we've got to, and I keep saying this, my brother, and I mean it.
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:34.880]  We've got to intensify.
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:35.899]  We must.
[02:08:36.239 --> 02:08:38.539]  Because everything is at stake.
[02:08:39.079 --> 02:08:43.119]  And, you know, Alex, you are a symbol.
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:49.039]  You are one of the leaders, if you will.
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.960]  You might not like it, but that's just the way it is, bro.
[02:08:52.359 --> 02:08:55.680]  And we must support you.
[02:08:55.859 --> 02:08:59.319]  Because by supporting you, what are we doing?
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:01.979]  We are supporting ourselves.
[02:09:02.539 --> 02:09:03.220]  Okay?
[02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:26.579]  I know you will, but I would remind the audience that we must do everything we can, give our dollars, our pennies, our everything, okay, to keep Alex on the X. Let me speak to that because I see comments on X. Most people understand it.
[02:09:26.779 --> 02:09:30.460]  Some go, why is this guy always begging for money?
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.420]  We're like Trump, but smaller.
[02:09:33.359 --> 02:09:38.000]  We're under constant lawfare, constant criminal indictment.
[02:09:38.319 --> 02:09:44.260]  I've had five grand juries trying to put me in prison But they couldn't find anything because I'm literally a straight-laced guy.
[02:09:44.420 --> 02:09:45.880]  And by the grace of God, it didn't happen.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.239]  They put Owen in prison.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.359]  They put Steve Bannon in prison.
[02:09:50.039 --> 02:09:53.460]  And it's only because we've had a lot of money.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:54.300]  They admitted in court.
[02:09:55.210 --> 02:09:56.189]  They file it.
[02:09:56.510 --> 02:10:01.630]  The last number was upwards of $80 million attacking me.
[02:10:01.710 --> 02:10:04.430]  The top Democrat law firms in the last seven years.
[02:10:04.449 --> 02:10:07.189]  We've spent, we've done the math, $15.5 million.
[02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:10.510]  You think, folks, I want to come up here and beg you?
[02:10:10.630 --> 02:10:13.050]  You think I want to spend this on lawyers?
[02:10:13.289 --> 02:10:15.390]  We held out this long.
[02:10:15.569 --> 02:10:17.770]  Giuliani was destroyed in one year by these people.
[02:10:17.850 --> 02:10:20.329]  We've held out seven years because you held out.
[02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:22.170]  And they do see it as a symbol.
[02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:25.109]  And we do reach 70, 80 million people again today.
[02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:29.859]  And they're scared of it because of our guests and the crew and the reports.
[02:10:29.859 --> 02:10:31.579]  And they know we've got their numbers.
[02:10:31.779 --> 02:10:35.800]  So people that don't know history and war think, oh, that's just another talk show.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:36.180]  No, no, no.
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:38.279]  The enemy sees it as a symbol.
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:40.739]  And if they're able to take me off the air, they've said it.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:45.779]  They're going to masquerade as me and literally create a straw man to hurt people.
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:56.100]  So instead of this broadcast being not just me, but the broadcast of folk legend, they want to kill that legend because they don't It's like the Bob Marley song, shot the sheriff.
[02:10:56.439 --> 02:10:59.180]  And the sheriff sees him grow, he kills him.
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.319]  When they see the leader, they need to kill him.
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:05.039]  That goes back in every culture, in every system of oppression.
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:06.239]  I know you're quite a historian.
[02:11:06.479 --> 02:11:13.319]  Can you explain to people, this is an ancient fight where they kill our leaders and they're trying to destroy me and shut me down.
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:19.220]  And they've said, as soon as they get me off the air, they are, when they think I don't have support, kill me or put me in prison.
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.300]  But this isn't about me.
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.539]  I don't even care about that.
[02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:28.289]  Okay, I do want to keep fighting, but they need to understand when Trump says they're not trying to get me, they got to get through me to get to you.
[02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.050]  He's not just saying that!
[02:11:30.789 --> 02:11:31.750]  Right, right, right.
[02:11:31.930 --> 02:11:32.810]  And you know what?
[02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:48.149]  I've oftentimes talked on your show about COINTELPRO, the counterintelligence program to frame, to discredit, to imprison, and yes, to murder, dissidents.
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:12:03.100]  Well, what we've been watching, particularly as it relates not only to President Donald J. Trump and his family, but to you, Alex, is Cointelpro on steroids.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.060]  On steroids.
[02:12:05.819 --> 02:12:07.920]  And here we are, 2024.
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:15.340]  This is the year 2024, and we're still fighting these demonic arcs.
[02:12:15.789 --> 02:12:22.850]  We've got to understand what and who these creatures are, these people are.
[02:12:23.069 --> 02:12:26.850]  So, yes, this is a long struggle.
[02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:28.789]  A long struggle.
[02:12:29.010 --> 02:12:35.270]  But by supporting, Alex, we are supporting ourselves.
[02:12:35.550 --> 02:12:37.590]  We must do this.
[02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:42.930]  And later to interrupt, you gotta come back for a full hour soon, promise, even tomorrow if you can.
[02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.970]  Explain to people what a long struggle means.
[02:12:46.029 --> 02:12:47.949]  And I know they know, but they don't really get it.
[02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:51.970]  And what's more incredible is we struggle because it's the right thing to do and we keep our dignity.
[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:58.869]  But we're actually seeing the tide globally turn and real humanity and peace and real love come together.
[02:12:59.130 --> 02:13:02.409]  We're actually beginning to win the struggle right now.
[02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.430]  We had the initiative.
[02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:04.090]  We're getting chills.
[02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:07.489]  This is the time, as you keep saying, intensify, intensify.
[02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:08.789]  This is urgent.
[02:13:08.949 --> 02:13:10.210]  We just won a major battle.
[02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:13.029]  The enemy is striking back with a counteroffensive.
[02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:13.949]  Right.
[02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.710]  Of course.
[02:13:14.909 --> 02:13:17.029]  Of course the empire strikes back.
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:19.560]  But this is what we expect.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:25.399]  And we must be prepared politically, psychologically, economically.
[02:13:26.439 --> 02:13:29.340]  This is why we must pull together, pull together.
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:34.699]  And when I say long struggle, I'm not talking about just two or three days or two or three years.
[02:13:35.130 --> 02:13:35.609]  All right?
[02:13:35.789 --> 02:13:39.130]  I'm talking about any, you know, it could be 20 years.
[02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:40.989]  It could be 30 years.
[02:13:41.329 --> 02:13:47.489]  I remember when I, you know, began in the political struggle over 50 years ago.
[02:13:47.789 --> 02:13:49.470]  The struggle continues.
[02:13:49.770 --> 02:14:03.029]  But thank God, thank God that people like you, Alex, and others, and others, Joe Rogan, Musk, and most of all, Donald J. Trump.
[02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:04.470]  Thank goodness.
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.079]  That you folks said, you know what?
[02:14:08.239 --> 02:14:09.539]  We're in this struggle.
[02:14:09.699 --> 02:14:11.279]  And we love this country.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:14.579]  And we're going to make it great.
[02:14:14.779 --> 02:14:16.659]  And let's remember that, folks.
[02:14:16.979 --> 02:14:21.779]  They are doing everything that they can to sabotage.
[02:14:21.859 --> 02:14:28.539]  And I mean literally sabotage peace, sabotage an incoming administration.
[02:14:28.619 --> 02:14:33.520]  This is no peaceful transaction or transition, I should say.
[02:14:34.279 --> 02:14:36.579]  This is sabotage.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.140]  Let's remember that.
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.579]  Know who we're dealing with.
[02:14:39.899 --> 02:14:51.399]  And with Alex and his crew and all of those brothers and sisters fighting this, it's all about they are under attack through sabotage.
[02:14:51.609 --> 02:14:52.850]  Understand that.
[02:14:53.310 --> 02:15:00.649]  So again, I emphasize yet again that there's a need to understand the enemy.
[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:15.850]  And I use that word deliberately because they have made themselves the enemy of the people, not just of everyday, ordinary black, white, brown, red, and yellow people in this republic, but the enemy of people around the world,
[02:15:16.210 --> 02:15:20.770]  just everyday, ordinary folks like you, like me.
[02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:23.130]  Beautiful, brother.
[02:15:23.770 --> 02:15:27.550]  Before you leave us in six, seven minutes, please book a time to come on for a full hour.
[02:15:27.670 --> 02:15:32.789]  I would love to have you host an hour anytime you want, because I've read a lot of your writings.
[02:15:32.890 --> 02:15:33.550]  I've talked to you a lot.
[02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:34.729]  I've gone to dinner with you many times.
[02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:38.590]  You have a lot of historical knowledge and angles and real wisdom.
[02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:44.590]  I'm not going to second-guess Trump, but we've got two days in, no new statements on the escalation.
[02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:49.409]  Maybe he's got a piece still behind the signs, but I'm getting really concerned, and I know his family listens.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:50.899]  J.D. Vance listens.
[02:15:51.039 --> 02:15:51.680]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:52.720]  A lot.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:53.340]  We've met.
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:58.600]  What would you recommend or what would you say to the president about this critical time?
[02:15:58.779 --> 02:16:06.539]  Because I believe his main mandate, not just the border, not just the inflation, not just bringing us together, but was to stop World War III. I think that was the biggest thing.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:09.439]  What do you think the president should do?
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:30.479]  Well, with the utmost respect, and I do mean the utmost respect to President Donald J. Trump, I think it is imperative for him to, at bare minimum, let people know, one, how close we are to global nuclear,
[02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:33.760]  thermonuclear annihilation.
[02:16:33.959 --> 02:16:36.000]  I think you need to do that now.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:45.200]  And I think he needs to link it to what these bloodhounds are, the Democrats, let me just be blunt, are doing.
[02:16:45.379 --> 02:17:00.940]  That they are trying to not only sabotage an incoming administration, but they are literally holding a gun, metaphorical nuclear gun, to our heads, saying,
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:04.120]  you do it our way or we'll burn the house down.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:10.760]  Please, President Trump, please let the people know we're looking to you.
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:27.000]  Let them know what's happening, how close we are to nuclear annihilation, and let them know that they are simply trying to sabotage you, even before you get into the White House,
[02:17:27.159 --> 02:17:28.639]  to sabotage you.
[02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:36.469]  So I beg, I plead, I implore that President Trump will listen and J.D. Vance, please listen.
[02:17:37.049 --> 02:17:48.790]  I, again, extend my love, my respect to the entire Trump family and to you, J.D. Vance, and your family, of course.
[02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:51.610]  You're a major part of the Trump team.
[02:17:51.829 --> 02:18:00.219]  So I'm going to end it, I guess, by simply saying, please, President Trump, Don't let them put you in a hole.
[02:18:00.459 --> 02:18:02.239]  Put them in the hole.
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:05.879]  Let the people know what's really happening.
[02:18:06.079 --> 02:18:10.639]  Because it's not just about you as they try to make it appear.
[02:18:10.639 --> 02:18:11.920]  It's about us.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.719]  And you've said that many times.
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:15.459]  It's about everyday people.
[02:18:15.879 --> 02:18:23.579]  Let the people know not only how dangerous the situation that we are in, but let them know why we're in this situation.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:39.479]  And it's due to these bloodthirsty, hypocritical, nonsensical so-called Democrats who are the most undemocratic body I have seen in all my life in this country,
[02:18:39.719 --> 02:18:41.100]  in this republic.
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.600]  So let's keep on keeping on, President Trump.
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:46.219]  Keep on keeping on.
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:49.600]  The people need you to tell us.
[02:18:49.850 --> 02:18:52.649]  We want to hear it from you directly.
[02:18:53.010 --> 02:18:55.229]  And we love you, President Trump.
[02:18:56.010 --> 02:18:58.290]  Thank you so very, very much.
[02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:15.090]  And so happy to see, after many, many years, seeing a First Lady, who's a real First Lady, intelligent, I mean seriously intelligent, and got more class than a classroom.
[02:19:15.489 --> 02:19:18.090]  So glad to see you coming back, Melania.
[02:19:18.409 --> 02:19:19.629]  We love you too.
[02:19:20.069 --> 02:19:21.530]  All power to the people.
[02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:25.250]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow, through the hands of God.
[02:19:26.219 --> 02:19:28.280]  Larry, in closing, we've got 60 seconds left.
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:33.299]  That's actually in the Pentagon Doctrine to show how learned you are, because maybe one out of 10,000 people knows this.
[02:19:33.659 --> 02:19:37.780]  And I meant to say that before I even went on air, but you said it because you know as much as I do more.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:43.860]  You said we're in the first phase of World War III, and that's exactly how they describe it, how this would start with Russia.
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:48.139]  And if you look at those war games, we are almost out of the first phase now.
[02:19:49.039 --> 02:19:54.559]  And we are in World War III, and the Russians have already said this would be direct war if they did this.
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:56.479]  I'm expecting the announcement very soon.
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:58.239]  They could hit back any moment.
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:00.440]  I pray that Putin is restrained.
[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:05.680]  But would America take Russia launching missiles and blowing up military bases?
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:08.760]  I mean, this is just total madness.
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:10.479]  Larry Pickney, God bless you, brother.
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:11.879]  They're going to talk to you.
[02:20:11.959 --> 02:20:12.620]  Please come back on.
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:13.239]  I'm trying to get you on.
[02:20:13.319 --> 02:20:13.819]  You're hard to get on.
[02:20:13.899 --> 02:20:16.139]  So let me know as soon as you can get back on, brother.
[02:20:16.239 --> 02:20:16.540]  I love you.
[02:20:16.959 --> 02:20:17.319]  Love you.
[02:20:17.459 --> 02:20:18.219]  God bless, bro.
[02:20:18.819 --> 02:20:19.639]  All right, don't let him go.
[02:20:19.739 --> 02:20:19.940]  Get him.
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:20.600]  He's hard to get.
[02:20:21.399 --> 02:20:23.299]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[02:20:23.879 --> 02:20:24.819]  Naomi Wolf's coming up.
[02:20:25.059 --> 02:20:27.680]  This is just insane.
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:28.959]  Pray for peace, folks.
[02:20:29.079 --> 02:20:29.799]  This is so dangerous.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:30.840]  I can't even describe it to you.
[02:20:30.879 --> 02:20:31.819]  I think you already know that.
[02:20:33.139 --> 02:20:34.840]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[02:20:34.959 --> 02:20:37.979]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:20:38.139 --> 02:20:40.319]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.100]  You exercise your free speech.
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:44.020]  You stand up to the bullies.
[02:20:46.409 --> 02:20:48.370]  You exercise your will.
[02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:54.510]  And it keeps this broadcast, if we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:20:55.450 --> 02:20:58.870]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:59.889]  It's all set up.
[02:21:00.709 --> 02:21:03.110]  The crew, the studios, all of it.
[02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:09.110]  But we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[02:21:10.399 --> 02:21:14.520]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:22.879]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.639]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[02:21:28.399 --> 02:21:35.000]  You need to go to TheAlexShowStore.com Beautiful black shirt with an American Eagle and gold, says Trump won.
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.719]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.139]  People are going crazy over that.
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.979]  White with Trump won.
[02:21:40.739 --> 02:21:43.059]  Today is your Independence Day, 1-20.
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:44.680]  25.
[02:21:45.079 --> 02:21:46.819]  Yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day.
[02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:48.780]  When we keep them alive and it gets in there.
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:49.860]  That's great.
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:51.799]  So many new hats.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.260]  All of it made right there in Arkansas.
[02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:54.459]  So you get this stuff quick.
[02:21:54.579 --> 02:21:55.420]  It's already being made right now.
[02:21:56.079 --> 02:21:57.180]  A lot of new Trump searches.
[02:21:57.319 --> 02:21:58.239]  It'll take them weeks to get done.
[02:21:58.319 --> 02:21:59.040]  Not our sponsor.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:00.020]  They're ready right now.
[02:22:00.079 --> 02:22:02.739]  So your order's in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:06.059]  So many amazing designs, thealexjohnstore.com.
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:17.180]  And when you sign up at thealexjohnstore.com forward slash VIP or just click the VIP link at the top on the right hand side that's in red, when you do that, you get $40 each month to spend in the store for $30.
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:25.979]  So if you're going to buy the great supplements, going to get the great Patriot gear, going to support the broadcast, you've got to be VIP. It's month to month, $30, canceling time.
[02:22:26.299 --> 02:22:32.270]  So if you're going to be a supporter, everyone should be a VIP. We're about to go to Dr.
[02:22:32.409 --> 02:22:38.170]  Naomi Wolf, who is a true scholar and incredibly learned on history and world events.
[02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:41.549]  And I wanted to get her take on the World War III situation.
[02:22:41.629 --> 02:22:47.950]  We're already, by all the rules of war and the policies and doctrine of NATO and Russia, in a war.
[02:22:48.209 --> 02:22:50.370]  Russia has basically said a state of war exists.
[02:22:50.389 --> 02:23:00.350]  If the missiles were delivered, much less used, they would be at war with NATO. But we also have major updates on the poison shots, the 30 million dead by many estimates, 20 million at the lowest from the shots.
[02:23:00.350 --> 02:23:04.329]  And now they're bringing out a new disaster waiting to happen.
[02:23:04.510 --> 02:23:13.569]  FDA approves phase one trials of Gates funded self-amplifying spreading bird flu vaccine and some other huge developments there that she's about to break.
[02:23:13.690 --> 02:23:17.030]  But first off, I didn't see this.
[02:23:17.149 --> 02:23:17.989]  I see most things.
[02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:19.010]  I didn't think about it.
[02:23:19.939 --> 02:23:24.680]  When the Justice Department for the second time tried to hijack the building, they did it on May 31st.
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:28.379]  And then they did it again this time at a fake auction.
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:29.000]  They've been caught.
[02:23:29.479 --> 02:23:31.719]  And this time they cut the internet off so we couldn't broadcast.
[02:23:31.719 --> 02:23:32.700]  So I went to the backup studio.
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:35.420]  They knew I wouldn't leave until I had a court order.
[02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:37.760]  And the judges totally enraged at them.
[02:23:38.299 --> 02:23:40.879]  We filed all the documents, all the proof of the bid rigging, the fraud.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:41.700]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:43.159]  This is criminal in my view.
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:44.819]  And that's what our filing says.
[02:23:45.059 --> 02:23:46.000]  And we have the proof.
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:46.940]  Cut and dry.
[02:23:48.139 --> 02:23:50.200]  It devastated the Infowars store.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.340]  People thought, well, I'm not giving them money.
[02:23:54.259 --> 02:23:57.500]  Well, I'm not even really sure about that either, because we're going to win this.
[02:23:57.659 --> 02:23:59.680]  And, you know, they even kept that open.
[02:23:59.819 --> 02:24:07.159]  And the U.S. trustee that's in all this trouble called up to our crew Monday and said, well, why is the money down 70%?
[02:24:07.319 --> 02:24:09.379]  Now it's 80% of the sales.
[02:24:09.579 --> 02:24:17.299]  And they said, well, what do you think would happen when you said it belonged to the Onion and the gun control group that was funding them, the main Democrat gun control group?
[02:24:17.319 --> 02:24:18.399]  And what did you think was going to happen?
[02:24:19.690 --> 02:24:22.629]  And so people still are like, well, wait, do you own it or not?
[02:24:22.850 --> 02:24:23.569]  Yes, I do.
[02:24:23.729 --> 02:24:24.389]  Yes, they're in trouble.
[02:24:24.610 --> 02:24:25.809]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:24:26.149 --> 02:24:28.290]  The AlexJoanStore.com is not owned by me.
[02:24:28.850 --> 02:24:32.049]  It's our big sponsor with great supplements, Patriot t-shirts, all that stuff.
[02:24:32.209 --> 02:24:33.309]  That's our funding mechanism.
[02:24:33.629 --> 02:24:34.790]  These are great products.
[02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:37.850]  And now we're going to beat them and we're suing them.
[02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:39.049]  And I don't just put a good face on that.
[02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:41.629]  I mean, my lawyers are like, we're never 100% and it's 100%.
[02:24:41.629 --> 02:24:43.209]  I mean, we'll be surprised, you know...
[02:24:44.459 --> 02:24:46.059]  We'll be surprised if they're not indicted soon.
[02:24:46.239 --> 02:24:47.520]  I mean, this is wild.
[02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:48.239]  Okay?
[02:24:48.559 --> 02:24:50.059]  But regardless, we need funds.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:51.079]  Plus, these are great products.
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:52.500]  Go to thealexshowscore.com.
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.139]  Here is a one-minute breakdown.
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:55.079]  We'll go right to Dr.
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:55.559]  Naomi Wolf.
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.020]  Stay with us.
[02:24:56.729 --> 02:24:59.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is back on the air.
[02:24:59.209 --> 02:25:00.770]  The judge is having emergency hearings.
[02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:02.909]  Looks like their fraudulent sale won't go through.
[02:25:03.129 --> 02:25:10.370]  But regardless, I'm suing the daylights of the Democratic Party and the big national gun control group that's actually behind the onion and has now admitted it in court.
[02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:13.290]  So, we also have backup studios at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:20.389]  Whatever they do, we're staying on air to make sure Trump gets into office and to back him and his agenda to stop World War III, secure the borders and more.
[02:25:20.829 --> 02:25:22.270]  We can't do it without your support.
[02:25:22.430 --> 02:25:29.809]  So there are all these new, amazing, incredible designs up on thealexjonesstore.com that has nothing to do with InfoWars.
[02:25:30.090 --> 02:25:32.709]  Not owned by me, so they can never get that.
[02:25:32.850 --> 02:25:36.030]  That's how we stay on the air even if they're successful in shutting us down.
[02:25:36.209 --> 02:25:46.590]  If you go to thealexjonesstore.com and you get great supplements, t-shirts, limited edition collectible fundraiser, posters, and more, you will keep me on the air regardless of the Alex Jones Network.
[02:25:46.829 --> 02:25:51.270]  Please go to the site now, thealexjonesstore.com, and keep us on air.
[02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:52.450]  They're amazing products.
[02:25:52.629 --> 02:25:53.950]  Thank you so much for taking action.
[02:25:54.149 --> 02:25:55.030]  You are the resistance.
[02:25:56.329 --> 02:25:56.870]  All right, Dr.
[02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:59.930]  Wolf's reconnecting her Skype or Zoom, whatever we're on with her.
[02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:00.750]  She'll be back in a minute.
[02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:01.729]  I can't wait to talk to her.
[02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:05.930]  But again, the best design shirts yet have come out.
[02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:08.670]  And you know that famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel?
[02:26:08.969 --> 02:26:13.370]  My sister took like seven, eight years ago, and then people added more Alex Joneses, like clones coming out.
[02:26:13.899 --> 02:26:16.520]  That's kind of happened with Musk and Tucker and Rogan and everybody.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:17.879]  It's crazy.
[02:26:18.479 --> 02:26:20.520]  So it's, we're all Alex Jones shirt.
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:22.219]  My idea.
[02:26:22.379 --> 02:26:23.219]  I like it.
[02:26:23.299 --> 02:26:23.860]  People love it.
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.180]  That's a fundraiser.
[02:26:25.559 --> 02:26:26.659]  Thank you for your support.
[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:27.360]  I love you.
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:31.500]  It feels weird to sell t-shirts with my picture on it, but the enemy hates it.
[02:26:31.959 --> 02:26:35.719]  I've turned into a symbol of resistance and so it funds the operation.
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:44.069]  That and all the Trump one gear and a lot more at thealexjonesstore.com and again, We're under globalist attack.
[02:26:44.229 --> 02:26:45.270]  This is not a regular show.
[02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:46.450]  Some people don't seem to understand.
[02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:47.850]  They're like, why is he coming?
[02:26:47.969 --> 02:26:53.110]  Because I didn't, you know, Trump had like $15 billion when this all started.
[02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:54.309]  Now he's down to like $6 billion.
[02:26:55.170 --> 02:26:55.350]  Okay?
[02:26:56.569 --> 02:26:57.809]  Musk has hundreds of billions.
[02:26:58.149 --> 02:27:00.350]  He's lost $30-40 billion in the fight.
[02:27:00.989 --> 02:27:03.129]  I never had $10 million in the bank.
[02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:07.489]  I mean, a house and four bedrooms and a pool.
[02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:10.030]  And a little fishing shack.
[02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:12.670]  Okay, so I don't have all this money.
[02:27:12.829 --> 02:27:14.670]  So I hate begging.
[02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:19.129]  But what I really hate is giving in to the globalists and them winning.
[02:27:19.809 --> 02:27:21.930]  So thanks for your support.
[02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:24.030]  I humbly ask for your support now.
[02:27:24.129 --> 02:27:24.750]  Now is the time.
[02:27:24.889 --> 02:27:26.290]  30 years of work coming to a head.
[02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:27.610]  We've caught them with their pants down.
[02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:29.069]  It is incredible.
[02:27:29.629 --> 02:27:32.870]  An absolutely incredible time to be alive.
[02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.350]  All right.
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:35.340]  Dr.
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.120]  Naomi Wolf is our guest.
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:41.700]  She's got the new book out, the Pfizer Papers, announcement that RFK Jr.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:49.520]  has been nominated as the Head of Health and Human Services, has sent the stocks of Moderna and Pfizer plunging.
[02:27:50.170 --> 02:27:56.030]  The system is apoplectic, so they're trying to start World War III. There's been huge developments on that front.
[02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:57.889]  It's critical to keep exposing them.
[02:27:57.930 --> 02:28:05.629]  They'll ram through the UN Big Pharma Treaty over our bodies, and they even say they'll lock us up if we don't go to quarantine centers, even if we're not sick.
[02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:09.069]  They're going to try new poison injections, which they're already announcing.
[02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:10.850]  So this fight is ongoing.
[02:28:10.989 --> 02:28:11.590]  It isn't just about...
[02:28:13.559 --> 02:28:20.100]  We're good to go.
[02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:30.829]  So there's a lot to cover here.
[02:28:30.930 --> 02:28:31.950]  Disaster waiting to happen.
[02:28:32.129 --> 02:28:35.790]  FDA approves phase one trials of Gates funded self-amplifying bird flu vaccine.
[02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:36.549]  We'll get into that.
[02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:38.409]  So much more.
[02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:43.049]  Leftists drinking seed oils in rebellion against common sense.
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:51.969]  Senator Johnson demands HHS, FDA, CDC preserve all records relating to COVID-19 vaccines as Trump promises with Kennedy to release it.
[02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:53.729]  That's huge breaking news.
[02:28:53.829 --> 02:28:55.030]  I need listeners to help me.
[02:28:58.129 --> 02:29:09.260]  Because On Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, I was on cloud nine other than World War III. We have their ass.
[02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:25.500]  They thought if they memorialized the bid rigging and having fake rules for other real bidders and then rules for themselves, and then they gave it to the bid that lost, that was the highest bid,
[02:29:26.659 --> 02:29:27.819]  And now it's in our lawsuit.
[02:29:28.399 --> 02:29:30.159]  They fought memorializing it.
[02:29:30.459 --> 02:29:31.200]  I mean, here's the analogy.
[02:29:31.459 --> 02:29:41.479]  It'd be like, well, if I go kidnap that six-year-old out of their backyard and if I videotape it and then stream it on the internet, it's okay if I torture him to death because I videotape it.
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.940]  I mean, it's like, well, if I videotape myself robbing a bank, that'll make it okay because I'm telling everybody about it.
[02:29:49.270 --> 02:30:08.569]  So hijacking a building with no court order, fake sale, rig bids, I mean, it's spectacular, but it's emblematic of the desperation of the same group above them starting World War III. So it's insane.
[02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:11.430]  And I don't even know what to say at this point.
[02:30:11.829 --> 02:30:17.270]  But I was on cloud nine on that issue because we got their ass.
[02:30:18.930 --> 02:30:23.989]  And even other mainline analysts that are leftists, I meant to get these clips, they're like, oh my God, I read the documents.
[02:30:24.209 --> 02:30:25.850]  Jeez, Lord, this is devastating.
[02:30:25.989 --> 02:30:27.409]  This violates all these federal laws.
[02:30:29.829 --> 02:30:31.729]  And then I wasn't even looking at money.
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:36.520]  Because we barely had enough to operate and have the backup studios and all the stuff.
[02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:38.159]  It's had a lot of uplinks, but we were doing okay.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:39.579]  Had like a tenth of a tank.
[02:30:40.319 --> 02:30:44.319]  We're on E. And then I went to check money yesterday.
[02:30:44.799 --> 02:30:46.459]  I said, hey, I bet a bunch of extra money came in.
[02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:47.020]  Are we doing a little bit better?
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.440]  Can we give the crew a bonus for the first time in two years?
[02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:49.680]  And he goes, you don't want to know.
[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:53.540]  Everybody thinks that the shopping cart's owned by them.
[02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:58.079]  And we're down 70-something percent.
[02:30:58.620 --> 02:30:59.420]  Today it's 80.
[02:31:00.079 --> 02:31:03.059]  And then Blake, the guy that runs it, he goes, great guy.
[02:31:03.159 --> 02:31:03.659]  I've worked for 10 years.
[02:31:03.799 --> 02:31:09.739]  He goes, the U.S. trustee called yesterday and asked why no money's coming in.
[02:31:10.959 --> 02:31:13.399]  Because, you know, after we shut down, they would get that.
[02:31:14.739 --> 02:31:21.659]  And Blake's like, what do you think's going to happen when you say you own this?
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:22.700]  People aren't going to support it.
[02:31:24.799 --> 02:31:29.200]  So, see, People think that we're shut down.
[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.100]  They think they...
[02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:30.440]  No, no, no.
[02:31:30.559 --> 02:31:31.000]  So, hey, listen.
[02:31:31.139 --> 02:31:32.879]  M4Store.com, you'll get your stuff.
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:34.940]  Even if they shut it down by law, they gotta ship it down.
[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:36.120]  Ship it out.
[02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:37.120]  That's not gonna happen, probably.
[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:38.040]  99% chance.
[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:40.200]  I'm so sure, I'm actually nervous.
[02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:44.440]  But what I'm sure they can't get is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:46.120]  You got her on the phone yet?
[02:31:48.739 --> 02:31:49.239]  Okay, great.
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:50.840]  So, go to that.
[02:31:50.979 --> 02:31:51.379]  Sponsor that.
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:52.139]  Okay, Dr.
[02:31:52.319 --> 02:31:53.260]  Wolf on the phone.
[02:31:53.799 --> 02:31:57.100]  I hate the fact we can't see your beautiful face, but it's okay.
[02:31:57.899 --> 02:31:58.520]  Go with it.
[02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:01.500]  You've got big breaking news on so many fronts, the poison shots, all of it.
[02:32:01.559 --> 02:32:04.040]  But first, your take on the World War III situation.
[02:32:04.219 --> 02:32:04.920]  What do you make of it?
[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:06.200]  Sure.
[02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:13.000]  I have to say, I was saying before we got cut off, literally every time I talk to you, my electronics get applied.
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:17.600]  And I don't even know how that works, but it's all part of the larger picture you're describing.
[02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:24.180]  I just want to cast back for the audience Two years.
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:29.239]  Intermittently on Alex Jones' show, also on Steve Bannon.
[02:32:29.879 --> 02:32:34.379]  I would warn that, and Alex did too, obviously, because we see things similarly.
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:45.520]  I would warn about exactly this timeline, that the months leading right up to the election and then after that, the inauguration, would be extremely dangerous.
[02:32:46.110 --> 02:33:00.750]  And we predicted a number of things that have come true, ranging from cyber attacks to attacks on our food supply to catastrophic natural disasters without help coming, like in North Carolina.
[02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:02.950]  All of these are so predictable.
[02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:22.959]  But what is also sadly predictable, and I've said nuclear strike, nuclear strike so many times, or a dirty bomb, and I've pointed out that Really, we're in a time in which reality is constructed so much by the media and by AI in the media that if there is or isn't a nuclear strike,
[02:33:23.139 --> 02:33:34.520]  if there is or isn't a dirty bomb, we're really not going to be able to know, you know, till months later that AI can declare, stay in your home, there's been a nuclear strike, Philadelphia has been taken out.
[02:33:34.700 --> 02:34:05.139]  So my reaction to the insanity of sending U.S. It's a provocation by a desperate regime that has committed so many capital crimes that now they are clearly,
[02:34:05.379 --> 02:34:09.700]  you know, Deciding to kind of torch the building on their way out.
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:14.440]  Or as someone said to me recently, it's like a Hitler's bunker type of situation.
[02:34:15.139 --> 02:34:17.840]  Just provocation, catastrophe.
[02:34:18.479 --> 02:34:26.299]  My real worry, and you and I have talked about this and foretold it, my real worry is that, because this is so provocative, right?
[02:34:26.459 --> 02:34:27.920]  Provoking, provoking, provoking.
[02:34:28.079 --> 02:34:35.700]  Right now, all of the Western world depends on Putin's patience and forbearance, right?
[02:34:36.139 --> 02:34:47.159]  We're asking him to do the kinds of things we would never do if someone were sending missiles to hit Austin, Texas or San Francisco, California.
[02:34:47.459 --> 02:35:02.659]  So this is all, in my view, to provoke an attack from Putin, probably against us, or to be able to have a false flag In which we attack ourselves,
[02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:04.540]  essentially, like Pearl Harbor, right?
[02:35:04.700 --> 02:35:23.079]  We, you know, either create a nuclear attack or declare a nuclear attack or declare a missile attack on the American homeland, and that triggers a lot of other things that are, you know, that have happened in Ukraine, ironically, like then the regime can declare martial law,
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.530]  then they can release The National Guard and the military onto our soil.
[02:35:27.729 --> 02:35:36.090]  Then they can activate whoever these train de agua cartels are, you know, to take over whatever facilities they can be tasked with taking over.
[02:35:36.290 --> 02:35:39.530]  Then the quarantine camps can be utilized for the dissidents.
[02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:47.049]  You know, all of the domino effect of crisis, catastrophe, oh gosh, we can't have an inauguration.
[02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:50.489]  Oh, we have to take, you know, oh, who...
[02:35:50.819 --> 02:35:56.280]  You know, President Trump was in league with Putin when they unleashed this attack on our homeland.
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:57.440]  We have to take him prisoner.
[02:35:58.079 --> 02:36:01.159]  Or, oh, Iran's ally with Russia.
[02:36:01.159 --> 02:36:02.700]  They shot down Trump's airplane.
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:03.840]  They've been pre-programming that.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:04.159]  Yeah.
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:04.899]  Yeah.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:06.000]  No, exactly.
[02:36:06.399 --> 02:36:07.000]  Exactly.
[02:36:07.639 --> 02:36:15.620]  And I do think that Iran is being kind of drawn in and narrativized, as you say.
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:22.639]  But how would that relate to an attack on Buy U.S. and British missiles in Russia.
[02:36:23.639 --> 02:36:30.139]  That, oh, I get it, that then Russia tasked Iran with attacking back and taking down Putin's plane.
[02:36:30.239 --> 02:36:32.579]  But why would Iran take down Putin's plane?
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:34.700]  I'm sorry, Trump's plane in the narrative.
[02:36:35.729 --> 02:36:36.090]  Absolutely.
[02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:38.649]  So, President Trump is yet to make a statement.
[02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:43.110]  The one we've all seen is him a year ago predicting World War III and saying ceasefire, peace deal.
[02:36:43.350 --> 02:36:45.889]  I don't know why for 48 hours he's not been speaking.
[02:36:47.290 --> 02:36:48.670]  I've got some people I can call.
[02:36:48.809 --> 02:36:51.909]  I'll leave it at that to find out, but I keep expecting it.
[02:36:52.090 --> 02:36:54.110]  Do you have any ideas?
[02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:58.450]  Because you're one of the most accurate people that kind of portending what's happening.
[02:36:58.790 --> 02:37:02.709]  A, and then B, what would you think Trump should say when he does make a statement?
[02:37:03.540 --> 02:37:04.739]  Oh, my God, it's so difficult.
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:06.379]  Well, thank you.
[02:37:06.559 --> 02:37:10.159]  Now, you're saying Trump hasn't issued a statement for 48 hours?
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:10.860]  Is that what you said?
[02:37:11.059 --> 02:37:17.739]  Yeah, that statement everybody saw that's gone mega-viral is from him a year ago, where he said we need to have a ceasefire on this to lead to nuclear war.
[02:37:17.819 --> 02:37:18.700]  He's not made a statement.
[02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:19.559]  Don Jr.
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:27.700]  did, saying the military-industrial complex is trying to derail him before he takes office by starting World War III. Right.
[02:37:28.579 --> 02:37:33.420]  But no, I mean, this clip is older.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:35.299]  We're still waiting for a new statement.
[02:37:35.739 --> 02:37:36.280]  Right.
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.280]  Okay, here's my bet.
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:41.079]  You can call me out if I'm wrong.
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:53.700]  But my guess is that Trump has been quiet for the last 48 hours either because he's on the phone all the time with Putin or because he's flying to Russia to broker a peace deal.
[02:37:55.879 --> 02:37:57.200]  Well, I hope that's the case.
[02:37:57.399 --> 02:38:00.299]  Yeah, that would be a Trump move, wouldn't it?
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:02.139]  I think so.
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:03.600]  I mean, one of those two.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:05.399]  Or flying to Kiev, right?
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:13.600]  I mean, how interesting that the embassy in Kiev was closed down in an abundance of caution.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:17.680]  It would be so interesting.
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:19.819]  I mean, you know, honestly, it's like...
[02:38:20.399 --> 02:38:24.399]  He bringsmanship and statesmanship at the highest possible level, almost suicidal.
[02:38:24.659 --> 02:38:30.500]  But I don't think you can stop private people from flying in and out of Ukraine.
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.159]  I don't think you can stop private people from flying in and out of Russia.
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.340]  He's not on any list that would prevent him from flying in and out of either of those countries.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:47.500]  How fascinating it would be if he kind of nipped in under the radar, got the stakeholders together in a room and broke it in peace.
[02:38:48.329 --> 02:38:48.729]  Absolutely.
[02:38:48.969 --> 02:38:50.750]  People saying, Logan, I don't know what they're talking about.
[02:38:50.889 --> 02:39:08.309]  A president-elect, president-elects all the time start detente and start their new policies, and it would be completely lawful and the smart thing to do and the same thing to do for him to get involved because, I mean, look, John Kerry ran around when Trump was in office doing the opposite with his shadow diplomacy.
[02:39:09.709 --> 02:39:10.629]  What do you mean by that?
[02:39:11.250 --> 02:39:17.690]  Well, I mean, Kerry and Obama still ran around doing their policy, trying to change policy when Trump was president.
[02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:22.329]  Well, Trump's actually the new president-elect.
[02:39:22.549 --> 02:39:26.670]  He has the mandate, and so there's no reason he can't legally do that.
[02:39:27.629 --> 02:39:28.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:31.590]  I also am surprised.
[02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:34.770]  That there isn't more of a move.
[02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:37.209]  I mean, the Republicans are so disappointing, right?
[02:39:37.409 --> 02:39:41.450]  But this is such an Article 25 move, right?
[02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:57.010]  I mean, I wrote an essay a few weeks ago about how, you know, telling liberals that they really should vote for Trump because Vice President Harris has one job, and that's to let us know if the president is incapacitated or dead.
[02:39:57.250 --> 02:40:00.989]  And he didn't do that, right, knowing that he was demented for...
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:02.840]  Probably two years or more.
[02:40:03.479 --> 02:40:07.620]  So this could also be, like, who did this, right?
[02:40:07.639 --> 02:40:08.799]  Who's in charge of the White House?
[02:40:08.959 --> 02:40:12.700]  Who issued the okay for these strikes?
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:14.620]  Who cleared this foreign policy?
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:18.600]  President Biden was in Peru, in the rainforest.
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:24.760]  Maybe he issued the instructions from there, but he's not in his right mind.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:32.409]  So there's a real kind of constitutional question, Alex, of who's Who's declared war?
[02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:34.030]  And it is a declaration of war, right?
[02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:39.770]  Without Congress, which is unconstitutional, and without a sitting president who's in his right mind.
[02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:47.329]  So I know there have been impeachment proceedings brought against him for having done something wrong.
[02:40:49.859 --> 02:40:56.260]  And by the way, as you know, General Flynn, Congressman Massey, Senator Howley have all said what you just said.
[02:40:56.479 --> 02:41:02.940]  And my listeners got really mad at me yesterday when I said they need to either have Article 25 or immediate snap impeachment.
[02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:04.600]  He's clearly violated the War Powers Act.
[02:41:04.739 --> 02:41:08.680]  He's declared war on the number one nuclear superpower insanely.
[02:41:09.540 --> 02:41:10.659]  Whoever's really in control.
[02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:18.569]  And we need to have emergency hearings, hauling in the head of the State Department, Blinken, hauling in the CIA director, and saying, we know you're really behind this, you lunatics.
[02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:19.489]  Stop it right now.
[02:41:19.489 --> 02:41:21.850]  You don't have the mandate to do this.
[02:41:21.989 --> 02:41:22.909]  You're leaving office.
[02:41:23.409 --> 02:41:25.370]  And people said, oh, you want Kamala in.
[02:41:25.450 --> 02:41:27.309]  No, if she does it, we impeach her too.
[02:41:27.569 --> 02:41:29.889]  We let them know we're not putting up with this.
[02:41:29.969 --> 02:41:32.129]  So this is not me trying to get Kamala Harris in.
[02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:33.590]  Right.
[02:41:33.709 --> 02:41:35.829]  I really want to second what you just said.
[02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:38.149]  It's so lonely, Alex.
[02:41:38.370 --> 02:41:45.090]  Like, you and I and maybe six other people know how the Constitution is supposed to work in a crisis like this.
[02:41:45.090 --> 02:41:47.690]  I'm not kind of blowing our own corns.
[02:41:47.729 --> 02:41:52.510]  I'm just wishing everyone remembered from civics class or that they were given a refresher course.
[02:41:52.649 --> 02:41:54.129]  It's not up to us, right?
[02:41:54.430 --> 02:41:58.270]  If the president is incapacitated, he gets Article 25.
[02:41:58.549 --> 02:42:05.549]  If he goes to war without the buy-in of Congress or the authorization of Congress, that's unconstitutional.
[02:42:05.829 --> 02:42:07.770]  He needs to be, I mean, what?
[02:42:08.069 --> 02:42:08.870]  Like detained?
[02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:10.229]  Arrested?
[02:42:10.409 --> 02:42:27.680]  I mean, this is a scene right out of, what was that 1960s film in which a crazy president issued sort of nuclear attacks Without, you know, without being tethered to reality anymore.
[02:42:28.159 --> 02:42:29.500]  That has to happen.
[02:42:29.719 --> 02:42:33.079]  And if she's vice president, okay, she's vice president.
[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:41.079]  And she gets impeached or she gets arrested for treason, right, for concealing the impairment of the president.
[02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:48.250]  And then we need to find out who gave these orders, because if Tony Blinken did, well, that's illegal, right?
[02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:58.000]  Whoever gave the orders to the United States to go to war without the authorization of the people, this is a—I mean, people are really underplaying what a— Massive.
[02:42:58.059 --> 02:42:59.440]  Well, this is the ultimate coup.
[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:00.860]  I mean, this is what you do.
[02:43:01.379 --> 02:43:02.799]  This is what you do to stay in power.
[02:43:02.959 --> 02:43:03.520]  I've been saying it.
[02:43:03.579 --> 02:43:14.500]  You've been saying it over and over again in the last few months that obviously they would make this move if they weren't going to go quietly once he was president-elect, and they've done it.
[02:43:15.159 --> 02:43:15.520]  Right.
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:33.360]  But I guess what you're kind of illuminating, which hadn't really become clear to me until this conversation, is that the chaos isn't just We're good to go.
[02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:43.340]  We're good to go.
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:03.139]  I mean, literally, we're all sitting around waiting to see how mad Putin's going to get to see if we wake up tomorrow and if our kids wake up tomorrow.
[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:04.700]  I mean, this is madness.
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:05.959]  It's beyond madness.
[02:44:06.159 --> 02:44:08.200]  It's global-scale madness.
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:13.420]  And the only people who are tasked with stopping it are, ironically, Vice President Harris.
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:14.260]  He's not acting.
[02:44:14.459 --> 02:44:16.700]  But then members of Congress, right?
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:20.459]  Aren't they supposed to step in and impeach in Article 25?
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:23.040]  I mean, these are emergency...
[02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:28.250]  Thank you.
[02:44:36.879 --> 02:44:37.239]  Absolutely.
[02:44:37.239 --> 02:44:38.659]  We got you on a little late.
[02:44:38.780 --> 02:44:41.239]  I want you to get into the big poison shot news.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:42.360]  I don't call it a vaccine.
[02:44:42.559 --> 02:44:44.020]  The experimental injection news.
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:47.280]  And coming out what Robert F. Kennedy said a few months ago.
[02:44:47.379 --> 02:44:51.620]  He said, when we get in, we know they've got all their own secret studies and reports.
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:53.219]  Really, they're range-finding.
[02:44:53.219 --> 02:44:54.280]  They know exactly what they were doing.
[02:44:54.479 --> 02:44:56.840]  That's how the FDA on October...
[02:44:57.889 --> 02:45:05.989]  The 28th of 2020 was able to predict the, quote, adverse reactions.
[02:45:05.989 --> 02:45:10.930]  I want to go to break, and I want to come back and have you at least do 15 minutes, Dr.
[02:45:11.049 --> 02:45:13.489]  Wolf, if you can, if you've got to leave, I understand, on that.
[02:45:13.489 --> 02:45:26.790]  But just in the 60 seconds left, though, putting bookends on this, what does the public need to do to stop the escalation of World War III? Well, first, stay calm, as we always say.
[02:45:29.119 --> 02:45:30.559]  That's a tough one, right?
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:34.340]  Because it's really in the hands of people far above our pay grade.
[02:45:34.739 --> 02:45:38.159]  I guess lobby the Republicans to move in quickly.
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:44.159]  I mean, they have a majority now across the board to move in quickly to impeachment Article 25.
[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:48.680]  And if, I mean, I'm looking up presidential disability and succession.
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:49.059]  Yeah.
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:59.840]  The Speaker of the House He has to get a written declaration that he's unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:08.579]  And then the Senate and Speaker of the House have to move in when the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:14.739]  The Vice President immediately assumes the powers and duties and is acting president, and she gets impeached.
[02:46:15.639 --> 02:46:16.040]  Dr.
[02:46:16.159 --> 02:46:16.659]  Wolf, stay there.
[02:46:16.799 --> 02:46:17.719]  Back in two minutes.
[02:46:17.819 --> 02:46:18.299]  Please stay with us.
[02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:23.129]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[02:46:23.409 --> 02:46:35.670]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:37.489]  They are a private agency.
[02:46:37.729 --> 02:46:42.010]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[02:46:42.270 --> 02:46:44.770]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[02:46:45.090 --> 02:46:45.569]  No.
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:52.299]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:53.000]  No.
[02:46:53.239 --> 02:47:06.209]  Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:47:06.409 --> 02:47:13.489]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[02:47:13.709 --> 02:47:18.149]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration.
[02:47:23.149 --> 02:47:27.629]  It's where the ESGs come from.
[02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:29.690]  It's where the global governance comes from.
[02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:32.229]  The corporate social credit scores, all of it.
[02:47:32.350 --> 02:47:34.950]  And President Trump is striking right at the end.
[02:47:34.969 --> 02:47:37.729]  At the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:45.090]  Now, in closing here, InfoWars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[02:47:45.250 --> 02:47:47.950]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[02:47:48.290 --> 02:47:52.750]  But regardless, backups are being set up, new systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[02:47:52.989 --> 02:48:02.090]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:09.040]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[02:48:09.299 --> 02:48:19.579]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:20.719]  Here it is on screen.
[02:48:21.319 --> 02:48:21.879]  Iconic.
[02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:32.399]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:44.149]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:53.930]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with three simple words at the bottom.
[02:48:54.129 --> 02:48:56.010]  Back to back to back.
[02:48:56.569 --> 02:48:56.989]  That's right.
[02:48:57.090 --> 02:49:04.850]  He's the only president to ever run three times, and he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:09.389]  He won in 16, he won in 2020, and he won in 2024.
[02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:13.069]  But this time the landslide was so big, they could not stop him.
[02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:14.969]  This is historic.
[02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.850]  We've won the battle.
[02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:19.190]  Now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[02:49:19.329 --> 02:49:25.479]  And to do that, he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:30.780]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:35.559]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:49.200]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get the Trump Patriot apparel, get the posters, there's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[02:49:49.459 --> 02:49:52.079]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:53.299]  Thanks for your support.
[02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:54.780]  God bless and good luck.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[02:49:59.239 --> 02:49:59.920]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:18.670 --> 02:50:19.790]  All right, we're finishing up with Dr.
[02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:22.450]  Naomi Wolf here in this little short segment, a little bit in the next segment.
[02:50:22.930 --> 02:50:26.569]  Some stations don't care this first five, but we'll join them in about six minutes.
[02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:33.409]  Look, I don't claim to be a rocket scientist or have all the answers, but this is all I do.
[02:50:33.409 --> 02:50:34.430]  So I study quite a bit.
[02:50:34.569 --> 02:50:35.170]  It's fascinating.
[02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:35.969]  So I'm into this.
[02:50:36.209 --> 02:50:37.409]  I have a passion for it.
[02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:39.530]  And again, listeners got really mad at me.
[02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:40.129]  Well, that's fine.
[02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:45.270]  I'm not here to win this.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:47.979]  Popularity contest.
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:51.420]  I warn they want to install Harris and pull some stuff.
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:53.059]  I know that, and they tried it.
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:54.700]  We told you that first, me and Roger Stone.
[02:50:56.180 --> 02:50:57.559]  This has nothing to do with that now.
[02:50:57.940 --> 02:51:00.760]  He is insane, or whoever's running him, he's a puppet.
[02:51:01.939 --> 02:51:03.680]  And 25th Amendment or impeachment.
[02:51:04.059 --> 02:51:07.979]  And then we tell Harris, you start a war, we'll impeach your ass in the next 62 days.
[02:51:08.559 --> 02:51:10.040]  So it's the Constitution.
[02:51:10.639 --> 02:51:14.639]  And if you're not going to follow that, well then just throw it out like everything else that's being thrown out.
[02:51:15.299 --> 02:51:18.639]  So it's not, I saw Internet Jones, he works for them.
[02:51:18.719 --> 02:51:22.079]  He's trying to get the, he's trying to get Harris in.
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:23.620]  And General Flynn's bad too.
[02:51:23.819 --> 02:51:31.729]  And Senator Howley and Congressman All these congressmen coming out, Massey, super respected.
[02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:33.709]  I mean, no, it's what you do.
[02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:41.170]  And then, of course, we bring out who really gave the orders, and as soon as Trump gets in, we indict their ass.
[02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:45.870]  Okay, so Naomi, well, this is a short segment, a little bit longer coming up, and we'll let you get out of here.
[02:51:46.049 --> 02:51:47.909]  But I want to get into the next segment, the...
[02:51:50.489 --> 02:51:53.370]  The government cover-up of the poison shots and how huge this is.
[02:51:53.450 --> 02:51:54.709]  This is all getting ready to come out.
[02:51:54.850 --> 02:51:56.049]  That's why they want World War III to stop it.
[02:51:56.049 --> 02:51:58.809]  But in the few minutes we have left here, we're finishing up on the succession.
[02:51:59.409 --> 02:52:04.430]  And to the listeners that are mad at me, which is fine, then what do we do?
[02:52:04.430 --> 02:52:07.229]  We just leave Biden in there and then he does that?
[02:52:07.329 --> 02:52:08.690]  And then we don't do our duty?
[02:52:09.209 --> 02:52:10.950]  Because justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:52:11.049 --> 02:52:15.770]  We've gotten in this position by saying, oh, well, she'll be worse, so let's not, no, we'll get rid of her too.
[02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:18.110]  Can you try to explain that to people that are mad at me?
[02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:21.360]  Okay.
[02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:32.159]  Well, I read Article 25 carefully during the break, and you're 100% right, but I'm glad to tell everybody when you said, what should people do?
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:49.159]  They have a lot of power because the way I read Article 25, in the immediate emergency, the vice president becomes president, but then Congress is supposed to convene, and within a very limited period of time, Congress is supposed to decide what it wants to do next.
[02:52:49.430 --> 02:52:55.250]  So Congress is in charge when the president is impaired, vice president or no vice president.
[02:52:55.409 --> 02:52:57.129]  That's what Article 25 says.
[02:52:57.309 --> 02:53:09.110]  So Congress can convene right now and decide to, I mean, I hate to see this because it's such a disruption of our traditions, but they can decide to inaugurate President Trump early.
[02:53:09.389 --> 02:53:12.510]  I don't read Article 25 as saying anything against that.
[02:53:12.690 --> 02:53:17.729]  It really says they're in charge of what to do next if there's an emergency like an impaired president.
[02:53:17.889 --> 02:53:20.870]  And they can also decide to stop the war, right?
[02:53:20.989 --> 02:53:28.850]  They can decide to send emissaries to convene a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.
[02:53:29.569 --> 02:53:34.149]  Article 25 really does say it goes back to Congress when the president is impaired.
[02:53:34.569 --> 02:53:38.690]  The vice president is there kind of as a figurehead until Congress decides what it wants to do.
[02:53:39.909 --> 02:53:40.350]  Absolutely.
[02:53:40.729 --> 02:53:53.850]  And of course, if Biden's removed for starting World War III or trying to completely start it, definitely we're in the first phase of it, then that's going to let the shadow government know they're on a very short leash.
[02:53:54.250 --> 02:53:55.969]  Or we just say, okay, that's fine.
[02:53:56.090 --> 02:54:00.770]  And I'm also concerned most of his appointments or people he's nominated are good.
[02:54:01.709 --> 02:54:04.590]  Some of the folks he's bringing in have been neocons in the past.
[02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:06.909]  The question is, will they be warmongers now?
[02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:11.590]  So I'm And Trump did not have the best actual real Ukraine policy.
[02:54:11.729 --> 02:54:16.690]  He had good rhetoric, and the Russians seem open to it, but he did increase sanctions.
[02:54:16.809 --> 02:54:17.610]  He did increase weapons.
[02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:19.450]  This baby needs to be put to bed.
[02:54:19.569 --> 02:54:20.389]  This war needs to stop.
[02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:28.170]  I mean, I'm not a foreign policy expert, but I guess what I don't see is diplomacy, right?
[02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:31.950]  I don't see any kind of active diplomacy trying to get...
[02:54:32.219 --> 02:54:49.049]  The warring parties to sit down at a table and protect lives rather than just Launder more money, launder more money, send taxpayer money, build up more missiles, pump up the war machine and the profits of Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
[02:54:49.229 --> 02:54:51.510]  I mean, that's what I'm not seeing.
[02:54:51.850 --> 02:54:52.309]  You're right, Dr.
[02:54:52.430 --> 02:54:52.530]  Wolf.
[02:54:52.729 --> 02:54:56.930]  And again, the Pentagon confirms, the White House confirms, they haven't talked to the Russians in years.
[02:54:57.149 --> 02:54:58.989]  The hotline's not been used in over two and a half years.
[02:54:59.090 --> 02:54:59.610]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:59.809 --> 02:55:00.489]  Stay with us.
[02:55:00.569 --> 02:55:02.569]  We'll get into the poison shot news that is the biggest ever.
[02:55:02.879 --> 02:55:25.590]  Alright, we have got massive news on the whole global poison shot UN treaty We're good to go.
[02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:37.090]  Just the stuff we've gotten has been devastating.
[02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:44.090]  And we got the New Zealand files, some other European files that correlate by death and by who had the shots, and it's the people taking the shots.
[02:55:44.649 --> 02:55:48.709]  So that goes with the insurance numbers that show it is tens of millions dead from it.
[02:55:48.909 --> 02:55:49.350]  So Dr.
[02:55:49.510 --> 02:55:51.829]  Wolf, we'll have you back again when we've got a better connection.
[02:55:51.829 --> 02:55:55.270]  By the way, she wasn't just paranoid, but she said when she comes on the show she gets hacked.
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:55:57.559]  Her Skype gets cut out.
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:59.040]  Her computer shuts down repeatedly.
[02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:03.340]  When she did a huge show a few months ago, somebody hacked her ex and took it over.
[02:56:04.159 --> 02:56:06.760]  We got hacked three days ago.
[02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:07.979]  I haven't announced this yet.
[02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:11.219]  But no, we're up against the CIA here, folks.
[02:56:11.319 --> 02:56:12.280]  This is real.
[02:56:12.799 --> 02:56:13.440]  So, Dr.
[02:56:13.500 --> 02:56:14.899]  Wolf, they really don't want you to speak.
[02:56:14.979 --> 02:56:21.079]  They're so scared of your work as your best-selling author, former high-level Democrat strategist who's exposing her whole system.
[02:56:21.159 --> 02:56:23.540]  Let's get into the A snapshot of this big news.
[02:56:23.639 --> 02:56:26.379]  And then as soon as you can, we'll have you back up to go into this in detail.
[02:56:26.500 --> 02:56:27.760]  But tell us what's happening here.
[02:56:28.559 --> 02:56:28.979]  Thank you.
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:30.360]  It is huge news.
[02:56:30.559 --> 02:56:47.149]  I mean, for almost two and a half years now, my team, the 3,250 doctors and scientists who were convened under war rooms and daily class ages to read through the Pfizer documents, The 450,000 documents released under court order,
[02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:52.209]  and they broke the story of the greatest crimes against humanity in recorded history.
[02:56:52.450 --> 02:56:58.110]  People have been asking me for all these years, when will there be hearings in Congress?
[02:56:58.270 --> 02:56:59.909]  When will there be the start of justice?
[02:57:00.170 --> 02:57:03.290]  And so that has officially begun as of yesterday.
[02:57:04.010 --> 02:57:07.450]  Senator Ron Johnson just issued a letter.
[02:57:07.649 --> 02:57:08.909]  It's posted on Daily Cloud.
[02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:12.090]  I pinned it on my X. It's a beautiful letter.
[02:57:12.430 --> 02:57:30.549]  I'm basically demanding the unredactions of One of our lawyers, Ed Berkovich, obtained them under FOIA. He demanded myocarditis-related documents from the CDC. And I think there was a whistleblower who responded,
[02:57:30.750 --> 02:57:35.770]  a secret leaker, because we got the most damning tranche emails you can imagine.
[02:57:35.770 --> 02:57:39.069]  And they're right there linked to Senator Johnson's letter.
[02:57:39.250 --> 02:57:44.229]  And what they show is they freak out in April of 2021 at the highest level.
[02:57:44.639 --> 02:57:45.500]  Dr.
[02:57:45.659 --> 02:57:46.420]  Fauci, Dr.
[02:57:46.559 --> 02:57:49.819]  Walensky, 15 White House staffers, right?
[02:57:49.979 --> 02:57:54.379]  There's a template that could surface the communication to POTUS, right?
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:58:09.860]  The most senior people, HHS. And they were freaking out not because they'd been informed by the Israeli Ministry of Health that the vaccines, the COVID vaccines, were damaging the hearts of minors, They weren't freaking out, oh my gosh,
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:14.280]  we have to tell the American public about this right away so we don't endanger any more kids.
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:20.319]  No, what those rejected emails show is they were freaking out about how to cover it up.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:27.200]  And what they concluded was they created a 17-page script, which is, again, linked in Senator Johnson's letter.
[02:58:27.379 --> 02:58:32.860]  You can see it pinned on my Substack or on Daily Cloud, and it is completely redacted.
[02:58:32.959 --> 02:58:44.090]  But from that script, they assured us falsely for the rest of the time to this Present day that myocarditis is transient and rare and mild, which is a lie.
[02:58:44.350 --> 02:58:47.549]  And as you know, kids are dropping dead on the football field.
[02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:48.850]  They're dying in their sleep.
[02:58:49.209 --> 02:58:50.430]  Athletes are dropping dead.
[02:58:50.629 --> 02:58:53.110]  They knew what would happen and they tried to cover it up.
[02:58:53.370 --> 02:59:01.030]  And Senator Johnson, to his credit, has moved ahead assertively to unredact those emails and see what they're trying to hide.
[02:59:03.059 --> 02:59:05.600]  And that's why the entire power structure is so scared.
[02:59:05.620 --> 02:59:08.760]  I am so proud of Elon Musk and RFK Jr.
[02:59:09.159 --> 02:59:11.819]  As soon as Trump won...
[02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:16.379]  Within a day of the election, Musk went on a full attack on Fauci.
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:17.959]  A full attack.
[02:59:18.159 --> 02:59:22.020]  I mean, we're talking billions of people reading and watching the videos he was putting out.
[02:59:22.079 --> 02:59:22.799]  He's still doing it.
[02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:26.120]  Going right to the heart of the matter, right after the death cult.
[02:59:26.559 --> 02:59:28.079]  I mean, this is real.
[02:59:28.239 --> 02:59:28.940]  This is bold.
[02:59:29.120 --> 02:59:29.899]  Musk is for real.
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:30.719]  Trump's for real.
[02:59:30.899 --> 02:59:31.620]  Kennedy's for real.
[02:59:31.819 --> 02:59:37.440]  They are causing, we are, the listeners, irrevocable damage to the globalists.
[02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:42.319]  That's why it makes sense for them to hold a nuclear war gun to our head.
[02:59:42.530 --> 02:59:46.750]  Just like when a bank robber gets caught and the cops come in and he grabs the teller and puts a gun to their head.
[02:59:46.930 --> 02:59:48.270]  That's where we are right now.
[02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:49.950]  You're absolutely right.
[02:59:50.090 --> 02:59:51.290]  We're all being held hostage.
[02:59:51.770 --> 02:59:54.850]  The United States is being held hostage, for sure.
[02:59:55.969 --> 03:00:12.239]  Or, you know, the other possibility is that, as we said earlier in our conversation, the strike or the, you know, evil allies strike acting in alliance with our bad guys here in the United States is I mean,
[03:00:12.319 --> 03:00:18.600]  this crime is so big, Alex, every facet of it, and it's definitely related to the news coming out of Mar-a-Lago.
[03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:25.860]  I mean, RFPG, I kind of wish, personally, they wouldn't show their hands so much, but maybe they've got a strategy I'm unaware of.
[03:00:26.059 --> 03:00:38.600]  But, you know, absolutely, if anyone knows How to find the crimes, what the emails mean, what the recourse should be, what the law calls for, who should get arrested first.
[03:00:38.940 --> 03:00:40.079]  It's RSK Jr.
[03:00:40.319 --> 03:00:43.020]  And he's showing that he's not going to hold back, right?
[03:00:43.219 --> 03:00:46.059]  And Trump seems to be fully behind him.
[03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:54.530]  So, you know, that's just one tranche of crime that we're talking about, HHS. CDC, FDA, but there are, you know, economic crimes.
[03:00:54.530 --> 03:00:56.530]  There are lockdown crimes.
[03:00:56.709 --> 03:01:01.409]  There are where did a trillion dollars go heading into Ukraine crimes.
[03:01:01.610 --> 03:01:07.840]  I mean, you could probably add a list of Absolutely.
[03:01:08.420 --> 03:01:19.620]  The poison shot thing takes down the globalists, takes down the WEF, takes down Big Pharma, takes down the Gates Crime Syndicate, the human smuggling of children, many of them for slave labor and sex slavery.
[03:01:19.860 --> 03:01:21.020]  That will bring them down.
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:27.340]  I mean, these are all windows to not just do the right thing, but bring down the entire globalist system.
[03:01:27.459 --> 03:01:34.479]  That's why we've got to be engaged, and we've got to let the warmongers know, and we've got to let the Speaker of the House know who's been for this.
[03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:46.590]  Thank you.
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:56.440]  All right, I said I'd go to calls.
[03:01:56.780 --> 03:02:00.639]  I need to get to this man and Steve Bannon information and more breaking news after that.
[03:02:00.799 --> 03:02:03.700]  But let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[03:02:03.879 --> 03:02:05.459]  Carlos has been calling in for decades.
[03:02:05.899 --> 03:02:07.280]  He's been a guest, actually.
[03:02:07.420 --> 03:02:08.479]  Very smart guy.
[03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:11.579]  I'm not going to get into his whole background, but he knows what he's talking about.
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:13.899]  Carlos, give us a quick snapshot of what you make of the situation.
[03:02:14.899 --> 03:02:15.739]  Thank you very much.
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:18.520]  Just a quick word first about Infowars.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:35.500]  One of the greatest contributions, Alex, that you have made with Infowars, We're good to go.
[03:02:46.709 --> 03:03:10.069]  That the real power behind all of this, the master builder of all this control, one world government ideology, is really began in 1773, and it was an organizing of the Let's say financial groups that decided that these groups were going to bring about one world government.
[03:03:10.329 --> 03:03:16.290]  Because as bankers, they would be able to control how they lent the money and how they got paid back.
[03:03:16.569 --> 03:03:23.670]  Essentially a naive idea at first, but the mechanisms were then developed and put in place, and this is what we're facing today.
[03:03:24.010 --> 03:03:39.600]  There are two quotes, therefore, that I use as a reference, including, as we will talk about Ukraine today, one quote is, Let us issue and control a nation's currency, and I care not who makes its laws.
[03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:40.600]  That's Lord Rothschild.
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:41.819]  He put it on the top of his bank.
[03:03:42.940 --> 03:03:44.079]  1791, that's correct.
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:47.500]  The other one, you will know, and you'll finish the quote for me.
[03:03:47.659 --> 03:03:53.659]  He says, we will have a world government, whether you like it or not.
[03:03:53.920 --> 03:04:00.079]  The only question is whether that government will be achieved by conquest or consent.
[03:04:00.319 --> 03:04:02.079]  And that was James Paul Wahlberg.
[03:04:02.459 --> 03:04:07.200]  February 17, 1950, a banker, as he testified before the U.S. Senate.
[03:04:07.459 --> 03:04:26.670]  When you put those two quotes ahead of all thinking and the review of Infowars, First of all, who is the motivating factor behind all of the control of the government and the global one world government?
[03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:28.270]  Because these are globalists.
[03:04:28.510 --> 03:04:31.610]  Some of them call them neocons because of the war aspect.
[03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:34.389]  But in my opinion, these are neo-Bolsheviks.
[03:04:34.629 --> 03:04:42.979]  These are people who are Again, involved in world revolution for control and their communistic lines and- Well, that's right.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.920]  I mean, the neocons are Trotskyites.
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:46.379]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:47.040]  That's a fact.
[03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:48.000]  I mean, it's not debated, folks.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:48.319]  That's correct.
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:49.639]  Neobolsheviks.
[03:04:49.879 --> 03:04:58.579]  Now, with concerns to Ukraine, there was a recent meeting between incoming President Trump and President Biden.
[03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:07.159]  And in that meeting, the issue of weapons being given to Ukraine, because NATO has been in Ukraine now.
[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:09.780]  We know that before 2022.
[03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:11.579]  They've been in Ukraine.
[03:05:11.899 --> 03:05:13.100]  We're almost out of time.
[03:05:13.219 --> 03:05:14.239]  Get to your point on nuclear war.
[03:05:14.780 --> 03:05:16.239]  But the point is that...
[03:05:17.350 --> 03:05:34.110]  I think?
[03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:50.969]  And really make a point about the validity of the decision made by President Biden to be brought back to, yes, they can have these rockets, but no, they may not use them for offense.
[03:05:50.969 --> 03:05:52.530]  They can only use them for defense.
[03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:56.030]  And defense is only within the territory of Ukraine.
[03:05:57.930 --> 03:05:58.829]  Well said.
[03:05:59.909 --> 03:06:05.889]  Do you agree with my analysis that we are well into the first phase of World War III that it's basically begun?
[03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:08.319]  Yes, it's a world war.
[03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:12.860]  I don't know if it's World War III or World War IV or V. Well, you're right.
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:17.760]  The CIA calls the Cold War World War III, so we're technically World War IV. But that's a little technical.
[03:06:18.059 --> 03:06:18.739]  It's a world war.
[03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:22.479]  And that means that it will be very, very fast, very rapid.
[03:06:22.780 --> 03:06:25.040]  Because as World War II, there was a phase.
[03:06:25.290 --> 03:06:31.129]  Where the world was declared, but it was called the fake war, you know, sort of like a false war.
[03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:35.510]  And then he was very rapidly triggered after, you know, June 18th.
[03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.690]  That's right.
[03:06:35.909 --> 03:06:37.030]  We're out of time, Carlos.
[03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:38.010]  We got Steve Bannon.
[03:06:38.549 --> 03:06:40.489]  And then after the break, more breaking news.
[03:06:40.729 --> 03:06:41.569]  Thank you so much.
[03:06:42.549 --> 03:06:44.309]  It's up to you whether we're going to stay on air.
[03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:45.549]  We're having big victories everywhere.
[03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:47.829]  The enemy wants us off the air more than anybody other than Trump.
[03:06:48.610 --> 03:06:52.489]  It's a smart move to support us, plus it's great products, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:06:53.069 --> 03:06:55.590]  Everybody's been asking me for an update on what's really going on with the tip of the shutdown.
[03:06:55.729 --> 03:06:56.270]  I'm in full wars.
[03:06:56.530 --> 03:07:01.149]  Here it is with Steve Bannon, and then we'll be back in the war room, 3 p.m.
[03:07:01.229 --> 03:07:01.309]  today.
[03:07:01.469 --> 03:07:01.889]  Stay with us.
[03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:03.930]  The incredible warrior, Alex Jones.
[03:07:04.030 --> 03:07:08.579]  So, Alex, last time we left you, The guys were in your control room.
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:09.700]  They're trying to pull the plug.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:13.159]  They had auctioned, but it wasn't public.
[03:07:14.079 --> 03:07:25.760]  The finance group that you had to help or at least guide or give direction to had put in a bid, but all of a sudden the onion and it looked like the parents or people representing the parents won.
[03:07:25.899 --> 03:07:26.879]  It's very confusing.
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:37.600]  And now I understand a judge has stepped in, you filed suits, this thing's all, it's locked down and you still control the assets in the studio, Alex Jones?
[03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:45.299]  Yes, this is the most incredible thing I've personally ever gone through with Lawfare and I've got top bankruptcy lawyers, I've never seen anything.
[03:07:45.739 --> 03:07:53.159]  The group that had the highest bid, not the Onion, I filed suit yesterday, we filed suit today.
[03:07:54.059 --> 03:07:56.040]  My lawyer is upset in the suit.
[03:07:56.139 --> 03:07:57.940]  This is clear bankruptcy, fraud, and criminal.
[03:07:58.059 --> 03:07:58.819]  They quote the code.
[03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:04.680]  My lawyers collectively have been, three of them, practicing law for over 120 years.
[03:08:05.059 --> 03:08:07.399]  And they've never seen anything like it.
[03:08:07.979 --> 03:08:19.319]  And so they had an auction for InfoWars announced that the judge said I'll authorize an auction in the future, but you have to come here and have hearings about what is up for sale.
[03:08:19.850 --> 03:08:28.110]  Then the US trustee assigned by the Justice Department came in and didn't get authorization, but said he had authorization.
[03:08:28.989 --> 03:08:42.530]  Set it for November 13th, last Wednesday, and on Monday, after months of it being set, comes in and says, now the rules have changed, it's a secret sealed bid, and I don't have to accept the highest bidder.
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:48.059]  Then it wasn't till Thursday night after they'd already kicked us out of the building and cut the internet off where I wasn't gonna leave.
[03:08:48.379 --> 03:08:52.260]  And I went over to my own Alex Jones network and got right back up so they didn't really stop us.
[03:08:53.870 --> 03:09:06.829]  Then the winning bidder, the real bidder, the Patriot Group that I've worked for for many years, they actually got all the paperwork, and that's in these exhibit lawsuits that I posted at Real Alex Jones on X. And they admit that it was just all rigged.
[03:09:06.989 --> 03:09:08.409]  They decided to give it to them.
[03:09:08.610 --> 03:09:15.829]  They pledged their future earnings from my defamation case that's on appeal.
[03:09:15.829 --> 03:09:17.090]  You can't legally do that.
[03:09:17.250 --> 03:09:18.950]  It was supposed to be a cash auction.
[03:09:19.129 --> 03:09:20.190]  They didn't do that.
[03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:24.209]  And so they went all over the news and announced that we were shut down.
[03:09:24.989 --> 03:09:30.090]  They called the IT service providers, had Infowars.com shut down.
[03:09:30.809 --> 03:09:32.770]  They came into the building where I was broadcasting.
[03:09:32.930 --> 03:09:33.729]  They showed up right at 8.
[03:09:33.770 --> 03:09:34.530]  We were already on air.
[03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:35.969]  They said get out of there.
[03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:40.010]  They threatened the crew saying you're violating court orders with no court order in their hand.
[03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:43.530]  Again, the judge hadn't even authorized the auction.
[03:09:43.629 --> 03:09:44.530]  There wasn't even an auction.
[03:09:44.569 --> 03:09:45.370]  It was a fake sale.
[03:09:46.049 --> 03:09:46.829]  Masquerading as that.
[03:09:47.010 --> 03:10:03.510]  And then they go on Good Morning America, the so-called Onion owner or Onion CEO, a former MSNBC disinformation specialist or censor, with the head of the Everytown that's now the big global Democrat Party gun control conglomerate that's also anti-free speech.
[03:10:03.690 --> 03:10:05.649]  And they said, we're actually backing all this.
[03:10:05.709 --> 03:10:10.270]  So it's actually the Democratic Party, Soros-funded, main Democrat gun control group.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:11.899]  That's done this.
[03:10:12.059 --> 03:10:21.940]  And then they've been the ones behind the whole thing and the fake lawsuits on me and the Justice Department admitting that they ran it and the PR campaigns and having the judges find me guilty and then having show trials.
[03:10:22.649 --> 03:10:24.729]  And they just came out and said, Alex Jones is over.
[03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:25.329]  It's over.
[03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:26.190]  We own his name.
[03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:28.229]  We own everything, even though none of that was even true.
[03:10:29.170 --> 03:10:31.229]  And it's just absolutely insane.
[03:10:31.430 --> 03:10:35.670]  And so now, the judge has an emergency hearing on Monday.
[03:10:35.829 --> 03:10:37.930]  He hasn't made clear if that'll be the big evidentiary hearing.
[03:10:38.069 --> 03:10:41.309]  He came out last Thursday and said, I didn't even know that there was an auction.
[03:10:41.329 --> 03:10:42.229]  This was quoted in Bloomberg.
[03:10:42.610 --> 03:10:45.489]  And he said, everybody should be very upset and uncomfortable with this.
[03:10:45.989 --> 03:10:48.129]  He said, who is the winning bid to the US trustee?
[03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:51.370]  He said, well, it's not the high bid, but it's the best bid.
[03:10:51.889 --> 03:10:53.409]  And he said, well, what's the amount of money?
[03:10:53.489 --> 03:10:54.930]  He said, I can't tell you.
[03:10:55.510 --> 03:11:05.829]  Then when we got the bidding information that's in our lawsuits, two different big ones filed by both the real bidder that won and by myself, because I'm the sole member of Free Speech Systems, I'm still the owner.
[03:11:06.909 --> 03:11:19.870]  He said, I can't tell you who the winner is to the judge because it was secret that no matter what somebody bid, They would then just pledge their billion and a half dollars towards it so people would think that they were bidding.
[03:11:20.479 --> 03:11:26.739]  But it was impossible because they were bidding imaginary funny money to this.
[03:11:26.840 --> 03:11:34.079]  No one's ever been able to bid an auction with a undecided, still disputed, appealed lawsuit.
[03:11:34.639 --> 03:11:36.059]  So that was kept secret.
[03:11:36.260 --> 03:11:43.579]  And two days before the fake auction, new rules were sent to the folks I was working with that put in the real bid, the winning bid.
[03:11:43.860 --> 03:12:00.030]  And it said to them, you cannot use any derivative payment or credit But then in the documents they got Thursday, the day after the fraudulent hoax sale, it shows all the minutes that the US trustee even attached to it,
[03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:08.170]  how they decided they were gonna give it to the Democrats, and how they said that they could use future money, imaginary money for this.
[03:12:08.489 --> 03:12:13.850]  And so they gave one set of rules to my bidders that thought, this is strange, we were always gonna do cash.
[03:12:14.290 --> 03:12:31.069]  And then had themselves another one that was a secret floating I mean, this is so fantastically ridiculous that my lawyers- Why are they so,
[03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:42.670]  is it because of the InfoWars brand and they want to mock us by turning it into a parody site with phony supplements and bizarre Progressive left fake news.
[03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:44.170]  They want to turn it into a comedy site.
[03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:46.290]  Is that what they want to do?
[03:12:46.409 --> 03:12:52.790]  That's so valuable to them to take the Infowars brand and to mock us and to mock it?
[03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:53.989]  Is that what they're trying to do?
[03:12:55.110 --> 03:12:55.709]  Dead on.
[03:12:55.870 --> 03:13:10.989]  In our lawsuit and in the winning bidder's lawsuit, we have exhibits of them on TV. With the URL and screenshots, exhibits of them in the New York Times, everywhere else, saying we wanna confuse people and make them think it's Alex Jones and talk about flying saucers,
[03:13:11.149 --> 03:13:17.110]  Bigfoot, and chupacabras, and we are going to destroy his brand.
[03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:24.229]  So it's all malicious, intent to do harm, something the judge said he would never allow in the auction because they already tried that to say they'd own my name.
[03:13:24.430 --> 03:13:27.170]  The judge says, no, you gotta have hearings, no auction until that happens.
[03:13:27.270 --> 03:13:28.850]  So they snuck this through and it gets worse.
[03:13:31.260 --> 03:13:36.799]  Imagine, they say we're off the air, they cut the internet power, so I have to run in our backup studio.
[03:13:36.979 --> 03:13:41.239]  We still get up on air, contact our TV and radio station, say, hey, we're here, most of them switched over.
[03:13:41.639 --> 03:13:45.020]  And I'm thinking, okay, we're gonna beat them in court, everything's great.
[03:13:45.739 --> 03:13:58.180]  Then I was so busy, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, I didn't look at the numbers at Infowarsstore.com, one of our main funding systems with t-shirts and books and supplements, things like water filters.
[03:13:58.779 --> 03:14:04.579]  And I didn't look at a separate sponsor that we've had that's the AlexJoneStore.com that I don't own.
[03:14:04.799 --> 03:14:07.700]  So even if they got Infowars, they couldn't get the AlexJoneStore.com.
[03:14:08.260 --> 03:14:11.959]  Well, today, I said, hey, let me check the numbers.
[03:14:12.020 --> 03:14:13.760]  That's how little we're worrying about money.
[03:14:14.239 --> 03:14:16.500]  I figured we'd have a bunch of extra money come in for support.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:21.520]  And again, because I didn't make the point a lot on air, and we checked the emails.
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:23.180]  People said, sorry, we can't support you.
[03:14:23.219 --> 03:14:23.959]  Where do we support?
[03:14:24.299 --> 03:14:27.840]  We can't support InfowarsStore.com since that belongs to them, which it doesn't.
[03:14:28.100 --> 03:14:30.760]  And we can't support Alex Schoen's store because that belongs to them too.
[03:14:31.139 --> 03:14:32.120]  No, it doesn't.
[03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:43.760]  So crippling 70% drop at InfoWars store, crippling 56% drop at AlexSchoenStore.com because I wasn't even thinking about money and didn't realize their hoax that they owned InfoWars.
[03:14:43.860 --> 03:14:44.860]  People think of that as me.
[03:14:46.100 --> 03:14:50.520]  Major damage to the brand's ability to even sell products.
[03:14:50.659 --> 03:14:52.780]  They took all our sponsors over the years, so we direct sale.
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:54.940]  We kind of created that model for media.
[03:14:55.180 --> 03:14:56.180]  A lot of folks do it now.
[03:14:56.399 --> 03:14:57.860]  But that was done out of necessity.
[03:14:59.239 --> 03:15:01.600]  Obviously, it's been said that necessity is the mother of invention.
[03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:04.840]  And so now that's being added to our lawsuit.
[03:15:05.399 --> 03:15:17.049]  We're talking, right now, $400,018 has been lost From the current trend line since last Thursday when they made this announcement.
[03:15:17.690 --> 03:15:19.110]  Crippling, so listeners need to know.
[03:15:19.229 --> 03:15:20.149]  I don't normally come on here and beg.
[03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:22.409]  We would have had plenty of money for the lawsuits.
[03:15:22.549 --> 03:15:23.190]  We would have survived.
[03:15:23.190 --> 03:15:27.250]  Even if they get this, we'd stay on at the Alex Jones Network, except people are confused.
[03:15:27.670 --> 03:15:30.010]  And so they're told I'm over, I'm done.
[03:15:30.649 --> 03:15:33.149]  Mark Twain said rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
[03:15:33.729 --> 03:15:34.690]  No, we're here.
[03:15:36.909 --> 03:15:38.850]  Thealexjonesstore.com is not even owned by me.
[03:15:39.090 --> 03:15:42.149]  They are the backers and the folks with the Alex Jones Network.
[03:15:42.370 --> 03:15:43.889]  We knew this was coming, potentially.
[03:15:44.409 --> 03:15:48.190]  So that's the rebel base, folks, is thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:15:48.389 --> 03:15:55.969]  And now I've got a 400, almost 500, I mean, it's growing deficit because we barely had enough to ensure our operations against the enemy.
[03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:57.649]  And I just didn't even think about it.
[03:15:57.909 --> 03:15:59.569]  And so that's already in the suit.
[03:15:59.729 --> 03:16:00.909]  More is being added to the suit.
[03:16:01.090 --> 03:16:04.110]  I mean, these people, Literally screwed the pooch.
[03:16:04.549 --> 03:16:07.110]  I haven't even talked to other lawyers that have read the cases and seen the documents.
[03:16:07.209 --> 03:16:07.950]  The documents are in here.
[03:16:08.190 --> 03:16:09.409]  I mean, smoking gun.
[03:16:10.010 --> 03:16:12.469]  They are gonna be lucky if they're not wearing striped suits.
[03:16:12.629 --> 03:16:15.549]  I mean, these are the true believers.
[03:16:15.790 --> 03:16:20.229]  Just like the Democrats in Butler We're county saying, we don't care if somebody's already voted repeatedly.
[03:16:20.409 --> 03:16:22.469]  We're gonna violate the law because Donald Trump's bad.
[03:16:22.729 --> 03:16:23.569]  It's the same thing.
[03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:32.270]  These are wild-eyed Democrat Party, Soros main gun control group, literally manipulating and running all this over the years.
[03:16:32.530 --> 03:16:41.489]  Then they go on Good Morning America with Stephanopoulos and unveil themselves as the man behind the curtain and do a victory dance, spike the football in the end zone.
[03:16:42.010 --> 03:16:48.530]  And so they have, just like their lawfare against you and against Trump, and all of it is what pissed off the American people.
[03:16:48.690 --> 03:16:51.350]  Your predictions that America was done has been proven.
[03:16:51.610 --> 03:17:00.129]  And now they are literally, in my opinion, and it's in our filings, in court, we're saying it is criminal, sourcing the US code with their own documents.
[03:17:03.319 --> 03:17:05.520]  Alex, our audience wants to know where to follow this.
[03:17:05.639 --> 03:17:11.219]  So where do they go to get your current show so they can watch that every day, and where do they go to follow you on social media?
[03:17:12.900 --> 03:17:15.079]  At RealAlexJonesOnX, InfoWars is back under our control.
[03:17:15.180 --> 03:17:16.280]  We've been in the building since Friday.
[03:17:16.620 --> 03:17:18.040]  They didn't have the right to even take it.
[03:17:18.139 --> 03:17:19.159]  They didn't give it back to us.
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:19.680]  It was ours.
[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:21.059]  They've totally screwed the pooch.
[03:17:21.159 --> 03:17:22.219]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:17:22.219 --> 03:17:25.780]  We're at RealAlexJonesOnX, and we're at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:17:25.959 --> 03:17:30.180]  The store is in question if they get it, but not AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:17:30.639 --> 03:17:32.680]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is separate, is safe, is our sponsor.
[03:17:32.780 --> 03:17:33.559]  It will keep us on the air.
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:37.440]  Alex Jones, amazing story.
[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:38.500]  We were glad to be there.
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:40.299]  We thought we were gonna be your last guest on that.
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:42.180]  I guess we weren't, but that's good news.
[03:17:42.340 --> 03:17:43.219]  We wanted to keep going.
[03:17:43.319 --> 03:17:43.680]  I love you, Steve.
[03:17:43.899 --> 03:17:44.639]  Keep fighting, brother.
[03:17:45.370 --> 03:17:46.110]  We love you, too.
[03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:47.610]  We know you're never going to stop.
[03:17:47.850 --> 03:17:49.729]  We'll follow this evidentiary hearing on Monday.
[03:17:49.889 --> 03:17:50.930]  Alex Jones, thank you, brother.
[03:17:51.209 --> 03:17:56.229]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:17:57.309 --> 03:18:00.790]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[03:18:01.010 --> 03:18:03.590]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[03:18:03.729 --> 03:18:04.469]  I'm still not in shape.
[03:18:05.409 --> 03:18:06.790]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[03:18:06.930 --> 03:18:07.870]  Don't tell me eating right.
[03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:08.590]  I'm not going to buy that.
[03:18:09.470 --> 03:18:12.229]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[03:18:13.149 --> 03:18:14.069]  Oh, no.
[03:18:15.090 --> 03:18:16.950]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[03:18:17.290 --> 03:18:23.030]  Well, I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.989]  That's why, right here.
[03:18:24.729 --> 03:18:29.829]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:31.610]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:18:31.950 --> 03:18:33.549]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[03:18:36.309 --> 03:18:40.209]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[03:18:40.350 --> 03:18:43.510]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[03:18:44.110 --> 03:18:46.969]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[03:18:47.129 --> 03:18:50.309]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:59.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Chase Geiser, your host, for the next 24 minutes and 18 seconds before the great Owen Schroyer takes over, hosting the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:18:59.530 --> 03:19:02.329]  It is an honor and a pleasure to be speaking to this audience today.
[03:19:04.010 --> 03:19:06.209]  At the command center for Infowars.
[03:19:07.729 --> 03:19:17.270]  And I want to try to get into some of the news today, but I want to specifically tell you a story as it relates to my experience here at Infowars.
[03:19:17.469 --> 03:19:33.229]  So you get an idea of the level of screwed up and corrupt this establishment attack on Infowars is and has been over the course of the years.
[03:19:34.159 --> 03:19:40.079]  Now, I've been here since the beginning of July, the very last days of June in 2023.
[03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:46.920]  And I had guest hosted here a couple of times for a couple of weeks.
[03:19:47.239 --> 03:19:50.500]  Harrison was away on paternity leave for a couple of weeks, so I filled in for him for free.
[03:19:51.159 --> 03:19:55.700]  And I'd been around because my podcast kind of leveraged me into being able to be a guest.
[03:19:55.819 --> 03:19:58.000]  And I happened to live 15 minutes down the road from here.
[03:19:59.159 --> 03:20:00.700]  And I finally asked for a job.
[03:20:02.209 --> 03:20:08.069]  And I knew something was abundantly messed up when I went in for my offer interview.
[03:20:08.250 --> 03:20:09.649]  So I had an interview and then I had an offer.
[03:20:12.290 --> 03:20:26.110]  And it wasn't anybody's fault who works here, but it was a time, much like now, but a time when this operation was totally under the control of the CRO, run by the state, approved by the state.
[03:20:26.549 --> 03:20:28.010]  Nobody's had raises in years.
[03:20:29.290 --> 03:20:37.069]  And I'm about to outline all of the attacks in ways in which the state and the establishment have endeavored to shut this operation down.
[03:20:37.370 --> 03:20:41.030]  And so this story will make sense in the context of this.
[03:20:41.149 --> 03:20:42.770]  So I submitted my resume.
[03:20:42.770 --> 03:20:47.690]  I had worked as a social media advertiser for years running my own company.
[03:20:48.149 --> 03:20:49.389]  And you can throw up the B-roll.
[03:20:49.729 --> 03:20:56.190]  On Fiverr alone as a freelancer, I've worked with companies in over 30% of the world's nations.
[03:20:56.190 --> 03:20:58.209]  I've made over half a million dollars on Fiverr.
[03:20:58.909 --> 03:21:00.129]  Alone, before I worked here.
[03:21:01.149 --> 03:21:05.790]  And I'd submitted these details of my resume for this job.
[03:21:05.889 --> 03:21:11.110]  Look, I make a half a million dollars doing advertising and social media management for companies all over the world.
[03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:12.709]  I also have a successful podcast.
[03:21:12.709 --> 03:21:16.350]  I also have 180,000 followers on X. I've got a personal brand.
[03:21:16.489 --> 03:21:19.350]  I mean, there are so many reasons that I can be helpful here.
[03:21:19.409 --> 03:21:23.170]  That's a screenshot that I took today from my Fiverr account, which has been dormant ever since I started working here.
[03:21:24.909 --> 03:21:26.309]  And they brought me in.
[03:21:29.889 --> 03:21:37.790]  For the interview, for the second interview where they were going to offer me the job, and they said, Chase, we are in a position right now to pay you $40,000 as a salary.
[03:21:38.069 --> 03:21:42.909]  And you have to quit working with clients, and you have to work full time.
[03:21:43.250 --> 03:21:45.409]  And we're sorry, but we're not going to pay you more than $40,000.
[03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:47.809]  I mean, after I showed them all this, after all that I'd done.
[03:21:48.129 --> 03:21:50.229]  And it wasn't Alex, it wasn't any of the leadership here.
[03:21:50.409 --> 03:21:57.450]  It was the state, it was the feds, it was this corrupt regime that came in to intentionally subvert all of the operations.
[03:21:58.409 --> 03:22:07.430]  And I knew then that no rational business person, because I have worked with hundreds of very rational and successful business people, would offer someone like me a job for just $40,000.
[03:22:07.709 --> 03:22:08.989]  I mean, that is the epitome of retarded.
[03:22:09.049 --> 03:22:12.510]  I'm not trying to brag here, but it's like hiring Steve Jobs to clean the dishes.
[03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:16.629]  And so I knew I had to take the job.
[03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:25.520]  Because if they're doing that kind of thing, if they're making these kinds of decisions, Then they are definitely under attack from the inside.
[03:22:25.559 --> 03:22:26.379]  So I took the job.
[03:22:26.520 --> 03:22:27.459]  I called my dad.
[03:22:27.659 --> 03:22:30.780]  He was kind enough to loan me $30,000 so I could afford to work here.
[03:22:30.840 --> 03:22:33.020]  I promised him that I would get a raise within three months, and I did.
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:38.139]  Now, as soon as I started working here, I began doing everything that I can to make the place more efficient, do the best I could.
[03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:51.950]  Things like finding the old transcripts, transcribing and finding the old operations, creating systems to find clips faster, helping in any way I could, doing the job that I was hired for initially, which was just to post articles once an hour on all the social media platforms.
[03:22:52.270 --> 03:23:01.170]  And I was able to weasel my way in through my podcast following to getting an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy.
[03:23:02.180 --> 03:23:04.180]  And I could only get 15 minutes with him.
[03:23:04.260 --> 03:23:10.280]  And the only reason that I wanted Vivek Ramaswamy on my podcast was because I knew Elon Musk would listen to Vivek.
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:13.520]  Now, of course, you know they're co-chairing the Department of Government Efficiency.
[03:23:14.739 --> 03:23:30.159]  And the only way I could get Elon Musk to listen to the Infowars case was to get Vivek Ramaswamy to come on and in 15 minutes somehow get him to say that X should allow Alex Jones and Infowars back on its platforms.
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:30.860]  Let's run that clip.
[03:23:32.079 --> 03:23:43.659]  With respect to Alex Jones or anybody else being censored from Twitter, if Twitter's a free speech platform, which is what Elon Musk's thesis for running the platform is, free speech means that there's no such thing as a wrong opinion.
[03:23:43.860 --> 03:23:46.239]  We fought an American Revolution in this country for what?
[03:23:46.540 --> 03:23:55.940]  For the vision that we the people Decide in a constitutional republic how we settle our differences through free speech and open debate in the public square.
[03:23:56.219 --> 03:24:00.719]  Now that old world monster rears its ugly head again saying that, no, no, no, we don't trust the people.
[03:24:00.819 --> 03:24:01.760]  I reject that vision.
[03:24:01.879 --> 03:24:04.420]  The American Revolution rejects that vision.
[03:24:04.600 --> 03:24:07.000]  That is what the World Economic Forum agenda is about.
[03:24:07.219 --> 03:24:09.000]  It is a 1776 question.
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:10.700]  I stand on the side of the great uprising.
[03:24:11.469 --> 03:24:14.209]  Standing up and saying absolutely not, heck no to the great reset.
[03:24:14.590 --> 03:24:24.110]  We the people decide as citizens of sovereign nations how we actually determine our future through self-determination.
[03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:36.290]  Now, I'm not saying that it's because of that video or that clip, but within four months of that clip going viral on social media, Alex Jones was back on X. Which was step one of the operation.
[03:24:36.450 --> 03:24:45.290]  Then I knew, because of what I witnessed in these meetings, that the state was intentionally subverting and sabotaging our ability to get new inventory for the Infowars store.
[03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:57.020]  We had like a dozen products, and we could get reorders sometimes, and they were trying to toe the line between Plausible deniability as to whether or not they were really making the right decision or not.
[03:24:57.120 --> 03:25:05.059]  And it was just crippling the decisions that were being made, the way that we were chained down in Infowars from making the business decisions that we knew were the best for our business.
[03:25:05.139 --> 03:25:10.180]  Because you gotta keep in mind, we never went bankrupt because of any bad business decision.
[03:25:10.459 --> 03:25:13.639]  Like most businesses when they go bankrupt, it's because they failed at running the business.
[03:25:13.819 --> 03:25:18.680]  We went bankrupt because of a fluke, unprecedented $1.5 billion judgment.
[03:25:19.250 --> 03:25:24.209]  The highest defamation judgment in the history of defamation judgments happened to Alex Jones.
[03:25:24.370 --> 03:25:27.530]  Had nothing to do with whether or not he could run a successful, profitable business.
[03:25:27.709 --> 03:25:28.909]  I mean, this business was profitable.
[03:25:29.409 --> 03:25:39.309]  But now they're coming in and they're trying to run the business as if the business is the reason that we're bankrupt and as if they need an outsider to come in to make sure that our assets and our business decisions are being handled responsibly.
[03:25:39.690 --> 03:25:43.590]  So I knew it wasn't long before the Infowars store would give out.
[03:25:44.530 --> 03:25:47.409]  I thought, wow, well, I had a close friend, Matt Couch.
[03:25:47.549 --> 03:25:48.649]  Many of you have heard Matt Couch.
[03:25:48.829 --> 03:25:49.829]  He's an American hero.
[03:25:49.969 --> 03:25:50.430]  He's a patriot.
[03:25:50.590 --> 03:25:57.129]  You can follow him at, I believe, at RealMattCouch on X. And he told me about the Bigley boys.
[03:25:58.069 --> 03:26:04.030]  These boys in Arkansas that act like the cast from the original Red Dawn.
[03:26:04.329 --> 03:26:10.090]  I mean, they are just patriotic, anti-communist, hustling, hardworking, red-blooded Americans.
[03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:12.030]  And I knew that I needed to somehow...
[03:26:13.350 --> 03:26:24.290]  Establish a business relationship with Bigly because if they ran a store for us that was outside of the purview of Infowars, then that could never be taken away from us.
[03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:29.850]  So what I did was I called the publisher of Alex's books.
[03:26:31.099 --> 03:26:32.280]  Great Reset and The Great Awakening.
[03:26:32.459 --> 03:26:36.680]  And I asked him to publish my book, and I got Alex to agree to write the foreword of it.
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:37.780]  And I'm not here to plug my book.
[03:26:37.860 --> 03:26:38.659]  I don't care if you buy it.
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:39.399]  I don't even want you to buy it.
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:49.299]  I'd much rather have you sign up as a VIP on the alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. But I knew that if the book came out and Alex wrote the foreword of it, then I could get on basically any podcast that I want.
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:50.360]  So I started doing a podcast.
[03:26:50.540 --> 03:26:51.299]  I did Tim Pool.
[03:26:51.459 --> 03:26:51.860]  I did others.
[03:26:53.129 --> 03:26:56.729]  And I got on the Hodge Twins podcast knowing that Bigley worked for them.
[03:26:56.829 --> 03:27:11.129]  And as soon as I met up and hooked up with the Bigley boys, the day I was in the airport on the way back from doing the Hodge Twins podcast, that was when the process began to launch the Alex Jones store, which has saved this operation, which will fund the next operation.
[03:27:11.569 --> 03:27:17.850]  And then I understood that if they take this place down, then they're also gonna take away Alex's ability to own anything else.
[03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:22.530]  I mean, anything else that he incorporates is gonna be subject to seizure from these courts.
[03:27:25.340 --> 03:27:31.280]  So I saw to it that the Alex Jones network was incorporated outside of Alex's name, and that we would have that operation in place.
[03:27:32.940 --> 03:27:34.180]  And this is just the beginning.
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:39.639]  I mean, the entire time that I was working here, we pay to serve you the videos on band.video.
[03:27:39.780 --> 03:27:44.239]  Every time you watch a video on band.video, and we always encourage you to do so and to download it, we actually have to pay for that.
[03:27:44.459 --> 03:27:48.120]  Our bill ranges from $100,000 to over a quarter million dollars a month.
[03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:57.389]  Depending on how many people watch our broadcasts on band.video, I tried like a mother to get our entire systems backed up by rumble so we wouldn't have to pay to serve them.
[03:27:57.690 --> 03:27:59.690]  And they put a wall on that too.
[03:27:59.829 --> 03:28:06.389]  The state put a wall on that, would not approve any transitions there because they wanted us to leak money into the system.
[03:28:07.510 --> 03:28:10.329]  And then I saw last week that we were shut down for just 24 hours.
[03:28:10.450 --> 03:28:13.469]  Of course, we were on air the whole time to the same audience because we had the backup network.
[03:28:14.620 --> 03:28:21.920]  When we fired back up, they had deleted all of the pre-roll ads that run the first 15 seconds of every video on Bandit Video.
[03:28:22.079 --> 03:28:23.459]  Millions upon millions of views.
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:24.579]  Pre-roll videos gone.
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:27.299]  Thousands upon thousands of dollars in sales missed.
[03:28:27.399 --> 03:28:30.780]  And it took us four days to figure it out because we've been scrambling trying to put all the pieces back together.
[03:28:32.780 --> 03:28:34.979]  And as a coincidence, I don't know if this was them or not.
[03:28:35.059 --> 03:28:35.700]  I'm not saying that it was.
[03:28:35.799 --> 03:28:36.540]  I don't know who did it.
[03:28:36.620 --> 03:28:46.860]  But as a coincidence, as soon as all of our computers were seized and scanned, someone found a way to log into a GiveSendGo account that is not associated with free speech systems and shut that down.
[03:28:47.139 --> 03:28:54.799]  Luckily, we have a relationship with the CEO of GiveSendGo, Jacob Wells, a great Christian and patriot, who called us, let us know, fixed it.
[03:28:54.879 --> 03:28:58.860]  We were able to ensure that we had all the money saved and then it wasn't screwed up the way that was done.
[03:29:01.139 --> 03:29:16.059]  And then after they'd done that, the pre-roll, the give, send, go, we still see on global-tetrahedron.com that The Onion and Global Tetrahedron, the parent company of The Onion, is claiming that they own Infowars, which is causing irreparable damage to our brand.
[03:29:16.139 --> 03:29:17.239]  They do not own us.
[03:29:18.180 --> 03:29:26.100]  The judge ruled that he was not going to give them the company last week after the auction, and there's going to be an evidentiary hearing, more court hearings about this.
[03:29:26.239 --> 03:29:27.579]  None of that money is going to them.
[03:29:27.659 --> 03:29:30.440]  They are just illegally claiming that they own Infowars.
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:35.719]  Infowars intentionally trying to damage your brain.
[03:29:35.899 --> 03:29:51.399]  So between the pre-roll, the rumble business decisions, the give, send, go, and the global tetrahedron website saying that it owns Infowars and their massive media campaign saying that they own Infowars when they don't, it has cost us tens upon tens, if not hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:29:51.600 --> 03:30:01.000]  They have intentionally tried to sabotage this on every front, but they're not going to be able to pull it off because we are always one step ahead, because the truth is always one step ahead.
[03:30:03.969 --> 03:30:06.690]  In other ways, too, by refusing to give people raises that they deserve.
[03:30:06.809 --> 03:30:08.309]  Everybody here is drastically underpaid.
[03:30:09.569 --> 03:30:15.770]  They're trying to coax people away from this operation to pull the rug out from under Alex Jones so people go work somewhere else.
[03:30:15.889 --> 03:30:18.770]  It's only because of their loyalty and your support that we're in this fight.
[03:30:18.989 --> 03:30:23.049]  It's practically a charity case at this point that we're in this fight to stay on this network.
[03:30:23.489 --> 03:30:32.610]  Because we believe in freedom of speech, we understand that if we exit the fight, the risks of allowing humanity to fall to these globalists are so much greater than the risks associated with fighting them head on.
[03:30:32.690 --> 03:30:34.670]  And we are stronger, so we are fighting them head on.
[03:30:36.319 --> 03:30:38.280]  I'm gonna show clip number five here in a second from The View.
[03:30:38.459 --> 03:30:51.200]  I want to see these people in some months ahead to be forced to come out and give this Otto Warmbier-esque confession to the public about the crimes that they have committed, the misinformation that they have committed.
[03:30:51.379 --> 03:30:52.799]  I vow to you right now.
[03:30:52.799 --> 03:30:53.959]  I vow to you today.
[03:30:56.420 --> 03:31:01.500]  That as far as all of these people who have attacked Infowars are concerned, who have illegally attacked Infowars.
[03:31:01.540 --> 03:31:04.680]  I'm not talking about random people who speak out against Infowars.
[03:31:04.780 --> 03:31:05.639]  I believe in freedom of speech.
[03:31:05.780 --> 03:31:11.799]  But those who have maliciously and intentionally engaged in fraud to bring this operation down.
[03:31:11.959 --> 03:31:15.739]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[03:31:16.379 --> 03:31:20.280]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[03:31:20.620 --> 03:31:21.379]  Listen again.
[03:31:21.659 --> 03:31:25.219]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[03:31:26.959 --> 03:31:28.420]  And then you'll be coming out like clip five.
[03:31:28.579 --> 03:31:28.840]  Let's see.
[03:31:29.959 --> 03:31:30.620]  On screen.
[03:31:31.399 --> 03:31:33.200]  Sonny, you have a legal note.
[03:31:33.200 --> 03:31:34.120]  I do have a legal note.
[03:31:34.239 --> 03:31:34.879]  Thank you, Whoopi.
[03:31:37.040 --> 03:31:55.420]  Matt Gaetz has long denied all allegations, calling the claims, quote, invented, and saying in a statement to ABC News that this false smear following a three-year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism, that DOJ investigation was closed with no charges being brought.
[03:31:56.420 --> 03:31:57.219]  We'll be right back.
[03:31:58.559 --> 03:31:59.680]  Well, there you have it.
[03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:01.200]  And I can't wait.
[03:32:01.479 --> 03:32:14.040]  While they bring us on the cusp of World War III using long range missiles inside of Russia after Russia has repeatedly said for months, even years, that this was only going to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons.
[03:32:14.280 --> 03:32:17.620]  They had a nuclear weapons policy from back in 2020.
[03:32:17.620 --> 03:32:27.850]  It was recently updated in September by Vladimir Putin to lower the threshold of what Russia would determine Excuseable use of nuclear weapons.
[03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:29.350]  This is clip number eight here from Reuters.
[03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:35.329]  Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks.
[03:32:35.530 --> 03:32:41.510]  And Moscow said Ukraine had deep struck inside Russia with U.S.-made Atakams missiles.
[03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:42.250]  Let's watch them.
[03:32:42.530 --> 03:32:43.670]  Atakams, excuse me.
[03:32:44.129 --> 03:32:50.350]  On the same day Moscow said Ukraine struck deep into Russia with U.S.-made Atakams missiles...
[03:32:51.420 --> 03:32:59.780]  President Vladimir Putin lowered Russia's threshold for a nuclear response to be able to respond to a broader range of conventional attacks.
[03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:07.719]  Russia has the world's biggest nuclear arsenal and Putin is the main decision maker on how to use it.
[03:33:09.709 --> 03:33:17.389]  The change was published on the 1,000th day of the war in Ukraine and drew swift rebuke from its president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
[03:33:17.610 --> 03:33:22.329]  Especially this day, they presented nuclear weapons strategy.
[03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:23.010]  Why?
[03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:25.850]  They didn't present peace strategy.
[03:33:26.350 --> 03:33:27.569]  Did you hear it?
[03:33:28.090 --> 03:33:29.969]  Did you read about it?
[03:33:30.049 --> 03:33:30.670]  No, of course.
[03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:33.469]  Of course, nuclear weapons strategy.
[03:33:33.969 --> 03:33:35.149]  Putin wants war.
[03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:45.780]  Speaking in Brazil, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned against cherry-picking what's in the new doctrine, saying, I hope this doctrine will be read.
[03:33:46.659 --> 03:33:49.739]  The old one said Russia could fight nuclear with nuclear.
[03:33:49.920 --> 03:34:01.559]  And not only are they escalating us into global nuclear war, but we just got out of a massive psychological war in which we, the American people, and the rest of the world were victims of a biological weapon.
[03:34:02.260 --> 03:34:04.940]  We have all been attacked in biological warfare.
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:09.719]  We have all been victims of a biological weapon, and our government is too cowardly to admit it.
[03:34:09.940 --> 03:34:16.459]  Instead, they tried to weaponize it and monetize it by pushing these vaccines, which are another version of biological warfare.
[03:34:16.559 --> 03:34:17.219]  This is clip number 10.
[03:34:17.420 --> 03:34:22.340]  This is a compilation of Bill, Rachel Maddow, and others stating that vaccines stop transmission.
[03:34:22.459 --> 03:34:23.299]  I'm gonna show you a little bit of this.
[03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:37.620]  We should be able to manufacture a lot of vaccines and that vaccine, key goal is to stop the transmission, to get the immunity levels up so that you get almost no infection going on whatsoever.
[03:34:37.959 --> 03:34:46.500]  Everyone who takes the vaccine is not just protecting themselves but Reducing their transmission to other people and allowing society to get back to normal.
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:48.540]  We can kind of almost see the end.
[03:34:48.819 --> 03:34:50.879]  We're vaccinating so very fast.
[03:34:51.319 --> 03:34:52.200]  Okay, I see you get it.
[03:34:52.319 --> 03:35:08.079]  They're bringing us on the cuffs of World War III. We've been victims of a biological attack and then our government, instead of fighting back against that because they were too cowardly to stand up to China and the others responsible for this, knowing that they themselves and the democratic machine funded a lot of this gain-of-function research after Fauci lied about it, he's still not in prison.
[03:35:09.440 --> 03:35:11.959]  Just decided to monetize it, make a ton of money off of the vaccines.
[03:35:12.260 --> 03:35:17.559]  Now we've got Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telling the G20 panel that we have to fight so-called climate change.
[03:35:17.620 --> 03:35:18.739]  So they're attacking us on the climate.
[03:35:18.879 --> 03:35:20.100]  They're attacking us on the vaccines.
[03:35:20.280 --> 03:35:23.260]  They're attacking us literally with World War III. This is clip number 14.
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:28.159]  It's really, really easy when you're in a short-term survive.
[03:35:28.159 --> 03:35:30.139]  I got to be able to pay the rent this month.
[03:35:30.180 --> 03:35:39.319]  I got to be able to buy groceries for my kids to say, okay, let's Put climate change as a slightly lower priority.
[03:35:40.079 --> 03:35:41.940]  And that's something that's instinctive.
[03:35:42.020 --> 03:35:46.340]  When the storm comes, you want to hunker down and just sort of huddle up and wait for it to blow over.
[03:35:46.540 --> 03:35:49.739]  We can't do that around climate change.
[03:35:49.899 --> 03:35:54.829]  And unfortunately, And so do you think that they're weaponizing this or do you think that it's a legitimate threat?
[03:35:54.829 --> 03:36:02.469]  Because it seems like every threat that we've experienced, at least over the course of the last several decades, has been entirely manufactured by the political industrial complex.
[03:36:02.629 --> 03:36:07.190]  Not just the military industrial complex, but the entire political industrial complex.
[03:36:07.409 --> 03:36:10.030]  The green energy companies that are in bed with the political class.
[03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:13.590]  The weapons companies, of course, that are in bed with the political class.
[03:36:13.770 --> 03:36:16.329]  The pharmaceutical companies that are in bed with the political class.
[03:36:17.079 --> 03:36:25.260]  Now we have Chairman Comer revealing that a new whistleblower in a different state claims that FEMA purposely avoided homes of Trump supporters when providing disaster relief.
[03:36:25.379 --> 03:36:26.719]  Oh, I thought they were supposed to care about us.
[03:36:26.899 --> 03:36:35.020]  This is clip number 15, after they're acting like they care about democracy and the people so much, proving that our government is intentionally harming political dissidents.
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:35.299]  15.
[03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:53.079]  During the recess for votes, my staff made contact with a new whistleblower who provided a credible account that a FEMA contractor visited the home of an elderly disabled veteran's family around October 10th following Hurricane Helene.
[03:36:54.329 --> 03:36:59.170]  While there, the FEMA contractor recommended- And it's boring as hell, so I'm not going to make you watch the whole minute.
[03:36:59.729 --> 03:37:02.489]  But this is just another example of how they come after us.
[03:37:02.590 --> 03:37:11.729]  And if that wasn't enough, if World War III isn't enough, if bioweapons aren't enough, if vaccines aren't enough, if climate lies aren't enough, now they're coming after us by opening our border wide open.
[03:37:11.850 --> 03:37:14.110]  They've allowed over 20 million people to invade the United States.
[03:37:14.209 --> 03:37:15.049]  This is clip number 16.
[03:37:15.209 --> 03:37:15.969]  Don't cross that line.
[03:37:16.090 --> 03:37:16.690]  Trump borders are.
[03:37:16.850 --> 03:37:20.450]  Tom Homan warns mayors and governors harboring illegals is a felony.
[03:37:20.629 --> 03:37:21.049]  Let's watch.
[03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:33.510]  What happens to a mayor or a local police department chief that is under Democratic leadership that obstructs ICE in your federal agents that are helping get these deportations?
[03:37:33.610 --> 03:37:34.469]  What happens to them?
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:39.159]  Well, first of all, if they want to help us get the hell out of the way, we're going to do it.
[03:37:39.239 --> 03:37:42.340]  If I got sent twice the amount of resources to that city, that's what we're going to do.
[03:37:42.780 --> 03:37:46.620]  If they ever give us access to the jail, that would mean less agents in the community.
[03:37:46.799 --> 03:37:51.239]  For them pushing back and not letting us in the jail, it just means more agents are going to be in the community, so they're hurting themselves.
[03:37:51.620 --> 03:37:52.500]  Finally, I'll say this.
[03:37:52.739 --> 03:37:53.879]  They need to educate themselves.
[03:37:54.100 --> 03:37:55.059]  They need to review this.
[03:37:55.559 --> 03:38:07.559]  Title 8, United States Code, 1324, triple I. Read about that and don't cross that line because it is a felony to harbor and conceal an illegal alien from ICE. Read the statute, don't cross that line.
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:09.940]  That's a warning from Tom Holman.
[03:38:10.079 --> 03:38:11.440]  So they're attacking us on every front.
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:20.520]  World War III on the cusp with climate change, with bioweapons, with vaccines, with lie after lie about the border, with lie after lie about everything.
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:30.420]  Abusing FEMA to ensure that Trump supporters wouldn't get any aid, trying to weaponize a hurricane to keep Trump supporters for showing up after this landslide victory.
[03:38:32.229 --> 03:38:33.930]  And like I said the other day, I'm gonna say it again.
[03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:37.610]  On November 5th, we did not win a war, we started one.
[03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:42.110]  It was the moment that we stood up and decided as a nation that we were going to fight back.
[03:38:42.370 --> 03:38:51.610]  They'd been attacking us, bombing us, picking at us, raiding us, abusing us for year after year, lying to us for year after year, like an abusive relationship.
[03:38:52.090 --> 03:38:54.930]  Just beating us around and then telling us it's our fault because we're Nazis.
[03:38:55.129 --> 03:38:57.069]  We deserve to be beaten because we're Nazis.
[03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:59.510]  On November 5th, we said, actually, you know what?
[03:38:59.629 --> 03:39:05.569]  What you've done over the course of the last eight years constitutes an act of war against the American people.
[03:39:05.590 --> 03:39:11.790]  So we, the people of America, declare war on you, not independence from you because we are reclaiming our country.
[03:39:11.969 --> 03:39:13.010]  We are not running from it.
[03:39:13.090 --> 03:39:14.329]  We are not hiding from it.
[03:39:14.569 --> 03:39:16.069]  We are not declaring independence from it.
[03:39:16.149 --> 03:39:17.409]  We are recapturing it.
[03:39:17.530 --> 03:39:18.850]  We are taking it back.
[03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:20.290]  And that is when the war started.
[03:39:20.430 --> 03:39:21.790]  So now things are more dire.
[03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:23.329]  They're more dangerous than they've ever been.
[03:39:23.350 --> 03:39:24.309]  And it's fun to celebrate.
[03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:28.610]  I know the Founding Fathers celebrated like hell after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
[03:39:28.850 --> 03:39:33.969]  There are bar tab records, very well documented, of how much money they spent the night they signed the Declaration of Independence.
[03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:36.709]  But that was not the end of a conflict with Britain.
[03:39:37.280 --> 03:39:41.899]  That was the beginning of the greatest war in human history, the American Revolution.
[03:39:42.219 --> 03:39:45.559]  And thus we are in the American Revolution 2.0.
[03:39:45.700 --> 03:39:48.979]  This is the next great installment of our story.
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:52.520]  The war has just begun, and the empire is coming now.
[03:39:53.260 --> 03:39:54.620]  They know where we are.
[03:39:54.780 --> 03:39:57.000]  They know where the base on Hoth is.
[03:39:57.100 --> 03:39:58.620]  They know where the shield generators are.
[03:39:58.819 --> 03:40:05.860]  They are going to attack like hell with lawfare, with arrests, with audits, with everything you can possibly imagine.
[03:40:06.620 --> 03:40:10.459]  And that's why you have to To do everything that you can to keep Infowars in the fight.
[03:40:10.780 --> 03:40:15.299]  That's why you have to go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP and sign up.
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:22.899]  And if you can't sign up or you don't want to sign up, even though you should, you pay 30 bucks and you get $40 in store credit, then please just get something, whether it's a shirt or a supplement.
[03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:23.940]  All the products are awesome.
[03:40:24.079 --> 03:40:37.059]  Even if it was just a random store that wasn't owned or operated or partnered with Alex Jones in any sort of way, I would still be buying the supplements, the hats, the shirts, the hoodies, the stickers, the coins, the knives, the amazing products.
[03:40:37.290 --> 03:40:39.670]  Plus, you get chances to win amazing trucks from this store.
[03:40:39.770 --> 03:40:40.690]  It's that good of a store.
[03:40:40.809 --> 03:40:42.049]  This is a competitive store.
[03:40:42.069 --> 03:40:43.870]  We're not asking for charity.
[03:40:44.209 --> 03:40:52.049]  We're just asking for you to choose to buy awesome stuff from us because you're not just buying the products when you pay on thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:55.290]  You're also paying to support and fight for liberty.
[03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:58.809]  And I've got two little girls.
[03:40:58.930 --> 03:41:01.690]  One's gonna be four in January, the other's just one.
[03:41:02.409 --> 03:41:03.610]  She'll be two in May.
[03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:08.489]  I don't want them to grow up on a radiated planet full of radiated men.
[03:41:08.649 --> 03:41:15.790]  I don't want them to grow up with prostitution and cannibalism rampant in the streets because all of civilization's infrastructure has been destroyed.
[03:41:16.069 --> 03:41:22.850]  I don't want them to grow up under tyranny, worrying about whether they say something when they're 14 will interfere with them legally being able to get a job when they're 24.
[03:41:23.149 --> 03:41:30.090]  I don't want them growing up under the leftist version of utopia, which is the equivalent of what I would think of as hell.
[03:41:31.930 --> 03:41:35.010]  And I know many of you have children or you have grandchildren out there.
[03:41:35.569 --> 03:41:38.049]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:41:38.190 --> 03:41:38.930]  Get something.
[03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:40.090]  Sign up for the VIP club.
[03:41:40.270 --> 03:41:41.290]  The products are amazing.
[03:41:41.409 --> 03:41:42.270]  They'll make you smarter.
[03:41:42.510 --> 03:41:43.409]  They'll make you healthier.
[03:41:43.750 --> 03:41:46.450]  And they're fighting for liberty all at the same time.
[03:41:46.510 --> 03:41:47.409]  It's a no-brainer, folks.
[03:41:48.739 --> 03:41:59.459]  Because Infowars is absolutely instrumental, absolutely pivotal in securing our liberties against this leftist tyranny because they almost have a monopoly on information in this country.
[03:41:59.819 --> 03:42:02.479]  They have all of the mainstream media outlets, even though they're dying.
[03:42:02.620 --> 03:42:06.879]  They have all of the mainstream newspapers, channels, radio stations, even though they're dying.
[03:42:07.059 --> 03:42:10.719]  They have all of the mainstream messaging through Hollywood and everything.
[03:42:10.879 --> 03:42:13.700]  Even subtle themes in all of our movies now are leftist.
[03:42:14.620 --> 03:42:17.700]  About self-sacrifice for the collective good, if you pay attention.
[03:42:19.200 --> 03:42:35.840]  They're in all of our educational institutions, not to mention all of our other institutions, brainwashing our children into questioning their very own gender, and then forcing irreversible operations and medical procedures on them before they can realize what's been done to them.
[03:42:37.420 --> 03:42:44.840]  The only places left with free speech are some alternative media podcasts like Joe Rogan, of course the Alex Jones Show on Infowars, and Axe.
[03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:48.379]  So we really are the last bastion.
[03:42:48.479 --> 03:42:49.600]  We really are the tip of the spear.
[03:42:49.840 --> 03:43:02.180]  This is really the last place you can go to support with 100% full assurance that patriots will do everything they can to fight for Western culture and American values as set up by the Founding Fathers.
[03:43:02.379 --> 03:43:08.340]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and stay tuned for Owen Schroer hosting The War Room right on the other side.
[03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:12.129]  Here's the facts in 60 seconds.
[03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:17.270]  The Justice Department came into my bankruptcy, has tried to shut us down twice since May.
[03:43:17.530 --> 03:43:19.090]  The latest case was last week.
[03:43:19.549 --> 03:43:20.950]  The judge shut them down.
[03:43:21.069 --> 03:43:21.989]  They were thrown out of the building.
[03:43:22.450 --> 03:43:23.329]  Crimes were committed.
[03:43:23.569 --> 03:43:25.209]  It's very clear they're in a lot of trouble.
[03:43:25.409 --> 03:43:27.049]  I filed counter lawsuits.
[03:43:27.430 --> 03:43:28.290]  You name it.
[03:43:29.239 --> 03:43:30.620]  Infowarsstore.com is in limbo.
[03:43:30.760 --> 03:43:32.420]  If you order there, you'll get your products.
[03:43:32.899 --> 03:43:46.700]  But thealexjonesstore.com is our great sponsors in Arkansas with t-shirts and great supplements that are funding not just Infowars, but the Alex Jones Network in case this gets shut down at another hearing next week.
[03:43:46.979 --> 03:43:50.680]  So, a lot of people aren't going to thealexjonesstore.com right now.
[03:43:50.719 --> 03:43:53.319]  We're getting messages, oh, we don't want to give money to The Onion.
[03:43:53.899 --> 03:43:59.600]  The Onion didn't get InfoWars, and they don't own Alex Jones, and they don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:00.659]  I don't even own that.
[03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:01.459]  It's the sponsor.
[03:44:01.819 --> 03:44:14.879]  So again, when you go there and get great Trump gear, Alex Jones gear, Patriot gear, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, Collectible posters, incredible designer knives, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:19.120]  You are keeping me on the air one way or another, and we need the funds.
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:24.200]  Over the weekend, folks, we saw our funds cut in half, and people told us, well, we don't want to give it to The Onion.
[03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:26.079]  The Onion does not own me.
[03:44:26.200 --> 03:44:28.540]  They do not own the Alex Jones Store.com.
[03:44:54.359 --> 03:44:56.100]  I'm going to say it again.
[03:44:56.319 --> 03:44:57.879]  It's not owned by me.
[03:44:58.260 --> 03:44:59.739]  It's not owned by the Onion.
[03:44:59.940 --> 03:45:01.559]  It's not owned by the Easter Bunny.
[03:45:01.719 --> 03:45:09.559]  It's owned by great patriots in Arkansas with their own factories, making their own knives, t-shirts, and then private labeling top supplements and selling them to you.
[03:45:09.719 --> 03:45:11.799]  It's the alicejonesstore.com.
[03:45:11.799 --> 03:45:12.600]  It's the future.
[03:45:12.979 --> 03:45:18.979]  One way or another, become a VIP for 30 bucks a month, cancel any time, you get $40 to spend in the store.
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:21.059]  So if you're going to support, you got to be a VIP member.
[03:45:21.970 --> 03:45:25.489]  TheAlexJonesStore.com forward slash VIP. Now take action.
[03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:26.909]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:45:27.049 --> 03:45:27.850]  We're fighting hard.
[03:45:27.930 --> 03:45:28.870]  We're winning.
[03:45:29.069 --> 03:45:30.690]  But the fight is close.
[03:45:30.829 --> 03:45:36.090]  So we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support right now at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
