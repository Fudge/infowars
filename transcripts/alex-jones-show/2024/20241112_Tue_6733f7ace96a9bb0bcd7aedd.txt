[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.920]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.700]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, November 12th, 2024.
[00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.520]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.399]  And I come to you from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting worldwide with really good news.
[00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.469]  I study the globalists in history and all the different factions.
[00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.729]  As you know, most of my waking hours, I talk to some of the best and brightest minds out there.
[00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.629]  That's who we have on as our guests, people that have the most accurate histories of being able to break down what's happening in our world.
[00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.549]  And I can tell you now...
[00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:32.090]  That the globalists, the new world order, not just here but around the planet, the BlackRock, WFUN death cult, is being completely routed and exposed and destroyed and being fed into a wood chipper,
[00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.930]  politically, feet first right now in front of us.
[00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:43.049]  Now five years in the space and time of life on this planet is like a twinkle in your eye.
[00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.439]  So there's no way they reverse this.
[00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.959]  All their crimes are coming out.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.659]  Their pedophile networks that they use to control people are all coming out.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.060]  There's nothing they can do to stop us now, other than a nuclear war.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.819]  And so we're not completely out of the woods yet, because they serve Satan.
[00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:10.680]  But God is in control, and I don't think God's going to let the planet get blown up quite yet.
[00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:28.729]  So, I am seeing signs everywhere that the Democrat Party here domestically and other leftist globalist parties around the world are in total panic mode.
[00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.319]  They are either rolling over and surrendering Or they are trying to capitulate.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.860]  And capitulate doesn't...
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.680]  People think capitulate means giving up.
[00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.199]  Capitulation, generally in its main historical use of the word, means...
[00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.199]  They give up, but they want to have a deal.
[00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.199]  They sue for peace.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.340]  And that doesn't mean we can trust them, and it doesn't mean they won't try to come back later.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:12.639]  But right now, in the war against the New World Order, if Trump delivers and puts good people in, and we're stalwart and strong and realize the war's not over, we are rapidly rolling them up.
[00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:20.949]  And this current global system could be defeated within two years.
[00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:41.750]  And again, they've got lots of false flag attacks, economic attacks, bioweapon releases, things that they believe could keep them in power, but they can't do that if they know that they've already been spotlighted and lathed With the fact that they're behind it,
[00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.750]  then they can't do that.
[00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.710]  And because we have lit them up like a Christmas tree, that they're realizing right now that any angle, any move they make, they're done.
[00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.969]  So we have them in check.
[00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.229]  They don't have any moves left.
[00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.870]  Prepare for checkmate.
[00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.129]  That's right.
[00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.199]  We're closing in on them.
[00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:05.780]  I had a thought in my mind more than 25 years ago.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.080]  I'd already been on the air a few years.
[00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.159]  And I've been studying history.
[00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.860]  I've been studying white papers and books written by the globalists.
[00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:23.860]  And the arrogant, evil, blue-blood plan they had for humanity, not believing in humanity, having absolute hate for our species...
[00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:44.949]  I just instinctively, in a gut level, in a spiritual level, but also with a historical understanding, knew, didn't think, knew for a certainty that if we just exposed their operations while they were building their tyrannical world government,
[00:04:45.149 --> 00:05:05.699]  that when they went to launch phase, out of beta phase, when they hit agenda 1, 2030, which was the year 2020, and their admitted plans going back to 1992 with the UN Summit and the battle plan for a post-industrial world and forced depopulation,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:29.629]  I knew that if we wrote books and made films and gave speeches and did shows and interviewed guests and wrote articles and reports and got other people rallied to the epic struggle that was going on, And that if people became conscious of what the social engineers were doing and the hellish prison planet they were envisioning and building,
[00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:45.129]  and I was watching them build it in front of me, I knew that when they went operational, humanity would wake up and start saying no,
[00:05:45.149 --> 00:06:15.319]  and then the tyrants would unleash the oppression And bioweapons to scare us into submission and wars and racial conflict and that that would just wake people up more and that people's instinctive need to survive and thrive and to have prosperity and to have justice would come back into the world and the generations brought up watching television and living in la-la land some of them wouldn't wake up
[00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:23.449]  but a lot of people would and even if we had a minority A large minority of people saying no to the globalist project of evil.
[00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:29.089]  We would be able to slow it down and then finally stop it.
[00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:43.050]  Now we, at this point, on Tuesday, November 12th, 2024, have been like the old-fashioned 1950s Superman.
[00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.250]  You know, he gets stronger and stronger as the archetypal fable goes on.
[00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.269]  The original Superman had to jump over buildings.
[00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.189]  He could jump in front of a locomotive but barely stop it and push him back 100 yards.
[00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:57.529]  So use that analogy.
[00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.689]  It's like the people waking up.
[00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.370]  It's like Superman.
[00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.269]  The old 1950s one.
[00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:08.089]  And he jumps in front of a locomotive that's about to drive into the town and kill a bunch of people and jump the tracks.
[00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.730]  And he jumps in front of the train and the ties are all splitting under his feet and he stops it.
[00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:27.449]  Right now, today, We have jumped in front of the train and slowed it down to almost a crawl.
[00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.490]  And on our current trajectory, in six months it'll be stopped.
[00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.250]  Now it'll still have wreckage.
[00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.310]  There'll still be all sorts of problems.
[00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.449]  The public is still decadent and satanic in many areas.
[00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:46.009]  We're not saying some utopia is going to be here.
[00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.550]  But...
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.699]  We have almost stopped it dead in its tracks, and I'm watching it slow down right now.
[00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:02.699]  And once something loses momentum like that, it doesn't start back up for a long time, even if we left it alone.
[00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.959]  And we're going to dismantle the damn thing.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.860]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:14.509]  Now, I want to be 100% clear.
[00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.810]  The globalists had all their agendas going to try to kill Trump again, which they may still do as a Hail Mary.
[00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:26.370]  But the smarter ones in their group know that'll backfire worse down the road.
[00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:28.550]  They don't want to do that if they really use their heads.
[00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:35.190]  They're handing Trump a disaster of an economy.
[00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.730]  And Edward Dowd is going to be joining us to talk about that.
[00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:46.570]  Now that the numbers have come out, they hid just how bad it was, but we didn't need mainstream media to tell us or the government to tell us.
[00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:47.769]  We could see it for ourselves.
[00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.850]  He's coming up as our first guest today.
[00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.669]  Trump's being handed a disaster, but he's got a lot of tools to fix it, or at least make it a lot better.
[00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:05.529]  We can wind down the Ukraine war very quickly and de-escalate in the South China Sea with China.
[00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:12.889]  We can control the border and find the missing children and deport the criminals.
[00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:19.730]  And they're still planning false flags to be blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.509]  They've got all that in motion.
[00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.029]  But...
[00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:45.190]  When I look at not just the body language or the public statements, but the political movements and where the money's moving and what's going on, most of the globalists and the bluebloods and the Ivy League East Coast,
[00:09:45.330 --> 00:10:00.720]  when I say East Coast, I don't mean the good people of the East Coast, the farmers and the truck drivers and the school teachers and the police officers and the shopkeepers, I mean, Harvard, Yale, people that make up the State Department, the CIA,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:14.419]  blue blood, elitist, transhumanist death cult operators who really think they're smarter than everybody, really think that they could dumb us down and make us weak with leptis ideology to domesticate us and control us.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.159]  They have hit us with everything they've got.
[00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:19.940]  They've committed massive crimes.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.960]  They've tried to demoralize us, but instead it just woke us up and pissed us off.
[00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:34.070]  And they see the awakening exploding, not just here but around the world, and globalist parties being thrown out of power.
[00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.950]  And in some cases, they're voted out, and they just refuse to leave, like the case of Germany or Austria.
[00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.309]  And now Australia, they can do one of several things.
[00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:48.090]  They can give up and roll over, and that'd be smarter for them.
[00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:55.970]  Because we'll just move on with prosperity and setting things right and understand that cornering them could get in the way of fixing things.
[00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:03.269]  So we'll let most of them scurry off into abstention, into exile, self-imposed.
[00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.129]  And if they keep pushing, they know history too and they know how humans operate.
[00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.289]  They're going to end up in Nuremberg too at the end of ropes.
[00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:13.730]  And I just hope they understand that.
[00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:14.990]  I hope all of them understand that.
[00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:16.750]  And that is certainly where we're going.
[00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.950]  So...
[00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:27.259]  The majority of them are giving up.
[00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:29.440]  They're not feigning it.
[00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.340]  It's not a feint.
[00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.740]  A lot of them won't give up.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.500]  They've got such a brainwashed horde of leftists around the world.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.139]  They're going to keep operating on long after their bosses have rolled over.
[00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:46.740]  The zombie hordes.
[00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:52.659]  So we certainly don't have a bed of roses here, but it's a lot better than where we were.
[00:11:52.759 --> 00:12:05.220]  We won't at least have government actively at war with the people, actively at war with prosperity, actively trying to brainwash and screw up our kids and connect them to a bizarre leftist cult ideology.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.980]  So the cleanup is going to take decades, even in the best case scenario.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.539]  But they are...
[00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:17.879]  Routed to a great extent.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:24.179]  Let's put the headlines up for the two different Infowars and Real Alex Jones feeds I just posted on X when we went live.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.600]  There's the Infowars headline I wrote.
[00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:27.279]  Bombshell.
[00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:32.019]  The globalists know they have been beaten and are now in the process of total capitulation.
[00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:38.299]  Trump's victory has taken the global populist political realignment into high gear.
[00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:45.759]  Alex Jones and special guests break down the latest developments and what the future holds on our current trajectories.
[00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:48.720]  Let's show the real Alex Jones headline I wrote.
[00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:51.820]  Tuesday live.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.139]  The Democrat deep state system is in collapse, complete collapse.
[00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:00.899]  I see signs everywhere that the left is in total panic mode and abandoned ship.
[00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:03.600]  Must watch, share, live broadcasts.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.480]  So that doesn't mean they're not going to try to kill Trump.
[00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:18.120]  That doesn't mean they're not going to try to stage some race riots.
[00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:23.779]  That doesn't mean they're not going to freak out and run around like chickens with their heads cut off when the deportations begin.
[00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:35.700]  That's a UN replacement migration invasion with replacement voters and a permanent underclass that the left feeds off of and takes part of their paychecks and takes part of their welfare and farms them.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.340]  So yeah, the military-age men all gotta go.
[00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:42.139]  The drug dealers, the drug gangs, the human traffickers, gotta go.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.879]  And I would suggest that that's who Trump's new deportations are.
[00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:53.720]  Tom Homan goes after first.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.059]  And they're gonna have a lot of traps built into that.
[00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:58.700]  So we're not completely out of the woods.
[00:13:58.799 --> 00:13:59.759]  We've not won yet.
[00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:03.639]  But I tell you what I really see and what I think.
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.419]  The route is accelerating.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:29.299]  If we get Trump in and keep him alive and he delivers and gets good people in and can stabilize the economy, stabilize the border, stop World War III and get Americans to stop hating each other and then goes ahead with the prosecution of Schwab,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.039]  Fauci, Gates.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.620]  You've got to prosecute Hillary.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.340]  Comey.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.580]  And then give amnesty to the minions, but you just get them out of government.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.559]  And let them know in uncertain terms.
[00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.740]  People know what Trump, that's why world leaders want to work with him.
[00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.720]  What he tells you is what's actually in his mind.
[00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:56.700]  So refreshing.
[00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:00.320]  Even if they disagree with Trump, they're like, well, at least we know what he stands for.
[00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:04.889]  So, America will be back.
[00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:06.409]  The world will be on a much better course.
[00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:22.389]  We've got a lot of serious problems that we still face, but since the Federal Reserve took over in 1913, the private banking cartel, and then 1947, the National Security Act, with the CIA being above the law, the Atlantic set,
[00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:40.720]  and that's what they call themselves, that's what they call the main CIA publication, Atlantic, the Atlantic, the Atlantic, until even the 40s, The Blue Bloods got in a real sycophantic relationship with the British and with Churchill.
[00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:49.639]  He wrote about this in his three-volume set, History of the English-Speaking Peoples, and the British Empire basically agreed to merge with the American Empire.
[00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:50.820]  This is all mainline history.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.440]  It's just the average American doesn't know about it.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.620]  And they even started affecting British accents.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.139]  That's why they call it an Atlantic accent.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.250]  And That's what America's been under really since then.
[00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:14.409]  And we are in the process of removing that group.
[00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.730]  The Rothschilds are right at the center of it.
[00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:22.070]  And they're the ones that want you poor.
[00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:23.710]  They're the ones that want you dumb.
[00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:31.769]  They're the ones, if you look at British intelligence, the British government, I mean, it's been run by pedophiles for 50 years, 100 years.
[00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:32.690]  I mean, that's mainline...
[00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.250]  British newspapers admit that.
[00:16:35.769 --> 00:16:43.009]  The MI6 basically runs giant pedophile rings that controls the government and the media, and you don't get into the high levels unless you're a pedophile.
[00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.830]  So that's what Epstein's a part of.
[00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:54.590]  Maxwell, you know, dad basically ran that with the Mossad and MI6. It's all just one big sick cult.
[00:16:55.809 --> 00:16:57.110]  And it's all coming down.
[00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.169]  The P. Diddy's just another spinoff.
[00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:02.590]  That's just a tentacle, a little tentacle of this thing.
[00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.029]  And no matter what they do or what they pull, everyone hates them.
[00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:12.029]  That has a brain.
[00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.349]  The corporate media is a joke.
[00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.230]  They now admit no one's watching or listening or believing them.
[00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:26.609]  They've got a group of cult members that shave their heads because Trump won and actually think they're all going to be put in camps and Trump's Hitler and all this is just preposterous.
[00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:36.029]  Trump is just for prosperity and doesn't want the Great Reset and to make everybody poor so that they can be put on welfare and socially engineered.
[00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:41.349]  That's what the Cloward and Piven Great Reset program is.
[00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:49.349]  And so Trump's like, no, we're not going to blow up society and make everybody poor and have crime in the streets and defund the police and just live in hell.
[00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:51.250]  And that's why I don't like him.
[00:17:52.349 --> 00:18:01.900]  Because he just wants to be the guy that turned America around and turned the world around and Everybody can go to church and raise their kids and live in safe communities and go play golf.
[00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.079]  And, you know, they see him as small-minded.
[00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:17.319]  They've got their master plan, transhumanist, global elite depopulation plan, and it's all for them in the future, led by King Charles, who wants a military global government to enforce saving the earth with depopulation.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.920]  I mean, this is a crazy death cult.
[00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.170]  And people are finally going, wow, it's really a death cult.
[00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:28.569]  Elon Musk has been exposing them now for about four years, hardcore, the last two.
[00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.250]  And people are really waking up and going, man, this is a psychotic group of control freaks.
[00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:40.230]  Well, why do you think they made the mid-1980s or early 80s Moonraker?
[00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:43.349]  You know, cheesy James Bond movie.
[00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:48.329]  Well, look it up.
[00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:51.369]  Ian Fleming wrote Moonraker in the 60s.
[00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.990]  And Ian Fleming was the deputy head of the OSS and then MI6 later.
[00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.029]  And he gave interviews.
[00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.869]  You can look them up.
[00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:15.750]  Major magazines saying, oh, these are things we talked about and heard about in different groups and I kind of just took what I really saw happening in the real world and put it into fiction books that then got turned into movies.
[00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:34.269]  Well, what happens in Moonraker is there's a global government of global billionaires, and they're going to release a bioweapon that kills everybody on the surface of the Earth to build a utopia, and then they're going to go to a space station for a year while everybody dies on Earth.
[00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.930]  And that's an allegory for what they're really doing.
[00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:47.960]  And you see it in movies like Came out a few years ago.
[00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:49.380]  Elysium.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.619]  So, that's their horrible evil plan.
[00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.900]  And we're already well into the operation phase.
[00:19:57.099 --> 00:20:01.200]  Where they say the future's not human, there's no humans by 2047.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.329]  That's official WEF. I mean, you watch their...
[00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:06.089]  We're not cherry picking.
[00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.410]  You watch their mainline global government summit and they're like, all of you will have chips.
[00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.750]  We're going to mind control you.
[00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.849]  We're going to replace your memories.
[00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:18.250]  They already have corporations where they make everybody wear a headset that reads your brainwaves while you're at work.
[00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:29.289]  I mean, this is all about seeing what they can get you to do like a giant Stanford prison experiment.
[00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:43.519]  And If you just wake up that they have bad intentions and they're evil and see through their plan instead of responding to the stimuli and their cover stories and just cut right to the chase.
[00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:44.259]  Oh, here's their plan.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.900]  They're so arrogant.
[00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:49.539]  They all wrote books about all this and why they're going to do this.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.700]  And then they're really trying to do it.
[00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:55.200]  And I know that's fabulously evil.
[00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.380]  I know it sounds crazy.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.480]  But I mean, you got Bill Gates on TED TV 16, 17 years ago saying we need to reduce the world population to zero.
[00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:09.359]  And when you really get into their literature, they don't want to just get rid of 80% of people.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.200]  That's the public number.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.059]  They talk about getting rid of all humans and only this new superhuman existing.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.119]  Where have you heard of the Uber mentioned before?
[00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:18.279]  The Nazis.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.319]  So...
[00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:24.880]  You watch the movie Moonraker...
[00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:29.890]  And they were showing earlier parts of the movie.
[00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.430]  Go to like Moonraker.
[00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.950]  Yeah, there's some of the space stuff.
[00:21:33.069 --> 00:21:36.349]  But what's really important is they have an underground base that they launch from.
[00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:41.150]  And at the underground base, there's all the beautiful, smartest people.
[00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:47.349]  And they're of all great races, colors, and creeds, but they've been chosen by the elite to repopulate the Earth.
[00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.190]  It's like Noah's Ark.
[00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:54.349]  Instead of God destroying life on the surface with water, they do it with a bio-weapon.
[00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:56.950]  So with the globalists, it's all about playing God.
[00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.950]  So I'll cover all the news.
[00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:01.769]  Huge guests.
[00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.529]  Just amazing broadcast today.
[00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.430]  Edward Dowd, Max Keiser, and more.
[00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.789]  But I'm talking about the real world.
[00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:18.730]  I keep telling you who the bad guys are, where they said it, where they did it, and I know.
[00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:26.789]  You hear this, and you're like, they're going to release a virus and lock everybody down and make you stay six feet apart and give you poison shots and destroy your immune system.
[00:22:28.009 --> 00:22:32.450]  And then give you a world ID, which is really a social credit score to control you in the name of a vaccine passport.
[00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:35.009]  And people saw me say that in 2011.
[00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:41.349]  And once they released COVID, that got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of views everywhere.
[00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:45.769]  And people will go, how the hell did he know this?
[00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.910]  Well, if you watch the report, it's all in the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep.
[00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:54.359]  And they repeat this crap over and over again.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:14.079]  I mean, I can think off the top of my head of like 50 reports from the UN and John Hopkins and the Carnegie Endowment, the CIA and the British intelligence about how they're going to use a virus to set up world government, how they're going to train you to stay in your house and telecommute with lockdowns and how that's training wheels for permanent martial law.
[00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:16.619]  I've shown it.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.700]  I've showed you the videos.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.039]  I've showed you saying it.
[00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:24.680]  And I'm just like, hey, folks, do we really want to be put in prison, basically, and then be slowly killed?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.119]  I'm like, screw you.
[00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:27.119]  I believe in people.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:41.440]  I believe we can get them out of their trance, warn folks, get leaders in academia and in culture and in government and in media to just say, no, we're not doing this.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.799]  And that's now where we're at.
[00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:52.369]  And once you know they're the bad guys, they can't carry out the next phases of this.
[00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:53.170]  Hey, go ahead.
[00:23:53.289 --> 00:23:54.190]  Release the new virus.
[00:23:56.369 --> 00:23:56.890]  Go ahead.
[00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.029]  Try to have new lockdowns.
[00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.670]  You're all going to end up at the end of a rub for sure if you do that.
[00:24:02.349 --> 00:24:03.789]  So I don't want you to do it.
[00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:05.450]  I don't want to lose my family in this war.
[00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.650]  You're not worth dying for.
[00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.390]  Okay?
[00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:10.609]  I don't dream of a war with a globalist.
[00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.190]  I don't dream of violence.
[00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:13.769]  I want you to stop.
[00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.369]  But, if you keep going, you're smart enough to know you're not going to get away with it.
[00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:20.710]  Okay?
[00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:28.910]  So, just like the cops will tell a bank robber, hey, you're just going to get 10 years in prison if you release the hostages and come out.
[00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.210]  But if you don't, we're going to kill you.
[00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.150]  So, put the gun down.
[00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:36.089]  Come out with your hands up.
[00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.289]  Give up now.
[00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:38.730]  I'll give you an hour.
[00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.970]  So, look, people know I'm not boasting.
[00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.190]  You're not boasting.
[00:24:45.509 --> 00:24:46.750]  We're not exaggerating.
[00:24:46.869 --> 00:24:49.349]  I never exaggerate anything positive.
[00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.069]  I never cheerlead stuff.
[00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:52.529]  I've always been a realist.
[00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:56.589]  Over the last 30 plus years on air, I will tell you exactly where I really think we are.
[00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:03.289]  And praise God, we are in a very good position right now because they killed Trump.
[00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.650]  They crashed the economy.
[00:25:04.829 --> 00:25:05.970]  They do a fake cyber attack.
[00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:09.750]  Anything short of nuclear war, they're done.
[00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.450]  And they're going to get dug out of their bunkers there as well.
[00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:13.150]  And they do that.
[00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.400]  They won't survive long either.
[00:25:16.539 --> 00:25:17.420]  I'll assure you.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:26.880]  The military and the people around them know it's them, and the minute that goes on, the globalists and their bunkers are going to be dealt with immediately.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.519]  And they know that too.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:35.500]  So, we're going to go to break, come back, get into all the video clips, the capitulation, all of it.
[00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:37.940]  They can't be trusted.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.380]  It's not a full capitulation.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.880]  But the route, the collapse, is so bad.
[00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:47.700]  And we're seeing capitulators everywhere and full rolling over happening.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.660]  Full surrender is going on.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.819]  I would advise that.
[00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:55.440]  And then you can help clean this up.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.539]  And we'll never trust you and turn our back on you.
[00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:01.160]  But you can...
[00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.130]  You can help if you want to.
[00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.130]  We'll pat you on the head.
[00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.930]  That's what I'd like to do instead of put you up there on the gallows and break your neck.
[00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.630]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:14.569]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's going to save this country and nothing's going to stop it.
[00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.130]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:21.950]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:22.829]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:25.130]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:26.210]  Don't tell me eating right.
[00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:26.930]  I'm not going to bite it.
[00:26:27.829 --> 00:26:30.569]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.289]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:26:35.569 --> 00:26:41.390]  I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with ultimate sea moss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:26:41.589 --> 00:26:42.329]  That's why, right here.
[00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:48.150]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:49.950]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:51.910]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[00:26:54.609 --> 00:26:58.569]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.849]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.670]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court, but we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:15.950]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:21.769]  All of us together are going to lift the curse off of this country, and we're going to send the globalists to present.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.980]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.779]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.119]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:40.160]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:41.839]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:44.960]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.640]  Listen.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.559]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:02.819]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.940]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, on this Tuesday, November 12th, 2024 transmission.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.619]  I want to go over all the good news, the signs of the enemy capitulating.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.579]  There's so much here, and we've got guest after guest today.
[00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.900]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, the wonderful congressman from Georgia.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:34.279]  We've got Edward Dowd on Trump being handed a total disaster and the numbers now coming in, more fake numbers from the Democrats and just how bad the economy is.
[00:28:35.579 --> 00:28:45.180]  But it's good to know that, good to understand that, good to have Trump get ahead of it and explain that and just tell us the facts, but that we've got policies that will stabilize it, will mitigate it.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.640]  It'll probably take him at least a year to even turn it around partially if we get behind the agenda fully.
[00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:55.650]  Also, a lot of cabinet positions are preparing to be filled.
[00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:58.329]  We're seeing some good signs there and also some bad signs.
[00:28:59.109 --> 00:29:00.650]  There's so much we're going to be going over.
[00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:16.130]  But we've not defeated the globalist deep state yet, but they are in the process of realizing that the more they push back, the more opposition they create, and reality is dawning on them, and they're openly saying all over the place that they're done.
[00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:18.430]  And that's not...
[00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:38.640]  Them playing possum from my research, they are seriously understanding that their arrogance and their horrible worldview, their disgusting elitist death cult religion,
[00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:42.769]  Could only operate if the public wasn't aware of it.
[00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:54.289]  And they've been so arrogant, they've written thousands of books that I know of, hundreds I've read, and just run around constantly acting like we're a bunch of retarded monkeys and can't figure out what they're up to.
[00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.130]  No, people were busy.
[00:29:56.369 --> 00:29:57.450]  They were selfish.
[00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.789]  They were distracted.
[00:29:59.349 --> 00:30:01.289]  There was a lot of fun stuff to do.
[00:30:01.869 --> 00:30:05.410]  And so as long as the gravy train was going, people were going to stay asleep.
[00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:09.190]  But the globalists wanted to bring in austerity.
[00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:15.309]  For social control and to bring in the sterilization and to bring in the social credit score.
[00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:21.869]  And so I knew human nature when the real squeezing started four and a half, five years ago.
[00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.450]  And I'm on record decades ago saying this.
[00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.509]  In fact, they found a new video from 1999.
[00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:30.069]  If we have time, we'll get to it.
[00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.529]  Alex Jones lays out the post-human world breakaway civilization.
[00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:41.440]  And I predict there that once they launch it, That's when the opposition would happen and we had a good chance of beating it.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.440]  Incredible.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:51.559]  Until you realize, if you just study history and the globalist and human nature, that they're really trying to sell something horrible.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:53.920]  Dystopia?
[00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:55.119]  You'll own nothing?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.079]  You'll eat bugs?
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.140]  Family's bad?
[00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:00.900]  Private property's bad?
[00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.690]  You want to cut our son's penises off?
[00:31:04.009 --> 00:31:06.009]  You want men and women's bathrooms?
[00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:10.809]  It's just all about scrambling us, destabilizing us, demoralizing us.
[00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:16.049]  And once people figure out where it's coming from, that stuff doesn't demoralize you anymore.
[00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:23.109]  It pisses you off and makes you realize what's good and worth fighting for and worth celebrating.
[00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:34.930]  It's like if you've been out cutting wood 20 below zero 100 years ago in Minnesota because you've got to have wood to heat the house and cook food.
[00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:50.950]  You've been out there for four or five hours chopping wood and you come in and your wife and your kids are sitting around the dinner table and they've just cooked a delicious meal and you take your coat off and walk over to that fire and man, isn't that fire wonderful, more beautiful than ever?
[00:31:52.069 --> 00:32:07.109]  Warming your hands, turn around, warm your back, wash your hands, sit down with your family and your children, your wife, look in her eyes, look in their eyes, dog comes over, pat it on the head, and sit down to a nice steak or some chicken and some vegetables and just,
[00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.289]  you know, think about how good life is.
[00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:16.349]  That little cottage with your wife and children and the fire is liberty and freedom and God's promise.
[00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:21.049]  And the tyranny is that freezing cold.
[00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:28.569]  But liberty and standing up for freedom and building the cultural redoubts is that little warm, safe place.
[00:32:29.009 --> 00:32:30.269]  It's worth defending.
[00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.470]  Because to not defend it is death.
[00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.029]  We're talking about civilization that starts with the family.
[00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.210]  And starts at the hearth.
[00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:40.910]  At the fireplace.
[00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:48.410]  And our hearth is the liberty and love of God and His light shining through our very cells.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.240]  And so, with all this evil, if we don't know there's good, the evil will make us give up and be demoralized.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.319]  Because we're out in the freezing cold and there's nowhere to go and we don't know there's a warm hearth.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.660]  We don't know there's a little warm cottage with delicious food cooking on the stove.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.700]  They want you to not know that's their waiting.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:16.599]  And I'm saying, here's the cottage, here's the wife, here's the husband, here's the children, here's the neighbors, here's the friends, here's the little ponies out in the barn.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.940]  Here's the stars we can look at in the nice sky.
[00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.539]  Little birdies we can watch hop around the trees.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.339]  And so that's what this is the process of.
[00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:30.140]  You want the little cottage?
[00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:32.319]  You want the wife and children?
[00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:35.440]  You want the security and the freedom and the love?
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:43.259]  Or do you want the freezing death cold of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the New World Order that Google wants to make you live under?
[00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:51.230]  So you're demoralized if you're a leftist, trapped under this control, and you think the good people are the reason you're so upset.
[00:33:51.809 --> 00:33:54.069]  No, you're upset because you bought into a death cult.
[00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:54.970]  You're under a trance.
[00:33:55.069 --> 00:33:55.730]  You're under a spell.
[00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:00.650]  And we're waiting for you to come out of the cult.
[00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:02.829]  We want to help you.
[00:34:04.529 --> 00:34:05.730]  It's warm in here.
[00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:07.589]  It's safe.
[00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:08.090]  It's good.
[00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.909]  It's who you are.
[00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.750]  Just join your humanity.
[00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.989]  And that starts with joining with God that made you.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.780]  God's waiting for you right now to make that decision and join us.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.239]  We're strong.
[00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.639]  We're good.
[00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:22.940]  We're truthful.
[00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.619]  We're honorable.
[00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:27.619]  And we just want success for ourselves and you as well.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:37.639]  You can have anything you want, but you can't do it through abuse and lies and fraud, and you can't take it away from us.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.280]  You understand that?
[00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:43.340]  I understand because you feel inferior, and you are inferior by your life choices.
[00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:51.280]  That you think, and I'm talking about globalists on the top of the system who are the lowest of all down to their minions in the street.
[00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:57.139]  You are fundamentally threatened by the wholesomeness and goodness of humanity.
[00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.480]  And that's why you try to stamp it out.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:15.650]  Because you know if the public ever finds out that God's real and that freedom's real and that security's real and that creativity's real, And that justice is real.
[00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.210]  You'll never join them.
[00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.110]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:28.409]  That said, I've been working really hard, working really late.
[00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.110]  I've been going to bed about 1 a.m.
[00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.389]  lately for the last few weeks.
[00:35:31.949 --> 00:35:32.989]  Shoot, some nights not sleeping.
[00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.670]  We're sleeping two hours on the couch or at the office like an election night.
[00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.090]  So it was about 9 o'clock.
[00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.409]  I told my wife, I said, I'm going to bed earlier.
[00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.929]  I told my daughter that.
[00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:59.360]  And I... Went in and climbed in bed, chugged a glass of ice water, and said, let me just check real Alex Jones one more time,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.159]  see what's going on there.
[00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:03.840]  And I spew out headlines so fast to the crew, it's my fault.
[00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:10.519]  The headline said, Infowars to close its doors Wednesday, Alex Jones' response.
[00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:12.280]  And I went, oh, crap.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.739]  And it already had like a half million views.
[00:36:15.699 --> 00:36:17.340]  So I wasn't going to delete it.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.780]  It was up there.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.940]  So I went and wrote another post above it and below it and said, this is a typo.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.800]  I said it could potentially get closed Wednesday.
[00:36:24.139 --> 00:36:26.260]  And I saw leftists celebrating it.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.239]  It trended the top of X. Because I didn't know it was trending.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.860]  I went, oh, let me go check what's trending.
[00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:34.380]  Oh, gosh, I'm at the top of it.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.119]  And I saw the left celebrating, so I thought, well, I better shoot a video.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.340]  And so I said, you know, I want some more water.
[00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:45.320]  And out in the garage refrigerator, I got Topo Chico.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.179]  I said, I want Topo Chico.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:53.159]  So I went out in the garage, sat out on a chair that's out there, shot a quick video, a little two-minute video.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:53.639]  Yeah.
[00:36:54.099 --> 00:37:01.300]  Alex Jones responds to stupid leftists celebrating the potential closure of Infowars.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:17.219]  And I said, this is emblematic of you guys celebrating your tyranny, celebrating your censorship, celebrating what you think is a victory.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:33.539]  When shutting this building down and this equipment down, If I don't give up, if I don't see it as a defeat, if my crew doesn't see it as a defeat, if my listeners don't see it as a defeat, will only make us bigger and stronger.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.420]  Because what Nietzsche said is true.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.159]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:51.099]  And so yes, there's a lot of weasel behavior going on with the auction tomorrow.
[00:37:52.539 --> 00:38:01.380]  That I'm not going to talk about until we see what happens, but it's, like everything in this, it's all been as crooked as the dog's back leg.
[00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.920]  And there were new developments yesterday afternoon, I was told about.
[00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:14.000]  I wasn't told to keep it secret, but I'm not even going to talk about it until it's run its course.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.719]  But...
[00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:34.000]  They need some type of victory, even if it's on the surface, and even though it's not a victory, even though it's in a Hegelian understanding or a Machiavellian understanding, anybody would tell you on its face firing Tucker Carlson from Fox was a stupid move,
[00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:35.480]  and he got exponentially bigger.
[00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:37.639]  And it'll be the same thing here.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:44.679]  We just had 10 more radio stations, big ones, in the last week or so.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.639]  Say, oh, we want the show live.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.679]  We've gained like 50 in the last few months.
[00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:52.840]  It's got to be over 400 now.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.300]  People forget about how important those old systems are.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.500]  There's still a lot of folks listening there.
[00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:01.559]  They de-platformed us everywhere six years ago.
[00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:04.480]  That's how we stayed on air and kept reaching people.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.219]  And you kept getting the clips and sharing them.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.079]  And so we weathered that storm.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.179]  But...
[00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:19.789]  This is a vestigial hangover of the Justice Department and the CIA and their law affair that came out in court they were running.
[00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.809]  But we do need to expose this.
[00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:31.050]  We do need to legally fight this because they want to continue to do it to other people.
[00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.489]  And obviously, my fight is your fight.
[00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:44.519]  And we need to stay on air, robustly, so that we can defend Trump, get him into office, Be an intel agency for him with private Humet on the ground.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.780]  Because people really listen to us.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:53.800]  They know myself and my guests and the crew and what we do is some of the best analysis and information out there.
[00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:56.199]  So I pledge to you I will continue on.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.860]  It's a hassle to build new studios.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.940]  It's a hassle to deal with all this stuff.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.880]  And it gets in the way of doing the work of exposing the globalist.
[00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.099]  But that comes with the territory.
[00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.650]  The only variable in all of this is you.
[00:40:11.289 --> 00:40:24.570]  And you're doing your job amazingly when it comes to sharing the articles and videos and the live feeds and stuff from RealAlexJones on X and Infowars.com forward slash showandman.video and if we do get shut down tomorrow...
[00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:34.139]  Obviously, we've got to propagate the news sites, and those will be built up.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:50.000]  Right now, they're just with links to the live shows and backups, and you'll see video feeds there, but then it'll be articles and reports, and everything that you have at InfoWars will be at places like AlexJones.network, RealAlexJones.com,
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.489]  AlexJones.live, Those are URLs to save.
[00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:15.000]  alexjones.live realalexjones.com alexjones.network follow us on x at ajnlive for alexjonesnetwork at ajnlive If the bad guys buy it tomorrow,
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:21.119]  I've been told by the Federal Justice Department and U.S. trustee that they've said we want it shut down immediately.
[00:41:21.739 --> 00:41:23.860]  And I said, you mean when their wire clears?
[00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:24.639]  He goes, well, no.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.420]  I mean, we believe them.
[00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:28.699]  We'll just, you know, they want you off the minute that happens.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.920]  So if bad guys get it tomorrow, we'll just continue on.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.000]  I don't know if we can shut off at 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 8 o'clock.
[00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:35.519]  I don't know.
[00:41:38.689 --> 00:41:41.449]  Because symbolically, I'm not just going to go, okay, well the bad guys got it, bye bye.
[00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.329]  We'll be here until they come here, give the order, whatever.
[00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.389]  I'll be on the air when they turn the lights off.
[00:41:47.489 --> 00:41:49.329]  Fighting the last millisecond.
[00:41:50.409 --> 00:41:51.269]  Because I'm not a quitter.
[00:41:51.769 --> 00:41:56.050]  And then I'll just drive down the road to the other studio and continue on tomorrow night.
[00:41:56.389 --> 00:42:00.369]  It may take them a few days with their bureaucracy to shut us down, so we might be here Thursday, Friday.
[00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.150]  I don't know.
[00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.030]  If good guys buy it, then we'll just continue on here.
[00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.090]  Because that's the thing.
[00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:09.909]  I don't own the Alex Jones Network.
[00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.469]  Good guys by InfoWars.
[00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.269]  I won't own it.
[00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.849]  They've got their fake rigged judgment where judges already found me guilty.
[00:42:19.269 --> 00:42:22.030]  And had the show trials literally with HBO scripting and all.
[00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:26.889]  That's why I was given a huge list of things I couldn't say like I was innocent or things like that.
[00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.869]  And she wouldn't let me talk.
[00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.869]  Then she put their people on the stand and just let them monologue at me for 30 minutes of time just saying total lies.
[00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:40.239]  Fake financial experts didn't examine any of our books.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.579]  None of it just said, oh, Alex Jones has got $360 million in the bank.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.019]  Just total horse crap.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.099]  But as I said, they were on trial at those trials.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.739]  The corporate media was on trial.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.900]  And it's stuff like that that's turned the whole world against them.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:09.960]  And it's just like the Mendez brothers and the courts and the systems covering up the dad raped both of them almost every day from the time they were babies.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.440]  And made them do the most horrible things you could ever imagine.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.980]  But in the end, what really happened and who the bad guys were came out.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.199]  Well, I don't have to wait 25 years for the truth to come out.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.179]  What was done to me.
[00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:26.130]  It's already come out.
[00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:27.309]  Almost everybody already knows it.
[00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:28.409]  The FBI's admitted it.
[00:43:28.469 --> 00:43:29.889]  The CIA got caught admitting it.
[00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.289]  I didn't do anything they said.
[00:43:31.429 --> 00:43:33.769]  They just used me to raise money for themselves and play victim.
[00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:42.469]  And most people didn't buy their BS when they were in the middle of it.
[00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.230]  But certainly almost no one does now.
[00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.449]  Because we're in the age of awakening and understanding now.
[00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:59.730]  But there's the hangover, the vestigial situation where They're going to run around like a consolation prize.
[00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:03.710]  Trump's in, we're turning the country around, trying to stop World War III, trying to find the kidnapped kids.
[00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:14.550]  And these people are going to run around like it's some victory to, quote, pay the money I owe them.
[00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.389]  They never wanted money.
[00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:16.889]  They sat on the court out of steps.
[00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:18.030]  We want him silenced.
[00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.929]  When he uses an example to silence others, yeah, that's what the bad guys do.
[00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:29.929]  So they can silence you so they can raise money off of you with fundraisers lying about what you did playing victim.
[00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:33.050]  It's beyond disgusting.
[00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.489]  So, coming up.
[00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.849]  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on the Trump transition and what the deep state's planning and how we stop them.
[00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:46.070]  Edward Dowd on the economy.
[00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.510]  Candace Owens.
[00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.389]  Oh yeah.
[00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.130]  Max Keiser.
[00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:53.639]  And more.
[00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:56.719]  Quite the broadcast for you.
[00:44:57.639 --> 00:45:01.500]  Today, and I'm going to read you the man from the arena, Teddy Roosevelt, speaking in Paris again.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:07.960]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:23.000]  The credit belongs the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the great deeds.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:38.860]  Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
[00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:45.800]  so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:56.659]  So, Most patriots, most people that fight evil, never get to see the evil they were fighting defeated in their lifetimes.
[00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:03.280]  We are getting to see evil exposed and defeated in live time right now in front of us.
[00:46:03.599 --> 00:46:15.820]  And if we don't rest on our laurels and sit on our hands and continue to expose the corruption and continue to make the right choices in our own lives and continue to expose the poison shots and the fact they're going to try another pandemic again...
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:24.519]  The globalists are in irrevocable trouble, and there's no putting their New World Order back together again.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:42.079]  All the king's horses and all the king's men, all the intelligence agencies and all the corporate media and all the think tanks and all the law firms and all the PR firms and all the globalist BlackRock, Fiat, Rothschild money can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:46:43.699 --> 00:46:46.699]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:46:47.559 --> 00:46:50.139]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:59.960]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Klaus Schwab and King Charles back together again.
[00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:02.679]  And I'll quote you another nursery rhyme.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.739]  Fee-fi-fo-fum.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.260]  I smell the blood of globalist scum.
[00:47:13.239 --> 00:47:20.179]  Be they live or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.440]  And I'll do that metaphysically in the information war.
[00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:35.079]  Be they live or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[00:47:39.789 --> 00:47:41.230]  Because we are the giant.
[00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.510]  We are the people.
[00:47:43.909 --> 00:47:45.909]  We are the destiny on this planet.
[00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:48.050]  Our roots go back into eternity.
[00:47:51.889 --> 00:47:54.449]  Oh, you didn't know eternity is forwards and backwards?
[00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.690]  There is no forwards and backwards.
[00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:03.650]  There's one timeless, eternal moment experiencing itself in the mind of God.
[00:48:05.369 --> 00:48:06.429]  An endless...
[00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.950]  Adventure.
[00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.969]  But you must join with it.
[00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:18.849]  Or you can create your own private hell.
[00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.110]  And that's what hell is, separation from God.
[00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:22.849]  I would not advise it.
[00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:28.789]  Because God wants you to create and have unlimited potential.
[00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:36.230]  But you can only have it within the perfection of God's mind.
[00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.150]  Just like a fish needs an ocean to swim in.
[00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.309]  It is part of the ocean.
[00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:46.489]  It is timeless.
[00:48:46.489 --> 00:48:47.710]  It is the ocean.
[00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.409]  And all of it, the separate parts, one.
[00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:57.829]  Total individualism, total free will, total consciousness, total collective.
[00:48:58.809 --> 00:49:04.929]  Not the false system of a directed satanic collective of slaves.
[00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:16.230]  But a compendium of free spirits within a limitless, perfect collective.
[00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:30.269]  Total, complete, endless, timeless perfection.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.260]  All right, I'm going to go to break.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.059]  It will make it really good for us to fight the New World Order at point-blank range for you and ourselves.
[00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:41.420]  If you support us, we need money.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.099]  You are the only variable in this fight.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.340]  The future of the Infowar and what I do, what the crew does, and our very important work is in your hands.
[00:49:51.519 --> 00:49:52.280]  Go now.
[00:49:54.819 --> 00:50:13.320]  We're good to go.
[00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.349]  You want this poster.
[00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.170]  And it's a fundraiser poster.
[00:50:18.489 --> 00:50:20.969]  That means we bring some real funds in on this.
[00:50:21.469 --> 00:50:22.829]  $29.99.
[00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.969]  It's a collectible.
[00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.250]  It's limited edition.
[00:50:26.469 --> 00:50:27.570]  It's got Trump's signature.
[00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.309]  It celebrates Infowars action in the fight against the globalists.
[00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.329]  Our victory together.
[00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:37.880]  There's great supplements, amazing patriot apparel.
[00:50:38.039 --> 00:50:38.699]  It's all there.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.920]  It takes money to win a war.
[00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:41.539]  Plus, you need this on your wall.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:51:01.760]  So, if you back what we're doing, and you want us to continue in the fight, go now to thealexjonesstore.com and get the historic 2024 populist victory poster with the great Donald Trump back to back to back exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:12.089 --> 00:51:15.369]  We brought in a lot of money at the AlexJonesStore.com through our sponsor.
[00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.610]  And they're great guys.
[00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:17.349]  They're great marketers.
[00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:17.849]  They're bigly.
[00:51:17.969 --> 00:51:22.369]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Steven Crowder and the Hodge twins and so many others.
[00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.710]  I had little talks with them though because I see the numbers.
[00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:29.190]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:32.710]  And then you give VIP members another discount?
[00:51:32.949 --> 00:51:34.030]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.750]  Oh, actually, some of these deals we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[00:51:37.869 --> 00:51:38.289]  They're going to love it.
[00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.769]  I'm like...
[00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:45.829]  Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually, you know, get 20-something bucks.
[00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:48.289]  You know, after all the cost.
[00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:50.170]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:52.070]  So, I had an idea two weeks ago.
[00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.369]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[00:51:54.929 --> 00:52:03.309]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide, 2024, my signature.
[00:52:04.419 --> 00:52:04.739]  Historic.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.559]  Looks great in your office.
[00:52:05.719 --> 00:52:06.239]  Great wherever.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.219]  You know you support us.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.300]  Whatever happens to InfoWars that survives is even cooler.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.059]  Doesn't survive.
[00:52:10.179 --> 00:52:10.780]  You've got the memento.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.579]  It helps fund the future.
[00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.349]  An Alex Jones-style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[00:52:15.489 --> 00:52:19.829]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[00:52:20.289 --> 00:52:21.070]  It's right there.
[00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:23.389]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.409]  They're limited edition.
[00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:29.150]  This is literally you knowing you back the second American Revolution at such a critical time.
[00:52:29.269 --> 00:52:32.650]  While we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:38.289]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality and they're on like a poster boards.
[00:52:38.449 --> 00:52:39.090]  They're thick.
[00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:39.550]  They're nice.
[00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:40.809]  It's like a particularly good movie poster.
[00:52:42.469 --> 00:52:46.429]  And then the tube and all that's like six, seven bucks, eight bucks per unit.
[00:52:46.989 --> 00:52:55.309]  With 50 bucks, you know, we're getting like, you know, they get part of their operations, but we're getting 20-something bucks for each poster for the operation.
[00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:03.909]  So if folks just go buy the posters, if people buy them right now, you'll hear me when I come back on Sunday and Monday, I won't be up here, please, please help me, help me, help me.
[00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.949]  If you go get those, we'll have the money and some runway out a few months.
[00:53:09.659 --> 00:53:10.500]  But the legal, everything else.
[00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:13.400]  So if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point.
[00:53:14.639 --> 00:53:22.199]  TheAlexJonesStore.com And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:32.800]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for 25, 30 bucks, and the t-shirt costs $15, or it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.179]  Not a lot of money.
[00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.920]  So these are the things you get If you really want to support us.
[00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:41.840]  And all the Trump years in, it's amazing.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.440]  Trump won.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.179]  These are the best designs out there.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.179]  I'm proud of these guys.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.579]  I love the work they're doing.
[00:53:47.539 --> 00:53:49.179]  And it's all there.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.019]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, three limited edition posters.
[00:53:53.619 --> 00:53:55.400]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.280]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[00:53:57.619 --> 00:54:00.239]  And they're simple and they're very strong, very clean.
[00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:02.960]  It's my original design for the InfoWars logo.
[00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:05.679]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:12.219]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody like if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.780]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.099]  But if I did, that'd be hanging in my house.
[00:54:18.159 --> 00:54:18.579]  That's fun.
[00:54:19.719 --> 00:54:21.500]  And so it's all there.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.719]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.000]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.300]  I want to thank God for leading, guiding, directing.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:27.699]  It's been incredible.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.159]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me because...
[00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:32.800]  They understand, but I've been a jerk lately.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.340]  I'll admit it.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.159]  I try to repent.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.579]  I try to not be so angry, but this is our whole future.
[00:54:36.699 --> 00:54:37.780]  If they get it, they're pissed off too.
[00:54:38.219 --> 00:54:46.559]  They've been busting their ass, and I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[00:54:46.659 --> 00:54:51.079]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years, and they're a badass team, so I salute them.
[00:54:51.199 --> 00:54:58.760]  So for all of us here at the Infowars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan, but God works through you, so take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.000]  Get the posters now.
[00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:06.079]  Seven days ago, Trump, with a massive landslide, overrode the fraud.
[00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:07.559]  They clearly stole some Senate seats.
[00:55:07.699 --> 00:55:08.420]  We'll go with that later.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.039]  And some House seats.
[00:55:10.179 --> 00:55:12.000]  But the Republicans clenched the House last night.
[00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:14.480]  She's obviously super popular.
[00:55:14.699 --> 00:55:15.820]  Talk show host, very busy.
[00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:17.460]  Such a wonderful lady.
[00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:19.840]  Candace Owens is with us for 30 minutes.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.420]  And Marjorie Taylor Greene and others today.
[00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:23.059]  Candace...
[00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:24.809]  This is a little short five-minute segment.
[00:55:24.949 --> 00:55:27.510]  We join 400-plus radio stations coming up in the next segment.
[00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:32.429]  But just out of the gates, when I get you, I don't even need to ask for talking points.
[00:55:32.449 --> 00:55:34.670]  I just always want to hear what you're covering now.
[00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:36.130]  What's your takeaway?
[00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:38.210]  Are you positive about it?
[00:55:38.409 --> 00:55:39.769]  Will the deep state strike back?
[00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:41.190]  Candice, thank you so much for being with us.
[00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:44.809]  Lots to say, and thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:55:44.909 --> 00:55:48.349]  It's nice to be back where it all began, one of the first people that had me on your show.
[00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:50.349]  I think it was PJW, and then I did your show.
[00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.230]  But look, everyone very excited last week.
[00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:54.090]  We should be excited.
[00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:54.869]  It was a major win.
[00:55:54.969 --> 00:55:55.949]  It was too big to rig.
[00:55:56.090 --> 00:56:06.230]  I think it provided even further evidence that 2020 was rigged, for those who are not too big of cowards to openly admit that because they're so scared of being called a conspiracy theorist or an insurrectionist.
[00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.530]  I've maintained that.
[00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:08.389]  2020 was stolen.
[00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:09.349]  They used COVID to do it.
[00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:13.010]  Now, you know, the first part of the sprint was just getting Trump into the office.
[00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.269]  We obviously understood that he is the man for the job.
[00:56:15.409 --> 00:56:15.969]  He's been resilient.
[00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.469]  He survived assassination attempts.
[00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:26.190]  And I think now what it is is about holding basically everyone around him accountable, their feet to the fire, and making sure that there is not an infiltration.
[00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.670]  And that is a major concern right now that there are people around him that have infiltrated.
[00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:36.130]  And the biggest example of that, of course, is the fact that Mike Pompeo's name was even being floated at all.
[00:56:36.409 --> 00:56:38.250]  Nikki Haley's name was even being floated at all.
[00:56:38.539 --> 00:56:51.699]  I had it on very good authority, and I'm not gonna name names here, but there were basically neocons, the war hawks, the people that love to send Americans over to die overseas, especially if they're Southern Americans.
[00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:58.960]  They love to send Southern men over to die overseas because they're probably the last shred of masculinity that we have in this country.
[00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:03.829]  And they are hellbent on this war with Iran.
[00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:09.710]  And so the concern was that he was going to put people in his cabinet that are these war hawks.
[00:57:09.869 --> 00:57:11.630]  And so I want to know.
[00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:12.530]  Yes, it's great.
[00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.730]  Trump tweets that Mike Pompeo.
[00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:16.510]  Thank you, Nikki Haley, for your service.
[00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:17.510]  Thank you, Mike Pompeo.
[00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:18.610]  You will not be in the new administration.
[00:57:18.909 --> 00:57:23.030]  But what's important is who was in his ear that even suggested it?
[00:57:23.269 --> 00:57:24.630]  That person also has to go.
[00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.349]  Right?
[00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:56.329]  All we have to do is flatter Trump and tell him that if he does this, he's gonna be perceived as amazing, and they feel that because they came in at the end with money, that Trump will do as they say.
[00:57:56.469 --> 00:57:57.349]  Now, I don't believe that.
[00:57:57.429 --> 00:58:02.050]  I know Trump is his own man, and I think that's going to give them trouble, is Trump is an alpha.
[00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:04.849]  He's not gonna sit around and be bossed around by a bunch of people.
[00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:12.510]  But of course, this is a major concern for us, and we're still happy, we're still celebrating, but now we have to make sure that these cabinet picks are correct.
[00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:16.969]  I absolutely agree with you.
[00:58:17.909 --> 00:58:22.110]  And it was good that he did get rid of Haley and Pompeo.
[00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:30.650]  And I talked to folks that talked to Trump, one of the ones that showed him the video, Pompeo, celebrating the Mar-a-Lago raid and saying Trump's basically guilty.
[00:58:30.949 --> 00:58:32.530]  Trump did not even know about that.
[00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.849]  Yeah.
[00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:37.449]  People who think Trump, he is very smart, he's a great guy, but he doesn't know a lot of stuff.
[00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:38.670]  He's 78 years old.
[00:58:38.929 --> 00:58:40.349]  He misses a lot of things.
[00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:42.909]  And it's really up to us, the new media.
[00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:44.929]  We're not the alternative.
[00:58:44.929 --> 00:58:47.989]  We are the media to spotlight these cockroaches.
[00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:51.369]  What do you think of talk of Rubio being the Secretary of State?
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:52.960]  It's a nonsense.
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:56.059]  Obviously, Rubio should not be the Secretary of State for the same reasons.
[00:58:56.219 --> 00:59:01.300]  And if you want further proof of that, go look at Trump's old tweets about how Rubio was bought and paid for.
[00:59:01.519 --> 00:59:10.719]  And so again, a lot of what happens in my understanding, and I've seen this in person, is that he's got a bunch of people around him that print out articles and show him, oh, this is what's in the news say about this.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.239]  And he trusts these people, of course, because they're in his inner circle.
[00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:17.269]  But if they're only showing him A certain version of articles.
[00:59:17.269 --> 00:59:19.230]  They're very much controlling what he sees.
[00:59:19.429 --> 00:59:22.969]  So if Mike Pompeo says something nasty about him, they simply just won't show him.
[00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:28.829]  The Mike Pompeo article or the tweet or whatever it was that he said, the video, that is him saying something nasty.
[00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:34.809]  So we need to make sure that Trump is having daily conversations with people that we know are undoubtedly American first.
[00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.969]  Canada, stay right there.
[00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:36.969]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:37.590]  Stay with us.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:51.239]  Well, one of the smartest people out there in the populist global awakening is the great talk show host, Candace Owens, longtime friend, and was one of the first to interview her many years ago.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.500]  That's a whole story how the left was...
[00:59:55.849 --> 01:00:02.269]  We're good to go.
[01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:13.829]  Of that gaslighting.
[01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:26.849]  But if you just joined us, a lot of stations just joined us at the 6th after, she was getting into what's front and center, getting Trump in in 68 days, and then making sure his cabinet and other positions don't get filled with globalists.
[01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:38.170]  And she said earlier, if you just joined us, and I wanted to recap that, that the fact that Pompeo was even considered, the fact that Trump last week had him in a rally saying nice things, and then I got the clip to Roger.
[01:00:38.429 --> 01:00:39.369]  He didn't know about it.
[01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.849]  He got it to Tulsi.
[01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:41.769]  She showed it to him.
[01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:42.869]  Roger talked to Tulsi.
[01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:47.190]  You know, Roger's at Marlog all the time too, but he's really good friends with Tulsi.
[01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.949]  They talk every day.
[01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:51.469]  And she went in, showed Trump, and he got pissed.
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.769]  And then we found five or six other clips, got them to her.
[01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.429]  And that's just how this works.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:02.199]  But it's scary because Trump, you know, only watches this and that, and he misses this with Pompeo on TV saying, yeah, Trump's guilty.
[01:01:02.539 --> 01:01:06.480]  You know, he shouldn't have had these secret documents, which, of course, the president legally and lawfully can.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.119]  And so he's going to go to prison.
[01:01:08.239 --> 01:01:08.760]  Ha ha ha.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.019]  I mean, it was so simple to get that to Trump, but nobody else was going to do it.
[01:01:13.139 --> 01:01:20.840]  Because a lot of the politicos, even when Trump got in in 2016, knew there were bad people around him, but they didn't want to expose it because they didn't want to get kicked out of the White House.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.039]  But they still got kicked out anyways.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.559]  So this is a real fight.
[01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:25.679]  So I don't tell that story and go, look how important I am.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.579]  I got the information to Roger.
[01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:29.679]  He told the story a few days ago here on air, and then he got it to Trump.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.840]  That's ridiculous that I'm having to do that.
[01:01:33.179 --> 01:01:34.559]  Social candidates, that goes to your point.
[01:01:35.819 --> 01:01:36.679]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:41.480]  And so this is a major concern, and it's something that we need to make sure we're loud about, that we get these things trending.
[01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:44.659]  We made a lot of noise about Mike Pompeo, but he's not the only one.
[01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:48.960]  And like I said, whoever floated his name is obviously still within close proximity to Trump.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.199]  At least we know that we have allies in Eric and Don, and they're going to have their father's ear.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.119]  And Don, at least, was very vocally against Mike Pompeo on Instagram and those things.
[01:01:59.559 --> 01:02:01.739]  But I mean, Marco Rubio, what is this?
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.059]  What are we even talking about?
[01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:07.110]  Trump is magnanimous.
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:13.070]  He does want to bring people in and say, okay, I forgive you for what you may have thought about me in the past, because that's what he should do.
[01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.809]  He should be forgiving.
[01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:21.230]  But he can't be so forgiving that he doesn't realize that his forgiveness is being used as a strategy to infiltrate, because that's exactly what's happening right now.
[01:02:21.329 --> 01:02:25.789]  They go, okay, well, they now are saying behind closed doors that all we have to do is flatter him.
[01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:30.570]  So they look at what they did in 2016, 2018, leading up, and they attacked Trump.
[01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.210]  They attacked Trump.
[01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:34.489]  They literally tried to help get Hillary Clinton elected.
[01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.110]  Think about that.
[01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:39.469]  Hillary Clinton, Benghazi, Hillary Clinton, they tried to get her in office.
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.289]  They started the Never Trump movement, you know, the neocons.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:44.449]  We will never, Trump will never accept this.
[01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:51.710]  They had no reason other than the fact that, well, they wanted Hillary Clinton because she's a war hawk and she's a part of the establishment and she's a part of the deep state.
[01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:58.210]  And when that failed, they then took a step back, re-evaluated and said, what's the best thing for us to do?
[01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:06.889]  Well, at I think they determined at the very end when Trump somehow then fought through and now he's at the top of the Republican nominee ticket.
[01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.210]  Okay, what we're gonna do is we're gonna have to try a different strategy.
[01:03:09.329 --> 01:03:11.650]  We're gonna pretend that we're on his side, right?
[01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.070]  We're gonna pretend that we're on his side.
[01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:14.409]  We're gonna give money to him.
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.690]  We're gonna tell him how great he is.
[01:03:15.769 --> 01:03:16.369]  We're gonna flatter him.
[01:03:16.469 --> 01:03:17.869]  We're gonna get into his innermost circle.
[01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:24.289]  And then we are going to suggest that he put this person to this place or that person to the other place.
[01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:25.789]  This is an infiltration.
[01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:27.730]  These neocons hate you.
[01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:28.730]  Trump needs to hear this.
[01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:31.440]  Neocons absolutely hate you.
[01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:32.619]  I can attest to that.
[01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:38.760]  It pains them that you are in a position of power, but they view you as weak in terms of wanting to be liked.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.440]  And so that is the hole that they see.
[01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:43.280]  And like I said, we have to continue to speak out loud about this.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.750]  There's tons of people who I still believe Our blackmail, the majority of our congressmen are blackmail.
[01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:49.329]  I think you and I both understand that.
[01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:54.449]  We are seeing over and over again these blackmail operations that keep getting exposed.
[01:03:54.449 --> 01:04:04.690]  So when you wonder why you have congressmen voting a certain way, when you wonder why you have congressmen sending billions to Ukraine despite the fact that it is unfavorable with the American people, you are looking at people that are blackmail.
[01:04:04.809 --> 01:04:05.989]  There's no question about it.
[01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:08.730]  You're totally right.
[01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:11.110]  So you're issuing an emergency warning to Trump.
[01:04:11.469 --> 01:04:12.550]  You're dead on.
[01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:16.309]  Rubio's been kissing his ass for years now, but did stab him in the back.
[01:04:16.469 --> 01:04:17.829]  So has Lindsey Graham.
[01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.949]  And Rubio's obviously blackmailed, and we know the whole history of why.
[01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:24.909]  And I'm not saying he's not smart.
[01:04:24.909 --> 01:04:26.469]  I'm not saying he's not a good speaker.
[01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:29.630]  I'm not saying he hasn't been a big Trump booster for at least two years.
[01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.650]  But these are the people that tried to put Trump in prison.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.360]  These are the people, at the end of the day, the neocons run the Democrat Party's foreign policy.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.860]  They're the ones that want World War III. They're the ones that tried to get Trump killed twice.
[01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:45.440]  This is a life and death situation, so this is the hill to die on.
[01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:50.219]  We cannot let these people get into the administration.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:57.559]  And the media is basically saying that Rubio is expected to be the Secretary of State.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.239]  This is not good.
[01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:08.980]  I'm hopeful that Charlie Kirk's tweet when he just wrote out last night, hey, don't listen to anything if it doesn't come directly from Trump's mouth, is a signal that maybe that's not going to be the circumstance.
[01:05:09.159 --> 01:05:16.079]  And I'm hoping that he is now seeing the reaction, or at least someone who is a good guy on the inside is seeing the reaction, is going to communicate to him in the short run.
[01:05:16.219 --> 01:05:21.340]  But the reality is a lot of these people, they perform this way, like I said, because they're cowards and they're blackmailed.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.940]  And I have an entire theory about how it's all sex blackmail.
[01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:26.789]  When you think of Lindsey Graham, I mean, there's no question.
[01:05:26.909 --> 01:05:29.630]  When you live in D.C., you hear the rumors that are swirling.
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:39.829]  I lived in D.C. for the first four Trump years, and you just imagine that they have a very sophisticated blackmail ring where they have people approaching them, and they're following their phones, whatever it is.
[01:05:39.909 --> 01:05:51.869]  That's why I say to men, stop watching pornography, by the way, because I am convinced that they're tracking your IP addresses, they're seeing what you're into, and they're just building entire profiles on people on the basis of what they're clicking online.
[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:53.389]  I very much believe this.
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:57.590]  100% and Crossfire Hurricane and all of it.
[01:05:57.869 --> 01:06:00.849]  And again, this is life and death for not just Trump, but for America.
[01:06:01.409 --> 01:06:04.889]  If he lets any of these people in, they will leak lies.
[01:06:05.409 --> 01:06:07.309]  They will testify against Trump.
[01:06:07.449 --> 01:06:08.429]  They will derail.
[01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.730]  They will sabotage.
[01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:14.409]  He absolutely must not let any of these foxes in the henhouse.
[01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:15.829]  Right.
[01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:16.190]  Absolutely.
[01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:19.469]  And so that's what we're looking for, is we've got to really pay attention to these cabinet picks.
[01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:20.210]  We have to be bold.
[01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:21.469]  We are the new media now.
[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:25.590]  Obviously, this election, the results have proven this, that nobody's listening to these old guys anymore.
[01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:26.829]  Nobody believes these goons.
[01:06:26.929 --> 01:06:32.650]  And so we just have to be bold in our assessments and calling out these congressmen and not caring about how the mainstream media reports on it.
[01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:49.869]  I mean, the election is not over in Trump has won the election, but until we have all of those cabinet seats confirmed and we know that these are actual fighters, people that are not going to be fearful if they're being blackmailed behind the scene or I guess reporting to somebody else behind the scenes because they don't want their business to come up.
[01:06:50.949 --> 01:06:52.670]  We need to make sure that that happens.
[01:06:52.670 --> 01:07:00.010]  And when all of those picks are done and we have America First people, I will be able to breathe a sigh of relief.
[01:07:01.329 --> 01:07:01.730]  Absolutely.
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:03.130]  But here's a microcosm.
[01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.449]  The head of the private federal reserve said he's not going to work with Trump.
[01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:06.789]  Trump can't fire him last week.
[01:07:06.949 --> 01:07:09.869]  That really exposes how unconstitutional and a fraud it is.
[01:07:09.969 --> 01:07:10.630]  It claims it's government.
[01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:11.070]  It's not.
[01:07:11.449 --> 01:07:15.969]  Trump comes out and says he's going to cap credit card interest rates at 10%.
[01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:18.690]  That's trillions of dollars for the globalists right there.
[01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:21.610]  And this will supercharge the economy.
[01:07:21.849 --> 01:07:23.489]  It's not just sex blackmail.
[01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.429]  They pay these people off.
[01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:27.050]  They give them huge bribes.
[01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.849]  They give their family giant jobs.
[01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:39.869]  And so when Trump's doing this for the people, because it's the right thing to do, there is going to be billions of dollars of payoffs moving around to try to block him from doing this.
[01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:44.210]  So that's why Trump has to have an iron wall of good people in there.
[01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.429]  And he's got to go on the offense and destabilize the deep state further.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.000]  I am seeing a lot of signs of capitulation everywhere.
[01:07:50.119 --> 01:07:50.480]  Look at this.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.900]  Top DC national security lawyers, Mark Zaid saying, give up, flee the country.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.579]  You know, we're never coming back.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:05.420]  MSNBC audience told to listen to Joe Rogan, have discourse on X, says the dinosaur media is dead, using my term.
[01:08:05.659 --> 01:08:07.760]  Now they go on and say, everyone's turning against us.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.579]  We have no audience.
[01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:09.559]  Everyone hates us.
[01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:12.400]  They use the term, you know, the mainstream media is dead.
[01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:15.059]  So there's also some realizations here.
[01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:20.210]  FBI Director Christopher Wray is preparing for possible forced exit under Trump.
[01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:23.630]  And we're also talking about Kash Patel as the CIA Director.
[01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:25.449]  We're also seeing a lot of good signs.
[01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.409]  How would you describe where the globalists are?
[01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.609]  Because I would describe it as collapsing.
[01:08:30.949 --> 01:08:38.149]  And now if Trump just forces through the objective, that's called pressing the attack, and just goes in there like a steamroller, they're done.
[01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:43.810]  But if he gives them any toeholds or makes any weak moves, then this is going to be a disaster.
[01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.890]  Right.
[01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:46.130]  He cannot give them one inch.
[01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:46.750]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:47.550]  There are good signs.
[01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:48.229]  They are fearful.
[01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:50.149]  You can see that in what they're writing.
[01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.949]  Now they're suddenly interviewing and covering the podcasting space.
[01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:55.609]  And they're trying, I would say, almost to be warmer.
[01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:59.069]  I've had three features in Vanity Fair over the last week.
[01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:02.949]  And they really spent such a long time attacking me and saying awful things about me.
[01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.569]  But now they're realizing, who are you writing to?
[01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:06.609]  You're writing to yourselves, just like Jeff Bezos said.
[01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.890]  Essentially an echo chamber.
[01:09:07.989 --> 01:09:08.810]  The people have moved away.
[01:09:08.909 --> 01:09:09.689]  They know you're lying.
[01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:11.449]  And so they're moving on.
[01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:21.939]  And Some things have been alarming, like they're basically saying they need to get a stranglehold in the podcasting space, they need to get a stranglehold on free media, and that Congress should be passing laws against misinformation.
[01:09:21.939 --> 01:09:27.239]  I mean, totally crazy, wacky stuff because they realize that they can no longer persuade the people.
[01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.520]  I mean, you even heard Joy Behar.
[01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:47.010]  The wacky witches on The View were saying this day after election, they were saying essentially that they needed more censorship, that the people that voted for Trump were simply miseducated, right, or uneducated rather, and that they needed to make sure that they were taught what news to listen to and what news not to listen to in the school system.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.539]  Now you have Trump saying he's gonna blow up the Department of Education.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:55.380]  Well, that's great because that has been a propagandist effort since its inception in the 1970s under Jim Carter.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.819]  This was done by feminists, aka communists, that came over from Russia and began the feminist movement in America.
[01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:07.439]  And they instantly got to work wanting to implement the Department of Education because it's like Soviet training.
[01:10:07.659 --> 01:10:10.779]  This is why you have all of these kids outside crying, these little Marxists.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.659]  They're Marxist education camps.
[01:10:12.869 --> 01:10:22.109]  So as soon as he starts making these sorts of threats, by the way, I want to say, and I don't believe they're a threat to believe he's making these promises, his life is in danger because people are desperate, right?
[01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:24.170]  So they want World War III. They want war with Iran.
[01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.090]  That writing's been on the wall for three years, okay?
[01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:39.180]  They love their Department of Education because it's their Marxist training camps under the guise of teaching kids We're good to go.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.779]  We're good to go.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.840]  They are right now fighting the hardest because they are an animal backed into the corner.
[01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.060]  An animal that is backed into the corner fights the hardest.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.859]  They're fighting the hardest because they're losing, right?
[01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:20.380]  They are absolutely desperate.
[01:11:20.659 --> 01:11:21.979]  No one believes them anymore.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.760]  People actually want change.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:33.279]  So these next couple of months are going to be important, but I also want to make sure that we keep Trump safe as we are heading towards Inauguration Day.
[01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:34.550]  I totally agree.
[01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:43.649]  And if you look at the big tax-free foundations in England and the US that set up the current world government system, places like Europe and Australia are three or four years ahead of us.
[01:11:43.689 --> 01:11:45.970]  So you look at that, you have a time machine in the future.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.439]  Australia has a new law they're trying to pass that will make literally the government the sole arbiter of truth.
[01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:54.479]  Anyone that they say is a liar will be arrested.
[01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:58.880]  It allows the government to pose as patriots online and set people up.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.460]  This is desperation.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.079]  The EU is doing the same thing.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.119]  Germany's moving to ban the AFD populist party because it's taking over.
[01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:10.119]  But long term, that will just defeat them even faster.
[01:12:10.319 --> 01:12:32.090]  So a lot of desperate tactics out of the globalists, not out of strength, We're good to go.
[01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:48.890]  The U.S. government, if Trump is in charge and uses the sticks he's got and the carrots, we can defeat all these other globalist-controlled countries very, very quickly because globalism was run out of the United States.
[01:12:49.029 --> 01:12:58.569]  So this is really seizing control of the control room of the new world order, and we have to be honest about that and go to soft power and say the bad guys aren't We're not in control anymore.
[01:12:58.729 --> 01:13:03.930]  We're going to promote freedom and justice and prosperity and open free markets and the family.
[01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.609]  And all these countries are signaling.
[01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:13.069]  Russia, China, everybody's ready to come to the table because humanity's sick of war, sick of lies.
[01:13:13.449 --> 01:13:15.930]  The globalist project, the death cult's been repudiated.
[01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:18.050]  And there's an exponential awakening.
[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.130]  So I agree with you that we're on the bubble right now.
[01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.550]  Anything is possible, but we have to understand we've not won yet, Candace.
[01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:27.569]  Yeah, no, that's absolutely true.
[01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:37.630]  And it's so funny that you mentioned Australia because I got banned from Australia a couple of weeks ago, unilaterally banned from one person, one minister who said I had the power to ban her before I had even applied for my visa.
[01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:38.569]  He said, I'm going to ban her.
[01:13:38.949 --> 01:13:41.029]  And we're talking about I've never been in trouble.
[01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.890]  I've traveled the world.
[01:13:42.029 --> 01:13:43.149]  I mean, I was in Japan last week.
[01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:48.930]  I've been UK back and forth, France, Italy, you name it, Israel and never been in trouble.
[01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:49.689]  But he banned me.
[01:13:49.789 --> 01:13:49.930]  Why?
[01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:54.390]  We're good to go.
[01:13:55.149 --> 01:14:09.010]  We're good to go.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.039]  And they basically said, we're going to ban Canna Stone.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:13.420]  It's not him.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.699]  He's allowed to be on tour in Australia.
[01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:16.260]  I think his dates are actually this month.
[01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:17.420]  And they banned me.
[01:14:17.539 --> 01:14:18.699]  And now we're fighting this.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:23.680]  But I imagine that had Trump had won, Tony Burke maybe would not have done something like that.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.140]  He may have thought twice about that.
[01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:29.420]  Because now with Trump in office, you're gonna start banning American citizens for speech.
[01:14:29.579 --> 01:14:31.359]  Okay, well, we're gonna see how that plays.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.300]  Now it's gonna be a different game for Australia.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.779]  And so we feel like we have a strong case.
[01:14:34.899 --> 01:14:35.300]  We're in court.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:39.220]  We've bumped those Australian dates to first quarter of next year.
[01:14:39.529 --> 01:14:42.970]  And so I'm still planning on going on tour, going through this appeal, this appellate process.
[01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:44.210]  But it is shocking.
[01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:56.270]  It is shocking that someone who has never committed a crime, who has spoken all over the world and has never sown discord can get unilaterally banned by just one person who said, I'm going to do it.
[01:14:56.369 --> 01:14:59.369]  Or I even applied for a visa and signed off on it right away.
[01:14:59.569 --> 01:15:04.630]  Because according to him, there's a potential that I could sow discord in Australia.
[01:15:04.789 --> 01:15:05.789]  What does that really mean?
[01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:06.949]  They're controlling speech.
[01:15:07.329 --> 01:15:12.649]  Just three months ago, Australian senators were calling for Musk to be criminally charged or arrested.
[01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:13.390]  They backed down.
[01:15:14.289 --> 01:15:21.989]  Then that corrupt judge down in Brazil started seizing other companies like Starlink.
[01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.590]  And so Musk had to back off there.
[01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.289]  Then the EU said, oh, look, that worked.
[01:15:26.449 --> 01:15:28.770]  We'll start seizing his companies as well.
[01:15:28.949 --> 01:15:29.649]  People say...
[01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:31.449]  Okay, well, who cares about Elon Musk?
[01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:34.689]  Well, I do, because he's been a champion and a game changer now for Liberty.
[01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:36.729]  And if they can get him, they can get anybody.
[01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:42.470]  And this is a global social credit score system where they can ban Candace Owens from Australia.
[01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:44.310]  Next, it'll be getting on an airplane here in America.
[01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:46.750]  That's Larry Fink at BlackRock's own statement.
[01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:51.810]  We're going to use the ESG corporate structure to make them enforce social credit score on the public.
[01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:53.329]  And that's the control grid.
[01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.109]  That's the star of the crown of tyranny.
[01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.729]  That's what has to be exposed.
[01:15:57.770 --> 01:16:00.149]  Yeah, that is literally a social credit score.
[01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:01.789]  And it was incredible to see his reasons.
[01:16:01.869 --> 01:16:05.069]  He just was basically citing CNN articles.
[01:16:05.869 --> 01:16:12.689]  Okay, so by that logic, every single person in America who's voted for Trump is banned because we're apparently a bunch of Nazis and Hitler supporters.
[01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:13.649]  And they're like, this is the evidence.
[01:16:13.789 --> 01:16:14.489]  CNN wrote this.
[01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:19.470]  And so, yeah, it's alarming, but it is also very promising because The Australians are outraged.
[01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:20.750]  I mean, positively outraged.
[01:16:20.829 --> 01:16:32.470]  And so many people wrote me and said this really was the huge wake-up call for how much power the government really has because they said when they did it to Novak Djokovic during the COVID lockdowns, their excuse they used was health.
[01:16:32.609 --> 01:16:34.250]  What is their reason for banning me?
[01:16:34.449 --> 01:16:36.350]  You can't pretend there's any issue.
[01:16:36.449 --> 01:16:37.430]  You know there's no threat.
[01:16:37.569 --> 01:16:40.510]  I mean, a Catholic mom of three is not a threat to your country.
[01:16:40.789 --> 01:16:43.989]  And so you are starting to see people really begin to fight back.
[01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:49.989]  And I think that makes them incredibly fearful when they see people vote in the way that we did and the numbers that we did for Donald Trump.
[01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:51.069]  It makes them incredibly fearful.
[01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:54.289]  And they're trying now the strategy of containment, basically.
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:59.260]  Let's just try to keep the Americans separate, and what we're going to have to do is speed up our tyranny.
[01:16:59.399 --> 01:17:06.399]  Actually, I just got an email this morning, and Alex, I don't know if you've done any work looking into the Emmanuel Macron thing, but I'm telling you he is fully married to a dude.
[01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:07.859]  I don't care what you call me.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:14.119]  It's a dude who molested him when he was a kid, by the way, because they have this 40-year age down.
[01:17:14.119 --> 01:17:14.720]  That's on record.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.319]  He was 14 having sex with him.
[01:17:17.539 --> 01:17:18.340]  Yes, exactly.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.239]  And that part they never even speak about, because they have to admit that.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:27.060]  I mean, they have them in yearbooks, they know their ages, and so the press just ignores that piece, and it's at best statutory rape.
[01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:32.180]  Well, I've seen his husband give speeches, and I mean, it's a dude in a wagon.
[01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:35.319]  He walks around like a rooster, like a man, yells at people.
[01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:36.829]  I mean, it's a dude.
[01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:47.590]  Really scary stuff, but now the journalist that broke that story actually emailed me this morning and said that essentially what they're trying to do is put pressure to bankrupt him for a totally different regard.
[01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.149]  They're not suing him for defamation.
[01:17:49.149 --> 01:18:05.739]  They've never sued the publication for defamation, but they're trying to squeeze people in other ways to make sure that they can say, you wrote three years ago, I'm not kidding this journalist, you wrote three years ago an article Naming everybody who has power in France and these people happen to be Jewish.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.659]  So we're coming after you for laws against anti-Semitism.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:18.380]  I mean, wacky stuff because they're just trying to get this journalist to shut up because he's actually suing them for the information to prove that Jean-Michel Trogneau became Brigitte Macron.
[01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:35.409]  This desperation that we're talking about and the other countries realizing that they have this short window of opportunity to pass these speech laws to make sure that they can quite literally come after you for anything, hatred, racism, anti-Semitism, whatever it is, is a sign of their desperation.
[01:18:35.729 --> 01:18:36.670]  Candace, we're almost out of time.
[01:18:36.789 --> 01:18:37.369]  You've only got 30 minutes.
[01:18:37.489 --> 01:18:38.350]  Please join us again soon.
[01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:39.529]  I can't wait to do your show.
[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:41.609]  Let me just raise this point.
[01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:49.310]  Trump has a responsibility constitutionally to deport the military-age men, the gangsters, the human traffickers, the drug dealers.
[01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:50.789]  He's put a great guy in.
[01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:52.710]  His borders are Tom Homan.
[01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:57.390]  That said, the left is planning to make this Hitler.
[01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:58.770]  They're planning to misrepresent it.
[01:18:59.319 --> 01:19:01.500]  And I think we've got millions of military-aged men.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.060]  We've got all these drug dealers and criminals.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.760]  I think Trump should really focus on them first.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.500]  That will unify everybody behind it.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:19.100]  And then women and children that were brought up here by the left that were told to come here by Biden, a lot of them in sex traffic, case by case, Some of them are kidnapped, so they need to be brought back to their country.
[01:19:19.159 --> 01:19:22.399]  They can stay where they're from, but they should be monetarily helped some as well.
[01:19:22.779 --> 01:19:35.159]  And I think Trump has a real chance here to be the hero with everybody and not walk into the trap the left has set, because I'm hearing a lot of talk about Let's just go wild and grab everybody pell-mell.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.199]  Well, there's such a big job up front.
[01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:40.939]  They need to start with the military-age men and the drug dealers, the human traffickers.
[01:19:41.119 --> 01:19:51.600]  And Trump needs to go further and not just say there's 325,000 missing kids and sex slavery and slave labor, but say we're going to find the kids and we're going to prosecute the NGOs that were part of it.
[01:19:51.699 --> 01:19:54.340]  That's the right thing to do, and it will devastate the left.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.699]  Roll up Mayorkas, all of them.
[01:19:56.739 --> 01:19:58.500]  I think that's where he hits the deep state first.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:58.979]  What do you think?
[01:19:59.939 --> 01:20:00.699]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:08.600]  And I think we're going to be speaking a lot more in the next couple of years about human sex trafficking as people didn't realize how complex and how real that problem was.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.739]  And people are finally starting to speak about that and realizing that way too many kids go missing.
[01:20:13.079 --> 01:20:13.520]  Absolutely.
[01:20:13.779 --> 01:20:15.000]  I mean, defend our borders.
[01:20:15.199 --> 01:20:22.520]  I want to actually see troops being sent down in massive numbers as if we are fighting a war because we are.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.380]  We are fighting a war at our borders.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.539]  I'm so sick of hearing that.
[01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:27.439]  We're sending people over.
[01:20:27.939 --> 01:20:30.220]  Afghanistan, Israel, Ukraine.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.439]  Send our troops.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.300]  We are spending our tax dollars, not so that we can defend everybody else's borders, but just that we can defend ours.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:44.260]  And until that is done, until that priority is made, the American people are rightful to be upset and to recognize that we have sold out to countries that are overseas.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.840]  So that's the first thing he's got to do.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.680]  And Homan is definitely the right guy for the job.
[01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:53.149]  I know you're already doing this, but you have a huge audience.
[01:20:53.989 --> 01:20:55.750]  I've gotten Rogers to talk to Trump about it.
[01:20:56.529 --> 01:20:58.210]  It's the right thing to do to find the kids.
[01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:03.010]  And as a political weapon, we know they disappeared their records.
[01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:05.229]  We know they stopped the DNA testing four years ago.
[01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:10.130]  We know they've delivered in the middle of the night to fields and parking lots and everywhere else.
[01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.689]  This is a real political weapon.
[01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:20.529]  We have serious, mass, villainous, evil crime that will bring down the Democratic Party and what they've done the last four years.
[01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:21.989]  So this is the weapon.
[01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.989]  I mean, do you agree with me that this is the weapon Trump needs to use?
[01:21:25.829 --> 01:21:26.270]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:30.489]  And like I said, we've never seen the conversation being fostered more than before.
[01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:33.989]  And I mean, even me, years ago, I was like, why are people saying talk about human sex trafficking?
[01:21:34.069 --> 01:21:35.289]  This can't be that big of a problem.
[01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:39.409]  And then you realize, no, this is an organized crime and a crime unit.
[01:21:39.449 --> 01:21:51.989]  And we absolutely need to make sure that these criminals are found and taken and held to account and broadcast so that people understand just how evil these people have become trying to pass laws to make sure that we can't get a handle on this problem.
[01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:53.010]  It's incredible.
[01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:54.090]  They didn't just lose kids.
[01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.689]  They ran it.
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:55.189]  They brought them here.
[01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.869]  They covered it up.
[01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.350]  Real Candice O on X, her own show every day.
[01:21:58.449 --> 01:21:59.630]  Be sure and watch it and listen to it.
[01:21:59.989 --> 01:22:00.890]  Candice, thanks for the time.
[01:22:01.029 --> 01:22:01.710]  Talk to you soon.
[01:22:02.609 --> 01:22:03.130]  Thank you.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.359]  We love you.
[01:22:04.539 --> 01:22:15.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:18.840]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:29.579]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.420]  You got it right here.
[01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:33.210]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.909]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:36.409]  It's not just a detox.
[01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:39.710]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.029]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:22:41.369 --> 01:22:45.449]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:48.390]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:50.609]  And it goes on and on.
[01:22:50.829 --> 01:22:52.329]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:22:52.489 --> 01:22:53.449]  They're concentrated.
[01:22:53.649 --> 01:22:54.550]  They're incredible.
[01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:59.989]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30 and 50% off.
[01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:03.390]  50% off if you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[01:23:04.289 --> 01:23:12.250]  All right, we're going to look at what Trump's being handed in the economy with Edward Dowd, who is a super smart cookie.
[01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:19.270]  He's an ex-Wall Street professional, HSBC, Donaldson, Lufkin, BlackRock, you name it.
[01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:24.550]  He also worked on Wall Street to sell, buy side, expert in fixed income equities, capital markets.
[01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:32.529]  He's currently battling the new world order on Twitter at DowdWord and on Gatter and many other places.
[01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:33.970]  It's hard to not see him.
[01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:34.729]  He's all over the place.
[01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.390]  We'll be talking to him about the election.
[01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:39.390]  What he thinks the deep state's going to pull.
[01:23:39.569 --> 01:23:41.529]  I see a lot of signs of capitulation on the surface.
[01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:42.449]  What does that really mean?
[01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:44.590]  We'll be talking to him in a moment.
[01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:46.510]  Here's the headline.
[01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:49.989]  They just got handed fraudulent books.
[01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.670]  Ed Dowd confirms our warning that Trump is inheriting a turd of an economy.
[01:23:54.319 --> 01:23:55.239]  That's from Zero Hedge.
[01:23:55.359 --> 01:23:56.359]  We'll be talking to him in a moment.
[01:23:56.579 --> 01:24:00.319]  But first, the day of reckoning is here for InfoWars.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:16.680]  The left, it's still trending the top of X, knows that there's a secret sealed auction tomorrow, and that the bad guys have pledged to buy the equipment, the name InfoWars, the website, and shut this historic building.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.079]  We've been in this building almost 16 years.
[01:24:18.199 --> 01:24:19.060]  We've been on there 30 years.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.699]  Set up the website InfoWars in 97.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.479]  So, regardless, obviously, I'm Infowars.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.359]  The crew's Infowars.
[01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:30.560]  The audience is Infowars.
[01:24:30.659 --> 01:24:32.680]  The Infowar is a term for information war.
[01:24:33.939 --> 01:24:36.000]  We will still continue to be the Infowar.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.800]  And I don't want to say I have a bad feeling about tomorrow.
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.659]  I'm not going to tell you what I've learned in the last 24 hours.
[01:24:46.979 --> 01:24:49.979]  But this whole thing's been rigged the whole time, so why would this be any different?
[01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:54.670]  I will tell you what happened, whether the good guys get it or not.
[01:24:55.329 --> 01:24:56.890]  It's pretty spectacular.
[01:24:57.369 --> 01:25:16.029]  But so was the former federal trustee that the judge fired June 14th without a court order in May ordering a private security firm To come in here on a Friday night and close the building.
[01:25:16.649 --> 01:25:20.350]  And I figured it out when more security was showing up and said, what's happening?
[01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:23.090]  They use a security firm I've been using for eight years before that.
[01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:27.029]  It's private, you know, armed security, but I mean, it's a company that does business other places.
[01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.649]  They're just security people.
[01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:31.529]  I said, you better call your bosses and I want to see a court order.
[01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.250]  And they said, yeah, this doesn't make sense.
[01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:36.970]  And talked to their boss and they said, yeah, I keep being told, I'm the U.S. trustee.
[01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:38.350]  I'm a federal officer.
[01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:40.170]  You will close that building tonight.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.579]  And I said, okay, they're getting ready to kill Trump.
[01:25:42.779 --> 01:25:43.659]  See, I don't think about myself.
[01:25:43.659 --> 01:25:45.260]  I think, what is this?
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.260]  And I came on air that night and I said, they're getting ready to assassinate Trump.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.720]  They don't want me on air when they do this.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.319]  This is clear.
[01:25:50.659 --> 01:25:52.079]  They're about to go to martial law.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.479]  Civil unrest.
[01:25:53.739 --> 01:25:55.039]  We just instantly knew what it was.
[01:25:55.119 --> 01:25:56.859]  And of course, we saw what happened soon after.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.939]  So we've held on this long.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.800]  And we have a fair auction.
[01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:05.060]  There's some really big good guys, you know, out there.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:05.840]  And...
[01:26:07.359 --> 01:26:08.319]  They're ready to come in.
[01:26:09.359 --> 01:26:11.539]  And then yesterday...
[01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:20.270]  I've not even been asked, and I'll tell you this, but just in my own reasoning, I'm going to wait.
[01:26:20.989 --> 01:26:21.789]  I'm going to wait.
[01:26:22.689 --> 01:26:26.170]  But it's unbelievable.
[01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:31.430]  So, currently, I think bad guys will get it tomorrow.
[01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:41.750]  And with pleasure, like Ursula getting the Little Mermaid's voice, there's going to be a little devil dance, and they're going to turn the lights out here.
[01:26:41.949 --> 01:26:42.750]  Now, there's a backup.
[01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:51.489]  All that's happening and If we had more funds, we could do a better job of it.
[01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:56.289]  We're finishing a bigger studio right now, and there's legal and a lot of things, but we're going to keep kicking ass.
[01:26:56.409 --> 01:27:01.630]  It's so critical we stay on the air while he's president-elect, and once he's president, to spotlight bad guys, get them out of the administration.
[01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:08.489]  That's one of the main things they sourced going after me in 2016, 17, 18, was the fact that I was telling Trump it was bad as administration.
[01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:12.949]  Not because people didn't know, they didn't want to get kicked out by the bad guys because they outnumbered the good guys.
[01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:15.109]  So this is a real fight right now.
[01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:17.210]  Not just talking to the public, but what we do behind the scenes.
[01:27:17.369 --> 01:27:18.529]  So I'll continue on.
[01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:23.069]  But this is a bellwether for everybody else, so I need your word of mouth.
[01:27:23.069 --> 01:27:23.810]  I need your prayer.
[01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:29.909]  I need you at the Alex Jones Network, and they're trying to take real Alex Jones away, but that's failed in court.
[01:27:29.949 --> 01:27:32.390]  The judge said no a few weeks ago, so they filed new stuff to take it.
[01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:35.149]  I've got to battle that in another federal court.
[01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:37.729]  I don't tell you all this stuff because I'm not that important.
[01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:50.220]  The broadcast is what we do, but if I... They admit that part of frustrating us and trying to block us is getting me to spend all my time just defending the platform instead of using the platform for what it's designed to do.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.399]  So the point is, we're actually winning in court.
[01:27:53.399 --> 01:27:54.659]  We got a bunch of actions.
[01:27:54.939 --> 01:27:58.460]  We filed a bunch of counter stuff on lawsuits three weeks ago.
[01:27:58.859 --> 01:28:02.939]  You've seen none of it in the news because it's devastating to them and they don't know what to do.
[01:28:03.819 --> 01:28:12.010]  So the money you give us by buying great products you need We'll support Trump, support America, accelerate the awakening, and keep us on air.
[01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:13.829]  And we'll go to the fight.
[01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:14.550]  All right?
[01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:16.890]  So I need you to go to the Alex Jones store.com.
[01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:17.890]  Plus, you want these products.
[01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:27.029]  We have a new limited edition poster that I came up with the idea, but the folks, it's over the top beautiful.
[01:28:28.029 --> 01:28:29.750]  It's what I predicted for the election.
[01:28:29.869 --> 01:28:34.270]  They'd try to steal it and fail with a landslide that he won three victories back to back to back.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.279]  And that gets us some funds in here.
[01:28:37.439 --> 01:28:38.500]  It's limited edition.
[01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.470]  $29.95.
[01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:44.689]  There's also the best supplements you're going to find, like the Ultimate Seamoss.

[01:29:38.739 --> 01:29:39.680]  Time to take action.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.399]  Your decision whether to keep us on air or not.
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.359]  We're defending you.
[01:29:42.479 --> 01:29:44.979]  You're defending yourself by support.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.840]  So that's your choice.
[01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:47.979]  Fight, fight, fight.
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:49.579]  We gave Trump a lot of money.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.439]  He got the lawyers.
[01:29:50.579 --> 01:29:51.500]  They blocked a lot of the fraud.
[01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.779]  We won because you took action.
[01:29:53.899 --> 01:29:54.619]  You spoke out.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.079]  You donated money.
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:56.819]  You prayed.
[01:29:57.619 --> 01:30:00.840]  You wore t-shirts to spread the word, to normalize, taking America back.
[01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:01.859]  It's all a war.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.579]  And the fight continues now.
[01:30:03.739 --> 01:30:10.239]  There's nowhere other than supporting Trump that you can support financially and have a bigger effect than what we're doing.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.359]  I need your help now.
[01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:15.779]  And any extra help that's come in just gets rolled into InfoWars if we survive.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.600]  But I am literally facing the biggest challenge ever right now.
[01:30:19.739 --> 01:30:20.920]  This is the time for action.
[01:30:21.119 --> 01:30:22.739]  I want to commend those that have taken action.
[01:30:22.979 --> 01:30:24.840]  Those that have taken action, I should take action again.
[01:30:24.859 --> 01:30:25.659]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.260]  And I ask those that sit on the fence.
[01:30:27.399 --> 01:30:28.260]  Be part of history.
[01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:29.420]  Be the man and woman in the arena.
[01:30:29.739 --> 01:30:31.140]  Go to thealexjohnstore.com right now.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.619]  All right, Edward Dowd, I'm going to shut up.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:41.560]  We've only got 20 minutes with you to break down the election, what you see coming, and what's really happening in the economy, the biggest challenges to America and Trump, and what you think we should do.
[01:30:41.659 --> 01:30:43.000]  Edward Dowd, thank you so much.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:44.619]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.840]  Great to be here the day before the event.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.659]  And I just want everyone to pray for Infowars, Alex and his team.
[01:30:52.579 --> 01:30:56.479]  We hope that everything turns out okay and you're able to continue on.
[01:30:57.050 --> 01:31:10.470]  Look, I've been talking about the financial economy for the last two years, and we've seen what I would call the most unprecedented cooking of the books ever.
[01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:13.170]  Non-farm payroll numbers have been padded.
[01:31:13.289 --> 01:31:14.810]  They revised them down in August.
[01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:16.970]  Those numbers are lies.
[01:31:17.529 --> 01:31:21.189]  The real economy is in tatters, and how do we know that?
[01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:25.130]  Real wage growth was minus 2% heading into this election.
[01:31:25.789 --> 01:31:34.869]  And if you look at a real wage growth over time, the last time that happened, the last few times it happened, we swept in new presidents.
[01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:42.369]  Ronald Reagan in 1980, And Bill Clinton in 1992, where James Carville famously said, it's the economy, stupid.
[01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:47.649]  So I said on a couple of shows prior to the election, what do you think?
[01:31:47.789 --> 01:31:48.329]  Who's going to win?
[01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:49.609]  I said, Trump's already won.
[01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:55.369]  The question is, can it be too big to rig?
[01:31:55.569 --> 01:32:05.750]  And it turned out that Bobby Kennedy, Elon, Marcel, Tucker, Joe Rogan, everybody, and Tulsi Gabbard, and all these people that came over and made it too big to rig.
[01:32:05.869 --> 01:32:08.930]  But he was going to win anyways, but I think that put us over the top.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:19.479]  And now we're faced with, unfortunately, a turd of an economy, the reality of which is probably going to start to manifest over the next 12 months.
[01:32:19.779 --> 01:32:25.579]  It seems to me the establishment is going to turn on the economy.
[01:32:25.979 --> 01:32:31.779]  You know, obviously the last 12 months mainstream media has been selling a phony story in the real world.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.069]  The stock market is Not an indicator of the economy.
[01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:36.489]  It's a bubble.
[01:32:36.729 --> 01:32:38.329]  The asset bubble's been blown.
[01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:42.789]  And I fear that it's going to start to manifest in a downturn soon enough.
[01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:59.850]  Over the weekend, it came to my knowledge that the New York Fed I think we're good to go.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:11.239]  And it's a problem.
[01:33:11.439 --> 01:33:14.340]  And magically, I think it's going to become a problem under Trump.
[01:33:14.779 --> 01:33:18.939]  And it's going to cause some consternation in the financial markets.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.619]  Warren Buffett has already told you what he thinks.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.859]  He's amassed the largest amount of cash in his history, over $300 billion.
[01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:29.640]  He owns 4% of the TiVo market, more than the Fed.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.899]  And he's selling Bank of America's stock faster than you can shake a stick at.
[01:33:34.279 --> 01:33:39.460]  So, unfortunately, the GDP numbers are probably bogus, too.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:45.840]  The real economy, we've never seen such a disparity between reported numbers and real economic indicators.
[01:33:46.279 --> 01:33:48.319]  The real employment situation is bad.
[01:33:48.899 --> 01:33:50.920]  Real wage growth is bad.
[01:33:51.279 --> 01:33:58.640]  There's all sorts of indications of slowing down in the real estate market and a pause in investing.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.579]  The good news is Trump's in there and his policies can mitigate some of this.
[01:34:03.939 --> 01:34:06.199]  But I don't think the pain can be avoided.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:12.079]  So he needs to get in there, deregulate as quick as possible, spark animal spirits.
[01:34:12.399 --> 01:34:15.039]  So I'm not as bearish as I was.
[01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:17.960]  If Harris had gotten in there, it would have been a total wipeout.
[01:34:18.199 --> 01:34:20.579]  But there's still going to be some turbulence.
[01:34:20.859 --> 01:34:26.520]  And the mainstream media is going to turn on Trump and all of a sudden discover economic problems everywhere.
[01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:39.689]  Do you agree with me that Trump needs to get out ahead of this, not to hurt the economy, but to be honest with people and to say that's why I've got to have the Senate confirm my people.
[01:34:40.029 --> 01:34:42.470]  I've got to get the energy prices down quickly.
[01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:46.489]  We've got to cut the taxes for working class people.
[01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:48.170]  No tax on tips.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.979]  We're good to go.
[01:34:56.439 --> 01:35:00.659]  We're good to go.
[01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:03.590]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:35:03.670 --> 01:35:13.069]  He needs to get out in front of this narrative and be honest with the American people that what he inherited and what he has to do, and there's going to be some tough times ahead.
[01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:14.310]  There already are tough times.
[01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:15.189]  Let's make no mistake.
[01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.710]  The average person is struggling.
[01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:23.189]  But the mainstream media is going to instill fear in everybody and try to make it seem like it's all his fault.
[01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:25.569]  Government spending needs to come down.
[01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:26.810]  We need to take care of the deficit.
[01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:30.210]  But the only game in town the last year has been government spending.
[01:35:30.449 --> 01:35:42.449]  So as they and Elon and others tackle government spending, it will cause a contraction in the GDP. But that needs to be done because we need to free up that capital for the private sector.
[01:35:42.829 --> 01:35:47.189]  I heard Elon float the idea that all these people he fires, he gives them two years severance.
[01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:54.789]  Now, that sounds excessive, but that would help these, you know, mostly useless people transition to the private sector if they can.
[01:35:54.810 --> 01:36:01.130]  But it would at least not throw people out on the street and cause economic turmoil.
[01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:04.029]  But there needs to be solutions immediately.
[01:36:04.029 --> 01:36:04.409]  Sure, sure.
[01:36:04.609 --> 01:36:10.289]  I mean, that itself would be a stimulus for people that don't really study economics.
[01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:11.109]  Please continue.
[01:36:11.939 --> 01:36:15.739]  Yeah, so Trump needs to get out in front of this.
[01:36:15.939 --> 01:36:22.460]  I think the proposed Treasury Secretary Besant is already starting to get out in front of this.
[01:36:22.579 --> 01:36:23.539]  He's been on the war room.
[01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:24.979]  I think Steve Bannon knows him.
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.300]  My friends on Wall Street seem to like him.
[01:36:29.039 --> 01:36:35.779]  The consternation is that he worked for Soros, but not everybody that works for Soros is necessarily a bad person.
[01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:38.670]  So let's put a pin in that for now.
[01:36:38.829 --> 01:36:43.050]  At least he's not, you know, Mnuchin, who was a Skull and Bones member.
[01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:51.829]  So let's give Trump some grace on his new Treasury Secretary and not jump at him because he worked with Soros.
[01:36:51.909 --> 01:36:53.470]  That doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[01:36:53.649 --> 01:36:55.770]  He's been saying all the right things for a while.
[01:36:56.250 --> 01:37:00.029]  I'm glad you explained that because Soros is involved in everything.
[01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:08.510]  So Trump has to walk a fine line where he needs to drain traitorous neocons, leftist globalists that have proven they're going to block him.
[01:37:08.710 --> 01:37:19.329]  But there's no separation when you come to the financial world from heavy hitters that haven't been involved with heavy hitters because everything is invested in everything.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.840]  Yeah, everybody knows everybody.
[01:37:22.079 --> 01:37:26.579]  And look, I worked at BlackRock 10 years ago, but here I am.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.960]  So you need people from inside the beast to come forward.
[01:37:31.319 --> 01:37:34.500]  And Besant seems to be saying all the right things.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.159]  And again, he's got a plan that seems to make more sense.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.739]  He's already pointed out that Treasury Secretary Yellen is the worst Treasury Secretary we've ever had.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.920]  She's done basically third-world election financing.
[01:37:48.159 --> 01:38:03.180]  She basically front-loaded everything in the front end of the financing of the government in T-bills to stimulate the economy and spend like a drunken sailor, creating 750,000 government jobs in September.
[01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:07.659]  He's going to go in there and try to fix what she is wrong.
[01:38:07.659 --> 01:38:15.140]  That's what Trump pointed out is the green new jobs he'll just boondoggle the globalist companies like Gates and all of them.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.119]  Just not sucking that out of the public and then putting it into a black hole, that's going to generate a lot of jobs.
[01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:37.550]  Yeah, so the trick here is to stimulate animal spirits as fast as possible, generate excitement in the private sector, and have the economic downturn be as shallow as possible.
[01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:44.829]  It's going to be tough sledding because of what's been going on behind the curtain with the financial plumbing.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:59.300]  You've got to remember last year we had bank failures, super quick, fast, and the Fed did what's called the Bank Term Funding Program, and they plugged the hole for the time being, but they ended that program in March.
[01:38:59.619 --> 01:39:07.680]  And that was due to interest rate risk and relatively safe securities like treasuries being underwater due to the Fed raising interest rates from zero to five and a half.
[01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:14.029]  Now we're entering the part of the cycle where there's credit deterioration, like in commercial real estate loans.
[01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:16.390]  The Fed is going to have to make a choice.
[01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:20.329]  Are they going to bail these banks out again and be owners of commercial real estate?
[01:39:20.630 --> 01:39:24.810]  Or are we going to see losses and regional bank failures?
[01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:30.029]  That's the trick, and it's going to be very difficult to navigate, in my humble opinion.
[01:39:32.609 --> 01:39:34.229]  Big picture, Edward Dowd.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:46.119]  I went on air today, and I've been warning they'll try to kill Trump again, and warning they'll try to stage racial false flags, and they've said they want armed uprisings.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:40:00.819]  I mean, clearly that's one of their hopes, but I'm seeing more and more The globalists and their minions and their tacticians basically signal from corporate media to banking to the intelligence agencies that while the whole world hates us, there's a global political realignment.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.779]  Anything bad we do, we're going to get blamed for.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.420]  We can't just create crises and pose us as saviors anymore.
[01:40:06.939 --> 01:40:08.260]  What are we going to do?
[01:40:08.699 --> 01:40:11.699]  And so they're having a debate about, do they join with us?
[01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:12.699]  Do they roll over?
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.159]  I'm not talking about the top...
[01:40:14.690 --> 01:40:20.569]  We're bad guys, but a lot of their minions that are just mercenaries are kind of looking around right now saying, what do we do?
[01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.590]  Is Trump really going to come after us?
[01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:24.090]  Or how do we stop him?
[01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:25.310]  Or how do we roll over?
[01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:26.270]  Do we run?
[01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:38.409]  I'm seeing not even so much capitulation, but just disarray, panic, disorganization, which is the best thing in a war to have your enemy at that point.
[01:40:40.539 --> 01:40:41.739]  We have the initiative.
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.720]  I mean, obviously a bad economy globally being inherited, but populists being elected everywhere.
[01:40:45.859 --> 01:40:50.500]  Germany's trying to ban the populist part that's taking over.
[01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:51.539]  That's going to backfire.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:56.100]  Obviously, even in the short term, I think there's a real revolution happening in Australia.
[01:40:56.279 --> 01:40:57.340]  I mean, we see it everywhere.
[01:40:58.319 --> 01:41:00.720]  Are you positive like I am overall?
[01:41:01.159 --> 01:41:07.939]  We just gauge the public mind because I see the awakening going from explosive to just hyper drive right now.
[01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:13.529]  I don't know how you quantify what that means though.
[01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:15.869]  Yeah, so I agree with you.
[01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.350]  The Overton window is certainly here.
[01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:20.529]  The quickening is accelerating.
[01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:23.090]  More and more people are figuring out what's going on.
[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:25.369]  There's still a lot of cognitive dissonance though.
[01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:30.640]  Unfortunately, There's a huge population in our country that's been psychologically damaged.
[01:41:31.199 --> 01:41:35.420]  And, you know, we're seeing all these people go on social media screaming.
[01:41:35.859 --> 01:41:37.680]  You know, there was a murder, I think, in New York.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.199]  Oh, a bunch of murders.
[01:41:40.439 --> 01:41:42.000]  No, no, women are killing their husbands with...
[01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:43.350]  Hatchets.
[01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:47.930]  A Seattle woman overwhelmed by election-killed father with ice axe.
[01:41:48.369 --> 01:41:53.609]  You've got this guy killing his ex-wife and kids because it was better than living under Trump.
[01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:56.050]  The suicide numbers are huge.
[01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:57.409]  The left's going insane.
[01:41:58.229 --> 01:42:01.569]  Yeah, so their biggest asset are these brainwashed people.
[01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:11.649]  And if they can figure out a way to trigger them into some sort of kinetic energy before the inauguration, that's something we have to worry about.
[01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:17.229]  We also have to worry about them starting World War III before the inauguration.
[01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:20.010]  I'm worried about what's going on in Ukraine.
[01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:22.529]  I'm worried about what's going on with China and Taiwan.
[01:42:23.159 --> 01:42:25.340]  And of course, the Middle East conflict and Iran.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:34.420]  So we got a lot of, you know, things that could explode onto the scene and distract us in the next, what is it, 70 days, whatever it is.
[01:42:35.119 --> 01:42:42.100]  So this is, again, I think I came on your show and said, you know, This is the most dangerous time in the history of our country.
[01:42:42.199 --> 01:42:42.840]  It still is.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.699]  We won a battle, not the war.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:49.279]  And we need to be very smart and get out in front of the narratives.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.279]  It's a narrative war at the end of the day.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:53.119]  They still have the mainstream media.
[01:42:53.119 --> 01:42:55.100]  They still have a brainwashed population.
[01:42:56.899 --> 01:43:02.680]  The awakening is occurring, but there's still a large number of people who have no idea what's been going on.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.500]  No, I totally agree.
[01:43:03.579 --> 01:43:05.279]  But are the technocrats the different...
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.140]  Special interest.
[01:43:07.539 --> 01:43:10.720]  The different factions that gang up on us, but still are different factions.
[01:43:11.479 --> 01:43:17.939]  I can look at this and integrate all the different data points and say, they need to just kind of play possum, try to sneak back later into power.
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:18.840]  I'm not advising them.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:22.020]  But I mean, that's their only option, and that's not going to work either.
[01:43:22.399 --> 01:43:28.380]  But forcing a conflict now is going to end up in real Nuremberg 2 stuff.
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:34.460]  I mean, we can clearly see if they keep pushing, that the gloves are going to be off, and everything's going to blow up in their face.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.880]  And I'd rather...
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:42.600]  You know, not see them swinging from the end of robes and have them just go away or roll over than them press their operations.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.560]  I mean, I just don't see how they win long term.
[01:43:44.899 --> 01:43:46.680]  All I'm saying is how do we get them to capitulate?
[01:43:47.399 --> 01:43:49.699]  Well, we're already seeing some of it.
[01:43:49.899 --> 01:43:52.960]  You know, Zuckerberg is, you know, asked for forgiveness.
[01:43:53.359 --> 01:43:58.720]  Bezos is telling the Washington Post to, you know, realign their business model.
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:04.739]  And, you know, look, billionaires are billionaires, and when they sense a trend change, they'll hop on board.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.439]  They don't have any loyalty to anything.
[01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:10.180]  So a lot of these oligarchs are switching already.
[01:44:10.479 --> 01:44:11.439]  That's good news.
[01:44:11.439 --> 01:44:19.779]  But, you know, we have the deep bureaucratic state, the bureaucracy that's like ticks, blood-filled ticks in the bureaucracy.
[01:44:19.779 --> 01:44:21.899]  Yeah, they're the real problem, and they feel insulated.
[01:44:21.899 --> 01:44:23.579]  They feel protected because they act in the dark.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.300]  That's why Trump has to purge them.
[01:44:26.039 --> 01:44:26.359]  Right.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.079]  The senior executive service is the first thing that needs to be tackled.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:36.039]  These are the kind of the ruling elite of the bureaucrats that are protected.
[01:44:36.199 --> 01:44:41.960]  They're above G15 and they, you know, a lot of these holdovers from the Obama administration are still there.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:48.800]  Look at Fauci getting 15 million a year for security illegally and secretly with no congressional approval.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.760]  I mean, it's just, yeah, they are the royalty.
[01:44:50.899 --> 01:44:51.539]  This is disgusting.
[01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:52.479]  Yeah.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.500]  Well, let's talk about that for a second.
[01:44:54.659 --> 01:44:56.880]  I saw that $15 million yesterday.
[01:44:57.659 --> 01:45:01.920]  And, you know, Bobby Kennedy had to pay out of his own pocket from the campaign.
[01:45:01.979 --> 01:45:03.680]  He could have used that $15 million.
[01:45:03.819 --> 01:45:05.800]  That might have been a different campaign for him.
[01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:10.899]  This is the kind of disgusting misappropriation of funds that we see.
[01:45:11.039 --> 01:45:14.760]  And they are ticks, and they control a lot of the money and the budgets.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.560]  And, of course, we have the CIA black budget.
[01:45:17.899 --> 01:45:23.539]  You know, that we all know exists, and we don't know where that money's going and what it's funding.
[01:45:24.699 --> 01:45:27.300]  What do you think of Kash Patel, CIA director?
[01:45:28.659 --> 01:45:29.859]  I saw that yesterday.
[01:45:29.859 --> 01:45:30.800]  I think he'd be great.
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:38.760]  I mean, he knows how the game is played, and he seems to be for team humanity, so I'm all for it.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.899]  I mean, the guy, you know, when I watch him speak, I believe him.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.079]  He seems authentic to me.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.260]  Edward, thank you so much for the time.
[01:45:48.279 --> 01:45:50.140]  I really appreciate you.
[01:45:50.399 --> 01:45:52.119]  And like you said, it's an info war.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:52.920]  It's what it's all about.
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.960]  And whether we get shut down tomorrow or not, we'll be talking again soon.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.079]  Thank you so much.
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.319]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:58.439 --> 01:45:58.760]  Take care.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:45:59.920]  There he goes.
[01:46:00.319 --> 01:46:00.859]  All right.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:04.579]  We got Max Keiser, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and more coming up.
[01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:08.439]  And I cannot express enough to the listeners and viewers.
[01:46:08.579 --> 01:46:09.859]  You're the reason we're having the success.
[01:46:10.939 --> 01:46:13.199]  You're the reason Trump got elected despite the fraud.
[01:46:13.539 --> 01:46:15.140]  You're the reason we have the initiative.
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:16.060]  That means we're winning.
[01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:16.880]  We've turned the tide.
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:18.140]  We're routing the enemy.
[01:46:18.899 --> 01:46:27.300]  But if we don't continue to fight as hard as we can in the info war, this could get really nasty.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.060]  So in the info war, I think there's a place we want to keep on air, and that's this operation.
[01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:34.390]  And it takes money to do that.
[01:46:34.869 --> 01:46:36.189]  So we sell you great products.
[01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:38.770]  We want to have a relationship with you so you like them and you want to get them again.
[01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:40.069]  I need funds.

[01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:22.590]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:26.550]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.

[01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:44.670]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[01:48:44.789 --> 01:48:48.270]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:50.010]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:52.800]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[01:48:53.119 --> 01:48:58.079]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[01:48:58.279 --> 01:48:59.300]  You're in the know.
[01:48:59.659 --> 01:49:01.560]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.739]  Free shipping.
[01:49:02.739 --> 01:49:05.920]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:07.340]  It just goes on from there.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:14.439]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Orders at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.760]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.640]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.380]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:24.779]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:32.810]  yellowshowstore.com It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:42.130]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:49:42.329 --> 01:49:49.390]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:51.529]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:54.489]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:55.729]  We've already...
[01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:57.670]  Just devastated them.
[01:49:57.810 --> 01:50:00.850]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:50:01.069 --> 01:50:02.409]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:50:02.909 --> 01:50:03.989]  They're super dangerous.
[01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:06.689]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:14.210]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these...
[01:50:14.890 --> 01:50:17.350]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:19.170]  So, again, I don't give up.
[01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:22.029]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:50:22.289 --> 01:50:25.670]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:28.130]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:29.609]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:38.329]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control overs with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:50:38.489 --> 01:50:43.310]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[01:50:44.699 --> 01:50:46.680]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[01:50:47.939 --> 01:50:49.140]  I mean, it's just...
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.520]  This is a joke.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.939]  This is ridiculous.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.560]  We're changing the world.
[01:50:53.699 --> 01:50:56.539]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:05.539]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:10.359]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:17.210]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:20.470]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:23.090]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[01:51:23.329 --> 01:51:26.090]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:51:26.289 --> 01:51:29.789]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:37.170]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the New World Order and BlackRock.
[01:51:37.409 --> 01:51:40.789]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:49.590]  We're taking AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:53.750]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[01:51:53.949 --> 01:52:00.449]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[01:52:00.729 --> 01:52:04.350]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:08.810]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[01:52:08.949 --> 01:52:13.229]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:26.199]  Alright, for the next 45 minutes, the mighty Max Keiser, been interviewing this guy for 20 years, is live with us.
[01:52:26.279 --> 01:52:29.479]  Then Marjorie Taylor Greene pops in for 15, and then more after that.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:36.720]  Some stations don't carry this first five, so I'm going to give you a prelude of what's coming up, then we'll give him the floor when we come back.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:39.340]  He has been dead on about Bitcoin over the years.
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.260]  The greatest crypto bull market has just begun.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:47.000]  It's just absolutely insane what's going on.
[01:52:47.199 --> 01:52:49.300]  Trump is fully behind it.
[01:52:49.479 --> 01:52:52.000]  But how do we make sure he gets into office?
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.920]  And how do we make sure this already lemon economy doesn't get blamed on Trump?
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.199]  How does he turn it around quickly?
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:03.460]  So, again, Max Keiser joins us.
[01:53:04.689 --> 01:53:10.449]  And I want to get just his gestalt or boil down of what he's about to cover with us today.
[01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:13.750]  Max, wow, just incredible things happening.
[01:53:13.890 --> 01:53:16.289]  We'll get into Bitcoin when we come back next segment.
[01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:18.149]  Everybody's tuning in to hear what you have to say about that.
[01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:21.949]  But just the election itself, is it not a repudiation of the establishment?
[01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:24.909]  Does it not signal the Great Awakening has gone into warp speed?
[01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:29.930]  What's your just general 35,000 foot view on the planet right now?
[01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:31.270]  Sure.
[01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:46.069]  I mean, the world has given up on wokeism and the extravagance and all the free money giveaways and the decline of the empire ran its course and the scoundrels are out.
[01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:48.890]  The American public just got fed up.
[01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:53.729]  They didn't want to accept any more of the transgenderism, the immorality.
[01:53:55.119 --> 01:54:01.239]  The wars of convenience, the mass murders, treating the veterans the way that they're treated.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:09.640]  So the American public, it's a testament to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the legal foundation of America, Alex, that it worked.
[01:54:09.819 --> 01:54:19.439]  I mean, it was that the people were able to speak regardless of a mass attempt to defraud the voters and to rig the election, as we saw in 2020 now.
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:27.840]  It's quite obvious that they We're good to go.
[01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:39.369]  It's a globally dominant economy.
[01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:48.390]  And then the Internet was invented really in the U.S. And the U.S. on the back of the Internet technology explosion once again became dominant in the world economy.
[01:54:48.630 --> 01:54:51.789]  And I think now we're going to see something similar play out.
[01:54:51.909 --> 01:54:53.609]  People had written the U.S. off.
[01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:54.270]  It was dead.
[01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:55.409]  It was never going to come back.
[01:54:55.770 --> 01:54:56.970]  Now I think it's back.
[01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:01.670]  And we're going to we have a chance now to really start to dominate again in the world economy.
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:10.159]  And you said that to me at Bilderberg like 14, 15 years ago, tried to give me what would be billions of Bitcoin.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:15.779]  That was too stupid to get it on a wallet on my Apple iPad or laptop.
[01:55:16.319 --> 01:55:21.920]  And you just constantly coming on five, six, seven times a year said, watch, Bitcoin will save America if we get a president that gets behind it.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.840]  And now Trump's full in.
[01:55:24.689 --> 01:55:27.409]  Let's talk about that when we join over 400 stations.
[01:55:27.569 --> 01:55:28.869]  We've been like 50 the last few months.
[01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:32.050]  All these attempts to take us off the air makes everybody want the show.
[01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:33.949]  Funny how the Streisand effect works.
[01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:35.869]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:36.670]  Stay with us.
[01:55:37.449 --> 01:55:37.890]  All right.
[01:55:37.989 --> 01:55:42.170]  To say that seismic events are happening around the world would be an understatement.
[01:55:42.449 --> 01:55:50.869]  The Bitcoin guru, Max Keiser, joins us from the Bitcoin capital of the world, El Salvador.
[01:55:51.789 --> 01:55:58.390]  But President Trump has pledged to make America the Bitcoin capital of the world.
[01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:01.250]  And I'm sure there's room for everybody here.
[01:56:01.689 --> 01:56:11.569]  But we have Max Keiser joining us to talk about this seismic event, how it ties into the election, the global political awakening, the realignment.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:13.939]  The dangers of the deep state.
[01:56:14.239 --> 01:56:18.939]  They appear to be capitulating in some ways, but also saying they're going to have civil uprisings and martial law.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:28.579]  I mean, I think it's all up in the air right now, but the old establishment that was trying to sell America out to China and others is being pushed aside.
[01:56:28.579 --> 01:56:29.680]  Now, will they go quietly?
[01:56:30.610 --> 01:56:32.670]  Or will we have to take the gloves off?
[01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:33.869]  That's the big question.
[01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:38.770]  So, Max Keiser at Max Keiser on the Mighty X. Thank you so much.
[01:56:38.829 --> 01:56:40.310]  He posted this tweet yesterday.
[01:56:40.789 --> 01:56:45.890]  I'm on Infowars tomorrow with Real Alex Jones discussing BTC shot at...
[01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:47.710]  And then there it is right there.
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:50.090]  That's a big number, a million.
[01:56:50.829 --> 01:56:52.250]  A Mid-East...
[01:56:53.210 --> 01:56:56.369]  Country going to announce a massive BTC position they're building.
[01:56:56.770 --> 01:57:00.449]  Trump's buying one million BTC. The BRICS are winning?
[01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:03.750]  Our golf tournament in January.
[01:57:03.989 --> 01:57:04.670]  Alex, are you coming?
[01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:06.470]  The President wants to talk to you.
[01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:07.550]  I know the offer's there.
[01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:08.810]  I want to meet you, Kelly.
[01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:09.590]  He's a great guy.
[01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:12.390]  Max and Stacey, Invitational.com.
[01:57:12.869 --> 01:57:14.729]  And we've got a lot of news here.
[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:15.989]  Are you paying attention yet?
[01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:19.130]  There are about to get wild if Trump signs.
[01:57:19.979 --> 01:57:31.199]  Ed Sumer, Senator Loomis' Bitcoin law bill, implement a 1 million unit Bitcoin purchase program to monitor the size and scope of gold reserves.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:34.819]  What that really means, there's so much happening.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:49.539]  Justin Max Keiser reports on rumors that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has entered the Bitcoin market and could be interviewed in purchasing up to $50 billion worth of BTC. South Korea's gone insane moving into it.
[01:57:49.659 --> 01:57:52.100]  Heavily, it goes on and on.
[01:57:52.199 --> 01:57:57.260]  El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings up to $203 million.
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:02.939]  Just so much here to hit with Max Keiser.
[01:58:03.079 --> 01:58:04.359]  So, Max, take it away, my friend.
[01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.729]  Right.
[01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:07.810]  Well, it's important to understand something.
[01:58:08.050 --> 01:58:14.850]  We've been coming on your show for almost 20 years, Alex, and we've been talking about Bitcoin with you since 2011.
[01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:16.270]  Actually, I just saw a video.
[01:58:16.649 --> 01:58:18.470]  I hadn't seen it in a long time.
[01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:19.470]  It's 2010.
[01:58:19.989 --> 01:58:23.250]  Stacey on Kaiser Report was talking about Bitcoin.
[01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:24.010]  So we've been...
[01:58:24.029 --> 01:58:31.550]  We were the first person to talk about Bitcoin in international news back in 2010 when it was still 30 or 40 cents a Bitcoin.
[01:58:31.810 --> 01:58:38.430]  But a few years ago, up until a few years ago, a lot of people would come out and say, what if governments try to ban Bitcoin?
[01:58:38.649 --> 01:58:44.329]  And I've been on your show many times explaining that We won't see governments trying to ban Bitcoin.
[01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:49.529]  What we'll see is governments competing to buy the most Bitcoin.
[01:58:49.810 --> 01:58:51.789]  And that's what I call the global hash war.
[01:58:52.029 --> 01:59:01.970]  And I really started talking about this quite heavily in 2019, so many years ago, that essentially it's impossible to ban Bitcoin.
[01:59:02.329 --> 01:59:04.050]  No government can do so.
[01:59:04.489 --> 01:59:06.069]  It's unconfiscatable.
[01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:07.310]  It's impregnable.
[01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:08.489]  It's uncensorable.
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:13.859]  So the only thing left for them to do is succumb to game theory.
[01:59:14.079 --> 01:59:19.539]  And now countries are starting to outdo themselves in buying bigger and bigger quantities of Bitcoin.
[01:59:19.779 --> 01:59:28.420]  Now, when President Bukele here in El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender a few years ago, Max and Stacey decided that we had to come here and live here and be a part of this revolution.
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.939]  So we kicked it off.
[01:59:30.039 --> 01:59:31.819]  We kicked off the global hash war in El Salvador.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.199]  And as you pointed out, El Salvador has something like half a billion worth of Bitcoin.
[01:59:36.199 --> 01:59:38.260]  We buy Bitcoin every single day.
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:43.079]  The Bitcoin office, which reports directly to the president, is run by Stacey.
[01:59:43.319 --> 01:59:46.279]  And they make sure that they buy one Bitcoin every single day.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:53.220]  And we keep out all of the altcoins and the garbage coins and the meme coins as part of the job that the Bitcoin office does.
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:54.619]  So let's get to Donald Trump.
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:58.600]  Donald Trump says, well, you know, he wants to enter the global hash war as well.
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:03.119]  He understands that the dollar and all fiat money is going to Go to its intrinsic value of zero.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:07.340]  As all fiat money, all throughout history, they all go to zero without exception.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.840]  The same thing will happen at Bitcoin.
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:11.659]  And they're all going to zero against Bitcoin.
[02:00:11.659 --> 02:00:14.199]  And everything goes to zero against Bitcoin, including gold.
[02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:18.829]  You see gold being demonetized versus Bitcoin.
[02:00:18.829 --> 02:00:27.550]  You see the gold ETFs are losing their value and attraction, and all that money is going into the Bitcoin ETF. So you see the demonetization of gold happening in real time.
[02:00:27.789 --> 02:00:49.380]  So Donald Trump and Cynthia Lummis, who put a bill forward in Congress and in the Senate trying to We're good to go.
[02:00:55.289 --> 02:00:59.270]  The supply of Bitcoin will never increase, no matter what the demand is.
[02:00:59.430 --> 02:01:09.130]  Even if all $400 trillion worth of monetizable assets on planet Earth go into Bitcoin, you cannot create more supply of Bitcoin.
[02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:10.989]  It's an absolutely scarce commodity.
[02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:13.369]  That means that the price can only go up.
[02:01:13.489 --> 02:01:19.470]  Then you have Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy just announced another $42 billion buy program of Bitcoin.
[02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:22.970]  He said it can go to $200 to $400 billion buy program of Bitcoin.
[02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:30.449]  As I mentioned, in the Middle East, you've got Qatar, you've got UAE, both rumored to shortly announce that they're going to put state reserves into Bitcoin.
[02:01:30.609 --> 02:01:34.670]  That would be another half a trillion dollars worth of buy into Bitcoin.
[02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:40.029]  You've got all the supply issues that were around because of the Mt.
[02:01:40.170 --> 02:01:40.949]  Cox distribution.
[02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:42.529]  Germany sold their Bitcoin.
[02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:44.069]  They're quite stupid in that regard.
[02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:45.409]  They already have lost Bitcoin.
[02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:47.270]  Billions of dollars selling Bitcoin.
[02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:51.130]  But that supply was a bit of a headwind.
[02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:53.069]  But now there is no supply.
[02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:54.489]  There's no supply in the exchanges.
[02:01:54.710 --> 02:01:55.449]  There's only demand.
[02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:58.449]  Trump, will he be successful in buying a million Bitcoin?
[02:01:58.770 --> 02:02:05.069]  Well, it won't be at prices that you see today around 70, 70, $80,000 per Bitcoin.
[02:02:05.329 --> 02:02:10.050]  He'll be buying Bitcoin at 100, 200, 500, $600,000 of Bitcoin.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:14.800]  Alex, Bitcoin just took out silver in terms of its market capitalization.
[02:02:15.199 --> 02:02:18.619]  Silver was valued at roughly $1.7 trillion.
[02:02:19.119 --> 02:02:21.180]  Bitcoin is now worth more than silver.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:31.500]  And I will tell you on this show that as 2 plus 2 equals 4 and as the sun rises in the east, that Bitcoin's market capitalization will increase.
[02:02:32.119 --> 02:02:33.300]  Be greater than gold.
[02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.600]  So gold at roughly $17 trillion.
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.279]  That means the implied price for Bitcoin is $800,000.
[02:02:39.779 --> 02:02:41.239]  It's currently around $80,000.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:43.840]  You can take that to the bank.
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.239]  It's absolutely guaranteed.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:52.840]  It's mathematically guaranteed to go to $800,000 to take out gold because it's a superior form of value and money than gold.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:03.270]  And the history of money is always a case where Those who have money flock to the hardest money, the scarcest money, the most valuable money, and that is Bitcoin.
[02:03:03.569 --> 02:03:04.869]  And that's not going to change.
[02:03:05.829 --> 02:03:08.550]  And let me just interrupt you briefly because I want you to elaborate on this.
[02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:10.270]  We don't have the crew to do it.
[02:03:10.369 --> 02:03:13.090]  We get more funds in because this is what goes viral.
[02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:18.369]  People love to see somebody predict something accurately because they know it's valuable for what they're about to say about the future.
[02:03:18.670 --> 02:03:26.850]  You have literally predicted on my show and your own show All of this basically with precision.
[02:03:27.210 --> 02:03:28.949]  You said Trump's going to win in a landslide.
[02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:29.750]  People are pissed off.
[02:03:29.890 --> 02:03:31.850]  It'll be too big to rig a few months ago on the show.
[02:03:32.729 --> 02:03:36.569]  You said there's a global Bitcoin revolution coming led by El Salvador.
[02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:39.029]  Once Trump gets in, he's going to endorse it.
[02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.770]  It's going to explode.
[02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:42.710]  All these other countries are going to start jumping into it.
[02:03:42.869 --> 02:03:48.869]  And then it will become the new global monetary system based on freedom and based on security and based on privacy.
[02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:56.500]  And all these other central bank systems and other attempts are going to fail and You literally have spoken into existence.
[02:03:56.539 --> 02:03:58.520]  I just can't believe...
[02:03:59.659 --> 02:04:01.920]  I'm sitting there covering Bilderberg with you.
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:03.039]  What year was that?
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:07.760]  Like 14, 15 years ago, north of London, in whatever town that is.
[02:04:07.819 --> 02:04:11.220]  It's some beautiful rolling green hills, this giant palatial facility.
[02:04:12.079 --> 02:04:15.220]  And days before they got there, we were talking at the hotel.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.979]  Then we went to our own hotel and we were kicked out.
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.640]  And it was like prophecy.
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:21.220]  I mean, you've already said all this years before.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.300]  Everybody has it on tape.
[02:04:22.479 --> 02:04:27.340]  But I remember you getting mad at me at like lunch and dinner.
[02:04:28.050 --> 02:04:36.649]  And for days, and then you get me in a car to do an interview, and you're still trying to proselytize me, and then it was the last day, and you finally said, fine, get out!
[02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:37.609]  You're not going to listen!
[02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:43.409]  And then I'm like, see you, and you wouldn't even, I think, talk to me for like two years after that.
[02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.970]  I get it, because you were really trying to help me.
[02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:46.510]  I wouldn't take millions in Bitcoin.
[02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:47.529]  I wouldn't believe you.
[02:04:47.710 --> 02:04:48.489]  It wasn't that I didn't believe you.
[02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:49.510]  I just wasn't paying attention.
[02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:50.189]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:50.770 --> 02:04:54.310]  Max Keiser, I know you're not a BSer, but you're going to give me billions of dollars.
[02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.829]  Okay, right.
[02:04:56.210 --> 02:04:57.449]  It's just so crazy.
[02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:58.750]  So you got the floor to go back.
[02:04:58.909 --> 02:05:00.170]  You predicted all this.
[02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.949]  It's now happening.
[02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:03.750]  Talk about what's coming if they don't kill Trump and this happens.
[02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:07.630]  Because this could, like I said, the new innovation like the internet, this could be just as big or bigger.
[02:05:07.829 --> 02:05:11.510]  This could really make us number one again and energize the world.
[02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:13.649]  Instead of war, we can have...
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.979]  We can have renaissance.
[02:05:16.539 --> 02:05:19.920]  So you told us what was going to happen 10-15 years ago.
[02:05:20.399 --> 02:05:29.100]  Now tell us what's going to happen if we're able to get these psychotic nutcases, this death cult with King Charles at the head of it out of the way.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:30.960]  We can just get these idiots out of the way.
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:31.979]  What's going to happen?
[02:05:33.170 --> 02:05:33.369]  Right.
[02:05:33.449 --> 02:05:35.449]  I believe it was Bilderberg in 2012.
[02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:37.710]  Bitcoin was around $5.
[02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:46.109]  I offered to give you 10,000 Bitcoin because I thought if you gave it to your audience, it would be a way to help spread the revolution.
[02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:47.810]  And it never happened.
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:58.539]  But nevertheless, I've been proselytizing Bitcoin on your show really since 2011 when we first heard about it and started talking about it on Kaiser Report.
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:04.239]  Now, going forward, what you're going to see is this mad scramble to acquire Bitcoin.
[02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:11.130]  As much Bitcoin as possible, which means that everything gets demonetized or everything goes to zero against Bitcoin.
[02:06:11.289 --> 02:06:17.930]  One of the reasons the property market in the US is so soft is that property market, real estate market, is losing its monetary premium.
[02:06:18.130 --> 02:06:25.310]  For many, many years, Alex, people just took it on faith that, oh, you buy real estate and it's always a winner if you hold on to it.
[02:06:25.409 --> 02:06:29.829]  But that is no longer the case because Bitcoin is a superior investment to real estate.
[02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:40.720]  A lot of real estate and professional real estate investors and REITs, the real estate investment trusts, They're all now capitulating and understanding that real estate has seceded the high ground to Bitcoin.
[02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:44.399]  Bitcoin is a superior investment to real estate.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.000]  We already know it's superior to gold.
[02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:47.960]  Obviously, it's superior to silver.
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:50.159]  It's superior to the stock market.
[02:06:50.859 --> 02:06:59.699]  MicroStrategy, which is basically a pure play, a leverage play on Bitcoin, has outperformed the S&P 500, every single company in the S&P 500 last year.
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:00.819]  And it's set to...
[02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:06.649]  The stock, MicroStrategy, just hit a new high after 24 years.
[02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:10.090]  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, the company is worth $2 billion.
[02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:16.149]  It's now closing in on $60 billion in market cap, and they just announced they're going to buy another $42 billion in Bitcoin.
[02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:22.069]  This is being mimicked by companies all over the world who are using their balance sheet as a strategic reserve.
[02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:24.770]  They're using their balance sheet to buy more Bitcoin.
[02:07:24.930 --> 02:07:41.489]  In the case of MicroStrategy, he has repudiated all known Economic and financial theory about corporate governance because he is selling stock and convertible stock and convertible preferreds into the open market, which would normally be a dilutive to your company's earnings.
[02:07:41.710 --> 02:07:46.449]  But since he buys it, buys Bitcoin with that cash, it's immediately accretive.
[02:07:46.609 --> 02:07:50.930]  So dilution becomes accretion and he's not going to stop.
[02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:55.670]  He said recently, just yesterday, he said to buy up to 200 billion more Bitcoin.
[02:07:55.909 --> 02:08:15.829]  El Salvador We're good to go.
[02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:34.470]  We're good to go.
[02:08:36.329 --> 02:08:55.090]  This means that in order to bring on a Bitcoin reserve and Bitcoin standard in the US, it's going to require a moment of truth when it comes to doing actual accounting of the actual books of the United States and the United States government, which means they're going to have to reveal that the US is sitting on a 30 to 35 trillion black hole of debt.
[02:08:55.699 --> 02:09:00.000]  That they need to come to terms with that and be honest with the American people.
[02:09:00.159 --> 02:09:03.340]  And they need to do radical surgery on the budgets.
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.479]  And they need to get rid of that.
[02:09:05.579 --> 02:09:07.640]  I mean, Elon Musk is the right guy to do this.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:10.199]  He needs to do to the U.S. government what he did to Twitter.
[02:09:10.399 --> 02:09:13.600]  Fire 75%, 80% of bureaucrats.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.279]  And you're going to do a lot better.
[02:09:15.279 --> 02:09:19.140]  Well, let's get to what Trump and Elon need to do with their government efficiency office in a moment.
[02:09:19.199 --> 02:09:19.960]  We've got you for another...
[02:09:20.619 --> 02:09:21.800]  25 minutes or so.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:24.560]  You got to come back soon because this is a quickening, as you said.
[02:09:24.939 --> 02:09:32.619]  What you're saying, and I see this, and clearly, you know, Bitcoin is not some 15, 16 year tulip mania.
[02:09:32.819 --> 02:09:39.739]  It is being adopted into the very integration of the financial system as the new standard, as you said it would be.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.359]  So it is too integrated, too accepted, too adopted to fail.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:51.699]  And so we are now can say, I think on this day, Tuesday, November 12th, 2024, it's a good day to say it.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.819]  This is the day that Bitcoin conquered the world.
[02:09:56.319 --> 02:09:58.640]  And the only question is, will there be speed humps?
[02:09:58.779 --> 02:10:03.500]  Can Sam Bankman Freed's, you know, spoil any of it?
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.119]  Can the murder of Trump derail it for a time?
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.460]  Clearly, it's a It is the new innovation.
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:11.520]  It is the new internet.
[02:10:11.539 --> 02:10:12.960]  It is the thing.
[02:10:13.359 --> 02:10:16.020]  Everything else is just a competing failure.
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:21.600]  And I think clearly at this point we can declare that Bitcoin has conquered the world.
[02:10:21.779 --> 02:10:23.960]  The only question is what will that look like?
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:25.779]  When will people finally figure that out?
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.020]  And how do people get positioned in that so that they're part of the future?
[02:10:30.119 --> 02:10:30.859]  Is that an accurate statement?
[02:10:31.599 --> 02:10:32.239]  Absolutely.
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:39.920]  I think it's clear to say that Bitcoin has achieved escape velocity, that it'll become the world global standard.
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:46.500]  And the total addressable market for Bitcoin is the market in financials on planet Earth, which is roughly $400 trillion.
[02:10:47.359 --> 02:10:53.000]  So you've got to potentially move from $1.7 trillion of market cap up to $400 trillion.
[02:10:53.239 --> 02:10:53.859]  So do the math.
[02:10:54.039 --> 02:10:55.220]  It's extraordinarily high.
[02:10:55.319 --> 02:10:59.960]  Let's say it captures 40% or 50% of a $400 trillion market.
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:02.779]  That's still, you're talking millions of dollars per coin.
[02:11:03.279 --> 02:11:08.659]  And that's the future of where Bitcoin is going because it is perfect money.
[02:11:08.779 --> 02:11:11.779]  And what do I mean by perfect money is that it...
[02:11:12.319 --> 02:11:21.300]  Is a way for commerce to happen without any friction whatsoever and without any problems with inflation whatsoever.
[02:11:21.619 --> 02:11:36.699]  So that since it cannot be printed by any government or corporation and there's a finite supply, therefore, anybody who makes Bitcoin and saves Bitcoin, they know that that Bitcoin will be accepted anywhere that they go on planet Earth,
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.239]  which is they can travel through space.
[02:11:38.239 --> 02:11:44.850]  And they know that in any time in the future, They can use their Bitcoin to interact and conduct commerce as well.
[02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:46.170]  So you travel through time.
[02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:49.310]  So you're saying Bitcoin is the singularity of currency?
[02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:50.930]  It is the singularity.
[02:11:50.949 --> 02:11:52.369]  I call it the Bitcoin singularity.
[02:11:52.449 --> 02:11:53.369]  That's exactly right.
[02:11:53.569 --> 02:12:00.159]  And it goes back to the history of our species because In the beginning, humans have always wanted to be able to travel.
[02:12:00.359 --> 02:12:01.159]  We're very curious.
[02:12:01.439 --> 02:12:03.479]  And the way that we do that is something called money.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:04.920]  It used to be pretty shells.
[02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:06.079]  It used to be pretty rocks.
[02:12:06.079 --> 02:12:11.300]  We would be able to travel and exchange these things and make friends in a peaceful way.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.260]  Humans have had both a violent and a peaceful evolution.
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.520]  And money represents a peaceful way to move around the globe.
[02:12:19.619 --> 02:12:21.600]  And humans instinctively like to do that.
[02:12:21.659 --> 02:12:23.239]  And we've always sought perfect money.
[02:12:23.359 --> 02:12:25.680]  And for thousands of years, gold was a good...
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:29.600]  A good money that allows you to travel, use your gold.
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:31.039]  Nobody turns down gold.
[02:12:31.199 --> 02:12:32.699]  Gold has been money for thousands of years.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:41.039]  But Bitcoin is superior to gold by every single metric by which you would say that gold is a good money.
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:42.359]  It's more scarce.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:43.840]  It's more portable.
[02:12:43.859 --> 02:12:44.899]  It's more divisible.
[02:12:45.239 --> 02:12:46.159]  It's more desirable.
[02:12:46.479 --> 02:12:56.779]  And desire is something that is, I think, the least understood aspect of Bitcoin because Also, as humans, we have an instinct toward beauty.
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:03.579]  You know, Jim Simmons, who is the most successful money manager in the world, he beats Warren Buffett, anybody in the world.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.359]  He died recently.
[02:13:04.359 --> 02:13:08.460]  But he had an amazing track record of compounding money in the 30% to 40% range.
[02:13:08.619 --> 02:13:14.500]  And his first rule of making money, his first rule of managing money was appreciate beauty.
[02:13:15.239 --> 02:13:16.340]  Appreciate beauty.
[02:13:16.479 --> 02:13:18.579]  Because it's instinctive in our nature.
[02:13:18.579 --> 02:13:20.199]  We respond to beauty.
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:23.460]  And the Bitcoin protocol is the Sistine Chapel of money.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:26.359]  It's the most beautiful software ever conceived.
[02:13:26.659 --> 02:13:45.409]  Once you study it, and as Michael Saylor has said, no one We're good to go.
[02:13:55.159 --> 02:13:56.180]  Back many years ago.
[02:13:56.319 --> 02:13:59.119]  And I told him at $10, $100, $1,000 to buy Bitcoin.
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:02.659]  And each and every time he had some reason why he wouldn't buy Bitcoin.
[02:14:02.899 --> 02:14:13.340]  And he looks like an idiot now because he could have really captured a huge piece of fantastic wealth had he followed my word on this.
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.880]  But the ego is a killer, Alex, as you know.
[02:14:17.359 --> 02:14:19.520]  Ego can really...
[02:14:19.789 --> 02:14:30.109]  Well, let's be clear, I did not take the billions in Bitcoin from you in 2012 or whenever it was at Bilderberg in England because I didn't believe you.
[02:14:30.289 --> 02:14:35.069]  I mean, I couldn't figure out a set of wallet up on my laptop, so I wish I would have.
[02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:37.189]  That was ignorance, not ego.
[02:14:37.449 --> 02:14:40.050]  Yeah, no, that's a different problem, a different situation.
[02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:46.750]  But I think when something like a Nassim Taleb or a Peter Schiff, I think their problem is that their egos get in the way.
[02:14:47.470 --> 02:14:48.430]  Let me just say this.
[02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:50.770]  InfoWars had a...
[02:14:50.770 --> 02:14:52.409]  It turned out what the accountants finally got in here.
[02:14:52.930 --> 02:14:55.630]  Over three years, about a $9 million shortfall.
[02:14:55.789 --> 02:14:59.250]  That donation we got in Bitcoin is the reason we've been on air the last three years.
[02:14:59.289 --> 02:15:00.770]  And many would say the reason Trump got elected.
[02:15:00.949 --> 02:15:03.869]  Even the bad guys say we've been instrumental in the first election...
[02:15:04.130 --> 02:15:06.970]  And then the second that was stolen and now the third.
[02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:11.470]  So I would ask people, we need funds to keep the new studio and new operations going.
[02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:13.850]  We're Bitcoin boosters here.
[02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:15.590]  Trump's a Bitcoin booster.
[02:15:15.789 --> 02:15:21.829]  And I would ask the Bitcoin folks, shave a little off for the info war and go to alexjones.live.
[02:15:22.090 --> 02:15:23.529]  That's the donation page.
[02:15:23.649 --> 02:15:24.770]  Vimeo, all that stuff's there.
[02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.550]  The shopping carts want to support great products.
[02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:33.609]  But please, folks, please donate Bitcoin now at alexjones.live because we need the funds.
[02:15:34.119 --> 02:15:34.699]  We're good to go.
[02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:41.069]  And just a repeat, you know, the president has asked me to ask you to come visit El Salvador.
[02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:47.529]  You know, we've got a big event coming in January, early January, and he'll be happy to meet up, do an interview, whatever.
[02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:49.390]  So, because he's a big fan.
[02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:54.130]  He loves what you've done, and he loves what we've been able to do together.
[02:15:54.409 --> 02:16:04.489]  And one of the first things we talked about when we first met the president in the end of 2021 was, you know, he follows the Kaiser Report, and he knows about Alex Jones, and we talked a lot about it.
[02:16:04.569 --> 02:16:05.430]  So he's a big fan.
[02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:09.050]  And this is a place where they have economic freedom and freedom of the press.
[02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:12.250]  And this is the model that America is going to follow.
[02:16:12.649 --> 02:16:15.609]  America is following in El Salvador's footsteps.
[02:16:15.909 --> 02:16:19.689]  The new Statue of Liberty is a volcano in El Salvador.
[02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:27.050]  This is really the- We're good to go.
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:52.040]  We're good to go.
[02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:11.290]  It means that they're going to miss out because Bitcoin is now, as you point out, it's on essentially the god candle, as I call it.
[02:17:11.370 --> 02:17:14.610]  You could see Bitcoin go up $100,000 in one day.
[02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:25.829]  If the UAE, for example, were to say, yes, we're aggressively putting money to work into Bitcoin, it could go from $80,000 to $180,000 in one day, literally.
[02:17:26.129 --> 02:17:28.329]  And I fully expect that to happen.
[02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:30.209]  So where is the U.S. going to be in all this?
[02:17:30.350 --> 02:17:32.520]  Well, they have to act Very quickly.
[02:17:33.159 --> 02:17:36.540]  And, you know, do they have the ability to act that quickly?
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.659]  It's hard to see.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:39.399]  I hope they do.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:42.700]  One inside baseball little thing I'll mention.
[02:17:42.879 --> 02:17:43.139]  Hold on.
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:43.620]  Stay there.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.000]  Stay there.
[02:17:44.079 --> 02:17:44.840]  We got to go to break, Max.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:45.739]  Come right back.
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:46.000]  Yeah.
[02:17:46.559 --> 02:17:47.840]  With the inside baseball.
[02:17:48.079 --> 02:17:49.079]  And, folks, it's clear.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:55.139]  As he's been saying, he was here with Stacey and my wife at dinner like four or five years ago.
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:59.659]  He goes, El Salvador, watch, it's going to turn everything around and it's going to be the model of America and the world.
[02:17:59.899 --> 02:18:00.979]  And it's all happened.
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:03.739]  I mean, it's like this guy has the crystal ball.
[02:18:04.319 --> 02:18:05.760]  Tomorrow's news today with Max Keiser.
[02:18:05.879 --> 02:18:06.319]  Stay with us.

[02:19:06.459 --> 02:19:15.280]  All right, I am gushing over Max Keiser because he's been coming on the show since I was in the old studio for a few years.
[02:19:15.459 --> 02:19:16.579]  I've been in here 16 years.
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:20.280]  I was interviewing him at least a couple years while we were over there.
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:24.079]  So, 18 years at least.
[02:19:24.899 --> 02:19:27.420]  And he was always, he was a top stockbroker.
[02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:32.159]  I mean, the guy used to be on like Nightline and stuff in like the late 80s.
[02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:33.079]  I mean, he's been around.
[02:19:33.659 --> 02:19:35.979]  And he's just dead on.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:38.620]  And this Bitcoin thing, we need...
[02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:41.489]  Super-innovations in energy.
[02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:46.129]  We need super-innovations in medicine, in travel.
[02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:49.829]  But there's nothing bigger than money.
[02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:59.760]  And if you've got perfect money, unifying money, that's distributed to the people and not centralized, That's what's been holding us back forever.
[02:19:59.959 --> 02:20:03.540]  I mean, look at Trump coming out saying he's in a ban above 10% credit card interest rates.
[02:20:03.659 --> 02:20:04.399]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:05.799]  That is such a big deal.
[02:20:05.879 --> 02:20:08.379]  We posted yesterday, it's got 40 million views on Real Alex Jones.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.739]  It's a great job everybody out there sharing those clips.
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:23.020]  But, I mean, this is just exactly how you get out of depressions, exactly how you get out of this globalist designed quagmire where BlackRock wants you poor so they can get you in debt and consolidate power vertically.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.579]  But then they're going to have a poor world they own.
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:30.219]  What's having trillions of dollars in a bank account if you can't spend it anywhere?
[02:20:30.819 --> 02:20:34.639]  Trump is smart and like, no, let's have prosperity so the money's worth something.
[02:20:34.959 --> 02:20:35.159]  Duh!
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:39.680]  So, I mean, Max, just incredible knowledge you've laid on us.
[02:20:41.579 --> 02:20:47.680]  What's the perfect scenario for Bitcoin if everybody just gets out of the way to the innovation and the renaissance versus bad scenarios?
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.940]  What are your warnings to Trump?
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:52.299]  You know, we can't start perfectly celebrating like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:54.399]  We can't start, you know, at each other's ding-dongs yet.
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.459]  So let's not just be totally positive here.
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:58.420]  What are the bad scenarios?
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:20:59.219]  What are you concerned about?
[02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:02.420]  Well, first of all, let me say this.
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:09.600]  I was thinking on the break that, look, if you come in January, Alex, I'll give you $50,000 in Bitcoin.
[02:21:10.569 --> 02:21:15.510]  You know, send it to your Bitcoin wallet personally, just as a thank you for what you've done.
[02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:18.510]  So you come here in January, 50,000, Bitcoin is yours.
[02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:31.629]  So having said that, what we're doing in El Salvador with Bitcoin is that we are reinventing the nation state to be a decentralized nation state, similar to the decentralization of Bitcoin.
[02:21:31.829 --> 02:21:32.590]  And what does that mean?
[02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:49.979]  That means that because Bitcoin is legal tender here, and because everyone has a node, I shouldn't say everyone, but The node of the Bitcoin that runs the network is becoming ubiquitous and that the high school programs and the program called Node Nation is promoting node ownership across the country.
[02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:55.079]  Pretty soon what will happen is the wealth of the country will be owned by the citizens.
[02:21:55.079 --> 02:21:57.899]  They'll own the Bitcoin and it'll be on their nodes.
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:03.760]  And that will mean that the government, whenever it needs money, will have to go to the citizens and ask them for some money.
[02:22:04.229 --> 02:22:12.729]  We're good to go.
[02:22:22.170 --> 02:22:24.049]  And so that's what's happening in El Salvador.
[02:22:24.250 --> 02:22:25.530]  That's the program I'm pushing.
[02:22:25.709 --> 02:22:27.729]  You know, I advise the president on Bitcoin policy.
[02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:33.209]  And that's my dream for El Salvador is to become a decentralized Bitcoin governance model.
[02:22:33.450 --> 02:22:36.010]  And that should be the way the world works.
[02:22:36.190 --> 02:22:38.510]  We should not be slaves to the government.
[02:22:38.649 --> 02:22:44.190]  The government should coming to us and asking us for permission and then raising money from us.
[02:22:44.329 --> 02:22:48.510]  And that's the way that the social contract should run.
[02:22:48.709 --> 02:22:50.409]  And with Bitcoin, that's possible.
[02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:52.770]  Before Bitcoin, that was impossible.
[02:22:52.770 --> 02:23:00.010]  You needed a centralized authority and a centralized clearing corporation to deal with the thing that you're using as money.
[02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:12.100]  And so you end up by over-centralization and everything that Ron Paul talks about, the central banks and the crooked ways of the central banks and creating money out of thin air and all the inflation.
[02:23:12.399 --> 02:23:18.780]  And inflation kills people's will to work because they know that no matter how hard they work, it's going to be inflated away.
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:23.159]  With Bitcoin, every single dollar you make, you own forever, potentially, for you and your family.
[02:23:23.379 --> 02:23:26.520]  And it's a deflation.
[02:23:26.739 --> 02:23:29.719]  The purchasing power of Bitcoin only goes up.
[02:23:30.079 --> 02:23:35.500]  You know, a house, when I first started talking to you about Bitcoin, to buy a house might cost you a few thousand Bitcoin.
[02:23:35.799 --> 02:23:37.379]  Now it costs you five or six Bitcoin.
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:38.920]  To buy a house.
[02:23:39.059 --> 02:23:42.260]  In a couple of years, it'll cost you one Bitcoin to buy a house.
[02:23:42.399 --> 02:23:46.620]  And in five or six years, it'll cost you a quarter of a Bitcoin to buy a house.
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:48.200]  That's the power of Bitcoin.
[02:23:48.659 --> 02:23:51.020]  That's where you want to be on that side of the economy.
[02:23:51.219 --> 02:24:06.139]  And once everybody has a ton of Bitcoin on their own nodes, and it's unconfiscatable, and the government can't confiscate it, and there's nothing they can do about it, and the government's holding fiat money, which is going to zero against Bitcoin, by the very definition, government is demonetizing itself.
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:09.940]  And this is, I think, the lesson that they understand here in El Salvador.
[02:24:10.159 --> 02:24:17.020]  It's a lesson that I think will be hard to bear in the United States because the U.S. is so unwieldy and so big and has so much debt.
[02:24:17.159 --> 02:24:22.940]  It's going to be a tough haul going forward, but maybe Trump can pull the rabbit out of the hat.
[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:23.620]  I hope he can.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.500]  I support him entirely.
[02:24:25.559 --> 02:24:32.360]  And if one country can do it, Outside of El Salvador, it could be the United States.
[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:33.680]  Look at a country like Bhutan.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:36.899]  Bhutan, they converted their hydroelectric energy.
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:39.200]  They've been mining Bitcoin for years.
[02:24:39.379 --> 02:24:41.559]  They now have over a billion dollars in Bitcoin.
[02:24:41.959 --> 02:24:43.979]  Bhutan is a Bitcoin superpower.
[02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:49.829]  And their definition of GDP is global net peace.
[02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:53.690]  They define GDP as how peaceful the country is.
[02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:56.850]  They have a totally different approach to growth than any other country in the world.
[02:24:56.969 --> 02:24:58.450]  They now have a billion dollars of Bitcoin.
[02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:00.760]  There's a few other countries that have it.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:14.239]  But the inside baseball thing I wanted to mention to you before the break is that the U.S. claims to have approximately 200,000 Bitcoin already as part of some confiscations that they've done in the past from people who were incapable of storing their Bitcoin.
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:19.500]  So they didn't do it properly and they opened themselves up to this type of situation.
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:20.940]  But the fact is this.
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:26.020]  Half of that Bitcoin or 100,000 Bitcoin is actually owed to a company called Bitfinex.
[02:25:27.069 --> 02:25:28.709]  Bitfinex is owed that money.
[02:25:28.909 --> 02:25:31.110]  So the US doesn't have 200,000 Bitcoin.
[02:25:31.309 --> 02:25:32.969]  They have maybe 100,000 Bitcoin at most.
[02:25:33.090 --> 02:25:33.370]  That's it.
[02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:38.110]  So they need, because they're going to have to pay back Bitfinex the money that they owe Bitfinex.
[02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:43.569]  And so they're not nearly as Bitcoin in doubt as they think they are.
[02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:50.229]  Now, what they can do, what they should do, is immediately start to dedicate energy resources to mining Bitcoin in the United States.
[02:25:50.370 --> 02:25:52.010]  The cost of energy is cheap.
[02:25:52.149 --> 02:25:54.090]  I think it's one of the cheapest locations in the world.
[02:25:54.209 --> 02:25:57.850]  Actually, right now, Bitcoin is a The United States is a Bitcoin superpower.
[02:25:58.129 --> 02:26:02.670]  They have the most Bitcoin mining going on at the cheapest rates is in the United States.
[02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:08.209]  Remember when China banned Bitcoin a few years ago, all that mining that was going on in China moved to Texas.
[02:26:08.489 --> 02:26:11.110]  So Texas is now a Bitcoin mining hub.
[02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:15.950]  It's the super hub of the world at the moment, and they get really cheap energy.
[02:26:16.129 --> 02:26:19.610]  So the U.S. should start to tap into that and do its own mining.
[02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:26.510]  And of course, This is the ultimate trick, is that the U.S. will start printing money to buy Bitcoin.
[02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:32.950]  And of course, that will be the day that Bitcoin could jump $100,000 in a day.
[02:26:33.129 --> 02:26:47.489]  When the U.S. says we're going to print, you know, half a trillion dollars and we're going to buy Bitcoin with it, which is what they should do and what they can do, then, you know, it's just another chapter in this move, this inevitable move.
[02:26:52.530 --> 02:26:55.329]  We're good to go.
[02:26:56.930 --> 02:27:03.709]  We're good to go.
[02:27:16.999 --> 02:27:18.239]  Software ate the world.
[02:27:18.479 --> 02:27:23.059]  Well, now it's a new thing to think about, which is that Bitcoin is going to eat the world.
[02:27:23.219 --> 02:27:31.299]  Bitcoin is eating anything out there that people value or has a tradable value will be swapped for Bitcoin because it's a superior form of value.
[02:27:31.899 --> 02:27:32.680]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:33.299]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:34.139]  It's prima facie.
[02:27:34.559 --> 02:27:35.139]  It's happened.
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:36.360]  So let me ask you this in a few minutes.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:36.680]  We have love.
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:37.360]  You got to come back soon.
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:39.340]  Max Kaiser, the Bitcoin guru.
[02:27:41.989 --> 02:27:46.229]  I see the globalist signs everywhere capitulating, knowing there are old orders coming to an end.
[02:27:46.329 --> 02:27:48.889]  The more they push us, the more we push back.
[02:27:50.209 --> 02:27:51.530]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:56.850]  I mean, Trump obviously needs to prosecute some of these criminals because that's justice that needs to be done.
[02:27:57.190 --> 02:28:02.610]  But at the same time, the globalists' cornered animals are even more dangerous to stability.
[02:28:02.909 --> 02:28:04.510]  How do you see this shaking out?
[02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:08.170]  Or do you agree that we see the old order collapsing in front of our eyes?
[02:28:08.209 --> 02:28:10.229]  How do we keep them from clawing us into hell with them?
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:18.639]  Well, yeah, it is true that the old order and the globalists have a big problem.
[02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:25.020]  Christine Lagarde at the IMF or the ECB is also saying the exact same thing.
[02:28:25.159 --> 02:28:26.760]  She says Bitcoin is an escape hatch.
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:28.139]  She's very frightened of it.
[02:28:28.239 --> 02:28:35.520]  But all of these old timers understand that what keeps them going, you know, they're in a Ponzi scheme.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:39.760]  The US dollar is in a Ponzi scheme and the globalists are operating a global Ponzi scheme.
[02:28:40.319 --> 02:28:43.559]  And that's why there's so much debt, because they get a cut of that debt.
[02:28:43.659 --> 02:28:45.040]  They get an override.
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:45.780]  They get the vague.
[02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:47.260]  They get the vague on that debt.
[02:28:47.379 --> 02:28:48.840]  And that's why the debt keeps growing.
[02:28:49.079 --> 02:28:53.819]  But the thing is that Bitcoin is not a bubble.
[02:28:54.399 --> 02:28:56.000]  Bitcoin is the pin.
[02:28:56.819 --> 02:28:59.200]  Bitcoin is the pin that's popping the bubble.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.559]  The fiat money world is the bubble.
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:03.780]  The fiat money world is the Ponzi scheme.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.520]  The central banks are running a massive Ponzi scheme.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.360]  And they never saw Bitcoin coming.
[02:29:10.329 --> 02:29:13.930]  And now that it's arrived, they can't do anything about it.
[02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:20.149]  So I said also, I made this prediction on your show, that I said this maybe three years ago.
[02:29:20.629 --> 02:29:24.329]  You know, we're talking about the U.S. Congress and government.
[02:29:24.329 --> 02:29:28.250]  And I said, Bitcoin essentially has a fifth column inside government.
[02:29:28.510 --> 02:29:34.729]  And now since then, Cynthia Lummis, Ted Cruz, and others have come out as Bitcoiners.
[02:29:34.889 --> 02:29:37.870]  So inside the government now, we've got Bitcoiners.
[02:29:38.239 --> 02:29:40.120]  And they're pushing this Bitcoin agenda.
[02:29:40.399 --> 02:29:43.440]  Because once you understand Bitcoin, there's no turning back.
[02:29:43.479 --> 02:29:46.739]  And you can't unsee what you've seen.
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:51.180]  And once you understand the direction and where it's going, you go with it.
[02:29:51.299 --> 02:29:55.000]  And now the U.S. government is fully orange-pilled, as we say.
[02:29:55.239 --> 02:29:58.040]  And they're now firmly in the Bitcoin camp.
[02:29:58.139 --> 02:30:01.819]  But they've come to it at a time in history that's not...
[02:30:03.049 --> 02:30:06.889]  Obviously, if they came into it sooner, they would be better off.
[02:30:07.069 --> 02:30:08.930]  But they've come to it when you come to it.
[02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:11.090]  And I wish them all luck.
[02:30:11.329 --> 02:30:17.790]  Will they catch up to El Salvador in terms of what we see here, which is hyper-Bitcoinization, hyper-awareness?
[02:30:17.889 --> 02:30:21.190]  And the optimism, as we've talked about on your show before, is very high.
[02:30:21.610 --> 02:30:25.690]  People love the fact that they have unconfiscatable wealth, that the president supports them.
[02:30:26.549 --> 02:30:28.190]  And it's really a nirvana.
[02:30:28.989 --> 02:30:30.629]  It's a fantastic place to visit.
[02:30:30.750 --> 02:30:35.129]  And I hope you come in January and see for yourself and verify what I'm saying here.
[02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:38.729]  This is really what America used to be.
[02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:40.729]  You know, this is where it's happening right now.
[02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:41.409]  This is freedom.
[02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:42.870]  This is the headquarters of freedom.
[02:30:43.049 --> 02:30:44.149]  It's the global capital of Bitcoin.
[02:30:44.149 --> 02:30:47.290]  It's also the global nexus of economic freedom.
[02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:50.049]  Incredible.
[02:30:50.530 --> 02:30:51.889]  MTG is about to join us.
[02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:53.030]  Closing comments.
[02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.809]  Max Keiser.
[02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:56.250]  Well, just thanks, Alex.
[02:30:56.370 --> 02:31:05.170]  You know, I know that no matter what happens, you'll be on the air, even if it means talking into a Dixie cup attached to a string, you know, with your neighbor.
[02:31:05.350 --> 02:31:06.250]  You know, you're not going to stop.
[02:31:06.409 --> 02:31:12.370]  I know that from your public access days during the Waco, Texas massacre when you got started in the 80s.
[02:31:12.829 --> 02:31:13.930]  Nothing can stop you.
[02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:17.469]  Alex Jones is the Bitcoin of broadcasters.
[02:31:17.770 --> 02:31:19.569]  There's nothing that can stop Alex Jones.
[02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:24.049]  And anyone who thinks that they can stop Alex Jones has always been wrong.
[02:31:24.049 --> 02:31:26.350]  And I look forward to being on your show again soon.
[02:31:26.350 --> 02:31:30.129]  No matter where you are, I'm with you, Alex Jones.
[02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:31.690]  Thank you, Max.
[02:31:31.850 --> 02:31:33.290]  Say hi to Stacey for me.
[02:31:33.889 --> 02:31:34.229]  Will do.
[02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:35.090]  All right.
[02:31:35.149 --> 02:31:35.590]  God bless you.
[02:31:36.129 --> 02:31:37.090]  All right, folks.
[02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:40.030]  Bitcoin has officially conquered the world.
[02:31:41.450 --> 02:31:44.629]  And I'm going to post that on X right now.
[02:31:44.969 --> 02:31:45.190]  Boom.
[02:31:46.129 --> 02:31:49.870]  And I think that's a very clean statement.
[02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:51.909]  I think that's an accurate statement.
[02:31:52.069 --> 02:31:54.149]  That doesn't mean that real estate isn't great in gold and silver.
[02:31:54.270 --> 02:31:55.969]  You need to have a portfolio mix of things.
[02:31:56.370 --> 02:31:59.010]  And Bitcoin, you know, takes some knowledge and research to get into.
[02:31:59.170 --> 02:31:59.809]  So be careful.
[02:32:00.610 --> 02:32:02.729]  But, you know, Max Keiser is the guru of that.
[02:32:03.209 --> 02:32:04.649]  And that was really powerful.
[02:32:04.649 --> 02:32:07.069]  But I tell you, God can take me off the air.
[02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:12.379]  And if God is working through us, and you don't decide to keep me on air, you can do that too.
[02:32:12.879 --> 02:32:14.739]  So I'm certainly far from invincible.
[02:32:15.659 --> 02:32:22.299]  But my spirit to fight is strong, and that's why we can be shut down tomorrow at this secret auction now.
[02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:24.600]  And they made a bunch of changes to it last minute, and I'm going to...
[02:32:25.039 --> 02:32:29.239]  Just wait and see what happens, and I'll tell you what happens, but it looks pretty weird.
[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:31.079]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:31.700]  I'm not going to give up.
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:39.319]  The crew's not going to give up, but we need funds to operate, the satellite uplinks, the servers, the studio, the legal, all of it, and to basically restart.
[02:32:39.399 --> 02:32:41.600]  And we've got a lot of it done, maybe 70%.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:43.579]  We're ready to go, but it's...
[02:32:44.370 --> 02:32:47.549]  We're going to, you know, have some fits and starts and things in it.
[02:32:47.889 --> 02:32:49.670]  And money is a thing that can fix all that.
[02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:50.809]  Plus, we have great products.
[02:32:50.909 --> 02:32:51.809]  So you want the supplements.
[02:32:52.649 --> 02:32:54.709]  You want to get the great patron apparel.
[02:32:54.829 --> 02:33:03.250]  There's a new limited edition designer poster that I came up with that I think is awesome with Trump, with that graph of how she tried to steal it, but he'd overpower it.
[02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:04.870]  I said, this meme...
[02:33:06.139 --> 02:33:07.040]  Predicts what's going to happen.
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:08.280]  We have that limited edition poster.
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:11.440]  It says back to back to back.
[02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:12.700]  That's there.
[02:33:13.139 --> 02:33:15.360]  And so I hope you go to thealexshownstore.com.
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:23.879]  We're good to go.
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:41.079]  But there's not a lot of profit in them because we're competitive.
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:42.059]  Our sponsor's competitive.
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:45.680]  The t-shirts are great, but an XXL costs like $16, $17.
[02:33:46.139 --> 02:33:47.100]  It's small, like $15.
[02:33:47.479 --> 02:33:48.799]  And we're selling for $25, $30.
[02:33:49.559 --> 02:33:51.340]  And then the sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:33:51.379 --> 02:33:51.959]  We get part of it.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.600]  It just takes a lot of t-shirt sales to...
[02:33:54.739 --> 02:33:56.819]  Fund the operation, but they're great because they spread the word.
[02:33:56.819 --> 02:33:58.120]  You exercise your free speech.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:58.920]  You're not intimidated.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:01.620]  When we show the word, the majority, we're bringing America back.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:02.899]  So get your Patriot apparel.
[02:34:03.659 --> 02:34:05.879]  Get your great limited edition posters.
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:10.100]  Get your amazing ultimate CMOS, Irish CMOS, the superfood for your whole body.
[02:34:10.579 --> 02:34:13.819]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:34:13.959 --> 02:34:16.340]  And if you go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash...
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.360]  VIP, or there's just a big red link at the right-hand corner.
[02:34:20.739 --> 02:34:22.659]  You sign up, $30 a month.
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:24.000]  Cancel any time.
[02:34:24.159 --> 02:34:25.819]  Get $40 to spend on the store each month.
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.700]  Everybody that's going to get product there should become a member.
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:29.139]  Then you love the products.
[02:34:29.239 --> 02:34:29.780]  We order them.
[02:34:30.079 --> 02:34:31.200]  We create a relationship.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:31.860]  You remember.
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:35.559]  We send you emails, special reports, special deals, special sales.
[02:34:36.559 --> 02:34:43.659]  All of it at thealexshownstore.com forward slash VIP. All right.
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.899]  Wow, we've only got a little while with her, and I really appreciate her coming on during all the busy things she's doing.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:35:01.280]  The great congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, with what happened in the election, what the deep state's going to try, the appointments, getting the right people in, all the great announcements that Trump is making.
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:07.120]  And then I got to spend some time because she is totally and completely vindicated.
[02:35:07.299 --> 02:35:08.979]  She said they were flipping votes first.
[02:35:09.629 --> 02:35:11.889]  They admitted they did it nationwide, but it still failed.
[02:35:12.129 --> 02:35:16.569]  She said FEMA is not giving aid to Trump supporters and conservatives.
[02:35:16.889 --> 02:35:19.549]  Now the FEMA person that was fired has gone public.
[02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:20.469]  They were told to do it.
[02:35:20.530 --> 02:35:21.629]  The documents have come out.
[02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:26.950]  So just vindication, vindication, vindication.
[02:35:27.939 --> 02:35:35.260]  That is happening right now for everything that Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:40.659]  And while we're getting her feed squared away, I want to play a clip of the FEMA official.
[02:35:40.799 --> 02:35:44.879]  FEMA official fired for avoiding homes with Trump signs.
[02:35:45.079 --> 02:35:46.180]  Turns on FEMA leadership.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.040]  This is not isolated.
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:52.780]  Well, I mean, hell, they had official FEMA video conferences where they said, we used to give everybody aid.
[02:35:52.879 --> 02:35:53.559]  That's egalitarian.
[02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:56.399]  Now we give it to LGBTQ whatever.
[02:35:56.399 --> 02:35:57.239]  Here's that clip.
[02:35:57.829 --> 02:35:59.889]  Stating that I was fired.
[02:36:00.129 --> 02:36:08.469]  They all alleged that these actions were made on my own recognizes and that it was for my own political advances.
[02:36:08.969 --> 02:36:14.610]  However, if you look at the record, there is a What we call a community trend.
[02:36:14.829 --> 02:36:28.010]  And unfortunately, it just so happened that the political hostility that was encountered by my team, and I was on two different teams during this deployment, they just so happened to have the Trump campaign signage.
[02:36:28.209 --> 02:36:33.649]  FEMA always preaches avoidance first and then de-escalation.
[02:36:34.290 --> 02:36:35.670]  So this is not isolated.
[02:36:35.930 --> 02:36:43.229]  This is a colossal event of avoidance, not just in the state of Florida, but you will find avoidance in the Carolinas.
[02:36:43.829 --> 02:36:54.309]  Senior leadership will lie to you and tell you that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.
[02:36:54.569 --> 02:36:57.329]  Demand for FEMA to give you those incident reports.
[02:36:57.819 --> 02:37:00.860]  It's gonna be the whistleblowers that bring down the corrupt left.
[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:03.780]  MTG totally vindicated on the election fraud.
[02:37:03.879 --> 02:37:04.680]  We still overpowered it.
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:06.760]  Vindicated on FEMA denying aid.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.500]  But first off, we got limited time.
[02:37:08.639 --> 02:37:09.239]  Thanks for being here.
[02:37:09.399 --> 02:37:10.100]  Wow, the election.
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:11.440]  What's going forward?
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:12.540]  How do we secure this win?
[02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:15.969]  Well, we have a lot to do, Alex.
[02:37:16.129 --> 02:37:18.850]  And as you know, we're in the lame duck session of Congress.
[02:37:19.090 --> 02:37:20.649]  This is the most dangerous time.
[02:37:20.809 --> 02:37:23.549]  It's the dying of the Biden regime.
[02:37:23.790 --> 02:37:26.329]  And we are going to have to be very careful.
[02:37:26.989 --> 02:37:29.989]  But we've got to make sure that our elections are secure.
[02:37:30.010 --> 02:37:38.569]  As you know, these last remaining House seats and a few of the Senate seats look like there's been a lot of election fraud going on.
[02:37:38.729 --> 02:37:42.590]  And I think this is a continued fight that we're going to have to have.
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:52.379]  I personally want to pass a law that requires a proof of citizenship and a national ID to vote in all federal elections.
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:58.239]  And I think that'll be something that we can accomplish in President Trump's next administration.
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:03.819]  This is so important for us to do because, as you know, you've seen the map, Alex.
[02:38:04.379 --> 02:38:09.180]  Where Democrats won, the blue states, is where they do not require ID to vote.
[02:38:09.639 --> 02:38:14.579]  So the most important thing we can do is require ID to vote, but also proof of citizenship.
[02:38:14.819 --> 02:38:19.500]  That way we make sure there are no illegal aliens voting in our elections.
[02:38:19.739 --> 02:38:20.959]  That will be critical.
[02:38:21.579 --> 02:38:24.500]  We're going into this majority.
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:28.020]  We have the trifecta, Alex, but it's important to talk about.
[02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:43.809]  You know, President Trump, he won with a landslide historic victory, winning 312 Electoral College votes and winning the popular vote by pretty much 4 million or possibly more votes.
[02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:46.229]  And we should have swept the house.
[02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:50.829]  This should have been a massive landslide of house seats, but we didn't.
[02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:54.049]  As a matter of fact, we barely control the majority right now.
[02:38:54.149 --> 02:38:56.770]  I think it's been called at 219 seats.
[02:38:57.190 --> 02:39:02.250]  I think we'll finish out with 220 seats, or pretty much close to that.
[02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:05.450]  But we should have had many more house seats won.
[02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:08.409]  I think this is a reflection of two things, Alex.
[02:39:08.629 --> 02:39:16.590]  Number one, Democrats are going to continue to try steal elections in states like California and New York, states where they do not require IDI to vote.
[02:39:16.989 --> 02:39:27.829]  Number two, it was the failures of this Republican-controlled House that did not motivate and energize the American people to vote for House Republicans.
[02:39:28.409 --> 02:39:39.549]  They were fully into voting for President Trump and they proved it with his historic victory, but they were not motivated to give Republicans a massive win in the House.
[02:39:40.049 --> 02:39:47.709]  Thank God that we actually do control the House because now we control the agenda and we have the trifecta, which is so important going forward.
[02:39:48.030 --> 02:40:03.530]  But we need to make sure, here's what we have to make sure of, Alex, everyone watching this show, you have to make sure that you remind House Republicans and Senate Republicans that is the MAGA agenda that they should pass, they should vote for,
[02:40:03.690 --> 02:40:12.270]  and it's Trump they owe their loyalty to, not the deep state, not the uniparty, not the establishment in Washington, D.C., not the globalists.
[02:40:12.450 --> 02:40:16.290]  It's President Trump and the MAGA agenda and the American people.
[02:40:16.430 --> 02:40:17.409]  That's who they work for.
[02:40:17.569 --> 02:40:32.649]  And we have got to make sure that we make literally the first few months the biggest time of accomplishment in Trump's next administration, but also we have to move forward at an aggressive, Pace, with passing our agenda,
[02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:48.979]  holding people accountable, people like Anthony Fauci, people like Matthew Graves, people like Mayorkas, all these people, they should be held accountable for what they've done in the weaponized Department of Justice and FBI. We can never, ever forget what they have done,
[02:40:49.059 --> 02:40:59.680]  not only to President Trump, his former staffers, his supporters, J6ers, pro-life protesters, parents holding their school board accountable.
[02:40:59.899 --> 02:41:03.260]  Also, with the mRNA vaccines, Dr.
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:09.059]  Fauci, what he did to this country, the FDA should have never approved that vaccine.
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:12.180]  There's so much that the American people suffered of.
[02:41:12.559 --> 02:41:19.479]  Coming from the Biden-Harris administration or regime, rather, that we need to make sure there's accountability there.
[02:41:20.090 --> 02:41:20.510]  That's right.
[02:41:20.610 --> 02:41:28.950]  It's very heartening to see Elon now turning his attention to Fauci and the poison shots to do the right thing, expose what happened, but also go after the deep state on that.
[02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:36.450]  Also, Trump, not just we're going to stop the smuggling of kids, the Democrats did, but find the children and prosecute the NGOs.
[02:41:36.729 --> 02:41:43.590]  It's the right thing to do, and it's an incredible political weapon that will continue to devastate the deep state and keep us on the offensive.
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:46.059]  Oh, I completely agree.
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:48.239]  I absolutely love Tom Homan.
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:51.979]  And I've been talking with him in the recent days.
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:54.500]  I'm so excited that his borders are.
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:02.559]  And this is going to be the most important piece of the Trump administration, is deporting illegals that have invaded our country.
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:04.940]  You know, Democrats don't like to talk about that.
[02:42:05.079 --> 02:42:08.139]  And here in the media, they're even talking about how much it will cost.
[02:42:08.319 --> 02:42:09.399]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:10.979]  They're saying, how are we going to pay for that?
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.659]  I'll tell you how we're going to pay for that.
[02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:14.000]  We're going to take all the money.
[02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:23.489]  That they have been spending housing, paying for, educating, providing health care, giving debit cards to illegal aliens.
[02:42:23.649 --> 02:42:27.309]  And we're going to take all the money that they've been shipping off and paying for foreign wars.
[02:42:27.409 --> 02:42:30.629]  And we're actually going to use that money for the safety and security of America.
[02:42:30.770 --> 02:42:34.010]  We're going to secure our border, but we are going to deport these people.
[02:42:34.149 --> 02:42:36.690]  They talk about, oh, what about children and families?
[02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:39.569]  We will deport them together, and that's the right thing to do.
[02:42:39.729 --> 02:42:41.010]  Families should be kept together.
[02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:43.850]  But Alex, you mentioned something extremely important.
[02:42:44.069 --> 02:42:51.149]  The amount of child sex trafficking, child trafficking, human trafficking that's happened in the past four years is horrendous.
[02:42:51.149 --> 02:42:52.969]  And we need to track down these children.
[02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:54.530]  We need to find them.
[02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:59.790]  And we need to prosecute anyone that harmed a single child in America.
[02:43:00.049 --> 02:43:01.829]  That's exactly what we should be doing.
[02:43:01.950 --> 02:43:03.209]  It should be our top priority.
[02:43:03.819 --> 02:43:06.420]  Another thing, Alex, is we- Marjorie Taylor Greene, stay right there.
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:07.180]  You're on fire.
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:07.799]  Stay right there.
[02:43:07.879 --> 02:43:09.079]  You've agreed to stay at least 50 more minutes.
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.120]  We're going to come right back to you on these key topics.
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:12.819]  Stay with us.
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:14.100]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:15.079]  They're coming after Trump.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:15.920]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:18.059]  We need your support, and you don't even come here and do this.
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.500]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:20.579]  Give it to Alex Jones.
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:25.940]  I don't want this guy to have to be, like, wearing a symbol, and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:27.219]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:28.940]  Oh, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:29.280]  Oh, they are.
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:31.959]  I'm not that important, but I become a rallying point.
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:34.299]  I become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:43:34.459 --> 02:43:34.959]  Explain that.
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:44.399]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[02:43:44.579 --> 02:43:53.420]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[02:43:53.579 --> 02:43:54.520]  Electronic soapbox.
[02:43:54.829 --> 02:43:58.809]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[02:43:58.950 --> 02:44:04.809]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[02:44:05.010 --> 02:44:06.049]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[02:44:06.209 --> 02:44:08.110]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[02:44:08.250 --> 02:44:10.010]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:11.069]  I do a weekly show.
[02:44:11.229 --> 02:44:12.610]  I spend more time vetting it.
[02:44:12.690 --> 02:44:13.590]  They're two different animals.
[02:44:13.729 --> 02:44:14.729]  They can't be compared to each other.
[02:44:14.729 --> 02:44:16.110]  They also take stuff out of context.
[02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.770]  I'm exaggerating.
[02:44:17.010 --> 02:44:18.090]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:44:18.229 --> 02:44:26.750]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[02:44:26.969 --> 02:44:38.329]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[02:44:38.889 --> 02:44:43.850]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[02:44:43.969 --> 02:44:46.129]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[02:44:46.309 --> 02:45:01.649]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was if we can inject you and own your bodies and own the bodies of your children and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[02:45:01.649 --> 02:45:03.709]  we've decided that we own your children.
[02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:04.690]  We make a decision.
[02:45:04.809 --> 02:45:06.170]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:14.959]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that, and we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[02:45:15.079 --> 02:45:18.020]  But I would say that we are at the very last stage.
[02:45:18.059 --> 02:45:25.459]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, if things don't happen that fast, Dale, you're being really dramatic, I don't think this election matters that much.
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:40.290]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this Over the last year, maybe two years, there's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for 40 years as a lawyer that watched his father when he was 13 years old be killed for exactly this battle.
[02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.930]  And his uncle.
[02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:43.209]  And his uncle when he was 10 years old.
[02:45:43.389 --> 02:45:55.309]  So depending on what window you look at this, we're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:45:55.690 --> 02:45:57.690]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:58.510]  People say they can't do that.
[02:45:58.629 --> 02:45:59.489]  Well, I got to defend those.
[02:45:59.629 --> 02:46:00.290]  We're going to win.
[02:46:00.409 --> 02:46:00.889]  We're already winning.
[02:46:00.989 --> 02:46:02.069]  The judge shut them down last week.
[02:46:02.190 --> 02:46:06.049]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[02:46:06.129 --> 02:46:07.350]  This is total war.
[02:46:07.549 --> 02:46:08.370]  We make it easy.
[02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:10.569]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.

[02:46:25.959 --> 02:46:27.420]  And I'll go in the office.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:41.260]  I just hope the money comes in, but we're going on the offense.
[02:46:41.479 --> 02:46:42.120]  We caught them.
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:42.899]  We got the documents.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.219]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[02:46:45.579 --> 02:46:47.520]  First steps start this week, and the enemy already knows.
[02:46:48.500 --> 02:46:50.340]  But I need money to do it.
[02:46:50.399 --> 02:46:52.360]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:52.959]  That doesn't matter.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:53.680]  I'm on this mission.
[02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:54.239]  I love it.
[02:46:54.299 --> 02:46:54.780]  This is great.
[02:46:55.079 --> 02:46:57.299]  But I need funds to fight a war.

[02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:00.399]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:02.540]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:12.690]  It's all there, and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds The fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet, but at least we're in the fight and we're starting to win.
[02:47:13.069 --> 02:47:18.229]  Final short segment with the completely vindicated Valkyrie of American Liberty.
[02:47:18.790 --> 02:47:20.870]  Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia.
[02:47:21.309 --> 02:47:22.530]  Congressman, we've got five minutes left.
[02:47:22.549 --> 02:47:23.350]  You've got the floor.
[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:25.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:25.379 --> 02:47:36.219]  You know, one thing I wish I could show to the audience right now is what is hanging on my wall in my office, and that is the articles of impeachment against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
[02:47:36.719 --> 02:47:38.540]  Those are my articles of impeachment.
[02:47:38.719 --> 02:47:39.879]  They have my name on them.
[02:47:40.229 --> 02:47:54.450]  I'm very proud to have pushed and really forced our House of Representatives to pass these articles of impeachment, this Congress, and that's the type of accountability that we need moving forward in Trump's next administration.
[02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:56.629]  We don't need weak-kneed Republicans.
[02:47:56.629 --> 02:48:00.850]  We don't want to return things to the status quo.
[02:48:01.049 --> 02:48:07.209]  We need to move forward with an aggressive agenda because the American people spoke overwhelmingly in this election.
[02:48:07.649 --> 02:48:11.549]  And the message they sent to Washington, D.C. is we're fed up with the Uniparty.
[02:48:11.649 --> 02:48:13.250]  We're fed up with America Last.
[02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:17.770]  We're not going to do anything with the progressives and the climate change hoax and agenda.
[02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:20.770]  We want to stop the weaponized government.
[02:48:20.850 --> 02:48:28.350]  We want to protect free speech, stop censorship, and also get the medical industrial complex out of our lives.
[02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:30.670]  But we have to bring accountability, Alex.
[02:48:30.989 --> 02:48:38.780]  And next week, I just want to let your audience know That we are having FEMA come before us on our oversight committee.
[02:48:38.940 --> 02:48:52.739]  This will be an extremely important hearing because as America is shocked to learn, we have found out that they have literally, literally been biased against Trump's supporters.
[02:48:53.049 --> 02:48:55.590]  And that is coming out in further information.
[02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:57.809]  However, this doesn't surprise us.
[02:48:57.909 --> 02:49:05.329]  This comes from the same people that called us Nazis, called President Trump Hitler, has called us fascists, racist.
[02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:17.370]  They've called us every single hateful name in the book, while in the meantime, they've harnessed the power of the federal government and used it against the American people and punished their political enemies.
[02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:18.850]  And that's what FEMA did.
[02:49:18.969 --> 02:49:22.090]  And they did that to Americans that were hurting the most.
[02:49:22.459 --> 02:49:34.260]  After a devastating hurricane where people's lives, their homes, their businesses were completely ruined and they needed help, especially from the federal government, who they support with their tax dollars.
[02:49:34.559 --> 02:49:37.420]  So this is going to be an important hearing.
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:40.579]  That takes place, I believe, on Tuesday of next week.
[02:49:41.789 --> 02:49:47.530]  Also, here's something that's extremely important, and I think we're going to have to continue forward on this one.
[02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:51.229]  We have to stop the trans agenda on children.
[02:49:51.549 --> 02:49:55.430]  And I have a bill called the Protect Children's Innocence Act.
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:50:04.760]  And the Senate counterpart for that bill, by the way, was introduced by none other than our now Vice President-elect, J.D. Vance.
[02:50:04.899 --> 02:50:09.020]  He holds the Senate counterpart bill to my Protect Children's Innocence bill.
[02:50:09.219 --> 02:50:19.440]  This bill will make it a felony to perform so-called gender-affirming care, which is the trans medical industry, on children.
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:26.059]  And this bill, this is something we've got to get passed and President Trump to sign it into law.
[02:50:26.239 --> 02:50:34.079]  These are the types of things we're going to be doing because our main goal is not only to put Americans first, but to protect our kids.
[02:50:34.299 --> 02:50:36.299]  And it's time to stand up and do that.
[02:50:36.399 --> 02:50:39.719]  And the American people spoke very loudly on that issue.
[02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:42.500]  That was across the political aisle.
[02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:48.639]  Americans are fed up with their children being the target of complete evil.
[02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:52.209]  There's only two genders, Alex, male and female.
[02:50:52.209 --> 02:50:59.649]  We are created in God's image, and we have to protect that and protect the most innocent of all Americans among us.
[02:50:59.770 --> 02:51:01.270]  But I'm excited, Alex.
[02:51:01.469 --> 02:51:02.670]  This is historic.
[02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:05.549]  So many people prayed over this election.
[02:51:05.549 --> 02:51:07.370]  They prayed over President Trump.
[02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:18.569]  And what I'm excited about is the opportunity that we have laid out before us to bring about a completely America, an American first agenda.
[02:51:18.850 --> 02:51:24.690]  You know, I was excited to speak with President Trump and others, Elon Musk, others on the phone.
[02:51:24.829 --> 02:51:28.250]  And one of the things we were talking about is ending the Ukraine war.
[02:51:28.409 --> 02:51:31.409]  That's a war that America should have never been funding.
[02:51:31.649 --> 02:51:33.809]  And President Trump will end.
[02:51:33.989 --> 02:51:35.569]  And it's going to end very soon.
[02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:39.209]  So these are the type of victories that we can look forward to.
[02:51:39.409 --> 02:51:41.370]  And I'm thrilled to be able to be a part of it.
[02:51:42.019 --> 02:51:42.920]  Congresswoman, we're out of time.
[02:51:43.059 --> 02:51:43.739]  Thank you for your time.
[02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:44.420]  I would just say this.
[02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.120]  I see the left worldwide being routed.
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:47.819]  This is ours to lose.
[02:51:48.079 --> 02:51:49.100]  Thank you for your leadership.
[02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:50.540]  God bless you.
[02:51:50.659 --> 02:51:54.260]  We are celebrating, but now we've got to finish the war and win the victory.
[02:51:54.479 --> 02:51:56.299]  Thank you so much, Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[02:51:56.420 --> 02:51:56.879]  Thank you.
[02:51:57.079 --> 02:51:59.860]  God bless you, Alex, and the whole InfoWars team.
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:01.500]  I'm always rooting for you guys.
[02:52:01.719 --> 02:52:02.260]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:02.319 --> 02:52:02.979]  Bye-bye, Congresswoman.
[02:52:03.659 --> 02:52:18.760]  Well, today, right now, At 2.06 Central Standard Time, PM, on Tuesday, November 12th, 2024, we're 68 days out from Trump getting inaugurated.
[02:52:19.079 --> 02:52:20.680]  So much good news happening.
[02:52:20.899 --> 02:52:22.340]  So many positive things happening.
[02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.139]  It's ours to lose.
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:25.639]  The world's woken up to the globalists.
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:26.819]  They're rejecting their agenda.
[02:52:27.479 --> 02:52:31.139]  And the Great Awakening is only getting bigger and more explosive by the moment.
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:32.680]  God is great.
[02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:33.239]  God is real.
[02:52:33.870 --> 02:52:38.149]  And people now realize, well, the New World Order, the globalists, the anti-human death cult, it's a real thing.
[02:52:38.270 --> 02:52:39.809]  Man, we better learn about this.
[02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:40.850]  We better oppose this.
[02:52:41.629 --> 02:52:46.170]  That said, the enemy is still going around harassing people.
[02:52:46.329 --> 02:52:47.790]  They're still attacking innocent people.
[02:52:47.989 --> 02:52:49.590]  They're still trying to shut us down.
[02:52:51.649 --> 02:52:57.450]  And it's so critical in the fight for human liberty that this operation stay on air, obviously.
[02:52:58.629 --> 02:53:13.850]  My goodness, right now, thanks to all of your support and all the things that are happening, and Elon Musk, we are conservatively, on talk radio, reaching 5 million people a day,
[02:53:13.969 --> 02:53:14.489]  conservatively.
[02:53:15.090 --> 02:53:22.450]  We are conservatively, at Infowars, on our own streams and videos, reaching another 4 or 5 million.
[02:53:22.649 --> 02:53:23.969]  These are conservative numbers.
[02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:31.290]  The clips we can't even keep track of that are breaking through even on Google and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok.
[02:53:32.350 --> 02:53:34.270]  I mean, I get sick clips all day long.
[02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:35.309]  I mean, my phone just...
[02:53:35.309 --> 02:53:37.469]  Joe Rogan sent them to me.
[02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:38.170]  Eddie Bravo.
[02:53:38.850 --> 02:53:40.149]  You name them, send them to me.
[02:53:40.670 --> 02:53:41.690]  Tucker Carlson's people.
[02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:44.190]  Elon's people.
[02:53:45.329 --> 02:53:46.170]  Oh, look at this.
[02:53:46.250 --> 02:53:47.510]  50 million here, 20 million there.
[02:53:47.729 --> 02:53:49.829]  Not just Dimension X. On X alone.
[02:53:51.629 --> 02:53:54.829]  And I don't have time every day to add it up, but I did yesterday.
[02:53:59.039 --> 02:54:03.659]  140 plus million views on our reports and videos.
[02:54:04.319 --> 02:54:05.500]  Just what we put up.
[02:54:06.819 --> 02:54:11.440]  140 million views on Real Alex Jones.
[02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:13.340]  I didn't even go look at InfoWars.
[02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:17.020]  I didn't even go look at AJN Live.
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:18.059]  That's the backup building.
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:22.559]  I didn't even go to everybody else copying our stuff.
[02:54:22.559 --> 02:54:23.639]  It's impossible to even look at.
[02:54:23.719 --> 02:54:24.840]  I mean, A, I can tell you.
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:27.620]  That isn't bragging.
[02:54:27.719 --> 02:54:28.239]  That's the opposite.
[02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:33.700]  That's a report to you from the battlefront of what your support and your prayer and your word of mouth has done.
[02:54:33.879 --> 02:54:34.559]  You did it.
[02:54:35.899 --> 02:54:43.799]  So, when it comes to the information warfare space, only Elon Musk right now is reaching more people.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:44.620]  And I'm not in competition.
[02:54:45.729 --> 02:54:51.370]  You know, because Joe does politics some, and he's very effective, and he overall, day-to-day, has the biggest show.
[02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:52.610]  Again, I'm not in competition.
[02:54:53.049 --> 02:55:04.409]  This is all hardcore, all pro-human, team humanity, anti-Satan, anti-Bill Gates, anti-Klaus Schwab, anti-UN, anti-King Charles, anti-Hollywood.
[02:55:05.090 --> 02:55:05.569]  And...
[02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:10.950]  We are devastating them together right now.
[02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:12.950]  I mean, it is bonker level.
[02:55:13.629 --> 02:55:21.370]  And I went to the gym this morning and I worked out outside there.
[02:55:22.129 --> 02:55:23.270]  Most people aren't out there.
[02:55:24.090 --> 02:55:31.610]  And then I worked out inside some and then I got in a sauna for about 15 minutes before I took a shower and came back into work.
[02:55:31.610 --> 02:55:32.590]  I was already here before that.
[02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:36.219]  And This isn't about me.
[02:55:36.659 --> 02:55:40.180]  This is that I'm well-known, you're not well-known, which is great, you have your anonymity.
[02:55:42.739 --> 02:55:54.260]  I didn't have multiple people come over and say, oh, the living legend has shaped my hand, and now the new thing is, I had a bunch of people, oh, we love you, we appreciate you, ma'am, and maybe we can save things now.
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:06.000]  I had two separate people this morning, a guy and a lady separately, Because one guy came up to me while I was coming out of the sauna.
[02:56:07.139 --> 02:56:10.239]  And he looks at me and he goes, thank you for saving the world.
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:12.799]  Now, we didn't save the world.
[02:56:13.139 --> 02:56:14.239]  Jesus Christ saved the world.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:18.799]  But we're trying to, with God working through us, save the world.
[02:56:19.079 --> 02:56:23.040]  And we've gotten a long way there together.
[02:56:24.159 --> 02:56:27.000]  So, mobbed everywhere.
[02:56:29.629 --> 02:56:33.090]  If I need to go to the grocery store or something, I put on sunglasses and a hat.
[02:56:33.209 --> 02:56:35.690]  Not that I don't want to meet people, but I just, I'm on a time crunch.
[02:56:35.829 --> 02:56:38.049]  I got to pick up a few things that, you know, were forgotten or whatever.
[02:56:38.649 --> 02:56:41.690]  And I keep my head down and I don't talk and I still get recognized and stopped.
[02:56:42.010 --> 02:56:45.729]  If I don't wear a hat and glasses, I mean, start taking a photo.
[02:56:45.850 --> 02:56:47.350]  One person, now it's five, then it's ten.
[02:56:47.829 --> 02:56:50.909]  It'll be a line of people wanting to shake my hand.
[02:56:51.770 --> 02:56:56.790]  I'm supposedly Satan, according to CNN and HBO and the New York Times.
[02:56:57.559 --> 02:57:02.219]  And because they're so reviled and people know they're evil, I'm celebrated instead.
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:05.860]  The crew has been such a game changer.
[02:57:05.959 --> 02:57:06.760]  They put up with so much.
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:07.520]  I love them to death.
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:08.620]  They are so important.
[02:57:08.879 --> 02:57:09.739]  I want to thank them.
[02:57:10.479 --> 02:57:14.500]  Obviously, the listeners, the people that have backed us, we can't do this without you.
[02:57:15.399 --> 02:57:17.639]  But we are at the center of the fight right now.
[02:57:18.579 --> 02:57:24.639]  And we are reaching now more than anybody other than Elon Musk.
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:25.500]  And I'm not in competition.
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:36.239]  Our numbers, and we're not in competition, are higher than anybody else's for the last month.
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:38.680]  And it's only growing.
[02:57:39.319 --> 02:57:45.420]  So we have absolutely hit the zeitgeist, 30 plus years of work, 30 and a half years work.
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:47.860]  God is 100% everything in this.
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:53.819]  But I wanted to give you the report here that this is amazing.
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:58:12.879]  And It is that tiny core of people that have made donations and that have bought product and that have supported us that are the center of that and you are just as responsible for our successes as I am with the crew.
[02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:19.770]  So please now understand the only area That we are not doing well in.
[02:58:20.190 --> 02:58:23.809]  And I know, just like Edward Dowd said, I don't need to read Economist, which I do.
[02:58:23.969 --> 02:58:25.850]  I don't need to know that it's a fake economy.
[02:58:26.670 --> 02:58:34.590]  I've got a bunch of family that have got military pensions and two jobs and people that have professional degrees and used to have a lot of money.
[02:58:35.010 --> 02:58:36.430]  I've got family all over Texas.
[02:58:36.629 --> 02:58:37.489]  Most of my family still lives here.
[02:58:37.889 --> 02:58:46.250]  They are all working two jobs, three jobs, just so they can go on a vacation and not be in debt and live okay.
[02:58:48.420 --> 02:58:52.739]  I know that as our audience has always grew in the past, we would see funds go up.
[02:58:52.840 --> 02:58:53.360]  Just a fact.
[02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:54.600]  Bigger audience, more funds.
[02:58:56.159 --> 02:58:57.700]  I've seen for three, four years.
[02:58:57.899 --> 02:59:02.139]  Doesn't matter how big the audience gets, the funds aren't there to really do what we need to do in this fight.
[02:59:02.719 --> 02:59:03.559]  So I get it.
[02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:14.319]  But this is something, supporting this broadcast, while you all see great products at the same time, that is where you can bet on freedom and your own defense and your own future, where it's going to have the biggest effect.
[02:59:14.479 --> 02:59:16.219]  So decide what you're going to support.
[02:59:18.279 --> 02:59:19.239]  Decide what you're going to do.
[02:59:20.100 --> 02:59:21.920]  I mean, if you're drinking tap water, you're nuts.
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:23.620]  Everybody needs a high-quality gravity-fed filter.
[02:59:23.680 --> 02:59:24.260]  We sell the best.
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:25.120]  I'm not even pushing that.
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:27.079]  But I'm saying it's win-win type deals.
[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:29.540]  So everybody wants Ultimate CMOS. You need it.
[02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:43.760]  It's the superfood with all the key vitamins and minerals and the best organic form of iodine that goes right in your cells and all the other great supplements on the site that are really high-quality and private labels of top brands and the great t-shirts and, you know, all of it is about the info war and your own health.
[02:59:43.899 --> 02:59:45.879]  So you need these products if you're buying it from anybody.
[02:59:46.950 --> 02:59:50.610]  But here, you really support what we're doing and the future.
[02:59:51.629 --> 02:59:55.610]  So, audience-wise, we're hitting on all cylinders.
[02:59:56.049 --> 02:59:57.069]  It's spectacular.
[02:59:58.069 --> 03:00:03.469]  Funding-wise, it's a long story.
[03:00:03.690 --> 03:00:04.809]  Just know this.
[03:00:04.909 --> 03:00:06.290]  Every time I think we're ahead, we're not.
[03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:09.549]  And so I need your support now.
[03:00:11.069 --> 03:00:13.170]  I need you to commit.
[03:00:13.930 --> 03:00:16.829]  And those, I hate to go to those that are already supporters.
[03:00:16.989 --> 03:00:17.969]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.870]  I'll just ask you.
[03:00:19.329 --> 03:00:23.670]  Because we're on 400 plus radio stations now.
[03:00:24.450 --> 03:00:26.969]  We're, biggest numbers ever at Infowars, on our own streams.
[03:00:27.190 --> 03:00:29.649]  Biggest numbers ever on X. Biggest, all over the place.
[03:00:30.209 --> 03:00:35.870]  And I sit there, and then I do not need to be spending half my time trying to find money to keep operating.
[03:00:35.950 --> 03:00:36.809]  I don't want to do this.
[03:00:36.889 --> 03:00:37.909]  This is not what I like doing.
[03:00:38.659 --> 03:00:40.819]  I go out and get you sponsors that I know are good for you.
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:44.239]  So if we're going to sit there and beat you over the head with something, at least it's something I know is good.
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:46.520]  If you lead a horse to water, you can't make him drink.
[03:00:47.299 --> 03:00:49.700]  But we need funds just to hold off the globe.
[03:00:49.739 --> 03:00:50.719]  Let's try to shut us down.
[03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:53.219]  They'll try to shut down the new operation even though I don't own it.
[03:00:53.959 --> 03:00:55.139]  And we're winning now.
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:00:56.420]  That's a whole other story.
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:00:58.280]  That's why you don't see it in the news.
[03:00:58.579 --> 03:01:04.760]  But this teed up to sell us tomorrow and the stuff I learned since yesterday afternoon doesn't look good.
[03:01:04.959 --> 03:01:07.719]  I mean, do you think the system's really going to let good guys buy this?
[03:01:07.819 --> 03:01:08.659]  Do you think they're really going to?
[03:01:08.799 --> 03:01:12.840]  I mean, maybe God's going to intervene, but it's just what I've now learned is just unbelievable.
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:14.340]  But it's just par for the course.
[03:01:14.479 --> 03:01:16.180]  So we've got to be ready.
[03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:18.360]  Now, the AlexJonesStore.com, separate from InfoWars.
[03:01:18.459 --> 03:01:19.840]  InfoWars shuts down, it's over there.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:21.920]  AlexJones.network.
[03:01:22.859 --> 03:01:26.319]  You know, alexjones.live to find all the support points.
[03:01:27.559 --> 03:01:28.159]  That's there.
[03:01:28.399 --> 03:01:30.020]  So mark those URLs down.
[03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:38.780]  I mean, if they buy it, bad guys buy it, they've said part of the sale is they want it shut down before their wire clears.
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:40.020]  I don't think that's legal.
[03:01:40.180 --> 03:01:43.520]  I'm going to try to push to have the court certify the purchase to keep us on air.
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:47.159]  It only makes more money for the estate anyways and with the product at m4store.com.
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:49.639]  So there's no reason for them to do that except they want us off the air, which they've said.
[03:01:50.659 --> 03:01:56.000]  So I intend to stay on the air tomorrow, right till they come here, and flip the switch off.
[03:01:56.479 --> 03:01:57.059]  All right?
[03:01:57.399 --> 03:01:59.520]  And my office, you know, is already cleaned out.
[03:01:59.659 --> 03:02:02.799]  I would love anything more than to bring my stuff back in.
[03:02:03.559 --> 03:02:07.399]  And, you know, hang the mementos back on the walls, and maybe God's going to intervene.
[03:02:07.639 --> 03:02:08.680]  Maybe it's not God's plan.
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:09.200]  This continues.
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:13.120]  But now is action time in my 30 years of operations.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:14.700]  This is when I need your support.
[03:02:15.139 --> 03:02:16.440]  It's not rocket science.
[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:23.739]  And the reason Trump won and overrode the fraud, they still stole some Senate and House seats that's coming out, It was because people donated massively.
[03:02:23.940 --> 03:02:24.780]  They protested.
[03:02:24.879 --> 03:02:25.739]  They spread the word.
[03:02:25.959 --> 03:02:29.959]  They weren't intimidated to wear the shirts and show other people that were scared to come out of the closet for freedom.
[03:02:30.659 --> 03:02:32.680]  And people gave massive donations to Trump.
[03:02:32.799 --> 03:02:42.139]  It was over almost $200 million, they're saying, to have the lawyers and everybody in all 50 states and to have the ground game before and to file the lawsuits so they could have poll watchers and could have lawyers there.
[03:02:42.260 --> 03:02:45.360]  So when the truck showed up at midnight, they, you know, oh, these are fraudulent.
[03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:46.040]  You can't have them.
[03:02:46.139 --> 03:02:47.200]  And they found all these states.
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:47.719]  They flipped.
[03:02:47.819 --> 03:02:48.440]  It flipped back.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:50.680]  The news barely covers it.
[03:02:51.299 --> 03:02:56.739]  Where they caught them flipping states like Michigan and others in congressional races.
[03:02:57.719 --> 03:03:01.700]  And it was all people that were willing to do the right thing and money.
[03:03:01.879 --> 03:03:07.819]  And you notice the Democrats came out a month ago and said, any lawyers helping Trump and helping watch the election, we're going to indict you.
[03:03:08.059 --> 03:03:09.200]  We're going to disbar you.
[03:03:09.260 --> 03:03:10.200]  And they said, well, screw you.
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:13.719]  The people are facing prison and disbarment.
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:15.159]  Okay?
[03:03:15.340 --> 03:03:18.319]  And they said, America found its guts and its soul and said, we're going to do it.
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:20.180]  They threatened every one of his lawyers.
[03:03:20.379 --> 03:03:22.059]  So we had to have people that were willing to fight.
[03:03:22.819 --> 03:03:23.879]  We had to have money.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:25.500]  And we won.
[03:03:26.719 --> 03:03:29.200]  Because people were not naive about the evil we faced.
[03:03:29.459 --> 03:03:30.659]  We couldn't be gaslit.
[03:03:31.139 --> 03:03:34.180]  The money was put in, the energy, and we had men and women that weren't cowards.
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:42.000]  Now, with that model, that's the model that makes the world go, like Thomas Jefferson said, evil men and tyrants flourish when good men do nothing.
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:44.260]  With that, we can re-find victory.
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:50.239]  But this operation, with your word of mouth, your prayer, you're watching us live on X, share it to your email list.
[03:03:50.500 --> 03:03:51.840]  Share it to your text messages.
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:53.799]  Share it by word of mouth.
[03:03:53.920 --> 03:03:54.579]  That's what you're doing.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:55.579]  It's having a huge effect.
[03:03:55.719 --> 03:03:56.520]  Keep doing it.
[03:03:57.459 --> 03:03:58.459]  It's an info war.
[03:03:58.639 --> 03:04:00.260]  They want this off the air for a reason.
[03:04:00.459 --> 03:04:01.780]  What they fear, boost.
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:02.500]  It's obvious.
[03:04:03.399 --> 03:04:04.340]  We're over the target.
[03:04:05.770 --> 03:04:09.729]  And tell people, hey, the forbidden show, the system doesn't want you to see, is here.
[03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:12.329]  Share the link from infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:04:12.469 --> 03:04:14.870]  But that could be shut down by tomorrow afternoon.
[03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:20.510]  I'm going to be here late into the night at the new backup studio, getting it all ready, all prepared.
[03:04:20.629 --> 03:04:21.770]  The bigger studio's not ready.
[03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:22.489]  It's getting built.
[03:04:23.569 --> 03:04:24.709]  It doesn't just take money.
[03:04:24.829 --> 03:04:29.569]  It takes will and time and energy and a lot of moving parts.
[03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:35.569]  Because if they killed Elon Musk, God forbid, tomorrow, and took X off, we're still on talk radio.
[03:04:35.729 --> 03:04:37.090]  We have satellite uplinks.
[03:04:38.530 --> 03:04:39.889]  That's 18 grand a month.
[03:04:40.209 --> 03:04:40.909]  TV uplinks.
[03:04:41.010 --> 03:04:42.729]  We're number one on cloud TV and a bunch of other systems.
[03:04:42.930 --> 03:04:45.450]  I don't even mention our cable stations because they'll harass them.
[03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:47.649]  I don't tell you our affiliates because they harass them.
[03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:50.629]  We're getting turned on cable and TV stations all over the country.
[03:04:52.030 --> 03:04:54.370]  We are in the midst of victory right now.
[03:04:56.250 --> 03:04:57.850]  The one missing link.
[03:04:59.030 --> 03:05:00.270]  The one variable.
[03:05:01.180 --> 03:05:03.459]  Can you not see right what's in your face?
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:07.459]  And can a horse be led to water and will it drink?
[03:05:08.319 --> 03:05:08.940]  That's it.
[03:05:09.579 --> 03:05:13.819]  And I'm not going to beat up the tens of millions watching right now.
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:15.579]  This is not a Netflix show.
[03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:16.420]  This is interactive.
[03:05:17.959 --> 03:05:19.520]  This is not a spectator sport.
[03:05:19.879 --> 03:05:28.059]  When you word of mouth this show, when you pray for this broadcast, when you buy products from us, it is devastating to the new world order.
[03:05:28.459 --> 03:05:30.200]  You're not giving something up.
[03:05:30.340 --> 03:05:32.180]  You're gaining being part of history.
[03:05:33.979 --> 03:05:35.239]  I am in your hands.
[03:05:35.399 --> 03:05:36.260]  You are in my hands.
[03:05:36.399 --> 03:05:37.180]  Figure it out yet?
[03:05:38.219 --> 03:05:41.219]  I want to thank those that do support, and I want to tell others, look in the mirror.
[03:05:42.209 --> 03:05:43.629]  Plus, you get great products delivered to your door.
[03:05:44.049 --> 03:05:48.069]  Wearing a Trump shirt, an InfoWars shirt, an Alex Jones shirt, a cap is an adventure.
[03:05:48.350 --> 03:05:49.850]  You'll probably get your dinner bought for you.
[03:05:50.709 --> 03:05:54.450]  You'll get 99% love, unless you go in some leftist area, but you'll still get love.
[03:05:54.690 --> 03:05:55.909]  You might get hit on the head with a hammer.
[03:05:56.190 --> 03:05:58.850]  The point is, this is an adventure getting in the fight.
[03:05:59.010 --> 03:05:59.489]  Do it now.
[03:05:59.610 --> 03:06:00.250]  Get off the fence.
[03:06:00.729 --> 03:06:01.750]  We're going to win this thing.
[03:06:02.440 --> 03:06:04.420]  All right, Kirk Elliott's with us for the rest of the hour.
[03:06:05.079 --> 03:06:11.799]  Great economist, great theologian, been on the board of Focus with the Family, such great folks fighting the New World Order.
[03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:18.180]  Great guy with WorldNetDaily, a 25-year overnight success story, the biggest silver broker in the United States.
[03:06:18.829 --> 03:06:20.989]  Because he's telling people to buy silver, which was the right move.
[03:06:21.610 --> 03:06:23.829]  And as soon as he tells you to get gold, he'll be the biggest gold broker.
[03:06:23.930 --> 03:06:25.489]  Because he's got the best deals, the best everything.
[03:06:25.729 --> 03:06:26.629]  And yeah, he's a sponsor.
[03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:29.870]  And yeah, you should go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:06:30.010 --> 03:06:33.409]  That way they know that I sent you and we get some support here.
[03:06:33.569 --> 03:06:34.569]  We'll put that on screen.
[03:06:35.829 --> 03:06:36.629]  KEPM.com.
[03:06:37.690 --> 03:06:42.049]  That's Kirk Kelly Precious Metals, KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-300.
[03:06:42.770 --> 03:06:45.850]  Call, get a free consultation, go to the email form, they'll call you back.
[03:06:46.209 --> 03:06:47.690]  They'll find out what your hopes and dreams are.
[03:06:47.770 --> 03:06:49.950]  The best thing to do is flip your IRAs into gold and silver.
[03:06:50.209 --> 03:06:53.969]  You would have made 50% on silver in the last year if you listened to me and Kirk.
[03:06:54.489 --> 03:06:56.750]  Massive amount on gold, really a smart thing to do.
[03:06:57.209 --> 03:06:59.129]  And I'll only steer you what I think is the best bet.
[03:06:59.250 --> 03:06:59.809]  Is it perfect?
[03:06:59.969 --> 03:07:01.569]  No, nothing but Jesus says.
[03:07:01.809 --> 03:07:04.909]  But the point is, is that you should make that move now.
[03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:09.059]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 720-605-3900.
[03:07:09.059 --> 03:07:11.100]  And Kirk's going to back us no matter what happens to us.
[03:07:11.139 --> 03:07:12.440]  That's another key piece to this fight.
[03:07:12.579 --> 03:07:14.100]  You get a great product, great service.
[03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:16.219]  We stay on here to keep fighting for freedom.
[03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:18.559]  But he's got a big stack of news.
[03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:20.100]  He wants to go over big developments.
[03:07:20.319 --> 03:07:22.819]  What does the Trump win mean?
[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:23.920]  What's coming next?
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:24.139]  Dr.
[03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:26.600]  Kirk Elliott, we're going to break in about seven, eight minutes.
[03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:28.200]  You got the floor, and I'll come back with you after.
[03:07:29.379 --> 03:07:32.120]  Alright, well, it's so good to be with you again.
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:40.579]  And, you know, watching Max Keiser right before I got on, it's like, there are so many things happening in the market right now.
[03:07:40.700 --> 03:07:44.579]  And Trump did some incredible things, right?
[03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:47.840]  Even markets already, Alex, are...
[03:07:47.959 --> 03:07:53.780]  Are basically responding globally to what Trump is going to mean to the global economy.
[03:07:54.399 --> 03:07:55.899]  Because what is he gonna do?
[03:07:56.100 --> 03:08:00.879]  He's gonna do what every good president should do, make America great again, right?
[03:08:00.959 --> 03:08:01.979]  That's not just Trump thing.
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:03.379]  Every president should do that.
[03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:04.680]  Well, how do you do that?
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:07.979]  Well, you have to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.
[03:08:08.059 --> 03:08:09.139]  He's going to do that.
[03:08:09.299 --> 03:08:11.159]  Some of his economic policies are just that.
[03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:13.360]  You've got to increase wages.
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:14.920]  You've got to lower taxes.
[03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:17.639]  You've got to get money back into the hands of the people, right?
[03:08:17.860 --> 03:08:21.180]  So this is what Trump is going to bring.
[03:08:21.379 --> 03:08:24.079]  So you've got now the Federal Reserve.
[03:08:24.780 --> 03:08:30.020]  Which has said all kinds of times throughout the last 12 months, we're going to lower interest rates.
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:31.280]  We're going to keep lowering interest rates.
[03:08:31.379 --> 03:08:33.059]  We've got to lower them to stimulate the economy.
[03:08:33.299 --> 03:08:42.299]  Well, as of three days ago, Jerome Powell said, well, maybe we don't have to lower interest rates so much next year, right?
[03:08:42.399 --> 03:08:44.659]  We can slow down that train.
[03:08:44.799 --> 03:08:45.739]  Because why?
[03:08:46.459 --> 03:08:55.139]  Because After the election was just had, the notion that the economy is going to grow is there.
[03:08:55.299 --> 03:09:01.020]  See, you have to lower interest rates to stimulate a broken economy, which was what Kamala Harris would have brought.
[03:09:01.200 --> 03:09:03.159]  So now they're all changing their tune, right?
[03:09:03.219 --> 03:09:04.659]  We don't have to lower rates so much.
[03:09:04.819 --> 03:09:11.340]  So lowering interest rates will actually create actually more inflation, right?
[03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:15.579]  And some inflation is good, some inflation is bad.
[03:09:15.579 --> 03:09:17.100]  So what's a good kind of inflation?
[03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:23.829]  Inflation is an increasing in the money supply, right, that causes prices to go up.
[03:09:24.030 --> 03:09:31.489]  So if you have the Biden-Harris economy, right, this is the compare and contrast here.
[03:09:31.750 --> 03:09:38.670]  A Biden-Harris economy had low wages, Unemployment was skyrocketing.
[03:09:38.989 --> 03:09:40.469]  Taxes were going through the roof.
[03:09:40.590 --> 03:09:46.069]  And they had to print money like there was no tomorrow, right, to keep the economy stimulated.
[03:09:46.350 --> 03:09:48.129]  Well, that's inflation, right?
[03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:51.510]  That's bad inflation, though, because wages aren't keeping up with it.
[03:09:51.629 --> 03:09:54.309]  And that's ultimately the destruction of a society.
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:58.500]  Under a Trump inflationary policy, right?
[03:09:58.639 --> 03:10:05.559]  But I want to contrast it to inflation is good because it means the economy is growing, right?
[03:10:05.680 --> 03:10:06.719]  So this is a good inflation.
[03:10:07.139 --> 03:10:12.700]  If the economy is growing because people are working, people are spending money, they can afford higher prices, right?
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:15.399]  So this is the good kind of inflation.
[03:10:15.639 --> 03:10:20.159]  Now, you're going to hear the rhetoric from the left that says, oh, Trump is going to bring massive inflation.
[03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:25.479]  Some of his stuff will, because that's what a growing economy does, right?
[03:10:25.520 --> 03:10:26.860]  That's absolutely what it does.
[03:10:26.979 --> 03:10:35.100]  But you need something that will actually outpace the inflationary pressures of a growing economy.
[03:10:35.299 --> 03:10:38.700]  I can't overstress that enough, right?
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:45.719]  So they're going to lower the interest rate reductions because they see that the economy is going to grow.
[03:10:45.920 --> 03:10:53.200]  Now, where does all of this talk Come in about the tariffs and things like that.
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:54.319]  What is that going to do?
[03:10:55.850 --> 03:11:06.629]  So what lies ahead in this economy is when Trump becomes president, I would say almost on day one, he's going to start doing a lot of different things.
[03:11:06.809 --> 03:11:10.729]  And number one is you've got to bring jobs back to America.
[03:11:10.930 --> 03:11:20.090]  You've got to stimulate this broken economy where people aren't working, where they can't afford to feed their babies or pay their rent or pay their mortgages, right?
[03:11:20.290 --> 03:11:21.969]  So how do you do that?
[03:11:22.979 --> 03:11:23.420]  Exactly.
[03:11:24.079 --> 03:11:30.780]  And talk about that, but then he can't get the rest of his agenda through culturally and security-wise if he doesn't get the economy going.
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:33.559]  So that's job one is get the economy going.
[03:11:33.760 --> 03:11:39.260]  And as you said, and I had Edward Dowling earlier, I mean, he's being handed a disaster zone.
[03:11:40.549 --> 03:11:40.889]  Yeah.
[03:11:41.309 --> 03:11:43.170]  I mean, Edward Dowd wrote this article.
[03:11:43.209 --> 03:11:48.129]  It's like it's the turd of an economy that Trump is inheriting.
[03:11:48.290 --> 03:11:50.569]  See, the numbers are so bad.
[03:11:50.569 --> 03:11:57.250]  If you look at what Trump has inherited from from Biden, It is so bad.
[03:11:57.450 --> 03:12:00.309]  It's negative 2% wage growth.
[03:12:00.489 --> 03:12:01.149]  Negative 2.
[03:12:01.329 --> 03:12:05.370]  The last time we had that was, well, let's see.
[03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:08.530]  We had that when Clinton won in a landslide.
[03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:11.790]  You had that when Reagan won in a landslide.
[03:12:12.090 --> 03:12:12.989]  You had negative two.
[03:12:13.069 --> 03:12:16.870]  How did Reagan fix this negative wage growth, right?
[03:12:16.989 --> 03:12:20.629]  This massive inflation that we had during that time.
[03:12:20.770 --> 03:12:23.850]  Because after the Carter years, we had high inflation, high taxes.
[03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:28.090]  The highest personal income tax bracket was like well over 70%.
[03:12:28.090 --> 03:12:29.290]  It was insane.
[03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:33.049]  They had to jack up interest rates to slow down that inflation.
[03:12:33.690 --> 03:12:39.870]  So now, Clinton won in a landslide because of negative wage growth.
[03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:43.709]  Trump won in a landslide because of negative wage growth.
[03:12:43.770 --> 03:12:46.170]  So people vote with their wallets.
[03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:56.290]  So bringing these jobs back will bring the cultural and social change that's needed in this country when people are making money, when they can afford to feed their babies.
[03:12:56.309 --> 03:13:02.639]  So what lies ahead is I think?
[03:13:18.989 --> 03:13:21.750]  From Europe, it's going to be 10% to 20% more.
[03:13:21.989 --> 03:13:25.110]  China could be 20% to 60% more expensive.
[03:13:25.389 --> 03:13:30.850]  Cars coming in from Mexico that are being manufactured down there, $2,000 per car, right?
[03:13:30.989 --> 03:13:33.989]  So that's going to make things more expensive, but people will change their habits.
[03:13:34.129 --> 03:13:39.690]  Now, there's something really important about these imports that we have to address.
[03:13:40.430 --> 03:13:48.270]  And that is, when you have a strong dollar, which is what we have right now, when Trump got elected, the dollar like exploded.
[03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:50.489]  It's like, oh my word, America's gonna be great again.
[03:13:50.850 --> 03:13:55.209]  When you have a strong dollar, it encourages imports, right?
[03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:59.190]  When you have a weak dollar, it encourages exports.
[03:13:59.659 --> 03:14:06.000]  So I think what's going to be coming under a Trump presidency is a weak dollar policy.
[03:14:06.100 --> 03:14:13.799]  Because when it's a weak dollar, it means other currencies, when they're buying American goods, they get basically relatively more.
[03:14:13.940 --> 03:14:17.680]  So a weak dollar policy will encourage American exports.
[03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:24.360]  And I think that's what's coming down the road, is a change in monetary policy from the Trump administration.
[03:14:24.540 --> 03:14:28.700]  And a weak dollar policy will propel things like gold and silver.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:52.340]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health, not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:53.280]  It's just all around us.
[03:14:53.620 --> 03:14:56.600]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[03:14:56.739 --> 03:15:05.500]  Bill Gates, Is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[03:15:05.739 --> 03:15:06.299]  It's insane.
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:12.719]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:21.659]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby.
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:23.520]  Ultimate gut cleanse.
[03:15:24.510 --> 03:15:26.850]  These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[03:15:27.069 --> 03:15:29.709]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:33.950]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:35.930]  This is amazing.
[03:15:36.090 --> 03:15:37.309]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[03:15:38.170 --> 03:15:44.850]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[03:15:45.639 --> 03:15:57.459]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:03.909]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is That's insane.
[03:16:04.030 --> 03:16:04.370]  Look it up.
[03:16:04.489 --> 03:16:06.870]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[03:16:07.129 --> 03:16:09.090]  It's got the trifecta going.
[03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:30.290]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, and you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[03:16:39.500 --> 03:16:46.260]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[03:16:46.559 --> 03:16:51.020]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:57.950]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[03:16:58.049 --> 03:17:01.190]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:03.790]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[03:17:04.049 --> 03:17:06.809]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:17:07.010 --> 03:17:10.510]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[03:17:11.030 --> 03:17:17.870]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[03:17:18.149 --> 03:17:21.530]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[03:17:21.690 --> 03:17:30.329]  We're taking the AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:34.469]  Infowars should be shut down in just a few weeks.
[03:17:34.709 --> 03:17:41.170]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[03:17:41.469 --> 03:17:45.069]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[03:17:45.329 --> 03:17:49.530]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:53.969]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[03:17:59.630 --> 03:18:00.930]  Cut that a few weeks ago.
[03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:02.930]  Now it's not a few weeks away, it's tomorrow.
[03:18:04.729 --> 03:18:05.930]  And let's just say this.
[03:18:06.069 --> 03:18:08.129]  We got news about this time yesterday.
[03:18:08.549 --> 03:18:10.290]  In fact, it was right at this time I was on air.
[03:18:12.010 --> 03:18:14.409]  That they've changed how the auction's working.
[03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:22.030]  And I'm going to wait and see what happens tomorrow.
[03:18:24.680 --> 03:18:28.959]  At 1030 Central, it's no longer an open auction.
[03:18:29.659 --> 03:18:32.700]  No longer can you see the high bid and outbid it.
[03:18:34.219 --> 03:18:37.420]  They just make you put a bid in and then whoever's the highest gets it.
[03:18:37.479 --> 03:18:38.540]  That's not an auction, is it?
[03:18:38.920 --> 03:18:40.559]  Why would you do something like that?
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:41.520]  We'll see.
[03:18:42.239 --> 03:18:43.860]  I'll reserve judgment on that.
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:51.500]  But if the globalists think shutting this building and taking this equipment away is going to stop us, I know how you operate.
[03:18:51.620 --> 03:18:52.500]  You're like me.
[03:18:54.620 --> 03:18:56.360]  I just do everything according to how I feel.
[03:18:56.559 --> 03:18:57.379]  I think people are like me.
[03:18:57.920 --> 03:18:59.100]  I think you like freedom.
[03:18:59.239 --> 03:19:00.079]  I think you hate tyrants.
[03:19:00.180 --> 03:19:01.340]  I think you want your children to be free.
[03:19:01.420 --> 03:19:02.540]  I think you don't like being bullied.
[03:19:03.100 --> 03:19:07.540]  I think you'll reject the New World Order and Klaus Schwab and King Charles and Bill Gates and Fauci.
[03:19:07.559 --> 03:19:08.299]  And you know what you did.
[03:19:08.579 --> 03:19:11.739]  And now the topics we cover are number one in the world because they're real.
[03:19:13.479 --> 03:19:18.959]  We talk about the real issues that everybody ignored for decades and now they're front and center because these are the real issues.
[03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:20.260]  Dr.
[03:19:20.379 --> 03:19:35.639]  Kirk Elliott, when you were on last week, on the eve of the election, eight days ago, I said, I predict when Trump wins, we'll see gold and silver go down for a while, but because of booming economies and what's happening in the currency and what they're saying that'll do to the dollar, which is already happening,
[03:19:36.100 --> 03:19:39.639]  that then it'll go up after that.
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:51.770]  And I think with the technicals, that's what you're saying right now, because the way world inflation works and what's going on, you can slow it, You can have the right kind that's from booming economy.
[03:19:52.909 --> 03:19:56.049]  But what you don't want is stagflation, a dead economy with the inflation.
[03:19:56.329 --> 03:20:03.610]  And where the world's going, you can't put genie back in the bottle, but you can have a good economy with some inflation.
[03:20:03.610 --> 03:20:04.850]  And I think that's what you're saying.
[03:20:05.290 --> 03:20:07.270]  Plus all the industrial uses for silver.
[03:20:07.450 --> 03:20:09.329]  I don't see silver doing anything but going up.
[03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:10.829]  That's my layman's view.
[03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:13.290]  Give us, as an economist, what you're saying is going to happen.
[03:20:14.850 --> 03:20:17.930]  Well, that's exactly what we said was going to happen.
[03:20:18.129 --> 03:20:25.809]  So when Trump got elected, it's this overreaction to a news story is what the markets always do.
[03:20:25.969 --> 03:20:33.829]  Whether it's a president or whether it's a war that starts or whether it's an interest rate decision, there's always an overreaction.
[03:20:34.209 --> 03:20:36.049]  And, you know, sometimes things go up too much.
[03:20:36.149 --> 03:20:37.370]  Sometimes they go down too much, right?
[03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:43.809]  That's what we saw Right after, you know, on day two of the election, right?
[03:20:43.930 --> 03:20:49.309]  It's like, okay, you saw gold and silver come down because the dollar was looking strong, like really strong.
[03:20:49.530 --> 03:20:51.690]  Well, that lasted for about a week.
[03:20:51.709 --> 03:21:01.750]  But even now today, right, you see, ooh, the markets are starting to peter out a little bit because Trump is going to do amazing things, Alex, for the domestic economy.
[03:21:01.889 --> 03:21:04.290]  He's going to do amazing things for America, right?
[03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:07.229]  The rest of the world, though, he didn't fix.
[03:21:07.389 --> 03:21:09.149]  He's not gonna fix, right?
[03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:11.629]  He's not gonna fix the commercial real estate in China.
[03:21:11.770 --> 03:21:21.069]  He's not gonna, and the huge implosion there, he's not gonna fix the multiple 10 trillion yuan stimulus that China needs to do.
[03:21:21.250 --> 03:21:28.909]  He's not gonna really be able to fix the huge global move towards central bank digital currency and the loss of freedom globally.
[03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:30.850]  Now he can do something here domestically, right?
[03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:36.590]  This is where I'm excited to be an American right now because there are going to be things changing.
[03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:40.590]  But when it's good for America, it might not be good for the rest of the world, right?
[03:21:40.690 --> 03:21:50.010]  But this is a sharp contrast to what Biden had, which was, you know what, Americans, you're secondary to the global agenda, right?
[03:21:50.139 --> 03:21:50.340]  Right?
[03:21:50.479 --> 03:21:51.760]  So this has all been flip-flopped.
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:53.840]  And so now the rest of the world is starting to squirm.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:22:05.239]  But you need a weak dollar to actually create our imports or our exports leaving the country to actually be more cost-effective to other countries wanting to buy them.
[03:22:05.520 --> 03:22:08.959]  See, there's this double-edged sword that's going to be happening.
[03:22:09.120 --> 03:22:12.680]  Number one, you put tariffs on foreign goods, that's going to cause some inflation.
[03:22:12.799 --> 03:22:21.620]  That's going to cause those other countries, Alex, To pay for our lifestyle, to pay for our expenditures, our everything that we have, right?
[03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:35.739]  And then when you incentivize American companies, you know, to give them subsidies, to make them even more competitive globally, and you do that with a weak dollar position, there's no stopping what America could do.
[03:22:35.899 --> 03:22:42.799]  So moving forward, this is the knee-jerk reaction to the Trump election, I think is about over.
[03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:47.729]  And the markets are saying, ooh, the global economy still isn't really very good.
[03:22:47.889 --> 03:22:48.950]  It's actually terrible.
[03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:51.469]  And those are the fundamentals that were causing things.
[03:22:51.649 --> 03:23:01.250]  So what now moving forward is, you know, I was listening to Max Keiser before I came on, and he was talking a lot about Bitcoin, which is awesome.
[03:23:01.350 --> 03:23:04.270]  I think he's dead on right on everything that he said.
[03:23:04.430 --> 03:23:10.079]  But you know what it takes is To actually mine Bitcoin, it takes a lot of silver in the circuit boards.
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:12.899]  It's a very energy consumption process.
[03:23:13.139 --> 03:23:19.620]  Like he's talking about Texas being the Bitcoin mining capital of America pretty much because of cheap energy.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:25.059]  All these circuits that are needed for this new crypto movement are going to take silver.
[03:23:25.260 --> 03:23:26.579]  Solar power takes silver.
[03:23:26.700 --> 03:23:28.239]  Electric vehicles take silver, right?
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:29.319]  The batteries take silver.
[03:23:29.440 --> 03:23:29.760]  It's like...
[03:23:30.219 --> 03:23:35.379]  What we're doing here is we're looking at the trends and where is the world headed, right?
[03:23:35.479 --> 03:23:39.079]  We're headed towards, you know, digital wallets and things of that nature.
[03:23:39.260 --> 03:23:44.559]  What is needed, you know, and the enhancement of battery technology and everything else.
[03:23:44.639 --> 03:23:56.860]  It's like we're on the cusp of being able to identify the things that are going to do really well moving forward in not just Trump's economy, but the global economy moving forward, right?
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.540]  So I would take this opportunity.
[03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:15.989]  I think?
[03:24:23.629 --> 03:24:30.090]  There's some priorities that he's talked about in his speeches and everything that he's talked about in his policy statements.
[03:24:30.430 --> 03:24:33.549]  Number one, he's going to have border security at the front.
[03:24:33.629 --> 03:24:38.489]  He's going to close the border and he's going to deport the people who are here illegally, right?
[03:24:38.690 --> 03:24:40.670]  Now, what is this going to do for the economy?
[03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:41.889]  Why am I talking about that?
[03:24:42.010 --> 03:24:42.750]  Isn't that a social thing?
[03:24:42.850 --> 03:24:43.969]  It's like, no, it's an economic thing.
[03:24:44.440 --> 03:24:54.799]  Because when you look at the bogus job numbers that even Ed Dowd is bringing up, it's like these numbers, we've never seen anything that's so bad.
[03:24:55.020 --> 03:25:03.540]  Most of the jobs, if not all of the jobs that have been created during the Biden administration have gone to non-Americans, Alex.
[03:25:04.219 --> 03:25:06.020]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:25:06.260 --> 03:25:08.719]  And this is what Trump is inheriting.
[03:25:08.879 --> 03:25:16.659]  He's also inheriting an economy and energy policy that's been handcuffed for so long.
[03:25:16.799 --> 03:25:23.819]  And this is why he says in, you know, when he was in Allentown, Pennsylvania on October 29th, He said, we're going to frack, frack, frack.
[03:25:23.879 --> 03:25:25.139]  We're going to drill, baby, drill, right?
[03:25:25.379 --> 03:25:26.299]  Why is that?
[03:25:26.440 --> 03:25:30.860]  Because he knows that we have been so dependent on foreign oil for so long.
[03:25:31.079 --> 03:25:32.979]  We've got something in America.
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:34.540]  We've got a lot of oil.
[03:25:34.659 --> 03:25:35.659]  We've got a lot of gas.
[03:25:35.799 --> 03:25:41.760]  We just have to remove the restrictions from being able to get to it cheaply, right?
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:45.000]  So we can be productive and prosperous again, right?
[03:25:45.139 --> 03:25:55.020]  So I think on day one, He's going to sign an executive order that would direct every federal agency to immediately remove every single burdensome regulation driving up the cost of goods.
[03:25:55.159 --> 03:26:03.520]  Because he knows that inflation is what caused people to really vote en masse, you know, and to regain our freedoms, right?
[03:26:03.700 --> 03:26:08.639]  So I think you're going to see a lot of changes there, and we have to.
[03:26:09.090 --> 03:26:20.049]  If we're dependent on foreign oil, and now because of the BRICS nations taking away the petrodollar and not trading in US dollars for oil, we're hosed.
[03:26:20.149 --> 03:26:27.250]  Because every time we would buy foreign oil, we're using their currencies instead of ours, building up their economy doubly.
[03:26:27.690 --> 03:26:32.750]  Not only are we buying Middle Eastern oil, but we're using BRICS currencies to do it.
[03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:35.049]  And we're gonna get back to that in a moment, but I gotta get this in while you're here.
[03:26:35.270 --> 03:26:43.040]  Trump came out, as you know, and said he's gonna cap The interest rate on credit cards at 10%.
[03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:44.739]  I put this out yesterday.
[03:26:44.899 --> 03:26:45.879]  It's got like 40 million views.
[03:26:45.979 --> 03:26:46.979]  People are really excited about this.
[03:26:47.059 --> 03:26:52.600]  But as an economist, I wanna get your take on what you think of this idea and what will happen if it's implemented here at us.
[03:26:57.479 --> 03:27:04.459]  And while working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates at 10%.
[03:27:04.459 --> 03:27:05.479]  We have no choice.
[03:27:05.899 --> 03:27:08.120]  They're getting 22, 25%.
[03:27:09.579 --> 03:27:18.360]  We can't let people have to pay 25% and 22% interest Because they can't afford to pay off their credit card.
[03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:20.739]  We're going to cap it for a period of time at 10%.
[03:27:20.739 --> 03:27:35.760]  We will terminate the Green News scam and spend the trillions and trillions of dollars of unspent dollars on roads, bridges, real infrastructure, and paying down debt, not fake infrastructure that has caused massive inflation,
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:36.940]  along with the energy.
[03:27:37.639 --> 03:27:39.620]  That bill was just a disaster.
[03:27:40.619 --> 03:27:41.600]  Trillions of dollars.
[03:27:41.799 --> 03:27:43.799]  That's what caused all of the inflation.
[03:27:44.799 --> 03:27:47.079]  So that's from back in September, but it went viral yesterday.
[03:27:47.079 --> 03:27:48.219]  What do you make of that statement?
[03:27:49.059 --> 03:27:53.760]  So what that's going to do is stimulate the economy a lot because you look at all of the debt.
[03:27:53.879 --> 03:27:57.559]  There's over a trillion dollars in credit card debt, right?
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:28:04.600]  So when people are handcuffed with debt, and I'm not saying that I'm encouraging people to be in debt.
[03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:06.379]  No, I want people to get out of debt, right?
[03:28:06.659 --> 03:28:17.680]  But when you cap that interest rate, And if it goes to 10%, and some of these credit cards are 22% to 25%, you're basically cutting in half people's payments.
[03:28:17.860 --> 03:28:26.500]  Now they're going to start to being able to either A, pay off their debt, and B, more financially stable, or spend more money, right?
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:28.440]  So this is going to grow the economy.
[03:28:28.559 --> 03:28:32.579]  But you look at what Jerome Powell has done when he lowered interest rates.
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:34.540]  What happened to mortgage rates, Alex?
[03:28:34.799 --> 03:28:35.799]  They've gone up.
[03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.750]  Why?
[03:28:36.909 --> 03:28:41.450]  Because under Biden's economy, people aren't working, right?
[03:28:41.549 --> 03:28:47.290]  So who cares if the federal funds rate came down a quarter of a point or half a point like it did last month?
[03:28:47.909 --> 03:28:55.479]  Banks, when they lend out money to people, especially in the mortgages, they're saying, hmm, I've got this person.
[03:28:55.479 --> 03:28:58.420]  I don't know if they're going to have a job 30 years from now.
[03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:03.120]  And we're basically going to give out a big lump sum so they can buy a house.
[03:29:03.239 --> 03:29:05.239]  And we're expecting to get paid off.
[03:29:05.579 --> 03:29:10.659]  Nobody knows what the world is going to look like 30 years from now or 20 or 10 or even next week, really.
[03:29:11.260 --> 03:29:20.020]  So what are these underneath this economy and the things changing and the inflationary pressures and this global debt spiral that we're in?
[03:29:21.680 --> 03:29:28.579]  We're going to raise mortgage rates, even though the Fed is lowering them because banks are lending their own money.
[03:29:28.959 --> 03:29:32.799]  And they need to say, we need a reward for the risk that we're taking, right?
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:47.389]  So what Trump is going to do by capping that Is gonna say, okay, America, you actually take this chance, this opportunity I'm giving you to pay down your debt more quickly or spend, right?
[03:29:47.530 --> 03:29:51.750]  Or whatever they're gonna do, they're gonna have extra money left at the end of every month.
[03:29:51.930 --> 03:29:57.110]  And if people were smart, they'd pay off their debt because interest rates won't stay low forever, right?
[03:29:57.309 --> 03:30:09.379]  So, you know, when you look at why interest rates won't stay low forever, Is because we've got a global inflationary crisis that's about to hit Trump.
[03:30:10.020 --> 03:30:16.040]  It's not his fault, but he's going to be the guy carrying the bag when this global economy starts to melt down.
[03:30:16.260 --> 03:30:18.979]  So I was reading this article on Financial Times.
[03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:24.340]  And in Japan, they're concerned about tariffs.
[03:30:24.520 --> 03:30:35.459]  They're concerned about everything that's going to be happening in this carry trade because the Bank of Japan, their governor, so what is the yen carry trade?
[03:30:35.639 --> 03:30:39.739]  The yen carry trade has been going on for about 20 years, Alex.
[03:30:39.979 --> 03:30:44.590]  So where they've had negative interest rates, Or 0% interest rates.
[03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:59.790]  So if you're a big hedge fund, if you're a company or a country, and you say, I'm going to basically give Japan money, and I'm going to get a 0% interest rate for that, take that money, and you could go into a European Treasury bond, a US Treasury something, maybe get 4%.
[03:30:59.790 --> 03:31:02.629]  That's like a risk-free money, right?
[03:31:02.670 --> 03:31:05.250]  You're borrowing at zero, and you're putting into something that's risk-free.
[03:31:05.430 --> 03:31:07.090]  So what's happening in Japan?
[03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:18.170]  Right, so their inflation is so much, and they're knowing, they know that with tariffs that Trump is gonna put on the world, that they're gonna sell less stuff.
[03:31:18.350 --> 03:31:20.590]  Now they're entering into a fiscal cliff.
[03:31:20.829 --> 03:31:26.959]  They're gonna have to raise interest rates To actually attract more foreign capital going into the end.
[03:31:27.100 --> 03:31:28.219]  So what is that going to do?
[03:31:28.360 --> 03:31:37.299]  It's going to kill the global financing arm that's caused the global growth for the last 20 years has been the yen carry trade, right?
[03:31:37.399 --> 03:31:40.479]  Okay, so here's something that I was thinking about just this morning.
[03:31:40.639 --> 03:31:42.559]  It's like that's happening in Japan.
[03:31:42.799 --> 03:31:47.239]  They have to lower rates to attract more capital coming into their currency.
[03:31:47.719 --> 03:31:53.620]  Or you could raise interest rates to give people a higher reward for coming into their currency.
[03:31:53.680 --> 03:31:54.780]  See, how could you do both?
[03:31:55.040 --> 03:31:57.920]  If people are investing in something, they want a higher yield.
[03:31:58.040 --> 03:31:59.239]  They want a bigger interest rate.
[03:31:59.520 --> 03:32:10.260]  However, when you're so big and you have such low interest rates, that carry trade caused a lot of capital to go into Japan that they were able to use, and they did that with zero interest rates.
[03:32:10.440 --> 03:32:12.959]  So moving forward, what is the Fed going to do?
[03:32:13.360 --> 03:32:16.139]  I pray that Trump abolishes the stinking Fed.
[03:32:16.959 --> 03:32:26.879]  But with what we have right now, and this is maybe why Jerome Powell and Trump seem to be at odds, and Powell says, you can't actually get rid of me.
[03:32:26.920 --> 03:32:28.000]  You can't ask me to resign.
[03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:33.280]  And if you did, I'm not going to, because it's unconstitutional or some garbage, right?
[03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:37.559]  And by the way, since you mentioned that, let's play the short clip in case people missed this last week.
[03:32:37.659 --> 03:32:38.239]  It is private.
[03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:40.989]  He's right, Congress could abolish it though.
[03:32:41.209 --> 03:32:44.770]  The Federal Reserve Act 1913, Mother Rothschild, it's time to get rid of it.
[03:32:45.129 --> 03:32:46.870]  I'm glad he's having a conversation from Trump.
[03:32:46.989 --> 03:32:48.389]  This is gonna backfire, here it is.
[03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:51.610]  Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico.
[03:32:52.590 --> 03:32:57.129]  Some of the president elect's advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[03:32:57.510 --> 03:32:59.889]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[03:33:00.450 --> 03:33:00.690]  No.
[03:33:01.909 --> 03:33:07.409]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:08.110]  No.
[03:33:12.569 --> 03:33:13.250]  Total arrogance.
[03:33:13.729 --> 03:33:14.729]  We're out of time.
[03:33:16.049 --> 03:33:20.450]  60-second summation here, Kirk Elliott, and then everybody needs to use this opportunity to get silver.
[03:33:21.409 --> 03:33:24.469]  Obviously, gold at some point, even though it's way up, not as much as silver.
[03:33:24.530 --> 03:33:26.770]  You believe silver has more to grow just because of the industrial reasons.
[03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:28.530]  I believe it's a great move for everybody.
[03:33:28.850 --> 03:33:32.989]  KEPM.com forward slash gold, 720-605-3900.
[03:33:32.989 --> 03:33:35.229]  If you're going to get silver and gold, this is the place.
[03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:38.469]  720-605-3900.
[03:33:38.709 --> 03:33:40.010]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:33:40.270 --> 03:33:44.409]  And the stock market's definitely in crazy town with what Warren Buffett's doing.
[03:33:44.629 --> 03:33:46.469]  People can roll over those IRAs right now.
[03:33:46.569 --> 03:33:47.290]  That's the big thing.
[03:33:47.350 --> 03:33:48.030]  People need to call you.
[03:33:49.170 --> 03:33:54.729]  Yeah, they need to call, take advantage of this price reduction that we're seeing in gold and silver right now, the knee-jerk reaction.
[03:33:55.010 --> 03:33:57.170]  Trump is going to do amazing things for the economy.
[03:33:57.309 --> 03:34:04.409]  What he inherited is a global economy that he had nothing to do with that's in an inflationary spiral.
[03:34:04.690 --> 03:34:09.409]  That will cause all commodities to go up a lot, right?
[03:34:09.569 --> 03:34:14.790]  So I still expect silver to be $50 by the end of the year or first part of next.
[03:34:15.049 --> 03:34:15.909]  And you know what?
[03:34:16.069 --> 03:34:17.149]  So does Goldman Sachs.
[03:34:17.569 --> 03:34:22.549]  You know, they just did a report this morning that they're expecting $50 silver in early 2025.
[03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:25.149]  Take advantage of that growth.
[03:34:25.270 --> 03:34:28.129]  Give us a call and we'll help you navigate through it.
[03:34:28.209 --> 03:34:31.629]  But with your IRAs, where people don't think, I don't have any money to invest.
[03:34:31.989 --> 03:34:34.409]  Your IRAs, they're portable.
[03:34:34.729 --> 03:34:36.989]  Move them into physical gold and silver.
[03:34:37.170 --> 03:34:40.270]  Take advantage of these trends so the trends don't take advantage of you.
[03:34:40.620 --> 03:34:41.319]  So simple.
[03:34:41.540 --> 03:34:45.379]  KPM.com forward slash gold 720-605-3900.
[03:34:45.559 --> 03:34:46.040]  Dr.
[03:34:46.180 --> 03:34:47.319]  Elliott, we got Trump in.
[03:34:47.479 --> 03:34:49.520]  Now we got to get him into office and turn this around.
[03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:50.280]  God bless you.
[03:34:50.860 --> 03:34:51.360]  God bless.
[03:34:51.479 --> 03:34:51.739]  Thank you.
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:53.479]  All right.
[03:34:53.579 --> 03:34:56.420]  We've got six minutes left till Owen Schroer takes over.
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:00.639]  We can be shut down by the time he goes on air at 3 p.m.
[03:35:00.719 --> 03:35:00.920]  tomorrow.
[03:35:01.459 --> 03:35:03.420]  The auction's there, forced.
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:05.000]  It's not about the money.
[03:35:05.280 --> 03:35:06.479]  The Sandy Hook people don't want money.
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:07.479]  It's Democrat Party run.
[03:35:07.579 --> 03:35:08.639]  The FBI created the suits.
[03:35:08.739 --> 03:35:09.459]  That came out in court.
[03:35:09.620 --> 03:35:11.020]  The CIA got caught being involved.
[03:35:11.620 --> 03:35:12.739]  It's all the law fairs.
[03:35:12.799 --> 03:35:13.760]  Same stuff targeting Trump.
[03:35:13.940 --> 03:35:15.600]  They thought they could get me off the air.
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:19.459]  That would stop the awakening because now you've got Elon Musk and everybody else to deal with and Joe Rogan.
[03:35:19.540 --> 03:35:19.959]  Good luck.
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:20.920]  They're failing.
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:22.180]  The globalists are losing.
[03:35:22.379 --> 03:35:24.239]  But this is aftermath of their attack.
[03:35:25.219 --> 03:35:28.299]  It's like we're winning the war, but they're trying to destroy InfoWars right now.
[03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:36.530]  So, follow us at the Alex Jones Network at AJNLive on X. Support the sponsors, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:35:36.610 --> 03:35:37.629]  That's separate from InfoWars.
[03:35:37.870 --> 03:35:42.010]  But whatever you do, your word of mouth, letting folks know where we are, what's happening is key.
[03:35:42.069 --> 03:35:43.389]  But let me just show you what's happening.
[03:35:43.709 --> 03:35:44.829]  It's all over the news.
[03:35:45.069 --> 03:35:46.750]  It was all over CNN, you name it.
[03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:49.870]  InfoWars will be auctioned off this week to pay Sandy Hook families.
[03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:51.049]  No, they didn't want money.
[03:35:51.149 --> 03:35:52.030]  They didn't want a settlement.
[03:35:52.170 --> 03:35:53.250]  There's no money in the company.
[03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:55.250]  There's no money in the equipment to speak of.
[03:35:55.450 --> 03:35:56.530]  They want to be shut down.
[03:35:56.649 --> 03:35:57.329]  They said that in court.
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:35:59.420]  That's what this is all about.
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:02.739]  Continuing, Alex Jones says InfoWars might be shut down.
[03:36:02.860 --> 03:36:03.959]  Everything being auctioned off.
[03:36:04.079 --> 03:36:04.440]  Newsweek.
[03:36:05.139 --> 03:36:05.840]  Daily Mail.
[03:36:06.139 --> 03:36:09.399]  Alex Jones reveals InfoWars may shut down as its assets are auctioned off.
[03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:11.100]  Repay Sandy Hook families.
[03:36:11.239 --> 03:36:12.159]  I did nothing to them.
[03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:14.059]  Adam Lanza killed their kid.
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:15.299]  I was found guilty by judges.
[03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:16.200]  They had to show trials.
[03:36:16.319 --> 03:36:18.260]  They raised money off me saying I was victimizing them.
[03:36:18.459 --> 03:36:19.500]  I did nothing to them.
[03:36:20.540 --> 03:36:24.420]  Alex Jones says InfoWars might be shut down unless good guys buy the platform.
[03:36:25.290 --> 03:36:28.670]  Alex Jones freaks out as he prepares to lose his entire empire.
[03:36:28.989 --> 03:36:29.370]  Yeah.
[03:36:29.770 --> 03:36:31.190]  My voice is bigger than ever.
[03:36:31.329 --> 03:36:32.409]  People know I've been on target.
[03:36:33.370 --> 03:36:35.209]  Our supporters are there for us.
[03:36:35.729 --> 03:36:36.569]  It's ridiculous.
[03:36:36.569 --> 03:36:42.870]  But I do want to say a prayer about Infowars and about what we've done in 30-plus years on air.
[03:36:42.969 --> 03:36:46.450]  Since 1997, I've had Infowars itself, but I was on air in 94.
[03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:49.409]  Before that, we're in God's hands.
[03:36:49.569 --> 03:36:55.680]  And whatever happens with this auction and whatever goes on with the skullduggery, It's a serious concern.
[03:36:56.219 --> 03:36:57.620]  It's in God's hands.
[03:36:57.799 --> 03:36:59.639]  And the victory is getting Trump in.
[03:36:59.739 --> 03:37:01.860]  And the victory is that we never backed down and never gave up.
[03:37:02.219 --> 03:37:03.739]  And that we're going to continue on.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.079]  Fight, fight, fight is what this is all about.
[03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:10.059]  And having an indomitable, dauntless, stalwart spirit.
[03:37:10.479 --> 03:37:13.280]  And so it has been an incredible blessing to know the crew.
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:15.420]  An incredible blessing to know the audience.
[03:37:15.579 --> 03:37:17.500]  An incredible blessing to interview all these amazing guests.
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:19.959]  And our reporters and our researchers.
[03:37:20.780 --> 03:37:21.180]  And...
[03:37:22.129 --> 03:37:22.909]  This is a family.
[03:37:23.209 --> 03:37:30.690]  And I'm going to do my best to keep everybody working and continuing on with whatever comes to the future, whether good guys buy it or not.
[03:37:30.850 --> 03:37:32.129]  I will never back down.
[03:37:32.250 --> 03:37:33.889]  I will never waver or falter.
[03:37:34.090 --> 03:37:35.469]  I will never lie to you.
[03:37:35.569 --> 03:37:37.489]  I get things wrong occasionally, and I'll tell you what I am.
[03:37:38.129 --> 03:37:43.889]  And I'm just here to tell you that I'm extremely blessed and honored to have been part of this.
[03:37:43.989 --> 03:37:45.170]  And this is all a group effort.
[03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:48.049]  And it's just so amazing.
[03:37:48.090 --> 03:37:49.329]  And I just want to say a prayer.
[03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:55.010]  Dear Heavenly Father, you have blessed us with free will and consciousness in life.
[03:37:55.329 --> 03:37:58.049]  We thank you for our ancestors and all the struggles they went through.
[03:37:58.170 --> 03:38:00.569]  We thank you for everybody fighting for freedom and justice today.
[03:38:00.569 --> 03:38:04.889]  And we pray for the children in sex slavery and slave bondage here and around the world.
[03:38:04.969 --> 03:38:08.770]  And we pray that President Trump takes that as one of the main issues.
[03:38:08.770 --> 03:38:15.290]  And not just deporting the illegal aliens and the criminals, but going after the traffickers and the NGOs and Soros and the rest of them.
[03:38:15.329 --> 03:38:17.590]  Because that's justice that we find the children and we free them.
[03:38:18.489 --> 03:38:27.010]  I pray that you just lead God and direct me to make the right decisions and that your spirit come into me strong and tell me what to do so that I can make better decisions.
[03:38:27.270 --> 03:38:43.909]  And I pray that you lift up our crew and all of our supporters in strength and that you bring us peace and justice and lift the blinders off the eyes and the souls and the minds and the hearts of people that are in bondage and the crazy left and the cult they're in.
[03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:47.430]  And we just pray that your Holy Spirit come to them and they open their hearts and they be healed.
[03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:54.149]  We're good to go.
[03:39:13.380 --> 03:39:36.430]  Humbly tell you that I repent for anything I've done and the mistakes I've made and I just want to do a better job and I just love you and I see your hand in everything and it's so beautiful and so wonderful and I thank you for the gift of life, the gift of consciousness and I just pray that your will be done and I pray that everyone pray to you and that we all come together and just ask what do you want God and that your will be done as it is In heaven,
[03:39:36.690 --> 03:39:37.989]  right here on earth.
[03:39:38.489 --> 03:39:43.690]  And again, I just thank you and worship you and just do not have words to describe it.
[03:39:43.729 --> 03:39:51.069]  Just feel my heart and feel my love for you and everything you've done and how you raised me up as a wicked person to be an instrument against the enemy.
[03:39:51.170 --> 03:39:57.290]  And I am so blessed and just so amazed and just blown away by your love and your justice and your power.
[03:39:57.549 --> 03:39:58.870]  And you are the King of Kings.
[03:39:59.010 --> 03:39:59.809]  You are the Lord of Lords.
[03:39:59.930 --> 03:40:00.909]  You are the creator of the universe.
[03:40:01.049 --> 03:40:02.069]  You are everything.
[03:40:02.459 --> 03:40:10.959]  And we just love you and we appreciate you and we thank you in your wonderful son that you sent to us to save us.
[03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:12.520]  Name, Jesus Christ.
[03:40:13.540 --> 03:40:14.139]  Amen.
[03:40:19.299 --> 03:40:20.260]  Here we are.
[03:40:21.739 --> 03:40:23.780]  And whatever happens, it's God's will.
[03:40:24.219 --> 03:40:30.040]  And we are victorious and we will continue on because our God is the God of the universe.
[03:40:31.579 --> 03:40:32.840]  I want to, again, thank the crew.
[03:40:33.020 --> 03:40:34.260]  I want to thank the supporters.
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:36.620]  I want to thank the viewers and listeners, the activists in the field.
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:38.940]  It's been an incredible journey.
[03:40:39.059 --> 03:40:39.780]  We've all learned together.
[03:40:40.399 --> 03:40:42.479]  And that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[03:40:42.700 --> 03:40:49.420]  So I'm going to leave here now and go to the backup studio, and hopefully it's not needed, and it's, you know, there, and we can work out of there.
[03:40:49.479 --> 03:40:50.540]  There's great stuff there as well.
[03:40:51.079 --> 03:40:52.299]  We survive this.
[03:40:52.420 --> 03:40:53.819]  We'll roll this into the operations.
[03:40:54.299 --> 03:40:55.840]  But I pledge the enemy this.
[03:40:57.079 --> 03:40:59.299]  I have never been stronger in the Lord.
[03:40:59.479 --> 03:41:09.819]  And I promise you that if you think you have faced resistance so far, we're bringing the victory in the name of Jesus Christ.
[03:41:11.020 --> 03:41:12.239]  God bless you all.
[03:41:22.849 --> 03:41:26.149]  We brought in a lot of money at the yellowstonestore.com to our sponsor.
[03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:27.370]  And they're great guys.
[03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:28.110]  They're great marketers.
[03:41:28.250 --> 03:41:28.629]  They're bigly.
[03:41:28.729 --> 03:41:33.149]  They produce the best Trump shirts and are big sponsors for Steven Crowder and the Hodge twins and so many others.
[03:41:33.809 --> 03:41:36.469]  I had little talks with them though because I see the numbers.
[03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:39.950]  I'm like, you're selling the CMOS for 55% off.
[03:41:40.569 --> 03:41:43.489]  And then you give VIP members another discount?
[03:41:43.709 --> 03:41:44.790]  And I go, let me see the numbers.
[03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:48.530]  Oh, actually, some of these deals we lose money, but we're getting new customers.
[03:41:48.549 --> 03:41:49.069]  They're going to love it.
[03:41:49.069 --> 03:41:49.530]  I'm like...
[03:41:50.629 --> 03:41:56.569]  Okay, let's have a couple fundraiser t-shirts that are 50 bucks so we actually, you know, get 20-something bucks.
[03:41:57.750 --> 03:41:59.049]  You know, after all the cost.
[03:41:59.250 --> 03:42:00.950]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying.
[03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:02.829]  So, I had an idea two weeks ago.
[03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:05.129]  We'll do a wide shot so you can see these.
[03:42:05.649 --> 03:42:14.110]  And I said, okay, I want a red on black classic InfoWars that says 1776 worldwide, 2024, my signature.
[03:42:15.209 --> 03:42:22.350]  Historic, looks great in your office, great wherever, you know you support us, whatever happens to InfoWars that survives is even cooler, doesn't survive, you've got the memento, and it helps fund the future.
[03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:26.100]  An Alex Jones style Star Wars fun thing we came up with.
[03:42:26.340 --> 03:42:30.600]  And then the other thing I designed, white on black InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[03:42:31.059 --> 03:42:31.819]  It's right there.
[03:42:32.100 --> 03:42:34.139]  There are only a few thousand of each one of these.
[03:42:34.260 --> 03:42:35.159]  They're limited edition.
[03:42:35.920 --> 03:42:38.879]  This is literally you knowing you back to the second American Revolution.
[03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:39.899]  It's such a critical time.
[03:42:40.079 --> 03:42:43.420]  While we've gone over the top, while we have the initiative, while this is all happening.
[03:42:43.860 --> 03:42:49.059]  So these things cost like $5 to print because they are high quality and they're on like a poster boards.
[03:42:49.200 --> 03:42:49.840]  They're thick.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:50.319]  They're nice.
[03:42:50.479 --> 03:42:51.540]  It's like a particularly good movie poster.
[03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:57.190]  And then the tube and all that's like six, seven bucks, eight bucks per unit.
[03:42:57.750 --> 03:43:06.069]  With 50 bucks, you know, we're getting like, you know, they get parved for other operations, but we're getting 20-something bucks for each poster for the operation.
[03:43:06.329 --> 03:43:12.909]  So if folks just go buy the posters, if people buy them right now, you'll hear me when I come back on Sunday and Monday.
[03:43:12.989 --> 03:43:14.690]  I won't be up here, please, please help me, help me, help me.
[03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:18.709]  If you go get those, we'll have the money and some runway out a few months.
[03:43:20.440 --> 03:43:21.260]  But the legal and everything else.
[03:43:21.399 --> 03:43:24.180]  So, if you want to keep the show on the air, this is the action point.
[03:43:25.420 --> 03:43:32.959]  TheAlexJonesStore.com And all the supplements are great, and all the t-shirts are great, and just, you know, everything's amazing.
[03:43:33.959 --> 03:43:43.379]  It's just when they're selling a t-shirt for 25, 30 bucks, and the t-shirt costs $15, or if it's an XXXL, $17, and then they've got their expenses, and their crew, and the legal, and all this stuff, and then we...
[03:43:43.379 --> 03:43:45.940]  Not a lot of money.
[03:43:46.840 --> 03:43:50.680]  So, these are the things you get If you really want to support us.
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:52.600]  And all the Trump gears in, it's amazing.
[03:43:52.739 --> 03:43:53.200]  Trump won.
[03:43:53.579 --> 03:43:54.959]  These are the best designs out there.
[03:43:55.020 --> 03:43:55.959]  I'm proud of these guys.
[03:43:56.180 --> 03:43:57.360]  I love the work they're doing.
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:43:59.940]  And it's all there.
[03:44:00.559 --> 03:44:03.799]  So the AlexJonesStore.com, three limited edition posters.
[03:44:04.399 --> 03:44:06.180]  I designed the red one and the white one.
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:08.040]  I mean, I've literally made those.
[03:44:08.399 --> 03:44:09.579]  And they're similar.
[03:44:09.719 --> 03:44:11.020]  They're very strong, very clean.
[03:44:11.920 --> 03:44:13.700]  It's my original design for the InfoWars logo.
[03:44:14.479 --> 03:44:16.459]  And then the middle one, I said, why don't we have a Star Wars one?
[03:44:16.860 --> 03:44:23.000]  Kind of a fun thing, you know, for somebody, like, if you've got a little arcade in your house with video games or pool table or whatever.
[03:44:25.139 --> 03:44:28.879]  I used to have a bigger house, but I don't have a room for a pool table now, but if I did, that'd be hanging in my house.
[03:44:28.959 --> 03:44:29.360]  That's fun.
[03:44:30.559 --> 03:44:32.260]  And so, it's all there.
[03:44:32.520 --> 03:44:33.500]  To me, it's a no-brainer.
[03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:35.760]  I want to thank you respectfully for everything you've done.
[03:44:36.100 --> 03:44:38.079]  I want to thank God for leading, guiding, directing.
[03:44:38.200 --> 03:44:38.459]  It's been incredible.
[03:44:38.540 --> 03:44:40.579]  I want to thank the crew for putting up with me, because...
[03:44:41.549 --> 03:44:42.229]  They understand.
[03:44:42.350 --> 03:44:43.569]  But I've been a jerk lately.
[03:44:43.569 --> 03:44:44.110]  I'll admit it.
[03:44:44.229 --> 03:44:44.889]  I try to repent.
[03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:46.229]  I try to not be so angry.
[03:44:46.409 --> 03:44:47.350]  But this is our whole future.
[03:44:47.450 --> 03:44:47.790]  They get it.
[03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:48.530]  They're pissed off too.
[03:44:48.909 --> 03:44:49.870]  They've been busting their ass.
[03:44:50.069 --> 03:44:57.329]  And I'd sure like to not just, whether we survive or have to set up a new operation, it'd be nice to give these guys a bonus and maybe a raise.
[03:44:57.430 --> 03:44:59.610]  They haven't had bonuses or raises in over two years.
[03:44:59.790 --> 03:45:01.069]  And they're a badass team.
[03:45:01.069 --> 03:45:01.829]  So I salute them.
[03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:05.549]  So for all of us here at the Infowars family, whatever happens, it's all in God's plan.
[03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:06.690]  But God works through you.
[03:45:06.770 --> 03:45:09.530]  So take action now and be part of the fundraiser.
[03:45:09.670 --> 03:45:10.729]  Get the posters now.
