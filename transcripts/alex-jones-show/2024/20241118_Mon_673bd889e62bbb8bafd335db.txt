[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.689]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.870]  It's Monday, November 18th, 2024.
[00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.949]  This is a Maximum Nuclear War alert.
[00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.030]  Maximum Nuclear War alert.
[00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.780]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:58.039]  Emblematic of the collapsing, rotting globalist establishment, Joe Biden yesterday authorized heavy, long-range, precision, nuclear-capable missiles to begin raining down inside Russia, which Putin has said will be an act of war and that Russia will be officially at war with the United States when Biden first floated it two and a half months ago.
[00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.310]  Biden made the authorization at 2 p.m.
[00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:05.409]  Central yesterday.
[00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.969]  And then he went out and gave a speech in the rainforest and wandered off into the forest.
[00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.390]  He couldn't even talk at the podium.
[00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.209]  Mitch McConnell now gave a press conference and could not talk.
[00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.790]  That's who's in charge.
[00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:31.250]  Trying to start World War III. And on the set doctrines of Russia and the United States, we both have the exact same doctrines when it comes to this.
[00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.349]  If you bring long-range hypersonic missiles...
[00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.310]  We're good to go.
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.990]  These policies are important for people like the Hollywood set that have come out, Sean Penn, a few years ago, and said, let's have nuclear weapons on the table.
[00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.990]  Let's go ahead and use them.
[00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.729]  Well, you can't do that, dumbass, because it's all been wargamed by everybody, and it always ends the same.
[00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.889]  It's called MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD, because you'd have to be mad to do it.
[00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.860]  Of course, we're showing you footage here of atomic bombs in the 50s.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:50.020]  Those are tinker toys compared to bombs that are thousands of times more powerful than what was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.840]  So I've been following this very closely.
[00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.139]  You're going to get the best coverage here.
[00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.840]  I don't know when in it.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.319]  These are going to start raining down on Russia.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:12.000]  Today, tomorrow, next week, but it's clearly to destabilize things with 62 days left until President Trump gets into office and stops all this madness.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.360]  Now, Trump has come out and said we need to have an immediate ceasefire.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.539]  Zelensky and Putin immediately need to go to the table, and this needs to stop now.
[00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.340]  We'll play that coming up.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.879]  But this is absolute, total insanity.
[00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.819]  Don Jr.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.879]  came out last night.
[00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.509]  And said the exact same thing I was saying last night.
[00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.650]  This is clearly the deep state trying to destabilize things.
[00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:49.150]  Alexander Soros says this is great news that heavy missiles are going to start raining down on top of Russian military targets in cities.
[00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.110]  Absolute, total lunatic land.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.780]  But what have I been saying?
[00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:03.439]  Their main move, not just civil unrest, not just cyber attacks they wave on Russia, not just false flags that they, quote, Trump supporters attack minorities.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.439]  They've pre-programmed all that.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.400]  It's attack Russia, and then when Russia attacks back, at least escalate the war.
[00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.080]  They've got the drafts ready.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.699]  They've got civil emergencies ready.
[00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.689]  That's the lesser of two evils.
[00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.029]  Or just total nuclear war.
[00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.430]  Which is, all the mainline experts agree with me, we're the closest to nuclear war ever.
[00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.149]  I'll show you all the articles, the statements.
[00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.370]  This is bunker town.
[00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.209]  This is the craziest thing in my 50 years on earth, by far, I've ever seen.
[00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.490]  And everybody else agrees.
[00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:45.839]  I mean, and Russia says this, just the authorization, they are now at war with the United States and NATO. I can show you that from CNN. So it's all coming up.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.480]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.000]  You think the deep state was just going to go away?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.019]  Nope, they're going to start World War III unless we stop them.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.300]  We'll talk about how we do that.
[00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:59.379]  Well, you heard last Thursday that we were thrown out of the building and that the Onion had bought Infowars.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.699]  That was on November 14th.
[00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.540]  Here we are, Monday, November 18th.
[00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:06.889]  2024, and look!
[00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.810]  For all the TV viewers, I'm in the Infowar studios.
[00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:14.870]  It was all a lie.
[00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:16.750]  It was all a fraud.
[00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.029]  And major lawsuits have been filed in federal court over this today.
[00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.230]  Three of them.
[00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.310]  That's just a start.
[00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.129]  We're on the offense.
[00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:33.410]  They have been caught absolutely red-handed.
[00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:40.959]  But that is not going to be what we mainly cover here today, obviously.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.540]  It's a big window into the deep state lawfare.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:58.339]  The Trump Justice Department has, that's forming, has said they are, we're already planning to go into the Justice Department division of bankruptcy and some of the incredible persecution of conservatives they've done, not just to me.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.980]  Folks don't seem to understand that they appoint federal trustees from the Justice Department in bankruptcies if they choose.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.459]  I have been tortured by these people for two years.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.819]  They literally tried to find something to put me in jail.
[00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.040]  When that didn't happen, they tried to manufacture it.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.879]  The judge fired the last guy on June 14th.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.319]  The new guy came in a few months ago.
[00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.930]  Had a fake auction that the judge had unauthorized.
[00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.129]  He had said, yes, there could be an auction in the future.
[00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.110]  We have to have hearings about it.
[00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.730]  It has to be set up.
[00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:32.269]  It has to be public.
[00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:36.009]  They had a private secret sale that was not an auction.
[00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:51.230]  And then they attached to the documents that we just got Thursday night that my lawyers asked me how to get into until it was filed, which it is now, admitting how they rigged it all.
[00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.290]  As if if they admitted it, it was okay.
[00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:53.930]  So...
[00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.790]  Unprecedented.
[00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.569]  The biggest, complete, absolute slam dunk ever.
[00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:00.490]  100% bed rigging.
[00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.009]  100% fraud.
[00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.329]  100% in your face.
[00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.410]  And I guess they just think they can hang their hat on.
[00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:08.490]  Well, it's dead kids.
[00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.189]  I mean, Alex Jones killed the kids at Sandy Hook, so they even sat on...
[00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:17.209]  Friday on Good Morning America, well, how can you win if you got a lower bid and how does this happen?
[00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.410]  Well, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.850]  We're allowed to do what we want.
[00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.610]  No, you're not.
[00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:22.269]  I'm not the villain you say I am.
[00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:24.850]  And even if I was, you don't get to do that.
[00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.110]  So it's just a window into the arrogance or the desperateness, a mixture of the two of these people.
[00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.509]  I mean, look at these mainstream headlines.
[00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:41.189]  P.A. Dems attempting to steal Senate election may end up in some serious legal trouble.
[00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:42.990]  They've already arrested people.
[00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.379]  That got up on TV and said, we're counting illegal alien votes.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  We don't care.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.860]  Trump's a tyrant.
[00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:58.980]  And so we're just going to count these votes of illegal aliens and other people that weren't registered voters.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.040]  And so now they're being arrested.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.500]  That's a large stack.
[00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.060]  And videos of them at the county commission saying, we don't care.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.779]  We'll do whatever we want.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.399]  We don't follow the law because Trump's bad.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.959]  I played it last night.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.100]  Literally, we don't follow the law.
[00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.470]  Okay.
[00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:26.629]  So, it's just part and parcel of the foaming at the mouth, chickens with the heads cut off, just running around wildly.
[00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.449]  And...
[00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:33.919]  It's crazy.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:47.220]  If you want to read one of the big federal court filings, fraudulent sale of info wars exposed in major federal court filing, the full filing, the exhibits, the bid exhibits where it wasn't a bid, where they admit before the auction they fixed the bid.
[00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.100]  Oh, the highest bid didn't win.
[00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.120]  The best one did, the U.S. trustee said.
[00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.240]  So he just says he has the authority.
[00:08:55.539 --> 00:09:01.500]  The judge said a whole bunch of times at the hearing last Thursday that Elon Musk lawyers joined, and if they've joined on my side...
[00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:07.259]  The judge said, you exceed your authority.
[00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:09.080]  I didn't say you could even have this auction yet.
[00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.480]  And what the hell is this?
[00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:12.279]  Well, who's the winning bid then?
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.179]  How much was the winning bid?
[00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:14.200]  He goes, I can't tell you how much.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.039]  The judge goes, you can't tell me how much the winners paid?
[00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:21.039]  Of course, he did know what they paid.
[00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:24.679]  And that's the other big issue that's so huge.
[00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:42.120]  They pledged my future earnings to buy my company in stuff that's on appeal that under law you can't pledge as money.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.059]  So they don't have a lot of explaining to do.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.860]  It's all cut and dry.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.860]  And Musk has said he will defend in major free speech cases because if you don't have free speech, one person, nobody does.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.360]  It's important.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.139]  It's coming up.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.519]  But first, let me get into the big news.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.019]  Yesterday at 2 p.m.
[00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:11.419]  Central, 3 p.m.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:27.379]  Eastern, the New York Times published an article that the White House has since confirmed saying that Biden has officially told the Pentagon and NATO to greenlight what's already been delivered,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.110]  attack them, Family of missiles.
[00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:40.029]  Not just the storm shadows built between the United States and England.
[00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:45.669]  The components here, they're assembled in France, but the British own the company with the United States company.
[00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:48.269]  It's a NATO consortium.
[00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:58.450]  That heavy cruise missiles, giant missiles, that are designed to carry hydrogen bomb payloads.
[00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.350]  That's their main mission.
[00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:10.980]  To be high speed up close to the border that you'd use to knock out Russian nuke sites in a preemptive attack.
[00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:14.700]  They are a sneak attack weapon when deployed to where they are.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:24.179]  And the Russians have said, and Putin has said, we played the videos last night, months ago, when Biden said he'd authorized it but didn't want it to be known officially, the Russians said, you better stop.
[00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:28.460]  If you deploy those, we are, quote, at war.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:41.179]  With the United States and NATO. And if you fire them into our country, we reserve the right to use nuclear weapons on you.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.179]  And I'll show you the articles and show you the videos again.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.019]  But this is not a secret.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.559]  This is everywhere.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.639]  It didn't trend as important as the NFL last night today, but close.
[00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:56.379]  World War III was number eight on X. Should have been number one.
[00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:01.090]  You're seeing videos of some of these missiles with cluster bomb packages.
[00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.590]  But their main mission is hydrogen bombs.
[00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:16.070]  So, the Russians have said, if you move them to our border and aim them at us, we consider we are at full war with NATO, which we already are at war with Russia, but it's official.
[00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:22.070]  And if you fire them into our country, we reserve the right to use nuclear weapons on NATO countries.
[00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.830]  And Zelensky was celebrating it yesterday.
[00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.980]  Alexander Soros was celebrating it.
[00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:33.980]  The Democrats were, yay, let's bomb Russia.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.860]  That'll show them.
[00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.899]  It's a nuclear superpower.
[00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:41.120]  They have more nukes, reportedly, than the United States.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:50.740]  Nuclear submarines off of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coast of Mexico.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.759]  So let's go over it.
[00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.210]  Biden authorizes Ukraine to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike inside Russia.
[00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.250]  Fox News.
[00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.149]  Biden approves Ukraine's use of long-range U.S. weapons.
[00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:07.289]  It's not Ukraine running it.
[00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:08.370]  Inside Russia.
[00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.730]  Reversing policy.
[00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.950]  And the Washington Post says most of his advisors told him don't do it.
[00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:17.389]  It'll probably cause nuclear war, but somehow he doesn't know who he is now.
[00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:18.049]  He just did it.
[00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:25.610]  Deep State financier Alex Soros openly celebrating the potential of U.S. long-range weapons being fired into Russia.
[00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.230]  They aren't even hiding anymore.
[00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:39.070]  They are openly pushing World War III. This is great news, said Alexander Soros, of Biden has for the first time authorized Ukraine forces these Western-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russia.
[00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:52.019]  You know, Vietnam was a proxy war between the United States and the Chinese and the Russians, but Imagine if LBJ said, we're going to start bombing inside Russia in this proxy war.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.360]  Korea was a proxy war between the United States and China.
[00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:59.539]  Imagine if the authorization was to start bombing inside China or vice versa.
[00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:02.539]  So that's what this is.
[00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.480]  Oh, we'll just bomb the country we're in a proxy war with.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.019]  What's that do?
[00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:07.940]  Take you into full, direct war.
[00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:22.570]  The same people that told you they were winning in Vietnam, that Saddam Hussein was about to attack you, that Afghanistan was a win, that Biden has sharp as attack, have told you Russia is the aggressor and that Ukraine is a democracy.
[00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.769]  Sweden tells citizens to prepare for war.
[00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:46.889]  Five million households get pamphlets on how to get ready their home for nuclear Armageddon as Biden is accused of trying to start World War III. This is a very big step towards the start of World War III, says furious Putin official, as Biden lets Ukraine strike inside Russia before Trump becomes president.
[00:14:46.889 --> 00:14:47.870]  It's not Ukraine.
[00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:49.750]  It's NATO. They direct it.
[00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:51.450]  They satellite direct the weapons.
[00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:57.950]  German Chancellor Schultz is refusing approving long-range missiles and saying this needs to stop.
[00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:02.750]  Yeah, I guess the Germans lost 24 million people in World War II. They might have learned their lesson.
[00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:07.480]  That Hitler and Napoleon had a bad idea attacking Russia.
[00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:11.820]  Joe Biden trying to start World War III before Donald Trump takes office.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.879]  A controversial move.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.799]  Says President Trump's son.
[00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:15.559]  Yeah.
[00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.679]  And it goes on and on.
[00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:24.980]  I'm going to go over all of that in more detail and explain doctrine in a moment.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.139]  But here is President Trump...
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.100]  Explaining this needs to end right now.
[00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:32.779]  There needs to be a ceasefire.
[00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:37.080]  And Putin and Zelensky need to come to the table.
[00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:45.600]  But instead, the State Department admits they're putting all their resources, their entire budget, that wasn't even earmarked for Ukraine, into Ukraine.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.980]  And a bunch of them have bought houses in the CIA and State Department in Ukraine.
[00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:56.019]  And they're in the New York Times talking about leaving the country to Ukraine and moving there.
[00:15:57.669 --> 00:16:11.570]  And a bunch of these officials, our former Ukrainians, their parents, grandparents, literally fought on the Nazi side in World War II. Also, the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, her dad was one of the top Nazis in Ukraine.
[00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.149]  Can't make this up.
[00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:15.830]  And grandfather.
[00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.950]  And so this is like home to them.
[00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:20.769]  You're like, why would they move to Ukraine?
[00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.429]  Because they're from there.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.059]  So they've been using the money and laundering it over there and they've got all that billions and billions for themselves.
[00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:37.799]  And so they're just putting all the money they can there right now while also escalating into pure World War III to create such a global crisis.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.700]  Somehow Trump doesn't get into office or he's handed a giant war.
[00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.779]  I mean, this is just absolutely insane.
[00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:45.720]  Here is President Trump.
[00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:48.399]  Remember, we're going to get World War III with Trump.
[00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:50.039]  No, he had no major wars with Trump.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.679]  Here's President Trump.
[00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.789]  than we are today under Joe Biden.
[00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.589]  Let's stop this.
[00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:08.569]  I don't want the first second of him cut off.
[00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.009]  It's just every word he's saying is absolutely key.
[00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.009]  We'll fade up the audio, prepare the clip.
[00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.130]  Let's give it a moment.
[00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.250]  Here is President Trump.
[00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.890]  To World War III than we are today under Joe Biden.
[00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:33.789]  A global conflict between nuclear armed powers would mean death and destruction on a scale unmatched in human history.
[00:17:34.109 --> 00:17:37.089]  It would be nuclear Armageddon.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.799]  Nothing is more important than avoiding that nightmare.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.559]  We will avoid it, but we need new leadership.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.299]  Every day this proxy battle in Ukraine continues.
[00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:50.660]  We risk global war.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:18:00.839]  We must be absolutely clear that our objective is to immediately have a total secession of hostilities.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.079]  All shooting has to stop.
[00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:05.180]  This is the central issue.
[00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.809]  We need peace without delay.
[00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:23.769]  In addition, there must also be a complete commitment to dismantling the entire globalist neocon establishment that is perpetually dragging us into endless wars, pretending to fight for freedom and democracy abroad.
[00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:32.690]  While they turn us into a third world country and a third world dictatorship right here at home.
[00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:47.579]  The State Department, the defense bureaucracy, the intelligence services, and all of the rest need to be completely overhauled And reconstituted to fire the deep staters and put America first.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.859]  We have to put America first.
[00:18:51.279 --> 00:19:00.579]  Finally, we have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally re-evaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.819]  Our foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:12.779]  With a nuclear-armed Russia based on the lie that Russia represents our greatest threat.
[00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:18.160]  But the greatest threat to Western civilization today is not Russia.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:28.559]  It's probably, more than anything else, ourselves and some of the horrible, USA-hating people that represent us.
[00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:31.819]  It's the abolition of our national borders.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.940]  It's the failure to police our own cities.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.039]  It's the destruction of the rule of law from within.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:46.619]  It's the collapse of the nuclear family and Fertility rates like nobody can believe is happening.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:55.799]  It's the Marxists who would have us become a godless nation worshiping at the altar of race and gender and environment.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:04.099]  And it's the globalist class that has made us totally dependent on China and other foreign countries that basically hate us.
[00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:19.740]  These globalists want to squander all of America's strength, blood, and treasure, chasing monsters and phantoms overseas while keeping us distracted from the havoc they're creating right here at home.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.599]  These forces are doing more damage to America than Russia and China could ever have dreamed.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.579]  Evicting this sick and corrupt establishment is the monumental task for the next president.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.900]  And I am the only one who can do it.
[00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:36.940]  I'm the only one that can get the job done.
[00:20:37.099 --> 00:20:39.000]  I know exactly what has to be done.
[00:20:43.369 --> 00:20:45.609]  Now, that's Trump over a year ago.
[00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.049]  And boy, isn't he proven right.
[00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:58.250]  And we are reportedly waiting on a statement that's updated from the president, but that's just as pertinent and evergreen, ultra-green, even more important today than when he said it over a year ago.
[00:20:58.509 --> 00:21:04.170]  His son has come out and obviously pointed out they're trying to start World War III ahead of him getting into office with 62 days left.
[00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.869]  There are analysts everywhere I showed you some of the headlines saying this is the greatest threat ever.
[00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:11.809]  We are so close.
[00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:22.019]  And then you've got people like Alexander Soros who couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag and knows nothing about military doctrine or history for that matter, even though he's got a degree in it.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.299]  Philosophy and all this crap.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.500]  And his philosophy is being a mentally ill dirtbag who hates America and hates freedom.
[00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:34.940]  So these people are completely out of their minds.
[00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:46.029]  And if they start bombing inside Russia, military bases, the doctrine of Russia is to be officially at war.
[00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:54.109]  And I'll show you some of those CNN headlines where Russia has said, if you authorize the use, which has been done, we will be officially at war with you.
[00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:55.490]  That was last night.
[00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:59.049]  Now they say, you're the closest to World War III you've ever been.
[00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:07.269]  And we are looking at hitting with a tactical nuclear weapon some of the main military complex areas in Poland.
[00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:18.589]  So they've already floated that as a target as major staging areas on the border with Ukraine in eastern Poland where this stuff's being stockpiled.
[00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.170]  So the missiles get fired into Russia.
[00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.329]  They don't know their nuclear tip.
[00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:24.549]  They try to shoot them down.
[00:22:26.309 --> 00:22:32.049]  And then Russia has said in a bunch of statements the last few months, He had said, we'll just blow Paris up.
[00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:35.089]  And Putin said, no, no, no.
[00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.809]  And then he had the general staff come out and talk about potential targets, and they talked about some in Ukraine or in Poland.
[00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.730]  So what you do is, you get on the phone with the White House, but they admit for years the White House doesn't talk to Putin.
[00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:49.190]  Remember that state taunt.
[00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.710]  Kennedy and Reagan and Nixon on the phone with the Russians and the Chinese when this stuff would happen.
[00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.269]  Cuban Missile Crisis, many other examples.
[00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.049]  Now there's just no communication going on, basically.
[00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:09.250]  And the Russians said, well, if you do this, we'll probably just not go to full nuclear war.
[00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.990]  We'll just get on the phone and say, okay, we're about to hit a city.
[00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:15.430]  We're about to hit a major military complex.
[00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.670]  And if we see any of your missiles fired or respond to this, we're going to go to full nuclear war.
[00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.730]  And then they blow up a large area and say, okay, you ready?
[00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.029]  Because that's the shot across the bow.
[00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:33.380]  And that's the only move they say they have ahead of total war.
[00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:40.779]  Because they've ruled out using their weapons, their conventional weapons, to try to take out all these missile sites so they can just move them around.
[00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:52.869]  So that's how the threat escalation doctrine that's been adopted by the world, that the Rand Corporation developed in the 50s that's updated, And it's a threat ladder that goes from zero up to the low 40s.
[00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:59.670]  The low 40s is total global nuclear war, total commitment within 30 minutes of this starting.
[00:24:00.109 --> 00:24:03.089]  The surface of the earth is unlivable for thousands of years.
[00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:11.130]  So, that's where we are.
[00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.670]  And once the order goes out, the Russian submarines pop up.
[00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.230]  And one submarine can vaporize all the cities on the East Coast.
[00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:24.089]  One submarine can vaporize all the cities on the West Coast.
[00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:29.890]  And they've got dozens and dozens of them in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:40.269]  And then it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to fire ICBMs and other weapons over the North Pole and vaporize Chicago, New York.
[00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:48.289]  And if you don't think the Russians haven't smuggled nuclear weapons in the United States, think again.
[00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:53.490]  They're buried, jacketed in lead, so satellites can't pick them up.
[00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:56.130]  The West has smuggled nukes into Russia.
[00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.069]  You can bet your bottom dollar that's going on.
[00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.170]  Some of those programs going on until the 90s have leaked.
[00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:06.170]  And then immediately, Pakistan and India are going to start nuking each other.
[00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:07.869]  China will join in.
[00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.210]  And Israel will start vaporizing the Middle East.
[00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:13.750]  Iran's got nukes.
[00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.009]  Saudi Arabia's got nukes.
[00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:15.809]  Secret programs.
[00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:16.809]  Israel's got nukes.
[00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:17.509]  Secret program.
[00:25:18.009 --> 00:25:20.849]  I mean, this is a Mexican standoff where everybody shoots each other.
[00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.630]  Everybody's pointing at everybody with guns.
[00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:29.430]  So Russia flaunts its many doomsday weapons to keep the West from ramping up support for Ukraine.
[00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:33.529]  Now, Russia's flexing their weapons.
[00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:36.369]  The West is authorized, as of yesterday at 2 p.m.
[00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.009]  Central, the bombardment inside Russia.
[00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.890]  Now, I don't know if they're going to make good on that.
[00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:43.660]  The German Chancellor says it's insane.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.680]  It is insane.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.359]  This needs to stop right now.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.440]  But we're the bad guys.
[00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:49.339]  We're the crazy people, remember?
[00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.109]  Please remember, we cannot operate without your support.
[00:25:53.230 --> 00:26:12.069]  We try to make it really easy for you with incredible supplements, incredible patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people and get the broadcast on air and a lot of limited edition fundraiser posters with Trump back-to-back-to-back win and the InfoWars Star Wars-esque Alex Jones poster that's very popular.
[00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:13.910]  That really helps us raise funds.
[00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.269]  It's limited edition at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.329]  And believe me, folks, people see how much weight I've lost, how healthy I am.
[00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:22.690]  A lot of it is the sea moss.
[00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:30.990]  It's Irish sea moss, concentrated 40 grams of sea moss, equivalent in just one serving of two pills.
[00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:37.970]  Sea moss has the best organic iodine, the best vitamins and minerals, the way it's all produced naturally by the plant in the ocean.
[00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:43.289]  It is the superfood, rivaling even hemp for its different benefits.
[00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:45.809]  But you got to say sea moss and hemp are like king daddies.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.720]  And, you know, hemp has all its amazing effects.
[00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:50.119]  CMOS has its amazing effects.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.240]  CMOS has been all the rage for many years.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.940]  We just private label it from a top producer, so it's the best out there.
[00:26:55.099 --> 00:26:57.539]  An incredibly low price, up to 55% off.
[00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:58.759]  I can tell you that deal's about to end.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.579]  You get three bottles, 40% for one.
[00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:05.759]  You want the CMOS. It is incredible for your stamina, libido, immune system, energy, everybody.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.460]  Men, women, children need CMOS. You'll feel it immediately, and if you're on it a few weeks, it gets even better.
[00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:13.720]  Ultimate CMOS, and by the way, you get $40 to spend in the store.
[00:27:14.369 --> 00:27:17.230]  Every month when you're a VIP member, so be sure to check out the VIP system.
[00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:17.730]  That's great.
[00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:26.190]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.809]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:38.309]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD. It's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it.
[00:27:38.509 --> 00:27:41.490]  And you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.710]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.250]  Everybody knows how amazing it is.
[00:27:46.309 --> 00:27:49.150]  But not all CBD is equal.
[00:27:49.690 --> 00:28:02.549]  This is a high-quality, made-in-Texas, very strong CBD, 1,000-milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[00:28:03.109 --> 00:28:13.069]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:20.009]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.990]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:31.269]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[00:28:31.349 --> 00:28:38.089]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.599]  Visit jonescbd.com today, and I think of your support.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:25.039]  All right, I want to say something here, and I want to be very crystal clear and very calm about this because this is so dangerous and so historically insane.
[00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:28.059]  Um...
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.759]  I mean, for new listeners or just for politicos and people that are tuned in, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:46.799]  I grew up playing sports and wasn't really a bookworm, but liked to read a lot.
[00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:55.880]  And I was a really good reader by five or six, and I was reading at an adult level by six or seven.
[00:29:57.049 --> 00:30:03.630]  And so I started reading books and magazines about history and military stuff that were around the house because my parents were into that.
[00:30:04.589 --> 00:30:17.849]  And by the time I was 10, I was reading textbook-level stuff on military history, modern history at the time, near history, recent history, and also ancient history.
[00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:27.990]  So I understand for the general public, Both conservatives and liberals, but conservatives know more about the military than liberals, obviously.
[00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:33.410]  That when I get up here and I talk about these things, people think, oh, Alex Jones is just being a scaremonger.
[00:30:33.609 --> 00:30:50.549]  I mean, who knows about hydrogen bomb yields and tactical nuclear weapons and x-ray lasers and particle beams and light pebble and DU decapitation sabot arrays.
[00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:54.470]  I mean, who knows about that stuff?
[00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.509]  Well, I knew about it when I was 10 years old.
[00:30:56.569 --> 00:30:57.410]  I found it fascinating.
[00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.890]  And so, I've been studying this for 40 years.
[00:31:06.569 --> 00:31:07.990]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.930]  Everything I'm saying here is known military doctrine.
[00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:21.690]  So, just like a 5-year-old knows how to say A, B, C, D, E, F, G... And can go to Z, and it's like, yeah, okay, the five-year-old knows how to say his ABCs.
[00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:23.150]  That's not even a very smart five-year-old.
[00:31:23.309 --> 00:31:25.069]  Most three-year-olds can say ABCs.
[00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:29.970]  So when I'm saying all this, I'm up here saying the ABCs, okay?
[00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.950]  There's a lot more to know about this than I do, but I have massive general knowledge of it.
[00:31:36.309 --> 00:31:38.410]  Because it's fascinating, and I've kept up on it.
[00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:43.920]  And not just the stuff they admit they've got, but there's been a lot of leaks and information on what's available.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.039]  And some of them has been put out by the Pentagon on purpose.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.519]  I remember 20 years ago, they were having a press conference and leaking the Pentagon had antimatter weapons.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:01.200]  And they were saying we can't test them because theoretically, you know, the bombs we've got would blow up the solar system.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.220]  So yeah, if you think 1945...
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.480]  Fat Man and Little Boy were big.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.220]  What do you think they got now?
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:29.359]  I mean, if they had atomic bombs in 1945 that would totally destroy downtown Austin, they admit they have hydrogen bombs that one bomb would blow up 10,000,
[00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:34.539]  20,000 square miles anywhere it gets dropped, depending on the altitude of where it's detonated.
[00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:57.529]  So, when I talk about, more importantly than the weapons, I mean, that's important, but tantamount, I guess parallel, or in Congress with that, I guess the word would be, as equally important, is the doctrine of what triggers their use.
[00:32:58.349 --> 00:33:06.390]  So I talk a lot about this, but if you just type in the Rand Corporation- Warfare threat escalation ladder.
[00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:16.250]  That's the basic thing that's studied by everybody in war game by the militaries and the geniuses and the mathematicians and the supercomputers.
[00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.730]  And in every scenario...
[00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:33.809]  Where you start using nuclear weapons, it leads to either a massive nuclear war or a total complete orgy of destruction, and that's generally where it goes.
[00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:37.390]  So it leads from a big nuclear war to the end of the planet as we know it.
[00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:49.359]  And the way it generally starts is if you move offensive missiles up to your enemy's border, That are just 20-30 seconds away from military bases.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:34:00.420]  You can sneak attack with nuclear weapons and take out the airfields, the cruise missile launch fields, the ICBM fields.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:09.019]  And of course, if you're going to do that, you take out the command and control, so you fire 20 missiles at the Kremlin.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:30.099]  Space-based weapons would be in alignment and would drop DU Sabos, or the equivalent of, it's really the old name is meteor guns, but you fire a 100, 200, 300, 400 pound, kilo projectile with a booster control system on it.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:40.219]  It enters the atmosphere and uses atmospheric and gravitational pull to accelerate to 35,000 miles an hour or faster.
[00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:51.010]  And then its kinetic force isn't that of a hydrogen bomb and it doesn't use a nuclear chain reaction to create its destructive power.
[00:34:51.710 --> 00:35:01.590]  But just the 100 or 200 pound object at that speed will kill somebody two miles under a mountain.
[00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:10.349]  So you decapitate your enemy leadership with the Sabos or with the meteor weapons.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.099]  But it's called a meteor gun because it has the same effect as a meteor accelerating an asteroid into the atmosphere.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.719]  But it doesn't break up because of what it's made of.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.699]  And so it would go like this.
[00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:37.219]  They simultaneously hit targets from space with these huge platforms since the 70s that have these decapitation weapons on them.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.119]  And that's the stuff they had in the 70s.
[00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:46.590]  Anybody with an amateur's telescope, you see the big platforms.
[00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.230]  And what they are is just grid platforms.
[00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.550]  And then they put the secret payloads up on them, and then they have weapon systems on them.
[00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:55.429]  And they're just orbiting.
[00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.989]  And they've got all the weapons just aimed down.
[00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.250]  And then they just fire them off, and they speed up into the atmosphere.
[00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:07.570]  And use a gravitational pull to accelerate.
[00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:10.090]  So, they're not going for hours.
[00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.110]  That's just one weapon system.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:44.059]  They've also got x-ray laser arrays where they've got hydrogen bombs in orbit that have huge, I don't want to say huge, a large number of projectors on them that intensify and focus the radiation into high-powered particle beams That
[00:36:44.059 --> 00:37:00.619]  they can then target either ground targets, those aren't as good as it loses some of the power in the atmosphere, but it's mainly for space attacks, show that you've got all these different arrays, and let's say 20 ICBMs are coming up, and they all track with a computer, and they aim the different arrays at what spots they want,
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:16.280]  and then the hydrogen bomb detonates, and in that explosion, it directs the energy out to fry the missiles, and And they've also got the smart pebble arrays where you've got basically Gatling guns in space.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:28.860]  And unlike shooting a gun on Earth where the Coriolis effect of the Earth spinning and the gravity makes the bullet drop and change course or move, it doesn't happen in space to any real degree.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:41.900]  And so you've got these high-powered Gatling guns that fire just tiny little bullets, generally uranium, And then it just...
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.739]  And then those shoot up everybody else's.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.800]  You don't just shoot down ICBMs or missiles.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.300]  You shoot the enemy's other spacecraft.
[00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:52.840]  You attack their platforms.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.000]  That's the first thing they do.
[00:37:55.659 --> 00:38:00.480]  If the West launches a sneak attack on Russia, they would launch decapitation weapons on the ground.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.219]  They would have a lot of the space-based stuff would target the other Russian and Chinese satellites.
[00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:09.559]  This is all simultaneously.
[00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:12.480]  So they're killing the leadership on the ground with decapitation weapons.
[00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:15.119]  They're taking out enemy satellites and weapon platforms.
[00:38:17.699 --> 00:38:32.820]  They are launching up close hypersonic missiles to take out the Russian or Chinese launch fields for their nuclear weapons and other systems.
[00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:40.940]  And then of course at the same time Submarines are going to be in place, mainly robot submarines.
[00:38:42.679 --> 00:38:43.679]  That's a little secret.
[00:38:44.199 --> 00:38:45.780]  There's not much people doing it anymore.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.980]  And then they'll cut the main lines, the fiber optic cables and things, into Russia and China.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:09.340]  And then, of course, simultaneously, it's all happening at the same time, the submarines pop up And they fire their payloads at the Russians.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:22.559]  And because China's allied with Russia, if the West goes to war with Russia, they're not going to bring the Chinese into that, especially now there's been a major break in the last 10 years with China.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.300]  So China will be hit, North Korea will be hit, all in the same 60 seconds.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:37.300]  So take out the Russian and Chinese response, take out their leadership, take out their satellites, both defensive and offensive.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:46.019]  Have the submarines launch their cruise missiles and ICBM ballistic missiles.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:54.019]  For good measure, you'll have the bombers going in at low altitude.
[00:39:54.019 --> 00:39:56.679]  They'll be launched as the backup to take out whatever's left.
[00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:19.800]  And then you'll have the second wave, minutes after that, of more hydrogen-tip missiles, hydrogen bomb-tip missiles and other goodies being fired over the borders in to take out the second, third, fourth primary targets.
[00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:26.019]  And then you'll have the exotic stuff being used as well.
[00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:33.639]  There's going to be a lot of cities the globalists want, so they're going to hit, with hydrogen bombs, the military targets.
[00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:44.289]  They'll probably hit the cities with high-powered neutron bombs that leave the infrastructure but kill all the life on the surface and giant radiation bursts.
[00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:47.210]  And there's a lot more goes into it.
[00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:54.269]  But that's a three-year-old A, B, C, D, E, F, G, you know, just knowing your alphabet.
[00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:09.210]  So we sit here and talk about this and There is the Russian doctrine and the U.S. doctrine and the NATO doctrines are all the same.
[00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:10.030]  It's all been war-gamed.
[00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.110]  So it's whatever the response to this is that.
[00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.230]  If they do this, we do that.
[00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:15.190]  If that happens, we do this.
[00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:16.510]  Well, there's these different scenarios.
[00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.449]  There's all these plans and all these scenarios.
[00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:23.489]  We should get General Flynn on about this.
[00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.090]  Try and see if we can come on for 10 minutes.
[00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:31.170]  Former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.030]  He can tell you all about it.
[00:41:32.809 --> 00:41:33.849]  I'll tell you the exact same stuff.
[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.110]  This is just facts we're telling you.
[00:41:37.289 --> 00:41:42.809]  So, you're not going to be able to jump onto your desk and duck and cover from this.
[00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:58.510]  And then, of course, once that starts, the really nasty bioweapons get released, and just everyone in an orgy just starts firing and killing and releasing, and civilization is over in about 35 minutes.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.599]  You're like, well, why release bioweapons?
[00:42:02.699 --> 00:42:03.820]  Well, that's for whoever survives.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:13.019]  Because then it becomes a program of you've got to kill as many of the civilians as you can in total war so they can never rebuild.
[00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:18.639]  So...
[00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:26.719]  I understand all these leftists, they think death's cool and war's cool and Sean Penn's like, hey, let's put nuclear war on the table.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.800]  Let's go ahead and nuke Russia.
[00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:30.320]  We need to be ready to use nuclear weapons first.
[00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:36.440]  That these are sick, evil people that are completely and totally mentally ill.
[00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:53.730]  And then you've got emblematically, sure, the think tanks, the CIA, the tax-free foundations that have their globalist program, but still, even the puppets, That are supposedly in charge, aren't running anything,
[00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.829]  and there's all this plausible deniability that BlackRock and the Big Banks have been hiding behind.
[00:42:59.269 --> 00:43:08.349]  They already killed 30 million people with their COVID shots and counting, so because they're so removed from it, though they set the policy, they feel like they're insulated.
[00:43:08.889 --> 00:43:16.010]  No one, whether you're Zuckerberg or Larry Fink or King Charles, no one is...
[00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.809]  We're insulated and protected and immune from this.
[00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:26.210]  I mean, I saw articles today that at the royal palaces all over England, everything's getting robbed.
[00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.469]  The staff are robbing all the jewels, the paintings.
[00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.269]  They're stealing the farm equipment.
[00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.230]  It's all total lawlessness.
[00:43:33.989 --> 00:43:39.889]  Now, they brought in lawlessness to control the population because they're globalists, but now they're not safe.
[00:43:40.469 --> 00:43:42.949]  I mean, what do you think is going to happen in a nuclear war?
[00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.289]  Do you really think King Charles is going to be around?
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.559]  But these people are all surrounded by sycophants.
[00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:57.599]  The Rothschilds, all of them.
[00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:08.119]  And they're so pissed that Russia won't cut their son's genitals off and isn't under their control anymore when they controlled it for 85 years and used it as an engine of evil around the world.
[00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:10.960]  Just like America's occupied with a globalist now being used as an engine of evil.
[00:44:11.059 --> 00:44:19.480]  And we're trying to take the keys away from the lunatic, the drunk driver right now, the psychotic drunk driver who's on, you know, 10 hits of acid.
[00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:27.690]  And they think we're the bad people because we're trying to just have a pro-human, teen humanity course.
[00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.010]  And that's where we are.
[00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.690]  So...
[00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:43.250]  You look at the video of Mitch McConnell yesterday saying there won't be recess appointments of Matt Gaetz and all that.
[00:44:43.369 --> 00:44:44.530]  Well, yes, there will.
[00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:53.429]  And the law says the party that controls the Senate, if they don't get approved or the other party holds up the appointments, the president can do his appointments.
[00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.650]  Yes, there will be.
[00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:02.730]  Senator Rick Scott...
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:11.460]  Snaps back at reporter, alleges Mitch McConnell will not allow Trump recess appointments.
[00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:20.039]  Well, I mean, Mitch McConnell looks like he has one foot into the Grim Reaper's abode.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.639]  I mean, every time they roll him out now, he doesn't even know who he is.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.480]  He doesn't just freeze up for like a minute or two like he did a year ago.
[00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:30.719]  He doesn't know where he's at.
[00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:36.940]  And then he just says, no recess appointments.
[00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:48.420]  And then you got Biden down in Brazil, goes up for a press conference, mumbles for 30 seconds, and then just wanders off into the woods.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.159]  I mean, we've all had family in the nursing home.
[00:45:51.699 --> 00:45:54.780]  And you go see grandma and grandpa, and their mind's still there pretty much, but...
[00:45:56.119 --> 00:45:57.559]  You walk in the front door, and there's an old man.
[00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:01.480]  He goes, Billy, Billy, you're my son, Billy!
[00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:03.460]  I'm like, no, what's your name?
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.039]  I don't know my name.
[00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:09.900]  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.519]  And, or there'll be an old lady just saying the same word over and over again.
[00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:16.619]  I used to go see my great-grandmother in Dallas, nursing home.
[00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:21.800]  Every week, my mom would get some lunch and go see her.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.340]  She was sharp until the day she died at almost 100.
[00:46:26.249 --> 00:46:27.590]  But she had trouble walking.
[00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:31.510]  It was this old-fashioned, big, beautiful nursing home, big, giant oak trees out front.
[00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:34.989]  They always had a cool saltwater tank I'd see when I'd go in the front door.
[00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.030]  For years, there was this woman.
[00:46:38.849 --> 00:46:39.570]  So I went and saw her.
[00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.110]  She went to nursing when I was about three.
[00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:42.730]  I remember putting her in there.
[00:46:43.789 --> 00:46:48.690]  And I remember she died when I was about 10 gram.
[00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:56.150]  And I remember this woman, at least the first five, six years, she'd sit below this painting of Jesus that was in this big living room area.
[00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:03.170]  And she would go, Mabian, Mabian, Mabian, Mabian.
[00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:11.969]  And almost every time I'd come in on a Saturday or Sunday or whenever it was when it was a weekday, you know, to see Graham, that woman would be in there going, Mabian, Mabian.
[00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.849]  And she had big red cheeks and would just go, Mabian, Mabian.
[00:47:16.409 --> 00:47:22.349]  I mean, that's, I remember the words, because Mabian was someone's name or something.
[00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.630]  Maybe that was her name.
[00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:24.210]  I don't know.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.099]  Come home, you should bring a whole bunch of lunch.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.239]  We'd eat dinner with the old ladies at their table.
[00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:32.500]  It was actually fun.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.019]  I liked it.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:34.800]  But...
[00:47:36.489 --> 00:47:38.630]  Literally, that's Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden.
[00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:52.190]  And a man who doesn't know who he is, who was ordered to step down, disappeared in a medical emergency for eight days, put out a fake resignation letter, just said, let's start bombing with heavy nuclear-capable missiles inside Russia.
[00:47:52.389 --> 00:47:58.010]  I mean, folks, the establishment is totally insane, completely out of their minds.
[00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.550]  I don't want a civil war.
[00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:01.590]  I don't want violence.
[00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.190]  But I'm just going to tell you something.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.980]  If the military gets the order to start firing those things into Russia, you need to say no.
[00:48:11.699 --> 00:48:14.260]  And you, if they try to court-martial you, you'll be a hero.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.000]  Now here's the problem.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.079]  They tell technicians to set these things up.
[00:48:18.179 --> 00:48:18.960]  They're satellite-controlled.
[00:48:19.179 --> 00:48:20.400]  They don't need people anymore.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:29.280]  And that's the problem of the technocracy and robots taking over, is because they will follow the order to launch nuclear war.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.239]  So...
[00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.309]  I don't want to escalate.
[00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:35.550]  I've never called for violence.
[00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:36.989]  I'm not saying get violent yet.
[00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:44.730]  But I'm going to ask everybody that works for the government, everybody else, are you really this freaking crazy?
[00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:47.989]  I mean, seriously, you like living, right?
[00:48:48.989 --> 00:48:53.670]  I know there's a normalcy bias, like somebody that, you know, drinks two bottles of vodka a day.
[00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:54.610]  I'll never die.
[00:48:54.809 --> 00:48:56.230]  I had my best friend.
[00:48:56.989 --> 00:49:02.130]  You know, I became a little bit of a drunk later, but I wasn't back then when he died at 33, age of Jesus.
[00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:05.590]  And man, he would drink two bottles of vodka a day.
[00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:11.050]  And the doctor told him about a month before, he said, you keep doing this, you're going to have organ failure.
[00:49:11.769 --> 00:49:13.789]  He didn't stop, and I was there when he died.
[00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:15.269]  And he was fighting for his life.
[00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:19.130]  They were injecting him with adrenaline just so his dad from Dallas could get there, and I was there when he died.
[00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:23.070]  And everybody told him, you're going to die.
[00:49:23.389 --> 00:49:24.829]  But he had a normalcy bias.
[00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.429]  And then his organs fell and he died.
[00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.929]  It's the same thing.
[00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:35.309]  I mean, the establishment's drinking the equivalent of 10 gallons of vodka a day.
[00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.409]  I mean, we're gonna have a nuclear war.
[00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:41.710]  But people been alive, you know, they think, oh, I'm never gonna die.
[00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:43.150]  I can smoke these cigarettes.
[00:49:43.369 --> 00:49:44.650]  I can drink this whiskey all day.
[00:49:44.769 --> 00:49:45.369]  I'm gonna be fine.
[00:49:45.469 --> 00:49:45.929]  No, you're not.
[00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.610]  But that's your life.
[00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.050]  You can kill yourself if you want to.
[00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.909]  We all make mistakes.
[00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:50.769]  I'm not judging anybody.
[00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:59.989]  This is our children and our species and the planet and the whales and the hummingbirds and the oak trees and the little kitty cats and the bumblebees.
[00:50:02.969 --> 00:50:09.730]  So roll the footage of Biden and then this is what we're up against.
[00:50:09.889 --> 00:50:14.650]  So you can laugh at these people but the lights are on but nobody's home.
[00:50:14.769 --> 00:50:15.170]  Here it is.
[00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:31.340]  Did you hear the question, Senator, running for re-election in 2026?
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.500]  All right, I'm sorry, you all, we're gonna need a minute.
[00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:40.400]  Okay.
[00:50:58.579 --> 00:50:59.760]  Somebody else have a question?
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.820]  Please speak up.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.179]  Did you hear the question, Senator?
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:11.360]  So, I'm just so sick of these.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.980]  We're in real danger.
[00:51:13.099 --> 00:51:14.099]  My family's in danger.
[00:51:14.219 --> 00:51:15.179]  My children are in danger.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.099]  Your children are in danger.
[00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:19.940]  And I just pray to God to frustrate these people and to stop them.
[00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.369]  I mean, I pray that God just melts the circuits in those missiles.
[00:51:26.489 --> 00:51:26.710]  I do.
[00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:29.349]  Please, God, in the name of Jesus, if that's your will.
[00:51:30.389 --> 00:51:32.590]  And I'll say it.
[00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:40.309]  If it's God's will, not at our hand, no violence by man, but just like Moses prayed to God to judge Pharaoh.
[00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:41.949]  God, if it's your...
[00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:43.150]  We're trying to fix things, God.
[00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:43.889]  We repent.
[00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:45.570]  But God, if it's your choice...
[00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:53.659]  Send an angel with a flaming sword to tell these people in their bedroom at 2am tonight to stop it.
[00:51:54.019 --> 00:52:01.679]  Or, God, if it's your choice to just have these globalists just fall over dead, then please, God, please protect us from these people.
[00:52:08.679 --> 00:52:13.860]  I mean, people that can't even talk are saying they're going to bomb Russia?
[00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:17.420]  And all these idiots keep following their orders?
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:26.980]  God, however you want to do it, all I'm asking is I pray that everyone pray to God to deliver us from these people.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:35.079]  We are 62 days out, and look, I know we're an evil planet, and we've killed 65 million babies here, and I understand it.
[00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:38.739]  I wouldn't be surprised if God just doesn't let us all be blown up.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:41.300]  But...
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:47.960]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[00:52:50.639 --> 00:53:02.150]  If they start bombing with heavy missiles, Russian military bases, strategically, that is World War III. We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:53:02.369 --> 00:53:05.170]  We'll continue on with all this news and a lot more, a lot of clips.
[00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.949]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:07.969]  Stay with us till everybody you know.
[00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:08.630]  Tune in now.
[00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:09.670]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:10.230]  You are the resistance.
[00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:25.809]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.030]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:35.199]  And people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[00:53:35.699 --> 00:53:39.579]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[00:53:39.679 --> 00:53:40.239]  Who knows?
[00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:43.179]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:57.840]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.239]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:15.000]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[00:54:15.389 --> 00:54:16.670]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[00:54:16.869 --> 00:54:31.409]  And if you remember, when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at theologistrestore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.639]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:39.179]  But that's going to get announced, the winner, here in just a few days.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.380]  And regardless of whether Infoward is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.880]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[00:54:47.119 --> 00:54:47.960]  So now...
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:56.059]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.940]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:03.400]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:04.539]  It's a beautiful truck.
[00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:10.469]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.

[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:04.340]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[00:57:04.619 --> 00:57:05.500]  God bless you all.
[00:57:05.679 --> 00:57:06.679]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.719]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:57:11.239 --> 00:57:15.019]  For years I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:21.400]  You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.219]  Because you all deserve it.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.639]  You know this f***ing deal that I'm about to sign?
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.159]  The f*** is that, you know?
[00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:35.739]  I'll tell you what it is.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:40.079]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.500]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[00:57:45.699 --> 00:57:49.400]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:56.440]  So...
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:04.460]  You know what?
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.059]  I'm not leaving.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.179]  I'm not leaving!
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.460]  The show goes on!
[00:59:10.409 --> 00:59:21.670]  Alright, we are now well into our number two on this live Monday, November 18th, 2024 transmission.
[00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:23.710]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.889 --> 00:59:30.969]  Alright, Roger Stone on Trump to declare national emergency to conduct mass deportations.
[00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:33.550]  That's official coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:38.570]  Trump also weighing court-martials for treasonous globalists in the Pentagon.
[00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:39.730]  That is a must.
[00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:44.349]  Dems openly trying to steal the Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:45.389]  They're not even denying it.
[00:59:45.469 --> 00:59:47.070]  I've got video clips of that.
[00:59:47.869 --> 00:59:49.309]  We've got Donald Trump Jr.
[00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:55.590]  says military industrial complex seeks World War III before his father takes office and brings peace.
[00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.650]  We'll get into that first and cover the rest of the news.
[00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:01.409]  I haven't hit there yet.
[01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.869]  Also, just endless lies by Kamala Harris.
[01:00:06.659 --> 01:00:09.500]  She got caught paying Oprah Winfrey a million dollars to endorse her.
[01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:10.420]  Oprah denied it.
[01:00:10.639 --> 01:00:12.300]  Now it's the documents are public.
[01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:16.320]  In the election filing, 2.5 million.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.099]  So double what they said paid.
[01:00:21.239 --> 01:00:23.380]  I mean, it's just, if they're talking, they're lying.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.119]  About anything.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.400]  Because they're your enemy.
[01:00:26.679 --> 01:00:27.639]  They're scum.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:44.679]  They're inherently so mentally ill and selfish and like hyper-competitive to a mentally ill point where They'd rather have all the money in the world, even though it's worthless, and you can't buy anything, and they're starving to death in a bunker during nuclear war,
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:55.280]  than have you have a nice family, and a nice life, and a dog, and good medicine, and good security, and you'll be able to go on vacation twice a year.
[01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:58.760]  They don't want you having a swimming pool, and going to the church you want, or not.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.320]  They don't want you going and playing golf.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.260]  They want your ass dead.
[01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:11.090]  And it's a small percentage of people that are like this, but in history, they get control of things, they move their own people in, and they get full control, and then they just go crazy.
[01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:12.849]  It's called being a megalomaniac.
[01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:22.269]  And we've got just absolutely crazy, psychotic, selfish, satanic, delusional, inept maniacs.
[01:01:22.289 --> 01:01:23.650]  We all just bow down to the establishment.
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:24.449]  Oh, whatever you say.
[01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:25.429]  Oh, God, yeah.
[01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:26.710]  Trump's a Nazi.
[01:01:26.869 --> 01:01:28.269]  Alex Jones peed on kids' graves.
[01:01:28.409 --> 01:01:29.750]  Yes, we'll do bad things to them.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.360]  And then just hell gets released.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:32.900]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:33.199 --> 01:01:35.920]  Alright, let me blitz through the news now.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.099]  More on the World War III escalation to levels never before seen.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.059]  I can't believe we're even in this position.
[01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:43.579]  I'm pinching myself like I'm in a bad dream.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.039]  It's that bad.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:50.079]  And the public has a normalcy bias.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:02:02.059]  And again, that's like somebody who's been healthy their whole life until they're like 75 years old, and they have a giant heart attack, and they wake up from a coma a month later and can't walk, and it's like, wow, I can't believe this happened.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:15.199]  Or somebody that shoots heroin and doesn't believe they're going to have an overdose, and then they have one and barely survive, and wake up and have had a stroke and are paralyzed.
[01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:20.030]  You see, that'll get rid of your normalcy bias real quick.
[01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:21.829]  Like, people have never been in a car wreck.
[01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.730]  And you tell them, like, the most dangerous thing in the world is cars.
[01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.969]  But we decide to do it because it gives us freedom and it's fun.
[01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:33.050]  And then people finally have a really bad car wreck and they go, wow, these really suck.
[01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.090]  Yeah, you've never been in one, so you don't know.
[01:02:36.489 --> 01:02:38.250]  Wait till you're in one and roll a car.
[01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:41.769]  Wait till you get T-boned by somebody going 80 miles an hour.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.579]  Wait till five or six of your ribs are broken.
[01:02:46.119 --> 01:02:48.860]  And for three months, every time you breathe, it's torture.
[01:02:53.719 --> 01:02:56.719]  So, that's what it is to be domesticated.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.019]  And I've talked a lot about this.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:05.639]  But deer in major cities like Austin do not have any major predators other than walking out in front of cars and getting hit.
[01:03:06.099 --> 01:03:07.960]  And so they will walk right up to you.
[01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:10.059]  You can hand feed them in your backyard, many of them.
[01:03:10.969 --> 01:03:18.210]  Now, when you go out to the middle of the woods, say in East Texas, where there's coyotes and everything else and hunters, the deer don't even come out during the day.
[01:03:18.389 --> 01:03:21.190]  They shift to nocturnal so they can live.
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.010]  And you got to get in the middle of the woods to hunt them.
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.869]  You don't just sit in a field and wait for them to walk out.
[01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.650]  And it's the same thing.
[01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:35.949]  The general public in the West is completely and totally domesticated.
[01:03:38.659 --> 01:03:39.280]  On average.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:45.840]  And they hear people go, hey, you know, we put hypersonic missiles on the border with Russia and start bombing them.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.599]  They don't know there's not nukes on those.
[01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:48.840]  Those are designed to carry nukes.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:56.039]  And Russia has said they consider that war with NATO and we'll start attacking NATO targets and then we'll be in full war with Russia.
[01:03:56.619 --> 01:03:57.860]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:03:58.039 --> 01:03:59.659]  I've been hearing about war with Russia forever.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.239]  Well, that's because if it happened, we would all be dead.
[01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:05.860]  You know, it's like...
[01:04:08.389 --> 01:04:11.190]  Don't pour gasoline on yourself and light yourself on fire.
[01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:12.309]  And you're like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.969]  Well, some people do it.
[01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.429]  But see, this is the globalist.
[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:17.449]  Here's the analogy.
[01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:20.889]  Have put five gallons of gasoline...
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.840]  On to us.
[01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:28.159]  And they're about 10 feet away and have struck a match and are going, I'm going to get closer.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.139]  I'm going to get closer.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.880]  And if you've got gasoline all over you, a match at three or four feet away, the gas is in the air.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.599]  The gasoline fumes will ignite and soon you're on fire.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.179]  So we've got five gallons of gas on us.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.000]  The whole world does.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.000]  But as a person, we have gasoline dripping off of us.
[01:04:45.879 --> 01:04:49.420]  And Joe Biden just went, look, I got a match.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.780]  And he's about 10 feet away from us.
[01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:58.079]  And I'm like, that guy's coming at us with a match.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.519]  And we're like chained up against the wall here because his administration is still in power.
[01:05:03.639 --> 01:05:05.639]  And Trump's watching going, that's dangerous.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.059]  We need an immediate ceasefire.
[01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:07.900]  Stop that right now.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.460]  That's crazy.
[01:05:08.719 --> 01:05:17.469]  And that was the doctrine of Eisenhower and Harry Truman and JFK. And we stopped that.
[01:05:17.929 --> 01:05:22.869]  There's only been a few times where we're dousing gasoline and somebody's 10 feet away with a burning match.
[01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:24.650]  Or a blowtorch.
[01:05:26.909 --> 01:05:34.010]  So that's where we are, according to all the big threat assessment groups and all the analysts, and I've studied it myself, it's true.
[01:05:35.469 --> 01:05:41.530]  And so it's kind of hard for me to cover all the other insane, really important news, because all of that becomes...
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.239]  A side issue compared to this.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.800]  And that's why the globalists are triggering this to hold the world hostage and say, you better do what we want.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.000]  Trump better do what we want.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.840]  Everybody better follow our orders.
[01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:55.179]  We're crazy globalists that are backs against the wall.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.300]  And we got a gun to your head saying, I'll kill her.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:05:59.679]  I'll kill her.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.019]  I'll kill her.
[01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:00.639]  Like in a movie.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.719]  It's based on many true stories where somebody's robbing a store.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.599]  They're robbing a bank.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.119]  The cops come in.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.940]  What's the bank robber do?
[01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.719]  He grabs the teller and says, I'll kill her.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.099]  I'll kill her.
[01:06:11.159 --> 01:06:11.519]  I'll kill her.
[01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:14.940]  And we're at that point now with them going, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.280]  We're in charge.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:19.940]  We're in charge.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.260]  We'll blow up the North Stream pipeline.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.179]  We'll send heavy weapons.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:22.960]  We'll escalate.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.739]  Remember two years ago, we can't send F-16s or Abrams tanks.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.199]  That's World War III. Remember Biden?
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.440]  Guys, pull up Biden.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.280]  That's World War III. Quote, said it twice.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:42.519]  Because on the threat escalation ladder, his advisors were explaining to him, and it's in the New York Times that the majority of his advisors told him, sir, you can't do this.
[01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:44.119]  It will lead to full war.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.239]  Not a possibility, a probability with nuclear weapons.
[01:06:50.059 --> 01:06:52.159]  We're not picking on Saddam Hussein right now.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:01.760]  And he decided in the last few months not to do it when he said he was, and now he's like, I'm going to do it now.
[01:07:03.449 --> 01:07:12.750]  And look, you know, it's cute and it's nice that they give people with serious mentally handicaps, you know, extra chromosomes and things, jobs at McDonald's.
[01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.849]  Remember the old McDonald's ad?
[01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:17.949]  Welcome to McDonald's, may I help you?
[01:07:18.389 --> 01:07:35.880]  Well, in this case, Joe Biden is literally, welcome to McDonald's, and he's done this, but the bureaucrats above him have decided this brinksmanship Because they don't have a normalcy bias like the public does,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.179]  not knowing how much danger we're in.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.619]  They have a normalcy bias with getting away with everything they've ever done.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:48.960]  And if you study history and criminology and the mind of megalomaniacs, they always push too far until they destroy themselves.
[01:07:49.059 --> 01:07:52.820]  But now they've got nuclear weapons so they can destroy all of us in the process.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.599]  So this is the complete idiocy.
[01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:04.980]  That is going on.
[01:08:05.199 --> 01:08:07.840]  And Mitch McConnell says he supports the missiles being transferred.
[01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:11.719]  The Democratic Party celebrating and Alexander Soros.
[01:08:12.159 --> 01:08:14.619]  The Hollywood's like, wonderful, bomb Russia!
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:18.880]  Those Hollywood people don't even know how to load a gun.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.859]  They don't even know how hydrogen bombs work.
[01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.619]  They don't know about nuclear doctrine.
[01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:25.159]  They don't understand any of this.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.779]  And they're just like, yeah, it's tough.
[01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.859]  Start bombing them, yeah.
[01:08:31.369 --> 01:08:38.810]  They are degenerate, satanic, delusional, inept, just trash.
[01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:42.430]  So, let's go over it.
[01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.229]  And I already covered some of this, but I'm going to go with the rest of the stack of habits.
[01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:46.050]  Let me just recap it.
[01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.989]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:51.930]  says military industrial complex seeks World War III before his father takes office and brings peace.
[01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:52.970]  Yeah.
[01:08:54.489 --> 01:08:58.729]  Mystery as submarine Baltic sea data cable connecting...
[01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:03.239]  Finland and Germany is broken amid fears it was deliberately sabotaged.
[01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:04.060]  I think so.
[01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:10.140]  Sabotage not ruled out in breaking communications cable in Baltic Sea.
[01:09:12.199 --> 01:09:14.380]  Telecom cable linking Finland-Germany cut.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.039]  Operator.
[01:09:15.199 --> 01:09:16.760]  That's what you do before full war.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.060]  Biden authorizes Ukraine to use long-range missiles to strike inside Russia.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.239]  Biden approves Ukraine's use of long-range U.S. weapons inside Russia, reversing policy.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.319]  Here's Alexander Soros.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.300]  Biden announces plan to bomb Russia.
[01:09:33.539 --> 01:09:35.979]  This is great news, says Alexander Soros.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.399]  Satan likes it!
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.359]  My daddy, Satan, likes nuclear war!
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:40.880]  Yay!
[01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:41.960]  It's liberal!
[01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:55.600]  Trump, I'm hereby calling on Putin and Zelensky to meet with me and get this terrible war between Russia and Ukraine solved.
[01:09:56.319 --> 01:09:59.659]  We have never been closer to nuclear World War III than we are right now.
[01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:04.060]  We must stop the killing and prevent World War III. God, that's such an extremist.
[01:10:04.279 --> 01:10:04.439]  Man.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.020]  I wish he was liberal and trendy like Soros who can barely talk.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:08.720]  He's like...
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.460]  And it's not freedom.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.159]  Elections people don't get to elect what they want.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.079]  That's not the freedom as we stop it.
[01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:19.699]  Those of us that know best, I... Oh, this...
[01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:20.979]  Yeah, wonderful news.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.100]  Bomb Russia.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.439]  Yeah, okay.
[01:10:24.569 --> 01:10:25.210]  You want to hear him talk?
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.829]  That's how he talks.
[01:10:25.909 --> 01:10:27.229]  Well, that's more eloquent than him.
[01:10:27.609 --> 01:10:28.470]  It's hard to...
[01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:33.449]  At the beginning, I said, well, you know, you can't have people elect someone.
[01:10:33.569 --> 01:10:34.789]  That's not how it works.
[01:10:34.989 --> 01:10:35.970]  Democracy threatened.
[01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:36.750]  You don't...
[01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:44.989]  You know, we have policies and we have things we do here in this country that don't let that...
[01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:47.470]  You know, we don't...
[01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:48.810]  We have...
[01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:49.970]  Yeah, it's okay.
[01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.550]  All right.
[01:10:51.569 --> 01:10:54.149]  Sweden tells citizens to prepare for war.
[01:10:54.449 --> 01:11:02.130]  Five million households get pamphlets on how to get their homes ready, particularly Armageddon, as Biden is accused of trying to start World War III. Accused of it?
[01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:14.170]  This is a very big step towards the start of World War III, says furious Putin official, as Biden lets Ukraine strike inside Russia before Trump becomes president.
[01:11:14.909 --> 01:11:15.770]  Huge article.
[01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:16.310]  You should read it.
[01:11:17.369 --> 01:11:32.010]  German Chancellor refuses to approve long-range missiles to strike Russia and says NATO should pull back, citing the threat of unprecedented escalation of the war into a potential full war.
[01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.890]  Oh, really?
[01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.409]  Joe Biden trying to start World War III before Donald Trump takes office.
[01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:46.569]  Military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War III going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives.
[01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:49.670]  Gotta lock in those trillions.
[01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:52.189]  Life be damned.
[01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.789]  Imbeciles.
[01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:54.250]  Yep.
[01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.810]  What the heck's this lunatic doing?
[01:11:57.949 --> 01:12:03.109]  Joe Biden is visiting Amazon rainforest and leading us into World War III with Russia at the same time.
[01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:08.449]  We don't want World War III. Well, that sounds like another white supremacist to me.
[01:12:09.689 --> 01:12:12.449]  Biden allows Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range missiles.
[01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:13.369]  New York Times.
[01:12:13.489 --> 01:12:14.130]  That's the original article.
[01:12:14.909 --> 01:12:15.970]  Broke yesterday at 2 o'clock.
[01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.689]  And I got fact-checked on X by the left.
[01:12:21.829 --> 01:12:23.590]  They're like, I was quoting.
[01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.149]  I don't see it here in my article.
[01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:30.189]  I had the CNN and NAP article.
[01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:43.109]  Russia says, Putin says, if policy has changed to deliver long-range missiles to Ukraine, that Russia will be at war with NATO. I don't see that in my stack.
[01:12:43.289 --> 01:12:43.890]  Will you just...
[01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:46.659]  Reprint that.
[01:12:47.119 --> 01:12:48.460]  I want to show that to people.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.060]  We showed it yesterday.
[01:12:49.159 --> 01:12:53.600]  It'll be in yesterday's history from like 430 Central in there for you.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.640]  So, continuing.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:01.239]  Biden okays use of U.S.-supplied long-range missiles to Russia, to Ukraine to hit Russia.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:03.960]  Oh, here it is.
[01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:04.399]  I found it.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.880]  Russia will be at war with NATO if Ukraine long-range missile restrictions lifted, Putin warns.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:23.750]  Now, I just read that headline and explained the doctrine that And they've now authorized the delivery, so that means Russia's saying they're at war with NATO, and then a few hours later last night, I forgot off the air, they said, no, we're at war now.
[01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:28.289]  But the fact-checkers are like, don't be concerned, everybody.
[01:13:28.289 --> 01:13:29.069]  It's fine.
[01:13:29.069 --> 01:13:30.010]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:31.229]  Don't listen to him.
[01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:32.409]  Okay?
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.479]  Bombing Russia is good.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.399]  Everything's liberal now, okay?
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.039]  Yay, it's wonderful news.
[01:13:40.159 --> 01:13:41.079]  We're going to bomb Russia.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:46.319]  Don't listen to that crazy man, Trump or Jones, or Don Jr.
[01:13:46.699 --> 01:13:49.020]  They are very extreme.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.760]  So I'll show you the headline again.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.020]  Russia will be at war with NATO of Ukraine.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.960]  Long-range missile restrictions lifted.
[01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:01.350]  And then there's videos of Putin saying it.
[01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:05.210]  But again, the fact checkers are like, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.090]  We're at war with Russia already.
[01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:10.409]  The question is, how fast does it escalate?
[01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:22.649]  Moscow's comments on Biden's reported approval of strikes deep inside Russia, and it's all right here from last night, saying this is war.
[01:14:25.489 --> 01:14:26.090]  There's another one.
[01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:30.630]  Russia will be at war with NATO if Ukraine long-range missiles restrictions lifted.
[01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:32.890]  Here's Putin saying it.
[01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:34.770]  He says they reserve the right to use nuclear weapons.
[01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:36.789]  Here's the video right here.
[01:14:37.789 --> 01:14:44.489]  Russian president warned NATO will enter a direct war with Russia if Ukraine uses long-range Western missiles to strike inside Russia.
[01:14:44.649 --> 01:14:48.250]  Today, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to strike inside Russia using missiles.
[01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:49.890]  Now, that's what I said.
[01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:50.949]  What I said is true.
[01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:54.689]  But the fact-checkers say no.
[01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.699]  Then there's this insane clip, which I meant to have.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.380]  I had it yesterday.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.399]  Guys, pull it out of the list.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.159]  I want to play this clip.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.300]  This is Zelensky on Saturday saying, we don't need America if Trump gets in.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.479]  We can fight Russia on our own.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.380]  The United States is funding 85% of the war and directing it.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.800]  And Ukraine is already collapsing.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.260]  And so...
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:28.920]  This is like saying if you're a six-month-old baby that you can feed yourself, bathe yourself, clothe yourself, and drive yourself to the doctor.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.779]  It's bull crap.
[01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:32.300]  So get that clip.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.979]  The U.S. cannot force us to sit and listen to the negotiating table.
[01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:41.579]  We are an independent country, says President Zelenskyy.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.600]  That is hilarious.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.560]  And it wasn't so dangerous.
[01:15:45.659 --> 01:15:51.619]  And here's some of the loving attack of missiles and cruise missiles that they put the hydrogen bombs in.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Here's another one.
[01:15:59.239 --> 01:16:02.920]  Russia grinds deeper in Ukraine after a thousand days of grueling war.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.460]  Ukraine's totally collapsed.
[01:16:07.159 --> 01:16:08.880]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.300]  Here's the clip of Zelensky.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.180]  First, сильна Україна.
[01:16:15.239 --> 01:16:18.899]  Вона повинна бути сильною для будь-якої дипломатії.
[01:16:19.319 --> 01:16:21.060]  Хочу ще раз це підкреслити.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.159]  Але США не лише потенційний посередник в переговорах.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:31.380]  Це країна, яка надає величезні обсяги допомоги Україні і яка може спонукати нас до того, щоб ми сіли за стіл переговорів.
[01:16:31.579 --> 01:16:36.319]  What message did you get from Donald Trump during those contacts?
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:42.119]  He said, I'll be president and sit down on the table.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.260]  How does it look?
[01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:44.640]  I think he doesn't say.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.840]  We're independent of Ukraine.
[01:16:48.319 --> 01:17:27.760]  And, I think, during this war, our people, and I personally, in negotiations with the USA, and with Trump, and with Biden, and with other European leaders, All
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.060]  right.
[01:17:28.579 --> 01:17:32.840]  Sorry to play that radio station, but for a team of viewers you can see the...
[01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.770]  See the...
[01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:35.869]  I mean, I want to get it on record.
[01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:39.130]  I don't want it to be like the mainstream media that says somebody said something and then not show it to you.
[01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.750]  There it is.
[01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.409]  I'm going to blitz through news ahead of Roger Stone coming on.
[01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:45.310]  There's so much of it.
[01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:50.289]  It's hard to get off the World War III stuff, but there's a lot of other big things that are important as well.
[01:17:50.609 --> 01:17:53.449]  But here's the bottom line, and you know what it is, and Don Jr.
[01:17:53.529 --> 01:17:54.449]  got it right as well.
[01:17:56.689 --> 01:18:06.069]  This, again, is holding a gun to all our collective heads saying, you better do what we want You better go along with whatever behind the scenes we're trying to get Trump to negotiate to do.
[01:18:08.529 --> 01:18:12.590]  Because the power structure is trying to make a deal with him right now and you see more rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.989]  Dr.
[01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:22.270]  Redfield is the latest along with the morning Joe now kissing Trump's ass.
[01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.750]  So...
[01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:28.649]  You got all these other people rolling over.
[01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:31.850]  Bigger than that, obviously, Bezos, Zuckerberg.
[01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:35.109]  But that doesn't mean they're actually rolling over.
[01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:38.590]  But at least on the surface, they know that that is the case.
[01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:45.470]  But this is the establishment desperately just doing the one thing they could do.
[01:18:45.689 --> 01:18:47.369]  Because they know the race war is not going to work.
[01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.529]  False flags they staged.
[01:18:48.689 --> 01:18:52.710]  They're going to get busted doing it as well.
[01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.130]  And I want to talk about false flags as well.
[01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:58.270]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[01:18:58.810 --> 01:19:00.270]  Really important piece of history.
[01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:09.329]  But right now, just to give you a little smattering of some of our predictions over the years that of course unfolded just as we said they would because we're reading globalist doctrine and their plans.
[01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:13.350]  Here is clip six.
[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.630]  Alex Jones is the ghost in the machine.
[01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.050]  Here is clip six.
[01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:21.729]  The internet's freaking out right now.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.079]  There's viral videos everywhere of this show.
[01:19:25.859 --> 01:19:28.779]  On Instagram, on Twitter, on TikTok, on everywhere.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.600]  There's even articles about it, man.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.939]  You can't allow Alex Jones.
[01:19:33.119 --> 01:19:34.979]  I mean, these old clips are even worse than his new ones.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.539]  That's how it works.
[01:19:37.779 --> 01:19:39.399]  I'll be the ghost of the machine forever.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.060]  And so we're all our listeners and viewers.
[01:19:43.119 --> 01:19:45.680]  Because the worse it gets, the more people remember what we said.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.159]  That's the little secret.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:58.399]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.520]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[01:20:05.119 --> 01:20:11.100]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.840]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.199]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:20.500]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:20:21.199 --> 01:20:32.819]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.119]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:53.560]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength And the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:56.060]  I know why.
[01:20:56.479 --> 01:20:57.520]  Because it's scary.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.880]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.680]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[01:21:08.859 --> 01:21:13.229]  You're not going to be able to just You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:27.430]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:37.649]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:44.319]  Once you've faced this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:46.140]  It should take over your life.
[01:21:46.439 --> 01:21:47.680]  I mean, what else?
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.159]  What else could it do?
[01:21:51.199 --> 01:22:01.640]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[01:22:03.409 --> 01:22:06.869]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:14.609]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[01:22:14.909 --> 01:22:17.989]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:19.729]  Old clips are even worse than the new ones.
[01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:22.289]  That's how it works.
[01:22:22.569 --> 01:22:24.170]  I'll be the ghost of the machine forever.
[01:22:24.489 --> 01:22:25.869]  So are all our listeners and viewers.
[01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.350]  Because the worse it gets, the more people remember what we said.
[01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:31.869]  That's the little secret.
[01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:35.550]  Alright, we are back.
[01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:38.909]  Roger Stone is coming up with huge news covering the waterfront.
[01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.489]  I'll spend all the discussion about World War III for a while.
[01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:46.970]  Though it's hard to, because I have a lot of preparation, a lot to hit here.
[01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:53.510]  They're still trying to steal House seats, Senate seats, and they're just saying, yeah, we're counting illegal votes.
[01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:53.970]  We don't care.
[01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:54.710]  I have the video clips.
[01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:56.369]  That's all coming up.
[01:22:56.449 --> 01:23:01.649]  Please remember, we have incredible products at our amazing sponsor, thealexjohnstore.com.

[01:23:32.449 --> 01:23:33.069]  That's what I'm on.
[01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:34.710]  That's one of the reasons I'm so healthy.
[01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:36.510]  My skin is just glowing.
[01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:37.909]  I feel like I'm 20 again.
[01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:39.449]  It's the CMOS, folks.
[01:23:39.569 --> 01:23:40.689]  It's the main game changer.
[01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:43.890]  Working out harder, but it's the main thing.
[01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:44.689]  It's incredible.

[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.159]  We're good to go.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:24.279]  It is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.079]  It's insane.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:31.479]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:42.300]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.

[01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:48.489]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[01:24:49.329 --> 01:24:52.710]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:54.710]  This is amazing.
[01:24:54.729 --> 01:24:56.069]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[01:24:56.869 --> 01:25:03.609]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[01:25:04.409 --> 01:25:16.250]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the saw palmetto.
[01:25:16.369 --> 01:25:22.689]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, saw palmetto is That's insane.
[01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:23.130]  Look it up.
[01:25:23.289 --> 01:25:25.630]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:27.869]  It's got the trifecta going.

[01:25:49.449 --> 01:25:53.250]  at thealexjonesstore.com and it's going to keep the broadcast on the air.
[01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:54.090]  That's a win-win.
[01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.970]  Please take action.
[01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:59.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:13.890]  It's 1234 Central Standard Time PM and even mainline diplomats, mainline military leaders, world leaders at emergency session of parliament of the threat of imminent nuclear war.
[01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:24.890]  The German Chancellor says do not bomb Russia with high-powered strategic Cruise missiles that Biden authorized completely out of his mind in Brazil yesterday.
[01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:27.489]  The border is still wide open.
[01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:29.390]  Giant human trafficking going on.
[01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:31.609]  Inflation's out of control.
[01:26:31.869 --> 01:26:33.770]  The left's running around, law-faring everybody.
[01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:37.670]  The Justice Department is arresting more Trump supporters.
[01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:42.470]  Just absolute, total bunker town.
[01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:51.409]  Meanwhile, Trump to declare national emergency over illegal alien deportation operations once in office, 62 days from now.
[01:26:52.149 --> 01:27:01.229]  The president has called for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine many times, saying it could lead to World War III. Now we've gotten much closer to that.
[01:27:01.789 --> 01:27:05.609]  We have the Democrats openly trying to steal a Senate seat.
[01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:13.229]  Videos of them, I played yesterday, we'll play them again, saying we don't care what the law is, we're going to let people vote repeatedly, and we don't care if they're registered.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:17.600]  Now there's been arrest made in Pennsylvania over it.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:30.060]  You are seeing desperate establishment holding a nuclear war gun to our head in an attempt to keep Trump out of office or hand him a full war.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.220]  We could not have a more informative guest joining us today.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:43.100]  On this, he spent a lot of time, we had a long conversation, a lot of time with the president, a lot of private time talking with the president.
[01:27:43.479 --> 01:27:49.000]  Obviously, we won't reveal all of that here on air, but it gives Roger a very clear picture of The appointments and where Trump's going.
[01:27:49.239 --> 01:27:51.180]  But make no mistake, Trump is swinging for the fences.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.539]  He is at war with the deep state.
[01:27:52.899 --> 01:27:56.300]  Open discussions of court-martials for the treasonous globalist generals.
[01:27:56.579 --> 01:27:57.560]  That needs to be done.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.939]  They've committed serious crimes.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:02.140]  We have to go on the offense or they'll put us on the defense.
[01:28:03.039 --> 01:28:06.399]  So Roger, all of this is going on.
[01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:07.819]  All of this is unfolding.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.420]  And then obviously you want to talk about this.
[01:28:10.579 --> 01:28:11.760]  I haven't talked about it yet.
[01:28:13.699 --> 01:28:22.420]  The Onion and the National Everytown Brady Center group that I've explained was behind the lawsuits the whole time raising money off my name.
[01:28:23.319 --> 01:28:25.359]  Saying that I was harassing him and doing stuff I never did.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.640]  Having judges find me guilty in rigged courts.
[01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:29.279]  Then having a rigged auction.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.579]  The judge killing the auction.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.840]  The media trying to cover it up.
[01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:34.000]  Now it's all of the news confirmed, as I told you.
[01:28:34.859 --> 01:28:42.020]  And now we have the counter lawsuits filed, which I have not even announced or talked about yet in any detail.
[01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:43.800]  Red-handed.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:52.060]  They thought if they attached to the bid after they admitted they rigged it, that they chose to give it to them instead of the highest bidder.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.500]  That that would somehow make it legal.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:10.960]  And so in this document, Overhead Shot Please, that I posted on X, it's also on Infowars.com, this is just the lawsuits and injunctions from the highest bidder that I've been working with for years.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.300]  This is just that.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.500]  It has all the exhibits in it.
[01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:26.250]  Where they put in the bid that they controlled the bid and decided to not give it to the highest bidder and did not even use real money as their bid.
[01:29:26.449 --> 01:29:28.029]  Yes, you heard me.
[01:29:28.069 --> 01:29:46.720]  It's like they were trying to, like if you were getting your law degree and they said write a fictitious theoretical case of bid rigging and make it as absurdist and over the top as you could My lawyers,
[01:29:47.039 --> 01:29:53.460]  and one of them is one of the top guys, he's been practicing almost 50 years, said to me, he said, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.680]  He goes, it is absurdist.
[01:29:56.619 --> 01:29:58.579]  And then they kept it secret until after.
[01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:05.810]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, This is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:18.029]  I mean, what do the Democrats think they would do when they would ship in 325,000 kids, erase their histories, and hand them out to people in Walmart parking lots and fields and airfields?
[01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:21.970]  I mean, or start World War III. Like, hey, let's bomb Russia with heavy missiles.
[01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:23.550]  Oh, yeah, that's a really good idea.
[01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:25.970]  I mean, this is just emblematic.
[01:30:26.569 --> 01:30:27.710]  This is the Democratic Party.
[01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:30.270]  Went on Good Morning America and admitted they'd been running the whole thing.
[01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.890]  I told you.
[01:30:31.979 --> 01:30:32.899]  The FBI had been on the stand.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.619]  They ran the whole thing.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.039]  The CIA got caught being involved.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.300]  But now they just hid it.
[01:30:36.439 --> 01:30:40.000]  Roger, I want to get into Trump and the big picture here, but I know you were in the middle of this.
[01:30:40.039 --> 01:30:41.020]  You got a great group to come in.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.140]  That all got ignored.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:48.100]  What do you make just as this being emblematic of the total cuckoo land?
[01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:50.460]  And again, in Pennsylvania, I have the videos.
[01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:51.859]  They're saying, we don't care what the laws.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.640]  We're going to just let people vote multiple times.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:58.800]  And now they've arrested election judges for openly saying, yeah, I let illegals vote.
[01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:04.289]  I let people vote multiple times, or I let unregistered vote, and there's like, Trump is bad.
[01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:05.270]  I mean, here's the clip.
[01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:06.630]  Trump is bad, so we're doing it.
[01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:14.130]  I mean, what the hell is going, what would you call, historically, you've been involved for 50 years in politics, you've worked for four or five presidents.
[01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:20.229]  Is this just them going completely, is this the final stage of Trump derangement syndrome?
[01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.109]  What is this, Roger?
[01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:24.050]  I think, Alex, that's precisely what it is.
[01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:25.270]  First of all, they're in shock.
[01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:28.949]  They lost the last election by the margin that they did.
[01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.390]  They are apoplectic.
[01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:32.489]  They're hysterical.
[01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:43.409]  They are clinging to power and they intend to use every bit of that power to try to hamstring and thwart the incoming Trump administration.
[01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:47.649]  Let's get to the big picture first because I think it's obviously more important.
[01:31:47.829 --> 01:31:53.770]  If we have a thermonuclear war and America is destroyed, it won't really matter who owns Infowars, will it?
[01:31:53.989 --> 01:31:55.609]  So, let's start there.
[01:31:56.170 --> 01:31:57.810]  This is really not surprising.
[01:31:58.069 --> 01:32:14.890]  If you looked at it two weeks ago, after the election, after it was known that Donald Trump would be president, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said, we're gonna get as many dollars out the door to Ukraine between now and the time Trump becomes president as we possibly can.
[01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:17.590]  Alex, the people voted for peace.
[01:32:17.789 --> 01:32:20.149]  The people voted for an end to this conflict.
[01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:27.869]  The people voted overwhelmingly for Trump because he correctly said he can resolve this peacefully and do so quickly.
[01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:33.710]  This morning I had General Michael Flynn, America's general, former national security advisor.
[01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:40.449]  One of the greatest men it's ever been my privilege to know, by the way, a patriot, Christian, a great man.
[01:32:40.949 --> 01:32:48.909]  And it is his belief that the Ukrainians and the Russians at this point, they want to end the conflict.
[01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:53.810]  But that will not be allowed by those controlling Ukraine.
[01:32:53.949 --> 01:32:55.970]  That would be our own State Department.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:33:07.079]  Just the fact that there have been no ongoing peace talks, no ongoing negotiations, demonstrates that this administration is not interested in stopping the killing.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.720]  They're interested in shipping as much money to Ukraine as possible.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:23.270]  And now, with the incoming Trump administration, they are seeking World War III. Their attitude kind of is, if we can't control it, then let's destroy it.
[01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:26.029]  You see this across the board.
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:33.560]  Adam Schiff, On CNN yesterday, recycling the same crap about Russian collusion.
[01:33:33.699 --> 01:33:36.180]  No, Adam, you came up snake eyes.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:46.399]  No, Adam, no Trump campaign advisor was sharing proprietary polling information with a Russian intelligence asset.
[01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:47.560]  That's a lie.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.460]  It's a disproven lie.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:55.500]  First of all, there was no proprietary Trump polling information.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:56.699]  Trump hadn't polled yet.
[01:33:56.939 --> 01:34:12.239]  So any information that Paul Manafort, the campaign official in question, shared with Konstantin Kalimnik, a US intelligence asset, as proven by Matt Taibbi and other independent journalists, could have been read in the newspapers.
[01:34:13.039 --> 01:34:19.119]  So Adam Schiff once again recycles the same crap over and over and over again.
[01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:21.560]  These people are demented, Alex.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:27.880]  They're out of their minds because the American people have spoken, and they've spoken loud and clear for peace.
[01:34:29.069 --> 01:34:44.670]  Let me ask you, I think Trump needs to come out with a major press conference against World War III. It's the right thing to do, and it'll make him a hero, reiterate all the things he's already said, call for an immediate ceasefire to de-escalate this, and call out Biden's competency, point out that Kamala was selected,
[01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:47.029]  and that they basically admit that Biden's not running things.
[01:34:47.310 --> 01:35:00.010]  So demand to know who in the National Security Council made this decision, who is in charge, And I think Trump ought to get on an airplane, fly to D.C. and show up and say, Biden's not here.
[01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:01.029]  He's not the president.
[01:35:01.390 --> 01:35:02.130]  Stop it.
[01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:05.369]  And as the incoming president, walk in there and demand.
[01:35:05.649 --> 01:35:09.590]  And for people that don't know, new presidents, incoming presidents already start getting briefings.
[01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.989]  So he has a legal right.
[01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:13.390]  He needs to call an emergency session of Congress.
[01:35:14.029 --> 01:35:16.189]  And he needs to go full on on this.
[01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:17.930]  Because obviously, it's not obviously.
[01:35:18.069 --> 01:35:18.630]  I predicted this.
[01:35:18.729 --> 01:35:19.210]  It wasn't hard to predict.
[01:35:19.369 --> 01:35:25.489]  Their last insane card is World War III. Or escalate the war out of control and then hand him a total disaster.
[01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:29.310]  But again, all the mainline analysts agree the closest nuclear war ever.
[01:35:29.449 --> 01:35:32.069]  This is worse than the damn Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:37.170]  And so, I mean, we've got to take this very serious, Roger.
[01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:39.930]  What would you advise the President to do right now on air?
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.560]  Well, I think the president has to be very careful, of course, because he is the president-elect.
[01:35:44.779 --> 01:35:48.260]  And as the president-elect, he really does not yet have authority.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:36:00.840]  Sure, he has already said, I believe I read this this morning on his social media, he's called on Zelensky and Putin to meet with him immediately together to see if we cannot resolve this.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:04.340]  Remember, Donald Trump is first and foremost a deal-maker.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:12.060]  And he has the attention of both of those world leaders who I think, frankly, trust him more than they trust the current administration.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.960]  Yes, Roderick, just to be clear, two years ago he put out a video, a year ago, that's what's gone viral.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.260]  It's more pertinent today than when he said it, it's ultra green.
[01:36:20.439 --> 01:36:21.640]  So there it is.
[01:36:21.779 --> 01:36:26.319]  I'm saying he needs to reissue this immediately, and he has a right to...
[01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:34.810]  To the national security briefings, and I'm saying with his bully pulpit, I'm saying he needs to come and say, I'm not in yet, but the people have a mandate.
[01:36:35.069 --> 01:36:40.050]  I want to know who made this decision and make the point that clearly Biden is not in control.
[01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:42.189]  I mean, as a citizen, I have a right to say that.
[01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:45.210]  So I'm saying he needs to use his power now.
[01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:59.989]  Well, Alex, it's not clear how much power he has right now, and this Justice Department might have the audacity to charge him under the Logan Act, because you can't negotiate on behalf of the United States when you are not president of the United States.
[01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:08.109]  So, look, I'm not a lawyer, and I could be wrong about that, but these people are intent on doing two things before he takes office.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:12.479]  They want to start World War III. They also want to crash this economy.
[01:37:12.659 --> 01:37:18.479]  They want to hand him a flaming wreck of an economy.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.619]  That's how bitter they are about losing power.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.460]  That's how shocked they are about losing power.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.939]  Look, Trump is on top of this day and night.
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.180]  He wants to stop the killing.
[01:37:30.399 --> 01:37:36.600]  He knows that he can negotiate an agreement And he knows that they're trying to outflank him.
[01:37:36.739 --> 01:37:37.859]  Well, yeah, Roger, Roger, Roger.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.000]  The Logan Act is not going to be used.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:40.680]  It's never been used.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.560]  But let's just move back here for a moment.
[01:37:43.159 --> 01:37:51.319]  How about starting with John Kerry, who conducted his own personal foreign policy during the four years of the Trump administration?
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.199]  Well, yeah, with North Korea, Iran, China, everything.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.319]  But let's just look at this.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.680]  He's already met with Zelensky and...
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.800]  Musk over the phone.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.220]  He's already in conversations.
[01:38:01.239 --> 01:38:01.960]  That's admitted.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:02.520]  That's good.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:14.960]  He as a citizen, but also as the president-elect, has a right to say Biden's clearly not in control and call on the American people to demand peace as a citizen.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.479]  And he's already said all this.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.699]  I'm saying he needs to say it again in a press conference.
[01:38:18.819 --> 01:38:19.279]  Don't you agree?
[01:38:19.819 --> 01:38:20.340]  I do.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.159]  I do agree.
[01:38:21.399 --> 01:38:25.880]  And look, I'll just hope that he's watching this show because he likes alternative media.
[01:38:26.079 --> 01:38:26.659]  We know that.
[01:38:27.159 --> 01:38:28.560]  But look, I trust Trump.
[01:38:28.739 --> 01:38:29.699]  He's on top of this.
[01:38:30.039 --> 01:38:33.100]  He wants to end this conflict as soon as he can.
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.920]  And he knows how to do it.
[01:38:35.079 --> 01:38:39.380]  And he has the will and the support of the American people behind him.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:40.720]  We voted on this.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.619]  We voted for peace, not more war.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:52.579]  And that's my point is- We have the referendum, and this is the most dangerous point in modern history, the most inhuman history, because we have the weapons to destroy ourselves.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:56.100]  How do we get people to have extreme urgency?
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:03.939]  Well, I think General Flynn made this point on my show this morning, which is, the Ukrainians are not anxious to launch these missiles.
[01:39:04.809 --> 01:39:19.109]  And the Russians are not anxious to retaliate, although they've made it clear, Putin's made it clear that he will retaliate if he is attacked by a non-NATO nation, that would be Ukraine, using NATO-supplied missiles.
[01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:33.829]  So at this juncture, the only one who wants to launch these missiles to hit targets deep inside Russia are either Joe Biden or the people acting with the authority of Joe Biden, who's probably asleep at this moment.
[01:39:34.579 --> 01:39:41.020]  So let's walk through how this hurts America, how this hurts Trump.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:48.319]  Is it just to hand him an escalated disaster, make it so big and horrible it's hard to reverse, or are they crazy enough to actually be trying to start a nuclear war?
[01:39:49.090 --> 01:39:50.470]  Alex, they hate America.
[01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:56.729]  What better way to hand Donald Trump a flaming wreck than to start a world war and a crashed economy?
[01:39:56.949 --> 01:40:09.109]  So this is like pouring glue into the locks on the desks before the incoming administration, which actually happened when the Clinton people left.
[01:40:09.319 --> 01:40:11.800]  And they were replaced by a Republican president.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.359]  So, yeah, it is precisely what they want to do.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.680]  I think cooler heads are going to prevail.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:31.260]  I was happy to see General Flynn was fairly confident that this wasn't going to happen because he recognizes that neither the Ukrainians nor the Russians want nuclear war.
[01:40:31.399 --> 01:40:32.239]  They're being pushed.
[01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:35.119]  The Ukrainians are being pushed by our State Department.
[01:40:35.949 --> 01:40:41.989]  That's right, and by Zelensky, he was like, yes, war missiles, start bombing now, but their own military knows this is insane.
[01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:50.949]  So, expanding on that, shifting into the rest of the Trump agenda, Trump to declare national emergency to conduct mass deportations.
[01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:52.310]  We're in a national emergency.
[01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:56.529]  Let's talk about his agenda, the appointments, how's that going?
[01:40:57.130 --> 01:41:01.550]  Well, first of all, in Tom Homan, he has selected absolutely the right guy.
[01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:05.630]  He didn't put him as the head of ICE. He gave him a broader authority.
[01:41:05.789 --> 01:41:08.369]  He's essentially the immigration czar.
[01:41:08.609 --> 01:41:14.350]  Homan is a tough talking, straight talking guy who gets the job done.
[01:41:14.909 --> 01:41:17.210]  The president has great confidence in him.
[01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:18.729]  Homan's also a realist.
[01:41:18.789 --> 01:41:27.850]  He wants to focus first On those illegals in the country who have criminal records, either criminal records here or criminal records in the countries they came from.
[01:41:28.029 --> 01:41:29.510]  They will go first.
[01:41:29.649 --> 01:41:38.689]  For those who say this can't be done, it's never been done, President Dwight Eisenhower deported 1.3 million illegals.
[01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:43.289]  Holman is absolutely the right guy for this job, and he has a plan.
[01:41:43.489 --> 01:41:44.789]  He's putting together his team.
[01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:47.170]  I think he's going to move extremely aggressively.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:42:04.319]  I am very pleased that the president understands the importance of the political realignment that he's founded with Robert F. Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard and Rod Blagojevich and other people who used to be Democrats, but who have common sense,
[01:42:04.319 --> 01:42:08.300]  who actually believe in capitalism and freedom and free speech.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:22.890]  And he's come through with his commitment to appoint Robert Kennedy to the highest When it comes to health policy in the country, I think Kennedy faces a tough confirmation.
[01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:36.149]  But then all of the president's appointments face a tough confirmation because the Democrats are not going to give up We're good to go.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.460]  Instructions of Donald J. Trump.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.319]  Every one of them knows that.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.699]  They've been chosen in many cases for their skills and their confidence.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:20.720]  We anxiously await the appointment of an FBI director because, incredibly, story that broke yesterday, long before a crossfire hurricane.
[01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:34.189]  There was an off-the-books infiltration of the Trump campaign with two very attractive FBI double agents who were reporting directly to James Comey.
[01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:37.430]  I refer to Washington Times story by Carrie Pickett.
[01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:38.670]  This is shocking.
[01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:41.750]  This makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:43.310]  These are called honeypots.
[01:43:43.529 --> 01:43:49.489]  So they weren't operating on the basis of any evidence of wrongdoing or foreign involvement with Trump.
[01:43:49.689 --> 01:43:51.270]  They were just fishing.
[01:43:51.510 --> 01:44:03.449]  They were putting good looking women into the campaign entourage, the traveling entourage to try to collect information regarding the president or his campaign staff.
[01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:05.609]  This is outrageous.
[01:44:05.989 --> 01:44:11.479]  And this predates Crossfire Hurricane, There's a whistleblower who's come forward.
[01:44:11.619 --> 01:44:13.279]  I believe he has proof of all of this.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.939]  James Comey is clearly guilty of treason.
[01:44:17.159 --> 01:44:18.039]  There's no other way to put it.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.319]  Oh, I've had him try to put sex operatives on me.
[01:44:21.859 --> 01:44:24.340]  It's just absolutely ridiculous, Roger.
[01:44:24.939 --> 01:44:25.380]  So...
[01:44:26.369 --> 01:44:32.710]  Grading things right now, I would give Trump an A+. The corporate media has totally collapsed.
[01:44:32.909 --> 01:44:43.850]  What do you make of psycho Joe and his psycho wife Brzezinski coming out and endorsing or saying Trump's a great guy and he met with them?
[01:44:43.989 --> 01:44:45.170]  I mean, they have no viewers.
[01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:46.010]  They're a joke.
[01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:51.170]  And I'm not mad at Trump, but Why get his enemies even close to him when they have no power?
[01:44:51.289 --> 01:44:53.970]  It's one thing if your enemies have a lot of power, keep your enemies close.
[01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:56.250]  But, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[01:44:56.250 --> 01:44:59.869]  And you've got Alexander Soros saying nice things about Trump now.
[01:44:59.890 --> 01:45:05.109]  He's also praising World War III. I mean, I just hope Trump just stays away from these people this time.
[01:45:05.569 --> 01:45:09.789]  I haven't gotten the straight story on Joe and Mika.
[01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:13.630]  I saw a tweet this morning, although I'm not sure it was correct.
[01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:17.729]  Look, they loved Donald Trump right up until the moment they didn't.
[01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:27.670]  In the first administration, Mika actually made a number of personnel recommendations for globalists that were actually hired by the administration.
[01:45:27.869 --> 01:45:33.609]  And Joe loved laying by the pool at Mar-a-Lago, drinking Donald's booze and eating his food.
[01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:39.489]  That was right up until the time that Joe Scarborough learned that he was not on the shortlist for vice president.
[01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:40.949]  No, I'm not kidding.
[01:45:41.369 --> 01:45:47.909]  He actually thought that as a former member of Congress and somebody with the media presence, that he should be vice president.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:55.159]  And once he was not selected for vice president, it was only then and only then that they both turned on Trump with a vengeance.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.939]  Now, I'm all for dialogue.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:13.729]  I remember Trump telling me that when he went to see Bill Clinton, And when he went to see Barack Obama, when he was president-elect, they both said to him, you know, your number one problem in the world is the North Koreans.
[01:46:13.949 --> 01:46:15.130]  That's the number one problem.
[01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:18.789]  You've got this rogue madman, probably got nuclear weapons.
[01:46:18.949 --> 01:46:20.010]  That's your number one problem.
[01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:21.949]  And Trump said, okay, well, what's he saying?
[01:46:22.369 --> 01:46:23.329]  He said, saying?
[01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:25.149]  Yeah, what's he saying?
[01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:26.930]  So we don't know what he's saying.
[01:46:27.069 --> 01:46:28.130]  We're not speaking to him.
[01:46:28.670 --> 01:46:29.970]  And Trump said, that's crazy.
[01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:35.430]  If a guy has nuclear weapons, wouldn't you, or you think he does, wouldn't you want to be in a dialogue with him?
[01:46:35.529 --> 01:46:41.909]  Wouldn't you want to try to figure out where his head's at and see if you couldn't resolve things and maybe lessen the tensions?
[01:46:42.909 --> 01:46:45.289]  And of course, that's exactly what he went and did.
[01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:51.750]  Remember, they told us, if you elect Trump, he's gonna start World War III. Well, who's starting World War III? It's not Donald Trump.
[01:46:51.949 --> 01:46:54.970]  They told us, if you like Trump, the stock market will crash.
[01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.750]  Remember that?
[01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:59.130]  We had record stock market levels under Donald Trump.
[01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:05.470]  Look, he is on top of this situation in Russia and Ukraine.
[01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:12.890]  I am hopeful, by the way, that Rick Grinnell will be appointed as a special envoy to help bring a conclusion to this fight.
[01:47:12.949 --> 01:47:14.270]  He's a very able guy.
[01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:20.010]  Passed over for Secretary of State, but I hope he is, and I believe he is, still willing to serve.
[01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:22.430]  This would be a perfect job for him.
[01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:24.609]  He's a former ambassador to Germany.
[01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:25.010]  Roger.
[01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:30.289]  Former director of national information, national intelligence, pardon me.
[01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.750]  Roger.
[01:47:30.989 --> 01:47:32.010]  He's the ideal for such a...
[01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:33.170]  We gotta go to break.
[01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:34.489]  You're doing 15 more minutes with us.
[01:47:34.569 --> 01:47:38.329]  I got a bunch of topics and things I want to raise, but what else is gonna be on your radar when we come right back?
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:46.939]  It's a little gazy auction of the assets of Infowars because, yes, I was involved with a bidder group.
[01:47:47.039 --> 01:47:50.199]  Now, I only have sweat equity in because, you know, I have no money.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:53.260]  I was wiped out by Robert Mueller.
[01:47:53.359 --> 01:47:57.920]  But I have been working with a good group of individuals, and we put in a cash bid.
[01:47:59.289 --> 01:48:00.689]  Hold on, we've got to go to break.
[01:48:00.869 --> 01:48:01.130]  Stay there.
[01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:03.670]  We're going to get into all this, and the breaking news on that is big.
[01:48:03.949 --> 01:48:05.050]  It's bigger than us.
[01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:07.750]  It's just a mindset of these crazy stonezone.com.
[01:48:07.869 --> 01:48:09.930]  We'll start the next hour here in just a few minutes.
[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:12.529]  Speaking of that, I am suing them all.
[01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:16.770]  I am countersuing them, not just in this, but in the case itself.
[01:48:17.050 --> 01:48:18.670]  We are on the warpath.
[01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:21.050]  There's no more games with these people.

[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.319]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.159]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:31.720]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.439]  They are a private agency.
[01:49:33.819 --> 01:49:38.079]  Some of the president-elect's advisers have suggested that you should resign.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:40.819]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[01:49:41.279 --> 01:49:41.619]  No.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:48.340]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:49.039]  No.
[01:49:49.279 --> 01:50:02.260]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:09.539]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:23.680]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration It's where the ESGs come from.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.260]  It's where the global governance comes from, the corporate social credit scores, all of it.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:33.760]  And President Trump is striking right at the heart of it, going after their predatory loans.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.140]  Now, in closing here, Infowars is set to be sold At auction, Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[01:50:41.319 --> 01:50:44.000]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:46.439]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[01:50:46.619 --> 01:50:48.800]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[01:50:49.039 --> 01:50:58.140]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:05.109]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:15.630]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[01:51:15.909 --> 01:51:16.750]  Here it is on screen.
[01:51:17.369 --> 01:51:17.930]  Iconic.
[01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:28.449]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[01:51:29.199 --> 01:51:40.199]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:46.699]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[01:51:47.319 --> 01:51:49.979]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[01:51:50.359 --> 01:51:52.020]  Back to back to back.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.039]  That's right.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:52:00.920]  He's the only president to ever run three times, and he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[01:52:01.119 --> 01:52:02.039]  He won in 16.
[01:52:02.039 --> 01:52:05.430]  He won in 2020 and he won in 2024.
[01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:09.130]  But this time the landslide was so big they could not stop him.
[01:52:09.329 --> 01:52:11.029]  This is historic.
[01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.909]  We've won the battle.
[01:52:11.989 --> 01:52:15.229]  Now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[01:52:15.369 --> 01:52:21.529]  And to do that he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60-70 million people a day right now.
[01:52:21.630 --> 01:52:26.829]  The most reach we've ever had thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[01:52:27.029 --> 01:52:55.960]  Everybody wants to hear what my Thank you so much.
[01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:20.710]  Alright, Roger Stone's with us another 20 minutes, and then I'm going to shift gears on all the other news and a bunch of clips and important things.
[01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:28.010]  But yeah, last night, I came in here loaded for bear to expose the insanity of what's happened here.
[01:53:28.289 --> 01:53:31.949]  And some stations don't carry this first five, so I'm going to kind of recap it then.
[01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:38.350]  And Roger, let's just wait to get into this for five minutes, because we now have over 430 radio stations.
[01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.810]  We're getting...
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:48.079]  Like five or six a day with the Streisand effect of all that's been happening and Trump getting re-elected and everybody trying to take us off the air.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:50.279]  So the Alex Jones networks exploded.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:57.319]  It had on the two feeds on it last night 14 million viewers on the live feed.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.020]  The clips got another 25 million last night just on that.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.600]  I didn't add it all up today.
[01:54:02.779 --> 01:54:04.220]  Our other feed had 6 million.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:05.819]  Another feed, 2 million.
[01:54:06.199 --> 01:54:08.760]  The clips, a quick look, about 10 million.
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:12.699]  We're probably at about 60 million clips watched of the show.
[01:54:13.159 --> 01:54:14.720]  And then at least...
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.039]  25 million watching it last night.
[01:54:18.779 --> 01:54:24.500]  It's building back up again today, just on X. So let's wait for those stations.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.600]  There's still a massive audience online, but I want to nail all this.
[01:54:27.699 --> 01:54:29.500]  But just the weirdness factor.
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:32.779]  Let's spend a few minutes on that and what this signifies for how crazy they are.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.859]  Then we'll talk about you being involved and your view where this goes.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:45.869]  But For people that don't know, they literally memorialized after the fact that it wasn't an auction, it was a secret sale, but they literally said, but it's Alex Jones, so it's okay.
[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:47.529]  They didn't pledge real money.
[01:54:47.989 --> 01:54:49.890]  They weren't even supposed to have an auction.
[01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:51.770]  The judge didn't even know they'd had an auction.
[01:54:51.989 --> 01:54:58.189]  I mean, it's, again, if you were trying to create something to be guilty, this is it.
[01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.970]  Does that make sense, Roger?
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:03.159]  Yeah, Alex, what it is, it's bid rigging is what it is.
[01:55:03.239 --> 01:55:05.020]  That's exactly what they've been caught doing.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:13.319]  So there was never any honest above board auction in which legitimate bids were weighed or analyzed.
[01:55:13.659 --> 01:55:17.079]  And based on the rules, That we read.
[01:55:17.199 --> 01:55:26.039]  First, you had to pre-qualify by demonstrating that you really had the cash to make the transaction if your bid was accepted.
[01:55:26.779 --> 01:55:28.659]  As I told you, I put in sweat equity.
[01:55:28.659 --> 01:55:32.279]  I have no money, but I do have knowledge and I have friends.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:45.069]  And we put together, I think, a very solid bid with good people who understand Infowars and how it works and Understand how the platform could go forward and continue to be the tip of the spear.
[01:55:45.409 --> 01:55:59.289]  Then we hear that the people from The Onion come along, they make a bid, but their bid is based on some vague promise of future cash that we may get from Alex Jones when he's finally, we extract every penny out of him.
[01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:06.609]  So they didn't put up an all-cash bid, but they seem to have some inside deal with the bankruptcy trustee.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.000]  So yeah, I said publicly, this stinks.
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:12.420]  This needs a thorough investigation.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.840]  Sounds to me, Alex, like you have an honest judge who's not going to let this pass because there are rules.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.060]  There are laws.
[01:56:20.779 --> 01:56:35.350]  I don't know Elon Musk, but I'm certain when I saw that he had filed the notice of appearance, I don't know how he could not object to To their efforts to take away your presence on X, what used to be called Twitter.
[01:56:35.529 --> 01:56:40.130]  The real Alex Jones, that's you, but they want to take that away from you.
[01:56:40.289 --> 01:56:43.270]  They don't want to even let you use your own name.
[01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:44.909]  You can't be Alex Jones anymore.
[01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:47.869]  Or you can't have the Alex Jones show anymore.
[01:56:48.029 --> 01:56:50.470]  This has never happened in the history of the United States.
[01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:55.029]  This has never happened in the history of any bankruptcy in the history of our country.
[01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:56.789]  So this is very clear.
[01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:58.090]  You are targeted.
[01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:59.470]  It's not even about money.
[01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:00.789]  They don't want your money.
[01:57:00.909 --> 01:57:01.510]  Not really.
[01:57:01.689 --> 01:57:04.250]  They just want to shut you up.
[01:57:04.449 --> 01:57:06.590]  They just want to close Infowars down.
[01:57:06.710 --> 01:57:14.869]  What they don't understand is If they are successful in taking Infowars away from you, they are just going to make you stronger.
[01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:20.090]  They're just going to be heard and seen and listened to on another powerful platform.
[01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:22.310]  Which is the Alex Jones Network and more.
[01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:25.930]  But what I'm telling you, Roger, is it's not just my lawyers.
[01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:27.930]  I've gone to other top lawyers that have read the documents.
[01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:28.550]  We have them all.
[01:57:29.369 --> 01:57:31.170]  This is cut-and-dry fraud.
[01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:32.750]  Not just the bid rigging.
[01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:35.329]  I mean, this is a big...
[01:57:35.329 --> 01:57:36.510]  These people went crazy.
[01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:37.130]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:52.630]  All right, Roger Stone is our guest here, and we're looking at the overall panic of the Democratic Party and their component deep state globalist operatives in other countries.
[01:57:57.149 --> 01:58:05.789]  A window into this insane world is the last federal trustee in the Infowars bankruptcy, not because of lack of funds, but because they're taking it over and trying to shut it down.
[01:58:06.449 --> 01:58:07.949]  They don't want money, they said.
[01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:12.850]  Tried to close the doors on May 31st with no court order.
[01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:15.289]  The judge fired him two weeks later at an emergency hearing.
[01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:22.710]  Then the judge said in the future there can be an auction, which I'd agreed to, but it's got to be open and transparent.
[01:58:23.770 --> 01:58:25.750]  They tried to not make it transparent, so we called for hearings.
[01:58:26.029 --> 01:58:29.510]  The judge said a month ago, you can't have the sale until we've had these hearings.
[01:58:29.729 --> 01:58:31.449]  The judge said that again Thursday in a hearing.
[01:58:32.649 --> 01:58:42.350]  They went ahead with this quote auction, changed the rules two days before, said it's not a public auction now, it's sealed bids, and we'll decide who wins, including people with less money.
[01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:44.670]  And then we said, you can't do that.
[01:58:44.710 --> 01:58:46.470]  He said, no, I have the authority to do it.
[01:58:46.529 --> 01:58:48.430]  We said, the judge's order doesn't say that.
[01:58:49.050 --> 01:58:50.310]  So they went ahead with it.
[01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:52.270]  Gave it to people.
[01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:55.750]  It's the big national gun control groups, who it is.
[01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:57.170]  That's who runs the whole thing.
[01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:58.970]  They admitted this Friday on Good Morning America.
[01:58:59.569 --> 01:58:59.930]  Everytown.
[01:59:00.170 --> 01:59:02.270]  It's the Brady Center group now, what it turned into.
[01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:04.229]  It's the Democratic Party.
[01:59:04.409 --> 01:59:05.329]  It is Soros on record.
[01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:08.369]  And the Onion is just the front group.
[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:10.970]  They're not even hiding that now because they were crowing and celebrating.
[01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:14.529]  And they're on TV. You don't get any severance.
[01:59:14.609 --> 01:59:16.729]  We're going to give your employees one bottle of brain force.
[01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.109]  They said that as a joke.
[01:59:19.710 --> 01:59:20.970]  And they didn't own it.
[01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:26.470]  And then Thursday they come in and the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department just orders the power to the studios cut off.
[01:59:27.210 --> 01:59:28.069]  That's why I left.
[01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:28.689]  I wasn't going to leave.
[01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:33.510]  They just cut the power and called the internet service providers and cut InfoWars off and cut everything else off.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:39.079]  So I went over to Alex Jones Network, got that fired up with only a few hiccups, went well, great job, crew.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:43.840]  And then they had the emergency hearing that Thursday, and the judge said, I didn't authorize this.
[01:59:44.239 --> 01:59:45.640]  Everybody should be deeply troubled by this.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:46.319]  We're going to have a hearing.
[01:59:46.939 --> 01:59:50.319]  And then we got the documents, finally, of what they'd done in the auction.
[01:59:50.319 --> 01:59:59.060]  That's in a lawsuit filed by the folks I was working with that were going to buy it, who did have real cash and did have the biggest bid, the only real bid.
[01:59:59.979 --> 02:00:00.979]  And there it is.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:04.279]  And the exhibits are all there.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:05.600]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:09.640]  How they did not disclose that it wasn't real money people were bidding against.
[02:00:10.039 --> 02:00:12.300]  They had a secret lever in the agreement.
[02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:22.670]  Where if people did ever bid more, they would just keep pledging more of the billion and a half dollars, which is on appeal, which you can't borrow money against, which wasn't allowed the sale.
[02:00:22.810 --> 02:00:27.489]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[02:00:27.569 --> 02:00:34.909]  And now, Roger, what are they going to do when all the corporate media except Bloomberg ran the headlines that they had it and it was theirs?
[02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:36.609]  And then the day after...
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.460]  When they announced they won at 8 a.m., the U.S. trustees here are cutting off the studio power.
[02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:50.340]  And then they go in the court that afternoon and say, we can't have his crew back in the building because the judge is like, well, it's still his company.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.840]  Well, we can't have them in the cup.
[02:00:51.979 --> 02:00:56.699]  They'll steal the equipment, our equipment, as if we didn't already have another studio set up.
[02:00:57.399 --> 02:01:03.399]  And, I mean, it's just they literally hijacked the building without a court order illegally.
[02:01:03.859 --> 02:01:06.119]  So this is insane, Roger.
[02:01:06.159 --> 02:01:07.000]  Where do you see this going?
[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:12.010]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me say I'm delighted to hear that we have a giant radio audience.
[02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:25.470]  If you're carrying the Alex Jones show, then you should go to the Red Apple Audio Network, which syndicates my great show at 77 WABC in New York, because if your audience loves Alex Jones, well, they're going to love Roger Stone.
[02:01:25.670 --> 02:01:27.329]  Sorry, but I had to get that plug in.
[02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:30.289]  Everything I know about radio, Alex, I learned from you.
[02:01:30.609 --> 02:01:35.609]  So this is an outrage, but I think justice is going to be done here.
[02:01:35.850 --> 02:01:37.409]  One of two things needs to happen.
[02:01:37.619 --> 02:01:48.560]  They need to have a new legitimate auction for these assets that is carefully monitored to demonstrate that it is honest and it's above board.
[02:01:48.739 --> 02:01:56.060]  Or they have to take and throw out their bid and take our bid because I believe we're the only other viable bidder.
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:58.359]  There are only two possibilities here.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.460]  It has to be one or the other.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:11.119]  But Alex, in all honesty, if you had not been able to get on the air And tell people what was going on, nobody would have known what was happening here.
[02:02:11.619 --> 02:02:17.779]  This is not about money, ironically, even though they've tried to destroy both of us financially.
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:28.640]  In your case, and to a lesser degree in my case, they just want to silence you because of your commitment to the truth.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.420]  That's what this is really about.
[02:02:30.939 --> 02:02:37.560]  I've talked to bankruptcy lawyers in preparing our bid They have never seen anything like this.
[02:02:37.579 --> 02:02:41.359]  These are people who've been in the business 20, 30, 40 years.
[02:02:41.399 --> 02:02:43.760]  They've never ever seen anything like this.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.380]  So you're being singled out.
[02:02:45.579 --> 02:02:48.800]  Why is the Justice Department even involved in your bankruptcy?
[02:02:49.359 --> 02:02:54.579]  Why are the intelligence agencies involved in a simple bankruptcy proceeding?
[02:02:54.859 --> 02:02:56.220]  None of this makes any sense.
[02:02:57.819 --> 02:03:03.520]  Well, it shows how they use any lever they've got to pull this stuff.
[02:03:03.659 --> 02:03:04.899]  I mean, that's what's going on, Roger.
[02:03:05.710 --> 02:03:24.250]  We're good to go.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:37.920]  I did actually, as one of my closing acts at the end of the Trump administration, argue a case about the US bankruptcy trustees who are the same folks here who are bedeviling Alex Jones and went in and shut him down.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:45.079]  And look, as you were describing, they have in connection with the private trustees that are set up and that they supervise.
[02:03:50.890 --> 02:04:01.010]  We're good to go.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.899]  That's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[02:04:08.979 --> 02:04:12.880]  I was looking at who the current director is of the US trustee program.
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:16.039]  It's a woman named Tara Twomey.
[02:04:16.159 --> 02:04:29.079]  And you better believe that when the Trump administration starts, That she's gonna get investigated, that how this bankruptcy of Alex Jones was investigated, how it was dealt with is gonna be investigated.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:35.500]  This is something that hopefully the judge will shut this down and say, look, I gotta review this, don't do anything precipitous.
[02:04:35.779 --> 02:04:43.539]  But if he doesn't, because he's been working on these proceedings for a long time and judges eventually get to the point where they wanna get things off their docket.
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:50.640]  What the trustees seem to be doing here to me, and these are people who are part of the Justice Department, right?
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:56.640]  I don't think that's well known that the US bankruptcy trustee program is part of the Justice Department.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:59.420]  The Justice Department's span is truly enormous.
[02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:01.739]  That needs to be investigated.
[02:05:01.739 --> 02:05:08.640]  And I think that we can probably count on Matt Gaetz as attorney general to do that kind of deep investigation, Steve.
[02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:17.819]  And so they're trying to clearly rush this out and shut Alex Jones down as a kind of demonstration of they're still in charge for the next 67 days or so.
[02:05:18.239 --> 02:05:20.420]  And they could live to regret that.
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:27.779]  And so I think people should be looking over their shoulder and thinking about whether they really want to be doing this to shut down an important media operation.
[02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:31.770]  Roger, I want to be one trillion percent ultra clear here.
[02:05:32.949 --> 02:05:39.130]  I was ready if they outbid us to have the left take it over.
[02:05:39.829 --> 02:05:45.289]  But I challenged in court them saying that they would own my name and that they would be able to use it against me.
[02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:49.090]  Then when they claimed they bought it, they came out and they said...
[02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:52.130]  We're going to confuse people.
[02:05:52.130 --> 02:05:59.289]  They were all over national TV. And we're going to say we're him and do UFOs and Bigfoot and Chupacabras.
[02:05:59.729 --> 02:06:01.670]  And it's going to be so much fun.
[02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:03.810]  And we're going to do all of this.
[02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.510]  Well, that's unlawful.
[02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:06.949]  And you can't do that.
[02:06:07.829 --> 02:06:12.069]  Chris Murray, the U.S. Trustee, said, well, Alex shows us to have a 13th Amendment so we can sell his likeness.
[02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:18.569]  I mean, it's just a wild-eyed, megalomaniac power grab like everything else.
[02:06:18.590 --> 02:06:31.529]  Like, why did Biden and Harris think with Mayorkas they could ship in, admittedly, it's way higher, the Border Patrol says, 325,000 kids the last four years and disappeared them on purpose, many in sex slavery and slave labor.
[02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:33.270]  New York Times reported on that a year ago.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:42.619]  I mean, what is going on in these people's brains to just press the pedal down, balls the walls, and do the most heinous crimes they can?
[02:06:43.159 --> 02:06:44.520]  Let me say a couple things.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.619]  First of all, Jeff Clark is one of the most able lawyers I know.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:53.880]  He was assistant attorney general under the Trump administration.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:07:00.060]  They're trying to destroy him because he had a different legal interpretation of the Electoral College Act.
[02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:02.989]  Then Jack Smith did.
[02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:09.470]  They're trying to ruin his life to try to disbar and take away his ability to practice law or to serve the next administration.
[02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:10.569]  He's a hero.
[02:07:10.909 --> 02:07:19.069]  All he did was zealously and honestly put forward his own independent legal opinion.
[02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:21.649]  By the way, he's a very, very good lawyer.
[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:23.250]  He's not political at all.
[02:07:23.409 --> 02:07:24.890]  He goes by the book.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:25.979]  Brilliant guy.
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.239]  They're trying to destroy him.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:36.779]  I was glad to see him speak out on this because I think it helped get people to understand what was really going on here.
[02:07:36.979 --> 02:07:53.210]  You're right, the folks at The Onion who didn't put up the money necessary to compete in an honest auction, who were somehow pledging some future monies that they were going to get from you, They were, I think, taking their victory lap a little too early here.
[02:07:53.489 --> 02:07:56.069]  All we want here is an honest proceeding.
[02:07:56.229 --> 02:08:03.770]  And if someone comes along with a better bid and the bankruptcy trustee in an honest proceeding awards it to them, fine.
[02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:05.210]  Life will go on.
[02:08:05.329 --> 02:08:06.789]  You'll be able to find Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:08.189]  I have no doubt about that.
[02:08:08.850 --> 02:08:14.930]  Roger, in closing, Trump's doing a great job.
[02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:16.229]  America's done a great job.
[02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:19.010]  But we've got 62 days left of the election.
[02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:21.010]  Other than World War III, what are they going to pull?
[02:08:21.289 --> 02:08:23.189]  And then what do you make of...
[02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:24.930]  I've already played this a couple times yesterday.
[02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:30.869]  I may play it again after you leave, but I'm sure you've seen the Bucks counting the rest of them saying, we don't follow law because Trump's a criminal.
[02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:33.750]  Yeah, we count people that can vote multiple times.
[02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:35.090]  Yeah, we don't need to register voters.
[02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:37.930]  They've now arrested an election judge for it who...
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:43.800]  What is this all about and will they successfully steal that?
[02:08:43.899 --> 02:08:46.439]  Here's the headline right here.
[02:08:46.539 --> 02:08:47.939]  Let me show it to TV viewers.
[02:08:48.779 --> 02:08:49.960]  This is Town Hall.
[02:08:50.359 --> 02:08:57.159]  PA Dems attempting to steal state or U.S. Senate election may end up in some serious legal trouble.
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:03.619]  Minnesota election judge arrested for allowing unregistered voters to vote in the 2024 election.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:16.600]  Election integrity win for Huntington Beach, California, as Judge Holt says they can proceed with voter ID. Pennsylvania election recount commissioners ignore the court ban, decide to count flawed ballots, and people can vote multiple times.
[02:09:16.859 --> 02:09:18.439]  I mean, this just goes on and on.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.880]  What in the world's going on here?
[02:09:20.159 --> 02:09:34.840]  Well, Alex, let me point out that under Article 1, Section 5, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution, It states that each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.
[02:09:35.079 --> 02:09:53.380]  That means that if the Democrats seek to steal the Senate seat in Pennsylvania by counting illegal votes, that is, votes of people who are not legally eligible to vote, well then the U.S. Senate majority can refuse to seat Senator Bob Casey on the basis of that theft.
[02:09:53.609 --> 02:10:02.390]  So at the end of the day, I actually believe that Dave McCormick will be sworn in as the U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, a Republican.
[02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:08.229]  I'm also concerned about Wisconsin, frankly, because it is impossible to have...
[02:10:08.619 --> 02:10:16.659]  100,000 ballots show up at 4 o'clock in the morning, and 99% of them go for the Democrat county.
[02:10:16.939 --> 02:10:34.979]  The Democrat dirty trickster, Mark Elias, he's the guy who showed up at my trial and argued that the judge should not let my defense attorneys have the CrowdStrike memo, because the CrowdStrike memo would have proved that there never was any Russian hack Of the Democrat National Committee,
[02:10:35.159 --> 02:10:38.739]  one of the underpinnings of the Russian collusion hoax.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.439]  They're busted in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:42.300]  They're busted in Wisconsin.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:55.119]  But in the end, the Senate majority, as they did in the case of Senator Wyman from New Hampshire back in the 60s, can refuse to seat somebody who has been illegally certified by the state.
[02:10:56.479 --> 02:10:58.800]  Roger, I want to raise one more point with you.
[02:10:58.979 --> 02:11:04.319]  RFK Jr., Health and Human Services, Moderna, Pfizer stock for their poison shots, plunging.
[02:11:04.979 --> 02:11:10.819]  Then this photo comes out of him on Trump Force One with...
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:12.479]  Don Jr.
[02:11:12.939 --> 02:11:16.279]  and the Speaker of the House and Elon Musk.
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:18.960]  We know Trump loves to buy everybody McDonald's.
[02:11:19.079 --> 02:11:23.960]  He did the whole, you know, fry cook thing at McDonald's, a nice populist, you know, thing he did.
[02:11:24.359 --> 02:11:28.079]  And then they make the joke that, you know, there's RFK Jr.
[02:11:28.239 --> 02:11:30.659]  being given the poisoned hamburgers, as he calls them.
[02:11:31.479 --> 02:11:34.189]  And People said, oh, he's a hypocrite.
[02:11:34.289 --> 02:11:34.989]  He's now eating it.
[02:11:35.069 --> 02:11:38.350]  Now, obviously, he's looking at it like he's been handed a dead rat.
[02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:45.550]  And people that don't know how much GMO and crap is in there, he's trying to get them to start frying and beef tallow again is actually good for you, not the seed oil.
[02:11:45.729 --> 02:11:47.390]  But I did see a comment, and I agree with you.
[02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:49.770]  This is kind of a Trump hazing ritual.
[02:11:50.489 --> 02:11:52.270]  But I think it's really, really hilarious.
[02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:54.350]  But that's kind of a doorway into RFK Jr.
[02:11:54.810 --> 02:11:57.409]  and just all the great ideas he brings to this.
[02:11:57.510 --> 02:12:00.989]  But just in general, RFK Jr., HHS, where do you see that going?
[02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:05.600]  And what do you make of this ridiculous Well, first of all, Alex, you were a bodybuilder, right?
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:06.739]  I was a bodybuilder.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:07.699]  Did you ever have a cheat day?
[02:12:07.899 --> 02:12:08.840]  I had a cheat day.
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.420]  Every once in a while, you ate something you weren't supposed to.
[02:12:11.619 --> 02:12:14.060]  So maybe Bobby took a bite of one hamburger.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:14.899]  It's not going to kill him.
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.699]  He certainly doesn't do it every day.
[02:12:16.699 --> 02:12:17.359]  He's healthy.
[02:12:17.779 --> 02:12:19.359]  And he's in great shape.
[02:12:19.649 --> 02:12:26.329]  Look, I question whether some of the administrative duties at HHS are gonna be kind of a pain in the neck.
[02:12:26.449 --> 02:12:32.869]  But what I do want is Robert F. Kennedy working with Donald Trump overseeing overall health policy.
[02:12:33.010 --> 02:12:34.930]  That's what the people voted for.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:37.340]  It was very clear on the campaign trail.
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:53.279]  Trump said, yes, I'm gonna seek the help of RFK to make sure that there's a scrutiny of how pharmaceutical drugs are approved in this country, to see that everything is indeed based on science, not on greed,
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:59.659]  and to deal with the question of chronic childhood, chronic disease, as well as obesity.
[02:13:00.159 --> 02:13:03.100]  Robert F. Kennedy is a very, very smart guy.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:05.180]  He's a friend of mine.
[02:13:05.319 --> 02:13:07.600]  We're not close friends, but I know him and I like him.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:11.079]  And I think he believes in America and believes in capitalism.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.739]  But here's what does impress me about him.
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:29.029]  I've never seen him in any interview or on any platform where he said something That when it was challenged, he could not cite multiple studies or documentation of his opinion, not once, not ever.
[02:13:29.229 --> 02:13:40.149]  So this idea that Robert F. Kennedy's a nut, no, he's a truth teller and he backs everything he says with a study or usually multiple studies that prove that he's right.
[02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:45.350]  If you haven't read his book on Anthony Fauci, it is an absolute must read.
[02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.869]  All right.
[02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:48.949]  Stonezone.com.
[02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:50.210]  A whole bunch of programs he does.
[02:13:50.329 --> 02:13:50.890]  Very popular.
[02:13:52.409 --> 02:13:53.210]  Last point.
[02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:53.850]  This is the last one.
[02:13:54.510 --> 02:14:00.189]  I know you watched the Tyson fight with Trump privately and spent a lot of time with him.
[02:14:00.829 --> 02:14:01.590]  How's Trump doing?
[02:14:02.199 --> 02:14:08.739]  We're good to go.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:19.000]  We're good to go.
[02:14:19.039 --> 02:14:39.500]  To choosing men and women, people like Tulsi Gabbard, for example, people like Robert Kennedy, people like all of his appointees, like Tom Homan, who are committed to the Trump America First agenda, not committed to a party agenda or not taking the job because they think their job is to save the world from Donald Trump.
[02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:42.689]  So in the end, the personalities don't matter.
[02:14:42.869 --> 02:14:49.890]  What matters is that he choose capable people because normally you say, well, personnel is policy.
[02:14:50.029 --> 02:14:54.630]  But in this case, Donald Trump is committed and he was a great president in his first term.
[02:14:54.710 --> 02:14:55.630]  Let me make that clear.
[02:14:55.949 --> 02:14:58.909]  He succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.
[02:14:59.170 --> 02:15:00.729]  We had no new foreign wars.
[02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:06.250]  He brought troops home without the countries they were leaving, collapsing into the hands of the enemy behind them.
[02:15:06.670 --> 02:15:21.069]  At the same time, he gave us the most robust He's a great president despite the fact that he had all these whislings and all these rhinos inside his administration trying to derail his agenda.
[02:15:21.250 --> 02:15:22.909]  Not going to make that mistake again.
[02:15:23.050 --> 02:15:25.810]  Under no circumstances will he make that mistake again.
[02:15:26.010 --> 02:15:28.729]  That's why he's being so deliberate in these decisions.
[02:15:28.970 --> 02:15:30.090]  Roger, talk to you soon.
[02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.569]  God bless.
[02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:32.829]  This is such a historic time.
[02:15:34.710 --> 02:15:37.850]  It's why they're trying to start World War III. It's all they have.
[02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:39.670]  Or big false flags, a race war.
[02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:41.369]  Almost no one's going to buy that.
[02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:44.390]  The system has some big problems.
[02:15:45.449 --> 02:16:11.380]  Now, Chase Geiser made this short little promo We're good to go.
[02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:14.250]  Because I'm not the wolf of Wall Street.
[02:16:14.449 --> 02:16:15.449]  I'm not selling people junk stock.
[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:28.010]  I'm promoting freedom and justice, getting Florida out of the water, stopping the fentanyl, stopping the human trafficking, stopping World War III, exposing the UN globalist plan to launch bioweapons on us to bring in planetary government that I predicted and then happened.
[02:16:29.489 --> 02:16:32.950]  But at the same time, it is a good parallel that I'm not leaving.
[02:16:34.229 --> 02:16:39.149]  And even if they, by some scam, do try to buy InfoWars again, it failed, by the way, folks.
[02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.969]  We're here in the building.
[02:16:41.129 --> 02:16:44.170]  I'm gonna sue them until the end of the world because they're not gonna use my identity.
[02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:45.149]  They're not gonna own my name.
[02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.930]  They're not gonna do it.
[02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:47.370]  This is still America.
[02:16:48.030 --> 02:16:51.370]  So here's that clip in case you missed it.
[02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:52.409]  Then I've got some more to say.
[02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:52.930]  Stay with us.
[02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:57.690]  For years, I've been telling you guys never to take no for an answer, right?
[02:16:58.010 --> 02:17:06.870]  You know, to keep pushing, to never hang up the phone until you get what you want because you all deserve it.
[02:17:09.159 --> 02:17:11.299]  You know this f*** deal that I'm about to sign?
[02:17:13.979 --> 02:17:15.819]  The f*** is that, you know?
[02:17:17.379 --> 02:17:18.399]  I'll tell you what it is.
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:22.760]  It's me taking no for an answer, you know?
[02:17:24.799 --> 02:17:28.139]  It's them selling me, not the other way around.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.059]  It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:45.940]  So...
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:47.139]  You know what?
[02:17:51.459 --> 02:17:52.739]  I'm not leaving.
[02:17:55.379 --> 02:17:56.700]  I'm not leaving.
[02:17:59.319 --> 02:18:00.819]  I'm not leaving!
[02:18:09.829 --> 02:18:11.129]  The show goes on!
[02:18:37.299 --> 02:18:38.739]  I want to fight the globalists.
[02:18:38.899 --> 02:18:39.700]  I'll never give up.
[02:18:39.819 --> 02:18:40.940]  I'll never sell out.
[02:18:41.079 --> 02:18:41.899]  I'll never back down.
[02:18:42.059 --> 02:18:44.659]  But I cannot do it without you.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:50.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have filed a whole bunch of countersuits in the last month.
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.180]  None of it's hit the news because they're scared.
[02:18:52.399 --> 02:18:54.219]  They had a conspiracy against my rights.
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:55.420]  The Justice Department ran it.
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:00.959]  I can tell you Trump, when his new Justice Department is planning to go after these people, I will break that news here.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.479]  I told you Musk was involved and it hit the news.
[02:19:04.159 --> 02:19:04.860]  Listen to me.
[02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:05.799]  This is a real fight.
[02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:11.010]  But I need your support, and I make it easy.
[02:19:11.229 --> 02:19:12.290]  Go now.
[02:19:12.569 --> 02:19:13.450]  Take action.
[02:19:13.729 --> 02:19:14.590]  You voted.
[02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:15.670]  You supported Trump.
[02:19:15.809 --> 02:19:16.450]  You donated money.
[02:19:16.590 --> 02:19:17.709]  That's how we overpowered him.
[02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:19.829]  You've got to keep this show on the air.
[02:19:19.909 --> 02:19:20.590]  That's a no-brainer.
[02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:21.489]  Do I need to tell you that?
[02:19:21.489 --> 02:19:22.110]  You know that.
[02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:24.329]  So I want to thank those that have taken action.
[02:19:24.329 --> 02:19:29.930]  I want to encourage those to go get a great Patriot shirt, a Trump 1 hat, a 47 hat.
[02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:35.190]  There's so many cool, new, amazing shirts on the site right now.
[02:19:35.329 --> 02:19:36.870]  Hoodies, you name it.
[02:19:37.710 --> 02:19:38.809]  Thealexjonesstore.com.

[02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.989]  The lowest price.

[02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:15.950]  We're going to have the winner in a couple days for the last truck and announce that.

[02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:19.010]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.569]  Stay with us.
[02:20:19.709 --> 02:20:25.870]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[02:20:25.870 --> 02:20:27.430]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[02:20:27.690 --> 02:20:33.270]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels over foreseen.
[02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:48.959]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party allied with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[02:20:48.959 --> 02:20:51.659]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.920]  But we can't control everything individually.
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:56.760]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:58.600]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[02:20:58.639 --> 02:20:59.620]  And I've got faith.
[02:20:59.799 --> 02:21:18.610]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and Antibiotic resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:22.530]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.
[02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:27.829]  And they're key to keeping us on the air if InfoWars is shut down next week, or if we're not shut down, continuing on here.
[02:21:28.090 --> 02:21:30.350]  We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing products.
[02:21:30.489 --> 02:21:34.629]  Now, we've got two new products at DrJonesNaturals.com that are staples.
[02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.719]  That are known and amazing.
[02:21:37.319 --> 02:21:43.020]  And these are high quality versions of it, the best organic sources and at very, very low prices.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.059]  Two new products, introductory price, limited time, 40% off.
[02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:51.379]  And everybody needs quercetin and everybody needs high quality CoQ10.
[02:21:51.639 --> 02:21:56.399]  And both of these are high quality, large doses at a very low price.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:03.159]  Most competing brands say of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average, are about $60 a bottle.
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:07.719]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:22:07.899 --> 02:22:11.920]  And then, of course, Quercetin Max, really strong, high-powered Quercetin.
[02:22:11.959 --> 02:22:14.600]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:21.819]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:22.639]  This is all on record.
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:23.219]  This is admitted.
[02:22:24.489 --> 02:22:30.790]  Improved exercise performance, cognitive health, diabetes management, skin health, immune support.
[02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:33.610]  You just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.
[02:22:34.049 --> 02:22:42.809]  Let's look at quercetin, antioxidant properties, immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, allergy relief, heart health, antiviral and antibacterial properties.
[02:22:42.889 --> 02:22:43.469]  That's the big one.
[02:22:44.010 --> 02:22:50.850]  Supports respiratory health, blood sugar regulation, improves exercise performance, brain health, cognitive, all of it.
[02:22:51.379 --> 02:23:01.479]  So these are amazing known staples that are so good for your body, your immune system, but not just so you have a better chance of not getting ill.

[02:23:25.909 --> 02:23:28.690]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.
[02:23:28.850 --> 02:23:30.270]  So we're going to continue our amazing work.
[02:23:30.370 --> 02:23:31.549]  We cannot do it without your support.

[02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.000]  All right, I got a bunch of news I want to hit.
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:08.239]  The great Chase Guiser does a great job at just nailing clip after clip covering masses of news.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:09.440]  He's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:24:09.719 --> 02:24:11.819]  Owen Schroyer back 3 p.m.
[02:24:11.899 --> 02:24:17.520]  in the original M4 studios today in an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[02:24:19.239 --> 02:24:25.180]  Look, I could talk all day about what happened last week, us being kicked out of the building.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:29.399]  For the second time, the first time, I said, I'm calling the police.
[02:24:31.879 --> 02:24:32.940]  You don't have a court order.
[02:24:33.799 --> 02:24:35.559]  And the judge fired him at the next hearing.
[02:24:36.559 --> 02:24:42.319]  I told the U.S. trustee, the new one, from the Justice Department, I said, you're making a big mistake.
[02:24:44.219 --> 02:24:47.459]  And I'm not going to leave.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:49.299]  I want a court order.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:50.979]  And he said, it doesn't matter.
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:52.520]  We're turning off all the internet right now.
[02:24:53.479 --> 02:24:54.860]  And they started turning everything off.
[02:24:54.979 --> 02:24:57.399]  So by the end of it, they cut us off at like 1037.
[02:25:00.239 --> 02:25:02.399]  I drove over 10 minutes, the other studio went on air.
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:04.899]  I barely showed up on time.
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:10.180]  That's why it was like five, six minutes of scrambling and disordered clips and stuff.
[02:25:11.559 --> 02:25:15.360]  But great job by the crew and all of us under pressure.
[02:25:16.239 --> 02:25:18.479]  Everything this new trustee has told us he hasn't done.
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.840]  So the crew didn't even know they could get their own personal belongings and their own personal laptops and stuff out of here.
[02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:30.229]  And then sure enough, they went to the emergency hearing that day that we filed.
[02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:33.930]  The judge excoriated them and said, we can't let them back in the building.
[02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.809]  They'll rob it.
[02:25:35.569 --> 02:25:47.370]  Well, you're the ones that have done things that are wrong and we've filed and folks have filed the information today with the facts.
[02:25:49.149 --> 02:26:03.629]  But Again, imagine what's going on now in the deep state, that they ran the headline all over the world, Japan, Russia, France, the news, Alex Jones' company, sold to the onion, highest bid, none of it was true.
[02:26:04.770 --> 02:26:13.409]  And here we are, back in the building, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, four days, and they don't know what to do.
[02:26:13.549 --> 02:26:15.409]  They are just apoplectic people.
[02:26:18.239 --> 02:26:26.159]  And this is emblematic, it's a snapshot, a microcosm of what they've done to America, what they've done to Trump, what they've done to you.
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:31.239]  So, this is a historic situation.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:33.899]  And I need your prayer.
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:36.420]  I need your word of mouth.
[02:26:37.639 --> 02:26:38.520]  Because we're in this together.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:40.559]  And we've got the bad guy's number.
[02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:42.139]  We've got their signature.
[02:26:42.379 --> 02:26:44.379]  We've got their MO. Modus operandi.
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.399]  And it is vital we stay on the air.
[02:26:47.559 --> 02:26:49.639]  They hate this broadcast.
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:52.299]  Because we know what we're talking about.
[02:26:52.379 --> 02:26:58.500]  And we have the guests and the callers and the crew and the reporters and the analysis and the documentaries and the special reports.
[02:26:58.639 --> 02:27:00.120]  We are kicking ass.
[02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:09.549]  We were still reaching 20 million people today when they had me shut down off everything but Infowars.com, Bandot Video, and 300 radio stations.
[02:27:10.569 --> 02:27:12.989]  And we'd always hover around 300 and 350.
[02:27:13.430 --> 02:27:15.450]  They move, they get sold, they change.
[02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:16.809]  Some little, some big.
[02:27:17.250 --> 02:27:18.530]  Still, big audience there.
[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:19.389]  That's how we survived.
[02:27:21.549 --> 02:27:24.209]  I told you we're over 400 radio stations last week.
[02:27:24.329 --> 02:27:25.469]  We're over 450 right now.
[02:27:26.729 --> 02:27:28.790]  We're hitting 5, 6, 7, 8 stations a day.
[02:27:28.889 --> 02:27:29.950]  We can't even keep track of it.
[02:27:30.819 --> 02:27:32.879]  And they're like, big stations, many of them.
[02:27:32.979 --> 02:27:34.520]  We're putting you on prime time.
[02:27:36.459 --> 02:27:38.620]  And we are being vindicated by the second.
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:40.379]  But it's not just us.
[02:27:40.579 --> 02:27:44.760]  We are, again, just an emblematic of things.
[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:47.020]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:49.639]  The general public's getting more awake by the minute.
[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:50.520]  They're pissed.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.020]  Populists are getting elected everywhere around the world.
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:56.059]  Globalists are in deep doo-doo.
[02:27:57.090 --> 02:28:04.729]  So what did they say in their war games from the World Government, North American Union, Secret Summit in Banff, Canada in 2006 that's in my film Endgame?
[02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:07.129]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:13.610]  Because FOIA requests were done to the federal government by Judicial Watch and by Lou Dobbs.
[02:28:13.909 --> 02:28:15.790]  They got thousands of pages of documents.
[02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:30.549]  And they said, we're going to use a viral release to bring in world government and a world ID. We're going to collapse the third world and use the giant migrant hordes to take over with reverse colonization.
[02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:36.250]  We're going to use the threat of war and currency collapse to bring in a new world government currency.
[02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:37.670]  Now it's all out in the open.
[02:28:38.049 --> 02:28:39.729]  It was a big deal to get those documents then.
[02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:45.829]  And we're going to use censorship and lawsuits to shut down everybody's free speech.
[02:28:46.149 --> 02:28:50.969]  So, they have to shut down shows like this to win.
[02:28:51.069 --> 02:28:55.629]  Because what they're pushing is lies and fraud and crap.
[02:28:58.590 --> 02:29:03.209]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:29:03.569 --> 02:29:09.629]  They wouldn't need to be lying, cheating, surveilling, stalking, harassing, all of it.
[02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:28.450]  If what they were doing was promoting common sense, God, country, family, prosperity, peace, and they have the job of saying, I'm the weirdo, Tucker Carlson's the weirdo, Donald Trump's the weirdo,
[02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:32.190]  anybody with a brain knows that's not true.
[02:29:32.610 --> 02:29:39.760]  That's why they gotta fight so that new people don't actually hear Trump's saying we need immediate ceasefire.
[02:29:39.959 --> 02:29:40.819]  We need to end the war.
[02:29:40.959 --> 02:29:42.079]  Putin needs to stop it too.
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:44.120]  Right now.
[02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:51.440]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are, great, let's start bombing Russia now.
[02:29:52.659 --> 02:29:54.139]  That's insane.
[02:29:55.959 --> 02:29:57.340]  That's megalomaniacal.
[02:29:57.459 --> 02:29:58.319]  That's satanic.
[02:29:58.459 --> 02:29:59.319]  That's dangerous.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:01.500]  That's really happening.
[02:30:02.020 --> 02:30:06.000]  And we're just sitting there with a gun to our head, them start blowing the Russian cities up and military bases.
[02:30:06.159 --> 02:30:07.639]  I mean, what do you think the Russians are going to do?
[02:30:08.059 --> 02:30:12.260]  Gee, what have they done for a thousand years when the Muslims invaded over and over again?
[02:30:12.379 --> 02:30:15.420]  And what they do to Napoleon, what they do to Hitler, on and on and on.
[02:30:20.399 --> 02:30:22.500]  The biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world.
[02:30:26.149 --> 02:30:32.170]  And then I see all these Democrats all over the place on why Harris lost.
[02:30:32.770 --> 02:30:34.350]  She was selected.
[02:30:34.350 --> 02:30:36.110]  She was installed as the nominee.
[02:30:36.290 --> 02:30:37.190]  They disappeared Biden.
[02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:44.969]  She had less than a 2% rating in the Democrat debates and dropped out before a primary ever happened.
[02:30:45.129 --> 02:30:52.950]  They went with the most unsavory person because she was their puppet and totally owned by them.
[02:30:55.530 --> 02:31:08.930]  Smart, dynamic, good-looking people, it's not always just good-looking, but it tends to go with it, have an innate, deep sense of justice and pride in that I can do this fair and square.
[02:31:09.329 --> 02:31:11.590]  I want to be successful, but not at your expense.
[02:31:14.909 --> 02:31:28.540]  And the scum of the left around the world that's been attacking since the French Revolution, that's who they are, that's where communism comes from, look it up, The Jacobins, the Illuminati, in the history books, launched the French Revolution.
[02:31:28.899 --> 02:31:30.620]  People think the Illuminati is something in movies.
[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:32.139]  It's like, oh, is that real?
[02:31:32.399 --> 02:31:33.260]  Yeah, it's real.
[02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:36.659]  Type in George Washington's letters about the Illuminati.
[02:31:37.739 --> 02:31:38.920]  They're in the National Archive.
[02:31:38.959 --> 02:31:39.479]  You can read them.
[02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:41.719]  Scans of his handwritten letters.
[02:31:42.659 --> 02:31:43.879]  Fighting the Illuminati.
[02:31:46.559 --> 02:31:48.780]  So, we're fighting the Illuminati.
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:52.020]  Because everything with them is an inversion.
[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:54.239]  They are not the illumined ones.
[02:31:54.399 --> 02:31:55.280]  They are not illuminating.
[02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:56.139]  God brings light.
[02:31:56.479 --> 02:32:00.260]  The devil always says he's God.
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:10.719]  This broadcast, and people will spin this because they're liars and are mentally ill or stupid, this broadcast is the real Illuminati.
[02:32:11.659 --> 02:32:13.860]  Illuminati just means light in Latin.
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.860]  This show is the disinfectant.
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:33.520]  But then, Adam Weishaupt, the Jesuit, Ingolstadt University, creates the Illuminati, came out in their own documents, they create the French Revolution, they create communism, that's where it all comes from, overthrow God's order, overthrow the family,
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:35.100]  break just everything.
[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:37.239]  If you know the Jacobins, you know it all.
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:43.159]  So, the real Illuminati is Jesus Christ.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:45.000]  Christ is the light of the world.
[02:32:47.069 --> 02:32:53.930]  But the devil then names his organization the light because he's the light bearer.
[02:32:54.329 --> 02:32:57.829]  God's reflection hits him.
[02:32:58.610 --> 02:33:00.270]  That's very esoteric.
[02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:03.370]  That's why Christ is the morning star.
[02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:05.450]  Lucifer is the morning star.
[02:33:05.629 --> 02:33:07.469]  It's not because they're the same person.
[02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:11.590]  It's because Christ is the real morning star.
[02:33:13.149 --> 02:33:15.610]  Lucifer pretends to be the morning star.
[02:33:16.649 --> 02:33:17.110]  You understand?
[02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:20.930]  So they claim they're bringing light.
[02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:22.069]  They're bringing darkness.
[02:33:23.709 --> 02:33:25.329]  They're bringing death.
[02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:27.110]  They're bringing war.
[02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:29.729]  They're bringing betrayal.
[02:33:31.770 --> 02:33:35.670]  And so that's what we need to understand here.
[02:33:36.409 --> 02:33:38.069]  And when you see...
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:47.940]  All these globalists on TV going, there's not inflation or inflation's not bad.
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:49.299]  Everything's wonderful.
[02:33:49.959 --> 02:33:51.120]  The borders are open.
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:51.620]  It's great.
[02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:54.000]  Oh, hell yeah, bombing Russia's wonderful.
[02:33:54.239 --> 02:33:55.280]  It's so yip, yip, hooray.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:02.860]  These are lost, deceived, fallen people in their positions of power because they sold out.
[02:34:04.319 --> 02:34:07.059]  But now civilization will collapse.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.559]  And they've already said it's collapsing.
[02:34:09.559 --> 02:34:12.620]  They want to organize that and use that for even more power in the Great Reset.
[02:34:15.819 --> 02:34:21.879]  And if we don't remove power from them, they are going to get us all killed.
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:27.219]  And I know I'm stating obvious here, but finally there was a...
[02:34:27.219 --> 02:34:29.340]  Folks, Trump got 70% of the vote.
[02:34:30.399 --> 02:34:31.719]  California has always been red.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:33.920]  And the Republicans have been terrible in the past.
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:34.879]  That's not even really a good thing.
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:36.920]  It was like two evil parties before.
[02:34:37.159 --> 02:34:43.180]  The Democrats are now fully New World Order, fully satanic, fully poisoned, fully cancered.
[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:49.489]  And we the people have a beachhead, and the Republican Party, we've expanded to try to fix things.
[02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:52.030]  It doesn't mean it's perfect, not perfect by a mile.
[02:34:56.430 --> 02:34:59.489]  But anti-globalists are being elected everywhere, as I said earlier.
[02:35:00.670 --> 02:35:13.430]  And very positive things are happening, and humanity is struggling back to find their survival instinct, their will to live, their will to say, no, I'm not a slave, and no, I'm not a bad person, and no, I'm not going to follow your corrupt evil orders.
[02:35:14.659 --> 02:35:15.479]  That's where we are.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:18.559]  So I have this clip here that's emblematic again of it all.
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:24.079]  Shatner is totally out of touch if he really thinks inflation's down.
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:27.139]  Here's a short clip of him with Bill Maher yesterday.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:29.780]  And like, I like William Shatner.
[02:35:29.899 --> 02:35:30.780]  He is ridiculous.
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:32.840]  He is funny.
[02:35:33.459 --> 02:35:38.399]  Him singing Rocket Man is, I mean, just, I've always loved William Shatner.
[02:35:38.979 --> 02:35:45.659]  I never even liked Star Trek, but I'll watch it when he's on it because he is hilarious unintentionally most of the time.
[02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:52.139]  I mean, I've gone and seen him twice when he came to Austin, like 20 years ago, then about 12 years ago for a spoken word.
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:57.840]  And he's not even a bad guy.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:13.549]  You know, I'm playing this because 90-something years old, And he is the type of liberal that actually believes he's trying to help people because he's worth probably a billion dollars.
[02:36:13.850 --> 02:36:19.670]  I mean, he co-founded Priceline, made reportedly over a billion dollars when he sold it.
[02:36:20.489 --> 02:36:22.889]  He's got all this best-selling author, everything.
[02:36:23.069 --> 02:36:41.139]  He's sitting there with giant horse ranches in Canada and Colorado and private jets, and there he is with Bill Amar, so out of touch, That he's telling people that everything is great.
[02:36:41.299 --> 02:36:43.040]  Guys, go to YouTube and get William Shatner Rocketman.
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:43.860]  I gotta play that now.
[02:36:44.219 --> 02:36:46.200]  I mean, it's just hilarious.
[02:36:46.559 --> 02:36:47.500]  It's well done, actually.
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.040]  But how unaware he is.
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:52.879]  It's not even bad.
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:54.780]  It's just that Shatner-esque thing.
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:58.299]  And him fighting Gore the Lizard.
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:36:59.420]  I mean, just the comedy.
[02:37:00.899 --> 02:37:02.540]  He's a great unintentional comic.
[02:37:06.619 --> 02:37:07.379]  And...
[02:37:07.379 --> 02:37:10.479]  The craziest part is...
[02:37:10.479 --> 02:37:13.340]  That doesn't matter.
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.760]  Here's a William Shatner clip.
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:18.340]  I can't...
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:19.500]  I don't know why...
[02:37:20.350 --> 02:37:21.709]  Why the Democrats lost.
[02:37:21.829 --> 02:37:25.309]  I don't understand why the Democrats lost.
[02:37:25.530 --> 02:37:29.209]  Well, people will be writing books about it for years, many reasons.
[02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:35.270]  Part of it was, you know, just Biden should not have stayed on so long.
[02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:36.489]  That I understand.
[02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:45.469]  But inflation, prices have come down, the economy is good.
[02:37:45.809 --> 02:37:47.090]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:37:48.430 --> 02:37:50.489]  Why they voted against her.
[02:37:50.649 --> 02:37:51.850]  Against the party.
[02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:56.010]  Oh, well, I certainly could go on and on about that.
[02:37:57.209 --> 02:37:59.909]  But basically, you know, people...
[02:38:00.879 --> 02:38:03.360]  She was not a great candidate, let's be honest.
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:08.059]  When she said, when they asked- Why isn't she a great candidate?
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:13.139]  She combined several trends of thought here.
[02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:18.120]  Black, woman- That's not a candidate.
[02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:21.420]  Those are, you know, that's identity politics.
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:23.600]  That's one of the Democrats- Those are elements.
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:26.260]  So let's show the footage again.
[02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:38.579]  Of Biden, right as he's announcing to bomb Russia, not knowing who he is, supposedly to a press conference, he wanders off, doesn't take questions, into the woods, they had to go get him.
[02:38:38.639 --> 02:38:39.360]  This is being reported.
[02:38:39.899 --> 02:38:41.780]  Right after he ordered World War III to start.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.600]  I mean, is this how the world ends?
[02:38:44.559 --> 02:38:51.459]  And then, play Mitch McConnell yesterday saying no recess appointments, even though Trump's getting them by law, of his appointees.
[02:38:52.079 --> 02:38:55.559]  Again, this is, is this how the end of the world ends?
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:00.520]  Happens with like evil turtles launching World War III. Here, go ahead and play it.
[02:39:00.979 --> 02:39:01.979]  We're gonna need a minute.
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:04.799]  Okay.
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:24.239]  Somebody else have a question.
[02:39:24.399 --> 02:39:25.219]  Please speak up.
[02:39:28.239 --> 02:39:30.239]  And Mitch McConnell, by the way, supports giving the missiles.
[02:39:30.579 --> 02:39:40.840]  So a guy that can't talk and doesn't know where he is has, as the leader of the Senate, agrees with Biden to start bombing Russia with huge missiles.
[02:39:44.299 --> 02:39:47.520]  I mean, would you let Mitch McConnell drive a car?
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:51.100]  No.
[02:39:51.559 --> 02:39:53.100]  Would you let Joe Biden drive a car?
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:54.540]  He can't ride a bicycle years ago.
[02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:55.100]  I mean...
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:40:15.440]  Again, I know I'm beating a dead horse here, literally, but to the government and the bureaucracies, to the people who thought they'd just kick us out of the building without a court order for the second time since May, it's all part of people that have gotten away with so much for so long.
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:20.520]  When the world turns against them, they just go, well, we'll just start World War III, or we'll just grab your building.
[02:40:21.770 --> 02:40:22.629]  Okay, where's the court order?
[02:40:22.750 --> 02:40:23.309]  We don't need one.
[02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:24.149]  Well, the judge said you did.
[02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:24.790]  No, we don't.
[02:40:25.129 --> 02:40:25.770]  Get out of here.
[02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:27.090]  Doesn't matter.
[02:40:27.209 --> 02:40:28.350]  We cut your power off.
[02:40:31.389 --> 02:40:36.549]  So, that's where we are.
[02:40:36.850 --> 02:40:39.670]  And so, Biden is now the rocket man.
[02:40:39.850 --> 02:40:48.790]  You know, Trump had called Kim Jong-un until he got on the table and he stopped all the nuclear testing and the rest of it to shoot missiles over the coast of Japan.
[02:40:50.959 --> 02:40:58.520]  Rocket man, but the real rocket man is now whoever controls Joe Biden that thinks, well, we'll just blame Ukraine for launching it.
[02:40:58.579 --> 02:41:01.520]  That starts World War III. We'll come out on top in the history books.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:04.120]  There won't be history books, you dumb bastards.
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:09.579]  And it's a bunch of committees and lawyers and BlackRock and the Rothschilds, and they're all sitting around.
[02:41:09.639 --> 02:41:10.360]  Let's get tough.
[02:41:10.459 --> 02:41:11.180]  Yeah, let's go ahead.
[02:41:11.399 --> 02:41:13.120]  Well, all the military experts say don't do that.
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:16.139]  Well, we don't leave that to the generals.
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:22.180]  Here is a William Shatner, though, we need a little comic relief.
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:22.579]  Here it is.
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:33.120]  She packed my bags last night, pre-flight.
[02:41:36.079 --> 02:41:36.940]  Zero hour.
[02:41:38.219 --> 02:41:39.040]  9 a.m.
[02:41:42.799 --> 02:41:45.200]  And I'm gonna be high.
[02:41:51.579 --> 02:41:52.959]  As a kite by then.
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:03.399]  Oh, I miss the earth so much.
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:05.659]  They're going to miss it.
[02:42:05.739 --> 02:42:07.940]  We're all dead in thermonuclear war, too, you dumbass.
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:12.620]  It's lonely.
[02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:15.260]  Out in space.
[02:42:18.299 --> 02:42:19.840]  On such a...
[02:42:30.629 --> 02:42:33.670]  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
[02:42:34.549 --> 02:42:42.549]  The touchdown brings me back again to find I'm not the man they think I am back home.
[02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:44.309]  Oh no, no, no.
[02:42:44.649 --> 02:42:46.129]  I'm a rocket man.
[02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:50.209]  Rocket man.
[02:42:52.409 --> 02:42:55.870]  Burning out his fuse out here alone.
[02:42:58.569 --> 02:43:05.049]  I think it's gonna be a long, long time to touch town, bring me round again and fight.
[02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:08.489]  I'm not the man they think I am at home.
[02:43:08.829 --> 02:43:10.149]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:12.750]  I'm a rocket man.
[02:43:14.969 --> 02:43:19.670]  A rocket man, burning on his shoes out here alone.
[02:43:27.209 --> 02:43:30.190]  Mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kid.
[02:43:32.329 --> 02:43:34.049]  In fact, it's cold as hell.
[02:43:38.629 --> 02:43:41.170]  And there's no one there to raise them.
[02:43:44.049 --> 02:43:44.950]  If you did.
[02:43:51.350 --> 02:43:55.430]  And all this science, I don't understand.
[02:43:58.829 --> 02:43:59.610]  It's just a job.
[02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:02.209]  Five days a week.
[02:44:17.409 --> 02:44:20.190]  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
[02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:23.370]  The touchdown brings me around again to find.
[02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:26.569]  I'm not the man they think I am at home.
[02:44:27.069 --> 02:44:27.690]  Oh, no.
[02:44:28.290 --> 02:44:28.930]  No, no.
[02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:31.469]  I'm a rocket man.
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:37.149]  A rocket man burning out his fuse out here.
[02:44:38.290 --> 02:44:38.889]  Alone.
[02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:46.209]  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
[02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:52.010]  The touchdown brings me around again to find I'm not the man they think I am.
[02:44:52.290 --> 02:44:54.469]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:44:54.909 --> 02:44:56.370]  You do the original Trump dance.
[02:44:56.610 --> 02:44:57.370]  It's man.
[02:44:58.270 --> 02:44:59.329]  Rocket man.
[02:44:59.729 --> 02:45:02.709]  Burning out his heels out here alone.
[02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:09.209]  And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:13.979]  And I think it's going to be...
[02:45:13.979 --> 02:45:25.159]  All right, well, the real rocket man is Elon Musk, the type of rockets we need to take us to Mars and space and off-world in a Type 1 civilization, not the type of rocket man that Joe Biden or Kim Jong-un are.
[02:45:26.209 --> 02:45:30.129]  No, our rocket man's Donald Trump, rocketing our economy, securing our border.
[02:45:30.229 --> 02:45:31.750]  There will be major corrections to the economy.
[02:45:31.889 --> 02:45:33.090]  There's no way around it.
[02:45:33.149 --> 02:45:34.250]  It's either that or total collapse.
[02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:36.989]  But we're going to bring the jobs back.
[02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:38.170]  We're going to cut the energy prices.
[02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:39.649]  We're going to secure the border.
[02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:43.030]  We're going to stop the collapse of our country.
[02:45:43.149 --> 02:45:46.930]  The globalists have made their move on Western civilization.
[02:45:47.889 --> 02:45:52.450]  The ideas of Western civilization are not compatible with their one-world government, with their Great Reset.
[02:45:53.239 --> 02:45:57.120]  And so we can be conquered and roll over and be slaves and die and be poisoned and eat bugs.
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:01.319]  Or we can stand up and declare our independence against the globalists and discover they're the problem.
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:01.860]  They're the enemy.
[02:46:01.979 --> 02:46:03.739]  They're the ones almost to control the world.
[02:46:04.159 --> 02:46:06.200]  And we can remove what they're doing.
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:08.639]  We can stand against every one of their policies together.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:16.780]  And Infowars can stay on the air if you support us, if you support the Legal Defense Fund by buying the products at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:46:16.799 --> 02:46:21.079]  And our great sponsor, my dad's company, with the great supplements, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:23.440]  But it takes action.
[02:46:23.559 --> 02:46:24.340]  It takes funds.
[02:46:24.479 --> 02:46:25.239]  It takes word of mouth.
[02:46:25.319 --> 02:46:25.940]  It takes prayer.
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:27.059]  It takes will.
[02:46:27.299 --> 02:46:28.200]  It takes courage.
[02:46:28.639 --> 02:46:31.500]  But I'll tell you, it takes more courage to bow down and be a slave.
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:47.639]  I don't know how anybody doesn't fight against the New World Order, because 99.9999% of us are on the receiving end of this tyranny, and even the tiny one-tenth of one percent that think that the ruling class will end up killing themselves in what they've set up, in what they're establishing.
[02:46:48.459 --> 02:46:50.180]  This is so common sense.
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:53.020]  I don't even see a choice here.
[02:46:53.579 --> 02:47:04.420]  Freedom and justice, the great awakening, the new renaissance, and the destruction intellectually by dismantling it peacefully with our actions of the new world order.
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:08.959]  There'll be more major live updates, special reports, and more at InfoWars.com.
[02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:09.959]  We're back in the studios.
[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:11.260]  The Onion didn't buy it.
[02:47:11.399 --> 02:47:12.899]  It was all a giant fraud.
[02:47:13.079 --> 02:47:13.639]  Stay with us.
[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:22.639]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight, and we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, DallasJonesStore.com.
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:36.299]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great Patriot backers, total Patriots, J-Sexers, you name it.
[02:47:37.379 --> 02:47:39.540]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.500]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:54.319]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[02:47:57.379 --> 02:48:01.579]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:04.739]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.

[02:48:12.260 --> 02:48:13.459]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:13.920]  That's right.
[02:48:14.079 --> 02:48:17.600]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:21.899]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.

[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:37.780]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.

[02:48:47.629 --> 02:48:49.930]  The winner of the sweepstakes we announced the 30th this month.
[02:48:50.149 --> 02:48:50.950]  You want to win?
[02:48:51.170 --> 02:48:52.090]  I know you do.
[02:48:52.270 --> 02:48:54.809]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[02:48:55.149 --> 02:48:57.469]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.

[02:48:59.950 --> 02:49:01.610]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:05.209]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[02:49:05.329 --> 02:49:06.969]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:09.770]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[02:49:10.090 --> 02:49:15.030]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[02:49:15.250 --> 02:49:16.270]  You're in the know.
[02:49:16.629 --> 02:49:18.489]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:19.709]  Free shipping.
[02:49:19.729 --> 02:49:22.870]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[02:49:23.049 --> 02:49:24.290]  It just goes on from there.
[02:49:24.850 --> 02:49:31.389]  So, thealexshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of thealexshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:33.719]  We're fighting the new world order.
[02:49:33.899 --> 02:49:35.620]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[02:49:35.799 --> 02:49:40.319]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:41.760]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[02:49:42.559 --> 02:49:43.500]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[02:49:44.079 --> 02:49:46.799]  It's up to you whether you want to back.
[02:49:47.399 --> 02:49:49.780]  The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:59.079]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[02:49:59.239 --> 02:50:06.340]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[02:50:06.479 --> 02:50:08.479]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.440]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[02:50:11.879 --> 02:50:12.680]  We've already...
[02:50:13.559 --> 02:50:14.639]  Just devastated them.
[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:17.799]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[02:50:18.079 --> 02:50:19.360]  The whole world's turning against them.
[02:50:19.879 --> 02:50:23.659]  They're super dangerous just to throw in the kitchen sink at us and try to keep control.
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:31.159]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these...
[02:50:31.879 --> 02:50:34.319]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[02:50:34.659 --> 02:50:36.120]  So, again, I don't give up.
[02:50:36.299 --> 02:50:38.979]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:42.639]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[02:50:42.799 --> 02:50:45.100]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[02:50:45.239 --> 02:50:46.579]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[02:50:46.739 --> 02:50:55.280]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[02:50:55.479 --> 02:51:00.280]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[02:51:01.649 --> 02:51:03.649]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[02:51:04.989 --> 02:51:06.129]  I mean, it's just...
[02:51:06.129 --> 02:51:07.430]  This is a joke.
[02:51:07.829 --> 02:51:08.950]  This is ridiculous.
[02:51:09.370 --> 02:51:10.510]  We're changing the world.
[02:51:10.649 --> 02:51:13.510]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:25.750]  When you have US senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[02:51:25.989 --> 02:51:27.510]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:31.860]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[02:51:32.059 --> 02:51:35.399]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:40.040]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:47.620]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[02:51:48.020 --> 02:51:49.280]  Think of their ignorance.
[02:51:49.909 --> 02:51:59.389]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[02:51:59.629 --> 02:52:03.149]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:09.409]  Land launch systems that can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[02:52:09.649 --> 02:52:11.709]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[02:52:12.879 --> 02:52:16.200]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia has developed systems that we don't have.
[02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:18.360]  It's on record the US has those systems.
[02:52:18.819 --> 02:52:28.040]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction, or MAD for a reason, because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[02:52:28.799 --> 02:52:40.040]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us, and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia, when that was all a giant lie.
[02:52:40.219 --> 02:52:42.000]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:49.569]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[02:52:49.709 --> 02:52:51.110]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[02:52:51.350 --> 02:52:56.950]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud levels that were foreseen.
[02:52:57.690 --> 02:53:12.649]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party, allied with the neocons, is cancer has been incredible.
[02:53:12.649 --> 02:53:15.350]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[02:53:15.649 --> 02:53:18.610]  But we can't control everything individually.
[02:53:18.610 --> 02:53:20.450]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[02:53:20.450 --> 02:53:22.290]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[02:53:22.450 --> 02:53:23.329]  And I've got faith.
[02:53:23.489 --> 02:53:42.309]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[02:53:42.670 --> 02:53:46.209]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.
[02:53:46.329 --> 02:53:51.489]  And they're key to keeping us on the air if InfoWars is shut down next week or if we're not shut down, continuing on here.
[02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:54.020]  We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing products.
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:54:00.420]  Now, we've got two new products at drjonesnaturals.com that are staples, that are known and amazing.
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:06.700]  And these are high-quality versions of it, the best organic sources and at very, very low prices.
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:10.760]  Two new products, introductory price, limited time, 40% off.
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:12.540]  And everybody needs quercetin.
[02:54:13.170 --> 02:54:15.129]  And everybody needs high-quality CoQ10.
[02:54:15.389 --> 02:54:20.090]  And both of these are high-quality, large doses at a very low price.
[02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:26.850]  Most competing brands, say, of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average are about $60 a bottle.
[02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:31.409]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:35.610]  And then, of course, quercetin max, really strong, high-powered quercetin.
[02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:38.290]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[02:54:38.809 --> 02:54:45.510]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[02:54:45.629 --> 02:54:46.309]  This is all on record.
[02:54:46.409 --> 02:54:46.909]  This is admitted.
[02:54:48.129 --> 02:54:54.469]  Improved exercise performance, cognitive health, diabetes management, skin health, immune support.
[02:54:54.690 --> 02:54:57.309]  I mean, you just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.
[02:54:57.670 --> 02:55:06.489]  Let's look at quercetin, antioxidant properties, immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, allergy relief, heart health, antiviral and antibacterial properties.
[02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:07.149]  That's the big one.
[02:55:07.770 --> 02:55:14.530]  Supports respiratory health, blood sugar regulation, improves exercise performance, brain health, cognitive, all of it.
[02:55:15.059 --> 02:55:25.159]  So these are amazing known staples that are so good for your body, your immune system, but not just so you have a better chance of not getting ill.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:28.879]  It's the overall general quality of life you're going to have.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:32.659]  So I take both of these now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:55:32.799 --> 02:55:34.920]  They're available for 40% off limited time.
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.860]  And if InfoWars shuts down next week, We're not going to have InfoWars store anymore.
[02:55:39.180 --> 02:55:49.520]  We're going to have our sponsors like drjonesnaturals.com and the alexjonesstore.com for the equipment, the satellite uplinks, the crew, the servers, the reporters, the writers, just all of it.
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:52.379]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.
[02:55:52.559 --> 02:55:53.959]  So we're going to continue our amazing work.
[02:55:54.059 --> 02:55:55.239]  We cannot do it without your support.
[02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:56.520]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:55:56.659 --> 02:55:58.299]  You need to get this wherever you get it.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:01.799]  If you got this stuff at Whole Foods, you know, they've got other great versions there.
[02:56:01.899 --> 02:56:03.579]  Everybody knows about Coruscant and CoQ10.
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:04.639]  These are established.
[02:56:04.819 --> 02:56:05.360]  These are known.
[02:56:05.579 --> 02:56:06.600]  These are the game changers.
[02:56:07.239 --> 02:56:08.139]  Get it from us.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:08.920]  Get high quality.
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:09.719]  Get a low price.
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:10.340]  Keep us on air.
[02:56:10.739 --> 02:56:11.920]  That's the win-win.
[02:56:12.559 --> 02:56:15.399]  Well, well, well, ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:16.639 --> 02:56:22.079]  And I'm your host, Chase Geiser, for the next 53 minutes and 54 seconds.
[02:56:23.139 --> 02:56:24.940]  What an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:56:24.959 --> 02:56:27.239]  I'm not sure if we're going to take calls or not this hour.
[02:56:27.239 --> 02:56:29.260]  I will give out the number if I start feeling it.
[02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:32.780]  But I do have an abundance of clips to share with you.
[02:56:34.090 --> 02:56:39.530]  And analysis as to what's going on and what has been happening and what will happen next here at Infowars.
[02:56:42.549 --> 02:56:53.629]  And it's hard to really hone in and focus on what's happening because the last two weeks have been such a whirlwind.
[02:56:56.719 --> 02:57:06.639]  Between the election victory, the landslide victory that happened, a Kamala cost, millions upon millions of people voting against Kamala Harris, millions more voting for Donald Trump than Kamala Harris.
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:17.360]  All the excitement around that, followed immediately by the illegal shutdown of Infowars for no reason, because whoever made that decision is a total retard.
[02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:22.120]  I don't know who made that decision or who complied with those orders, but all of the above, retarded.
[02:57:26.989 --> 02:57:31.649]  And then just getting it back and then there's this emergency hearings and there's these new filings happening right now.
[02:57:33.629 --> 02:57:37.530]  Where we lay out in this, I think it's a 53 page document right here.
[02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:38.870]  53 page document.
[02:57:40.450 --> 02:57:51.870]  From our friendly bidder here laying out all of the collusion and rigging and the algorithms that were set up to automatically bid higher even though it was supposed to be a sealed private auction.
[02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:58.930]  I just can't wait to see what the judge has to say about all of this whenever this emergency hearing takes place.
[02:57:58.930 --> 02:58:00.930]  I believe it's scheduled for seven days from today.
[02:58:03.229 --> 02:58:11.790]  And I can say, honestly, that I have no idea what's going to happen to Infowars long term.
[02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:18.629]  I don't know if it's going to be shut down next week or if there's going to be another auction in a month and then it's going to really be shut down or if we're going to have total victory.
[02:58:19.790 --> 02:58:36.770]  But I can say with absolute 100% certainty that if you continue to support us at thealexjonesstore.com specifically by signing up for the VIP program at thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, that no matter what happens in this time of confusion and chaos and disorientation,
[02:58:36.930 --> 02:58:41.450]  we will ensure that Alex Jones stays on the air and that this crew is able to continue to fight the good fight.
[02:58:44.360 --> 02:58:59.379]  And in case you've forgotten how dire the situation is because of all the good news that we've had over the last two weeks, what with Trump winning the election in a landslide, the House turning to the GOP, and not the neocon GOP, but the MAGA GOP, the Senate turning to the GOP as well.
[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:03.879]  It seems like victory after victory after victory, it's easy to sit back and say, we got this.
[02:59:04.020 --> 02:59:07.059]  It's easier to sit back at halftime and say, we're up by three downs.
[02:59:07.239 --> 02:59:08.719]  There's no way they're going to come back.
[02:59:11.180 --> 02:59:17.059]  But everybody knows that it's possible for the tide to turn despite endless, countless victories.
[02:59:19.579 --> 02:59:26.000]  Everybody knows that you can win every single battle, but if you don't win the ultimate battle in a war, you can still lose the war.
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:46.379]  And I want to remind the audience how important it is to stay in the fight and realize how dire and vulnerable and dangerous the situation is right now, not just because We've got reports of British Airways having a major IT outage as flights are grounded and plane communications are lost all over Europe.
[02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:51.920]  And they're blaming it of course on an IT outage, but you're telling me that it wasn't Russia?
[02:59:52.579 --> 03:00:10.959]  You're telling me that the long range missiles that have just been authorized to strike Russia Which would automatically trigger World War III according to Russia's own proclamations and declarations dating back to at least September of this year, where they said, look, if you use long-range missiles, then we are justified in using nuclear weapons in order to defend our territory.
[03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:13.299]  You're telling me that Russia has nothing to do with this?
[03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:24.920]  They have to call it an IT outage or an IT issue because if they acknowledge the fact that it was a cyber attack from Russia, then that's technically an act of war on the United Kingdom, right?
[03:00:25.770 --> 03:00:29.110]  And then the United Kingdom has to declare war with Russia and that escalates everything.
[03:00:29.229 --> 03:00:31.209]  So they're like, oh, it's a massive IT outage.
[03:00:31.649 --> 03:00:34.870]  Just like it's solar weather whenever our cellular networks go down.
[03:00:34.989 --> 03:00:39.350]  It has nothing to do or doesn't correlate at all with the fact that we're shooting down spy balloons over the country.
[03:00:39.629 --> 03:00:42.110]  And we shoot down a spy balloon and one of our F-35s disappears.
[03:00:42.329 --> 03:00:43.629]  Oh, it's just, we found it.
[03:00:43.709 --> 03:00:44.030]  We found it.
[03:00:44.110 --> 03:00:45.909]  We're not going to show you any pictures of what we found, but we found it.
[03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:47.250]  Here's a field that looks kind of burnt up.
[03:00:47.430 --> 03:00:49.629]  Here's one witness in a straw hat saying what he heard.
[03:00:50.209 --> 03:00:54.530]  In fact, guys, if you can find that video of the witness with the straw hat, it's okay if it's a remixed version.
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:00:59.299]  I want to remind the audience of what happened after the F-35 disappeared last fall.
[03:01:00.479 --> 03:01:01.540]  They said they found it.
[03:01:01.639 --> 03:01:03.500]  There was only one witness, and it was this guy in the video.
[03:01:03.579 --> 03:01:04.639]  He's a black guy with a straw hat.
[03:01:04.739 --> 03:01:05.579]  I mean, it's hysterical.
[03:01:07.639 --> 03:01:09.659]  We know that that plane was stolen.
[03:01:11.159 --> 03:01:17.079]  We know that these outages have happened, whether AT&T or Verizon or others over the course of last year, they're blamed on solar weather.
[03:01:17.989 --> 03:01:30.469]  We're in fact cyber attacks either from China or Russia or Iran or someone and then when when something like this happens where they have to ground entire Airlines worth of flights because of some software update.
[03:01:30.729 --> 03:01:31.969]  And they blame it on a software update.
[03:01:32.110 --> 03:01:38.729]  You realize that most hacks are actually put on software updates so that when you do the update, the hack is there.
[03:01:39.250 --> 03:01:42.649]  They don't usually hack existing operating systems.
[03:01:42.770 --> 03:01:47.590]  They'll hack the next update so you install it as you update the platform, the technology, the software.
[03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:55.069]  But it was definitely, in my opinion, Russia doing this.
[03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:57.530]  And they're acting like World War III isn't really escalating.
[03:01:57.590 --> 03:02:02.250]  And this is just to help our interests with supporting Ukraine, the only democracy in the area.
[03:02:02.250 --> 03:02:04.670]  We gotta keep Russia from invading all of Europe.
[03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:07.790]  And they pretend that there's no consequences for that.
[03:02:07.870 --> 03:02:09.569]  They pretend there's no blowback for that.
[03:02:09.649 --> 03:02:12.549]  I mean, Ron Paul for years has been talking about blowback after blowback.
[03:02:12.709 --> 03:02:14.909]  This is absolutely a dire situation.
[03:02:15.129 --> 03:02:20.030]  They're trying to sabotage our own national security to set up Trump for ultimate failure.
[03:02:20.969 --> 03:02:26.709]  And I tell you what, I would be very surprised if next year we don't have a very serious economic crisis.
[03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:30.829]  So they can blame it on Trump, but it will be happening despite him.
[03:02:31.770 --> 03:02:40.610]  You're gonna try to make it look like populism and his policies are responsible for economic crisis when it has nothing to do with him and everything to do with the fact that our entire monetary system is a total lie.
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:54.479]  And if you don't believe that it's dire, and if you believe that the Democrats are just admitting defeat here and yielding back and acknowledging that the will of the people has spoken, then just look at this clip here.
[03:02:54.639 --> 03:03:02.860]  This is clip number 38 from my list of what Destiny, the famous Omni liberal cuck, literally a cuck, not just colloquially a cuck, actually a cuck.
[03:03:04.340 --> 03:03:08.120]  Has to say about right-wing influencers, speakers, people on the Internet.
[03:03:08.299 --> 03:03:18.959]  This is voiced the sentiment of millions upon millions of brainwashed leftist NPCs, non-player characters in the United States of America and worldwide, right here in clip number 38.
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:26.280]  Conservatives have been disgusting for years, which is why I don't give a fuck about anybody that winds up at any of these rallies and gets shot or whatever the fuck, okay?
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:28.420]  Because they had no problem making fun of Paul Pelosi.
[03:03:28.559 --> 03:03:32.520]  The entire world would be better off if these people were permanently removed from these platforms.
[03:03:32.899 --> 03:03:40.600]  Like, there is no downside and only upside to see people like Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Tim Pool never be allowed to publicly broadcast their opinions ever again.
[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:42.559]  It's exclusively bad stuff that happens.
[03:03:42.809 --> 03:03:48.590]  Yeah, so very Hitlerian approach right there to handling political opposition.
[03:03:48.889 --> 03:03:56.670]  That's basically what leftism looks like on 200 milligrams of amphetamine, 200 milligrams of Adderall.
[03:03:58.290 --> 03:04:07.969]  I mean, amped up, clenching the jaws, just calling for the entire annihilation of a whole political disposition, a whole political orientation, a whole political philosophy.
[03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:11.190]  Just removed, not allowed to broadcast, don't care about freedom of speech.
[03:04:11.229 --> 03:04:14.030]  And when he says removed, does he mean just deplatformed or does he mean dead?
[03:04:14.809 --> 03:04:16.110]  Because I think that he means dead.
[03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:24.090]  Despite the fact that when I challenged him to a lawful duel under Texas Penal Code 22.06, it got over 100,000 likes on X. Millions upon millions of views.
[03:04:24.229 --> 03:04:24.850]  He blocked me.
[03:04:24.909 --> 03:04:25.950]  He said, I'm not going to duel him.
[03:04:25.989 --> 03:04:26.549]  I'm not going to duel him.
[03:04:26.549 --> 03:04:28.389]  I mean, those are fighting words, man.
[03:04:30.450 --> 03:04:36.829]  When he made fun of Corey Comparatore for being killed at a Trump rally, saying, ha, [...] that's when I challenged him to a duel.
[03:04:36.909 --> 03:04:37.809]  But he's not willing to fight.
[03:04:37.969 --> 03:04:39.549]  He thinks it's funny when we're killed.
[03:04:39.709 --> 03:04:43.209]  But then when we challenge him to a fist fight, he won't even do it.
[03:04:44.659 --> 03:04:51.420]  Because they want to weaponize the military and the state against their political opponents because they're too weak to stand up face to face against their own opposition.
[03:04:52.579 --> 03:04:55.379]  I mean, I have a genetic severe bleeding disorder.
[03:04:55.379 --> 03:04:57.020]  I've never been in a fight in my life.
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:05:08.620]  I am 100% confident that I could totally beat the living piss out of destiny, legally, lawfully, with consent, if we were to duel under Texas Penal Code 2206.
[03:05:09.100 --> 03:05:09.979]  Mutual combat.
[03:05:12.739 --> 03:05:13.479]  But he won't do it.
[03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:14.100]  The left won't do it.
[03:05:14.299 --> 03:05:16.459]  Instead, they want to weaponize the state against us.
[03:05:16.500 --> 03:05:18.159]  And we've seen it time and time again.
[03:05:18.379 --> 03:05:19.540]  I'm going to run clip number six here.
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:25.319]  This is Schiff still doubling down on the Russian collusion hoax.
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:27.079]  And I'm going to show you why this is so shocking.
[03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:29.860]  I mean, it's shocking, but not surprising.
[03:05:30.579 --> 03:05:33.840]  Because they're doubling down on the Russian collusion thing in multiple ways.
[03:05:34.139 --> 03:05:39.420]  Now, years later, after they were embarrassingly proven wrong about it.
[03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:39.760]  Six.
[03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:44.149]  Obviously he is bringing a group of people to disrupt.
[03:05:44.510 --> 03:05:46.190]  I mean, that is what Speaker Johnson said.
[03:05:46.969 --> 03:05:59.159]  And I'm wondering about how much anybody in Washington is being introspective at all about why there is this kind of opening for Disruptors, if not necessarily these individuals.
[03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:12.700]  You were censured in the House last year for, in their view, holding positions of power during the Trump presidency as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and according to them, quote, abusing this trust by saying there was evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:24.829]  And I wonder if you are feeling at all, introspective at all, about That was, according to the Mueller report and according to your Republican colleagues, an overstatement.
[03:06:24.889 --> 03:06:29.549]  And I wonder if you think in any way you helped set the table for these disruptors.
[03:06:30.030 --> 03:06:31.829]  First of all, it wasn't an overstatement.
[03:06:31.989 --> 03:06:33.610]  There is evidence of collusion.
[03:06:33.969 --> 03:06:39.530]  The Trump campaign manager was meeting with Russian intelligence and giving them internal polling data, just to give you one example.
[03:06:40.270 --> 03:06:42.549]  And the Mueller report sets all this out.
[03:06:42.850 --> 03:06:54.270]  It does say, quote, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities, which doesn't mean that there weren't meetings, but they didn't find evidence.
[03:06:54.489 --> 03:06:54.829]  He says that, too.
[03:06:54.930 --> 03:07:01.270]  He says the fact that we didn't find proof beyond a reasonable doubt doesn't mean there wasn't evidence of conspiracy or coordination.
[03:07:01.870 --> 03:07:04.950]  The fact that we didn't find any evidence doesn't mean that evidence doesn't exist.
[03:07:05.229 --> 03:07:06.170]  That's what Schiff just said.
[03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:09.250]  The economy is going to address inflation.
[03:07:09.770 --> 03:07:16.709]  And we didn't persuade the American people that we had a better answer to that question, that we had a better program, agenda, plan.
[03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:27.909]  And more than that, I think we failed to persuade the American people that in the voters' point of view, hey, that party, that candidate understands people like me.
[03:07:29.270 --> 03:07:29.909]  All right.
[03:07:30.069 --> 03:07:31.469]  Now let's go to clip number 34.
[03:07:31.469 --> 03:07:34.129]  This is them saying that Tulsi is a Russian asset.
[03:07:39.250 --> 03:07:40.469]  Clip number 34, please.
[03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:42.510]  Thank you.
[03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:58.889]  Tulsi Gabbard is someone who has met with war criminals, violated the Department of State's guidance, and secretly clandestinely went to Syria and met with Assad, who gassed and attacked his own people with chemical weapons.
[03:07:59.530 --> 03:08:07.590]  She's considered- Debbie Weisserman Schultz, famously fired for rigging the 2016 primary against Bernie, immediately got a job for the Clinton campaign in Florida.
[03:08:08.409 --> 03:08:09.750]  Is that how you consider her?
[03:08:09.930 --> 03:08:10.930]  Is that what you consider her?
[03:08:11.309 --> 03:08:11.649]  Oh, yes.
[03:08:11.850 --> 03:08:12.690]  There's no question.
[03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:16.270]  I consider her someone who is likely a Russian asset.
[03:08:16.709 --> 03:08:22.569]  I mean, Debbie Weisman Schultz up there, one of the most corrupt people in the history of politics.
[03:08:22.969 --> 03:08:30.489]  Somehow, miraculously, no matter how recently she showered or prepared for an interview, always looks like she's wearing the makeup from the night before.
[03:08:32.290 --> 03:08:38.149]  Coming out and saying that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset, right after Schiff says that Trump is a Russian asset.
[03:08:38.549 --> 03:08:44.270]  And then we have Brennan in clip number 26 saying that Tulsi has no perspective.
[03:08:44.489 --> 03:08:50.209]  Well, if she was a Russian asset, then she certainly would have perspective given to her by the Russians, first of all.
[03:08:50.370 --> 03:08:52.450]  Second of all, has no perspective.
[03:08:52.829 --> 03:08:59.510]  This is somebody who's actually been deployed in combat, deployed in areas that our deep state political class has ordered soldiers to go.
[03:09:00.370 --> 03:09:03.229]  When they themselves and their sons don't have to go at all.
[03:09:03.370 --> 03:09:10.590]  I mean, the closest the Bidens ever got to war was enlisting Hunter, but he got kicked out for having too much cocaine in his system.
[03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:14.569]  Here's Brennan in clip number 26 saying that Tulsi has no perspective.
[03:09:15.170 --> 03:09:17.909]  Brennan, your thoughts about Tulsi Gabbard?
[03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:27.139]  Well, Nicole, I think you and Tom Nichols have done a great job just underscoring all the concerns that people have about this appointment.
[03:09:27.819 --> 03:09:39.079]  Clearly, Tulsi Gabbard has taken actions and made statements over the past several years that really raise serious questions about her common sense, her judgment, as well as her political sympathies.
[03:09:39.420 --> 03:09:52.440]  Cosing up to Putin as well as to meeting with Bashar Assad, I think really does show that she doesn't have the type of perspective that is needed for somebody who's going to head up these 18 intelligence agencies.
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:55.879]  And as Tom Nichols said, she doesn't have any qualifications.
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:06.219]  The director of national intelligence, that's a really serious position and a very complex and complicated one that requires somebody who actually has an understanding of the intelligence community.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:07.719]  It's like an orchestra conductor.
[03:10:08.370 --> 03:10:13.430]  Of all the different agencies and departments that are involved in the intelligence process.
[03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:17.450]  And I don't think she understands even the instruments that are involved in this orchestra.
[03:10:18.010 --> 03:10:24.209]  Nor has she had any experience at the strategic level of running and leading a large complex organization.
[03:10:24.549 --> 03:10:30.370]  And the director of national intelligence is, according to legislation, the president's principal intelligence advisor.
[03:10:31.020 --> 03:10:37.219]  The person who is responsible for making sure that the president's daily brief is put together in a very sound and forthright manner.
[03:10:37.559 --> 03:10:41.739]  The person who puts together the budget and the priorities of the intelligence community.
[03:10:41.979 --> 03:10:55.579]  So I know that this appointment is sending shockwaves here in the United States, but also around the globe in terms of, is this really somebody who Donald Trump is going to entrust with the care and the leadership of the intelligence community?
[03:10:55.879 --> 03:10:58.120]  An unserious pick for a serious position.
[03:11:00.010 --> 03:11:01.709]  Well, that's shocking.
[03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:11.389]  She's got no perspective over the different instruments that make up this orchestra.
[03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:13.290]  That's what he says.
[03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:19.309]  And I don't know if the crew can find the clip from the Steve Jobs movie that was just called Jobs.
[03:11:20.010 --> 03:11:22.370]  Where Steve Jobs says, I play the orchestra.
[03:11:22.709 --> 03:11:25.250]  He's having a conversation with Seth Rogen.
[03:11:26.069 --> 03:11:27.229]  If you can find that clip, let me know.
[03:11:27.389 --> 03:11:28.430]  Sorry for throwing curveballs, guys.
[03:11:28.989 --> 03:11:31.469]  Didn't know I was going to host the fourth hour until an hour before.
[03:11:32.829 --> 03:11:38.430]  But he says she doesn't understand the instruments in this orchestra.
[03:11:38.690 --> 03:11:40.450]  Who plays the orchestra then?
[03:11:40.809 --> 03:11:41.690]  Is it Brennan?
[03:11:41.930 --> 03:11:43.209]  Is it the CIA director?
[03:11:43.469 --> 03:11:44.569]  Is it the FBI director?
[03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:48.069]  Is it Rothschilds?
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:52.479]  Some ghost behind the machine or within the machine that is the Federal Reserve.
[03:11:52.799 --> 03:12:00.540]  He's talking about the instruments of an orchestra that make up our deep state, but no one seems to know who actually runs the country.
[03:12:00.719 --> 03:12:04.500]  It's certainly not Joe Biden.
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:05.459]  Let's watch this clip.
[03:12:07.479 --> 03:12:08.399]  I was angry.
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:16.610]  You were saying things about the Apple II and the way you were treating the team was You get a free pass for life.
[03:12:17.250 --> 03:12:18.450]  I gotta get back on stage.
[03:12:18.610 --> 03:12:20.190]  We've got like two minutes of rehearsal time left.
[03:12:20.690 --> 03:12:23.469]  Do you understand how condescending that just was?
[03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.590]  Well...
[03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:25.450]  Maybe you don't...
[03:12:25.450 --> 03:12:26.909]  I don't want to see you get dragged off...
[03:12:26.909 --> 03:12:28.690]  I get a free pass for life from you!
[03:12:30.670 --> 03:12:32.049]  You give out the pass...
[03:12:32.049 --> 03:12:33.549]  You give them to me!
[03:12:33.709 --> 03:12:35.129]  You're gonna have a stroke, little buddy.
[03:12:35.270 --> 03:12:35.870]  What did you do?
[03:12:36.610 --> 03:12:37.530]  What did you do?
[03:12:40.670 --> 03:12:42.010]  Why has Lisa not heard of me?
[03:12:42.090 --> 03:12:43.870]  Man, how many fourth graders have heard of you?
[03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:46.700]  You can't write code.
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:48.239]  You're not an engineer.
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:49.260]  You're not a designer.
[03:12:49.659 --> 03:12:51.459]  You can't put a hammer to a nail.
[03:12:52.079 --> 03:12:53.540]  I built the circuit board.
[03:12:53.739 --> 03:12:59.739]  The graphical interface was stolen from Xerox PARC. Jeff Raskin was the leader of the Mac team before you threw him off his own project.
[03:13:00.579 --> 03:13:00.840]  Everything!
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:02.139]  Someone else designed the box!
[03:13:02.819 --> 03:13:06.920]  So how come 10 times in a day I read Steve Jobs as a genius?
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:10.000]  What do you do?
[03:13:10.459 --> 03:13:11.700]  I play the orchestra.
[03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:14.909]  Sorry, who plays the orchestra of our deep state?
[03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:24.489]  We've got Brennan up here talking about instruments of an orchestra, saying that Tulsi Gabbard does not have the perspective needed to run this operation.
[03:13:24.709 --> 03:13:31.569]  I want to know who's actually running this country, because I know it's easy to forget, given the news from the last two weeks.
[03:13:31.770 --> 03:13:34.670]  But Joe Biden is still technically the president of the United States.
[03:13:34.850 --> 03:13:40.270]  We know that for at least one year, he has not been doing the job of the president of the United States.
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:42.659]  But yet again, it has not been neglected.
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:44.719]  Someone has been operating the White House.
[03:13:44.899 --> 03:13:48.379]  I want to know who it is that's actually running this country.
[03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:57.100]  And I want to know, furthermore, whether it's even possible for a man to sit in the Oval Office and successfully operate this country with any sort of autonomy.
[03:13:58.100 --> 03:14:04.440]  Because it seems like every time we have a leader who has the audacity to attempt to do so, like Nixon, they get outed.
[03:14:04.540 --> 03:14:06.219]  Like JFK, they get assassinated.
[03:14:06.319 --> 03:14:11.739]  Like Donald Trump, they get attempted assassinated several times, at least twice, probably three if you count Tucson.
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:24.819]  And it seems to me that we have a deep state establishment that wants the United States itself to be a leaderless nation, which in and of itself is inherently a threat to our national security to have no leadership.
[03:14:25.219 --> 03:14:31.700]  Therefore, the deep state itself is a terrorist organization and committing treason with every breath that it draws.
[03:14:36.219 --> 03:14:38.059]  And the left wonders why they lost.
[03:14:38.399 --> 03:14:41.280]  And AOC is coming out and saying, we don't have to take no for an answer.
[03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:42.399]  We just have to keep trying again.
[03:14:42.639 --> 03:14:49.399]  And they advocate and pretend that they love democracy, democracy, the will of the people so much, but they constantly sabotage their own primaries.
[03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:53.260]  And then they had a coup in order to try to get Kamala Harris to win.
[03:14:53.379 --> 03:14:56.120]  And she lost the popular vote and the electoral college.
[03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:59.690]  And suddenly we don't hear them utter a word about democracy anymore.
[03:15:00.010 --> 03:15:06.149]  Let's listen to Bill Maher in clip number three, calling out the left, explaining to them why they just keep losing.
[03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:11.690]  I saw Kamala was on Saturday Night Live, as the losing candidate often is.
[03:15:13.069 --> 03:15:15.030]  It worked so well for Hillary.
[03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:16.370]  Let's run that back.
[03:15:17.069 --> 03:15:23.250]  And it just made me think, I'm sure every single member of the Saturday Night Live cast was a Harris supporter.
[03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:24.989]  But what if one of them wasn't?
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:28.899]  What if one of those cast members was for Trump?
[03:15:29.079 --> 03:15:30.940]  Would they have felt comfortable saying so?
[03:15:31.059 --> 03:15:32.299]  I really don't think so.
[03:15:32.659 --> 03:15:34.219]  They would have had to keep it to themselves.
[03:15:34.479 --> 03:15:36.340]  That's not a good place for us to be.
[03:15:36.639 --> 03:15:37.479]  I remember when...
[03:15:37.479 --> 03:15:41.659]  And that happens even more on the left.
[03:15:44.100 --> 03:15:48.079]  And I remember when Elon Musk hosted, and this is well before he was a Trumper.
[03:15:48.260 --> 03:15:49.260]  This is three or four years.
[03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:50.959]  He was just the richest man in the world.
[03:15:51.139 --> 03:15:55.420]  And a number of the cast members on Saturday Night Live, like, they didn't want to deal with him.
[03:15:55.780 --> 03:15:58.260]  They didn't exactly boycott, but they made it plain.
[03:15:58.420 --> 03:15:59.620]  And I was thinking, really?
[03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:02.459]  You have Elon Musk on your show for a week.
[03:16:02.600 --> 03:16:12.040]  You could talk to one of the most interesting, brilliant people the world has ever produced, even about this issue that bothers you so much that he's so rich and lots of people aren't.
[03:16:15.149 --> 03:16:16.409]  That's what I hate about the left.
[03:16:18.510 --> 03:16:21.569]  And there's Bill Maher, absolutely right, about half the time.
[03:16:21.569 --> 03:16:23.450]  Half the time, he hits the nail right on the head, doesn't he?
[03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:26.899]  And the crew did a great job.
[03:16:27.079 --> 03:16:28.139]  Awesome job finding the clips.
[03:16:28.239 --> 03:16:29.239]  They found this clip of the witness.
[03:16:29.399 --> 03:16:30.260]  I don't know if you guys remember.
[03:16:30.459 --> 03:16:33.719]  There was an F-35B. Disappeared for 24 hours.
[03:16:34.040 --> 03:16:36.479]  Military asked people to look out for it for a whole day.
[03:16:36.659 --> 03:16:41.059]  Then they found it, said it crashed right where it crashed because of weather, even though there was no bad weather.
[03:16:41.200 --> 03:16:43.079]  And then there was no footage of the actual incident.
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:44.319]  There was only one witness.
[03:16:44.540 --> 03:16:45.659]  This was the witness.
[03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:46.979]  And they said it wasn't hacked or stolen.
[03:16:47.159 --> 03:16:47.399]  Come on.
[03:16:47.659 --> 03:16:47.979]  Let's watch.
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:50.620]  In the bathroom taking a shave.
[03:16:51.299 --> 03:16:53.100]  And I heard a screeching.
[03:17:04.090 --> 03:17:08.930]  White says he didn't realize it was a plane at the time, so he didn't call anybody.
[03:17:13.450 --> 03:17:22.049]  The F-35B airplane wreckage created an extensive debris field.
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:25.079]  The wreckage is located off Old Georgetown Road.
[03:17:25.659 --> 03:17:30.520]  Military security is very tight with numerous red and white signs on the- People walking around.
[03:17:30.739 --> 03:17:31.459]  I mean, that's your witness?
[03:17:32.399 --> 03:17:35.860]  How much do you think they pay that guy to say that he heard something between a screech and a whistle?
[03:17:36.700 --> 03:17:39.079]  Do you think they gave him extra to actually make the sound?
[03:17:42.840 --> 03:17:43.579]  No, no, no.
[03:17:43.639 --> 03:17:45.360]  What happened was we're shooting down weather balloons.
[03:17:45.500 --> 03:17:48.540]  Everything's escalating between China over Taiwan and with Russia and Ukraine.
[03:17:50.239 --> 03:17:54.340]  There have been documents for 10 years saying that the F-35B had been hacked already.
[03:17:54.540 --> 03:17:58.459]  They were testing a software update just like what we're seeing from British Airways right now.
[03:17:58.819 --> 03:18:07.780]  And the F-35B is the only fighter jet, I believe, as far as I know, that was ever created that would have an automatic ejection seat in case the pilot was unconscious.
[03:18:08.219 --> 03:18:09.760]  They ejected the pilot.
[03:18:09.940 --> 03:18:11.100]  They stole the plane.
[03:18:11.260 --> 03:18:12.879]  They couldn't find it for 24 hours.
[03:18:13.020 --> 03:18:16.219]  When they realized it was stolen, they said they found it and that it crashed.
[03:18:16.299 --> 03:18:17.639]  They paid that guy to be a witness.
[03:18:19.690 --> 03:18:20.649]  Their only witness.
[03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:24.950]  I was brushing my teeth and I heard something between a screech and a whistle.
[03:18:25.069 --> 03:18:25.809]  He's got a straw hat.
[03:18:25.909 --> 03:18:29.309]  I mean, he looks like he's from a tobacco ad in the late 19th century.
[03:18:30.149 --> 03:18:31.909]  My, is that good tasting?
[03:18:34.129 --> 03:18:35.389]  Folks, we're coming up on a break.

[03:19:29.370 --> 03:19:30.370]  It's all set up.
[03:19:31.459 --> 03:19:39.620]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[03:19:40.659 --> 03:19:45.020]  So you're literally, in the information world, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[03:19:45.870 --> 03:19:53.389]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[03:19:54.250 --> 03:19:58.129]  So, we're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[03:19:58.870 --> 03:20:01.049]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.

[03:21:03.799 --> 03:21:06.200]  There are less than 27 minutes left of this broadcast.
[03:21:06.479 --> 03:21:12.360]  I am Chase Geiser, your host, until the great Owen Schroer takes over hosting the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:29.649]  As we are giving you breaking news, analysis, and information amidst the escalation of World War III, again, I know we've been saying it all year, but basically ever since this war has broken out between Ukraine and Russia, this totally unnecessary war every week has been an escalation,
[03:21:29.649 --> 03:21:43.590]  and now it seems we are finally on the verge of the total destruction of humanity, all while the deep state does everything within its power to take down Infowars, failing time and time again, and even if they do succeed, they will never take Alex Jones off of the air.
[03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:45.819]  I'm gonna play clip number 16 here.
[03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:54.540]  This is the left talking about the importance of installing a shadow government to undermine all of the initiatives of the Trump administration.
[03:21:54.540 --> 03:21:55.299]  Let's watch.
[03:21:55.809 --> 03:22:00.190]  Trump attempts to weaponize the justice system against his political opponents with Matt Gaetz at the helm.
[03:22:00.450 --> 03:22:08.290]  We could see incoming Senator Adam Schiff as our shadow Attorney General, arguing against replacing our independent prosecutors with Trump loyalists.
[03:22:08.610 --> 03:22:20.329]  If Trump seeks to eliminate the Department of Education, Congresswoman Johanna Hayes, a former Teacher of the Year, could step up as shadow Education Secretary to loudly defend public education in the United States.
[03:22:21.649 --> 03:22:38.229]  If Trump orders Marco Rubio to hand Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Congressman Greg Meeks, as Shadow Secretary of State, could be a strong voice in support of maintaining international relationships and protecting democracy at home and abroad.
[03:22:39.190 --> 03:22:55.149]  Senator Michael Bennett as shadow Treasury Secretary and Congresswoman Susan DelBene as shadow Commerce Secretary could help ensure the middle class and small businesses have a voice in government and call out Trump's proposed tax cuts for billionaires and corporations.
[03:22:56.100 --> 03:23:14.079]  A shadow defense secretary, Congressman Adam Smith, a great representative for the people of Washington and not a Fox News host, could counter Trump's threat to use military force against his political opponents and work to ensure that the Department of Defense stays loyal to the Constitution and not someone of the dictator.
[03:23:14.079 --> 03:23:17.100]  As if they care about the Constitution.
[03:23:17.420 --> 03:23:24.620]  And Senator Tammy Duckworth would argue against cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs that would delay the benefits and care our service members have so rightly earned.
[03:23:25.430 --> 03:23:37.969]  If Trump hands over the EPA to big oil ally Lee Zeldin, we could see Congresswoman Kathy Castor pushing back for environmental protection and conservation to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.
[03:23:38.729 --> 03:23:53.290]  And if Trump pushes to ban abortion nationwide, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro could step in as Shadow Secretary of Health and Human Services to defend women's right to choose and argue against the gutting of Medicare by Trump and his cronies.
[03:23:55.010 --> 03:23:55.250]  Mr.
[03:23:55.329 --> 03:23:57.430]  Speaker, new times require new solutions.
[03:23:58.049 --> 03:24:02.870]  The shadow cabinet isn't just about opposing extreme MAGA attacks on our government.
[03:24:03.270 --> 03:24:12.290]  I'm looking at this drab, super boring, oaky 70s wood paneling video, and this is what they do.
[03:24:12.549 --> 03:24:22.709]  What they do is they tell you in documents and at conferences And in hearings, exactly what they're going to do.
[03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:25.889]  But they make it so boring that nobody pays attention.
[03:24:26.129 --> 03:24:36.309]  He told somebody on his staff, probably some intern from George Washington University or something, I need you to make a shadow cabinet graphic.
[03:24:37.649 --> 03:24:45.209]  And the closest they could come up with was how the map looked in Battlefront 2 for the battle on Coruscant.
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:48.659]  Remember there was a little chamber behind the library archives?
[03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:50.340]  Top down, mini-map.
[03:24:51.819 --> 03:25:02.040]  And this guy goes up there and reads something which could very easily have just been emailed out to everyone in the most boring way so that it's totally disregarded.
[03:25:02.120 --> 03:25:05.840]  I mean, I felt guilty playing this clip for you.
[03:25:05.899 --> 03:25:06.739]  I had to show you.
[03:25:06.819 --> 03:25:09.620]  It was my duty to show you this clip so you understand...
[03:25:10.780 --> 03:25:12.700]  The shadow government that they're trying to put in.
[03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:22.559]  But I felt guilty doing it because my job is to keep you interested and paying attention and focused on the truth because we're one of the only places that will actually report it.
[03:25:22.719 --> 03:25:26.000]  And I knew that I was failing you by virtue of showing you this clip.
[03:25:26.219 --> 03:25:28.100]  This is the deep state psyop.
[03:25:28.319 --> 03:25:37.559]  Be as boring as possible about the total hijacking of the entire planet and humanity and every government and the conglomeration of all political power into one world government.
[03:25:37.559 --> 03:25:40.020]  Be as boring as possible so nobody notices.
[03:25:40.969 --> 03:25:43.489]  I mean, this is even worse than watching the intro to Cheers.
[03:25:44.530 --> 03:25:45.930]  That's how boring this is.
[03:25:50.049 --> 03:25:51.909]  It looks exactly like it, right?
[03:25:52.809 --> 03:25:54.030]  I was totally right.
[03:25:54.129 --> 03:25:55.549]  It's Battlefront 2 Coruscant map.
[03:25:56.770 --> 03:25:57.530]  Pulled it right up.
[03:25:57.610 --> 03:25:59.190]  It goes to show you how much of a dork I am.
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:03.739]  But the fact of the matter is, these people are incredibly dangerous.
[03:26:04.219 --> 03:26:05.899]  And I can't decide who's dumber.
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:07.739]  Is it AOC or is it Joy Reid?
[03:26:07.879 --> 03:26:09.659]  We're going to play clip number 46 here in a second.
[03:26:09.920 --> 03:26:11.360]  Tell me, please, let's watch this.
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:11.940]  Which one?
[03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:13.139]  I want to know in the replies.
[03:26:13.459 --> 03:26:15.059]  I'll go back through and read them on this stream.
[03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:20.219]  Which one is dumber, AOC or Joy Reid, based on this clip specifically, 46?
[03:26:21.139 --> 03:26:26.020]  And we haven't even gotten to Tulsi Gabbard potentially having access to national security information.
[03:26:26.020 --> 03:26:28.299]  And Russia loves it, loves her.
[03:26:28.459 --> 03:26:37.020]  And I actually think, almost more than Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard's appointment is devastating.
[03:26:37.540 --> 03:26:37.940]  She's pregnant.
[03:26:38.360 --> 03:26:46.280]  And Tulsi Gabbard's nomination, as much as she says that she's an anti-war person, she's not.
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:51.620]  She supports Very pro-war individuals.
[03:26:52.020 --> 03:26:52.680]  Including in Syria.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:27:01.260]  And let's be very clear, a Tulsi Gabbard nomination is a pro-war nomination globally, point blank period.
[03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:04.799]  As is Donald Trump as President of the United States.
[03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:15.299]  I mean, I'm never gonna forget the fact that for at least a year, if not several years, Joy Reid literally had the same exact haircut as Donald Trump.
[03:27:16.079 --> 03:27:18.780]  And there's a clip somewhere out there of her getting called out on it.
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:22.739]  A week later, she buzzed her hair and she's calling us neo-Nazi.
[03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:25.200]  She's the one shaving her head as soon as she gets called Donald Trump.
[03:27:27.579 --> 03:27:33.979]  But the audacity of these people and how stupid they are saying that Tulsi Gabbard of all people is pro-war police.
[03:27:35.500 --> 03:27:38.860]  And they criticize the fact that a Fox News host was hired.
[03:27:38.979 --> 03:27:40.920]  They didn't hire him because he was a Fox News host.
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:47.000]  They hired him because of his military experience, his understanding of these operations and how terrible war is.
[03:27:47.139 --> 03:27:52.000]  The only people who really understand how terrible war is are the people who have fought in wars.
[03:27:54.250 --> 03:27:56.629]  But we've got story after story of leftists calling for violence.
[03:27:56.770 --> 03:28:01.190]  I showed you how everyone's saying that Tulsi Gabbard's a Russian asset for no reason whatsoever.
[03:28:01.370 --> 03:28:10.270]  I showed you how destiny is calling for the total removal of political dissidents from all social media platforms with rhetoric akin to that of Hitler pre-1933.
[03:28:11.770 --> 03:28:16.510]  Where it's not explicit, but you kind of get the gist that maybe he just wants all these people to die.
[03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:19.829]  You're getting that from Destiny when he talks about the right.
[03:28:19.989 --> 03:28:27.670]  And now we have this Connecticut teacher in clip number four forced out of his role as a teacher because of some of his remarks.
[03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:28.250]  Let's watch four.
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:38.739]  If you voted for Trump, literally please delete me, block me, get rid of everything of me or step to me so that I know what's up and then I can handle you how I see fit.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:43.540]  Just because you won doesn't mean we don't remember who the blank you voted for.
[03:28:43.879 --> 03:28:45.100]  You're not in the clear.
[03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:50.420]  Please, please don't test your gangster on me because you will end on a stretcher gone forever.
[03:28:50.559 --> 03:28:51.340]  What does that mean exactly?
[03:28:51.659 --> 03:28:52.719]  It sounds like a threat.
[03:28:52.909 --> 03:28:58.950]  It sounds very extreme and again, I was in a moment of high emotions and I shouldn't have ever posted the video.
[03:28:59.549 --> 03:29:14.399]  But what I really, the message I was trying to get across and it came off very wrong, was if this is going to give people the almost Permission in their minds to enact violence against women or anybody.
[03:29:14.959 --> 03:29:19.940]  I wanted to basically just say I'm not going to go down without a fight.
[03:29:20.079 --> 03:29:22.819]  I mean, it's my life's dream to be a teacher.
[03:29:24.440 --> 03:29:28.260]  I consider those kids my kids because I don't have any of my own.
[03:29:28.960 --> 03:29:30.059]  We already knew that.
[03:29:30.059 --> 03:29:34.399]  And they filled that for me, and it's so fulfilling, it's so rewarding.
[03:29:35.459 --> 03:29:46.239]  And I know that what people see right now, I don't look like that person, but I truly would do anything to help any child and any family in need.
[03:29:46.459 --> 03:29:51.479]  Just because you won doesn't mean we don't remember who the you voted for.
[03:29:51.739 --> 03:29:52.819]  You're not in the clear.
[03:29:53.319 --> 03:30:03.209]  And just please, Please don't test your gangster on me because you will end on a stretcher.
[03:30:03.270 --> 03:30:04.729]  I know exactly what kind of teacher she is.
[03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:06.750]  I had teachers like that when I was in high school.
[03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:11.170]  And every time they walked down the hall, you could hear in your mind, Hall of the Mountain King.
[03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:15.290]  Bum, bum, [...] bum.
[03:30:15.409 --> 03:30:16.209]  Where's your hall path?
[03:30:16.450 --> 03:30:18.790]  Bum, bum, [...] bum.
[03:30:19.370 --> 03:30:21.629]  She is the detention nightmare.
[03:30:21.629 --> 03:30:23.229]  The teacher you never want to run into.
[03:30:23.290 --> 03:30:24.170]  The teacher you never want to see.
[03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.489]  The teacher you never want to see.
[03:30:24.659 --> 03:30:28.979]  She just loves every child so much, but she wants to kill your parents if they voted for Donald Trump.
[03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:30.979]  These people want us dead.
[03:30:31.239 --> 03:30:34.420]  They want us shut down, silenced, literally in camps.
[03:30:34.559 --> 03:30:35.600]  They're bragging about the camps.
[03:30:35.739 --> 03:30:39.719]  We've got clip after clip after clip of the Hillary Clintons and others saying send kids to camps.
[03:30:39.879 --> 03:30:40.899]  We need camps for adults.
[03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:42.659]  We need people in the audience to run these camps.
[03:30:42.799 --> 03:30:44.000]  We need to take their children.
[03:30:44.159 --> 03:30:45.239]  We've got hidden footage of that.
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:46.520]  We've showed it countless times.
[03:30:46.940 --> 03:31:01.180]  These people want to kidnap our children, allow our borders to be invaded, and send all the adults who are political dissidents into prison or We're good to go.
[03:31:01.379 --> 03:31:09.260]  We're good to go.
[03:31:11.749 --> 03:31:17.809]  Leftist friends who all graduated from the same Department of Education curriculum at some university that no one's heard of.
[03:31:17.889 --> 03:31:20.069]  And they say their life passion is just to help children.
[03:31:20.149 --> 03:31:21.870]  I love children so much I never had any.
[03:31:21.989 --> 03:31:22.510]  Come on!
[03:31:22.989 --> 03:31:25.270]  You just wanted to go somewhere where you had some authority.
[03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:27.790]  You're a teacher because you want to rule over people.
[03:31:27.930 --> 03:31:28.989]  You want to control people.
[03:31:29.090 --> 03:31:30.069]  You want to brainwash people.
[03:31:30.149 --> 03:31:30.809]  And you didn't have any children.
[03:31:30.850 --> 03:31:33.950]  I don't know if it's because you're barren or because no man wanted to be with you.
[03:31:34.069 --> 03:31:38.170]  But the reason you didn't have any children is because God just didn't have it in plan for you.
[03:31:38.209 --> 03:31:38.629]  I'm sorry.
[03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:41.379]  God just didn't have it in plan for you.
[03:31:41.440 --> 03:31:47.459]  Now we've got Psaki coming out in clip number 22 talking about the disinformation around the Kamala defeat.
[03:31:47.600 --> 03:31:55.159]  So now they're trying to undermine the integrity of this election in the same way that we supposedly undermine the integrity of the last election with our rhetoric.
[03:31:55.340 --> 03:31:55.659]  Let's watch.
[03:31:57.429 --> 03:32:02.489]  And this is where I feel like I need to do more studying and understanding is the disinformation space.
[03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:21.610]  I do think that unquestionably to me, you know, one of the things that's changed even since I got involved in politics is just the rise of the percentage of people who get their information off of platforms that have no fact-checking mechanism and no accountability for having disinformation spread,
[03:32:21.770 --> 03:32:22.030]  right?
[03:32:22.030 --> 03:32:22.090]  Right.
[03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:30.510]  And as you know well, and I mean, when I got started in democratic politics, you know, most of it was like local TV ads.
[03:32:30.670 --> 03:32:31.350]  That was what it was about.
[03:32:31.489 --> 03:32:33.389]  Obviously, national TV, local print.
[03:32:34.409 --> 03:32:44.389]  Local TV is held to a higher standard of accountability than social media platforms in terms of having accurate information on their platforms.
[03:32:44.629 --> 03:32:44.930]  What?
[03:32:44.959 --> 03:32:45.700]  That is crazy.
[03:32:46.360 --> 03:32:47.799]  And so it is...
[03:32:47.799 --> 03:32:48.360]  That is crazy.
[03:32:48.459 --> 03:32:49.420]  How does it change?
[03:32:50.780 --> 03:32:52.239]  How are people held to account?
[03:32:52.440 --> 03:32:53.399]  Laws have to change.
[03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:57.920]  I don't even know the total answer to it, but that seems to me to be a core issue.
[03:32:58.079 --> 03:33:12.299]  The other issue, I think, that is a real one is, I don't think Joe Rogan deserves, like, 100% credit of Donald Trump being elected, but it was a misunderstanding of kind of also the...
[03:33:22.209 --> 03:33:25.770]  Not in those numbers, anyway.
[03:33:35.719 --> 03:33:44.600]  Does she not realize that X actually has the absolute, unprecedented, best fact-checking mechanism in community notes that's ever been created?
[03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:47.020]  It's done by the audience.
[03:33:47.079 --> 03:33:58.139]  The algorithm is set up in such a way that things get fact-checked as true or false only based on people who traditionally disagree agreeing on the fact-checking nature of that specific post.
[03:33:58.239 --> 03:34:02.120]  And it happens within minutes of posts going viral.
[03:34:02.889 --> 03:34:06.829]  It's getting even faster and faster by the day for smaller reach posts as well.
[03:34:06.969 --> 03:34:21.979]  It's by far the number one, the best fact-checking mechanism that has ever been created on the internet, and it's on X. But we've got clips like number 14 here, where Brazil's first lady, Da Silva, says F you to Elon Musk during the G20 summit.
[03:34:22.100 --> 03:34:32.120]  We know what he's been through in Brazil, but everyone's talking about how important fact checking is and important democracy is, but they're undermining democracy and they're throwing X under the boat when it's the best at fact checking.
[03:34:32.239 --> 03:34:35.559]  The fact of the matter is they hate fact checking because they're always lying.
[03:34:35.739 --> 03:34:36.159]  Let's watch.
[03:34:36.860 --> 03:34:41.079]  This matter is under...
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:45.979]  I think it's Elon Musk.
[03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:48.700]  She's trying to be cute.
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:50.239]  I'm not afraid of you, by the way, she says.
[03:34:53.659 --> 03:34:59.139]  She says F you Elon Musk to a moderately sized group in Brazil.
[03:35:01.959 --> 03:35:03.719]  Absolutely disgusting stuff.
[03:35:04.459 --> 03:35:05.299]  And I understand.
[03:35:05.459 --> 03:35:06.520]  You can have your own opinions.
[03:35:06.520 --> 03:35:09.120]  You can say F you to these social media leaders.
[03:35:09.139 --> 03:35:11.620]  You can have sentiments against Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:35:11.659 --> 03:35:12.920]  I have problems with Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:35:12.979 --> 03:35:14.360]  I have problems with the leaders of Google.
[03:35:14.559 --> 03:35:16.120]  I have problems with the leaders of Apple even.
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:17.379]  And the Bill Gateses.
[03:35:17.479 --> 03:35:19.100]  We criticize people all the time.
[03:35:19.780 --> 03:35:30.100]  But the fact of the matter is the reason they hate Elon Musk is because he has A, protected freedom of speech, and then B, done the best fact-checking ever.
[03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:38.610]  And they act like he's throwing millions upon millions of dollars through his super PACs and things like that to ensure that Donald Trump is elected.
[03:35:38.770 --> 03:35:46.010]  This is the example of the billionaire class just throwing an election when we know that the vast majority of billionaires have been on the side of the leftists.
[03:35:46.129 --> 03:35:50.350]  We know that the vast majority of major money comes from leftists for leftists.
[03:35:52.389 --> 03:36:04.930]  And we know that Kamala Harris' campaign, as they bragged, had over a billion dollars, an unprecedented amount of money, because, first of all, they immediately inherited $400 million, at least, when they established this coup successfully.
[03:36:04.930 --> 03:36:07.950]  They manifested over Joe Biden, so they got all that money.
[03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:10.069]  Then they raised some astronomical sum of money.
[03:36:10.350 --> 03:36:11.850]  Now they're $20 million in debt.
[03:36:12.010 --> 03:36:19.809]  I think Trump spent like a third of the money that the leftists spent on this campaign and still won, because, like the Beatles said, you can't buy me love.
[03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:23.969]  I mean, if money was all that it took to win an election, then Bloomberg would be president.
[03:36:24.190 --> 03:36:25.750]  Bloomberg would have been president the last time.
[03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:28.190]  He would have won the primary, but nobody liked that little weasel.
[03:36:29.889 --> 03:36:33.969]  There's a squirrel that should have been raided by SWAT. Adam Schiff literally looks like a squirrel as well.
[03:36:34.190 --> 03:36:36.729]  He should have been raided by SWAT, but instead they're coming after Peanut.
[03:36:37.090 --> 03:36:38.190]  They're coming after you.
[03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:42.690]  They're trying to silence everyone because everything they say is a lie.
[03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:45.549]  Everything they accuse us of, they themselves are doing.
[03:36:46.540 --> 03:36:49.899]  And whenever they say they love this country or the Constitution, they say it because they hate it.
[03:36:49.979 --> 03:36:52.760]  Whenever they say they love freedom of speech, they say it because they hate it.
[03:36:53.040 --> 03:36:56.319]  Whenever they say they love safety, they say it because they hate it.
[03:36:56.379 --> 03:37:00.940]  And whenever they say I'm a gun owner, they say it because they know that you know that they want to take your guns.
[03:37:02.040 --> 03:37:03.280]  That's the fact of the matter here.
[03:37:06.340 --> 03:37:08.459]  And they hate the fact that the RFKs are coming in.
[03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:19.389]  I'm going to show clip number 25 on why they fear RFK Jr., They hate the fact that outsiders are coming into the little club because you're not a member here.
[03:37:19.530 --> 03:37:22.350]  Just like George Carlin said, it's all a club and you're not in it.
[03:37:22.569 --> 03:37:30.709]  They hate these outsiders coming into the club and changing the rules and getting on the board of directors of this political class and just dismantling it piece by piece.
[03:37:30.809 --> 03:37:31.629]  This is clip number 25.
[03:37:32.479 --> 03:37:35.899]  So, you know, there's a number of things that happened in 1989.
[03:37:36.420 --> 03:37:40.620]  But those diseases, all these autoimmune diseases suddenly appeared.
[03:37:40.719 --> 03:37:42.600]  I never knew anybody with juvenile diabetes.
[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:49.260]  When I was a kid, a typical pediatrician would see one case of juvenile diabetes in his career.
[03:37:50.440 --> 03:37:55.100]  Today, one out of every three kids who walks through his office door has something happen.
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:57.100]  Why isn't anybody talking about this?
[03:37:57.219 --> 03:38:04.680]  Rheumatoid arthritis suddenly exploded, lupus, all these autoimmune diseases, Crohn's disease, these exotic diseases.
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:08.139]  Nobody ever heard of when I was a kid.
[03:38:08.799 --> 03:38:10.100]  Now they're everywhere.
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:20.239]  And so you have allergic diseases, you have neurological disease and autoimmune diseases, and obesity suddenly appear around 1989.
[03:38:20.899 --> 03:38:25.579]  And so there's a number of things that could be blamed for it.
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:29.239]  Well, the CDC thought it may be the vaccine schedule.
[03:38:29.420 --> 03:38:29.959]  Let's check.
[03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:35.909]  So they looked at one vaccine, which is the hepatitis B vaccine.
[03:38:37.459 --> 03:38:44.020]  They looked at kids who had gotten it in the first 30 days, and then they looked at kids who had not gotten it in 30 days.
[03:38:44.059 --> 03:38:47.440]  In other words, kids who got it later or didn't get it at all.
[03:38:47.639 --> 03:38:49.219]  And they compared these two groups.
[03:38:50.059 --> 03:39:05.059]  And among the kids who got it in the first 30 days, there was a, I think it was a 10,000% increased risk.
[03:39:08.129 --> 03:39:13.930]  For a later subsequent autism diagnosis, if you got in the first 30 days.
[03:39:14.750 --> 03:39:15.190]  Wow.
[03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:18.010]  So they immediately knew what was causing it.
[03:39:18.270 --> 03:39:19.090]  Oh, I know it was.
[03:39:19.090 --> 03:39:25.030]  It was 11.35, so it's an 1135% increased risk.
[03:39:28.929 --> 03:39:31.370]  And so they knew immediately.
[03:39:31.809 --> 03:39:34.649]  It's called a relative risk of 11.35.
[03:39:34.930 --> 03:39:38.690]  If you have a relative risk of 2, causation is presumed.
[03:39:38.850 --> 03:39:40.229]  This was 11.35.
[03:39:41.370 --> 03:39:49.010]  The link between smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years and getting lung cancer is a relative risk of 10.
[03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:51.090]  This was 11.35.
[03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:53.270]  They knew what it was.
[03:39:53.450 --> 03:39:53.969]  And then...
[03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:58.340]  They had an emergency meeting that they called.
[03:39:58.540 --> 03:40:04.000]  They didn't want to do it on CDC campus because they thought it would be susceptible to freedom of information requests.
[03:40:05.040 --> 03:40:20.659]  So they did it in this remote retreat center called Simpsonwood, which is a Methodist retreat center on the wooded banks of the Chattahoochee River in a remote part of Georgia.
[03:40:22.350 --> 03:40:37.409]  And they had all of the big pangerums from the vaccine industry, from the pharmaceutical industry, from the universities who are the ones who test the vaccines, from NIH, CDC, FDA, the World Health Organization, the European Medical Agency,
[03:40:37.450 --> 03:40:41.110]  and they all got together for two days to talk about this study.
[03:40:41.930 --> 03:40:49.569]  The first day, somebody made a transcript of it, and that transcript was given to me.
[03:40:51.260 --> 03:40:53.399]  And I publish excerpts from it.
[03:40:53.479 --> 03:41:01.920]  But the first day, they're all talking about, oh my God, you know, the lawyers are going to come after us.
[03:41:02.139 --> 03:41:03.459]  Nobody can deny this.
[03:41:03.559 --> 03:41:04.639]  This is bulletproof.
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:06.799]  You know, there's no way to argue with this.
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:08.040]  This is real science.
[03:41:08.260 --> 03:41:09.899]  We can't, you know, what are we going to do?
[03:41:10.720 --> 03:41:15.000]  The second day, they spent talking about how to hide it from the American public.
[03:41:15.819 --> 03:41:18.579]  And I published these things.
[03:41:19.420 --> 03:41:22.540]  Then I took a lot of heat at that point.
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:33.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not win a war on November 5th of 2024.
[03:41:34.700 --> 03:41:36.159]  We started a war.
[03:41:36.979 --> 03:41:44.180]  This is just the beginning of the political conflict of our lives, of the information conflict of our lives.
[03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:51.139]  All of the assaults are on full blast on our republic and on Infowars and on Alex Jones and this crew.
[03:41:52.059 --> 03:41:54.100]  Now, there are several ways that you can support us.
[03:41:54.159 --> 03:41:56.100]  We always encourage people to pray for us.
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:42:02.940]  We always encourage people to go to band.video or to follow us on X, download the clips, share the clips, make viral versions of our broadcasts.
[03:42:03.020 --> 03:42:04.000]  Those are all great.
[03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:18.989]  But the number one best way that you can ensure that Alex Jones will always be on the air for another 30 years is by going to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP and signing up as a VIP member.
[03:42:20.629 --> 03:42:23.389]  Now, when you sign up as a VIP member, you spend $30.
[03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:25.569]  You can cancel any time that you want.
[03:42:25.709 --> 03:42:27.309]  You get $40 in store credit.
[03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:29.069]  So it's not even really an expense.
[03:42:29.209 --> 03:42:30.569]  It's practically an investment.
[03:42:30.629 --> 03:42:34.129]  If you're gonna buy one shirt a month for $35, it's a no-brainer that you do it.
[03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:42.129]  Plus, you get the lost broadcasts from 2001 to 2008, over 40,000 segments of broadcasts with searchable transcripts.
[03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:47.709]  If you download them, you can search them by keyword or phrase to find the dates and times that Alex Jones made any claims or any predictions.
[03:42:48.960 --> 03:42:54.120]  And tons of other benefits like increased entries for our contests or giveaways.
[03:42:54.239 --> 03:42:56.379]  Right now there's an amazing truck up for giveaway.
[03:42:57.079 --> 03:42:58.440]  That's the second installment.
[03:42:58.620 --> 03:43:01.180]  We're going to announce the winner for the first truck this week.
[03:43:01.299 --> 03:43:03.440]  Later this week we've identified and reached out to that person.
[03:43:03.579 --> 03:43:06.120]  We're going to have them in studio with the boys from Bigly.
[03:43:07.610 --> 03:43:15.750]  But you're not just getting amazing supplements, shirts, hats, winning amazing trucks, getting amazing content, lost broadcasts which can't be found anywhere else.
[03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:22.969]  They've always been free to air but they were wiped from the internet when we were purged from iTunes back when it was called iTunes years ago.
[03:43:23.780 --> 03:43:32.280]  So for the first time you can get all those lost broadcasts, you're not getting just amazing posters, you're actually fighting for freedom of speech and you're fighting for humanity too.
[03:43:32.739 --> 03:43:46.389]  Because what's going to happen over the course of the next four years is an unprecedented assault on this republic, on our freedoms, On the MAGA movement within the Republican Party because it's not just the Democrats that want to bring down MAGA Republicans.
[03:43:46.450 --> 03:43:47.629]  It's also the neocons.
[03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:57.110]  It's also the Warhawks, the military industrial complex, the private political press, the political industrial complex that extends beyond military operations.
[03:43:57.290 --> 03:44:06.190]  They literally want World War III because it sows so much confusion and disorder and desperation that it's the best way to conglomerate all political power.
[03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:22.000]  I firmly believe that the likes of the United Nations, NATO, and the World Economic Forum all are conspiring, especially with the international banking cartels.
[03:44:23.239 --> 03:44:29.180]  To make us totally dependent on their new digital currency, on their new military operations.
[03:44:29.219 --> 03:44:31.479]  So that when we need food, we have to go to them.
[03:44:31.620 --> 03:44:33.340]  When we need money, we have to get permission.
[03:44:33.500 --> 03:44:35.920]  When we wanna spend our own money, we have to get approved.
[03:44:36.100 --> 03:44:38.020]  They are trying to take over the world.
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:39.680]  So we have not won the war.
[03:44:39.780 --> 03:44:41.260]  We have started the war.
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:42.940]  We have declared independence.
[03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:45.520]  We have declared war against the New World Order.
[03:44:45.600 --> 03:44:48.559]  And it has just begun as of the last couple of weeks.
[03:44:49.209 --> 03:44:56.250]  So please go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP because no matter what happens to Infowars, this store will remain up.
[03:44:56.370 --> 03:45:08.750]  It will fund the next operation, the gummies, the supplements, the shirts, and the freedom all for sale at thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. Please become a VIP for Alex, for this network.
[03:45:09.409 --> 03:45:12.590]  For this crew, and be the reason Alex will always be on the air.
[03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:28.090]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[03:45:28.350 --> 03:45:33.670]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[03:45:34.489 --> 03:45:37.549]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[03:45:38.049 --> 03:45:41.909]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[03:45:42.030 --> 03:45:42.549]  Who knows?
[03:45:43.090 --> 03:45:45.530]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[03:45:45.829 --> 03:46:00.190]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved, filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[03:46:00.700 --> 03:46:04.600]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:17.360]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[03:46:17.860 --> 03:46:19.020]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[03:46:19.200 --> 03:46:33.760]  And if you remember, when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at theauctionstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[03:46:34.190 --> 03:46:37.969]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[03:46:38.069 --> 03:46:39.350]  But that's going to get announced.
[03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:41.530]  The winner here in just a few days.
[03:46:41.709 --> 03:46:45.729]  And regardless of whether Infowars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[03:46:45.809 --> 03:46:47.370]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[03:46:47.530 --> 03:46:49.209]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[03:46:49.450 --> 03:46:50.290]  So now...
[03:46:50.700 --> 03:46:58.399]  We were going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:04.299]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:47:04.479 --> 03:47:05.760]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[03:47:05.920 --> 03:47:06.879]  It's a beautiful truck.
[03:47:07.450 --> 03:47:12.809]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:15.770]  And there's so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.

[03:48:59.170 --> 03:49:01.049]  It's so exciting to see the big win with Trump.
[03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:06.690]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[03:49:06.930 --> 03:49:07.850]  God bless you all.
