[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.729]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.210]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWar and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.570]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.750]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.790]  The quickening is here.
[00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.969]  As I promised you, things are just going to get more intense from here on out.
[00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.969]  We are six days, 12 hours, 58 minutes, 40 seconds, the most important election in world history.
[00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.870]  It is October 29th, 2024.
[00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.950]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I want to thank you all for tuning in to this transmission today.
[00:01:42.170 --> 00:02:05.549]  Now, The news is so massive, so over-the-top important that I just want everyone to let this sink in.
[00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.530]  The historic moment that we are in.
[00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.210]  The entire former globalist political system is collapsing in on itself.
[00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.590]  They are completely desperate.
[00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:41.569]  As predicted, I now have a stack of mainstream news, corporate news, with Homeland Security saying that Trump supporters are the main terror threat and they believe we're going to launch terror attacks during the election.
[00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.530]  That's already begun.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.680]  Now, I've been saying over and over again that that is the last piece of the puzzle.
[00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.800]  And that when they did that, you knew it was coming.
[00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.819]  That's how they want to try to outlaw us, is saying we're Hitler and we're Nazis and we're violent.
[00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.840]  We're going to do all these things.
[00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.099]  And now they've done it.
[00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:11.479]  They're also saying anyone questioning the election is a terrorist in the reports they're putting out.
[00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:30.340]  While they publicly let illegal aliens on the ballot and are having federal judges rule that illegal aliens can vote and that they can count ballots with no postmarks after the election, meaning they can create all the fake ballots they need to to try to overcome Trump victories in key battlegrounds.
[00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.699]  Stephen Crowder's investigative unit It's really starting to rival in a good way.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.439]  We're all on the same team, Team Humanity.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:48.699]  The work of James O'Keefe, they got undercover footage of a Democrat operative admitting how they stole it.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.340]  Steven Crowder's coming up, joining us.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.180]  It's just absolutely wild.
[00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.870]  And then on top of that, I told you Tim Walz was a communist Chinese agent.
[00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:13.870]  And when you're officially a communist Chinese agent, they always put a sex operative with the men, like Feng Feng with Swallowswell.
[00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.750]  It's all on record.
[00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.259]  And it's all coming up today.
[00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.360]  The globalists are in free fall.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.800]  This is historic.
[00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.060]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.079]  Everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:52.639]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.519]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, October 29th, 2024 transmission.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.899]  We are six days.
[00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.930]  Out from the official election day, November 5th.
[00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.110]  In six days, we will be in the main election day.
[00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:27.029]  But as you know, early voting and mail-in has begun weeks and weeks ago, and Unlike four years ago, where the Democrats had illegals voting and were getting caught flooding the zone with fake voters and dead people and the rest of it,
[00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.610]  it was not really a big topic until they were in the act of stealing it after November 5th.
[00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.670]  It is now everywhere.
[00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.910]  It is not even denied.
[00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:51.079]  Yeah, we're letting illegal aliens vote in basically every state, including red states, Texas, The Supreme Court of Nevada just ruled that they don't need postmarks on ballots.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.680]  They don't even have to be shown they were through the Postal Service, which is the law, and that they can count them three days after, so whatever amount they need, they can provide.
[00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:12.920]  It's confirmed in Pennsylvania that they're arresting Republican Party officials that go to the polling places where they're not letting conservatives vote and just telling them the machines are broken day after day.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.279]  And then they arrest him.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.600]  They warn people.
[00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.500]  And it's all confirmed.
[00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:28.019]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I have more than 30 mainstream news reports of this happening, and it gets even worse.
[00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.600]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:47.959]  We have the left running around, firebombing in Washington and in Oregon, The drop boxes, it is just over the top.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.899]  And they may be getting ready to false flag and claim conservatives did that.
[00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:52.839]  That's what I would do if I was them.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.360]  But let me give you the big announcement right now.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.259]  And there's so much to hit.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.420]  I have been up here like a broken record.
[00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:21.199]  With all the pre-programming and all the preparation I saw and all the claims that Trump's going to use the military and kill everybody and there's going to be violence and he's going to kill black people and Hispanics with no evidence and he's a Hitler because the Nazis had a rally at Madison Square Garden 85 years ago and all the rest of it.
[00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:46.339]  And I've hammered that and I've hammered that and I've hammered that and I said very close to election day if they start publicly putting out memos That Republicans are the main terror threat and that Trump supporters are going to stage attacks during a contested election that you know they're going to go with that card.
[00:07:48.839 --> 00:08:06.160]  Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies in the Justice Department yesterday, and I have the articles right here, put out public alerts that they believe there's going to be terror attacks on and after the election or during the speeder election And that the main threat is Trump supporters.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.879]  So it's not hard to call this when they're pre-programming it everywhere.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:29.860]  But you know when they go to that last piece that just like the feds got caught planting pipe bombs on January 6th and provocateur in the crowd, they are absolutely Initiating this move.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.779]  Now, will they pull back at the last minute?
[00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:32.559]  I don't know.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.519]  I don't think so.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:49.320]  And man, I really don't want to be here tomorrow or next week or two weeks from now and a truck bomb blows up a black college or a black church or a polling place or a liberal anti-Trump demonstration saying Trump won gets machine gunned out of a parking garage from above.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.019]  Or a federal building gets blown up by a truck bomb.
[00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.230]  But that's the last piece now.
[00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:04.289]  So the next to last piece in the jigsaw puzzle just fell in.
[00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.149]  There's one piece left.
[00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.529]  You can see the picture.
[00:09:06.909 --> 00:09:08.309]  There's one little piece left.
[00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:08.750]  Bloop!
[00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:10.029]  That's it.
[00:09:10.429 --> 00:09:11.309]  One piece left.
[00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.570]  And it's just stunning that they're actually doing this, despite the fact that a lot of people are onto them.
[00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:25.029]  You have a desperate political system that's stolen tens of trillions of dollars out of these agencies, the Pentagon, you name it.
[00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.330]  They know there's an awakening.
[00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.649]  They know they've committed all these crimes.
[00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.690]  They know they rolled out the Wuhan shot and the Wuhan virus and all of it.
[00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:35.070]  They know there's a giant global political realignment.
[00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:42.049]  And they've said they want pure totalitarianism as the answer to staying in power.
[00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.950]  So it's very simple.
[00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:47.029]  There's been a long-term bureaucratic corporate coup over our institutions and systems.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.759]  They've had all these puppet presidents for at least 40 years other than Trump.
[00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:59.740]  There's a populist uprising, peacefully, and so they're going to stage attacks or events or crises and blame it on us.
[00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:08.360]  And the feds are also saying, as I said they would do a year ago, imminent cyber attack from the Russians working with Trump supporters.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.019]  The Trump supporters are going to destabilize the election.
[00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:14.360]  But who's actually destabilizing the election?
[00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:24.720]  And who's saying in policy reports, John Podesta, Jamie Raskin, Carville, all of them, we need an armed uprising against Trump.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.039]  We will not certify him if we think it looks like he won.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.000]  We're going to be in civil war conditions.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.120]  I mean, they're all over the place.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.399]  Kamala Harris, Trump is coming with the military to kill black men.
[00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:38.519]  Biden, Trump is coming to target black men.
[00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:41.659]  There were more clips yesterday.
[00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:42.679]  I didn't even get to them.
[00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:54.519]  Whoopi Goldberg says, got the clip right here, on yesterday's view, looking like a total lunatic, Trump is going to ban interracial marriage?
[00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:55.980]  He never even talked about that.
[00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:04.519]  I mean, it is just, that's just as crazy, and it's hard to be just as crazy, because it's the limit of crazy.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:13.919]  I'm sure they'll come up with something even crazier, but it's the limit I've seen, that Trump is Hitler because the Nazis 85 years ago had a rally in Madison Square Garden, and now he had one.
[00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.580]  That's the same as Hitler drank water.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.259]  Trump drinks water.
[00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:19.919]  Trump is Hitler.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.820]  So we've got that.
[00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:41.850]  Meanwhile, they have all these fashion consultants for Biden and Harris, and Biden's had those nighttime rallies with troops behind him, with red light behind him, raising his fists and screaming like Hitler, and then Kamala Harris shows up at her rally yesterday in a literal,
[00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.450]  no one's ever worn this since Hitler, an actual Hitler outfit.
[00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:50.549]  I think it's even Hugo Boss that originally put it out.
[00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:52.870]  They're still around.
[00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.710]  I mean, that's on purpose.
[00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:57.570]  These people are nuts.
[00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:05.450]  It's like Hillary famously wearing the same dresses, literally the same type dresses that Mao Zedong's wife would wear.
[00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.269]  You got all that.
[00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:12.330]  So everything the globalists do turns to pure crap.
[00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:14.289]  Everyone's turning against them.
[00:12:15.289 --> 00:12:30.419]  And they, with no evidence for saying Trump's going to kill brown people, And then now the FBI and the CIA and Homeland Security are saying, oh, there's a big threat of terror on election day and after.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.000]  And what did I see two plus weeks ago on 60 Minutes with these former generals warning of Trump?
[00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:45.899]  They said, oh, states are going to not decide the election for a few days and Trump supporters are going to attack.
[00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:48.480]  No evidence.
[00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:53.299]  So they're telling you the whole story, lining it all up.
[00:12:57.539 --> 00:13:14.779]  It'd be like if you had a roommate in a condo you're renting in college, and you notice your roommate getting all his stuff out one day, and you see the paperwork laying on the coffee table that he just bought a bunch of fire insurance for the condo,
[00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.610]  Let's say you're renting it from him.
[00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.210]  I'm renting a room.
[00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:19.850]  He owns it.
[00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.710]  And then the next night, you see him cooking food with grease on the stove.
[00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.710]  He just leaves, and it bursts into flames.
[00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:36.730]  You're going to kind of go, did Bob or Will or David or whatever his name is, did he burn this down?
[00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.169]  I mean, this is even more obvious.
[00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.110]  My job is not hard.
[00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:49.629]  The globalists say that Trump supporters are going to murder everybody imminently and are going to kill all the brown people.
[00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.730]  And I'm just sitting here looking at my watch going, okay, when do they start false flagging the minorities?
[00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.450]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is ridiculous.
[00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:14.250]  And then you've got unprecedented fraud so crazy that So open that I'll go through in a moment that I can't even believe it's this bracelet.
[00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:22.809]  I mean, they just don't give a damn because they want to piss us off and they want to get a fight going because they know they've lost politically.
[00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:26.289]  But populists are really smart at this point.
[00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.490]  We know we're winning culturally.
[00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.629]  And so we're not going to get violent.
[00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:33.769]  So they'll provide the violence, but it gets worse.
[00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:48.769]  I've said decades ago, because it was in their own documents, UN, Club of Rome, WEF, Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep, Event 201, Crimson Contagion, SPARS 2025-2028.
[00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:51.110]  Just a few examples.
[00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.350]  The BioShield program, 2006, that's back in the news.
[00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:07.149]  That they would use the threat of a virus to lock down society and roll out regional and then global ID cards for a new central bank digital currency.
[00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.149]  They were saying this 20 plus years ago.
[00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.690]  Now it's here.
[00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.889]  But it needs the rollout.
[00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:19.669]  And so, the question is asked at InfoWars, and it's a good headline, but I'll answer it.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.220]  Our vaccine passport's just around the corner.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.899]  U.S., Canada, Mexico launch pandemic preparedness initiative.
[00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:31.039]  Well, what's in the 2006 Banff Canada documents that are in my film Endgame?
[00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.080]  The Judicial Watch suit and got it.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:41.659]  Said then, we will use sometime in the next few decades, maybe sooner, a viral outbreak, probably from China.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.379]  It's always the same script.
[00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:52.470]  To bring in A North American ID tied to a vaccine passport will have people stand six feet apart.
[00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.429]  Will everybody wear a mask so they believe it's real.
[00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.190]  This is in public documents I've shown you.
[00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.950]  I'll show them to you again today.
[00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.210]  FEMA created tens of billions of these packages in 2006.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.139]  Rodney Howard Brown actually still had one.
[00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.100]  I just remember him in the news articles about it.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.000]  He did a show a few years ago about it.
[00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:15.179]  You can go find that.
[00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:19.899]  With the FEMA packet about the six feet apart, the mask, and stay in your house and don't go.
[00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:22.100]  That was all prepared then.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.200]  And so, yeah, it's here.
[00:16:24.919 --> 00:16:32.419]  So they didn't get the UN treaty passed, but they're still just implementing it, and Europe's implementing it, and the UN is over it, and Bill Gates has standardized it all.
[00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:50.809]  For the Global Cashless Society that is a regional EU, North American, African Union, Asian Union, passports, vaccine passports, where it's a unified app, and then it's under the central bank currency,
[00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:55.450]  the social credit score, and the gateway into it, just like Australia admitted in the last four years.
[00:16:56.779 --> 00:17:04.019]  And in the EU is the vaccine passport that's really your new global ID. Big article on Infowars.com.
[00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.220]  So yeah, it's our vaccine passports coming.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.220]  They're rolling them out.
[00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:19.039]  So they've said in the next lockdown, all over the world, the UN has said it.
[00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.039]  The head of their global emergency response, Dr.
[00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:21.819]  Ryan, has said it.
[00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.059]  Hotez has said it.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.380]  Tedros has said it.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:36.180]  That they're going to use NATO and the UN to spy and surveil and censor, but also arrest people who don't go along with the next lockdown and put you in camps.
[00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:52.579]  So they build all these camps supposedly for quarantines, and even Hochul said in New York a few months ago, she said, oh yeah, if you don't go along with what we say in the next lockdown and forced injections in the law she's trying to pass to get in line with this, we will put you in a camp.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.190]  Now, Obviously, that's going to cause big shootouts.
[00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:02.890]  Because even if 1% of people don't go along with this, that's millions of people that are going to fight.
[00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.950]  And the globalists know that.
[00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:06.630]  And they're going to try to start that fight.
[00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.809]  So I'm going to ask the police and the military and the FBI and the rest of you guys this.
[00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.329]  Are you smart enough to see what's going on?
[00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.930]  And I know you're training for this.
[00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.430]  It's on record.
[00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.849]  Are you ready for war with the American people?
[00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.390]  Because right after they steal this election and bring in martial law, they're going to release a new virus.
[00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.789]  And they're going to release a new freakout.
[00:18:26.569 --> 00:18:28.970]  And we're going to lose our dollar, our currency.
[00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.210]  All of us will be screwed.
[00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:31.589]  Our way of life will be over.
[00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.849]  We'll all be slaves.
[00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:41.769]  And the globalists think the public's so stupid and they think their enforcers are so stupid that we're all going to blow up our own ship we're on and sink ourselves?
[00:18:42.009 --> 00:18:45.509]  I mean, this is the stupidest crap I've ever seen.
[00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:51.950]  All so a bunch of crooks that have hijacked the country and the world and run it to the ground can stay in power.
[00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.890]  So it's all over the Washington Post.
[00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:12.589]  It's all over everything that the Pentagon and NATO and the UN is already going to run the new lockdowns and the control and the damn camps have been built everywhere all over the world.
[00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:26.789]  They're publicly trying to steal the election and saying imminent terror attacks from Trump supporters.
[00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:29.940]  Out of a clear blue sky.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.039]  And then they signed executive orders a few months ago.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.099]  Whoever's running the Biden-Harris coup.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.500]  Four civil unrest troops ready to kill American citizens.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.579]  That's martial law.
[00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:53.559]  While they run around like chickens with their heads cut off saying Trump's going to do it.
[00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:58.069]  So it's introduced in your mind and normalized, but you think it's Trump.
[00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.869]  And so when Biden said last week, we've got to arrest Trump, put him in prison, or he's going to kill us with the military.
[00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.170]  He's coming to kill the black people.
[00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.210]  Carville, he's coming to kill the black men.
[00:20:09.769 --> 00:20:10.250]  What?
[00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:13.000]  Well, I can't vote for Trump.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.799]  He's coming to kill me.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.079]  But it's bigger than just voting for Trump.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:28.099]  They want everybody divided so the trigger for the martial law takeover will be billed as civil unrest, race war, that leads to civil emergency that is martial law.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.319]  But they won't call it that.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:43.130]  So, and again, the top globalist minions, their tacticians, Raskin and Podesta have all said, We are going to create civil war conditions.
[00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:44.609]  So, they're doing it.
[00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:59.109]  And they said four years ago, in Bloomberg and AP and everywhere, John Podesta said it'll look like a red wave, but the mail-in ballots, no matter what happens, there will be enough to get rid of him, and sure as hell there were, because they produced the number they needed.
[00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:09.250]  And when they didn't produce enough in Arizona, they just kept it open forever, and then just said, well, we're just going to accept it.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.579]  So this is beyond horrifying.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.099]  Now I'm going to go to break in a few minutes, but I want to play my update last night that just covers some of these.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.680]  Then there's a whole bunch of new election fraud developments.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.920]  And then I'm going to walk through every bit of this.
[00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:26.400]  And then Stephen Crowder's joining us.
[00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:33.519]  His undercover team got Democrat Party operative at just admitting how they stole Georgia and how the strategies work.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.779]  Just smoking gun stuff.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.339]  So that's coming up.
[00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:41.259]  And then you've got all the rest of it.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.539]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.319]  Putin says, prepare for nuclear war.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.119]  There's a full nuclear alert.
[00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:54.440]  You've got Walls being caught being a communist Chinese agent.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.700]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.299]  All right, let's go ahead and go to my report from last night.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:05.559]  Total election fraud happening everywhere in your face.
[00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:06.039]  Here it is.
[00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.809]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've looked at all the angles, and on my regular weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:11.309]  to 3 p.m.
[00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.309]  Central, the real Alex Jones on X, and on X as well, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:21.829]  We've been laying out the fact that Trump is going to win in a landslide, but it doesn't mean it'll look like a landslide because there's so much fraud baked in.
[00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:36.950]  But they've only got so much fraud, so many dead people, so many illegals, so many just phantom folks like in Michigan that Aren't even real people, but they now admit 500,000 of them are there that aren't registered voters, but the state's gonna let them go ahead and vote.
[00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:42.890]  And then you've got Alabama taking a bunch of illegal aliens off the ballot a few weeks ago when the federal judge comes in and says, put them back on.
[00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:44.329]  Same thing just happened in Georgia.
[00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:48.930]  Same thing yesterday in Virginia, where there's a bipartisan state law passed over a decade ago.
[00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:50.049]  The illegal aliens can't vote.
[00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:52.269]  Well, that's already the law, but they have another law saying that.
[00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.549]  Now the feds said, hey, they stay on.
[00:22:55.289 --> 00:22:56.269]  It goes on and on.
[00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:59.210]  And then you saw Texas a month ago.
[00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.470]  The Secretary of State said we're being threatened by the feds.
[00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.930]  So non-citizens, people with non-citizen IDs can vote.
[00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.990]  You can check all this.
[00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:08.690]  It's all on record.
[00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.930]  There's a bunch of other examples.
[00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.109]  Now in Washington state, ballot boxes are getting burnt.
[00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.470]  Democrats are getting caught breaking into them in other areas.
[00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:38.089]  And in Nevada, just a few hours ago, their Supreme Court said for three days after the election, Ballots with no postmark or date on them will be counted so they can just find out how many they need when Trump wins next Tuesday and just keep stuffing and keep delivering them just magically there and then they've got what they need.
[00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:39.549]  It's the same story.
[00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.990]  So instead of trucks arriving at 3 a.m.
[00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:50.000]  in Detroit, And being brought in all for Joe Biden, now they're just, whatever they need is just put into the mailboxes with no dates on it, total fraud.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.900]  So the system is totally desperate.
[00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:55.339]  I don't think it'll be enough to steal it from Trump, but this is just insane.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.259]  But regardless, the journey is the destination.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:03.480]  Big Pharma, the New World Order, the child trafficking, the globalists trying to start World War III. It's all out in the open.
[00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:04.740]  It's the hottest issue everywhere.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.900]  All the top talk show hosts are anti-New World Order now.
[00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:09.059]  The revolution is happening right now.
[00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:10.039]  So pray for Trump.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.759]  Pray for America.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.319]  We're not going to be violent if they steal it.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.440]  We're just going to expose it.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:21.059]  They're going to try to string the election out for weeks so they can try to create some type of fight on the ground.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.640]  Democrats are saying they're not going to certify Trump if he does win.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.480]  Congressman Jamie Raskin and others.
[00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:35.380]  They want to kick it to Congress, so it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025, to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:51.400]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions, all because the nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do, a huge staff, great protection,
[00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:54.930]  simply do not want To do their job.
[00:24:55.170 --> 00:25:00.809]  And they're talking about civil war conditions and Carvel's calling for armed uprisings while they claim we're going to do that.
[00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.349]  So we're not going to get violent, we're just going to keep exposing them.
[00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.150]  And four years ago, they were denying this even after the election.
[00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:07.369]  Now it's all out in the open.
[00:25:07.509 --> 00:25:19.119]  They're having to say illegals can vote and all the rest is crap in front of everybody and now ballots In Nevada for three days after with no postmark or good so they can deliver any amount of fraud they need.
[00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:21.480]  So we are forcing the monster out in the open.
[00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:23.039]  We're forcing him to take the mask off.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.339]  We're winning the war.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.799]  If the globalists steal this battle, and I'm not getting you ready for that, I think Trump's gonna win.
[00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.349]  So decisively, too big to rig.
[00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:35.049]  But even if they do this, we are winning the war.
[00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.049]  It'll be a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.130]  They'll win this battle, but it'll even further discredit them more.
[00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:44.029]  But I grew up with Tucker Carlson last night in Madison Square Garden.
[00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:48.190]  When he said, look, she's so unpopular, there's no way anybody's gonna buy this.
[00:25:48.349 --> 00:25:51.650]  So we are at an incredible juncture right now.
[00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:56.670]  Everybody needs to be completely focused, and you need to educate everybody around you, because people are ready to wake up.
[00:25:56.769 --> 00:25:59.049]  Everything I've talked about for 30 years has been confirmed.
[00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.869]  It's all out in the open, and Infowars could be shut down in 14 days.
[00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:08.130]  It's emblematic of the climate of danger and tyranny, and how much the truth threatens the establishment.
[00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.130]  And it's not just me doing important shows.
[00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.930]  It's not just other folks like Tucker Carlson.
[00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:12.609]  It's you.
[00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:18.900]  Who decides to share these reports and get the information and share it with others because the mind is very fertile to the truth.
[00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:20.579]  The great awakening is happening now.
[00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:36.180]  And I need you to follow us on the new Alex Jones Network in case they shut down InfoWars at AJNLive for Alex Jones Network, AJNLive on X. And I need you to support our sponsors that are separate from InfoWars, thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements,

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.660]  History's happening.
[00:27:17.079 --> 00:27:18.039]  God bless and good luck.
[00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:29.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.

[00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:47.210]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:48.930]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[00:27:49.289 --> 00:27:50.450]  It's not just a detox.
[00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.730]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[00:27:54.009 --> 00:27:55.049]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.450]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.410]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.619]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.339]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.460]  They're concentrated.
[00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:08.559]  They're incredible.
[00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:14.000]  You want to get it right now at the AlexJonesStore.com for between 30 and 50% off.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.400]  50% off if you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:24.720]  I ask God to give me the strength and the words that describe the tremendous peril.
[00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.809]  That not just the United States, but the entire world is in right now.
[00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.829]  We are coming to the end of an age.
[00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:42.670]  The powerful financial interests that have stolen control of much of the planet are truly a death cult in service directly to Satan.
[00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:46.970]  That has become crystal clear to anyone that has a mind.
[00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.769]  There's been an explosive awakening to that, an epiphany.
[00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.869]  But that is not rhetorical, but that is factual.
[00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:00.420]  The end of their bubble is here.
[00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:02.759]  They plan to go to their new cash flow society.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.579]  It's being opposed everywhere.
[00:29:05.579 --> 00:29:09.319]  Their plan to roll it out with the COVID fear and the lockdowns failed.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.180]  They're trying to covertly roll it out now.
[00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:17.599]  They are pushing the borders of war that always comes in one of these crises.
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:25.059]  And they are domestically trying to position the public to be declared enemies of the state.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.119]  The prognosis could not be more dire.
[00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:34.700]  On the one hand, there is a great awakening.
[00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.299]  Good things are happening.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:42.799]  But as Dale Bigtree said yesterday, Newtonian physics in the third dimension is king.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.000]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:50.500]  Evil grew.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.519]  Good has grown to oppose it.
[00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:55.200]  Evil is now doubling down.
[00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:02.930]  And officially, and I'm going to go over all the articles, it's everywhere.
[00:30:03.829 --> 00:30:09.670]  Trump supporters are going to stage terror attacks on election day and after during the speeded election.
[00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:15.589]  But don't worry, the executive orders and the Pentagon's ready for civil war and killing American citizens.
[00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:17.990]  That's been out for over a month.
[00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:22.269]  It took me almost a month to even get it on the radar screen.
[00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.750]  We don't have time to...
[00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:30.250]  Like we had in the past, for this stuff to percolate out there.
[00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.369]  And people see it, even when it's admitted, and they go, well, that just can't be true.
[00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:48.509]  We have to assess the situation, and we have to warn everyone, and we have to expose it, and we have to let the globalists know that we're aware that they have cast us, like for a movie, as Hitler terrorists.
[00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.690]  And that they are saying imminently...
[00:30:53.039 --> 00:31:08.259]  Cyber attacks, power outages, murdering black people, murdering Hispanics, and that Trump supporters are going to do it with zero evidence and with a long history of the feds provocateuring terror attacks, fake Whitmer kidnappings,
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.460]  January 6th provocateured actions, the list goes on and on.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:18.660]  And then all of their surrogates are running around, foaming at the mouth, saying...
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.680]  Civil war conditions, armed uprisings by the left, not certifying a Trump win.
[00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:34.579]  So on the one hand, they're doing everything they say we're doing while blaming us.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.940]  And then they're trying to steal the election out in the open.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.619]  It's like watching a beehive.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.079]  I mean, I'm going to get to that.
[00:31:47.299 --> 00:32:05.240]  So that the moment we're in, the history of And I liken it because it's the best analogy I've got to where you see a homeless person.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.680]  I saw this happen 30 years ago or more.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.279]  Just walk out onto...
[00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:15.410]  A major highway in front of cars going 70 miles an hour.
[00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:17.329]  And you see the crazy person walk out.
[00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:19.190]  They're up about 200 yards away.
[00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:20.069]  You see a person.
[00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:21.549]  You see cars up ahead of you.
[00:32:21.589 --> 00:32:22.849]  You go, that person's not going to make it.
[00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:23.450]  Boom!
[00:32:23.569 --> 00:32:23.990]  They're dead.
[00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.089]  You pull over Renderade.
[00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:26.190]  Guts everywhere.
[00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:36.890]  Bloody, you know, 30-yard skid marked their intestines, twisted arms, legs, their shattered face, smashed jaw, teeth splattered on the concrete.
[00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.910]  And there's like a sound when you see that.
[00:32:42.349 --> 00:32:43.369]  Most people hear it.
[00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.809]  I heard it was like a...
[00:32:44.809 --> 00:32:55.630]  Like when he approached the obelisk in 2001 Space Odyssey and he goes...
[00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.009]  Like, wow, this really sucks.
[00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.049]  And I've avoided several times and been T-boned twice.
[00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:06.930]  You're going through the green light.
[00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.869]  You didn't do your job.
[00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:08.789]  You should have looked.
[00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.490]  Oh, crap.
[00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.230]  That person just ran a red light.
[00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:13.990]  Split-second decision.
[00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.849]  What am I going to do?
[00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:16.950]  And everything slows down.
[00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:19.029]  And that's where I am right now.
[00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.809]  These days feel like months.
[00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:26.849]  And...
[00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:35.700]  You look at corrupt elites in the past that get desperate and they make more and more mistakes.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.779]  They double down more.
[00:33:37.079 --> 00:33:40.519]  This particular ruling class has totally inherited all their power.
[00:33:40.619 --> 00:33:41.400]  They don't deserve any of it.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.779]  As Tucker Carlson said, Madison Square Garden is totally on target.
[00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:52.400]  And that makes it more dangerous because they're crazy and ruthless and delusional and megalomaniacs.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:11.630]  And It feels like another time when I was 15 riding with a friend who was older than me in his truck going to see some girls in Dallas.
[00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:18.929]  We were driving across the I-30 bridge to go to Rowlett to go visit some cheerleaders.
[00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:28.840]  He's driving his little Datsun truck And all of a sudden, a Mustang just shoots by us at 120 miles an hour.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.239]  Another Corvette shoots up behind it.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.159]  And it's really pretty heavy traffic.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.960]  Everybody's going about 70 miles an hour.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.000]  It's the bridge over Lake Ray Hubbard.
[00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:44.219]  And Chad was his name, my buddy.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.239]  He slows down.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.519]  He goes, those people are going to wreck.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:54.679]  All of a sudden that Corvette about 200 yards up cuts and its tire blows out.
[00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.860]  And it turns on its nose and spins.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.659]  And I see three bodies because they had a girl right in the middle seat.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.960]  Killed two of the people in the car.
[00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:09.980]  Didn't kill the other guy.
[00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:14.099]  I knew his name was Highwater.
[00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.710]  The car spins.
[00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.670]  I knew him from high school.
[00:35:17.889 --> 00:35:21.750]  The car spins like a tornado and people are flying out.
[00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:26.309]  And they all fly out off the bridge onto the railroad track that ran beside it.
[00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.010]  Not into the lake.
[00:35:29.389 --> 00:35:31.750]  And we get out and render aid and it's the same thing.
[00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:33.789]  And it just feels just like that.
[00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:36.030]  Because it was like slow motion as we're driving up.
[00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.070]  And up in the distance we see the Corvette turn.
[00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:45.599]  Later, the fire department said it was a blown tire, they thought.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.239]  That's what other witnesses closer saw.
[00:35:47.699 --> 00:35:48.679]  Turns, tire blows.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.619]  With people.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.639]  As we get closer, I see people like, what?
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.840]  Then you get out and you go up.
[00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.599]  And their fire ants are already all over them.
[00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:02.659]  It doesn't matter.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.679]  That's what it feels like.
[00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:11.579]  You look at one of the people and there's still blood going...
[00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:14.860]  Out of their carotid artery, and then it stops.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.320]  They're dead.
[00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:23.820]  And I'm sitting here, and it's just like that Corvette just stood up on its nose.
[00:36:24.019 --> 00:36:32.820]  I mean, we know all hell's gonna, and I don't know exactly in this wreck what it's gonna look like or what's gonna happen, but I'm like, baby, it's going down.
[00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:43.960]  Putin comes out this morning.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.260]  Says they're totally prepared for nuclear war and orders his forces on the highest alert for nuclear war drills.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.440]  A week or so after G.G.P. said the same thing.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.920]  So, that's what we're covering.
[00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.519]  Let me just start going into it right now.
[00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.530]  We're in the hands of complete lunatics.
[00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:17.989]  Kamala got up yesterday.
[00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:19.070]  We have the clip of that too.
[00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.289]  She tells the crowd, I don't want you to shout my name.
[00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:24.429]  This is an impromptu moment.
[00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:25.909]  It's why she only reads off a teleprompter.
[00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:33.670]  She goes, shout your name and no one shouts because obviously everybody understands that'll just be like the Tower of Babel.
[00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:34.809]  It'll be like a noise.
[00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:37.730]  Come out of that.
[00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:38.329]  Come out of that.
[00:37:38.429 --> 00:37:38.909]  Come out of that.
[00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:39.369]  No, no, no.
[00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:40.489]  Shout your name.
[00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:42.710]  What kind of just...
[00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.329]  And then laughs like a crazy witch hyena.
[00:37:45.469 --> 00:37:49.269]  I mean, you can't fake this unsavoriness.
[00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.449]  This loathsomeness.
[00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.090]  This otherworldly creepazoid.
[00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.449]  And you're like, well, no one can top her.
[00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.170]  And then they found someone who's just as bad...
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.739]  Ten walls, but this is what Satan gives you.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.619]  This is who works for Satan.
[00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:25.559]  And then as I told you, over and over again, how the archivist find it, I said, I will expect you'll find, I probably said this ten times, Chinese sex operative managing walls, because I know the Chinese intelligence model that is absolutely formulaic.
[00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:36.280]  They get you in a Confucius society in college, give you a bunch of money under the table, have you go to China, get brainwashed, get a sex operative in control of you.
[00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:39.559]  The party will ask you to date one of their daughters and bring them back.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.900]  They'll ask you to set up front company businesses.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:01.170]  And then they'll pay you to bring groups of students back In engineering and in military and in law enforcement who are being trained to get them on the payroll before they get in those professional positions to infiltrate America.
[00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.809]  And now it turns out he had a sex operative just like Swal as well and so many other ones.
[00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.690]  Bing fang.
[00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:13.289]  And it's all over the news and that's the October Republican surprise that Trump talked about a few days ago.
[00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.530]  We'll get to that.
[00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.929]  Of course he had a communist Chinese sex operative.
[00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.789]  He probably wasn't even having sex with her, because I can tell you right now, that guy ain't into women.
[00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:38.409]  But the point is that if I tell you somebody's a communist Chinese agent, they're a communist Chinese agent.
[00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:53.079]  You don't do overseas trips 37 times, we know of, and live there basically, as he said he did, Under the Confucian Society, they got banned under Trump as a Chinese Communist Party intelligence operation.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.639]  It's not like it's a subgroup.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]  It's Chinese Communist intelligence.
[00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:05.219]  So of course he was being handled by a sex operative.
[00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:08.219]  That's what I'm telling you people.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.639]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:40.659]  And then Homeland Security says people that are hard-working, Christian, conservative, decent people who don't want human trafficking and open borders and World War III and pedophilia and a devalued dollar and hyperinflation that we're terrorists that are going to kill the black people and stage terror attacks during a contested election which the Democrats have pledged they're going to contest.
[00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:52.000]  And they've already got symposiums set up about civil war for a week and a half after that they set up months ago.
[00:40:52.179 --> 00:40:57.980]  They've already got the TV programs ready and all the movies that came out before about civil war.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.280]  I told you they don't do that for no reason.
[00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:08.559]  And the Joker movie, the new one and the first one about civil uprising and how sexy it is.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.940]  And then they say, we're doing it.
[00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:17.530]  Alright, I'll start plowing through it.
[00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.349]  Let me just say this.
[00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:26.110]  For 15 weeks, the feds have been trying to shut us down illegally outside of federal court.
[00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:28.650]  The federal judge has now blocked them three times.
[00:41:29.849 --> 00:41:33.969]  But I can tell you, I'm seeing a lot of movement around the place.
[00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:41.369]  And even though we're up for sale on the 13th, they can try to shut us down before then.
[00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.230]  But regardless, we've got backups.
[00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:48.039]  Multiple backups.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:57.219]  But the only thing we need is your word of mouth to share the backups and to follow at AJNLive on X. The All Shows Network at AJNLive.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:58.780]  AJNLive.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:41:59.719]  They're on screen.
[00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:00.579]  Top corner.
[00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:03.920]  And I need funds to fight a war.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.719]  And I'm fighting for you.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.639]  I'm fighting for myself.
[00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:07.639]  I'm fighting for God.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.960]  And we're one of the main, most effective weapons against the globalists recognized by the enemy, thanks to your support.
[00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:17.070]  So I try to make it easy to support us.
[00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:24.150]  Now, I told the great company we're working with that's going out and private labeling the top brands in the country and discounting them for you at thealexhildestore.com.
[00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.570]  I said, look, these are all great supplements.
[00:42:25.889 --> 00:42:29.050]  I know great sea moss is a superfood, hottest thing out there.
[00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:30.530]  All these products are great.
[00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:31.929]  I want a full line of all these.
[00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:38.190]  They launched like six products last week that took months and months and months and months before I even heard about them.
[00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:41.989]  And I brought them in as a sponsor three months ago that we already were working with them and had this all getting set up.
[00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.650]  These just came in.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.179]  $13 when you get a couple packages.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.659]  $14 when you get one.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.860]  30 gummies in each one.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.960]  This is something that everybody can afford.
[00:42:59.059 --> 00:43:00.619]  Pardon me, you guys just popped in my ear.
[00:43:00.679 --> 00:43:01.079]  What'd you say?
[00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:06.019]  Alright.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.639]  So, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.369]  They never pop in my ear very rarely.
[00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.090]  And when they do, usually the mics are turned up so high I can't understand what they're saying.
[00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.170]  So that just becomes this thing.
[00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.250]  I'll actually get to it later.
[00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:22.550]  Maybe I should just leave.
[00:43:22.889 --> 00:43:23.570]  You know what?
[00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.030]  Everybody wants to blow themselves up.
[00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.030]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[00:43:48.319 --> 00:43:49.119]  I can't do the show.
[00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:49.639]  I'm too many right now.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.360]  I just, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[00:44:01.059 --> 00:44:02.699]  I want to smash this desk right.
[00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:03.719]  I want to turn this over.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.260]  So...
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.940]  So...
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.139]  Go to rebroadcast for a while.
[00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:46.099]  ...about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:54.579]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.480]  Alex Jones!
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.119]  Scum!
[00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:08.119]  Russian scum!
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.659]  I think a war has come to mind.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.019]  Your reputation is amazing.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.860]  I will not let you down.
[00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:22.960]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.400]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:33.940]  We think.
[00:45:34.039 --> 00:45:34.599]  Just let me think.
[00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:40.079]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:45:40.219 --> 00:45:40.880]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:41.900]  Damn it!
[00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:42.380]  Why?
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:49.219]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.960]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciations.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.539]  The association of truth is that the truth is that there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:01.539]  You designed it, sir.
[00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:02.519]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:46:02.619 --> 00:46:04.019]  You taught me every television in London.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.559]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:17.940]  And where once you had the freedom to object and to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.699]  How did this happen?
[00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:21.239]  Who's to blame?
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.739]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:26.599]  They will be held accountable.
[00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:32.599]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.329]  I know why you did it.
[00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:36.769]  I know you were afraid.
[00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.050]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:40.969]  War, terror, disease...
[00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:47.110]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:53.309]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:46:53.670 --> 00:47:00.090]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.099]  There is a war.
[00:47:08.699 --> 00:47:09.679]  It's happening now.
[00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:12.260]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.619]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:16.679]  We are the resistance.
[00:47:17.179 --> 00:47:19.139]  We are the Infowar.
[00:47:23.679 --> 00:47:26.639]  All right, I have settled down now.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:36.940]  And I blew up on air for no particular reason, because behind my eyes, I know everything I'm saying is dead on accurate.
[00:47:37.539 --> 00:47:54.079]  And it's absolutely ridiculous that we've gotten this far and that people are so asleep Raised in this culture of television and entertainment to not look around you and see, historically, we are in the most dangerous,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:08.559]  insane, out-of-control time ever, and we have the absolute worst scum of the earth running society that are literally at war with the people, and I can't believe that everyone isn't against these damn people.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.159]  I can't believe I gotta get up here and explain to the feds what a civil war's gonna mean, you dumb bastards.
[00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.329]  I cannot believe I gotta explain to the public how serious all this is.
[00:48:20.429 --> 00:48:22.050]  We are overrun by crooks!
[00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.469]  I'm gonna control myself.
[00:48:35.389 --> 00:48:37.789]  And I swear to God, and I don't mean that in vain.
[00:48:37.809 --> 00:48:38.550]  I mean, I do swear.
[00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.269]  That I'm going to judiciously cover every damn one of these articles.
[00:48:42.429 --> 00:48:43.190]  But I'll tell you what happens.
[00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:49.130]  I get ready for hours at night, hours in the morning, and then I come in here and look at all these clips and all this stuff, and it's just freaking crazy!
[00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:53.329]  These people are nuts!
[00:48:55.929 --> 00:48:59.710]  And there's some demon creature, literally, like, crawled out of hell.
[00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.289]  Walson and Harris.
[00:49:02.489 --> 00:49:04.369]  I mean, I cannot believe what freaks they are.
[00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:08.489]  But this is the judgment God has visited on us.
[00:49:09.159 --> 00:49:14.360]  For the 65 million kids we've killed and all the rest of the crap we've put up with.
[00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:21.800]  And I'm telling you, man, if they get into power now, they've already been in power, but they're going for broke and they're coming after everybody.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.139]  Everything they say about us is what they're planning.
[00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:29.860]  God protect Trump.
[00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:31.159]  That's all I can say.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.519]  All right, look, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:49.159]  I cannot even believe, with our track record of devastating the New World Order, and I'm not bitching, I'm just saying, that I have to sit up here and beg people, when we're under total attack, just to have the funds to continue on to beat these bastards at the most critical time.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.099]  Do you want us on air during the disputed election and martial law attempts?
[00:49:54.539 --> 00:49:57.280]  Do you want us to be calling their moves 10 moves ahead?
[00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:01.920]  For whatever reason, I seem to be one of the only prominent people that knows how to do it!
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.920]  We need to get to the point where I'm obsolete.
[00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:09.519]  And it's starting to happen, but not quick enough.
[00:50:09.679 --> 00:50:12.460]  So I need your support, plus we've got incredible products you need.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.219]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.099]  You sign up for the VIP, you get $40 free a month for products on there.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.920]  You pay $30 a month, you get $40.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.219]  Make money on that.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:29.099]  And if you're supporting us, which it habituates you to do, so you should want to do it as a commitment to remind you, cancel any time.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.719]  Forward slash VIP InfoWars cannot, you know, sustain itself.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.139]  If it's not here, whatever.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:45.739]  As long as I have the funds and the crew, I'll continue on until they pull the internet kill switch or World War III. And if stuff gets crazier and crazier by the minute, we're more important than ever.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.760]  We've been building for 30 years towards this moment.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.820]  So I need you to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:56.519]  I need you to sign up for the VIP program or don't.
[00:50:56.739 --> 00:51:00.360]  We got all these new energy and sleep gummies that are incredible deals.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.059]  Less than 15 bucks a package.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.079]  We got the incredible CMOS, all the great t-shirts and hoodies and other great supplements.
[00:51:09.579 --> 00:51:10.659]  There's been...
[00:51:10.659 --> 00:51:15.099]  How many supplements added the last week that finally came in that are amazing?
[00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.659]  One, two, three, four...
[00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:20.949]  Five, six, excuse me.
[00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:26.289]  Six have been added at thealexjonesstore.com, not five.
[00:51:26.469 --> 00:51:37.510]  And it's all there, and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet, but at least we're in the fight and we're starting to win.
[00:51:38.389 --> 00:51:42.289]  What makes it even more frustrating is we're so close to backing these bastards off.
[00:51:43.969 --> 00:51:48.090]  You can also support our other great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, all the great supplements there.
[00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.190]  And yeah, there's today and tomorrow.
[00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:54.590]  Any purchases you make, put you in a rabble for the truck and the cash prizes and all that stuff.
[00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.369]  So when World War III happens, you have a big truck to drive around in with nuclear war and you're in the wastelands.
[00:52:00.389 --> 00:52:04.510]  So, all right, next hour is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.849]  I'm going to control myself.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.659]  And I'm going to stop preaching and ranting, and I'm going to hit it all.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:19.519]  But man, they're making their move for total martial law, total stolen election, FEMA camps, mass death, gun confiscation, pedophile armies raping your children.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.039]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:28.360]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, yellowshownstore.com.
[00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:34.739]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really...
[00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:38.900]  There's other folks on this, other folks that are great and run this, the folks at Bigly.
[00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.039]  Great Patriot backers, Total Patriots, Jsexers, you name it.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.260]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.199]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:53:00.039]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[00:53:00.519 --> 00:53:02.860]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[00:53:03.159 --> 00:53:07.300]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.480]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[00:53:10.769 --> 00:53:12.130]  Monthly member credits.
[00:53:12.449 --> 00:53:17.769]  Every month, as a VIP member, you get $40 of free store credit.
[00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:19.170]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.650]  That's right.
[00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:23.329]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:27.630]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.
[00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:28.730]  That's $10 you make.
[00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:39.610]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[00:53:40.239 --> 00:53:43.539]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:52.300]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[00:53:53.059 --> 00:53:55.659]  The winner of the sweepstakes we announced the 30th this month.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.679]  You want to win?
[00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:00.530]  I know you do, because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[00:54:00.889 --> 00:54:03.190]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.429]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:07.329]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:10.949]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.690]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.599]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.000]  It just goes on from there.
[00:54:37.259 --> 00:54:39.460]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:41.340]  I don't have millionaire backers.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:46.059]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:47.500]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:54:49.949 --> 00:54:55.510]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:54:55.710 --> 00:55:04.809]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:12.070]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.230]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.170]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.409]  We've already...
[00:55:19.289 --> 00:55:20.369]  Just devastated them.
[00:55:20.489 --> 00:55:23.530]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.090]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:29.369]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:36.889]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these...
[00:55:37.559 --> 00:55:40.059]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.860]  So, again, I don't give up.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.719]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.360]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:55:48.559 --> 00:55:50.820]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.300]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:09.389]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery and you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:11.869]  I mean, it's just...
[00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:13.210]  This is a joke.
[00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.690]  This is ridiculous.
[00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.250]  We're changing the world.
[00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:19.230]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.030]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.150]  Everybody's been shooting their mouths off how they won a bloody war for so long on the left.
[00:56:27.869 --> 00:56:29.889]  They're sure as hell trying to start one.
[00:56:30.449 --> 00:56:35.869]  Once it starts, I guarantee you, every one of these New World Order globalist heads...
[00:56:38.389 --> 00:56:43.650]  It's going to be in a place that's not very good very quickly.
[00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:47.349]  The globalists are going to cut the power.
[00:56:47.489 --> 00:56:48.949]  They're going to release bioweapons.
[00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.150]  They're going to poison the water supply.
[00:56:52.429 --> 00:56:55.409]  So everybody wants to blow up civilization.
[00:56:55.429 --> 00:56:59.590]  Everybody wants to get a big nasty satanic war going on.
[00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:05.230]  Well, there's a real good chance everybody's going to get front row seats to their own death.
[00:57:20.389 --> 00:57:20.849]  All right.
[00:57:24.849 --> 00:57:38.670]  300-plus radio stations don't carry those first five minutes, and it always feels weird because I decided way back in talk radio 20-plus years ago, I said, you know, everybody else just has six minutes of ads the first five, but local stations, you know, play over those.
[00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:43.250]  Why don't I, because we're on the internet as well, just fill that up with some stuff?
[00:57:43.329 --> 00:57:54.119]  And that's what we're doing here, but I'm going to really start the hour at six after, and I will play the clips, and I'm just going to robotically Show what's going on and then give you my take briefly on each one.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:02.400]  But at a certain point, it's diagnosing a dead body.
[00:58:02.699 --> 00:58:04.559]  I mean, it's like...
[00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:09.900]  And I'm not being negative here.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:18.380]  Because when a person's dead, you can't resurrect them unless they've only been dead a few minutes.
[00:58:19.809 --> 00:58:27.510]  But a society and a culture, if you get God back in your life and there's a big enough awakening, people repent, you can turn things around.
[00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:34.030]  But things have gotten completely out of control.
[00:58:36.489 --> 00:58:47.510]  And we've forced the globalists out in the open, so that's very good, because they're going to slowly take over and dumb us down and poison us and kill us with soft-kill systems so we never know what hit us.
[00:58:54.159 --> 00:58:58.300]  So, the good news is we forced the fight out in the open so they can't creep around and do it in the dark.
[00:58:59.739 --> 00:59:03.599]  And enough people know the enemy's game plan that no matter what they do now, they will lose in the end.
[00:59:04.679 --> 00:59:08.300]  The question is, do we get 7 billion people dead or 500 million?
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.239]  And, you know, I like living.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.440]  I like my kids.
[00:59:13.639 --> 00:59:14.599]  I like my wife.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.449]  I'd really like to turn this around and I'm 100% right.
[00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:26.010]  I mean, there's no debating how much trouble we're in, and it's just so stupid.
[00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:43.269]  I cannot believe that we have satanic scum in charge and that people love to follow orders so much and are afraid of the mainstream media still that people just don't come out in complete mass and disconnect from the entire system and tell them go piss up a rope.
[00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:53.469]  Because again, I'm going to say it, and Dale Bigtree said it again yesterday, I got thousands of articles, everything, but I'm not saying this because I don't have anything to say.
[00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:55.530]  Why don't I just say the most important stuff?
[00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.769]  People call in and they say, I'm a hero, and thank me.
[01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.010]  Well, I want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:02.869]  I need your help.
[01:00:04.289 --> 01:00:05.429]  I don't want to get thanked.
[01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.849]  I want to get these people off our backs.
[01:00:07.409 --> 01:00:15.869]  It's not heroic to try to get atrazine out of the water that they put in there to reduce your fertility and give you cancer and bend your gender.
[01:00:17.039 --> 01:00:18.639]  Only the U.S. has it legally.
[01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:20.320]  It's designed to do this.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:29.460]  Why would anybody, even a psychotic that serves the system, why would you want to have a society dumping that everywhere?
[01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:32.059]  And that's the thing.
[01:00:32.159 --> 01:00:33.059]  That's just one thing they're doing.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:39.739]  People need to wrap their brains around just how satanic the globalists are.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.139]  We're going to go to break in five seconds.
[01:00:42.099 --> 01:00:42.980]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:43.099 --> 01:00:43.599]  Stay with us.
[01:00:44.539 --> 01:00:51.440]  Alright, Steven Crowder with huge election fraud, smoking gun evidence of the Democrats bragging about stealing the 2020 election.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.239]  With the undercover video coming up, bottom of the hour.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.639]  Let me go through all the articles that I mentioned, but I want to show you in the last hour.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.480]  So, here's the first big one.
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.099]  All the propaganda, all the preparation...
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:24.219]  That we've seen everywhere was for staging false flags during a disputed election against Trump supporters to frame us as a pretext for martial law, civil war, outlawing of MAGA and literally coming after everyone.
[01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:27.030]  And they're all over the news saying that.
[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:27.590]  Sounds crazy.
[01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.650]  They want physical uprisings and the military to kill us.
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:32.550]  And they've signed the orders.
[01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:36.989]  And then they say, we're going to do that to them because that's what they're going to say while they're doing it to us.
[01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.369]  That's just 101 tyranny takeover.
[01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:48.110]  When a coup is discovered that's bureaucratic, it will always try to take over and use a crisis to demonize its enemies to then outlaw their enemies, which is the American people.
[01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:49.769]  So that's front and center.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:02:06.599]  And then we have pell-mell, wild, race to the finish, bum rush, foaming at the mouth, zombie apocalypse-level election fraud with federal judges all over the country saying illegal aliens are staying on, they're voting, they're going to keep the polling places open for days or weeks,
[01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:12.559]  they don't want postmarks on ballots so they can produce any amount they want after to then get above Trump.
[01:02:13.539 --> 01:02:14.340]  They are...
[01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:15.900]  Not letting Republicans vote.
[01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:17.960]  Keep voting districts all over the place.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.460]  Everywhere the machines break.
[01:02:19.659 --> 01:02:21.639]  Whether 10 people come to vote or 1,000.
[01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:23.980]  If you complain about it, you get arrested.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.239]  I mean, it's just full-on giant theft in front of everyone.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:36.219]  And then the corporate media runs around calling that disinformation.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.440]  And Homeland Security says anyone saying that there's any type of election problems is a terrorist.
[01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:42.659]  But...
[01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:47.050]  The Trump supporters with the Russians are going to try to hack the election.
[01:02:48.170 --> 01:03:04.030]  And they're going to hit the voter registration computers so that no one can tell who can really vote when the motive for the deep state is to hit those databases when the databases discover massive election fraud happening in every major state, not just blue ones or battlegrounds.
[01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:08.739]  And it's all happened.
[01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:15.280]  And it wasn't rocket science two months ago when Homeland Security said, oh, the Trump supporters are going to attack during the election.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:26.659]  And they're going to hit with Russia the voter registration databases when it's the Republicans that want the voter registration databases checked and want the voter ID and who stand to win if there's a fair election.
[01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:29.099]  But the feds say, no, we're going to attack it.
[01:03:29.199 --> 01:03:32.280]  And then magically, when they catch them in Pennsylvania and Georgia and everywhere...
[01:03:32.869 --> 01:03:46.789]  With people voting that were never on the rolls who were not registered or fake registrations being put in, in mass, the databases magically go down so that you can't prove it after they already caught a bunch.
[01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.710]  Oh God, they're fighting it all over in all these counties and all these states.
[01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:53.449]  Well, sorry, that database don't work now.
[01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.130]  Who do you think did that?
[01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.389]  It's the state election officials.
[01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.110]  Okay.
[01:03:59.289 --> 01:03:59.710]  Okay.
[01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:05.150]  Because they've been put in there to do this and they get rewarded like the governorship of Arizona when they do it.
[01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.769]  So, let me just show you what I mentioned.
[01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.250]  Big article on Infowars that links the articles.
[01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.769]  U.S. intelligence claim extremists inspired by conspiracy theories.
[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.489]  Poach major threat 2024.
[01:04:16.889 --> 01:04:18.210]  They say anyone questioning elections.
[01:04:18.489 --> 01:04:27.250]  Trump supporters, they say, are planning violence and other attacks during the election starting in six days.
[01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.010]  It's really already started.
[01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:29.449]  Here's the headlines.
[01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:30.210]  NBC News.
[01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:32.789]  Extremists inspired by conspiracy theories post-major threat.
[01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:34.429]  2024 elections.
[01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:35.710]  U.S. intel warrants.
[01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:39.269]  Maricopa County, it will take two weeks to count the votes.
[01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.550]  It feels like dystopia.
[01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:43.929]  Republican county officials brace for election deniers.
[01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:44.389]  Again.
[01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:46.730]  Oh, that's right.
[01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:48.590]  Even though it was total fraud proven by the legislature.
[01:04:49.289 --> 01:04:52.590]  Iowa poll watchers sound alarm on illegal aliens being allowed to vote.
[01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.909]  And it's all over the local news the illegals are voting with video of it.
[01:04:57.329 --> 01:05:01.269]  And a bunch of states openly are allowing it, but the corporate media says it's made up.
[01:05:01.369 --> 01:05:02.030]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:07.269]  Exposed Wisconsin election loophole allows illegal aliens to obtain ID to vote.
[01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.989]  Hell, Texas announced it a month ago.
[01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:14.130]  Voters in Georgia, Texas, Tennessee report voting machines flipping their selections.
[01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:18.769]  This is pouring out, confirmed, they're getting photos of it all, just like MTG said two weeks ago.
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:27.510]  Swing states Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia under fire for election oddities like 500,000 people not on the voter rolls allowed to vote in Michigan.
[01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.590]  Huge article with all the different links to it on Infowars.com.
[01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:38.010]  Far-left media launches all-out Trump-Hitler blitzkrieg still even after Madison Square Garden.
[01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:41.550]  CNN, Trump may win the popular vote.
[01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.070]  That's why they're so panicked right now.
[01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:50.949]  Then you've got the firebombing in Oregon and Washington of the drop boxes.
[01:05:55.710 --> 01:06:01.750]  Nevada mail-in ballots without postmarks can be counted to three days after Election Day, court rules.
[01:06:04.869 --> 01:06:12.849]  And again, you can't prove it got mailed, you can't prove where it even came from, but magically, up to three days after, they're going to count them.
[01:06:15.019 --> 01:06:16.960]  Talk about the fix being in.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.920]  Absolutely outrageous.
[01:06:23.559 --> 01:06:32.639]  Democrat operative details illegal ballot harvesting schemes used during U.S. elections appears to admit 2020 election frauds occurred in Georgia.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.500]  Well, the Democrats do voter registration drives of illegals all over the country.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.619]  Breaking.
[01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:43.360]  Demoperative caught an undercover video explaining how they allegedly stole the 2020 election.
[01:06:45.079 --> 01:06:51.920]  From kicking out GOP poll watchers to nursing home ballot harvesting to identifying a driver in 2,000 mules.
[01:06:55.099 --> 01:06:58.960]  Meanwhile, Whoopi Goldberg says Trump's going to break up interracial marriages.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:10.039]  Pennsylvania GOP committee woman taken away in handcuffs for encouraging people to stay in line to vote.
[01:07:11.509 --> 01:07:16.070]  Pennsylvania, yeah, they tell them on video, you only ought to be here if it's very important.
[01:07:16.389 --> 01:07:17.289]  Get out of here.
[01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:22.610]  Pennsylvania GOP committee woman taken away in handcuffs for encouraging people to stay in line and vote.
[01:07:23.929 --> 01:07:25.409]  Nothing short of voter suppression.
[01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.550]  RNC sounds alarm of vote access issues in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.670]  Breaking.
[01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:33.849]  Washington, Oregon.
[01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:36.150]  Drop-off ballot boxes on fire.
[01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:37.809]  Unknown number of ballots destroyed.
[01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:43.789]  This is third world corruption.
[01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.329]  Swing state Georgia.
[01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:48.150]  Democrats are suing to prevent dropbox surveillance.
[01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:55.989]  Can anyone give one logical explanation as to why Democrats would be suing in a swing state to prevent dropbox surveillance?
[01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:03.409]  Because they don't want their people pulling up with 20, 30, 40, 50 ballots, taking photos of them to get paid and loading them in.
[01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.469]  Got a video clip of that.
[01:08:08.679 --> 01:08:09.380]  Not good.
[01:08:09.579 --> 01:08:11.300]  These reports are pouring in.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:20.899]  Someone found a box full of ballots and other documents on exit 11 of the intersection of 211th Street and Coulter Bay, Florida.
[01:08:21.159 --> 01:08:28.119]  He immediately picked them up and took them to a police station where they have been properly secured.
[01:08:28.119 --> 01:08:31.680]  No information yet on who's responsible or how they got there.
[01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:36.699]  The Democrats always get caught dumping and burning and sinking Republican districts.
[01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.010]  Republican precincts.
[01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.949]  Is this happening in Florida?
[01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.090]  Just imagine.
[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:45.170]  If this is happening in Florida, just imagine what's happening in Detroit, Philly, and Atlanta.
[01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.710]  Bolton County, Georgia almost blocked Republican from voting.
[01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:56.390]  Oregon, Washington ballot boxes set on fire.
[01:08:56.489 --> 01:08:57.029]  I already mentioned that.
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.289]  Nevada Supreme Court count.
[01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:01.670]  Nevada Supreme Court count.
[01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:08.329]  Says they can count unmarked ballots for three days after the election.
[01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:15.829]  Republicans turn to Supreme Court to dispute over Pennsylvania and provisional ballots, which they found a whole bunch of are fake.
[01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:19.949]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:26.430]  Provisional ballots must be counted if mail-in ballots are disqualified.
[01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:28.310]  PA Supreme Court rules.
[01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:29.430]  That's down on the Supreme Court.
[01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:36.890]  Virginia asks U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate removals Of people that were illegal aliens on the voter rolls.
[01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:41.829]  Nevada Supreme Court rejects GOP mail ballot challenge.
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:47.270]  The Hill doesn't tell you that they let them count unmarked, unpostmarked ballots for three days after.
[01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.069]  Alright, so that's that stack.
[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:57.229]  I got a bunch of clips from newscasts just in case you want to go to InfoWars, you can watch those for yourself.
[01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:02.029]  Then we've got more election meddling.
[01:10:03.859 --> 01:10:07.199]  Google won't send out voter reminders to conservatives.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.859]  Google blocks all the positive news and all Republican candidates from even showing up in search results unless it's negative.
[01:10:13.119 --> 01:10:15.539]  Everything's positive about Kamala and the Democrats.
[01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:19.680]  The congressional hearings for years about how this skews elections massively.
[01:10:20.119 --> 01:10:21.939]  And now as I predicted...
[01:10:23.049 --> 01:10:36.850]  YouTube, that Rogan's on, he expanded back to YouTube from Spotify, shadow banned and hid the search results for his Trump interview, so it only got 36 million views the first three days, when I guarantee it would add 100 million views.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.510]  And now it's come out that indeed it was shadow banned.
[01:10:40.789 --> 01:10:44.489]  Election interference, Rogan Trump interview censored on YouTube.
[01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:46.149]  Big article on Infowars.com.
[01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:53.840]  Elon Musk says, full episode of Joe Rogan and the real Donald Trump available on X. They uploaded it last night.
[01:10:54.619 --> 01:10:57.699]  YouTube experienced some technical difficulties.
[01:10:57.979 --> 01:10:58.840]  Of course they did.
[01:10:58.939 --> 01:11:00.819]  It's called shadow batting, I said.
[01:11:01.979 --> 01:11:03.100]  So there you go.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.819]  But now J.D. Vance is going to be on Rogan tomorrow.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.260]  So that's interesting.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.939]  Alright, continuing now.
[01:11:20.039 --> 01:11:22.260]  Mention this, now let's talk about it.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.239]  And I'm on record saying he fits the exact profile of a communist Chinese agent.
[01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:37.960]  In his policies, in his actions, in his rhetoric, in being a Confucian society operative, 37 at least trips...
[01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:45.079]  Bringing people that they want to target to be spies to China to be bought off with money, gifts, and sex.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:55.060]  And then when you become a made member of the Communist Party as an operative, they make you have a girlfriend or wife who's a daughter of a party official.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.920]  And that's exactly what was happening here with Walls.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.500]  But at some point, he kicked her to the curb, and they used the standard thing of, oh, she'll commit suicide if you don't take her back.
[01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:15.000]  Tim Walls has been infiltrated by the CCP after a torrid relationship with officials' daughter, top lawmakers say.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:24.739]  I have a really good friend I've known for 22 years who's a very well-known media person who I worked with for a long time.
[01:12:26.579 --> 01:12:28.260]  And I was over there visiting him in England.
[01:12:28.479 --> 01:12:30.260]  This has got to be like 15 years ago.
[01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.180]  He was with her about five years.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:43.859]  And he's younger than me, and he married a Chinese, spoke good English student going to the local university there.
[01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:50.039]  And I met her a few times and talked to her, and I thought, man, this is a communist Chinese agent.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:13:01.760]  And years later, he divorced her and left her because it turned out she was, and her family were party officials, and they tried to pressure him to be their operative agent.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.300]  That's how many of these there are.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.460]  So, I know a lot about this.
[01:13:09.699 --> 01:13:10.220]  Alright?
[01:13:11.239 --> 01:13:18.859]  Tim Walls, if you think about Fing Fang, or whatever her name is, the sex operative with Swallowswell, the congressman.
[01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:25.920]  Tim Walls has been infiltrated by the CCP after a torrid relationship with officials' daughter.
[01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:31.380]  Top lawmakers say Republican lawmakers are warning that Democrat VP Tim Walls is compromised.
[01:13:32.729 --> 01:13:39.289]  They told the Daily Mail exclusively uncovered he had a fling for the Chinese official's daughter decades ago.
[01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:49.289]  Wall's trips with Jenna Wang, the daughter of a high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official, has lawmakers worried with seven days of the election.
[01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:56.109]  The House Oversight Committee has been investigating Tim Walls for his ties to China and CCP entries since August.
[01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:07.210]  After the relationship that began in 1989 was exposed, the committee's Chairman exclusively told the Daily Mail that Walls has been compromised by China.
[01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:17.850]  Governor Tim Walls documented a relationship with Chinese Communist Party affiliated entities and officials bears hallmarks of CCP infiltration and influence campaign, Comer said.
[01:14:19.029 --> 01:14:21.510]  Here is the sex operative right here.
[01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:31.449]  Jenna Wang pictured then and now reveals the two were forced to keep their relationship from her father who would disavow it.
[01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.930]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:35.779]  And that she was going to commit suicide when he left her.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.319]  Right.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.920]  Gotta love that cover story.
[01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:42.100]  Jesus Christ.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:51.659]  China saw Tim Walz as a target before VP picked and somehow they can get to DC. Internal DHS reports.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:52.680]  Yeah.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.060]  He's been watched forever.
[01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:55.760]  He's a damn communist Chinese spy.
[01:14:57.539 --> 01:15:04.739]  Tim Walz accused of pushing Chinese Communist Party officials' daughter to bring up suicide during stormy tossed love affair.
[01:15:05.119 --> 01:15:06.680]  Made me feel cheap.
[01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:09.520]  That's what he does.
[01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:13.460]  Suspected Chinese spy reportedly slept with courted U.S. officials.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.300]  I mean, this goes on.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.260]  So there's that.
[01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:22.579]  And then we've got stuff like this.
[01:15:23.239 --> 01:15:26.819]  We've got it with English dubbed onto it.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.939]  Putin launches nuclear war drill after Xi Jinping a week and a half ago said prepare for total war.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.920]  Now there's North Korean troops.
[01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:42.770]  We're good to go.
[01:15:43.090 --> 01:16:00.550]  We're good to go.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:08.359]  And now Putin's come out and said with all that's going on, he has his forces doing major nuclear drills to prepare for nuclear war.
[01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:17.039]  Five weeks after Biden announced and greenlit the United States and Europe to start bombing Russia with heavy cruise missiles inside Russia, including Moscow.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.380]  That's a great idea.
[01:16:21.699 --> 01:16:23.699]  Israel's ongoing bombing Iran.
[01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:28.000]  Their next attack's reporting to be their nuclear facilities and their leadership.
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.739]  Iran's sitting there taking it so far.
[01:16:34.399 --> 01:16:37.960]  Will the globalists stage false flags and blame Iran as the pretext?
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:50.300]  Will they kill Trump with a service-to-air missile and blame Iran and then get Trump and get the Iranians and then have terror groups, stage terror all over America, bring in martial law and say Iran did it?
[01:16:50.359 --> 01:16:53.039]  Or will Iran really do it once their leaders get targeted?
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.819]  I mean, they're non-military leaders like the Ayatollah.
[01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:03.029]  So, it's total insanity.
[01:17:05.489 --> 01:17:07.529]  The BRICS has overtaken the dollar.
[01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.010]  Inflation's out of control.
[01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.189]  The borders are wide open.
[01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:12.710]  Pedophilia's openly being promoted.
[01:17:14.829 --> 01:17:18.270]  We are in total and complete absolute cuckoo land.
[01:17:22.529 --> 01:17:26.510]  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris...
[01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:31.539]  He's running around acting more unhinged and more insane every day.
[01:17:31.659 --> 01:17:32.439]  We'll get to some of that in a moment.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.180]  But first, here's Vladimir Putin today.
[01:17:36.579 --> 01:17:38.840]  Dear comrades, good afternoon.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:44.000]  Today we're conducting another Strategic Deterrence Forces training.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:49.939]  We'll practice nuclear weapon control procedures with actual ballistic missile launches.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:57.239]  I'll note that Russia maintains its stance that nuclear weapons use is an absolute last resort.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:08.500]  However, we recognize the nuclear triad as our key security guarantor, enabling strategic deterrence and maintaining global nuclear balance.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.800]  It's crucial for global stability.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:20.199]  Given rising geopolitical tensions and new external threats, it's vital to have modern combat-ready strategic forces.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.439]  We'll keep improving all components.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.760]  We have the resources for this.
[01:18:25.859 --> 01:18:30.079]  We won't join an arms race, but we'll maintain sufficient nuclear capability.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.859]  Well, Russia purportedly has more nuclear weapons than anybody, so that's really an understatement.
[01:18:41.479 --> 01:18:48.760]  Here's Kamala, in a rare unscripted moment, making bizarre witch faces, jack-o'-lantern faces.
[01:18:52.409 --> 01:18:54.689]  Saying, don't shout my name, shout your name.
[01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:57.470]  And then everybody's totally confused because nobody's ever done that in history.
[01:18:57.569 --> 01:18:58.850]  And it just creates total confusion.
[01:18:59.210 --> 01:19:00.890]  How would you not know that?
[01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:06.270]  Because the woman is an empty vessel.
[01:19:07.449 --> 01:19:09.930]  So when the demon's not in her, she just kind of can't talk.
[01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:14.289]  When the demon's in her, though, she just does all this weird gremlin stuff.
[01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:16.350]  And then...
[01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:22.010]  She gets asked about Trump wanting her to do a cognitive test and you get the blank stare.
[01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:23.529]  Let's play those clips back to back.
[01:19:30.609 --> 01:19:37.529]  Okay, now I want each of you to tell your own name.
[01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:38.130]  Do that.
[01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:42.970]  Because it's about all of us.
[01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:44.329]  It's about all of us.
[01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:49.029]  And listen, I have fought my whole career to put the people first.
[01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:59.630]  Donald Trump was on Joe Rogan and he called you, Madam Vice President, a very low IQ person and said, I think she needs to take a cognitive test.
[01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:02.510]  I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing.
[01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:04.350]  There's something wrong with her.
[01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:10.550]  And then she can't even answer.
[01:20:11.579 --> 01:20:16.039]  Now, this is just a snapshot of what you see on Instagram, Facebook, exits everywhere.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.720]  And they have a right to be liars.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:22.279]  But Republicans against Trump does this every day.
[01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:28.180]  They will show footage of the Trump rally five hours before he gets there.
[01:20:29.439 --> 01:20:31.079]  Three hours before it starts.
[01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:34.069]  And we'll show a sparse crowd.
[01:20:34.670 --> 01:20:36.810]  And then we'll say, look, no one's here for this.
[01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:41.529]  When you just saw Kamala's rally yesterday, it's like a gymnasium.
[01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:42.229]  Very small.
[01:20:42.409 --> 01:20:43.369]  Maybe like 400 people.
[01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.750]  And then we have the footage later when Trump's actually there.
[01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.210]  There's not one seat in the House.
[01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:51.029]  They turned away reportedly thousands in Atlanta.
[01:20:51.449 --> 01:20:54.470]  Let's play the deceptive footage and then the real footage.
[01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.989]  Roll them both.
[01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:01.609]  Very importantly, at taxpayer expense, by the way.
[01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:05.090]  If she lied about working at McDonald's, she never worked at McDonald's.
[01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:14.510]  On top of all this, in conclusion, take a look.
[01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:16.890]  She wants to turn our military woke.
[01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:18.350]  I don't think that's happening.
[01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.989]  Go ahead.
[01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:34.529]  And that's a confusing clip.
[01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:38.010]  It's got another one where it's before he gets there and then it cuts to him later and it's a big crowd.
[01:21:38.109 --> 01:21:41.130]  The point is, everybody knows Trump has the biggest crowds.
[01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:46.270]  They just continue to try this crap over and over and over again.
[01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:54.050]  Like saying Trump is Hitler because 85 years ago there was a Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden.
[01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:56.029]  It's bizarre.
[01:21:57.449 --> 01:22:01.289]  But it's all they've got and it's their goal.
[01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:12.430]  All right, Stephen Crowder and his investigative unit just continues to rival the great work of James O'Keefe.
[01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:13.210]  They're not in competition.
[01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:13.930]  We're all friends.
[01:22:14.069 --> 01:22:16.909]  I mean, we hope we all rival each other.
[01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.430]  We want to beat the globalists, but I mean, it's the only way to describe it.
[01:22:19.529 --> 01:22:27.010]  These are bombshells that his investigative unit continues to get, and they got an insider Democrat admitting to everything, basically.
[01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:28.329]  That's coming up.
[01:22:29.439 --> 01:22:33.119]  And then I'm going to continue with all the election fraud news that's coming in.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:44.020]  The rollout of the North American Union Central Bank Digital Currency passport that'll control every aspect of your life under the guise of a vaccine passport.
[01:22:44.039 --> 01:22:45.000]  That's under the radar.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.199]  We're going to put it on the radar.
[01:22:47.319 --> 01:22:52.579]  We have a bunch of other huge news concerning all of this and more.
[01:22:52.579 --> 01:22:54.140]  And I intend to open the phones up.
[01:22:54.949 --> 01:22:59.689]  In the third hour and fourth hour, I'm hosting all fourth hours right through the election.
[01:23:00.069 --> 01:23:01.590]  It's going to be heavily disputed.
[01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:02.810]  The Democrats have promised that.
[01:23:03.489 --> 01:23:10.449]  Unless they run a sneak attack and steal Texas, it could be over next Tuesday night.
[01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:12.369]  But hey, we're all going to find out, aren't we?
[01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:13.630]  Stay with me.
[01:23:13.729 --> 01:23:15.390]  I'm Alex Jones and PollWars.com.

[01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:24.619]  To every citizen who's sick and tired of the parasitic political class in Washington that sucks our country of its blood and treasure.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.699]  Would you have done something differently than President Biden?
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.079]  There is not a thing that comes to mind.
[01:24:30.319 --> 01:24:33.699]  November 5th will be your liberation day.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.500]  November 5th, this year, will be the most important day in the history of our country.
[01:24:40.699 --> 01:24:43.300]  Because we're not going to have a country anymore if we don't win.
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.760]  Between now and election, it's a sprint.
[01:24:46.119 --> 01:24:56.340]  It's a sprint for the spirit of this country and your ability to choose what you watch, who you support, and the mere ability to speak.
[01:24:56.779 --> 01:25:03.579]  The left is constantly engaged in foul play, but their first choice would be to not have to cheat.
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:04.210]  Right?
[01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:14.390]  To do it with lies by omission, by using media bias, by throttling searches, by flat-out censoring searches, as we've seen from Google and YouTube, as we've seen with Facebook and Meta in the past.
[01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:16.850]  It's lie, lie, lie, cheat.
[01:25:17.829 --> 01:25:19.590]  We all know who Donald Trump is.
[01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:21.069]  He will be a dictator on day one.
[01:25:21.289 --> 01:25:21.729]  Dictatorship.
[01:25:21.810 --> 01:25:22.750]  Nazi imagery.
[01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:23.409]  Made off Hitler.
[01:25:23.569 --> 01:25:23.770]  Hitler!
[01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.189]  Hitler!
[01:25:24.449 --> 01:25:24.449]  Hitler!
[01:25:29.130 --> 01:25:31.029]  As I was saying...
[01:25:32.829 --> 01:25:35.310]  And that's why we are gearing up for the election live stream of the century.
[01:25:35.409 --> 01:25:37.590]  November 5th, we'll have the live electoral integrity map.
[01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:44.409]  No one will have the data that we have on that night to call, dispute states, and let you know everything that is going on across this country.
[01:25:44.529 --> 01:25:48.310]  If there is any foul play whatsoever, there's no reason to tune in anywhere else that night.
[01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:50.189]  The election live stream of the century.
[01:25:50.289 --> 01:25:56.890]  November 5th, this year, will be the most important day in the history of our country.
[01:25:57.069 --> 01:26:01.090]  And we will make America great again.
[01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.770]  The election livestream of the century, November 5th, 2024.
[01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:07.710]  Be there with us.
[01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.909]  Fight like hell.
[01:26:10.489 --> 01:26:16.909]  Now, a lot of people are tuning in, tens of millions of new people every day here, and they're like, wait, is this the Alex Jones show or the Stephen Crowder show?
[01:26:17.829 --> 01:26:18.989]  Let's get one thing straight.
[01:26:18.989 --> 01:26:20.310]  I want to beat the New World Order.
[01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:25.069]  I'm not in competition with Tucker Carlson, President Trump, Elon Musk.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.659]  Dana White, Joe Rogan.
[01:26:28.859 --> 01:26:30.439]  I'm in competition with the New World Order.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.359]  I'm trying to save our country and the world.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:43.380]  And Steven Crowder's great team up in Dallas has invested millions of dollars to go and pay And it's taken them...
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.939]  They've been doing this for six months.
[01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:47.239]  I know the Inside Baseball, they're now revealing it.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.819]  To get all the licenses and pay all the money to get what the networks get.
[01:26:52.199 --> 01:27:07.260]  When you saw Fox announce that Nevada had gone to Biden four years ago, they had the credibility because they were dialed in to these government state consortium databases.
[01:27:07.819 --> 01:27:11.479]  It used to be called EAS. But the point is...
[01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:15.779]  Is that nobody but the networks has access to this.
[01:27:17.479 --> 01:27:21.039]  And they brought in experts to be able to read it all, cover it all.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:22.640]  They're going to have live election night coverage.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:36.119]  And because they're in that database, when the Democrats dispute it and try to drag it out, which may happen, if there's a decisive victory by Trump so huge they can't, or the Democrats could flip Texas through fraud and suddenly Kamala is the winner.
[01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:37.930]  We're going to find out.
[01:27:38.029 --> 01:27:39.510]  I believe it's too big to rig.
[01:27:39.609 --> 01:27:40.369]  The landslide's too big.
[01:27:40.449 --> 01:27:40.930]  That's my gut.
[01:27:41.029 --> 01:27:41.670]  I agree with Tucker Carlson.
[01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:45.449]  But I'm leaning towards it's going to get drug out.
[01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:55.449]  That's most of the deep state preparation for the Civil War conditions Jamie Raskin calls for and James Carble for the, quote, armed uprisings so that Trump doesn't kill the black people.
[01:27:56.710 --> 01:28:01.149]  Total insanity makes no sense like the Madison Square Garden Nazi stuff, but they're doing it.
[01:28:01.819 --> 01:28:13.260]  And there's evidence of huge illegals voting and letting people use unmarked, unpostmarked stuff in Nevada for days after so they can create whatever fraud they want.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.420]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.539]  And so Stephen Crowder and his team will be simulcasting a lot with them.
[01:28:20.989 --> 01:28:36.850]  Because we're going to say, okay, let's get an update, and we're going to be going to them a lot, back and forth, because they're bringing the technology and the experts so that when they're trying to call stuff or say this or that, because a lot of times corporate media actually won't even show you what's really going on,
[01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:39.590]  they have invested millions.
[01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:50.130]  I mean, almost everything that comes in on this, this is a big deal, and I... Not predicting, but it's leaning towards taking at least a week or longer so the database will be even more important.
[01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.529]  I don't think it'll just be election night.
[01:28:51.829 --> 01:28:56.449]  This is going to go on and be so important with the war room that they've set up.
[01:28:56.550 --> 01:29:06.029]  And Stephen also wants to get into all of the craziness going on right now and what the consequences of a Kamala victory would be.
[01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:10.250]  Wire News Outlet's not endorsing Kamala.
[01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:12.409]  That's a big deal.
[01:29:12.529 --> 01:29:13.829]  I'm glad he's raising that.
[01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:25.010]  The next Trump talking point, it went from disbanding the Constitution to Trump is a Nazi to Trump is going to deport spouses of interracial marriages.
[01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:26.630]  What do they have left?
[01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.369]  We got Whoopi Goldberg saying that preposterous garbage.
[01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:30.850]  So Stephen Crowder, I bring him up on air.
[01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:32.510]  Very exciting time.
[01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:33.750]  It was an exciting time in my life.
[01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:35.470]  What an incredible time, my friend.
[01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:38.909]  I'm so glad you guys have done what no other independent media has done.
[01:29:38.909 --> 01:29:41.109]  You guys have really doubled down here.
[01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.470]  Well, thank you very much, and thank you for that intro.
[01:29:44.649 --> 01:29:51.590]  And yeah, we appreciate, you know, when we say this is the only place people need to tune into, we mean as far as not having to rely on CNN or Fox News to call states.
[01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:57.609]  Obviously, people are going to have their own streams going on, but we're going to be doing it just as well, if not better, on election night.
[01:29:58.430 --> 01:30:02.909]  We're basically lifting our sleeves as magicians saying, this is what they do.
[01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:04.829]  These are the resources they have.
[01:30:04.949 --> 01:30:11.590]  We have them as well, but we also have experts with experience in the field who can read some of this data and give you an accurate snapshot, right?
[01:30:11.630 --> 01:30:16.409]  We're not going to be shining your rear with this, but we want people to actually know what is going on.
[01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:18.409]  And unfortunately, you know this, right?
[01:30:18.569 --> 01:30:20.289]  Data analysts, they tend to be a nerdy bunch.
[01:30:20.369 --> 01:30:21.810]  They don't tend to be the best communicators sometimes.
[01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:23.409]  So being able to...
[01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:26.810]  Being able to communicate that in a way, okay, this is what you need to know.
[01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:28.590]  This is the contrast from the last election.
[01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:29.649]  This is where we are.
[01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:30.789]  I felt so helpless.
[01:30:30.789 --> 01:30:41.689]  I talked about this the last election with Arizona, and I believe it was, I believe now the revised is 0.000045, don't quote me on that, percent of the vote where they called Arizona.
[01:30:42.449 --> 01:30:44.729]  And I thought, hold on a second, how are they doing it this early?
[01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:46.590]  That can't be right, and it's so close.
[01:30:46.949 --> 01:30:48.409]  But there was nothing I could do.
[01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:52.170]  And so we got a lot of feedback from people saying, well, we really like tuning in to you for the entertainment, right?
[01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:54.609]  The sketches, the bits, the guests, the cross streams, and the drinking game, all that.
[01:30:54.689 --> 01:30:56.050]  We're going to have all of that and more.
[01:30:56.329 --> 01:31:01.909]  But some people were saying we still had to, unfortunately, tune in to legacy media to see how the states were being called.
[01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:04.310]  It's very expensive to get these news wires.
[01:31:04.489 --> 01:31:08.550]  It's very expensive to be able to actually analyze voter rolls.
[01:31:09.029 --> 01:31:24.399]  We've covered our bases and then added on top of that Investigative journalists, boots on the ground in the major swing cities, in the major swing states, and a volunteer army, in addition to that, of thousands, so that people can go to the electionintegritymap.com and in real time not only see the electoral map and how it's shaping up,
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:28.779]  but they can also click a pop-open window and say, oh, what's going on?
[01:31:28.819 --> 01:31:30.600]  A pipe burst in Georgia, for example?
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.000]  This is hypothetical.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.100]  Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.000]  What happened in Arizona?
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.300]  They're not going to be able to count votes.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:38.739]  Or there was an entire precinct where they couldn't have people vote for four hours.
[01:31:38.819 --> 01:31:39.220]  Or wait, wait, wait.
[01:31:39.319 --> 01:31:39.640]  What happened?
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.319]  They're bringing red wagons filled with ballots.
[01:31:42.479 --> 01:31:42.779]  Oh, no, wait.
[01:31:42.899 --> 01:31:43.520]  Is it film equipment?
[01:31:43.659 --> 01:31:43.880]  No, wait.
[01:31:43.939 --> 01:31:44.220]  That's right.
[01:31:44.319 --> 01:31:44.779]  It's ballots.
[01:31:44.939 --> 01:31:45.340]  Now they're boring.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.380]  That happens.
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.960]  We will have people there.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.840]  Because it's too important at this point.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.420]  So many times people say, well, what can we do?
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:52.880]  What can we do?
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.340]  And the only answer is, well, go out and vote.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.000]  We encourage everyone to do that.
[01:31:56.119 --> 01:32:00.239]  We encourage everyone to use their platform, even if it's their family or community, to change minds.
[01:32:00.939 --> 01:32:02.319]  But we wanted to be able to do more.
[01:32:02.539 --> 01:32:03.960]  And yeah, it's expensive.
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:08.199]  Every now and then I get a little moment of panic when I'm like, oh gosh, we're doing all of this that night.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.880]  It's probably going to be, gosh, a 12-hour stream.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.399]  Who knows?
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.840]  But look, it's looking good right now.
[01:32:14.119 --> 01:32:17.420]  I think your gut, I would tend to lean that way.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.300]  Here's my prediction.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.920]  If it's a blowout, it's Donald Trump.
[01:32:21.359 --> 01:32:25.439]  If Kamala Harris wins, it has to be, she has to win by a hair, right?
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.220]  It could go close either way.
[01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:36.640]  But if it's a walk-off, it would kind of have to be Donald Trump based on the paths to victory that we already know of in tandem with some of the early voting data.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.079]  It's not 100% reliable.
[01:32:38.659 --> 01:32:41.439]  But again, facts and statistics don't exist in a vacuum.
[01:32:41.619 --> 01:32:46.340]  We always try and bring it back to comparing this to 2016 and 2020.
[01:32:46.539 --> 01:32:50.619]  Not 2022, because a lot of people talk about how they underestimated Democrats.
[01:32:50.939 --> 01:32:56.079]  Well, the truth is the Republicans have always outperformed their polling performances.
[01:32:56.810 --> 01:33:00.390]  When Donald Trump is on the ticket, that's what people mean to say.
[01:33:00.569 --> 01:33:01.649]  That's the clarifier.
[01:33:02.069 --> 01:33:04.010]  And yeah, we're excited to have you here too.
[01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:04.630]  And what are you doing?
[01:33:04.689 --> 01:33:05.930]  You look like you're withing her weight.
[01:33:05.989 --> 01:33:06.890]  You look like you're losing weight.
[01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:12.609]  You look like I hit shift, the shift key, and condensed Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:25.750]  Yeah, I mean, I decided to up my game about 12 weeks ago, so I actually take all our supplements now, and I'm working out more, and just decided that the world's so crazy that I need to get my act together.
[01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:29.689]  So yeah, I've lost 30 pounds as of this morning on the scale.
[01:33:30.329 --> 01:33:34.130]  30 pounds, and I intend to get even smaller, another 30 pounds.
[01:33:34.989 --> 01:33:35.869]  Good for you.
[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:40.890]  See, when I gain weight, it's right in my, I don't know if I can say, I'll say butt, butt and face.
[01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:42.649]  So there's no good way for me to gain weight.
[01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:44.590]  So I just starve myself or throw up.
[01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:50.939]  Well, you look great, and you're doing a great job, and your crew's doing a great job, and this is the next level.
[01:33:51.279 --> 01:33:53.500]  We're not the independent or alternative media.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.380]  We are the media, and Trump finally gets that.
[01:33:55.659 --> 01:34:02.859]  You've had audiences for a decade bigger than mainstream media, so have I, and the top news shows have a few million viewers.
[01:34:03.039 --> 01:34:12.340]  All our shows have way more than that, and so we're really at a moment where even the older folks are now realizing that corporate media is not just the enemy of the people, it's a facade.
[01:34:13.159 --> 01:34:13.560]  Yeah.
[01:34:14.489 --> 01:34:20.250]  No, you know, what's really crazy, too, is I don't know if you've covered yet Kamala Harris on Club Shay Shay.
[01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:24.069]  I feel like a jackass saying that as a grown man.
[01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:26.350]  His name is Shannon Sharp, but we must call him Shay Shay.
[01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:27.189]  Respect to Mr.
[01:34:27.369 --> 01:34:27.449]  Shay.
[01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:28.149]  I'll call him Mr.
[01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:28.409]  Shay.
[01:34:28.689 --> 01:34:35.220]  He was on with Kamala Harris, and she was talking about You know, your Fifth Amendment, Fourth Amendment, she said, and I support the Second Amendment.
[01:34:35.479 --> 01:34:40.300]  And he said, and you know, don't forget, the First Amendment, too, if he wins people like me, we might be gone.
[01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:41.060]  I'm going, hold on a second.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:47.840]  Does anyone believe for a moment that if Donald Trump becomes president, that he is going to silence Mr.
[01:34:48.039 --> 01:34:48.539]  Shea Shea?
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:56.760]  Now, on the flip side of that, hey, would a Kamala Harris administration try and silence or censor Joe Rogan?
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.359]  Oh, wait, they did it.
[01:34:58.739 --> 01:35:00.500]  They created a department of misinformation.
[01:35:00.699 --> 01:35:02.279]  People don't remember Nita Jankiewicz.
[01:35:02.359 --> 01:35:03.720]  She only had a job for about a month.
[01:35:04.119 --> 01:35:08.979]  Remember Jen Psaki saying Spotify needs to remove Joe Rogan episodes, and Spotify did.
[01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:11.859]  They capitulated to the tune of, I believe it was 80-something episodes.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:12.779]  Don't quote me on that.
[01:35:12.859 --> 01:35:19.319]  Steven, she's on record saying we can't allow Elon Musk to have free speech on X. We've got to have controls over that.
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:28.189]  I mean, they're the party of censorship, and then they claim Republicans are because they don't want to give elementary school students pro-pedophilic Graphic porno books.
[01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:29.630]  That's not censoring.
[01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:33.010]  It's not banning alcohol to not give liquor to five year olds.
[01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:36.310]  It's not banning porn to not give it to five year olds.
[01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:38.069]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:35:39.199 --> 01:35:39.439]  Right.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.159]  No, it really isn't.
[01:35:40.159 --> 01:35:48.319]  By the way, the big difference, too, between even, first off, people are forgetting that it was Tipper Gore, right, where they said that video games make you become a mass shooter, and that's why we have the parental advisory.
[01:35:48.479 --> 01:35:49.520]  So it wasn't just Republicans.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.319]  But if you look at conservative Christians, use South Park as an example.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.020]  Conservative Christians didn't want South Park on in prime time.
[01:35:56.119 --> 01:36:00.859]  They wanted it on later at night because it was a cartoon, and they were worried that kids would watch that content.
[01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:05.590]  The left today says there can be no South Park because it's offensive.
[01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:12.510]  The left says there can be no comedians at rallies in a venue that regularly hosts comedians at Madison Square Garden.
[01:36:12.630 --> 01:36:14.449]  If the left doesn't like it, it can't exist.
[01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:16.350]  But we don't need to live in a hypothetical.
[01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:18.390]  When she's sitting there with Mr.
[01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:21.770]  Shay Shay saying, hey, yeah, they might remove your First Amendment.
[01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:26.189]  We know that she will because her administration already tried to do it.
[01:36:26.289 --> 01:36:30.819]  And when they try to say that Donald Trump is a Nazi, Alex, I've been doing this thought exercise, okay?
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.039]  Because we do have a mixed audience.
[01:36:32.199 --> 01:36:33.239]  People who don't like Trump.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:36.979]  I go, okay, let's assume everything that they say is true, politically speaking.
[01:36:36.979 --> 01:36:40.239]  That the unemployment is at an all-time low.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.920]  That inflation is taken care of.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.739]  That the border is secure.
[01:36:42.819 --> 01:36:44.380]  All those things now that we know they lie about.
[01:36:44.439 --> 01:36:47.199]  But let's assume that someone believes that.
[01:36:47.479 --> 01:36:47.800]  Okay.
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:54.979]  Do we really think that people are going to believe, considering they lived through four years of Trump, that he's going to be a Nazi?
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.000]  That he's going to jail journalists?
[01:36:57.159 --> 01:36:59.659]  I mean, it's a cell that just isn't working anymore.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.760]  That's the chasm that we're seeing.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:08.079]  That's the widening that we're seeing from those in legacy media and the average American, including Americans who don't like Trump.
[01:37:08.079 --> 01:37:12.300]  There are very few people in this country who actually believe that he is Hitler.
[01:37:12.479 --> 01:37:27.029]  So when MSNBC and CNN goes up there, and they actually cut in intersplice footage of a Nazi rally, With his at Madison Square Garden, I said, well, why don't you interplace FDR, LBJ, George W. Bush, I believe Barack Obama as well.
[01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:29.310]  They all hosted rallies at Madison Square Garden.
[01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.310]  Absolutely.
[01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:32.470]  But, Stephen, they've doubled down, and you wanted to get into this, so here's the clip.
[01:37:32.710 --> 01:37:33.949]  This is Whoopi yesterday.
[01:37:34.569 --> 01:37:37.710]  Trump's going to ban multiracial marriages?
[01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:40.649]  He's never said anything about multiracial marriages.
[01:37:40.869 --> 01:37:45.109]  It's literally like saying, well, like they've been saying, Trump's coming to kill you with the military.
[01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:59.590]  We're good to go.
[01:38:08.079 --> 01:38:13.100]  If saying, because Nazis 85 years ago had a rally at Madison Square Garden, he's a Nazi.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:13.920]  Hitler drank water.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:14.680]  Trump drinks water.
[01:38:14.939 --> 01:38:15.960]  Hitler takes naps.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:16.939]  Trump takes naps.
[01:38:17.199 --> 01:38:18.159]  Hitler wears clothes.
[01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:18.880]  Trump wears clothes.
[01:38:19.039 --> 01:38:24.300]  But it's even crazier to say he's going to ban multiracial marriages out of clear blue sky.
[01:38:24.439 --> 01:38:24.939]  Let's play this clip.
[01:38:26.039 --> 01:38:27.779]  He's talking about you.
[01:38:27.779 --> 01:38:28.500]  It's us.
[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:33.130]  He's not gonna say, oh, you're with a white guy.
[01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:35.470]  I'm gonna keep you from being deported.
[01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.210]  No, he's gonna deport you and put the white guy with someone else.
[01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:39.470]  The man is out there.
[01:38:41.569 --> 01:38:45.170]  So now if you deport criminals, it's banning multiracial marriages.
[01:38:45.329 --> 01:38:46.109]  Boy, that's a stretch.
[01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:48.649]  You know who's not buying it?
[01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:50.369]  Hispanic voters.
[01:38:50.829 --> 01:38:51.689]  Record numbers.
[01:38:51.869 --> 01:38:56.029]  Donald Trump, I believe, is ahead in Nevada, behind in Arizona with Hispanic voters.
[01:38:56.210 --> 01:39:02.970]  Still the fact that it's even close because what has changed is the rhetoric from the left where they are now saying he hates Hispanic people.
[01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:03.670]  And you know what?
[01:39:03.789 --> 01:39:07.170]  It's an insult to the intelligence of Hispanic Americans.
[01:39:07.329 --> 01:39:16.970]  The idea that Donald Trump is going to then arrange, assign you to a white woman, there's nothing that he has said that has even been remotely close to that.
[01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:17.510]  It's hilarious.
[01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:18.630]  That's the issue at this point.
[01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:20.010]  It is quite funny.
[01:39:20.529 --> 01:39:24.310]  But again, Hispanic voters are just like they rejected Latinx.
[01:39:24.449 --> 01:39:25.770]  It is so insulting.
[01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:26.550]  And here's the thing, too.
[01:39:26.729 --> 01:39:32.670]  Look, with Kamala Harris, here's why I think you're seeing a lower voter turnout from the left right now thus far.
[01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:33.529]  Things can change.
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:35.899]  I believe that intellect is a little overrated.
[01:39:36.039 --> 01:39:40.180]  I've said this before, where at a certain point you're beyond that sort of bulk of the bell curve.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.060]  You're smarter than average.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:44.340]  At a certain point, it's not the most important leadership quality, right?
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.380]  Quick decision-making ability, executive function, those matter.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.479]  But you do need a baseline level of intelligence.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:50.659]  Okay, but it's overrated.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.960]  That being said, Kamala Harris is a moron.
[01:39:54.039 --> 01:39:57.680]  And I mean, she is a fundamentally incredibly unintelligent woman.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.800]  And you've never heard me say that about Barack Obama.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.439]  You've never heard me say that about Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:03.920]  I don't like them, but they're not dumb people.
[01:40:04.039 --> 01:40:09.920]  And for the party of intelligentsia, I think it's got to be really hard to have someone like this as their ambassador.
[01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:20.050]  Well, did you see her latest thing where she tells the crowd, don't shout my name, shout yours, and they're all totally, I mean, it's just no understanding of how anything works.
[01:40:20.649 --> 01:40:22.170]  So let me ask you this.
[01:40:23.039 --> 01:40:28.840]  And I know you want the report to speak for itself, but your investigative unit is doing the best work ever.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:29.899]  It's amazing.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.199]  This is James O'Keefe level, which is the platinum standard.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.520]  So you want the report to speak for itself, because they'll misrepresent what we've said and done.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.300]  But here's the headline.
[01:40:37.659 --> 01:40:45.880]  Democrat operatives to tell the illegal ballot harvesting scheme used to rig U.S. election, that's the enforce headline, appears to admit 2020 election fraud occurred in Georgia.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.739]  Here's another one breaking.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.520]  Dem operative caught an undercover video explaining how they allegedly stole the 2020 election in Georgia.
[01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:57.649]  From kicking out GOP poll workers to nursing home, ballot harvesting, identifying a driver and 2,000 mules.
[01:40:57.810 --> 01:40:59.250]  That's the Gateway Pundit headline.
[01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:01.710]  Just talk about the investigative unit.
[01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:07.310]  I know you want the report to speak for itself, all vetted by lawyers, everything, but just in general, wow, this is a pretty big deal.
[01:41:08.479 --> 01:41:09.180]  Well, it is.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:17.800]  Now, this came to us from a third party who exclusively sent it to our investigative unit, to be clear, because they're working on some other leads that they're chasing down and setting up in swing states right now.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:30.180]  This is a worker who said the things that people on the right have been suspecting, only he said that, yes, that's a part of what we do, or that's a part of how you can do this.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.039]  So it's interesting that he said that.
[01:41:32.779 --> 01:41:37.739]  There have been calls and emails sent to people who would be in charge of investigating that.
[01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:39.789]  And yeah, look, it's one of those things.
[01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:41.050]  We all agree.
[01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:43.750]  We all agree there's some level of voter fraud, right?
[01:41:43.869 --> 01:41:46.590]  Does anyone out there believe that there's 0% election interference?
[01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:48.729]  Does anyone out there believe that there's 0% voter fraud?
[01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:50.229]  Okay, no one believes that.
[01:41:50.369 --> 01:41:53.109]  So then you say, to what degree is it taking place?
[01:41:53.109 --> 01:42:01.810]  If it's not zero, is 0.2%, which is all that's needed in some of these swing states, Is that plausible?
[01:42:02.069 --> 01:42:02.689]  Is it enough?
[01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:05.189]  And I've talked about this, and by the way, we've covered this for a long time.
[01:42:05.289 --> 01:42:06.970]  We're going to be doing it on election night.
[01:42:07.130 --> 01:42:09.789]  It's November 5th, I believe, 6 p.m.
[01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.050]  Eastern.
[01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:11.510]  You can watch on Rumble or on YouTube.
[01:42:11.829 --> 01:42:17.010]  There's five ways we walked through this, because I feel like a lot of people know election interference happens, but it happens five different ways.
[01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.170]  Number one, the biggest way is media malpractice.
[01:42:19.369 --> 01:42:21.369]  Hunter Biden laptop, that changes the election.
[01:42:21.489 --> 01:42:28.489]  You look at the censoring, deplatforming people like you, demonetizing people like us, deplatforming us from Facebook temporarily, or suspending us during the election.
[01:42:28.569 --> 01:42:29.430]  Okay, that all affects it.
[01:42:29.529 --> 01:42:29.630]  All right.
[01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:33.550]  Then you have a second one, weaponizing the DOJ, which goes back to issue number one, right?
[01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:38.890]  You convince people that Donald Trump is a felon based on trumped-up charges and try and render him ineligible.
[01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:58.579]  That, to me, is We're good to go.
[01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:09.250]  Actual voter fraud, ballot harvesting, ballot stuffing, anomalies on the day of election.
[01:43:09.409 --> 01:43:21.909]  People who only focus on number five are losing the big picture, and you can't fight back on number five unless you push back initially on number one, which is the media malpractice, and that's why we're doing the election livestream of the century.
[01:43:22.130 --> 01:43:28.449]  We want to make sure that none of this happens under the table, in the dark, so everyone can see it in real time.
[01:43:28.449 --> 01:43:30.289]  And we are going to show our work.
[01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:32.310]  We're going to show you how we do our tricks.
[01:43:32.449 --> 01:43:35.750]  If that means we can't do it again, because other people will copy us, great.
[01:43:35.989 --> 01:43:37.270]  Our country's better off.
[01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:38.970]  Let's expand on that.
[01:43:39.650 --> 01:43:55.489]  As Professor Epstein exposed in Congress eight years ago and four years ago and on my show, and I think he's been on yours, one of the leading experts on this, Google can get 10, 15, 20 points by just delisting Republican candidates, blocking information, not sending out voter reminders to conservatives.
[01:43:55.789 --> 01:43:59.250]  They do it to all Republican candidates now, unless it's Liz Cheney.
[01:43:59.710 --> 01:44:04.770]  And that's the real fraud up front, is the information control that the media line...
[01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:09.250]  Kamala paying for tens of thousands of fake headlines in newspapers that are run online.
[01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:12.369]  You know, she's outspending Trump with TV ads three to one.
[01:44:13.050 --> 01:44:15.430]  She's getting 90 plus percent of the big corporate donations.
[01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:16.170]  You're right.
[01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.609]  That's where the real fix is there.
[01:44:18.970 --> 01:44:22.170]  But despite all that, the populism has woken up so much.
[01:44:22.329 --> 01:44:23.510]  Corporate media is so discredited.
[01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:26.609]  It's not working on a large growing population.
[01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:29.270]  And that's why the establishment is in such crisis mode.
[01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:30.310]  So let's get your predictions straight.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.760]  Oh, there's my favorite dog.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.560]  That's the coolest dog.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.920]  Sorry, Joe Lewis came in here.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.659]  We have some beef jerky around.
[01:44:35.779 --> 01:44:38.439]  He can always be on TV. That's the coolest dog ever.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.140]  No matter what we say, people talk about the dog.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:41.779]  That's how it works.
[01:44:42.979 --> 01:44:44.500]  So, hey, just zoom in on the dog.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.060]  I love that dog.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:46.340]  Joe Lewis.
[01:44:46.859 --> 01:44:49.899]  The Democrats are saying they're going to contest the election no matter what.
[01:44:49.939 --> 01:44:50.960]  They're not going to certify it.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.600]  All these states are preparing to wait weeks.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.180]  All this craziness is going on.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:03.060]  Yeah, my prediction is, sorry, I know we're distracted by the cute dog because we're all children at heart.
[01:45:03.859 --> 01:45:06.460]  Look, It could be called early.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.220]  There could be some upsets, right?
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.199]  It could be done that night.
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:15.479]  And dear God, I hope so, because we've promised that we're not going to end the stream until people know who the next president is going to be.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.439]  It could end early.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.859]  I mean, if you look at North Carolina, you look at Georgia.
[01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:21.579]  I mean, she just pulled two million in advertising out of North Carolina.
[01:45:21.699 --> 01:45:22.520]  I don't know if you guys saw that.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:23.880]  That just happened a couple hours ago.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:27.579]  So it seems like she's bracing for a loss, North Carolina, Georgia.
[01:45:28.079 --> 01:45:38.470]  And if you add something that's an upset, whether it's a Virginia, New Hampshire, a long shot, And then you add Nevada, which we should know, election night, the chances of him winning go up really, really high.
[01:45:38.529 --> 01:45:42.630]  That in combination with early voting numbers, and there are people watching it like hawks.
[01:45:43.239 --> 01:45:43.720]  Right now.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:48.619]  And it's no small thing that they know we have people who are also watching our investigative units, right?
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:52.020]  People don't know where our folks may be, where our eyes and ears are.
[01:45:52.819 --> 01:45:54.920]  I think it may be too big to steal.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.600]  Like I said, they would always prefer not to.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:04.680]  In other words, they would always prefer to just engage in media malpractice before they have to get to the final fail-safe, which would actually be direct election interference.
[01:46:04.899 --> 01:46:05.239]  But you know what?
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:05.739]  Here's the thing.
[01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:08.500]  I don't care anymore to say it out loud.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.199]  People used to say, you can't talk about that.
[01:46:10.279 --> 01:46:16.039]  Or they tried to make you feel like you were really a pariah if you said, I don't think it was the freest and fairest election.
[01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:17.880]  And yet so many conservatives bending the knee.
[01:46:18.079 --> 01:46:18.399]  Nope.
[01:46:18.699 --> 01:46:20.600]  You can tell me what you want.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.380]  I've looked at the numbers.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.199]  We've covered it extensively.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.159]  I don't believe it was a free and fair election.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:33.279]  And when you compare where we are right now, where Donald Trump is right now to the last election and even 2016, It's not even close.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:38.800]  And if you just take the performance that Donald Trump has seen, he's outperformed his polling averages.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.659]  If you just take that number, cut it in half, it's still a walk-off.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.000]  That's right.
[01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:44.699]  So stopping there, we're out of time.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:48.640]  No one's gonna buy an election theft, though there's a lot of evidence they're trying it.
[01:46:49.159 --> 01:46:50.539]  Come back on before the election.
[01:46:50.739 --> 01:46:52.260]  I'll be simulcasting some with you.
[01:46:53.239 --> 01:46:55.180]  I think it's going to go for days and days.
[01:46:55.319 --> 01:46:56.319]  We're going to find out.
[01:46:56.439 --> 01:46:57.479]  But great job.
[01:46:57.619 --> 01:47:01.500]  Can't wait to be simulcasting some on election night with you guys.
[01:47:01.819 --> 01:47:02.720]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:02.779 --> 01:47:03.739]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.119]  It's all about the people's independent media publicly superseding the corporate.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.279]  Dinosaur media.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.960]  Steven Crowder, thank you so much.
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:12.560]  Thank you, brother.
[01:47:12.699 --> 01:47:13.159]  Appreciate it.
[01:47:13.279 --> 01:47:13.920]  I'll see you soon.
[01:47:14.199 --> 01:47:14.520]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:18.520]  And again, we'll put his graphic on screen as we end the hour and we'll put our graphic as well.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.359]  We're all here just to get the truth out.
[01:47:21.539 --> 01:47:28.960]  Very exciting election live stream of the century over on Rumble and over on YouTube with the great folks with Stephen Crowder.
[01:47:29.039 --> 01:47:39.819]  Be sure to check that out and right here at InfoWars and of course at Real Alex Jones on X. We'll be streaming out there as well and simulcasting with those folks popping in on some of the other live feeds as well.
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.199]  We're good to go.
[01:47:42.199 --> 01:47:54.520]  We're good to go.
[01:47:58.970 --> 01:48:00.770]  However you're listening or watching, spread the word.
[01:48:00.909 --> 01:48:01.829]  That's how we reach more people.
[01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:03.010]  That's how we win the Infowar.
[01:48:03.250 --> 01:48:04.670]  And support us.
[01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:06.590]  We need funds to fight the globalists.
[01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:10.470]  Whatever happens to Infowars, support our sponsors so we continue on regardless.
[01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:12.869]  And that's at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:48:13.069 --> 01:48:19.409]  Two days left to buy a product and get put in a raffle for the great truck and the cash prizes and all that stuff at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:23.689]  A whole bunch of new amazing supplements, t-shirts, and everything there at...
[01:48:24.970 --> 01:48:25.930]  Thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:35.890]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydro Force.
[01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:39.590]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:47.850]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:49.909]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients.
[01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:53.329]  There's three pages of them here and what they do.
[01:48:53.529 --> 01:49:09.239]  But it's got super high quality vitamin C, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[01:49:09.859 --> 01:49:10.699]  and more.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:12.619]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[01:49:12.859 --> 01:49:18.520]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:40.380]  And then it funds my broadcast, We're good to go.
[01:49:43.579 --> 01:49:52.899]  The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:57.180]  And we found a top company with top reviews that would let us private label it.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.840]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[01:50:00.119 --> 01:50:02.640]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.279]  It's a super food.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.180]  It's a pre-workout.
[01:50:05.239 --> 01:50:06.159]  It's a post-workout.
[01:50:06.279 --> 01:50:09.920]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[01:50:10.529 --> 01:50:19.890]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:26.750]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:29.090]  This baby is next level.
[01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:35.069]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:46.109]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:48.630]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.069]  So there's a line out the door.
[01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:58.569]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[01:50:58.909 --> 01:51:00.149]  And why is that?
[01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.850]  Well, it's simple.
[01:51:00.949 --> 01:51:04.829]  This is called Ultimate HydroForce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[01:51:05.439 --> 01:51:09.039]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:12.899]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.500]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.880]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexYoungStore.com.
[01:51:32.939 --> 01:51:34.640]  Now listen up!
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:39.399]  We are six days out from the election of all time.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.199]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:51:49.319 --> 01:51:52.939]  The suspense, the craziness is just so off the charts.
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:52:02.840]  I am going to give out the number on the election, on the world, what you're seeing on the ground, what you think is going to happen.
[01:52:03.789 --> 01:52:08.329]  What do you think of Homeland Security predicting imminent terror attacks by Republicans with no evidence?
[01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:12.909]  Because that's what everybody else isn't touching on because it just sounds too scary.
[01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:14.270]  Well, that's what the globalists do.
[01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:20.869]  And so, yeah, Trump's set to win in a landslide, but they're going to try to steal it and they're going to try to demonize us.
[01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:22.189]  We'll be right back to cover it all.
[01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.869]  On Tuesday, October 14th, 2024.
[01:52:28.369 --> 01:52:35.529]  In 28 days, Infowars goes up for sale and the bad guys say they're going to try to outbid the good guys and shut us down.
[01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:40.329]  Well, regardless of what happens, I'm going to stay on the air.
[01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:47.630]  And I know those of you watching and listening think the same thing because you love America, you love freedom, and you're not rolling over to the globalists.
[01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:52.590]  You're not rolling over to their censorship and their bullying and how they've terrorized the American people.
[01:52:52.710 --> 01:52:56.250]  You're fired up and you are part, you are at the heart of the Great Awakening.
[01:52:56.449 --> 01:52:56.810]  Now...
[01:52:57.079 --> 01:53:04.260]  We make it really easy to ensure no matter what happens to Infowars, we stay on the air and keep fighting without missing a beat.
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:17.260]  And the way to do that is to support our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, with incredible t-shirts, amazing ball caps, hoodies, you name it, that spread the word and promote a message of liberty.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.119]  And you also meet like-minded people while you do it.
[01:53:19.199 --> 01:53:21.739]  There's also incredible supplements for years.
[01:53:22.119 --> 01:53:34.119]  Irish sea moss has been all the rage as the superfood because just in the concentrated moss itself, it's full of one of the best types of iodine that is such a key in our entire body.
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:44.579]  But then it's got all of these other superfoods and ingredients in it that just turbo charge the entire body, particularly the thyroid and all your hormones in your body.
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:54.420]  The endocrine disruptors The weed killers, the atrazine, all the glyphosate that's in the food, the water, everywhere, suppresses that and blocks that.
[01:53:54.619 --> 01:53:59.239]  That's why using the compounds God gave us does incredible things.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:08.819]  Now, we sold out of the first round of concentrated gummies, Irish sea moss, ultimate sea moss, thealexjohnestore.com, but more is coming in next week.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:18.920]  But they just got in yesterday, the Powdered capsules of it that don't taste great like the gummies, but dissolve in your stomach so you never taste it.
[01:54:18.939 --> 01:54:25.399]  So it doesn't matter that are twice as strong when it comes to the iodine and the other key compounds in it.
[01:54:25.619 --> 01:54:26.760]  Now the gummies are amazing.
[01:54:26.859 --> 01:54:27.520]  People are going to love them.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.819]  You get instant energy from them, but it takes a few weeks for the iodine to really kick in, so you really feel it.
[01:54:32.039 --> 01:54:37.739]  But with these capsules, they are actually a little bit more than twice as powerful with the main ingredients.
[01:54:37.939 --> 01:54:45.760]  So believe me when I say you want to go to the alexjonesstore.com, look at the ingredients list, and then research the ingredients for yourself, because it's not just the sea moss.
[01:54:45.859 --> 01:54:46.579]  It's a superfood.
[01:54:46.699 --> 01:54:52.739]  It has the iodine and a bunch of other vitamins and minerals and key trace elements in it, so it really gets into your blood, really gets into your cells.
[01:54:52.949 --> 01:55:00.029]  I was already incredibly excited about Irish CMOS because I know about the rave reviews, but since I've been taking it, it is insanely good.
[01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:06.050]  I've just now started taking, yesterday, the capsules, and they're even more incredible than the gummies.
[01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:15.100]  So, for adults, for children, for old folks, for everybody, You want to get Ultimate CMOS at thealexjonesstore.com and it funds our operation.

[01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:07.770]  Please visit now thealexjonesstore.com and I thank you all for your past support and ask you now more than ever to commit at this critical time.
[01:56:23.210 --> 01:56:25.569]  Alright, we are now into hour number three.
[01:56:25.789 --> 01:56:29.090]  I'll be hosting right through hour number four for the next two hours.
[01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:34.069]  And I intend now to open the phones up for first-time callers.
[01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:35.590]  That means first-time callers.
[01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:38.909]  To give your take on what I've just covered in the last two hours.
[01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:40.590]  Your own angles, your own ideas.
[01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:41.829]  We need to brainstorm this thing.
[01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:44.590]  Now, we've proven over and over again...
[01:56:45.670 --> 01:57:02.930]  Why the globalists hate us, is that I study history, I study the West, I study the East, I study the current globalist configuration, I study their opposition, both domestically and internationally, and I've learned it's very easy to do if you're actually just not naive,
[01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:05.409]  but they pre-program and get ready.
[01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:11.409]  And so I've been up here, really the only talk show host doing this, and I don't want to be the only one doing it.
[01:57:11.409 --> 01:57:13.010]  I don't want everybody to get this so we can stop it.
[01:57:14.039 --> 01:57:18.760]  We're good to go.
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:31.500]  We're good to go.
[01:57:33.069 --> 01:57:36.210]  Former CIA, FBI on TV. The government's going to kill this guy.
[01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:38.430]  We need Homeland Security to wage war against the supporters.
[01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:41.449]  Once he's been dealt with, we're going to take this guy out.
[01:57:41.569 --> 01:57:42.770]  We're going to liquidate him.
[01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:47.210]  U.S. senators, multiple ones have said that on TV. I mean, my God.
[01:57:48.829 --> 01:57:51.670]  What do you think the CIA's done over 100 times in other countries?
[01:57:51.949 --> 01:57:52.550]  Overthrown them.
[01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:58.350]  They've already overthrown the bureaucracy, and now we're trying to get control of the government back peacefully.
[01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.630]  And so they're like, really?
[01:57:59.729 --> 01:58:02.350]  We're just going to blow stuff up and blame it on you and create martial law.
[01:58:02.369 --> 01:58:02.949]  How's that sound?
[01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:06.789]  And they've signed the executive orders and ordered the military to prepare for it, and it's public.
[01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:12.369]  So almost everybody else is running around.
[01:58:13.289 --> 01:58:14.029]  Woo-hoo!
[01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:15.210]  Trump's going to win!
[01:58:16.029 --> 01:58:16.949]  And, you know...
[01:58:18.859 --> 01:58:19.819]  And that's all great.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:24.539]  And yeah, Trump is obviously super popular, more than 2016 or 2020.
[01:58:25.859 --> 01:58:34.500]  And the way the Democrats are acting and getting ready for civil war and all this, and they tried to kill him twice, I think he can override it.
[01:58:34.979 --> 01:58:37.359]  And a lot of data and numbers obviously go into that too.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:42.279]  And they know they're being watched, so they're like, hell yeah, illegal aliens vote.
[01:58:42.439 --> 01:58:50.789]  Hell yeah, we're going to have unmarked ballots days, weeks after we just count And unlimited supply with having no idea where they came from.
[01:58:50.909 --> 01:58:53.930]  And yeah, we're leaving millions of people on the databases that never voted.
[01:58:53.949 --> 01:58:55.029]  We don't even know who their names are.
[01:58:56.670 --> 01:59:00.050]  So, the good news is we forced them out in the open.
[01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:08.130]  The bad news is, other than Steve Bannon, who just got out of jail last night, I talked to him this morning, he'll try to come on the air tomorrow.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.520]  Almost no one else even understands the situation we're in.
[01:59:15.979 --> 01:59:25.439]  I mean, Musk is hardcore on the open borders and the New World Order and the pedophiles and the World War III and the censorship, and he's kicking ass on all that, and so is Trump.
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:29.880]  But everybody's reactive.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:32.420]  We react to what they're currently doing.
[01:59:36.479 --> 01:59:36.960]  So...
[01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:42.289]  Let's say you own a couple hundred acres on the edge of town.
[01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:48.569]  And you got your little house and you're living there and you see a guy pull back in the woods on your property.
[01:59:48.689 --> 01:59:49.210]  You wonder, who's that?
[01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:49.949]  I don't know that truck.
[01:59:50.409 --> 01:59:55.949]  And you see a guy get out and start setting up a little pop-up ground stand.
[01:59:55.949 --> 01:59:56.729]  He's in camouflage.
[01:59:56.949 --> 01:59:57.689]  He's got a deer rifle.
[01:59:58.609 --> 01:59:59.550]  It's deer season.
[02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:02.550]  You know, I don't have any deer hunters on my property.
[02:00:02.569 --> 02:00:03.189]  I don't know who that is.
[02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:05.390]  You drive over and you say, hey man, who are you?
[02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.770]  What are you doing?
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.640]  And they just say, I don't exist.
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:10.180]  I'm not here.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.779]  Well, you got a truck, got a Ford truck right there.
[02:00:12.859 --> 02:00:13.399]  You're wearing camo.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:17.439]  You got a.308, looks like a Savage rifle right there.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:20.539]  Maybe it's a Ruger or Marlin.
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:22.300]  You're on my property.
[02:00:22.439 --> 02:00:24.039]  And they just go, I'm not on your property.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:25.100]  I don't exist.
[02:00:26.079 --> 02:00:27.579]  And you're like, well, you're right there.
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:29.119]  I'm going to call the police.
[02:00:30.819 --> 02:00:33.960]  But see, we don't control the Justice Department, so they'll never respond.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:35.479]  It'd be like the police didn't exist.
[02:00:36.119 --> 02:00:37.539]  You're now with a trespasser.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.180]  You have to deal with it because the cops won't come.
[02:00:40.439 --> 02:00:42.760]  And you're like, listen, I'm about to throw you off my property.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.560]  Get out of here.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.859]  Now, there's two parts to that little story I just thought of in my head as an analogy.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:55.420]  A, you know he's there to illegally hunt on your property because he brought a gun, how he's dressed, what he's setting up.
[02:00:57.079 --> 02:01:00.460]  And B, when you tell him, get off your property, he won't even admit he exists.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.279]  And that's the psychological thing they do.
[02:01:03.779 --> 02:01:12.520]  So the globalists are all setting up martial law, saying they are, getting all the executive orders and Pentagon directives ready, and then saying they're going to do it.
[02:01:14.939 --> 02:01:22.000]  While they say we're going to do it, because they think low-information voters somehow will think it's Trump's fault or our fault when this all goes down.
[02:01:23.479 --> 02:01:27.060]  And then because there's not a Justice Department to stop it, it's running it.
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:30.300]  It just turns into vigilantism, basically.
[02:01:31.159 --> 02:01:32.640]  And that's what gaslighting is.
[02:01:32.979 --> 02:01:44.600]  I mean, for decades, they have world government summits and call for world government and list all the horrible things they're going to do to us and the medical tyranny and owning our bodies and depopulating us.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:50.159]  And then I write articles and go cover it and the New York Times would say, oh, that doesn't exist.
[02:01:50.399 --> 02:01:52.020]  They don't really even do that now.
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.119]  They just ignore it.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.859]  And it's the same thing, it's gaslighting.
[02:01:58.579 --> 02:02:01.079]  Oh, there's no inflation, or okay, it's Trump's fault.
[02:02:02.039 --> 02:02:04.840]  Or I'm not going to ban fracking, it's just my official policy.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:08.060]  Or I don't want your guns, that's preposterous, I've just sworn to ban them.
[02:02:10.039 --> 02:02:17.100]  And it's meant to have you engage them where you're trying to have a conversation and they'll never even respond that they're there.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.739]  It's total disrespect, but it's beyond that.
[02:02:20.859 --> 02:02:24.220]  It's a tactic hoping you just throw your hands up and walk away.
[02:02:24.699 --> 02:02:26.500]  But they've hijacked our country.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:28.060]  They're trespassing on our rights.
[02:02:28.199 --> 02:02:29.600]  They're holding us hostage.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.100]  These are real terms.
[02:02:31.899 --> 02:02:34.140]  And they're saying, oh, you're getting uppity?
[02:02:36.279 --> 02:02:41.659]  You're standing up and you're saying that you want your rights back?
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:44.399]  How about we blow something up?
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.300]  How about we kill some black people?
[02:02:47.819 --> 02:02:52.420]  You notice we're telling everybody you're going to kill black people and Hispanics.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.399]  And we're going to blame you for it.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.260]  How's that sound?
[02:02:57.739 --> 02:02:59.699]  And you can see it all laid out.
[02:03:01.579 --> 02:03:05.859]  And I'm sitting here going, they didn't call Madison Square Garden a Nazi rally for no reason.
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.380]  They're planning to have white supremacists kill some black people.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:12.619]  I mean, that's the logical next step from people that have been caught doing that before.
[02:03:14.859 --> 02:03:22.880]  They're going to frame us with a Reichstag, January 6, 2.0, Governor Whitmer-style fake kidnapping operation.
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.520]  Think of all the crap they've been caught doing.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.159]  Oklahoma City, the list goes on and on.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.920]  And what are they going to do?
[02:03:31.979 --> 02:03:34.920]  And then they'll deny they did it, just like when they blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[02:03:35.819 --> 02:03:36.579]  Who they blame?
[02:03:36.659 --> 02:03:37.279]  They blame Putin.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.300]  Even though they now admit they did it.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:42.000]  And Biden said, I'll blow it up.
[02:03:42.079 --> 02:03:42.539]  And then he did.
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:45.279]  So, that's the gaslighting.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:46.619]  I'm going to blow that pipeline up.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.020]  It won't be there if you do this.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:49.600]  Okay, blow it up.
[02:03:49.819 --> 02:03:50.479]  Hey, you blew it up.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:51.020]  No, I didn't.
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:51.479]  You did.
[02:03:56.479 --> 02:04:01.420]  So, when they never admit what they're doing, that's a military tactic.
[02:04:02.699 --> 02:04:05.340]  You know, if you go back to World War I, that's when they really got into this.
[02:04:05.439 --> 02:04:10.199]  The Germans and the other groups they were fighting, the Allies...
[02:04:12.130 --> 02:04:16.149]  Against the Austrian Hungarian Empire, the Germans would get on loudspeakers.
[02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:18.189]  They were sound speakers by then.
[02:04:19.649 --> 02:04:24.689]  First time those were used, they would bullhorn on huge PA systems in English.
[02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:26.770]  We are not attacking.
[02:04:27.090 --> 02:04:27.890]  The war is over.
[02:04:28.090 --> 02:04:28.829]  Everything's fine.
[02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:30.710]  Just put your hands up.
[02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:40.569]  Now, 95% of the troops on average, this happened a bunch in the last year of the war, Would say, this is BS. Get ready.
[02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:41.470]  It's an assault.
[02:04:41.670 --> 02:04:44.369]  But a few percentage points would say, that's reasonable.
[02:04:44.369 --> 02:04:44.970]  It's over.
[02:04:45.170 --> 02:04:46.090]  Let's be friends.
[02:04:48.630 --> 02:04:53.649]  And the historical understanding of that is where you get things like The Road Warrior.
[02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:56.729]  What a classic Australian movie with Mel Gibson.
[02:04:57.170 --> 02:05:00.630]  It's the sequel to Mad Max.
[02:05:00.729 --> 02:05:01.630]  Another great classic.
[02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:02.489]  Really low budget.
[02:05:02.609 --> 02:05:03.029]  Excellent.
[02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:07.189]  And Humongous pulls up at the oil refinery and he wants the oil...
[02:05:08.090 --> 02:05:11.189]  And he says, if you just leave the oil, I won't kill you.
[02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:16.470]  And of course, there's a hundred people or so inside and almost all of them go, that's pure crap.
[02:05:16.569 --> 02:05:17.750]  Humongous is a psychotic.
[02:05:17.890 --> 02:05:18.489]  He's going to kill us.
[02:05:18.569 --> 02:05:19.130]  We got to fight.
[02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:22.729]  But one guy goes, humongous is a reasonable man.
[02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:33.250]  And of course, anybody that gets in his hands, he tortures to death.
[02:05:34.710 --> 02:05:37.789]  So, That's the tactic they use.
[02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:38.869]  None of this is happening.
[02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:40.029]  Everything's fine.
[02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:43.470]  No, it's not.
[02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:47.750]  I'm sorry, we're surrounded by humongous right now.
[02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:57.649]  But if you actually look at our numbers, it's not an oil refinery with 80 people or 100 people in it in the movie with a couple hundred pirates.
[02:05:59.149 --> 02:06:03.069]  It'd be like a city of a million people against 200 pirates.
[02:06:03.850 --> 02:06:06.050]  That's about a good analogy of the numbers.
[02:06:09.829 --> 02:06:14.989]  And it's not like we're inside the city and all the ammunition is dried up, you know, 10 years after the collapse of civilization.
[02:06:15.329 --> 02:06:16.970]  No, we're armed to the teeth as well.
[02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:20.489]  And not just with guns, but with understanding and communications and money.
[02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:28.350]  But see, people still see a show like this as an oddity or a hobby or, oh, there's that guy.
[02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:30.189]  He has this world view.
[02:06:32.649 --> 02:06:45.930]  And there's all these other worldviews and all this entertainment and people just can't differentiate fact from fiction and what's really urgent and existential versus crap.
[02:06:46.989 --> 02:06:50.050]  So, hey, there's a bunch of movies about martial law and civil war.
[02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:51.149]  Oh, that's actually happening.
[02:06:51.630 --> 02:07:07.409]  It just kind of normalizes it because your subconscious and unconscious sees those movies and And then when you see the real thing, you've been made comfortable.
[02:07:07.529 --> 02:07:08.649]  I want to explain something in psychology.
[02:07:08.649 --> 02:07:11.069]  You can go read the actual different schools of psychology.
[02:07:11.069 --> 02:07:12.350]  They propose it different ways.
[02:07:12.930 --> 02:07:15.970]  And all schools of psychology are is ways of looking at human nature.
[02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:33.369]  But there's big studies on this, that before television, and before a lot of violence was shown on television, veterans and people that had seen a lot of violence After World War I, when some of the visuals came out and then World War II,
[02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:53.430]  veterans would get up and walk out of movies that had a bunch of violence in them, most of them, because they thought it made it cheap, it made it a joke, and it wasn't entertaining to them because they experienced violence with the smell and the pain and the buddies dying and the freezing cold.
[02:07:55.250 --> 02:08:00.930]  And so to them it wasn't entertaining because they were already programmed by the real world to not like it.
[02:08:03.029 --> 02:08:11.310]  Their synapses had been made more sensitive to violence because they'd actually been involved in it.
[02:08:12.699 --> 02:08:28.060]  Whereas in studies, if you take somebody and show them Saw movies and slasher movies, the statistics vary, but the average person by the age of 20 now, since the 60s, and it gets worse, has seen hundreds of thousands of simulated murders, torture,
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:36.539]  rape, death, everything, but you're sitting back eating popcorn, eating pizza, drinking beer, eating milk dugs, you start associating...
[02:08:39.449 --> 02:08:42.890]  A space alien that crashes thousands of years ago in the frozen Arctic.
[02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:45.529]  Antarctic.
[02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:54.550]  Thawing out, horribly eating and dissolving and killing the science research facility.
[02:08:56.239 --> 02:09:05.220]  And because you're 10 years old eating milk duds and having nachos and watching a creature suck people's blood out and implode their bodies, to you it's just entertainment.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:10.460]  So later in life, if you ever saw something horrible and violent, it's you're desensitized.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:26.380]  But if you showed some World War II veteran like my dad's dad, Jerry Jones, Who got, you know, highly decorated B-17 pilot, whole nine yards, went to North Africa, into Italy, and then into Germany after the collapse of Germany, you know, in years and years.
[02:09:26.739 --> 02:09:31.460]  You know, he did his missions, and then they put him on the ground as an officer, doing logistics.
[02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:36.699]  And he saw the starving people and the dead bodies everywhere, and all of it.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.279]  And...
[02:09:40.619 --> 02:09:41.840]  They would go see a movie.
[02:09:42.439 --> 02:09:45.600]  He liked to watch stuff like Dumbo and stuff, you happy, sweet.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:55.979]  They'd go see a movie, my dad said, and it would show a bunch of weirdness or a bunch of violence.
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:57.159]  I mean, he'd say, we're getting out of here.
[02:09:57.199 --> 02:09:58.579]  I'm not turning you into a crazy person.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.579]  And he'd say to my dad, no, no.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.479]  Now, violence isn't a joke.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.340]  And this is going to screw your head up.
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.180]  And he didn't have a psychology degree.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:23.159]  To him, somebody that saw a whole bunch of violence and saw his buddies blow up next to him in their aircraft and saw stuff he told my dad about the starvation in Italy and Germany and the piles of dead bodies and the starving children and just the hell of it and the typhus.
[02:10:24.239 --> 02:10:25.779]  See, then it's not entertainment.
[02:10:26.619 --> 02:10:28.380]  But that's the way it works.
[02:10:29.579 --> 02:10:38.020]  The general public in the West and all over the world now has seen so much violence and so much death simulated.
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:45.239]  Your brain sees that in a position where there's no real pain to you and no real threat.
[02:10:45.399 --> 02:10:50.939]  So when the real threat comes, you're not able to respond.
[02:10:51.819 --> 02:10:56.420]  And I use the analogy of in a big city where you've had generations of deer getting fed.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:57.399]  There's no coyotes.
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:58.180]  There's no pressure.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.359]  The deer just walk up to your house.
[02:11:00.479 --> 02:11:01.579]  They walk out in front of cars.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:02.859]  They have no survival instinct.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.079]  And it's the same thing with the domesticated population that's lived in freedom so long.
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:12.779]  People...
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:31.140]  Hear this, and even if they consciously go, yeah, this is really happening, they still can't subconsciously differentiate because you've seen thousands of rapes and hundreds of thousands of murders and death and people being tortured to death in the most graphic way.
[02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:45.529]  But I'll notice somebody that's a trauma surgeon, I know some, they don't like horror movies or violence because they get to see enough of the real thing and smell the blood and see the dying screaming children.
[02:11:47.569 --> 02:11:51.810]  Most of the cops I know that have been cops a long time, they're like, I don't really like horror movies.
[02:11:51.930 --> 02:11:52.970]  Yeah, military, I know.
[02:11:53.050 --> 02:11:54.329]  Yeah, I don't really like war movies.
[02:11:54.869 --> 02:11:58.289]  They don't want to talk about it because, see, it's real.
[02:11:59.770 --> 02:12:01.989]  There were consequences to seeing it.
[02:12:05.630 --> 02:12:14.229]  Kind of like the first time I ever got drunk when I was about 12, some of my older friends, like 14, 15, stole some of their dad's gin.
[02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:17.310]  I'll never forget, a big bottle of gin.
[02:12:17.369 --> 02:12:32.409]  So we go over to these girls' house, and they're like 15, 16, and the parents are out of town, and we all start drinking gin, and we get totally drunk, and I pass out and wake up four hours later in vomit on the floor,
[02:12:33.489 --> 02:12:34.390]  And then I go home.
[02:12:34.489 --> 02:12:35.229]  It's already like midnight.
[02:12:35.409 --> 02:12:36.010]  I get in big trouble.
[02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:36.590]  Where have you been?
[02:12:36.609 --> 02:12:36.989]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:37.090 --> 02:12:37.850]  I drank for the first time.
[02:12:37.909 --> 02:12:38.329]  It was terrible.
[02:12:38.789 --> 02:12:41.829]  For decades, if I smelled gin, I wanted to throw up.
[02:12:41.970 --> 02:12:45.310]  See, because the first time I took it, it hurt me.
[02:12:45.449 --> 02:12:46.050]  I got sick.
[02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:48.229]  My body went, whoa, no more of that.
[02:12:50.130 --> 02:13:06.149]  But see, with violence and porn and all this stuff, it desensitizes you slowly and So that in the real world, you no longer have the nerve endings of real experience that when a real threat comes to deal with it.
[02:13:07.449 --> 02:13:08.470]  Like a dodo bird.
[02:13:08.729 --> 02:13:10.550]  Never had any experience with any predators.
[02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:12.369]  The sailors show up on Galapagos Island.
[02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:14.050]  Within a year or whatever it was, they're all dead.
[02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:15.029]  Because they just walk right up.
[02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:16.130]  You whack one and kill it.
[02:13:16.329 --> 02:13:18.329]  Big old fat, bigger than a turkey, juicy meat.
[02:13:18.649 --> 02:13:20.569]  The next one walks over, you can kill it.
[02:13:21.069 --> 02:13:23.229]  And that's what the public's like.
[02:13:23.329 --> 02:13:37.609]  Now, I'll assure you, after all the hell that's coming in civilization and society, because we go in these cycles, The next generation won't be into all this evil crap anymore because they'll understand, because they just went through hell, what it means.
[02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:39.029]  The wages of sin are death.
[02:13:42.670 --> 02:13:44.369]  And there are so many examples of this.
[02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:48.949]  So before I go to your calls and get into all the news, I just wanted to say to everybody, that's why I'm so upset.
[02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:51.529]  I know how real this is.
[02:13:51.770 --> 02:13:54.029]  I know how urgent this is.
[02:13:56.550 --> 02:14:03.670]  And I guess as I grew up and saw some violent, crazy stuff, but also studied history and experienced it and just have my instincts, I guess, weren't somehow erased.
[02:14:03.850 --> 02:14:05.409]  So they got passed on to me.
[02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:12.489]  And we know genetics get passed down a few generations in instincts and they fade out if they're not activated.
[02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:16.409]  And that's Carl Jung and his hypothesis has been proven right with epigenetics now.
[02:14:16.789 --> 02:14:25.470]  But regardless, I'm trying to figure out how do I turn people's survival instincts on who've not experienced really bad stuff yet?
[02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:27.649]  So that you don't have to experience it.
[02:14:28.569 --> 02:14:32.409]  See, nuclear war is a real possibility.
[02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:35.170]  People have a normalcy bias that it can never happen.
[02:14:36.489 --> 02:14:44.569]  So many people get mugged for the first time or home invaded and they're so freaked out over that because they could never imagine it could happen because it hadn't happened yet.
[02:14:46.649 --> 02:14:53.010]  So what I'm trying to get at here to all of you is, and I know you're an audience of activists that get, it's why you're tuned in.
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:56.380]  But I'm mainly asking a question.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:02.680]  How do we get the general public that's starting to wake up some, but still, oh, we have a tyranny.
[02:15:02.819 --> 02:15:03.960]  Oh, they steal elections.
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:05.699]  Oh, they're coming after our kids.
[02:15:05.899 --> 02:15:07.119]  Oh, they give us poison shots.
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:08.399]  Okay, let's just move on.
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:13.479]  No, you can't take that like it's just something that happened.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:18.039]  You've got to engage it and say no, or they'll do it again and do it bigger.
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:21.520]  Our lives are in danger.
[02:15:25.699 --> 02:15:26.560]  Alright, I'm going to go to break.
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:27.359]  Come back with your calls.
[02:15:27.659 --> 02:15:29.439]  877-789-2539.

[02:15:31.779 --> 02:15:32.739]  877-789.
[02:15:33.239 --> 02:15:36.159]  Alex, we're only six days to the main election day.
[02:15:36.199 --> 02:15:36.760]  It's already begun.
[02:15:36.899 --> 02:15:37.720]  They're trying to steal it everywhere.
[02:15:38.359 --> 02:15:40.800]  I believe they're going to extend it out if they can.
[02:15:40.859 --> 02:15:42.739]  But if it's a big enough Trump victory, they won't be able to.
[02:15:43.859 --> 02:15:46.479]  And then they're going to try to kill him and they're going to try to have civil uprisings.
[02:15:46.619 --> 02:15:47.800]  And we've got to war game this.
[02:15:48.579 --> 02:15:51.460]  It's not pessimistic to be honest about the climate we're in.
[02:15:51.699 --> 02:15:53.920]  And again, I need your support.
[02:15:55.579 --> 02:15:56.500]  Amazing products.

[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:13.530]  We're taking first-time callers today on the election and just the crazy times we're in and The Feds, I just showed you, AP, Reuters, NBC News, imminently, Trump supporters are going to kill Democrats during the election.
[02:19:13.670 --> 02:19:17.709]  No proof, no evidence, other than the globalists are going to false flag and blame it on us.
[02:19:18.149 --> 02:19:20.450]  I told you this was coming, and here it is!
[02:19:22.170 --> 02:19:27.549]  And really the reason I'm so beyond angry is I'm trying to stop this.
[02:19:29.149 --> 02:19:34.069]  For my own self-preservation, And if I'm going to be safe, it means you need to be safe.
[02:19:34.209 --> 02:19:35.190]  You understand why I'm so pissed here?
[02:19:36.129 --> 02:19:50.209]  I mean, it'd be like if a giant asteroid was coming at the Earth and we knew it was going to hit in a year, and we 100% Air Force, Elon Musk, could put rockets in the air with robot-controlled missiles that could go blow it off course or blow it up, and we didn't do it.
[02:19:50.250 --> 02:19:57.049]  And it's getting closer, and now it's a month away, and they've got the weapons to take it out, and I'm just like, what the hell's your problem?!
[02:19:59.889 --> 02:20:04.110]  I'm just, this, again, this is not a simulation.
[02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:12.549]  This is not World of Warcraft or some video game like Call of Duty.
[02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:14.110]  This is real.
[02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:17.090]  And I'm not talking to the regular audience.
[02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.870]  I know you get that.
[02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:18.790]  I'm sorry I'm lecturing.
[02:20:19.389 --> 02:20:21.329]  I'm talking about the general public.
[02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:23.450]  Because...
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:32.479]  If people wake up to how bad it is, then we'll stop it.
[02:20:33.639 --> 02:20:42.139]  But people have this, again, built-in normalcy bias that they just can't recognize what's right in front of their face.
[02:20:42.379 --> 02:20:49.319]  Yeah, people can recognize there's a big corrupt group and they're pedophiles and they're frauds, but it's kind of like, okay, that's what they do.
[02:20:49.479 --> 02:20:49.920]  No.
[02:20:50.959 --> 02:20:53.440]  That thing only progresses like cancer.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:56.440]  It only gets worse, and it's getting worse by the second.
[02:20:58.069 --> 02:21:10.549]  You know, we have the advantage that this isn't 40 years ago, 50 years ago, when the old-timers saw it way far off and warned everybody, or 30 years ago when it was closer, but still, you know, not in focus.
[02:21:10.909 --> 02:21:17.010]  And in the last decade, it's in our face, now it's on our back, singing its fangs into us with poison shots and everything else.
[02:21:18.329 --> 02:21:22.969]  We got the vampire on our neck, and I'm just like, can we get this thing off of us?
[02:21:24.250 --> 02:21:25.309]  It's really simple.
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:37.260]  And again, everything the left does from the top to the bottom is a projection of what they're doing to us.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.979]  So they're all over the news.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.040]  Oh, we're gonna kill them.
[02:21:41.139 --> 02:21:42.159]  Oh, we're gonna put them in camps.
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:43.340]  Oh, we're gonna murder them.
[02:21:43.459 --> 02:21:44.860]  Oh, we're gonna kill the black people.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:45.680]  Oh, we're Hitler.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.079]  Oh, they're gonna ban biracial marriage.
[02:21:49.219 --> 02:21:50.420]  It's just horse manure.
[02:21:51.059 --> 02:21:52.579]  But those are the talking points.
[02:21:55.930 --> 02:22:14.069]  And then we have the low-level people, this went viral yesterday, issuing a manual, both on audio and video and a text manual, on what to do once Trump takes over because of the fascism and the tyranny and how they'll have to go underground and hide what they're doing.
[02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:17.770]  No, no, that's what you tried to do to us, to bully us into submission.
[02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:23.250]  And for a while you did bully people, but now people realize there's no end to what you'll demand.
[02:22:23.409 --> 02:22:28.250]  So people out of self-preservation are finally going, my God, we got to get these people off our ass.
[02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:35.649]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[02:22:37.139 --> 02:22:39.200]  Alright, worst case scenario, Trump gets re-elected.
[02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:40.659]  Here is the game plan if that happens.
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:45.260]  The general rule of thumb from now on is, will the MAGA heads use it to attack someone?
[02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:47.180]  If so, keep your mouth shut.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:50.100]  You no longer know that any of your trans friends are trans.
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:53.879]  You no longer know that any of your non-Christian friends are non-Christian.
[02:22:54.079 --> 02:22:58.420]  You no longer know that any of your friends, family, or neighbors are left-leaning at all.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:05.620]  Anyone that you don't know tries to talk about politics around you, you shut that shit down immediately because that is fishing for information and people they can report.
[02:23:05.909 --> 02:23:10.690]  Anyone who tries to instigate a protest or a riot, they are also fishing for people that they can report.
[02:23:10.930 --> 02:23:17.149]  Anyone you know who is an immigrant, you are now going to tell anyone who asks that they have been living in America their whole lives.
[02:23:17.170 --> 02:23:22.629]  Because if you are not among the people who need to flee for their own safety, you are part of the people who are helping them flee.
[02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:24.829]  You do not brag about the people you have helped.
[02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:26.930]  You do not tell others about the people you have helped.
[02:23:27.049 --> 02:23:32.909]  You keep your mouth shut about all of it on every single possible forum.
[02:23:33.129 --> 02:23:37.450]  Anyone asks you about politics, you reply, who has time to talk about politics?
[02:23:37.649 --> 02:23:38.909]  And nothing else.
[02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:43.569]  Someone asks you your opinion on global warming, you say, I don't talk about politics.
[02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:48.989]  Someone asks your opinion on wages and unionization, you say, I don't talk about politics.
[02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:55.049]  Someone asks about your opinion on the basic rights of other people, you say, I don't talk about politics.
[02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:57.850]  It's gonna hurt, but that's what's gonna help you and others survive.
[02:23:58.149 --> 02:24:08.149]  These are the basic ground rules for surviving a fascist government, which is 100% what Donald Trump has said on camera he wants to put in place if he gets re-elected.
[02:24:08.229 --> 02:24:10.629]  I am not trying to tell you that he is guaranteed to win.
[02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:14.250]  I am not going to tell you that he is going to successfully overthrow the government.
[02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:21.329]  I am telling you these are the things that are going to happen if he somehow does wind up back in the White House and what you need to do to prepare.
[02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:28.069]  And finally, you may not like it, but get yourself firearms training, firearm safety training, and stay strapped.
[02:24:28.129 --> 02:24:31.090]  Because worse comes to worse, you also need to be able to defend yourself.
[02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:35.969]  And the Second Amendment is probably the only constitutional right that Donald Trump will not do away with.
[02:24:36.209 --> 02:24:44.590]  Probably most importantly, if he does get elected and you talk about your personal politics anywhere on social media, you need to delete that account in its entirety immediately.
[02:24:44.670 --> 02:24:51.989]  There will still be archived evidence of it, but at the very least they can't go into a profile that you are still using and say that those are still your views.
[02:24:52.129 --> 02:24:55.450]  Which can be the difference between walking free and being in a camp.
[02:24:57.470 --> 02:24:59.110]  Walking free and being in a camp.
[02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:02.549]  So we've had Antifa running around beating up women in babies in strollers.
[02:25:02.649 --> 02:25:06.329]  We have new videos of people screaming at babies, saying they're going to get them.
[02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:08.930]  The Democrats, you've got all these Republicans put in jail.
[02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:10.250]  All the lawfare.
[02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:17.229]  You've got the leftist ideology arresting people that peacefully pray across the street from abortion clinics.
[02:25:18.149 --> 02:25:19.190]  I mean, look at this.
[02:25:19.709 --> 02:25:22.649]  Steve Bannon freed from prison after four months behind bars.
[02:25:25.350 --> 02:25:26.110]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:30.379]  So many examples of this.
[02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:34.959]  And then we've got Tommy Robinson.
[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:42.920]  Going back to a case over a decade ago where he exposed giant Muslim grooming gangs of kidnapped kids.
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:44.540]  It was all proven true.
[02:25:44.819 --> 02:25:48.420]  They put him through the court, tell him he's liable for it.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:52.040]  Then he secretly records everybody admitting that they rigged the case against him.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.739]  And they give him 18 months in a maximum security prison for it.
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.479]  Yeah, who's going to put who in camps?
[02:26:03.479 --> 02:26:10.059]  So, I could talk for hours, obviously, about the persecution and what they're doing.
[02:26:10.319 --> 02:26:13.079]  Listen to what that individual said.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:22.120]  He's repeating what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Carville and Axelrod and Jamie Raskin and all of them are saying.
[02:26:24.530 --> 02:26:25.969]  They're coming to kill you.
[02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:27.370]  You've got to get guns.
[02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:30.010]  And I know some of the biggest shooting range owners...
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:33.620]  And I go into those every few months.
[02:26:33.799 --> 02:26:35.940]  And I remember back when Trump first got elected.
[02:26:36.139 --> 02:26:41.979]  And then during the last election, they said, we see mainly liberals in here now buying guns and using them.
[02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:46.219]  They think they're going to have to kill Trump supporters because Trump supporters are coming to kill them.
[02:26:46.659 --> 02:26:50.799]  So see, they believe we're all coming to kill them while they're gearing up for war.
[02:26:50.979 --> 02:26:56.059]  And while their political leaders are saying they're going to have armed uprisings, because why?
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:27:00.479]  Donald Trump's coming to get the black men, James Carbell, last week.
[02:27:05.219 --> 02:27:05.659]  Kamala.
[02:27:05.659 --> 02:27:09.420]  He's coming with the military to kill citizens, to kill minorities.
[02:27:09.739 --> 02:27:10.680]  Two weeks ago.
[02:27:14.379 --> 02:27:15.879]  So they've set the table.
[02:27:16.379 --> 02:27:18.739]  They're like, oh my god, the minorities are waking up.
[02:27:18.819 --> 02:27:19.940]  They want prosperity and freedom.
[02:27:20.479 --> 02:27:22.100]  We'll just say the whites are going to kill them.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.239]  The Trumps are going to kill them.
[02:27:24.739 --> 02:27:25.959]  The MAGA is going to kill them.
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:27.639]  But then how do you make that real?
[02:27:27.979 --> 02:27:33.680]  You target the minorities, you kill them in mass, and you blame the Trump supporters.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:40.579]  And then you bring in martial law while he's president-elect or while the election is being fought over, which they've said they're going to do.
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:50.899]  And so it's my job to spotlight this ahead of it so that enough people understand how the cow ate the cabbage.
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:56.620]  Do I have to remind you again?
[02:27:58.319 --> 02:28:11.100]  Over a month ago, they signed an executive order, and whoever's running that administration, the coup, then the Pentagon releases a manual on urban operations, takeover of society for civil unrest, and killing U.S. citizens.
[02:28:13.659 --> 02:28:15.860]  And then I try to get Trump to talk about it.
[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:21.340]  I've gotten Musk to link to it, and we've gotten Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:28:21.379 --> 02:28:21.940]  to do it.
[02:28:22.239 --> 02:28:23.579]  So I got a direct line to him.
[02:28:24.719 --> 02:28:26.020]  And I'm just doing the best I can.
[02:28:29.579 --> 02:28:31.239]  So, we have the enemy blueprint.
[02:28:31.239 --> 02:28:32.280]  We know their attack.
[02:28:33.139 --> 02:28:34.319]  And I'm just sitting here.
[02:28:34.399 --> 02:28:36.079]  I don't know whether it'll be tonight, tomorrow, next week.
[02:28:38.319 --> 02:28:39.040]  Election night.
[02:28:39.239 --> 02:28:40.020]  I don't know.
[02:28:41.299 --> 02:28:43.200]  I don't know when the truck bomb's gonna go off.
[02:28:43.219 --> 02:28:44.520]  I don't know when the mass shooting's gonna happen.
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:48.479]  I just know that's the next step.
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:52.459]  And I'm just, you know, I'm the gloom and doomer.
[02:28:53.139 --> 02:28:54.540]  I'm the crazy man.
[02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:08.399]  That said they're going to release the virus out of China and use it for lockdowns and make you stand six feet apart and wear a mask and not go to the ballgames and they'll give you a global ID card, which they failed to get done, but they tried.
[02:29:10.329 --> 02:29:13.829]  And then it all happened, and people were like, how the hell does he know that?
[02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:15.069]  That's man's psychic.
[02:29:15.809 --> 02:29:20.270]  No, there were just literally hundreds of UN battle plans and disease acts to take over the world.
[02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:21.430]  It's in my film, Endgame.
[02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:22.770]  I made it in 2007.
[02:29:24.610 --> 02:29:27.149]  I mean, you know, it's just...
[02:29:27.149 --> 02:29:34.409]  You got all these UN heads saying they're going to use NATO and the UN during the next lockdown to arrest people that disagree with the lockdown?
[02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:45.219]  I mean, I've got all these incredibly interesting clips.
[02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:47.180]  I've got all this wild stuff to show you.
[02:29:47.219 --> 02:29:48.020]  It's all very entertaining.
[02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:48.840]  It's all very interesting.
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:56.399]  You know, I should have played it yesterday.
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:30:05.860]  You got the head of the Treasury Department gets up to talk about the economy strong and the seal of the Treasury Department falls down behind her.
[02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:07.360]  That's a no-man, isn't it?
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:08.559]  It's interesting.
[02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:12.489]  It's great radio and TV. Why didn't I cover it?
[02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:14.370]  Because I guess I've got a problem.
[02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:21.409]  I can't cover stuff that's a side issue when the big crisis is coming down.
[02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:23.850]  But I will.
[02:30:23.989 --> 02:30:24.069]  Here.
[02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:26.270]  This is what any other talk show host would play.
[02:30:27.610 --> 02:30:28.709]  So here, I'll do it.
[02:30:29.370 --> 02:30:31.049]  Why don't you buy Infowars?
[02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:33.309]  Trump nods when rally-goers ask...
[02:30:34.219 --> 02:30:35.840]  Trump to purchase Alex Jones' platform.
[02:30:36.659 --> 02:30:43.260]  I'm glad the listeners are a little concerned that the feds have maneuvered us into the position to liquidate Infowars on the 13th and shut it down.
[02:30:44.319 --> 02:30:54.959]  And they're trying, they have filed in court to take my name and say I can't even use my name and take me off anywhere I am and raise money off my name for their causes.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:56.319]  They want to steal my identity.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:57.399]  Kind of a big deal.
[02:30:58.319 --> 02:31:02.639]  And it's not a big deal for me, it's a big deal for all of you that that's how crazy these people are.
[02:31:05.569 --> 02:31:06.690]  But that's where we are.
[02:31:06.850 --> 02:31:08.649]  That's a bellwether.
[02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:09.629]  That's a sign.
[02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:10.889]  That's a canary in the coal mine.
[02:31:10.989 --> 02:31:14.770]  That's a blinking red light of where we are.
[02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:20.950]  But quite frankly, that's a symptom of the disease as well, of tyranny.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:27.420]  That's something for people to go, oh, we know that's going on.
[02:31:27.559 --> 02:31:29.680]  We better share these reports and videos more.
[02:31:29.879 --> 02:31:32.340]  The system really doesn't like what he's doing because he's over the target.
[02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:39.760]  Oh, we might want to actually go to thealexshonestore.com or dr2sandals.com and get incredible products and stand with people that have courage.
[02:31:39.819 --> 02:31:41.159]  Because it's not just about me.
[02:31:41.319 --> 02:31:45.159]  If you don't stand with people that'll fight the globalist effectively with the truth...
[02:31:47.129 --> 02:31:55.930]  And if we were a fighter plane in World War II and had all the stickers for how many things we'd shot down, the whole damn fuselage is covered with our victories.
[02:31:56.829 --> 02:32:01.690]  If you won't bet on the winners, you've not bet on yourself.
[02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:04.510]  And this is bigger than you supporting Infowars.
[02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:11.889]  It's bigger than you supporting whatever we have to do after this and the support we need right now that we are getting there, but we're not there yet.
[02:32:15.549 --> 02:32:21.489]  What will it cost you for not taking action in any way you can legally and lawfully now?
[02:32:22.069 --> 02:32:29.649]  Because if America and the people and the populace of the world really flexed their muscles, it'd be game over for the globalists.
[02:32:30.610 --> 02:32:31.350]  Game over.
[02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:42.510]  So we can like, oh look, Bill Maher said he supports free speech, but he supports the whole globalist agenda on top of that.
[02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:54.069]  Oh, look, The Daily Show host, you know, he came out and he defended, you know, the comic at Mass Square Garden.
[02:32:54.209 --> 02:32:56.409]  See, even the liberals know the left's out of control.
[02:32:57.190 --> 02:33:01.270]  It's all just window dressing.
[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:09.579]  Oh, look, Andrew Cuomo came out and said, you know, people are mad, the government's corrupt, and Trump's probably a good guy.
[02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:14.219]  That's because the public's awake, but only to a certain point.
[02:33:14.219 --> 02:33:16.540]  But all the followers are now jumping on.
[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:17.819]  Yes, that's our victory.
[02:33:18.059 --> 02:33:22.299]  Yes, we're winning, which is why the enemy is going to strike back.
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:33.420]  Which is why we have to look at what would they do to bring in the Civil War and the race war.
[02:33:33.579 --> 02:33:35.459]  Well, they'd kill a bunch of black people.
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:38.299]  And I've been saying for years, look for that to the election.
[02:33:40.899 --> 02:33:57.760]  Obama, that's who runs it, the O'Biden administration, in June of 2021, put out the new national security directive for the Homeland Security and the U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI that the number one threat in the world to American citizens was white supremacists.
[02:33:59.549 --> 02:34:01.190]  Which is almost a non-existent thing.
[02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:03.889]  Most of them are feds.
[02:34:04.329 --> 02:34:06.750]  And then they set, defined a white supremacist.
[02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.170]  Is anybody that questions elections?
[02:34:11.129 --> 02:34:12.989]  Anybody that questions open borders?
[02:34:13.329 --> 02:34:15.909]  Anybody that questions lockdowns, forced injections?
[02:34:16.270 --> 02:34:17.450]  Or the mainstream media?
[02:34:20.959 --> 02:34:22.040]  Well, that's a Trump rally.
[02:34:22.239 --> 02:34:22.360]  See?
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:23.540]  That's a definition.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:30.780]  They're not really a white supremacist, but it's a new definition where they bring in that legal power to attack those people.
[02:34:32.399 --> 02:34:34.319]  It's unconstitutional, but they're doing it.
[02:34:35.059 --> 02:34:40.739]  They've declared war on you because you're awake and you're getting more awake and you're waking up others.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:55.729]  And then they hype up everywhere that Trump supporters are going to disrupt the election and kill minorities and On the eve of the election, and they say the answer is armed uprising so the left can protect itself.
[02:34:57.729 --> 02:35:06.829]  So, white supremacist Trump supporters, feds, mercenaries, attack a large minority gathering, which is now the majority.
[02:35:09.649 --> 02:35:14.889]  Then the left activates all their squads of terrorists and hooligans to burn everything down.
[02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:33.469]  And they believe out of that comes a big enough crisis to stop Trump and then have the government that's still in control, even if he's president-elect, kill Trump, stage more events, and then go and arrest the opposition to the globalists.
[02:35:35.069 --> 02:35:40.729]  And then they think that will cement a permanent dictatorship where they'll still have elections, but they're ceremonial.
[02:35:40.850 --> 02:35:42.690]  And obviously you can wargame that out.
[02:35:43.739 --> 02:35:45.280]  A bunch of the states are going to block it.
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:47.319]  A bunch of people that are on the fence are going to come in to block it.
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.040]  It's going to cause an even faster awakening.
[02:35:49.239 --> 02:35:50.780]  And then that's going to be spectacular.
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:52.700]  And the globalists won't get a fake civil war.
[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:56.680]  They'll get a real one between the American people and the globalist occupiers.
[02:35:56.799 --> 02:35:59.959]  And then the globalists will release viruses and turn the power off.
[02:36:00.079 --> 02:36:03.059]  And then there'll be a huge war for sure.
[02:36:03.799 --> 02:36:05.780]  And I mean, just, it's horrible.
[02:36:06.719 --> 02:36:11.020]  And look, somebody's got to get up here and tell you like it is.
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:14.059]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls here in a minute.
[02:36:17.319 --> 02:36:19.860]  Go ahead and play the clip of Trump getting asked to be.
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:20.860]  He nods a couple times.
[02:36:21.579 --> 02:36:21.840]  Yeah.
[02:36:22.659 --> 02:36:23.059]  Whatever.
[02:36:23.819 --> 02:36:26.899]  And then go ahead and play Jon Stewart.
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:30.739]  And then I'll start taking your calls right through the next hour.
[02:36:32.659 --> 02:36:35.260]  But it's because we're winning things are so dangerous.
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:35.620]  That's good.
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:36.420]  We forced them out in the open.
[02:36:37.649 --> 02:36:40.969]  But then you have to understand, it's not just bed of roses we get Trump in there.
[02:36:41.049 --> 02:36:44.709]  They're going to continue all these other shenanigans that we need to start wargaming.
[02:36:44.969 --> 02:36:50.270]  But we'll get to that if he actually gets in on January 21st, 2025.
[02:36:51.690 --> 02:36:52.850]  But this is a war.
[02:36:52.969 --> 02:36:54.670]  This is long-term, baby.
[02:36:55.389 --> 02:36:58.270]  And the only way you end it quickly is a spiritual awakening.
[02:36:58.829 --> 02:36:59.469]  Here's a close.
[02:37:10.959 --> 02:37:11.760]  Is the alarms.
[02:37:12.059 --> 02:37:15.700]  The opening act, grabbing headlines for all the wrong reasons.
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:20.319]  A comedian who offered unfunny, racist, cringeworthy jokes.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:23.260]  Basically calling Puerto Ricans trash.
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:26.180]  The most repulsive racial jokes about Latinos.
[02:37:26.479 --> 02:37:28.200]  Disgusting and hateful.
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:30.340]  So incredibly crude.
[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:32.520]  Frankly, just too X-rated to play here.
[02:37:32.819 --> 02:37:35.739]  Extremely vile so-called jokes.
[02:37:37.149 --> 02:37:38.489]  Extremely vile so-called jokes.
[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:41.290]  She name-checked my comedy album from the 90s.
[02:37:45.569 --> 02:37:47.889]  Did I really?
[02:37:55.569 --> 02:37:57.750]  I don't know who's AI, me or that guy.
[02:38:00.489 --> 02:38:12.409]  Now, obviously, in retrospect, having a roast comedian come to a political rally a week before Election Day and roasting a key voting demographic, probably not the best decision by the campaign politically.
[02:38:12.450 --> 02:38:16.909]  But to be fair, the guy's really just doing what he does.
[02:38:17.329 --> 02:38:20.309]  I mean, here he is at the Tom Brady roast a few months ago.
[02:38:20.719 --> 02:38:23.159]  The great Jeff Ross, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:27.479]  Jeff is so Jewish, he only watches football for the coin toss.
[02:38:28.639 --> 02:38:32.340]  Gronk, you look like the Nazi that kept burning himself on the ovens.
[02:38:33.139 --> 02:38:37.799]  Kevin is so small that when his ancestors picked cotton, they called it deadlifting.
[02:38:39.659 --> 02:38:40.799]  Yes, yes, of course.
[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:42.159]  Terrible boo, yes.
[02:38:48.409 --> 02:38:49.750]  There's something wrong with me.
[02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:51.270]  I find that guy very funny.
[02:38:51.489 --> 02:38:52.709]  So, I'm sorry.
[02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:54.409]  I don't know what to tell you.
[02:38:55.350 --> 02:38:58.430]  I mean, bringing him to a rally and have him not do roast jokes?
[02:38:58.430 --> 02:39:01.110]  That'd be like bringing Beyonce to a rally and not have...
[02:39:10.299 --> 02:39:11.159]  And I get it.
[02:39:11.219 --> 02:39:13.340]  Things are dark and Jon Stewart's writers are really funny.
[02:39:13.379 --> 02:39:14.200]  And that's all true.
[02:39:14.379 --> 02:39:16.139]  And I know Tony Hitchcliffe well.
[02:39:16.299 --> 02:39:17.760]  I've done a lot of his shows with him as a co-host.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:19.000]  Great guy here in Austin.
[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:29.120]  But the point is that you heard the news, so-called news, say it's too X-rated to air.
[02:39:30.379 --> 02:39:32.899]  That way you can just imagine what he did.
[02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:34.860]  Oh, he called Latinos garbage.
[02:39:38.149 --> 02:39:40.190]  And then they don't show you what he actually said.
[02:39:40.290 --> 02:39:41.670]  That's always a telltale sign.
[02:39:41.829 --> 02:39:47.469]  Like that clip I played 10 minutes ago, the left is going, and Trump says he's going to create fascism and arrest and kill everybody.
[02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:49.889]  He's on record saying it.
[02:39:49.989 --> 02:39:52.069]  Boy, you'd think you'd show that clip, right?
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:40:03.379]  I mean, I'd already shown Carmel eight or nine times, and Braskin 20 times or so, and Hillary and Kamala saying Trump's going to clarify with the military and kill the blacks dozens of times.
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:08.299]  So I didn't play it today because it's neurotic to do that, but at least I've got it on record.
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:12.840]  I mean, you can pull up anything I just said with their name on it, you'll get it in two seconds.
[02:40:13.420 --> 02:40:17.579]  You can't pull up Trump saying he's going to create a fascist system and arrest his...
[02:40:17.579 --> 02:40:20.159]  You can't pull him up saying Mexicans are criminals.
[02:40:20.379 --> 02:40:24.090]  You can't pull up Him saying the KKK are great people.
[02:40:24.250 --> 02:40:25.190]  It doesn't exist.
[02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:26.149]  It's a lie.
[02:40:27.930 --> 02:40:28.930]  It's a fraud.
[02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:38.969]  And of course, Tony Hinchcliffe will only get bigger because he's not apologizing.
[02:40:38.969 --> 02:40:46.309]  He's saying, if you don't like what I said to Kamala Harris and to Tim Walz, change your tampon.
[02:40:47.399 --> 02:40:49.559]  Might be time for you to change your tampon.
[02:40:49.659 --> 02:40:50.200]  Let me actually read it.
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:52.059]  These people have no sense of humor.
[02:40:53.459 --> 02:41:03.860]  Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his busy schedule, in quotes, to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist.
[02:41:04.059 --> 02:41:06.440]  I love Puerto Rico and vacation there.
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:08.520]  I made fun of everyone.
[02:41:09.020 --> 02:41:10.260]  Watch the whole set.
[02:41:10.479 --> 02:41:12.100]  I'm a comedian, Tim.
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:14.700]  Might be time to change your tampon.
[02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:18.370]  Oh my God.
[02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:22.530]  But the takeaway from this is do not apologize.
[02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:24.989]  And the Trump campaign apologized.
[02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:26.370]  They shouldn't have done that.
[02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:34.829]  We're bullied by the globalists, telling us we're bad, telling us what we can say, what we can do, always lying about it.
[02:41:35.229 --> 02:41:38.229]  Stop letting them be in charge of your mind.
[02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:43.409]  And that starts with backing the people they hate the most.
[02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:44.350]  Alex Jones.
[02:41:46.159 --> 02:41:54.319]  Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, the people that have proven they won't back down.
[02:41:54.459 --> 02:41:58.479]  And I'm not Donald Trump or Elon Musk where I have hundreds of billions of dollars laying around.
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:00.879]  I want to stay in the fight.
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:02.819]  And it's critical.
[02:42:02.819 --> 02:42:03.860]  And it's so simple.
[02:42:03.959 --> 02:42:05.180]  I want to thank those that have been supporting.
[02:42:05.319 --> 02:42:05.940]  You know who you are.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:12.440]  But, I mean, my gosh, we've been reaching, let's not exaggerate, 20 extra million people a day lately.
[02:42:14.409 --> 02:42:22.629]  And I know the economy must be shot because, you know, six, seven, eight years ago, when Trump said his heyday, audience goes up, funds go up, we get to expand.
[02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:24.129]  Instead, audience explodes.
[02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:27.110]  Extra money doesn't come in because the economy's screwed.
[02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:28.870]  I don't care what Kamala says.
[02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.309]  I know.
[02:42:29.370 --> 02:42:32.489]  I talk to my family and relatives around the state and around the country.
[02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:34.190]  They got degrees.
[02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:35.110]  They got multiple jobs.
[02:42:35.250 --> 02:42:36.090]  They don't have extra money.
[02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.670]  I get it.
[02:42:36.969 --> 02:42:40.290]  But you need to support organizations that are the best.
[02:42:40.430 --> 02:42:43.010]  You've got to strategically support, plus they're great products.
[02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:45.649]  T-shirts, supplements, all of it.

[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:14.879]  And we've got some of the best shirt designs out there you're gonna find.

[02:44:28.700 --> 02:44:34.079]  If you want to meet like-minded people and trigger tyrants, the I Love Alex Jones shirt will surely do it.
[02:44:34.299 --> 02:44:35.500]  Hurrah, stupid Americans!
[02:44:35.799 --> 02:44:37.520]  So I want to thank you all for your past support.
[02:44:37.739 --> 02:44:40.819]  Now is the most critical time in our history to support the transmission.
[02:44:41.079 --> 02:44:42.379]  I cannot do it without you.
[02:44:42.479 --> 02:44:43.280]  You are the resistance.
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:44.280]  You are the Infowar.
[02:44:44.559 --> 02:44:56.600]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and check out these amazing designs and ensure that my fight and my cruise fight against the New World Order as the Great Awakening explodes continues on.
[02:44:56.819 --> 02:44:59.200]  The Globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:01.020]  I'm counting on you taking action.
[02:45:01.239 --> 02:45:06.219]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and continue to keep the tip of the spear on air.
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:06.680]  Thank you.
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:16.059]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health.
[02:45:16.159 --> 02:45:21.879]  Not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[02:45:21.959 --> 02:45:22.819]  It's just all around us.
[02:45:23.219 --> 02:45:26.159]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:26.760]  Bill Gates.
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:35.040]  It is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:35.860]  It's insane.
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:42.260]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:53.079]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:56.389]  Now, These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[02:45:56.629 --> 02:45:59.290]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:03.489]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:05.489]  This is amazing.
[02:46:05.489 --> 02:46:06.850]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[02:46:07.649 --> 02:46:14.389]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[02:46:15.219 --> 02:46:16.219]  Pro-prostate.
[02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:27.020]  Because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the saw palmetto.
[02:46:27.159 --> 02:46:33.459]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, saw palmetto is insane.
[02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:33.920]  Look it up.
[02:46:34.079 --> 02:46:36.420]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[02:46:36.659 --> 02:46:38.639]  It's got the trifecta going.
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:47.639]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but You can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:52.659]  And you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[02:46:52.799 --> 02:47:02.040]  Or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:47:02.159 --> 02:47:04.020]  And it's going to keep the broadcast on the air.
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:04.879]  That's a win-win.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:05.700]  Please take action.
[02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:12.129]  For six days from the official election day, Democrats have promised to string out as long as possible.
[02:47:12.450 --> 02:47:16.590]  They're predicting Homeland Security that all these right-wingers are going to kill everybody.
[02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:18.610]  Obvious false flag preparation.
[02:47:18.930 --> 02:47:19.850]  What do we do about it?
[02:47:19.930 --> 02:47:22.989]  We're taking your phone calls for the entire hour that we're now into.
[02:47:23.729 --> 02:47:30.229]  We're going to go to Tom, John, Darcy, Michael, Paul, Josh, Matthew, the Destroyer, Scott, Mike, and Sean.
[02:47:30.690 --> 02:47:32.290]  Tom in the UK, you're up front.
[02:47:32.430 --> 02:47:32.750]  Go ahead.
[02:47:33.690 --> 02:47:34.549]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:35.129]  Can you hear me?
[02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:35.629]  I can't.
[02:47:35.649 --> 02:47:35.889]  Go ahead.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.559]  First of all, thank you very much for hearing me.
[02:47:41.379 --> 02:47:43.440]  I've not been listening for that long, really.
[02:47:44.399 --> 02:47:47.000]  The reason I woke up was kind of a spiritual thing.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.360]  I had a really bad accident.
[02:47:48.719 --> 02:47:51.840]  And what happened was I questioned my existence.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:53.299]  I said, you know, why am I here?
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:59.860]  And then I looked down, you know, loads and loads of rabbit holes and started listening to you.
[02:47:59.979 --> 02:48:05.159]  And I listened to you every night from the UK, literally every night without, you know, without taking a breath.
[02:48:06.250 --> 02:48:09.649]  And where I'm at now in the UK, it scares me.
[02:48:09.889 --> 02:48:13.329]  I have two children, young, eight and three years old.
[02:48:14.129 --> 02:48:21.069]  And as a white Christian person, I just feel like we're being erased.
[02:48:22.090 --> 02:48:23.829]  I think a lot of it is apathy.
[02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:31.209]  People just don't want to believe what's going on around the, you know, in front of their own faces.
[02:48:31.489 --> 02:48:34.629]  And it truly scares me and it's isolated me from my family.
[02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:39.469]  My friends have called me crazy, conspiracy theorist, blah, blah, blah.
[02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:45.209]  And I just don't know where to go to kind of wake people up.
[02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:50.049]  I share the clips, you know, stuff in front of our eyes, geoengineering.
[02:48:50.370 --> 02:48:56.809]  Well, where do you live in the UK? Where do you live in the UK? In the northwest, a small town called Burnley.
[02:48:58.909 --> 02:49:01.350]  Well, geoengineering is a massive thing.
[02:49:02.049 --> 02:49:03.090]  It's happening every day.
[02:49:03.610 --> 02:49:09.450]  And I post pictures and people that have eyes to see can see it.
[02:49:09.809 --> 02:49:12.069]  Well, I mean, look, I guarantee you...
[02:49:12.879 --> 02:49:27.120]  If you start a local group and start getting on the local message boards and things and talk about creating a freedom-based, pro-human research organization or something, or a local community freedom organization, you'll meet a lot of like-minded people.
[02:49:27.379 --> 02:49:31.379]  They have rallies all the time in London with hundreds of thousands of people coming out against the New World Order.
[02:49:32.159 --> 02:49:47.450]  There's a lot of people awake in the UK. Back when we could get the numbers out of the UK, I mean, we were like the number 40-something biggest website for listeners in the UK. So I know we have a lot of listeners in the UK. People are either totally asleep or waking up fast there.
[02:49:47.649 --> 02:49:48.469]  And look at Brexit.
[02:49:48.629 --> 02:49:49.170]  Look at it all.
[02:49:49.329 --> 02:49:50.510]  People are fighting hard.
[02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:53.170]  But I understand your frustration, brother.
[02:49:53.350 --> 02:49:54.370]  And this is part of the awakening.
[02:49:54.610 --> 02:49:56.290]  And God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:49:58.030 --> 02:50:00.229]  That really wasn't on the Trump election, but it's okay.
[02:50:01.069 --> 02:50:06.170]  The topic is the election and all the craziness and what's the deep state going to do?
[02:50:07.969 --> 02:50:09.270]  Let's go to Mike in New Jersey.
[02:50:09.430 --> 02:50:09.850]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:12.120]  Hey, Alex.
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:14.280]  It's a tremendous honor to speak to you.
[02:50:14.479 --> 02:50:15.299]  So, two things.
[02:50:15.799 --> 02:50:19.360]  First of all, I don't know if I was the only one, Dad.
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.520]  The first time I saw Tim Walz, something struck me off about him.
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:27.739]  I'm telling you, this guy is capable of great, great evil.
[02:50:27.879 --> 02:50:35.399]  And I don't think enough people are talking about it because he kind of comes off with this effeminate, harmless demeanor.
[02:50:35.540 --> 02:50:39.059]  But I really do not underestimate the great evil that man is capable of.
[02:50:39.879 --> 02:50:41.239]  Well, I mean, his actions.
[02:50:41.620 --> 02:50:44.399]  A communist Chinese spy, a congenital liar.
[02:50:45.399 --> 02:50:47.600]  He's pushing, you know, sterilizing our kids.
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:48.340]  He's a pervert.
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:49.139]  I mean, he's a sicko.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:49.879]  He's an agent of Satan.
[02:50:50.059 --> 02:50:51.100]  He gets his orders directly from the devil.
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:52.440]  He's a Satanist.
[02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:55.600]  I'm thoroughly inclined to agree.
[02:50:55.799 --> 02:51:11.430]  And, Alex, the other thing that I've really been dying to talk to you, and it's a tremendous honor, in other words, from the perspective of to get the word to the masses, Mass assembly, I think,
[02:51:11.530 --> 02:51:30.450]  would be necessary, but I get so concerned to initiate such gatherings in this day and age because we're dealing with nefarious forces that are capable of great evil, and I get nervous to bring so many people together with a common goal that is necessary.
[02:51:33.399 --> 02:51:36.540]  Well, that's a great point.
[02:51:36.739 --> 02:51:37.479]  I appreciate the call.
[02:51:37.659 --> 02:51:40.239]  We'll come back in 60 seconds and join a bunch of stations and give you my answer.
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:41.540]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:51:41.639 --> 02:51:42.000]  Stay with us.
[02:52:13.699 --> 02:52:14.379]  Frontier.
[02:52:14.379 --> 02:52:19.239]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[02:52:19.799 --> 02:52:21.159]  What do they look like?
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:22.200]  Ships?
[02:52:22.420 --> 02:52:23.100]  Motorcycles?
[02:52:24.379 --> 02:52:26.559]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[02:52:29.059 --> 02:52:32.360]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never seen.
[02:52:34.459 --> 02:52:40.000]  And then, one day, I got in.
[02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:58.610]  All right, I love taking phone calls because the callers will bring up angles and ideas that I meant to cover or I hadn't thought of.
[02:52:58.709 --> 02:53:08.090]  But the last caller, just to recap, if you just tuned in, said, look, mass organization, mass rallies, people coming together.
[02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:15.520]  Is the answer to the previous caller saying, I'm here in this small town in England, I feel all alone.
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:25.360]  And I said, you need to go out, you need to meet like-minded people, you need to go to anti-globalist rallies, even if you go to a town or a city near you, and then you'll find a lot of folks from your town who are at that rally.
[02:53:26.319 --> 02:53:31.200]  And even if you find five people in your small town, that's a genesis point to build off of.
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:32.500]  And I think you'll find a lot more than that.
[02:53:36.319 --> 02:53:38.420]  So, a caller asked...
[02:53:39.350 --> 02:53:40.530]  What about provocateurs?
[02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:46.090]  What about if we go have big rallies against the New World IDs and against the Cashless Society?
[02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:46.930]  And that's back in the news.
[02:53:47.010 --> 02:53:48.090]  I'll cover that after we take some calls.
[02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:50.209]  Big developments there.
[02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.909]  What do we do?
[02:53:52.049 --> 02:53:54.930]  Well, I mean, I went to J6. I've been on a bunch of other big Trump rallies.
[02:53:55.090 --> 02:53:56.969]  We'd had two of them before that in the months before.
[02:53:58.729 --> 02:54:00.129]  One of them had 300,000.
[02:54:00.149 --> 02:54:02.829]  Another had over half a million, the Park Police estimated.
[02:54:03.069 --> 02:54:03.549]  Our rallies.
[02:54:03.989 --> 02:54:04.770]  Half a million people.
[02:54:05.829 --> 02:54:07.510]  And then Trump saw that and people saw that.
[02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:09.309]  They said, Jones, please do another rally.
[02:54:10.090 --> 02:54:15.510]  And so we went and rented a big area for, you know, a hundred and something thousand dollars from the park.
[02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:17.290]  Cost money to do that.
[02:54:17.469 --> 02:54:21.610]  Raised money on January 5th, about a month before.
[02:54:22.270 --> 02:54:31.770]  And then the White House calls us as one way to talk to these fundraiser groups that pay for Trump's political rallies because government money doesn't pay for those because it's campaign money.
[02:54:31.930 --> 02:54:33.129]  But we want you to run it.
[02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:34.969]  And I instantly went...
[02:54:35.780 --> 02:54:38.239]  I'm not doing that, but I'll give you my ideas.
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:46.239]  So I handed it off, and Trump and them also had the fifth rented, so we had rallies there that night.
[02:54:47.159 --> 02:54:50.680]  And then I go to that, and there's the Ellipse, and only 30,000 can get into that.
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:57.260]  There's upwards of a million outside there, just covering all of that area of D.C., up the hill to the Washington Monument.
[02:54:58.069 --> 02:54:58.909]  And then share it up.
[02:54:59.010 --> 02:55:02.290]  Trump says, okay, now, in the middle of a speech, the march is going to start.
[02:55:02.350 --> 02:55:02.989]  I'll meet you there.
[02:55:03.149 --> 02:55:06.350]  We had a stage rented up by the Supreme Court in the corner of the Capitol.
[02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:11.670]  And cell phones weren't working good because there were a million people using them.
[02:55:11.729 --> 02:55:13.469]  But in the message I was getting, hey, there's violence.
[02:55:13.829 --> 02:55:15.969]  There's people in blacks attacking the cops.
[02:55:16.049 --> 02:55:17.010]  The cops using tear gas.
[02:55:17.149 --> 02:55:18.510]  So we jogged down there.
[02:55:19.969 --> 02:55:23.370]  There's people climbing the parapets and people falling off and police attacking people.
[02:55:23.469 --> 02:55:24.610]  I got hit in the face with tear gas.
[02:55:24.709 --> 02:55:25.729]  I'm 100 yards away.
[02:55:26.719 --> 02:55:28.639]  I said, we got to get up on this pile of chairs.
[02:55:29.139 --> 02:55:30.420]  They hadn't unpacked yet.
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:32.659]  They were all in bubble wrap, shrink wrap.
[02:55:32.739 --> 02:55:33.899]  And I said, you know, don't go in.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:34.680]  It's going to be Kin State.
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:35.459]  You're being set up.
[02:55:35.879 --> 02:55:37.079]  Looks like this is a setup.
[02:55:38.079 --> 02:55:39.260]  And sure enough, it was.
[02:55:40.739 --> 02:55:42.680]  And it didn't go horribly like the feds wanted.
[02:55:43.559 --> 02:55:46.459]  And of course, the million people there, 99% of them didn't participate.
[02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:48.899]  Most of the folks that got arrested got waved in.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.479]  Once they opened the doors, they didn't know what was happening.
[02:55:51.459 --> 02:55:56.739]  Because you're like backing a crowd of a couple hundred thousand that already got in the Capitol and you don't know what's going on.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:57.520]  It's the fog of war.
[02:55:58.559 --> 02:55:59.899]  And they're like, hey, they've opened the doors.
[02:55:59.899 --> 02:56:00.479]  We're going in.
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:03.860]  And I said to my crew, I said, we're not going in there.
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:05.139]  It's a set up.
[02:56:08.170 --> 02:56:13.569]  But you can't never have a rally again because the feds are going to try to set you up revocateurs.
[02:56:13.850 --> 02:56:19.950]  And notice, at first, they could demonize America and Trump, but very quickly it came out the feds were behind it.
[02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:22.270]  And now January 6th is something that exposes them.
[02:56:22.450 --> 02:56:29.989]  And the J6 fake committee with Liz Cheney and Raskin destroyed all the interviews with myself and others.
[02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.610]  I was under...
[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:32.280]  I took the fifth.
[02:56:32.479 --> 02:56:37.440]  I knew they'd charge me and put me in jail like Bannon, so I just got there and said, you're criminals, you lie.
[02:56:37.719 --> 02:56:45.540]  I take the fifth not out of self-incrimination, but out of the fact that you will lie about what I said and claim that I perjured myself, and so I'm not talking.
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:51.520]  And I said, I take the Fifth Amendment 98 times with Jamie Raskin asking the questions.
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:57.780]  And Adam Schiff and all of them and Liz Cheney staring at me like they wanted to kill me.
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.020]  And three or four of the times I said, you are criminals.
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:02.219]  This is all fake.
[02:57:02.299 --> 02:57:03.000]  This committee's not real.
[02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:03.579]  I take the fifth.
[02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:04.739]  You are criminals.
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:05.719]  This is fake.
[02:57:05.819 --> 02:57:06.379]  I take the fifth.
[02:57:06.459 --> 02:57:08.040]  Not because I'm a criminal, but because you're a criminal.
[02:57:08.659 --> 02:57:09.299]  Told them that to their face.
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:09.799]  You're a criminal.
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:12.780]  Of course, they destroyed the video of all that.
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:21.159]  They put out one photo of me testifying in Congress on a jumbotron above them because they wanted remote.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:29.790]  They had their big committee hearing with me on a big giant television and Like 1984, behind the dais, behind them.
[02:57:30.010 --> 02:57:31.209]  They had TVs in front of them.
[02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:32.729]  And I said, you are criminals.
[02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:35.069]  I will not answer the questions of criminals.
[02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:39.649]  Bannon just spent four months, and he had his right to do it.
[02:57:39.709 --> 02:57:43.170]  He had executive privileges.
[02:57:43.290 --> 02:57:44.989]  He worked at the White House, so they can't ask those questions.
[02:57:45.129 --> 02:57:48.250]  But the point is, is that I've been there.
[02:57:48.329 --> 02:57:48.850]  I've seen it.
[02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:54.489]  And so the next time we have a big rally or events, people know what they're looking for.
[02:57:55.010 --> 02:57:56.309]  This was a good exercise.
[02:57:56.309 --> 02:57:59.030]  I'm sad we got set up and it happened and walked into a trap.
[02:57:59.389 --> 02:58:01.530]  But now we've been through another war.
[02:58:01.690 --> 02:58:02.709]  Now we've learned more.
[02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:04.370]  Now we know more of their tricks.
[02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:07.729]  It's not like I'm just up here for 30 years behind a microphone.
[02:58:07.909 --> 02:58:09.350]  I've been all over the place.
[02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:11.069]  I've learned a lot.
[02:58:11.829 --> 02:58:13.110]  Mainly from my mistakes.
[02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:15.270]  And so...
[02:58:17.079 --> 02:58:19.959]  And I saw conservatives never want to go to rallies anymore because of that.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:21.879]  But now people have gotten over that fear.
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:26.319]  Well, some people were calling me a traitor that day.
[02:58:26.399 --> 02:58:28.059]  Not a lot, but I'm like, don't go in.
[02:58:28.159 --> 02:58:28.459]  It's a setup.
[02:58:28.579 --> 02:58:29.040]  Screw you.
[02:58:29.239 --> 02:58:30.040]  We're taking the country back.
[02:58:30.059 --> 02:58:31.000]  Alex, you're a pussy.
[02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:32.459]  I'm like, yeah, you're about to get set up.
[02:58:35.479 --> 02:58:37.940]  And that's where we are.
[02:58:38.459 --> 02:58:44.459]  And they're getting ready to stage stuff much bigger than J6. I don't know the permutation, exactly where they'll hit, but that's the next move.
[02:58:45.819 --> 02:58:48.579]  And that's why I'm like a parrot just saying, get ready for that.
[02:58:49.299 --> 02:58:55.040]  Because I'm trying to get enough heat on it, enough eyes on it, enough light on it, where they don't do that.
[02:58:56.440 --> 02:58:59.959]  And where whistleblowers inside the system expose it.
[02:59:00.239 --> 02:59:01.559]  And that's what they're really worried about.
[02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:03.760]  So yes, we are winning.
[02:59:03.899 --> 02:59:04.700]  Yes, we have the initiative.
[02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:05.719]  Yes, we've turned the tide.
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.579]  Yes, Trump's set to win in a landslide, but they'll mitigate it with fraud.
[02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:09.799]  They may be able to steal it.
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:12.420]  My gut tells me they can't because no one's going to buy it.
[02:59:13.079 --> 02:59:18.899]  But if they stage terror attacks and blame us, that'll be the new story to divert off of that, and they're crazy enough to try it.
[02:59:20.739 --> 02:59:24.500]  So I'm telling you what I think's going on, and I've got a pretty good record.
[02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:26.879]  It's actually insanely accurate.
[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:29.500]  And to me, it's so easy to see it.
[02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:30.180]  I mean, I thought...
[02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:31.329]  It's not hard.
[02:59:31.569 --> 02:59:36.670]  They're not on every TV program and every newspaper saying Trump supporters are going to kill black people and there's no evidence.
[02:59:36.709 --> 02:59:37.649]  People are like, that doesn't make sense.
[02:59:37.770 --> 02:59:38.750]  They're about to supply it.
[02:59:39.729 --> 02:59:41.909]  Think about Jussie Smollett times a million.
[02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:45.190]  He was a lone ranger out there.
[02:59:45.930 --> 02:59:46.649]  A cowboy.
[02:59:47.370 --> 02:59:48.729]  But they'll do it big.
[02:59:48.829 --> 02:59:49.610]  They'll try to do it right.
[02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:51.870]  But notice their Whitmer set up fake kidnapping.
[02:59:52.049 --> 02:59:52.850]  That blew up in their face.
[02:59:55.979 --> 03:00:00.860]  And bad things happened to the FBI agents that ran that, and not from us, from their own selves.
[03:00:03.399 --> 03:00:09.200]  They all just got destroyed because God is sick of this crap.
[03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:12.940]  So, yeah, God's moving.
[03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:15.620]  But God hates cowards.
[03:00:17.219 --> 03:00:24.520]  And if you won't speak up today, you'll sure as hell never fight tomorrow if it comes to that.
[03:00:26.639 --> 03:00:29.719]  Alright, let's go back to your calls, but I think I answered the man's question.
[03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:32.600]  Michael in Oregon, we're talking about the election.
[03:00:32.780 --> 03:00:33.459]  We're wargaming it.
[03:00:33.559 --> 03:00:34.340]  Michael, you're on the air.
[03:00:34.459 --> 03:00:34.719]  Go ahead.
[03:00:36.379 --> 03:00:37.920]  Yeah, it's the worst of times.
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:39.200]  It's the best of times.
[03:00:39.399 --> 03:00:45.200]  You know, the creatures from the left lagoon are going to come out of every sewer drain, every place they got hiding.
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:48.139]  And, you know, this is not going to be fun.
[03:00:48.239 --> 03:00:52.459]  This is going to get really bad, in my opinion, in my eyes.
[03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:54.079]  I even had vivid dreams about this.
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:56.000]  You know, we're going to have to fight these people.
[03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:57.399]  They're broken minds.
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:00:59.139]  They're out of control.
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:05.000]  I've had people from my neighbors banging on my door, you know, having mental breakdowns telling me they know I'm a Trump supporter.
[03:01:05.239 --> 03:01:06.659]  They know what I voted for.
[03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:13.799]  You know, I live out in Portland where I feel like it's like the land of 300 out here.
[03:01:14.319 --> 03:01:17.280]  And it's a few of us and a lot of them.
[03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:19.920]  And it's going to get crazy.
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:32.670]  And I just feel like I need to go relocate, get to somewhere where I can actually be around like-minded people where I don't I feel like I'm about to walk into an army of, you know, from Antifa to everything else.
[03:01:32.790 --> 03:01:34.209]  They're just causing mayhem around here.
[03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:39.969]  The burning of the mailbox, voting, and all that stuff, that's just the beginning.
[03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:41.290]  This is priming the pump.
[03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:46.489]  This next day is all the way to January going to be the most dangerous days we've got alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:46.489 --> 03:01:47.629]  We need to stay vigilant.
[03:01:48.129 --> 03:01:50.430]  Ready and just be ready for anything.
[03:01:50.549 --> 03:01:56.610]  I'm telling you, they're getting ready to push the envelope to the extreme of all extremes.
[03:01:58.930 --> 03:01:59.430]  I agree.
[03:01:59.670 --> 03:02:00.850]  I use the analogy all the time.
[03:02:00.969 --> 03:02:01.670]  This is the best one.
[03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:07.190]  Episode 4, Star Wars, where the X-Wings are going in, in attack position, into the Death Star.
[03:02:08.569 --> 03:02:11.250]  And look at the size of that thing.
[03:02:11.370 --> 03:02:12.049]  Just cut the chatter.
[03:02:12.510 --> 03:02:13.850]  Accelerate to attack speed.
[03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:17.049]  But instead of people going, oh my God, look how dangerous that is.
[03:02:17.069 --> 03:02:19.889]  A lot of conservatives are kind of like, oh, we're invincible.
[03:02:20.170 --> 03:02:21.030]  Woo, it's a party.
[03:02:21.209 --> 03:02:23.010]  Let's go to Mar-a-Lago and wear tuxedos.
[03:02:23.229 --> 03:02:25.350]  And I'm like, we're assaulting the Death Star.
[03:02:25.629 --> 03:02:27.950]  I mean, this is serious stuff, folks.
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:36.780]  And for everybody else out there, the reason is a perfect analogy, those of us out there fighting in the X-Wings, you're like, well, thank God you're out there with the X-Wings.
[03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:41.920]  No, the Death Star is orbiting the planet to blow up the main base at the moon.
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:43.979]  They're coming after everybody.
[03:02:44.159 --> 03:02:50.360]  Yeah, we're out there trying to stop it, but our deaths, if we fail, are only five minutes before yours.
[03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:53.899]  That's a political analogy, but I mean, that's it.
[03:02:54.769 --> 03:02:57.389]  And guys, I'll play only the first minute of it.
[03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:58.209]  It's on YouTube.
[03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.829]  Just type in something.
[03:02:58.989 --> 03:03:01.610]  I think it'll probably be something like Death Star Assault.
[03:03:02.370 --> 03:03:03.649]  Something like that will bring it up.
[03:03:04.250 --> 03:03:05.870]  And that's it.
[03:03:06.010 --> 03:03:08.969]  And I'm just sitting here trying to be able to realize you're in a war.
[03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:12.950]  I mean, this is a globalist coup already in place that wants to stay in power.
[03:03:13.170 --> 03:03:16.430]  Just like Dana White said two weeks ago, there's already a coup.
[03:03:17.399 --> 03:03:20.280]  So everybody needs to understand, we're already under a deep state coup.
[03:03:20.399 --> 03:03:21.700]  They already hate us.
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:22.940]  They're already waging war with us.
[03:03:23.059 --> 03:03:24.459]  They want us poor to control us.
[03:03:24.559 --> 03:03:25.620]  They're absolutely evil.
[03:03:25.719 --> 03:03:29.840]  They're starting World War III. And people say, God, this is scary.
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:32.420]  Alex, there's another school of thought.
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:34.100]  Just be positive and say we're inventing.
[03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:35.159]  No, we are winning.
[03:03:37.019 --> 03:03:41.159]  Because we've admitted what's going on partially, but you've got to admit it all.
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:43.319]  And let me ask this question, Michael.
[03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:46.979]  I say it every two minutes because it's so precious to be talking to millions of people.
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:49.659]  Do you agree with me that they're all over the news?
[03:03:50.100 --> 03:03:51.399]  Obviously, you agree with that.
[03:03:52.059 --> 03:04:01.520]  It's private facial, but they're all over the news saying Trump supporters are about to blow everybody up and kill everybody with no evidence because the deep state's getting ready to stage something.
[03:04:01.639 --> 03:04:02.399]  I mean, isn't that obvious?
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.559]  1,000%.
[03:04:05.559 --> 03:04:10.459]  This is exactly how they do every false flag from when they did 9-11 to everything else.
[03:04:10.819 --> 03:04:21.020]  They used this to just prime every idiot pomp out there to hopefully get one of these losers to jump shit for them and get this thing started early.
[03:04:21.219 --> 03:04:29.479]  But other than that, if they can't get one started early, you better assure yourself they'll have something in the background that's plan B. Because from...
[03:04:29.959 --> 03:04:36.700]  Everything that is right there in the horizon, everything you can see right in front of you, it's like a mirage coming right at you.
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:38.040]  You know it's coming.
[03:04:38.299 --> 03:04:40.139]  It's just right out there in front of you.
[03:04:40.579 --> 03:04:42.600]  These people are never going to stop.
[03:04:43.139 --> 03:04:52.680]  Everybody needs to know that just because we've won a couple of rallies and we got them on the run, the empire is going to strike back and we need to be ready for anything.
[03:04:52.780 --> 03:04:53.579]  And I mean anything.
[03:04:53.639 --> 03:04:58.200]  These people are the most desperate, degenerate pieces of trash of all time.
[03:04:59.530 --> 03:05:01.270]  And they're going to try anything.
[03:05:01.270 --> 03:05:02.329]  They've already done everything.
[03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:03.989]  They're going to continue to do more.
[03:05:04.250 --> 03:05:06.430]  So that's it, Alex.
[03:05:09.350 --> 03:05:09.850]  Absolutely.
[03:05:11.229 --> 03:05:13.889]  And I just don't see if they staged terror attacks.
[03:05:14.850 --> 03:05:15.930]  Which are obviously imminent.
[03:05:16.129 --> 03:05:19.209]  They're saying we are imminently going to kill people as Trump supporters.
[03:05:19.629 --> 03:05:21.409]  And then there'll be articles today.
[03:05:21.729 --> 03:05:22.389]  There are every day.
[03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:26.350]  Jones is crazy claiming the government's going to stage terror attacks.
[03:05:27.870 --> 03:05:30.290]  They're saying we're going to stage terror attacks.
[03:05:30.370 --> 03:05:33.129]  And I'm saying you're the ones with the motives that have been caught doing it before.
[03:05:33.370 --> 03:05:35.829]  And the ones that are hyping it, you're obviously the ones.
[03:05:35.930 --> 03:05:37.709]  I mean, that is a no-brainer.
[03:05:38.069 --> 03:05:40.670]  Why the hell would we go kill black people?
[03:05:41.090 --> 03:05:43.049]  I mean, give me a break!
[03:05:44.600 --> 03:05:45.180]  Thank you, Michael.
[03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:49.379]  The destroyer in West Virginia.
[03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:49.920]  You're on the air.
[03:05:50.020 --> 03:05:50.299]  Go ahead.
[03:05:51.659 --> 03:05:52.659]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:53.059 --> 03:05:55.399]  Yeah, I definitely feel your frustration, brother.
[03:05:55.780 --> 03:06:01.379]  And honestly, in all reality, we definitely have been handed over to our enemies.
[03:06:01.379 --> 03:06:04.959]  And I feel like we're definitely going into another period of bondage.
[03:06:05.180 --> 03:06:08.000]  However, this will be a good thing.
[03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:10.319]  There are great people out there.
[03:06:10.899 --> 03:06:12.600]  And I definitely see...
[03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:17.340]  A huge awakening happened thanks to your work and God putting that through you.
[03:06:17.559 --> 03:06:20.659]  But everybody is still living too comfortable.
[03:06:20.799 --> 03:06:28.239]  And I just don't see all of this hard work that the enemies that be have put into play thus far to destroy America.
[03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:36.799]  I do not see it being handed over so easily to a Trump administration to try to correct or fix what has already been done.
[03:06:37.260 --> 03:06:47.530]  And can you imagine what would happen if All of the Trump supporters and Trump, you know, declared, you know what?
[03:06:47.530 --> 03:06:50.010]  We are not going to participate in this election.
[03:06:50.149 --> 03:06:55.149]  If we just all just did not participate in it, that would send shockwaves.
[03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:56.790]  I don't know.
[03:06:56.850 --> 03:06:57.229]  I don't know.
[03:06:57.290 --> 03:07:02.430]  They would just not cover that and say, oh, see, I get your point, but I believe the opposite.
[03:07:02.829 --> 03:07:06.690]  You participate because that overrides the baked-in fraud and people experience it.
[03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:09.069]  Look how much the fraud's out in the open now compared to four years ago.
[03:07:09.170 --> 03:07:11.149]  I mean, look, even if they steal this and kill Trump...
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:15.100]  It gets way worse for them, and they know that.
[03:07:15.260 --> 03:07:17.139]  That's why they're going to release another pandemic.
[03:07:18.260 --> 03:07:18.700]  Guaranteed.
[03:07:19.180 --> 03:07:19.620]  100%.
[03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:20.860]  They got it all set up.
[03:07:20.959 --> 03:07:21.600]  All the signs are there.
[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:24.079]  Totally agree.
[03:07:24.340 --> 03:07:25.340]  And I see that.
[03:07:25.440 --> 03:07:26.500]  I see that side, too.
[03:07:26.639 --> 03:07:29.520]  But we are walking into a rigged game.
[03:07:29.639 --> 03:07:35.040]  I mean, you have put through so many article after article after article showing all the fraud.
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:40.659]  We didn't learn in 2022 in the midterms, and we're still playing their rigged game.
[03:07:41.010 --> 03:07:45.409]  And I just don't see them giving it up that easily.
[03:07:45.829 --> 03:07:47.030]  Yeah, but let me explain this.
[03:07:47.350 --> 03:07:51.309]  There was almost no preparation or attempts to block fraud in 2020.
[03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:53.010]  There was some in 2022.
[03:07:53.290 --> 03:07:59.770]  There's a big fight now, and we force all these federal judges to say illegals can vote?
[03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:01.350]  Openly?
[03:08:01.489 --> 03:08:03.530]  I mean, we force them...
[03:08:04.559 --> 03:08:06.780]  To leave all these non-voters on the rolls?
[03:08:07.079 --> 03:08:13.000]  We force them to say they're going to count votes three days after the polls close with no postage mark?
[03:08:13.139 --> 03:08:20.879]  I mean, look, this isn't like a rigged game where it's a man in women's sports, the women just go home, and that's a great way.
[03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:24.360]  Any men are in women's sports, the women don't show up, the games are canceled, it's over.
[03:08:25.079 --> 03:08:27.680]  That's a great way in that tactic to boycott it.
[03:08:27.719 --> 03:08:28.340]  I totally agree.
[03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:36.219]  But when you've got fraud of this magnitude, you participate to show it and you don't give up and go home with your ball.
[03:08:36.340 --> 03:08:37.200]  But I hear your points.
[03:08:37.379 --> 03:08:38.020]  Great points.
[03:08:38.979 --> 03:08:40.000]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[03:08:40.459 --> 03:08:41.719]  I respect your opinion.
[03:08:42.639 --> 03:08:43.780]  Darcy in Virginia.
[03:08:43.940 --> 03:08:45.520]  Darcy, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:08:47.020 --> 03:08:47.860]  Hi, Alex.
[03:08:47.979 --> 03:08:49.540]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:09:06.280]  I just wanted to talk to the fact that even when I try and talk to people within my own family and be my extended family, my I'm very thankful that my parents were patriots and instilled very important values to never fully trust the government,
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:11.299]  which I feel like is just not even a common value anymore, at least not taught to children.
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:14.879]  But, you know, my younger brother, he's 21.
[03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:18.139]  He's in the Air Force right now.
[03:09:18.139 --> 03:09:26.940]  And I'm talking to my great aunt and my dad's cousin, and they're just not understanding with this young man looking right at them.
[03:09:27.270 --> 03:09:28.610]  That he could die.
[03:09:28.850 --> 03:09:29.750]  I could die.
[03:09:29.909 --> 03:09:31.110]  I'm a 24-year-old woman.
[03:09:31.290 --> 03:09:33.930]  I'm likely to be drafted if something were to go wrong.
[03:09:34.329 --> 03:09:37.329]  And when I explain to them, I'm a paralegal.
[03:09:37.329 --> 03:09:41.049]  I work at a top firm, and I can't afford to barely pay rent.
[03:09:41.049 --> 03:09:50.370]  I have to live around people who are screaming at me or mentally ill, all because I can't afford to pay rent as somebody who has a salary job with benefits.
[03:09:50.370 --> 03:09:51.090]  It's ridiculous.
[03:09:51.510 --> 03:10:01.719]  But, you know, I really am hopeful That a lot of people who aren't completely diluted are understanding that this is way more than identity politics.
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:03.840]  It's about not being able to feed yourself.
[03:10:04.079 --> 03:10:06.760]  It's about your own safety walking down the street.
[03:10:06.899 --> 03:10:08.819]  And I hope that more people understand that.
[03:10:08.940 --> 03:10:09.680]  I've seen it myself.
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:13.139]  But, you know, I really don't know what to expect.
[03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:17.719]  And I wouldn't be surprised if, like you said, the terrorist attacks, the false flags.
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:22.020]  I wouldn't be shocked if they were to sacrifice one of their own.
[03:10:22.159 --> 03:10:27.329]  If they were to Get rid of Kamala Harris right when Trump is elected and say that Trump supporters killed her.
[03:10:27.409 --> 03:10:28.030]  I wouldn't be shocked.
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:31.440]  Absolutely.
[03:10:31.440 --> 03:10:33.180]  They pre-programmed all of that.
[03:10:33.299 --> 03:10:34.440]  Or they could kill Biden.
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:37.040]  And, you know, just days before.
[03:10:37.159 --> 03:10:37.920]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[03:10:38.120 --> 03:10:40.239]  And then say, oh, look, she's the first female president.
[03:10:40.819 --> 03:10:46.459]  Anything is possible unless the globalists think we're aware of them and they won't get away with it.
[03:10:46.459 --> 03:10:47.760]  They are so upset about the show.
[03:10:47.879 --> 03:10:52.899]  Documents come out in Congress, CIA, FBI. They go, Jones continues to frustrate our plans.
[03:10:53.200 --> 03:10:54.520]  And that's not about me.
[03:10:54.819 --> 03:10:58.860]  I'm just trying to explain why the globalists are so pissed because we're not naive.
[03:10:58.860 --> 03:10:59.860]  We know their game plan.
[03:10:59.959 --> 03:11:00.600]  We know their tricks.
[03:11:05.039 --> 03:11:05.479]  Absolutely.
[03:11:05.479 --> 03:11:07.180]  Alright, anything else you'd like to add?
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:10.739]  Thank you for all the work you've done.
[03:11:10.899 --> 03:11:16.440]  I'd like to say that the first time I ever tuned into your show was, it happened to be the 30th anniversary.
[03:11:16.959 --> 03:11:26.799]  And you know, I'm ashamed to admit that I was once somebody who was completely brainwashed to think that you were a crazy person and all it took was one show and I haven't stopped watching since.
[03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:28.500]  So thank you for waking me up.
[03:11:28.819 --> 03:11:34.020]  Thank you for Saying all the things that we all should be saying but are too afraid to say.
[03:11:34.180 --> 03:11:34.700]  So thank you.
[03:11:34.899 --> 03:11:35.360]  Thank you.
[03:11:35.840 --> 03:11:36.360]  God bless you.
[03:11:36.459 --> 03:11:36.940]  We're in this together.
[03:11:37.159 --> 03:11:41.399]  Look, since she brought up the draft of women, that's the universal Democrat support.
[03:11:41.639 --> 03:11:42.780]  We'll show you your documents in a moment.
[03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:44.959]  They have news clips in the piece.
[03:11:45.399 --> 03:11:46.100]  We'll go to break.
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:46.379]  Come back.
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:47.079]  Go back to your calls.
[03:11:48.399 --> 03:11:52.280]  That's what class warfare and communism is all about is, oh, you'll get all this free stuff.
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:55.200]  Oh, well, the communists took over, but there's rebels.
[03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:58.120]  Once we round all them up, then it'll be utopia.
[03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:04.219]  And again, it's a globalist fashion system internationally, but they want communist systems domestically.
[03:12:04.379 --> 03:12:06.299]  And then it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[03:12:06.579 --> 03:12:08.379]  But the people that are in the scam...
[03:12:09.619 --> 03:12:11.280]  Never want to admit they got scammed.
[03:12:11.399 --> 03:12:14.639]  It's like a Nigerian email where they go, give me $5,000, you get $100,000.
[03:12:14.819 --> 03:12:18.559]  You give them $5,000, oh, sorry, we need $10,000 more, but now you get a million.
[03:12:18.879 --> 03:12:22.379]  Then you get them $10,000, now you get $10 million, but you got to give me $400,000.
[03:12:22.819 --> 03:12:25.200]  And people will sell their houses.
[03:12:25.399 --> 03:12:27.899]  Well, I've already invested so much in this, I've got to keep investing.
[03:12:28.239 --> 03:12:29.739]  They got Bitcoin scams.
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:39.549]  I'm not saying Bitcoin's a scam, but there's scams around Bitcoin and other things where they do similar crap So they're already setting it up for women to register for the draft.
[03:12:39.729 --> 03:12:41.069]  This is serious, people.
[03:12:41.229 --> 03:12:42.250]  This is real tyranny.
[03:12:42.370 --> 03:12:43.450]  And people go, well, that's not going to happen.
[03:12:44.129 --> 03:12:45.649]  Tyranny is the norm in history.
[03:12:45.829 --> 03:12:48.250]  Freedom is very rare and a precious jewel to be protected.
[03:12:50.069 --> 03:12:50.829]  We're going to go to break.
[03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:54.049]  Come back with Josh and everybody else in the order that your calls are received.
[03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:55.129]  Josh and then Scott.
[03:12:55.809 --> 03:12:58.190]  And then everybody else can't wait to talk to all of you.
[03:12:58.329 --> 03:13:00.370]  And then in 30 minutes, Owen Schroyer of the War Room.
[03:13:00.909 --> 03:13:05.290]  And I just think about the great job Owen does and Harrison and the crew and our decades on air.
[03:13:05.469 --> 03:13:07.450]  And just, they're trying to shut us down on the 13th.
[03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:09.750]  That's just emblematic of we're all in so much trouble.
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:12.620]  This is historic moments.
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:18.659]  And again, there wouldn't be such incredible effort by the corrupt Justice Department to take me off air if we weren't effective.
[03:13:18.659 --> 03:13:20.600]  That shows they're not invincible.
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:25.680]  Here's the piece I was just talking about that the great folks at the Maha Alliance put out.
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:26.260]  We'll be right back.
[03:13:27.959 --> 03:13:32.040]  If you are a young adult or the parent of one, please listen carefully.
[03:13:32.559 --> 03:13:37.000]  The United States is closer now to World War III than ever before.
[03:13:37.239 --> 03:13:41.440]  Russia, China and Iran have announced the three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.
[03:13:41.579 --> 03:13:44.959]  The alliance that's been formed should chill us all to the bone.
[03:13:45.139 --> 03:13:54.280]  In preparation for war, 100% of Democrats in the House Armed Services Committee support the military drafting of women aged 18 to 25.
[03:13:54.569 --> 03:13:58.549]  Congress advancing a plan to draft women into the military.
[03:13:58.770 --> 03:14:03.530]  The proposals would automatically register men for the draft on their 18th birthday.
[03:14:03.790 --> 03:14:05.649]  It would also require women to enter.
[03:14:05.850 --> 03:14:09.290]  Even so, Republican pushback is holding the bill back.
[03:14:09.549 --> 03:14:12.170]  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24?
[03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:14.030]  They are stupid.
[03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:18.250]  That is why we put them in dormitories.
[03:14:18.590 --> 03:14:21.129]  They make really bad decisions.
[03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:28.590]  For the love of our sons and daughters, whatever you do, do not vote blue.
[03:14:30.270 --> 03:14:36.250]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.

[03:15:36.889 --> 03:15:42.450]  Six days until the greatest threat America has ever faced is upon us.
[03:15:43.610 --> 03:15:52.569]  Any time now, the deep state can make good on their story that right-wingers, Trump supporters, are about to kill the Hispanics and blacks to make all their foolish lies look real.
[03:15:53.069 --> 03:15:55.350]  Because it isn't foolish if they stage it.
[03:15:55.430 --> 03:15:56.790]  It can make people believe it.
[03:15:57.209 --> 03:16:02.989]  I am the only major talk show host exposing the obvious enemy next move.
[03:16:03.229 --> 03:16:04.750]  That's a big problem.
[03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:08.750]  If I believe the things I'm saying...
[03:16:10.430 --> 03:16:11.350]  I would be urgent.
[03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:12.250]  I would be concerned.
[03:16:12.250 --> 03:16:12.950]  And I do.
[03:16:13.569 --> 03:16:16.209]  But hopefully by exposing it, we can back them off.
[03:16:17.350 --> 03:16:19.649]  I talked about this, and I'll go to your calls in a few minutes.
[03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:24.350]  But I think the assault on the Death Star is a great analogy of where we are right now.
[03:16:24.450 --> 03:16:25.690]  People should take it so seriously.
[03:16:26.969 --> 03:16:28.430]  Death Star approaching.
[03:16:29.069 --> 03:16:30.489]  Estimated time to firing range.
[03:16:45.139 --> 03:16:46.459]  All wings report in.
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:47.399]  Red 10 standing by.
[03:16:47.540 --> 03:16:48.620]  Red 7 standing by.
[03:16:48.780 --> 03:16:49.760]  Red 3 standing by.
[03:16:49.899 --> 03:16:51.219]  Red 6 standing by.
[03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:52.340]  Red 9 standing by.
[03:16:52.559 --> 03:16:53.559]  Red 2 standing by.
[03:16:53.719 --> 03:16:54.840]  Red 11 standing by.
[03:16:55.079 --> 03:16:56.459]  Red 5 standing by.
[03:16:57.979 --> 03:16:59.700]  Lock air spoils in attack position.
[03:17:04.079 --> 03:17:06.180]  We're crossing through the magnetic field.
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:07.100]  Hold tight.
[03:17:07.559 --> 03:17:09.780]  Red 2 deflectors on double front.
[03:17:13.979 --> 03:17:15.319]  Look at the size of that thing.
[03:17:15.420 --> 03:17:16.500]  Cut the shot, Red 2.
[03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:18.120]  Accelerate to attack speed.
[03:17:21.440 --> 03:17:22.500]  This is it, boys.
[03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:24.200]  Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
[03:17:24.379 --> 03:17:25.479]  I copy, Gold Leader.
[03:17:25.659 --> 03:17:26.020]  We're starting.
[03:17:26.120 --> 03:17:27.200]  For the target shaft now.
[03:17:27.440 --> 03:17:28.159]  We're in position.
[03:17:28.399 --> 03:17:30.799]  I'm going to cut across the axes and try and draw their fire.
[03:17:56.520 --> 03:18:08.629]  And the point of this is, in any real war, and this is obviously a movie, but it's an allegory of it, you notice Cut across them with the main attack group to draw their fire.
[03:18:08.989 --> 03:18:16.909]  When you get attacked by the globalists and don't take it like a victim or a weakling, you have to understand we're drawing the enemy out.
[03:18:17.149 --> 03:18:19.989]  We're making them behave like the tyrants they are.
[03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:20.969]  This is a process.
[03:18:21.690 --> 03:18:24.270]  We've now got the enemy completely unmasked.
[03:18:25.090 --> 03:18:27.870]  So folks, tune into the show and I see the comments on X. They go, wait a minute.
[03:18:27.969 --> 03:18:29.370]  One minute he says it's a landslide.
[03:18:29.530 --> 03:18:31.209]  The next minute he says we're totally screwed.
[03:18:31.370 --> 03:18:32.629]  It's a war, people.
[03:18:32.809 --> 03:18:34.010]  They're going to strike back.
[03:18:34.010 --> 03:18:35.010]  We are winning.
[03:18:35.709 --> 03:18:37.450]  We do have the blueprint of the enemy.
[03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:38.709]  We will destroy them.
[03:18:38.969 --> 03:18:43.190]  But you have to admit you're in a war and you have to admit they're not going to take us on head on.
[03:18:43.350 --> 03:18:45.110]  They're going to frame us for stuff.
[03:18:47.270 --> 03:18:48.690]  They're screaming it.
[03:18:48.809 --> 03:18:53.049]  They're saying we are going to kill minorities in the next week.
[03:18:56.169 --> 03:18:57.629]  It's ridiculously obvious.
[03:19:01.530 --> 03:19:04.510]  And so I'm simply saying to people, what are we going to do about that?
[03:19:04.629 --> 03:19:05.729]  Well, number one, we're not behind it.
[03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:06.409]  We don't have the motive.
[03:19:06.530 --> 03:19:07.469]  They have a history of doing it.
[03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:11.409]  I just want people to understand how serious it is.
[03:19:12.290 --> 03:19:16.250]  Because the Western world is going to be vaporized by the globalists.
[03:19:16.409 --> 03:19:17.610]  They know there's a huge awakening.
[03:19:17.809 --> 03:19:21.370]  And everywhere they're saying, they're clamping down and bringing in total tyranny.
[03:19:22.370 --> 03:19:22.989]  Which again...
[03:19:26.359 --> 03:19:30.479]  I would like to get Trump in because it's the moral thing to do to try to fix things.
[03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:35.399]  And it's not going to be perfect, and they're going to hit us with a bunch of garbage.
[03:19:37.260 --> 03:19:41.700]  But it signifies that there's not just totally insane people in charge.
[03:19:47.090 --> 03:19:49.129]  We have a moral responsibility to try to fix things.
[03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:53.069]  But I'm not going to lie to you about how dire the situation is.
[03:19:53.190 --> 03:20:07.530]  It's only because it's gotten so obviously dangerous and insane that people are finally waking up out of just deep instincts or some have God's spirit in them to understand this.
[03:20:09.129 --> 03:20:12.889]  But This is not a carnival.
[03:20:13.049 --> 03:20:15.350]  This is not fun time.
[03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:23.670]  This is a war for the future destiny of a species against a transhumanist, satanic death cult who's openly wanting to depopulate us.
[03:20:24.030 --> 03:20:33.870]  I mean, Bill Gates is on record everywhere running a global depopulation fund, that's the real name of his foundation, saying he wants to depopulate the earth, and then he gives people poison shots on top of it.
[03:20:33.930 --> 03:20:34.489]  My God!
[03:20:38.069 --> 03:20:42.649]  And they got all these plans to just shut down the farms and take over your bodies.
[03:20:42.909 --> 03:20:47.950]  And the New York Times, oh, Trump's escalating calls for violence.
[03:20:48.090 --> 03:20:49.209]  No, he's not, you liars.
[03:20:52.049 --> 03:20:52.829]  And look at this.
[03:20:53.129 --> 03:20:55.590]  Stop counting votes or we're going to murder your children.
[03:20:55.709 --> 03:21:03.969]  The Atlantic, that's the CIA. And again, there's two groups they've telegraphed that they're going to hit.
[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:07.739]  They say Trump supporters are going to kill blacks and Hispanics.
[03:21:08.760 --> 03:21:10.700]  And that they're going to kill election officials.
[03:21:11.659 --> 03:21:17.959]  And then they say an election official is just the person that runs the doors and brings the people in.
[03:21:18.159 --> 03:21:21.219]  Oh, look, this poor lady works here and they're going to kill her.
[03:21:26.180 --> 03:21:30.299]  So they're going to kill election workers and blame us.
[03:21:30.860 --> 03:21:31.899]  And they're going to kill...
[03:21:32.940 --> 03:21:34.239]  Brown people and blame us.
[03:21:34.520 --> 03:21:36.940]  And it's everywhere with no evidence.
[03:21:37.159 --> 03:21:39.280]  Again, people are like, yeah, well, you just said this 50 times.
[03:21:39.399 --> 03:21:40.180]  It'll last three hours.
[03:21:40.360 --> 03:21:42.899]  I'll probably say it 10 more times in the next 25 minutes.
[03:21:48.040 --> 03:21:50.520]  Because I'm sitting here watching them run the play.
[03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:52.840]  And my job is to beat them.
[03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:55.340]  My job is not to have a fun show.
[03:21:56.040 --> 03:21:57.719]  All right, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:21:59.260]  Good God.
[03:21:59.879 --> 03:22:01.799]  Josh in California, you're on the air.
[03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:02.219]  Go ahead.
[03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:04.370]  Afternoon, Alex.
[03:22:04.809 --> 03:22:06.850]  I think Trump had to lose in 2020.
[03:22:07.090 --> 03:22:09.389]  Didn't he be finishing up his second term right now?
[03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:12.469]  And the things that have been released and revealed would have remained hidden and buried.
[03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:14.329]  Maybe even more so than they are now.
[03:22:14.430 --> 03:22:15.229]  But he had to lose.
[03:22:15.450 --> 03:22:18.629]  He had to lose for Elon to buy Twitter, for you to get reinstated, etc.
[03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:22.370]  There's been all this talk about Trump not draining the swamp and that he never did.
[03:22:22.510 --> 03:22:23.889]  But I think he did by losing.
[03:22:24.049 --> 03:22:25.370]  We had to be shown, not told.
[03:22:25.729 --> 03:22:27.450]  And we know the leftists are who they are.
[03:22:27.549 --> 03:22:28.350]  They're part of the swamp.
[03:22:28.549 --> 03:22:31.149]  They'll never come over to our side of liberty and the Constitution.
[03:22:31.149 --> 03:22:31.770]  They never will.
[03:22:32.280 --> 03:22:33.739]  So we never had to really worry about them.
[03:22:33.819 --> 03:22:37.139]  But what's been revealed for me is who from the right were also part of the swamp.
[03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:44.639]  What corporations were the swamp, CEOs, NGOs, that were basically ghosts that have been exposed over the last four years.
[03:22:45.040 --> 03:22:50.040]  Trump losing gave rise to independent media, and I think you'll be able to corroborate this because you know about history than I do.
[03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:57.250]  But it's like FDR talking to the leader of France during World War II, Charles de Gaulle, and the French leader basically said, I'll sacrifice my people to win the war.
[03:22:57.350 --> 03:22:58.170]  This is not unique.
[03:22:58.469 --> 03:23:04.709]  Like the Byzantine Empire being conquered by the Ottoman Empire, they had people from within that led to the attacking of Constantinople.
[03:23:04.829 --> 03:23:05.889]  Something had to lead to the fall.
[03:23:06.209 --> 03:23:11.430]  This is different, but not really, kind of like the World War II reference, where someone or something had to concede for the eventual win.
[03:23:12.090 --> 03:23:14.750]  Many things have been exposed in the last four years for the better.
[03:23:14.930 --> 03:23:17.690]  Things are still dirty and messy right now, but I think it had to happen this way.
[03:23:17.770 --> 03:23:22.010]  Otherwise, the WF's actual plan of 2030 would have occurred right on schedule.
[03:23:22.430 --> 03:23:27.290]  Hate to think that what I'm saying was all planned and had to be because of all the carnage that has come as a result.
[03:23:27.549 --> 03:23:31.250]  It's hard for me to think all of this happened because we allowed it, but I think Trump will win.
[03:23:31.569 --> 03:23:32.809]  But won't be inaugurated.
[03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:34.450]  States won't certify.
[03:23:34.530 --> 03:23:38.069]  I think you're right about what will happen in those two months between election night and inauguration.
[03:23:38.290 --> 03:23:42.870]  But if he isn't certified, they're going to push all the stuff they were sitting on until the day after the election.
[03:23:43.030 --> 03:23:44.170]  So much violence and riots.
[03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:48.690]  That the people won't be paying attention to what they pass through Congress or through his executive orders.
[03:23:49.229 --> 03:23:50.770]  And Kamala is the one to certify, correct?
[03:23:51.309 --> 03:23:51.670]  Yes.
[03:23:51.670 --> 03:24:01.069]  Do you know if there's a global war, and not a civil war, but a global war officially, will Kamala stay in power as a war-type president, or rather Biden will remain if Trump is called as the winner?
[03:24:01.170 --> 03:24:02.030]  Can you speak on that?
[03:24:02.329 --> 03:24:02.930]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:24:03.010 --> 03:24:12.250]  You're the GOAT. No, you're the GOAT. That's the caller said what I've been trying to say for three hours and two minutes, so I... Yeah, any scenario that's possible...
[03:24:14.319 --> 03:24:15.840]  They've said they're going to try to steal it.
[03:24:16.799 --> 03:24:18.879]  If that doesn't work, they won't certify it.
[03:24:18.899 --> 03:24:36.659]  They create so much civil unrest, they'll have to have false flags against poll workers and brown people, is what they said, to demonize Trump so much that it would legitimize whoever else they're going to bring forward.
[03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:37.819]  I guess that would be Kamala.
[03:24:38.739 --> 03:24:57.700]  We're good to go.
[03:25:02.579 --> 03:25:14.379]  That if there's such a big decisive win, and I'm seeing a landslide, but again, it won't look like one, then there might be some sane people, I'm seeing some signs of it, and Trump gets in.
[03:25:16.739 --> 03:25:20.239]  That if there's a big win that night, then they might not pull all this.
[03:25:20.879 --> 03:25:22.520]  Because there's different camps in the globalists.
[03:25:22.639 --> 03:25:30.920]  But it looks to me, with that Homeland Security coming out in the last 24 hours, and just saying, oh my God, the Trump people are just going to blow everything up.
[03:25:32.110 --> 03:25:43.069]  And for any thoughtful person that's informed, that's as dumb as saying Trump's Hitler because the Nazis had a rally, the American Nazis, 85 years ago, six, seven years before he was born.
[03:25:43.350 --> 03:25:45.190]  What the hell does that even mean?
[03:25:45.549 --> 03:25:46.549]  It's the same thing.
[03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:48.909]  Where is Trump attacking black people?
[03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:50.709]  Or where is he stopping interracial marriages?
[03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:52.649]  It's just all horseman-er.
[03:25:53.329 --> 03:25:53.909]  Where are people?
[03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:57.350]  I mean, FBI is like, oh my God, people are going to kill the election workers.
[03:26:00.239 --> 03:26:01.059]  I mean, look at USA Today.
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:03.700]  The crew's just throwing these headlines up one after the other.
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:05.239]  We'll hunt you, Trump.
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:07.760]  MAGA supporters' violent rhetoric isn't a glitch.
[03:26:07.860 --> 03:26:08.340]  It's a feature.
[03:26:09.159 --> 03:26:12.139]  By the way, you guys have probably put 10 articles up the last 10 minutes showing.
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:13.219]  I didn't even see these headlines.
[03:26:13.379 --> 03:26:14.479]  I mean, I already see so many.
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:15.799]  Just print everything you're showing.
[03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:16.440]  Just print me this.
[03:26:16.559 --> 03:26:17.879]  I'm going to do an emergency report on this.
[03:26:18.850 --> 03:26:20.350]  They're telegraphing their move.
[03:26:20.569 --> 03:26:21.250]  They pre-program.
[03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:23.170]  And I know your ears are bleeding.
[03:26:23.409 --> 03:26:24.229]  You've already heard it.
[03:26:24.649 --> 03:26:26.590]  Remember, it's the prodigal son.
[03:26:26.809 --> 03:26:31.290]  I'm not looking for the regular listeners that know what's going on, many of you more than I do.
[03:26:32.430 --> 03:26:39.149]  I'm trying to get the people who are new listeners who are so important because they're going to be the whistleblowers.
[03:26:39.450 --> 03:26:42.930]  They're going to be the camel, the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[03:26:44.850 --> 03:26:46.350]  Remember, the prodigal son story.
[03:26:47.409 --> 03:26:48.670]  He goes away, takes his inheritance.
[03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:49.690]  He's the junior son.
[03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:53.250]  Comes back, you know, a decade later, lost everything.
[03:26:53.909 --> 03:26:56.709]  And his father says, go kill our best calf, have a huge party.
[03:26:56.870 --> 03:27:01.969]  And the number one son that always was loyal and worked hard said, Dad, you never threw a party for me.
[03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:04.670]  His dad says, because you're the best.
[03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:06.049]  You didn't run off like a loser.
[03:27:06.190 --> 03:27:07.370]  You get it all when I die.
[03:27:08.069 --> 03:27:11.389]  Think how much I care about you or throwing a party for your dumb young brother.
[03:27:12.989 --> 03:27:16.930]  I don't need to throw parties for you because you're not a loser.
[03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:21.229]  This is a reflection of how much I love you.
[03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:26.969]  We'll throw the party for the dumbasses because we need to save them.
[03:27:27.409 --> 03:27:29.069]  That's what Christ was sent to do.
[03:27:30.370 --> 03:27:33.090]  It'd be easy if everybody was smart and knew what was going on.
[03:27:33.309 --> 03:27:34.930]  God gave us a big job.
[03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:38.770]  We're looking for the prodigal sons.
[03:27:39.170 --> 03:27:40.270]  It's our job.
[03:27:43.220 --> 03:27:45.180]  Scott in California, you're on the air.
[03:27:45.280 --> 03:27:45.600]  Go ahead.
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:52.819]  Yeah, could your great crew pull up the Kamala clip, quote, can you help a girl out?
[03:27:53.079 --> 03:28:01.920]  I believe she's dealing with, over in Europe, the Polish counterpart to her position three years or so ago.
[03:28:02.100 --> 03:28:03.579]  I remember, can you help a girl out?
[03:28:03.639 --> 03:28:05.139]  I didn't play the clip earlier on about censorship.
[03:28:05.860 --> 03:28:07.079]  It was pathetic.
[03:28:07.420 --> 03:28:11.020]  The idea that this thing, women, could...
[03:28:12.789 --> 03:28:15.030]  Actually negotiate world events.
[03:28:16.069 --> 03:28:17.670]  I mean, absurd.
[03:28:20.129 --> 03:28:21.450]  But that's why they want her.
[03:28:21.610 --> 03:28:23.870]  So they can blame the disasters they create on her.
[03:28:23.950 --> 03:28:32.989]  They even admit that in CFR and WEF documents that have come out in the last 15 years where they go, oh, we're putting idiots in place to demoralize people.
[03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:36.909]  You know, I tried to find that clip.
[03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.969]  I couldn't find it.
[03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:39.389]  Anyway, if you got...
[03:28:39.389 --> 03:28:41.250]  What was the exact quote of Kamala Harris?
[03:28:41.350 --> 03:28:42.229]  Give a girl a break?
[03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.870]  Yeah, no.
[03:28:44.430 --> 03:28:49.750]  Quote, can you help a girl out to her counterpart over in Europe?
[03:28:49.930 --> 03:28:50.709]  It was disgusting.
[03:28:50.909 --> 03:28:51.370]  It was pathetic.
[03:28:52.430 --> 03:28:56.430]  And that's because she didn't know what planet she was on.
[03:28:57.350 --> 03:28:57.790]  Exactly.
[03:28:58.350 --> 03:29:02.770]  And at the same time, when are you going to get Turbo Force back in?
[03:29:04.280 --> 03:29:05.879]  Let me explain what happened at InfoWars.
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:11.440]  They put a federal trustee in and the judge approved it, but he didn't pick them.
[03:29:11.520 --> 03:29:12.440]  They just rotate through.
[03:29:12.639 --> 03:29:15.520]  So like dozens wouldn't take the job when we were in corporate bankruptcy.
[03:29:16.399 --> 03:29:32.139]  This guy came in, he immediately killed $12 million of advertising a year, got rid of a bunch of our crew, wouldn't order, hardly any of the products, cut us off from going on the road and covering things, lied, lied, lied, tried to set me up in court, tried to say that I had hidden money, that I'd already reported to the court that wasn't hidden money,
[03:29:32.239 --> 03:29:35.159]  that he wouldn't take from a sponsor I had for three months.
[03:29:35.860 --> 03:29:42.319]  So dumb and lazy, he didn't even check that we'd filed with the court months before and said, hey, he's not taking this money, what do we do with it?
[03:29:43.719 --> 03:29:46.420]  And then he tried to shut us down with armed security.
[03:29:46.420 --> 03:29:47.540]  And I said, where's your warrant?
[03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:49.600]  Where's your court order?
[03:29:50.840 --> 03:29:52.319]  They said, yeah, that's actually a good point.
[03:29:52.940 --> 03:29:55.479]  And then he tried to hire another group reportedly to come in here.
[03:29:55.840 --> 03:29:57.020]  And then they did all this.
[03:29:57.159 --> 03:29:59.879]  And then, I mean, it's just gone on from there.
[03:29:59.979 --> 03:30:01.239]  It would take an hour to tell you the whole story.
[03:30:01.479 --> 03:30:08.500]  So it was deliberately, in my view, it was certainly sabotaged, you say deliberately, not deliberately, by these people.
[03:30:09.260 --> 03:30:12.360]  And now the judges found out about it and blocked them again last week in court.
[03:30:12.379 --> 03:30:13.379]  It's just totally insane.
[03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:14.940]  And the sale may not go on now.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:18.159]  And stuff's filed.
[03:30:18.260 --> 03:30:19.159]  It hasn't hit the news yet.
[03:30:19.159 --> 03:30:20.760]  I've been too busy to talk about myself.
[03:30:20.940 --> 03:30:22.600]  But I'm going on the offensive.
[03:30:23.379 --> 03:30:26.840]  And people, when they buy stuff, it goes to studio.com.
[03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:28.110]  It goes to crew.
[03:30:28.450 --> 03:30:32.209]  It goes to legal to hold off the enemies like defense shields on an X-wing.
[03:30:32.909 --> 03:30:34.149]  That's what the legal is.
[03:30:34.809 --> 03:30:36.309]  It's just keep us going.
[03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.870]  Keep us going.
[03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:40.129]  And then, yeah, people buy stuff.
[03:30:40.270 --> 03:30:43.850]  Occasionally, I go to Longhorn Steakhouse and eat a T-bone.
[03:30:44.899 --> 03:30:48.000]  So that's high living for me is to go get a T-bone once a week.
[03:30:48.159 --> 03:30:51.520]  I don't give a rat's ass about status, about money, about nothing.
[03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:53.139]  I want money for war.
[03:30:53.280 --> 03:30:55.799]  I want money to prosecute the attack against the enemy.
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:02.760]  I put my whole name on this, my treasure, my soul, on the sacred altar of God, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[03:31:03.139 --> 03:31:04.559]  And I appreciate your call, Scott.
[03:31:04.700 --> 03:31:08.879]  And that's why I appreciate you all supporting us at the AlexJonesStore.com and DRJonesNaturals.com.
[03:31:08.979 --> 03:31:09.879]  History's happening now.
[03:31:10.120 --> 03:31:11.040]  Now's the time for action.
[03:31:11.120 --> 03:31:11.959]  Let me just do a plug and I'm going to stop.
[03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:16.190]  I told the great sponsors who are awesome, big league, best t-shirts.
[03:31:16.530 --> 03:31:19.450]  I told them all the supplements I wanted, top companies, they private labeled them.
[03:31:19.610 --> 03:31:22.790]  I said, can we get some super low cost items in there?
[03:31:23.530 --> 03:31:26.569]  And these are great private labels of some of the top things out there.
[03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:31.489]  The very same stuff is sold in grocery stores and at Whole Foods.
[03:31:31.549 --> 03:31:35.870]  We just have a new name and stuff on it for $20 to $25 a package.
[03:31:37.170 --> 03:31:40.069]  We're selling it for $14 and change.
[03:31:40.209 --> 03:31:41.770]  You buy more, it's lower than that.
[03:31:42.350 --> 03:31:57.329]  Energy gummies with caffeine, taurine, guarana, and B12, and a great sleep support, melatonin, L-theanine, GABA, chamomile, and lavender concentrate, mixed berry, and strawberry flavor.
[03:31:59.750 --> 03:32:02.690]  Those are some of the new great supplements at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:32:02.770 --> 03:32:11.809]  And today and tomorrow, the last days, every time you buy something, you get put in the rabble for the incredible ultimate super off-road Dodge turbo diesel off-road package truck and $10,000 cash on top of it.
[03:32:11.909 --> 03:32:17.030]  And when you spend $30 a month and cancel any time, you get $40 each month to buy product in the store.
[03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.930]  Boy, that's a good deal.
[03:32:18.069 --> 03:32:20.469]  And special offers and other discounts emailed right to you.
[03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:22.829]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:32:22.969 --> 03:32:24.670]  And yeah, we want you to get the products and love them.
[03:32:24.770 --> 03:32:28.510]  And then remember that you've got a membership, so you spend the money there.
[03:32:28.510 --> 03:32:29.610]  So we have a relationship.
[03:32:29.770 --> 03:32:30.809]  It's what we want.
[03:32:30.930 --> 03:32:31.790]  A relationship.
[03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:36.450]  We're not trying to highway Robbie and hit you on the head and one and done.
[03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:49.159]  We're trying to politically get married to you so we can come together and Build organizations to take on the globalists, build our own economy, our own civilization, which in their own documents have come out, they're the most scared of.
[03:32:49.260 --> 03:32:57.479]  I am waging 100% war, swinging for the fences, biting them, stabbing them, scratching them, kicking them.
[03:32:58.290 --> 03:33:02.649]  And I kick like a mule and I bite like a crocodile, but only because of your prayer and support.
[03:33:02.729 --> 03:33:06.030]  And you are energizing me and I can feel the prayer and I can see the support.
[03:33:06.209 --> 03:33:08.670]  And so I'm just saying, this is war.
[03:33:09.149 --> 03:33:10.969]  This is big time war.
[03:33:11.170 --> 03:33:11.989]  I need your backing.
[03:33:12.149 --> 03:33:13.530]  Paul in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.870]  Welcome.
[03:33:15.489 --> 03:33:16.190]  Thank you.
[03:33:16.530 --> 03:33:20.729]  Hey, like you say it, the Globus are going to do what they say they will.
[03:33:20.909 --> 03:33:25.469]  You don't see any other newscast out there on TV broadcasting your research.
[03:33:26.820 --> 03:33:28.719]  So people, just go out and vote.
[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:29.639]  It's common sense.
[03:33:29.819 --> 03:33:30.840]  Vote for common sense.
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:31.620]  Vote for Trump.
[03:33:32.219 --> 03:33:35.819]  And Alex, thank you for your 30 years of hard, dedicated work.
[03:33:36.840 --> 03:33:37.700]  God bless you.
[03:33:37.879 --> 03:33:38.780]  Thank you so much.
[03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:41.079]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:33:41.159 --> 03:33:41.579]  Anything else?
[03:33:43.979 --> 03:33:45.780]  We're touching on the MSG event.
[03:33:46.040 --> 03:33:54.120]  I think it would have been fabulous if they would have brought on the Reverend Franklin Graham at the end with the closing prayer.
[03:33:55.190 --> 03:34:00.590]  And they always forget about the World War II vet who was at the RNC. You know, you want a morale boost?
[03:34:00.590 --> 03:34:02.329]  Just watch that video again.
[03:34:02.610 --> 03:34:04.809]  The vet in Reverend Franklin Graham.
[03:34:04.989 --> 03:34:05.530]  It's unbelievable.
[03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:06.370]  I agree.
[03:34:07.409 --> 03:34:08.389]  God's not first.
[03:34:08.530 --> 03:34:09.069]  God's everything.
[03:34:09.350 --> 03:34:11.790]  They should have started it and ended it with a prayer.
[03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:17.049]  But at least they didn't have an abortion truck and a vasectomy facility inside it like the DNC in Chicago.
[03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.670]  Great points.
[03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:19.729]  Chad in Alabama, you're on the air.
[03:34:19.829 --> 03:34:20.110]  Go ahead.
[03:34:20.209 --> 03:34:20.670]  Thanks for calling.
[03:34:22.209 --> 03:34:22.930]  Hey, Alex.
[03:34:23.149 --> 03:34:24.209]  Good to talk to the legend.
[03:34:24.370 --> 03:34:25.350]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[03:34:25.870 --> 03:34:29.350]  First of all, let me just say thanks to this wonderful economy.
[03:34:29.350 --> 03:34:36.690]  I've been laid off four times and starting up my own business and barely had a chance to purchase a couple of shirts the other day.
[03:34:36.709 --> 03:34:38.829]  So I'm pretty excited about those because...
[03:34:38.829 --> 03:34:39.690]  Well, that means a lot.
[03:34:39.829 --> 03:34:43.530]  The folks that aren't, you know, in the best of times still supporting, you're incredible.
[03:34:45.909 --> 03:34:47.090]  I had to, man.
[03:34:47.270 --> 03:34:47.690]  I had to.
[03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:51.809]  It was killing me, and I got two shirts coming my way and a bumper sticker.
[03:34:51.969 --> 03:34:52.329]  Thank you.
[03:34:52.549 --> 03:34:53.889]  Pretty excited about that.
[03:34:54.069 --> 03:34:56.870]  But yeah, the economy is pure shit.
[03:34:57.149 --> 03:35:00.909]  But nonetheless, I wanted to just say, I'm trying to get your take.
[03:35:01.010 --> 03:35:02.229]  What's your more concern with?
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:11.940]  Keep my mail, the illegals voting or the systems like Dominion, ES&S, Smartmatic Software.
[03:35:12.319 --> 03:35:15.780]  Didn't know what your take was as far as which one concerns you more.
[03:35:16.020 --> 03:35:20.639]  It just seems like the software is the place where they can really click the numbers on us.
[03:35:21.250 --> 03:35:30.549]  But there's so many, I agree, in the past, but now because of all the audits, their favorite way is just to flood the zone with fake voters and then run the fake ballots through.
[03:35:30.809 --> 03:35:36.409]  And then if they don't get above Trump, then they just produce a bunch more so they can cram those through.
[03:35:36.670 --> 03:35:40.569]  And then it's so hard to go over the individual ballots, it becomes a giant mess.
[03:35:40.850 --> 03:35:43.530]  Whereas forensic auditors can go in and see the machines.
[03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:44.610]  So it used to be machines.
[03:35:45.049 --> 03:35:47.069]  The last 30 years that were the big scam.
[03:35:47.250 --> 03:35:57.709]  Now they're moving to just bombing everything with people that register that aren't citizens, people that register that are double voting, those databases, and then just flooding it with pure crap.
[03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:59.229]  Yeah.
[03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.950]  Got it.
[03:36:00.129 --> 03:36:00.450]  Got it.
[03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:03.450]  Hey, Alex, do you ever have Clay Parikh on your show?
[03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:06.149]  He's the cyber expert on the voting machine.
[03:36:07.909 --> 03:36:09.229]  No, but I've heard the name.
[03:36:09.350 --> 03:36:09.889]  We should get him on.
[03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.649]  Thank you so much.
[03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:11.450]  Trying to jam everybody in.
[03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:12.149]  Sorry I've been ranting.
[03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.930]  Dr.
[03:36:13.129 --> 03:36:13.790]  Nichols in Georgia.
[03:36:13.829 --> 03:36:14.190]  Welcome.
[03:36:14.329 --> 03:36:14.690]  You're on the air.
[03:36:14.770 --> 03:36:15.049]  Go ahead.
[03:36:16.069 --> 03:36:17.010]  Hey, my name is Dr.
[03:36:17.149 --> 03:36:19.329]  Jackie Nichols, founder of the Redemption Party.
[03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:21.010]  I'm actually a presidential candidate.
[03:36:21.149 --> 03:36:31.920]  It's been in my campaign in 2023, but due to your wonderful Reset Wars seminar, I started my own Political party in January of 2023.
[03:36:32.219 --> 03:36:35.459]  We run our first election in November of 2023, so I want to thank you for that.
[03:36:35.559 --> 03:36:35.879]  Thank you.
[03:36:36.540 --> 03:36:53.459]  As far as the election goes, I honestly think they're going to pull an FDR. I know that's horrible to say, but I really think with all these wars going on, they're going to look at that as their last-ditch effort to stay in power and suspend the elections,
[03:36:53.459 --> 03:37:03.389]  and then if they pull it even further, have, like you said before, Biden passed away and then her be installed as the first female president.
[03:37:04.170 --> 03:37:05.709]  Like Harry Truman.
[03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:07.309]  Exactly.
[03:37:07.610 --> 03:37:07.950]  Exactly.
[03:37:08.290 --> 03:37:14.389]  I mean, I really see them going that route because they know that we are far more powerful than they think.
[03:37:14.530 --> 03:37:21.569]  And I also think we should have a National Day of Prayer on the 5th, starting at 12.01, November 5th a.m.
[03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.770]  I agree.
[03:37:22.989 --> 03:37:26.170]  In fact, I'm going to do a video on that call for everybody to start praying at what?
[03:37:27.350 --> 03:37:29.690]  12.01 Eastern is a good time.
[03:37:29.809 --> 03:37:31.670]  11 p.m.
[03:37:33.350 --> 03:37:35.649]  and then midnight a.m.
[03:37:36.030 --> 03:37:36.450]  in the east.
[03:37:36.569 --> 03:37:37.190]  That's a great idea.
[03:37:38.129 --> 03:37:39.370]  I just want to tell you one thing.
[03:37:39.489 --> 03:37:40.670]  You are not a racist, sir.
[03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:43.510]  Okay, I got your Alex Jones was right t-shirt.
[03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:47.090]  I got my 1776 hat and you are my brother in Christ.
[03:37:47.549 --> 03:37:49.569]  Well, thank you and I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:50.829]  Thank you so much.
[03:37:51.989 --> 03:37:52.309]  Absolutely.
[03:37:53.149 --> 03:37:54.090]  I'm team humanity.
[03:37:54.969 --> 03:37:55.889]  I'm for humanity.
[03:37:57.010 --> 03:37:58.190]  And that's what we're doing.
[03:37:58.489 --> 03:38:01.170]  And I mean, I got Elon Musk to agree with me on air and say, yeah, let's launch team humanity.
[03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:03.149]  So that's what we're doing here together.
[03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:05.290]  Tony in Florida, last caller.
[03:38:05.409 --> 03:38:05.870]  Thanks for calling.
[03:38:08.159 --> 03:38:10.700]  Hi, Alex, and hi, all the listeners and crew.
[03:38:10.860 --> 03:38:13.219]  And I just want to thank you and the crew for everything that you do.
[03:38:13.420 --> 03:38:19.520]  And also, I want to thank the listeners for just opening their eyes, hearts, and minds so we can bond together and we can take this.
[03:38:19.840 --> 03:38:21.620]  I have a couple things I wanted.
[03:38:21.719 --> 03:38:25.180]  The first thing I wanted to say is I foresee us taking this election.
[03:38:25.769 --> 03:38:31.389]  Hugely, because everybody voting early and all that, it gives them an opportunity to count the ballots as we go along.
[03:38:31.569 --> 03:38:36.930]  So there's not as much messery on the last day, which is why I believe that President Trump asked us to vote early.
[03:38:37.149 --> 03:38:40.870]  But I foresee an insurrection in January coming.
[03:38:41.190 --> 03:38:43.690]  You know, we're going to take it by a landslide.
[03:38:43.809 --> 03:38:45.690]  They're going to say, okay, well, they had an insurrection.
[03:38:46.129 --> 03:38:49.649]  We should be able to go ahead and have an insurrection, although I know that was gaslighting.
[03:38:49.709 --> 03:38:51.090]  We didn't really have an insurrection.
[03:38:51.290 --> 03:39:03.700]  But we're going to see one this time that's The summer, fall, winter of love that we experience in 2020 will be nothing like what I believe that we're going to experience come January if we take this election in a huge landslide.
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:05.299]  I don't believe they're going to take it sitting down.
[03:39:05.420 --> 03:39:06.840]  We know they're not going to stop.
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:12.700]  The good thing is that the kingdom was promised to us, and we need to keep our eyes on the prize and just keep pushing forward.
[03:39:12.860 --> 03:39:19.799]  And I wanted to ask your permission, Alex, if I could just rally the country and sing America the Beautiful to close the show out today, please.
[03:39:20.639 --> 03:39:29.319]  I tell you what, we'll get your name and number and we'll call you back and have you do it tomorrow if you answer because I'm out of time in 40 seconds and Owen Schroyer takes over with the War Room.
[03:39:29.700 --> 03:39:34.540]  Everybody, please go to Real Alex Jones, retweet the War Room, retweet the network feed.
[03:39:34.780 --> 03:39:35.659]  Thank you so much, Tony.
[03:39:35.819 --> 03:39:36.420]  Put her on hold.
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:39.620]  If she wants to do that tomorrow, we'll call her back and we will do it if we're here tomorrow.
[03:39:40.129 --> 03:39:41.209]  Don't take anything for granted.
[03:39:41.549 --> 03:39:42.870]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:39:43.090 --> 03:39:50.549]  Now take the live feeds from Real Alex Jones and share them because the refeed of my show is about to begin and then Owen will be on the network feed and the war room feed.
[03:39:50.729 --> 03:39:51.790]  He's really been on fire.
[03:39:51.889 --> 03:39:53.069]  He's always great, but he's been wow.
[03:39:53.610 --> 03:39:57.649]  Owen Schroyer coming up and we're going to have live election coverage all next week.
[03:39:57.829 --> 03:39:58.149]  Everything.
[03:40:00.079 --> 03:40:01.139]  We know the enemy plan.
[03:40:01.299 --> 03:40:02.120]  We're exposing them.
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:02.940]  They're in deep trouble.
[03:40:03.079 --> 03:40:06.079]  I want to be key about that, but we've got to face how dangerous they are.
[03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:07.399]  God bless you all.
[03:40:07.780 --> 03:40:09.000]  You see it everywhere.
[03:40:09.319 --> 03:40:10.299]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:40:10.479 --> 03:40:11.540]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:20.399]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[03:40:21.079 --> 03:40:27.239]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games and I've been accurate about 98% of the time.
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:29.020]  I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[03:40:29.159 --> 03:40:30.200]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[03:40:30.219 --> 03:40:30.879]  I've made mistakes.
[03:40:31.739 --> 03:40:38.979]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[03:40:39.100 --> 03:40:43.219]  And we're reaching tens of millions of new people every day.
[03:40:43.479 --> 03:40:44.899]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:40:45.459 --> 03:40:47.739]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:49.200]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[03:40:49.909 --> 03:40:52.989]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[03:40:53.969 --> 03:41:01.209]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:03.870]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[03:41:03.989 --> 03:41:06.510]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed...
[03:41:07.219 --> 03:41:13.620]  There's been backup systems set up, and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[03:41:13.659 --> 03:41:18.020]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[03:41:18.079 --> 03:41:22.219]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[03:41:22.479 --> 03:41:24.780]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[03:41:24.780 --> 03:41:26.540]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[03:41:27.420 --> 03:41:33.059]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.

[03:42:13.100 --> 03:42:15.379]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[03:42:15.819 --> 03:42:18.559]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[03:42:18.899 --> 03:42:29.000]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like Organic B Complex.
[03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:36.549]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[03:42:36.709 --> 03:42:37.690]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:42:37.809 --> 03:42:42.829]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:44.510]  But everybody feels it.
[03:42:44.629 --> 03:42:49.350]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want.
[03:42:49.430 --> 03:42:49.850]  A lot of people do.
[03:42:50.110 --> 03:42:54.149]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[03:42:54.940 --> 03:42:58.780]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[03:42:59.059 --> 03:43:01.760]  You want to experience next level foundational energy.
[03:43:01.879 --> 03:43:05.760]  Just like our information, it's absolutely amazing, and I know you're going to want to order it again.

[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:11.899]  People love it.
[03:43:12.500 --> 03:43:13.920]  So limited supply came back in.
[03:43:14.020 --> 03:43:18.020]  Get your next level of financial energy now at drjonesnaturals.com.

[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:24.600]  It makes it deeper, more restful, so good for your immune system.
[03:43:25.059 --> 03:43:26.040]  Try Rocket Rest.
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:31.200]  If you want a stimulant that's all natural and really works well, well, that's top brain, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:43:31.420 --> 03:43:31.920]  It's strong.
[03:43:32.079 --> 03:43:33.200]  People are blown away by it.
[03:43:33.520 --> 03:43:35.319]  They're like, wow, this is something else.
[03:43:35.440 --> 03:43:36.739]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[03:43:37.020 --> 03:43:41.559]  And then, of course, there's a good, high-quality, staple, organic base, so it's not synthetic.
[03:43:41.920 --> 03:43:45.180]  Whole food, concentrate, multivitamin, a good basis.
[03:43:46.739 --> 03:43:47.579]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[03:43:47.799 --> 03:43:48.860]  Foundation for everything you're doing?
[03:43:48.979 --> 03:43:49.760]  That's a good staple.
[03:43:49.940 --> 03:43:54.879]  If you're looking for high-quality multivitamin, it's a private label of a very top, high-rated one that's got five stars.
[03:43:55.340 --> 03:44:01.819]  And so many other great products, like the concentrated seed sprouts that are so good for your gut, so good for your body.
[03:44:02.180 --> 03:44:09.040]  Just some of the sprouts, your gut uses them, it's a long story, to create a special type of...
[03:44:09.489 --> 03:44:14.790]  I mean, no acid that only your intestines can create that helps regrow, you know, tendons, muscle.
[03:44:14.989 --> 03:44:16.809]  I mean, it's gut wall health.
[03:44:16.969 --> 03:44:19.229]  You want to get fiber green concentrates.

[03:45:02.459 --> 03:45:03.600]  I want the line around the block.
[03:45:03.719 --> 03:45:04.799]  My dad wants the line around...
[03:45:05.549 --> 03:45:07.209]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:45:07.430 --> 03:45:09.889]  So you've got to try it to see how great it is.
[03:45:10.489 --> 03:45:11.290]  DRJonesNaturals.com.

[03:47:29.549 --> 03:47:33.270]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.

[03:48:11.809 --> 03:48:12.770]  That's $10 you make.
[03:48:13.010 --> 03:48:23.629]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, and sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[03:48:24.270 --> 03:48:27.549]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:36.329]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:39.649]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced on the 30th this month.
[03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.709]  You want to win?
[03:48:40.909 --> 03:48:44.590]  I know you do, because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[03:48:44.850 --> 03:48:47.229]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[03:48:47.729 --> 03:48:49.469]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[03:48:49.649 --> 03:48:51.370]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:54.969]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:56.709]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[03:48:56.920 --> 03:48:59.520]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[03:48:59.840 --> 03:49:04.780]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[03:49:04.979 --> 03:49:06.020]  You're in the know.
[03:49:06.420 --> 03:49:08.260]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[03:49:08.920 --> 03:49:09.500]  Pre-shipping.
[03:49:09.620 --> 03:49:12.639]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[03:49:12.799 --> 03:49:14.040]  It just goes on from there.
[03:49:14.600 --> 03:49:21.139]  So, theallocshowstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshowstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:23.479]  We're fighting the new world order.
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:25.379]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[03:49:25.559 --> 03:49:30.100]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:31.520]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:49:32.260 --> 03:49:33.239]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[03:49:33.799 --> 03:49:36.559]  It's up to you whether you want to back.
[03:49:37.219 --> 03:49:39.540]  The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:49:39.739 --> 03:49:48.860]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:56.100]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:49:56.239 --> 03:49:58.239]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[03:49:58.760 --> 03:50:01.200]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:50:01.659 --> 03:50:02.440]  We've already...
[03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:04.409]  Just devastated them.
[03:50:04.530 --> 03:50:07.569]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:09.129]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:13.430]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[03:50:13.829 --> 03:50:24.090]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:50:24.270 --> 03:50:25.889]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:50:26.010 --> 03:50:28.770]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:32.389]  I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:50:32.610 --> 03:50:34.829]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[03:50:34.989 --> 03:50:36.329]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[03:50:36.510 --> 03:50:45.030]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[03:50:45.250 --> 03:50:50.030]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[03:50:51.129 --> 03:50:53.389]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[03:50:55.049 --> 03:50:55.909]  I mean, it's just...
[03:50:55.909 --> 03:50:57.229]  This is a joke.
[03:50:57.549 --> 03:50:58.709]  This is ridiculous.
[03:50:59.190 --> 03:51:00.290]  We're changing the world.
[03:51:00.409 --> 03:51:03.250]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
