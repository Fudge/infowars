[00:00:59.-200 --> 00:00:15.280]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.839]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.311]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:23.894]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:29.597]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:36.299]  Well, I've interviewed a lot of amazing people.
[00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.781]  I've interviewed President Trump, you name it, and I never get butterflies.
[00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:42.143]  But for this interview, I do.
[00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:44.584]  I absolutely love Tucker Carlson.
[00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:45.645]  He's changed the world.
[00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:51.789]  He is the top political commentator in the world, hands down, and in his incredibly busy schedule.
[00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.832]  He has decided to give us about an hour and a half interview here today.
[00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:58.473]  And this is in the twilight of InfoWars.
[00:00:58.493 --> 00:00:59.934]  We could be imminently shut down.
[00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:05.318]  So I can't see us going out better than with Tucker Carlson also coming up today.
[00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:06.179]  It's how the planets aligned.
[00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.161]  Russell Brand is going to be on with us as well.
[00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.163]  So this is going to be an incredible broadcast here today.
[00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:13.664]  It will all be posted, obviously.
[00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:19.847]  At Real Alex Jones on X, but Tucker Carlson does not need any introduction.
[00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:42.416]   And I want to just talk to him first about the future of humanity, the future of America, World War III, the fact that the dinosaur media is officially dead and is trying to claw the rest of us with them, and how we turn not just American civilization, but the entire world civilization around from this globalist death cult that is In control of our lives today.
[00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:45.058]  So Tucker, thank you so much for the time, my friend.
[00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:49.142]  Of course, you've announced a big nationwide tour that I'm very proud to be a small part of.
[00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:50.383]  Just so much going on.
[00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.584]  Your network is exploding.
[00:01:52.604 --> 00:02:03.353]  I know you don't ever talk about Fox getting rid of you, but man, it's got to feel vindication and good that I would say you reach about 10 times more people now than when you were on Fox.
[00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.094]  So it's great to have you.
[00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:06.103]  Well, thank you.
[00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:07.524]  It actually felt good the first day.
[00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:14.331]  I enjoy being fired, actually, because it forces you to stop doing what you're doing and take an assessment.
[00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:15.332]  I'm honored to be here.
[00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:30.249]   I'm here, obviously, because we're friends, but I'm really here On principle, because there's nothing you've ever said in your entire life or done in your entire life that's scarier or more threatening to our country than what they're doing to you right now.
[00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:45.215]  So the government taking a broadcaster off the air who's committed no crime because he dares to criticize them is the scariest possible thing and it's the clearest possible sign of tyranny and I am heartbroken that this isn't getting more attention.
[00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:46.316]  I think it's a pivot point.
[00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:51.338]  In our country, and if they can do this to you, they will do it to the rest of us.
[00:02:51.638 --> 00:03:00.206]  And what's so striking, though, is that if you had spent the last 20 years attacking, I don't know, the white working class, right?
[00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:08.453]  Or the country, America, its founding documents, Thomas Jefferson, you know, you'd be lauded.
[00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:11.896]  But you did the one thing you're not allowed to do, which is you attack the people in charge.
[00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.412]  And that's why they're trying to take you off the air.
[00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:18.653]  And I think we should be really clear about that.
[00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:23.795]  You've never done anything but attack the people in charge.
[00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:25.196]  That's your crime.
[00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:29.217]  By the way, if you had started a war that killed a million people or tanked the U.S.
[00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:37.800]  economy or, you know, sort of looted every American's bank account through the Federal Reserve, you would be getting a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:44.004]   But you criticized the ruling oligarchy, and they're trying to crush you.
[00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:49.164]   So I hope every person of principle, every decent person in this country,
[00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:53.764]   whether they agree with what you say or not, whether they like you personally or not, it doesn't matter,
[00:03:53.764 --> 00:03:58.384]   will say out loud, "No, you can't do this in my country, "the country that my ancestors built that I was born in.
[00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:02.584]   "You can't take people off the air "because they criticize you because that's tyranny."
[00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:07.004]   Well, I wanna just thank you because when I first got deplatformed five years ago,
[00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:12.204]   almost no one who was prominent came to my aid and said, "Hey, they're gonna get everybody
[00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:13.164]  "if we allow this to happen."
[00:04:13.164 --> 00:04:15.084]  And they obviously misrepresented what I supposedly did.
[00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.644]  It was all a big PR campaign.
[00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:17.564]  They've now admitted to that.
[00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:20.844]   They've admitted in Reuters last week that the goal was to take me off air.
[00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:21.865]  They never wanted to settle with me.
[00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:24.964]  It was basically a Democratic Party whipshot.
[00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:28.084]   But shifting gears out of me, I mean, I totally agree with you.
[00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:32.365]   This isn't about Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Donald Trump or Steve Bannon.
[00:04:32.365 --> 00:04:35.605]   It's about, they have to get through us to get to the public, as Trump always says.
[00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:40.084]   And it really is a canary in the coal mine that they're so hysterical and so desperate
[00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:49.358]   and know that they've lost control of the narrative The lawfare, all the fake charges, all the criminality, and I want to speak to all of that, but you never really talk about yourself, and people find that fascinating.
[00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:50.159]  People want to know about you.
[00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.980]  So let's go back to what you first said.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.941]  You loved being fired.
[00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:59.764]   I mean, when I said ten times bigger than you were, You were huge, but you're definitely 10 times conservatively bigger.
[00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:03.565]  You're reaching 500, sometimes 700 million people with your shows.
[00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:04.645]  Normal shows, 50 million.
[00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.645]  I mean, that is massive.
[00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:10.366]  Instinctively, when you got unceremoniously fired at Fox, they wouldn't even tell you why.
[00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:11.787]  Very Kafkaesque.
[00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.607]  Why was that so exciting to you?
[00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:17.828]  And now, what is it like to be fully the captain of your ship?
[00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.967]  Well, I mean, of course it's painful.
[00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:30.861]  You know, it's always painful to, you know, have anything unexpected happen in your life because you think, you know, you can see the future, but it's really a blessing to be reminded that you can't.
[00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:33.288]  And that things changed abruptly.
[00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:36.129]  You don't have control, really, over most of your life.
[00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.571]  And you certainly don't have control over history.
[00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:43.333]  So, you're just sort of flotsam, bobbing along, trying to make the right decisions moment to moment.
[00:05:43.773 --> 00:05:50.297]  The reason that I liked being fired, within like 20 minutes I was in a good mood, because I recognized the pattern.
[00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.078]  It's always the bad things that turn out to be the greatest things in your life.
[00:05:53.718 --> 00:05:55.599]  You know, it's getting really sick and surviving.
[00:05:57.082 --> 00:06:05.429]  You know, it's something you didn't expect at all that hurts, that forces you to take an assessment of what you're doing and change.
[00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.332]  And you won't change unless that happens.
[00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:13.315]  I mean there's really nothing worse for people, particularly for men, than just succeeding.
[00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:15.977]  Because it ratifies all of your decisions.
[00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:18.998]  It makes you, you know, after a while, you just like confuse yourself for Jesus.
[00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:20.999]  You just think, well, I'm successful because I'm just so great.
[00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:21.899]  You know, I earned this.
[00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.480]  I'm like, I'm an amazing person, unlike everybody else.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.802]  And I think it's absolutely vital for your soul, but also for your clear judgment to remember no.
[00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:36.077]  I'm this sort of ungainly, ridiculous primate who lucked into some things, made some good decisions, a lot of bad decisions.
[00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:37.278]  Like, see yourself in context.
[00:06:37.298 --> 00:06:38.358]  See yourself as you really are.
[00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.599]  You know, you're absurd.
[00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.700]  We're all absurd.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.942]  And so getting fired just reminds you, like, oh, I'm so important!
[00:06:47.202 --> 00:06:49.603]  You know, I get all these people texting me, like, I can't believe they fired you.
[00:06:50.003 --> 00:06:50.683]  They needed you.
[00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:51.924]  Well, it turned out they didn't, actually.
[00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:56.907]  It's good to be reminded of that.
[00:06:56.947 --> 00:06:58.088]  You think you're such a big deal?
[00:06:58.368 --> 00:07:00.469]  Will anyone remember your name in 50 years?
[00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.329]  In 10 years?
[00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.630]  Will anyone visit your grave?
[00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.271]  I know the answer.
[00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:03.671]  No!
[00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:08.974]  So, I'm not saying that to pose as a self-deprecating person.
[00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:15.018]  I'm saying that because it's factually true and it's good to operate on the basis of what's true rather than on what you wish were true.
[00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:18.188]  Well, I mean, as I've grown up, I'm 50 now.
[00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:22.292]  I was never ego-driven completely, but I was more ego-driven as I was younger.
[00:07:22.793 --> 00:07:31.761]  It's such a strength and way more satisfying to have the ego basically drop away to almost nothing and to really have it be a sense of community.
[00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:39.188]  And that's your power that comes off so genuine, and it's even stronger in person, folks, is that you really are a genuine person who's humble.
[00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:41.470]  And so we're not lauding ourselves.
[00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:42.552]  It's just a great attribute.
[00:07:42.872 --> 00:07:47.438]  If you look at the globalists in DC, which I know you know well, they are the complete opposite.
[00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:49.701]  They are on delusional, crazy power trips.
[00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:57.391]  And to me, there's nothing more dangerous than that with people that are megalomaniacs and think they're invincible who also have nuclear weapons.
[00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.111]  Exactly.
[00:07:59.232 --> 00:08:03.901]  There's nothing... Really, that's the way that people destroy themselves.
[00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:08.009]  I mean, humans are distinct from the animal kingdom in one meaningful way.
[00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.032]  They kill themselves.
[00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:09.573]  Animals don't.
[00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:13.288]  You know, no dog has ever decided to kill himself.
[00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:17.072]  It just never occurs to a dog, or to a porcupine, or to any other animal.
[00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:18.493]  Only to people.
[00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:21.836]  And they always kill themselves in the same way, by imagining they have powers.
[00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.157]  They don't, mistaking themselves for God.
[00:08:23.638 --> 00:08:26.020]  And, I mean, this is just the most consistent theme in all history.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.183]  And again, men are prey to it in a way that women generally aren't.
[00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:31.325]  Obviously, Tori and Newlin would be a huge exception.
[00:08:31.365 --> 00:08:31.845]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:32.726]  I mean, there are exceptions.
[00:08:33.707 --> 00:08:37.849]  The male temperament is particularly susceptible to the delusion that, you know, I'm Jesus.
[00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:47.094]  And those people are the most dangerous, and you're right, when they have the power to destroy the world, which they do, you know, they're terrifying.
[00:08:47.354 --> 00:08:51.576]  And we are, by the way, just since you brought it up, we are on the cusp of nuclear war with Russia right now.
[00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:53.237]  We are actually on the cusp.
[00:08:53.277 --> 00:08:56.338]  We are closer to nuclear war right now than any time in history.
[00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.679]  Far closer than the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.760]  And the reason is really simple.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:08.345]   We're targeting Mainland Russia, we are attacking Russia, the nation we're at in a hot war with Russia.
[00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:17.756]  So from Putin's perspective, which is basically unknown in the United States, and they're completely committed to preventing you from knowing what Putin thinks or says.
[00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:23.145]   But if you pay any attention, all you know that Putin He is dictatorial, of course.
[00:09:23.665 --> 00:09:25.425]  He is not an absolute monarch.
[00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:27.286]  He is not Kim Jong-un.
[00:09:27.746 --> 00:09:30.747]  Putin cares a lot about his approval rating in Russia.
[00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:31.167]  A lot.
[00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:32.528]  That's why he controls the media in Russia.
[00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:40.891]  And Putin has, for two and a half years, done everything he can to minimize news within Russia of attacks within Russia.
[00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:45.913]  There have been a bunch of assassinations, for example, in Moscow, carried out by the Ukrainian intel services.
[00:09:46.733 --> 00:09:48.334]  That's a fact, okay?
[00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:51.295]  Dugan's daughter was murdered with a car bomb in Moscow.
[00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:51.815]  There have been others.
[00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:54.776]  And Russian media has ignored those attacks.
[00:09:55.196 --> 00:10:00.559]  Putin does not want to seem weak in front of his country, in front of the Russian people, period.
[00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:07.782]  And so my point is, Russian media, if you watch it, has been downplaying NATO attacks on Russia.
[00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:16.025]  If there is a NATO attack within Russia that he cannot keep from his people, it becomes obvious that he can't protect mainland Russia from NATO.
[00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:18.799]  He'll launch a tactical nuke into Ukraine.
[00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.140]  A nuclear weapon into Ukraine for the first time in 79 years.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.601]  We are very, very, very close to that.
[00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:30.764]  And if that happens, of course, it'll set off a chain reaction and we'll have a nuclear war in which you and I and our children will die.
[00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:33.889]  And so we're right there, right now.
[00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:37.271]  And that's not reported anywhere in the US media.
[00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:41.414]  Our leaders either know it and don't care because they're on a suicide trip.
[00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.435]  I agree with you, I think.
[00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:49.000]  But the average person is not bent on suicide, doesn't want to die, doesn't want his kids to be incinerated, doesn't want to live in a post-nuclear wasteland.
[00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:53.083]  And the average person has no idea that that's happening right now.
[00:10:53.884 --> 00:10:56.546]  And I just think it's the most astounding thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:01.874]  And if you add to that, Biden not knowing what planet he's on.
[00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.417]  And for people that don't know, you've studied this.
[00:11:03.777 --> 00:11:04.799]  Your guests have studied this.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.245]  Mainline analysts agree we're the closest nuclear world we've ever been.
[00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:15.850]  We have an establishment that has this normalcy bias that they're invincible or that Russia will back down.
[00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.391]  You're absolutely right.
[00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:21.852]  Putin, for those that don't study the situation, is a moderate and is restraining the hardliners.
[00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:25.373]  And the vast majority of Russians, over 80%, want full-out war.
[00:11:25.733 --> 00:11:34.276]  And people that don't know, Hitler went to be defeated in Russia, Napoleon, the Russians were the frontier with the East and stopped all these Mongol and then Islamic invasions.
[00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:39.017]  And so the Russians are very serious when it comes to being attacked and they will attack.
[00:11:39.897 --> 00:11:47.721]  And so this is not like some, you know, Iraq where we've cut off the resources and are, you know, murdering them with starvation and they can't fight back.
[00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:52.223]  This is the largest nuclear power and this is beyond playing with fire or poking a bear.
[00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:56.365]  I was texting you a few weeks ago and I said, yeah, it's World War III and you said...
[00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:00.767]  It's the final war, and I think that term, I hadn't heard that before, it's right.
[00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:18.114]  We had World War I that was the war to end all wars, we learned it wasn't, but this would be the final war as your very famous quantum mechanics expert once said, I don't know how World War III will be fought, but I know that World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[00:12:19.835 --> 00:12:20.195]  That's right.
[00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.452]  I think that's absolutely right.
[00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:27.260]  And the funny thing is that you and I grew up in a country where that was a commonplace observation, like all through school.
[00:12:27.961 --> 00:12:34.205]   You know, our entire lives up until about 25 years ago when The United States became the unipolar power.
[00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:40.811]  We were told, and it was true, that nuclear war was the end of humanity, and it was the thing to fear most.
[00:12:41.272 --> 00:12:55.146]   And all of a sudden, it became this thing that the entire foreign policy establishment in Washington, CSIS, and everyone in the National Security Council, and just sort of the permanent Foreign policy thinkers in D.C.
[00:12:55.587 --> 00:13:09.253]  wave away as, you know, not possible, whatever, you're being hysterical, even as they tell us that Vladimir Putin is dying of Parkinson's disease, is deranged, is a crazed megalomaniac on a death trip.
[00:13:09.673 --> 00:13:11.193]  You know, we can't he cannot be trusted.
[00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:14.155]  You cannot have a negotiation with him because he's that crazy.
[00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:22.181]  They're saying that this guy, who's by their own description that crazy, will not launch any of his 6,000 nuclear warheads against the West.
[00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:57.487]   I mean, it's the villain in this story, whatever you think of Putin, and I'm hardly defending Putin, but the villain here is NATO and the National Security Council in Washington, because they are pushing Our country and the West to annihilation and that that's a fact that's not I'm not being you know hysterical or trying to you know up play it or sell it you know as a threat that we shall be worried about this isn't an imminent danger to human existence and we're at the most fraught moment in all of human history right now.
[00:13:59.263 --> 00:14:14.652]  It's shocking to me that the Today Show and Good Morning America and the New York Times and the Washington Post don't begin every story no matter what the topic with, you know, by the way, we're on the cusp of nuclear war.
[00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:17.274]  Because there's nothing more important than that.
[00:14:18.407 --> 00:14:18.747]  But they don't.
[00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:19.708]  They hide it.
[00:14:19.908 --> 00:14:21.249]  And by the way, you say one more thing.
[00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.752]  You're very gracious when I've been on your show and just let me go on for 20 minutes of time.
[00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:26.614]  We want the deep Tucker Carlson.
[00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:27.995]  People love the Joe Rogan.
[00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:30.217]  One of the most viewed interviews ever.
[00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:31.598]  I've seen 100 million views, folks.
[00:14:31.858 --> 00:14:32.579]  I've watched it twice.
[00:14:32.619 --> 00:14:33.540]  My wife watched it twice.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.240]  My full family.
[00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:35.722]  Everybody I know has been talking about it.
[00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:37.443]  And Joe's great.
[00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:38.584]  He's better than I am at interrupting.
[00:14:38.604 --> 00:14:39.665]  But I want to be even better than Joe.
[00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:43.748]  I want to give you time to keep elaborating on this because you've really done a lot of research into this.
[00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:46.411]  And I want to get back into the suicide death cult.
[00:14:47.131 --> 00:15:14.836]  Nature of the globalist, and why they're so nihilistic, why they're doing this, and how they see a nuclear war as some survivable thing for them, that'll get rid of the population, and they'll re-emerge, and the Wall Street Journal, even with headlines, looking forward to the end of humanity, and just hundreds of headlines about humans are a parasite, let's get rid of them, and then the horrible sick things they do, like this is really, at the end of the day, a spiritual battle, and you've talked some about that in your guest tab, and I want you to really go deep on this today.
[00:15:16.246 --> 00:15:21.870]  Well, I mean, I think the framework that most of us internalized growing up in this country was evolutionary biology.
[00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:31.357]  The idea that human behavior is the product of millions of years of adaptation to the environment, and we like things, we don't like things, because our ancestors had a need to like or dislike those things.
[00:15:31.637 --> 00:15:33.399]  And it makes sense, and I think to some extent it's true.
[00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:40.147]  But the bottom line imperative in evolutionary biology is survival.
[00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:46.353]  You know, the whole point of existence is to pass on your genes to another generation and, you know, continue the line of humanity.
[00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.092]  So, and I think that's right, actually.
[00:15:49.112 --> 00:15:50.312]  I think that is our instinct.
[00:15:50.793 --> 00:16:02.842]  So whenever you see people who are pushing for the end of humanity, pushing for suicide, you know that the controlling power is, by definition, not human.
[00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:06.825]  That's my, I'm trying to approach this logically here, like, what are we watching?
[00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:13.748]  And I don't think that we're watching the product of human greed here, for example.
[00:16:13.988 --> 00:16:24.572]  And a lot of people, and I've been one of them many, many times, say, well, you know, the real story here, you know, the real reason this is happening is because Larry Fink is going to buy all the farmland in Ukraine and he's going to make a ton of money for BlackRock.
[00:16:24.732 --> 00:16:37.016]   Or the reason, you know, We have so many transvestite children is because the, you know, hormone makers are making a bundle on this, or the reason they're pushing the COVID vax is because Moderna and Pfizer are getting rich.
[00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:42.577]  I mean, on one level, that is all true, of course, but it's not what's driving it.
[00:16:43.518 --> 00:16:45.318]  No one is going to survive a nuclear exchange.
[00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:51.620]  The people who are pushing us, no one on the National Security Council is going to have a better life if there's a nuclear war.
[00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:55.616]  Everything that they know and love will be gone, including their own children.
[00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:59.760]  So this is not actually something they're doing for their own benefit, whether they know it or not.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.822]  They're being driven to do it by spiritual forces.
[00:17:03.142 --> 00:17:11.990]  I mean, I don't, I mean, if there's another explanation, by the way, I'm completely comfortable having grown up a secular person in a secular country with a secular explanation for what we're watching.
[00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.992]  If you could think of one, tell me what it is, but I can't.
[00:17:14.648 --> 00:17:16.951]  I don't see any rational reason.
[00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:22.237]  I don't see any actual self-interest that could be motivating the desire to commit mass suicide.
[00:17:22.257 --> 00:17:22.958]  I just don't.
[00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:29.626]  And I would, by the way, say that the transgender, the tranny stuff, is a form of mass suicide.
[00:17:29.646 --> 00:17:33.070]  You're preventing your children from having children, therefore you go extinct.
[00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.371]  I mean, right?
[00:17:34.451 --> 00:17:35.812]  At scale, that's what we're watching.
[00:17:35.832 --> 00:17:41.036]  Having our sons cut their genitals off and little girls cut their breasts off, it's like something out of a Clive Barker novel.
[00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:42.798]  It's like Hellraiser.
[00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:44.839]  So let's bring in all the politics.
[00:17:44.879 --> 00:17:48.142]  Can I just say, it's not just hurting your children, it's hurting you.
[00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:51.865]  Because the deepest desire of every parent is to have grandchildren.
[00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:54.647]  Not just for sentimental reasons, but for biological reasons.
[00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:56.329]  To see your line continue.
[00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.030]  That is the most natural of all instincts.
[00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:06.752]   So when you see somebody, Act against that, then you know this is probably not a human impulse.
[00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:07.532]  Right?
[00:18:07.552 --> 00:18:08.593]  This is unnatural.
[00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:11.255]  This is, in fact, I would say, supernatural.
[00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:14.278]  And that's exactly, in my view, what it is.
[00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:21.383]  Unless you can think of some better secular explanation that we can, you know, measure in the lab.
[00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:22.184]  But I can't.
[00:18:22.023 --> 00:18:32.507]   and I've thought about it a lot what did he just say He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:37.952]  I know.
[00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:43.117]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:46.059]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:53.740]  at RealAlexJones on X.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.740]  When you visit DrJonesNaturals.com, you'll find amazing Brain Boost Neutropics like Top Brain.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.740]  In fact, the top brain is the one that's going to help you get the most out of your life.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.740]  utropics like top ring.
[00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:10.512]  It's incredible.
[00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:18.362]  But it still uses classical systems to stimulate the neurons in the brain and to give you energy.
[00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:21.325]  Next level foundational energy does not do that.
[00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:30.492]  It is the breakdown of folic acid into methylfolate mixed with other natural compounds that are known to push it into the cells.
[00:19:30.912 --> 00:19:35.335]  It cleans up the mitochondria and allows more energy to be brought into the cell.
[00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:44.417]   You will feel dramatic energy when you take next level foundational energy with no letdown. But if you are a European or Northern European,
[00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:50.978]  most of us have partially broken genes and cannot absorb folic acid or process it properly.
[00:19:50.978 --> 00:20:01.298]   If you have broken genes, you are going to feel explosive energy. So be very, very, very careful when you first get next level foundational energy.
[00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:02.712]  It funds the operation.
[00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.053]  It's an amazing product.
[00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:05.814]  Everybody should experience it.
[00:20:06.294 --> 00:20:11.477]  It's discounted now, right now, and exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com.

[00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:23.945]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and encourage all of you to visit drjonesnaturals.com right now.
[00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:28.879]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones, here on X.
[00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:39.359]   I've heard you talk about this some, but can you elaborate on, growing up Episcopalian, you were never Satanist, you kind of believed in God from what I've heard, but weren't sure
[00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:46.359]   about it and liked the idea of Christianity, but then you've told me some of your private stories and told me some of mine, we're not going to get into those here, but the process
[00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:59.063]   of you in the last four or five years, really communicating what everybody else is feeling Either you're totally in the Matrix and don't see any of it, and do whatever you're told, and you will lick the bugs and, you know, love all this evil, and that's a smaller and smaller group.
[00:20:59.744 --> 00:21:03.965]  Or there's the majority of us, really, that don't have all the answers but are trying to figure this out.
[00:21:04.485 --> 00:21:10.628]  What was that process like for you coming to this realization that it's good versus evil and that there are forces other than human?
[00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:14.776]  Well, I mean, it's a process still.
[00:21:14.996 --> 00:21:26.239]  And by the way, one of the reasons I'm uncomfortable talking about it is because I hate to sort of hold myself up as an advertisement for the world's largest faith or pretend to be a spokesman for God.
[00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:29.520]  I think you bring disaster upon yourself when you do that, I've noticed.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.663]  I mean, there's a reason that preachers are disproportionately likely to get caught up in sex scandals or get addicted to porn or smoke meth.
[00:21:37.303 --> 00:21:38.143]  They're under attack.
[00:21:38.183 --> 00:21:58.483]   The second you say, I represent a billion Christians, You were under attack and so I I certainly don't represent a billion Christians or Christianity or Jesus or anything like that I'm as flawed as anybody you'll ever meet more than most and so I just want to say that with sincerity at the outset but to answer your question you know I always believed that the sum total of
[00:21:59.326 --> 00:22:01.567]  Everything was probably a little bit bigger than what we could measure.
[00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:03.888]  You know, that our senses don't tell the whole story.
[00:22:03.908 --> 00:22:10.791]  And I've always believed in the possibility of a god of supernatural forces because it seemed obvious to me.
[00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:13.493]  And it's obvious from your own experience in life.
[00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.114]  You somehow know things intuitively.
[00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:15.994]  Well, how could you know that?
[00:22:16.614 --> 00:22:18.315]  You know, it's encoded in our genes.
[00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:19.676]  Really tell me how that works exactly.
[00:22:19.696 --> 00:22:20.116]  You can't.
[00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:20.756]  Nobody can.
[00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:28.260]  So clearly there's a lot more going on than science, as understood in 2024, can explain to us, obviously.
[00:22:29.151 --> 00:22:32.073]  And I've always assumed that that was real because it clearly is real.
[00:22:32.593 --> 00:22:36.435]  But I didn't have much of a coherent theology other than, you know, I'm a Christian.
[00:22:36.475 --> 00:22:39.856]  I went to sort of a church that didn't mean it.
[00:22:40.197 --> 00:22:41.957]  I didn't quite realize how much they didn't mean it.
[00:22:42.478 --> 00:22:44.479]  But I'd grown up in this church and gone to its schools.
[00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:47.920]  And I was really steeped in the culture of the church.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.042]  And my family was involved in the church going back, you know, a couple hundred years.
[00:22:51.102 --> 00:22:53.043]  So it was like it was very much part of our family.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.240]  And, um, but I didn't think about it very much.
[00:22:56.421 --> 00:23:00.061]  And really it was watching what's happening to the world that changed my view.
[00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:05.742]  I became convinced that some of these, I had watched political debates my entire life.
[00:23:05.782 --> 00:23:08.783]  That's what I do for 30, more than 30 years.
[00:23:09.183 --> 00:23:13.324]  And while I disagreed with one side, I could understand their argument.
[00:23:13.564 --> 00:23:18.825]  You know, they would say, well, we need to have, I mean, I've always been totally opposed to abortion or killing the defenseless.
[00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:22.147]  Really killing anybody, honestly, except in self-defense.
[00:23:22.207 --> 00:23:27.753]  But, um, but I could understand, you know, well, there's a 15-year-old girl who, you know, was pregnant.
[00:23:27.853 --> 00:23:28.614]  She got raped.
[00:23:28.754 --> 00:23:31.877]  And if you don't let her have an abortion, she'll never have a real life.
[00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:37.021]  And, you know, I disagreed with that because I think you can't kill people regardless of the justification.
[00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.264]  However, I thought that was a real argument.
[00:23:39.524 --> 00:23:42.847]  I mean, at least it appealed to the possibility her life would be improved.
[00:23:43.638 --> 00:23:48.186]  You wake up and all of a sudden people are saying, well, abortion is itself the point.
[00:23:48.607 --> 00:23:51.572]  Like having an abortion is just good for the sake of doing it.
[00:23:52.213 --> 00:23:52.454]  That's right.
[00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:53.696]  The women say, we love it.
[00:23:53.936 --> 00:23:54.718]  They say, we love it.
[00:23:54.758 --> 00:23:55.379]  It's a religion.
[00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:56.361]  They're getting off on it.
[00:23:57.597 --> 00:23:58.838]  Well, it's human sacrifice.
[00:23:59.758 --> 00:24:00.939]  And so, obviously.
[00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:07.543]  So I was trying, because I'm a little bit autistic and very literal, I'm thinking, well, okay, what does that even mean?
[00:24:07.563 --> 00:24:08.104]  Like, what?
[00:24:08.344 --> 00:24:09.064]  You were trying to find logic.
[00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:09.905]  This is very different.
[00:24:10.505 --> 00:24:10.925]  I was!
[00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:14.908]  And I'm a student of argument, because I make arguments for a living.
[00:24:14.948 --> 00:24:19.731]  I spent years, you know, sending my kids to school and filling the fridge with arguing.
[00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:21.052]  That's what I did for a living.
[00:24:21.072 --> 00:24:40.215]   So I really I'm interested in how people construct arguments and in their nature and all of a sudden people stop making arguments on behalf of abortion and begin holding it up as just like something that was just good for its own sake and and stop they didn't even attempt to convince you that you weren't taking a human life the presumption is that you are of course and with technology we know that you are
[00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:41.956]  There's no counter-argument to that.
[00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:45.858]  And so they're basically saying killing people is a good thing.
[00:24:45.898 --> 00:24:48.419]  And I thought, well, that's just a kind of remarkable thing to say.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.923]  And then I found out, because I was interested, that that is what every society has said in recorded history.
[00:24:55.223 --> 00:25:07.730]  Every society, from the ones that, you know, are very famous, the ancient Canaanites, the Mayans, the Aztecs, all the Mesoamerican civilizations, but also the Western European civilizations, my own, where my ancestors lived, you know, in the Nordic countries.
[00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.072]   They were also committing human sacrifice.
[00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:20.664]  There's something about killing other people ritually as an offering to the spirit world that is a constant through human history.
[00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:22.286]  Every civilization has done that.
[00:25:22.907 --> 00:25:24.509]  And so that raises the question, why?
[00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:28.213]  How would, like, that's such a counterintuitive conclusion to come to.
[00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:53.800]   I kill people like so evolutionary biology tells us that the whole point of existence is to continue existence is to pass on your genes to another generation and then many more right that that's the assumption that I have my whole life and yet every civilization from the beginning of time has reached the opposite conclusion we will be happier by killing the fruit of our womb children And we will be rewarded by the gods for doing this.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.282]  Every single civilization has reached that conclusion without any exception that I'm aware of.
[00:25:57.862 --> 00:25:59.063]  And you have to ask, why is that?
[00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:01.664]  They didn't have the internet 5,000 years ago.
[00:26:01.764 --> 00:26:03.826]  How are they all reaching the same conclusion?
[00:26:04.226 --> 00:26:07.888]  And really the only logical answer is because some outside force was telling them that.
[00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:08.629]  Right?
[00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:09.889]  That the spirit world is real.
[00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:21.785]   And that there are demons telling people that you will be happier, that you will be safer, that you will be richer, You'll be more powerful if you take the life of a child.
[00:26:23.007 --> 00:26:26.273]  Or of a maiden, or of some helpless human being.
[00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:28.378]  Uh, mostly young human beings.
[00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:36.820]  It's never the elderly who are the... And they like it because it's stealing the future and a child is the closest thing to God because of the potential of the universe, so it is a wound against God.
[00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:37.741]  It is stabbing God.
[00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:38.641]  Exactly!
[00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:39.441]  Exactly!
[00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:46.284]  But, so from, but, look, civilizations convince themselves of all kinds of crazy things, right?
[00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:54.026]   But when every civilization convinces itself of the same crazy thing, That is not an obvious conclusion.
[00:26:54.486 --> 00:27:02.148]  Like, if I'm, you know, a Hivero Indian living in the Amazon headwaters, and just getting enough calories every year is really a struggle, right?
[00:27:02.668 --> 00:27:11.950]  And I need labor, because there aren't many Hivero Indians, but I've somehow reached a conclusion that killing my own child would, you know, make my life better.
[00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.630]  Like, how am I reaching that conclusion?
[00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.010]  Like, I'm not reaching that rationally.
[00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.571]  Something or somebody is telling me that.
[00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:18.871]  And you made a key point.
[00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:19.751]  You made a key point.
[00:27:21.776 --> 00:27:25.019]  That these are civilizations that we're not communicating and they're doing the exact same thing.
[00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:25.459]  Exactly.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.443]  Many times the exact same image of the same gods.
[00:27:28.463 --> 00:27:29.944]  And so you've told me some private stories.
[00:27:29.984 --> 00:27:30.365]  So often.
[00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:32.006]  I've told you some private ones.
[00:27:32.807 --> 00:27:34.849]  And through my life I have a sixth sense to spirit.
[00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.171]  It's not instinct.
[00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:36.951]  It's something else.
[00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:38.433]  And I've had this happen all the time.
[00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:39.154]  I usually ignore it.
[00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:40.895]  I've learned to not ignore it.
[00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:45.705]  And I mean, here's just an example, and this is literally from the ether from God.
[00:27:46.246 --> 00:27:47.186]  I can play the clip.
[00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:51.050]  About a month before he got fired, I said, Tucker will be fired within one month.
[00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:54.234]  And I believe Tucker, he's hardcore, he's awake.
[00:27:55.074 --> 00:27:56.035]  The left admits it.
[00:27:56.696 --> 00:28:00.820]  I predict he won't be at Fox News in the near future if he's unable to put this out.
[00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:02.502]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:28:02.962 --> 00:28:05.545]  By the way, Fox News needs Tucker Carlson.
[00:28:08.192 --> 00:28:10.192]  Tucker Carlson doesn't need Fox News.
[00:28:10.192 --> 00:28:12.192]  We'll be back on Monday.
[00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:17.192]  Tucker Carlson signed off Friday on what we now know was his last show on Fox News.
[00:28:17.192 --> 00:28:23.192]  The network announcing it is severing ties with its most popular host without explanation in a statement Monday.
[00:28:23.192 --> 00:28:27.192]  And I've just learned when this stuff happens, I just say it and it's always right.
[00:28:27.192 --> 00:28:31.192]  And then now that I've accepted it, it's getting more intense and it's getting stronger.
[00:28:31.192 --> 00:28:38.192]  And I know what's going on is these dark forces don't want humans to go to the next level of real evolution.
[00:28:38.192 --> 00:28:40.192]  God's real evolution for us.
[00:28:40.073 --> 00:28:40.974]  And you hit that on the head.
[00:28:40.994 --> 00:28:41.234]  Yes.
[00:28:41.374 --> 00:28:42.594]  People see these fake churches.
[00:28:42.634 --> 00:28:50.496]  Well, Christ says in the New Testament, he spends the whole time criticizing the Pharisees and Sadducees and saying they pray in public, they act like they're God, they get in front of you in God.
[00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:54.397]  He's like, pray in private to God, open up your heart, the kingdom of heaven is with you.
[00:28:54.657 --> 00:29:03.397]   You're not God, but you are able to reach out directly, not through some priest, not through some preacher, but directly to God. It's great to go to church, there are other people that are looking for God,
[00:29:03.397 --> 00:29:10.438]   there's a psychic connection, it boosts it, but Satan is smart. He, one of the worst places is the churches because that's where he lays the traps.
[00:29:10.438 --> 00:29:24.597]   I think that's all true. And I just go back to what I said when we first sat down, which is, why have you been singled out for abuse and persecution? Why?
[00:29:24.851 --> 00:29:30.235]  And it, I'm just, like, I'm in the business of trying to figure out, usually unsuccessfully, but why things happen.
[00:29:30.275 --> 00:29:31.376]  It's not enough to say that they do.
[00:29:31.996 --> 00:29:34.938]  For me, anyway, my curiosity drives me to ask, like, why is this happening?
[00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:35.539]  What does this mean?
[00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:36.039]  What is this?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:50.150]  And the fact that you, specifically you, Alex Jones, for the last 20 years, have been attacked in the way that you have been, even when you're on, like, cable access television, like a threat to nobody.
[00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.712]  Why did they single you out?
[00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.013]  And of course, it's not because you're lying.
[00:29:54.213 --> 00:30:00.818]  In fact, had you lied and decided to make a career of lying, you would be a lot richer than you are and no one would bother you.
[00:30:00.878 --> 00:30:01.759]  You'd be celebrated.
[00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.020]  You'd have a show on NBC.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.944]  It's the fact that through you flows some things that are undeniably true.
[00:30:08.444 --> 00:30:09.945]  I mean, I can't vouch for all of it.
[00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:17.589]  I don't have your full, like, lifetime corpus in front of me, but I know that you predicted, in detail, 9-11 the summer before it happened.
[00:30:17.609 --> 00:30:18.689]  Like, that's just a fact.
[00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:22.271]  And I've thrown that out there many times, like, okay, you may hit Alex Jones.
[00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:25.226]  But what is that?
[00:30:25.366 --> 00:30:27.049]  Honestly, how did that happen?
[00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.031]  That's impossible.
[00:30:30.873 --> 00:30:31.434]  You know what I mean?
[00:30:31.474 --> 00:30:36.040]  So why don't you tell me, Alex Jones hater, what are we looking at here?
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.121]  How could he have known that?
[00:30:37.982 --> 00:30:40.705]  And the answer, of course, is that you couldn't have known that.
[00:30:41.246 --> 00:30:42.287]  That that's supernatural.
[00:30:42.327 --> 00:30:48.310]  Now I'm not saying everything you say is like prophecy from God, but I'm saying that's supernatural because I can't think of a natural explanation.
[00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:48.950]  Maybe there is one.
[00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.131]  If there is, tell me what it is!
[00:30:50.671 --> 00:30:51.671]  But that's why they hate you.
[00:30:52.172 --> 00:30:54.293]  So, um, that's revealing in itself.
[00:30:54.673 --> 00:30:56.694]  If you want to know, there it is right there.
[00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:05.917]  If July 25th, 2001, I lived in this country, I was in the news business on July 25th, 2001, I was an employee of the Cable News Network in Washington.
[00:31:06.277 --> 00:31:07.378]  I hosted a show for CNN.
[00:31:07.798 --> 00:31:15.520]  Trust me, we had every national security poobah on there, every retired CIA operative, some current CIA operatives, talking about this stuff all the time.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.422]  Not one person came within a mile of what you said on some cable access show in Texas.
[00:31:21.442 --> 00:31:21.942]  Like, what?
[00:31:22.942 --> 00:31:29.188]  So, that's the problem that they have, is that you blurt out these things that are true.
[00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:36.696]  And I just think, if you want to understand what's actually going on, take a look at what makes the people in charge the angriest.
[00:31:36.756 --> 00:31:38.037]  What are the things you can't say?
[00:31:38.357 --> 00:31:40.840]  And that's a pretty reliable guide to what's actually happening.
[00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:46.680]  So shifting gears away from me, what is it about Tucker Carlson that makes him so mad?
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:54.559]   Because you make a lot of predictions and accurate things, but you're even more strong and this is not an assassin contest, we're talking about why the enemy hates us because
[00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.559]  that's important to understand.
[00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.559]  What are we doing that can beat them?
[00:31:56.559 --> 00:32:00.859]   If they're trying to stop us, we've got something that can defeat them, so everybody needs to understand this.
[00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:01.859]  We need to understand this.
[00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:02.859]  What is it about you?
[00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:10.839]   I think it's that you are definitely genuine, very smart, articulate, and are able to reach Reach out across political lines and unify people.
[00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:13.035]  And all you're trying to do is save civilization and our future.
[00:32:13.055 --> 00:32:13.836]  They call you a hater.
[00:32:14.196 --> 00:32:15.137]  They call you an extremist.
[00:32:15.197 --> 00:32:24.523]  CNN and the usual suspects, Brian Stelter's mini-me, Oliver Darcy, is running around trying to get Ticketmaster to pull and shut down your tour.
[00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:26.604]  I mean, why are they so scared of you?
[00:32:29.674 --> 00:32:30.695]  I don't know if they are.
[00:32:32.137 --> 00:32:32.637]  It's funny.
[00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:33.678]  So many levels.
[00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:37.342]  But I would say, first, I don't have any kind of prophetic ability.
[00:32:37.362 --> 00:32:37.942]  I wish I did.
[00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:39.284]  Most of my predictions are wrong.
[00:32:39.664 --> 00:32:43.648]  Occasionally, I will get a really strong feeling about something, and those turn out to be right.
[00:32:44.008 --> 00:32:44.849]  But not that often.
[00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:48.152]  From the first day, I thought there was something wrong with the COVID vaccine.
[00:32:48.192 --> 00:32:49.073]  I didn't know what it was.
[00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:49.954]  I still don't really know.
[00:32:50.514 --> 00:32:53.557]  But I felt that very, very strongly, and I went with my instinct on that.
[00:32:54.531 --> 00:33:02.055]  Second example of that is the day the war in Ukraine started, I had an overwhelming feeling that this is a really, really big deal.
[00:33:02.095 --> 00:33:03.736]  It's not some regional war in Eastern Europe.
[00:33:04.236 --> 00:33:07.178]  This is the thing that resets civilization and potentially ends it.
[00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:08.398]  I really felt that strongly.
[00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:10.339]  And I think that turned out to be true.
[00:33:10.419 --> 00:33:13.001]  But most of the time, I don't have that ability.
[00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:13.761]  Again, I wish I did.
[00:33:14.882 --> 00:33:16.462]  I've never called an election correctly.
[00:33:16.502 --> 00:33:17.343]  I always get them wrong.
[00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.035]  I think the reason they don't like me is because I'm from that world.
[00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:24.177]  I really do think that's offensive to them.
[00:33:24.217 --> 00:33:28.923]  I mean, I'm not some mega insider or something, but I am actually from that world.
[00:33:28.963 --> 00:33:29.584]  I lived in D.C.
[00:33:29.604 --> 00:33:30.344]  for 35 years.
[00:33:30.404 --> 00:33:31.005]  I worked at CNN.
[00:33:31.025 --> 00:33:31.866]  I worked at MSNBC.
[00:33:32.187 --> 00:33:32.667]  I worked at PBS.
[00:33:32.727 --> 00:33:33.348]  I worked at ABC.
[00:33:34.449 --> 00:33:37.272]  I know everybody involved in that world.
[00:33:37.352 --> 00:33:39.234]  I know a lot of, you know, government officials.
[00:33:39.254 --> 00:33:41.756]  I just I was always a big booster of Washington.
[00:33:41.796 --> 00:33:43.778]  I didn't really criticize the system.
[00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:45.239]  I sort of believed in the system.
[00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:50.164]  I thought some things that you said were really dangerous and scary.
[00:33:50.304 --> 00:33:51.145]  I've apologized for that.
[00:33:51.165 --> 00:33:51.906]  Turns out you were right.
[00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:52.606]  I was wrong.
[00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:58.432]  But I really was kind of like I had my views and I was conservative, but basically I was a defender of the system.
[00:33:58.952 --> 00:34:11.276]  Because I thought it was worth defending, and it was only eight or nine years ago that I realized, wait, this is really dishonest and wrong, and a lot of the things that they're telling me are the mirror image of the truth.
[00:34:11.296 --> 00:34:14.116]  They're not just incorrect, they're an inversion.
[00:34:14.276 --> 00:34:15.637]  They're the opposite of the truth.
[00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:19.080]  Well, that's my next question and I'll elaborate, but before I forget it.
[00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:21.083]  So you talked about your spiritual awakening.
[00:34:21.984 --> 00:34:23.045]  What was your political awakening?
[00:34:23.065 --> 00:34:26.308]  Because I remember like 12 years ago, you were going to come on the show.
[00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:28.371]  You'd attack me and stuff, which I understood.
[00:34:28.391 --> 00:34:28.931]  It was genuine.
[00:34:29.132 --> 00:34:37.041]  You had real reasons for it, and I could get the things I was saying were so horrible that only a horrible person would say it when somebody is still projecting their own goodness onto things.
[00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:42.624]  So, but what was your, then, the last 12 years, your acceleration until now?
[00:34:42.704 --> 00:34:45.045]  I would say, I watch your show every day when you do them.
[00:34:45.245 --> 00:34:49.328]  I think you say things, most of the time, deeper than what anybody else is saying.
[00:34:49.508 --> 00:34:51.269]  I mean, it's true.
[00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.270]  So, what was the process of your awakening?
[00:34:54.811 --> 00:34:59.693]  Well, it's kind of hard to know because you don't see yourself clearly and I am totally lacking self-awareness.
[00:34:59.713 --> 00:35:02.895]  I mean, I can gain 50 pounds and not know it until my pants don't fit.
[00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:04.616]  Like, I'm not aware of myself very much.
[00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:05.957]  No, that's happened.
[00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:18.502]  But anyway, it's hard really to know, but I, you know, living in Washington in the same neighborhood for years, and I mean, I got there in high school.
[00:35:18.562 --> 00:35:19.503]  So I mean, I really did.
[00:35:19.903 --> 00:35:23.124]  I felt like I was part of the city and of its culture and life.
[00:35:23.364 --> 00:35:24.664]  And I did not feel like an outsider there.
[00:35:24.704 --> 00:35:25.925]  I felt like a part of it.
[00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:42.070]   And watching people I knew personally who I, you know, stood next to at soccer games, like at that level, lie and Sort of, rather than defend what they were doing, attack the person who questioned it.
[00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:51.561]  I found that so low, that was so shocking to me, to watch smart people become that defensive about what they were doing, that it opened up a chain reaction in my head.
[00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:57.127]  I was like, well, wait a second, if they can't defend something as simple as NATO, they couldn't defend, like, why do we have NATO?
[00:35:57.247 --> 00:35:57.808]  What's the answer?
[00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:01.889]  If you ask that question, they'll immediately call you a racist or a transphobe or whatever.
[00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:05.590]  They'll try to, you know, attack your character rather than answer the question.
[00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.491]  And just as a man, I felt that that was so disgusting.
[00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:10.711]  I mean, that's what children do.
[00:36:11.092 --> 00:36:12.332]  That's what drunk people do.
[00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:13.512]  That's what crazy people do.
[00:36:13.552 --> 00:36:16.453]  It's not what my Harvard-educated neighbors are supposed to be doing.
[00:36:16.493 --> 00:36:17.753]  We're running federal agencies.
[00:36:17.773 --> 00:36:21.454]  So when I saw that at the beginning of the Trump, it was really about Trump.
[00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:36.247]   I mean, it wasn't actually about Trump the man, You know, but it was about that moment in 2015-16 and I just thought, well, I have an obligation to see what I think is true and to keep pulling the thread.
[00:36:36.307 --> 00:36:41.452]  And that happened to be exactly the moment that I got a new job at Fox and had a bigger platform.
[00:36:41.492 --> 00:36:44.655]  And I just thought, you know, I don't know how long I'm going to have this, but I'm going to tell the truth.
[00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:50.219]  You know, with the knowledge I'm going to get it wrong often, which I of course do, but I'm not going to lie.
[00:36:50.379 --> 00:36:50.680]  Period.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.500]  I'm not going to lie.
[00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:53.042]  And let's just see where this goes.
[00:36:53.122 --> 00:37:05.673]  And the more, you know, the more I did try and tell the truth, just without any caveats at all, the bigger reaction I got, a negative reaction, like people really, really hated that.
[00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:09.496]  And then I just dug in and I thought to myself, I don't care what you do to me, actually.
[00:37:10.017 --> 00:37:11.098]  You know, my kids are grown.
[00:37:12.238 --> 00:37:14.079]  I just don't care at all.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.101]  And I'm just going to say what I think is true.
[00:37:16.121 --> 00:37:18.822]  And then the next thing you know, I'm just like, I can't live there anymore.
[00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:21.283]  Everyone hates me and I feel sad about that.
[00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:24.505]  But I think if you're not, because I actually had a million good friends in D.C.
[00:37:24.585 --> 00:37:25.366]  who were good people.
[00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:27.347]  I still think they're good people, but they've gone crazy.
[00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:29.988]  But it wasn't like you were leaving one place for a worse place.
[00:37:30.008 --> 00:37:32.010]  I've been to your place in Maine.
[00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.230]  It's like Valhalla.
[00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:41.656]  It's not a rich Valhalla, but it's more a working-class Valhalla.
[00:37:42.337 --> 00:37:47.698]  No, it's where I went in the summer anyway, so I thought... Well, see, I don't think of Valhalla as palaces or Versailles.
[00:37:47.958 --> 00:37:54.840]  I think of Valhalla as big, beautiful mountains coming out of crystal-clear lakes and rivers and trees and normal people.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.000]  Well, we have a lot of that.
[00:37:57.423 --> 00:38:01.085]  Well, and I do think this is like not even relevant, but it's just true.
[00:38:01.785 --> 00:38:04.226]  I really like to hunt and fish and camp and be in the woods.
[00:38:04.366 --> 00:38:06.227]  And that's, I've felt that way my entire life.
[00:38:06.287 --> 00:38:10.989]  Those are just important to me for some reason and always have been since I was a small child.
[00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:13.410]  And I think that made a huge difference.
[00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.952]  I think that if you appreciate nature, you don't have to be John Muir or, you know, live in a yurt.
[00:38:19.113 --> 00:38:27.262]   But I think Being around animals and trees and water and granite and pine needles and you know just flowers.
[00:38:27.302 --> 00:38:28.404]  That's God's cathedral!
[00:38:33.171 --> 00:38:34.052]  Well, I feel that way.
[00:38:34.192 --> 00:38:35.333]  I feel that way so strongly.
[00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:37.895]  I feel that way overwhelmingly, actually.
[00:38:37.935 --> 00:38:41.038]  In fact, I have to restrain myself because I don't want to be barged about it.
[00:38:41.338 --> 00:38:48.184]  But I feel, and dogs also, I feel in a way that's hard to explain, but that those things are really important.
[00:38:48.204 --> 00:38:50.286]  I think God speaks to us through them, I think.
[00:38:50.787 --> 00:38:56.111]  But even message aside, they're such enduring sources of joy.
[00:38:56.131 --> 00:39:08.613]   I mean, that's so much more powerful and Fulfilling for me to be in the woods with my dogs than it is to be sitting in front of a laptop, which I don't own, by the way.
[00:39:09.154 --> 00:39:14.039]  But even if I did own a laptop and had to sit in front of it, I would still yearn to be outside.
[00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:15.942]  And I feel like that does center you.
[00:39:15.962 --> 00:39:16.783]  And you don't need to.
[00:39:17.103 --> 00:39:20.807]  We live in the middle of like a million acre forest, but you don't have to.
[00:39:21.608 --> 00:39:22.910]  You know, you can go to the park.
[00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:31.780]  Anything that connects you with God's creation for just a moment every day is every bit as important as going to the gym and getting your cardio or whatever they call it.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.041]  It's way more important than that.
[00:39:33.081 --> 00:39:34.623]  It's spiritually essential.
[00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:40.251]  And you don't talk about yourself privately, but I said, man, you want to do a nature show, because I know Ted Nugent well.
[00:39:40.792 --> 00:39:41.412]  He's a great shot.
[00:39:41.432 --> 00:39:41.992]  He's amazing.
[00:39:42.492 --> 00:39:43.973]  But you're a real outdoorsman.
[00:39:43.993 --> 00:39:45.833]  I mean, you're sharpening the chainsaw.
[00:39:45.853 --> 00:39:47.134]  You're building the houses.
[00:39:47.694 --> 00:39:49.794]  You're driving the boats around in the rivers and lakes.
[00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:53.195]  You're skinning the bucks and running the trot lines of the bears.
[00:39:53.235 --> 00:39:53.936]  I mean, I've been with you.
[00:39:53.956 --> 00:39:56.036]  You're like really running around from hunting camp to hunting camp.
[00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:57.677]  The show is a side deal.
[00:39:58.317 --> 00:40:01.538]  And I could see, like, this is a real outdoorsman, like my grandfather or something.
[00:40:02.478 --> 00:40:06.244]  I hope you do some outdoor shows, because if people saw that side of you, they'd be blown away.
[00:40:08.247 --> 00:40:10.850]  Well, I've always thought that cameras were corrupting.
[00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.955]  I mean, we didn't have... That's what I picked up.
[00:40:13.995 --> 00:40:16.939]  This is your real life, so that's like private.
[00:40:18.857 --> 00:40:21.839]  Well, so I sort of feel, oh gosh, yeah, I sort of feel that way.
[00:40:21.899 --> 00:40:27.002]  I do think cameras are, I mean, the most intimate moments of your life should not be filmed.
[00:40:27.022 --> 00:40:37.249]  You know, the birth of your child, the conception of your child, you know, the best dinner party you ever had, you know, a drive with your son in the car where you talk about life.
[00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:40.951]  Like, these are not things that are, you know, being filmed for others.
[00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:48.235]   These are real moments that are lived out in real time and experienced You know, as they happen, not in retrospect.
[00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:48.995]  Well, that's what I said.
[00:40:49.035 --> 00:40:52.637]  I said, man, you're shooting these clays better than me and my military security detail.
[00:40:52.657 --> 00:40:53.197]  And we're good.
[00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:54.677]  And you're shooting bullseye.
[00:40:54.838 --> 00:40:56.178]  You're like, you're like Annie Oakley.
[00:40:56.218 --> 00:40:56.718]  But a guy.
[00:40:56.738 --> 00:40:57.578]  It's my range.
[00:40:58.479 --> 00:41:00.299]  But I was like, you got to show people.
[00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:01.480]  No, don't videotape me.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.680]  Don't videotape me doing this.
[00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:04.321]  I'm like, OK, John Wayne.
[00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:05.141]  No, I don't.
[00:41:05.602 --> 00:41:07.223]  No, because you want it to be real.
[00:41:07.263 --> 00:41:08.685]  I mean, that is a problem.
[00:41:08.705 --> 00:41:11.707]  Look, I'll just say it out, you know, out front.
[00:41:11.948 --> 00:41:13.609]  I am not for technology.
[00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:16.051]  And I think I go too far on that.
[00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:18.594]  I think it's almost like an eccentricity.
[00:41:19.034 --> 00:41:19.835]  But I don't like it.
[00:41:20.195 --> 00:41:21.076]  And I just don't like it.
[00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.377]  And that's how I feel.
[00:41:22.858 --> 00:41:24.319]  Technology makes my life possible.
[00:41:24.339 --> 00:41:25.540]  It makes my job possible.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.701]  It feeds my children.
[00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:28.263]  I mean, there's a lot of technology that's good.
[00:41:28.943 --> 00:41:31.005]  I don't want to have to wash laundry by hand.
[00:41:31.045 --> 00:41:31.986]  I like washing machines.
[00:41:32.026 --> 00:41:34.088]  I mean, there are lots of things about technology that are good.
[00:41:34.468 --> 00:41:39.993]  But in my personal life, I really try to limit its use and limit the use of electricity.
[00:41:40.053 --> 00:41:40.854]  I just don't like it.
[00:41:41.194 --> 00:41:41.874]  That's how I feel.
[00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:43.116]  I can't quite explain it.
[00:41:43.796 --> 00:41:45.798]  But no, I feel that way really, really strongly.
[00:41:45.978 --> 00:41:50.542]  And I just prefer to be in a place without it, if I can.
[00:41:50.622 --> 00:41:51.443]  Most of the time I can't.
[00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:54.526]  I hear I'm talking to you on some ISDN line, whatever that is.
[00:41:55.326 --> 00:41:55.907]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:55.927 --> 00:42:00.990]  But I think getting a respite from that is important because it restores perspective.
[00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:10.276]  And if you have the chance to, you know, use a candle instead of an electric light or use an outhouse instead of a flush toilet once in a while, I think it's good for you.
[00:42:10.496 --> 00:42:10.997]  I do think that.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.205]  I don't believe in mail bombs.
[00:42:19.225 --> 00:42:20.186]  I don't believe in hurting people.
[00:42:20.206 --> 00:42:22.568]  I think Ted Kaczynski was insane obviously for doing that.
[00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:29.604]   But Ted Kaczynski's analysis of technology, even if you don't buy it completely, and I don't buy it completely, But it's worth hearing.
[00:42:29.744 --> 00:42:30.465]  It's worth thinking about.
[00:42:30.505 --> 00:42:40.507]  There should be some counterbalance to the propaganda from Google and the power company that we'd all be nothing without, you know, electricity and microchips.
[00:42:40.527 --> 00:42:42.208]  Like, that's not true, actually.
[00:42:42.228 --> 00:42:42.988]  That's a lie.
[00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:44.688]  And we should say it out loud.
[00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:45.269]  It's a lie.
[00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:57.352]  And I also think, honestly, that technology can be, while life-saving, you know, if my child had a medical problem, I would hope he went to a doctor, you know, who had access to electricity and machines and all that.
[00:42:57.372 --> 00:42:57.612]  It's great.
[00:42:58.192 --> 00:43:02.174]  But it can also be, this is just a fact, a vector for evil.
[00:43:02.194 --> 00:43:03.834]  Okay, that's just true.
[00:43:04.034 --> 00:43:05.415]  And somebody needs to say that.
[00:43:06.055 --> 00:43:11.117]  And I don't know why that's considered crazy or, you know, I don't know, radical to say that.
[00:43:11.157 --> 00:43:12.858]  I'm an incredibly moderate person.
[00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:14.839]  I'm a moderate person by my temperament.
[00:43:14.939 --> 00:43:16.600]  I don't like radicalism at all.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.301]  It's clear that we're way out of balance is what you're saying.
[00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:21.252]  Way out of balance.
[00:43:21.412 --> 00:43:22.293]  Way out of balance.
[00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.035]  And I feel that way about so many things.
[00:43:25.195 --> 00:43:32.461]  I think people who, you know, you want to build a business, you have to take debt in order to expand the business.
[00:43:32.681 --> 00:43:33.301]  I get that.
[00:43:33.942 --> 00:43:48.433]   But the idea that we're sending credit cards to college students and hooking them on Debt at 28% interest and nobody knows the names of the credit card executives who are getting rich from the suffering of hundreds of millions of Americans is shocking to me.
[00:43:48.753 --> 00:43:51.656]  Instead, we all hate Alex Jones because he's got naughty opinions.
[00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:52.056]  Really?
[00:43:52.456 --> 00:44:01.163]  What about the head of Citibank, who is hooking our entire country on credit cards and sending people into lifetime debt slavery?
[00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:02.725]  Oh, shut up!
[00:44:03.085 --> 00:44:03.966]  No, you shut up.
[00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:05.066]  You shut up.
[00:44:05.086 --> 00:44:06.287]  You're hooking people on debt.
[00:44:06.327 --> 00:44:06.808]  You're evil.
[00:44:07.292 --> 00:44:09.292]  And I think, why does no one say that?
[00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:11.292]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:44:11.292 --> 00:44:17.292]  The one thing we know for certain is the United States is going to be one intense place this fall, moving into this presidential election.
[00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:23.292]  So we thought, what better time to hit the road and see the country, and we're going to this fall.
[00:44:23.292 --> 00:44:30.292]  We are pleased, in fact thrilled, to announce Tucker Carlson Live, which is what it sounds like, a nationwide tour.
[00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:32.292]  And at every show, we'll be joined by a friend, a special guest.
[00:44:32.292 --> 00:44:38.292]  Megyn Kelly, Glenn Beck, Tulsi Gabbard, Praveek Ramaswamy, Russell Brand, and many others.
[00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:41.882]  We're going to be live on stage responding to everything that is happening in real time.
[00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:45.665]  It's going to be fun as hell and interesting.
[00:44:45.685 --> 00:44:48.127]  You can get tickets at tuckercarlson.com.
[00:44:48.167 --> 00:44:49.288]  They are certain to sell out.
[00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:51.910]  We encourage you to get one, and we'll see you there.
[00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:59.155]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones, you're on X.
[00:45:00.115 --> 00:45:08.436]   Like we should have at least one person saying that maybe everyone else is on the side of of finance which is to say money lending but maybe we should have one person who's like yeah
[00:45:08.436 --> 00:45:15.876]   I'm not sure it's a good idea to be in debt to someone else because then that person controls you and you're no longer free like duh you know what I mean?
[00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.411]  We are totally out of balance.
[00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:19.112]  Tucker, you're 100% on target.
[00:45:19.132 --> 00:45:23.074]  I mean, when I'm immersed in cities and computers and work, I'm not happy.
[00:45:23.474 --> 00:45:29.137]  And when I'm in nature, I am in heaven, particularly in the desert or the woods somewhere where cell phones don't work.
[00:45:29.237 --> 00:45:31.478]  I just suddenly feel so calm, so good.
[00:45:31.498 --> 00:45:32.018]  It's amazing.
[00:45:32.038 --> 00:45:37.721]  So in the time we have left here, this is an incredible interview, I literally wrote 60 plus questions and I've gotten about 10 of them.
[00:45:39.041 --> 00:45:46.543]  But let's shift gears back into one of the few questions I asked your crew for, because we don't like pre-programming these interviews, but I said, what's something Tucker wants to talk about?
[00:45:47.383 --> 00:45:49.044]  Saving civilization, saving humanity.
[00:45:49.064 --> 00:45:58.907]  We've already kind of talked a lot about that, but specifically, let's speak to how do we stop World War III, and then the election, the lawfare, everything backfiring on the establishment.
[00:45:58.987 --> 00:46:01.167]   My concern is What are they going to pull?
[00:46:01.187 --> 00:46:03.588]  Well, right on time, the bird flu, they're trying to relaunch that.
[00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:07.790]  Right on time, they're saying terrorists are about to attack if they open the borders up.
[00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.792]  Right on time, they're trying to accelerate the war with Russia.
[00:46:12.272 --> 00:46:15.533]  I mean, clearly, they're going to pull some October surprise.
[00:46:16.213 --> 00:46:17.034]  What do you think that is?
[00:46:19.054 --> 00:46:19.995]  I don't know what it is.
[00:46:20.075 --> 00:46:26.157]  I mean, my instinct for two years has been that the war in Ukraine, the U.S.
[00:46:26.277 --> 00:46:34.880]   war against Russia, Will change world history and certainly change American history and will have an effect on this election.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.921]  I really think that's the biggest thing happening right now.
[00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:41.444]  There are a lot of big things happening but that's the only one with the potential to kill us all in the next three months.
[00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:51.031]  So I do think that will play a role in this election because of course wartime gives government wartime powers and those are very different from peacetime powers.
[00:46:51.151 --> 00:47:02.786]   Abraham Lincoln who I think was a good man in a lot of ways but became of course a dictator In the middle of civil war and suspended habeas corpus and detained people without charging them and etc, etc.
[00:47:02.806 --> 00:47:14.517]  So even I think, you know, even decent men tend to become Winston Churchill, put the entire opposition party in prison with their wives for the duration of the Second World War.
[00:47:15.197 --> 00:47:17.419]  I don't think Churchill was the most evil man in history.
[00:47:17.459 --> 00:47:18.720]  I think that's an evil thing to do.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:24.804]  And so even good people can become fascist during wartime, and almost always do.
[00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:27.585]  So that's something to remember, I think.
[00:47:28.626 --> 00:47:37.172]  As to what we can do about it, well, we can do what we're doing, which is to try and tell the truth without fear, as clearly as we can, as thoughtfully as we can, as non-hysterically, as persuasively as we can.
[00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:43.919]  But I think the main thing that we can do is recognize our inability to really do anything, because we're not in charge, actually.
[00:47:44.399 --> 00:47:51.824]  And so what you can do is become a better person, a more virtuous person, and say your freakin' prayers.
[00:47:52.304 --> 00:47:53.084]  I really believe that.
[00:47:53.224 --> 00:47:53.705]  I think that.
[00:47:54.145 --> 00:47:56.647]  Because at a certain point, like, countries get what they want.
[00:47:57.347 --> 00:48:11.329]   And if, you know, all of a sudden you wake up in a country where, you know, a lot of people are convinced it's more virtuous to abort a child than to have a child, People are convinced that, like, war with Russia is somehow really important because Neville Chamberlain bad or whatever.
[00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.451]  You know, it's hard to stop that.
[00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:14.011]  It is.
[00:48:14.071 --> 00:48:15.032]  It's hard to stop that.
[00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:19.855]  And so you really need to appeal to a higher power because your power is limited.
[00:48:20.356 --> 00:48:21.857]  Like, I tell myself this all the time.
[00:48:21.897 --> 00:48:23.058]  Like, something will happen.
[00:48:23.078 --> 00:48:23.878]  I'll get completely outraged.
[00:48:23.938 --> 00:48:24.939]  I got to talk about this!
[00:48:24.999 --> 00:48:27.781]  And then part of me says, you know, but don't don't fool yourself.
[00:48:27.861 --> 00:48:34.947]   Like, talking about things Is not in the end, you know, the same as like commanding an army or being God.
[00:48:35.147 --> 00:48:36.829]  Like you can't, your power is limited.
[00:48:37.469 --> 00:48:40.952]  And so I think it's important to appeal to a higher power.
[00:48:41.072 --> 00:48:48.659]  If this is a spiritual war, and clearly it is, just on, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this, but I've just tried to contain it to like the logical unpacking of it.
[00:48:48.699 --> 00:48:51.181]  I don't see what else it could be other than a spiritual war.
[00:48:51.221 --> 00:48:54.924]  Well, Tucker, I think you're being very, I think you're being very healthy.
[00:48:55.902 --> 00:48:58.204]  Being humble, but you are doing something about it.
[00:48:58.224 --> 00:48:59.065]  That's why they want to stop you.
[00:48:59.085 --> 00:49:03.869]  I think we have to understand that individually, you know, we can reach out to others, but I get your point.
[00:49:04.029 --> 00:49:05.430]  So looking at this...
[00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:07.525]  We saw January 6th.
[00:49:07.565 --> 00:49:10.907]  You've really been the tip of the spear exposing that it was a provocative event.
[00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:11.947]  It's come out in Congress now.
[00:49:12.007 --> 00:49:12.728]  It's all been confirmed.
[00:49:12.848 --> 00:49:18.310]  January 6th, Puppet Committee has destroyed all their evidence because it showed the truth that they were engineering it.
[00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.051]  The new Pelosi video admitting they basically had to stand down.
[00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:22.252]  They wouldn't let the National Guard out.
[00:49:22.672 --> 00:49:25.613]  We walked, I was there, we walked into a trap on that.
[00:49:25.913 --> 00:49:43.651]   We saw Pelosi then With the military parades that she was there inspecting and the barbed wire and all these really fascistic totalitarian things we saw and now they're all over the news as you know saying they're training militias, right-wingers, terrorists, they're going to attack.
[00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:56.320]  They're pre-programming that, and just like with the fake Governor Whitmer kidnapping, I don't believe, I know, because they've done this before and they're telegraphing it, they're planning to try to trigger civil unrest if they build a civil war.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.302]  They've got the movies out, they've got it all pre-programmed.
[00:49:59.322 --> 00:50:00.583]  That's another one of my big concerns.
[00:50:00.603 --> 00:50:01.324]  What's your view on that?
[00:50:02.841 --> 00:50:04.382]  Well, that's so obviously true.
[00:50:04.402 --> 00:50:11.205]  I mean, you know, one of the many binaries, I think, in life is male-female, masculine-feminine.
[00:50:11.225 --> 00:50:14.947]  And there are two ways of fighting and communicating.
[00:50:15.087 --> 00:50:15.808]  And they're very different.
[00:50:15.828 --> 00:50:17.769]  In fact, they're poles.
[00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:18.969]  They're the opposite of one another.
[00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:20.470]  One is direct.
[00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.331]  That's, of course, the masculine form.
[00:50:22.431 --> 00:50:23.772]  And the other is indirect.
[00:50:24.612 --> 00:50:25.533]  And that's the female form.
[00:50:25.693 --> 00:50:27.854]  And the Democratic Party is, of course, a female party.
[00:50:28.714 --> 00:50:30.055]  And that's how they fight.
[00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:36.270]   They fight by You know, they hit you in the face and scream, stop punching me!
[00:50:36.551 --> 00:50:37.392]  Stop punching me!
[00:50:38.695 --> 00:50:40.077]  That's exactly what they do.
[00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:42.121]  A man fights, he says, what'd you do?
[00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:43.564]  I'm going to kick your ass and then does it.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:44.960]  Of course.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:49.103]  And so, January 6th was sort of in keeping with the way they approached the world.
[00:50:49.143 --> 00:50:51.644]  It was a passive-aggressive action.
[00:50:52.345 --> 00:50:58.668]  It was, set this up, make it seem like the other guys are attacking, and then crush them.
[00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:01.690]  And so, of course, they don't change.
[00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:02.711]  That's who they are.
[00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:05.292]  They're feline, not canine.
[00:51:06.073 --> 00:51:09.114]  And they will do something very much like that, of course.
[00:51:09.715 --> 00:51:17.687]   But I don't think that that should deter people from Saying what they think is true and being bold in doing that.
[00:51:18.087 --> 00:51:28.960]  And so, for example, Trump is being sentenced on July 11th, so a week before the Republican convention, and they may remand him, they may send him right to jail.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.201]  How should he respond to that?
[00:51:30.241 --> 00:51:31.342]  I mean, there are two ways to respond.
[00:51:31.623 --> 00:52:01.003]   One, Is by, you know, doing what they say, doing a press conference from jail, they're persecuting me the other way, and I can't recommend the better way, but there is another way, which is to say, no, this is completely illegitimate, I'm not going to jail, this is a fake crime, you never would have indicted me for it if I hadn't been challenging your power, if I wasn't running for president, I wouldn't be sentenced to jail right now, that's just a fact, everyone knows that's true, this whole process is a sham, I don't believe in your system, my ancestors created this system, and you've taken it over somehow,
[00:52:01.423 --> 00:52:03.465]  And perverted it into something unrecognizable.
[00:52:03.705 --> 00:52:04.506]  And I'm not playing along.
[00:52:05.086 --> 00:52:05.707]  I'm not playing along.
[00:52:05.867 --> 00:52:07.749]  I'm not actually going to jail, so why don't you make me?
[00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.351]  And, you know, that is a way to approach it.
[00:52:10.852 --> 00:52:12.473]  And I would say that's the more direct way.
[00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:15.215]  Like, why play along with this stuff?
[00:52:15.255 --> 00:52:16.056]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:52:16.256 --> 00:52:22.462]  But in order to take that posture, you have to be ready to, you know, to get hurt.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:23.640]  You do.
[00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:30.705]  But I would argue that you have to be ready to get hurt whenever you tell the truth, you know, physically or in some other way.
[00:52:31.386 --> 00:52:33.187]  You know, you have to, you know, there's a risk involved.
[00:52:33.207 --> 00:52:36.109]  That's why everyone went and took the vax because, like, they don't want to take the vax.
[00:52:36.189 --> 00:52:38.971]  Many people didn't, but they're like, it's not worth dealing with the consequences.
[00:52:39.252 --> 00:52:39.992]  So let me stop you.
[00:52:40.012 --> 00:52:40.653]  Let me stop you.
[00:52:40.993 --> 00:52:41.914]  This is, this is incredible.
[00:52:42.514 --> 00:52:43.895]  And I've been, you're right.
[00:52:43.915 --> 00:52:44.776]  I've been thinking about this.
[00:52:45.834 --> 00:52:50.977]  I've tried to be Gandhi-esque and have said, you know, never be violent in any way, offensively.
[00:52:51.398 --> 00:53:09.849]  But there comes a point with civil disobedience where these are kangaroo courts, it's all been proven, and this is the other political party that's tried to take him off the ballot and been caught at every level rigging these cases, and it's all blown up their face, where Trump then finally says, no, I'm staying here at Mar-a-Lago, this is a fraud, I'm not going.
[00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:13.732]  The problem is then the deep state stages terror attacks, blames Trump supporters for it.
[00:53:14.572 --> 00:53:16.554]  And so Trump currently saying, I don't mind going to jail.
[00:53:16.574 --> 00:53:18.235]  He's going to put himself in jail in Rikers Island.
[00:53:18.576 --> 00:53:20.277]  My concern is they might poison or kill him.
[00:53:20.317 --> 00:53:21.458]  They're that desperate.
[00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:22.759]  So speak to that.
[00:53:22.859 --> 00:53:28.464]  And then clearly he has secret service because presidents are under threat and political assassination goes on all the time.
[00:53:28.504 --> 00:53:31.506]  They just pumped a month ago, five bullets in the Slovakian.
[00:53:32.267 --> 00:53:42.987]   President FICO and they're trying to kill the other leaders, I mean, this is what happens at the start of a major world war, so it's very paradoxical, so can you quantify, I don't
[00:53:42.987 --> 00:53:51.867]   think you're calling for either in a way, but you're just basically putting on the table what the options are of what's happening.
[00:53:52.504 --> 00:53:54.345]  I mean, I have no idea what the right answer is.
[00:53:54.485 --> 00:53:56.965]  I'm, thank God, not facing a decision like that.
[00:53:57.705 --> 00:53:58.225]  Trump is.
[00:53:58.465 --> 00:54:01.466]  And I think he'll probably, if he's remanded to jail, he'll probably go to jail.
[00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:05.447]  I'm only saying, at a certain point, it's important to acknowledge reality.
[00:54:05.467 --> 00:54:06.487]  And here's the reality.
[00:54:06.807 --> 00:54:07.687]  This is not justice.
[00:54:07.707 --> 00:54:08.887]  This is not a justice system.
[00:54:09.007 --> 00:54:16.309]  This is a husk of a system built by other people hundreds of years ago that has been taken over by new people who perverted its original intent.
[00:54:17.009 --> 00:54:18.190]  It's not real, it's fake.
[00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:19.351]  It's like Harvard University.
[00:54:19.571 --> 00:54:22.573]  Harvard University was the place where the smartest people in the country went.
[00:54:23.134 --> 00:54:32.941]  Now it's a place where you go based on your sex and your race, and the standards have been dropped dramatically, and the rest of us pretend that this zombie institution is the institution that we remember.
[00:54:33.641 --> 00:54:34.142]  And it's not.
[00:54:34.302 --> 00:54:35.343]  And it's just important to say that.
[00:54:35.383 --> 00:54:50.818]  I mean, in Zimbabwe, at the height of Mugabe's reign of terror against whites, he used the British, effectively Anglo justice system in place in Zimbabwe to crush the people whose ancestors built it.
[00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:52.740]  It wasn't a real system.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:55:01.243]  It had bore no resemblance whatsoever to the system that had been in place before Mugabe got there, except, you know, the outward, you know, affectations are all the same.
[00:55:01.283 --> 00:55:02.703]  The judges still wore wigs.
[00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:06.085]  They still, you know, called the court to order with a gavel.
[00:55:06.605 --> 00:55:08.526]  But at its heart, it was a completely different thing.
[00:55:08.546 --> 00:55:11.869]   And You know, you could argue about whether it's a better thing or a worse thing.
[00:55:11.909 --> 00:55:13.110]  I'm just noting the obvious.
[00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:14.412]  But that brings us to lawfare.
[00:55:14.752 --> 00:55:16.514]  And I think it's important to say that.
[00:55:16.815 --> 00:55:17.055]  It is.
[00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:18.376]  That brings us to lawfare.
[00:55:18.917 --> 00:55:19.918]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[00:55:19.938 --> 00:55:20.639]  It's not about me.
[00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:23.242]  I knew I was a beta test where I'm found guilty by two judges.
[00:55:23.863 --> 00:55:28.628]  Then they have show trials produced by HBO with the judges putting on makeup with scripts.
[00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:34.589]   And so I was there in a movie production, and to me it wasn't about, oh, I feel sorry for myself.
[00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:38.109]  I was like, holy crap, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:42.469]   And then now we've seen it with Trump and everybody else and Steve Bannon and Navarro.
[00:55:42.469 --> 00:55:47.589]   I mean, imagine if they're able to steal the election again, what they're going to do,
[00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:52.849]   because they've said on MSNBC, as you know, and everywhere, oh, we're gonna not just go after Trump, all his supporters.
[00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:56.869]   And then Biden put out in 2021, his national security directive,
[00:55:56.869 --> 00:56:00.269]   the main threat's white supremacy, that basically is almost non-existent
[00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:01.649]  when it comes to violence.
[00:56:01.649 --> 00:56:05.629]   And then he went on, as you know, to say, what is the definition of white supremacy?
[00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:11.789]   Questioning an election, questioning lockdowns, questioning open borders, questioning forced inoculations.
[00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:13.189]  So what do you...
[00:56:12.796 --> 00:56:20.616]   imagine they're going to do if they're able to steal it again? What do you see unfolding there and what will they do if they retain power in this
[00:56:20.616 --> 00:56:32.176]   societal coup? Well what won't they do? I mean they're trying to put the front-runner in the presidential race in prison for the rest of his life
[00:56:32.176 --> 00:56:38.748]   for things that are not crimes. So that just I mean that it answers its own Like, they will do anything.
[00:56:38.768 --> 00:56:42.490]  And I would expect that to continue.
[00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:46.753]  I mean, I do think the formality of these elections is really irksome to them.
[00:56:47.153 --> 00:56:54.998]  They hate the whole idea that people they despise would have a role in choosing the government or have any power whatsoever or be disobedient in any way.
[00:56:55.358 --> 00:56:56.499]  So they hate elections.
[00:56:56.619 --> 00:56:59.281]  The defenders of democracy hate above all democracy, of course.
[00:56:59.941 --> 00:57:03.622]  And so I think they will go very, very far in eliminating it.
[00:57:03.862 --> 00:57:04.603]  I do think that.
[00:57:04.983 --> 00:57:11.365]  And that's why I think that this election is potentially the last one, you know, real election.
[00:57:11.425 --> 00:57:12.906]  I think to the extent it's even real.
[00:57:13.386 --> 00:57:17.767]  As to what we can do, I mean, look, I'll just tell you what I've resolved to do, which I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[00:57:17.907 --> 00:57:21.068]  I don't believe in hurting other people except in self-defense, and I really mean that.
[00:57:21.108 --> 00:57:23.309]  That's a religious precept for me, and I'm not going to change.
[00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:24.110]  Period.
[00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:28.031]  So I'm not staging any kind of violent revolution against anybody, and I'm not going to.
[00:57:28.471 --> 00:57:31.653]  And I wouldn't recommend anyone else do it either, but that's what I've decided.
[00:57:32.093 --> 00:57:33.794]  But I'm going to tell the truth no matter what.
[00:57:34.394 --> 00:57:34.795]  Period.
[00:57:34.815 --> 00:57:41.098]  I'm going to say it as loudly as I possibly can, recognizing the whole time that the consequences could be very severe.
[00:57:41.118 --> 00:57:43.419]  I mean, I know for a fact they could be.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.960]  I've already dealt with this a little bit.
[00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:49.344]  And I mean, actual consequences, but that's just what it is.
[00:57:49.364 --> 00:57:51.846]  Like, what did you expect life was going to be about?
[00:57:52.106 --> 00:57:53.527]  Just ordering shit from Amazon?
[00:57:53.567 --> 00:57:55.869]  Like, this is what it is, actually.
[00:57:55.909 --> 00:57:57.310]  This is what it's always been.
[00:57:57.911 --> 00:58:12.258]   And we just grew up, I'll speak for myself, I grew up in a world so insulated from reality, In 1985, America was just so rich, effectively unchallenged internationally, so stable domestically, that you never really had to face human nature.
[00:58:12.318 --> 00:58:17.759]  Well, now we do have to face human nature, and human nature is, you know, both good and bad, and there's certainly ugly parts of it.
[00:58:17.919 --> 00:58:22.340]  I mean, as, you know, as in Jeremiah, it says, who knows the depravity of the human heart?
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:27.042]  Like, it's like, they're capable, people are capable of anything, at their worst.
[00:58:27.742 --> 00:58:28.663]  And so just know that.
[00:58:28.843 --> 00:58:29.303]  It's alright.
[00:58:29.363 --> 00:58:30.024]  Just know that.
[00:58:30.264 --> 00:58:32.086]  And stop being so shocked by it.
[00:58:32.186 --> 00:58:34.648]  Like, would they kill people to take control of the world?
[00:58:34.708 --> 00:58:35.328]  Are you joking?
[00:58:35.669 --> 00:58:35.909]  Yeah.
[00:58:36.089 --> 00:58:36.549]  Who wouldn't?
[00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.490]  Absolutely.
[00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.372]  People have always killed people to take control of the world.
[00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:39.612]  Right.
[00:58:39.652 --> 00:58:41.614]  So like, you really do need to get out.
[00:58:41.714 --> 00:58:44.316]  I think it's easier for young people to get this because they didn't grow up.
[00:58:44.836 --> 00:58:48.677]  in this country with the expectation that, you know, everything will always be great.
[00:58:48.677 --> 00:58:51.076]  I mean, that's the country that I grew up in, I think you did as well.
[00:58:51.076 --> 00:58:51.876]  Normalcy bias.
[00:58:51.876 --> 00:58:53.076]  You couldn't even imagine.
[00:58:53.076 --> 00:58:54.277]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:54.277 --> 00:58:55.876]  That's a nice way to put it.
[00:58:55.876 --> 00:58:57.476]  So just, like, know that.
[00:58:57.476 --> 00:59:06.516]   And if you're going to participate in it, speaking for myself in a nonviolent way, know that telling the truth and you're a living example of this is enough to get you killed.
[00:59:06.711 --> 00:59:10.432]  Telling the truth is that offensive to the people in charge because they're not just liars.
[00:59:10.932 --> 00:59:12.012]  Their currency is lies.
[00:59:12.252 --> 00:59:13.013]  They're about lies.
[00:59:13.053 --> 00:59:14.153]  The whole thing is a lie.
[00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:17.034]  And truth is the most offensive thing to them.
[00:59:17.194 --> 00:59:18.075]  So yeah, could you get killed?
[00:59:18.115 --> 00:59:18.995]  Absolutely you could get killed.
[00:59:19.495 --> 00:59:21.616]  But maybe stop whining about it and do the right thing.
[00:59:21.636 --> 00:59:22.956]  I was about to say the alternative.
[00:59:23.016 --> 00:59:28.538]  I would much rather be... I would much rather be killed telling the truth than I would, like, die of ALS or something.
[00:59:28.578 --> 00:59:29.958]  Like, we're all gonna die in the end.
[00:59:30.019 --> 00:59:31.159]  I don't... I don't want to.
[00:59:31.259 --> 00:59:32.759]  I don't... I'm not on a suicide trip.
[00:59:32.799 --> 00:59:33.480]  I love my life.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:36.701]  And I love my children and my wife and my friends and my dogs and the whole thing.
[00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:40.342]  But, you are gonna die, so you might as well be brave.
[00:59:40.622 --> 00:59:41.622]  That's how I feel about it.
[00:59:41.622 --> 00:59:49.462]   And when you have that attitude, you have a vibrant, powerful civilization, but when you're always cowering to whoever's bullying you, then the worst bullies ascend to power.
[00:59:49.462 --> 00:59:58.622]   There was a famous interview with the newspaper, Thomas Jefferson, it's where the quote comes from of all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish as good men do nothing, the newspaper
[00:59:58.622 --> 01:00:01.302]  interviewer said, "Well, what's the level that tyrants will go?"
[01:00:01.324 --> 01:00:04.765]  And he said, whatever level you accept, because there's always one worse that will replace them.
[01:00:05.225 --> 01:00:07.285]  Tucker, we've been going for an hour.
[01:00:07.365 --> 01:00:09.086]  You've agreed to do about 25, 30 more minutes.
[01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:13.146]  Do you want to take a quick little break here and come back or just keep going?
[01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:14.687]  No, I'm totally good.
[01:00:15.087 --> 01:00:20.568]  I would just say, you know, part of it is like, I don't think I'll ever figure out in my lifetime until I'm dead.
[01:00:21.437 --> 01:00:30.641]  Um, what went on, you know, over the past 10 years, it's too confusing, you know, and I don't think any person can fully understand the moment he's living in.
[01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:36.564]  But it does seem pretty clear to me that generational affluence has made America a lot weaker.
[01:00:36.724 --> 01:00:37.584]  I'm not for poverty.
[01:00:38.104 --> 01:00:41.326]  I'm not, you know, saying it's a good thing to not have enough to eat.
[01:00:41.366 --> 01:00:41.646]  I'm not.
[01:00:41.826 --> 01:00:43.847]  But meritocracy has been murdered.
[01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:51.756]  Well, meritocracy is long gone, but generational affluence is bad for families and it's bad for countries.
[01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:57.839]  And I think one of the things we're seeing now is that people just feel like, just make the pain stop.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.601]  I don't, I'm super, super comfortable.
[01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:02.042]  I don't want to be uncomfortable.
[01:01:02.182 --> 01:01:02.722]  And I get that.
[01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:03.683]  I feel the same way, by the way.
[01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:04.643]  I'm not judging anyone.
[01:01:05.023 --> 01:01:05.944]  I just want to be comfortable.
[01:01:06.004 --> 01:01:06.304]  I get it.
[01:01:06.966 --> 01:01:09.167]  But that's not sort of an option right now, actually.
[01:01:10.308 --> 01:01:12.629]  Being comfortable is not, you know, on the menu.
[01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:14.210]  You're going to be uncomfortable.
[01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.950]  Stagnant.
[01:01:16.191 --> 01:01:20.573]  Yeah, and it's better to choose dignity, I think.
[01:01:20.753 --> 01:01:22.074]  It's better to be dignified about it.
[01:01:22.094 --> 01:01:22.794]  And what does that mean?
[01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:25.676]  Specifically, it means saying what you think is true, because you're not a slave.
[01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:26.636]  You're a human being.
[01:01:26.676 --> 01:01:28.717]  You're made by God, not the Biden administration.
[01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.900]  You have an inherent right to say what you think, to believe what you want.
[01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:38.414]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me @realalexjones here on X.
[01:01:39.414 --> 01:01:40.734]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:47.734]   The one thing we know for certain is the United States is going to be one intense place this fall, moving into this presidential election.
[01:01:47.734 --> 01:01:51.574]  So we thought, what better time to hit the road and see the country?
[01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:53.174]  And we're going to this fall.
[01:01:53.174 --> 01:02:01.334]   We are pleased, in fact, thrilled to announce Tucker Carlson live, which is what it sounds like, a nationwide tour that at every show will be joined by a
[01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:02.334]  friend, a special guest.
[01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:08.369]  Megyn Kelly, Glenn Beck, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, Russell Brand, and many others.
[01:02:08.409 --> 01:02:12.171]  We're going to be live on stage responding to everything that is happening in real time.
[01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:16.113]  It's going to be fun as hell and interesting.
[01:02:16.294 --> 01:02:18.415]  You can get tickets at TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:19.555]  They are certain to sell out.
[01:02:19.816 --> 01:02:23.056]  We encourage you to get one, and we'll see you there.
[01:02:23.056 --> 01:02:29.856]  [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:02:29.856 --> 01:02:31.116]  What did he just say?
[01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:41.116]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.790]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:40.750]  I know.
[01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:44.415]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:47.336]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[01:02:48.036 --> 01:02:51.155]  at real Alex Jones on X.
[01:02:51.155 --> 01:03:10.996]   And the second someone tries to take that away from you, you know, you have a, you have a moral obligation to resist that.
[01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:12.634]  You have to, you don't have a choice.
[01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:19.600]  I mean, by the way, most days I would rather just sit in bed and eat French toast and read PG Woodhouse novels with my dogs, okay?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.142]  That's kind of my preferred, you know what I mean, day?
[01:03:22.162 --> 01:03:22.762]  Sounds good, no, believe me.
[01:03:22.782 --> 01:03:24.724]  Because I'm lazy and self-indulgent.
[01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:25.244]  No, I am.
[01:03:26.005 --> 01:03:28.627]  But, that's just not a choice, we don't have that choice.
[01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:30.929]  So, be a man about it.
[01:03:32.216 --> 01:03:33.176]  Don't lie to yourself.
[01:03:34.097 --> 01:03:39.238]  Am I going to go along with the deception and become something less than human?
[01:03:39.878 --> 01:03:45.340]  Or am I going to say in a gentle, non-violent, but persistent way, no, I'm not doing that.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.060]  I'm not taking your COVID vax.
[01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:49.361]  I'm not going to pretend boys can become girls.
[01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:55.883]  I'm not going to, you know, mouth the slogans about Vladimir Putin and Zelensky that you're telling me to mouth.
[01:03:56.023 --> 01:03:57.164]  I'm just not going to do that.
[01:03:57.404 --> 01:03:59.744]  And there's nothing you can do to me that will make me do that.
[01:03:59.904 --> 01:04:00.865]  That's beautiful, Tucker.
[01:04:00.885 --> 01:04:01.925]  Including death, and I mean it.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.582]  So, I've got a bunch of questions now I want to race through here with you.
[01:04:07.002 --> 01:04:13.526]  So since you talk about it, knowing Trump, and I've been the same, I've been mad at Trump, I've supported Trump.
[01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:15.528]  We're not zombies, we're not slaves.
[01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:17.149]  Sometimes I hate him, sometimes I love him.
[01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:18.089]  I've been public about that.
[01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:19.430]  They're like, why did Tucker say bad things?
[01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:19.950]  He says good things.
[01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:20.951]  Well, it's a complex issue.
[01:04:21.331 --> 01:04:22.892]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[01:04:22.952 --> 01:04:23.953]  Let's be completely honest.
[01:04:24.413 --> 01:04:27.295]  I know you're a nice guy, but I want your real critique of Trump.
[01:04:28.075 --> 01:04:30.457]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[01:04:30.557 --> 01:04:32.038]  And also, who is Donald Trump?
[01:04:36.004 --> 01:04:40.350]  Well, Trump is a really unusual person, an extraordinary person.
[01:04:40.811 --> 01:04:41.532]  You know, not all good.
[01:04:41.773 --> 01:04:43.996]  Obviously, nobody is, but he's unusual.
[01:04:44.036 --> 01:04:44.857]  There aren't many people.
[01:04:44.897 --> 01:04:45.759]  I know a lot of people.
[01:04:45.859 --> 01:04:47.741]  My job is knowing people, talking to people.
[01:04:47.782 --> 01:04:49.544]  I haven't met anybody like Trump ever.
[01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.109]  Um, who is he really?
[01:04:52.129 --> 01:04:54.252]  I mean, you know, we'll know that when we die.
[01:04:54.532 --> 01:04:56.755]  You know, it's hard to know who people really are.
[01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:59.177]  And I should just say, I've been mad at Trump.
[01:04:59.237 --> 01:04:59.798]  I've said so.
[01:05:00.819 --> 01:05:03.823]  But my gut level affection for Trump is really strong.
[01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:04.624]  I just like Trump.
[01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:05.705]  I like talking to Trump.
[01:05:05.765 --> 01:05:07.046]  I like having dinner with Trump.
[01:05:07.106 --> 01:05:08.188]  He's just an appealing guy.
[01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:08.889]  So I should say that.
[01:05:09.509 --> 01:05:10.369]  But who is he really?
[01:05:10.409 --> 01:05:12.410]  I mean, these are deep waters.
[01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.430]  Who am I really?
[01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:15.771]  God will judge that.
[01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:20.452]  But I would say they hate Trump for reasons that are not obvious.
[01:05:20.572 --> 01:05:26.093]  So if what they wanted was a certain policy outcome, Trump is not very ideological.
[01:05:26.153 --> 01:05:39.078]   So if the most important thing to Permanent Washington was continuing to fund Zelensky, and that is very important to them, then they would just say, look, We're going to shut off all campaign donations and send you to prison until you agree to fund Ukraine forever.
[01:05:39.158 --> 01:05:40.719]  And Trump will probably say, OK, it's worth it.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.860]  That's not what this is about.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.722]  I mean, they want that, but that's not what it's about.
[01:05:45.782 --> 01:05:55.728]  They understand, and by they I mean the bipartisan coalition that runs Washington and has for decades and has really run America into the ground and mismanaged the world to the point we're on the cusp of nuclear war.
[01:05:55.748 --> 01:05:56.569]  OK, those people.
[01:05:57.432 --> 01:05:59.793]  Those people understand, they've kind of come to the end.
[01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:00.933]  They've come to the end.
[01:06:00.953 --> 01:06:02.634]  They have no inherent credibility.
[01:06:03.014 --> 01:06:04.475]  They're not democratically elected.
[01:06:05.155 --> 01:06:07.736]  I think the last election was a sham, even if it was real.
[01:06:08.076 --> 01:06:14.258]  The majority of the population does not support their program, so they don't have a democratic mandate, which is to say a legitimate mandate.
[01:06:14.598 --> 01:06:16.779]  In a democracy, legitimacy derives from the population.
[01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:19.100]  If most people don't support something, then it's not legitimate, right?
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.100]  Because it's a democracy.
[01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:20.981]  That simple.
[01:06:21.621 --> 01:06:23.863]  They don't have that, so they know they're illegitimate.
[01:06:24.263 --> 01:06:28.466]  They know that if they lose, they're going to face consequences to some extent.
[01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:31.228]  Probably not great consequences, let's be honest, but some consequences.
[01:06:31.808 --> 01:06:47.819]   But more to the point, when you are fragile, when you realize that people don't really support you, when you know that you're illegitimate, when you know you've committed criminal acts, and they have, a lot of them, Then any chink in the armor is potentially fatal, because you are weak.
[01:06:48.299 --> 01:06:49.040]  That's the truth.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.261]  They are weak.
[01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:55.084]  Their empire is built on lies, purely on deception, and you can feel it when you deal with them.
[01:06:55.665 --> 01:06:57.046]  Weak people are fragile.
[01:06:57.486 --> 01:07:00.428]  It's the divorced mom with a hangover like, SHUT UP!
[01:07:00.728 --> 01:07:01.329]  SHUT UP!
[01:07:02.049 --> 01:07:02.550]  STOP!
[01:07:03.636 --> 01:07:07.200]  Whereas, you know, the strong sober dad is like, settle down a little bit.
[01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:08.001]  You know, it's okay.
[01:07:08.382 --> 01:07:08.562]  Right?
[01:07:08.722 --> 01:07:10.685]  Strong people are not hysterical.
[01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.206]  Weak people are hysterical.
[01:07:12.246 --> 01:07:14.669]  So their gut level understanding and they're absolutely right.
[01:07:15.566 --> 01:07:18.228]  If they let... So if I were running this, I'd say, just let the guy win.
[01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:19.350]  Why do you care?
[01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:20.250]  It's four years.
[01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:21.531]  It's a lot easier.
[01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:22.733]  You don't have to have all these fights.
[01:07:23.253 --> 01:07:25.055]  You don't have to go crazy or wreck the system.
[01:07:25.095 --> 01:07:27.377]  Let the guy win and then, you know, win again in four years.
[01:07:27.437 --> 01:07:30.980]  Or like, how about make a little bigger effort with working class whites?
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.101]  Like, why is that so hard?
[01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:35.864]  And isn't that Trump's biggest success, Tucker, is that he's drawn out the deep state?
[01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:46.335]  Well that is his success, but they can't allow him... I've only reached this conclusion recently because it's not obvious as a political analysis.
[01:07:46.716 --> 01:07:49.299]  There are other ways to get what you want than what they're doing.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.744]  But Trump as a symbol is deadly to them.
[01:07:54.145 --> 01:08:06.815]   If Trump is elected again, Their whole system, like they fear that their whole system and not just the government but you know the spider web of NGOs and publicly traded businesses.
[01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.116]  It emboldens the people.
[01:08:08.276 --> 01:08:08.956]  I mean that's it.
[01:08:08.996 --> 01:08:10.157]  He's not out to get the people.
[01:08:10.197 --> 01:08:11.017]  He knows he makes mistakes.
[01:08:11.398 --> 01:08:12.859]  He's pro-human, pro-populist.
[01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:16.321]  He went to Kim Jong-un and said let's just build hotels and casinos.
[01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.002]  What's your problem?
[01:08:17.522 --> 01:08:19.303]  He just, he wants success and they don't.
[01:08:19.323 --> 01:08:21.244]  They're feudalist, feudal controllers.
[01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:21.805]  They don't want that.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:30.525]  Well, I just think as a symbol, that you're absolutely right, but as a symbol, if he becomes president, what does it suggest?
[01:08:30.685 --> 01:08:37.430]  It suggests that their whole sort of empire of bullshit is collapsing.
[01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:45.676]  And they've said that in the Financial Times and Atlantic Monthly, which is their mouthpiece, they said, if the populists get Trump in again, it's over because it emboldens the populists.
[01:08:47.188 --> 01:08:48.008]  I think that's right.
[01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:58.154]  I mean, just imagine running what you describe as a constitutional republic or a democracy and waking up one morning and finding that your greatest fear is that the majority will get what it wants.
[01:08:59.915 --> 01:09:09.620]  You would think some self-awareness alarm would go off and be like, wait a second, isn't the whole point of this project to deliver to the majority what it wants because they own the government, not me?
[01:09:10.532 --> 01:09:11.852]  But it never seems to occur to them.
[01:09:11.872 --> 01:09:12.352]  Maybe it doesn't.
[01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:14.313]  I don't know what they actually think.
[01:09:14.833 --> 01:09:24.995]  All I know is that they've decided that, and I think it's absurd, I think permanent Washington could easily outlive another four years of Trump, just as it did the first four years of Trump.
[01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:26.696]  But they don't feel that way at all.
[01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:28.976]  And so they will do anything.
[01:09:29.376 --> 01:09:32.477]  And I've talked to Trump about this a number of times.
[01:09:32.937 --> 01:09:34.657]  He's not engaged with me on it.
[01:09:34.897 --> 01:09:35.678]  He's not stupid.
[01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:40.501]   Of course, he understands But he won't respond on the assassination question, so you speak to it.
[01:09:40.521 --> 01:09:41.041]  He will not.
[01:09:41.162 --> 01:09:42.263]  That's clearly the next move.
[01:09:42.323 --> 01:09:42.563]  Right.
[01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:44.685]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:49.909]  And by the way, I think it's a little bit too obvious to, you know, shoot people in a motorcade.
[01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:50.530]  They'll poison him.
[01:09:51.571 --> 01:09:52.972]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:09:52.992 --> 01:09:53.393]  61 years later.
[01:09:53.413 --> 01:09:53.893]  Yeah.
[01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:55.855]  People, there are a lot of ways.
[01:09:56.255 --> 01:10:03.580]   I mean, You know, you do sort of wonder how Jack Ruby died of galloping cancer, like, a week before his second trial.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.381]  Like, what was that?
[01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.202]  You know, they have weaponized cancer that'll kill you in two weeks.
[01:10:07.982 --> 01:10:13.784]  But a CIA psychiatrist, you know, Jolly West visits him and then next thing you know, oh, I've got terminal cancer!
[01:10:14.024 --> 01:10:14.885]  Oh, I'm dead in a week!
[01:10:15.205 --> 01:10:15.405]  Okay.
[01:10:16.205 --> 01:10:17.526]  Um, so, you know, look, I don't know.
[01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:18.467]  I'm not a physician.
[01:10:18.627 --> 01:10:19.928]  I'm not a master of the dark arts.
[01:10:20.688 --> 01:10:38.820]  Um, but I don't, I don't think like shooting people in public is, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit obvious at this point, but there are, there are lots of ways that like, honestly, if you think this is a spiritual war and you're not saying prayers every day, then you don't really think it's a spiritual war.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.100]  Do you?
[01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:40.178]  Right.
[01:10:40.359 --> 01:10:43.622]  And I obviously, so I really do think it's a spiritual war.
[01:10:43.862 --> 01:10:44.683]  I really do believe that.
[01:10:44.984 --> 01:10:50.210]  And these are physical manifestations of an age old conflict.
[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:54.314]  I mean, literally age old, since the beginning of time, this conflict has been playing out.
[01:10:55.175 --> 01:11:01.222]  And we have the privilege of, of knowing that, like, this is kind of the last conclusion I ever thought I would come to in my life.
[01:11:01.912 --> 01:11:13.138]  Growing up in a materialist, rational world in Southern California in the 70s and 80s, if you told me that by 55 I'd be like sitting talking to Alex Jones about how we're in a spiritual war, I'd be like, what?
[01:11:13.218 --> 01:11:13.578]  No!
[01:11:13.598 --> 01:11:14.679]  I don't think so!
[01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:17.520]  But it's just so obvious.
[01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:23.483]  And so I do think prayer plays a huge, huge role in this, like a pivotal role in it.
[01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.625]  And I hope people take that seriously.
[01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:28.706]  Well, we do take it seriously.
[01:11:28.746 --> 01:11:30.167]  So we're at a major crossroads.
[01:11:30.207 --> 01:11:42.771]   To me, The dark forces spiritually manipulating and controlling these minions, these failures, these fallen clown show vassals who really are just spiritual puppets, they're scared of something coming.
[01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:52.575]  And if you study the Bible and other ancient religions, they talk about not the fake liberal New Age stuff, but humans going next level.
[01:11:52.655 --> 01:11:59.838]   And I'm seeing a splitting away, people that get more into darkness, more dumbed down, or people Really becoming more attuned, more connected, more aware.
[01:11:59.878 --> 01:12:04.821]  It's not just you and I, or Joe Rogan waking up, or Jimmy Dore, or Russell Brand, or everybody.
[01:12:05.441 --> 01:12:10.724]  And notice how all the popular people, despite censorship and attack, are people that are pro-human.
[01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:12.105]  Because humans actually want that.
[01:12:12.145 --> 01:12:14.646]  It's like we're selling snow cones in hell.
[01:12:15.546 --> 01:12:19.068]  But at the same time, the system is rushing into control.
[01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:25.151]  I really feel they're scared of humanity reaching a zenith or a tipping point.
[01:12:25.191 --> 01:12:25.932]  What's your view on that?
[01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:32.302]  Well, I mean, I think this is an attempt to extinguish humanity.
[01:12:33.023 --> 01:12:45.321]   You know, if you're a Christian, and I can't speak for other religions, so I think this is kind of a commonly held belief among all world religions, or most anyway, but certainly if you're a Christian, you believe that Mankind, people, were created in God's image.
[01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:48.082]  We're not gods, but God created us in His image.
[01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:54.406]  So if your program is to oppose God, then by definition you're going to want to kill all the people.
[01:12:55.707 --> 01:13:04.692]  So it makes sense theologically, it makes sense intuitively, and I sincerely believe that that is exactly what's happening.
[01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:06.073]  So how do you respond to it?
[01:13:06.153 --> 01:13:11.656]   Well, with bravery, without fear, Like, again, I don't know what everyone's so afraid of.
[01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:12.836]  It's so weird.
[01:13:12.896 --> 01:13:15.157]  Everyone's so- I mean, I'm not- I'm trying not to be judgy.
[01:13:15.197 --> 01:13:17.217]  I mean, there are things worth being afraid of, I guess.
[01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:21.818]  But telling the truth and standing firm in what you know to be true?
[01:13:21.838 --> 01:13:24.639]  I- There's no reason to fear that.
[01:13:24.679 --> 01:13:30.901]  Like, what's the worst thing- Like, if we're living in a totalitarian moment where the aim is to kill people, okay?
[01:13:31.761 --> 01:13:35.202]  You already know how it's gonna end if you don't do anything.
[01:13:36.122 --> 01:13:38.383]  So why not just smile and tell the truth?
[01:13:42.091 --> 01:14:08.913]  Let's go ahead and go to Bikini Truther in Nevada.
[01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:09.453]  Thanks for calling.
[01:14:09.494 --> 01:14:09.794]  Go ahead.
[01:14:11.092 --> 01:14:15.453]  Hey Alex, I do want to say one thing about Dr. Jones Naturals if I could.
[01:14:15.473 --> 01:14:18.753]  I know it's off topic, but it's super important to me.
[01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:19.314]  Sure.
[01:14:19.574 --> 01:14:23.654]  During COVID, I went there and I got the facial serum.
[01:14:24.135 --> 01:14:30.336]  It's called Super Sober Facial Serum, and I'm telling you that it's changed my life.
[01:14:30.816 --> 01:14:36.717]  My son started taking it, his acne went away, and it's really good for underneath the face cream.
[01:14:37.421 --> 01:14:37.681]  Absolutely.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.041]   that I put on every day, and so I just want, I know that you need support, and that's one item
[01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:48.640]   that, so that we can stay out of World War III to keep you on air, is for people to go there

[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.280]   Absolutely, this is a patented nano-silver, way beyond coal silver.
[01:14:54.415 --> 01:15:00.016]  It's in the creams, in the face spray, in the toothpaste, in the wound gel, and in the immune gargle.
[01:15:00.156 --> 01:15:01.696]  And it's just, it's amazing.
[01:15:02.136 --> 01:15:03.016]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:15:03.136 --> 01:15:06.557]  People that have acne have had incredible results with this.
[01:15:06.577 --> 01:15:08.278]  So I'm very thankful that you liked it.

[01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:39.285]  I mean, like, what's the worst that can happen?
[01:15:39.305 --> 01:15:40.446]  Well, what's going to happen anyway?
[01:15:40.466 --> 01:15:42.106]  But at least you retain your dignity.
[01:15:42.546 --> 01:15:43.106]  You know what I mean?
[01:15:43.246 --> 01:15:44.646]  I just don't get it.
[01:15:44.686 --> 01:15:45.547]  Why is it so hard?
[01:15:45.947 --> 01:15:46.747]  I totally agree with you.
[01:15:47.147 --> 01:15:56.489]  For me, the great part about being on Earth 30 years, you 30 plus years, is the learning process of trying to tell the truth, trying to learn the truth, getting more and more accurate, still make mistakes.
[01:15:56.949 --> 01:16:05.591]  But for me, when I meet black, white, Hispanic, old, young, Asian, it doesn't matter, people that love liberty, that love freedom, they have electric eyes.
[01:16:06.511 --> 01:16:10.417]  And the children of those people have electric eyes like they did 20, 30 years ago.
[01:16:10.457 --> 01:16:11.138]  Everybody had those.
[01:16:11.158 --> 01:16:14.382]  There's like a soullessness in people now that aren't awake, that are disconnected.
[01:16:14.763 --> 01:16:17.306]  So to me, the journey is the destination.
[01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:23.032]   And to me, it's getting to meet all the really awake people This is amazing!
[01:16:23.052 --> 01:16:28.394]  And then I get around Globalist, not as much as you've been around over the years, but I've been to some of the events and I've had private meetings with them when they want to meet.
[01:16:28.414 --> 01:16:33.695]  I met with some of the Bilderberg Group members and Kissinger tried to get me 15 years ago to work for him, did it in front of my producer.
[01:16:34.595 --> 01:16:35.676]  But I'm around them.
[01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:45.699]  They feel so unhappy and I feel an emptiness, but I'm around you and your wife and your dogs and your crew are around all, just old men, people fishing at a pier.
[01:16:46.479 --> 01:16:47.679]  It is so real.
[01:16:47.739 --> 01:16:48.919]  It's so satisfying.
[01:16:48.959 --> 01:16:49.980]  I want to just defend it.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.820]  I mean, you know what I'm saying?
[01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:52.550]  I know.
[01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:56.013]  I'm embarrassed that I didn't say it before you did.
[01:16:57.795 --> 01:17:01.298]  There's so much sadness in this moment, watching all these things you love be destroyed.
[01:17:02.359 --> 01:17:03.600]  I'm almost over that, actually.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.321]  I've accepted it.
[01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:09.985]  But what I didn't mention, and shame on me for not, is the upside of the moment, which is the people.
[01:17:10.766 --> 01:17:13.487]  I mean, you wind up meeting these people in so many cases.
[01:17:13.527 --> 01:17:20.529]  I had dinner last night or two nights ago in my barn with somebody, a well-known person, who I never in a million years thought I would ever have a meal with.
[01:17:20.849 --> 01:17:22.710]  And it turns out we had everything in common.
[01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:29.312]  And this is one of the people you described, an awake person, who was not where he expected to be, reached conclusions he never thought he would reach.
[01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:35.834]  He's got opinions that were repugnant to him 10 years ago, as do I. And how beautiful is that?
[01:17:35.894 --> 01:17:42.142]   Because People like that are liberated from the burden of having to pretend they don't.
[01:17:42.362 --> 01:17:43.564]  It's a huge burden to lie.
[01:17:43.804 --> 01:17:44.305]  It's a massive.
[01:17:44.325 --> 01:17:50.735]  I mean, all of us lie, you know, and if you caught me doing something terrible today, I probably would lie, you know, but it would be a huge burden.
[01:17:51.747 --> 01:17:55.231]  And once you feel like, well, I don't have to do that anymore, like there's no reason to do that.
[01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:55.912]  Why would I do that?
[01:17:56.492 --> 01:17:57.313]  And I'm just not going to.
[01:17:57.734 --> 01:17:59.155]  Oh, you're just you're just freer.
[01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:00.917]  Like that is actual liberation.
[01:18:01.438 --> 01:18:03.400]  And that's why occasionally you meet people.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:11.829]  I have met people in my life who've been in prison, for example, like actual prison locked away who are so free inside.
[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:12.831]  I'm very anti-prison.
[01:18:13.592 --> 01:18:15.435]  For the record, I'm not encouraging prison.
[01:18:15.475 --> 01:18:16.316]  I hate prison, actually.
[01:18:16.978 --> 01:18:31.088]   But it is also true, and because I've seen known these people, that it's possible to lock a man in a concrete room with no windows and He can be free anyway inside because it is an internal thing, actually.
[01:18:31.148 --> 01:18:37.534]  And when you meet someone who has reached that or is in the process of reaching it, it's just thrilling.
[01:18:37.634 --> 01:18:39.135]  You just want to be around people like that.
[01:18:39.195 --> 01:18:45.700]  So the bottom line is my friendships are so much deeper now than they were 10 years ago.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.781]  It's like no comparison.
[01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:59.435]   Like I have conversations every single day with people that are so deep And rewarding for me, that make me feel so good, so connected to another person, which is the whole purpose of life, break the veil, connect.
[01:18:59.455 --> 01:19:02.176]  I mean, that's what sex is, you know, connect with someone.
[01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:07.417]  But to do that just in conversation with people is thrilling.
[01:19:07.457 --> 01:19:11.459]  And it happens many times more often now than it did 10 years ago.
[01:19:11.579 --> 01:19:13.779]  10 years ago, once a month, I'd be like, wow, I met this amazing person.
[01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:16.800]  I was about to say, I swear to God, we're simpatico.
[01:19:17.121 --> 01:19:19.141]  I was gonna say 10 years ago, it happened like once a month.
[01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.002]  Now it's all day long.
[01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:22.294]  Yes!
[01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:23.595]  I have the same thing!
[01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:24.955]  Like, what is that?
[01:19:25.115 --> 01:19:27.677]  I don't know, but... By the way, I don't need to know.
[01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:29.317]  I mean, I have lots of theories about it.
[01:19:29.337 --> 01:19:32.339]  The, you know, the gathering of, you know, the sorting of society.
[01:19:32.359 --> 01:19:33.479]  I mean, clearly that is happening.
[01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:35.260]  But I don't even need to know.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.240]  I'm just enjoying it.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.121]  It's almost like...
[01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:43.256]  You know, it's almost like I get into bed at night and I've got two dogs under my arms and it's like, I don't think a lot about what that means.
[01:19:43.296 --> 01:19:44.997]  I'm just like, I'm so happy!
[01:19:46.559 --> 01:19:53.645]  It's like, it's just a, it's a, it's a gut level animal joy that I experience when I really connect with someone in a real way.
[01:19:53.685 --> 01:19:57.269]  I think that is one of the main reasons that we're on this earth to do that.
[01:19:57.489 --> 01:20:02.612]  Well dogs are so honest, and I said this to my parents like 30 years ago, I said dogs are like a psychic buffer.
[01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:08.696]  They're even more psychic than us, but they don't even have a mission except to love you and be part of the group, and it's unconditional love.
[01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:11.357]  I mean you feel the love of a dog that loves you.
[01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:14.699]  People that have really mean dogs, I go to their house and say, why does my dog suddenly love you?
[01:20:14.719 --> 01:20:16.960]  I say, well I like him, I like her.
[01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:26.352]   So in the few minutes, 10 minutes we have left Tucker, I think it's clear that we're at a major crossroads and inflection point, the biggest in human civilization that we know of.
[01:20:26.452 --> 01:20:27.274]  Maybe stuff happened before.
[01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:28.856]  We know our mainline history isn't true.
[01:20:28.876 --> 01:20:31.259]  And you talk about that.
[01:20:31.279 --> 01:20:36.287]  So speak about where you think we are in history, and then you've talked about the Nephilim that are in the Bible.
[01:20:37.481 --> 01:20:43.827]  And you're just, and I know the globalists, I know some of the elites, they're obsessed, you know, that's what the movie Prometheus is, it's what they really believe.
[01:20:43.867 --> 01:20:45.368]  None of them are really atheists at the top.
[01:20:45.869 --> 01:20:54.737]  They believe that aliens put us here, that they're about to learn the secrets and become gods, but first they've got to do the sacrifice and survival of the fittest, but you get criticized for that.
[01:20:54.757 --> 01:21:02.062]   We have all these UAVs that are doing, you know, Mach 100 and, you know, turning on perfect lines that, you know, And none of our machines can do.
[01:21:02.062 --> 01:21:03.382]  There's a lot going on here.
[01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:12.622]   So just the infinite, to me, admitting there's an infinite makes these globalists even smaller when they try to have their big events and all their big fanfare and the trumpets playing.
[01:21:12.622 --> 01:21:15.662]  They want us to believe they're everything, they're really nothing.
[01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:25.262]   So I've said a lot there, but we're at a crossroads and you talk about what's in the Bible and the Sumerian text and all these other ancient texts around the world say the exact same
[01:21:25.262 --> 01:21:28.702]  thing and I don't think they want us understanding that.
[01:21:28.702 --> 01:21:37.382]   But it's like they've gotten some order by some other group, like the Bible says the devil's marooned here, wants to kill us, kill, steal, and destroy until we actually carry
[01:21:37.382 --> 01:21:46.035]   out the real mission and what we're about to do like a, like a caterpillar in a cocoon About to come out and be a butterfly.
[01:21:48.817 --> 01:21:49.797]  Well, I hope that's right.
[01:21:50.018 --> 01:21:56.142]  I mean, it does feel like we're moving toward, you know, toward some resolution of a long-standing problem.
[01:21:56.642 --> 01:21:58.043]  But, you know, that may not be the case.
[01:21:58.103 --> 01:22:09.330]  You can't... Let me just say, parenthetically, I adamantly agree with your point that our understanding of history is not supported by the archaeological or geologic record, okay?
[01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:10.451]  It's just fake.
[01:22:11.452 --> 01:22:15.654]  I'm not sure what the truth is, but clearly the story we were told is not true.
[01:22:16.094 --> 01:22:26.094]  So there's that. By the way, interrupt real quick. Did you know the WEF is running around the world suppressing hundreds of archaeological digs with the UN right now where they're now saying the environmental thing to do is not dig up this?
[01:22:26.094 --> 01:22:30.094]  You just said it, but why don't they want this dug up? I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead.
[01:22:30.094 --> 01:22:34.094]  No, I didn't know that, but that's absolutely perfect.
[01:22:34.094 --> 01:22:37.453]  There has been...
[01:22:35.585 --> 01:22:37.448]  It just tells you a lot.
[01:22:37.548 --> 01:22:46.521]  There's been an extraordinary effort on the part of various authorities over the last hundred or so years to suppress and distort archaeology.
[01:22:47.622 --> 01:22:48.683]  And now DNA testing.
[01:22:49.123 --> 01:22:50.664]  And I find that really interesting.
[01:22:50.744 --> 01:22:52.085]  Why do they care, actually?
[01:22:52.205 --> 01:22:57.689]  Why would you care what we learn about the world two or three thousand, five thousand years ago?
[01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:58.689]  Why is that a threat to you?
[01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.550]  But it is.
[01:23:00.731 --> 01:23:09.196]  In the same sense that all government propaganda about UAPs, UFOs, has one point, and that's to deny the existence of the supernatural.
[01:23:09.236 --> 01:23:10.017]  Well, why is that?
[01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.599]  You know, that's the message.
[01:23:12.619 --> 01:23:22.911]  If there's one message from the propaganda from the various federal agencies and journalism companies involved in lying about UAPs, it's the supernatural is not real.
[01:23:22.951 --> 01:23:24.092]  Why do they want us to believe that?
[01:23:24.813 --> 01:23:25.233]  I don't know.
[01:23:27.094 --> 01:23:28.615]  But it's very revealing.
[01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:31.717]  The lies themselves are always the key to the truth.
[01:23:32.237 --> 01:23:34.818]  What do all of their lies have in common?
[01:23:34.878 --> 01:23:35.979]  What's the message here?
[01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:37.620]  What do they want me to believe?
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.802]  And you're probably not going to go broke betting on the opposite being true, I would say.
[01:23:42.703 --> 01:23:45.024]  But as for where we are in history, it's unknowable.
[01:23:45.124 --> 01:23:46.625]  And if you're a Christian, you will notice.
[01:23:47.465 --> 01:23:56.549]  In all the prophetic apocalyptic writings in the Bible, which I've read, there is consistently a warning to people reading these, like, you don't know, actually.
[01:23:57.329 --> 01:24:00.290]  And the end of history comes, I think I'm quoting, like a thief in the night.
[01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:00.850]  Like, you don't know.
[01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:03.091]  If you knew, like, you would have probably a different response.
[01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:09.413]  So I think it's important to go into this question on, as all questions, with the knowledge of your limitations.
[01:24:09.673 --> 01:24:12.434]  You know, like, you're probably not going to figure out when the end of history is coming.
[01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:17.097]   But clearly, We're in the middle of a pivot, like clearly.
[01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:24.082]  And clearly the stakes are bigger than like who runs the executive branch of government, like way bigger than that.
[01:24:24.162 --> 01:24:25.824]  They're the future of the world.
[01:24:25.844 --> 01:24:30.647]  The last thing I will say is I think it's really important to understand what they hate.
[01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:33.109]  Most of all, they hate a lot of different things.
[01:24:33.129 --> 01:24:34.430]  They hate working class whites.
[01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:35.671]  They hate tobacco.
[01:24:36.131 --> 01:24:36.812]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:36.832 --> 01:24:38.553]  They hate testosterone.
[01:24:38.613 --> 01:24:39.334]  They have a lot of hates.
[01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:40.334]  These are hateful people.
[01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:40.835]  They're haters.
[01:24:41.601 --> 01:24:45.284]  But the thing they hate most, above all else, is Christianity.
[01:24:45.824 --> 01:24:47.445]  Not all religions, Christianity.
[01:24:47.725 --> 01:24:48.266]  That's what they hate.
[01:24:48.966 --> 01:24:50.267]  But why is that, exactly?
[01:24:50.367 --> 01:24:55.951]  Why is Christianity, which is the world's only non-violent religion, like, really?
[01:24:55.971 --> 01:24:59.694]  It's certainly, it's the world's biggest religion, and it is officially non-violent.
[01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:00.775]  Turn the other cheek.
[01:25:01.215 --> 01:25:03.537]  Someone takes your cloak, give them your shirt.
[01:25:04.443 --> 01:25:05.204]  That's the religion.
[01:25:05.504 --> 01:25:06.685]  It's the religion of peace.
[01:25:07.706 --> 01:25:08.487]  That's the threat?
[01:25:09.008 --> 01:25:09.608]  Why is that?
[01:25:09.628 --> 01:25:19.719]  In other words, if I'm a Buddhist or a Hindu or a Zoroastrian, it doesn't matter what my religion is, and I'm running a country, I want a country full of Christians.
[01:25:20.646 --> 01:25:27.128]  Because they're civic-minded, I know for a fact they're not going to foment bloody revolution against me because their religion tells them not to.
[01:25:27.528 --> 01:25:31.929]  They're peaceful, they're hard-working, they stay married, they're not out doing crazy things.
[01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:33.230]  I want Christians.
[01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:37.031]  That would be the logical, obviously the logical conclusion, right?
[01:25:37.251 --> 01:25:37.871]  Because they're just...
[01:25:38.516 --> 01:25:39.757]  They're orderly people because that's their religion.
[01:25:39.797 --> 01:25:40.478]  And why would you be against that?
[01:25:40.498 --> 01:25:41.298]  Why would you be against that?
[01:25:41.939 --> 01:25:42.859]  Not just against it.
[01:25:42.999 --> 01:25:44.681]  It's the thing that they hate most.
[01:25:44.781 --> 01:25:46.482]  It's the thing they're most threatened by.
[01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:48.224]  It's the thing that they seek to destroy.
[01:25:48.984 --> 01:25:50.585]  And you have to just ask, like, why?
[01:25:50.765 --> 01:25:51.686]  That's not rational.
[01:25:52.187 --> 01:25:55.229]  There's no sort of policy goal that's served by opposing Christianity.
[01:25:55.249 --> 01:25:55.609]  They're spiritual.
[01:25:55.909 --> 01:25:59.292]  There's only a spiritual goal that is served by opposing Christianity.
[01:26:00.132 --> 01:26:06.934]  In closing, you're the master at ever plugging all the great things you're doing, your show, your network, the great lab of integrity.
[01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:09.375]  We're going to do that in a moment, but since we bring this up, Elon Musk.
[01:26:10.015 --> 01:26:18.117]  I judge a tree by its fruits, as Christ said, and Musk is involved in all the big high-tech things that could have Trojan horses and issues, but I see him pivoting.
[01:26:18.977 --> 01:26:25.605]  From being, you know, moderately globalist to at the World Government Forum last year saying, world government's bad, it's tyranny, we're against it.
[01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:27.527]  I see him boosting free speech.
[01:26:27.587 --> 01:26:32.353]  I see him attacked by all these governments from Australia to Brazil to the EU, trying to arrest him.
[01:26:32.953 --> 01:26:41.823]   And I see him reaching hundreds, the only thing bigger than Tucker Carlson, he kind of goes, well it doesn't kind of go, it goes, It's great.
[01:26:41.843 --> 01:26:42.604]  I don't want to be number one.
[01:26:42.644 --> 01:26:45.567]  I love seeing people more articulate than me and that means we're winning.
[01:26:46.348 --> 01:26:48.270]  But you're like right below Elon Musk.
[01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:49.431]  It's true.
[01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:53.995]  The second most influential person in the world in thought today.
[01:26:54.836 --> 01:27:20.136]   Even above Joe Rogan it's not a contest it's just you have to recognize it is Tucker Carlson with all the choices you've made the things you've done and you're a humble man that's why God's given you this power but but we're there Elon Musk because I cannot bitch at a gift horse I cannot look at somebody where I'm reaching 10-15 million people a day on X and I'm not being censored and the real me can be seen and they're like well he's doing this he's doing that but you know Elon what you Give us a few minutes on Elon Musk, because I think he needs to be protected and defended.
[01:27:20.497 --> 01:27:21.458]  He's in a lot of danger.
[01:27:21.518 --> 01:27:26.043]  He's really stuck his neck out there, and I think we're idiots if we don't back him.
[01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:31.417]  Well, I think the first thing you said is the truest thing.
[01:27:31.597 --> 01:27:33.557]  Judge a tree by its fruits, you know?
[01:27:33.757 --> 01:27:35.237]  Anyone who's not against me is for me.
[01:27:35.778 --> 01:27:38.378]  And look, I kind of gave up.
[01:27:38.778 --> 01:27:41.179]  Here I've been talking about motives and what motivates people.
[01:27:41.239 --> 01:27:42.879]  The truth is it's pretty hard to know.
[01:27:42.899 --> 01:27:44.979]  I don't even understand my own motives a lot of the time.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:45.820]  I act on instinct.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.720]  Action matters!
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.600]  Action matters!
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.861]  My grandfather used to tell my dad, I don't want to hear talk, I want to see action.
[01:27:53.444 --> 01:27:56.986]  Well, and if I'm trying to judge someone, I judge him by his actions.
[01:27:57.026 --> 01:27:58.907]  Stop telling me you're a great person.
[01:27:59.248 --> 01:28:00.248]  Show me whom you've helped.
[01:28:00.388 --> 01:28:01.729]  Like, it's kind of that simple for me.
[01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:11.695]  And I think Elon has done an extraordinary thing by opening up X to, you know, greater speech, freer speech.
[01:28:12.196 --> 01:28:13.136]  I mean, it's just extraordinary.
[01:28:13.176 --> 01:28:13.757]  It's extraordinary.
[01:28:13.837 --> 01:28:17.139]  And you notice it immediately in the downstream effects are super obvious.
[01:28:17.839 --> 01:28:25.966]  People are less afraid to say what they think is true, as compared to last year, certainly as compared to three years ago, when people literally couldn't even ask.
[01:28:26.626 --> 01:28:28.228]  Like, how?
[01:28:28.488 --> 01:28:30.750]  I mean, I have a friend who's injured by the vax.
[01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:31.831]  I'm afraid to say that?
[01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:32.231]  Really?
[01:28:32.251 --> 01:28:38.596]  A medicine that you forced me to take hurt me, and I'm too afraid to say that out loud?
[01:28:38.616 --> 01:28:41.599]  Like, that's a crazy level of fear.
[01:28:41.759 --> 01:28:43.721]  And I feel like that has really evaporated.
[01:28:44.341 --> 01:28:46.861]  And I think Elon Musk is the main reason.
[01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:53.683]  Opening up X for people to, you know, have unauthorized thoughts like that, it just frees everybody.
[01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:54.163]  It's revolutionary.
[01:28:54.183 --> 01:28:54.883]  It's an inspiration.
[01:28:54.903 --> 01:29:02.985]  In the same way the United States was an inspiration to the world for a hundred years, post-World War I, because we had liberal democracy and market capitalism and it seemed to kind of work.
[01:29:03.305 --> 01:29:06.885]  And everyone's like, oh yeah, I don't want to just buy the Coca-Cola and the Levi's.
[01:29:07.385 --> 01:29:10.046]  I want the system that produced the Coca-Cola and the Levi's.
[01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:13.907]  We didn't even need a State Department or a USIA to make that case.
[01:29:13.947 --> 01:29:15.707]  People just watched and they're like, yeah, that works.
[01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:16.227]  I want it.
[01:29:17.068 --> 01:29:21.469]  And I think that freedom of speech and creativity are exactly the same.
[01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:24.009]  You know, I don't want to hear a lecture about creativity.
[01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:30.771]  If I look at you and I'm like, that person is a free thinker who's creative and that's joyful and productive and great.
[01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:34.652]  In fact, it's holy, which it is, then I want some of that.
[01:29:34.732 --> 01:29:35.552]  It inspires me.
[01:29:35.572 --> 01:29:37.453]  It gives me heart, courage.
[01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:43.369]   Yeah, so… Well, in closing, talking about Elon, he's putting out the actuaries and numbers about
[01:29:43.369 --> 01:29:46.769]  the collapse of the Western world, people not having children.
[01:29:46.769 --> 01:29:47.769]  The globalists are the opposite.
[01:29:47.769 --> 01:29:50.250]  They're saying humans are over, there's no human future.
[01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.769]  You all know Harari, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[01:29:52.769 --> 01:29:58.050]   He is directly saying to them, "You're going to destroy civilization and you're going to destroy yourself in the process.
[01:29:58.050 --> 01:29:59.050]  We must stop you."
[01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:03.550]  He has, whatever reason he did it, he's made the decision to pivot to pro-humanity.
[01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:04.550]  He agreed with me.
[01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:06.090]  I said, "We should call this Team Humanity."
[01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:09.550]  I said, "Yeah, let's call this Team Humanity" and interviewed with him.
[01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:10.550]  That is so profound.
[01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:11.550]  That is so powerful.
[01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:17.029]   Tucker, I know you've been very gracious, you've got more to do today, you've given us an hour and a half.
[01:30:17.029 --> 01:30:21.311]   In closing, because you… You're the master of everything except promoting the great work you're doing.
[01:30:21.712 --> 01:30:24.913]  And I think if you got behind promoting yourself, and I'm not criticizing you, it'd be even bigger.
[01:30:25.333 --> 01:30:26.354]  Tell us about your show.
[01:30:26.414 --> 01:30:27.874]  Tell us about your TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:30:28.155 --> 01:30:33.557]  Tell us about the speaking tour, because these are like mini Trump rallies, which are going to be bigger than his in many cases.
[01:30:35.718 --> 01:30:37.099]  Because they're trying to put him in jail.
[01:30:37.139 --> 01:30:42.561]  He could be in jail coming up in September and October and November when you've got this big tour.
[01:30:42.581 --> 01:30:45.042]  I know you're adding dates all the time and I'm going to be involved in some.
[01:30:45.343 --> 01:30:46.283]  Well, we'll just leave it at that.
[01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:47.183]  I'm so honored to be there.
[01:30:47.544 --> 01:30:51.926]  But these are important free speech rituals that the enemy is so upset about.
[01:30:51.966 --> 01:30:54.427]  So please tell us a few minutes about everything.
[01:30:54.447 --> 01:30:59.449]  Tucker Carlson, the Tucker Carlson Network, and now everybody needs to not just say, oh, Tucker's so big, he's going to handle it.
[01:30:59.469 --> 01:31:01.270]  No, we need to magnify what you're doing.
[01:31:03.928 --> 01:31:06.250]  I said sure I'd be happy to, but actually it pains me.
[01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:09.213]  Can I say one thing about... Yeah, why won't you talk about yourself?
[01:31:09.253 --> 01:31:10.514]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:31:10.595 --> 01:31:11.596]  I will, I will, I will.
[01:31:11.636 --> 01:31:13.177]  Because I'm a wasp, I hate this.
[01:31:13.257 --> 01:31:15.800]  It's like getting a prostate exam for me.
[01:31:17.581 --> 01:31:25.509]  Let me just say that that's kind of the nub of everything, Elon's point about birth rates, because it is once again a binary.
[01:31:25.549 --> 01:31:30.671]   You're either the sort of person who dreams about killing Extinguishing life?
[01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:32.632]  Or the kind of person who dreams about creating life?
[01:31:32.932 --> 01:31:35.234]  I mean, it's really a very simple choice.
[01:31:35.974 --> 01:31:40.137]  And if you're not reproducing, then you're dying.
[01:31:40.957 --> 01:31:44.279]  And the idea of embracing that is so unnatural, so grotesque.
[01:31:44.299 --> 01:31:45.580]  I mean, there's nothing greater.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.181]  Everyone's supposedly obsessed with sex.
[01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:47.762]  Well, what is sex?
[01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:49.883]  It's the beginning of the creation of life.
[01:31:50.123 --> 01:31:51.704]  That's why we're driven to do it.
[01:31:52.145 --> 01:31:53.085]  Because there's nothing greater.
[01:31:53.105 --> 01:31:54.226]  There's nothing more fulfilling.
[01:31:54.246 --> 01:31:55.667]  There's nothing more inherently meaningful.
[01:31:56.027 --> 01:32:02.167]   than creating life or being present when God creates it through the acts of sex like it's the greatest thing that there is and then
[01:32:02.167 --> 01:32:06.627]   children of course are part of you there's no greater achievement than having children there's
[01:32:06.627 --> 01:32:12.346]   no more enduring joy than having it's beyond magic you and a woman you love have great pleasure and interface
[01:32:12.346 --> 01:32:18.907]   and then merge your genetics to create this wonderful new creature that is the this it's freaking everything I mean God is there you see
[01:32:18.907 --> 01:32:22.146]   the perfection unbelievable yes exactly
[01:32:22.248 --> 01:32:22.929]  God is there.
[01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:28.774]  So, you know, you find people who don't have a chance to have children or don't realize its importance until it's too late.
[01:32:28.794 --> 01:32:29.815]  I mean, that's always the case.
[01:32:30.355 --> 01:32:31.976]  Or the society is, you know, having problems.
[01:32:31.996 --> 01:32:34.719]  And the left's so mad they don't have kids, they want to take it away from us.
[01:32:34.779 --> 01:32:40.724]  Notice, those that don't have kids form the core of the globalist death cult because they're pissed they didn't have it, they want to take it away.
[01:32:41.943 --> 01:32:47.105]  But they're literally, it's more than just like some people don't have kids, it's like they're promoting not having kids.
[01:32:47.665 --> 01:32:54.268]  By promoting, you know, the LBGTQ three-spirit agenda, of course, that's what that is.
[01:32:54.288 --> 01:33:00.770]  It's not about tolerating people who are different, which almost every American is just instinctively happy to do, very much including me.
[01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:02.791]  No, it's promoting childlessness.
[01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:07.492]  It's the end of family, the end of children, the end of reproduction, the end of humanity.
[01:33:07.532 --> 01:33:08.433]  It's anti-life.
[01:33:09.174 --> 01:33:13.616]  And the opposite of that is pro-life, not just opposing abortion, which you should do because it's killing.
[01:33:14.443 --> 01:33:16.484]  But more broadly, I'm for reproduction.
[01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.284]  I'm for babies.
[01:33:18.124 --> 01:33:20.524]  And I just think it's kind of that clear.
[01:33:20.544 --> 01:33:32.147]  And if you find yourself on the side that's against people, against babies, against reproducing, against reproductive sex, against joy, human connection, like you're on the wrong side, actually.
[01:33:32.167 --> 01:33:33.528]  And there's sort of no arguing it.
[01:33:34.068 --> 01:33:34.648]  Okay, I'll stop.
[01:33:34.808 --> 01:33:47.366]   As to what I'm doing, everything to me is about getting What I believe out there, disseminating a message, what I think is true, if it's false, of course I'll correct, which I have many times.
[01:33:48.087 --> 01:33:52.748]  It's like I have a monopoly on truth, but I really believe what I say, and I want people to hear it, if they want to.
[01:33:53.168 --> 01:33:54.269]  I want them to have the chance to do that.
[01:33:54.289 --> 01:34:02.891]  So censorship is the single biggest obstacle, not simply to my job, but to human freedom and flourishing.
[01:34:02.991 --> 01:34:03.892]  I really believe that.
[01:34:04.332 --> 01:34:07.973]  So everything we do is designed to get around the censors.
[01:34:08.533 --> 01:34:13.756]  Watching what's happening to you right now actually affects my sleep, because I think it's the worst thing.
[01:34:13.796 --> 01:34:17.237]  It's the beginning of enslavement of our country.
[01:34:17.657 --> 01:34:20.038]  So anyway, I've done two things to get around censorship.
[01:34:20.259 --> 01:34:24.140]  One is to build a subscription service that is not dependent on advertising.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.421]  It's TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:34:25.441 --> 01:34:31.565]   You subscribe and So our audience pays, not very much, but they pay for what they get.
[01:34:31.785 --> 01:34:33.606]  They support our business.
[01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:37.049]  So we cannot have the legs kicked out from under us by some advertiser.
[01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:40.311]  Toyota can't call up and be like, oh my gosh, you questioned January 6th?
[01:34:40.391 --> 01:34:41.332]  We're pulling our ads!
[01:34:41.352 --> 01:34:42.452]  And then you have to fire everybody.
[01:34:42.773 --> 01:34:44.114]  I've lived in that world for 30 years.
[01:34:44.214 --> 01:34:45.014]  I'm never doing that again.
[01:34:45.034 --> 01:34:52.400]  So it gives you total independence and they're like missionaries backing you, like families of fun missionaries to go out and then reach hundreds of millions of people.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:53.841]  Exactly.
[01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:55.783]  That's exactly what it's like, though.
[01:34:55.803 --> 01:35:00.768]  I don't, you know, I'm not going to redeem anyone's soul, but I'm going to try to tell the truth my absolute hardest, no matter what.
[01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.870]  OK, so there's that.
[01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:07.376]  Second thing we're doing this fall is taking it on the road in live events.
[01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:12.061]  You can't, you know, Google has no control over a stadium speech.
[01:35:12.661 --> 01:35:18.685]  You don't, they can't rearrange the search results when you're speaking live on stage to people who paid a ticket to be there.
[01:35:18.745 --> 01:35:23.749]  Now, you do have problems with venues that come under enormous pressure.
[01:35:23.789 --> 01:35:27.191]  CNN is trying to shut down this tour, which is crazy.
[01:35:27.231 --> 01:35:31.614]  When I worked at CNN 20 years ago, 25 years ago, it was a, pretended to be a news organization.
[01:35:32.014 --> 01:35:38.499]  They weren't in the business of preventing people from getting information, but now, of course, that's their only mission.
[01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.400]  But anyway, I don't think it's going to work.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:49.966]  And by the way, if every single venue pulls out because CNN demands it, because I questioned the VAX or something, then we'll just do it in a field with loudspeakers.
[01:35:50.327 --> 01:35:51.127]  I'm doing it.
[01:35:51.447 --> 01:35:52.108]  I love it.
[01:35:52.348 --> 01:35:52.728]  I mean it.
[01:35:52.888 --> 01:35:53.649]  I mean it, too.
[01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:58.412]  If we have to get a tent or stand in the rain and yell, I will do it.
[01:35:58.792 --> 01:36:06.657]   And we're doing it from California To the East Coast, from New York to California and everywhere in between the entire month of September, probably some of October.
[01:36:06.677 --> 01:36:08.859]  We've got 15 dates, probably doing more.
[01:36:08.899 --> 01:36:10.920]  The tickets of all the pre-sales are gone.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.461]  I think they go on sale tomorrow-ish.
[01:36:14.422 --> 01:36:16.443]  But sales are great, so I think we're going to add more.
[01:36:16.703 --> 01:36:21.266]  And every city, you know, bring someone, including you.
[01:36:21.326 --> 01:36:22.327]  I'm grateful that you're doing it.
[01:36:23.227 --> 01:36:32.374]  Um, Russell Brand, you know, every people who you know and take seriously and love in some cases will be coming up and on stage at every event.
[01:36:32.494 --> 01:36:33.735]  And I think it's going to be amazing.
[01:36:34.015 --> 01:36:41.061]  And last thing I'll say, and I will stop now because I can't stop talking once I get going, is I want to see America like I I'm from here.
[01:36:41.821 --> 01:36:42.401]  I grew up here.
[01:36:42.421 --> 01:36:43.041]  I was born here.
[01:36:43.061 --> 01:36:43.882]  I'm never leaving here.
[01:36:43.962 --> 01:36:45.002]  It's the only passport I have.
[01:36:45.282 --> 01:36:47.723]  And I think the physical country matters.
[01:36:47.823 --> 01:36:49.484]  I don't like all this America is an idea.
[01:36:49.684 --> 01:36:49.944]  Really?
[01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:50.484]  No.
[01:36:51.064 --> 01:36:53.785]  Ideas can be changed in a generation.
[01:36:53.805 --> 01:36:55.485]  You know what can't be changed in a generation?
[01:36:55.906 --> 01:36:59.407]  The Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, the forests of northern New England.
[01:36:59.507 --> 01:37:05.289]   I want to see the country Oh, the globalists are at war with rural people and the forgotten people and they love you.
[01:37:05.309 --> 01:37:14.371]  I love the fact that, because they're desperate to shut this down because this is going to be like a whole other Trump campaign, but with an even, I'm not putting Trump down, an even better speaker.
[01:37:14.911 --> 01:37:16.872]  And hey, I'm so blessed to be involved in the dates.
[01:37:16.992 --> 01:37:17.672]  Anything you want.
[01:37:18.072 --> 01:37:19.773]  Your crew's like, oh, thanks for agreeing to come.
[01:37:19.853 --> 01:37:21.393]  I'm like, thanks for agreeing?
[01:37:24.034 --> 01:37:25.335]  It's gonna be so fun!
[01:37:25.875 --> 01:37:29.818]  It's gonna be so fun and then you get, I mean everyone always talks about America, America, America.
[01:37:30.198 --> 01:37:31.258]  Let's go see America.
[01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:32.559]  I'm serious.
[01:37:32.659 --> 01:37:34.600]  Like let's go to 20 states and see how people are doing.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.561]  Like what does it look like?
[01:37:36.212 --> 01:37:37.492]  You know, that matters to me.
[01:37:37.613 --> 01:37:39.173]  Physical reality matters to me.
[01:37:39.213 --> 01:37:40.173]  It's why I love nature.
[01:37:40.193 --> 01:37:41.074]  It's why I love animals.
[01:37:41.134 --> 01:37:42.054]  It's why I love my wife.
[01:37:42.094 --> 01:37:42.854]  These aren't ideas.
[01:37:42.894 --> 01:37:43.555]  These are things.
[01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:44.935]  These are living things.
[01:37:45.715 --> 01:37:49.637]  And I want to see the living thing that is America and the 350 million people who live here.
[01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:50.277]  I want to know.
[01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:51.737]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:37:51.817 --> 01:37:53.478]  I don't like, I'm sick of all the theories.
[01:37:53.938 --> 01:37:55.759]  I want to smell the reality.
[01:37:56.818 --> 01:37:57.258]  Exactly.
[01:37:57.298 --> 01:37:58.799]  Not just smell the coffee, smell the reality.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.801]  Tucker, thank you for the time.
[01:38:00.861 --> 01:38:01.481]  We love you.
[01:38:01.841 --> 01:38:02.402]  We appreciate it.
[01:38:02.422 --> 01:38:03.362]  Can't wait to see you on the road.
[01:38:03.382 --> 01:38:04.103]  We'll be watching you.
[01:38:04.123 --> 01:38:05.364]  We're trying to stop World War III.
[01:38:05.904 --> 01:38:08.126]  Thank you so much and God bless you for the time.
[01:38:09.787 --> 01:38:10.327]  God bless.
[01:38:10.407 --> 01:38:10.827]  Thank you.
[01:38:11.148 --> 01:38:11.808]  Good luck, man.
[01:38:11.848 --> 01:38:12.529]  Don't hang up, Tucker.
[01:38:12.549 --> 01:38:13.689]  After this is over, I want to say bye to you.
[01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:15.350]  Folks, incredible interview.

[01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:35.737]  The one thing we know for certain is the United States is going to be one intense place this fall moving into this presidential election.
[01:38:35.898 --> 01:38:39.601]  So we thought, what better time to hit the road and see the country?
[01:38:39.661 --> 01:38:41.163]  And we're going to this fall.
[01:38:41.443 --> 01:38:43.185]  We are pleased, in fact, thrilled.
[01:38:43.305 --> 01:38:56.332]  To announce Tucker Carlson Live, which is what it sounds like, a nationwide tour that at every show will be joined by a friend, a special guest, Megyn Kelly, Glenn Beck, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy, Russell Brand, and many others.
[01:38:56.392 --> 01:39:00.154]  We're going to be live on stage responding to everything that is happening in real time.

[01:39:10.118 --> 01:39:19.599]  Many years ago I coined the term 360 win.
[01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:22.810]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:27.932]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[01:39:28.352 --> 01:39:34.235]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360Win.
