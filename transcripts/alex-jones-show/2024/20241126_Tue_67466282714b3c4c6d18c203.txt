[00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:28.109]  It is Tuesday, November 26. Apple was the first company to remove Alex Jones' hateful anti-government conspiratorial rants from their platform.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.060]  And other tech companies, as we know, followed their lead.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:44.420]  We have the ADL that is openly the arbiter with big tech and the censors on who can be online, who can basically in the future with a social credit score even have a job.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.939]  You're going to be put into ghettos and then into camps under their admitted plans.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.140]  Whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed, we're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system.
[00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.570]  The head of the ADL put out a letter attacking Elon Musk and saying you will not reinstate President Trump.
[00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.710]  He is a danger and a terrorist.
[00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:09.829]  And they went on to say Alex Jones is the other big enemy and he must not be allowed back on Twitter.
[00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:17.390]  I am worried about the social credit score, the debanking that's coming for everybody in the next phase of this real tyranny.
[00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.989]  You talk about clear and present danger.
[00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:27.790]  We're talking about the ability to track and trace and surveil upon subjects from the cradle to the grave, effectively.
[00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:44.590]  From the beginning of your life or your children's lives or your grandchildren's lives, they'll have biometric Identity markers placed on you and connected with this digital ID and then all records about all activity will be associated with it.
[00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.650]  This is not simply some identification.
[00:01:48.109 --> 00:02:00.140]  This is a database that is kept in a centralized place by the state And then is a collection of all activities from the beginning of your life onward.
[00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.159]  Why is it so important that we're on the air?
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.879]  Why is it so important your backing of the few oases of truth and freedom?
[00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:20.819]  Because as things get worse and worse, As the New World Order comes out in the open, people are hungering for the truth more than ever, and the globalists know if we stay on air and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.560]  We will win.
[00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.659]  They will go to prison.
[00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.080]  They will be defeated.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:55.680]  That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential, that you continue in the face of censorship and everything that's going on by word of mouth, by text message, by email, by the side of your barn, the back of your car, calling you to talk radio, calling you to C-SPAN. Frankly, what I'm focused on today is building the united front against what,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.879]  and this is not hyperbole, what to me is U.S. fascism.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.199]  That's your chat with a few callers.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.000]  John's up first out of Austin, Texas.
[00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.500]  Independent, good morning.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.919]  Good morning.
[00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.599]  Yeah, I'm listening to Mr. Mitchell here, just as an American.
[00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:21.699]  And I'm wondering how it is that Trump is a cult and the Democratic Party isn't a cult when they've already instituted socialism, they've flirted with communism.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.840]  And you talk about fascism, we can talk a lot about the Democratic Party and their neo-fascist views.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.319]  So why is it that you want to bring the country together, yet you want to take this extreme side?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.680]  The Republican Party has been captured by a political cult.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.379]  I don't use those words lightly.
[00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.199]  Aligning to cult things.
[00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.879]  You can go back to Obama administration, but I would also go with more recent history.
[00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:56.060]  You've got the Black Lives Matter, the Antifa siding with Democrats, the cities were burned down, people were murdered.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.000]  It seems very cult-like.
[00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:09.219]  We've got the Biden administration with pharmaceutical companies spending billions of dollars, right, on vaccines that went from 100% efficacy to 40% efficacy, and they're making billions of dollars.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.659]  We've had free speech taken away.
[00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:12.870]  Plymouth, Michigan.
[00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.870]  This is Janice, line for Republicans.
[00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.409]  Good morning.
[00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310]  Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.
[00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.930]  There are none so blind as those who cannot see.
[00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.410]  Let me give you a little piece of advice.
[00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:45.230]  You will never succeed in your goal by insulting half the country and calling them fascists, racists, So that's political violence that you're talking about that Republicans and ultramagas are doing.
[00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.670]  It doesn't exist.
[00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.850]  It's a lie.
[00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.069]  It is a lie.
[00:04:49.329 --> 00:05:01.850]  There was political violence in our country in the summer of 2020. Wherever you can be heard, know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million, you're going to win the fight.
[00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.019]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, all of Balance Great Reports and more are at Banned Out Video.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.879]  We're about to come back live with the biggest World War III news yet.
[00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.540]  I can't even believe it's gotten this bad.
[00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.379]  We are fighting for the very survival of the human species.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.899]  Our entire future hangs in the balance.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.459]  It is Tuesday.
[00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:39.870]  November 26, 2024. We are 54 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, 18 seconds to the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States,
[00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.129]  Donald John Trump.
[00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.589]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled Infowars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.110]  Hated by tyrants, loved by patriots across the world.
[00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.290]  We are the resistance.
[00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.209]  We are the Infowar.
[00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.529]  We are the answer to 1984. We are 1776!
[00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.160]  What an epic time to be alive.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.120]  I'm going to shoot you straight right now.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.899]  You see all this news?
[00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.379]  Every bit of it is absolutely vital.
[00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:27.139]  And I will cover it all, even if it's just going to be briefly in some of these areas, because we've got to get the big picture here.
[00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:43.079]  But, obviously, the minute-by-minute mass escalation into total war with Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran by the captured West Is the central issue.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.639]  The developments, since I went off the air at 3 p.m.
[00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:58.100]  Central yesterday, and we filed special reports on those developments, could only be called hyperacceleration.
[00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:09.290]  When you look at all the pieces, it's not 90% fact that we're already in World War III. It's not 95% fact.
[00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:21.990]  It is 100% that NATO and the United States of America have offensively started the war in Ukraine in the last 14 years.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.660]  And are bombing Russia and doing the most provocative things.
[00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.819]  Oh, we're going to give nukes to Ukraine.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.459]  Two days ago as we're thinking about it.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.639]  Now, no, we're going to do it.
[00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:40.120]  And then England and France come out and say, we're getting ready to send troops in.
[00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:40.800]  They're already there.
[00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:44.060]  But Germany, 800,000 troops ready to go in.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.259]  Sweden, Germany, the UK, all get ready for nuclear war.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.100]  TV announcements to the public.
[00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:55.170]  Get a week of food and water, as if that's going to help us.
[00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:07.970]  This is the globalist establishment coming to the end of its power worldwide, holding a thermal nuclear gun collectively to the human species head.
[00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:09.930]  Then it gets worse.
[00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:30.899]  The head of the NATO War Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, in his little naval uniform, Came out and said, we should prepare a total sneak attack on the Russians.
[00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:35.700]  And I'll show you the quotes, all of it, mainstream news.
[00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:43.820]  Knowing that Russia has said, you keep rolling these hypersonic missiles up to our border, you're hitting us with them now with conventional weapons.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.000]  We know you can load hydrogen bombs on those in 10 minutes.
[00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:56.559]  If you keep firing them at us, it may be a sneak attack under your doctrine as well.
[00:08:57.159 --> 00:09:01.179]  They said this to the Pentagon and to NATO. You would nuke us for this.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.759]  Why are you doing this?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.879]  And then it gets worse.
[00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:23.960]  The Pentagon comes out last night and today in official statements of the White House to the Pentagon John Kirby And there's Admiral Bauer right there.
[00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:42.529]  And says, we stand rock solid in Article 5 joint defense of NATO. And if Russia responds to any of this in any way, we are going to full Article 5,
[00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.110]  which means total official war with Russia.
[00:09:46.289 --> 00:09:53.490]  They know in the polls, over 80% of Europeans and Americans and people around the world do not want this war.
[00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:58.230]  So they have sleptwalked us by increments into it.
[00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.309]  And on every threat analysis and every war game and every...
[00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:12.009]  Threat escalation metric ladder used by the United States, used by NATO, used by Russia, used by China.
[00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.389]  We are already at war with Russia and its allies.
[00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:30.370]  And I told you that last week, and I said within 48 hours you'll start seeing that, and now it's in the Hill, and it's in Politico, and it's being stated by the Ukrainian government that World War III has begun.
[00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:39.190]  The only question is, will it follow to its illogical conclusion of the surface of the earth being unlivable?
[00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.769]  And most of us sitting here right now comfortably being dead.
[00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:53.929]  So, you can ask the question, is this nuclear brinksmanship?
[00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:58.129]  Is this the ultimate con game by the arrogant?
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:12.580]  Psychotic megalomaniacs believing in their normalcy bias and their delusions that Russia is bluffing?
[00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:20.980]  Or are they really wanting to depopulate at least 8 billion people in a nuclear war?
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.539]  And that's what most estimates are, 90 plus percent death rate.
[00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.480]  Five billion in a big nuclear war.
[00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.159]  Most estimates die in the first day.
[00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.379]  Then another three billion in the next year.
[00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.360]  And no movie, no book, no novel of a dystopic collapsed civilization.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.799]  Not Viggo Mortensen's The Road.
[00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:44.600]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:55.299]  In your mind or my mind can even imagine what billions of starving people running around look like.
[00:11:56.309 --> 00:12:04.850]  But it makes World War Z look like a cakewalk in all the studies and estimates by the Pentagon and others.
[00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:06.450]  You can read them.
[00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.350]  I've shown you the estimates, the studies.
[00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:13.549]  Just type in, Pentagon study, within 15 days, most people become cannibals.
[00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:29.639]  Brain chips, flash mobs, world government, a grim future prospectus by the Ministry of Defense, UK. Just type in what I say.
[00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:30.600]  You'll read it for yourself.
[00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:31.240]  From them.
[00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:33.919]  So, you can just sit there and just type in whatever I say.
[00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:35.500]  Do your own for yourself.
[00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:39.620]  Because basically everything I say, 99% of it's public source.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.100]  I'm kind of the original chat GPT of geopolitics.
[00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:46.139]  So...
[00:12:53.350 --> 00:13:03.710]  Everybody is going to probably be sitting around watching a football game Thursday, eating some turkey and stuffing and maybe having a whiskey.
[00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.809]  I know I won't be doing that.
[00:13:07.929 --> 00:13:08.889]  The world's too dangerous.
[00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.730]  Things are too serious.
[00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.210]  We're not in playtime right now.
[00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.769]  But most of you will, and I'm not blaming you.
[00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.889]  You deserve a little rest, a little time with the family.
[00:13:18.049 --> 00:13:18.570]  It's a good holiday.
[00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.570]  It's the best holiday other than Christmas, in my view, in America.
[00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:31.629]  I will be mainly working on Thanksgiving because I love my children.
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:40.090]  And you can bet in the globalist sick mindset, they're going to pull some real nasty crap on Thanksgiving.
[00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:52.990]  I'm predicting right now that the globalists launch a massive bombardment on Thanksgiving and that you wake up to hell.
[00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:14.539]  Now I say that, hopefully, and I'm going to walk through this so some cooler minds prevail, and this doesn't happen, but General Flynn is a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and was well known for having the best intelligence, but he'll tell you, and he said this yesterday, it's his gut.
[00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:17.139]  But the gut is really the spirit.
[00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:20.679]  That's the spiritual component, the electrochemical component.
[00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:23.789]  Ether, jacking into that.
[00:14:24.289 --> 00:14:27.990]  The group consciousness, the collective, whatever you want to call it, it's scientifically there.
[00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:29.490]  You can quantify it however you want.
[00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.470]  You can try to define it.
[00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.309]  It's been proven it's there, but there's a big debate about how it works.
[00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:47.850]  And then you take all the millions of data points you study, when you study, and the subconscious and unconscious is hundreds and hundreds of times more powerful than the cerebral cortex narrow focus.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.460]  That you need to be able to operate, but the deeper mind is way more powerful.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:06.559]  And that's why the best famous police detectives and generals and strategists will tell you, I don't know how I know, but my gut says this.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:15.000]  And then the more time goes on, the more they learn to be confident in their deep research, focus, meditation, prayer.
[00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.590]  They're never wrong.
[00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.230]  And there aren't a lot of those people in history.
[00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:29.570]  And when they are wrong, it's because people listen to them enough that you're able to change the future.
[00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:31.990]  Now, Flynn can do that.
[00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.009]  He was known for that in the military.
[00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:36.129]  That's why he was the head of all U.S. military intelligence.
[00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:40.149]  And I'm able to do that.
[00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:44.169]  But we have reached such an insane point.
[00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:48.049]  You don't need to be a brainiac To know where we're at.
[00:15:48.669 --> 00:15:57.070]  Yeah, we told you years ago, there's videos of me 14 years ago when the CIA overthrew the Ukrainian government, and we played it a month ago, somebody found it.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:14.519]  And I predict that that's where they try to trigger World War III by a proxy war and then moving missiles up to the border of Russia and then trying to manipulate Russia into a response so the globalists can claim in the history books that Russia started World War III. And that's where we are.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.700]  So it's easy to call it now.
[00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:30.799]  And the reason I explain I called it 14 years ago and 10 years ago and 5 years ago and 2 1⁄2 years ago and Three years ago, right at this time of year, I said the Russians will invade in late February.
[00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:33.200]  And they did.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.279]  And I just do that to not impress people.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:56.389]  I do that so that you can understand that when I tell you that on the current road we're on, we will have nuclear war by Christmas, if not sooner, And of course, one of my data points is Vladimir Putin saying that last week.
[00:16:58.929 --> 00:17:01.210]  But I don't need to hear that from Vladimir Putin.
[00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:03.289]  I'd already said that as well.
[00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.329]  And I bet you my bottom dollar, Putin wasn't listening to me and didn't get that from me.
[00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:23.470]  15 minutes before Putin went live on national, international television, Last Thursday, I said I would expect Putin in the next 48 hours to come out and say, we just tested a successful nuclear attack on any NATO target we want.
[00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:33.150]  We can bypass your anti-missile defense and anti-ballistic missile defense systems, and we can deliver multiple re-entry device nuclear warheads on the new missile we just tested.
[00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:36.490]  And I didn't know 15 minutes later, he'd say word for word what I just said.
[00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.650]  It's because...
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.619]  The Russians have got smart people.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.880]  We've got smart people.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.539]  And when you get to that point of knowledge, it's stalemate.
[00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:54.880]  The only difference is, are you evil or are you good?
[00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:58.339]  Do you want to kill people in mass because you get off on it spiritually?
[00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:00.180]  Or do you want to empower humanity?
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.779]  Are you team humanity or are you team Satan?
[00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:07.059]  Whether you believe in God or not, just as an archetype.
[00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.150]  Do you believe in God and life, or do you believe in the devil and death?
[00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:19.630]  So I'll walk through all of this, and I'm not going to spend the whole show on it.
[00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.069]  I'm going to spend the first hour on it.
[00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:30.029]  And then as other stuff develops, I will cover it and get into more later in the broadcast.
[00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.670]  And there's so much news that I've gotten behind on and that's also broke.
[00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:37.190]  I've got to hit all this.
[00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:41.089]  I mean, this is all just new world order out in the open.
[00:18:42.069 --> 00:18:43.569]  Openly promoting pedophilia.
[00:18:44.069 --> 00:18:45.970]  Openly saying your children don't belong to you.
[00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:47.950]  I mean, government officials here and around the world.
[00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:53.150]  Openly Agenda 2030 banning range stoves and gasoline cars.
[00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:57.910]  Rolling out the bird flu hysteria.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:08.039]  Major, top university study that DEI causes racism and division.
[00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:09.240]  You don't need a study to know that.
[00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:11.160]  It's what it's designed for, but it's still important.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.680]  I mean, all these corporate media saying First Amendment and freedom is bad.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.940]  The mask is off.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:28.220]  And then other important First Amendment news, like Elon Musk, is considering buying MSNBC. I have had people reach out to me.
[00:19:28.319 --> 00:19:28.960]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:30.140]  And say...
[00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.950]  How can we help?
[00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:45.349]  The judge said, I want full investigations, full hearings, starting on the 9th of next month, December.
[00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.049]  And the judge said three times, no one should think a sale happened.
[00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.309]  A sale never happened.
[00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.609]  An auction didn't happen.
[00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:55.609]  They did not buy InfoWars, quote.
[00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.589]  Should not be seen as a sale, quote.
[00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:04.980]  Told ya.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.420]  I mean, we've been in the building almost two weeks since they claim they own it.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.880]  He said it's status quo the way it was before the auction.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:26.700]  The Onion and every town, Bloomberg, that funds it and runs it, that's all come out in court, does not own this.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.640]  Did not happen.
[00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.309]  And they're still on their website, Global Tetrahedon, saying they own it.
[00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.490]  We're getting ready to sue their ass.
[00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:34.910]  I know other lawyers are watching, so get ready for that.
[00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.150]  And by the way, I think you're smart enough.
[00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.210]  We're not just going to sue them.
[00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.650]  You guys all love doing stuff in your own names because you're so arrogant.
[00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:44.329]  Good job.
[00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:45.849]  Hope you enjoy it.
[00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.190]  Because I'm done being on the defense with you.
[00:20:54.539 --> 00:21:01.099]  And I prayed about this under major deep state persecution for decades, but it really intensified eight years ago.
[00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:15.480]  And God said, hold out, stay on defense in the legal stuff, and then wait till the time is right and the climate and the tide turns, and then attack.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.380]  And so now you get the offense, Alex Jones.
[00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:24.099]  Guard yourself for true.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.559]  And I want people to go to prison.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.380]  And I think you will go to prison.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.799]  So, I'm a nice guy.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.579]  I'm a fair guy.
[00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:41.759]  On guard!
[00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:51.099]  No quarter offered.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.539]  No quarter given.
[00:21:56.969 --> 00:21:57.849]  Enjoy yourselves.
[00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:06.009]  Now, yeah, it's fun to be the deep state and bully people and their families and torture people, isn't it?
[00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.670]  Well, God's got a way of dealing with you.
[00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.109]  You know that song by Johnny Cash?
[00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:22.849]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.569]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:28.549]  Politically.
[00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.990]  Legislatively.
[00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.210]  Legally.
[00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.170]  Lawfully.
[00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.190]  Peacefully.
[00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:41.000]  And it's not about revenge.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.339]  It's about justice.
[00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:51.279]  And it's about evil.
[00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:57.579]  Learning that it's a loser.
[00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:06.799]  All right.
[00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:14.579]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes, and I'm going to come back with laser focus, and I'm going to drill through everything I just told you and more.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.000]  I'm going to show you the document, show you the clip, show you the statements, everything I just said.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.059]  I'm going to show it to you.
[00:23:20.019 --> 00:23:22.339]  And then I know what you want, because it's the same thing I want.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.420]  That's my focus group analysis of the audience.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.480]  When I got sued by the deep state, they kept saying, who's the funders?
[00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:32.319]  Who's telling you what to say?
[00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:32.940]  Who's the boss?
[00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:33.579]  Who's in command?
[00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:34.579]  What foundation?
[00:23:34.759 --> 00:23:35.500]  What Republican group?
[00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:37.420]  And I said, silly kids!
[00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:41.730]  I'm in command.
[00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:59.569]  It's like in The Prisoner when you get taken off to that based on a real MI6 or OSS village in World War II. And they keep saying, who is number one?
[00:24:01.589 --> 00:24:08.509]  And you only learn at the end of the show, end of the series, keep saying, you are number two.
[00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.740]  Because they said, you're number two.
[00:24:10.859 --> 00:24:11.660]  He said, he's no longer number one.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.380]  He said himself to have his mind wiped.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.140]  You later learn that.
[00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.240]  It's all his operation.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.880]  And he keeps saying to the new number one, who am I? He says, I'm a member.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.400]  And he goes, they told him, hey, you're number two.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:25.759]  It's your number.
[00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:29.220]  And he goes, who am I? And he goes, who is number one?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.319]  And he goes, you are number two.
[00:24:35.859 --> 00:24:38.700]  He's not understanding, like, you're number one.
[00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:41.250]  And I'm not saying I'm number one.
[00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.809]  I'm saying the people are number one.
[00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.309]  Freedom is number one.
[00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.130]  And everybody gets this idea that somebody's got to be in charge.
[00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:50.490]  Somebody's got to be in the boss.
[00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:52.809]  Real leadership is leading by example.
[00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.549]  And by inspiring people, not forcing them to do things.
[00:24:57.049 --> 00:25:00.190]  So, I've been in command of Infowars.
[00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.849]  Me, the mistakes, the successes, everything.
[00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:03.549]  It's me.
[00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:07.849]  Who gives the orders like Tony Montana says in Scarface?
[00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:08.769]  Me!
[00:25:10.329 --> 00:25:11.210]  Who puts us together?
[00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:11.890]  Me!
[00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.130]  Who do I trust?
[00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:13.789]  Me!
[00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:25.769]  So, I'm going to come back and go into all of this in great detail.
[00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:33.569]  And back to what I was saying, I know what you want to know, and that's what I want to know, so we need to war game this together.
[00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:36.750]  Not just all the bad stuff that's happening.
[00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.109]  How do we stop this?
[00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.910]  Well, first we define how dangerous it is and how they want to slip us into world war, nuclear war.
[00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:44.230]  We just wake up in it.
[00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:47.210]  We force this into being the top topic.
[00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:53.109]  We share the live feed that you're watching right now on X or man.video or infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:57.430]  We call Congress.
[00:25:57.569 --> 00:25:58.450]  We call talk radio.
[00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.289]  We discuss this at Thanksgiving.
[00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:02.450]  We pray.
[00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:19.589]  And we elevate the topic and the understanding of Biden saying two years ago, you can't send them tanks and F-16s, that's World War III. Well, way past that with missiles raining down on Russia, and now, oh, let's give Ukraine nukes,
[00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.849]  and oh, let's send troops from England and the UK and...
[00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:28.190]  France...
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.799]  And then Russia, as I predicted, is going to hit Poland first, at least they've said.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.880]  That's the main military staging area in NATO. And so NATO came out and the Pentagon came out today and said, well, we're going to go to full war with you if you do that.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:57.500]  So, we'll have that discussion as well and open the phones up on how do we stop the World War III crisis.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.640]  Deep end.
[00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:02.099]  We're already in the war.
[00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:03.700]  We're already in like five feet.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.500]  Now we're going to the deep end.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.380]  And it's bottomless.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.579]  So how do we extricate ourselves and our families out of that?
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:18.799]  And then I'll intersperse all the other news when we return on this live Tuesday, November 26, 2024 transmission.
[00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:26.119]  But this is all about the globalists flexing their muscles and terrorizing the whole world into staying under their control.
[00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:46.069]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.609]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:53.430]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels over foreseen.
[00:27:54.119 --> 00:28:09.140]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening and the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party allied with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.819]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.099]  But we can't control everything individually.
[00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:16.940]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.779]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[00:28:18.819 --> 00:28:19.759]  And I've got faith.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:38.799]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and The antibiotic-resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:42.700]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.
[00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:48.000]  And they're key to keeping us on the air if InfoWars is shut down next week or if we're not shut down, continuing on here.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.519]  We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing products.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.779]  Now, we've got two new products at DrJonesNaturals.com that are staples.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.900]  They're known and amazing.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:03.200]  And these are high-quality versions of it, the best organic sources and at very, very low prices.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.240]  Two new products, introductory price, limited time, 40% off.
[00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:11.579]  And everybody needs quercetin, and everybody needs high-quality CoQ10.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.579]  And both of these are high-quality, large doses at a very low price.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:23.359]  Most competing brands, say, of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average are about $60 a bottle.
[00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:27.920]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:32.099]  And then, of course, Quercetin Max, really strong, high-powered Quercetin.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.779]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:42.000]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:42.819]  This is all on record.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.400]  This is admitted.

[00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:24.630]  Alright, we are back on this Tuesday, November 26, 2024 transmission.
[00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.170]  I'm going to lay out...
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:42.019]  Where the world is right now, already in the end of the beginning stages of world war.
[00:31:44.859 --> 00:32:06.769]  Now the Pentagon, later declassified in the 90s, that they considered the Cold War to be World War III. So this would be considered, and is being called in the white papers at the Pentagon and other think tanks, World War IV. And we are now deep into phase one of World War IV,
[00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:07.970]  technically.
[00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:12.430]  But the public doesn't understand that, so you see the news alerts, World War III has begun.
[00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.430]  You have to use the vernacular of the common folks.
[00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:30.730]  So, let me just go over the developments, and then we'll talk about what's really important, different avenues of stopping this.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:40.400]  Again, the globalist system, their old banking fraud, their old Ponzi scheme that's given them unlimited trillions in fiat currency.
[00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:45.940]  And the BlackRock Consortium is their front group, 87% of all world assets.
[00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:54.740]  And their admission that they want total social control through a computer AI, cashless society, social credit system.
[00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:57.579]  That's coming to an end.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.660]  They needed COVID to launch the new world IDs.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.480]  It didn't work the way they wanted.
[00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:04.619]  All these new systems have formed.
[00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:10.319]  Corporations, governments, individuals everywhere are not going along with their operations.
[00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:12.920]  People are waking up to the operations.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:25.380]  And so the Western globalist corporate system that preys on the West and sucks out our energy and ideas and soul and then parlays that into global domination...
[00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.630]  Domestically, the globalists are facing the greatest opposition and awakening ever.
[00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.809]  Internationally, geopolitically, they're facing that.
[00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.569]  And they admit that.
[00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.230]  And their zombie corporate media has been dead for a long time.
[00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.049]  They don't know what to do.
[00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:59.819]  And so they put us into an existential hyper-urgency with a virus they create, with a poison shot, A form of permanent martial law.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.339]  They attempted.
[00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:01.539]  It backfired everywhere.
[00:34:01.819 --> 00:34:05.759]  Triggered an acceleration of the Great Awakening that had already began to grow.
[00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:13.360]  Now it's caused an explosion and cascade of awakening that we're just in the opening phases of.
[00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:18.099]  And the tyrants see the Great Awakening exponentially growing.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:27.519]  I'd say we've achieved 5% Of the mass awakening expansion we're in.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.679]  It'll go on for another 50 years.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:46.280]  And attempts to contain that awakening, just like if you jacket an explosive inside steel or any other metal, the gases can't get out.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.519]  And when it does finally make it out, it makes the explosion way more powerful.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:04.579]  And so we have achieved in the Great Awakening and the beginning of the New Renaissance escape velocity.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:19.780]  Meaning this starship, this Falcon Heavy, this is now gotten up to 25-30,000 miles an hour.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.719]  It needs to leave the atmosphere.
[00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:24.099]  We are go!
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.820]  All lights are green.
[00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:32.239]  Deep, beautiful, pulsing, green.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.760]  And so what do you do of your evil masterminds that would make Lex Luthor blush?
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.340]  You release new viruses.
[00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:46.800]  You engage cultural infighting and divide and conquer.
[00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:49.019]  You stage false flags.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.119]  You accelerate conflicts in detonator proxy zones.
[00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:01.610]  And that's what they've done.
[00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:08.050]  It's their only move other than, look, you've already stolen all this wealth and power.
[00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.409]  People like Trump understand you're even more dangerous if you're actually all hunted down.
[00:36:16.269 --> 00:36:19.590]  We really don't want to have to do that, but you're really forcing that, aren't you?
[00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:23.489]  You're megalomaniacs.
[00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.570]  You're going to destroy the whole planet.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.019]  You've already got the power, morons.
[00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:31.500]  Oh, but you want to take people's RVs and their children's penises away.
[00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:34.880]  You want to take the swimming pools and take our minds and our health.
[00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:36.219]  You want to be God.
[00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:39.679]  You want to take our prosperity and our very souls.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:49.360]  You want total power to exercise your satanic lust upon us.
[00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:53.599]  And so...
[00:36:57.849 --> 00:36:58.750]  You're doubling down.
[00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.150]  And you started the war in Ukraine 14 years ago.
[00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:04.670]  You pushed Russia into this.
[00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:09.570]  They let the West, the globalists, the controlists go over all these red lines.
[00:37:09.869 --> 00:37:25.909]  And then, 10 years ago, the Russians invade Crimea, that's always been part of Russia, and their Black Sea port, and their main gas terminals, and say,
[00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.050]  stop now.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:42.900]  And then two and a half, almost three years ago, the Russians officially roll in to stop Ukraine becoming part of NATO and moving offensive missiles that can launch a sneak attack on Russia.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:51.840]  And now those very sneak attack missile types that Russia listed, because they can study the attack plan, they said this is for a sneak attack.
[00:37:53.869 --> 00:38:00.829]  And if we think you're going to launch a sneak attack and you start firing conventionals in, we know you could easily get us used to accepting those attacks.
[00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.650]  And then the next barrage is nuclear to take out our defense forces and our nuclear deterrent.
[00:38:08.289 --> 00:38:16.190]  And so we're seriously looking at nuking you in response, which is the doctrine of NATO and the United States.
[00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:21.050]  And Russia says your policy is you would do this to us.
[00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:25.909]  And the West says, doesn't matter.
[00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:28.409]  We've got a doctor to hit you first.
[00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.630]  And then they have the Pentagon talk about hitting Russia first.
[00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.829]  Biden talk about hitting Russia first.
[00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:37.090]  The New York Times talk about shot across the bow.
[00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.570]  Hey, we were looking to give nukes, the administration is.
[00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.769]  And then days later, yep, we're looking at it officially.
[00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.070]  And then you start firing those missiles in that could have nukes on them.
[00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:59.829]  And then you have Germany and the UK and France And Poland and all these other countries say, oh, we got troops ready to invade Ukraine and go into Russia.
[00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:11.030]  And NATO comes out yesterday at their big committee official command and says, we need to tell the public that we may just hit Russia first.
[00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.750]  In a sneak attack.
[00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:26.690]  Now, That's how Operation Barbarossa started because Hitler thought that his ally at the time, they divided up Poland between them.
[00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:33.550]  Joseph Stalin was going to launch a sneak attack on Germany and they knew that the Russians were building a giant military.
[00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:36.329]  Hundreds of thousands of tanks, aircraft, you name it.
[00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:43.250]  So Hitler launched in late 1942 Operation Barbarossa as a response.
[00:39:43.429 --> 00:39:47.030]  So this is how you start wars.
[00:39:48.769 --> 00:39:59.829]  And Russia had already figured it out, and now NATO is, yeah, we got a 20-30 year war plan with Russia no matter what, but we're going to go ahead and probably sneak attack them, maybe with nukes, in what?
[00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.789]  An unprecedented history in the nuclear age.
[00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.030]  Open.
[00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:13.469]  Attempt at provocation to get the Russians to make the first move.
[00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:26.630]  And Putin last week already fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile hitting a Ukrainian weapons factory complex and said, we've just tested hitting you with a nuclear weapon.
[00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:28.869]  We evaded your defense systems.
[00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:29.929]  We can do whatever we want.
[00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:30.610]  Stop now.
[00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:37.730]  The ultimate warning ahead of nuclear weapons, as General Flynn said yesterday, in studio.
[00:40:39.539 --> 00:40:43.480]  So, let's go over the actual articles as exhibits here.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.519]  NATO military chief warns we must strike first in a preemptive attack on Russia.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.000]  This is AP Reuters, NBC News, just everywhere.
[00:40:55.699 --> 00:41:00.599]  That is the head of NATO's military committee, Admiral Rob Bauer.
[00:41:03.519 --> 00:41:05.059]  I mean, look at this clown.
[00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:08.840]  Looks like Hunter Biden.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.360]  NATO is discussing the possibility of preemptive strikes against Russia.
[00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:24.679]  NATO disregards all etiquette in discussing possible preemptive strikes on Russia.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.460]  Labarov.
[00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:26.239]  Etiquette.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.199]  That's a nice way of putting provocations.
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.760]  I mean, look at that guy.
[00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:38.159]  I wonder what's on his laptop.
[00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.210]  That guy's on a power trip.
[00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.070]  That guy gets a thrill out of this.
[00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.449]  Guy's a punk.
[00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.829]  And I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[00:41:55.130 --> 00:42:00.210]  But if I was going to hire somebody in a movie to play the part of a guy that drives around in a clown truck kidnapping kids, it'd be him.
[00:42:01.429 --> 00:42:05.429]  Continuing, UK and France in talks to send troops to Ukraine.
[00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.590]  Biden considering sending nukes.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.440]  That's a nice headline.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:20.300]  Will Biden fund Ukraine with nuclear weapons before leaving office?
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.599]  Stahl being discussed.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.539]  Kremlin warns West on returning nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:36.239]  Discussion in the West of arming and criminal weapons is absolutely irresponsible.
[00:42:36.659 --> 00:42:46.780]  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today in response to a report in the New York Times citing officials suggesting the possibility.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.179]  That's how this all starts.
[00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:54.110]  Dmitry Medyev, U.S. giving Ukraine nukes will mean war.
[00:42:54.429 --> 00:43:02.869]  Quote, American politicians and journalists are seriously discussing the consequences of their transfer of nuclear weapons to Kiev.
[00:43:03.369 --> 00:43:14.210]  The actual transfer of such weapons can be equated with fiat complaint of an attack on our country.
[00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.110]  And you got all the pro-Ukraine war journals.
[00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.710]  Finally!
[00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.730]  On the 11th hour of Russia.
[00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.690]  Yeah, because Russia's won the war against NATO conventionally.
[00:43:26.949 --> 00:43:28.190]  Ukraine war.
[00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:41.969]  The NATO paramilitary assembly has adopted a resolution calling for Ukraine to be provided with medium-range missiles capable of striking at a distance of 1,000 to 500...
[00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.190]  1,000 to 5,500 kilometers.
[00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.429]  That's all over Russia.
[00:43:48.809 --> 00:43:56.530]  And for Ukraine to be accepted into the alliance more quickly, which is why Russia said they made it to begin with, and NATO said, oh, it was never going to happen.
[00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:11.289]  FYI, the NATO paramilitary assembly is a consulate advisory body of NATO. Simply put, They can accept whatever they want, but it will be in the nature of recommendations or such.
[00:44:11.429 --> 00:44:14.110]  Anyone who will rely on those cannot oblige to do anything.
[00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.329]  Let's hope that's the case, but everything they've been advising keeps happening.
[00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:25.989]  Russia to the West sending nukes to Ukraine will be the start of World War III. Following reports, well they said it'd be the start of World War III if they fired missiles at them, they did.
[00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:40.559]  Following reports that Biden is considering deploying nuclear missiles to Ukraine, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council warned transferring nuclear weapons to Kiev would be Preparation for a nuclear conflict with Russia.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:42.179]  No kidding.
[00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:46.320]  The Kremlin put out a statement today.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:54.039]  The majority will suffer the consequences of the reckless few who have no understanding of reality or sense of responsibility.
[00:44:54.039 --> 00:44:54.639]  The Kremlin.
[00:44:56.679 --> 00:45:00.400]  Then we've got other reports out of NATO. Don't be afraid of nuclear war.
[00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:05.360]  I've been hearing that from the Hollywood folks too that don't know anything about anything.
[00:45:06.289 --> 00:45:09.369]  Why the West should not be afraid of Russia's nuclear threats.
[00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:18.590]  Proposal to give Kiev nuclear weapons highly extremist, says the Kremlin.
[00:45:20.269 --> 00:45:24.130]  Nuclear response, senior Russian security officials, Dmitry Mediev.
[00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:32.750]  If the West has supplied nuclear weapons to Ukraine, then Moscow considers its transfer to be tantamount to an attack on Russia, providing grounds for nuclear response.
[00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.230]  Kremlin slams nuclear weapons talk for Ukraine.
[00:45:39.489 --> 00:45:53.309]  Those are absolutely irresponsible arrangements and arguments of people who have a poor understanding of reality and do not feel a shred of responsibility when making such statements.
[00:45:53.789 --> 00:46:00.030]  The report proposed Biden could return nukes removed after the Soviet Union's collapse to deter Russia.
[00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:03.090]  Moscow warned this could justify a nuclear response.
[00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.869]  Britain and France discuss sending troops to Ukraine.
[00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:19.210]  Say that if Trump ends the war, they will attack Russia and drag the United States, just like World War I and World War II, into a new global war.
[00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.969]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:24.190]  That's BBC, The Hill, all of it.
[00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:32.429]  Britain and France not ruling out deploying troops against Russia amid concerns Trump could withdraw U.S. military aid.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.960]  And it goes on and on.
[00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:41.659]  Russia expels diplomat over espionage claims.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.000]  There's video of it happening today.
[00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:56.579]  So there's a lot more here.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.880]  I want to get the phone system fired up and take calls on this subject that I'll intersperse with other news.
[00:47:10.019 --> 00:47:16.619]  So I'll come back from breaks, get a story or two, take some calls, go to break, get a story or two, take calls.
[00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:18.000]  I've got to get to all this as well.
[00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:26.639]  And it all ties into the globalists that are at total war with society, civilization, God, the family, humanity, all life on Earth, all carbon-based life forms.
[00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:30.900]  I mean, it's just a totally alien, fallen entity here trying to get us all to kill each other.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:31.940]  It's exactly what the Bible says.
[00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:39.079]  Yeah, about 2,000 years ago, predicted world government, cashless society, all this stuff.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.440]  Men will become women, women become men.
[00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:42.380]  I mean, it's all...
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.900]  God gave us free will, but he also gave us an instruction manual called a cheat sheet, whatever.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.699]  Yeah, I'm giving you free will because I love you so much and want to experience eternity with you, but...
[00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:59.840]  In case you really don't understand or don't see how obvious this is, here, here's a little cheat sheet.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:14.440]  Yeah, you got to take this test, and it's going to determine where your spirit energetically goes for all eternity, but I'm going to really give you a warning here, just so it's absolutely clear.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:21.559]  So, we'll get the number out here in a moment.
[00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:25.829]  Is Harmon in there ready to take the calls?
[00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:28.750]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[00:48:29.989 --> 00:48:37.570]  And we will talk about this and what you think is coming next and how you think we stop it and I'm going to get into that first when we come back.
[00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:50.170]  But I cannot stress enough to everyone that when you get focused and you have a sense of urgency and engagement, the world changes.
[00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:52.630]  There's a lot more good people than there are bad people.
[00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:57.079]  And they come in every shape and size and color.
[00:48:58.059 --> 00:48:59.380]  Some are male, some are female.
[00:48:59.579 --> 00:49:14.800]  But we have to get the general public away, but we also have to use our energy to motivate and to back people in the system, in government and corporations and academia and the world, to have courage and to stand up now and to make this the issue,
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.880]  not who's going to be playing in the NFL Thursday while we stuff our faces with pecan pie.
[00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.369]  Because we've gotten in trouble because we let psychotics run things and get in control.
[00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.769]  We have to get informed.
[00:49:27.929 --> 00:49:28.690]  We have to get engaged.
[00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:45.559]  So when you take the live feeds from Real Alex Jones on X or at Infowars on X or at AJN Live on X and share them on your email, your text message, everywhere, It's an X link, so it gets through the Google sensors that are on your email,
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.159]  you know, Gmail's censored and everything else, and you take the clips and post them on Facebook or anywhere.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.380]  Even if they get taken down later, they'll get a couple million views a lot of times before that happens.
[00:49:55.039 --> 00:49:56.400]  All of that moves the ball.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:05.440]  So, what we're covering is central, is dead-on, is important, but it's like a tree falling in the forest if nobody's there to hear it make a sound.
[00:50:05.539 --> 00:50:06.219]  Did it make a sound?
[00:50:07.679 --> 00:50:13.460]  So, We're doing important things here, but you are just as important as I am or more.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.579]  Like Matt Drudge would say 25 years ago, we are the media now.
[00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:19.119]  Elon Musk says that now.
[00:50:19.239 --> 00:50:19.579]  It's true.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.300]  More so than ever.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.719]  We are the resistance.
[00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:25.780]  We are engaging.
[00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:27.579]  So...
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.820]  Hit your email list.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.900]  Hit your text message list.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.559]  Tell people about it.
[00:50:33.699 --> 00:50:39.639]  And tell those you tell about the show to tell them to say, hey, Alex Jones is on air really covering the insane escalations of the total war.
[00:50:40.159 --> 00:50:44.980]  NATO's already got us in a war without having a big debate about it.
[00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:45.860]  It's super unpopular.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:46.380]  It's wrong.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:46.860]  It's illegal.
[00:50:47.059 --> 00:50:48.719]  But it's already out of control.
[00:50:48.719 --> 00:50:51.019]  They're getting ready for national drafts all over the Western world.
[00:50:52.579 --> 00:50:56.800]  The Pentagon came out and said we're ready for full commitment for Article 5 to go to full war with Russia.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.800]  As NATO says, fine, we're going to attack Russia.
[00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:00.980]  And then if they attack back, you're going to come in.
[00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:02.780]  I mean, this is illegal by the rules of war.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.300]  This is war crime stuff here.
[00:51:05.239 --> 00:51:06.960]  Just to talk about it and propose it.
[00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:12.500]  So this is so hellish and so destructive and so insane.
[00:51:12.739 --> 00:51:14.480]  It should be easy to beat this.
[00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:18.400]  But you've got to get mobilized against it.
[00:51:18.539 --> 00:51:20.699]  So, share the live feed.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.639]  Later, when clips of the show are archived to X and band-out video, go to real-all shows.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.280]  Share them.
[00:51:26.699 --> 00:51:30.019]  Yeah, we're reaching, you know, 60, 70 million people a day on X alone.
[00:51:30.159 --> 00:51:30.619]  That's great.
[00:51:31.539 --> 00:51:33.019]  But we want to reach 200 billion.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.340]  I mean, we're right there.
[00:51:34.519 --> 00:51:35.199]  A billion.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.679]  I want to get that up to Elon Musk numbers, and I want to see him go up even higher.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.340]  I don't want him to reach a billion people.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.280]  I want him to reach 5 billion people.
[00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:47.150]  I want to see him reach 8.5 billion people a day.
[00:51:47.909 --> 00:51:48.210]  Okay?
[00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:49.809]  I want to see Tucker Carlson do that.
[00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:50.809]  I want to see you do that.
[00:51:52.269 --> 00:51:54.010]  Get in the information warfare game.
[00:51:55.429 --> 00:51:56.610]  And yeah, we had a big victory.
[00:51:56.769 --> 00:51:58.329]  The judge is like, ooh, this looks bad.
[00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.670]  Full investigation hearings said it may take more than just two more hearings.
[00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.469]  He wants it all investigated.
[00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.829]  He wants it all out what they did.
[00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:05.769]  And they've been caught red-handed.
[00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:06.550]  We have all the documents.
[00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:07.789]  So we're still on air.
[00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.369]  So, whether Infowars stays on air or not, you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.989]  It's not owned by Infowars, but it's the sponsor.
[00:52:18.809 --> 00:52:20.650]  And it's funding Infowars.

[00:52:50.719 --> 00:52:52.300]  And then it funds this operation.

[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.130]  It's not just the concentrated Irish Seamoss, it's the bladder rack.
[00:53:32.269 --> 00:53:37.190]  The burdock root and the concentrated pepperdine, it would take an hour to go over all the stuff it does.
[00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:38.510]  But you see my skin.
[00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.550]  You see my energy.
[00:53:39.989 --> 00:53:41.869]  You see how much younger I look.
[00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:48.989]  And I'm taking it religiously the last three months, even before they officially had it in the last two months.
[00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.010]  I had the test bottles.
[00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.489]  I said, you're not taking our CMOS? This stuff's strong.
[00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:59.250]  Equivalent of 40 grams per serving and just two capsules of concentrate of these products.
[00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.230]  Just the CMOS alone.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:09.059]  You have to eat a lot of, you have to eat a big old pile, a huge salad, a huge salad of Irish CMOS to get this in two capsules.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.960]  It is incredible.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.719]  Where has it been my whole life?
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.940]  You want Ultimate CMOS at theallocshownstore.com, Patriot gear, Trump gear, InfoWars gear, it's all there and it keeps us on the air.

[00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.210]  Your calls, tons of news and more.
[00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:33.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[00:54:33.369 --> 00:54:34.650]  He's only president-elect right now.
[00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:36.550]  We are exposing the globalists.
[00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:39.570]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.449]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:43.829]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.309]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:52.170]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:57.630]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[00:54:57.849 --> 00:55:06.309]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:09.690]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:17.869]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.

[00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:33.510]  I've lost so much weight.
[00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:34.469]  It's insane.
[00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.590]  Get that and other supplements.
[00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:36.050]  And then...
[00:55:36.619 --> 00:55:40.280]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:46.780]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.739]  They had the best designs.
[00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:49.860]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.340]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[00:55:52.679 --> 00:55:54.000]  These designs are incredible.
[00:55:54.179 --> 00:56:00.420]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:01.159]  Here they are.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.119]  Look at this one.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.179]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.199]  We are all Alex Jones.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.380]  You've got to get that.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.699]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.639]  Oh my goodness.
[00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:16.260]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:19.639]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[00:56:20.119 --> 00:56:21.260]  Team Humanity.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.960]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[00:56:23.059 --> 00:56:25.280]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.219]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:32.849]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[00:56:33.269 --> 00:56:34.190]  Darkest Hour.
[00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:35.650]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[00:56:35.909 --> 00:56:40.750]  And so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:40.869 --> 00:56:42.909]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[00:56:43.469 --> 00:56:48.289]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[00:56:48.429 --> 00:57:00.909]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:04.710]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:08.630]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:11.050]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.469]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.789]  We get part of it to operate.
[00:57:14.469 --> 00:57:17.010]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.989]  And they spread the word.
[00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:18.750]  You meet like-minded people.
[00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:25.130]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.389]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[00:57:28.769 --> 00:57:39.409]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:42.010]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:52.309]  If you really want to support us and hang on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[00:57:52.449 --> 00:57:54.269]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[00:57:54.489 --> 00:57:55.750]  You're going to want to order again.
[00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.190]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[00:57:58.559 --> 00:57:59.599]  I'm suing the deep state.
[00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:00.559]  We're going after them.
[00:58:00.659 --> 00:58:06.679]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.139]  We're going to win this thing.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.900]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:21.500]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.480]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:35.260]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack.
[00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:55.679]  So essentially what this public-private partnership at the WEF is pushing for is for every person's access to the internet to be tied to a digital ID or a government-issued ID, but presumably a digital ID just because of where government-issued ID programs are all going essentially around the world.
[00:58:56.039 --> 00:59:03.579]  People aren't necessarily going to consent to that unless they are made to believe that anonymity and privacy online are dangerous.
[00:59:04.159 --> 00:59:08.900]  So how exactly can you convince people that that needs to happen?
[00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:24.119]  Well, you have some sort of Event where anonymous hackers do something online that causes major disruption globally, and then the consent can be manufactured through fear and panic, as is often done.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:34.079]  That anonymity and privacy needs to be eliminated, that we need to know exactly who is doing what online to prevent a calamity of that scale from ever happening again.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.440]  And this is the exact solution that these guys have been cooking for a very long time.
[00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:52.030]  Hackers affiliated with China's People's Liberation Army have infiltrated critical services here in the U.S. It was actually a very shocking result to us that there's very few number of substations you need to take out in the entire United States to knock out the entire grid.
[00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:53.510]  Knock out the entire grid?
[00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.909]  That's correct.
[00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.550]  How many would it take to knock out putting the entire country in a blackout?
[00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:00.610]  Less than 20. That report was from 2013 and it actually found the number was even lower.
[01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:01.110]  Nine.
[01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:04.409]  Taking out just nine critical substations could black out the whole country.
[01:00:04.599 --> 01:00:12.960]  This was a huge cyber attack in the panicked early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, targeting a $1.8 trillion government agency.
[01:00:13.239 --> 01:00:15.420]  The truth of it has never been reported.
[01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:21.699]  This is the Department of Health and Human Services, and on March 16, 2020, they were going to full remote work.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:33.480]  Network operators had to adjust all their firewall and security settings to allow hundreds of thousands of new unknown connections into their network, so they had to scale down their security all at the same time.
[01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.610]  And that's when the attacks drop.
[01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:38.489]  China's preparing for war with the United States.
[01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:42.289]  The strategy here is that they want to be able to invade Taiwan.
[01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:49.469]  They're worried that the United States will project military power from bases in Hawaii and the continental United States to Asia.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.800]  To defend Taiwan.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:04.780]  And so what China's trying to do is to do these cyber intrusions, lay in wait, and at the right moment, attack ports, attack water supply, attack energy supplies to prevent the United States from projecting military power forward.
[01:01:05.159 --> 01:01:11.300]  CCP, Tide Group, is quietly fueling US-based climate initiatives, tax violence.
[01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:12.750]  And it goes through.
[01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:23.170]  The group's wanting to shut off fossil fuels, shut down the coal plants, CCP funded, Saudi Arabian funded, and they have their buddies in our government that are heavily invested there as the middlemen.
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.590]  They're shipping what's left of our jobs overseas.
[01:01:26.869 --> 01:01:28.170]  They're making announcements all over the country.
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:31.170]  No more money for building traditional roads.
[01:01:31.289 --> 01:01:34.349]  They're building roads just for EVs in Florida.
[01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.710]  The road itself will charge electric vehicles.
[01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:43.429]  If you have an electric vehicle and you have the right equipment attached, you will be able to charge as you're driving.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.579]  That dynamic charging is a pilot program.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.420]  So at first, it'll only work for the fleet of test electric vehicles.
[01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:54.639]  But the end goal is for the expressway to charge all types of EVs.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.719]  And I think when this is done, this will be a leadership model for the rest of the world.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.500]  And they're putting power cables under the road, but don't worry, they said it's coming to a road near you.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.500]  And they're going to do it on regular roads so you don't have to pull over and charge.
[01:02:08.699 --> 01:02:16.099]  You just drive down the highway while all that radiation, same stuff comes out of power lines that makes people sick on record.
[01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:19.860]  And then you've got Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
[01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:34.599]  And all these people, Republican and Democrat leaders, who are warmongers, the neocons, whose families run the damn companies, the media, the energy, the transportation, the shipyards, everything.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.340]  The looting is incredible.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:44.619]  And again, they're inflating the currency, but they buy up real stuff as it's inflated, then they pass us the debt and the devaluation.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.800]  I mean, wow, that is a whopper.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.119]  This is an extremely, extremely dangerous situation that we are in right now.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:03.119]  The good news is, all over the world, people are identifying the globalist plan to collapse the economy by design in their own statements.
[01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:09.409]  What can we do together to avert a global food catastrophe?
[01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:21.190]  To start, we have to understand the forces that have led us to this current precipice, the most existential of which is climate change.
[01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:26.269]  And the fact that they have put their politicians and controllers in, in every major government.
[01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:33.250]  We are now live in our number two of this Tuesday, November 26, 2024 transmission.
[01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.289]  Powered by the people.
[01:03:37.989 --> 01:03:45.210]  Powered by your will to be free and prosper and crush the tyrants.
[01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.590]  We didn't ask for this fight.
[01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.210]  We didn't start this fight.
[01:03:50.429 --> 01:03:53.110]  But we are under attack today.
[01:03:53.369 --> 01:03:56.610]  And we accept the challenge.
[01:03:57.329 --> 01:03:59.929]  We don't roll over and die.
[01:04:01.869 --> 01:04:03.349]  We take action.
[01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:08.409]  All right.
[01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:24.820]  I'm going to give the toll-free number out on this Live Tuesday transmission to take your calls on the fact that we're in World War III. NATO has decided to go to full war with Russia, beyond proxy war, and that's how wars accelerate into world war and total war,
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.360]  and nuclear war, is two sides use a country to fight.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.260]  That's the most common way empires get into this, historically.
[01:04:32.719 --> 01:04:41.300]  And then one empire or one group starts winning, and the other group starts doubling down, and the other group doubles down, and then finally they go with their full forces.
[01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:53.449]  That's why Biden said two years ago, we could give him Abrams tanks and F-16s, but that escalates to World War III. And that's what all his advisors told him.
[01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:57.130]  And then in the last few months, they've decided, well, let's just start bombing with missiles.
[01:04:57.469 --> 01:05:01.849]  Hell, and then it's like the dam of sanity collapses.
[01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:02.949]  Well, let's just give them nukes.
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.170]  Well, hell, let's just get troops ready.
[01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:05.489]  Let's just go to full war.
[01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.570]  Hell, let's just sneak attack and strike them first.
[01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:11.050]  The Pentagon's like, yeah, attack them first and we'll back you.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.920]  We stand ready.
[01:05:13.179 --> 01:05:14.119]  Rock solid.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.139]  Those are quotes.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.559]  Stand back and stand ready.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:27.360]  So, how do we stop these people?
[01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:31.159]  Trump has not come out.
[01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:45.429]  Since he was elected president, that video I aired last Tuesday when the missile strikes began by the United States with the attack on Russia, I played, and it got 140-something million views on my X account.
[01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:48.909]  We put out three versions of it with comments around it, three different reports.
[01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:58.550]  Last time I checked, it had over 40, 44, over 45, 40. That was like 130 million last time I checked.
[01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.510]  So, other people, it was everywhere.
[01:06:04.759 --> 01:06:06.519]  But everybody else said it was new.
[01:06:07.019 --> 01:06:09.219]  No, it's on True Social from over a year ago.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.780]  He says this is going to escalate.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.559]  Don't give a missile.
[01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:15.380]  It's going to lead to World War III because they were proposing it back then, too.
[01:06:15.519 --> 01:06:16.260]  Now they've just done it.
[01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:23.559]  So as General Flynn, respectfully, kept saying to Trump yesterday about five times that I remember.
[01:06:24.519 --> 01:06:26.679]  In fact, let's take yesterday's interview with Flynn.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.840]  Guys, go through that and just get the parts where he has a message to Trump.
[01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:53.550]  And boil it down to like six, seven, eight minutes and say General Flynn issues emergency message to Trump, calls for the 47th president to call for global peace ahead of Thanksgiving and stop nuclear war before it's too late.
[01:06:53.989 --> 01:07:10.110]  I mean, that's what Flynn said, kind of epic, a little bit important, like the most important thing said, In the last few weeks, in the realm of peace, was said by the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[01:07:10.289 --> 01:07:26.389]  the head of all military intelligence, that is 80% of the intelligence, the most powerful position in reality in the intelligence agencies, former head of it, one of the most respected directors ever, former National Security Advisor to the President,
[01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:29.949]  telling you we've never been in more danger.
[01:07:32.019 --> 01:07:32.860]  Of nuclear war.
[01:07:33.099 --> 01:07:33.639]  Never.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.960]  Never.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:45.340]  And that's what the International Atomic Energy Association of Scientists have said as well with their doomsday clock.
[01:07:47.179 --> 01:07:55.880]  That's what Dr. Francis Boyle, top UN weapons expert said last week.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:03.570]  So just in case you're a new viewer and you have a normalcy bias, Or you're a liberal that thinks X and Y chromosomes don't exist.
[01:08:03.849 --> 01:08:05.309]  Let me explain to you very slowly.
[01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.510]  We're already in World War III, sweetheart.
[01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:09.550]  Cutie pie.
[01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.750]  Cupcake.
[01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:12.110]  Okay?
[01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:24.689]  So, I know people have a normalcy bias that stuff like this doesn't happen.
[01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:36.670]  Governments killed conservatively 300 million people in the 20th century.
[01:08:40.489 --> 01:08:57.350]  So, in a country with running water and electricity and cheap food and medicine and transportation and all these ballgames, people are like, that is the equivalent of a pig being fattened up Over the fall to be butchered to be a Christmas ham.
[01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:03.529]  And the pigs in there winking and squealing and he's getting all the special leftovers at dinner.
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:11.850]  Man, he's getting steak bones and he's getting pieces of pie and, you know, crust of pie and just, you know, salads and just all.
[01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:17.590]  His buddies over there, they're going to be sold later for slaughter to the factory.
[01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:22.789]  To the slaughterhouse, but this special little juicy pig, he's only about a year old.
[01:09:22.949 --> 01:09:24.449]  He's fat, juicy, young.
[01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:27.569]  He is just squealing with delight.
[01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:34.869]  He is getting all the most delicious delectables.
[01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:38.550]  That's what normalcy bias is.
[01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:44.170]  Because all he knew is he woke up, he was born, he was suckling on his mommy with the other piglets.
[01:09:44.979 --> 01:10:15.949]  And now he's a year old oinking and squealing happily in his pen and he's been chosen to have his throat slit on December 15th and then he's going to get chopped up and get put in the smokehouse for a couple weeks and then he's going to get put in the oven and it's going to have different delicious spices put on him like cloves And
[01:10:15.949 --> 01:10:16.569]  brown sugar.
[01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:19.170]  And then he's going to get eaten.
[01:10:21.109 --> 01:10:28.710]  So when you look at the general public having no idea, blissfully unaware of what's going on, you're a pig in a slaughter stall.
[01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:35.229]  And your ignorance is very dangerous.
[01:10:36.789 --> 01:10:38.449]  They say ignorance is bliss.
[01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:39.649]  No, it equals death.
[01:10:41.729 --> 01:10:49.329]  So I don't want to be the Christmas pig in Satan's thermonuclear hell storm.
[01:10:51.369 --> 01:11:01.010]  And I don't have a normalcy bias because I can turn it off and be focused on history and facts and cold-bloodedly face it.
[01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:21.630]  Then I can energetically use my cold-blooded analysis To have energy to fight, but the emotions are like nitrous oxide in a race car that I add to the fuel to take my horsepower up even more.
[01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:25.670]  But the emotions do not control me.
[01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:32.899]  That's why threats and attacks and demonization Does it work?
[01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:45.140]  Because I understand that, like in Dune, I've got to put my hand in the box, the pain induction box, because that isn't real pain.
[01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:51.380]  The real pain will be death if I remove my hand from the box.
[01:11:54.939 --> 01:12:02.880]  And so the globalists apply pain, apply pressure, apply criticism, and they laugh at people if they don't join the cult.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:12.260]  So we see the weakest of our people, and they are our people, fellow humans, fall to the mind virus because they run from the threat.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:19.420]  Just like you can put a hot probe in a Petri dish with amoebas, and they feel the heat, and they run from it.
[01:12:22.779 --> 01:12:25.840]  And as a basic instinct, that's okay at one level.
[01:12:25.859 --> 01:12:28.859]  But not when you're facing a sophisticated system like this.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.659]  You have to go towards the flame.
[01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:34.300]  You have to go towards the flack.
[01:12:34.399 --> 01:12:36.119]  You have to go towards the pain.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.420]  And then the pain becomes victory.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.220]  So, let's not deny where we are.
[01:12:46.359 --> 01:12:48.119]  Here is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:12:50.119 --> 01:12:51.260]  What do you think we should do?
[01:12:51.359 --> 01:12:52.560]  What do you think is coming next?
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.840]  What do you think of these developments?
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.039]  What would you like to see Trump do?
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.340]  And I keep saying, what are the solutions?
[01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:14.220]  I'm not going to second-guess Trump, but when I talked to Flynn two weeks ago, and a week ago, and a few days ago, on air, on the phone, he was obviously concerned, and he does talk to Trump, and doesn't want to get into the stuff going on there,
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:18.300]  and Trump is in behind-the-scenes diplomacy, so that's good, and that's now admitted the news.
[01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:19.520]  We broke that, of course.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:28.279]  But Trump's looking for some big breakthrough or announcement that he can go forward with saying, I've got a ceasefire proposal by Putin.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.600]  Zelensky's not going to do that.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.159]  He's a total puppet, a dictator.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.939]  And I don't think you're going to get that because the Russians would see that as weak.
[01:13:36.619 --> 01:13:48.600]  You got Putin's response, a ballistic missile test that was successful, targeting and evading anti-missile defense systems and demonstrating the delivery of multiple guided reentry devices.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.939]  Onto Ukrainian targets with precision.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:14:00.720]  And you've got NATO's beyond reckless.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.399]  I don't even...
[01:14:03.399 --> 01:14:11.760]  You know, I don't see this as bluffing by NATO. Even though NATO and its countries and us will be destroyed.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:19.779]  You look at the wild-eyed, gremlin-ish looks on the head of NATO's face.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:37.479]  When you watch not just the actions and the statements, but also the gremlin-like features, the glistening sparkly eyes, the demon smiles.
[01:14:37.939 --> 01:14:39.340]  They can't even hide.
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.279]  They do little gremlin dances.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:48.840]  If you show a shot of me, I'll show you what rut, root, and...
[01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:53.939]  Stoltenberg and just...
[01:14:53.939 --> 01:14:55.439]  Bauer.
[01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.680]  When you look at them on TV, they're like...
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:05.319]  And you're like, ooh, boy, we got a little demon going on there.
[01:15:05.619 --> 01:15:07.420]  Got a little devil stuff happening right there.
[01:15:07.899 --> 01:15:09.420]  So these are demons running around.
[01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:11.300]  It's like you see Kamala.
[01:15:11.399 --> 01:15:12.039]  She couldn't hide it.
[01:15:12.119 --> 01:15:12.819]  Biden can't hide it.
[01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:13.920]  I mean, these are Hillary.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.340]  Hello!
[01:15:15.739 --> 01:15:15.739]  Hello!
[01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:19.020]  I mean, you're dealing with some really bad people.
[01:15:19.239 --> 01:15:20.500]  Because they ain't people.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800]  Ain't nobody home that's human there.
[01:15:23.159 --> 01:15:24.279]  That's an avatar.
[01:15:24.279 --> 01:15:26.880]  That's been turned over to the bad guys.
[01:15:28.579 --> 01:15:42.399]  And so we got open demons in human bodies that are just doing everything they can to sleepwalk us into the end of the world.
[01:15:44.979 --> 01:15:47.979]  And so, pray, that's most important.
[01:15:49.939 --> 01:15:56.300]  Trump needs to come out and call for global peace and call for unilateral ceasefires today.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.520]  Dominate the news cycle tomorrow.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.800]  Believe me, NATO, the global is sitting around going, why hasn't Trump gone public?
[01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.180]  Why isn't he fighting us?
[01:16:08.359 --> 01:16:13.319]  And they're like, we'll hit them with missiles and say you're going to sneak attack them with nukes and say the military is ready to invade.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:21.119]  And I mean, those are provocations of the greatest order other than launching the nuclear sneak attack itself.
[01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:24.859]  I mean, they don't have much more escalation room.
[01:16:25.489 --> 01:16:30.229]  In fact, that's the biggest takeaway here is NATO has escalated the world.
[01:16:30.369 --> 01:16:32.890]  The globalists have escalated the world.
[01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:38.810]  The globalists have taken humanity to the very precipice of total thermonuclear war.
[01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:40.850]  We are on the edge.
[01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:43.949]  And there's no more room.
[01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:47.310]  In fact, it's already insanely reckless.
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:17:00.159]  It's already elicited the Russians getting ready for nuclear war and saying so, and successfully testing a hypersonic ballistic nuclear weapon delivery system that can't be stopped.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.560]  And this is fabulously dangerous.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.460]  Gargantuanly dangerous.
[01:17:13.659 --> 01:17:20.819]  Look, with the minions and some of the public and the functionaries, it is normalcy bias and delusion.
[01:17:22.119 --> 01:17:32.520]  But if you look at the body language of Austin and Kirby and the rest of them and Blinken, they look scared.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:42.500]  Because they're spiritually being pushed to do this, and they know it's prison or nuclear war, and they're...
[01:17:47.289 --> 01:18:00.710]  Fully aware of the fact that the globalist satanic spirit directing them was one at war with Russia the whole time and is going in that direction and moving everyone to the edge of it.
[01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:06.550]  And that even if Russia starts bowing down, Russia said, fine, we'll leave Ukraine.
[01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.890]  And we'll, okay, total sanctions.
[01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:10.489]  And now we got to get rid of your government.
[01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:13.590]  And now we're going to try you for war crimes.
[01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:36.630]  So they're going to escalate and cross any red lines Russia has until Russia finally attacks back and it will all be billed that they're war criminals and they think at the end of this nuclear war whoever survives that they're going to go around with some new global government and try everyone that fought back against them including their domestic opposition.
[01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:42.789]  So they get their domestic opposition after the nuclear war with the survivors being killed or put in camps, bare minimum.
[01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:47.289]  And they get to go around the world attacking everybody that didn't go along with it, saying they're Russians.
[01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:50.810]  And after all, the Russians killed 6 billion people in the war.
[01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:53.029]  And then that's their new...
[01:18:56.269 --> 01:19:20.609]  Technocracy, robot, hellscape system where they emerge with the only organizational systems that can recobble together the world and now all their opposition to world government and genetic engineering and human cloning and all this garbage is gone and they'll still have hundreds of millions of people that can torture and manipulate and sacrifice to Satan basically,
[01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:23.130]  culturally, spiritually, physically, literally.
[01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:28.909]  And so to a demon, I mean, this sounds like a really fun place.
[01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:38.729]  A normal person that's not satanically run and possessed and overtaken, it just doesn't even seem real.
[01:19:38.829 --> 01:19:39.289]  You're like, what?
[01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:41.750]  Why would I get an ice cream truck?
[01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:42.789]  This is real.
[01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.149]  That's why it's a cliche.
[01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:49.149]  Why would you get a creeper van and put little, you know, pictures of...
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:20:05.539]  Houses and grass and little kids playing and driving around with, you know, ice cream and, you know, whenever you see the coast is clear, grab a kid out of their backyard and take them to a basement and rape them for a couple days and torture them to death after you inject, you know, pool cleaning acid in their head.
[01:20:06.859 --> 01:20:08.840]  I mean, he's like, what?
[01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:16.680]  Well, but that's because you're not a demon.
[01:20:19.329 --> 01:20:21.729]  You know, you don't want to torture puppy dogs and kittens.
[01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:23.029]  Well, that's because you're not satanic.
[01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:25.050]  But there are plenty of people that do.
[01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:33.770]  And the dumber ones just, you know, run around like Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy, Tim Budd, all of them.
[01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:39.550]  The smart ones are ahead of NATO. And NATO's all been caught.
[01:20:39.689 --> 01:20:43.189]  They're the biggest child trafficking group in the world until Mayorkas came along.
[01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:46.930]  And they have this huge, long, disgusting history.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.899]  Of the NATO chiefs and the top judges, you know, being pedophiles and Satanists.
[01:20:53.039 --> 01:20:54.279]  I mean, if you don't know about it, look it up.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.899]  It's even mainstream news.
[01:20:56.659 --> 01:21:00.840]  But they just bury it at the back of the paper.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.159]  And you just got to come to grips with the fact the devil's real.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.319]  God's real, the devil's real.
[01:21:06.899 --> 01:21:10.840]  Satan's greatest trick was, everybody knows the answer, convincing the world he didn't exist.
[01:21:11.479 --> 01:21:21.029]  So here's the toll-free number, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEKS. 877-789-2539.
[01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:29.989]  And again, if you're watching or listening to us on local radio, please support the station, support their sponsors, tell folks about the local station, local cable, local TV, do the same.
[01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.989]  They are so important.
[01:21:31.109 --> 01:21:31.789]  They're such great people.
[01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.829]  Become a sponsor.
[01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:37.010]  And if you're watching on Exit World Alex Jones, repost.
[01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:38.630]  Share the live feed.
[01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:40.970]  Say, hey, this is really important, what's being covered right now.
[01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:43.130]  I think folks should watch this and share this.
[01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:46.750]  We've got to stop World War III and hit your email list, hit your text message.
[01:21:46.949 --> 01:21:49.970]  You know, I just did that 30 minutes ago because it's everything.
[01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:53.470]  I should rant for an hour about how important you are.
[01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:55.310]  Drill it into the brain.
[01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:58.569]  And I know most of you understand that.
[01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:00.550]  But it's like throwing a punch.
[01:22:00.729 --> 01:22:02.609]  We're really throwing hard punches at the globalists.
[01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:09.090]  But when you guys get really energized, we won't reach 60 million people on X today.
[01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.810]  Let's reach 150 today.
[01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:13.369]  Let's do it.
[01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:17.510]  You take clips out of the show that you think are most important.
[01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:18.210]  You share them.
[01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:23.670]  877-789-2539.
[01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:29.590]  On the subject of the world war we're in, how bad it's gotten, how we reverse it.
[01:22:30.869 --> 01:22:31.689]  It's important.
[01:22:33.489 --> 01:22:48.670]  Now I'm going to come back and hit big sections on the censorship control, the globalists, their counteroffensive for total surveillance and censorship.
[01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:52.609]  Their response to collapse, already collapsed.
[01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:56.210]  They just now are admitting the collapse of their propaganda systems.
[01:22:57.329 --> 01:22:59.149]  Some very interesting clips and articles there.
[01:22:59.869 --> 01:23:12.109]  I'm then going to shift gears into the latest Project Veritas, where they've caught one of the heads of a federal agency admitting, of course, COVID shots don't work.
[01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.869]  Of course it hurts you.
[01:23:12.949 --> 01:23:14.189]  We make a lot of money out of it.
[01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:19.350]  Now, we already already know that, but they know it's showing it's all premeditated, which we already knew, but there's the confession.
[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:24.210]  And the Senate criminal investigations that are going on.
[01:23:26.829 --> 01:23:28.090]  That's just three stacks.
[01:23:28.649 --> 01:23:30.189]  Every other stack, this is insane.
[01:23:30.409 --> 01:23:34.810]  But I'll hit those quickly, go to your calls, and then I'm going to do the fourth hour as well.
[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:39.609]  So we'll get to all of this and a lot of your calls here today.
[01:23:39.609 --> 01:23:45.729]  So we'll be covering the military escalation that's central to everything, and then some of the other stuff they're planning.
[01:23:46.409 --> 01:24:02.439]  They'll definitely admit that the deep state's Leading white supremacist groups, creating white supremacist groups, so that this myth that the white supremacists are going to blow the power grid up, when the globalists are ready to cut the power,
[01:24:02.659 --> 01:24:06.300]  they're going to do that, and then they'll have some white supremacist patsies.
[01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:19.739]  So if you are a young incel white supremacist, average age 20 years old, and you've been recruited by these groups online, you go to the meetings, do your little Nordic rituals and stuff, those are all FBI agents or CIA intelligence agents or German intelligence agents.
[01:24:19.899 --> 01:24:20.579]  A lot of them are German.
[01:24:21.369 --> 01:24:22.630]  They work for the German intelligence.
[01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:24.729]  They'll do something illegal through the Germans back here.
[01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:29.750]  They've done it big time in Germany, creating the white supremacy groups to then control everything.
[01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:37.770]  They're also gearing up big time to take out the power and blame it on Trump supporters who they'll say are white supremacists.
[01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:40.289]  So we got news on that and a lot more.
[01:24:40.449 --> 01:24:44.609]  So I'm going to tell all the little white supremacists, you're being led by federal agents.
[01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:46.010]  You are idiots.
[01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:47.930]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:48.739 --> 01:24:56.079]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:24:56.079 --> 01:24:57.199]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:24:57.539 --> 01:25:02.619]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there just being in this studio.
[01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:03.840]  I never imagined I'd be here.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.760]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.460]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:25:05.539 --> 01:25:06.340]  I can't wait.
[01:25:06.859 --> 01:25:09.000]  To learn who the next winner is.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.600]  And even though they shut out InfoWars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.779]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me.
[01:25:13.899 --> 01:25:17.939]  So we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[01:25:18.119 --> 01:25:18.699]  We already knew that.
[01:25:18.819 --> 01:25:20.060]  But now they've bragged about it.
[01:25:20.159 --> 01:25:25.260]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on at the Alex Jones Network.
[01:25:25.479 --> 01:25:28.060]  And so this baby is the new promotion.
[01:25:28.439 --> 01:25:29.420]  And I will be...
[01:25:29.789 --> 01:25:37.689]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you, from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alk Shows Network family.
[01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:39.310]  You are our family.
[01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:40.750]  God bless you all.
[01:25:40.909 --> 01:25:43.989]  Now go to thealkshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:45.850]  Please stand by for further details.
[01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:48.210]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.930]  All right.
[01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:52.949]  Your calls are coming up, but I want to look at the organized attacks by...
[01:25:53.810 --> 01:26:01.050]  NATO, the UN, the G20, the Democratic Party, governments like Brazil, Australia, to ban speech.
[01:26:01.329 --> 01:26:02.390]  Big developments.
[01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:10.649]  Infowars.com article, G20's online speech clampdown set to ignite free speech fears.
[01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:19.329]  I mean, it is hardcore what is going on and so much more than all these articles.
[01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:22.289]  Elections are bad for democracy.
[01:26:22.569 --> 01:26:24.149]  New York Times, not a joke.
[01:26:24.529 --> 01:26:26.350]  The First Amendment is out of control.
[01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:33.510]  Politico, the Constitution is sacred.
[01:26:33.989 --> 01:26:35.390]  Is it also dangerous?
[01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:41.989]  I mean, this is just open tyranny.
[01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:51.850]  And now new major university studies out that were suppressed that DEI is meant to create racism and division.
[01:26:51.989 --> 01:26:52.810]  Yeah, it's divide and conquer.
[01:26:53.710 --> 01:27:09.109]  So, no matter what side you're on, and I see it's manipulation of someone on either side, with the whole Palestinian-Israel thing that's being manipulated for global conflict, just like Ukraine, all over England, all over the UK,
[01:27:09.329 --> 01:27:19.010]  all over Europe, all over Canada, all over Australia, it's the same everywhere, it's globalist, If you try to peacefully have a pro-Israel march, you get arrested, you get attacked.
[01:27:19.770 --> 01:27:35.210]  And if you go out and show the Islamists calling for death to the West and all the rest of it, as Ezra Levant did with his great free speech, global outlet that does so much wonderful work, you get arrested.
[01:27:35.409 --> 01:27:42.670]  If you go show a man, a 60-year-old man, in girls' swimming and in girls' locker rooms, they come after you.
[01:27:43.529 --> 01:27:45.090]  Well, he got arrested yesterday.
[01:27:45.289 --> 01:27:51.890]  Toronto police vetoes our charter rights in favor of pro-Hamas thugs.
[01:27:52.649 --> 01:27:55.890]  So Levant was just there videotaping it, but he's known.
[01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:58.350]  And so, well, he was arrested.
[01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:05.270]  But they don't ever go after the Islamicists when they engage in violence.
[01:28:07.679 --> 01:28:19.760]  So the system is backing this and then bringing these Islamic hordes in that are allied by the left as part of a larger plan while they supply weapons to both sides.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.659]  This is the divide and conquer strategy.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:37.199]  But Trudeau, who's fabulously unpopular and is openly waging war on free speech, it's like North Korea has moved to north of the United States, He's just intensifying his activities.
[01:28:37.399 --> 01:28:45.659]  Let's roll some footage of Ezra Levant of rebelnews.com Ezra Levant on X and then we'll talk to the man himself.
[01:28:45.819 --> 01:28:46.079]  Here it is.
[01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:47.369]  I already have.
[01:28:47.569 --> 01:28:48.029]  I cost a lot.
[01:28:48.029 --> 01:28:49.270]  You'll be crazy, you're Jewish, though.
[01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:53.729]  So, like I said to you before, we were here last week.
[01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.050]  Right.
[01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:57.869]  You had a designated area to stay in, and you agreed to stay in it.
[01:28:58.170 --> 01:28:58.810]  I did not.
[01:28:58.930 --> 01:28:59.649]  What are you talking about?
[01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:00.470]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:05.109]  Acting Inspector Ford told me they had a media area for you, and you guys stayed in it, and they came back.
[01:29:05.289 --> 01:29:05.449]  We did not.
[01:29:05.449 --> 01:29:05.770]  We did not.
[01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:08.630]  Because it's not up to him to say, well, please, please stand.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.659]  Well, yeah, because you're inciting this crowd, and then it reaches the peace.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.760]  As I said to you, your presence is inciting them, and that's exactly what you're trying to do.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.460]  I'm a Jew alone, because I'm a Jew.
[01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:19.020]  No, because you're trying to incite them.
[01:29:19.039 --> 01:29:20.060]  I haven't tried to incite them.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.579]  I want you to take a picture of the hate crime that you're abiding.
[01:29:22.579 --> 01:29:23.439]  You could have done it on the other side.
[01:29:23.579 --> 01:29:24.560]  You didn't need to walk over here.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560]  No, I wanted you to go out.
[01:29:25.779 --> 01:29:27.659]  Now I'm going to tell you to move over there.
[01:29:28.119 --> 01:29:30.680]  I allowed you to take that video.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.220]  I allowed you to take that video.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.460]  So you're refusing to leave?
[01:29:33.659 --> 01:29:34.640]  I'm refusing to leave.
[01:29:34.779 --> 01:29:35.020]  Why?
[01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:39.390]  Because I'm a Jew, I'm a citizen, and I'm your boss.
[01:29:39.609 --> 01:29:41.689]  And I don't leave if you say Jews are the matter.
[01:29:41.689 --> 01:29:42.289]  Well, you know what?
[01:29:42.409 --> 01:29:46.489]  In the interest of keeping peace here and public safety, you're under arrest for breach of the peace.
[01:29:46.649 --> 01:29:47.029]  Take a minute.
[01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:47.390]  I'm good!
[01:29:52.310 --> 01:30:00.050]  I'm being arrested.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:04.340]  Because I'm standing on the sidewalk in my city.
[01:30:04.739 --> 01:30:13.439]  I'm a Jew who lives in this neighborhood and I'm being arrested because the police say that's the path of least resistance.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:27.100]  And the crowd cheers because they love freedom of speech.
[01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:31.489]  Just like the countries they came from, don't have free speech.
[01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:34.369]  And they put him in the car, and it goes on from there.
[01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:39.310]  Videos up at rebelnews.com and at Ezra Levant on X and at infowars.com.
[01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:42.170]  But look, I'll go further than Ezra Levant.
[01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:49.630]  Hitler started his persecution of Jews and others in 1933, right after he got into power.
[01:30:50.659 --> 01:31:01.760]  And then by 1938, 39, he said, well, we're just going to put Jews in these ghettos and kick them out of where they live and take their businesses because they're inciting and, well, that's just where they're going to be safe.
[01:31:03.439 --> 01:31:07.159]  And then, of course, they later took them out of the ghettos and, you know, where they went after that.
[01:31:08.619 --> 01:31:16.899]  So any group, I know it's fashionable to gang up on Jews around the world today with the media, both on the left and the right.
[01:31:18.739 --> 01:31:20.359]  It's disgusting to any group.
[01:31:23.089 --> 01:31:26.170]  And particularly with Jews in their history.
[01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:43.609]  So those police officers literally have violated the Nuremberg Code by telling Jews in their own neighborhood that they can't exercise their free speech or even videotape these crowds of Islamic,
[01:31:43.789 --> 01:31:45.810]  communist, globalist goons.
[01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:51.270]  And oh, for everyone's safety, you're going to jail.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.479]  This is the exact same thing.
[01:31:55.079 --> 01:32:00.380]  And there's already no-go zones all over the Western world where no one can go if you're not an Islamicist.
[01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:06.279]  And the grooming gangs, thousands of little girls per town being allowed to be raped and enslaved and killed in many cases.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:10.180]  And you go to jail like Tommy Robinson for exposing it.
[01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:19.810]  Oh yeah, he's in jail for a couple years now because he went and exposed court cases years ago that he exposed of grooming where they didn't fix cases against him.
[01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:20.430]  He's a hero.
[01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.649]  So yeah, this is what we're dealing with.
[01:32:24.569 --> 01:32:26.970]  And so Islam is being protected.
[01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:28.229]  The left is coddling it.
[01:32:28.489 --> 01:32:29.989]  It is extremely dangerous.
[01:32:30.449 --> 01:32:42.539]  And this isn't a small step towards Putting conservatives, Christians, Jews, anybody that isn't a leftist in camps, this is a big step.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.319]  And the left everywhere is saying, get rid of our speech.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.859]  And here, get rid of the Constitution.
[01:32:47.439 --> 01:32:49.920]  And Canada is violating its own Constitution.
[01:32:50.079 --> 01:32:51.779]  Ezra Levant, thank you for popping in with us.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.300]  Give us a recap of what happened and what's happened since, and this outrageous behavior.
[01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:58.670]  Alex, great to see you.
[01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.850]  Thanks for having me on the show, and thank you for your kind words.
[01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:09.430]  Look, you and I have probably done ten interviews with each other over the years, and I'm not sure if we've ever even talked about Jewish or Israel stuff, maybe once.
[01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:12.250]  It's not the center of my identity, actually.
[01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:13.010]  I'm a Canadian.
[01:33:13.289 --> 01:33:14.130]  I'm a journalist.
[01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:15.189]  I believe in freedom.
[01:33:15.609 --> 01:33:24.449]  Remember, I reported from Davos at the World Economic Forum, and we talked about how those globalists were gonna come after Trump and Elon Musk, and they almost beat him.
[01:33:24.569 --> 01:33:26.529]  So you and I talk about a hundred things.
[01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:33.350]  And when I went out on the street of my own city, in my own neighborhood, I was there as a journalist and as a Canadian.
[01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:42.359]  But those Hamas protesters said, no, you're a Jew, and your presence here Is causing a disturbance.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.060]  Now, I don't care what these Hamas activists say.
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.300]  Many of them aren't even Canadian citizens.
[01:33:47.399 --> 01:33:48.619]  I don't know what they're doing in our country.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.720]  But for the cops to say, okay, we will now enforce that rule against you.
[01:33:53.859 --> 01:33:55.800]  That's why I said, no, I'm a citizen.
[01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:57.119]  And yeah, I'm a Jew.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:34:06.340]  And I'm not gonna get off the sidewalk because some foreign provocateur, likely under the pay or direction of Iran, is trying to colonize Canada.
[01:34:06.659 --> 01:34:09.020]  So, I mean, I am Jewish.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:15.800]  And the fact that the police used that to enforce the fatwa by these guys is outrageous.
[01:34:16.119 --> 01:34:18.579]  The fact that I was sent to jail was insane.
[01:34:18.699 --> 01:34:21.539]  Now, they didn't, in the end, file charges against me.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.819]  But you see what the police were doing.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.720]  They were taking the path of least resistance.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.720]  Because there was about 20 Hamas activists there, and there was just one of me.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.319]  Ezra, you're being too nice.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.739]  They celebrated you being arrested.
[01:34:32.739 --> 01:34:33.979]  They were allowed their speech.
[01:34:35.619 --> 01:34:36.680]  You're being too nice.
[01:34:36.779 --> 01:34:43.180]  These police officers need to be charged with serious crimes against humanity because this is how it starts.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.399]  This is a big step.
[01:34:44.539 --> 01:34:46.720]  This isn't one small step for mankind.
[01:34:47.239 --> 01:34:49.300]  This is a big step against mankind.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.359]  Well, I'm going to sue them in civil court because they violated my constitutional rights.
[01:34:55.359 --> 01:34:56.680]  You have your Bill of Rights.
[01:34:56.819 --> 01:34:58.500]  We have something called the Charter of Rights.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.939]  Now, our Charter of Rights is not as strong as your First Amendment.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:08.239]  But I'm a citizen on a public sidewalk as a journalist covering something in the public interest.
[01:35:08.359 --> 01:35:14.640]  By the way, what they did is they recreated the final moments of the Hamas terrorist leader, Yahya Senwar.
[01:35:14.739 --> 01:35:18.079]  They had some guy with like the keffiyeh wrapped around his head.
[01:35:18.409 --> 01:35:22.489]  In a chair that was covered in fake blood, like it was a super gross display.
[01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:25.810]  And I say again, this isn't a residential Jewish neighborhood.
[01:35:26.069 --> 01:35:28.510]  There's no Israeli embassy, no companies nearby.
[01:35:28.869 --> 01:35:31.609]  And so these Hamas activists came into the Jewish neighborhood.
[01:35:31.789 --> 01:35:37.850]  It would be like going into a black neighborhood and burning a cross in front of a black church and wearing a hood.
[01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:41.390]  And I mean, maybe freedom of speech permits that.
[01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:44.810]  I'm actually a free speech, as you know, I'm very big on free speech.
[01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:51.460]  But for them, Oh yeah, we would be concerned if they weren't letting these Hamas idiots have their free speech.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.199]  And how disgusting is it that they cheered you?
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.720]  If they're non-citizens, I say get out.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.060]  But non-citizens, I don't think they have the...
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.619]  You're like a guest in our house.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.239]  No, deport them.
[01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:05.569]  But, I mean, it's a tough one, because you know how free speech works, Alex?
[01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:08.590]  It's a gift you gotta give your opponents if you want it for yourself.
[01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:12.829]  And I love free speech for myself, so I have to tolerate hearing things that I don't like.
[01:36:12.949 --> 01:36:24.770]  But these cops believe in hate crimes, and yet they were abiding all manner of hate crimes, but me filming those hate crimes, and again, that's their definition, not mine, they couldn't abide.
[01:36:24.989 --> 01:36:28.810]  And I gotta say, This is the first time I've been arrested.
[01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:31.590]  But you may know my reporter, David Menzies.
[01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:33.369]  He always wears that Panama hat.
[01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:39.250]  He's been arrested five times in 2024. Once at this same location.
[01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:43.430]  Once when he tried to ask a question of our Deputy Prime Minister.
[01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:49.949]  Once when he covered a transgender athlete in a rugby game, smashing the girls.
[01:36:50.529 --> 01:36:54.569]  So in Canada, reporters are arrested every month or so.
[01:36:55.359 --> 01:37:01.020]  But there are only conservative reporters that are arrested, and the rest of the media, the regime media, don't care.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:08.680]  It's totally disgusting, and it's happening everywhere.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.479]  I mean, talk about Tommy Robinson.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:15.140]  Yeah, I mean, Tommy is a former reporter with Rebel News.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:18.319]  He's been on his own for a few years, but he is in prison right now.
[01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:28.210]  I don't know if you know this, Alex, I went to visit him in prison in the UK. And they sent him, because he's at risk, because as you know, in the United States, there's different prison gangs.
[01:37:28.350 --> 01:37:31.689]  There's the black gangs and the Latino gangs and the white gangs, etc.
[01:37:31.829 --> 01:37:36.770]  In the UK, the prisons are almost completely dominated by Islamic gangs.
[01:37:36.789 --> 01:37:40.710]  You have to convert to Islam and join the gang for your own protection in prison.
[01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:44.050]  Well, you can imagine that they would want to off Tommy Robinson.
[01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:45.550]  He's been attacked in prison before.
[01:37:45.789 --> 01:37:49.789]  So he's in prison for publishing a video on Twitter, believe it or not.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.920]  And the judge sentenced him to 18 months.
[01:37:52.979 --> 01:37:54.039]  He'll probably serve nine.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.300]  But for his own protection, they put him in segregation.
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.840]  They put him in solitary confinement.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:06.739]  So he's in this tiny cell, and he's only let out now, luckily now, luckily, they're giving him exercise every day.
[01:38:06.859 --> 01:38:08.100]  They weren't even doing that before.
[01:38:09.439 --> 01:38:11.300]  He is in solitary confinement.
[01:38:11.439 --> 01:38:14.100]  No one is meant to do nine months of solitary confinement.
[01:38:14.279 --> 01:38:17.600]  That's how they tried to get Julian Assange to go mad.
[01:38:17.979 --> 01:38:23.800]  I mean, even in the few hours I was in jail with no human contact, no phone, you start to get a little stir-crazy.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.359]  Imagine nine months of solitary.
[01:38:26.659 --> 01:38:29.420]  And that's the UK. And where is the clamor?
[01:38:29.619 --> 01:38:31.279]  Where are the civil liberties unions?
[01:38:31.479 --> 01:38:36.460]  And I like the fact that Elon Musk is poking at the UK. Alex, you hear me say it?
[01:38:36.659 --> 01:38:44.699]  I've always said going to Europe is like getting into a dystopian time machine and seeing five years into your own future if you don't change course.
[01:38:44.979 --> 01:38:47.439]  The UK is so far down that road.
[01:38:47.859 --> 01:38:49.899]  Canada is halfway down that road.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.319]  And my warning to your listeners, Alex, is do not go down that road.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.000]  Fight for free speech.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:06.260]  It's easier to fight for it in the first ditch We're good to go.
[01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:27.069]  We're good to go.
[01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:35.949]  Well, and compare how these Hamas activists are treated versus the peaceful truckers.
[01:39:36.109 --> 01:39:43.869]  Peaceful truckers, Canadian citizens standing up for freedoms, hot tubs and bouncy castles and waving the Canadian flag.
[01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:50.170]  Trudeau calls martial law, freezes and seizes bank accounts, and deploys riot horses.
[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:58.689]  Versus these Hamas activists, often engaging in trespass, mischief, uttering threats, violence, Jewish schools being burnt and shot.
[01:39:59.149 --> 01:40:01.090]  And Trudeau gives them the kid glove treatment.
[01:40:01.409 --> 01:40:01.609]  Why?
[01:40:02.869 --> 01:40:03.409]  Demographics.
[01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.989]  Why?
[01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:08.869]  Because Canada has had open borders even worse than you have, Alex, in the States.
[01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.170]  So you've got to protect your freedoms.
[01:40:11.170 --> 01:40:14.010]  And one of the ways your freedoms can be eroded...
[01:40:14.319 --> 01:40:21.220]  Is if literally millions of people come into America or Canada or the UK from countries that don't value freedom.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:28.659]  And just because they get on a plane and fly to New York or Toronto or London doesn't mean they change their cultural values.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:38.720]  If you are bringing millions of people into America that don't believe in freedom, don't be surprised when a generation from now they vote for parties that don't believe in freedom.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.800]  They conduct themselves in the street in a way that's unfree or violent.
[01:40:44.089 --> 01:40:49.510]  Immigration is absolutely the most important issue that affects all others.
[01:40:49.829 --> 01:40:56.010]  That's why I'm hoping that Trump can save America and maybe knock some sense into us too about our own border situation.
[01:40:56.329 --> 01:41:00.890]  And on the free speech front, just to illustrate how it's here close to home.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:12.220]  Since May 31st, twice, the Justice Department, who's assigned federal trustees to our bankruptcy, which they can do, they do it rarely, have tried to close us without court orders twice.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:19.479]  The judge fired the last U.S. trustee June 14th, then again last Thursday.
[01:41:20.869 --> 01:41:24.949]  They tried to illegally shut us down again, or now two weeks ago.
[01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:27.050]  The judge said the sale never happened.
[01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:28.289]  It was a fraudulent auction.
[01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:30.189]  That happened in court yesterday.
[01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:31.909]  No news coverage of that.
[01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:36.350]  I mean, they are desperate to silence us because the truth is powerful.
[01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:38.810]  The truth is contagious.
[01:41:39.409 --> 01:41:41.250]  And the truth will win.
[01:41:41.369 --> 01:41:43.970]  So that shows the tide is turning globally.
[01:41:44.649 --> 01:41:47.850]  Populists are being elected everywhere, but the system is coming down quickly.
[01:41:48.579 --> 01:41:55.779]  The UN, NATO, Eric Schmidt of Google saying we need the UN and NATO to shut down American speech and speech in Europe.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:01.619]  We have the G20 saying with this new compact that they want to shut down speech and prosecute people, have internet IDs.
[01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:03.739]  The globalists aren't giving up.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.579]  They are coming at humanity right now and taking the mask off.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:14.159]  You know, Americans alone voted for Trump and Trump is an America first president.
[01:42:14.479 --> 01:42:21.939]  But speaking as a Canadian, I have to tell you that the rest of the world has already benefited and will benefit from a Trump presidency.
[01:42:22.279 --> 01:42:31.520]  First of all, the risk of world war will be greatly diminished despite what I think Britain and France and some others and even Biden are trying to do right now.
[01:42:31.659 --> 01:42:33.659]  I'm terrified by the next two months.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.819]  I think Trump will bring peace to the world.
[01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:42.720]  I think his alliance with Elon Musk and Twitter being a free speech platform is one of the most important things in the world.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:53.560]  And whether it's the UK or Canada or Brazil, having the free speech champion Elon Musk in the close sort of kitchen cabinet of Trump will help save the world.
[01:42:53.659 --> 01:42:57.079]  And I know that's not an American first idea.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.380]  Americans care about America as they should.
[01:42:59.579 --> 01:43:06.319]  But I want to let you know as a friend of America from the outside, How beneficial it will be to our freedoms too.
[01:43:06.739 --> 01:43:11.460]  Don't think that Twitter wasn't censoring us here before Elon Musk took over.
[01:43:11.699 --> 01:43:15.119]  Do you see how the Europeans are trying to censor Elon Musk?
[01:43:15.359 --> 01:43:16.520]  Threatening him with arrest.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.260]  Threatening to compel him to come and testify.
[01:43:19.539 --> 01:43:23.520]  The Brazilian communist, the Australian globalist.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:27.119]  They are all scared of it, and X is educating people worldwide.
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:32.859]  America is now a major beachhead of freedom if we can just get Trump in in the next 54 days.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:37.439]  Ezra Levant, everybody should follow you on X at Ezra Levant, rebelnews.com.
[01:43:37.699 --> 01:43:38.520]  Incredible work.
[01:43:38.619 --> 01:43:39.260]  God bless you.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.560]  And listen, I think you understand how bad this is.
[01:43:42.699 --> 01:43:51.899]  I mean, when you start sticking any group somewhere and they can't go out and exercise free speech for their safety, we've got one leg into Nazi Germany.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.020]  This is not good.
[01:43:53.909 --> 01:43:55.670]  Thank you, my friend, for your solidarity.
[01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:57.289]  The feeling is mutual.
[01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:02.210]  You have paid a greater price than almost anyone else in the free speech battles.
[01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:07.250]  And people who have benefited from your battles will never properly thank you.
[01:44:07.369 --> 01:44:18.569]  But you are the pointy edge of the spear in the battle for free speech, the most important freedom The first freedom, the strategic freedom on which every other freedom relies.
[01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:23.970]  And even those of us in other countries have a debt to you for fighting against censorship.
[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:25.770]  And I thank you for that, my friend.
[01:44:25.949 --> 01:44:26.689]  I thank you, Ezra.
[01:44:26.729 --> 01:44:27.189]  You do as well.
[01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.750]  God bless you.
[01:44:27.909 --> 01:44:28.750]  And Tommy's in prison.
[01:44:28.869 --> 01:44:29.810]  We need to pray for him and support him.
[01:44:29.869 --> 01:44:30.149]  Thank you.
[01:44:30.529 --> 01:44:32.710]  A lot of our people have been tortured, you name it.
[01:44:32.829 --> 01:44:33.970]  He's been tortured in prison.
[01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:35.250]  This is like the third time.
[01:44:35.529 --> 01:44:36.170]  What a man.
[01:44:36.329 --> 01:44:38.770]  I told him, don't go back to the UK. And he did it.
[01:44:38.829 --> 01:44:40.029]  He said, nope, I'm gonna do it.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.439]  Alright, I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:44:42.819 --> 01:44:44.220]  We're going to go to your calls here.
[01:44:44.399 --> 01:44:45.420]  I'm going to get to everybody.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:53.220]  Devon, Al Keller, Daniel, Dale, George, Joshua, Ed, Mike, and others on the World War III situation.
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:55.079]  But I promised to get to some of the other news.
[01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:56.720]  We're starting to right there.
[01:44:56.819 --> 01:45:01.579]  I wanted to talk to a real person it just happened to before we get to their plans for all of us.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.479]  Because they're trying to get through Ezra Levant to get to us.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.699]  They're trying to get through Trump to get to you and me.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.180]  They're trying to get through Elon Musk to get to all of us.
[01:45:08.319 --> 01:45:09.560]  We're in this in solidarity.
[01:45:10.399 --> 01:45:12.840]  And, you know, you may hate the Islamists.
[01:45:13.119 --> 01:45:14.060]  Well, they have a right to speech.
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.180]  You may hate the Jews.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:15.939]  They have a right to speech.
[01:45:16.979 --> 01:45:21.300]  But, you know, you may love a group.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.840]  You may hate a group.
[01:45:22.979 --> 01:45:27.119]  The point is, is that we all have to have these rights or we all lose them.
[01:45:27.319 --> 01:45:30.079]  And for radio listeners, I'll read the headlines out of them.
[01:45:30.119 --> 01:45:35.039]  These are hard to believe, but this is stuff recently in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and everywhere.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:37.140]  The First Amendment is out of control.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:38.439]  The Constitution is sacred.
[01:45:39.289 --> 01:45:40.390]  It is also dangerous.
[01:45:41.010 --> 01:45:42.569]  Elections are bad for democracy.
[01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:43.930]  Don't ask questions.
[01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:47.250]  I mean, this is really going on.
[01:45:48.829 --> 01:45:50.569]  This is happening.
[01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:53.050]  Elections are bad for freedom.
[01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:55.229]  The First Amendment is out of control.
[01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:57.649]  I mean, get rid of the Constitution.
[01:45:58.250 --> 01:46:01.449]  And then we get crap like this, and I'll go to your calls after that.
[01:46:02.939 --> 01:46:04.720]  This has gone viral since last night.
[01:46:04.819 --> 01:46:12.300]  The CEO of Axios melts down over Elon Musk telling ex-users, you are the media now.
[01:46:13.159 --> 01:46:16.840]  Mounts passionate defense of dying legacy media.
[01:46:17.079 --> 01:46:21.300]  And then the morning psycho Joe defends it and has this timid clap.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:26.520]  This is like a ghost dance or something.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.220]  When your society's already collapsed and you just try to do a ritual to bring it back.
[01:46:31.239 --> 01:46:32.779]  The corporate media is a joke.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.359]  Somebody with a camera showing what a real event did in live time, that's real journalism.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:41.159]  And somebody giving their view on something, that's your rights.
[01:46:41.359 --> 01:46:43.319]  That's your punditry.
[01:46:44.699 --> 01:46:47.760]  So, the corporate media is plunging.
[01:46:47.899 --> 01:46:49.220]  The real media is exploding.
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.840]  And by the real media, it's just full on.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.779]  All views, all ideas, people researching it, giving their view on it.
[01:46:58.069 --> 01:46:59.829]  That is decentralization of power.
[01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:02.250]  This is bigger than the Gutenberg printing press.
[01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:09.630]  And you have this dead corporate media waking up in a coffin that the fact that it's dead and panicking.
[01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:12.369]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:17.869]  And being elitist, saying, well, we really are the elite, and we decide what's real.
[01:47:17.949 --> 01:47:18.949]  We're the fact checkers.
[01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:20.270]  You're a joke.
[01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:26.010]  You're the most inaccurate, mercenary, liars the world's ever seen.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.319]  And this is the most unintentional comedy ever.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.180]  Here's the clip.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:33.680]  Everything we do is under fire.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:39.720]  Elon Musk sits on Twitter every day or X today saying like, we are the media.
[01:47:39.979 --> 01:47:41.000]  You are the media.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:44.619]  My message to Elon Musk is bulls**t.
[01:47:44.659 --> 01:47:45.880]  You're not the media.
[01:47:46.319 --> 01:47:59.430]  You having- You having a blue check mark, a Twitter handle, and 300 words of cleverness doesn't make you a reporter.
[01:47:59.829 --> 01:48:02.109]  You don't do that by popping off on Twitter.
[01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:04.750]  You don't do that by having an opinion.
[01:48:05.729 --> 01:48:08.090]  You do it by doing the hard work.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.180]  Yeah, come on.
[01:48:10.279 --> 01:48:11.000]  Slow clap, everybody.
[01:48:12.039 --> 01:48:16.399]  First of all, I've got to say, extraordinary content.
[01:48:16.739 --> 01:48:18.560]  It needed to be said.
[01:48:18.699 --> 01:48:21.060]  It continues to need to be said.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:32.239]  When all of the garbage is flying around on social media, lying about reporters, lying about the hard work they do, lying about the hard work editors do, lying about everything.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:32.979]  Lying.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.020]  Trump is Hitler, now he's got buddies with him.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:40.300]  And look at Al Sharpton.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.960]  Ha, he's the media.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:49.060]  Social media, people lying every day, every hour, every minute.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:50.760]  These guys have almost no audience.
[01:48:51.779 --> 01:48:52.800]  You're rejected.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:53.800]  People don't like you.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:54.460]  We're going to break.
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:49:00.020]  We're coming back with your phone calls in the World War III. New developments just came out.
[01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:01.579]  We'll get to all that next hour.
[01:49:03.699 --> 01:49:05.180]  The people's media is here.
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:06.359]  What people have chosen?
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.640]  Who's really accurate?
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.340]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.579]  But the globalists put trillions of dollars into the globalist media.
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:19.560]  We need your support to stay on air, even if we're super popular.
[01:49:19.899 --> 01:49:21.199]  So, support us.
[01:49:21.399 --> 01:49:22.260]  Support yourself.

[01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.770]  We need funds.

[01:50:17.729 --> 01:50:29.770]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:31.569]  They are a private agency.
[01:50:31.829 --> 01:50:36.090]  Some of the president's elect advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[01:50:36.369 --> 01:50:38.869]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:39.649]  No.
[01:50:40.829 --> 01:50:46.390]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[01:50:46.770 --> 01:50:47.069]  No.
[01:50:47.329 --> 01:51:00.289]  Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[01:51:00.489 --> 01:51:07.590]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:29.859]  And that's why I'm so excited to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration We're good to go.
[01:51:35.899 --> 01:51:39.180]  At auction, Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:42.039]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:44.479]  But regardless, backups are being set up.
[01:51:44.699 --> 01:51:46.859]  New systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[01:51:47.079 --> 01:51:56.180]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[01:51:56.479 --> 01:51:56.920]  And...
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:03.119]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[01:52:03.399 --> 01:52:13.680]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.800]  Here it is on screen.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:15.979]  Iconic.
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:26.500]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:38.229]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday, last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[01:52:38.590 --> 01:52:44.930]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[01:52:45.369 --> 01:52:48.010]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:50.090]  Back to back to back.
[01:52:50.289 --> 01:52:51.090]  That's right.
[01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:54.229]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:58.949]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:01.090]  He won in 16. He won in...
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:13.279]  We've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:19.579]  And to do that, he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[01:53:19.699 --> 01:53:24.880]  The most reach we've ever had, thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[01:53:25.039 --> 01:53:29.659]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[01:53:29.819 --> 01:53:43.279]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if Infowars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get the Trump Patriot apparel, get the posters, there's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[01:53:43.539 --> 01:53:46.159]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.399]  Thanks for your support.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.859]  God bless and good luck.
[01:53:49.079 --> 01:53:53.079]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[01:53:53.319 --> 01:53:54.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:15.409]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:54:15.409 --> 01:54:17.130]  I'm hosting all four hours today.
[01:54:17.329 --> 01:54:18.750]  Owen Schroer coming up 3 p.m.
[01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:19.729]  Central today.
[01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:25.829]  Maria Z filling in this week of Thanksgiving for the great Harrison Smith.
[01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:27.890]  Weekday mornings, American Journal, 8 a.m.
[01:54:28.050 --> 01:54:37.189]  Central on the vaunted, censored, attacked, embattled, battle-hardened InfoWars Command Center in Central Texas.
[01:54:38.250 --> 01:54:38.789]  Alright.
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:48.779]  I said I'd cover all the news, and I've really done okay on the World War III developments, but I got the free speech stuff some, but I didn't even scratch the surface.
[01:54:48.779 --> 01:54:49.819]  It's just so much.
[01:54:50.039 --> 01:54:51.659]  I got all this other stuff too.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.220]  Gosh.
[01:54:52.579 --> 01:54:55.960]  But I promised your calls on the World War III situation.
[01:54:56.939 --> 01:54:58.920]  NATO is going to full war.
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.039]  They've gone to full war.
[01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:02.840]  They're trying to elicit Russia into a giant response.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.699]  I mean, I just already recapped it earlier, but...
[01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:11.130]  Bombing them with high-tech missiles, saying they're looking to give nukes to Ukraine.
[01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:15.149]  The head of the NATO committee recommending sneak attacks on Russia.
[01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:16.930]  That's how you get a nuclear war.
[01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:24.449]  I mean, they are doing exactly what you do to push provocation and escalation to levels never before seen.
[01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:25.449]  I mean, it's so epic.
[01:55:25.590 --> 01:55:26.329]  It's so insane.
[01:55:26.449 --> 01:55:27.109]  It's so dangerous.
[01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:28.770]  It's so out of control.
[01:55:29.729 --> 01:55:30.930]  It's so historical.
[01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:32.130]  It's so evil.
[01:55:33.449 --> 01:55:36.770]  That I feel guilty when I cover other stuff, but it all ties into the same thing.
[01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:40.430]  These globalists are enslaving us, poisoning us, attacking us.
[01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:47.670]  You've got heads of federal agencies caught by James O'Keefe admitting the shots don't work and it's all about money and power and control and all that.
[01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:50.350]  We already know all that, but my God, it's all premeditated.
[01:55:50.489 --> 01:55:51.529]  These are bad people!
[01:55:52.130 --> 01:55:54.109]  I mean...
[01:55:55.689 --> 01:55:56.289]  Uh-huh.
[01:55:56.890 --> 01:55:58.170]  Let's just go to your phone calls.
[01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:03.210]  All right, I don't want to cut people off, because the first five minutes isn't carried by the radio stations.
[01:56:03.210 --> 01:56:04.550]  We're over 450 now.
[01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:06.590]  We're getting new stations every day.
[01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:11.529]  And that's important, because they could kill, God forbid, Elon Musk or whatever.
[01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:13.949]  We are on so many radio stations.
[01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:17.270]  That's how when they took me off everything else on the internet, deplatformed us.
[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.970]  We had Infowars.com, we built Bandot Video, and we had...
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:29.680]  200 and something stations when they did that, and then it grew to 300, 350, and then now the last few months of all the attempts to take us off air, it's 450 something last week.
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:35.039]  And I just, I'm so thankful to stations, but that's why people on the internet are like, why are there breaks?
[01:56:35.239 --> 01:56:36.119]  That's the young people.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:41.380]  Well, it's called network radio and TV. That's why when you watch the NFL, there's like 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[01:56:42.119 --> 01:56:47.640]  Or the NBA or a baseball game, when you watch cable or local TV, you'll see local ads and you'll see national ads.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:50.159]  Half the ads are for the program.
[01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:53.590]  To fund it, and then the other half for the local station.
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.810]  And for older folks, you're like, yeah, we know this.
[01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:59.210]  A lot of young people are like, what are these ads?
[01:56:59.729 --> 01:57:01.189]  Why does Alex Jones have ads?
[01:57:02.210 --> 01:57:09.789]  Because we're on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds of cable systems and hundreds of UHF and VHF stations.
[01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:11.510]  People say, well, why don't you put a list of them up?
[01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:12.609]  We used to.
[01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:15.010]  The globalists harassed them.
[01:57:17.779 --> 01:57:23.140]  When they were trying to get discovery on us, they kept saying, give us a list of stations, blah, blah, blah, all this other crap.
[01:57:24.079 --> 01:57:39.060]  And actually, we had to give them a list at the time, and when they harassed them, we lost a few, like, 50,000 water in the capital of California that covered six, seven states.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.000]  But we gained a lot more.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:46.920]  And when they would harass stations, they'd go, you know, most of them said, you know what, we're going to take him from nighttime to primetime.
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:47.460]  Screw you.
[01:57:47.859 --> 01:57:48.920]  So it balanced out.
[01:57:49.039 --> 01:57:55.500]  But he never learned to read or write so well, but he could take down the new world order like he's ringing a bell.
[01:57:56.279 --> 01:57:58.939]  Well, I can actually read ultra good.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:03.579]  I'm not the best speller around, but the American people are Johnny.
[01:58:04.489 --> 01:58:09.310]  And the New World Order is the devil that went down to Georgia looking for a soul to steal.
[01:58:09.789 --> 01:58:11.890]  He was in a bind because he was way behind.
[01:58:11.890 --> 01:58:13.090]  He was looking to make a deal.
[01:58:15.289 --> 01:58:16.550]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:22.329 --> 01:58:23.069]  Let's do this.
[01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:24.050]  Let's take your phone calls.
[01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:24.930]  Let's take a lot of them.
[01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:30.369]  Then we've got a very informed researcher known as dark journalist.
[01:58:31.579 --> 01:58:36.300]  On the COG and their plans to declare a national emergency ahead of Trump getting in in 54 days.
[01:58:37.279 --> 01:58:41.399]  And launching World War III deeper into nuclear war.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:42.859]  That's coming up.
[01:58:42.939 --> 01:58:45.380]  But right now, let's go in the order that your calls came in.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.739]  Devon in Florida.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:47.720]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:58:49.739 --> 01:58:50.500]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:50.539 --> 01:58:50.979]  How are you doing?
[01:58:51.279 --> 01:58:51.539]  Good.
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:59.779]  I see that there's really only one way to stop World War III. On your show, you say, if you're listening, you are the resistance.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:02.439]  But how are we to resist if we don't resist?
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:08.260]  All we do is sit with our phones in our hands and watch it go by like it's some type of content to be absorbed.
[01:59:08.739 --> 01:59:15.100]  The only thing I can see is that we come together, all of us, in person, and actually do something about it.
[01:59:15.199 --> 01:59:17.739]  We can't just sit around and let the world be destroyed.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:26.659]  Okay, so we have a peaceful march on Washington, and then the feds detonate a truck bomb and blame it on us.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.140]  What do we do then?
[01:59:29.649 --> 01:59:31.609]  We die as martyrs.
[01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:34.630]  I don't think they will detonate a truck mom on us.
[01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:37.170]  If they detonate a truck mom on us, better.
[01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:49.369]  It'll show us to be Listen, I understand at an instinctive level the idea of marching out, you know, that would be war generally in the archetype against something.
[01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:52.090]  It's how you would fix things 100 years ago, 500 years ago.
[01:59:52.989 --> 01:59:56.310]  We're getting people elected that are trying to stop this.
[01:59:56.590 --> 02:00:00.029]  We are, you got attorney generals that are going after the globalists.
[02:00:00.090 --> 02:00:01.770]  The globalists admit their program's in big trouble.
[02:00:02.329 --> 02:00:09.069]  90 plus percent of war, the Pentagon says, and I know it's true, I don't just believe them, that's a true statement, is informational warfare.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.840]  It's more than 90 now.
[02:00:10.939 --> 02:00:11.939]  It's like 95%.
[02:00:11.939 --> 02:00:13.340]  I agree with those assessments.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:14.319]  They used to say it's 90%.
[02:00:14.319 --> 02:00:15.720]  It's more like 95% now.
[02:00:16.439 --> 02:00:16.760]  So...
[02:00:18.779 --> 02:00:26.399]  Getting Trump to come out and call for global peace, exposing that NATO started this war, that they're sleepwalking and send a thermonuclear war.
[02:00:27.539 --> 02:00:28.920]  I mean, that is important.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.039]  People said, you know, we couldn't vote our way out of election fraud.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:32.659]  I looked at the numbers, interviewed all the experts.
[02:00:33.039 --> 02:00:34.899]  We knew how much fraud they had baked in.
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:38.680]  We could also have lawyers there to mitigate it and block, you know, the 1 a.m.
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:39.699]  deliveries.
[02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:42.560]  This time the lawyers were there when the deliveries came in, the key battlegrounds.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:43.220]  We stopped them.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:53.960]  Okay, so 5 million people marched to D.C. peacefully, and then the world sees we don't want war.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.460]  I agree with you.
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:04.079]  I mean, I remember when we had the lockdowns early on, we went and protested in the first few weeks of it at the state capitol and other areas.
[02:01:04.159 --> 02:01:06.039]  People did it around the country and brought attention to it.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.359]  Everything we said then was proven to be true.
[02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:16.029]  And so, yeah, that gave others the current, they closed city parks, and I went into them, and the police threatened to arrest us, and then said, yeah, you're right, we're not going to do it, there is no law.
[02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:22.010]  They closed Barton Springs, I went and jumped in that in front of the police, and encouraged others to do it around the world.
[02:01:22.329 --> 02:01:29.350]  I mean, I am thinking we should have, I mean, I guess I could say, hey, let's have a march to the Capitol.
[02:01:29.609 --> 02:01:35.329]  The first march, it was just a few days promoted, we'd probably have 500 people at it, and then the next march would have 10,000.
[02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:38.590]  I mean, you're in command now, Devon, what do we do?
[02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:41.710]  I say we all come together.
[02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.850]  Millions of us.
[02:01:43.409 --> 02:01:44.329]  They are small.
[02:01:44.569 --> 02:01:45.689]  They're a small minority.
[02:01:45.989 --> 02:01:48.729]  And they run us like we are just dogs.
[02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:51.970]  Well, I agree with you that we need to be out demonstrating.
[02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:57.010]  And Trump needs to call for peaceful national demonstrations.
[02:01:58.329 --> 02:01:59.449]  How fat I was then.
[02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:02.710]  Against this World War III escalation.
[02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:03.329]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:08.090]  Let's go to Nora in South Carolina.
[02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:08.829]  Nora, you're on the air.
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:12.000]  Alex, my family and I have been watching you for decades.
[02:02:12.199 --> 02:02:12.779]  We love you.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:21.659]  Thank you for everything you do and all your watchers and all the people that give us just hope that there are other people out there that are awake.
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.180]  Thank God.
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:28.340]  Alex, I'm a teacher, and I homeschool my kids now by the grace of God.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:33.119]  I want to urge all parents out there to take their kids out of these indoctrination camps.
[02:02:33.619 --> 02:02:36.619]  Because it starts at the child.
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:40.779]  Yeah, that's really the biggest thing is, and by the way, private schools are just as bad or worse.
[02:02:40.899 --> 02:02:46.239]  They're getting grants from the BlackRock companies to teach little boys to cut their weenies off, and little girls.
[02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:53.159]  So yeah, remove yourself from any globalist indoctrination point.
[02:02:53.979 --> 02:02:55.100]  A hundred percent.
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:03:01.010]  And by the way, DNI is getting removed everywhere as well, or DNI. DEI, I always say it.
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:03.630]  DEI. DEI? Yes.
[02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:08.449]  Parents have been tricked to believe that it's too complicated to teach your own kids.
[02:03:08.590 --> 02:03:09.989]  It is the most natural thing on earth.
[02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:11.829]  Your kids observe and learn by observing.
[02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:14.789]  You teach them what God puts in your heart.
[02:03:14.989 --> 02:03:19.010]  Put God first, your family second, and then everything else falls into place in this world.
[02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:27.529]  They have the kids and every word is crafted to create minions that serve them and will turn against their own parents.
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:34.100]  And you see it with the secrets that they create with kids with their gender confusion and all this pedophilia that's going on.
[02:03:34.159 --> 02:03:38.699]  They brainwashed and kidnapped Elon Musk's son.
[02:03:39.399 --> 02:03:41.000]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.399]  And they're doing it over and over again.
[02:03:42.399 --> 02:03:45.920]  It's becoming more and more public that parents are divorcing over the situation.
[02:03:46.119 --> 02:03:47.899]  Dad doesn't want their kid to transition.
[02:03:48.119 --> 02:03:48.680]  It's too late.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.739]  They are aggressively doing it.
[02:03:50.819 --> 02:03:51.420]  It's everywhere.
[02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:55.010]  Yes, they're taking the kids away from their parents now.
[02:03:55.149 --> 02:03:56.289]  This is so satanic.
[02:03:56.449 --> 02:03:57.590]  Parents have to stand up.
[02:03:57.710 --> 02:03:59.069]  Pull your kids out of these schools.
[02:03:59.229 --> 02:03:59.850]  We have to unite.
[02:04:00.029 --> 02:04:04.390]  Instead of going to March in Washington, I believe the answer is a peaceful sit-down.
[02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:07.649]  Instead of a government shutdown, we need a public shutdown.
[02:04:07.949 --> 02:04:10.689]  Yes, we will struggle for a week or two weeks or a month.
[02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:13.369]  We need to flip and sit down.
[02:04:13.590 --> 02:04:14.270]  No one go to work.
[02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:15.189]  No, I totally agree.
[02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:16.869]  I'm going to coin a term.
[02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:21.930]  I've coined a lot, like 360 win and ultra green and left-right paradigm.
[02:04:22.369 --> 02:04:27.609]  I'm going to coin a term right now, micro exodus.
[02:04:28.210 --> 02:04:30.250]  And what does the Bible say to the Israelites?
[02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:36.710]  Go out of Egypt and the Bible be in the world, but not of the world.
[02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:41.210]  And so everyone, you can homeschool a child.
[02:04:41.489 --> 02:04:42.529]  I've done it with mine.
[02:04:43.289 --> 02:04:44.569]  We've done a mix of both.
[02:04:44.689 --> 02:04:48.909]  But the point is, you can do it from 8 a.m.
[02:04:48.989 --> 02:04:50.470]  to 11 if you actually do it.
[02:04:50.489 --> 02:04:55.250]  You'll get way more education than in these schools that are designed to indoctrinate them.
[02:04:55.289 --> 02:04:56.229]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:57.670]  That's where the royal revolution starts.
[02:04:58.930 --> 02:04:59.569]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:59.729 --> 02:05:01.550]  And I'm starting to make curriculum.
[02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:07.649]  I just published my first book that exalts God and teaches people that words and thoughts are more powerful than we think.
[02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:10.010]  They either help us to fly or they lead us to think.
[02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:12.329]  The question is, which do you believe?
[02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:17.090]  Words that bring life or words that deceive?
[02:05:17.369 --> 02:05:19.430]  Those are the first two pages of my children's book.
[02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:20.829]  It's called More Precious Than Pearls.
[02:05:20.829 --> 02:05:21.989]  It's on Amazon.com.
[02:05:22.199 --> 02:05:23.739]  My name is Nora McIlwain.
[02:05:23.939 --> 02:05:26.779]  I am trying to help parents to educate their own children.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:31.140]  I'm trying to put God first and just show people that we're being deceived.
[02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:33.279]  The devil is the author of confusion.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.319]  The lying is a tactic to confuse everybody.
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.880]  It is an info war.
[02:05:38.039 --> 02:05:39.899]  If you follow God, you'll find the truth.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.760]  Alex, you are paving the way.
[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:43.100]  Thank God for you.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.340]  Thank God for others like you.
[02:05:44.859 --> 02:05:46.880]  We've got to team up and we've got to do this together.
[02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:50.340]  I mean, we don't want to be annihilated because that's the globalist plan.
[02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:51.750]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:53.090]  I'll check your book out.
[02:05:53.210 --> 02:05:53.550]  Thank you.
[02:05:54.569 --> 02:05:55.550]  Maybe everyone is a guest.
[02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:59.949]  Guys, print up her book for me, like a synopsis of it.
[02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.609]  All right.
[02:06:03.170 --> 02:06:05.109]  I just threw the name out, Micro Exodus.
[02:06:05.329 --> 02:06:06.649]  That's not the best term.
[02:06:07.829 --> 02:06:10.970]  An individual declaration of exodus.
[02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:14.550]  And I know on the service it's hard.
[02:06:17.309 --> 02:06:18.789]  But, you gotta do it.
[02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:19.909]  I mean, I know a lot of parents.
[02:06:20.090 --> 02:06:20.810]  I've got four children.
[02:06:21.609 --> 02:06:27.029]  22, 20, 16, and 7. And I know a ton of parents.
[02:06:27.729 --> 02:06:29.310]  As you do of your parents.
[02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:37.689]  And, I know parents from the three biggest Christian schools in Austin.
[02:06:40.579 --> 02:06:51.380]  That just in the last two years now secretly teach, Billy has two daddies, Sally has two mommies, you're really a girl, you're really a boy, don't tell your parents.
[02:06:51.539 --> 02:06:54.579]  I mean, it is, they're getting grants, folks, from the Pritzkers and the rest of them.
[02:06:54.619 --> 02:06:55.800]  This is criminal grooming.
[02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:59.189]  It's beyond a teacher raping your child.
[02:06:59.329 --> 02:07:00.090]  That's bad enough.
[02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:05.189]  This is raping their mind and getting them ready to go into the cult and be sterilized.
[02:07:05.609 --> 02:07:08.689]  It is outrageous crime hiding in plain view.
[02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:10.729]  And I'm not defending public schools.
[02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:11.829]  Everybody's obsessed with public schools.
[02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:15.050]  Folks, the more elite school it is, the worse.
[02:07:15.250 --> 02:07:15.869]  Listen to Elon.
[02:07:17.289 --> 02:07:18.529]  He's got 12 kids.
[02:07:18.689 --> 02:07:19.569]  One of his oldest sons.
[02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.210]  His favorite.
[02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:21.449]  Or one of his favorites.
[02:07:22.810 --> 02:07:23.750]  A protege.
[02:07:23.989 --> 02:07:24.529]  Super smart.
[02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:30.500]  The baby mama says, hey, this is the best school in California.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.199]  He's busy, you know, running 12 companies.
[02:07:34.159 --> 02:07:45.300]  Puts his son in, and then they brainwash him, turn him against the dad, get him in the cult, and then now he's denounced his father and has reportedly been chemically sterilized.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:47.279]  And Elon Musk said, my son is dead.
[02:07:47.439 --> 02:07:51.340]  Yes, he may rise from the ashes, but irrevocable damage.
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:54.300]  So, and now look what they got to deal with.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:59.920]  Again, to these Satanists, that was a real prize.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.159]  I mean, if I was them, but I guess I'm not a Satanist.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:10.239]  You might want to pass over Elon Musk's son.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:13.340]  But that's their arrogance.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:16.859]  So the more elite schools are the worst.
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.479]  And I know a lot of people...
[02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:23.489]  And I learned about this like 15 years ago when this wasn't the big top topic.
[02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:27.869]  I was covering it then, though, 25 years ago, about the Tavisock Institute, the transgenderism, all that.
[02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:30.869]  Now it was a global population plan to break up society.
[02:08:31.069 --> 02:08:41.609]  And if you'll accept two men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, clones, chimerics, cross-species creatures, island of Dr. Maru type stuff.
[02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.350]  And I just kept running into...
[02:08:48.329 --> 02:08:59.850]  The children of the globalist billionaires that you run into and you know are devil worshippers, transgender, psychotics.
[02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:03.189]  The elites, like half their kids commit suicide.
[02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:08.510]  Like Anderson Cooper, you know what happened to his brother?
[02:09:10.449 --> 02:09:14.229]  I mean, they induct these people into hardcore cults, folks.
[02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.430]  But there's a taboo, and there should be, against molesting children.
[02:09:19.930 --> 02:09:21.050]  So they go, well, how do we...
[02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:23.789]  Okay, we'll cut them up, which is even better.
[02:09:24.029 --> 02:09:25.890]  It's the energy they want of hurting the child.
[02:09:26.590 --> 02:09:32.970]  So because no one ever imagined something that bad, they do that and get an in-run around, and people don't even know how to deal with it.
[02:09:34.029 --> 02:09:36.850]  And so it's all being brainwashed into the cult.
[02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.989]  Pronouns, all...
[02:09:38.989 --> 02:09:41.550]  I know all of you know that, but this is...
[02:09:42.609 --> 02:09:43.609]  Pure Satanism.
[02:09:43.949 --> 02:09:45.130]  Joshua in Idaho.
[02:09:45.329 --> 02:09:45.770]  You're on the air.
[02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:46.149]  Go ahead.
[02:09:47.449 --> 02:09:48.189]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:48.729 --> 02:09:52.229]  I'm praying for you and all of the children in the world, brother.
[02:09:53.409 --> 02:09:55.470]  This situation is mad.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:57.300]  The only word to describe it.
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:03.819]  I couldn't sleep last night with all the news rapidly developing with NATO to send 800,000 troops to Germany.
[02:10:04.119 --> 02:10:15.000]  The Biden administration putting out a statement doubling down on the long-range missile support for Ukraine after Russia already demonstrated MIRV technology.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:20.180]  And now Ukraine has fired another batch of long-range missiles into Russia.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:24.939]  And Russia is officially putting out a statement saying they are preparing for a response.
[02:10:25.849 --> 02:10:30.310]  Then you got NATO warning all the businesses in Europe to prepare for war.
[02:10:30.630 --> 02:10:36.470]  A leaking Biden administration is secretly talking and sending nukes to Ukraine.
[02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:38.289]  I mean, I didn't even believe that.
[02:10:39.689 --> 02:10:41.949]  When I first heard it, I was too dumbfounded.
[02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:54.810]  But then you got the Russian former president and numerous Russian government sources all saying for the U.S. to cease all talks with Ukraine of giving them nuclear weapons.
[02:10:57.069 --> 02:11:07.109]  So, I mean, I had shed some tears thinking of all the children in the major NATO, U.S., Russian cities that will be vaporized.
[02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:08.829]  And I'm not a man to cry.
[02:11:09.210 --> 02:11:13.470]  Well, I'm just glad, and I love the other callers, I'm glad somebody actually called in on the topic.
[02:11:14.289 --> 02:11:19.710]  Because, yeah, we're trying to focus on this, because this, to me, is the big issue.
[02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:36.090]  Yeah, and I mean, I'm not going to hold back tears for millions of children that will be sacrificed in a global nuclear war for all these 70-plus-year-old madmen that are running the US, Russia, China right now.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.659]  They're all near their deathbed.
[02:11:38.939 --> 02:11:47.180]  They're all psychopathic, narcissistic, and they don't seem to mind sacrificing the children of the planet in their last showdown, I guess.
[02:11:47.859 --> 02:11:58.420]  I mean, it's our fault for putting these deathbed geriatric psychos and sickos in power, so it's our job to get them out before they kill us.
[02:11:58.729 --> 02:12:14.270]  I think Trump needs to rally people and go to Washington and just get this madman Biden and this suicidal administration we have out before they sacrifice the children of the U.S. Well, that's what I said last week, and I appreciate your call,
[02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:15.170]  is...
[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:19.770]  I mean, Trump needs to get on his bully pulpit now.
[02:12:20.210 --> 02:12:20.829]  Thank you, sir.
[02:12:21.289 --> 02:12:22.510]  Okay, let's go take another caller.
[02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:23.989]  Let's talk to Ed in Hollywood.
[02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.810]  Ed, you're on the air.
[02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:25.189]  Go ahead.
[02:12:26.729 --> 02:12:27.609]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:28.659 --> 02:12:37.300]  The nuclear war is not going to be like Dr. Strangelove predicted.
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.399]  It's going to be a tactical war.
[02:12:43.199 --> 02:12:47.739]  They have clean bombs now that don't leave any blowback.
[02:12:49.399 --> 02:12:57.539]  They're just going to start volleying these nukes back and forth that don't leave any radiation.
[02:12:59.129 --> 02:13:01.289]  Are you talking about neutron bombs?
[02:13:02.289 --> 02:13:07.649]  It's kind of the opposite of a neutron bomb, but it came from that idea.
[02:13:08.050 --> 02:13:11.289]  It's a bomb that doesn't give off any radiation.
[02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:14.710]  It just does destruction.
[02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:18.850]  Yeah, well, I mean, I know that the nuclear weapons are a lot cleaner now.
[02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:25.930]  Yeah, and they haven't been sitting on their hands for the last...
[02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:33.329]  50 years, they've been developing these things, and they think they can win.
[02:13:33.489 --> 02:13:35.869]  And I believe that there will be a winner.
[02:13:38.329 --> 02:13:43.970]  It'll drag on for a year or so now, and the world is not going to be the same.
[02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:45.069]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:52.529]  Well, you know, there is no such thing as a clean nuke because there's been major studies done on it.
[02:13:52.750 --> 02:14:00.569]  Most of their nuclear reactors, 460 plus that are admitted to be, will melt down.
[02:14:01.329 --> 02:14:07.170]  So that scenario of using cleaner weapons is just not going to happen.
[02:14:08.529 --> 02:14:11.930]  But I think that there will be a winner.
[02:14:12.449 --> 02:14:13.930]  And it's unpredictable.
[02:14:15.329 --> 02:14:19.710]  I don't think that they'll go for mutually assured destruction.
[02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:23.310]  I think that's an obsolete concept.
[02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:31.210]  Well, if you think all these nuclear powers are going to follow that, they would have to have an agreement with each other.
[02:14:33.250 --> 02:14:39.189]  Well, I think they kind of do, but they'll all violate the agreements.
[02:14:40.899 --> 02:14:45.739]  You know, they have agreements, but that's not going to be worth anything.
[02:14:46.239 --> 02:14:53.439]  Yeah, well, see, I mean, the Pentagon has been saying a nuclear war is winnable, and we've seen that pushed for like 25 years at least.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.319]  And I've studied it all, and the reactors, a bunch of them will blow.
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.500]  And as you know, those are thousands of times worse than even dirty bombs, old-fashioned ones.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.420]  And so only someone in the establishment that is either...
[02:15:09.039 --> 02:15:12.199]  Ignorant or psychotic would even believe that, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.880]  So you think the nuclear war is about to kick off?
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.020]  I mean, there's a very good chance of it.
[02:15:16.319 --> 02:15:16.600]  Yes.
[02:15:16.819 --> 02:15:17.659]  Yes, I do.
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.579]  I think it's going to kick off within the next few months.
[02:15:22.239 --> 02:15:29.340]  It may wait until the change of the guard.
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:32.560]  I mean, there's no...
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:37.220]  January 20th is not a deadline by any means.
[02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:43.930]  They could pop one off after that.
[02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:46.470]  Anything else, Ed?
[02:15:48.170 --> 02:15:51.369]  No, but just keep your head down.
[02:15:51.789 --> 02:15:54.270]  I mean, it's about to kick off.
[02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.970]  It is.
[02:15:55.569 --> 02:16:03.390]  You're actually predicting You know, you're right on the money, let's put it that way.
[02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:05.569]  Well, let's just say, I don't want that prediction to come true.
[02:16:05.649 --> 02:16:06.989]  I'm not saying we're going to have a nuclear war.
[02:16:07.449 --> 02:16:08.409]  General Flynn, agree with me.
[02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:10.489]  We are the closest we've ever been.
[02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:11.210]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:15.149]  And I mean, I understand people have a normalcy bias.
[02:16:15.289 --> 02:16:15.850]  I do too.
[02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:24.310]  Okay, I'm sitting here intellectually looking at this, and then I let it sink in, and I'm just like...
[02:16:26.539 --> 02:16:26.960]  Why?
[02:16:27.159 --> 02:16:30.199]  But you look at crazy elites in history, this is par for the course.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:34.260]  So, and then Trump, not a word from him.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:40.819]  And again, I've had crew who are great, because I like crew telling them what they think.
[02:16:41.139 --> 02:16:42.159]  This isn't a cult.
[02:16:43.739 --> 02:16:50.520]  And listeners and family, my phone blows up, all these other talk shows, oh my God, Trump put this bad Surgeon General in.
[02:16:50.559 --> 02:16:51.200]  Yeah, she's terrible.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:52.100]  I can play clips of her.
[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:52.659]  She's horrible.
[02:16:54.299 --> 02:16:56.100]  He's also got Robert F. Kennedy getting in there.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:58.079]  We'll see what happens with all of that.
[02:16:59.079 --> 02:17:00.399]  They tried to kill Trump twice.
[02:17:00.399 --> 02:17:09.739]  He's trying to stop World War III. It doesn't rise to the level, because if we have speech and we stop a nuclear war, we'll block all these policies.
[02:17:10.979 --> 02:17:14.120]  And if Trump tries to push more shots and crap, I'll go after him.
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:16.559]  But that's not where we are.
[02:17:16.659 --> 02:17:18.299]  We need to get him in in 54 days.
[02:17:19.159 --> 02:17:22.079]  We need to stop World War III. We need to stabilize the border.
[02:17:22.219 --> 02:17:23.340]  We need to stop the fentanyl.
[02:17:23.639 --> 02:17:27.520]  We need to kill the DEI brainwashing.
[02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:31.819]  We need to indict the transgender companies for all their crimes, their cult crimes.
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:35.750]  And That's what needs to happen.
[02:17:35.930 --> 02:17:38.430]  It's just that I'm not sitting here.
[02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:40.530]  Most of the appointments are good.
[02:17:41.729 --> 02:17:45.409]  And people want to be holier than thou and obsess on things.
[02:17:47.590 --> 02:17:50.670]  The big existential issue is this war.
[02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:52.549]  The globalists know they're losing.
[02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:53.670]  They're losing total control.
[02:17:54.989 --> 02:17:57.850]  And so they want to turn over the chessboard with a nuclear war.
[02:17:57.969 --> 02:18:00.229]  I mean, they are really doing it, okay?
[02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:03.069]  I mean, we are on the fast track to this soon.
[02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:05.549]  Putin says nuclear war by Christmas, okay?
[02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:07.569]  I don't want to have a nuclear war.
[02:18:13.590 --> 02:18:16.690]  So, that's where we are.
[02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:20.649]  Daniel in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:18:25.159 --> 02:18:25.979]  Yeah, you want to talk, Daniel?
[02:18:26.659 --> 02:18:26.920]  Yeah.
[02:18:27.659 --> 02:18:28.020]  Sorry.
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:29.000]  It's okay.
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:29.280]  Go ahead.
[02:18:29.959 --> 02:18:30.940]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:32.479]  I just wanted to say this.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:33.739]  I love you, man.
[02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:35.100]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:36.500]  And thank you for real news.
[02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:39.280]  Don't ever give in to the globalist scumbags.
[02:18:39.899 --> 02:18:41.799]  And, I mean, I've been watching you for years.
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:43.780]  And I just wanted to say...
[02:18:44.899 --> 02:18:47.520]  I would lie to you if I wasn't scared.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.739]  I mean, me and my wife have been watching you for years, and I don't hide anything from my kids.
[02:18:52.899 --> 02:18:59.540]  I got two young boys at home, and I let them know what's going on to get prepared, my household prepared.
[02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:07.639]  But, you know, the only hope I see in this whole situation is in Jesus Christ.
[02:19:08.059 --> 02:19:11.079]  He's the only one that gives me peace.
[02:19:11.869 --> 02:19:28.549]  And sound mind, you know, 2 Chronicles 7, verse 14 says, You know,
[02:19:28.829 --> 02:19:31.489]  the way I see it, judgment is inevitable.
[02:19:31.729 --> 02:19:34.229]  The Bible tells us in Revelation that judgment is coming.
[02:19:34.510 --> 02:19:39.190]  There's going to be a day where everybody will be judged, the whole world will be destroyed and be rebuilt.
[02:19:40.770 --> 02:19:42.090]  But we can delay it.
[02:19:43.229 --> 02:19:49.510]  There's a framework right here in the Bible that tells us how we as Christians and followers of God...
[02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:50.770]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:51.809]  God bless you, brother.
[02:19:51.969 --> 02:19:54.090]  We need to seek God's face and repent and He will heal our land.
[02:19:54.350 --> 02:19:54.850]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:54.850 --> 02:19:55.170]  Thank you.
[02:19:55.479 --> 02:20:00.659]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:05.219]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[02:20:05.399 --> 02:20:08.020]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[02:20:08.159 --> 02:20:08.899]  I'm still not in shape.
[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:11.219]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:12.299]  Don't tell me eating right.
[02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:13.159]  I'm not gonna buy that shit.
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:13.700]  Ha!
[02:20:13.739 --> 02:20:16.659]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[02:20:17.479 --> 02:20:18.500]  Oh, no.
[02:20:19.719 --> 02:20:21.379]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[02:20:21.659 --> 02:20:27.479]  Well, I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[02:20:27.659 --> 02:20:28.420]  That's why, right here.
[02:20:29.159 --> 02:20:34.260]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:36.040]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:20:36.579 --> 02:20:38.000]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:20:40.739 --> 02:20:44.659]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:47.940]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[02:20:48.559 --> 02:20:51.399]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[02:20:51.559 --> 02:20:54.760]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:56.079]  All right.
[02:20:56.879 --> 02:20:59.940]  We have a lot of guests on, and I had a caller...
[02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:05.909]  Last Friday saying, you've got to get dark journalist on, Daniel.
[02:21:06.770 --> 02:21:10.250]  And he's a really, really smart guy.
[02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:14.430]  And when I say that, I mean, he really knows what he's talking about.
[02:21:14.430 --> 02:21:17.549]  And he can integrate the entire globalist agenda together.
[02:21:17.829 --> 02:21:19.569]  And I agree with his analysis.
[02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:21.510]  I mean, it's like I'm in my own head.
[02:21:22.129 --> 02:21:23.510]  Because we're seeing the same thing.
[02:21:23.770 --> 02:21:25.329]  He's really astute.
[02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:32.409]  And we're going to explain here what this orchestra of manipulation is playing.
[02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:36.510]  And what the song is the drumbeat for.
[02:21:37.649 --> 02:21:54.450]  So we're going to be talking to him with the balance of the broadcast today, interspersed with your calls on the same subject, ongoing World War III, going into full nuclear war, all of the UAVs showing up at Mach 20, flying around, bringing out the secret weapons as a threat to the Russians.
[02:21:56.770 --> 02:21:59.750]  The globalist new humanity would try to reject their new world order.
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:02.860]  Reject eating the bugs, reject the transhumanism.
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:05.059]  So this is their big counter-strike.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:06.399]  The empire is going to strike back.
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:10.860]  Knowing this and then taking action is winning the battle.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:15.159]  So we'll talk to him in a moment, but I want to talk about something really important here.
[02:22:16.139 --> 02:22:17.360]  A few callers back...
[02:22:18.839 --> 02:22:21.719]  Great callers said, listen, just keep fighting, Alex.
[02:22:21.879 --> 02:22:22.159]  Thank you.
[02:22:22.219 --> 02:22:22.840]  We know it's hard.
[02:22:23.159 --> 02:22:25.059]  No, fighting tyranny is not hard.
[02:22:25.319 --> 02:22:26.020]  I love it.
[02:22:26.159 --> 02:22:26.860]  I hate tyrants.
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:27.979]  I love being into freedom.
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:30.200]  I love feeling good about what I'm doing.
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.280]  I love being accurate.
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:33.059]  I love standing up for humanity.
[02:22:33.239 --> 02:22:33.860]  That's my spirit.
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:34.559]  That's my instinct.
[02:22:34.899 --> 02:22:42.819]  Thank you for commissioning me like I'm an officer in the military for the people and keep me on air.
[02:22:43.159 --> 02:22:45.760]  So I tell the callers this every day.
[02:22:45.899 --> 02:22:46.879]  They call me, thank you, thank you.
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:50.440]  We're in a boat that's sinking in freezing water.
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:52.520]  We'll die in two minutes of hypothermia.
[02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:54.979]  It's, you know, ten below zero in the water.
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:57.340]  And people ask, how does that happen?
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:00.399]  Well, salt water gets even colder than 32 degrees.
[02:23:00.579 --> 02:23:06.799]  The point is, we're a couple miles from land, and we're bailing with teacups we have out of the boat.
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:11.280]  And I'm bailing, bailing, bailing, and people are sitting around the boat thanking me for bailing.
[02:23:12.979 --> 02:23:14.040]  I need all of you to bail.
[02:23:14.219 --> 02:23:14.899]  And you are.
[02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:15.760]  You're spreading the word.
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:17.340]  You're raising your kids right.
[02:23:17.479 --> 02:23:18.200]  You're praying.
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:19.299]  You're voting.
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:24.069]  You're This is a critical infrastructure, Infowars.
[02:23:24.229 --> 02:23:36.729]  The bad guys, their main target, the media, is get this off the air because of the guests we have on and the reports and my analysis and everything we do from my mouth to all the other big talk show host ears.
[02:23:37.090 --> 02:23:38.969]  They listen and I talk to them personally.
[02:23:39.329 --> 02:23:40.110]  Elon Musk listens.
[02:23:40.270 --> 02:23:40.930]  Joe Rogan listens.
[02:23:41.049 --> 02:23:41.850]  Tucker Carlson listens.
[02:23:41.989 --> 02:23:42.850]  Vladimir Putin listens.
[02:23:43.149 --> 02:23:43.690]  Trump listens.
[02:23:43.850 --> 02:23:44.610]  Don Jr. listens.
[02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:45.690]  J.D. Vance listens.
[02:23:45.850 --> 02:23:46.909]  Been a big listener for decades.
[02:23:47.639 --> 02:23:49.120]  Met with Vance Person.
[02:23:49.379 --> 02:23:50.100]  Already knew that.
[02:23:50.239 --> 02:23:51.979]  He's tweeted it before, but he told me that in my face.
[02:23:52.379 --> 02:23:55.079]  Vance said, yeah, I'm the VP. A month and a half before it was announced.
[02:23:55.559 --> 02:23:58.280]  Didn't even say don't talk about it, but he knew I knew not to talk about it.
[02:23:58.659 --> 02:24:00.340]  The point is, we're dialed in.
[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:01.719]  We're jacked in to everything.
[02:24:02.719 --> 02:24:03.979]  They want us off the air.
[02:24:04.959 --> 02:24:07.620]  So, we were doing okay two weeks ago.
[02:24:08.159 --> 02:24:14.040]  Whether they took over InfoWars or not, we had enough funds for the Alex Jones Backup Network and other systems.
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.639]  I gave you an accurate report saying we're a little in the black, not much, but we're okay.
[02:24:19.979 --> 02:24:21.459]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[02:24:22.059 --> 02:24:31.360]  When they announced the onion bodice, which the judge officially said did not happen yesterday in court, which had to be in the Zoom thing, my lawyers were there in Houston, to know that.
[02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:34.100]  It was in the news that, yeah, he said the cell adaptment buried.
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:37.299]  People believe we've been shut down.
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:41.459]  People believe they can't go to M4 or store and that that money goes to the bad guys.
[02:24:41.559 --> 02:24:42.079]  No, it doesn't.
[02:24:42.959 --> 02:24:45.079]  But I'm not going to even try to convince people of that.
[02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:49.940]  I'm going to tell you that thealexjonesstore.com is not owned by me.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.000]  They have no claim to it.
[02:24:51.079 --> 02:24:57.639]  It has incredible supplements, great Patriot gear, limited edition Patriot posters, a memento that you really supported.
[02:24:57.639 --> 02:25:00.379]  So they have big markup on those, not the supplements, not the t-shirts.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:01.379]  They're very fair priced.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  I need funds.
[02:25:03.659 --> 02:25:06.000]  So please, you ask me to keep fighting.
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:10.120]  The only variable is you supporting me.
[02:25:12.189 --> 02:25:12.549]  Alright?
[02:25:12.549 --> 02:25:16.590]  Now we have the ultimate CMOS. Our CMOS is an incredible superfood.
[02:25:17.729 --> 02:25:19.129]  A lot of the great supplements there.
[02:25:19.370 --> 02:25:20.829]  There's not a lot of markup in those.
[02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:22.909]  But you're going to love them, you're going to order them again.
[02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:25.389]  But the posters do have huge markup.
[02:25:25.469 --> 02:25:26.629]  They cost like 6-7 bucks.
[02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:27.590]  They're 50 bucks.
[02:25:27.690 --> 02:25:29.090]  You get that, you're really supporting.
[02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:33.709]  So if you really want to support, go get one of the four limited edition posters.
[02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:37.750]  Some are 30, some are 40. The point is, we get real money for that.
[02:25:37.909 --> 02:25:39.889]  You hang it on the wall, you know you're in the fight.
[02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:41.969]  I mean, say what you can do.
[02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.950]  That's one of the big ones.
[02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:53.809]  Separately, my dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:56.549]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:57.989]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[02:25:58.069 --> 02:25:58.389]  Thank you, sir.
[02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:07.250]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:09.889]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:14.799]  My dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:26:14.979 --> 02:26:19.379]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:22.340]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:24.159]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[02:26:24.399 --> 02:26:26.420]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:29.139]  And we're finally winning.
[02:26:30.450 --> 02:26:43.530]  So, not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him, because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:26:43.530 --> 02:26:46.170]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[02:26:46.549 --> 02:26:55.209]  And then, personally, going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me, because that's how dads are.
[02:26:55.389 --> 02:26:56.729]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:26:57.569 --> 02:27:02.530]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:03.770]  And I got pissed.
[02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:13.389]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:27:13.829 --> 02:27:15.129]  The supplements are there.
[02:27:15.709 --> 02:27:16.409]  They're great.
[02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:18.250]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:19.170]  He's put everything into it.
[02:27:19.170 --> 02:27:19.610]  He has.
[02:27:19.729 --> 02:27:20.250]  They're incredible.
[02:27:21.709 --> 02:27:32.860]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, Because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:27:32.979 --> 02:27:34.159]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:37.639]  Please support us.
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:40.459]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.

[02:28:13.659 --> 02:28:14.559]  Turbo Force.
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.379]  Things like that that are popular.
[02:28:16.579 --> 02:28:19.059]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:28:19.809 --> 02:28:25.530]  And if the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down, my dad won't stop fighting.
[02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:26.290]  He's a fighter.
[02:28:26.409 --> 02:28:27.290]  Hell, he's my dad.
[02:28:27.709 --> 02:28:28.709]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:28:30.250 --> 02:28:31.629]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:40.860]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:44.000]  But at this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:45.579]  It's about my parents.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:51.659]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's why the enemy targeted them.
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:55.159]  So, please, support the info war today.
[02:28:55.319 --> 02:28:57.280]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:01.299]  I'm asking it personally for you to do it now.
[02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:05.190]  And if 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[02:29:05.329 --> 02:29:07.069]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:12.969]  But it's less than one half or 1% that ever buy anything from drjonesnaturals.com or thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:29:13.069 --> 02:29:17.090]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[02:29:17.530 --> 02:29:21.010]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:25.149]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour that I've got questions coming up for our guests.
[02:29:25.149 --> 02:29:28.489]  We're going to go ahead and just do the whole next hour with him and your calls.
[02:29:28.690 --> 02:29:31.329]  And I appreciate dark journalists coming on.
[02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:39.549]  We're good to go.
[02:29:49.890 --> 02:30:00.270]  We're good to go.
[02:30:10.289 --> 02:30:12.950]  State defense contractor, Aero Space Wing.
[02:30:13.069 --> 02:30:17.530]  And what he said years ago has now come out and is being admitted to in a limited hangout.
[02:30:17.629 --> 02:30:24.729]  Now we've got all these super sophisticated UFOs all over the bases, all over the flying around in Manhattan in a demonstration.
[02:30:24.809 --> 02:30:26.010]  How does this all tie together?
[02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:28.690]  Darkjournalist.com, YouTube, Dark Journalist.
[02:30:31.129 --> 02:30:38.129]  I'm going to give you the floor here, but give us a 35,000 foot view and then bring it in for people because your analysis, I think, is the best out there, Dark Journalist.
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:41.219]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:44.079]  And viva Infowars as well.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:47.780]  But it's an excellent point that there's so much going on right now.
[02:30:48.059 --> 02:30:54.280]  And your Ukraine coverage is really getting to the heart of the matter of just how serious the situation is pre-inauguration.
[02:30:54.799 --> 02:31:08.360]  And there's been a dedicated group involved, the continuity of government group, that's been at odds with the Trump administration since before he got in, in fact, and have been at odds at different times with different administrations.
[02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:13.079]  But slowly percolating up there in power centers throughout time.
[02:31:13.450 --> 02:31:30.229]  And it's very interesting to note that the continuity of government players, very often their people are involved when you get into these deep events in history, whether you can track it all the way back through Watergate, 9-11, the actions of Iran-Contra,
[02:31:30.430 --> 02:31:39.170]  and even the debacle of the financial coup d'etat of 2008, along with COVID, all have involved some very serious COG players.
[02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:40.829]  So they're right there in the heart of it.
[02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:44.129]  And they tend to stay in the background, so we don't know their names.
[02:31:44.290 --> 02:31:50.889]  And one of the things I like to do is really popularize who they are, who's running that, and exactly what kind of powers that they have.
[02:31:51.069 --> 02:31:58.329]  Because in fact, the COG commander has the ability to take over the United States under emergency power rule.
[02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:03.270]  Welcome to my show!
[02:32:06.090 --> 02:32:20.069]  Welcome to my show!
[02:32:20.930 --> 02:32:32.309]  It's very interesting because it piggybacks on an authentic program, which was to prevent this whole idea about the Russians bombing the United States back in the 50s.
[02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:36.969]  And they built a gigantic infrastructure underground during the Eisenhower administration.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:51.920]  And it's quite fascinating because the same thing that was going on above ground with the highway development across coast to coast in America, which really fueled the economy and caused this big boom in the 50s, there was a gigantic underground infrastructure counterpart.
[02:32:52.020 --> 02:33:01.780]  So we had all these COG bases built up in the event that there was going to be a decapitation of the United States government and this other government would have to take over.
[02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:06.229]  But after a while, it got very fuzzy and the oversight got very poor.
[02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:20.409]  And this group started to participate with more and more powers so that people who were key in certain deep events all the way from Dick Cheney to John Dean were all deeply, deeply involved with the continuity of government program.
[02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:24.950]  Continue breaking this down because this is so important.
[02:33:26.219 --> 02:33:27.700]  Well, here's what I see them doing.
[02:33:27.899 --> 02:33:30.340]  They've been positioning now very heavily.
[02:33:30.479 --> 02:33:37.079]  They just did a series of chemical attack running through these different missions.
[02:33:37.079 --> 02:33:41.399]  And what they were doing was basically doing these tests for a massive chemical attack.
[02:33:41.639 --> 02:33:45.559]  To me, that's a pretty bad sign for what they've been up to.
[02:33:45.899 --> 02:34:01.850]  And the thing about continuity of government that I think is little understood is that when the switch is thrown, And they used to be such a secret organization, but I can speak about this in such a way because even people like Nancy Pelosi talk about them publicly now.
[02:34:02.069 --> 02:34:06.229]  That's the kind of thing that should make you nervous when you realize the kind of powers that COG has.
[02:34:06.930 --> 02:34:10.829]  But when that switch is thrown, they assign regional governors.
[02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:17.350]  And through the regional governors, they have the NORTHCOM commander, and he gives the instructions, the regional governors take over.
[02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:22.649]  And then what happens when the regional governors take over is they say, well, we're gonna secure things until we can have an election.
[02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:44.899]  Well, with the unusual setup of the resignation of Biden from the campaign, but staying in as president, and then Trump winning the election, along with the alliance with Bobby and everything else, I think that things are very rife with the situation of COG coming in and taking a look at the surroundings and saying this is an ideal opportunity.
[02:34:45.319 --> 02:34:51.680]  And so we have this kind of period running here between now and the inauguration that gets us into very heavy territory.
[02:34:53.350 --> 02:35:02.809]  Right around the election period is all of these UFO swarms around nuclear bases, whether it's in the UK or in America.
[02:35:03.010 --> 02:35:11.270]  And at Langley, the story came out that Langley Air Force Base was harassed for 17 days by swarms of unknown drones.
[02:35:11.610 --> 02:35:13.950]  Now, that's a wartime condition.
[02:35:14.170 --> 02:35:18.969]  Who was operating those devices and how are they defined as drones?
[02:35:19.389 --> 02:35:24.190]  So this is all also simulated so that we're looking at it.
[02:35:24.290 --> 02:35:27.270]  And this is part of an operation where they can report this thing.
[02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:29.170]  Hey, you know, we're running it as a drill.
[02:35:29.389 --> 02:35:33.829]  But what's happening is they're reporting it for real in the Wall Street Journal, for example.
[02:35:34.049 --> 02:35:40.629]  And they went to go interview the COG commander in relation to this UFO swarm at the base in Langley.
[02:35:41.329 --> 02:35:45.409]  And they cited him, they talked about him, they called him General Van Herc.
[02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:47.209]  Well, he's the previous COG commander.
[02:35:47.430 --> 02:35:49.350]  The current commander is Gregory Guillo.
[02:35:50.010 --> 02:35:55.610]  And both of them, interestingly enough, have a UFO connection in their background in terms of the bases that they were at.
[02:35:56.639 --> 02:36:01.120]  So, for me, this was very odd because, I mean, I worked at the Wall Street Journal.
[02:36:01.239 --> 02:36:02.059]  They're very accurate.
[02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:07.319]  They're not gonna get the former COG commander to comment like he's the current COG commander.
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:15.520]  Now, that story came out early in November, but I thought that that was odd to start with because it is, in fact, Gio who is the COG commander.
[02:36:15.809 --> 02:36:26.469]  Now, they're having interviews with the COG commander, Gio, and he's talking about UAP, which is this code word that they've used for UFOs to try to rebrand the thing.
[02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:38.750]  And it's very fascinating because Gio, when he's talking about UAP, he got very nervous when he was speaking to Defense One, which is one of these military publications.
[02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:44.270]  And he actually ran out of the room when they were talking about UAP and said, I have something else to get to.
[02:36:44.799 --> 02:36:48.899]  So something very strange is going on with the swarm aspect.
[02:36:49.180 --> 02:37:01.879]  And then when we get to the whole thing about the swarms in the UK bases, this is outrageous because whenever you get around, you can't have objects in the air without NORAD knowing where they come from, what their origin is, what they are, etc.
[02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:06.010]  So there's no way that they don't know what the craft are that they're seeing.
[02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:15.049]  And if it was a genuine situation of kind of UFO invasion idea, then they would put everything on an alert status immediately.
[02:37:15.209 --> 02:37:18.950]  What they're doing is they're sort of testing the scenario out with the public.
[02:37:19.129 --> 02:37:26.590]  And it looks to me like the drone incursions are being caused by somebody inside of that structure as a drill to get public feedback.
[02:37:26.959 --> 02:37:37.379]  So it's a very dangerous situation because you have a genuine kind of UFO file aspect involved, but then you have this continuity of government sort of ginned up threats.
[02:37:37.719 --> 02:37:40.420]  And the UFO threat is what the UFO hearings were all about.
[02:37:40.639 --> 02:37:50.920]  They trotted out a bunch of CIA, NGA, NRO guys, and they were basically saying, oh, we know there's a threat out there, and we're going to get that government to give us that.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.200]  We've got these whistleblowers, and all the whistleblowers are all government people.
[02:37:54.299 --> 02:37:55.459]  They're not whistleblowers at all.
[02:37:55.559 --> 02:38:02.840]  They're all We're good to go.
[02:38:26.350 --> 02:38:28.430]  What is your analysis of why we're seeing this?
[02:38:29.309 --> 02:38:35.170]  Well, it's interesting because at the very beginning of that Russia-Ukraine war, there were weird signals.
[02:38:35.450 --> 02:38:37.010]  And one of those signals was very interesting.
[02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:46.729]  It was, we were looking at a plane, one of the most sophisticated planes that the Russians had going down in an area called Voronezh.
[02:38:47.219 --> 02:38:49.319]  And that was a big headline at the time.
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:55.340]  What's interesting, when I tracked back on Voronezh, it turned out it was the site of a major UFO landing.
[02:38:55.879 --> 02:38:57.280]  The whole public was out there.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.180]  The police chief of the region was out there.
[02:38:59.659 --> 02:39:05.100]  And that story went all the way back to 1989. It was carried here in America on Nightline.
[02:39:05.559 --> 02:39:08.139]  So Voronezh was instantly a weird signature.
[02:39:08.319 --> 02:39:15.899]  The other thing that was strange when the war started is that Ghislaine Maxwell from prison started to talk about Chernobyl.
[02:39:16.719 --> 02:39:20.860]  And this was another kind of strange piece that popped up here.
[02:39:20.959 --> 02:39:23.299]  It's like, why are we talking about Chernobyl all of a sudden?
[02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:34.819]  Well, then all of a sudden, early in the war, the Ukraine forces captured Chernobyl, and they have the Russians battling it out over Chernobyl, which was the site of this massive nuclear meltdown in the 1980s.
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:43.360]  So there were strange signals instantly, and that's how governments work when it gets to the UFO technology aspect, the advanced technology, the X technology.
[02:39:43.979 --> 02:39:47.920]  Which is they signal each other without coming right out and saying it.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.979]  At a certain point, there were headlines in Russia saying, we shot down UFOs over the Moscow airport.
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:57.180]  Well, that's a very strange headline coming out of there.
[02:39:57.299 --> 02:40:02.079]  But we did our own version of that in 2023 when we had the Chinese balloon stuff.
[02:40:03.059 --> 02:40:04.819]  These were very unusual things.
[02:40:04.979 --> 02:40:08.579]  They're testing the public on what happens if you have a threat from above.
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:20.840]  And so when you get into that whole aspect around the World War aspect that we're coming into around a genuine nuclear threat, probably nothing like it since the Cuban Missile Crisis, in fact.
[02:40:22.319 --> 02:40:27.600]  And we're looking at this alliance of Trump and Kennedy coming into office.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:38.600]  We're getting a lot of very strange push-pull when you look at the kind of design of history and where we are now with this, which is the same sort of clash that took place back there during the Kennedy era.
[02:40:38.879 --> 02:40:39.799]  Is still with us.
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:42.579]  It was never in fact resolved over those 60 years.
[02:40:42.739 --> 02:40:56.100]  And you have the same deep state operation and the same battle over this advanced technology going on very deep inside the government to a level where it's very difficult for any normal reporter to get their hands on it.
[02:40:56.159 --> 02:40:57.840]  It's funny about the UFO hearings.
[02:40:58.180 --> 02:41:03.440]  Because we had this guy Schellenberger out there, and he was playing the journalist part.
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:06.440]  And he said, you know, I only got interested in UFOs last year.
[02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:10.520]  And all of a sudden, 12 CIA guys came to me, and they had all this info for me.
[02:41:10.819 --> 02:41:13.379]  And then they have him up there as their spokesman.
[02:41:13.379 --> 02:41:14.780]  And he said, oh, I found this program.
[02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:19.440]  It's called Immaculate Constellation, and it's all about what we're doing for crash retrievals.
[02:41:19.719 --> 02:41:21.700]  Well, the program doesn't even exist.
[02:41:21.979 --> 02:41:25.379]  They gave him a lot of fluff, and they made the whole hearings out of it.
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:28.760]  So you have all these people like Congressman Burchett and so on.
[02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:31.459]  They genuinely probably want to get somewhere on the subject.
[02:41:31.559 --> 02:41:37.180]  And they're questioning these people who are getting third-hand advice from NRO, NSA people.
[02:41:37.479 --> 02:41:40.920]  So you're not gonna get the truth from any of the UFO hearings, unfortunately.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:51.319]  And we've had people out there like Nancy Mace and Anna Luna and these other people who've been trying to get some kind of answers, but they don't know a great deal about the topic.
[02:41:51.399 --> 02:41:54.180]  And that's part of the problem, which they've kept them in the dark.
[02:41:54.399 --> 02:41:59.600]  And when they've been given briefings and things along that line, they're not able to make notes.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:03.760]  If you go into some of the people who've been on those meetings, they say they treat us like a six-year-old.
[02:42:06.459 --> 02:42:13.020]  We're good to go.
[02:42:25.210 --> 02:42:27.450]  And they've talked about national emergencies.
[02:42:27.450 --> 02:42:28.909]  They've talked about civil war conditions.
[02:42:28.909 --> 02:42:33.510]  If he does win, 54 days out, it's clear they're planning something big.
[02:42:33.649 --> 02:42:38.389]  They're claiming white supremacists that we always learn are run by the feds, are going to knock out the power grid.
[02:42:38.530 --> 02:42:39.250]  So they do it.
[02:42:39.409 --> 02:42:40.069]  Blame the Russians.
[02:42:40.229 --> 02:42:40.709]  Blame Trump.
[02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:42.770]  Say white supremacists work for Trump.
[02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:44.510]  They've already pre-programmed that clearly.
[02:42:44.809 --> 02:42:46.809]  Big false flags against migrants.
[02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:52.530]  And then we have mayors saying they're going to physically resist ICE. Clearly they're trying to set that up as well.
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:58.379]  Seeing all the COG activity, looking at the tea leaves, what do you see unfolding?
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:05.559]  Well, one of the main things I think that they can use is the UFO threat aspect.
[02:43:05.819 --> 02:43:09.780]  Now they do have other aspects where they could call in COG cyber attacks.
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.700]  The things that you're talking about on the nuclear side, certainly a nuclear warning would do it.
[02:43:14.799 --> 02:43:21.219]  But then the nuclear thing gets very messy unless you're using rod of God technology and some of the things that they haven't let out yet.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:27.399]  Like we've done some reports on this ripple technology that's classified even now, even though it's been around 60 years.
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:33.059]  And that ripple technology lets off a nuclear catastrophe, but it doesn't have any fallout.
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:38.440]  So it has a kind of a clean burn where it destroys things, but they're still able to use it after the fact.
[02:43:39.250 --> 02:43:42.969]  So the Rod of God technology also gets us into a weird place.
[02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:47.270]  And this is the kind of thing where they don't want to disclose everything that they have.
[02:43:47.430 --> 02:43:59.469]  But we know about the Rod of God technology because that also has this ripple type effect where it goes into a particular area, decimates it like a nuclear explosion, but it doesn't have any of the fallout that's involved.
[02:43:59.790 --> 02:44:20.670]  So those advanced weapons, I hope to never see them used, but we see in the conflict with what's going on with NATO forcing themselves in there and really at the very end of the Biden administration trying to ramp this up and ratchet it up into World War III. It creates a perfect scenario for the continuity of government players.
[02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:35.950]  Now, if you see anything, you know, as soon as the election kicked in, if you get a UFO hearing a week after the election, and then you have all of these drone swarms, quote unquote, in Langley Air Force Base in the United States, you're having a drone swarm.
[02:44:36.209 --> 02:44:37.270]  I mean, that is unheard of.
[02:44:37.569 --> 02:44:40.530]  But now we're seeing it in US bases overseas.
[02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:42.590]  Stay there, stay there, Daniel.
[02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:45.950]  Daniel List, darkjournalist, darkjournalist.com.
[02:44:46.069 --> 02:44:46.549]  Stay right there.
[02:44:46.649 --> 02:44:47.190]  I want to come back.
[02:44:47.309 --> 02:45:00.309]  And people that don't know about D.U. Sabo's Tungsten, Rods of God, Smart Pebble, X-Ray Lasers, Clean Hydrogen Bombs, Ripple Effects.
[02:45:01.049 --> 02:45:01.850]  Neutron bombs.
[02:45:02.309 --> 02:45:05.010]  We'll talk about all this, take calls, and more.
[02:45:05.170 --> 02:45:06.409]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:45:06.690 --> 02:45:21.930]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[02:45:22.170 --> 02:45:27.469]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid.
[02:45:28.270 --> 02:45:31.350]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:35.709]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[02:45:35.889 --> 02:45:36.370]  Who knows?
[02:45:36.930 --> 02:45:39.329]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:53.989]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[02:45:54.459 --> 02:45:58.399]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[02:45:58.540 --> 02:46:11.139]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:12.819]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:27.559]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at theologyofthestore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[02:46:27.959 --> 02:46:31.780]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[02:46:31.879 --> 02:46:33.139]  But that's going to get announced.
[02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:35.340]  The winner here in just a few days.
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:39.520]  And regardless of whether Infowars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:41.159]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:43.020]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:44.159]  So now...
[02:46:44.489 --> 02:46:52.190]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:52.549 --> 02:46:58.090]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[02:46:58.250 --> 02:46:59.549]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[02:46:59.709 --> 02:47:00.690]  It's a beautiful truck.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:17.239]  We're good to go.
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:49.120]  We're good to go.
[02:47:49.869 --> 02:47:51.969]  And here is the amazing new offer.
[02:48:18.690 --> 02:48:21.350]  The transmission on the air.
[02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:23.010]  We are so excited about it.
[02:48:23.170 --> 02:48:30.930]  Check out all the great supplements, all the great patriot apparel, limited edition knives, and so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:54.829]  It's so exciting to see the big win with Trump.
[02:48:55.110 --> 02:49:00.489]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:01.649]  God bless you all.
[02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:02.809]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:49:03.069 --> 02:49:05.870]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:06.739 --> 02:49:09.479]  For the rest of the hour, your calls are coming up with a bunch of other news.
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:14.340]  Dark Journalist, one of the most informed people out there, joins us.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.719]  And he's going right to what we know they have.
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:19.219]  A lot of this has been declassified.
[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:21.860]  A lot of it's 40, 50, 60, 70 years old.
[02:49:22.219 --> 02:49:25.479]  The Nazis developed a lot of it, got perfected by the United States.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.200]  And so I think you can extrapolate it.
[02:49:28.299 --> 02:49:31.260]  You see the arrogance of the Pentagon and Lloyd Austin and the rest of them.
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:33.440]  We're not worried about nuclear war with Russia.
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:35.979]  NATO, we might go ahead and just sneak attack them.
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.479]  Yeah, we might just have our armies attack right now.
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:39.780]  Go ahead, Russia.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:40.879]  Go ahead, Russia.
[02:49:41.059 --> 02:49:41.600]  Do something.
[02:49:41.739 --> 02:49:42.120]  Do something.
[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:49.680]  It's not speculation, dark journalists in my views, Daniel, that NATO is trying to go into a hot nuclear war right now.
[02:49:49.979 --> 02:49:51.200]  What's your view on that?
[02:49:51.579 --> 02:49:53.799]  And then just give us a 35,000 foot view.
[02:49:53.899 --> 02:49:55.340]  Some stations don't carry this five minutes.
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:09.479]  We'll come back after this short break and address all of it and take calls and Go deeper into this, but what do you think's really, because I know you don't like to speculate a lot, but just as a person, as an individual having a lot of knowledge, do you agree with the statement I just made?
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:12.079]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:25.379]  It's interesting, too, when you get around the whole Russian aspect because Russia has their own UFO file development, their own secret technology program that's right up there with ours, if not even beyond it.
[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:29.440]  And there's been a lot of nuclear brinkmanship back and forth on that.
[02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:43.989]  They know also that there's a blackmail aspect involved because they, from every deep event in United States history, from the moon landings, To the Kennedy assassination, I think we went to the moon by the way, but they know a lot more about what happened there.
[02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:49.129]  They have kind of their own records of 9-11.
[02:50:49.350 --> 02:50:53.750]  They have their own records of what took place with the COVID off and other things.
[02:50:54.090 --> 02:50:58.530]  So there's a cat and mouse game that goes back and forth on the UFO file technology.
[02:50:58.809 --> 02:51:02.049]  The way that that works is Russia has their own redevelopment program.
[02:51:02.290 --> 02:51:03.629]  They've reached a certain level.
[02:51:03.809 --> 02:51:16.719]  And so at times when we roll things out, they get a sense to We're good to go.
[02:51:24.799 --> 02:51:29.639]  During Reykjavik and said, look, we have this whole UFO swarms around.
[02:51:29.739 --> 02:51:33.059]  Will you work with us to fight off a UFO threat?
[02:51:33.219 --> 02:51:35.180]  And Gorbachev said he was totally serious.
[02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:42.340]  Now, Gorbachev went on the record with that in front of all these national security people like George Shultz and the late Henry Kissinger and others.
[02:51:43.379 --> 02:51:48.649]  But this is a gigantic Thing for them to admit that this has been working all along.
[02:51:48.930 --> 02:51:58.969]  So whenever we get around this Russia-America clash, it has that signature because JFK and Khrushchev, for example, they wanted to get together.
[02:51:59.110 --> 02:52:01.250]  They said, we don't want the translator with us.
[02:52:01.889 --> 02:52:04.329]  We basically want to do this one on one.
[02:52:04.510 --> 02:52:06.030]  We don't want any State Department officials.
[02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:10.209]  We don't want any of it because they want to get at the UFO file conversation.
[02:52:10.989 --> 02:52:12.610]  Reagan and Gorbachev, same thing.
[02:52:12.770 --> 02:52:13.870]  Just the translator, please.
[02:52:14.110 --> 02:52:16.030]  No State Department people, nothing.
[02:52:16.629 --> 02:52:23.090]  Trump and Putin, how many efforts were made to keep Trump and Putin away from each other by calling Trump a Putin puppet?
[02:52:23.469 --> 02:52:32.409]  So if they get in there and they discuss the UFO file between themselves, it cuts out the loop of the middlemen, the expert tech group that's managing all this.
[02:52:32.639 --> 02:52:33.959]  This is the nature of the problem.
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:36.680]  It's a completely secret technology program.
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:45.440]  And the little breadcrumbs that they roll out in the congressional hearings are just to condition us to, because at a certain point they've been developing this stuff in the background.
[02:52:45.719 --> 02:52:51.979]  As they roll it out in their control system, they need us to get on board with what they've been doing for the past 80 years.
[02:52:52.219 --> 02:52:59.000]  I mean, it's kind of hilarious when you think about the fact that we haven't gone to the moon since 1972. I mean, how absurd is that?
[02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:01.020]  Suddenly we have a program that's gonna go back to the moon.
[02:53:01.809 --> 02:53:08.329]  Artemis, you know, we've been cut out of the loop and a secret space program has been developed in the background during that whole period.
[02:53:08.969 --> 02:53:11.069]  That's the infrastructure that's in place.
[02:53:11.270 --> 02:53:13.069]  And Elon Musk is a giant part of this.
[02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:15.229]  Let's talk about him and get your expertise on that.
[02:53:15.690 --> 02:53:16.809]  Daniel knows what he's talking about.
[02:53:17.129 --> 02:53:18.510]  Darkjournalist, darkjournalist.com.
[02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:20.069]  And I know callers are there.
[02:53:20.170 --> 02:53:21.829]  I'll get to at least everybody that's on hold right now.
[02:53:22.329 --> 02:53:24.129]  We will get to you coming up.
[02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:24.850]  Stay with us.
[02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:29.610]  This is vital information on November 26, 2024. Well, look...
[02:53:30.350 --> 02:53:39.370]  The different elite groups of the planet are very public about disruptive technologies, whether we had a real Atlantis or not that blew itself up with some free energy system.
[02:53:39.829 --> 02:53:47.649]  We are at that Atlantean moment now where we could easily destroy ourselves and most of the different studies of it say we probably will.
[02:53:48.590 --> 02:53:50.729]  That's why it must is we've got to get off world immediately.
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:54.739]  And then Neil deGrasse Tyson says, well, save this Earth.
[02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:56.079]  Well, yeah.
[02:53:56.639 --> 02:54:01.020]  But just in case, we better become a type 1 civilization that's not dependent on one planet.
[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:03.780]  Plus, we're trailblazers.
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.500]  We're mavericks.
[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:06.299]  We're explorers.
[02:54:06.420 --> 02:54:07.399]  This is what we're supposed to do.
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:11.389]  But It's not big business.
[02:54:11.389 --> 02:54:19.409]  It's everything that the establishment wants to keep the people in the dark about knowledge, about history, about technology, about life extension systems.
[02:54:19.729 --> 02:54:24.250]  And they admitted 30 years ago that they had animal-human cross-species clones.
[02:54:24.649 --> 02:54:34.489]  And then 15 years ago, MIT Quarterly, oh, there's humanoids chest-dating inside cows at laboratories across the United States.
[02:54:34.569 --> 02:54:37.450]  Now, yeah, we got these humanoid creatures, but we don't really show them to you.
[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:47.120]  So there's that point of them admitting all this, this breakaway civilization, or competing, breakaway corporate governmental systems.
[02:54:47.399 --> 02:55:03.639]  And so I would ask Dark Journalist, who's an expert on this, how would you break down the different power blocks, how many are there, and subgroups, and what is the dominant group, and what is their goal?
[02:55:03.719 --> 02:55:08.399]  Because on the surface, It looks like Russia has a pro-human vision.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:11.979]  Elon Musk has a pro-human vision, though still somewhat transhumanist.
[02:55:12.219 --> 02:55:15.420]  That's going to happen, so let's just open source it and be honest about it.
[02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:16.440]  And it's really dangerous.
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:17.440]  We better spread it out.
[02:55:18.270 --> 02:55:28.790]  And then those that just want us playing video games and taking psychotropics and quietly being phased out and dying, that's the main Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Bill Joy admitted plan, the future doesn't need us.
[02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:30.049]  The future's not human.
[02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:40.370]  And then the CHICOMs, a project of the globalists, but 14 years ago, they broke off and are doing their own thing, but still integrated to a certain level of the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:55:40.549 --> 02:55:41.069]  I mean, is that a...
[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:43.059]  Kind of a quick gestalt of it.
[02:55:43.219 --> 02:55:47.000]  And then how does Elon Musk and Donald Trump as players fit in?
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:48.959]  What camp would you say they're in?
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:52.379]  Because we know Trump's uncle really was a top Tesla guy.
[02:55:52.559 --> 02:55:57.579]  And Trump knows about, obviously, he's got inside baseball, at least in some of the breakaway groups.
[02:55:57.899 --> 02:56:02.959]  Now, there's a breakaway group that says, let's just admit it.
[02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:08.909]  And let people know, which I would think that's the obvious best plan.
[02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:12.450]  Full disclosure, that's a lot.
[02:56:12.450 --> 02:56:13.870]  How would you unpack that, dark journalist?
[02:56:15.270 --> 02:56:18.989]  Well, that is exactly what we're up against right now.
[02:56:19.010 --> 02:56:22.590]  You have outlined it very well, and I'll tell you what's interesting, too.
[02:56:22.729 --> 02:56:27.809]  When you talk about Musk, you know, Musk has done a lot of good things and opened up a lot of things.
[02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:34.930]  That's what he's been doing since he, especially since the assassination attempt, On President Trump, there's no question about it.
[02:56:35.610 --> 02:56:41.270]  But one of the interesting things is that he won't talk about the UFO file, but he knows a great deal about it.
[02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:50.129]  And because of where the situation that he's in and the dependencies and the cross dependencies he has with other groups, especially dealing with space.
[02:56:50.129 --> 02:56:57.729]  When you get up there, you have to play ball because that's an infrastructure that the government has laid out long before the privatization kicked in.
[02:56:58.590 --> 02:57:00.750]  And you have other guys who are like that too.
[02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:03.329]  For example, Bigelow Aerospace, Robert Bigelow.
[02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:07.829]  He went on 60 Minutes and said, oh yeah, I know UFOs have been here.
[02:57:07.950 --> 02:57:09.610]  So many of these guys are clued in.
[02:57:09.690 --> 02:57:13.549]  But Musk is the one with SpaceX who can't say anything about it.
[02:57:13.610 --> 02:57:15.329]  He knows a great deal about the UFO file.
[02:57:15.370 --> 02:57:17.690]  And I've had that direct from people inside.
[02:57:18.530 --> 02:57:20.250]  And notice he won't talk about it.
[02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:21.489]  And then let me just add a caveat.
[02:57:21.690 --> 02:57:22.309]  We can play these.
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:28.860]  Different Apollo missions, and these are real NASA tapes since we put out on TV. We're like, yep, we're being followed by it.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:29.860]  We're being followed by an orb.
[02:57:29.979 --> 02:57:31.299]  We're being followed by a saucer.
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:33.299]  And it's behind us now.
[02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:33.959]  It just sped off.
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:34.819]  Now it just came back.
[02:57:34.979 --> 02:57:36.799]  I mean, that went on.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:40.479]  And by the way, I knew people on mission control who were Christian, who I knew well.
[02:57:40.559 --> 02:57:42.700]  I was good friends with Raymond Teague, died about five, six years ago.
[02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:46.139]  He was the guy running the RCA cameras on the moon.
[02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:49.149]  And he said, no, we were there.
[02:57:49.370 --> 02:57:52.729]  He had national security letters on the wall, presidential awards.
[02:57:53.229 --> 02:57:59.270]  He got, I mean, presidential medals from presidents for running the cameras.
[02:57:59.270 --> 02:58:01.770]  And he said, listen, I can't tell you, Alex.
[02:58:01.850 --> 02:58:04.129]  He said, there was other stuff, though.
[02:58:04.309 --> 02:58:10.729]  He said, and that's the point, was we were just the public face of something much bigger.
[02:58:10.809 --> 02:58:12.629]  And they admit, what, 90% of the space program is military.
[02:58:12.629 --> 02:58:12.989]  Go ahead.
[02:58:14.139 --> 02:58:14.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:58:15.319 --> 02:58:30.520]  And there's a battle very early on with Kennedy over Blue Gemini and NASA where he goes and basically sends Robert McNamara to threaten them and say, look, if you develop this thing as a secret program, I'm gonna kick it back to the military because at least I know they'll report to me.
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:31.860]  I don't know what you're doing here.
[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:46.700]  And so that whole thing and the whole program, which is actually called Blue on the inside, And it's funny because when I released that last year, they flipped out in that structure and they came out this year, very early this year and said, well, yeah, we had Blue.
[02:58:46.920 --> 02:58:47.299]  It's true.
[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:51.399]  We did have a program called Blue, but it was set up for crash retrievals.
[02:58:51.559 --> 02:58:52.239]  We just did that.
[02:58:52.299 --> 02:58:52.959]  It was an exercise.
[02:58:53.100 --> 02:58:54.739]  It had nothing to do and it didn't recover anything.
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:59:04.979]  In fact, Kona Blue, which was that program, they had set up based over the actual crashes of UFOs and the redevelopment of that here.
[02:59:05.559 --> 02:59:15.739]  And Kona, by the way, the code for Kona was very interesting because it was Kingman, which was the Arizona crash, Ossining, which is where all the redevelopment took place.
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:31.340]  N was for Nellis, and A was Aztec, which was the crash that happened in 1948. So that whole Kona Blue thing that came out, we had announced it a year earlier because inside that structure, they call the program Blue.
[02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:42.090]  So there's a number of reasons for that, but it's important to note when they put out these false names, like Immaculate Constellation, which they just dream up and they shove these guys before Congress.
[02:59:42.250 --> 02:59:46.129]  And he's like, I'm dealing with Immaculate Constellation whistleblowers.
[02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:52.010]  And when you really drill down on it, all the people that he's talking to are all NRO or NSA people.
[02:59:52.209 --> 02:59:56.649]  And then we see subgroups of it kind of winking, winking with the big AI program.
[02:59:57.229 --> 03:00:03.110]  Deep blue and with the little, you know, private space thing, blue origin.
[03:00:03.510 --> 03:00:05.049]  Yes, exactly.
[03:00:05.719 --> 03:00:11.440]  And Blue Origin is key because he wanted to be baptized to be the king of space instead of Elon.
[03:00:11.739 --> 03:00:17.059]  And this is where they crisscrossed with him, with Bezos, and they said, no, you have to kind of stay in your lane.
[03:00:17.159 --> 03:00:22.899]  You can run food, you can run Amazon, you can do this other stuff, but you're not getting the big blessing on the space side.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:24.100]  We're still going with SpaceX.
[03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:36.479]  Bigelow is another competitor in that front, but the problem is with Bigelow is he has a tendency Working out of Las Vegas and all the rest of it to really say what's on his mind.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:38.299]  And so they don't wanna work with him on that.
[03:00:38.879 --> 03:00:40.040]  But it's very interesting.
[03:00:40.219 --> 03:00:44.040]  If you look, talking about Trump and Elon, now here's another factor that's key.
[03:00:44.219 --> 03:00:49.360]  When you see Trump out there with the SpaceX launches in Texas, what does that remind you of?
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:58.260]  When I look at it, I see Kennedy and Von Braun looking up there shortly before Kennedy was assassinated and watching the takeoff of this whole thing.
[03:00:58.700 --> 03:01:14.959]  And it's very interesting because I think with SpaceX, it is the same agenda which they created this Whole privatization of space created the infrastructure for a space program out there, didn't tell the public about it, cut the public out for 52 years.
[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:20.840]  Now they want to introduce them back, but they have it privatized so it's no longer traced to a government entity.
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:27.260]  So the government doesn't have to be accountable and say, well, here's all, you've been able to get a FOIA request and what we've done in space.
[03:01:27.479 --> 03:01:31.200]  So it's certainly a secret space program and they've invited Elon in.
[03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:34.200]  He's kind of the good character that they need for this.
[03:01:34.399 --> 03:01:41.879]  And what's interesting for me when I look at Trump, the people that he selected for the cabinet have such a UFO signature, it's over the top.
[03:01:42.399 --> 03:01:55.020]  Especially John Ratcliffe, who I think is the guy who's going into CIA, has said some of the most provocative things about the UFO file of any public official, including the fact that they have abilities that we just have no idea.
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:02:01.000]  Where those types of abilities come from, and we don't know any country that could sponsor it.
[03:02:01.139 --> 03:02:06.260]  So he's implicating immediately that there's an off-world aspect to this.
[03:02:06.379 --> 03:02:09.219]  And it could very well be true, but not necessarily.
[03:02:09.399 --> 03:02:14.459]  There could be a group here that picked up the technology and developed it.
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:19.579]  And so when we get to this breakaway idea, we're talking half government and half something else.
[03:02:19.700 --> 03:02:28.680]  So it resides not in any particular government or any corporate structure, but somewhere between the two in a kind of shadowy aerospace intelligence corridor.
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:36.920]  Factions, let's look at the Anglo-American power, main globalist power group.
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:38.020]  How many factions?
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:45.819]  Well, I think one of the things that you pointed out there about the different groups, some of them want to share things.
[03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:48.819]  So I've split up those into two main groups.
[03:02:49.059 --> 03:02:53.299]  X Protect is the group that has a lethal secrecy aspect.
[03:02:53.639 --> 03:02:58.879]  They destroy reputations, they knock stories out, they take out real whistleblowers and all the rest.
[03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:03.700]  And the X Share group goes all the way back to Thomas Townsend Brown.
[03:03:05.739 --> 03:03:07.139]  I think?
[03:03:24.959 --> 03:03:30.860]  And she gave me some very first-hand intimations about what Townsend Brown was up to.
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:45.139]  And the fact that when he was working on certain projects, he would get threatened by this Ex-Protect group and he would take the family off to Eleuthera there in the Bahamas and be surrounded by machine guns for a while until this Ex-Protect wave kind of calmed down.
[03:03:45.379 --> 03:03:49.100]  That's the nature of what's going on in that battle there.
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:50.959]  And I would say the Ex-Share group is much smaller.
[03:03:51.649 --> 03:03:54.530]  The expert tech group is wide ranging.
[03:03:54.809 --> 03:04:08.870]  And I think that there's a kind of middle management group between them that just kind of keeps the peace and keeps things moving out and keeps the National Defense Authorization Act moving forward and the money flowing for the- That's very astute.
[03:04:09.049 --> 03:04:10.829]  I always describe the globalist model.
[03:04:11.639 --> 03:04:16.639]  And it's caught by everybody else as like a nuclear, old-fashioned nuclear power plant control thing or a space shuttle controls.
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:18.360]  Thousands of switches.
[03:04:18.860 --> 03:04:22.079]  And they see different political movements, organizations, and groups.
[03:04:22.180 --> 03:04:25.680]  And they build one up when they want it to be stronger to do something to another group.
[03:04:25.899 --> 03:04:30.159]  And it's a symphony of all of that going on.
[03:04:31.940 --> 03:04:33.520]  It is, and it's interesting.
[03:04:33.639 --> 03:04:39.100]  At the most secret point, they're very well aware of something you mentioned, which is older technology.
[03:04:40.709 --> 03:04:48.829]  And the whole thing about the Atlantean technology, the things that we talk about in that arena, well, I'll tell you how real this is.
[03:04:49.270 --> 03:05:03.110]  The CIA commissioned, I have the file, they commissioned a study and they planted people inside of Edgar Cayce's ARE organization to find out how real the Hall of Records and Two Eyes Stone technology was.
[03:05:03.290 --> 03:05:08.569]  They placed them in there, they have a record of it, because they wanted the inside from the Cayce Foundation.
[03:05:08.850 --> 03:05:12.770]  And you know, the Cayce Foundation, they're holistic people, they're into holistic health and anything.
[03:05:12.989 --> 03:05:18.010]  But Cayce has all these dramatic readings about the Atlantean technology that just go off the charts.
[03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:27.829]  And he talks all about this two-eye stone technology, which was a power grid that we had at a certain point and they tuned it too high and it pulled down massive land masses.
[03:05:28.329 --> 03:05:35.610]  And there's no question that they're concerned about the same type of thing happening and reengaging that whole technology wave.
[03:05:35.770 --> 03:05:37.649]  And we have the poles moving.
[03:05:39.709 --> 03:05:41.750]  Yes, there's the whole thing about the pole shift.
[03:05:41.930 --> 03:05:44.569]  What's fascinating is they have to position themselves.
[03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:46.329]  They're aware of the Earth changes.
[03:05:46.329 --> 03:05:47.250]  There's no question.
[03:05:47.370 --> 03:05:49.469]  They're so far advanced on this.
[03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:51.790]  We think about the technology that's coming.
[03:05:52.010 --> 03:06:02.270]  I can show you a report, 1976, on artificial intelligence that all the things that we're talking about in relation to artificial intelligence now, that's 50 years ago.
[03:06:03.010 --> 03:06:12.129]  I mean, the Intergalactic Communications System is a CIA-DARPA psychology plan for the internet, and it basically describes where we are now.
[03:06:12.290 --> 03:06:13.829]  So theoretically, it's amazing.
[03:06:15.319 --> 03:06:16.159]  And it's very interesting.
[03:06:16.159 --> 03:06:24.020]  You talked about longevity there as well, which is something they have this whole program about being immortal in that sense.
[03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:36.700]  Well, if you go back, that's very old because Cagliostro in the old Masonic tradition, the Philosopher's Stone, the whole idea was the Philosopher's Stone could make you live 5,527 years.
[03:06:37.739 --> 03:06:39.700]  So they're going very deep.
[03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:46.819]  And it's funny because when you look at the secrecy program around the UFO file, they use Masonic secrecy rules that are involved there.
[03:06:47.059 --> 03:07:01.159]  When they had Vandiver Bush running the UFO file, he was the MIT master of the Masonic Lodge for MIT. And his very interesting protege was Professor John Trump.
[03:07:01.639 --> 03:07:06.200]  So that's how we get that whole Trump thing in the background with Tesla, as he sends them in.
[03:07:06.360 --> 03:07:09.280]  They go and say, who can we handle this very secret stuff?
[03:07:09.500 --> 03:07:15.020]  And it's actually Vannevar Bush who runs the UFO file, who sends Professor John Trump in.
[03:07:15.180 --> 03:07:16.940]  So that's the crisscross in history.
[03:07:17.079 --> 03:07:19.299]  You see, a lot of people have it wrong with Trump.
[03:07:19.459 --> 03:07:26.420]  They think, here's this loudmouthed political guy who was a real estate developer and a big shot, and that's why everybody hates him.
[03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:32.239]  Well, you don't have to peel people off the ceiling when you mention Trump, when you get into these certain circles.
[03:07:32.399 --> 03:07:37.360]  There's some thing, it's sort of like he knows where the bodies are buried in that deep state structure.
[03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:38.659]  This is the problem.
[03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:42.260]  His uncle was entree to the UFO technology.
[03:07:42.479 --> 03:07:44.940]  There's no question in my mind that John Trump had that.
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:58.760]  And if he's working in 43 with the Tesla information and Vandiver Bush, who's in charge of the UFO file, is sending him in, then we know that Trump has an entree into that advanced technology world.
[03:07:58.959 --> 03:07:59.840]  That's a problem.
[03:07:59.979 --> 03:08:01.500]  That's where you get Space Force from.
[03:08:01.739 --> 03:08:12.020]  Space Force is an attempt by the executive branch to move that UFO file, which got out of the hands of the government of the executive branch in the 50s.
[03:08:12.869 --> 03:08:16.389]  They, you know, continual attempts to bring it back under executive control.
[03:08:16.569 --> 03:08:19.629]  Space Force was the one that Trump did, and he got away with it.
[03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:21.409]  It's an amazing accomplishment.
[03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.930]  Absolutely.
[03:08:21.930 --> 03:08:31.729]  I want to go to calls here soon, because they've been holding Dale, George, Nick, Stephen, Robert, Will, Mike on World War III, and get your take on that.
[03:08:32.129 --> 03:08:48.049]  But just in general, are you expecting, as we see a major buildup, If it continues accelerating with just more flaunting of the secret technology now in a month than we used to see in 10 years, if this trajectory of amplification continues,
[03:08:48.610 --> 03:08:52.590]  are we going to see something close to massive disclosure soon?
[03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:53.989]  Or fake disclosure?
[03:08:55.549 --> 03:08:56.530]  There's no question.
[03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:58.129]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[03:08:58.290 --> 03:09:00.049]  They're riding parallel side by side.
[03:09:00.370 --> 03:09:01.829]  Here's the thing about the UFO file.
[03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:10.069]  They realize that they're getting to a point where the UFO file is coming out, and they need to keep that secrecy on it.
[03:09:10.149 --> 03:09:11.729]  So they need their own story about it.
[03:09:11.850 --> 03:09:21.350]  So this breakaway group, they need to break back in with the technology and say, we've been developing this thing for 80 years in the background, but how are we going to explain this to the public?
[03:09:21.770 --> 03:09:25.690]  So now they have this story, we're being under attack.
[03:09:25.850 --> 03:09:26.750]  There's a UFO threat.
[03:09:27.010 --> 03:09:28.430]  They don't talk about being.
[03:09:28.809 --> 03:09:38.209]  This is interesting because if you go into the original physicist who disclosed this, and he was on the level of like Oppenheimer, and he said, I worked on the UFO file.
[03:09:39.129 --> 03:09:41.549]  We examined bodies that were in there.
[03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:44.590]  The bodies, they were constructed, they were like insects.
[03:09:44.709 --> 03:09:45.670]  Somebody had made them.
[03:09:45.870 --> 03:09:48.870]  So he was suggesting they were basically androids that were in there.
[03:09:49.610 --> 03:09:51.510]  And he went on record with the whole thing.
[03:09:51.629 --> 03:09:52.690]  Gets wiped out of history.
[03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:54.790]  You can't even find a Wikipedia page on this guy.
[03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:56.989]  Robert Sarbarker is his name.
[03:09:57.389 --> 03:09:59.889]  And he was on the cover of Time magazine.
[03:09:59.889 --> 03:10:01.549]  He was on all this stuff in the 50s.
[03:10:01.629 --> 03:10:06.350]  He blabs this stuff out in the 80s, and then they just kind of wipe him off the boards.
[03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:09.909]  But he worked directly with the UFO file and the redevelopment program.
[03:10:10.190 --> 03:10:13.790]  So that program operates on one level on the Russian side.
[03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:17.440]  And when you hear them saying, look, We have these hypersonic missiles.
[03:10:17.659 --> 03:10:20.459]  Nothing can defend against them and all the rest.
[03:10:20.659 --> 03:10:26.479]  That's a direct shot across the bow saying, we know you have the UFO thing, but we have this.
[03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:36.780]  And it's very interesting because if you look at the meetings that we've had on a presidential level, one of them that I think is very interesting, and I think this happened with Putin and Trump also.
[03:10:37.379 --> 03:10:44.500]  But when Reagan meets with Gorbachev at a certain point, they come out and say, we want to have zero nuclear weapons.
[03:10:44.979 --> 03:10:48.219]  Well, how do you go to zero nuclear weapons unless you have something else?
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:54.719]  And it's the something else that is haunting the geopolitical sphere because the public doesn't know what the something else is.
[03:10:55.239 --> 03:11:01.920]  Once in a while, we get a hint with the UFO file, with the UFO technology, that this is the unknown factor.
[03:11:02.159 --> 03:11:10.489]  The fact that the government wants to openly talk about it means they're at a point where they think that they can fake An alien invasion.
[03:11:10.809 --> 03:11:11.329]  There's no question.
[03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:12.850]  Or create an alien threat.
[03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:16.649]  They already have an office now, Arrow, which is basically a UFO defense office.
[03:11:16.969 --> 03:11:22.590]  That's going to breed billions and billions of dollars and is just more and more cover for the genuine thing.
[03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:30.750]  And the UN in the past has said they could use a threat of asteroids to build a world government to have the planetary defense, or they could just use both or the UFOs.
[03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:33.870]  There's no question about it.
[03:11:33.969 --> 03:11:41.290]  And the asteroid thing is interesting because Medvedev made some interesting comments saying basically we know how to aim it.
[03:11:41.850 --> 03:11:43.610]  So they know how to aim these asteroids.
[03:11:43.809 --> 03:11:50.190]  So there was an asteroid coming in and it was gonna slam and basically cause a nuclear meltdown in Russia.
[03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:52.729]  And he said, well, it's okay, we know how to aim it.
[03:11:52.809 --> 03:11:55.510]  Well, if you know how to aim it, you can aim it at other people too.
[03:11:55.889 --> 03:12:01.350]  Now, I think one of the problems that they have, there's an effect inside the UFO technology, which is called apotheum.
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:02.420]  Inside.
[03:12:02.860 --> 03:12:08.299]  That's the reference of this thing that takes place in the interaction of them.
[03:12:08.379 --> 03:12:10.799]  You can read it in the earliest UFO cases.
[03:12:10.799 --> 03:12:20.959]  And what happens is basically when they send scientists in there, they can only work on this stuff for 20 minutes at a time because their health deteriorates or they go into a mental situation.
[03:12:20.959 --> 03:12:24.959]  Their whole cosmic consciousness opens up while they're working on this stuff.
[03:12:25.149 --> 03:12:29.549]  So they have 20 minute protocols in 1948 for going in and dealing with a crash craft.
[03:12:29.850 --> 03:12:34.489]  Well, when you get later and later into the development of the UFO file, we get less and less information.
[03:12:34.489 --> 03:12:40.989]  But that's a gem back there because it gives us an idea that when you interact with the stuff, you change.
[03:12:41.069 --> 03:12:48.510]  And this is the nature of the problem, which is I think part of the UFO problem that they've had is they don't know how to aim it Exactly right.
[03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:53.510]  And do we have any idea, is it because it's opening up some type of interdimensional field or?
[03:12:53.770 --> 03:12:55.489]  Yes, there's no question about it.
[03:12:55.549 --> 03:12:57.530]  This is a very interesting side of it also.
[03:12:57.770 --> 03:13:05.049]  Because what happens with the whole apotheum effect is when you read those cases, how many honest people have said, I lost all this time.
[03:13:05.149 --> 03:13:07.610]  I was going down the highway, it was eight hours later.
[03:13:08.110 --> 03:13:10.110]  Those people have no reason to lie about that.
[03:13:10.530 --> 03:13:16.729]  What happens basically is it introduces a totally different type of physics, a reality distortion physics.
[03:13:17.069 --> 03:13:25.809]  And when you get into that kind of physics, if you read the cases, there was a professor, a Harvard professor, psychiatrist named John Mack, who studied the fact.
[03:13:25.930 --> 03:13:30.010]  And he said, when people get abducted, they're actually abducted through the wall.
[03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:31.770]  They get pulled through things.
[03:13:31.909 --> 03:13:34.690]  How do you reason that out if it's a physical happening?
[03:13:35.169 --> 03:13:38.309]  So something extra-dimensional is going on.
[03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:39.809]  Well, let me tell you a personal story.
[03:13:40.030 --> 03:13:42.930]  And listeners, I don't get up here and lie to you about stuff, okay?
[03:13:43.909 --> 03:13:47.270]  But I've proven it because I've decided to do that more often.
[03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:53.989]  But I would have these dreams when I was a kid where I would wake up nauseous and really whatever.
[03:13:54.190 --> 03:13:55.690]  And then it would be something that didn't really matter.
[03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:57.790]  But a week later, two weeks later, the exact thing would happen.
[03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:59.389]  And I would remember it and know it.
[03:13:59.790 --> 03:14:02.250]  And then I would have these other events where like, hey, get up.
[03:14:02.989 --> 03:14:04.129]  You know, go turn your phone on.
[03:14:04.209 --> 03:14:05.590]  It's going to be exactly 4 a.m.
[03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:08.110]  And then it's like, now I want you to listen.
[03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.870]  This is real.
[03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:11.989]  And so I'm like, I'm going to sound crazy doing this.
[03:14:12.090 --> 03:14:14.889]  But then on election night, I feel kind of that feeling.
[03:14:14.889 --> 03:14:15.989]  You can actually see me on air.
[03:14:16.270 --> 03:14:17.870]  And I go, well, let me, how do I introduce this?
[03:14:17.950 --> 03:14:20.790]  And it's like, okay, let's predict when Trump comes out on stage.
[03:14:20.909 --> 03:14:25.290]  And I go, 127. And I just stop because, but it's like, it's the same thing.
[03:14:25.350 --> 03:14:26.489]  It's like a tap on the shoulder.
[03:14:26.770 --> 03:14:32.049]  And it's kind of a warm feeling, but kind of like a, you don't want, and I've had that happen a lot.
[03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:37.260]  And you read all the ancient writings and stuff that's described by mystics in the past, all that.
[03:14:37.379 --> 03:14:39.799]  And it's like something's opening up and giving you something.
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:41.579]  But when it's doing it, you're just like, ugh.
[03:14:41.979 --> 03:14:43.620]  And that's an experience I've had.
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:45.280]  And I've shown people that on air.
[03:14:45.319 --> 03:14:48.420]  And I've been basically told I'm going to do it more.
[03:14:49.379 --> 03:14:51.680]  But it's wild.
[03:14:53.899 --> 03:14:55.120]  Oh, that is fascinating.
[03:14:55.340 --> 03:14:58.100]  Well, I remember you talking about a relative.
[03:14:58.299 --> 03:14:59.100]  Is it a grandmother?
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:00.680]  Yeah, my mother's grandmother.
[03:15:01.819 --> 03:15:04.520]  And they try to recruit her as a psychic at a certain point.
[03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:08.559]  I mean, she was like presidents would come to see her in Dallas.
[03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:10.459]  That is fascinating.
[03:15:10.700 --> 03:15:10.879]  Wow.
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:27.600]  Well, I can tell you this in relation to the psychic side of this on the UFO side, which is there's a guy named Russell Targ who ran the remote viewing program for the CIA originally and then got away from them when he saw what they were doing with it, including the fact that they bumped off one of his psychics.
[03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:43.809]  But what happens is he told me that von Braun came to him and said, we need you to come up with something which is a way to test the psychic abilities of these NASA astronauts because I only want the ones with the highest ESP going on these projects.
[03:15:43.809 --> 03:15:44.430]  Oh, and that's true.
[03:15:44.569 --> 03:15:45.049]  That's come out.
[03:15:45.309 --> 03:15:45.969]  Stay right there.
[03:15:46.149 --> 03:15:47.709]  I talked to a high-level NASA guy.
[03:15:47.809 --> 03:15:48.209]  He's dead now.
[03:15:48.290 --> 03:15:50.030]  He said that NASA was really a cover.
[03:15:50.430 --> 03:15:55.829]  And I talked to a top Microsoft person, told me the same thing, that That's really a cover for testing psychic abilities.
[03:15:56.030 --> 03:15:58.170]  We'll be right back with our special guest, Dark Journalist.
[03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.530]  Stay with us.
[03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:59.250]  Your call straight ahead.
[03:15:59.350 --> 03:15:59.870]  Be patient, folks.
[03:15:59.969 --> 03:16:00.430]  I want to get to you.
[03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:08.510]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[03:16:08.530 --> 03:16:09.610]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:16:10.030 --> 03:16:15.049]  This is one of the pinnacles of my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[03:16:15.049 --> 03:16:16.229]  I never imagined I'd be.
[03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:17.190]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:16:17.250 --> 03:16:17.870]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:16:17.969 --> 03:16:18.670]  I can't wait.
[03:16:19.239 --> 03:16:21.440]  To learn who the next winner is.
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:24.020]  And even if they shut out Info Wars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:26.200]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me.
[03:16:26.319 --> 03:16:30.399]  So we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[03:16:30.559 --> 03:16:31.120]  We already knew that.
[03:16:31.239 --> 03:16:32.479]  But now they've bragged about it.
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:37.680]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on to the Alex Jones Network.
[03:16:37.899 --> 03:16:40.459]  And so this baby is the new promotion.
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:41.879]  And I will be...
[03:16:42.219 --> 03:16:50.100]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alex Shows Network family.
[03:16:50.299 --> 03:16:51.739]  You are our family.
[03:16:52.020 --> 03:16:53.180]  God bless you all.
[03:16:53.440 --> 03:16:56.420]  Now go to thealexshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[03:16:56.559 --> 03:16:58.280]  Please stand by for further details.
[03:16:58.639 --> 03:17:00.620]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[03:17:33.130 --> 03:17:38.200]  Alright folks, I... You haven't told those stories on there to try to impress people.
[03:17:38.319 --> 03:17:39.020]  It's just the truth.
[03:17:39.639 --> 03:17:55.260]  And when dark journalist Daniel was talking about the Bell Project, the Glock, all that, and how people would get disturbed by it, I've described moments in history that only happen every once in a while where I'm not on drugs,
[03:17:55.459 --> 03:18:01.600]  totally healthy, can be in my bedroom, can be in a restaurant, eating by myself, but all of a sudden...
[03:18:02.750 --> 03:18:10.549]  It's kind of like in the Johnny Cash song, Cut You Down, where he says, I thought I heard the shovel of the angel's feet.
[03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:12.489]  It's not like a schizophrenic thing.
[03:18:12.489 --> 03:18:13.270]  I've never had anything.
[03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:17.670]  I don't ever hear voices and any of that stuff, where it's all of a sudden, you feel like the presence.
[03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:19.209]  You're like, whoa, what's going on?
[03:18:19.969 --> 03:18:29.889]  And then, this happened when I was a kid and throughout my life, then you would feel this presence and then be having a mental conversation with it.
[03:18:29.930 --> 03:18:30.590]  And like, what is that?
[03:18:30.610 --> 03:18:32.010]  You could tell it's from outside of you.
[03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:37.250]  And then it's like, I'm going to show you this so you know this is real.
[03:18:38.729 --> 03:18:41.290]  And then if you, do you want to know more?
[03:18:42.090 --> 03:18:49.209]  And then when I've been on the air a few years, and I go to calls, folks, just when you get into NASA and the whole shadow thing, they don't want us to know what we really are.
[03:18:49.989 --> 03:18:51.690]  It's like, okay, you're doing this.
[03:18:51.829 --> 03:18:52.569]  This is good.
[03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:53.629]  We're standing for humanity.
[03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:55.829]  Stop the depopulation.
[03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.870]  You want to protect the children, right?
[03:18:57.309 --> 03:18:58.989]  Now, this is going to get rough on you.
[03:18:59.370 --> 03:19:00.569]  Do you want to know more?
[03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:01.510]  Yes, I want to know more.
[03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:02.409]  Okay, are you sure?
[03:19:03.030 --> 03:19:04.870]  And then, like, here's possible scenarios.
[03:19:05.090 --> 03:19:05.569]  It's like, whoa.
[03:19:06.090 --> 03:19:11.790]  And then it is like you are discombobulated.
[03:19:13.930 --> 03:19:15.030]  It gets more intense.
[03:19:16.690 --> 03:19:17.909]  Almost like nauseous.
[03:19:18.129 --> 03:19:21.370]  It's like you're not in this world, basically.
[03:19:22.129 --> 03:19:23.430]  Like a bridge has been opened.
[03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:29.329]  And again, my parents never wanted to really tell me about this.
[03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:30.690]  I only heard about it here and there.
[03:19:30.850 --> 03:19:32.389]  And I really should go interrogate my mother.
[03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:33.170]  But it's like a weird thing.
[03:19:33.250 --> 03:19:34.409]  She really doesn't want to talk about it now.
[03:19:35.690 --> 03:19:37.709]  And she's like, your grandfather's very eccentric.
[03:19:37.889 --> 03:19:39.829]  And I knew my great-grandmother.
[03:19:39.989 --> 03:19:41.409]  She died when I was nine.
[03:19:41.850 --> 03:19:43.010]  She lived here in Austin then.
[03:19:43.049 --> 03:19:43.969]  And I remember going to her funeral.
[03:19:44.250 --> 03:19:45.649]  I'd go over and see her great oil painter.
[03:19:46.030 --> 03:19:48.030]  And she liked drinking Jack Daniels.
[03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:56.129]  My grandfather's dad, who was a very successful businessman, he died when he was like 50 of a huge heart attack.
[03:19:56.250 --> 03:19:57.750]  She remarried this other guy named Clyde.
[03:19:58.309 --> 03:20:02.329]  But the point was, they would never really...
[03:20:02.329 --> 03:20:04.510]  And my grandfather would start telling me stuff sometimes.
[03:20:04.610 --> 03:20:06.389]  My mother would be like, now, now, Dad, don't...
[03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:07.690]  You know, your grandfather's just very eccentric.
[03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:10.030]  And he was like, knew all this stuff.
[03:20:10.129 --> 03:20:12.030]  I mean, he was telling me all this stuff when I'm a kid.
[03:20:13.069 --> 03:20:13.389]  And...
[03:20:14.420 --> 03:20:20.319]  Before I ever got in politics and stuff, he was really like, you know, you're going to do a whole lot of really important stuff, and you're going to change the world, and blah, blah, blah.
[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:22.000]  And my mother would be like, Dad, stop it.
[03:20:23.479 --> 03:20:31.840]  But the point was, they told me, and I also overheard this when I was a kid, that literally, like, she was a channeler.
[03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:34.370]  And she wasn't like some gypsy on the side of the road.
[03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:37.010]  It was just this known thing.
[03:20:37.250 --> 03:20:42.870]  And big, powerful people in Dallas would come to talk to her.
[03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:45.270]  And then they got...
[03:20:45.270 --> 03:20:51.239]  Around the time my grandfather was 50. And she was, you know, whatever she was, 75 or whatever.
[03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:56.319]  They just said, like, we're Christians and we're not involved in this anymore.
[03:20:56.920 --> 03:20:58.559]  And that's it.
[03:20:58.959 --> 03:21:00.899]  And we're not discussing any of this.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:01.680]  And this is done.
[03:21:01.819 --> 03:21:02.579]  And this is demonic.
[03:21:02.780 --> 03:21:03.600]  And we're not involved.
[03:21:04.180 --> 03:21:05.760]  And then that was it.
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:09.360]  I've got to find out more because my parents don't want to talk about it.
[03:21:09.479 --> 03:21:12.719]  But that's, there's a whole undercurrent of this is my point, Dark Journalist.
[03:21:12.719 --> 03:21:14.040]  I wasn't trying to write myself in the story.
[03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:15.200]  Those are just true stories.
[03:21:17.129 --> 03:21:18.909]  No, no, they're very interesting.
[03:21:19.329 --> 03:21:28.129]  And the other thing I think, and you've mentioned it before, which is that Von Braun somehow there was a relative that was related or knew something about Von Braun.
[03:21:28.129 --> 03:21:28.930]  Yeah, that was my grandfather.
[03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:31.149]  Yeah, see, that's very interesting.
[03:21:32.989 --> 03:21:38.229]  Werner Von Braun came to town and my grandfather took my mother when she was like five, my uncle, they was like ten.
[03:21:38.569 --> 03:21:41.850]  And they went down to UT and there was like a private dinner or something, yeah.
[03:21:42.969 --> 03:21:48.250]  Well, it's fascinating because his mother, what Targ told me about Von Braun is that his mother was psychic.
[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:58.819]  So when Braun's mother was psychic and she was well-known in Germany, and they would come to her for everything from national events to weather events or whatever it was, she was that well-known on the psychic side.
[03:21:58.979 --> 03:22:04.479]  So there is this psychic connection with the aerospace part, and that's why there's a mythology around it.
[03:22:04.540 --> 03:22:23.290]  That's why you have Aleister Crowley and Jack Parsons around NASA and the setup of NASA, because there's a mystical spirits of the air thing that's involved, and that's why you see Masonic Rituals happening on the moon when they land there, and Buzz Aldrin doing this whole thing for the Masons.
[03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:33.139]  So there's an aspect there, there's a mystical aspect there, and the more that they get the public not to talk about it, the more they get to kind of hoard The realizations.
[03:22:33.379 --> 03:22:38.219]  But everyone is basically an antenna for this around the psychic side, some more than others.
[03:22:38.219 --> 03:22:40.040]  There's no question about that.
[03:22:40.260 --> 03:22:40.940]  It's very interesting.
[03:22:40.979 --> 03:22:48.200]  If you go into the Casey readings, they would ask him, because he could just read somebody's name and figure out their ailment and all this other stuff about them.
[03:22:48.299 --> 03:22:49.979]  And they would say, where are you getting this information?
[03:22:50.139 --> 03:22:53.639]  While he's in trance, he said, from the subconscious mind of the person who asked for the reading.
[03:22:54.260 --> 03:22:56.139]  Everyone is sort of a connected thing.
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:22:59.440]  There are all these little towers connected out there in relation to this.
[03:23:00.020 --> 03:23:17.079]  One thing I will say about predictions in aerospace is there's a story, and it comes out of Houston, interestingly enough, about a painter named Charles Delshow, who was associated with an early aerospace group called NIMSA. And they were doing much more advanced things than the Wright brothers.
[03:23:17.319 --> 03:23:21.239]  And he was plugged into it and had come over here from Germany.
[03:23:21.500 --> 03:23:30.739]  Right in the middle of one of his paintings, which were rediscovered in the 1970s, right in the middle of one of those aeroship paintings is the name Trump.
[03:23:31.479 --> 03:23:33.239]  And I've verified this.
[03:23:33.319 --> 03:23:39.299]  It's been in an art gallery since 1977. And on the bottom right, the series is 45 pages.
[03:23:40.299 --> 03:23:41.219]  For the art series.
[03:23:41.239 --> 03:23:46.579]  You got Trump, the arrow, and 45. I actually put it up on my Twitter account.
[03:23:47.139 --> 03:23:48.319]  It's right there for everybody.
[03:23:48.459 --> 03:23:51.260]  I put it in my recent documentary, The Final Speech.
[03:23:51.299 --> 03:23:53.540]  There's a whole thing in there on deep aerospace.
[03:23:53.899 --> 03:24:02.420]  But this level of prediction going on with this guy, Delshow, who is Plugged into a very early aerospace group.
[03:24:02.639 --> 03:24:08.260]  Makes you wonder, we on our side have been able to say, well, we got a certain amount of technology.
[03:24:08.500 --> 03:24:09.879]  We took the rocket program.
[03:24:09.879 --> 03:24:10.680]  We plugged it in.
[03:24:10.739 --> 03:24:12.079]  We got NASA and all the rest of it.
[03:24:12.180 --> 03:24:13.479]  But how old is it really?
[03:24:13.739 --> 03:24:16.559]  I mean, that's what the public understands and what the public knows.
[03:24:17.020 --> 03:24:20.420]  What area and what level have we taken this?
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:22.879]  And it's not just an ancient aliens kind of trip.
[03:24:23.420 --> 03:24:26.719]  As a matter of fact, there's a very interesting thing.
[03:24:26.879 --> 03:24:38.899]  If you go back there and look at some of the Mystery School work, When they get asked the question, well, what about this Atlantean technology that's going on with the flying ships that you're talking about that can fly through mountains, not just over them?
[03:24:39.479 --> 03:24:41.520]  And they said, can you describe that?
[03:24:41.639 --> 03:24:47.219]  And he said, oh, yeah, actually, this is something that Ezekiel saw, but that was a much later date.
[03:24:47.770 --> 03:24:49.569]  So that's the Atlantean technology.
[03:24:49.770 --> 03:25:00.170]  Somebody kept it from, let's say, 10,000, 15,000 BC all the way to 1,000 BC. So the aerospace piece has been handed down through these mystery groups over time.
[03:25:00.190 --> 03:25:06.629]  And we've got Aztec figurines that looks like a 747 with engine.
[03:25:06.850 --> 03:25:07.030]  Oh, yes.
[03:25:07.350 --> 03:25:08.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:09.489]  There's no question about it.
[03:25:09.709 --> 03:25:12.190]  And that's been in the Madrid Museum for hundreds of years.
[03:25:13.719 --> 03:25:15.700]  Yes, and it's only until we got flight.
[03:25:15.899 --> 03:25:20.819]  If you look at something like the NASCA lines, nobody even knew that they were there until we got flight.
[03:25:21.059 --> 03:25:26.379]  And then when somebody's flying over and they can see the whole thing, it's like, oh, this map, this whole thing with these unusual figures waving.
[03:25:27.459 --> 03:25:30.620]  So the stuff was done 3,000, 4,000 years ago.
[03:25:31.409 --> 03:25:36.629]  So we're just rediscovering an ancient history that's been kept from us, but the ministry schools at least think they know it.
[03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.909]  Let's get to some calls.
[03:25:38.010 --> 03:25:38.690]  I can talk to you for 10 hours.
[03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:39.709]  You've got to come back more often.
[03:25:39.909 --> 03:25:41.549]  You can co-host if you want.
[03:25:42.049 --> 03:25:43.709]  I'm like, we haven't had dark journalists on.
[03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:44.309]  What the hell's going on?
[03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:46.450]  Thanks for calling to remind me of your great work.
[03:25:46.530 --> 03:25:47.290]  I watch it all the time.
[03:25:47.709 --> 03:25:48.709]  Dale, thank you for holding.
[03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:52.049]  I apologize for making you hold, but I want to get to all the callers, but then I don't.
[03:25:52.329 --> 03:25:53.569]  Dale in Ohio on war.
[03:25:53.690 --> 03:25:53.909]  Go ahead.
[03:25:53.969 --> 03:25:55.069]  What's your take on that situation?
[03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:57.170]  Alright, Alex.
[03:25:57.370 --> 03:26:00.909]  So, I actually wanted to say two things to the viewers.
[03:26:01.170 --> 03:26:18.030]  The first being, if your average viewer base at, say, 50 million people were to go to thealexjohnstore.com and buy one of your guys' stickers, just one sticker, if 50 million people bought one sticker,
[03:26:18.250 --> 03:26:29.799]  you'd have $540 million that you could fight the deep state, pay your crew, and Just make the show all around better for all of us viewers.
[03:26:30.159 --> 03:26:31.559]  You have my pledge.
[03:26:32.540 --> 03:26:33.200]  Here's the deal.
[03:26:33.379 --> 03:26:35.079]  The globalists spend all the money to be in control.
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:37.659]  Little people don't spend their money politically.
[03:26:37.659 --> 03:26:38.680]  That's why we lose.
[03:26:38.799 --> 03:26:41.299]  They finally got up with Trump, finally gave him money.
[03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:44.120]  He was able to pay for all the lawyers to stop a lot of the steel.
[03:26:44.239 --> 03:26:48.000]  But absolutely, the globalists don't put their money into things because they're charitable.
[03:26:48.219 --> 03:26:50.159]  They do it because they know that's where power is.
[03:26:50.299 --> 03:26:51.079]  So I'm not complaining.
[03:26:51.079 --> 03:26:52.180]  We literally are reaching...
[03:26:53.010 --> 03:26:58.889]  I mean, some days, 100 million people on X, but I mean, look, just on the radio, 5, 6, 7 million everywhere.
[03:26:59.049 --> 03:26:59.770]  And I'm not complaining.
[03:26:59.770 --> 03:27:03.950]  It's just paradoxical that less than one-tenth to one percent, actually, ever buy anything.
[03:27:04.129 --> 03:27:05.870]  And I'm right now up against the wall financially.
[03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:06.690]  It'd be so easy.
[03:27:06.829 --> 03:27:09.450]  But God likes to keep me, you know, I guess, on edge.
[03:27:09.569 --> 03:27:10.610]  So I'm not mad about it.
[03:27:10.770 --> 03:27:12.270]  I understand it, but I appreciate you.
[03:27:12.290 --> 03:27:13.530]  Let's talk about World War III, brother.
[03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.850]  Go ahead.
[03:27:15.069 --> 03:27:22.489]  Yeah, so on the World War III topic, I wanted to also address to the viewers, Look out for your caves.
[03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:23.870]  Look out for your caverns.
[03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:34.149]  Look out for anything that you can go underground publicly, obviously without getting hurt or getting intervened between the federal government.
[03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:36.450]  Those are safe places.
[03:27:38.220 --> 03:27:41.219]  Because, I mean, ultimately, it may be out of our control.
[03:27:41.399 --> 03:27:42.760]  We may not be able to do anything.
[03:27:42.879 --> 03:27:46.540]  They may escalate it before we can even put a stop to it.
[03:27:46.659 --> 03:27:53.479]  So for the people that don't really have a bunker or don't really have, you know, a plan, those places are good.
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:56.180]  And then I just wanted to hit on a few things.
[03:27:56.340 --> 03:27:59.760]  Those money hits to the Fed, that is what's going to stop it.
[03:27:59.899 --> 03:28:04.879]  Once we stop giving them money, because they're raping us in taxes.
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:07.139]  I mean, it's plain and simple.
[03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:08.569]  No, Dale, I hear you.
[03:28:08.629 --> 03:28:11.049]  That's part of the exit, is pulling out of the system if we can.
[03:28:11.329 --> 03:28:12.090]  Thanks for the call.
[03:28:12.370 --> 03:28:13.870]  You know, dark journalists, it's a bummer.
[03:28:13.930 --> 03:28:16.010]  I'm taking calls earlier before we came on.
[03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:18.229]  People are kind of just saying, well, we're going to have a nuclear war.
[03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:19.930]  I hope that's not the case.
[03:28:20.069 --> 03:28:23.629]  Do you think NATO's trying to start one, or what's going on?
[03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:27.540]  They are definitely taking it to the brink.
[03:28:27.639 --> 03:28:36.020]  And it makes you wonder if they don't have this ability to launch nuclear weapons without the fallout aspect because they're acting so easy and free.
[03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:40.600]  And you're seeing these articles come out like saying, hey, a nuclear war, we could still get by with that.
[03:28:40.600 --> 03:28:42.020]  It's not as scary as you think.
[03:28:42.879 --> 03:28:46.139]  The Atlantic put out an article like that.
[03:28:46.239 --> 03:28:47.260]  It's absolutely absurd.
[03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:56.600]  And when you think about it, too, when I have looked into the nuclear aspect, the nuclear aspect is actually very dangerous, but very old technology.
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:06.299]  And this is part of the problem, which is the really advanced stuff beyond nuclear, so far beyond nuclear, that they don't want to reveal that aspect.
[03:29:06.299 --> 03:29:16.299]  So we're still stuck at the stage of looking at each other with nuclear weapons and saying, hey, if you make this action, you're incurring nuclear wrath and all the rest of it.
[03:29:16.750 --> 03:29:27.049]  We are in such a situation in Ukraine, I think, where they've just pushed it through the Biden administration, this group that's behind the Biden administration.
[03:29:27.430 --> 03:29:29.290]  And he's on his way out.
[03:29:29.450 --> 03:29:33.250]  For them to be taking these provocative moves are unprecedented in history.
[03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:37.790]  It has never happened before that we have a president on his way out starting a war.
[03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:38.229]  Absolutely.
[03:29:39.090 --> 03:29:42.790]  Yeah, they're wrapping it up usually, and they're doing this whole program.
[03:29:43.270 --> 03:29:55.069]  What's interesting to me is that if they were willing to give up the nuclear side as far back as 1987 and go to what they call the zero option, they had a whole program for getting rid of every nuclear weapon.
[03:29:55.250 --> 03:29:57.930]  That means they've had the technology perfected.
[03:29:58.280 --> 03:29:59.379]  At least that law.
[03:29:59.579 --> 03:30:01.159]  And this is the nature of the problem.
[03:30:01.440 --> 03:30:07.159]  That's why the public is in such a schizophrenic kind of state with the leadership right now when you look at it.
[03:30:07.239 --> 03:30:09.819]  Because you have the advanced technology in their hands.
[03:30:09.979 --> 03:30:11.739]  The public doesn't know anything about it.
[03:30:12.299 --> 03:30:14.860]  And this is the back and forth that's going on.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:17.899]  So they're making decisions based on what they actually have.
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:21.780]  And we're in the public looking at it saying, hey, aren't you risking nuclear war with this?
[03:30:21.920 --> 03:30:22.319]  Well said.
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:23.559]  Let's take another call.
[03:30:23.680 --> 03:30:24.920]  George in Connecticut, go ahead.
[03:30:26.530 --> 03:30:27.190]  Hi, Alex.
[03:30:27.489 --> 03:30:43.229]  Yeah, I was wondering why we shouldn't call all of our congressmen, senators, and all the other people in the government and remind them of their duty that the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8,
[03:30:44.270 --> 03:30:49.309]  It requires Congress to be the only department that can declare war.
[03:30:49.530 --> 03:31:04.930]  And anybody else moving to that end is a traitor because their job is to keep us safe, their job is to keep us from war, and also keep our economy from destruction.
[03:31:04.989 --> 03:31:08.590]  And they're doing everything in their might to do exactly that.
[03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:33.010]  And they had their oath of office, which is five U.S. code We're good to go.
[03:31:33.530 --> 03:31:54.149]  And I think Mike Flynn would be a perfect envoy to Russia and the European Union, maybe even the UN, to basically, if Trump could send him there, and basically hammer this out and prevent this war from happening,
[03:31:54.149 --> 03:32:02.549]  since he's not been picked for any important cabinet posts, this would be a very useful person to use for that.
[03:32:04.169 --> 03:32:04.889]  Excellent point.
[03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:13.309]  And, you know, to Dark Journalist's point, they're acting like they're not worried about nuclear war, saying that we know they have clean bombs, not just neutron bombs.
[03:32:14.129 --> 03:32:18.989]  But in all the scenarios, that will make the regular nuclear reactors meltdown that are ultra-dirty.
[03:32:18.989 --> 03:32:20.909]  So you just can't do it.
[03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:22.049]  It's totally psychotic.
[03:32:22.170 --> 03:32:22.829]  Thank you, George.
[03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:25.690]  Let's talk to Mike in Idaho, who's been holding a long time.
[03:32:25.770 --> 03:32:27.309]  Mike, I actually missed your call there somehow.
[03:32:27.389 --> 03:32:28.090]  I've been holding too long.
[03:32:28.190 --> 03:32:28.510]  I apologize.
[03:32:28.989 --> 03:32:31.030]  Mike in Idaho, you're on the air on World War III. Go ahead.
[03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.809]  No worries, Alex.
[03:32:32.969 --> 03:32:33.469]  How you doing, man?
[03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:34.989]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[03:32:35.350 --> 03:32:36.989]  I've been listening to you 20 years, man.
[03:32:37.569 --> 03:32:38.170]  Love you guys.
[03:32:38.750 --> 03:32:39.149]  Love you, Jim.
[03:32:39.649 --> 03:32:41.610]  Joe Biden has to be impeached, man.
[03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:43.069]  We have to impeach him now.
[03:32:43.250 --> 03:32:45.649]  I was really excited to hear the legal scholar last week.
[03:32:46.370 --> 03:32:47.229]  Documents have been drafted.
[03:32:48.280 --> 03:32:51.559]  Instead of sitting around all weekend getting fat, people, we need to call Congress.
[03:32:51.760 --> 03:32:53.540]  Let's blow their phones up this weekend.
[03:32:53.719 --> 03:32:55.059]  We need to impeach him.
[03:32:55.120 --> 03:32:55.819]  We need him out.
[03:32:55.899 --> 03:32:57.719]  He is the one giving the missiles to Ukraine.
[03:32:58.180 --> 03:32:59.420]  There are no clean bombs.
[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:04.620]  We will all have blood on our hands if those bombs drop, and this has to be addressed.
[03:33:04.899 --> 03:33:09.260]  If we don't take care of Joe Biden, we deserve to be bombed, as far as I'm concerned.
[03:33:09.340 --> 03:33:10.440]  He's got to go, man.
[03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:13.780]  Absolutely.
[03:33:14.620 --> 03:33:16.399]  Our journalist, Daniel, what do you think?
[03:33:16.700 --> 03:33:20.500]  I mean, I'm surprised Trump hasn't made statements in the last few weeks.
[03:33:21.700 --> 03:33:22.600]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[03:33:22.739 --> 03:33:28.840]  Trump, you mentioned that he should go out and use that bully pulpit now, and this is a crucial period where he's in between.
[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:32.239]  So he's president-elect, and he has the ability to do that.
[03:33:32.459 --> 03:33:36.860]  They have not been rocking the boat enough, in my opinion, around the war effort.
[03:33:36.959 --> 03:33:41.040]  They may be doing a lot in the background, as you pointed that out, And I'm sure that they are.
[03:33:41.299 --> 03:33:52.219]  But nonetheless, I think that they should say, look, we're looking for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine and all of this war talk and the provocations, we're taking it down a notch.
[03:33:52.360 --> 03:33:57.399]  And I implore both sides, this administration and the Putin side to take the heat down.
[03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:01.700]  Well, that's the right move and it's a perfect day before Thanksgiving message.
[03:34:01.860 --> 03:34:05.020]  I mean, if he doesn't do it by tomorrow, I'm gonna start getting worried, Daniel.
[03:34:06.399 --> 03:34:06.899]  I know.
[03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:07.420]  I know.
[03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:08.219]  I can appreciate it.
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:15.040]  And I think we are in a time of kind of maximum peril because they are being pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed.
[03:34:15.120 --> 03:34:17.100]  And so we're in a very dangerous state.
[03:34:17.260 --> 03:34:27.399]  And I think that when you're looking at the combination, I go back to the fact that we had this very unusual incident with Trump being assassinated twice.
[03:34:27.559 --> 03:34:30.479]  The assassination attempts went down on both occasions.
[03:34:30.860 --> 03:34:43.270]  And on one of those occasions, the Secret Service director Who, you know, around the Thomas Matthew Crooks thing set up all the really bad setup and defense and security.
[03:34:43.469 --> 03:34:48.049]  So all the security stripping that was going on with the Secret Service stand down at that incident in Butler.
[03:34:49.250 --> 03:34:56.149]  It's very interesting to me because if you go into her past a little bit, you're going to find that she was Dick Cheney's.
[03:34:56.600 --> 03:35:01.979]  Secret Service person and she's the one who dragged him into the COG bunker during 9-11.
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:12.079]  So the COG aspect has operated and continues to operate and it's very interesting that it always seems represented at key points in these deep events.
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:13.780]  For example, the assassination.
[03:35:14.219 --> 03:35:29.180]  I think that the COG group in particular looks at Trump as the ultimate threat and they are ready to stand in Whether or not he's been elected, and they have the perfect opportunity through the announcement of emergency powers.
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:37.940]  I think the road to that announcement is very tricky for them, and that they, on the inside, would prefer not to do it, but they're ready to do it.
[03:35:38.020 --> 03:35:40.559]  I totally agree, and here's the most important point I want to get your take on.
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:41.260]  We'll take it for more calls.
[03:35:42.189 --> 03:35:47.969]  Daniel, we've never seen them rolling it out and beta testing it and introducing it like we are now.
[03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:51.850]  I mean, this looks like they're getting ready to unveil it.
[03:35:51.969 --> 03:36:03.250]  We just don't know the exact scenario or what that civil emergency, national emergency scenario would be, but they really are hyping power outages to be blamed on the Russians, something along those lines.
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:05.659]  Exactly.
[03:36:06.079 --> 03:36:09.559]  The Russian cyber attack, this whole thing.
[03:36:09.559 --> 03:36:13.579]  I think that they put us in a very interesting position also with all the emergency aspects.
[03:36:13.780 --> 03:36:18.379]  Because what happens is, we go into a situation where they have a number of options that they can tap.
[03:36:18.620 --> 03:36:20.819]  They've gotten a lot of data back from this.
[03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:29.479]  For example, on the UFO side, when they did the whole thing about, Northcom is looking at this, we're shooting down UFOs, which was an actual headline in the New York Times.
[03:36:29.799 --> 03:36:37.200]  If you think about that, you know, and the openness that they have around the UFO subject in Congress, it is unnerving in that sense.
[03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:39.579]  Not that they're giving out real, genuine disclosure.
[03:36:39.819 --> 03:36:43.639]  There's two versions of disclosure there, the real thing and then CIA disclosure.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:47.819]  But the fact that they're going into it means they have a plan to roll the thing out.
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:59.559]  And when you see people who are in key positions, like Marco Rubio, for example, who was really big on getting this UFO defense office going, a lot of them, interestingly enough, are coming out of Florida as well.
[03:36:59.790 --> 03:37:09.370]  But for me, when I look at that, I say, well, they're looking at rolling out one of those scenarios, and they're kind of vying for which scenario would work on the emergency side.
[03:37:09.790 --> 03:37:14.469]  Whoever's running the Biden administration is trying to get all this accomplished before Trump gets in.
[03:37:14.590 --> 03:37:19.209]  And this is also why they rolled out the UFO hearing a week after the election.
[03:37:19.850 --> 03:37:27.010]  They're trying to institute a program and probably move materials as well before Trump gets in and then has access to the whole thing.
[03:37:27.190 --> 03:37:29.329]  And they're moving a lot of stuff in Ukraine as well.
[03:37:30.889 --> 03:37:32.010]  Yes, exactly.
[03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:34.850]  Well, they want the whole peace with Ukraine.
[03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:37.790]  They want to make that some kind of New Jerusalem, right?
[03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:39.389]  This is what their goal is.
[03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:53.090]  And for me, when I look at what's going on there, the amount of risks that they've taken have been completely off the charts and show that whoever's operating in the background has reached a level of desperation for control that I think is very dangerous on our side.
[03:37:53.409 --> 03:37:58.750]  So this period now that we're looking at between here and the inauguration is probably the most dangerous period.
[03:37:58.989 --> 03:38:02.729]  It was more dangerous for Trump in that sense even than the election.
[03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:17.149]  And there's clearly admitted different factions battling, and Musk and Trump, regardless, represent an attempt to say the ruling class is out of control.
[03:38:17.409 --> 03:38:19.469]  Their world government's going to get us all killed.
[03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:23.290]  You can't cut the resources off the planet and then process out the population.
[03:38:23.290 --> 03:38:24.409]  That's going to trigger wars.
[03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:25.430]  People know about the plan.
[03:38:25.450 --> 03:38:26.229]  It's not going to work.
[03:38:26.590 --> 03:38:29.389]  I mean, it looks like we want to be pessimist.
[03:38:29.549 --> 03:38:32.329]  Trump and Musk are like an abort switch on the globalist plan.
[03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:34.450]  Or at least breaks.
[03:38:34.930 --> 03:38:36.729]  Yes, no question about it.
[03:38:36.930 --> 03:38:43.809]  Well, the key thing is the Kennedy Alliance, that Kennedy's in there and helped get Trump over the top.
[03:38:44.129 --> 03:38:52.889]  This is a very interesting aspect because when you look at that alliance, that must send absolute reverberations through the deep state on that.
[03:38:53.129 --> 03:38:56.809]  Because for a while, they were at odds, sort of playing off against each other.
[03:38:57.170 --> 03:39:01.649]  But as soon as that assassination attempt happened, they really became a single unit.
[03:39:01.930 --> 03:39:12.989]  And I think this aspect with Kennedy is interesting because Kennedy, on his side, has the background of John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy's UFO knowledge and their knowledge around the UFO file.
[03:39:13.409 --> 03:39:17.350]  Trump, through Uncle Trump, has the knowledge of the UFO file and the Tesla files.
[03:39:17.489 --> 03:39:24.469]  So the merging of those two things together, never mind the whole populist political presentation, which is good on its own.
[03:39:24.909 --> 03:39:44.069]  But the merging of that knowledge and information that they have, I think, makes them, if you look at that breakaway X-Protect group looking at that, they're terrified because they will, when they get in office, they'll both be looking at the ability to extract those programs out of the deep structure.
[03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:45.590]  This is the nature of the problem.
[03:39:45.729 --> 03:39:48.129]  When they look at Trump, they say, we don't want to deal with him.
[03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:50.909]  He's Roy Cohn's inside man.
[03:39:51.170 --> 03:39:53.989]  Roy Cohn knew where every deep state body was buried.
[03:39:54.920 --> 03:39:55.360]  You're right.
[03:39:55.479 --> 03:39:57.559]  Ran the House of America's Activity Committee.
[03:39:58.639 --> 03:40:00.459]  Dark Journalist Daniel List, thank you so much.

[03:40:54.680 --> 03:40:56.940]  People are ready to wake up right now.
[03:40:57.139 --> 03:40:58.260]  You're the ambassadors.
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:00.059]  You're the folks that carry the ball.
[03:41:00.219 --> 03:41:01.139]  We can do this.
[03:41:01.260 --> 03:41:02.940]  Pray to God for a great awakening.
[03:41:03.100 --> 03:41:04.700]  It's happening, but to accelerate it and for peace.
[03:41:04.860 --> 03:41:06.579]  And Trump, please come out publicly.
[03:41:06.899 --> 03:41:10.139]  Don't be waiting to get a big score and a big deal on ceasefire.

[03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:12.540]  Call for it now.
[03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:15.180]  Putin said he wants to hear it from you.
[03:41:15.319 --> 03:41:15.959]  Let's go.
[03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:17.299]  Come on.
[03:41:17.940 --> 03:41:18.479]  All right.
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:19.379]  Great job, crew.
[03:41:19.579 --> 03:41:20.440]  So thankful to you.
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:26.340]  I'm going to shoot some more reports today because time is of the essence when everybody have a fabulous Thanksgiving as well.
[03:41:26.600 --> 03:41:27.700]  But we're not done.
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:30.620]  The War Room comes up now and I'll be back tomorrow live 11 a.m.
[03:41:30.799 --> 03:41:35.719]  Central at Infowars.com forward slash show band out video and real Alex Jones on X. Follow me there.
[03:41:36.299 --> 03:41:41.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[03:41:41.920 --> 03:41:43.239]  He's only president-elect right now.
[03:41:43.420 --> 03:41:45.139]  We are exposing the globalists.
[03:41:45.219 --> 03:41:48.180]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[03:41:48.299 --> 03:41:50.020]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[03:41:50.379 --> 03:41:52.399]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:54.889]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[03:41:55.250 --> 03:42:00.750]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:06.209]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[03:42:06.430 --> 03:42:14.889]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:14.909 --> 03:42:18.270]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[03:42:18.739 --> 03:42:26.459]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:29.899]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[03:42:30.139 --> 03:42:31.420]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[03:42:31.579 --> 03:42:32.399]  Go check it out.
[03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:39.299]  That's there discounted up to 55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:40.040]  Try it.
[03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:40.700]  You're going to love it.
[03:42:40.780 --> 03:42:41.219]  I'm on it.
[03:42:41.299 --> 03:42:42.100]  I've lost so much weight.
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:43.059]  It's insane.
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:44.200]  Get that and other supplements.
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:44.799]  And then...
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:48.860]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:55.379]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[03:42:55.500 --> 03:42:56.340]  They had the best designs.
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:58.459]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[03:42:58.479 --> 03:43:00.940]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:02.600]  These designs are incredible.
[03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:09.000]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[03:43:09.159 --> 03:43:09.739]  Here they are.
[03:43:09.920 --> 03:43:10.700]  Look at this one.
[03:43:10.899 --> 03:43:14.760]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[03:43:15.020 --> 03:43:16.780]  We are all Alex Jones.
[03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:17.959]  You've got to get that.
[03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:20.280]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:21.219]  Oh my goodness.
[03:43:21.639 --> 03:43:24.840]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:28.239]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[03:43:28.700 --> 03:43:29.840]  Team Humanity.
[03:43:30.079 --> 03:43:31.540]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[03:43:31.659 --> 03:43:33.879]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[03:43:34.040 --> 03:43:35.799]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[03:43:36.250 --> 03:43:41.430]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[03:43:41.850 --> 03:43:42.770]  Darkest Hour.
[03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:44.250]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:49.350]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:43:49.430 --> 03:43:51.510]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[03:43:52.079 --> 03:43:56.879]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[03:43:57.020 --> 03:44:09.500]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[03:44:09.559 --> 03:44:13.299]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:17.200]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[03:44:17.319 --> 03:44:19.639]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[03:44:19.799 --> 03:44:21.059]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[03:44:21.139 --> 03:44:22.379]  We get part of it to operate.
[03:44:23.059 --> 03:44:25.579]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[03:44:25.739 --> 03:44:26.579]  And they spread the word.
[03:44:26.659 --> 03:44:27.340]  You meet like-minded people.
[03:44:27.459 --> 03:44:33.739]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[03:44:33.799 --> 03:44:36.979]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[03:44:37.379 --> 03:44:47.989]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[03:44:48.149 --> 03:44:50.590]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[03:44:50.709 --> 03:45:00.889]  If you really want to support us and hang on the wall and know you supported the Second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[03:45:01.129 --> 03:45:02.870]  Regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:04.309]  You're going to want to order again.
[03:45:04.610 --> 03:45:06.750]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[03:45:06.930 --> 03:45:08.190]  I'm suing the deep state.
[03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:09.149]  We're going after them.
[03:45:09.250 --> 03:45:15.270]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:16.729]  We're going to win this thing.
[03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:20.489]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[03:45:20.610 --> 03:45:30.049]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[03:45:32.019 --> 03:45:34.040]  TheAlexJonesStore.com Thank you so much for your support.
