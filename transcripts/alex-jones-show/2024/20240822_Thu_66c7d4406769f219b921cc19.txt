[00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:26.719]  Revelation 12 verse 3 presents us with another threatening sign in the heavens.
[00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:36.523]  A mighty dragon of fiery red color, identified as Satan, having seven heads and ten horns, and on each head a royal crown or diadem.
[00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:45.088]  In the context of Revelation 12, the red dragon displays seven heads and ten horns, with seven diadems adorning the heads.
[00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:49.490]  The horns denote strength, and the crowns signify dominion.
[00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:55.376]  No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from moving ahead.
[00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:58.938]  The projections are that by 2050, that that 70% or the 60% is now with the G7, that 70% will be 35%.
[00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:00.318]  China and India together
[00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.650]  We're good to go.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.062]  It was said that this might be delayed for a year or two.
[00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.225]  But this year, God has pulled off a little trick, right?
[00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:52.029]  God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world.
[00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:53.230]  We still have 4,000 dead, right?
[00:01:54.711 --> 00:02:02.537]  But if 4,000 Chinese die versus 220,000 in the United States, we haven't really lost a single person, have we?
[00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:07.161]  In 2012, we achieved absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:07.821]  and Japan.
[00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.204]  We have gained absolute superiority over the U.S.
[00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:11.964]  military.
[00:02:12.145 --> 00:02:16.908]  And we are expanding our military at a rate unprecedented in human history.
[00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:21.031]  As long as we go to work every day, we will drive the U.S.
[00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:22.092]  to its death.
[00:02:22.653 --> 00:02:23.853]  Globalists, man, they are...
[00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:30.797]  They teach at the Army and Marine Corps training centers that America must merge with China for world peace.
[00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:35.320]  You know, I feel like a great weight has been lifted off of me now that we're openly in world government.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.525]  It's openly anti-human, openly anti-family, openly anti-small business, and completely satanic.
[00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:45.566]  We were right.
[00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:46.746]  We weren't wrong.
[00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.587]  I'm very sad.
[00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:48.707]  I'm very disgusted.
[00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:51.209]  But it is said in the Book of Revelation that
[00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.062]  John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos marveled at the beast.
[00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:12.118]  John the Revelator wrote the Book of the Seven Seas.
[00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:20.021]  Looking forward through an interdimensional wormhole that God opened up to show him, the Antichrist and the world government, what would be happening in the future.
[00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.462]  He marveled at the beast.
[00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:26.744]  World government cannot buy nor sell without a mark on the forehead or the hand.
[00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:29.025]  You must turn over your children to the state.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.706]  You must destroy your very genetics, you must kill the Earth, you must worship Satan, or you will not be allowed to live.
[00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:37.828]  You will not be allowed to have a job.
[00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:49.359]  Well, whether you believe John was the greatest science fiction writer ever 2,000 years ago, or whether you believe he was inspired by God, it's being manifested.
[00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.824]  It's being set up right now.
[00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:57.558]  I believe...
[00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:25.170]  Persuasively, that the book of Revelation was written before the fall of Jerusalem.
[00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.733]  In the 60s, during the time of Nero.
[00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:36.217]  When Nero's most famous nickname throughout the empire was the Beast.
[00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:40.179]  The old Chinese proverb says, may you live in interesting times.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.861]  And we certainly are interesting times.
[00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.963]  And then you have the battle of Armageddon with the dragon.
[00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:50.266]  All the rest of it now unfolding.
[00:04:52.067 --> 00:05:06.750]  So, get your popcorn out, because you got front row seats to the big finale.
[00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:14.271]  74 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 20 seconds for the most important election in world history.
[00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.612]  And then if Trump can make it past all the fraud, if we can beat him,
[00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.434]  Another 79 days of hell while he's president-elect.
[00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:25.360]  150 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, 5 seconds until the inauguration of President Donald Trump as the 47th president.
[00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:35.898]  It is Thursday, August 22nd, 2024.
[00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:45.886]  I am your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting from the embattled, battle-hardened studios in Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:47.928]  We are the voice of free humanity.
[00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:49.689]  We are the resistance.
[00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.234]  We have another massively important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:58.544]  Let me tell you some of the news coming up.
[00:05:58.604 --> 00:06:04.445]  And of course, there'll be breaking news and a bunch of extremely informative, provocative guests today.
[00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:07.046]  All right.
[00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:08.967]  We knew this was coming.
[00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:20.230]  And of course, I predicted this at nauseam in the three days after the attempted Trump assassination on July 13th.
[00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.011]  And then sure enough, they came out and did exactly what I said they would do.
[00:06:24.747 --> 00:06:31.935]  And I said if they kept beating the drum for it, that they were definitely going to try to kill Trump again, another assassination attempt, and frame Iran.
[00:06:32.896 --> 00:06:35.338]  Well, now it's AP, Reuters, Newsmax, everywhere.
[00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:42.686]  Iran wants Trump eliminated by Election Day, says multiple government sources associated with U.S.
[00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:46.270]  allies across the Mideast have informed them of the danger.
[00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:59.026]  You've got Trump walking right into the trap when Netanyahu was here a few weeks ago in his address to Congress, saying that Iran wants to kill Trump.
[00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:00.747]  Iran said, no, we don't.
[00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:05.908]  They had some fake bust of supposedly Iranian hired hitmen.
[00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:12.530]  And Trump goes onto his social and says, if I'm killed, wipe Iran off the map.
[00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:17.012]  So he's just greenlit, red carpeted,
[00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:30.940]  The deep state to kill him as the pretext to launch a giant new war on the back of Trump being killed.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.503]  And then you're not patriotic if you don't support vaporizing Iran.
[00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:37.125]  Absolutely insane.
[00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:43.430]  I shot a special report right before we went live with my predictions and the background documents.
[00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.491]  That should be done in the next 30-40 minutes.
[00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.473]  We'll premiere that here on air.
[00:07:48.013 --> 00:07:50.155]  I'm going to table that massive news until then.
[00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:59.374]  Also, we have the Democrats in Next Level Lying, which is hard to say.
[00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:00.695]  They could even turn it up more.
[00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:02.056]  It's like Spinal Tap.
[00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:03.197]  Well, why does the knob go to 11?
[00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:05.279]  Just make it louder when it goes to 10.
[00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:05.899]  Well, because it's 11.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.623]  This is like a 12 on the Richter scale.
[00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:17.288]  We have Senator Chris Murphy, who's one of the most evil people in government.
[00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.931]  And we have the so-called Bexar County Sheriff.
[00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:33.836]  Up there last night at the DNC Rat Clown Convention, saying Kamala Harris was super hard on the border and did an incredible job.
[00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:37.698]  So first she was the border czar and did a great job.
[00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:38.758]  She did a terrible job.
[00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:40.139]  Then she was never the border czar.
[00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.381]  Now she is the border czar and did an incredible job.
[00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:48.863]  Lies within frauds, within spin, within garbage, within gaslighting.
[00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:50.524]  That's coming up.
[00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:51.902]  With the clips.
[00:08:52.762 --> 00:09:00.148]  And we have the same sheriff on TV two years ago saying Kamala Harris won't come to the border and the border is a complete hellhole.
[00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:02.950]  But I guess the check cleared.
[00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:09.916]  Now he's at the DNC saying she did a masterful job.
[00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:12.578]  We have that little stacky wacky.
[00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:22.314]  That ties into California to give 0% down payment home loans for illegals, but not for citizens.
[00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:24.817]  Ah, that's not discriminatory.
[00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.721]  That's not bait for new Democrat voters.
[00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.646]  And then we have this incredible stack.
[00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:37.341]  We've known the jobless numbers that Biden's been putting out for three and a half years have been fake.
[00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.702]  It keeps coming out, they're fake.
[00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:42.524]  And now the federal agency over that said that's just not true.
[00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:47.967]  800 plus thousand jobs they claim they created, they didn't create.
[00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:52.189]  The biggest downgrade in jobs numbers that's basically ever happened.
[00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.693]  And then the head of the federal department over that
[00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:00.449]  We're good to go.
[00:10:31.203 --> 00:10:33.344]  When are you coming out with electric F-150s?
[00:10:34.564 --> 00:10:35.945]  He said, what's an F-150?
[00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:39.106]  That'd be like the head of General Motors.
[00:10:43.368 --> 00:10:46.249]  And they said, are you coming out with an electric Suburban?
[00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.051]  And the head of General Motors said, what's a Suburban?
[00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:59.235]  That'd be like asking Jerry Jones whether he's planning to
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.861]  Sell the Cowboys, and Jerry Jones says, what's the Cowboys?
[00:11:09.142 --> 00:11:12.102]  A third of that department is that department.
[00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:15.423]  That'd be like, I've been living in the same house for nine years.
[00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:24.745]  And that'd be like, if I showed up at home at night, and my wife said, I've made dinner, let's go wash your hands, take a shower, whatever, and dinner's ready in 10 minutes.
[00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:25.685]  And I said,
[00:11:27.883 --> 00:11:30.164]  What's the dining room?
[00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:31.525]  Or what's dinner?
[00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:37.388]  The magnitude of this.
[00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:41.229]  Again, whoever they say is the head of an agency is an idiot on purpose.
[00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:46.211]  Biden, Harris, Fetterman, you know, is the senator.
[00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:50.513]  They want, just like I said, the head of the Secret Service was not running anything.
[00:11:50.533 --> 00:11:50.993]  Total moron.
[00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:52.694]  I said, whoever the deputy is, that's the bad guy.
[00:11:52.974 --> 00:11:54.315]  Boom, he was the guy running the standout.
[00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.037]  Ronald Roe.
[00:11:56.797 --> 00:11:57.678]  I've learned how they work.
[00:11:58.999 --> 00:11:59.760]  So, U.S.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.282]  added fewer jobs in the past year than initially reported.
[00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:03.743]  Even NPR admits that.
[00:12:05.464 --> 00:12:06.405]  Fox News, U.S.
[00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:11.569]  economy created 818,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
[00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:13.591]  The agency says U.S.
[00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:16.433]  jobs revised down 818,000 in election year.
[00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:16.853]  Shocker.
[00:12:17.534 --> 00:12:18.735]  Second worst revision in history.
[00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:19.175]  I looked into it.
[00:12:19.195 --> 00:12:19.816]  It's actually the worst.
[00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:24.898]  Biden-Harris artificial job numbers exposed following largest jobs revision.
[00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:31.101]  Trump accuses Biden and men of massive scandal after new jobs numbers dramatically revised downward.
[00:12:31.141 --> 00:12:31.921]  Fox News again.
[00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:36.543]  Secretary of Commerce says she's not familiar with the Bureau of Labor.
[00:12:41.325 --> 00:12:44.146]  The Secretary of Commerce doesn't know what the Department of Labor is.
[00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:49.589]  That is the most important section of the Department of Commerce.
[00:12:53.971 --> 00:13:02.177]  That'd be like cops, if you asked a police chief, what is a handgun?
[00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.219]  And the police chief said, what is a gun?
[00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:12.905]  Or if you asked a lumberjack, what kind of chainsaw are you using?
[00:13:14.626 --> 00:13:15.327]  A chain what?
[00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:19.550]  It'd be like asking an angler,
[00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:25.702]  It'd be like asking a fisherman, what is a fishing pole?
[00:13:26.922 --> 00:13:28.143]  Or what is a hook?
[00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:30.023]  Or what is a line?
[00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:32.464]  Or what is a reel?
[00:13:33.244 --> 00:13:37.265]  It'd be like asking a captain, well what, tell us about the tonnage of this ship.
[00:13:38.305 --> 00:13:39.025]  Where was it made?
[00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:39.745]  How old is it?
[00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:42.426]  How powerful are the engines?
[00:13:42.646 --> 00:13:43.867]  How many knots can you go here?
[00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:47.287]  And the captain goes, excuse me, well what's a ship?
[00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.148]  Alright, I'm gonna get back into that.
[00:13:50.444 --> 00:13:54.666]  But that is the level of the ding-dong-ness of these people.
[00:13:57.588 --> 00:13:58.448]  And it gets crazier.
[00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.612]  Now, this is a whitewash because they know they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:13.936]  And I've made films and written articles on this and had top toxicologists and scientists on.
[00:14:15.777 --> 00:14:15.937]  But...
[00:14:17.472 --> 00:14:20.058]  The 1.3 to 1.6, they vary, that they put in the water supply.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.141]  Is double what they suggested at the end of 1945.
[00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:33.703]  They had it in the water about 47 and about 60% of the country, now it's 70% up to 80.
[00:14:34.724 --> 00:14:36.284]  Most countries don't do it, which is too ridiculous.
[00:14:36.884 --> 00:14:39.986]  But it's not just calcium fluoride that you actually need a little bit of, it's good for you in small amounts.
[00:14:40.386 --> 00:14:47.929]  It's hydrofluorosilicic that's very active in an acid form and usually in a toxic waste base that they dump in the water.
[00:14:49.209 --> 00:14:51.630]  AP reports, overhead shot please.
[00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:54.231]  US report.
[00:14:56.297 --> 00:15:00.238]  Says fluoride is likely to lower IQ in kids.
[00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:01.959]  Wow.
[00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.119]  Just came out last night, August 21st.
[00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:05.620]  It's August 22nd.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.061]  Doesn't just do that.
[00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:14.562]  Increases cancer massively.
[00:15:14.762 --> 00:15:17.143]  Brain cancer, bone cancer, you name it.
[00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:24.185]  Attacks ovaries, attacks testicles like fire burns down forests.
[00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:28.660]  A big, big deal.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.860]  But see, they're moving on from the flora.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.241]  They've got the clot shots now that eat your brain a lot faster.
[00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:38.742]  They now admit the highest increase in dementia ever recorded.
[00:15:39.762 --> 00:15:45.443]  Multi-thousand points above dementia being reported four years ago, and they're blaming COVID for it.
[00:15:45.783 --> 00:15:48.164]  Though in the statistics, it's the people that took the shots.
[00:15:48.744 --> 00:15:49.024]  Yeah.
[00:15:50.344 --> 00:15:54.445]  They gave you a synthetic form of spongiform encephalopathy.
[00:15:55.513 --> 00:15:58.875]  Or, mad cow disease.
[00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:01.336]  That's mainstream news.
[00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.856]  Government admission today.
[00:16:03.056 --> 00:16:04.057]  I have that in the stacking.
[00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:07.278]  Very nice people we have running things.
[00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:12.200]  Life expectancy is plunging, fertility is plunging, IQ is plunging.
[00:16:16.502 --> 00:16:17.783]  I looked it up, depending on the cancer.
[00:16:19.147 --> 00:16:25.732]  Cancer in children is up several hundred thousand times because in the 50s, if a kid had cancer, people would get on airplanes.
[00:16:25.772 --> 00:16:27.493]  Doctors would fly across the country to see it.
[00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:28.554]  It just didn't happen.
[00:16:29.414 --> 00:16:32.577]  Now you go to the mall, you might see 10% of the kids with shaved heads.
[00:16:33.277 --> 00:16:41.503]  You'll even see them with, you know, you see bulging under their shirt, the chemotherapy injection packs.
[00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:43.545]  You know what you're looking for?
[00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:46.943]  And they're just saying the kids are dying all over the place.
[00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:48.624]  It's so liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[00:16:48.844 --> 00:16:51.246]  And they're having strokes and heart attacks in a major study.
[00:16:51.626 --> 00:17:06.035]  Harvard NIH study with the British Medical System, British Medical Journal, came out last week and said, yes, all increase in heart attacks and myocarditis didn't basically exist in children before.
[00:17:06.395 --> 00:17:06.855]  Very rare.
[00:17:07.175 --> 00:17:08.496]  It's all from the shot.
[00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:09.977]  For just a little, yeah, we did it to you.
[00:17:12.418 --> 00:17:13.718]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:17:13.818 --> 00:17:15.979]  A little bit of liberal love for you there?
[00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:19.740]  Now, when you go to a Democrat event, you see these mutants.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.241]  They can be white, black, Hispanic.
[00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:23.702]  They're the people that fell to this.
[00:17:25.882 --> 00:17:28.623]  They weren't strong enough, but it's hurting all of us.
[00:17:30.624 --> 00:17:32.845]  Ooh, lordy, lordy, lordy.
[00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.305]  U.S.
[00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:34.765]  report, AP, U.S.
[00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:35.245]  government.
[00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:36.406]  The U.S.
[00:17:36.426 --> 00:17:39.967]  government report expected to stir debate.
[00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:44.032]  Isn't that cute?
[00:17:48.638 --> 00:17:49.339]  And that's sweet.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.502]  The National Toxology Program.
[00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.545]  300 plus page report.
[00:17:56.227 --> 00:17:56.447]  Hmm.
[00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.331]  Put out by the
[00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:04.457]  FDA and CDC all in consultation.
[00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:05.838]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:07.599]  Nice people.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.622]  Such nice people.
[00:18:10.662 --> 00:18:12.683]  They love your children so much.
[00:18:13.123 --> 00:18:23.731]  That's why they were performing abortions while the Catholic Cardinal was speaking at the DNC.
[00:18:26.633 --> 00:18:27.394]  Isn't that cute?
[00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:36.504]  Long-term risk of autoimmune disease after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in Korea.
[00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:40.065]  Nationwide population-based cohort study.
[00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:42.826]  Yeah, there's thousands of them now.
[00:18:44.886 --> 00:18:55.709]  Passes the blood-brain barrier and starts replicating in your brain, in your heart, in your arteries, in your veins, in your capillaries, in your lungs, in your kidneys, in everything.
[00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:05.927]  Well, I mean, there's too many people Bill Gates talks about wants to get rid of the population, but he loves you and wants you to take a shot because he cares about you so much.
[00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:13.215]  He cares about killing you so much, and he thinks you're too weak-minded to admit this is being done to you.
[00:19:14.316 --> 00:19:16.439]  So I've kind of set the table a little bit here.
[00:19:16.859 --> 00:19:18.921]  Now, since I mentioned all these stories,
[00:19:20.362 --> 00:19:25.085]  Do you really think just talking about how Tim Walz is an admitted communist Chinese spy is important?
[00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:31.228]  I mean, it is, but it's just par for the course, or all the other insane lies.
[00:19:31.248 --> 00:19:35.330]  Yeah, they got all these spin articles.
[00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.913]  Yeah, myocarditis risk from COVID-19 vaccines are still less than the risk from COVID-19, and that's not true.
[00:19:41.993 --> 00:19:44.234]  So first, the shot protected you, and there are no side effects.
[00:19:44.274 --> 00:19:46.936]  Now it doesn't protect you, and well, there's side effects, but they're not that bad.
[00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:52.436]  When you actually read the real studies, it's, no, it's, it's, it's the shots.
[00:19:54.077 --> 00:19:56.138]  But see, these people don't want to admit they were wrong.
[00:19:56.198 --> 00:20:13.651]  They have a learned helplessness Stockholm syndrome, where it's too scary for them to admit their mommy government is giving them fluoride or aspartame they couldn't get approved in the 70s, because Searle that owned it tested it on rhesus monkeys and it killed almost all the babies they gave it to in their milk.
[00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:16.754]  But then Donald Rumsfeld got Ronald Reagan to approve it.
[00:20:16.994 --> 00:20:18.335]  You know what aspartame does to your brain?
[00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:25.832]  Look at these BS headlines from Yahoo!
[00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:57.456]  90 plus percent of the dead were from the shots.
[00:20:59.217 --> 00:20:59.997]  But I'm digressing.
[00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:11.903]  There's a good write-up that I saw on X from Donald Trump Jr.
[00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:14.004]  that Glenn Beck posted.
[00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:18.309]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than inflation.
[00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:20.830]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than open borders.
[00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.993]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than fentanyl and drugs on the streets.
[00:21:24.013 --> 00:21:26.835]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than our children being killed by illegals.
[00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:30.298]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the homelessness epidemic.
[00:21:30.318 --> 00:21:33.320]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the abortion cult of death.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.282]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the possibility of nuclear war.
[00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:40.165]  That's what a vote for Kamala Harris is actually all about.
[00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:42.267]  And J.D.
[00:21:42.327 --> 00:21:44.729]  Vance did a really excellent job with Tapper, I'm going to play.
[00:21:47.947 --> 00:21:50.008]  We're good to go.
[00:22:08.134 --> 00:22:17.822]  And the Globals are trying to get him to sell and they also had some of the head bankers on board when the boat that the maker of it said was unsinkable blew up and they claimed in a clear blue sky a tornado killed him.
[00:22:18.642 --> 00:22:22.566]  No, they blew, I guess a tornado made the other co-owner die in a car wreck a few days before.
[00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:27.530]  I first learned about that over the weekend.
[00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.411]  Joe Rogan sent me a link, I guess on Monday.
[00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:32.694]  And I've got a really important report on that I want to get to.
[00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:39.133]  But we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes and come back and get into Iran wants Trump eliminated by election day.
[00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:48.461]  Because that really is the big demon in the room, the devil in the room.
[00:22:48.741 --> 00:22:54.286]  And it is 100% clear signal that they're going to try to kill Trump, blame Iran.
[00:22:54.346 --> 00:23:00.632]  And it makes perfect sense that they could then blame a foreign power, blow them up, tell you're not patriotic if you don't get in line.
[00:23:01.795 --> 00:23:28.231]  And I was permeating and calculating and computing in my mind when they shot Trump on July 13th what they would do, and then the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and then the feds came out and said the next day after that, I said, they're going to try to blame this on Iran, they're going to say a new assassination is coming from Iran, they may blow up Mar-a-Lago with a truck bomb and say Iran did it, and I give a bunch of other examples, and then sure as hell they came out and said, oh we just arrested somebody planning to bomb or shoot up Mar-a-Lago, he's an Iranian agent.
[00:23:30.345 --> 00:23:31.526]  People ask, how do I do that?
[00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:32.226]  It's real simple.
[00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:33.947]  They want to attack Iran.
[00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:35.908]  Trump did stuff to Iran.
[00:23:36.709 --> 00:23:39.110]  And that's just a simple, pretty simple, actually.
[00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.151]  And then they did it.
[00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:42.052]  And now they're back saying, oh, it's certain.
[00:23:43.032 --> 00:23:46.954]  The Ayatollah has ordered him killed by Election Day.
[00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:52.938]  I said, when they do this, you know they're going for him again.
[00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:54.018]  Boom.
[00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:54.659]  Bingo.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.261]  Like a fine Swiss watch to the second.
[00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:00.598]  So we're going to go over that.
[00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:08.521]  Please remember, I am risking my life and everything I've got to fight these people because I believe in you and I believe we can beat them because God's on our side.
[00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:13.783]  But we've got to have courage, we've got to have strength, we've got to have will, we've got to have energy, we've got to have the truth, and we've got to have the support.

[00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:23.533]  That is the disinformation being put out.
[00:28:23.873 --> 00:28:25.154]  I told you this signal was coming.
[00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:27.535]  This is a maximum alert.
[00:28:27.575 --> 00:28:28.416]  Do you understand me?
[00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:29.837]  This is not a Netflix show.
[00:28:30.137 --> 00:28:31.878]  This is not a Star Wars show with Disney.
[00:28:32.118 --> 00:28:33.259]  This is not entertainment.
[00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.380]  This isn't a video game.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.961]  This is the real world, okay?
[00:28:36.701 --> 00:28:38.422]  Okay, I want everybody to understand that.
[00:28:38.463 --> 00:28:39.703]  This is not a freaking game.
[00:28:40.204 --> 00:28:41.085]  This isn't a joke.
[00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:44.287]  I don't just say this stuff for fun or to scare people.
[00:28:44.888 --> 00:28:45.688]  This is reality.
[00:28:46.769 --> 00:28:51.613]  Are you ready for them to blow his head off or blow his plane up or bomb Mar-a-Lago and blame Iran?
[00:28:51.693 --> 00:28:55.476]  Are you ready to wake up in the morning in a month and Trump's dead?
[00:28:56.317 --> 00:28:57.137]  Are you ready for that?
[00:28:58.098 --> 00:28:58.939]  And the U.S.
[00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:00.300]  government's bombing Iran with Israel.
[00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.572]  And the Deep State uses that to set up martial law.
[00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.554]  And they activate all the Islamic sleeper cells around the country.
[00:29:11.257 --> 00:29:13.798]  Because when the West does attack Iran, they will activate them.
[00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:17.481]  And then the Globalists use that crisis for permanent martial law.
[00:29:18.482 --> 00:29:20.683]  Do you hear me, everybody?
[00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:23.465]  This is a big deal.
[00:29:24.046 --> 00:29:25.847]  You might want to get concerned about it.
[00:29:26.387 --> 00:29:28.249]  It's not just one more little piece of news.
[00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:42.158]  Now the globalists have all of these completely incompetent people as the heads of agencies, and then behind them are the real operators at the second, third, fourth, fifth level.
[00:29:43.679 --> 00:30:02.672]  They want to have complete airheads like Biden or Kamala Harris, complete morons, like the former head of the Secret Service, her deputy, Ronald Rowe, was the real guy running things, so they have plausible deniability when the idiot gets asked questions or testifies, and they can blame anything they want on them.
[00:30:04.198 --> 00:30:05.319]  So, overhead shot please.
[00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:11.703]  We have Gina Rinaldo, the head of the Secretary of Commerce.
[00:30:13.084 --> 00:30:31.356]  She's the Secretary of Commerce, and she's on ABC News saying that she doesn't know what the Bureau of Labor is, even though that's the biggest section of the Department of Commerce.
[00:30:32.357 --> 00:30:33.377]  Now, as I said earlier,
[00:30:34.315 --> 00:30:40.879]  That's like Jerry Jones, if he's asked, how are the Cowboys going to do this season?
[00:30:41.719 --> 00:30:43.481]  And he says, what is the Cowboys?
[00:30:44.821 --> 00:30:48.163]  Or if you ask Elvis Presley, what's your favorite rock and roll?
[00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:50.065]  He says, I don't know what rock and roll is.
[00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:57.169]  Or that'd be like walking into a steak restaurant and saying, I would like to order a ribeye.
[00:30:58.168 --> 00:30:59.809]  And they look at you and say, what is a ribeye?
[00:30:59.869 --> 00:31:01.170]  And you go, okay, what's a T-bone?
[00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.131]  We don't know what that is either.
[00:31:02.451 --> 00:31:03.431]  What's a filet mignon?
[00:31:03.732 --> 00:31:04.212]  We don't know.
[00:31:04.252 --> 00:31:05.353]  What's a chateaubriand?
[00:31:05.393 --> 00:31:05.973]  We don't know.
[00:31:07.274 --> 00:31:09.796]  What's a, okay, what's a New York strip?
[00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:10.776]  We don't know what that is either.
[00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:16.760]  It's like going to a dairy farm and asking the farmer, what type of cow do you have?
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.981]  Is it a Holstein?
[00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:20.082]  Is it a Jersey cow?
[00:31:20.463 --> 00:31:23.565]  And they say, we don't know what cows are.
[00:31:27.017 --> 00:31:37.324]  So with a straight face, she's confronted with 818,000 less jobs, one of the biggest cooking in the books ever by any administration.
[00:31:38.525 --> 00:31:40.346]  They're arguing whether it's the biggest or the second biggest.
[00:31:40.926 --> 00:31:41.687]  Total fraud.
[00:31:42.387 --> 00:31:48.812]  And she goes on, in the full interview, which I've got here, I'm going to play a clip, to say, oh, I think Trump's making that up.
[00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:52.174]  I don't even know what the Bureau of Labor Statistics is.
[00:31:58.493 --> 00:31:58.993]  There's Fox News.
[00:31:59.013 --> 00:32:03.155]  Again, that's like asking a police chief, what type of firearms do your officers carry?
[00:32:03.315 --> 00:32:06.996]  And the police chief says, I don't know what a firearm is.
[00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:11.238]  That's like asking a firefighter,
[00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:31.047]  What type of axe do you use?
[00:32:31.127 --> 00:32:32.669]  And they go, we don't know what an axe is.
[00:32:32.689 --> 00:32:34.310]  All right, I'm going to stop there.
[00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.193]  This is next level Bozo the Clown stuff.
[00:32:39.474 --> 00:32:42.957]  You say, oh, well, she's just diverting and trying to, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:44.678]  She's the head of the agency.
[00:32:44.698 --> 00:32:45.238]  She's an idiot.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.641]  She literally just gets a paycheck and bumbles around.
[00:32:48.661 --> 00:32:50.102]  They just put women in all positions.
[00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:51.263]  It's like, oh, it's a woman.
[00:32:51.283 --> 00:32:52.004]  That's not threatening.
[00:32:52.024 --> 00:32:53.285]  You know, you can't criticize a woman.
[00:32:54.766 --> 00:32:57.528]  She may even be dumber than Kamala Harris.
[00:32:57.928 --> 00:32:58.409]  Here she is.
[00:32:59.502 --> 00:33:04.249]  When you hear that, do you potentially think that this new numbers could be a liability for this campaign?
[00:33:04.409 --> 00:33:09.997]  No, when I hear that, first of all, I don't believe it, because I've never heard Donald Trump say anything truthful.
[00:33:10.017 --> 00:33:11.499]  It is, though, from the Bureau of Labor.
[00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:14.023]  I don't, I'm not familiar with that.
[00:33:15.612 --> 00:33:15.892]  Okay.
[00:33:16.693 --> 00:33:18.374]  Well, she's not familiar with that.
[00:33:19.154 --> 00:33:22.156]  So they need you to hate Trump more than inflation.
[00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:24.378]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than open borders.
[00:33:24.398 --> 00:33:30.702]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than fentanyl and drugs on the streets and drag queen storytime or the crime waves.
[00:33:30.722 --> 00:33:34.265]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than our children being killed by illegals.
[00:33:34.605 --> 00:33:37.046]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the homeless epidemic.
[00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:41.549]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the election cult, the abortion cult of death.
[00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.052]  They need you to hate Donald Trump more than the possibility of nuclear war.
[00:33:45.832 --> 00:33:48.754]  That's what a vote for Kamala Harris is actually about, wrote Glenn Beck.
[00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:49.754]  I added a few things in there.
[00:33:51.836 --> 00:33:54.317]  I want you to hate Donald Trump more than the inflation that he valued.
[00:33:54.357 --> 00:33:54.737]  Dollar.
[00:33:57.179 --> 00:33:57.479]  All of it.
[00:33:57.899 --> 00:33:59.460]  He's just the excuse to do all this.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.982]  So, let's look at Gina Raimondo and what she said.
[00:34:04.448 --> 00:34:10.391]  Biden Commerce Secretary Raimondo dismisses job creation discrepancy in a full interview.
[00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:12.412]  I've got transcripts here, you can read it.
[00:34:12.812 --> 00:34:14.353]  She just said, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:34:14.373 --> 00:34:15.853]  I don't know what the Department of Labor is.
[00:34:18.435 --> 00:34:22.817]  Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo suggests Trump made up numbers that Biden's Labor Department released.
[00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:25.858]  U.S.
[00:34:25.978 --> 00:34:28.380]  adds fewer jobs in the past year than initially reported.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:28.460]  NPR.
[00:34:30.567 --> 00:34:30.687]  U.S.
[00:34:30.707 --> 00:34:34.710]  jobs created 818,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
[00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.391]  That's in all mainstream news.
[00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:39.113]  But she doesn't care about that.
[00:34:39.513 --> 00:34:40.514]  It's Donald Trump.
[00:34:42.915 --> 00:34:45.397]  Be like, hey, you didn't feed your baby for a week and it died.
[00:34:46.297 --> 00:34:51.641]  Donald Trump, you didn't go to work for a month and sat around injecting heroin.
[00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:54.463]  Donald Trump, you murdered your neighbors.
[00:34:54.543 --> 00:34:57.345]  Donald Trump, you
[00:34:59.278 --> 00:35:00.458]  Or walking around naked in the street.
[00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:01.099]  Donald Trump.
[00:35:02.799 --> 00:35:03.400]  Donald Trump.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.020]  Donald Trump.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.620]  Donald Trump.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.220]  Donald Trump.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.962]  I mean, are you sick of how bad the economy is?
[00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:08.702]  Yeah!
[00:35:08.762 --> 00:35:10.623]  Well then, beat Donald Trump.
[00:35:11.003 --> 00:35:11.803]  I'm Kamala Harris.
[00:35:11.863 --> 00:35:12.423]  I'll fix it.
[00:35:12.824 --> 00:35:14.684]  He's been in power for almost four years.
[00:35:16.785 --> 00:35:20.927]  Trump accuses Biden administration of massive scandal that renewed jobs numbers dramatically revised downward.
[00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:22.428]  Their response is?
[00:35:24.508 --> 00:35:25.269]  I don't believe that.
[00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:27.430]  I don't know what that agency is.
[00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.230]  I'm just over it.
[00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:46.175]  A fifth grader could be given one day's instruction, or hell, an hour's instruction, on that department and what is under it, and could answer a 10-question test and get an A+.
[00:35:46.815 --> 00:35:48.857]  A fifth grader, just an average fifth grader.
[00:35:49.878 --> 00:35:55.223]  So, the head of that agency, the Department of Commerce, is
[00:35:56.929 --> 00:35:58.310]  Less informed than a fifth grader.
[00:35:58.691 --> 00:36:00.012]  And that's how they want it.
[00:36:00.132 --> 00:36:06.817]  They don't want anybody informed and charged because they can do whatever they want right under their noses.
[00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:10.581]  And the Justice Department lets them commit all these crimes, insider training.
[00:36:13.343 --> 00:36:19.148]  And then focuses all their time on harassing and going after
[00:36:22.236 --> 00:36:23.917]  Conservatives and populists and good people.
[00:36:24.497 --> 00:36:27.119]  We'll get into the big story here in a moment, but this is huge as well.
[00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:30.081]  We're ready on the Iran news here in a few minutes.
[00:36:30.862 --> 00:36:33.603]  We'll also be posting it on X, but wait, I'm going to give you a headline at the end of the hour.
[00:36:33.623 --> 00:36:34.884]  I want to give it a really powerful headline.
[00:36:36.125 --> 00:36:36.805]  It's really important.
[00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:46.612]  So you just saw the whopper where the head of the Department of Commerce doesn't know what the Bureau of Labor Statistics is.
[00:36:46.932 --> 00:36:48.013]  Jobs and Labor Statistics.
[00:36:48.733 --> 00:36:50.014]  That's the largest part of that agency.
[00:36:51.087 --> 00:36:52.047]  Well, there's four parts to it.
[00:36:53.628 --> 00:37:00.450]  So, now we have Senator Chris Murray claims Kamala has been tough as nails on border security.
[00:37:01.271 --> 00:37:07.493]  They blocked, was in the law and funded the DNA testing of people that clearly were there without any evidence that these were their kids.
[00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:09.974]  Took a day to do the test, very inexpensive.
[00:37:10.414 --> 00:37:16.176]  You can tell how many removed they are, whether it's a first cousin, third cousin, mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle.
[00:37:19.554 --> 00:37:29.160]  They brought in millions, you know, 20-something million people, millions of underage kids, many of them are in slave labor, even the New York Times reported hundreds of thousands have disappeared, many of them in sex slavery.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:42.549]  But remember, she was the Border Czar, but only went to the border once for 30 minutes, then she wasn't the Border Czar the last few weeks, now she was the Border Czar and did an incredible job.
[00:37:42.569 --> 00:37:46.111]  If you're having trouble keeping up with that, well, that's their point.
[00:37:47.884 --> 00:37:53.247]  So we're going to play a clip of him and then we have the Texas Sheriff got up and condemned Trump for the border.
[00:37:54.528 --> 00:37:57.310]  But it turns out he'd attacked Kamala before for the border.
[00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.893]  I guess that's before he got a phone call, maybe a little cashy.
[00:38:03.394 --> 00:38:06.436]  But let's play Senator Chris Murray.
[00:38:10.378 --> 00:38:12.520]  That's Trump's oxygen.
[00:38:13.502 --> 00:38:13.722]  Right?
[00:38:13.762 --> 00:38:15.884]  People like Trump and J.D.
[00:38:15.924 --> 00:38:19.626]  Vance, they need it to survive in politics.
[00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:26.630]  People are saying that they're weird, that they're creepy, and they are weird, they are creepy.
[00:38:28.151 --> 00:38:31.854]  But even worse, they're weak.
[00:38:37.737 --> 00:38:39.639]  Kamala Harris is not weak.
[00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:47.094]  For 20 years, Kamala Harris has been tough as nails when it comes to securing our border.
[00:38:47.895 --> 00:38:52.859]  When she was a California prosecutor, she went after drug smugglers, human traffickers.
[00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:56.601]  She put 100 gang members away in a single sweep.
[00:38:58.563 --> 00:39:01.845]  Trump says that a safe nation can't be an immigrant nation.
[00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:05.488]  That's flat wrong, and Kamala Harris knows it.
[00:39:08.815 --> 00:39:14.580]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:39:15.301 --> 00:39:18.964]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:39:28.462 --> 00:39:29.663]  But I sent the crew to so many clubs.
[00:39:29.763 --> 00:39:30.563]  It's not their fault.
[00:39:30.583 --> 00:39:31.204]  We need more people.
[00:39:32.004 --> 00:39:35.006]  So, let's move on to the next one, then we'll get into the big story.
[00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:43.111]  This Texas sheriff condemned Trump on the border and praised Kamala Harris, said one of the Krasenstein creatures.
[00:39:44.172 --> 00:39:45.253]  Oh, that's Thing 1 or Thing 2.
[00:39:46.593 --> 00:39:47.554]  But here's the headline.
[00:39:47.634 --> 00:39:48.535]  Holy you know what?
[00:39:49.332 --> 00:40:00.138]  The Texas Sheriff, who just praised Kamala Harris at the DNC on border security, pleaded on television for the Biden-Harris administration to do something about the border crisis because nobody came down to the border.
[00:40:00.518 --> 00:40:01.678]  You can't make this up.
[00:40:01.698 --> 00:40:03.299]  So here he is on MSNBC.
[00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:12.184]  Javier Salazar was definitely either paid off or he has kiddie porn on his computer, says MJ Truth Ultra.
[00:40:13.004 --> 00:40:14.865]  Yeah, I think that's what's going on here.
[00:40:16.126 --> 00:40:17.987]  So, Sheriff Javier
[00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:27.565]  Salazar, Stonewall Democrats of San Antonio presents their whole LGBT thing.
[00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:33.889]  And we've got illegal aliens being turned away from the DNC for lack of ID at the wall.
[00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:42.413]  But let's go ahead and play first him on last night at the DNC there in the cesspit Chicago.
[00:40:43.414 --> 00:40:48.977]  And then let's move on to him a couple years ago complaining about Kamala Harris on MSNBC.
[00:40:50.643 --> 00:40:57.327]  When Donald Trump comes down to Texas, stands next to officers in uniforms just like mine, he's not there to help us.
[00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:58.708]  Don't think that.
[00:40:58.828 --> 00:40:59.669]  Not for a second.
[00:41:00.429 --> 00:41:02.610]  He is a self-serving man.
[00:41:08.534 --> 00:41:10.936]  I mean, look, just like when he killed the border bill.
[00:41:12.076 --> 00:41:13.337]  He just made our jobs harder.
[00:41:14.798 --> 00:41:19.261]  Now, Kamala, on the other hand, has been fighting border crime for years.
[00:41:20.939 --> 00:41:24.560]  She's gone down to Mexico and worked to stop the traffickers.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.041]  And when the traffickers didn't stop, she put them in jail.
[00:41:29.401 --> 00:41:33.322]  Now, down in my neck of the woods, we call that fooling around and finding out.
[00:41:35.523 --> 00:41:36.863]  I may be paraphrasing a bit.
[00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:40.684]  We protect them.
[00:41:40.744 --> 00:41:45.245]  Now, the border sheriffs that I know, right, and I, we're like Kamala.
[00:41:45.765 --> 00:41:46.666]  We protect and serve.
[00:41:47.386 --> 00:41:48.346]  We enforce the law.
[00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:50.744]  We show compassion.
[00:41:51.444 --> 00:41:53.425]  And we fight like hell to protect our border.
[00:41:54.065 --> 00:41:56.366]  Because that's all we've always known in Texas.
[00:41:56.826 --> 00:41:58.627]  Cuando luchamos, ganamos.
[00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:09.390]  When we fight, we win!
[00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.190]  Tell us about what you are asking for.
[00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:13.411]  What are your needs?
[00:42:14.997 --> 00:42:17.218]  Well, right now, thank you for having me first off.
[00:42:17.258 --> 00:42:31.006]  Right now, what I'm asking for is for the president or a member of his administration that can make decisions to come down and talk to not just me, but at least 12 other Texas sheriffs from major counties in the state of Texas that are dealing with this issue.
[00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:32.346]  First hand.
[00:42:32.807 --> 00:42:46.078]  So I'd like to see somebody from Washington come down here, get boots on the ground, get eyes on the issue at hand, and then talk to us, a bipartisan group of Texas sheriffs that are really taking a common sense approach because we have to.
[00:42:47.939 --> 00:42:50.642]  That is next level flip-flopping and BS.
[00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:52.383]  That's what these people do.
[00:42:53.764 --> 00:43:00.209]  Now, I'm going to issue an emergency alert right now that is of the highest level I've ever issued in 30 years.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.602]  The Deep State is going to try to kill Trump again, and they're going to try to frame Iran.
[00:43:07.362 --> 00:43:20.006]  And I said in the first few days after they grazed Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, that when they came out and said Iran was behind it and was going to try again, that would be the cover to kill Trump.
[00:43:21.132 --> 00:43:28.460]  In another assassination attempt, or another, they're going to try over and over again, and they would then use that to attack Iran.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:37.469]  Iran would then activate its sleeper cells of Hezbollah that are here, and that would bring America into martial law, which the globalists want.
[00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:42.494]  Use an outside enemy to unify the people under the unpopular, illegitimate government.
[00:43:43.956 --> 00:43:48.060]  They've now done that, and it's in AP, Reuters, New York Times, Washington Post, Newsmax.
[00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:48.701]  U.S.
[00:43:48.721 --> 00:43:55.248]  government officials and foreign government officials say the Islamic regime is trying to kill Trump and has assassination teams here in the United States.
[00:43:55.288 --> 00:44:05.840]  So, Deep State truck bombs Trump, Deep State blows up his plane, Deep State shoots him, and then they have an Iranian drugged up in the back of a truck to say that he did it, or a group of Iranians.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.321]  This is very simple.
[00:44:07.741 --> 00:44:09.022]  I'm not just saying this now.
[00:44:09.142 --> 00:44:10.123]  It's incredibly obvious.
[00:44:10.684 --> 00:44:18.110]  I'm saying it before all of this happened, and now it's following exactly what I said, because this is all I do, basically, is wargaming this information.
[00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:19.671]  So here's the emergency report.
[00:44:19.691 --> 00:44:20.912]  We're premiering here right now.
[00:44:20.932 --> 00:44:23.234]  We'll also post this on X very, very soon.
[00:44:23.274 --> 00:44:26.757]  Get it out like the future of the country and the world depends on it, because it does.
[00:44:27.178 --> 00:44:28.539]  Here it is, and I'll add some more points.
[00:44:29.312 --> 00:44:35.693]  With only 75 days left to the election, and the Deep State desperate, President Trump's life has never been in more danger.
[00:44:36.233 --> 00:44:37.134]  But not from Iran.
[00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:42.595]  The Deep State is preparing another attempt on President Trump's life.
[00:44:42.715 --> 00:44:48.376]  And this time, they're going to frame Iran for it.
[00:44:52.897 --> 00:44:53.677]  InfoWars.
[00:44:54.017 --> 00:44:55.657]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:44:57.238 --> 00:44:58.838]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.722]  President Trump's life is in serious danger.
[00:45:03.802 --> 00:45:10.647]  The deep state already tried to kill him and failed on July 13th of this year, just 40-something days ago.
[00:45:11.507 --> 00:45:20.013]  And two days after it happened, I came out and said, the deep state is going to try again and they're going to try to frame Iran.
[00:45:20.833 --> 00:45:23.595]  And now they are officially doing it.
[00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:28.458]  The big move is to hit him with a large truck bomb.
[00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:32.964]  Again, it's in the cards to use a small nuclear weapon and blame the Iranians.
[00:45:34.185 --> 00:45:35.146]  They'll be the fall guys.
[00:45:36.207 --> 00:45:38.088]  And then instantly, we're in full war with Russia.
[00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.891]  Instantly, the air raid sirens are going off.
[00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:43.093]  Instantly, life as you know it is over.
[00:45:43.113 --> 00:45:54.362]  And they're going to use the war to try to get Americans to, oh my God, you know, we got hit by a nuke, Iran, Iran, you know, with Russia, you know, and then everybody's off the air except the corporate news.
[00:45:56.289 --> 00:46:02.475]  Then you're going to see all hell break loose because there are people inside all those corporate news organizations and inside the government that are our people.
[00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:04.517]  Everyone's going to know it's the Deep State.
[00:46:04.537 --> 00:46:05.838]  They're not going to be able to blame it on Iran.
[00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:06.699]  That's who they're going to do it.
[00:46:07.559 --> 00:46:08.981]  That's who they're going to blame it on.
[00:46:09.041 --> 00:46:10.282]  And I know there are scenarios.
[00:46:11.803 --> 00:46:13.805]  And so it's not alarmist to say this.
[00:46:13.825 --> 00:46:17.929]  And I think we need to really get on the table out front to the globalists.
[00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:19.270]  We know your plans.
[00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.191]  We know your operations.
[00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:20.972]  We know your history.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.863]  And again, what do they do to get the sympathy back or to change the subject?
[00:46:25.943 --> 00:46:27.264]  Some horrible event.
[00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:33.408]  And again, if their next assassination attempt fails, if they're unable to poison him, that's the default.
[00:46:33.428 --> 00:46:34.449]  They're going to try to poison him.
[00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:48.018]  And if they can't get a shooter in, and if they can't get a truck bomb in close enough, if they put the barricades far enough back in Milwaukee, they're going to wait until he's back in Mar-a-Lago or somewhere and roll a truck bomb in there.
[00:46:48.479 --> 00:46:48.819]  Guaranteed.
[00:46:50.092 --> 00:46:51.514]  And say the Iranians did it.
[00:47:09.295 --> 00:47:13.960]  Over in Iran, the Ayatollah is trying to kill Trump and might have been involved.
[00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:17.243]  Oh, did the mullahs have the Secret Service stand down?
[00:47:17.864 --> 00:47:19.646]  Did they pull most of the security off?
[00:47:20.487 --> 00:47:29.095]  Did the mullahs have the Secret Service not point the man out on the roof for over 26 minutes or 90 minutes down below with a rangefinder and now we know a rifle?
[00:47:29.516 --> 00:47:31.998]  Man, those mullahs have magical powers!
[00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:48.156]  So now there's an article in Newsmax, similar propaganda everywhere, from conservative media we can trust, that, oh, absolutely, there's a big plot to kill Trump and the Ayatollah wants him dead before the election.
[00:47:48.656 --> 00:47:51.077]  I wonder who else wants him dead before the election.
[00:47:51.457 --> 00:47:58.159]  And Trump really fell into this trap when Netanyahu spoke to Congress a few weeks ago and said the Mullahs are going to try to kill Trump.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.861]  And Trump said on Truth Social, well, if they kill me, destroy Iran.
[00:48:03.476 --> 00:48:05.278]  They actually sent death squads.
[00:48:06.379 --> 00:48:12.184]  They sent death squads here to murder a former Secretary of State and a former National Security Advisor.
[00:48:12.845 --> 00:48:17.469]  And as we recently learned, they even brazenly threatened to assassinate President Trump.
[00:48:21.138 --> 00:48:27.185]  You have Homeland Security, you have the whole DHS, FBI, Secret Service system, fingerprints all over the attempted assassination.
[00:48:27.545 --> 00:48:28.967]  The deep state wants Trump gone.
[00:48:29.608 --> 00:48:34.213]  And now Israel's saying, well, if Trump gets killed, it's Iran's fault.
[00:48:34.253 --> 00:48:36.555]  And Trump goes, yeah, if I get killed, blow up Iran.
[00:48:37.296 --> 00:48:46.861]  President Trump, you're digging your own grave, inviting the deep state to kill you so they can attack Iran, keep you out of office, and clamp down on the American people.
[00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:49.383]  This is absolutely insane.
[00:48:49.723 --> 00:48:51.424]  It's not like I'm pointing this out now.
[00:48:52.664 --> 00:48:58.988]  I pointed it out before they even put out their propaganda because I study them and I'm many steps ahead of them.
[00:48:59.408 --> 00:49:02.850]  Again, if I hadn't even predicted this days before they started this,
[00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:05.859]  And you know, that's a little bit old, that chart.
[00:49:05.879 --> 00:49:07.701]  That chart's a couple of months old.
[00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:11.444]  And if you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:39.136]  And finally, Iran came out a month ago and said, we don't want Trump dead.
[00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:40.817]  We're not involved in your elections.
[00:49:41.158 --> 00:49:42.599]  We're not trying to assassinate him.
[00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:43.799]  We don't want war.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.661]  Israel just killed the two leaders of Hamas.
[00:49:47.161 --> 00:49:48.902]  Iran didn't even strike back.
[00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:51.244]  Iran is being very, very cautious.
[00:49:51.284 --> 00:49:52.284]  I'm not a fan of the mullahs.
[00:49:52.344 --> 00:49:54.446]  I'm just simply saying they understand
[00:49:55.046 --> 00:49:59.108]  That the globalists are about to blow them off the map and Trump could be the detonator.
[00:49:59.468 --> 00:50:00.808]  So this is a maximum alert.
[00:50:01.348 --> 00:50:03.929]  President Trump's life is in grave danger.
[00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:10.972]  And this is coming to you from the guy that first predicted they would try to assassinate President Trump going back several years ago.
[00:50:11.372 --> 00:50:12.893]  We've called it over and over again.
[00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:15.214]  The deep state's been caught trying to kill him.
[00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:18.255]  So now they're trying to sell the idea that the Iranians did it.
[00:50:19.104 --> 00:50:20.205]  You know they're going to try it again.
[00:50:20.825 --> 00:50:22.467]  They've already given us their cover story.
[00:50:22.787 --> 00:50:24.208]  Are we really this stupid to buy it?
[00:50:24.729 --> 00:50:27.391]  President Trump's life is in grave danger.
[00:50:41.832 --> 00:50:45.274]  Iran rejects accusation it was involved in plot to assassinate Trump.
[00:50:46.115 --> 00:50:49.317]  Iran rejects accusation it was involved in plot to assassinate Trump.
[00:50:50.758 --> 00:50:52.900]  This is the reality of where we are.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.542]  This is what's happening right now.
[00:50:58.504 --> 00:50:59.584]  They think you're stupid.
[00:51:00.205 --> 00:51:01.686]  They're putting out the cover story.
[00:51:01.966 --> 00:51:03.207]  They're going to try again.
[00:51:03.347 --> 00:51:07.330]  Trump walked into the trap on Truth Social saying if he's killed, blow Iran up.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.420]  Trump needs to get ahead of this.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.041]  It was not Iran tried to kill him.
[00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:13.342]  It was not Iran at the security stand down.
[00:51:13.402 --> 00:51:15.802]  It was the deep state and all that evidence is mounting.
[00:51:16.883 --> 00:51:18.643]  So please pray for President Trump.
[00:51:18.683 --> 00:51:19.423]  Pray for America.
[00:51:20.003 --> 00:51:23.204]  Understand the danger of this because again, they killed Trump.
[00:51:23.224 --> 00:51:24.105]  The deep state kills Trump.
[00:51:24.125 --> 00:51:24.885]  They blame Iran.
[00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:27.266]  They start striking Iran with a full bombardment.
[00:51:28.646 --> 00:51:31.867]  Then Iran will activate its sleeper cells and we go to World War III.
[00:51:33.416 --> 00:51:35.018]  And Russia instantly gets sucked in.
[00:51:35.879 --> 00:51:36.840]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:41.365]  Now, I've got a bunch of big guests, a bunch of other huge news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:51:41.485 --> 00:51:45.811]  It is all coming up in the second, third, and fourth hour.
[00:51:45.871 --> 00:51:51.017]  I'm hosting the show right through today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:52.325 --> 00:51:54.808]  And you definitely want to stay with us.
[00:51:54.848 --> 00:51:57.970]  That's why they want us off the air, because we've got their number.
[00:51:58.531 --> 00:52:02.695]  I told you Kennedy was going to have a big press conference on Friday and step down.
[00:52:03.055 --> 00:52:04.897]  Now it's being announced everywhere and endorsed Trump.
[00:52:05.337 --> 00:52:06.779]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[00:52:07.419 --> 00:52:10.502]  Please follow me on X at RealAlexJones and share all the links.
[00:52:10.522 --> 00:52:11.023]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:21.994 --> 00:52:30.040]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[00:52:31.021 --> 00:52:34.804]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:52:35.244 --> 00:52:37.446]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:52:38.267 --> 00:52:43.691]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:53.314]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:52:53.654 --> 00:52:55.515]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:52:56.136 --> 00:53:00.638]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:53:01.358 --> 00:53:07.021]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.923]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:10.743 --> 00:53:12.264]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:29.493]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:36.540]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:53:37.543 --> 00:53:38.004]  I don't know.
[00:53:49.514 --> 00:53:57.618]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:53:57.698 --> 00:54:04.342]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:04.502 --> 00:54:06.983]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:09.064]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:09.264 --> 00:54:19.032]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:19.672 --> 00:54:22.074]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:23.195]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:24.856 --> 00:54:31.583]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:31.683 --> 00:54:37.349]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:54:37.449 --> 00:54:45.997]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:54:46.037 --> 00:54:48.099]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:54:49.730 --> 00:55:03.022]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:03.502 --> 00:55:07.906]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:07.966 --> 00:55:12.610]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.352]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[00:55:16.492 --> 00:55:20.614]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it, it's amazing, it's super high quality.
[00:55:20.674 --> 00:55:22.535]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:55:22.655 --> 00:55:42.166]  Nitric Boost, good night's sleep, Joint Relief Max is amazing, Nerve Renew, Prostate Support, Probiotic Formula, CBD Full Spectrum, 25 milligram gummies, CBD Full Spectrum, 10 milligram gummies works great, Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system, Superfood Greens,
[00:55:42.386 --> 00:55:42.806]  Thank you.
[00:56:26.909 --> 00:56:31.091]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:56:31.952 --> 00:56:33.913]  America, we are lucky today.
[00:56:33.993 --> 00:56:36.934]  We're lucky in a way perhaps difficult for us all to see.
[00:56:37.154 --> 00:56:39.656]  We're lucky because we're not in a civil war right now.
[00:56:39.836 --> 00:56:45.479]  There are no makeshift field hospitals in Virginia filled with wounded boys who haven't even shaved yet.
[00:56:50.532 --> 00:57:01.375]  Toward the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln visited a 200-acre field hospital in Virginia, personally attending to thousands of wounded men who had seen a hard fighting.
[00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:08.017]  Some of the patients were missing limbs, some were blind, some were scrawny with disease, and many of them were dying.
[00:57:08.237 --> 00:57:12.518]  And some were so young that Lincoln openly shook with sobs.
[00:57:13.118 --> 00:57:18.184]  One of these soldiers recalled that President Lincoln, quote, had a kind word for all of us.
[00:57:18.464 --> 00:57:21.748]  His voice, said an onlooker, was subdued.
[00:57:21.988 --> 00:57:24.251]  His eyes were mild, but all-observing.
[00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:28.596]  The close grasp of his hand attested the sympathetic
[00:57:29.116 --> 00:57:30.376]  Great to see you.
[00:57:50.402 --> 00:57:58.007]  In one tent, Lincoln encountered a confederate member of the opposing army, and here's what the confederate wrote about that encounter.
[00:57:58.267 --> 00:58:01.589]  Quote, he halted beside my bed, and he held out his hand.
[00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:08.313]  Looking at him in the face as he stood with extended hand, Mr. President, I said, do you know to whom you offer your hand?
[00:58:08.633 --> 00:58:09.894]  I do not, he replied.
[00:58:10.134 --> 00:58:15.838]  Well, I said, you offer it to a confederate colonel who has fought you as hard as he could for four years.
[00:58:16.238 --> 00:58:20.361]  Well, says he, I hope a Confederate colonel will not refuse me his hand.
[00:58:20.821 --> 00:58:21.902]  No, sir, I replied.
[00:58:22.062 --> 00:58:22.622]  I will not.
[00:58:22.782 --> 00:58:24.884]  And I clasped his hand in both of mine.
[00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:27.525]  America, we are lucky today.
[00:58:27.606 --> 00:58:30.567]  We're lucky in a way perhaps difficult for us all to see.
[00:58:30.748 --> 00:58:33.269]  We're lucky because we're not in a civil war right now.
[00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:38.353]  We are, as I have said, in what may be called a cold civil war.
[00:58:38.753 --> 00:58:40.294]  And we need to stop our fighting.
[00:58:40.694 --> 00:58:44.817]  We need to stop the relentless bickering, the judging, the hating,
[00:58:45.377 --> 00:58:49.758]  And extend to each other a new handshake of reconciliation.
[00:58:50.118 --> 00:58:57.860]  If that assassin's bullet on July 13th in Pennsylvania had found its mark, the cold Civil War that we're now immersed in could have gone hot.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:03.201]  Not only President Trump, but maybe even our entire Republic had close brush with death.
[00:59:03.741 --> 00:59:07.362]  And a brush with death reminds us of what is precious.
[00:59:07.802 --> 00:59:12.185]  It reminds us of the preciousness of our loved ones and of life itself.
[00:59:12.565 --> 00:59:16.208]  And in this case, it recalls us to what is precious about our country.
[00:59:16.488 --> 00:59:18.790]  What is this experiment that we call America?
[00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:32.619]  For all of its dark chapters, the genocide of Native Americans, Jim Crow, slavery, imperialism abroad, and so on, America has also pursued its originating ideal of liberty and justice for all.
[00:59:32.839 --> 00:59:37.901]  That ideal is written into our nation's constitution and into our DNA.
[00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:42.062]  Our ancestors did not come to this country merely to survive.
[00:59:42.182 --> 00:59:46.204]  They came to America, the very archetype of a great nation.
[00:59:46.364 --> 00:59:49.145]  The best republics will be virtuous, John Adams said.
[00:59:49.605 --> 00:59:54.567]  And elsewhere Adams wrote that public virtue is the only foundation of republics.
[00:59:54.707 --> 01:00:04.730]  There must be a positive passion for public good established in the minds of the people, or there can be no Republican government, nor any real liberty, he wrote.
[01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:09.271]  A generation later, Ralph Waldo Emerson, our great philosopher, said, There is no way
[01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:16.273]  To enforce such virtues.
[01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:22.154]  Our founding documents, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, can inspire civic virtue.
[01:00:22.174 --> 01:00:25.315]  But in the end, it's really up to us to choose it.
[01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:30.336]  Again and again, we must realign ourselves with the founding spirit of our nation.
[01:00:30.636 --> 01:00:32.516]  Now, in particular, is such a time.
[01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:35.917]  Are we willing to extend a hand across the divide?
[01:00:36.337 --> 01:00:41.158]  Are we ready to renew ourselves as one nation, one nation indivisible?
[01:00:42.242 --> 01:00:43.203]  I believe that we are.
[01:00:43.363 --> 01:00:47.806]  I believe that process, the process of reunion of our nation, has already begun.
[01:00:48.107 --> 01:00:50.228]  That's what my presidential campaign is about.
[01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:59.595]  The goals of ending wars, reversing chronic disease, epidemics, restoring the middle class, getting corruption out of Washington, and so forth, are important.
[01:01:00.136 --> 01:01:01.897]  A powerful message from R.O.K.
[01:01:01.917 --> 01:01:05.480]  Jr., who's set to endorse Trump this Friday, as I told you.
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:08.602]  We'll be right back with huge news in 60 seconds.
[01:01:09.243 --> 01:01:11.405]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:01:12.665 --> 01:01:20.947]  On this Thursday, August 22nd, 2024 transmission, only 74 days from the most important election in world history.
[01:01:20.967 --> 01:01:23.247]  All right.
[01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:25.648]  I've got so much news.
[01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:28.669]  We did a really good job, I think, last hour hitting a lot of key stuff.
[01:01:28.729 --> 01:01:32.189]  We've got even more this hour and next hour and the hour after that.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.950]  But if you just joined us, we'll be posting this on X soon.
[01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:39.731]  We're adding some more documents and clips to what you saw earlier.
[01:01:41.817 --> 01:01:43.437]  The Deep State says Iran's about to kill Trump.
[01:01:43.457 --> 01:01:45.298]  They're trying to blame the assassination attempt on them.
[01:01:46.658 --> 01:01:51.780]  I foresaw that as their main move, predicted it days before they started launching it.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.621]  Now they are really pushing it hard.
[01:01:56.381 --> 01:02:00.322]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:02:02.403 --> 01:02:05.364]  So, more on that coming up.
[01:02:05.564 --> 01:02:09.745]  We have a special guest joining us to look at what's really happening in the economy,
[01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:14.447]  And these fake job numbers and all the rest of it.
[01:02:14.467 --> 01:02:15.368]  Really smart guy.
[01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:17.530]  Alfie Oaks from Florida.
[01:02:18.251 --> 01:02:22.436]  One of the biggest farmers in the state and also owns the coolest grocery stores I've ever seen.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.401]  Farm to table.
[01:02:27.142 --> 01:02:31.407]  He's going to be joining us coming up in about three minutes, four minutes.
[01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:41.645]  And then I'm going to continue to intersperse it with all the other campaign and DNC news we've got, and boy, there's a lot of that.
[01:02:41.665 --> 01:02:47.769]  I mean, to say that they're lying and spinning is just an understatement.
[01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:59.877]  They have sheriffs on there that criticize Kamala for never going to the border, and saying it's totally dangerous, just saying she's the most incredible border czar ever, right after she said she wasn't a border czar for the last three weeks.
[01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:03.044]  And we have Senator Murray saying the same thing.
[01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:04.765]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:10.010]  And I've got more here of the garbage they were putting out.
[01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.492]  And the coach, Tim Walls, he's the coach.
[01:03:12.532 --> 01:03:14.473]  He's not the Chinese Communist agent.
[01:03:14.513 --> 01:03:15.534]  He's not the stolen valor.
[01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:17.836]  He's not tampon Tim.
[01:03:20.158 --> 01:03:20.899]  I can't wait for J.D.
[01:03:20.979 --> 01:03:27.384]  Vance to ask him why he spent millions of dollars putting tampon machines in all the boys' bathrooms in Minnesota.
[01:03:29.145 --> 01:03:29.666]  It's incredible.
[01:03:31.124 --> 01:03:36.045]  But they're not just trying to castrate your sons and sterilize your daughters through surgeries.
[01:03:36.685 --> 01:03:39.846]  That's just how they make post-birth abortion cool.
[01:03:40.046 --> 01:03:45.907]  They can't actually physically kill you or get you to euthanize yourself like they made fashionable in Europe and Canada and they're trying here.
[01:03:45.927 --> 01:03:50.808]  They want to sterilize you once you're already born, but make it cool like the Emperor's New Clothes.
[01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:53.829]  But if you go back to the end of World War II,
[01:03:55.954 --> 01:04:00.915]  And now the people that ran our country had defeated, you know, some of the other competing tyrannies.
[01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:07.276]  They wanted a way to lower fertility, dumb people down, give them higher cancer rates and more docile.
[01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:10.277]  They started adding cancer viruses to the vaccines.
[01:04:10.397 --> 01:04:12.497]  You see cancer rates explode stratospherically.
[01:04:13.798 --> 01:04:20.399]  They began to adulterate the food, a lot of poisonous additives, just like the cigarette makers did, basically the same companies.
[01:04:22.005 --> 01:04:49.620]  And they began to add the waste from aluminum production, and nuclear weapons uranium purification, and synthesis, and from phosphate mining for fertilizer, and they would then take the raw mix of that toxic waste that was incredibly expensive to store, and they would dump it into the water supply.
[01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:58.758]  By 1960, around 60% of the country had it, and today over 70% of the United States has fluoridation of water.
[01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:08.266]  Now there are so many studies on this, literally thousands I've seen, Harvard studies, most prestigious studies out there around the world, almost every other country bans it.
[01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:13.551]  The UK kind of follows the US, maybe 30-40% of their water is fluoridated, but people just won't stand for it.
[01:05:14.351 --> 01:05:17.614]  It's not calcium fluoride that you need a little bit of, but it's still toxic.
[01:05:17.934 --> 01:05:18.395]  It's natural.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.801]  It is hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:28.602]  And one of the most deadly acids there is.
[01:05:28.682 --> 01:05:31.542]  So it's highly active in the body.
[01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:32.423]  It's an adjuvant.
[01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:35.683]  It accelerates other toxins and brings them through the blood-brain barrier.
[01:05:36.403 --> 01:05:39.404]  It attacks fertility, creates all sorts of horrible cancers.
[01:05:39.444 --> 01:05:40.464]  Bone cancer is the big one.
[01:05:42.225 --> 01:05:42.445]  U.S.
[01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:43.265]  report says
[01:05:44.414 --> 01:05:48.836]  Fluoride is linked to lower IQs in children, AP, today.
[01:05:48.876 --> 01:05:51.457]  And they spin it and they go, well, that's at double the recommended level.
[01:05:51.997 --> 01:06:03.362]  Well, most water supplies put 1.8 to 1.6, which is double what they originally called for at .8 parts per million.
[01:06:05.323 --> 01:06:10.925]  And of course, it concentrates in the bones and in other organs, like the liver and the brain.
[01:06:12.952 --> 01:06:14.373]  So they've been denying this forever.
[01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.495]  It's a known fact of science.
[01:06:17.356 --> 01:06:20.178]  You can type into Google still, even though they're in control.
[01:06:20.198 --> 01:06:21.179]  They haven't blocked this yet.
[01:06:21.219 --> 01:06:22.240]  Since I talked about it, they probably will.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:28.265]  And you can type in old-fashioned fluoride pesticide containers.
[01:06:29.093 --> 01:06:29.373]  I don't know.
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:52.001]  And since then, my dad's cleaned it up and had bulldozers cover up the few dumps, but I loved them as shooting ranges when I was a kid.
[01:06:52.021 --> 01:07:15.307]  I mean, you'd go there and there'd be like 15 washers and dryers and old bathtubs and old TVs and just Lodnum bottles that were, you know, 100 years old and just, I mean, I should have saved all that old Dr. Pepper bottles that said, you know, 10, 10, 4 and 9 or whatever, whatever, you know, like when you're supposed to drink it, had cocaine in it, you know, just piles of all these old bottles that I would just shoot.
[01:07:16.537 --> 01:07:32.431]  And the reason I raise that is there'd be old cans of poison where it wasn't just printed on them, that had since worn off, it was embedded on it, skulls and crossbones, and it would say fluoride.
[01:07:35.896 --> 01:07:37.437]  And you would dust.
[01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.398]  So type in fluoride pesticide containers.
[01:07:40.498 --> 01:07:41.258]  Just go to Google.
[01:07:42.119 --> 01:07:44.020]  Fluoride pesticide cans.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.281]  And it'll show you the old cans with the skull and crossbones.
[01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:49.462]  And it'll say fluoride and how many parts.
[01:07:50.503 --> 01:07:52.303]  And it would tell you to wear a mask when you use it.
[01:07:52.343 --> 01:07:53.664]  Now they got rid of this by the 50s.
[01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:58.846]  So again, they were using it where you would just take it and dust it on the ground.
[01:08:00.587 --> 01:08:01.848]  Just take it and dust it on the ground.
[01:08:02.368 --> 01:08:04.469]  And then roaches or whatever would walk through it.
[01:08:05.475 --> 01:08:05.875]  I don't know.
[01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:24.872]  On poultry.
[01:08:25.573 --> 01:08:27.534]  So you would dust your chickens with this.
[01:08:28.214 --> 01:08:29.015]  Active ingredients.
[01:08:29.175 --> 01:08:30.996]  Sodium fluoride.
[01:08:31.016 --> 01:08:34.618]  Not less than... I told you, save for memory, the percentage it's going across.
[01:08:34.839 --> 01:08:40.262]  And I saw cans just like that, where the paint had worn off, but was actually embedded on the can.
[01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.743]  Or maybe the paint cooked into it.
[01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:42.183]  I'm not sure.
[01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:48.887]  But I've seen that can and others that were kind of like, not pyramids, but you know, bigger on the bottom that went up.
[01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:53.210]  So, that's sodium fluoride.
[01:08:55.077 --> 01:08:59.199]  But they put electrified acid base of it that's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:03.362]  What you do need a little bit of as a trace element is calcium fluoride.
[01:09:05.263 --> 01:09:11.987]  So what they put makes your teeth weaker, makes your bones weaker, settles out throughout your body, goes through the blood-brain barrier.
[01:09:13.347 --> 01:09:17.630]  And notice on the container, good job finding it, crew, are skull and crossbones.
[01:09:24.733 --> 01:09:32.347]  So, they then start putting it in the water, and IQs go down, fertility goes down, cancer goes up.
[01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.352]  So AP reports, New York AP,
[01:09:36.383 --> 01:09:37.804]  Yesterday, the U.S.
[01:09:37.824 --> 01:09:46.027]  government report, expected to stir debate, concluded that fluoride in drinking water at twice the recommended limit is linked to lower IQs in children.
[01:09:46.067 --> 01:09:48.328]  It's also cancer, everything else that is mentioned.
[01:09:48.608 --> 01:09:50.549]  And they said with moderate confidence they know this.
[01:09:51.389 --> 01:09:52.370]  So they're getting out ahead of it.
[01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:54.131]  Because they're talking about all the chemicals in the water.
[01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:56.412]  They put the poison in the water.
[01:09:57.612 --> 01:09:59.313]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:10:00.882 --> 01:10:01.343]  We're good to go.
[01:10:17.202 --> 01:10:24.864]  Marks the first time the federal agency has determined with moderate confidence that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in kids.
[01:10:25.245 --> 01:10:34.527]  While the report was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoride in drinking water alone, it is a striking acknowledgment of a potential neurological risk from high levels of fluoride.
[01:10:34.928 --> 01:10:42.650]  We've read these similar reports from Harvard, you name it, in front of the Austin City Council, and they laugh at us and turn their microphones off and walk away.
[01:10:51.533 --> 01:10:51.993]  I'll just ask.
[01:10:58.095 --> 01:11:06.557]  Now, if this doesn't upset you, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[01:11:08.057 --> 01:11:13.378]  It is cockroach poison when it's just sodium fluoride.
[01:11:15.559 --> 01:11:16.919]  Cockroach poison.
[01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:28.086]  They take it and they turn it into an acid form where it's incredibly active in the body as an adjuvant to accelerate all of their toxins and bind to them and carry them through the blood-brain barrier.
[01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:30.826]  And also into your bone marrow.
[01:11:32.647 --> 01:11:32.987]  AP.
[01:11:34.507 --> 01:11:34.767]  U.S.
[01:11:34.787 --> 01:11:35.428]  government report.
[01:11:36.368 --> 01:11:37.688]  Fluoride lowers IQs.
[01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.489]  Alright.
[01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:43.510]  I've covered that.
[01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:44.850]  That's who runs your government.
[01:11:46.371 --> 01:11:47.391]  That's what they're doing to you.
[01:11:49.369 --> 01:11:50.970]  And they think it's funny.
[01:11:52.071 --> 01:12:02.859]  But another thing we've told you over and over again, but now that it's in AP, now that it's in a major CDC, FDA report, sue your cities!
[01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:03.879]  You have standing!
[01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:08.343]  You have been victimized by this, and get them to get it the hell out of the damn water!
[01:12:08.543 --> 01:12:14.307]  You go to HEB, and they got still big containers of water.
[01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:15.612]  I think?
[01:12:34.864 --> 01:12:39.806]  Early onset of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's disease.
[01:12:40.246 --> 01:12:42.366]  They're murdering us!
[01:12:43.347 --> 01:12:44.647]  I know that's scary to admit it.
[01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:46.468]  It was known science then.
[01:12:47.288 --> 01:12:51.329]  Iodine is in the halogen family the same as fluoride, but it is the only good halogen.
[01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:54.630]  Not the bromide, the bromine, the fluoride, the chlorine.
[01:12:55.371 --> 01:13:02.393]  They bomb you with the bad fluoride, the bad halogen, and then keep you away from the iodine.
[01:13:03.308 --> 01:13:05.349]  It also studies show can remove some of this out of your body.
[01:13:05.869 --> 01:13:12.913]  That's why you want X2 and X3 that literally supercharges your whole body, not just countering the fluoride at infowarestore.com.
[01:13:14.273 --> 01:13:16.214]  Or get Himalayan salt.
[01:13:16.874 --> 01:13:19.296]  It's got to have purple and pink flecks inside of it.
[01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:22.037]  And that means it's got close to atomic iodine.
[01:13:22.077 --> 01:13:23.698]  It's still partially bound to the sodium.
[01:13:23.998 --> 01:13:26.299]  But if you don't get X2 or X3, get that.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.301]  Whatever you do, do it!
[01:13:31.477 --> 01:13:34.542]  All right, joining us for the rest of the hour is a good friend of mine, Alfie Oaks.
[01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:39.169]  And you can follow him at alfieforamerica.com.
[01:13:39.569 --> 01:13:45.017]  He has the most fabulous grocery stores I've ever seen on the west coast there in Naples and other areas of Florida.
[01:13:45.037 --> 01:13:46.680]  He's also one of the biggest farmers in Florida.
[01:13:47.679 --> 01:14:01.147]  And he wants to come on, and I'm glad he's here, to talk about what's really happening in the economy, what's really happening with the jobless numbers, what's really- he fought back and wouldn't wear the mask, and wouldn't close his grocery store, and wouldn't make his employees take the poison shots.
[01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:05.928]  So I want to get his take on what's happening in the world and make other observations.
[01:14:05.968 --> 01:14:18.233]  He's got, what does he make of the Commerce Secretary saying she doesn't know what the Department of Labor and Statistics is, that's the biggest part of the Department of Commerce, and that it's made up that they've lied about the jobs numbers, 818,000, when that's their own department saying it.
[01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:20.453]  Trump says that.
[01:14:20.493 --> 01:14:22.074]  That part, I don't know what that department is.
[01:14:23.479 --> 01:14:25.160]  Like Sergeant Schultz in Hogan's Heroes.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.560]  I know nothing!
[01:14:27.181 --> 01:14:27.581]  Nothing!
[01:14:28.101 --> 01:14:33.524]  Well, we got somebody that actually employs a ton of people, and he's here to talk about the real economy and where this is going in this election.
[01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.225]  Alfie, great to see your face.
[01:14:36.065 --> 01:14:37.826]  I've got a lot of questions, but where do you want to start, brother?
[01:14:38.717 --> 01:14:49.924]  Well, you know, you were you were talking about the fluoride and we've made, you know, this is where the local, you know, local politics is so important for every community.
[01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:50.384]  We got it.
[01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:53.106]  I got heavily involved in local politics and especially in 2020, 2022.
[01:14:54.907 --> 01:15:01.850]  And with a favorable board, we were able to get the fluoride taken out of the water completely in Collier County.
[01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:06.111]  And, you know, I'm right lockstep with you.
[01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:09.333]  We were in front of the board explaining this to them.
[01:15:09.393 --> 01:15:10.733]  Many people have been duped by it.
[01:15:11.313 --> 01:15:16.596]  They send a guy around everywhere in the country whenever there's a resistance, and the guy puts on this spiel.
[01:15:16.616 --> 01:15:22.638]  He comes in a white coat as a doctor and tells everybody how safe it is and how great it is for your teeth.
[01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:24.859]  And this time, you know, I said, you know what?
[01:15:25.179 --> 01:15:30.400]  You know what's different this time than when you came back here like seven years ago when I tried to get it out of the water?
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.000]  Is we don't trust you guys anymore.
[01:15:32.301 --> 01:15:34.041]  The general public doesn't trust you.
[01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:35.281]  We're not buying into your lies.
[01:15:35.621 --> 01:15:41.003]  And we know there's a big difference between the fluorosilic acid poison, like what you said, right?
[01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:44.624]  Poison, it's a toxic material that should never, ever go into anyone's body.
[01:15:45.064 --> 01:15:47.125]  And that's different than sodium fluoride.
[01:15:47.145 --> 01:15:50.325]  And not that sodium fluoride is good for you, but it's not nearly as toxic.
[01:15:50.365 --> 01:15:51.786]  And that's not what they're putting in the water.
[01:15:52.546 --> 01:15:55.268]  They're putting poison in the water and it is to destroy us.
[01:15:55.288 --> 01:15:57.890]  They're putting fluoride worse than the rat poison in there.
[01:15:58.991 --> 01:16:00.032]  Yes, it is.
[01:16:00.552 --> 01:16:09.859]  And it actually, it's, I believe that it's an effort to control our spirituality because there, you know, you have the pineal gland gets calcified.
[01:16:09.879 --> 01:16:10.820]  That's not your opinion.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.323]  It does get calcified and it absolutely, sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:14.363 --> 01:16:15.263]  It lowers brainwaves.
[01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:15.484]  Go ahead.
[01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:29.399]  Yeah, no, it reduces our spirituality, our connection to spirituality, which is what they don't want us to have, because they want us to think that they are our God, our Lord, and they don't want you to be connected to your spirituality.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.021]  And there's so much other going on.
[01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:44.209]  My fight here recently has been more with food than anything, and I want to talk about the elections that happened in Florida was so disgusting here for our primary, but food primarily.
[01:16:44.329 --> 01:16:51.473]  We are poisoning all of us Americans here at numbers that are just astounding.
[01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:54.255]  I mean, when you start looking at the autism rate is like one in 32.
[01:16:54.295 --> 01:16:55.055]  It used to be, even in
[01:16:58.717 --> 01:17:06.041]  In the year 2000, it was one in a thousand, and you go back into the 20s and, you know, 1920, it was like one in a hundred thousand.
[01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:17.408]  This is insane, and this is because of vaccines, this is because of fluoride, this is because of all the genetically modified grains that the government is subsidizing for these farmers across the country to grow.
[01:17:17.588 --> 01:17:18.908]  They can't even buy any other seed.
[01:17:18.928 --> 01:17:20.089]  I have to go out of the country.
[01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:20.730]  I farm 6,000 acres.
[01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:31.521]  I have to go out of the country to buy non-GMO vegetable seeds to sell because it's almost impossible to get any volume of seed here.
[01:17:31.562 --> 01:17:40.252]  And that's a whole other thing where Bill Gates and a few other companies have bought up almost all the domestic and international seed companies and they're forcing Terminator seeds that don't even produce new seeds.
[01:17:41.753 --> 01:17:42.254]  Absolutely.
[01:17:42.294 --> 01:17:45.458]  They've basically taken over the whole system.
[01:17:45.518 --> 01:17:55.329]  And the sad thing is, in other countries, even Russia, Vladimir Putin will not let these GMOs in there because he saw the devastating effects.
[01:17:55.349 --> 01:17:59.454]  They did have it there for a while and he watched the devastating effects and then he made it a felony to bring it in.
[01:17:59.734 --> 01:18:01.396]  And so many people go to Europe
[01:18:01.696 --> 01:18:02.056]  I don't know.
[01:18:27.108 --> 01:18:27.589]  Well, that's right.
[01:18:27.609 --> 01:18:31.154]  Tucker Carlson had a great guest who made films and books about it.
[01:18:31.194 --> 01:18:31.575]  It's true.
[01:18:32.016 --> 01:18:35.421]  The cigarette makers are actually owned by Big Food.
[01:18:35.441 --> 01:18:37.284]  It's how the cigarette makers went into Big Food.
[01:18:37.324 --> 01:18:41.630]  And so just like they put all those weird chemicals to addict you in cigarettes and tobacco, they do the same thing with food.
[01:18:42.586 --> 01:18:43.006]  Absolutely.
[01:18:43.647 --> 01:18:50.551]  I mean, high fructose corn syrup is one of the very most addictive compounds that the human body, it's more addicting than cocaine.
[01:18:50.911 --> 01:18:54.314]  And they start pumping this into the children at a young age.
[01:18:54.374 --> 01:18:58.056]  I mean, you know, the scam starts the second a child is born.
[01:18:58.096 --> 01:19:02.279]  They want to jab it with a vaccine when the baby doesn't even have an immune system.
[01:19:02.599 --> 01:19:07.222]  And then they try to tell mothers for a long time, and thank God that's changing a little bit, that breast
[01:19:07.762 --> 01:19:31.789]  Eating is not important to go ahead and give them this formula that's loaded with, I mean, the formula is poison that the government pays for, you know, for people that, and this is an attack on the people that don't have money because they get the WIC program or whatever that's going to buy this formula that has the high fructose corn syrup and all this garbage in it and gets the child, it's like addicting your
[01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:35.012]  Infant baby to cocaine as soon as it comes out of the womb.
[01:19:35.052 --> 01:19:38.976]  And we know that their brain mass is massively reduced when you're not breastfed.
[01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:40.017]  And that's why we have breasts.
[01:19:40.038 --> 01:19:41.079]  It's why mammals have breasts.
[01:19:41.479 --> 01:19:42.180]  Whales have them.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:43.421]  Horses have them.
[01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:44.082]  Cows have them.
[01:19:44.202 --> 01:19:45.103]  All mammals have them.
[01:19:45.463 --> 01:19:47.486]  And females have it for a reason.
[01:19:47.546 --> 01:19:49.328]  That's what you're supposed to eat when you're a baby.
[01:19:50.618 --> 01:19:51.198]  Absolutely.
[01:19:53.899 --> 01:20:00.802]  I now have 220 cows, jerseys, that we do the raw milk with.
[01:20:01.102 --> 01:20:03.323]  If you're not going to drink raw milk, then just don't drink milk.
[01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:07.945]  You're better off to drink an oat milk or something like that if you can get a really clean one or make it yourself.
[01:20:09.445 --> 01:20:13.726]  Out of our almonds or, you know, take nuts and make your own milk.
[01:20:14.046 --> 01:20:17.046]  We made some walnut milk the other day that was really good.
[01:20:17.086 --> 01:20:19.067]  But we have raw milk and raw milk is amazing for you.
[01:20:19.867 --> 01:20:20.627]  You'll lose weight.
[01:20:20.847 --> 01:20:21.307]  You can drink.
[01:20:21.767 --> 01:20:23.988]  Our raw milk has 35, 40 percent milk fat.
[01:20:24.788 --> 01:20:28.769]  I got one family drinks nine gallons of it a week and they're all skinny as rails and fit.
[01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:32.449]  And, you know, we got to get back to small farms.
[01:20:32.749 --> 01:20:36.450]  We got to get back to educating people about what's right.
[01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:49.339]  You know as well as I do that the food pyramid that the USDA came out with was the biggest scandal ever, all influenced by this big food, and if you turn that pyramid upside down, you actually have a much healthier diet.
[01:20:49.499 --> 01:20:55.444]  And let me just back you up, and we'll go to break in a few minutes, we'll have the floor when we come back, but since you mention it...
[01:20:56.164 --> 01:21:22.038]  They don't just give them this quote, formula, they come up with the 50s, that has nothing to do with what the human brain needs, and they had so many scandals of kids dying around the world, and here with the first formulas, and they're all horrible, they're all meant to literally dumb us down, it's all scientifically done, but all over the country and the world, they have fluoride water for babies, and these mothers get this and mix the formula with it, so you're getting a chemical they admit gives you cancer, destroys your fertility, and lowers your IQ.
[01:21:22.098 --> 01:21:23.179]  Let's put that back on screen.
[01:21:23.359 --> 01:21:23.699]  There it is.
[01:21:25.421 --> 01:21:26.682]  I mean, this is just crazy, Alfie.
[01:21:27.223 --> 01:21:28.043]  You guys just had it up.
[01:21:28.063 --> 01:21:28.504]  Put it back up.
[01:21:28.524 --> 01:21:28.824]  There it is.
[01:21:29.645 --> 01:21:31.106]  It's really sad and it's intentional.
[01:21:31.406 --> 01:21:33.948]  I mean, so what they do, they want to get you sick.
[01:21:33.968 --> 01:21:35.289]  They want to keep us sick forever.
[01:21:35.509 --> 01:21:36.610]  They try to get children.
[01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:44.337]  You know, the amount of children, over 55% of the children that are of 15 years of age are now on some kind of medication.
[01:21:44.617 --> 01:21:44.937]  I don't know.
[01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:14.899]  You can be in your 80s and 90s and you can still be out there and be Kite Surfin' and bike riding.
[01:22:14.939 --> 01:22:16.742]  I've seen you, you're in great shape for your age.
[01:22:17.222 --> 01:22:19.726]  So, and again, isn't Ozempic like some kind of lizard poison?
[01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:27.038]  You know, it's a peptide, but it's got all these other, you know, pharmaceutical chemicals in it, and God knows what's in it.
[01:22:27.118 --> 01:22:31.962]  I mean, most of the stuff, they won't tell you what's in it, but it's not healthy.
[01:22:32.222 --> 01:22:34.203]  You know, you're not gonna cheat the system.
[01:22:34.223 --> 01:22:35.324]  You gotta put God's food.
[01:22:35.344 --> 01:22:35.885]  I always say it.
[01:22:36.225 --> 01:22:37.366]  Everyone says, how do you eat clean?
[01:22:37.546 --> 01:22:39.207]  Well, you gotta stay away from man's food.
[01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:40.308]  Start looking at the labels.
[01:22:40.328 --> 01:22:41.669]  Go in the grocery store, look at the labels.
[01:22:41.889 --> 01:22:45.492]  If you can't pronounce it, or you don't know what it is, then don't put it in your body.
[01:22:45.572 --> 01:22:47.774]  And almost everything in there is that garbage.
[01:22:49.417 --> 01:22:50.578]  I want to put this back on screen.
[01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:51.338]  This is the AP.
[01:22:51.459 --> 01:22:51.699]  U.S.
[01:22:51.739 --> 01:22:54.120]  Reports says Florida is linked to lower IQ in kids.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.122]  Why do you think they're finally admitting what was known?
[01:22:56.462 --> 01:22:58.964]  Remember, they called people crazy back in the 40s and said don't do this.
[01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:02.446]  When it was mainline science, people knew it was roach poison, rat poison.
[01:23:02.547 --> 01:23:04.388]  Why would they try something like this?
[01:23:04.848 --> 01:23:05.789]  Stay there, we've got to go to break.
[01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:09.071]  Why would they ever want to dumb us down, right?
[01:23:09.171 --> 01:23:09.532]  That's right.
[01:23:09.612 --> 01:23:11.273]  Alfie Yokes, what's the best website for people to visit?
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:23.266]  Alpi4America.com, we have Alpi4America on X. I'm not really doing huge social media, we gotta get, you know, pushing into that more, but we're doing a lot.
[01:23:23.326 --> 01:23:24.887]  Alright, stay right there, we'll come right back to you.
[01:23:30.433 --> 01:23:33.314]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:23:34.255 --> 01:23:39.256]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:23:39.757 --> 01:23:46.899]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.440]  They let us private label their products.
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.341]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:23:52.563 --> 01:23:55.326]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:23:55.566 --> 01:23:56.887]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:23:57.228 --> 01:24:00.151]  And so it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:24:00.932 --> 01:24:01.532]  That's the name.
[01:24:01.793 --> 01:24:07.479]  So we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[01:24:07.939 --> 01:24:08.280]  Tumeric.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.541]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[01:24:10.002 --> 01:24:11.603]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[01:24:11.643 --> 01:24:13.666]  They even let us use their name.
[01:24:13.946 --> 01:24:14.947]  It's now our best seller.
[01:24:15.147 --> 01:24:16.148]  We sold out of our version.
[01:24:16.429 --> 01:24:17.870]  Their version has a white model.
[01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:19.612]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:24:20.133 --> 01:24:21.715]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:21.975 --> 01:24:24.418]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:25.421 --> 01:24:28.402]  Well, he runs a massive farming operation in Florida.
[01:24:29.223 --> 01:24:33.905]  He's got undoubtedly the best, cleanest organic stores in the world.
[01:24:33.965 --> 01:24:34.525]  A model for everybody.
[01:24:34.545 --> 01:24:37.246]  He's like a lifeboat or a Noah's Ark.
[01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:41.408]  He's Alveo's great guide and so much great work in Florida and around the country.
[01:24:41.968 --> 01:24:43.949]  And we always really enjoy talking to him.
[01:24:44.549 --> 01:24:49.591]  And so recap and get back into what you were saying about this poisoning and where it's going.
[01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:51.272]  And they send the guy in the lab coat.
[01:24:52.012 --> 01:25:01.598]  Or in the white coat, like the magician, and say, no, fluoride's good for you in the water, when it's bug poison and rat poison, and now even the FDA, and now the CDC's admitting it.
[01:25:01.878 --> 01:25:05.741]  I was asked the question, why do you think they're suddenly coming out and admitting it's all true?
[01:25:07.063 --> 01:25:10.506]  I think because of, you know, they used to own the narrative, right?
[01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:15.130]  And now we have all these other information channels to get it, and the truth just comes out.
[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.953]  And this is what, this is really the only way to fix anything.
[01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:28.883]  It's the same way that we're going to, if we're ever going to fix our food crisis, our food system in this country, it's got to be by people becoming aware and saying, okay, we're going to stop
[01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:30.503]  I'm against the farm subsidies.
[01:25:30.523 --> 01:25:35.045]  I'm a huge farmer and I don't even like big farms, but we grow things the right way and we don't take any farm subsidies.
[01:25:51.471 --> 01:25:56.155]  The farm subsidies are what's ruining, it's starting, it's the beginning of the ruination of it.
[01:25:56.195 --> 01:25:58.717]  They're getting subsidized because the farmers couldn't make money.
[01:25:58.757 --> 01:26:04.703]  They couldn't afford to pay Monsanto and Bayer and all these companies where they buy all their garbage product from.
[01:26:05.223 --> 01:26:08.065]  But the government comes in and steps in and gives them this money.
[01:26:08.085 --> 01:26:14.091]  And to give you an idea, like a farmer that maybe makes three or four hundred thousand dollars a year, he might sell
[01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:18.752]  You know, eight or ten million dollars worth of wheat or corn or soy at the end of the day.
[01:26:18.792 --> 01:26:20.152]  They don't use much labor in that.
[01:26:20.933 --> 01:26:26.154]  And so the money that they spend is all on the seed and the fertilizer and the spray materials.
[01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:31.435]  And then they get subsidized maybe a couple million dollars to stay afloat from the government.
[01:26:31.535 --> 01:26:33.356]  And they're making less than that.
[01:26:33.616 --> 01:26:37.557]  But the majority of all the money that they take in, it all goes to these
[01:26:38.979 --> 01:26:42.722]  Companies, the seed companies, the fertilizer, I mean... And now, let me ask you about this.
[01:26:42.802 --> 01:26:46.145]  Bill Gates and the EU, they want to come in and outlaw organic farming.
[01:26:46.345 --> 01:26:48.627]  Guardian headlines, organic farming's the worst.
[01:26:49.227 --> 01:26:54.471]  They're paying farmers all over Europe and now here not to grow organic crops and to grow the poison crops.
[01:26:54.491 --> 01:26:55.232]  This is a takeover.
[01:26:56.013 --> 01:26:57.834]  It is a takeover.
[01:26:59.295 --> 01:27:03.897]  I pray it never comes to it, but I'll be the guy going down in a blaze of glory.
[01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:06.498]  We've got plenty of guns, plenty of ammo.
[01:27:06.518 --> 01:27:07.938]  We're going to defend our farm.
[01:27:07.978 --> 01:27:10.720]  We've got 3,000 employees.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.041]  We have enough guns to put in the hand of every employee if we need to be.
[01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:16.242]  And I pray that it never comes to that.
[01:27:17.323 --> 01:27:21.164]  We know what has happened in the past with these takeovers.
[01:27:21.264 --> 01:27:23.405]  Usually they go and try to kill the farmers.
[01:27:23.425 --> 01:27:24.326]  In Russia, they did.
[01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:25.306]  I don't
[01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:49.190]  I should have introduced you as probably more than anybody in the food wars.
[01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:54.052]  I mean, you're like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of this fight and your dad's famous for it.
[01:27:54.072 --> 01:27:55.153]  I mean, you were born into this.
[01:28:09.642 --> 01:28:18.227]  Yeah, so Clay Higgins, Congressman Clay Higgins, one of my favorite congressmen, he calls me one night, Sunday night, he says, he says, man, brother, I need to ask you for a favor.
[01:28:18.247 --> 01:28:23.169]  He says, I need you to be in Baton Rouge, Louisiana tomorrow morning at 730 in the morning.
[01:28:23.249 --> 01:28:24.470]  I'm like, Clay, it's like,
[01:28:25.290 --> 01:28:26.752]  830 Sunday, 9 o'clock Sunday night.
[01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:29.093]  I'm saying you're talking about, you know, 10 hours from now.
[01:28:29.454 --> 01:28:30.234]  He said, I need you, brother.
[01:28:30.254 --> 01:28:32.296]  He said, I thought we were going to be able to get this passed.
[01:28:32.616 --> 01:28:36.479]  They were having whether they'd make raw milk legal in Louisiana.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.342]  And he said, I thought we could win it, but if you come up there, we'll win it.
[01:28:39.382 --> 01:28:50.311]  So I flew up there and I sat in front of their Senate and Congress there for a talk for 30 or 40 minutes and really disbarred all the misinformation about raw milk.
[01:28:50.351 --> 01:28:53.173]  And it was unanimous that they allowed the raw milk to come in.
[01:28:53.353 --> 01:28:55.634]  And that's the good part about you having that little private jet.
[01:28:57.714 --> 01:28:58.955]  It helped out for sure.
[01:28:59.755 --> 01:29:04.096]  But we need to get that information out to people because there's a lot of disinformation just like the fluoride.
[01:29:04.316 --> 01:29:05.957]  People thought that that wasn't hurting them.
[01:29:06.217 --> 01:29:08.818]  The people didn't understand how healthy raw milk is.
[01:29:08.878 --> 01:29:16.780]  I think the winning line that I had in Louisiana is that you're charging the cow or the raw milk for a crime it did not commit.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.041]  The raw milk comes out of that cow sterile.
[01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:21.962]  Yes, people got sick back in the 40s and 50s because it was
[01:29:22.302 --> 01:29:22.863]  We're good to go.
[01:29:51.783 --> 01:29:58.731]  All of our ancestors for eons drank raw milk, and then up until like the 50s, everything delivered to the house was raw milk.
[01:29:59.012 --> 01:30:03.737]  Then they started the homogenization, which allowed the big companies to give them basically rotten milk.
[01:30:03.797 --> 01:30:04.658]  I mean, explain that to people.
[01:30:05.495 --> 01:30:14.602]  Yeah, I mean, so, you know, the amount of urine and feces and all that stuff that's in this, in these cows, and then plus they're jabbed on hormones.
[01:30:14.682 --> 01:30:16.344]  Our cows are all grass-finished.
[01:30:16.364 --> 01:30:18.786]  The milk tastes so much better.
[01:30:18.806 --> 01:30:20.908]  I mean, the taste is just phenomenal.
[01:30:20.968 --> 01:30:23.189]  It doesn't taste gamey or anything.
[01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:25.011]  It tastes clean and delicious.
[01:30:25.031 --> 01:30:25.972]  We drink Amish milk.
[01:30:26.012 --> 01:30:27.893]  We get a big delivery every week to the office.
[01:30:27.953 --> 01:30:28.534]  Everybody buys it.
[01:30:29.094 --> 01:30:32.257]  We should have, Alfie Oaks should host the fourth hour sometime next week.
[01:30:33.423 --> 01:30:33.743]  Guys.
[01:30:34.683 --> 01:30:36.564]  And we've been having a lot of great guest hosts.
[01:30:36.584 --> 01:30:40.105]  We should move some, you know, occasionally other folks in to it.
[01:30:40.265 --> 01:30:45.767]  So yeah, let's get in the control room and let's get reconnected to Alvi Oaks.
[01:30:46.367 --> 01:30:51.929]  If you just joined us again, AP, the federal government, they're all reporting what I've been telling you for 30 years on air.
[01:30:53.971 --> 01:31:01.537]  The fluoride they put in the water massively lowers children's IQ, gives them dental fluorosis, bone spurs, cancer, lower fertility.
[01:31:02.417 --> 01:31:04.139]  The list goes on and on.
[01:31:04.899 --> 01:31:09.062]  Alfie, you were talking about how dirty so-called homogenized milk is.
[01:31:09.082 --> 01:31:09.583]  Please continue.
[01:31:10.546 --> 01:31:20.974]  Yeah, you know, I actually, I bought about 800 acres of land that we were gonna, I was gonna, I bought an old dairy so we would have the infrastructure of the dairy to put our healthy cows on.
[01:31:21.415 --> 01:31:33.524]  And I actually thought that possibly I would be able to take the cows that they had there and maybe put them on healthy food and get them healthy enough to where, you know, I get the milk up to be something that would be passable.
[01:31:34.004 --> 01:31:39.769]  And I tried that with a handful of them and I tried that
[01:31:40.342 --> 01:31:41.824]  You've got so much knowledge about the food wars.
[01:31:41.844 --> 01:31:47.991]  What can the people do to become informed and help stop this complete takeover that we're already deep into?
[01:32:00.387 --> 01:32:03.888]  Well, we have to get back to, like, supporting small farmers.
[01:32:03.988 --> 01:32:11.150]  We have to educate ourselves on just not eating this toxic food that is shoved in front of us.
[01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:12.250]  And I know it's hard.
[01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:13.170]  It's difficult.
[01:32:13.190 --> 01:32:16.271]  Everyone says, oh, I can't afford to eat organic.
[01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:17.611]  You can't afford not to.
[01:32:17.931 --> 01:32:22.072]  When you eat real grass-finished beef, and yes, it costs twice as much, but guess what?
[01:32:22.213 --> 01:32:23.753]  Most of the time it's four or five
[01:32:24.273 --> 01:32:32.301]  More times nutritious, and you eat these, you know, organic vegetables that are grown in good soil that have all the micronutrients in it.
[01:32:32.642 --> 01:32:37.086]  The problem that we have in this country is everyone is eating this dead food.
[01:32:37.106 --> 01:32:45.995]  Their brains are saying after they fill their bellies up with all this dead food that it's still hungry, that it still needs more, and people keep eating and eating.
[01:32:46.035 --> 01:32:47.457]  When you eat the right food, when you eat
[01:32:48.057 --> 01:32:48.518]  I don't know.
[01:33:06.377 --> 01:33:13.818]  And many people even think that a McDonald's hamburger today, it might taste similar to the McDonald's hamburger that we had when we were kids.
[01:33:14.118 --> 01:33:15.039]  It's not the same thing.
[01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:16.979]  Back then, it was 100% pure beef.
[01:33:17.299 --> 01:33:19.659]  The bread didn't have the folic acid in it.
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.800]  There wasn't pink slime in the beef, in whatever they're calling beef.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.461]  There wasn't the pink slime in it.
[01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:28.401]  There wasn't all these chemicals in there.
[01:33:28.441 --> 01:33:29.781]  There wasn't all these seed oils in it.
[01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:32.642]  They actually used to fry their french fries in beef tallow.
[01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:33.582]  I'm actually starting
[01:33:34.282 --> 01:33:34.742]  I think so.
[01:33:54.369 --> 01:33:56.450]  And explain that, because that's well-known science.
[01:33:56.490 --> 01:34:08.373]  They knew in the 80s, when they said, go to these processed or artificial fats, that they literally just clog your body, your body can't process it, and that good old-fashioned, real things like beef fat is super good for you.
[01:34:08.673 --> 01:34:10.214]  That's now undebated.
[01:34:10.714 --> 01:34:12.834]  They're having to reverse themselves on that as well.
[01:34:12.854 --> 01:34:18.376]  I mean, we're really seeing a collapse in confidence in the system, but it's all been cold-bloodedly done, hasn't it?
[01:34:18.496 --> 01:34:22.357]  Explain what happens when you even heat up a good oil like coconut oil past the point.
[01:34:24.562 --> 01:34:39.851]  Yeah, you take one of these good oils, like a coconut oil, or even organic peanut oil is very expensive, but once it gets to the point where you're frying it, when it gets to that temperature,
[01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:58.558]  It becomes a toxic chemical for our bodies, and it's not as bad as some of the seed oils that we have, especially non-organic seed oils, where the process, the toxic process by which they extract the oil from these seeds, that's what's more toxic than the seeds themselves.
[01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:08.502]  But I don't think there's anything that's done more damage to the health of our country than specifically the seed oils and all the GMO, you know,
[01:35:09.242 --> 01:35:16.205]  Grains from, you know, wheat and it's just every grain, the corn, the soy, all this stuff.
[01:35:16.225 --> 01:35:27.288]  Talk about seed oils more and then why, because I read this in reports out of people that go work in Europe who are like 50 pounds overweight, they go work for two or three months there and eat like pigs but lose 30, 40 pounds and feel great.
[01:35:27.949 --> 01:35:30.109]  Europeans come here, they suddenly get fat and sick.
[01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:31.610]  Europeans are living longer.
[01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:36.932]  What is the difference between, say, in Italy, their grain stock versus what's happening here?
[01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:44.835]  Yeah, so because they're using wheat that's similar to the wheat that our grandparents had, right?
[01:35:44.975 --> 01:35:47.897]  And they're not using these ultra-processed seed oils.
[01:35:48.157 --> 01:35:49.258]  They're using a lot of butter.
[01:35:49.638 --> 01:35:50.839]  They're using lard.
[01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:53.561]  They're using these things that are actually much better for you.
[01:35:53.601 --> 01:36:05.989]  We were lied to back in the 70s when they told you that seed oil was heart-healthy oil and that lard was bad for you, and that meat is at the bottom of the pyramid, that you're supposed to eat all these carbs and sugar and all this other garbage.
[01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:16.615]  The wheat that I have at Seed to Table, that we make all of our bread, we make 3,000 or 4,000 loaves of bread a night, it's all made of organic heirloom wheat.
[01:36:16.875 --> 01:36:21.517]  The DNA profile on that wheat is like wheat's supposed to be.
[01:36:22.018 --> 01:36:32.263]  The DNA profile on the wheat that's in 99% of this country, I call it franken-wheat, it's about 25 times bigger than your own human DNA.
[01:36:32.543 --> 01:36:33.163]  It's insane.
[01:36:34.124 --> 01:36:36.847]  It looks like wheat, but it doesn't digest like wheat.
[01:36:37.127 --> 01:36:38.409]  It's very unhealthy for you.
[01:36:38.729 --> 01:36:39.910]  And that's what's in everything.
[01:36:39.991 --> 01:36:45.597]  So that's why people, you know, our great grandparents didn't have food allergies like we have.
[01:36:45.617 --> 01:36:47.799]  They weren't gluten intolerant.
[01:36:47.859 --> 01:36:49.641]  They weren't lactose intolerant.
[01:36:49.842 --> 01:36:52.705]  Because the problem that people have with milk is not the lactose.
[01:36:52.785 --> 01:36:54.166]  It's homogenized.
[01:36:54.867 --> 01:36:55.867]  Pasteurized garbage.
[01:36:56.468 --> 01:37:01.990]  The reason that we have the, it's not, you know, that we have gluten allergies, we're allergic to this franken-wheat.
[01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:06.232]  This stuff that has a, you know, 25 times bigger than our own human DNA profile.
[01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:16.757]  And once you go over and you start eating food the way that God made it, we eat the wheat that they have over in Europe is the same kind of DNA profile that we have on the wheat that I get.
[01:37:16.777 --> 01:37:19.698]  I get our wheat actually, believe it or not, from the United States here.
[01:37:20.079 --> 01:37:22.860]  It's a place called Central Milling in Utah, and they
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.545]  They grow their wheat away from anywhere else where it can't be cross pollinated.
[01:37:27.565 --> 01:37:32.109]  They're kind of out in an area where no one else grows any wheat.
[01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:40.378]  And they grow this amazing heirloom wheat and everyone comes in that thought they had gluten issues and they eat tons of our bread and they don't get
[01:37:41.387 --> 01:37:50.971]  Yeah, let's be clear, until 30, 40 years ago, it didn't exist, and now everybody I know is getting it, because you're having literally an allergic response, and once you get it, it gets worse and worse.
[01:37:51.051 --> 01:38:04.136]  So, if people simply learn about this and start supporting farmers' markets that have the right food, Amish, Mennonites, grocery stores like yours, by our choices we can turn this all around, and the system knows that, that's why they're trying to come in and literally, I could pull this up,
[01:38:04.996 --> 01:38:06.397]  Organic farming is the worst.
[01:38:06.437 --> 01:38:07.317]  Should be outlawed.
[01:38:07.377 --> 01:38:08.117]  London Guardian.
[01:38:08.197 --> 01:38:09.298]  I mean, this is all over.
[01:38:09.598 --> 01:38:14.460]  Now the new liberal thing is to ban raw milk and ban organic food.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.321]  And the left now loves nuclear reactors.
[01:38:17.361 --> 01:38:18.341]  They love war.
[01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:22.443]  I mean, and now the left's all upset.
[01:38:22.743 --> 01:38:24.483]  Suddenly conservatives want organic.
[01:38:24.523 --> 01:38:25.344]  This is bad.
[01:38:25.364 --> 01:38:27.785]  I mean, I was just showing headlines earlier for TV viewers.
[01:38:27.805 --> 01:38:28.585]  This is wild.
[01:38:29.775 --> 01:38:31.075]  Yeah, conservative values.
[01:38:31.235 --> 01:38:39.398]  You know, my father was a hardcore conservative, and he was one of the first guys in the organic movement, and all of his customers were liberals.
[01:38:39.438 --> 01:38:42.739]  He used to end up getting in arguments with them and throwing them out of there back then.
[01:38:43.139 --> 01:38:45.660]  But, I mean, it is a conservative idea.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.721]  This is being responsible for our land, being responsible for what we put in our bodies.
[01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:53.822]  That's a very conservative idea, and the left tried to
[01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:54.562]  I think so.
[01:39:23.513 --> 01:39:41.799]  to have them used in food that are good lubricants for for like you know automotive or something like that maybe but not for food and and and what was strange is when he proposed this bill the people that fought against it were not who you would think it would be you would think it would be like these big food companies
[01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:43.079]  We're good to go.
[01:40:06.405 --> 01:40:10.887]  Well, I remember growing up, my parents, you know, my mom was supposed to be super healthy, but she would get lard and cook with it.
[01:40:11.447 --> 01:40:13.988]  You try to go to the grocery store, you can't even find lard.
[01:40:14.869 --> 01:40:15.069]  Yeah.
[01:40:15.349 --> 01:40:15.589]  Yeah.
[01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:23.393]  So we, we, um, the only thing that we've eaten fried foods for the last 15 years has been only, uh, beef tallow lard.
[01:40:23.413 --> 01:40:27.494]  Uh, we, I take all the, you know, we sell about 500 steaks a night at Seed to Table.
[01:40:27.514 --> 01:40:33.677]  So we take all the fat trimmings at the butcher shop and then we, we, uh, you just basically boil it down.
[01:40:33.737 --> 01:40:34.077]  It's simple.
[01:40:34.097 --> 01:40:34.838]  You can make lard.
[01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:40.236]  You know, people don't want to spend the time, or you can make beef tallow at your house.
[01:40:40.256 --> 01:40:42.577]  You just render down the fat.
[01:40:42.597 --> 01:40:47.160]  Yeah, you put it in the pan and cook it down and then put it in a container, a dish.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.542]  So, I remember, and I've not liked McDonald's for 30 plus years.
[01:40:51.562 --> 01:40:53.903]  I remember when I was a little kid, I remember researching it.
[01:40:54.564 --> 01:40:57.745]  McDonald's was real beef with fat dripping off of it.
[01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.106]  It wasn't the best burger, but it was okay.
[01:40:59.466 --> 01:41:02.788]  And their fries were the best because it was cooked in beef fat.
[01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:07.010]  Yeah, no, 100%.
[01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:11.997]  It wasn't the healthiest thing even to eat back then, but it's so much more toxic now than it ever was.
[01:41:12.057 --> 01:41:17.565]  And people are running their kids to the drive-thru and saying, well, I ate it as a kid and I'm not in that bad of shape.
[01:41:17.645 --> 01:41:18.926]  But guess what?
[01:41:18.967 --> 01:41:21.330]  It's not the same thing, and none of this food is the same thing.
[01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:31.018]  They've taken over our, you know, 99% of the food that people are putting in their bodies in this country by volume is stuff that I would never even consider putting in my body.
[01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:38.404]  And we got to get the education piece out there and get people to, you know, there are more places popping up with healthy food.
[01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:43.088]  You go to the Midwest, it's almost impossible to find good places.
[01:41:43.168 --> 01:41:46.011]  And I have this new concept called Food and Thought.
[01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:48.173]  Food and Thought 2 is the new store.
[01:41:48.473 --> 01:42:06.959]  I'm hoping to be able to start taking that on the road and get our good bread and our good meats and our good raw milk and all these good vegetables that are grown the right way with all the micronutrients and I'm trying to get that out to the public because... Now that's beautiful and we need some of these smart people, big pockets, to help you back going nationwide.
[01:42:06.979 --> 01:42:08.200]  We've only got like six minutes left.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.062]  And we gotta get you back again soon.
[01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:10.983]  In fact, I'm always trying to get you.
[01:42:11.003 --> 01:42:11.463]  You're too busy.
[01:42:11.484 --> 01:42:12.425]  I'm glad you called one-on-one.
[01:42:12.445 --> 01:42:13.586]  So anytime you want, just tell us.
[01:42:13.606 --> 01:42:14.487]  You can also guest us.
[01:42:14.808 --> 01:42:15.789]  Maybe an hour next week.
[01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:16.550]  Talk to Daria.
[01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:17.031]  Talk to Scott.
[01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:17.932]  Let's get you on next week.
[01:42:18.573 --> 01:42:21.477]  But, by the time we have left, they tried to assassinate Trump.
[01:42:21.757 --> 01:42:23.279]  Now they're saying Iran's gonna try to kill him.
[01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:24.040]  Obviously, it's set up.
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:26.944]  What is your view on the political landscape right now on President Trump?
[01:42:28.405 --> 01:42:38.170]  I am nervous only because I know that we have a very vulnerable system of our elections, right?
[01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:48.435]  Even what I watched happen in Florida, in our own supposedly very red state of Florida, there's just nothing but shenanigans went on on this primary.
[01:42:48.455 --> 01:42:50.496]  DeSantis didn't do us any favor.
[01:42:51.256 --> 01:42:56.519]  They had HB 7050 that they passed a few years ago that makes it where
[01:42:57.419 --> 01:42:59.821]  Every, all 67 counties have to use machines.
[01:43:00.261 --> 01:43:05.705]  All 67 counties, you don't have to, voting day doesn't have to end on voting day.
[01:43:05.965 --> 01:43:12.889]  And the most egregious in that bill was that a private citizen like myself cannot challenge the election results.
[01:43:12.929 --> 01:43:15.711]  In other words, only the government agency can challenge the government.
[01:43:16.051 --> 01:43:18.893]  And so, you know, this is in the red state of Florida.
[01:43:19.193 --> 01:43:21.515]  And when we watch what's happened here, we watched
[01:43:21.915 --> 01:43:25.098]  All of our America First candidates across the board in the state of Florida.
[01:43:25.138 --> 01:43:29.882]  I mean, we took a huge beating in the state of Florida with our America First candidates.
[01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:40.610]  And every one of those America First candidates won in huge, huge margins on voting day, which was two days ago for the primary, and the early voting.
[01:43:40.851 --> 01:43:44.133]  But on the mail-in ballots, we lost miserably.
[01:43:44.373 --> 01:43:46.215]  And I think there's a lot of shenanigans going on.
[01:43:46.355 --> 01:43:46.835]  Oh, we know.
[01:43:47.216 --> 01:43:47.876]  The 2,000 mules.
[01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:48.577]  That's how they're doing it.
[01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:56.146]  It's a longer conversation, but these NGOs that are working in concert with Homeland Security are the way that it's happening.
[01:43:56.166 --> 01:44:01.810]  The NGOs are obviously funneling these billions of dollars south of the border to create this illegal migration.
[01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:05.553]  In Florida, we've had 550,000 illegals flown in.
[01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:07.294]  DeSantis doesn't say a word about it.
[01:44:07.434 --> 01:44:09.095]  And then, believe me, I loved DeSantis early on.
[01:44:09.115 --> 01:44:11.197]  He did great things for our state.
[01:44:11.277 --> 01:44:15.200]  But when he decided to come against Trump, I think he may have sold his soul.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:16.681]  Well, that's right.
[01:44:16.701 --> 01:44:18.123]  They can charge the airlines for human smuggling.
[01:44:18.143 --> 01:44:19.965]  Just charge the company and charge the people flying the plane.
[01:44:19.985 --> 01:44:20.446]  It's over right there.
[01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:38.553]  We need to get the National Guard involved with this and make a stand.
[01:44:38.573 --> 01:44:39.994]  Somebody's got to be bold enough to do it.
[01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:42.657]  And they're going and getting their driver's license.
[01:44:43.357 --> 01:44:44.038]  And you know what?
[01:44:44.158 --> 01:44:45.019]  This is the crazy thing.
[01:44:45.059 --> 01:44:52.665]  The DMV actually does a really good job in Florida of knowing if the people that get the driver's license are legal, if they're citizens or not.
[01:44:52.946 --> 01:44:57.510]  They actually have to know that because they give that information to the clerk of courts so that
[01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:06.517]  They don't become jurors because if someone finds a juror that was not a legal citizen, then they can throw the whole thing out.
[01:45:06.837 --> 01:45:09.860]  So they have the information, but they're not allowed to share it.
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.323]  By floor law, they're not allowed to share it with the SOE.
[01:45:13.503 --> 01:45:14.364]  Like, why is that?
[01:45:14.424 --> 01:45:15.204]  That's ridiculous.
[01:45:15.605 --> 01:45:26.874]  And then if this person that has this driver's license that's not a citizen goes to our SOE and asks for a ballot, they're not allowed to ask him if they're a citizen because he has a local
[01:45:27.114 --> 01:45:28.997]  And the Democrats are telling illegals to vote.
[01:45:29.037 --> 01:45:37.671]  And now the Feds have said, the FBI three weeks ago, oh, the Russians and the Chinese are going to hack the voter roll databases in states that do check.
[01:45:37.792 --> 01:45:39.414]  So, they're really setting it up.
[01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:41.311]  They are setting up.
[01:45:41.351 --> 01:45:46.333]  I mean, this Albert Censor, I'm sure a lot of your folks watching are hopefully familiar with it.
[01:45:46.573 --> 01:45:56.799]  The Albert Censor that Homeland Security put on all of the SOEs across the country to supposedly protect us from Russia and China are the way that they get in.
[01:45:57.139 --> 01:45:58.199]  And this is the crazy thing.
[01:45:58.279 --> 01:46:02.741]  All this information that comes out of the Albert Censor goes, who do they send it to?
[01:46:02.801 --> 01:46:04.342]  They don't send it to the government.
[01:46:04.362 --> 01:46:05.842]  They send it to these NGOs.
[01:46:06.303 --> 01:46:08.163]  And then they're the ones that make the fake ballots.
[01:46:08.183 --> 01:46:12.805]  Like the 400,000 ballots that we had that were perfectly filled out in Pennsylvania that we found in 2020.
[01:46:12.965 --> 01:46:16.446]  And Laura Logan's confirmed in Afghanistan they've trained 70,000 terrorists.
[01:46:18.007 --> 01:46:28.485]  And when they gave him $85 million of equipment, it's all the government scanners and basically visa and passport printers to give these terrorists real, real entry to the U.S.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:30.261]  Same thing you're talking about.
[01:46:31.182 --> 01:46:32.684]  Same thing.
[01:46:32.704 --> 01:46:40.773]  The NGOs are being funded by the globalists who want to take this country down and they're doing a great job at it and we're just not paying attention to what the real problem is.
[01:46:40.813 --> 01:46:42.475]  And the real problem is this mail-in voting.
[01:46:42.915 --> 01:46:45.919]  This is what took us down in Florida here.
[01:46:46.259 --> 01:46:48.501]  I could not have been more disgusted with
[01:46:50.063 --> 01:46:52.945]  Florida is one of the best states so people get complacent.
[01:46:52.965 --> 01:46:54.706]  Florida and Texas are still barely hanging on, folks.
[01:46:54.726 --> 01:46:58.369]  The left says Florida's in play because they've got so many dead people and illegals ready to vote.
[01:47:18.037 --> 01:47:19.439]  Yeah, so many illegals.
[01:47:19.539 --> 01:47:28.606]  And the voting rolls are intentionally not cleaned up, because in the middle of the night, the Albert system, they come through there, they take the unregistered voters, put them in registered, and they send the fake ballots.
[01:47:28.926 --> 01:47:32.009]  And this is going on all over the country, and we have to stop it.
[01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:40.215]  The only thing that I can say is when Trump turned his head, and I know that God's on our side, we watched you being able to persevere and stay on.
[01:47:40.235 --> 01:47:42.998]  I mean, they've been throwing everything at you, brother, and I
[01:47:43.578 --> 01:47:47.480]  I applaud you for your tenacity and your will to keep fighting.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:54.523]  And, you know, we got Elon Musk that did a great job to get the truth out, and Tucker moved over there and got more truth than any.
[01:47:54.723 --> 01:47:56.204]  So there is a lot of truth getting out.
[01:47:56.224 --> 01:47:59.405]  We need to keep getting that truth out, and people need to act on that truth.
[01:47:59.465 --> 01:48:06.728]  People need to pay attention to what they're putting in their bodies and get mean and lean, and we gotta take on this corruption.
[01:48:06.788 --> 01:48:08.269]  It's a spiritual war right now.
[01:48:08.999 --> 01:48:10.479]  Alfie, talk to my producers right now.
[01:48:10.559 --> 01:48:12.260]  I want to get you to host an hour next week.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.261]  If you've got the time, you'll host a fourth hour.
[01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:17.101]  Okay, guys, set him up, find out what day.
[01:48:17.201 --> 01:48:17.941]  Let's get him in right now.
[01:48:18.302 --> 01:48:19.442]  Alfie Oaks, we salute you.
[01:48:19.742 --> 01:48:20.442]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:48:21.282 --> 01:48:21.802]  Thank you, brother.
[01:48:21.983 --> 01:48:22.483]  Keep the faith.
[01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:23.363]  Absolutely.
[01:48:23.383 --> 01:48:25.984]  Anytime he wants to host a fourth hour, let's get Alfie Oaks in there.
[01:48:26.104 --> 01:48:26.444]  All right.
[01:48:28.204 --> 01:48:33.186]  I've not scratched the surface on financial news, international news, election news, the DNC.
[01:48:33.226 --> 01:48:34.606]  I have a giant stack coming up.
[01:48:35.458 --> 01:48:42.980]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:45.861]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:48:46.481 --> 01:48:53.002]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:48:53.022 --> 01:48:56.563]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:48:57.043 --> 01:49:03.205]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:49:04.125 --> 01:49:12.790]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:22.075]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:49:22.475 --> 01:49:23.576]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:23.596 --> 01:49:24.696]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:49:25.116 --> 01:49:26.037]  It is very, very popular.
[01:49:26.617 --> 01:49:28.379]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:49:28.559 --> 01:49:35.464]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:49:35.925 --> 01:49:39.948]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:49:40.168 --> 01:49:44.231]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:49:44.772 --> 01:49:52.498]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:49:53.599 --> 01:49:54.420]  And they kicked him back.
[01:49:55.675 --> 01:49:59.277]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:49:59.577 --> 01:50:10.744]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:50:11.264 --> 01:50:19.649]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:50:20.029 --> 01:50:21.530]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.392]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:23.412 --> 01:50:25.313]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:50:25.353 --> 01:50:28.275]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:50:28.295 --> 01:50:29.076]  You'll have a historical memento.
[01:50:43.166 --> 01:50:52.288]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:52.668 --> 01:50:53.968]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:50:54.628 --> 01:50:57.529]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:50:58.089 --> 01:51:01.090]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:06.291]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:51:06.671 --> 01:51:08.771]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:51:09.572 --> 01:51:11.572]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[01:51:12.052 --> 01:51:15.535]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:51:15.555 --> 01:51:16.175]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:18.918]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:19.618]  That's not what this is.
[01:51:19.678 --> 01:51:20.799]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:51:21.399 --> 01:51:34.490]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:35.711]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:38.593]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[01:51:40.214 --> 01:51:41.135]  Something like that.
[01:51:41.155 --> 01:51:41.555]  $10 or $11.
[01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:46.778]  And so the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:51:46.818 --> 01:51:49.960]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:51:50.481 --> 01:51:58.186]  So get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:51:58.546 --> 01:51:59.647]  The decision is yours.
[01:52:00.087 --> 01:52:01.068]  This is a limited edition.
[01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:06.052]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:52:06.732 --> 01:52:17.021]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:52:17.401 --> 01:52:26.288]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:52:26.688 --> 01:52:27.549]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:27.909 --> 01:52:29.551]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:52:35.453 --> 01:52:41.436]  All right, in this hour, I want to counter the incredible disinformation the DNC and where they say the economy is.
[01:52:41.576 --> 01:52:51.821]  All this huge news coming out that they consciously lied at the Department of Commerce, the Department of Statistics and Labor, and now they're claiming that's fake news.
[01:52:51.901 --> 01:52:52.301]  So much
[01:52:53.021 --> 01:52:57.642]  More on the economy, coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:52:57.662 --> 01:53:01.003]  But I wanted to play this clip of Dana Bash on CNN.
[01:53:01.043 --> 01:53:02.523]  It's so telling how they see men.
[01:53:02.543 --> 01:53:10.945]  Dana Bash argues that Democrats are trying to speak to men who might not be the testosterone-laden, gun-toting type.
[01:53:11.065 --> 01:53:11.845]  Oh, laden.
[01:53:12.626 --> 01:53:13.946]  Yeah, it's so bad we have testosterone.
[01:53:13.966 --> 01:53:15.386]  That's why our testosterone is down about 70% from 1950.
[01:53:15.426 --> 01:53:15.866]  Who might not
[01:53:20.151 --> 01:53:28.034]  The type of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and understand 2024 is okay to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman.
[01:53:28.054 --> 01:53:36.857]  It's not about a woman, it's about she's an evil witch who can't even hardly talk, who's a liar, and who's the border czar where all the human trafficking and hell happened.
[01:53:37.317 --> 01:53:37.857]  Here's that clip.
[01:53:39.147 --> 01:53:56.305]  But they are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of
[01:53:57.026 --> 01:54:20.535]  Testosterone-laden, you know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC, or might want to listen to that, but also, in addition, understand that it's okay in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman.
[01:54:20.955 --> 01:54:24.116]  And that's something that they really are trying to work on with
[01:54:25.106 --> 01:54:33.190]  All right, we're going to go to break in a few minutes and join a bunch of stations that don't carry this first five.
[01:54:34.071 --> 01:54:36.512]  Again, I've got so much we're going to be getting in today.
[01:54:36.532 --> 01:54:47.038]  It makes my head spin on industry, on the economy, more on the government emitting fluorides massively, lowered IQ in children.
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:51.563]  Now they're saying she was the Borders are and did the best job ever.
[01:54:51.603 --> 01:54:52.303]  It's all coming up.
[01:54:52.383 --> 01:54:55.045]  But I didn't plug one time last hour with Alfie Oaks on.
[01:54:55.726 --> 01:54:58.408]  Most Talk Radio plugs every segment because it takes that to stay on air.
[01:54:58.989 --> 01:54:59.909]  We're under attack.
[01:55:00.049 --> 01:55:00.950]  We need your support.
[01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:02.932]  We need you to make the decision to support the broadcast.
[01:55:03.632 --> 01:55:04.853]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:55:04.893 --> 01:55:06.775]  And maybe I shouldn't sit here and say support the show.
[01:55:07.375 --> 01:55:11.559]  Maybe I should just talk about how amazing our turmeric is, the strongest out there.
[01:55:12.279 --> 01:55:13.721]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:55:13.741 --> 01:55:14.562]  A very similar formula.
[01:55:14.582 --> 01:55:15.943]  It also has 95% Humanoid.
[01:55:16.304 --> 01:55:17.465]  Infowars MD.
[01:55:17.485 --> 01:55:18.647]  But the other things added to it.
[01:55:18.667 --> 01:55:20.529]  It's a little bit different formula, but it's the same turmeric.
[01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:22.031]  It's apples and oranges.
[01:55:22.071 --> 01:55:22.811]  They're both amazing.
[01:55:22.832 --> 01:55:23.552]  That's Turmeric 95.
[01:55:24.554 --> 01:55:28.819]  We have the CBD gummies and the CBD liquid that's wide spectrum and very strong.
[01:55:28.839 --> 01:55:29.660]  One of the strongest.
[01:55:30.865 --> 01:55:33.986]  Formulas out there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:34.026 --> 01:55:42.468]  Check out the InfoWars MD line of amazing products at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:46.009]  And then, we have our great sponsor, my dad's company.
[01:55:46.029 --> 01:55:51.430]  A lot of the supplements you can't get at InfoWarsStore.com anymore, you find at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:53.250]  Like TurboForce, but it's sold out.
[01:55:53.290 --> 01:55:54.251]  It's coming in a few weeks.
[01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:59.292]  But there is Next Level Foundational Energy that, again, is revolutionary, five-star rating.
[01:55:59.932 --> 01:56:03.654]  Cleans out your cells, gives you instant energy in like 30 minutes with no letdown.
[01:56:03.694 --> 01:56:07.496]  It's not a stimulant, but it has a clean, amazing stimulant effect.
[01:56:07.576 --> 01:56:13.060]  You want to get next level foundational energy at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:22.025]  There's all the nano silver toothpaste, the turmeric toothpaste, the activated charcoal toothpaste with no additives, no fluoride, all these key organic essential oils.
[01:56:23.012 --> 01:56:28.015]  At InfoWarStore.com, you find a lot of amazing products as well, and books and films and t-shirts and water filtration.
[01:56:28.356 --> 01:56:35.000]  But at DrJonesNaturals.com, you find all the nano silver products, the Rocket Rest, it's an incredible natural sleep aid.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:42.285]  We have the Top Brain, that is a really strong, clean, powerful combination of nootropics to give you incredible energy.
[01:56:42.725 --> 01:56:44.166]  So it is a stimulant, Top Brain.
[01:56:44.707 --> 01:56:50.310]  Cabochill gives you a natural relaxation, but without, you know, the effect like you get from something like Valium.
[01:56:50.771 --> 01:56:51.371]  It's amazing.
[01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:52.292]  Cabochill.
[01:56:52.972 --> 01:56:57.997]  DrJonesNaturals.com, the organic, high-end, multivitamin at a low price, immune support.
[01:56:58.398 --> 01:57:06.566]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com, and that's how we fund this operation in the face of the deep state and the giant battles we've been through.
[01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:09.509]  But we're only here because of your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support.
[01:57:09.529 --> 01:57:10.490]  These are amazing products.
[01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:11.771]  Please commit now.
[01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:13.253]  I want to thank all those that have.
[01:57:13.373 --> 01:57:18.641]  The majority of you have never gone to infowarestore.com or drjonesdackles.com and gotten these great products.
[01:57:18.661 --> 01:57:21.324]  These are amazing products and they fund the info war.
[01:57:21.525 --> 01:57:22.366]  They enrich your life.
[01:57:22.386 --> 01:57:23.808]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:57:24.108 --> 01:57:24.769]  I need your support.
[01:57:24.809 --> 01:57:25.510]  I'm asking humbly.
[01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:26.912]  Go to drjonesdackles.com.
[01:57:26.932 --> 01:57:27.373]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:32.412]  That I aired in the first hour.
[01:57:33.273 --> 01:57:43.103]  We added even more information to it, and it just went live on Real Alex Jones on X. I'm asking all of you out there, even if you're not on X, to go become a member at X. It's free.
[01:57:43.744 --> 01:57:47.888]  And to go to at Real Alex Jones and get this report and get it out.
[01:57:48.889 --> 01:57:49.489]  It just went up.
[01:57:49.989 --> 01:57:53.451]  Minutes ago, it's already gotten 80 plus thousand views.
[01:57:53.471 --> 01:57:54.951]  88 plus thousand views.
[01:57:54.971 --> 01:57:57.312]  You hit refresh, it's probably 100,000 in the last 20 seconds.
[01:57:58.032 --> 01:57:58.952]  Emergency alert!
[01:57:59.012 --> 01:58:01.573]  Deep State planning to assassinate Trump and frame Iran.
[01:58:01.993 --> 01:58:03.554]  Triggering World War III.
[01:58:04.514 --> 01:58:08.836]  Now, in the last 15 minutes, the first hour, I did an even deeper analysis on it.
[01:58:08.856 --> 01:58:10.916]  We'll be posting that as well.
[01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:14.998]  Learn how the Deep State plans to assassinate Trump, frame Iran,
[01:58:16.604 --> 01:58:19.965]  And trigger World War Three martial law.
[01:58:20.425 --> 01:58:20.965]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:58:21.025 --> 01:58:21.745]  I don't know how else.
[01:58:21.805 --> 01:58:22.925]  I mean, I don't just say this stuff.
[01:58:22.965 --> 01:58:23.566]  It sounds scary.
[01:58:24.326 --> 01:58:24.586]  Okay.
[01:58:24.846 --> 01:58:28.547]  And I predicted they would start blaming Iran days after they shot Trump and they did.
[01:58:28.567 --> 01:58:34.808]  And now it's a crescendo with the FBI saying, oh, the Iranians are coming to kill Trump right now.
[01:58:35.148 --> 01:58:36.849]  And maybe they were the ones that tried to kill him before.
[01:58:37.329 --> 01:58:42.830]  This is a big, big deal with only 74 days left until the election.
[01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:48.173]  All right, we have got an incredible presentation for you in the next 53 minutes before this hour ends.
[01:58:48.253 --> 01:58:49.714]  I asked him to do it even though he's very busy.
[01:58:50.154 --> 01:58:54.837]  Dr. Kirk Elliott is an amazing economist, and our last interview was huge on the radio stations.
[01:58:54.857 --> 01:58:55.658]  We got a lot of compliments.
[01:58:56.038 --> 01:58:57.379]  Huge at InfoWars, but as
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:03.582]  The main interview has 2 million views, and the subclips have another 2 million views.
[01:59:04.002 --> 01:59:07.264]  So, normally, you know, on economy stuff, it's hot, but not that hot.
[01:59:07.324 --> 01:59:12.366]  So, the stuff he was covering, people really asked him to come back to the deep dive he was talking about.
[01:59:12.566 --> 01:59:16.328]  What does the solid-state battery developed by Samsung mean?
[01:59:16.348 --> 01:59:18.930]  They can get 1,000 miles on a 9-minute charge.
[01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:20.110]  What does that mean for silver?
[01:59:20.150 --> 01:59:21.231]  Is the batteries made out of silver?
[01:59:22.171 --> 01:59:26.814]  Also, what's happening with the explosion of silver and gold continuing since he was just on Monday.
[01:59:27.274 --> 01:59:27.715]  The U.S.
[01:59:27.755 --> 01:59:28.215]  economy.
[01:59:28.275 --> 01:59:30.036]  Summary of the Fed's minutes.
[01:59:30.056 --> 01:59:31.117]  What the Federal Reserve is about to do.
[01:59:31.517 --> 01:59:31.737]  U.S.
[01:59:31.757 --> 01:59:35.499]  dollar becoming unhinged as the paper reserve quickly.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:36.980]  We've been talking about that.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:37.981]  Kamala Harris.
[01:59:38.301 --> 01:59:39.162]  The moral decay.
[01:59:39.242 --> 01:59:39.822]  The BRICS.
[01:59:40.462 --> 01:59:44.985]  Then we'll continue on with the yen carry trade and what that really symbolizes.
[01:59:45.406 --> 01:59:48.788]  And geopolitics with the great Dr. Kirk Elliott, an amazing
[01:59:49.428 --> 01:59:49.928]  We're good to go.
[02:00:13.067 --> 02:00:15.450]  They have incredible acceleration, but they have a lot of issues.
[02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:16.831]  They're being subsidized.
[02:00:16.851 --> 02:00:17.572]  They blow up.
[02:00:18.233 --> 02:00:22.217]  I think Musk has done the best job at deploying them, but even he has said we need fossil fuels.
[02:00:22.257 --> 02:00:28.203]  But you come out with an electric car, I can charge at my house cheaply, and it goes 1,000 miles on a nine-minute charge.
[02:00:29.024 --> 02:00:33.088]  I'll still keep, because I love the feeling of a big gas engine, you know, a Dodge Charger.
[02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:37.731]  But I'm telling you, this, this, this, this, this I will adopt.
[02:00:38.411 --> 02:00:44.495]  Again, I said, if they innovate the technology and can get it where it's not giant, you know, lithium mines with slaves in it, and it's just silver, boom.
[02:00:44.515 --> 02:00:45.775]  But what will that do to silver?
[02:00:46.176 --> 02:00:47.076]  It already has.
[02:00:47.096 --> 02:00:55.981]  I had a lot of questions I saw on your last interview on X. They said, well, if silver is so finite compared to gold, and you've got to make all these new things out of silver,
[02:00:56.781 --> 02:01:01.905]  Well, then, won't that make silver too expensive to get and make the batteries?
[02:01:01.925 --> 02:01:03.746]  Well, that kind of becomes an issue, doesn't it?
[02:01:03.786 --> 02:01:05.647]  That's why we're saying silver will explode.
[02:01:05.687 --> 02:01:08.869]  But from what I've read, he'll correct me if I'm wrong, but I kind of did a deep dive on this.
[02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:12.732]  With these batteries, much of the silver is recyclable.
[02:01:13.172 --> 02:01:15.795]  So this is very, very exciting stuff.
[02:01:16.115 --> 02:01:17.817]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, let's dive into that.
[02:01:17.917 --> 02:01:19.478]  Solid-state battery technology.
[02:01:20.099 --> 02:01:21.160]  Mega game-changer.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:27.026]  The real story behind Samsung's, now they're saying 600, but it says 1,000-mile solid-state battery.
[02:01:27.927 --> 02:01:30.049]  Long-term life solid-state batteries.
[02:01:31.573 --> 02:01:37.059]  Samsung to mass-produce solid-state batteries for super-premium EVs by 2027.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.364]  So we're a few years out from this, but now the process is beginning.
[02:01:41.705 --> 02:01:43.967]  So Dr. Kirk Elliott, thank you so much for being here with us.
[02:01:44.997 --> 02:01:46.678]  Well, it's so great to be with you.
[02:01:46.898 --> 02:01:59.128]  And when we talked about Samsung's delivery of these new solid-state batteries a couple days ago, I mean, literally, it was a massive explosion of interest in it.
[02:01:59.808 --> 02:02:07.694]  Because it's a shift in production of how electric vehicles are going to be made and powered, right?
[02:02:07.734 --> 02:02:09.616]  And this is a massive shift.
[02:02:09.676 --> 02:02:12.298]  To me, this is the biggest news
[02:02:13.198 --> 02:02:14.238]  We're good to go.
[02:02:34.003 --> 02:02:37.747]  Well, if you think of a normal battery like you have in your car, right?
[02:02:37.867 --> 02:02:39.208]  It's got liquid in there, right?
[02:02:39.248 --> 02:02:46.595]  And it's got a liquid electrolyte that energizes the ions, and that's what causes power, right?
[02:02:47.456 --> 02:02:50.319]  So with a solid-state battery, it's a solid core.
[02:02:50.559 --> 02:02:51.760]  The liquid is gone.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.321]  So it can be smaller.
[02:02:54.062 --> 02:02:55.623]  It's way more dense.
[02:02:56.243 --> 02:03:07.789]  So so the density of of a silver based solid state battery is like 500 watt hours versus like 270 for a normal battery.
[02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:09.030]  So what does that mean?
[02:03:09.070 --> 02:03:12.292]  That density means you can charge it up quicker.
[02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:19.396]  So when you can charge something up quicker, it'll be, people are going to want to use it more, right?
[02:03:19.416 --> 02:03:22.338]  Because I used to have an electric vehicle.
[02:03:22.378 --> 02:03:26.181]  I used to have a Tesla, I don't know, three, four years ago, maybe five.
[02:03:26.281 --> 02:03:27.942]  I can't remember, but I sold it.
[02:03:28.402 --> 02:03:35.546]  Because A, it didn't have a long enough range, and when I did run out of energy and I had to charge the dumb thing up, it took forever.
[02:03:35.566 --> 02:03:36.666]  I was like, oh my word.
[02:03:37.106 --> 02:03:40.228]  So I just went back to a gas-powered vehicle.
[02:03:40.308 --> 02:03:48.112]  But because this is a solid density core, you can charge it up really fast and not overheat the battery.
[02:03:49.082 --> 02:04:06.052]  So this is how they get that accelerated speed of charging down to 9 minutes to get a battery at 80% capacity that lasts 20 years where a liquid electrolyte core doesn't last nearly that long, maybe half that long.
[02:04:06.892 --> 02:04:07.092]  Right.
[02:04:07.232 --> 02:04:13.876]  And it has a 600 mile or 1000 kilometer range versus like three to four hundred of the normal battery.
[02:04:14.277 --> 02:04:22.542]  So you look at those those benefits of what this offers and why would an electric vehicle manufacturer
[02:04:23.482 --> 02:04:25.324]  Not want this new battery, right?
[02:04:25.384 --> 02:04:29.568]  I mean, good grief, it'll make the cars lighter, it's gonna have less material.
[02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:35.593]  Now, putting silver in it, each one of these batteries takes a kilogram of silver, which is 32.15 ounces.
[02:04:38.266 --> 02:04:46.877]  So, when you have that, and you're going to have this massive demand, right, so what happens next?
[02:04:47.417 --> 02:04:54.686]  See, this is where, already, outside of this, silver has been projected to actually run out.
[02:04:55.507 --> 02:05:06.449]  From the COMEX depositories in 2025 because of the military demand, the aerospace demand, the solar power, electronics, you know, everything that silver is used for.
[02:05:06.469 --> 02:05:17.132]  They're already at lows, you know, so so it's interesting after our last conversation, you know, show that we had, which was I think it was two days ago.
[02:05:18.192 --> 02:05:22.637]  I talked to an InfoWars viewer that was watching the show.
[02:05:24.059 --> 02:05:24.960]  Brilliant guy.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.706]  Happens to be in the automotive industry in exactly the space that we're talking about.
[02:05:29.746 --> 02:05:33.090]  He was in Germany and he was saying, Kirk, I gotta talk to you.
[02:05:33.690 --> 02:05:36.951]  I gotta get some silver, because what you were saying was spot on.
[02:05:37.372 --> 02:05:49.236]  In the manufacturing world, that kind of demand for a new product that will actually change the way that cars are manufactured for the electric vehicle market is huge.
[02:05:49.516 --> 02:05:52.837]  And so I said, so what is the time frame on that?
[02:05:52.898 --> 02:05:58.880]  Like, if they're just introducing this battery now, it's like, how long until deployment?
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:02.982]  We're saying it won't be this next model year, but the one after that.
[02:06:03.002 --> 02:06:08.946]  So probably two model years, and it will be implemented in a lot of these electric vehicles.
[02:06:08.986 --> 02:06:16.832]  But he said with that, they have to start ramping up production, they have to start ramping up inventory to make sure that they have enough.
[02:06:17.052 --> 02:06:22.596]  That's right, let me just stop because when I make a mistake, let me just stop, when I make a mistake, I'm the first to correct because we don't get stuff wrong on purpose.
[02:06:23.516 --> 02:06:26.837]  It's 1,000 kilometer per nine minute charge, 600 mile.
[02:06:27.298 --> 02:06:29.718]  So that's where I got it wrong when I said 1,000 miles.
[02:06:29.778 --> 02:06:31.079]  Still, 600 is incredible.
[02:06:31.299 --> 02:06:32.379]  And I've been reading the literature.
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:35.461]  They admit they're easier, cheaper to make, and less toxic.
[02:06:35.481 --> 02:06:40.382]  You don't need these giant, horrible, you know, gaping mines with African children as slaves in them.
[02:06:40.783 --> 02:06:42.783]  And so that's also why it's such a game changer.
[02:06:42.823 --> 02:06:48.606]  But the bigger thing is, even if it had a 500 mile range, the nine minute charge is the king.
[02:06:49.526 --> 02:06:50.526]  And that's what they confirm.
[02:06:50.766 --> 02:06:51.367]  Nine minutes.
[02:06:51.407 --> 02:06:51.687]  Go ahead.
[02:06:51.707 --> 02:06:51.927]  Sorry.
[02:06:53.314 --> 02:06:57.075]  No, that's huge, and it keeps the power for longer, right?
[02:06:57.455 --> 02:07:14.620]  So this gentleman that I was talking to said, with a 2027, you know, kind of implementation date, two years, two models down the road for these electric vehicles, which is what that second article I showed you said, it's going to be, you know, ready by 2027.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:20.541]  They have to start allocating the inventory, the silver, to Purdue.
[02:07:20.581 --> 02:07:22.102]  Now, one kilogram
[02:07:22.802 --> 02:07:23.042]  You know,
[02:07:42.443 --> 02:07:50.146]  The article that I had sent you from Electronic Design, mass production by 2027, right?
[02:07:50.426 --> 02:07:54.267]  So it's not just electric vehicles that will want this.
[02:07:54.968 --> 02:08:01.570]  You've got these big wind farms that store the energy from the big windmills into batteries.
[02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:08.393]  Well, why wouldn't you want this that can actually store more and be lighter and be smaller and regenerate quicker?
[02:08:09.013 --> 02:08:17.220]  Right, so then you've also got every other component of any battery, ultimately, can use this technology.
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:22.784]  They'll last longer, they'll charge quicker, they'll be safer, they don't overheat.
[02:08:23.405 --> 02:08:30.150]  Imagine some of these things like submarines or these big cargo ships, right?
[02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:34.794]  I was about to say, they won't need nuclear reactors on submarines anymore, but expanding on that,
[02:08:36.333 --> 02:08:37.234]  It's just amazing.
[02:08:37.334 --> 02:08:38.954]  I was trying to research the literature and it wasn't clear.
[02:08:38.974 --> 02:08:41.335]  They said some of the silver will be recyclable.
[02:08:42.015 --> 02:08:43.596]  What happens to the silver in this process?
[02:08:43.616 --> 02:08:46.577]  And then, of course, we know other companies are going to get similar patents.
[02:08:46.917 --> 02:08:48.278]  This is going to revolutionize everything.
[02:08:49.738 --> 02:09:01.623]  Well, yeah, because when you have just Samsung is doing it right now, but other companies are going to start to come into this mix because they're going to realize this technology is so amazing.
[02:09:02.064 --> 02:09:03.584]  And what's that going to do?
[02:09:04.105 --> 02:09:07.986]  I don't care if it's Samsung or Sony or, you know, Duracell.
[02:09:08.026 --> 02:09:10.387]  Who cares what company is doing it?
[02:09:10.848 --> 02:09:17.711]  When you have other companies now that see the dramatic impact that this is going to have on an entire industry,
[02:09:18.191 --> 02:09:20.334]  You're going to have other companies that jump into the fold.
[02:09:20.354 --> 02:09:21.035]  Well, let me raise this.
[02:09:21.075 --> 02:09:30.408]  Look at the problem with these big railway cars that are giant chemical batteries to try to store wind power because the problem is you can only get wind power while the wind's going, so you need to store it so you can use it during peak times.
[02:09:30.628 --> 02:09:33.271]  This is going to be great for storing that energy as well.
[02:09:34.602 --> 02:09:39.166]  And storing the power that comes from solar, you know, panels, right?
[02:09:39.786 --> 02:10:02.043]  So, as I was thinking about it, it's like, this technology, because it is so advanced and so needed, and to make actually electricity, you know, a more viable thing, because, you know, I know that the environmentalists want it, but, you know, building these toxic batteries, like you just addressed, I mean, it's awful.
[02:10:02.543 --> 02:10:06.706]  They're massively toxic to the environment, but yet, oh, we want clean energy, right?
[02:10:06.746 --> 02:10:10.628]  It's like, well, now you could actually have clean energy.
[02:10:11.269 --> 02:10:26.479]  And so when I look at the demand and the pent-up demand and the third article that I sent you on this solid-state battery, it just talks about Hyundai, Stellantis, and GM are already testing the prototypes.
[02:10:26.859 --> 02:10:28.160]  They started last year.
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:31.442]  So oddly enough, this isn't a crazy new story.
[02:10:31.482 --> 02:10:34.844]  Now, we just broke it two days ago, right?
[02:10:35.204 --> 02:10:48.353]  But Samsung has been utilizing prototypes and sending them to these old car manufacturers already since the end of last year, and the feedback is incredible.
[02:10:49.013 --> 02:10:57.221]  So now you're retooling, you're going to retool some of these factories and start using this product in future development of vehicles.
[02:10:58.002 --> 02:11:06.309]  And this is where we can be ahead of already a fast accelerating curve in precious metals.
[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:08.732]  And when everybody's complaining that
[02:11:09.824 --> 02:11:11.284]  The stock market is failing.
[02:11:11.605 --> 02:11:13.765]  The bond market's absolutely tanking.
[02:11:14.085 --> 02:11:14.925]  What are we going to do?
[02:11:14.945 --> 02:11:16.906]  The foundations around us are eroding.
[02:11:17.246 --> 02:11:17.686]  You know what?
[02:11:17.906 --> 02:11:22.628]  These are one of those kind of, I don't know, I think of like AI.
[02:11:22.688 --> 02:11:24.608]  I think of like when Google started.
[02:11:25.508 --> 02:11:27.589]  I think when Apple created the iPhone.
[02:11:27.609 --> 02:11:35.491]  You know, one of those pendulum shifting moments where this is going to change the way that manufacturing is done.
[02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:37.892]  Well, I think it's going to be bigger because I'm reading over not just
[02:11:37.892 --> 02:11:38.252]  We're good to go.
[02:11:57.856 --> 02:11:58.097]  Yeah.
[02:11:58.557 --> 02:12:05.087]  I mean, this is like the discovery of the combustion engine, basically, because like I said, these electric cars are super toxic.
[02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:07.151]  They don't charge well.
[02:12:07.732 --> 02:12:08.853]  They don't work in cold weather.
[02:12:08.893 --> 02:12:10.456]  I was reading this works in cold weather, too.
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:12.880]  I mean, it looks like this is a game changer.
[02:12:14.545 --> 02:12:29.434]  It is an absolute game changer, and this is why I wanted to spend more time on a second show talking about it, because we just covered it briefly, got a couple million views of that, and everyone was, like, excited about it, but there's more to it than just electric vehicles.
[02:12:30.054 --> 02:12:45.749]  There's solar power, there's transport ships, there's submarines, there's missiles, there's torpedoes, there's solar power, there's... You look at all the applications that actually are going to ultimately use this... Well, this is going to strip out all other battery technology.
[02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:49.401]  Yeah, I don't see why it wouldn't, quite honestly.
[02:12:49.841 --> 02:13:08.616]  I mean, who wants those big, heavy, toxic hydrogen cell, or whatever they are, electrolyte batteries, when you can have something that's smaller, and you can have something that actually holds more power, and it can get you more power, more speed, more quickly, last longer, go faster, I mean, this is what everybody wants.
[02:13:08.717 --> 02:13:13.781]  I'll say it again, I mean, it's moral, because, you know, silver mines are a lot less toxic than this, but people that don't know about
[02:13:14.361 --> 02:13:17.522]  Lithium and cobalt and all these you know 100 plus rare earth minerals.
[02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:20.964]  There's tiny amounts of it on average in the soil deposits they get it.
[02:13:21.244 --> 02:13:26.687]  So they have to haul out it depends on what what they're looking for but like 20 tons to get an ounce.
[02:13:26.787 --> 02:13:27.747]  I mean it's insane.
[02:13:28.087 --> 02:13:33.029]  Then they've got to crush it all down all this other toxic stuff runs out and who are they using to mine it?
[02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:34.990]  The average age like 15 year olds.
[02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.871]  We can show video of that.
[02:13:36.611 --> 02:13:40.379]  But separately from the moral issue, it's the charging time!
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:43.385]  I mean, that's what makes these electric cars a joke!
[02:13:44.006 --> 02:13:46.231]  I mean, I went to Florida to give a speech.
[02:13:47.259 --> 02:13:55.701]  Last year, and the place that had me come speak, great folks, the River Church, wanted to be nice, so they got me a nice Mercedes electric car.
[02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:57.382]  Number one, it was scary as hell.
[02:13:57.402 --> 02:13:59.322]  The acceleration was Darth Vader level.
[02:13:59.362 --> 02:14:00.663]  I mean, it was like, I thought I was in a TIE fighter.
[02:14:01.663 --> 02:14:03.963]  And my wife was driving, and she's like, oh my God, you barely touch it.
[02:14:03.983 --> 02:14:04.944]  You're going like 100 miles an hour.
[02:14:06.144 --> 02:14:13.026]  But the damn thing going back and forth to the church was already dead, so they plug it in at the parking garage for us at the hotel.
[02:14:13.786 --> 02:14:15.427]  For like 14 to 12 hours.
[02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:18.347]  We come out the next day, it's a third charged.
[02:14:18.988 --> 02:14:21.488]  And even these super fast charging stages would take an hour.
[02:14:21.748 --> 02:14:23.729]  I don't have time to sit around at Bucky's for an hour.
[02:14:23.749 --> 02:14:25.690]  Go ahead.
[02:14:25.710 --> 02:14:25.850]  Yeah.
[02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:27.050]  Nobody does.
[02:14:27.490 --> 02:14:29.311]  You're not the only one, right?
[02:14:29.531 --> 02:14:32.972]  Pretty much everybody that has an electric vehicle, that's their complaint.
[02:14:33.786 --> 02:14:34.746]  That's the complaint.
[02:14:35.287 --> 02:14:37.247]  This solves that complaint, right?
[02:14:37.347 --> 02:14:41.949]  So here's what I see coming with that, and here's the dilemma.
[02:14:42.009 --> 02:14:47.131]  It's like, this is one of those technologies like, of course this is a no-brainer, we're going to go down that road.
[02:14:47.631 --> 02:14:56.394]  Now the problem is, these batteries are going to cost more because silver is more expensive than whatever, you know, electrolyte liquid they put in these batteries, right?
[02:14:57.654 --> 02:15:11.240]  I don't think the manufacturers are going to care, because it's going to ultimately take less material, take less space, make the cars lighter, people are going to enjoy it more, and so they'll just pass that extra cost on to the consumer.
[02:15:12.210 --> 02:15:18.898]  And people will not care if you've got a car that now has a 600 mile range and charges in nine minutes.
[02:15:19.258 --> 02:15:20.800]  They're not going to care.
[02:15:21.561 --> 02:15:24.364]  Let me put a fly on the ointment here because I'm all about innovation.
[02:15:24.384 --> 02:15:28.048]  I've been against electric cars since I'm paid by the oil companies or I'm against innovation.
[02:15:28.108 --> 02:15:29.470]  It's that it's a bridge to nowhere.
[02:15:29.890 --> 02:15:32.573]  They're shutting down the coal plants, the gas plants, the other plants.
[02:15:33.214 --> 02:15:34.135]  All the studies are there.
[02:15:34.335 --> 02:15:36.035]  The grid could fail right now.
[02:15:36.075 --> 02:15:37.216]  It's already failing in many areas.
[02:15:37.576 --> 02:15:39.317]  And the electric cars are sapping.
[02:15:39.337 --> 02:15:43.719]  And so as more electric cars go online, they're not building enough grid to charge them.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:45.240]  I think that's going to be the problem.
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:47.261]  But regardless, they're going to produce these cars with this.
[02:15:47.561 --> 02:15:49.662]  Silver's going to keep exploding just because of inflation alone.
[02:15:49.722 --> 02:15:51.743]  But as an economist, how do you see that?
[02:15:53.084 --> 02:15:53.645]  Affecting things.
[02:15:53.665 --> 02:15:56.109]  The fact that there won't be enough energy grid to supply these.
[02:15:56.629 --> 02:16:00.095]  I guess we'll have to take our governments back and make sure we turn the coal power plants back on.
[02:16:00.235 --> 02:16:03.620]  Because at the end of the day, solar can't keep up, wind can't keep up.
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:06.304]  We need to go back to old-fashioned coal to charge these things.
[02:16:07.506 --> 02:16:09.447]  You're ultimately going to have to, right?
[02:16:09.487 --> 02:16:12.669]  And so this is the battle that people are going to start to pick and choose.
[02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:15.531]  It's like, yeah, I'm not going to have this carbon emission vehicle.
[02:16:16.271 --> 02:16:18.553]  And even today, this is the stupid argument.
[02:16:18.593 --> 02:16:23.616]  They don't realize that it takes these coal factories to produce the energy to charge your electric vehicles, right?
[02:16:24.156 --> 02:16:43.832]  So I do think that we're going to actually enter into this quasi-type world where there is still carbon emissions and there's coal energy plants and you're going to have electricity and wind and solar and hydro and normal coal and nuclear.
[02:16:44.012 --> 02:16:45.814]  Everything is going to be working.
[02:16:45.834 --> 02:16:46.254]  And thermal.
[02:16:47.635 --> 02:16:48.255]  On thermal?
[02:16:48.295 --> 02:16:49.116]  Yeah, together.
[02:16:49.136 --> 02:16:54.638]  I mean, just the mining of like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, right?
[02:16:54.658 --> 02:16:56.218]  I mean, that takes a ton of energy.
[02:16:56.238 --> 02:16:58.859]  Speaking of thermal, down in El Salvador they use a volcano to do it.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:16:59.440]  That's smart.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:03.221]  Yeah, that's crazy smart, right?
[02:17:03.621 --> 02:17:06.422]  Well, El Salvador is doing a lot of really good things right now.
[02:17:06.683 --> 02:17:12.825]  They used to be like this backwards nation that's like, oh my word, they're like on the cusp of freedom and everything else.
[02:17:12.885 --> 02:17:14.886]  I mean, they're doing a lot of stuff right, but
[02:17:15.566 --> 02:17:26.092]  But as we look, Alex, into the future, and I'm not being a prophet or, you know, not looking decades, 20 years in the future, I'm just talking about like next year, right?
[02:17:26.632 --> 02:17:29.594]  So, so there's going to be this demand for silver.
[02:17:29.614 --> 02:17:31.795]  And I was reading this, this article.
[02:17:33.396 --> 02:17:35.898]  About Shanghai silver storage.
[02:17:36.018 --> 02:17:36.659]  It's plummeting.
[02:17:36.699 --> 02:17:38.140]  They don't have enough.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.363]  The vaults in China are just bleeding.
[02:17:42.744 --> 02:17:44.625]  They're running out of silver.
[02:17:45.186 --> 02:17:48.768]  So it's resumed because it was static for a bit.
[02:17:48.808 --> 02:17:54.233]  Now the basically bleeding of silver leaving the vaults has commenced.
[02:17:54.673 --> 02:17:58.757]  The Shanghai silver vaults sink below a thousand tons for the first time ever.
[02:17:59.057 --> 02:18:00.518]  Down 71 tons in a week.
[02:18:03.541 --> 02:18:09.372]  37 tons were withdrawn from the vaults yesterday and 28 tons the day before.
[02:18:09.412 --> 02:18:10.373]  It's like... Stop there!
[02:18:10.434 --> 02:18:12.517]  Explain, we're not an economist, what this means.
[02:18:13.717 --> 02:18:37.288]  So that means when it's leaving the vault, people are either taking possession of it, the manufacturers of the world, so you've got investor demand, right, which is actually a small portion of the demand, but you've got manufacturing demand, like the Samsungs, the Sonys, the Teslas, everybody that needs it.
[02:18:37.348 --> 02:18:40.530]  So to me, I think the biggest need
[02:18:41.210 --> 02:18:41.731]  We're good.
[02:18:56.468 --> 02:18:57.949]  Maybe for this battery power.
[02:18:58.349 --> 02:19:03.853]  Maybe because they're potentially wanting to go to war against Taiwan or the United States.
[02:19:04.153 --> 02:19:08.196]  They're having to build up their military weapon complex, which all uses silver.
[02:19:08.576 --> 02:19:15.421]  Every single ICBM missile and those big torpedoes need about 11,000 ounces of silver each.
[02:19:16.141 --> 02:19:22.647]  So, I don't think it's coincidental, Alex, that the Shanghai vaults are running out of silver.
[02:19:23.107 --> 02:19:26.070]  But this is the world that I live in every single day.
[02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:36.259]  Calling the depositories, COMEX depositories are running out of silver, which is why it's projected that we're going to actually extinguish the supply in 2025.
[02:19:36.579 --> 02:19:36.960]  Which means what?
[02:19:39.582 --> 02:19:46.504]  Supply and demand, economics 101, low supplier, no supply, and high demand, and prices go through the ceiling.
[02:19:46.724 --> 02:19:47.304]  All right, stay there.
[02:19:47.324 --> 02:19:48.505]  Let's come back and continue on this.
[02:19:48.525 --> 02:19:50.145]  We've only gotten into like 20% of the stack.
[02:19:50.565 --> 02:19:53.226]  You sent me there's so many other huge angles.
[02:19:53.846 --> 02:20:02.069]  We're about to be hitting with Dr. Kirk Elliott, all of this straight ahead, Moral Precious Metals, the US economy, the DNC, and they're trying to kill Trump again and blame it on Iran.
[02:20:02.089 --> 02:20:02.469]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.949 --> 02:20:05.970]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 win.
[02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:09.051]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:20:09.451 --> 02:20:14.214]  When you have some game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[02:20:14.614 --> 02:20:20.497]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.
[02:20:20.977 --> 02:20:31.083]  When you visit DrJonesNaturals.com, you're not just supporting our broadcast by getting the products, you're getting game-changing products that really, really work and are amazing.

[02:20:52.807 --> 02:20:57.228]  So please, follow the links below to DrJonesNaturals.com, and I thank you for your support.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:20.874]  And for breaking news and updates be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones here on X. I want to just pause here for a moment at 1.33 Central Standard Time on the Alex Jones Show and thank my family, thank the crew, thank our supporters and sponsors like Dr. Kirk Elliott and of course thank God above for his divine protection and discernment and for leading, guiding and directing us in this fight.
[02:21:22.415 --> 02:21:25.717]  We have to really pull back for a moment and look at how insane the world is.
[02:21:25.837 --> 02:21:32.900]  The globalists admit they're bringing us into a time of tumult and great danger and war to bring in their world government and their total control.
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:38.823]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray, as it's been said, and go awry.
[02:21:38.983 --> 02:21:41.004]  And so things aren't going exactly the way they wanted.
[02:21:41.064 --> 02:21:42.445]  In fact, things are bad with the globalists.
[02:21:43.045 --> 02:21:45.066]  That's only making them double down.
[02:21:45.086 --> 02:21:46.086]  But people are waking up.
[02:21:47.207 --> 02:21:51.009]  AP's reporting fluoride's a horrible evil and lowered the US IQ by 15 points.
[02:21:55.390 --> 02:22:00.715]  Just bombshell after bombshell, God's giving us a chance to wake up and say no to this new world order and reject it.
[02:22:00.875 --> 02:22:06.500]  So, I only promote things that I feel really good about.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.582]  I mean, for me, doing the right thing,
[02:22:09.949 --> 02:22:10.549]  It's fun.
[02:22:11.149 --> 02:22:13.550]  That's just how I was born, how I was raised.
[02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:16.631]  I can get angry and get nasty, but I usually catch myself.
[02:22:16.651 --> 02:22:19.211]  But I don't consciously think about doing bad things.
[02:22:19.231 --> 02:22:21.612]  I don't get mad at people that are successful if they didn't steal it.
[02:22:22.352 --> 02:22:25.413]  You can have anything you want, just you better not take it from me, as they say in the jungle.
[02:22:26.373 --> 02:22:29.073]  But I really want to treat people like I want to be treated.
[02:22:29.093 --> 02:22:33.595]  I really feel like something done to somebody whose innocence being done to me, that's empathy.
[02:22:33.635 --> 02:22:35.195]  God put that in our hearts, in our DNA.
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:42.027]  So when I sell a water filtration system, it's the best rated at the price you're gonna pay.
[02:22:42.908 --> 02:22:43.549]  The highest rated.
[02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:47.154]  There's four or five others that are just as good out of over a hundred different systems.
[02:22:47.655 --> 02:22:50.158]  Ours is the lowest price out there for a unit that does this low.
[02:22:50.859 --> 02:22:53.703]  I could obviously sell it for more and have no money problems, but...
[02:22:55.054 --> 02:22:57.576]  People trust me because they know that that's not the case.
[02:22:57.596 --> 02:22:59.117]  They know I'm actually giving you the best deal I can.
[02:22:59.617 --> 02:23:02.499]  I can sell you crappy supplements for half the price and make even more money.
[02:23:02.619 --> 02:23:03.040]  Don't do it.
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:03.920]  Sell you the best quality.
[02:23:04.661 --> 02:23:05.822]  And it's such a no-brainer.
[02:23:05.942 --> 02:23:08.644]  You haven't heard a gold or silver sponsor here for 12, 13 years.
[02:23:09.584 --> 02:23:18.330]  Because the industry, gold and silver is great, is so corrupt, so out of control, because there's not knowledge about it, that most places are charging a 30% premium on it.
[02:23:19.211 --> 02:23:20.632]  Or some places double that.
[02:23:20.652 --> 02:23:21.533]  60, you know, 100.
[02:23:21.653 --> 02:23:24.095]  And then those places can pay you
[02:23:25.254 --> 02:23:27.795]  Massive amounts of money to rip off people.
[02:23:28.635 --> 02:23:30.976]  Now, you sell less gold, but you sell it for a lot more.
[02:23:31.797 --> 02:23:32.177]  Not me.
[02:23:32.857 --> 02:23:45.102]  Now, I've had sponsors that were great before that would pitch people, you know, bullying and stuff, but also if they wanted collector stuff, they'd sell them that, and then they give them a good price for the collectible, but still, it's hard to sell back, it's speculative, whatever.
[02:23:45.623 --> 02:23:46.583]  And sometimes the collectible's great.
[02:23:47.063 --> 02:23:48.344]  That's not what Dr. Kirk Elliott does.
[02:23:48.484 --> 02:23:48.604]  It's
[02:23:49.284 --> 02:23:50.085]  Wholesale price.
[02:23:50.105 --> 02:23:51.767]  When you see spot, that's coming out of the ground.
[02:23:52.128 --> 02:23:57.354]  Wholesale's a little bit, a few percentage higher because the cost of delivery and storage and shipping and all that.
[02:23:57.875 --> 02:24:00.798]  He has the best prices on silver and gold wholesale out there.
[02:24:01.139 --> 02:24:02.040]  The best ratings.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:06.525]  There's an 8% on it to pay for his crew and his advisory and his system.
[02:24:06.545 --> 02:24:07.206]  You can sell it back.
[02:24:07.887 --> 02:24:08.407]  For nothing.
[02:24:08.447 --> 02:24:09.508]  That is a huge value.
[02:24:10.049 --> 02:24:12.270]  Any other even reputable company can't even do that.
[02:24:12.691 --> 02:24:14.372]  He does it through mass volume.
[02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:15.773]  Nobody else can operate like he does.
[02:24:16.053 --> 02:24:18.035]  He's the biggest silver broker in the United States.
[02:24:18.415 --> 02:24:21.898]  He would be the biggest gold, but he hasn't moved into that yet because silver is the one that moved the most.
[02:24:22.278 --> 02:24:26.521]  I've got all these mainline articles here saying $200 an ounce in the next year.
[02:24:26.661 --> 02:24:27.622]  I'm not guaranteeing that.
[02:24:27.682 --> 02:24:28.423]  I can't guarantee anything.
[02:24:28.443 --> 02:24:29.383]  Might be a nuclear war tomorrow.
[02:24:29.704 --> 02:24:31.445]  But one of the smartest moves is silver.
[02:24:31.505 --> 02:24:33.066]  Then he's a huge sponsor of the show.
[02:24:33.426 --> 02:24:36.349]  You're getting the best deal, the best service, the best ratings.
[02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:37.929]  Delivered to you.
[02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:41.152]  All the advice you need from great people.
[02:24:41.232 --> 02:24:42.473]  That's why it doesn't happen right away.
[02:24:42.493 --> 02:24:47.318]  Maybe take a few days for me to get back with you because I got such amount of calls and they don't rush you through this.
[02:24:47.859 --> 02:24:51.603]  And then you're getting the very best deal you're going to get and you're supporting the broadcast.
[02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:54.465]  That is a total 360 win a non zero sum game.
[02:24:54.866 --> 02:24:55.326]  I want you.
[02:24:56.167 --> 02:25:07.537]  To go to KEPM.com forward slash gold KEPM.com forward slash gold or call 720-605-3900 and leave them your name and number.
[02:25:07.617 --> 02:25:15.463]  They may actually answer, but their phones are flooded and we'll put the number back on screen 720-605-3900.
[02:25:15.964 --> 02:25:16.324]  Call them.
[02:25:16.344 --> 02:25:17.886]  They'll call you back to a consultation.
[02:25:17.926 --> 02:25:20.428]  Talk about your hopes, your dreams, what you want to do.
[02:25:21.048 --> 02:25:24.691]  But just I would get in there now ahead of what's going on and it supports the broadcast.
[02:25:24.731 --> 02:25:26.673]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:25:26.693 --> 02:25:28.815]  You go there, we get the support with the sponsorship.
[02:25:28.875 --> 02:25:33.158]  As he gets more support, we get more sponsorship and we are able to stay on air and expand hopefully.
[02:25:33.859 --> 02:25:35.500]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 72060539007206053900.
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:35.740]  Okay.
[02:25:42.446 --> 02:25:45.489]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, let's launch back into new Shanghai data.
[02:25:45.549 --> 02:25:51.033]  Silver vaults vanishing, silver drained, triple digits, silver 2025 in the boom, just like that.
[02:25:51.774 --> 02:25:52.694]  We've got all these graphs.
[02:25:52.754 --> 02:25:53.315]  Please continue.
[02:25:54.465 --> 02:25:54.625]  Yeah.
[02:25:55.325 --> 02:25:57.627]  So, we'll finish up with the Chinese vaults, right?
[02:25:57.687 --> 02:26:02.749]  So, why could their vaults be diminishing or liquidating their silver so quick?
[02:26:03.249 --> 02:26:05.390]  I think it's because of military use, right?
[02:26:05.450 --> 02:26:07.732]  I think that China's gearing up for something.
[02:26:07.772 --> 02:26:09.452]  That's just a no-brainer.
[02:26:09.492 --> 02:26:11.093]  We see what they're doing with Taiwan.
[02:26:11.133 --> 02:26:14.235]  We see the warships, you know, off the coast of Florida.
[02:26:14.255 --> 02:26:15.595]  We see everything that's happening.
[02:26:15.635 --> 02:26:18.617]  Well, they officially ordered two years ago the biggest gear up ever.
[02:26:20.578 --> 02:26:22.440]  Yeah, and we're seeing it.
[02:26:22.961 --> 02:26:29.688]  So they're going to need silver for their missiles and their torpedoes and their ammunition, right?
[02:26:30.229 --> 02:26:31.891]  So I think that that's why.
[02:26:32.612 --> 02:26:37.417]  Also, China's the largest manufacturer in the world of most things, right?
[02:26:37.437 --> 02:26:40.541]  So maybe even Samsung, being a Korean company,
[02:26:41.121 --> 02:26:45.765]  Right, China wants to not let Korea beat them in anything, right?
[02:26:46.265 --> 02:26:48.467]  So maybe they're getting on this bandwagon too.
[02:26:48.587 --> 02:26:52.590]  All that we know is their vaults are being eliminated.
[02:26:52.650 --> 02:26:55.332]  Those are just two possible reasons, right?
[02:26:55.392 --> 02:27:01.076]  So now, this scarcity of silver that we're seeing around the world
[02:27:02.111 --> 02:27:02.551]  I think.
[02:27:02.971 --> 02:27:11.374]  And, you know, I've been saying this for a while, and now some of the other research articles are basically corresponding with what you and I have been saying, Alex.
[02:27:11.434 --> 02:27:12.574]  It's kind of wild.
[02:27:13.074 --> 02:27:15.595]  But triple digit silver by the year 2025.
[02:27:15.835 --> 02:27:20.517]  Now, I've been saying for literally
[02:27:21.577 --> 02:27:22.758]  Almost a decade, right?
[02:27:22.998 --> 02:27:27.340]  You're gonna have these ups, you're gonna have two steps forward, one step back, two steps forward, one step back in any market.
[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:35.864]  But I've said $75 to $100 an ounce silver because this is what happened in 2011.
[02:27:36.404 --> 02:27:43.408]  When silver was at $12 and it went to $48 in about six months, okay, that's a massive, like, easily 300% gain, right?
[02:27:43.428 --> 02:27:44.748]  So we start at $25, that gets us to $75 to $100.
[02:27:44.788 --> 02:27:45.789]  I'm very comfortable
[02:27:50.891 --> 02:27:51.392]  We're good to go.
[02:28:16.172 --> 02:28:17.032]  Where are we now?
[02:28:17.573 --> 02:28:20.153]  We're like 29, right?
[02:28:20.514 --> 02:28:23.775]  So getting to those levels is a massive multiplier.
[02:28:23.795 --> 02:28:27.596]  And like you, I'm not God, I don't control the markets, we're not making a guarantee.
[02:28:28.276 --> 02:28:39.740]  But here's where even if I'm 75% off the biggest economic dunce in the world, I get an absolute F minus, 75% wrong.
[02:28:41.641 --> 02:28:46.944]  When the projections are at 200, 75% off of that is like 50.
[02:28:47.364 --> 02:28:52.807]  We still have massive room left if I'm the biggest dunce in the world, right?
[02:28:53.227 --> 02:28:56.969]  So this is where when our goal is to minimize risk and maximize return.
[02:28:57.449 --> 02:28:59.872]  This is the actual place to be.
[02:28:59.992 --> 02:29:11.663]  Now, there's something really interesting in one of those charts that I sent off to you, and that is how silver gained more than 300% on average in the last three rate reductions, right?
[02:29:11.744 --> 02:29:13.786]  So, if we look at that chart,
[02:29:14.915 --> 02:29:27.266]  We go back to the year 2000, and you look at what happened in 2001, that bottom kind of tan line with the red circles on it, that's the federal funds rate.
[02:29:27.586 --> 02:29:32.811]  So the federal funds rate came down in 2001 to try to stimulate the economy after 9-11.
[02:29:33.051 --> 02:29:34.613]  What happened to silver after that?
[02:29:35.213 --> 02:29:35.313]  Up 412%.
[02:29:38.666 --> 02:29:39.326]  We're good to go.
[02:29:56.192 --> 02:29:56.572]  A year.
[02:29:56.592 --> 02:29:58.693]  I mean, it was incredible, right?
[02:29:58.733 --> 02:30:04.136]  So then you fast forward, the rates stayed low, artificially low, zero interest rate policy forever.
[02:30:04.976 --> 02:30:09.278]  Rates started going down again during COVID.
[02:30:10.039 --> 02:30:10.979]  And what happened?
[02:30:11.019 --> 02:30:13.300]  It went up 143% since then.
[02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:21.544]  And now we've got all these rate increases because the economy is on an inflationary fire, this inflationary spiral.
[02:30:22.164 --> 02:30:23.465]  And so rates have gone up.
[02:30:23.525 --> 02:30:25.126]  And now what is the Fed talking about?
[02:30:25.546 --> 02:30:31.048]  Jerome Powell saying, we've got to lower rates, you know, 150 basis points next year.
[02:30:31.688 --> 02:30:32.129]  You know, that's 1.5%.
[02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:37.170]  They're talking about another quarter to 50% rate reduction in September.
[02:30:37.411 --> 02:30:38.411]  We'll see what we get.
[02:30:38.991 --> 02:30:45.314]  These are temporary things because they can't keep the interest rates low when they haven't tackled inflation.
[02:30:45.414 --> 02:30:50.616]  But when this interest rate comes down, which they're going to do, other countries have already started it.
[02:30:51.616 --> 02:30:53.016]  Well, what are we expecting now?
[02:30:53.476 --> 02:31:03.679]  Potentially triple digits in silver, because the last, the average, when the Fed funds rate starts to come down, is a 300% gain.
[02:31:04.459 --> 02:31:11.440]  Alex, this is fantastic news for people that own silver, because this is what happens when the rates are reduced.
[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:13.521]  It doesn't even have to be a huge rate reduction.
[02:31:14.241 --> 02:31:18.503]  Just the perception that this is actually starting to happen will cause silver to go up.
[02:31:19.204 --> 02:31:22.205]  So, now, look at this last chart.
[02:31:22.426 --> 02:31:25.607]  What do precious metals do when the dollar collapses?
[02:31:26.208 --> 02:31:28.949]  They go up as a flight for quality.
[02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:35.152]  As the dollar diminishes in value, it takes more of that junk currency to buy valuable goods and services.
[02:31:35.193 --> 02:31:36.373]  That's what inflation is.
[02:31:36.893 --> 02:31:41.136]  So a declining dollar is going to cause gold and silver to go up.
[02:31:41.656 --> 02:31:42.837]  Well, look at this last chart.
[02:31:42.898 --> 02:31:43.979]  What's the dollar doing?
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:47.323]  It's falling off the face of the planet, right?
[02:31:47.723 --> 02:31:49.626]  The dollar is in free fall.
[02:31:49.946 --> 02:31:53.370]  So what does that mean for gold and silver as a flight for quality?
[02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:54.732]  It's going to go up.
[02:31:55.373 --> 02:31:56.354]  So our goal.
[02:31:57.595 --> 02:32:02.460]  As we talk to InfoWars viewers is to get them out of the path of the hurricane.
[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.723]  Get them out of a risk position.
[02:32:05.263 --> 02:32:07.505]  Minimize risk and maximize return.
[02:32:07.846 --> 02:32:09.467]  I'm not saying that things are risk-free.
[02:32:09.928 --> 02:32:10.549]  Nothing in life.
[02:32:10.589 --> 02:32:12.551]  We don't even know if we're going to wake up tomorrow.
[02:32:12.891 --> 02:32:19.418]  But if our goal is to minimize risk, this is how you do it in a world that's in financial upheaval.
[02:32:20.848 --> 02:32:21.609]  Well, it's really a no-brainer.
[02:32:21.629 --> 02:32:23.913]  Look at gold and silver exploding, and it's just everything we've said.
[02:32:23.933 --> 02:32:29.062]  I mean, there's not much in life that's pretty much a sure thing, and I'm not saying this is, because nothing is, but this is ridiculous.
[02:32:29.422 --> 02:32:33.749]  Then you move into the summary of Fed meeting minutes that just took place yesterday.
[02:32:34.690 --> 02:32:38.533]  Yeah, so a lot of people ask me, Alex, and say, Kirk, where do you find your information?
[02:32:38.573 --> 02:32:45.758]  Well, sometimes it's from research, from research publications, or from the manufacturers, or from the Bank for International Settlements, or the Fed.
[02:32:46.158 --> 02:32:50.682]  I don't like to take other people's opinion to make my own opinion.
[02:32:51.142 --> 02:32:52.503]  I like to go to the source.
[02:32:52.563 --> 02:32:54.825]  So here's the source, the Federal Reserve, right?
[02:32:54.885 --> 02:32:59.688]  So they had a meeting on the 21st, so yesterday, right?
[02:32:59.808 --> 02:33:00.949]  So what is their
[02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:03.631]  The minutes from that.
[02:33:03.671 --> 02:33:04.312]  What are the notes?
[02:33:04.352 --> 02:33:05.053]  The bullet points?
[02:33:05.573 --> 02:33:14.821]  Well, a majority of the voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee believe it's appropriate to lower rates at the next meeting.
[02:33:15.782 --> 02:33:18.404]  Well, what happens when they lower rates?
[02:33:18.925 --> 02:33:19.966]  Silver goes up.
[02:33:20.006 --> 02:33:21.067]  We just saw that chart.
[02:33:21.627 --> 02:33:25.029]  So now recent data has enhanced confidence over inflation.
[02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:32.192]  They think they're winning this battle against inflation because some of the their bogus numbers are using their bogus numbers, right?
[02:33:32.252 --> 02:33:44.318]  But but they're saying all these bogus numbers that we're coming out with, we where we modify and we actually redo what we've already reported a month later.
[02:33:44.658 --> 02:33:47.480]  See, this is where, like, the the
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:50.601]  The number of people that are not working, right?
[02:33:50.641 --> 02:33:57.043]  So you look at that, and this is where Kamala's got a huge problem on her hand, right?
[02:33:57.083 --> 02:34:01.145]  Because every single month, when they look at the number of jobless claims, right?
[02:34:01.225 --> 02:34:03.866]  It's like, ooh, more people are working than expected.
[02:34:04.226 --> 02:34:05.907]  This is amazing, right?
[02:34:05.967 --> 02:34:09.608]  And then 30 days later, they revise those numbers.
[02:34:10.188 --> 02:34:11.809]  And what did their revision show?
[02:34:11.829 --> 02:34:13.210]  881,000, almost a million people
[02:34:17.251 --> 02:34:19.474]  Less are working than what they claimed.
[02:34:19.814 --> 02:34:28.545]  So this is where, like, when you make a mistake, Alex, on the air, let's say you say something and it was in error, you go and then you apologize.
[02:34:29.065 --> 02:34:30.787]  Well, what is the stinking media do?
[02:34:31.088 --> 02:34:33.471]  They only look at the first piece and say, ooh.
[02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:36.732]  Alex said a mistake and he's not telling the truth.
[02:34:36.953 --> 02:34:40.574]  They don't cover the fact that you apologized and corrected it, right?
[02:34:40.654 --> 02:34:43.716]  So same thing with the Bureau for Labor Statistics.
[02:34:43.796 --> 02:34:44.896]  Same thing for the government.
[02:34:45.317 --> 02:34:54.421]  They'll give these false inflated numbers and then they'll revise them down the road to the actual more reality and nobody covers those fake numbers, right?
[02:34:54.441 --> 02:34:56.662]  They only cover the first story.
[02:34:57.162 --> 02:34:59.884]  So this is where the economy is stinking bad.
[02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:01.405]  It's really doing that.
[02:35:01.465 --> 02:35:05.667]  There's a million less people working than what they reported.
[02:35:06.087 --> 02:35:09.289]  And so that means less people working, less people spending.
[02:35:09.529 --> 02:35:11.890]  Less people spending, corporate revenues come down.
[02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:14.371]  That means they're going to have to inflate.
[02:35:15.011 --> 02:35:19.614]  They're going to have to inflate their currency because we don't have any demand.
[02:35:20.074 --> 02:35:20.614]  We're good to go.
[02:35:41.042 --> 02:35:52.885]  When you've got a tiny percent of people buying silver and gold, and it's already doing this, and industry buying more, and the elites and central banks and universities and corporations and billionaires hoarding it, what's going to happen when the general public figures this out?
[02:35:52.905 --> 02:35:54.785]  To me, that's going to be the biggest game changer.
[02:35:56.845 --> 02:35:59.746]  It's going to be massive, and it's not going to take much, Alex.
[02:36:00.286 --> 02:36:03.247]  So a lot of people, excuse me, a lot of people
[02:36:04.378 --> 02:36:12.061]  And on our side of the political fence, right, that sometimes they don't trust the government, they don't trust the banks, they don't trust anything.
[02:36:12.902 --> 02:36:17.223]  So they think, everyone's going to be after our gold, they're going to confiscate our gold, right?
[02:36:17.824 --> 02:36:27.468]  I don't think that policymakers care about the gold because, now we do, it's really, to me, it's the only way to actually financial freedom that there is.
[02:36:27.488 --> 02:36:30.189]  But such a small number of people have it anyways, it's not on the radar.
[02:36:30.829 --> 02:36:31.710]  It's not on the radar.
[02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:35.335]  People look at the gold confiscation that went on in the 30s and then later.
[02:36:35.755 --> 02:36:37.958]  That's because everybody had their money in gold and silver.
[02:36:38.258 --> 02:36:40.601]  So they had to make you turn it in for greenbacks, folks.
[02:36:40.621 --> 02:36:41.562]  That doesn't happen now.
[02:36:41.863 --> 02:36:42.323]  Because what?
[02:36:42.764 --> 02:36:43.104]  I mean, what?
[02:36:43.144 --> 02:36:46.729]  Maybe they say like maybe 3% of people hold any substantive silver or gold.
[02:36:46.749 --> 02:36:47.349]  What's the number, Doc?
[02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:55.019]  Well, it's 2% of the population owns gold, 0.9% of the population owns silver.
[02:36:55.519 --> 02:37:06.773]  So if I were a policymaker and I'm going to go on some kind of a confiscatory grab and get people's money because the government's run out of money... You're going to do it like the FDIC did with a haircut with a bailout out of their accounts.
[02:37:07.745 --> 02:37:08.306]  Yeah.
[02:37:08.346 --> 02:37:10.168]  Which they've said they're going to do.
[02:37:10.488 --> 02:37:11.970]  Which they've said they're going to do.
[02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:13.652]  So it's not like that's logical.
[02:37:13.692 --> 02:37:16.014]  We're saying it's logical we're making that prediction.
[02:37:16.275 --> 02:37:18.016]  They said they were going to do it last year.
[02:37:18.477 --> 02:37:19.979]  Should we play the FDIC clip again?
[02:37:21.374 --> 02:37:24.696]  I mean, we certainly can, because it's so appropriate for this.
[02:37:25.256 --> 02:37:26.917]  They're going to go after the masses.
[02:37:26.937 --> 02:37:32.500]  They're going to go after people's bank accounts, their brokerage accounts that 98% of the population has.
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:39.824]  If I were an evil politician, I wouldn't care about something that only 0.9% of the population has.
[02:37:40.344 --> 02:37:43.186]  So, when the masses start to get into this,
[02:37:43.886 --> 02:37:45.788]  If 0.9% owns it, well, so what?
[02:37:45.848 --> 02:37:48.691]  Let's say 1.8% decides to own silver.
[02:37:48.731 --> 02:37:49.631]  That's doubling!
[02:37:49.792 --> 02:37:57.258]  And think how easy it is digitally, as they've said they will, with the global central bank digital currency, ESG, social credit score.
[02:37:57.278 --> 02:37:58.880]  They've said they're going to grab it.
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.022]  So it's digitally perfect.
[02:38:01.162 --> 02:38:01.923]  They can take it.
[02:38:02.323 --> 02:38:03.164]  Not gold and silver.
[02:38:03.224 --> 02:38:04.265]  It's just such a no-brainer.
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:07.602]  Absolutely, it's a no-brainer.
[02:38:08.183 --> 02:38:14.549]  So here's where policy implications come from the reality of the world that we're living in.
[02:38:14.569 --> 02:38:20.956]  I was watching this research, this video, from Art Laffer.
[02:38:21.457 --> 02:38:25.421]  So Art Laffer, he was one of Reagan's chief economists.
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:27.944]  He's a brilliant guy, just absolutely brilliant.
[02:38:28.464 --> 02:38:29.605]  Well, what did he say?
[02:38:29.805 --> 02:38:36.750]  In his exact words, the US dollar is becoming unhinged as a paper currency, right?
[02:38:36.850 --> 02:38:40.112]  It's going to go away in the form that we know it.
[02:38:41.273 --> 02:38:41.854]  And why?
[02:38:42.314 --> 02:38:48.298]  So, he said, what we have in the world over the last 25 years is a period of economic senescence.
[02:38:48.458 --> 02:38:56.464]  So, the world's growth rates have declined dramatically, and since the growth rates have declined, and everybody's wanting all these entitlements,
[02:38:56.744 --> 02:39:02.529]  We have to have stimulus because of pandemics and everything else that are being thrown on us, the economy slowing down.
[02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:12.238]  Governments around the world are printing currency like there's no tomorrow, of which the US government is at the forefront of printing money, right?
[02:39:12.298 --> 02:39:14.660]  Because what we have lost
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:31.289]  So, all of these are signs of an eroding economy, a hyperinflationary scenario that's coming, and he said we're in a period, a new period of collapse for the U.S.
[02:39:31.329 --> 02:39:31.729]  dollar.
[02:39:32.189 --> 02:39:34.810]  Well, we look at this chart that we saw earlier.
[02:39:35.491 --> 02:39:37.432]  What happens when the U.S.
[02:39:37.452 --> 02:39:41.474]  dollar collapses and it's falling off a cliff is tangible assets.
[02:39:41.654 --> 02:39:43.155]  Anything that is tangible.
[02:39:43.795 --> 02:39:53.919]  Whether it's groceries or bicycles or oil or gas or gold or silver, they go up because it takes more of that junk currency to buy valuable goods and services.
[02:39:54.399 --> 02:40:03.883]  So he's telling us, hey, Americans and the rest of the world who's ever listening to this video, forget the fact that the U.S.
[02:40:03.964 --> 02:40:06.064]  dollar has been strong, right?
[02:40:06.084 --> 02:40:08.806]  That it's been the world's reserve currency for the last 80 years.
[02:40:10.006 --> 02:40:18.909]  The page has turned and we need radical, revolutionary economic policies to actually fix this.
[02:40:19.669 --> 02:40:20.609]  Are we going to get that?
[02:40:20.629 --> 02:40:23.450]  I think we can with Trump, right?
[02:40:23.470 --> 02:40:32.073]  He's already got a bunch of policies that he wants to do to try to fix this, like eliminating income tax, putting tariffs on foreign goods to replace that, right?
[02:40:32.113 --> 02:40:33.393]  But what is the
[02:40:35.868 --> 02:40:36.809]  Kamala Harris is
[02:40:52.466 --> 02:40:53.106]  Well, it will.
[02:40:53.286 --> 02:40:54.587]  We're almost out of time.
[02:40:54.627 --> 02:40:55.387]  Explain why they want that.
[02:40:55.407 --> 02:41:01.269]  And then we've got, I already played this in the first hour, the head of the Commerce Department saying she doesn't know what the Bureau of Labor Statistics are.
[02:41:01.709 --> 02:41:04.270]  Trump made it up that they just revised themselves.
[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:08.471]  818,000 fake jobs, one of the biggest fakes in history.
[02:41:08.831 --> 02:41:10.992]  I mean, obviously she is that stupid.
[02:41:11.012 --> 02:41:13.412]  She's just a front person for who's really running things.
[02:41:13.452 --> 02:41:14.953]  But this is reaching cuckoo level.
[02:41:16.633 --> 02:41:18.835]  This is cuckoo level and I saw that interview.
[02:41:18.875 --> 02:41:20.196]  It's like, wait a second.
[02:41:20.336 --> 02:41:24.500]  She's the chairperson of the Department of Commerce, right?
[02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:25.401]  She's in charge of it.
[02:41:26.021 --> 02:41:31.666]  The Department of Labor, the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out with this number and she had never heard of it.
[02:41:31.866 --> 02:41:34.368]  She's the secretary of the Department of Commerce.
[02:41:34.408 --> 02:41:34.829]  I looked it up.
[02:41:35.209 --> 02:41:37.311]  It's the largest division of the Department of Commerce.
[02:41:38.834 --> 02:41:41.236]  Yeah, I mean, it's such a stupid thing to say.
[02:41:41.256 --> 02:41:46.420]  It's like, well, Trump always lies, and so these job reports are not real.
[02:41:46.781 --> 02:41:52.846]  And then the reporter, I can't remember who it was, says, wait a second, this came from the Department of Labor, right?
[02:41:52.866 --> 02:41:54.267]  It's like, I don't know what that is.
[02:41:54.327 --> 02:41:54.967]  I've never heard of it.
[02:41:54.987 --> 02:41:55.568]  It's like, what?
[02:41:56.128 --> 02:41:59.131]  You're the secretary of the Commerce Department, for crying out loud.
[02:41:59.151 --> 02:42:04.055]  That'd be like, because there's four groups in it, and it'd be like not knowing your oldest kid's name when they're 18 years old.
[02:42:05.748 --> 02:42:08.750]  I mean, it's a clown circus running all this stuff, right?
[02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:13.373]  And they simply don't know and understand how the economy works.
[02:42:13.813 --> 02:42:35.488]  So it is going to take a radical economic plan to get us out of $34 trillion worth of debt at the federal level, to get us out of commercial real estate that's collapsing, to get us out of the inflationary pressures before we spiral into Argentina-Venezuelan type inflation.
[02:42:35.988 --> 02:42:49.671]  Right, because these are the choices that they have without a radical change is you rate jack up interest rates to slow down inflation at a time when everyone's consumed with debt and you create the biggest recession that the world has ever known.
[02:42:50.351 --> 02:42:56.693]  Or you don't lower rates because you know if you if you don't lower rates, if you raise rates, people aren't going to spend money.
[02:42:56.733 --> 02:42:59.193]  So you keep them low and then inflation persists.
[02:42:59.713 --> 02:43:02.614]  See, they have two no-win options.
[02:43:03.334 --> 02:43:06.556]  You lower rates and inflation goes through the roof.
[02:43:06.856 --> 02:43:09.157]  You raise rates and you cause a recession.
[02:43:09.758 --> 02:43:11.419]  That's business as usual.
[02:43:11.879 --> 02:43:18.483]  What they need is somebody that's going to think like Trump, fix it by just thinking outside of the box.
[02:43:18.563 --> 02:43:22.045]  And the way that he's thinking about it is not outside of the box.
[02:43:22.805 --> 02:43:25.427]  It's what the Founding Fathers envisioned for our country.
[02:43:25.987 --> 02:43:28.208]  We didn't have income tax back then.
[02:43:28.789 --> 02:43:32.951]  We had tariffs and excise taxes on foreign goods coming into the country.
[02:43:33.472 --> 02:43:35.573]  That will cause people to buy American.
[02:43:35.973 --> 02:43:41.957]  And manufacturing will follow, you know, where people are spending their money.
[02:43:41.977 --> 02:43:44.619]  If people are buying American, the jobs are going to come here.
[02:43:45.319 --> 02:43:55.301]  So, I mean, we have to start thinking differently or else this country is going to sink into an inflationary depression, which is what none of us want.
[02:43:56.541 --> 02:43:57.721]  I totally agree.
[02:43:57.741 --> 02:43:59.442]  People are waking up, though, to the insanity.
[02:43:59.462 --> 02:44:06.583]  Did you see where the CDC and FDA came out in an AP huge working with Harvard study?
[02:44:06.623 --> 02:44:08.303]  And Harvard put this out actually 15 years ago.
[02:44:08.483 --> 02:44:09.204]  That's actually in there.
[02:44:09.844 --> 02:44:11.144]  Massive IQ reduction.
[02:44:12.261 --> 02:44:16.809]  The government reports that fluoride, twice the recommended limit, is linked to lower IQ in kids.
[02:44:16.849 --> 02:44:23.100]  And that's not the actual headline I wanted, but that's one of them, because that's actually what they're putting, is it twice the recommended number.
[02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:24.322]  That is just total...
[02:44:25.299 --> 02:44:27.760]  Incomplete, bonker land craziness.
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:39.123]  In closing, people need to call you at 720-605-3900, 720-605-3900, or KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:44:39.543 --> 02:44:40.583]  Get a consultation.
[02:44:41.163 --> 02:44:43.844]  You're selling it at wholesale price, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:44.204 --> 02:44:46.744]  There's no such thing as spot that's out of the ground, the daily price of gold.
[02:44:46.784 --> 02:44:47.385]  This is wholesale.
[02:44:47.405 --> 02:44:48.425]  It's the lowest price you're going to get.
[02:44:48.805 --> 02:44:49.505]  Gold and silver.
[02:44:49.985 --> 02:44:50.925]  Silver's the thing to get into.
[02:44:50.945 --> 02:44:51.866]  That's a no-brainer right now.
[02:44:51.906 --> 02:44:52.626]  Soon it'll be gold.
[02:44:53.226 --> 02:44:59.588]  Call KEPM or go to KEPM.com forward slash gold, KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[02:45:00.208 --> 02:45:04.370]  It really is one of the smartest moves out there, if not the smartest move.
[02:45:04.810 --> 02:45:10.652]  Relationship with Jesus Christ is number one, and then having yourself together and having friends and family in good positions to get ready for what's happening.
[02:45:10.672 --> 02:45:13.733]  But having silver and gold is the smartest financial thing going on right now, in my view.
[02:45:13.993 --> 02:45:15.353]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, incredible job.
[02:45:15.373 --> 02:45:17.294]  We didn't get to all of it, but we'll have you back soon.
[02:45:17.354 --> 02:45:17.994]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:18.734 --> 02:45:19.155]  Sounds good.
[02:45:19.215 --> 02:45:19.675]  We'll see you.
[02:45:19.835 --> 02:45:20.275]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:21.181 --> 02:45:25.164]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:45:25.184 --> 02:45:27.965]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:45:27.985 --> 02:45:32.208]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:45:32.588 --> 02:45:34.649]  Because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:45:35.170 --> 02:45:39.813]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:45:40.513 --> 02:45:52.068]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:45:52.668 --> 02:45:57.555]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line
[02:45:57.995 --> 02:46:01.438]  from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:46:01.878 --> 02:46:11.026]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled, and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:46:11.347 --> 02:46:12.368]  They're all top of the line.
[02:46:12.388 --> 02:46:13.429]  They're already best sellers.
[02:46:13.729 --> 02:46:17.332]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names.
[02:46:17.572 --> 02:46:19.173]  But they are all the very best.
[02:46:19.654 --> 02:46:21.756]  So this line is called InfoWars MD.
[02:46:22.765 --> 02:46:24.486]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:46:24.866 --> 02:46:28.488]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:46:28.909 --> 02:46:31.470]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:34.872]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:46:35.232 --> 02:46:37.113]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:46:37.133 --> 02:46:38.874]  It's so good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
[02:46:39.235 --> 02:46:41.336]  It is the exact same formula.
[02:46:41.616 --> 02:46:43.156]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[02:46:43.437 --> 02:46:44.637]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[02:46:44.937 --> 02:46:48.338]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[02:46:48.378 --> 02:46:53.379]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:56.160]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:47:02.242]  You want to check out the line of InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:47:02.882 --> 02:47:04.825]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:47:04.945 --> 02:47:06.127]  I need you to take action.
[02:47:06.447 --> 02:47:07.569]  You will love these products.
[02:47:07.809 --> 02:47:09.151]  They work really, really good.
[02:47:09.391 --> 02:47:19.405]  No matter which one you try, they're already top-of-the-line, tested, private-labeled by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[02:47:19.605 --> 02:47:20.386]  Thank you for your support.

[02:47:57.999 --> 02:48:01.421]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.

[02:48:03.863 --> 02:48:05.144]  Superfood greens.

[02:48:06.105 --> 02:48:07.507]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:48:08.027 --> 02:48:10.650]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:48:10.750 --> 02:48:11.751]  Superfood greens.
[02:48:12.191 --> 02:48:13.112]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:48:13.252 --> 02:48:15.675]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:48:15.695 --> 02:48:16.696]  You might not like eating them.
[02:48:16.736 --> 02:48:19.859]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:48:19.879 --> 02:48:21.921]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:48:22.481 --> 02:48:23.401]  And get all the benefits.
[02:48:23.441 --> 02:48:28.263]  Mushroom Maxx, Better Mood Plus, Libido RX, Turmeric 95.
[02:48:28.463 --> 02:48:30.644]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:48:31.024 --> 02:48:35.346]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:48:35.386 --> 02:48:38.787]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[02:48:39.087 --> 02:48:46.050]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:48:47.130 --> 02:48:48.532]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:48.892 --> 02:48:49.692]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:49.732 --> 02:48:50.593]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:48:50.633 --> 02:48:52.555]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:48:52.875 --> 02:48:54.897]  But that's why Tumeric is so important.
[02:48:54.957 --> 02:48:56.218]  Tumeric 95, 25% off.
[02:48:56.438 --> 02:48:58.379]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:48:58.499 --> 02:48:59.680]  The prostate support.
[02:49:00.121 --> 02:49:01.222]  Very important for men.
[02:49:01.742 --> 02:49:02.523]  Nerve Renew.
[02:49:02.743 --> 02:49:03.724]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:49:04.464 --> 02:49:05.485]  Both of those things are key.
[02:49:05.525 --> 02:49:06.626]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:49:06.806 --> 02:49:09.570]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:10.491]  Good night's sleep.
[02:49:10.992 --> 02:49:16.740]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:16.861 --> 02:49:18.142]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:49:18.663 --> 02:49:20.426]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:49:44.428 --> 02:49:45.129]  The Grid.
[02:49:47.829 --> 02:49:51.530]  A digital frontier.
[02:49:53.431 --> 02:49:57.772]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[02:49:58.572 --> 02:49:59.692]  What do they look like?
[02:50:00.273 --> 02:50:00.633]  Ships?
[02:50:00.813 --> 02:50:01.553]  Motorcycles?
[02:50:06.932 --> 02:50:10.780]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[02:50:11.522 --> 02:50:12.464]  And then, one day...
[02:50:38.271 --> 02:50:46.098]  What we saw tonight is the president making a very clear contrast with Donald Trump on all of the issues that matter to the American people.
[02:50:46.158 --> 02:50:54.766]  Truth is, I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world.
[02:50:54.946 --> 02:50:59.267]  That was President Biden's very false claim about no U.S.
[02:50:59.307 --> 02:51:07.409]  troops dying overseas during his time in office, disregarding the 13 service members killed in Afghanistan during the chaotic withdrawal.
[02:51:07.529 --> 02:51:08.510]  Afghanistan, yes.
[02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:10.330]  Were you the last person in the room?
[02:51:10.690 --> 02:51:10.970]  Yes.
[02:51:12.171 --> 02:51:12.951]  And you feel comfortable?
[02:51:13.391 --> 02:51:13.671]  I do.
[02:51:14.011 --> 02:51:20.153]  There was no words to explain how much disrespect we have gotten, how disrespected we feel.
[02:51:20.333 --> 02:51:20.993]  Murder rates went up 30%.
[02:51:21.033 --> 02:51:21.453]  30% they went up.
[02:51:28.013 --> 02:51:30.895]  The biggest increase in history.
[02:51:36.459 --> 02:51:42.504]  Something I'll never get tired of saying, I think all of you, Congresswoman Omar, wonderful doesn't that sound?
[02:51:46.377 --> 02:51:56.026]  When I'm having a tough day or I'm out on about mile five of my run and I'm feeling kind of down and the world's pressing on me I think Ilhan Omar's a congresswoman and it just brightens you up so thank you.
[02:51:57.548 --> 02:52:10.661]  CARE was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.
[02:52:13.459 --> 02:52:23.082]  When I'm having a tough day or I'm out on about mile five of my run and I'm feeling kind of down and the world's pressing on me, I think Ilhan Omar's a congresswoman and it just brightens you up, so thank you.
[02:52:24.242 --> 02:52:32.765]  Hey, remember when Alex Jones got sued for a billion dollars?
[02:52:33.305 --> 02:52:33.585]  More.
[02:52:33.965 --> 02:52:39.927]  And then the people that killed a million people in Iraq didn't face any repercussions?
[02:52:40.167 --> 02:52:40.548]  Crazy.
[02:52:40.748 --> 02:52:41.288]  What a time.
[02:52:42.170 --> 02:52:42.690]  What a time.
[02:52:43.471 --> 02:52:43.711]  Huh?
[02:52:43.731 --> 02:52:44.372]  Isn't that nuts?
[02:52:44.392 --> 02:52:44.872]  Yeah, why?
[02:52:45.132 --> 02:52:46.694]  Isn't that nuts?
[02:52:46.794 --> 02:52:47.474]  What the heck?
[02:52:47.534 --> 02:52:49.115]  What's the real misinformation?
[02:52:49.195 --> 02:52:50.176]  I said, what the heck?
[02:52:50.376 --> 02:52:50.556]  Yeah.
[02:52:51.454 --> 02:53:00.561]  So back in the 1950s, the Chinese developed a slogan, the three red banners, which was for the propagation and building of the socialist state in China.
[02:53:00.581 --> 02:53:06.766]  It stood for the people's commune, the socialist construction and the great leap forward.
[02:53:06.826 --> 02:53:11.730]  Now, if you look around at some things that are going on with Democrats these days, I mean, there's
[02:53:12.671 --> 02:53:20.998]  The DNC, I don't know if you see the three red, oh, anyway, you know, I mean, it goes back a little ways to this guy right here.
[02:53:21.018 --> 02:53:21.919]  That's interesting.
[02:53:22.559 --> 02:53:29.205]  Oh, and then when his successors, which was actually Obama 2.0, when they, oh, wow, three red banners.
[02:53:30.426 --> 02:53:34.169]  And, oh, look, even C-SPAN got in on it.
[02:53:34.809 --> 02:53:35.710]  Interesting stuff.
[02:53:35.970 --> 02:53:37.612]  If you just pay attention, it's right in front of you.
[02:53:45.592 --> 02:53:48.796]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:54:19.086 --> 02:54:24.648]  We're now well into our number four and a great talk show host who co-hosts the show quite often from Australia.
[02:54:24.708 --> 02:54:25.648]  Maria Z is here.
[02:54:25.668 --> 02:54:36.973]  It's her second trip here to the United States and she's been staying here for a few weeks and popping in on the shows and giving us her take from the land down under on what she sees happening here in the United States.
[02:54:37.833 --> 02:54:41.354]  She's got a lot of topics that dovetail with what's happening in America.
[02:54:41.374 --> 02:54:42.855]  We're going to be getting into it because
[02:54:43.695 --> 02:54:47.576]  I cover a lot of stuff happening in Australia, or Europe, or Africa, or China, or Latin America.
[02:54:47.596 --> 02:54:48.457]  People say, why do we care?
[02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:49.857]  There's this built-in thing.
[02:54:50.397 --> 02:54:55.459]  Americans, for any industrialized country, have the lowest level of actually holding a passport.
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:57.260]  So Americans are great.
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:57.940]  I'm an American.
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:01.782]  But at the same time, people don't understand, the planet's not that big.
[02:55:01.802 --> 02:55:02.222]  You can fly
[02:55:02.782 --> 02:55:06.284]  You know, around the world in just 30-something hours.
[02:55:06.324 --> 02:55:08.185]  You can go to Australia in 18 hours.
[02:55:08.206 --> 02:55:10.207]  You can go to Hawaii in 9 hours.
[02:55:10.247 --> 02:55:14.169]  You can go to, you know, Japan in 18 hours or less if you fly over the North Pole or around it.
[02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:23.976]  So, the globalists are literally cutting off the resources, destroying the West, destabilizing everything to bring in their corporate rule.
[02:55:24.856 --> 02:55:34.480]  So, Z-Media, Z-E-E-Media.com, she's here with us, great talk show host, journalist, and analyst, and great reportage for us during the lockdowns over there.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:41.603]  Canada and Australia, as well as places like Italy, are really the main testing grounds of the tyranny, just like the UK.
[02:55:42.063 --> 02:55:46.305]  So whatever you see happening there is just a few years away from us here.
[02:55:46.325 --> 02:55:48.546]  Arresting people for non-violent free speech,
[02:55:49.386 --> 02:55:49.986]  I think?
[02:56:20.086 --> 02:56:24.467]  In children from the toxic form of fluoride they put in the water.
[02:56:24.987 --> 02:56:25.808]  What do you make of that?
[02:56:25.928 --> 02:56:32.069]  And why do you think they're suddenly now admitting what's been known science for over a hundred years until the 50s?
[02:56:32.089 --> 02:56:35.430]  They use fluoride as rat and roach poison.
[02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:37.230]  They just get it on their feet and lick it off.
[02:56:37.270 --> 02:56:37.990]  They die.
[02:56:38.290 --> 02:56:47.753]  They put something even worse than sodium fluoride, the acid form of it, hydrofluorosilic acid in the water at the level that causes the brain damage, infertility, and cancer.
[02:56:47.773 --> 02:56:48.793]  Maria Z, what do you make of that?
[02:56:49.213 --> 02:56:51.294]  Well, Alex, I think there are a couple of decades too late.
[02:56:51.314 --> 02:57:05.303]  They should have been listening to you when you were warning the world about this at the time that Alex was screaming from the rooftops trying to warn people that they are trying to poison us through our water, lower our IQ through the water.
[02:57:05.823 --> 02:57:09.786]  And I think it's really interesting that they're coming out at this time with it at a time where
[02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:12.168]  Federal agencies are losing public trust.
[02:57:12.268 --> 02:57:13.649]  The media is losing public trust.
[02:57:13.689 --> 02:57:25.019]  And so what we're seeing are these little snippets into truth from some of these health agencies or federal agencies, even CNN pushing back a little bit on Kamala right now, trying to gain the public trust.
[02:57:25.039 --> 02:57:27.862]  Because truly, Alex, I think it's because we're going to have
[02:57:28.302 --> 02:57:29.343]  We're good to go.
[02:57:52.552 --> 02:57:58.756]  I use the serial killer analogy because I've watched documentaries about it and read quite a few books on it because it's interesting criminology.
[02:57:59.277 --> 02:58:21.132]  The low-level psychopath, like a, you know, Bundy, Ted Bundy, he would wear a suit and tie, drive a non-threatening yellow Volkswagen, go to malls, and pick up teenage and, you know, 20-year-old women, and he would invite them to take him out for coffee or take him out for dinner, and then he would point a gun at them in the car and say, put these handcuffs on or I'm going to shoot you.
[02:58:21.792 --> 02:58:22.133]  I think so.
[02:58:39.896 --> 02:58:48.463]  Or not being able to leave your house, and the pressure of that, and, oh, we'll lock you up, COVID tracking, tracers with fake PCR tests, you were near somebody that had it.
[02:58:48.843 --> 02:58:54.327]  That's their excuse to get you in the handcuffs and get you to the farmhouse and get you in the basement.
[02:58:54.708 --> 02:59:01.673]  And so the world was putting on the handcuffs for a while, but finally a woman struggled free and jumped out of the car and got away.
[02:59:02.053 --> 02:59:04.355]  And that finally got him busted, but then he escaped.
[02:59:04.736 --> 02:59:06.797]  And then he got busted again and caught and finally executed.
[02:59:08.058 --> 02:59:14.520]  I use that analogy because the globalists are psychopaths that are operating at a much more sophisticated level.
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:20.461]  We have to understand that every degree of freedom we give up does not give us security, but it puts us deeper into a straitjacket.
[02:59:20.761 --> 02:59:27.323]  And they want to torture us in the basement, but instead they want to torture us slowly with these nanoparticles, self-replicating poisons in our body.
[02:59:27.623 --> 02:59:34.245]  And once you realize that Bill Gates is the greatest serial killer living, the greatest rapist ever, and see him for what he is, then it all makes sense.
[02:59:34.841 --> 02:59:49.502]  Yeah you're absolutely right and they gave us this, they lulled us, well not us, but they lulled most of the population into a false sense of security when they loosened the chains a little bit after COVID and we said that this would happen and we warned the people do not
[02:59:50.463 --> 02:59:50.944]  Relax.
[02:59:51.204 --> 02:59:54.186]  Don't relax just because you're allowed to go outside again.
[02:59:54.206 --> 03:00:02.271]  You know, you bring that up, Alex, and I don't want to constantly rehash what they did during COVID, but the testing ground of Australia is very important.
[03:00:03.072 --> 03:00:07.735]  A 3.1 approximately mile radius around your home that you can go for food and if that
[03:00:08.135 --> 03:00:10.437]  Food happens to be out of that 3.1 miles.
[03:00:10.477 --> 03:00:10.838]  Too bad.
[03:00:10.878 --> 03:00:11.318]  So sad.
[03:00:11.378 --> 03:00:12.499]  You can't go buy food.
[03:00:12.579 --> 03:00:16.402]  I mean, this was a reality for many, many Australians.
[03:00:16.442 --> 03:00:19.545]  And you think they wouldn't have done that in America if they didn't have the chance?
[03:00:19.585 --> 03:00:27.152]  And as far as the preparation for the next phase, you've been speaking a lot, Alex, about the camps that they built and about the fact that
[03:00:27.392 --> 03:00:33.456]  You know, you've got Peter Hotez calling for NATO and the Department of Homeland Security to fight anti-vax aggression.
[03:00:33.716 --> 03:00:36.378]  Think about how dangerous and serious these statements are.
[03:00:36.398 --> 03:00:44.084]  You had Jacinda Ardern at the UN talking about the fact that we are at war with the people that disagree with us, the people inside our nations.
[03:00:44.104 --> 03:00:46.986]  We have Eric Schmidt of Google saying use NATO on us.
[03:00:47.446 --> 03:00:47.626]  Yeah.
[03:00:47.886 --> 03:00:48.967]  This is a real talking point.
[03:00:48.987 --> 03:00:50.388]  This is a real talking point.
[03:00:50.428 --> 03:00:58.154]  These people are revisiting now, starting to revisit the topics, the statements that they made during COVID, which were much more aggressive.
[03:00:58.214 --> 03:01:02.097]  She's now the global information czar of the WF and was at the DNC.
[03:01:03.138 --> 03:01:15.429]  And at that speech at the United Nations that she gave, every single person in that room, or at least most of them, stood up and gave her a standing ovation when she declared war on people like us who disagree with the globalists.
[03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:16.910]  That is what these people think of you.
[03:01:17.271 --> 03:01:20.473]  They absolutely feel that they are at war with you.
[03:01:20.533 --> 03:01:22.455]  And what happens when you're at war with your enemy?
[03:01:22.475 --> 03:01:23.176]  You want them dead.
[03:01:23.656 --> 03:01:26.338]  You want them dead and that is exactly what they are trying to do.
[03:01:26.658 --> 03:01:28.059]  That is what they're trying to do here.
[03:01:28.119 --> 03:01:40.848]  Now this admission about the fluoride in Australia, Alex mentioned this, they just discovered forever chemicals in water samples across Sydney and mind you they found them in June but it's taken them two months to tell people about it massively in articles.
[03:01:41.088 --> 03:01:42.449]  What have you been doing for two months?
[03:01:42.589 --> 03:01:53.216]  Apparently you can test the the water samples and find COVID every single day in the sewerage systems but it takes you two months to tell people that there's forever chemicals found in water that are going to give you cancer.
[03:01:54.356 --> 03:01:58.578]  And again, they just point a PCR test at a sewer line, an open sewer.
[03:01:58.938 --> 03:02:08.481]  They turn it up 30, 40 times where, you know, if you have a metal detector, and this is what the inventor said, and you aim it in the sky and turn it up on high, set for gold, it will find gold in the sky.
[03:02:08.521 --> 03:02:08.981]  It's not there.
[03:02:09.282 --> 03:02:10.062]  It will find silver.
[03:02:10.082 --> 03:02:11.722]  It will find anything you want.
[03:02:11.762 --> 03:02:12.683]  It will find iron.
[03:02:13.343 --> 03:02:14.023]  And it's the same thing.
[03:02:14.043 --> 03:02:18.725]  They just turn the PCR test up until it goes bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, and that's their excuse to disappear you.
[03:02:19.807 --> 03:02:21.848]  And that's exactly what they're doing now with mpox.
[03:02:22.148 --> 03:02:24.889]  I don't believe this narrative coming out of Africa at all.
[03:02:24.949 --> 03:02:27.490]  In fact, there are people in Africa saying this is not the case.
[03:02:27.530 --> 03:02:28.691]  There is no pandemic here.
[03:02:28.731 --> 03:02:36.614]  We have time after time after time, Alex adequately referred to Bill Gates as the world's biggest serial killer.
[03:02:36.634 --> 03:02:37.774]  He's absolutely right about that.
[03:02:38.074 --> 03:02:41.236]  How many times have they run eugenics programs in Africa?
[03:02:41.276 --> 03:02:43.237]  How many women have they made infertile?
[03:02:43.297 --> 03:02:43.877]  And mind you,
[03:02:44.577 --> 03:02:51.160]  If you watch that movie, it's up on the other videos section of zmedia.com specifically about infertility in Africa.
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:56.382]  They are actually warning in that movie, please, please don't let them do to you what they did to us.
[03:02:56.422 --> 03:02:57.402]  They're talking to the West.
[03:02:57.742 --> 03:02:59.703]  And this is exactly the message of everyone else.
[03:03:00.744 --> 03:03:02.044]  And now the infertility is here.
[03:03:02.124 --> 03:03:06.486]  I mean, since the shots in the last three and a half years, infertility has exploded.
[03:03:08.192 --> 03:03:10.192]  Yes, and so this is my point.
[03:03:10.593 --> 03:03:19.614]  When I'm coming from a country like Australia or Canadians or the UK that are saying things have accelerated beyond any semblance of normality.
[03:03:19.654 --> 03:03:21.675]  This is beyond control.
[03:03:21.955 --> 03:03:25.416]  These people have, you know, they've gone mad.
[03:03:25.496 --> 03:03:26.276]  They've gone mad.
[03:03:26.336 --> 03:03:31.897]  They're releasing 5,000 dangerous criminals to put people in prison for their speech in the UK.
[03:03:32.757 --> 03:03:35.218]  And we've seen shadows of this in the US, Alex.
[03:03:35.258 --> 03:03:37.499]  We've seen the way that they come after people.
[03:03:37.559 --> 03:03:40.961]  Owen Troyer, for goodness sake, was put in prison for his speech.
[03:03:41.021 --> 03:03:42.061]  This is America.
[03:03:42.441 --> 03:03:47.323]  So, I mean, for me, I see America as the last stand for the West.
[03:03:47.744 --> 03:03:49.224]  Really, I truly do.
[03:03:49.284 --> 03:03:50.425]  This next election is...
[03:03:51.546 --> 03:04:00.933]  It's kind of cliche, the most important election of our lifetime, but it actually is because the countries like Australia are very, very, very quickly slipping.
[03:04:00.953 --> 03:04:02.995]  Now, I'm not saying all hope is lost for Australia.
[03:04:03.015 --> 03:04:11.141]  In fact, the reason I'm here is because I believe that Australia can be saved, just like I believe the UK and Canada and certainly the US can be saved.
[03:04:12.282 --> 03:04:20.744]  I think it's through this next election, specifically if Trump gets elected, that we will start to see some normality in the rest of the countries.
[03:04:20.844 --> 03:04:21.744]  I really do think that.
[03:04:22.384 --> 03:04:31.847]  Pulling back from things, what are the differences you see in your trips to the US versus trips around the world or back in Australia?
[03:04:31.867 --> 03:04:36.948]  Because I just read the news and listen to you and others, but it appears to me that Australia
[03:04:37.668 --> 03:04:39.809]  I mean, the Global Summit is a major testing ground.
[03:04:39.849 --> 03:04:41.429]  Why do you think Australia's been chosen?
[03:04:41.449 --> 03:04:47.531]  I know there's been major pushback, but now your leaders are just like, oh, we're going to arrest you if you make fun of us.
[03:04:47.871 --> 03:04:49.131]  They're going full totalitarian.
[03:04:49.151 --> 03:05:02.355]  And for people that haven't been tuned in or missed it, we played clips a few weeks ago, and I've got more clips I haven't gotten to, where these magistrates, these judges go, you wrote that the migrants are engaged in a higher proportion of rape.
[03:05:02.655 --> 03:05:03.135]  22 months.
[03:05:03.195 --> 03:05:05.035]  How dare you?
[03:05:05.416 --> 03:05:06.476]  And a giant fine.
[03:05:07.416 --> 03:05:09.597]  Upwards of 80% of the rapes are the illegal aliens.
[03:05:09.697 --> 03:05:09.837]  Yes.
[03:05:09.917 --> 03:05:13.259]  I mean, even if the guy wasn't right, he should be able to say it, but it's true!
[03:05:13.559 --> 03:05:14.219]  Yes, yes.
[03:05:15.060 --> 03:05:15.940]  But that's the point, Alex.
[03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:20.742]  Even if he wasn't right, he should be able to say it, because that is what happens with the mainstream media.
[03:05:20.782 --> 03:05:26.225]  They are constantly publishing actual misinformation, and I hate that word, because they've weaponized it against us.
[03:05:26.585 --> 03:05:27.285]  It's lies.
[03:05:27.305 --> 03:05:28.986]  It is lies.
[03:05:29.106 --> 03:05:34.789]  And this is, by the way, the speech laws in Australia, because we don't have a Bill of Rights.
[03:05:35.629 --> 03:05:38.471]  They are now saying that they want to shut down independent media.
[03:05:39.012 --> 03:05:40.913]  All people are going to be subjected.
[03:05:40.953 --> 03:05:47.318]  This is a misinformation bill that they introduced last year, pulled back on because of the concerns about religious freedoms.
[03:05:47.638 --> 03:05:50.440]  But in this bill, it basically, it actually, actually
[03:05:50.520 --> 03:06:01.723]  He specifically, expressly says that everyone will be held to the same standard, which is whatever the government deems to be misinformation, you will get investigated, you will potentially get your property seized, your documents seized.
[03:06:02.063 --> 03:06:07.085]  People like me could be arrested and investigated for publishing, you know, the truth.
[03:06:07.865 --> 03:06:12.290]  But it expressly states that mainstream media will not be held to those standards.
[03:06:12.330 --> 03:06:13.231]  What does that tell you?
[03:06:13.691 --> 03:06:23.241]  And the government just spent millions of dollars bailing out a Paramount-owned mainstream media mouthpiece network.
[03:06:24.304 --> 03:06:24.924]  That is
[03:06:54.244 --> 03:06:54.384]  That's
[03:07:13.643 --> 03:07:14.764]  We're good to go.
[03:07:29.611 --> 03:07:43.494]  The main differences that I'm noticing is that, for example, just now with what was happening in the UK, and yes, you're right, they announced they want to extradite people and charge them for their opinions in other countries, and this really is a shadow of the global government.
[03:07:43.514 --> 03:07:49.996]  It doesn't matter where you are in the world, Big Brother's watching and ready to snap at you for having wrong think.
[03:07:50.096 --> 03:07:51.536]  They're testing martial law.
[03:07:51.556 --> 03:07:53.337]  This was all a dress rehearsal for full martial law.
[03:07:53.357 --> 03:07:53.457]  Yes.
[03:07:53.757 --> 03:07:54.697]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:07:54.818 --> 03:07:59.200]  And I think a lot of it was stoking to reach to the point of civil unrest.
[03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:02.161]  A lot of it was stoking the messaging in the media.
[03:08:02.201 --> 03:08:05.422]  You look at the way that they're dividing people in the media constantly.
[03:08:05.703 --> 03:08:09.244]  You know, we call a spade a spade and it's not for the purpose of division.
[03:08:09.284 --> 03:08:12.266]  It's for the purpose of cutting through their tactics.
[03:08:12.326 --> 03:08:17.368]  But they are in every country, Australia now, raising our terrorism threat immediately.
[03:08:17.728 --> 03:08:20.210]  Immediately after what was happening in the UK.
[03:08:20.591 --> 03:08:31.981]  And by the way, Alex, also publishing articles about how conspiracy theorists are the problem, anti-vaxxers are the problem, equating us to cop killers... Oh, the current British Prime Minister says...
[03:08:32.898 --> 03:08:36.802]  We need to arrest people that question the public health authority.
[03:08:36.922 --> 03:08:37.843]  It's not just Hotez.
[03:08:37.883 --> 03:08:38.723]  They're all saying it.
[03:08:39.044 --> 03:08:39.304]  Yes.
[03:08:39.724 --> 03:08:39.925]  Yes.
[03:08:39.985 --> 03:08:48.873]  And the WHO some time ago, in conjunction with Peter Hotez, was saying that people who are anti-vax or anti-science are terrorists.
[03:08:48.913 --> 03:08:50.494]  They equate us to terrorists.
[03:08:50.915 --> 03:08:52.957]  So it's very... Albert Bourla did.
[03:08:53.537 --> 03:09:01.083]  It's so important to understand that they are treating us like we are a genuine threat, like we need to be eliminated.
[03:09:01.103 --> 03:09:03.846]  But meanwhile, everything they say about us getting people killed, is it true?
[03:09:03.866 --> 03:09:04.907]  Everything they said is a lie.
[03:09:04.927 --> 03:09:05.547]  You're good at this.
[03:09:05.567 --> 03:09:09.070]  Why don't you talk about everything we were told about COVID was a lie?
[03:09:09.070 --> 03:09:11.452]  Everything about the shots, everything about the treatment.
[03:09:11.512 --> 03:09:12.953]  I mean, everything.
[03:09:14.054 --> 03:09:14.715]  Everything, Alex.
[03:09:14.755 --> 03:09:16.456]  And this is, you know, so important.
[03:09:16.516 --> 03:09:19.419]  Just this week, this happened.
[03:09:19.479 --> 03:09:25.804]  So in Australia, they were trying to establish a commission, a COVID-19 commission of inquiry.
[03:09:26.364 --> 03:09:32.990]  And according to Senator Ralph Babbitt, who I've had on the broadcast with me, 10 yeses, 26 noes.
[03:09:33.070 --> 03:09:36.113]  So 26 people inside our parliament did not want
[03:09:36.693 --> 03:09:45.181]  To look at COVID and see what went wrong and the basic stuff like we know that the lockdowns were tremendously bad for children.
[03:09:45.481 --> 03:09:53.949]  We know that civil liberties were trashed, businesses were destroyed, children's education was ruined, sports were banned, people died alone, lives were lost, families were broken up.
[03:09:54.529 --> 03:10:01.591]  And this is, I'm just reading Senator Babbitt's tweet, and he says Australians deserve to know the truth about what went on behind closed doors.
[03:10:02.051 --> 03:10:03.651]  None of their decisions made any sense.
[03:10:03.731 --> 03:10:10.133]  Even Fauci himself admits that the social distancing rule he just plucked out of nowhere, really, it was not scientific.
[03:10:10.533 --> 03:10:18.714]  Meanwhile, they were telling us, trust the science, we're the science, we're going to be your single source of truth, like Jacinda, Jabsinda Ardern, the tyrant from New Zealand.
[03:10:18.754 --> 03:10:20.435]  We're going to be your single source of truth.
[03:10:21.135 --> 03:10:28.121]  This statement, by the way, was repeated by the New South Wales Police when we had a recent stabbing in Australia at Westfields.
[03:10:28.801 --> 03:10:32.444]  And they said, you know, stop spreading the social media stuff.
[03:10:32.484 --> 03:10:34.786]  We're going to be your single source of truth.
[03:10:34.906 --> 03:10:38.909]  I am so sick and tired of being told who I need to get my information.
[03:10:38.929 --> 03:10:41.571]  Well, you're in a cult when you're being told don't listen to anyone.
[03:10:41.591 --> 03:10:42.853]  In fact, guys, get the clip of her.
[03:10:42.893 --> 03:10:44.134]  And that may be it, but that's a side shot.
[03:10:44.154 --> 03:10:46.555]  There's a front on shot of her at press conferences saying.
[03:10:47.276 --> 03:10:48.337]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[03:10:48.377 --> 03:10:49.558]  Don't look at the sunsets.
[03:10:50.059 --> 03:10:50.499]  Literally.
[03:10:50.859 --> 03:10:52.120]  They'll say the same thing in Australia.
[03:10:52.881 --> 03:10:54.943]  And we are your single source of truth.
[03:10:55.423 --> 03:10:56.324]  That's what Fauci said.
[03:10:56.344 --> 03:10:57.865]  He said, I am the science.
[03:10:57.905 --> 03:10:59.186]  Well, science is questioning.
[03:10:59.627 --> 03:10:59.847]  Yes.
[03:11:00.107 --> 03:11:01.108]  I mean, that's a cult, folks.
[03:11:01.128 --> 03:11:04.271]  When you're told don't question and two men can have a baby, that's a cult.
[03:11:04.711 --> 03:11:05.372]  It is a cult.
[03:11:05.752 --> 03:11:08.153]  But, you know, we say it's a cult.
[03:11:08.394 --> 03:11:10.655]  But these people are actually part of a cult, Alex.
[03:11:10.695 --> 03:11:12.036]  These people are satanic.
[03:11:12.096 --> 03:11:12.877]  They are evil.
[03:11:13.177 --> 03:11:16.499]  And those that are following them, whether they know it or not, are under their spell.
[03:11:16.539 --> 03:11:18.600]  This is absolutely a spiritual battle.
[03:11:18.921 --> 03:11:20.862]  And this is why the lies were so prevalent.
[03:11:20.882 --> 03:11:28.187]  But I will never forget the orchestration, Alex, the worldwide lockstep media response.
[03:11:28.947 --> 03:11:29.948]  I'm in the media.
[03:11:30.028 --> 03:11:31.649]  So it astounds me constantly.
[03:11:31.669 --> 03:11:34.371]  And again, I don't want to constantly relive this, but we cannot
[03:11:34.891 --> 03:11:47.721]  Well, they're trying to now with monkeypox and bird flu and their global emergency and their global UN treaty, it says in Operation Lockstep and in other BAMF Canada documents, 2006, that they were going to use disease X for world government.
[03:11:47.761 --> 03:12:00.331]  This is the, they think the disease scare has always been their secret weapon and they launched it, had devastating effect both psychologically on the economy and killing people with the poison shots, but it's backfired now in my view.
[03:12:01.195 --> 03:12:01.815]  It's interesting.
[03:12:02.556 --> 03:12:05.177]  I did an interview with Karen Kingston some time ago.
[03:12:05.217 --> 03:12:07.699]  She was a former Pfizer employee and a biotech analyst.
[03:12:08.079 --> 03:12:19.225]  And she actually showed me from the NIH themselves that they know that health scares are the most, even more effective than economic scares, the most effective for controlling populations.
[03:12:19.265 --> 03:12:21.306]  So that is why they keep going with the health scare.
[03:12:21.346 --> 03:12:23.467]  And I mean, look how successful they were last time, Alex.
[03:12:23.747 --> 03:12:28.570]  They successfully terrified the pants of world populations.
[03:12:28.610 --> 03:12:29.631]  But again, just that
[03:12:30.111 --> 03:12:34.394]  Synchronized, same messaging during COVID.
[03:12:34.794 --> 03:12:35.515]  And it was global.
[03:12:35.535 --> 03:12:36.515]  Look at Jacinda Ardern.
[03:12:36.875 --> 03:12:37.776]  Beautiful young woman.
[03:12:38.296 --> 03:12:38.997]  She's still young.
[03:12:39.157 --> 03:12:40.058]  Looks like a zombie.
[03:12:40.398 --> 03:12:41.839]  Even on camera she looks anorexic.
[03:12:42.339 --> 03:12:44.801]  And the stuff she says, if a person came to my door...
[03:12:45.541 --> 03:12:47.342]  Looking and acting like her, I wouldn't open it.
[03:12:47.462 --> 03:12:50.163]  I mean, she looks like, and when you talk about being a cult, define that.
[03:12:50.183 --> 03:12:52.203]  We'll go to break, come back into more of this, but we'll play this.
[03:12:52.223 --> 03:13:02.247]  First, we're going to play that Simpsons piece that messed up the other day, for some reason, the computer, from like 15 years ago about the healthcare, the cat flu.
[03:13:02.907 --> 03:13:06.789]  And then I want to go into Jacinda Arden's, where the single source of information, but we're a few minutes to break.
[03:13:07.569 --> 03:13:12.452]  This is a global WUF transhumanist death cult in their own words.
[03:13:12.492 --> 03:13:13.793]  When you say that, you're not just saying it.
[03:13:14.013 --> 03:13:17.555]  From your deep research, how would you in a few minutes quantify what this cult is?
[03:13:19.864 --> 03:13:32.756]  It's a mix, Alex, between people that actually are in a satanic religion and those that have adopted the religion of scientism, which actually is serving the top religion of satanism.
[03:13:33.257 --> 03:13:38.001]  And so those that are serving the religion of scientism are thinking that we...
[03:13:39.282 --> 03:13:49.251]  They think that by thinking rationally and logically, which of course it's not rational or logical at all to try and become a cyborg or to believe that a man can be a woman.
[03:13:49.311 --> 03:14:01.022]  I mean, I don't need to tell you all of the ridiculous things that these people believe, but they actually think that this rationalism is some sort of an elevated way of thinking or they are, you know, truly elite
[03:14:01.482 --> 03:14:01.962]  I don't know.
[03:14:20.755 --> 03:14:29.484]  It's all blending into one, Alex, but these people don't realize that ultimately it's being driven by the religion at the top, which is ultimately Satanism.
[03:14:29.804 --> 03:14:31.046]  And so it's just funneling.
[03:14:31.126 --> 03:14:33.568]  All these ideas keep funneling through, funneling through.
[03:14:34.616 --> 03:14:37.437]  But at its core is do as thou wilt.
[03:14:38.218 --> 03:14:38.818]  Do as thou wilt.
[03:14:38.858 --> 03:14:40.479]  Try and live as long as you can.
[03:14:40.559 --> 03:14:41.499]  Be your own god.
[03:14:41.539 --> 03:14:43.260]  Don't worry about society.
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:44.280]  Don't worry about the laws.
[03:14:44.300 --> 03:14:45.441]  We're going to rewrite the laws.
[03:14:45.481 --> 03:14:47.242]  We're going to rewrite society.
[03:14:47.262 --> 03:14:56.265]  We're going to build this utopia which is actually just a nightmare dystopia where there is no free thought, no free movement, no free anything.
[03:14:56.306 --> 03:14:57.106]  There is no freedom.
[03:14:57.126 --> 03:15:01.948]  In fact, the more that they tell you we're giving you freedom, the less freedom they're actually giving you.
[03:15:02.108 --> 03:15:09.673]  They promise to empower the individual, the final end of individualism, but then it wrecks and destroys all individualism and is a hive borg that takes your free will.
[03:15:09.794 --> 03:15:10.094]  Correct.
[03:15:10.134 --> 03:15:11.154]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:15:11.235 --> 03:15:12.495]  And that is the ultimate goal.
[03:15:12.836 --> 03:15:20.281]  The AI World Society, the UN's AI World Society, where you essentially transition into living in this mixed reality.
[03:15:20.681 --> 03:15:30.128]  The metaverse becomes part of your life and part of your reality to the point where you can no longer distinguish what is real through what is false.
[03:15:30.188 --> 03:15:31.189]  And I actually believe
[03:15:31.869 --> 03:15:36.431]  That a lot of the false news that comes out there is also launched by them to confuse us.
[03:15:36.531 --> 03:15:37.051]  Oh, that's right.
[03:15:37.071 --> 03:15:37.672]  Well, they admit they do.
[03:15:37.732 --> 03:15:44.415]  And the high priest of this was Arthur C. Clarke, the inventor of the communications satellite and a pedo and a lot of other stuff on record.
[03:15:44.775 --> 03:15:46.696]  But he wrote Childhood's End as a metaphor.
[03:15:47.016 --> 03:15:50.778]  The plan is to get us to believe AI is real and then lived about age 10.
[03:15:50.818 --> 03:15:52.218]  Then they kill us, download our brain.
[03:15:52.258 --> 03:15:53.279]  It's not really us anymore.
[03:15:53.559 --> 03:15:55.060]  And then it's just this AI system.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:01.683]  So the plan is to finally mix it, the metaverse, and finally then kill people, saying carbon's bad, you've got to become silicon.
[03:16:01.963 --> 03:16:06.446]  Well, they have suicide pods now in Sweden, so, you know, pushing that, pushing the suicide pods.
[03:16:07.466 --> 03:16:09.047]  Yeah, kill yourself, it's great.
[03:16:09.127 --> 03:16:10.588]  Let's go for a walk with Satan.
[03:16:12.089 --> 03:16:13.509]  Suicide's fantastic.
[03:16:13.549 --> 03:16:16.031]  It's great for, I don't know, climate change, I guess.
[03:16:16.653 --> 03:16:18.535]  Maria Z, Z Media from Australia.
[03:16:18.575 --> 03:16:19.035]  Stay there.
[03:16:19.055 --> 03:16:20.436]  We've got a lot to cover.
[03:16:20.736 --> 03:16:24.940]  We'll play those clips I talked about, that Simpsons piece from 15 years ago, throw in your face.
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:29.103]  And then Jacinda Arden, who's now the WUF head of controlling disinformation.
[03:16:29.123 --> 03:16:30.544]  That means blocking the truth.
[03:16:30.824 --> 03:16:31.825]  How's it going, Harrison?
[03:16:31.885 --> 03:16:33.246]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:16:33.266 --> 03:16:34.667]  You guys have the best crew.
[03:16:34.987 --> 03:16:36.168]  You guys are awesome.
[03:16:36.248 --> 03:16:37.650]  Just wanted to plug real quick.
[03:16:37.810 --> 03:16:41.973]  Just recently found out after 14 years, I got a quarter or half
[03:16:42.173 --> 03:16:45.474]  My muscle torn off from my shoulder blade, right?
[03:16:45.494 --> 03:16:53.156]  So I've been in constant pain for years and the turmeric, the nitric boost, the fish oil, everything.
[03:16:53.276 --> 03:16:57.137]  If I don't take it, dude, I'm totally feeling it and I'm on the floor.
[03:16:57.157 --> 03:17:01.298]  This is one of the only things is your products that gets me going.
[03:17:01.438 --> 03:17:06.680]  If it's helping me and I've been in pain for 14 years, you guys gotta try some of it.
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:07.240]  Wow.
[03:17:07.561 --> 03:17:08.301]  It's true, folks.
[03:17:08.381 --> 03:17:10.243]  You hear people call in like this all the time.
[03:17:10.703 --> 03:17:16.949]  These products are life-changing if you take them as directed, especially combined with exercise and a good diet.
[03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:21.393]  Things like BODYZ, the turmeric supplement, Turmeric 95 from InfoWarsMD.
[03:17:21.853 --> 03:17:25.476]  Incredibly powerful, life-changing stuff at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:25.496 --> 03:17:26.137]  Thanks for the call, Drew.
[03:17:33.250 --> 03:17:36.851]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[03:17:37.311 --> 03:17:45.394]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[03:17:45.834 --> 03:17:49.415]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[03:17:50.815 --> 03:17:52.736]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
[03:17:52.976 --> 03:17:53.136]  Yeah.
[03:17:54.549 --> 03:17:55.189]  A new disease.
[03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:56.069]  No one's immune.
[03:17:56.390 --> 03:17:59.650]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[03:17:59.830 --> 03:18:01.531]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[03:18:02.211 --> 03:18:06.412]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[03:18:06.432 --> 03:18:07.993]  He loves being that guy.
[03:18:08.073 --> 03:18:10.513]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[03:18:10.733 --> 03:18:12.434]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[03:18:12.694 --> 03:18:17.015]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[03:18:17.215 --> 03:18:20.636]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[03:18:20.956 --> 03:18:21.696]  Get over here, NBC.
[03:18:24.037 --> 03:18:27.358]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[03:18:29.918 --> 03:18:30.178]  Wow.
[03:18:30.878 --> 03:18:31.138]  Wow.
[03:18:31.658 --> 03:18:32.319]  Oh, yeah.
[03:18:32.359 --> 03:18:34.059]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[03:18:34.479 --> 03:18:38.740]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.340]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:44.021]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[03:18:44.221 --> 03:18:51.602]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[03:18:53.379 --> 03:18:59.023]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender vittles.
[03:19:05.447 --> 03:19:10.090]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[03:19:10.371 --> 03:19:13.393]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[03:19:14.153 --> 03:19:17.976]  You know, I don't know when this was ever a good idea.
[03:19:27.148 --> 03:19:27.890]  Hurry up, boy!
[03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:32.600]  We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid!
[03:19:37.588 --> 03:19:46.877]  I've been watching for some days, and this is not unique to New Zealand, that in the midst of what is a global issue, as you would expect, there are a number of rumours that circulate.
[03:19:47.718 --> 03:19:50.541]  I am present on social media, I see it myself.
[03:19:51.321 --> 03:19:58.728]  I cannot go around and individually dismiss every single rumour I see on social media, as tempted as I might be.
[03:19:59.329 --> 03:20:02.331]  So instead I want to send a clear message to the New Zealand public.
[03:20:03.232 --> 03:20:07.234]  We will share with you the most up-to-date information daily.
[03:20:07.714 --> 03:20:10.356]  You can trust us as a source of that information.
[03:20:11.116 --> 03:20:15.038]  You can also trust the Director-General of Health and the Ministry of Health.
[03:20:15.618 --> 03:20:20.961]  For that information, do feel free to visit at any time to clarify any rumour you may hear.
[03:20:20.981 --> 03:20:23.062]  Otherwise, dismiss anything else.
[03:20:28.104 --> 03:20:30.546]  We will continue to be your single source of truth.
[03:20:30.586 --> 03:20:32.988]  We will provide information frequently.
[03:20:33.428 --> 03:20:35.190]  We will share everything we can.
[03:20:35.210 --> 03:20:39.233]  Everything else you see, a grain of salt.
[03:20:39.593 --> 03:20:41.215]  So I continue to share the message.
[03:20:41.415 --> 03:20:42.936]  New Zealanders must prepare.
[03:20:43.496 --> 03:20:44.777]  But do not panic.
[03:20:44.837 --> 03:20:45.558]  Prepare.
[03:20:46.198 --> 03:20:52.844]  And when you see those messages, remember that unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth.
[03:20:53.064 --> 03:20:54.185]  And I really ask people,
[03:20:54.565 --> 03:20:58.586]  Just visit covid19.govt.nz.
[03:20:58.626 --> 03:21:04.128]  It has all of the up-to-date information, and we will continue to provide everything you need to know.
[03:21:05.208 --> 03:21:06.268]  The same thing was said here.
[03:21:06.388 --> 03:21:12.390]  Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and now she works at a big global think tank to quote control disinformation was at the DNC.
[03:21:12.410 --> 03:21:18.152]  And it's important to go back to this because we have Barry Young, who was the head of the three databases, the only one person in New Zealand.
[03:21:18.712 --> 03:21:20.212]  I wonder where they criminally charged him.
[03:21:20.232 --> 03:21:20.812]  He came on the show.
[03:21:20.832 --> 03:21:21.493]  I wonder how he's doing now.
[03:21:21.513 --> 03:21:22.113]  We should get an update.
[03:21:23.052 --> 03:21:24.113]  And he was able to prove it all.
[03:21:24.453 --> 03:21:26.934]  They never even denied that, but they arrested him and indicted him.
[03:21:26.954 --> 03:21:27.795]  Do you have any updates on him?
[03:21:28.095 --> 03:21:31.497]  He's, I believe, still going through the proceedings, Alex, but that's correct.
[03:21:31.517 --> 03:21:35.559]  They're seeking to imprison him, not reveal the data to the public.
[03:21:35.579 --> 03:21:40.502]  In fact, they made Liz Gunn, the journalist who brought it out, pull down the data off the internet.
[03:21:40.522 --> 03:21:41.743]  They wanted it all gone.
[03:21:42.003 --> 03:21:48.366]  They successfully managed, I believe, the first time to pull down Steve Kirsch's data because he published it.
[03:21:48.406 --> 03:21:49.567]  So then he had to go to another.
[03:21:49.827 --> 03:21:51.208]  And again, the names were masked.
[03:21:51.308 --> 03:21:53.149]  But it was the three databases over each other.
[03:21:53.529 --> 03:21:55.010]  He was the one guy that could put them together.
[03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:56.571]  Tell folks what happened.
[03:21:56.771 --> 03:22:01.173]  They went to incredible effort to make sure that all of this data was anonymized.
[03:22:01.573 --> 03:22:09.157]  You could see certain clinics, I suppose, that people were dying in immediately after their injections or shortly thereafter.
[03:22:09.857 --> 03:22:15.340]  But yes, the government went after him, you know, a huge amount of police raiding his home.
[03:22:15.740 --> 03:22:16.841]  I mean, this guy's a hero.
[03:22:16.901 --> 03:22:27.772]  This guy actually was trying to save the world, save his countrymen from going through any more of these lethal injections, from continuing to kill their own people.
[03:22:27.813 --> 03:22:29.154]  He said, I can't live with myself.
[03:22:29.454 --> 03:22:30.415]  My conscience is heavy.
[03:22:30.495 --> 03:22:32.137]  I need to come out with this information.
[03:22:32.457 --> 03:22:36.962]  And he was the controller of the data, therefore very, very strongly positioned.
[03:22:37.282 --> 03:22:37.582]  We're good.
[03:22:56.516 --> 03:22:59.898]  Now you've got a lot of new stuff breaking right now, but it's always important to go back.
[03:23:00.318 --> 03:23:08.662]  They know that as populists, as normal people, we have a defense mechanism that was built into us, you know, by God's design to go through something bad and get over it.
[03:23:08.802 --> 03:23:11.563]  We're not leftist losers, but this is a war.
[03:23:11.583 --> 03:23:14.565]  We're all victims of a bio attack through the release and through the shots.
[03:23:15.185 --> 03:23:25.307]  And we have to bring these people to justice, not just for those they killed and maimed and hurt, the children they put back years in their development, and all the suicides and bankrupt businesses and the doubling of the average billionaire's wealth.
[03:23:25.708 --> 03:23:27.188]  They're already trying to do it again.
[03:23:27.808 --> 03:23:28.208]  They are.
[03:23:28.268 --> 03:23:33.229]  They're trying to get emergency use authorization for the mpox injections.
[03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:41.351]  And I just interviewed recently Tom Renz, Attorney Tom Renz, who said that they may actually run into difficulty with that in the U.S., but maybe not in other countries.
[03:23:41.391 --> 03:23:43.652]  And so he explained legally why that is the case.
[03:23:43.772 --> 03:23:46.012]  And they got emergency authorization for the bird flu mRNA.
[03:23:46.313 --> 03:23:46.693]  They did.
[03:23:46.993 --> 03:23:47.353]  They did.
[03:23:47.673 --> 03:23:50.513]  But I don't know whether they're going to be able to do it with mpox or not.
[03:23:50.673 --> 03:23:52.414]  Either way, they're rushing this through.
[03:23:53.034 --> 03:24:00.615]  You know, as you were speaking about just the other day with Dr. Malone, the emergency declaration for mpox was about to run out.
[03:24:00.655 --> 03:24:02.496]  So Tedros just declares another one.
[03:24:02.516 --> 03:24:07.297]  And of course, we know that this could very well be an injection adverse reaction as well.
[03:24:07.417 --> 03:24:10.597]  I don't know whether there's some sort of an activation that's taking place now.
[03:24:10.697 --> 03:24:12.498]  I don't know whether we're going to see more of this.
[03:24:12.858 --> 03:24:13.498]  I don't think that
[03:24:13.558 --> 03:24:16.300]  They're going to get away with another invisible pandemic, though, Alex.
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:17.340]  Well, that's the good news.
[03:24:17.380 --> 03:24:21.723]  If you go back six months ago, it was the same all over Europe, everywhere, Australia.
[03:24:21.803 --> 03:24:23.684]  Australia pulled the exact same crap.
[03:24:23.724 --> 03:24:27.727]  In fact, even worse, I was seeing all the chickens they were killing, all the rest of it.
[03:24:27.767 --> 03:24:30.268]  But correct me if I'm wrong, you're the expert on that, but I'm going from memory.
[03:24:30.308 --> 03:24:35.191]  But here they said, we're going to PCR test all the cows, PCR test all the chickens.
[03:24:36.332 --> 03:24:38.974]  They told them to turn it up 30 to 40 times what it's supposed to be.
[03:24:39.034 --> 03:24:40.495]  Always the same fraud on its face.
[03:24:41.395 --> 03:24:45.618]  And then they tried to make everybody wear hazmat gear that work around cows.
[03:24:45.638 --> 03:24:46.558]  Everybody just laughed at them.
[03:24:46.578 --> 03:24:50.521]  The cows are fine, the chickens are fine, but they didn't make them kill millions of chickens and thousands of cows.
[03:24:50.861 --> 03:24:52.902]  But that was a few of the corporate farms that bought into it.
[03:24:52.922 --> 03:24:56.544]  They ran newscasts, but people didn't get in line and hysteria, so it didn't work.
[03:24:56.984 --> 03:24:58.285]  And now it's the same thing with monkeypox.
[03:24:58.365 --> 03:24:59.706]  It's 99% gay, man.
[03:24:59.746 --> 03:25:01.607]  They're having all these partners.
[03:25:02.167 --> 03:25:07.871]  And now Wolfgang Werdag, one of the top scientists, former top advisor of the EU, he says, no, it's shingles from the COVID shot.
[03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:09.191]  Yes, yes.
[03:25:09.911 --> 03:25:15.817]  One thing I will mention that did happen at the time when they were trying to launch bird flu in Australia, and you're right Alex, they did.
[03:25:15.837 --> 03:25:20.222]  They went and killed a whole bunch of chickens, shut down a whole bunch of farms as well.
[03:25:20.282 --> 03:25:22.624]  Prematurely, no evidence at all that there was bird flu.
[03:25:22.644 --> 03:25:23.425]  They admitted that?
[03:25:23.465 --> 03:25:23.846]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:25:24.286 --> 03:25:38.201]  And there is one particular farm, and I won't say which farm because we told them we'd keep them anonymous, but I contacted them because they put out a letter to their customers saying, you know, Victorian Agricultural Department has told us that we have to shut down our farm.
[03:25:38.261 --> 03:25:39.703]  None of our birds are sick.
[03:25:40.626 --> 03:25:48.911]  So we actually phoned them as a media organisation to try and gain a better understanding and unfortunately, Alex, this very small family farmer was trusting the government.
[03:25:48.931 --> 03:25:55.996]  He said, oh, you know, they were just trying to keep us safe and, you know, after a while and we worked it out in the end and I just thought, my goodness.
[03:25:56.616 --> 03:25:58.237]  You do not understand.
[03:25:58.297 --> 03:26:10.804]  These people have been systematically attacking the farmers, have been systematically attacking our health, and you're still thinking they're trying to do things in the best interest while they're shutting your business down with no evidence that your animals are sick.
[03:26:11.044 --> 03:26:12.846]  There are still people like that out there.
[03:26:14.166 --> 03:26:14.607]  There are.
[03:26:14.967 --> 03:26:18.889]  And here's the reason why the information is so important.
[03:26:18.949 --> 03:26:20.891]  Because we need to reach those people.
[03:26:20.951 --> 03:26:23.652]  We need to keep getting these broadcasts.
[03:26:23.693 --> 03:26:29.096]  It's all well and good that everyone watching is aware and wants to be well informed and God bless you all for it.
[03:26:29.396 --> 03:26:39.783]  But we can't give up on those outside and we are seeing more and more people are starting to slowly wake up to different aspects of the agenda and so it's important that we continue those efforts.
[03:26:39.923 --> 03:26:43.564]  And let me go back to the question I asked you at the start, but then I talked so much, interrupted so much, you didn't get to it.
[03:26:44.045 --> 03:26:44.705]  You're a smart lady.
[03:26:44.765 --> 03:26:46.146]  Why do you... I want your take on this.
[03:26:46.566 --> 03:26:47.166]  Here's AP.
[03:26:47.246 --> 03:26:47.526]  U.S.
[03:26:47.546 --> 03:26:50.087]  report says fluoride is linked to lower IQ in kids.
[03:26:50.567 --> 03:26:51.428]  We've known this the whole time.
[03:26:51.448 --> 03:26:52.788]  Why do you think they're now admitting this?
[03:26:52.848 --> 03:26:54.309]  I think it's because they've lost so much credibility.
[03:26:54.609 --> 03:26:56.830]  We had Alfie Oaks on from one of the biggest counties in Florida.
[03:26:57.050 --> 03:26:57.890]  They just took the fluoride out.
[03:26:57.930 --> 03:26:58.631]  It's happening everywhere.
[03:26:59.071 --> 03:27:01.712]  I think the system... I know the system's lost a lot of credibility.
[03:27:01.892 --> 03:27:06.116]  Yes, they've lost credibility, they're losing control, so they're trying to claw it back.
[03:27:06.556 --> 03:27:12.161]  People are flooding to becoming more independent, Alex, and that is such a wonderful thing.
[03:27:12.421 --> 03:27:19.848]  That is exactly one of the biggest achievements that independent media, truth-telling media, has achieved, in my opinion.
[03:27:20.028 --> 03:27:20.369]  No, I agree.
[03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:23.451]  That's why we've got to keep revisiting the massive war we were just in and are still in.
[03:27:24.272 --> 03:27:26.233]  Because it will destroy them.
[03:27:26.253 --> 03:27:33.436]  Either they're going to destroy us with this lie of the outbreak hysteria and disease x and operational lockstep, or it destroys them.
[03:27:33.976 --> 03:27:34.556]  And so U.S.
[03:27:34.596 --> 03:27:38.198]  reports this fluoride linked to massive IQ reduction, which we've always known.
[03:27:39.158 --> 03:27:40.479]  Any other reasons you think they're admitting this now?
[03:27:42.606 --> 03:27:46.907]  Probably a way to explain the behavior of the people, Alex, post shots.
[03:27:47.127 --> 03:27:49.447]  The fact that people are behaving- That's what I was thinking this morning.
[03:27:49.868 --> 03:27:50.108]  You know?
[03:27:50.128 --> 03:27:53.088]  They're getting ready to blame fluoride for all the giant neurological plunging.
[03:27:53.648 --> 03:27:54.128]  Possibly.
[03:27:54.369 --> 03:27:55.049]  Very possible.
[03:27:55.389 --> 03:27:59.009]  And so, but of course there'll be some sort of mitigation.
[03:27:59.069 --> 03:28:00.590]  It won't be proper mitigation.
[03:28:00.850 --> 03:28:09.592]  You know, maybe the reason why, I believe it was that article, Alex, that you're referring to, I don't have it in front of me, that they actually said the WHO says X is the safe level.
[03:28:09.632 --> 03:28:10.012]  I think it was 1.5.
[03:28:11.673 --> 03:28:14.716]  That's the safe level, but they mentioned another level.
[03:28:14.736 --> 03:28:18.280]  So maybe they'll just go, you know, to 1 or 0.9.
[03:28:19.562 --> 03:28:21.764]  They won't actually take it all the way to 0.
[03:28:22.905 --> 03:28:23.286]  Exactly.
[03:28:23.326 --> 03:28:25.649]  And guess what they put in the US?
[03:28:25.669 --> 03:28:26.089]  1.6 to 1.8.
[03:28:26.509 --> 03:28:28.332]  So that's almost three, four times.
[03:28:28.953 --> 03:28:29.213]  Yes.
[03:28:29.654 --> 03:28:33.738]  So they might even say, OK, the safe level is 0.5, let's say.
[03:28:33.758 --> 03:28:35.119]  I mean, it shouldn't be in the water at all.
[03:28:35.460 --> 03:28:39.904]  But they might bring it in between, you know, the safe level and what the US standard is now, for example.
[03:28:39.944 --> 03:28:43.908]  This is what they always do to mitigate and still continue to poison us.
[03:28:43.928 --> 03:28:46.911]  This, by the way, goes all the way back to Codex Alimentarius in the 1960s.
[03:28:48.012 --> 03:29:01.458]  Where the WHO and Big Food, Big Ag, all of them decided, OK, we're going to start raising the acceptable amount of poisons in the food supply and actually call nutrients toxins and start systematically bringing those nutrients down.
[03:29:01.838 --> 03:29:08.501]  And this is, you know, especially important because of the conversations that are happening in Chicago right now and are going to start.
[03:29:08.541 --> 03:29:11.323]  It's going to start being widespread because people can't afford to eat.
[03:29:12.083 --> 03:29:20.104]  State-run grocery stores, where the state determines which products will be sold there, you know, razor-thin prices, so people... That's now started in Chicago.
[03:29:20.184 --> 03:29:20.665]  Correct.
[03:29:20.685 --> 03:29:23.165]  So people that are struggling will go there, sadly.
[03:29:23.485 --> 03:29:23.885]  Sadly.
[03:29:23.925 --> 03:29:25.305]  Hopefully not those that are awake.
[03:29:25.705 --> 03:29:31.847]  But there will be people who are struggling that go there, and that way you'll continue to be poisoned, and you can get that everywhere.
[03:29:31.867 --> 03:29:32.487]  We're screwed.
[03:29:32.767 --> 03:29:38.988]  And I did this in the first hour, but since we're talking about it now, guys, pull up the fluoride-based pesticide until the 50s.
[03:29:40.388 --> 03:29:42.591]  That is not even as bad as the fluoride they put in the water.
[03:29:42.651 --> 03:29:45.434]  The hydrofluorosilicic acid is an even worse form of sodium fluoride.
[03:29:45.454 --> 03:29:46.255]  It's the acid form.
[03:29:47.116 --> 03:29:53.964]  And then we also have, in all the stores in America, you go there, the big ones, it says fluoride water for babies to mix with the formula.
[03:29:54.517 --> 03:29:55.378]  Yes, I saw that.
[03:29:56.159 --> 03:29:56.800]  Unbelievable.
[03:29:56.820 --> 03:29:58.602]  I mean, it's on the packaging.
[03:29:58.622 --> 03:29:59.523]  I don't know if you can see the image.
[03:29:59.543 --> 03:29:59.984]  It's on purpose.
[03:30:00.244 --> 03:30:01.125]  They'll pull them both up.
[03:30:01.145 --> 03:30:01.726]  Yeah, great.
[03:30:02.827 --> 03:30:05.530]  To actually admit, to put it on the packaging.
[03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:09.615]  I mean, it's kind of like the packaging for the masks, Alex, where it said does not stop COVID.
[03:30:11.797 --> 03:30:14.698]  A premium lunacy, prime lunacy.
[03:30:14.978 --> 03:30:21.880]  These people treat us as though we're idiots and sadly for many, many years people behaved like idiots, but no more.
[03:30:21.900 --> 03:30:23.560]  We're not going to let them get away with this.
[03:30:23.580 --> 03:30:29.161]  I'm looking at Tedros' comments on social media, Alex, and I'm seeing people just hammering the man.
[03:30:29.201 --> 03:30:30.842]  You will not get away with this again.
[03:30:30.942 --> 03:30:32.042]  It's not happening again.
[03:30:32.362 --> 03:30:35.323]  I don't care how many digital IDs, I don't care how many
[03:30:35.703 --> 03:30:37.945]  You know, at times you pull down my social media posts.
[03:30:38.125 --> 03:30:40.826]  I don't care if there's a blue helmet standing in front of me.
[03:30:41.066 --> 03:30:42.487]  I will not comply.
[03:30:42.767 --> 03:30:45.749]  And I feel that that is the resilience that is built across the world, Alex.
[03:30:45.809 --> 03:30:46.430]  It's growing.
[03:30:46.770 --> 03:30:47.270]  It's growing.
[03:30:47.430 --> 03:30:54.134]  And again, for TV viewers, we just showed you old-fashioned pesticide cans saying fluoride for rats and for roaches.
[03:30:54.655 --> 03:30:57.617]  And then now we'll pull up after that, fluoride water for kids.
[03:30:58.277 --> 03:30:59.197]  Four-year formula.
[03:30:59.417 --> 03:31:08.020]  And they even admit in their old lies that you don't need fluoride, you know, till like five where it causes dental fluorosis if it's done before the teeth fully come in.
[03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:13.742]  And then now, oh look, purified with fluoride for your baby.
[03:31:14.442 --> 03:31:17.303]  I mean, oh look, that's for babies and it's fluoride.
[03:31:17.643 --> 03:31:19.143]  The cold-blooded targeting.
[03:31:19.423 --> 03:31:21.184]  This has been going on at least 50 years in the U.S.
[03:31:22.349 --> 03:31:34.076]  These people really do view us as rats and I've seen these words living lab experiment quite a few times, Alex, and I often reference the Melbourne experiment, which was the testing ground for the whole world, by the way.
[03:31:34.096 --> 03:31:37.058]  And they said that this experiment is going to extend past COVID.
[03:31:37.078 --> 03:31:38.619]  The UN is running this program.
[03:31:38.859 --> 03:31:48.424]  They call it a living lab experiment where they are trying to replicate what they did to the people of Melbourne, 252 days in lockdown, everyone in the world to save the climate.
[03:31:48.464 --> 03:31:49.445]  This is a real thing.
[03:31:49.445 --> 03:31:50.865]  They said we want climate lockdowns next.
[03:31:50.885 --> 03:31:54.026]  Let's go back to Amazon or wherever that was with the baby fluoride water.
[03:31:54.546 --> 03:31:56.807]  And notice the name is Purified Water.
[03:31:56.847 --> 03:31:57.347]  No, it's not.
[03:31:57.387 --> 03:31:58.607]  It's had a deadly poison added.
[03:31:58.887 --> 03:31:59.908]  And look at the reviews.
[03:32:00.348 --> 03:32:01.748]  This is an insult to your baby.
[03:32:01.808 --> 03:32:02.729]  Don't buy this product.
[03:32:03.329 --> 03:32:04.969]  Study this and all labels.
[03:32:05.009 --> 03:32:06.910]  Babies shouldn't drink the chemicals in this product.
[03:32:06.930 --> 03:32:07.870]  Pay attention to labels.
[03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:10.191]  The next person gave it two stars, they gave it one.
[03:32:10.431 --> 03:32:11.371]  The product is fluoride.
[03:32:11.411 --> 03:32:12.852]  Concept, fluoride prevents tooth decay.
[03:32:13.132 --> 03:32:15.433]  Was sold to the public and dentists after World War II.
[03:32:15.513 --> 03:32:17.454]  Do your research on fluoride before buying this product.
[03:32:17.474 --> 03:32:19.875]  Question, how would anyone give babies fluoride in the first place?
[03:32:19.915 --> 03:32:25.217]  Babies do not have teeth, and newborn teeth are replaced with permanent teeth as they grow.
[03:32:25.637 --> 03:32:27.418]  Why add another chemical to the baby's diet?
[03:32:28.398 --> 03:32:46.182]  This is really encouraging to see that, Alex, because it means that people of all persuasions, you know, there are a lot of truthers that wouldn't leave product reviews because they just don't want to, you know, be overly active on the internet, let's say, or they don't want to be identified, they prefer anonymous accounts, they're concerned about their privacy, which I understand all of that.
[03:32:46.202 --> 03:32:47.842]  Yeah, but if you keep hiding, we're going to lose, folks.
[03:32:48.002 --> 03:32:50.383]  It's time to just come out in the open and defeat these people.
[03:32:50.583 --> 03:32:55.385]  I do understand and I agree with you Alex, but I get that aspect as well.
[03:32:55.925 --> 03:33:06.490]  When I see people leaving product reviews like that, I am very encouraged because it means that people from all walks of life now are starting to say, do not poison us anymore.
[03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:09.291]  We're not going to take these products.
[03:33:09.831 --> 03:33:10.872]  Look for alternatives.
[03:33:10.932 --> 03:33:13.654]  People are becoming much more health conscious and we need to.
[03:33:13.694 --> 03:33:16.176]  We need to because we're being poisoned from every single angle.
[03:33:16.236 --> 03:33:17.537]  It's not just in the water.
[03:33:17.877 --> 03:33:19.038]  It's absolutely everywhere.
[03:33:19.078 --> 03:33:19.818]  It's in the skies.
[03:33:19.878 --> 03:33:20.739]  It's in our foods.
[03:33:20.799 --> 03:33:25.983]  It's in grocery, you know, not just packaged foods, but grocery fruits, meats.
[03:33:26.043 --> 03:33:27.744]  They want to put mRNA in everything.
[03:33:27.764 --> 03:33:28.865]  They have vaccine lettuce.
[03:33:28.925 --> 03:33:36.190]  They want, you know, Tennessee went so far as to ban vaccine foods and list them as a drug because of how widespread this problem is.
[03:33:36.210 --> 03:33:36.510]  That's right.
[03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:38.952]  They treat us like feral animals that are too stupid.
[03:33:40.939 --> 03:33:42.099]  To understand what's happening.
[03:33:42.179 --> 03:33:43.700]  Some of the other stuff you didn't get to.
[03:33:44.900 --> 03:33:50.622]  They're hyping cyber attacks, being considered acts of terrorism, so now they claim you're a hacker.
[03:33:51.202 --> 03:34:05.206]  Iran cyber EMP staging for World War III, WF cyber COVID, Biden administration and the digital ID, and that all ties into Iran wants to kill Trump, says the Deep State, so they can kill Trump then blame Iran and go to World War III.
[03:34:05.586 --> 03:34:12.448]  That's right and they were recently also putting out, you know, messaging that Iran's preparing for an EMP against America.
[03:34:12.488 --> 03:34:23.752]  They've got this super weapon and I really think that they are trying to, I'm not a huge fan of Iran by any stretch, but they are trying to position them as the ultimate boogeyman because they want to go to war with Iran.
[03:34:24.292 --> 03:34:28.655]  And so there was just a cyber attack on Halliburton in Texas, Alex.
[03:34:28.675 --> 03:34:34.940]  This is, from what I'm understanding, one of the top US oil fields, Halliburton, which was hit by a cyber attack.
[03:34:35.080 --> 03:34:36.221]  Well, oil drilling companies.
[03:34:36.341 --> 03:34:37.382]  Oil drilling companies.
[03:34:37.962 --> 03:34:44.607]  And the FBI attributed to a gang called Darkside led to a spike in gas prices, panic buying, localized fuel shortages.
[03:34:44.927 --> 03:34:47.129]  And the thing is that we're seeing a lot more of this.
[03:34:47.169 --> 03:34:49.271]  We're seeing this increase in cyberattacks.
[03:34:49.552 --> 03:34:50.412]  And why are we seeing it?
[03:34:50.432 --> 03:34:51.053]  Well, I don't know.
[03:34:51.073 --> 03:34:56.218]  It may have something to do with the fact that Klaus Schwab said, we're going to have more cyberattacks over the next two years.
[03:34:56.498 --> 03:34:59.321]  Just like he said, just like they said, we're going to have a pandemic.
[03:34:59.441 --> 03:35:00.462]  Now this is going to happen.
[03:35:00.482 --> 03:35:02.945]  And he said the cyberattacks will make COVID look like an inconvenience.
[03:35:03.365 --> 03:35:04.245]  Yes, he did.
[03:35:04.345 --> 03:35:18.929]  And there is a very, very important article that I have spoken about before, but I would really love to show people, Alex, if you'll allow me, on the WEF's website about, this is from 2020, what the COVID-19 pandemic teaches us about cyber security.
[03:35:18.969 --> 03:35:20.410]  And they say it's inevitable.
[03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:21.730]  It's going to happen.
[03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:25.091]  There's going to be a major cyber attack, a major cyber outage.
[03:35:25.631 --> 03:35:27.832]  And they say that pandemic cyber attacks
[03:35:28.332 --> 03:35:32.714]  All environmental tipping points are the main things that we're going to be facing.
[03:35:33.814 --> 03:35:36.015]  Of course, everything is related to climate change.
[03:35:36.055 --> 03:35:38.136]  Eventually, cyber attacks will be due to climate change.
[03:35:38.156 --> 03:35:45.459]  But anyway, lesson number one, a cyber attack with characteristics similar to the coronavirus would spread faster and further than any biological virus.
[03:35:45.799 --> 03:35:47.500]  They go on to mention a kill switch.
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:55.943]  And I just found out yesterday, actually, that Julie Inman Grant, the information commissar of Australia, who's trying to censor people from abroad,
[03:35:56.463 --> 03:35:58.544]  Actually has access to that kill switch.
[03:35:58.584 --> 03:36:00.884]  In fact, I believe she is the only one.
[03:36:01.444 --> 03:36:06.366]  And so it says that the end result is that millions of devices would be taken offline in a matter of days.
[03:36:06.406 --> 03:36:15.248]  The only way that they can deal with this is to fully disconnect all vulnerable devices from one another and the internet to avoid infection and listen to this lunacy.
[03:36:15.928 --> 03:36:22.551]  The whole world could experience cyber lockdown until a digital vaccine was developed.
[03:36:22.611 --> 03:36:24.852]  What is that digital vaccine, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:36:24.872 --> 03:36:28.754]  And Alex, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm reading that as digital ID.
[03:36:28.974 --> 03:36:33.876]  That is, we've switched it off, you can't come back, zero trust, you need a digital ID to access the internet.
[03:36:34.196 --> 03:36:35.457]  And that's what the kill switch is.
[03:36:35.477 --> 03:36:37.238]  You only get government and a few corporate sources.
[03:36:37.679 --> 03:36:38.640]  Obama first put it in here.
[03:36:38.660 --> 03:36:41.422]  It's in every country now, as you know, that the globalists control.
[03:36:41.602 --> 03:36:42.483]  That's most nations.
[03:36:43.183 --> 03:36:48.327]  And then they switch everybody off and make you go register and sign up and agree to all these demands to be able to get online.
[03:36:48.567 --> 03:36:49.048]  That's right.
[03:36:49.108 --> 03:36:50.529]  And they've already started.
[03:36:50.909 --> 03:36:58.255]  I've told this story, but Australia put in a digital ID and the next week, the next week, three days later,
[03:36:58.675 --> 03:37:01.997]  A man was trying to renew, they tell you it's all voluntary.
[03:37:02.358 --> 03:37:07.341]  A man was trying to renew his electrician's license to go to work and they told him he can't do it without a digital ID.
[03:37:07.361 --> 03:37:11.704]  Now eventually, he won that matter and he got it because the government says it's voluntary.
[03:37:11.804 --> 03:37:13.045]  But most people just comply.
[03:37:13.485 --> 03:37:16.247]  Yes, but also in that period, Alex, he wasn't allowed to work.
[03:37:16.708 --> 03:37:20.951]  So he could not earn an income in the time that he was arguing about this digital ID.
[03:37:21.271 --> 03:37:23.092]  Now that's while it's voluntary.
[03:37:23.392 --> 03:37:24.573]  Imagine when it's mandatory.
[03:37:24.653 --> 03:37:26.234]  Computer says no, that's it.
[03:37:26.394 --> 03:37:27.015]  AI says no.
[03:37:28.251 --> 03:37:28.711]  Keep going.
[03:37:46.525 --> 03:37:52.288]  Because they are saying we need AI judiciary, we need AI government, we need AI everything.
[03:37:52.568 --> 03:37:55.769]  And they're starting through this incorporation of AI into government.
[03:37:55.829 --> 03:38:00.011]  In fact, I guess we're doing AI in election campaigns now.
[03:38:00.491 --> 03:38:01.912]  I even saw CNN talking about that.
[03:38:03.092 --> 03:38:07.694]  Surprisingly, very fairly reporting on the fact that they believe both sides are doing it.
[03:38:08.534 --> 03:38:14.497]  Again, that goes back to what we were saying before, Alex, about them trying to... Yeah, but Trump's people like us, we just do fun videos that are obvious.
[03:38:14.697 --> 03:38:15.257]  Of course.
[03:38:15.317 --> 03:38:17.438]  You know, where Hillary's a goblin.
[03:38:18.298 --> 03:38:19.599]  They do all sorts of fake stuff.
[03:38:19.659 --> 03:38:30.083]  Yes, no, I agree with you but what I'm trying to say is this is another example of their trying to claw back that appearance of being unbiased and truthful.
[03:38:30.923 --> 03:38:46.956]  But of course, the goal is to eventually collapse everything once they have all the infrastructure set up, which is why I think the Biden admin now, even though that digital ID bill has been sitting there for some time, the last time Biden spoke about it, I believe it was at a State of the Union address, he had a lot of pushback.
[03:38:47.356 --> 03:38:50.678]  And now that pushback's gone because everyone's distracted, I guess.
[03:38:51.178 --> 03:38:53.759]  And so he's quickly looking at signing.
[03:38:54.419 --> 03:38:55.800]  I don't know if he's signed it yet, Alex.
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:38:57.441]  Maybe you can correct me there.
[03:38:57.461 --> 03:38:59.002]  But he's looking at signing that.
[03:38:59.342 --> 03:39:02.203]  And once that goes in, I'm telling you, there's no going back.
[03:39:02.283 --> 03:39:06.946]  And then also, it openly lets the feds give illegals driver's licenses, because they already have the states doing it.
[03:39:07.306 --> 03:39:08.326]  But now it's going to be the feds.
[03:39:09.947 --> 03:39:10.847]  Close and comment in a minute.
[03:39:10.887 --> 03:39:11.348]  Great job.
[03:39:11.368 --> 03:39:12.528]  Glad to meet you in person.
[03:39:12.888 --> 03:39:13.869]  Great seeing you on the other shows.
[03:39:16.102 --> 03:39:19.906]  I'll be up here tonight with live coverage the last night of the DNC.
[03:39:20.807 --> 03:39:23.069]  And I want to just say Chase Dyers was doing a great job.
[03:39:23.089 --> 03:39:24.150]  He did a great job last night.
[03:39:24.370 --> 03:39:27.113]  Maria Z, my son, Rex did a great job last night.
[03:39:27.153 --> 03:39:29.295]  Maybe I'll invite him up here with me tonight.
[03:39:29.736 --> 03:39:31.397]  But we'll be up here covering Kamala Harris.
[03:39:31.457 --> 03:39:35.581]  I mean, she only popped out twice for a minute and a half and could barely talk reading off teleprompters.
[03:39:35.621 --> 03:39:36.062]  I don't know how
[03:39:36.542 --> 03:39:39.824]  She's going to give a speech because she's reportedly so drunk all the time.
[03:39:40.645 --> 03:39:45.508]  And so Owen Schroer is taking a well-deserved vacation with some family.
[03:39:45.528 --> 03:39:51.672]  So coming up, you're going to have Chase Geiser, who's going to be hosting the War Room 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:39:51.692 --> 03:39:52.453]  They will take a break.
[03:39:53.113 --> 03:39:56.697]  We'll have the refeeds of the shows until 7 o'clock tonight.
[03:39:56.717 --> 03:40:01.522]  We'll kick it back on and cover these people and get the clips out so you don't have to actually watch it.
[03:40:01.542 --> 03:40:02.803]  If you don't want to watch it, I understand why.
[03:40:03.283 --> 03:40:10.130]  We'll have some fun with them, obviously, but we'll have a lot of clips on X and Infowars.com of the outrageous crap they say, like last night.
[03:40:10.711 --> 03:40:11.812]  Oh, no, that's fake numbers.
[03:40:11.832 --> 03:40:13.253]  We didn't fudge eight
[03:40:14.354 --> 03:40:15.415]  118,000 jobs?
[03:40:15.455 --> 03:40:16.175]  Trump made that up.
[03:40:16.495 --> 03:40:18.737]  Well, your Labor Department says it's from them.
[03:40:19.077 --> 03:40:19.657]  That doesn't exist.
[03:40:19.677 --> 03:40:20.357]  I don't know what that is.
[03:40:20.718 --> 03:40:21.938]  That's the head of the Commerce Department.
[03:40:21.958 --> 03:40:22.899]  I mean, this is next level.
[03:40:22.979 --> 03:40:25.100]  Or Kamala was a great border czar.
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:26.761]  They just said two weeks ago she wasn't a border czar.
[03:40:27.181 --> 03:40:29.242]  We'll have all that covered tonight.
[03:40:29.642 --> 03:40:32.544]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, the front page of InfoWars.
[03:40:32.564 --> 03:40:34.125]  You'll see our live feed at 7 p.m.
[03:40:34.145 --> 03:40:37.026]  You'll also see it at Real Alex Jones on X. Be sure and follow us there.
[03:40:37.046 --> 03:40:38.027]  Maria Zia, we will follow you.
[03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:50.461]  You can find me always at zmedia.com, that's z-triple-e-media.com, and on X, at zz-triple-e-underscore-media, and Telegram, and a bunch of other places.
[03:40:50.501 --> 03:40:53.144]  But those are the two main platforms that I'm posting on.
[03:40:54.024 --> 03:41:02.632]  And, of course, you can find me Tuesdays, usually at 2pm Central, guest hosting the Alex Jones Show, which I am very, very honoured to be doing.
[03:41:02.712 --> 03:41:08.017]  Alex has tremendously impacted my life over the years, from my teenage years onwards.
[03:41:08.558 --> 03:41:16.125]  And if it wasn't for him, and if it wasn't for InfoWars, I'm not sure that I would be as aware of my surroundings as I am today.
[03:41:16.225 --> 03:41:18.507]  This network is so incredibly important.
[03:41:18.507 --> 03:41:18.967]  Well, thank you.
[03:41:18.987 --> 03:41:23.551]  That's why they're trying to shut it down, and we have woken up and helped a lot of people, but now you're waking up and helping people.
[03:41:24.032 --> 03:41:43.788]  It's going to be Pocahontas tonight, Mark Kelly, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the true demon, Roy Cooper, Representative Alan Kinzinger, the neocon, Ryan, our representative, Maxwell Frost, and, of course, a bunch of other New World Order garbage, and, of course, the cackling hyena herself, Kamala Harris, who didn't get one vote in the primaries.
[03:41:44.228 --> 03:41:44.589]  All right!
[03:41:45.109 --> 03:41:46.390]  The War Room's coming up next.
[03:41:46.450 --> 03:41:48.631]  Please share it, please watch, and we'll see you tonight.
[03:41:48.651 --> 03:41:49.131]  God bless.
[03:42:00.015 --> 03:42:08.019]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high-quality supplements.
[03:42:09.042 --> 03:42:15.444]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:42:16.284 --> 03:42:31.309]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:42:31.669 --> 03:42:33.549]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:38.631]  Three of them notified us that, we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[03:42:39.378 --> 03:42:45.041]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:42:45.061 --> 03:42:47.922]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:42:48.742 --> 03:43:02.169]  And they said, listen, you know we were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label
[03:43:03.451 --> 03:43:07.494]  On our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:07.894 --> 03:43:11.177]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[03:43:11.217 --> 03:43:17.982]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling our products and a lot of the products that we developed.
[03:43:18.662 --> 03:43:26.528]  But so many of these products that they had put out, again, were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[03:43:27.535 --> 03:43:35.639]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:43:35.719 --> 03:43:42.342]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:43:42.502 --> 03:43:45.003]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:43:45.163 --> 03:43:47.084]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:43:47.284 --> 03:43:57.070]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:43:57.691 --> 03:44:00.092]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:00.152 --> 03:44:01.193]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:02.874 --> 03:44:09.577]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:09.697 --> 03:44:15.339]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:44:15.459 --> 03:44:24.003]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:44:24.043 --> 03:44:26.104]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:44:27.734 --> 03:44:41.027]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:44:41.527 --> 03:44:45.911]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:44:45.971 --> 03:44:50.616]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:44:50.876 --> 03:44:51.356]  We're good to go!
[03:44:51.396 --> 03:44:51.816]  We're good to go!
[03:44:51.836 --> 03:44:52.636]  We're good to go!
[03:44:52.856 --> 03:44:53.617]  We're good to go!
[03:44:53.657 --> 03:44:54.697]  We're good to go!
[03:44:54.717 --> 03:44:55.497]  We're good to go!
[03:44:55.517 --> 03:44:56.177]  We're good to go!
[03:44:56.237 --> 03:44:56.877]  We're good to go!
[03:44:56.897 --> 03:44:57.917]  We're good to go!
[03:44:57.937 --> 03:44:58.738]  We're good to go!
[03:44:58.758 --> 03:44:59.158]  We're good to go!
[03:44:59.218 --> 03:44:59.738]  We're good to go!
[03:44:59.758 --> 03:45:00.298]  We're good to go!
[03:45:00.358 --> 03:45:00.998]  We're good to go!
[03:45:01.018 --> 03:45:01.918]  We're good to go!
[03:45:02.038 --> 03:45:02.738]  We're good to go!
[03:45:02.758 --> 03:45:03.359]  We're good to go!
[03:45:03.399 --> 03:45:03.999]  We're good to go!
[03:45:04.079 --> 03:45:04.779]  We're good to go!
[03:45:04.799 --> 03:45:05.359]  We're good to go!
[03:45:05.419 --> 03:45:06.059]  We're good to go!
[03:45:06.079 --> 03:45:07.199]  We're good to go!
[03:45:07.319 --> 03:45:07.939]  We're good to go!
[03:45:07.959 --> 03:45:08.660]  We're good to go!
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:09.260]  We're good to go!
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:10.340]  We're good to go!
[03:45:10.420 --> 03:45:11.000]  We're good to go!
[03:45:11.020 --> 03:45:11.620]  We're good to go!
[03:45:11.640 --> 03:45:12.160]  We're good to go!
