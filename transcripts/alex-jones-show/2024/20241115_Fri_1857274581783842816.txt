[00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:10.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, you were told by the mainstream media and by the press, by the Democrats today, that InfoWars was sold in an auction yesterday.
[00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:12.919]  That did not happen.
[00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.100]  It was an emergency hearing in front of the bankruptcy judge, Chris Lopez today, and he said, this is not an auction.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.640]  You didn't allow higher bidders.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.820]  The definition of an auction is sold to the highest bidder.
[00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:31.140]  You kept secret the fact that you gave it to someone that paid way less money.
[00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.859]  Turns out it wasn't even real money.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.259]  It was a promise to pay money.
[00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:36.899]  The judge didn't certify it.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.179]  He said, I haven't even agreed to when the auction is.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.219]  He said, we have to have hearings about the details of it and what's actually being sold.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.200]  So they thought they would slip this through with a U.S. trustee from the Justice Department.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.719]  And they had the sale yesterday, said they wouldn't tell us until this morning, showed up to shut the building.
[00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.090]  Cut off the studio electricity while we were on air.
[00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.490]  Then I went to our backup studios, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.090]  Find out more at AJNLive on X.com.
[00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.609]  And they did announce that they bought it.
[00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.790]  They did announce they have it.
[00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.629]  But the judge said this was not an auction.
[00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.950]  That's a quote in the transcript.
[00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.269]  And he was just flabbergasted and totally blown away and said that he's going to investigate with this big hearing coming up next week.
[00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.010]  So this is total lawfare.
[00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.950]  It's craziness.
[00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.609]  It's been open season on me the whole time.
[00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.709]  The last trustee from the Justice Department, he fired June 14th.
[00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:29.129]  Look it up.
[00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.510]  Pat McGill, who tried to come in and close the place without a court order.
[00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.989]  The judge said, why did you do that?
[00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.150]  And it's because...
[00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.150]  They are talking to the Democrats and these law firms and these people and that's where they get this from.
[00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.549]  And they're just desperate to get me off the air and they don't want somebody that's friendly to me to keep me on the air buying it.
[00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.629]  So they said they had an auction, but it was a secret private sale masquerading as an auction because that's what the federal law says they have to do.
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.329]  So this is a major scandal.
[00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.469]  That's what went on.
[00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.890]  The Onion did not buy it.
[00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590]  The judge said the sale did not go through.
[00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.750]  There's a big hearing.
[00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.430]  And this is in Bloomberg.
[00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:05.090]  It isn't AP, but it's buried in the articles.
[00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.849]  This is a huge scandal.
[00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.590]  This is a giant deal.
[00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.469]  But through color of law, the feds came in and shut down the Infowars system today, but we're on our backup.
[00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.169]  God bless you.
[00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.669]  That's what happened.
