[00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:28.329]  It's Monday, November 25th, 2024. The Biden coup has openly announced a plan to consider giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine to attack Russia.
[00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.969]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.729]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.729]  A year ago, I warned you that NATO was seriously considering giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.030]  Then in October, I raised the alarm again and I got fact-checked by the corporate media.
[00:00:46.210 --> 00:01:02.079]  Well, now, the Biden administration just hours ago floated the idea in the New York Times with senior administration officials saying that They want to stop Trump in 55 days when he gets into office,
[00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.200]  being able to stop the war, so they want to escalate.
[00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.879]  I'm going to show you the New York Times, the quotes of the unnamed officials.
[00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:12.579]  These are the people that are really in control.
[00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:22.099]  These are the ones I said last week, we need to see the impeachment of Biden and Harris and haul up Blinken and others from the State Department who are really running all this.
[00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.159]  This is nuclear blackmail against the world if the people of the planet demand peace.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.140]  I have the New York Times article.
[00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.439]  It's about a paywall, but we've got a copy of it.
[00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.540]  It's also quoted in Zero Hedge.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.379]  It's up on Infowars.com as well.
[00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.319]  The magnitude of this is staggering.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.200]  This is the greatest nuclear escalation of the nuclear age since they were proliferated in the 1950s.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:13.560]  And since it started with the dropping of Fat Man and Little Boy on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and you see the continued escalation of heavier and more advanced weapons, and now France announced yesterday they're going to join the US and the UK in bombing inside Russia with high-powered,
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.479]  precision, nuclear-capable missiles.
[00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:36.960]  You have Putin last week raining an intermediate-range ballistic missile down on a military factory complex and saying this is to show we can get past your missile defense systems and we could have delivered multiple nuclear warheads on that missile.
[00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.080]  Smaller missiles, five.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.620]  Larger ones, up to 25 or more.
[00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.800]  You can put a hundred MIRVs inside of a starship.
[00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.960]  That's just a giant ballistic missile.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.680]  If you go up to Real Alex Jones on X, we'll put it on screen.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.599]  End of the world alert.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.500]  The Biden administration is proposing the transfer of nuclear weapons to Ukraine to be used against Russia.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.580]  This constitutes the greatest and most dangerous nuclear escalation in history.
[00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.500]  Must watch, share, live, feed.
[00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:19.250]  Now, this is obviously horrible news, but we knew this was coming.
[00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:30.590]  I'm on record saying I would expect this once President Trump was elected to hold a nuclear gun to his head, your head, every man, woman, and child's head on the planet.
[00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:39.509]  People don't tend to listen to me when I'm in the present tense, but they do listen when they see something from the past tense.
[00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.830]  So have an archivist find that.
[00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:41.530]  We even have the dates.
[00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.449]  I even found the videos.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.020]  Where I said it, here's one of them.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.120]  Emergency report.
[00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.960]  President Xi orders Chinese military to prepare for imminent world war in response to NATO's plan to give nukes to Ukraine.
[00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.500]  That video only got 1.5 million views.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.620]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:00.300]  It's not.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.539]  I do videos every day that get 50-60 million views.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.759]  Individually.
[00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.419]  Should have gotten 100 million views.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.599]  It got fact-checked, though, and they said, that's not true.
[00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.870]  Really, I just had Bill newspaper reporting it, and Zelensky saying he's two weeks from nukes, and NATO previous leaked proposals for it.
[00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.990]  Now there is nuclear war alert, Ukraine to be given nuclear weapons under secret NATO plan October 17th.
[00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:39.649]  So, and now they're openly proposing it, we'll break it all down, When we come back, stay with us.
[00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:53.709]  Still trending, as of this morning, on the top of X, the number one social site in the world, is Will Elon Musk buy MSNBC? Will Elon Musk buy Infowars?
[00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.449]  And Elon has said he's interested in both.
[00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.810]  Now, that, though, should not be trending the top.
[00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:18.980]  And as of 10 minutes ago, before I went live, it was still not trending at the top, but should be trending at the top, but I'm sure it will be, instead of the NFL and Monday Night Football.
[00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.660]  U.S. officials discussed giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.120]  That is in the New York Times today.
[00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.529]  And I have the whole article here in front of me.
[00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.149]  It's behind a paywall, but we have the whole thing.
[00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.709]  I posted it on X and posted it on Infowars.com because it is of massive public interest, obviously.
[00:05:45.370 --> 00:06:01.589]  So, when you read what they say, and I'll read it to you, senior U.S. officials, Blinken, the CIA director and others, Secretary of State and others, say, well, Trump's about to get in in 55 days.
[00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:07.250]  And we want to escalate things to make sure we don't give up to Russia.
[00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:15.050]  And so the answer is give nuclear weapons to Ukraine so they can nuke Russia if they don't stop.
[00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:30.290]  Well, no, Russia invaded because they said you're planning to make them a NATO member and give them nukes and use them as the trigger for war with Russia, which the neocons have been proposing for decades, working with Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was their main strategist.
[00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:45.240]  And now, for over a week, the United States, England, and now France is joining them, are bombing inside Russia with precision-heavy cruise missiles.
[00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.220]  So, this has already gone on.
[00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:53.740]  There's already been leaks out of NATO. There's already been prestigious publications.
[00:06:54.459 --> 00:07:02.360]  By prestigious, I mean, build is globalist, but it's pretty accurate on military issues.
[00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.350]  Bild reported a month ago that Ukraine was two weeks from nukes.
[00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:11.250]  Got top NATO officials calls on business leaders to prepare for wartime scenario.
[00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.769]  Germany and Sweden have told citizens get ready for nuclear war.
[00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:18.050]  New York City is running TV ads of what to do during a nuclear war.
[00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.850]  They actually say click on the local city app and go in your house if nuclear war happens.
[00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.949]  That's the last place you want to be and there won't be any city apps operating during it.
[00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:36.730]  It's like giving somebody a band-aid for being Shot in the head with a 12-gauge at point-blank range.
[00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.209]  Now, we didn't plan it this way.
[00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:45.970]  We didn't know this would break today, but General Flynn's been planning to come to Austin for a few weeks to be on the show.
[00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.430]  He is here in the second and third hour today.
[00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:59.689]  So in 51 minutes, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former top national security advisor to President Trump, and current advisor to him will be sitting right there.
[00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.750]  Six, seven feet away from me.
[00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:15.129]  So, it'll be good to be able to talk to him, one of the leading experts on this, on the military, geopolitical systems, threat escalation ladders, and more.
[00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:26.930]  But when you read the New York Times article, it is stunning how honest they are that they want to escalate things and have total war before Trump gets in to stop a peace deal.
[00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:33.830]  And that's what the missile attacks have been about in the last week inside Russia by NATO. That is...
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:45.679]  What all the announcements of imminent nuclear war and different public officials and the head of the Ukrainian military saying World War III has already begun.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.559]  He said that 36 hours after I said within days you'll be hearing World War III has begun.
[00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:56.980]  The chilling article hides behind a milquetoast headline.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.799]  Trump's vow to end the war could leave Ukraine with few options.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.980]  One question is whether the new administration in Europe will provide security guarantees to prevent Russia from taking more territory.
[00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:16.090]  Then you read the article by Helen Cooper, Andrew Kramer, Eric Schmidt, Julian Barnes.
[00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:23.269]  They say administration officials are proposing...
[00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:26.149]  Giving nuclear weapons.
[00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:32.149]  So, a few months ago I was proposing giving them hypersonic missiles you can put nukes on.
[00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:35.169]  And Russia said if you move those up to our border, it'll be an act of war.
[00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.990]  We'll be at war with you.
[00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.990]  If you use them, we will be at war with you.
[00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.590]  Now that's been done.
[00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:45.070]  And now they're saying, okay, we're looking to give them, and look, it's the same missile, same bomb.
[00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.190]  They attack them.
[00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:54.299]  We're going to go ahead and just load hydrogen bombs on those.
[00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:56.500]  So that escalated quickly.
[00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:05.320]  Several officials even suggested that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.639]  Well, yeah, Russia had nukes stationed there.
[00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.960]  So the idea that it's returning, I mean, the U.S. Oh, oh, Russia took those.
[00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:12.860]  Here, you have some.
[00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.440]  Here.
[00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.700]  You play with a flamethrower in a firework factory.
[00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.200]  Let's go back to the piece.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:28.259]  Several officials even suggest that Mr. Biden could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:38.019]  That would be an instant and enormous deterrent, but such a step would be complicated and have serious implications.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.080]  Uh, yeah.
[00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:43.980]  The mother of all Megamack escalations.
[00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:47.820]  So...
[00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.110]  We'll read more of it here in a moment.
[00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:55.190]  It's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.389]  It's all up at Real Alex Jones on X. To say this is insane is an understatement.
[00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:03.529]  I'm here calmly covering it.
[00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.269]  We've known this was coming.
[00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.590]  This is the trajectory.
[00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:21.600]  I've read articles last week where the globalists are saying, hey, a nuclear war would cleanse the earth of overpopulation, then the shadow government can emerge from its bunkers and build its new utopian society.
[00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:26.120]  And what's really interesting is...
[00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:36.450]  When senior NATO diplomats and officials leaked this as a trial balloon in October, I went and looked it up and said, yeah, Zelensky's asked for nukes.
[00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:41.090]  Zelensky's saying he could be two weeks from nukes, kind of wink-wink, they're already here to Russia.
[00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:42.730]  Whether that's true or not, I don't know.
[00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:49.740]  To try to get Russia to make some moves that would then legitimize NATO openly entering the war.
[00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:52.919]  And during the New York Times, they admit that.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.279]  We need to escalate this so NATO can officially come in and save Ukraine.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.179]  And again, then Russia escalates again and China joins in and North Korea is already joining in.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.679]  They've got defense alliances and defense treaties with Russia.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.059]  And we're not in the beginning stages of World War III then, which you're already in the beginning stages.
[00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:14.200]  We're now leaving the first...
[00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:21.470]  Third of the beginning of World War III. We've been the last few years in the beginnings of it.
[00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:32.250]  Now we're leaving the preparatory phase, the beginning of World War III, and entering the start of the official World War.
[00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:42.470]  And then that, in every war game, escalates into limited nuclear strikes, and then retaliatory, and then escalatory, and then total commitment.
[00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.129]  An orgy of spasmodic Releases.
[00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:51.389]  And then India decides to go ahead or Pakistan decides to go ahead and nuke.
[00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:52.710]  Vice versa.
[00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.929]  China decides to nuke.
[00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:58.690]  And then it's just everywhere.
[00:12:59.429 --> 00:13:07.289]  And then the reactors melt down all over the planet that are much worse than the radiation going off and bombs thousands of times depending on how bad the meltdown is.
[00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.210]  And it is the end of the world as we know it.
[00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:14.929]  So if you thought the new world order...
[00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:24.110]  And the bankers that are coming to the end of their big Ponzi scheme, trying to launch their world government, their cashless society, carbon tax grid, we're going to give up.
[00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:35.909]  Think again, you haven't studied the psychology, the criminology, the sociopathy of megalomaniacs.
[00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:39.509]  So that's where we are.
[00:13:41.509 --> 00:14:00.289]  On Monday, November 25th, 2024, that's why Trump for weeks has been in constant, ongoing negotiations and true diplomacy with all the major players in NATO and with the Russians,
[00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.750]  the Chinese, and others.
[00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:07.889]  Phone calls with Zelensky, phone calls with Putin, and the media getting wind of that saying, how dare them?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.580]  Elon Musk involved trying to get Iran not to strike back so Israel can have its expansion of war.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.419]  And the media is saying, how dare him?
[00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:21.039]  How dare Elon Musk be talking to Putin and Zelensky?
[00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:22.980]  How dare them?
[00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.360]  They are the villains.
[00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.059]  Elon Musk is bad.
[00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:29.580]  He doesn't want a nuclear war.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.919]  Donald Trump is evil.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.259]  He doesn't want a nuclear war.
[00:14:44.450 --> 00:15:05.049]  So, I am almost at a speechless point right now, because if you study military history, if you study threat, threat doctrine, military postures, threat escalation ladders, and they don't want a peace deal,
[00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:13.419]  the neocons, the globalist power is coming to an end, A new era of peace and renaissance could be here.
[00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:30.320]  Instead of their great reset and poverty and social credit scores and AI nightmare, tyranny, sane people could be in charge and we could avert total disaster.
[00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:37.480]  But the general public has a normalcy bias.
[00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:51.139]  And if I got a group of fellow sports fans together and we went down to the Texas Capitol and waved our team's banners and painted our faces up, we'd be good Americans.
[00:15:52.159 --> 00:16:04.139]  But if we all got together and protested at all the capitals and demanded a stop to nuclear war escalation and the deepening of World War III, why, we're weirdos.
[00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:06.679]  And so there is an extreme...
[00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:15.379]  Geopolitical military lack of knowledge.
[00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:22.059]  A massive historical military illiteracy.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:41.909]  And people have lived in relative peace and harmony for so long in the lap of luxury, living off the freedoms and liberties and Prosperity that our forebears toiled to build,
[00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:53.210]  that there is a very good chance that we're bare minimum going to be in a full conventional war with Russia and China.
[00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:08.809]  And if that happens, then it is a probability, according to all metrics and analyses, Of total nuclear war.
[00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.329]  And you have all the European government saying get ready for imminent war.
[00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:18.630]  You got 800,000 German troops ready to invade Ukraine.
[00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:24.190]  You have the defense minister saying prepare for nuclear war.
[00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.569]  You might want to have a week of food and water on hand.
[00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:32.089]  So when your house gets blown over on top of you, I guess, you can find it.
[00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.250]  You might live a week or so.
[00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.950]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:17:40.089 --> 00:17:42.130]  This is going to end all the woke stuff real quick.
[00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.230]  I mean, this is going to end the football games real fast.
[00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:58.029]  Meanwhile, the UN, the CDC, the usual suspects ahead of Trump getting in.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.839]  We're good to go.
[00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:42.869]  First case of bird flu infection in U.S. child confirmed in California, CDC. Bird flu found in California raw milk, and all they do is take a PCR test, turn it up 30, 40 times,
[00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:54.910]  its detector, point it at the milk, and then they get a bird flu reading and say, bird flu, and oh, everybody's wearing hazmat gear, and you can't sell this, you gotta destroy it.
[00:18:56.109 --> 00:19:00.369]  They already killed half the chickens this year in Australia with the same PCR crap.
[00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.430]  Let me explain it again.
[00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:08.509]  The inventor of the PCR test died a few years ago, but he explained that even when you set it right, it just is an indicator there might be something.
[00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.609]  You've got to do further tests.
[00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:14.569]  But he said if you turn it up any higher than it's supposed to be, you get false positives.
[00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:28.970]  If you turn it up 20, 30, 40 times, and the CDC would just order the people with the PCR test during the COVID history to turn it up, You can point it at the air and it's going to say there's COVID or bird flu or whatever they want.
[00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.970]  And I use the analogy because it's the same thing really of a metal detector.
[00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.569]  You can go to Walmart or wherever and buy a $150 metal detector.
[00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:40.990]  And it'll have different knobs on it.
[00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.849]  You can set it to steel or iron or gold or silver or whatever, nickel, whatever you're looking for.
[00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:49.670]  So you set it for that resonance of that metal.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.900]  And then it sends out magnetic waves, it mounts back, and it reads that with a computer chip in it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:12.720]  So you've got what you set it to, and you've also got the other knobs, but depending on how complex the bell ticker is, where you turn up the sensitivity, and if you turn it up even halfway and aim it at the ground, it's going to tell you everything's there.
[00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:13.740]  Gold, silver, you name it.
[00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:17.420]  If there's nothing there, it's just turned up so high, it's just feeding back.
[00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:18.799]  Like if you...
[00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:23.309]  Turn up an amplifier all the way and then stick the microphone up to it.
[00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:25.230]  It's feedback.
[00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:32.950]  So, you can aim a metal detector in the air and turn it all the way up.
[00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.869]  Turn on low, turn on one, aim it in the air.
[00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.349]  Nothing.
[00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:37.529]  Turn up halfway.
[00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:39.849]  Turn all the way up.
[00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.710]  So, this is completely transparent horse crap.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.339]  But they're definitely getting that ready for Trump to try to stabilize things.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.500]  They've got war in beyond high gear.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.519]  Balls the walls.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.079]  Bum rush.
[00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:07.019]  You've got mayors and Democrats saying we need armed uprisings of black people against Trump.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.880]  He's going to kill you.
[00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:12.839]  You've got the mayor of Denver saying we're going to physically resist with citizens' ice when they come to Denver.
[00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.420]  Yeah, I forgot about Fauci.
[00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:20.609]  That was back in the mid-90s.
[00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.289]  Tens of thousands of kids he tested AIDS drugs on that didn't even have AIDS until they died.
[00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:32.390]  Yeah, he doesn't just remove the larynxes of beagles and then put flesh-eating worms on them.
[00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:35.849]  No, he kills kids.
[00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:44.450]  So, these are psychotic frauds.
[00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:58.289]  And If you study criminology with any psychotic or even a sociopath, in the case of serial killers is a good snapshot example.
[00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:08.130]  They'll go out and do their first few murders and be real careful about it and plan it out and wear gloves and get rid of the body properly.
[00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:16.670]  But by the 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 20th person they kill, they start getting reckless, getting crazy because subconsciously they hate themselves.
[00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.019]  They want to stop.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.799]  They want to be caught.
[00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.339]  They'll start a lot of times mailing letters to the police.
[00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:25.039]  You're stupid.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.019]  You can't stop me.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.839]  I'm in the strike of the next week.
[00:22:34.299 --> 00:22:35.920]  And that's what Fauci is.
[00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:37.119]  That's what Bill Gates is.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.299]  They get off on it.
[00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.650]  Bill Gates, yeah, we just take experimental mRNA and modify the kids' genetics.
[00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.289]  We just shoot it right in their vein.
[00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.970]  I mean, yeah, we're going to kill old ladies and that's a dead panel.
[00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:55.190]  Yeah, we got to cut the carbon of people down to zero.
[00:22:55.369 --> 00:22:55.849]  You know what that means?
[00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.549]  Get rid of all the people.
[00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.630]  And the TED TV crowd laughs because they're in on the death cult.
[00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:07.029]  They're not really in the death cult, but they've been indoctrinated and there's too many people and we're going to have government-forced assisted suicide.
[00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.089]  You know, they read the New York Times, looking forward to the end of humans, Wall Street Journal, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:16.250]  The future's not...
[00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.130]  And they're just self-appointed psychotics.
[00:23:20.589 --> 00:23:27.730]  And now, I've been telling you they're going to give those missiles to the Ukrainians once President Trump's president-elect...
[00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:38.089]  And then they're going to start bombing, and then all these other NATO countries, I said first it'll be the US, then England, then France, because that's how they always do it.
[00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:40.869]  And next it'll be Poland, starts bombing.
[00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:46.650]  And then if the Russians don't escalate like they want back, they can't be baited into it.
[00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.130]  Well, we'll just give nuclear weapons to Ukraine then.
[00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:59.410]  And that way, I guess they think in history, when nuclear war starts, they'll go, oh, it wasn't NATO did this, it was Ukraine, and they were invaders, they had a right to use nukes.
[00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:01.839]  That's the weird legalese.
[00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:32.130]  They think their world government will survive the nuclear war and they'll have their big show trials and go after all their enemies and then their judges at the UN whatever underground base they're holding these hearings at in the future that they will be history's victors and they're doing it all legal they think ending the world as we know it all legal and they're here's really what I'm saying You got the
[00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:39.869]  Secretary of Defense and you got the neocons bolting all up and running around saying, oh, Russia's bluffing.
[00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.789]  They won't do anything.
[00:24:41.069 --> 00:24:42.130]  Let's just keep bombing them.
[00:24:42.329 --> 00:24:43.849]  And Russia's not bluffing.
[00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.309]  Invaded Ukraine.
[00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.190]  ICBM attack.
[00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.190]  Demonstration of a nuclear strike.
[00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:53.369]  Evading the countermeasures.
[00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.250]  And the globalist answer is...
[00:24:58.529 --> 00:24:59.349]  Oh, it's just a bluff.
[00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.650]  No, no.
[00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:01.210]  They know it's not a bluff.
[00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:17.170]  They are starting and have already started World War III, and now they want it to be a nuclear World War III, and they, large groups of people in the government and in the globalist system, know they're going to lose power, know their New World Order is about to fail, their long 100-year plan,
[00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:26.690]  their transhumanist death cult plan, their eugenicist death cult plan, and so they are openly trying to destroy the Earth, the surface of it.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:35.920]  That's their attack on all the populations, on all the populist movements, on folks that don't want to eat bugs, the people that don't want to live under social credit score.
[00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:38.599]  And they're like, really, you think you're going to get out of this?
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:45.000]  It's like a guy that beats his wife and has broken her jaw, broken her arm, puts cigarettes out on her.
[00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:50.900]  And finally, one night at 3 a.m., the dog barks and he looks out and she's getting in the car with the kids.
[00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.390]  And he runs out there with a gun and she's driving off.
[00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.990]  So he bears down and shoots into the back window and the car pulls over to the side.
[00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:03.269]  He goes over and open the car and one of his kids is bleeding to death.
[00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.670]  The wife's been shot in the back of the head.
[00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.529]  Her brains are everywhere.
[00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:07.390]  And then what does he do?
[00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:10.069]  He just kicks the gun in his mouth before the cops get there.
[00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.750]  That happens all the time.
[00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:19.150]  And so we're with our kids out at the minivan at 3 a.m.
[00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.710]  and Rover starts barking.
[00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:26.829]  So the psychotic drunk husband goes, what's going on?
[00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:35.049]  He looks out the window and sees the wife running with suitcases and the five-year-old and the three-year-old climbing in the side of the minivan.
[00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:37.069]  And he goes, that bitch.
[00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.650]  That's the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Bloomberg, all of them.
[00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:42.930]  He's got the gun.
[00:26:43.589 --> 00:26:45.769]  And he's bearing down right now.
[00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:47.190]  She's driving out of the driveway.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.380]  So that's it.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.220]  They're gonna kill everybody.
[00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:01.079]  Including themselves.
[00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:02.000]  They'll never get away with it.
[00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:02.619]  They'll all die too.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.099]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.480]  Stay with us.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.980]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 win.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.119]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero sum game.
[00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:16.259]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.539]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.

[00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:09.470]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at Real Alex Jones here on X. All right, General Flynn is in the green room studying the latest developments.
[00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:13.130]  I just walked by and saw him in there heavily in thought, so I didn't bother him.
[00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:19.890]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 26 minutes here in studio for several hours.
[00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:23.230]  Former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.509]  Could not have a better guest with the news we're covering here.
[00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:39.569]  Let me just recap what I just talked about and then get into all the details here and give you my analysis and how dangerous this is, where this is going, and how we can collectively stop it.
[00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.190]  But the first thing I want to say is this.
[00:28:42.069 --> 00:28:49.009]  Pray to God to intercess and to touch the hearts and minds of people at every level connected to this to de-escalate.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.160]  Pray that the globalists will be exposed.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.759]  Pray that more whistleblowers will come out.
[00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:17.140]  Personally put pressure on Congress by people like Senator Paul and Howley and congressmen, some of the other congressmen that have been coming out and saying we need to start immediate impeachment of Biden and the coup for violating the war powers and starting the bombing of Russia.
[00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.650]  In the last eight, nine days.
[00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.089]  That is completely insane.
[00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:35.609]  And Flynn last week, he was on the show, talked about emergency hearings in Congress that controls the purse and controls the power to declare war.
[00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:37.730]  To say, we know Biden's not in charge.
[00:29:37.829 --> 00:29:39.029]  We know Harris isn't in charge.
[00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.250]  We know it's Blinken at the State Department.
[00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.609]  We know it's the CIA. We know it's some of the nuts at the top of the Defense Department.
[00:29:49.369 --> 00:29:55.049]  Who came up with the plan to start bombing Russia with these missiles that can easily be fitted with nuclear weapons?
[00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:01.970]  And Russia said, if we see a bunch of these coming in, we have to consider them to be nuclear-tipped, and we'll have to have a nuclear response.
[00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:13.549]  And then now, administration officials are in the New York Times proposing giving them nuclear weapons, which is exactly what can be put on those attackums and storm shadows, and now the French missiles.
[00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.630]  France announced yesterday they're going to start bombing imminently.
[00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.509]  So there's that escalation.
[00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:28.349]  And they say in the New York Times article, we've already shown you some of the headlines, it's up on Infowars.com.
[00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:36.269]  They got it behind a paywall, but we posted it there for posterity because it's a major public interest.
[00:30:38.609 --> 00:30:45.450]  That they want to escalate this because they, quote, don't want to leave Ukraine in the lurch if Trump comes in.
[00:30:45.589 --> 00:30:52.529]  So they're stockpiling weapons and billions of dollars out of the State Department and Pentagon that is not earmarked for Ukraine illegally.
[00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:57.269]  Congress has the power of the purse, the power to declare war.
[00:30:57.569 --> 00:30:58.990]  The president then executes that.
[00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:00.289]  We don't have a real president.
[00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:05.230]  This is a global emergency, not just a national emergency.
[00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:10.640]  This is the greatest clear and present danger in modern military history.
[00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:24.400]  This is manifoldly, manifestly, exponentially more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis because we did not have completely incompetent lunatics in charge.
[00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:36.500]  Reuters AP have all reported for years, and they confirmed again last week, No one has talked to Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, or Vladimir Putin in years.
[00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:40.099]  Biden's want to talk to that guy, that punk.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.980]  Played the clip last week.
[00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:45.000]  Reporters, what about World War III, sir?
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.220]  Shut up, I told you not to talk.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.559]  Sit down and be quiet.
[00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:49.779]  I think it's his crazy look in his eye.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:57.289]  They probably did get that lunatic as the puppet president to go ahead and Sign on to this.
[00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.450]  Because he loves it.
[00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.569]  He loves the power.
[00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.809]  He loves toying with destruction.
[00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:03.630]  He's like a moth to fire.
[00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.849]  The Promethean flame of hydrogen hellfire.
[00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:17.730]  So, months ago they say, give him the missiles, but oh, we don't want the blame.
[00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.210]  Keir Starmer, all of them.
[00:32:20.869 --> 00:32:21.730]  I said, watch.
[00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:28.109]  As soon as Trump's president-elect, they'll start bombing Russia as an escalation so that they can escalate it out of control even if Trump does get in.
[00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:32.049]  And now they're in the New York Times saying just that today.
[00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.890]  This broke two hours ago.
[00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:38.630]  And people, well, that's mainstream media.
[00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.109]  I know it's true.
[00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.390]  No, no.
[00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:42.849]  When the New York Times acts as the mouth of the establishment, it's real.
[00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:49.170]  Just like two Sundays ago, It breaks.
[00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.450]  Biden greenlights, attack on missiles.
[00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:55.130]  Two days later, they start dropping.
[00:32:56.109 --> 00:32:58.369]  I said, I expect England to join.
[00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.150]  That follows the pattern.
[00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:01.829]  Next day, they start bombing.
[00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:03.950]  I said, next it'll be France.
[00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:06.109]  France announced yesterday they're going to start the bombing.
[00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.769]  Then I predict Poland's next.
[00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:09.890]  They're all getting up to the edge of the cliff.
[00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:10.549]  You go first.
[00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.230]  You go first.
[00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:14.269]  And what did Russia say?
[00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:21.970]  Years ago, you put in attackums and storm shadows up at our border and claim they're conventional.
[00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.690]  You can put hydrogen bombs on those in minutes.
[00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:30.309]  We consider that a secret sneak attack preparation.
[00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:44.529]  And now Putin said last week, if I see a large aerospace movement of aircraft and or missiles or both, not just, you know, five or ten getting shot at a time, we have to nuke NATO targets.
[00:33:45.349 --> 00:33:51.309]  We have to get our nukes off the ground, our aircraft off the ground, or we'll be caught in a sneak attack on the ground.
[00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.750]  That is US nuclear doctrine.
[00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.490]  That is Russian nuclear war doctrine.
[00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.250]  That is CHICOM nuclear doctrine.
[00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.589]  That is NATO nuclear doctrine.
[00:34:00.089 --> 00:34:13.650]  Do you think if 30 Russian submarines tomorrow popped up 12 miles off our coast and started firing missiles, that the Pentagon's going to wait and see if those have got hydrogen bombs on them?
[00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.559]  You take it as a nuclear sneak attack.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:30.260]  By default, when a bunch of missiles start coming in, phone call gets made, the president meets for a few minutes, they're in tracking, total release, nuclear war.
[00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.139]  You don't just take out the submarines, you don't just try to shoot down the missiles.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.280]  Because you know cruise missiles are coming in.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.500]  You know ICBMs are getting launched.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.219]  You know the nuclear bombers are inbound.
[00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.809]  And it comes in waves.
[00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:54.469]  And the world and the surface of the planet will be destroyed.
[00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:57.530]  Just like that.
[00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:06.409]  They have a nuclear war, World War III, howitzer to our head.
[00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.389]  They don't have a shotgun.
[00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:10.050]  They don't have an AR-15.
[00:35:10.469 --> 00:35:11.869]  They don't have a...
[00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:29.449]  338 Lapu at our head, they have a giant nuclear cannon that's so big, it's like we're crawling into the end of it to get splattered across the universe.
[00:35:38.989 --> 00:35:55.230]  So, eight years ago, more than eight years ago now, a little more than eight years ago, on the eve of the election, one week before, we put out an emergency campaign ad for Trump in 2016 saying, vote November 8th like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:57.730]  Because Hillary said, I will go to war with Iran.
[00:35:57.909 --> 00:35:59.369]  I will go to war with Russia.
[00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:01.530]  If there's a cyber attack, we'll nuke them.
[00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.710]  And that's policy today.
[00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:06.909]  Well, look at Vault 7 and the CIA Snowden documents.
[00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.789]  The CIA all the time is running attacks out of other countries and blaming people.
[00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:18.050]  My God, I've had the deep state plant porn on our computers that we never opened and try to put us in jail for it.
[00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:22.670]  The FBI wasn't totally corrupt and said, no, Infowars and Alex Jones are the victims of this.
[00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:25.289]  But do you think they're just planting stuff on us?
[00:36:30.469 --> 00:36:31.710]  So we're in a war.
[00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:32.969]  It's not a proxy war.
[00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.670]  It's not a shadow war.
[00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:35.750]  It's not a hybrid war.
[00:36:35.949 --> 00:36:38.469]  It's a war, a conventional war with Russia.
[00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.849]  I told you last Wednesday, I said within 48 hours, you'll start hearing the announcement.
[00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:50.590]  And now you have NATO and the former head of the Ukrainian military and the Hill newspaper.
[00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:52.289]  Yep, World War III has begun.
[00:36:54.489 --> 00:36:56.570]  I don't write these headlines to be sensational.
[00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.469]  I think about it.
[00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.090]  I look at history.
[00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:58.789]  I look at the doctrine.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:07.119]  We were the first to announce at 1045 Central that Trump was the winner on election night.
[00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:10.960]  General Flynn came on the morning and said he was going to win.
[00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:12.000]  But we knew.
[00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:13.599]  People said, well, how are you announcing?
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.579]  It's supposed to be CNN. No, we announce things when we see it's clear.
[00:37:22.119 --> 00:37:23.960]  We don't let them write the talking points.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.460]  Just because they tell us two men can have a baby and there's no X and Y chromosomes, we don't listen to that.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.519]  We set the agenda.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.639]  We, the people.
[00:37:34.659 --> 00:37:42.699]  And we're not some central Borg where the globalist and BlackRock and the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA come out with some idea and then permeate it throughout society.
[00:37:43.659 --> 00:37:48.840]  General Flynn, Alex Jones, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson.
[00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:51.590]  We do research.
[00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.329]  We inspire each other.
[00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:55.530]  We talk to the other experts.
[00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.989]  We have an open college of public discussion with the facts.
[00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.710]  And when I tell you that we are in World War III, we are in the beginning stages of it.
[00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:13.670]  And when I tell you that it rapidly goes in almost every war game scenario to total nuclear war, that is a fact that's not even debated.
[00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.429]  So what can you do about it?
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.960]  General Flynn will be here in 15 minutes to talk about it.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.039]  In studio, sitting right there.
[00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:37.820]  You can take the live feeds from Real Alex Jones right now and at AJN, Alex Jones Network, at AJN Live and at Infowars on X, and you can repost it on X and say...
[00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:45.429]  The Biden administration is openly proposing, floating the idea, testing the water for what they want to do.
[00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:53.809]  I told you, they will bomb Russia with these missiles when they tested it two months ago in the New York Times, and then again two weeks ago, and then it started.
[00:38:54.150 --> 00:39:00.650]  They're not just proposing it like it's a scenario they're discussing.
[00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:08.070]  They're saying it because they want to get the rest of the system online, and they've already had the Lindsey Graham's.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:21.539]  And others up there, hell, the Speaker of the House, saying, yeah, let's give those bombs, let's give those missiles to Ukraine to attack Russia.
[00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:30.400]  So they're trying to normalize this and have a sleepwalk into nuclear Armageddon.
[00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.300]  So I'm going to say it again very slowly.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.000]  They have a nuclear gun to our head.
[00:39:35.809 --> 00:40:06.039]  They'd rather have a nuclear war they believe they'll emerge in control of the planet on the other side of and they want to say Ukraine was invaded so we gave them nukes and then whatever happened we're not sure do a nuclear false flag blame Russia so they can emerge as the group that was the good guys and attacked first they're trying to get Russia and China to strike first They would rather burn the world down than lose
[00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:06.400]  power.
[00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:11.900]  They got a choice, go to prison or start World War III, nuclear war.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.820]  And you're a normal person.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:22.340]  You just like to go to church and work and your kids and your life and grandma and grandkids and you just want to, you know, you're normal, you don't want power.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:31.920]  Well, you need to understand history that you look at history and the tyrannies are more common than freedom-loving countries.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:41.659]  And we have the nastiest, most disgusting case of satanic pedophile scum, transhumanist death cult trash.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.400]  In charge, there's been a global awakening, thanks to this audience of activists.
[00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:49.119]  You're at the core of the resistance.
[00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.619]  You're recognized as that.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.920]  And so humanity's coming back from the dead, awakening, rising like the phoenix.
[00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:03.159]  And the power structure is we'll just release new viruses and start massive wars and get race wars going.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:11.199]  And those are all the different ingredients, the different crises they've got cooked up and rolling out right now.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.460]  But people are ahead of it now.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.539]  When Democrat leaders say we're going to resist the ICE people and we're going to call out the citizens and have a civil war.
[00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:24.280]  And now those different Democrats, like the mayor of Denver, are like, oh, actually, that was illegal.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.000]  I was just joking.
[00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:25.559]  Don't do that.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:31.019]  Because people are putting heat on him, saying, we don't know how this is going to end, but you're going to be held responsible, buddy.
[00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:36.960]  You want to play general and tell the public to go out and start attacking the feds in a constitutional duty?
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.659]  You are the one involved in insurrection.
[00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:42.440]  You are the one that wants to play soldier.
[00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:46.980]  And let me tell you, soldier boy, this thing kicks off to a real civil war.
[00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:48.300]  You're going to be held accountable.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.420]  You understand that?
[00:41:50.639 --> 00:41:52.099]  You know what the penalty of that is?
[00:41:52.219 --> 00:42:05.940]  Once you're tried by a jury of your peers, you trigger a civil war and a bunch of dead people and riots all over this country, you'll be lucky if you just spend the rest of your life in a supermax prison and not at the end of a rope!
[00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:15.219]  So, we have entered the wheelhouse of Armageddon.
[00:42:22.089 --> 00:42:37.789]  Now, my phone's blown off the wall in the last week with other talk show hosts and other people and even some of my own crew, though they love Trump, but behind him, going, oh, well, these appointments are good, but the Surgeon General's a big pharma idiot and blah,
[00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:39.349]  blah, blah, and oh my God, Trump's gonna...
[00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.929]  Trump's not going to make all perfect appointments.
[00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.650]  It's his policies that matter.
[00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:47.690]  He's ten times more awake and hardcore than he was.
[00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.750]  We haven't got him in office yet.
[00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:54.650]  The globalists are trying to start World War III and they're cooking up new viruses and the bird flu hysteria.
[00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:03.449]  We need to be all hands on deck to expose and stop World War III. We need to be all hands on deck to protect President Trump.
[00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:14.570]  And then once he gets into office and once we dial back The military escalations and get the border under control and get energy flowing again.
[00:43:15.929 --> 00:43:20.570]  I will guarantee you he'll end up removing some of these people that...
[00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.269]  Because, look, Trump's really smart, but he's also compulsive.
[00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.570]  And I know how the sausage gets made, okay?
[00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.590]  And so he gets told by people he likes us as a good person.
[00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.250]  He's just going, bloop, [...] picking these people.
[00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:33.690]  Some are good, some are bad.
[00:43:35.239 --> 00:43:50.920]  The point is, is that we're spending more time as an awake patriot population bitching and complaining about what's going on around Trump instead of the elephant in the room.
[00:43:53.099 --> 00:43:59.880]  So, we need main focus on stopping nuclear war, and then the border, getting energy...
[00:44:01.019 --> 00:44:02.699]  Down, stopping inflation.
[00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:06.099]  Trump's announced he's banning transgenders from the military.
[00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:14.780]  Trump's banning federal funds to all the woke crap.
[00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:20.780]  So, I know everybody wants to be holier than thou and purists and all this stuff.
[00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:36.469]  But if you haven't been in charge of something, which most people haven't been in charge of a lot of people, If my crew wasn't fully behind me and doing a great job, we couldn't even operate, and they're all loyal and the best crew I've ever had.
[00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:39.309]  And I got a crew of like 45 people.
[00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:53.219]  Trump has tens of thousands of executives under him, millions of people that take orders from him, And some of these people have worked for the globalists.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.800]  Now they've sworn allegiance to America.
[00:44:55.139 --> 00:44:56.800]  A lot of that's going to turn out to be real.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.579]  A lot of it isn't.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.599]  Some people are total patriots.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.780]  The globalists are going after them.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.980]  Those issues will be dealt with.
[00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:10.500]  But you don't want to wake up next week and they say the Iranians have shot down his airplane with a surface air missile and we're at war with Iran.
[00:45:10.699 --> 00:45:11.840]  You know it's going to be the deep state.
[00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:18.800]  You don't want to wake up next week getting blown out of your bed when the ceiling falls on you because a hydrogen bomb detonated 10 miles away.
[00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:27.079]  You, in my view, need to be praying and politically engaged on the big issues.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.980]  Because the ship's sinking right now.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.079]  Trump is not the captain yet.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:42.280]  And he's got behind-the-scenes detente going on and trying to get Putin to come out and propose a ceasefire to put it on Zelensky, who said he won't.
[00:45:45.539 --> 00:45:47.019]  So, I'm going to say it again.
[00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:52.510]  The globalists are in the New York Times saying, we want to hand Trump a disaster.
[00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.289]  We want to make sure this war doesn't end.
[00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:58.590]  We want to not leave the poor Ukrainians behind with their dictator Zelensky.
[00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:02.730]  We want to escalate this.
[00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.889]  We're looking at giving him nuclear weapons.
[00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.230]  And a few months ago, we're looking at giving him the missiles that deliver the weapons.
[00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:12.190]  And the Russians said, we know you're going to give him the missiles first, the nukes next.
[00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.590]  And Zelensky was begging for the nukes.
[00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:20.949]  And major diplomats told Build in October that the word was they were going to get nukes.
[00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:32.789]  They probably wouldn't give them the missiles, even the nukes, much less the nukes, if Trump wouldn't have been elected.
[00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:38.489]  But when he got elected, that pushed the globalists into crisis mode to hold us all hostage.
[00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.809]  So...
[00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:52.789]  I'm not spending a lot of time on it coming out in court documents that Michael Bloomberg has been behind to the fake lawsuits against me with his National Gun Control Group and the PR firms and the rigged court cases and the fake auction.
[00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:53.670]  That's important.
[00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.190]  That's a big deal.
[00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.250]  But it's not compared to nuclear war.
[00:46:59.369 --> 00:47:01.250]  Yeah, it's trending the top of everywhere.
[00:47:01.469 --> 00:47:03.210]  Elon Musk talks about buying InfoWars.
[00:47:03.369 --> 00:47:04.210]  Okay, great.
[00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.349]  That raises my profile.
[00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:11.250]  I only see that as useful to get people to understand how much danger we're in from nuclear war.
[00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:12.510]  Okay?
[00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:16.630]  So, we need priorities here, in my view.
[00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:28.130]  And I don't think anybody can debate me that the main priority is stopping nuclear war and getting President Trump into office and keeping him alive.
[00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.650]  Because he does mean well.
[00:47:30.789 --> 00:47:31.670]  He is a patriot.
[00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.969]  He's not out to get you.
[00:47:34.269 --> 00:47:38.190]  He's got a coalition of rebels and mavericks who are conservative, who are liberal.
[00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.769]  That's how you build a coalition.
[00:47:41.489 --> 00:47:45.170]  And if any of those people go sideways, he'll remove them just like that.
[00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:48.409]  But...
[00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:54.570]  Text messages, emails, phone calls, blowing me up.
[00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.269]  Talk about the Surgeon General.
[00:47:56.469 --> 00:47:57.510]  Talk about the...
[00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.010]  Yeah, the woman's an idiot.
[00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.909]  Wants to ban tobacco.
[00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:01.670]  Uh...
[00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:03.519]  Wants to make you take shots.
[00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:05.300]  Wants to make kids wear masks.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.000]  She's a kookball.
[00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:08.019]  Okay, Trump got bad advice.
[00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:08.280]  Whatever.
[00:48:08.579 --> 00:48:10.820]  He'll be in charge of policy and we'll cross that bridge.
[00:48:12.239 --> 00:48:16.079]  But that isn't even on my radar screen right now.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.420]  Exposing them wanting to bring back a new pandemic.
[00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:21.820]  That is.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.119]  And we're exposing it.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.360]  So we got to triage things.
[00:48:25.719 --> 00:48:30.840]  And triage is a medical military term for those that don't know.
[00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:45.769]  Whereas a 2,000 pound bomb gets dropped in the middle of a town and obviously someone whose head's completely blown off or someone that's blown in two and obviously dead, you don't go check on them.
[00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:56.670]  And then next you see people that are badly injured but that you can save and you've got to then figure out, okay, who's the most injured I can still save versus who is the least injured, they can wait.
[00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:04.400]  So the dead can wait to be buried and the people that are just Wounded but not grievously, they can wait.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.019]  Who is the most hurt that you can save?
[00:49:07.139 --> 00:49:10.619]  Okay, so I'm doing the same thing here politically.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.519]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:49:12.639 --> 00:49:13.599]  Now, there's a paradox here.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.639]  I get so focused on stopping this that I think we will stop it.
[00:49:18.679 --> 00:49:20.019]  I don't want to believe my kids are all about to die.
[00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:21.480]  I don't want to believe we're actually about to have nuclear war.
[00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:23.440]  But if we don't admit it's a threat, it could happen.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.619]  And it's becoming a probability on the current path.
[00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.510]  But if I don't focus on our own issues here at Infowars, we'll get shut down.
[00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.489]  There's a hearing today, status conference.
[00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.909]  The judge says he's not going to probably rule today on Infowars' future.
[00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.309]  He wants a full evidentiary hearing, and he is pissed.
[00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:39.989]  That's at 2 p.m.
[00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:40.190]  today.
[00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:42.750]  Regardless, I need money.
[00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:49.969]  I'm suing the Democrat Party and their conglomerate that tried to falsely get the company.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.599]  We have got a very strong case.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.159]  My lawyers think that there's really, it's hard that we don't win, but we've got to depose these people and go after them.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.599]  I got a bunch of other lawsuits against these people, and that's gearing up towards conspiracy to violate rights, criminal stuff.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.239]  Because this is real organized conspiracy against the First Amendment, against yours truly, and against your right to hear this information.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.659]  But the main reason is we need to keep this broadcast on air.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.300]  Even if this gets shut down, the Oxhills Network stands ready.
[00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:21.909]  But it takes funds to do that.
[00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.090]  So we make it easy.
[00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:26.969]  The AlexJonesStore.com is not owned by InfoWars, not owned by me.
[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:27.710]  It's a huge sponsor.
[00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:31.809]  So even if the bad guys take this over, that won't be taken over.
[00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:36.769]  That will be the new ship, the main new sponsor.
[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:43.889]  Incredible supplements, incredible Patriot gear, limited edition posters that are fundraisers.
[00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.329]  So you have a memento that you supported at a key time.
[00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:47.309]  That's why they're marked up.
[00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.329]  You get a great deal on the supplements and patron apparel.
[00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:55.230]  I need you to take action, plus they're great products, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:29.889]  It's amazing.
[00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:30.750]  The Hydroforce.
[00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:32.769]  It's all the vitamins and minerals and electrolytes.

[00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:42.000]  And other special offers and discounts.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.619]  So many other great products at thealexjohnstore.com.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.880]  We can't do it without you.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.159]  I want to thank all those who have supported and tell those that haven't.
[00:51:51.239 --> 00:51:51.900]  We're fighting for you.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.659]  Please fight for us.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:08.239]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:13.780]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public and people can just put in one bid.
[00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.650]  And then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:22.010]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.650]  Who knows?
[00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.630]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:40.289]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.679]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:57.440]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com with incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.099]  Where we won't miss a beat.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:13.880]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge Pickup Giveaway Sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at TheOlicanStore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:21.619]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in, but that's going to get announced the winner here in just a few days.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:29.300]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, The Alex Jones Network will be on air, and so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[00:53:29.519 --> 00:53:38.480]  So now, we're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour Giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:44.380]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:45.860]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[00:53:46.019 --> 00:53:47.000]  It's a beautiful truck.
[00:53:47.559 --> 00:53:52.920]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[00:53:53.119 --> 00:53:55.880]  And there's so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.

[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.289]  And here is the amazing new offer.
[00:54:38.449 --> 00:54:42.829]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.

[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.139]  It's so exciting to see the big win with Trump.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.780]  Now we've got to stay on air to back his agenda to make America great again and go after the deep state globalists.
[00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:47.940]  God bless you all.
[00:55:48.159 --> 00:55:49.119]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.159]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:52.989 --> 00:56:00.409]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:08.630]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:11.030]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:16.510]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:22.349]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.489]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:28.750]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:31.630]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:39.800]  With her, you'll end up in World War III. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:47.900]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:56:49.739 --> 00:57:01.820]  The US military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:57:02.179 --> 00:57:04.679]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.880]  Of course not, because she's- Really loud noise.
[00:57:10.519 --> 00:57:13.340]  All right, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:57:13.519 --> 00:57:15.619]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.840]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:57:50.889 --> 00:58:06.289]  I am very concerned that the people who have hated Trump for eight years and run out of ways to destroy him Indicting him, first calling him a racist, spying on him with the federal intel agencies, sicking the FBI on him,
[00:58:06.409 --> 00:58:13.489]  trying to put him in prison, then trying to kill him at least twice, probably more, actually, but at least twice.
[00:58:13.869 --> 00:58:28.670]  And that those people, out of options, have decided the only way to stop Trump and the disclosure that a Trump administration will bring, once again, disclosure is what they fear, having their crimes revealed, that the only way to stop Trump is with a world war.
[00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:34.849]  And so I've been pretty fixated on that for months, probably more than a year.
[00:58:34.969 --> 00:58:37.329]  I've just thought a lot about it, and I know a lot of the people involved.
[00:58:37.329 --> 00:58:40.190]  And they're very, very, very focused on war.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:46.699]  Permanent Washington doesn't care about domestic policy, in case your viewers, I'm sure, know this, but just want to restate it.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.940]  They don't care about domestic policy.
[00:58:49.139 --> 00:58:56.619]  They don't care about fixing the country, closing the borders, ending the drug crisis, getting the cartels out of, you know, the entire Southwest.
[00:58:57.139 --> 00:58:58.199]  They don't care about that.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:04.360]  What they care about is exercising power abroad, killing people because it makes them feel like God, and making money.
[00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:06.420]  And that's where the money is, trillions of dollars.
[00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:08.239]  So they care about foreign policy.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:25.480]  And I've been concerned and remain concerned that that group of people, which is basically everyone in DC in both parties, wants Trump to take the country to war, either against Russia or, far more likely,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.639]  Iran.
[00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:34.429]  And I think what people outside I don't know how to the degree to which this is understood, but I just will say it.
[00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:36.670]  A war with Iran is a world war.
[00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:46.730]  This is not 2002. Iran is now part of a coalition that includes the biggest economies in the world and the largest militaries in the world.
[00:59:47.219 --> 00:59:57.440]  So a war with Iran means a war in effect or, you know, by proxy, but still a war with Russia, China, Turkey, and a lot of the rest of the world.
[00:59:57.579 --> 00:59:58.900]  So that's a world war.
[00:59:59.059 --> 01:00:02.159]  It's not just as simple as we're going to take out their nuclear facilities.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.219]  Okay, how are you going to do that?
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.159]  And how are you going to ensure that that doesn't destroy the United States in the process?
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.619]  And of course, they don't care whether it destroys the United States.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.900]  That's the actual answer.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.519]  They don't care.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.139]  And if they cared, they would pause and think about it.
[01:00:17.219 --> 01:00:19.179]  But anyway, I don't want to be bitter about it.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.000]  But to me, it's really simple.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:21.619]  Anybody...
[01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:33.050]  We're good to go.
[01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:45.880]  But there's really no debate at this point about the debacle that has been Ukraine.
[01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:46.760]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.199]  Stay with us.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.480]  It's just completely destroyed.
[01:00:48.619 --> 01:00:53.659]  We are now into hour number two of this Monday, November 25th, 2024 broadcast.
[01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:56.280]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you.
[01:00:57.139 --> 01:01:02.460]  From the embattled Infowar studios in Austin, Texas, and General Flynn...
[01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:14.889]  We're good to go.
[01:01:30.949 --> 01:01:43.010]  And that, of course, is the New York Times announcement that senior administration officials, this was an announcement just like a week and a half ago through the New York Times, that Biden authorized the bombing of Russia with attack of missiles, which then two days later began.
[01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.530]  Then England, now France, is announcing it.
[01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:52.070]  England's already bombed the UK. They've formed this new northern group, even if Trump gets NATO to back down.
[01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.929]  This new northern group led by the UK and Germany.
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:59.070]  And Poland says they're going to continue the war.
[01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.489]  And in the New York Times article, just for new listeners joining us, I covered it last hour.
[01:02:04.039 --> 01:02:05.940]  They're saying, well, we can't just let Trump have peace.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.059]  We've got to escalate this and give Ukraine nuclear weapons.
[01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:12.800]  So they are floating that.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.820]  They are proposing that, just like they did in the last few months, giving them the attackums and storm shadows.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.579]  They've done that.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:24.980]  So they are seriously trying to bring the world to the verge of a hot war.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.199]  And I was just talking to General Flynn before we went live.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.139]  He's about to exclusively.
[01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.320]  This is what he does for a living.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.059]  Top expert.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:50.239]  On the deep state, and he said there was a good chance they would try civil unrest and crisis and martial law, but I'm not putting words in your mouth, but you said now it looks like that is where they're going, so we're about to lay out real-time scenarios with the globalists that are so desperate,
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.519]  they either go to prison or they start...
[01:03:06.639 --> 01:03:10.460]  Thank you for coming here to Austin, Texas, just for our broadcast, sir.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:15.429]  I'm going to try to, as best I can now, Really, for most of the hour, give you the floor.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:16.289]  Then I've got a lot of questions.
[01:03:16.449 --> 01:03:20.710]  And also, we're going to post a link on X for people's questions to you.
[01:03:21.469 --> 01:03:26.510]  In fact, we should launch an X Spaces and take some questions or comments next hour.
[01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:27.409]  We'll do that as well.
[01:03:27.489 --> 01:03:28.250]  But General Flynn, thank you.
[01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:29.510]  Yeah, I would really like to.
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.070]  I'd love to do that, especially get questions.
[01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:33.070]  I think there's a lot of questions out there right now.
[01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:40.750]  So when all this began, you know, with the exchange of these weapons systems, right?
[01:03:40.889 --> 01:03:46.829]  This firing, you know, the allowance of the ATACMS to shoot across the border and all this sort of thing, right?
[01:03:46.929 --> 01:03:49.630]  These are events that all occurred.
[01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:53.989]  And you have to look at these, you know, in the so what.
[01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:58.590]  And so I took, and I've been talking about this for a long, long time, actually.
[01:03:59.349 --> 01:04:00.969]  Months, if not years.
[01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:07.610]  And I will just remind people that the original war, the regional war in Ukraine...
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:14.800]  Started in February of 2014. So that was during the Obama administration.
[01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:20.519]  Of course, Trump was able to kind of keep things in check just because of his great leadership.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:27.400]  And then, of course, when Biden came in in 2020 or after in 2021, then we started to build back up.
[01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:29.679]  And this is where we're at right now.
[01:04:29.679 --> 01:04:33.000]  So we had this monumental victory.
[01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:40.789]  Where President Trump won a huge, huge victory here and a mandate, they call it, I guess.
[01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:46.190]  So the last couple of days I've been going through what I do, right?
[01:04:46.289 --> 01:04:51.670]  And what I do for a living is one of the things that I do is I look at scenarios that can play out and I lay them out.
[01:04:51.949 --> 01:04:55.150]  And I actually wrote a document the other day.
[01:04:55.639 --> 01:04:57.880]  And I, you know, like Alex has got his stuff here.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:05.960]  I kind of went through the last probably four or five months of news articles that I do, you know, research that I do and things that I look at.
[01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:09.059]  And many of this, much of this stuff is starting to play out.
[01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:13.079]  You know, one of the scenarios that I'll, and I'm going to just tick these off real quick.
[01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:15.429]  I put out five the other day.
[01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:19.530]  One is the continued assassination of President Donald J. Trump.
[01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.690]  I still firmly believe that that is on the table.
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:37.530]  I do not think for a second that that conversation has been taken off by these people that want to get us involved in essentially a military-industrial complex, sleepwalking, whatever you want to call it, war,
[01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:42.440]  World War III. So the second scenario is really this idea of conventional resistance.
[01:05:42.679 --> 01:05:55.880]  And conventional resistance is really where, you know, it's just to try to create the conditions where there's no coming back and you have this conventional march to essentially what would be turned from a regional war to a world war.
[01:05:56.219 --> 01:06:26.440]  One of the things, and it is breaking today, the United Kingdom and France We've seen that in the summer of 2020.
[01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:27.960]  We've seen that with Antifa.
[01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:30.679]  We've seen that in the streets of America over many years.
[01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:33.199]  Many, many, you know, years, really.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.179]  I mean, they just go to violent resistance in the streets and they try to draw us into something, right?
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.500]  The fourth scenario is provoking war, which is really where I think we're at right now.
[01:06:42.739 --> 01:06:48.039]  And then the fifth scenario, and this is all, you can find this at GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:06:48.159 --> 01:06:52.460]  The fifth scenario is the false flag war, false flag war.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.980]  And I actually think that there's a combination of all of them.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.820]  So here's where I believe we're at, and I thought about this overnight.
[01:07:00.519 --> 01:07:05.920]  As I was coming out here to meet with Alex and to sit down with you and your great audience.
[01:07:06.699 --> 01:07:08.500]  So what might happen?
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:24.710]  I believe sitting here today, because number one, these people want to cause Donald Trump's agenda, which is principally domestic and economic, to completely collapse before he's even able to take office on inauguration day.
[01:07:24.869 --> 01:07:28.210]  I firmly, firmly believe that.
[01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:32.150]  I mean, the whole thing about getting rid of the illegals, the deportation campaign.
[01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:37.079]  You know, his reemergence of the energy sector in this country, all the kinds of things that he wants to do.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.099]  These people want to, they want nothing to do with that.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:55.539]  They want to continue in their sort of seats of power and this money-making machine that they have, not only in the US military industrial complex, but also the global military industrial complex, which is a huge, huge, I mean, a trillion,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:02.599]  multi-trillion dollar We're good to go.
[01:08:02.599 --> 01:08:12.300]  We're good to go.
[01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:23.829]  So all that said about Trump, all that said about Ukraine and NATO and all, I actually think that these people are gonna, they're gonna take a hard look at how can they get rid of Biden.
[01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:28.289]  And I wrote about this a couple of weeks back about the 25th Amendment.
[01:08:28.449 --> 01:08:33.960]  If it's not the 25th Amendment, then we should In fact, I think I came on your show and we talked about the impeachment process.
[01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:40.600]  There was, I think Congressman Self is one of them out of Texas, I believe, that put up impeachment proceedings.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.979]  Of course, Congress goes on Thanksgiving recess and we've seen nothing, right?
[01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:48.420]  I mean, we are marching toward war here.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.140]  And Alex, you've used the phrase sleepwalking toward war.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:09:01.189]  We are sleepwalking toward World War III. So I think that one of the things that they're contemplating is taking Biden out.
[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.970]  That then puts Harris in.
[01:09:04.409 --> 01:09:09.229]  And whoever they make the vice president, and they can choose anybody.
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:14.670]  Kamala Harris at that point in time, she can appoint anybody in the country to be the vice president.
[01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:22.840]  Then I think what they're going to do is they're going to contemplate They're, you know, additional sort of subset scenarios, okay?
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.979]  And what are they?
[01:09:24.079 --> 01:09:24.800]  What might they be?
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.300]  Well, one might be a declaration of martial law.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Another might be a implementation of a national security emergency order.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:43.020]  And I can tell you that there's, and I wrote about this quite a while ago, probably four or five months ago, there are 43 of them.
[01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.399]  And I put this out on, you know, I wrote an article.
[01:09:46.739 --> 01:09:51.119]  It was the second of two-part article called Their Plans for Us.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.279]  You can find it at GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.579]  And the subtitle is A State of Emergency.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.060]  There are 43 states...
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:07.060]  There are 43 national emergency orders that can be implemented by the President of the United States.
[01:10:07.239 --> 01:10:18.239]  You know, and not all of them deal with what we're talking about here specifically, but many of them deal with overseas scenarios, things that might happen if this, then that.
[01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:23.569]  And these are things that the President of the United States, many of these actually go back to the 60s.
[01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:25.449]  And they're still on the books.
[01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:30.489]  If one of them is initiated, it kicks in about 150 different laws.
[01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:32.470]  It sort of opens up the door, if you will.
[01:10:32.569 --> 01:10:35.529]  It opens up another Pandora's box, if you will.
[01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:41.510]  So we have this situation where if this happens, so again, this is a scenario.
[01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:44.689]  It is not an unlikely scenario.
[01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:48.050]  People will say all kinds of crazy things.
[01:10:48.699 --> 01:11:02.640]  So what I'm saying is that if they want to continue down this path, and I firmly believe that they want to continue down this path to draw us into a much greater world war, World War III. We're already in the throes of it.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.319]  We've seen all the back and forth these last couple weeks.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.239]  The only people that are really covering it, honestly, and covering it...
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.760]  Honestly and covering it is right here, Alex Jones.
[01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:24.180]  And there have been a few others out there, but I think, I flipped around the last couple of days and I got up early this morning to just kind of complete my research.
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:30.039]  And I'm going through all the different sort, I call them the opposition networks, the enemy networks, right?
[01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:38.710]  I mean, all the big ABC, CBS, NBC. I went through MSNBC, CNN, Fox, and a couple others to see what they were talking about.
[01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.550]  None of them are even talking about any of this stuff.
[01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:46.609]  I mean, this is such a dangerous situation that we are involved in.
[01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:53.060]  The other thing that I started to look at Because I started to look at alliances, the various alliances that we have.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:12:00.500]  And one of the things that I'd done probably years ago was I did an entire roadmap of China.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:08.039]  And how is China building up itself to essentially be the great power of the 21st century?
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.260]  And remember, we're already in the third decade of the 21st century.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.520]  So how does China...
[01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:25.250]  Relate to what is going on in this essentially regional war of Eastern Europe, which has now turned into World War III. And this is no kidding.
[01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:40.579]  Whether it's a new alliance that's formed with this northern group out of Europe, or whether it's this funny relationship that's now developed between the United Kingdom and France, who are coming out with a lot of rhetoric about Very offensive, provocative rhetoric.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:52.680]  I mean, all these types of things that are going on, the exchange of these missiles, I mean, the ATACMS, the ICBM, IRBM, it doesn't matter, they're all nuclear capable.
[01:12:53.250 --> 01:13:01.130]  The types of mines that they're allowing to put on the battlefield, we've restricted those forever.
[01:13:01.489 --> 01:13:07.510]  So, there are actions being taken, and you have to wonder, who the hell is in charge?
[01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:09.029]  I mean, where are these people?
[01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:19.810]  I mean, we've joked about Biden being lost in the forest down there in South America, Kamala Harris on leave, I think, out in Hawaii, or on vacation out in Hawaii.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.079]  What might happen over these next couple of days?
[01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:39.119]  I think we're going to see additional provocations, and I mean extreme provocations, does not appear like Zelensky wants to sit down or have any kind of reasonable conversation about any of the peaceful proposals that are on the table right now.
[01:13:39.319 --> 01:13:53.399]  I do believe, in fact, we know it, and I think you've talked about it, there is zero, I mean zero communications between The United States government and the Russian government right now, Putin and Biden.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.779]  I mean, there has been no conversations.
[01:13:56.079 --> 01:13:58.199]  I used to work in the Pentagon.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.979]  One of the jobs that I had, I was the senior intelligence officer in the Pentagon and the joint staff.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:11.989]  And one of the responsibilities that we had was that there was an area downstairs in the Pentagon where we used to Run these various exercises.
[01:14:12.409 --> 01:14:21.369]  And one of the places that I have been, and we actually did have to execute it at one time, we had to use it one time, was the hotline.
[01:14:21.609 --> 01:14:30.510]  And when we went to use the hotline, it was between my boss at the time, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his counterpart in Russia, to be able to speak to each other.
[01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:36.069]  We did it up through various means, and they were able to communicate when certain things were happening.
[01:14:36.489 --> 01:14:46.079]  And I wanna, again, We are trying to, and we've done a marvelous job of pushing Russia into the embrace of China.
[01:14:46.479 --> 01:14:55.640]  And China, that's why I talked about China and this whole initiative of China that they have had for years now.
[01:14:55.859 --> 01:15:03.539]  And this goes back, God, this goes back probably to the turn of the century here, this last, so it goes back 20, 25 years.
[01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:14.289]  And actually, earlier, when you start to think about their planning to get to where we are today, so China sees itself as the global superpower for this century.
[01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:19.130]  And they're marching in that, and they're marching very steadily, right?
[01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:26.670]  And they're moving along, and they're sticking to their plan, and they are going to try to achieve a set of alliances.
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:42.390]  I mean, just to give you an example, I think the one-belt One Road Initiative of China, which has everything to do with what we're talking about in Ukraine, has everything to do with keeping this power structure going,
[01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:47.350]  making the money that they need to make, changing the dynamics of the world that they want to change.
[01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:54.210]  They being these globalists out of the World Economic Forum and out of some of these other globalist organizations.
[01:15:54.210 --> 01:16:04.210]  And there are People that are running countries right now, like Macron out of France, Cairns out of the United Kingdom, Trudeau out of Canada as examples.
[01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:16.010]  So you have about 130 to 140 nations on the planet that represents about 75% of the world's population.
[01:16:16.689 --> 01:16:21.149]  China has some type of relationship or access.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.979]  Into that many nations of the planet right now.
[01:16:25.159 --> 01:16:27.920]  That's been going on for almost 20 years.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:35.539]  And we have not stunted that at all because we've had globalists after globalists after globalists inside of our government.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.619]  The government that is That Trump is now trying to take apart, right?
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.420]  And they're gonna have a very, very difficult time.
[01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:51.739]  I applaud everything that Elon is doing, that Vivek is doing, and that Trump wants to achieve.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.800]  But I can tell you, I have great access still inside the government to people inside the Department of Defense, people inside the intelligence community.
[01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:17.949]  And there's good people in there, but I'm going to tell you, they are already saying that the folks coming in, whether it's Ratcliffe over at the CIA or Tulsi up at DNI, that's the intel community sort of big blockers and tacklers,
[01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:21.369]  or Hegseth, if he can get through confirmation at the Department of Defense.
[01:17:21.529 --> 01:17:27.310]  Most people don't know, Alex, and for your audience, but the largest intelligence component...
[01:17:27.729 --> 01:17:32.510]  In the United States government is the Defense Department, okay?
[01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:41.010]  The Defense Department has, when you look at it in totality, it has most of the intelligence resources for the country.
[01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:47.470]  You have, of course, your CIA and you have other outside or other external to the Department of Defense.
[01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:50.250]  It's all that.
[01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:55.949]  And, you know, you're talking about all the four services have huge, you know, particularly the Army, huge intelligence components.
[01:17:56.090 --> 01:18:02.289]  You've got the Defense Intelligence Agency, you have the National Security Agency, you have the National Geospatial Agency, you have the National Reconnaissance Office.
[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.569]  I mean, these are giant chunks.
[01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:06.539]  Right, of the Defense Department.
[01:18:06.819 --> 01:18:10.539]  And we have a Secretary of Defense right now.
[01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:20.640]  I haven't seen hard nor hair of any statements, anything coming out of there other than provocative and provocations that we- What did you make of Austin, the Secretary of Defense?
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.560]  Saying it's a bluff.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:43.380]  I mean, the Russians didn't bluff when they took over Crimea in 2014 or 2016. They weren't bluffing three years ago when they invaded, and they weren't bluffing when they fired that intermediate-range ballistic missile that Putin said was a test of a successful nuclear weapon delivery system evading anti-missile systems.
[01:18:43.659 --> 01:18:48.119]  Yeah, so that was one of the scenarios I talked about was this idea of conventional resistance.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.340]  And so that is incorrect thinking, okay?
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.239]  Because there's this very misunderstood concept of deterrence, right?
[01:18:59.399 --> 01:18:59.939]  Deterrence.
[01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:04.699]  And deterrence has always been because of mutual assured destruction, right?
[01:19:04.859 --> 01:19:05.380]  Mad, right?
[01:19:05.439 --> 01:19:06.079]  It's crazy, right?
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.680]  But mutual assured destruction and deterrence.
[01:19:08.979 --> 01:19:11.140]  Deterrence is something that is misunderstood.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.220]  People will say, well, it's worked for a long time.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:30.760]  But what we just witnessed was the firing of nuclear-capable weapon systems that the United States government allowed, gave to and allowed, and then had to have given the capability to be able to launch those to hit precise targets.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.159]  ATACMS is a nuclear-capable, it can fire two different types of warheads.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.520]  One is nuclear, the other is, of course, conventional.
[01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:42.689]  And then the response, which was clear.
[01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:49.750]  I mean, it was an unambiguous response to demonstrate that, look, we can do the same thing.
[01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:57.510]  And if we decide to put nuclear ordinance on that ICBM or IRBM, we can do just the same thing.
[01:19:57.609 --> 01:20:04.270]  And we can actually hit targets, because the targets that were launched at by the ATACMS apparently were not hit.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:15.020]  And so what we have to do is we have to really look hard at what the Russian, and Alex has talked about this a long time now, but this Russian doctrine, this Russian nuclear doctrine.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.840]  So Austin talking like that is incorrect.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.199]  I mean, he may be getting briefed on that.
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.439]  I'm not gonna sit here and say that.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.779]  What he's telling us is the truth or what they actually believe.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:34.699]  But I'm gonna sit here and warn everybody that this is not a time to think conventionally.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:40.359]  This is a time to look at actions and look at capabilities and look at resources and look at how they are.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:21:03.869]  I can tell you that an organization like the National Geospatial Agency, the National Security Agency, if they're doing their jobs, and this is where President Trump comes in because as the incoming president-elect of the United States of America, he has full authority to get access to every single bit of intelligence that's being briefed to President Biden,
[01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:06.930]  if Biden's even getting briefed, if he's even awake.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:17.100]  So he has the full authority and the full capability to be able to get that same intelligence because it's supposed to be a peaceful transfer and transition of power from one president to another.
[01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:19.199]  I don't know if they're doing that.
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.119]  I don't know if they're giving him that kind of information.
[01:21:22.119 --> 01:21:28.710]  I do believe that one of the things that- President Trump needs to be asking for it right now.
[01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:31.609]  He needs to be asking for it very specifically.
[01:21:31.909 --> 01:21:37.970]  Get all that other garbage intel out of my way about what's happening in South America, what's happening in the Pacific.
[01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:41.350]  Get all that out of their way, because it's all set up.
[01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:55.619]  And ask specifically questions about nuclear movements Not only in the Black Sea, in the Baltic, but on the ground, on the movement of missile capabilities and launch capabilities.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.939]  Look at the communication systems.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.180]  I wanna see all that.
[01:21:59.359 --> 01:22:05.640]  Get the best nuclear weapons experts that we have in this country, which he has the full authority.
[01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:10.890]  And the full responsibility to do, get them down at Mar-a-Lago immediately, immediately.
[01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.409]  Have them sit down, brief your entire national security team.
[01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:20.409]  I understand that most of the national security team and most of the folks are still down there doing more additional cabinet picks.
[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:23.130]  But get them in there and get somebody...
[01:22:23.609 --> 01:22:34.750]  With some level of knowledge, and I'm saying that we have people in the government that can do this, but there's also experts outside the government that in some cases either supported or worked in the government at one time.
[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:38.149]  Get them down there now and start looking at the intelligence.
[01:22:38.569 --> 01:22:47.470]  And when they start to show you things, have them make you a believer that what you're actually being briefed on, what they're showing is true.
[01:22:48.279 --> 01:22:50.920]  I mean, drill down, drill down right now.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:56.840]  Because once you lay that out, and now I'm talking directly to President-elect Trump down.
[01:22:56.859 --> 01:22:58.399]  General Flynn, we've got a hard satellite break.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.000]  You'll have the floor.
[01:22:59.079 --> 01:22:59.859]  This is so important.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:09.439]  We're so blessed that you happen to be here today right when this historic escalation of Biden saying we're looking to give nukes to Ukraine and then use that as the proxy, I guess, to start full world war.
[01:23:09.699 --> 01:23:11.420]  We'll be right back with General Flynn.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.220]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:12.319 --> 01:23:12.739]  Stay with us.
[01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:19.890]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.

[01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:56.229]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[01:23:57.050 --> 01:24:06.829]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:13.689]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.

[01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:27.250]  Alright, if you are a new viewer or a new listener, or just a regular listener, we have millions of new people tuning in every day, General Flynn is recognized, even in the Obama administration, as the smartest or most informed general who predicted in his secret briefings over the years everything that came true.
[01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.789]  China double-crossing, you know, all of it.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:33.220]  And so there's a lot of generals that just basically sit at desk all day.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.380]  But he's a real general.
[01:25:34.579 --> 01:25:37.300]  He was the head intelligence officer in the military.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:44.020]  And then, of course, Trump's top national security advisor and number one target of the deep state when Trump got in eight years ago.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:50.039]  So he understands the lay of the land inside the executive branch and also inside the Pentagon.
[01:25:50.039 --> 01:25:52.340]  And then now traveling the country...
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.460]  Waking the people up.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:03.119]  And he laid out so many huge issues in the last 30 minutes that I want to have him continue with his overall briefing, and then I want to drill back in.
[01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:07.859]  But you came on last week and said we need to 25th Amendment him right now or impeach him right now.
[01:26:08.239 --> 01:26:12.760]  People didn't understand that that means it goes to Congress, and now it's basically a trial of who's in there.
[01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:14.300]  Harris can be removed.
[01:26:14.739 --> 01:26:16.800]  Speaker Johnson's not much better, but better.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.180]  We weren't saying put Kamali in.
[01:26:19.829 --> 01:26:27.890]  But they clearly are planning to do something like that and use this escalation, as you were saying, to somehow keep Trump out.
[01:26:28.029 --> 01:26:30.329]  So can you elaborate on the scenarios?
[01:26:30.449 --> 01:26:40.609]  And I know you have a lot of background in each scenario that would take an hour to go over each little piece, but they're pre-programming everywhere civil unrest and Kamala being in and all of this.
[01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:43.630]  And so what would they use to do that?
[01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:45.770]  What are the sub-scenarios of that?
[01:26:45.869 --> 01:26:53.399]  And then explain to people, because I know you're an expert on this, And I had constitutional experts on agreeing with you, and we have Congressman Massey and Senator Hawley and others saying the same thing.
[01:26:53.739 --> 01:26:58.479]  You don't just get rid of Biden during a 25th Amendment operation, you get rid of Harris as well.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:11.819]  But barring that, how do we put pressure on the runaway train, on who is in command, who are these unnamed officials saying, yeah, Well, we're going to escalate so that there'll never be peace before Trump gets in.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:19.319]  And as you said, you have this new northern group forming, England and France saying, if Trump tries to pull out, we'll just officially ourselves go to war.
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.760]  So holding us hostage to nuclear war as well.
[01:27:21.939 --> 01:27:23.600]  This is true madness.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.560]  So the globalists aren't giving up.
[01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:26.680]  They've doubled down.
[01:27:26.819 --> 01:27:27.640]  Please continue, General Flynn.
[01:27:27.899 --> 01:27:30.020]  Yeah, and they've absolutely doubled down.
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:38.279]  And the big why is to completely disrupt President Donald J. Trump's agenda going into this next presidency.
[01:27:38.579 --> 01:27:39.779]  I mean, upset it.
[01:27:39.939 --> 01:27:46.039]  I mean, his principal agenda item, when you really dig down deep, is this...
[01:27:46.739 --> 01:27:58.000]  Deportation campaign, closing our border, basically making the streets of America safer, getting our economy jump-started again, releasing the energy resources of this country.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:10.560]  So all these domestic-focused issues, which would take away from the power base of the globalists, which the power base of the globalists has everything to do with this continuation of perpetual war.
[01:28:10.739 --> 01:28:19.390]  Doesn't make any difference where it's at, and right now it's over and it's It's contained to a degree in Europe.
[01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:30.609]  But we are in the throes of World War III. As I said earlier, the United Kingdom and France have already said that they've sort of threatened Trump.
[01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:34.550]  By saying, well, if you withdraw aid, we're gonna be sending troops in.
[01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.770]  So what?
[01:28:35.869 --> 01:28:36.649]  So what if you do that?
[01:28:36.729 --> 01:28:39.069]  I mean, you think that Trump has to respond to that?
[01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:43.289]  And I think Trump will, in fact, I know he'll be smart enough to know what to do.
[01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:48.310]  But a lot of people have asked since I started to talk about this last week.
[01:28:49.239 --> 01:29:02.100]  If you do the 25th amendment and you get rid of Joe and Joe Biden, and then you have Harris, or you do an impeachment proceeding of President Biden and you have Harris.
[01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:07.000]  Okay, well, there is then the burden to put on her and what she might do.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:11.170]  So Congress has to Stay, you know, awake at the switch here.
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.149]  And I mean, you know, they're going to go on recess.
[01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.890]  I got all that.
[01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:24.130]  But you gotta, folks, you know, Speaker Johnson, you gotta pay attention to what is going on globally because the foreign policy and the foreign wars are what the globalists want.
[01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:28.670]  They couldn't beat the mandate that Trump just had in November.
[01:29:28.949 --> 01:29:32.810]  They couldn't You know, they're too big to rig, however you want to state it.
[01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:42.149]  Trump won, and it upset their momentum, and it upset their plans going into the remainder of this decade and further into this century.
[01:29:42.369 --> 01:29:47.550]  So the advent of World War III, we are in the midst of it.
[01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:55.869]  The exchange of nuclear, very provocative, nuclear-capable weapons have already occurred.
[01:29:56.770 --> 01:30:14.529]  Alex has done an amazing job over these last couple of weeks, really, talking about, and I know we and I have talked about this, talking about the shift in Russia's nuclear policy, talking about first use, and I want people to, you know, he asked me prior about Secretary Austin and what Secretary Austin's comments were,
[01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:23.100]  and I think that You know, what Putin did when he fired this missile, he gave what I call the ultimate warning, okay?
[01:30:23.319 --> 01:30:24.560]  The ultimate warning.
[01:30:24.699 --> 01:30:39.359]  And there are really, and I kind of, you know, I crafted a little bit of this, and again, people can go to GeneralFlynn.com, because I post quite a bit of this, or at Jen Flynn on X. But there's really two camps that are forming now.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.859]  And I can see these two camps.
[01:30:40.979 --> 01:30:46.659]  And one, you know, is within the, I would say, is in the sort of the Trump orbit, the greater Trump orbit.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:51.939]  And there are some people that are, you know, certainly the American people.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:56.800]  And one of those camps is, I call it reason and peace, sort of the camp of reason and peace.
[01:30:56.939 --> 01:30:59.199]  Let's use good, you know, good common sense.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.640]  Let's use reason in what is happening.
[01:31:01.859 --> 01:31:03.399]  Let's try to calm things down.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.409]  Let's try to figure out What is a negotiated peace look like?
[01:31:07.529 --> 01:31:09.149]  What will a negotiated peace look like?
[01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:19.689]  And there are all kinds of different avenues and options on the table right now to take or to apply for a peace agreement.
[01:31:19.689 --> 01:31:26.189]  But the biggest thing that has to happen right now is there's got to be a ceasing of the killing that is occurring.
[01:31:26.369 --> 01:31:27.710]  That's camp number one.
[01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:32.409]  The second camp, and I call it the camp of unconsciousness or connivance.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.239]  Okay?
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:34.939]  That will lead to war.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.479]  The camp of unconsciousness or connivance.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.939]  The unconsciousness component of that camp is sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue right now.
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.140]  There's an unconscious, you know, Alex uses the word sleepwalking.
[01:31:49.479 --> 01:32:01.359]  You know, there's an unconsciousness that is occurring that you have to say, okay, part of that unconsciousness is a conventional thinking that no one's going to use a nuclear weapon here.
[01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:16.930]  Well, let me tell you, folks, what I just said about five minutes ago, the ultimate warning message from Vladimir Putin to, not to Ukraine, but to the West, to say, hey, folks, look, we are not,
[01:32:17.069 --> 01:32:26.409]  I have a responsibility, now I'm Putting my feet, which I've had to do for my entire military career, was to put my feet into the boots of our enemies, okay?
[01:32:26.609 --> 01:32:35.369]  So my analysis of where President Putin is at is he's got to sit there with his own people and say, we are going to protect the sovereignty of our country.
[01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:38.770]  We are going to protect the safety and security of our citizenry.
[01:32:38.909 --> 01:32:47.050]  And I can't allow a nuclear-capable, offensive, provocative weapon to be fired into Russia without some type of...
[01:32:47.569 --> 01:32:54.810]  Of response, without some type of adjustment in my military and in my political, my diplomatic posture.
[01:32:55.149 --> 01:33:01.029]  If everybody listened to, and people need to do this, you need to listen to the messaging coming out of Russia.
[01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:18.029]  And I'm really now speaking to not just You know, the audience, Alex's great audience, I'm speaking to people at Mar-a-Lago, this unconscious crowd that's in Washington, D.C., part of the deep state, that is going to sit there and go, oh yeah, we're going to keep pushing this thing.
[01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:18.689]  We want this thing.
[01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:21.630]  Look, folks, we're talking about nuclear war.
[01:33:21.789 --> 01:33:24.130]  To even use the word nuclear...
[01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:29.789]  This is where I kinda, to me it's like, okay, slow down, take a deep breath.
[01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:36.649]  This is where the world needs to stop and say, look, we're talking about nuclear, the use of nuclear weapons.
[01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:43.670]  And I wanna tell people that you're gonna hear words like tactical, Phrases like tactical nuclear weapon.
[01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:46.649]  And let me just tell you, there is no such thing.
[01:33:46.909 --> 01:33:53.210]  When somebody says tactical nuclear weapon, and it's written about, there's doctrine about use of tactical nukes.
[01:33:53.310 --> 01:34:01.510]  We talk about tactical nukes on the battlefield because they have the devastating effects from a tactical nuke.
[01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:08.869]  But these are nuclear weapons that still have like 50 times more power Then what?
[01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:15.750]  The United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war in the Pacific against the imperialist Japanese.
[01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:19.449]  So, I mean, these are very, very powerful weapons.
[01:34:19.689 --> 01:34:23.390]  We have just had both sides exchange weapons.
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:30.359]  A weapon system, ATACMS, and then what the Russians responded with that are both nuclear capable.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:39.779]  The ultimate, I'm going to say this again, the ultimate warning signal to the West by Vladimir Putin was when he fired those missiles and they went after certain targets.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.600]  And that will change in a heartbeat.
[01:34:42.779 --> 01:34:45.720]  If we start to see now, because one of the scenarios that...
[01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:49.109]  That I talk about is a false flag, a false flag.
[01:34:49.289 --> 01:35:00.329]  And it got me thinking about the false flag thing was really this cutting of this cable between, I think it was Sweden and Finland up in the Baltic Sea.
[01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:06.109]  And there's all kinds of things that are happening sort of in the shadows.
[01:35:07.009 --> 01:35:19.670]  Globally, when you're talking about great powers and the competition between great powers and how we operate on the world stage to be able to have this competitive atmosphere, particularly military forces arrayed against military forces.
[01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:23.949]  Well, right now, is there a heightened alert in our country?
[01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:36.029]  Are our nuclear capabilities, our triad, our ballistic missiles, our aircraft, our submarine fleet, are they at a heightened status?
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.539]  I mean, I haven't heard anything.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.319]  We haven't seen anything.
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.720]  We have not had any emergency alerts or anything like that.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.640]  So there are things that are not well oiled.
[01:35:48.739 --> 01:36:00.319]  We have a machinery in our country right now because we've spent 20, 25 years in these Low-intensity conflict-type wars, these irregular wars, these wars against terrorists.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.399]  And we have an entirely conventional capability.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:10.859]  And I can tell you, I know this system and I know the exercise system that we have on a daily basis that's run out of the Pentagon.
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:13.539]  They're very capable people that do that.
[01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:18.930]  But you have to have the next levels of leadership be involved and be responsive.
[01:36:19.170 --> 01:36:24.729]  So let's take it back to the potential idea for getting rid of Joe Biden.
[01:36:24.829 --> 01:36:33.949]  I just feel in my gut, total speculation, but it's a scenario, it's a possibility that they are going to get rid of Joe Biden.
[01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:36.149]  And I just feel that before...
[01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:39.210]  Probably in the next couple of weeks here.
[01:36:39.670 --> 01:36:40.750]  So that brings in Kamala.
[01:36:40.869 --> 01:36:42.090]  Everybody goes, well, we don't want Kamala.
[01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:43.210]  We don't want the 25th Amendment.
[01:36:43.329 --> 01:36:44.449]  We don't want to impeach Biden.
[01:36:44.909 --> 01:36:45.409]  Well, you know what?
[01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:48.670]  You put Kamala Harris in the hot seat.
[01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:53.010]  And Congress, this is where Congress, and thank God we have the House.
[01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:54.970]  But I don't think that the House is doing enough.
[01:36:55.510 --> 01:37:04.390]  This gets to Trump's conversations with his team going forward and the idea that there is...
[01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:09.710]  I still believe that there are going to be attempts on Trump's life.
[01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:11.369]  Speculation, to a degree.
[01:37:11.569 --> 01:37:12.909]  We've already seen a couple.
[01:37:13.529 --> 01:37:14.409]  These people...
[01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:16.770]  Want ultimate power.
[01:37:16.949 --> 01:37:23.250]  And ultimate power only exists when you have total control of the United States government and the United States of America.
[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:24.930]  And they've more than signaled, General.
[01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:25.590]  Oh, big time.
[01:37:25.829 --> 01:37:26.149]  Big time.
[01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:27.930]  With the escalation of the missiles.
[01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:34.430]  And then Putin, as you know, when Biden first talked about it two months ago, he said, if you move those missiles up, they can be nuclear tipped.
[01:37:34.529 --> 01:37:36.630]  We don't know if you're firing nukes at us.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:39.220]  If we see that, we may go ahead and nuke Europe.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:45.800]  And then now, back to the ICBM test, or the intermediate-range ballistic missile, what did Putin come out and say?
[01:37:46.079 --> 01:37:47.560]  He said, this is a test.
[01:37:47.579 --> 01:37:49.060]  We evaded your anti-missile systems.
[01:37:49.199 --> 01:37:51.800]  We can hit you with MIRV technology with nukes.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.260]  So that was another warning.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:55.920]  And he said, more warnings are coming.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.220]  What do you...
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.779]  Here's what I wrote this morning.
[01:38:00.439 --> 01:38:02.239]  I'll read this quick sentence.
[01:38:02.399 --> 01:38:03.220]  The deep state...
[01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:10.569]  We're good to go.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.579]  This is really important, but a controlled military commitment, okay?
[01:38:23.859 --> 01:38:28.579]  And without the risk of annihilation, especially of our own national territory.
[01:38:28.899 --> 01:38:32.760]  This is what these people, they will think like this.
[01:38:32.899 --> 01:38:37.000]  So they're, again, like an Austin kind of making his comment, the question you had for me before.
[01:38:37.659 --> 01:38:42.199]  There's a very conventional mindset because we've had- Normalcy bias.
[01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.149]  Exactly.
[01:38:43.409 --> 01:38:47.069]  We've had none of these kinds of conversations for decades, right?
[01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:49.630]  And we've had relationships.
[01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:56.590]  Hell, we've worked with the Russians from back in the 90s of what's called the Partners for Peace program.
[01:38:56.590 --> 01:38:58.710]  So there's true naivete institutionally.
[01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:59.250]  It's incredible.
[01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:13.619]  What has happened, the bigger strategic picture, and this is where I think, from Trump's perspective, And everybody, I mean, everybody knows this, but from Trump's perspective, this administration, and frankly, Obama did the same thing.
[01:39:13.819 --> 01:39:19.479]  They have pushed Russia towards China, and that is not something that we want.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.699]  What we want is we want to figure out this sort of greater European mass, okay?
[01:39:25.939 --> 01:39:39.590]  And this is the United States of America, as we figure out Sort of the developed world, if you will, even though that world is changing quite a bit because of what I call sort of this Chinese rising, right?
[01:39:39.729 --> 01:39:42.149]  China rising, as we've talked about many, many times.
[01:39:42.369 --> 01:39:57.899]  When China has access to or ownership of or partial ownership of about 80% of the ports around the world, Okay, so the largest ports in the world, China either has direct access,
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:02.279]  ownership, or partial ownership of some of the- And they've got most of the rare earth minerals.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:14.140]  And the rare earth elements that are out there, the direct access or ownership of some of the major lines of water, lines of communication, Suez Canal and the Panama Canal.
[01:40:14.279 --> 01:40:22.920]  And Xi issued red lines a week ago for the first time, not just saying Taiwan will go to war, but they said if you get in the way of our development, which means their hegemonic economic takeover.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:28.239]  Right, and the alliances that China has formed in South America, right?
[01:40:28.479 --> 01:40:32.239]  Using Venezuela, using Bolivia, using Brazil.
[01:40:32.539 --> 01:40:38.439]  I mean, the alliances that they have formed in Africa, the alliances that they have formed in Europe.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.319]  The alliances that they have formed with the BRICS nations.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.359]  So China is like sitting back.
[01:40:44.579 --> 01:40:46.180]  And you know what you don't hear, folks?
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.739]  You don't hear China, China, China.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.039]  You hear Russia, Russia, Russia.
[01:40:49.319 --> 01:41:03.119]  Because for the better part of really since the end of World War II, and we started it on the Cold War, and everybody goes, well, the Cold War ended, and everybody remembers the very famous phrase that Obama used against...
[01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:07.489]  Romney, you know, that enemy's sort of gone.
[01:41:07.710 --> 01:41:10.850]  That is billions, billions.
[01:41:11.029 --> 01:41:23.630]  Actually, it's probably tens of trillions of dollars that the United States government has invested or spent and continues to spend over time, over probably the better part of 50 years.
[01:41:23.789 --> 01:41:26.369]  And military complexes always tend to try to fight the last war.
[01:41:26.590 --> 01:41:27.149]  Exactly.
[01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:28.470]  And so that...
[01:41:29.359 --> 01:41:33.800]  Sort of structure that has been created and now continues to exist.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.560]  And money keeps flowing, right?
[01:41:35.899 --> 01:41:39.300]  I mean, NATO at the end of the Cold War was like 16 nations.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:45.859]  Right now it's like, I think we're up to like 26. That's one of the criteria that Russia has always talked about.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.939]  So it is a runaway train.
[01:41:47.159 --> 01:41:49.159]  It's so out of control.
[01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:52.109]  And I, you know, I won.
[01:41:52.329 --> 01:41:54.449]  I want Trump to stay protected.
[01:41:54.449 --> 01:41:57.430]  So this is to you, Donald Trump, down in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:59.350]  You're in a great spot right down there.
[01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:00.510]  Keep yourself very secure.
[01:42:00.609 --> 01:42:04.689]  Be very careful that nobody knows what X you're going to go on.
[01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:06.270]  If you're going to go travel someplace...
[01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:07.670]  I've noticed he's not traveling a lot.
[01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.149]  That's your...
[01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:19.430]  And I firmly believe that he has got, because they're not giving him all of the resources that he should have when he, in fact, if he decides to travel, nor the resources that he would have if he was the President of the United States.
[01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:29.649]  He should have access to and the authority to apply any resource that the federal government, that the United States government has, because he is the duly elected by the United States President of the United States.
[01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:33.149]  We know early on, he and Musk called Zelensky and others.
[01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:37.569]  Now, I've been told by sources, and you talk to him all the time, that he's doing shadow diplomacy there.
[01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:38.909]  But you're saying he's the president-elect.
[01:42:38.909 --> 01:42:40.909]  He has the power for the briefings, all of it.
[01:42:41.069 --> 01:42:44.810]  Now, he's been uncharacteristically silent in the last week.
[01:42:44.869 --> 01:42:49.930]  And I'm not going to second-guess him, but maybe you can tell us what you think or know is going on.
[01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:54.729]  And separately, we had Rutt, you know, the head of NATO, going there a few days ago.
[01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.130]  Can you tell us what's happening behind the scenes or what?
[01:42:58.149 --> 01:43:03.810]  Yeah, well, what I'll say is that NATO is all for what is happening in Ukraine right now.
[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:11.829]  I mean, NATO wants to, you know, the NATO leadership has been talking about, the Secretary General has been talking about the use of nuclear weapons.
[01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:17.869]  I mean, the talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely, should be off the table.
[01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:21.810]  And we should have people talking to each other.
[01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:22.470]  It's beyond reckless.
[01:43:22.770 --> 01:43:23.829]  It's hugely reckless.
[01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:31.069]  I mean, these are weapons systems that, again, when the cat gets out of the bag there, I mean, you can't put that back in there.
[01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:37.289]  And so what we don't want to do is we don't want to go to a place, and I want to remind people, you know, historically, and history matters.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:48.720]  World War I, which at the time was called the Great War, was started because, it was actually a regional conflict, and it turned into a world war, okay?
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:57.319]  So the regional conflict, because people just tripped over each other, and they, you know, they didn't have the good communications that we have today, although they still had communications.
[01:43:57.399 --> 01:43:58.000]  And it escalated.
[01:43:58.159 --> 01:44:00.180]  It escalated, and it escalated like that.
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:06.520]  And once it started, I mean, the devastation, you know, the Great Britain lost an entire generation of men.
[01:44:07.659 --> 01:44:09.279]  General, what do you make of...
[01:44:09.279 --> 01:44:11.180]  This is going on for two and a half years.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.359]  They admit Biden doesn't ever talk to Putin.
[01:44:13.619 --> 01:44:14.819]  No one's talking to them.
[01:44:14.899 --> 01:44:18.640]  But Milley, on January 6th, calls the head Chinese general and says, don't worry, I'm really the president.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.600]  I got the nuke codes.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:21.800]  Trump wasn't even thinking about China then.
[01:44:21.979 --> 01:44:24.579]  So they can talk to the Chinese and say, don't worry, we're in charge.
[01:44:24.699 --> 01:44:25.220]  Trump isn't.
[01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.779]  But then they don't talk to the Russians.
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:27.380]  Yeah.
[01:44:27.579 --> 01:44:30.420]  And I think that this is where people need to understand.
[01:44:30.579 --> 01:44:32.039]  The audience needs to understand.
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.000]  America needs to understand.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.319]  The world needs to understand that the Chinese...
[01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:40.149]  The CCP have so infiltrated the United States of America.
[01:44:40.289 --> 01:44:41.470]  They've infiltrated our government.
[01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:46.590]  They've infiltrated our non-governmental institutions, education system.
[01:44:46.789 --> 01:44:49.750]  They have bought up real estate all over the place.
[01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.409]  We've seen lots of reports about that.
[01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:52.590]  They've bought up companies.
[01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:55.329]  They come in as a Chinese entity.
[01:44:55.329 --> 01:44:58.270]  But then they're really smart about how they use our system.
[01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:02.729]  And they create these organizations and government institutions.
[01:45:10.909 --> 01:45:12.430]  We're good to go.
[01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:23.529]  To achieve where they're at right now.
[01:45:23.909 --> 01:45:24.770]  Does China have problems?
[01:45:24.909 --> 01:45:25.550]  They certainly do.
[01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:27.050]  And Trump fully understands it.
[01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:30.909]  That's why what Trump did in his first administration was go right at China.
[01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:34.430]  And what he's gonna have to do, he's gonna have to go right at China.
[01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:37.770]  And we need to draw these other giant...
[01:45:38.079 --> 01:45:38.979]  You know, powers.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.420]  India is another one.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.640]  We have to be very careful with the nation of India, with the country of India, to where we can't...
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.159]  We don't want India to kind of stay in a place where they're neutral.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:49.920]  We want India...
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.479]  Yeah, it's really going into Russia's orbit.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.619]  Yeah, they really are.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.420]  When you talk about the BRICS, right?
[01:45:54.479 --> 01:46:01.359]  The BRICS nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, plus another, I don't know, 25, 30 nations that have partnered with them.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:01.899]  So...
[01:46:01.899 --> 01:46:02.739]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:46:04.039 --> 01:46:07.539]  What do we do right now, General Flynn, to...
[01:46:09.319 --> 01:46:12.199]  I think we're a radio listener, General Michael Flynn, former of the Defense Telescope.
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.340]  He's here with us graciously today.
[01:46:13.539 --> 01:46:14.220]  A whole other hour.
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:16.159]  Your calls, your comments, your questions coming up.
[01:46:16.939 --> 01:46:21.800]  What do we do as just average citizens other than pray and say we don't want World War III and we support presidents?
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.060]  Do we call Speaker Johnson's office and say you better stop?
[01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.720]  We call Lindsey Graham's office.
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:33.819]  I mean, what do we do to say, hey, who are the officials in the New York Times saying, hey, we're getting ready to give nukes to Ukraine?
[01:46:34.039 --> 01:46:36.020]  I mean, just beyond insane.
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.279]  What do we need to do?
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.680]  And then what does Congress need to do?
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.939]  And again, where is Trump?
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.000]  I'm not putting him down.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:47.800]  I know behind the scenes he's doing some diplomacy, but he needs to come out and speak out about this.
[01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:52.029]  Yeah, you know, we always say there's one government at a time during these periods of transition.
[01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:55.649]  And I, you know, I mean, people watch what happened to me, right?
[01:46:55.829 --> 01:47:03.949]  To calm a situation down that could have gotten vastly worse back in 2016. So people can go, you know, they can go examine that if they want to examine that.
[01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:15.760]  My very famous phone call with the Russian ambassador to calm the situation down so he didn't start World War III while Obama, which is what he wanted to do, he wanted to get, he wanted to Russia's ire up.
[01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:18.840]  So we have one government at a time.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.699]  I understand that.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:30.119]  But that doesn't mean that President Donald J. Trump can't pick up the phone and start calling around to people and saying, look, folks, this is what my agenda is going to be.
[01:47:30.199 --> 01:47:32.000]  And it's not going to be nuclear war.
[01:47:32.119 --> 01:47:35.840]  It's not going to be in support of World War III. So stop it.
[01:47:35.939 --> 01:47:38.000]  And he needs to talk to Biden.
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:39.380]  He needs to talk to Kamala.
[01:47:39.659 --> 01:47:46.350]  He needs to get the counterparts that he has chosen, even though The tough thing is, is many of them are not confirmed.
[01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:52.189]  He's got National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who's came out with, I thought, a calming statement.
[01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:53.729]  I think it was yesterday or the day before.
[01:47:54.229 --> 01:48:00.409]  Mike's had different, you know, ideas about the wars in the United States.
[01:48:00.439 --> 01:48:01.680]  But at least he's de-escalating.
[01:48:01.819 --> 01:48:02.619]  He's de-escalating.
[01:48:02.939 --> 01:48:06.500]  So Trump, because he's in that position, he is the duly elected.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.039]  J.D. Vance is the duly elected vice president of the United States.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.560]  There has to be communications right now.
[01:48:13.039 --> 01:48:14.000]  General, this is important.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:14.659]  We've got to go to break.
[01:48:14.779 --> 01:48:14.979]  Stay there.
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:16.920]  You'd have the floor on this when we come back.
[01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:22.909]  Then we'll start taking some questions from X, also probably some calls, specifically quick questions for General Flynn.
[01:48:23.369 --> 01:48:25.430]  Please remember, GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:26.229]  He needs your support.
[01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:27.470]  He came here on his own dime.
[01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:28.729]  He travels the whole country.
[01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.430]  Great books, t-shirts, ball caps.
[01:48:30.529 --> 01:48:35.170]  I was wearing, went out and ate Mexican food yesterday with my wife and youngest daughter, wearing my General Flynn hat, got a compliment.
[01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:35.989]  We love General Flynn.
[01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:37.430]  I was eating at Chewy's restaurant.
[01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:39.050]  The point is, support him.
[01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:40.350]  He needs support just like I do.
[01:48:40.449 --> 01:48:41.689]  We are your emissaries.
[01:48:42.119 --> 01:48:48.539]  For Americana and freedom and justice and security and American values and stopping World War III, GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:48:48.539 --> 01:48:49.659]  Be sure and support him there.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.380]  Get his film.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:51.619]  It is amazing, incredible.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.859]  It's all there at GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.520]  And then please keep me on air.
[01:48:55.859 --> 01:48:59.140]  Yeah, Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit in my support against the Democrats today.
[01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:00.710]  He's fully in our case.
[01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:01.109]  That's great.
[01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.909]  The cavalry's coming.
[01:49:02.050 --> 01:49:04.829]  But we sell supplements and t-shirts and books and things.
[01:49:05.170 --> 01:49:06.270]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[01:49:06.449 --> 01:49:07.270]  I'm on a regular show.
[01:49:07.369 --> 01:49:10.770]  I got the deep state coming after me trying to put me in prison just like I tried to do to him.
[01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:11.850]  So we're your champions.
[01:49:12.069 --> 01:49:14.210]  Not saying I'm the best, but the enemy sees me as that.
[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:17.050]  I can't do this without you, so I'm fighting for you.
[01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.970]  Please fight for us.
[01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:20.189]  Keep sharing the articles, the videos, the live feeds.
[01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:30.449]  You're the Paul Revere's, but also go to thealexshonestore.com and get the amazing supplements like the superfood ultimate CMOS, the great Trump apparel, and more at thealexshonestore.com.
[01:49:30.609 --> 01:49:32.529]  Hour number three with General Michael Flynn.
[01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:33.590]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:49:33.939 --> 01:49:38.279]  The major central banks of the globe are owned by a handful of families.
[01:49:38.579 --> 01:49:50.819]  That's why the head of the private Federal Reserve last week, Jerome Powell, pledged to try to block Trump's agenda and said that even if Trump tries to fire him, he won't leave because he is above the law.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.640]  They are a private agency.
[01:49:52.939 --> 01:49:57.159]  Some of the president-elect's advisors have suggested that you should resign.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.920]  If he asked you to leave, would you go?
[01:50:00.399 --> 01:50:00.699]  No.
[01:50:01.899 --> 01:50:07.439]  Can you follow up on, do you think that legally you're not required to leave?
[01:50:07.899 --> 01:50:08.140]  No.
[01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:21.340]  Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no other agency of government Which can overrule actions that we take.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:28.640]  But Congress created the private agency of the Federal Reserve and can revoke their charter and abolish them.
[01:50:28.819 --> 01:50:50.130]  And that's why it's so exciting to see former Congressman Ron Paul coming in to advise the administration We're good to go.
[01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:52.859]  The heart of it going after their predatory loans.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:51:00.239]  Now, in closing here, InfoWars is set to be sold at auction Wednesday, coming up in less than 48 hours.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.079]  If good guys don't buy it, we will be shut down.
[01:51:03.439 --> 01:51:07.899]  But regardless, backups are being set up, new systems are in place with the Alex Jones Network.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:17.239]  And your sponsorship, supporting us at thealexjonesstore.com with great supplements, great Patriot apparel, like this great shirt, is what is going to keep us on air.
[01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:24.170]  We came out with three great limited edition fundraiser posters that are very, very popular.
[01:51:24.449 --> 01:51:34.729]  And I decided a few days ago to design a new one, another limited edition that just came out today and has now been printed in Arkansas and is ready to ship to you.
[01:51:34.989 --> 01:51:35.850]  Here it is on screen.
[01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:37.029]  Iconic.
[01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:47.550]  Takes the meme of what we predicted Harris would do trying to steal it, but that Trump would overpower the fraud, which is exactly what happened on the day of the election.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:59.300]  On the eve of the election, on November 4th, on that Monday last week, I posted that meme and I said, this is my prediction for the election and that's exactly what happened.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:05.800]  So now it's that image, posterized, beautiful, striking, with...
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.060]  Three simple words at the bottom.
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.119]  Back to back to back.
[01:52:11.359 --> 01:52:12.140]  That's right.
[01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:15.260]  He's the only president to ever run three times.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.000]  And he's the only president to ever win in reality three times.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.140]  He won in 16. He won in...
[01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:28.210]  2020 and he won in 2024, but this time the landslide was so big they could not stop him.
[01:52:28.590 --> 01:52:30.109]  This is historic.
[01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:34.329]  We've won the battle, now we've got to win the war to get him into office and drain the swamp.
[01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:40.640]  And to do that he's got to have folks like Infowars reaching 60, 70 million people a day right now.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:45.920]  The most reach we've ever had thanks to you supporting and spreading the word and the world waking up.
[01:52:46.079 --> 01:52:50.699]  Everybody wants to hear what myself and the crew and the other reporters and our guests are saying.
[01:52:50.859 --> 01:53:04.340]  And to make sure we stay on the air, even if InfoWars shuts down, go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and get the Trump Patriot apparel, get the posters, there's limited edition, and that will ensure we stay on the air.
[01:53:04.539 --> 01:53:07.220]  So for myself and the entire crew, history's happening now.
[01:53:07.399 --> 01:53:08.460]  Thanks for your support.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.920]  God bless and good luck.
[01:53:10.159 --> 01:53:14.140]  Now go to thealexjonesstore.com and get these limited edition posters.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:15.079]  Thank you so much.
[01:53:41.010 --> 01:53:45.090]  Rome had always been an inclusive society that welcomed immigrants.
[01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:50.970]  Immigrants were given employment in the Roman army, but were welcome only if they assimilated.
[01:53:51.210 --> 01:53:52.949]  Of course, Rome still fell.
[01:53:53.350 --> 01:54:07.010]  What makes anyone think that the United States and Europe can absorb violent non-assimilating immigrants from all over the world, with the result not ultimately collapsing 21st century civilization?
[01:54:09.569 --> 01:54:13.010]  The drug crisis in the United States continues to escalate.
[01:54:13.170 --> 01:54:16.609]  This year, more than 100,000 Americans died due to a drug overdose.
[01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:19.949]  It is now one of the top ten reasons for deaths in America.
[01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:31.510]  Studies show taxpayers are being billed about $1,600 a year per immigrant, and that immigrants use 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizens.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:47.840]  Similarly, about 63% of non-citizen households use at least one form of public welfare, while only about 35% of native-born American households are on welfare.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:51.699]  The architects of this collapse know full well what they're doing.
[01:54:51.899 --> 01:54:56.859]  We hear frequently that people are at the center of sustainable development.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:01.859]  And we know that, by definition, people are at the center of populations.
[01:55:02.949 --> 01:55:14.229]  Well, from these two simple observations, it follows that an understanding of population patterns and trends will be essential for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
[01:55:14.489 --> 01:55:19.329]  We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct.
[01:55:19.789 --> 01:55:32.029]  Exposed by James O'Keefe and his people at O'Keefe Media Group, Alvin Bragg received massive numbers of campaign finance contributions from this network of individuals who had been identified as Smurfs.
[01:55:32.529 --> 01:55:38.390]  FEC data shows that some senior citizens across the U.S. have been donating thousands of times per year.
[01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:39.890]  You did donate to ActBlue, right?
[01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:44.010]  Yes, once in a while, yes.
[01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:45.949]  What about $18,850?
[01:55:46.369 --> 01:55:47.210]  I doubt that.
[01:55:57.899 --> 01:56:08.180]  The investigation into Alvin Bragg also helped to uncover the use of prepaid credit and debit cards in the structuring of the campaign finance contributions.
[01:56:08.649 --> 01:56:11.750]  And the payment to ballot harvesting mules.
[01:56:12.069 --> 01:56:30.529]  Illicit campaign finance funds were also identified in the campaigns of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race of Janet Protasiewicz and Senator Ralph Warnock, and spread to states such as Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Arizona, and then into every single state in the United States.
[01:56:30.689 --> 01:56:37.449]  We have videotape of Jackie Amos going into boxes, bringing in thumb drives.
[01:56:38.039 --> 01:56:42.100]  Bringing in ballots to be inserted into machines.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.800]  This is the opportunity.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:51.319]  To stop corruption and to stop fraud when it comes to elections in the state of Mississippi.
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:55.560]  This is what Fannie Willis and the Democrats have created in Atlanta.
[01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:58.039]  Boarded up and abandoned homes everywhere.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.359]  Crack houses for blocks and blocks.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.579]  Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.
[01:57:04.079 --> 01:57:07.500]  Another inmate died in custody.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:12.420]  Five inmates in the last month, all black.
[01:57:13.079 --> 01:57:13.520]  Why?
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:22.720]  Now let me see here, you got a black mayor, you got a black prosecutor, you got a black sheriff, and black people are dying at the jail.
[01:57:23.439 --> 01:57:24.779]  Where's Al Sharpton?
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.319]  Where's Kamala Harris?
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.460]  Where's Joe Biden?
[01:57:29.779 --> 01:57:30.680]  Nowhere to be found.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:31.760]  Where's Black Lives Matter?
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:51.779]  222 contributions to Atlanta DA Fannie Willis' campaign had zero donor information, while one of the out-of-state Fannie Willis campaign contributors had made over 9,178 individual contributions just at the federal level since 2018. Meanwhile,
[01:57:52.079 --> 01:58:01.859]  this nationwide money laundering RICO enterprise is making more and more contributions to PACs and these PACs in turn are financing local candidates.
[01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:08.060]  This RICO operation is at the heart of the Democrat Party's ability to retain power.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:15.640]  A full-fledged organized crime operation with strong ties to a myriad of Soros connected organizations.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:22.399]  operating within a one-world government agenda framework to destroy the United States.
[01:58:22.539 --> 01:58:28.859]  Now delivered on a silver platter to an unwilling Congress ushering in its own demise.
[01:58:29.159 --> 01:58:30.680]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:58:32.710 --> 01:58:36.170]  At Jen Flynn on X, be sure and follow him there.
[01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:39.369]  General Michael Flynn is our guest.
[01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:46.109]  He graciously, as he's been coming on so much with us, he's very busy, but he's one of the only people that has this level of understanding.
[01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:54.550]  He's been joining us once or twice a week in the last month, and the average interview gets about 40 million views on X. People really want to hear from General Flynn.
[01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:59.090]  Of course, people listen to him and watch him by the tens of millions as well on his X and his own views.
[01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:13.289]  We're good to go.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.579]  During that five-minute break that he said he'll be willing to say on air here, and he's not trying to scare you.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:25.479]  I totally agree with him.
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:29.619]  I think you're going to agree with him, but he's an expert in these things, taking all the data and collecting it in.
[01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:37.420]  These military moves towards nuclear war and the missiles and trying to give nukes to Ukraine and all of this are not signs.
[01:59:37.939 --> 01:59:39.100]  They're giant...
[01:59:43.170 --> 01:59:54.569]  We're good to go.
[02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:08.050]  General, you made a very cryptic statement to me and then elaborated during the break.
[02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:11.329]  If you can repeat that and elaborate and then get into what we should all be doing.
[02:00:11.489 --> 02:00:16.350]  And again, he's saying this not to scare you, but to create real urgency because he's a very calm guy.
[02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:24.250]  We all need to be praying for President Trump right now because there's obvious peace to all of this that they're going to be trying to do.
[02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:26.090]  And you said in the next few weeks, General Flynn.
[02:00:26.359 --> 02:00:40.659]  Yeah, I do think that as we go into this season of Thanksgiving, right, the greatest threat after this wonderful mandate presidential victory that President Donald J. Trump and his family just had, the greatest threat is the risk of a third assassination attempt.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:56.189]  And I do believe that just, you know, it's gut at this point, but it's based on what we have already seen and the kinds of craziness behind it, the The types of security arrangements that he's had.
[02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:59.310]  The lack of, frankly, of trust that the American people have.
[02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:03.890]  And the security arrangements that are currently, that were provided to candidate Trump.
[02:01:04.050 --> 02:01:07.470]  Now President-elect Trump, you know, it's still not there.
[02:01:07.670 --> 02:01:13.350]  That in the next couple of weeks, I firmly believe that there is going to be another attempt at this man's life.
[02:01:13.409 --> 02:01:18.810]  And I hate to talk like that, but it is a, he is, he represents Trump.
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.239]  By himself, as the president elect again, he represents an existential threat to the globalists.
[02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:39.680]  Because if he's able to achieve what he wants to achieve through guys like Elon, through this doge or whatever you wanna call it, and through some of the ideas that he has, and he's already demonstrated that he's fully capable of doing them.
[02:01:39.979 --> 02:01:54.989]  While he was under extraordinary pressure during the time that he was the 45th president, If he gets into office and he's able to get his agenda into high gear, then it could be the end of the deep state.
[02:01:55.529 --> 02:01:56.810]  And it should be.
[02:01:56.970 --> 02:02:08.699]  It could be the end of this globalist movement To take over basically the world and what they call this new world order, which has been talked about for over 100 years now.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:11.399]  So, I mean, all of these things are real.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:13.779]  This is not bullshit conspiracy theory stuff.
[02:02:13.979 --> 02:02:15.479]  This is real stuff.
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:32.310]  And people need to understand that Donald J. Trump is one of these very, very He's one of these great captains of history, these great leaders that emerge only once in a millennium, in many cases, in world history.
[02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:36.470]  And I'm talking about going back hundreds of hundreds of years, right?
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.800]  I call them the arcs of history.
[02:02:40.939 --> 02:02:42.619]  The first one was the Revolutionary War.
[02:02:42.739 --> 02:02:46.180]  That was George Washington, where, thank God, we had a leader like him.
[02:02:46.279 --> 02:02:49.420]  The second arc of history was Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.
[02:02:49.579 --> 02:03:02.319]  We had the great leadership of Abraham Lincoln, a man that lost like seven or eight races, political races, and then finally became president of the United States at the right moment in history to be able to save our country and keep it united.
[02:03:02.939 --> 02:03:18.079]  We went through a whole bunch of, you know, the next 150, 170 years or so, but nothing that we went through from the time of the Civil War, the end of the Civil War, till now, till right now, was there an existential threat to our way of life here.
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:29.720]  Yep, maybe we lost to the Huns in World War I or lost to the Germans and the Japanese in World War II. There would be a different set of conditions, but it wasn't existential to the geography of the United States of America or to our way of life.
[02:03:30.279 --> 02:03:33.979]  This is existential, and that's Donald J. Trump.
[02:03:34.159 --> 02:03:40.920]  In this third arc of U.S. history, Donald J. Trump represents an existential threat to these globalists that are trying to take over.
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:49.720]  And so what he's got to do, so this assassination attempt that I do believe that they're not done trying to do this, and I wrote about this about a week or so ago.
[02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:54.029]  As one of the scenarios, I think that we're looking at something in the next couple of weeks here.
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:04:00.630]  I love the fact that he's operating and transitioning and functioning out of Mar-a-Lago.
[02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:05.449]  I do believe when I say, be very careful for President Trump.
[02:04:05.529 --> 02:04:09.189]  So now I'm talking to him and I know that he understands this.
[02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:11.630]  Be very careful about where you have to go.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:24.399]  Because if you have to leave those compounds, and I know you're not a bunker mentality type of guy, you want to get out there amongst the people because that's why you are who you are and why the- But that's the desperate bad guy's obvious next move.
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:24.920]  Yeah, it is.
[02:04:24.939 --> 02:04:27.260]  You're willing to start World War III and they already tried to kill him twice.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:33.960]  So to just, you know, take a minute to just say, what should Trump be doing based on what we've just talked about over the last hour?
[02:04:34.079 --> 02:04:37.800]  So he needs to get his national security team around him right now, which I know he has.
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.560]  He needs to make some phone calls.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:40.579]  He's got to call Biden up.
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:41.460]  He's got to call up Harris.
[02:04:41.579 --> 02:04:47.079]  Those are just sort of the protocols to say, hey, look, guys and gal, what the hell are you guys doing?
[02:04:47.439 --> 02:05:01.340]  I would actually have those members of his national security team with him talking to the exact same group of people because, folks, We are going to get into power here on the 20th of January, and we are going to move this country forward.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.340]  But that conversation has to happen now.
[02:05:03.579 --> 02:05:14.300]  And then if Biden refuses to talk to Putin, if he refuses to talk to the people that are running this globalist crowd, or to China, because China has a big foot in the door here.
[02:05:14.699 --> 02:05:29.399]  That he ought to tell Biden, I'm going to make those calls because I'm going to have to assume this problem if, in fact, it continues to move down this path that we're looking at right now, which is we're looking at World War III right now.
[02:05:29.739 --> 02:05:36.800]  The exchange of these things, the exchange of the discussions that I've been having over the last week.
[02:05:36.939 --> 02:05:40.079]  And this is where I think Congress definitely needs to step back in.
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:49.050]  They're getting ready to go on a On a recess here, and I think Trump ought to talk to Mike Johnson and just say, to Speaker Johnson, just say, hey, look, you guys have got to up the rhetoric here a little bit.
[02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:50.770]  We've got to put pressure on the White House.
[02:05:50.909 --> 02:06:03.470]  We can't not allow, I mean, the amount of money, the amount of weaponry that has been given to Ukraine with all of the troubles that we have in our own country To me, it kills me.
[02:06:03.529 --> 02:06:11.449]  It breaks my heart to see that we continue to spend waste money over in Ukraine when we have so many problems here domestically.
[02:06:11.609 --> 02:06:13.270]  And that's why President Trump won.
[02:06:13.489 --> 02:06:17.529]  So now I do believe that he's going to have to step in there.
[02:06:17.529 --> 02:06:18.210]  By the way, that just broke.
[02:06:18.329 --> 02:06:19.529]  You wanted this an hour ago.
[02:06:19.630 --> 02:06:21.069]  UK, France, small trips to Ukraine.
[02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:22.109]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:06:22.289 --> 02:06:25.149]  I mean, you know, so, yeah, this is unbelievable.
[02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:26.529]  This is moving quickly.
[02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:27.229]  This is moving.
[02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:32.289]  And this gets back to the comment about Secretary Austin, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.
[02:06:32.569 --> 02:06:38.369]  You know, these people think, they tend to think conventionally, or they tend to think, no way in the world is somebody gonna do that.
[02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:40.890]  And I call it the ultimate warning, okay?
[02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:53.289]  Putin sent the world the ultimate warning when he fired those missiles in response to the very provocative offensive attack by the ATACMS into his territory.
[02:06:53.869 --> 02:07:02.069]  Let's show that intermediate-range ballistic missile raining down on that Ukrainian weapons factory depot last Wednesday.
[02:07:02.170 --> 02:07:03.250]  Let's show that on screen for people.
[02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.750]  Go ahead, General.
[02:07:03.869 --> 02:07:05.229]  And that...
[02:07:05.859 --> 02:07:15.760]  That warning, and like I said, it's the ultimate warning because it's not necessarily just a response, a tit for tat, like you call it, right?
[02:07:16.119 --> 02:07:20.060]  This was a warning, and it is a warning to the West, folks.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:24.300]  And guess what the alliance is that's formed against the West?
[02:07:24.439 --> 02:07:26.340]  And the West is really not...
[02:07:26.619 --> 02:07:34.039]  In a place right now, I can tell you our military is definitely not in a place right now to be able to respond to these kinds of activities.
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:44.539]  If we do have to go to a major, major conventional war over in Europe, which we're going to have, we're going to be drawn into it because of, you know, the whole Charter 5 of the NATO charter.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:52.000]  I mean, all of these things, these people are trying to draw us to World War 3. So this is a precious time we have right now, and I'm going to say this.
[02:07:52.319 --> 02:07:55.020]  Let's put the tweet up that Trump just put out yesterday, and I hadn't seen this.
[02:07:55.829 --> 02:08:05.909]  I said, General, two days after they tried to kill Trump on July 13th, I said, next they're going to claim Iran's behind future attacks where they can kill him, blame Iran, and get rid of him and have war.
[02:08:06.329 --> 02:08:09.390]  Trump, you know, criticizing him, but, you know, nobody's perfect.
[02:08:09.729 --> 02:08:11.430]  He comes out and buys into that.
[02:08:11.529 --> 02:08:15.930]  Now he bought into it again, saying, I'm getting total threats that Iran's trying to kill me right now.
[02:08:16.289 --> 02:08:18.029]  Iran has said, no, we don't want to kill you.
[02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:19.189]  We don't want to get into war.
[02:08:20.890 --> 02:08:26.149]  We're good to go.
[02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.350]  I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before.
[02:08:42.609 --> 02:08:46.090]  Thank you to Congress for unanimously approving far more money.
[02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:49.569]  Secret Service, zero, no votes, strictly bipartisan.
[02:08:50.029 --> 02:08:52.609]  Nice to see Republicans and Democrats get together for something.
[02:08:52.810 --> 02:08:56.050]  An attack on a former president is a death wish for an attacker.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.600]  How do you do it?
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:08.399]  So that's a great statement by Trump, and it's a righteous statement, right?
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:10.439]  And he's right to make it.
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:18.199]  Qualities and capabilities and things and such that they put around the capacity to increase the capacity of a security.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:19.340]  Okay, I got all that.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.319]  So how?
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:21.460]  I mean, what would they do?
[02:09:21.699 --> 02:09:24.500]  So obviously, it's like, oh, blame a foreign entity.
[02:09:24.779 --> 02:09:33.520]  So then you have, if in fact something does happen, or if there's even an attempt, then it's like, okay, we point the fingers, it's Iran or it's Russia.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:36.039]  You know, it's going to be somebody over there.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:48.350]  So one of these things that I, this is why I think that, you know, the These assassination attempts that were well known to the American people here, these last two, they got so close.
[02:09:49.909 --> 02:09:56.449]  I mean, when you think about the first two assassination attempts, which have been well reported on, they were able to get so close.
[02:09:56.590 --> 02:10:00.029]  So people don't realize...
[02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:02.289]  Who are the type of people that are behind this?
[02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:03.949]  So there's people inside of our government.
[02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:05.729]  There's people outside of our government.
[02:10:05.909 --> 02:10:16.109]  There are people that are working with overseas partners to make this, and this gets to things like assassination attempts, false flags.
[02:10:16.649 --> 02:10:30.029]  You know, the deception, the ability to narratively project that it's going to be over here when in fact nobody's looking, you know, you go around the right because nobody's looking at the left here, right?
[02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:34.489]  So yeah, it's that sort of bait-and-switch type situation.
[02:10:34.789 --> 02:10:37.529]  ...type attitude that we've got to be careful of.
[02:10:37.609 --> 02:10:46.670]  And I think that there are, because I know that there are people that are former members of the U.S. government that are out there right now, and you've got to watch where they travel around.
[02:10:46.949 --> 02:10:47.189]  John Brennan?
[02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:49.609]  Yeah, nobody ever reports on these guys.
[02:10:49.829 --> 02:10:56.590]  You might see a clip, you might see a, if you're reading the kinds of news outlets and things that I get reports on.
[02:10:57.130 --> 02:11:00.369]  You know, you see, oh, so-and-so showed up in Serbia.
[02:11:00.630 --> 02:11:02.789]  So-and-so showed up in Germany.
[02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:05.989]  And they're having these conversations in these small groups.
[02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:07.770]  And you kind of go, what the hell are these people talking about?
[02:11:07.789 --> 02:11:08.350]  What are they doing?
[02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:11.770]  And are they acting on behalf of the United States government?
[02:11:12.949 --> 02:11:14.649]  And it's easy for those that don't know.
[02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:29.449]  You go out of a multinational corporation through another group, through another group, through another group, fund a government that funds another group, another group, who then funds mercenaries that don't know, and they're told, here's a million bucks, you get 50 million if you kill Trump, then they go hire other subgroups, so there's plenty of plausible liability.
[02:11:29.770 --> 02:11:33.409]  The most important thing right now, right now, is communications.
[02:11:33.810 --> 02:11:39.680]  Open, honest, You know, and brutally honest communications between leaders.
[02:11:39.979 --> 02:11:43.779]  And the leader that we have just elected is President Donald J. Trump.
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:47.560]  President-elect Donald J. Trump gonna be the 47th president of the United States of America, God willing.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:52.319]  And he has got to be able to open up communications lines right now.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:55.380]  Because Joe Biden, we've already seen that he's not gonna do it.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:58.100]  Harris, she's on vacation in wherever.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.500]  And she's incapable of doing it.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:04.100]  I mean, I do believe that- General, what about public statements from Trump?
[02:12:04.279 --> 02:12:20.520]  Because- I think that's a great, great lead for me because one of the things that I have provided, and I think that in President Trump's case,
[02:12:20.739 --> 02:12:25.539]  because we're going into, I call it this sort of season of Thanksgiving, okay?
[02:12:25.979 --> 02:12:32.720]  Thanksgiving is a Nash, it's only celebrated here in the United States of America, okay?
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.560]  A perfect time to call for world peace.
[02:12:34.789 --> 02:12:45.569]  An incredible moment in this historic period of time with a historic victory, a historic person in the presence of Donald J. Trump.
[02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:50.229]  The times that we face, we are in this season of Thanksgiving.
[02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:56.949]  And I believe that right now, and I think Trump can do this because everything that he says is so monitored.
[02:12:57.449 --> 02:12:59.670]  Everybody, every single world leader.
[02:12:59.989 --> 02:13:04.289]  Hell, most of them are on X because of Trump, or they've joined True Social.
[02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:06.609]  They have somebody on True Social because of that.
[02:13:06.909 --> 02:13:20.079]  But any time Trump puts something out, and he does it so smartly, That his messaging, I think, right now has to be so above all of the fray.
[02:13:20.319 --> 02:13:24.159]  So all of us that are out here talking about World War III, we're in the throes of it.
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:28.600]  You know, it's like we want to take this thing, we want to take the decibel levels down.
[02:13:28.659 --> 02:13:38.319]  And the way to do that is really good, open, brutally honest communications that says the right things and talks about how...
[02:13:39.170 --> 02:13:44.390]  I, as the incoming president of the United States of America, here is my agenda.
[02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:48.250]  And my agenda starts with fighting for peace, right?
[02:13:48.569 --> 02:13:51.350]  Building towards peaceful relationships.
[02:13:51.649 --> 02:14:01.909]  Building towards making sure that we are going to act Honestly, maturely, on the world stage, with partners and allies around the world.
[02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:07.869]  I have an agenda that I must, because the American people just demanded it, that I must take care of at home.
[02:14:08.029 --> 02:14:16.109]  But don't think for a second that America is not going to continue to be A great power on the world stage, and we're gonna meet our responsibilities.
[02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:17.449]  We can do all these things.
[02:14:17.569 --> 02:14:27.750]  Donald J. Trump has already proven, with all the craziness that he went through with the Russiagate bullshit, his last administration, he's already proven that he's very, very capable of doing this.
[02:14:27.949 --> 02:14:36.479]  That's why they have to They have to do something to either get rid of this man or to change the nature of the environment.
[02:14:36.699 --> 02:14:38.880]  So he must carpe diem seize the moment.
[02:14:39.079 --> 02:14:40.380]  And again, I'm not criticizing Trump.
[02:14:40.479 --> 02:14:41.720]  I know he's doing shadow diplomacy.
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:45.699]  Rudd's been there, but obviously- And he might be.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.779]  I mean, Alex, as we sit here today, because I know that a lot of people listen to this, a lot.
[02:14:50.889 --> 02:14:55.850]  And I think that Trump is one, and I know he'll see stuff.
[02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:58.270]  And it doesn't have to have Mike Flynn tell him what to do.
[02:14:58.329 --> 02:14:58.989]  He knows what to do.
[02:14:59.029 --> 02:15:00.050]  No, I know that, but I mean...
[02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:07.210]  A week and a half ago, when this all cranked up, we put out the video of him a year ago saying this is going to escalate to World War III. We need to stop this.
[02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.930]  Don't give missiles.
[02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:11.069]  And that was old, and it got hundreds of millions of views.
[02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:13.510]  Literally, on our channel, over hundreds of millions of views, the three versions.
[02:15:13.970 --> 02:15:22.890]  My issue is, and I'm not second-guessing, I'm just saying my listeners and us watching this, we're watching and saying he has this unique power and this position.
[02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:23.869]  I mean...
[02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:29.470]  And maybe he's waiting to write before Thanksgiving, but this is escalating so fast, I'm just on the edge of my seat.
[02:15:29.670 --> 02:15:34.090]  Yeah, and I think that, you know what I was going to say, and I didn't mean to cut into you there.
[02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.649]  No, please.
[02:15:34.789 --> 02:15:46.930]  You know, what I want people to, now I'm really just sort of talking to the wider audience, you know, the audience that is seeing this now or hearing this now on radio, or will see this, you know, as the internet, you know, puts stuff out.
[02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:54.090]  I want people to understand, because I see it every single day, everybody is concerned about what's going on, and what the hell is going on, and anybody doing anything.
[02:15:54.399 --> 02:16:09.720]  So the fact that we're having this very reasonable, very common sense discussion right now about what to do and the kinds of actions that we would want to see out of somebody, some leader of some level, and in this case we're talking about President Donald J. Trump.
[02:16:10.279 --> 02:16:14.039]  The fact that we're doing that, trust me, if we're thinking about it, we're talking about it, and we are.
[02:16:14.579 --> 02:16:15.619]  They're doing the same thing.
[02:16:15.819 --> 02:16:20.520]  So I want the American people to know that there are reasonable people out here.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:26.579]  There are good people with good common sense that understand the situation as it is.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.260]  Trump is not asleep at the switch.
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.180]  He's definitely not.
[02:16:29.359 --> 02:16:33.100]  And he's got his team together.
[02:16:33.819 --> 02:16:35.979]  They've done some great things with their...
[02:16:36.719 --> 02:16:41.760]  With all of their picks for various cabinet choices and working all that.
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:50.079]  And I watched some of the shows yesterday and it looks like he's going to get great support by members of the Senate to confirm everybody that he wants in there.
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:51.639]  And that's all well and good.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.139]  And that's going to continue to move that process along.
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:56.739]  None of that can happen until...
[02:16:56.739 --> 02:16:59.340]  But that makes it even more of a probability they're going to try to kill him.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:00.100]  Exactly.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:00.540]  Exactly.
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:02.020]  Because they're going to see all this.
[02:17:02.559 --> 02:17:03.379]  Always remember...
[02:17:03.930 --> 02:17:07.770]  And in military jargon, we say the enemy has a vote.
[02:17:08.049 --> 02:17:08.469]  Okay?
[02:17:08.649 --> 02:17:10.010]  The enemy has a vote.
[02:17:10.489 --> 02:17:14.610]  And so I stress that the way I said it.
[02:17:14.829 --> 02:17:15.950]  Yeah, they're not going to sit on the sidelines.
[02:17:15.989 --> 02:17:17.489]  They are not going to sit on the sidelines.
[02:17:17.569 --> 02:17:19.450]  They are not sitting on the sidelines.
[02:17:19.569 --> 02:17:24.030]  They are on this field of battle that we are in, sort of metaphorically here.
[02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:28.030]  We are in a wartime environment.
[02:17:28.930 --> 02:17:40.819]  Physical, in the case of what we've been talking about, But this exchange of all these nuclear-capable missiles, the rhetoric that we see, this latest rhetoric coming out of Europe on deployment of troops.
[02:17:41.079 --> 02:17:49.479]  I mean, so all of this matters because the enemies that do exist, these alliances that exist, and this always happens in warfare.
[02:17:50.159 --> 02:17:56.739]  You start to look at the structure and the organizations and the nations, particularly in world wars, right?
[02:17:56.959 --> 02:18:00.479]  You look at the nations that are starting to line up on either side.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:03.559]  That's where I was going next, the North Korean troops.
[02:18:03.879 --> 02:18:05.940]  You think it's true that they're actually in Ukraine?
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.700]  I mean, will China fully come in?
[02:18:07.829 --> 02:18:15.110]  Yeah, I've seen the reports on the North Korean troops, and I've seen, actually one was sent to me the other day that showed that they were just like 100,000.
[02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:17.670]  I don't think, I'm not there yet.
[02:18:17.670 --> 02:18:19.430]  I don't want to believe that yet.
[02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:25.610]  Nobody's been, it's kind of like, you know, an old general, he's deceased now that fought in the Korean War.
[02:18:25.909 --> 02:18:31.909]  He told me, you know, the Chinese were crossing the Yalu River, and he was up there.
[02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:38.350]  He was a company commander up there fighting, and the guys back in the headquarters were saying, hey, there's no Chinese intervening.
[02:18:38.370 --> 02:18:39.889]  He actually got on a helicopter.
[02:18:39.889 --> 02:18:46.610]  He flew up to the front lines, and he captured a Chinaman, and he brought him back and dumped him off at the 8th Army headquarters.
[02:18:46.610 --> 02:18:47.389]  That's like a million of them.
[02:18:47.420 --> 02:18:48.979]  That guy's name was Cavazos.
[02:18:49.159 --> 02:18:49.520]  He's great.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.639]  He was a legend.
[02:18:51.879 --> 02:18:55.239]  But he did it to say, hey, there's Chinese.
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.040]  We're fighting the Chinese, right?
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:58.059]  He's like, here's one.
[02:18:58.479 --> 02:18:58.700]  Right.
[02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:03.979]  So what we have to, you know, again, we're going to pay very close attention to these things.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:12.120]  If there are, in fact, North Korean troops being brought in, that just shows you, because North Korea doesn't do anything unless China says to do it.
[02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:14.129]  And, you know, so we'll see.
[02:19:14.610 --> 02:19:16.629]  I'm not there yet with the North Korean troops.
[02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:19.149]  Are there advisors?
[02:19:19.770 --> 02:19:27.590]  The North has, North Korea now has nuclear-capable systems, weapon systems, that are very good.
[02:19:27.729 --> 02:19:29.510]  And we have to be conscious of that.
[02:19:29.670 --> 02:19:32.670]  So this is China through North Korea sticking its toe in the water?
[02:19:32.909 --> 02:19:33.930]  This is China.
[02:19:34.090 --> 02:19:35.190]  This is China, okay?
[02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:40.610]  Everything is, this century, folks, we're in the third decade of it, everything is about China.
[02:19:41.659 --> 02:19:55.799]  Their plan is to be, and it's very soon, that's why Xi has declared himself president for life, is everything is about becoming the world superpower, the number one world superpower this century, and they're already on the march.
[02:19:55.959 --> 02:20:00.360]  Had we lost this last election, by 2030, we'd be done.
[02:20:01.159 --> 02:20:02.379]  And I said earlier that...
[02:20:02.379 --> 02:20:04.260]  And the State Department is saying North Koreans are now...
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:05.700]  At least on the border.
[02:20:06.079 --> 02:20:06.680]  Stay right there, General.
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:07.340]  Let me interrupt you.
[02:20:07.479 --> 02:20:11.500]  We're going to take a few calls and comments on spaces coming up with General Flynn.
[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:15.260]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:20:15.799 --> 02:20:19.120]  First-time callers, quick questions or comments for General Flynn.
[02:20:19.219 --> 02:20:20.020]  We're going to move to the next person.
[02:20:20.579 --> 02:20:22.780]  877-789-2539.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.559]  877-789-2539.
[02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:30.430]  We'll take five or six questions on the phones and five or six questions on Xpaces.
[02:20:30.709 --> 02:20:31.709]  There's a limited time.
[02:20:31.909 --> 02:20:33.110]  We're just going to go to you quickly.
[02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:35.129]  And General Flynn, you're so gracious to come to town.
[02:20:35.329 --> 02:20:39.350]  I heard, I haven't asked you in person yet, are you going to be able to go in the war room today with Owen?
[02:20:39.850 --> 02:20:40.950]  I can if he's here.
[02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.829]  Oh, he's here.
[02:20:41.989 --> 02:20:43.250]  He would love to have you, by the way.
[02:20:43.809 --> 02:20:44.909]  Yeah, I have a little bit of time.
[02:20:45.049 --> 02:20:45.709]  How long are you here?
[02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:50.850]  I actually have a flight out of here later this afternoon, so early evening.
[02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:53.340]  We're out of the airport, get you some lunch too.
[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:53.959]  Yeah, the airport's right here.
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:56.680]  GeneralFlynn.com, GeneralFlynn.com.
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:21:00.819]  Owen should have front and center in the new Washington press room there.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:01.639]  We'll be back.
[02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:11.049]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health.
[02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:16.889]  Not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[02:21:16.930 --> 02:21:17.809]  It's just all around us.
[02:21:18.229 --> 02:21:21.149]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.770]  Bill Gates.
[02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:30.059]  Is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[02:21:30.239 --> 02:21:30.879]  It's insane.
[02:21:31.079 --> 02:21:37.280]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:46.219]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby.
[02:21:46.479 --> 02:21:48.079]  Ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:21:49.059 --> 02:21:51.399]  These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:54.260]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:58.500]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[02:21:59.399 --> 02:22:00.479]  This is amazing.
[02:22:00.479 --> 02:22:01.860]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:09.399]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[02:22:10.209 --> 02:22:11.229]  Pro-prostate.
[02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:22.010]  Because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[02:22:22.170 --> 02:22:24.489]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands.
[02:22:24.649 --> 02:22:27.790]  But even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is...
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:28.500]  Insane.
[02:22:28.579 --> 02:22:28.940]  Look it up.
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.420]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[02:22:31.739 --> 02:22:33.639]  It's got the trifecta going.
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:54.819]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, and you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:15.190]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:23:15.409 --> 02:23:17.610]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:18.350]  Go!
[02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:24.729]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:23:37.450 --> 02:23:39.889]  General Flynn's with us another 30 minutes.
[02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:42.770]  We're about to take your calls and a few ex-spaces comments.
[02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:45.510]  General Flynn and I were just talking during the break.
[02:23:45.629 --> 02:23:49.750]  There's constant, biggest cyber attacks ever on telecommunications, airlines.
[02:23:50.549 --> 02:23:55.610]  They've caught, I think, that Chinese ship last week cutting cables in the Baltic Sea.
[02:23:56.069 --> 02:24:00.209]  General, this is when World War III is already in its first phases.
[02:24:00.209 --> 02:24:02.989]  It's rolling out, but I hope we don't wake up dead.
[02:24:03.569 --> 02:24:12.829]  You know, one of the things that's interesting in warfare, you look at is command and control, communications, you know, we'll call them C4ISR systems, right?
[02:24:13.129 --> 02:24:22.010]  And, you know, when you start to think about the world of cyber as an event, and I think that we probably are experiencing one right now.
[02:24:22.170 --> 02:24:24.530]  I just got, you know, and I think it's breaking, but...
[02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:34.190]  Because we've been getting reports about particular outages in Florida, of course, which is where Donald Trump is at right now with his team.
[02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:36.549]  So how bad it is, I don't know.
[02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:38.069]  I'm not going to speculate.
[02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:42.989]  But when you start to really look at how to...
[02:24:44.489 --> 02:24:47.030]  Understand your enemies' capabilities.
[02:24:47.350 --> 02:24:48.909]  You monitor them, right?
[02:24:49.010 --> 02:24:50.469]  You're gonna listen to what they're talking about.
[02:24:50.530 --> 02:24:52.209]  You're gonna watch what they're doing.
[02:24:52.430 --> 02:25:08.149]  You're gonna take stock in how they're positioning their resources, whether it's our nuclear arsenal or whether it's other forces that are at places like Fort Bragg or Fort Hood, and those are the old names, but I'll stick with those.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:12.219]  From a military perspective, what is the Department of Defense doing?
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:16.540]  Are all the lights on at the Department of Defense right now, and are they gonna be on through?
[02:25:16.819 --> 02:25:17.879]  And the answer is, yeah.
[02:25:18.379 --> 02:25:19.799]  Is there constant planning?
[02:25:20.079 --> 02:25:22.719]  And the answer is that, yeah, there should be constant.
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:26.700]  And we need to look at all of the different things that are happening around the world.
[02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:28.250]  The cutting of the cable.
[02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:31.690]  This particular report now about Microsoft.
[02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:34.229]  These are big organizations.
[02:25:34.969 --> 02:25:36.170]  The other thing is banking.
[02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:41.549]  I think that the banking industry has got to be another part of what is happening.
[02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:46.329]  There's been a lot of talk from the BRICS nations about this shift to a digital currency.
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:52.319]  And whether or not the United States is going to do that, Donald J. Trump has had some ideas about what he wants to do.
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:55.159]  We'll see what they end up with doing.
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:58.059]  As you said, the Microsoft global outage right now.
[02:25:58.299 --> 02:25:58.299]  Yeah.
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.020]  So, okay.
[02:26:00.159 --> 02:26:01.260]  So how does that happen?
[02:26:01.399 --> 02:26:02.260]  What is it affecting?
[02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:15.420]  What are the things that, you know, when we look at warfare and we look at what an enemy is doing, is an enemy looking at how you are responding to this outage?
[02:26:15.659 --> 02:26:16.059]  Probes.
[02:26:16.379 --> 02:26:18.819]  Yeah, it's like reconnaissance.
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:20.059]  You're probing the line.
[02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:32.819]  You're actively maneuvering out there on the physical, the cyber, the domains of warfare, and you're probing to see what kind of response mechanisms does your opponent have.
[02:26:32.979 --> 02:26:34.959]  Are they capable of responding?
[02:26:34.959 --> 02:26:49.079]  If there is a Absolutely.
[02:27:00.989 --> 02:27:03.190]  Crazily focused on this DEI stuff.
[02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:15.409]  So, you know, I mean, there is a, you know, I pulled this thing the other day from a friend and I had a conversation about sort of this summary of the multi-front war that we're facing.
[02:27:15.409 --> 02:27:20.750]  You know, as kinetic as we've been talking about, it's chemical biological warfare, right?
[02:27:20.850 --> 02:27:23.209]  Those are the kinds of weapon systems that we have seen, right?
[02:27:23.290 --> 02:27:27.590]  The use of biological weapons in the whole COVID, right?
[02:27:27.729 --> 02:27:28.870]  The truth is we're in a...
[02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:32.290]  Undeclared, fifth-generational global war right now.
[02:27:32.329 --> 02:27:35.370]  Big time, and I've read a book about it.
[02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:37.270]  We've been talking about this for a couple of years.
[02:27:37.709 --> 02:27:42.969]  It began even without the advent of this exchange of these nuclear-capable missiles.
[02:27:43.809 --> 02:27:48.850]  There's a cultural component, there's an economic component, there's a legal component, there's clearly cyber.
[02:27:48.989 --> 02:27:50.209]  We're talking about it right now.
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:28:02.659]  And then there's a demographic component, because I think that one of the things that people don't, they misunderstand is the way and the nature that the world has shifted in the last probably 25 years.
[02:28:02.979 --> 02:28:05.239]  China is at the forefront of that shift.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:12.500]  When you're talking about 1.4, 1.5 billion people, you look at a country like India, I think it's 1.3, 1.4 billion people.
[02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:19.809]  You know, you add in a couple of others that are within an alliance that the Chinese have worked very, very hard to bring together.
[02:28:20.129 --> 02:28:24.889]  You know, like, you know, you've got, I mean, Iran is in there.
[02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:28.770]  We've talked about Venezuela, North Korea, of course, Russia and China.
[02:28:28.889 --> 02:28:31.069]  But you have other countries like Syria, Bolivia.
[02:28:31.399 --> 02:28:34.700]  You know, you got to look at these non-state actors.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:35.739]  We still have al-Qaeda.
[02:28:35.879 --> 02:28:39.239]  We still have ISIS. We still have the Taliban, who we have been funding.
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.760]  We continue to fund the Taliban after we were beaten by them.
[02:28:44.899 --> 02:28:48.500]  We retreated and had, you know, just the tragedy of leaving Afghanistan.
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:49.639]  And the borders have been wide open.
[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:50.940]  Pakistan.
[02:28:51.079 --> 02:28:55.420]  Pakistan is another country, a nuclear-capable country that is there.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:59.639]  And Pakistan's relationship with the Chinese goes back to the mid-'50s.
[02:28:59.739 --> 02:29:03.899]  So there are these alliances that we have to start to look at.
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:10.000]  And the administration that we have right now, this Sleep at the Switch administration, is a very dangerous administration.
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:11.860]  Is he just looting money from Ukraine?
[02:29:12.079 --> 02:29:13.680]  They have been destroying this country.
[02:29:15.199 --> 02:29:27.680]  Intentionally, and they've been doing it by allowing these millions and millions of illegals to come in here and basically destroy the fabric of our country educationally, healthcare-wise, the criminal actions on the streets of America.
[02:29:27.979 --> 02:29:36.180]  It's absolute insanity, and that's one of the big agenda items that Trump got elected on, re-elected on, and is going to have to go in and have to take care of.
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:44.860]  All of that that is happening, you have these different countries that are coming together and the Chinese are behind every bit of it.
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:53.940]  And you have actors, people inside of our own government that kind of wander around the world And you see them out there.
[02:29:54.159 --> 02:30:04.780]  I mentioned a few, but like the John Kerry's, John Brennan, Jim Clapper, the current director of the CIA is an interesting character.
[02:30:04.959 --> 02:30:21.190]  He still goes around there and does all these diplomatic things when you wonder why do they have the CIA director doing things when we have a State Department and ambassadors that are supposed to be negotiating diplomatic Issues between nations.
[02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:23.930]  So we have all of these organizations.
[02:30:24.370 --> 02:30:25.950]  You see the United Nations.
[02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:27.610]  I'm not a big fan of the United Nations.
[02:30:28.409 --> 02:30:33.969]  I really don't see much that the United Nations has really done for world peace.
[02:30:34.149 --> 02:30:35.270]  I don't think they've done much.
[02:30:35.610 --> 02:30:37.409]  Then you have all these other world organizations.
[02:30:37.809 --> 02:30:41.290]  World Health Organization, World Bank, World Trade, International Monetary Fund.
[02:30:41.489 --> 02:30:44.229]  So you have these other organizations that are out there.
[02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:50.069]  And I think that what people need to understand is that The majority of them are anti-American.
[02:30:50.450 --> 02:31:05.569]  And so when we have people in our own government who have this anti-American or certainly anti-constitutional bent, because had Kamala Harris won, and I want to remind everybody, had Kamala Harris won, because we all want to be benevolent, we all want to be, you know,
[02:31:05.649 --> 02:31:11.469]  when the fight's over with, we want to hug each other and go, okay, it was a great fight, back to our corners, and No.
[02:31:11.469 --> 02:31:14.110]  This is about ultimate power.
[02:31:14.350 --> 02:31:17.930]  Had Kamala Harris won, Donald Trump would be going to jail the 26th of this month.
[02:31:17.930 --> 02:31:19.809]  It's an existential, we're in a death battle.
[02:31:20.809 --> 02:31:21.170]  Exactly.
[02:31:21.489 --> 02:31:22.530]  General, we're almost out of time.
[02:31:22.569 --> 02:31:24.389]  I want to take a few phone calls for you.
[02:31:24.969 --> 02:31:29.950]  We're going to go, you're so gracious to be, you're going to be popping in before you get to the airport the first 30 minutes with new breaking news.
[02:31:30.129 --> 02:31:33.770]  A lot will happen the next hour and 15 minutes with Owen Schroer at 3 p.m.
[02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:34.610]  Central for 30 minutes.
[02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:39.569]  You'll have more for people then, obviously, to get to everything today, but we appreciate you coming to town just for this.
[02:31:40.049 --> 02:31:42.010]  Let's go to a caller in Michigan first.
[02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:43.829]  Let's talk to Justin in Michigan.
[02:31:43.829 --> 02:31:44.829]  You're on the air with General Flynn.
[02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:45.469]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:49.590]  Good evening to you, Alex and General Flynn.
[02:31:50.389 --> 02:32:12.729]  General Flynn, from a first principles perspective, what foundational measures should the United States adopt in the lead-up to the inauguration to start the path to World War III? Especially in light of the recent use of US missiles by Ukraine against Russia, how can we fundamentally rethink our approach to international relations to ensure we're not sleepwalking into a broader conflict?
[02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:15.920]  I think he answered that question last Saturday night, just in a recap.
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:23.059]  Yeah, I mean, quickly, it's opening up the communications lines, and I think Donald J. Trump is going to have to do that here very soon.
[02:32:23.299 --> 02:32:24.500]  He's going to have to get a message.
[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:30.879]  Yeah, who's in charge when they admit, both in Russia and here, that Russia wants to talk to us and the hotline has gone unused for years?
[02:32:30.879 --> 02:32:31.719]  That is criminal.
[02:32:32.059 --> 02:32:32.299]  Right.
[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:33.420]  Probably doesn't even exist.
[02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:35.940]  All right, Justin, does that answer your question?
[02:32:35.959 --> 02:32:36.120]  Thank you.
[02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.989]  Yes, it does.
[02:32:38.170 --> 02:32:38.389]  Thank you.
[02:32:38.489 --> 02:32:39.030]  I appreciate your time.
[02:32:39.129 --> 02:32:39.469]  Thank you.
[02:32:40.209 --> 02:32:42.409]  Yeah, I mean, everybody needs to share this live feed.
[02:32:42.729 --> 02:32:47.809]  It's all going to be archived the next hour on X. Share this like your future depends on it, because it does.
[02:32:47.969 --> 02:32:49.450]  This is real expertise we had here today.
[02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:52.069]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:54.790]  Let's go ahead and talk to a caller in Ohio.
[02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:56.750]  Danny, you're on the air with General Michael Flynn.
[02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:57.149]  Go ahead.
[02:32:58.930 --> 02:33:00.010]  How you doing, Mr. Flynn?
[02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:00.610]  How you doing, sir?
[02:33:00.729 --> 02:33:01.270]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:33:01.430 --> 02:33:01.549]  Good.
[02:33:01.629 --> 02:33:01.829]  Go ahead.
[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:04.239]  Got a question for you.
[02:33:04.420 --> 02:33:09.680]  Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution requires that our government to protect and defend our borders.
[02:33:10.079 --> 02:33:14.379]  How in the world has not Biden been removed when he's letting these illegal people in here?
[02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:18.420]  Now we got, like you were just saying, people not in government still.
[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:28.540]  How are they not violating the Logan Act, and how are they going to combat that when they just fiddle-faddle around with all this stuff and not go after people under rules of engagement like they're supposed to?
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:29.479]  Thank you.
[02:33:29.850 --> 02:33:41.329]  Yeah, so briefly, I mean, you know, that question should have been resolved when Congress took over, when the Republicans took over Congress two years ago, or just under two years ago now.
[02:33:41.530 --> 02:33:49.450]  So, yeah, I mean, that's why, where we're at now, I have said that we should, you know, that Harris should...
[02:33:49.469 --> 02:33:53.590]  Should either pull the 25th amendment or Congress needs to start impeachment proceedings.
[02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:56.909]  There are two congressmen that have written up impeachment proceedings.
[02:33:57.409 --> 02:33:59.909]  Self out of Texas and then Massey.
[02:34:00.649 --> 02:34:01.709]  And we'll see.
[02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:02.649]  We'll see what they do.
[02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:10.969]  We cannot have the destruction of our country, intentional destruction of our country, by allowing and opening up our borders.
[02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:12.270]  It's just insane.
[02:34:12.489 --> 02:34:13.870]  And that's what's happening to our country.
[02:34:14.010 --> 02:34:15.930]  And that's why Donald Trump got reelected.
[02:34:15.989 --> 02:34:31.370]  It's one of the principal reasons why he got reelected was to get his domestic agenda in place immediately and get Tom Holman, give Tom Holman the resources that he needs as the face of it to stop this madness and get our country back to where we feel safe and secure once again.
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:41.600]  This should have been taken care of a year and a half ago by Congress when we gave Congress the mandated victory when the Republicans took over.
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.559]  And they haven't done anything.
[02:34:42.659 --> 02:34:45.020]  All they actually have done is given more money to Ukraine.
[02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:47.430]  Thank you, sir, for the call.
[02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:49.950]  And I noticed the callers, they're all great, but they're asking the same question.
[02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:52.090]  How do we stop this madness?
[02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:58.170]  It's just, I mean, we have to get these crazies out, and we are about to get them out.
[02:34:58.250 --> 02:34:59.290]  That's why they're doing this.
[02:34:59.370 --> 02:35:00.530]  This is desperate.
[02:35:00.649 --> 02:35:06.190]  Is there any way for Trump to directly communicate with the deep state and then publicly expose them and just say...
[02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:08.510]  We all know you're behind this.
[02:35:08.629 --> 02:35:13.809]  We all know you're trying to start World War III to keep me from getting into office or hand me a disaster, as Don Jr. said.
[02:35:14.049 --> 02:35:16.389]  Yeah, I think just what you just said.
[02:35:16.989 --> 02:35:20.290]  If Donald, because we all recognize this.
[02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:26.229]  I mean, those of us that are paying attention, the American people, the God-given common sense that the American people have, they all see it.
[02:35:26.370 --> 02:35:29.010]  What we need to hear is we need to hear...
[02:35:29.629 --> 02:35:33.510]  That message coming from the person that we have elected.
[02:35:33.850 --> 02:35:39.030]  So I don't want to put pressure on them, but we are in a place right now where...
[02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:43.530]  And I'm not going to sit here and say that I don't get hyperbolic sometimes.
[02:35:43.530 --> 02:35:44.069]  I do.
[02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:50.510]  Because I have lived a life of thinking, fighting these enemies that we have.
[02:35:50.629 --> 02:35:53.190]  And now the worst enemy that we have is right here at home.
[02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:55.129]  And so that's the deep state.
[02:35:55.819 --> 02:35:58.620]  Fourth branch of government, fifth column, whatever you want to call them.
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:07.799]  General, have you ever in your lifetime seen an existential crisis with this global realignment, the desperate establishment, putting a nuclear gun to our head as we now are in?
[02:36:07.959 --> 02:36:08.959]  No, I never have.
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:09.940]  I've never seen it.
[02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:16.659]  And I've studied the world in U.S. history, and I have not seen this kind of existential threat to the United States of America.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:27.049]  And the United States of America has not been through an existential threat like this We're good to go.
[02:36:44.430 --> 02:36:47.709]  The momentum is in the American people's hands.
[02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:52.350]  So those that are listening, call your congressmen up, right?
[02:36:52.549 --> 02:36:57.170]  Your congressmen are about to come home on a little break for Thanksgiving.
[02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:59.129]  Go call them out.
[02:36:59.290 --> 02:37:00.350]  Call them out, folks.
[02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:03.409]  I mean, you've got districts all over this country, 435 of them.
[02:37:03.629 --> 02:37:06.790]  Let's call these people out and tell them, hey, we're not...
[02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:09.090]  We don't think that you're doing enough.
[02:37:09.270 --> 02:37:10.430]  And tell them to do more.
[02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:11.309]  And I think that's where...
[02:37:11.909 --> 02:37:23.309]  I think from President Trump's perspective and his national security team, and the only real one that can talk right now is his national security advisor because he's the only one that doesn't need confirmation and he's in the job.
[02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:25.329]  Same position you had.
[02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:26.469]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:26.909 --> 02:37:28.049]  All right, we're almost out of time.
[02:37:28.770 --> 02:37:31.209]  Let's take a X Spaces commenter.
[02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:36.489]  Chase Geiser's in there running the X Spaces on the Mighty X. And Chase, who are we going to go to here?
[02:37:37.829 --> 02:37:39.590]  Let's go to Tara Reid.
[02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:41.850]  Tara Reid, if you're still with us, thank you for holding for so long.
[02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:42.569]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:44.149]  Oh, hi.
[02:37:45.010 --> 02:37:47.649]  General Flynn, a huge honor to speak with you.
[02:37:47.770 --> 02:37:49.850]  And Alex Jones, I am such a fan of yours.
[02:37:50.069 --> 02:37:52.090]  You just keep being the warrior that you are.
[02:37:53.549 --> 02:37:55.229]  General Flynn, I had a question.
[02:37:55.389 --> 02:38:01.309]  You know, I worked for Leon Panetta and for Joe Biden in the past, and now I'm under political asylum in Russia.
[02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:03.149]  I won't get into my personal story.
[02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:05.770]  I wanted to stay on topic here because we are running out of time.
[02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:16.770]  But my question was, there's a lot of talk about people, like you mentioned, people you don't see out front, like Jamie Rubin, who's actually in the president's ear in the administration, very hawk-like.
[02:38:16.930 --> 02:38:18.629]  He was brought up by Madeleine Albright.
[02:38:19.069 --> 02:38:21.350]  They're talking about limited nuclear war.
[02:38:21.430 --> 02:38:23.409]  That's how they're trying to manufacture consent.
[02:38:23.969 --> 02:38:32.250]  Can you talk a little bit, educate people who might not know how dire that is and how scary that is and limited nuclear war and what they mean?
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:37.100]  Yeah, thank you, Tara, and I appreciate the call and you being part of what you're doing.
[02:38:37.819 --> 02:38:40.600]  Yeah, there is going to be a narrative.
[02:38:40.799 --> 02:38:46.260]  The left and their minions, they're very good about creating a narrative.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:55.200]  There is no such thing as, when you use the word nuclear, okay, there's no such thing as limited and there's no such thing as tactical, okay?
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:39:03.520]  Once the genie is out of the bottle, once the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, There's nuclear-capable nations all over the world.
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:07.659]  It creates a literal and figurative chain reaction.
[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:10.239]  And so now what do you do?
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:17.940]  And what it does is it opens the door for the globalists who want to come in and start a massive war with Russia.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:20.680]  And what does that get us?
[02:39:20.739 --> 02:39:21.780]  It gets us nowhere.
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:22.940]  It gets more killing.
[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:25.260]  It's gonna destroy a lot of things.
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:28.639]  It's gonna cost the American people.
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:38.610]  So from a U.S., from an American perspective, It's going to cost this country possibly the existence of our nation as it is.
[02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:41.690]  Well, don't most of the war games say it never stays limited?
[02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:43.190]  It never does.
[02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:44.069]  Yeah, it never does.
[02:39:44.350 --> 02:39:45.989]  And frankly, we always lose them.
[02:39:46.090 --> 02:39:50.809]  I mean, you know, a lot of the exercises that we go through when we do these things, we end up losing the damn thing.
[02:39:50.930 --> 02:39:54.329]  So I think from Russia's perspective...
[02:39:54.629 --> 02:40:08.510]  I mean, I think that they would welcome some sensible discussion or a statement out of the incoming president of the United States.
[02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:09.290]  I believe that.
[02:40:09.329 --> 02:40:10.309]  I just firmly believe that.
[02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:11.069]  Absolutely.
[02:40:11.329 --> 02:40:13.149]  And all these people that are going to go, well, there's Putin puppets.
[02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:13.889]  Screw you.
[02:40:14.069 --> 02:40:17.069]  This is not about being somebody's puppet or whatever.
[02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:20.450]  And they'll use these narratives, as Tara is highlighting.
[02:40:20.549 --> 02:40:23.270]  They use these terms, limited nuclear objectives.
[02:40:23.770 --> 02:40:24.209]  Baloney.
[02:40:24.329 --> 02:40:27.450]  Oh, they've had Hollywood idiots like Sean Penn with The Talking Point.
[02:40:27.659 --> 02:40:29.299]  We should have nuclear war on the table.
[02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:30.620]  We shouldn't be scared to use it.
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:32.760]  They're literally pushing that as a talking point.
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:34.399]  It's terrible.
[02:40:34.639 --> 02:40:43.299]  It's what I said earlier, and Tara, I don't know if you caught that, but what I said is it is a controlled military commitment.
[02:40:43.479 --> 02:40:59.500]  When I use the phrase controlled military commitment, that means that those here, those in the deep state, those in this administration, they think that they can have a controlled military action Without having an effect or an impact here in the United States of America,
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:03.440]  that is, to me, that is crazy, crazy thinking.
[02:41:03.639 --> 02:41:04.379]  And let's speak to that.
[02:41:05.079 --> 02:41:10.819]  Two months ago, Keir Starmer said, Biden is about to start bombing with attackums.
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:11.860]  We're going to use storm shadows.
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:13.360]  There's a diplomatic...
[02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:22.090]  He runs over and meets with Biden, and then the New York Times said Biden agreed that they could be used, but he doesn't want the U.S. to be blamed.
[02:41:22.590 --> 02:41:23.750]  That's the same thinking.
[02:41:23.889 --> 02:41:31.190]  You can attack Russia with nuclear-capable missiles, and then you want a policy like blowing up Nord Stream where you don't get the blame.
[02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:32.850]  That is delusional.
[02:41:32.989 --> 02:41:35.489]  It's big-time delusional, and, you know...
[02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:39.889]  When somebody says, okay, we can do this, well, what will be their response?
[02:41:40.069 --> 02:41:40.829]  Well, they wouldn't fire.
[02:41:40.969 --> 02:41:45.409]  Like Lloyd Austin, we talked about Lloyd Austin, Secretary Lloyd Austin a little while ago.
[02:41:45.549 --> 02:41:49.389]  Well, if they did use them, they're not going to fire something into the United States of America.
[02:41:49.649 --> 02:41:58.030]  You know what we'd have to do to tool our entire nuclear system, our entire nuclear process, to get it back to where it's ready again?
[02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:01.850]  I mean, go back a couple of years and look at the reports on some of these nuclear...
[02:42:01.850 --> 02:42:02.270]  It's falling apart.
[02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:03.850]  It's falling apart, folks.
[02:42:04.090 --> 02:42:05.270]  And then Putin just proved they're not.
[02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:08.850]  So we're almost out of time here, General.
[02:42:09.629 --> 02:42:13.850]  We're on the edge of oblivion here, or on the edge of a wonderful new future.
[02:42:13.989 --> 02:42:15.229]  It's so paradoxical.
[02:42:15.309 --> 02:42:15.610]  It is.
[02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:19.670]  I mean, it's an existential, I call it an arc of history.
[02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:23.250]  An arc of history, you can either go one way, Or the other.
[02:42:23.430 --> 02:42:26.430]  And what we want is we want a peaceful transition of power.
[02:42:26.590 --> 02:42:30.489]  We want to get President Donald J. Trump, who just won a huge mandate, into office.
[02:42:30.649 --> 02:42:35.350]  We want him to be able to attack his agenda and make sure that his agenda gets pushed through.
[02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:46.389]  There's going to be all of the political nonsense that they're going to try, but we want to have that ability to be able to get our country back on the rails, folks, because right now our country is off the rails.
[02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.549]  That's right.
[02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:48.229]  We want to battle to get Trump...
[02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:51.270]  President-elect, but the real war is getting him in and then draining the swamp.
[02:42:51.370 --> 02:42:51.989]  People need to understand.
[02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:56.950]  It's like I said, and I know we're going to run out of time, but it's like I said the day after the election.
[02:42:57.250 --> 02:42:58.909]  This is D-Day plus one.
[02:42:59.049 --> 02:43:00.809]  We have attacked the beaches of Normandy.
[02:43:00.909 --> 02:43:03.829]  We're up on the cliffs now.
[02:43:03.829 --> 02:43:07.190]  We've broken through the hedgerows, but this is only, this is D-Day plus one.
[02:43:07.270 --> 02:43:08.790]  We cannot declare victory over Europe.
[02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:10.649]  Because Zeb Dietrich and the Battle of the Bulge is coming.
[02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.510]  Exactly.
[02:43:11.989 --> 02:43:12.389]  Exactly.
[02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:13.350]  And it's coming.
[02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:14.010]  It's coming.
[02:43:14.479 --> 02:43:15.239]  I think it's here.
[02:43:15.579 --> 02:43:15.659]  Yeah.
[02:43:16.879 --> 02:43:18.379]  Notice they want us to sleepwalk.
[02:43:18.899 --> 02:43:19.260]  Yeah.
[02:43:19.979 --> 02:43:23.219]  I mean, they even know the general government, even the most politicians will understand this.
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:31.340]  What do you think, briefly, I mean, we know who the people are, but in the deep state, who's the most powerful operatives?
[02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:40.149]  Blinken, the current CIA director, because they admit they're making these decisions How do we legally, lawfully, nonviolently put heat on them?
[02:43:40.329 --> 02:43:40.610]  Right.
[02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:42.629]  Well, I mean, right now it's Congress.
[02:43:42.850 --> 02:43:52.329]  I mean, that's what we have in our system is we have Congress to be able to, and Speaker Johnson, who has extraordinary authority to be able to do things.
[02:43:52.979 --> 02:44:00.059]  And honestly, President Donald J. Trump, President-elect Donald J. Trump, has extraordinary, I think it's referent power right now.
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:06.700]  He's got a mandate, and he's a proven leader as President of the United States of America already.
[02:44:06.899 --> 02:44:10.700]  It's not like we're guessing on what this guy could do or might be.
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:16.159]  He's already done some incredible things for this nation and kept us out of war.
[02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:25.090]  Well, I know you talk to him, and I've talked to folks that are, they say he's working on this, but obviously, It's just seconds or days and months now.
[02:44:25.489 --> 02:44:26.889]  I'm going to do this right now, General Flynn.
[02:44:26.989 --> 02:44:27.389]  Stay right there.
[02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:29.430]  And you're going to be on for the first 30 minutes of the war, and then you've got to go.
[02:44:29.569 --> 02:44:32.090]  So that's coming up in about an hour and five minutes from now, very graciously.
[02:44:33.149 --> 02:44:33.950]  I'm going to say this.
[02:44:33.969 --> 02:44:36.750]  We're going to stop this World War III. I believe God's going to move in here.
[02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:37.690]  He already gave us Trump.
[02:44:38.129 --> 02:44:39.129]  We're going to expose this.
[02:44:39.209 --> 02:44:40.350]  You're going to share this live feed.
[02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:41.190]  You're going to share the clips.
[02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:43.049]  We're going to reach tens of millions more people.
[02:44:43.649 --> 02:44:48.790]  But separately, if we don't take care of what we're doing here, this operation won't be here.
[02:44:48.889 --> 02:44:51.190]  General Flynn does all this on his own tirelessly.
[02:44:51.850 --> 02:44:57.090]  We're out here really effectively in the information warfare space with the truth, countering their lies.
[02:44:57.450 --> 02:44:58.510]  There is a war on for the mind.
[02:44:59.049 --> 02:45:04.930]  Elon Musk is coming to my aid, filing a lawsuit trying to block my ex-account being given to the Democrats and this whole Bloomberg front group.
[02:45:05.229 --> 02:45:08.370]  And there's some cavalry coming, but I'm funded by you.
[02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:14.379]  And so I'm so focused on this and in the World War III that I've not been up here really infomercialing.
[02:45:14.479 --> 02:45:17.479]  Like, I need to fund this because this takes a lot of money to do.
[02:45:17.559 --> 02:45:19.139]  The satellites, the servers, the lawyers.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:20.579]  I've held off the globalists.
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:22.840]  They've spent almost $80 million trying to shut us down.
[02:45:22.899 --> 02:45:25.540]  We've spent $16 million in the last seven years holding them off.
[02:45:26.459 --> 02:45:27.559]  Flynn's been through the ringer.
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:28.860]  And we're warriors.
[02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:29.479]  We'll do it.
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:30.639]  We love fighting the enemy.
[02:45:30.739 --> 02:45:31.579]  We expect this.
[02:45:31.659 --> 02:45:32.579]  We're not whining.
[02:45:32.700 --> 02:45:33.500]  We signed off for this.
[02:45:33.659 --> 02:45:35.559]  But you're the other ingredient.
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:54.079]  You are the variable sharing the articles, praying for us, spreading the word, taking the clips, and going to GeneralFlynn.com and get a ball cap, get a t-shirt, get his great fifth-generational warfare books, support him, get his new incredible film that documents what really happened,
[02:45:54.159 --> 02:45:56.639]  gives you a greater understanding of the deep state and leadership and how to fight it.
[02:45:57.700 --> 02:45:58.200]  Go there.
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:00.059]  He's a humble guy who doesn't ask for the support.
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:02.299]  I know he is doing everything he can.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.059]  Same with InfoWars.
[02:46:04.219 --> 02:46:05.639]  Go to the Alex SchoenStore.com.
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:14.739]  Whatever happens to InfoWars, that's an outside sponsor with supplements and ball caps and t-shirts and the same type of stuff that spreads the word, that makes your life better.
[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:16.700]  CMOS is an incredible superfood.
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:19.760]  We've got our great HydroForce with all the vitamins and minerals and great electrolytes.
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:22.899]  Just things you need, high quality, that keep us on the air.
[02:46:23.059 --> 02:46:24.360]  I cannot do it.
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:25.219]  People thank me all day.
[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:27.500]  Well, I want to thank those of you that have supported the past.
[02:46:27.819 --> 02:46:29.239]  Look how far we've come.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:31.120]  So you're putting the cart before the horse.
[02:46:31.239 --> 02:46:33.040]  It's you that share the articles.
[02:46:33.139 --> 02:46:34.719]  It's you that share the videos.
[02:46:34.819 --> 02:46:36.159]  It's you that give us the intel.
[02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:40.459]  It's you that fund us to stay in the fight for all of our collective future.
[02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:43.319]  So go now to thealishjonesstore.com.
[02:46:43.799 --> 02:46:46.639]  I want to thank those that get a limited edition poster.
[02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:47.819]  Yeah, there's a markup there.
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:49.620]  Well, posters cost like six, seven bucks.
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:50.100]  Yeah, I know.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:54.120]  It's 50 bucks and one's 30 bucks because we need real funds to fight these people.
[02:46:54.239 --> 02:46:55.639]  If you really want to support, do that.
[02:46:55.819 --> 02:46:58.219]  Not much markup in the t-shirts and the supplements.
[02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:00.139]  So go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:02.149]  And support today.
[02:47:02.649 --> 02:47:04.030]  All of this is capable.
[02:47:04.350 --> 02:47:06.750]  All of this is happening because of you.
[02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:15.149]  Look in the mirror and thank yourself for your past support and support again and go to generalflynn.com and follow him on X as well.
[02:47:15.250 --> 02:47:16.170]  General, thank you so much.
[02:47:16.350 --> 02:47:16.569]  God bless.
[02:47:18.170 --> 02:47:23.610]  God's hand was upon this that two weeks ago you said, you know, you go off your gut, which is all the data that focuses down into the gut.
[02:47:23.770 --> 02:47:24.649]  It's not really the gut.
[02:47:24.930 --> 02:47:25.809]  It's all that knowledge.
[02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:26.809]  You needed to be here today.
[02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:28.489]  This was God's hand on this.
[02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:30.750]  And thank you so much for the invite.
[02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.690]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:32.129 --> 02:47:32.430]  All right.
[02:47:33.350 --> 02:47:35.290]  There's an emergency court hearing going on right now.
[02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:36.069]  We'll be back.
[02:47:36.629 --> 02:47:37.750]  Stay with us for the next hour.
[02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:38.590]  Chase is coming in.
[02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:41.280]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[02:47:41.719 --> 02:47:47.600]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, yellowstonestore.com.
[02:47:47.879 --> 02:48:01.280]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:04.540]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[02:48:04.739 --> 02:48:08.479]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:22.110]  So, if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at AliceJonesStore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[02:48:22.350 --> 02:48:26.530]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[02:48:26.670 --> 02:48:29.770]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[02:48:30.010 --> 02:48:31.370]  Monthly member credits.

[02:48:38.530 --> 02:48:38.889]  That's right.
[02:48:39.129 --> 02:48:42.569]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.

[02:48:59.489 --> 02:49:02.770]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.

[02:49:20.090 --> 02:49:22.450]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.

[02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:26.610]  This is where it gets big, folks.

[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:44.680]  Free shipping.
[02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:47.860]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.260]  It just goes on from there.
[02:49:49.819 --> 02:49:56.379]  So, thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of thealexjonesstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[02:49:56.780 --> 02:49:58.700]  We're fighting the new world order.
[02:49:58.899 --> 02:50:00.579]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[02:50:00.739 --> 02:50:05.299]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[02:50:05.479 --> 02:50:06.739]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[02:50:07.479 --> 02:50:08.459]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:14.739]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:24.059]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[02:50:24.219 --> 02:50:31.319]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[02:50:31.459 --> 02:50:33.459]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[02:50:33.979 --> 02:50:36.420]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:37.639]  We've already...
[02:50:38.530 --> 02:50:39.610]  Just devastated them.
[02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:42.770]  I mean, the world government, the new world orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:44.350]  The whole world's turning against them.
[02:50:44.850 --> 02:50:48.629]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[02:50:49.069 --> 02:50:59.299]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.100]  So, again, I don't give up.
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:03.959]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:07.620]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[02:51:07.799 --> 02:51:10.059]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[02:51:10.180 --> 02:51:11.540]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[02:51:11.719 --> 02:51:20.260]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[02:51:20.459 --> 02:51:25.239]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[02:51:26.629 --> 02:51:28.629]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[02:51:30.010 --> 02:51:31.110]  I mean, it's just...
[02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:32.389]  This is a joke.
[02:51:32.829 --> 02:51:33.909]  This is ridiculous.
[02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:35.489]  We're changing the world.
[02:51:35.629 --> 02:51:38.489]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:43.569]  I want this to sink in on this Tuesday, September 22nd.
[02:51:45.209 --> 02:51:52.750]  And it's just a time to have our heads screwed on straight and to get on our knees to God because this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:55.549 --> 02:51:57.889]  We are not living in normal times.
[02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:09.290]  But I'll tell you this, we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought-provoking and dangerous time.
[02:52:09.430 --> 02:52:19.670]  There was a film made in the early 1990s that described exactly what's happening, but it condensed it down to something very simple.
[02:52:20.670 --> 02:52:22.489]  Something that happened very quickly.
[02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:26.969]  There's a real weapon.
[02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:29.430]  Takes it to time so you never know it hit you.
[02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:33.629]  That way you don't see it creeping up.
[02:52:36.409 --> 02:52:37.969]  Because we knew this was coming down.
[02:52:40.069 --> 02:52:41.250]  We knew what they were planning.
[02:52:45.350 --> 02:52:46.690]  And now we're sure of it.
[02:52:50.209 --> 02:52:53.670]  They are going to scuttle the whole country and bring it down.
[02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:58.950]  It's just that simple.
[02:53:01.069 --> 02:53:03.809]  Because where this AI is taking us is a nightmare situation.
[02:53:05.170 --> 02:53:10.069]  But they are going to try to execute their operation even though we're aware of it.
[02:53:10.469 --> 02:53:11.670]  They don't care.
[02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:15.489]  This is a doomsday scenario.
[02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:22.590]  By the way, you know what the Pentagon back in the 70s called this satellite grid hooked into the internet tracking everything you do?
[02:53:23.469 --> 02:53:25.149]  They called it Skynet.
[02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:31.590]  And we cannot sit here and let them do it.
[02:53:32.250 --> 02:53:40.350]  Because this country is two minutes from destruction, total annihilation, and war in the streets, and everything we've built flushed down the toilet.
[02:53:40.989 --> 02:53:43.670]  There is red fire in the sky.
[02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:51.610]  To try to exterminate humanity, the technology that they have deployed and developed to replace us.
[02:53:51.709 --> 02:53:55.370]  We're accepting Skynet and the AI system in.
[02:53:57.569 --> 02:53:59.489]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[02:54:00.610 --> 02:54:02.290]  Resistance is victory.
[02:54:02.909 --> 02:54:13.930]  That simple, initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is the most important decision you can make in the fight for freedom and human dignity.
[02:54:14.729 --> 02:54:16.530]  Do you understand that sorrow?
[02:54:16.989 --> 02:54:19.370]  You think you're gonna have this fight and have robots win it?
[02:54:19.610 --> 02:54:20.110]  No!
[02:54:21.399 --> 02:54:26.239]  I say to you, your technocracy is dead on arrival!
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:28.819]  We are in charge of the planet!
[02:54:39.899 --> 02:54:41.180]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:41.639 --> 02:54:43.260]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:55:18.709 --> 02:55:20.709]  We're good to go.
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:45.920]  I have but one heart to give to you Ladies and gentlemen, this is Chase Geyser, your host for the remaining 54 minutes of The Alex Jones Show before the great Owen Schroer takes over and hosts The War Room this afternoon.
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:49.840]  I am joined by the esteemed Candace Horback.
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:51.079]  It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:51.879]  Oh, same here.
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:52.659]  It's good to see you, Chase.
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:57.360]  I think the last time that we spoke in this context, I was actually on your podcast at chattingwithcandace.com.
[02:56:57.459 --> 02:56:58.239]  Excellent episode.
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:56:59.379]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:00.040]  You crushed it.
[02:57:00.159 --> 02:57:00.559]  Thank you.
[02:57:00.659 --> 02:57:01.260]  I appreciate that.
[02:57:01.399 --> 02:57:02.180]  No, it was a lot of fun.
[02:57:02.299 --> 02:57:02.899]  You got a great team.
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:06.299]  And you treat all of your guests like celebrities.
[02:57:06.479 --> 02:57:07.600]  So it's nice to get the celebrity treatment.
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:08.799]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:09.399]  Of course.
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:11.319]  So what's on your mind these days?
[02:57:11.399 --> 02:57:14.819]  Obviously, the last time you were here was for election night.
[02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:15.899]  That was a medley.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:16.979]  You left like halfway through.
[02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:17.899]  You totally gave up.
[02:57:18.049 --> 02:57:19.930]  I did not, it was almost 2 a.m.
[02:57:19.930 --> 02:57:22.170]  We're all working four more hours after she leaves.
[02:57:22.270 --> 02:57:23.290]  She's like, okay, I'm gonna go now.
[02:57:23.549 --> 02:57:28.309]  Oh my gosh, I thought I was gonna be here for an hour, and then I ended up being here for six, which was amazing.
[02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:32.250]  And I'm like, this is my Super Bowl, so check this off of my bucket list.
[02:57:32.430 --> 02:57:36.350]  And I don't know how you guys maintain that level of energy, but it was wildly impressive.
[02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:45.069]  I think I took three of these, and I normally have a cup of coffee, and then by the end of it, I was like, I just gotta go before I make a fool of myself from just utter exhaustion.
[02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:51.379]  And then also probably adrenal fatigue a little bit, too, because when Texas looked blue for a second, I thought both of us were going to have a coronary.
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:51.899]  Oh, yeah.
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:52.319]  Yeah.
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:56.100]  Well, I knew, I was confident that Trump was going to win.
[02:57:56.159 --> 02:57:57.600]  I didn't know it was going to be a landslide, though.
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:02.700]  See, if everything went honestly, I was like, absolutely, he's going to win.
[02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:08.399]  But there were some moments, especially where there was the lull in the counting, where I thought maybe some trickery was going to happen.
[02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:08.659]  Yeah.
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:09.559]  That was the case.
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:12.319]  Well, and there were weird ballots that came in at four in the morning, too, like in Detroit.
[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:12.620]  Right.
[02:58:12.659 --> 02:58:13.040]  For sure.
[02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:17.520]  And then once everything got settled and we had all the votes, and I don't know where it's at now.
[02:58:17.579 --> 02:58:22.379]  I think it's at 10 million voters that didn't vote this election.
[02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:24.280]  But at the height of it, it was in the 20s.
[02:58:24.459 --> 02:58:25.899]  How do you account for that?
[02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:29.340]  So we know that there was definitely something that happened last election.
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:30.420]  So that's where my nerves came.
[02:58:30.479 --> 02:58:34.219]  And it wasn't that he wasn't supposed to win or that the people didn't want him to win.
[02:58:34.319 --> 02:58:37.700]  It's like if this establishment was going to do something to keep him out of the office.
[02:58:37.850 --> 02:58:48.049]  I just thought it was so funny how the left for years was talking about how we have to protect democracy, threat to our democracy, democracy, democracy, which of course just means majority rule.
[02:58:48.489 --> 02:58:57.170]  And they didn't even win the popular vote because Republicans win the Electoral College regularly, but not so often recently, at least the popular vote.
[02:58:57.290 --> 02:59:03.829]  So the fact that most people disagree with the party that advocates for democracy so much was abundantly pleasing to me.
[02:59:04.059 --> 02:59:08.680]  Right, and now they're just saying that those people have low IQ or they're uninformed or they're misinformed.
[02:59:08.780 --> 02:59:10.799]  And that's the only reason that we saw this red wave, right?
[02:59:10.879 --> 02:59:15.559]  It wasn't that people were honestly sick of all of the nonsense that they've been perpetuating for the last four years.
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:17.819]  It was like, no, they just didn't know any better.
[02:59:17.979 --> 02:59:18.940]  So it's our job to now.
[02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:25.659]  I think it was, was it Kamala or Hillary that was saying we need to continue to censor all of these platforms so that we don't have these poor people.
[02:59:25.690 --> 02:59:26.750]  Both of them have said that.
[02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:27.329]  Falling for this.
[02:59:27.649 --> 02:59:29.590]  Hillary actually said we should be in camps.
[02:59:29.870 --> 02:59:30.889]  She said that seriously.
[02:59:30.930 --> 02:59:32.569]  She wasn't even making a crack or anything.
[02:59:32.709 --> 02:59:42.290]  But I saw a clip the other day of Bill Clinton saying that the reason people don't trust the media is because Donald Trump has attacked the media so much.
[02:59:42.629 --> 02:59:44.829]  It's just cognitive dissonance at this point.
[02:59:44.989 --> 02:59:45.549]  I don't understand.
[02:59:45.770 --> 02:59:49.690]  And how does he still have any platforms that are welcoming him on?
[02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:58.790]  We know that he has done, or not has done, but is at least very closely linked to some troubling illegal acts, right?
[02:59:59.250 --> 03:00:00.649]  He's certainly a rapist.
[03:00:01.010 --> 03:00:02.870]  Yeah, and how many women have to come forward?
[03:00:02.969 --> 03:00:06.049]  Although you have Hillary Clinton saying, we need to destroy these women.
[03:00:06.270 --> 03:00:08.170]  Well, that's not very feminist of you.
[03:00:08.690 --> 03:00:09.829]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:11.690 --> 03:00:14.569]  I'm actually kind of more nervous now than ever.
[03:00:15.049 --> 03:00:23.010]  The last four years, there's something comforting about being at rock bottom because it doesn't get worse, right?
[03:00:23.090 --> 03:00:26.450]  I mean, it's the famous line from Cool Hand Luke where he says, sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
[03:00:26.549 --> 03:00:27.649]  So you can risk everything.
[03:00:27.809 --> 03:00:30.590]  You can bet hard because you don't have anything to lose, so you just go hard.
[03:00:30.969 --> 03:00:32.329]  And we hit this rock bottom.
[03:00:32.450 --> 03:00:33.049]  Then we won.
[03:00:33.149 --> 03:00:37.690]  Of course, that was exhilarating, but I feel like things are going to get really hard.
[03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:40.170]  Until January or after January?
[03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.649]  Both.
[03:00:41.290 --> 03:00:57.690]  I just think, if you look at what happened in 2016, all hell broke loose after he won that time with the impeachments and the Russian collusion hoax, and they're bringing in Mark Zuckerberg to congressional hearings to talk about Cambridge Analytica and whether or not they were giving data to the Russians that helped them manipulate voters.
[03:00:58.149 --> 03:01:05.860]  I just wonder what they're gonna pull, and I've been a little creeped out at How well they've taken it.
[03:01:06.079 --> 03:01:13.200]  Pundits aside and leftists on TikTok aside, the establishment left is acting very suspicious to me.
[03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:20.219]  Well, do you think that having the majority, so having the House, the Senate, and then Trump, do you think that that protects in any way?
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:20.479]  Sure.
[03:01:20.479 --> 03:01:26.540]  Or Tulsi actually gets appointed too, but that's gonna help protect against a lot of these bogus charges that happened last time.
[03:01:26.579 --> 03:01:31.120]  Yeah, I think he's gonna be okay in terms of his literal litigation.
[03:01:31.399 --> 03:01:31.620]  Mm-hm.
[03:01:32.780 --> 03:01:35.280]  I only really like maybe a third of the Republican Party.
[03:01:36.239 --> 03:01:39.540]  There's the neocons and then there's the MAGA Republicans.
[03:01:39.540 --> 03:01:41.520]  It's like populism versus war.
[03:01:41.879 --> 03:01:42.020]  Yeah.
[03:01:42.180 --> 03:01:47.520]  And they're infighting too quietly, mostly in DMs like the Sebastian Gorkas and people like that from behind the scenes.
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:59.299]  So I think what we're witnessing and what we're gonna see over the course of the next four years is not just a divide between right and left, but I think we're gonna see The Republican Party change form into a populist party.
[03:01:59.399 --> 03:02:06.700]  And I think those neocons are gonna be weeded out, but they're so entrenched in the establishment that it's gonna be a very painful tumor to remove.
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:08.440]  I think it's a beautiful thing, though.
[03:02:08.579 --> 03:02:14.959]  And then Trump was the first person to actually speak at the Libertarian conference in a meaningful way, and he made some promises there.
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:18.959]  And I think he's supposed to be keeping a cabinet seat open for one of their party members.
[03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:22.280]  And honestly- Tell me you've got Bitcoin without telling me you've got Bitcoin.
[03:02:22.799 --> 03:02:28.139]  I've got a lot of Bitcoin, I've got a lot of Doge, and Mama's gonna retire very soon, so keep pumping.
[03:02:28.139 --> 03:02:28.620]  That's awesome.
[03:02:28.719 --> 03:02:30.559]  I know, I'm crushing it, so it's really good.
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:31.280]  At what point are you gonna sell?
[03:02:31.559 --> 03:02:32.159]  What are you waiting for?
[03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:32.360]  Never.
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:32.620]  Never?
[03:02:32.899 --> 03:02:34.120]  No, you're an ape, right?
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:35.059]  You have to be an ape.
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:35.760]  Wow.
[03:02:36.059 --> 03:02:36.180]  Yes.
[03:02:36.379 --> 03:02:38.260]  So how did you first learn about Bitcoin?
[03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:39.479]  My gosh.
[03:02:41.399 --> 03:02:48.159]  Honestly, I think there's a weird crossover for people that exist on the fringes of society, right?
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:50.260]  Or don't like being told what to do.
[03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:50.680]  Yeah.
[03:02:50.799 --> 03:02:53.020]  And then you see the debasement of the dollar happening.
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:54.620]  I don't know.
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:57.479]  I saw the trend happening with central bank digital currency.
[03:02:58.030 --> 03:02:59.149]  And it's a matter of time.
[03:02:59.290 --> 03:03:06.930]  So I think it's one of those things that if you talk about freedom and the importance of sovereignty, you have to try to apply that to all aspects of your life, including financial.
[03:03:07.270 --> 03:03:11.969]  So I think that's what Bitcoin is a great opportunity for, a vehicle for, and then Doge as well.
[03:03:12.069 --> 03:03:28.129]  And you can't have someone like Elon who's dropping not even subtle hints about the importance of it, and it's gonna be integrated into X. It's a matter of time until that's the main currency that's getting paid out and also accepted within the platform, especially if he starts paying We're creators similar to a YouTube situation,
[03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:29.590]  so that's only gonna go up as well.
[03:03:30.409 --> 03:03:32.549]  Do you think that Elon Musk is Satoshi Nakamoto?
[03:03:33.309 --> 03:03:35.370]  That would be a plot twist, but no.
[03:03:35.629 --> 03:03:37.829]  And then you're the one that told me about the whole CIA thing.
[03:03:37.909 --> 03:03:39.329]  Yeah, it means central intelligence in Japanese.
[03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:41.590]  But I don't think that that necessarily means it's bad, right?
[03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:43.030]  I don't know.
[03:03:43.430 --> 03:03:44.670]  Nobody knows for sure.
[03:03:44.829 --> 03:03:45.930]  I don't like the CIA, though.
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:49.079]  No, there's probably some good actors though, right?
[03:03:49.219 --> 03:03:52.139]  It's the thing- I often wonder, it's white hats versus black hats for sure.
[03:03:52.159 --> 03:03:53.379]  It got too inflamed, right?
[03:03:53.540 --> 03:03:54.520]  And nobody talks about that.
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:04:01.579]  There's actually, I think, a civil war happening right now within our own institutions, and nobody talks about it because it's totally covert.
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:13.629]  I totally believe that there are populist, nationalist, America first people within the FBI and the CIA and these institutions that are quietly At war with their colleagues.
[03:04:13.809 --> 03:04:21.969]  And I think one of the biggest pieces of evidence for that is the fact that they prosecuted Epstein to hell, but then they didn't release the list.
[03:04:22.270 --> 03:04:25.590]  So why would you ever prosecute him to begin with if you didn't want anyone to know about it?
[03:04:25.649 --> 03:04:27.069]  It's the White Hats versus the Black Hats.
[03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:28.969]  There were the good guys that were like, we're gonna get them.
[03:04:29.049 --> 03:04:30.569]  And there were the bad guys like, we don't have the list.
[03:04:30.690 --> 03:04:31.430]  You nailed it.
[03:04:31.989 --> 03:04:34.809]  I totally think there's a civil war happening in our intelligence community.
[03:04:34.889 --> 03:04:36.409]  Right, cuz that didn't make any sense either.
[03:04:36.530 --> 03:04:38.829]  I'm like, well, why are you gonna do that if you're not gonna disclose the names?
[03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.170]  Right.
[03:04:39.409 --> 03:04:39.729]  Absolutely.
[03:04:40.879 --> 03:04:44.180]  So maybe we'll see movies about it in 50 years and it'll just be crazy what happened.
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.260]  And you'll be like, I told you so.
[03:04:46.659 --> 03:04:50.559]  It's like a mini covert operation here at Infowars behind the scenes.
[03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:57.479]  I mean, it was so crazy when we got shut down last Thursday because there was a camera crew here working on a project for Alex.
[03:05:00.219 --> 03:05:03.959]  This place was like everybody was running around, scrambling, trying to get to the other studio.
[03:05:04.319 --> 03:05:06.420]  And we didn't know until Alex.
[03:05:06.559 --> 03:05:08.139]  Alex called me at 7.36 a.m.
[03:05:08.180 --> 03:05:10.899]  and I was sleeping in my office on the recliner in there.
[03:05:11.479 --> 03:05:19.860]  And I slept here because I thought it was very bizarre that they emailed us the night before after the auction was over.
[03:05:19.940 --> 03:05:20.780]  It had been over for hours.
[03:05:20.899 --> 03:05:23.799]  And they told us they were going to tell us the results the next morning.
[03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:26.610]  So I was like, that's weird.
[03:05:26.909 --> 03:05:28.610]  Because why wouldn't you tell us now if you know?
[03:05:28.770 --> 03:05:33.270]  Right, because you would assume that everyone that was participating in the auction was already accredited and vetted.
[03:05:33.489 --> 03:05:37.090]  So there shouldn't be any kind of gap between when the, right?
[03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.350]  Exactly.
[03:05:37.350 --> 03:05:38.850]  If you went to any auction, it's immediate.
[03:05:39.209 --> 03:05:41.889]  Well, and the reason is that they just didn't want us to talk about it on air.
[03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:45.569]  So they wanted to shut down the building before anybody got here.
[03:05:45.709 --> 03:05:47.069]  So a few of us slept here.
[03:05:47.250 --> 03:05:47.569]  Nice.
[03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:49.510]  And Jones called me at 736 in the morning.
[03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:51.069]  They're coming right now to shut down.
[03:05:51.569 --> 03:05:54.829]  The studio, I'm going to be there in 15 minutes going live.
[03:05:55.770 --> 03:06:00.569]  They pulled the plug when Harrison Smith, our morning host, was in mid-sentence.
[03:06:00.930 --> 03:06:04.770]  And we were on air, on time from the backup studio at 11 a.m.
[03:06:04.850 --> 03:06:06.290]  for the Alex Jones Show, and it was glorious.
[03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:07.270]  It was seamless.
[03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:08.510]  It was honestly seamless.
[03:06:08.709 --> 03:06:13.010]  And not to gas you up or anything, but I think everyone needs a friend like you.
[03:06:13.170 --> 03:06:14.149]  Thanks, I appreciate that.
[03:06:14.170 --> 03:06:16.409]  You're so loyal and you work so freaking hard.
[03:06:16.690 --> 03:06:19.649]  So yeah, I appreciate what you do here, and I'm sure everyone else does as well.
[03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:20.260]  Well, thank you.
[03:06:20.299 --> 03:06:21.079]  I appreciate that.
[03:06:22.520 --> 03:06:31.020]  When you do something that you love and when you only associate with people that you admire or respect, it's very easy to be loyal and it's very easy to work hard.
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:35.000]  You say that, but I don't think it's easy or common.
[03:06:35.559 --> 03:06:37.760]  It is easy if you're a good person, right?
[03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:39.100]  But it's not very common.
[03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:40.680]  Yeah, well, thank you.
[03:06:40.739 --> 03:06:41.360]  I appreciate that.
[03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:42.120]  I'm just excited.
[03:06:42.219 --> 03:06:54.399]  I couldn't believe that this We're good to go.
[03:07:15.869 --> 03:07:31.290]  I just think it's so badass that the richest and smartest man in the world who single-handedly saved freedom of speech on the internet Is now involved in this operation and I still come into work here and I can't believe that.
[03:07:31.489 --> 03:07:32.569]  I feel like I'm still dreaming.
[03:07:32.709 --> 03:07:36.610]  I feel like I'm about to wake up and just be normal and have a normal job.
[03:07:36.909 --> 03:07:38.229]  It's an incredible feeling.
[03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:43.639]  So do you think that this kind of merge of MSNBC and InfoWars is going to happen?
[03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:47.100]  I don't know, but you can get the shirt at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:49.600]  I'm going to get and need one of those immediately.
[03:07:50.379 --> 03:07:53.959]  But the whole Elon acquiring X started as a joke as well.
[03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:56.620]  So he's- But did it?
[03:07:57.219 --> 03:07:57.879]  Right, did it.
[03:07:57.920 --> 03:08:00.760]  I think he teases it like it's a joke so he can walk it back if he wants.
[03:08:00.979 --> 03:08:01.420]  He's like A-B testing.
[03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:04.340]  Yeah, and then he sees the feedback and he's like, all right, this will work.
[03:08:05.530 --> 03:08:06.389]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:08:06.549 --> 03:08:08.469]  But every time he teases something, he ends up doing it.
[03:08:08.549 --> 03:08:09.469]  And he's been teasing this thing.
[03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:15.709]  He just really ambiguously, a few months ago, replied to some random ex post.
[03:08:15.790 --> 03:08:16.750]  I can't remember what it was.
[03:08:16.930 --> 03:08:18.030]  And he just said...
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:20.280]  It's an info war.
[03:08:20.780 --> 03:08:24.540]  And I was like, nobody just says that colloquially.
[03:08:24.639 --> 03:08:27.579]  I mean, because it's a household name now is this company.
[03:08:27.799 --> 03:08:28.000]  Yeah.
[03:08:28.340 --> 03:08:30.459]  And I just knew.
[03:08:30.620 --> 03:08:32.159]  And Alex is very discreet.
[03:08:32.319 --> 03:08:35.299]  I don't even know what their communication is like at all.
[03:08:36.299 --> 03:08:43.139]  So, we here at InfoWars get news about what's happening to InfoWars the same time the audience does.
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:47.020]  Like, what's Alex gonna say about our jobs at 11?
[03:08:47.780 --> 03:08:50.399]  It's just that type of operation, so it's been a wild ride.
[03:08:50.479 --> 03:08:56.360]  Well, if it happens and you do a segment that's similar to The View, I've got an excellent suggestion for ladies for the panel.
[03:08:56.620 --> 03:08:57.920]  Yeah, are you trying to get a job?
[03:08:58.059 --> 03:08:58.899]  For sure, yeah.
[03:08:58.959 --> 03:09:00.120]  I told you, I'm trying to get to Texas.
[03:09:01.539 --> 03:09:02.899]  Yeah, we should do it.
[03:09:02.959 --> 03:09:03.879]  You should be the host.
[03:09:04.059 --> 03:09:04.260]  Yeah.
[03:09:04.620 --> 03:09:07.620]  I have a couple other amazing ladies that would do a very good job.
[03:09:07.739 --> 03:09:10.680]  We'll make you read all those legal notices that they had to read this week.
[03:09:10.739 --> 03:09:14.680]  And I'll just do it like someone's torturing my puppy in the background and I have to do it.
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:15.760]  Otherwise, they're going to kill it.
[03:09:15.940 --> 03:09:17.139]  Her face, right?
[03:09:17.299 --> 03:09:18.200]  It was just...
[03:09:18.200 --> 03:09:18.600]  Yeah.
[03:09:18.899 --> 03:09:20.319]  She did not want to be there.
[03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:21.299]  I know.
[03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:27.639]  And that's what's so bizarre to me about it is the cognitive dissonance, like you mentioned, Candace.
[03:09:28.430 --> 03:09:39.309]  And just incessant lies and subjective interpretation disguised as journalism over the years.
[03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:43.709]  And then to see that they're surprised that they have to read a legal notice.
[03:09:43.729 --> 03:09:57.229]  And they feel like it's not just that they should legally have to say that there were no charges ever brought against Matt Gaetz after they incessantly accused him of sexual assault or trafficking or whatever those trumped up charges were.
[03:09:58.579 --> 03:10:08.719]  It's really sad to see people not only make the decision to be evil, but then be disappointed that They didn't win.
[03:10:09.180 --> 03:10:09.840]  I don't know.
[03:10:09.979 --> 03:10:12.399]  It's so foreign to me.
[03:10:12.500 --> 03:10:13.379]  It's so counterintuitive to me.
[03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:13.739]  What do you think?
[03:10:13.940 --> 03:10:15.020]  No, I totally agree.
[03:10:15.139 --> 03:10:22.420]  And I think some people that will criticize that thought or that statement, they won't equate lying to being evil.
[03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:23.239]  And it absolutely is.
[03:10:23.319 --> 03:10:27.180]  There's this great book called People of the Lie by Scott Fitzgerald, I believe.
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:29.280]  And it's the same thing, right?
[03:10:29.399 --> 03:10:33.700]  Because evil is downstream of all of these small decisions that you make when it comes to lies.
[03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:36.760]  So one thing leads to another, leads to another, and this thing becomes overwhelming.
[03:10:37.209 --> 03:10:40.329]  And they're inextricably linked.
[03:10:40.590 --> 03:10:44.309]  So yeah, a lie is absolutely the same thing as an evil act, I think.
[03:10:44.729 --> 03:10:48.350]  And then that ties into one of the things that I was bringing for the notes.
[03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:57.969]  It was, maybe it's not on here, but it's the idea of You have an accusation that can be a decade or two decades old.
[03:10:58.149 --> 03:11:00.030]  The person is not found guilty.
[03:11:00.250 --> 03:11:00.870]  It gets dismissed.
[03:11:01.149 --> 03:11:05.629]  There might be a settlement, but a settlement does not mean that you're guilty.
[03:11:05.629 --> 03:11:07.790]  It just means shut up and go away, right?
[03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:11.729]  It's just I'm paying for you to stop antagonizing me potentially.
[03:11:12.049 --> 03:11:16.350]  And then we'll drudge these up and say, well, see, someone made an accusation.
[03:11:16.409 --> 03:11:17.989]  Why would an innocent person ever settle, right?
[03:11:18.049 --> 03:11:22.510]  Right, and now they are disqualified from having any position with an office.
[03:11:22.690 --> 03:11:23.489]  That makes no sense.
[03:11:23.649 --> 03:11:29.010]  So we either have innocent until proven guilty or we don't, right?
[03:11:29.129 --> 03:11:31.329]  And you don't get to pick and choose when that applies.
[03:11:31.989 --> 03:11:32.350]  Absolutely.
[03:11:32.610 --> 03:11:45.450]  Well, and I think it's interesting, too, because you mentioned earlier on this show today how if you have a principle that applies to one thing, then you should be able to extrapolate and apply it in different fabrics of your life when you're talking about Bitcoin.
[03:11:47.280 --> 03:12:00.760]  When I think about lying and how unhealthy it is, it's not just something that's unhealthy on an individual one-on-one basis in your personal life, but it's so unhealthy and proportionally so, if not worse, on a national level.
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:05.100]  I'm not talking about the news or the CIA, but even our money itself.
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:06.879]  Is actually a lie.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:08.180]  There is no real value.
[03:12:08.379 --> 03:12:09.100]  It's all pretend.
[03:12:09.260 --> 03:12:09.860]  It's all made up.
[03:12:10.020 --> 03:12:13.420]  There's no need for them to collect any income tax because they just print the money anyway.
[03:12:13.559 --> 03:12:21.840]  So they're already taxing you with inflation, and then they're charging you so you feel like you're paying taxes, but they don't need your tax money at all because they could just print it.
[03:12:22.159 --> 03:12:45.450]  It's so bizarre, and I'm very, very concerned that the left and the establishment is going to allow for the inevitable collapse of Of the dollar to happen under Trump's presidency in order to blame patriotism or blame populism and capitalistic kind of free enterprise values for an economic crisis and then just use that to try to manipulate the masses and never supporting populism again.
[03:12:45.479 --> 03:12:50.760]  Well, he's been super open and loud about being a proponent of Bitcoin specifically.
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:53.620]  So that community 100% voted for him.
[03:12:53.719 --> 03:12:54.879]  I don't think- It's gotta be Barron.
[03:12:55.239 --> 03:12:56.639]  Barron's like, dad, I have so much Bitcoin.
[03:12:56.799 --> 03:13:01.659]  I don't think anyone that owns any Satoshis or Bitcoin voted for anyone other than him, right?
[03:13:01.819 --> 03:13:04.680]  So I think, yeah, go ahead, screw the dollar over.
[03:13:04.799 --> 03:13:07.260]  But I think that's why you have to have alternatives.
[03:13:08.059 --> 03:13:09.680]  What do you think about all these World War III developments?
[03:13:09.879 --> 03:13:11.780]  Do you think that we're on the verge of nuclear holocaust?
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:13.739]  It scares me, it definitely does.
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:16.940]  And I remember it was the day after the election and Alex was talking about it.
[03:13:17.059 --> 03:13:20.540]  And it was something like breaking news, World War III development.
[03:13:20.899 --> 03:13:24.819]  And it was the thing that was kind of running the majority of that day.
[03:13:24.979 --> 03:13:28.620]  And I had people that were sending it to me and were criticizing him.
[03:13:28.719 --> 03:13:32.840]  And they were saying, see, he's an alarmist, all he does is Armageddon.
[03:13:33.829 --> 03:13:35.010]  Propaganda, blah, blah, blah.
[03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:36.770]  And I was like, well, did you actually look into it?
[03:13:36.850 --> 03:13:40.209]  Because it's not being exaggerated.
[03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:44.989]  So us allowing those long-range missiles to be- We have the documents, folks.
[03:13:45.290 --> 03:13:48.090]  He's not saying anything that you can't look up and verify.
[03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:52.629]  So it's this weird thing where I think people are maybe so terrified of that actually being an option.
[03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:58.229]  The best solution is just to deny it, to deny the possibility of that threat existing.
[03:13:58.450 --> 03:14:01.690]  So to do that, you have to have one villain and they choose Alex.
[03:14:02.299 --> 03:14:11.059]  How do you get people on a mass scale to shift away from living in denial?
[03:14:11.379 --> 03:14:20.719]  Because it is so comforting to just pretend that the world is, the universe is as you hope it is, and then just ignore anything that proves otherwise.
[03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:23.180]  But inevitably, that's gonna bust.
[03:14:24.049 --> 03:14:27.610]  How do we shift it so people actually have the courage to embrace the truth when it's uncomfortable?
[03:14:27.829 --> 03:14:31.889]  So this is, I'm very rarely a nihilist or I'm not.
[03:14:32.110 --> 03:14:34.510]  I feel like I lean towards optimism.
[03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:41.709]  The way that I have heard it presented and kind of agree with is that you've got your wolves, you've got your sheepdogs, and you have your sheep.
[03:14:41.930 --> 03:14:49.229]  So it's not to be concentrating on the sheep because they're going to follow whatever is kind of antagonizing, nipping on their heels or leading them.
[03:14:49.600 --> 03:14:55.579]  So you can sit there and try to get the sheep to be a sheepdog or to discover that they're a wolf.
[03:14:55.700 --> 03:14:57.260]  It's probably not going to happen, a sheep is a sheep.
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:15:01.819]  So instead of that being your focal point, go after the wolves, be a sheepdog.
[03:15:02.079 --> 03:15:03.500]  And then that's how you make the change.
[03:15:03.879 --> 03:15:06.459]  Guys, you got to find that clip of Christopher Walken.
[03:15:06.459 --> 03:15:07.540]  I can't remember the name of the movie.
[03:15:07.959 --> 03:15:11.840]  What's the scene where he talks about the lion realizing he's a lion?
[03:15:12.180 --> 03:15:16.459]  Look that up because I want to run that at the beginning of the next segment after we go to break.
[03:15:16.579 --> 03:15:19.159]  But before we go to break, I want to talk a little bit about your podcast.
[03:15:20.029 --> 03:15:20.750]  ChattingwithCandice.com.
[03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:26.889]  Obviously, I am by far the best guest that you've ever had, but other than me, who are some of your favorite guests that you've had?
[03:15:26.989 --> 03:15:30.469]  It's impossible to pick one, but who comes to mind?
[03:15:30.629 --> 03:15:33.989]  What was one you walked away from, though, and you're like, wow, that was awesome.
[03:15:33.989 --> 03:15:34.950]  There's not even a close second.
[03:15:35.049 --> 03:15:35.170]  Okay.
[03:15:35.209 --> 03:15:41.530]  But if I had to choose, I would say off the top of my head, my episode with Bridget Phetasy is really amazing.
[03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:42.729]  I don't know if you're familiar with her.
[03:15:42.909 --> 03:15:47.510]  She's here in Austin as well, amazing comic, has an excellent podcast as well.
[03:15:48.049 --> 03:15:59.159]  And then my other episode with Kelsey Sheeran, and her main project right now is talking about MAID and trying to get it shut down because it's just expanding everywhere, so medical assistance in dying, Right.
[03:15:59.420 --> 03:16:01.659]  But when the government pays for healthcare, they love killing you.
[03:16:01.799 --> 03:16:02.000]  Exactly.
[03:16:02.159 --> 03:16:05.379]  Because I think, what is it, like 60% of all healthcare costs are in the last 90 days of life?
[03:16:05.879 --> 03:16:07.219]  So that's why they want to kill you.
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:15.870]  Yeah, I mean, so you'll have someone, a veteran that goes there for complex PTSD. They'll go to seek treatment, psychedelic therapies, because that is legal up in Sure.
[03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:29.110]  And they're like, actually, instead of giving you this mushroom that is pretty much undoubtedly proven to at least help get you to the next place or help decrease your depression or anxiety or whatever that might be, we're just gonna put you in a death pod.
[03:16:29.270 --> 03:16:32.409]  So she's doing really incredible work, so those are probably my top three episodes.
[03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:41.969]  What's something that you've learned since hosting a podcast, and how have you changed as a host or a spokesperson over the course of the episodes that you've done?
[03:16:42.489 --> 03:16:49.690]  I've learned to listen more than talk, and then not to over-identify with anything that I've held as a long belief, right?
[03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:54.750]  So always be open to being wrong and learning a different perspective.
[03:16:54.989 --> 03:17:00.829]  And then it's like, I think for a long time, I thought certain things were just obvious, and I was a little bit cemented in some things.
[03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:09.950]  And then just having conversations with so many different kinds of people, you can say, well, their disagreement with me is not a direct attack on me as an individual.
[03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:12.270]  It's just an opportunity for me to sharpen my opinion.
[03:17:12.579 --> 03:17:16.559]  Right, so has anybody successfully changed your mind on any issue?
[03:17:16.739 --> 03:17:17.579]  That's a good question.
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:23.979]  Not that I can think of off the top of my head.
[03:17:26.620 --> 03:17:34.840]  So one of the things I think Buck Angel does a really good job at, especially with everything that's so clickbaity right now when it comes to trans issues.
[03:17:35.399 --> 03:17:37.299]  Hey guys, smash that like button.
[03:17:38.400 --> 03:17:41.899]  Is we want to have just a binary.
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:47.079]  So it's just if you are a biological man, this is the answer for the bathrooms, right?
[03:17:47.159 --> 03:17:51.120]  And that's one of the things with the Nancy Mays rants that she's going on to.
[03:17:51.319 --> 03:17:52.299]  Like, I don't know.
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:53.920]  I think Buck should use the men's room.
[03:17:54.020 --> 03:17:58.079]  And he even says, you know, I'll use the unisex if that's an option.
[03:17:58.200 --> 03:17:59.100]  Or Blair White, for example.
[03:17:59.120 --> 03:17:59.819]  Or just hold it.
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:01.040]  Or just hold it.
[03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:02.200]  I don't know.
[03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:05.399]  I would say he's one of those people that doesn't exist in a bucket.
[03:18:05.559 --> 03:18:06.879]  He's more nuanced.
[03:18:06.979 --> 03:18:10.319]  I think the thing is, everybody sees what they're doing to children in the schools.
[03:18:10.319 --> 03:18:11.280]  And he disagrees with all that.
[03:18:11.280 --> 03:18:17.180]  And people are like, look, if people don't want to concede any ground because they just know it's going to end up in an elementary school.
[03:18:17.530 --> 03:18:23.670]  Well, that's the thing too, that's where I don't have- Guys, I thought we solved all these problems when we legalized gay marriage.
[03:18:23.809 --> 03:18:25.069]  I was like, finally, that's behind us.
[03:18:25.149 --> 03:18:26.370]  And then it got weirder.
[03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:28.190]  It's like, how about this kind of sex?
[03:18:28.530 --> 03:18:29.090]  I was like, what?
[03:18:29.729 --> 03:18:33.510]  Have you seen those viral videos of the gay dudes?
[03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:39.370]  And they're like, everyone said that gay marriage was a slippery slope, and we just wanted to be left alone.
[03:18:39.549 --> 03:18:42.209]  But looking around, did you ever think maybe they were right?
[03:18:42.690 --> 03:18:44.590]  Maybe they were right this whole time.
[03:18:45.170 --> 03:18:45.969]  I have seen that.
[03:18:46.049 --> 03:18:46.590]  I have seen that.
[03:18:46.729 --> 03:18:47.790]  There's some truth to it.
[03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:48.469]  I know.
[03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:50.329]  So I agree with conceding, right?
[03:18:50.450 --> 03:18:51.549]  Because it does happen.
[03:18:51.870 --> 03:18:53.770]  That whole slippery slope is true.
[03:18:54.049 --> 03:18:55.170]  So I don't know what the solution is.
[03:18:55.209 --> 03:18:56.729]  I guess it's not to concede at all, right?
[03:18:57.629 --> 03:18:58.909]  All right, folks, we're coming up on a break.
[03:18:58.989 --> 03:19:05.729]  Make sure you go to thealexjonesstore.com to be the reason that Alex Jones will always be on the air and stay with us for more from Candace Horbach on the other side.

[03:21:03.989 --> 03:21:04.690]  We salute you.
[03:21:14.629 --> 03:21:17.430]  You watch those nature documentaries on the cable?
[03:21:19.190 --> 03:21:19.510]  Yeah.
[03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:21.409]  You see the one about lions?
[03:21:23.010 --> 03:21:23.670]  Yeah.
[03:21:24.629 --> 03:21:25.729]  Look at this lion.
[03:21:27.049 --> 03:21:28.729]  He's the king of the jungle.
[03:21:29.190 --> 03:21:31.030]  Huge mane out there.
[03:21:31.690 --> 03:21:35.590]  He's laying down under a tree in the middle of Africa.
[03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:37.170]  He's so big.
[03:21:37.829 --> 03:21:39.090]  He's so hot.
[03:21:40.590 --> 03:21:42.229]  He doesn't want to move.
[03:21:43.350 --> 03:21:45.270]  Now, the little lion comes.
[03:21:45.450 --> 03:21:46.670]  They start messing with him.
[03:21:50.489 --> 03:21:51.530]  He doesn't do anything.
[03:21:52.329 --> 03:21:58.290]  The lioness, she starts messing with him, coming over, making trouble.
[03:21:58.649 --> 03:22:00.229]  Still, nothing.
[03:22:00.850 --> 03:22:06.030]  Now, the other animals, they notice this, and they start to move in.
[03:22:06.450 --> 03:22:13.329]  The jackals, hyenas, they're barking at him, laughing at him.
[03:22:14.959 --> 03:22:19.200]  They nip his toes and eat the food that's in his domain.
[03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:34.360]  They do this, and they get closer and closer and bolder and bolder, until one day that lion gets up and tears the shit out of everybody, runs like the wind, eats everything in his path.
[03:22:34.680 --> 03:22:39.100]  Because every once in a while the lion has to show the jackals.
[03:22:48.159 --> 03:22:49.479]  It's too late to be scared.
[03:22:50.520 --> 03:22:51.659]  It's time to kill.
[03:22:52.959 --> 03:22:54.280]  I'm going to the other room.
[03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:56.520]  You come out when you're ready.
[03:22:56.700 --> 03:23:00.559]  So it just reminded me of that scene when you were talking about the sheep are going to be sheep.
[03:23:01.319 --> 03:23:05.299]  And I actually want to transition a little bit for lack of a better term.
[03:23:08.559 --> 03:23:10.680]  What do you think is the state of men today?
[03:23:11.500 --> 03:23:11.860]  Boy.
[03:23:13.059 --> 03:23:16.100]  Because it's like the lion who doesn't know he's a lion, right?
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:17.399]  What's going on?
[03:23:18.209 --> 03:23:25.170]  Well, I think part of it is the decline in testosterone from a lot of reasons, probably intentionally, so poisoning the food, poisoning the water.
[03:23:25.709 --> 03:23:32.450]  I think feminism had a big role in that, and that's gonna sound a little bit crazy, but they've done studies and you can look at grip strength.
[03:23:33.329 --> 03:23:40.799]  Grip strength within men has been on a steady decrease for- Probably almost two decades now where women's is actually going up.
[03:23:41.079 --> 03:23:46.840]  So you actually have this masculinization of women and this masculinization or feminization of men that's happening.
[03:23:47.020 --> 03:23:48.420]  And I think a lot of it's probably chemical.
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:54.079]  And then on top of that, we all know mindset is wildly important and that affects your body chemistry as well.
[03:23:54.219 --> 03:24:02.920]  So then men are just constantly inundated with all this information that you're not good enough or simply by being born a man that somehow you are a danger or you're wrong.
[03:24:03.319 --> 03:24:18.600]  So if you have that and then you couple that with being raised by a feminist mother, right, who is raising you to be a good little girl instead of helping you develop into a young, strong man that is capable of violence but learns to control it,
[03:24:18.680 --> 03:24:18.719]  right?
[03:24:18.780 --> 03:24:22.739]  Like the Iron John, the key to the masculinity lies under the mother's pillow.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:31.870]  So it's the idea that the mom is actually almost more responsible for the development of We have a man than the father even because she has to sever that cord intentionally.
[03:24:32.190 --> 03:24:38.450]  So I think that men are being attacked for their just simply existing and their masculinity and they have been for a very long time.
[03:24:38.629 --> 03:24:40.709]  So they need good examples.
[03:24:40.909 --> 03:24:41.969]  They need leadership, right?
[03:24:42.049 --> 03:24:44.229]  Because you can't be what you haven't really seen before.
[03:24:44.610 --> 03:24:48.370]  So if you don't have good role models being presented, you're like, I don't know what I'm supposed to be.
[03:24:48.549 --> 03:24:55.850]  It's almost like- And all of our heroes in American culture are constantly berated, whether they're old cinema heroes or whether they're founding fathers.
[03:24:56.090 --> 03:24:57.110]  I mean, these people are badasses.
[03:24:57.379 --> 03:24:59.200]  For sure, and they were super young, too.
[03:24:59.819 --> 03:25:08.180]  It's gonna sound maybe silly to some people, but if you look at a lot of the Disney movies, for example, the man is always incompetent, and it's always a female that saves him.
[03:25:08.260 --> 03:25:09.979]  And it's been like that for a very long time.
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:12.139]  So all of these movies- I mean, Mulan, literally.
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:14.479]  I'm gonna pretend to be a man so I can do it better.
[03:25:14.579 --> 03:25:17.760]  And she's stronger than the general and the prince and all of that.
[03:25:17.940 --> 03:25:21.540]  Even Ariel, the little mermaid, is saving him from a shipwreck.
[03:25:21.719 --> 03:25:24.040]  So one of my girlfriends- But at least she lost her voice.
[03:25:24.420 --> 03:25:24.780]  Yeah.
[03:25:24.819 --> 03:25:26.540]  I mean, she did not nag once.
[03:25:26.639 --> 03:25:28.540]  When I shouldn't be talking and then my mic gets cut.
[03:25:30.119 --> 03:25:34.280]  Have you ever seen that meme of why the Lord of the Rings is the best trilogy of all time?
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:34.579]  No.
[03:25:34.799 --> 03:25:38.639]  And it goes, because this is the only time in the whole trilogy that two women talk to each other.
[03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:41.399]  And it's some little girl like, Mommy, are we going to be okay?
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:42.379]  And the mom's just like, shh.
[03:25:42.479 --> 03:25:45.379]  And that was literally the only time in the whole series the two women spoke to each other.
[03:25:45.500 --> 03:25:47.219]  It's like a super viral meme.
[03:25:47.940 --> 03:25:49.340]  Yeah, I'm with you on all that.
[03:25:49.379 --> 03:25:49.840]  I agree with you.
[03:25:49.899 --> 03:25:52.399]  I think the chemicals have a lot to do with it.
[03:25:52.959 --> 03:25:54.899]  And the feminist movement has a lot to do with it.
[03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:58.020]  But I think it's ultimately very deeply rooted in inflation.
[03:25:59.629 --> 03:26:07.889]  Because when we went off of the gold standard, and inflation was a problem before that, all of a sudden, the value of money started to decline.
[03:26:07.969 --> 03:26:09.690]  We had that hyperinflation in the 70s.
[03:26:10.469 --> 03:26:15.190]  And middle class families could no longer afford to live off a single income anymore.
[03:26:15.450 --> 03:26:30.510]  So, you know, 1950, you could graduate from high school, get a job as an electrician or a plumber, and get married by the time you're 20 and have kids and own your home by the time you're like 22. My parents were born in 1949. They were married and had a kid when they were 23. They're still married.
[03:26:31.229 --> 03:26:42.809]  And when the money just wasn't making ends meet, Then there was this cultural shift to try to make it acceptable for women to work too.
[03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:44.889]  It's not something to be ashamed of that you have to work, right?
[03:26:45.069 --> 03:26:56.450]  And I honestly think that the feminist movement was less about women's rights and more about a psychological cope with the fact that men could not make ends meet for their family anymore.
[03:26:56.690 --> 03:26:58.389]  And there was shame.
[03:26:59.030 --> 03:27:01.690]  And they didn't know why it was happening because it was gradual.
[03:27:02.559 --> 03:27:11.000]  And the feminist movement was a way for women to feel like There was nothing to be ashamed of in working.
[03:27:11.319 --> 03:27:13.100]  And I think it just doubled down too much.
[03:27:13.180 --> 03:27:14.920]  And I think it's deeply rooted in inflation.
[03:27:15.040 --> 03:27:16.159]  The same thing goes for men today.
[03:27:16.420 --> 03:27:21.159]  With inflation, as bad as it is, people hear about, that guy lives in his mom's basement.
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:21.819]  That guy lives in his dad.
[03:27:21.819 --> 03:27:23.680]  That's a common thing to say as a troll.
[03:27:23.780 --> 03:27:24.520]  I hate that phrase so much.
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:24.940]  I understand.
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:28.579]  And there are a lot of losers out there that just need to get off their ass.
[03:27:28.579 --> 03:27:28.959]  I understand.
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:32.020]  But there's a lot of people that work hard.
[03:27:32.399 --> 03:27:38.930]  They They get an education, they get good jobs after college, and they still live with their parents until they're almost 30. It's happening a lot.
[03:27:39.170 --> 03:27:46.770]  And it's because it's so expensive, especially in places like California and others, to actually get out on your own, so they want to save.
[03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:56.750]  And I think that has feminized men because we have unnaturally elongated a state of dependence in childhood.
[03:27:57.760 --> 03:27:59.360]  See, I'm gonna push back a little bit.
[03:27:59.620 --> 03:28:02.319]  This was one of the books that we talked about- She's never coming back, aren't you?
[03:28:02.780 --> 03:28:04.260]  And she was never seen again.
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:07.959]  We talked about this when we did our episode a while back.
[03:28:08.180 --> 03:28:14.020]  So that's actually relatively new, this idea of pushing them out of the nest or this whole failure to launch myth.
[03:28:14.219 --> 03:28:18.020]  So we used to have those compounds or family farms, so it wasn't- Yeah.
[03:28:18.479 --> 03:28:19.059]  Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[03:28:19.159 --> 03:28:31.100]  I think that's actually more of this weird, insidious move that someone made was to actually divide the family and to create smaller pieces of, quote, private property, because we know that doesn't really exist because of property taxes.
[03:28:31.340 --> 03:28:37.559]  But that was the initial division of the family, was actually isolating the different generations from one another.
[03:28:37.559 --> 03:28:39.459]  You were actually supposed to be more collective.
[03:28:48.449 --> 03:28:55.049]  Sure, and I didn't mean to imply that it's making people losers.
[03:28:55.350 --> 03:29:00.010]  I just think that psychologically it's important for a man as he comes of age.
[03:29:01.180 --> 03:29:05.399]  To develop a sense of individualism and self, regardless of economic status.
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:06.700]  You have to be comfortable with yourself.
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:08.219]  You have to be sure of yourself.
[03:29:08.379 --> 03:29:11.360]  You have to grow up and be an adult, regardless of whatever your economic status is.
[03:29:11.540 --> 03:29:24.799]  And I think when many men are Forced, because of the economy and the inflation, to be dependent on their parents for longer than they wanted.
[03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:27.579]  Not that parents should push them out.
[03:29:27.659 --> 03:29:29.719]  The problem is that there's no way out.
[03:29:29.879 --> 03:29:31.299]  It's not because your kid's deadbeat.
[03:29:31.540 --> 03:29:33.440]  How are they supposed to afford- They can't.
[03:29:33.760 --> 03:29:36.319]  How much does the average house cost in Orange County, California?
[03:29:36.479 --> 03:29:40.360]  That's why everybody there is 75, because you have to have saved up your whole life to even be able to afford to live there.
[03:29:40.700 --> 03:29:46.250]  And so I just- And I understand the familial aspect of housing.
[03:29:46.610 --> 03:29:47.850]  Italians are famous for this too.
[03:29:47.989 --> 03:29:52.790]  They lived longer even though they smoked because the whole family stayed together.
[03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:56.069]  But I think there was also a transition in who the man of the house was.
[03:29:56.209 --> 03:29:59.430]  Right, you nailed it when you said being dependent on.
[03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:01.329]  I don't mean to interrupt.
[03:30:02.690 --> 03:30:03.829]  Let me just interrupt for it.
[03:30:04.290 --> 03:30:05.229]  The hearing's ongoing.
[03:30:05.389 --> 03:30:06.409]  The judge said, I want to be clear.
[03:30:06.569 --> 03:30:07.709]  You did not buy Infowars.
[03:30:07.829 --> 03:30:08.729]  The sale did not go through.
[03:30:09.610 --> 03:30:10.909]  And he said a lot of other stuff.
[03:30:11.069 --> 03:30:14.350]  And let's just say it's a federal court, so I can't record it or show the video.
[03:30:14.590 --> 03:30:16.770]  But let's just say the bad guys are not happy.
[03:30:17.049 --> 03:30:19.049]  I'll be on with Owen after General Flynn at 3.30.
[03:30:19.489 --> 03:30:20.870]  With more details, I'm writing notes.
[03:30:21.010 --> 03:30:22.090]  But this is big.
[03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:24.170]  So, folks, we need your support.
[03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:26.610]  As long as we have money for legal defense, we are gonna win.
[03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:31.129]  Elon Musk has sued on our behalf and filed major motions today as well.
[03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:32.629]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:34.670]  But a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[03:30:34.829 --> 03:30:35.790]  I'll just stop right there.
[03:30:38.350 --> 03:30:40.450]  I'm just so glad I got a front row seat for that broadcast.
[03:30:41.229 --> 03:30:42.149]  That's some good stuff.
[03:30:44.049 --> 03:30:46.170]  This is what I mean when I say this place is like the Battle of Hoth.
[03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:48.049]  You never know what's gonna happen next.
[03:30:48.049 --> 03:30:52.010]  It's totally on the fly, unpredictable, and it's just all about free speech and the truth.
[03:30:52.110 --> 03:30:55.909]  But anyway, we were talking about the shifting in from- He's back.
[03:30:57.809 --> 03:30:58.430]  He's back.
[03:30:59.290 --> 03:31:00.170]  I'll just say this.
[03:31:00.290 --> 03:31:01.090]  Let's get another mic.
[03:31:01.290 --> 03:31:03.569]  Well, first my lawyers are like, you gotta go to Houston, don't go to Houston.
[03:31:03.649 --> 03:31:04.110]  Do you wanna sit down?
[03:31:04.729 --> 03:31:05.010]  Just do it.
[03:31:05.350 --> 03:31:05.770]  I'm sorry.
[03:31:07.370 --> 03:31:09.969]  The point is, we are at the heart of the fight for Western civilization.
[03:31:10.270 --> 03:31:11.209]  This is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:14.129]  The audience of activists that do this, you did this.
[03:31:14.329 --> 03:31:18.030]  The little stickers where it says Biden did this at the gas pump, well, you did this good stuff.
[03:31:18.209 --> 03:31:19.209]  We need your support.
[03:31:22.090 --> 03:31:22.909]  Beautifully said, Alex.
[03:31:24.350 --> 03:31:25.389]  So what do you think about that?
[03:31:25.569 --> 03:31:26.290]  Do you think we're gonna be all right?
[03:31:26.409 --> 03:31:28.229]  Do you think Alex is still gonna be employed next week?
[03:31:28.430 --> 03:31:28.870]  I do.
[03:31:29.129 --> 03:31:29.889]  I have faith.
[03:31:29.989 --> 03:31:32.250]  Like I said, I think when you're in alignment, things work out.
[03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:33.020]  Yeah.
[03:31:33.540 --> 03:31:36.659]  And that's something I've learned as I've grown up.
[03:31:36.899 --> 03:31:39.379]  I'm so grateful that I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.
[03:31:39.659 --> 03:31:42.520]  I have a lot of problems with Ayn Rand now when I look back, but...
[03:31:44.430 --> 03:31:53.829]  The fountainhead really convinces you of this philosophy, especially if you're coming of age as a man reading it, of how important it is to have integrity to yourself.
[03:31:54.190 --> 03:32:02.649]  It's anti-collectivist, it's anti-self-sacrifice, and it's all about doing what's true to yourself no matter what the repercussions are.
[03:32:02.850 --> 03:32:05.670]  And if they're terrible, it's still worth it because you didn't sell out.
[03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:12.149]  And as I've grown up, I've really seen it play out because there's so many things that I've done, especially in the last three or four years.
[03:32:12.829 --> 03:32:27.450]  That to everyone else and myself seemed totally irrational, like quitting a job to start a business and then shutting down the business to start a podcast and then getting a job at a company that's in bankruptcy, right?
[03:32:27.889 --> 03:32:31.350]  But then I just did it because it was what I wanted to do.
[03:32:31.649 --> 03:32:35.389]  Like, all right, this is what I would rather do, so I'm just going to do it and whatever.
[03:32:35.629 --> 03:32:39.649]  And it seems to work out better that way than when you just kind of comply and do whatever you're told.
[03:32:39.649 --> 03:32:40.069]  I don't know.
[03:32:40.600 --> 03:32:45.540]  How do you make that distinction or how do you feel whether it's intuition, right?
[03:32:45.620 --> 03:32:52.719]  Cuz I think sometimes you get presented options that are a distraction to say, do you really want whatever your mission is and are you gonna stay on the path?
[03:32:53.079 --> 03:32:54.620]  And then sometimes you're presented with opportunities.
[03:32:54.799 --> 03:32:57.799]  So how do you distinguish between distraction and opportunity?
[03:32:58.260 --> 03:32:59.420]  That's a really good question.
[03:33:00.260 --> 03:33:06.329]  For me, So I grew up with, I've got severe hemophilia, it's a bleeding disorder.
[03:33:06.829 --> 03:33:10.709]  And I have to take medicine a few times a week in order for my blood to clot.
[03:33:10.989 --> 03:33:11.930]  Internal bleeding is a problem.
[03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:19.170]  Without medicine, hemophilia actually usually died about 11 years old from internal bleeding and then eventually their organs swell up and they suffocate and it's bad.
[03:33:20.329 --> 03:33:25.190]  And so when I was growing up, I was not allowed to do a lot of things that other kids were allowed to do.
[03:33:25.290 --> 03:33:26.370]  I wasn't allowed to play basketball.
[03:33:26.610 --> 03:33:27.350]  I wasn't allowed to play football.
[03:33:27.409 --> 03:33:33.790]  So I just kind of was shuffled into the, hey, you can read a book or you can join the chess club, but you're not going to be in sports, right?
[03:33:34.629 --> 03:33:37.969]  And when you grow up in that environment, I loved my childhood.
[03:33:37.969 --> 03:33:38.969]  I'm not complaining at all.
[03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:43.270]  But I was prematurely given a sense of my mortality.
[03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:48.450]  Most men feel invincible and mortal until they start having back pain in their 30s or whatever.
[03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:55.250]  And I knew very well that I was definitely going to die one day by the time I was seven years old.
[03:33:55.409 --> 03:33:58.850]  Because it was just instilled in me how fragile I was.
[03:33:58.989 --> 03:34:00.250]  I was like the porcelain kid, right?
[03:34:00.809 --> 03:34:11.430]  And so that being said, My motivation is disproportionately about how I'm gonna feel about myself on my deathbed.
[03:34:11.610 --> 03:34:18.909]  I think a lot about, all right, what am I gonna think of myself now when I'm dying in my 60s or 70s?
[03:34:19.049 --> 03:34:24.129]  Because I've just known for longer than most people know in a very fundamental, intuitive way that I'm gonna die.
[03:34:24.430 --> 03:34:27.030]  And so it's mostly about conscience for me.
[03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:30.729]  And I don't care about failure at all.
[03:34:31.559 --> 03:34:34.399]  And I honestly just don't really care what anybody else thinks.
[03:34:34.979 --> 03:34:37.700]  But I'm very, very concerned with letting myself down.
[03:34:39.319 --> 03:34:42.860]  And that's been my primary motivator.
[03:34:42.959 --> 03:34:45.340]  So if it's like, all right, am I gonna take this job or this job?
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:47.020]  Or am I gonna take this opportunity or this opportunity?
[03:34:47.659 --> 03:34:50.760]  All right, well, Chase, how are you gonna feel about this 50 years from now?
[03:34:50.940 --> 03:34:53.260]  And it's steered me in a pretty good direction.
[03:34:53.719 --> 03:34:54.340]  What do you think?
[03:34:54.420 --> 03:34:54.799]  What about you?
[03:34:54.899 --> 03:34:57.239]  How do you determine between distractions and opportunity?
[03:34:58.670 --> 03:35:01.049]  I mean, you just have to be radically self-aware.
[03:35:01.329 --> 03:35:07.709]  So you have to have people around you that can point out maybe some patterns that you fall into or some traps that you fall into often.
[03:35:08.469 --> 03:35:17.170]  Have awareness about maybe unconscious drivers and then look at those and see if they're in alignment of whatever your highest version of yourself is, like that ideal.
[03:35:18.270 --> 03:35:21.930]  So how do you discover that without winding up a mess?
[03:35:23.159 --> 03:35:24.139]  We don't want to live there.
[03:35:24.559 --> 03:35:35.139]  I think that's the problem with a lot of people is that they're too much in their head and they're too intellectual and they're constantly dissecting every single little thing and trying to find meaning in these minute things instead of looking at the bigger picture.
[03:35:35.280 --> 03:35:36.600]  So missing the forest for the trees.
[03:35:36.739 --> 03:35:43.379]  I think it's important to periodically dive in deep, assess, kind of get your vitals of the moment and then have a plan and move forward.
[03:35:43.700 --> 03:35:50.639]  So I think it's the people that get stuck in the process of it that it's not good, but I think you should constantly be self-auditing, especially if you're a parent.
[03:35:51.700 --> 03:35:52.780]  What do you think about therapy?
[03:35:53.549 --> 03:35:54.350]  And it's nonsense.
[03:35:55.149 --> 03:35:55.870]  I really do.
[03:35:56.110 --> 03:36:01.489]  So I'm a big fan of having maybe a personal development coach, right?
[03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:03.090]  Because they don't let you go into the past.
[03:36:03.209 --> 03:36:04.329]  There's no victim mentality.
[03:36:04.489 --> 03:36:05.309]  It's like, who are you now?
[03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:06.790]  What do you want to do with the information that you have?
[03:36:06.850 --> 03:36:07.649]  And what's your future goal?
[03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:08.829]  So it's very future oriented.
[03:36:09.850 --> 03:36:11.750]  It's not like- How much do you want to make a month?
[03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:12.610]  And tell me about your mother.
[03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:16.690]  Yeah, there's no wallowing, basically, if you have a personal development coach.
[03:36:16.829 --> 03:36:19.950]  I think when it comes to therapy, so much of it is focused on the past.
[03:36:20.110 --> 03:36:24.690]  I tend to be more in Adlerian psychology, which the premise is there is no past, right?
[03:36:24.770 --> 03:36:30.750]  There is no past, there is no future, there's only this ever-present moment of constantly now, now, now, now, now.
[03:36:31.030 --> 03:36:35.489]  So what you do is you take the information that you have at hand and then just decide what is the next step.
[03:36:35.549 --> 03:36:37.829]  What's the next step in alignment and who do I want to be?
[03:36:38.520 --> 03:36:44.020]  That's actually a fairly Christian principle too because Jesus said don't worry about tomorrow for today has enough troubles of its own.
[03:36:44.459 --> 03:36:44.860]  Exactly.
[03:36:45.219 --> 03:36:48.299]  And I think that's where a lot of neurosis comes in too, right?
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:57.360]  Is constantly living in the future or thinking about all these things that could possibly go wrong when most of the time I think it's 90% or in the high 90s it never actually comes to fruition.
[03:36:57.639 --> 03:36:58.860]  So it's wasted energy.
[03:36:59.079 --> 03:37:00.399]  And even if it does, who cares?
[03:37:00.860 --> 03:37:02.020]  Right, you deal with it when it happens.
[03:37:02.079 --> 03:37:02.239]  Right.
[03:37:02.500 --> 03:37:03.120]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:17.459]  Wow, so if you could give anybody in the audience advice about how to become the person that they want to be, how to reach self-actualization, what would you say?
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:21.780]  Well, I don't know that I've reached it yet, so I think it's all a journey and it's all a path.
[03:37:22.500 --> 03:37:24.299]  You seem very intentional about it though.
[03:37:24.459 --> 03:37:34.909]  I try to be intentional with everything I do, absolutely, because there was a long time When I was younger, where you just start making decisions that are fleeting and based off of emotion or really shallow things.
[03:37:35.170 --> 03:37:42.350]  And you don't actually have principles or values or an idea of what is the most I am capable of doing while I'm here, right?
[03:37:42.610 --> 03:37:45.290]  It's kind of this very hedonistic way to live life.
[03:37:45.290 --> 03:37:45.409]  Sure.
[03:37:46.770 --> 03:37:53.069]  I think when you get reconnected with yourself, with God, with your soul, with consciousness, it becomes abundantly clear.
[03:37:53.290 --> 03:38:06.510]  So it's all of these things that we distract ourself with, whether it's anything too hedonistic or anything that's too superficial, or even the food that you're eating and the things that you're consuming digitally, all of these things have an effect on you.
[03:38:06.610 --> 03:38:08.309]  So you kind of have to do a bit of a detox.
[03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:22.030]  And like find yourself and I think that's where you have those gut feelings or you kind of feel a push or you start to almost see it's the word is overused so much, but you'll kind of see this matrix or the simulation where like all of these things, there's no way that these are coincidental.
[03:38:22.190 --> 03:38:28.790]  This seems like almost something divine that's intervening and then you just see it like a map and you just try to stay on course.
[03:38:30.930 --> 03:38:32.950]  For me, it's getting out of a victim mentality.
[03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:34.129]  It's the first thing you gotta do.
[03:38:34.450 --> 03:38:35.870]  You gotta get out of it.
[03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:38.069]  The buck stops with you.
[03:38:38.190 --> 03:38:40.629]  It doesn't matter how horrific the thing that happened.
[03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:41.350]  It happened.
[03:38:41.909 --> 03:38:42.530]  Accept it.
[03:38:42.629 --> 03:38:43.610]  You're not gonna change it.
[03:38:43.709 --> 03:38:45.129]  Now, what can I do with this?
[03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:46.829]  What decisions am I gonna make?
[03:38:47.350 --> 03:38:51.709]  And trying to find- You can't change your environment or what happens to you, but you can determine how you respond to it.
[03:38:51.729 --> 03:38:53.090]  Right, and find the good in it.
[03:38:53.170 --> 03:39:00.590]  No matter how awful it is, find the gift in the rubble, and then take that with you to the next stage of your development.
[03:39:00.809 --> 03:39:12.370]  So yeah, I think radical self-awareness, not being a victim, surrounding yourself with good people, being process-oriented, but still having clear visions and goals is important.
[03:39:13.140 --> 03:39:14.159]  Contribution is massive.
[03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:16.260]  So two things can be true at once.
[03:39:16.379 --> 03:39:18.399]  You can serve yourself and also other people.
[03:39:18.659 --> 03:39:21.600]  So I think where you get into trouble too is when everything is just for yourself.
[03:39:21.780 --> 03:39:22.479]  It's just very greedy.
[03:39:22.620 --> 03:39:26.159]  How can I get to the next rung of this ladder?
[03:39:26.319 --> 03:39:27.979]  That's really gross to me and I see it a lot.
[03:39:28.040 --> 03:39:30.020]  I'm sure you do too in the creator economy.
[03:39:30.479 --> 03:39:33.860]  If you approach things with contribution, I think the rest follows that.
[03:39:33.979 --> 03:39:35.979]  So how can I be of service to my audience?
[03:39:36.159 --> 03:39:41.760]  How can I leave something where the world is a little bit better because I contributed in some kind of way?
[03:39:42.549 --> 03:39:47.370]  If you had to guess what the United States or the world is gonna look like by 2050, what would you say?
[03:39:48.610 --> 03:39:52.950]  My goodness, 2050. It feels like that's very far, but I know that it's not.
[03:39:52.969 --> 03:39:54.469]  It's gonna be like a blink of an eye.
[03:39:54.690 --> 03:39:54.770]  I know.
[03:39:57.180 --> 03:39:58.860]  I honestly, I have no clue.
[03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:11.139]  I think that what I see happening is this awakening, is this emphasis on sovereignty, on freedom, kind of going back to our founding values of this country.
[03:40:11.340 --> 03:40:12.340]  And I think it's going to win.
[03:40:12.479 --> 03:40:16.180]  I think that idea is going to win and those values are going to win.
[03:40:16.299 --> 03:40:24.360]  So I would like to see more people standing up for the power of the people and start to see some of these inflamed institutions shrink.
[03:40:24.620 --> 03:40:25.799]  And I think we're seeing that now.
[03:40:30.500 --> 03:40:31.840]  The Department of Government Efficiency?
[03:40:32.159 --> 03:40:33.579]  Yes, I mean, well, that's amazing.
[03:40:33.719 --> 03:40:44.200]  But I think when you start to see the benefits of these things actually happening, then it's going to be harder to deny or harder to believe in the man behind the current or the projections of the man behind the current.
[03:40:44.340 --> 03:40:44.719]  Do you know what I mean?
[03:40:44.959 --> 03:40:45.520]  Sure, absolutely.
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:49.739]  Yeah, so once the normal people start to see the benefits of this, there's not going to be going back.
[03:40:49.940 --> 03:40:59.110]  But the better Trump did after he was elected the first time, I didn't like his fourth year very much, but hindsight is 20-20 with the pandemic.
[03:40:59.370 --> 03:41:00.329]  The first three were great.
[03:41:00.549 --> 03:41:00.930]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:41:01.069 --> 03:41:06.030]  It seemed like the better he did and the more he proved that his policies were superior, the more they hated him.
[03:41:06.290 --> 03:41:10.930]  It's like they want good to fail.
[03:41:11.250 --> 03:41:16.030]  They don't even want America to be successful, certainly not as much as they just want to be right.
[03:41:16.569 --> 03:41:17.370]  Well, that's true.
[03:41:17.530 --> 03:41:22.430]  But what I've seen lately in the last year or so is more people that are coming out of hiding.
[03:41:22.569 --> 03:41:25.649]  They're almost coming out of the closet and saying, no, these are my values too.
[03:41:25.870 --> 03:41:29.590]  And it's almost like the four minute mile, right?
[03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:31.909]  So you have one person that sees what's possible.
[03:41:32.270 --> 03:41:32.829]  Right, and everybody can do it.
[03:41:32.909 --> 03:41:33.870]  And then everyone can do it.
[03:41:33.989 --> 03:41:35.850]  So I think that is really important as well.
[03:41:36.049 --> 03:41:36.750]  So I do agree.
[03:41:36.909 --> 03:41:40.469]  I think for a minute there was almost everything kind of has an opposite equal reaction.
[03:41:40.649 --> 03:41:46.329]  So people were kind of like imagine when you're sick or you get a shot or something, you almost have this autoimmune response.
[03:41:46.569 --> 03:41:47.670]  And I think that's what we were seeing.
[03:41:47.809 --> 03:41:50.569]  So the pushback was almost this autoimmune response collectively.
[03:41:50.930 --> 03:41:55.729]  And then once that faded, you're like, you have all these healthy blood cells that are coming out and saying, no, this is actually a good thing.
[03:41:56.370 --> 03:42:01.129]  Wow, so civilization is really like a macro organism.
[03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:05.370]  It's like one organism, and man, let me go into the practice stuff.
[03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:06.450]  It blew my mind the other day.
[03:42:06.729 --> 03:42:09.510]  I don't know how I came across this, and I can't believe I didn't see it earlier.
[03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:10.790]  I talked about it a little bit last night.
[03:42:11.399 --> 03:42:13.579]  Are you familiar with the remote viewing, Stargate stuff?
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:15.899]  I have a guy, I keep talking to Alex about him.
[03:42:16.059 --> 03:42:20.760]  I know the guy that actually did the training for these government agencies for remote viewing.
[03:42:20.780 --> 03:42:21.639]  It's demonic, Candace.
[03:42:22.219 --> 03:42:24.079]  No, no, no, not necessarily.
[03:42:24.459 --> 03:42:25.280]  I don't know that it is either.
[03:42:25.399 --> 03:42:26.639]  I just like to say that it is.
[03:42:26.719 --> 03:42:27.739]  I think like everything else, right?
[03:42:27.879 --> 03:42:30.260]  If the capability is there, it can be used for good or evil.
[03:42:30.399 --> 03:42:31.079]  Everything is a tool.
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:32.600]  So intention matters greatly.
[03:42:32.819 --> 03:42:37.540]  And I think if you knew this guy, him and Alex will be best friends once they meet.
[03:42:37.719 --> 03:42:40.100]  They agree on their worldview is so similar.
[03:42:40.219 --> 03:42:45.120]  But I think, yeah, people can use something for evil and then people can also have that same weapon for good.
[03:42:45.299 --> 03:42:46.860]  But yeah, I think remote viewing is real.
[03:42:46.979 --> 03:42:48.040]  I know the guy that did the training.
[03:42:48.040 --> 03:42:49.280]  I would love to connect you guys.
[03:42:49.379 --> 03:42:49.899]  He's amazing.
[03:42:50.139 --> 03:42:51.459]  I'd love to talk to him, absolutely.
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:56.559]  But I came across this declassified transcript of a remote viewing session.
[03:42:56.680 --> 03:43:00.100]  What they would do is they'd have an interviewer, and then they would have the person that would do the remote viewing.
[03:43:00.239 --> 03:43:05.379]  And they gave the guy four coordinates, just numbers, coordinates, literally GPS coordinates.
[03:43:06.079 --> 03:43:13.379]  And they just asked him to start describing what he was seeing, and he was describing this civilization that was in decline because of some major...
[03:43:14.780 --> 03:43:22.639]  It's a geologic issue in the region that they were in, and they were in giant pyramids, and they were hibernating, and they tried to send people out to find a safer place to live.
[03:43:22.799 --> 03:43:26.719]  It's basically the story of Littlefoot, or Land Before Time.
[03:43:28.430 --> 03:43:38.629]  And then they told him after the whole session, it's amazing, nine pages of him describing this conversation he's having with these people, that the prompt in the envelope was they were coordinates of Mars a million years ago.
[03:43:38.969 --> 03:43:42.969]  So they'd seen some structures on the surface of the planet back in 1984 when they did this session.
[03:43:43.450 --> 03:43:47.170]  And they just wanted to know what was going on at those structures a million years ago.
[03:43:47.409 --> 03:43:49.229]  And this guy had no idea he was talking about Mars.
[03:43:49.290 --> 03:43:51.469]  He just saw four numbers, and then you go into a state.
[03:43:52.370 --> 03:43:53.829]  It's creepy, it's creepy stuff.
[03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:56.090]  But if everything is consciousness, right?
[03:43:56.149 --> 03:44:00.370]  If everything is a frequency or a wave, then you should kind of be able to tap into that.
[03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:01.430]  So what is an idea?
[03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:05.229]  It's just a vibration, it's a frequency.
[03:44:05.569 --> 03:44:18.389]  And then you have these examples throughout history where the same Same wild invention that hasn't existed before will kind of come up, let's say, in America, in Europe, and in Asia at the same time.
[03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:24.030]  And it's almost like something divine or God is saying, one of you figure this out because this is really important for your species.
[03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:26.469]  And whoever does, it's going to change the world.
[03:44:26.489 --> 03:44:29.370]  But it's too valuable to give to only one person.
[03:44:29.370 --> 03:44:32.409]  So I'm going to actually spread my odds a little bit.
[03:44:32.569 --> 03:44:34.329]  Well, I think there's a collective unconscious too.
[03:44:34.430 --> 03:44:35.690]  So people call it the zeitgeist.
[03:44:36.129 --> 03:44:53.510]  But I really do think there is Like a singular human consciousness that's very subtle and intuitive and irrational that everybody is participating in regardless of whether they're even connected geographically at all.
[03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:55.530]  No, absolutely, because we know quantum entanglement, right?
[03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.850]  Exactly.
[03:44:56.190 --> 03:44:58.870]  They won the Nobel Prize, what, three years ago?
[03:44:59.190 --> 03:44:59.770]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:44:59.889 --> 03:45:04.790]  Yeah, so I think science is catching up to what a lot of the spiritual people have known forever, right?
[03:45:04.909 --> 03:45:06.329]  We are all connected.
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:08.959]  That's a beautiful thing about pursuing truth.
[03:45:09.399 --> 03:45:13.100]  You always kind of wind up closer to it as long as you're honest.
[03:45:13.719 --> 03:45:15.620]  Well, hey, we've only got 30 seconds left.
[03:45:15.780 --> 03:45:17.139]  Candace, it's an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[03:45:17.319 --> 03:45:17.799]  Great job.
[03:45:17.959 --> 03:45:20.540]  I love your podcast, chattingwithcandace.com.
[03:45:20.620 --> 03:45:22.299]  Make sure you follow her on X as well.
[03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:25.100]  And please go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:45:25.219 --> 03:45:29.860]  I cannot wait to talk to Alex after this broadcast and find out what the heck is going on with this major hearing.
[03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:36.680]  Your support ensures that this operation has stayed on the air and it will ensure that no matter what happens to Infowars, Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[03:45:36.799 --> 03:45:40.000]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com right now and save America.
[03:45:40.479 --> 03:45:55.760]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, Infowars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public.
[03:45:59.969 --> 03:46:05.170]  And people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[03:46:05.690 --> 03:46:09.549]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:10.209]  Who knows?
[03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:13.170]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[03:46:13.469 --> 03:46:19.309]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved, filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[03:46:19.979 --> 03:46:27.799]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[03:46:28.059 --> 03:46:32.239]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[03:46:32.379 --> 03:46:46.649]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjohnstore.com With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network where we won't miss a beat.
[03:46:46.829 --> 03:47:01.389]  If you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[03:47:01.819 --> 03:47:05.600]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[03:47:05.719 --> 03:47:06.940]  But that's going to get announced.
[03:47:07.100 --> 03:47:09.159]  The winner here in just a few days.
[03:47:09.319 --> 03:47:13.360]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[03:47:13.459 --> 03:47:15.000]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[03:47:15.180 --> 03:47:16.840]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[03:47:17.059 --> 03:47:17.959]  So now...
[03:47:18.340 --> 03:47:26.020]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:26.399 --> 03:47:31.920]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:47:32.139 --> 03:47:33.379]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:34.540]  It's a beautiful truck.
