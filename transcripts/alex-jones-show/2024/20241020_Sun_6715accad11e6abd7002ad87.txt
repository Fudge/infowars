[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.980]  It was confirmed yesterday morning by the White House that indeed U.S. intelligence has Israel's battle plan shared with them by Israel to strike Iran with a heavy bombardment inside Iran and their military bases and their nuclear facilities before the election.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.000]  That's sometime in the next 15 days.
[00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:28.839]  Now, if we knew about this Friday and the White House admitted it Saturday, do you think North Korea knew six days ago, seven days ago when they blew up?
[00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:41.030]  The highways and roads and bridges and rail lines over the DMC and that river between South and North Korea?
[00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:54.289]  Do you think when Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist dictator for life, came out Saturday and said, prepare for total war with the West, do you think they're talking about that?
[00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:11.250]  Israel's plan to attack their ally, Iran, and I'm no fan of the Mullahs, but they've been extremely restrained in Israel, cleaning their clock, killing their proxy leaders, just doing a show of force with some missiles that,
[00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:12.790]  thank God, didn't kill anybody.
[00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.709]  Remember Netanyahu said he will do an investigation of October 7th once the war is over.
[00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:29.370]  Well, let's hope the world's not over by the time we find out why Israel stood down for seven and a half hours on October 7th, which doesn't lessen what Hezbollah did backing Hamas.
[00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.689]  And I said it was Iran the whole time, obviously.
[00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.920]  But there's a lot of geopolitical wrangling going on right now, and the end of the old financial order is here.
[00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.540]  And so Russia and China and the BRICS wanted to be their new cashless central bank digital currency, social credit score.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.680]  And the United States, what's left for the British Empire in Europe, the Anglo-American establishment, the Five Eyes, have got their plan.
[00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.840]  And what happens in history in World War I and World War II and big wars before that, when big financial interest...
[00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.209]  Are clashing and clashing what Ivan Bismarck said.
[00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.950]  He said war is an extension of politics by other means.
[00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.930]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.469]  It's Sunday, October 20th, 2024.
[00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:29.550]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled Infowars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.009]  And the intensity of the attacks on this independent pro-human Team Humanity broadcast are emblematic and are just symptoms of the larger attacks on humanity.
[00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:45.069]  We are 15 days, 7 hours, 53 minutes, 6 seconds, the most important election in world history.
[00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.469]  Then, President Trump will be president-elect, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.289]  In 91 days, he'll be sworn in.
[00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:59.310]  But in the 76 days, when he is president-elect, the Democrats have prepared for martial law.
[00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.169]  And the implementation of US troops on the streets, seizing control of all infrastructure, and the killing of Americans.
[00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.849]  It's all public.
[00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.770]  I warned you of this for decades.
[00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.389]  And now, the secret plans they've been constructing and building and perfecting in the shadows are being revealed.
[00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.830]  The knife, the dagger, the sword of tyranny has been unsheathed and is now pointing at the heart of our republic and the entire world.
[00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.490]  And that's not hype what I just said.
[00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.530]  That's the point in history that we are alive right now.
[00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.810]  So, yeah, we're not in the final countdown to some wonderful thing here, are we?
[00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:56.830]  We're in the final countdown to a collapsing globalist elite that wants to keep total control, not just over us, but the rest of the world, that has good people, bad people, horrible people like the Communist Chinese, ready to go to war with them because the Anglo-American establishment, that's what they call themselves,
[00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.990]  doesn't mean white people, it's the name of the British Empire merged with the United States Empire in their own documents.
[00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.430]  Putin refers to it as the Anglo-American elite.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.219]  They think they run the entire world, and they are the big alpha predator.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.599]  They've got the most money, the most weapons, the most propaganda, and they got us under their boot.
[00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:21.160]  But we are wiggling out from under it right now and biting on the boot, not licking the boot.
[00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.779]  All right.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.480]  In just the last 36 hours, it has been confirmed what broke three days ago.
[00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.779]  Pentagon leaked documents, big national security investigation.
[00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.439]  The White House confirms it's true.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.259]  They would have denied it if they weren't the ones that leaked it.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.779]  I'll explain in a moment my perspective and view on that.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.540]  I don't know that for sure, but you can bet the farm on it.
[00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.720]  That the White House, and this is a real staple when they say this, does not want Israel to bomb Iran proper.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.800]  Because they know what that means and what that's going to trigger.
[00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:13.540]  So they're really upset that That Netanyahu, to stay in power, has already taken out the main enemies and proxies of Iran around Israel before they go after Israel itself.
[00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.540]  We talked about this on Friday before it was confirmed.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.740]  I said I thought it was probably accurate.
[00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.079]  It hit the foreign news.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.240]  The secret documents were leaked on Telegram.
[00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:43.610]  And now it was confirmed yesterday morning by the White House that indeed U.S. intelligence has Israel's battle plan shared with them by Israel to strike Iran with a heavy bombardment inside Iran and their military bases and their nuclear facilities before the election.
[00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.629]  That's sometime in the next 15 days.
[00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:56.490]  Now, if we knew about this Friday and the White House admitted it Saturday, do you think North Korea knew six days ago, seven days ago when they blew up?
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:08.680]  The highways and roads and bridges and rail lines over the DMC and that river between South and North Korea?
[00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:21.939]  Do you think when Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist dictator for life, came out Saturday and said, prepare for total war with the West, do you think they're talking about that?
[00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:38.889]  Israel's plan to attack their ally, Iran, and I'm no fan of the Mullahs, but they've been extremely restrained in Israel, cleaning their clock, killing their proxy leaders, just doing a show of force with some missiles that,
[00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.389]  thank God, didn't kill anybody.
[00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:47.360]  Remember Netanyahu said he will do an investigation of October 7th once the war is over.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:57.019]  Well, let's hope the world's not over by the time we find out why Israel stood down for seven and a half hours on October 7th, which doesn't lessen what Hezbollah did backing Hamas.
[00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.339]  And I said it was Iran the whole time, obviously.
[00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.329]  But there's a lot of geopolitical wrangling going on right now.
[00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.569]  And the end of the old financial order is here.
[00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.170]  And so Russia and China and the BRICS wanted to be their new cashless central bank digital currency, social credit score.
[00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:20.329]  And the United States, what's left for the British Empire and Europe, the Anglo-American establishment, the Five Eyes, have got their plan.
[00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.490]  And what happens in history in World War I and World War II and big wars before that, when big financial interest...
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:38.259]  I believe that was von Bismarck.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.439]  My memory sometimes fails.
[00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:41.180]  It used to be photographic.
[00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.680]  It's not anymore.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.399]  It's still really good.
[00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.339]  Guys, look up.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.139]  War is an extension of politics by other means.
[00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.120]  I believe that's von Bismarck, but others have said similar things, and it's true.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.139]  There's other quotes that war is an extension of business and politics.
[00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:03.639]  So, you have Israel getting ready to strike Iran proper, and Israel's already promised they are.
[00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:09.560]  Then, you know, he said, you know, when the time is right, they'll decide and pull those clips up in the last few months.
[00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.660]  Oh, we will strike Iran proper.
[00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:12.920]  That is the nation of Iran.
[00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.519]  But we'll pick the time in the best way.
[00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.420]  Probably said it ten times I've seen him on TV say it.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.000]  Hell, he said it to Congress.
[00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:22.920]  But would that be enough?
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.240]  Now, Carl...
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.079]  One Klawitz.
[00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.399]  That's another one that said it.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.899]  So, another German statesman.
[00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:43.059]  But the point is, is that enough to get Xi Jinping to say prepare for imminent war?
[00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:55.970]  Probably, because of the defense agreements they've got, both Russia and China with Iran, that if it struck proper, they would then respond.
[00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.789]  But what else would do it?
[00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:14.850]  Well, it broke a week ago in Bild, the most respected publication in Germany, and by that, most corporate media is not very respectable, and Bild still puts out social propaganda, but when they report news, it's usually accurate, and Bild talked to senior NATO and EU diplomats that said...
[00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:32.269]  That NATO's looking at basically giving nuclear weapons to Ukraine in the next two weeks so they can threaten to use them on Russia if Russia doesn't leave, and that, oh, don't worry, there's plausible liability because they can just say that because of the nuclear reactors that Ukraine has,
[00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:33.769]  that they could build their own.
[00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.429]  Wink, wink.
[00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:40.519]  Kind of like when the West got caught blowing up Nord Stream pipeline a few years ago, they now blame Ukraine.
[00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.740]  They need that plausible deniability.
[00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:48.419]  Like China has always just come out in policy reports, said they would use North Korea as the trigger on the world stage.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.460]  A conflict there to launch nuclear war, total war, just like they did back during the Korean War in the 50s.
[00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:02.899]  And that was a war between the United States and China.
[00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:04.120]  And we're still at war.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.899]  It was just a ceasefire.
[00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:10.220]  Zelensky calls for nukes, then denies a nuke plan.
[00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:14.259]  But Hungary believes he will trigger nuclear war, World War III. Here's the headlines.
[00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.840]  First Ukraine nuke ready in weeks.
[00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:21.000]  Build reports.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.500]  So Zelensky a few weeks ago saying, I'm going to have nukes soon.
[00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:26.639]  I'm going to get nukes.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.940]  And then I was like, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.720]  We don't have nukes.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.600]  We're not getting nukes.
[00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.649]  And I've told you for years, Saudi Arabia has nukes.
[00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:34.669]  Iran has nukes.
[00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:39.769]  Now South Korea wants nukes.
[00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.909]  They're handing them out like hotcakes.
[00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.110]  Israel still claims they don't have nukes.
[00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:47.850]  They've got thousands.
[00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.629]  That's been confirmed.
[00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.549]  That goes back to JFK. Right around that time, they got them in 1963.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.820]  So, you talk about a Mexican standoff, that's where everybody's pointing guns at each other and nobody wins.
[00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:03.700]  That's mutually assured destruction.
[00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.419]  So, look at this overhead shot right here.
[00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:15.740]  Chinese President Xi Jinping orders military to prepare for war.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.779]  Chinese President Xi Jinping orders military to prepare for war.
[00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.830]  Xi Jinping asks troops prepare for war as battle drills intensify around Taiwan.
[00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.289]  Xi Jinping orders Chinese troops to boost war preparedness.
[00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.490]  China's Xi calls for troops to boost war preparedness.
[00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.710]  AP, Reuters, all of it.
[00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:45.789]  North Korea threatens to declare war.
[00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.590]  China slams illegal U.S. sanctions.
[00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:51.750]  South Korea needs nukes.
[00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:02.940]  Leaked documents show U.S. intelligence on Israel's plans to attack Iran, sources say, CNN, before the election.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.399]  Iran warns U.S. over Israeli strikes.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.440]  Iran, weakened by attacks on its allies, braces for Israeli strikes.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.139]  Has Iran just tested a nuclear weapon?
[00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:29.159]  They had a big earthquake in a region, and the seismologist that looked at it, it's been reported all over the news, said that it looks like An atomic or hydrogen weapon was detonated underground,
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.620]  creating a 4.6 on the Richter scale detected in the Siman region.
[00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:42.679]  U.S. government leaks Israeli strike plans to Iran.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.879]  That's really what happened.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.960]  Great report by Raw Egg Nationalists at InfoWars.com.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.779]  That really breaks it down.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.980]  Netanyahu promises retaliation following an assassination attempt on his home with a drone.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.620]  Fox News.
[00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:56.649]  Hezbollah drones target Netanyahu's home.
[00:12:57.049 --> 00:12:59.190]  He says, agents of Iran try to assassinate me.
[00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:03.149]  Blowback, how Israel went from helping Hamas to bombing it.
[00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.350]  How Israel decimated Hamas and Hezbollah leadership in three months.
[00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.750]  Israel's historical role in the rise of Hamas.
[00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:11.909]  This is all mainstream news.
[00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:19.750]  Okay, so that's just some of what's going on there.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.019]  Just to give you an idea, this is all unprecedented.
[00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:37.759]  This is the greatest combination of crises we've seen that even mainline historical analysts say is the signature of a new world war.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.840]  And then I mentioned this.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.240]  Here it is.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.899]  First, Ukraine nuke ready in weeks.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.159]  Bill newspaper reports from diplomat sources in NATO and the European Union.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.000]  And then we've got articles pushing it.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.779]  Ukraine could rebuild nuclear arsenal after Clinton Obama disarmed it.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.360]  Well, it was always part of Russia's arsenal, which was taken out at the end of the Cold War.
[00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:00.759]  And of course, you know, they kept a few.
[00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:04.320]  German news publication claims Ukraine could have nuclear weapons within weeks.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.639]  Germany and the UK signed a historic defense pact.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.320]  Over 100 Ukrainian drones down just last night attacking Russia.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.899]  Starting to see how this war is just spiraling quickly.
[00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:20.559]  Out of control.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:27.379]  Now, I don't normally play clips, but it's a short clip that are in a foreign language but has subtitles.
[00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.580]  But this is historic enough.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.279]  I'm going to play it in the Mandarin Chinese.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.139]  And again, TV viewers can read the subtitles, but I don't like to tell you something this big.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.740]  I like to actually show you it so it's on record, kind of like the media will say, Trump said he hates all Mexicans.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.340]  Where's the clip?
[00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:48.029]  Doesn't exist.
[00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.649]  Trump says he used the military on citizens.
[00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.529]  Doesn't exist.
[00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:54.470]  Or Alex Jones said go pee on dead kids' graves.
[00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:55.070]  Where's the clip?
[00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:55.570]  Doesn't exist.
[00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:59.490]  So I'm not like the corporate media that tells you something but doesn't show it to you.
[00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:15.389]  Here is Xi Jinping yesterday addressing the Combined Armed Forces of China, the largest military on Earth, second largest Navy on Earth, with the third largest nuclear arsenal on Earth, with submarines off our coast, saying prepare for imminent war.
[00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.830]  Here it is.
[00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:28.049]  Today, I'm going to go to the military center of the military.
[00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.210]  I'm going to show you how to do it.
[00:15:34.430 --> 00:16:19.690]  The 20th century military [...] 全军要贯彻新时代党的强军思想贯彻新时代军事战略方针坚持战斗力这个唯一的根本的标准全部精力向打仗聚焦全部工作向打仗用尽加快提高打赢能力坚决捍卫国家主权安全发展意义完成好党和人民富裕的各项任务
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.740]  Alright, so that's put out by the Chinese Communist government itself.
[00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:30.200]  Ukraine can build bombs in a few weeks, nuclear bombs, atomic bombs.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.059]  Looks like Iran just tested one.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.940]  Starting to figure out where we're going here.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.039]  South Korea wants nukes.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.539]  North Korea's threatening to attack.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.360]  And people are like, well, they've been doing that for a long time.
[00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:47.679]  But the escalations have never gotten anywhere near this, and you don't have the West financial bubble beyond collapse.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.019]  The Chinese are in total collapse, even worse than the West.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.080]  That's not even disputed.
[00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:57.759]  This is when big wars start because that keeps the regimes in power.
[00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:04.259]  You'd think you could throw regimes out during wars, but historically that actually props up the regime.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:24.150]  So why would the Biden, Harris, Obama, whoever's running things up there, deep state, legitimately, because it's come out in cables and it's been leaked over the years and we know that John Kerry was working on With Iran as a shadow ambassador when Trump was in office as president trying to derail Trump cutting off Iran.
[00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:36.170]  A large arm of the globalist system really thinks that a total war with Iran will get out of hand and that they've got enough sleeper cells in the West to actually bring things to a standstill.
[00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:43.390]  They'll also block those major canals where half the oil in the world goes through.
[00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:48.910]  And so there's a large camp that doesn't want full war with Iran.
[00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:57.069]  And then there's another camp in the U.S. and Europe and, of course, Netanyahu that does want it and thinks they can defeat Iran.
[00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:04.329]  And you notice the last few months, Israel's really destroyed the forces and proxies in four different countries around Israel.
[00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:09.519]  And they've taken out the leaders of all those groups.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.640]  And so Iran's tentacles have been cut off.
[00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:14.920]  And that has emboldened Netanyahu.
[00:18:16.259 --> 00:18:18.140]  And so, you can read the documents.
[00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:19.160]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:19.980]  They're all over the news.
[00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:28.000]  That Israel is telling the Pentagon they're planning to hit before the election in the next 15 days.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:33.960]  So I believe the Biden administration, the people running it, did leak this information.
[00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.000]  They're confirming it's real.
[00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:37.619]  See if it was real, and then they denied it.
[00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:38.940]  That means they didn't want it out.
[00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:40.920]  But they're, of course, famous leakers.
[00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.799]  Now, here's another piece of why this is happening.
[00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:45.049]  You can look these numbers up.
[00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.410]  Kirk Elliott is going to go over this with us coming up in the next hour and all the other big economic developments.
[00:18:48.509 --> 00:18:49.829]  They're some of the most intense ever.
[00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.549]  Update.
[00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:51.910]  Collapse is coming.
[00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:58.130]  Unrealized losses at U.S. banks are seven times at least higher than during the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:04.890]  If you look at the graphs there, that is what's currently happening since 2008.
[00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.849]  So the bailouts didn't do what they were supposed to.
[00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.529]  It made it worse.
[00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:23.180]  And that's why you have the FDIC last year in December at their final meeting, the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation, that, you know, what is a quarter million backs up each one of your bank accounts, saying, well, we got to get the public ready for bail-ins.
[00:19:23.259 --> 00:19:24.799]  They're coming sooner rather than later.
[00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:27.779]  But we don't want to tell the public.
[00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:29.259]  And they go, well, then why are we telling them on this?
[00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:30.220]  Oh, they won't notice.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.259]  Because they record it and then post it on their website.
[00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:48.940]  That means them nationalizing all your accounts, Your assets, your stocks, your bonds, pooling them, creating derivatives out of them, and then you don't own your stocks and bonds and money.
[00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:51.019]  It's pretty much already like that, but it makes it official.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.200]  Just like the property tax, you don't really own your house, you rent it.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.500]  And then they push it all into the new central bank digital currency tokenized money.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.220]  And they can decide where you can spend it.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.180]  It surveils everything you do.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:03.980]  They can devalue it.
[00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.140]  They can increase the value of it.
[00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.869]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.589]  U.S. banks' unrealized losses soared to seven times.
[00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.490]  That's even in the media, not just the graphs.
[00:20:14.269 --> 00:20:20.210]  Seven times higher than during the 2008 financial collapse.
[00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.930]  Meanwhile, gold breaks 2,700 barrier for first time on safe haven demand.
[00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:32.170]  A bunch of new articles on that and what's really happening in the economy coming up next hour.
[00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:33.970]  We're going to really go to the documents.
[00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:43.000]  I've got A huge, huge stack of news.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.099]  Hong Kong to bring in measures to boost gold trading.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:55.400]  Then I've got all the big banks in the U.S. I'm going to say all JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, all of them saying, oh my God, the consumers are about to all want it.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.480]  It's the new bull market.
[00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:06.000]  And that's why they, for the last few years, have been hoarding it and buying it as much as they can until They can't suppress it anymore.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.319]  Then they say, go to town.
[00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.700]  Yeah, ABC News, gold prices hitting all-time highs.
[00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:13.019]  That's what I've been telling you.
[00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:22.220]  When the public finally figures it out, less than 2% of the population owns any gold as a commodity or as an asset, it is going to.
[00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:31.619]  And that all signifies they can't hold back The illusion that inflation isn't actually much worse than they say.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.859]  I mean, folks, I went yesterday to a barbecue place I've been going to for 25 years at least.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.460]  Gosh, no, wait, since high school.
[00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:40.259]  I mean, I'm getting old.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.259]  It's probably an older place, but I discovered it 32 years ago.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.259]  Still there, though they're not going to tear down the whole park, business park and build condos.
[00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:52.680]  They're moving and they don't know where.
[00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.779]  The point is, I go in there yesterday.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.339]  Because my seven-year-old daughter said, I want brisket.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.240]  And I said, sure, honey.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.640]  I'm never going to turn that down.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.720]  So I get in the car and drive over there.
[00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:18.259]  And I got, and I see this everywhere, but two pounds of brisket, two pounds of turkey, one pound of jalapeno sausage, and then like quarts, just four quarts aside.
[00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.000]  It's not that much.
[00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:21.039]  200 bucks.
[00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:30.299]  And I asked them, I said, I said, you know, like 10 years ago, this would have been like $70, $60.
[00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:30.920]  They said, yeah.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.119]  And I said, like a year ago, it was like $100.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.680]  They go, yeah, we held back prices, but we're going to go bankrupt.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.740]  It's just, it's all that expensive.
[00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:36.920]  I go, I know, I know.
[00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:40.200]  So like food, enough, because I wanted some leftovers.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]  We had it again today.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.539]  Enough food for like six people, $200?
[00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:47.279]  This is not some, you know, fancy pants place.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.279]  It's great food.
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.799]  But how do people pay for that?
[00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:59.980]  I mean, a McDonald's, Big Mac fries and large drink is $18 plus now.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:07.480]  And notice they held back, and I don't eat there, but I read at the news, and I've certainly driven by and seen the prices and saw it for myself.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.740]  So, that's insane.
[00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.380]  That's totally and completely insane.
[00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:19.660]  And they've been trying to hold back the public figuring it out.
[00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:27.980]  But it is absolutely way above 25% food increase costs since Biden got in.
[00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:29.619]  I mean, does anybody believe it's 25%?
[00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:32.200]  No one listening to me needs to be an economist.
[00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:34.779]  Has food gone up 25% in the last four years?
[00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:40.720]  No, it's gone up 50%?
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.119]  I mean, it is just bonkers.
[00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:46.359]  So...
[00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:49.440]  This whole old system is going down.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:57.599]  They need a crisis to get us to look at the backbed crisis, war, you name it, instead of the fact that the globalists are behind this garbage.
[00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:01.039]  But it's not good for them because people now know about the New World Order.
[00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.160]  I'm talking about it.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:02.819]  You're talking about it.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.099]  Elon Musk is all over the place.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.599]  So is Trump.
[00:24:05.059 --> 00:24:05.940]  You know, it's hot.
[00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.099]  People get it now.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.799]  And so, hmm.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.839]  They got a problem because they've already initiated financial collapse that I don't think can reverse.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.680]  That's what the economists are saying.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.900]  There's no way to reverse this.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.359]  There's different crash landings, different scenarios.
[00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:23.079]  But I'd like to be tomorrow's news today.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.140]  So we'll look forward next hour into all this.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.720]  But first, I want to come back with election news.
[00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.599]  Massive evidence of illegal aliens.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.099]  Not evidence.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:29.640]  It's all admitted.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.640]  Being allowed to vote.
[00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:32.380]  Not just in blue states.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.319]  In red states.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.660]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.160]  Stay with us.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:12.230]  All right, I want to plunge into the U.S. political news that obviously the whole world's paying close attention to here in a moment, but I just want to recap and say a few more things I didn't get to about the military Potential of war and expanded global conflict atmosphere and climate we're in.
[00:25:13.609 --> 00:25:19.589]  During the break, I was sitting here thinking about that I kind of dropped the ball the last 30 minutes.
[00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:26.009]  I mean, then I sat here and thought to myself, do I need to explain to people how serious it is, what's going on?
[00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.910]  Israel saying they're going to attack Iran before the election and the White House, I believe, leaked it.
[00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:32.730]  They admit it's real.
[00:25:34.489 --> 00:25:38.430]  Pentagon's documents and battle planning in coordination with the Israelis.
[00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:43.849]  You got North Korea blowing up its bridges and railways into South Korea saying they're prepared for total war.
[00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:51.369]  You got Xi Jinping yesterday announcing to the military in battle uniform for the first time ever, prepare for total war.
[00:25:51.569 --> 00:25:53.569]  And they all look completely crazed out of their minds.
[00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.230]  And our military is, you know, being led by a bunch of men in dresses.
[00:26:02.329 --> 00:26:11.400]  And then you've got Ukraine saying we want nuclear weapons and then build reports they're getting them in the next two weeks.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.779]  And then five weeks ago, Biden announces that the US has authorized NATO to start bombing inside Russia with heavy missiles.
[00:26:20.539 --> 00:26:22.640]  Cruise missiles that blow up, you know, whole blocks.
[00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:25.579]  This is all insane.
[00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:29.539]  And...
[00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:38.259]  If you go back to two years ago, Biden says we can't give F-16s and Abrams tanks because on the threat escalation ladder, that leads to World War III. Remember that clip?
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.140]  Should I play it again?
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.359]  You know what?
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.740]  I played it probably 100 times, probably 200 times.
[00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:44.299]  I'm going to play it again.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.859]  I'm going to play Harris last week saying Trump's going to use the military on citizens.
[00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:49.839]  I played it five times.
[00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:51.859]  She said it with no evidence.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.220]  Meanwhile, they've signed executive orders and the Pentagon responded with a giant battle plan.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:07.220]  For total martial law and the takeover of society, and the media finally covered it but focused on the killing U.S. citizens part, that's important, but that's like one finger on the whole body.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:15.259]  The document describes the Pentagon running America and troops taking over everything and then killing anybody that gets in their way.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.740]  So...
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:33.279]  Even though I knew the globalists were planning stuff like this decades ago, it's still hard for me to believe this is actually going on, but it is.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:46.380]  Just like the 325,000 children that the Senate report admits conservatively that they know of are missing that the government shipped in without IDs and handed over to God knows who.
[00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:52.279]  I mean, just all of this in and of itself is insane.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:28:12.339]  The crimes committed by Democrats and that Republicans, by and large, have stood by and accepted with some lip service are so crazy that imagine what we don't know about.
[00:28:13.339 --> 00:28:15.119]  So that's why I've said give it to God.
[00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:18.119]  Be politically engaged.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.539]  Pray.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.519]  Be the best person you can be.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.299]  Call for sanity.
[00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.640]  I mean, look at the footage I'm showing.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.519]  TV viewers can see this.
[00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.400]  This was put out three days ago by North Korea.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.920]  And Sky Television, that's the Fox News of the UK and Australia and all of it.
[00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:47.509]  Says that 1,500 units of special forces North Koreans, that means they get food, I guess.
[00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:55.369]  They keep the rest of the population under control by starvation, kind of like Klaus Schwab wants to do to all of us.
[00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.230]  You will eat the bugs and like it.
[00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.970]  You'll own nothing and love it.
[00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.390]  You'll own nothing and be happy.
[00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.029]  The future's not humans.
[00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.029]  We don't need people to polish their robots.
[00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:08.049]  These are real quotes.
[00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:18.730]  You look at the North Korean soldiers, which I've done research on it.
[00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:19.589]  It takes an hour to go over it.
[00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:24.809]  But yeah, there's North Korean troops in Ukraine and in Belarus.
[00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:37.230]  And then you've got the North Koreans running around doing displays of jumping and flipping and the classic karate moves where you put a cinder block on your stomach and somebody hits it with a sledgehammer.
[00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.910]  And that supposedly means you're really tough.
[00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:41.829]  That's a gimmick.
[00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.289]  Try actually hitting them in the stomach with a sledgehammer, not a cinder block.
[00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:52.269]  So, it's just, this is their crazy response to nuclear war.
[00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.549]  Now, these roundhouse kicks are good.
[00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:07.890]  So, we are rapidly sleepwalking, as I've said, into nuclear war.
[00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.789]  And I asked a question in a report I filed on X today.
[00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.910]  We can put it up on screen.
[00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:15.049]  It went up just about an hour ago before we went live on air.
[00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:24.950]  Dealing with China preparing for total war as Israel's plans to attack Iran before the election are leaked and confirmed by the Pentagon and the White House.
[00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:33.930]  Ukraine can have nuclear weapons within two weeks and North Korea is blowing up the bridges and railways into South Korea.
[00:30:35.809 --> 00:30:43.289]  I asked the question, you remember 1990, Desert Shield and Desert Storm 91 and the re-invasion 2003?
[00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:51.970]  I mean, there were tens of millions of people running around protesting those wars.
[00:30:54.230 --> 00:31:10.059]  And I didn't agree with the leftists that were protesting it, but I did agree with the protest happening because I knew Iraq was being set up and Had been told to invade Kuwait when they wouldn't pay him the money they owed him for oil.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.700]  They were stealing the slant drilling.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.079]  And the U.S. Ambassador, April Gillespie, told him to go ahead and invade on video with Saddam Hussein.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.480]  He'd been our ally and attacked Iran for seven years and lost to over a million people.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.400]  And not saying Saddam's a great guy, it's just that it was a setup.
[00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.220]  I knew the history of it.
[00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:26.099]  And in 2003, certainly...
[00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:31.720]  Iraq wasn't involved in 9-11 and they didn't have WMDs and all the rest of it.
[00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:36.519]  But going in and picking on Iraq is going to get U.S. troops killed.
[00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:37.640]  It's going to destroy the country more.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.839]  It's going to kill a bunch of innocent people.
[00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:46.660]  The sanctions alone under the Clintons that tripled what Herbert Walker put on them in the first war killed 2 million people, a million of them kids.
[00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:54.920]  When U.S. Ambassador and Secretary of State after that, Marilyn Arbat famously got asked, there was only a million dead, a million more died.
[00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:58.190]  There's a half million kids, you know, Good price to pay.
[00:31:58.309 --> 00:31:59.809]  It ended up being a million adults, a million kids.
[00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.910]  No medicine, no nothing into the country.
[00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.150]  She said, yeah, it's a good price to pay.
[00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.769]  We'd do it again.
[00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:08.309]  So those were evil wars.
[00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:09.170]  Those were wrong.
[00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.250]  And I don't know any soldiers that fought in those wars that I've met.
[00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:17.150]  Famous conservatives, famous Republicans, Navy SEALs, Delta Force, enlisted, you name it.
[00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.150]  They all say it was all a big lie and a fraud.
[00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.509]  But that couldn't lead to the end of the world.
[00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:36.390]  So as bad as that was, and I was against the first war when I was in high school and spoke out against it, and people thought I was a traitor.
[00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:44.430]  They had rallies in the gym here in Austin, Texas at Anderson High.
[00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:50.509]  The principal was an Army National Guard general.
[00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:54.950]  They had helicopters landing in the football field and all the rest of it.
[00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.549]  Everybody was so excited.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.880]  And I was informed, so I said it was a fraud.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.720]  And then again in 2003, so see, I'm not for the Muslims invading and taking over.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.799]  That's the left that destroyed their countries and brought them here.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.700]  That's the globalist.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.920]  And of course, it was all based on lies that Saddam threw babies out of incubators and stomped their brains out.
[00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:21.480]  Turned out that was a CIA PR firm, the girl that testified, never been to Kuwait.
[00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:22.400]  None of it was true.
[00:33:25.159 --> 00:33:28.579]  But again, that's bad enough.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.680]  But Iraq didn't have ICBMs and submarines off our coast.
[00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:45.180]  Iraq, them too, didn't have a billion and a half people like China.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.839]  And back then, there weren't nuclear weapons in the Middle East except in Israel.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:34:04.089]  Now, nuclear weapons are In Saudi Arabia, in Iran, we've been getting told since 2001 that Iran's two weeks away from nuclear weapons.
[00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.269]  No, they've had them.
[00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:10.130]  And I've told you that for 15 years, and now it's mainstream news.
[00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:11.909]  Now they're saying they're testing them.
[00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:28.670]  So, if Israel bombs Tehran, their capital, and bombs the military bases of the Persians, Will Iran respond back with more than just a firework show of missiles they know that the Iron Dome will shoot down?
[00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:45.730]  Or even if Iran doesn't respond back, will the West provide false flags to blame Iran in Europe, in the United States, and say it's the Hezbollah sleeper cells that they have let in,
[00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.210]  by the way?
[00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:52.519]  But claim it's them and even roll up some of them as a pretext for full war with Iran.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.079]  Will they shoot down Trump's aircraft with a surface-to-air missile?
[00:34:58.659 --> 00:35:00.440]  The deep state and blame Iran.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.599]  I told you that before they started saying that Iran would.
[00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:06.659]  Because that's a clear next move.
[00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:09.159]  So...
[00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:13.320]  I would pray if I was you and I would also...
[00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:16.989]  Call the talk radio.
[00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.969]  Call Congress.
[00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.630]  Go to the city council.
[00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:22.349]  Anywhere you can speak and be heard.
[00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:25.570]  Those clips of city councils go viral even if you're in a small town.
[00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.929]  You can talk about anything you want at those things.
[00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:35.650]  Just at Citizens Communications and bring this up and say, you don't want World War III. Or go to Citizens Communications and pull up the document.
[00:35:35.789 --> 00:35:36.449]  It's everywhere.
[00:35:36.889 --> 00:35:38.829]  Trend to the top of X. Two days this week.
[00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.110]  The DOD document for total martial law and killing U.S. citizens.
[00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:44.969]  Bring that up.
[00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:50.630]  I mean, let the system know that you're aware of it because I get this doesn't sound normal.
[00:35:50.750 --> 00:36:00.269]  It doesn't even sound plausible to go speak at your legislature or wherever you can and say, hey, there's 325,000 missing kids, many in slave labor and sex slavery.
[00:36:00.489 --> 00:36:07.389]  We as a state need to do something because the feds won't because Mayorkas and Obama and Biden and Harris are running it.
[00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:10.929]  That sounds crazy to say that, but you have the Senate report.
[00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:26.800]  You see, There's a blind spot we all have when something is so evil, so bad, so out of control, so disgusting, that it's hard to even talk about it because it sounds so unbelievable.
[00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:30.440]  And the perfect example of that is what you've seen the last...
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:42.400]  Really six, seven years, but building up the last few, where through BlackRock funding and Democrat Party funding, all over all 50 states, it's happening in Europe too, same plan, happening in Australia.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.360]  They have drag queen story time everywhere, pedophile story time.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.800]  Fat man in a dress, kid bounce on their lap.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.000]  Grooming time.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:37:05.079]  That they put in elementary and middle school and high school, hardcore pornographic books that show graphics of children having sex with each other and adults, and talk about it and how great it is.
[00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:09.400]  I mean, they're literally handing out pedophile publications to kids.
[00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:13.280]  And then we've gone down to the local libraries, school libraries.
[00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:18.159]  I mean, crew we have, like Christy Lee, where she had kids in middle school.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.460]  She's prolific.
[00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:21.960]  Great lady.
[00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.059]  She's pregnant again with her husband.
[00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:23.719]  I'm jealous.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.119]  Six kids, seven kids now.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.300]  And she brings back the book.
[00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:31.639]  And it's one of the famous pedo ones with graphics of kids having sex with adults.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.840]  And I'm like, I became very upset looking at it.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.099]  And I wouldn't even show it on air.
[00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:41.079]  And then, here in Austin, our crew goes down.
[00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.809]  They try to read it at the school board, and the police come and threaten to arrest him.
[00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:51.190]  They say, you can't read that on TV. Oh, but you can give it to an 11-year-old.
[00:37:53.150 --> 00:38:05.809]  So that's an example of this stuff sounds so horrible and so unbelievable, and it's so bad you can't even read it at city council or a school board, but it's going on.
[00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:08.289]  So I get it.
[00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:14.030]  Evil gives you problems so bad, and it's moving on every front, that people just feel overwhelmed.
[00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:24.369]  Let me tell you, you can't just hide in your house, or hide in your church, because most churches are just holes where ostriches stick their heads, and hope all this goes away.
[00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.070]  It's not going to go away.
[00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:35.179]  Because the old financial system is coming to a close, the globalists have put into function Plans that really can't be reversed.
[00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:39.460]  And I've not just talked to Kirk Elliott, who's a great economist and called it and very smart.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.500]  I don't have guest on unless they've got a very good track record of accuracy.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.079]  You've got to be above 95 or I don't talk to you.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.739]  But even mainline economists across the world say there's no fixing this.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.440]  If they do quantitative easing, that causes hyperinflation.
[00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:58.920]  If they contract the economy, there'll still be inflation.
[00:38:59.059 --> 00:38:59.960]  You'll have stag inflation.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.199]  Which they say, and I agree, is about the worst thing you can have.
[00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:08.539]  But people are coming up for air.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:24.260]  All over the world, including in Italy, the government just banned taking citizens' children with their CPS and then giving it to lesbian and homosexual couples.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.360]  And they're calling it harvesting of children and the theft of children.
[00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:31.800]  Russia manned it 15, 16 years ago, as you know.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.079]  And now it's mainstream news all over the world.
[00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:35.579]  It's happening.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.739]  So they tried to pass a law that the government could say that they are your guardian.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.019]  And then the government kills you with euthanasia.
[00:39:43.139 --> 00:39:45.440]  That got shot down in Canada.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:51.500]  So as negative as all this is, there's still some bottom, some point.
[00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:54.460]  But it's only because people said no.
[00:39:56.099 --> 00:40:03.800]  And that's all I'm saying is, all I know is stuff's going to get a lot worse until we learn to say not just no, but hell no.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.739]  Or as Tony Montana would say, F no.
[00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:11.000]  Not just no, F no.
[00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:18.559]  I mean, again, Thomas Jefferson was asked at this point Friday in a newspaper interview, what level will tyrants take us?
[00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:19.480]  What's the limit of tyranny?
[00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:20.420]  So whatever you put up with.
[00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:22.409]  And the newspaper reporter said, why?
[00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.969]  And they said, because one group of tyrants will be replaced by some that are worse, and then worse and worse.
[00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:33.349]  When you create a vacuum, I'm paraphrasing him, you create a climate where you race to the bottom.
[00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.489]  And that's what we're under.
[00:40:37.809 --> 00:40:41.610]  So the evil gets more reckless, more insane, more out of control.
[00:40:42.789 --> 00:40:47.289]  That's basic criminology, because there's no gravity holding it down.
[00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:52.269]  I've got a proposition for you that I think makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:52.909 --> 00:41:03.889]  Get great t-shirts that promote Americana and freedom and a message of anti-globalist tyranny, while at the same time keeping my broadcast on the air one way or another.
[00:41:04.289 --> 00:41:09.610]  Coming up on the 13th of November, 26 days as I've been taping this, we can easily be shut down.
[00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:16.289]  But regardless, we still have something of a First Amendment left, and if you back us, I will continue on the air.
[00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:17.469]  In fact, I will expand.
[00:41:17.969 --> 00:41:21.710]  But right now we need more funds just to continue on if we get shut down.
