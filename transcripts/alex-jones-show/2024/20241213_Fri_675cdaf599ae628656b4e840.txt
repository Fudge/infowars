[00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.710]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.509]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.200]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.399]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.060]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.099]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.780]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.140]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.780]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:27.620]  We're AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:39.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow humans here on this incredible planet hurtling through this spectacular universe full of consciousness.
[00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.959]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:42.379 --> 00:02:00.459]  It is Friday, December 13th, 2024. We are 37 days, 23 hours, 58 minutes, 16 seconds, until President Donald John Trump, three-time winner of the presidential election,
[00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.120]  stolen from him and the people in 2020, returns.
[00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:19.090]  Victoriously from exile to the White House of the greatest country on earth as we begin the journey to restore our republic and destroy the globalists.
[00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:35.569]  Well, I've had some very interesting conversations in the last 24 hours, a lot of intel, a lot of huge developments going on behind the scenes that I am not at liberty to get to quite yet,
[00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.689]  but I may be able to this afternoon.
[00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:48.210]  So I'm like a hen sitting on eggs that I can feel moving beneath me as the little chicks begin to peck, peck, peck with their egg tooths out of the shell.
[00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.110]  But that will have to wait, my friends, because a watched pot never boils.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:17.280]  I was going to bed last night at about midnight and I do this maybe a couple times a month but I sent a note to myself and I also wrote on the bedside table Ask the question tomorrow,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.740]  why has Elon Musk, because I went and looked it up when I was thinking about this.
[00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.900]  It's been about 30 minutes looking for statements.
[00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.960]  Why has Elon Musk said zero?
[00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.159]  He says something about everything else.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.979]  I agree with about 99% of what he says.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.599]  Why has Elon Musk said zero about the UAV system?
[00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.650]  Revolution.
[00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.349]  The UFO invasion.
[00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.370]  And that's what it is.
[00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:50.969]  Why has he said nothing?
[00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:57.969]  And I laid there in bed for 30 minutes saying, yeah, I'm going to have the show headline tomorrow.
[00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:10.389]  B. Why has Elon Musk been completely silent and said zero about this phenomenon that has the attention of the world captured?
[00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.379]  And then I got up at 5.30 in the morning.
[00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:27.699]  First thing I did after I brushed my teeth, as I was sitting there at the coffee maker, was I went to X, and I went right to Elon Musk.
[00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:34.160]  And he just posted three hours before, at 2.30 in the morning.
[00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.579]  Unlike me, he doesn't sleep.
[00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.139]  And He responded.
[00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.139]  People said, oh, it's a joke.
[00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:43.459]  No, no, it's not.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.040]  I'll give you my opinion, which I know is not my opinion, because I know his views on things.
[00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.480]  I will decode this straight ahead and so much more today.
[00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.180]  Big broadcast.
[00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.339]  Share those links, Paul Revers.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:08.990]  We are coming to you live from Starbase, Texas, transmitting galaxy-wide We are, all those AM and FM stations,
[00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.490]  those satellites all bouncing off the planet, shooting into the heavens.
[00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:30.610]  All right, it is Friday, December 13th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, very blessed and honored to be here and to still be in the M4 studios by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin for the Democratic Party and the deep state trying to shut us down, but the federal judge shut that down.
[00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.949]  We've got some updates on that for you today.
[00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.089]  I've learned a lot more, but that's going to be a little corner of the broadcast that I'll get to at maybe five minutes at some point.
[00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.970]  Because you're not tuned in, really, to learn about that, are you?
[00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:53.250]  The big question is, what in the hell's going on over every major U.S. city on a weekly basis, sometimes a nightly basis?
[00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:57.790]  The worst of the phenomenon is over New Jersey.
[00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.129]  But it's happening over capitals around the world.
[00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:09.689]  I hear some footage shot in New Jersey just two days ago, and that's one of these crafts that doesn't have its lights on.
[00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.629]  Now, I have studied this for years.
[00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:18.389]  40 years.
[00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:26.110]  And I've interviewed all of the experts that I have researched that I believe are credible, like Greer and many others.
[00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.730]  We're coming back on very soon.
[00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.970]  And one of the best researchers, a dark journalist, will be joining us coming up about an hour and a half from now.
[00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:35.629]  For an hour and a half, he'll be with us.
[00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.509]  So that's coming up at 12.30 p.m.
[00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.769]  today.
[00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.389]  I have a very good idea what's going on.
[00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.949]  In fact, I know a lot of what's going on.
[00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:06.889]  And I can conclusively tell you that 99% of this is not other than human.
[00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:23.899]  That said, every ancient culture The ancient Chinese, the ancient folks in Mesopotamia, ancient Europeans, ancient Mesoamericans, ancient Africans, all have the same stories.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.500]  And all describe the same thing.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.500]  And if you look at it, it's right there in the Bible.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:41.220]  It's totally clear, and modern theologians try to do backflips and all sorts of gymnastics.
[00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.250]  And acrobatics to not focus on what is all over the Old Testament.
[00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.949]  And you read Ezekiel, I mean all of it, it's over and over again.
[00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:02.269]  Big giant ships land and humanoid creatures on floating platforms come out and say, get on your knees and put something in their mouth.
[00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.389]  And they take it, sweeten the mouth, bitter in the stomach, start...
[00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:15.089]  Being able to communicate with these things after they take it, which is obviously lifting the veil.
[00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.009]  And they've got all the big university studies they suppressed until about six years ago.
[00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:41.279]  I was the first to break this on Rogan before they started declassifying it, but they have equivalent to astronauts in Japan, in the US, in Europe, all over, but those are the first that came out where they study under DMT drips and other things, mapping The interdimensional gates,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:49.519]  when the veil is lifted, because your brain blocks it from your visual systems, there's a filter so you can operate.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.940]  If you're looking outside the third dimension, things would get a little bit distracting, wouldn't they?
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:04.179]  And they're having groups of these researchers are having the same hallucinations.
[00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:05.539]  They're not hallucinations.
[00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:15.480]  And are communicating, in many of the cases, with the same beings at the same time.
[00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:22.259]  Now, there's no such thing as a group hallucination, obviously, because it's not a hallucination.
[00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:27.179]  And people don't need to be on DMT now to see what's flying around.
[00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:31.340]  And it's the exact stuff that people drew 3,000 years ago in India.
[00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.809]  And 3,000 years ago in Egypt.
[00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.009]  And 3,000 years ago in China.
[00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:41.269]  And there's cave paintings in Europe of people standing on a hill.
[00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.909]  And you see flying saucers.
[00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:46.950]  And there's all these Aztec temples they dig up.
[00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.269]  And there's flying saucers.
[00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:54.450]  And there's what looks just like 747s with engine wings and windows.
[00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.049]  There's rockets with fire shooting out the bottom.
[00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.909]  That look just like Starship, Elon Musk.
[00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.289]  So obviously, this is the big enchilada.
[00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:22.409]  And you've seen a giant long-term program in Hollywood and culture normalizing aliens.
[00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:29.350]  And all different sorts of aliens, like the Space Barn, Star Wars, or...
[00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.870]  Men in black, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.690]  It's fascinating.
[00:10:39.610 --> 00:11:04.490]  But if you look at what's in the Bible, in Genesis, the same story, and the Jews were writing that down 4,000 years ago, or longer, it's the same story Being told by the Aryans in what is Iran today,
[00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.049]  by the Babylonians, by all those cultures.
[00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:16.529]  And they're able to decipher the hieroglyphs in other ancient languages.
[00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:18.070]  And it's right there.
[00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.590]  It says these entities came from...
[00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.789]  They list what stars.
[00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:23.230]  The entities said they came from there.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.820]  And that they're here for a reason.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.059]  That they want to give us knowledge.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:43.820]  Now, that's in all of the ancient legends.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:12:01.820]  So, when you see a bunch of things that look and behave like what people wrote about and told us Thousands of years ago, and you look at medieval paintings at the Vatican, and medieval paintings that hang in Paris,
[00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:13.440]  and you pull these up, just medieval paintings that show UFOs, and these are documented paintings that have been written about for hundreds and hundreds of years that are hanging.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:31.279]  They weren't recently made in the last hundred years, and it'll show the star that led the wise men to Jesus, one of the famous ones, and it shows a perfect Gray flying saucer with portals flying above them in the manger.
[00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:48.159]  And you look at it and it's the exact thing people have been seeing recorded continually throughout history but really showing up in big numbers at the end of World War II. And the pilots reported this as well.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:13:03.179]  Yeah, you've got the knowledge of the Dogon tribe, what the aliens reportedly told them, and then you can't even see that star system where they say it is with a telescope, with a normal telescope, but now they can.
[00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.559]  And then the whole culture is about being visited yearly by these things.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:30.480]  But it's the Sumerians, and I've read a lot of books and checked it out for myself and confirmed it's in the Royal Museum in England, and it's in the German Museum, and it's in the Vatican.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:46.460]  Ancient idols that are humanoids with spacesuits on.
[00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:52.220]  And we can go over all that and show all that, and we'll do that when Dark Journalist comes on in about an hour and 20 minutes.
[00:13:55.799 --> 00:14:01.200]  So you can look at all this and say, oh, it's all human.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.419]  And then when I look at 99% of what you're seeing, I mean, I played this a bunch yesterday.
[00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:11.259]  We'll play it again, but it's a nice clear night a few nights ago in New Jersey.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:19.620]  Thousands of people posted the same video from different angles, and you can see the craft accelerate from the ground.
[00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:20.340]  You can see them.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:28.700]  You can hear what sounds like jet engines, and they all go up to about 10,000-15,000 feet and sit there and just hover.
[00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:36.169]  And then so many of the drones that have popped up that have been caught by the military and others in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places.
[00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.429]  You look at them and it looks human.
[00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.450]  It looks like a platform moving quick with a bunch of antennas and communication stuff hanging off of it.
[00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.110]  Probably got a turbine or turbines in it.
[00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.990]  It's just a normal big drone with a lot of equipment on it.
[00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.970]  So you look at this and we've got some real leads on things.
[00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:03.320]  There's a big air taxi company with a lot of big funding behind it that's based right there in New Jersey.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.779]  And I'm going to get to that a little bit later that has their promotional videos that act and behave like what you just saw that we just showed on screen from New Jersey.
[00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:19.120]  But here's the issue.
[00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:20.039]  Why?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.779]  They still have to get FAA flight plans when they do all that.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.259]  So, why would they not get the FAA flight plan?
[00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:32.919]  Why would they then do this?
[00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:38.779]  And then why would the government not send up aircraft and order them to land and then expose it?
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.000]  Because my dad's a pilot.
[00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:45.179]  My uncle was a pilot, helicopter and aircraft.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.100]  And a lot of my friends are...
[00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.330]  And so I know the basic rules about how it works.
[00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.750]  And anybody can check this out.
[00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.549]  It's not my opinion.
[00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:59.250]  If you don't know about basic aviation, that...
[00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.370]  Let's say you're in a helicopter.
[00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:03.370]  And I've done this.
[00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.269]  You've seen us do it.
[00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.350]  It'll be on Crowder.
[00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.750]  And all the roads are closed.
[00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.929]  But I was still scheduled to be on it.
[00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.669]  So my buddy's got a helicopter.
[00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.870]  He follows a flight plan.
[00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.190]  Normally you have to do that, but if you're going into a big city, you do.
[00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.970]  You've been down to the border to cover it.
[00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:18.309]  You radio ahead.
[00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:18.769]  You let them know.
[00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.409]  They ask you questions.
[00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:20.149]  You tell them what you're doing.
[00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:25.090]  And they're talking to you when you're coming in.
[00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:31.370]  And if you just show up and don't talk to them and start flying into downtown Dallas, they'll say, hey, who are you?
[00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:32.049]  What are you doing?
[00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.330]  Identify yourself.
[00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:33.769]  Where are you going?
[00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.289]  Where are you coming from?
[00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.929]  And then if you don't start responding...
[00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:56.000]  And you start going anywhere near critical infrastructure, like a military base, which these are over, within usually just 10 minutes, there is a fighter jet flying right up for a visual, 50 feet away,
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.720]  looking to find out if you've had a heart attack or whatever's going on.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.559]  And then if they see you slumped over, the Cessna or the helicopter or whatever, they'll wait and if it gets near a...
[00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.730]  Crowded area, they might shoot you down.
[00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:20.329]  If not, they'll just wait, like the famous golfer, I forget his name, the jet depressurized, and they didn't shoot down, they followed it and waited until it crashed in a wooded, unpopulated area.
[00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:29.710]  But if you're over a military base flying around and doing maneuvers and you don't respond, it is the default to shoot you down.
[00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:40.140]  So, the critical nuclear weapons bases in the U.S. and Germany, Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of admitted events in the last year.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.880]  They're happening every couple days right now, where sometimes 15, 20, 30, 40 large craft.
[00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:53.240]  I mean, by large, they're not little drones, 10, 15, 20 foot long.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.359]  Show up and then hover around the nuclear weapons depots.
[00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:05.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you approach a nuclear weapons base...
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.519]  And you don't start identifying yourself when you pull up to it.
[00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:11.720]  They're going to pull guns out and point them at you.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.440]  And if you make any false moves, you're going to get filled full of bullets.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.380]  That's a fact.
[00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:18.299]  People get shot.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.539]  You see it in the news.
[00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.440]  On a routine basis.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.599]  That's not a normal military base.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.119]  You fly your helicopter...
[00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.990]  Or your Cessna over a controlled airspace and it's on the maps and now they got computers and all the planes it tells you.
[00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:47.049]  They will instantly start saying what are you doing?
[00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.890]  When you don't respond they're going to start threatening that you're going to be arrested.
[00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:51.910]  Then you're going to have aircraft around you.
[00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.569]  And if it looks like you got weapons or something they're going to shoot you down.
[00:18:55.829 --> 00:19:00.450]  If not they're going to follow you back to where you went and there's going to be police waiting to put you in handcuffs.
[00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.910]  I know for most of the audience you know all of this, but for the general public it doesn't.
[00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.049]  Because they keep wondering, why does it the FBI? Why does it the governor?
[00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.890]  Why does it the military?
[00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.430]  And then the military, the Pentagon.
[00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.710]  No, we don't know what it is.
[00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:17.829]  When Kirby says that, obviously he's not been read into it, but he's high level.
[00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.910]  He's lying to you.
[00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:29.910]  And these drones, most of these drones are very slow, meaning they're turbine driven.
[00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.809]  They're hovering.
[00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:37.430]  And so these things slowly fly over, hang out over bases, then leave.
[00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:51.309]  If the military didn't know what those were, or wasn't ordered to stand down, because the pilots don't know, I believe them when they say they're not being told, they would be swarmed by helicopters and aircraft in minutes and followed back.
[00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:59.009]  And the police would be there, and the military police that was near a base would be there with automatic weapons pointed at you.
[00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:00.069]  Okay?
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:09.720]  You go fly over a nuke base, you're probably going to get shot down if you hang around, and you're guaranteed going to be arrested.
[00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:21.059]  So, it is not my opinion when I tell you this is absolute bullshit.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.160]  When you're told by the Pentagon, they don't know what this is.
[00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:45.720]  Now, they got caught in their lies yesterday because they started hyping the feds and the governors and the local non-secret government constabulary that we think it's an Iranian mothership off the coast and they're going to get us and we need to blow them up.
[00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:49.079]  And the Pentagon within an hour said, no, no, no, no, no, don't shoot at them.
[00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:50.980]  It's not Iran.
[00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.750]  And it's not us.
[00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.490]  We don't know who it is.
[00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.970]  Now, we've got hundreds of these videos.
[00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.730]  I sent the crew like 50-something yesterday, 50-something, hundreds in highs.
[00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.849]  I sent them a whole bunch earlier in the week.
[00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:07.269]  It's ridiculous.
[00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.930]  We'll play a lot of them coming up with audio.
[00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:15.430]  But the point is, in almost all cases, when they even fly over low, you can hear the...
[00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.250]  You can hear that they're turbines.
[00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.650]  Okay?
[00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.970]  And some look like Ezekiel's wheel that's in the Bible and it's got these wheels going.
[00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:31.490]  And the way that's behaving, I mean, it's Hollywood stuff.
[00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:39.170]  You can just look at it, tell how it's operating, tell it's man-made lights, the way they turn the lights on and turn the lights off.
[00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:46.450]  They're out there, most of them are unmanned, to get a scare going.
[00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.430]  So we know there's a Pentagon stand down.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.940]  Almost all of them are clearly human-made.
[00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:01.079]  I mean, that looks like an Imperial probe droid right there.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.960]  That's basically what they are.
[00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:08.200]  I mean, that's a turbine system in the middle, but it's got a bunch of antennas and sensors and stuff on it.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:15.980]  Now, that said, I've seen radar scopes as early as the 60s right through to now.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.140]  I've seen the NASA footage.
[00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:17.880]  It's all confirmed.
[00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:30.819]  The Apollo programming followed by craft that would shoot off at, in space, you know, Mach 100 plus, you know, tens of thousands of miles an hour just instantly.
[00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:35.859]  And it's the acceleration that, you know, at that time it clearly couldn't be human.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.500]  And it's just speeding off instantly.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:46.299]  It doesn't go 10, 20, 40,000 miles an hour like any propulsion we've had where it starts speeding up.
[00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:52.579]  It just, in one second, goes 30,000 miles an hour, 100,000 miles an hour, it's just gone.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.259]  It goes to zero to 20,000 miles an hour instantly.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.039]  It looks like it disappears, but they slow down the footage and it's gone.
[00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:10.539]  And they turn at perfect angles.
[00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:12.359]  90 degrees, just...
[00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:30.410]  So, and that's what's described by the ancients, and that's what's described by people in the 1700s, in the 1800s, the 1900s, before the Wright brothers or any of it, all we had was hot air balloons before that.
[00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.630]  The Italians and French and the Chinese, you know, everybody argues who's invented it.
[00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.750]  It's the Chinese had large hot air balloons.
[00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.089]  They just didn't do it a lot.
[00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:41.609]  It's like they quote invented gunpowder.
[00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.730]  People invented it as well.
[00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:43.769]  They just mass produced it.
[00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:44.630]  But no one knows.
[00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:46.809]  It's like asking where was pasta invented.
[00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.890]  You try to look it up and they go, well, everybody argues.
[00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:50.309]  Every culture basically has it.
[00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:57.430]  So, most of this is human.
[00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:00.769]  But there is stuff going on.
[00:24:00.869 --> 00:24:03.450]  And I found a bunch of the classic footage that I'd seen before.
[00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:05.809]  People are out fishing on a boat.
[00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.230]  And here come a whole bunch of white lights that are so bright.
[00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:12.210]  In the middle of the day, they're blaring white.
[00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.809]  And then people are like, ah!
[00:24:14.089 --> 00:24:15.490]  And then all of a sudden they go, bzzz, and they're gone.
[00:24:16.069 --> 00:24:18.269]  From like the 1970s, 80s, and 90s.
[00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:26.190]  People out for a picnic, and they've got an 8mm camera in the middle of nowhere in New York.
[00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.130]  And all of a sudden, here comes a craft ride up, and then it goes, bzzz, it's gone.
[00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.750]  That stuff's not coming from people.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:49.920]  Unless Atlantis never really went away, if it existed, and the ancients said it did, and everything Plato said pretty much, people for thousands of years didn't know he was accurate.
[00:24:50.559 --> 00:25:06.779]  2,200 years ago or so when he was writing his different books, the top philosopher that kind of created the ideas and the genesis of what Western culture is today, But he was also a depopulationist, and that's why the globalists are like that.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.839]  So that comes from him.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.619]  At least he popularized it in the modern Western sphere.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.220]  He talked about Atlantis like it was an absolutely real thing.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:25.859]  That 12,000 years before or so was out in the Atlantic Ocean and had this energy source and it blew up and the island sunk.
[00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:33.950]  And then he would also say, this is where this famous place was, or that famous place was that one ever found, and finally they find these cities and things.
[00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:35.250]  It's exactly where he said.
[00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.250]  So, just like people said, oh, the Bible's not right about this or that, then they find it.
[00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.450]  Oh, there was nothing by the Dead Sea.
[00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:48.289]  Oh, Sodom and Gomorrah didn't get destroyed, and then they go under it and find a sunken city.
[00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:49.509]  Wow, it's...
[00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:53.769]  So, he said it was real.
[00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:58.210]  They had flying machines, ontomans, big, big machines like humans.
[00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:04.269]  Like Megatron.
[00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:10.230]  So, it's not so much that we're theorizing about all this science fiction.
[00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:13.250]  It's that we've been there before.
[00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.230]  I mean, it's in our cells, our instincts.
[00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.430]  Like, this seems like home.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.000]  So, is what you're seeing now really the secret advanced human civilization that's been here the whole time?
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.880]  And why would they then keep that secret?
[00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.289]  The point is something big is about to be announced.
[00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:43.589]  Ladies and gentlemen, because of your support in the last 30 years, my operation has successfully devastated the globalists.
[00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:55.930]  The enemies of freedom worldwide openly give us the credit for being the genesis point for the mass global awakening to the new world order that is happening right now.
[00:26:56.309 --> 00:27:02.440]  So ladies and gentlemen, as we go into Christmas 2024, And the globalists are fighting as hard as they can to shut us down.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:10.140]  I want to thank you for your past support and I want to encourage you now to support the broadcast while getting great products because we're winning.
[00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:12.720]  We're turning the tide and I don't want to give up.
[00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:13.799]  I don't want to back down.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.619]  I know my most important work and my crew's most important work is still to come.
[00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:21.859]  The people of the planet are waking up.
[00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:24.059]  Now they're really ready to hear the truth.
[00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:26.259]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:41.670]  I want you all to have a fabulous Christmas coming up, and I want to encourage all of you to really think about what's happening around the world and ask yourselves, do we want to keep Alex Jones on the air, and do we want to get great products that enrich and empower our lives at the same time?

[00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:08.509]  Who fights, fights, fights.
[00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:16.670]  All of these products, Patriot Gear and so much more are exclusively available at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.890]  I want to thank you all for your past support.

[00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:28.990]  But now is the critical part of the fight and we need your support.
[00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.309]  Plus these are great products.
[00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:33.849]  Please go to TheAlexJonesStore.com and keep us on the air.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:50.720]  So last night when I went to bed, about midnight, I actually wrote a note on my bedside table so I wouldn't forget when I got up this morning and put my car keys on top of the note to make sure I didn't forget because I tend to forget stuff that I'm going to do when I go to bed.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:29:15.049]  To have the show headline today be basically, why is Elon Musk, an expert on space and aeronautics, Completely silent about the UAV slash UFO invasion.
[00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:24.769]  I mean, this is an order of thousands of times bigger than anything we've seen the last 80 years of this phenomenon.
[00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.390]  I mean, it's just all over the place.
[00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.309]  I mean, I see it all the time.
[00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.869]  Like, well, that's not a normal aircraft.
[00:29:35.099 --> 00:29:40.799]  A friend sent me a video we've got on the list of Austin a couple nights ago, and it's drones flying around spraying something.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.380]  It's not a condensation trail.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.180]  It's not ice crystals.
[00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:51.880]  So there's a whole bunch of different projects and groups and governments and corporations.
[00:29:52.599 --> 00:30:04.220]  And just like with the UAV issue, you've got Dubai and a bunch of other Middle Eastern countries and China admitting they're using antennas on the ground to ionize nuclei in the atmosphere.
[00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:16.210]  To form water droplets around the charged particles that then form clouds, that then form larger droplets, that forms rain.
[00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:19.849]  And they have weather control bureaus in a bunch of countries.
[00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:25.789]  But here they just treat us like we're ignorant savages and say that doesn't exist.
[00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.710]  Well, what's this treaty?
[00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:27.490]  Well, what's this group?
[00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.890]  Well, what's this government funding?
[00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:31.170]  And they go, well, chem drills don't exist.
[00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.250]  Well, that's not a technical term.
[00:30:32.369 --> 00:30:33.369]  So yeah, that doesn't exist.
[00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:38.029]  But your high-altitude aerosol weather control geoengineering project does.
[00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.730]  And here's Bill Gates spending billions a year with the Department of Energy to do it.
[00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.809]  A test to block out the sun.
[00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:48.710]  And they've done satellite tests with arrays to test it.
[00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:50.390]  I mean, he goes on and on.
[00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.509]  It's like when I would talk about, well, they're having a global government summit 15 years ago.
[00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:56.490]  People go, there's no such thing.
[00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:58.009]  They have New York Times articles.
[00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.029]  Jones is crazy.
[00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.589]  Claims there's a thing called globalists.
[00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.750]  There's a thing called Bilderberg.
[00:31:02.369 --> 00:31:10.549]  And then meanwhile, they were having conferences at the WEF decades ago, the Global Governance Policy Forum.
[00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:16.130]  They had another one last year that Elon Musk was at and told them that their tyranny was coming down.
[00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:19.369]  So it's on the internet.
[00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:20.349]  Millions are watching.
[00:31:20.609 --> 00:31:31.890]  The world leaders are there talking about their global government and cashless society and how they're going to cut the carbon and make you live in your house most of the time and your cell phone will tell you when you can leave and robots will take over everything and the future's not human.
[00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:40.869]  And I'm like, wow, they're planning this horrible anti-human future and it's on television, but separately it doesn't exist.
[00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.549]  It's like human-animal...
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.000]  Cloning and human animals splicing chimerics.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:57.480]  Decades ago, they had salmon that grow twice as fast and are twice as large that are part insect.
[00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.460]  They put insect genes in them.
[00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:03.220]  There's another salmon that has celery genes in it.
[00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:09.359]  They just randomly gene at it and splice stuff and see what happens with the eggs that produce the fish.
[00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.710]  The embryos, and then they go, well, this one really works.
[00:32:14.069 --> 00:32:16.430]  But they're really mean and kill all the other salmon.
[00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.670]  But don't worry, they won't get in the ocean.
[00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.069]  And then 10 years ago, oh, they've escaped.
[00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.789]  Because they put fences up in the ocean and say, well, they're in here.
[00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:27.490]  They won't get out.
[00:32:27.609 --> 00:32:28.009]  Yeah, right.
[00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.529]  Then they get out and start replacing the normal salmon.
[00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.069]  I mean, that's just one example of, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:32:34.309 --> 00:32:41.000]  We're not in the year 2024. We're in the year 2080. Just pick a number.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.279]  Depending on the technology, it's way advanced in what you know.
[00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.740]  The future's here.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.339]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:49.700]  So...
[00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:56.380]  We have giant weather control, terra-farming, geoengineering projects, corporate, governmental going on.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.559]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:13.460]  The outgoing CIA director, nine years ago, got up and did a whole two-hour press conference on, yeah, we can control the weather, but we don't want the public to know, because they'll get upset and they'll file lawsuits, plus other governments will, you know, get on our ass about it, but it's very promising.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.859]  And you're like, but you're on C-SPAN at the CFR saying that.
[00:33:18.339 --> 00:33:25.279]  Well, they know that a small enough number will watch that, and they'll say, oh, that doesn't exist, while they announce it exists.
[00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:34.140]  So, there's a psychological process to that, and that would take hours to get into it, but it's beyond gaslighting.
[00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:36.940]  It's crime stop.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.700]  It's doublethink that's in 1984, where you know two men can't have a baby.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.079]  You know there's X and Y chromosomes.
[00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:46.140]  I mean, these professors of biology know that.
[00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:52.039]  They just get promoted, like Niels de Grasse Tyson, if they just keep saying a woman is as strong as a man, pound for pound.
[00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:54.940]  That's an absolute lie on its face.
[00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:57.019]  Totally studied in real science.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:04.019]  But they're in the science of mind control and have authority figures telling you there's no weather control.
[00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:12.530]  There's no X and Y chromosomes, as Bill Nye and them have been running around saying.
[00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.530]  You're like, that is really insulting.
[00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:20.130]  But it's training the public to accept nonsense and just making everything a joke.
[00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.389]  It's jamming real discussion.
[00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:27.409]  It's poisoning pooping in the punch bowl.
[00:34:29.809 --> 00:34:35.489]  And then you reward the general public in the whole social credit score system that's already here.
[00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:43.090]  With monetary success, if they go against their own interest and believe a lie.
[00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:59.949]  So, Crimestop or Doublethink is, you know, for the last year and a half, Big Brother, the head of the Communist Party of the UK, in that fictional book, before he died, he said, was his projection of what England would be like, and by 1984, if it continued on the path it was on,
[00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:07.070]  and he would know he was the number one propagandist for the British government in World War II at the BBC, creating the propaganda.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.980]  And then he found out about their real plan to not beat Hitler, but just get him out of the way to make something even worse.
[00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:17.460]  He wrote about this before he died, non-fiction.
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:18.460]  Look it up, his essays.
[00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:28.559]  Died real quick of that real fast overnight tuberculosis when he kept shooting his mouth off and saying, no, no, this is real, and started giving interviews and saying, no, no, I was the...
[00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:29.900]  And it's on record he was.
[00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:38.079]  I mean, he was the boss of brainwashing for the British government.
[00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:46.059]  I mean, he was in the top board meetings when you'd have literally a few dozen top globalists around a big round table.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.039]  And then they would go to him as the director of the Ministry of Truth.
[00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:53.280]  So Winston Smith is him.
[00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:57.260]  But Winston is just mid-level in the book.
[00:35:58.119 --> 00:36:01.079]  Winston Smith is Eric Blair, the real name of George Orwell.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.199]  And he's there destroying the truth at the Ministry of Truth.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:17.239]  And then he actually knows Big Brother's bad, but he didn't know Big Brother wants to hurt everybody and actually slowly destroy humanity because it's so enjoyable for the upper party.
[00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:21.719]  That he thought he was in the inner party, but there was another inner party.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:33.099]  And so Orwell said, no, no, this is basically my composite allegory of what I've experienced and what they're going to do by 1984 if we don't stop them.
[00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:36.860]  It flipped 1948 when the book was published.
[00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:38.699]  That's from him.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.340]  That's how I know that.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.639]  You can actually go read his essays if you like.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:49.659]  I've read four or five big huge compendiums of his essays and articles that are more important than 1984. Got him on my bookshelf or in storage somewhere.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.659]  So down and out in Paris and London and just to kill an elephant.
[00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:59.199]  It goes on and on.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:36:59.900]  It's his whole life.
[00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:02.019]  But very interesting guy.
[00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:12.739]  What I'm getting at here is we're already in the breakaway civilization.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.480]  We are outside the real technology, the real government, the real system.
[00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:25.440]  And as it transfers our resources and technology that we develop to it, what does it do then?
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:35.300]  It pulls the rug out of the energy and the technology and the fertilizer and the food from us claiming carbon's bad, which we are.
[00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:56.219]  And it collapses the old system when it's done with it, which is now happening, and absorbs it all into itself in a new city-state global model where everyone else is poor, that's allowed to even live, and lives at a neo-feudal agrarian level.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:10.539]  And you'll have in every little town a small technology office where if you behave properly and do what they say, You'll be able to have a little bit of access to it as the outer party members.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:15.139]  Everybody else will have no access to it, be kept in total superstitious ignorance.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.300]  And then you'll have the main city-state command bases.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.199]  I mean, they wrote about this 100 years ago.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.159]  Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells, in their non-fiction political books.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.960]  They were Thabian Socialists.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.159]  Total elite controllers.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.619]  There are other members of their party.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:43.780]  There's footage, film footage of them in the 20s, 30s, and 40s when they first brought in audio saying, every year you'll be brought in and studied and tested by the party.
[00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:48.280]  And if you're not up to our standards, you will be executed.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.480]  And then this is Bertrand Russell and others.
[00:38:51.659 --> 00:38:56.920]  And these are the people the left praises as liberal and empowering people.
[00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:24.210]  But see, to sabotage the real human organic civilization, two men can have a baby, poison the water, the food, culturally poison people, fracture everybody, divide and conquer everybody, to weaken us as you transfer power into the city-states that you read about in Brave New World and Zardoz,
[00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:28.730]  And all the movies where they tell you what they're doing.
[00:39:29.449 --> 00:39:30.010]  Elysium.
[00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:36.469]  Hunger Games.
[00:39:38.329 --> 00:40:01.960]  And they say in their main line, CFR, Prilateral Commission, WEF plans, that they're going to get global control, collapse all the nation states, create neo-feudalism, and then pick command bases that Generally only one or two per region that will be the high-tech centers.
[00:40:02.659 --> 00:40:04.679]  And those themselves will be their own prisons.
[00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:08.300]  But where the people they choose are allowed to come into it.
[00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.579]  Everybody else has to pay huge amounts of money to get into it.
[00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:14.000]  So if most people can't even get into it, that will preclude you.
[00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:33.269]  And the places they're setting up are Kauai, Hawaii, Austin, Texas, obviously London, obviously Tel Aviv, Rome, Berlin,
[00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:41.110]  Brussels, but they have sub-bases also off the middle of nowhere.
[00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:48.309]  You'll be locked down for your entire life to just a few hundred square miles if you're lucky.
[00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:50.670]  That's the 15-minute cities.
[00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:52.070]  This is all official.
[00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.389]  And I've been reading about it for decades and decades.
[00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:59.829]  And imagine reading globalist books that are published and written by world leaders, but not for general consumption.
[00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:05.309]  And of course, I started reading this stuff when I was like 10. My parents had the same books.
[00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.730]  And I'm like, this is way better than the comic books I'm reading.
[00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:26.539]  And then as I got older, I went to the library and got more books and their statements, and I would see quotes in reports, books exposing them, and I would say, I want to see if David Rockefeller really said in 1976 in the New York Times, I want communism, Mao Zedong's the best,
[00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:30.320]  we need to take over America and collapse everything to rebuild the communist dream.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:36.440]  So I went and read the article on the micro fish, the micro film at the library.
[00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.670]  And a bunch of other, I mean, go the whole list.
[00:41:39.769 --> 00:41:42.230]  And the librarians at UT, they had the best one.
[00:41:42.789 --> 00:41:43.789]  When you go to UT, no.
[00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.150]  You're a 16-year-old?
[00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:47.469]  Well, what do you, you want this stuff?
[00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:48.389]  Well, let us help you.
[00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.869]  You know, we've got more stuff.
[00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.210]  Can you come back next week?
[00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.349]  It's called the stacks.
[00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.929]  And this is just a small part.
[00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.170]  We've got huge, huge warehouses.
[00:41:56.389 --> 00:41:57.289]  You want more?
[00:41:57.429 --> 00:41:59.650]  Yeah, well, sure, we'll bring that to you.
[00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.449]  We don't really ever see anybody want anything here.
[00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:06.489]  Everybody just goes against the cheat sheet books to act like that.
[00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:06.909]  I mean, literally.
[00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:21.989]  So, isn't it fascinating to learn about this whole breakaway civilization that's now very mature and advanced and is now collapsing everything else that you and I live in?
[00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:25.690]  Yeah, that's the article.
[00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.829]  So, back then, there was another one in 76. He wrote, too.
[00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:29.349]  There's two of them.
[00:42:29.469 --> 00:42:31.389]  But back then, you had to go to the library.
[00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:32.769]  I couldn't just punch that up at the New York Times.
[00:42:36.649 --> 00:42:38.570]  So, I think you're like me.
[00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:45.969]  Imagine, I'm, you know, 15, 16, 17, 18, just in between work and school and, you know, dating.
[00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:49.309]  It wasn't like I was just a bookworm, but I was staying up almost every night for hours.
[00:42:49.409 --> 00:43:03.440]  It's like it got more and more fascinating, and I'd say, surely this, you know, as a monthly subscriber to the New American Magazine, John Birchers, and I would just say, is it really true that this guy said this in front of the Senate?
[00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:07.019]  And then I would go actually get the book they wrote.
[00:43:11.099 --> 00:43:15.619]  And I'd read in a book or an article, like a Tex Myers article.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.460]  That a place in Bohemian Grove and they do juridic rituals and mock human sacrifices and all this.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:31.900]  And the West German Chancellor in his book, Men in Powers, political retrospective, said they do their own juridic rituals in Germany, but his favorite place to do them is there.
[00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:34.639]  And I went, you know, I'm going to go.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:43.559]  This is like right when I was going on there in like 94. I'm going to go and I'm going to go to the library and I'm going to see if I can get that Helmut Schmidt book.
[00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:47.679]  They didn't have Amazon back then, so you couldn't find it online.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.260]  The internet for general public was in its infancy, certainly after the government, around the 60s.
[00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:58.179]  And I went down to UT again.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.920]  They go, we don't have it, but we'll order it for you.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.260]  And the book came.
[00:44:03.039 --> 00:44:06.360]  And sure as hell, right there, he says, we do satanic rituals and we love them.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.800]  You know, druidic rituals, in his words.
[00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.039]  And I'm like, gosh, this is just incredible.
[00:44:11.239 --> 00:44:13.400]  It's just like, everything these patriots tell me is true.
[00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.110]  And there's footage of our folks got this just this year of it.
[00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.889]  I was up there already covering that when Trump got shot.
[00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.630]  Through a TV viewer you can see that.
[00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:26.429]  So, here's the footage I shot.
[00:44:27.929 --> 00:44:32.550]  So, this is what's going on here.
[00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.849]  So, why wouldn't you want to know about this?
[00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.869]  About the real civilization, the advanced civilization you're living right next door to.
[00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.130]  And I use this analogy a lot because it's the best.
[00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:44.949]  I go to a gym almost every day.
[00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:54.829]  That Rogan for 12 years got set up and tried to get me to go to.
[00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:55.909]  I knew he was co-owner.
[00:44:56.469 --> 00:44:58.110]  That wasn't publicly known until he sold it.
[00:44:58.969 --> 00:45:00.389]  And I finally go there.
[00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:00.809]  It's great.
[00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:03.170]  And people all the time, hey, you're friends with Joe Rogan.
[00:45:03.269 --> 00:45:03.690]  You know him, man?
[00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:06.969]  Hey, Trump was in town last week, stuff like that.
[00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.429]  You know, wonder where Joe's at.
[00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.250]  I hear he's around here sometimes.
[00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:13.150]  I'm like, oh, he's around here.
[00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:19.260]  And they don't even, obviously, might give them a secret, Because they just don't even know they're compartmentalized.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.679]  It's not even something really compartmentalized.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.400]  He's literally across the street.
[00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:31.159]  But see, that's a microcosm of compartmentalization.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.699]  And I know Joe Rogan's 100 yards away and actually there, and I can go over and have coffee with him.
[00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:38.579]  They don't know.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:45.099]  See, and that's what these National Security Acts and all of this is like, but a trillion times more intense.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:46:00.599]  They take your resources, your time, your energy, and your native intelligence, because even though this is an advanced reservation, they'll admit in their own leaked papers that most of the new stuff they're getting is still leaking out of the general public and the great innovations we come up with.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.320]  But now they think that AI is going to be way better than all this.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.679]  They're openly saying, if all know Harari, all of them, that they don't need us anymore.
[00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:11.119]  And they don't want us anymore.
[00:46:12.539 --> 00:46:16.179]  And they made the decision to get rid of us, and they're now hitting us with poison shots.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.500]  So, this is happening.
[00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:22.960]  This is going on.
[00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:28.059]  And there's all these people that pretend like they're in the power structure and pretend like they're serving the left and the globalist.
[00:46:28.159 --> 00:46:30.519]  You're following a self-destruct program.
[00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:32.260]  You think you're on the winning team.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.400]  You're a loser.
[00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:44.440]  You are a sub-cog in a death cult program that is turning what's left of humanity into scrap metal.
[00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:51.110]  The decision's been made to wipe almost all of us out, and then you don't even know any of this.
[00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.630]  You don't want to know how this works.
[00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:56.989]  You think it's smart to make fun of people that know a lot more than you.
[00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:06.329]  And you're literally aiding and abetting your own destruction and my own destruction.
[00:47:07.489 --> 00:47:11.650]  You didn't get offers to go meet Henry Kissinger and work for The Globalist.
[00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:13.989]  That's happened in front of John Harmon.
[00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.809]  That's the only case I'll talk about because they made it public.
[00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:17.530]  They didn't hide it.
[00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.989]  I have been offered at the time of the richest guy in the world starting $50 million a year to sell out.
[00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.110]  And they said, you're about to get sued.
[00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:28.969]  You're about to be shut down.
[00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.849]  This is seven years, eight years ago.
[00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:31.869]  It's eight years ago now.
[00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.730]  If you don't do this.
[00:47:33.889 --> 00:47:34.949]  And I said, I can't.
[00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:37.170]  And I said, you're making a big mistake.
[00:47:37.269 --> 00:47:38.230]  You guys are going to destroy yourselves.
[00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:39.269]  You'll never get away with this.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.840]  And now Elon Musk tells them that too.
[00:47:43.019 --> 00:47:45.659]  Because you're not going to get away with this.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:46.960]  People are going to figure it out.
[00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:53.400]  And I'm not going to sit here and decide it's okay to just wipe everybody else out.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.400]  And oh, I'm cool.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.519]  I've been let in on the club.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.880]  So to all of you serving the system, you're not in the club.
[00:48:02.639 --> 00:48:04.300]  If you know all this information...
[00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:10.389]  And then you get on board with them and you show you can understand it all and that you're in with it.
[00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:17.369]  Yeah, they'll kind of buy you off by claiming you're in their club, but you know they're going to get rid of you next phase as well.
[00:48:18.269 --> 00:48:28.110]  I mean, just from a Machiavellian position, this is dumb to make a deal with a bunch of psychotic killers that are so selfish they want to block off all this information from humanity and want to do this to their own species.
[00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:30.590]  So, to me...
[00:48:31.949 --> 00:48:33.530]  There's not even a debate.
[00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:37.690]  I've looked at every angle of this intellectually, historically, politically.
[00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:46.030]  Of course, my gut was right that I am abhorred by this, but I've analyzed it from their perspective, and it's a losing proposition for everybody.
[00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:58.610]  So our main job is exposing the breakaway civilization, what its aims are, what it's doing, how it's at war with the system that it's erasing, because it can be a challenging system to it.
[00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:59.110]  That's another thing.
[00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:10.309]  They want only one global government with a small, manageable population because they fear real renaissance and innovation, and so they want a total scientific dictatorship.
[00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:13.719]  So you can say, well, why do they want to kill us all?
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.019]  Well, they're selfish.
[00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:17.400]  They don't want competition.
[00:49:18.579 --> 00:49:22.440]  I would decentralize all this and be completely honest about it and let people decide what they want to do.
[00:49:22.619 --> 00:49:23.579]  You want to be cyborgs?
[00:49:23.639 --> 00:49:24.099]  You want to do this?
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.239]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:35.239]  But the Earth-based alliance or whatever you want to call it, And the people voting...
[00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:36.420]  And folks are going to...
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.780]  The majority are going to want stuff away from us.
[00:49:39.099 --> 00:49:39.559]  This is...
[00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:40.880]  I mean, you want to play around with any matter?
[00:49:41.099 --> 00:49:41.679]  You want to...
[00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:42.579]  You want to all merge the machines?
[00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:42.860]  Fine.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.500]  Go sign up.
[00:49:43.579 --> 00:49:44.360]  Go do it over there.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.179]  But you're going to be honest about...
[00:49:46.179 --> 00:49:46.800]  And then the automated...
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.780]  Well, they'll get more advanced.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.900]  Let's invade and take over.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.519]  I understand all that.
[00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:51.739]  I've already looked at every angle.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.480]  But that's why the decision has been made...
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.019]  To wipe out most of civilization...
[00:49:57.019 --> 00:49:58.960]  Have a highly controlled technology...
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.800]  Because you can't have...
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.619]  These breakaway civilizations...
[00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:05.570]  When there's more than one.
[00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:10.889]  And a lot of people are going, well, that makes sense then to kill everybody.
[00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.570]  Now, there's the argument right there.
[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:15.949]  And it just doesn't feel right at a cellular level.
[00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:19.829]  And I am in connection, and all of you are.
[00:50:19.949 --> 00:50:23.030]  You need to face that with the advanced intelligence.
[00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.630]  Electromagnetically, we all are.
[00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:28.690]  And God tells me, don't do this.
[00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:30.769]  So I'm going to go with God's plan.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.800]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.559]  I'll tell you more about Elon Musk's statement on the UFO invasion.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:41.860]  And more.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:48.000]  I got some really good news for you and great news for us to have the money we need to fight our legal battles and stay on air and hopefully expand.
[00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:49.059]  And thanks for all your support.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.300]  This baby was a sleeper.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.139]  I'm like, okay, the company we've got as a sponsor has a highly rated and I looked at it and checked the ratings.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.039]  Because this isn't private label.
[00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:02.699]  They went out to some folks and even souped up a top brand and made it even stronger.
[00:51:03.739 --> 00:51:05.059]  And I'm like, okay, great.
[00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:06.800]  It's a staple product.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.000]  It's a super green.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:14.579]  And I took it sometimes and stuff, but, you know, I've already got the greens I take that I was kind of addicted to.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.360]  But then I realized that I got more energy and more stuff out of this.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.099]  But I was so busy that I didn't come in and say, wow, this is the best thing I ever took, actually.
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.039]  I can't believe that our sponsor actually did something incredible.
[00:51:24.099 --> 00:51:26.780]  I've taken a lot of green, you know, drinks because they're superfoods.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.559]  Then Harris to Smith takes it.
[00:51:30.269 --> 00:51:32.269]  And says it's got the most energy you ever felt.
[00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.710]  And I'm like, wait, that's actually what happened with me too.
[00:51:34.809 --> 00:51:35.849]  Why haven't I said that?
[00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.050]  So you will not be disappointed.
[00:51:39.269 --> 00:51:41.329]  Optimal Human has been sold out for three months.
[00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:46.670]  They got a decent-sized shipment in, but it's going to sell fast and so popular, which is great.
[00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:47.449]  You're going to love it.
[00:51:48.809 --> 00:51:49.170]  And...
[00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:51.670]  It funds the operation to win-win.
[00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.849]  Give yourself the gift this Christmas of stamina, focus, clarity, energy.
[00:51:57.329 --> 00:52:00.269]  This is the best green superfood I've ever taken.
[00:52:00.869 --> 00:52:03.670]  It's got a bunch of concentrated herbs, too, that give you a real kick.
[00:52:04.769 --> 00:52:09.429]  And I was pissed off when I ran out of this a few weeks ago because I had a few kegs at home.
[00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.650]  I ran out of this, and I am really...
[00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.829]  People are asking how I'm losing so much weight.
[00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:16.090]  It's taking the sea moss, it's exercising, and it's...
[00:52:19.199 --> 00:52:20.679]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.189 --> 00:52:39.329]  Ultimate turmeric at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:52:39.429 --> 00:52:40.769]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:52:40.889 --> 00:52:41.289]  Stay with us.
[00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:43.269]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:45.389]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:49.369]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:52.230]  So, we need to stay on air.
[00:52:52.389 --> 00:52:53.849]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:52:53.989 --> 00:52:57.829]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:57.889 --> 00:53:02.869]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.829]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:53:06.949 --> 00:53:08.409]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:16.289]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.190]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:53:18.369 --> 00:53:21.650]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.570]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:26.710]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:33.619]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:53:34.099 --> 00:53:39.719]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.539]  That continues.
[00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:41.559]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:53:41.659 --> 00:53:44.400]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:53:44.579 --> 00:53:45.199]  I designed it.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.119]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:51.619]  And they are a fundraiser.
[00:53:51.719 --> 00:53:53.099]  They are a piece of history.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.119]  They're pure silver.
[00:53:55.519 --> 00:53:58.000]  They are minted here in America.
[00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.369]  2,000 of these.
[00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.809]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.210]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:08.449]  They are incredible.
[00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:15.230]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:23.380]  And the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over Infowars next week, they're not going to shut down the AlexShieldsStore.com.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.679]  That is our main sponsor with the AlexShields Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.619]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:43.670]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:54:43.929 --> 00:54:46.269]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:49.369]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.409]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:54.949]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:56.809]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.039]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:00.179 --> 00:55:02.320]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:55:02.519 --> 00:55:03.559]  They surprised me with this.
[00:55:03.639 --> 00:55:04.659]  I just learned this morning.
[00:55:04.699 --> 00:55:11.360]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that, the big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:11.539 --> 00:55:16.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:55:16.659 --> 00:55:19.579]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:19.719 --> 00:55:21.599]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.380]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:26.440]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.239]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.039]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.980]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.059]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:37.880]  And I already called them.
[00:55:38.019 --> 00:55:40.019]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:40.940]  So that means there's...
[00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:44.420]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:55:44.579 --> 00:55:47.119]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:55:47.519 --> 00:55:49.519]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:55:49.659 --> 00:55:50.800]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.019]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:55:52.159 --> 00:55:53.760]  This baby is amazing.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:59.119]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:06.300]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine, the ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[00:56:06.639 --> 00:56:14.440]  Fully Posable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:22.599]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump meeting inaugurated next month.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.420]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:56:24.639 --> 00:56:32.659]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot Year, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:42.019 --> 00:56:45.039]  Alright, look, I'm going to lay some really heavy stuff on you right now.
[00:56:48.679 --> 00:56:51.699]  So, history repeats, right?
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.639]  So, where are we right now?
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:57:06.340]  We have a competing global power blocks with the West way out ahead of China and Russia when it comes to building a breakaway civilization.
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:23.239]  That's transferred most of the technology into it, forbidden from the general public in the world, that has a anti-depopulation agenda, that sees the rest of civilization as a competing force,
[00:57:23.239 --> 00:57:29.900]  that wants to get total control over the planet, so that no one else can oppose its dictatorship.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.059]  That's why Obama and others call it the end of history.
[00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:37.900]  The end of history for us, the end of competition for us, not for this group.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:58:00.460]  So if you look at all the ancient religions and histories all over the planet, in every recorded document, from the first they find to the latest, seeing the same stuff, and now what we see deployed acts and behaves just the same,
[00:58:00.719 --> 00:58:02.179]  you can say, well, they're just copying it.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.239]  Okay, or they were given it.
[00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:24.030]  But what I see and what I receive is that this civilization is attempting to duplicate what has been done before, that there have been previous advanced human civilizations that are breakaway,
[00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:54.380]  and that they did breakaway, And they did go interstellar and beyond and that it was decided to keep a museum or a national park or a repository a depository like a seed bank like they have up in the Arctic so there
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:59:00.079]  would always be An original operating Eden.
[00:59:02.139 --> 00:59:15.659]  Because obviously if you came from a planet and there's a history to that, there's a nostalgia, but there's also an importance, then you don't want to mess it up.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.619]  You go out and you do the testing and the new dangerous stuff away from mommy.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.280]  Away from the old homestead.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.300]  And then, now there's the ancient astronaut at Peru.
[00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:38.420]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:59:39.739 --> 00:59:50.460]  And the sin is doing what we've done before here.
[00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:54.530]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:55.050]  Stay with me.
[00:59:55.650 --> 01:00:06.349]  Almost every one of these unidentified flying objects, UAVs, all of it, is demonstrably obviously human like what you see on screen.
[01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:11.630]  Those are just four propeller medium-sized drones.
[01:00:12.849 --> 01:00:17.349]  So why is the shadow government, the breakaway civilization...
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:29.039]  Toying with most of the people at the Pentagon who are not read in on this, and the governors and the FBI, and flaunting all of this.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.480]  Well, there's a lot there.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:42.440]  But if you're going to have a breakaway civilization, at a certain point when it starts absorbing the old civilization...
[01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:51.320]  We're good to go.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.269]  And you use that as a destabilizing force.
[01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:16.309]  So you don't just keep the advanced civilization away from people.
[01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:20.050]  You roll it out, but you terrorize people and don't tell you it's human.
[01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:24.829]  Or more than human.
[01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:27.829]  More human than human.
[01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:29.690]  That's our goal here at Tyrell Corporation.
[01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:50.739]  So Elon Musk, and we got some breaking news here, I'll get to in a moment, comes out this morning at 2.01 a.m.,
[01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:52.460]  and he posts this.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.460]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:01:55.599 --> 01:02:11.230]  It shows what looks like a city in Iran below an Ayatollah, Khomeini type, Flying on top of a classic flying saucer.
[01:02:15.929 --> 01:02:19.650]  And it says, everyone, please stop creating fake narratives for war.
[01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:20.329]  Government.
[01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:26.690]  And I got so many calls when I woke up this morning and texts asking me about this, and I'd already seen it.
[01:02:26.769 --> 01:02:29.090]  I got up, looked at it, and noticed I had a bunch of texts about it.
[01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:30.989]  Saying, why is Elon making jokes?
[01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:32.630]  This doesn't mean anything.
[01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:34.010]  What the hell it doesn't?
[01:02:34.489 --> 01:02:35.590]  Elon Musk...
[01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:44.880]  He perfectly said a thousand words with that.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:58.679]  Because that's in response to the federal government floating the idea and others yesterday that Iran has a mothership off the coast.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.139]  They've been saying that for a year.
[01:03:00.219 --> 01:03:02.480]  Oh, there's some secret mothership out there that's doing it.
[01:03:02.539 --> 01:03:03.360]  Oh, it's the Iranians.
[01:03:03.519 --> 01:03:07.019]  Yeah, and the Iranians tried to kill Trump and Butler and had the Secret Service stand down.
[01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.510]  And the Iranians had the Secret Service stand down in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:20.030]  And the other CIA minion showed up to kill him.
[01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:26.829]  Because they were mad that Trump wanted to end the Ukraine war.
[01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:29.030]  Who wants that to keep going?
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:29.849]  The globalists, the deep state.
[01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:36.750]  So he's saying here, and it's like people watched Civil War this year and said, we don't really know the plot.
[01:03:36.869 --> 01:03:38.610]  You don't know who the bad guys are or the good guys are.
[01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:40.210]  I read that from conservative publications.
[01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:49.230]  And I'm like, that's why we're in so much trouble, because you are about as perceptive as a rock.
[01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.849]  It would take me an hour to explain it, but it's like...
[01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:06.809]  Four minutes into it, I turn to my wife, and I go, because I hadn't read the plot, wanted to just see it myself.
[01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:09.349]  I knew it was Hollywood, so I knew what was going to happen.
[01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:21.570]  And you got a bunch of migrants and leftists out at a food truck, and somebody with an American flag, a white person, runs in and blows them up and suicide bombs them.
[01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:25.449]  Okay, so a white person with an American flag...
[01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:28.730]  Huge American flag waving behind him.
[01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:31.170]  Blows up a bunch of brown people.
[01:04:33.409 --> 01:04:34.510]  This is a race war.
[01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:48.230]  And then you've got white soldiers on the approaches to D.C. in the South fighting a bunch of Che Guevara guys and white people and black folks, but it's an army of liberals.
[01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.650]  And all the soldiers they're killing are white.
[01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:52.809]  That isn't obvious enough.
[01:04:52.809 --> 01:05:03.469]  They're in small towns and They don't seem affected by it all, and it's all these white people, and they make little comments about how weird it is, but there's men on the roofs, so they act like everything's fine, but it's not.
[01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:04.929]  You're in a tyranny of the white man.
[01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:11.769]  And then they go to this other house and find crazy white guys that have just filled a pit full of brown migrants they've killed.
[01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:24.840]  And then, but don't worry, the U.S. military really cited the Western alliance What's it called?
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.400]  The Western Alliance.
[01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:26.739]  It's a global section of anti-Western.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:30.840]  And then the main military goes in and beats the people that stayed with Trump.
[01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:34.699]  And they go into the White House and they kill all the Secret Service who are all white men.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.860]  Washbush-looking white guys.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.380]  And then they kill the Trump figure, the black sergeant does, the black woman.
[01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:50.309]  Now, simultaneously, they had battle plans that if Trump had won, they were going to do that.
[01:05:50.429 --> 01:05:59.309]  And now they're trying to run that plan again if he gets back in to foment a race war and then have the military leadership side with them and trick the general military into going along with it.
[01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:01.989]  And Podesta admits that's the plan.
[01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:06.869]  So, it's the same thing here.
[01:06:07.449 --> 01:06:23.949]  Elon Musk, 100% crystal clear with just a simple meme that With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 words tells you exactly what's going on.
[01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:37.869]  Everyone, please stop creating fake narratives for war, which is all we've been seeing for years, forever.
[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:39.750]  WMDs in Iraq didn't exist, yeah.
[01:06:40.809 --> 01:06:45.690]  Start the war in Ukraine, NATO, then say the Russians did it, on, on, on.
[01:06:46.449 --> 01:06:48.369]  You know, the Russians blew up the Nord Stream pipeline, all these lies.
[01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.809]  And then the government starts coming out going, oh, it's the Iranians, oh, yeah.
[01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:04.650]  And Elon says, this is meant to push war with Iran, which means war with Russia, everybody else.
[01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:07.469]  And that's what I said yesterday.
[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:13.329]  I said that a lot of this is anti-missile defense systems to show the Russians, oh, you think we can't stop your ballistic missiles?
[01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:19.530]  You know, the one in Ukraine that got through, that Putin demonstrated a few weeks ago?
[01:07:19.989 --> 01:07:20.670]  There's that.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.000]  Then it creates this fear, this background fear of what are all these things?
[01:07:25.159 --> 01:07:25.940]  Maybe it's the Russians.
[01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:27.179]  Maybe it's the Iranians.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]  Elon Musk is.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.579]  It's not the Russians.
[01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:31.960]  It's not the Iranians.
[01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:40.139]  It's the deep state wanting to create fear, a subconscious fear, a conscious fear, unknown, the idea you're being assaulted.
[01:07:40.239 --> 01:07:42.440]  So those areas of your mind are turned on.
[01:07:44.949 --> 01:07:55.610]  To make you feel more threatened by a virus that they say is going to stop the Trump agenda and by he's a racist and a race war is going to stop the agenda and oh my god there's all these drones there's all these UFOs what is it?
[01:07:56.929 --> 01:08:12.079]  And that's the bare minimum I'm saying in the last few days is this is a message to Russia and others we got a lot of advanced technology you don't know about and we're going to tell the public it's you meaning we can attack the public And say it's you.
[01:08:12.579 --> 01:08:22.539]  Which could be the main pretext I've said for full war with Russia or China is to launch an attack and say Russia did it or China did it or whoever did it and then say but we can't prove it.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.100]  So there's a major psyop going on here.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:41.380]  And So I agree with Elon's statement.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.260]  And I'm glad that he's responded.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.880]  Because he said nothing.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.920]  And every time he gets asked about extraterrestrials, what he thinks, oh, I don't think, we don't have any proof of that.
[01:08:53.119 --> 01:08:55.060]  I don't know, you know, we're such a big universe.
[01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:02.859]  And that's because there's so much classification.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.859]  But NASA has released...
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:17.920]  And you look at this footage of the space stations, and here come these white orbs that are checking the craft out in the 80s, the 90s, 2000s.
[01:09:18.119 --> 01:09:19.859]  The last 20 years, it's happened a bunch.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:31.699]  And this is the stuff described before the Wright brothers a hundred and something years ago.
[01:09:32.579 --> 01:09:35.260]  This is something described by the ancients over and over again.
[01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:40.210]  I mean, look at this.
[01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:44.170]  And isn't that what you're seeing today?
[01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:48.689]  This is from 1994. This video's been looked at back at the time, confirmed that's real.
[01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:57.630]  Craft fly up, check out the fishing boat, and then zoom off.
[01:10:02.409 --> 01:10:02.810]  So...
[01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:09.510]  This is a big issue.
[01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.949]  And it's not as simple as some people would try to make it.
[01:10:17.829 --> 01:10:33.369]  But from all the ancient text and research, and also my understanding, because there's so much complex info, people call it their gut, that really that's the trillions of data points we all have on even one given subject,
[01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:43.720]  and the knowledge that You'll ask somebody that's really wise and has a lot of wisdom about a particular topic they've studied, and they'll say, well, I can't really tell you exactly why I know this, but this is why.
[01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.619]  And people know that person's always right, basically.
[01:10:47.479 --> 01:10:52.500]  They can maybe misinterpret what the feeling is and get it wrong occasionally, but they're almost always right.
[01:10:53.699 --> 01:10:54.920]  Their gut's always right.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.500]  Sometimes the conscious mind misinterprets the gut.
[01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:04.920]  But the gut's always right, and my gut knows what this is.
[01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:38.090]  So the stuff they say is alien is an advanced ancient breakaway human civilization that if you look at it is predatory and sees us as cattle and for whatever reason Isn't running a lot of operations
[01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.930]  outside the planet.
[01:11:40.789 --> 01:11:43.630]  Well, what does the Bible tell us?
[01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.670]  The Old Testament, it says that Satan is a creature.
[01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:51.229]  He's got an army.
[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.229]  And he's marooned here.
[01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:59.250]  And that he's been working with humans since he got here.
[01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:07.210]  And that he's been having his crew mate with us and create hybrids.
[01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:15.409]  And God doesn't like that.
[01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:21.609]  Now you say, well, okay, that's ancient text everywhere.
[01:12:21.869 --> 01:12:23.529]  Every other ancient culture said the same thing as the Bible.
[01:12:23.789 --> 01:12:24.810]  Same story over and over again.
[01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.949]  Exactly the same story.
[01:12:28.789 --> 01:12:33.310]  We don't know why they all got that and separately thousands of miles away said that, so let's just...
[01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:37.029]  Okay, well, what's Bill Gates and the globalists in the New World Order doing right now?
[01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:42.390]  They're injecting us with stuff they say protects us that erases our immune system, changes our DNA, mutates us.
[01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:52.630]  Already consumers can go to Mexico and get injected with gene therapy that'll make your muscles get twice as big in six months and make you lose all your weight.
[01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:57.250]  But a whole bunch of, quote, gene therapies that do it.
[01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.149]  It kills you some of the time.
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:02.810]  I mean, this is the year 2024. This stuff is old.
[01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:05.250]  And not just old since I saw it in the literature.
[01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:08.869]  Everything you hear about as new is at least 30, 40, 50 years old.
[01:13:09.569 --> 01:13:11.590]  And that's in our civilization.
[01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:18.729]  I mean, let's talk about compartmentalization.
[01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:21.449]  You're like 10, 11, 12, your parents...
[01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:27.899]  Or out to dinner, and you're digging around your parents' stuff, and you find the Playboy magazines.
[01:13:28.859 --> 01:13:30.439]  That's compartmentalized information.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:37.600]  Or you get into your parents' love letters to each other in college, and you start reading those.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.479]  Or you find your mom's diary and start reading it.
[01:13:40.539 --> 01:13:41.720]  See, that's compartmentalization.
[01:13:41.979 --> 01:13:46.800]  And you learn all this stuff you've never known, that you never would, and you're obviously embarrassed you know it.
[01:13:46.819 --> 01:13:49.239]  It's not really bad, but, you know, this is, wow, wow.
[01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:57.029]  Well, see, this isn't your parents' bedroom or closet you're digging around in or the attic.
[01:13:58.109 --> 01:14:06.029]  Or Grandpa dies and you're digging through the closet and, you know, and even Grandma and everybody didn't know that, wow, Grandpa was a war hero?
[01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.350]  Well, no, he never told us that.
[01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:22.090]  There's a lot of good stuff you learn from decompartmentalizing, but take all that decompartmentalization, Dad's Playboys and take it up about a trillion percent.
[01:14:23.369 --> 01:14:39.390]  And this show is about getting everyone on all these subjects to realize there's a lot of stuff we're not being told or given and there's ways to discover it and find it out and we need to.
[01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:46.210]  It's vital to the future of organic, free, open human civilization.
[01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.949]  Because where we're going is what the ancients described.
[01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:59.930]  The fallen ones using us as genetic experiments, enslaving us, torturing us, killing us.
[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:09.470]  You'd say, well, I don't know if those ancient Egyptian and other texts...
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.180]  And of course, Samaria is the main mother load of it all.
[01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:23.100]  When they decoded tens of thousands of these tablets, I mean, it reads like science fiction.
[01:15:23.239 --> 01:15:24.140]  But it's not.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.340]  And it's carvings of the creatures and all of it.
[01:15:28.319 --> 01:15:31.739]  And the ships, the humanoids, they got robots.
[01:15:32.359 --> 01:15:35.420]  They describe those, machines, metal men.
[01:15:38.989 --> 01:15:41.489]  If somebody did something they didn't like, they'd just burst into flame.
[01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:49.170]  Or a hovering pillar of fire would fly up with dozens of swords and, as I would describe, chop you up.
[01:15:55.729 --> 01:16:00.329]  So, you can say, this didn't exist.
[01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:05.909]  Okay, well, what's the globalist goal?
[01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.029]  What are they building right now?
[01:16:10.069 --> 01:16:12.350]  What are they doing to us right now?
[01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:24.189]  Well, it's what the Bible describes Satan was doing, and God didn't like it, and that only certain populations were pure in their generations.
[01:16:24.909 --> 01:16:27.250]  Noah wasn't a pure man.
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:29.689]  He got drunk and stuff, all of that.
[01:16:29.909 --> 01:16:32.770]  He wasn't pure in his actions.
[01:16:33.869 --> 01:16:35.890]  His genetics were pure.
[01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:54.140]  And God said, Satan's forces, the giants, and you look at the Sumerians and all that, and it's these giants, and there's tablets of them having sex with women, 15 foot,
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.500]  20 tall, with a woman on their lap.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:02.119]  Then it shows the next thing, their babies they made.
[01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.100]  Boy, those Sumerians really came up with some stuff.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.699]  These big ships land with fire coming out the bottom and start screwing the women.
[01:17:11.649 --> 01:17:13.069]  And then out pops these things.
[01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:16.170]  And then God says, I'm going to wipe that out.
[01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:21.989]  And God says again, you do this again, I'm going to wipe you out again.
[01:17:23.069 --> 01:17:25.350]  And then Plato says this was all going on.
[01:17:26.369 --> 01:17:30.550]  2,200 plus years ago, he wrote about it saying it happened between 10,000 and 12,000 years before.
[01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:40.850]  And what are they doing right now with all these shots, all these different cocktails they put in it?
[01:17:44.199 --> 01:18:04.939]  All a mass test of mutating humans and attacking our DNA, and if you think they're splicing walking stick, that was one of them, walking stick genes into salmon and releasing them in the ocean, what do you think they're doing to us?
[01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:09.800]  So...
[01:18:13.579 --> 01:18:15.079]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[01:18:15.779 --> 01:18:20.840]  So whether this existed or not, there's another theory you could have.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:36.800]  Our genetic memory, our epigenetics, the encoded knowledge of our ancestors that's passed on at the cellular level, that has to be unlocked normally through rites of passage, events, things that happen.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:53.279]  We are imprinted with this information and it's not yet happened yet, but it's a genetic message and a warning.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.659]  Don't do this or this will happen.
[01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:09.380]  Except you have all the different ancient cultures seeing the flying saucer craft, the orbs and the spinning wheels and all the rest of it.
[01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:25.340]  And then you realize we've never been where we thought we were.
[01:19:25.819 --> 01:19:28.960]  We've obviously never been what we thought we were.
[01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:37.079]  Because the church and the system took those ancient texts and distorted them.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.239]  Go to your Catholic priest.
[01:19:39.439 --> 01:19:40.659]  Go to your Baptist preacher.
[01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:49.850]  You read them Genesis and Ezekiel and all that and a seven-year-old They'd never heard about any of this.
[01:19:49.909 --> 01:19:55.689]  You could read to them this stuff and they'd say, those are aliens or those are us.
[01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:58.390]  Or those are something like us.
[01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:08.029]  But the preacher, oh no, that's an analogy or that doesn't say that.
[01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:09.470]  Well, the hell it doesn't.
[01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:26.119]  And then how does the preacher explain everything from medieval Christians to To Aztecs that didn't even know each other but were around at the same time, painting and carving flying saucers with portals on them.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.619]  With propulsion systems coming out the bottom.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:36.859]  See?
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:45.800]  But the truth is, when you get higher up in these secret orders and globalist organizations, they read these people in on this, but not all of it.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:53.079]  And tell them, oh, you're going to be part of the future, you're part of the anointed, because you don't tell the little people this stuff.
[01:20:56.539 --> 01:21:01.079]  So, the average globalist knows exactly what they're doing, even their mid-level ones.
[01:21:02.439 --> 01:21:13.060]  And they believe they've been given a directive by the bad guys that are giving them the technology again to set up a tyranny.
[01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:16.890]  Not to empower.
[01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:24.489]  They believe they're going to have a seat at the table, and they believe, yeah, there's one of the medieval paintings, a bunch of them.
[01:21:27.069 --> 01:21:42.850]  They believe that they're going to be given life extension, but, oh, in all the texts and all the globalists, now externalization of the hierarchy where they admit it, oh, the future's not human, oh, we're about to become a new species, mergeable machines that are good for the earth that don't put out carbon.
[01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:45.289]  Carbon's what creates the atmosphere and keeps it going.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.180]  But from day one, they're like, we're getting rid of the carbon.
[01:21:49.359 --> 01:21:54.220]  And I've got mainline news today saying we want to tax breathing.
[01:21:54.579 --> 01:21:56.380]  All humans are bad, not just cows.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.460]  Well, of course they teach you cows are bad, now you're bad.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.060]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:22:00.479 --> 01:22:04.039]  It is an anti-carbon-based life form attack.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.500]  And it gets us to build the system that replaces us and destroys it.
[01:22:11.949 --> 01:22:15.310]  And we have to have a global awakening to this.
[01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:17.989]  Take control of our directed evolution.
[01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:25.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at InfoWars.
[01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:30.829]  And our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in just a few weeks.
[01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:35.810]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs, our limited edition, right now at thealextownstore.com.
[01:22:36.029 --> 01:22:36.869]  Talk about fun.
[01:22:36.989 --> 01:22:39.170]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:44.149]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street or at work at their Christmas party.
[01:22:44.369 --> 01:22:49.210]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[01:22:49.369 --> 01:22:52.829]  Ah, then of course there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:55.050]  Trump one, I'm afraid.
[01:22:55.829 --> 01:23:00.489]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs, the AlexJonesStore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:02.489]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[01:23:02.729 --> 01:23:05.869]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.270]  Can you hear us now?
[01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:10.569]  And the AlexJonesStore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:12.710]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:16.289]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:16.569 --> 01:23:21.350]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.050]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:25.529]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:32.210]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?
[01:23:32.789 --> 01:23:33.890]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[01:23:34.069 --> 01:23:35.409]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[01:23:35.649 --> 01:23:39.289]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[01:23:39.489 --> 01:23:41.050]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.270]  If you're blown away by these designs, this is just a few of them.
[01:23:43.449 --> 01:23:46.409]  There's over 200 designs right now at theallshowstore.com.
[01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:48.350]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[01:23:48.529 --> 01:23:49.369]  God bless you all.
[01:23:49.369 --> 01:23:50.310]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:53.750]  Ho ho ho!
[01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:55.489]  Merry Christmas!
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:29.960]  Dark journalist Daniel List, one of the most informed people on the subject of the UAV's UFO phenomenon, integrating with history, politics, secret societies, breakaway civilizations, COG, and more, will be joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:24:30.439 --> 01:24:36.180]  There's been some other developments that have just been breaking with the state and local and federal governments.
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.979]  Asking Biden what's going on right now.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.960]  So we'll get to that new development here in a moment.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.060]  Please remember, I'm taking on the deep state.
[01:24:45.319 --> 01:24:46.579]  I'm taking on the Democratic Party.
[01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:47.279]  We're winning.
[01:24:47.439 --> 01:24:48.920]  You just saw the big court victory Tuesday.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.500]  But there's a bunch of big fights to come.
[01:24:51.699 --> 01:24:53.039]  This is a long struggle.
[01:24:54.090 --> 01:25:00.170]  So, supporting the broadcast is critical, and we make it easy for you to do at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:16.829]  And whatever happens to InfoWars, that's not owned by me, that's the sponsor, that will continue, if InfoWars continues helping InfoWars, or it will continue helping the Alex Jones Network at AJNLive on X. The sites are getting built, the studios, the one of them's done, the bigger one's getting finished in the next few weeks.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.699]  You'll see that.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:22.340]  Regardless, it'll just be rolled into this operation if it survives.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.579]  But we're not...
[01:25:24.239 --> 01:25:25.979]  We're going to just sit there and roll the dice on that.
[01:25:26.079 --> 01:25:40.239]  So we are busy in our critical mission to decentralize information and get the public aware of what's going on so that the general civilization that has this breakaway predatory civilization trying to absorb it and collapse it can be stopped.
[01:25:40.359 --> 01:25:46.420]  But you've got to admit that's what's going on to understand that's going on and then it all makes perfect sense and that's what's happening.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.579]  It's not my opinion.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.819]  The globalists admit this.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.720]  They just won't get into details of it.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.479]  But we've reverse engineered the thing.
[01:25:54.569 --> 01:25:59.510]  We're going to talk about this coming up in a moment, but it's so easy to support the broadcast.
[01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:02.949]  Believe me, you want to go to thealexshownstore.com.
[01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:04.649]  It's been sold out for more than three months.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:09.439]  Optimal Human is the strongest, best, superfood, green drink out there.
[01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.220]  There's a lot of great brands out there, and they're amazing.
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.199]  You get super good absorption.
[01:26:14.159 --> 01:26:15.359]  Green capsules are great, too.
[01:26:15.479 --> 01:26:17.880]  But this is so good.
[01:26:17.979 --> 01:26:20.840]  And the concentrated herbs in it give you amazing focus, clarity, energy.

[01:29:54.909 --> 01:29:56.050]  This is your fight.
[01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.850]  You're keeping us on air.
[01:29:56.909 --> 01:29:57.569]  We appreciate it.
[01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:09.750]  So, I've just spent an hour and 30 plus minutes with my historical breakdown looking at the breakaway civilization that they admit they're building.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.779]  How advanced it is.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.880]  We need to learn the opportunity of Trump saying he's going to come in and declassify this.
[01:30:16.199 --> 01:30:23.260]  The fact that RFK Jr. is making a move on the Breakaway Civilizations program to destroy our genetics, poison us, sterilize us, dumb us down.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:38.279]  The decision's been made to dynamite, to demolish, to destroy the current civilization, and on its ashes, Have the breakaway civilization that's already there take full control.
[01:30:38.619 --> 01:30:40.460]  That is the Great Reset, build back better.
[01:30:41.319 --> 01:30:51.659]  Just as we use the skeletons of ocean creatures and invertebrates to build our highways, that's what sand is.
[01:30:52.079 --> 01:31:01.300]  They want to build their super technology post-human cyborg system on us.
[01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:10.010]  And they claim to their minions, oh, we'll leave a few hundred million people alive, and you can still be human if you want, or you can become the new super sapien.
[01:31:10.529 --> 01:31:11.609]  The future's not human.
[01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:14.750]  Do any of you actually serving this think you're going to be left alive as well?
[01:31:15.329 --> 01:31:23.729]  No, they convince you to wipe out most of the people, and then, oh, we can't trust this group, let's wipe them out, and well, this group's arguing, it doesn't like the plan, so wipe them out.
[01:31:24.859 --> 01:31:30.979]  I postulate there could be two globalists left in this new future hellscape and they would turn on each other.
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:31.800]  That's obvious.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.479]  Well, I can't trust that one.
[01:31:35.079 --> 01:31:43.020]  That's their argument against decentralizing having a bunch of breakaway civilizations where people can decide what civilization they want to be part of and have it transparent and open.
[01:31:43.159 --> 01:31:49.380]  Well, one of those breakaway civilizations will start giving us the information and then they'll become more advanced and come and enslave us.
[01:31:50.439 --> 01:32:00.970]  You can't decide to stay in an agrarian kind of Neo-Amish system because, well, you'll be overtaken by those that have technology.
[01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:06.449]  That's why only a moral human system can survive.
[01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:14.869]  Thomas Jefferson said, yeah, we can have a great open free society, but you've got to have moral, informed, active people that believe in free will.
[01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.109]  And that's really what a type 1 civilization is.
[01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:19.869]  You must live and let live.
[01:32:19.869 --> 01:32:23.750]  You must allow people to have freedom as long as it doesn't infringe on your freedom.
[01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:28.869]  But you've got to stand up for yourself or we will destroy ourselves.
[01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:32.289]  Just as the mythical Atlantis destroyed itself.
[01:32:32.989 --> 01:32:33.989]  History repeats.
[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:39.609]  And so now you've got the governors and the FBI and the legislatures.
[01:32:39.789 --> 01:32:40.310]  Here's the newest one.
[01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:41.710]  State of New Jersey.
[01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:48.470]  Sending letters to the President of the United States.
[01:32:51.329 --> 01:32:54.909]  From the governor and the legislature saying we've got to know what this is.
[01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.090]  These UAVs.
[01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:02.729]  They no longer call it UASs and all the rest of it.
[01:33:03.989 --> 01:33:05.050]  Unidentified systems.
[01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:17.270]  So, obviously a giant PSYOP. We're going to get our very astute guest for the next hour and 16 minutes to just go over it all.
[01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:18.470]  Elon Musk.
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:21.170]  Finally breaking in silence about it.
[01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:27.710]  With this image, everyone, please stop creating fake war narratives for war.
[01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:28.430]  Government.
[01:33:28.649 --> 01:33:29.890]  Oh, Iran's going to attack us.
[01:33:29.949 --> 01:33:33.170]  And again, state governments and others try to claim it was Iran.
[01:33:33.329 --> 01:33:33.930]  They've been floating that.
[01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:35.909]  And Elon is obviously saying, this is not Iran.
[01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:39.649]  And the feds are saying, and the military, oh, we don't know what it is.
[01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:40.689]  That's pure crap.
[01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.909]  Now, are there crap that they don't know what are, that have been around before?
[01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:46.109]  We know the deep state had a lot of this technology.
[01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.590]  Yes.
[01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.970]  Yes.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.399]  We've observed this.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.060]  We've studied this.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.239]  We have historical comparisons.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:59.119]  We know this stuff was going on before we discovered electricity or rediscovered it.
[01:33:59.699 --> 01:34:08.340]  Because now they're digging up for hundreds of years and now they've been digging up all sorts of machines and devices that the Romans and the Greeks and the Chinese had.
[01:34:09.159 --> 01:34:13.300]  So We've been here before, something very similar to it.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.140]  Joining us is one of the leading experts on this, Dark Journalist, Daniel List.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:25.920]  He's at darkjournalist.com and on YouTube at Dark Journalist and also on X. And I can ask a lot of questions and he always answers them and does a great job.
[01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:32.840]  And I got a ton of them, but I just want to kind of give him the floor until he got a break in 14 minutes to go where he wants to go first.
[01:34:33.039 --> 01:34:35.279]  Then we'll continue on to the next hour and I've got my questions.
[01:34:36.159 --> 01:34:37.319]  Daniel, thanks for being with us.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.119]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:34:41.369 --> 01:34:42.109]  Wild time.
[01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:42.850]  Well, you've got the floor.
[01:34:42.949 --> 01:34:43.770]  Where do you want to go first?
[01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.829]  Absolutely.
[01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:46.890]  Well, you've been breaking it down quite well.
[01:34:47.029 --> 01:34:47.710]  I've been enjoying it.
[01:34:47.869 --> 01:34:48.789]  I'll tell you this.
[01:34:48.909 --> 01:35:04.210]  It's interesting when you mention Musk as well, because Musk, if you go through his X threads there on September 30th, did in fact put out a post that said drone swarms are coming and they're going to be beyond belief.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.939]  Now, that's a prediction that he made back there, September 30th.
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:08.539]  You're right, I'm wrong.
[01:35:08.619 --> 01:35:13.399]  And it was a connotation, I think, to China in saying the F-30 whatever is a piece of crap.
[01:35:13.859 --> 01:35:15.279]  You're right, he did say something.
[01:35:15.399 --> 01:35:16.199]  Guys, pull that up.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.180]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.960]  Yeah, and it's interesting to me because he's got that inside track.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.279]  There's no question about it.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:27.279]  Now, I've put on the record before that he can't say anything about UFOs, given his position.
[01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:30.819]  And that's a problem because he certainly knows a great deal about them.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.510]  But he can't talk about them because of his relationship with With the government in space.
[01:35:35.989 --> 01:35:37.989]  And he's privatized.
[01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:42.670]  There's no doubt he's trying to get more inside that government box with Trump.
[01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:45.710]  But it's a private organization, SpaceX, let's remember.
[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:50.989]  And there are groups out there like DARPA, etc., that you need agreements with just to operate up there.
[01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:54.310]  And you need those agreements with the Air Force and the Space Force.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:01.439]  So there's no way that he can let things out, as it were, and talk about the UFO file, although he knows a great deal about it.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.920]  There's another thing about the types of imagery that they collect.
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:11.300]  And if the U.S. spy satellites are collecting those and SpaceX collects them, then they have to turn all that over.
[01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:19.739]  So I do think what we're looking at here is something which I've tried to put on the record before, which is they've created a UFO threat.
[01:36:20.329 --> 01:36:28.770]  And the UFO threat gives them the ultimate ability to call in an emergency powers situation and activate a continuity of government program.
[01:36:29.029 --> 01:36:32.170]  That's the kind of crisscross that's been building up in the background.
[01:36:32.409 --> 01:36:35.689]  And on some level, it's a high risk gamble on their side.
[01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:38.989]  So there's been a lot of trial balloons in relation to this.
[01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:44.029]  Now when we look at the New Jersey situation, it's interesting that a lot of this started right in Monmouth.
[01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:50.289]  And if you go into the history of Monmouth, that's where the exotic technology was developed very early on.
[01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:53.449]  And they shut that base down once it became known.
[01:36:53.750 --> 01:37:02.310]  And it's very interesting if you go through it now because just recently Netflix bought 300 acres over there in Monmouth.
[01:37:02.529 --> 01:37:07.850]  And we have all these unusual things with Netflix around the UFO file.
[01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:14.350]  For example, President Obama financed a movie about Betty and Barney Hill and their abduction experience.
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.489]  So there's something major going live.
[01:37:16.489 --> 01:37:27.229]  What I see technically happening, though, with the drone swarms and with all the reports and how there's a split between what the government is saying, which is total whitewash and absurd, that it's just planes, etc.
[01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:29.810]  People are used to planes.
[01:37:29.949 --> 01:37:31.350]  This is definitely a drone swarm.
[01:37:31.449 --> 01:37:32.630]  And it's a test.
[01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:38.109]  And the question is, will that test go live into a full-blown emergency power situation?
[01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:41.289]  That's the activation of the person who set that up.
[01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:46.270]  They wanna go beyond, they wanna go to the third level of this and get into emergency powers.
[01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:58.050]  Once you have emergency powers activated, then Gregory Guillaume, who is the general that runs NORTHCOM, and he also is in charge of NORAD, and he's the COG combatant commander.
[01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:02.890]  He becomes the complete ruler of the United States and sets out regional governors.
[01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:07.529]  And the regional governors that he sets up are supposed to be there until we can have an election sometime.
[01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:10.109]  After the alien invasion eases up.
[01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:19.750]  But definitely what they're doing with the drones, yes, we know drone technology, so they're UFOs, but they're technically known.
[01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:28.149]  And the problem is, what they need to do is roll this out and get the test back and get the type of data back that they need.
[01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:31.890]  And then they can see whether or not they can make this test go live.
[01:38:32.069 --> 01:38:46.890]  And when we've seen drills and things in the past that went live, If you look at all the deep events through history, whether it's 9-11 or the different financial crashes and things, there's always a drill that's taking place, as we know, close by.
[01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:48.510]  And so this is the drill.
[01:38:52.079 --> 01:38:56.579]  Of the UFO threat thing that's been pushed by the intelligence community.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:07.239]  And they've sent a lot of people out there running these congressional hearings, especially in the past two years, but from 2017 in the New York Times article on UFOs.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.279]  And that's what you said a few years ago.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:23.220]  That's what Greer said, that they're planting these people, they're giving them disinfo to prime and say, okay, it is alien, but to prepare it for when they roll this out, to then have the public actually believe that and to believe the government.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.439]  Most of the government doesn't know, but some of the government does know.
[01:39:27.359 --> 01:39:28.500]  What are some of the...
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:34.720]  Well, keep going, and then next hour I want to ask you, looking at the pre-programming, what scenarios do you think they might be preparing?
[01:39:34.979 --> 01:39:35.539]  But go ahead.
[01:39:36.739 --> 01:39:37.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:37.779 --> 01:39:39.039]  And that's exactly right.
[01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:45.579]  They rolled out these guys in several different hearing situations and they really tested this whole theme out.
[01:39:45.699 --> 01:39:51.399]  And they experimented with everything from the UFO threat, the bodies and everything else as far as they could go.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:40:05.310]  One of the things that I noticed that's been coming up a lot is that the same groups that are really kind of showing up in the middle of this with the UFO threat program, Are showing up and commenting on the drone swarms.
[01:40:05.729 --> 01:40:16.890]  And one of the things I want to say on the realistic side is you could indeed have had a genuine UFO situation where they said, you know, we're tracking these UFOs.
[01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:22.989]  Let's see if we can create a gigantic diversion over here and get people off of looking at the real thing.
[01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:25.770]  There's no question there could be an aspect of that involved.
[01:40:25.829 --> 01:40:38.130]  And I think when you get around New York and New Jersey, it's very interesting because There was a program in October of 2010 where they had a huge sighting over New York City.
[01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:42.770]  And it was October 13th, 2010, where all of these lights were seen just sitting over the city.
[01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.729]  There's another one further back, which is the Phoenix Lights program.
[01:40:45.729 --> 01:40:51.689]  But they got a great deal of data mining from these programs about how the public would respond in the event of a UFO emergency.
[01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:57.289]  Then they went through the whole thing about setting up Arrow, which is the UFO Defense Office.
[01:40:57.449 --> 01:41:00.789]  And ultimately, it was Senator Gillibrand out of New York.
[01:41:00.789 --> 01:41:04.250]  And again, this is the area where the sightings are taking place, New Jersey, New York.
[01:41:04.989 --> 01:41:10.229]  But Gillibrand was the main one who pushed it through and attached it to the National Defense Authorization Act.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:20.060]  Now, this is the thing about the NDAA. If she got the UFO Defense Office placed there, if anyone tried to challenge it, it would hold up over a trillion dollars in spending.
[01:41:20.279 --> 01:41:22.140]  So they attached it there through the back door.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:31.600]  And it's quite interesting to note that the person who helped her do it was Marco Rubio, interestingly enough, who spoke out a great deal suddenly about the UFO file.
[01:41:32.159 --> 01:41:36.800]  Over the past two years, and of course now he's going to be Secretary of State, which is very interesting.
[01:41:36.979 --> 01:41:42.359]  Daniel, let me stop you again, because you're knocking it out of the park here, but that makes perfect sense what you're saying.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:54.859]  They're inoculating people psychologically with their own things, and then acting like those are aliens, so that when the real thing shows up, or another government does, there's nothing, people don't panic because they're just used to it.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.359]  Yes, exactly.
[01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:59.199]  And if you go, I mean, you can track through the history.
[01:41:59.319 --> 01:42:06.180]  They had a huge swarm over the White House in 1952. That's how far back we're going with this.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:17.359]  One of the things that changed in the policy right around the 50s was something called the Kinross incident because they started to see the UFOs merge together on radar and take off before they had never seen that.
[01:42:17.359 --> 01:42:19.760]  So it went into a whole different level of classification.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:25.659]  And it's very interesting because that level of classification Created a group called XProtect.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:32.420]  They are the ones who have designed the misinformation programs and stonewalled the public for 70 years on this.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:43.539]  But what's interesting is they changed their tune in the last five to six years, and they wanna create a false, they wanna kind of co-opt the idea that people have gotten too good in terms of UFO research.
[01:42:43.829 --> 01:42:50.329]  In terms of the general public mentality, they know enough about it that they figured, okay, we'll co-opt their interest.
[01:42:50.609 --> 01:42:58.710]  UFOs were the top choice, the top search in Google in 2016. So they figured, okay, we'd better roll out our program.
[01:42:58.829 --> 01:43:02.609]  And they had originally planned for Clinton to be in to roll out that program.
[01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:07.810]  That's why she was talking all about UAP in 2016, pretty far in advance of anyone.
[01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:15.470]  And she was around all those people like Tom DeLonge and Podesta who were all working together to launch this false UFO threat operation.
[01:43:15.609 --> 01:43:17.189]  That's all intelligence community stuff.
[01:43:17.329 --> 01:43:22.289]  It has nothing to do with the genuine UFO file, which by the way, definitely exists.
[01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:28.210]  And searching for the origins of that are a lot deeper than what we have in our own intelligence community about this.
[01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:32.109]  But they've been able to back engineer the technology.
[01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:40.170]  We've had enough physicists go on record and have their careers destroyed or even lethal consequences in relationship to this.
[01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:49.189]  Talking about the fact that we re-engineered it and that was a program and that they had different physicists in charge since the 1940s controlling the UFO file.
[01:43:49.619 --> 01:43:57.319]  But the ultimate thing about the UFO file goes back to people like von Braun and others who said it was going to be used as the ultimate wild card.
[01:43:57.539 --> 01:44:03.119]  It was going to be an alien threat takeover, and they were going to use that as an excuse for emergency powers.
[01:44:03.319 --> 01:44:07.699]  Well, he made that prediction back in 1975 privately to his aid.
[01:44:07.859 --> 01:44:26.229]  But everything that he said in relation to that, and of course, When Braun was as deep inside the NASA file as you can get, brought over here from the advanced German program and then brought into our space program and then ultimately breaking off of NASA and helping to incorporate the secret space program.
[01:44:26.579 --> 01:44:29.939]  He knew, and he also was worried about it, which is interesting.
[01:44:30.239 --> 01:44:37.039]  Maybe he had an attack of conscience at the end of his life, but he said what they're going to do at the end is pull out the alien threat card.
[01:44:37.199 --> 01:44:42.920]  And the thing is, all these different scenarios that they use for emergency powers are not going to be real.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:45.619]  And then we've got John.
[01:44:45.859 --> 01:44:48.640]  I mean, look at this footage from 1953. I mean, that's real footage.
[01:44:48.819 --> 01:44:49.239]  I mean, look at that.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:51.939]  Yeah, that's incredible.
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:58.640]  That is the drone swarm and it's interesting because that's the UFO swarm right there.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:06.060]  And what they're doing with the drones is reenacting this idea and putting it over people who, we understand that it's drone technology.
[01:45:06.449 --> 01:45:17.710]  But the genuine UFOs and the way that they act and they operate, there is crossover because if you look at some of the stories out of New Jersey, you will see people saying, I missed time when these things showed up.
[01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:24.489]  There was a couple who came forward and were talking to a news station there, and they said, suddenly we had all this electronic failure.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:31.520]  So there's an effect outside of the development process of the UFO file when they re-engineer it.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:40.100]  And I call the effect apotheum, and it creates a reality distortion effect, which is one of the reasons for the high level of secrecy around this stuff.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:48.560]  When they get around it and they say, well, torsion physics makes nuclear explosions look like a firecracker.
[01:45:48.699 --> 01:45:50.119]  This is the nature of the technology.
[01:45:50.399 --> 01:45:52.600]  That type of physics warps reality.
[01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:57.180]  And that's why when you have around the UFO file, you have a number of unusual things.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:59.579]  When people are abducted, they go through things.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.739]  They disappear out of their car and then are placed back in their car.
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.500]  Eight hours go by and they don't know where they've been.
[01:46:05.979 --> 01:46:08.880]  All those types of things are all reality distortion effects.
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:14.199]  That's why they have to get such highly trained individuals to even work with the things that they recover.
[01:46:14.479 --> 01:46:28.829]  So now I think what they're trying to do, and I think one of the craft that they redeveloped, I actually put it in my X thread, which is the Calvin UFO, which is a photo that they suppressed from 1990. And they finally let this thing out.
[01:46:28.930 --> 01:46:35.970]  But I think that it shows their version of trying to control these massive ships and the way that they're trying to do it.
[01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:41.649]  And they want to make sure they can do it without this apotheum effect overflowing and creating all these physics disturbances.
[01:46:41.649 --> 01:46:50.789]  Because what happens is, whenever you see a UFO showing up in these various areas, you get blackouts, you get people missing time, you get things disappearing, you get animals disappearing.
[01:46:51.069 --> 01:46:52.829]  I mean, all these unusual things show up.
[01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:58.289]  And then if one of these craft ever land, one of the odd effects that takes place is nothing ever grows there again.
[01:46:58.869 --> 01:47:03.989]  So we have to realize that we're looking at a totally different level of technology to start with.
[01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:15.130]  So when they're mimicking it, or if they're rolling out certain aspects of the UFO technology through the drones, then it gets highly suspicious and highly dangerous for the testing aspect.
[01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:31.270]  And if they go from the test into a full live situation, We're looking at a dangerous period because you have an administration that's outgoing and you have a president-elect coming in, but there's a void of power right in there where this third force, this extraterritorial group,
[01:47:31.449 --> 01:47:37.689]  not extraterrestrial, extraterritorial, they can come in and they have the ability then to call emergency powers in.
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:44.479]  And what that does is gets them around all the constitutional problems and also the ability to govern.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.020]  Because one of the things that the problems that they have with governing is they can't keep their own popularity levels up high enough to govern.
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.579]  So they need emergency powers.
[01:47:52.779 --> 01:48:00.380]  That's why you see guys like Macron in France when he wants to get things done through the legislature is just like, I'm gonna change the age around retirement.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:01.180]  Daniel, stay there.
[01:48:01.279 --> 01:48:01.880]  We gotta go to break.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:03.020]  Yeah.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.159]  Unbelievably important.
[01:48:04.359 --> 01:48:06.180]  And again, it's not like we're just saying this.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.079]  You've been saying this for decades.
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:07.880]  I've been saying it for decades.
[01:48:08.039 --> 01:48:08.979]  It's in the documents.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:09.500]  It's leaked.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.500]  That, oh, if the world ever rises up against our global government, we'll just do the fake invasion.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.079]  We've said that's always one of the main things of Bluebeam.
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:18.239]  And it's happening just like we said.
[01:48:18.899 --> 01:48:19.300]  Absolutely.
[01:48:19.579 --> 01:48:21.619]  I mean, this is a historic time, folks.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.319]  It's the quickening.
[01:48:22.579 --> 01:48:23.619]  I'm getting chills.
[01:48:23.819 --> 01:48:25.140]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:48:25.819 --> 01:48:28.819]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.159]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:35.449]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:48:35.890 --> 01:48:39.029]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:48:39.409 --> 01:48:42.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:48:42.210 --> 01:48:44.050]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:50.550]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:48:50.789 --> 01:48:53.829]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:55.250]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:56.350]  We're going to get behind.
[01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:59.770]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:48:59.949 --> 01:49:01.529]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:31.800]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border again by design and so much more is happening this is an exciting time but the globalists are striking back that's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever and we can't do it without you so we make it easy go to thealexshonestore.com and get the most amazing widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word to meet like-minded people and support the info war now The folks at Bigly that power
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.760]  the AlexJoStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.399]  And I personally love this one.

[01:49:48.199 --> 01:49:49.659]  And this will horrify.
[01:49:50.289 --> 01:49:54.750]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fear when you're walking on the street.
[01:49:54.789 --> 01:49:55.430]  Say, it's okay.
[01:49:55.829 --> 01:50:00.529]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:50:00.949 --> 01:50:07.130]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.

[01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:39.430]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:41.409]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:52:07.439 --> 01:52:09.680]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:52:09.899 --> 01:52:12.159]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with the fight.
[01:52:12.359 --> 01:52:13.399]  God bless and good luck.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:15.039]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:52:16.039 --> 01:52:17.939]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:21.000]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:52:21.359 --> 01:52:24.739]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:29.109]  All right, dark journalist Daniel List just laid some major information.
[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:32.850]  He's written for some of the top publications, like the Wall Street Journal here in the United States.
[01:52:32.850 --> 01:52:36.350]  He is an amazing researcher and author, and he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:37.449]  He told me what's coming up.
[01:52:37.689 --> 01:52:47.909]  Some stations don't carry this little five minutes, but he's going to give you huge NORTHCOM, Space Command, globalist information, because they always foreshadow what they're going to do.
[01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:49.069]  When he just told me, I didn't know about it.
[01:52:49.090 --> 01:52:49.470]  We looked it up.
[01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.890]  It's there.
[01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.989]  It's stunning.
[01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:57.869]  That they've been preparing current, months ago, drills for right now and coming up for what's happening.
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:59.270]  This is unbelievable.
[01:52:59.850 --> 01:53:00.550]  But it's not.
[01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:01.130]  They always do it.
[01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:02.250]  It's wild.
[01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:14.829]  But you were going to get directly in this short segment into this particular famous UFO from the UK, and then you guys were able to re-engineer this, so you're quite the expert on it.
[01:53:16.029 --> 01:53:17.090]  Tell us about this.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:18.760]  This is incredible.
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:26.880]  So this was a shot taken by a witness of a craft that was, as you can see, about four times larger than a plane.
[01:53:27.399 --> 01:53:32.039]  And it was accompanied and it was moving at incredible speeds and the plane was trying to keep up with it.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:38.739]  What they did was they suppressed this picture from 1990, and it went underground for 30 years.
[01:53:38.739 --> 01:53:51.680]  It got re-released in 2022, and it's one of the best photos of a plane either accompanying or chasing UFO. What I got into detail about it, and I got the negative of this picture, by the way, it's very interesting.
[01:53:52.159 --> 01:54:04.920]  But what I got and what I heard about the witnesses and the story behind it is that this was actually a test, the Calvin UFO. And what they were doing is we had this craft and it was in pretty good shape.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:07.979]  And they decided to try and fly it and they had problems with it.
[01:54:08.079 --> 01:54:09.899]  And you see a plane accompanying it.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.220]  It's not actually chasing it.
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:23.340]  It's keeping up with it and trying to Sort of guide it as it goes along because what they've had trouble with from this whole period is when they've redeveloped the craft, it has this apotheum effect, which is highly unpredictable.
[01:54:23.939 --> 01:54:38.000]  And so when we get into those situations where we're redeveloping it, sometimes they have to show it publicly, which is what I think the Phoenix lights was in 1997. Part of the technology that they need to roll out is, we call it the breakaway tech.
[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:39.359]  This is the nature of the thing.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:42.539]  It's X technology inside the UFO file.
[01:54:42.789 --> 01:54:50.789]  So, for example, the things that Tesla developed and there were other things that Einstein developed and others were referred to.
[01:54:50.989 --> 01:54:58.829]  A lot of this is referred to later if you look at people like President Trump when he was giving briefings when he was president in his first term.
[01:54:58.989 --> 01:55:02.750]  He would say, we have planes that can go invisible.
[01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:05.369]  And then they would say, no, no, that's not true.
[01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:06.430]  He didn't mean that, whatever.
[01:55:06.649 --> 01:55:07.470]  No, he did.
[01:55:07.909 --> 01:55:09.350]  They do have invisibility.
[01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:11.609]  And this is the nature of using that technology.
[01:55:11.829 --> 01:55:15.829]  So that part was developed early on in Einstein and Tesla.
[01:55:16.029 --> 01:55:17.470]  Both of them were involved in it.
[01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:20.789]  They used the Tesla technology and Einstein was, of course, deep inside that.
[01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:25.550]  The invisibility technology is interesting because you see things about the drones disappearing.
[01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:27.949]  So I believe that it's a test of that.
[01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:31.770]  They say the F-15s have invisibility technology on board.
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:33.220]  But it's unstable.
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:35.100]  It's not fully worked out on our side.
[01:55:35.279 --> 01:55:48.880]  There was a guy who came forward, Colonel Philip Corso, who said that the things that we developed on the inside, which were some of the fastest manned space planes, were all about chasing UFOs.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.760]  So X-15s and these planes were all developed for that specific purpose.
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:55.140]  And it's very interesting.
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:56:13.289]  If you go back and look at it in the history side of it, Gorbachev, actually the former leader of the Soviet Union, came here to New York and that was in 2013. And he talked all about how Reagan took him aside during their meeting in Reykjavik and said,
[01:56:13.369 --> 01:56:18.890]  we need to create and develop this whole SDI block against this UFO threat.
[01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:20.810]  Will you help us if they attack us?
[01:56:21.029 --> 01:56:22.510]  And then he went on record with that.
[01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:24.409]  Everyone in the room was freaked out when he said it.
[01:56:24.689 --> 01:56:26.729]  But it's on record, and we know that it's true.
[01:56:27.010 --> 01:56:27.590]  All right, stay there.
[01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:29.930]  We gotta go to the 60-second break, rejoin a bunch of stations.
[01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:33.029]  I've got so much to talk about here.
[01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:37.369]  We're gonna get into this latest COG operations.
[01:56:37.529 --> 01:56:37.869]  Stay with us.
[01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:41.550]  Daniel List, known as Dark Journalist of darkjournalist.com, is our guest.
[01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:54.069]  One of the, I think, most insightful people out there that has a wide-ranging compendium understanding of it, and is also an expert on every facet.
[01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:59.520]  I've been studying this for 40 years, and he knows way more than I do, and we're very honored to have him.
[01:56:59.619 --> 01:57:03.560]  He's going to be guest hosting some, or at least two hours next week.
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.939]  Very excited about that because I really want to give him the floor here.
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:10.359]  I've got a lot of my questions here, but I didn't even know, and I looked it up when he said it.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.000]  Obviously, it's true.
[01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:16.390]  That the head of NORTHCOM, that's really the COG, shadow government, command system of everything.
[01:57:16.489 --> 01:57:22.989]  That's admitted, by the way, the alternate backup government for nuclear war was the cover for really building the system for the breakaway civilization.
[01:57:23.369 --> 01:57:36.989]  That they're having drills and preparing drills months ago for what's now happening, drone swarm versus UAV. And then Elon's saying, we will be confronted by drone swarms.
[01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:38.970]  You'll be blown away by that you won't even believe.
[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:40.750]  And then we'll get into...
[01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:50.970]  How far he thinks this is going to go and what the different scenarios are from what he's reverse engineered and what they've admitted and leaked or pre-programmed us with.
[01:57:51.109 --> 01:58:01.949]  And then why would Wernher von Braun come out with a book about Mars and predict a Mars base and all this and then call the governor of it or the ruler of it, Elon?
[01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:05.630]  And we'll look at the date when he wrote the book versus when Elon was born.
[01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:07.829]  I mean, there's definitely a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:10.189]  So, Dark Journalists, there's a lot to cover this hour.
[01:58:10.289 --> 01:58:10.729]  Please continue.
[01:58:12.730 --> 01:58:13.170]  Absolutely.
[01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:13.789]  Yeah.
[01:58:14.050 --> 01:58:18.390]  And well, you set it up really well there because there's a number of different factors involved.
[01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:20.050]  You're not just talking about hardware.
[01:58:20.329 --> 01:58:22.090]  You're not just talking about technical things.
[01:58:22.289 --> 01:58:22.550]  You're right.
[01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:25.989]  There's a other backdrop deep in the middle of all this.
[01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:29.329]  And that is kind of like a mystical side to it.
[01:58:29.449 --> 01:58:36.430]  But what I will say this in relation to the Homeland Synchronizer op.
[01:58:36.569 --> 01:58:40.630]  This is an operation that is taking place and it took place in November.
[01:58:41.210 --> 01:58:46.789]  And it was done by General Gregory Guillo, who was the NORTHCOM commander and the COG NORAD commander.
[01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:59.630]  This guy did an incredible series of And what happened was they tested out drone swarms versus UAP and what would happen in the midst of all that.
[01:58:59.810 --> 01:59:02.409]  They were testing that November 28th, okay?
[01:59:02.670 --> 01:59:08.210]  Then you get a couple of weeks into this and we're getting all these drone swarms right on the heels of it.
[01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:14.289]  November 28th, the COG commander goes and writes an article for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:17.930]  And in the article, it states the US homeland is not defended.
[01:59:18.369 --> 01:59:24.430]  It goes into a whole spiel about how we need to defend against these unmanned drone systems.
[01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:30.449]  Now, this was the same, that commander, Van Herc, who's retired now, and it's Geo is the active one.
[01:59:30.670 --> 01:59:38.029]  But Van Herc is interesting because in 2023, when he was the COG commander, they had the Chinese balloon piece.
[01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:41.750]  And when they were doing the Chinese balloon piece, they asked him, do you think it's extraterrestrial?
[01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:43.430]  And he said, it could be anything.
[01:59:43.789 --> 01:59:48.489]  And they ran away with the headline right there that said, it's extraterrestrial.
[01:59:48.689 --> 01:59:55.029]  The whole thing that we're seeing over Canada, these other sightings and all the balloons, they're actually ET and we're shooting them down.
[01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:57.850]  So there's weird UFO shoot down headlines.
[01:59:58.149 --> 02:00:01.409]  This was the threat narrative that was being built up in the background.
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.539]  It's sort of like a subconscious layer.
[02:00:04.079 --> 02:00:07.140]  They didn't freak out about it, but they put it out there enough.
[02:00:07.239 --> 02:00:09.380]  And they didn't have Biden or the defense secretary.
[02:00:09.619 --> 02:00:11.140]  They had the COG commander.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:13.199]  Well, I can tell you this is an interesting thing.
[02:00:13.359 --> 02:00:16.479]  Those guys usually stay way, way in the background.
[02:00:16.659 --> 02:00:23.840]  As a matter of fact, you couldn't even mention COG in Congress if you were bringing things up in the 80s and 90s, nearly 2000s.
[02:00:24.199 --> 02:00:34.359]  The rules got changed around COG in 2007. That's when they started to incorporate the aspects of drones, UAP, and UFOs.
[02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:35.840]  That's the key change.
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:42.340]  And the person in the middle of all that was Dick Cheney, who'd been a part of the original setup of COG back in the 1980s.
[02:00:42.529 --> 02:00:58.489]  When you saw Liz Cheney out there railing hard against Trump, it seemed unusual even for the never Trumpers, for someone to be that hardcore and then to actually join the other team and try to railroad Trump and actually get him out of office.
[02:00:58.869 --> 02:01:05.069]  Now, it's interesting because what happened is that Cheney, Liz Cheney, represents that COG branch in the public.
[02:01:05.250 --> 02:01:06.189]  This is where they stand.
[02:01:06.409 --> 02:01:09.250]  They didn't want Trump to get in there under any circumstances.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.260]  So now they have a window, and that window operates between here and January 20th when he gets in.
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:21.439]  And we're seeing things that call into question the entire emergency powers doctrine of the United States.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:33.960]  That emergency powers doctrine states, and it's not constitutional and it's not legal, but it says what would happen in the case of an emergency, which are the same rules that were crafted in 2007 under Bush second.
[02:01:35.339 --> 02:01:39.699]  Those rules state that they can take over the United States and set up regional governors.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.840]  That's the nature of the problem with that.
[02:01:42.039 --> 02:01:45.000]  The original COG doctrine was just for a nuclear war.
[02:01:45.199 --> 02:01:46.180]  They changed it.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:48.819]  And that's where the nature of the problem is.
[02:01:49.039 --> 02:02:03.319]  The UFO emergency, the UFO threat aspect that the intelligence agencies have pushed, CIA, NGA, NSA, they've been pushing it since 2017. Remember, before they used to suppress all this stuff and say it didn't exist.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.220]  Well, they can turn it on and turn it off, apparently, just like we had John Kirby at the Pentagon saying, none of this.
[02:02:10.279 --> 02:02:10.880]  There are no drones.
[02:02:10.979 --> 02:02:13.640]  Those are just planes people are seeing, and they're operated lawfully.
[02:02:13.899 --> 02:02:19.380]  And by the way, since you raised that, I was telling the crew, literally, as you said that, hey, get that clip of Kirby ready for a few days ago.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:27.420]  But for people that missed what you just said, I want to slow down and repeat it and elaborate, because what you said is just, I'm godsmacked.
[02:02:27.479 --> 02:02:30.960]  It's hiding in plain view, and I'm aware of everything you're saying and the drills and all that.
[02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:48.729]  You've got Kirby saying everything's fine, there's nothing, but you've got the head of Northcom and the previous head saying, no, this is imminent, and we don't know what it is, and oh, we've got to get ready, because that triggers under the new COG laws that they got in 2007, not just a nuclear threat to activate,
[02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:55.109]  but if we don't know and there's these unknown things, now the shadow government takes over right before Trump dies.
[02:02:55.130 --> 02:03:01.529]  And he may never even know they've activated all this stuff and what it really means that it now walls it off from him.
[02:03:01.710 --> 02:03:02.649]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:04.109]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:06.689]  And that gets right into the detail of it.
[02:03:06.810 --> 02:03:11.069]  What it is in the heart of this program really is how do you activate emergency powers?
[02:03:11.289 --> 02:03:14.289]  Which is, what are the actual protocols for doing it?
[02:03:14.409 --> 02:03:17.430]  What's the level of threat that you need to actually replace the president?
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:25.819]  And it's very clear if you look at the continuity of government profile and in their deep details, what they did is they changed.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:33.699]  In the 1980s, they started a change, and that was involved with Rumsfeld when he was the CEO of a chemical company, a pharmaceutical company.
[02:03:33.899 --> 02:03:42.359]  And Cheney was in there, and it was unusual because the COG thing kind of went underground a little bit during the Clinton era because they had a lot of shifting around to do.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:46.920]  As soon as they got Bush and 9-11, they activated COG during 9-11.
[02:03:47.159 --> 02:04:02.439]  And we had some unusual things and some unusual crossover with the assassination attempt on Trump because the Secret Service leader at that point was the same woman who had dragged Dick Cheney into the COG bunker during 9-11.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.300]  Well, I don't mention Cheney as just kind of a punchline.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:12.159]  He was deeply involved with crafting the continuity of government protocols in 2007 before they left.
[02:04:12.319 --> 02:04:14.479]  And he was a protégé of Lemnitz, sir.
[02:04:15.119 --> 02:04:19.979]  Who got fired by Kennedy for trying to do a COG. Yes, absolutely.
[02:04:20.279 --> 02:04:28.000]  And that's where, when you get that whole Operation Northwoods thing, you really put Operation Northwoods on the radar.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:37.439]  And it's very interesting because Operation Northwoods tumbled out of these JFK assassination documents late in the 1990s, 30, 40 years after the assassination.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:40.079]  So we only got that piece that much later.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:55.279]  We know that the National Reconnaissance Office was set up In the 1961 under the Kennedy administration, we didn't get to know about the NRO until 1994. That's a 30-year lag time for the secret black program inside the government.
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:59.500]  Well, the government programs that we have around the UFO file exist.
[02:04:59.899 --> 02:05:02.859]  That's where the whole idea of the secret space program comes from.
[02:05:03.039 --> 02:05:21.979]  There's been a lot of disinformation about that, but the real thing, the hardcore thing, Is when we had the NASA hacker go in, Gary McKinnon, and when he saw in NASA's files that they had an off-world officers list, that's a whole different aspect and a whole different infrastructure for space that's not on the record anywhere.
[02:05:22.239 --> 02:05:24.239]  We don't know anything about off-world officers.
[02:05:24.239 --> 02:05:32.680]  We know about the Artemis program and there's different astronauts who supposedly were going back to the moon, maybe.
[02:05:34.119 --> 02:05:38.760]  But they've been talking about that for a long time and they've just seemed to hold it up and hold it up and hold it up.
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:45.539]  What's interesting is NASA has taken a backseat And NASA was the hardcore center of this whole thing.
[02:05:45.699 --> 02:05:49.060]  So they came out and issued their own UFO report last summer.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:50.399]  And they said, you know what?
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:59.579]  A lot of the things that came out, like the flare video and all these things under the intelligence community hearings on UFOs, that the videos weren't accurate.
[02:05:59.579 --> 02:06:03.640]  And that the things that they said were going super fast were actually going at normal speeds.
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:10.500]  So you see an intra-agency battle between NASA and the NGA and the CIA on that whole aspect around UFOs.
[02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.949]  These videos that were, quote unquote, leaked.
[02:06:13.449 --> 02:06:20.689]  Then in the middle of all that, they said, well, we have these 40 or 50 UFO whistleblowers right in the heart of this situation, and we're going to roll them out.
[02:06:20.930 --> 02:06:24.130]  Well, as soon as they said that, all these odd things started to happen.
[02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:41.159]  Like you got these whistleblowers who were like, oh yeah, I'm a CIA agent, I'm an NGA agent, and I'm going to tell you all about the UFO file, which would I think we're good to go.
[02:06:53.310 --> 02:07:01.270]  Of a panic going, can they get enough information and detail to be able to call in a UFO threat and get actual emergency powers going?
[02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:09.229]  Now, Bluebeam has always been the street legend around that, which is they would call it in, they would fake an alien invasion and take over.
[02:07:09.449 --> 02:07:20.949]  But it was based on a fundamental concept that they had deep inside that shadowy corridor between the aerospace aspect of the intelligence community and the military industrial complex.
[02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:23.229]  It was just hanging out there in the middle.
[02:07:23.649 --> 02:07:33.130]  And it goes back to the fact that they took the UFO file out of the hands of the regular government and moved it into these semi-corporate intelligence hands.
[02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:36.090]  And once they did that, it became harder and harder to do.
[02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:41.510]  You saw presidents like Trump trying to get the Space Force to get that UFO file back under executive control.
[02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:43.729]  And it's interesting.
[02:07:44.090 --> 02:07:49.930]  I've made this point before about Trump and his background and Kennedy and his background.
[02:07:50.250 --> 02:07:54.310]  Both their families are deep, deep in the UFO file.
[02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:55.630]  There's no question about it.
[02:07:55.770 --> 02:07:56.649]  It's on record.
[02:07:56.810 --> 02:08:00.989]  So I'm not suggesting that Trump is some UFO wizard with all the tech in the world.
[02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:16.029]  But the fact that the Defense Department and people in that deep state operation and deep aerospace, which is something that doesn't get talked about enough, When they sit down across the table from Trump and they know that his uncle is John Trump and that he's been shared,
[02:08:16.329 --> 02:08:25.109]  these things have been shared with him, and that Roy Cohn was in deep aerospace, then I think that's where the nature of the problems with Trump really come from.
[02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:28.109]  His political aspects.
[02:08:28.529 --> 02:08:34.390]  And so Trump has been very cagey in public about the UFO file, but he's been more and more open about it.
[02:08:34.489 --> 02:08:36.189]  He's been talking about it more.
[02:08:36.369 --> 02:08:46.170]  And I think in the case of Trump and Kennedy, if they're saying transparency, of course, deep in the heart of the things that they want to release is having a more transparent government.
[02:08:46.170 --> 02:08:48.270]  Well, the UFO file is the biggest secret.
[02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:54.170]  Remember, it's physicist Robert Sarbacher who said it's a higher national security secret than the atomic bomb.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:56.060]  And all the nuclear secrecy.
[02:08:56.159 --> 02:08:57.899]  So the UFO file is the top.
[02:08:58.159 --> 02:09:06.260]  And the reason I believe it's the top is because of this torsion physics aspect involved in that apotheum effect which just distorts reality.
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.899]  And they're not always sure where they can aim this thing.
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.359]  So I think when we're seeing the drone swarms and things of this nature, what you're getting is a public read.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:22.350]  They're looking to see what would happen if And there are guys like Kirby, I think, coming up to the podium and giving just a flat response.
[02:09:22.569 --> 02:09:32.510]  And one of the responses that he gives is exactly what we heard in 1952. If you go back and watch those, they say, well, there are these things out there, but they don't seem to pose any threat.
[02:09:32.989 --> 02:09:34.630]  Which is absolutely absurd.
[02:09:34.949 --> 02:09:37.689]  And in his case, he said they were operating lawfully.
[02:09:37.989 --> 02:09:41.189]  So I hope that sort of zips everybody up on that.
[02:09:41.369 --> 02:09:46.270]  Well, then the Senator Kim from New Jersey came out and said, no, I've been watching this stuff.
[02:09:46.409 --> 02:09:47.529]  I watch it from my backyard.
[02:09:47.529 --> 02:09:51.250]  I live in New Jersey, and I'm the senator, and this stuff is all over the place.
[02:09:51.449 --> 02:09:58.010]  So I've heard from a number of residents in New York and New Jersey that are seeing drones all over the place.
[02:09:58.329 --> 02:10:00.329]  So this is highly unusual activity.
[02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:01.649]  There's no question about it.
[02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:02.350]  It's undeniable.
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:04.279]  Wow.
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.939]  Let's play one of the recent Kirby clips since you've been raising it.
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:09.359]  Here it is.
[02:10:10.979 --> 02:10:18.439]  Now, finally, I just want to add a few comments on the reports of drone activity here on the East Coast, particularly in and around New Jersey.
[02:10:19.279 --> 02:10:26.279]  We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat.
[02:10:26.890 --> 02:10:29.369]  Or have a foreign nexus.
[02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:41.710]  The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they're working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.
[02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:57.329]  Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, We have not been able to, and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities, corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.
[02:10:57.489 --> 02:11:06.369]  To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.
[02:11:07.069 --> 02:11:15.689]  The United States Coast Guard is providing support to the state of New Jersey and has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels.
[02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:22.189]  And importantly, there are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace.
[02:11:22.899 --> 02:11:39.960]  That said, we certainly take seriously the threat that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems, which is why law enforcement and other agencies continue to support New Jersey and investigate the reports, even though they have uncovered no malicious activity or intent at this particular stage.
[02:11:40.199 --> 02:11:46.819]  While there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.
[02:11:47.250 --> 02:12:07.470]  And so we urge Congress to pass important legislation that will extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities so that we are better prepared to identify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:11.159]  Alright, so let's take it from the end with my comments and then yours, Daniel.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.720]  At the end, oh, it's not a threat.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:14.859]  We know what it is.
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:22.960]  But there is a threat and we do need a new government agency that controls all this and new funding and control and we're the boss and all the information goes through that.
[02:12:23.479 --> 02:12:27.100]  Then he says most of this is obviously other commercial aircraft.
[02:12:27.279 --> 02:12:28.539]  Well, yeah, people start looking up.
[02:12:28.699 --> 02:12:29.880]  They start seeing things.
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:34.140]  That part is true.
[02:12:34.739 --> 02:12:50.449]  But To then just claim that everything is fine when there are clearly crafts, like we're going to play with audio right now, this was over in New Jersey a few days ago, that sound like they have jet engines, but do things that no known aircraft do,
[02:12:50.689 --> 02:12:55.949]  that they go up and get in position, is it an anti-missile defense system or something like that?
[02:12:55.949 --> 02:13:03.500]  This is what people are seeing, and this isn't normal, and Wheels within wheels flying around right above people's houses.
[02:13:03.699 --> 02:13:04.939]  It looks like nothing we've ever seen.
[02:13:05.399 --> 02:13:11.920]  Very, very novel other than an ancient text from the Sumerians and others.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.479]  Let's go ahead and roll this with audio.
[02:13:13.479 --> 02:13:14.039]  Here it is.
[02:13:28.699 --> 02:13:36.960]  Now you hear the cars making a noise too, but if you listen carefully, I turn this weight up with headphones, it appears you can also hear when they first are thrusting up, you hear something, then not later.
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:54.000]  I mean, maybe it's another propulsion system, but the point is, that is very advanced, and those are big at a distance, and they're obviously communicating with each other, or have been pre-programmed, and this is what we're seeing all over the world right now, and there's a massive increase in all of this,
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:14:04.109]  but for Kirby, And of course, my biggest takeaway from Kirby, the psyopers that write that for him, is the biggest takeaway is they know they're discredited.
[02:14:04.210 --> 02:14:05.510]  They know people always believe the opposite.
[02:14:05.770 --> 02:14:11.550]  You couldn't tailor a statement better by them to make people not believe them and be scared, in my view.
[02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:13.649]  Excellent point.
[02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:16.710]  Yeah, and you've tuned into something very interesting that he did there.
[02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:19.130]  There's a lot of dancing in his statements.
[02:14:19.579 --> 02:14:25.380]  Because at one hand, he's saying, it's absolutely lawful, it's just planes, basically forget about it.
[02:14:25.479 --> 02:14:34.600]  And then he's like, but we know there's a secret threat going on in relation to UAP and these drone swarms, and we need more authority in relation to that.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:38.859]  So he does a very interesting side dance there, I think, as well.
[02:14:39.079 --> 02:14:42.600]  There's a lot of messaging, no question, that goes on with this.
[02:14:42.859 --> 02:14:54.840]  And I think the messaging that's very clear, one, is that we're in this midway point, and the groups that hold that technology are not satisfied with the idea of the incoming administration.
[02:14:55.529 --> 02:14:56.470]  That's for sure.
[02:14:56.649 --> 02:15:03.050]  So you have a very dangerous period, I think, between here and anything that happens between here and the inauguration, there's no question about it.
[02:15:03.170 --> 02:15:13.369]  Because their only chance, and there are always extreme groups sitting inside that kind of expert tech structure, their only chance of maintaining power really is emergency powers.
[02:15:13.590 --> 02:15:22.529]  So the question is, do they get enough feedback from the drone swarms and others to say, we can wield this power and we have the ability to do this?
[02:15:22.729 --> 02:15:26.149]  This is interesting, too, because they're questioning the entire structure.
[02:15:26.350 --> 02:15:29.729]  They've said before they don't really believe in regular democracy.
[02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:34.229]  And they've shown it, I think, over the past 10 years in particular.
[02:15:34.529 --> 02:15:37.850]  So what we're looking at, I think, with the UFO file is this.
[02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:45.850]  The drone swarms are an opening because they have developed all this technology over the past 80 years on the breakaway side.
[02:15:46.050 --> 02:15:50.489]  And now they have to break back in with the technology and they need a story that goes with it.
[02:15:50.649 --> 02:15:56.010]  Well, the story is, you know, we've been tracking this threat that's out there.
[02:15:56.109 --> 02:16:02.069]  Now we have this advanced stuff that's going to fight with the threat and protect you ultimately with the UFO Defense Office.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:03.060]  Exactly.
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:05.140]  Whatever this imaginary thing is, don't worry.
[02:16:05.239 --> 02:16:06.300]  We've got something to counter it.
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:07.699]  And that's not just your opinion.
[02:16:08.119 --> 02:16:08.619]  Explain this.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:15.199]  The reason we know so much about the globalists is they always have secret programs for 30, 40, 50 years.
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:18.180]  Then they roll out a limited version saying it's the latest.
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:23.119]  They've already compartmentalized and made secret all the new stuff that they have developed.
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:25.399]  Then they'll give the technology to other countries and people.
[02:16:25.579 --> 02:16:30.520]  So they always have to have new technology to counter that threat in a kind of technological arms race.
[02:16:30.659 --> 02:16:46.739]  But from the evidence I've seen, We're always thinking there's only one more level above what they already have, but there's obviously a lot more levels depending on the area of research, but that's how we understand them so much is because they follow neurotically formulas in all of what they do.
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:49.659]  That's an excellent point.
[02:16:49.819 --> 02:16:55.280]  We get different types of levels of lying as you get along in this process.
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:04.879]  And it's very interesting because I recall interviewing a documentary filmmaker who had made a documentary film for Nixon's administration.
[02:17:04.879 --> 02:17:06.479]  That's how far back this guy went.
[02:17:06.729 --> 02:17:11.030]  And while he was studying that, in 1973, they let him into the Pentagon.
[02:17:11.309 --> 02:17:14.170]  And what he saw were all of these different troops.
[02:17:14.350 --> 02:17:19.129]  They had electrodes and things tied up to their head, and they had the 1970s TVs in front of them.
[02:17:19.290 --> 02:17:25.290]  And they could think things, like look at a castle, think of a castle, and then a castle would appear on the screen.
[02:17:25.530 --> 02:17:28.430]  So this is the nature of the technology back then.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:36.879]  So now they have the technology not only that can listen to your conversations and dime into your video and all that kind of stuff, they can actually read your thoughts.
[02:17:37.959 --> 02:17:42.879]  And so in terms of technology, they've gone so far beyond it.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:46.520]  I uncovered information about a project, and this is how obsessed...
[02:17:47.309 --> 02:18:03.190]  If we think about the deep state and how obsessed they are with having that advantage in terms of information, they had studied a group of people thinking that these people had reincarnated during a period of time when there was advanced technology in our ancient past.
[02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:13.690]  And they wanted to get from their unconscious minds memories of their past lives and study their past lives to figure out what the technology that was operational then.
[02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:30.739]  So when you're talking about- And they also study whether maybe it wasn't Classical Hindu reincarnation model of understanding what people are experiencing, but that it's a deeper epigenetic instincts that actually the cells, depending on the people and the time and when they had the children and what was going on,
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:35.020]  express those genetic memories that can also be trolled.
[02:18:35.779 --> 02:18:36.299]  Absolutely.
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.100]  It's subconscious memory.
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:48.420]  And that's a very interesting thing because when we get into things like we're talking about Atlantis, etc., the nature of the technology fundamentally was mystical.
[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:53.379]  You had to have the ability on a psychic level, on an astral level, to operate it.
[02:18:53.479 --> 02:19:04.200]  And that's the thing that they went in and did these recruiting programs during the remote viewing project and others, where they said, and for NASA as well, where they said, we need to recruit psychics for this.
[02:19:05.039 --> 02:19:07.879]  Well, that's what they figured out when they were redeveloping this.
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:10.440]  Sending in a straight pilot for this didn't do anything.
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.479]  They needed somebody with extra abilities.
[02:19:12.739 --> 02:19:17.739]  And that's where we get the stories from people like Russell Tarr, who ran those programs for the government.

[02:21:12.819 --> 02:21:15.920]  Everything's there right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:27.819]  Well, anybody that tells you the world's boring and there's a slow news day.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:29.739]  I've been on air 31 years next April.
[02:21:30.979 --> 02:21:33.120]  There's always too much news, too much information.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:44.959]  But my main mission is to learn as much as I can and to share information with people and to have them share information with me and to build a decentralized, open, free human community.
[02:21:46.739 --> 02:21:52.110]  And I instinctively, spiritually, my programming is like that.
[02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:53.389]  I feel good when I do that.
[02:21:53.590 --> 02:22:01.329]  But I can intellectually, with a lot of knowledge compared to most people, know that the only way we're going to survive is being peaceful.
[02:22:02.819 --> 02:22:07.040]  Now, you can't be, when I say peaceful, I mean peaceful and you don't attack people.
[02:22:07.459 --> 02:22:10.319]  You've got to be strong because there are bad people.
[02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:12.860]  I'm not talking about being some wimp here.
[02:22:13.219 --> 02:22:14.180]  You've got to be strong.
[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:14.920]  You've got to be independent.
[02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:16.600]  You've got to have as much wealth as you can.
[02:22:17.059 --> 02:22:19.620]  You've got to have as many friends as you can.
[02:22:19.719 --> 02:22:24.260]  And you've got to promote freedom and justice because there are people that will fight that.
[02:22:24.989 --> 02:22:27.610]  So good people have to get involved, like Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:22:27.690 --> 02:22:28.530]  How does evil win?
[02:22:28.930 --> 02:22:30.049]  Good men do nothing.
[02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:44.610]  But I never really talk about this because it's private stuff, and it's also just as a rule...
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:48.799]  I don't like to sit here and just try to sound important.
[02:22:49.139 --> 02:22:50.680]  But my point is we're all important.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:23:00.819]  And I can tell you that I've had a big effect on people in government, corporations, academia, technology, because not a lot of people are kind of covering the full field like I do.
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:03.200]  And I've had a lot of guests on.
[02:23:03.319 --> 02:23:05.239]  And I've talked to a lot of people on record and off record.
[02:23:05.319 --> 02:23:08.760]  And I can tell you that I've talked to very important people.
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.120]  And I'm talking about, like, President Trump.
[02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:12.719]  And I'm talking about...
[02:23:13.959 --> 02:23:19.040]  Elon Musk, and I'm talking about, you name it, basically, over the years.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:29.399]  And when I was younger, I didn't realize, A, how dumb or dumbed down or ignorant some of the public was.
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:30.559]  I mean, I just underestimated it.
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:35.340]  But also underestimated how smart people in the power structure are.
[02:23:35.479 --> 02:23:37.059]  And there's a mix of different types.
[02:23:38.450 --> 02:23:40.469]  And there are different factions and groups.
[02:23:41.049 --> 02:23:46.649]  It's more complex than people that talk about the globalists, the New World Order, and just act like it's one big block.
[02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:53.250]  There's society and civilization growing and developing and the different factions that want to control its trajectory.
[02:23:53.670 --> 02:24:01.909]  But I can tell you, and some of this has been public, and some of it hasn't, you know, two and a half hour conversation with Elon on air and other conversations, things like that.
[02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:03.290]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:06.239]  I'm like, we need to be open about all this.
[02:24:06.379 --> 02:24:10.860]  We need to, you know, decentralize technology and accelerate it.
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:17.340]  And we can't let the bad faction control it in the name of keeping everybody safe because it's too dangerous.
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:27.600]  And then they're planning to wipe out the human civilization greedily because it might, you know, the breakaway civilization or civilizations might be challenged by a renaissance.
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:35.450]  That's what tyrants always do to create stagnation And that it always creates wars.
[02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:37.889]  And basically, you hear Elon say that everywhere.
[02:24:38.290 --> 02:24:40.209]  And I'm not saying I taught him that.
[02:24:40.889 --> 02:24:49.129]  It's just that I've been the person, really, of the biggest audience warning of this and saying, we can't just challenge the globalist Malthusian death cult.
[02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:55.409]  We also have to have plan B. And we need to have an open discussion about that.
[02:24:55.649 --> 02:24:59.129]  And I said that about, I don't know, 17 years ago, a lot on the air.
[02:24:59.229 --> 02:25:00.309]  I was really getting into this deeply.
[02:25:01.769 --> 02:25:03.889]  And I got some calls and some things.
[02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:05.190]  People said, we want to meet with you in England.
[02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:06.389]  We need to come here and do this.
[02:25:06.610 --> 02:25:11.110]  I got some other calls and I was just like, I'm not getting involved with intelligence agencies.
[02:25:11.329 --> 02:25:12.170]  I don't do that.
[02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:13.090]  I don't trust you people.
[02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.930]  I'm independent.
[02:25:14.209 --> 02:25:15.569]  I never get involved in these groups.
[02:25:15.850 --> 02:25:22.030]  And it was high level stuff in the UK because what I was talking about, having a plan B and being honest about this, but it definitely hit some nerves.
[02:25:23.139 --> 02:25:39.780]  And then recently I've had some very interesting conversations in just the last 48 hours of people saying, look, you basically decompartmentalized and reverse engineered what we're already trying to do and just keep doing what you're doing and such and such.
[02:25:39.959 --> 02:25:43.440]  And I can see by those people that actually in their actions are promoting this.
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:45.620]  So you look at the tree's fruits, as Christ said.
[02:25:45.819 --> 02:25:48.680]  So I just want people to know there's a lot of epic stuff going on.
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:50.559]  And I feel sorry.
[02:25:50.659 --> 02:25:52.719]  And I don't mean that like, oh, I feel sorry for where I'm superior.
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.239]  I mean, I really feel sorry for my enemies and the globalists and people calling themselves leftists who aren't.
[02:25:58.299 --> 02:26:07.819]  You're just defenders of the worst establishment factions who try to keep people from even knowing about that this stuff's going on and trying to discover more.
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:09.399]  We're all in danger.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.579]  And there's currently the main faction wants to just get rid of almost everybody.
[02:26:14.329 --> 02:26:24.770]  And if you think you're safe in that or you think this post-industrial world they're building, pulling the rug out from under us because they think it's too dangerous to let the general public have any technology, you have a death wish.
[02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:31.909]  To me, there is no way, scientifically, historically, intellectually, spiritually, consciously, any way you look at this...
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:39.299]  This is going to end up blowing the planet up on the current trajectory in the name of security doing this.
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:40.840]  So that plan is war.
[02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:42.200]  Asymmetrical war.
[02:26:42.299 --> 02:26:43.260]  And people are waking up.
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:44.860]  And people are going to oppose it.
[02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:47.079]  And the globalists are never going to get away with this.
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:50.479]  They might kill us all, but that's the best they can do.
[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:52.579]  Like with their World War III crap right now.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:56.879]  So I'm not even really even making a point here.
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:59.299]  I'm just simply bringing people to where I'm at in my mind.
[02:27:00.989 --> 02:27:02.909]  Is team humanity is really cool?
[02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:04.709]  And there are a lot of good people?
[02:27:05.409 --> 02:27:08.090]  And so for everybody that thinks everything's corrupt, no, there's a lot of good people.
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:10.309]  So to that crowd that have just given up, no, you're wrong.
[02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:11.489]  We've got a good chance turning this around.
[02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:18.670]  But for people that are evil or joined evil because they think it makes them powerful, the real power is joining team humanity.
[02:27:19.049 --> 02:27:26.170]  And I don't know why everybody doesn't defect to humanity in an open, free, good society of honesty.
[02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:26.850]  We can do anything.
[02:27:27.129 --> 02:27:29.329]  And there is good in the universe.
[02:27:29.569 --> 02:27:35.370]  It's actually much more powerful than corruption and evil, but you don't give yourself the power you have.
[02:27:35.979 --> 02:27:45.819]  I'm ranting Daniel List here at darkjournalist.com, but can you just in philosophy, just your philosophy, your philosophy, I think we're a lot similar just from talking to you and I admire you.
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:56.079]  Do you get what I'm saying about we need to have an open debate about which way humanity, instead of just opposing globalists, which we're doing and we should, we have to then have a renaissance of real discussion.
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:10.399]  I think?
[02:28:20.319 --> 02:28:25.079]  Is another reason why you experience as much resistance as you do.
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:28.139]  But I think it's a brave step as well.
[02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:35.319]  One of the things I will tell you about what happens when people get knowledge about the UFO file, and I've seen it over and over again.
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:42.420]  When I've gone deep into things that can be proven and have evidence and have witnesses and things like that, people are absolutely stunned.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:52.799]  By the level of secrecy that's involved, and they live in a kind of dream world about the fact that this whole breakaway technology even exists.
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:29:02.690]  They know that the government has something in the background and that they're more advanced, but they can never imagine the level Of lying and secrecy and that wall of secrecy that takes place.
[02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:04.129]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:29:04.250 --> 02:29:16.350]  If you go back even, you know, a couple of centuries and go into people like Gehrte, for example, there's a guy who is deeply well-versed in spirituality, but deeply well-versed in scientific matters.
[02:29:16.530 --> 02:29:22.809]  And that whole kind of Renaissance man idea, you know, was a more complete holistic version of a human being.
[02:29:22.829 --> 02:29:26.469]  And what happened, I think, over time is they splintered these things.
[02:29:28.860 --> 02:29:35.059]  I think we're good to go.
[02:29:35.059 --> 02:29:53.780]  I think we're good to go.
[02:29:58.569 --> 02:30:05.750]  Besides the normal aspirations that humanity has, there's another group that wants to use space for an entirely different purpose.
[02:30:05.950 --> 02:30:11.389]  And that's a huge, covert war going on beneath the surface that we never get to talk about.
[02:30:11.610 --> 02:30:14.090]  It's not just Russia, Iran, and China.
[02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:18.190]  It is humanity and this whole kind of space aspect.
[02:30:18.639 --> 02:30:25.639]  And those things have to be brought in because what you get with the secrecy is more and more secrecy brings you into this separate situation.
[02:30:25.639 --> 02:30:35.639]  The public exists on a different level and you have parallel civilizations going on and the nature of that information becomes then schizophrenic.
[02:30:35.739 --> 02:30:38.000]  The people on the ground don't know what's actually taking place.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:48.610]  A very small group has absconded with the technology, has absconded with the scientific That's the same thing for life is such a technology, the cloning, all of us.
[02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:50.090]  Let's just take one layer of that real quick.
[02:30:51.450 --> 02:30:57.270]  You have the government military, 80% or more of the government space program here, and it's the same for the other big governments.
[02:30:57.649 --> 02:30:59.809]  That's just a generalized number, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:30:59.989 --> 02:31:06.649]  And then you've got the whole debate about, well, we just want robots because that's cheaper and easier, and we'll just leave humans down here.
[02:31:06.709 --> 02:31:09.629]  No, we want to build the movement in space to make it human.
[02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:11.450]  That's how we plant our flag in that.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:17.440]  And it's a microcosm, of course a giant microcosm, of, you know, well, let's just have robots do everything.
[02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:18.879]  Well, let's have a respirator do our breathing.
[02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:20.760]  Well, let's put our brain in a computer chip.
[02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:27.739]  No, we need, so there's a debate about whether space will be human or not, and that's really a debate about whether we're even obsolete or not.
[02:31:27.799 --> 02:31:28.940]  Well, we don't, we're not obsolete.
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:31.139]  We decide to build the future for us.
[02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:33.280]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:31:33.639 --> 02:31:40.680]  So this is a whole transhumanist paradox, if you think about it, because their ultimate version is anti-human.
[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:44.760]  And it goes very deep if you want to really look at where they're coming from.
[02:31:45.239 --> 02:31:50.139]  There is a belief inside of those scientific systems and the people who operate them.
[02:31:50.459 --> 02:32:07.819]  And that belief is that instead of climbing up the normal tree of life, which is outlined in different things like the Kabbalah, and it goes all the way back to the Egyptian mystery schools and things, they believe that they can bypass the tree of life by transmuting from animal,
[02:32:07.979 --> 02:32:17.020]  which they consider humanity as animal, into mineral, which is the cybernetics, the automated human, the augmented human, all that stuff.
[02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:18.479]  So this is the ultimate alchemy.
[02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:19.860]  It is.
[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:20.479]  It is.
[02:32:20.559 --> 02:32:28.819]  And if you look at alchemy and if you look at that whole period when they talked about Philosopher's Stone and things of this nature, this is an outgrowth.
[02:32:29.059 --> 02:32:31.780]  The ultimate scientific materialism crept in.
[02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:40.739]  And the guy I cover who was doing so much work around this back in the 1920s was Rudolf Steiner.
[02:32:40.920 --> 02:33:03.579]  And his whole move around anthroposophy predicted the whole predicament that we're in now in the 21st century And what he termed the force Aramonic coming in and it came in through the technology and the idea was to sever the spiritual connection directly and just have humanity move in these materialistic circles and become more and more coarse and more and more under control.
[02:33:04.049 --> 02:33:07.909]  And what he called it was the eighth sphere development.
[02:33:08.129 --> 02:33:16.889]  And that eighth sphere development is totally different from the normal kind of spiritual evolution of humanity, but it keeps humanity under this dark astral force.
[02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:21.569]  And he said, well, the 21st century, that's the showdown, that's the battle with Ahriman.
[02:33:21.709 --> 02:33:37.719]  And he actually anticipated an incarnation of And the way that he describes it, I think it's so funny and so advanced for 1920, a very erudite information from, I mean, he was a genius and a scholar, but how do you see things this clearly 100 years in advance?
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:52.729]  One of the things that Steiner was able to put across with the Aramonic information was saying, you know, You're looking out at a period where it's a clash of humanity, and if humanity can't have its normal spiritual evolution, it could be interrupted forever.
[02:33:52.950 --> 02:34:00.549]  The entire human experiment could go out the window if the Aramonic scientific materialism powers take full root.
[02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:04.069]  And now Klaus Schwab and all of them say, we are at war with humanity.
[02:34:04.069 --> 02:34:05.450]  We're building something better.
[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:07.680]  It's like the Borg in Star Trek.
[02:34:07.799 --> 02:34:09.159]  They arrive and say, you will be assimilated.
[02:34:09.239 --> 02:34:09.920]  You will surrender.
[02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:11.100]  Resistance is futile.
[02:34:11.559 --> 02:34:14.540]  And it's the most tyrannical, sickening.
[02:34:15.299 --> 02:34:17.540]  It's like Elon Musk talked about 25 years ago.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:18.899]  He's with the Google heads.
[02:34:19.340 --> 02:34:20.799]  And he's like, I want to have children.
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:21.579]  I want a human future.
[02:34:21.639 --> 02:34:23.420]  They're like, how dare you be a natalist?
[02:34:23.479 --> 02:34:24.559]  How dare you, these humans?
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:26.620]  And they were acting like they weren't even human.
[02:34:26.639 --> 02:34:29.520]  But that is a spiritual virus they have.
[02:34:29.959 --> 02:34:31.760]  Literally, they hate humanity.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:38.299]  It is an outside force, a transmission telling us destroy ourselves before we go next level.
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:40.079]  It is.
[02:34:40.139 --> 02:34:42.479]  It is humanity versus this thing.
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:43.700]  There's no question about it.
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:51.459]  And what's interesting is we had a situation where they got The Supreme Court Justice Jackson in.
[02:34:51.899 --> 02:34:54.260]  And one of the questions they asked her was, what is a woman?
[02:34:54.379 --> 02:34:55.799]  And she said, I'm not a biologist.
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:01.180]  That was a very, very important moment in American and human history.
[02:35:01.399 --> 02:35:05.360]  That you could have someone who's gonna sit in the Supreme Court who can't identify what a woman is.
[02:35:05.459 --> 02:35:09.979]  So you can see the level that they're coming in on and the type of operation that they're trying to put.
[02:35:10.139 --> 02:35:13.340]  They're sabotaging basic biological logic to shut it down on their own emissions.
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:16.579]  And again, a woman is an adult human female.
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:21.819]  That has sexual organs, a uterus, a vagina, breast.
[02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:23.239]  She has these type of chromosomes.
[02:35:23.239 --> 02:35:27.479]  It's the most studied, documented thing in the universe.
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  And notice they attack the woman, which is the generator of all of the species, which all of us at the first embryonic level are a female.
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:39.180]  It's an excellent point.
[02:35:39.579 --> 02:35:43.780]  And so basically, if you attack women, you're attacking humanity outright.
[02:35:44.079 --> 02:35:44.819]  That's the end.
[02:35:44.959 --> 02:35:56.559]  And it's very interesting because when you look at the nature, again, of the mythology behind some of these people, at the top of their chain in the tree of life is an androgyne.
[02:35:56.819 --> 02:35:58.639]  It's an androgynous figure.
[02:35:58.799 --> 02:36:03.459]  So it has neither sex, which is what they believe- You're talking about Baphomet or both.
[02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:05.610]  Yes, exactly.
[02:36:05.850 --> 02:36:17.770]  And if you go further back, the whole Belial cult that's talked about in the Mystery School literature and all of that information that comes out of the Casey work, saying that in the Belial period, they had one sex.
[02:36:18.409 --> 02:36:24.729]  And that the great revolution around all this, the kind of spiritual break-off, is when they split into two sexes.
[02:36:25.049 --> 02:36:36.670]  And so they want to go back to this Belial state, which is a single organism, a single sex, where they can do all the reproduction, and they can do it all scientifically, and they can guide that process.
[02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:40.250]  And as Christ said, look at the servants of Belial.
[02:36:40.409 --> 02:36:42.190]  They are literally dying in front of you.
[02:36:42.270 --> 02:36:45.430]  Their energy's been sucked out like a demonic spider slurped their soul.
[02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:47.889]  There's no question.
[02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:50.469]  And this is very active and it's very real.
[02:36:50.690 --> 02:37:00.149]  I mean, when you think about the level of drug addiction and things and then, you know, people's reality and how it can be segmented off and their spirituality can be cut off completely.
[02:37:00.409 --> 02:37:06.889]  And that's where I think the innovation in the research and the information around the mystery schools gives us a balance.
[02:37:07.329 --> 02:37:17.930]  It's been left there on purpose by these groups that are on the inside that are working on a mystery school level on a secret society against the secret society level.
[02:37:18.350 --> 02:37:21.250]  But to program our unconscious and subconscious is very obvious.
[02:37:21.389 --> 02:37:21.889]  Overhead shot.
[02:37:22.129 --> 02:37:26.969]  So here is a pentacle, which Hollywood says you're a star.
[02:37:27.250 --> 02:37:29.170]  Well, it's the human.
[02:37:29.329 --> 02:37:32.250]  The arms, the legs, this is it.
[02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:34.889]  Well, what do the Satanists say they're doing?
[02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:39.309]  It's a human inverted, anti-human.
[02:37:39.489 --> 02:37:40.870]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:44.010]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:37:44.010 --> 02:37:50.290]  And it's very interesting because there is one thing, since you brought up symbols there, which is the symbol of the Enneagram.
[02:37:51.159 --> 02:37:58.819]  And this is quite fascinating because this got brought out actually through the Gurdjieff work in the 1930s, and we finally got it.
[02:37:58.979 --> 02:38:03.860]  People don't still quite understand what this is, but this is another gift of the symbolism back there.
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.899]  And that Enneagram gives you the idea of a totally, perfectly balanced human.
[02:38:10.350 --> 02:38:14.850]  And the idea is your spirituality exists right in the middle of all these physical aspects.
[02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:27.309]  Well, what happens very often when you get certain groups, small groups, you could say, let's say Masonic groups, for example, who hold the symbolism over time, it starts to lose the meaning.
[02:38:27.610 --> 02:38:37.889]  I think we're good to go.
[02:38:46.290 --> 02:38:54.129]  And you're starting to see people understand esoteric information way more differently, even than when I was in college, for example.
[02:38:54.430 --> 02:38:59.149]  People are so far beyond, and they start to realize what's going on.
[02:38:59.229 --> 02:39:04.209]  Once you're attacked, all of this ancestral knowledge is unlocked, and people start leveling up.
[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:05.959]  Yes, exactly.
[02:39:06.219 --> 02:39:11.940]  And it's funny because if you go back into some of those ancient cultures, there are a number of things that they understood.
[02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:20.360]  They understood the nature of spiritual war, definitely, but they also understood humanity versus mechanistic forces.
[02:39:29.650 --> 02:39:32.270]  I don't think it's a comet.
[02:39:41.149 --> 02:39:45.049]  And they basically decimated and turned the planet upside down.
[02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:47.309]  And that's where you get the sinking of Atlantis.
[02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:49.690]  And that's why humanity starts over again.
[02:39:49.850 --> 02:39:52.129]  So they're very knowledgeable.
[02:39:52.129 --> 02:39:53.129]  They're very conscious.
[02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:54.829]  They're high mystics.
[02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.690]  They're philosophers.
[02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:58.489]  And they have all that information.
[02:39:58.649 --> 02:40:00.750]  That's where those stories echoes back to.
[02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:03.569]  And that's where we get the sons of God and all the rest of it.
[02:40:04.090 --> 02:40:08.610]  I think it's too easy to just say, oh, well, advanced aliens came here and that touched down the whole thing.
[02:40:08.729 --> 02:40:10.170]  That kind of cuts us off.
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:12.559]  Well, that's what I said in the first hour.
[02:40:12.659 --> 02:40:29.399]  When you really grasp this, it's that, and we know there have been previous civilizations, and to make it simple, we're the aliens, folks, or we're the advanced intelligence, and we're at the same point again where we get this godlike technology, but we've not advanced spiritually,
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:30.260]  and we destroy ourselves.
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:32.559]  There's no question.
[02:40:32.559 --> 02:40:39.260]  And what's weird is there's a possibility back here that that technology was kept from that period.
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:50.719]  And one of the things that I've done is a series on archaeological wars, where if you look at different periods over time, they've been searching for this information inside those elite groups.
[02:40:50.739 --> 02:40:54.780]  Even if you go back to Hitler, who was searching for the sword.
[02:40:54.959 --> 02:40:57.340]  The British, the Nazis, they're all obsessed with it.
[02:40:58.170 --> 02:40:58.629]  Exactly.
[02:40:58.889 --> 02:41:06.229]  And they want those sacred objects because they realize there's a transformative power, a technology, in fact, that exists within them.
[02:41:06.370 --> 02:41:10.450]  And you could call it the same thing when they were talking about the Atlanteans.
[02:41:10.549 --> 02:41:15.409]  They said, well, they could contact through their power stations, they could contact the saintly realm.
[02:41:15.850 --> 02:41:19.709]  And this other group realized, oh, hey, you know, we can actually set off lasers with this thing.
[02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:20.370]  Let's do that.
[02:41:21.309 --> 02:41:24.530]  So you get this battle between these two forces going on.
[02:41:24.629 --> 02:41:28.450]  But I think that is the nature of the 21st century.
[02:41:28.450 --> 02:41:35.709]  And that's what's coming to the fore, which is people are much more aware that there seems to be something that's closing in on them.
[02:41:35.829 --> 02:41:39.950]  And it's coming from not only a technological space, but in the spiritual zone.
[02:41:40.299 --> 02:41:42.399]  They feel the need for a kind of spiritual protection.
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:42.719]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:42.819 --> 02:41:48.840]  All these people that bought into the whole atheist thing, which you're just saying, all you can see and know and have been told, that's real.
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:50.620]  There's nothing else going on.
[02:41:50.739 --> 02:41:59.420]  You've actually, it's anti-science, and the ancient term of spiritualism or alchemy was theoretical understandings, what we were already imprinted with, that now the science continues to prove.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:03.079]  And you look at all these genetic engineers and others, they're all over the place saying, I didn't believe in God, but now I do.
[02:42:03.159 --> 02:42:04.620]  There's no way this just came from nowhere.
[02:42:06.090 --> 02:42:06.370]  Right.
[02:42:06.430 --> 02:42:08.469]  It's only the most arrogant ones that do.
[02:42:08.670 --> 02:42:19.549]  And it's very interesting because if you're in Russia, their scientific community and their research around things like UFOs, etc., includes a spiritual psychic element.
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.319]  Whereas ours on the surface leaves that out.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:30.280]  Behind the scenes, they study the psychic aspect and the spiritual side only as kind of a tool for how can we use this as a weapon.
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:45.840]  But one of the things that we became aware of on our side is, oh, the Soviet Union back in the day were very, very far ahead of us in terms of psychic experiments, in terms of astral projection, and the things that they would train their astronauts in.
[02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:48.809]  That's where we got into our own remote viewing program, etc.
[02:42:49.209 --> 02:42:53.829]  There's a psychic aspect that's left out because they want to dominate that field of things.
[02:42:53.989 --> 02:42:54.809]  I totally agree with you.
[02:42:54.809 --> 02:43:01.530]  You're gonna be back next week, but the few minutes we have left, the timeline we're on, clearly they're getting ready.
[02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:02.350]  They're creating the fear.
[02:43:02.510 --> 02:43:08.069]  We're already in a blue beam-esque soft rollout, use that archetypal street term people use.
[02:43:08.969 --> 02:43:10.370]  What are you looking at the timelines?
[02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:14.149]  What are some of the scenarios you think we'll see in the next 37 days till Trump gets in?
[02:43:15.829 --> 02:43:18.790]  I think this is really the danger zone period.
[02:43:19.229 --> 02:43:23.030]  And so there's a kind of a maximum peril situation that they could create.
[02:43:23.049 --> 02:43:27.409]  We saw the big push around the World War III scenario coming in.
[02:43:28.689 --> 02:43:39.489]  And obviously Putin is trying to hang in there as much as possible until Trump gets in there so he can deal with someone who's a sane individual instead of this machine that is dying to get him out.
[02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:41.170]  But look how fast they can do things now.
[02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:43.690]  With a snap of their fingers, Assad is out of there.
[02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:45.229]  We have to watch things very closely.
[02:43:45.329 --> 02:43:46.870]  They've been trying to get Assad out of there for what?
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:49.719]  14 years, and now they can just do it that easily.
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:53.719]  So obviously, they're pulling out all the stops and they're going for it.
[02:43:53.819 --> 02:44:00.940]  I would say with the UFO file, it's underappreciated the level of what the intelligence agencies have done with the UFO threat.
[02:44:01.059 --> 02:44:03.680]  And so it comes on the public unawares.
[02:44:03.879 --> 02:44:12.139]  One of the things I would like to do is introduce the full idea of the continuity of government program can be activated by a UFO threat, even if it's a false threat.
[02:44:12.979 --> 02:44:21.020]  I think that the UFO file is absolutely real, but I don't think the CIA or the NGA or any of those guys are going to give us the real thing around it.
[02:44:21.139 --> 02:44:24.719]  So I think there's a real threat there around the continuity of government program.
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:35.979]  And when we see these UFOs forms and the drones forms, That is definitely, they have that clock where you're moving closer to the atomic doomsday, and they move it here and they move it here.
[02:44:36.079 --> 02:44:43.680]  Well, this isn't doomsday, but they're moving that clock closer and closer to the UFO file threat takeover narrative.
[02:44:43.719 --> 02:44:46.799]  So they just moved it dramatically with these drone swarms.
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:50.719]  One of the best interviews we've ever done, I mean, not just with him, period.
[02:44:51.979 --> 02:44:53.579]  Daniel List, ourjournalist.com.
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:55.799]  Talk to my producers next week.
[02:44:56.079 --> 02:44:56.780]  I want you to host.
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:57.319]  Two hours.
[02:44:57.479 --> 02:44:58.040]  Honored to have you.
[02:44:58.180 --> 02:44:58.840]  Thank you so much.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:44:59.459]  Great job.
[02:45:00.239 --> 02:45:00.899]  I can't wait, Alex.
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:02.079]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:45:02.219 --> 02:45:02.620]  Thank you, sir.
[02:45:02.739 --> 02:45:03.860]  We'll be right back with more news.
[02:45:03.979 --> 02:45:04.399]  Stay with me.
[02:45:04.719 --> 02:45:10.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:11.579]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:45:11.819 --> 02:45:13.479]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:45:13.559 --> 02:45:16.520]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:45:16.659 --> 02:45:18.340]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:20.760]  The The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:23.239]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:45:23.379 --> 02:45:29.100]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:34.520]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:43.239]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:45:43.319 --> 02:45:46.620]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:45:46.819 --> 02:45:54.840]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:45:55.079 --> 02:45:58.260]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:45:59.780]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:00.739]  Go check it out.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.879]  That's there discounted up to $50.
[02:46:02.909 --> 02:46:07.649]  55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:46:07.829 --> 02:46:08.370]  Try it.
[02:46:08.430 --> 02:46:09.049]  You're going to love it.
[02:46:09.129 --> 02:46:09.569]  I'm on it.
[02:46:09.569 --> 02:46:10.430]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:46:10.690 --> 02:46:11.389]  It's insane.
[02:46:11.530 --> 02:46:12.530]  Get that and other supplements.
[02:46:12.709 --> 02:46:17.190]  And then there's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:46:17.430 --> 02:46:23.719]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the Top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:24.639]  They have the best designs.
[02:46:25.100 --> 02:46:26.799]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:46:26.879 --> 02:46:29.280]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:46:29.659 --> 02:46:30.940]  These designs are incredible.
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:37.360]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.079]  Here they are.
[02:46:38.270 --> 02:46:39.049]  Look at this one.
[02:46:39.209 --> 02:46:43.149]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:46:43.350 --> 02:46:45.129]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:46:45.290 --> 02:46:46.309]  You've got to get that.
[02:46:46.889 --> 02:46:48.629]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:49.569]  Oh my goodness.
[02:46:49.989 --> 02:46:53.190]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:56.590]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:46:57.049 --> 02:46:58.209]  Team Humanity.
[02:46:58.430 --> 02:46:59.889]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:47:00.010 --> 02:47:02.229]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:04.170]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:09.790]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:11.110]  Darkest Hour.
[02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:12.590]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:47:12.829 --> 02:47:17.629]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:47:17.629 --> 02:47:19.850]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:25.229]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:47:25.350 --> 02:47:37.850]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:47:37.909 --> 02:47:41.590]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:47:42.019 --> 02:47:45.559]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:47.979]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:47:48.159 --> 02:47:49.399]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:50.739]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:53.940]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:47:54.079 --> 02:47:54.920]  And they spread the word.
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:55.680]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:48:02.079]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:48:02.159 --> 02:48:05.319]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:16.329]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:48:16.489 --> 02:48:18.930]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:29.229]  If you really wanna support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:48:29.370 --> 02:48:31.190]  But regardless, you're gonna love the supplements.
[02:48:31.450 --> 02:48:32.649]  You're gonna wanna order again.
[02:48:32.930 --> 02:48:35.090]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:48:35.459 --> 02:48:36.520]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:37.479]  We're going after them.
[02:48:37.579 --> 02:48:43.620]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:45.079]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:48.819]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:48:48.959 --> 02:48:58.440]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:01.100]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:01.219 --> 02:49:02.420]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:07.000]  A great time of change is upon us.
[02:49:07.159 --> 02:49:08.440]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:19.159]  I am here to do the best I can to accurately break down what's happening and to try to get the public to realize the decision's been made to set up a tyrannical world.
[02:49:19.379 --> 02:49:23.340]  Government replaces the robots and kill almost every human on the face of the earth.
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:31.440]  Promethean fire is something the establishment doesn't want us to have.
[02:49:32.329 --> 02:49:40.590]  This broadcast is promoting an alternate vision and plan, and I'm just simply asking you to participate.
[02:49:41.409 --> 02:49:46.389]  Now, I want to be 100% clear with listeners and viewers.
[02:49:47.270 --> 02:49:50.489]  The establishment does not want this broadcast on air.
[02:49:50.670 --> 02:49:51.309]  You know that.
[02:49:51.450 --> 02:49:56.729]  We are having massive effects against their operations and their tyranny.
[02:49:57.129 --> 02:49:58.870]  There is not just evil in the universe.
[02:50:00.159 --> 02:50:14.000]  There's a lot of good, but evil counts on you not realizing how important you are with your word of mouth, sharing the articles, the videos, sharing other great people's information, you speaking up, you calling in, you doing your own shows.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:17.340]  There's different things all of us can do.
[02:50:17.659 --> 02:50:20.979]  And many of us together make light work.
[02:50:21.139 --> 02:50:22.180]  Many hands make light work.
[02:50:22.319 --> 02:50:27.579]  But this Christmas, it is so important to spread the word about liberty and the Great Awakening.
[02:50:27.739 --> 02:50:33.760]  It is so important to support the broadcast and shows and journalists, individuals, that the establishment's coming after.
[02:50:34.139 --> 02:50:37.159]  And we make it easy for you to support Infowars.
[02:50:37.319 --> 02:50:40.139]  And the Alex Jones Network is a backup if they're able to shut us down.
[02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:47.590]  By simply going to thealexjonesstore.com, that it's not owned by me, that it's not part of Infowars, if the bad guys still get it.
[02:50:48.969 --> 02:50:50.729]  And I hope they won't.
[02:50:50.969 --> 02:51:08.149]  But regardless, that will allow us, in the next month, with Trump getting back into office, and after that, to be there supporting an attempt to turn the tide completely, we've already turned it, but completely, and take advantage of this great awakening to try to save human civilization.
[02:51:09.450 --> 02:51:10.930]  For ourselves and our children's future.
[02:51:11.909 --> 02:51:14.690]  So please go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:51:15.569 --> 02:51:17.170]  I am so glad this is back.

[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.719]  One little scoop in water, the energy, the focus, the clarity.

[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:29.940]  People love it.
[02:51:30.079 --> 02:51:34.799]  It is amazing, and it's back in stock discounted at thealexjonesstore.com.

[02:52:05.010 --> 02:52:08.590]  Amazing patriot year to spread the word, to wake people up, to meet like-minded folks.

[02:52:19.719 --> 02:52:20.440]  It's fun.
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:24.479]  The folks that barely came up with this, it's a great way to give a gift.
[02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:30.840]  We have the campaign coins, liberty coins, that are nice mementos.
[02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:34.819]  From $9, you know, up to $25, and it all funds the Infowar.

[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:46.479]  We'll know by the middle of January whether we're going to survive.
[02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:50.000]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though he was overrode.
[02:52:50.159 --> 02:52:53.180]  The judge said you're actually going to sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[02:52:53.659 --> 02:52:58.959]  We're going to work on that with outside groups that won't censor us, but who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are going to do.
[02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:01.579]  But regardless, we continue on.
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:02.719]  The info war is you.
[02:53:02.819 --> 02:53:03.139]  It's me.
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:03.840]  It's the people.
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:04.579]  It's questioning.
[02:53:04.579 --> 02:53:05.379]  It's researching.
[02:53:05.559 --> 02:53:06.459]  It's promoting liberty.
[02:53:06.659 --> 02:53:07.799]  It's resisting tyranny.
[02:53:08.079 --> 02:53:13.840]  And that's why going to thealexjonesstore.com will ensure that future operation regardless of what they do.
[02:53:14.059 --> 02:53:15.379]  Now is the time of action.

[02:53:24.350 --> 02:53:25.329]  You are the missionaries.
[02:53:25.350 --> 02:53:27.170]  You are the ambassadors of freedom.

[02:53:35.850 --> 02:53:50.430]  We're good to go.
[02:53:50.549 --> 02:53:52.489]  Of loving God and loving justice.
[02:53:52.809 --> 02:53:57.370]  And I gotta tell you, amazing guest, Daniel List, our journalist, the last hour and a half.
[02:53:57.770 --> 02:54:00.809]  Now Jay Dyer about to take over for the rest of the hour.
[02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:07.670]  A guy that goes pretty much only to their own source documents, their own publications, the globalist own admissions.
[02:54:08.569 --> 02:54:12.549]  And that's one of my greatest frustrations too, is this thing is so obvious, it's out in the open.
[02:54:13.049 --> 02:54:15.989]  But metaphysically, they have to admit in the fine print what they're doing.
[02:54:17.569 --> 02:54:19.510]  They just hope you don't actually go look at it.
[02:54:20.569 --> 02:54:26.229]  Hand the baton to him in just a minute or two, but I just selfishly, because I'm going to be listening to him, but I don't know if he's going to bring this up.
[02:54:27.649 --> 02:54:34.870]  What does he make of the exponential rollout of these UFOs, these unidentified flying vehicles, UAVs, all of it?
[02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:48.780]  And does he agree with myself and list that this is obviously to trigger the COG powers that in 2007 they changed, not just for nuclear war, natural disaster, but for nuclear UFO invasion.
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:50.059]  I mean, that's in there.
[02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:51.559]  We've covered it in the last hour and a half.
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:52.600]  That's amazing.
[02:54:52.739 --> 02:54:53.540]  We'll talk to Jay Dyer.
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.299]  I'll just ask, I already asked him the question.
[02:54:55.719 --> 02:54:57.319]  We'll hand the baton to him to answer that.
[02:54:58.139 --> 02:55:00.979]  He's always prepared to cover the incredible topics he's got.
[02:55:01.459 --> 02:55:03.120]  And I never really talked to him before he comes on.
[02:55:03.219 --> 02:55:04.100]  It's always a surprise.
[02:55:04.239 --> 02:55:05.000]  I want to eat my lunch.
[02:55:05.079 --> 02:55:05.600]  I'm about to do.
[02:55:06.589 --> 02:55:12.090]  And listen to Jay Dyer every Friday because of the news and the martial law plans and all that.
[02:55:12.229 --> 02:55:16.250]  We haven't been having the fourth hour guests for a while, but they're back now and InfoWars barely survived.
[02:55:16.290 --> 02:55:23.690]  We've been given another little lease on life here and that takes money again to fight the Democrats in the deep state and we're winning and that's why your support's so critical.
[02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:25.350]  So let me bring up one quick thing about the sponsor.
[02:55:26.809 --> 02:55:29.030]  DRJonesNaturals.com, my dad's supplement company.
[02:55:29.229 --> 02:55:29.729]  It's amazing.

[02:55:56.870 --> 02:56:06.649]  Now, the best seller currently on that site, and I know now it's going to be Vitamineral Fusion because that's been sold out, but normally the best seller when that's sold out is Next Level Financial Energy.
[02:56:06.930 --> 02:56:08.309]  This is about to sell out.
[02:56:08.610 --> 02:56:17.069]  This is not a stimulant, but it feels like one and cleans out your mitochondria that's so important for your health and your immune system and gives you energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.

[02:57:28.639 --> 02:57:29.139]  It's essential.
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:31.840]  You need oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[02:57:32.100 --> 02:57:33.600]  Water, you die in four or five days.
[02:57:33.799 --> 02:57:34.940]  Food, you die in a couple months.
[02:57:35.079 --> 02:57:36.799]  Because what's in vitamins and minerals are in the food.
[02:57:38.079 --> 02:57:41.540]  When something's essential, it just takes months without these vitamins and minerals to kill you.
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:43.639]  But it's still just as essential as oxygen.
[02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:44.979]  It's all in there.
[02:57:45.159 --> 02:57:45.440]  Everything.
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:47.180]  Everything is in there you need.
[02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:49.879]  drjonesnaggles.com All right, Jay.
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:51.899]  Thank you so much for being here.
[02:57:52.059 --> 02:58:00.739]  I know you've got your own agenda, which I'm sorry to interrupt, but just I really want to know your opinion on this unprecedented drone swarm, where this is going.
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.799]  And thank you so much and have a Merry Christmas.
[02:58:03.319 --> 02:58:05.059]  You're in command now, my friend.
[02:58:09.739 --> 02:58:11.139]  You think you got yourself muted, Jay?
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:12.620]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[02:58:13.739 --> 02:58:14.399]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:16.520]  Yeah, thank you for that.
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.860]  I had the same mindset as you had in the first couple hours when you discussed this topic.
[02:58:22.059 --> 02:58:29.930]  I liked your Point that you made about the possibility of demonstrating to other countries what type of drone capabilities we might have.
[02:58:30.090 --> 02:58:36.670]  And one way to understand this is to look at who's over all this kind of drone aerial phenomenon in the United States.
[02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:39.770]  And it's entities like the Naval Reconnaissance Office.
[02:58:39.969 --> 02:58:48.790]  It's entities like You know, the same people, like you mentioned, that would be running the continuity of government were there to be some so-called national emergency.
[02:58:49.209 --> 02:59:02.170]  Everybody remembers, I'm sure, the announcement at the United Nations where Reagan said that perhaps we need an external global threat that could unite all of the nations together in a kind of new world order.
[02:59:03.159 --> 02:59:17.860]  If you think back to all the alien movies, the very propaganda of the earliest days that the mythos of Hollywood was putting out in terms of alien stories, if you think about something like The Day the Earth Stood Still, that's exactly the message of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
[02:59:18.059 --> 02:59:27.360]  If the nations don't come together, if they don't form a world government and engage in disarmament, then we won't have world peace.
[02:59:27.579 --> 02:59:33.850]  And the enlightened, advanced space brothers We're good to go.
[02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:57.459]  We're good to go.
[03:00:09.979 --> 03:00:20.000]  He was speaking to these beings that were giving him information on electrodes, on RFID chips, things that he was literally working with the Navy for.
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:26.979]  So a lot of times people think this is run by some men in black thing, but it's actually, I think, a lot of times run by the Navy.
[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:29.059]  They're actually behind a lot of these things.
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:44.420]  The NRO. And my initial analysis is that I don't believe that aliens are going to be using blinking lights, the same type of blinking lights that you would see on a very terrestrial, Earth-based drone.
[03:00:44.819 --> 03:00:53.760]  And a lot of people from the military are actually posting on Twitter their versions, their examples of drones that are really advanced.
[03:00:55.099 --> 03:01:01.579]  I disagree quite a bit, for example, with Jim Mars, but I was pulling out some of my old Jim Mars books from back in the day.
[03:01:01.719 --> 03:01:04.239]  And I know Jim used to be on Alex quite a bit back in the day.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:15.639]  And Jim Mars actually had A pretty interesting chapter where he talked about a lot of the drone technology that you would see in the future 10, 20, 30 years later.
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:19.620]  So he was writing books in the 2000s about drone technology.
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:23.159]  Now, he believed in actual foreign extra biological entities.
[03:01:23.319 --> 03:01:24.319]  I don't believe in that.
[03:01:24.479 --> 03:01:29.819]  I think that's part of the PSYOP. But I did enjoy the insights that Jim Mars had into drone technology.
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:38.959]  So even within the domain of the known UFO researchers, Advanced drone technology goes back to Vietnam.
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:49.940]  If you read Annie Jacobson's book on the history of DARPA, she talks about what would eventually become DARPA. That's where we get the internet, ARPANET, etc.
[03:01:50.159 --> 03:01:59.079]  They were actually working on with the Air Force at the time of Vietnam, already using unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs.
[03:01:59.710 --> 03:02:01.750]  So, this is not anything new.
[03:02:02.030 --> 03:02:07.290]  Now, it is true, I think, that a lot of what they do and a lot of the research is kept, you know, hidden.
[03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:10.350]  So, they do have suppressed secret technologies.
[03:02:11.010 --> 03:02:15.270]  And they are proficient at keeping technology suppressed.
[03:02:15.270 --> 03:02:17.309]  People think that, well, they couldn't keep a secret.
[03:02:17.950 --> 03:02:19.149]  They can keep secrets.
[03:02:19.270 --> 03:02:21.389]  They kept the Manhattan Project secret for a long time.
[03:02:21.530 --> 03:02:23.690]  I mean, eventually this stuff does get out.
[03:02:24.239 --> 03:02:32.860]  But no, I don't think that the stealth bomber is the most advanced form of aerial phenomena or aerial technology that they have.
[03:02:32.979 --> 03:02:34.059]  This is just my speculation.
[03:02:34.079 --> 03:02:39.500]  But even people in the military who are just kind of mainstream, they'll talk about pretty openly.
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:53.579]  I met a guy, for example, that was in the military about 10 years ago, and he was discussing drones that they had at the base that he was at that were able to just take off basically like a UFO, and they were completely silent.
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:03:16.000]  I've never had any weird UFO experiences or anything like that, but I remember one time, maybe in about 2008 or 9, I was driving through a really remote, wooded area of Tennessee, which is next to, it was relatively close to some military bases that are well-known in Tennessee.
[03:03:16.299 --> 03:03:21.540]  And in this very rural area, I did witness a very low-flying drone.
[03:03:21.819 --> 03:03:27.049]  This is, remember, in 2007-8 era, Drones weren't reported on very much.
[03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:32.729]  This was kind of the era when it was rolling out that there was a lot of drone tech.
[03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:42.329]  This is when Obama was talking about using drones in warfare, in foreign entanglements to assassinate leaders of other countries or whatever.
[03:03:42.450 --> 03:03:43.629]  Al-Qaeda, there was a big drone.
[03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:45.270]  Remember the drone scandal under Obama?
[03:03:45.409 --> 03:03:47.950]  This was right around that time, right prior to that.
[03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:54.569]  And I did park my car and I got out and I witnessed a very low flying, completely silent drone.
[03:03:55.659 --> 03:04:03.180]  Again, this is around 2007 or 2008. And it did actually sort of accelerate and fly away at a really intense speed.
[03:04:03.879 --> 03:04:05.299]  It had blinking lights.
[03:04:05.459 --> 03:04:15.379]  I don't think the aliens are using blinking lights like American aircraft use blinking lights to identify that human aircraft.
[03:04:15.379 --> 03:04:16.780]  I guess this is all over the world.
[03:04:16.899 --> 03:04:18.100]  Everybody uses blinking lights.
[03:04:18.239 --> 03:04:18.420]  I don't know.
[03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:22.680]  But, I mean, it's just obvious, I think, that a lot of that is terrestrial.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.040]  It's military technology.
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:33.840]  The military has utilized, believe it or not, the alien mythos and story to cover up black operations.
[03:04:34.299 --> 03:04:53.299]  So, for example, at places like Area 51, it's well known, in fact, that Annie Jacobson wrote a whole other book on the history of Area 51. And the alien mythos and cover that they use sometimes as a kind of a distraction and a deflection for Advanced drone,
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:58.479]  advanced tech, importing drugs, importing humans.
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:01.979]  I mean, they can use this black ops cover.
[03:05:03.040 --> 03:05:05.620]  They can use this cover for all kinds of black operations.
[03:05:05.879 --> 03:05:15.399]  And there are many stories, a lot of journalists have broken stories about The nefarious activities going on at some of these bases.
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:19.379]  So I think that's probably what's going on that's more likely.
[03:05:19.620 --> 03:05:30.139]  Some of the more nefarious characters in American military history have also been involved in the space program and in the Air Force programs studying the era phenomenon.
[03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:42.389]  For example, Michael Aquino According to his own testimony, the founder of the Temple of Said, the most famous Satanist after Aleister Crowley, perhaps, or Anton LaVey in the last century, he wrote the army's psychological warfare doctrine, mind war to side war.
[03:05:42.629 --> 03:05:51.510]  He was involved in studying and working with the psychological warfare operations involved in the aerial phenomena of UFOs.
[03:05:51.709 --> 03:05:53.469]  So what does that tell me?
[03:05:53.610 --> 03:06:13.209]  Well, the more that you dive into this question and the people involved in this question, the history of this question, And I'm not saying there are no spiritual phenomena or there are no weird, unexplained phenomena, but specifically the US-based mythos of the alien crash narrative,
[03:06:13.389 --> 03:06:23.920]  Roswell's story, The more we go into that, the more that we go into the early people who were abductees, the Georgia Damskys, the Betty and the Barney Hills.
[03:06:24.399 --> 03:06:27.579]  What we find is that all of these stories really fall apart very quick.
[03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:37.399]  And they don't just fall apart because of, you know, some weird guy who's, you know, doing LSD or something who has a vision or he thinks he sees aliens or something, you know.
[03:06:40.759 --> 03:06:41.000]  We're good to go.
[03:07:07.430 --> 03:07:30.809]  And elucidated in a lot of scholarly detail in their book, Invoking the Beyond, Georgia Damke's story was actually protected and fostered by none other than Alan Dulles, who was at that time the head of the CIA. Now, why would the head of the CIA care to threaten to take to court anyone who tried to question or debunk George Adamski's story.
[03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:36.690]  This is, again, the first most famous abductee who was taken up on the craft and he saw the ship.
[03:07:38.049 --> 03:07:40.129]  There's always a sexual element to it.
[03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:43.209]  It's always very sort of primal and Freudian and Jungian.
[03:07:43.350 --> 03:07:48.209]  They have these things that they put in your butt and they're probing you and all this kind of nonsense.
[03:07:48.430 --> 03:07:56.590]  I think that is all intended to appeal to kind of our archetypal base nature as a new mythos.
[03:07:56.989 --> 03:07:59.829]  And why would I say it's a new mythos that's being planned?
[03:08:26.549 --> 03:08:36.190]  People at Brookings Institute who were doing a white paper for NASA. And they came up with what I would call religious engineering propositions.
[03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:37.229]  And what do I mean by that?
[03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:42.750]  I mean the idea of concocting an entirely new mythos for the West, for Western civilization.
[03:08:44.319 --> 03:08:47.860]  And this is from the book The Lure of the Edge by Brenda Densler.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:09:01.420]  She is a University of California professor, and she wrote this really good book on the history of the alien phenomena and how it connects to cults, how it connects to mind control, again, from an academic perspective, not from a conspiracy perspective.
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:20.270]  And she mentions that this 1960s Brookings Institute paper published Working together with the theories of Arthur C. Clarke, who himself was, as far as we know, a PEDO, and he was a member of various esoteric orders and sects,
[03:09:20.969 --> 03:09:28.469]  he pointed out that this would be, by Christians, all called demonic activity.
[03:09:28.770 --> 03:09:39.430]  But in a 1960s Brookings Institute paper, It stated that the effects of the discovery of ET life on Christianity, religious fundamentalism, and all religious traditions would be electrifying.
[03:09:39.629 --> 03:09:41.850]  It would have far-reaching potential.
[03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:51.129]  It would, in fact, be a powerful social force, in other words, a social revolutionary force, the alien life theory.
[03:09:53.409 --> 03:10:03.170]  Science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke felt that the doctrine of the incarnation of Christ It was a ticking time bomb and that it would fall apart when this was announced.
[03:10:05.149 --> 03:10:15.149]  One psychologist in the UFO community stated that this would actually be a long-time battle that was going on and this cover-up was about to be known and revealed.
[03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:28.540]  Not only would the idea of the incarnation itself come under review, As one investigator put it, the whole Christian idea of the plan of salvation would be severely problematized.
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:30.020]  So this is from the white paper.
[03:10:30.079 --> 03:10:32.680]  That was a quote from the professor.
[03:10:32.959 --> 03:10:34.399]  This is from the white paper itself.
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:38.899]  The Christian religion would be compromised by the discovery of ET life.
[03:10:39.430 --> 03:10:48.069]  Because it makes so much of the doctrine of the Incarnation as a historical event, and of the knowledge of the good news of Jesus Christ and His passion, ascension, and atonement, that that is the essence of salvation.
[03:10:48.069 --> 03:10:53.909]  It would rather have the effect to maintain that the Incarnation, the crucifixion of the Son of God, occurred on innumerable worlds.
[03:10:53.909 --> 03:11:02.850]  So we would immediately have to have this doctrine of multi-worlds, multiverse, that Jesus is an alien being, perhaps saving aliens on other planets.
[03:11:04.719 --> 03:11:07.739]  And thus, the good news would have to be a gospel that's spread throughout the universe.
[03:11:07.959 --> 03:11:13.020]  This would be a vain effort for the distant galaxies that are so far away that they would probably never be contacted.
[03:11:13.219 --> 03:11:24.239]  And so, ultimately, this would be the collapse of Christianity because it would compromise not just the incarnation but also the idea of divine providence because God didn't save the alien world.
[03:11:24.700 --> 03:11:40.959]  So from the Brookings Institute papers in 1960, they were already discussing and theorizing about how this new mythos, this new narrative, would undo the existing mythos of the biblical heritage of Western civilization.
[03:11:41.079 --> 03:11:52.079]  So in other words, it's enough to destroy and undo Christianity, so they believe, just by announcing the possibility or the existence of alien life on other planets.
[03:11:52.829 --> 03:11:56.469]  On other solar systems or even life existing outside of Earth.
[03:11:57.450 --> 03:12:00.510]  Now, whether you believe that's true or not, that's up to you.
[03:12:00.610 --> 03:12:15.389]  But what I'm saying is that in 1960, they were already studying the social engineering impact that a new mythos, a new alien myth, a new alien story would have to destroy the existing belief systems.
[03:12:16.270 --> 03:12:17.489]  Why would they want to do that?
[03:12:17.629 --> 03:12:30.469]  Well, from the vantage point of the elite, and this would include people like Arthur C. Clarke and the people at Brookings and others, they actually believe that all religions are just concocted, made-up, synthesized myths.
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:38.600]  So, Christianity, they would say, is just some cycle of incarnation of the various older religious traditions.
[03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:40.840]  It's another version of the Osiris myth.
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:45.200]  It's another version of Egyptian mythology or whatever, Ra.
[03:12:45.940 --> 03:12:48.319]  Or, you know, some other ancient myth.
[03:12:48.459 --> 03:12:52.579]  It's Inkyl, it's Inky, all this kind of Mesopotamian stuff, Samarian stuff.
[03:12:52.620 --> 03:13:00.620]  So, they see the ancient religions as really just recycled stories, and there's none or no better than the others.
[03:13:00.899 --> 03:13:09.719]  They're only better insofar as they match up to the agenda of the technocratic elites that want to steer society into the direction of a technocratic agenda.
[03:13:10.239 --> 03:13:19.889]  And so, thus, the alien mythos, the alien story that they are pushing fits perfectly into the narrative that they want For a technocratic global governance.
[03:13:20.129 --> 03:13:21.569]  And this is not surprising.
[03:13:21.629 --> 03:13:39.629]  Many of the people who said they wanted a, quote, Luciferian global government, as H.G. Wells says in his book, God the Invisible King, said they would have to create a new religious myth, a new story for Western civilization that Doesn't just have man's redemption and salvation,
[03:13:39.850 --> 03:13:49.170]  but this kind of evolving into godhood status where we have to depopulate, where we have to have a technocratic control grid.
[03:13:49.170 --> 03:13:53.389]  It just so happens to match up with what the technocrats want.
[03:13:53.530 --> 03:13:54.329]  Now, isn't that odd?
[03:13:54.510 --> 03:14:03.790]  Why does the Alien story and mythos, going back to its very origins of the MJ-12 and Roswell and the early alien promoters.
[03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:06.610]  How come it just happens to match up with what the technocrats want?
[03:14:06.989 --> 03:14:09.329]  It just happens to match up with what the UN wants.
[03:14:09.629 --> 03:14:11.549]  The aliens are telling us to depopulate.
[03:14:11.649 --> 03:14:17.069]  The aliens are telling us to have a global government, to have a dearmament, to have gun control.
[03:14:17.270 --> 03:14:22.309]  It just happens to match up with everything that the degenerate, wicked elite wants.
[03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:24.270]  I mean, that should tell you something, right?
[03:14:24.489 --> 03:14:28.170]  And why is the system suddenly promoting aliens everywhere?
[03:14:28.900 --> 03:14:33.719]  When for many, many decades, they played the part of, oh, there are no aliens.
[03:14:33.879 --> 03:14:36.200]  You're crazy if you even look into this.
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:41.040]  And now suddenly in the last few years, you've got hearings in Congress.
[03:14:41.379 --> 03:14:42.879]  Oh, we've got UAPs.
[03:14:42.940 --> 03:14:44.020]  We've got underwater craft.
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:44.799]  They're real.
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:52.319]  And the people who are promoting it are all a bunch of people from the deep state themselves, a bunch of military psyops people.
[03:14:52.500 --> 03:14:55.030]  By the way, Newsflash, those are the people who lie.
[03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:57.489]  Those are people who are trained to lie.
[03:14:57.670 --> 03:15:03.729]  Like the number one thing you do when you enter that life, that domain, is you are trained to lie.
[03:15:04.510 --> 03:15:11.850]  And if you want the easiest way to debunk all of this, there's a great documentary that was made some years back, about 10 years ago.
[03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:12.889]  It's called Mirage Men.
[03:15:13.649 --> 03:15:21.010]  Mirage Men is a documentary where they go and they interview people like Richard Doty and others who were involved in counterintelligence for the Air Force.
[03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:27.010]  And in his case, he was involved in helping to concoct the alien myth.
[03:15:27.149 --> 03:15:28.190]  Yes, you heard me correctly.
[03:15:28.999 --> 03:15:38.860]  He sits there and says, yeah, let me tell you all the tricks I use to profile idiot narcissists who believe that they're chosen by the aliens to give a new gospel to humanity.
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:42.799]  And we find these quacks and these idiots, and we just feed them a bunch of disinfo.
[03:15:42.959 --> 03:15:51.540]  And we bring them to the base, and we tell them they're going to meet with a general, and we play a VHS tape of some crappy B-movie set version of a UFO flying.
[03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:55.659]  And they actually believe it because the general comes in and says, we've chosen you to give the message to the people.
[03:15:55.700 --> 03:15:56.700]  So it's a psyop.
[03:15:56.829 --> 03:15:58.010]  And it's all in that document.
[03:15:58.090 --> 03:15:58.889]  It's a great documentary.
[03:15:58.969 --> 03:16:06.090]  You have to watch that as a starting place for understanding the UFO alien PSYOP scam.
[03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:08.110]  And there it is, right there.
[03:16:08.549 --> 03:16:10.229]  There's Richard Doty in that documentary.
[03:16:10.450 --> 03:16:11.670]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:19.139]  Welcome back to the Ox Jones Show.
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:20.739]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jays and Hussles.
[03:17:20.739 --> 03:17:33.040]  We're talking about the UFO alien mythology, the crafting of a new myth, a new story, a new grand narrative for Western civilization, which will merge into a new story.
[03:17:33.129 --> 03:17:50.930]  Hegelian dialectical synthesis with the rest of the Darwinian mythos to promote a new idea of man being seeded by the alien visitors as a kind of DNA experiment to create a future race of supposed genetically pure beings.
[03:17:51.129 --> 03:18:01.659]  And in fact, if you go back to the origins of a lot of the people who promoted The alien mythos or what would become the alien mythos a long time ago, they were absolutely 100% proponents of dysgenics, eugenics.
[03:18:01.799 --> 03:18:13.000]  They believed in the evolutionary control that could be tweaking mankind to create a future transhumanist super being.
[03:18:13.379 --> 03:18:15.780]  So we mentioned earlier HG Wells.
[03:18:15.959 --> 03:18:18.239]  HG Wells wasn't just an expert in propaganda.
[03:18:18.239 --> 03:18:20.260]  He actually put his propaganda to work.
[03:18:20.399 --> 03:18:30.079]  And so he wrote famous books like War of the Worlds, which were really intended, I think, to seed the idea of what we're talking about with the alien myth.
[03:18:30.219 --> 03:18:38.920]  And I'm not joking when I say that all the same people pushing the alien myth, when you go into their writings, they're all believers in transhumanism.
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:40.299]  They're all believers in eugenics.
[03:18:40.399 --> 03:18:42.000]  They're all believers in mass depopulation.
[03:18:42.540 --> 03:18:51.459]  And what better story or mythology to use to promote those ideas than the idea that we're seeded by far-off alien god beings and visitors.
[03:18:51.680 --> 03:18:56.739]  And those god beings are here to help train us, to lead us into ascension.
[03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:00.219]  You know, the ascension of the next millennium, whatever kind of new age stuff.
[03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:08.120]  And if you think that that's all kooky and quackery, well, some of the most important movers and shakers of the 1960s counterculture...
[03:19:08.459 --> 03:19:15.260]  They actually went and gave lectures and talks on aliens and the new alien mythology at the Esalen Institute.
[03:19:15.399 --> 03:19:25.260]  Esalen Institute was one of the foremost think tanks, kind of promoting and running the alien mythology that we have today, and the whole 1960s New Age counterculture.
[03:19:25.459 --> 03:19:33.620]  I have a mainline history of the Esalen Institute right here by Jeffrey Kreipel, and there's a whole chapter on the alien history.
[03:19:36.670 --> 03:19:39.610]  We're good to go.
[03:19:53.569 --> 03:19:58.389]  I mean, at the same time, it's not just H.G. Wells that was really helping to promote this.
[03:19:58.489 --> 03:19:59.430]  It was also Hollywood.
[03:19:59.430 --> 03:20:11.950]  For example, the 1949 Project Sign Report was one of the early Air Force military declassified things that came out about the UFO phenomenon.
[03:20:12.250 --> 03:20:19.629]  And what that showed was that there was this central group of intelligence operatives that were really controlling and steering the narrative.
[03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:24.709]  In 1949, in Project Sign, they were pushing the idea of debunking all of this.
[03:20:24.709 --> 03:20:25.489]  It's not real.
[03:20:25.709 --> 03:20:31.110]  But at the same time, MJ-12 was pushing that it's all real and it's all a cover-up.
[03:20:31.190 --> 03:20:42.549]  So you've got two supposed intelligence factions and groups pushing contrary narratives here, that there's real alien visitations, but at the same time, it all needs to be debunked.
[03:20:42.760 --> 03:20:54.700]  And you have people from the intelligence agencies like the OSS, eventually, which would become the CIA, people like Dr. James Lip, people like C.D. Jackson, who was the creator of the doctrinal warfare program.
[03:20:54.700 --> 03:20:59.100]  That was the program designed to utilize Christianity, particularly the Roman Catholic Church.
[03:20:59.800 --> 03:21:05.479]  At the time of Vatican II and before for the CIA and America's designs in other countries.
[03:21:05.479 --> 03:21:12.600]  They wanted to make it an entity engaged in essentially soft power and expressing Americanism to the rest of the world.
[03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:20.040]  And it's interesting that eventually, by the way, the Vatican has kind of given soft okay to the possibility of alien life.
[03:21:20.200 --> 03:21:20.760]  We've had multiple...
[03:21:21.209 --> 03:21:30.209]  I think?
[03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:47.420]  In his doctrinal warfare program, go look that up.
[03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:48.819]  It's a declassified real thing.
[03:21:49.020 --> 03:21:54.139]  He was also involved in the production team on movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still.
[03:21:54.340 --> 03:22:11.190]  Why is the CIA's guy who's in charge of religious engineering and using the churches for CIA projects and for soft power, why is he involved in movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still, these alien narratives that present Jesus,
[03:22:11.530 --> 03:22:26.729]  the alien, is this kind of carpenter from another planet, and he's trying to enlighten the nations to have a socialist world government and dearmament to battle against the other aliens that are coming to destroy us.
[03:22:27.209 --> 03:22:29.190]  The narratives are always the same.
[03:22:29.659 --> 03:22:39.100]  In fact, other production companies at that time, 20th Century Fox, they were putting out a lot of these alien movies, some of the earliest ones.
[03:22:39.239 --> 03:22:44.420]  I think Day of the Earth is still, if I remember, is a 20th Century Fox Zanuck production.
[03:22:44.979 --> 03:22:52.579]  And if you look at what they were doing, they were working at the same time, 20th Century Fox at that time was working with the Office of Wartime Intelligence.
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:58.329]  So it was working with OSS, I think?
[03:23:11.899 --> 03:23:13.159]  Carl Jung, absolutely.
[03:23:13.479 --> 03:23:16.200]  Carl Jung wrote an essay on UFOs.
[03:23:16.260 --> 03:23:17.479]  I remember reading that some years back.
[03:23:17.680 --> 03:23:38.319]  He believed that UFOs, because he thought everything was kind of a projection of the unconscious, that we were sort of manifesting and projecting these things into existence, and that eventually the projections would also reflect back into our psyche, and we would have a sort of changing images of man scenario where we would evolve into some future Gnostic sort of religion or something like that.
[03:23:38.420 --> 03:23:41.559]  So for Carl Jung, they're also a religious phenomenon.
[03:23:42.649 --> 03:23:46.670]  And Carl Jung was a famous Gnostic in terms of his theology.
[03:23:46.829 --> 03:23:59.709]  If you look at his Red Book, which was his sort of like a dream journal, he thought he was getting these channeled messages in his dreams, and he recorded this in this big, giant, rare, esoteric book called The Red Book.
[03:24:00.890 --> 03:24:09.790]  It's all these messages from these beings and these entities, again, very similar to what all the people who claim to channel aliens or to speak to the aliens claim.
[03:24:09.889 --> 03:24:21.389]  They claim that they're getting these messages, they claim that they're getting these vibes from the ether, from the alien sphere, and it's the same stuff that the people who do DMT say.
[03:24:21.729 --> 03:24:28.090]  When the people who do DMT say they talk to the clockwork elves, when they talk to the interdimensional beings, they're saying the exact same thing.
[03:24:28.170 --> 03:24:29.049]  Don't have any kids.
[03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:30.090]  Depopulate.
[03:24:30.629 --> 03:24:31.430]  Emasculate yourself.
[03:24:32.049 --> 03:24:33.190]  Let us have a world government.
[03:24:33.190 --> 03:24:33.709]  We love you.
[03:24:33.729 --> 03:24:35.209]  We're aliens, but also we're demons.
[03:24:35.329 --> 03:24:36.709]  It's all the same stuff, always.
[03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:40.250]  Why do the DMT clockwork elves say the same thing as the aliens?
[03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:46.389]  And they just happen to say the same thing that demons say in the Christian theological system.
[03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:53.649]  Kill your offspring and have a world government and submit to us because we love you and we'll make you feel good, by the way.
[03:24:54.069 --> 03:24:54.969]  But they don't.
[03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:56.709]  They're demonic entities.
[03:24:57.010 --> 03:25:05.750]  And again, every time we look into this story, into this mythos, into this narrative, the people involved in it are the most shady, ridiculous people from the deep state.
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:08.100]  Always, even up until today.
[03:25:08.299 --> 03:25:11.079]  If you go back to the 1980s and 1990s, there was the aviary.
[03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:14.360]  This is a collection of deep state operatives.
[03:25:14.520 --> 03:25:18.079]  Again, Richard Doty, I think, is part of that crew or adjacent to it.
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:24.719]  Colonel John B. Alexander, who's involved in the production and creation of non-lethal weapons technologies.
[03:25:25.139 --> 03:25:27.239]  A bunch of other disinformation operatives.
[03:25:27.379 --> 03:25:39.760]  Again, the Mirage Men, they interview Richard Doty and he literally just gives all the explanations and details of how he lies and deceives the people that they pick to be disinformation operatives in the alien phenomena.
[03:25:40.139 --> 03:25:48.760]  If you come up into the modern period, you have people like Tom DeLonge from Link 182, and he's now in charge of running this Space Kids Academy.
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:52.680]  I don't even know what it is, but he pushes all this alien nonsense.
[03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:57.420]  He goes on all the top podcasts everywhere and tells everybody, oh, the generals have told me the aliens are here.
[03:25:58.459 --> 03:25:59.760]  Generals don't lie, right?
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:01.500]  Although, yeah, the military never lies.
[03:26:01.659 --> 03:26:02.639]  They never engage in deception.
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:05.040]  Surely they're telling us the truth, right?
[03:26:05.620 --> 03:26:06.739]  And what's the message?
[03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:08.979]  Oh, it's always the same New Age nonsense.
[03:26:09.780 --> 03:26:26.340]  So what's obvious is that the same people pushing the Madame Blavatsky theosophy New Age stuff that all the boomers pushed in the 1960 through the Esalen Institute just happens to be the same narrative that the psychonauts push, like Leary and McKenna, that these beings are interdimensional spiritual entities,
[03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:28.579]  and they're here to save us, they're here to help us.
[03:26:28.639 --> 03:26:35.760]  We've got to have a depopulation, eugenics-based scientific dictatorship, or else we won't survive the coming cataclysm.
[03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:41.829]  Now, why is the nuclear stuff always attached to the UFO phenomenon?
[03:26:42.489 --> 03:26:48.190]  I think there's a convenient usage there for the threat.
[03:26:48.450 --> 03:26:53.370]  Everything attached to nuclear stuff is all about the possibility of the world being destroyed, right?
[03:26:53.489 --> 03:26:55.450]  It's a giant cataclysm.
[03:26:55.850 --> 03:27:05.649]  So the way to craft the alien narrative as if the interdimensional beings or entities or whatever might destroy us all is precisely to connect them directly to the nukes.
[03:27:05.809 --> 03:27:17.629]  So supposedly the aliens are always swarming around nuclear facilities because they're going to trigger them and they're going to cause the day after, if you've seen that 1980s.
[03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:25.579]  A famous TV movie that scared all the boomers so that they stopped, dropped, and rolled and got under their desks as if that was going to stop a nuclear blast.
[03:27:26.760 --> 03:27:31.299]  That movie The Day After, right, that sort of burned into the psyche of many.
[03:27:31.399 --> 03:27:33.520]  I mean, I watched it as a kid, so I remember it as well.
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:39.520]  It's terrifying stuff if you grew up as a kid in the 1980s thinking that you're going to get nuked at any moment.
[03:27:39.760 --> 03:27:52.790]  So what better thing to tie the aliens to than the nuclear technology, you know, nuclear energy or whatever, because that immediately gives us the impression that That at any moment, right?
[03:27:52.969 --> 03:28:02.229]  Maybe the aliens are doing reconnaissance in New Jersey, and maybe they're going to attack, and maybe they're going to trigger the nuclear war, which is all, I think, ridiculous.
[03:28:02.569 --> 03:28:09.969]  I mean, if there was anything like that going on, it might be Foreign governments having drones or something like that, but I don't even think that's what's going on in this case.
[03:28:10.129 --> 03:28:17.610]  Remember when supposedly a balloon from China floated over the U.S. a few months ago and everybody was freaking out?
[03:28:17.829 --> 03:28:19.670]  Again, saying it was aliens in that case.
[03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:24.610]  Whenever people see a blimp, they think it's aliens, they think it's a UFO. No, it's not.
[03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:28.610]  It's not a UFO. It's obviously popped.
[03:28:28.930 --> 03:28:33.270]  So, I mean, how are the aliens getting here on air balloons?
[03:28:33.469 --> 03:28:33.989]  I mean, come on.
[03:28:34.350 --> 03:28:38.090]  And why would their spacecraft crash?
[03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:43.209]  Like, if you look at Roswell, it's like, you know, the guy's holding up like tinfoil, right?
[03:28:43.409 --> 03:28:46.290]  So I don't know how they got here in tinfoil, but...
[03:28:46.290 --> 03:28:58.510]  Anyway, the commonality here is the Gnostic, neo-Gnostic mythos and a story that we have to be saved from ourselves.
[03:28:58.889 --> 03:29:01.709]  All the same people who push the global elite stories...
[03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:05.590]  Remember, H.G. Wells is part of the Fabian Society.
[03:29:06.049 --> 03:29:13.809]  The Fabians are all pushing the same type of mythology of, you know, we've got to have a technocratic, centralized, socialist world government.
[03:29:14.069 --> 03:29:15.950]  I mean, that's what all of these people push.
[03:29:16.489 --> 03:29:20.270]  You get later cults that are alien cults, like Scientology.
[03:29:20.729 --> 03:29:24.270]  A lot of people may not know that Scientology is another alien cult.
[03:29:24.450 --> 03:29:38.170]  The actual mythos and story that L. Ron Hubbard made up after he graduated from Aleister Crowley's cult The OTO, which is just an induction technique about how to learn to create your own cult.
[03:29:38.350 --> 03:29:40.229]  Basically, it's a grad school on creating your own cult.
[03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:42.250]  Okay, well, guess what he made up?
[03:29:42.370 --> 03:29:43.270]  An alien cult.
[03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:44.010]  Shocker.
[03:29:44.409 --> 03:29:49.450]  And many of the Crowley circles and people involved in the OTO, they're also all alien believers.
[03:29:49.569 --> 03:29:59.850]  They believe that the real way to contact aliens is through doing hardcore hallucinogens, doing LSD, doing shrooms, doing ayahuasca, etc., etc.
[03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:09.909]  And combine that with so-called ritual magic, etc., and you've got the real way to contact the beings, the entities.
[03:30:10.110 --> 03:30:16.709]  And if you think this is all crazy, you understand that in the 1970s, the CIA was literally studying the occult.
[03:30:16.829 --> 03:30:22.969]  They were studying how to perhaps weaponize and understand scientifically the occult.
[03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:30.030]  I've done multiple live streams and talks on Project Stargate, the remote viewing studies and projects.
[03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:33.409]  I've done a podcast on the gateway process.
[03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:36.069]  We just did one of those a few months ago on my channel.
[03:30:36.209 --> 03:30:46.389]  Go check out my podcast that we did, breaking down the entire gateway process document, which is all about meditation and connecting into other dimensions through meditation.
[03:30:46.530 --> 03:30:49.409]  These are all real CIA studies and projects that are declassified.
[03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:51.930]  So this isn't fake.
[03:30:52.110 --> 03:30:53.590]  This is all real studies.
[03:30:53.750 --> 03:31:03.430]  I'm not saying that all the stuff is real, but the studies that they were doing, again, all ties into religious engineering, all ties into mastering and creating and controlling these various cults.
[03:31:03.610 --> 03:31:15.790]  In fact, if you get into the early phases of NICAP and MUFON, those were very quickly taken over by, if they weren't started, by people from the CIA and various intelligence agencies.
[03:31:23.640 --> 03:31:25.000]  I don't understand why.
[03:31:29.430 --> 03:31:32.489]  Mirage Men, which is one of the best documentaries on this whole topic.
[03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:41.790]  In fact, they even talk about in Mirage Men the very people from Hollywood that they brought in to craft and create some of the so-called famous alien videos.
[03:31:42.069 --> 03:31:50.610]  So a lot of stuff that you see on the internet or on Twitter or whatever, I'm not saying that there aren't people recording drones or recording a real phenomenon at times.
[03:31:50.670 --> 03:31:51.250]  I think there are.
[03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:54.610]  But a lot of these are also famous faked footage.
[03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:57.110]  And Doty talks about that.
[03:31:57.229 --> 03:32:01.950]  I don't know about the one that you see there with the famous ones about DC. I mean, that could be fake.
[03:32:02.069 --> 03:32:02.329]  It could be real.
[03:32:02.450 --> 03:32:02.610]  Who knows?
[03:32:02.729 --> 03:32:06.729]  But I mean, again, I mean, it looks like a B movie, too, from the 1950s as well.
[03:32:06.909 --> 03:32:07.510]  So who knows?
[03:32:07.690 --> 03:32:21.030]  But they talk about in the documentary, in Mirage Men, the ability that they had decades ago to craft pretty good faked alien footage.
[03:32:21.840 --> 03:32:26.879]  And they also talk about, at times, they didn't even have to create something that was that high quality.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:29.379]  They could even do really low-quality stuff.
[03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:36.260]  And if they just brought some dupe to the military base and had a general tell them that this was a real craft and that...
[03:32:36.260 --> 03:32:47.399]  I mean, it's laughable when you watch the documentary because they're actually telling their dupes that, oh, the aliens landed and here's a VHS video of it.
[03:32:47.500 --> 03:32:49.379]  And they want us to...
[03:32:50.780 --> 03:32:53.680]  Make a treaty with them, with the Pleiadians.
[03:32:54.180 --> 03:32:57.860]  But we can't tell the people yet because humans aren't ready for it.
[03:32:57.940 --> 03:33:04.559]  So we need you to be our disseminator and our ambassador to the people of this new alien gospel.
[03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:07.600]  And what's funny about all this is like Wait a minute.
[03:33:07.700 --> 03:33:09.299]  Isn't that the whole plot of X-Files?
[03:33:09.459 --> 03:33:14.100]  If you watch the entire story arc narrative of the show of X-Files, that's literally what's in X-Files.
[03:33:14.280 --> 03:33:22.500]  They actually find people that they have to disseminate the myth through dupes who are the chosen ones.
[03:33:23.459 --> 03:33:31.760]  And even in the X-Files, they even talk about how this is all pretty much run by people from the CIA, people from the OSS, people from the deep state.
[03:33:31.879 --> 03:33:34.040]  And the X-Files is called the syndicate, right?
[03:33:34.159 --> 03:33:36.559]  So all of this is coming out of, quote, the syndicate.
[03:33:37.370 --> 03:33:38.569]  Even in the X-Files.
[03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:40.489]  But no, we're supposed to just believe these people.
[03:33:40.590 --> 03:33:48.969]  So the people who lied and made up weapons of mass destruction stories, they're the ones that are going to be the ones telling us about the alien mythos.
[03:33:49.229 --> 03:33:52.190]  It's kind of like reverse or inverse Kramer.
[03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:58.950]  I don't know if you are familiar with this, but basically anytime Jim Kramer talks about something in terms of economics, the opposite happens.
[03:33:59.149 --> 03:34:02.129]  So if he talks about how good Bitcoin is, Bitcoin goes down.
[03:34:02.290 --> 03:34:04.600]  If he disses Bitcoin, Of course it goes up.
[03:34:04.719 --> 03:34:07.100]  So this is a well-known market phenomenon.
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:09.239]  It's kind of like the same thing I would say here.
[03:34:09.379 --> 03:34:12.680]  Like anything that the establishment is saying, pretty much just believe the opposite.
[03:34:12.819 --> 03:34:16.200]  If they're pushing aliens and the alien mythos, then it's not true.
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:21.540]  It's a pseudo-religious mythology that they're trying to concoct, I would say.
[03:34:21.639 --> 03:34:22.520]  That's the big picture.
[03:34:22.979 --> 03:34:25.719]  In the small term, it's probably what Alex was talking about.
[03:34:25.899 --> 03:34:28.620]  It's a demonstration of drone technology.
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:35.100]  So when Russians are looking at this and what America has going on, they're not thinking about aliens, I guarantee you that.
[03:34:35.260 --> 03:34:40.319]  When the Russians see this, they're saying, okay, America's flexing its drone tech or something.
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:45.239]  It's America showing what they could come do with drones in Russia or something like that.
[03:34:45.299 --> 03:34:46.360]  That makes a lot of sense.
[03:34:46.459 --> 03:34:56.969]  That makes way more sense than the idea that drones have blinking lights like It's ridiculous.
[03:34:58.030 --> 03:35:02.530]  It also doesn't make sense that the craft crash and they happen.
[03:35:02.670 --> 03:35:09.450]  So when the craft crashes, it looks like a tin can Apollo mission type of craft.
[03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:10.450]  It just looks ridiculous.
[03:35:10.649 --> 03:35:11.530]  It looks like a B movie.
[03:35:12.409 --> 03:35:13.889]  But people still believe this.
[03:35:14.129 --> 03:35:22.090]  And why is it, by the way, that all of the famous cults, particularly suicidish cults, they happen to have an alien myth.
[03:35:22.149 --> 03:35:22.790]  Have you noticed this?
[03:35:22.889 --> 03:35:24.670]  There's a big alien mythos behind them.
[03:35:25.049 --> 03:35:26.790]  Not all of them, but for example...
[03:35:27.719 --> 03:35:30.319]  The Heaven's Gate, that was a big alien cult, right?
[03:35:30.399 --> 03:35:33.620]  The Hale-Bopp was like some alien mothership that was going to come.
[03:35:33.799 --> 03:35:37.840]  It was a P-Funk mothership that was going to come take us away, right?
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:49.280]  There's all these Heaven's Gate weirdos, and they literally believed this crazy nonsense with a guy who literally looks like the ultimate alien cult leader, and yet they believed it.
[03:35:49.500 --> 03:35:52.739]  Now, it used the alien myth.
[03:35:53.780 --> 03:35:55.459]  Think about the Raelians.
[03:35:56.340 --> 03:36:06.280]  The Rayelians also supposedly have human cloning technology, and the cult's run by this multi-millionaire former French race car driver.
[03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:07.559]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:36:08.020 --> 03:36:13.399]  And yet, I don't think they're not a suicide cult, but they also believe in aliens and all this nonsense.
[03:36:13.579 --> 03:36:15.459]  They have intelligence connections.
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:18.459]  The Order of the Solar Temple.
[03:36:18.639 --> 03:36:20.879]  That's another literal suicide cult.
[03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:31.260]  Well, they also had an alien mythos because they were blending Crowley and OTO elements into their story and the ascended masters and the gods from the beyond and so forth.
[03:36:31.940 --> 03:36:34.399]  Those are all that you have to contact and channel.
[03:36:34.540 --> 03:36:36.639]  That's another massive giant suicide cult.
[03:36:36.739 --> 03:36:42.440]  People don't know, by the way, that there is actually an alien mythos to Jim Jones' cult.
[03:36:42.829 --> 03:36:51.190]  I mean, it's not the central focus, but Jim Jones would kind of have these weird phases where he would just kind of make up all kinds of wild stuff.
[03:36:51.489 --> 03:37:01.149]  And there's also kind of an alien space opera thing going on in the background of the Jim Jones cult, if you go really deep into all the stuff that he taught over the years.
[03:37:01.489 --> 03:37:13.870]  Now, I don't think it was, again, the main portion of his mythology, because a lot of what Jim Jones was doing was just kind of like liberation theology, Marxism version of so-called, like, Watered down Christianity.
[03:37:14.370 --> 03:37:21.729]  But he would at times talk about, you know, that this universe was created by some kind of entity that was an alien entity that farted it out.
[03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:22.489]  He literally said that.
[03:37:22.569 --> 03:37:23.149]  I'm not making that up.
[03:37:24.270 --> 03:37:26.010]  So again, that's another alien cult.
[03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:28.950]  You could argue that Crowley and his OTO is an alien cult.
[03:37:29.270 --> 03:37:40.569]  In fact, Madame Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, all the New Agers actually believe that the New Age theology and philosophy and theosophy comes from ascended masters who actually are just like aliens, too.
[03:37:40.709 --> 03:37:43.430]  Now, I don't believe that they got that from ascended masters.
[03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:48.110]  I think that was a concocted Fabian socialist made-up religion of the future.
[03:37:48.430 --> 03:37:52.829]  I mean, it is demonic, but I don't really believe that it came from ascended masters.
[03:37:52.989 --> 03:37:58.989]  I think her ascended masters, quote-unquote, were her handlers, the spy chiefs that were really running her.
[03:37:59.239 --> 03:38:07.399]  And if you don't believe that, look up the work of Dr. Richard Spence, who wrote the famous book, Secret Agent 666, about how Aleister Crowley was actually working for British intelligence.
[03:38:07.639 --> 03:38:08.260]  So what do you know?
[03:38:08.319 --> 03:38:15.319]  The most famous proponent of alien theology in the 20th century, also the most famous Satanist of the last century.
[03:38:16.159 --> 03:38:27.260]  Yes, actually, if you go into the studies of what Crowley really talked about, it's not an accident that his channeled lamb entity or being looks just like an alien.
[03:38:27.709 --> 03:38:34.469]  The entity that Aleister Crowley claims to have channeled is like a big, you know, goofy-headed alien.
[03:38:34.809 --> 03:38:46.809]  Just look up LAM, L-A-M. If you have a picture of Crowley's LAM there to the guys in the studio, look up Aleister Crowley's LAM, LAM, and you'll see that it looks just like an alien being.
[03:38:47.170 --> 03:38:55.729]  Again, whether Crowley really channeled anything, whether he was just, you know, bombed out of his mind on various drugs and he saw this entity or did contact, which is possible.
[03:38:56.209 --> 03:39:00.989]  Or whether he just concocted it, it fits very closely into the alien mythos and narrative.
[03:39:01.149 --> 03:39:10.709]  And in fact, some members of that group and of that cult to this day actually do believe that they are channeling and contacting, quote, aliens when they do their rituals.
[03:39:11.530 --> 03:39:28.040]  So whether you believe in the aliens or not, or whether you believe in the H.G. Wells thesis that it's all concocted as a new mythology, Either way, it's abundantly clear that the system, that the establishment is using and concocting and wants this narrative to be there,
[03:39:28.219 --> 03:39:32.879]  not just for the media.
[03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:40.979]  There's Lamb, supposedly, the entity that Aleister Crowley contacted, the demon entity, alien entity.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:48.729]  That becomes really, I think, one of the archetypal images for the future of the The grays or whatever they're supposed to be.
[03:39:48.889 --> 03:39:49.670]  This is all mythology.
[03:39:49.889 --> 03:39:50.889]  It's being engineered.
[03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.690]  It's being created.
[03:39:52.510 --> 03:40:10.790]  And it's not accidental that all of the Mind control CIA doctors and people like that, the psychonauts, are also directly connected to and working with and involved in the crafting and the production of the alien mythos,
[03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:26.180]  whether it's the British intelligence operatives and people like H.G. Wells, people like, you know, Even Elvis Huxley, you could argue, because Huxley in some of his books talks about contacting and interacting with demonic entities through opening these doorways,
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:27.360]  doors of perception and whatnot.
[03:40:28.299 --> 03:40:33.540]  I don't know if he really believed in demons or if he just thought perhaps they were entities.
[03:40:33.959 --> 03:40:37.500]  This is, I think, Ilus in Gaza is the Huxley book that talks about this.
[03:40:37.819 --> 03:40:44.420]  But in Doors of Perception, he does talk about opening up these pathways and these portals, so to speak, through the hallucinogenic experience.
[03:40:46.049 --> 03:40:55.069]  But if you read Doors of Perception, he kind of debates in the book whether it's a purely mental phenomenon or whether you're actually opening up doorways to other dimensions.
[03:40:55.309 --> 03:40:58.030]  So he kind of debates it with himself and perhaps isn't clear.
[03:40:58.149 --> 03:41:06.909]  But regardless, these people actually do believe that the interdimensional beings do interact with our realm and that they do give us information.
[03:41:06.909 --> 03:41:08.370]  They do give us technology.
[03:41:08.370 --> 03:41:12.350]  They do give us creative ideas or something like this.
[03:41:12.969 --> 03:41:14.250]  You could debate that.
[03:41:15.090 --> 03:41:28.229]  It, again, just happens to fit into the Christian theological story of demons who are fallen angels who work to deceive men who appear as angels of light, as Paul says, and who lie to men.
[03:41:28.549 --> 03:41:33.610]  So keep in mind that just because there's a spiritual experience doesn't mean that it's a good spiritual experience.
[03:41:33.709 --> 03:41:34.469]  It might be demonic.
[03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:41.309]  You can find my tickets for my lecture in Florida coming up very soon on my website and on my Twitter.
[03:41:41.549 --> 03:41:43.569]  Follow me on Twitter and get tickets for my Florida lecture.
[03:41:51.940 --> 03:41:59.719]  I've got a very simple but important, powerful, and completely truthful proposal for you.
[03:42:00.569 --> 03:42:02.049]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:42:02.190 --> 03:42:14.729]  Keep our broadcast fighting the globalists at this critical time in history and massively increase your overall health, your vibrancy, your stamina, your libido, everything.
[03:42:15.569 --> 03:42:24.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, sea moss, Irish sea moss specifically, is known as one of the top, if not the top, superfoods on the planet.
