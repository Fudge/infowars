[00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:28.469]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, December 5th, 2024. Trump has officially moved to end the Ukraine war and he's not in office for 44 days.
[00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.090]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.750]  Today.
[00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.729]  If you want to really see something that said, take a look at what happened.
[00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.770]  Yeah, they've come to snuff the rooster.
[00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:21.520]  We now take you live to the year 2024 as a ragtag group of patriots worldwide take action and begin retaking their culture, their families,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.219]  their societies, their souls, their governments.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.860]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.759]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.479]  You're listening to 1776 Reborn!
[00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.979]  Yeah!
[00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.949]  Hang on to the good times!
[00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.969]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.310]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.289]  Alright, Trump has delivered and delivered big.
[00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.169]  It was about 3.15 Central yesterday.
[00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.530]  I was in my office eating my lunch.
[00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.370]  And I had the computer on and I went, let me just see what's trending on X. I haven't checked in 10 minutes.
[00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.050]  Bloop!
[00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.030]  And I saw the headline.
[00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.629]  Speaker Johnson kills 24 billion in funding to Ukraine.
[00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.990]  Says Trump is in command.
[00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.430]  And I went, let me watch that.
[00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.930]  Let me go find the details on what's coming out of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.670]  Spent about 20 minutes researching it and got real happy.
[00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.430]  Because that's exactly what we told you was going on weeks ago, that Trump was going to cut the funding.
[00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:36.509]  He was going to threaten Zelensky that if he didn't get on board with the peace deal before the 20th of January, 2025, now 45 days out, that he would completely cut not just the military funding, but rebuilding funding, everything.
[00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.709]  And Zelensky did not come to the table.
[00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:48.029]  And I was sitting back saying, Trump's got to move on Speaker Johnson, who claims he's on the team, and say, listen here, sonny boy.
[00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.389]  You better block that money.
[00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:54.790]  A lot of money.
[00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.110]  And sure as hell it happened.
[00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:01.589]  So Trump's working behind the scenes and he has now delivered.
[00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:03.129]  Woo!
[00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.550]  Can I get a...
[00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.470]  Can I get a little...
[00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.290]  Little woo!
[00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.209]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.209]  Let us stop talking falsely now.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.399]  The hour's getting late.
[00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.939]  And we are seeing the capitulation by more and more of the servants of Sauron.
[00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.660]  Bill Maher has come out and said, look, we need to give Trump a chance to fix things.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.500]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.899]  The people in control are totally insane.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.959]  They're going to kill everybody.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.699]  We've got to get behind Trump.
[00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.519]  Yeah, you want to survive, don't you, buddy?
[00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:55.509]  We got right up to the edge of total destruction and still may happen, and suddenly you had a little self-preservation instinct left, didn't you, Jack?
[00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.110]  And you admire somebody that's got the guts of Trump, don't you?
[00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.550]  And deep down, you don't want to be with Satan's loser team, sonny boy.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.879]  We've got victory written all over us.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:29.439]  And this broadcast is recognized as the fulcrum, as the headwaters, as the progenitor, as the detonator of what's now happening.
[00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.800]  And no, it's not some promise of utopia and some feather bed that will deliver us to Valhalla.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.079]  We will not be delivered to a state of liberty on a feathered bed, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.240]  But at least we're in the fight, and we've turned the tide, and we're winning.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.860]  And all our enemies know that's not a bluff.
[00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.680]  That's not a confident statement.
[00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.259]  I've been in the trenches for 30-plus years.
[00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.920]  We've come from way behind.
[00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.050]  It was a football game we came from 0-45 behind.
[00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.730]  And now we've got multiple points on the board, surpassing the enemy.
[00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.170]  And now it's time for them to play catch-up.
[00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.430]  And faster and faster and faster and faster the world wakes up.
[00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:26.910]  As they realize how close to total oblivion we were.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.980]  The battle has been joined.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.459]  The globalists declared their undeclared war against us decades and decades and decades ago.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.899]  And now the fight's out in the open.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.079]  And we have accepted the challenge!
[00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:54.399]  It is Thursday, December 5th, 2024. We are 45 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.009]  And we've got massive news for you today.
[00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.550]  Huge guest and more.
[00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:10.490]  But let me just tell you the top stories that we're going to hit in this first hour.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:32.179]  On the heels of Biden's unconditional new type of get-out-of-jail-free card invincibility cloak that he claims he's given Hunter and for all the crimes that he was the bag man for protecting the globalist Obama operation,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.820]  the treason, the money laundering, all of it.
[00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:51.809]  I told you days ago, I said, watch, he'll come out with new preemptive pardons, the first ever, on a first here, for his administration.
[00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:59.049]  I give my entire administration blanket immunity, which will never fly.
[00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:09.649]  And which will fully convict them in even the stupidest, dimmest people's brains for everything they've done.
[00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:19.169]  Politico, of course, reporting yesterday afternoon that Fauci, Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff, and others, oh, it's all of them, Mayorkas, you name it, we told you that weeks ago.
[00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:23.409]  Mayorkas was running around trying to get himself immunity.
[00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:25.929]  They thought they'd never be removed.
[00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.129]  They thought their fraud would go on forever.
[00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.460]  They thought they could steal it again.
[00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:35.559]  But the landslide was too big to stop.
[00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.860]  Too big to rig.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.240]  And that's all on the heels of Trump, as I told you weeks ago.
[00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.759]  And then you saw Tom Homan last weekend.
[00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.200]  The New Borders are saying, no.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.720]  We've got a task force.
[00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:57.500]  And we're going to go after the ground-level human smugglers and sex slavers.
[00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:05.720]  And we're going to then go after the NGOs and the non-providence and the four-providence and the State Department and the UN and the administration officials.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.700]  Drumroll, please.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:28.179]  And then Biden's answer is he'll just do blanket, preemptive, unconditional pardons for the entire crew of Supervillains.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:41.879]  And it won't be like with Trump, with all these Soros-controlled state courts and their little kangaroo events going after crimes that didn't exist.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.980]  With the Democrats, they're all out in the open, on their face, open and shut, prima facie.
[00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:53.240]  And so, even if his omnibus...
[00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:58.149]  Preemptive, unconditional mega pardons.
[00:10:59.169 --> 00:11:02.409]  Somehow, the Supreme Court claims they stand up.
[00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:05.990]  Well, there's more than one way to skin a tyrant.
[00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.870]  Or a cat.
[00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:09.690]  Or a rabbit.
[00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.070]  I hate rabbits.
[00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:13.690]  I hate tyrants.
[00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.870]  To quote a little tyrant, Yosemite Sam.
[00:11:17.789 --> 00:11:18.490]  So...
[00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:21.450]  It's on.
[00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:23.090]  Gloves are off.
[00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.649]  Enemies in free fall.
[00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:25.370]  Collapsing.
[00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:40.690]  As long as we continue on the offense and expose their counter-plans, their counter-offensives, the civil unrest triggered by the massacre of a bunch of migrants, the bombing of a major African-American event,
[00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:56.539]  something along those lines, power outages, they claim the Russians launch, expansion of the wars, Economic collapse, a new virus, and notice they're trying to pull the rug out from the economy right now.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.679]  We'll get into all that.
[00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.519]  They're doing that.
[00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:04.519]  They're hyping up all the new viruses and saying, oh, Trump's going to be avalanched, hit between the eyes.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.539]  All these new pandemics, day one.
[00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:23.720]  Big pharma shill, Peter Hotez warns, a potential pandemics will come crashing down, quote, Crashing down, quote, on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.139]  So they got the economic collapse going.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.679]  They got the new viruses and the fear rolling out.
[00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:39.659]  They've got their guarantees that Trump's going to kill everybody and he's a tyrant and we need to have uprisings because he's coming to arrest us.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.200]  And then when they have the uprisings and Trump's supposed to respond to that constitutionally, well then he's the tyrant.
[00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:50.320]  So the civil unrest, martial law, civil war plan is one.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.480]  Expanding the war with Russia is the other.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.159]  Collapsing the economy is the other.
[00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:56.000]  The viral attack is the other.
[00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:59.860]  And the power outage can be hit in any of those.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.779]  The cyber attack.
[00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.399]  So that's what you got going on.
[00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:07.720]  The civil unrest, martial law blueprint.
[00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:10.919]  The World War III blueprint.
[00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:26.309]  The viral attack blueprint, the economic collapse blueprint, and by the way, as positive as a lot of the news is, the new world order has said, rockets away.
[00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.389]  Launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch.
[00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.269]  They're trying to launch all these babies right now.
[00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:37.179]  And they've done a good job cranking World War III up.
[00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:42.860]  I've got an economist coming on, big stack of them pulling the rug out from under the economy right now, really bad.
[00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:45.200]  They are just everywhere.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.019]  He's going to kill us.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.320]  The military is coming to kill us.
[00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:51.200]  He's going to attack our cities when they're actually about to do the uprising.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.440]  CNN yesterday, I played the clip, said we need to have an uprising.
[00:13:58.299 --> 00:13:58.700]  And...
[00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.870]  The Republican commentator on CNN said, well, that's you doing the uprising.
[00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:05.570]  And then Trump responds to it.
[00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:07.049]  Well, we have to.
[00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.149]  He's coming to get us.
[00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.070]  Remember what Carville said a month ago, right before the election?
[00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.549]  He's coming to kill the black people!
[00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.950]  Armed uprising now!
[00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:15.490]  And he wins!
[00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.129]  Uprising!
[00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.909]  Uprising!
[00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.649]  And the blueprints in the New York Times not accept the inauguration.
[00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:29.120]  Have Western states secede, but they're not going to do it before the inauguration in 45 days.
[00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:36.059]  They're going to let him get in, let Tom Homan go after the human traffickers, have the left come out and protest.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.960]  Somebody attacks the protesters.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.639]  Off to the races.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.899]  And I sit here, looking finally at articles in the conservative news, Red State, Town Hall, others, Saying it doesn't make any sense.
[00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:56.840]  Why are the Democrats saying Trump's coming with the military to kill everybody?
[00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:00.960]  Because they're going to stage false flags, sweetie.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.000]  My God, are you stupid?
[00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.299]  Well, that sounds crazy to say that.
[00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:13.600]  They're saying they're going to have armed uprisings and going to fight the feds.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.659]  And then when those confrontations happen, somebody's going to shoot into the crowd.
[00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:22.840]  I mean, my God, this isn't even one plus one equals two.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.039]  This is like showing a two-year-old color chart and saying, what color is that?
[00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:29.440]  Green?
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.279]  What color is that?
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:30.580]  Blue?
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.360]  What color is that?
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:31.659]  Red?
[00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:32.399]  What color is that?
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:32.740]  Yellow?
[00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:38.539]  What color is that woman on there saying this on CNN of your TV? What color is her dress?
[00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:39.159]  It's green?
[00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:44.940]  The pink spots.
[00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.360]  It's there.
[00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:50.200]  It's their move.
[00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:51.960]  They're doing it.
[00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:56.759]  One of the commentators is like, we need an armed uprising.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.220]  We need an uprising.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.620]  And the Republican, Scott Jenkins, goes, well, you just set an uprising.
[00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:08.220]  Because they're like, we're peaceful, and Trump's going to attack us and kill us and come with the guns.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.659]  And we need to resist that with an armed uprising.
[00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:12.559]  Well, you just called for an uprising.
[00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:22.220]  Well, I mean, it's, again, they're going to start it, stage the events against themselves, to be the victims.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.200]  I mean, this is 101 Jussie Smollett to the 10th power.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:33.659]  And remember all the hand-wringing over Charlottesville, where a car got out of control and one woman died.
[00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:38.429]  Had a bunch of leftist provocateurs on both sides in a stage fight with each other.
[00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:42.450]  I had the head of the Charlottesville white supremacist group on.
[00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:45.610]  Now, just last year, you were a coordinator in Virginia for Obama.
[00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.950]  Well, I no longer support Obama.
[00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.929]  And you could look at the guys with the tiki torches.
[00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:59.350]  It was a giant group of gay dudes dressed up in their little white supremacist outfits.
[00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:01.049]  And I went and looked them up.
[00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.549]  They were like all theater majors with theater degrees.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.700]  The main campaign group in Virginia for Obama previously.
[00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:16.420]  I mean, you know, a bunch of gay dudes with theater majors.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.099]  I mean, it never ends, man.
[00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:23.799]  You go to a white supremacist rally, it's all gay dudes dressed up like Nazis.
[00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:24.660]  It's ridiculous.
[00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:26.039]  What do you think Patriot Front is?
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.079]  It's a gay cult.
[00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:30.579]  Just saying.
[00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:33.660]  That's how they discredit us.
[00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:35.740]  Bunch of gay dudes dress up and say they're Nazis.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.339]  They catch them all the time.
[00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.240]  They did it to Rand Paul.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.880]  He's running for Senate.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.119]  Remember?
[00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:44.400]  A bunch of gay staffers dressed up like Nazis and said they were for him.
[00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:48.519]  Then they went and just did Google facial recognition and said, oh, here's all these staffers.
[00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:50.059]  And I went, hey, check and see if they're gay.
[00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:50.940]  Oh, they are.
[00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:51.980]  I mean, just a fact.
[00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:55.720]  The gay dudes get together and say, how do we stop this?
[00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:56.779]  Well, let's dress up like Nazis.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.799]  We're all theater majors anyway.
[00:17:57.819 --> 00:17:58.700]  Let's go out and do it.
[00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.200]  There go the gay dudes.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.279]  The gay right-wing Nazi army that's actually leftist.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.740]  So, well, they keep getting our faces and learning we're gay Democrat staffers.
[00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:13.319]  We'll wear masks this time.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.579]  Come on.
[00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:18.799]  Afterwards, we'll have a big party.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.299]  Oh, yeah.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.700]  Stupid.
[00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:23.220]  We shouldn't have not worn masks.
[00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:24.420]  Well, this time we don't.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.019]  We'll get a few right-wing idiots who won't know who we are.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.880]  Plus, those right-wing guys are sexy.
[00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.849]  So, that's where you are at.
[00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:42.250]  It's the Governor Whitmer kidnapping plot times a thousand using gay theater students.
[00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.509]  Okay, so you got that.
[00:18:47.089 --> 00:18:50.690]  And then, of course, you have the big, giant, mega-juicy enchilada.
[00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.130]  Let's put the live show headline up there for everybody, please.
[00:19:01.269 --> 00:19:05.430]  Trump has been silent since he was president-elect on November 6th.
[00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:22.950]  And then yesterday, I've been saying this for weeks, he's put pressure on Mike Johnson, [...] Speaker of the House, to say, do not, do not, do not give that additional $24 billion to Zelensky.
[00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.470]  Zelensky is refusing to announce a preemptive ceasefire, which Putin says he will instantly accept.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.240]  Until Trump gets into office in 45 days.
[00:19:32.599 --> 00:19:38.579]  And then we can end this dangerous nuclear war fiasco.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.119]  And by the way, you now have the official head of the British military saying we're in World War III and the West is at war with Russia.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.660]  Told you that was forthcoming.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.160]  That was today.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.400]  Got that article right here.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.420]  So...
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.079]  This is huge.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.700]  Johnson, no Ukraine aid on year-end spending stopgap.
[00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:07.119]  Let's put the live show headline back up.
[00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:09.349]  Breaking now.
[00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:16.130]  Trump moves to end Ukraine war by blocking deep state's attempt to send an additional 24 billion to Zelensky.
[00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:27.730]  Plus, Biden prepares preemptive pardons in desperate attempt to stop 47's plan to prosecute outgoing administration for human trafficking, sex slavery, and COVID crimes.
[00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:43.579]  That is a must-watch, must-listen, must-share feed at realalexjonesonthemightyx and at theintrepiddauntlessinfowars.com forward slash show.
[00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:49.059]  And then there's band.video, the live feeds as well.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.359]  Hit your email list, hit your text message list, share it randomly everywhere like your future depends on it because it does.
[00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.480]  We are winning.
[00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.640]  We know the enemy's counter-offensive plans.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.579]  We have their number.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.279]  We have their name.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.559]  We have their ass!
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.900]  But we have all these Republican headlines.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.700]  Here's Red State.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.039]  Scott Jennings rolls CNN up in a blanket.
[00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:18.339]  Stomps out their lies when panel says Trump may shoot Americans.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.279]  But that's not the question.
[00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:23.700]  Why are they everywhere with that talking point?
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.500]  Riddle me this, Batman.
[00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:37.819]  And Batman would say, because you and the Joker are planning to stage attacks on the innocent public and blame me.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.859]  Exactly, Batman!
[00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:42.039]  But you'll never be able to warn them.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.359]  Because you don't have a TV show reaching 50 million people a day.
[00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.880]  But we do.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.240]  And 50 million is a conservative number.
[00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:58.000]  You get excited.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.579]  You share the clips of this later.
[00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.079]  We reach 100, 200 million.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.920]  And look, Trump knows this.
[00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:03.660]  People know this.
[00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:08.940]  But they need to be constantly poked lovingly.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:17.119]  The squeaky wheel gets the grease to say, hey, I want you to come out and announce you're going to indict the administration for human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:17.900]  They've done that.
[00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:19.599]  That's popular.
[00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:20.500]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:22.039]  It'll devastate the enemy.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.160]  It'll get them on total defense, off balance, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.640]  And they're doing it.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.140]  And cut off the funding through Mike Johnson.
[00:22:38.259 --> 00:22:39.140]  They've done it.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.720]  These are all the moves that need to be made.
[00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:49.079]  And let's just say Trump doesn't need us running around screaming this is what needs to be done.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:59.680]  Some of the minions around him that are trying to give him bad advice, the pussies, the losers, need to be shouted down.
[00:23:01.049 --> 00:23:03.910]  And the general public needs to know what the hell's going on.
[00:23:04.089 --> 00:23:05.750]  And that's why we're here.
[00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:07.170]  And I'm going to say it again.
[00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:10.250]  Only way this dog hunts is you let it out.
[00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:13.829]  You are in command.
[00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.769]  You have the initiative.
[00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:18.609]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.650]  You are the resistance.
[00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:22.549]  You are victory.
[00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.069]  Action is victory.
[00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:27.089]  Resistance is victory.
[00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.009]  Truth is victory.
[00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.250]  Now take victory in your hands.
[00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:39.630]  Or be completely enslaved by psychotic devil worshippers that want to cut all your son's penises off.
[00:23:41.509 --> 00:23:46.789]  And engulf the surface of the planet in nuclear hellfire.
[00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.289]  Wow, reality is pretty sensational, isn't it?
[00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.630]  Beyond epic.
[00:23:53.509 --> 00:23:58.410]  Because reality is always more amazing than fiction.
[00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:08.990]  Truth is always more fantastical than fiction.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.799]  Words cannot describe the magic moment we're in.
[00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:18.740]  That magic moment.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.640]  Let's come in with the Misfits magic moment next segment.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.940]  All right.
[00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.309]  Another big weight got lifted off of me cutting that Ukraine funding off.
[00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.390]  That is a big, big deal.
[00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:46.670]  That is Trump putting his testicles on the table against the deep state, against the globalists, against the new world order, against all of them.
[00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:59.190]  That's what you do when you want to end this war that could destroy the planet and is bankrupting us and is being used by the Democrats to launder that money back to themselves, to run all their covert operations against the American people.
[00:25:00.069 --> 00:25:13.670]  You expose them, you cut off their little pet war, and then you begin prosecuting their ass because they deserve it, and so they can't commit crimes again, and because if you don't, they are going to kill the president.
[00:25:14.049 --> 00:25:18.390]  They are going to continue to attack me and everybody else.
[00:25:21.849 --> 00:25:25.809]  We have to crush them legally and lawfully, constitutionally.
[00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.910]  We must do what must be done.
[00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:38.730]  And we must show mercy to ourselves and to our children and to our future.
[00:25:39.569 --> 00:25:41.289]  It's not showing them mercy.
[00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:48.289]  We have to show ourselves mercy by admitting the scum we're up against and admitting how evil they are.
[00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:55.289]  And then not aiding and abetting them by little half measures and little pats on the cookie head.
[00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.049]  You little cookie, you go away and be nice to me.
[00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:01.150]  They're not gonna be nice.
[00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.769]  They're not gonna stop.
[00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:03.730]  They want us dead.
[00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:15.130]  The energy of humanity has never been brighter.
[00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.650]  I can feel your strength!
[00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:23.809]  Yes, stay with me.
[00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:26.910]  There is a big sale going on right now.

[00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:53.309]  Then that ends.

[00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.470]  That's insane.
[00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:18.230]  That's why the owner of the company was here last week, and he said, Alex, you say we do too many discounts.
[00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.369]  Sometimes they're not enough profit.
[00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.450]  He goes, we're really going to hate this.
[00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.069]  Yeah.

[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.480]  People see how my skin glows, so much energy.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.460]  It's just amazing.
[00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:48.789]  We're good to go.
[00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:55.359]  Even if the bad guys are able to get InfoWars, they have no claim on that.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.440]  It will continue on as our sponsor at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:27:57.859 --> 00:28:00.039]  So now is the time to take action.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.519]  The Alex Jones gear, the Patriot gear, the 1776 gear.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:10.660]  I'd put it in Trump gear, Alex Jones InfoWars gear, and Patriot 1776 Founding Father type stuff.
[00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.779]  That's my favorite gear.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.099]  And funny, the stuff I like the best is the best selling.
[00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:16.420]  It goes Patriot gear, Alex Jones gear.
[00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:17.599]  It's the same thing, but you know...
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.940]  With my self-renforce on it.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.039]  And then the Trump gear.
[00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:23.980]  And these are great, it's great Trump gear, but quite frankly, the Trump, that shirt's really popular right there.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.059]  Trump, better coverage than Verizon, now do you hear us.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.680]  But no, the Trump gear is the least popular category.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.259]  People like the anti-New World Order, pro-America stuff.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:33.880]  That's...
[00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.569]  That's what I guess would be most popular.
[00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.410]  That's what's most popular.
[00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.450]  I would think Team Humanity would be very popular.
[00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.890]  It's not.
[00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:41.049]  That's what we are on show.
[00:28:41.349 --> 00:28:45.430]  And then as I said, also all those other specials and more.

[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.160]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:25.859]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.559]  I'm your host.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.500]  We have massive guests joining us.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.119]  Victor Boot, top Russian expert on what's happening in the war with the latest developments there.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.680]  Dr. Judy Mikovits and others today.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.200]  But right now I'm getting into the top news.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.619]  So I'm doing a little bit of celebration there earlier.
[00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:46.279]  Let me drill right into it right now.
[00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:54.119]  You had Speaker Mike Johnson, who I don't trust as far as I can throw him, but Trump's on top of him right now.
[00:29:54.339 --> 00:30:04.119]  We know Trump's been in detente and negotiations with Putin, Zelensky, and others since the day after he was president-elect, saying, I want a peace deal, I want to cease fire.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.039]  Or I'm going to cut all the funding off Ukraine when I get in.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.480]  And I was saying, put pressure on Johnson now, kill the funding.
[00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:16.299]  Said that on air, made phone calls to the high levels of the Trump camp.
[00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:18.539]  They said, obviously, Jones, we're already on that.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:18.900]  Yes.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.660]  It's like when I was telling General Flynn three weeks ago, I go, we need to have the task force.
[00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:25.220]  I said this on November 7th.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.839]  Go after the NGOs, go after the administration.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.859]  And he's like, yeah, it's being done.
[00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:31.670]  Okay, good.
[00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:33.769]  Then we saw Tom Homan announce it last Saturday.
[00:30:34.289 --> 00:30:36.809]  And the globalists are crapping bricks.
[00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:45.490]  They're trying to do preemptive blanket unconditional pardons.
[00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:47.690]  And I'll get into that in a moment.
[00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:51.069]  But they are totally guilty.
[00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.190]  They've done all this out in the open just thinking they were invincible.
[00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:58.410]  The human trafficking, the disappearing kids on purpose, the slave labor, the sex slavery.
[00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:00.569]  I mean, we've got their butt on that.
[00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.460]  Like, where are the kids?
[00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:03.259]  We're going to find them.
[00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.480]  Homan says they're going to do that.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:10.880]  I mean, imagine when all of that is trotted out in front of everybody and not swept under the rug.
[00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:15.460]  It's over for the Democratic Party if we press the attack.
[00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:18.160]  And the children are still in slavery.
[00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:19.099]  They've still been disappeared.
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.019]  The women, you name it.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.059]  We must do it.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.519]  And so, I said weeks ago, I said, you watch, Biden's going to try to...
[00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.650]  Give preemptive pardons.
[00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:30.549]  I use that term.
[00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.549]  Nobody's ever done that.
[00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:35.069]  To just say it doesn't matter what the crime is or what you try to charge or what you try to do.
[00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:36.230]  It's just a blanket.
[00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.829]  You can commit any crime ever you want before this pardon.
[00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:42.549]  Kelly might try a new thing where he says into the future.
[00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.849]  I mean, that's not going to hold up.
[00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.049]  That's totally unconstitutional.
[00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:51.869]  But these crimes also don't have statute of limitations.
[00:31:52.170 --> 00:32:09.960]  I'm going to get some constitutional lawyers on about it, but I can tell you right now, That you can have the congressional investigations, you can bring it all out that will politically destroy them, and then you hand those investigations over to the state attorney generals and over to the local district attorneys and county attorneys, and then in the states where the crimes were committed,
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.519]  and then you indict the living hell.
[00:32:13.579 --> 00:32:16.259]  Remember, federal pardon's only good for federal crimes.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:24.519]  You indict Mayorkas, you indict Joe Biden, you indict Kamala Harris, you indict, you indict, you indict.
[00:32:24.819 --> 00:32:28.000]  And the public will be behind this because these are real crimes.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:34.460]  This isn't made-up stuff, you know, 25 years ago in a New York department store.
[00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:39.480]  This isn't, oh, made-up stuff, Mar-Lago's only worth $18 million, you lied and said $200 million.
[00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:42.039]  And then current estimates are almost a billion.
[00:32:42.339 --> 00:32:45.240]  This isn't, oh, in the Fannie...
[00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:56.309]  Willis' indictment in Georgia and Atlanta, in the indictment, he said that the election was stolen and that's disinformation, so you're indicted for that.
[00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.089]  Well, it turns out he was right.
[00:32:58.089 --> 00:33:02.329]  It was worse than what Trump said, as we learn more, but it was exactly what he said and then worse.
[00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:05.049]  But he could have been wrong and said there's election fraud.
[00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.849]  That's his right.
[00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:08.569]  Democrats do it all the time.
[00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:15.369]  So those weren't real crimes and people saw that and it made them mad.
[00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:21.690]  But what Biden and Mayorkas and all the rest of them have done, oh, that's cut and dry.
[00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.950]  And so you have to go after them.
[00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:34.670]  And I would expect, I mean, he's going to try to do this magic wand, get out of jail free card thing for everybody.
[00:33:35.829 --> 00:33:38.950]  We did call this and they've done it.
[00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.349]  What else are they supposed to do?
[00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.130]  They are cornered rats.
[00:33:43.309 --> 00:33:43.710]  Loathsome.
[00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:53.730]  Biden regime reportedly considering preemptive pardons for several of Trump's enemies, including Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff, and Anthony Fauci.
[00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:55.890]  It's all of them.
[00:33:56.289 --> 00:33:57.109]  Mayorkas, you name it.
[00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:04.589]  Well, Liz Cheney was part of a fake committee, violated federal law, was not approved by the Republicans under law, didn't get to put their people on it.
[00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:11.570]  And then they destroyed all of the interviews and all the depositions with yours truly and others.
[00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:21.420]  And the tapes and everything, because they were using it as a dragnet to cover up what they'd done and then falsely frame others.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.940]  So that's why you get her.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:32.739]  Adam Schiff, all the massive crimes he committed on that committee as well, falsifying emails, putting false documents in, all the other crap he did.
[00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.579]  Working to pay foreign governments to create fake dossiers.
[00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:37.159]  Fauci.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.679]  Lying about gain of function.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.599]  Lying to Congress.
[00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:41.679]  Saying they weren't producing the virus at Wuhan.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.619]  All came out in documents they created at Chapel Hill years before.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.860]  Moving to Wuhan so they could try to blame China.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.639]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.480]  Don't like the Hunter Biden pardon?
[00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:56.239]  Wait till Joe pardons himself.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.900]  Oh yeah, that's coming.
[00:35:01.909 --> 00:35:03.809]  Biden weighs preemptive pardons.
[00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:09.969]  How Biden can make pardons a stamp on his legacy.
[00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.670]  Biden White House weighs preemptive pardons for potential Trump targets.
[00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:16.949]  Biden admin lawyers up.
[00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.449]  Republicans threaten Mayorkas.
[00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.250]  Mayorkas articles is running around trying to get immunity for himself.
[00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.289]  Not so arrogant now, buddy boy.
[00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:30.289]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.260]  And you've got Biden White House is considering pardoning Fauci.
[00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:44.659]  Biden's team is reportedly discussing preemptive pardons to protect certain people from being targeted by the Trump administration.
[00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:48.739]  Names on the list include Fauci, Adam Schiff, Liz Cheney.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:56.380]  According to the outlet, the West Wing deliberations have been organized by the White House counsel Ed Siskel.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.519]  But include a range of other aides, including Chief of Staff Jeff Zintz.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:15.360]  Political reported Senator Rand Paul previously filed a criminal referral, two of them, over Fauci's contradictory claims about the origins of COVID. For his dishonesty, frankly, he should go to prison.
[00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:21.280]  If you lie to Congress and you're dishonest, then you won't accept responsibility for the mistake in judgment.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.199]  Mistake in judgment.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:32.280]  He should just be pilloried He should never be accepted, Paul said during a radio interview.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.760]  So, it's a big deal.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.679]  And it's the right thing to do.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.019]  Or you aid and embed these people, you become just as guilty as them if you're in power and you let them do it.
[00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.780]  And then you leave these criminals running around free.
[00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:53.159]  They will do what they claim Trump is going to do to them.
[00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:57.269]  No, we're not coming after you for non-crimes, son.
[00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.650]  You are psychotic megalomaniacs that are a danger to everyone.
[00:37:03.769 --> 00:37:05.530]  I got a CNN clip here.
[00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:08.590]  We're going to play in a moment.
[00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:16.570]  They can investigate you into bankruptcy, torture you in the FBI investigation, says CNN about Trump.
[00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:21.789]  But that's what they've been doing.
[00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.730]  Oh my gosh, they'll do lawfare.
[00:37:23.849 --> 00:37:25.030]  Oh my gosh, they'll indict us.
[00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.309]  Oh my gosh, they'll bankrupt us.
[00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:31.829]  What do you think they've been doing to everybody that's an American patriot with made-up show trials?
[00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.570]  But we don't need to make stuff up on you.
[00:37:36.849 --> 00:37:41.469]  It's like catching fish in a barrel.
[00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:53.510]  But before I get to that clip from CNN... I want to get into Johnson and Ukraine, and we'll delve into this more next hour with Victor Boot.
[00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.630]  No Ukraine aid on year-end spending stopgap.
[00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:08.590]  And I've been told, and told you this weeks ago, that Trump is telling Johnson, you kill the next spending package if Zelensky doesn't declare a ceasefire.
[00:38:10.969 --> 00:38:15.469]  And again, most of that money comes back to the left and back to the neocons and back to Mitch McConnell.
[00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:21.079]  That's why they've been just flooding money to Ukraine.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:29.260]  And so that's a big deal that Trump, through Johnson, has killed further funding as he said he would do.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.860]  And that's going to get Zelensky and his controller's attention very, very fast.
[00:38:34.019 --> 00:38:38.320]  So good job, Trump, following through on what he pledged to do.
[00:38:39.159 --> 00:38:42.719]  And actions do speak louder than words.
[00:38:43.719 --> 00:38:44.679]  And so...
[00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:49.030]  I've been saying I want to see major action from Trump.
[00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.349]  I've gotten very concerned.
[00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.829]  But he's got a lot of reasons for the things he's doing, and I understand it.
[00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:58.570]  And so, Trump came through.
[00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:00.409]  And I expect to see more of this.
[00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:04.969]  And he's coming through on the plans to indict the administration officials for human trafficking and sex slavery?
[00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:06.829]  And slave labor?
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.900]  And he's getting ready to shut that border down.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.579]  He's getting ready to cut energy prices by half, which he can easily do.
[00:39:15.099 --> 00:39:20.659]  That will put a major dent in inflation and put a lot of money in your pockets.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.619]  And that's the big news coming up later.
[00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:27.960]  Big stack on them pulling the rug out.
[00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:29.179]  Zero Hedge breaks it down well.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.239]  I mean, they are pulling the rug out on everything, on Trump and the American people.
[00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:37.150]  So that's how they'd counter him.
[00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:48.909]  I said, crash the economy, start a big war, stage false flags, try to have a civil war, say Trump's a dictator, launch a cyber attack, launch a new virus, and they got it all going.
[00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:55.309]  You missed yesterday's show, Hotez, because Fauci's so discredited, he now is the official mouthpiece, they admit that.
[00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:57.489]  Of the UN and the globalists.
[00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.090]  And he's like, there's dozens of new viruses.
[00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.849]  You can't stop them.
[00:39:59.909 --> 00:40:00.710]  It'll crush Trump.
[00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:02.070]  It's coming down on him.
[00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:03.809]  We'll get him.
[00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:05.130]  A little supervillaining it.
[00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.869]  He said it'll come crashing down on January 1st on Trump administration.
[00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:08.409]  That's a quote.
[00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.269]  Play the clip coming up again.
[00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.829]  So this is seismic.
[00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:22.150]  But we're not going to be caught flat-footed with their agenda this time.
[00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:30.599]  We're already not flat-footed, but we can get on a sure stance with them and really make sure them trying to pull this crap blows up in their faces.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.099]  I'm not hearing enough talk about this.
[00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:37.719]  Or Republicans are in the news going, what are you just randomly saying?
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.920]  We're going to go kill the migrants and have martial law.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:48.400]  We're going to have an uprising and take over and throw him out and we're going to secede states and don't you dare try to stop us because that's Hitler.
[00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:51.400]  The Republicans are like, this doesn't make sense.
[00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.519]  What do you mean it doesn't make sense?
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.059]  They have an official Democrat battle plan from 2020 if Trump could have overridden the fraud to trigger exactly what you're seeing them do now.
[00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:02.760]  So they're going to their fallback plan.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:09.800]  My God, it's a frickin' battle plan in the New York Times from the DNC war game.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.920]  They said they'd do that.
[00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:13.880]  Now they're doing it.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.800]  My God, you got their frickin' playbook.
[00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:18.690]  I want to explain something.
[00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.650]  I'm not up here telling you I think this.
[00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:23.869]  The damn play is being run.
[00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.889]  I'm like a football coach, and I've got the other team's playbook, and I see the formation.
[00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.010]  I go, it looks like this.
[00:41:30.269 --> 00:41:31.190]  This is me months ago.
[00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.230]  It looks like they're going to run this play.
[00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.090]  They're now in motion.
[00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.530]  Hut, hut, hut, snap.
[00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:38.250]  Oh, yeah, they're doing the play.
[00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.710]  They are now executing on it.
[00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:49.349]  And I see headlines, finally some headlines, people going, why are they doing this?
[00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:50.170]  Makes no sense.
[00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:51.750]  We're not going to kill the migrants.
[00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:54.949]  They're going to kill them and blame us.
[00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:59.070]  I just, I don't understand why this is so simple to me.
[00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.650]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.889]  And are we just going to sit here and take this?
[00:42:05.849 --> 00:42:07.289]  We have their ass in check.
[00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:08.550]  We're about to checkmate them.
[00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:12.969]  And they've got five moves that I just detailed over and over again.
[00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.969]  And we need to psychologically inoculate people to what's going down.
[00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:30.610]  If an enemy's sneaking up at night to attack your fortress, your castle, would it be better to have a scout that was posted out at the pass two miles away to see the enemy who could run back and tell us, hey, I see thousands of troops marching.
[00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:32.789]  Looks like they'll be here in about an hour.
[00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.409]  Get ready and to raise the alarm.
[00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:45.260]  Or is it better to everybody asleep in the fortress with only a few sentries out when the enemy attacks with their ladders and siege equipment and come running out trying to take the walls?
[00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:51.380]  Would you like to be waiting for them and ready with your archers politically?
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.280]  Or do you want to be in bed when they start climbing the walls?
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.099]  Okay, I think you know the answer.
[00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.070]  So let's go to the clip of Johnson.
[00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.030]  Here it is on the cutting of $24 billion.
[00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:10.690]  It's not going to the Democrats through their money lining operation.
[00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:11.570]  Here it is.
[00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:19.650]  Last week, the Biden administration requested to attach the upcoming CR additional aid to Ukraine, $24 billion.
[00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.429]  Do you plan to do that?
[00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:22.230]  What is your prediction?
[00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:23.429]  I'm not planning to do that.
[00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.809]  There are developments by the hour in Ukraine.
[00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:37.039]  I think, as we predicted, and as I said to all of you, Weeks before the election, if Donald Trump is elected, it will change the dynamic of the Russia war on Ukraine.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.500]  And we're seeing that happen.
[00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:41.659]  So it is not the place of Joe Biden to make that decision now.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.400]  We have a newly elected president, and we're going to wait and take the new commander-in-chief's direction on all of that.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.099]  So I don't expect any Ukraine funding to come up now.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.360]  By the way, it's a whole other subject.
[00:43:53.519 --> 00:43:58.840]  But again, it's not that I don't just trust Weasel, but Trump's got him under his control right now.
[00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:11.579]  Congressman Ron Paul, former Congressman Dr. Paul, says that a massive 300,000 APAC ad push against Representative Thomas Massey in Kentucky, green-lined by Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.
[00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:18.570]  The Republican Party is at war with itself and willing to shut down its members on spurious charges of bigotry.
[00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:24.889]  Also today, U.S. Army Major of Jewish background resigns over Biden's Gaza policy.
[00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:31.010]  Finally, a Republican rep from Florida drops a bill to impeach Biden for withholding weapons from Israel.
[00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:32.469]  Watch below.
[00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:48.349]  But the big takeaway here is, Johnson is allowing AIPAC and other foreign lobbying bodies To target people like Massey and Senator Paul who aren't anti-Israel.
[00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.969]  Israel's richer than us per capita.
[00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.150]  I mean, good Lord.
[00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.190]  Israel, give me a bunch of money.
[00:44:55.969 --> 00:44:57.090]  Give me some money.
[00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.690]  We're going bankrupt over here.
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.329]  $37 trillion debt.
[00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:07.789]  I'm against all foreign military aid.
[00:45:07.949 --> 00:45:08.710]  Always have been.
[00:45:11.469 --> 00:45:17.250]  And AIPAC's going after Massey for saying, no money for you.
[00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.110]  My God!
[00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.789]  You know, it's like King Charles is taken care of by the British taxpayer.
[00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:23.889]  The guy's one of the richest men on Earth.
[00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:33.349]  Old women can't get their little gas alarm so they don't freeze to death in the UK. But this guy's giving tens of billions of dollars for his frickin' palaces.
[00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:35.309]  I don't want to give money to King Charles.
[00:45:35.909 --> 00:45:37.469]  Not against the British people.
[00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:39.510]  Disgusting!
[00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:49.389]  So, knock it off, AIPAC. Disgusting behavior.
[00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:55.489]  And I'm sure AIPAC will run ads against Ron Paul now.
[00:45:55.809 --> 00:45:57.409]  Just, you know, please, God.
[00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.389]  We can go knock on an AIPAC member's door and say, I want $1,000.
[00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:03.769]  Take care of me, you're a racist.
[00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:09.929]  It's like, it's not like Israel's poor, right?
[00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.150]  Okay, I'm going to turn that around.
[00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.070]  I want some money from Israel.
[00:46:13.869 --> 00:46:15.630]  I want some money from King Charles.
[00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:18.750]  The Brits ought to be saying that.
[00:46:18.889 --> 00:46:20.949]  Like, hey, no more money for you, buddy.
[00:46:21.969 --> 00:46:22.250]  Alright.
[00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.889]  We're going to come back and really focus on the Russia situation.
[00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.909]  Big developments I haven't even gotten to on that front.
[00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.110]  Oh my gosh, I've got so much Russian news here.
[00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.070]  It's making my head...
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.840]  So that's coming up with Victor Booth for about 30 minutes.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.699]  Then Dr. Mikovic on the huge COVID poison news.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.239]  All these prestigious studies.
[00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:56.119]  Oxford, Harvard, the big medical journals.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.800]  It's full of concentrated cancer viruses on purpose.
[00:47:00.639 --> 00:47:01.960]  That's all coming up.
[00:47:03.909 --> 00:47:07.190]  Well, look at how they're pulling the rug out from the American people and Trump and the economy.
[00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:08.269]  Big stacks on that.
[00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:10.690]  This is all going to be vital information.
[00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:13.650]  And remember, a lot of you already know all this.
[00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:14.849]  Well, that's why you're Paul Revere.
[00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.250]  It's to move the ball forward.
[00:47:16.469 --> 00:47:17.389]  Take the live links.
[00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:18.110]  Take the live feeds.
[00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:18.809]  Real Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.429 --> 00:47:22.050]  Share those on your email list, your text message list by word of mouth.
[00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:25.710]  Share them all over X. Share them all over X. Take clips out of what you think is most important.
[00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:26.309]  Re-upload it.
[00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:31.190]  You're all having a giant effect, and I salute and I thank you all, but this is an information war.
[00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:41.250]  The local radio station you're listening to, tell folks when you walk in, 7-Eleven or Circle K or Safeway or to your office, say, hey, Alex Jones is on that forbidden show.
[00:47:41.909 --> 00:47:44.849]  The guy that's going to write about a lot of stuff, he's really covering important stuff right now.
[00:47:44.909 --> 00:47:45.710]  Let me send you the link.
[00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.170]  Hey, check this out.
[00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.289]  That's how we move the ball down the field.
[00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:50.929]  That is so vital, so keep doing it.
[00:47:51.789 --> 00:47:58.969]  And separately, as you know, I'm funded by you, the people, the American people, and others that support us.
[00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:00.070]  We ship all over the world.
[00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:03.130]  Go to our great sponsor, not owned by Infowars, not owned by me.
[00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.550]  So even the bad guys shut Infowars down.
[00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:05.389]  There's a big hearing Monday.
[00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.869]  It could happen.
[00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:06.889]  Pray it doesn't.
[00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:09.289]  We're going to continue on the Alex Jones Network.
[00:48:09.949 --> 00:48:15.929]  So, thealexjonesstore.com funds InfoWars, it keeps on the air, and the backup operations and what we're doing.
[00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.170]  Incredible supplements, incredible Patriot Year.

[00:48:19.949 --> 00:48:21.250]  Some of the very best designs anywhere.
[00:48:21.489 --> 00:48:23.670]  But Ultimate CMOS is what you really want.
[00:48:24.269 --> 00:48:29.030]  It is full of the most powerful, organic, bioavailable iodine that is the missing link in the body.
[00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:33.230]  It's got 90 plus vitamins and minerals in it that are concentrated.
[00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.469]  The whole thing is insane for your immune system, your libido, your stamina, everything.
[00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.710]  Ultimate CMOS and the discounts are the biggest ever.
[00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:44.750]  On top of the regular sales, 30 to 40% off on different items on the site.

[00:48:56.429 --> 00:48:56.869]  Stay with us.
[00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.750]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:03.989]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:49:05.039 --> 00:49:07.340]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.940]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:15.960]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.440]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:25.739]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[00:49:26.039 --> 00:49:27.139]  We're going to be very transparent.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.260]  We're going to get behind.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.679]  What did the United Nations have to do with the whole border crisis?
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.440]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:37.690]  We're going to be very transparent American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:39.170]  Again, by design.
[00:49:39.329 --> 00:49:40.829]  And so much more has happened.
[00:49:40.929 --> 00:49:41.869]  This is an exciting time.
[00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:44.070]  But the globalists are striking back.
[00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:48.150]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[00:49:48.269 --> 00:49:50.130]  And we can't do it without you.
[00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.090]  So we make it easy.
[00:49:51.289 --> 00:49:57.429]  Go to thealexshownstore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere.
[00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.210]  To spread the word, to meet like-minded people.
[00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:01.190]  And support the Infoward.
[00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:10.670]  Now, the folks at Bigly that power the AlexJoeStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.289]  And I personally love this one.
[00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:15.989]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.449]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:19.769]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.889]  And this will horrify me.
[00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.650]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and fearing and walking on the street.
[00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:27.329]  Say, it's okay.
[00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:32.429]  Alex Jones doesn't fight, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:39.070]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[00:50:39.289 --> 00:50:42.530]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.

[00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.889]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.

[00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:04.909]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[00:53:04.909 --> 00:53:06.030]  What an amazing aircraft.
[00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.690]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[00:53:07.769 --> 00:53:08.510]  Thanks for the support.
[00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.019]  I love you, Alex.
[00:53:10.199 --> 00:53:12.320]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:12.920]  Thanks, Chris.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.119]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[00:53:18.119 --> 00:53:19.280]  I never imagined I'd be.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.260]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:20.960]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:53:21.199 --> 00:53:23.500]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[00:53:23.579 --> 00:53:23.980]  It is.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:24.480]  Yes.
[00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:25.159]  Oh, thank you.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.480]  The listeners are amazing.
[00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:32.460]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[00:53:32.639 --> 00:53:36.320]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:47.739]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.039]  You've done well, Lord Vader.
[00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:52.420]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[00:53:52.639 --> 00:53:54.239]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.099]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Blacks here in a minute.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.840]  Am I starting to mouthwater when you said that?
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.440]  No, I'm starving.
[00:53:58.579 --> 00:53:59.780]  Now, real quick.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.579]  This is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.900]  I was talking to you guys before.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.800]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.639]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:07.639]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.860]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[00:54:11.519 --> 00:54:16.820]  Honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:22.639]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.960]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:28.059]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.730]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[00:54:30.889 --> 00:54:33.590]  You actually entered during the 10x time period, right?
[00:54:33.909 --> 00:54:36.570]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:39.090]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[00:54:39.389 --> 00:54:42.150]  And I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[00:54:42.409 --> 00:54:43.670]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.119]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:47.699]  It's sick.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.119]  It's all black, jacked up.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.059]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.300]  He picked the wheels.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.159]  He picked the tires.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.179]  It looks good.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:54.559]  I don't know.
[00:54:54.679 --> 00:54:55.679]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.599]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[00:54:58.639 --> 00:54:59.599]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:01.300]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:09.889]  He is the winner of all the thousands of folks that came to thealexjonesstore.com and got product to be entered to win or just put your email in for free and you're entered to win.
[00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:14.349]  He bought two t-shirts, ladies and gentlemen, and he won this incredible super truck.
[00:55:14.449 --> 00:55:15.469]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.170]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:29.230]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here.
[00:55:29.539 --> 00:55:30.199]  You get to meet Alex.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.000]  You get to be on the show.
[00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:33.500]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[00:55:33.679 --> 00:55:35.480]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:36.219]  Enter your email.
[00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:37.579]  Join the VIP club.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.980]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[00:55:41.159 --> 00:55:42.219]  You'll be very excited.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.780]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:49.780]  Another incredible pickup truck.
[00:55:50.139 --> 00:55:52.659]  Super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.780]  It's a beautiful truck.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.719]  Super high ratings and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.099]  A 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:12.599]  6.7 liter high output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 pound feet per torque.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.440]  Two inch ready lift kit.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.139]  37 inch Toyo off-road tires.
[00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:19.260]  20 inch black Rhino wheels.
[00:56:19.639 --> 00:56:23.659]  12 inch touchscreen with 360 degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[00:56:24.299 --> 00:56:25.579]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.960]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:29.320]  Chris, love you, brother.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.079]  Love you, man.
[00:56:30.159 --> 00:56:30.420]  Thank you.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.840]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.300]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.260]  I only drove it once.
[00:56:37.639 --> 00:56:38.579]  Things are too nice.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.760]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[00:56:41.239 --> 00:56:43.519]  So, we'll see you at thealkshowstore.com, and thanks for all your support.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:03.780]  Alright, we're now into hour number two, and I want to focus in on all the incredibly earth-shaking developments between the NATO globalist war against Russia.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.980]  And we've got Victor Boot, who needs no introduction, with us for 30 minutes.
[00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:11.519]  I really appreciate him and his busy schedule.
[00:57:11.519 --> 00:57:14.739]  He is a famous Russian businessman and, of course, former soldier.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.159]  And he's a former political president here in the United States as well.
[00:57:19.739 --> 00:57:21.639]  And he is also...
[00:57:22.679 --> 00:57:32.699]  In the regional legislature and a member of the High Council of the LDPR. And some stations don't carry this first five, but I wanted to still get him on so we don't waste any time.
[00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:34.820]  Mr. Boot, good to have you on.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.980]  There's so much to talk about, obviously, here.
[00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:39.599]  Trump just killed through this...
[00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:42.269]  Speaker of the House, $24 billion funding.
[00:57:42.869 --> 00:57:45.889]  I want to get your take on that, but we'll do that coming up on all these stations.
[00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:46.869]  Join us in six minutes.
[00:57:47.389 --> 00:57:57.989]  Up front, you want to get into Biden trying to box Trump in with escalation, World War III potential, Russia moves to make globalist concern, globalist playbook, running out of scripts.
[00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:01.250]  So give us a little prelude, sir, of what you're going to be covering, and thank you.
[00:58:02.849 --> 00:58:28.010]  Well, basically, look, it's obvious that Biden, knowing that Trump will completely clean up the table and stop a globalist trying to bring a nuclear disaster for everybody, and their idea is to make such a scenario where Trump has no choice because escalation will reach such a level before Biden leaves.
[00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:31.429]  So they're creating a complete mess for Trump.
[00:58:32.139 --> 00:58:41.099]  When he's in the White House, then for him, it's crisis all over, and he would not know from what to start.
[00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:52.340]  But I guess Trump have enough understanding how the deep state working, how the satanist cult trying to do, plus he has a previous experience.
[00:58:52.949 --> 00:59:01.510]  And most important, that he will not let those warmongers, you know, to be even close to him.
[00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:12.389]  Because it's very important now, first of all, to stabilize and not let the situation go out of the control, especially with what's going on in Ukraine.
[00:59:13.059 --> 00:59:15.599]  And this is agony of the Kyiv regime.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:29.440]  And in this agony, it's very important why Biden administration trying to pump into Ukraine everything so at least they last another year, even if Trump in the White House.
[00:59:29.719 --> 00:59:34.219]  That's, I think, you know, in a nutshell, what we have to discuss with you.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.559]  And that's dead on.
[00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:39.340]  That's what Putin said when the attack on missiles started raining down three weeks ago.
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:39.659]  And then...
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:55.980]  The neocons came out in the New York Times and said, oh no, we are trying to escalate in a full war, and we've seen bizarre statements out of the NATO Council, admirals, and others over there, Bauer, saying, oh, maybe we should sneak attack Russia first,
[00:59:56.139 --> 01:00:00.300]  which is exactly what the Russian government has warned of, moving these missiles up to the border.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.840]  So it's clear they're trying to provocate it.
[01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:04.119]  They're not even denying it.
[01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:06.409]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:18.829]  But, you know, this test of this Sureshnik new, you know, system shown that, look, your air defense cannot stop that.
[01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.610]  Even the thought will not intercept this.
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:25.429]  So it's better, you know, to calm down and sit on the table.
[01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:31.210]  I think most important is to at least prevent anything happening before inauguration.
[01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:34.889]  A date of the 20th of January next year.
[01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:41.989]  And then we have some adult in a room with whom Russia be able to build up a proper dialogue.
[01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:49.710]  How, first of all, prevent any further escalation, and then second step about the peace in the Ukraine.
[01:00:50.869 --> 01:01:00.170]  For Russia, as President Putin many times reiterated, we have our conditions, and those conditions are not negotiable.
[01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:06.730]  First of all, Russia wants to have a collective system of security in Europe.
[01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:10.800]  Victor Boots, stay right there.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:16.780]  I want you to recap this and get into Russian conditions and the danger of the globalists escalating in the next 45 days.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.300]  We'll be back in 60 seconds when 450 plus stations join us.
[01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:21.139]  Stay with us.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.099]  All right.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:36.019]  Nothing is more important right now on the planet and really no analyst anywhere deny that, whether they're Russian or American or Chinese, whether they're left, right, neocons, globalists, populists like we are.
[01:01:37.949 --> 01:01:44.250]  The left, the globalists, the deep state, openly have said they want to escalate the war and make it so bad that it continues on forever.
[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:56.510]  You have the NATO Council last week saying, we might just sneak attack Russia with these missiles, which is an obvious provocation to try to get Russia to escalate before Trump gets in.
[01:01:56.590 --> 01:02:01.889]  And I've said for the last three weeks, Trump is behind the scenes pressuring Zelensky to call for a ceasefire.
[01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.389]  Putin has said he's ready to do that.
[01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:14.789]  And until Trump gets into office to try to then get adults at the table that actually have any basis in reality and have any responsibility.
[01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:25.489]  Putin has demonstrated with the intermediate range ballistic missile that he can get past the NATO defenses, putting them in check.
[01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:31.340]  And you haven't seen since then more attackums or storm shadows, but I wouldn't rule that out.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.599]  So I want to give Victor Boot the floor.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:43.119]  He's obviously a very famous soldier and businessman, and he's in the regional governments and the High Council of the LDPR and the regional legislature.
[01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:52.460]  And I want him to recap what he said in the last five minutes for 400-plus stations that don't carry that and then go where he was going into what...
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:04.820]  We're good to go.
[01:03:17.429 --> 01:03:20.449]  Because Zelensky's not coming to the table, and now that's been done.
[01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:25.050]  This is a huge move towards world peace, and it's not really getting any attention it deserves.
[01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:31.090]  This is Trump beginning to deliver on de-escalating the stages of World War III that lead to nuclear war.
[01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.590]  Here it is.
[01:03:41.969 --> 01:03:43.630]  I'm not planning to do that.
[01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:46.030]  There are developments by the hour in Ukraine.
[01:03:46.469 --> 01:03:57.219]  I think, as we predicted and as I said to all of you, Weeks before the election, if Donald Trump is elected, it will change the dynamic of the Russia war on Ukraine.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.679]  And we're seeing that happen.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.860]  So it is not the place of Joe Biden to make that decision now.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:07.579]  We have a newly elected president, and we're going to wait and take the new commander-in-chief's direction on all of that.
[01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:10.280]  So I don't expect any Ukraine funding to come up now.
[01:04:10.719 --> 01:04:12.300]  All right, so that's great news.
[01:04:12.659 --> 01:04:13.940]  Victor Boot, you've got the floor.
[01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:15.519]  Please give us your take on this.
[01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:24.510]  Well, at least this is the first sign to stop that conflict, because this conflict is not Russia who started.
[01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:36.110]  And definitely Russia wanted to stop the atrocities which the Kyiv regime brought on their own people in the Donbas region more than 10 years ago.
[01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:50.199]  So why, when this conflict started on February 24th, 2022, you know, main objective was declared and they keep, remain unchanged.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.219]  It's first denazification of Ukraine and demilitarization of Ukraine.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:55.840]  Why?
[01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:59.320]  It's very, very easy and very simple to understand.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:07.360]  For Russia, using Ukraine like a tool to destroy Russia by the West is not acceptable.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:13.260]  And this position was over and over repeated by the Kremlin.
[01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:23.469]  But NATO officials, and in fact, their controllers and puppet masters, globalists, said, no, no, no, no, we're going to use Ukraine.
[01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.170]  First of all, they speak the same language.
[01:05:25.329 --> 01:05:28.250]  It's easy to put up this conflict.
[01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:29.269]  What we need?
[01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:31.969]  We need a controlled puppet government of Zelenskyy.
[01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:44.550]  Zelensky for the past, you know, his term, since his term has already expired in May this year, so basically he lost any legitimacy.
[01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:45.809]  Think of this.
[01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:59.449]  If President of the United States stays over, you know, period when his, you know, office term has expired, he cannot be, you know, there without endorsement.
[01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:01.409]  And this endorsement never happened in Ukraine.
[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:05.829]  But all over, that's why for Russia now the problem.
[01:06:05.989 --> 01:06:08.969]  First of all, we want that Ukraine stay neutral.
[01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:16.010]  We want that Ukraine never be used again as a launch pad of any attacks against Russia.
[01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:26.309]  It's not Russia who moved the bases towards the NATO. It's the NATO starting and crawling closer and closer to our borders and encircling us.
[01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:37.829]  It's a NATO who expanded, like recently, getting Finland and Switzerland, which now we have a huge chunk over the thousand miles of the border with Finland.
[01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.869]  Before, it was a completely peaceful border.
[01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:43.789]  Russia never kept there any significant force.
[01:06:43.929 --> 01:06:52.550]  But now, since Finland started even organizing the military exercise, Very close to our border.
[01:06:52.769 --> 01:07:06.030]  Of course, it will cause concern for Russia and Russia will put adequate measures to, you know, counter these attempts of the NATO to always try to push the Russia out of the balance.
[01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:09.730]  What's happening in the conflict in Ukraine now?
[01:07:09.889 --> 01:07:12.610]  Look, every day, Russia moving forward and forward.
[01:07:13.289 --> 01:07:27.210]  So, even before the inauguration of Trump, there would be significant territorial gains by Russia, and the regime of Zelenskyy in Kyiv has serious issues.
[01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:41.730]  First of all, as we see, they're trying to mobilize anybody, and their teams are just literally going in the buses and catching anybody who can they, you know, found any males on the street they're catching.
[01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:51.650]  And it doesn't matter if the man, for instance, has a special, you know, permission not to be drafted, they're just grabbing them, sending them to the centers.
[01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:55.889]  Here you are, in three days, this man ends up in the front line.
[01:07:56.559 --> 01:08:01.440]  It's a significant crisis, and Ukraine knows for well that they cannot last like that.
[01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:06.559]  But this is their last attempt to, you know, it's like in a poker.
[01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:08.980]  They're just using this last chance.
[01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.539]  Maybe a miracle will happen.
[01:08:10.659 --> 01:08:11.679]  Miracle will not happen.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:18.779]  And it's only one way to negotiate the peace deal, and this peace deal must be on Russian condition.
[01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:23.460]  What we want, we definitely don't want any regime who will glorify Nazis.
[01:08:24.329 --> 01:08:31.689]  We don't want any regime who will be part of the NATO, and we don't want any regime who will be in the future threaten us.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:46.000]  That's why, for Russia, it's very important that any plans that the future Trump administration is going to consider for Russia shouldn't have, like, oh, we will put veto for Ukraine not to join NATO for, let's say, for 10 years.
[01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:51.279]  It is unacceptable, because 10 years would be passed very quick.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:58.960]  Moreover, who and how will guarantee that Ukraine will keep their part of the deal?
[01:08:59.619 --> 01:09:06.699]  We know from the Minsk agreement that, you know, it was basically a scheme where they cheated Russia.
[01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.159]  And nothing was really...
[01:09:09.159 --> 01:09:12.239]  And we later got the audio of Victoria Newland admitting that.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.680]  But I just want to back up everything you said, because...
[01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:15.949]  I'm a loyal American.
[01:09:15.949 --> 01:09:19.310]  I don't just sit and agree with Victor Boot because, you know, I don't like my country.
[01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:19.649]  I love my country.
[01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:21.729]  Everything he's saying I've researched is true.
[01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.390]  We've had Brzezinski before he died.
[01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:32.229]  We've had Soros on TV admitting, oh, I started all this in 2014. We're going to overthrow Russia itself next.
[01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:33.729]  We've seen Lloyd Austin.
[01:09:33.909 --> 01:09:34.770]  We've seen Lindsey Graham.
[01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:36.810]  We've seen them all say we love this war.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:44.699]  This is killing Russians, and this is making them have a huge battlefront, and we're encircling them, and we're going to bankrupt them by making them defend all their borders.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.819]  Imagine if Russia had all the countries around us and was moving missiles up and now bombing us.
[01:09:50.199 --> 01:09:51.880]  We would never have this restraint.
[01:09:52.039 --> 01:09:53.180]  This is insane.
[01:09:53.439 --> 01:10:09.050]  And then NATO comes out last week and says, And now we've moved nuclear-capable missiles up to their border, and then we expect Russia to take these missiles shooting in with conventionals that can be reloaded in a matter of minutes with hydrogen bombs.
[01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:14.409]  And then they say we might sneak attack them with nukes to make the Russians respond.
[01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:19.189]  This is insane megalomania at the highest levels.
[01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:20.529]  Then we learned six months ago.
[01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:24.119]  And three months ago, Zelensky goes and meets with Trump, says, I want nukes.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.819]  Trump says no.
[01:10:25.039 --> 01:10:28.180]  Then we hear out of Der Spiegel that NATO's thinking about giving him nukes.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.199]  Then, two weeks ago, Biden says, maybe we'll give him nukes.
[01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:37.300]  Incredible provocation, the likes of which the world's never seen.
[01:10:37.539 --> 01:10:41.300]  I mean, we're shooting missiles at you that are meant to have nukes on them.
[01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:45.229]  We want to get you used to it, and we may actually sneak attack you with nukes.
[01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:50.909]  That is, the level of provocation is the most psychotic in human history.
[01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:52.789]  Victor Boot, can you respond to that?
[01:10:53.949 --> 01:11:12.090]  Well, first of all, look, it's crystal clear that whether it's American attacking systems or it's a British or French storm shadow system, they rely heavily on the personnel of the NATO. First of all, who gonna load the flight plan into this?
[01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:13.350]  Who gonna choose the targets?
[01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:25.140]  It's all done by the NATO. So claiming that, oh, we have no responsibility since we give this weapon to the Ukrainians, you know, it's their choice which target they do.
[01:11:25.359 --> 01:11:41.000]  That's why Putin warned that, look, this attack, if Storm Shadow will hit anywhere further into Russian territory, then Russia has all rights also to hit Britain, to hit France, to hit, you know, stations where they've been loaded.
[01:11:41.279 --> 01:11:43.220]  Same true with the attack system.
[01:11:44.390 --> 01:12:05.090]  That's why we as a world have never been closer to the really grand-scale world conflict, which can easily escalate into the nuclear exchange, because, as you said, Russia shows tremendous restraint in these answers.
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:18.630]  Every time President Putin is trying to calm down all our generals who are trying to say, hey, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this, because he believes that there is adults in the room on another side.
[01:12:18.789 --> 01:12:26.109]  And sooner or later, those real patriots, like in America, will take over because they are professionals.
[01:12:26.789 --> 01:12:28.130]  They're also patriots.
[01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:31.569]  The same like we patriots of Russia, they're patriots of America.
[01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:45.390]  And this is in no any interest of real patriots to have this nuclear conflict because we, ex-military, know very well what nuclear conflict will bring.
[01:12:46.079 --> 01:12:47.659]  So it's end of civilization.
[01:12:48.199 --> 01:12:57.539]  It's only satanic cult of the globalists who are dreaming to sacrifice everybody by thinking that they're going to survive in their bunkers.
[01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:02.840]  So this is a very, very, very dangerous and very peril period.
[01:13:02.939 --> 01:13:11.579]  So we need to pray and we need to do anything we have to do to stop Biden's administration to bring this escalation further.
[01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:28.489]  Moreover, I guess this is a time when the American Transit Administration has not only to send a clear message to Ukrainian Zelensky, but also to have a serious talk to their British and the French counterparts,
[01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:34.529]  who is behind this escalation now in Ukraine, and tell them, hey guys, you know, back off!
[01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:35.310]  Why?
[01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:40.529]  Because if you continue like this, it can be easily get out of the control.
[01:13:41.479 --> 01:13:48.100]  For Biden administration, again, for them, it's a plan to set up a minefield.
[01:13:48.239 --> 01:14:00.840]  So when Trump is there in the January 20th in the White House, he has no path left except taking further this escalation.
[01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:09.159]  Of course, Ukraine gonna do the provocation, whether it's for the Christmas, whether it's for the New Year or for the Orthodox Christmas.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:18.300]  For them, they need to have some propaganda achievement, some big, nice picture, which would lead to another disaster.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:30.819]  So, a part of the Russia successfully for the past several months decimated Ukrainian electrical and thermal, you know, network as a sign.
[01:14:30.939 --> 01:14:33.659]  Hey guys, you know, do you understand what is the next?
[01:14:34.319 --> 01:14:40.859]  But everywhere now in Russian, you know, platforms or, you know, there is a public discussion.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.680]  What do we do further?
[01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:50.279]  Yes, Russia could easily destroy all the electric network grids and this, but we understand that the civilian population is going to suffer.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.720]  We understand that the children are going to suffer.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.039]  We understand what humanitarian crisis would be there.
[01:14:56.239 --> 01:15:01.800]  So for the past three years, Russia was very, very careful in choosing the targets.
[01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:14.909]  Look, we could destroy this system like a communication network, water network, you know, electrical grid in the first three days of the war when we've been, you know, going all over the territory.
[01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.470]  But it's not happening.
[01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:26.550]  And the reason why, because Putin said, hey, we should make sure that there is no any civilian casualties in this conflict.
[01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:30.819]  And there's been very little, except there's been a lot on the pro-Russia side, obviously.
[01:15:31.039 --> 01:15:35.680]  So, looking at this, just a week and a half ago, the Biden administration said we're looking at giving nukes.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.539]  They backed off that real fast.
[01:15:38.739 --> 01:15:51.359]  Just two years ago, he was saying we can't give F-16s or Abrams tanks to Ukraine because that's World War III. Now Trump's new National Security Advisor, Congressman Waltz, has said we're going up the escalation ladder towards nuclear war very quickly.
[01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:52.819]  We need to, quote, de-escalate.
[01:15:52.939 --> 01:16:01.279]  But then I saw chilling statements by General Kellogg, the new, quote, peace envoy, saying, oh, maybe Trump's behind Biden bombing Russia as a negotiation point.
[01:16:01.479 --> 01:16:05.199]  We now know that wasn't true, but definitely some dangerous things going on.
[01:16:05.479 --> 01:16:19.250]  Victor Booth, what are your main concerns in the next 45 days, as you alluded to earlier, but I want you to elaborate on We're good to go.
[01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:32.710]  We're good to go.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:40.640]  Staging attacks before Trump gets in to try to escalate.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.439]  I'm not talking about further escalation.
[01:16:42.579 --> 01:16:46.760]  That's on the table too into Russia with these offensive precision missiles.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:48.500]  That's also a problem.
[01:16:48.619 --> 01:16:51.319]  But what about false flags to blame Russia?
[01:16:51.319 --> 01:16:52.520]  I'm very concerned about that.
[01:16:53.619 --> 01:17:00.500]  Well, first of all, we know that Ukraine amassed enough bacteriological and chemical weapons, you know.
[01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:14.920]  They also pretty quick can make a dirty bomb and then threaten not only Russia but the, you know, entire Europe because contamination will not recognize any borders, whether it's NATO borders or Russian borders.
[01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:23.090]  Second one, because Zelensky don't give a damn about all population, he did absolutely nothing to prepare for the winter.
[01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:26.489]  A harsh winter cold setting right now.
[01:17:26.789 --> 01:17:30.270]  Temperature way below freezing points.
[01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.250]  And what are you going to do?
[01:17:32.939 --> 01:17:48.760]  So, apart of that, of course, they're going to try to make a sneak attack deep inside the Russian territory, whether using their self-made drones or it would be,
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.779]  you know, French and the American systems.
[01:17:52.109 --> 01:17:55.050]  But as I said, Russia said a strong warning.
[01:17:55.550 --> 01:18:05.630]  So let's NATO generals and those who took decision, think twice before they're going to decide to choose the targets, before they're going to decide to launch them.
[01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:09.170]  Because, look, crew, who is manning the system?
[01:18:09.779 --> 01:18:22.359]  The crew who is taking intelligence, the crew who is loading this information into storm shadow, into the attackers, it's, you know, little secret that everybody know about it.
[01:18:22.479 --> 01:18:23.359]  It's all foreign.
[01:18:23.479 --> 01:18:24.220]  It's all Americans.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.180]  It's all British.
[01:18:25.479 --> 01:18:26.460]  It's all French.
[01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:29.779]  So then think of this.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:41.170]  If Russia going to use the system, which we're going to pass to Mexico, let's say in a future conflict, And claiming, no, no, no, no, it's not really our, because we transferred, we sold it to Mexicans.
[01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.170]  They can choose any targets and use them.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:50.600]  But if Mexicans would be able to load the flight plans, choose the targets, hell no.
[01:18:50.899 --> 01:18:51.319]  Correct?
[01:18:51.579 --> 01:18:53.380]  It all depends on NATO infrastructure.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.720]  Well, Victor, let's expand on that.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:08.279]  Two weeks ago, the Biden administration, Pentagon, said in press conferences, both Kirby and the Secretary of Defense said, oh, don't worry, we're choosing the targets and running the attacks, so we won't hit civilian targets.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.199]  They admitted they're running the attacks.
[01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:11.409]  They admit it.
[01:19:11.529 --> 01:19:20.270]  So look, if you admit it, you're in conflict on us, so Russia has a full right to say, hey, it's not Ukrainian who is against us, it's you.
[01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:22.989]  So you are now a legitimate target.
[01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:36.500]  That's why President Putin said, look, we can start hitting London, we can start hitting military British bases, French bases on French territory, and we have enough weapons for To do that.
[01:19:36.579 --> 01:19:39.699]  And of course, if you did that to us, we would have attacked a long time ago.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.640]  So in the time we have left, I want you to be able to add any other points.
[01:19:41.739 --> 01:19:43.020]  We've got about four minutes, five minutes.
[01:19:43.399 --> 01:19:58.800]  But just briefly, because you got caught up in the last break, elaborate on this intermediate-range hypersonic Ballistic missile that demonstrated that it could get past the defenses and launch multiple re-entry delivery vehicles,
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.220]  or MIRV. That was a simulated nuclear attack.
[01:20:02.359 --> 01:20:04.180]  Putin said that, obviously, as well.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.220]  I said that before he said it.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.340]  That's clearly what it was.
[01:20:07.479 --> 01:20:17.939]  That was so important strategically in detente to just demonstrate that so that the crazies at the table would be silenced by the same people in the West and de-escalate this.
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.800]  Can you speak to that?
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:27.640]  Look, the footage of this, you know, a moment when this, you know, Mervs entering, fantastic.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:35.460]  So, and then in the, you know, network, you can, in social networks, you can see the result of this attack.
[01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:46.340]  It's a huge, you know, huge kind of the, it's almost like something artificially digged up, very, very sharp, you know, even in the ages of that.
[01:20:46.619 --> 01:20:50.739]  And this is huge, like over 25 meters, and this was just ballistic.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.819]  Nothing was there.
[01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:52.859]  Think of this.
[01:20:52.979 --> 01:21:01.960]  If this will have explosive warheads, or if this will have even tactical nuclear warheads, what kind of damage it can do.
[01:21:02.239 --> 01:21:09.399]  And this system also now covering the entire European continent.
[01:21:10.069 --> 01:21:15.069]  So the NATO, again, should considering whether they choose to escalate.
[01:21:15.989 --> 01:21:25.229]  And that's obviously a response to Secretary Austin and Lindsey Graham and the NATO heads saying, Russia has old weapons, they're bluffing, don't worry, let's keep bombing them.
[01:21:25.909 --> 01:21:30.489]  Russia had to respond then with this to say, no, we do have new weapons.
[01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:32.930]  Absolutely.
[01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.909]  And it's not the first time that Russia demonstrated this capacity.
[01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:38.449]  What are they willing to do?
[01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:47.210]  That Russia start making, you know, atmospheric or terrestrial nuclear tests in the Arctic region?
[01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.189]  Or what?
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:57.090]  I guess only the mushroom, you know, picture of the nuclear tests happening in the Arctic will calm down these heads?
[01:21:58.199 --> 01:22:05.399]  Well, I've seen reports that Russia is considering, I don't know if it's true, it's in the Western media, above ground nuclear test or below ground as a demonstration.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:19.760]  Well, there was a serious discussion in this because, you know, many experts saying, yes, we need to do because apparently the message with the Arashnik system not yet really was understood by all of them.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.960]  So what you don't understand in this scenario.
[01:22:24.999 --> 01:22:35.380]  So, this is now a ball on the side of the, you know, NATO cool heads within these idiots who is there, within this, you know, group of the clowns.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:57.659]  We still hope that there is some reasonable people, and I strongly believe that this administration of the Trump, who is now in this process of forming and trying, you know, contact Every global leader trying to establish and understand how to prevent this escalation before any peace talk can happen.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.460]  All right, Victor Boot, we got one minute left.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.859]  Just gut level, are you feeling good about things and we're not going to have a nuclear war?
[01:23:05.979 --> 01:23:09.140]  I mean, just as a father, as a patriot, I mean, gut level, what do you feel?
[01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:26.090]  Look, we have to pray to God and ask Him to forgive us and prevent and save us from this disaster, because now it's a very strange situation, you know.
[01:23:26.829 --> 01:23:28.210]  Alex, nobody will ask you.
[01:23:28.369 --> 01:23:29.590]  Nobody will ask Trump.
[01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:32.609]  Nobody will ask this if they want to start nuclear war.
[01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.130]  They just start pressing launches and start attacking.
[01:23:35.369 --> 01:23:37.149]  And what Russia has to do?
[01:23:37.289 --> 01:23:38.329]  We have to answer.
[01:23:38.529 --> 01:23:42.430]  And this is like a situation they're playing with.
[01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:45.670]  That's why they're trying to box Trump into the corner.
[01:23:45.869 --> 01:23:50.010]  When he's in, he's already in the midst of the huge conflict.
[01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:55.170]  He's already in the midst of the situation where it's impossible to walk it back.
[01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:59.329]  And this is a, you know- Hold on, Victor.
[01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:01.970]  I have one more question for you.
[01:24:02.069 --> 01:24:03.229]  Hold over for just a few more minutes.
[01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:05.689]  We have another guest coming on about the pardons.
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:08.430]  We've been through a lot in Infowars.
[01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:11.149]  America and the world has been through hell.
[01:24:11.329 --> 01:24:12.630]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:14.670]  The globalists are in full panic mode.

[01:26:05.789 --> 01:26:21.369]  All right, Victor Boot, who is in a major government regional legislature as a representative and obviously a famous soldier and businessman and really expert on war and military, former political prisoner for a decade here in the United States, where he began listening to me on local AM and FM radio.
[01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:23.210]  That's how he's been familiar with the show.
[01:26:23.289 --> 01:26:24.850]  You really don't ever see him on any other broadcast.
[01:26:25.329 --> 01:26:26.470]  We're honored to have him on.
[01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:28.689]  I agree with everything he's saying as I've studied the issues here.
[01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:30.390]  We are attacking Russia.
[01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:31.689]  We are on their doorstep.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:39.180]  The Soros and the left are trying to brainwash them with all the same transgender death cult crap trying to flood them with illegal aliens.
[01:26:39.739 --> 01:26:41.640]  We have the same enemy, the New World Order.
[01:26:41.979 --> 01:26:45.279]  And Trump knows that and has said our real enemies are here at home, the globalists.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.279]  And the media spins that, oh, the American people are Trump's enemy.
[01:26:48.399 --> 01:26:53.840]  No, he says the globalists, the Soroses, the New World Order, the people that want destabilization.
[01:26:54.079 --> 01:26:56.380]  So, Victor, in closing, I'm going to play the clip in a moment.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.920]  Well, in fact, let's go to it now.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:04.420]  Here's Putin last week, but I wanted you to be able to Give us your take on what he's really saying here.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.420]  Because it's clear what he's saying.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.880]  We know Trump's reasonable.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.500]  We know he's pragmatic.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.739]  But we also know they tried to kill him.
[01:27:10.819 --> 01:27:11.659]  They're going to try again.
[01:27:12.079 --> 01:27:13.520]  I'm sure he's being cautious.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.680]  We hope he is.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  And, you know, wow, this is a serious situation.
[01:27:19.039 --> 01:27:21.840]  What was Putin really doing here?
[01:27:21.899 --> 01:27:22.399]  Here it is.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  Well, probably just like me, you are amazed.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:28.819]  Not by the fact...
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:40.140]  That absolutely uncivilized means had been used against Trump, all the way up to assassination attempts, numerous assassination attempts.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.239]  And I think he's not safe even now.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:58.800]  The history of the United States has known many But I think President Trump is a smart person and a cautious one, I hope.
[01:27:59.899 --> 01:28:16.699]  But what amazed me most, that in fighting him, not only Trump was subjected to humiliating court procedures, accusations and so on,
[01:28:16.819 --> 01:28:19.659]  but his family was attacked as well.
[01:28:19.779 --> 01:28:21.079]  His children were attacked.
[01:28:21.899 --> 01:28:23.920]  Gangsters don't do this in Russia.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:30.119]  When criminal gangs fight, they don't touch children and women.
[01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:34.069]  It's men who fight among themselves.
[01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:38.189]  But those guys stooped as low as that.
[01:28:38.649 --> 01:28:53.899]  I think this looks so bad that it only reaffirms It reconfirms how low the political system of the United States has fallen.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.760]  There's a lot to unpack there, and I'm gonna give you the floor for another five minutes, and then I know you gotta go, and thank you, Victor Boat.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.159]  But specifically, that's why we have chivalry.
[01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:06.529]  And the entire western world was based on this and civilization is based on it.
[01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:10.590]  But it's not that governments and even gangsters are wimps.
[01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:11.510]  They don't target women and children.
[01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:13.550]  They don't want theirs targeted either.
[01:29:13.789 --> 01:29:19.310]  And if you do target people's women and children, you enrage them and then they're going to get you.
[01:29:19.819 --> 01:29:25.140]  And so I'm not thankful they did this to Trump and me and thousands of other prominent people.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.739]  And for what you know they've done to me, it's nothing.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.359]  What I haven't talked about, because I know that comes to the territory.
[01:29:30.539 --> 01:29:31.340]  I'm not a victim.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.380]  I'm not going to sit around and whine.
[01:29:32.619 --> 01:29:33.979]  But these are evil people.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.140]  It only makes me fight harder.
[01:29:35.279 --> 01:29:36.600]  I know Trump's just like me.
[01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:40.920]  It doesn't intimidate me and enrages me and gives me so much more energy than I would have.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.560]  And now we have to prosecute these people.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.020]  We have to punish them because they're going to keep doing it if we don't.
[01:29:47.289 --> 01:29:54.470]  But the fact they tried to kill him and did a bunch of other horrible things, they have got a real enemy now, and they are in full panic mode.
[01:29:54.590 --> 01:30:00.390]  So spend some time unpacking what Putin was saying there and your response to this issue of chivalry and closing, Victor Booth.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.520]  Well, again, as you said, chivalry was a cult.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.640]  Even if you have a war, even if you have a conflict, you need to be still human in this, correct?
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.420]  You don't kill those who surrender.
[01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:17.079]  You don't attack civilians for no reason.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.180]  You don't kill those who are unprotected.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:26.340]  You do and behave the same way like you would like that your enemy would behave.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.220]  And this is a basic rule.
[01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:45.609]  So here Putin, just again, bringing back Into what the West lost it for past, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, understanding that, look, despite we have argument, despite we have a conflict, let's stay the human and let's just not go into the conflict.
[01:30:46.329 --> 01:30:53.649]  This is especially very important because he says what's going on in American political life.
[01:30:54.050 --> 01:31:07.989]  That the Democrats, you know, cross all kind of the red lines on prosecuting the Trump, which is another sign of the huge crisis which is American political system are in.
[01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:17.409]  Because if your opponents cannot use Trump, Democratically prescribed means of, you know, addressing their grievances.
[01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:26.750]  They are acting like the scumbags, because even the gangster will not, you know, behave like that.
[01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:28.989]  You know, they would not touch the families.
[01:31:28.989 --> 01:31:33.510]  They would not do the revenge of anybody related to the Trump.
[01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:39.729]  Look what's happening for those who have been prosecuted on the January 6th attacks in the Capitol.
[01:31:40.689 --> 01:31:44.810]  They're still in the jail, and many of them without even, you know, indictment.
[01:31:44.989 --> 01:31:48.710]  So this is very important that Trump will solve that problem.
[01:31:49.050 --> 01:32:01.640]  At the same time, this should be, you know, absolutely clear that the Democrats for the past, what, 20 years was shouting and screaming, nobody above the law, nobody above the law.
[01:32:01.779 --> 01:32:02.600]  And what's happening?
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:03.920]  Really, like what?
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.159]  Less than 20 hours ago, Biden pardoned his son Hunter.
[01:32:08.439 --> 01:32:09.220]  So what next?
[01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:10.319]  He's going to pardon himself?
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.939]  He's going to pardon Blinken?
[01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:16.720]  He's going to pardon all his administration for the present, past, and the future scenes?
[01:32:17.279 --> 01:32:19.020]  You may have missed it, Victor.
[01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:21.279]  No, he's announcing he is going to pardon all of them.
[01:32:22.359 --> 01:32:23.779]  Yeah, that's what.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.739]  It's basically nothing short of the indulgence, you know, like used to be in medieval time.
[01:32:28.899 --> 01:32:36.899]  You come to the church, you pay, you know, one big bag with gold coins, and they forgive you for the next your life of all the sins you can do.
[01:32:37.359 --> 01:32:45.579]  But I guess, you know, all people, not only in America, but every else in the world are sick and tired of this globalist.
[01:32:45.909 --> 01:32:54.689]  Sick and tired of their peddling and pushing their propaganda, playing with the word democracy, playing with this peace and stability.
[01:32:55.069 --> 01:33:06.090]  So we are really now living in this reality where even, you know, 1984 is a joke, comparing what we are seeing with our eyes right now.
[01:33:06.409 --> 01:33:08.710]  So what is exit plan?
[01:33:08.909 --> 01:33:10.289]  Exit plan is very simple.
[01:33:10.909 --> 01:33:19.170]  When Trump gets out, and we hope that they would not start the nuclear war, there should be differently, a new, you know, negotiations.
[01:33:19.489 --> 01:33:22.829]  Okay, this is a new, new rules.
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:31.430]  This is a new international law, because for the past 10 years, international law was completely eroded and destroyed by the West.
[01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:37.210]  It's nothing there left anymore, because you can't have a law which only for you, but not for me.
[01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:38.109]  I totally agree.
[01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:40.369]  In closing, let me ask you this.
[01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:45.310]  I mean, I got the main message of Putin, but what was his message to Trump?
[01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:49.729]  I mean, I think it was the message to the world that the whole world's in danger.
[01:33:49.829 --> 01:33:53.489]  The deep state's obviously going to try to stop this, and these are thugs.
[01:33:53.569 --> 01:33:57.850]  And as you said, he's bringing back common sense, back to the future, chivalry.
[01:33:57.989 --> 01:33:59.350]  One other clip I want to get your take on.
[01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:06.109]  Putin yesterday had a reporter A German reporter spoke in English and he said, why don't you speak in your own nation?
[01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:07.430]  Why don't you care about your own country?
[01:34:07.529 --> 01:34:11.029]  That is so fundamental to bring back national sovereignty.
[01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:18.710]  That will stop the globalists when we start thinking about our nations and our people and our interest again and aren't ashamed of our countries.
[01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:20.130]  That's good for the whole world.
[01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:22.170]  And that's what fighting globalism is about.
[01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:22.729]  Here's Putin.
[01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:28.590]  You're representing the Federal Republic of Germany.
[01:34:29.369 --> 01:34:30.789]  You should speak German.
[01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:33.329]  Why are you asking me in English?
[01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:35.149]  Think about your sovereignty.
[01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:40.010]  Don't you have translation from German?
[01:34:40.869 --> 01:34:42.350]  Well, come on.
[01:34:44.569 --> 01:34:50.930]  So what Putin's doing, like you just said, he's trying to bring back sanity like he's teaching three-year-olds.
[01:34:52.579 --> 01:34:58.560]  Well, at least, you know, we need to say that Putin has a good, you know, degree of humor.
[01:34:58.779 --> 01:35:03.520]  So he's always finding this situation and he's always trying to use it as illustration.
[01:35:03.859 --> 01:35:05.979]  And it's absolutely, you're absolutely right.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:10.079]  Look, why are not Macron talking to all his aides in English?
[01:35:10.819 --> 01:35:16.859]  Not of French, because for French people to speak English, it's like, you know, torture.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:32.180]  But he is, you know, a typical result of the Soros, you know, projects, a typical, you know, fruit of the globalists, who don't care about his own sovereignty, who are going to just easily sacrifice it,
[01:35:32.319 --> 01:35:36.460]  the same way like Zerlensky sacrificing his, you know, population.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.579]  You know, without any purpose.
[01:35:39.939 --> 01:35:41.819]  Why to continue this conflict?
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:46.100]  Because all military, you know, analysis says, look, you already lost it.
[01:35:46.319 --> 01:35:48.300]  Stop it and start negotiating.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:54.119]  Prevent unnecessary death of your own, you know, citizens.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.340]  Hell no.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.659]  He will still try to fight till the last Ukrainians.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.659]  And look what Putin says everywhere.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.100]  And it's the law in Russia.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.039]  Mother, father, speak your language, know your culture.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:09.600]  That's all common sense.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:13.399]  But here in the government documents, don't say mother, father.
[01:36:13.619 --> 01:36:14.699]  Don't say ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:16.380]  Don't say American.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.319]  Taking down our founding father statues.
[01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:23.840]  They are taking our identity and giving us slavery and giving us Satanism.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.800]  Victor Boot, have a great Christmas.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:26.739]  Thank you for the time.
[01:36:26.859 --> 01:36:28.140]  I hope we're still here next year.
[01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:29.340]  I have faith we will be.
[01:36:29.479 --> 01:36:31.119]  As you said, pray to God for peace.
[01:36:31.239 --> 01:36:32.279]  And thank you so much.
[01:36:33.539 --> 01:36:35.260]  Thank you so much and we pray for peace.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.399]  Thank you.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.279]  Alright, that's powerful.
[01:36:38.819 --> 01:36:42.319]  Robert Barnes is going to be popping in any minute now.
[01:36:42.399 --> 01:36:43.260]  He was a little bit delayed.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.699]  I want to just get 10 minutes with him on the pardons, because I already know the law, but I want to get it from a constitutional lawyer.
[01:36:49.079 --> 01:36:54.119]  And we have giant COVID news that's so massive that is also coming up.
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:55.659]  And when I say massive, it's the biggest ever.
[01:36:55.779 --> 01:36:57.140]  I mean, the wheels have completely come off.
[01:36:58.159 --> 01:37:02.199]  Trump is looking at going up for criminal charges for gain of function.
[01:37:02.659 --> 01:37:05.479]  And Fauci, he's got RFK Jr. in there advising him.
[01:37:06.359 --> 01:37:16.020]  And I see this constant response, not constant, but I mean, it's not the majority or even a large minority, but I see it in the comments on X and M4s over and over again.
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:21.859]  Oh, well, Trump went along with warp speed, so we don't want to hear about going after the COVID tyrants.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.020]  Trump didn't know that.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.340]  This was an Obama globalist project they had on the shelf.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.760]  They said it was a new virus.
[01:37:27.779 --> 01:37:30.579]  He wasn't for all the lockdowns or for shots.
[01:37:31.199 --> 01:37:32.920]  They basically killed the recovery with it.
[01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:37.270]  Now they're bragging, oh, we're going to have a new pandemic to shut down Trump.
[01:37:37.369 --> 01:37:39.949]  Hotez said yesterday, that's coming up next hour.
[01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:47.050]  And so Trump, you know, the video recording of him talking to Kennedy came out where he's like, yeah, these shots do look bad.
[01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:47.869]  Trump knows it.
[01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:50.210]  His answer is go after the people that did it.
[01:37:50.609 --> 01:37:55.670]  Bring in RFK Jr. as the head of Health and Human Services and walk this back.
[01:37:55.829 --> 01:37:57.369]  That's what Trump's doing.
[01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:01.529]  And he's certainly not going to accept new lockdowns and new tyranny when they try it again.
[01:38:01.930 --> 01:38:12.189]  As Hotez said, quote, on video and in the Houston Chronicle, Big Pharma shill Peter Hotez warns, quote, potential pandemics will come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[01:38:12.489 --> 01:38:16.829]  And they've got them all announced and all ready, and we've got to stop them.
[01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:18.130]  So...
[01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:22.850]  Would you rather have the Democrats that are guaranteed to bring you the UN treaty and all the power grab?
[01:38:22.949 --> 01:38:23.090]  No.
[01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:24.449]  Trump made a mistake.
[01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:26.350]  He didn't understand disease acts.
[01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:28.050]  He didn't understand it was in the globalist documents.
[01:38:28.210 --> 01:38:30.090]  They would use this to take control.
[01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:34.609]  Now he's got RLK Jr. about to be the head of Health and Human Services.
[01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:37.229]  He's got the head of the NIH, a super patriot.
[01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:40.609]  That totally understands all this.
[01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:46.369]  I mean, we ought to make the Florida Surgeon General, the U.S. Attorney Surgeon General, the one they did pick, is terrible.
[01:38:46.869 --> 01:38:50.710]  None of this is perfect, but it's a lot better than what we would have had.
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:58.130]  So very, very exciting things that are going down right now.
[01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:09.010]  And they are hyping major new viruses and mystery viruses, killing all these people in the U.S., Just since yesterday, they rolled out this new hysteria that I'll be getting to next hour.
[01:39:09.170 --> 01:39:16.130]  Now, I want to hit some of this other political news.
[01:39:16.569 --> 01:39:27.270]  I want to hit some of this other really, really important news dealing with what's happening to the Soros operations.
[01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:28.829]  Some good news as well.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.500]  We will get to all of that in a moment.
[01:39:32.619 --> 01:39:38.359]  But first, please remember, you're the reason this broadcast reaching tens of millions a day is on the air.
[01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:43.479]  And we try to make it easy to support with incredible products that if you'll just try them, I know you're going to love them.
[01:39:44.329 --> 01:39:47.109]  4.7, 4.8 star independent reviews.

[01:39:56.050 --> 01:40:01.609]  And any of your purchases there, do not go to the bad guys that are even able to shut down InfoWars, Big Hearing Monday.
[01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:06.550]  We believe that we're going to win, that we see it very hard for us not to.
[01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:12.409]  They've been caught in cut and dry, criminal, in our view, our opinion, bid rigging.
[01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:18.750]  And it's in our lawsuits and our filings saying, this is criminal, this is criminal activity, here's the code, here's how they did it, here's the documents.
[01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:28.270]  But regardless, going to the AlexJonesStore.com will help fund the Alex Jones Network, at AJNLive on X, and the studios, and the bigger studio that's almost done, and all the rest of it.
[01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:35.649]  So we need your support, plus we've got the very best Patriot apparel right now, limited edition, the AlexJonesStore.com, the best supplements, you name it.
[01:40:35.789 --> 01:40:36.489]  Here's an example.
[01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:41.130]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:40:41.939 --> 01:40:44.300]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:40:45.159 --> 01:40:47.779]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:40:48.079 --> 01:40:51.359]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:40:51.659 --> 01:40:54.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.380]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:40:57.039 --> 01:41:02.840]  It's officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:41:03.039 --> 01:41:06.140]  We're going to take control January 20th and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:41:06.439 --> 01:41:07.520]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:41:07.779 --> 01:41:08.640]  We're going to get behind.
[01:41:08.859 --> 01:41:12.079]  What did the United Nations have to do with this open border crisis?
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:13.840]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:41:13.979 --> 01:41:18.100]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:19.560]  Again, by design.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.239]  And so much more is happening.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.279]  This is an exciting time.
[01:41:22.819 --> 01:41:24.460]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.979]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air.
[01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:28.550]  Now, more than ever.
[01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.529]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:31.510]  So we make it easy.

[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:52.699]  And I personally love this one.
[01:41:52.899 --> 01:41:56.380]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:41:56.579 --> 01:41:58.859]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:41:58.859 --> 01:42:00.180]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.319]  And this will horrify me.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.039]  Leftists.
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:07.060]  And then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking in fear, walking on the street.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:07.739]  Say, it's okay.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:12.819]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:42:13.239 --> 01:42:19.479]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.920]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.

[01:44:19.590 --> 01:44:21.989]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:24.430]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump in the fight.
[01:44:24.689 --> 01:44:25.710]  God bless and good luck.
[01:44:26.289 --> 01:44:27.350]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:30.250]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:44:30.409 --> 01:44:33.310]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:37.010]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:52.239]  A lot of different people have, outside of InfoWars and outside of my operations, have put out shirts for decades with my picture on them.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:59.659]  And we've done a few that our people made, but I never backed them because I just don't like pictures of myself on things.
[01:44:59.659 --> 01:45:00.939]  It's a little too much.
[01:45:01.859 --> 01:45:07.399]  But this new Christmas sweater is awesome.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.600]  I know that.
[01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:11.359]  That is a winner.
[01:45:11.899 --> 01:45:15.739]  I think it's going to be a bestseller, and it keeps us on the air in its limited edition this Christmas.
[01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:17.039]  All right.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:25.020]  And I want to bring back that one we did a few years ago about Jeffrey Epstein didn't hang himself with the Christmas tree lights around his neck.
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:25.960]  We need to put that out, too.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.359]  All right.
[01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:33.609]  I'm not kind of pausing here because I have lack of news.
[01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:39.550]  My head's spinning right now trying to budget my brain with roughly two hours left of the transmission today.
[01:45:39.789 --> 01:45:40.930]  A little more than two hours.
[01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:44.529]  What I need to hit because it's all super important.
[01:45:48.829 --> 01:45:51.970]  You know, I've already harped on them planning to trigger a race war.
[01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:56.250]  And that's definitely what they're going to pull once he gets into office.
[01:45:56.949 --> 01:46:01.550]  And it's hard for me not to go back to the new developments that just came out since I've been on air on that.
[01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.109]  But you know what?
[01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:05.390]  I've already spent hours on it yesterday.
[01:46:14.489 --> 01:46:16.649]  I'll shoot a special report today after the show on it.
[01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:17.850]  I'm done talking about it.
[01:46:18.090 --> 01:46:19.010]  If people don't listen to me...
[01:46:20.119 --> 01:46:22.359]  And we got a few million people watch the clips yesterday.
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.539]  We need a hundred million on this.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.699]  We need to stop this.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.000]  I mean, look, I know what I'm talking about.
[01:46:27.359 --> 01:46:28.739]  We're just sit here and take this.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:32.399]  So I've got all this other stuff.
[01:46:32.579 --> 01:46:38.119]  I mean, obviously the hearings yesterday were Tennessee passed laws because they caught Vanderbilt and a bunch of other groups.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:48.119]  It's happening all over the country, but Tennessee did something and said, you're not going to, without parental consent, without people knowing, brainwash kids in schools and bring them in and cut their testicles off and cut little girls' breasts off.
[01:46:49.039 --> 01:46:53.800]  Until they're 18. If they're psychotic enough at 18, I guess we're quote a free country.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.020]  Can you go to a doctor and say, I want my arm cut off just because I'm a nut?
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:01.159]  No, they'll call a paddy wagon, or at least they should, but not now.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.600]  So can we at least just say you can't cut your pecker off until you're 18?
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.760]  And they're up there whining and bitching.
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:28.789]  Soros run ACLU. And then Sotomayor, we've got the clubs, said, oh, it's just like an aspirin to give kids these super dangerous puberty blockers that fry them for life, stump their growth, carcinogenic, cause heart problems.
[01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:35.949]  I mean, people go and buy these miniature pigs, and they're not miniature pigs.
[01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:43.949]  They give them puberty blockers when they're babies to make them runts.
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:47.640]  It's the same damn thing.
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:51.159]  And then Sotomayor's like, well, this is just like an aspirin.
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:53.859]  And then...
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.420]  Jackson tops it off and says, well, this is like trying to ban interracial marriage.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:30.090]  So, big globalist institutions in private and public schools paying them grants to secretly have access to your young children starting in now preschool to brainwash them and put them in a secret database to put them in these little school clubs to literally put them in a cult to then fast track them for chemical or surgical sterilization mutilation That is like trying to pass a law against interracial marriage.
[01:48:30.789 --> 01:48:31.810]  No, it's not.
[01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:34.289]  It's conformed consent.
[01:48:34.289 --> 01:48:40.250]  If you violate informed consent of an adult, it's punishable by death under the Nuremberg Code.
[01:48:40.529 --> 01:48:42.649]  That's Joseph Mingle and Nazi stuff.
[01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:46.930]  We got our own federal laws that correspond to that.
[01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:55.029]  And then you go and secretly groom children to put them into your cult and do this.
[01:48:55.409 --> 01:48:58.510]  I mean, it violates the Nuremberg Code on steroids.
[01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:59.270]  We're going to go to break.
[01:49:00.090 --> 01:49:01.670]  We got Dr. Judy Mikovits coming up.
[01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:03.050]  We love her.
[01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.710]  She's awesome.
[01:49:04.029 --> 01:49:09.189]  But I got to get Robert Barnes on all of this and on the pardons and ask where that's going.
[01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:12.069]  So he'll pop in for 15, 20 minutes.
[01:49:12.729 --> 01:49:14.210]  I just thought to get him on like an hour ago.
[01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:15.229]  He's graciously popped in.
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.239]  I want to have her on for at least an hour, so just tell her we'll get her on like 20 after and then we'll hold her over.
[01:49:21.439 --> 01:49:24.500]  Hopefully she can do that because we got to hit all this COVID news, biggest ever.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.199]  She's totally vindicated.
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:30.239]  She's like, they're putting cancer viruses in all these COVID shots.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:40.029]  Of course, she had the documents, but now it's like mainline, prestigious, Medical journals are like, it's not just cancer viruses, it's a concentrate of them.
[01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:44.789]  So the spike protein turns off your DNA repair, and then it loads you with cancer viruses.
[01:49:44.789 --> 01:49:46.449]  It is a beautiful weapon.
[01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:47.689]  I mean, it is sleek.
[01:49:48.689 --> 01:49:50.649]  It is on purpose.
[01:49:51.689 --> 01:49:59.470]  And they point out in these studies that these viruses and things aren't in the process of making the COVID shot that's supposedly synthetic.
[01:49:59.909 --> 01:50:04.109]  They're adding it lovingly, juicily, premeditatively.
[01:50:04.909 --> 01:50:06.229]  I mean, let that sink in.
[01:50:06.329 --> 01:50:08.369]  These are some really evil bastards.
[01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:14.090]  All right, back in two minutes with the great constitutional lawyer, Bobby Barnes.

[01:54:14.779 --> 01:54:19.300]  All right, he's just on about 15, 20 minutes, and we got huge news on the COVID-19 front.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.439]  The whole house card's coming down.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.100]  I want to get into Trump coming right out, but we knew he was from our sources.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.939]  We broke this week ago, put pressure on Johnson to block the $24 billion to Ukraine until they come to the peace table.
[01:54:31.449 --> 01:54:48.409]  The big news, these preemptive pardons he's set to do to cover the Crimes Administration, this unconditional new type of pardon, get-out-of-jail-free card for Hunter as the bag man for all the crimes he was the front man for,
[01:54:48.409 --> 01:54:50.189]  and so much more.
[01:54:50.289 --> 01:54:53.489]  What is the signal they know Trump's coming after him criminally as...
[01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:57.050]  Tom Homan has said Trump has told him to do.
[01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:57.949]  This is massive.
[01:54:58.130 --> 01:55:00.229]  It shows Trump is going on the offense.
[01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:03.930]  Robert Barnes, which area of this do you want to tackle first?
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:19.779]  Well, it's a reminder of what we said all the way back in 2020. We said that the Democrats are planning this and that the president should pardon himself, should pardon all of the January 6th people, should pardon the key allies, should pardon Ed Snowden, pardon Julian Assange, and not let the Biden administration grab and seize that power.
[01:55:20.239 --> 01:55:25.020]  And he didn't because he wanted everything to be on the up and up, and he thought everything would be on the up and up in the Biden administration.
[01:55:25.119 --> 01:55:25.779]  Of course, it was not.
[01:55:25.989 --> 01:55:27.710]  And they immediately went after everybody.
[01:55:27.970 --> 01:55:29.329]  You look at how they're behaving.
[01:55:29.529 --> 01:55:30.970]  They realize they committed real crimes.
[01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:33.289]  They did what they accused Trump supporters of doing.
[01:55:33.529 --> 01:55:44.829]  So consequently, Biden is looking at mass pardons, pardons of everybody in his administration, pardons of everybody who was connected at any level to Russiagate, pardoned everybody that was connected to the Ukraine gate.
[01:55:45.289 --> 01:55:59.779]  And Ukraine is just one, as we've been talking about, as you've been mentioning for more than a decade now, Ukraine is a cesspool of money laundering, drug operations, human trafficking, secret bio labs, experimentation on people without support, eugenics in practice.
[01:56:00.159 --> 01:56:06.039]  It was an Epstein, Bill Gates kind of dream place to operate wherever you want, do whatever you want.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:11.579]  And the Biden administration and Biden himself as vice president and as president was neck deep in it.
[01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:17.029]  And so he needs to pardon everybody connected to it or because otherwise it's one of the biggest massive.
[01:56:17.229 --> 01:56:23.970]  It makes the teapot scandal look like an amateur hour at the local city government or something because the scale and scope of corruption.
[01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:25.550]  So that's where he's got to go there.
[01:56:25.689 --> 01:56:31.270]  And at the same time, you start really using that pardon power the way you look at Biden.
[01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:33.029]  He's doing it to protect his political allies.
[01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:36.010]  Trump should do it to protect the American people and constitutional liberty.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:39.359]  So create a real pardon committee, a real lawfare committee.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:46.039]  Not only pardon Steve Bannon and Julian Assange and Ed Snowden and Peter Navarro and everybody, every January 6th defendant.
[01:56:46.239 --> 01:56:48.140]  But pardon Bitcoin Jesus.
[01:56:48.359 --> 01:56:49.060]  Pardon Roger Ver.
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:57.500]  Pardon the other people that have been targeted for political reasons by this administration, which goes on in case after case after case after case.
[01:56:57.619 --> 01:57:05.420]  And then open federal civil rights investigations into all these corrupt government actors, including the corrupt government actors involved in the Infowars case.
[01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:07.789]  What exactly happened in that bankruptcy proceeding?
[01:57:08.170 --> 01:57:15.310]  What happened in the ties between state court judges doing apparently deals with movie production companies such that they're walking the red carpet?
[01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:21.250]  All of these weaponization of the legal system against ordinary people, it needs to end.
[01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:30.510]  And the only way it's gonna end is if there's massive reform, massive pardons of people who are wrongfully prosecuted, and prosecutions of the people who were involved in the wrongful targeting.
[01:57:31.079 --> 01:57:32.359]  And so I think it would be great.
[01:57:32.539 --> 01:57:33.739]  Also, politically, it's just genius.
[01:57:34.079 --> 01:57:36.039]  You get support from the crypto world.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.720]  You get support from the financial freedom world.
[01:57:37.819 --> 01:57:39.720]  You get support from the political freedom world.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.680]  You get support from a lot of libertarians.
[01:57:41.859 --> 01:57:51.359]  You can expand your coalition, deepen your coalition, broaden the base of the Trump movement, MAGA movement, so it's the second American Republic movement all over again.
[01:57:52.039 --> 01:57:55.359]  And unlike Biden, who's pardoning a bunch of real criminals.
[01:57:56.159 --> 01:58:02.279]  Trump is pardoning and protecting political heroes, and now the left can't say anything because they've done it.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.859]  That's exactly right.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:06.239]  It's perfectly situated for him.
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:11.840]  He can clean up the record and make sure our government is not complicit in cases like the Assange case.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:18.819]  Say it was the wrong case, never should have been brought, dismissed, not gonna use the pardon power to show why it never should have been brought.
[01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:20.489]  We're going to do the same with Ed Snowden.
[01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:22.869]  Whistleblowers should be protected, not prosecuted.
[01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:29.489]  Under both Obama and Biden, they prosecuted more whistleblowers than anybody in American history, than all of our prior presidents combined.
[01:58:29.770 --> 01:58:30.529]  Send a message.
[01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:31.810]  We're going to protect whistleblowers.
[01:58:31.909 --> 01:58:33.069]  We're going to protect the Assange's.
[01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:34.369]  We're going to protect the Snowden's.
[01:58:34.449 --> 01:58:37.029]  We're going to protect the Bitcoin Jesus, Roger Veres of the world.
[01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:44.510]  We're not going to prosecute them and punish them for trying to make America a safer, better government and our world a safer, better freedom.
[01:58:44.729 --> 01:58:45.069]  That's right.
[01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:47.289]  I'm glad you got into that angle because I meant to raise that as well.
[01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:51.529]  That is really the key for Trump world, America's rebirth.
[01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:53.470]  But then what does Trump do to the deep state?
[01:58:53.670 --> 01:58:54.329]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:57.630]  We are now into our number three.
[01:58:57.890 --> 01:59:06.649]  We're in the deep dive on the biggest cub of tyranny news ever coming out as the deep state house of cards continues to fall at light speed.
[01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:12.069]  Constitutional lawyer, really smart historian, and good friend of mine Robert Barnes has popped in though.
[01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:21.189]  We're good to go.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.960]  But then with the Biden people, these are real crimes.
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:41.899]  Can't the state courts and the state attorney generals taking a playbook from the Democrats going after Trump supporters for non-crimes?
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.819]  They've committed real crimes, arrogantly believing they were invincible, doing it prima facie, out in the open, open and shut.
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.460]  So there's two tracks here.
[01:59:49.619 --> 01:59:55.619]  Trump does all these pardons to get more whistleblowers to come out, to collapse the deep state's main threat.
[01:59:56.479 --> 01:59:59.380]  So the carrot to the Patriots, but the stick to the deep state.
[01:59:59.939 --> 02:00:01.939]  Tom Homan saying, no, we got task force.
[02:00:02.079 --> 02:00:09.500]  We're criminally going after his administration, not just the NGOs, not just the UN. I mean, yes, go on the offense against the deep state, on the defense against the Patriots.
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:11.619]  Barnes, elaborate on that.
[02:00:12.079 --> 02:00:14.439]  You've already gotten into protecting the Patriots.
[02:00:15.039 --> 02:00:18.479]  What's the legal skinny on Biden these actions?
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:21.000]  Is it unconstitutional?
[02:00:21.239 --> 02:00:31.119]  What system would attack that, or does Trump not attack that, and then use that to protect his people, but then separately then do the state courts come after these people that have been federally pardoned on the Democrat side?
[02:00:31.979 --> 02:00:33.119]  Yeah, so two aspects there.
[02:00:33.239 --> 02:00:35.920]  One is I believe the pardon power is very broad.
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:37.579]  That's what our founders believed in.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.140]  So you can do preemptive pardons.
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.739]  You can do proactive pardons.
[02:00:40.779 --> 02:00:42.239]  You can do pardons before there's indictments.
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.800]  You can do pardons for any time frame.
[02:00:43.939 --> 02:00:46.220]  You can do pardons for things that can't even be prosecuted.
[02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:54.560]  That pardon power is very broad, and it needs to be because we need the president to make sure to be the final arbiter of justice to prevent injustice from occurring.
[02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:56.710]  And so he can definitely do it.
[02:00:56.949 --> 02:01:00.729]  He can do preemptive pardons of everybody related, everybody in Trump world.
[02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:02.170]  So this never happens again.
[02:01:02.329 --> 02:01:04.229]  So this is not a risk four years from now.
[02:01:05.409 --> 02:01:18.029]  So be proactive, continue to use the power to protect patriots and free political prisoners like Roger Ver, like Julian Assange, like Ed Snowden, like these other folks, like all the January 6th defendants, every single one of which is a political prisoner.
[02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:20.890]  No matter what they are accused of, they're a political prisoner.
[02:01:21.010 --> 02:01:22.829]  You can't look at their cases and conclude anything different.
[02:01:23.079 --> 02:01:28.600]  We have a bunch of political prisoners in America, which is an embarrassment to the world as to who America is supposed to be.
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:30.819]  We're supposed to be the one country that doesn't have political prisoners.
[02:01:31.039 --> 02:01:32.180]  And yet now we got tons of them.
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:33.720]  So we need to free them and do it.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.220]  Now the second part, you're absolutely right.
[02:01:35.399 --> 02:01:36.359]  There needs to be a stick.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.840]  We need to deter the deep state from doing what they did.
[02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:44.529]  Now, if Biden comes in and preemptively pardons them, that means they're off the criminal prosecution risk.
[02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:48.489]  What they're not, though, is off civil suit risk.
[02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:52.109]  What they're not is off of civil rights lawsuits risk.
[02:01:52.329 --> 02:01:55.090]  What they're not is going after them monetarily.
[02:01:55.409 --> 02:01:59.250]  And to me, it's always been key, cut off the money.
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.119]  So cut off the money to the NGOs.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.100]  Cut off the money to these corrupt actors.
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:07.359]  People who were corrupt in government shouldn't be getting a taxpayer pension.
[02:02:07.619 --> 02:02:15.439]  Their pension should be taken away from them if they're engaged in that kind of illicit behavior against the American people that they were being paid to protect and promote.
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:19.760]  So come up with creative ways to make sure there's still consequence to those people.
[02:02:20.119 --> 02:02:24.579]  And more importantly, institutionally change things to cut off the money.
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.859]  It's the old Watergate story.
[02:02:27.979 --> 02:02:28.439]  Follow the money.
[02:02:28.579 --> 02:02:30.760]  Well, that's true of all of this corruption in Washington.
[02:02:31.039 --> 02:02:37.380]  You've been highlighting, without the NGOs, the US and the UN, we don't have an immigration crisis in America.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:39.039]  So go after them.
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:39.880]  Let them know.
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:45.739]  And what that does, it deters and discourages others from even thinking about it, from even contemplating it, from even considering it.
[02:02:45.939 --> 02:02:54.569]  And then, if he decides not to pardon George Soros, Biden, or people like Bill Gates, Then those people need to be on the list.
[02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:56.390]  I mean, Anthony Fauci needs to be on the list.
[02:02:56.489 --> 02:03:00.850]  These are high profile criminals who have engaged in mass murder, because that's what it really is.
[02:03:01.289 --> 02:03:07.449]  Hundreds of thousands, millions of people are dead because of the bad acts of Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, and George Soros.
[02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:11.550]  There needs to be consequence for that for people to believe in the future of our government.
[02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:19.510]  Now, if in our society, so if Biden comes in and protects them from criminal prosecution, you're right, it doesn't protect them from state prosecution.
[02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:23.489]  But even more importantly, Go after them civilly, monetarily.
[02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:34.529]  Go find ways to sue them for civil rights violations, take away pensions that they don't deserve and don't belong, their ongoing connections, ongoing activities put under meaningful investigation.
[02:03:34.529 --> 02:03:36.109]  Look at civil rights injunctions.
[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:48.270]  Look at all the things that the Biden administration did to try to prevent an honest election in 2024. Well, those tools we can use against the bad actors to prevent and prohibit them and punish them for their bad acts.
[02:03:48.529 --> 02:03:53.670]  So there's still tools available to the president, even if Biden preemptively pardons him.
[02:03:53.789 --> 02:03:58.069]  And if Biden's preemptively pardoning Bill Gates, then you know how guilty Bill Gates really is.
[02:04:00.559 --> 02:04:00.939]  Absolutely.
[02:04:01.319 --> 02:04:10.399]  And one other big angle on this, and I want to briefly hear your take on Trump's actions cutting off the Ukraine funding $24 billion, showing he really is delivering on what he said he would do.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:18.220]  The fact that the deep state is doing all these preemptive pardons, getting everybody ready for that, that shows they know because they got Trump's phones and everything tapped.
[02:04:19.059 --> 02:04:21.600]  They know that means he's for real coming after them.
[02:04:21.699 --> 02:04:22.520]  This isn't just talk.
[02:04:22.739 --> 02:04:23.479]  And that's good.
[02:04:23.619 --> 02:04:25.720]  I say, let them know we're coming for them.
[02:04:25.979 --> 02:04:27.659]  That puts the fear of God into them.
[02:04:27.819 --> 02:04:32.380]  It's got people on the inside that are on the fence about serving evil, joining us, or at least standing down.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.560]  The good guys gives them courage to come out.
[02:04:34.779 --> 02:04:35.600]  That's the right move.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.880]  I say, always let your enemy know, on guard, we're coming for you.
[02:04:40.159 --> 02:04:40.840]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:45.579]  And if he sticks to his guns, then he will get a lot of compliance.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:52.279]  He'll get people that are bad actors with bad intentions who decide maybe now is not the time to act on those bad acts and bad intentions.
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:58.460]  We'll get some folks to decide maybe they need to take a vacation from the US for a while, or from politics and government role for a while.
[02:04:58.899 --> 02:05:00.420]  And that's what needs to be done.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:08.659]  If you have bad acts, bad intentions, and you have a history of it, and you're trying to undermine America, you're gonna pay a price, or you need to step back.
[02:05:08.739 --> 02:05:11.100]  This is what Putin did, by the way, when he took over Russia.
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:18.039]  Went to put all the oligarchs in a room together and said, look, you can keep what you stole, but you gotta quit stealing.
[02:05:18.439 --> 02:05:25.100]  And if you don't interfere in the ability for us to restore Russia, then you won't face any consequence.
[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:28.439]  If you do, you're gonna get a 10-year free trip to a jail in Siberia.
[02:05:28.819 --> 02:05:31.800]  And that's how Putin was able to change things in Russia the way he wanted to.
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:34.199]  So, here there needs to be consequences.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.720]  There has to be, or at least the risk of consequences.
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:42.359]  But as important as the individual consequences, has got to be cut off the money.
[02:05:42.539 --> 02:05:47.279]  We gotta cut off the cash, take away the money, and it all disappears overnight.
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:49.920]  Because that's what all these corrupt actors, that's what ties them together.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:53.859]  At the end of the day, a lot of your deep state neocons don't really have any real principles.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:59.600]  They're control freaks, they're greed freaks, but they're as much greed freaks as they are control freaks.
[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:00.539]  Look at Bill Gates.
[02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:03.500]  Bill Gates has to create a foundation that somehow makes him money.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:07.859]  Who's ever heard of a charity that makes profit for its owner, for its founder?
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:08.779]  That's Bill Gates.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:15.180]  So make all these people face serious investigation, public scrutiny, but cut off the money, cut off the money now.
[02:06:15.399 --> 02:06:23.020]  And that will be the key to being able to restore the American Republic and Trump to deliver on the promises of this presidential election.
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:28.000]  Robert Barnes, how do people find your great podcasts and the shows you do?
[02:06:28.619 --> 02:06:33.899]  Yeah, they can find all the content at vivabarneslaw.locals.com.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:50.560]  In closing, does this show that the Speaker of the House is now Playing ball with Trump, the fact that, you know, obviously Trump threatened her diplomatic channels weeks ago to cut off Zelensky's funding if he didn't go ahead and try to declare a ceasefire.
[02:06:51.039 --> 02:06:53.399]  Zelensky didn't do it, so now Trump's cut off $24 billion.
[02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.220]  What do you think of Johnson?
[02:06:55.359 --> 02:06:57.779]  Do you think that's going to get Zelensky and his handler's attention?
[02:06:58.810 --> 02:06:59.470]  I think so.
[02:06:59.569 --> 02:07:02.050]  I think Zelensky knows that they're on the clock.
[02:07:02.609 --> 02:07:09.930]  I mean, and Zelensky's just looking at his Hollywood bailout deal for his homes in Miami and Europe and Monaco and Beverly Hills, which are already set up.
[02:07:10.090 --> 02:07:16.569]  I'm sure he's ready to get out of the – he sees this as a long movie roll because that's who the guy is, and he's ready for the movie roll to be over.
[02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:23.970]  So he's trying to figure out which script to follow and what his deep state promoters, other people saying other things.
[02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:26.250]  He knows Trump's view is the war's got to end.
[02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:28.909]  And if he doesn't end it, he's done.
[02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:31.810]  And so he's on the clock for that either way.
[02:07:31.930 --> 02:07:33.630]  But they will try to play it out.
[02:07:33.869 --> 02:07:44.550]  And as warned today by a range of high-profile people, there is clearly concern that the Biden administration will try to trigger World War III with Putin just to preclude and prohibit.
[02:07:44.909 --> 02:07:50.350]  The president from getting his peace deal by mid-January, which is already afoot.
[02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:59.470]  The president's already got major peace deals in works, in the progress, and we're gonna see them in February as long as the deep state doesn't nuke the world in the interim.
[02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:01.930]  Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:08:02.250 --> 02:08:11.289]  If Trump would have gotten in eight years ago and they hadn't attacked him and demonized him, he was ready to work with everybody and thought, oh, the power structure just is stupid.
[02:08:11.489 --> 02:08:15.670]  I'll make them all more money and we'll be successful and they'll let me turn America around.
[02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:16.470]  No, they don't want that.
[02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:19.130]  They want poverty and control for the general public.
[02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:20.369]  They want depopulation.
[02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.970]  They want tyranny.
[02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:28.609]  Now he's had nine years, you know, it was a campaign before that, really ten years to be fully baptized in the enemy fire.
[02:08:29.409 --> 02:08:44.270]  And he said that, and now he's really educated, and now surrounded by super patriots, the legion of doom, according to the globalists, because it is their doom, and he's sitting on all cylinders, and then they tried to kill him and target his family.
[02:08:44.489 --> 02:08:48.149]  I mean, they have really, really asked for it.
[02:08:48.289 --> 02:08:52.770]  From your research and observing them in closing, what is the mindset of the globalists?
[02:08:52.829 --> 02:08:53.649]  Because I see them...
[02:08:54.590 --> 02:09:02.149]  Trying to hype up civil war, trying to claim Trump's coming to kill him in the military, trying to hype up uprisings, even CNN said yesterday, because he's Hitler.
[02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:04.109]  That dog's not going to hunt.
[02:09:04.949 --> 02:09:06.590]  They're trying to pull the rug out from the economy.
[02:09:06.729 --> 02:09:07.369]  That's a threat.
[02:09:07.569 --> 02:09:09.069]  They're trying to hype up new viruses.
[02:09:09.369 --> 02:09:10.930]  They're trying to get World War III going.
[02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:15.069]  How's it going for the new world order?
[02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:30.090]  I mean, they were shocked by the election results, and they're terrified of what a Trump administration reform could be, particularly when it has people like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert Kennedy, Vivek Ramaswamy, Elon Musk, those kind of people being part of it.
[02:09:30.329 --> 02:09:33.289]  And so that has, and Kash Patel, that has them terrified.
[02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:45.010]  So right now, it looks like they're trying to just redo the old script From 2016, where after Trump got in, they tried to sabotage Flynn, pick off a few people here or there.
[02:09:45.289 --> 02:09:46.750]  They got Gates out.
[02:09:47.010 --> 02:09:49.010]  And I think that guy gave him too much confidence.
[02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:51.250]  So they thought they could get rid of Pete Hegseth.
[02:09:51.409 --> 02:09:53.609]  And they thought after that, they get rid of Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:09:53.770 --> 02:10:01.409]  And after that, get rid of RFK. Get rid of the big named reformers that have a lot of political currency in the country as independent reformers.
[02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:05.949]  I mean, it's about people have millions of supporters in Kennedy and Gabbard as just two examples.
[02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:08.109]  Who helped put Trump over the top in the election.
[02:10:08.449 --> 02:10:09.970]  Trump's committed to not letting that happen.
[02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:13.989]  And I think they thought, hey, we can just do the same scam on him again.
[02:10:14.369 --> 02:10:15.810]  I mean, Trump's like, no, not interested.
[02:10:16.050 --> 02:10:18.489]  And credit to Pete Hegson, who did not step down.
[02:10:19.050 --> 02:10:25.489]  I mean, they're trying to both Borkham, Kavanaugh and Trump at the same time.
[02:10:25.649 --> 02:10:26.470]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:32.789]  It's fake allegations of fake cases of anonymous sources that are refuted and rebutted repeatedly.
[02:10:33.119 --> 02:10:43.739]  And you have to ask yourself why, because they don't want the Secretary of Defense to care more about the American soldier and the American people than foreign governments and deep state corrupt actors, because they know what that means.
[02:10:43.899 --> 02:10:49.220]  They don't want Tulsi Gabbard in control of national intelligence and being able to coordinate it to see what's really going on.
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:54.380]  They don't want Robert Kennedy digging into public health controversy and the dangers of our vaccines and other drugs.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:56.560]  So Trump, just stick to it.
[02:10:56.939 --> 02:11:04.579]  Just keep your backbone tight and make sure the Republican establishment knows if you don't go along, there's gonna be consequences for all of you.
[02:11:04.739 --> 02:11:07.199]  And that's where I think, you know who should be on that list?
[02:11:07.399 --> 02:11:09.800]  Who Biden really should be adding to the pardon list?
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.319]  Mitch McConnell and his wife.
[02:11:11.579 --> 02:11:14.619]  Some of the most highly corrupt Republican senators and congressmen.
[02:11:15.039 --> 02:11:16.960]  People like- Absolutely.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:18.899]  Well, the Great Awakening's here.
[02:11:19.039 --> 02:11:19.579]  It's incredible.
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:20.460]  It's a historic time.
[02:11:20.579 --> 02:11:21.300]  Super dangerous as well.
[02:11:21.399 --> 02:11:22.079]  God bless you.
[02:11:22.239 --> 02:11:23.340]  Robert Barnes, talk to you soon.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:24.779]  Hey, glad to be here, Alex.
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:25.460]  Thank you.
[02:11:25.659 --> 02:11:29.420]  Alright, into the next hour, Dr. Judy Mikevitz is our guest.
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:34.159]  And I'm just so honored to have her with us.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.960]  As soon as I saw this news break the last 48 hours, we had to get her on.
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:47.079]  You can go to drjudy, A-M-I-K-O-V-I-T-S on X or thereal drjudy.com.
[02:11:47.239 --> 02:11:49.800]  She is a best-selling author and just an incredible lady.
[02:11:49.859 --> 02:11:52.020]  Without going to her old story, she worked inside the government.
[02:11:52.199 --> 02:11:53.880]  She worked inside the top laboratory.
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.500]  She discovered what Fauci was doing.
[02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:59.310]  And if we had the crew, because we have a great crew, but it's been crushed down to almost nothing.
[02:11:59.350 --> 02:12:00.689]  It's why we need your support to expand back.
[02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:16.750]  I would have had a crew, like I used to have a few extra people, go get the clips of her three and a half, four years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, explaining that so-called COVID shot doesn't just have the spike protein and make your body replicate this thing that cuts up your DNA so you can't repair.
[02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:22.289]  It's full of all these deadly cancer viruses like the SV40. Well, now we've got...
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:37.680]  We're good to go.
[02:12:45.329 --> 02:12:58.649]  Joining us now to talk about all of this, we also have Hotez, who's now the new Fauci, coming out saying, don't worry, Trump is going to be hit between the eyes.
[02:12:59.090 --> 02:13:03.050]  It's all going to come, quote, crashing down on Trump's new administration January 21st.
[02:13:03.979 --> 02:13:04.640]  That's a quote.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:10.520]  So, just like Fauci said, don't worry when Trump was first elected.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.300]  He'll be hit by a new pandemic that'll get him off balance real quick.
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:28.579]  So, it's all coming out that all the kids with new heart problems, major British study, Harvard study, Oxford study, 1.7 million kids with heart problems, from the shots, only the kids with the shots.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:32.199]  I mean, it is insane, the open nakedness of the crimes.
[02:13:33.099 --> 02:13:39.239]  Master death cult leaders like Gates believe the world couldn't face the horror, but they are, thanks to Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.939]  And so she joins us to talk about this and so much more.
[02:13:44.119 --> 02:13:49.039]  We'll show you electron microscope scans of the cancer viruses replicating in your body.
[02:13:49.239 --> 02:13:52.439]  The weapon turns off your immune system and then attacks you with the cancer.
[02:13:52.479 --> 02:13:54.960]  And as she said, they dump everything they've got.
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:14:01.270]  She said, in fact, I want listeners on X to Take this live interview.
[02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:03.489]  Take it with this archive this afternoon because I don't have the crew anymore.
[02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:06.189]  And they're working 18 hours a day some days.
[02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:13.090]  Go get all her last interviews with me and all the others she did and show where she said everything word for word four years ago.
[02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:14.489]  It was actually four years ago on this show.
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:19.779]  Hell, she said before COVID, her book was already written and then published after it, all of this.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:26.060]  So she's here, the absolute most vindicated person in all of this.
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:33.539]  It's not about kissing her butt, it's about celebrating that we wouldn't know all of this without her, and now it's so vindicated.
[02:14:34.979 --> 02:14:37.220]  And it's not just this stupid, it's a whole bunch of them.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:38.819]  This is insane.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:41.300]  But it's hard to believe, but it's real.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:44.300]  Dr. Mikovits, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:14:45.890 --> 02:14:46.489]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:14:46.689 --> 02:14:48.069]  It's good to be here again.
[02:14:48.630 --> 02:15:03.109]  I don't know if it's good today because what you showed me last night or what I got last night is upsetting and difficult to even describe the level of frustration with this McCullough so-called study.
[02:15:04.670 --> 02:15:05.850]  All right, well, let's start.
[02:15:05.989 --> 02:15:11.289]  Let's start because, I mean, you've been there saying they're dumping SV40 and all these viruses into the COVID shot.
[02:15:12.449 --> 02:15:13.590]  Break it down for us.
[02:15:14.529 --> 02:15:16.890]  Well, the problem is which COVID shot?
[02:15:17.529 --> 02:15:27.409]  The SARS-CoV-2 was injected in every polio vaccine since 2004 when it was created in a collaboration.
[02:15:27.670 --> 02:15:29.229]  It's the Moore et al.
[02:15:29.369 --> 02:15:30.489]  paper on our website.
[02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:32.949]  We've shown it several times to you.
[02:15:33.130 --> 02:15:35.229]  You know, which COVID shot?
[02:15:35.710 --> 02:15:39.250]  You know, the hepatitis B vaccine, which...
[02:15:39.250 --> 02:15:39.409]  Exactly.
[02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:42.350]  So you explain to people that this has been their weapon for a long time.
[02:15:42.689 --> 02:15:43.829]  They're just doing it...
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.600]  So now what you've got, or at least what I saw last night, the paper of Peter McCullough.
[02:15:50.939 --> 02:15:53.319]  It's disingenuous at best.
[02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:56.850]  And all I could think of all night long was fraud.
[02:15:57.310 --> 02:16:00.829]  And how many more will be murdered in experimentation?
[02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:06.529]  Remember the Children's Health Defense article from December 1st, 2020. Yeah.
[02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:16.430]  Resolution of refractory COVID-19 vaccine-induced myopericarditis with adjunctive rapamycin.
[02:16:17.050 --> 02:16:21.569]  Which COVID-19 vaccine induced pericarditis?
[02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:24.109]  I can read through the sentence.
[02:16:24.710 --> 02:16:26.010]  Commonly encountered.
[02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:34.829]  So now these shots, every shot since hepatitis B, Has been a COVID-19 shot.
[02:16:35.290 --> 02:16:50.770]  And every shot since our 2009 paper, October 23rd, showing all of these monkey, mouse, kidney, mRNA, DNA, protein, as you said,
[02:16:50.930 --> 02:17:00.569]  SB40, cytomegalovirus causing the neuro, the brain tumors in the promoters, in these synthetic molecular constructs.
[02:17:00.719 --> 02:17:07.260]  Where they're literally only the spike protein being expressed in a synthetic virus.
[02:17:07.579 --> 02:17:09.420]  Which COVID shot?
[02:17:09.719 --> 02:17:18.540]  And then they go on to say this is a, okay, you induce the myocarditis, which we appreciate at the molecular level.
[02:17:19.059 --> 02:17:29.440]  It's a sodium chloride channel called SCN4A and 5A. 4A is in the brain, the loop, and 5A is in the heart.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:42.379]  So the work that we did at the Neuroimmune Institute that I co-founded and literally from the ground up, the diagnostic test, 2006, showing all of this.
[02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:45.090]  You know, rapamycin, adjunctive.
[02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:50.329]  No, we tried to use rapamycin in the injury cause.
[02:17:50.510 --> 02:17:52.170]  This is an autistic kid.
[02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:56.850]  This autistic kid should have never been injected with anything again.
[02:17:57.350 --> 02:17:58.989]  I understand you're a scientist.
[02:17:59.489 --> 02:18:01.649]  This goes above a lot of people's heads, including mine.
[02:18:02.409 --> 02:18:05.770]  Bottom line, bottom line, you've explained this before, so I'm going to put words in your mouth.
[02:18:06.450 --> 02:18:09.569]  I think?
[02:18:33.319 --> 02:18:33.799]  Correct.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:39.680]  And then you activate the latent viruses they were already injected with.
[02:18:39.879 --> 02:18:42.940]  This was the HIV-AIDS knowledge.
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:56.280]  SARS-CoV-2 could not possibly cause COVID. So even just writing that first sentence of that paper and then saying disease management with natto kinase, which isn't a natto and isn't a kinase.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.799]  Well, moving on from this, I mean, I saw the study and thought, oh, here they are, from what you're saying about all these cancer viruses in there.
[02:19:04.159 --> 02:19:06.600]  Okay, instead of, and we'll get into the study as much as you want.
[02:19:06.719 --> 02:19:23.000]  I understand you know a lot more than just this study, and I've seen from all the documents that what you're saying is true, but what I'm trying to explain to people is, and a way they can understand because they're not a scientist like you, is that it's not just that they give you the new spike protein shots that turn off your immune system.
[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:26.059]  And then add new cancer viruses to do it there.
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:32.780]  You're saying once it turns it off, it then allows all this stuff we were already injected with in previous shots to then become activated.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:33.799]  That's really important.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:37.040]  And attack those same pathways.
[02:19:37.579 --> 02:19:39.159]  What is rapamycin?
[02:19:39.319 --> 02:19:42.020]  Your key energetic pathway in your body.
[02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:45.379]  It's associated with mTOR.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:49.020]  It's called the mammalian target of rapamycin.
[02:19:49.139 --> 02:20:01.969]  And We've tried and successfully used and developed hundreds of papers in every COVID-associated cancer, in Alzheimer's disease, in dementia.
[02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:04.489]  This kid has autism.
[02:20:05.059 --> 02:20:22.059]  Meaning he already needed rapamycin for the mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin, something that had no control by the FDA, and that was denied use.
[02:20:22.459 --> 02:20:26.819]  When it actually synergizes with ivermectin.
[02:20:27.079 --> 02:20:33.459]  And in fact, we've used it, me personally, literally handing it to these kids in Autism One.
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:39.520]  We've developed this since 2010 at the Autism One meetings with many experts.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:43.219]  Sure, and that's your frustration, is decades ago you're exposing all this before it all comes out.
[02:20:43.319 --> 02:20:44.639]  You know the cures, you know the treatments.
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:46.760]  And we're going to go to the break, come back and talk about this.
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:49.680]  Bill Gates says we'll never find a coronavirus cure.
[02:20:50.239 --> 02:20:54.120]  That was in October 2020. So he's telling you take the shot.
[02:20:54.299 --> 02:21:05.079]  It will cure you while separately saying in his own foundation and in the NIH that there'll never be a cure because they flooded everybody with all these cancer viruses, but there are cures.
[02:21:05.079 --> 02:21:07.659]  So it's lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[02:21:08.229 --> 02:21:10.250]  And SARS-CoV-2 is not a coronavirus.
[02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:11.610]  It's a retrovirus.
[02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:15.690]  It's part HIV. That's the paper you just showed, pseudotyping.
[02:21:15.930 --> 02:21:17.030]  Let's walk through it.
[02:21:17.129 --> 02:21:22.350]  It's HIV, XMRV, and SARS. It never was a coronavirus, and that's the big lie.
[02:21:22.569 --> 02:21:23.270]  Kevin, let's stop there.
[02:21:23.629 --> 02:21:25.590]  You were the first to expose all this.
[02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:29.389]  Remember, we don't have science degrees like you.
[02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:30.149]  We're not a famous...
[02:21:30.149 --> 02:21:30.690]  I'm serious.
[02:21:30.989 --> 02:21:33.069]  So you just talk to me like I'm five years old.
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:35.559]  And just explain the history when we come back.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:36.639 --> 02:21:42.700]  Dr. Judy Mikovits is the OG. She is absolutely the most informed person on the subject.
[02:21:43.059 --> 02:21:43.420]  We'll be right back.
[02:21:43.459 --> 02:21:43.799]  Stay with us.
[02:21:43.979 --> 02:21:46.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is back on the air.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:48.000]  The judge is having emergency hearings.
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.139]  Looks like their fraudulent sale won't go through.
[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:57.600]  But regardless, I'm suing the daylights of the Democratic Party and the big national gun control group that's actually behind the onion and has now admitted it in court.
[02:21:57.870 --> 02:22:00.510]  So, we also have backup studios, the Alex Jones Network.
[02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:07.629]  Whatever they do, we're staying on air to make sure Trump gets into office and to back him and his agenda to stop World War III, secure the borders and more.
[02:22:07.709 --> 02:22:09.489]  But we can't do it without your support.
[02:22:09.629 --> 02:22:17.030]  So there are all these new, amazing, incredible designs up on thealexjonesstore.com that has nothing to do with InfoWars.
[02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:19.930]  It's not owned by me, so they can never get that.
[02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:23.250]  That's how we stay on the air, even if they're successful in shutting us down.
[02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:33.809]  If you go to thealexjonesstore.com and you get great supplements, t-shirts, limited edition collectible fundraiser, posters, and more, you will keep me on the air regardless of the Alex Jones Network.
[02:22:34.069 --> 02:22:38.489]  Please go to the site now, thealexjonesstore.com and keep us on air.
[02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:39.670]  They're amazing products.
[02:22:39.850 --> 02:22:41.170]  Thank you so much for taking action.
[02:22:41.350 --> 02:22:42.270]  You are the resistance.
[02:22:43.659 --> 02:22:49.180]  All right, I want to go over the history of what's really going on with these so-called vaccines, all these big studies coming out.
[02:22:50.269 --> 02:22:56.090]  Prestigious ones, and obviously Dr. Megavits who exposed this whole first says, look, this is the scratch of the surface.
[02:22:56.090 --> 02:22:56.989]  I get her frustration.
[02:22:57.629 --> 02:23:01.170]  My point is, is they're saying they're full of deadly cancer viruses.
[02:23:01.569 --> 02:23:05.090]  The spike protein turns off your immune system and then these things attack.
[02:23:05.350 --> 02:23:06.930]  She's like, that's a diversion.
[02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:08.989]  You're already loaded up with it.
[02:23:09.069 --> 02:23:14.010]  Your body's already repaired it because it has its DNA. The spike protein turns it off so they reemerge.
[02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.469]  Kind of like...
[02:23:14.969 --> 02:23:19.010]  You already had herpes, your body beats it for a while, you get stressed, it comes back.
[02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:25.430]  Or you had a bad wart infection, the doctor removed it, that's viral cancer, it's benign.
[02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:29.170]  You get really run down, get sick, warts come back.
[02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:32.489]  Okay, most people don't seem to know that most cancer is viral.
[02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:38.110]  But they discovered this 100 years ago, and the Rockefellers were obsessed with it, and they've been doing this since the beginning.
[02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:41.290]  Cancer was rare 100 years ago for those that don't know, just like autism.
[02:23:42.159 --> 02:23:44.520]  Okay, you didn't even have a name for it until the 70s.
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:48.180]  So now to recap this, the new developments, then I want to hit all the other angles.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:51.020]  We'll keep you at some of the next hour because we could have you for 10 hours here.
[02:23:51.319 --> 02:23:57.920]  And I understand it's frustrating for you to know so much and, you know, talk to folks here that know more than the general public, but it's still complex.
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:24:01.379]  But just a brief history of this and what these new studies coming out.
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:07.159]  My point is that even if they're not hardcore enough, It's still a good thing, you know, vindicating.
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:08.180]  You've already been vindicated.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:11.159]  My point is, it gets people waking up in concern.
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:18.079]  And then I want to move into, Hotez is the new spokesman for the WEF, for the WHO. He's replaced Fauci.
[02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:22.600]  And he is saying, oh, don't worry, a new virus is going to crush Trump and stop his agenda.
[02:24:22.899 --> 02:24:26.020]  And he goes and just fear-mongers a whole list of viruses.
[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:26.940]  So I want to get to that.
[02:24:27.159 --> 02:24:29.520]  Coming up and get your take on what you think they're planning.
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.159]  Dr. Mikevitz, please continue.
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.879]  Well, this always was infection by injection.
[02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:38.540]  Vaccination is not immunization.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:42.440]  This is a 2017 book.
[02:24:43.319 --> 02:24:45.159]  2017 book.
[02:24:47.579 --> 02:24:54.319]  We sat in Jason Chaffetz's office and showed him absolutely all of this vaccination injury.
[02:24:54.739 --> 02:25:06.100]  Every piece of data and the we was doctors two by two, including Bobby Kennedy, including Jack Lionsweiler, including Nation of Islam, Dr. Ali Muhammad with type 1 interferons.
[02:25:06.239 --> 02:25:15.840]  We showed them the rapamycins, the cures, the things that existed, the treatments, the ivermectins, the things the FDA had no control over, none, absolutely none.
[02:25:16.049 --> 02:25:22.629]  We showed them all the cures and all the oral and nasal immunization, true immunization strategies.
[02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:36.729]  This SARS-CoV-2 could not possibly have caused COVID if it was injected in every polio vaccine since 2004. That is what that paper you just showed showed.
[02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:46.940]  So now you injected a 23-year-old child And they said he was perfectly healthy.
[02:25:47.159 --> 02:25:48.620]  No, he wasn't.
[02:25:48.739 --> 02:25:58.180]  He was vaccine injured, the very pathway, mTOR, your key energy producing pathway in your brain.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.239]  Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, every cancer associated.
[02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:09.549]  Synergies between low-dose ivermectin, a WIT pathway inhibitor, and rapamycin.
[02:26:09.729 --> 02:26:19.129]  And we've done it over and over and over again, giving the people the curative oral and nasal true therapies and immunizations.
[02:26:19.389 --> 02:26:24.610]  And now you've got a case report that somehow says we need more research.
[02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:33.209]  No, we need the lies to stop spreading that vaccination ever had anything to do with immunization.
[02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:37.290]  Yeah, 1972. What's the problem?
[02:26:37.409 --> 02:26:38.870]  You can't patent it.
[02:26:39.129 --> 02:26:50.030]  And so the FDA has absolutely no authority over our use of rapamycin, just like ivermectin, just like Sermon or anything else.
[02:26:50.489 --> 02:27:06.170]  Double-blind placebo-controlled study of Sermon by Bob Navio in 2015. And somehow, Bayer Monsanto took that away from everyone and stopped us from using a simple oral strategy to end autism.
[02:27:06.250 --> 02:27:10.329]  And here now, we've experimented on a 23-year-old.
[02:27:10.430 --> 02:27:11.430]  He's not healthy.
[02:27:11.610 --> 02:27:13.729]  He's vaccine-injured.
[02:27:14.229 --> 02:27:25.629]  And you use the same thing that somebody should have used 20 years ago before you injected him with a COVID-19 shot, before you injected SARS-CoV-2.
[02:27:25.909 --> 02:27:28.610]  Did he get it from his polio shots?
[02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:38.010]  Did anybody look at the rest of the shots in this so-called case report and take a look and see how to genuinely heal that boy?
[02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:49.930]  I guarantee you ivermectin and rapamycin and cardiomiracal, which actually hits Every one of those pathogenic pathways, and this is the AI, the functional analysis.
[02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:53.389]  See, they're just reinventing the wheel, just like they did.
[02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:56.049]  HIV caused AIDS. Everybody's gonna die.
[02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.989]  No, they didn't.
[02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:58.510]  Oh, yeah, repurpose.
[02:27:58.610 --> 02:27:59.610]  You don't need to repurpose it.
[02:27:59.610 --> 02:28:04.530]  And that's why they always keep Fauci in there for 45 years, because he's been one of the key people involved.
[02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:05.629]  It's his project.
[02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:06.950]  Correct.
[02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:10.829]  You have absolutely no authority over that drug.
[02:28:11.010 --> 02:28:12.909]  We don't need to repurpose anything.
[02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:30.969]  And remember, you said this years ago, you said they're behind the scenes blocking ivermectin, and then it came out earlier this year, $2.2 billion paid by the CDC secretly to Walgreens and to CBS and other big companies.
[02:28:31.549 --> 02:28:32.989]  We're good to go.
[02:28:32.989 --> 02:28:38.569]  We're good to go.
[02:28:38.909 --> 02:28:41.829]  We're good to go.
[02:28:42.549 --> 02:28:53.530]  And ivermectin and rapamycin synergize for all things COVID. Every cancer, every Parkinson's, Alzheimer's.
[02:28:53.629 --> 02:28:55.649]  It's insulin-like growth factor.
[02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:57.870]  It's absolutely everywhere.
[02:28:57.870 --> 02:29:03.989]  And if morons keep doing their research, I'm sorry.
[02:29:04.350 --> 02:29:07.049]  That's unconscionable.
[02:29:07.170 --> 02:29:08.930]  The best word I can think of.
[02:29:09.399 --> 02:29:10.340]  For that paper.
[02:29:10.559 --> 02:29:14.059]  Okay, well listen, I really respect Dr. Peter McCullough, but I'm not a scientist like you.
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:14.979]  I understand.
[02:29:15.139 --> 02:29:15.659]  He's not either.
[02:29:17.159 --> 02:29:18.540]  He's not either.
[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:18.860]  I understand.
[02:29:19.079 --> 02:29:20.760]  So I want to give you the chance.
[02:29:21.239 --> 02:29:24.959]  And I know I don't want to get into fighting, but I think it's okay to talk about it.
[02:29:25.159 --> 02:29:27.540]  You are this expert scientist in this area.
[02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:30.540]  So I'm sure he's learning.
[02:29:30.719 --> 02:29:31.819]  We're working with other scientists.
[02:29:33.139 --> 02:29:36.299]  Let's talk about, then briefly, your problems with this paper.
[02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:41.030]  Just walk through the abstract.
[02:29:42.559 --> 02:29:44.700]  COVID-19 is not a disease.
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:48.860]  SARS-CoV-2 can't possibly be the causative agent.
[02:29:49.139 --> 02:30:04.319]  COVID-19, every single shot since 1992. Hepatitis B. HIV is a synthetic, is an XMRV. COVID-19, all of a sudden,
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.540]  the edict in January of 2020. Oh, SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.
[02:30:09.659 --> 02:30:11.000]  It's one virus.
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.340]  No, it's not one virus.
[02:30:12.649 --> 02:30:15.049]  No, it's the hundreds of variants.
[02:30:15.350 --> 02:30:26.229]  Is it HIV Lyme from Lyme, Connecticut, that causes the girls the neuroimmune disease that killed those kids at Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza, and his mother?
[02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:31.110]  Oh, these kids are just said to have autism, as if it's a neurodevelopmental disease.
[02:30:31.229 --> 02:30:33.149]  No, it's vaccine injury.
[02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:37.010]  You injected that kid again, and now you're going to be...
[02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:37.870]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:30:38.229 --> 02:30:40.870]  And that's admitted in all these papers, is that...
[02:30:41.709 --> 02:30:46.850]  This shot basically caused myocarditis, a virus-like attack on the heart or also on the brain.
[02:30:47.430 --> 02:30:48.489]  Talk about motive.
[02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:49.930]  Why did the globalists do this?
[02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:57.690]  To kill the vaccine injured and drive another narrative?
[02:30:57.889 --> 02:31:00.530]  To make everybody forget this wasn't a coronavirus.
[02:31:00.729 --> 02:31:03.870]  This was HIV-AIDS. This is and always was.
[02:31:04.069 --> 02:31:11.430]  One day we decided HIV caused AIDS. Peter Duesberg, Bob Gallo, the corruption at the National Cancer Institute.
[02:31:11.729 --> 02:31:13.909]  AIDS is an acquired immune deficiency.
[02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:17.030]  Cancer is an acquired immune deficiency.
[02:31:18.019 --> 02:31:19.200]  They've injected it.
[02:31:19.340 --> 02:31:21.360]  They've injected it unchecked.
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.559]  By the way, that's all admitted mainline science.
[02:31:23.739 --> 02:31:24.840]  This is not even debatable.
[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:28.079]  And then this spike protein turns that off.
[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:36.620]  I mean, I have the heads of major British institutions I played bragging before they rolled out the COVID shots four years ago saying, this is going to be great.
[02:31:36.719 --> 02:31:39.280]  Once you take three shots, you have no immune system.
[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.420]  And they're just laughing about it.
[02:31:41.739 --> 02:31:42.819]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:31:42.979 --> 02:31:48.020]  Why do they brag on TV I played the clip probably 500 times, find it again.
[02:31:48.219 --> 02:31:50.879]  Why do they brag about what they're doing?
[02:31:52.479 --> 02:31:54.280]  Because it's pure evil.
[02:31:54.879 --> 02:31:56.059]  It's pure evil.
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:10.459]  And like you say, I have no problem with Peter McCullough other than his ego, other than the fact that somehow he thinks he did this and he denied and he didn't put in the references of that paper.
[02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:30.469]  Anything of the 50 years of proof that we could heal all of these diseases using synergistic ivermectin and rapamycin and looking at pathways and not poisons and targeting how our immune response heals,
[02:32:30.809 --> 02:32:32.670]  giving us true immunization.
[02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:35.790]  We can do a whole show on that or we can cover that now.
[02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:42.870]  In fairness, I think, because I'm not a scientist like you, but don't you normally just put out papers on specific slices of things?
[02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:48.030]  I mean, so if you put in a paper a bunch of—wouldn't that be another paper he should put out?
[02:32:48.250 --> 02:32:54.389]  I know you've put out a lot of papers that are excellent showing this, because, I mean, I think McCullough does admit— There's no data in that paper.
[02:32:54.569 --> 02:32:59.079]  There's no data in that paper, which spike protein— The one from 1999?
[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:01.860]  Which spike protein?
[02:33:02.059 --> 02:33:02.739]  Bring it.
[02:33:02.879 --> 02:33:03.559]  Show me.
[02:33:04.139 --> 02:33:05.319]  There's no mechanistic.
[02:33:05.319 --> 02:33:06.180]  There's no data.
[02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:07.879]  There's no data in that paper.
[02:33:08.079 --> 02:33:08.659]  It's not science.
[02:33:08.860 --> 02:33:11.219]  I didn't mean the paper to become the whole focus of this.
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:13.559]  Let me shift gears with you because I really want your take on this.
[02:33:13.889 --> 02:33:14.329]  No, it's okay.
[02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:21.049]  It's irritating because these kids could have been healed a long time ago and everybody denied it.
[02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:27.870]  And now a savior comes along and reinvents the wheel instead of handing everything the taxpayers paid for.
[02:33:28.129 --> 02:33:29.309]  50 years.
[02:33:29.549 --> 02:33:33.110]  We have hundreds of reviews to do this.
[02:33:33.250 --> 02:33:35.010]  Why can't we just do it right?
[02:33:35.909 --> 02:33:37.250]  Now, give the taxpayers back.
[02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:40.909]  Well, I think it would be a helpful, sensational interview, not a debate.
[02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:42.590]  I'll fly both you guys here.
[02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:45.190]  We can have a four-hour show, and we can all discuss this.
[02:33:45.969 --> 02:33:46.290]  Yeah.
[02:33:46.690 --> 02:33:48.389]  Okay, so just let's move on.
[02:33:48.569 --> 02:33:49.549]  I love Peter McCauley.
[02:33:49.629 --> 02:33:50.049]  He's a great guy.
[02:33:50.170 --> 02:33:51.389]  I understand that you said it's a bigger picture.
[02:33:52.450 --> 02:33:53.850]  And that's what we're here covering right now.
[02:33:53.909 --> 02:33:56.350]  I thought when I see the paper, it's like, oh, this says you're right.
[02:33:56.350 --> 02:33:58.549]  And I didn't know it would go there.
[02:33:58.610 --> 02:33:59.489]  But let me ask about this.
[02:34:00.659 --> 02:34:14.739]  We have Hotez, who is the new little, he's been there, but he's now been promoted to Fauci's role, literally saying what Fauci said in the winter of 2017, that don't worry, we'll stop Trump with a new novel virus.
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:16.280]  I want to play the clip for you.
[02:34:16.379 --> 02:34:23.379]  He is now, I'm sure you've already seen it, but for viewers that didn't, running around, and he also tells the Houston Chronicle that this is going to stop Trump.
[02:34:23.479 --> 02:34:24.579]  Trump doesn't know what's going to happen.
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:26.139]  This is going to take over his whole agenda.
[02:34:26.970 --> 02:34:28.750]  I mean, this is chilling.
[02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:32.950]  We've got some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting January 21st.
[02:34:33.450 --> 02:34:36.469]  Name's nearly a dozen new viruses that aren't new.
[02:34:36.629 --> 02:34:40.049]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st in the Trump administration.
[02:34:40.049 --> 02:34:43.610]  And as you and others said, all these people's immune systems turned off.
[02:34:44.659 --> 02:34:47.620]  They're calling in all these mystery things, quote, killing young people.
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:53.760]  But I heard you and many others predict that the people that have been shot up with this stuff now with no immune systems are going to be dropping like flies.
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:59.639]  Health officials issued dire warning as mysterious bird flu-like illness.
[02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:00.280]  Not bird flu.
[02:35:00.440 --> 02:35:07.420]  Flu-like illness kills 143. They're hyping all this other fear, magic new thing popping up in Congo.
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:10.879]  They are going in full court press to try to...
[02:35:11.519 --> 02:35:12.840]  Rope control of Trump.
[02:35:13.059 --> 02:35:19.059]  I mean, he is just chortling with glee that don't worry, we're going to save everybody from Trump because we're about to take over his agenda.
[02:35:19.059 --> 02:35:19.600]  Here it is.
[02:35:20.789 --> 02:35:30.770]  Here's the reason why we need to care about this stuff, Nicole, is that we have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[02:35:31.209 --> 02:35:35.129]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. That I'm really worried about.
[02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:40.829]  It's all over wild birds on the western part of the United States and going up in the north.
[02:35:40.829 --> 02:35:42.149]  It's getting into the poultry.
[02:35:42.350 --> 02:35:44.790]  We're seeing sporadic human cases.
[02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:47.930]  No human-to-human transmission yet, but that could happen.
[02:35:47.930 --> 02:35:48.750]  It's in the cattle.
[02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:49.510]  It's in the milk.
[02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:50.889]  And that's just the beginning.
[02:35:51.069 --> 02:35:54.770]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[02:35:54.870 --> 02:36:04.530]  We've had SARS in 2002, SARS-2 COVID-19 in 2019. And we know these viruses are jumping from bats to people thousands of times a year.
[02:36:04.879 --> 02:36:06.280]  But there's still more.
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:21.420]  We know that we have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas, or expecting dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[02:36:21.559 --> 02:36:22.440]  And there's more.
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:25.920]  Then we have all this sharp rise in vaccine-preventable doses.
[02:36:25.959 --> 02:36:31.659]  Diseases going up because of, in part, the anti-vaccine activism that's so prominent right now.
[02:36:31.799 --> 02:36:37.860]  We have a five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:41.200]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.440]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:49.959]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:54.040]  All right, Dr. Magovic, leading expert on what's really going on in the big picture.
[02:36:56.099 --> 02:36:57.340]  There's a lot of questions there.
[02:36:57.479 --> 02:36:59.299]  A, they're hyping all this fear.
[02:36:59.399 --> 02:37:00.340]  What do you think they're planning?
[02:37:00.639 --> 02:37:02.260]  You were shaking your head a lot during that.
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:03.059]  What's going on here?
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:06.020]  They're doing the exact same thing they did before.
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:08.239]  They're injecting our kids.
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:10.440]  They're targeting Trump-Kennedy supporters.
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:21.180]  Our newsletter yesterday shows you that they literally went through the records against the law and said, you have inadequate immunization.
[02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:24.139]  And now we get to inject pertussis.
[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:25.860]  Oh, you mean whooping cough?
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:26.500]  Yes.
[02:37:27.549 --> 02:37:29.010]  The vaccine that doesn't work.
[02:37:29.170 --> 02:37:35.750]  What's going on is they failed the first time and they're never going to stop injecting those deadly shots.
[02:37:35.889 --> 02:37:41.090]  Joe Lodipo and DeSantis were there saying no more COVID shots.
[02:37:41.409 --> 02:37:46.010]  Well, the Ventura County health care system went through and found Trump supporters.
[02:37:46.149 --> 02:37:53.209]  Oh, why don't we say like FEMA? And went through to their records and say you have inadequate immunization.
[02:37:53.610 --> 02:37:58.790]  No, they don't have any immunization because vaccination is not immunization.
[02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:02.829]  It's destruction and sterilization.
[02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:05.510]  Yeah, they're continuing to inject those.
[02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:10.850]  Every one of those viruses has already been injected.
[02:38:11.149 --> 02:38:14.770]  I'll show you the 2011 Wuhan paper.
[02:38:15.610 --> 02:38:18.750]  October 31st, 2011. It's in our database.
[02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:22.909]  Oh, all those viruses in that back cave, all those things that came out...
[02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:25.350]  Straight out of Fort Detrick.
[02:38:25.629 --> 02:38:26.989]  Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:28.870]  Oh yeah, so Trump's going to get it again.
[02:38:29.129 --> 02:38:31.489]  Are we the people going to let them play?
[02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:36.049]  Are we going to never let them inject anything in our children again?
[02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:42.389]  Are we going to get these criminal commercials off the TV? Are we going to stop reinventing?
[02:38:42.799 --> 02:38:52.319]  And ignore 50 years of publications and stop treating the people and pretend somehow these are vaccine-preventable diseases.
[02:38:52.639 --> 02:39:00.100]  When you injected the infectious, when you injected the disease, they don't jump to species.
[02:39:00.459 --> 02:39:02.399]  You're injecting the dogs.
[02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:04.120]  You injected the plants.
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:06.920]  You injected the eggplants.
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:10.729]  You've GMO. You've destroyed the Food supply.
[02:39:10.889 --> 02:39:12.149]  There's no bird flu.
[02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:15.229]  PCR is not a virus.
[02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:17.809]  And again, the testing, the criminal.
[02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:25.250]  If this criminal organization is not stopped, not another shot ever.
[02:39:25.729 --> 02:39:26.430]  That's not immunization.
[02:39:26.430 --> 02:39:27.290]  And let's explain this.
[02:39:27.370 --> 02:39:29.329]  They're now coming out with pharmacological crops.
[02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:31.209]  They're poisoning the whole food supply.
[02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:32.250]  They admit they're going to...
[02:39:33.909 --> 02:39:37.809]  John Kerry said months ago we've got to get rid of half the food or people are going to starve.
[02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:39.770]  They've got to shut down all the organic farms.
[02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:41.670]  They're literally at war with civilization.
[02:39:42.030 --> 02:39:48.670]  It's a depopulation cult and they admit it and they are poisoning everything and then claiming it's these viruses when it's them.
[02:39:49.639 --> 02:39:50.020]  Correct.
[02:39:50.299 --> 02:39:51.540]  There's their injections.
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:55.079]  Get these injections out, out.
[02:39:55.379 --> 02:39:57.540]  Not one single ejection.
[02:39:57.620 --> 02:39:59.100]  Well, let's talk about the dogs real quick.
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:01.020]  I never see this.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:11.780]  We have a major, quote, canine and cat vaccine maker that came out with the Tridilla astralopeto vaccine.
[02:40:12.979 --> 02:40:18.819]  And they admit that it's supposedly for a bacteria that it kills and maims massive numbers of the animals.
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:20.600]  And then the company itself pulled it.
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:23.579]  I guess people care about their dogs more than humans.
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:28.000]  And I work for a large animal vet, gosh, 30 years.
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:35.639]  We're good to go.
[02:40:51.010 --> 02:40:55.010]  Yeah, why don't I just tell you Tony Fauci and the Beagles.
[02:40:55.309 --> 02:41:08.750]  And in a meeting in the Czech Republic in 2010, when Robin Weiss and colleagues, I'll show you the data, proved contagious cancer in your dogs.
[02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:12.950]  So that when they ate the human, I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:41:13.639 --> 02:41:19.940]  The goal, dogs have more coronaviruses and retroviruses in their virome.
[02:41:20.399 --> 02:41:23.959]  And therefore, again, SARS-CoV-2 is not a coronavirus.
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:27.159]  It's part retrovirus, part mouse virus.
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:34.340]  And now they say they're coming out, they're already having pharmacological crops, cabbage, tomatoes, strawberries with the Senate.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.159]  They got FDA authorization to feed all this bioweapon stuff to cows.
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:40.659]  I mean, they're just hitting everything right now.
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:43.639]  Yeah, yeah, and we need to stop it.
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:45.979]  And we the people need to stop it.
[02:41:46.059 --> 02:41:50.920]  And I know Bobby Kennedy can, but not unless we the people say no more.
[02:41:51.159 --> 02:41:58.600]  Nobody's coming near me with a shot of any kind until January 21st.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:05.059]  And by then, we'll have the cures out to the people that the taxpayers paid for 50 years ago.
[02:42:05.299 --> 02:42:07.299]  Folks, we've got them all in the freezers.
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:09.739]  You need not do any more experimenting.
[02:42:09.739 --> 02:42:13.639]  All you need to do is don't let anybody shoot your children.
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:14.979]  Don't shoot yourself.
[02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:17.819]  Don't inject Ozempic or anything else.
[02:42:17.959 --> 02:42:21.360]  This is criminal, and it has to end.
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:25.899]  The only way to end is if we end it.
[02:42:26.829 --> 02:42:27.069]  I agree.
[02:42:27.090 --> 02:42:29.510]  Let me tell a story about my dad that I've told quite a few times.
[02:42:29.610 --> 02:42:30.629]  I've probably never told you this.
[02:42:31.549 --> 02:42:41.729]  He was like top of his class, won this statewide science fair thing and was giving speeches like when he was 14 and was on like, you know, WBAP Texas radio.
[02:42:41.729 --> 02:42:42.850]  I had a show on the weekend.
[02:42:43.350 --> 02:42:54.260]  And then his mom, who was a school principal, you know, entered this contest to be joined NASA and And Eisenhower's whiz kids, Eisenhower was already out of office, but it was right after that.
[02:42:54.399 --> 02:42:54.959]  Kennedy was in.
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:01.399]  And so they go, oh yeah, David Jones, we're going to put you in UT, plan two when you're 14 years old.
[02:43:02.459 --> 02:43:05.680]  And we're going to send you around and you're not going to go to school anymore.
[02:43:06.139 --> 02:43:09.959]  And then we're going to, you know, this is how you join NASA. You need to do this first.
[02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:13.280]  Well, his first thing when he's 15 is they send him to Houston.
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:19.000]  And then he lived with, you know, my grandfather's brother while he was in Houston for a year.
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:25.299]  And he was sent into MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility, put him in a white lab coat.
[02:43:25.819 --> 02:43:27.799]  And my dad told me the stories when he was a kid.
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:31.280]  And that's why later, by the time he was like 19, he got out of it.
[02:43:31.979 --> 02:43:34.200]  And he wouldn't even talk about the other projects they put him in.
[02:43:34.219 --> 02:43:35.379]  He said, I can't even get into it.
[02:43:35.479 --> 02:43:36.500]  He says, it was, you know, it was...
[02:43:37.059 --> 02:43:37.860]  Really bad stuff.
[02:43:38.579 --> 02:43:42.520]  And they get the best and brightest, and obviously Fauci was involved in all this, but he liked it.
[02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:48.899]  And my dad said the reason he asked me to transfer out of MD Anderson was people would sign the forms that were terminal cancer.
[02:43:49.079 --> 02:43:51.100]  He said it looked like something out of A Day of the Dead.
[02:43:51.559 --> 02:43:57.399]  Missing mandibles, all these experiments, people that had signed forms to help people, being tortured.
[02:43:57.639 --> 02:44:08.530]  And he said he would sit there with the scientists when he's 15 and And he said that they would be injecting people, and my dad said it was like the scientists were having orgasms, killing people.
[02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:13.209]  He was watching them kill people all day long, and he started figuring out these are psychotics.
[02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:15.430]  And so he said, I want to be transferred to something else.
[02:44:15.489 --> 02:44:16.829]  They said, okay, we'll transfer you to this.
[02:44:16.909 --> 02:44:17.729]  And then he said...
[02:44:18.149 --> 02:44:23.149]  I can't really tell you what that was, but it was secret nuclear reactors under UT. And then it was other stuff.
[02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:26.750]  Then by the time he met my mom and stuff, he said, I'm not going to be a mainline doctor anymore.
[02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:29.010]  I'm just going to get a dental degree, and I'm out of this.
[02:44:29.069 --> 02:44:30.290]  And he left.
[02:44:30.629 --> 02:44:35.069]  But my point is, how many scientists, how many top kids were recruited?
[02:44:35.209 --> 02:44:36.290]  And we know the globalists do this.
[02:44:36.409 --> 02:44:37.110]  It's been in the news.
[02:44:37.409 --> 02:44:40.389]  And how long did it take you to wake up when you were...
[02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:41.729]  What was your recruitment like?
[02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:44.850]  Because we now know this is how they find the mad scientists.
[02:44:47.350 --> 02:44:49.430]  Well, I'm not that mad, but anyway.
[02:44:49.709 --> 02:44:51.069]  I'm not saying you're a mad scientist.
[02:44:51.229 --> 02:44:57.649]  I'm saying, I remember my dad as a kid telling me about this, and then I was like, you know, and then now it's all come out.
[02:44:58.569 --> 02:45:04.969]  Well, fortunately, I work with the honest scientists, Frank Rossetti, Candace Peart, Luke Montagnier, Bruce Lipton.
[02:45:05.409 --> 02:45:20.649]  Fortunately, in 1982, when I was told to manufacture the deadliest and the only known true human retrovirus in an open-air centrifuge at Fort Detrick to spread it around pregnant women,
[02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:24.510]  and I was 23, you know, I refused to do it.
[02:45:24.569 --> 02:45:25.649]  I lost my job.
[02:45:26.110 --> 02:45:28.190]  So that's what they do, though, is they fail.
[02:45:28.219 --> 02:45:30.340]  Finally get you in a position to see if you'll do it.
[02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:37.260]  Just like Fauci, you know, remove the larynx of beagles, put them in a bag, let flesh-eating worms eat them.
[02:45:37.379 --> 02:45:39.700]  It's all a test to see if the lab workers will do it, right?
[02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:47.709]  Well, and more importantly, they're experimenting on lab workers because they want to see, remember, remember, pandemic indoctrination?
[02:45:47.930 --> 02:45:49.629]  No, no, that's what my dad said he figured out.
[02:45:49.690 --> 02:45:51.610]  He goes, I figured out we were the experiments.
[02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:54.690]  I've talked to Delta Force, Navy SEALs, the same thing.
[02:45:54.889 --> 02:46:01.229]  They always say by the time they got deep into it, they realized the system hated them and was using them and that they were the experiments.
[02:46:02.459 --> 02:46:06.319]  And they're experimenting on your Columbia University and your Dartmouth.
[02:46:06.559 --> 02:46:14.940]  You want me to pull all your best and your brightest kids at these universities that they said biosafety level two, which is a basic lab bench.
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:22.379]  And they gave them AIDS and they injected COVID and they see if they get neuroimmune disease and go crazy called Lyme disease.
[02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:24.559]  So you think you're working on lab rats.
[02:46:24.799 --> 02:46:25.760]  You think you're working.
[02:46:25.879 --> 02:46:27.020]  I mean, really, they're working on you.
[02:46:27.959 --> 02:46:30.399]  Yeah, I never worked on rats.
[02:46:30.399 --> 02:46:34.559]  I only looked at the human, and thank God we were in the biosafety level three.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:36.180]  Thank God, Frank Resetti.
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:37.520]  Well, let's go back.
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:38.000]  Hold on.
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:38.799]  Let's tell the story.
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.520]  Let's go back to you at Fort Detrick, 23 years old, what you figured out was happening.
[02:46:43.909 --> 02:46:44.989]  Well, we figured out.
[02:46:45.430 --> 02:46:45.930]  People don't know.
[02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:47.690]  That's the premier bioweapon lab.
[02:46:47.809 --> 02:46:48.629]  She worked her own record.
[02:46:48.850 --> 02:46:51.149]  So imagine she's 23 and like, what the hell?
[02:46:51.209 --> 02:46:51.909]  We're the lab rats.
[02:46:52.530 --> 02:46:53.829]  We'll be right back.
[02:46:53.969 --> 02:47:01.370]  I mean, and now Bill Gates, the FDA head, all these folks will come out and said, oh, we don't know what these shots do.
[02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:03.010]  We're just testing it to see.
[02:47:04.049 --> 02:47:06.030]  I mean, this is wild.
[02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:07.110]  We'll be right back.
[02:47:07.469 --> 02:47:13.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:47:13.209 --> 02:47:14.510]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:47:14.690 --> 02:47:16.389]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:19.430]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:21.229]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:23.680]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:47:23.819 --> 02:47:26.159]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:47:26.299 --> 02:47:32.020]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:37.459]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:47:38.049 --> 02:47:46.149]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:47:46.149 --> 02:47:49.530]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:47:49.729 --> 02:47:57.729]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:47:57.989 --> 02:48:01.170]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[02:48:01.409 --> 02:48:02.690]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[02:48:02.909 --> 02:48:03.670]  Go check it out.
[02:48:03.930 --> 02:48:05.790]  That's their discounted up to $15.
[02:48:05.829 --> 02:48:10.569]  55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:48:10.770 --> 02:48:11.309]  Try it.
[02:48:11.350 --> 02:48:11.969]  You're going to love it.
[02:48:12.049 --> 02:48:12.489]  I'm on it.
[02:48:12.569 --> 02:48:13.350]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:14.329]  It's insane.
[02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:15.469]  Get that and other supplements.
[02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:20.129]  And then there's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:26.649]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top Hot producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:27.590]  They have the best designs.
[02:48:28.010 --> 02:48:29.709]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:48:29.729 --> 02:48:32.190]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:33.850]  These designs are incredible.
[02:48:34.030 --> 02:48:40.270]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:48:40.450 --> 02:48:41.010]  Here they are.
[02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:41.959]  Look at this one.
[02:48:42.139 --> 02:48:46.040]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:48:46.299 --> 02:48:48.059]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:48:48.239 --> 02:48:49.260]  You've got to get that.
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.559]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:48:51.899 --> 02:48:52.500]  Oh my goodness.
[02:48:52.899 --> 02:48:56.100]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:48:56.579 --> 02:48:59.479]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:48:59.959 --> 02:49:01.100]  Team Humanity.
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:02.799]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:05.139]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:49:05.319 --> 02:49:07.059]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:49:07.540 --> 02:49:12.719]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:14.040]  Darkest Hour.
[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:15.479]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:49:15.739 --> 02:49:20.600]  And so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:49:20.719 --> 02:49:22.799]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:49:23.319 --> 02:49:28.139]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:49:28.299 --> 02:49:40.760]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:49:40.819 --> 02:49:44.559]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:49:45.059 --> 02:49:48.479]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:50.920]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:49:51.079 --> 02:49:52.340]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:53.659]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:56.860]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:57.840]  And they spread the word.
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:49:58.600]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:05.000]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:08.239]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:19.229]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:50:19.389 --> 02:50:21.850]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:50:21.989 --> 02:50:32.149]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:50:32.290 --> 02:50:34.149]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[02:50:34.370 --> 02:50:35.590]  You're going to want to order again.
[02:50:35.629 --> 02:50:38.030]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:50:38.409 --> 02:50:39.450]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:40.409]  We're going after them.
[02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:46.530]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:50:46.850 --> 02:50:47.989]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:51.750]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:50:51.889 --> 02:51:01.350]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:51:02.709 --> 02:51:05.329]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:16.829]  Dr. Judy Mikevitz, top scientist on air right now, warning these so-called vaccines are mutinogenic cancer virus cocktails designed to murder you.
[02:51:18.219 --> 02:51:24.200]  Doctor, you got cut off by the break there, and we were getting into all of this news breaking.
[02:51:24.899 --> 02:51:27.040]  35,000 foot view from you.
[02:51:27.860 --> 02:51:29.479]  How is it going for the globalists?
[02:51:29.559 --> 02:51:31.680]  It looks like they're getting their ass handed to them everywhere.
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:32.879]  There's a mass awakening.
[02:51:35.319 --> 02:51:37.000]  How would you describe where we are right now?
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:42.700]  Well, we're in a fabulous place right now because all we have to do is recognize one thing.
[02:51:42.899 --> 02:51:46.360]  Not one more needle goes in one more arm.
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:56.239]  Nothing that was called a vaccine ever satisfied the 1986 Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Act.
[02:51:56.399 --> 02:51:58.920]  They're all causing exactly those injuries.
[02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:02.860]  Nothing called a vaccine was ever an immunization.
[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:08.629]  That act That federal act alone showed the depth and the breadth of the injury.
[02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:13.149]  And the game with COVID-19 was kill as many people as possible.
[02:52:13.329 --> 02:52:14.549]  Call it something else.
[02:52:14.829 --> 02:52:20.110]  Again, never should a kid who was already vaccine injured call it autism.
[02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:21.510]  It doesn't matter what they call it.
[02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:22.510]  It's vaccine injury.
[02:52:22.729 --> 02:52:24.329]  It's the mTOR pathway.
[02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:28.870]  Rapamycin could have been used to cure that kid along with ivermectin a long time ago.
[02:52:29.219 --> 02:52:36.940]  I think?
[02:52:46.850 --> 02:52:47.690]  It was beautiful.
[02:52:47.909 --> 02:52:56.129]  It showed at every level of the globalists how they lost control in December of 2019. That the jig was up.
[02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:57.209]  That everything...
[02:52:57.209 --> 02:52:58.870]  It was over.
[02:52:59.049 --> 02:53:00.290]  That everybody knew.
[02:53:00.450 --> 02:53:01.149]  And by the way, you're right.
[02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.969]  Let me back you up.
[02:53:02.129 --> 02:53:03.829]  In November of...
[02:53:05.029 --> 02:53:16.149]  2019, they had an emergency hearing of the WHO vaccine program with their director and the top, I forget her name, a lady got up, the head of it, and she said, all our doctors are turning against us, 90 plus percent no.
[02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:18.069]  We don't even know what we're injecting people.
[02:53:18.209 --> 02:53:20.930]  We're giving it by these big pharma companies to test it on the public.
[02:53:21.170 --> 02:53:22.709]  It's all crimes against humanity.
[02:53:22.850 --> 02:53:23.389]  It's illegal.
[02:53:23.629 --> 02:53:29.649]  And then right then, Fauci and them rolled out their cover story to try to use a bigger story to cover up what they've done.
[02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:32.829]  And now you have Bill Gates admitting they're using India as guinea pigs and us too.
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:37.200]  You have the FDA board admitting, oh, we've been using this as guinea pigs.
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:39.879]  You have Bill Gates coming out.
[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:41.479]  So they're trying to hide it in plain view.
[02:53:41.680 --> 02:53:44.520]  Here's a clip of the latest thing a few days ago of Bill Gates.
[02:53:44.659 --> 02:53:46.299]  I want Dr. Judy Mikevitz's take on this.
[02:53:47.209 --> 02:53:58.309]  Well, when India's an example of a country where, oh, there's plenty of things that are difficult there, the health, nutrition, education is improving.
[02:53:58.309 --> 02:54:10.500]  And they're stable enough and generating their own government revenue enough that It's very likely that 20 years from now, people will be dramatically better off.
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:17.239]  And it's kind of a laboratory to try things that then, once you prove them out in India, you can take to other places.
[02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:29.920]  And so our biggest non-U.S. office for the foundation is in India, and the most number of pilot rollout things we're doing anywhere in the world are with partners in India.
[02:54:29.959 --> 02:54:35.079]  In India, you know, if you go there and you've never been, you might think, whoa, this is a chaotic place.
[02:54:35.819 --> 02:54:42.479]  And, you know, you're not used to so many levels of income all being on the street at the same time.
[02:54:42.479 --> 02:54:45.000]  But you will get a sense of the vibrancy.
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.479]  So he's saying we test things out on them.
[02:54:49.700 --> 02:54:52.219]  Total violation of informed consent in Ermberg Code.
[02:54:52.819 --> 02:54:53.819]  Dr. Mikevitz.
[02:54:56.030 --> 02:55:17.920]  Yes, and what he said in Plandemic Indoctrination when they showed the Indian government and the Somalians who they experimented on with the deadly Gardasil vaccine and experimented on those young girls and gave them everything we see with the neuropathies and And the injuries that we see with,
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:23.739]  for instance, Maddie DeGarry, you know, that was their last, that was the last one we had to get.
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:33.459]  We already got the boys, and all we have to do is find something that can transmit right through the frontal lobe, and we did that.
[02:55:33.559 --> 02:55:38.260]  And Bobby Kennedy did that, those Gardasil cases that are pure for all.
[02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:39.040]  All right, back in 60 seconds.
[02:55:39.059 --> 02:55:39.540]  Please continue.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:53.049]  All right, the globalists have announced that they're going to try to create a civil war When Trump tries to go after the illegal aliens and try to overthrow them that way, they've also said they're accelerating World War III. They've said they've got new viruses that are going to stop him.
[02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.870]  They've openly said that.
[02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:55.069]  I already played the clip last hour.
[02:55:55.229 --> 02:55:56.229]  They're so arrogant.
[02:55:56.690 --> 02:56:01.829]  Or is it a defense mechanism to act arrogant and overly confident because they know they're in so much trouble?
[02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:02.989]  I see that everywhere.
[02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:04.450]  In fact, that's not my opinion.
[02:56:04.450 --> 02:56:05.049]  That's a fact.
[02:56:07.210 --> 02:56:09.209]  So this is quite a moment to be alive.
[02:56:09.270 --> 02:56:11.969]  They're also trying to pull the rug out for the economy.
[02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:14.510]  We've got an economist coming on in a little while to break that down.
[02:56:14.610 --> 02:56:15.250]  That's very important.
[02:56:15.350 --> 02:56:18.350]  But Dr. Minkiewicz, I've gone a lot of angles.
[02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:19.930]  You're so gracious to come on with us.
[02:56:20.350 --> 02:56:22.010]  We've got about seven, eight minutes left.
[02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:23.090]  I want to try to shut up now.
[02:56:23.209 --> 02:56:23.909]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[02:56:24.209 --> 02:56:25.270]  Talk about your books.
[02:56:25.370 --> 02:56:28.409]  Talk about what people really do get themselves healthy because you're dead on.
[02:56:28.549 --> 02:56:32.569]  I've seen all the evidence and just any other key points you want to impart to folks.
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:38.959]  Well, I think the most important thing is vaccination is not immunization.
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:41.739]  It's extermination and sterilization.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:57:04.530]  And so oral immunization strategies, including every drug that we developed and know how to use We've used it better since 2008. This is the Bernadine Healy talk in 2008 that we currently have in our newsletter because she said if we could protect certain populations who have already been injured,
[02:57:04.690 --> 02:57:05.889]  that's why my upset.
[02:57:06.110 --> 02:57:08.850]  These autistic kids, they weren't born that way.
[02:57:08.969 --> 02:57:10.069]  They're vaccine injured.
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:17.760]  And we knew how to heal them then, and we've done so much better over the last 20 years of doing exactly that.
[02:57:17.959 --> 02:57:20.459]  We can quickly hit these pathways.
[02:57:20.879 --> 02:57:24.739]  It's pathways of pathogenesis, disease causation.
[02:57:24.879 --> 02:57:27.959]  It's not this virus or that virus.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:33.860]  It's our God-given immune system that will protect us, and all we need to do is neutrify.
[02:57:34.059 --> 02:57:38.200]  Cancer and AIDS are acquired immune deficiencies.
[02:57:38.549 --> 02:57:54.750]  We're good to go.
[02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:57.670]  We have cannabinoids in the soil.
[02:57:57.790 --> 02:57:59.149]  We can restore our soil.
[02:57:59.270 --> 02:58:01.469]  We can do all of that right now.
[02:58:01.569 --> 02:58:02.149]  We can clean.
[02:58:02.270 --> 02:58:03.690]  We have the technologies.
[02:58:03.790 --> 02:58:12.950]  We can bring out the med beds and the energy technologies and take that along with the nutritionals, with the rapamycin, ivermectin.
[02:58:13.159 --> 02:58:19.719]  Everything we've known to cure all of these cancers and AIDS, curative strategies and prevention.
[02:58:19.979 --> 02:58:22.559]  And this is where our patents lie.
[02:58:22.879 --> 02:58:25.979]  And we've still got them in prostate cancer.
[02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:32.959]  And all we have to do is satisfy the true law, the 2004 Botanical Drug Guidance Act.
[02:58:33.239 --> 02:58:35.100]  FDA has no authority.
[02:58:35.219 --> 02:58:37.239]  We don't have to repurpose drugs.
[02:58:37.530 --> 02:58:54.209]  And I know we can get that done where just the safety of our food, the safety, long-term safety studies, if it's generally regarded as safe and satisfies the Botanical Drug Guidance Act, where the function is what is seen from the nutrients,
[02:58:54.250 --> 02:59:06.370]  and we take advantage of those synergies, then we can take drugs like rapamycin and in one thing at the various low dose, maybe once a week, keep people balanced, keep their immune system.
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:10.700]  Absolutely heal all of this.
[02:59:11.059 --> 02:59:15.100]  But the most important thing is not another shot.
[02:59:15.280 --> 02:59:16.819]  No more vaccinations.
[02:59:17.159 --> 02:59:21.479]  Our laws require immunization at every state capitol.
[02:59:21.819 --> 02:59:29.959]  Do not allow the laws to be changed where vaccination and immunization are used interchangeably.
[02:59:30.149 --> 02:59:31.870]  That's where there's a problem.
[02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:36.809]  It's very important that immunity is lifelong.
[02:59:37.450 --> 02:59:43.729]  My grandmother had diphtheria as a child in the early 1900s.
[02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:47.989]  I have immunity, an antibody, to diphtheria.
[02:59:48.129 --> 02:59:56.329]  If you survived the 1917 pandemic strain of influenza, You do have immunity.
[02:59:56.590 --> 03:00:04.629]  These kids who are injected with SARS-CoV-2 in every polio vaccine, they're not asymptomatic carriers of disease.
[03:00:04.629 --> 03:00:09.569]  You don't inject the whooping cough, the pertussis.
[03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:18.829]  You don't inject it and stop the immune system from detoxifying, from coughing, and then spread it around.
[03:00:19.090 --> 03:00:21.750]  You don't mandate that.
[03:00:21.870 --> 03:00:25.149]  The sovereignty of each person's immune system.
[03:00:25.329 --> 03:00:26.870]  You don't mandate anyone.
[03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:28.670]  Everyone has a choice.
[03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:35.129]  And so the quicker they can load up everybody, the next shot could kill these kids.
[03:00:35.309 --> 03:00:42.069]  And so that's what's laudable about About using rapamycin, but this isn't a case report.
[03:00:42.329 --> 03:00:57.530]  And the other treatments were wrong and continue to be wrong because we aren't taking the 50 years of taxpayer-funded at every level of the intramural NIH program, the National Cancer Institute,
[03:00:57.989 --> 03:01:01.930]  Frank Rossetti, the work that belongs to the taxpayers.
[03:01:02.290 --> 03:01:05.530]  You know, and so it's...
[03:01:06.299 --> 03:01:07.840]  We don't care.
[03:01:08.079 --> 03:01:14.680]  The point is, as long as nobody ever injects, it's not a coronavirus.
[03:01:15.159 --> 03:01:21.959]  It's part HIV, part XMRV, and part SARS. It's right there in that 2004 paper.
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:23.920]  They have no new weapons.
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:26.260]  They've already injected them all.
[03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:29.930]  And look how good our immune system is.
[03:01:30.090 --> 03:01:31.770]  No more shots.
[03:01:31.950 --> 03:01:32.930]  Not Ozempic.
[03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.989]  Don't shoot yourself.
[03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:39.069]  I can't stop people from going into grocery stores and poisoning themselves.
[03:01:39.290 --> 03:01:45.450]  I can't get people to take off the deadly masks and put on a true 47 silver mask.
[03:01:45.569 --> 03:01:49.639]  They're There are solutions for this, as the McCullough paper shows.
[03:01:49.739 --> 03:01:51.760]  But we don't need a case report.
[03:01:51.959 --> 03:01:58.139]  We need to deploy the cures as fast as we deployed the bioweapons.
[03:01:58.299 --> 03:02:02.299]  And the cures are there and the taxpayers already paid for them.
[03:02:02.399 --> 03:02:04.239]  And we need to put that back.
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:12.040]  We need to restore our land, heal our land, and then we'll have a health like we've never seen before.
[03:02:14.479 --> 03:02:19.360]  Dr. Judy Mikevitz, please tell people about your great website, your great work, and also your amazing books.
[03:02:20.149 --> 03:02:40.469]  Well, our last book, Ending Plague, A Scholar's Obligation in an Age of Corruption, literally details everything that was done in Fort Detrick from Frank Rossetti, who, of course, discovered these viruses and knew the bioweapons program of Gallo and Fauci.
[03:02:40.969 --> 03:02:53.659]  Again, that details the crimes committed back to 1975. He and Luke Montagnier never talked About what truly happened in HIV-AIDS until this book.
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:57.200]  They both lost basically their lives.
[03:02:57.399 --> 03:03:03.299]  Luc Montagnier was murdered February 8th of 2022, but he knew it had to be said.
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:05.260]  And so these are heroes.
[03:03:05.459 --> 03:03:19.940]  That last book is the key because as we know from, I played in our book club, On TheRealDrJudy.com, Dr. Scott Atlas' beautiful book, A Plague Upon Our House Last Night.
[03:03:20.139 --> 03:03:22.979]  The truth is the truth and facts are facts.
[03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:29.360]  And when you see the data and you don't cover up and you realize every one of us played a role at some level.
[03:03:29.549 --> 03:03:33.569]  And allowing this plague of corruption to continue.
[03:03:33.829 --> 03:03:42.629]  But now we, the people, have spoken and we need to make sure that Trump and Kennedy have all of us behind them.
[03:03:42.729 --> 03:03:46.469]  And to do that, we need to walk away from the fear porn.
[03:03:46.629 --> 03:03:47.309]  No more shots.
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:50.940]  Don't go anywhere near a grocery store with a pharmacy in it.
[03:03:51.399 --> 03:03:53.520]  Vaccination is not immunization.
[03:03:53.739 --> 03:04:00.879]  Don't go in CVS. Don't go anywhere near the Leidos machine in the airport where they detonate the bioweapons.
[03:04:00.879 --> 03:04:02.500]  Ask yourself, who is Leidos?
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:11.280]  Why were they my employer, the contractor at the Cancer Research Center where I led the lab of antiviral drug mechanisms in 2001?
[03:04:12.899 --> 03:04:19.760]  Where every bit of that intellectual property was two small companies, Epigenetics Pharmaceuticals and Genius Omnatura.
[03:04:19.979 --> 03:04:21.340]  We have the diagnostics.
[03:04:21.459 --> 03:04:22.319]  We have the cures.
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:29.239]  It doesn't matter what bioweapon, as long as you never inject anything again, we can heal you.
[03:04:29.879 --> 03:04:30.319]  Absolutely.
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:32.700]  Dr. Mikovits, thank you so much.
[03:04:32.780 --> 03:04:33.260]  We love you.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:34.200]  We appreciate you.
[03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:36.319]  Again, what's the best website for people to find you?
[03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:41.719]  Therealdrjudy.com and on X, Dr. Judy A. Mikevitz.
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:43.000]  It's all right there.
[03:04:43.299 --> 03:04:45.059]  Everything is free.
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:45.659]  Go.
[03:04:46.079 --> 03:04:46.639]  Learn.
[03:04:46.959 --> 03:04:53.280]  It's beautiful to realize you really, the power to heal is yours, as my friend Robert Scott Bell says.
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:56.200]  All right, doctor.
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:56.959]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:57.059 --> 03:04:58.100]  Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[03:04:58.340 --> 03:04:58.680]  All right.
[03:04:58.879 --> 03:05:00.780]  Now, I want to get into the economy attack.
[03:05:01.159 --> 03:05:02.319]  This is really important.
[03:05:02.459 --> 03:05:06.120]  We haven't focused on this enough, and we're going to go into it here in just a moment.
[03:05:06.239 --> 03:05:08.500]  But speaking of the economy, this is an info war.
[03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:10.020]  You want somebody to fight the new world order?
[03:05:10.139 --> 03:05:12.260]  You want somebody to take on the globalists and win?
[03:05:12.299 --> 03:05:13.139]  We're doing it.
[03:05:13.219 --> 03:05:14.120]  We're fighting for you.
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:15.579]  We're fighting for our own futures together.
[03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:17.829]  This is a team effort.
[03:05:18.069 --> 03:05:23.409]  We have incredible products at thealexjonesstore.com and our other great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.

[03:05:50.030 --> 03:05:50.850]  I think Monday it ends.
[03:05:51.649 --> 03:05:52.370]  drjonesnatorials.com.
[03:05:52.489 --> 03:05:53.489]  A lot of stuff's about to sell out.
[03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:56.069]  And then, of course, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:05:56.149 --> 03:05:57.430]  We'll come back on The Economy straight ahead.
[03:05:59.170 --> 03:06:02.129]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[03:06:02.959 --> 03:06:05.319]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[03:06:06.219 --> 03:06:08.799]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[03:06:09.139 --> 03:06:12.360]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:15.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:17.399]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[03:06:17.819 --> 03:06:23.860]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[03:06:24.100 --> 03:06:27.159]  We're going to take control January 20th and people are going to be held accountable.
[03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:28.579]  We're going to be very transparent.
[03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:29.700]  We're going to get behind.
[03:06:30.049 --> 03:06:33.110]  What did the United Nations have to do with this open border crisis?
[03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:34.870]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[03:06:35.049 --> 03:06:39.129]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[03:06:39.270 --> 03:06:40.590]  Again, by design.
[03:06:40.770 --> 03:06:42.270]  And so much more is happening.
[03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:43.309]  This is an exciting time.
[03:06:43.549 --> 03:06:45.510]  But the globalists are striking back.
[03:06:45.629 --> 03:06:48.170]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air.
[03:06:48.510 --> 03:06:51.569]  Now, more than ever, and we can't do it without you.
[03:06:51.629 --> 03:06:52.549]  So we make it easy.
[03:06:52.729 --> 03:06:58.870]  Go to thealexshownstore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of Patriot apparel anywhere.
[03:06:59.049 --> 03:07:02.620]  To spread the word, to meet like-minded people, And support the Infoward.
[03:07:02.739 --> 03:07:12.100]  Now, the folks at Bigly that power the AlexJoeStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[03:07:12.159 --> 03:07:13.719]  And I personally love this one.
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:17.420]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:19.879]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[03:07:19.879 --> 03:07:21.200]  It's a great conversation piece.
[03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:23.159]  And this will horrify.
[03:07:23.619 --> 03:07:28.760]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking in fear, walking on the street, saying it's okay.
[03:07:29.219 --> 03:07:33.860]  Alex Jones doesn't fight, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:40.479]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[03:07:40.700 --> 03:07:43.959]  And then of course there's the Darth Sidious of hoodies.
[03:07:44.559 --> 03:07:46.299]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:53.389]  While you're there, believe me, If you love our information, you're going to love the supplements like Ultimate Sea Moss.
[03:07:53.530 --> 03:07:55.229]  That is the ultimate superfood.
[03:07:55.450 --> 03:07:57.670]  It's the strongest, one of the strongest out there.

[03:09:40.649 --> 03:09:43.010]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[03:09:43.170 --> 03:09:45.489]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with a fight.
[03:09:45.729 --> 03:09:46.750]  God bless and good luck.
[03:09:47.209 --> 03:09:48.370]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[03:09:49.370 --> 03:09:51.270]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[03:09:51.450 --> 03:09:54.329]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[03:09:54.690 --> 03:09:58.030]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[03:09:59.469 --> 03:10:16.260]  Alright, I wanted to get Dr. Kirk Elliott a very successful, with an incredible track record of accurate predicting what's going to happen on today, because he always wants to get into bricks, but everybody knows about bricks, and we're like, okay, but there have been big bricks developments in the last few days with Trump's saying he'll destroy BRICS,
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:18.340]  as Kirk predicted.
[03:10:18.420 --> 03:10:20.000]  He said, listen, it's going to be America first.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:21.299]  It's going to hurt these other countries.
[03:10:21.799 --> 03:10:25.520]  Putin's saying, well, that'll just accelerate BRICS. I don't know if that's the case.
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:30.340]  Also, why the government intervention in the housing market is fueling a disaster.
[03:10:31.020 --> 03:10:31.739]  Zero hedge.
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:35.479]  There are folks who are very smart say they're trying to pull the rug out from the Trump economy right now.
[03:10:35.659 --> 03:10:37.780]  There's a lot of angles in the next...
[03:10:38.290 --> 03:10:40.270]  39 minutes we have left.
[03:10:40.450 --> 03:10:47.829]  And Kirk Elliott has the top silver and gold brokerage company in the United States because they've got the best prices and are the place to go.
[03:10:48.649 --> 03:10:50.569]  The smart moves get into gold and silver.
[03:10:51.809 --> 03:10:56.469]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[03:10:56.930 --> 03:10:58.629]  And I'm going to hand the baton.
[03:10:58.790 --> 03:11:06.860]  He sent a lot of material, a lot of documents to talk about The other big track, the globalist attack on our economy to undermine Trump.
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:08.379]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, Merry Christmas.
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:09.819]  You're in command now.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.280]  And then, at 3 p.m.
[03:11:11.379 --> 03:11:13.120]  Central, Owen Schroyer takes over.
[03:11:14.629 --> 03:11:15.190]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:15.370 --> 03:11:16.430]  Merry Christmas to you, too.
[03:11:16.590 --> 03:11:18.030]  And it's great to be here.
[03:11:18.409 --> 03:11:23.629]  And I know we've talked a lot about BRICS on this show over the last year.
[03:11:24.430 --> 03:11:26.850]  So I don't want to go over a bunch of that old stuff.
[03:11:26.989 --> 03:11:31.729]  However, there was some big news over the weekend, literally huge.
[03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:44.170]  So what happened when Trump talked to Xi this weekend and said, hey, China, we're gonna slap 100% tariffs on you.
[03:11:44.409 --> 03:11:45.950]  On Chinese goods.
[03:11:46.450 --> 03:11:47.909]  What does that mean?
[03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:52.389]  It means that anything coming from China is going to be double the price.
[03:11:52.690 --> 03:11:54.770]  So that's a big deal.
[03:11:55.049 --> 03:11:57.270]  Or is it?
[03:11:57.409 --> 03:11:59.329]  Because when you look at...
[03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:09.399]  What he has done, what he's going to do, and the leadership that we have with Trump to actually make all of these happen.
[03:12:09.659 --> 03:12:17.079]  Because you've got to have a strong leader that's in place when you start stealing money from other countries' wallets, right?
[03:12:17.420 --> 03:12:23.719]  So that's what he's going to do because we're still a massive consumption engine to the world.
[03:12:24.549 --> 03:12:25.069]  Massive.
[03:12:25.250 --> 03:12:31.110]  So when we put 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, well, they're not gonna sell as much.
[03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:40.989]  But yet, the BRICS nations, when you look at a map of the BRICS and how the growth of BRICS has been so significant, they've been around for a while.
[03:12:41.110 --> 03:12:43.329]  They've been around for, I don't know, 15 plus years.
[03:12:43.549 --> 03:12:46.989]  And it started out with Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa.
[03:12:47.469 --> 03:13:01.909]  And then last, so from 2010 to 2024, They added some other big significant countries, most of them last year, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt and Iran and Ethiopia.
[03:13:02.430 --> 03:13:09.489]  And then in October 24th of this year, there's 13 more countries that they added.
[03:13:09.649 --> 03:13:11.510]  So you add all of that up.
[03:13:11.629 --> 03:13:12.909]  Well, I shouldn't say added.
[03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:14.950]  They are going to be members.
[03:13:15.090 --> 03:13:16.989]  They basically said, hey, we're going to be membership.
[03:13:16.989 --> 03:13:23.780]  So they're waiting until the next meeting and But when you add all that together, it's literally about 70% of the world's population.
[03:13:24.340 --> 03:13:31.079]  So when Trump puts tariffs on Chinese goods, they still have 70% of the world.
[03:13:31.219 --> 03:13:33.420]  Granted, it's not the consumption engine of America.
[03:13:33.559 --> 03:13:36.399]  So how are they gonna fight back, right?
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:38.940]  No doubt in my mind, Trump is gonna win.
[03:13:39.260 --> 03:13:40.659]  No doubt in my mind.
[03:13:41.149 --> 03:13:43.049]  Because he's got a plan, right?
[03:13:43.250 --> 03:13:49.809]  And just like he did with Mexico when he went to the president of Mexico and he told her, like, hey, you know what?
[03:13:49.889 --> 03:13:56.209]  We're gonna put tariffs on Mexican goods unless you help us get these illegals back across the border.
[03:13:57.260 --> 03:14:04.819]  I had a conversation with Justin Trudeau, which actually is just hilarious Trump style.
[03:14:04.959 --> 03:14:06.559]  It's like, well, you know what?
[03:14:06.680 --> 03:14:08.600]  We're gonna put things on you guys.
[03:14:08.739 --> 03:14:12.540]  You might as well be the 51st state, and you can be the governor of it, right?
[03:14:12.639 --> 03:14:14.659]  You're so insignificant kind of a message.
[03:14:14.879 --> 03:14:16.479]  So Trump is amazing.
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:19.620]  Tariffs work, which is why the founding fathers...
[03:14:20.399 --> 03:14:27.260]  Had them as our mechanism for income for this country for the first 100 plus years, right?
[03:14:27.319 --> 03:14:31.100]  It wasn't till early 1900s when income tax was even a thing.
[03:14:31.260 --> 03:14:34.319]  So you have that map that was just on the screen, right?
[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:36.159]  It's like that is a lot of the world.
[03:14:36.319 --> 03:14:38.540]  So what could China do back?
[03:14:39.209 --> 03:14:42.069]  What could they do to actually fight these things?
[03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:48.989]  Well, I think that there's a few options, some of them not reality, in my opinion.
[03:14:49.370 --> 03:14:53.290]  Because number one, they could say, okay, America, you're slapping tariffs on us.
[03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:55.889]  We're gonna put tariffs on your goods coming in.
[03:14:56.030 --> 03:15:00.690]  It's like, okay, how many exports do we actually have going into China?
[03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:02.290]  Hardly any, right?
[03:15:02.430 --> 03:15:05.549]  So I don't think that's going to be a legitimate thing.
[03:15:06.010 --> 03:15:12.030]  What about They could dump U.S. Treasuries.
[03:15:12.149 --> 03:15:14.430]  I think this is probably what they're going to do.
[03:15:14.549 --> 03:15:18.930]  Because they still have a trillion dollars worth of U.S. Treasuries that they own.
[03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:31.290]  And so their response to Trump's tariffs, right, to actually get them because they're showing their ugly ways and they want to be the world's reserve currency.
[03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:32.690]  This is why Trump did what he did.
[03:15:33.450 --> 03:15:36.069]  Is they could dump US Treasuries on the open market.
[03:15:36.069 --> 03:15:40.389]  When they do that, it basically is gonna crush the US dollar.
[03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:49.870]  And the normal policy mechanism to actually stop a devaluing currency, which is inflationary, is to raise interest rates.
[03:15:50.030 --> 03:15:52.209]  So you could devalue the dollar.
[03:15:53.620 --> 03:15:56.459]  This says, I think Trump's got this one figured out too.
[03:15:56.639 --> 03:16:00.819]  Because if you dump all those treasuries on the open market, the value will come down.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:02.479]  That's a weak dollar, right?
[03:16:02.860 --> 03:16:06.180]  Well, here's where it's gonna backfire on them.
[03:16:06.420 --> 03:16:14.280]  Because a weak dollar means that all of our exports to the rest of the world are gonna be cheaper.
[03:16:15.049 --> 03:16:15.350]  Right?
[03:16:15.549 --> 03:16:17.670]  So it's like, all right, it's gonna be cheaper for them.
[03:16:17.850 --> 03:16:24.610]  So a weak dollar actually helps all of our products go into the rest of the world where people will want to buy them.
[03:16:24.989 --> 03:16:38.549]  So the third thing that they could do, which is what they actually just started, what did Russia, or I'm sorry, what did China say that they're going to do just yesterday?
[03:16:39.340 --> 03:16:47.760]  Yesterday, they're banning the exports of critical minerals to the United States as trade tensions start to escalate, right?
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  So, man, this is a big deal because some of these rare earth minerals, they're needed for military applications and things like that.
[03:16:59.139 --> 03:17:00.899]  So China thinks that they've got us.
[03:17:01.459 --> 03:17:02.260]  No, they don't.
[03:17:02.559 --> 03:17:03.479]  They don't.
[03:17:03.899 --> 03:17:10.579]  Because when they start to do that, and we have tariffs, I mean, tariffs don't have to stop at 100%.
[03:17:11.469 --> 03:17:13.129]  Trump could say, okay, 150%.
[03:17:13.129 --> 03:17:15.889]  He could say 200% if he wants to, right?
[03:17:16.229 --> 03:17:19.409]  And so this plan is really gonna work.
[03:17:19.549 --> 03:17:23.190]  But in the meantime, we're gonna have a lot of tension.
[03:17:23.489 --> 03:17:24.870]  We're gonna have a lot of turbulence.
[03:17:25.090 --> 03:17:27.270]  We're gonna have a lot of geopolitical turmoil.
[03:17:27.569 --> 03:17:40.530]  And the reason Trump actually had to say, we're gonna slap 100% tariffs on you, It's because the BRICS nations want to be the world's reserve currency, like we've talked about numerous times.
[03:17:41.129 --> 03:17:51.750]  On October 24th, when they met, they said, we're gonna have our own BRICS currency, and it's gonna be 40% backed by gold, 60% weighted by the countries in the BRICS nations.
[03:17:52.309 --> 03:18:01.329]  And you put that on the tail end of last year's BRICS meeting, Putin started it off by saying, we're gonna de-dollarize the world, it's our objective, it's irreversible.
[03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:03.329]  So what does this all mean?
[03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:07.250]  It means Trump does not want them to be the world's reserve currency.
[03:18:07.270 --> 03:18:10.110]  And he said, you better stop, or we're gonna put tariffs on you.
[03:18:10.489 --> 03:18:13.290]  More to come after the break, cuz there's more to this story.
[03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:21.850]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[03:18:21.889 --> 03:18:22.989]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:18:23.329 --> 03:18:27.309]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there.
[03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:29.549]  Just being in this studio, I never imagined I'd be.
[03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:30.510]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:31.190]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:32.030]  I can't wait.
[03:18:32.579 --> 03:18:34.780]  To learn who the next winner is.
[03:18:34.940 --> 03:18:37.360]  And even though they shut out InfoWars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:43.739]  TheAlexJonesTore.com is not owned by me, so we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[03:18:43.879 --> 03:18:45.799]  We already knew that, but now they've bragged about it.
[03:18:45.959 --> 03:18:51.040]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on at the Alex Jones Network.
[03:18:51.219 --> 03:18:55.159]  And so, this baby is the new promotion, and I will be...
[03:18:55.549 --> 03:19:03.430]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alex Shows Network family.
[03:19:03.690 --> 03:19:05.069]  You are our family.
[03:19:05.290 --> 03:19:06.510]  God bless you all.
[03:19:06.649 --> 03:19:09.750]  Now go to thealkshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[03:19:09.889 --> 03:19:11.610]  Please stand by for further details.
[03:19:11.829 --> 03:19:13.950]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[03:19:14.129 --> 03:19:14.989]  Hey, we're back.
[03:19:15.270 --> 03:19:22.549]  And, you know, so this whole talk of China, the BRICS nations being the world's reserve currency, didn't just start.
[03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:28.770]  It didn't even start in the fall of last year when Putin said he was gonna de-dollarize the world.
[03:19:29.010 --> 03:19:42.010]  This started in reality back in January of 2023. So here's where the genesis of removing the petrodollar started.
[03:19:42.329 --> 03:20:03.190]  So China and Saudi Arabia, well, technically Aramco, Saudi's big, huge oil company, they signed an $83.7 billion yuan deal with two Chinese partners for construction of an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in Northeast China.
[03:20:03.430 --> 03:20:05.170]  So why does this matter?
[03:20:05.370 --> 03:20:13.010]  So I did some research here, and there's a couple things highlighted in this four or five paragraph memo.
[03:20:13.700 --> 03:20:14.680]  Well, here's why.
[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:17.120]  They actually said why they wanted to do this.
[03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:26.860]  It says, we want to be an all-inclusive source of energy and chemicals for China's long-term energy security and China's high-quality development.
[03:20:27.020 --> 03:20:35.680]  Okay, so this is why Aramco and China put together an 83 billion yuan deal to build refineries.
[03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:41.549]  And chemical plants in Northeast China, because China wants to be energy independent.
[03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:47.770]  It's like, good grief, America should have been trying to be energy independent over the last four years, right?
[03:20:48.030 --> 03:20:50.190]  So China's doing that.
[03:20:50.370 --> 03:20:52.409]  And so this was what?
[03:20:52.569 --> 03:20:54.969]  It was an 83 billion yuan deal.
[03:20:55.170 --> 03:20:55.690]  They didn't.
[03:20:55.829 --> 03:21:02.309]  This is gonna actually allow China to pay for oil in their own currency, not the US dollar.
[03:21:02.569 --> 03:21:04.510]  See, that's the elimination of the petrodollar.
[03:21:04.959 --> 03:21:12.260]  And then after that, not too long after that, Russia comes out with an announcement.
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:19.540]  Again, Russia, the R in the BRICS nations, says all exports leaving Russia, which is what?
[03:21:19.620 --> 03:21:21.899]  One of the second largest oil producer in the world.
[03:21:22.100 --> 03:21:23.899]  They have agricultural commodities.
[03:21:24.100 --> 03:21:25.180]  They have other raw materials.
[03:21:25.319 --> 03:21:26.879]  They're a big exporter of goods.
[03:21:27.100 --> 03:21:30.559]  Well, they're gonna do all of that with what's their payment method?
[03:21:30.680 --> 03:21:31.299]  The yuan.
[03:21:32.200 --> 03:21:33.600]  Not the US dollar.
[03:21:33.879 --> 03:21:43.559]  See, this violates the international agreements done back in 1944 under the Bretton Woods Act that made the US dollar the world's reserve currency.
[03:21:43.940 --> 03:21:55.399]  And you have a world's reserve currency, so all international settlements between countries can be done more systematically easily with kind of stability, right?
[03:21:55.719 --> 03:21:59.340]  Well, we've had that since 1944, so about 80 years.
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:08.420]  Well now, in one fell swoop, you've got China wanting to dismantle the petrodollar, Russia saying they're gonna trade in yuan instead of dollars.
[03:22:08.879 --> 03:22:12.079]  Wow, this whole world reserve currency thing is falling apart.
[03:22:12.319 --> 03:22:20.600]  So now that the BRICS have accelerated their growth over the last years, this is why Trump wanted to say, we're gonna do 100% tariffs.
[03:22:20.819 --> 03:22:21.559]  I mean, that's why.
[03:22:22.219 --> 03:22:29.959]  Because we need to, to regain our dominance that we've lost during the Biden years by exporting jobs and everything else.
[03:22:30.260 --> 03:22:34.860]  So to me, this tells me that a trade war is coming.
[03:22:35.020 --> 03:22:36.760]  A currency war is coming.
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:37.620]  It's already here.
[03:22:37.819 --> 03:22:44.319]  And generally following trade wars and currency wars comes an actual physical war, military conflict, right?
[03:22:44.950 --> 03:22:46.190]  This is what's on the horizon.
[03:22:46.489 --> 03:22:54.229]  This is what Trump is inheriting because of a void of leadership in the White House over the last four years.
[03:22:54.370 --> 03:22:56.129]  See, they're gonna blame it on him.
[03:22:56.409 --> 03:22:59.590]  We're already starting to see the blame game.
[03:23:00.139 --> 03:23:08.540]  So Trump's doing all these tariffs, and now look what's gonna happen to energy prices and all these different things, and the dollar is collapsing, and they're gonna blame it on Trump.
[03:23:09.059 --> 03:23:11.180]  He had nothing to do with it, right?
[03:23:11.219 --> 03:23:12.680]  He's trying to fix things.
[03:23:13.639 --> 03:23:17.639]  So economic growth is going to come under Trump.
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:18.520]  It's what he does.
[03:23:18.639 --> 03:23:23.319]  When you lower taxes, lower interest rates, create jobs people are gonna spend, the economy will grow.
[03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:27.520]  However, it's different than the last time.
[03:23:28.289 --> 03:23:32.209]  So Trump is inheriting a nightmare of an economy, right?
[03:23:32.290 --> 03:23:33.709]  It's different than his first four years.
[03:23:33.870 --> 03:23:44.969]  So this time, I was looking at this chart on Zero Hedge, the survival rate of US businesses, this chart is stunning, absolutely stunning, right?
[03:23:45.170 --> 03:23:55.120]  So if you look at 2017 as the baseline, Survival rates of U.S. companies are down on average 50 to 60%.
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:56.979]  Companies are failing.
[03:23:57.260 --> 03:24:03.700]  Well, of course, you've got all these agency rulings and you've got all these restrictions and all these things and higher taxes.
[03:24:03.979 --> 03:24:10.520]  And boy, wages have come down and unemployment's gone up under Biden's economy and companies just can't survive.
[03:24:11.309 --> 03:24:11.909]  They can't survive.
[03:24:12.129 --> 03:24:17.590]  And COVID really put the steroids on this acceleration downward spiral.
[03:24:17.850 --> 03:24:20.170]  And so what does Trump get?
[03:24:20.489 --> 03:24:24.290]  He gets a very low floor to start with this time.
[03:24:24.489 --> 03:24:30.409]  Means you have to recover so much just to get back to where we once were in his first four years.
[03:24:31.079 --> 03:24:35.540]  And this, I believe, is gonna be partly by design by the left.
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:38.620]  Let's destroy the economy as much as we can.
[03:24:38.819 --> 03:24:40.479]  We're gonna blame him, right?
[03:24:40.620 --> 03:24:46.159]  Whether it's new pandemics that are gonna be coming on January 21st, possibly, right?
[03:24:46.260 --> 03:24:48.579]  I mean, I'm just like, what could they possibly do?
[03:24:48.819 --> 03:24:51.620]  Well, how about have a major geopolitical crisis?
[03:24:51.860 --> 03:24:56.379]  What about the nuclear war that's being threatened between Russia and Ukraine and all this?
[03:24:56.860 --> 03:24:59.360]  All these things are gonna somehow be blamed on Trump.
[03:24:59.969 --> 03:25:06.829]  And the economic numbers that are coming out, they're fudging them again, right?
[03:25:06.969 --> 03:25:14.309]  As usual, the jobless numbers, all of a sudden this month looked great, when last month they were absolutely abysmal.
[03:25:14.889 --> 03:25:19.290]  They're trying to say, well, under Biden's economy, things were doing really great, and then look what Trump inherited.
[03:25:19.549 --> 03:25:26.190]  They're just revising the numbers every single month to make Trump look bad, but they're bad.
[03:25:27.069 --> 03:25:28.149]  They're bad to begin with.
[03:25:28.530 --> 03:25:43.750]  Just because they're revised, and they're fakely, falsely revised, they're doing that to make it look and appear good because people don't look at the truth and the reality when your news source is mainstream media,
[03:25:44.549 --> 03:25:45.110]  right?
[03:25:45.370 --> 03:25:51.129]  Trump's inheriting a cesspool of an economy, and he's got his work cut out for him.
[03:25:51.739 --> 03:25:53.299]  But I have all confidence in the world.
[03:25:53.299 --> 03:25:54.479]  He's gonna be able to get it done.
[03:25:54.579 --> 03:25:56.200]  Look at the cabinet members he's putting in.
[03:25:56.360 --> 03:26:00.680]  Look at the team of people who are going to get the job done.
[03:26:01.559 --> 03:26:03.180]  It's really incredible.
[03:26:03.739 --> 03:26:15.719]  When you think about what he's gonna do, when you look at Elon and Vivek, for example, in the DOGE program, well, what are they gonna do?
[03:26:16.799 --> 03:26:19.139]  There's a concept called impounding.
[03:26:19.379 --> 03:26:22.559]  And I think we're gonna hear a lot about that next year.
[03:26:22.739 --> 03:26:25.440]  So it's not like impounding your vehicle, right?
[03:26:25.540 --> 03:26:28.299]  It's when Congress passes a spending bill.
[03:26:29.100 --> 03:26:35.959]  And there's all this money left at the end of the year, and usually governments just spend it, whether they have to or not.
[03:26:36.139 --> 03:26:37.719]  Well, I think Trump is gonna impound it.
[03:26:37.780 --> 03:26:38.719]  He's gonna freeze those assets.
[03:26:39.260 --> 03:26:50.159]  So I think what we're gonna start to see is an automatic reduction in spending because the president has the ability to impound unused funds.
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:27:05.760]  I think this is a strategy that they're gonna use moving forward to start to lower the expenditures going out, along with getting rid of all kinds of wasted departments that shouldn't even be there, like the Department of Education and so forth, right?
[03:27:05.959 --> 03:27:09.340]  So the Democrats blew it on inflation.
[03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:13.520]  They made it worse, right?
[03:27:13.639 --> 03:27:26.329]  When you print money like there's no tomorrow to try to stimulate the economy, And that's gonna cause inflation, then you jack around with interest rates to try to fix it, and nothing is working.
[03:27:26.590 --> 03:27:33.030]  You can't raise interest rates like they're doing to slow down inflation when America is in debt up to its eyeballs.
[03:27:33.370 --> 03:27:35.790]  They ruined the economy.
[03:27:37.020 --> 03:27:41.520]  Trump's really good at building an economy, but this is gonna be a rough road, right?
[03:27:41.639 --> 03:27:47.420]  In this transition time, it's like, don't have these false expectations that he's gonna fix it overnight.
[03:27:47.959 --> 03:27:50.059]  As good as he is, he can't.
[03:27:50.260 --> 03:27:51.700]  There's too much debt.
[03:27:51.940 --> 03:27:53.819]  There's too many people not working.
[03:27:53.920 --> 03:27:58.680]  There's too many businesses that are not around that were four years ago.
[03:27:59.379 --> 03:27:59.620]  Right?
[03:27:59.799 --> 03:28:09.219]  And now you've got these geopolitical tensions in this competition from other countries like the BRICS nations to take away our petrodollar status, our reserve currency status.
[03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:12.579]  There is a turbulent time coming.
[03:28:12.799 --> 03:28:16.959]  The left is gonna do everything they can do to stop Trump from progress.
[03:28:17.940 --> 03:28:26.000]  But I, for one, am thankful that God answered prayers and Trump was elected, and he's gonna get it done.
[03:28:26.180 --> 03:28:27.520]  He is going to get it done.
[03:28:27.700 --> 03:28:32.840]  But here's where, how do markets respond to what he's gonna do?
[03:28:33.059 --> 03:28:38.100]  Well, the Fed, I want you all to watch this video.
[03:28:38.780 --> 03:28:46.399]  I mean, Jerome Powell, this might be one of the dumbest comments from a Fed chairman ever, like ever.
[03:28:46.879 --> 03:28:54.020]  So watch what he says about gold and Bitcoin and the US dollar in this 40-second video.
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:59.409]  I mean, and I'm gonna explain why this is so incredibly dumb, because It just is.
[03:28:59.489 --> 03:29:00.370]  You just got to watch it.
[03:29:00.489 --> 03:29:04.329]  So producers, if you're ready to share it, we can just watch that.
[03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:08.229]  And I'll stop yammering on here, and we'll talk about it as soon as it's over.
[03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:13.930]  Before I forget, one of the reasons I wanted to actually ask you about Bitcoin is, to some degree, people think that that is a...
[03:29:14.629 --> 03:29:22.510]  It's a symbol of people's faith or lack of faith in either the US dollar or in the Federal Reserve itself in terms of the system.
[03:29:22.829 --> 03:29:24.149]  What do you think of that idea?
[03:29:24.430 --> 03:29:26.090]  I don't think that's how people think about it.
[03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:30.430]  People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset.
[03:29:30.909 --> 03:29:31.850]  It's like gold.
[03:29:31.989 --> 03:29:33.049]  It's just like gold only.
[03:29:33.190 --> 03:29:33.670]  It's virtual.
[03:29:33.829 --> 03:29:34.309]  It's digital.
[03:29:34.920 --> 03:29:39.159]  People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value.
[03:29:39.340 --> 03:29:40.139]  It's highly volatile.
[03:29:40.379 --> 03:29:42.100]  It's not a competitor for the dollar.
[03:29:42.239 --> 03:29:43.379]  It's really a competitor for gold.
[03:29:45.120 --> 03:29:46.600]  That's really how I think of it.
[03:29:48.600 --> 03:29:49.079]  Okay.
[03:29:49.780 --> 03:29:59.399]  To say that Bitcoin and gold are not replacements for the dollar, they're not competitors of the dollar, are you joking me, Jerome Powell?
[03:29:59.659 --> 03:29:59.860]  Really?
[03:30:00.489 --> 03:30:10.750]  I mean, people go into Bitcoin and gold because of, you know, even though they're different, one's digital, one's tangible, they have a common element that they share.
[03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:15.870]  And that is Bitcoin being a decentralized blockchain cryptocurrency.
[03:30:16.770 --> 03:30:17.790]  It's private.
[03:30:18.530 --> 03:30:19.190]  That is private.
[03:30:19.409 --> 03:30:21.709]  That's the whole point of decentralized blockchain.
[03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:27.809]  Gold and silver, private, dealer non-reportable transactions, right, that you can also use as barter.
[03:30:28.129 --> 03:30:36.510]  Two different, completely different methods that people can use to protect themselves against a fiat-based currency like the dollar.
[03:30:36.829 --> 03:30:45.370]  So to say that Bitcoin and gold are competitors of each other, they're not competitors against the US dollar.
[03:30:45.530 --> 03:30:46.889]  It's like, no way.
[03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:48.670]  You've got to be kidding me.
[03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:54.010]  The reason that gold is going up, it's a barometer against political distrust.
[03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:55.110]  That's what it is.
[03:30:55.250 --> 03:30:56.329]  And so is Bitcoin.
[03:30:56.329 --> 03:30:58.770]  Now, you do get speculative gains with those too.
[03:30:58.889 --> 03:31:01.790]  I mean, that's why people want to grow their portfolios.
[03:31:02.629 --> 03:31:06.129]  But they also go into it because they don't trust the government anymore.
[03:31:06.659 --> 03:31:21.780]  Jerome Powell, they don't trust what you're doing with our money at the Fed and printing it willy-nilly and devaluing it and losing our reserve currency status because we have $36 trillion worth of debt that you created.
[03:31:21.780 --> 03:31:23.780]  Of course, people are gonna look elsewhere.
[03:31:24.340 --> 03:31:27.159]  So don't say it's not a competition to the US dollar.
[03:31:27.520 --> 03:31:28.840]  It's a dumb thing to say.
[03:31:29.120 --> 03:31:29.840]  Really, that's so dumb.
[03:31:29.979 --> 03:31:38.899]  But these are the kind of policies, and this is probably why Jerome Powell and President Trump are actually kind of at odds with each other.
[03:31:39.020 --> 03:31:41.899]  And Powell says, I don't care if Trump asks me to resign, I'm not gonna.
[03:31:43.299 --> 03:31:45.899]  Like, well, you might just have to, right?
[03:31:46.079 --> 03:31:51.620]  I mean, so there's gonna be a lot of opposition to central bank policies ways, right?
[03:31:51.840 --> 03:31:55.860]  So let's look at some more of Trump's policies, tariffs.
[03:31:56.180 --> 03:31:58.139]  What are they gonna do to gold and silver?
[03:31:59.020 --> 03:32:01.120]  Right, so this is really interesting.
[03:32:02.319 --> 03:32:07.620]  On the COMEX exchanges globally, there's over 145 of them that are approved.
[03:32:07.940 --> 03:32:12.799]  Over 40 of those, 145, come from the BRICS nations.
[03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:19.219]  So it's like, hmm, you put 100% tariffs on BRICS countries' goods?
[03:32:19.639 --> 03:32:21.639]  What's that gonna do to the price of silver?
[03:32:21.920 --> 03:32:22.639]  Could double.
[03:32:23.319 --> 03:32:24.719]  Right, or the price of gold.
[03:32:24.899 --> 03:32:27.479]  So here's the economic implication of that.
[03:32:27.719 --> 03:32:38.899]  As we're starting to transition into a new era economy, right, where you're going to probably have digital currency, you're going to have tangible assets running parallel with each other.
[03:32:39.159 --> 03:32:43.899]  Because central bank fiat-based money as we know it is going the way of the dodo bird.
[03:32:44.579 --> 03:32:49.139]  So when you put tariffs on all those goods, it depends on the mint mark.
[03:32:49.299 --> 03:32:54.520]  What is the hallmark of the bars or coins and what country did they source in?
[03:32:54.600 --> 03:32:55.739]  Doesn't matter where they're stored.
[03:32:55.959 --> 03:32:57.100]  Where did they come from?
[03:32:57.440 --> 03:33:02.020]  They're from one of the BRICS nations, which is like 40 of the 145 refineries.
[03:33:02.489 --> 03:33:10.290]  You're gonna have the price go up by whatever the tariff amount is, plus the normal price gain from the demand of supply and demand issues, right?
[03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:16.930]  So I see Trump tariffs being an absolute huge boon for silver.
[03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:19.569]  Massive, right?
[03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:26.709]  Because these tariffs could actually cause the price to go up because that's where a lot of it is refined and where it comes from.
[03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:30.670]  So now, who else is seeing problems here?
[03:33:31.299 --> 03:33:33.340]  Let's look at Poland, right?
[03:33:33.540 --> 03:33:40.819]  So Poland is doing what Alex and I have been telling all the info warriors out there to do for a while, and that's allocating to gold and silver.
[03:33:41.020 --> 03:33:42.739]  So Poland is not China.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:44.260]  Poland is not America.
[03:33:44.459 --> 03:33:46.579]  They're not a big, huge, wealthy country.
[03:33:46.819 --> 03:33:48.139]  They're relatively small.
[03:33:48.899 --> 03:33:53.680]  Who was the largest purchaser of gold last year, or this year, in 2024?
[03:33:54.479 --> 03:33:55.319]  It wasn't China.
[03:33:55.479 --> 03:33:56.100]  It wasn't America.
[03:33:56.500 --> 03:33:57.799]  It was Poland.
[03:33:58.709 --> 03:34:00.610]  So why would they do that?
[03:34:00.750 --> 03:34:05.209]  So if you were to ask me, hey, Dr. Kirk, who's the president of Poland?
[03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:06.010]  I don't know.
[03:34:06.209 --> 03:34:07.569]  Show me a picture of him or her.
[03:34:07.690 --> 03:34:08.290]  I don't know.
[03:34:08.370 --> 03:34:09.590]  I wouldn't be able to recognize him.
[03:34:09.690 --> 03:34:11.649]  I have no idea who they are.
[03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:18.110]  But what I could tell you is they're strong leaders, whoever they are, because they're seeing the writing on the wall.
[03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:25.350]  Poland is geolocated right in the backyard of Russia and Ukraine where there's potential nuclear war about to happen.
[03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:32.209]  They must be seeing the global debt dynamics and the implosion that's happening globally with banking crisis.
[03:34:32.729 --> 03:34:36.909]  Countries printing money like there's no tomorrow, a new central bank digital currency company.
[03:34:37.170 --> 03:34:37.950]  So what are they doing?
[03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:40.290]  They're allocating into gold.
[03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:42.489]  This is incredible.
[03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:47.750]  Not even a big huge country, but they're the largest purchaser of gold on the planet this year.
[03:34:48.479 --> 03:34:55.979]  And so gold demand and silver are exploding in value, right?
[03:34:56.200 --> 03:35:03.079]  And as you look at these kind of things, the fundamentals that cause their growth are getting worse.
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:11.959]  Right, which is political distrust, banks running out of money, a debt super cycle that's about to implode.
[03:35:12.159 --> 03:35:23.739]  And this is why, Jerome Powell, people are looking at cryptocurrency and tangible assets like gold and silver as options to central bank fiat money.
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:31.260]  Because we seem to know, Poland seems to know, right, that fiat money is going to go away.
[03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:41.500]  I bet, you know, Alex and I talk a lot about these things, but I don't know if we're going to have paper money two years from now.
[03:35:41.879 --> 03:35:44.620]  You know, if I were a betting man, I am not.
[03:35:44.819 --> 03:35:58.020]  I would say at the trend that we're going towards digital money, cryptocurrency, centralized wallets from central banks, I don't know if paper money, paper dollars, paper currency anywhere is going to be a thing two years from now.
[03:35:58.579 --> 03:36:00.239]  The pendulum has shifted.
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:04.680]  It's a paradigm shifting moment for the global monetary system.
[03:36:04.920 --> 03:36:15.239]  And so as that change happens, you're going to have turbulence and you're going to have chaos and you're going to have people not knowing what to do and what do they invest in and how do they operate and how do they function.
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:18.219]  And we don't want this CBDC stuff.
[03:36:18.340 --> 03:36:20.719]  It might be the mark of the beast or probably is.
[03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:22.700]  And so what are you going to do?
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:25.879]  This is why people are looking to those two things.
[03:36:27.299 --> 03:36:31.219]  They're looking at decentralized blockchain cryptocurrency, and they're looking at gold and silver.
[03:36:32.239 --> 03:36:36.920]  Different people have different desires, right?
[03:36:37.299 --> 03:36:41.500]  Most of my clients all just absolutely love tangible assets because it's real.
[03:36:41.620 --> 03:36:42.239]  They can touch it.
[03:36:42.319 --> 03:36:42.899]  They can use it.
[03:36:42.959 --> 03:36:43.840]  They can barter with it.
[03:36:44.299 --> 03:36:50.059]  And the younger clientele, they actually have a position in cryptocurrency too, which is not so bad, right?
[03:36:50.139 --> 03:36:52.079]  It's just, what is your tolerance level?
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:53.200]  Do you understand technology?
[03:36:53.379 --> 03:36:56.680]  Do you even understand how cryptocurrency works, how to set up your wallet, and so forth?
[03:36:56.959 --> 03:37:07.159]  So look, the point is, people are moving away from the way things were with central bank fiat money.
[03:37:07.500 --> 03:37:09.379]  That era is ending.
[03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:16.770]  Right, so when you look at how this is all changing, there is a changing of the guard, right?
[03:37:16.889 --> 03:37:23.350]  You look at the BRICS nations and they are allocating into gold like it's nobody's business.
[03:37:23.549 --> 03:37:34.370]  The United Arab Emirates, which is now a BRICS nation as of January of this year, surpassed London as the world's second largest gold hub on the planet.
[03:37:35.409 --> 03:37:47.010]  And so here's something that I think, when it comes to tangible assets, gold and silver, this is the biggest story of the year for gold and silver.
[03:37:47.209 --> 03:37:49.969]  And it's what happened over the weekend in China.
[03:37:50.489 --> 03:38:00.989]  So gold demand is gonna soar because banks in China are now blocking, they're blocking clients from purchasing physical gold.
[03:38:01.489 --> 03:38:02.510]  It's like, what?
[03:38:02.909 --> 03:38:03.930]  Wait a second.
[03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:11.590]  Dr. Kirk, you and Alex are talking about how a year ago, China was encouraging all of its citizens to buy gold.
[03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:12.510]  Yes, they were.
[03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:16.110]  This is 180 degrees opposite in a weekend.
[03:38:16.350 --> 03:38:20.870]  So why were they encouraging their citizens to buy gold?
[03:38:21.069 --> 03:38:23.870]  Well, they're amassing mountains of it, right?
[03:38:24.350 --> 03:38:25.690]  Hundreds and thousands of tons.
[03:38:26.569 --> 03:38:31.370]  And they wanna back up their digital currency, their BRICS common currency, right?
[03:38:31.569 --> 03:38:36.969]  So if they can get the Chinese citizens buying gold, that's gonna increase demand and the price is gonna go up.
[03:38:37.069 --> 03:38:41.479]  And when you own mountains of it, Well, that's an amazing thing, right?
[03:38:41.659 --> 03:38:51.260]  Well, now, what this signifies to me that Chinese banks are blocking people from purchasing gold is that the end game is close.
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:56.940]  Central bank digital currencies and digital money are probably really, really close.
[03:38:57.120 --> 03:39:01.639]  Because what does gold offer that central banks don't have?
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:02.680]  And that's privacy.
[03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:06.670]  CBDCs are not about fixing a broken system.
[03:39:06.850 --> 03:39:08.049]  It's all about people control.
[03:39:08.270 --> 03:39:14.989]  It's about ideologically based testing on your bank accounts, on your spending, right?
[03:39:15.149 --> 03:39:23.350]  So if they don't like your digital social profile, your social credit score, what church you give to What political party you donate to?
[03:39:23.450 --> 03:39:24.750]  What kind of food you eat?
[03:39:24.829 --> 03:39:25.709]  Are you eating meat?
[03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:26.530]  Are you eating bugs?
[03:39:26.709 --> 03:39:27.989]  I mean, you name it.
[03:39:28.129 --> 03:39:32.670]  If your ideology doesn't match up with theirs, central bank digital currency can cut you off from your money.
[03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:34.629]  Gold is in opposition to that.
[03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:37.250]  Silver is in opposition to that because it's a private asset.
[03:39:37.450 --> 03:39:43.129]  So now in China, when they say they're gonna block purchases of gold, does that mean China all of a sudden hates gold?
[03:39:43.530 --> 03:39:45.170]  No, they don't.
[03:39:45.620 --> 03:39:48.860]  Or else they wouldn't have mountains of it by the hundreds and thousands of tons.
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:54.120]  It means they don't want their citizens to own gold.
[03:39:54.579 --> 03:39:56.200]  There's a difference there, right?
[03:39:56.579 --> 03:39:57.600]  So why?
[03:39:58.059 --> 03:40:06.079]  Because it's in opposition to what I think is coming really soon, and that's the emergence of digital money and central bank digital currency.
[03:40:06.239 --> 03:40:17.969]  And so if they block it, Well then, once this thing comes into fruition, CBDCs, well then people aren't gonna have an option to get out, because they'll block the transactions from happening.
[03:40:18.209 --> 03:40:28.229]  So a lot of the financial news on mainstream media are saying, ooh, Chinese citizens not being able to buy gold, that's gonna decrease the demand and gold price is gonna come down.
[03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:30.229]  Maybe temporarily true.
[03:40:30.750 --> 03:40:32.989]  Maybe in the very short term that's true.
[03:40:33.489 --> 03:40:36.110]  But I think this is gonna have the opposite effect.
[03:40:36.899 --> 03:40:40.219]  When you think about it, all you people watching this show, right?
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:50.120]  All of freedom loving people around the world, if they realize it might not just be Chinese banks, the big commercial banks in China.
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:51.840]  What if it's other Chinese banks?
[03:40:52.059 --> 03:40:57.459]  What if it's banks in other countries that decide we're going to block the purchase of gold?
[03:40:57.620 --> 03:41:02.840]  Because over 90% of the world's population is moving towards central bank digital currency.
[03:41:03.649 --> 03:41:07.290]  So to me, this is like a contagion that's gonna spread.
[03:41:07.489 --> 03:41:12.209]  And bank after bank after bank, I think is gonna start to do the same thing.
[03:41:12.409 --> 03:41:18.190]  So when people start to realize that, they're gonna flock to gold and silver.
[03:41:19.209 --> 03:41:20.590]  They're gonna allocate into it.
[03:41:20.729 --> 03:41:29.549]  And it's like, if they think that the bank is gonna hold their money from buying what they want, they're gonna go buy that before the bank stops them from purchasing it.
[03:41:29.690 --> 03:41:36.989]  So I think this move by China is actually going to increase the price of metals, not decrease it.
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:42.680]  Right, like the financial media is saying, because it doesn't make sense.
[03:41:42.940 --> 03:41:49.100]  If a bank is gonna withhold somebody's money from buying something, well, you better go buy it before that becomes a policy, right?
[03:41:49.540 --> 03:41:51.379]  This is just human nature.
[03:41:51.819 --> 03:41:57.959]  So this is why we do what we do, why we recommend what we recommend.
[03:41:57.959 --> 03:41:59.979]  It's just not an inflationary hedge.
[03:42:00.579 --> 03:42:07.040]  It's not just an investment that's gone up a lot over the last year, over the last two years, over the last three years, right?
[03:42:07.139 --> 03:42:08.379]  We're on an amazing trend.
[03:42:08.899 --> 03:42:15.659]  The trend is there because of fundamental forces in the economy that are causing people to be scared.
[03:42:16.020 --> 03:42:17.579]  Saying, I don't trust the government.
[03:42:17.739 --> 03:42:19.899]  I don't trust that my bank is gonna have money.
[03:42:20.079 --> 03:42:26.780]  We've seen the videos that Alex has shown over the last couple of years where FDIC is only 1.17% funded.
[03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:34.620]  1.17, what about the other 98 plus percent of people's deposits that don't have insurance backing?
[03:42:34.879 --> 03:42:35.819]  It's not there.
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:37.159]  They're underfunded.
[03:42:37.579 --> 03:42:40.979]  See, people are afraid of what's coming in the banks.
[03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:53.340]  And this is where things like what we're talking about, why people flee to tangible assets like gold and silver, why they flee to cryptocurrency, because it's outside of the system that can really be tracked.
[03:42:54.700 --> 03:42:57.680]  So if you have questions on it, give our office a call.
[03:42:57.899 --> 03:43:12.629]  Like Alex always says, call us 720-605-3900 and say that Alex sent you, or go to kepm.com forward slash gold And my team will answer your questions.

[03:43:25.829 --> 03:43:26.590]  Everyone's different.
[03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.850]  God bless you.
[03:43:28.010 --> 03:43:29.049]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:43:29.209 --> 03:43:29.389]  Bye.
[03:43:30.109 --> 03:43:36.709]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[03:43:37.209 --> 03:43:38.510]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[03:43:38.629 --> 03:43:39.950]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.370]  Thank you, sir.
[03:43:40.930 --> 03:43:44.530]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:43:44.649 --> 03:43:47.170]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:51.079]  That my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:43:51.239 --> 03:43:55.079]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:43:55.459 --> 03:43:58.040]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[03:43:58.219 --> 03:43:59.860]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:44:00.139 --> 03:44:01.719]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:44:01.799 --> 03:44:02.899]  And we're finally winning.
[03:44:03.100 --> 03:44:09.680]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask.
[03:44:09.709 --> 03:44:14.409]  I didn't ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:44:14.549 --> 03:44:24.590]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:26.110]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:44:26.270 --> 03:44:32.389]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[03:44:33.200 --> 03:44:40.120]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:44:40.559 --> 03:44:41.819]  The supplements are there.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:42.620]  They're great.
[03:44:42.799 --> 03:44:43.959]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:44:43.979 --> 03:44:45.319]  He's put everything into it he has.
[03:44:45.420 --> 03:44:45.979]  They're incredible.
[03:44:46.239 --> 03:44:55.940]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.

[03:45:30.559 --> 03:45:33.059]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:45:33.620 --> 03:45:37.559]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:45:37.899 --> 03:45:39.219]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:45:39.360 --> 03:45:40.000]  He's a fighter.
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:40.959]  Hell, he's my dad.
[03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:42.079]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:45:42.280 --> 03:45:43.700]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:51.899]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:45:52.079 --> 03:45:54.760]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:45:54.899 --> 03:45:55.860]  It's about my parents.
[03:45:56.420 --> 03:46:01.940]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[03:46:02.399 --> 03:46:05.440]  So, please support the info war today.
[03:46:05.700 --> 03:46:07.540]  Support my mother and my father.
[03:46:07.719 --> 03:46:10.540]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[03:46:10.799 --> 03:46:15.280]  And if 5% of the millions watching me go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[03:46:15.420 --> 03:46:20.899]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnaturals.com and thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:46:20.979 --> 03:46:24.540]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[03:46:24.959 --> 03:46:28.219]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:46:28.299 --> 03:46:29.840]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
