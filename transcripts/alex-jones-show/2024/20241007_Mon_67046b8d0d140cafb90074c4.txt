[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.839]  I just want to state this again, because I don't like talking about myself every day on the show and what's happening, but we're forced to because, as you've seen, we're national news, international news.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.239]  If they can take us down, they set the precedent to take everyone else down.
[00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.469]  Media Matters run by George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator.
[00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.589]  He said that on 60 Minutes.
[00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.730]  The news says that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.469]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.250]  Yes, yes. Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:52.079]  That's right. George Soros's Media Matters, they created a list Sites that post some of my content on YouTube.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.719]  And here it is. And most of these I've never even heard of.
[00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.920]  And they said, oh, look, they're posting his content.
[00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.640]  Take them down. And YouTube did.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.299]  I mean, when Media Matters snaps its fingers and says, jump, Google, a trillion-dollar company asked how high.
[00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.659]  The potential censorship of free speech, I think, goes to the core.
[00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.069]  of our country's freedoms.
[00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.790]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.790]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.769]  Now I can show you the headlines where they say they want to own the name Alex Jones, they want to own Real Alex Jones on X. They admit they want to set that precedent.
[00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:49.390]  The whole idea of now we are going to have corporations censor speech based upon their definition of fake news, based on their definition of hate speech,
[00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.849]  is opening up a Pandora's box.
[00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.170]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:11.439]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:22.219]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:28.550]  The Justice Department backed Deep State Has launched a new vicious attack on myself and Infowars.
[00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:40.189]  They're attempting to seize control of operations October 17th because they know coming up on November 13th Infowars is going up for sale at auction and they're worried patriots are going to buy it and the operation will continue on.
[00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:50.150]  They are pulling out all the stops, have introduced a lawsuit, the Democrat Party back group, in Travis County with judges they think they control.
[00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:07.830]  They literally This has been adjudicated to the Supreme Court, the Texas Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit, all of it, are saying they own my name and own me, and that, like I'm a corporation, they want a receiver appointed that owns me forever.
[00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.629]  That's why they didn't want to settle.
[00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:17.340]  They wanted it to be non-dischargeable, and when they shut down InfoWars of their successful It doesn't matter.
[00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.900]  Anything but a billion and a half dollars, they say they own me.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.560]  What was an indentured servant?
[00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:37.319]  If I'm an English youth and want to get to America, I will sign a contract saying that I will give seven years of labor to a master who will pay the price of a ticket to get across the Atlantic on a ship.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.050]  But when I sign that contract, I'm in for seven years of extremely tough labor.
[00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.569]  I might not survive it, because that master, I'm just a piece of property.
[00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.090]  He can do with me what he wants.
[00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.389]  I don't work hard enough, he can beat me.
[00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.629]  If he doesn't like the way I work, he can sell me to a neighbor.
[00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.469]  Indentured servants accounted for three quarters of the 130,000 English who came to the Chesapeake in the 1600s.
[00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.949]  Now, the courts have all ruled you can't do this.
[00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:15.629]  It's cut and dry. But they don't care because they believe they control the courts in Travis County, which they're now filing in.
[00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.089]  The Democratic Party has officially.
[00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.709]  They want me off the air when President Trump is president-elect.
[00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.029]  And they're moving to shut us down now on October 17th.
[00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.370]  I'll sleep on somebody's couch and do this broadcast.
[00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.350]  But the issue is, if I don't fight them in federal court and state court now...
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.920]  They will absolutely hamstring what I'm doing if they're successful and set this dangerous precedent.
[00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.680]  I've been up here like a baby bird chirping, begging for food because I don't want to give up.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.759]  And I hate begging, but I hate losing to the New World Order when we're so close to victory.
[00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.740]  A lot worse. Three words.
[00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.800]  Real. AlexJones.com.
[00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.300]  Go make a $5, $10, $100, $200, $1,000 donation to the First Amendment.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.600]  All right, I'm not going to let the enemies of freedom...
[00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.629]  Distract me and keep me from covering the news.
[00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:15.250]  And that's why the harass the living daylights out of me and every other prominent patriot is because they know we've got the truth and we know that we're going to defeat these people in the end.
[00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.949]  And we see that currently happening.
[00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.029]  We're turning the tide.
[00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:19.389]  We have the initiative.
[00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.110]  But I'm going to leave this here and then I'm going to move on from talking about myself for a while.
[00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.470]  There's a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that I'm not at liberty to get into yet on top of all the stuff you know about.
[00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:43.610]  I remember 12 weeks ago when I told you the US trustee appointed by the Justice Department to my bankruptcy Ordered the place shut down and ordered private armed security to come throw me out of the building.
[00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.529]  And I said, I'm calling the police. Where's the court order?
[00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.449]  They went, yeah. And the head of the company's like, yeah, we're not doing that.
[00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.230]  This is literally trying to have mercenaries do this.
[00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.970]  And when I first announced it on air, people were like, well, where's the footage?
[00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.269]  Did you want me to stick cameras in the faces of these people and escalate it?
[00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:59.329]  No, I just said, I'm going to call the police.
[00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.529]  I never got to that. And then days later, it came out in federal court.
[00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.350]  They'd done that. And they had a hearing two weeks later, and the judge fired them all over the news.
[00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.120]  Now, there's been a bunch of stuff happen since then.
[00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:16.220]  I've only told you about a third of it because for strategy reasons, I don't want the enemy to even know what we know and things like that because we've got...
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.259]  It's like Fight Club.
[00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.540]  Our people are everywhere.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.839]  I'll just say it. They've already figured it out, including inside their operations.
[00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.620]  So, yeah, America's pissed.
[00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.459]  And this is when we really turn the tide, see?
[00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.240]  Oh, the resistance is everywhere.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:43.189]  You guys are going to be as happy as Nazis in France at the end of World War II. So, that said, I'm going on air.
[00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:51.490]  The show's starting, and Lewis, the head of our social media, walks over and goes, I just got this email.
[00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.050]  We're supposed to hand over all the passcodes to X group to all the social media and everything at Infowars.
[00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.389]  And I said, no.
[00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:03.220]  Because the people that are involved with the court are here, and I'm not going to say they're bad guys.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.839]  I go to the other building, have a 20-minute conversation with them, and say, you go ahead and tee it up in front of the court.
[00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.939]  You're not doing that until this place is sold.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.079]  And they agreed and backed off of it.
[00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.939]  But that's the type of stuff that I've got to deal with in live time.
[00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:19.680]  And I'm not complaining. I'm not bitching.
[00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.459]  But believe me, you think I want to go off the air the first 20 minutes of the show?
[00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:26.000]  So just pray for us.
[00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.910]  But the intensity of all of this is a sign of the times.
[00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:38.769]  As Trump has said a thousand times, as I've said a thousand times, they're not trying to get me, they've got to get through me to get to you.
[00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:47.290]  They want to literally turn off the economy, turn off the money supply, and absolutely enslave the population.
[00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.290]  In fact, I posted on X yesterday, A financial reporter.
[00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.449]  He did a great job explaining the plan to reduce money supply worldwide.
[00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.329]  And I forgot to send it to the crew.
[00:07:58.529 --> 00:07:59.689]  But guys, go get it.
[00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.649]  It's on there. I want to play that coming up next hour.
[00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.089]  Or I'll find it and send it to you.
[00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:10.209]  I forget the exact headline. But it's a guy in his office with a bunch of cool gold-backed books behind him.
[00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:11.750]  You'll see the still image.
[00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:13.350]  Get it. Because it's only like three minutes long.
[00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.269]  But he nails it. We're coming to the end of the old financial order.
[00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.850]  The globalists want to bring in their world...
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.839]  Social credit score, central bank digital currency.
[00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:32.399]  Congress is set to pass a law to make the president a dictator to enforce the social credit score.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.899]  Headline, digital ID scheme makes strides in Congress despite rights advocates' opposition.
[00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:56.029]  And then we've got, dovetailed with that, another new Hillary Clinton quote, video, where she's on national TV saying she wants to, again, get rid of the First Amendment, just like she said a few weeks ago, just like John Kerry said last week, or they're, quote, going to lose control of everything.
[00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.169]  You already lost control, witch.
[00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:06.529]  Everybody hates you. So, Trump just surged to 14 points in major scientific polls.
[00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.429]  Multiple polls and the betting markets in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:21.590]  So they're just desperately running headlines that Trump's done and Trump has lost on CNN and Drudge Report to make you believe that if they're able to steal it, she actually won.
[00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.470]  The woman is a joke.
[00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.129]  So we've got that to get into here as well today.
[00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.389]  But that's where we are.
[00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:35.809]  And that's what's happening.
[00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:46.279]  And it is all emblematic of the climate we are in, which is hardcore tyranny.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.320]  So understand every article, every video, every upload you do, every person you talk to at church or on the street or at work or at the grocery store.
[00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:06.649]  Every person you talk to about the Great Awakening and the globalists being criminals and the human trafficking and the New World Order moves the needle.
[00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:13.690]  Every bumper sticker you put up, every little thing you do together moves the needle.
[00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.809]  So don't think for a minute you're not important.
[00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:18.669]  You are beyond important. You are everything.
[00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:26.389]  So, let me just say this.
[00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:36.299]  I'm an expert on weather control and weather modification because I've been on air over 30 years, and I've interviewed the father of the weather weapons.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:46.840]  When that was declassified, I've interviewed the pilots that run the operations, the ground control radar installations that they tell you are for Doppler radar.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.580]  That's only one use. It's for weather control.
[00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:53.120]  That's all declassified. And I see a lot of interest now.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.340]  Everything we do on the subject, it's 5-10 million views on X. And then I see the public finally understanding this is real.
[00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.460]  There are world treaties, UN treaties.
[00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:04.740]  The CIA admits they're involved in it with the Department of Energy.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.720]  Other governments are involved.
[00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.980]  And so I'm not going to do it today.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.620]  But I am collating a bunch of the history of it and a bunch of the real information on it from meteorologists and others.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:23.759]  And in the next few days, I'm going to do in-depth reports with the latest info on it for you.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:40.169]  But... The fact is, since 1967, the government certified at the Pentagon through Stanford Research Institute a 30-year program and certified they can create hurricanes even not in hurricane season.
[00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:51.690]  They can steer them, control them, make them stronger, make them weaker, and they can easily make them die in the ocean and dump their water.
[00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.570]  So, bare minimum, they're not blocking these hurricanes.
[00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.009]  And the U.S. government and hearings in Congress I've got.
[00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.769]  I mean, it's ridiculous how public it is.
[00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.350]  Admit, well, we only do it in North America.
[00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:10.509]  We've got an agreement with Canada.
[00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.590]  But Mexico won't be part of the agreement.
[00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:15.570]  And yeah, we can control the weather.
[00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.490]  And the treaty says that the nations can only do it with their own country.
[00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:21.370]  But of course, that affects countries around them.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:48.409]  And I've got articles about Dubai 20 years ago using Doppler radar to make the desert green and they can take a clear blue sky and in just six hours thunderstorms they oscillate the wavelengths to boil it down simply and make nuclei out of the ions that creates the electricity Just like a volcano erupts and it causes thunderstorms around it because the particles form nuclei and then water vapor sticks,
[00:12:48.549 --> 00:12:51.649]  you get droplets, clouds, they get thick and they fall.
[00:12:51.769 --> 00:13:04.029]  That's what rain is. But you can use electricity into the atmosphere to resonate the water vapor together and then that causes the rain.
[00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:10.590]  So you always hear about the big C-130s and other aircraft manipulating hurricanes.
[00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:20.250]  But from the experts I've had on, including the director of HAARP, General Benton K. Parton, the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, that was also the director of HAARP for five years.
[00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:23.669]  I mean, basically, and I'm not bragging, it's just I've been on there so long.
[00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:28.210]  I've interviewed more than anybody else.
[00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:33.129]  And then I realized over the weekend, I'm like, my God, we have a giant brain trust.
[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:40.289]  Just our reports, just our research, just who we've interviewed, we've got to repost all those old interviews because they're evergreen.
[00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.269]  But then update them with updates on what's currently happening.
[00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.549]  So imagine, again, as I said last week, you're Rip Van Winkle.
[00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:49.750]  Remember the story of Rip Van Winkle?
[00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:52.889]  He falls asleep under an apple tree, I think it is.
[00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.690]  And he wakes up 100 years later and there's cars and all this stuff.
[00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.269]  And he's like, what is this?
[00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:14.860]  So to the public, who isn't informed on this, weather control is like somebody 150 years ago, if they woke up from under an apple tree, And, you know, they saw cell phones and helicopters and jets and CAT scan machines.
[00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:16.279]  They'd be like, well, this is magic.
[00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.399]  No, it's just technology.
[00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:27.419]  And I used this example when I was speaking with Tucker a few weeks ago in Redding, Pennsylvania, to a packed House of Patriots.
[00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:30.220]  I said, hey, I'm going to do something here tonight that'll go viral.
[00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.080]  It'll be a big news story.
[00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:33.860]  And I said, spider goats.
[00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:36.159]  Those are goats that are part spider that create body armor.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.519]  I said, something else I'll tell you about them.
[00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:45.389]  I said for at least 30 plus years, they grow humanoids in cows for organ harvesting, but they never show you the actual cows or the humanoids.
[00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:54.529]  Instead of just harvesting a baby that's eight pounds or seven pounds, on average, seven pounds, six ounces, they can harvest up to 50-pound humanoids with full-size organs.
[00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.929]  And they're part cow, so the cow doesn't reject.
[00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:06.509]  The cow's a clone itself, and then the humanoids part of that exact cow, so it doesn't reject the humanoid.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.200]  And I said, just look up humanoid clones, chimeras.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:18.500]  Humanoid chimeras are gestating, that means growing in the uterus, of cows at facilities across America.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.080]  And everybody wrote that down.
[00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:27.820]  They looked at it and had like an eight, nine-year-old article out of MIT. Now, I knew about that 30 years ago when I first got on air.
[00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.200]  Because... Out of the gates, my show exploded.
[00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:34.299]  There weren't a lot of other shows like it.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.820]  And the real people that were smart would mail me, before the internet was big, these reports.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.840]  So I was on air 30 years ago talking about humanoid clones.
[00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:46.340]  There's MIT review, technology review.
[00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.600]  Human animal chimeras are gestating on U.S. research farms.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.700]  Okay? Now...
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.879]  And I said that's eight, nine years ago.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.200]  I'll go from memory. Yeah, 2016.
[00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:58.940]  So it's eight years ago. I nailed it.
[00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.340]  So that's just from memory.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:09.820]  Well, just like humanoids growing in cows and pigs, they've done it with horses too, but cows are their favorite.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:19.460]  By the way, when I worked for a large animal vet, there were whole ranches in Texas that just had clones of certain bulls and certain cows.
[00:16:20.019 --> 00:16:21.440]  You get the genetics you want, you do it.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.440]  And they were just back then going, oh, Dolly's the first clone.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.379]  No, it wasn't. That was the media telling you about it.
[00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:36.519]  So, they hide all this stuff to the ready to introduce it to you.
[00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:49.600]  Just like humanoid chimeric clones are a fact that was public 30 years ago, and back then they said it had been going on for 20 years, so that's about the time I was born, 1974.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.539]  So they've been admitting humanoid clones since 1974.
[00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:01.820]  1973. And it's the same thing with weather weapons.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.680]  So, people look, and of course, folks found this, and I went and looked it up, it's true.
[00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:10.799]  Even government flights, unless they're super top secret, are logged.
[00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:22.640]  So, for military bases, these big propeller-driven aircraft they send up, that's their favorite, the Pentagon for Weather Control, they launch these, and then they fly right into Helena.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:30.279]  Helena. And they fly around in circles, guiding it and controlling it.
[00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:33.490]  And then when they run out of fuel, they can fly for eight hours.
[00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:35.730]  Another one joins them right at the same time.
[00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.910]  They take off. They go.
[00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.069]  They manipulate the storm. They leave.
[00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:45.809]  And then you see them do a maneuver over the Carolinas, and they kill it and dump the water.
[00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.230]  And I have that footage.
[00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:52.170]  With the radar, and then overlaid the flights.
[00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:55.049]  And somebody went and did the research.
[00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:58.369]  I checked it out. It's true. Had like 10 million views on X this weekend.
[00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.000]  And people are looking at this going, is this real?
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.380]  Yeah, it's real.
[00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:09.059]  So, we've never had a whistleblower at these laboratories show us the humanoids.
[00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:14.980]  But they admit they're doing it, and it's got government and corporate funding in the tens of billions that we know of.
[00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:24.420]  I mean, I remember being like eight years old, and my dad loved and now defunct Omni magazine.
[00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:27.980]  And every month it came, and he would read it, and then I would read it.
[00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:40.029]  And I remember seeing in Omni magazine in the mid-80s an article about humanized mice.
[00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.269]  And the photo's famous.
[00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:45.109]  You've all probably seen it. Guys, type in mouse with a human ear growing on it.
[00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:50.670]  And it shows a hairless mouse with a big human ear growing on its back.
[00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.910]  Now, I remember when that broke.
[00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.569]  I was eight years old.
[00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:59.200]  It was probably... 1982, Omni Magazine.
[00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:01.519]  Hell, I bet people have clipped Omni Magazine.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  So if you go to Google and type in Omni Magazine mouse with human ear, I bet if you click Google Images, it'll come up.
[00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:11.420]  Hell, I'll do it here. Watch this.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:21.359]  So imagine in the early 1980s, that's already going on.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.250]  So you just go to Google and you type in Mouse with human ear growing on it.
[00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.490]  And it'll come up for you.
[00:19:31.109 --> 00:19:36.609]  Here, I'll do it. So that's what's going on here.
[00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.549]  And it's just like the...
[00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:42.589]  Yep, there it is. Good job, guys.
[00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:49.089]  There you go. Now, that's the image I first saw in 1982-83 in Omni Magazine.
[00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.950]  It's actually later on CBS News, if I remember correctly.
[00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.569]  They actually decided to show it.
[00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:57.259]  So, they got that in the early 1980s.
[00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.180]  What do you think they got now?
[00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.480]  Well, they admit what they've got.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:16.380]  They've got humanized mice that are part human, so that when they test biological gain-of-function weapons on them, it will have the same testing effect as on a human.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.180]  And I'm sure you've heard that they've created mice with human brains.
[00:20:21.819 --> 00:20:23.339]  And yeah, the experiment's been done a lot.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:31.700]  I mean, it's easy to, you know, just change the sequence of the area of the DNA of the mouse skin.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.940]  Or they can just go into the embryo and just, you know, add some of it in later.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.339]  And then it'll grow an ear.
[00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:42.460]  So, that's 1982.
[00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.720]  What do they have now?
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.279]  See, so I'm trying to get people's mindset into understanding what a quote is.
[00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:55.210]  Breakaway civilization-ish.
[00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.529]  And that's the reason the globalists hate me is I get people to think about this.
[00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:00.630]  And you're smart as I am.
[00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:07.990]  But once you're not thinking about fantasy football or Netflix or polishing your car, and I'm not saying that's bad, but it doesn't matter.
[00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.690]  Well, then you will start looking into what I'm talking about.
[00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:16.269]  Yeah, the crew pulled up from the official C-SPAN website.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.720]  June 29, 2016.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:29.319]  You can watch the whole thing. John Brennan admits total weather control by the CIA. Or 2018.
[00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:32.079]  Excuse me, I was misreading the notes. Was that 18 or 16?
[00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.240]  Oh, the clip was from 16, but they updated it on 18.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.759]  I guess they got their archives updated.
[00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:38.599]  There you go. So...
[00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:45.880]  And he talks about like we're idiots, like they're at the big table at Thanksgiving, we're at the little table.
[00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:53.240]  And he just says, and we keep this from the public because it might upset them, but we have weather control and we control the weather and it's a nice weapon as well.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:09.859]  And so the reason I harp on that, pun intended, is bottom line, bare minimum, they could kill every hurricane coming into the United States or weaken it, but they don't.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:17.319]  Instead, they do things, since they started recording the activity of hurricanes, that hurricanes have never done.
[00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:31.380]  And then they tell you it's your fault because you've got a car or a house or a rain stove that's gas-powered, that it's your fault, and you've got to pay them carbon taxes and lower your standard of living and not have children.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.019]  In fact, the head of the EU, and we're going to play the clip coming up.
[00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:38.759]  I posted it on X yesterday. So get that clip, guys.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:52.480]  She came out and said, we're following the Club of Rome, 1960s, MIT plan to depopulate and cut off resources to save the earth.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.000]  And she talked about last week the limits to growth.
[00:22:56.579 --> 00:23:03.039]  Now, if you watch my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, I talk about limits to growth and that Club of Rome document.
[00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:08.269]  That then got adopted by the UN and the WEF. That is what we're living under today.
[00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:20.069]  This whole program is to get control of civilization, put in a social credit score, and then cut off incrementally your energy and tell you as things get tougher, do what we say and we'll give you energy again.
[00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.630]  We'll give you food. We'll give you...
[00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:23.670]  Housing. We'll give you education.
[00:23:23.829 --> 00:23:27.809]  We'll give you medicine. But it's a trap because the more you submit, the less you get.
[00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:34.970]  And then you submit more and more for the dwindling resources until you're totally domesticated, slowly poisoned, and then killed.
[00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.609]  And as they kill you, they extract all the wealth out of you into the medical system.
[00:23:41.329 --> 00:23:45.890]  Because they don't want you running around watching Netflix and football games and having a bunch of kids.
[00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:49.009]  They think you're stupid because you won't grasp this stuff.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:55.000]  And they metaphysically sit around and admit it all on C-SPAN and write books how they're doing it to you.
[00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:58.799]  And then I get up here and warn you, and they separately on the news go, that guy's crazy.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.180]  There's no human clones.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.680]  That guy's crazy. There's no weather modification.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:13.799]  So they play this sick, sick, sick game.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.779]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:26.109]  I'm going to really be judicious and cover all the hurricane news, election news, police state news, national emergency news, martial law news, destruction of free speech news.
[00:24:27.069 --> 00:24:29.289]  I don't know what's going on with this clip since last week, man.
[00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:30.569]  It just keeps popping off.
[00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.410]  It just keeps doing it. It drives me crazy.
[00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:42.690]  I'm doing everything I can to be nice and calm and friendly and nice like Fonzie.
[00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:53.420]  Cool like Fonzie. Now, before we go to break, I'm going to say something very, very simple here.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.000]  History's happening now.
[00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.599]  The forces of evil are making their move.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:09.619]  What they're doing is fabulously evil and horrible, and they count on being able to suppress information so the public doesn't know what's going on, so you can't make a decision about it, about human-animal splicing.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.079]  It's not a movie, folks. It's real.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:21.220]  About weather control, about open promotion to pedophilia, about the globalists starting World War III, the New World War trying to replace you with robots.
[00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:23.700]  You have to learn what's happening.
[00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.500]  You have to organize. You have to say no.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.579]  And that's not work. That's exciting.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.079]  It's your destiny. You're supposed to want to fight.
[00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:32.279]  You're supposed to want to be engaged in the fight.
[00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:38.680]  So I want to thank all of you that supported at realalexjones.com and made donations to the Legal Defense Fund.
[00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:41.559]  The Globals will spend tens of millions trying to shut us down.
[00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:44.940]  It just takes a million or so for me to hold them off for another year.
[00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:47.299]  And we've already gotten over 200,000 donated.
[00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:49.720]  I want to thank you. So they're pulling their hair out.
[00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:51.900]  They're in USA Today and all over the news.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.380]  How dare him out of legal defense?
[00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:57.339]  All his money belongs to the families who didn't want to settle and don't want money.
[00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:01.500]  They want me silenced. So thank you for donating at realalexjones.com.
[00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.730]  And I also want to thank everybody that goes to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:14.369]  And let me show you what just came in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:18.329 --> 00:26:23.710]  This is something that's next level and something I'm going to be talking a lot about, and I only bring you things that are game-changing.
[00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:28.549]  But of everything we've ever put out, This is the game changer.
[00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:33.549]  If you think X2 and X3, deep earth crystal ionium are game changing, they are.
[00:26:33.849 --> 00:26:36.230]  Nobody ever put this out until I started 12 years ago.
[00:26:36.569 --> 00:26:41.710]  If you get a DEA license from deep earth crystals on the ground, it goes right into your bloodstream and does amazing things.
[00:26:42.890 --> 00:27:10.589]  The only thing you could say might be as good or maybe even better is sea moss and that's why it's been all the rage the last few years because it has no mercury in it unlike fish but it's bioavailable because it's in the special type of sea moss and it delivers all these super nutrients and the ring structures of how the nutrients are together bound with the iodine and other things does incredible things in the body.
[00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:22.269]  So if you want energy, libido, stamina, immune system, your skin to look beautiful, if you think the iodine was great, this is next level.
[00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.309]  It's the ultimate CMOS gummies.
[00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.369]  It's a concentrate. It's super strong.
[00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:28.069]  It will blow you away.
[00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:32.309]  It'll take a week or so for the effects for you to start seeing, and I've taken it for a month.
[00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.789]  It's incredible. I've been taking these for over a month.
[00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:39.750]  It's one of the reasons that I'm so much healthier and look so much better.
[00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.970]  And now it's available to you exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.410]  There's a lot of CMOS out there and a lot of it's great.

[00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.890]  This is the best from the top manufacturer that lets us private label it.
[00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.450]  There's only one other place to get it.

[00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.009]  There's some new t-shirts there as well.

[00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:14.289]  Thank you all for your support. Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.130]  You're the reason we're still on air. Thealexjonesstore.com and donate at realalexjones.com.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.099]  Alright, here's what's going to happen.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.519]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:26.339]  More stuff's breaking that's just blowing me away.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.299]  Next segment, we have the video.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.099]  Shock video. U.S. military helicopter destroys volunteer donation site for hurricane victims.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.480]  That's coming up.
[00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.980]  Trump's 14 points ahead in Pennsylvania.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.940]  They're going into total conniption feds.
[00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:45.950]  I also want to get to black folks really waking up some very powerful videos.
[00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.069]  And I want to open the phones up.
[00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:55.750]  So I'm going to blitz through news once in about five minutes when we join 300 plus stations that come on at six after that join us.
[00:29:56.329 --> 00:30:03.259]  And then at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to give the number out On election 2024, what are they going to try next?
[00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:11.980]  The hurricane and people obviously want to talk about attempts to shut down Infowars and the latest developments and what you think we ought to do and what you think is coming next.
[00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:15.500]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:16.980]  But I'm going to say it again.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.579]  I don't want to sit up here and plug, plug, plug all day.
[00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:26.789]  But if we don't get our sponsors supported, and if we don't get the Legal Defense Fund supported, the bad guys are going to win.
[00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.009]  You don't want that to happen.
[00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.309]  They hate this operation.
[00:30:29.609 --> 00:30:35.470]  And there's nowhere that you can battle the globalists more than supporting this broadcast.
[00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.589]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.670]  Plus... People that get the iodine get blown away.
[00:30:40.809 --> 00:30:42.349]  People that get nitric boost get blown away.
[00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.650]  People that take our nootropics, like Turbo Force, they go, God, this is the best energy I ever had.
[00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.490]  We don't make stuff up.
[00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.029]  But yeah, we're in the face of the globalists.
[00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:53.869]  I've got to charge up, and I'm willing to fight.
[00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.430]  I'll never back down. You know, we face prison, you know, all of it.
[00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.089]  I personally paid a heavy price.
[00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.130]  So is the crew. Owen's gone up and sent to prison.
[00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.769]  I won't give up, but I can't do this without you.
[00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.529]  And I just ask you to keep me in the fight.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:19.720]  So please, we're going to hear this little piece I shot this weekend on the limited edition Halloween shirts, and then I'm going to stop plugging and come back and just judiciously put my nose to the grindstone and cover the nose.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.559]  But again, this is your chance to be part of history.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.799]  So share the article, share the videos, pray with the broadcast.
[00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.200]  And I want to thank you all that have supported.
[00:31:29.339 --> 00:31:31.319]  Incredible job. You give me a lot of hope in the fight.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.119]  And there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes, and I intend to come out of this one way or the other stronger thanks to you.
[00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:39.009]  Again, you get the credit.
[00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.190]  It's all you.
[00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:43.109]  And I keep hammering that, but history's now.
[00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.769]  Time for action is now.
[00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:47.930]  We'll be right back with all the news, your calls, and more.
[00:31:48.069 --> 00:32:01.670]  Stay with us. All right, we are in hour number two of this Monday, October 7th, 2024 transmission.
[00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.109]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:11.029]  All right, I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour and continue covering breaking news and information as it unfolds.
[00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:22.490]  But right now, I'm going to do a massive news blitz on the economy, on the new hurricane, on the current FEMA sabotage going on in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other key states.
[00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:26.799]  Hillary Clinton coming out again and calling for total censorship.
[00:32:28.059 --> 00:32:29.700]  Trump 14 points ahead.
[00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:35.759]  Turbo-charging even in scientific mainline polls in Pennsylvania.
[00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:40.019]  It's all coming up today.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:52.680]  But the first thing I want to do is play a clip of economist Michael Gibson who does a good job in just a few minutes boiling down what's already happening around the world and what's starting to happen here.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:01.960]  The globalists are turning down the velocity of money while creating more debt and creating depressionary conditions.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:08.339]  That's stagflation for the general public while they give themselves unlimited money through the central banks to buy everything up.
[00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:10.579]  It's a vertical integration.
[00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:18.119]  It's a scorched earth system where the bureaucrats working for the big private banks use policy as a weapon.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.930]  Here he is. the steps that are going to take place.
[00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.170]  Now, once the FedNow system goes in place, it's supposed to go online July 1st.
[00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:29.670]  That's the infrastructure that allows the CBDC to work.
[00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:39.250]  Now, they're saying the cover story, if you Google what that is, it says it's a payment processing, point-to-point, so it's instantaneous.
[00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:41.230]  That's all bullshit. That's the cover story.
[00:33:41.309 --> 00:33:47.089]  Because if they told you this is the infrastructure for what's going to make you a slave from now on, nobody would go for it.
[00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:54.009]  Like, they would revolt. So they have to put a cover story out about what it is so that you'll allow it to go in place.
[00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.069]  So just know that that story is bull.
[00:33:56.329 --> 00:34:05.769]  Once that's in place, you'll watch the markets start to decline because now they're set up and they need to crash the markets, cut off the supply of money, which is already happening in other countries.
[00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:11.829]  If you've not seen the videos because they only last a few minutes when people post them, Before they take them down.
[00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:17.469]  Of the riots going on and the banks being burnt to the ground in other countries right now.
[00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.070]  Because they've already seized their money.
[00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.590]  They've got a total blackout on it in the media.
[00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.489]  I want to get that guy on.
[00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.070]  His stuff's dead on. I was watching a lot of it this weekend.
[00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.530]  I already knew he was, but I just kind of did a little bit of a binge.
[00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.710]  Here it is right here today.
[00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:35.269]  Gotta go read this article. It's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:53.960]  It links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that runs the UN Global Standardization Program for the World ID, the Social Credit Score, and the Central Bank Digital Currency Social Credit Score Internet ID. Digital ID schemes make strides in Congress despite rights advocate opposition.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:06.800]  And it goes over the bipartisan group that's very close to getting it passed and setting up the Digital Identity Task Force under presidential executive order, total control to force you onto a central bank digital currency.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.519]  Trump has pledged to kill that.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:20.380]  And it goes on to talk about how it's being run and will take the advice of the UN Task Force headed up by Bill Gates.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.820]  Pretty powerful stuff that you need to go read for yourself.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.300]  It has links to the documents and to the legislation.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.000]  Now, why is that again so important?
[00:35:38.279 --> 00:35:44.739]  Well, if you think that it's just for Alex Jones, look at this.
[00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:46.739]  And I knew about this behind the scenes.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:52.139]  You know, you've heard Eric Trump say, for every story you see with us being attacked, there's 10 others.
[00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:56.880]  Same thing with me. They attack you not just to try to shut you down, but to also distract you.
[00:35:57.599 --> 00:36:05.280]  Melania Trump reveals on Fox News she was debanked and banned from her business email provider and her shopping carts and more.
[00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.130]  But she should have gone into who did it.
[00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:09.750]  You have to fight back against them.
[00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.550]  You can watch the whole interview on Fox and see it for yourself.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.590]  So, even Melania Trump has this done to her.
[00:36:19.269 --> 00:36:28.070]  Now, here's a very important clip of Ursula van der Leyen, the unelected head of the EU. You go, wait a minute.
[00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.929]  The European Union has elections.
[00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.489]  They have a parliament, which is advisory.
[00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:37.389]  Now, it's still a bully pulpit, but it's ceremonial.
[00:36:37.949 --> 00:36:53.170]  In a 1947 steel agreement in London, after World War II, when Europe was controlled by the Marshall Plan and U.S. and British forces, they made them sign a steel deal to put a governing banking board over Europe.
[00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.809]  Then with the Treaty of Rome, this is all my film, Endgame.
[00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.989]  It's free online, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:01.369]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:04.099]  You should watch it. It's ultra green.
[00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:09.360]  It's not just evergreen. It's better than when I made it in 2007 because it's all come true.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:16.280]  And by the end of the film, I tell you what the next agenda will be in Agenda 2030, which you're now living in.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.780]  And you'll be like, my God, it's a two and a half hour film.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.659]  The first two hours has all come true.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.119]  The last 30 minutes, I bring you to where we are now.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.940]  And then what happens next? Might want to have the blueprint of the enemy.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.480]  That's why it's called end game.
[00:37:31.539 --> 00:37:34.320]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:39.739]  And I'm intending to make a new Endgame.
[00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:46.239]  That's something like, you know, Endgame.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.420]  Final War. I mean, it's...
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:58.400]  There's a movie, Marvel Comics' biggest movie, Endgame, and it's all about depopulation of the galaxy.
[00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:05.809]  By Thanos. Well, I had to talk to the writers on that, and Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavement influenced it.
[00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.909]  It's like Dave Mustaine made his album, Endgame, and said it's based on the film.
[00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:18.789]  Not bragging, I'm showing you the cultural power we all have.
[00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.690]  Even you might be on AXS TV today, or a local radio show, you don't think you're influencing somebody.
[00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:35.329]  You are. Before they took it off Google Video, because they got rid of Google Video, 2011, it had 80 plus million views on Google Video.
[00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.889]  There it is on Bandai Video if you want to go see it.
[00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.989]  Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavement.
[00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.909]  We should re-upload that text.
[00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:44.150]  We did, but we should re-upload it again.
[00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.250]  You know what? I will re-upload it tomorrow, but I'm going to shoot an intro to it.
[00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:49.989]  And I'm going to shoot some updates throughout it.
[00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.469]  Ooh, I'll put out an in-game blueprint for global enslavement update.
[00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.469]  That's what I'll do. I don't want to wait.
[00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.690]  I want to get it out now. Write that down, folks.
[00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.349]  Don't let me forget, crew. So, I'm digressing.
[00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.750]  A lot of the news to hit. But before I show what Vander Leiden's saying, let me give you some background.
[00:39:08.289 --> 00:39:11.929]  So in 1956, they create the Treaty of Rome...
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.480]  Which officially sets up the EU. And then they don't officially launch it to the public until 2000.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.420]  And now it's always dissolving power of the governments and overtaxing.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:30.059]  And so the EU commission that runs it is unelected.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.039]  And Herman von Rumpi was the last head of it before Ursula von der Leyen.
[00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:43.320]  And Herman Van Ruppe is the main heir of all the Nazi fortunes and owns Luxembourg.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.940]  Way richer than Elon Musk, but his wealth is so great.
[00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:48.719]  The real rich, you never hear about it.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.800]  He's royalty, by the way.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.980]  So you have royalty owning the EU, owning countries in the EU outright.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.119]  He's the guardian of Luxembourg.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.480]  Look it up. And then he hands the baton to her, all part of the same group, same families.
[00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.289]  And they're unelected.
[00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:10.530]  And here she is talking about limits to growth.
[00:40:11.269 --> 00:40:16.969]  Which is the Club of Rome battle plan adopted into world government as policy.
[00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:22.449]  And then adopted in 1972 in State of Memorandum 200.
[00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.909]  That's also public.
[00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:28.510]  And it calls for global government to carry out the orderly.
[00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.550]  What? Cutting off of energy depopulation.
[00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:34.750]  And they've now gotten to where they wanted to be.
[00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:40.980]  First they take over the planet through economic warfare, then they start killing everybody.
[00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:47.079]  And the COVID shot was just the beta test, 30 plus million dead.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:53.519]  And their argument is, if you're not serious and don't address this and don't care and don't organize against it, you deserve to die.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.360]  Well, now Elon Musk talks about all this.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.280]  Elon Musk sounds like Alex Jones because it's the reality.
[00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:09.460]  And I've been saying this a thousand times or more.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.860]  What I'm covering is the real world.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.320]  Not little political rabbit trails, not all these distractions.
[00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:31.199]  All the things I talk about are really going on in a breakaway civilization is when we live at one technological level, like Hunger Games, and then the elites have their high-tech system It's broken away from us that we're kept out of.
[00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:38.800]  And they already have life extension technologies where people can easily live if they start the programs early to 150.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.679]  Then they believe if you can live that long, they'll have immortality.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.500]  And they don't want the general public to have that.
[00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:47.000]  So that's what I show you in Endgame.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.300]  That's what they admit in Endgame.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500]  And that's why you should watch Endgame.
[00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:54.880]  Because this is what's happening.
[00:41:55.739 --> 00:42:05.199]  Do you care? Because if you can't care about yourself and the future of our species, then you are helpless in the face of the New World Order.
[00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:10.579]  So here she is. Thank you very much, dear Philippe.
[00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:12.219]  Honorable members, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:25.500]  Indeed, if we look back, a little over 50 years ago, the Club of Rome and a group of MIT researchers published the Limits of Growth report.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:33.820]  It mapped the interaction between population growth, the economy and the environment.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.739]  And it came 50 years ago to address the conclusion.
[00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:46.440]  Stop economic and population growth or else our planet will not cope.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.820]  And as you know, this report has sparked a long controversy.
[00:42:53.449 --> 00:42:55.630]  And we got the full clip. She goes into all of it.
[00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.590]  But there she is. Oh, yes.
[00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:05.610]  It sparked a lot of controversy about you cutting off all the resources.
[00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:08.650]  A long controversy.
[00:43:10.769 --> 00:43:15.469]  All right. I want to play a clip of Tucker Carlson where he explains this.
[00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.429]  If you won't stand up for yourself and your society and culture...
[00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.690]  And you only engage through whatever the Wall Street Journal tells you about how you make the most money.
[00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:32.570]  By increments, you'll have money in the bank, at least for a little while, if you're in the top few percent.
[00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:35.449]  But the society around you is going to be falling apart.
[00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.989]  Your kids are going to be being brainwashed.
[00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:44.369]  You won't have a good culture or civilization to even spend the money in because you stand for nothing.
[00:43:44.449 --> 00:43:49.230]  And that's what the social credit score is, where they'll control and track everything you do and always...
[00:43:50.929 --> 00:44:00.989]  Raise the bar of what you've got to do and how you've got to submit to be able to be given a job or have access to the markets or travel or medicine.
[00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:05.469]  That's slavery. Who in their right mind would want to be chained up in the system?
[00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:12.329]  But just on the cultural front, did the open borders, did the free trade, was it good for us?
[00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:16.429]  No, it wasn't. In the end, it wasn't free trade.
[00:44:16.429 --> 00:44:20.210]  It was crony capitalism with select groups to consolidate power and control.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.369]  And now their endgame is in operation mode.
[00:44:24.789 --> 00:44:30.929]  Here's Tucker Carlson. Why have all these Republicans publicly announced that they're voting for Kamala Harris?
[00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:42.389]  If you told me ten years ago that Bill Kristol, who I spent five and a half years working for, Dick Cheney, who I knew, his creepy little daughter, who I knew very well, Mike Pence, all these people, they're all voting for Kamala Harris.
[00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.369]  The Bushes, all voting for Kamala Harris.
[00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:46.889]  George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, voting for Kamala Harris.
[00:44:47.429 --> 00:44:50.550]  How did that happen? Well, but they are.
[00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.889]  That's the problem. They just don't care about the country.
[00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:59.289]  They're mad that Trump might have one fewer war over the next four years.
[00:44:59.829 --> 00:45:03.369]  And that's like, it really, it's a clarifying moment.
[00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:05.110]  And I think this very often.
[00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:08.429]  I'm really grateful for how clear things are now.
[00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.630]  It's really obvious who's on whose side.
[00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:16.829]  And all I care about is preserving the country that I grew up in for my kids.
[00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:17.969]  That's not too much to ask.
[00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.750]  I don't want it to change radically.
[00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:21.170]  I don't want it to become much worse.
[00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:23.250]  Economic cycles come and go.
[00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.250]  But a culture, a people, that's permanent.
[00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.070]  That's permanent. I'd do 10 years of recession.
[00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:34.130]  I'd sell my house in exchange for not having a society completely transformed by foreigners.
[00:45:34.409 --> 00:45:36.489]  Okay, that's the truth. By not...
[00:45:36.489 --> 00:45:41.510]  I mean it. And there's no Republican who will say that.
[00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.670]  It's all about GDP and growth and whatever.
[00:45:44.769 --> 00:45:51.670]  It's like... What you're saying bears no resemblance to what I want, which is a stable, happy country.
[00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.809]  That's what I want. A stable, happy country.
[00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:56.690]  And I lived in one. I know it's possible.
[00:45:56.969 --> 00:45:59.510]  You destabilized it with your stupid wars.
[00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.829]  And last thing I'll say, no, I'm totally out of control.
[00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.389]  But these people should all have to answer for their foreign policy in the last 20 years.
[00:46:06.469 --> 00:46:11.949]  I covered that stuff. I was on the first plane out of D.C. to the Middle East after September 11th.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.699]  So I just, I'm not an expert.
[00:46:13.699 --> 00:46:15.820]  I never pretended to be one, but I've been to all their wars.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.900]  I've watched all this stuff.
[00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:22.619]  And I don't understand how the people who planned all that are still making the decisions and no one's ever had to apologize.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.219]  No one ever asks John Bolton, like, why haven't you apologized?
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.739]  You said we were going to get one thing.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.519]  We didn't get it. We spent trillions of dollars.
[00:46:30.619 --> 00:46:32.699]  We killed almost all the Christians in Iraq.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.519]  I am Christian, so I think it's fair to ask, like, what was that about?
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:37.980]  And you never apologized.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.880]  If my kids get a B in English class, they have to apologize.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:48.719]  Because that's the difference between a human being and a sociopath.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.019]  A human being grows by admitting fault.
[00:46:52.099 --> 00:46:54.960]  It's called repentance. And it's absolutely essential.
[00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:57.260]  There's no sin that I personally will not forgive.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:04.260]  I mean it. And there's no sin that I would not personally forgive another person if that person was contrite and asked for forgiveness.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.099]  Because that's what my religion demands.
[00:47:06.809 --> 00:47:19.530]  But if you're not even forced to apologize or express contrition, and instead you continue to rule my country, misrule it, we have a system that's so far out of whack that I'm surprised we haven't had some kind of revolution, because it's crazy.
[00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:23.769]  The Tea Party was one of the revolutions that occurred.
[00:47:23.769 --> 00:47:27.309]  Yeah, it was like the Tea Party January 6th, like the most normal people in the country.
[00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.610]  What was like, not one person on January 6th was carrying a firearm.
[00:47:30.849 --> 00:47:32.570]  What were they carrying? Pocket constitutions.
[00:47:33.429 --> 00:47:34.730]  They're carrying pocket constitutions.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.340]  So, like, and they went to jail.
[00:47:37.539 --> 00:47:39.460]  Like, some 65-year-old diabetic grandmother?
[00:47:39.639 --> 00:47:41.800]  Really? That's an insurrection? No, it's not.
[00:47:42.019 --> 00:47:46.000]  They were people who, some of them did rowdy things that I'm opposed to.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.179]  I hate vandalism, okay?
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.260]  But the overwhelming majority of them wanted to preserve the system.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.079]  That's why they were mad. They weren't trying to overthrow it.
[00:47:55.199 --> 00:47:56.300]  They were trying to preserve it.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.780]  And they watched our system in the process of being overthrown, which it has been.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.360]  And They're the villains?
[00:48:04.639 --> 00:48:06.320]  I don't think you're the villain, actually.
[00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:12.039]  If you want to preserve the greatest country in the world in some recognizable way, you're not the bad guy.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.480]  You're not the radical. I'm often called radical.
[00:48:14.599 --> 00:48:15.800]  I'm the least radical person you've ever met.
[00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:17.340]  I'm like the most moderate person.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.059]  I just want things to be... My parents got divorced.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.699]  I just... I don't like change.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.199]  I don't. I mean it.
[00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:25.039]  I'm not a radical. I'm just the opposite.
[00:48:25.579 --> 00:48:27.179]  Like, it was that way last year?
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.519]  Let's keep it that way. I kind of like that.
[00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:30.239]  I go to the restaurant, I know the same thing.
[00:48:31.339 --> 00:48:33.179]  I'm not a revolutionary. I hate revolutionaries.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.480]  Revolutions never make things better.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.239]  They always just wreck stuff.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.280]  I hate wrecking stuff. It took someone a long time to build that.
[00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:41.079]  It took you two minutes to wreck it.
[00:48:41.519 --> 00:48:48.320]  You're the villain. And so this grandmother who's like, no, the Constitution says this, she's the radical?
[00:48:48.719 --> 00:48:50.639]  No, you're the radical, Kamala Harris.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.179]  You hate the people of this country.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.980]  You hate the way things have been done.
[00:48:54.159 --> 00:48:55.519]  You despise our history.
[00:48:55.719 --> 00:48:57.559]  You despise the people who created this country.
[00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:00.360]  You're a scary Bolshevik radical.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.300]  We're not. We tie our boats together.
[00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.929]  You know, I was recently at dinner with Tucker.
[00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.869]  We had like a three-hour dinner after the event in Redding, Pennsylvania.
[00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:18.750]  And he's always talking about how he's not scared to die.
[00:49:18.809 --> 00:49:21.829]  And I said, why? And he told a story I didn't know.
[00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:27.710]  And I looked it up and found news articles about it the next day when I was flying back to Austin on the commercial flight.
[00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:34.329]  They had internet on there. And he went right after 9-11 to Afghanistan and to Pakistan.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.000]  And he was flying on a flight out like a month after the attack.
[00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:49.780]  He'd been in Afghanistan out of Pakistan on a major flight that had a bomb on it and blew up and then crash landed in the desert in Dubai.
[00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:53.590]  And then I'd never heard that story.
[00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.570]  I think he's only told it once. And I looked it up and did find out about that.
[00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.889]  But it was a blip on the radar back then because 9-11 was so big.
[00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:05.610]  A plane being blown up by terrorists with a bomb they smuggled on board, blew the side of the airplane out.
[00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:13.590]  And then they were like going through these mountains and for hours, you know, an engine going out like some Hollywood movie.
[00:50:14.599 --> 00:50:16.940]  And Tucker never even really tells that story.
[00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:18.579]  He was telling me the story. I believed it.
[00:50:18.639 --> 00:50:23.280]  I went and looked it up and found mentions of it on the news and that he was in the plane that was blown up.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.659]  They tried to play it down in the media.
[00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:29.840]  But man, what a crazy thing.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:36.920]  But the point is that I was meaning to get at here is they're attacking culture.
[00:50:37.949 --> 00:50:42.789]  And they're afraid of the American culture because they know that we resisted the British Empire and tyranny before.
[00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:52.969]  And if the world aspires to live in a free, open country with a big middle class, that's going to destroy their social credit score that's designed on making everybody super poor so that they can control you.
[00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.309]  It's really simple.
[00:50:54.730 --> 00:51:01.929]  And so they're in an economic and cultural and spiritual war And this really is a satanic attack.
[00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:06.730]  And I know this audience gets that, but the public is ready for the truth now.
[00:51:06.809 --> 00:51:12.469]  They're ready to be awakened. And people need to understand that there aren't any atheists at the top of the new order.
[00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.329]  They're occultists. They believe in the God of this world.
[00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.530]  They really do worship Lucifer, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:19.730]  They talk about it.
[00:51:19.769 --> 00:51:22.969]  It's in their literature, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:27.269]  They don't follow the God that we follow.
[00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.110]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson's talked about it once, but I found news articles.
[00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:35.250]  What Tucker learned from surviving a plane crash, it was the plane blown up by a bomb.
[00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:42.429]  But the State Department wanted to keep that quiet, and that was also in the news articles, because they didn't want to make the terrorists look like they had any power.
[00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:44.030]  But that's a side issue.
[00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:48.110]  But that near brush with death made Tucker who he is today.
[00:51:48.369 --> 00:51:52.630]  And that's the Nietzschean statement, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:51:52.630 --> 00:52:01.829]  But also, those that fight monsters need to watch out because you can become the monster, or Longer you stare in the abyss, you may become the abyss, to paraphrase Nietzsche, Frederick Nietzsche.
[00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:05.630]  So, that's the points I wanted to hit.
[00:52:05.769 --> 00:52:08.650]  All right. I'm going to come back, hit the hurricane news.
[00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:14.630]  Then I'm going to hit the revisionist history news that John Stossel got into.
[00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.530]  And people are celebrating this, Elon Musk tweeted it.
[00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:21.969]  And I like John Stossel, but it's got that conservative failure in it.
[00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:24.730]  That doesn't go all the way.
[00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:29.050]  So I want to take his great report that's 80% there, and I want to finish it.
[00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.710]  And we've also, again, got Trump surging in all the polls.
[00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:33.929]  What are they going to do to respond to that?
[00:52:34.489 --> 00:52:37.030]  We've got a bunch of military news here.
[00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:43.409]  There's another hurricane coming towards Milton, coming towards the west coast of Florida.
[00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.170]  I mean, this is just wild.
[00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.110]  They're saying it'll be one of the biggest storm surges ever.
[00:52:48.269 --> 00:52:49.610]  It's all coming up today.
[00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.570]  And then after I hit that news, it shouldn't take too much longer.
[00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:59.190]  I will open the phones up, and I'm just asking callers, screen your own call.
[00:52:59.289 --> 00:53:00.349]  Just have a clean phone line.
[00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.489]  We usually do free-for-all, any subject you want.
[00:53:02.989 --> 00:53:04.269]  Today, it's three big subjects.
[00:53:04.329 --> 00:53:07.050]  The election, Trump surging, what's the deep stake going to do?
[00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.610]  That's a huge subject area.
[00:53:09.849 --> 00:53:11.849]  The globalist attempts to shut down Infowars.
[00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.650]  What's your advice? What do you think about it?
[00:53:13.909 --> 00:53:14.969]  What do you think's coming next?
[00:53:14.969 --> 00:53:18.269]  I'd love to hear from you. You always bring up such amazing angles and points I didn't think of.
[00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:33.960]  And then also the hurricane and the ongoing stand down and Axelrod and others admitting, we have clips of it coming up, that it's great because it hit 24 of the 26 conservative counties that vote 70-80% Republican.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.559]  And so it's going to probably keep them from being able to vote and make North Carolina go for the Democrats.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.320]  So I was saying that over a week ago and now they're admitting it.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:47.260]  So this is just next level garbage.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.960]  But let me go ahead and just get the callers starting to stack up here.
[00:53:51.039 --> 00:53:54.800]  Let's give the number out now. 877-789-2539.
[00:53:55.159 --> 00:53:56.340]  877-789.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.980]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:54:01.659 --> 00:54:04.980]  On this live Monday, October 7th, 24 Transmission.
[00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:07.380]  InfoWars may be no more.
[00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:17.380]  Coming up in mid-November when it gets sold and the liberal groups are saying they're going to buy it just to shut it down.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.820]  But patriots say they're going to buy it.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.320]  What an exciting time to be alive.
[00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:27.949]  The Save Alex Jones Broadcast Limited Edition Fundraiser T-Shirt is available at dalexjonesstore.com.

[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:32.059]  All right, we're loading up the phone lines at 877-789-2539.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:40.139]  877-789-ALEX. Then I'll intersperse a lot of the news I've been talking about and more news as it breaks here today.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.360]  But I want to just say this right now to everybody.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:50.699]  You don't need me to tell you this or Elon Musk or Tucker Carlson or General Flynn last week in studio with us.
[00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:53.219]  We have the initiative.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.260]  We're winning. We've turned the tide.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.079]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:55:57.199 --> 00:55:59.840]  All over the world, populists and anti-globalists are winning everywhere.
[00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:09.230]  The New World Order itself and its own leaked white papers and public admissions at the Davos Group, the UN, undercover videos, public statements say everyone hates them.
[00:56:09.769 --> 00:56:12.130]  95% of people want to destroy them around the world.
[00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:14.130]  The UN thinks they're going to be abolished.
[00:56:14.969 --> 00:56:16.809]  James O'Keefe got a hidden video of that a month ago.
[00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.570]  Plus, their public statements.
[00:56:18.889 --> 00:56:19.969]  We are winning.
[00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:34.400]  But for those of us on the front lines, which I'm extremely honored to be, The enemy strategy is to put us in prison, debank us, harass the living son out of us, lawfare.
[00:56:35.019 --> 00:56:46.360]  So when you hold up President Trump, when you hold up Alex Jones, when you hold up Tucker Carlson or Elon Musk, who is beyond hitting on all cylinders, he is rampaging now.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.980]  He's doing more than Trump, quite frankly, in the information war.
[00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:55.300]  Devastation, devastation, devastation, annihilation.
[00:56:56.659 --> 00:56:59.940]  I'm so proud to have been saying Musk is good the last few years.
[00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:01.380]  He's definitely on the team now.
[00:57:01.679 --> 00:57:02.780]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.300]  Jesus said that. He is wrecking their asses.
[00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:10.579]  Well, he's worth $160 billion.
[00:57:10.739 --> 00:57:11.960]  Trump's worth like $5 billion.
[00:57:12.039 --> 00:57:13.659]  He was worth $10 billion. They've taken half his money.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.679]  Trump doesn't care. He cares less about it.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.360]  He wants to spend it to fight them.
[00:57:18.559 --> 00:57:19.860]  Trump's doing good on donations.
[00:57:20.039 --> 00:57:30.099]  War always is going to help. But little old Alex, because there's a big gap between Elon Musk and Trump, And Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, they reach more people than me.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:38.219]  But I, and listen to me carefully, Create the blueprints and analysis more than anybody.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.579]  My talking points, my terms, my understanding, and this is a battle report to you.
[00:57:43.659 --> 00:57:44.960]  Again, it's not me, oh, I'm so great.
[00:57:45.159 --> 00:57:46.340]  No, it makes me a huge target.
[00:57:46.599 --> 00:57:51.340]  The enemy, CIA, Carnegie Foundation, congressional reports, we've played them here.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.960]  If you're a new listener and don't know about this, look it up.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.320]  They admit that, and I used to hear this 10 years ago and go, I'm not that important.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.099]  I remember a Time magazine article back when they were still big.
[00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:06.679]  During the Tea Party, like 15 years ago, and they said, the most dangerous guy is Alex Jones.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.360]  He's the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[00:58:08.699 --> 00:58:11.980]  They had a big investigative report, a cover story, on the Tea Party.
[00:58:12.719 --> 00:58:14.079]  Multiple pages were about me.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:23.039]  And it said, our sociologists and the State Department have looked at him, and they've gone out and done studies in the Tea Party that was the launchpad for Trump.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.619]  And they said, Alex Jones and Ron Paul are the big threats.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:39.880]  Remember that? And they said, when we track back These giant crowds of people in this awakening, not just here, but in places like England and Germany and Australia, it tracks back to Jones.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:45.219]  So, everything Elon Musk says now sounds like I said it.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:55.099]  Rogan. Tucker Carlson said in his intro to my speech, I didn't know he was going to do that.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.960]  He said, Alex Jones is the most accurate person in the world.
[00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:00.219]  He's the smartest person I know.
[00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:04.389]  And he's a prophet. Now, I'm not saying about myself, and I'm not saying I'm a prophet.
[00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:07.170]  The point is, Tucker never talks about anybody like that.
[00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:15.610]  Tucker told me years ago, I never said it on air, because he came and visited me 10 years ago, and then after that, he said, I didn't believe you, I thought you were crazy, I did my own research on you, you woke me up.
[00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:27.389]  So, I'm the guy, this show, our guest, what we've done, you the listeners, that has been dominant in triggering what you see today.
[00:59:29.739 --> 00:59:35.239]  They are clips of my show in Hungary, in the Netherlands, in Russia.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.920]  He was insulted one time because I didn't do my research.
[00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:44.320]  It just said, head of the Japanese Congress wants to come on your show.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.400]  It's like 16 years ago.
[00:59:48.019 --> 00:59:51.000]  And I went, okay. And he came on.
[00:59:52.139 --> 00:59:56.559]  And he wasn't mad about it, but later their staff told me, well, he didn't like the fact you didn't say he was the vice president.
[00:59:58.199 --> 01:00:00.119]  I went with head of their legislature.
[01:00:00.699 --> 01:00:02.980]  I had the vice president of Japan on.
[01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:06.860]  He wanted to come on the show. Bolsonaro's on record saying I woke him up.
[01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:08.219]  His son is. I interviewed him.
[01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:10.679]  They invited me down there when he was president.
[01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:11.920]  I didn't go because I'm tied down here.
[01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:15.619]  Bukele admits he's invited me down to interview.
[01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:16.780]  I've been gone yet. I'm going to go soon.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.019]  It's not about, oh, I'm great.
[01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:26.139]  It's that we have to recognize that God put me in the position 30 plus years ago.
[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:34.150]  It's been only 30 years and 6 months, since April, 30 years ago, to do this, and the enemy knows that.
[01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:39.349]  And the enemy knows that I can see over the horizon, so can you.
[01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:50.949]  And so, whether it's the Southern Barbary Law Center or any of them, they see me as the main enemy.
[01:00:53.329 --> 01:01:04.030]  Because They called me the mad prophet that's out in the wilderness that foretold and is the precursor to the big movement that comes.
[01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.650]  And I said that 25 years ago, that God told me that.
[01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:11.869]  I've told you that a thousand times or more.
[01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.070]  So, that's why they want me off air.
[01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:27.090]  That's why they want to silence me so they can then lie about me and build a straw man That's not Alex Jones to hurt the liberty movement and populism worldwide.
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.210]  They don't want me to be a hero to the people.
[01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:30.710]  Well, you're the real heroes.
[01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:35.130]  So all I ask is, you understand how important we are.
[01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:39.469]  Because I know I'm a regular guy, you're regular folks, I'm here, I don't put on airs, any of that.
[01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:45.690]  But the enemy sees me as a top field marshal and a top strategist kicking their ass.
[01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:49.650]  And we have. Again, it's not just me, it's the whole operation.
[01:01:50.530 --> 01:02:02.159]  So, If I have the funds, which I'm completely out of money personally, to fight them, I can hold them up for a long time still.
[01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.599]  If I don't, they're going to win and just harass me into oblivion.
[01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.219]  I'll have to go to another country to broadcast.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.920]  I don't want to do that. Plus, I want the crew and the reports and the research, and we're so effective that way.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.800]  So, I'm humbly asking you, and I want to thank everybody that did go donate.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.300]  It touches my heart. I read all your comments.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.460]  When you donate at realalexshows.com, it takes you to Give, Send, Go.
[01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:33.559]  I want to thank everybody that donated there.
[01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:34.760]  And let's show the Give, Send, Go.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.739]  As of Friday afternoon, we started promoting it.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.980]  It's raised $203,000.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:46.199]  That sounds like a lot. Our enemies have spent over $70 million, they admit, in court filings, suing me in the last...
[01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:50.130]  Six years. I've spent over $15 million.
[01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:51.389]  Read my bankruptcy filings.
[01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:57.010]  $15 million you spent to hold us in attack position in the face of the enemy.
[01:02:57.090 --> 01:03:00.849]  You've been our shields while they're blasting us and you've kept us up.
[01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:06.210]  The shields have gotten weak and the enemy is in full attack mode right now trying to get us off the air.
[01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:16.530]  So I need you to recharge the shields if you want this key weapon in the fight against the dual order to stay in attack mode.
[01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:21.239]  RealAlexJones.com and I humbly thank you all for your support.
[01:03:22.159 --> 01:03:23.420]  And I'm going to get back on the news and your calls.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.780]  Separately, Another great way to find this is our amazing sponsor, Bigly.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.960]  They make the top Patriot t-shirts.
[01:03:32.159 --> 01:03:39.679]  They're behind the scenes, you know, being the big sponsor for a lot of the top talk shows that are out there, like Crowder and the Hodge Twins and so many others.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.239]  They make the very best t-shirts.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.099]  You go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.860]  You'll find ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies, all of it.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.320]  They've added hundreds and hundreds of items, more every day.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.860]  It's just insane. People are getting their stuff really quick.
[01:03:52.179 --> 01:03:57.690]  Everybody loves it. We've added a new fundraiser shirt that's more than the others if you want to really step up.
[01:03:57.889 --> 01:04:01.309]  The Alex Jones Show. We've never had an Alex Jones Show shirt with my signature on the right shoulder.
[01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:05.230]  If they shut down this operation and we come back, it'll be a memento.
[01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.050]  If we win, it's a symbol of victory.
[01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.670]  On the back, it says, you are the resistance.
[01:04:09.969 --> 01:04:15.889]  RealAlexJones.com. There's also the classic Infowars red with the American flag on navy blue.
[01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:24.670]  That's the most popular shirt, but those are both fundraisers that are basically twice as much as the other shirts because that way you can pay a little extra and know it really helps us.
[01:04:26.409 --> 01:04:27.809]  Because these shirts are such quality.
[01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.110]  I mean, the shirts cost like $12.
[01:04:29.409 --> 01:04:30.550]  The printing costs a couple bucks.
[01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.889]  You're talking $15 a shirt.
[01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:36.309]  The XXLs are even more, like $18 a shirt to make because they're done in America.
[01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:41.190]  That costs a lot more. So when you buy one for $50, we actually get a good chunk of money.
[01:04:42.849 --> 01:04:46.630]  It's like NPR. Gets hundreds of millions, 500 million, a billion in taxpayer money.
[01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.309]  They still do fundraisers constantly.
[01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:50.150]  Well, we don't get taxpayer money.
[01:04:50.769 --> 01:04:55.989]  But it's like when you give a $100 donation and get a t-shirt that costs them 20 bucks, it's a memento.
[01:04:56.309 --> 01:05:02.809]  Well, with this, you don't give 100 bucks, you give 50, and then some real money comes in after the cost of the shirt.
[01:05:02.929 --> 01:05:04.289]  You know, we're talking 25 bucks or so.
[01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:08.369]  So again... The AlexShowStore.com.
[01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:09.989]  But here's why you really want to go there.
[01:05:10.429 --> 01:05:17.190]  We could have put, these folks could have put up a bunch of, you know, supplements that are decent and quality, but that everybody else has.
[01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:22.030]  No, no, no. I've been working with them behind the scenes before all this launch for a good six months.
[01:05:22.389 --> 01:05:24.150]  And then it launched a few months ago, as you know.
[01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:28.150]  The first, well, they already had their own Super Greens up there.
[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.929]  That's even better than AG Greens, by the way, that's excellent.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.940]  But now they've got something that's a total game changer.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:38.820]  You've heard how great iodine is, the missing link, if it's atomic, actually from deep earth crystals.
[01:05:39.239 --> 01:05:41.300]  We're the only ones that have that X2, X3. They're amazing.
[01:05:41.639 --> 01:05:44.440]  It's essential in the body, meaning if you don't get iodine, you die.
[01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:46.929]  Alright? Look it up. It's essential.
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:49.230]  It's like vitamin C or oxygen or water.
[01:05:49.869 --> 01:05:51.449]  It's just how long do you die without it?
[01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.730]  Water three days. Oxygen four minutes.
[01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.750]  Food in a month. What's in food?
[01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.530]  The nutrients. But most foods played out.
[01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:01.610]  Now, fish is the only other great place to get atomic iodine.
[01:06:01.809 --> 01:06:03.710]  But a lot of times it's bound with mercury.
[01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:05.289]  This has no mercury in it.
[01:06:05.489 --> 01:06:08.349]  This is from a certain type of sea moss.
[01:06:09.989 --> 01:06:17.429]  That is the superfood that has pure atomic iodine connected to other crystal ring structures.
[01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.949]  Scientists aren't sure why it works so well.
[01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:26.239]  That delivers all these key trace elements and minerals and vitamins into the cells.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.420]  Ultimate CMOS at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.519]  They have a limited first run.
[01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:34.179]  You want to get it. It's 40% off out of the gates.
[01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:38.739]  CMOS has been all the rage for years, but this is the best CMOS you're going to get.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.960]  Private label from one of the top companies in the United States.
[01:06:42.409 --> 01:06:44.869]  Rich in nutrients, supports thyroid health.
[01:06:44.989 --> 01:06:51.730]  Sea moss is a natural source of iodine, which is essential to maintaining healthy thyroid function, helping regulate metabolism and hormone production.
[01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:54.610]  Essential in the body, all electrochemical activity, the brain.
[01:06:54.809 --> 01:07:04.349]  It's just amazing. Healthy digestion, boosts immune system, improves skin health, supports joint and muscle health, boosts energy levels, improves mental health.
[01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:08.409]  Now, some of the top green foods out there have a little bit of sea moss in them.
[01:07:09.969 --> 01:07:29.690]  These are gummies where they have a process where they're concentrated, so you get a huge dose of the CMOS. You want Ultimate CMOS at thealexjonesstore.com, and it's critical to this operation continuing on at full steam ahead one way or another at thealexjonesstore.com and realalexjones.com.
[01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:31.210]  Remember those URLs.
[01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:34.329]  If you're looking for us in the future, we get shut down.

[01:07:39.199 --> 01:07:40.300]  I want to thank all of our stations.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.699]  Be sure and support them as well.
[01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:47.860]  But the Ultimate CMOS, the new shirts, a lot of them are limited edition, like the Halloween ones.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:55.960]  It's all up there at thealexjonesstore.com and realalexjones.com.
[01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:57.139]  And you know who you are that donated.
[01:07:58.119 --> 01:08:00.460]  This is your chance, and you've taken action.
[01:08:00.739 --> 01:08:01.940]  I want to thank those that have.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.539]  You're the tip of the spear. You're the cream of the cream.
[01:08:08.139 --> 01:08:11.039]  And you're keeping freedom alive.
[01:08:11.219 --> 01:08:12.760]  And you stepped into history.
[01:08:13.639 --> 01:08:14.719]  And you're a game changer.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.479]  You're a man of action. You're women of action.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.560]  You're people of action. And you're investing in your own defense.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.810]  I will fight for you. Because I'm fighting for myself and my family and we're all in this together.
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:28.289]  But if you don't stand up for those that are fighting for you, you're crazy.
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:33.050]  So for those that just think this is entertainment or like the show and share it, that's great.
[01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:36.510]  But now is the time to come to the aid of your country and your own future.
[01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.670]  Now is the time to be the Paul Revere's.
[01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.890]  This is your chance and this is so important.
[01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:47.069]  RealAlexJones.com to donate or both TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:51.829]  Okay. Let me just do this.
[01:08:54.909 --> 01:08:56.050]  It's just too much news.
[01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:03.970]  Yeah, let me do this, because I meant to play this clip on Friday and didn't, and there's a new clip today I want to play.
[01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:14.130]  I want to play both these, and then I promise we're going to go to William, Ahmed, Sarah, Julie, Ed, Bart, Miss Lou, Carly, Michael, Henry, and others.
[01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.770]  I want to get these two clips out of the way, because they need to be heard.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.699]  And I'm trying to figure out the name.
[01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:27.920]  I know the name of the pastor, but I don't know the name of this black man who I saw on a podcast.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.060]  I post this on X, got millions of views.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.840]  I want him on the show.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.319]  So let's play that clip first, and then we'll play the pastor, preacher.
[01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:40.520]  The Democratic Party is anti-Christ, anti-family, and anti-black.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.720]  And both these guys just nail it.
[01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.640]  And I couldn't say it better than this guy.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.300]  And I can't say it more eloquently.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.020]  In fact, this guy has more...
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:57.100]  The truth is perfectly said, and he's got charisma.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.699]  And I see the talent out there.
[01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.500]  I'm seeing new people 20 times a day without me looking.
[01:10:02.859 --> 01:10:05.520]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, female, male.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.680]  And it just makes me feel so good.
[01:10:07.699 --> 01:10:12.279]  It's like you're on a football team, and all of a sudden some badass player joins the team that's like...
[01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:30.510]  Pat Brady or something, or all of a sudden Michael Jordan runs out on the basketball team, and it's like, so, and I just see this type of raw truth and nailing it, and it's scaring the globalists, folks.
[01:10:30.729 --> 01:10:32.229]  It's absolutely, and that's my job.
[01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.069]  It's always been to wake people up.
[01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:37.409]  What's crazy is so many times when I actually get these folks on, they say, hey, you woke me up.
[01:10:37.829 --> 01:10:39.069]  It's not about me getting the credit.
[01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:43.050]  It's about you realizing how much power you've got, and I keep harping on that.
[01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:48.550]  Here's a little example. Mike Judge had finished Beavis and Butthead.
[01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.789]  He also was over the F-18 fighter program.
[01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.130]  Total genius. 200 IQ. He's living in Austin.
[01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:58.470]  He's watching me on AXS TV in like 1996.
[01:11:01.899 --> 01:11:05.520]  And watching myself and a couple of my co-hosts, he comes up with the idea of King of the Hill.
[01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:06.739]  He's interviewed. I've interviewed him.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.340]  He said, I don't even know him. I'm interviewing him.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.800]  He goes, by the way, let me show you my archives.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:16.939]  Here's tapes of your show. You're Dale Gribble, but I didn't want it to be, you know, too slick, so I made him kind of have a speech impediment.
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.800]  Now, it's not about, oh, I'm Dale Gribble.
[01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:25.319]  I'm on AXS TV, been on air only two years in 96, and already Mike Judge, and then I'm Dale Gribble.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.079]  You don't know how influential you are.
[01:11:30.939 --> 01:11:32.600]  Like this black man. I don't know his name.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.500]  We're going to find it and get him on. Here it is.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.079]  The Democratic Party, I'm going to say it tonight.
[01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:40.920]  No, that's not it. Stop. I want the first guy in the podcast.
[01:11:42.779 --> 01:11:43.880]  That's the pastor.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.619]  It's the black guy on the podcast.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.779]  Play the podcast first.
[01:11:51.039 --> 01:11:52.479]  Racism doesn't have any power.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.979]  Chuck, I don't agree with that.
[01:11:54.199 --> 01:11:56.460]  People were outwardly racist while Trump was in office.
[01:11:56.699 --> 01:11:57.920]  He gave them...
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.479]  White people! He made it comfortable for people to be outwardly racist about how they fit.
[01:12:02.859 --> 01:12:05.260]  Chuck, the climate was a lot different.
[01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:16.220]  Studies came out about the racial divide trending in the wrong direction in 2013 when Barack Obama was entering his second term when the Black Lives Matter movement jumped off.
[01:12:26.699 --> 01:12:31.340]  We talk about one-way aggression.
[01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:36.840]  You allow to be openly racist towards one particular group of people, and it's white people.
[01:12:37.159 --> 01:12:38.880]  Let's call a spade a spade.
[01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.750]  White men are the issue.
[01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.609]  White men are the biggest threat to America.
[01:12:43.869 --> 01:12:50.569]  They are. You got analysts on MSNBC, CNN openly referring to Donald Trump and his voters as Nazis.
[01:12:50.789 --> 01:13:00.149]  Nowhere in popular media do you see white people saying the kinds of things that you see people saying about white people on national television.
[01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:04.270]  From Joy Reid, Trevor Noah, Don Lemon, over and over again.
[01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:05.890]  You don't see that anywhere else.
[01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:13.130]  Just because you can't get on mainstream media and make light of other races doesn't mean that the racial climate is still not what it is.
[01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:17.710]  The reason why the racial climate is what it is is because that's what critical race theory seeks to do.
[01:13:17.949 --> 01:13:23.310]  It seeks to polarize for the purpose of finding people who are sympathetic to your cause.
[01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:36.149]  And you keep on dividing one group onto itself until you create a group of disenchanted, angry, dysfunctional people that you can then use for the purpose of your liberation.
[01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.430]  That's not my words.
[01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:40.569]  Those are the words of Herbert Marcuse himself.
[01:13:41.029 --> 01:13:52.409]  Anybody talking about race in this country or talking about critical race theory and have never heard the writings of the words of Herbert Marcuse, you cannot sit at this table and talk because you don't know the theory, you don't know the science.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:59.060]  But like, somebody never heard of them, but in their own eyes, they look out into the world and think, yo, that shit is fishy to me.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.680]  I don't give a damn about what you go out in the world and see.
[01:14:01.819 --> 01:14:04.340]  A racial slur was spray-painted on the front gaze.
[01:14:04.859 --> 01:14:08.699]  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez is dealing with a racist and sexist.
[01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:10.699]  Found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace.
[01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:16.920]  See, this is all about narrative weaving and storytelling, because they play upon people's emotions and how they feel.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.500]  If I go to a doctor, I feel like I'm having a heart attack.
[01:14:21.659 --> 01:14:27.020]  The doctor is going to run a specific set of tests to get to what is actually happening.
[01:14:27.399 --> 01:14:28.600]  He has to know the truth.
[01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:33.779]  He can't do medical procedures upon me based upon what I tell him I feel.
[01:14:33.939 --> 01:14:35.479]  He has to know for a fact.
[01:14:35.579 --> 01:14:37.039]  He has to know what he's talking about.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.300]  So he has to do a battery test.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:43.600]  He has to do a test because if he does the wrong treatment to me based upon what I feel, he could kill me.
[01:14:45.659 --> 01:14:47.520]  All right, they found him. He's teach him Chuck.
[01:14:47.739 --> 01:14:49.279]  I want him on.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.720]  Woo! Nailing it.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.680]  And again, the CIA runs this.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:03.079]  They pay all these black hosts to literally say racist stuff about white people to make white people then hate black people and vice versa.
[01:15:03.239 --> 01:15:05.180]  And it's all, it was in the WikiLeaks.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.439]  Hillary's talking to the head psychologist over a major university and they say, we're losing the culture war.
[01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.119]  We got to go to total racial division.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.460]  And that's when this intensified.
[01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.329]  And it started under Obama.
[01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:21.850]  They want us divided while they destroy all of our futures and try to shoot us all up with poison shots.
[01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:26.930]  I mean, come on. Now, here's a black pastor laying it out.
[01:15:27.609 --> 01:15:32.210]  We're going to go to break and come back with a quick clip from the archive, 2016.
[01:15:32.489 --> 01:15:33.729]  And then I promise, caller, stay there.
[01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.510]  I love you. We got to get to all this.
[01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:36.630]  We're going to get to you at six after.
[01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.210]  I'm going to go right to all of you. Julie's first.
[01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:39.529]  Here's part of the black preacher.
[01:15:39.729 --> 01:15:42.510]  And in post, once we archive this, I'll put the whole clip in there, but it's long.
[01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:52.600]  Here it is. The Democratic Party, I'm going to say it tonight so that you won't be confused, is the anti-Christ party.
[01:15:53.079 --> 01:15:55.199]  It is anti-family.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.359]  And I'm going to say this, you're not going to believe it, but it is anti-black folk.
[01:16:01.529 --> 01:16:03.869]  You are only needed for votes.
[01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.270]  You are only loved when it's time to get your votes.
[01:16:07.989 --> 01:16:10.350]  There's no real care about you.
[01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:19.529]  And see, we still stuck and we got that thing ingrained in us that this is the party for the black man.
[01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.909]  It is not. The party has changed.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.640]  Black people, really, to be honest with you, have never been the priority.
[01:16:27.779 --> 01:16:29.260]  They have only been used.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.359]  Go back and look at the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
[01:16:34.319 --> 01:16:43.699]  We've all given Democrats credit for that, but Johnson was the one that wanted to pass it, but he couldn't get enough Democrat votes to pass it.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:50.340]  It was the Republicans that pushed And passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.680]  Go tonight and look it up.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.979]  Look at Wiki. W-I-K-I. Put it in there.
[01:16:55.539 --> 01:16:58.479]  He couldn't even get enough Democrats to vote for it.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.199]  So he had to go to Republican senators in order to help him out.
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.800]  They are anti-life.
[01:17:05.649 --> 01:17:08.510]  The party pushes stuff that's anti-life.
[01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:19.010]  It pushes anti-morality because most of their policies are immoral, that pushes sexual perversion.
[01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:21.689]  It is the party of death.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.500]  Why do you say that, Pastor?
[01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:28.420]  If you go back, you'll see slavery started with the Democratic Party.
[01:17:29.239 --> 01:17:31.920]  And we saw many slaves that died.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.300]  We also saw under Jim Crow.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.979]  Jim Crow was established by Democrats.
[01:17:37.439 --> 01:17:41.720]  And we saw under Jim Crow how many were hung and lynched.
[01:17:42.119 --> 01:17:58.789]  And then we're seeing today how many babies African-American people are giving up their future because they won't have, in another 15-20 years, they won't have enough people because they have cut their birth rates off and have aborted their children.
[01:17:58.989 --> 01:18:01.529]  This is exactly what the party wants.
[01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:06.609]  So it is a party of death when it comes down to it.
[01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:09.949]  It is a party that is against black families.
[01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:12.369]  Look at the history of the family.
[01:18:13.359 --> 01:18:22.159]  From slavery, which were Democrat plantation owners, in slavery they separated our families.
[01:18:22.479 --> 01:18:26.880]  They would not even acknowledge the marriages of black families.
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:37.260]  They would even take a black man over here who called himself being married to a woman, but if he was a big strong guy, they took him and made him mate with another woman.
[01:18:37.399 --> 01:18:47.000]  That's one of the reasons our marriages and our families have not been strong because the spirit of that has passed down generationally.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.800]  We have not always had strong family structures like we should have.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.500]  I gotta have this guy on. Find his name.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.140]  That's World Overcome Church.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.800]  Man. Man.
[01:18:59.239 --> 01:19:00.979]  I can't talk that good.
[01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:06.340]  We need to save InfoWars and go 24 hours a day.
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.229]  I'm not going to try to hire a black host.
[01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:11.609]  I'm going to try to hire whoever's the best.
[01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.569]  We might just end up with like 80% of the hosts being black.
[01:19:14.909 --> 01:19:17.210]  I'll hire all those black guys right now to host the show.
[01:19:17.289 --> 01:19:19.170]  I'm serious. Hell, I can retire!
[01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:30.729]  They can't stand the fact that we won't give up.
[01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:35.489]  And we're going to continue on to fight because our credibility has never been higher.
[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:37.689]  We've never reached more people.
[01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:42.390]  Thanks to you spreading the word and supporting the transmission.
[01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:44.390]  All right, the callers have been holding for 30 minutes.
[01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.270]  I appreciate them. We're talking about three big subjects.
[01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:54.090]  If you just joined us, election 2024, Trump 14 points ahead in major polls in Pennsylvania, surging in all the others.
[01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:55.449]  They're in full panic mode.
[01:19:55.609 --> 01:19:57.449]  The hurricane sabotage response.
[01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:06.869]  Axelrod and other Democrats admitting that the slow response to the mainly conservative counties, 24 of the 26, may never be able to even vote in the 28 days left.
[01:20:07.699 --> 01:20:08.979]  Early voting's already started.
[01:20:09.319 --> 01:20:11.439]  Gives them the smokescreen and chaos for fraud.
[01:20:12.319 --> 01:20:18.220]  And then the globalist attempts to shut down Infowars as early as...
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:21.000]  Well, the hearing's on the 17th, so they can do it by the 18th.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.319]  They're trying to shut us out at the state court level, ignoring the federal court.
[01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:25.720]  The federal court will probably slap it down.
[01:20:25.819 --> 01:20:28.800]  But, I mean, I've got to battle at every level.
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.239]  I've got to battle with lawyers at the state level and federal level.
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.039]  It's part of the fight. People go, it just goes on and on.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.979]  And we've survived so many attempts, just like Trump has.
[01:20:38.039 --> 01:20:39.279]  Attempts to take us off the air.
[01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:40.560]  It's a long fight.
[01:20:40.779 --> 01:20:41.880]  It's like a boxing match.
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.939]  It goes and goes.
[01:20:43.279 --> 01:20:45.840]  12 rounds, and we're now entering the 11th round.
[01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:49.359]  This is epic, and it's about stamina.
[01:20:49.359 --> 01:20:50.380]  It's about will.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.920]  It's about committing.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.760]  Let's go to Julie in Maryland.
[01:20:55.039 --> 01:20:56.340]  You're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.479]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.779]  It's me, Julie.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.500]  Welcome. Thank you.
[01:21:02.939 --> 01:21:04.939]  I'm calling about something.
[01:21:04.939 --> 01:21:08.710]  I want to talk to the audience about I don't...
[01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:10.710]  I'm prepared to beg.
[01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:19.409]  And I remember hearing you say less than 1% of the audience gives to Infowars, and I'm just stunned by that.
[01:21:19.489 --> 01:21:26.590]  And I just want to tell people I'm a 61-year-old woman, a single, solo.
[01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:29.489]  I help support Infowars.
[01:21:30.529 --> 01:21:34.609]  I just want to ask you, please, what better...
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:42.420]  Besides your small church, what better way to fight the globalists than one world order except to donate?
[01:21:42.819 --> 01:21:46.699]  Please donate to Alex Jones Infowars.
[01:21:47.359 --> 01:21:48.899]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.020]  Look, it comes down to this.
[01:21:51.119 --> 01:21:55.859]  No broadcast has had a bigger effect because of the crew and the guests and the listeners and the activists, okay?
[01:21:56.359 --> 01:21:57.399]  The enemy knows that.
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:02.180]  They say that because it's true. So it's not like I'm just up here saying, oh, I'm under attack.
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:07.699]  Oh, I need help. And they lied in the bankruptcy and in the news and said, Jones has hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.500]  Don't give you money. And the New York Times had to admit three months ago, turns out Jones had meager assets.
[01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:14.829]  And that's it.
[01:22:15.109 --> 01:22:16.229]  It was all lies.
[01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:20.050]  I sat there in these fake courts where I was already found guilty, and they said, he's got $300 million.
[01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:26.750]  He's got $400 million. He got it from these people that were raising money off me and lying about me and doing fundraisers off my name.
[01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:28.130]  Everything they said about me was them.
[01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:31.510]  Disgusting. Democrat Party PR firms, literally.
[01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:48.800]  Rigging it all. And so, yeah, they are hot and heavy to get me, and there's nowhere where you can support an operation that's having a bigger effect It's actually analyzing the enemy attack plan, and then what I break down gets picked up by everybody, and I'm very blessed, but that makes me a big enemy.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.859]  So yes, thank you for holding me up, keeping me up, holding the operation up.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.020]  You are literally the reason we're here.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.619]  And so every victory we have is your victory.
[01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:00.300]  You've invested in your future.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:04.739]  You've invested in freedom, and God sees what you're doing, keeping me in the fight.
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.539]  And then they're so pissed.
[01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:14.859]  They're all over the news, all over the corporate media, just completely USA Today, Washington Post, New York Times, just flipping out.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:24.880]  ADL, Southern Property Law Center, so pissed that you're keeping us on air, funding our appeals against these fake judgments, all of this, and they're just outraged.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.899]  So thank you so much. Anything else you'd like to add, Julie?
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.779]  Yeah, I would.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:36.239]  Alex, I'm doing my share, and I'm asking the listeners to please do your share.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.060]  I can't do it alone.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.420]  Thank you, Julie. Thank you, Julie.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.750]  Let me just say this. I'm the same way as listeners, so I don't want to blame people.
[01:23:45.409 --> 01:23:49.890]  I see, you know, pastors telling the truth, asking for support.
[01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:51.689]  And I'm like, well, somebody else will do it.
[01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:53.510]  Or other talk show hosts.
[01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:56.050]  And I'm just kind of like, well, I do my part.
[01:23:56.050 --> 01:24:01.250]  I spread the word. But then I've gotten over the years where I make a lot of donations myself because I realize it's that action.
[01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:03.750]  People just, and it's not work.
[01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:05.569]  It's fun. It feels good.
[01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:10.550]  It's the right thing to do to go to realalexjones.com, make a $5, $50, $10, whatever donation.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:19.279]  It is great to go to the alexshonestore.com and get a t-shirt or get this incredible CMOS that's got all these key nutrients in it, including the best type of iodine.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:28.439]  It's next level. And so it is a tiny fraction that ever go, well, you know, I'll just share the article, I'll share a video.
[01:24:28.579 --> 01:24:32.140]  It's a small percent through that. And they're the ones that actually take action.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.819]  So I'm not mad at folks that watch.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.960]  That don't make the final move to back what we're doing.
[01:24:39.859 --> 01:24:41.600]  It's always been like that.
[01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:46.079]  It was 1% start of the Revolutionary War, 4% that fought it and won it.
[01:24:47.199 --> 01:24:50.119]  And about, well they've got the numbers actually, historians do.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.680]  Over 40% did nothing and or worked with the Crown.
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:25:00.520]  Around 40% served the Crown and 40 plus percent Just sat out and did nothing.
[01:25:01.159 --> 01:25:03.460]  And then it was less than 5%.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.420]  Well, they call them 3%ers and all that.
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.920]  That's not just a motorcycle gang thing or a military thing or, you know, 1%ers, outlaw motorcycle gangs.
[01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:14.180]  The term is 3%er going back 250 years ago.
[01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:15.800]  It was about 3% were in the war.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.279]  And some numbers are 4% or 5%.
[01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.800]  But that's it.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.159]  So that's how it always has been.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:28.060]  So I want to think, you know, we should put a fundraiser T-shirt out that says...
[01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:44.529]  Something like, Second American Revolution, Three Percenter, Infowars, Defense League, or Alex Jones, Paul Revere Society, something like that.
[01:25:44.609 --> 01:25:48.069]  Because that's what it is. I mean, I thought we should have a t-shirt to educate people that says...
[01:25:48.899 --> 01:25:52.659]  You know, veteran of biological war of 2020-2024.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.340]  It's ongoing. I mean, we're all been in a bioweapon war now.
[01:25:56.539 --> 01:25:58.460]  A man-made virus and then the deadly response.
[01:25:58.619 --> 01:26:00.199]  I mean, people need to...
[01:26:00.199 --> 01:26:03.659]  The problem with conservatives and populists is not a problem.
[01:26:03.819 --> 01:26:08.859]  We get attacked, we just think of it as like something to get past and we move on and we're not victims.
[01:26:08.979 --> 01:26:17.680]  That's good. That's an attribute in our development that winners just, you know, get past the problem and don't dwell on it.
[01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:22.710]  Except... You've got to expose what the problem is so the same people that launched the bio-attack don't do it again.
[01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:28.229]  So, I mean, we're all veterans of a bio-weapon war.
[01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:35.189]  And there's been a coup where they had a medical emergency.
[01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:40.340]  Turns out It was actually Laura Loomer, of all people, that first broke.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:41.840]  There had been a medical emergency, and he disappeared.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.920]  And they said, no, it's not true. It was eight days.
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.220]  And then Charlie Kirk confirmed it with the Las Vegas police.
[01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:47.640]  And now it's all admitted.
[01:26:47.739 --> 01:26:51.699]  And they just put out a fake letter that he resigned and then just put her in.
[01:26:52.359 --> 01:26:58.960]  And, of course, he's wearing Trump hats now and, you know, speaking out basically against Kamala because he's pissed off.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.420]  But he stole it, too. So people are like, oh, Biden's good now.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.640]  You know, he's kind of doing stuff for Trump.
[01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.010]  They're crooks. He stole it, and then she stole it from him.
[01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:12.770]  That's how it works. You see third-world countries where they depose one president, and there's like five coups in one year.
[01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:14.569]  That's how this works.
[01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:19.029]  Or in the Roman Republic, declining into an empire, and there were lots of coups and stuff.
[01:27:19.449 --> 01:27:20.710]  I'm going to shut up and go back to your call.
[01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:22.250]  Sorry. I've got to hurry up here.
[01:27:22.909 --> 01:27:24.590]  Let's go to Ed in Alabama on the election.
[01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:27.189]  Ed, thanks for calling. Hey, Alex.
[01:27:27.329 --> 01:27:28.569]  Hey, it's great to be on.
[01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:33.409]  First, I just want to say to you and your team, Team Alex, right?
[01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:39.869]  Team Infowars. I just want to say to you guys, I've been listening for six months now, so I'm fairly new, registered independent.
[01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:45.750]  I just want to tell you, thanks for everything that you guys do in terms of informing all of us.
[01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:51.850]  Thank you for devoting your whole life, I mean, to this, a PhD in conspiracy, government conspiracy.
[01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:53.729]  So thank you for that, waking us all up.
[01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:54.989]  Thank you, brother Ray. Listen...
[01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:59.409]  I'm fighting for my future, and that means you've got to have a good future, too.
[01:27:59.670 --> 01:28:03.649]  That's what empathy is. So I do this because I don't want to be a slave.
[01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:05.850]  And of course, I have empathy, so I care about other people as well.
[01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:08.729]  I'm not a sociopath. But yeah, I'm not a hero, brother.
[01:28:08.890 --> 01:28:10.270]  I'm just doing what needs to be done.
[01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:13.369]  But we've been effective, so people need to bet on us.
[01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:14.550]  And I'm very thankful for your support.
[01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.149]  Go ahead. What's your view on the election?
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:31.220]  So with the election, the point I wanted to make was, number one, everyone out there, when you look at the mainstream news and they put those polls up there and they all seem extremely close, which is just irrational, right?
[01:28:31.359 --> 01:28:42.750]  I mean, the chances of a A whole state or a whole country to be one percentage or two percentage points apart is just mathematically not true, right?
[01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.090]  And so what I want to say is this.
[01:28:45.489 --> 01:28:58.010]  None of us should trust the polls at all because you cannot get an accurate polling even if you dreamed of an accurate polling methodology today.
[01:28:58.149 --> 01:29:02.369]  Because think about it. All of us, especially, and look, there are millions.
[01:29:02.619 --> 01:29:05.880]  I mean, there's millions of people listening to just your show, right, in this bubble.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.579]  But go outside of that.
[01:29:07.739 --> 01:29:13.659]  In today's society, if you were to call me on the phone, do you think I'm going to tell a stranger who I'm voting for?
[01:29:13.779 --> 01:29:15.939]  No, I'm not. And so they just move on.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:34.800]  The polling is not even close to being We're good to go.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.060]  We're good to go. We're good to go.
[01:29:38.079 --> 01:29:47.859]  We're good to go.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.340]  We're good to go.
[01:29:49.649 --> 01:29:50.670]  Everybody relax.
[01:29:51.189 --> 01:30:00.510]  I personally believe that Trump is, just like in 2016 when all of the polls were really off.
[01:30:00.609 --> 01:30:03.729]  Remember they were up to 20% off in the state.
[01:30:04.569 --> 01:30:06.369]  It's going to be the same thing again.
[01:30:06.529 --> 01:30:10.229]  Unless, again, we all know about the massive fraud that took place.
[01:30:10.409 --> 01:30:14.989]  If that takes place, then they're going to shrink that down like they did in 2020.
[01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:17.270]  And it'll look really close again, right?
[01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:18.750]  Where it's just a bare beat.
[01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:21.289]  But we know the raw truth.
[01:30:21.529 --> 01:30:24.029]  You said it, Alex, just today on your show.
[01:30:24.029 --> 01:30:25.989]  It's one of the only places I've actually heard.
[01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:27.409]  They don't say it on Fox News.
[01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:30.090]  They say the close polls.
[01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:32.729]  You said it truthfully.
[01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:34.550]  I'm with you.
[01:30:34.689 --> 01:30:37.390]  15% at least of a swing.
[01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:42.550]  And then the big cheat, when they put it on, it's going to close those numbers again and hopefully...
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:50.619]  Enough of us vote to overcome that cheat when they get ready to do it with false ballots or electronic voting and all of that.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.479]  Beautifully said. Thank you, Ed.
[01:30:52.819 --> 01:30:55.060]  And let me say something on this subject since you've raised it.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:04.800]  I have never come on air and told you that Trump is ahead when he's not, like the Democrats do, to create the perception and a bandwagon.
[01:31:05.239 --> 01:31:07.039]  Oh, wow, you know, Biden's ahead.
[01:31:07.039 --> 01:31:08.960]  He's going to win, and that creates somewhat of a bandwagon.
[01:31:09.159 --> 01:31:11.560]  Or Kamala's ahead, and it creates a bandwagon.
[01:31:11.739 --> 01:31:14.380]  And then Kamala tells crowds, hey, actually, it's very close.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.920]  You need to vote. Don't believe the polls.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.739]  Remember that in Atlanta. But what's happening is...
[01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.949]  Roger Stone is one of the smartest politicos out there.
[01:31:23.069 --> 01:31:24.390]  He looks at hundreds of polls a week.
[01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:26.850]  Trump won a landslide in 2016.
[01:31:27.130 --> 01:31:28.310]  They tried to steal it.
[01:31:28.949 --> 01:31:33.829]  And it wasn't a total landslide on election day because they mitigated a bunch of that with fraud.
[01:31:34.409 --> 01:31:36.189]  And again, they've got about 10% banked in with fraud.
[01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:38.250]  Different ways. That's what all the numbers show.
[01:31:38.829 --> 01:31:40.130]  Take an hour to go roll the evidence.
[01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:49.510]  Roger was telling me privately right before the 2020 election, he said, listen, he's barely ahead, and because of the fraud, he's going to lose.
[01:31:49.989 --> 01:31:56.710]  But he goes, you know, I don't know if I can tell you what he told me, but I pissed Trump off he said that publicly.
[01:31:57.590 --> 01:32:03.670]  But the point is, is that now the landslide's bigger than 2016, and that's why they tried to kill him twice.
[01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:09.520]  So, and again, Biden's a pedophile, a criminal, a horrible person.
[01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:13.699]  Closet KKK, it's all come out.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.119]  But, Judge Joe Brown's exposed that.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:22.100]  He actually worked around him and saw him when he was in Congress.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.000]  Biden, before he was in the Senate, 40 years ago.
[01:32:27.039 --> 01:32:32.210]  But, Biden is pissed because he's been removed from power and she's the president now.
[01:32:32.409 --> 01:32:34.710]  That's why he's criticizing her openly and wearing the hat.
[01:32:34.789 --> 01:32:36.989]  And I said two weeks ago when he wore the hat, I said, that's on purpose.
[01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:45.810]  Well, look at this. CNN even admits, Harris weighs more brakes with Biden as he keeps injecting himself in the campaign.
[01:32:46.409 --> 01:32:48.329]  And they admit he's out there undermining her.
[01:32:49.529 --> 01:32:52.430]  When she attacks his policies, he says, actually, she was in charge.
[01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:56.689]  Starts laughing. So to watch these criminals fight with each other is delicious.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.039]  Also, I've got this video.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.840]  I'm going to get to it later because I want to go back to your calls.
[01:33:02.939 --> 01:33:08.220]  But we've got the press secretary saying FEMA never gave any money to illegals, even though it's on record.
[01:33:08.659 --> 01:33:16.520]  We have her then admitting it, and we have all these mashups of CNN and other channels saying they're giving money to illegal aliens in the last few years.
[01:33:17.319 --> 01:33:18.939]  And then now they're saying they never said it.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:22.539]  I mean, it's just next-level lying, folks.
[01:33:23.159 --> 01:33:27.470]  Next-level lying. Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:29.189]  Let's go to Bart in Georgia.
[01:33:29.369 --> 01:33:30.569]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:38.229]  Yes, sir. First of all, I just wanted to tell everybody, I'm low income, but I gave $5 at realalexjones.com.
[01:33:38.289 --> 01:33:42.430]  Thank you. On all the listeners that are poor like me, give $5.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.239]  That's less than a pack of cigarettes I buy every day.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:51.880]  But anyway, shutting down Infowars is essential to globalists stealing this election.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.239]  It's like iodine in the body.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.800]  Trump needs Infowars or he's going to die.
[01:33:56.439 --> 01:33:58.579]  And they've got weather weapons hitting us.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.100]  They've got another one coming in, Milton, all this.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.920]  It's a full-court press on our freedom.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.539]  Thank you, Alex. Beautiful point.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.720]  I want to say something about what he just said.
[01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:14.550]  Somebody that doesn't have money given $1 is as important as somebody with a lot of money given $5,000.
[01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:16.369]  It's the widow's mite.
[01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:24.829]  And I really, quite frankly, don't want people that are on fixed incomes or having trouble donating to me.
[01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:29.869]  I'm serious. It's the middle class that the globalists are going to destroy.
[01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:33.069]  Supporting Infowars is insurance.
[01:34:33.529 --> 01:34:36.229]  It's like putting a coat on if you live in Minnesota in the middle of January.
[01:34:36.449 --> 01:34:39.289]  I mean, you're dumb if you don't. I mean, really, it's a no-brainer to back us.
[01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:43.130]  The globalists, your sworn enemies hate us more than anybody other than Trump?
[01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:46.310]  It's great. We've said donate to Trump, back Trump.
[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:52.109]  Total great. But Trump is doing well right now, and he still needs your support.
[01:34:53.609 --> 01:34:55.369]  I'm getting my ass beat to hell.
[01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:58.579]  So... And it's all in God's hands.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.779]  And people are starting to come through.
[01:34:59.899 --> 01:35:02.859]  But if people really come through, because I don't want to sit here every day and beg.
[01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:05.840]  Quite frankly, if I sit here every day and beg, we'll get the money we need.
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.840]  But I want to stay on target and be mainly focused on news, not having to focus on this.
[01:35:11.710 --> 01:35:13.930]  I mean, I haven't told you 10% of the crap goes on behind the scenes.
[01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:16.229]  Just keep me in the fight. Go get a great t-shirt.
[01:35:16.369 --> 01:35:17.609]  Go make a $10 donations.
[01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:26.329]  The AlexShownStore.com. Get the CMOS. I mean, folks, this is a special type of CMOS with these other key compounds that has iodine that goes right into your cells.
[01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:27.989]  A special combination.
[01:35:27.989 --> 01:35:29.189]  They don't know why it works so well.
[01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:31.510]  They have their theories. It's been the rage for years.
[01:35:31.630 --> 01:35:33.529]  And we've got one of the best brands out there, private labeled.
[01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:40.069]  And then it supports the broadcast. So if you love iodine, you're going to love the CMOS. Ultimate CMOS. The AlexShownStore.com.
[01:35:40.529 --> 01:35:41.569]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:47.369]  Thank you, Bart. Let's go ahead and talk to William in Arkansas, the Deep State 2024 election.
[01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:49.130]  Bart, or no, Bart just went.
[01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:50.289]  William in Arkansas, go ahead.
[01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:58.819]  I don't think the Deep State has anything more to do except Keep loading that weight on the camel's back, one straw at a time.
[01:35:58.979 --> 01:36:01.800]  That's the way I've been turning up the heat for a number of years.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.619]  It's great to talk to you again.
[01:36:03.619 --> 01:36:12.199]  I'm the knucklehead that talked to you a few months ago and reminded you I met you 30 years ago before you were ever on the air, and you gave me a book on John Birch.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:16.119]  I've got about 10 years on you, but I've been doing this my whole life, too.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:25.119]  I've often said in conversation to friends, you need to run some kind of 24-hour iPod like those two gentlemen you just had on moments ago.
[01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.680]  Hold on, I'm not going to cut you off.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.619]  I'm not going to cut you off, but my uncle...
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:45.560]  Even though he was very humble when he got out of the military and secret government operations, he said he wanted the most humble job he could, so he drove a bread route for Whatever the name of that company is.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.800]  Something Farms. And he lived in San Antonio.
[01:36:49.079 --> 01:36:58.260]  And he would take extra money he had and he would buy cases of the John Birch book, the history of the John Birch Society.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.899]  And I only had like two boxes he probably gave me when I was...
[01:37:04.419 --> 01:37:08.260]  I remember giving those away to people only a few times.
[01:37:08.359 --> 01:37:09.420]  I probably had 20 of those books.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.560]  That's very rare. It's crazy.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.500]  Where were you when I gave you this book?
[01:37:15.739 --> 01:37:16.779]  Outside of a courthouse.
[01:37:17.039 --> 01:37:27.560]  I came outside of a courthouse and you guys were chit-chatting about political stuff and I was kind of going off because I just saw some injustice in there.
[01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:30.649]  The gentleman you were with was trying to get me to shut up.
[01:37:30.829 --> 01:37:31.930]  I said, blah, blah, blah.
[01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:44.689]  You know, I'm sitting here dealing with a government that'll, you know, let Nazi and Japanese war criminals into this nation while I, as a soldier, you know, and others don't even get a good head start after fighting their diabolical wars.
[01:37:45.609 --> 01:37:48.930]  So, I mean, I've been—we're cut from the same cloth, brother.
[01:37:49.369 --> 01:37:50.989]  We need to keep you on the air.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:38:00.239]  There's been a lot of people out there, like you say, if you can't donate a little money, you're really not going to be putting up any blood, sweat, tears, or blisters or anything else when it comes to fighting.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.439]  They need to keep you on the air.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.600]  I'm doing all I can.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.840]  You know, God bless you for being out there, man.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.340]  I know there's other people who want to be on the air.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:12.020]  Hold on, I want to go back to what you first said, moving past me.
[01:38:12.739 --> 01:38:18.579]  You hit the key, something I don't talk about enough, and this weekend I was thinking, who was I with?
[01:38:21.539 --> 01:38:27.640]  I was with somebody this weekend or last week and I was with my Navy SEAL buddy.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.859]  We were working out.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:30.439]  He's helping me work out.
[01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:34.069]  And he said, look, it's simple what they're doing, Alex.
[01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:37.390]  They're trying to cause a revolution and pissing people off.
[01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:41.090]  They're doing all this stuff with FEMA stand downs and all of it, not just about stealing the election.
[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:43.090]  And they open borders and all this.
[01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:46.989]  They're trying to make people get violent because they know they're losing hearts and minds.
[01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:48.310]  And I think that's what you just said.
[01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.670]  They just keep putting pressure and pressure on.
[01:38:50.729 --> 01:38:52.890]  Is that what you were trying to say? Yes, sir.
[01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.449]  It's the weight on the camel's back.
[01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:59.949]  I mean, it's just like getting stuck in traffic when you're already behind the time, you know, of the day.
[01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:05.090]  They're trying to do that to the whole country, not only physically, but spiritually, intellectually, financially.
[01:39:05.369 --> 01:39:06.949]  It's like constipation, you know?
[01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:13.869]  One of the best things I ever got to do was I got to talk to you right before I was the last caller.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.199]  Right before your 30-year toast.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:20.840]  So I kind of feel special amongst all your millions of listeners and callers, man.
[01:39:20.899 --> 01:39:22.319]  It's one of the best things I ever got to do.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.180]  Well, God bless you, brother. Well, let me just...
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:25.340]  Thanks for the call. I'll say this right now.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.720]  I sit here before the show, especially lately, because we can be shut down, and it makes me have nostalgia and think about the crew and all we've done together.
[01:39:33.279 --> 01:39:34.659]  And it doesn't make me sad.
[01:39:34.979 --> 01:39:36.899]  It's like the Frank Sinatra song, My Way.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.239]  I forget the exact words where...
[01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.930]  He thinks about the bad things that have happened and then it just becomes sweet.
[01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:45.430]  It makes him laugh.
[01:39:45.609 --> 01:39:50.369]  In fact, I want to come in next segment with Frank Sinatra's My Way from the start.
[01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:56.090]  I'm going to play it and analyze it and give you my view and then I'll go right back to your calls.
[01:39:56.229 --> 01:40:08.300]  But when I think about what we've done together and I think about the experiences and the adventures and all the things we've done and the people I got to meet, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[01:40:08.699 --> 01:40:14.340]  And they try to act like I'm a loser because I'm demonized or you're a loser because you love freedom or Trump's bad and is a loser.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.239]  No, we're not. We're people that love God.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.840]  We're trying to do the best job we can.
[01:40:19.559 --> 01:40:25.199]  And when I'm out in public and I run into black people or white people or Hispanic people, look, I'm white.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:26.859]  I'm tired of being demonized and being attacked.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.359]  And there are racist people in the line because of what color I am.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.159]  But they've been manipulated and brainwashed by the globalists.
[01:40:32.619 --> 01:40:41.279]  When I look at the sweet black families and the brown families and the white families and I see the light in their eyes, it's the light of God in them.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:47.659]  And so that's why I can't get sucked into hating people as a group, even though a lot of them have been trained to hate me.
[01:40:47.859 --> 01:40:49.300]  There are a lot of good folks in those groups.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.000]  And God wants us all to come together and beat this thing.
[01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:55.279]  Now, God wants us to stand up for what group we are.
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:58.520]  God made many tribes and has different plans for all of us in different ways.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.659]  But this is all God's plan.
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.819]  God made all these groups, all these people for a reason.
[01:41:03.119 --> 01:41:07.220]  And I just love the children, whether they're little black kids or little white kids or whatever they are.
[01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:10.260]  They deserve freedom and they deserve us to stand up for them.
[01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:13.069]  And I think about all we've been through.
[01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:20.130]  So when I thank you, I've got so much emotion in it and so much thought, it just seems empty because it's not enough.
[01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:25.409]  I am so appreciative of all you keep me on the air.
[01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:26.670]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.439]  That's why they get on the TV, these Democrat lawyers, and say, don't support him.
[01:41:30.659 --> 01:41:32.920]  He's going down. Your investment ain't gonna work.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:37.500]  They're liars. All your investment in time and energy and money has done is paid off.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.680]  And that's not me. That's God working through us.
[01:41:39.979 --> 01:41:44.800]  So I think about how much we've gotten done, and I'm like, hell, I can't take a back seat.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:49.680]  Even though, you know, they're gunning for me more ways than one.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.979]  I gotta turn it up.
[01:41:51.239 --> 01:41:52.699]  And that's why you've got my commitment.
[01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:57.000]  I am turning it up. And I ask God to give me the energy to turn it up.
[01:41:57.979 --> 01:41:59.220]  And I ask you to keep me in the fight.
[01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:02.550]  God bless you. I'll be right back. Hi, I'm Kamala Harris.
[01:42:03.090 --> 01:42:12.029]  When I'm elected president, platforms that promote free speech, truth, and resilience to the New World Order, like TheAlexJonesStore.com, will be banned.
[01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:17.250]  Sites that profit off dangerous truths are a threat to our democracy.
[01:42:17.649 --> 01:42:26.430]  Shirts sold at TheAlexJonesStore.com, like the InfoWars limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, will no longer be tolerated.
[01:42:26.649 --> 01:42:27.670]  And let's be clear.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.880]  If you're caught wearing one of these shirts, you will face arrest.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:42.779]  Whether it's the Alex Jones for President 2028 shirt or any other merchandise pushing harmful messages of patriotism, family, faith and freedom, this kind of propaganda has no place in our future.
[01:42:43.079 --> 01:42:46.899]  We will create a future where safety, censorship and tyranny prevail.
[01:42:47.369 --> 01:42:53.449]  Don't go to thealexjonesstore.com to purchase products that keep Alex Jones on the air.
[01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:56.350]  Don't wear the shirts or support humanity.
[01:42:56.529 --> 01:43:00.289]  If you do, you'll be the first in line for my depopulation agenda.
[01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:07.770]  I got a whole stack of reports on weather weapons and what's really going on and I'm going to wait until tomorrow.
[01:43:08.029 --> 01:43:10.250]  I'm going to shoot a special report on this today.
[01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:18.890]  I got congressional reports and other stuff I want to get, and then I'm going to do it justice tomorrow and the next day because people are ready to hear the truth on this.
[01:43:19.529 --> 01:43:20.810]  Let's jam in some more phone calls.
[01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:22.770]  Barry in California, thanks for calling.
[01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:25.550]  Go ahead. Hey, can you hear me okay, Alex?
[01:43:25.649 --> 01:43:31.090]  Yes, I can. Go ahead. Yes, I've been awake since 2009.
[01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:33.210]  I started listening to you in 2009.
[01:43:33.949 --> 01:43:38.930]  Retired military here in California where tyranny is rampant.
[01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:42.729]  But... There's two people you guys need to check out.
[01:43:43.569 --> 01:43:57.149]  CoachJV, at CoachJV on X. And he's talking about between October 6th through the 15th, there's going to be all kinds of distractions that are going to freak us out.
[01:43:57.289 --> 01:44:00.029]  And then there's another one, Jessica Rojas.
[01:44:00.529 --> 01:44:01.729]  She's cat.
[01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:09.630]  Cat. Something cat for me.
[01:44:11.769 --> 01:44:28.520]  And she said she has a high-level person in her family and the military and said to get her stuff ready since April and that there's going to be not a civil war but Yeah,
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.659]  well, I don't know who those people are, and I'm sure they're great.
[01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:34.859]  The Democrats say they're going to have civil war conditions.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.560]  They say they're going to overthrow the country.
[01:44:36.939 --> 01:44:44.340]  I played the clips. And people never liked the actual clips of Hillary saying, man, the First Amendment, or they're going to have a civil war, they're going to arrest all of us.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.800]  It's like, oh, they admitted it.
[01:44:46.039 --> 01:44:47.420]  Everybody's like, oh, I don't care if it's admitted.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.199]  And then it's like, if it's a rumor, though, everybody loves it.
[01:44:50.239 --> 01:44:51.600]  It's like, oh, my God, I heard a rumor.
[01:44:51.939 --> 01:44:53.199]  And I'm not putting those people down.
[01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:56.920]  I'm not putting you down. I'm just saying they've already appointed Kamala.
[01:44:57.039 --> 01:44:59.119]  She didn't get one vote. They removed Biden.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.380]  So, yeah, we're already under a coup.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.699]  Yeah, we're in.
[01:45:02.859 --> 01:45:04.720]  They already tried to kill Trump twice, brother.
[01:45:05.819 --> 01:45:09.359]  Yeah. Yeah, and so are you still there?
[01:45:09.579 --> 01:45:20.909]  Yep, sure am. Yeah, so my main thing for Cohen is No matter what happens, no matter if they cheat, if God wants Trump to be president, he'll be president.
[01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:23.130]  The problem is the church.
[01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:28.470]  When I mean by the church, the church in America needs to wake up.
[01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:31.050]  We have a right to vote.
[01:45:31.210 --> 01:45:33.949]  God gave us that right to vote, and we need to.
[01:45:34.069 --> 01:45:36.430]  I go to Calvary Chapel, Chino Hills.
[01:45:39.069 --> 01:45:40.890]  Jack Hibbs is our pastor.
[01:45:41.439 --> 01:45:44.699]  And we stayed open during COVID. That's good.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.020]  That's good. I got to jump, brother.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.779]  Thank you. Now, Joe Salente is the top trends forecaster.
[01:45:48.899 --> 01:45:53.430]  He always kicks ass. He's about to take over, but I promised I would get to your call.
[01:45:53.529 --> 01:45:56.770]  So when I come back, I'm giving each caller, because I want to hear from you, a minute and a half.
[01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:58.770]  We're only going to take four of them. All right?
[01:45:59.569 --> 01:46:05.109]  We're going to go Miss Lou, Carol, that's my mom's name, Jeff, and Alexandra.
[01:46:05.409 --> 01:46:14.289]  I'm going to go right to you, and then I'm going to hand the baton to Gerald Slytherin, who's got a ton to cover, and then Owen Troyer in 57 minutes, the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:46:14.289 --> 01:46:15.890]  And these could be the last InfoWars shows.
[01:46:16.890 --> 01:46:20.970]  If the bad guys buy it on November 13th, they've got a plan to shut us down very, very quickly.
[01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:28.109]  And on the 17th, or the 17th, they're having a hearing in Austin trying to take over the company at the state level.
[01:46:28.529 --> 01:46:31.250]  And we keep surviving, and people go, oh, is this real?
[01:46:31.409 --> 01:46:32.470]  You just watch.
[01:46:32.710 --> 01:46:36.850]  Of course it's real. So I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you again.
[01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:41.729]  Whatever happens to InfoWars, regardless, support our sponsors, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:41.829 --> 01:46:43.890]  That supports InfoWars and going forward regardless.
[01:46:44.489 --> 01:46:46.369]  Thealexjonesstore.com, a lot of new t-shirts up there.
[01:46:47.569 --> 01:46:49.170]  This new superfood is incredible.
[01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:50.750]  The sea moss.
[01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:52.850]  It's next level with the iodine and more.
[01:46:53.409 --> 01:46:56.770]  And then, of course, we've got straight donations for legal defense that I absolutely have to have.
[01:46:56.869 --> 01:46:59.430]  I want to thank those that have supported. RealAlexJones.com.
[01:46:59.689 --> 01:47:01.930]  RealAlexJones.com. Those are the coordinates of action.
[01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:05.329]  Thank you for your support. TheAlexJonesStore.com and RealAlexJones.com.
