[00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:27.129]  It's Tuesday, December 10th, 2024, and the globalists have officially launched three new plandemics to bring us to heel.
[00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:30.829]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.590]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:45.710]  It is Tuesday, December 10th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled InfoWars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.869]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you can set your watch by it, you can mark your calendar by it, and we did ad nauseum.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:19.140]  I told you over and over and over and over again that there were four main tracks and some sub-tracks the globalists had openly prepared and even admitted in public statements they were going to use to maintain control over humanity and bring in their global cashless society AI slave grid completely.
[00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.739]  The social credit score nightmare.
[00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.159]  And of course, that's expansion of war and destabilization.
[00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.120]  We're already in World War III. General Flynn agreed with me yesterday that's the case.
[00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:44.079]  It is racial balkanization and division to try to drive Trump from office if he gets in in 40 days.
[00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.519]  It is a new group of pandemics or viral pandemics.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.180]  Hysteria.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.500]  That's now officially...
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.700]  You can put a fork in it today.
[00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.459]  They're going with it.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.959]  It's happening.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.260]  That was very clear already, but now they've officially said it's going down.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.700]  New lockdowns, total hysteria.
[00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.079]  They're saying it's going to be way worse than COVID. I mean, wait till I get to it.
[00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.500]  And then you've got economic collapse that's mixed into all of that.
[00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.479]  Big cyber attacks they can blame on the Russians.
[00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.719]  They've also got drones everywhere.
[00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.240]  They're obviously human-run, harassing everybody, and then the media's implying it's aliens.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.139]  They're doing it in Europe, the UK, Australia, the US, Canada.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.460]  It's a globalist operation.
[00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.219]  I guess that's a fifth track, Project Blue Beam, fake alien invasion.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.280]  It is quite a time to be alive right now.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.520]  And of course we have Henry Kissinger and even Ronald Reagan saying we could use an alien threat to unify the planet.
[00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.800]  Well, do they mean unify that around the globalist agenda?
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.979]  Currently.
[00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.699]  So, we've got one hell of a broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:14.990]  Then we've also got the fact that the judge had an evidentiary hearing yesterday in Houston about whether Michael Bloomberg's Everytown group that's now come out in court, financed, and runs the attempted takeover of InfoWars is The Onion as its front group.
[00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.849]  And their clearly fraudulent fake auction for the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department that was given to them and the bigger bid excluded.
[00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.729]  And they admit they want me off the air.
[00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.370]  That's been extended to today.
[00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:45.060]  And so, where they're waiting for that shoe to drop, The ex-lawyers also spent the first hour of the hearing yesterday explaining that they're not going to give the Alex Jones handle or any of the handles to the bad guys.
[00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.759]  But they went on to say, but we have no say in Jones's content.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.240]  That's separate from us.
[00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.500]  People said, well, they're not defending you.
[00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.780]  X doesn't have jurisdiction over my content.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.740]  And these people don't either, because I'm not like Prince where I got a record deal.
[00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.759]  It's my persona.
[00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.539]  It's my will.
[00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.400]  It's my words.
[00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.569]  It's 13th Amendment against slavery.
[00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.169]  They cannot ever own that.
[00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.169]  But they're going to try.
[00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.030]  That'll affect all of you as the president said in case.
[00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.669]  Stay with us.
[00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:30.670]  It is Tuesday, December 10th, 2024. I come to you from the very front lines of more than just the information war, but the very battle for the future destiny of humanity.
[00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.470]  All right.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.379]  It is now official on every front.
[00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:47.139]  The globalists are trying to trigger a race war in America as the cover for a coup against President Trump and mass uprisings.
[00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.939]  That's official.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.319]  I've been telling you for years that if Trump could retake the White House, that was one of their main plans because they had publicly prepared it.
[00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:58.029]  Now we're here.
[00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:03.410]  And they're using the Daniel Penning case to say burn down the country, kill all the white people.
[00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.230]  That is a tiny minority, a brainwash leftist black people on the Soros payroll.
[00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.990]  So they've got that heated up in case they can't kill Trump before he gets into office.
[00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.269]  That'll be one of the big challenges they throw at him there.
[00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:27.069]  We've got all of that information and we'll be hitting that Coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.089]  But that's off 40 days from now.
[00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.930]  They're just getting it warmed up and ready to serve.
[00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.730]  Right on time.
[00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:43.189]  And they're going to have, again, massive terror attack on a black college or a black gathering, black grocery store, something like that, black church.
[00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.449]  And migrants will be attacked as soon as Trump gets in, guaranteed, 100%.
[00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:48.970]  That's done.
[00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.209]  That's going down.
[00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.589]  Unless Trump speaks about it and we get ahead of it and see the move.
[00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:07.709]  As I predicted in the last three years, that as soon as Trump got re-elected, if he could, if we overrode the fraud, the big enough landslide, that NATO would start bombing inside Russia.
[00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:19.589]  I would name the missiles, attack them, storm shadows, and others, which normally are nuclear tipped, but they would do conventional to try to get Russia to overreact because they don't know when those missiles are coming in whether they're nuclear tipped or not.
[00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.699]  They started bombing Russia three weeks ago with it.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:34.040]  Russia tested an intermediate ballistic ICBM nuclear-capable multiple warhead delivery system and said, you're in check.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.839]  So they haven't done that since then because Russia threatened to start nuking.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.600]  If they did any more, globalists may still do it at any moment now.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.360]  That's how crazy they are in the next 40 days.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:53.829]  But you've seen Syria overthrown, shibble war in Syria, Georgia, and I'm not talking about Georgia peaches in the South.
[00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.110]  I'm talking about Georgia and Southern Europe.
[00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.050]  Then you've got Romanian election canceled after a Patriot won.
[00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.410]  It was anti-war, anti-globalist.
[00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:16.810]  NATO now set up a dictatorship there and is set to obviously have some provocation between Romania and Russia as the pretext to declare Article 5 and bring NATO directly into the war.
[00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:30.800]  You have Netanyahu on Sunday in the Golan Heights, the Israeli Prime Minister, Saying, oh, don't worry, we're just going in five miles for a little while.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.500]  We're going to leave.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.040]  We're just getting a security perimeter.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:42.079]  Now they've gone 16 miles in at least, only 20 miles from the capital of Syria, the oldest country in the world.
[00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:52.129]  Netanyahu has now said, quote, the Golan mountain range is, quote, ours forever.
[00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.670]  So this will obviously continue.
[00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.509]  It looks like Israel is going to take at least half of Syria.
[00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:01.629]  I predicted this days ago.
[00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.529]  It wasn't hard to predict.
[00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:06.009]  It's like the five armies battle in The Hobbit.
[00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:25.990]  Now, Erdogan, the dictator of Turkey, I mean, they have elections, but he's an admitted dictator, largest conventional military in Europe, member of NATO, is now threatening war with Israel if they don't basically leave Syria.
[00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.889]  And he's saying it's his.
[00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:35.429]  And of course, Turkey's going to take a large sector, but they say that should be part of Turkey, going back to the Ottoman Empire.
[00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.350]  So you've got, like, Hitler and Stalin...
[00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:43.370]  You can choose which is Hitler, which is Stalin, but that's the historic perspective.
[00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.990]  I'm not saying the politics are exactly the same.
[00:08:45.169 --> 00:08:49.690]  But you got Israel, and you got Turkey now.
[00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:56.830]  Okay, they're dividing a country up, and now they're eyeing each other and threatening each other, and that's how these things just cascade and escalate.
[00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:01.850]  I would imagine you're going to see a false flag attack on Poland, probably.
[00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:11.769]  Because Zelensky already got caught doing that two years ago, but it came out that it was his missile, so Russia didn't get officially attacked by NATO yet.
[00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.570]  Now they are.
[00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:14.649]  But not for that pretext.
[00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:21.210]  NATO even blew up the North Stream pipeline, tried to use that as a pretext to attack Russia, saying they did it.
[00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.250]  Now it's admitted NATO did it.
[00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:23.450]  Really, the U.S. did it.
[00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:38.210]  And I would imagine a bunch of other countries will suddenly be overthrown by NATO. Where NATO has a presence, but now they'll officially overthrow them to further antagonize and poke the bear, as they say.
[00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:56.509]  So you got a whole bunch of intelligence heads and generals on all sides say, yeah, World War III We're good to go.
[00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:19.870]  And he said, yeah, I would imagine that NATO will overthrow Romania, and then Israel and others, Turkey, will go into Syria.
[00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:23.990]  Of course, he died right after he came back from Ukraine.
[00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.370]  He had a 24-hour cancer.
[00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:26.990]  Very suspicious.
[00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.110]  Those are very fast-acting, aren't they?
[00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.370]  So, there is just a lot of craziness.
[00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:41.129]  Going on so crazy.
[00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.350]  I mean, I just really had trouble grasping it myself.
[00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:52.950]  And then, of course, you've got hundreds of incidences a week in every Western country.
[00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.470]  That's when you know it's Western countries and it's human.
[00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.769]  You can look at them and see it is.
[00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:14.059]  And you'll see hundreds or dozens or sometimes thousands of drones, some large, some small, Just harassing military bases, ports, naval ships, government buildings, and you can see they're human drones,
[00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:22.659]  and then the media acts like it's aliens, and they'll do a bunch of light shows and things and get together in a group like a big flying saucer, and you can see it's drones.
[00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:33.309]  In China, they have hundreds and sometimes thousands of drones, and they have dragons flying around in the air, big soldiers walking, a thousand foot tall soldiers.
[00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.190]  That's the image, the illusion they make.
[00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:38.850]  You'll see blue whales swimming around in the sky.
[00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:43.049]  So China just shows them, oh, here's a thousand drones flying in unison.
[00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.409]  Here it's, oh my God, what is it?
[00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.149]  And then everyone marbles and just keeps asking, what are these hundred drones that flew over...
[00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:54.389]  San Antonio last night.
[00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:55.090]  Ooh, what's that?
[00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.509]  Looks like a flying saucer.
[00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.289]  And anybody can look at it and see that it's a bunch of drones in unison doing a live show.
[00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.610]  But that's the PSYOP we live under.
[00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:08.870]  And they already had the PSYOP that you're all going to die if you don't take this shot.
[00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.649]  Then the shot erases your immune system and then causes at least 30 million people to die.
[00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.809]  So if they'll do that, they'll do anything.
[00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:26.590]  And so our government, the corporations that have hijacked it and run it, Had brought us into World War III. It's happening now.
[00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.309]  And the general public still is basically unaware that that's even happening.
[00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:32.610]  The only question is, will it go nuclear?
[00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.090]  How bad will it escalate?
[00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.909]  Or can the brakes be put on, as Trump's trying to do, valiantly, sanely.
[00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:46.610]  And you got the UFO blue beam is now being soft deployed.
[00:12:47.029 --> 00:12:48.309]  That's a fake alien invasion.
[00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:49.970]  So they're soft deploying nuclear.
[00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.029]  Well, it's really a strong deployment, but they're not saying the aliens are attacking us yet.
[00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:57.149]  That would be the official Blue Beam deployment.
[00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:00.789]  That shelved U.S. government plan for a fake alien invasion.
[00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.549]  So Blue Beam is now being rolled out, being beta tested publicly.
[00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.190]  Well, it's beyond beta.
[00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:07.289]  It's a soft launch.
[00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:09.250]  So there's a soft launch of Blue Beam.
[00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.250]  World War III is now officially, we're in it.
[00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.590]  We're living in it right now.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.700]  We're good to go.
[00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:34.009]  So we're in a new multiple-plandemic hysteria launch, World War III, Blue Beam soft launch.
[00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:38.429]  They're doing the soft launch of the race war cover.
[00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:44.830]  If Trump gets in in 40 days, as the Democrats have officially said they will do, they will then hype up racial division.
[00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:52.909]  They will then demonize Trump for arresting illegals and human traffickers and drug dealers and deporting them.
[00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:58.500]  And then they've said Trump's going to kill the migrants and the black people with no evidence.
[00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:03.299]  Obviously they're going to add the final ingredient of a false flag or false flags.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.940]  And then have the Democrat states and cities secede, say that he's not the president.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:16.120]  When he tries to call it the military constitutionally, they will declare it unconstitutional, as the Pentagon already says it's unconstitutional for him to use the military domestically.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.580]  When that's not true, when they're aiding local law enforcement or the Border Patrol in taking out aliens under the law, it's in the Constitution.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.919]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:26.799]  I mean, it's in the Declaration of Independence, for God's sakes.
[00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.139]  Heaven's sakes.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.179]  So that's an official plan.
[00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:41.950]  So they've got the race war as the cover for civil unrest, martial law, political coup against Trump, because he's a Nazi and all supporters are Nazis.
[00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.570]  So that's going hot.
[00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.610]  That's going live.
[00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.269]  Like you flip a switch with the Soros Fund of Black Lives Matter saying kill the white people and all the rest of it.
[00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.289]  We've got those clips coming up.
[00:14:52.129 --> 00:15:05.379]  So they're doing the prep and the pre-launch Rollout of the race-based civil war.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.980]  Totally synthetic, run by the globalists, CIA, think tanks.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.519]  They got the World War III. They got the alien rollout.
[00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:16.179]  They got the viral rollout.
[00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.240]  They can do the economic collapse.
[00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:25.139]  They can do a giant cyber attack and blame on whoever they want and knock the power out.
[00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:44.039]  And if people aren't aware that the globalists aren't going to go quietly, There are big financial bubbles coming to an end and they need to launch their new global cashless society system to be the cover for the collapse of the old system and then bring in total control.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.960]  I mean, that's where we are.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.840]  And I'm just here absolutely 100% nailing what they're doing.
[00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:58.220]  Told you years ago, months ago, that this would happen once Trump was president-elect in this scenario if we overrode the fraud.
[00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:05.450]  With a big enough mega landslide, which we had the biggest probably ever in U.S. history, so it was just a moderate landslide because of the fraud.
[00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.149]  So again, there's a fraud blue seawall, and here comes in the Trump wave.
[00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:12.870]  If it isn't ultra-massive, it can't make it over.
[00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:18.769]  It's just a mathematical breakdown, and you have to go through all the numbers, but we've explained that in detail before, so I'm not going to rehash that.
[00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:29.850]  So in the scenario of him becoming president-elect, World War III, new pandemic hysteria, Nazis attack the brown people.
[00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:30.970]  It's all Trump's fault.
[00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:39.769]  So that's the cover for the Democrat states to secede and trigger a civil war and try to drive Trump from power, or at least squat and sit over their political zones.
[00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.009]  The alien fake invasion.
[00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:53.470]  And they've got all these programs rolling out right now in different degrees of their launch.
[00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.649]  The World War III is the most advanced.
[00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:57.870]  We're actually in it.
[00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:02.149]  So it's the most dangerous in my view.
[00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:09.369]  And then you've got the new viral hysteria that I'm going to hit first in detail that is number two.
[00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:10.869]  They're definitely launched that.
[00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.309]  The question is, what's the permutations?
[00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:14.710]  Exactly what are they going to pull?
[00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.609]  Really depends on how scared we get.
[00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.549]  Do we buy into it?
[00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.869]  It's a bunch of kabuki theater.
[00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.849]  There'll be some real deaths in and around it.
[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.609]  I'll explain that.
[00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:37.589]  And then you've got the civil unrest martial law operation, debt dated under the cover of racial division, that'll be false flag triggered.
[00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.509]  Then you've got the alien card, and that could be the number one card.
[00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:57.819]  I don't know if they're really going to do aliens start attacking quite yet, but when all the secret technology and all the drones and advanced stuff, obviously it's weaponized, they've got Guys in alien suits,
[00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:00.220]  they've got robots that look like aliens.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.099]  The word is, and we know they actually have these questions of will they deploy They've got replicants.
[00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:08.500]  They've got biological androids.
[00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:12.180]  They've dolled up to be actually genetically pretty freaky looking.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.240]  They just have these guys.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.440]  I mean, it could be a biological android too with a robot control chip.
[00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:21.079]  A couple of those lands shoot a bunch of people with laser guns.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.380]  I mean, it's total hysteria everywhere forever.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.559]  You've got to have one ship land, ten aliens get off.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.579]  Of course, they're not aliens.
[00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:30.940]  I mean, it's alien from anything that's ever lived on this planet, but they're making these things.
[00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:36.119]  I mean, they've had human cloning for 80 years at least on record.
[00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:42.500]  Human-animal hybrids for 50. Of course, I told you about that 30 years ago.
[00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:43.160]  It was in the literature.
[00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:44.059]  It was in the documents.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.299]  Scientific literature.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.579]  But now it's just, oh yeah, there's labs all over the country and all over the world with human-animal hybrids, but we're not going to show them to you.
[00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:53.740]  MIT quarterly, 10 years ago.
[00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:58.460]  So, we are in the greatest time of change ever.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.259]  Everybody's been prepped for this by Hollywood.
[00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:08.210]  And it's just an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.109]  That's really where we're at.
[00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:27.349]  Because the globalists knew people were going to resist having your sons and daughters taken away, having them sterilized, having open borders, having your jobs taken away, having everything go to robots, banning most farming, starving people to death, cutting off your resources.
[00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.670]  I mean, they knew and they said there'd be opposition.
[00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.630]  So it's public documents.
[00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.750]  Well, we'll do a fake alien invasion or we'll start World War III or...
[00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:42.799]  And then they settled on, we'll use a virus, disease X, going back 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 14 years ago.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.920]  That's why you see these reports I did 14, 15, 16, 20, 25 years ago.
[00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:58.839]  And I'm sitting there, younger Alex Jones saying, and they'll make you wear a mask and six foot separation and lock everything down and then bring on a global ID card and they'll track everywhere you go with it.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.109]  They want to train you to be locked in your house unless you're told you can leave by your Smartphone.
[00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.450]  And people then look 20 years later and they go, how the hell did he nail it?
[00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.170]  I didn't nail anything.
[00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:17.069]  It's in documents like the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep with John Hopkins.
[00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.529]  All you gotta do is go read it.
[00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.769]  That's what I did.
[00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:24.049]  On air.
[00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.130]  So I wasn't predicting anything.
[00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.869]  I was telling you their plan.
[00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.349]  And that's really what I'm frustrated by.
[00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.430]  Is I've told you step by step their plans.
[00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.690]  That you can see when they're getting ready to roll one out because they prep it.
[00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:42.589]  And I'm sitting here.
[00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.849]  It'd be like when Ford's coming out with a new car.
[00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:52.829]  And for six months they run an ad for the car.
[00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:59.599]  And then they had the car, you know, show up at an NFL game during halftime and somebody talked about the car.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.500]  And somebody says, how do you know they're coming out with a new car brand or a new car name?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.140]  I'm like, well, you see the TV ads, right?
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.839]  Or back in the 80s, it was a big deal when Coca-Cola would bring out a new, oh, it's Diet Coke.
[00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.039]  Oh, it's Cherry Coke.
[00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.000]  Oh, it's New Coke.
[00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:15.059]  Oh, it's Classic Coke.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.119]  Oh, it's, I mean, how would I know they're coming out with Cherry Coke in 1984 or whatever it was?
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.220]  They had wall-to-wall ads for Cherry Coke.
[00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:38.299]  So, you know, they had all these movies and TV shows about civil war and a Trump character that's racist and the military joins with the brown people to march on D.C. and kill Trump inside the White House.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.519]  I mean, that was their plan in 2020. They said, if he wins, we'll just have a civil war.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:52.839]  We believe the military leadership will join with us and we'll have cover stories of why the general public should do it and we'll have a civil war.
[00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:59.789]  And then they were able to steal it in 2020, so they said, okay, well, we'll shelve that.
[00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.529]  And then they started saying right before this election, well, we'll go back to that plan.
[00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.150]  And Carmel said, we'll have an uprising.
[00:22:06.329 --> 00:22:07.750]  Black people need to kill the white people.
[00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.210]  Said it on MSNBC. A bunch of them said it.
[00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.769]  I said, well, they'll start hyping up events that happen, like a cop doing something wrong, or Daniel Penny if he gets off.
[00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:32.789]  I said that on air months ago, and they'll hype that up towards the inauguration, and then they'll have a big false flag on the black people and the brown people and the migrants, and then the mayors and everybody and governors are like, Trump's coming to kill the migrants, Trump's coming to kill the migrants, Trump's coming to kill them,
[00:22:32.869 --> 00:22:33.349]  kill them, kill them.
[00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:39.630]  And then as soon as Trump gets in, the globalists kill some migrants and blame it on Trump and blame it on you and blame it on me, and there you go.
[00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:41.609]  I mean, this is not hard.
[00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:48.289]  I said over and over again, as soon as Trump's president-elect, NATO will start bombing inside Russia.
[00:22:48.829 --> 00:22:51.490]  With him being president-elect two weeks, they started it.
[00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:53.190]  I mean, this isn't hard, people.
[00:22:55.829 --> 00:23:01.210]  So, I've got all this other ribbiting news, really interesting stuff, really crazy stuff, really entertaining stuff.
[00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.529]  But, to me, this isn't a show about entertainment.
[00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.049]  It's about, okay, this is what the bad guys are doing.
[00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.789]  This is what they're going to pull.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:29.140]  And they're going to use this to get Trump off balance and suck all the oxygen out of the room and make the whole agenda new lockdowns and hysteria and deadly shots, even if he gets in, so that the economy doesn't come back, so that things still continue to collapse, so they can roll out their new cashless society,
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:46.509]  unified ledger, you don't own anything, it's all put in a digital tokenized pool, and then they turn the economy back on after you accept that for a time And then once everybody's trained to be under it, then they start consolidating things even more.
[00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.890]  You'll own nothing and be happy.
[00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:49.470]  You'll eat the bugs and be happy.
[00:23:51.509 --> 00:24:00.750]  So then, right on time last week, Peter Hotez, the new spokesperson, he's the new Fauci officially for the UN and the globalists, on the pandemics.
[00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:09.150]  Big pharma shill Peter Hotez warns potential pandemics will come crashing down on January 21st on Trump administration.
[00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:17.839]  And I said last week, I said, okay, this is it.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.579]  They're going with it.
[00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:20.559]  Because that's their spokesperson.
[00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:22.119]  I mean, it's not my opinion.
[00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:25.200]  He said, he'll crash down on him.
[00:24:25.779 --> 00:24:27.539]  He lists 11 new things.
[00:24:27.859 --> 00:24:28.819]  Nothing will stop it.
[00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:29.519]  It's everywhere.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:37.019]  Yeah, and only the shots will save you, and this will take over the Trump administration and all his time and energy.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.420]  So we'll be in control, and our people will.
[00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:43.259]  And we'll, don't worry, we'll be in charge.
[00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:48.069]  I'm going to come back and go deep into this and all the big developments.
[00:24:48.089 --> 00:24:48.529]  Here it is.
[00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.329]  Stack of articles.
[00:24:49.509 --> 00:24:51.390]  Here comes Disease X outbreak.
[00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:53.470]  I don't know what it is, but it's like airborne Ebola.
[00:24:55.009 --> 00:24:56.230]  Told you that was the next one.
[00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.210]  Impacts the United States and around the world.
[00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.210]  Run for the hills.
[00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.529]  Next, Africa Disease X invokes fears of COVID-like pandemic.
[00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:06.450]  Look at this article.
[00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:11.950]  Ooh, NBC. Why the threat of bird flu makes the presidential transition problematic.
[00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.009]  Oh!
[00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.069]  Oh, it's going to take control of Trump.
[00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:26.170]  Oh, we can't have RFK Jr. now at HHS, they're saying, because he won't tell you to take all your shots so things can reopen because we're going to have to close again.
[00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.329]  Oh, the new virus that's about to be released.
[00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:34.829]  We don't know if it's this new thing that makes your eyes bleed and targets kids.
[00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.869]  Kids are mainly dying like Bill Gates predicted two years ago.
[00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.569]  The next pandemic will hit children.
[00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.549]  We'll get that clip for you.
[00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:48.150]  And lo and behold, they won't tell us what it is, but then there's the H1N1. They say, oh, it's going to mutate and kill humans any minute.
[00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.849]  Why?
[00:25:49.970 --> 00:26:04.319]  Scientists believe it'll probably mutate I'm going to show this to you.
[00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:06.779]  I mean, this is naked out in the open.
[00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:08.539]  Two new incredible products.

[00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:41.910]  You can't get it before Christmas.
[00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.849]  It starts shipping again.
[00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.450]  Everybody that ordered will get it before Christmas, but more is coming in, but it won't ship till the 23rd.

[00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:53.109]  But more of those coming the 23rd.
[00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.150]  You can pre-order that right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.690]  And of course, the Ultimate CMOS ready to ship.
[00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:00.930]  Everything's there right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:18.329]  Alright, I am bringing you all of this hardcore information not to scare you, but because I have a responsibility to tell you what is happening, and I know most of you can see it for yourselves.
[00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.529]  You don't need me to tell you.
[00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.390]  That's why you're the Paul Revere's.
[00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:23.430]  You're the ambassadors.
[00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.589]  You are the tip of the spear.
[00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:40.089]  You are the people that hold humanity's Destiny in your hands.
[00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:42.049]  You're the missionaries.
[00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:47.349]  You're the vanguard.
[00:28:48.569 --> 00:29:04.920]  So, instead of reaching 30, 40 million people a day, we reach 100 million a day when you get excited and you take the articles and the videos from Real Alex Jones on X and at AJN Live, the Alex Jones Network, And you share them on your email list,
[00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:05.680]  your text message.
[00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:06.819]  You share them by word of mouth.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.740]  You tell those you give it to to share it.
[00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:13.940]  And when they share it, tell those they give it to to share it.
[00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:15.259]  Hey, pass it along.
[00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:17.059]  Humans understand that.
[00:29:17.539 --> 00:29:32.640]  It's the Human Grapevine Network, but it's not rumors when you give them one of my reports or one of our articles or one of my live feeds because I will show everybody and I will explain it.
[00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:48.680]  I want to hit the latest developments because it's official, and I am so sick of this, and I'm frustrated and angry, but at least we're not going to get caught flat-footed, and the globalists are going to have a big problem with this new disease X crap.
[00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.940]  And they are throwing the kitchen sink at things this time.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.960]  It's not going to be just one virus and one poison shot.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.779]  And there's a lot that goes into this.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:23.059]  Most of the death we know is from the shots, so they're going to attribute that death To the erased immune systems and all the illnesses and everything that's happening from the replicating, self-replicating mRNA spike protein and cancer viruses that are in all of these so-called COVID injections and the new flu shots have the so-called COVID vaccine in as well.
[00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:23.900]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:26.700]  They are just bombing the hell out of us.
[00:30:28.729 --> 00:30:37.109]  And if we don't get ahead of it, which we're a little bit ahead of it, but we've got to get really ahead of it, they're going to be successful.
[00:30:37.109 --> 00:30:38.730]  So this is an information war.
[00:30:38.849 --> 00:30:42.809]  That's why the globalists are everywhere saying, get him off the air.
[00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:44.349]  Get his guest off the air.
[00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:52.410]  Because they've said in congressional testimony and in all their think tanks, the Rockefeller Foundation's attacked us, the ADL, the Southern Property Law Center, you've seen it.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.519]  They track back the majority of the resistance to this platform.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.619]  Now, in the past, it was pretty much us on a major scale.
[00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:08.180]  A lot of the great people, but they didn't have the giant audiences.
[00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:10.660]  And we have those folks on and boost everything they do.
[00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:11.539]  There's a lot of them.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.420]  Now there are more people that get almost all of it or basically all of it.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.700]  So we're in a lot better position.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.720]  If they were to kill me tomorrow, God forbid, or whatever, day late, dollar short.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:34.339]  But still, we are the most effective, powerful transmitter of the truth and getting ahead of the enemy.
[00:31:35.339 --> 00:31:38.880]  So I want to hit this huge news right now, but I wanted to show you this first.
[00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:41.019]  There are literally thousands of these.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.240]  I'm just going to show you a few of them.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.220]  This is today and last night's news.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.420]  Judge Way's fate of the Onion's buyout of Infowars.
[00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:51.019]  They never bought it, by the way.
[00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:55.299]  Alex Jones alleges fraud and collusion InfoWars auction process.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.220]  Well, I mean, it's right there.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.480]  Alex Jones' lawyer accuses the Onion of voodoo economics in court.
[00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:02.319]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.519]  The Onion's bid for InfoWars is still in court as judge reviews auction.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.579]  That's day two today.
[00:32:07.819 --> 00:32:08.720]  He extended it to today.
[00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:11.799]  Auctioneer defends the Onion's bid for InfoWars in court.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.920]  And it goes on and on.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.200]  Now, the U.S. trustee's on the stand right now.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.160]  The Justice Department guy that ran all this.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:19.819]  So...
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.220]  That's where we are.
[00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:37.529]  One way or the other, unless they implement Obama's internet kill switch that's still in place, I intend to stay on air.
[00:32:37.569 --> 00:32:41.049]  We have the Alex Jones Network built, larger studio, almost done.
[00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.609]  You've seen the basic studio.
[00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:43.529]  We can get the job done.
[00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.730]  Saddle up links to all of its servers, crew.
[00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.049]  That takes money to win that fight.
[00:32:49.349 --> 00:32:55.390]  And I am fighting these people in court, and I could spend the next two hours explaining it all to you, but...
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.480]  We have bigger fish to fry, but this is a microcosm, a canary in the coal mine of everything we face.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.559]  But Elon Musk lawyers were in court for the first hour of the hearing that went until 7 o'clock last night.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.440]  And they said, we've reached a deal with the Justice Department that's put itself in my case and the Bloomberg lawyers, the Everytown people.
[00:33:19.579 --> 00:33:21.079]  It's not Sandy Hook families.
[00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:21.839]  It's Bloomberg.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.140]  It's the Democrat Party NGO. That's all come out in court.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.779]  We already knew that, but it's official now.
[00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:30.359]  And they said, we want his handle.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.980]  We want his name.
[00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:32.900]  And X said, we own the accounts.
[00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:36.359]  And Jones has the persona.
[00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:38.940]  You can't transfer somebody's persona under the 13th Amendment.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:57.109]  And then yesterday in court, they said, well, we've reached an agreement with most people That if we're able to buy these accounts, which they can't sell, we'll just own the content on them and we'll migrate that off of there and then say Alex Jones doesn't own his past shows or his own face or any of that.
[00:33:57.289 --> 00:34:03.430]  It's not they got an agreement with X. X lawyers said we don't have jurisdiction over Alex Jones' content.
[00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:24.010]  We just have jurisdiction over the railway of information that is X. So again, the digital fiber optic Destination of X is owned by Elon Musk, and no one can take that away from Alex Jones because Alex Jones doesn't own the railway.
[00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:29.650]  If I'm a locomotive, that's another railway company, but I've paid to be on that railway.
[00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:42.590]  If my railway goes into bankruptcy, somebody can claim they can then own the locomotive, but just because that locomotive is on Elon Musk's railway, they don't then own Elon Musk's railway.
[00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.539]  So, X didn't betray me in court yesterday.
[00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:47.639]  Elon Musk didn't betray me.
[00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.260]  This is all cut dry.
[00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:52.320]  They do not own my content.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.900]  I do.
[00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:53.980]  The public does.
[00:34:54.099 --> 00:34:54.599]  It's free to air.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:01.980]  The bad guys are claiming they own it because they want to ban it and take it down everywhere, and that's not going to work, and I'll fight that at that level as well.
[00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:24.969]  They've just been beaten at the X level of saying we're going to get Alex Jones' handle, and Musk said no, that belongs to us, and Jones has a license to be here, and he will continue to be here, and you won't get his followers, you won't get that information, but you've got to separately find out whether or not in court you think you own his past shows or his tweets or photos of his family he posted there.
[00:35:25.769 --> 00:35:36.650]  It's my personal place where I talk about what I think, what I do, and I put my show there because that is my speech, my communication to the public, like a letter I write to somebody.
[00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:44.969]  If I lost in a bankruptcy case 100 years ago, no one would ever claim, you know, we own your words.
[00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:53.429]  Unless I had sold those to a publisher in that work, and then they were able to get the rights to a book or something, yeah, they can do that.
[00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:57.730]  I've never debated that, but that's a book, and they will have the rights to those two books.
[00:35:57.849 --> 00:35:59.429]  Probably will never print them again.
[00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.929]  It's capture and destroy is what they have said they're doing to me.
[00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:12.010]  Which is a microcosm of the economic war on Americans in the West, in general, the deindustrialization, the shipping of jobs overseas, the war on our families, the war on the currency.
[00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:16.210]  I mean, you already know, cutting off the energy, cutting off the food, it's siege.
[00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.730]  It's sanctions against the West.
[00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.150]  That's how they're trying to bring us, their social engineering, under their control.
[00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:27.329]  So, that's where we are.
[00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.869]  And I agree with what Musk lawyers said.
[00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:32.610]  We have no jurisdiction over his content.
[00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:34.829]  You figure that out in court with him.
[00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:39.230]  So that's where we are on that front.
[00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:48.170]  But I will continue at every level to fight them over the First Amendment and over free speech and over the 13th Amendment.
[00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.789]  Which they said in court a month ago, Mr. Jones is a special person.
[00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:54.429]  Actually said he's a special case.
[00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.590]  The 13th Amendment does not apply to him.
[00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.690]  That's preposterous, the amendment against slavery and injured servitude.
[00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:20.889]  When Ron Goldberg sued after O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murder, but won a civil case, they tried to say they own the name O.J. Simpson, and the court said, you don't.
[00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.349]  So it's really simple.
[00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:25.329]  They want my identity.
[00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.630]  They want your identity.
[00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:27.949]  That's what globalism is.
[00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.010]  That's what social credit score is.
[00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:40.630]  They build a digital identity that they say is you, that they say is guilty or good or whatever it is, and then they completely control where you can go, what you can do, what you can say, and what you can even represent.
[00:37:40.949 --> 00:37:47.050]  That is stealing your soul, stealing your identity, stealing your essence, stealing your power of communication.
[00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:56.650]  That's why all of you must exercise your free speech in every way you can, like building your muscles so you're stronger and have your real identity out there.
[00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.570]  If you don't, they'll misrepresent you.
[00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:07.550]  Like saying, you're a white male, you're evil, you're the problem in the world, you're racist, you're a killer, you're a thief, you're a scumbag, because you're a white male.
[00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:13.690]  And that's all done as a psychological program to get most white males to bow to the left and say, I'll do whatever you say.
[00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.510]  Don't bully me.
[00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:20.789]  And for everybody else to feel like you can be bullied because, well, you're an admitted bad person because you're a white male.
[00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:28.230]  And it's mainly the ADL and the left and Soros out there teaching people that white males are inherently bad.
[00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:31.829]  That's like what Hitler did where he said Jews are inherently bad.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:42.179]  So that's particularly nasty from the ADL and all of that because it's a Hitlerian idea that somebody's bad because of what color their skin is or because they're Christian.
[00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:45.159]  So extreme Hitler behavior.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.800]  The left always calls everything Hitler that's not, but then they're the closest thing to Hitler I've seen in my lifetime.
[00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:54.519]  So I want to move out of this subject.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.659]  It is obviously very important.
[00:38:57.619 --> 00:39:09.719]  The U.S. trustee, Chris Murray, has said to the security last week that if the judge rules that the auction was legitimate yesterday, which he extended today, or today, he will order the Internet cutoff minutes after.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.420]  That's done, and so this could be our last show here if that happens.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.260]  I can't imagine...
[00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:20.849]  The judge would certify this fraud.
[00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.010]  I mean, it's head spinning, the stuff they did and what they claimed.
[00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:32.250]  And I've already gone over that ad nauseum, but it's bizarre how arrogant they are and what they thought they could get away with it.
[00:39:32.289 --> 00:39:32.809]  Maybe they will.
[00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.789]  But it is critical.
[00:39:37.259 --> 00:39:52.760]  That if we get taken off the air today, all of you tell everyone, every day, I mean, intensely, hey, the show they're scared of is at AJN Live on X and Real Alex Jones, and we've got alexjones.network, which is just a basic site with some links there,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.559]  but it's going to be news articles and everything you see at InfoWars, just like that.
[00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:03.639]  And we're going to continue on to fight, and they're going to attack that, even though I don't own it, and try to get that.
[00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:05.199]  But that'll be a long fight as well.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.619]  And, you know, I've obviously got offers and things to go work for other folks around the country.
[00:40:09.619 --> 00:40:11.260]  They can't stop me yet from speaking.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:11.880]  They're trying.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.579]  But they want to be able to say everything I ever did the last 30 years is owned by them, so they can remove it from the Internet.
[00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:19.300]  They've said that.
[00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:22.280]  And, of course, that'll just cause a Streisand effect.
[00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:30.989]  So that said, before I hit the big news, they've officially rolled out the new Disease X Hysteria, and they admit it is to block the Trump agenda.
[00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:41.909]  Before I get to the chilling developments that are so critical there, it'll take me at least, because I'm going to be very judicious here, but I'm going to move as quick as I can, but I'm going into this.
[00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.269]  It'll take at least 45 minutes.
[00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:52.269]  That'll hit some of the other breaking news and issues, and then I'll take calls for a couple hours here on this live Tuesday, December 10th, 2024 transmission.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.159]  But this has been a cliffhanger.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:04.619]  All the times they tried to take us off air, all the illegal things they did, times I stood up to them, how many times we've been delivered from these wicked ones.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.900]  So please continue to pray for the broadcast, and please continue to support.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:17.800]  And that said, my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, makes some of the very best supplements you're going to find anywhere.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.980]  And he's a big sponsor of our operation.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.219]  He's a sponsor of M4s, and he's a sponsor of AJN Live.
[00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:26.480]  The Alex Jones Network.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.780]  So do your Christmas shopping there.
[00:41:30.019 --> 00:41:32.639]  Next Level Foundational Energy is an incredible product.
[00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:34.320]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:44.300]  It's concentrated breakdown of folic acid with a bunch of other key natural compounds that is pure energy in your cells, cleans them out, while it gives you incredible energy with no letdown.
[00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:47.059]  Methylfolate's been all the rage for many years.
[00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:49.360]  This is one of the best formulas of it.
[00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:50.679]  It is amazing.
[00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:54.440]  If you like good energy and you've never experienced this, you should experience it.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:05.719]  There's also, and by the way, it's the biggest sale ever there, up to 50% off, like on this deal, quercetin max, highest quality quercetin that just does incredible things in the body as well, CoQ10.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.719]  Everybody knows about CoQ10.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.099]  Everybody knows about quercetin.
[00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.179]  Everybody knows about liposomal.
[00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:15.809]  Cleans out your whole body, gives you incredible stamina, libido, energy, immune system.
[00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.010]  In the winter, with all the crap they're releasing, you really should be on this year-round, but particularly now.
[00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:28.449]  And high-quality organic versions are the ones that work, and they're up to $150 a bottle because they put huge markup on them.
[00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.050]  These don't have that.
[00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.409]  Right now, these are $30 a bottle, and they're the highest quality you're going to find anywhere.
[00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.349]  It's even less than that when you get them together as a combo.
[00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.969]  My goodness, they're $25 a bottle.
[00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:46.210]  So, normal sale, they're $30 a bottle.
[00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:47.929]  So right now, they're $25 a bottle.
[00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.670]  So get those at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.630]  And then let me tell you about this.
[00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:59.039]  My dad originally came out with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and now it's available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:02.719]  The classic, with a blue label instead of a red label.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.679]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, all the highest quality vitamins and minerals.
[00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:08.579]  All of the key amino acids.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.320]  This is such an amazing product.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:10.900]  Tastes great.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.599]  It's all natural.
[00:43:13.079 --> 00:43:14.699]  A little scoop makes a whole picture of it.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:24.059]  Great for the morning, great for lunch, great for evening, great for children, adults, old people particularly, because you get a way better absorption in the gut when it's liquid than obviously from pills.
[00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:31.860]  So vitamin mineral fusion is at drjonesnaturals.com, but it's going up in hours on the shopping cart.
[00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:40.500]  It's not there yet, but I was told by 3 o'clock today it will be at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:50.579]  The classic now available at drjonesnaturals.com, and that's critical to keep us on the air, plus it's a great product.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.460]  Now, I'm going to hit this, then I'm done plugging, I'm going to hit the big news.
[00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:59.550]  Two new products are now in stock at thealexjohnstore.com.
[00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:04.050]  And if you love Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood, you're going to love these products.
[00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:13.969]  These are high-quality concentrated gummies, Ultimate Turmeric, the highest quality concentrate of turmeric, and a bunch of other known super compounds.
[00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.070]  Ginger root concentrate extract.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.059]  Black pepper, pepper, rind, concentrate.
[00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:24.539]  It all goes after inflammation.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:32.820]  All goes after any issues in the body, joints, heart, brain, bones.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.019]  Everybody should be on turmeric.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.320]  Raw turmeric is incredible.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.340]  Raw ginger is incredible.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.719]  Raw concentrated pepper is great.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.300]  But this is super concentrate.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.940]  Everybody, men, women, and children, old, young, need to be on ultimate turmeric.
[00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:52.309]  Now available exclusively, and by exclusively, this private label.
[00:44:52.929 --> 00:44:57.369]  With the sponsor, we were starting to work together six months ago.
[00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.030]  They said, well, we know you want to sell supplements.
[00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.710]  What do you think?
[00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:07.909]  And I said, well, just go to the top people, the top ratings, and get them to private label it.
[00:45:07.929 --> 00:45:08.650]  Most of them do it.
[00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:10.570]  And some don't like me, so they won't.
[00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.610]  So just go to the top two or three people, find out, get the best deal you can.
[00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:17.389]  Usually they're going to be listeners.
[00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:18.469]  Will we get an even better deal?
[00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:23.690]  And then make sure they'll let you discount it some so we can dominate the market.
[00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:25.090]  And then you call one place.
[00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:25.789]  No, we're not going to work with you.
[00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:26.190]  Call the next.
[00:45:26.289 --> 00:45:26.710]  Yeah, we will.
[00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.730]  We love to work with you.
[00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.130]  And usually it's the first people they call because, you know, just look at the top two or three.
[00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.869]  There's always hundreds of makers of all this stuff because it works so well.
[00:45:35.269 --> 00:45:36.170]  The market's flooded.
[00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:40.030]  So you just go to the top rated, top people, the quality, the best, the best ratings.
[00:45:40.329 --> 00:45:41.429]  You don't reinvent the wheel.
[00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.269]  You just private label it.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.940]  And that's what this Ultimate Turmeric Formula is.
[00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:52.380]  That's what Ultimate Iron is with a huge dose of organic vitamin C and more.
[00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:55.400]  The health benefits of all this stuff is on record.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.800]  It really is incredible.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.179]  So Ultimate Iron and Ultimate Turmeric gummies now available.
[00:46:05.939 --> 00:46:07.340]  At thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.719]  Special deals, special discounts on top of deals.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.539]  There's huge sales.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.420]  Biggest sales ever at the Alex Jones store right now.
[00:46:18.679 --> 00:46:20.980]  And again, I want to say something that I'm done here.
[00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:27.619]  I see a lot of people on X, a lot of people on InfoWars going, you know, Alex is under globalist attack.
[00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:28.559]  He's under deep state attack.
[00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:29.699]  He's under Democrat Party attack.
[00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:32.610]  We understand he's not like a regular show.
[00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:38.590]  He needs to raise a lot more funds than other people because they're suing him and attacking him and lying about him.
[00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.469]  He also built a real media system with reporters and hosts and researchers and writers.
[00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.190]  We don't have the corporate funders.
[00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:47.730]  But some people say, man, you know, why is this guy saying he needs support?
[00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:57.750]  Well, why did Trump need billions of dollars to win this election and hundreds of millions just to have lawyers and poll watchers in all the key districts and he stopped most of the fraud and we won?
[00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.050]  It takes money to win a war.
[00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:07.329]  It's undisputed that I'm the most attacked talk show host and media person in the world for a reason.
[00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:09.769]  So I have you as my backers.
[00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:12.349]  This is a contact sport.
[00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.250]  I'm fighting the big bad boys.
[00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.210]  This is big boy, big boy pants stuff.
[00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:19.110]  Okay?
[00:47:19.869 --> 00:47:22.110]  I'm up here predicting what they're going to do.
[00:47:22.269 --> 00:47:24.210]  It almost always happens, unfortunately.
[00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.610]  I'm trying to predict it.
[00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.829]  So, hey, I predicted all this.
[00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:27.730]  They're about to do this.
[00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:28.409]  Let's stop it.
[00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:31.989]  Oh, God, they started World War III. Oh, God, they're launching new pandemics.
[00:47:32.289 --> 00:47:34.690]  Oh, my gosh, I told you they'd start hyping race war.
[00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:35.269]  Here it is.
[00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:36.769]  And they're saying they're going to have a race war.
[00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.610]  The question is, can we expose it and stop it?
[00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.230]  So, I said 25 years ago.
[00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:43.170]  I've already made a bunch of predictions.
[00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:43.829]  They've come true.
[00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.110]  I don't want to keep making them and having them come true.
[00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:50.210]  I want enough people to go, wow, this guy really knows what he's talking about.
[00:47:50.369 --> 00:47:51.289]  How does he know that?
[00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.650]  And then go, look, because the enemy admits it.
[00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.869]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:47:54.969 --> 00:47:55.889]  I'm not that smart.
[00:47:56.329 --> 00:48:01.289]  But I'm sure as hell smart enough to listen to the globalists because they follow through on what they're going to do and try to stop them.
[00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.789]  I mean, this is not rocket science.
[00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:09.289]  And on my children, I don't have as much money as I need.
[00:48:09.429 --> 00:48:11.670]  I barely have enough money to just fend them off.
[00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.449]  And I need more.
[00:48:13.989 --> 00:48:14.630]  Here's the problem.
[00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:20.010]  I need lots more money so I don't have to spend all my time with barely enough to beg constantly.
[00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:32.130]  That's why the majority of you that won't ever get off the fence and go get incredible products at the alishjonesstore.com or drjonesnadrills.com, I mean, let me tell you, you take next level foundational energy, you'll go, whoa, this is amazing.
[00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.010]  Clean stimulant that's not a stimulant with none of the stimulant feeling.
[00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.650]  You're just awake.
[00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.070]  I'm on it right now.
[00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.489]  Ultimate CMOS is the highest quality CMOS, Irish CMOS. It's incredible.
[00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.329]  The superfood.
[00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:47.650]  I mean, I'm not blowing smoke at you and...
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:59.340]  If just a few percentage of you would go do this, you wouldn't have to sit there and hear it and go, man, he covers good topics, but I got to hear a five, ten minute begging up here.
[00:48:59.539 --> 00:49:02.880]  Well, I hate begging, but you know what I hate even more than begging?
[00:49:03.039 --> 00:49:08.199]  Give it into the new world order and letting him enslave all of us and lock us up and give us poison shots and kill us in nuclear war.
[00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:12.420]  And I also see people saying, oh, Jones, he's got these scary headlines every day.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.340]  All I do is write a headline about what I really think is going on.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:31.500]  I was the first to say, three weeks ago, World War III is officially begun, and I predict within 48 hours other world leaders will say it.
[00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:33.599]  Because all the conditions were there, I studied that.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.739]  Within 48 hours they were all saying it.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.480]  I said before Putin, he tested this missile to show MIRV technology and he can get past their missile defense systems and no one else was saying that.
[00:49:43.679 --> 00:49:45.900]  And then Putin came out and said the exact same stuff later.
[00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:49.059]  I mean, I don't know why I know this and other people don't know it.
[00:49:49.199 --> 00:49:51.099]  It's stupidly obvious and easy.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:59.639]  But most people don't study short-range, medium-range, long-range, intercontinental ballistic missiles and weapons systems, delivery systems.
[00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:00.760]  I guess I am a weirdo.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.039]  But I don't think knowing that stuff is nerdly.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.980]  I don't think of myself as a nerd.
[00:50:06.739 --> 00:50:08.760]  I don't think having knowledge is nerdly.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.780]  It's what a man is supposed to do.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:21.659]  If something can kill me and my whole family and kill all of you in 30 minutes, we've got Promethean power, fire of the gods.
[00:50:23.619 --> 00:50:26.039]  You bet I know about threats to me and my family.
[00:50:26.039 --> 00:50:27.519]  That's what a man is supposed to do.
[00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:35.300]  And this broadcast tells you about the threats, and our guests tell you about the threats, so that you can make provision and defeat them.
[00:50:36.769 --> 00:50:38.849]  That's the goal of this broadcast.
[00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:45.349]  Not to get up here and list all these terrible things going on.
[00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.570]  That's one of the most common attacks.
[00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:49.309]  It's like, oh, he's just fear-mongering.
[00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:51.429]  I told you World War III had begun.
[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.650]  I said within 48 hours it would be announced.
[00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:54.230]  It was.
[00:50:55.929 --> 00:51:03.590]  I mean, I told you Trump would make his announcement that he won at 127. You know, sometimes it's just beyond me how I know all this.
[00:51:03.809 --> 00:51:06.250]  But most of this is verifiable out in the open.
[00:51:10.759 --> 00:51:14.500]  So, I have a job, and, you know, Paul Revere's a fearmonger.
[00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:15.539]  He said the British are landing.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.719]  They did.
[00:51:17.559 --> 00:51:19.079]  One is by land, two is by sea.
[00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:21.559]  You know the lantern in the church tower?
[00:51:25.219 --> 00:51:28.099]  I told you decades ago the transgender movement's coming for your kids.
[00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:30.440]  And they did.
[00:51:32.139 --> 00:51:33.440]  Told you it was a transhuman movement.
[00:51:33.539 --> 00:51:34.159]  Now they admit it is.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.239]  I mean, I just read their own admissions.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.619]  I know their own battle plan.
[00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:43.880]  And I'm going to come back and do the deep dive on the official rollout of the new Plandemics.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.480]  It's on.
[00:51:45.619 --> 00:51:46.480]  We got to get ahead of this.
[00:51:46.539 --> 00:51:47.260]  We got to stop it now.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.440]  You want to get locked down?
[00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:49.440]  You want to get bankrupted?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.400]  You want your family to get shot up with deadly poisons?
[00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:54.659]  Then we're going to stop it together, but we got to admit what's going down.
[00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:56.179]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.900]  Thanks for your support.
[00:51:57.099 --> 00:51:58.500]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:51:58.559 --> 00:52:00.619]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.579]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.440]  So, we need to stay on air.
[00:52:07.619 --> 00:52:09.039]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:52:09.199 --> 00:52:13.059]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:13.239 --> 00:52:18.079]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.039]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:23.659]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:31.530]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:33.429]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:36.889]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:52:37.889 --> 00:52:39.789]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.929]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:52:43.289 --> 00:52:43.849]  Unfortunately...
[00:52:44.989 --> 00:52:48.829]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:54.929]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:55.750]  That continues.
[00:52:55.949 --> 00:52:56.769]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:52:56.889 --> 00:52:59.610]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:52:59.789 --> 00:53:00.409]  I designed it.
[00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:06.869]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:53:06.969 --> 00:53:08.329]  They are a piece of history.
[00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.329]  They are pure silver.
[00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.110]  They are minted here in America.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.599]  2,000 of these.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.039]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.440]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.679]  They are incredible.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:30.460]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:38.570]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:41.889]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.829]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:58.880]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:53:59.159 --> 00:54:00.639]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.500]  Don't tread on me.
[00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:03.840]  1776, another one with Alex Jones.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.599]  You're truly on it.
[00:54:04.739 --> 00:54:07.639]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.179]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.000]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:15.190]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:15.289 --> 00:54:17.530]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:18.789]  They surprised me with this.
[00:54:18.869 --> 00:54:19.869]  I just learned this morning.
[00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.250]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:26.570]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:31.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:54:31.889 --> 00:54:34.809]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:36.829]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:38.610]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:54:39.329 --> 00:54:41.670]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.449]  We probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:46.250]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:50.210]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.269]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:54:52.409 --> 00:54:53.110]  And I already called them.
[00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.250]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:56.150]  So that means there's...
[00:54:57.769 --> 00:54:59.650]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:54:59.809 --> 00:55:02.329]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.750]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:06.010]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.230]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:55:07.389 --> 00:55:08.989]  This baby is amazing.
[00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:14.349]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.250]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:55:18.389 --> 00:55:21.590]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantel.
[00:55:22.199 --> 00:55:29.659]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:37.840]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump getting inaugurated next month.
[00:55:38.019 --> 00:55:39.619]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:47.900]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fun the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:57.469 --> 00:56:06.909]  The entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.710]  You know you're in a war, right?
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.760]  And it's a declared war.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.760]  The globalists have declared war on team humanity.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.159]  They've declared war on the God that made us.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.579]  It is not incredible.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:20.800]  It is not heroic.
[00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:23.260]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.719]  It is survival.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.000]  This is the priority.
[00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:29.980]  This is the real world.
[00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:30.880]  This is game time.
[00:56:31.099 --> 00:56:32.780]  This is the crossroads of human destiny.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.360]  Right now.
[00:56:33.539 --> 00:56:34.139]  Right now.
[00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:39.750]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is!
[00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:41.989]  We need maximum urgency!
[00:56:42.329 --> 00:56:45.289]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen!
[00:56:45.289 --> 00:56:46.630]  Don't you understand that?
[00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.550]  I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[00:56:49.769 --> 00:56:51.550]  I want you to kill with truth.
[00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:53.090]  Kill with your will.
[00:56:53.449 --> 00:56:53.829]  Kill!
[00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:54.469]  Kill!
[00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:55.849]  Kill their lies!
[00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:00.170]  Yeah, you boys from Langley are back again.
[00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.070]  Putting Al-Qaeda in charge of Syria.
[00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:21.860]  Alright, we are now into our number two, and I know that it has been an entertaining part of the show over the years when I blow up and get mad,
[00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:32.880]  but I don't really ever do that very often on air anymore, do I? But I do do it behind the scenes some.
[00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.289]  And you know what?
[00:57:36.489 --> 00:57:49.289]  It's a normal response for someone full-time that sits here and watches the globalists engage in the most psychotic crimes the world's ever seen, endangering every man, woman, and child on this planet.
[00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:55.730]  And I am very angry and upset at the globalists, but I'm also upset...
[00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:05.230]  Even the people I know that are awake to all this still act like it's a hobby or it's just part of their life over there.
[00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:12.050]  And they're still just happy enjoying themselves going about their business.
[00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:33.050]  If an asteroid was a million miles away and was scheduled say some 10 mile long asteroid to slam into us in a month and was estimated to kill all life on the surface of the planet And we had the capability to launch spacecraft with nuclear weapons to knock it off course,
[00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.929]  and no one got upset and no one did it.
[00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.829]  Would you be a little pissed off?
[00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:55.269]  Well, the asteroids coming towards us are the globalistic population plan, the World War III they've already started, all the division they've sowed, all the poisons they're putting into us, and they're just evil, psychotic, satanic,
[00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:57.309]  Megalomaniacs.
[00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:02.610]  And yeah, I like to go have a good time as much as the next person.
[00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:06.929]  And it's normal to have rest and relaxation.
[00:59:06.929 --> 00:59:14.510]  It is normal to want to go eat dinner or watch a movie or go to a football game or a concert.
[00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.429]  I'm not even criticizing anybody.
[00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:19.670]  I'm just simply saying...
[00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:27.030]  If your house was on fire, you'd probably try to put it out or at least get out of the house.
[00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:31.110]  You wouldn't say, I'm going to go in the living room and watch television.
[00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:37.369]  Or maybe play a game of poker or ping pong or Parcheesi.
[00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.809]  And so that's where I'm at right now.
[00:59:42.949 --> 00:59:45.369]  I mean, it should be so easy to reject this evil.
[00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.000]  It should be so easy.
[00:59:48.159 --> 00:59:49.360]  And we're right there at the cusp.
[00:59:49.539 --> 00:59:57.780]  People are waking up to the fact that we got some really bad, evil people with horrible, predatory intentions running things.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:10.340]  But I gotta tell you, my response of being beyond pissed off is completely normal.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.619]  I apologize to the crew.
[01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:23.150]  Having to occasionally put up with me, man, I really wasn't even screaming a bunch of stuff, just stomping around, saying I can't even go on air right now.
[01:00:23.409 --> 01:00:25.309]  And that happened in the first five minutes.
[01:00:25.369 --> 01:00:28.829]  You saw the dead air, because I just blew up and said I can't go on air right now.
[01:00:29.969 --> 01:00:35.110]  Because I'm going to just start screaming MF-er and just turn this desk over and start stomping on everything.
[01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:42.289]  Because I just, at a certain point, I'm like, Robbie the Robot, when I get too much, you know, information, and I'm just like...
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.679]  And I know that's fun.
[01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:50.659]  And I know it resonates with a lot of people who are pissed off too.
[01:00:51.519 --> 01:00:56.780]  But really, I'm just kind of idling right now here on air.
[01:00:58.139 --> 01:01:06.320]  Because, you know, I think about that clip from last week of Peter Hotez, who is a psychotic killer, is a rat-like, murderous bastard.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.579]  He murders the truth.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.539]  He pushes deadly poison shots and lies to everybody.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.320]  He's their spokesperson now.
[01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:31.340]  In the United States, of the death cult, and he says, you know, you watch, Trump's gonna get crashing down on him, 11 new viruses, and nothing will stop it, only the shots will save you, and we're gonna have to have new lockdowns again, and I'm just sitting there, looking at a master villain,
[01:01:32.179 --> 01:01:44.519]  Renfield minion of Satan, and Here we are a week later and they've rolled this whole thing out.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.559]  And I am just beyond outraged.
[01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:55.280]  But I'll say this.
[01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:03.739]  I'm not the only one.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.880]  And when the public finds out what the globalists have really done and they're starting too fast.
[01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:14.989]  And they know that.
[01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:28.309]  So how do you cover up one giant crime and the end of a financial bubble and all the derivatives and the scams there that would make Bernie Madoff blush and Sam Bankman Freed blush?
[01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:43.610]  How do you make people forget about that?
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.340]  Well, you do it with a new, bigger story.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.179]  A new, bigger crisis.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.719]  And that's what all these crises are that are now rolling out.
[01:02:54.679 --> 01:02:57.679]  And I hear almost nothing from the Trump administration on it.
[01:02:57.739 --> 01:03:00.639]  I mean, he's fighting the World War III developments.
[01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.980]  And trying to secure the border and turn the economy back on.
[01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:08.280]  I mean, Trump's doing a wonderful job compared to the bad guys.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.760]  It's just we have a responsibility to expose this.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.300]  Alright, I'm too angry to do the show right now.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.280]  And there's no reason for me to just sit here.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.840]  I need to go walk around some, I need to drink some water, and get control of myself right now.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.880]  Because I can't talk.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.000]  I'm just going to start screaming cuss words here in a minute.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.179]  Which I'm not a very profane person, except when I get mad.
[01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:41.780]  And I don't want to stomp around here like an evil leprechaun.
[01:03:57.509 --> 01:04:02.309]  John Bowne really produced a powerful report on the poison shots and what's coming next.
[01:04:04.329 --> 01:04:05.989]  That we should air, so just get that ready.
[01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:09.010]  And we'll see if I can do the show.
[01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:11.550]  There's a good chance I'm not going to come back.
[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.889]  You know, maybe I should just turn the show off.
[01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:23.769]  Maybe that would get more people's attention if I just gave everybody the bad guys what they wanted and just pulled the plug and said, you guys just all go destroy yourselves.
[01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:27.389]  You just go enjoy World War III. But see, that's giving up and God doesn't want that.
[01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:28.349]  It's not...
[01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:31.510]  It's not that I'm even talking about giving up here.
[01:04:31.889 --> 01:04:35.010]  I'm trying to explain to people my frustration.
[01:04:35.409 --> 01:04:36.510]  Because I'm right.
[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.409]  I'm right about all of this.
[01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:39.309]  Everybody knows it.
[01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:40.610]  You're right about all of it.
[01:04:40.949 --> 01:04:45.570]  You don't need to be even smart to see what's going on.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.070]  So...
[01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.050]  But there are a lot of new people that don't know what's going on.
[01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.730]  And it's my job, and it's your job, I think...
[01:04:56.739 --> 01:04:57.619]  I postulate.
[01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:04.099]  It's your mission, if you choose to accept it, to be a Paul Revere, to be an alarmist.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.900]  We need alarmists during alarming times.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.099]  That's what an alarmist is.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:16.420]  And we are in alarming times.
[01:05:16.619 --> 01:05:17.659]  We are in dangerous times.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.500]  Who can deny that?
[01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.869]  No one.
[01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:39.110]  If someone is telling you we're not in alarming, dangerous times, and don't listen to people that say we're in danger.
[01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:49.489]  They have a death wish?
[01:05:53.969 --> 01:05:58.170]  I mean, World War III has begun.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.760]  Are you looking around?
[01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:05.019]  Oh, the streetlights still work and there's still food at the grocery store for now.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.960]  And we're still in this little bubble compared to the rest of the world.
[01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:13.159]  And people travel around the world and they come in and they go, God, I thought America was horrible.
[01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:13.639]  It's great.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.019]  Yeah, sweetheart.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.360]  And I've got four children.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.539]  And I love them.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.039]  And that means I love the world that they live in.
[01:06:24.199 --> 01:06:25.420]  That means I love you and your children.
[01:06:34.769 --> 01:06:36.010]  You know, I know what I need to do.
[01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.670]  I need to get my act together and not take calls today.
[01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:52.849]  And make myself just get on air and cover everything in these stacks.
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.550]  Because that's another one of my big frustrations.
[01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:56.329]  I'm kind of psychoanalyzing myself here on air.
[01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.389]  That's really what the show is, me talking to myself.
[01:06:58.809 --> 01:06:59.190]  Seriously.
[01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:00.809]  People ask who's in charge.
[01:07:00.969 --> 01:07:02.789]  I mean, it's like I'm sitting there talking to my subconscious.
[01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.670]  Who tells Jones what to say?
[01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:06.650]  My brain.
[01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:24.070]  And that's why I get so pissed off, is I do all this preparation, and then by the time I get on air now,
[01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:29.809]  and I'm looking at it all again, it just pisses me off.
[01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:37.110]  I mean, just these stacks right here is horrible news.
[01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:40.789]  And admitting the horrible news is how we stop it.
[01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:48.130]  But I get from about a third of the people that are anti-globalists.
[01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:52.730]  Well, still, you know, you're scaring people.
[01:07:52.909 --> 01:07:54.670]  What the hell are you talking?
[01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:58.110]  Hey, we shouldn't be bombing Russia with high-powered missiles.
[01:07:58.289 --> 01:07:59.389]  They're going to start responding.
[01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.610]  Every military analyst agrees.
[01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:04.349]  That's crazy.
[01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:07.190]  That's alarming.
[01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:12.070]  The globalists going, don't worry, we'll stop Trump with a new pandemic.
[01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.469]  It comes crashing down January 21st.
[01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:17.170]  And you see him rolling it all out.
[01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.329]  That's alarming.
[01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:26.189]  The corporate media hyping race war right on time and saying they have a plan for race war once Trump gets in.
[01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:27.529]  That's alarming.
[01:08:34.119 --> 01:08:39.760]  NATO and Israel and Turkey putting Al-Qaeda in charge of Syria is alarming.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:46.079]  NATO overthrowing the election and setting up a dictatorship in Romania is alarming.
[01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.760]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.420]  Tell you what.
[01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:05.529]  How about I just talk about the NFL? Hell, I can play you funny cat videos and dog videos all day and whale videos.
[01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:06.789]  I love all that stuff, by the way.
[01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.029]  All the time, I put stuff like that on the list to play.
[01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.729]  Like, oh, but here's how beautiful the earth is, what we're fighting for.
[01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:19.770]  And then I never play that either because it's just like...
[01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:29.369]  I mean, we got AOC saying Daniel Penny should be locked up because he's a danger.
[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:50.710]  While she wants millions of illegal aliens out of the 25 million that came in under Biden, millions are known criminals with murder, rape, arson, assault on police officers, and then this dimwit because they want idiots to talk to idiots.
[01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:51.510]  That's why they wanted Harris.
[01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:52.510]  That's what they think of you.
[01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.569]  The globalists think you're an idiot like Kamala Harris.
[01:09:55.689 --> 01:10:07.430]  They think you're a moron like AOC. So they find these ADIQ morons to read off a script, but that isn't actually what you want.
[01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.949]  Oh God.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.619]  Oh my God.
[01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:40.560]  They're making their move on humanity right now.
[01:10:41.079 --> 01:10:42.359]  I mean, that's really it.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.579]  It's the asteroid analogy.
[01:10:46.039 --> 01:10:50.380]  There's an asteroid a million miles away on current trajectory in a month that's going to hit us and kill everybody.
[01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:52.699]  Imagine if that was really happening.
[01:10:52.939 --> 01:10:54.000]  It was confirmed.
[01:10:54.539 --> 01:10:55.880]  And no one cared.
[01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:05.550]  Because in their lifetimes, they never had an asteroid hit them before.
[01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:09.149]  That's what a normalcy bias is.
[01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:30.210]  And most people don't have the instincts or the spirit That if they haven't experienced something themselves, they don't care about it.
[01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:33.210]  And at the heart of it, it's willful ignorance.
[01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:37.430]  And it's based in extreme selfishness.
[01:11:39.899 --> 01:11:55.640]  To where if you care about the Democrats publicly saying they're going to start a race war and drive Trump from office, or if you care about World War III that's already started, or if you care about the very same people that cooked up the last pandemic openly saying they're launching a new one and they've done it,
[01:11:56.039 --> 01:12:12.930]  and we're just waiting for the next shoe to drop, If you sit there and you take that and you put up with that, there is something wrong with you.
[01:12:14.989 --> 01:12:18.470]  But it's this selfishness that's moment to moment.
[01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:22.369]  Well, I choose not to believe that because that's scary.
[01:12:22.369 --> 01:12:23.609]  I don't want to deal with it.
[01:12:23.789 --> 01:12:25.130]  Well, you're going to deal with it.
[01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:42.529]  Like the last three years, in some areas longer, of lockdowns and masks and hurting our children and poison shots and not giving people medical care that had serious medical issues because the hospitals were too full with COVID while they were killing people in there for bounties.
[01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:51.890]  You know, I can open the phones up and just take calls from people on COVID and...
[01:12:52.829 --> 01:12:56.510]  Almost every caller had family members murdered by the hospitals or murdered by the shot.
[01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:57.510]  And you know what?
[01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.090]  I'm not man enough to do it.
[01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:05.069]  I mean, I've done it probably a hundred times, but other people just don't even do it.
[01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.010]  I'm not even man enough.
[01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:16.289]  I don't want to hear mothers and fathers and husbands and wives crying and talking about how the hospital murdered them or how the shot murdered their dad or murdered their son.
[01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:18.050]  I've had a bunch of them.
[01:13:18.069 --> 01:13:18.409]  I mean, you know what?
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.460]  I get it.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.800]  I get running away from this.
[01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:22.760]  I understand it.
[01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.560]  I understand you don't want to face it.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.220]  The problem is, not facing it is why we're in this position.
[01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:34.819]  So you know what?
[01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:37.239]  I will do the shows and take hundreds of calls from people murdered.
[01:13:38.199 --> 01:13:38.819]  You know what?
[01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:39.680]  I will cover it all.
[01:13:39.739 --> 01:13:40.659]  I'll do it all.
[01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:41.380]  I'll do it all.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.739]  And I'm not bitching or whining about it.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.539]  I'm here hyping myself up.
[01:13:45.619 --> 01:13:47.079]  I'm here saying, I'll do it.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.140]  I'll do it.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:49.619]  I'll face it.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.720]  I'll do it.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.159]  Because I know this, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.000]  And then you're going to remember the warning I got, you got, and then you're going to remember.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.600]  Go to the John Bound Report.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.760]  We'll come back and I'm going to do the show.
[01:14:00.359 --> 01:14:01.359]  Go to the John Bound Report.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:01.739]  Here it is.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.979]  On the list, I can show it to you.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.300]  Talked about it earlier.
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:10.800]  Or don't.
[01:14:11.939 --> 01:14:12.920]  It's uh...
[01:14:19.619 --> 01:14:23.199]  Coronavirus, COVID-19, the whole thing was premeditated.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.260]  It was murder.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.899]  It was active terrorism by a state against the world.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.659]  Let's call it what it is.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.060]  Here's the bad news.
[01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:47.840]  For 58 years, the United States and the UK, in collaboration with researchers around the world, planned to use coronavirus to instill the most tyrannical reform of society that this generation has ever seen.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.659]  And they did it.
[01:14:49.379 --> 01:14:53.199]  Purely premeditated to make sure that we were cowed into submission.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.319]  Do you believe the Olympics?
[01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:56.899]  Do they have the chance of becoming maybe a super spreader?
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.119]  I think that's for sure.
[01:15:00.359 --> 01:15:01.359]  1,000%.
[01:15:01.359 --> 01:15:06.979]  Peter Hotez, the mini-me of Fauci, calls for police deployment against anti-vaxxers.
[01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:08.000]  It's worse than that.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:15.359]  UN and NATO troops to take over the media, lock down martial law and force inject you under the UN treaty.
[01:15:15.949 --> 01:15:16.510]  What?
[01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:22.729]  We have some big picture stuff coming down the pike starting on January 21st.
[01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:29.810]  Mr. Bloomberg mentioned H5N1. We're seeing sporadic human cases, no human-to-human transmission yet.
[01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:30.909]  And that's just the beginning.
[01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.810]  We have another major coronavirus likely brewing in Asia.
[01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:42.329]  We've had SARS in 2002. We have a big problem with mosquito-transmitted viruses all along the Gulf Coast, where I am here in Texas.
[01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:49.800]  So we're expecting Dengue and possibly Zika virus coming back, or Apuche virus, maybe even yellow fever.
[01:15:49.939 --> 01:15:55.479]  A five-fold rise in pertussis cases, whooping cough over the last year, 15 measles outbreaks this year.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.819]  We've got polio that's been in the wastewater in New York State.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:04.060]  All that's going to come crashing down on January 21st on the Trump administration.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.560]  We need a really, really good team to be able to handle this.
[01:16:07.699 --> 01:16:10.079]  The health sector can't solve this on its own.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.930]  We're going to have to bring in Homeland Security.
[01:16:14.289 --> 01:16:16.930]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[01:16:17.409 --> 01:16:19.689]  NATO, this is a security problem.
[01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:29.369]  At least 15 federal agencies knew that gain-of-function research was being done in the Wuhan lab since, what, 2018?
[01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:35.670]  We've gotten all of our information from Whistleblower, but we now know it wasn't just one agency that China was approaching.
[01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:45.050]  China made a presentation, or an American representative, Peter Deczak, made a representation to 15 agencies about creating a virus that, guess what?
[01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:51.310]  Looks suspiciously like COVID-19 and looks like no other virus in nature from that family.
[01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:54.729]  They were working on this and presented it to 15 agencies.
[01:16:55.010 --> 01:17:02.869]  And in 2020, when they saw COVID-19, they should have all been calling and raising the alarm and saying, my goodness, we saw this two years ago.
[01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:04.409]  We knew the Chinese were doing this.
[01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:06.090]  Lo and behold, they did it.
[01:17:06.329 --> 01:17:09.050]  Bill Gates says we'll never find a coronavirus cure.
[01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:24.430]  That was in October 2020. So he's telling you take the shot, it will cure you, while separately saying in his own foundation and in the NIH that there'll never be a cure because they flooded everybody with all these cancer viruses, but there are cures.
[01:17:24.609 --> 01:17:27.050]  So it's lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:28.289]  Let's walk through it.
[01:17:28.369 --> 01:17:33.609]  It's HIV, XMRV, and SARS. It never was a coronavirus, and that's the big lie.
[01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:34.510]  Let's stop there.
[01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:42.390]  We are seeing Teenage girls or girls in their 20s presenting with stage 4 breast cancer.
[01:17:42.810 --> 01:17:48.350]  But they hid the fact from the FDA that there was a very carcinogenic substance within these vaccines.
[01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:49.689]  They continued to give them.
[01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:55.930]  And now we're seeing just an explosion of cancer, especially among young people.
[01:17:56.449 --> 01:18:06.430]  Matt Hancock, who got caught admitting that the COVID thing was all fake, it was about control, and his text messages that came out who ran the poison shot operations in the UK. More of his messages have come out.
[01:18:06.939 --> 01:18:10.760]  And now Matt Hancock is cracking jokes about Bill Gates' conspiracy.
[01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:16.359]  He joked about Bill Gates ought to be paying me a lot of money for all the people I injected with his chips.
[01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:35.109]  Well, he does own a company that does put nanochips in vaccines to track you, but what they put is self-replicating nanotech spike protein to cut off and self-replicate your DNA defense system, and then they load you with hundreds of known top cancer viruses.
[01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:38.789]  So it's far worse than a microchip.
[01:18:41.079 --> 01:18:48.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at InfoWars.
[01:18:48.399 --> 01:18:53.619]  And our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in just a few weeks.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.600]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:18:58.779 --> 01:18:59.659]  Talk about fun.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.960]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[01:19:02.119 --> 01:19:05.619]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street.
[01:19:05.789 --> 01:19:06.970]  We're at work at the Christmas party.
[01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:12.029]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:15.649]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:17.810]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:23.289]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs, TheAlexJonesStore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.289]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:28.689]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[01:19:28.909 --> 01:19:30.050]  Can you hear us now?
[01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:33.369]  And TheAlexJonesStore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[01:19:33.449 --> 01:19:35.510]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:39.069]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:19:39.369 --> 01:19:44.149]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:46.850]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.329]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:55.010]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head to the right wing of the chart?
[01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.710]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[01:19:56.869 --> 01:19:58.189]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[01:19:58.449 --> 01:20:02.069]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[01:20:02.289 --> 01:20:03.850]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:06.050]  If you're blown away by these designs, it's just a few of them.
[01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:09.210]  There's over 200 designs right now at theallshowstore.com.
[01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:11.130]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[01:20:11.329 --> 01:20:12.170]  God bless you all.
[01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:13.090]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.560]  Ho ho ho!
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.300]  Merry Christmas!
[01:20:40.739 --> 01:20:43.399]  Yeah, Texas isn't under globalist control.
[01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:50.050]  It's not under full patriot control, but it's one of the few places in the world that isn't under total New World Order domination.
[01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:55.529]  That is a wealthy place that's industrial, that is.
[01:20:55.590 --> 01:21:01.069]  There's a lot of places that aren't under total globalist control, but not a lot of electricity in those places.
[01:21:01.369 --> 01:21:02.430]  Not a lot of civilization.
[01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:05.449]  All right, let me just do this.
[01:21:06.689 --> 01:21:09.670]  I am going to go over the Disease X rollout.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.960]  And then I'm going to go into the giant military developments.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.539]  Then I'm going to go into the Daniel Perry developments.
[01:21:18.659 --> 01:21:20.159]  While that's so important.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.680]  And a horrible Supreme Court ruling.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.439]  Not on Vanderbilt.
[01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:28.220]  That was just heard last week.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.060]  This was four arguments they heard months ago.
[01:21:32.899 --> 01:21:35.819]  The so-called conservative Supreme Court said the government...
[01:21:36.699 --> 01:21:41.359]  And private schools can secretly recruit your children and brainwash them to have their genitals cut off.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:48.279]  Supreme Court stunner, secret gender transitions at schools allowed to continue.
[01:21:50.899 --> 01:21:51.539]  So...
[01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:55.619]  There's a whole stack on that.
[01:21:55.699 --> 01:21:56.579]  Not just that story.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.880]  There's a whole disgusting, nightmarish stack...
[01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:00.770]  And I get it.
[01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:02.310]  Who wants to hear about that?
[01:22:02.449 --> 01:22:07.310]  Well, they want to just hope that you don't want to delve into it and protect the kids.
[01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:08.010]  They keep doing it.
[01:22:08.369 --> 01:22:09.449]  We have to admit it's happening.
[01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:10.149]  We have to face it.
[01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.489]  I know that's alarmist, though.
[01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:17.930]  Anybody raising the alarm are the bad guys when the enemy attacks the fortress.
[01:22:18.329 --> 01:22:20.970]  The good guys open the drawbridge at 2 a.m.
[01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:21.869]  and let the bad guys in.
[01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:23.829]  Oh, no, that's Alexander Soros.
[01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:26.550]  No, we should be alarmist.
[01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:27.810]  We should be Paul Revere's.
[01:22:28.409 --> 01:22:34.390]  And we're starting to turn the tide, but you have to face how bad it is if we're going to win.
[01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:36.470]  And I'm done saying that, but that's the key.
[01:22:37.029 --> 01:22:39.029]  And still a lot of people don't get it.
[01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:42.170]  All right.
[01:22:43.909 --> 01:22:53.869]  So, just as Fauci said right when Trump got in office, Hotez said last week, and a bunch of other globalists, and Bill Gates, don't worry, the new disease X will keep us in control.
[01:22:58.289 --> 01:23:00.670]  And that's what this is about, being held hostage by these people.
[01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:05.029]  So, here's three stacks, actually four stacks.
[01:23:05.109 --> 01:23:06.069]  Let me just go over them here.
[01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:15.689]  Here comes the disease X. A mysterious illness in the Democrat Republic of Congo has been dubbed disease X. Oh, yeah.
[01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.770]  The U.N. always said that it would come, wouldn't it?
[01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:32.649]  There have been over 400 cases, up to 143 deaths linked to the illness and On Sunday, the World Health Organization provided an update on Disease X, including the illness that's been reported in Hwango province.
[01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:40.670]  And now they're saying, oh my God, Disease X is going to hit you, and it's going to mess up the Trump transition.
[01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:43.810]  Oh, just like Hotez said, it'll come crashing down on us.
[01:23:45.409 --> 01:23:52.829]  NBC News, why the threat of bird flu makes this presidential transition problematic.
[01:23:54.989 --> 01:24:12.170]  And then the professor of microbiology and immunology at Well Cornell Medicine in New York City, you got to read this whole article, says, oh, it's going to be way worse,
[01:24:12.289 --> 01:24:13.069]  whatever it is.
[01:24:13.569 --> 01:24:15.649]  We don't know what it is, but it's going to be way worse.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:29.439]  Then COVID, and it's going to kill a lot more people, and we need to have lockdowns, and we need to have forced injections, and we need to have PCR testing everywhere, and we just got to have a new lockdown.
[01:24:31.579 --> 01:24:41.060]  And they don't even say why they know bird flu is going to magically mutate and jump into humans.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:45.760]  While they simultaneously say it has, but it hasn't.
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.720]  But they just say it's imminent.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:54.119]  Any minute now, it's going to come crashing down on Trump.
[01:24:56.319 --> 01:24:58.260]  But they said, don't worry, though.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.199]  The lockdowns, masks, and shots will save you.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:12.880]  And now the FDA came out two days ago and said, we're going to test all the milk and all the eggs.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.359]  You can't sell any of it.
[01:25:17.539 --> 01:25:31.680]  Until we've stuck a PCR test at it that they've turned way up so they can create a bunch of false positives and then destroy the eggs, the chickens, the milk, and the cows.
[01:25:32.039 --> 01:25:32.439]  Oh!
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.939]  If we don't get rid of half the farming, people will starve.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:43.600]  John Kerry, 2024. You're like, we don't cut off the farming, we'll starve?
[01:25:43.859 --> 01:25:49.180]  You're like saying, if the scuba diver 200 feet under doesn't turn off his air tanks, he'll drown.
[01:25:51.979 --> 01:25:53.180]  You gotta read the article.
[01:25:53.279 --> 01:25:54.819]  It's the same article over and over again.
[01:25:54.819 --> 01:25:55.600]  It's the same crap.
[01:25:56.969 --> 01:26:18.789]  Meanwhile, breaking in an unprecedented move, more than 75 Nobel Prize winners have signed a letter urging senators not to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said to the Department of Health and Human Services, it's the first time in history that Nobel laureates have come together to oppose a cabinet choice.
[01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:22.569]  Nobel was the inventor of dynamite.
[01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:25.210]  The entire...
[01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:27.989]  Nobel Prize thing is a joke.
[01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:30.449]  You don't want one.
[01:26:30.909 --> 01:26:36.029]  Obama got the Peace Prize and then started six wars in the Arab Spring.
[01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:42.689]  So that's an endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. You want these scumbags saying he's bad.
[01:26:42.789 --> 01:26:43.710]  That shows you he's good.
[01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:47.810]  Nobel laureates oppose RFK Jr.'s confirmation.
[01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:56.149]  It's like the 147 former intelligence heads say the Hunter Biden laptop isn't real and Trump's a Russian.
[01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:59.729]  No, you're the criminals, you're the liars.
[01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.670]  And here it comes.
[01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:10.520]  California officials investigating possible new bird flu case in a child.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.000]  It's always possible.
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.539]  And then, oh, well, the PCR test said it was, but it's not.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.260]  It's always the same every day, but now it's a crescendo.
[01:27:19.659 --> 01:27:23.020]  Oh my gosh, Australia, kill the chickens, kill the cows.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.239]  It's already started there.
[01:27:24.319 --> 01:27:25.899]  Oh my God, the PCR test.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.779]  And we have the inventor of the PCR test saying, oh, remember again, it doesn't work.
[01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:35.119]  Even if it's set right, most of the time it's not accurate, but you turn it up, it's going to say anything as that.
[01:27:37.539 --> 01:27:39.039]  New bird flu cases in Kansas.
[01:27:39.239 --> 01:27:42.100]  Experts share what not to do.
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.159]  Oh no!
[01:27:44.279 --> 01:27:50.479]  USDA announces new federal order begins nationwide milk testing strategy to address H5N1 in dairy herds.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:58.140]  Arizona confirms two avian flu infections as California probes second potential case in a child.
[01:28:00.619 --> 01:28:01.979]  HPAI in livestock.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:11.880]  Bird flu claims 12% of egg supply for major national processor.
[01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:26.699]  Minnesota-based Michael Foods has lost 12% of its egg supply after millions of egg-laying chickens were exposed to avian influenza and euthanized in a contracted facility in Iowa, according to the parent company.
[01:28:27.479 --> 01:28:29.479]  Oh, PCR test says it's sick.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.239]  They'll kill it.
[01:28:31.899 --> 01:28:35.539]  San Francisco shoppers are scrambling to find eggs amid the shortage.
[01:28:37.409 --> 01:28:45.069]  And it's just like, oh, COVID killed, you know, 80-plus million people in four years of starvation.
[01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:46.510]  No, the lockdowns did.
[01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:55.270]  APAI detected in post-holdings flock.
[01:28:56.229 --> 01:29:01.710]  Department of Conversation investigates suspected bird flu cases in Missouri.
[01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.850]  Oh, no, they're everywhere, the birds.
[01:29:04.909 --> 01:29:08.659]  Like Walter Hitchcock's Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:12.199]  Why hasn't the bird flu pandemic started?
[01:29:13.159 --> 01:29:13.600]  Science.
[01:29:14.939 --> 01:29:15.380]  Magazine.
[01:29:16.619 --> 01:29:18.079]  Oh, but don't worry, it will.
[01:29:18.279 --> 01:29:19.739]  Just as soon as Trump gets in.
[01:29:20.899 --> 01:29:24.880]  And then we've got monkeypox they tried to launch three years ago, and again this year.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.479]  Maybe we shouldn't go to school in New York.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.119]  Monkeypox.
[01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:29.960]  Why, we've got 100 cases in New York.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.739]  And every case was...
[01:29:34.459 --> 01:29:37.140]  Men ingesting orally feces.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.399]  Mpox.
[01:29:45.359 --> 01:29:47.680]  First, monkeypox, it's the same thing.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.439]  But while that doesn't scare them, we already said monkeypox.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.420]  So say Mpox.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.140]  Change the name.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.319]  Detected in new regions.
[01:29:53.319 --> 01:29:55.340]  A Mayo Clinic expert explains.
[01:29:56.319 --> 01:29:57.659]  So they've got all that.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.020]  Going full tilt, buggy.
[01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:10.390]  And remember what Biden and all of them said even before they got into office.
[01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:17.989]  They said, we need more testing, more PCR, more fear, more people got COVID. Oh, you've had five COVID shots, but it says you got COVID again.
[01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:23.649]  Because if you take it, you can't get COVID and you can't spread it.
[01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:29.170]  That's what Biden said and Pelosi said and Rachel Maddow said and Fauci said.
[01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:33.250]  And it's like, well, 96% efficacy.
[01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:35.850]  84% efficacy.
[01:30:39.289 --> 01:30:43.930]  62%, 59%, 48%, it's 44% effective.
[01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.569]  Well, it actually doesn't work, and it actually erases your immune systems.
[01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:57.029]  Next, Africa Disease X invokes fears of a COVID-like pandemic, Bloomberg.
[01:30:57.529 --> 01:30:58.670]  Oh, no.
[01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:09.170]  Mystery, deadly disease X spreads in Congo as who struggles to trace the origin.
[01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:12.789]  Almost every time it's the UN injecting people with crap.
[01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:13.829]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:19.729]  Look into UN caught adding sterilant to tetanus shots in Africa.
[01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:25.630]  Or look up majority of new polio cases caused by the vaccine.
[01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:27.149]  Reuters.
[01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:28.270]  I mean, you already know about all this.
[01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:35.109]  Disease X outbreak in Congo kills more children as health officials reveal risk level for America.
[01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:39.750]  What did Hotez say last week?
[01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:48.270]  January 21st comes crashing in on you, on Trump.
[01:31:52.729 --> 01:32:04.609]  Unveiling the mystery in the DRC's disease outbreak, Is It Disease X? Which is the big one the UN says is coming that's going to kill everyone in mass.
[01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:08.750]  Before I get into that, I forgot to read the NBC article.
[01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:11.449]  I've already read it a bunch.
[01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:13.010]  There's a bunch of them that are like that in here.
[01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:20.109]  I want you to actually hear them.
[01:32:21.819 --> 01:32:26.380]  I want you to actually hear this for yourself instead of me just telling you.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.539]  Listen to this, okay?
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:34.579]  Listen to the attempt to terrorize you.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:45.819]  I'm saying they're getting ready to terrorize us into forced shots, lockdowns, tyranny, further global collapse, political control, in their own words, crashing in on us.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.180]  So don't be afraid.
[01:32:49.069 --> 01:32:51.310]  Get your immune system boosted and things like that.
[01:32:51.449 --> 01:32:55.850]  And warn everybody you know ahead of this show, we don't go under their spell again.
[01:32:58.470 --> 01:33:01.310]  Oh, Alex Jones is fear-mongering about disease X again.
[01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:02.710]  No, they're fear-mongering.
[01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:04.050]  They're saying they're taking over with it.
[01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:07.050]  I'm saying the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
[01:33:09.949 --> 01:33:13.949]  Why the threat of bird flu makes this presidential transition problematic.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.340]  The next few years could see a disastrous confluence of events.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:29.279]  The emergence of a lethal bird flu pandemic at a time when the nation's public health leadership team is ill-equipped to deal with the consequences.
[01:33:29.439 --> 01:33:33.039]  Translation, people don't trust them anymore because they're known psychotic liars who are part of a death cult.
[01:33:33.819 --> 01:33:35.859]  What could possibly go wrong, they continue.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:44.779]  To be clear, there is no certainty the world will face H5N1. They know they've bragged a little too much and called these before.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:51.699]  But Hotez and Fauci haven't been as slick.
[01:33:52.939 --> 01:33:54.359]  To be clear...
[01:33:56.349 --> 01:34:06.430]  To be clear, there is no certainty the world will face an H5N1 avian influenza bird flu pandemic next year or at any future time.
[01:34:07.569 --> 01:34:16.010]  There are significant genetic barriers involved in the adaptation of the avian virus to high-level replication in humans, but...
[01:34:17.069 --> 01:34:25.350]  It would be highly imprudent to ignore the possibility of a pandemic with terrible consequences to America and indeed the world.
[01:34:26.449 --> 01:34:28.550]  Other writers share these concerns.
[01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.029]  And let me go to the rest of the fear-mongering.
[01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:35.449]  And of course, this one is nothing compared to the others, but this is the one you got to watch.
[01:34:35.529 --> 01:34:35.970]  I'll explain why.
[01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:50.149]  Is anybody asking why they keep hyping how bird flu airborne to humans will kill the most of us and will finally depopulate us and will bring in world government for the survivors in all their globalist literature?
[01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:56.590]  Fauci, oh, the bird flu will be much worse than COVID. That will teach you to take your shots.
[01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:19.340]  These governments and corporations have been weaponizing gain-of-functioning accelerated controlled evolution Of these, and on record they got a bunch of weaponized versions of it on the shelf, so they're simply hyping it and cutting off food supply and getting their people in place before they release...
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.380]  A chimeric, synthetic, souped-up version they admit they have on the shelf.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:36.260]  That's really what this is, is do what we say politically to any other political opposition that's smart, or we're going to release this.
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:37.699]  That's really the message.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.439]  That's the political, biological weapon gun.
[01:35:41.539 --> 01:35:49.560]  Just like the EU a decade ago, when France and others were trying to vote to leave the EU, the head of the EU Commission, unelected, said...
[01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:51.289]  We'll just start a war.
[01:35:51.970 --> 01:35:53.649]  We'll just have World War III with Russia.
[01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:57.930]  Because they can start one anytime they want through one of their member nations.
[01:35:58.489 --> 01:36:00.750]  So, sit down and shut up!
[01:36:02.409 --> 01:36:08.750]  Or you'll have a radioactive future.
[01:36:11.409 --> 01:36:15.149]  So, and that's where we are now.
[01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:18.210]  Now here's where it gets nasty.
[01:36:20.409 --> 01:36:24.609]  Hundreds of vials of deadly viruses missing after lab breach.
[01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:26.170]  It's just everywhere.
[01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:26.850]  That's today.
[01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:29.609]  They just flip a switch.
[01:36:29.789 --> 01:36:39.850]  In fact, find that Simpsons show from like 17 years ago, the cat flu pandemic, where they're planning their next pandemic.
[01:36:39.909 --> 01:36:42.850]  They go, well, we owe it to the public not to just have a fake scare.
[01:36:42.949 --> 01:36:44.130]  Let's release a real virus.
[01:36:44.569 --> 01:36:46.869]  They're just laughing at you.
[01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:52.609]  Why the threat of bird flu makes the presidential transition problematic.
[01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:55.689]  So, here's again the fear-mongering.
[01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:57.630]  Because they got it on the shelf.
[01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:58.529]  It's not an idle threat.
[01:36:59.789 --> 01:37:11.310]  An H5N1 influenza outbreak in humans could be orders of magnitude more lethal than SARS-CoV-2, a virus that killed over a million people in the U.S. No, their procedures did.
[01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:23.649]  Moreover, influenza viruses, once adapted to a new host, in this case humans, are usually highly transmissible, so the rate of spread across the nation could be quick.
[01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:29.130]  For decades now, infectious disease scientists have been worried about new influenza pandemic.
[01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.529]  That's why they're cooking up more deadly ones.
[01:37:30.989 --> 01:37:42.930]  Indeed, modeling sciences and scenarios in the decades before 2020 were typically based on influenza viruses, not a coronavirus, but the globals were actually obsessed with corona.
[01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:53.289]  An H5N1 influenza outbreak in humans could be orders of magnitude more lethal than SARS-CoV-2, a virus that killed over a million people in the US alone.
[01:37:53.529 --> 01:38:04.890]  The H5N1 virus that's infecting multiple bird species worldwide and is increasingly spreading in the nation's cattle herds can be transmitted to humans, but only sporadically at present.
[01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:06.649]  That's not even true.
[01:38:06.829 --> 01:38:07.949]  It's fake diagnoses.
[01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:08.630]  That's all come out.
[01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:19.319]  As of writing, there have been 58 cases of human infections identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Prevention.
[01:38:19.319 --> 01:38:20.560]  That means a PCR test set.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:29.140]  These American cases have mostly been tracked back to contacts with chickens or birds and, more recently, cattle on farms.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:33.060]  The human infections have only rarely been severe.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.720]  Remember, you will eat the bugs.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.859]  You're not going to have that beef anymore.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:39:03.380]  But more than avian virus spreads, the more likely it is that key genetic changes will take place that enable the virus to replicate to high and dangerous levels in humans and be spread directly from one person to another.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.939]  At that point, a pandemic could be quite likely.
[01:39:08.619 --> 01:39:14.819]  But they go on to say, stop Robert F. Kennedy Jr., listen to us, take your vaccines, and you'll be fine.
[01:39:17.769 --> 01:39:18.289]  Alright?
[01:39:18.289 --> 01:39:21.489]  So, they are hyping all of this.
[01:39:21.569 --> 01:39:22.869]  They're rolling all of this out.
[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:30.670]  And they're making their move.
[01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:38.800]  And they're cult members that love being on their 12th booster and Love staying at home and think it's free.
[01:39:39.119 --> 01:39:43.560]  They can watch Netflix while the real economy is destroyed and their whole future is annihilated.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:40:01.140]  And while their journey towards being a totally useless, domesticated creature is completed, they can't wait to put the mask back on and make the kids wear the mask and take the shots and PCR tests and run around in fear monger.
[01:40:01.909 --> 01:40:14.130]  And a lot of the hospital workers can't wait to kick all the other patients out and anybody that's really sick and not give them health care and then get all that extra overtime money to tie people up and run tubes down their throats and turn them up five times higher than they're supposed to be and blow their lungs out.
[01:40:17.289 --> 01:40:21.310]  COVID was just the beta test for what the bad guys are getting ready to pull.
[01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:28.000]  And so we should have a discussion What are we going to do?
[01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:29.319]  Well, we contact lawmakers.
[01:40:29.699 --> 01:40:31.960]  We get Rand Paul speaking about this.
[01:40:32.079 --> 01:40:33.399]  We get Trump speaking about it.
[01:40:33.939 --> 01:40:35.579]  We get policy announcements.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.380]  We challenge the PCR test.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.600]  We keep pointing out how poisonous the so-called last vaccines were.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:55.930]  And we do not comply with And as this drumbeat accelerates, we start protesting and demonstrating like we did day one during the lockdowns four and a half years ago.
[01:40:58.409 --> 01:41:00.689]  Gosh, it's five years ago now.
[01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:02.689]  And we don't go along with it.
[01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:03.310]  It's that simple.
[01:41:03.729 --> 01:41:09.270]  And the good news is the UN admits that the WF admits that they got big studies.
[01:41:09.689 --> 01:41:20.779]  No one is more untrusted than the corporate media, the medical establishment, and the Congress and these other governments.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:30.539]  And I've got an example of that I'm going to get into that's a larger message to the globalists.
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:45.619]  Let me start the next hour how that ties into the assassination of the big insurance company CEO and now the arrest of the individual who's been charged with the murder and his manifesto.
[01:41:47.970 --> 01:42:09.310]  And how most people are celebrating the killing of the CEO. The CEOs of these insurance companies are choir boys compared to the big medical group heads and the big pharma makers.
[01:42:09.489 --> 01:42:10.770]  I mean, they're the king villains.
[01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:16.250]  The insurance companies are just little satanic demons that sit on their knee and it's all owned by the same people anyways.
[01:42:17.399 --> 01:42:20.340]  But yeah, people are celebrating that everywhere.
[01:42:21.659 --> 01:42:22.779]  That's all over the news.
[01:42:23.079 --> 01:42:24.340]  I'll cover it next hour.
[01:42:24.739 --> 01:42:26.659]  Just like there are weather weapons.
[01:42:26.659 --> 01:42:29.600]  We don't know weather weapons we're using in North Carolina and other areas.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:30.699]  Looks like they were manipulated.
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.739]  But the general public said, no, FEMA's behind it.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:34.279]  The government did it.
[01:42:34.319 --> 01:42:34.840]  You're murderers.
[01:42:36.479 --> 01:42:38.439]  Because people know the government's bad.
[01:42:39.939 --> 01:42:44.380]  So people are, I mean, the vast majority, I've got the articles right here, are celebrating his execution.
[01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:47.350]  The people blame the government for the hurricane.
[01:42:47.569 --> 01:42:52.569]  And so that's the message to Fauci and Hotez and Bill Gates and everybody.
[01:42:52.810 --> 01:43:00.029]  If you think you're going to get away with all this crap, this time, you probably won't get away with what you already did.
[01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.909]  You're already in big trouble.
[01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:03.270]  You're having to get pardons and stuff ready.
[01:43:04.649 --> 01:43:05.090]  So...
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:16.539]  But it's apparent that they're trying to create the scare again and trying to do all of it again and roll out even more deadly shots.
[01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:20.760]  So...
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:25.819]  It's amazing.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.960]  Alright, we're going to start the next hour.
[01:43:28.399 --> 01:43:31.180]  I'm going to finish up on that and then get into the military news.
[01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:32.699]  It's huge.
[01:43:32.939 --> 01:43:35.239]  And then into the transgender cult news.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:36.359]  Big developments there.
[01:43:37.359 --> 01:43:38.119]  And a lot more.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.279]  Please remember, I can't do this without you.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.199]  I try to make it easy to support the broadcast.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:48.199]  There are some new incredible products at the alexjohnestore.com.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:49.859]  Concentrated gummies.
[01:43:51.819 --> 01:43:59.300]  Iron and vitamin C. A super formula with organic vitamin C and high quality iron.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.520]  So many great health effects.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.340]  These are great for adults, children, old people, everybody.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.500]  Particularly, you know, women.
[01:44:07.159 --> 01:44:13.239]  And then, of course, Ultimate Turmeric is a private label of a top company with the highest ratings.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:22.279]  This is a gummy, and it's got concentrated turmeric, and then it's got a bunch of other amazing compounds in it as well.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:25.979]  Ginger root concentrate and black pepper concentrate.
[01:44:26.779 --> 01:44:28.340]  Talk about immune system boost.
[01:44:28.439 --> 01:44:29.619]  Talk about inflammation attack.
[01:44:29.819 --> 01:44:31.699]  Talk about countering cancer.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:42.720]  Those products are now available with a huge Christmas sale at thealichonstore.com.
[01:44:43.039 --> 01:44:46.439]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.539]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.000]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:44:53.439 --> 01:44:56.600]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:44:56.979 --> 01:44:59.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.619]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:45:02.079 --> 01:45:08.100]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:45:08.539 --> 01:45:11.399]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.800]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:13.899]  We're going to get behind.
[01:45:14.079 --> 01:45:17.340]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:45:17.539 --> 01:45:19.079]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:45:19.210 --> 01:45:23.350]  We're going to be very transparent to American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:45:23.489 --> 01:45:24.829]  Again, by design.
[01:45:24.989 --> 01:45:26.489]  And so much more is happening.
[01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:27.529]  This is an exciting time.
[01:45:27.789 --> 01:45:29.710]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:45:29.850 --> 01:45:33.810]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:45:33.909 --> 01:45:35.770]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:36.750]  So we make it easy.

[01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:57.949]  And I personally love this one.
[01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:01.649]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:46:01.829 --> 01:46:04.109]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:05.430]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:07.550]  And this will horrify me.
[01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:12.989]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking in fear when you're walking on the street, saying, it's okay.
[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:18.090]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:46:18.569 --> 01:46:24.710]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.

[01:47:52.869 --> 01:47:56.970]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.

[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.500]  It's an exciting time to be alive.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.239]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:48:27.439 --> 01:48:29.720]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with the fight.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.960]  God bless and good luck.
[01:48:31.439 --> 01:48:32.619]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.500]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.560]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:42.239]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:51.220]  This is why we are seeing globally these events unravel and unfold in some cases, whether it's a coup in Romania.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.819]  We actually had one in the Republic of Korea.
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:07.760]  We have this incredible rapid movement of the Islamists in Syria to topple Assad, longstanding leader of Syria.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:17.050]  So all of these things that are happening The 100,000-foot level is really this new Middle East that is taking shape.
[01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:22.210]  I would say that we need to really start paying attention to what's happening inside of Iran.
[01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:34.939]  I have heard from some friends over in Europe About some potential leadership changes that might occur there, but these people have to get on the ground first.
[01:49:35.159 --> 01:49:40.600]  Whether they operate from the Central Asian republics or they operate from Turkey, who knows?
[01:49:40.859 --> 01:49:47.539]  These are the kinds of things that are going to start to take effect and the consequences of the things that we're facing.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:56.600]  Now, I will tell you that everything that is happening in Syria is directly connected to the things happening Across Eastern Europe and certainly Russia.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.939]  The one thing that I will remind people of is because there's not a lot of conversations about China.
[01:50:03.239 --> 01:50:11.539]  On the backside of all this, Alex, and to your great audience, is the CCP. China is the big influencer here.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.380]  China is the big threat here.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:18.539]  China is the nation state that is fomenting much of this.
[01:50:18.819 --> 01:50:27.659]  And obviously they're able to do it from a position of You know, staying out of it, you know, from a media perspective, right?
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.020]  Nobody's talking about China.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:44.760]  While we are so distracted with what's going on in the Middle East and what's going on in Eastern Europe, China has been infiltrating into our system for decades, but China is taking a huge leap into places like the Caribbean,
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.760]  Cuba, and many of the Caribbean islands.
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:55.880]  The embassies that they're building in some of these countries, they have formed an alliance in South America and Central America with certain countries.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:02.560]  Eighty to ninety percent of the ports, the largest ports in our hemisphere, the Chinese either own or they control.
[01:51:02.819 --> 01:51:05.319]  And they have an alliance with different countries down there.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.680]  Of course, Brazil, Bolivia and others.
[01:51:07.979 --> 01:51:22.800]  And one of the areas that I'm always concerned about, I always highlight To your audience, there's the Panama Canal, because 70% of our trade, as well as our military capabilities, have to use probably the most strategic waterway for the United States of America in the world, bar none.
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:42.380]  So I don't want us to be overly distracted by what's going on, and that's exactly what the Biden, Harris, Obama, What Cabal is attempting to do is to drive us toward a war that has consequences that we cannot imagine just yet,
[01:51:43.039 --> 01:51:51.239]  and never mind the exchange of nuclear-capable weapons systems between Ukraine and Russia, never mind the fall of Assad.
[01:51:51.819 --> 01:51:57.619]  I want people to understand that we have elements of Iran involved and still have all this, China.
[01:51:58.429 --> 01:52:03.109]  Another country that hasn't gotten a lot of play is North Korea.
[01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:04.369]  North Korea.
[01:52:04.689 --> 01:52:11.090]  And there are things that are happening that were happening in Syria that the North Koreans were involved in.
[01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:13.829]  So there's so much at stake right now.
[01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:21.770]  And when we talk about it, we're in World War III. I don't want anybody to think that there's this regional conflict in Europe.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:27.020]  That can be handled locally or this regional conflict in the Middle East that can be handled by Israel.
[01:52:27.739 --> 01:52:36.380]  CENTCOM, Central Command out of Tampa, just conducted, I think it was 200 strikes, if I got my numbers right, in the last 48 hours inside of Syria.
[01:52:36.619 --> 01:52:44.060]  So anybody that thinks we're not at war, and we're not, and we're talking, we're talking some of our largest, most capable Air Force platforms.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.619]  We're talking B-52s.
[01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:52.289]  Stay engaged, everybody, and stay paying attention to what is happening because it's all connected.
[01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:53.869]  It is absolutely all connected.
[01:52:54.069 --> 01:53:03.449]  And the big 100,000-foot level is that the outgoing administration wants to turn over to this administration a war.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:13.659]  So they cannot execute the America First agenda that Trump won in such a huge mandate on during this last presidential election.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.260]  So thanks for allowing me to have a little bit of time with your great audience, Alex.
[01:53:16.579 --> 01:53:19.560]  And let's just keep paying attention to what's happening.
[01:53:33.930 --> 01:54:03.970]  Luigi Mangione the heir to a big fortune family works with the Pelosi's goes and reportedly he's been charged with it kills this big insurance company CEO and then he has a manifesto basically a communism and now he just got hauled into the police station there in New York screaming and yelling at people we'll play that in a moment But within this story is something
[01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:04.810]  a lot bigger.
[01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:09.430]  And it's the fact that, and I got a stack of articles here.
[01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:10.430]  It's all over the news.
[01:54:10.529 --> 01:54:11.609]  You don't even tell you about it.
[01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:14.609]  It's known that the majority of people think he's a hero.
[01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:17.350]  Because they're mad at the healthcare system.
[01:54:17.489 --> 01:54:18.510]  They're mad at the cost.
[01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:19.529]  They're mad at the bad quality.
[01:54:19.649 --> 01:54:20.409]  They're mad at the shots.
[01:54:20.569 --> 01:54:21.329]  They're mad at Fauci.
[01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:24.850]  That's why Biden's having to get preemptive pardons ready for him.
[01:54:26.890 --> 01:54:28.909]  And so that's another message to the system.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.439]  But why is it a communist that reportedly killed him?
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:34.939]  Allegedly.
[01:54:35.819 --> 01:54:36.859]  Looks like it's him.
[01:54:42.779 --> 01:54:55.199]  That implies this is capitalism with big pharma and big medical and big insurance, all basically owned by BlackRock, handful of shareholders, setting up this giant fraud.
[01:54:55.199 --> 01:54:57.140]  We have some of the worst healthcare in the world.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.020]  We have the most expensive healthcare in the world.
[01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:01.550]  And they call that capitalism.
[01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:04.050]  What it is, is a giant screw job.
[01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:12.510]  And now we've got his manifesto, and he wants government healthcare, and he's like the Unabomber.
[01:55:14.729 --> 01:55:30.819]  So, take a horrible corrupt system, and then a fascist system, a kleptocratic system, and then call it capitalism, and then merge it with communism, and It'll still be private profits for the globalists, but even worse for us.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:34.100]  Rationing everything else on top of it.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  And they already beta tested that with the COVID. Oh, for over a year.
[01:55:38.119 --> 01:55:41.479]  Oh, you can't have your heart attack or your cancer taken care of or your broken leg.
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:45.140]  Oh, we're going to not resuscitate people where they settle over the world.
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.720]  Remember, you're in Australia or the US? Oh, and blue cities.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.899]  Oh, you're having a heart attack?
[01:55:50.039 --> 01:55:54.039]  We're not going to resuscitate you because the hospital is too full of COVID patients.
[01:55:54.039 --> 01:55:55.159]  It's actually empty, basically.
[01:55:56.409 --> 01:56:07.250]  To get medical workers from the EMTs to the nurses, the nurse practitioners to the doctors, the administrators to the coders to just go, okay, we don't give everybody else healthcare now.
[01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:09.529]  The opposite of the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:14.010]  Oh, but if you're an illegal alien, you still get the healthcare.
[01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:18.710]  So that was all training to become fully corrupted.
[01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:29.050]  And over 200,000 nurses and doctors fired in the U.S. alone because they wouldn't take the poison shots, and that was all illegal, and they're winning their court cases, and that's good.
[01:56:30.949 --> 01:56:32.750]  But they're going to try it again.
[01:56:33.409 --> 01:56:35.529]  And this is a place we've done a great job.
[01:56:35.630 --> 01:56:40.350]  We did a terrible job up front as a Western world, buying into the hype, the mind control.
[01:56:41.439 --> 01:56:50.720]  The hysteria, letting them for years put our kids in masks, destroying their development, causing massive suicide, incredible levels of bacterial pneumonia from the mask, on and on and on.
[01:56:51.239 --> 01:56:54.539]  But we lost the game the first three quarters.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.399]  We won in the fourth.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.640]  People finally got pissed.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.699]  They woke up.
[01:56:57.819 --> 01:57:07.460]  That hardcore of good scientists and medical workers and doctors and researchers and talk show hosts and lawmakers like them.
[01:57:10.119 --> 01:57:16.340]  Surgeon General of Florida, who's super on target, and the new NIH head, Trump's bringing in, who was super on target.
[01:57:16.939 --> 01:57:24.739]  They spoke up, you spoke up, we spoke up, and saved a lot of lives, exposing it to where they have less than 4% uptake of their new shots.
[01:57:25.479 --> 01:57:34.960]  And they had the lowest levels since so-called vaccines came out in the last 90 years of people taking any of these shots, because people don't trust them now.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:39.260]  And they go, oh, you're all going to die because you didn't take your shots.
[01:57:42.369 --> 01:57:44.369]  And they go, look at all these people dying.
[01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.810]  We don't know why they're dying.
[01:57:45.949 --> 01:57:47.390]  It turns out they're all vaccinated.
[01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:51.409]  Major studies out of England last week.
[01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.670]  Oxford.
[01:57:54.609 --> 01:57:55.090]  Harvard.
[01:57:56.170 --> 01:57:57.109]  Government study.
[01:57:57.569 --> 01:57:58.210]  Government database.
[01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:06.029]  All of the 1.7 million kids with the heart attacks and all of it from the shots.
[01:58:08.489 --> 01:58:13.670]  How many kids died of COVID in the UK? I mean, a kid had cancer, a kid had deformities, comorbidity.
[01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:14.909]  They'd still say COVID did it, but no.
[01:58:15.329 --> 01:58:15.930]  A few hundred?
[01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:20.069]  Now you got millions sick and dying?
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:22.029]  I mean, this is admitted.
[01:58:25.449 --> 01:58:28.850]  So yeah, I'm pissed off at the globalist.
[01:58:28.930 --> 01:58:34.590]  I'm not saying you should go kill Fauci because that would turn him into a victim.
[01:58:36.029 --> 01:58:43.109]  Turns out he gets $15 million a year of illegal federal protection even after he's out of government.
[01:58:44.569 --> 01:58:53.449]  He has 12 federal marshals 24 hours a day.
[01:58:59.909 --> 01:59:01.850]  He's the definition of the deep state.
[01:59:02.090 --> 01:59:04.569]  Been there for 46 years in government.
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:08.859]  Still in control of a lot of policy, even though he's supposedly out of the government.
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:12.460]  And it goes on and on.
[01:59:21.979 --> 01:59:38.470]  So, Luigi Mangione is, I guess, mad how the medical system Botched his back surgery, we're told, and he couldn't have sex anymore.
[01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:39.649]  That would make me mad too.
[01:59:41.670 --> 01:59:46.409]  And that's like if he couldn't eat anymore.
[01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:48.590]  That's one of the things of life is good.
[01:59:48.729 --> 01:59:49.369]  God gave us that.
[01:59:50.909 --> 01:59:56.590]  And no more ribeye steak, no more sex, no more looking at the stars.
[01:59:59.869 --> 02:00:02.770]  No more driving a car down a country road at 120 miles an hour?
[02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:04.390]  Doesn't sound very fun to me.
[02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:11.489]  But what is the message to the system?
[02:00:12.970 --> 02:00:14.090]  We don't like you.
[02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:29.729]  But I gotta tell you, killing the CEO of an insurance company, of a medical group, An insurance medical group.
[02:00:31.909 --> 02:00:33.550]  I mean, that's...
[02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:36.630]  That's not up at the top.
[02:00:36.869 --> 02:00:39.649]  Now, this guy was being investigated for insider trading.
[02:00:39.789 --> 02:00:41.609]  He was supposed to testify in two weeks.
[02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:45.289]  He was tied into Pelosi in insider trading.
[02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:46.529]  This guy's tied into Pelosi.
[02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:52.310]  He has a classic CIA, you know, like the guy that shot Reagan or the guy that shot...
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:04.619]  John Lennon, same thing, obsessed with certain passages, certain numbers, that's usually a programming sign, or it's also a sign of a schizophrenic, could just be a run-of-the-mill loon.
[02:01:05.829 --> 02:01:06.689]  But we'll never know.
[02:01:06.829 --> 02:01:10.890]  You know, Theodore Krasinski, the Unabomber, was CIA. People go, really?
[02:01:10.989 --> 02:01:13.010]  They type in, they go, wow, that's LA Times, Associated Press.
[02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:14.670]  Yeah, MKUltra.
[02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:17.989]  He wasn't just in the CIA. He was in the CIA mind control program.
[02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:25.430]  The Aurora Batman shooter was in a hyper-secret DARPA brain interface NASA program.
[02:01:29.489 --> 02:01:34.029]  So, I don't think what we're being told about this guy is true.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.359]  When we get the manifesto, it'll be what the globalists want, full government takeover of healthcare.
[02:01:39.979 --> 02:01:49.079]  But still, they'll privatize the cost to the public, but call it communist.
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:53.399]  So they'll keep the profit and the private, but give the public all the cost.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.640]  But I don't know what's going on here.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:57.739]  We don't know.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.000]  We can't believe a word we're told.
[02:02:05.819 --> 02:02:11.100]  The suspect in healthcare killing charged with murder.
[02:02:14.479 --> 02:02:20.460]  He's the heir to a fortune created by his grandparents who were big with the Pelosi's and ongoing.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:36.000]  Comes from a powerful Maryland family centered on the late patriarch A first-generation American who built a real estate empire in the state, including country clubs and the media.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.279]  Billionaires.
[02:02:46.079 --> 02:02:50.500]  So these Mangione's are pretty powerful and big with the globalists.
[02:02:53.579 --> 02:02:54.260]  Mangione.
[02:02:55.670 --> 02:03:00.050]  Is the cousin of Republican Maryland House of Delegates member Neo Mangione.
[02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:07.609]  And I got a bunch of articles about Mangione's connections to the Pelosi's.
[02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:21.109]  CEO assassin Luigi Mangione went crazy after giant screws put in his spine called insurers parasites in manifesto.
[02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:31.130]  Reviewers slam PA McDonald's after worker tip leads to arrest of CEO killing of Mangione.
[02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:40.470]  And then here's some of the news articles about the Mangione's being in business with the Pelosi's.
[02:03:41.569 --> 02:03:48.189]  Pelosi fundraiser retained by Palo Alto Networks and the Mangione's are part of that.
[02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:53.489]  Healthcare group reports critical services restored.
[02:03:55.109 --> 02:04:03.329]  After cyber attack, sure a convenient cover for them to disappear some stuff, Luigi Mangione was unable to have sex because of severe back pain.
[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:12.789]  Luigi Mangione, 286 riddle exposed as dental code, Pokemon, and Bible point to murder.
[02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:15.670]  Oh, I catch her in the rye.
[02:04:17.329 --> 02:04:22.229]  Luigi Mangione may have left subtle clue with Pokemon pic.
[02:04:24.619 --> 02:04:27.220]  What is the Luigi Mangione 286 conspiracy?
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:33.579]  So, the globalists are in trouble.
[02:04:33.739 --> 02:04:35.020]  People are coming after them everywhere.
[02:04:37.119 --> 02:04:44.079]  This could just be a crazy, with all the things you got involved here, I would tend to say it's not.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:46.460]  It's a wind-up toy.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:47.779]  It's a mind-control assassin.
[02:04:48.399 --> 02:04:49.560]  That's a real thing.
[02:04:52.399 --> 02:04:57.439]  Lee Harvey Oswald worked for the CIA. Ian Obama worked for the CIA in mind control.
[02:04:58.479 --> 02:04:59.680]  BNMK Ultra, look it up.
[02:05:01.239 --> 02:05:03.159]  McVeigh worked in secret operations.
[02:05:03.159 --> 02:05:03.859]  That came out.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:10.060]  Charlie Manson worked for the CIA. That came out.
[02:05:10.319 --> 02:05:11.899]  I mean, I can just go on down the line.
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.180]  So when you've seen these, everything, when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[02:05:17.619 --> 02:05:19.159]  I'm not saying that.
[02:05:19.579 --> 02:05:21.920]  I'm just saying that should be investigated.
[02:05:24.570 --> 02:05:27.390]  Now, the globalists don't want us angry at them.
[02:05:27.649 --> 02:05:29.689]  The globalists don't want us angry at Fauci.
[02:05:30.529 --> 02:05:32.569]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[02:05:32.909 --> 02:05:44.050]  And they've said they want to trigger racial division and conflict and that Trump is coming to kill blacks and Hispanics with no evidence of that when he gets in office with Tom Homa.
[02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:48.689]  And then mayors say we're going to rise up and governors say they're going to rise up and Democrats say they're going to have...
[02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:50.930]  Blue states and cities secede.
[02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.630]  That's all official.
[02:05:51.789 --> 02:05:54.369]  I've already gone over all that ad nauseum, shown all the videos and documents.
[02:05:54.569 --> 02:05:55.449]  Just recapping.
[02:05:57.050 --> 02:06:00.609]  And that's their plan if World War III doesn't stop Trump.
[02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:18.010]  They are going to do false flags against Democrat protesters protesting, Border Patrol arresting and rounding up illegals.
[02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:21.890]  They've said that's what's going to get Trump.
[02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:22.670]  That's going to stop Trump.
[02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:23.390]  That's what we're going to do.
[02:06:23.710 --> 02:06:24.909]  And then they started doing it.
[02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:33.350]  And then they used the Daniel Perry case with the Soros Democrat-funded Black Lives Matter who get paid to do what they do.
[02:06:33.529 --> 02:06:39.670]  When they go out and riot and burn stuff, the cities apologize later, give them tens of millions of dollars per city to pay for the next event.
[02:06:41.770 --> 02:06:46.350]  And the national media gives it attention to divide white people and black people.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:07:06.579]  As the slow burn or the lighting the fuse, the preparatory phase, preparing the ground, or when Trump gets in in 40 days and then Homa starts going out, So they can then have one of their operatives or another lined up toy.
[02:07:07.539 --> 02:07:14.680]  Crazy, go out and machine gun a bunch of Democrat protesters, migrants, something like that.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:20.340]  And then that's the trigger for the secession and the uprisings and having the military turn against Trump.
[02:07:21.479 --> 02:07:22.979]  You say the military loves Trump.
[02:07:23.119 --> 02:07:24.760]  Yeah, the rank and file, not the leadership.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:25.899]  They're basically all globalists.
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:30.600]  And they've said that's how they're going to do it.
[02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:35.970]  John Podesta, Carble, all of them.
[02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:41.729]  And so we need to see through that.
[02:07:41.869 --> 02:07:43.149]  We need to talk about that.
[02:07:45.789 --> 02:07:52.649]  You've got Black Lives Matter, whether they're in New York or D.C. or San Francisco.
[02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:55.369]  I've watched a bunch of their press conferences.
[02:07:55.689 --> 02:07:56.689]  You've seen it everywhere.
[02:07:56.850 --> 02:07:57.649]  Do you really need me to play it?
[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:01.199]  Saying, you know, white people are killing us.
[02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:02.420]  We've got to get up and have an uprising.
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:03.079]  We've got to get them.
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:03.800]  Well, what did Carvel say?
[02:08:04.239 --> 02:08:05.260]  Trump's coming to kill you.
[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:06.520]  His supporters are coming to kill you.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:08.460]  You've got to have armed uprisings.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:09.819]  Well, these guys are reading scripts.
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:15.699]  And they're being paid to do it, a lot of money.
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:21.140]  And notice what they say.
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:26.859]  They say, this weekend, we need big black gatherings in the cities.
[02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:30.310]  So we can decide what we're going to do.
[02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:33.510]  So he just said, let's have a violent uprising.
[02:08:33.689 --> 02:08:34.430]  Let's target white people.
[02:08:35.050 --> 02:08:38.770]  And so he then says, because he's been given a script.
[02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:41.489]  Now, our lawyers keep you out of jail if you just say this much.
[02:08:41.609 --> 02:08:46.090]  But then when you say organize the group to carry out the violence, don't connect the two.
[02:08:46.170 --> 02:08:47.829]  Just say, we got to get together and talk.
[02:08:48.770 --> 02:09:11.430]  So he and others can then get up and Antifa can show up, which has come out in the documents, and try to stir up a black crowd of young people at 10 o'clock at night in Baltimore or D.C. or New York or Houston or Chicago to try to get them to start burning stuff down.
[02:09:13.890 --> 02:09:15.210]  And then when they're successful...
[02:09:17.659 --> 02:09:20.960]  Well, the police will later have a settlement with them to give them even more money.
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:24.020]  But not to the people that burn stuff down and go to jail.
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:25.899]  No, to the leaders that went and did it.
[02:09:26.659 --> 02:09:28.979]  You remember like Denver, 25 million.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.520]  New York, 37 million.
[02:09:30.579 --> 02:09:31.359]  I mean, I forget the exact number.
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:32.340]  San Francisco, 20 million.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:33.380]  I mean, look it up.
[02:09:33.659 --> 02:09:34.500]  Guys, look up.
[02:09:34.899 --> 02:09:35.760]  Just the headline.
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:44.789]  Major cities do cash payouts to BLM. They go out and burn everything down.
[02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:47.409]  CNN calls it mostly peaceful.
[02:09:48.369 --> 02:09:50.170]  In Wisconsin and everywhere else.
[02:09:50.729 --> 02:09:51.130]  Minnesota.
[02:09:53.970 --> 02:09:55.670]  Tim Walsh says it's wonderful.
[02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:58.850]  His wife says she loves the smell of the burning buildings and tires.
[02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:01.770]  They have the police stand down.
[02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:04.109]  And then later they give money for a job well done.
[02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:06.850]  That was all just a beta test for what they're about to pull.
[02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:10.750]  That was a beta test in the summer of 2020 in case Trump won.
[02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:12.229]  They were going to do it for real...
[02:10:13.779 --> 02:10:16.659]  They said to drive it out of office, John Podesta.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:21.939]  And now, Trump did get back in, but four years later, so they're going with the plan.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:26.760]  And again, you're like, yeah, you just told us this first hour, and now the third hour.
[02:10:28.039 --> 02:10:29.300]  I'm telling the new listeners.
[02:10:29.979 --> 02:10:31.000]  Because this is it.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.260]  This is going down.
[02:10:32.359 --> 02:10:33.960]  It's not me predicting it now, it's happening.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.060]  And the real victims here, and I don't say this to kiss black people's ass, I just state the way things are.
[02:10:41.659 --> 02:10:46.479]  We're all victims in this, but the black people are the biggest victim.
[02:10:46.699 --> 02:10:49.640]  You think the average black person wants to kill white people and burn stuff down?
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:51.819]  You think they want the country trashed?
[02:10:51.899 --> 02:10:52.399]  No, they don't.
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:02.920]  This is George Soros, globalist-funded, criminal scumbags doing all this and using events to hype things up.
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:06.479]  And if you think George Floyd was enough to get riots going on, or you think...
[02:11:08.779 --> 02:11:10.319]  Daniel Perry's gonna be enough.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.699]  Watch this weekend.
[02:11:11.859 --> 02:11:13.000]  I think we're gonna see some fireworks.
[02:11:13.579 --> 02:11:23.279]  Imagine when some white supremacist, quote, white supremacist, mows down a couple hundred migrants or Democrats protesting for migrants or a mix.
[02:11:23.819 --> 02:11:24.520]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:25.859 --> 02:11:26.479]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:26.539 --> 02:11:29.180]  You saw the hysteria and the tyranny out of Charlottesville.
[02:11:29.479 --> 02:11:30.960]  One person got killed there.
[02:11:31.159 --> 02:11:32.479]  This is gonna be spectacular.
[02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:40.689]  And we're just sitting here watching the fuse burn into the building of dynamite here.
[02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:47.409]  I'm like, put it out, scissors, cut the fuse, pour water on the fuse.
[02:11:48.409 --> 02:11:51.529]  I'm like, we're 40 days out from Trump.
[02:11:53.289 --> 02:11:56.529]  People are like, hey man, there's probably something else to cover.
[02:11:56.569 --> 02:11:58.550]  I'm like, World War III fuse, psst.
[02:12:00.210 --> 02:12:03.550]  Soon we'll be in World War III. We're now in World War III. Soon it'll be nuclear.
[02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:06.529]  Hey, they're hyping up new pandemics.
[02:12:06.630 --> 02:12:07.630]  Now they say it's going to happen.
[02:12:07.729 --> 02:12:08.470]  Now they say we're here.
[02:12:10.050 --> 02:12:11.829]  The lockdowns and all the rest of it.
[02:12:12.489 --> 02:12:15.050]  And I'm just about to watch that fuse go right in that dynamite.
[02:12:15.289 --> 02:12:15.970]  I mean, it's going...
[02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:17.750]  There's all these fuses burning.
[02:12:18.289 --> 02:12:22.869]  And I'm up here just watching them burn with a real sense of urgency.
[02:12:24.630 --> 02:12:29.529]  And then, oh my God, when it all happens, it'll be Alex Jones is even more incredible.
[02:12:30.619 --> 02:12:31.659]  I don't want that to happen.
[02:12:31.779 --> 02:12:32.619]  I want to stop it.
[02:12:34.619 --> 02:12:35.579]  I'm not incredible.
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:36.699]  It's out of the open.
[02:12:37.079 --> 02:12:43.779]  And that's why the Democratic Party, Bloomberg, are in there arguing with Musk lawyers yesterday in Houston saying, well, okay, we can't have his handles.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.899]  We want every bit of his content taken down.
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:50.600]  If we're able to say we own it, well, that's not our jurisdiction, his content.
[02:12:50.739 --> 02:12:52.939]  You have to talk to another court about that, but you don't own the X account.
[02:12:52.939 --> 02:12:53.560]  He'll keep that.
[02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:13.869]  They don't want this show in 50 days, 10 days after Trump's in, I'm just guessing a number, and Holman's in Denver or Chicago, and they're rounding up all these criminally legal aliens, first the really hardcore ones,
[02:13:13.949 --> 02:13:17.310]  and then somebody truck bombs them or somebody shoots a bunch of them.
[02:13:17.649 --> 02:13:19.949]  They don't want people to play this clip.
[02:13:19.949 --> 02:13:22.130]  It'll get 500 million views.
[02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:23.850]  They'll go, how the hell do you know this?
[02:13:24.909 --> 02:13:29.010]  The bad guys watch this show and they're like, that son of a bitch has got everything figured out.
[02:13:29.369 --> 02:13:31.770]  How the hell did you get him off the air?
[02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:35.869]  They're like, sir, we've already tried to put him in prison and bankrupt him.
[02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:37.510]  We need the material down.
[02:13:37.670 --> 02:13:41.329]  He's figured out that even if we kill him, it only makes the past material stronger.
[02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:45.810]  Well, say we own it and then use bots and AI to remove it.
[02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:52.149]  It's going to be horrible when we do all this and he's already called it all out down to exactly how we do it.
[02:13:55.029 --> 02:13:58.569]  First claim you own his name and all his content, then we kill him.
[02:13:59.010 --> 02:14:02.329]  But we've got to get the content off the web first.
[02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:04.630]  Don't worry, we'll kill him after that.
[02:14:05.289 --> 02:14:06.090]  Those are the discussions.
[02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:07.550]  100%.
[02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:09.510]  They got the teams ready.
[02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:11.149]  And it's not just for me.
[02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:13.510]  It's for Trump and Tucker and everybody.
[02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:16.649]  That's what you do when you take over.
[02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:18.090]  You cut the head off the opposition.
[02:14:18.729 --> 02:14:20.329]  Well, I'm going down with the ship.
[02:14:20.649 --> 02:14:22.130]  But that's why I'm so pissed.
[02:14:22.289 --> 02:14:27.470]  Because, man, I know my life and your life and our old future hangs in the balance.
[02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:30.869]  And that ain't fear-mongering, baby.
[02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:31.970]  That's the truth.
[02:14:33.369 --> 02:14:36.869]  So I'm going to come back and play the Black Lives Matter stuff and get into all the other news.
[02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:40.390]  But, man, I'm tired of being right.
[02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:41.470]  I'm serious.
[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:41.970]  I'm serious.
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:46.720]  I mean, this is...
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.979]  This is ridiculous.
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:57.060]  It's like playing Jenga or something where you know the final piece pulls out, it's going to collapse.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:59.859]  And I'm like, they pull one more piece out of there.
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:01.920]  We're already in World War III, nuclear war.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.060]  And it's like, the New Order's like jerking on the Jenga.
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:05.060]  Come on, let's do it.
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:08.000]  And I'm just sitting here going, my God, living was sure good.
[02:15:09.029 --> 02:15:10.350]  All right, we're going to come back, hit it all.
[02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:11.510]  There's so much more coming up.
[02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:12.930]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:17.670]  We've been through a lot in Infowars.
[02:15:17.949 --> 02:15:20.409]  America and the world has been through hell.
[02:15:20.630 --> 02:15:21.890]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:23.930]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:28.010]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most...
[02:15:28.739 --> 02:15:36.640]  Powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the team humanity agenda on air.
[02:15:37.319 --> 02:15:45.619]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, is owned by great Patriots and some of the top makers of Patriot apparel.
[02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:56.930]  So whatever happens to Infowars in the future, they are going to back us to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network at AJ and Live on X and at alexjones.network.

[02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:16.229]  We have two new campaign coins.
[02:16:16.369 --> 02:16:18.069]  Two different coins right here.
[02:16:18.289 --> 02:16:26.859]  One is the answer to 1984 is 1776. And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[02:16:26.859 --> 02:16:30.060]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.
[02:16:30.359 --> 02:16:42.239]  The other great coin is 1776, limited edition coin with a Gadsden flag, don't tread on me, and 1776. Both are powerful coins, powerful coins.
[02:16:43.229 --> 02:16:43.670]  Messages.
[02:16:43.670 --> 02:16:44.610]  They weigh a lot.
[02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:45.290]  They feel good.
[02:16:45.409 --> 02:16:46.129]  They're a great gift.
[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:47.969]  They're a great memento.
[02:16:48.090 --> 02:16:49.209]  They're a great keepsake.
[02:16:49.329 --> 02:16:51.250]  They're a great conversation starter.
[02:16:51.590 --> 02:16:58.370]  And both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:16:58.489 --> 02:16:59.889]  We can't do this without you.
[02:17:00.090 --> 02:17:02.530]  We want to sell you products you love so you come back again and again.
[02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:04.069]  Thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:08.090]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and get the campaign coins.
[02:17:15.129 --> 02:17:23.270]  Alright, I got some news about 20 minutes ago, and I had a chance to read it during the break.
[02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:33.809]  And I said at the start of the show, two and a half hours ago, I said the globalists have already soft-launched Operation Bluebeam.
[02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:38.229]  And if you don't know what Operation Bluebeam is, I'll get to it before the hour ends.
[02:17:40.809 --> 02:17:50.639]  But they, the bad guys, Are launching every pre-packaged, pre-prepared crisis they've had to control humanity.
[02:17:50.899 --> 02:18:02.379]  The viral pandemic scares, the World War III, the Civil War race-based conflict coup, the fake alien invasion.
[02:18:07.159 --> 02:18:08.479]  It's all going on.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:19.200]  Did you ever hear every channel, every city, UFOs just everywhere flying around, and you look at them and they're human drones, it's the damn government?
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:23.180]  So the government can declare an emergency.
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:34.879]  Now being proposed, Drones over New Jersey.
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:42.319]  Congressman Josh Gothheimer introduces new bills to address recent activity in New Jersey.
[02:18:44.879 --> 02:18:46.899]  And it's a state of emergency.
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:53.299]  Yeah, of psychological warfare.
[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:55.260]  That's coming up.
[02:18:56.739 --> 02:18:57.579]  So...
[02:19:01.819 --> 02:19:03.399]  Let me finish up with Black Lives Matter.
[02:19:04.139 --> 02:19:09.760]  You know, somebody ought to take all these Black Lives Matter people getting millions of bucks apiece, the leaders.
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:12.959]  Hell, some of them get like 20, 30 million, individually.
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:19.260]  Somebody ought to, whenever they get up and talk, take the video and stick George Soros' head on them.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.879]  Or stick Hillary Clinton's head on them.
[02:19:23.399 --> 02:19:27.959]  All those videos I heard where she's laughing like a demon, like a bobblehead.
[02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:37.690]  Because you're not looking at a black person When you're looking at those people, you're looking at a deep state CIA puppet.
[02:19:38.350 --> 02:19:39.569]  And that's all come out.
[02:19:41.250 --> 02:19:45.530]  Alexander Soros, 12 years ago we got documents that were confirmed.
[02:19:46.809 --> 02:19:54.290]  Where Soros was putting in 30-something million a year to have Antifa go around and try to get blacks to burn stuff down.
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:12.420]  So when you see these Black Lives Matter people using any case they can to try to get conflict going, so we're all fighting with each other and hating each other while the globalists come after all of us with poison shots, come after all of us with poison fluoride, come after all of us with 5G,
[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:27.280]  come after all of us with World War III, come after all of us with inflation, come after all of us with open borders, illegal aliens, come after all of us with fentanyl, come after all of us with the transgender death cult, Come after all of us for the Satanism.
[02:20:27.479 --> 02:20:28.700]  We're all in this together.
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:40.000]  And that doesn't mean we don't have our differences and black people done some bad stuff and white people done some bad stuff and Hispanics done some stuff.
[02:20:40.139 --> 02:20:40.379]  Whatever.
[02:20:41.629 --> 02:20:46.290]  Point is, we're not the New World Order supervillains doing 99% of the bad stuff.
[02:20:46.450 --> 02:20:50.370]  And what type of dumbasses are we to continue this infighting crap?
[02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:54.649]  When humanity's under attack, our children are under attack.
[02:20:54.909 --> 02:20:56.309]  They're coming after all our children.
[02:20:56.569 --> 02:21:02.069]  Hell, one of the 10 planks of the Black Lives Matter is to target black boys.
[02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:06.729]  Number one, to make them say they're a girl.
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:12.360]  And that they'll be accepted in society if they talk and act like a woman.
[02:21:13.079 --> 02:21:19.319]  Last time I was in New York three years ago to go on Andrew Schultz's podcast, I was there two days.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.219]  I went in a mall.
[02:21:24.959 --> 02:21:28.879]  I went in a couple restaurants and a hotel and his studios.
[02:21:29.239 --> 02:21:30.799]  And man, it freaked me out.
[02:21:30.959 --> 02:21:33.440]  They had gay pride, which means globalist pride.
[02:21:33.819 --> 02:21:34.680]  Flags everywhere.
[02:21:35.989 --> 02:21:39.889]  And almost every black man I ran into and talked to talked just like a woman.
[02:21:41.329 --> 02:21:44.309]  And we're doing it on purpose, to be accepted.
[02:21:47.069 --> 02:21:52.549]  The waiters, the people at the stores, I forgot to bring enough clothes, I went and bought a shirt.
[02:21:56.969 --> 02:22:01.489]  And it's just, look what they've done to everybody.
[02:22:03.649 --> 02:22:05.629]  You know the number one target of abortion is black people.
[02:22:06.149 --> 02:22:09.229]  Black people are getting abused, getting brainwashed, getting poisoned.
[02:22:09.229 --> 02:22:11.590]  We all are, but they're really getting targeted.
[02:22:12.049 --> 02:22:14.510]  And man, they're starting to figure out it's the globalist.
[02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:28.139]  And they're starting to figure out that Trump actually wants everybody to be prosperous, and that's why the New World Order wants to end this right now, because the name of fighting division and racism, it's the New World Order that's come out in their own documents that is pushing it for control.
[02:22:28.139 --> 02:22:34.520]  Of course, new big studies come out, government studies they suppress, that DEI causes division and racism.
[02:22:36.799 --> 02:22:39.899]  They're not trying to get black people better jobs.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.420]  They're trying to fire white people and publicize it to make white people hate black people.
[02:22:46.979 --> 02:22:48.219]  Come on, folks.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:55.379]  They're trying to get all these other groups on the globalist team.
[02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:56.120]  Hey, join us.
[02:22:56.239 --> 02:22:56.940]  We'll give you free stuff.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:04.100]  Governor Hochul's going to send everybody in New York State checks for $300, $400, $500.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:06.819]  Oh, look, it's free money because I love you.
[02:23:06.979 --> 02:23:07.260]  Bull.
[02:23:07.559 --> 02:23:07.639]  Bull.
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:11.639]  That's like putting a piece of cheese on a mousetrap.
[02:23:11.799 --> 02:23:14.579]  Are you really giving the mouse a piece of cheese because you love it?
[02:23:14.639 --> 02:23:15.360]  No, you want to kill it.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:20.840]  Are you giving a fish a free worm when you put a worm on it?
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:21.139]  No.
[02:23:22.879 --> 02:23:28.040]  When you lay out a bear trap and put a piece of meat on it, are you really trying to give that bear a piece of steak?
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:30.040]  Trying to kill it?
[02:23:32.899 --> 02:23:34.059]  Use your heads, people.
[02:23:36.219 --> 02:23:39.079]  The New World Order isn't trying to give you anything for free.
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:40.459]  It wants your ass.
[02:23:45.399 --> 02:23:48.879]  And 2020 was a beta test in case Trump won the election.
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:52.620]  The Democrats said, for riots, a hundred times worse.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.399]  And now they say they're going to do it again.
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:02.000]  And if they get another George Floyd or another Daniel Penney or a really big event that they stage...
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:06.139]  And we haven't warned people and we haven't pointed it out.
[02:24:07.079 --> 02:24:18.559]  They got a good chance to bring in a civil war and bring us into a permanent civil emergency.
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.500]  And oh, we're going to censor everybody, including the left and right now.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.719]  We're never going to let that happen again, why the economy crashed during that.
[02:24:26.799 --> 02:24:30.920]  But thank God the UN and the central banks had a new global currency that stabilized things quickly.
[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:36.059]  Those were the troubled times, but we were able to fix it all.
[02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:45.559]  But they're only able to do that, create the crises to offer the solution to get the power and full control if people don't know what they're doing, don't know their plan.
[02:24:47.139 --> 02:24:52.840]  And I see all these other great talk show hosts talking about things I exposed 30 years ago.
[02:24:53.610 --> 02:24:54.549]  Or 10 years ago.
[02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:56.030]  And they've got pieces of it.
[02:24:56.229 --> 02:25:03.149]  But they don't have the big pieces of what's happening now and what's happening next month and where we are today and what's happening next.
[02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:06.829]  Yeah, Alex, everybody talks like you now.
[02:25:07.129 --> 02:25:09.569]  Yeah, stuff I said 30 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:13.889]  How about everybody else start talking about what I'm talking about now?
[02:25:15.809 --> 02:25:18.989]  You know, most talk shows be like, I don't want everybody talking about what I talk about.
[02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:20.610]  That's the reason I'm so popular.
[02:25:20.909 --> 02:25:22.170]  I don't want to be popular.
[02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:26.590]  I'm so popular to get my ass in prisoner killed here pretty quick.
[02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:31.030]  You think I want to take on these psychotic killers because I got a death wish?
[02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:34.969]  You think I'll fight with everything I got because I like to run around and do this?
[02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:37.530]  This is a goddamn war!
[02:25:38.049 --> 02:25:39.690]  This ain't a fucking game!
[02:25:39.909 --> 02:25:41.209]  This is for real, people!
[02:25:41.809 --> 02:25:43.149]  World War III already started!
[02:25:44.170 --> 02:25:45.250]  You want to die?
[02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:48.290]  You want to eat bugs?
[02:25:48.909 --> 02:25:52.270]  You want to be shot up full of HIV nanotech?
[02:25:52.690 --> 02:25:54.129]  Because that's what's going down.
[02:26:10.729 --> 02:26:11.889]  It's going down.
[02:26:12.969 --> 02:26:13.969]  It's going down.
[02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:16.040]  It's going down!
[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:17.979]  It's going down!
[02:26:29.979 --> 02:26:31.500]  We need a sense of urgency.
[02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:41.950]  I had one of the founders of the original Black Panther Party on a few weeks ago, and what did he say over and over again?
[02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:44.809]  He said, we need urgency.
[02:26:44.969 --> 02:26:45.690]  We need urgency.
[02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:47.729]  They're going to launch the race attacks.
[02:26:47.889 --> 02:26:48.809]  They're going to launch the war.
[02:26:49.010 --> 02:26:50.309]  They're going to launch the new virus.
[02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.690]  That's right.
[02:27:04.639 --> 02:27:05.159]  He knows.
[02:27:05.479 --> 02:27:06.280]  I'm so angry.
[02:27:06.399 --> 02:27:07.360]  I've known that guy 20-something years.
[02:27:07.459 --> 02:27:07.940]  What's his name?
[02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:11.860]  Larry Pinckney.
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:12.920]  God, I'm so angry.
[02:27:12.979 --> 02:27:14.399]  I can't even remember my mother's name right now.
[02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:17.600]  He gets it.
[02:27:18.559 --> 02:27:20.299]  Why aren't there more people like him?
[02:27:22.739 --> 02:27:25.520]  Oh, you're not going to see the news pointing the camera at Larry Pinckney, though.
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:29.079]  Because he's a real American.
[02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:32.149]  When I look at him, I don't think that's a black man.
[02:27:32.229 --> 02:27:32.809]  I think that's a man.
[02:27:32.909 --> 02:27:33.469]  That's an American.
[02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:34.530]  That's my friend, my brother.
[02:27:34.709 --> 02:27:36.770]  That's somebody that's smart and not stupid.
[02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:39.069]  That's somebody that doesn't want to be a slave.
[02:27:43.129 --> 02:27:50.930]  So we need to take the spirit of Larry Pinckney and shoot it in people's veins, not a bunch of deadly poison like they do, to weaken us, to control us.
[02:27:52.270 --> 02:27:53.909]  All right, I got a bunch of other news to hit.
[02:27:54.629 --> 02:27:58.610]  Go ahead and play the Soros mouthpieces, Black Lives Matter.
[02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:59.110]  Here it is.
[02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:02.559]  It's like everybody else has vigilantes.
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:06.399]  We need some black vigilantes.
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:07.120]  That's right.
[02:28:07.879 --> 02:28:14.340]  People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud?
[02:28:15.819 --> 02:28:20.420]  How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us?
[02:28:21.139 --> 02:28:22.020]  I'm tired.
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:27.479]  I know you're looking for us to be like, oh, go and march, go and march.
[02:28:27.639 --> 02:28:27.799]  No.
[02:28:28.639 --> 02:28:38.209]  This weekend, I want you to hold a community event Everywhere from the Bronx to Houston to Seattle to Florida.
[02:28:38.649 --> 02:28:44.350]  Black people, whole community events and talk about what you need.
[02:28:44.629 --> 02:28:46.870]  The founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York.
[02:28:47.899 --> 02:28:55.819]  I stand here heartbroken because I have to hug a father who knows that the murderer of his son will most likely go free.
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:07.120]  Who has to look in the face of a jury that no matter the facts, no matter the expert witnesses, no matter the people yelling on that train that day to let Jordan go, you will kill him.
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:14.540]  They will not find a white man guilty of killing a black man in modern day America.
[02:29:14.899 --> 02:29:17.139]  This is no different than Jim Crow.
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:22.040]  This looks like a picture out of the picture book when you look at that anonymous jury.
[02:29:22.399 --> 02:29:26.319]  We have baby boomers who are there doing Jim Crow on this jury.
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:31.040]  We have young people who are looking at Daniel Penney as a hero.
[02:29:31.399 --> 02:29:34.959]  And what America is a hero, a killer.
[02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:37.319]  He didn't give a crap about Jordan.
[02:29:37.950 --> 02:29:41.069]  The medical examiner said Jordan turned purple.
[02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:45.229]  Yes, black people can turn purple when they're denied oxygen.
[02:29:45.709 --> 02:29:49.149]  Every lab report showed he died of asphyxiation.
[02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:54.530]  And that doesn't matter because they want to spare a white man the penalty of his crimes.
[02:29:54.829 --> 02:29:59.129]  America has not changed and I hate to say it, it may never change.
[02:29:59.370 --> 02:30:01.950]  And people who keep asking, are we gonna riot?
[02:30:02.069 --> 02:30:02.850]  Are we gonna protest?
[02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:04.290]  Is that what's needed?
[02:30:04.989 --> 02:30:06.350]  Do glass have to break?
[02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:10.209]  Do cars have to burn for a black man to get justice in America?
[02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:12.250]  We can't show up with peace.
[02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:13.909]  We can't show up with facts.
[02:30:14.209 --> 02:30:17.110]  We can't show up with evidence and witness after witness.
[02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:21.649]  You give us nothing and then you ask us to love this country.
[02:30:22.069 --> 02:30:25.809]  America hates black people and we see it from that jury pool.
[02:30:29.139 --> 02:30:32.520]  A black man was lynched and his name was Jordan Neely.
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:33.959]  What's his name?
[02:30:34.059 --> 02:30:35.079]  Jordan Neely!
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.100]  Say his name!
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.299]  Jordan Neely!
[02:30:37.459 --> 02:30:38.319]  What's his name?
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:39.559]  Jordan Neely!
[02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:43.559]  Jordan Neely!
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:46.239]  That's enough.
[02:30:47.229 --> 02:30:57.170]  The point is, you hear the news pointing cameras, you see the news pointing cameras at black people protesting that over half the black people never get out of their mother's wombs?
[02:30:57.250 --> 02:30:58.469]  No, they're not pissed about that.
[02:30:58.569 --> 02:30:59.909]  Because she's reading a script.
[02:31:00.729 --> 02:31:02.430]  Of course, everything she said was bull.
[02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:04.010]  The guy was big.
[02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:04.569]  He was mean.
[02:31:04.649 --> 02:31:05.170]  He was crazy.
[02:31:05.170 --> 02:31:06.729]  He'd been arrested hundreds of times.
[02:31:08.569 --> 02:31:10.569]  And he's struggling and he's fighting.
[02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:14.329]  And the black people tried to restrain him.
[02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:18.229]  And they said, no, that guy helped us.
[02:31:18.489 --> 02:31:20.069]  You think that guy wanted that trouble?
[02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:23.569]  You know, what about Kyle Rittenhouse?
[02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:29.850]  You know, he shot and killed two white people and wounded another that were chasing him and said they're going to kill him and pulling guns on him.
[02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:33.489]  That was a white guy killed white people.
[02:31:34.290 --> 02:31:42.229]  And the left wanted him to go to prison because they don't want you to be able to defend yourself against a black person, a white person, or anybody else.
[02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.950]  They're the elite.
[02:31:44.090 --> 02:31:45.049]  They got the bodyguards.
[02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:46.530]  They're the ones that defund the police.
[02:31:47.409 --> 02:31:52.549]  They're the ones that want you to live in one of these big cities and not have a gun to protect yourself so the criminals can run wild.
[02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:53.690]  And we all know that.
[02:31:55.870 --> 02:31:57.270]  You know how rare it is?
[02:31:57.370 --> 02:31:59.989]  Look at the crime statistics of white men killing black men.
[02:32:01.430 --> 02:32:03.129]  It's one of the rarest things out there.
[02:32:05.479 --> 02:32:15.620]  In every case of a white cop killing a black person, the media and the system and the Soros-funded groups run around and look at it, and they try to misrepresent it.
[02:32:15.739 --> 02:32:19.239]  Remember that case in Virginia of the black lady?
[02:32:19.940 --> 02:32:22.379]  The neighbor, she's been going crazy for days in there.
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.159]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:32:23.219 --> 02:32:23.940]  She's screaming, yelling.
[02:32:24.239 --> 02:32:29.579]  They call the police, an Asian cop, like 27 years on the force.
[02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:31.600]  Perfect record.
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:37.659]  Goes to the door, knocks on it, and she opens it and starts trying to stab him with a butcher knife.
[02:32:38.139 --> 02:32:42.100]  And he runs from her and says, please, no, I don't want to shoot you.
[02:32:42.399 --> 02:32:45.639]  And then she stabs him in the face and the chest, and he shoots her.
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:49.620]  And then the police didn't release the video for a month.
[02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:52.700]  And Black Lives Matter, it turns out, knew the case.
[02:32:52.899 --> 02:32:58.659]  And they'd actually, because they had the lawyers involved, they'd seen it and said a white cop killed a black woman.
[02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.260]  They deliberately lied.
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:06.100]  Imagine if it had been a white cop or a black anybody.
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:18.440]  You go, you get called to a door, the door opens, and a 6'5 black woman charges you with a butcher knife, stabbing you in the face.
[02:33:18.879 --> 02:33:20.540]  What the hell are you going to do?
[02:33:21.319 --> 02:33:25.700]  You think that Asian cop went to work that day and said, I want to shoot a black woman?
[02:33:26.139 --> 02:33:29.200]  I want a black woman to stab me in the face with a butcher knife?
[02:33:29.379 --> 02:33:30.620]  Guys, pull that video up.
[02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.930]  Hell no.
[02:33:33.989 --> 02:33:38.530]  But they tried to use it to get riots going.
[02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:43.850]  And they're going to get their riots going when they blow up a black church or something.
[02:33:46.649 --> 02:33:47.770]  Because none of it makes sense.
[02:33:47.930 --> 02:33:49.129]  Trump's going to come kill the black people?
[02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:49.989]  We eat armed reprisons?
[02:33:50.430 --> 02:33:50.750]  Carville?
[02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:52.270]  They've all been saying, what?
[02:33:53.170 --> 02:33:54.569]  Trump's going to kill black people, what?
[02:33:55.569 --> 02:33:58.950]  That's like saying a unicorn's going to show up in my backyard this evening.
[02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:01.110]  It's just like, what?
[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:03.489]  Well, you know what they're going to do.
[02:34:03.549 --> 02:34:04.770]  That's not hard to figure out.
[02:34:13.930 --> 02:34:16.969]  It's going to happen, and everybody's going to ask how I know.
[02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:18.969]  How do I know?
[02:34:22.549 --> 02:34:28.309]  How do I know when big-ass thunderstorms and see lightning and I can see rain from a mile away and tell my wife, hey, it's about to rain?
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:32.239]  You can see the storm with your own eyeballs.
[02:34:32.399 --> 02:34:33.319]  You can smell the rain.
[02:34:35.579 --> 02:34:36.079]  Yeah.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:42.000]  Alright, let's play a clip here.
[02:34:42.079 --> 02:35:00.000]  This is AOC reading her script trying to say that Daniel Penny needs to be locked up because there's all these dangerous white veterans out there that just want to get thrown in prison.
[02:35:01.459 --> 02:35:03.100]  You know, you wonder why crime's gotten so bad.
[02:35:03.239 --> 02:35:04.940]  Cops slow roll all the black areas.
[02:35:05.399 --> 02:35:08.180]  The black people that are smart, and that's most of them, complain.
[02:35:08.319 --> 02:35:09.239]  They say, yeah, crime's way worse.
[02:35:09.959 --> 02:35:11.120]  Cops show up an hour later now.
[02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:12.319]  Cops won't come to the door.
[02:35:12.479 --> 02:35:14.020]  Well, why do you think they don't?
[02:35:14.079 --> 02:35:16.280]  If they make a mistake, they're going to prison for the rest of their lives.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:23.200]  What type of crap job would you take like that that's so dangerous and you don't get any backing in any way?
[02:35:24.579 --> 02:35:26.700]  And everything you do is misrepresented.
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.299]  And you look at the quality of the police, I'll tell you, it's bad.
[02:35:32.399 --> 02:35:40.680]  I mean, cops used to, whether they were black, Hispanic, white, were smart and badasses, and that was the, you know, tough guy thing to do, and that was what the warriors went and did.
[02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:44.280]  Now you look at a lot of the police, and it's like, what the hell?
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:45.760]  What is this?
[02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:51.299]  And you don't have protection for them now, either, do you?
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:53.079]  And now the Democrats want your guns.
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:57.579]  So you can live like they do in other countries, with just crime off the charts.
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:12.760]  Here's AOC. I just feel like that tells us everything.
[02:36:13.079 --> 02:36:27.040]  If we do not want violence on our subways, and the point of our justice system is a level of accountability to prevent a person who does not have remorse about taking another person's life.
[02:36:27.299 --> 02:36:54.469]  I mean, even people We need to take that video,
[02:36:54.469 --> 02:37:08.559]  it's very short, and then put clips of Daniel Penny saying he's sorry that the man he killed died and that he wished it wouldn't have happened and it was an accident and that it's been the worst thing in his life.
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:11.020]  But sure, he doesn't have any remorse.
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:12.459]  Why?
[02:37:13.639 --> 02:37:15.379]  She said he committed manslaughter.
[02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:16.739]  He was found not guilty.
[02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:19.840]  You're a liar!
[02:37:21.639 --> 02:37:24.040]  But her idiot constituents hear that.
[02:37:25.319 --> 02:37:30.340]  Her moron constituents see that and they go, yeah, he's not even sorry for it.
[02:37:31.299 --> 02:37:34.000]  She's given scripts and she reads them.
[02:37:35.139 --> 02:37:37.360]  Put Soros' head on her.
[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:40.180]  Incredible.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:42.520]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with the Blue Beam news.
[02:37:42.659 --> 02:37:43.079]  It's big.
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:44.860]  And more.
[02:37:45.079 --> 02:37:50.620]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, I've got some very good news for folks.
[02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:57.370]  One of our best-selling products through our great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:57.909]  And it funds the info war at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:40:58.149 --> 02:41:04.930]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:41:05.209 --> 02:41:06.750]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:08.170]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.590]  Thank you, sir.
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:12.760]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:41:12.899 --> 02:41:19.319]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:41:19.459 --> 02:41:23.319]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[02:41:23.719 --> 02:41:26.260]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[02:41:26.459 --> 02:41:28.079]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:29.979]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[02:41:30.059 --> 02:41:31.139]  And we're finally winning.
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:42.659]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you, To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:41:42.819 --> 02:41:52.840]  He was giving everything to InfoWars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:54.340]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:41:54.500 --> 02:42:00.620]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[02:42:01.509 --> 02:42:08.350]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:42:08.829 --> 02:42:10.069]  The supplements are there.
[02:42:10.229 --> 02:42:10.850]  They're great.
[02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:12.190]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:42:12.229 --> 02:42:13.149]  He's put everything into it.
[02:42:13.149 --> 02:42:13.569]  He has.
[02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:14.209]  They're incredible.
[02:42:14.489 --> 02:42:24.170]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:42:24.209 --> 02:42:25.489]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:42:26.319 --> 02:42:49.680]  We're good to go.
[02:42:49.729 --> 02:42:56.329]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:58.590]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[02:42:58.790 --> 02:43:01.290]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:43:01.850 --> 02:43:05.809]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[02:43:06.129 --> 02:43:07.450]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:08.229]  He's a fighter.
[02:43:08.350 --> 02:43:09.190]  Hell, he's my dad.
[02:43:09.350 --> 02:43:10.309]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:43:10.530 --> 02:43:11.950]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:20.129]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:43:20.329 --> 02:43:22.989]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:24.069]  It's about my parents.
[02:43:24.690 --> 02:43:30.149]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted me.
[02:43:30.629 --> 02:43:33.670]  So, please, support the info war today.
[02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:35.770]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:38.770]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[02:43:39.049 --> 02:43:43.510]  And if 5% of the millions watching will go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:49.129]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:52.770]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[02:43:53.309 --> 02:43:56.450]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[02:43:56.549 --> 02:43:58.049]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[02:43:58.190 --> 02:44:00.370]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do, and I'm going to do it.
[02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:06.690]  I've been talking some about all of these insane UFO sightings.
[02:44:07.909 --> 02:44:09.690]  And I know exactly what's going on.
[02:44:10.829 --> 02:44:13.010]  And I've had some coverage of it, but not enough.
[02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:21.729]  Because on a scale of 1 to 10, the amount of this activity is 50. I mean, compared to what there was in the past.
[02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:24.590]  And I know exactly why the globalists are doing it.
[02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:28.809]  And I need to go through every facet of it.
[02:44:31.559 --> 02:44:33.280]  That would probably take 20 minutes.
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:35.860]  And I've got a lot more to cover here.
[02:44:35.959 --> 02:44:58.120]  And Harrison Smith and Chase guys are going to be coming in with a lot of breaking news and hard-hitting clubs in the rest of the hour because I have to go watch and listen to the second day of the judge order of investigation into the fraudulent sale of Infowars to Michael Bloomberg's group.
[02:44:58.239 --> 02:44:59.680]  That's Bloomberg running it all.
[02:45:03.299 --> 02:45:04.500]  And I love the crew.
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.420]  I love these studios.
[02:45:05.979 --> 02:45:14.079]  We'll still have the crew operating regardless under the Alex Jones Network, but they unveiled yesterday their nasty plan, which I already knew.
[02:45:14.979 --> 02:45:17.920]  And the lawyers are like, I've talked to first-minute lawyers, they can't do that.
[02:45:17.979 --> 02:45:18.940]  The law says they can't.
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:20.260]  They don't care.
[02:45:20.639 --> 02:45:21.700]  I'm the test case.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:30.459]  So it's going to be rough any way we slice it, but that's what I'd expect because they're always coming after me.
[02:45:33.210 --> 02:45:35.389]  So, they don't want this show getting out.
[02:45:35.930 --> 02:45:37.110]  You know what to do.
[02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:42.930]  Take the articles, take the videos, take the reports, get them out.
[02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:45.889]  But here's the bottom line on the UAVs.
[02:45:48.270 --> 02:45:49.209]  Anything's unidentified.
[02:45:49.530 --> 02:45:59.170]  If you look up at a plane 35,000 feet in the air with your naked eye, you can see it's a big passenger plane, but you can't tell if it's an Airbus or a 777. It's unidentified.
[02:46:01.159 --> 02:46:03.479]  Technically, that just means you can't tell the make and model.
[02:46:05.399 --> 02:46:05.840]  Okay?
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:12.440]  So people equate UFO with aliens.
[02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:15.879]  So the media plays this game and goes, what's that?
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:16.540]  We don't know.
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:17.959]  There's all these planes over us.
[02:46:18.399 --> 02:46:19.840]  The Pentagon doesn't know.
[02:46:19.979 --> 02:46:20.540]  No one knows.
[02:46:20.719 --> 02:46:21.979]  Pure crap.
[02:46:24.059 --> 02:46:30.920]  Again, in China, they show thousands of drones working together to create these illusions of monsters or dragons or whales in the air.
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:38.340]  Well, that's going on over here, but our loving government isn't showing it or admitting it.
[02:46:38.979 --> 02:46:40.700]  But you can see it's groups of drones.
[02:46:40.799 --> 02:46:43.100]  Look at that giant flying saucer, and it's a bunch of drones.
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:44.100]  You can see them moving around.
[02:46:47.319 --> 02:46:51.659]  If the Chinese wanted to show big flying saucers over their cities, they could do that with these things.
[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:57.100]  So, the question is, why is the government jacking with people?
[02:46:59.159 --> 02:47:01.040]  Why is the government messing with people?
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:07.639]  Well, it lets the Russians know they got a bunch of secret technology, but that's only a side point.
[02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:20.430]  They're doing it And acting like it's aliens, as a psyop, and are strongly considering having them start new violent things.
[02:47:20.590 --> 02:47:42.030]  Shoot down airplanes, attack people, to get us off of worried about Fauci and the poison shots in the New World Order and Bill Gates, and to get us focused in to this crap.
[02:47:42.149 --> 02:47:43.069]  Yeah, this is China.
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:49.100]  That's what they can do with holograms, a bunch of lasers, and drones.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.879]  There's stuff even crazier than this.
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:48:07.020]  And then you look at the stuff over New Jersey, New York, San Antonio, and you can see, like, you know, it's 15 drones, and they're out, and they come in together and make a square, and it looks like a space, and it's an alien!
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:09.399]  You can see the damn drones right there!
[02:48:11.299 --> 02:48:13.340]  So, they're just jacking with people, as usual.
[02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:24.450]  You know, they got Soros is funding black people to run around so they can kill everybody, and they got fake aliens, and they got World War III going, and they got new viruses, and just, that's all they're doing, messing with everybody.
[02:48:24.729 --> 02:48:27.329]  So we don't get together and remove these criminals.
[02:48:27.930 --> 02:48:29.250]  We'll be right back with huge news.
[02:48:29.370 --> 02:48:29.829]  Stay with us.
[02:48:30.969 --> 02:48:32.850]  Go to hell, New World Order.
[02:48:42.549 --> 02:48:43.129]  We kept you.
[02:48:43.389 --> 02:48:44.809]  We are running some old friends.
[02:48:45.049 --> 02:48:45.530]  Is she alright?
[02:48:45.809 --> 02:48:47.209]  Seems okay if we can get to it.
[02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:56.149]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.
[02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:11.350]  Harrison, visit infowars.com forward slash show now.
[02:49:19.430 --> 02:49:26.190]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:30.010]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show today.
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:46.579]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:46.739 --> 02:49:48.020]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:48.219 --> 02:49:51.120]  I'm Harrison Smith with Chase Geyser in studio.
[02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:52.559]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:49:52.659 --> 02:49:54.639]  We have a lot to cover today.
[02:49:54.879 --> 02:50:30.049]  I, of course, host the American Journal in the morning, and I spent practically the whole show talking about Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of the UHC, UnitedHealthcare Insurance Division CEO. We're good to go.
[02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:33.780]  Yeah, so investigative journalism isn't really my bag.
[02:50:33.959 --> 02:50:41.440]  I'm more of an analysis guy, but every once in a while something happens and I become so intrigued that I become enthralled with it for hours.
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:47.780]  And that's what's happened today to me with this Luigi Mangione story.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:57.120]  So the first thing I looked at when I got into the office this morning was I remember that this video was circulating yesterday of a man named Brian Thompson.
[02:50:57.930 --> 02:51:06.190]  Saying that he owned Nancy Pelosi and everyone was saying that it was the Brian Thompson associated with the CEO that was killed.
[02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:09.329]  Yeah, this company, but it was actually different, Brian Thompson.
[02:51:09.569 --> 02:51:09.670]  Right.
[02:51:09.850 --> 02:51:11.350]  So the video that was going around wasn't really him.
[02:51:11.690 --> 02:51:23.409]  But in doing the research, assuming that the video was him before I realized that it wasn't, I just wanted to look up whether or not the Pelosi family had any connection with With the Mangione family.
[02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:37.690]  And I found this article from the Washington Post back in 1989. And there was some scandal with Nicholas Mangione, who is Luigi Mangione's grandfather, over a racial slur that was used in one of the companies.
[02:51:37.690 --> 02:51:39.930]  And it was a nephew that worked for him, I believe, or a relative.
[02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:53.020]  And We see here that Thomas J. D'Alessandro III, which is Nancy Pelosi's oldest brother, came out in this article in defense of Mangione saying he's a family man, things of that nature.
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:59.340]  And so we know that the Pelosi family knew the Mangione family going back decades.
[02:51:59.889 --> 02:52:07.670]  So, A, it's bizarre that Nancy Pelosi is basically directly connected to Luigi Mangione, at least through his grandfather.
[02:52:08.409 --> 02:52:11.530]  Both their families were prominent families in the region.
[02:52:12.350 --> 02:52:17.780]  But the other aspect that's bizarre about it is all of these scandals that surround The insider trading.
[02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:20.020]  Now, we know that Nancy Pelosi is famous for insider trading.
[02:52:20.139 --> 02:52:25.579]  We know that there's the Pelosi stock tracker, which is very successful for people who follow it.
[02:52:25.659 --> 02:52:31.920]  We know that Unusual Whales has done amazing coverage with their tools, tracking these deep state purchases and this insider trading.
[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:46.219]  And so we have this situation where the CEO of this company Was supposed to testify to the Department of Justice regarding some insider trading issues.
[02:52:46.459 --> 02:52:50.020]  Now, it wasn't specifically pertaining to Nancy Pelosi or Paul Pelosi.
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:53.440]  It was pertaining to another case from years ago.
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:53:04.879]  That being said, on February of this year, there was a major cyber attack of UnitedHealthcare.
[02:53:05.579 --> 02:53:08.299]  By this hacker group that's sort of infamous.
[02:53:09.159 --> 02:53:24.100]  And the same day that this attack took place, and in about a couple of weeks prior, within a couple of weeks prior, Paul Pelosi had been buying shares like crazy of this company called Palo Alto Networks, which is a cybersecurity company.
[02:53:24.459 --> 02:53:31.639]  And that company just so happened to get the contract from UnitedHealthcare to respond to the cyber attack that took place.
[02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:41.100]  So the Pelosi's in the weeks leading up to the cyber attack were investing in this company that just so happened to be the company that was picked by UnitedHealthcare.
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:54:01.239]  So the stock value skyrocketed, estimates of 55% at least gains this year for Paul Pelosi's investments, all coupled with the fact that the Pelosi's know the Mangione's, all coupled with the fact that there was an insider trading investigation going on with this CEO. I was thinking,
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:02.379]  man, this sounds like a hit.
[02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:03.329]  Right?
[02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:05.950]  And obviously this is just circumstantial evidence.
[02:54:06.309 --> 02:54:07.870]  There's no way I can prove any of this.
[02:54:07.989 --> 02:54:10.389]  I'm just speculating and looking at these details here.
[02:54:10.450 --> 02:54:15.709]  But then I started looking more into this Luigi Mangione as an individual.
[02:54:15.709 --> 02:54:20.549]  And now the official narrative coming out about him is that he was a very bright young man.
[02:54:21.229 --> 02:54:24.790]  He graduated as valedictorian from a very prestigious high school.
[02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:34.370]  Then he studied engineering, I believe, for his bachelor's degree at Stanford and got a master's degree in engineering with an emphasis on information technology, I believe, in computer science.
[02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:40.989]  So this is somebody who's kind of Ted Kaczynski-esque in terms of very bright, all of a sudden kind of going off the rocker.
[02:54:41.149 --> 02:54:42.129]  Why is this going on?
[02:54:42.329 --> 02:54:46.809]  And the reports in the mainstream narrative are that he'd had a back injury.
[02:54:48.319 --> 02:54:53.440]  We're good to go.
[02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:17.930]  Luigi Mangione was bitter about the chronic pain that he was experiencing and blaming a failed healthcare system for it.
[02:55:17.989 --> 02:55:19.270]  That's what they're kind of trying to push.
[02:55:19.350 --> 02:55:20.049]  And maybe that's true.
[02:55:20.129 --> 02:55:20.590]  I don't know.
[02:55:21.069 --> 02:55:24.870]  But what's very interesting is, obviously, I work at InfoWars.
[02:55:25.149 --> 02:55:31.989]  And whenever you look at somebody like a Mangione or a Crooks or Kaczynski or others, you think MKUltra, right?
[02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:33.709]  Especially if they went to an Ivy League school.
[02:55:33.850 --> 02:55:39.170]  I mean, we know that the MKUltra program was prevalent in Stanford and Harvard and other major schools.
[02:55:39.989 --> 02:55:49.729]  And so I'm looking this guy up, and there is just circumstantial evidence after circumstantial evidence that something MKUltra was kind of going on.
[02:55:49.809 --> 02:55:53.889]  And I don't know if it was intentional in the way that MKUltra was intentional, but just look at these details here.
[02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:59.469]  So we've got his profile picture, his profile on X, and he's got a mushroom featured at the top.
[02:56:00.319 --> 02:56:00.500]  Right?
[02:56:00.579 --> 02:56:00.940]  No big deal.
[02:56:01.059 --> 02:56:01.879]  A lot of people like mushrooms.
[02:56:02.479 --> 02:56:04.219]  And then I'm looking at his posts.
[02:56:04.579 --> 02:56:09.520]  He posted a podcast with Andrew Huberman, who I really do admire.
[02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:11.239]  I'm not trying to rope Andrew Huberman in this.
[02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:15.840]  But if you go to an hour and 18 minutes into the podcast that was posted, it's about psilocybin research.
[02:56:16.709 --> 02:56:19.889]  And then, I got the screenshot right here, actually, where I searched the transcript.
[02:56:20.010 --> 02:56:20.989]  An hour, 1850 seconds.
[02:56:21.549 --> 02:56:26.750]  Then you've got this post right here, where he says, placebo-controlled trials of psychedelics be like.
[02:56:27.209 --> 02:56:30.909]  And so he's talking about psychedelic studies, and he's posting...
[02:56:30.909 --> 02:56:31.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:56:31.729 --> 02:56:31.950]  Go ahead.
[02:56:31.989 --> 02:56:33.069]  It's on document cam.
[02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:40.250]  So this is a post, or it's a retweet from Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of the CEO joke, a New Yorker cartoon.
[02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:43.690]  Yeah.
[02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:18.030]  And he's following Matthew W. Johnson, psychedelic scientist at Shepard Pratt, conducted seminal psychedelic research for 20 years.
[02:57:18.350 --> 02:57:20.110]  All these psychedelic pages, right?
[02:57:20.909 --> 02:57:26.610]  And like I mentioned, Andrew Huberman as well, who's the professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford Medicine.
[02:57:26.930 --> 02:57:30.149]  So I'm looking at something like, all right, he's obviously very interested in psychedelics and mushrooms.
[02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:35.149]  So I'm like, I wonder what psychedelic research is going on at Stanford, his alma mater, right?
[02:57:35.549 --> 02:57:46.180]  And it turns out that There is a study that's been going on since at least 2020 called psilocybin therapy for chronic lower back pain.
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:54.280]  So he's got chronic lower back pain and they're doing these psilocybin studies and there's the psilocybin therapy for chronic back pain.
[02:57:54.379 --> 02:57:55.719]  Here's the description of the study here.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.760]  And so again, this is circumstantial.
[02:57:58.079 --> 02:57:59.620]  All circumstantial, all speculative.
[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:10.290]  At Stanford, which he's associated with, there is a study going on studying magic mushroom, psycho, however you say it, On back pain, lower back pain.
[02:58:10.489 --> 02:58:10.590]  Right.
[02:58:10.690 --> 02:58:14.110]  This just checks all the boxes when you're talking about Luigi Mangione.
[02:58:14.290 --> 02:58:22.370]  And he has, and just to point out, there's this Pokemon, some sort of mushroom Pokemon, as one of the three images he chose as a header.
[02:58:22.569 --> 02:58:34.569]  It's the mushroom Pokemon, a lower back pain, or an x-ray of some sort of post-surgery lower back, nails in his back, and then him, of course, on a mountaintop.
[02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.809]  But...
[02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:35.420]  Right.
[02:58:35.559 --> 02:58:41.100]  But that mushroom Pokemon, again, is another just strange thing to have.
[02:58:41.319 --> 02:58:51.479]  Not to mention a significant portion of the people he follows are psilocybin experts and engaged in psilocybin studies, whether they're at Johns Hopkins or Stanford or UC Berkeley or other institutions.
[02:58:51.680 --> 02:58:55.000]  But I looked up, and according to ChatGPT...
[02:58:55.819 --> 02:59:00.799]  The professors behind these studies that are going on in lower back pain using psilocybin.
[02:59:00.899 --> 02:59:12.079]  And I looked up Dr. Joshua D. Woolley, MD, PhD, is an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, which is conducting this study.
[02:59:12.629 --> 02:59:14.329]  In conjunction with Stanford.
[02:59:14.829 --> 02:59:18.209]  And he's been doing psychedelic research for quite some time.
[02:59:18.350 --> 02:59:28.709]  In 2015, Dr. Joshua Woolley was awarded a $1.3 million grant from the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, a branch of the Department of Defense.
[02:59:28.889 --> 02:59:36.629]  The study titled, The Psychobiological Assessment and Enhancement of Team Cohesion and Psychobiological Resilience Using a Virtual Team Cohesion Test.
[02:59:36.770 --> 02:59:41.649]  So this guy that's running these studies is directly funded by the Department of Defense.
[02:59:41.829 --> 02:59:42.190]  Hmm.
[02:59:53.659 --> 02:59:59.159]  I'm thinking that this guy was a bad side effect to some of these studies.
[02:59:59.299 --> 03:00:01.739]  I think he spun out MKUltra style.
[03:00:02.629 --> 03:00:07.010]  And you know, a lot of what we've heard about him so far does correspond with a lot of that.
[03:00:07.010 --> 03:00:08.809]  And what we know about MKUltra corresponds to that.
[03:00:08.889 --> 03:00:15.430]  I mean, MKUltra was instrumental in the proliferation of acid and the whole psychedelic movement.
[03:00:15.430 --> 03:00:18.290]  I mean, it was very deeply tied into that.
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:28.219]  So it's not out of the question that they would be continuing to test the effects of that type of intake.
[03:00:28.479 --> 03:00:28.879]  Right.
[03:00:29.079 --> 03:00:34.840]  And I'm not saying that they intentionally brainwashed them to commit this act, like I would probably say for Ted Kaczynski or others.
[03:00:35.850 --> 03:00:36.809]  MKUltra affects that.
[03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:46.329]  And of course, in case people don't know, Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, confirmed he absolutely was in an MKUltra program in Harvard when he went there when he was 16. It's not even disputed.
[03:00:46.409 --> 03:00:48.870]  Even the mainstreamers say yes, that absolutely happened.
[03:00:49.010 --> 03:01:01.049]  And so I'm thinking, and I'm pro psilocybin, I'm pro the ketamine therapy and all these alternative approaches to addiction and depression and PTSD. But when you're talking about psilocybin, it's kind of like a gun.
[03:01:01.409 --> 03:01:10.469]  It's something that's It's necessary and can be helpful and useful, but it's also very dangerous, especially if you give it to the wrong person.
[03:01:10.610 --> 03:01:19.850]  If you have somebody, for example, who has a predisposition to schizophrenia and you give them hallucinogens, it's way more likely that you're going to set off some sort of a psychological event that way.
[03:01:19.909 --> 03:01:29.809]  And so I'm just thinking that there's no way I can know for sure, but I bet he was in this study, and I bet you that he spun out as a result of it.
[03:01:30.609 --> 03:01:35.469]  There's certainly a lot there, and it corresponds with what we know about the timeline of his recent life.
[03:01:35.829 --> 03:01:42.190]  There was an article I was just reading saying that he was actually declared missing and reported missing by his mother a few weeks ago.
[03:01:42.329 --> 03:01:44.170]  And people said basically he seemed normal.
[03:01:44.370 --> 03:01:45.809]  He had this back accident.
[03:01:45.889 --> 03:01:48.370]  He sort of went off the rails a little bit there, but...
[03:01:49.450 --> 03:01:52.090]  After a little while, he basically completely disconnected.
[03:01:52.329 --> 03:01:56.290]  There are comments on his Twitter and Instagram, people going, hey man, where have you been?
[03:01:56.409 --> 03:01:57.489]  Everybody's looking for you.
[03:01:57.610 --> 03:01:58.370]  It's been months.
[03:01:58.549 --> 03:01:59.250]  Just hit me up.
[03:01:59.489 --> 03:02:00.430]  This sort of stuff.
[03:02:01.530 --> 03:02:04.770]  Apparently there's one comment from somebody saying, hey, you have obligations.
[03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:06.170]  You agreed to be in my wedding.
[03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:08.229]  If you're not going to be in it, I need to know.
[03:02:08.370 --> 03:02:13.489]  So obviously he had commitments down the line that he was flaking on and not responding to people.
[03:02:13.610 --> 03:02:21.639]  So he sort of Apparently went off the grid and was totally missing for a couple months before popping up in New York City shooting the CEO in the back.
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:24.920]  Yeah, and I've seen reports that he might have been in Japan for a little while.
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:31.940]  But basically he graduated and he got a job working for some company I believe called Trucar as a data analyst.
[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:33.819]  It's like a vehicle retailer.
[03:02:34.479 --> 03:02:37.120]  And fairly normal stuff until he injured himself.
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:40.520]  And the reports that I've seen are that his...
[03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:46.870]  Acquaintances say that after the surgery, I think specifically, is when he got really weird.
[03:02:47.149 --> 03:02:51.829]  And that would have kind of correlated with getting into some of these psychedelic studies.
[03:02:52.709 --> 03:02:54.389]  Yeah, it's all extremely interesting.
[03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:59.569]  And again, I spent most of the whole show this morning on this topic because...
[03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:11.319]  We're good to go.
[03:03:31.139 --> 03:03:38.559]  You know as well as anybody else, and the audience knows this better than anybody else, that there are certain people that we hate at this network.
[03:03:39.059 --> 03:03:42.739]  But we never advocate for violence or wish harm on them.
[03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:44.079]  We just want to defeat them politically.
[03:03:44.260 --> 03:03:47.040]  And it's not something that we say as a joke or as a wink or a dog whistle.
[03:03:47.239 --> 03:03:50.000]  We really do not want violence to come across the most.
[03:03:50.750 --> 03:03:52.149]  The most evil people in the world.
[03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:54.229]  We just want justice and victory over them, right?
[03:03:54.510 --> 03:03:55.049]  All right, so hold on.
[03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:55.790]  I was mistaken.
[03:03:55.889 --> 03:03:56.569]  Let me clarify.
[03:03:56.610 --> 03:03:58.190]  There's been a context note added.
[03:03:58.309 --> 03:04:00.770]  Thank you, X. Apparently, the image was edited.
[03:04:01.069 --> 03:04:03.870]  The actual Amazon listing states 100-plus bought in the past month.
[03:04:04.069 --> 03:04:05.930]  So apparently, that image was fake.
[03:04:05.950 --> 03:04:07.309]  But the sentiment is obviously real.
[03:04:07.389 --> 03:04:08.110]  You can go on Reddit.
[03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:11.750]  You can go on Blue Sky, whatever their alternative is.
[03:04:11.889 --> 03:04:13.309]  I mean, they are treating this guy like a hero.
[03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:22.629]  Yeah, so they're celebrating this guy.
[03:04:22.750 --> 03:04:28.750]  And of course, the irony is, as you point out there, Family Connections, Nancy Pelosi, Luigi Mangione comes from a much better off family.
[03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:35.069]  He's a part of the 1% of the 1%, where the guy he killed, his father, Brian Thompson's father, was a grain of...
[03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:48.889]  He's an elevator operator in Iowa, totally worked his way up through public school, just did the right thing, got a job at UHC, worked his way up the corporate ladder, and eventually became CEO. And of course, it's just the irony of all of these socialist scumbags.
[03:04:49.030 --> 03:04:49.930]  Eat the rich!
[03:04:50.030 --> 03:04:55.389]  And they're celebrating Luigi Mangione, who comes from this incredibly wealthy, one of the richest families in Maryland.
[03:04:55.389 --> 03:05:00.969]  His cousin or aunt or uncle or somebody is a congressman from there.
[03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:07.950]  So just the irony of the actual 1% You know, shooting this innocent dude.
[03:05:08.170 --> 03:05:11.829]  Even if Brian Thompson was a terrible person, you don't just kill somebody in the street.
[03:05:12.149 --> 03:05:14.709]  Right, because what's going to happen after this?
[03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:25.569]  CEOs right now, I guarantee you as we speak, they're putting in provisions to their contracts saying, now that this is so dangerous, now that people are getting killed in the street, I need a stipend for my security detail.
[03:05:26.969 --> 03:05:31.010]  I was making the argument on X, and some people agree with me, some people didn't.
[03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:41.010]  The idea that a millionaire, somebody who makes $10 million a year, a CEO of a company, is just walking down the street in New York City, this is part of our greatness.
[03:05:41.170 --> 03:05:42.549]  This is what makes America great.
[03:05:42.649 --> 03:05:48.950]  It's the ideal American vision, is having the rich and the poor basically indistinguishable from one another.
[03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:55.180]  We're good to go.
[03:06:08.059 --> 03:06:24.700]  That's all that this is encouraging, and it's just typical that you've got a bunch of socialist people online celebrating this guy when really what he did will only contribute to the greater separation between the ultra-rich and just everybody else, and everything just gets worse.
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:27.500]  I guess they just don't have any second-order thinking.
[03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:30.600]  They're just happy a rich white guy was shot.
[03:06:31.159 --> 03:06:33.059]  This is never retreat, never delete.
[03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:36.879]  I can't feel remorse for the CEO, none, yeah, his family, blah, blah.
[03:06:37.059 --> 03:06:39.040]  What about the families that have lost loved ones because of greed?
[03:06:39.219 --> 03:06:42.579]  Why do we save sympathy for those murdered by steel instead of paper?
[03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:44.040]  It's just so cringy.
[03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.680]  It's all just so cringy Reddit nihilist nonsense.
[03:06:47.319 --> 03:06:48.239]  No, and...
[03:06:49.489 --> 03:06:55.350]  It's almost like you've got the quote from Stalin of one death is a tragedy, 10,000 is a statistic.
[03:06:55.629 --> 03:07:06.670]  These people are so far gone that they cannot even empathize with just a random dude whose sons are now going to be celebrating Christmas without a parent in their life.
[03:07:06.770 --> 03:07:08.549]  It's just absolutely brutal what this guy did.
[03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:11.139]  Come on now.
[03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:12.159]  Come on now.
[03:07:12.260 --> 03:07:14.799]  No, but same thing I feel with Ted Kaczynski.
[03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:16.920]  Did he have some interesting ideas?
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:17.620]  Yeah, fine.
[03:07:17.719 --> 03:07:18.719]  He hated the steam engine.
[03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:19.639]  What a genius.
[03:07:19.879 --> 03:07:25.139]  But he also killed three random innocent people to get his stupid essay published.
[03:07:25.139 --> 03:07:33.520]  But the thing about Ted Kaczynski, and obviously what he did was evil, but he was right about identifying all the problems that he was frustrated with.
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:36.409]  I mean, his arguments for what was wrong were We're very good.
[03:07:36.530 --> 03:07:39.870]  It was the solution that he advocated that was screwed up.
[03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:43.770]  The problem is things are becoming too technological.
[03:07:43.989 --> 03:07:46.389]  My solution, I was going to blow an airline out of the sky.
[03:07:46.549 --> 03:07:46.909]  Exactly.
[03:07:47.129 --> 03:07:47.870]  It's ridiculous.
[03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:50.229]  I've read that book a couple of times.
[03:07:50.350 --> 03:07:51.090]  It's fairly sophisticated.
[03:07:51.229 --> 03:07:53.690]  The fact that he killed innocent people is tragic and obviously mentally ill.
[03:07:53.770 --> 03:07:56.329]  I think he's a victim of MKUltra to the utmost degree.
[03:07:56.969 --> 03:08:07.549]  But when I look through some of Luigi's arguments and some of the claims that are being made about his sentiments about healthcare and things of that nature, he's criticizing capitalism, but it's not really capitalism.
[03:08:07.870 --> 03:08:12.770]  So like with the Affordable Care Act, they put stipulations in the law.
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:20.739]  That make it so that health insurance companies can only legally make 10% more than whatever the cost of care is, right?
[03:08:20.879 --> 03:08:27.000]  So if you're a health insurance company and you're buying a pill for somebody for $100, you can only make $110 off of that, right?
[03:08:27.239 --> 03:08:30.700]  And so what happened then was it inverted the incentives.
[03:08:30.959 --> 03:08:39.200]  So now the health insurance companies want healthcare to be as expensive as possible because that's the only way they can actually build their revenue.
[03:08:39.559 --> 03:08:48.040]  So like a car insurance company, they want the mechanic to be as cheap as possible so when there's a claim, it's not a bunch out of pocket, but it's inverted because the law is unnatural, right?
[03:08:48.059 --> 03:08:48.500]  That's interesting.
[03:08:48.639 --> 03:08:55.680]  And so what he's frustrated with about healthcare, if it's true that he's frustrated with the healthcare system, it's not capitalism, it's fascism.
[03:08:55.780 --> 03:09:04.559]  It's the government getting involved and putting in regulations that are unnatural, they're not laissez-faire, they're not capitalistic, it's mixed economy at best, socialists at worst, communists at worst.
[03:09:04.940 --> 03:09:09.180]  And that's what frustrates me so much about the left is they criticize capitalism all day.
[03:09:09.450 --> 03:09:13.590]  But nothing that they point their finger at is actually an instance of capitalism.
[03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:19.870]  And I was even looking up all these complaints because people came out after this guy got killed saying, hey, I have UnitedHealthcare and they're terrible.
[03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.709]  Here's how they deny me.
[03:09:20.989 --> 03:09:25.030]  Every single one I saw, Medicare was the main problem.
[03:09:25.149 --> 03:09:26.829]  Everybody said, well, it's Medicare that's the issue.
[03:09:26.930 --> 03:09:28.209]  It's like, well, that's the government program.
[03:09:28.799 --> 03:09:34.379]  Even when you look at UnitedHealthcare itself, it seems like Medicare is really throwing a wrench in their works.
[03:09:34.459 --> 03:09:38.920]  And look, we complain all the time about big pharma and big medicine.
[03:09:38.979 --> 03:09:40.500]  But what do you think is going to happen?
[03:09:40.639 --> 03:09:42.700]  You kill the CEO. What, do they shut down?
[03:09:42.799 --> 03:09:43.920]  They go, okay, everybody go home.
[03:09:44.079 --> 03:09:44.899]  The company's over.
[03:09:45.139 --> 03:09:45.600]  It's fixed now.
[03:09:45.809 --> 03:09:47.950]  They put in somebody else who's honestly probably worse.
[03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:55.770]  If you look at who this Brian Thompson guy was, he's actually on record saying, insurance is messed up because we only treat people when they get sick.
[03:09:55.909 --> 03:09:59.610]  I want to start paying for doctors to keep their patients healthy, which is exactly what we say.
[03:09:59.610 --> 03:10:02.809]  It goes to the heart of what the issue is with medical care in this country.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this was MKUlter.
[03:10:06.040 --> 03:10:07.540]  In fact, we have a video.
[03:10:07.799 --> 03:10:11.959]  We won't be able to get to it here before the end of this segment, but we'll come in with it.
[03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:14.219]  Luigi Mangione has been transferred.
[03:10:14.360 --> 03:10:19.540]  I guess he's been officially charged, but as he was being transferred, he was yelling at the police.
[03:10:19.639 --> 03:10:20.239]  I guess we do have time.
[03:10:20.340 --> 03:10:21.299]  I guess we have a minute here.
[03:10:21.459 --> 03:10:30.860]  So let's go to clip number three in my list, guys, or the video that you're playing here with the audio to see what he's yelling as he's being transferred out of a van and into the courthouse.
[03:10:46.719 --> 03:10:53.000]  I think what he said there is this is an insult to Americans intelligence and their lived experiences.
[03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:54.700]  That language.
[03:10:54.979 --> 03:10:56.879]  I know, I know just the language he uses.
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:00.079]  I don't know.
[03:11:00.239 --> 03:11:01.500]  I don't know what to make of this guy.
[03:11:01.659 --> 03:11:05.420]  Everything about it sort of doesn't make a lot of sense.
[03:11:05.540 --> 03:11:09.879]  The dots are not connecting, and I guess we'll just have to wait and see what more information comes out.
[03:11:09.979 --> 03:11:13.299]  We'll be back on the other side of this short commercial break with more.
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:14.399]  We've got UFOs.
[03:11:14.459 --> 03:11:17.159]  We've got poison in the food and water.
[03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:22.579]  We've got Syria being taken over, and we have a story of ChatGPT attempting to break out.
[03:11:26.270 --> 03:11:32.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[03:11:32.370 --> 03:11:33.670]  He's only president-elect right now.
[03:11:33.829 --> 03:11:35.549]  We are exposing the globalists.
[03:11:35.690 --> 03:11:38.629]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:40.450]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[03:11:40.809 --> 03:11:42.829]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[03:11:43.209 --> 03:11:45.309]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:51.170]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at The Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[03:11:51.350 --> 03:11:56.629]  So when you go to our sponsor, TheAlexJonesStore.com, that's not owned by me.
[03:11:56.850 --> 03:12:05.329]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:12:05.329 --> 03:12:08.690]  They will not get The Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[03:12:09.149 --> 03:12:16.889]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[03:12:17.110 --> 03:12:20.329]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.

[03:12:22.010 --> 03:12:22.829]  Go check it out.
[03:12:23.129 --> 03:12:29.729]  That's their discounted up to 55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[03:12:29.950 --> 03:12:30.469]  Try it.
[03:12:30.510 --> 03:12:31.129]  You're going to love it.
[03:12:31.209 --> 03:12:31.649]  I'm on it.
[03:12:31.729 --> 03:12:32.510]  I've lost so much weight.
[03:12:32.770 --> 03:12:33.489]  It's insane.
[03:12:33.610 --> 03:12:34.610]  Get that and other supplements.
[03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:35.049]  And then...
[03:12:35.629 --> 03:12:39.290]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[03:12:39.489 --> 03:12:45.809]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[03:12:45.909 --> 03:12:46.770]  They have the best designs.
[03:12:47.129 --> 03:12:48.889]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[03:12:48.969 --> 03:12:51.370]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[03:12:51.709 --> 03:12:53.030]  These designs are incredible.
[03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:59.430]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[03:12:59.590 --> 03:13:00.170]  Here they are.
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:01.120]  Look at this one.
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:05.200]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:07.200]  We are all Alex Jones.
[03:13:07.379 --> 03:13:08.379]  You've got to get that.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:10.719]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[03:13:10.979 --> 03:13:11.639]  Oh my goodness.
[03:13:12.059 --> 03:13:15.260]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[03:13:15.799 --> 03:13:18.659]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:20.280]  Team Humanity.
[03:13:20.479 --> 03:13:21.959]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[03:13:22.079 --> 03:13:24.299]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[03:13:24.459 --> 03:13:26.239]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[03:13:26.670 --> 03:13:31.850]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[03:13:32.270 --> 03:13:33.209]  Darkest Hour.
[03:13:33.450 --> 03:13:34.670]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[03:13:34.930 --> 03:13:39.770]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:13:39.809 --> 03:13:41.930]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[03:13:42.500 --> 03:13:47.299]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:59.920]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[03:13:59.979 --> 03:14:03.719]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[03:14:04.319 --> 03:14:07.639]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:10.059]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[03:14:10.239 --> 03:14:11.479]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[03:14:11.579 --> 03:14:12.840]  We get part of it to operate.
[03:14:13.479 --> 03:14:16.020]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[03:14:16.159 --> 03:14:17.760]  And they spread the word, you meet like-minded people.
[03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:24.139]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[03:14:24.239 --> 03:14:27.420]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[03:14:27.799 --> 03:14:38.409]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[03:14:38.569 --> 03:14:41.010]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[03:14:41.149 --> 03:14:51.309]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[03:14:51.450 --> 03:14:53.290]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[03:14:53.489 --> 03:14:54.729]  You're going to want to order again.
[03:14:54.969 --> 03:14:57.129]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[03:14:57.579 --> 03:14:58.620]  I'm suing the deep state.
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:14:59.559]  We're going after them.
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:05.700]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[03:15:06.020 --> 03:15:07.159]  We're going to win this thing.
[03:15:07.260 --> 03:15:10.920]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:20.520]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[03:15:21.860 --> 03:15:24.479]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:27.950]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:28.149 --> 03:15:33.709]  Yes, we are here in the InfoWars headquarters coming to you live on this Tuesday afternoon, December 10th.
[03:15:33.809 --> 03:15:36.329]  I'm Harrison Smith sitting in studio with Chase Geyser.
[03:15:37.100 --> 03:15:48.639]  We're good to go.
[03:15:59.340 --> 03:16:16.280]  We're good to go.
[03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:26.270]  We hope you support us.
[03:16:26.350 --> 03:16:27.569]  And if you don't, you won't.
[03:16:27.629 --> 03:16:28.569]  And it's as simple as that.
[03:16:28.709 --> 03:16:31.770]  So I hope you do support us by going to the alexjonesstore.com.
[03:16:31.870 --> 03:16:34.450]  That will help us to get wherever we're going.
[03:16:34.729 --> 03:16:36.850]  And the crew was preempting me.
[03:16:36.989 --> 03:16:38.290]  Dr. Jones's Naturals.
[03:16:38.549 --> 03:16:42.690]  Vitamin-mineral fusion is back in stock and on sale at Dr. Jones's Naturals.
[03:16:43.569 --> 03:16:46.030]  Alex was trying to read through the list of ingredients.
[03:16:46.270 --> 03:16:49.309]  And there's literally too many ingredients to even list in a single...
[03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:50.870]  I think it's 34. It's everything the body needs, Harrison.
[03:16:51.430 --> 03:16:52.129]  It's like...
[03:16:52.159 --> 03:16:54.200]  100 times more than everything the body needs.
[03:16:54.340 --> 03:16:55.020]  It's amazing.
[03:16:55.260 --> 03:17:04.840]  You're getting, in terms of vitamin C, you're getting 1,667% of your daily value intake, which, you know, that just means minimum.
[03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:12.659]  You're getting Nancy Pelosi stock return level percentages on your supplements with vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:14.180]  Of course, this is just, it's a fan favorite.
[03:17:14.340 --> 03:17:15.100]  People love this.
[03:17:15.159 --> 03:17:20.219]  Anytime it's out of stock, People will call into my show just to ask where the hell it is because they need another can.
[03:17:20.559 --> 03:17:21.700]  So buy it now.
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:22.680]  Wait, is it already?
[03:17:23.139 --> 03:17:24.440]  Have we already sold out?
[03:17:24.639 --> 03:17:25.500]  Am I already pitching something?
[03:17:25.659 --> 03:17:25.819]  No, you can get it.
[03:17:25.819 --> 03:17:28.719]  That's got to be old because it's back in stock and it's just arrived.
[03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:29.639]  I know it's popular.
[03:17:29.780 --> 03:17:30.959]  It can't be that popular though.
[03:17:31.360 --> 03:17:37.399]  But even in this one package is over a month of supply for vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:17:37.540 --> 03:17:52.719]  It is incredible and it does help us Very directly in starting whatever comes next or continuing operations here at Infowars, whatever is decided by the, in my unprofessional opinion, completely arbitrary decisions of the court,
[03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:59.180]  because I can't make heads or tails of what's happening when I'm listening into the hearings, but I guess they'll tell us one way or another.
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:03.819]  It could be today, could be tomorrow, they could reset the auction, and it could be a month from now.
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:04.520]  We just don't know.
[03:18:04.659 --> 03:18:05.000]  We're...
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:07.399]  At the mercy of their whims.
[03:18:07.700 --> 03:18:17.879]  And so we're glad to still be on air and we will continue to cover the hard-hitting news and continue to deliver you the all-American spirit that we try to bring to the table every single day.
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:20.620]  Now, I got all sorts of stuff to talk about.
[03:18:21.540 --> 03:18:22.739]  What's on your mind today, Chase?
[03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:30.440]  Well, I've been focusing relentlessly on this Luigi Mangione thing, but I work at Infowars, so every day World War III is a topic of conversation.
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:30.860]  Yeah.
[03:18:30.979 --> 03:18:34.040]  I've seen major escalations overseas and basically everywhere.
[03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:37.459]  It's very interesting.
[03:18:37.459 --> 03:18:42.819]  What I've really been paying attention to since we won the election at the beginning of November is how...
[03:18:44.889 --> 03:18:55.389]  The rats, Republicans against Trump, are having a really hard time hiding now with these nominations for different offices, whether it's Kash Patel or whether it's Hegseth.
[03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:59.590]  We're really starting to see which Republicans are the problem.
[03:18:59.750 --> 03:19:06.530]  And now that we've defeated the left, all that's left is eradicating the parasites from our own party.
[03:19:06.629 --> 03:19:08.370]  This is no longer a neocon party.
[03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:09.690]  This is not a warmongering party.
[03:19:09.790 --> 03:19:11.989]  This is a mega populist party now.
[03:19:12.129 --> 03:19:23.090]  And what we have to do is just make sure that we Don't allow any of them to be subversive and sneak into the good graces of Trump only to sabotage his administration.
[03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:30.489]  Speaking of that, apparently Mitch McConnell fell at a GOP lunch and has been rushed off.
[03:19:30.629 --> 03:19:31.350]  Apparently he's okay.
[03:19:31.549 --> 03:19:32.790]  Apparently he's in his office.
[03:19:33.010 --> 03:19:33.909]  The shell broke the fall.
[03:19:34.430 --> 03:19:40.469]  Yeah, apparently he is having another health emergency.
[03:19:41.149 --> 03:19:48.250]  This time he's not just freezing in place while in the middle of a sentence, but the fact is the man's too old and he needs to go away.
[03:19:48.370 --> 03:20:18.049]  But there's something about these guys that they have some compulsion to exercise their institutional power, even when it doesn't benefit their side, doesn't benefit the country, and doesn't even benefit We're good to go.
[03:20:18.420 --> 03:20:20.920]  He went farther right, and he brought the country along with him.
[03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:23.500]  And so I don't even get what's going through these guys' heads.
[03:20:23.620 --> 03:20:26.219]  It's like, okay, they're exercising this institutional power.
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:27.600]  They're self-important.
[03:20:27.719 --> 03:20:28.399]  They're egotistical.
[03:20:28.559 --> 03:20:29.280]  They're narcissistic.
[03:20:29.420 --> 03:20:33.819]  They want to feel important, and they want to prove that you need their permission to get anything done.
[03:20:33.879 --> 03:20:37.260]  But it's like, you keep that up, you're going to be out on your butt next primary.
[03:20:37.399 --> 03:20:38.219]  I don't understand...
[03:20:39.090 --> 03:20:45.389]  Why even just for their own, you know, career, they wouldn't go along with Trump and help us get these confirmations.
[03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:46.930]  Now, apparently the confirmations are going through.
[03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:50.209]  The latest from Tom Cotton and others is that they have the votes.
[03:20:50.329 --> 03:20:54.729]  The Senate is going to go along with Trump's agenda and basically everybody's going to be confirmed.
[03:20:54.909 --> 03:21:02.790]  I know Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth are on Capitol Hill, like Kash Patel as well, I think, meeting with senators, you know, shoring up support because they got to get behind Trump.
[03:21:02.969 --> 03:21:03.770]  He won the mandate.
[03:21:03.989 --> 03:21:27.569]  The man got shot in the head on live TV. Well, I think what we're seeing,
[03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:35.889]  both from the right and the left, is The difference between politicians who are employees and politicians who are leaders.
[03:21:36.549 --> 03:21:41.489]  Politicians who have a CEO leadership mindset versus just following the orders of the deep state.
[03:21:41.569 --> 03:21:49.049]  So you have the McConnell's, you have the Lindsey Graham's, you have the Fetterman's, you have the Kamala Harris's, all sides of the political spectrum.
[03:21:49.350 --> 03:21:58.350]  These are people who work for committees, who work for special interests, who obey the intelligence community basically blindly because they're either blackmailed or naive, right?
[03:21:58.729 --> 03:22:01.250]  Or they feel powerful and get power from that.
[03:22:01.389 --> 03:22:31.309]  And so I think the reason that the McCain's feel comfortable wheeling in to vote coming out of brain surgery and the McConnell's feel comfortable standing at a podium even though they're frozen and the Kamala Harris's feel comfortable posting videos clearly inebriated and the John Fetterman's feel comfortable running after they just have a stroke and communicating through a machine like Stephen Hawking only without the IQ. Is because it doesn't really matter what they think or how competent they are or who they are if they're just following orders.
[03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:32.829]  They're soldiers for the deep state.
[03:22:33.069 --> 03:22:40.829]  And so I think that's the mindset that's just, it's gotta go because these leadership positions are so important.
[03:22:41.049 --> 03:22:49.450]  I mean, we're talking top 1,000, top 5,000, top 10,000 most powerful people in the world in the House and in the Senate.
[03:22:49.629 --> 03:23:02.250]  And to just fill that seat and kind of Go with the flow of whatever the machine wants you to do is such a waste of opportunity where leadership could be exercised and real change could be made.
[03:23:02.409 --> 03:23:09.829]  And I think finally we're reaching a point where the American people are really sick of politicians who are employees instead of politicians who are leaders.
[03:23:10.520 --> 03:23:11.040]  I agree.
[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:14.620]  And it seems like everybody's at least getting the message.
[03:23:14.879 --> 03:23:16.840]  Obviously, World War III is still very much on.
[03:23:16.940 --> 03:23:24.180]  The deep state is still doing everything they possibly can to bring about some sort of catastrophic nuclear war before Trump gets in.
[03:23:24.260 --> 03:23:26.520]  I think Syria was definitely a part of that.
[03:23:26.659 --> 03:23:30.979]  I think the reason that you saw this insane blitzkrieg where in eight days...
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:36.200]  The entire state of Syria is taken over by this mob of terrorists.
[03:23:37.059 --> 03:23:43.659]  It's because they want to get it done before Trump gets in office because they know that Trump is going to cut their budgets and stop them from doing this type of stuff.
[03:23:44.239 --> 03:23:47.000]  But it's already having massive backlash.
[03:23:47.059 --> 03:23:54.799]  It used to be that we'd invade Iraq and it was a big rah-rah, we won George Bush with a big victory banner behind him celebrating.
[03:23:55.020 --> 03:23:59.399]  And then it would be years later that people would sort of look back and go, gee, that's sort of a hellhole now.
[03:23:59.500 --> 03:24:00.739]  In Libya, it took a couple years.
[03:24:00.739 --> 03:24:03.110]  Wait, how many Yeah, right.
[03:24:03.370 --> 03:24:04.309]  And Libya.
[03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:07.409]  It took a couple years before the slave market started up.
[03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:10.610]  It seems like it's not taking so long in Syria.
[03:24:10.829 --> 03:24:16.309]  From the cradle, extremist groups carry out revenge sectarian killings in HTS-controlled Syria.
[03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:22.290]  There's videos coming out of women saying they stepped outside and immediately had somebody from this HTS group.
[03:24:22.549 --> 03:24:23.770]  Demand they put on a hijab.
[03:24:23.930 --> 03:24:36.430]  So they're already implementing much more strict Islamic Sharia law type rule, which Syria had avoided because Assad as an Alawite was more of a moderate Muslim and actually helped protect some of the minorities in Syria like the Christians.
[03:24:37.489 --> 03:24:41.489]  So it's already, and we're not going to show you the videos, but they're out there.
[03:24:41.629 --> 03:24:48.870]  They're on X. Dozens of summary executions have been reported across the country since former Al-Qaeda and ISIS leaders took control of Damascus.
[03:24:50.110 --> 03:24:54.309]  And the way they're trying to brand this is just pathetic.
[03:24:54.489 --> 03:25:00.450]  From Information Liberation, the Telegraph touts the diversity-friendly jihadist tearing through Syria.
[03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:08.049]  And this is the headline from the Telegraph, how Syria's diversity-friendly jihadists plan on building a state.
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:11.260]  Yeah, they're on a jihad.
[03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:16.420]  They're on a holy war for Allah, but also they love diversity.
[03:25:16.559 --> 03:25:17.879]  So can they really be that bad?
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:20.920]  I mean, it's insane how they're trying to spin this.
[03:25:21.020 --> 03:25:22.040]  I don't think it's going to work.
[03:25:22.159 --> 03:25:28.879]  I think they're still running this legacy operating system where they think they can pull this off, but the American people aren't going to buy it.
[03:25:29.100 --> 03:25:30.540]  They're not going along with it.
[03:25:30.819 --> 03:25:32.840]  And here's another act of desperation.
[03:25:33.299 --> 03:25:37.959]  Terrorist label of Syria's new rulers will need to be considered, says UN envoy.
[03:25:38.979 --> 03:25:50.200]  Even now, I believe in the official U.S. government websites, the leader who now sits atop Syria is listed as a wanted terrorist whose head will get you $10 million.
[03:25:50.459 --> 03:25:52.299]  He's wanted with a $10 million bounty.
[03:25:52.840 --> 03:26:00.739]  But they're saying, now that you did what we want, now that we want to pretend that you're the good guys, maybe we need to rethink this whole terrorist label.
[03:26:00.840 --> 03:26:01.239]  Not that...
[03:26:01.709 --> 03:26:11.610]  You aren't terrorists, not that anything you did in the past that made you terrorist has changed, but now that you're in charge of Syria, we want to play nice and we're going to reconsider the label of terrorism for you.
[03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:27.709]  So again, I just think their grip is slipping, and it's almost like the harder they squeeze, the more we slip through their fingers, and we being just the human people of Earth and American people in particular, but just understanding the level of deception that we're up against and how blatant their deception is,
[03:26:27.809 --> 03:26:29.569]  it's just not working anymore.
[03:26:31.069 --> 03:26:37.430]  It'll be interesting to see how they try to change their tactics, and they really should have changed them already, because nobody's falling for this crap anymore.
[03:26:38.329 --> 03:26:38.950]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[03:26:39.090 --> 03:26:46.690]  It's interesting that you mention the post-9-11 zeitgeist in the United States and the hoorah about Afghanistan and Iraq.
[03:26:46.690 --> 03:26:48.409]  I have a distinct memory.
[03:26:48.409 --> 03:26:49.969]  I was 11 years old when 9-11 happened.
[03:26:50.530 --> 03:26:59.670]  I have a distinct memory of walking into my parents' bedroom within a few weeks of 9-11, and my dad was listening to the radio.
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:01.440]  I don't remember who it was.
[03:27:01.559 --> 03:27:02.040]  It was talk radio.
[03:27:02.399 --> 03:27:08.280]  And I remember they were reporting on the ongoing bombing of Kabul, a major city in Afghanistan.
[03:27:08.659 --> 03:27:10.899]  And I remember the radio host said, Kabul?
[03:27:11.159 --> 03:27:12.379]  More like, kaboom!
[03:27:13.239 --> 03:27:15.399]  And then everyone was like, ha ha ha ha ha!
[03:27:15.639 --> 03:27:17.399]  And I'm looking back, I'm like, you bomb a city?
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:17.940]  Yeah.
[03:27:18.379 --> 03:27:18.819]  That's...
[03:27:19.290 --> 03:27:23.110]  But inevitably there's innocent people that are just dying because people live in cities.
[03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:24.450]  It's not just military targets.
[03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:25.610]  And I don't know.
[03:27:25.870 --> 03:27:36.049]  I'm not somebody who's a pacifist because I've always felt that people who are blindly pacifists have a tendency to be too sympathetic and kind of weak and naive because I think war is necessary sometimes.
[03:27:36.670 --> 03:27:41.510]  But I absolutely 100% believe that it should be avoided at all costs.
[03:27:41.709 --> 03:27:43.129]  I mean, it's the ugliest thing ever.
[03:27:43.229 --> 03:27:44.030]  I can't even imagine.
[03:27:44.270 --> 03:27:47.450]  I know that you have to experience it to really know what it's like.
[03:27:47.809 --> 03:28:03.180]  But It is so bad that I can't even grasp the audacity of our leaders like Lindsey Graham or others who are just constantly advocating for boots on the ground in every single region.
[03:28:03.399 --> 03:28:04.479]  Who treated so flippantly.
[03:28:04.719 --> 03:28:05.520]  It's so flippant.
[03:28:05.620 --> 03:28:14.059]  And I know that there was a proposed amendment to the Constitution many, many years ago, many decades ago, that would have forced politicians who voted in favor of war to enlist.
[03:28:14.969 --> 03:28:16.350]  Yeah, I know that one.
[03:28:16.409 --> 03:28:17.930]  I think it was actually a plebiscite.
[03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:24.010]  So everybody in America of age would have to vote, and you would be enlisted if you voted, yes.
[03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:38.270]  But the problem is, war has changed since World War II, in that it used to be that if you went to war and you lost, whether you were a leader, whether you were rich, whether you were poor, It was devastating economically, socially, supply chain, whatever.
[03:28:38.489 --> 03:28:39.049]  It was a terrible thing.
[03:28:39.329 --> 03:28:40.049]  Kings would go to war.
[03:28:40.149 --> 03:28:41.170]  They'd actually fight in the battles.
[03:28:41.350 --> 03:28:43.370]  And if you lost the battle, you lost land.
[03:28:43.370 --> 03:28:44.190]  It was painful.
[03:28:44.370 --> 03:28:46.350]  I mean, you actually lost wealth.
[03:28:46.610 --> 03:28:52.350]  But now, with the military-industrial complex set up the way that it is, winning a war is no longer the objective.
[03:28:52.629 --> 03:28:53.989]  It's not even really relevant.
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:28:59.440]  It's waging and perpetuating the wars that are the most lucrative for the contractors.
[03:28:59.739 --> 03:29:02.879]  And so people say, oh, the United States hasn't won a war in the last 80 years.
[03:29:02.879 --> 03:29:06.299]  It's not because we're militaristically inferior.
[03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:09.620]  It's because winning the war was never really the goal.
[03:29:09.819 --> 03:29:12.940]  The goal was just to destroy and rebuild, destroy and rebuild, and arm, arm.
[03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:24.139]  And I can't remember what the exact statistic is, Harrison, but I believe for every enemy combatant killed in the Middle East, it's estimated that 180,000 to 250,000 rounds were fired.
[03:29:25.809 --> 03:29:27.670]  I mean, just look at all that money, man.
[03:29:28.190 --> 03:29:28.870]  All that money.
[03:29:29.790 --> 03:29:42.190]  I see these conflicts and I understand that Making a play against the establishment in Syria is really kind of an affront to Iran, and that Iran is seen as a threat to Israel and the dollar as a global reserve currency.
[03:29:42.350 --> 03:29:48.909]  And so this seems to me to be inching in between Israel and the United States and other allies, so-called allies.
[03:29:49.290 --> 03:29:53.170]  This is inching into a hot escalation with Iran.
[03:29:53.290 --> 03:29:59.850]  I think that our deep state is trying to undermine Iran at every step of the way, and eventually it's going to lead to a real bloody conflict.
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:16.629]  I think they're trying to get it done before Trump gets into office because Trump has reiterated over and over he doesn't want overseas wars and I mean you look at what has happened in Syria and the speed at which it was executed And the outcome of this,
[03:30:16.770 --> 03:30:21.950]  I mean, what it is is it's broken what the Israelis call the Shia Crescent, what the people involved called the Axis of Resistance.
[03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:29.370]  It was that basically a singular land mass that stretched from Iran to Iraq to Syria to Lebanon.
[03:30:30.129 --> 03:30:35.030]  And Hezbollah, of course, in Lebanon has basically depopulated the north of Israel.
[03:30:35.209 --> 03:30:36.250]  They're totally unproductive.
[03:30:36.510 --> 03:30:38.049]  There's nobody in the north of Israel now.
[03:30:38.190 --> 03:30:41.329]  They're displaced, over 100,000 refugees in their own country.
[03:30:41.409 --> 03:30:42.909]  That's unsustainable for Israel.
[03:30:42.909 --> 03:30:49.899]  It's really a life or death issue to Totally get rid of Hezbollah because the people there, they aren't saying, oh, if you get a ceasefire, we'll go back.
[03:30:50.040 --> 03:30:52.459]  They're saying, no, if there's any risk, we're not going back.
[03:30:52.459 --> 03:30:54.520]  We're not going to go back and man the farms.
[03:30:54.540 --> 03:30:57.079]  We're just going to leave that part of the country totally unproductive.
[03:30:57.219 --> 03:30:59.459]  They really just can't afford that to go on forever.
[03:31:00.059 --> 03:31:04.360]  They could not break into Lebanon because of just the geography and everything.
[03:31:04.959 --> 03:31:09.440]  And so they are, I think the fall of Syria was a boon to that.
[03:31:09.520 --> 03:31:13.819]  But then you've got Israel bombing the people that are in Syria now.
[03:31:14.719 --> 03:31:16.100]  You guys have done a great job.
[03:31:17.379 --> 03:31:19.000]  I hope the judge does the right thing.
[03:31:19.920 --> 03:31:20.700]  But it's all up in the air.
[03:31:20.760 --> 03:31:21.639]  We could be shut down tonight.
[03:31:21.819 --> 03:31:27.680]  Chris Murray has told people here they're going to cut the internet off tonight, give the judge rules the sale went through.
[03:31:28.139 --> 03:31:31.780]  So I just realized this could be the last time on my own show.
[03:31:31.979 --> 03:31:32.739]  I appreciate you guys doing the hour.
[03:31:32.739 --> 03:31:34.059]  I was listening to all this to take care of stuff.
[03:31:34.639 --> 03:31:40.719]  So I kind of want to run a promo for a minute here in a few minutes and just come in and say some last words out of here in case that happens.
[03:31:40.920 --> 03:31:41.399]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:31:41.680 --> 03:31:41.920]  Absolutely.
[03:31:42.200 --> 03:31:43.959]  And maybe get the Frank Sinatra ready in my way.
[03:31:45.369 --> 03:31:46.250]  Making our own death.
[03:31:46.370 --> 03:31:47.510]  Except it's all completely real.
[03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:49.409]  They bring us to the edge of destruction each time.
[03:31:49.489 --> 03:31:50.569]  You guys have done a great job, by the way.
[03:31:50.770 --> 03:31:51.250]  No, thank you.
[03:31:51.450 --> 03:31:53.950]  This is real, folks, and this is how fast things change.
[03:31:54.049 --> 03:31:54.790]  Let's go to that promo.
[03:31:54.989 --> 03:31:56.370]  Nothing bad's happened.
[03:31:56.489 --> 03:31:59.129]  It's not like I just realized, wait, we could be shut down tonight.
[03:31:59.129 --> 03:32:00.229]  Who knows how this ruling will go?
[03:32:00.649 --> 03:32:03.670]  And I was like, wow, I'm getting really nostalgic here.
[03:32:04.049 --> 03:32:05.969]  Like, wow, they actually kick us out of here.
[03:32:06.030 --> 03:32:06.889]  This is so sad.
[03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:08.510]  Anyways, I'm kind of doing it right now.
[03:32:09.159 --> 03:32:09.459]  It's okay.
[03:32:09.799 --> 03:32:10.559]  Have a seat, Alex.
[03:32:10.760 --> 03:32:11.219]  No, no, no.
[03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:16.239]  You guys have a few more minutes, and they're going to hear a little short promo that McRain did, and I'm going to come in.
[03:32:16.319 --> 03:32:16.600]  All right.
[03:32:16.940 --> 03:32:17.760]  All right, sounds good.
[03:32:17.879 --> 03:32:18.899]  Yeah, folks, look, this is real.
[03:32:18.979 --> 03:32:25.659]  And I'll tell you, I remember the first time I stepped into this room, no screens, no TVs, no cameras.
[03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:31.680]  The room that's now a control room was where the reporters sat and did work.
[03:32:31.700 --> 03:32:32.940]  At the time, there was only one show.
[03:32:33.079 --> 03:32:34.340]  It was just the Alex Jones show.
[03:32:34.340 --> 03:32:36.899]  And I think maybe we were doing nightly news at that point.
[03:32:37.059 --> 03:32:40.540]  But to see Infowars' growth over the last, I've been here for seven years.
[03:32:40.719 --> 03:32:42.360]  I mean, this room was amazing.
[03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:45.809]  They were packaging supplements in here and shipping them out.
[03:32:45.889 --> 03:32:47.670]  And then that moved and then that had to move elsewhere.
[03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:50.409]  We've just grown and grown and grown in advance, advance, advance.
[03:32:50.610 --> 03:32:55.770]  We've done it in total opposition to all of their attempts to shut us down, to limit us, to kick us off the Internet.
[03:32:55.989 --> 03:32:59.969]  At the same time, you've got MSNBC and CNN just collapsing into failure.
[03:33:00.530 --> 03:33:03.450]  Infowars continues to rise and we will as long as you support us.
[03:33:03.549 --> 03:33:07.209]  And I can't express how much I appreciate the support of you.
[03:33:07.399 --> 03:33:12.360]  Of everybody who goes to InfoWarsStore.com and the Alex Jones store and Dr. Jones's Naturals.
[03:33:12.579 --> 03:33:14.059]  It really does mean everything to us.
[03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:14.799]  Absolutely.
[03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:18.600]  Well, this is where I first met Alex, in this chair, sitting right here.
[03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:21.700]  I came on as a guest for an hour to talk about artificial intelligence.
[03:33:22.159 --> 03:33:24.780]  And I'll never forget, he was talking about his wife.
[03:33:24.899 --> 03:33:26.540]  And he's like, she's like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[03:33:27.139 --> 03:33:28.600]  He was trying to say that she was fit.
[03:33:29.340 --> 03:33:30.620]  I was like, oh, he's a handsome dude.
[03:33:30.680 --> 03:33:31.579]  He's like, I didn't mean it like that.
[03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:41.670]  I'll never forget that, but this is a magical place, and no matter what happens, this is just the beginning of the Infowar.
[03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:42.309]  Absolutely.
[03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:45.409]  All right, let's go ahead and roll that promo and let Alex have the final words here.
[03:33:45.489 --> 03:33:45.909]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:33:46.030 --> 03:33:47.250]  I'm Harrison Smith, Chase Geyser.
[03:33:47.930 --> 03:33:58.190]  The entire world is racing into the fourth turning and the greatest quickening our species has seen in 10,000 years of recorded history.
[03:34:00.569 --> 03:34:01.989]  You know you're in a war, right?
[03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:04.040]  And it's a declared war.
[03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:06.020]  The globalists have declared war on team humanity.
[03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:08.420]  They've declared war on the God that made us.
[03:34:09.139 --> 03:34:10.860]  It is not incredible.
[03:34:11.139 --> 03:34:12.059]  It is not heroic.
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:14.520]  It is not amazing to fight this.
[03:34:14.700 --> 03:34:15.979]  It is survival.
[03:34:17.159 --> 03:34:19.260]  This is the priority.
[03:34:19.879 --> 03:34:21.239]  This is the real world.
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:22.139]  This is game time.
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:24.059]  This is the crossroads of human destiny.
[03:34:24.260 --> 03:34:24.620]  Right now.
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:25.420]  Right now.
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:31.020]  And I see a bunch of other people not realizing how desperate the situation is!
[03:34:31.399 --> 03:34:33.239]  We need maximum urgency!
[03:34:33.659 --> 03:34:36.559]  We're up against the most evil people the world's ever seen!
[03:34:36.620 --> 03:34:37.899]  Don't you understand that?
[03:34:38.500 --> 03:34:40.819]  I don't want anybody to go out and be physically violent.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:42.799]  I want you to kill with truth!
[03:34:43.059 --> 03:34:44.340]  Kill with your will!
[03:34:44.559 --> 03:34:45.059]  Kill!
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:45.739]  Kill!
[03:34:45.979 --> 03:34:47.100]  Kill their lies!
[03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:09.139]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:11.520]  You better believe you've got one!
[03:35:13.399 --> 03:35:18.639]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:35.360]  I appreciate Harrison Smith.
[03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:38.840]  The Chase guys are doing a great job here in the fourth hour.
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:42.059]  And Owen Troyer is coming up in four minutes exactly with the War Room.
[03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:43.760]  Also at Infowars.com.
[03:35:44.860 --> 03:35:46.459]  That could all be gone tonight.
[03:35:46.739 --> 03:35:56.059]  The Justice Department that's coming to the bankruptcy is in court trying to justify their fake bids and all the weird crap they did and the scams.
[03:35:56.520 --> 03:36:02.790]  And I can't imagine the judge is going to let them do this, but He was supposed to rule yesterday, extended the hearings today.
[03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:07.229]  They're just up there just trying to normalize everything they did.
[03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:11.889]  And regardless of what happens, we're going to keep fighting because I know you're going to stand with us.
[03:36:11.969 --> 03:36:17.090]  But I wanted to just say a few things here before this broadcast ends.
[03:36:17.549 --> 03:36:20.350]  I've been in this time slot from 11 a.m.
[03:36:20.690 --> 03:36:21.469]  to 3 p.m.
[03:36:21.629 --> 03:36:24.649]  for 26 years.
[03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:28.409]  And I've been on air 30, almost 31 years.
[03:36:28.709 --> 03:36:29.829]  And I just love the crew.
[03:36:29.930 --> 03:36:32.270]  I love the viewers, the listeners who are men and women in the arena.
[03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:35.489]  And it's just been an epic fight no matter what happens.
[03:36:35.610 --> 03:36:47.450]  And there's been multiple times You know, that they tried to shut us down and it looks so close, but because of your prayer, because of the support you gave us together in this fight, this family, we were able to fight through that.
[03:36:47.569 --> 03:36:52.989]  But every time we're brought right to the edge, I don't take any of this for granted.
[03:36:53.569 --> 03:36:55.809]  So we wouldn't have lasted this long without you.
[03:36:55.909 --> 03:36:58.629]  We'll continue to fight on with your support and with your word of mouth and prayer.
[03:36:59.399 --> 03:37:03.059]  But I wanted to just thank the crew and all the viewers and listeners for everything you've done.
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:07.940]  The globalists are in free fall, as Harrison said, CNN, MSNBC. They're all collapsing.
[03:37:07.940 --> 03:37:10.420]  They're all falling apart, no matter how many billions they have.
[03:37:10.959 --> 03:37:13.219]  The globalists are a joke, and the world's waking up to them.
[03:37:13.319 --> 03:37:20.120]  So the globalists are trying to start World War III and race war and release new viruses and the UFO scares, Blue Beam.
[03:37:20.379 --> 03:37:23.000]  I mean, they're going wild, but that's because they're weak.
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:25.899]  And so we have the initiative.
[03:37:25.899 --> 03:37:26.739]  We're turning the tide.
[03:37:26.879 --> 03:37:27.940]  We're really starting to win.
[03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:30.120]  And so I pledge to you that I'll never give up.
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:30.659]  I'll never surrender.
[03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:31.440]  I'll never back down.
[03:37:32.280 --> 03:37:34.420]  And that you are the wind in our sails here.
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:37.540]  You are the reason that we're able to keep doing this.
[03:37:37.639 --> 03:37:39.940]  You know, our spirit's strong, but the flesh is weak.
[03:37:40.040 --> 03:37:47.680]  And you are what backs up the temporal level in the real third dimension of supporting this operation, the studios, and what we do.
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:52.370]  And the Alex Jones Network that set up, follow us at AJN on X, That will continue on.
[03:37:52.829 --> 03:37:56.229]  The bad guys are going to continue to harass and harry us, but we'll never give up.
[03:37:56.329 --> 03:37:59.909]  And I know we're going to win thanks to your support, and I'm stronger than ever.
[03:38:00.049 --> 03:38:03.989]  But I couldn't have done it without my family, and that's the listeners and viewers.
[03:38:04.270 --> 03:38:09.049]  Without the crew, that's my family as well, but without my physical blood family as well.
[03:38:09.170 --> 03:38:19.090]  And so I would just ask everybody, in closing, to say a prayer for peace, to say a prayer for President Trump, to say a prayer for InfoWars, to say a prayer for the world, that the awakening continues.
[03:38:20.129 --> 03:38:26.530]  And that God's will be done in the next few hours, the next few days.
[03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:35.489]  I don't know how long this will go on with this nail-biting federal courthouse in Houston where the fate of this storied operation hangs in the balance.
[03:38:35.629 --> 03:38:37.909]  But regardless, the information war belongs to the people.
[03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:46.770]  The website Infowars.com is important, but the fact that there's a war on firm minds in the information war...
[03:38:47.739 --> 03:38:48.799]  It is a fact.
[03:38:49.020 --> 03:38:51.639]  And that belongs to the people and we have the initiative and we're winning.
[03:38:51.819 --> 03:38:53.040]  So God, thank you for everything.
[03:38:53.540 --> 03:38:55.899]  Thank you for the gift of consciousness and for leading and guiding and directing us.
[03:38:56.079 --> 03:39:00.739]  And if it is your will, please have the truth come out about this fraudulent auction.
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:05.760]  Please have the good guys get it so we can continue on in these studios and not be diverted or distracted from our war.
[03:39:05.819 --> 03:39:07.639]  But we know it's all part of your larger plan.
[03:39:07.819 --> 03:39:09.280]  So whatever happens, we thank you.
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:10.180]  We will continue to fight.
[03:39:10.340 --> 03:39:13.559]  And we just are so appreciative that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die for our sins.
[03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:16.799]  And so just, we're doing it God's way.
[03:39:16.879 --> 03:39:21.729]  We're doing it The way that we were designed to by God.
[03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:25.569]  And so I hope we're still here tomorrow, but we can be shut down tonight.
[03:39:26.030 --> 03:39:28.770]  Regardless, I'll be giving you updates on the war room and then after.
[03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:33.590]  And I'll be on the air if the judge hands it over to them to the last minute when they cut the internet off.
[03:39:33.930 --> 03:39:36.129]  And then we'll be back tomorrow from the Alex Jones studios.
[03:39:36.290 --> 03:39:37.329]  But we don't know what's going to happen yet.
[03:39:37.649 --> 03:39:39.370]  So God bless you all.
[03:39:47.729 --> 03:39:55.489]  I've got a very simple but important, powerful, and completely truthful proposal for you.
[03:39:56.350 --> 03:39:57.829]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
