[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.669]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.109]  It's Wednesday, November 13th.
[00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.129]  I'm taping this at approximately 10.30 a.m.
[00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.469]  Central.
[00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.769]  That means the federally ordered bankruptcy auction of Infowars has now closed.
[00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:27.730]  10.30 Central.
[00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.890]  We're told we won't learn for hours.
[00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.880]  Maybe even till tomorrow morning what the results are.
[00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.240]  But regardless, we are going to continue on in the fight against the globalists even if InfoWars is shut down at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:54.399]  Be sure to follow me at RealAlexJonesOnX and at AJNLive for the Alex Jones Network for updates, breaking news, because the fight against the globalists doesn't stop now, it only accelerates.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.780]  John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy, was engaging a British ship over twice its size with twice the men.
[00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.079]  His ship was under fire, on fire, and sinking.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.400]  The British captain hailed across and said, we're going to give you quarters.
[00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.239]  Do you want to surrender?
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.659]  And he said, I have only begun to fight.
[00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.500]  And he meant it.
[00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.480]  They rammed into the ship, they took the ship by force, and they took it.
[00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.939]  And then he went on to found the U.S. Navy.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.579]  So, I'll quote him.
[00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.890]  I have not yet begun to fight.
[00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:39.629]  Please follow me at RedLogShowsOnX and please support our sponsor, TheAlogShowStore.com with incredible supplements, knives, great patron apparel and more because that's our sponsor funding the new operation if we get shut down today.
[00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.469]  If we don't get shut down, we'll roll it all into InfoWars and fight the globalists that much stronger.
[00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:46.769]  The only way we lose is by giving up.
[00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.170]  We never surrender and we're winning.
[00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.329]  We've turned the tide.
[00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.379]  So in the words of our great 47th president, Fight!
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.879]  Fight!
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.379]  Fight!
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.659]  This is it.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.539]  Potentially the last day at the Infowars studios in South Austin.
[00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.340]  It's Wednesday, November 13th, 2024.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.780]  The auction is now closed.
[00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.080]  We will soon discover who bought Infowars.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.759]  Infowars.
[00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.939]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.560]  Today.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:35.159]  Just a little less than an hour and a half ago, President Trump, exiled by the deep state, returned triumphantly to the swamp in Washington, D.C. on the Potomac.
[00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:44.400]  He then met just minutes ago with the puppet president that was the front man for the globalists that stole the election in 2020.
[00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.050]  Now the evidence has all been documented and we've caught them redheaded stealing some House and Senate races.
[00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.189]  That's being exposed right now by Elon Musk and others.
[00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:04.590]  The government efficiency department is sending the left into absolute conniption fits.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.520]  All over the world, not just here.
[00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:20.280]  The population is waking up to the private central banks and their anti-human depopulation transhumanist death cult agenda.
[00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:28.719]  Let's back up this short exchange with President Trump and puppet Biden and actually hear what they had to say.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.800]  Here it is.
[00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.639]  Well, Mr.
[00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.300]  President-elect and former president, Donald, congratulations.
[00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:36.199]  Thank you very much.
[00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:44.719]  And I'm looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition to everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need.
[00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.319]  And we're going to get a chance to talk about some of that today.
[00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.740]  It's good.
[00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.699]  Welcome.
[00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.520]  Thank you very much.
[00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.780]  And politics is tough.
[00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.349]  And it's, in many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much.
[00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.069]  A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, Jim.
[00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.810]  You're welcome.
[00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:18.149]  All right, it's obviously major national, international news, the attempted destruction of Infowars.
[00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:27.319]  The people that wanted to shut down the Democratic Party that ran the lawfare against me are on record, but we have a compilation of them, a short one.
[00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.259]  We've got some longer ones, too.
[00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:34.259]  We get the three-minute one where they say their mission is to silence me and take me off the air.
[00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.899]  I want to play that when we come back.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.939]  But the auction that was going to be public online with a major auction company...
[00:04:45.029 --> 00:05:00.209]  I learned Monday afternoon that the person in charge of that assigned by the bankruptcy judge made the decision to have it sealed and not public, and to just have people put in bids,
[00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.709]  and then whoever is the highest gets it.
[00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.290]  That doesn't really sound like an auction to me, and then we're told we'll never know what the other bids were, so how do you know you put in bids?
[00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.449]  The highest, or how do you know you put in the lowest?
[00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.730]  Very interesting things happening right now.
[00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.730]  We could be told any time.
[00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:32.790]  At 10.30 Central, 33 minutes ago was when, supposedly, they opened the sealed bids, and then the folks that I'm working with that are trying to buy InfoWars...
[00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.600]  They talked to the company and they said, well, you could be told in the next few hours tonight, but you shouldn't be for sure told by tomorrow morning.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.560]  I also love some of the people out there.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.860]  I see it quite a bit like, are they really trying to shut you down?
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]  I mean, is this really happening?
[00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.529]  Because we've survived so many times I've never cried wolf.
[00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.730]  Everything I've told you usually broke ourselves, came out to be true later.
[00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:10.209]  Like, in late May, just on a Friday, there's all these armed security showing up, and they say, well, we've been told to kick you out of the building and close the doors tonight, take you off the air.
[00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.470]  And I said, well, where's the judge's order?
[00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.110]  There was no order.
[00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.329]  So we got an emergency hearing, and the judge fired the federal U.S. trustee and the CRO. They had no authority.
[00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.470]  And I said, this isn't about me.
[00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.930]  They're getting ready to try to kill Trump.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.779]  And you saw what happened.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.740]  That was in late May, June.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.519]  That all went down.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.000]  And then you saw what happened on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.060]  So real vigilantism.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.360]  I'm not saying the new trustee is bad.
[00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:42.740]  He does not have a bad name.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.420]  He has a name.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.920]  It's just a guy that follows it by the book.
[00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:52.980]  But this is some very unusual stuff going on, according to all the people I've talked to that have been involved in a lot of federal bankruptcies and auctions.
[00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.089]  So I guess, you know, obviously, going after Infowars is not a normal case.
[00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:12.509]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:14.009]  That's what matters.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:26.319]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.939]  That is punishment.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.199]  That is deterrence.
[00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.079]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:01.420]  Getting ready to bounce?
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.279]  Or will you stop it?
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.240]  That's going to be in your hands.
[00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:15.819]  And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back in your asses.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.420]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:26.379]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.050]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:42.870]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.129]  I believe it.
[00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:51.899]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.759]  Yeah, there's gonna be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.879]  And that's also gonna have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:11.909]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards Is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.710]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:16.049]  Jones.
[00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:19.549]  Because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:28.350]  You know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand.
[00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.210]  I can only imagine what federal receiver's going to do.
[00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:34.129]  So yeah, it's gonna get interesting from here on out.
[00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:36.110]  It's gonna get really interesting, that's for sure.
[00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.990]  It's already super interesting, but like we say, it's the end of the beginning.
[00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.230]  And boy, are these clients happy about it.
[00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.549]  There was certainly a message sent out of this courthouse today, that's for sure.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.620]  But we will be at it as long as it takes.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.500]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:14.299]  And to go back to what Robbie Parker said, all Alex Jones does is take from you, exploit you, lie to you.
[00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.110]  Feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust.
[00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.750]  And the only person that benefits in that equation is him.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.230]  Well, that stops.
[00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.789]  That's stopping today, thanks to the courage of these families.
[00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.230]  Thank you very much.
[00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:46.649]  Alright, that was two years ago.
[00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:48.889]  Right at this time of year.
[00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:51.230]  That's when they had the two show trials where I was already found guilty.
[00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.950]  Unprecedented in U.S. history.
[00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:54.070]  HBO scripts.
[00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:56.570]  Couldn't say I was innocent.
[00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.649]  Totally rigged.
[00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:03.049]  And then they said I had hundreds of millions of dollars hidden.
[00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.210]  I was going to go to prison.
[00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.230]  They were going to get me with these federal investigators.
[00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:13.129]  And they had the Justice Department with federal auditors in here for two years.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:19.100]  And they said, you overpaid taxes $4.3 million and the IRS went here.
[00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.940]  Here's your cashier's check for $4.3 million.
[00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.980]  And then that went into the bankruptcy because I was in bankruptcy.
[00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:32.179]  Wow, I overpaid taxes $4.3 million over the five years previous they audited me for.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.399]  One year with the IRS at least here every week, tearing through everything.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.840]  I said...
[00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:40.769]  I said, you know what?
[00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.210]  Because they wanted it in my house.
[00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.649]  I said, I'm leaving.
[00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:45.990]  I said, you want to plant stuff?
[00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:46.429]  Go ahead.
[00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.250]  They're in my house, eight hours.
[00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.370]  Dug through underwear drawers, everything.
[00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:56.230]  Because if they're going to set me up, I was 100% going to have it completely on record.
[00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:04.620]  And They had private investigators and teams trying to set us up.
[00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:09.539]  And then, as you know, back in late May, they tried to come and shut us down without a court order.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.919]  And the judge fired the federal U.S. trustee.
[00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.720]  I mean, just wild stuff.
[00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:19.080]  And I knew in May and June, I said, they're getting ready to kill Trump.
[00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.879]  And one Justice Department lawyer, high level...
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:31.360]  The head of their Texas bureau for the Justice Department's bankruptcy division.
[00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:34.460]  They can oversee any bankruptcy they want.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.960]  They don't usually get involved very rarely.
[00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:37.379]  They got involved in mine heavily.
[00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:39.679]  Deposed me over and over again and everything.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.799]  They sent an email to my lawyers when I first declared bankruptcy and they said, this is coming from the top.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.159]  Mr.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.759]  Jones will not be afforded the bankruptcy system.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.580]  And I wasn't.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.039]  I went through bankruptcy, said, take whatever I got.
[00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:03.679]  They said, nope.
[00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.000]  You're non-dischargeable.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.539]  We'll take anything you've got, and then you still owe us forever.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.460]  You don't have a 13th Amendment.
[00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:15.000]  And in court filings a month ago, you can read it in Reuters and Bloomberg, they said, Mr.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.820]  Jones is special.
[00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:21.059]  The 13th Amendment does not apply to him, close quote, in a federal filing.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.179]  He said, that's crazy.
[00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.360]  They think I'm so demonized.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.440]  That they can set precedence with me for precedence on you.
[00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:40.240]  Yeah, the Bloomberg article had a headline like, Sandy Hook families seek to get Alex Jones' social media.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:51.000]  And then you read into it, including the name Alex Jones and real Alex Jones on X. And they said, the 13th Amendment does not apply to Mr.
[00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:51.480]  Jones.
[00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:55.139]  Actually says it word for word.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:12.720]  Just like the law doesn't apply to Mayorkas and Kamala Harris, in the Senate report out three months ago, 325,000 missing children, many found in slave labor and sex slavery,
[00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:14.000]  and many found dead.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.759]  But the Justice Department said, we're going to do it.
[00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.740]  There's nothing you can do to stop us.
[00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:33.639]  And I've been in meetings with head federal judges over whole sectors Of the country, including Texas, wargaming how we stop this, because the federal judges are blocked by the Justice Department, even prosecuting child traffickers.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.139]  So, they're the bad guys.
[00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.259]  It's all coming out, but here's the big news.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:51.039]  I want to get into all the other news that's happening in the world, and Elon Musk's Office of Government Efficiency, and all the rest of it.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.379]  There's so much big news.
[00:14:53.279 --> 00:15:01.700]  The Democrats have been caught in Wisconsin stealing a key election, red-handed with illegals voting.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.440]  So now it's going to be challenged.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.039]  They've been caught now trying to steal it in Pennsylvania.
[00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:13.659]  I told you, just because they say the Republicans have the House and Senate doesn't mean they're not going to warn out looking while these races are still open.
[00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:16.039]  It doesn't matter if they say 99% of the votes are counted.
[00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:17.519]  They'll find the votes they need.
[00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:25.029]  Democrat Party Senate candidate in Pennsylvania is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting non-citizen votes, which is illegal.
[00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.929]  This has been their goal all along.
[00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:28.970]  They are just flat out openly doing it.
[00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.269]  Committing crime now, says Elon Musk.
[00:15:31.649 --> 00:15:36.210]  And then he links in his tweet to the evidence in the articles and the documents.
[00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.409]  So you go to at Elon Musk.
[00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.250]  If you want to see that, I'm going to repost that on Real Alex Jones.
[00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.169]  And we've got all of that evidence we'll be going through in a little while.
[00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:44.970]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:55.440]  We've got a whole bunch of news vans driving around here, reporters all around the office, a bunch of people showing up here, supporters, you name it.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.840]  I want to explain something.
[00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:04.779]  And I'm not somebody that puts a good face on something when there's not a good face on it.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.940]  My 30 and a half years on air has been an incredible journey.
[00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:18.070]  And God's hand has been on this the entire time, and all glory goes to God, but God working through you, the supporters.
[00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.769]  We've changed the world.
[00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:34.090]  We launched the global explosive awakening to the globalists and their evil plan to set up world government, cut off the resources, bring in social engineering, poison, dumb down, and depopulate at least 80%.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:43.500]  That's now household knowledge, common knowledge, this family of guests and crew and listeners and activists and journalists and filmmakers.
[00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:48.240]  We have devastated the globalists.
[00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:53.919]  We have already done a lifetime's work and we are recognized by the good and the bad people in the world.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:12.720]  By the intelligence agencies, by the think tanks, by the PR firms, by the Democratic Party, by MI6 in the news as being the detonator, being the genesis point of the world we're in today with humanity in a fighting stance,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.660]  fighting for its life, turning the tide with the initiative and beginning to win.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:27.539]  So this family that has been this experience Has already won incredible victories in hearts and minds and have turned the tide.
[00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.039]  We haven't won the final war yet, but we're getting close.
[00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:38.019]  That said, this building and this equipment is not Infowars.
[00:17:38.259 --> 00:17:41.380]  The website, Infowars.com, is not the Infowar.
[00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:44.039]  I am the Infowar.
[00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:52.339]  Our audience of activists and men and women who are in the arena, who know this is not a spectator sport, are Infowars.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.640]  Infowars is an idea.
[00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.579]  Infowars is a family.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.880]  Infowars is stronger than ever.
[00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:01.440]  And the Streisand effect applies in spades.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:09.839]  Their desperate, ongoing, futile attempts to silence us have completely failed and done the opposite.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:21.259]  The Streisand effect is in operation here at the greatest level ever seen in modern history except Donald Trump.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.559]  We are penultimate to Trump.
[00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:35.700]  Meaning, number two, Trump is paramount in the story of Infowars and the Streisand effect is penultimate.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.119]  Or number two, the deuce.
[00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.490]  So, Elon is roaring forward.
[00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.849]  He loves the battle.
[00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:46.789]  He loves battling tyranny.
[00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:48.750]  He's got the gleam in his eye.
[00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.269]  He's hitting on all cylinders.
[00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:59.990]  And I love the fact that the globalists thought demonizing me, trying to silence me so they could build a straw man, demon Alex Jones, to try to discredit the populist movement.
[00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.460]  Against the New World Order, that totally failed.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.319]  Now Elon is reaching hundreds of millions, if not billions a day.
[00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:15.119]  Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, they're all, quote, radicalized by the globalist tyranny and the mask being off.
[00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:18.599]  So the globalists thought they could try to silence me.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.799]  And that then...
[00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:30.359]  That would somehow intimidate everybody else to crawl on their shells and stick their heads in the sand.
[00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:32.440]  You failed miserably.
[00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.599]  And people don't need to believe me.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.839]  You can see everything I'm saying.
[00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.740]  Words cannot describe how devastating the victories are against the globalists.
[00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:46.180]  That's why I laughed after they'd already found me guilty in the show trials.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:20:03.819]  When they have it on national TV, multi-billion dollar judgments, they ask for 2.76 trillion, the GDP of India, to have some giant Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain, scary voice telling you all to roll over and cower.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.299]  And instead, it only pissed you off, it only made you promote our articles and our videos and our reports more.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:28.900]  Until now, If you put all platforms together conservatively, 100 million people a day right now watch the show or watch the clips that I'm able to monitor.
[00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:33.180]  God knows what else is going on out there.
[00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:39.839]  So your support, your prayer, your word of mouth has done all of this.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.619]  And the auction closed at 1030 Central 50 minutes ago.
[00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:59.789]  And the group I'm working with that went in and put in the bid, which they admitted in a leak, which shouldn't have been done, to CNN was the biggest.
[00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.849]  And there's reasons behind that, obviously, them leaking that.
[00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.569]  I'll explain in a moment.
[00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.490]  You can figure it out yourself.
[00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:13.970]  And even if they rig this and the good guys don't get it, well, we're going to fight that in court.
[00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:32.460]  And even if the judge says, no, I'm going to let somebody in a closed secret bid when it was supposed to be a public auction online with one of the biggest companies out there where everybody could bid, that's what an auction is,
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.519]  and if it goes up, somebody else gets a chance, you have that feeding frenzy.
[00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:48.099]  No, we're told, oh, October, November 8th is the last day You can put your bids in, but then we learn Monday afternoon, oh no!
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.019]  We're not doing a public auction now.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.759]  You have until this morning at 10 a.m.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.500]  Central to put in your bid.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.400]  It'll be sealed.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.819]  At 10.30 it'll be opened.
[00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:08.299]  And then whoever's the highest will win, but no one gets to see who the other bids were to even see that indeed they were lower.
[00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:17.519]  And then there's a new little proviso in the contract Saying, but the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department can actually sell it to someone for less.
[00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:20.720]  But then we don't even get to know that.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.480]  Well, I think the judge will be interested in that if this goes to legal blows.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.480]  So that's some pretty big news right there.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.119]  I'm not saying the fix is in.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.500]  This is very unorthodox, very strange, last minute.
[00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:41.650]  And so the folks I'm working with talked to the auctioneer company that is respected, just a third party, just a broker.
[00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:46.029]  And they have been very close-lipped to the folks I'm working with.
[00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:48.430]  And they just said, yeah, the final bids are in.
[00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.210]  They'll be open at 1030.
[00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.349]  It'll be up to the U.S. trustee what he does.
[00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.190]  Chris Murray is his name from Houston.
[00:22:57.589 --> 00:23:01.190]  And you'll learn sometime today, but at the latest tomorrow morning.
[00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:10.789]  And so I'm just waiting to get a phone call and hear whether the good guys got it or whether the bad guys got it.
[00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:23.849]  And then they get a website and I guess if they buy that to the equipment, there's already another studio set up, whole nine yards, all that.
[00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.349]  And then they just say to the world they have a victory and then, oh, they got Infowars.com?
[00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.869]  I mean, Infowars.com has been important.
[00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.789]  It's been a big site, but that's just a jump point.
[00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:39.430]  That's just a launch pad.
[00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:43.049]  I mean, if I want to do 100 interviews a day, I can do them.
[00:23:43.369 --> 00:23:44.470]  Everybody wants me on.
[00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.349]  That's for years.
[00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.190]  I can reach a bigger audience anytime I want.
[00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.710]  I can do shows from anywhere.
[00:23:53.719 --> 00:24:01.940]  But again, the left just wants the symbol that they had some victory, which is not a victory at all, and just puts us in a giant Streisand effect.
[00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:03.599]  But I'm not a quitter.
[00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:09.079]  So I put all the money I'd saved into saving us, keeping us on air the last four or five years.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.539]  I didn't have a huge war chest, but I had some money there.
[00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:17.099]  And I'm loyal to the crew.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.059]  They've done a great job.
[00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:32.579]  And because the enemy sees shutting down this building and shutting down this particular show and getting the website Infowars.com, And the shopping cart, m4store.com, because they see that as a big victory, like a Roman standard they want to get.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.859]  I have been fighting them as hard as I can.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.539]  Because obviously they'll attack whatever else is set up after that.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.859]  Though I'm not the owner and not a principal and not part of it.
[00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:45.000]  Just work there.
[00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:47.799]  And the law says they can't stop me.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.660]  But since when has the law gotten in the way of what these people do?
[00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:54.549]  So I understand this is a fight.
[00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.269]  I'm effective.
[00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.049]  I'm telling the truth.
[00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:56.769]  We're massive.
[00:24:57.109 --> 00:25:01.930]  They tried to silence me, create a straw man that I'm the Sandy Hook man when I barely ever even talked about it.
[00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.130]  Covered the internet thinking it didn't happen.
[00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:11.450]  Then they raised money off me, claiming I was attacking them, running PR ads and fundraisers everywhere for years.
[00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:20.650]  Then they sued me after they'd used my name to put it all over the news and bring the story back in years after nobody talked about it.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:29.680]  To turn me into Adam Lanza and then have judges find me guilty and have show trials and create multi-billion dollar judgments.
[00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:40.640]  And what we were witnessing, as I said, in Texas and Connecticut on the courthouse steps was this is the media and the Democratic Party and the legal system on trial.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:50.819]  They think because they come to a rigged jurisdiction with controlled judges where I've already been found guilty with a script with HBO literally doing a production, that arrogant.
[00:25:52.970 --> 00:26:05.450]  That they think that they have fooled the world, and that's why in both fake trials, they had it on YouTube and other places, and then they took the comments off, because 99% of the comments saw through it and said, this is rigged.
[00:26:06.569 --> 00:26:07.049]  So...
[00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:11.329]  We're going to take the country back.
[00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.569]  We're going to take the world back.
[00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.950]  And you know the films are being made by a lot of different major groups.
[00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:23.849]  And what they're saying is this will just be like the Mendez documentary, where you think somebody's the worst person ever, and what they are is victims and heroes.
[00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:28.049]  And it is just going to come out completely that everything you were told was a lie.
[00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:34.230]  The CIA, the FBI ran it, the PR firms, the think tanks, the corrupt federal prosecutors that quarterbacked it.
[00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.269]  They call me corrupt.
[00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.289]  They are all going to be exposed.
[00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:55.049]  Now Steve Bannon in a rigged trial that he's a bad guy and that he raised money to bring attention to the border and try to get it controlled and you see we got Trump in and now that's happening.
[00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.589]  And it happened in his first administration.
[00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:03.930]  They're calling that fraud in a rigged New York system trying to put him in prison again right now.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.460]  But he's strong.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.599]  He understands it's the end of the globalists.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.259]  It's the end of their operation.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.839]  This is just the vestigial hangover that's left of the moves they were making on us.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.500]  And now Trump is draining the swamp.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.240]  Trump is going on the warpath.
[00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:19.980]  Trump is putting in the loyalists.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.180]  Trump is going to secure the border.
[00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:25.359]  Trump is going to cut energy prices.
[00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:26.839]  Trump is going to bring the jobs back.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.660]  Trump is going to prosecute the fentanyl dealers and execute them.
[00:27:31.099 --> 00:27:33.400]  Trump is going to find the missing kidnapped kids.
[00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:39.000]  Trump is going to stop World War III. So we have the momentum.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.019]  We have the initiative.
[00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:41.019]  We have the strength.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.240]  The corporate media is destroyed.
[00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:48.039]  It recognizes that it doesn't just not have power.
[00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:54.720]  When they attack us and lie about us, they're so reviled and hated, it makes us even stronger.
[00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:58.759]  It's not that they have a 5% effect on us anymore.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.880]  They have a negative effect on themselves.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:06.180]  They just dig their hole deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.059]  So, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.519]  The auction's over.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.559]  You don't get to see it online now.
[00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:18.140]  It's all behind a cape, like the Wizard of Oz, in his control room.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.980]  And I have no idea what is about to be pulled.
[00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:26.230]  It's very rare.
[00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.710]  It's unheard of what's going on.
[00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:30.990]  It is bizarre.
[00:28:31.569 --> 00:28:42.329]  But I told everybody, I said, you think, because we got people ready to come in here and basically pay, I mean, if I told you, a lot of money to save InfoWars.
[00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:50.029]  And I tried to explain to people, I said, listen, we'd just be better setting up a new infrastructure and putting that money into...
[00:28:51.069 --> 00:28:54.250]  More crew, more satellites, more reporters, more hosts.
[00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.390]  But the point is, is that people decided that they want to save InfoWars.
[00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:10.089]  And I said, well, I predict on the current trajectory, no matter how much money you bring forward, that they're going to just say, sorry, you don't get it.
[00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.170]  Because that's what they do.
[00:29:12.309 --> 00:29:13.410]  That's why they're discredited.
[00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.130]  And we're about to see if that's right.
[00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:16.789]  But...
[00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.109]  I didn't beat you, globalists.
[00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:21.349]  God beat you.
[00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:23.230]  You understand that?
[00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.509]  And you're on the way out, and everything you do is turning to crap?
[00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:33.210]  So how's it feel to be a bunch of losers that tried to bully the American people and messed around and found out?
[00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.250]  You got that?
[00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:34.769]  Good.
[00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:40.170]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.730]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.549]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.430]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.750]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[00:29:50.869 --> 00:29:51.829]  Don't tell me you're eating right.
[00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.690]  I'm not going to buy that shit.
[00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.190]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.029]  Oh, no.
[00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.890]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:07.009]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.930]  That's why, right here.
[00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:13.769]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.569]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:17.490]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:25.269]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the CMOS. And I am doing a plug here.
[00:30:25.349 --> 00:30:27.710]  Because, you know, we could be shut down next to...
[00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.910]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[00:30:31.069 --> 00:30:34.269]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:43.329]  For TV viewers, you can see our triumphant 47 battle-hardened after nine years of intense political warfare against the deep state.
[00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.210]  He never gave up.
[00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.130]  We didn't give up.
[00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.910]  People spent massive amounts of money, time, and energy.
[00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:54.339]  Ensuring that they could not openly steal this election.
[00:30:54.339 --> 00:30:57.119]  They tried, it mitigated the win, but we still got the trifecta.
[00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:01.279]  Control of the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary.
[00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:06.319]  And now the system is in absolute, total panic mode.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:14.059]  The puppet for Obama, who served via fraud, the third administration of Obama.
[00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:20.730]  Joseph Biden, Congratulated Trump today.
[00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.230]  We'll play that video and audio of that in a moment at the White House.
[00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.089]  I've tried to search and have not found any evidence.
[00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:41.109]  Two months ago, Biden said that he would provide Air Force aircraft to follow Trump Force One while he was campaigning due to missile threats.
[00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:45.730]  They were trying to claim Iran was making, but Iran has said it's not them, it's the deep state.
[00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:46.690]  Obviously it is.
[00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:58.819]  We're good to go.
[00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:20.430]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.329 --> 00:32:38.809]  Right before the election, Trump still did not have those aircraft that Biden promised.
[00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:45.730]  You can just type in, Biden promises to give Trump whatever he wants, including anti-missile aircraft.
[00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:47.549]  Didn't do it.
[00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:55.009]  So is Trump flying around as president-elect without Air Force protection?
[00:32:58.359 --> 00:33:04.039]  That's why when Vladimir Putin flies anywhere, you see their fighter jets flying beside them.
[00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:11.119]  That's why when the president flies anywhere, you see fighter jets and other aircraft that have anti-missile systems on them.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.480]  That's why they shadow the aircraft.
[00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:19.380]  Well, I found footage of him coming into D.C. today.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.319]  I didn't see those aircraft.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.039]  Maybe they're there, but this is a full...
[00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:27.039]  Alarm.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:28.859]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:33.559]  Biden approves Trump's request for military aircraft vehicles amid Iran assassination threat.
[00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:36.380]  I said two months ago, let's scroll down and see if I nailed the time.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.900]  Yeah, just go ahead and scroll up on the article a little bit to the date.
[00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:45.880]  It'll be right there on the header by the author's name.
[00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:50.839]  And that was October 11th.
[00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:53.700]  Well, he actually made the approval before that.
[00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:54.500]  It was about two months ago.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.880]  But last time I checked, still not there.
[00:33:59.019 --> 00:33:59.900]  Now, hopefully it is.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.319]  But somebody needs to find out right now.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.500]  Because if you think the deep state won't blow his aircraft out of the sky, you're a fool.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.699]  So, yeah, we're winning.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.900]  We're draining the swamp.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.320]  That makes them more dangerous than ever.
[00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:20.480]  So, back to...
[00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:34.269]  The auction being closed, and I'm waiting any minute here to get the word if the good guys or the bad guys got it.
[00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:44.829]  And so it's a little stressful, but no word has come in yet.
[00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.469]  But I will continue on with the broadcast.
[00:34:49.679 --> 00:35:14.800]  And if I hear in an hour or three hours that bad guys got it and their request has already been made that we be shut down immediately when they win the bid but the judge said it has to be certified by him in court and that date's not been set well I'm not intending like they tried in late May to just have private security show up here and say get out of the building I'm going to say where's the judge's order?
[00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:22.489]  Because if We're concerned already about what's going on with this auction and how it's being done.
[00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:28.070]  We have the right to exercise that and have a court hearing about what went on.
[00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:37.550]  So just because somebody tells me the fight's over, you can go home, that's a classic trick of warfare, isn't it?
[00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:54.699]  So I demand, if the bad guys get it, The judges' certification, just because they say they bought it, just because they say they won the bid, the judges said he has to finalize the sale.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:06.260]  And the good guys I'm working with were told, in writing, that it will take a month to certify their purchase and to have the transfer from the federal trustee in the court to the buyer.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.699]  But we're told if the bad guys buy it, they get it instantly.
[00:36:10.699 --> 00:36:12.280]  That's why Americans are mad.
[00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:14.619]  That's why Americans are pissed off.
[00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:18.619]  Because we're tired of one rule for the American people.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.739]  And for Christians and conservatives and populists and capitalists and libertarians.
[00:36:24.139 --> 00:36:25.940]  And another rule for the left.
[00:36:28.679 --> 00:36:32.960]  So, yeah, they're calling it the last day of Infowars here.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.460]  And again, I can go over to the other studio.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.539]  I can continue on.
[00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:41.519]  Quite frankly, all these attacks and publicity will just make it bigger no matter what happens.
[00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:49.019]  But I don't give up ground that hasn't been taken and hasn't been certified by a judge.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.619]  You know, a judge.
[00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:54.840]  Hell, at least we get a judge, right?
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:01.820]  In my show trials, the judges found me guilty for the first time in U.S. history in a major trial and told the jury I was guilty.
[00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:04.280]  The judge instructed him, this man is guilty.
[00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:07.980]  At the start of the trials and the end, you will decide how guilty.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:16.519]  He made hundreds of millions of dollars off these people with no proof, made zero money off these people, barely ever talked about them.
[00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.750]  This man terrorized and attacked them.
[00:37:19.969 --> 00:37:21.429]  No proof, no evidence ever given.
[00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.809]  This man is Satan.
[00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.150]  This man is a billionaire.
[00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:30.730]  This man can sprout wings and fly to the moon.
[00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.329]  All horse crap.
[00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:39.010]  At the time of the first trial in Texas, I had $3.1 million in the bank.
[00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.849]  No other hidden money, nothing.
[00:37:41.989 --> 00:37:44.429]  And my legal bills were already above that.
[00:37:45.369 --> 00:37:55.369]  And by the end of that first trial, I paid the lawyers for the last six months, year of intense work and all the attacks, and I was negative.
[00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:04.309]  But they got up on the stand with a financial expert that never saw my books.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.139]  Literally dressed up like Thurston Howell III. Oh, Buffy.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.380]  Deary.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.500]  So this man is worth billions.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.440]  He made all his money off these people.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.079]  Attacking them.
[00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:20.360]  Squeezing them.
[00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:21.420]  Demonizing them.
[00:38:21.539 --> 00:38:22.900]  Peeing on their graves.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.639]  Sending people to attack them.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.760]  He's like Attila the Hun when it comes to finances.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.380]  Probably one of the richest men in the world.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.920]  I mean, just ridiculous.
[00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:39.650]  And we want 2.76 trillion.
[00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.150]  That might not even approach it.
[00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:45.949]  He has more money than anyone on earth.
[00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.730]  More money than anyone combined.
[00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.150]  He has universes of cash, all made of these people.
[00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.769]  All made by peeing on the graves.
[00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.949]  Of dead children.
[00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.849]  You're just like, what the hell?
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.469]  What type of lunatic land am I in?
[00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.489]  But these are the same people that tell you two men can have a baby.
[00:39:05.639 --> 00:39:10.239]  They teach X and Y chromosomes don't exist in schools all over the Western world because BlackRock says so.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.219]  That's part of the ESG scores for them to get loans and grants.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.019]  You say there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:31.809]  And then later they say, well, he's been audited by three outside accounting firms by the federal court and they went back 10 years and Turns out Alex Jones had meager assets.
[00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.590]  That's why I laughed at the end of the second show trial.
[00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.650]  I was already back in Austin.
[00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.710]  It was totally show trial.
[00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:40.210]  I just left.
[00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.769]  And I'm back here when they had the $1.5 million verdict that said, that's not enough, Your Honor.
[00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:47.349]  We want $2.76 trillion.
[00:39:47.809 --> 00:39:49.210]  If you're a new listener, I'm not joking.
[00:39:49.329 --> 00:39:51.190]  I'm in Alex Jones, $2.76 trillion.
[00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:53.969]  We get Bloomberg, AP Reuters.
[00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:05.489]  And They're all cheering, and the jury, I'm already found guilty, but they decide how guilty.
[00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:17.730]  And I just laughed at it, because I'm like, by the time of that second rig trial, because they had one in October, so the first show trial was going on this time, two years ago.
[00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:26.750]  And by then, I was like, five million in the hole, because I had to pay all the bills as well.
[00:40:26.909 --> 00:40:28.570]  They made me pay for the audits.
[00:40:30.779 --> 00:40:32.300]  Against myself, the court.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.659]  The judge didn't do me any favors.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.519]  He just believed him up front that I was a master criminal.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.679]  I had $360 million in a secret bank account.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.219]  No proof.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.320]  I'm just sitting there in the court going, what the hell is this?
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.679]  They put filings in.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.139]  The Justice Department literally told me depositions.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.460]  Here's the U.S. code.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]  We catch you in one lie.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.199]  You're going to prison.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:49.800]  You understand that?
[00:40:50.369 --> 00:40:51.769]  And I'm just like, I have accountants.
[00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:52.730]  I have mainline firms.
[00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:54.329]  I don't even touch, I don't balance my checkbook.
[00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:55.909]  You know everything I've ever done.
[00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:01.989]  Every grocery bill, every airline ticket, every hotel, everything I've got.
[00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:14.889]  Then they turned to my parents and said, they've got billions hidden and sued the hell out of them for two years.
[00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:23.900]  And Now my dad's trying to take out a loan to not lose his house he's lived in 35 years.
[00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:26.139]  And hey, you think that hurts me?
[00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:27.179]  You think it hurts my parents?
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.780]  You think it makes us get scared of you?
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.840]  You think it makes us want to battle you?
[00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:33.920]  Man, I guess you're not from Texas, are you?
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.340]  Yeah, right.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.480]  You make me get out of bed at morning and fight harder.
[00:41:43.719 --> 00:41:54.380]  You make me stay up here at 10 o'clock at night and do, you know, 10 different reports a day on top of the show that reach, I mean, on average, 50, 60 million people a day just with those.
[00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:55.880]  That's just for you.
[00:41:58.139 --> 00:42:06.380]  You think a couple whacks to my good old boy Guts gonna get me down to quote that great remake of Cape Fear?
[00:42:09.319 --> 00:42:10.139]  Counselor!
[00:42:10.139 --> 00:42:10.960]  Counselor!
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.500]  Come out, come out, wherever you are!
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.880]  I can outthink you, I can outlearn you, and I'm gonna outlast you!
[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:42.150]  And I'm going to inspire people across the world to not have our will broken, to not be demoralized, to love God and love our families and love our country and love justice.
[00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:49.769]  And the straw man you tried to build about me, the fraud you tried to build and silence me so you could tell the world that I was that monster?
[00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.269]  Well, guess what?
[00:42:52.349 --> 00:43:02.250]  You failed from keeping the people from me and they know exactly who I am and they know my track record and they know what we stand for and they know we're bringing the victory.
[00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:11.869]  And just as the Bible tells us, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:21.590]  Because we are not given to a spirit of weakness and fear, but the spirit of an overcomer and a victor and a lion.
[00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:32.969]  So I want to thank my enemies, and I don't mean this as a joke, for their persecution and for their lies.
[00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.909]  Because I wouldn't have fought so hard.
[00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:38.309]  I wouldn't have been so strong.
[00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:39.829]  I might have taken it easy.
[00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:41.389]  I might have rested on my laurels.
[00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:56.269]  If I wasn't attacked with such vicious evil and fraud and lies and scams and PR firms and the corporate media, but while you were attacking me, you were showing the world who you really are, so all I did was draw you out.
[00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:08.389]  And our hardcore viewers and listeners, they stood with us Through the thick and thin, and we turn the tide.
[00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.010]  And now we're dominating everywhere.
[00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:12.809]  You have lost.
[00:44:12.949 --> 00:44:14.110]  You are a failure.
[00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:15.630]  You are the bad people.
[00:44:15.809 --> 00:44:17.309]  You are the globalists.
[00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:21.610]  You are connected to the New World Order and all of its crimes and what it's done.
[00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:25.750]  You support this rotting, collapsing, globalist edifice.
[00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:29.690]  And your whole facade has fallen.
[00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:37.329]  And I am just so incredibly blessed and honored to be here, victorious!
[00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:43.269]  But I don't play Machiavellian games.
[00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:46.050]  I have 100% fought for InfoWars.
[00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:47.389]  I put in everything I've got.
[00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.289]  I have fully committed to this crew.
[00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:50.210]  I love them.
[00:44:55.329 --> 00:44:57.690]  But I can sure look at dialectics.
[00:45:02.139 --> 00:45:11.119]  Which is philosopher Hegel's model of the dynamics in society, culture, ideas, which he didn't invent.
[00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:13.400]  He just quantified in a system that's very accurate.
[00:45:14.199 --> 00:45:15.840]  He just observed reality.
[00:45:16.039 --> 00:45:25.900]  And if you knew how to think in a Hegelian way, you would know you were beaten before you ever started.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.539]  But see, you don't think...
[00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:32.300]  Even in the third dimension.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.920]  So I can't expect you to be able to think in the fourth, fifth, or sixth.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]  So good luck.
[00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:43.119]  Can you think 50 moves ahead?
[00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:46.079]  Can you think 100 moves ahead?
[00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:48.360]  You can't, can't you?
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.900]  And that's your disability being evil.
[00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:57.619]  Because that's what evil is, is being short-sighted and being attracted to shortcuts.
[00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.530]  And attracted to one-dimensional moves that look like victory.
[00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:08.050]  Did them wiping everybody out at the Alamo was not a victory for Santa Ana or a defeat.
[00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:15.750]  Travis wrote and knew that they were going to probably be wiped out and killed.
[00:46:16.269 --> 00:46:19.590]  But he was so into the energy of being a victor.
[00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.510]  He was so into the energy of sacrificing himself on the tree of liberty.
[00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:35.730]  And we don't have to sacrifice as much as Colonel Travis now, do we?
[00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:49.050]  You see, Travis didn't need to read the writings of Hegel because he's a man of the real world.
[00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:51.389]  Real street smart.
[00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:57.369]  And he knew that he was part of something bigger.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:10.099]  And so you cockroaches of the left don't understand what real power is all about.
[00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:15.340]  Because real power comes from truth.
[00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:18.340]  Real power comes from sacrifice.
[00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:20.760]  Real power comes from will.
[00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:23.800]  And you just don't have power.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.440]  That's why you always try to pull down the strong and the beautiful and the eloquent and the true.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:41.320]  Because the mere existence of people that actually stand in the light of God is an affront to you in your disgusting spiritual ugliness.
[00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:47.119]  And I feel sorry that you're so spiritually ugly and poor and pathetic.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.880]  I look at you and just feel so sorry for you.
[00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:58.389]  And then I look away because I can spiritually smell your rot.
[00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:01.269]  The death that hangs about you.
[00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.309]  The spiritual decay.
[00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:18.389]  So, when I tell you that everything you've seen has been part of God's plan, you don't need me to tell you that.
[00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:22.550]  You know that in your heart of hearts.
[00:48:25.699 --> 00:48:27.519]  So don't ever let these people break your will.
[00:48:27.679 --> 00:48:29.159]  Don't ever let them demoralize you.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:34.940]  Don't ever let them convince you that you're scum because you love God and love freedom and love justice and love truth.
[00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:38.920]  Because they can never break your will.
[00:48:40.059 --> 00:48:45.739]  You have to decide that they broke your will and you have to break your will yourself.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:49:03.820]  Your will, when aligned with God, Is 100% unbendable, unassailable, indomitable, invincible.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:11.940]  And it's that spirit that these devil-worshipping scum hate.
[00:49:18.269 --> 00:49:25.750]  Let me finish up on this, and I'm going to move on from Alex Jones and what could be our last broadcast from these historic walls.
[00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:31.949]  And again, all of this is a teaching moment for myself and everyone else.
[00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.210]  But if I mention something, I always like to show it to you, unlike the corporate media.
[00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.710]  But look at some of these headlines.
[00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:54.610]  CNN, InfoWars attract seven-figure auction bids that will decide fate of Alex Jones' empire.
[00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.349]  Lie upon lie.
[00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.969]  This isn't an empire.
[00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:07.670]  These are just satellite uplinks and internet uplinks and places show clips and interview guests.
[00:50:07.889 --> 00:50:11.849]  So the empire is not this equipment or this desk or this microphone.
[00:50:13.199 --> 00:50:21.000]  The Empire is the awake people out there that know what's happening in the world and are accelerating their information war against the New World Order.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.260]  So let's get that straight.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.840]  But they want the idea to see, oh, the Empire is gone.
[00:50:28.019 --> 00:50:29.159]  Alex Jones is defeated.
[00:50:30.699 --> 00:50:35.659]  Colonel Travis is defeated in 1836 by Santa Ana.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.199]  You didn't know the Texas loss?
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.820]  You didn't know Texas never existed?
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.440]  No.
[00:50:41.679 --> 00:50:43.380]  Well, you know Colonel Travis got killed.
[00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:44.079]  I mean, they lost.
[00:50:44.199 --> 00:50:44.860]  Texas lost.
[00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:46.239]  See what a lie?
[00:50:46.659 --> 00:50:49.260]  These are people of a lie.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:55.360]  Every line in here is an attack on the truth.
[00:50:56.019 --> 00:51:00.880]  And then they mix their scams in to try to legitimize it.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.900]  And they go on to say, well, the biggest bidder is an Alex Jones supporter.
[00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.570]  Under the rules, we don't know who the other bettors are.
[00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:13.929]  We don't know what they were.
[00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.510]  How do they know this?
[00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:22.070]  Because the one bettor we did know was our people, and they've got the number in here.
[00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.530]  See, they listen to your phones, they read your email.
[00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.710]  This is the CIA. That's what CNN is.
[00:51:30.469 --> 00:51:36.710]  But despite surveilling us and having all the money and the Justice Department and everything else, they're getting their ass kicked.
[00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.010]  Because we all know you're the crooks.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.659]  We all know you're the bad guys.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.340]  You're the liars.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.019]  You're the frauds.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.059]  You can go read the article.
[00:51:44.219 --> 00:51:47.260]  They know what we bid, our people bid.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.340]  So that can encourage somebody else to bid above it.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.960]  See how that works.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.280]  And it goes on.
[00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:04.619]  Infowars Austin can determine whether Alex Jones has kicked off its platforms.
[00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.929]  What?
[00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.090]  Infowars.com?
[00:52:07.909 --> 00:52:08.869]  Cry me a river.
[00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.429]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones Media Empire, up for sale.
[00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.250]  No, I am the empire.
[00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:17.110]  My listeners are the empire.
[00:52:17.289 --> 00:52:18.570]  My crew is the empire.
[00:52:18.849 --> 00:52:19.909]  My host is the empire.
[00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:24.170]  All the major stories we broke and our super accuracy rate is the empire.
[00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:28.590]  That's why they say I'm a liar and not accurate because everybody knows I'm one of the most accurate people in the world.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.619]  All lies.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.500]  Alex Jones' InfoWars will be auctioned today.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.239]  One bid is in seventh figure range.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:38.940]  The Statesman.
[00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:40.440]  Oh.
[00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:44.219]  And it goes on and on.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.159]  And I think it discredits me in these articles.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.780]  Oh, Jones says the courts were rigged.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.880]  He was found guilty by the judges.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.960]  And this is like the Soviet Union.
[00:52:56.219 --> 00:52:58.619]  That's one real reason Trump won in a landslide.
[00:52:58.679 --> 00:52:59.719]  Everybody's sick of the lawfare.
[00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:03.519]  But notice they act like, oh, he's crazy.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.380]  He says the courts are corrupt.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.880]  He says water's wet.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.440]  Not all the courts, but a lot of them are.
[00:53:11.619 --> 00:53:12.440]  We know that.
[00:53:13.219 --> 00:53:14.159]  So I'm going to go to break.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:22.400]  We've got a great talk show host joining us to talk about the Trump victory, what he thinks is coming up next, and having the world play a lot of clips as well, break a lot of the news, get to the clips.
[00:53:24.039 --> 00:53:25.780]  Salty Cracker is joining us.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.860]  We can get the word on who bought InfoWars any minute.
[00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:35.650]  Sounds like they already know, but, you know, we're just the real people, so we don't get to know anything.
[00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.989]  We follow the rules of the auction.
[00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.670]  Nobody will tell us anything, but CNN gets to know all the secrets.
[00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:42.090]  You know, that's just how it always is.
[00:53:42.429 --> 00:53:44.349]  Just like the insider trading by the members of Congress.
[00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.989]  You don't get that info, but they do.
[00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:47.369]  They made a special rule for themselves.
[00:53:48.429 --> 00:53:50.650]  Judge Joe Brown's coming up and more today.
[00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.730]  Probably General Flynn.
[00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.170]  Had MTG on yesterday so much more.
[00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.130]  But, yeah.
[00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:01.889]  This is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:54:02.449 --> 00:54:10.449]  If you do want to support the new operation, the Alex Jones Network, through our sponsors, get some great supplements at the same time that are amazing.
[00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:18.590]  I mean, Ultimate CMOS, the superfood, great Trump gear, collector's item posters that are fundraisers, classic Infowars shirt.
[00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:21.349]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.010]  If you're a VIP, $30 a month cancelling time.
[00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.670]  You get $40 to spend on the store each month.
[00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:27.650]  You make money with that.
[00:54:27.769 --> 00:54:29.650]  So if you're going to support us, you've got to be a VIP member.
[00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:31.670]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:32.530]  Please take action.
[00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.469]  History is happening now, plus these products are amazing.
[00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:39.389]  Hundreds of shirts and caps and hoodies and just great supplements and everything.
[00:54:39.469 --> 00:54:40.389]  It's an amazing site.
[00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.650]  Check it out, thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:48.050]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the big moment of truth is here.
[00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:52.789]  I'm taping this as an emergency message on Friday, November 8th in the evening.
[00:54:54.050 --> 00:55:06.750]  And in just a few days, next Wednesday, November 13th, by order of a federal judge, InfoWars is being sold to auction and the bad guys say they're going to buy it to turn it off and try to take me off air.
[00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:12.570]  Well, even if they shut down this building and take the website InfoWars away, I'm the Infowar.
[00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:13.489]  You're the Infowar.
[00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.630]  The crew is the Infowar.
[00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.449]  Our work is the Infowar.
[00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:19.809]  The globalist plan was deliberately trying to make us poor.
[00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:20.969]  They admit that, the Great Reset.
[00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.969]  That's why just a few days after he's president-elect, Bitcoin's way up.
[00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.909]  The stock market's way up.
[00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:31.369]  All these companies are announcing they're moving back to the US. Russia says they're not going to try to dethrone the dollar anymore.
[00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.949]  So now, it's more important than ever that we stay on air.
[00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:42.989]  And the only way we can stay on air In the face of all this tyranny, is if you support us.
[00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:54.550]  So when you go to thealexjonesstore.com, incredible supplements, great Patriot apparel, amazing collectible knives, it's all there.
[00:55:55.090 --> 00:56:10.010]  But we've come out with three fundraiser items that are limited edition, that do have markup in them, so that instead of selling a t-shirt, and we end up making like 10 bucks on it, And it doesn't, at the end of the day, bring in enough funds.
[00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:16.969]  Just like NPR will have a fundraiser to promote their communism and globalism, and a coffee cup probably costs them six, seven bucks.
[00:56:17.949 --> 00:56:21.130]  When they sell it for a hundred, you know it's not worth that.
[00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:22.110]  It's a fundraiser.
[00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:26.030]  You're getting the memento that you supported their New World Order agenda.
[00:56:26.869 --> 00:56:28.150]  Well, you don't want to do that.
[00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:30.190]  You want to support what we're doing.
[00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:34.610]  So we have these three great limited edition posters.
[00:56:36.289 --> 00:56:46.070]  Two of them are about InfoWars and celebrating its history and what we've done, whether it survives or not, and just remembering all we've gone through together and ensuring that we continue to fight on the future.
[00:56:46.489 --> 00:56:53.670]  And the other is an Alex Jones-style InfoWars crew, kind of Star Wars spoof spinoff.
[00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:57.250]  And they're all great to hang in your office, great to hang in your house.
[00:56:58.599 --> 00:56:59.539]  They're limited edition.
[00:56:59.719 --> 00:57:00.820]  They're pieces of history.
[00:57:01.159 --> 00:57:06.920]  And so when you get them for $50, it costs us to print it and put it in the tube and all that like seven or eight bucks.
[00:57:07.139 --> 00:57:10.480]  We get some real funds in for operations.
[00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:13.059]  So I can tell you there's only a few thousand of each one of these posters.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:20.639]  If you get them, I will have the funds to operate for a few months.
[00:57:21.639 --> 00:57:26.619]  As it stands right now, we've only got the funds to really get about a month or so launched.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.000]  So I need your help.
[00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:31.980]  Our work is the most important it's ever been right now.
[00:57:32.119 --> 00:57:33.000]  These are great posters.
[00:57:33.679 --> 00:57:35.940]  I'm asking the Infowars family to stand with us.
[00:57:36.039 --> 00:57:38.480]  You've done so much in the past at this most critical of times.
[00:57:38.639 --> 00:57:42.719]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get one or more of these posters.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.679]  And I humbly, respectfully thank you for your support.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.699]  But I gotta tell you, they are good-looking posters.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.159]  I mean, the Star Wars spinoff spoof is fun, but I designed the...
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.639]  InfoWars, red and white on black designs.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.559]  One says 1776 worldwide.
[00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:02.420]  2024, Alex Jones with my signature.
[00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:04.860]  The other says InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[00:58:05.159 --> 00:58:07.320]  These are really great looking posters.
[00:58:07.519 --> 00:58:10.579]  They're iconic and the tyrants hate InfoWars.
[00:58:10.679 --> 00:58:11.579]  They hate the idea of it.
[00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:13.429]  And it will live on regardless.
[00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:15.190]  So I thank those that have supported.
[00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:17.130]  I ask those that have supported to support again.
[00:58:17.269 --> 00:58:18.210]  And those that have been on the fence.
[00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:19.989]  Maybe you shared articles, videos, you're a fan.
[00:58:20.269 --> 00:58:21.150]  What are you doing?
[00:58:21.329 --> 00:58:22.650]  This is history happening.
[00:58:22.869 --> 00:58:24.150]  We're turning the tide.
[00:58:24.289 --> 00:58:25.050]  We have the initiative.
[00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.110]  We're starting to win.
[00:58:26.929 --> 00:58:28.670]  We've won major battles, but not the war.
[00:58:28.969 --> 00:58:35.949]  So go down to thealexjonesstore.com and get one of these historic posters and keep us on the air one way or another.
[00:58:36.389 --> 00:58:37.269]  I thank you.
[00:58:37.469 --> 00:58:39.010]  And now I ask you to take action.
[00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:39.710]  God bless.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.400]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58:49.619 --> 00:58:55.119]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.380]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:58:59.639 --> 00:59:03.199]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're going to come for us.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.539]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:59:06.739 --> 00:59:13.539]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:15.260]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.380]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:19.059]  Listen.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:24.980]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:59:31.489 --> 00:59:36.210]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:54.170]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.750]  That's what matters.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:07.940]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:10.599]  That is punishment.
[01:00:11.219 --> 01:00:12.860]  That is deterrence.
[01:00:16.039 --> 01:00:18.739]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:43.090]  Getting ready to bounce?
[01:00:45.769 --> 01:00:46.909]  Or will you stop it?
[01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:52.909]  That's going to be in your hands.
[01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:57.510]  And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back in your asses.
[01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:01.090]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:08.050]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.719]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:24.539]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.820]  I believe it.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:33.559]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[01:01:34.199 --> 01:01:37.420]  Yeah, there's gonna be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:43.539]  And that's also gonna have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:53.570]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards Is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:57.369]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.710]  Jones.
[01:01:57.929 --> 01:02:01.210]  Because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[01:02:03.739 --> 01:02:10.000]  Some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.860]  I can only imagine what federal receipt was going to do.
[01:02:13.679 --> 01:02:15.760]  So yeah, it's gonna get interesting from here on out.
[01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:17.760]  It's gonna get really interesting, that's for sure.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:24.639]  It's already super interesting, but like we say, it's the end of the beginning.
[01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:27.880]  And boy, are these clients happy about it.
[01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:31.199]  There was certainly a message sent out of this courthouse today, that's for sure.
[01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:36.300]  But we will be at it as long as it takes.
[01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:47.179]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.960]  And to go back to what Robbie Parker said, all Alex Jones does is take from you, exploit you, lie to you.
[01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:59.769]  Feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust.
[01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.389]  And the only person that benefits in that equation is him.
[01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:04.889]  Well, that stops.
[01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.429]  That's stopping today, thanks to the courage of these families.
[01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:09.869]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:10.909]  Thanks, Senator.
[01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:15.650]  Yeah, so you hear them telling you, don't support me, we're going to go away.
[01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:16.949]  They thought they could shut me up.
[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.090]  They thought they could shut you up.
[01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.289]  They lied about what I did.
[01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.170]  They had rigged trials.
[01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:21.030]  The judges found me guilty.
[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.650]  It didn't work.
[01:03:22.639 --> 01:03:31.400]  We're good to go.
[01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:40.219]  We're good to go.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.679]  And said, fight, fight, fight.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:55.960]  And that's the minute you could stick a fork in the New World Order and know that the fall of the globalists had gone into high gear and nothing could put it back together again.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.280]  Absolutely historic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:08.519]  Fight, fight, fight.
[01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.829]  That's what this is all about.
[01:04:14.409 --> 01:04:17.409]  America and the world was asleep before.
[01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.710]  And the globalists had a free hand.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.820]  But now they don't.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:29.420]  I really wanted to get this popular podcaster and talk show host known as Salty Cracker and his wife Miss Salty Cracker on today.
[01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:31.079]  Saltmustflow.com.
[01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:33.340]  It's certainly flowing the leftist tiers.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.059]  And there's so many angles, so much to cover.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.880]  What's the deep state going to pull?
[01:04:38.019 --> 01:04:39.940]  I see them in full route right now.
[01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:41.699]  Trump's making a lot of really great moves.
[01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:43.860]  The empire has struck back.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.139]  The Republicans in the Senate voted against what the people want.
[01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:55.070]  They've chosen John Toon as their leader, replacing McConnell instead of Rick Scott.
[01:04:55.289 --> 01:04:59.230]  So the swamp is not defeated, but we have the initiative.
[01:04:59.489 --> 01:05:01.150]  So much more coming up.
[01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.090]  The Democrat Party still trying to steal the Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.449]  That's being exposed.
[01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.369]  They have illegal alien votes openly being counted.
[01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:09.329]  Elon Musk and others are exposing it.
[01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:12.590]  Salty Cracker, great to have you here, my old friend.
[01:05:13.289 --> 01:05:15.230]  What's the 35,000-foot view?
[01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:16.590]  What's most important on your radar?
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:17.889]  Let's go through all the big developments.
[01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:21.769]  Well, thank you for having me.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.389]  You are certainly a lightning rod, Mr.
[01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.210]  Alex Jones.
[01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.670]  And what I just saw them do to Mr.
[01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:40.730]  Trump on that little video feed before we came in is essentially what they tried to do to you, and it didn't seem to work, even though they're trying to shut you down right now.
[01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:45.650]  And so, you know, it sucks to be here on this day where they're auctioning off your stuff.
[01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:48.889]  But the 30,000-foot view is...
[01:05:49.569 --> 01:05:55.909]  It's always darkest before dawn, I'm guessing, and it's feeling pretty much like dawn right now.
[01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:58.469]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:02.429]  I mean, they think grabbing a website and equipment does something.
[01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.829]  Like, we're supposed to go, oh, God, we're beat.
[01:06:03.889 --> 01:06:04.849]  We're going to go away now.
[01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:06.570]  No, this will triple the audience.
[01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.949]  I mean, again, their only move is to convince us that we've lost.
[01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:12.829]  It's a Jedi mind trick.
[01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:26.349]  Yeah, and that guy, that lawyer dude who was talking about, we got to shut Alex, probably doing a more lispy voice, but we got to shut him down, make sure that he can't ever do this again.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:41.739]  That right there is the emboldened power of a very weak man to try and take down somebody who's actually strong, actually built from the ground up, somebody who's actually got testosterone, somebody who's actually created something.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:48.039]  So the state and these powers work with these really weak pieces of crap.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.159]  And utilize the system to tear down anything that's obstructing them.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:07:01.300]  And that guy right there with his creepy little worm-like smile towards Dan where he's kind of cackling on the inside, but it's breaking through in his face.
[01:07:01.699 --> 01:07:03.119]  This is a good day for us.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:03.960]  Good day for us.
[01:07:04.059 --> 01:07:05.380]  You just try to...
[01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:14.619]  This notion that Alex Jones can never work again, nobody could ever hear this man ever again, should strike fear in normal people out there.
[01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:19.019]  You should hear how these people were talking when they thought that they were going to get away with all of this.
[01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:24.760]  They thought that they were going to be able to lawfare their opponents, lawfare anybody who was going to stop them, into oblivion.
[01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:31.719]  And I'm hoping that what we're seeing right now is the turning of this, and I hope retribution comes for these people.
[01:07:32.239 --> 01:07:38.960]  Not in a physical way, you scumbag lawyers and you criminals over there in the justice system.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.480]  But I hope this guy ends up in prison.
[01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:45.800]  I think it wouldn't be very hard to find that he's probably allegedly into some stuff they shouldn't be into.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.340]  Oh, then there's the famous clip where they say to me...
[01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:56.269]  You're claiming that the Clintons and others are involved in child trafficking?
[01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:00.349]  And I go, oh, you mean like Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons?
[01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:02.969]  I mean, they just walk right into this stuff.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.840]  Yeah, like the dude who we've got pictures of him on the plane with, and he's waving.
[01:08:09.159 --> 01:08:12.420]  Ghislaine Maxwell was at Hillary Clinton's daughter's wedding.
[01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:13.480]  She's in the back.
[01:08:13.579 --> 01:08:14.000]  You can see her.
[01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:15.440]  She's poking her head out.
[01:08:16.119 --> 01:08:21.279]  There's this notion that these people are pretending that child trafficking doesn't exist when it's clearly, I mean, we've arrested people.
[01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:26.319]  You got P. Diddy right now being arrested for allegedly trafficking children.
[01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.180]  You got all these billionaires trafficking children.
[01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.380]  Who are the billionaires trafficking children to?
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.640]  Who are these people?
[01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:36.260]  Well, then you've got the Mendez brothers turning out are totally innocent victims being raped since the time they were babies.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.939]  And of course, who's the dad?
[01:08:38.079 --> 01:08:40.479]  He's a record executive out in Hollywood.
[01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:41.720]  I mean, it's a cult.
[01:08:42.949 --> 01:08:47.550]  Yeah, they only let people in there who are compromised or willing to be compromised.
[01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:53.470]  And anybody who stands up against it, they send weak men like that in your direction.
[01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.569]  And he thinks that he's done anything.
[01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:56.529]  That dude's a puppet.
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:59.170]  That dude's a sock puppet being worked by the system over there.
[01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:02.590]  By the way, that's the same law firm that sued Elon Musk, the same lawyer.
[01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:04.170]  All it did was piss him off.
[01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:08.189]  They think they mess with us, and then it makes us go away.
[01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:09.750]  All it does is energize me.
[01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:13.399]  Yeah, well, because that's their worldview.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:25.880]  That's why victim mentality, all of that propaganda and all of that, they teach you all of your kids in these public school systems and college school systems to be weak-minded fools and to be a victim because that's them.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.500]  They're used to rolling over and they're used to whining and crying.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.920]  They're used to that type of stuff.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:32.600]  They can't comprehend people like you.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.319]  Who will be attacked day in, day out, threatened.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.460]  I don't understand how you even sleep.
[01:09:38.539 --> 01:09:44.880]  I like to think I've got some testosterone, but I don't understand how you go to sleep at night with the weight of all this on your shoulders.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.880]  And you look better than ever, by the way, in a totally straight fashion.
[01:09:50.579 --> 01:09:52.520]  You look better than ever.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.739]  And I'm sitting there going, oh my God, the amount of pressure you've got to be under has got to be immense.
[01:09:59.079 --> 01:10:00.600]  And it won't break you.
[01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:02.340]  It will just make you stronger.
[01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:19.899]  Well, yeah, I mean, look, look, look, look, it's all God, and it's the history of what's happening, and I didn't realize over the years, I hadn't gotten depressed, but I'd kind of let myself get in a position where I was like, well, I've done my work, and I'm just, but then I realized when my mother Five,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.239]  six months ago, and my mom is very calm, very nice lady, very smart, but doesn't usually tell me what she wants me to do.
[01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:29.640]  She literally, I grabbed by the arm and I was over visiting my parents and said, these people are criminals.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.479]  I want you to go 100% against them.
[01:10:31.539 --> 01:10:32.579]  I want you to take them down.
[01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:34.159]  And she's got a degree in history.
[01:10:34.539 --> 01:10:37.039]  My mom grew up and read me the Iliads and all that.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.100]  She grabbed by the arm and she said, I want you to come home with your shielder on it.
[01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.409]  And, you know, that's a Spartan thing.
[01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:48.029]  Either, you know, come on victorious with the shield or on it because they used to carry people dead on the shields.
[01:10:48.569 --> 01:10:50.930]  And it's the same thing across the board.
[01:10:50.989 --> 01:10:55.750]  And then, um, Mickey Willis about three months ago, great friend of mine, great filmmaker.
[01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:56.449]  He's actually here today.
[01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:03.270]  Uh, I said, listen, man, you're not taking care of yourself and you're, you know, eating like a pig and doing all this stuff and drinking and stuff.
[01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.250]  You got to stop.
[01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:04.810]  You're too important.
[01:11:04.869 --> 01:11:05.949]  And I said, I want to do it.
[01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:06.670]  I'm going to do it.
[01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.729]  And it was really simple.
[01:11:08.729 --> 01:11:10.869]  And so I just realized I'm in a fight every day.
[01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:14.670]  I've got to continue to be as hardcore as I can.
[01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:16.369]  And so that's what I'm doing.
[01:11:16.449 --> 01:11:17.090]  But enough about me.
[01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:18.609]  This is big news.
[01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:19.890]  A lot of people are tuning in and wanting to know about it.
[01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:21.350]  We learn more.
[01:11:21.449 --> 01:11:22.949]  I'll tell people the auction's over.
[01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.010]  That's its own story.
[01:11:25.329 --> 01:11:27.970]  It's going to be a public auction online, big auction company.
[01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:32.489]  Then we learned Monday afternoon, oh, sorry, now it's sealed bids.
[01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:33.289]  One bid goes in.
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.590]  That's it.
[01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:34.390]  We picked the highest.
[01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.569]  But we reserve the right to keep it to somebody who's lower.
[01:11:36.869 --> 01:11:38.250]  So how is that even an auction?
[01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:43.329]  So I don't think that bodes well for the good guys getting it, but maybe I'm wrong.
[01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:45.329]  But we should...
[01:11:45.329 --> 01:11:46.109]  I don't know why.
[01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:46.909]  They open bids.
[01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:47.390]  It's the biggest.
[01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:48.310]  Why don't we already know?
[01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:49.670]  But they said, oh, well...
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:12:07.079]  You know, it's because we talked to the auctioneer place, or folks I'm working with did, right after the bids were closed, like 1045 Central, and they just said, yep, it can be in an hour, two hours tonight, but it should be by tomorrow morning.
[01:12:07.819 --> 01:12:13.800]  And so I'm just sitting here, I don't know how long it takes to open an envelope and see who has the largest bid here.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:25.140]  Well, whenever they take something that's utterly simple, like an auction, and they start changing the definition of an auction, and then making it complicated, then you know that there's shenanigans and rigging involved.
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.079]  Well, now, come on.
[01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:31.619]  I'm sure it's totally normal that it was gonna be an online public auction, and now it's not.
[01:12:32.319 --> 01:12:33.119]  I mean, come on.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]  You don't need that.
[01:12:34.739 --> 01:12:35.640]  It's like the voting machines.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.479]  You don't need to know what's going on inside there.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.300]  Just come on.
[01:12:39.329 --> 01:12:42.310]  No, I love to hold auctions and then take the lowest bid.
[01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.189]  That's how I became rich, Alex Jones.
[01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:50.069]  Well, they told us, they said, we now reserve the right to give somebody a lower level.
[01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.710]  That sounds like auctions I've heard of.
[01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:59.569]  You don't let people bid up what an auction is, and then you don't have to take the biggest bid.
[01:13:00.029 --> 01:13:01.210]  I'm sure everything's fine.
[01:13:02.279 --> 01:13:07.520]  Yeah, but this is just a reflection of how influential and how powerful you've been in this info war.
[01:13:07.659 --> 01:13:14.699]  They've got to go way out of their way of any precedent, of any sanity, of any legal basis.
[01:13:14.699 --> 01:13:17.659]  They have to go way out of their way because they've got to stop you.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.560]  You have been incredibly influentially important for decades.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:32.460]  And at this turning point right now, with what you've been able to spearhead, you're more dangerous than ever.
[01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:39.840]  And so, it's going to suck for you, and I hate to say it, but I mean, I don't see them letting up.
[01:13:39.939 --> 01:13:41.539]  I think that they're going to go out of there.
[01:13:41.869 --> 01:13:44.210]  They just said, we got to make sure this dude can never talk again.
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:50.569]  They said that they go, we love democracy so much, we got to stop that Hatler's Ronald Blump from destroying democracy.
[01:13:50.569 --> 01:13:54.770]  By the way, that guy over there who's been right about a ton of things, he's not allowed to speak anymore.
[01:13:55.109 --> 01:13:56.970]  These people are insane.
[01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:58.350]  They're dangerous.
[01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.170]  Well, I mean, I want to just move on from me, but people are tuning in to hear this is historic.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:13.380]  I see us having so many victories that whatever pain I got to go through and the attacks and the ongoing lawfare, which is insane, is I signed up for this salty crackers.
[01:14:13.619 --> 01:14:16.300]  So I asked for this.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.399]  I literally prayed for this.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.460]  Just like RFK Jr.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.039]  said, he prays every morning, you know, to be put in a position to try to make our children healthy again.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.939]  When we have the sickest kids on earth by far, we're all falling apart, being killed by the chemicals and the GMO. I mean, this is a blessing.
[01:14:30.449 --> 01:14:36.989]  We're good to go.
[01:14:47.329 --> 01:14:48.149]  Keeping us on air.
[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:53.010]  This is not like a normal show where, oh, you know, got a sponsor, pays for the show.
[01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.750]  Most of the money goes to battling their lawfare, which is ongoing.
[01:14:56.949 --> 01:14:57.989]  I don't even spend our time on it.
[01:14:58.069 --> 01:14:58.850]  It's over the top.
[01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:02.670]  The reason you don't hear about the news anymore is we followed a bunch of counter stuff on them.
[01:15:02.829 --> 01:15:03.329]  We're winning.
[01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.770]  Never hits the news.
[01:15:04.869 --> 01:15:06.170]  And I'm just quiet about it.
[01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:08.890]  And as it develops, we'll talk about it.
[01:15:08.989 --> 01:15:12.869]  But they violated my civil rights, a conspiracy to violate rights.
[01:15:13.329 --> 01:15:14.210]  It's actually criminal.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.399]  And that's what you hear Trump's lawyers talking about with Letitia James now.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.779]  We'll put your fat ass in prison.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.699]  You file more fake stuff and conspiracy to violate President Trump's citizens' rights.
[01:15:24.899 --> 01:15:26.760]  So it's a serious conspiracy against rights.
[01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:30.399]  And what's crazy is the FBI and others bragged that they set all this up.
[01:15:30.479 --> 01:15:39.760]  Well, that's illegal to have the FBI go organize PR firms, sue me, rig courts, have show trials, HBO, and do all this to silence a citizen.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.819]  That's a serious group of felonies right there.
[01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:45.149]  And so I'll let people know that's what's coming next.
[01:15:47.329 --> 01:15:50.729]  Well, yeah, that's good to hear that you're filing counter suits.
[01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:53.109]  I'm glad to see people like Elon Musk.
[01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:57.609]  Listen, the lawfare, the process is the punishment.
[01:15:57.869 --> 01:16:07.439]  And a lot of people from our side In order to engage in standing up for yourself, in order to engage in shutting these criminals down, it's going to cost you money and time.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.739]  And you're starting to see people from our side saying, enough's enough.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.300]  I'm going to start sending lawsuits back in your direction.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:14.979]  I'll drag you through this mess as well.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.180]  And I think Elon Musk is probably the next big one on the target.
[01:16:19.359 --> 01:16:20.500]  They're going to go after that dude.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.279]  Well, they've already been going after him.
[01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:23.579]  No, no, no.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.460]  The clown we put on screen earlier?
[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:31.050]  With the Democrat Party, openly, he's the one suing Elon Musk right now, too.
[01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:32.210]  Yeah.
[01:16:32.609 --> 01:16:37.229]  Well, the Department of Justice says they're gonna go after him, and they're gonna start looking into all of his business.
[01:16:37.329 --> 01:16:40.449]  They're gonna take that fine tooth that they seem to not use for Democrats.
[01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:45.289]  They're gonna scrape that against everything that Elon Musk has ever touched in an attempt to shut him down.
[01:16:45.409 --> 01:16:50.750]  But then again, this guy seems to be built out of Hugh Sterner stuff, and it will only make him stronger.
[01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:58.729]  This is that process, that adage of strong men make good times, good times make weak men, weak men make hard times.
[01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:03.470]  We're just going through that cycle and you're really seeing it shake out right now.
[01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:08.310]  Who are these strong men that are going to lead us out of these hard times?
[01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:12.890]  And it's people like you and Elon Musk and Donald Trump and these other individuals that are fighting against this.
[01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:17.869]  I used to, I've been listening to you forever, Mr.
[01:17:17.970 --> 01:17:22.920]  Jones, and I was raised here in California and...
[01:17:24.489 --> 01:17:27.130]  My early life, there was some religion into it.
[01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:30.770]  And we stopped going to church when I was really young.
[01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:36.050]  And then the propaganda and all of the California stuff kind of set in.
[01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:37.350]  I was like, oh, God's silly.
[01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:38.029]  God's ridiculous.
[01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:48.569]  And man, I am getting a re-baptism in the fight versus good versus evil, that God is real, that there is a power behind the scenes.
[01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.970]  And boy, it is getting illuminated right now as we're going through this process.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.760]  I totally agree, but I want to explain something.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.239]  It's not Elon Musk.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:57.979]  It's not Trump.
[01:17:58.159 --> 01:17:59.119]  It's not Tucker Carlson.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:08.119]  It's us doing the right thing and inspiring people when they tried to kill Trump and people saw how real that was and how organic that was.
[01:18:08.279 --> 01:18:09.520]  Musk said, I've got to fully back in.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.340]  It's the humanity kicking back in.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:22.720]  And there's so many men and women that are successful and happy that don't want power, want to be left alone, but when they get messed with, then it clicks those genetics and those instincts on.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:30.590]  And then, little secret about Trump, myself, and Musk, and Tucker, people, and I know them all, They like this.
[01:18:30.829 --> 01:18:35.710]  Once they get in a fight, I mean, any guy knows that you're not looking for a fight, but somebody goes ahead and knocks you upside the head.
[01:18:35.829 --> 01:18:36.930]  It's all of a sudden you're really excited.
[01:18:37.029 --> 01:18:37.810]  You're not scared at all.
[01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:39.329]  It feels good.
[01:18:39.489 --> 01:18:40.710]  I mean, you're designed to defend yourself.
[01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:45.329]  And so Musk is berserking around in battle joy.
[01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:47.329]  Trump is in battle joy.
[01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.409]  I'm in battle joy.
[01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.529]  And I'm as happy as a pig and you know what.
[01:18:50.909 --> 01:18:54.210]  But what really happened is the public is intimidated.
[01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:55.329]  They're pissed.
[01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:59.869]  Courage is contagious, and people flooded Trump with money.
[01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:02.590]  It was, you know, half of what the Democrats put in.
[01:19:02.829 --> 01:19:09.010]  95% of the corporate money, as you know, went to Harris and Tampon Tim, the hyena and the tampon man.
[01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:15.229]  But Trump took over the Republican Party apparatus in the RNC. They put the lawyers in there.
[01:19:15.329 --> 01:19:16.430]  They stopped a lot of the fraud.
[01:19:16.529 --> 01:19:17.229]  Some of it got through.
[01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:18.689]  Now there's criminal investigations.
[01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:24.189]  And so by engaging and by people getting up off their asses, we're starting to win.
[01:19:24.289 --> 01:19:24.930]  That's why I explain.
[01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:31.310]  These aren't shows you tune into and you're a conservative, you're a populist, you're a free speech person, and that's like a little hobby.
[01:19:31.569 --> 01:19:32.010]  No.
[01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:36.590]  The globalist mission and life is dominating you in total control.
[01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:37.430]  They're control freaks.
[01:19:37.569 --> 01:19:41.770]  So if you don't make it your mission to be free, it's not a hobby.
[01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:42.770]  It's your main mission.
[01:19:42.949 --> 01:19:44.470]  Nothing else is going to be there.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:53.960]  So freedom is not a hobby like, you know, you build balsa wood airplanes or, you know, you have Estes rockets or you play pool, okay?
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.640]  You fight tyranny.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:04.060]  And that's what people have to get, is that's what America's all about, is territorially, aggressively defending our rights.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.500]  Yeah, and it's an ongoing battle.
[01:20:07.819 --> 01:20:11.840]  And you're watching it play out in real time, watching these lefties.
[01:20:12.659 --> 01:20:19.960]  The videos of these people breaking down really shows their lack of humanity.
[01:20:20.239 --> 01:20:32.220]  The vanguard of the left-wing digital militia, all of these really ugly monsters, these weak people pretending that they're stunning, strong, empowered, and brave, of course.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:39.300]  All having complete and utter meltdowns because the regime just completely, it propagandized them and it used them.
[01:20:40.199 --> 01:20:42.979]  And they didn't understand that this is a battle.
[01:20:43.159 --> 01:20:47.140]  They thought that they were just gonna get free stuff and it was gonna be a joy campaign.
[01:20:47.359 --> 01:20:51.359]  And their world was shattered and we're watching it in real time right now.
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.140]  It's fantastic.
[01:20:52.619 --> 01:20:54.899]  Listen, as much as...
[01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:58.729]  There's definitely a part of my humanity that's being stripped away.
[01:20:58.890 --> 01:21:03.029]  Maybe it's because of this digital battle that we've been going through for all these years.
[01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:07.289]  But I am really enjoying and taking enjoyment in watching these people break down.
[01:21:07.369 --> 01:21:08.569]  I hope it continues for a while.
[01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:09.869]  That's my next question.
[01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:14.989]  I've not been negative saying they're going to try to kill him again and going to try to have uprisings and false flags.
[01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:16.090]  They pre-programmed it.
[01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.529]  They called for violent uprisings, Carville and others.
[01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:20.430]  They said they're not going to certify him.
[01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:22.250]  So they've said they're going to do this.
[01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:30.899]  But with 66 days left to the inauguration, We've still got to watch that, and it's still a danger, a cyber attack, something like that.
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:36.260]  But I'm seeing everywhere real signs that they're in full collapse and are being routed.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.680]  And I don't mean they're minions.
[01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:39.760]  I mean the actual technicians and globalists.
[01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:44.300]  I see a lot of people like Zuckerberg and Bezos rolling over.
[01:21:45.039 --> 01:21:47.720]  So I'm actually seeing white flags right now.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.739]  I'm very optimistic, Salty Cracker.
[01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.399]  Well, there was Weirdos were walking around.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:18.100]  And the police somehow, again, miraculously, maybe it was, I don't know, a fall miracle, decided we'll follow them and not let them smash stuff up.
[01:22:18.279 --> 01:22:25.539]  And so you're already seeing in these Democrat-run hellscapes that they've got to put the leash on a little bit because they're not going to get bored.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.039]  With a bunch of federal money after they let their own lunatics burn down their cities this time.
[01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.739]  And so that's already been leashed up a little bit.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.779]  I anticipate, especially during the inauguration, that they'll be allowed to set some stuff on fire again.
[01:22:38.979 --> 01:22:50.159]  But for right now, in a very bizarre way, they are like, okay, well, we can't Let's just set everything on fire right now.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:57.539]  We haven't quite worked out who is still functioning in Washington, D.C. to allow us to let our Democrat scumbags over here set stuff on fire.
[01:22:57.819 --> 01:23:13.689]  So that right there is a little bit of insight that- Stuff is already moving back into a direction of law and order in a place like Seattle.
[01:23:13.909 --> 01:23:17.729]  I mean, they do black tar heroin in the middle of the crosswalks and celebrate it.
[01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:23.170]  It really is a death cult, but let's look at the negative side.
[01:23:23.609 --> 01:23:24.590]  It's a real movement.
[01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:27.449]  These women shaving their head to get ready for the concentration camps.
[01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:28.510]  They want to kill their husbands.
[01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:33.710]  I mean, videos with 50 million views apiece with women giving recipes how to poison their boyfriends.
[01:23:33.869 --> 01:23:36.310]  Even if he's not a Trump supporter, go ahead and kill him.
[01:23:36.829 --> 01:23:41.050]  I mean, this is like Patrick Bateman's spirit has been injected into them.
[01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:42.449]  What the hell's going on there?
[01:23:44.489 --> 01:23:45.569]  You know...
[01:23:46.819 --> 01:23:53.859]  Women, I think, have been hit with a very specific type of propaganda and brainwashing.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:06.979]  They've been told that they are a marginalized and oppressed class in a civilization that used to sacrifice men to make sure that women and children could get off boats before they sank.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:16.920]  And what's happening right now is they have this characterized Men doing their best to make sure that women were upheld and taken care of in the civilization.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.359]  They turned that into some sort of victim mentality.
[01:24:19.979 --> 01:24:33.859]  And with social media, with this Internet 2.0, where we're at this point, where they have basically made a currency out of victimhood status, women have really latched on to that, and they want to be a victim.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:35.060]  Look at what they're doing.
[01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:36.760]  They're making themselves ugly.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.439]  They're like, I'm downtrodden.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.180]  Nobody's...
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.920]  These chicks are making these videos on their $2,000 phone.
[01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:48.659]  They got a $15 latte in the cup holder.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.319]  They're driving a $120,000 car.
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.520]  They're like, oh my God, I'm a victim.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:59.460]  It's all a manipulation of their sense of value in this world right now.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.460]  And these people over here who have exchanged off of that currency of victimhood status are now going to go apoplectic.
[01:25:06.819 --> 01:25:07.199]  That's right.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:07.640]  Stay there.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.260]  Let's come back to that when we return.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:09.880]  Stay with us.
[01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:21.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[01:25:21.829 --> 01:25:25.130]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[01:25:25.409 --> 01:25:35.869]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:37.710]  You got it right here.
[01:25:38.329 --> 01:25:39.470]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:25:39.609 --> 01:25:41.189]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:42.710]  It's not just a detox.
[01:25:42.949 --> 01:25:45.989]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.310]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:51.710]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[01:25:51.949 --> 01:25:54.649]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.899]  And it goes on and on.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.579]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:25:59.739]  They're concentrated.
[01:25:59.979 --> 01:26:00.819]  They're incredible.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:06.279]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30% and 50% off.

[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.859]  All right, really smart guy.
[01:26:11.979 --> 01:26:12.979]  I love watching the show for years.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:13.680]  Salty Cracker.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.899]  Giving us his take on things.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:19.539]  I mean, I can show you, as you know, hours of leftist acting completely insane.
[01:26:19.979 --> 01:26:23.340]  And when you watch this online, you think, oh, that's just us cherry-picking.
[01:26:23.399 --> 01:26:29.520]  No, go to a Democrat event in Austin, Texas, or New York City, or Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:30.460]  They're everywhere.
[01:26:31.359 --> 01:26:33.119]  They make themselves ugly.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:42.239]  I've got videos that I shot myself where they go, I'm ugly, I'm fat, I've got hair under my arms, I love Satan, and I kill babies.
[01:26:44.869 --> 01:26:48.909]  Every time we go out, they come over and they want you to be shocked by them.
[01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:50.470]  That's a quote.
[01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:55.710]  I'm ugly, I'm fat, I've got hair under my arms, and I kill babies.
[01:26:55.829 --> 01:26:58.970]  In fact, that's the McBreen A-Team intro.
[01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:01.750]  That's like 10 years old, but I mean, that's the standard.
[01:27:02.029 --> 01:27:07.229]  We go out to an abortion clinic, we're peacefully protesting across the street, and even starts physically attacking us.
[01:27:07.569 --> 01:27:12.729]  These women are like, we murder our children, we love killing those little bastards, cutting them, I love killing kids!
[01:27:12.909 --> 01:27:13.710]  Ha ha ha!
[01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:17.539]  I mean, it's beyond, like, pedophilia, because this is like getting off on killing kids.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.779]  I've had 50 abortions.
[01:27:18.899 --> 01:27:20.039]  I love slicing them up.
[01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:27.380]  And we go to the statehouse, Owen does a few years ago, and, like, these women in pantsuits and, like, look like they bake cookies for you.
[01:27:27.479 --> 01:27:35.039]  Or, like, we love Satan, and they're old and young, and old women and young women are sticking their tongues up, like, Satan, Satan, kill babies!
[01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.710]  And you're like, they're not just adopting that to shock us.
[01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:40.170]  Something's happened to them.
[01:27:40.489 --> 01:27:42.189]  They're like demonically possessed.
[01:27:42.369 --> 01:27:44.189]  So go out to a leptis event.
[01:27:44.649 --> 01:27:46.569]  And I'm telling you, it is...
[01:27:46.569 --> 01:27:47.489]  Here's footage of it.
[01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:49.510]  And this is the...
[01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:51.010]  There's actually like a 20-minute report.
[01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:51.810]  We ought to find that.
[01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:55.289]  Because all the old stuff, people haven't seen since we got banned seven years ago.
[01:27:55.329 --> 01:27:56.130]  We haven't re-uploaded it.
[01:27:56.329 --> 01:27:58.350]  I mean, there's just hundreds of these...
[01:27:59.389 --> 01:28:15.409]  And so here's a clip I wanted to play of a fellow online making the point about how leftist women think that they are these heroes, that they're battling tyranny,
[01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:19.949]  but when they work with the system, they're actually working for the globalists.
[01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:20.890]  They're working for the empire.
[01:28:20.970 --> 01:28:24.829]  To use a hungering analogy, they're in the main capital district.
[01:28:24.909 --> 01:28:25.270]  Here it is.
[01:28:29.819 --> 01:28:34.520]  I love this so much because this is the exact reason why Trump won the presidency.
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:42.979]  I'm not trying to be rude, I'm not trying to be a dick, but it is liberal narcissism like this, which is why Trump is going to be president again.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:45.060]  You are not Katniss Everdeen.
[01:28:45.159 --> 01:28:47.239]  You have nothing in common with Katniss Everdeen.
[01:28:47.779 --> 01:28:50.859]  If Katniss Everdeen existed, she lives in Gaza.
[01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:54.050]  Alright, she doesn't live in the United States.
[01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:56.029]  She doesn't vote in presidential elections.
[01:28:56.630 --> 01:28:58.189]  That's a privilege.
[01:28:59.029 --> 01:29:02.109]  American women are the most privileged women in human history.
[01:29:02.949 --> 01:29:03.930]  Full stop.
[01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:09.289]  American women in the year 2024 are the most privileged women in human history.
[01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:15.930]  And you are dressing up like a girl who was raised in a concentration camp.
[01:29:17.089 --> 01:29:33.430]  Because you think you have a relationship to her, but in the reality of the situation is you live in the capital, you voted for the person who is continuing the Hunger Games, and you're upset that the other person who's going to continue the Hunger Games won while the capital is protected.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.359]  This is insane.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:51.600]  Alright, I agree with 95% of that, but the idea that Trump is the capital president, the 95% of corporate donations, 95.4 was the last number, were given to Kamala Harris.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.439]  They tried to kill him twice.
[01:29:53.819 --> 01:29:57.060]  Lawfare, they tried to destroy all his businesses.
[01:29:58.239 --> 01:30:00.680]  Trump wants to stop the wars, control the border.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:04.500]  Trump, I don't agree with everything Trump does, but Trump means well, and Trump definitely...
[01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:19.630]  Trump is a person of the people, but responding to the crazy women, and then his point is right about how they think they're the rebels when they're actually the stormtroopers, but then the false claim that Trump is a flavor of the establishment.
[01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:20.430]  What do you say to that?
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.380]  The foundation of what he's saying is correct.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.260]  The women in this country, I'm not saying that you have it perfect.
[01:30:28.659 --> 01:30:30.079]  A lot of people misinterpret this.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.039]  Like, oh, well, it's not perfect.
[01:30:31.119 --> 01:30:32.020]  I'm not saying it's perfect.
[01:30:32.119 --> 01:30:33.159]  There is no place that's perfect.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:44.680]  But this notion that, yeah, you're some sort of resistance fighter and freedom fighter that you're standing up against the man, you're upholding What is actually oppressing people in this place?
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.619]  And you've been so propagandized.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.779]  The antidote to this is everything that you now hate because you've been so effectively propagandized.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.500]  These people hate Alex Jones.
[01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:56.020]  They hate Donald Trump.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:59.359]  They love Donald Trump.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.600]  Go back, what, 12 years?
[01:31:01.659 --> 01:31:02.340]  Not even 12 years.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.439]  They love this dude.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.039]  They loved Elon Musk two years ago.
[01:31:06.399 --> 01:31:09.060]  These idiots get whipped around on a dime because they're stupid.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.880]  And they're full of propaganda.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.359]  I used to think that people would resist propaganda, Alex.
[01:31:14.539 --> 01:31:23.020]  But what I've come to realize is that there is a gigantic population of people, and certainly a lot of women out there, they are addicted to propaganda.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.100]  They want it.
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.060]  They crave it.
[01:31:26.119 --> 01:31:26.920]  They seek it out.
[01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:33.939]  And their heads get whipped around, and you're now watching them cosplay and pretend to be these victims.
[01:31:34.359 --> 01:31:40.939]  Meanwhile, This place right here is the best place for everybody, by the way.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:45.500]  As long as you're an American with American ideals, this is the best place for you.
[01:31:45.979 --> 01:31:49.560]  And they're participating in the destruction of this place at their own demise.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.720]  They can't comprehend it, again, because they're a little bit stupid.
[01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:59.770]  Well, look, I use the Nigerian email scam as an allegory or a parallel to this.
[01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:02.170]  And for people that don't know what it is, most people know.
[01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:06.250]  That's why I try to use a parallel or example that most people know about.
[01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:10.609]  But it started when email got big in the mid-90s or early 90s.
[01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:12.130]  And we've all gotten them.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.800]  And I knew some people in business that got roped in.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960]  Some distant family got roped in by it.
[01:32:17.979 --> 01:32:18.779]  It works like this.
[01:32:19.859 --> 01:32:25.159]  Prince Abubu is a Nigerian prince, and he needs $10,000, but he's chosen you.
[01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:29.020]  He's going to give you $500,000, or whatever the number is, if you give him $10,000.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:33.920]  Now, they may send the email out to 10 million people, and only 100 are dumb enough to believe their ships come in.
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:40.180]  And then you give them the $10,000, and they go, well, Prince Abubu needs $20,000 more, but now it's $1 million you're getting.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.380]  And then people's families tell them, hey, this is a scam.
[01:32:43.619 --> 01:32:44.640]  This is a ripoff.
[01:32:44.819 --> 01:32:45.479]  Don't do it.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.159]  You're being set up.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:54.539]  But because they want to believe their ships come in, sometimes people give three or four times scams.
[01:32:54.899 --> 01:32:57.960]  The more they invest in the scam, the more they don't want to believe they were wrong.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.460]  They keep doubling down.
[01:32:59.659 --> 01:33:03.619]  And I knew a talk show host who was on GCN like 20 years.
[01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:05.430]  Three, four years ago.
[01:33:05.529 --> 01:33:06.229]  He was a young guy.
[01:33:06.909 --> 01:33:08.529]  He was doing a nighttime show.
[01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:09.189]  I forget his name.
[01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.329]  But I used to listen to the network a lot.
[01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:12.449]  So I'm listening on the app.
[01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:15.890]  And I'm listening to him while I'm driving the car one time.
[01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:20.989]  And he starts saying, man, these Nigerians are going to fund my show and give me like $20 million.
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:24.149]  And I gave him $20,000, but I'm going to give him more.
[01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:26.789]  And I call up the board during a break.
[01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:28.609]  And I go, hey, let me talk to the host.
[01:33:28.789 --> 01:33:29.949]  I said, dude, that's a scam.
[01:33:30.729 --> 01:33:34.189]  The next day, he goes on air and attacks me and says, Alex Jones is jealous.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.399]  Then he gave him even more money, flipped out, had a nervous breakdown, and quit like a month later.
[01:33:39.779 --> 01:33:45.359]  But he thought I was trying to get in the way of his big ship coming in.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.920]  And that's what it is with these women.
[01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:48.020]  I think they're getting free tuition.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.140]  People are getting reparations.
[01:33:49.479 --> 01:33:52.539]  It's going to be this Valhalla that Bernie Sanders promises.
[01:33:52.539 --> 01:34:00.600]  Just once they make the conservatives, you know, do what we're supposed to, once we follow Cloward and Piven, once we have the Great Reset, the bugs are going to be delicious.
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:07.659]  So they're in the cult, they've been conned, and how do you get them to make the adult decision that they're in a cult?
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.420]  How do you deprogram someone in a cult, Salty Cracker?
[01:34:11.699 --> 01:34:12.659]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.279]  That's way above my abilities, but that's exactly true.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.640]  That's why they hate us so much.
[01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:30.779]  They think that these ugly chicks in Portland, while they're walking their dogs and they're stepping over poop, They think the poop on the sidewalk is our fault.
[01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:32.300]  They think the Republicans did that.
[01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:42.460]  They would be living in this utopia where everybody's singing kumbaya and exchanging needles if those dastardly Republicans would get out of the way.
[01:34:42.539 --> 01:34:45.920]  We're the only thing keeping these civilizations from falling in on themselves.
[01:34:46.039 --> 01:34:49.779]  The only reason why Seattle still has electricity is because of Republicans at this point, you idiots.
[01:34:50.199 --> 01:35:00.760]  And so I don't think that there's a whole lot of sense And these ugly chicks in this 4B movement where they're not going to have sex with dudes, by the way, which is hilarious.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:01.840]  You stupid idiots.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.899]  Like, that's exactly what we wanted, by the way.
[01:35:04.079 --> 01:35:06.979]  You were using birth control as contraception.
[01:35:06.979 --> 01:35:10.500]  Well, notice they're not giving anything up because no one's having sex with them to begin with.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.119]  I don't mean to be mean.
[01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:11.659]  It's obvious.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.359]  Well, it's like all the leftists that said they were going to leave America.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520]  Like Michael Cohen.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.079]  Oh, now they say they're not leaving America.
[01:35:18.239 --> 01:35:19.359]  Well, we knew you weren't leaving.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.800]  The one thing we know is you lie perpetually.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.020]  So when you tell us you guarantee something, we know it's the opposite.
[01:35:25.989 --> 01:35:35.729]  Yeah, and so I wouldn't put much time or effort in trying to, I don't know, decultify some of these lefty lunatics.
[01:35:35.989 --> 01:35:38.510]  I think that that ship has kind of sailed.
[01:35:38.710 --> 01:35:46.569]  When you're that deep into this that you don't understand, you guys were screaming, we want to kill babies.
[01:35:46.909 --> 01:35:53.050]  Again, I've seen those clips on your show where the lunatics screaming how she's had 21 abortions and she enjoys it.
[01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:54.630]  Idiots, that's why you lost.
[01:35:55.789 --> 01:36:05.149]  Normal humans out there don't want- Listen, when it comes to abortion, even when I was a lefty, you shouldn't have been promoting it.
[01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:08.449]  It's something that you should be upset about.
[01:36:08.609 --> 01:36:10.149]  It's something that's bad.
[01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:13.409]  But you idiots have turned this into a celebratory thing.
[01:36:13.449 --> 01:36:14.949]  You guys make cakes about this.
[01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.449]  That's how you lost normal humans over here.
[01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:21.289]  So we have already reached those normal people.
[01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:28.989]  Again, they're not participating at the levels that I think they need to in order for us to get out of this in a quicker pace.
[01:36:29.289 --> 01:36:31.010]  But they are at least participating.
[01:36:31.090 --> 01:36:34.569]  And it's all the active stuff that we've been hammering on.
[01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:39.109]  No, we don't want dudes in daughters' bathrooms, you weirdos.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.340]  And they kept screaming, oh, this is a fringe idea.
[01:36:43.439 --> 01:36:44.159]  Don't worry about it.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:48.039]  And look at these turfs or what are these stupid terms that these idiots come up with.
[01:36:48.319 --> 01:36:58.859]  But in reality, off of social media, in the private homes of normal human beings, everybody acknowledges that it's stupid to put dudes in women's sports.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.520]  It's stupid to allow dudes in women's bathrooms.
[01:37:01.699 --> 01:37:03.939]  It's stupid to celebrate killing babies.
[01:37:04.079 --> 01:37:05.380]  And you saw that.
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:11.239]  With this trifecta of Donald Trump and the Republican Party in just the last- Can you believe that?
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.859]  It's taken a week plus to still count these votes.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.319]  They're still counting in some of these places?
[01:37:15.619 --> 01:37:16.619]  We should be arresting them.
[01:37:16.619 --> 01:37:20.460]  Well, it's clear the Senate race was stolen in Milwaukee.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.640]  There's news reports.
[01:37:21.779 --> 01:37:23.300]  They admit illegals were counted.
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.960]  The Republican was winning until they closed down.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.420]  And at 3 a.m., all the votes go for the other person.
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:31.220]  Musk is exposing it.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.579]  He's got a big threat with all the documents.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:39.300]  The Democratic Party, a Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, is trying to change the outcome of the election by counting non-citizen votes, which is illegal.
[01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:43.859]  We saw all those federal courts saying illegals can vote right before the election.
[01:37:44.039 --> 01:37:47.180]  The Supreme Court says illegals can't vote in Virginia, pull their names off.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.680]  That was a wake-up call.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.659]  People that are informed and follow the actual facts know illegals are voting, and publicly.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.359]  But to have them deny it and then have to admit it now, again, is a big wake-up call.
[01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.500]  And I think Trump needs an Election Integrity Commission...
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:12.479]  Yeah, this has to be, he's got so many top agendas, but this has got to be up there.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:17.239]  We cannot have an election system where you count four days.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:29.060]  I mean, India knows that's stupid, and not to crap on you Indians over there, but- Every country out there except us recognizes that the longer it takes to count ballots, again, the more shenanigans.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:30.960]  There's a mathematical axiom in there somewhere.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.220]  But the longer this drags out, the more vectors of attack for criminal minds.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:37.000]  And then it always goes for Democrats.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.500]  And then we have all the videos and Dominion this time going, oh, it is a nationwide glitch flipping Republican straight tickets to Democrat.
[01:38:44.829 --> 01:38:47.489]  Oh, I thought that didn't exist four years ago when people claimed it happened.
[01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:53.270]  Now they admit a week before the election, well, there is a nationwide glitch flipping from Republican to Democrat.
[01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:57.329]  Oh, why is the glitches always flipping from Republican to Democrat?
[01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:02.050]  Because they changed the definition of glitch, apparently, in the background.
[01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:06.470]  But yeah, no, this is, again, they told you these things aren't hooked up to the internet.
[01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:10.989]  They told you that, well, first of all, they tried to arrest people for questioning the 2020 election.
[01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:15.449]  You could question every election up to 2020, not 2020, and now you're back.
[01:39:15.489 --> 01:39:16.329]  Well, they didn't try.
[01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:22.729]  They indicted Trump in Georgia and it said in there, in the indictment, that he created conspiracy theories.
[01:39:22.949 --> 01:39:28.050]  Well, even if he made it up, which he's been proven right, he didn't, it's his right to say the moon's made out of cheese.
[01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:32.529]  Since when do you indict somebody for, quote, conspiracy theories questioning the election?
[01:39:33.289 --> 01:39:34.329]  When you're still in an election.
[01:39:37.079 --> 01:39:37.399]  Unbelievable.
[01:39:37.699 --> 01:39:39.439]  So I've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.659]  I want to get your take just on topics I haven't raised.
[01:39:42.859 --> 01:39:46.140]  I have a hundred questions left, but what else is on your radar?
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:47.720]  And then I want you to answer this question.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.880]  Let's not celebrate too much because we could lose this thing.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.619]  It's like having a fish up to the boat and the line breaks.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.399]  I don't think the fish is fully in the boat.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.399]  We're kind of gaffing and it's halfway in the boat right now.
[01:39:57.069 --> 01:39:57.869]  We've got to get him in.
[01:39:58.909 --> 01:40:00.529]  Yes, we've got to deport the illegals.
[01:40:01.029 --> 01:40:02.210]  Yes, they're replacing migration.
[01:40:02.449 --> 01:40:03.489]  Yes, they're being brought here.
[01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:04.350]  It'll bankrupt the country.
[01:40:04.890 --> 01:40:09.170]  Yes, they're a permanent underclass, but we've got to get the criminals, the traffickers, the smugglers first.
[01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:18.069]  If they accidentally arrest some citizens or something, the media is really going to try to derail what Trump's doing.
[01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:21.409]  So I think Trump needs to be careful about that.
[01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.909]  What do you think?
[01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:26.109]  No, 100% spot on.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.979]  There are so many landmines out there.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:33.760]  That's why I think it seems a little bit quiet right now.
[01:40:34.199 --> 01:40:40.000]  We have got to keep our head on a swivel and we definitely got to stay frosty because this isn't over.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.399]  I'm not trying to doom anybody.
[01:40:41.399 --> 01:40:44.239]  I'm not trying to blackpill anybody out and trying to be a realist here.
[01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.689]  This will be a continually ongoing fight.
[01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:49.250]  It's going to change how it looks.
[01:40:49.449 --> 01:40:53.010]  Again, you pioneered the info war.
[01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:55.310]  It's a completely different war spectrum.
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:57.670]  We're in fifth generational warfare and it will continue to evolve.
[01:40:57.850 --> 01:40:59.310]  We gotta be careful for this.
[01:40:59.649 --> 01:41:03.229]  And he's got a hell of an agenda that he needs to take place.
[01:41:03.789 --> 01:41:05.229]  In a very short amount of time.
[01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:16.170]  And I think the seemingly quietness of what's going on, I think some of it's due to them trying to make sure that they can steal some seats in the House and some of these other votes.
[01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:22.949]  But I think right now, you can always tell what they're doing by doing the inverse of what they're saying.
[01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:28.409]  They keep telling you, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden said it today, Trump is at the White House today.
[01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:31.449]  They're like, we're having a peaceful transition of power.
[01:41:31.649 --> 01:41:35.810]  So you better bet your balls it will be anything but a peaceful transition of power.
[01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:39.529]  They are laying landmines all over the place and they're going to try to get the dude arrested.
[01:41:39.529 --> 01:41:41.109]  They're going to try to get him impeached immediately.
[01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:46.270]  They're going to do everything that they can to obstruct and he needs to be laser focused.
[01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:50.810]  Some of these picks that he's doing lately look fantastic.
[01:41:52.750 --> 01:42:04.109]  He seems to have learned a lot of lessons from that first administration and pick people who have been Messed with by the machine.
[01:42:04.289 --> 01:42:05.229]  Messed with by the establishment.
[01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:07.130]  People who want retribution.
[01:42:07.369 --> 01:42:09.390]  I know that Trump says we're not doing retribution.
[01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:14.090]  But I think there's a mandate from his base that we hold people accountable.
[01:42:14.329 --> 01:42:17.069]  Because these people are the ones laying the landmines right now.
[01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.989]  They committed the crimes.
[01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:19.050]  They spied on your first term.
[01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:21.029]  God knows what they've been doing the last four years.
[01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:22.470]  Attacking us.
[01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:24.869]  Listen, Trump's future in his life hangs in the balance.
[01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:26.390]  Our future does as well.
[01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:28.350]  Justice is not about retribution.
[01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:30.430]  It's about survival.
[01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:34.689]  I mean, that's why you punish bad people so others see it and are scared to do it again.
[01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:38.909]  I mean, he absolutely has to go after these people.
[01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:45.090]  And the number one thing is saying not just we're going to stop the open borders, we're going to find the traffic kids and we're going to prosecute the traffickers.
[01:42:45.329 --> 01:42:50.670]  That is the right thing to do and it is a political winner and a weapon.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.260]  Yeah.
[01:42:52.819 --> 01:43:07.960]  Listen, I think that we are, again, not to blackfill, but you need to be aware that if you thought things were crazy before the election, look at how boiled we are, how normalized we've become.
[01:43:08.539 --> 01:43:10.680]  Trump was shot in his head.
[01:43:11.659 --> 01:43:17.659]  A dude was in the bushes getting ready to take shots at him again, and we're just kind of going along, going along, going along.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.020]  It's not going to get less crazy.
[01:43:21.239 --> 01:43:25.439]  These people are in a very dangerous position of being held accountable.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.439]  You get some good people in there.
[01:43:27.779 --> 01:43:36.680]  You get a few key top individuals who are galvanized by the fight, and they start holding some of these people accountable.
[01:43:36.859 --> 01:43:37.979]  Maybe you take it international.
[01:43:38.039 --> 01:43:39.239]  I have no idea.
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.239]  We've committed a lot of crimes.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.520]  And by we, I mean these criminal scumbags of Washington, D.C., blowing up gas pipelines in the Baltic.
[01:43:47.789 --> 01:43:51.350]  Maybe some of these people get held accountable at a higher level.
[01:43:51.489 --> 01:43:55.609]  I'm not quite sure, but they will kick back hard and they will set stuff on fire.
[01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:56.550]  So please be prepared.
[01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:58.609]  We have the initiative.
[01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:59.649]  We're going over the top.
[01:43:59.789 --> 01:44:05.930]  We're winning, but it's ours to lose, and people exactly better keep your head on a swivel, better understand history's happening.
[01:44:05.989 --> 01:44:10.010]  I want to play a clip of Steve Bannon, because you talk about victims, and he's not a victim.
[01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:16.229]  He's not playing one on TV, but they're trying to put him in prison again and listen to his defiant spirit.
[01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:17.489]  People think, I've gone through stuff?
[01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:18.170]  No.
[01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:19.210]  I mean, Trump...
[01:44:20.659 --> 01:44:24.699]  Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, I mean, they have really been plowed under my own co-host.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.899]  I spent four months in prison for peacefully saying, don't go in the Capitol with me.
[01:44:29.279 --> 01:44:37.239]  Four months in prison in America, and they tried to indict me for it, and it came on the Washington Post, and I knew this was true because my lawyers found out about it and confirmed it.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:52.039]  The head of the Justice Department decided two years ago, they had the indictment ready in D.C., they were going to indict me for conspiracy of sedition and attacking the Capitol, and even the head of the Justice Department killed it and said, that's too political, no one's going to buy it.
[01:44:52.159 --> 01:44:53.500]  That was in the Washington Post, so...
[01:44:54.410 --> 01:45:02.649]  There's some, and I'm not saying Merrick Garland's sane, but compared to some of his underlings, they need to really think and regroup and go away for a while.
[01:45:02.710 --> 01:45:05.329]  If I was them, that's their best tactic to not get completely destroyed.
[01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:11.489]  If they try to push through with a civil war or something, it's going to be horrible, but in the end, I don't see how they win.
[01:45:11.729 --> 01:45:21.829]  I mean, people are awake right now, so I would just call for peace and calm and obviously no violence, and I would advise the globalists to be careful because they need to know when they're beaten.
[01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:23.310]  Here's the clip of Steve Bannon today.
[01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:31.609]  The people rendered their verdict on all this lawfare on last Tuesday, one week ago.
[01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:37.409]  And like I have worked on for years and years and years, the whole country came together.
[01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:43.869]  Working class people all over came together and they rejected what's going on in this court, what's going on with President Trump.
[01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:55.239]  The lawfare of Tish James and Alvin Bragg and Jack Smith and Merrick Garland has been rejected by a landslide by the American people.
[01:45:55.539 --> 01:46:03.399]  So the one thing I have to say to Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, Jack Smith, Tish James, Alvin Bragg, you wait.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.739]  The hunted are about to become the hunters.
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:07.939]  Thank you very much.
[01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:10.770]  And we have to do it.
[01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:13.210]  It's like at the end of World War II, we couldn't just leave Hitler there.
[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:15.470]  I mean, they call us Hitler.
[01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:17.210]  They're the closest thing I've ever seen in my lifetime to it.
[01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:29.189]  So looking at this and watching all of this unfold, what do you think Trump, Trump's got a lot of great agendas, but what do you think his first and foremost agenda should be?
[01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:34.529]  First and foremost, Steve Bannon, that was incredible.
[01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:36.170]  Steve Bannon is a bad dote.
[01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:40.470]  And I'm sure he's going to be integral into Trump's current administration.
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:47.649]  And I think that one of the first things that he needs to do is he needs to really take that border.
[01:46:47.869 --> 01:46:53.489]  Because I think this would, it seems to me, and I'm an idiot, but it seems like this would be the easiest thing to fix.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:47:14.460]  Number one, you secure that border up, you reinitiate what Joe Biden destroyed on day one of his stolen term, and you start holding accountable American corporations that are funding the destruction of our labor in this country and get these people predominantly to self deport.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:21.319]  If you turn off the freebies, you turn off the drivers, stop making it easy to break into our country.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.479]  Stop giving illegals $4,000 a month federally.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.140]  Exactly.
[01:47:24.319 --> 01:47:25.960]  You prosecute the people hiring them.
[01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:27.520]  That'll stop it right there.
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:28.979]  Yeah.
[01:47:29.279 --> 01:47:30.060]  Stop paying.
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:31.380]  Stop giving them apartment.
[01:47:31.579 --> 01:47:33.119]  We got homeless veterans on the street.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:37.159]  Stop giving illegal aliens free apartments for years, by the way.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:37.579]  Look at this.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.119]  This is madness.
[01:47:38.399 --> 01:47:39.779]  You turned that off.
[01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:47.229]  A ton of these people who are going through the Darien Gap right now will get the message and turn the hell around.
[01:47:47.409 --> 01:47:56.909]  Then you start actually arresting these criminals who are preying on American citizens, and you keep them in prison here and send the bill to Venezuela.
[01:47:56.909 --> 01:47:57.850]  Because I don't trust Venezuela.
[01:47:58.029 --> 01:48:02.310]  You send these people back to Venezuela who are rapists and murderers, Venezuela is just going to send them right back in our direction.
[01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:05.409]  So let's detain them here, but send the bill to those places.
[01:48:05.710 --> 01:48:05.930]  I agree.
[01:48:06.069 --> 01:48:06.550]  Last point.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:19.680]  The judge in the state-rigged fraud case of Trump, the fraud's the case, was going to have the sentencing of Trump four years in Rikers Island, they were saying, on the 26th.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:20.520]  Now he's moved it back.
[01:48:20.739 --> 01:48:28.779]  You think they've got the huevos, because he can't pardon himself from a state deal, folks, to actually try to put Trump in prison, or do you think they're going to get smart and drop it?
[01:48:30.409 --> 01:48:32.510]  Well, I don't expect them to get smart.
[01:48:32.789 --> 01:48:38.609]  I'm hoping that they understand that the predicate for which they've arrested him at the state level depends on the federal stuff.
[01:48:38.789 --> 01:48:47.409]  So if he can pardon himself from the federal stuff, that kind of dissolves the basis for what they've arrested him for in the state, as far as if I have that right.
[01:48:48.989 --> 01:49:01.789]  I think if they were smart and had any type of self-preservation, they would say, listen, it's easier to obstruct him over the next four years than it is to set this place on fire.
[01:49:01.909 --> 01:49:06.189]  They'll set this place on fire hurts them in the long run because they want to continue stealing from us.
[01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:08.670]  And so they set this place on fire.
[01:49:09.729 --> 01:49:15.069]  That's going to impact their bottom line, and it would be easier for them, I imagine, to just obstruct.
[01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:15.789]  But who knows?
[01:49:15.909 --> 01:49:16.569]  They're crazy, Alex.
[01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.590]  You're right.
[01:49:17.729 --> 01:49:18.350]  Salty Cracker.
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:21.180]  Saltmustflow.com.
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:21.899]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:22.039 --> 01:49:22.720]  Talk to you again, brother.
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.060]  Brother, thank you so much for having me.
[01:49:25.239 --> 01:49:25.760]  Huge honor.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.659]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:49:26.779 --> 01:49:27.260]  Honored to have you.
[01:49:27.659 --> 01:49:29.000]  All right, we're going to start the next hour.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.819]  I got a ton of clips, a ton of developments, a ton of news, bad news.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.000]  They just put John Thune in and the Senate really bad.
[01:49:36.119 --> 01:49:37.319]  The swamp did that, not Trump.
[01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:39.359]  The Republican senators went against the people.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.779]  Judge Joe Brown's coming up always on fire and more.
[01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:45.510]  I'm barely plugging, even though it could be our last day at InfoWars.
[01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:46.789]  Need to support our sponsor.
[01:49:46.989 --> 01:49:49.250]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great patron apparel.
[01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.890]  They're amazing.

[01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:00.670]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:50:00.939 --> 01:50:07.140]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.680]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:14.539]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels over foreseen.
[01:50:15.319 --> 01:50:30.229]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party ally with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:32.949]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:36.210]  But we can't control everything individually.
[01:50:36.210 --> 01:50:38.029]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:39.850]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:40.890]  And I've got faith.
[01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:59.890]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug-resistant and Antibiotic resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.

[01:52:56.670 --> 01:53:07.090]  We're going to have our sponsors like drjonesnaturals.com and the alexjonesstore.com for the equipment, the satellite uplinks, the crew, the servers, the reporters, the writers, just all of it.
[01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:09.949]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.

[01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:12.829]  We cannot do it without your support.

[01:53:38.819 --> 01:53:41.000]  Now go to drjonesnaturals.com and I thank you for your support.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:53.500]  Well, breaking right now, Ivanka Trump just posted on X. Jim Jordan says U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas should be tried for treason.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.779]  For what?
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.739]  He did our southern border and the kidnapping and smuggling of children.
[01:54:00.819 --> 01:54:02.140]  That's the parody account.
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:06.859]  But the point is, it definitely needs to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:07.119 --> 01:54:12.560]  And that needs to be front and center on Trump's agenda.
[01:54:13.199 --> 01:54:20.000]  Here's a little compilation that's not a parody account of the last borders are Kamala Harris versus the new one.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.239]  Up with education, down, down with deportation!
[01:54:24.359 --> 01:54:28.020]  Up, up with education, down, down with deportation!
[01:54:28.119 --> 01:54:29.039]  I got a message.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:36.060]  To the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden's released in our country in violation of federal law, you better start packing now.
[01:54:38.699 --> 01:54:39.920]  We are going to the border.
[01:54:40.039 --> 01:54:40.939]  We've been to the border.
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:45.680]  So this whole thing about the border, we've been to the border.
[01:54:46.039 --> 01:54:47.180]  We've been to the border.
[01:54:47.199 --> 01:54:48.060]  You haven't been to the border.
[01:54:49.119 --> 01:54:50.699]  And I haven't been to Europe.
[01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.670]  I don't understand the point that you're making.
[01:54:54.890 --> 01:54:58.329]  I hear a lot of people say, you know, the talk of a mass deportation is racist.
[01:54:59.229 --> 01:55:02.310]  It's threatening to immigrant community.
[01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.970]  It's not threatening to the immigrant community.
[01:55:05.130 --> 01:55:08.069]  It should be threatening to the illegal immigrant community.
[01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:12.069]  Is there a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families?
[01:55:13.289 --> 01:55:14.210]  Of course there is.
[01:55:16.050 --> 01:55:17.470]  Families can be deported together.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.960]  It is not an emergency.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.539]  We are not facing a crisis.
[01:55:24.039 --> 01:55:37.479]  We have a president of the United States who has created a fiction about a crisis at the border, and he has held up the United States government and its workers around his vanity project called a wall.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.800]  To the criminal cartels in Mexico.
[01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:45.470]  You've smuggled enough fentanyl across this country to kill 148,000 young Americans.
[01:55:45.829 --> 01:55:50.170]  You have killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world combined.
[01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:53.250]  And that's when President Trump gets back in office.
[01:55:53.529 --> 01:55:58.569]  He's going to designate you a terrorist organization and he's going to wipe you off the face of the earth.
[01:55:58.789 --> 01:55:59.369]  You're done!
[01:55:59.689 --> 01:56:00.569]  You're done!
[01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:09.750]  The idea that he is trying to say that we have people that are trying to invade our country to commit mass crime.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:14.079]  Is a crisis of his own making.
[01:56:14.539 --> 01:56:17.479]  I specialize in transnational criminal organizations.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.100]  That wall ain't gonna stop them?
[01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:20.479]  No.
[01:56:31.529 --> 01:56:34.689]  There's a 600% increase in sex trafficking on women and children.
[01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:40.510]  Border Patrol has arrested more terrorists coming across the border in one month than Trump had in four years.
[01:56:41.050 --> 01:56:46.109]  This is the biggest national security vulnerability this country's ever had.
[01:56:46.409 --> 01:56:52.369]  Donald Trump will be the president and I'll be in the middle of running the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen.
[01:56:53.569 --> 01:56:54.729]  I am not for a wall.
[01:56:54.989 --> 01:56:56.329]  We don't need to build a wall.
[01:56:56.529 --> 01:56:58.350]  This is a crisis of his own making.
[01:56:58.529 --> 01:57:01.869]  The president of the United States has a vanity project that he doesn't want to give up.
[01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:04.189]  It's the president's vanity project.
[01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:09.590]  This issue is about a vanity project for this president.
[01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:11.449]  The president's vanity project?
[01:57:11.649 --> 01:57:12.529]  Let me be very clear.
[01:57:12.609 --> 01:57:14.770]  I'm not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances.
[01:57:14.949 --> 01:57:16.010]  It will not end with a wall.
[01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:17.090]  It will not end with a wall.
[01:57:17.210 --> 01:57:17.989]  It will not end with a wall?
[01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:18.270]  No.
[01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:19.090]  All right.
[01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:20.109]  He comes back.
[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:21.210]  I come back.
[01:57:21.369 --> 01:57:22.810]  We fix this shit.
[01:57:26.630 --> 01:57:35.010]  All right, the amazing, super smart, and entertaining, and one hell of an orator, Judge Joe Brown.
[01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:41.869]  I mean, I've loved him for years, but my God, the clips of him in speeches the last few months have just been some of the best stuff in this campaign.
[01:57:42.529 --> 01:57:43.189]  Nailing it.
[01:57:43.529 --> 01:57:47.449]  And he joins us to talk about the big victory, what the deep state's planning, and more.
[01:57:47.970 --> 01:57:50.510]  I was just talking to Roger during that clip we just played.
[01:57:50.789 --> 01:57:55.350]  They're definitely trying to steal Pennsylvania with a sneak attack with illegal alien votes that Elon Musk is talking about.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:00.800]  They definitely stole Wisconsin, so we need criminal investigations right now.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:06.159]  Yeah, we mitigated the fraud because the landslide was so big, but they're trying to steal stuff right now.
[01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:11.800]  So Judge Joe Brown's our guest for the next 45 minutes, then Roger Stone pops in and more.
[01:58:11.939 --> 01:58:15.319]  We're back in 60 seconds with the great Judge Joe Brown.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:18.260]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now and tell people you don't know, tune in now.
[01:58:18.399 --> 01:58:23.220]  Share the live feed from Real Alex Jones on X and what could be my last broadcast from the M4 studios.
[01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:31.109]  Well, American badass Judge Joe Brown is my guest for the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:33.409]  The Roger Stone has huge breaking election fraud news.
[01:58:33.850 --> 01:58:35.210]  Emergency popping in.
[01:58:35.369 --> 01:58:36.670]  I'll continue on to the fourth hour.
[01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:37.890]  This will be my last broadcast.
[01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.550]  Could be my last broadcast for Info Wars.
[01:58:39.869 --> 01:58:41.590]  For sale up on auction.
[01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:46.710]  The left in their fake judgments where the judges found me guilty and had show trials.
[01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:47.550]  Did not want money.
[01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:48.130]  They said that.
[01:58:48.210 --> 01:58:49.109]  I played the clips here.
[01:58:49.409 --> 01:58:50.649]  They want me silenced.
[01:58:50.789 --> 01:58:51.670]  Well, good luck.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.020]  Backup studios, satellite uplinks, all of it.
[01:58:55.079 --> 01:58:56.760]  The listeners are supporting us.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:59.220]  The funds are coming in at realalexjones.com.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.100]  We could use more, but we're able to operate.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.439]  And we're just bigger than ever.
[01:59:03.659 --> 01:59:05.619]  Because freedom is exciting.
[01:59:05.779 --> 01:59:06.439]  It's contagious.
[01:59:06.699 --> 01:59:07.640]  Courage is contagious.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:13.140]  And when they shot Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, they insured that landslide that overrode the fraud.
[01:59:13.399 --> 01:59:15.300]  Now we're catching them in all the fraud.
[01:59:15.859 --> 01:59:22.020]  This is the beginning of the end for the blue blood globalist, Klaus Schwab, King Charles, Bill Gates types.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:25.899]  If we stay frosty, And understand what's happening in my view.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.000]  But I gotta tell you, I've known Judge Joe Brown for a long time.
[01:59:28.159 --> 01:59:29.619]  And I've been following him for decades.
[01:59:29.819 --> 01:59:32.180]  But man, he nailed it during this campaign.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:35.140]  He was out there kicking ass.
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:38.800]  And he's one of the most valuable players in the fight.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.199]  JudgeJoeBrownTV on X. The JudgeJoeBrownShow.com And I just love this guy.
[01:59:46.410 --> 01:59:47.289]  Total Americana.
[01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:50.329]  And yeah, I am celebrating him because I love him.
[01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:53.729]  There's still a lot of America left in us.
[01:59:54.149 --> 02:00:00.529]  And he's the good vaccine we need to inject into our souls to come back from this evil.
[02:00:21.090 --> 02:00:25.289]  I don't think we're out of the woods yet.
[02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:30.270]  So we'll talk about the good and the bad and the ugly and look back at the campaign, what's going forward.
[02:00:30.609 --> 02:00:32.810]  I want to try to just give him the floor because he's polite.
[02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:35.130]  He'll shut up and let me talk, but I want to hear him talk.
[02:00:35.250 --> 02:00:41.750]  So Judge Joe Brown, I got a million questions, but first off, what's front and center on your radar and where do you want to go first?
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:50.640]  Remember all this talk we've had around about George Soros buying off these prosecutors that have been corrupting law and order in the cities?
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:01:06.510]  Well, he bought him one in San Francisco, then he paid for her to get elected to state attorney general, then U.S. senator, then I think some money helped out the Biden campaign, so she got picked as VP,
[02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:13.029]  and then he thought he had bought himself a president of the United States of America.
[02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:20.310]  So we had one of these prosecutorial prostitutes, I call them.
[02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:27.430]  I've run into a lot of them over the years, and they're some of the most corrupt people you'll ever run into in life.
[02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:29.189]  Not all of them, but most of them.
[02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:30.029]  They're on principle.
[02:01:31.939 --> 02:01:40.439]  We're just trying to win and they don't even know what they're winning for other than the fact that they're lost souls and they now have something to belong to.
[02:01:40.779 --> 02:01:52.479]  Whether you're talking about Letitia James, you're talking about Bragg, you're talking about Smith, you're talking about that clown who is the U.S. attorney up in New York, New York who will soon be replaced.
[02:01:53.559 --> 02:01:55.840]  It's the same, same old thing.
[02:01:56.079 --> 02:02:08.560]  They use the legal system not for promoting justice, equity, and fundamental fairness, but for what is now known as lawfare.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.939]  So that's the thing that we have to cope with right now.
[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:18.359]  And we are looking at what they did to you.
[02:02:18.479 --> 02:02:26.170]  They're basically trying to Yeah, we say silence your right to speak.
[02:02:26.489 --> 02:02:39.470]  And the way to counter speech that you don't like is by more convincing, reasonable, logical, rational, analytical, and concise speech to the contrary, if such can be found.
[02:02:40.449 --> 02:02:46.970]  But this thing that we have right now is an aspect of socialism that I do not like.
[02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:54.850]  And when we want to talk about what particular aspect of socialism, we have to go over Deutschland.
[02:02:55.449 --> 02:03:01.189]  Let's go back 90 years where we have Deutschland that had something called the Weimar Republic.
[02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:14.909]  That is no more because it got replaced by the National Socialist Workers' Party, the acronym for which on Deutsch, German, is Nazi.
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:24.539]  So we have Nazis going around today, and they are doing a typical Nazi saying, which is, accuse the other side of doing what you're doing.
[02:03:24.699 --> 02:03:28.720]  And they are accusing us of being the Nazis when they are the Nazis.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:44.840]  And by the way, just to throw stuff out we can discuss, I don't think there's going to be a civil war where you get states seceding from a union, but I do think there's going to be A lot of what we have called civil unrest.
[02:03:45.119 --> 02:03:56.760]  And that's going to be the George Floyd BLM stuff that went on over the last six, seven years ramped up exponentially and it's going to be a real life mess.
[02:03:57.079 --> 02:04:07.140]  And they expect everybody to roll over for the cupcakes that will be out there screeching as they're triggered about how horrible things are for them.
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:16.470]  Now, It's coming, and I'm predicting not necessarily the days after the election.
[02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:21.850]  I'm thinking more in terms of the beginning of the year when it really starts sinking in.
[02:04:21.949 --> 02:04:28.829]  And we're going to have a real live-esque show that's going to develop over California's Electoral College, folks.
[02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:37.989]  It's not going to be so much the House trying to reject the Electoral College count that puts Trump in office as it is so much what ought to be done with California.
[02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:54.449]  The Constitution leaves certain things up to the, well, Congress, and they've already spoken on how you're supposed to vote in a federal election, and they've made it illegal for illegals to vote in a federal election.
[02:04:54.630 --> 02:04:56.489]  They have to be citizens of the country.
[02:04:56.770 --> 02:05:11.619]  So California put in place through what is, uh, Trump called it, Nuscombe, And he signed in the law thing that says it's against the law in California to demand ID of a voter.
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.720]  So that means you cannot tell if a voter is in fact a legal...
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:24.859]  We're good to go.
[02:05:40.619 --> 02:05:48.439]  That they want to present in January is going to be null and void because you cannot determine the legality of its gathering.
[02:05:48.659 --> 02:05:51.699]  Now, a little brief something about electoral college.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  The United States is not modeled on a corporate model, but corporations are modeled on the United States government.
[02:06:01.939 --> 02:06:04.079]  Corporations are creatures of the state.
[02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:08.050]  And they are, in essence, fictitional persons.
[02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:10.470]  So how do you set up a corporation?
[02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:20.069]  Well, if you look at the United States' form of government, what you have is stockholders, and they are analogous to citizens.
[02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:26.770]  Well, the stockholders elect a board of directors.
[02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:31.069]  The citizens elect a board of electors.
[02:06:31.819 --> 02:06:35.739]  The Board of Directors chooses the Chief Executive Officer.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:42.760]  The Board of Electors selects the Chief Executive Officer.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:45.699]  He's known as the President of the United States.
[02:06:46.199 --> 02:06:48.359]  So that's why we have that.
[02:06:48.479 --> 02:06:55.300]  Now, if you look at the maps, you see all this huge expanse of red with just a few splotches of blue.
[02:06:55.479 --> 02:06:58.479]  Not blue states, but splotches of blue.
[02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:07.289]  That are contained within these states that have large population centers in relationship to a huge landmass that's red.
[02:07:07.449 --> 02:07:08.510]  You see it right there.
[02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:23.510]  Now, to prevent this from devolving into a civil war like we had in 1861, You have these rules to keep everything sort of on an even keel.
[02:07:23.729 --> 02:07:35.289]  You have two senators, no matter how big a state is, and you do recognize population by apportioning representatives in the House.
[02:07:36.829 --> 02:07:42.529]  To the various large population centers, but they're checks and balances on each other.
[02:07:42.869 --> 02:08:00.710]  And you see the Democratic Party, the blues, trying to evaporate those checks and balances by, say, getting rid of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate, which is designed to calm things down where the passions of the mob become too much in play.
[02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:13.310]  Where the Senate can check the House, but the House, because it does have a sufficient number of people to be worth listening to, they do have their influence.
[02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:15.670]  So we have that kind of thing.
[02:08:15.949 --> 02:08:19.670]  Now, the Electoral College is set up in this way.
[02:08:19.949 --> 02:08:23.949]  Let us fast forward to right now, and you can see the Euro Union.
[02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:28.569]  You see a union of sovereign nations.
[02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:33.010]  Nations is a word that's synonymous with state.
[02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:40.970]  So you see all of these sovereign states that have been fighting, going to war very violently over the last couple of thousand years.
[02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:42.630]  There's Greece.
[02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:46.390]  There's Italy, which was Rome.
[02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:47.529]  There's Germany.
[02:08:48.289 --> 02:08:50.829]  Which was where it was.
[02:08:51.010 --> 02:08:53.310]  There is France, which used to be Gaul.
[02:08:53.529 --> 02:08:55.310]  You find Switzerland.
[02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:58.189]  You find Turkey.
[02:08:58.750 --> 02:09:00.050]  You find Denmark.
[02:09:00.489 --> 02:09:03.189]  You find all of these countries in the Euro Union.
[02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:06.210]  We're good to go.
[02:09:23.609 --> 02:09:37.510]  That decided to join together in one collective, like the Euro Union, and another name for the United States of America, using political science terms, would properly be the United Nations of America.
[02:09:37.770 --> 02:09:49.770]  So when you've got these 50 sovereign entities all rolled up into a cooperative union, what you wind up with is individual entities.
[02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:54.050]  States still retaining a degree of their sovereignty.
[02:09:55.729 --> 02:10:00.170]  And we have a larger thing that they're part of.
[02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:10.670]  But you don't want Texas and Mississippi and Tennessee and Wyoming and Nebraska subject to just the popular vote.
[02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:20.369]  If we did that, most of us could stay home and the only people that needed to show up would be Los Angeles, San Francisco, That's right.
[02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:30.250]  I mean, the founders did create a genius system, as you're saying, all over the world, and now they're attacking that, because most people back then lived in the North, so then you wouldn't have any rights.
[02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:34.390]  You'd be slaves to the North or any other major population center if you were rural.
[02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.970]  It's really simple.
[02:10:34.989 --> 02:10:36.250]  So why do we see the assault?
[02:10:36.850 --> 02:10:51.609]  On the Electoral College, but doesn't Trump now winning the popular and the Electoral College and the trifecta of the legislative executive judicial, doesn't that basically just discredit any attempts to say he's illegitimate?
[02:10:51.949 --> 02:10:57.989]  Well, yes it does, but I'm not worried about his legitimacy since he is per se legitimate.
[02:10:57.989 --> 02:10:58.829]  He's there.
[02:10:59.029 --> 02:11:02.609]  The people have spoken overwhelmingly across the entire country.
[02:11:02.609 --> 02:11:03.770]  It was a landslide.
[02:11:04.090 --> 02:11:05.710]  It was a behind beating.
[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:10.329]  And if I was being impolite, I'd say something harsher about it.
[02:11:10.449 --> 02:11:12.369]  It was an old-time beatdown.
[02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:14.069]  She got her behind kicked.
[02:11:14.289 --> 02:11:17.409]  So what we're looking at is something else.
[02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:23.130]  This is an opportunity for us to wind back all of that false garbage.
[02:11:23.130 --> 02:11:28.109]  And they are so prone to talk about misinformation, malinformation, disinformation.
[02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:29.310]  They're spreading it.
[02:11:29.369 --> 02:11:29.930]  It's a lie.
[02:11:30.289 --> 02:11:34.250]  What they're talking about is not what our system is supposed to be about.
[02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:39.510]  It is a carefully crafted instrument of balance and proportion.
[02:11:40.489 --> 02:11:56.710]  So what I am saying is that one of the things we don't want is another 1861 to 1865, because translating that into modern terminology, if we had the casualty rate that we had in the Civil War,
[02:11:56.909 --> 02:12:02.010]  our Civil War, it just happens to exceed by a factor of two.
[02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:19.880]  All of the rest of the casualty counts Of every other war the United States has been in, one, two, Korea, Vietnam, etc., if you roll them all in to run and multiply them by two, you just now get to the casualty toll in the Civil War.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:30.500]  And if we had that casualty toll, we would have between six and about nine and a half million people in the United States that wouldn't be Doing too well.
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:31.560]  They'd be casualties.
[02:12:31.979 --> 02:12:33.319]  So we don't want that.
[02:12:33.319 --> 02:12:34.960]  So we try to prevent it.
[02:12:35.039 --> 02:12:45.939]  And what we have is some people who are selfishly about their cult, who wish to dismantle the system outside of what the system can do to protect it.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:47.000]  And I know where you're going with this.
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:48.220]  You're giving us a great dissertation, Judge.
[02:12:48.319 --> 02:12:48.880]  And please continue.
[02:12:49.039 --> 02:12:49.680]  You're a great historian.
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.720]  I love having dinner with you as well.
[02:12:50.779 --> 02:12:51.500]  You know so much.
[02:12:52.199 --> 02:12:54.359]  I like that too, too.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.920]  By the time we've got here, explain to people what you're saying is the left, the establishment, knows they're losing.
[02:13:01.079 --> 02:13:02.079]  They're planning something dirty.
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:06.239]  Carville says have a violent uprising if Trump got elected.
[02:13:06.239 --> 02:13:09.119]  He said that three weeks ago because he's coming to kill the black men.
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:12.060]  We see Raskin promising to stir up stuff.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.520]  We know they're creeping around.
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:16.520]  So obviously, I don't think they're going to completely give up.
[02:13:16.619 --> 02:13:17.220]  And you're right.
[02:13:17.359 --> 02:13:19.659]  They're all betting on civil unrest once he's in.
[02:13:20.119 --> 02:13:27.279]  They've introduced a bill, Senator Blumenthal, to take the power of the domestic military from the president, which would be a legislative coup against the executive.
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:30.939]  They're definitely setting something up around civil unrest.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  We know that.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:32.859]  You're getting at that.
[02:13:33.079 --> 02:13:36.260]  What are they planning, do you think, with your understanding of history?
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:38.020]  And how do we counter it?
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:47.460]  Department of Defense Directive 5240.01 signed into law this September 27th.
[02:13:47.779 --> 02:13:49.500]  Now, what does it say?
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:57.800]  It further refines the authorization of the Department of Defense to use deadly force against civilians.
[02:13:58.159 --> 02:14:12.140]  And two of the categories, though they fudge about it, that are interesting are Discontent, refusal to abide by COVID-19 directives.
[02:14:12.539 --> 02:14:21.000]  And another one is dealing with rejection or opposition to election outcomes.
[02:14:21.359 --> 02:14:32.789]  So at the time they signed this into law under the Biden administration this past September, two months ago, Not quite two months ago.
[02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:43.689]  They anticipated that they were going to win and that they were going to have an excuse to claim insurrection and other stuff and pull off effectively a modern-day Kent state.
[02:14:44.619 --> 02:14:54.739]  Those who aren't familiar with it, that's when the National Guard gunned down some students on Ohio State's campus, Kent State campus, and it was ugly.
[02:14:55.159 --> 02:14:57.500]  I was a grown man when that happened.
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:58.800]  I well remember it.
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:04.880]  So what is going on is they were anticipating something.
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:15.140]  But when you do this kind of thing and you violate the law or the precepts of the law, What you also do is set in place something that can be used against you.
[02:15:15.579 --> 02:15:25.840]  And people who are narrow-minded, selfish, and unlettered, unlearned, and ignorant, and emotional fail to understand these things about America.
[02:15:26.039 --> 02:15:38.119]  We do things and accept collateral damage consequences because there are more important things that are at risk, and those things have to be preserved so we do not set up a negative precedent.
[02:15:38.739 --> 02:15:40.680]  What do I mean about collateral damage?
[02:15:40.979 --> 02:15:47.100]  Well, we find the convenience of driving on a freeway at 65, 70 miles an hour to be a great convenience.
[02:15:47.279 --> 02:15:49.199]  But there's collateral damage.
[02:15:49.199 --> 02:15:51.460]  It's called injury, mutilation.
[02:15:51.779 --> 02:15:53.159]  It's called death.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.500]  And destruction.
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:57.979]  With freedom comes cost, and we accept that to not be an anti-state.
[02:15:58.079 --> 02:15:59.619]  There it is, right there.
[02:16:00.039 --> 02:16:01.279]  Long story short.
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.500]  So, we have these things, that's like the Second Amendment.
[02:16:04.659 --> 02:16:06.020]  Why do we have the Second Amendment?
[02:16:06.159 --> 02:16:19.500]  Because we don't need the government to give us an absolute assurance that our day-to-day Community, community, door-to-door peace will be in somebody else's hands.
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:27.119]  We can have that ability to bestow public peace, self-defense, defense of family and principle.
[02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:29.859]  We can have that in our own hands.
[02:16:29.859 --> 02:16:34.829]  And if the military gets out of check, if the government gets out of check, Guess what?
[02:16:34.989 --> 02:16:39.950]  The Second Amendment says there's an ultimate balance, a check in this whole thing.
[02:16:40.110 --> 02:17:03.340]  It is not just the legislative body against the executive body against the judicial body against the That's right.
[02:17:03.479 --> 02:17:05.860]  So going back, Judge, this is so important.
[02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:13.110]  The Democrats put civil unrest, martial law clauses in, constantly said Trump was doing it.
[02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:15.250]  Now that's still in place.
[02:17:15.389 --> 02:17:24.750]  Then they tried to bring in legislation that's sitting there waiting to strip him of that power, but now they're in a paradox where they put the power there, but then wanted to strip Trump.
[02:17:24.969 --> 02:17:34.489]  So clearly they were planning something with Trump losing, but then they're also planning, they're saying civil unrest, once he gets in, try to make him look like a dictator.
[02:17:34.649 --> 02:17:35.850]  How do we thread that needle?
[02:17:35.909 --> 02:17:36.850]  What do you think they're going to pull?
[02:17:37.639 --> 02:17:42.860]  I think they were already planning it, but they got awarded because Trump was right.
[02:17:43.159 --> 02:17:44.139]  Too big to rig.
[02:17:45.079 --> 02:17:46.159]  That's the phrase.
[02:17:46.639 --> 02:18:01.670]  What I saw was something in all of the The televised coverage of these elections, which the first one I was looking at was way back in 1960 when Nixon and Kennedy went at it.
[02:18:01.809 --> 02:18:04.649]  I had an assignment for a social studies class.
[02:18:04.649 --> 02:18:15.229]  I was a freshman in high school and I had to write a report upon this and we were instructed, pursuant to that class, to watch what was going on on election night.
[02:18:15.610 --> 02:18:22.969]  I have never seen them take as long as they did this time to declare a winner in certain states.
[02:18:22.969 --> 02:18:25.209]  You saw what they did in Georgia.
[02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:27.389]  Just hours that stayed stagnant.
[02:18:27.510 --> 02:18:28.629]  Now, what is going on?
[02:18:28.909 --> 02:18:41.930]  That, to me, in my major, declared major, was political science at UCLA. That says to me that mainstream media, legacy media, as Mr.
[02:18:42.049 --> 02:18:56.940]  Musk calls it, Was in league with the Democratic Party, and they had certain information, but they didn't have all of it, and they were seeing whether or not the Democratic Party was going to come up with a cheat, which they would have gone along with.
[02:18:57.139 --> 02:19:01.579]  You remember last time, next to last, when it looked like Mr.
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:13.260]  Trump was leading when we all went to bed, and then we woke up a few hours later, and these very small percentages that hadn't reported all of a sudden flipped over, and now Biden is winning.
[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:16.569]  You see, that looked very nasty.
[02:19:16.569 --> 02:19:26.209]  So I imagine that what we have is a mainstream media that has learned a little bit over the last four years, though that's a long attention span for them.
[02:19:26.909 --> 02:19:29.110]  They said, we'll just hold off.
[02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:34.850]  We won't make any predictions and let's see what happens, if there are any avenues for them to cheat.
[02:19:35.010 --> 02:19:39.850]  And I do firmly declare that they cheated the last time.
[02:19:39.989 --> 02:19:40.430]  Absolutely.
[02:19:41.529 --> 02:19:51.909]  Over my professional career, I have been involved over the last 50 years in several gross and obvious election cheats that got thwarted.
[02:19:52.149 --> 02:19:55.530]  I won't go into them, but let's just put it this way.
[02:19:55.729 --> 02:20:06.530]  Most recently, January 2021, you had a report from the U.S. Department of Justice that there were no significant discrepancies in this last election cycle they had.
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:08.360]  For president.
[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:15.579]  But they had been giving out reports on Memphis slash Shelby County since 2006.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:25.700]  And in 2008, they put the money up to replace all of the so-called deballed voting machines that we had here that were discovered to be hopelessly corrupted.
[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:51.729]  Now, it issued a report in January of We certainly don't claim to be doctors,

[02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:01.489]  And he must be reading my mind like telekinesis.
[02:22:01.569 --> 02:22:03.090]  No, we're just very similar people.
[02:22:03.229 --> 02:22:04.610]  We love freedom and we study history.
[02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:07.729]  And gosh, you can't get us apart at dinner.
[02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:12.530]  Judge Joe Brown is loving to death because it's refreshing when somebody knows more than you.
[02:22:12.709 --> 02:22:13.590]  I mean, this guy knows.
[02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:16.110]  Because I've read a lot of history books, experienced a lot.
[02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:18.110]  You can definitely sit this guy's feet all day.
[02:22:18.430 --> 02:22:19.489]  And we were just talking.
[02:22:21.569 --> 02:22:22.989]  We're going to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:29.559]  We're going to add more shows, whether they shut down InfoWars today, We come back even stronger.
[02:22:29.719 --> 02:22:32.920]  And maybe we'll have a Judge Joe Brown on the Alex Jones Network.
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:34.959]  Maybe we'll have a Laura Logan.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:42.860]  Maybe we'll team up with a bunch of other heavy hitters and go 24 hours a day and see how the New World Order likes that.
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:44.799]  So stay tuned for a lot of things.
[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:47.700]  But Judge, you got cut off by the break, a hard break with the satellites.
[02:22:48.559 --> 02:22:52.540]  And I've heard you tell the story before on other shows, but I'm glad you're telling it now because I follow you.
[02:22:52.739 --> 02:22:54.059]  I don't think you've told this on my show.
[02:22:55.079 --> 02:22:57.700]  Here they are saying there's no fraud, the FBI, 2021.
[02:22:58.459 --> 02:23:00.340]  But none of the judges ever looked at it.
[02:23:00.399 --> 02:23:03.379]  They just said no standing, as you know, but the folks might not understand what that means.
[02:23:03.719 --> 02:23:09.399]  But then the last four years, the RNC, under Trump's partial control, now he has full control, went and proved it.
[02:23:09.459 --> 02:23:10.159]  It's all come out.
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.479]  We had all these federal judges say illegals can vote.
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.639]  Then you had the Supreme Court slap it down in Virginia.
[02:23:14.639 --> 02:23:17.059]  So really, the naivete is ending.
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:22.920]  And now we're catching them red-handed everywhere, but your point is, I've heard the story, it's all still a thunder, but you can still tell it.
[02:23:23.559 --> 02:23:31.139]  Here they have certified fraud in Memphis, admitted, but then they're separately saying no fraud in America, but then we had all these other confirmed cases.
[02:23:31.139 --> 02:23:38.659]  So they lied to the people, just like under Biden, they hid all the murder statistics that claim murder had gone down, and more asinine crap.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:41.079]  So briefly tell that story, but then everybody wants...
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:49.079]  The 35,000 foot view from you about this mandate, what this does, the establishment, how big this is.
[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:57.659]  As you know, there's a global realignment of populism happening and how we make sure that this route that we have against evil accelerates and continues.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:59.020]  So Judge Joe Brown, please continue.
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:20.420]  Okay, basically all I was going to say is right after they said there were no discrepancies in the selection process, not this one, but the last one in 2020, November 2020, they turned right around a few days later and said once again there was absolute corruption in Memphis and the vote count was not reliable because of the hacked machines.
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:21.940]  They've since replaced them.
[02:24:22.559 --> 02:24:27.299]  But I just got through talking to a gentleman who the state hired to look into the situation.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:32.299]  Tennessee is essentially red, except for a blue enclave down here in Memphis.
[02:24:32.559 --> 02:24:43.040]  And they sent somebody down, and he took the machines they have now, he took three minutes on a demonstration to hack the things and capture the whole system as a demonstration.
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:45.500]  So that isn't a very strong setup.
[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:56.040]  We had a bomb squad we were looking at, and we did not realize that they were disarming a huge bomb.
[02:24:56.239 --> 02:24:57.020]  What is that?
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.040]  What is the point behind these illegals?
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:13.360]  Well, aside from it being felonious, a conspiracy, everybody is likely guilty of a federal conspiracy to harbor in fugitives and give aid and comfort if they set up a sanctuary situation.
[02:25:13.799 --> 02:25:15.840]  What did we actually look at?
[02:25:16.409 --> 02:25:29.870]  The President of the United States is the chief diplomatic officer, and the way the Constitution is written, it gives a lot of authority on citizenship and voting to the states and Congress.
[02:25:30.430 --> 02:25:51.799]  What we have is an opportunity, had Harris Waltz gotten in, We're good to go.
[02:25:59.909 --> 02:26:03.790]  What happens is that you no longer have to wait in line.
[02:26:03.790 --> 02:26:06.790]  You don't have to pass the test, go through the instructions.
[02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:10.010]  You automatically become a citizen after five years.
[02:26:10.170 --> 02:26:14.149]  Now you notice where they've been shipping them off to.
[02:26:14.729 --> 02:26:23.590]  What we have been calling the battleground states that Kamala still got her butt whipped in, but that's where they were sending them.
[02:26:23.829 --> 02:26:47.450]  So what would have happened is when we get to 2026, which is the start of the midterm elections for the next cycle, You would have had all of these people who would have automatically become citizens in these battleground states and were given Democratic Party types and absolute dominance in the proceedings when it came to the House and some seats in the Senate.
[02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:51.090]  Now, was that going to happen?
[02:26:51.250 --> 02:27:01.870]  Well, they certainly looked like they were going to try it, and that's why I think Well, not so much shipping, but they were being so nice to these illegals, and that's all you can say.
[02:27:01.989 --> 02:27:03.530]  I won't use the term migrant.
[02:27:04.209 --> 02:27:17.680]  A migrant is when somebody with authority, authorization, Invitation goes from point A to point B. If you don't have that and you're illegal, you're an invader.
[02:27:17.879 --> 02:27:25.799]  So we had all of these invaders that somebody had a bright idea would make into automatic citizens, which would give the Democratic Party a hit.
[02:27:26.329 --> 02:27:29.329]  A hedgeman in the process that they certainly don't deserve.
[02:27:29.729 --> 02:27:32.190]  So they were planning to capture the country with replacement migration.
[02:27:32.409 --> 02:27:34.750]  So what is the mandate Trump has?
[02:27:34.850 --> 02:27:36.350]  What do you expect the establishment to do?
[02:27:37.049 --> 02:27:47.329]  Under the law, as it exists right now, he can send them back because this would not have worked but with one caveat, and that was had Harris-Waltz gotten the trophy.
[02:27:47.969 --> 02:28:08.329]  Harris would have been able to issue a blanket pardon We're good to go.
[02:28:14.579 --> 02:28:16.520]  I think?
[02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:41.750]  By the midterms, where they could assume a heavy voting power by bringing in 35, 40 million people.
[02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:46.229]  Sure, so their plan to finally break the country has been defeated or postponed for now.
[02:28:47.129 --> 02:28:49.170]  People call it- Trump has done that.
[02:28:49.629 --> 02:28:51.530]  And see, here's the thing about Mr.
[02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.930]  Trump.
[02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:52.489]  Mr.
[02:28:52.709 --> 02:28:57.750]  Trump represents something that has not happened in American politics in a long time.
[02:28:58.010 --> 02:29:00.430]  He is leadership.
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:09.000]  It's like 95% of America, like 95% of the world, they're type 1 thinkers.
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:16.879]  Don't ask me to explain, but essentially what that means is they want somebody that they can look at as saying, that's the great leader.
[02:29:17.059 --> 02:29:19.959]  He will take things in hand and he'll make it all right.
[02:29:20.219 --> 02:29:23.680]  But we haven't had anybody like that in a long, long time.
[02:29:24.139 --> 02:29:24.659]  So...
[02:29:26.879 --> 02:29:38.879]  What we wind up with is somebody, Donald Trump, who has captured America's mind in terms of this guy is somebody that we can deal with.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:39.700]  This is daddy.
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:41.079]  This is granddaddy.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.579]  This is uncle.
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:43.799]  This is great uncle.
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:49.639]  This is the person that we need to benevolently get it together for us.
[02:29:49.840 --> 02:30:07.280]  There are a lot of people who've been taking advantage of the situation who won't anymore and they hate it and they're pushing all the envelopes to try and discredit this man and create a mess and try to defeat the will of the public.
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:08.520]  Now what's going on?
[02:30:09.979 --> 02:30:14.399]  How many times have you seen a crosswalk painted in red or rainbow colors?
[02:30:14.659 --> 02:30:17.100]  That's defacement of public property.
[02:30:17.299 --> 02:30:18.479]  A sidewalk?
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:24.200]  Seen rainbow colors up and down your child's school hallway?
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:28.399]  That's a gang.
[02:30:28.399 --> 02:30:30.459]  That's a foreign army marking its territory.
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:46.059]  There's another thing to it.
[02:30:46.239 --> 02:30:51.059]  A religion doesn't necessarily have to have a god, and if you don't get it, think Buddhism.
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:55.979]  Buddhism is an ancient and honorable religion that presses a philosophy.
[02:30:55.979 --> 02:30:59.379]  You can have a god, but you don't have to have one to be a Buddhist.
[02:31:00.020 --> 02:31:04.719]  A Confucianist either, or a Taoist, or any of the above.
[02:31:05.059 --> 02:31:06.840]  They're systems of philosophy.
[02:31:07.139 --> 02:31:23.120]  And the rainbow, and I'm not talking about gay folk per se, I'm just talking about the rainbow that pimps off of them like they also do off of black people, brown people, yellow people, red people, white people,
[02:31:23.219 --> 02:31:23.680]  everybody.
[02:31:23.719 --> 02:31:25.200]  They're just parasites.
[02:31:25.579 --> 02:31:29.100]  They have something unique in human history, which is this.
[02:31:29.649 --> 02:31:48.329]  Every other philosophy, whether it is pagan, monotheistic, whether it has a god or not, it attempts to impose what we have called good character on the people that are subject to following the particular faith or philosophy.
[02:31:48.770 --> 02:32:05.969]  In other words, good character being those things that are nigh universal all across the planet Earth throughout all times, bravery, courage, Being somebody that's about making where you live a better, safer, more secure place filled with economic prosperity,
[02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:08.610]  sense of purpose, morality, ethics.
[02:32:09.350 --> 02:32:15.930]  Being men and women of public peace, dignity, and order who can be brave when necessary and violent if appropriate.
[02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:21.450]  Where you set up a sense of purpose, worth, attitude that is good.
[02:32:22.250 --> 02:32:23.770]  So, Judge, we're almost out of time.
[02:32:23.889 --> 02:32:25.270]  I can get you on for hours soon.
[02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:28.049]  I'll speed this up.
[02:32:28.149 --> 02:32:39.450]  In other words, what we have is a culture that hates itself, and they're attempting to impose that self-hate, self-disdain on the whole country and wipe out all morality and ethics.
[02:32:39.979 --> 02:32:41.920]  And that's what we're really facing.
[02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.040]  It's not politics as usual.
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:57.860]  It's the attempt of a religion to officially install itself quite against the Constitution of the United States and impose its very bad, syphilitic, corrupt will on all of the people.
[02:32:57.860 --> 02:33:13.180]  So we had somebody that we could be galvanized by to say, When they weren't really paying attention until they paid attention,
[02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:17.639]  that song that wouldn't go away and they were surprised to discover it was Mr.
[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:20.479]  Trump after they'd been conditioned to be against it.
[02:33:20.940 --> 02:33:23.159]  So we listened to our inner selves.
[02:33:23.159 --> 02:33:26.780]  We relied upon the strength we have as a Republican.
[02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:30.379]  We said, hell no, this mess has got to go.
[02:33:30.559 --> 02:33:40.559]  And the Democratic Party has been thrown out, and we have another ideal opportunity, which is a president of the United States who will be a strong president again.
[02:33:40.559 --> 02:33:42.219]  I 100% agree with you.
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:48.639]  We have even the corporate media saying they're dead, they were dead before, but by dead no one has a brain believes them.
[02:33:48.819 --> 02:33:56.239]  What do you expect the whole globalist BlackRock thing that created this leftist religion to overthrow Western culture to make us weak in their own words?
[02:33:56.459 --> 02:34:06.579]  What do you expect them to do now as I'm seeing signs that they realize that the more they push back, the more we push back, and I'm seeing real signs that they've had their will broken.
[02:34:06.579 --> 02:34:10.280]  I'm not saying they're defeated yet, but I mean I'm seeing really good signs.
[02:34:11.239 --> 02:34:13.040]  Well, let's put it this way.
[02:34:13.219 --> 02:34:21.100]  You give this type a prompting and they'll destroy themselves because they're not logical, reasonable, rational, analytical.
[02:34:21.139 --> 02:34:25.379]  They're overly emotional and they go off of their feelings.
[02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:31.860]  And oftentimes the best thing to do under a tense circumstance is control your feelings and focus.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:32.600]  They won't.
[02:34:32.899 --> 02:34:35.200]  So let them go get provoked.
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:36.440]  Let them get triggered.
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:38.959]  Let them go establish their rages.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:40.739]  Let them do what they want to do.
[02:34:42.290 --> 02:34:48.129]  I pointed out to somebody, I said, hey, you know, there are more Kyle Rittenhouse types out there.
[02:34:48.290 --> 02:34:52.290]  Beware what you set up when you start trying to set up a mob situation.
[02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:56.790]  You might mess with the wrong people, and you guys are for gun control.
[02:34:56.989 --> 02:34:57.989]  We aren't.
[02:34:58.049 --> 02:35:01.629]  So, just keep the perspective handy.
[02:35:02.530 --> 02:35:03.670]  I've got to get this in here.
[02:35:03.770 --> 02:35:05.350]  What do you make of the B4 movement?
[02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:07.030]  What do you make of the B4 movement?
[02:35:07.149 --> 02:35:15.909]  Women shaving their heads because they're going to be put in concentration camps everywhere, saying they're going to poison their husbands and boyfriends, even if they didn't vote for Trump, and that men all need to be killed.
[02:35:16.049 --> 02:35:17.069]  I mean, these are...
[02:35:17.069 --> 02:35:19.290]  This isn't just isolated lunatics.
[02:35:19.469 --> 02:35:19.930]  This is...
[02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:23.829]  The Democratic Party is embracing women going into full psychotic breaks.
[02:35:24.350 --> 02:35:25.270]  What's happening there?
[02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:29.629]  That's the counterpart to incel, but it's typical.
[02:35:29.909 --> 02:35:30.610]  They are...
[02:35:32.559 --> 02:35:35.020]  It's secondary in their embrace of the idea.
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:40.420]  It's sick, and any time you back off and think about it, I'll tell you a joke.
[02:35:40.559 --> 02:35:44.959]  When you look at me, when I look at you, when you look at any person, what are you looking at?
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:45.879]  Any human.
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:46.940]  What are you looking at?
[02:35:47.329 --> 02:35:51.770]  You're looking at a successful, and I'll be polite about it, a successful screw.
[02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:55.950]  And that screw popped out after nine months.
[02:35:56.049 --> 02:35:56.729]  It grew up.
[02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:58.250]  It had a successful screw.
[02:35:58.510 --> 02:36:04.030]  Something else popped out in those of the generations of humankind leading from day one to now.
[02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:17.850]  So if they want to get in the way of that, there's another mama, big mama, I call her mother nature, who will smack somebody down and step on them and squish them to like they're a squash broach.
[02:36:18.209 --> 02:36:23.430]  And that's where they're putting themselves because that's not as per the human race.
[02:36:23.649 --> 02:36:26.590]  So they're way out of line and they will not win.
[02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:28.790]  And good riddance.
[02:36:29.069 --> 02:36:40.229]  At least if they take themselves out, the boys, the young boys, Young adolescents who are growing up, they won't have cause to waste their time on a dead end.
[02:36:40.699 --> 02:36:42.700]  Well, Judge Joe Brown, you nailed it again.
[02:36:43.459 --> 02:36:45.079]  The globalists are wanting to play God.
[02:36:45.219 --> 02:36:47.299]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, they want to control human biology.
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:48.139]  They want to depopulate us.
[02:36:48.219 --> 02:36:49.059]  They took on Mother Nature.
[02:36:49.799 --> 02:36:52.200]  Humanity is aligned with God that created Mother Nature.
[02:36:52.639 --> 02:36:53.840]  We're coming back to our humanity.
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:55.239]  We are going to win.
[02:36:55.879 --> 02:36:58.340]  People should follow you on X at JudgeJoeBrownTV.
[02:36:58.739 --> 02:37:03.819]  Visit your amazing website and find all your great shows and material at TheJudgeJoeBrownShow.com.
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:04.680]  Let's talk soon.
[02:37:04.739 --> 02:37:05.319]  God bless you, sir.
[02:37:06.079 --> 02:37:07.540]  Yeah, and put me to work.
[02:37:08.379 --> 02:37:09.159]  I'm bored.
[02:37:10.659 --> 02:37:11.520]  I want to talk to you, brother.
[02:37:11.639 --> 02:37:12.139]  Let's talk soon.
[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:17.760]  You know, I wonder why he wasn't calling me and I've been calling him.
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:19.659]  His phone got corrupted.
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:20.360]  He lost my number.
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:22.200]  So we're going to get back working together.
[02:37:22.319 --> 02:37:22.479]  All right.
[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:25.020]  I just got massive breaking news while he was talking.
[02:37:26.479 --> 02:37:28.340]  We're connecting Roger Stone right now.
[02:37:30.159 --> 02:37:32.540]  This is exclusive information, Roger said.
[02:37:32.559 --> 02:37:34.799]  This is not broken yet.
[02:37:36.399 --> 02:37:36.760]  And...
[02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:43.809]  The crew was just talking to Roger on the phone.
[02:37:43.950 --> 02:37:44.809]  They're connecting right now.
[02:37:45.010 --> 02:37:45.750]  He's on the road.
[02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:51.610]  So I'm not going to mention this until I'm sure I'm supposed to be able to talk about this, but I was just told we're going to break this.
[02:37:51.729 --> 02:37:53.409]  So this is big news.
[02:37:54.049 --> 02:37:56.030]  This might be breaking any minute here.
[02:37:57.309 --> 02:38:00.790]  I'm going to wait and see if Trump wants this out yet until we talk to Roger live on air.
[02:38:00.850 --> 02:38:04.510]  While we're connecting him, I've been so hot on the news, folks.
[02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:05.870]  I haven't really plugged today.
[02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:08.170]  Without your funds, it doesn't matter what happens.
[02:38:08.290 --> 02:38:09.450]  Infowars will shut down.
[02:38:09.549 --> 02:38:12.469]  We've got funds to launch the new show and new system.
[02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:14.370]  We're trying to finish the bigger studio.
[02:38:15.010 --> 02:38:20.469]  And we've got the satellite uplinks, the bandwidth, just the servers, the legal, all that.
[02:38:20.850 --> 02:38:22.709]  We want to launch the Alex Jones Network.
[02:38:23.559 --> 02:38:24.899]  And we've got all these great people.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.579]  We want to go 24 hours a day.
[02:38:26.819 --> 02:38:28.899]  Regardless if InfoWars survives or not, this is happening.
[02:38:29.159 --> 02:38:32.180]  If you support it, we build it, you will come.
[02:38:32.299 --> 02:38:33.280]  Well, we need your support.
[02:38:33.399 --> 02:38:38.379]  So we've got incredible t-shirts, incredible supplements, incredible products at thealexshowstore.com that's separate from InfoWars.
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:40.559]  And this new shirt, I love it.
[02:38:41.239 --> 02:38:42.180]  I came up with the idea.
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:47.000]  And it's got, if you're a radio listener, a map of the U.S. with a 2024 win.
[02:38:47.219 --> 02:38:48.420]  It's almost all red.
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:51.219]  It says, Trump, better coverage than Verizon.
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:53.299]  Can you hear us now?
[02:38:53.739 --> 02:38:58.700]  A great shirt to spread the word, to have fun, and fund the Infowar.
[02:38:58.799 --> 02:39:02.299]  Made right there in Arkansas, where the great folks at the Alex Schoen Store are based.
[02:39:03.139 --> 02:39:04.379]  TheAlexSchoenStore.com.

[02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:40.370]  We're out of the gummies, but this is twice as strong as the gummies.
[02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:42.209]  The gummies are coming in soon.
[02:39:42.450 --> 02:39:43.530]  That's the main seller.
[02:39:43.729 --> 02:39:44.489]  People are smart.
[02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:46.049]  They're doing their own research.
[02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:53.010]  If you're a listener and want to support the broadcast, get something great in the mail, this is a private label of one of the top-rated CMOSes.

[02:39:55.930 --> 02:39:57.909]  Because we go out and get whatever's already the highest rate and the best.
[02:39:57.969 --> 02:39:58.950]  They let us private label it.
[02:39:59.250 --> 02:39:59.530]  Boom.

[02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:12.569]  There are three limited edition fundraiser posters.
[02:40:13.069 --> 02:40:14.870]  So there's some good markup in those.
[02:40:15.049 --> 02:40:17.209]  If you want to really support us, we actually get some funds in.
[02:40:17.809 --> 02:40:30.790]  There's not much markup in the supplements or the clothing and stuff, but when you get one of the back-to-back-to-back Trump posters or the InfoWars, Alex Jones, Star Wars-esque poster, those are limited edition and will help keep us on the air, whatever happens to InfoWars today.
[02:40:31.229 --> 02:40:31.909]  Everybody's calling me.
[02:40:31.969 --> 02:40:32.629]  My phone's blowing up.
[02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:34.290]  Hey, you said the auction's over at 10.30.
[02:40:34.450 --> 02:40:35.409]  They didn't have an auction.
[02:40:35.489 --> 02:40:41.930]  They decided two days ago, oh, just sealed bids, one thing, whoever's the biggest gets it, but we reserve the right to give it to whoever we want or whatever.
[02:40:42.049 --> 02:40:44.829]  I don't know what's going to happen to this building.
[02:40:44.829 --> 02:40:49.969]  We could be shut down As soon as this information comes in, that's a whole other story in and of itself.
[02:40:50.110 --> 02:40:51.489]  We're getting Roger on the line right now.
[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:57.049]  But I want to play that InfoWars Lives Forever clip while I figure out what's going on here.
[02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:58.610]  And then we'll come out with Roger Stone.
[02:40:58.709 --> 02:40:59.069]  Here it is.
[02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:08.149]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[02:41:08.430 --> 02:41:12.930]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:19.829]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[02:41:19.930 --> 02:41:23.069]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[02:41:23.270 --> 02:41:25.709]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[02:41:25.950 --> 02:41:28.690]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:41:28.909 --> 02:41:32.409]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[02:41:32.889 --> 02:41:39.770]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[02:41:40.049 --> 02:41:43.190]  They have declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:52.209]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[02:41:53.149 --> 02:41:56.350]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[02:41:56.549 --> 02:42:03.049]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJN Live on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[02:42:03.329 --> 02:42:06.950]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[02:42:07.170 --> 02:42:11.350]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJN Live.

[02:43:18.959 --> 02:43:19.420]  All right.
[02:43:19.979 --> 02:43:21.020]  This is wild.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:23.020]  I'm told we're breaking this.
[02:43:23.379 --> 02:43:24.920]  We're going to break in two minutes.
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:28.000]  Roger's about to give a big speech, but he is going to give us the exclusive.
[02:43:28.159 --> 02:43:29.399]  Trump just gave him the exclusive.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:32.879]  So this is really good news.
[02:43:33.059 --> 02:43:34.040]  This is amazing.
[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:41.020]  He'll be with us about 20 minutes in the next hour as well to cover the waterfront on all the election fraud that's coming out and other key intel.
[02:43:42.059 --> 02:43:42.459]  So...
[02:43:43.549 --> 02:43:45.930]  Roger's been given by the President just minutes ago.
[02:43:45.930 --> 02:43:47.670]  He was already on about the election fraud.
[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:48.850]  This exclusive.
[02:43:49.469 --> 02:43:51.389]  So, Roger, you want to do this now?
[02:43:51.489 --> 02:43:53.170]  We're going to break and come back and do it in a couple minutes.
[02:43:54.569 --> 02:43:56.850]  Let's go to break and come back and do it in a couple minutes.
[02:43:57.430 --> 02:44:00.110]  Yeah, this is big.
[02:44:00.129 --> 02:44:03.489]  And that's the kind of stuff Trump does with his friends as he gives them these big exclusives.
[02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:06.370]  And we're friends with Roger, so we're getting this here.
[02:44:06.430 --> 02:44:07.409]  This is some really good news.
[02:44:07.469 --> 02:44:07.950]  Very exciting.
[02:44:08.370 --> 02:44:09.569]  Has to do with Tulsi Gabbards.
[02:44:09.610 --> 02:44:10.250]  We'll leave it at that.
[02:44:11.290 --> 02:44:12.430]  You're really good friends with her.
[02:44:12.489 --> 02:44:13.110]  She's an amazing lady.
[02:44:13.229 --> 02:44:13.889]  I'm jealous of you.
[02:44:14.809 --> 02:44:19.409]  Roger, separately, though, they are trying to steal that Senate seat, aren't they?
[02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:20.549]  That's why you originally were coming on.
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:29.079]  Yeah, they're trying, but I spoke to one of the top advisors, to Republican Dave McCormick, Jim Schultz, old friend of mine.
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:44.159]  He assures me that in the end, it's not really possible that even with these new 20,000 ballots that have appeared out of nowhere, That still puts Dave McCormick 29,000 votes ahead.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:45:00.180]  He is, despite the antics of the Democrat machine in Pennsylvania, where these 20,000 votes appeared out of nowhere, and 99% of them are for the Democrat candidate for the Senate.
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:05.620]  That still leaves Dave McCormick 29,000 votes ahead.
[02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:10.700]  Additive to the Republican majority in the Senate.
[02:45:12.819 --> 02:45:14.100]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:15.200]  All right, Roger.
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.120]  Stonezone.com.
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:22.680]  We'll also look at clearly the stolen seat there in Wisconsin.
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:24.120]  That's now all coming out.
[02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:29.280]  Elon Musk on the full warpath with his Government Efficiency Bureau.
[02:45:29.659 --> 02:45:31.620]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[02:45:32.449 --> 02:45:37.229]  With Roger Stone, with massive, breaking good news.
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:40.530]  I can tell you right now, look at that smile.
[02:45:40.770 --> 02:45:43.549]  The swamp is not going to be happy about this.
[02:45:43.729 --> 02:45:48.309]  And that kind of balances out the bad news of what they just did in the U.S. Senate, but that's no fault of Trump.
[02:45:49.290 --> 02:45:52.870]  The great Roger Stone, StoneZone.com, back in two minutes.
[02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:55.569]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:58.709]  And we've got the best designs at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:45:58.809 --> 02:46:01.030]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:01.329 --> 02:46:02.829]  You exercise your free speech.
[02:46:03.010 --> 02:46:04.750]  You stand up to the bullies.
[02:46:06.850 --> 02:46:09.090]  You exercise your will.
[02:46:10.290 --> 02:46:15.209]  And it keeps this broadcast, if we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[02:46:16.170 --> 02:46:19.569]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[02:46:19.569 --> 02:46:20.590]  It's all set up.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:29.819]  The crew, the studios, all of it, but we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[02:46:31.129 --> 02:46:35.229]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[02:46:36.090 --> 02:46:43.610]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.

[02:47:58.219 --> 02:48:05.360]  There's Trump earlier today arriving triumphantly in D.C. Biden congratulating and promising peaceful transfer, which makes me nervous.
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:09.159]  Roger was already popping in to cover some of the latest election news.
[02:48:09.239 --> 02:48:10.260]  They're still trying to steal...
[02:48:20.699 --> 02:48:23.639]  Great news concerning the country, draining the swamp.
[02:48:23.799 --> 02:48:26.180]  Tulsi Gabbard, give us the exclusive, Roger, and thank you.
[02:48:27.189 --> 02:48:32.889]  Alex, I think the most efficient way to do this is to just read the actual statement by President Donald J. Trump.
[02:48:32.989 --> 02:48:33.629]  And here we are.
[02:48:34.069 --> 02:48:36.030]  Statement by President Donald J. Trump.
[02:48:36.409 --> 02:48:48.750]  I am pleased to announce that former Congresswoman Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard will serve as the Director of National Intelligence, DNI. For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for...
[02:48:49.930 --> 02:48:51.590]  I'll just catch up in the statement here.
[02:48:51.829 --> 02:48:54.590]  Has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans.
[02:48:54.930 --> 02:49:01.409]  As a former candidate for the Democrat presidential nomination, she has broad experience in both parties.
[02:49:01.690 --> 02:49:03.510]  She is now a proud Republican.
[02:49:03.889 --> 02:49:14.309]  I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength.
[02:49:14.649 --> 02:49:16.530]  Tulsi will make us all proud.
[02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:24.549]  Tulsi Gabbard is a four-term congresswoman, a 2020 presidential candidate, and a New York Times bestselling author.
[02:49:24.909 --> 02:49:31.270]  Tulsi Gabbard is also a veteran with three deployments to war zones in the Middle East and Africa.
[02:49:31.469 --> 02:49:37.530]  She has served in uniform for more than two decades and is currently a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserve.
[02:49:38.090 --> 02:49:50.670]  We're good to go.
[02:49:55.399 --> 02:49:59.780]  Due to the attacks of 9-11, she enlisted in the Army National Guard.
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:10.100]  In 2004, she gave up an easy re-election campaign and volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the 29th Brigade Combat Team, where she served in a medical unit.
[02:50:10.739 --> 02:50:22.200]  After returning home in 2006, Tulsi worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to late Senator Daniel Akaka, who was chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
[02:50:22.559 --> 02:50:27.180]  She then volunteered for a second Middle East deployment as a platoon leader.
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:38.280]  Having experienced firsthand the true cost of war, Tulsi ran for the United States Congress at age 31, vowing to honor the lives and sacrifice for brothers and sisters in uniform.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:48.780]  She prevailed in a difficult election and went on to serve in Congress for eight years as a member of the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees and the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:57.020]  Forgoing a run for reelection to Congress in 2020, she was a candidate for president as a Democrat.
[02:50:57.819 --> 02:51:03.680]  In October 2022, Chelsea announced that she was leaving the Democrat Party, becoming an independent.
[02:51:03.979 --> 02:51:13.440]  She puts country before party and approaches every issue, domestic and foreign, based on ensuring the safety, security, and freedom of the American people.
[02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:25.969]  On August 26, 2024, Tulsi Gabbard formally endorsed President Donald Trump for a second term and soon after began serving as co-chairman of his transition team.
[02:51:26.430 --> 02:51:41.450]  On October 22, 2024, Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard joined the Republican Party because President Donald Trump's leadership and the way he has been able to transform the Republican Party into the party of peace, prosperity, and the people.
[02:51:41.729 --> 02:51:42.549]  There you have it.
[02:51:43.149 --> 02:51:45.290]  Alex, I think we've just broken this news.
[02:51:45.450 --> 02:51:48.590]  The president, I'm told, will be posting it momentarily.
[02:51:48.989 --> 02:52:00.209]  He sent it to me very kindly as a courtesy because he knows that I'm a great friend and admirer of Tulsi Gabbard, and I could not be happier than I am in this moment.
[02:52:00.709 --> 02:52:01.110]  Well, that's right.
[02:52:01.209 --> 02:52:06.090]  You guys on election night and then recently you were there with Trump and you and Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:08.559]  You know, they're just doing a fabulous job.
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:09.459]  This is so amazing.
[02:52:09.579 --> 02:52:10.739]  Roger, stay right there.
[02:52:10.879 --> 02:52:12.340]  We're going to come back and get this more.
[02:52:12.559 --> 02:52:15.340]  And then how the war to drain the swamp is going.
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:17.540]  Roger Stone, stonezone.com.
[02:52:17.659 --> 02:52:21.739]  Be sure and follow him there and on X. And I'm a real Alex Jones on X. Stay with us.
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:22.559]  All right.
[02:52:24.129 --> 02:52:24.729]  Exclusive.
[02:52:24.729 --> 02:52:25.329]  Breaking.
[02:52:25.889 --> 02:52:33.090]  Roger Stone was already scheduled in the last hour to come on with the latest on attempts to steal the Senate race in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:33.350 --> 02:52:35.409]  The clear theft in Wisconsin.
[02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:37.790]  These appointments.
[02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:46.670]  The globalist Senator John Thune that they have now placed despite what the voters in Trump wanted to lead the Senate.
[02:52:47.219 --> 02:52:48.479]  And so much more.
[02:52:49.079 --> 02:52:54.000]  And then, right as he's about to go live, Trump sends him the exclusive and says, you've got the exclusive.
[02:52:54.319 --> 02:52:55.799]  I'm breaking it in 20 minutes.
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:53:07.680]  Tulsi Gabbard, the former congresswoman and army colonel, has now been chosen to be the director of national intelligence, DNI. This is a huge deal.
[02:53:07.879 --> 02:53:09.780]  Roger, some stations didn't carry the last five.
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:14.540]  Recap this, and then give us your take on this major breaking news.
[02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:16.700]  Sure, Alex.
[02:53:16.879 --> 02:53:35.079]  Look, I think the president's made a number of great appointments so far, particularly Tom Homan, as the immigration czar to begin the deportation of millions of illegals in this country, starting with those who have criminal records, both either here or in their country of origin.
[02:53:35.239 --> 02:53:36.760]  I think that's a great, great appointment.
[02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:42.500]  I'm also very pleased by a number of his other appointments, but this is one I have been waiting for.
[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:45.600]  Chelsea Gabbard is a selfless patriot.
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:55.979]  Her book, Leaving It All Behind, about why she left the Democrat Party that she joined 20 years ago, the answer was very clear.
[02:53:56.139 --> 02:53:59.299]  She left it because it became the party of war.
[02:54:00.329 --> 02:54:01.610]  Censorship and death.
[02:54:02.129 --> 02:54:04.750]  And she's joined the new Republican Party.
[02:54:04.930 --> 02:54:07.969]  This is very different than the Republican Party of the Bushes.
[02:54:08.069 --> 02:54:13.129]  We are no longer the party of Wall Street, no longer the party of the country club elites.
[02:54:13.350 --> 02:54:15.950]  We're now the party of working people.
[02:54:16.209 --> 02:54:18.090]  We're the party of the middle class.
[02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:29.899]  So I must tell you, Alex, just as a politico, because that's what I am, I have rarely seen this kind of talent, this kind of communicative skills in anyone.
[02:54:30.299 --> 02:54:34.899]  Tulsi Gabbard is as effective a communicator as the great Ronald Reagan.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:41.059]  I was among those who urged her to go all the way and join the Republican Party.
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:45.159]  She left her party, the Democrats, as a matter of principle.
[02:54:45.989 --> 02:54:47.030]  She was an independent.
[02:54:47.489 --> 02:54:49.870]  She endorsed Donald Trump as an independent.
[02:54:50.309 --> 02:55:04.450]  Alex, she was on the road 38 days straight making speeches for Donald Trump without a single break every day, sometimes appearing with the president, sometimes appearing with RFK, sometimes just appearing by herself.
[02:55:05.290 --> 02:55:09.690]  I've seen the electricity between Tulsi Gabbard and a crowd.
[02:55:10.090 --> 02:55:15.329]  She reaches out, I think, for this administration Well beyond our base.
[02:55:15.450 --> 02:55:20.690]  I think she's attractive to millennials and she's attractive to women, quite obviously.
[02:55:21.069 --> 02:55:29.930]  She's attractive to libertarians and she's attractive to people who have not always traditionally been in our coalition.
[02:55:30.450 --> 02:55:37.770]  And as you correctly point out, this is the job previously held with distinction by Rick Grinnell.
[02:55:38.049 --> 02:55:45.329]  This is the job from which Rick Grinnell finally broke the Russian collusion hoax wide open.
[02:55:45.649 --> 02:55:59.840]  This is the person who essentially rides herd on for the president and monitors the activities of all the intelligence agencies, the FBI, The CIA, naval intelligence, and so on.
[02:55:59.979 --> 02:56:03.459]  So this is a great victory today for America.
[02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:14.920]  It's not just a great tribute to Tulsi Gabbard, a woman of enormous capability, who I think has a limitless political future, but is a great day for America.
[02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:19.040]  I can't even tell you how overjoyed I am by this moment.
[02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:22.819]  And the fact that we were able to break it right here on Infowars, well...
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.899]  Tomorrow's news today, InfoWars.
[02:56:26.319 --> 02:56:27.559]  Roger, we've been friends.
[02:56:27.959 --> 02:56:31.760]  I mean, I've known you for about 14 years, but I got to really know you in the last nine and a half.
[02:56:31.879 --> 02:56:32.879]  We've become really good friends.
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:34.260]  We talk all the time.
[02:56:35.279 --> 02:56:36.399]  You help me with stuff.
[02:56:36.399 --> 02:56:36.920]  I help you.
[02:56:37.139 --> 02:56:38.600]  We bounce ideas off each other.
[02:56:38.819 --> 02:56:47.840]  You tell me a lot of stuff, and I just consider it all off record, but you've told similar stories a lot that I also know are true because I saw them happen, where you explain how Trump is.
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:49.340]  He's super smart.
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:50.620]  He's amazing.
[02:56:50.819 --> 02:57:02.750]  When he gets the right information, he always makes the right decision, but he can't watch and know everything who could He didn't even really know who Tulsi Gabbards was, and that's why Roger and Tulsi are so close now.
[02:57:02.850 --> 02:57:03.389]  They've hit it off.
[02:57:03.489 --> 02:57:05.530]  They were at their table together at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:57:06.969 --> 02:57:08.549]  Nothing's going on like that, but you know what I mean?
[02:57:08.670 --> 02:57:12.870]  They're close because Roger kept pushing her and pushing her and pushing her.
[02:57:13.889 --> 02:57:24.659]  I don't know if this is off record well, but the point is to be VP or something like that, And then once Trump finally got to know her, he's like, good God, I love this lady.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:25.520]  She's amazing.
[02:57:25.819 --> 02:57:27.620]  And we're not saying that Vance isn't great.
[02:57:27.639 --> 02:57:29.059]  I'm not saying it should have been Tulsi.
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:30.579]  They're both amazing.
[02:57:30.579 --> 02:57:36.700]  But now that the more Trump spins around her, I mean, these two have really hit it off.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:37.899]  Now, you told me that.
[02:57:38.469 --> 02:57:41.270]  You were trying to get them together a couple years ago.
[02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:42.969]  A year ago, you said, I finally got them together.
[02:57:43.309 --> 02:57:45.370]  Six months ago, you go, oh, he really likes her.
[02:57:45.450 --> 02:57:47.430]  Now you're like, oh my God, this is something else.
[02:57:47.569 --> 02:57:48.729]  So this is exciting.
[02:57:48.930 --> 02:57:49.690]  She's a real lady.
[02:57:49.829 --> 02:57:50.610]  He's a real man.
[02:57:50.930 --> 02:57:51.930]  This is amazing.
[02:57:52.090 --> 02:57:52.889]  She's such an ally.
[02:57:52.989 --> 02:57:53.610]  She's so smart.
[02:57:53.729 --> 02:57:54.350]  She's so charismatic.
[02:57:55.069 --> 02:57:56.129]  So I kind of told the story.
[02:57:56.270 --> 02:57:59.889]  You didn't say it was off record, but am I in trouble for saying that or can you elaborate on it?
[02:58:00.350 --> 02:58:01.590]  No, I think all of that is true.
[02:58:01.709 --> 02:58:08.309]  First of all, I don't want to take anything away from J.D. Vance, because he turns out to be exactly the right guy at the right time.
[02:58:08.510 --> 02:58:11.049]  I have the highest possible regard for him.
[02:58:11.770 --> 02:58:19.649]  Weeks ago, when Republicans and Trump supporters were saying, oh, this guy was a mistake, and maybe we shouldn't have taken it, I said, no, you're absolutely wrong.
[02:58:19.850 --> 02:58:21.430]  His moment will come.
[02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:23.250]  His defining moment will come.
[02:58:23.290 --> 02:58:25.709]  It came in that vice presidential debate.
[02:58:25.809 --> 02:58:35.739]  It came through the extraordinary effort that he made to And you told me before anybody it was Vance, and then I met with him two months before Trump announced it.
[02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:36.600]  He said, no, I've got it.
[02:58:36.979 --> 02:58:37.979]  We're not putting him down.
[02:58:38.120 --> 02:58:41.959]  Before he was even on the radar, you were pushing Gabbards years ago, is my point.
[02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:43.260]  And so it all works out.
[02:58:43.399 --> 02:58:46.760]  It's just that that's why Trump is such a guy about personal stuff.
[02:58:46.879 --> 02:58:50.579]  He thought of you because you're the Tulsi booster, so he let you break it.
[02:58:50.639 --> 02:58:51.940]  It just shows how cool Trump is.
[02:58:52.899 --> 02:58:53.899]  Well, let me say this.
[02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:57.719]  I did kind of foresee that we would not be running against Joe Biden.
[02:58:57.899 --> 02:59:01.319]  I said that at the Turning Point USA conference last year.
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:04.319]  I thought we would be running against Kamala Harris.
[02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:09.200]  And therefore, I thought the ad addition of a woman to the Republican ticket would be great.
[02:59:09.440 --> 02:59:12.239]  So, yeah, she was my first choice for vice president.
[02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:17.760]  On the other hand, I was perfectly happy, extremely happy with the selection of J.D. Vance.
[02:59:17.899 --> 02:59:21.440]  By the way, J.D. Vance and Tulsi Gabbard get along extremely well.
[02:59:21.559 --> 02:59:22.500]  They have something in common.
[02:59:22.680 --> 02:59:24.459]  They're both against war.
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:27.780]  They're both against censorship.
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:37.500]  They both understand the epic evil of the deep state and the ruling elites who are seeking to cancel the U.S. Constitution.
[02:59:38.090 --> 02:59:42.510]  I think you're going to move very, very effectively together.
[02:59:42.889 --> 02:59:45.489]  And I think J.D. Vance will be a great ally.
[02:59:45.629 --> 02:59:48.250]  I only told the stories to show how real Trump is.
[02:59:48.370 --> 02:59:51.629]  Like, these new videos have come out that you see all the time by the scenes.
[02:59:51.790 --> 02:59:54.030]  But, I mean, Trump literally up at 2 a.m.
[02:59:54.450 --> 02:59:57.969]  ordering five people in live time, you know, what tweets to send out.
[02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:59.790]  I mean, people are like, oh, my God.
[02:59:59.870 --> 03:00:01.629]  I mean, this guy is on top of stuff.
[03:00:02.989 --> 03:00:05.110]  I don't know, Alex, to be honest with you.
[03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:06.450]  I don't know when he sleeps.
[03:00:07.309 --> 03:00:10.530]  I mean, I was texting back and forth to him late last night.
[03:00:10.690 --> 03:00:12.790]  I really don't know when he sleeps.
[03:00:13.909 --> 03:00:16.690]  It's peripatetic energy on his part.
[03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:23.129]  And of course, you can imagine right now the adrenaline level, just what the adrenaline level is like.
[03:00:23.129 --> 03:00:37.889]  He is so excited about this unique opportunity we have to move America into a golden age of prosperity, Peace, of opportunity, of security.
[03:00:38.209 --> 03:00:44.170]  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore the nation to its basics.
[03:00:44.690 --> 03:00:51.610]  And like President John F. Kennedy, he understands that a rising tide lifts all boats.
[03:00:51.770 --> 03:00:55.030]  He's not interested in just opportunity for his supporters.
[03:00:55.250 --> 03:00:57.690]  He's interested in opportunity for all Americans.
[03:00:58.250 --> 03:01:03.680]  And he takes these This opportunity extraordinarily carefully.
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:13.000]  He's being very, very meticulous in his selection process to get the very best men and women to help him in the task ahead.
[03:01:13.139 --> 03:01:14.219]  But let's make it very clear.
[03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:20.909]  Nobody was elected president here but Donald Trump, not Tulsi Gabbard, not J.D. Vance, not anybody.
[03:01:21.229 --> 03:01:23.489]  This is going to be the Trump presidency.
[03:01:23.850 --> 03:01:33.659]  As you pointed out at the top, when he first got to Washington in 2017, he didn't really know Washington, didn't really know the The system didn't really know the politicians.
[03:01:33.959 --> 03:01:36.760]  Now he is much, much wiser.
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:41.120]  That's why he is going about this in the way that he is.
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:44.200]  He's building an all-star team.
[03:01:44.559 --> 03:01:53.719]  I also have to give some substantial credit to our mutual friend, Tucker Carlson, who's also a major advocate for Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:01:53.819 --> 03:01:56.340]  They've been friends for longer than I've known her.
[03:01:56.540 --> 03:02:03.850]  So this is a great day for America, and the fact that He sent it to me first because he knew how happy it would make me.
[03:02:04.750 --> 03:02:08.350]  I really appreciate him as a friend.
[03:02:09.290 --> 03:02:12.950]  Roger, I know you've got to go soon, but I want to pick your brain about these good appointments.
[03:02:13.350 --> 03:02:14.950]  Trump's definitely going out to the swamp.
[03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:17.250]  The system is so scared.
[03:02:17.409 --> 03:02:20.129]  Some of these other races, other key intel, and I've got to give a big speech.
[03:02:20.549 --> 03:02:24.329]  But also, you might tell whoever's in the room talking, they might stop because it's drowning you out.
[03:02:24.770 --> 03:02:26.350]  I understand you're there at a big political thing.
[03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:27.709]  I guess some fans probably came in the room.
[03:02:27.709 --> 03:02:31.629]  I'm not sure, but I want to jump through the television here and strangle them in a loving way.
[03:02:32.069 --> 03:02:34.729]  But there's Roger 35-foot-thousand view.
[03:02:35.069 --> 03:02:36.209]  They're trying to steal Pennsylvania.
[03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:37.770]  You said earlier they're failing with this...
[03:02:38.399 --> 03:02:44.040]  With the Senate race, Wisconsin's coming out, illegals put it over the top for the Democrat, those magic votes that came in.
[03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:51.379]  In the few minutes you have left, watching Trump in his first days, the first week moving, I am very excited.
[03:02:51.479 --> 03:02:56.500]  I'm seeing nothing but good signs where he has the power, where he has the ability, shooting down Pompeo.
[03:02:57.399 --> 03:03:03.319]  Last week, I'm concerned about Rubio, unless he's really come to Jesus, you know, being Secretary of State.
[03:03:03.319 --> 03:03:04.540]  Maybe you can speak to that.
[03:03:05.379 --> 03:03:12.180]  The Senate Republicans choosing John Toon, which obviously we wanted Rick Scott.
[03:03:12.739 --> 03:03:18.059]  So, Roger, you've got the floor, and I know you've got to go soon, just to give us a boil down on what's currently happening.
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:24.340]  Alex, we just lost our connection, so now you are suddenly back.
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:27.239]  So I lost the last, I don't know, four minutes.
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:30.059]  Okay, a lot's happening here, Roger.
[03:03:30.379 --> 03:03:31.719]  You're the Politico expert.
[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:32.959]  You're just dead on.
[03:03:33.079 --> 03:03:34.399]  You said he'll probably win that night.
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:36.040]  You were right when nobody else was saying it.
[03:03:36.819 --> 03:03:41.079]  Looking at Trump in his first week, it looks like he's really going at the swamp's neck.
[03:03:42.879 --> 03:03:44.819]  What do you expect the establishment to do?
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:46.680]  What tricks do they have up their sleeve?
[03:03:48.229 --> 03:03:50.170]  Well, Alex, I really don't know.
[03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:52.829]  Here's what I do know, and that is they're diabolical.
[03:03:53.149 --> 03:03:54.829]  They are relentless.
[03:03:56.209 --> 03:03:59.270]  People who are evil don't give up power voluntarily.
[03:04:00.569 --> 03:04:05.409]  The thing I worry the most about, of course, is another assassination attempt.
[03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:10.629]  Now, normally you would say, oh, they are a conspiracy theory or some kind of...
[03:04:10.629 --> 03:04:13.370]  No, they've already tried at least twice that we know of.
[03:04:13.530 --> 03:04:16.989]  So why would any reasonable person think that they...
[03:04:17.659 --> 03:04:20.920]  We're good to go.
[03:04:39.370 --> 03:04:41.989]  We're good to go.
[03:04:55.039 --> 03:05:13.819]  To examine the way in which we legalize pharmaceuticals in this country, look into the way that the food companies are poisoning our citizens with the food that they sell us, I find it fascinating that That breakfast cereals,
[03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:18.159]  for example, have additives here in the United States that they don't have in Europe.
[03:05:18.159 --> 03:05:19.000]  How can that be?
[03:05:19.239 --> 03:05:32.139]  So I'm very committed to Robert Kennedy's quest to make America healthy again, particularly to his plans to try to deal with chronic childhood disease.
[03:05:32.500 --> 03:05:41.909]  We're waiting to see exactly what role in government that Bobby Kennedy is going to play, but this I do know.
[03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:50.709]  The president has every intention of keeping his commitments to Robert Kennedy and the Make America Healthy Again movement.
[03:05:50.829 --> 03:05:55.629]  It's a dynamic piece of the new governing coalition.
[03:05:55.629 --> 03:05:57.309]  We've talked about this on your show.
[03:05:57.430 --> 03:06:03.590]  So I think people have to recognize that this is much bigger than just the naming of a cabinet.
[03:06:03.850 --> 03:06:05.709]  It's much bigger than just some endorsements.
[03:06:05.909 --> 03:06:08.649]  There's a new majority in this country.
[03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:12.850]  And it's a populist majority.
[03:06:12.850 --> 03:06:20.670]  It's made up of Republicans and independents and libertarians and freethinkers and common-sense Democrats.
[03:06:20.829 --> 03:06:23.850]  Democrats who, oh my God, believe in capitalism.
[03:06:23.850 --> 03:06:24.729]  How about that?
[03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:28.989]  So this is the new governing coalition.
[03:06:29.329 --> 03:06:36.149]  And this could last for decades if Donald Trump does, as I expect, get this right.
[03:06:36.690 --> 03:06:40.750]  This was an important development today, the appointment of Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:06:41.309 --> 03:06:43.809]  I think she has an unlimited future.
[03:06:44.129 --> 03:06:46.569]  But this is not about her ambition.
[03:06:46.569 --> 03:06:48.450]  This was never about her ambition.
[03:06:48.750 --> 03:06:50.450]  It is always with her.
[03:06:50.569 --> 03:06:52.790]  It's always about her desire to serve.
[03:06:53.409 --> 03:06:57.149]  She's done it since her very early, a very, very early age.
[03:06:57.780 --> 03:07:00.219]  This is not, again, about her.
[03:07:00.399 --> 03:07:05.760]  It's about going and doing that which best serves the American people.
[03:07:05.959 --> 03:07:09.340]  This is a day I will remember for the rest of my life.
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:11.260]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:07:11.979 --> 03:07:12.540]  Roger.
[03:07:13.770 --> 03:07:28.129]  I'm seeing a lot of signs that the Democrat deep state, and not just your globalist, leftist, BlackRock-funded trash that are trying to weaken humanity in their own documents to make us controllable, are reassessing and saying the more we push, the more we get resistance.
[03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:30.389]  The dream team of RFK Jr.
[03:07:30.629 --> 03:07:35.090]  and Tulsi Gabbards and Elon Musk, the total game-changer, he's on total warpaths.
[03:07:35.209 --> 03:07:38.270]  He's going to campaign nonstop ahead of the midterms.
[03:07:38.770 --> 03:07:39.629]  There's this new...
[03:07:39.930 --> 03:07:45.250]  You know, system, you know, the Government Efficiency Bureau with him and Vivek.
[03:07:45.370 --> 03:07:46.889]  The left's like, it doesn't have power.
[03:07:47.010 --> 03:07:47.690]  It doesn't have a budget.
[03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:48.350]  That's right.
[03:07:48.430 --> 03:07:55.190]  It's outside perfectly with no budget so it can go out and expose the fraud and spotlight it for Trump.
[03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:58.350]  I mean, this is devastating.
[03:07:58.469 --> 03:08:05.450]  And I'm not saying we're out of the woods yet, but I don't want to be too much of a pessimist because I'm the one warning of martial law, false flags.
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:08.319]  Carvels say we're going to be violent if Trump gets elected.
[03:08:08.559 --> 03:08:12.780]  I just don't see them pulling any of this off and getting away with it.
[03:08:12.879 --> 03:08:17.459]  And I'm seeing a lot of signs in their own statements that they're trying to even figure out how to capitulate.
[03:08:17.639 --> 03:08:20.459]  You've got Zuckerberg three months ago rolling over, at least in public.
[03:08:20.879 --> 03:08:27.680]  You've got the owner of the Washington Post and big globalist Bezos saying, okay, I'm out of politics.
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:32.239]  You've got disgusting people like George Clooney, who's like...
[03:08:32.809 --> 03:08:37.170]  The mini-me and admittedly part of the council meetings with Obama saying he's done.
[03:08:37.850 --> 03:08:39.350]  They're talking about leaving the country.
[03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:40.729]  Some are saying they're going to stay.
[03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:47.469]  But I'm seeing real signs that they know they've crapped the bed and that there's a global realignment against them.
[03:08:48.969 --> 03:08:55.790]  Well, Alex, as you know, actor Robert De Niro said that if Donald Trump was elected, he would leave the country.
[03:08:55.930 --> 03:09:00.049]  I just want to let him know if he needs a lift to the airport, I'm available.
[03:09:01.869 --> 03:09:04.989]  Look, Alex, you're a Texan.
[03:09:05.409 --> 03:09:06.229]  You're a hunter.
[03:09:06.450 --> 03:09:09.370]  You've been hunting certainly far more times than I have.
[03:09:09.549 --> 03:09:12.770]  You're familiar with the concept of playing possum, right?
[03:09:12.889 --> 03:09:14.569]  You know how that works, playing possum?
[03:09:15.209 --> 03:09:16.950]  That's what I think is going on today.
[03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:28.680]  Anyone who thinks That Barack Obama and his minions are not somewhere in a compound planning some diabolical plot to thwart the will of the people.
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:33.059]  Well then they haven't been paying attention and they didn't see what they put this president through.
[03:09:33.340 --> 03:09:35.559]  They tried to bankrupt him.
[03:09:35.719 --> 03:09:37.540]  They tried to destroy his reputation.
[03:09:37.879 --> 03:09:42.790]  They tried to They tried to keep him off the ballot in all 50 states.
[03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:50.110]  These are people who will do anything whatsoever to cling to power, and therefore we cannot rest.
[03:09:50.250 --> 03:09:51.649]  We must remain vigilant.
[03:09:52.350 --> 03:09:55.729]  The president is well aware of this, I assure you.
[03:09:56.309 --> 03:10:00.129]  We should not be complacent for one moment.
[03:10:01.350 --> 03:10:03.010]  I can't tell you what they're doing.
[03:10:03.149 --> 03:10:03.670]  I don't know.
[03:10:03.809 --> 03:10:06.530]  I'm not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:10:06.889 --> 03:10:10.170]  They don't let me into the Trilateral Commission meetings.
[03:10:10.489 --> 03:10:13.610]  I'm not sure what they're up to, but here's what you can be for sure.
[03:10:13.850 --> 03:10:15.229]  They're up to something.
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:32.379]  If they did manage to maintain or pull off somehow a majority in the House, which right now does not look likely, could the communist congressman from Maryland, Jamie Raskin, the son of a communist, he was very clear that he didn't care how the people vote.
[03:10:32.479 --> 03:10:33.760]  It didn't matter how the people voted.
[03:10:33.899 --> 03:10:35.700]  We're not going to certify this election.
[03:10:36.350 --> 03:10:40.389]  Now, if I'd said that before the election, the FBI would have been at my front door again.
[03:10:40.989 --> 03:10:43.229]  But they act with impunity.
[03:10:43.469 --> 03:10:47.069]  Don't know what they're up to, but it's fair to say that it is something.
[03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:49.569]  No, I totally agree with you.
[03:10:49.709 --> 03:10:53.649]  And they pre-programmed martial law, civil unrest, race riots.
[03:10:53.790 --> 03:10:55.010]  They promised to do it.
[03:10:55.670 --> 03:11:02.629]  But now the trifecta of populist-winning elections all over the world, corporate media even admitting, hey, everybody hates us.
[03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:06.020]  We've got to reassess on MSNBC. I don't think they're beaten.
[03:11:06.299 --> 03:11:10.440]  I'm just saying they really realize that the more they push, whatever dirty tricks they pull, they don't work.
[03:11:10.579 --> 03:11:13.159]  So I think the assassination of Trump is all they've got.
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:15.379]  Then they got JD Vance to deal with.
[03:11:15.479 --> 03:11:20.079]  So both those guys should never be together at the same time, obviously.
[03:11:22.100 --> 03:11:26.500]  But looking at that, I mean, I agree, they're trying to play possum and steal some house seats.
[03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:32.040]  I think that window is basically closed, unless everyone that's still open, they steal all of those.
[03:11:32.219 --> 03:11:33.979]  So I think a 99% chance that doesn't happen.
[03:11:34.379 --> 03:11:38.239]  Just gut level, with all the gestalt of info, you've got only two minutes left.
[03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:40.379]  What should we be looking for then?
[03:11:40.379 --> 03:11:42.540]  A false flag where a bunch of minorities get killed.
[03:11:42.780 --> 03:11:44.540]  A Trump supporter supposedly did it.
[03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:47.860]  A giant cyber attack they claim the Russians engaged in.
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:49.440]  They've pre-programmed that.
[03:11:49.799 --> 03:11:51.760]  I mean, gut level, what are you worried about?
[03:11:53.869 --> 03:11:55.670]  It's very tough to say, Alex.
[03:11:55.790 --> 03:11:58.930]  And I, you know, I don't I never speak in hypotheticals, you know that.
[03:11:59.430 --> 03:12:09.569]  But it was interesting to me that for the final two weeks of this election, CNN's home site are constantly pushing yet again the Russian interference.
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:13.079]  There's no Russian interference in our last elections.
[03:12:13.239 --> 03:12:18.600]  If there is, unlike 2017 when there wasn't them, but you claim there was, show us the proof.
[03:12:18.700 --> 03:12:19.540]  Not your claim.
[03:12:19.739 --> 03:12:21.340]  Not just that you say it happened.
[03:12:21.459 --> 03:12:23.620]  Let's see proof that it happens.
[03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:28.319]  I still think that they may try to resurrect that canard.
[03:12:28.479 --> 03:12:32.520]  Or just perhaps it will be some claim of Iranian interference.
[03:12:32.940 --> 03:12:37.180]  Look, there are better qualified people to speak to this than I am.
[03:12:37.219 --> 03:12:38.100]  Yeah, well, Flynn agrees.
[03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:42.409]  They're pre-programming The deep state trying to kill Trump and then blaming it on Iran.
[03:12:42.549 --> 03:12:44.770]  Then they get World War III and Trump dead.
[03:12:44.969 --> 03:12:51.190]  So I think, do you know yet whether they have military aircraft he requested months ago that Biden agreed to that we know weren't put in as of a few weeks ago?
[03:12:51.370 --> 03:12:53.149]  Does he have anti-missile defense yet?
[03:12:53.770 --> 03:12:55.450]  I don't know the answer to that.
[03:12:55.850 --> 03:12:57.090]  I really don't.
[03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:58.469]  I hope that it's true.
[03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:59.469]  I hope that it's true.
[03:12:59.690 --> 03:13:03.409]  But Alex, I really don't honestly know the answer.
[03:13:03.629 --> 03:13:06.270]  Let me say it one more time in case anybody didn't catch it.
[03:13:06.409 --> 03:13:09.010]  What's the best thing you can do right now for our nation?
[03:13:09.430 --> 03:13:11.729]  For this movement for the future of America.
[03:13:12.010 --> 03:13:13.090]  Pray, my friends.
[03:13:13.290 --> 03:13:14.590]  Get down on your knees and pray.
[03:13:14.770 --> 03:13:18.049]  Thank Jesus Christ for this extraordinary victory.
[03:13:18.770 --> 03:13:24.110]  And pray for the wisdom and the guidance that comes from faith in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[03:13:24.709 --> 03:13:27.750]  You know, at Washington Monthly, when I say things like that, they attack me.
[03:13:27.850 --> 03:13:28.969]  They say, oh, it's an act.
[03:13:28.989 --> 03:13:30.309]  It's a head fake.
[03:13:30.450 --> 03:13:32.190]  It's Stone trying to get sympathy.
[03:13:32.629 --> 03:13:34.969]  He's a white Christian nationalist.
[03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:42.469]  I'm white, I'm Christian, and I love my country, so I guess I am a white Christian nationalist.
[03:13:42.629 --> 03:13:43.389]  So what?
[03:13:43.549 --> 03:13:44.030]  What does that mean?
[03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:46.370]  It's better than a Democrat, Satan worshiper, pedophile.
[03:13:46.649 --> 03:13:48.770]  In closing, StoneZone.com.
[03:13:48.930 --> 03:13:52.649]  People who support Roger Stone thank President Trump for giving you the exclusive and you gave it to us.
[03:13:52.690 --> 03:13:53.430]  Thanks for sharing that.
[03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:56.870]  Just the planets align that way because you're already coming on with an emergency transmission.
[03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:59.129]  We'll talk soon, my friend.
[03:13:59.489 --> 03:14:05.670]  But in closing, Deep State's got to really be crapping their britches with Tulsi Gabbard as the head of national intelligence.
[03:14:06.619 --> 03:14:09.940]  This is a great, great appointment and a great, great day for America.
[03:14:10.139 --> 03:14:10.659]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:12.700]  There goes Roger Stone.
[03:14:13.500 --> 03:14:17.120]  All right, I've got a bunch of final news to hit in the last 30 minutes.
[03:14:18.879 --> 03:14:23.079]  Everybody is calling me, emails blowing up, people are showing up at the studios.
[03:14:23.479 --> 03:14:25.559]  Is Infowars still going to be on the air?
[03:14:25.739 --> 03:14:28.319]  The auction, did it get sold?
[03:14:28.739 --> 03:14:29.979]  Did a good guy get it?
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:31.959]  I'll answer those questions when we come back.
[03:14:32.889 --> 03:14:37.670]  And then there's the whole other thing where we've survived so many attempts to take us off air.
[03:14:37.969 --> 03:14:39.829]  People kind of like, are you crying wolf?
[03:14:39.969 --> 03:14:41.290]  You've seen it all in the news.
[03:14:41.850 --> 03:14:42.530]  God's real.
[03:14:42.709 --> 03:14:44.129]  Trump survived, you know, all this stuff.
[03:14:44.350 --> 03:14:45.510]  But I don't know yet.
[03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:47.510]  I mean, I'll tell you the latest when we come back.
[03:14:47.649 --> 03:14:48.790]  It's driving me crazy, too.
[03:14:50.250 --> 03:14:53.790]  Because I just want to know, is this our last day here or not?
[03:14:54.069 --> 03:15:00.930]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say, because it is critical in three important ways.
[03:15:01.149 --> 03:15:03.530]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[03:15:03.889 --> 03:15:11.850]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints.
[03:15:12.459 --> 03:15:16.219]  You name it, and you're getting the best deal you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:15:16.500 --> 03:15:19.420]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:23.860]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:37.260]  This is a high quality, made in Texas, very strong CBD, thousand milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[03:15:38.079 --> 03:15:47.860]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[03:15:48.500 --> 03:15:54.719]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[03:15:55.049 --> 03:15:57.709]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[03:15:58.049 --> 03:16:05.989]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[03:16:06.069 --> 03:16:12.790]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit jonescbd.com.
[03:16:15.629 --> 03:16:17.329]  Let me tell you the names of these products.
[03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:20.489]  Ultra Green, because it's amazing.
[03:16:20.709 --> 03:16:21.790]  And Dreamwave.
[03:16:22.010 --> 03:16:25.170]  You want to get both of these, and it supports the broadcast.
[03:16:25.170 --> 03:16:34.889]  You will not be disappointed, particularly if you're already into CBD, and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying, and you get a great response.
[03:16:34.930 --> 03:16:36.149]  I know you're going to love it.
[03:16:36.299 --> 03:16:40.639]  That's what I'm looking for as repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.

[03:17:19.239 --> 03:17:28.059]  And a lot of those women, you know, out there that have this issue that she's talking about need HydroForce because it's a really good quality, but everybody else needs it as well.

[03:17:40.129 --> 03:17:41.170]  We private label it.
[03:17:41.309 --> 03:17:42.729]  One of the top companies in the nation.
[03:17:42.930 --> 03:17:46.209]  So when you get Ultimate CMOS, it's an amazing superfood.

[03:18:12.430 --> 03:18:18.110]  While you're eating all that stuff, you were talking about the ribs and the macaroni and everything else.
[03:18:18.190 --> 03:18:18.889]  I hear you, I'm getting hungry.
[03:18:19.270 --> 03:18:24.370]  Well, that's what you got your probiotic for, to help, you know, make sure a little good bacteria, help process.
[03:18:24.489 --> 03:18:25.969]  You're like, bacteria in my gut?
[03:18:26.049 --> 03:18:27.149]  Well, you actually probably are pretty smart.
[03:18:27.149 --> 03:18:27.729]  You probably know about that.
[03:18:27.809 --> 03:18:29.049]  You were telling other girls about stuff.
[03:18:29.469 --> 03:18:40.610]  So, it's all available, everything for Cardi B. Everything from Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi and Liz Cheney, all you girls that want to be healthy.
[03:18:41.969 --> 03:18:43.569]  You don't want to take those COVID shots.
[03:18:43.709 --> 03:18:44.750]  You don't want to drink that fluoride.
[03:18:44.829 --> 03:18:45.909]  You want to listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:46.690 --> 03:18:49.409]  You want to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:18:53.590 --> 03:19:06.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, not only did we exclusively break the news, T-minus 35 minutes ago with the great Roger Stone contacted directly by President Trump.
[03:19:07.629 --> 03:19:23.809]  Because he's the big Tulsi Gabbard booster with the fact that she had been tapped to be the director of national intelligence over all 16 intelligence agencies that have been waging war with the American people since the 1947 National Security Act, the heart of the deep state.
[03:19:24.569 --> 03:19:35.389]  Now in the ultimate justice with an ice icing and gravy of revenge.
[03:19:38.059 --> 03:19:51.500]  Matt Gaetz, targeted by the deep state, as Attorney General, breaking CNBC. Boy, you know, this just broke a few minutes ago.
[03:19:51.719 --> 03:19:56.100]  They are going to be crapping lead bricks.
[03:19:57.520 --> 03:20:04.079]  I mean, he is smart, and he is vicious, and he is vindictive.
[03:20:04.860 --> 03:20:06.139]  And that's what we need.
[03:20:06.360 --> 03:20:14.180]  These damn people have been torturing the living hell out of this country and have messed with my family who are completely innocent.
[03:20:15.180 --> 03:20:18.739]  I haven't told you 10% of the stuff they pulled.
[03:20:19.700 --> 03:20:27.340]  And don't worry, all I did was enrage my father and mother and family, so you didn't do anything but piss me off and piss them off.
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:29.059]  And they mess with his family too.
[03:20:29.780 --> 03:20:30.299]  So...
[03:20:31.319 --> 03:20:32.739]  I'm going to tell the global of something.
[03:20:33.139 --> 03:20:35.520]  You're not going to get away with shooting his airplane down.
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:38.079]  And you're not going to get away with poisoning him.
[03:20:38.840 --> 03:20:39.860]  And you're screwed.
[03:20:40.620 --> 03:20:43.440]  So, Roger's right though.
[03:20:45.780 --> 03:20:47.540]  They're playing possum right now.
[03:20:49.100 --> 03:20:52.020]  But, it's because they don't know what to do.
[03:20:53.239 --> 03:20:54.860]  And they're scheming up a bunch of crap.
[03:20:57.829 --> 03:20:59.649]  Let's read President Trump's announcement.
[03:20:59.770 --> 03:21:00.870]  Let me have a drink of Tapa Chico.
[03:21:01.170 --> 03:21:05.030]  You know, they're not a sponsor, but I've been drinking this before it was cool over 30 years.
[03:21:07.770 --> 03:21:11.229]  Now it's the liberal trendy thing to do, but I might have to stop drinking it because of that.
[03:21:11.629 --> 03:21:14.309]  But here is Trump's statement.
[03:21:14.610 --> 03:21:21.010]  It is my great honor to announce that Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is hereby nominated to be the Attorney General of the United States.
[03:21:21.170 --> 03:21:30.049]  Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney trained at the William and Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving...
[03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:33.899]  Desperately needed reform of the Department of Justice.
[03:21:34.260 --> 03:21:39.059]  Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan weaponization of our justice system.
[03:21:50.579 --> 03:22:03.739]  On the House Judiciary Committee, which performs oversight of the DOJ, Matt played a key role in defeating the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax and exposing alarming and systematic government corruption and weaponization, not to mention censorship.
[03:22:03.879 --> 03:22:08.600]  He is a champion of the Constitution and rule of law.
[03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:11.399]  Boom, baby!
[03:22:11.959 --> 03:22:13.040]  Ha ha ha ha!
[03:22:17.979 --> 03:22:24.500]  Oh, Mayorkas, the child trafficking person who we don't know is a pedophile.
[03:22:26.739 --> 03:22:30.899]  But he certainly headed up one of the main organizations in the world that's been caught heavily connected to it.
[03:22:31.020 --> 03:22:34.940]  And he certainly disappeared those 325,000 kids and stopped the DNA testing.
[03:22:35.159 --> 03:22:35.979]  They didn't lose them.
[03:22:36.079 --> 03:22:36.360]  They did it.
[03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:44.360]  And let me tell you, if there's justice on earth, Napoleon thought he was invincible.
[03:22:45.340 --> 03:22:46.840]  Hitler thought he was invincible.
[03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:49.260]  Pol Pot thought he was invincible.
[03:22:49.860 --> 03:22:51.760]  A lot of these guys think they're invincible.
[03:22:54.139 --> 03:22:56.979]  Well, I say they bit off more than they can chew.
[03:22:59.579 --> 03:23:08.899]  And I say, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:13.479]  And all I can tell you is, I've been on air 30 and a half years.
[03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:27.309]  And I certainly didn't bring the pain to the New World Order, but this broadcast and our crew and our guests amplified it from a whisper of resistance to a roar.
[03:23:28.209 --> 03:23:42.489]  And thank God I grew up, as Providence would have it, with both sides of my family extremely educated on the real world, a real world experience, and on history.
[03:23:43.690 --> 03:23:46.069]  And they knew how America worked, how the world worked.
[03:23:46.170 --> 03:23:50.709]  They gave me a passion for understanding history, a passion for understanding systems.
[03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:59.469]  And how to skin a buck, run a trot line, kick ass, and grow a garden, and change diapers, and cook dinner, and roof a house.
[03:24:02.090 --> 03:24:04.229]  And how to enjoy great literature and music.
[03:24:04.610 --> 03:24:08.530]  And I just am so blessed that I've been fighting them since I was 20 years old.
[03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:22.049]  And we have just seen our resistance go from minuscule to ultra-gargantuan, titan-level, colossus of roads.
[03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:27.610]  And it's just exploding, and they'll never stop us now.
[03:24:27.909 --> 03:24:31.489]  I think it's caused a nuclear war and killed 7 billion people.
[03:24:32.370 --> 03:24:38.549]  But there'll be so many people that know who did it, who was behind it, you won't be able to hide anywhere in the world order.
[03:24:39.989 --> 03:24:45.270]  Not in your underground mountain fortresses and redoubts and keeps.
[03:24:47.370 --> 03:24:53.670]  And so, I'm not declaring we won the war yet, far from it.
[03:24:53.930 --> 03:24:57.850]  But baby, we will win and we will succeed.
[03:24:58.090 --> 03:24:59.209]  I mean, whew.
[03:24:59.670 --> 03:25:08.250]  So, if today's the day the bad guys at the auction, forced auction at Bankrupts InfoWars get us, it's a hassle.
[03:25:09.350 --> 03:25:13.010]  And we've got our little studio built, and we got the big one being built.
[03:25:13.889 --> 03:25:19.049]  And we've got, you know, I could instantly step into huge studios in Florida and other areas, but I love the crew.
[03:25:19.250 --> 03:25:20.110]  My family's here.
[03:25:20.829 --> 03:25:22.709]  Austin's been taken over by communists for now.
[03:25:23.049 --> 03:25:35.430]  It's not a good jurisdiction to be in, but we're going to get so big and expand one way or another, whether M4 survives or not, the Alex Jones Network, that we'll have an Austin bureau even if I leave this area.
[03:25:36.209 --> 03:25:41.069]  And I'll probably just move to some county outside that's Republican as the main command base.
[03:25:41.209 --> 03:25:43.569]  But Evacuate?
[03:25:43.729 --> 03:25:44.510]  In a moment of triumph?
[03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:46.290]  I think you overestimate their chances.
[03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:50.350]  Well, they're the empire, and we just blew up the Death Star.
[03:25:51.010 --> 03:25:54.350]  So, the war's not over, but we've got the initiative when we're winning.
[03:25:55.190 --> 03:26:06.049]  Everybody's tuning in right now saying, I mean, a lot of folks, well, wait, we heard CNN said, the Associated Press said, you'd be, you know, the auction is today.
[03:26:07.239 --> 03:26:08.899]  Well, here's how this stuff works.
[03:26:09.420 --> 03:26:16.280]  I told my lawyers, and I told the Patriot groups, there's quite a few groups that said they were coming and buy it.
[03:26:16.819 --> 03:26:23.559]  I said, great, day one, you give me a contract, I can say whatever I want, do whatever I want, the crew's still hired, I'll work for you.
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:29.559]  But immediately you do that, you give me any sideway crap, nobody's telling me what to say.
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:30.420]  No, no, no, no, whatever.
[03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:33.620]  So I'm sure those are great guys, I know some of the groups a long time.
[03:26:34.700 --> 03:26:37.120]  You know, we even had some huge Trump heavy hitters.
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:40.440]  I mean, well-known people, I won't say their names, were ready to come in.
[03:26:40.559 --> 03:26:42.239]  And I just said, hold your horses.
[03:26:49.059 --> 03:26:52.639]  I don't think they're going to even let you really try to buy it.
[03:26:52.959 --> 03:26:54.219]  They're like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[03:26:54.500 --> 03:26:59.760]  You know, it's one of the big top auction places and it's federally ordered.
[03:27:00.959 --> 03:27:02.540]  Things are corrupt, but not that bad.
[03:27:02.620 --> 03:27:03.379]  Maybe they're right.
[03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:06.510]  This auction was announced months ago.
[03:27:06.909 --> 03:27:09.090]  The last bids were supposed to be in on November 8th.
[03:27:09.489 --> 03:27:13.430]  And then Monday at about 2 o'clock, my lawyers and people got called.
[03:27:14.709 --> 03:27:16.770]  I talked to them by 3 when I got off the air.
[03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:18.270]  They were trying to call me at like 2 o'clock.
[03:27:19.190 --> 03:27:20.569]  But I called when I got off air.
[03:27:21.610 --> 03:27:24.090]  And they're like, well, you're not going to believe this.
[03:27:24.170 --> 03:27:25.170]  What you predicted just happened.
[03:27:25.270 --> 03:27:26.670]  I said, what?
[03:27:28.069 --> 03:27:28.790]  Let me guess.
[03:27:28.889 --> 03:27:29.770]  It has to do with the auction.
[03:27:30.709 --> 03:27:31.770]  They just changed it.
[03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:33.370]  And they go, yeah, it's...
[03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:36.569]  It's not going to be an auction.
[03:27:36.809 --> 03:27:40.209]  Boy, you think of an auction that people have until 10 a.m.
[03:27:40.370 --> 03:27:47.770]  Central on Wednesday, November 13th, to put in a sealed bid, and no one ever gets to know what the other bids were.
[03:27:48.209 --> 03:27:49.549]  Only the winner will be known.
[03:27:50.569 --> 03:27:58.299]  And they reserve the right, the U.S. trustee, To give it to someone for less.
[03:27:58.579 --> 03:28:01.200]  I went, oh, that really doesn't sound rigged at all.
[03:28:02.239 --> 03:28:03.920]  I mean, that sounds completely above board.
[03:28:04.879 --> 03:28:11.819]  And I said, I told you, because nothing in my persecution has ever been based in reality.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:14.059]  I mean, they are based in law.
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:18.899]  I mean, they showed up in late May with armed security with no court order and said, get out of the building.
[03:28:19.020 --> 03:28:20.340]  And I said, give me your court order.
[03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:22.430]  You better call your bosses.
[03:28:22.549 --> 03:28:31.489]  They went, yo, I'm talking to the head of the screen, but yeah, I got a lady from the Justice Department, you know, saying, I'm with the Justice Department, I'm a trustee, you don't need any documents, trust me, I'm a lawyer.
[03:28:32.129 --> 03:28:33.790]  And I said, well, you're not stupid, are you?
[03:28:33.829 --> 03:28:34.649]  Because I said, I'm not leaving.
[03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:36.729]  I said, I'm going to call the police.
[03:28:37.469 --> 03:28:38.969]  They went, no, no, no, no, we understand.
[03:28:39.889 --> 03:28:43.049]  So, I mean, you're not in Kansas anymore when that's going on.
[03:28:43.170 --> 03:28:45.209]  So, it wasn't a leap, right?
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:54.139]  To imagine that a public auction where people can see the bids and who's bidding and you can, like an auction, you know, oh, I want to go more?
[03:28:56.299 --> 03:28:58.239]  And maybe there's some reason for this.
[03:28:58.399 --> 03:29:00.059]  We don't talk to the auction place.
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:04.719]  The U.S. trustee doesn't say he's nice, doesn't have a bad name, the new guy.
[03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:11.079]  The last people were just maniacs trying to get me in trouble and, of course, failed.
[03:29:11.440 --> 03:29:16.139]  I mean, literally setting me up, like filing with the court that they caught me with hidden money.
[03:29:16.299 --> 03:29:18.520]  And we went, got a little problem there.
[03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:20.700]  We're on record with our lawyers and emails for months.
[03:29:20.899 --> 03:29:27.649]  When you came in as the new trustee and people saying, here's a sponsor we have, That they pay me directly through an ad agency.
[03:29:27.649 --> 03:29:29.090]  We want to bring all this money in.
[03:29:29.149 --> 03:29:29.930]  It's in a bank account.
[03:29:30.430 --> 03:29:32.729]  And then you said, oh, just keep that.
[03:29:32.889 --> 03:29:36.110]  So we start getting paranoid and start with our phones.
[03:29:37.490 --> 03:29:38.610]  You know what that means?
[03:29:38.709 --> 03:29:39.829]  You have recordings of it?
[03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:40.250]  Yeah.
[03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:42.389]  And I told my lawyers I'm being set up.
[03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:47.370]  So we filed with the court two and a half months before they filed a secret letter to the judge.
[03:29:47.489 --> 03:29:48.629]  They caught me in theft.
[03:29:49.409 --> 03:29:56.010]  And they were so lazy they didn't read our federal filing to the judge that they wouldn't take the money and we didn't know what to do with it.
[03:29:57.909 --> 03:30:01.790]  So, see, I know who I'm up against, you dumb creatures.
[03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:04.670]  And you think everybody's like you?
[03:30:05.329 --> 03:30:06.530]  Bunch of scum!
[03:30:06.989 --> 03:30:08.709]  There are a lot of people who aren't.
[03:30:08.889 --> 03:30:14.290]  But just because we're not scum doesn't mean we don't know what scum is.
[03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:21.510]  So, and there's a lot of other crap that went on.
[03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:33.590]  The CRO, you know, chief restructuring officer, you know, it comes into my office one day, like 5 o'clock, when he's here like once every two weeks, he goes, hey Alex, everything's fine.
[03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:39.870]  You say, work with us, do whatever, you know, and you know, we don't care if you keep money on the side.
[03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:43.229]  And I'm like, uh, what are you talking about?
[03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:45.469]  Well, you know, just do whatever you want.
[03:30:46.159 --> 03:30:47.920]  I went, I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.
[03:30:48.700 --> 03:30:49.899]  Go to the bathroom, come back.
[03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:52.379]  Say that again.
[03:30:52.559 --> 03:30:57.620]  Just like in Wolf of Wall Street, when the FBI goes, he says to the one guy on the other agent, he goes, say that again.
[03:30:58.600 --> 03:31:00.200]  Dumb enough to say it again.
[03:31:03.879 --> 03:31:14.239]  So, these people, because they're the left, this guy's a big leftist, they're allowed to do whatever they want and treat us like we're criminals while they do stuff that I think on its face is illegal as hell.
[03:31:14.620 --> 03:31:15.920]  And I'm tired of it.
[03:31:17.420 --> 03:31:25.090]  So, That guy didn't even have a name, you know, in the business because all these other trustees wouldn't take the job.
[03:31:25.209 --> 03:31:27.229]  So it kept going through the rotation.
[03:31:27.450 --> 03:31:29.770]  You know, the judge finally goes, okay, I got somebody that will accept me in the trustee.
[03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:30.590]  You're the trustee.
[03:31:30.709 --> 03:31:35.989]  You're the CRO. And then I put up with just all the sabotage and BS for a year and a half.
[03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:40.829]  And I've already released one recording of the guy.
[03:31:42.530 --> 03:31:44.489]  I was at Tucker Carlson's in Florida.
[03:31:45.879 --> 03:31:52.159]  And the judge sends my lawyers his secret filing saying Alex Jones is incompetent.
[03:31:52.299 --> 03:31:52.840]  He's horrible.
[03:31:52.860 --> 03:31:54.000]  He's keeping money.
[03:31:54.219 --> 03:31:55.079]  He's terrible.
[03:31:55.340 --> 03:32:04.600]  So I call him up and, of course, record it while we're driving in the car back to Tucker's.
[03:32:04.860 --> 03:32:06.879]  And you've heard the tape.
[03:32:07.059 --> 03:32:08.260]  I played it and played again, I guess.
[03:32:08.399 --> 03:32:09.239]  We should play it today.
[03:32:09.739 --> 03:32:10.920]  Maybe we should play some other stuff today.
[03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:12.440]  I'm really thinking about it.
[03:32:13.319 --> 03:32:16.510]  And He's drunk.
[03:32:18.590 --> 03:32:21.670]  And I go, hey man, you filed this thing.
[03:32:24.829 --> 03:32:28.829]  And I said, you know, you know he filed in court before you ever did that.
[03:32:29.489 --> 03:32:31.909]  About this money, you know I tried to give it to you over and over again.
[03:32:32.409 --> 03:32:33.469]  You wouldn't take it.
[03:32:34.440 --> 03:32:36.399]  He's like, Alex, no, I didn't file anything.
[03:32:36.540 --> 03:32:38.040]  I promise you.
[03:32:38.200 --> 03:32:39.479]  It says 15 times.
[03:32:39.620 --> 03:32:39.860]  We counted.
[03:32:40.319 --> 03:32:41.520]  Alex, it's not true.
[03:32:41.639 --> 03:32:42.299]  There's no filing.
[03:32:42.700 --> 03:32:43.479]  I go, funny.
[03:32:43.620 --> 03:32:51.399]  It's got Judge Chris Lopez's seal on it, and he sent it to us today at 2 o'clock.
[03:32:51.399 --> 03:32:53.620]  I just now read it because I was busy.
[03:32:54.100 --> 03:32:55.760]  He goes, nope, not real.
[03:32:55.799 --> 03:32:57.260]  I didn't do that, Alex.
[03:32:59.120 --> 03:33:04.139]  And another 13 times, he says, it's not real.
[03:33:09.850 --> 03:33:23.870]  And then, I get back, and a week later, they send armed men here with no court order to say leave.
[03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:39.069]  Then, on the 14th, when he fires them, they testify first, and the guy gets up, his name's Pat McGill, and he goes, well, the judge's like, well, why were you going to close the doors?
[03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:40.870]  He goes, well, that was a security issue.
[03:33:41.350 --> 03:33:42.590]  This is all on the stand, this transcript.
[03:33:42.709 --> 03:33:43.629]  He goes, that was a security issue.
[03:33:44.889 --> 03:33:48.090]  And the judge goes, well, there were guns, your honor.
[03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:50.229]  And he goes, and what was happening with the guns?
[03:33:50.329 --> 03:33:55.250]  I said, well, I couldn't say who, but someone had a gun, and there was a concern.
[03:33:55.250 --> 03:33:56.090]  I got a report.
[03:34:04.100 --> 03:34:05.920]  So, I've got a gun in my office.
[03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:07.659]  We got armed security.
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:10.260]  The crew has concealed carry if they want to.
[03:34:10.739 --> 03:34:12.000]  There's never been an incident here.
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:12.819]  Never a fist fight.
[03:34:12.940 --> 03:34:13.500]  Never a problem.
[03:34:13.639 --> 03:34:14.120]  Never an issue.
[03:34:14.180 --> 03:34:16.319]  Never have the police called over any issues here.
[03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:18.940]  We've had police here when people try to break in the building a few times.
[03:34:21.239 --> 03:34:22.819]  Here in the defund the police area.
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:25.059]  I mean, all these cars and buildings get broken into.
[03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:26.559]  But that's it.
[03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:28.420]  Cops are all basically listeners.
[03:34:30.840 --> 03:34:35.940]  And The judge just laughs at him.
[03:34:38.719 --> 03:34:40.959]  So, and says, you got one more duty.
[03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:41.360]  Give Mr.
[03:34:41.459 --> 03:34:42.219]  Jones control of his company.
[03:34:42.340 --> 03:34:43.159]  Bank accounts, goodbye.
[03:34:43.280 --> 03:34:43.899]  You're dismissed.
[03:34:45.109 --> 03:34:48.170]  And the guy actually goes, no, your honor, I run it, I run it.
[03:34:48.250 --> 03:34:50.969]  And he goes, let me explain to you, you never ran that company.
[03:34:51.129 --> 03:34:52.110]  Alex Jones is the owner.
[03:34:52.290 --> 03:34:53.909]  You couldn't do any of the things you tried.
[03:34:54.069 --> 03:35:00.430]  He starts arguing, and the judge says over and over to him very nicely, you were never in charge.
[03:35:00.709 --> 03:35:02.350]  You weren't allowed to do all this.
[03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:03.209]  Do you understand?
[03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:05.430]  Then the U.S. trustee gets up.
[03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:09.620]  He goes, your honor, don't let him have the bank accounts.
[03:35:10.340 --> 03:35:15.000]  He'll, he'll, he'll, and the judge goes, you've had years to bring something on him.
[03:35:15.159 --> 03:35:22.920]  You people had all these outside accounting firms that he paid for, millions of dollars he paid, to come in here and fine-tooth comb me.
[03:35:23.020 --> 03:35:25.219]  The judge's like, you never found anything.
[03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:29.620]  You never made claims, other than your secret filing.
[03:35:31.010 --> 03:35:36.610]  They think it's open season to do whatever they want to us, whenever they want to us.
[03:35:37.909 --> 03:35:39.350]  And that's coming to an end.
[03:35:40.010 --> 03:35:41.389]  With not just me, with everybody.
[03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:43.350]  Because America's done and taken it.
[03:35:44.610 --> 03:35:51.489]  If you want to get resisted politically, culturally, legally, you found the right place.
[03:35:52.190 --> 03:35:55.290]  So, I don't know what's going to happen with the sale.
[03:35:55.450 --> 03:35:56.969]  I don't know if they'll announce it today, tomorrow.
[03:35:57.250 --> 03:35:58.989]  I don't know if they'll say, oh, the...
[03:35:59.950 --> 03:36:00.909]  The auction's pulled.
[03:36:01.049 --> 03:36:04.149]  You were just going to not let anybody buy it and shut it down.
[03:36:04.270 --> 03:36:05.389]  I know that's being discussed.
[03:36:05.629 --> 03:36:06.549]  That's not in the law.
[03:36:06.709 --> 03:36:08.389]  I don't think the judge will put up with that.
[03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:11.069]  Because now people know what's going on.
[03:36:11.430 --> 03:36:13.409]  And I'm not saying that's what the new trustee's doing.
[03:36:13.489 --> 03:36:14.250]  I'm sure he's great.
[03:36:15.889 --> 03:36:16.569]  Got a good name.
[03:36:16.989 --> 03:36:18.090]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:36:18.209 --> 03:36:30.309]  But you hear there's a public auction, then two days before it's off, then you tell, oh, you put in one bid and that's it, and then we don't tell you what the other bids were, but we say who the winner is, but we reserve the right to have a blesser bid be the winner.
[03:36:31.069 --> 03:36:35.190]  That is in the writing of the new rule that he says he has the authority of to do.
[03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:51.260]  So, if that sounds normal to you, you probably think they're I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:54.200]  I don't know what the hell's going on around here.
[03:36:54.319 --> 03:37:00.520]  But I told my lawyers and everybody else, I expect some real shenanigans when it gets down to this auction.
[03:37:00.739 --> 03:37:16.100]  Because that's all I've ever seen experiencing the Democratic Party law firms, the top ones that represent Hillary Clinton, That sue Trump and sue Giuliani and sue everybody else and harass the snot out of us,
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:29.520]  they have spent now upwards of $80 million harassing the living hell out of me and my crew and my family in the last six and a half, seven years.
[03:37:32.040 --> 03:37:33.500]  And I expected it all.
[03:37:33.700 --> 03:37:34.239]  It was interesting.
[03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:35.219]  It was quite informative.
[03:37:35.659 --> 03:37:36.260]  But...
[03:37:37.860 --> 03:37:42.340]  And we've spent like, it's up to like 16 million now fighting them off.
[03:37:43.319 --> 03:37:44.600]  And boy, did your support.
[03:37:44.819 --> 03:37:47.280]  You think I want to go over and twist your arm to buy supplements?
[03:37:48.059 --> 03:37:53.520]  I mean, they're great supplements, they're great t-shirts, but you got to sell a lot of supplements and t-shirts, you know, to fight these people.
[03:37:53.639 --> 03:37:57.940]  Because it's not just the 16 million in defending ourselves the last six, seven years.
[03:37:58.540 --> 03:38:02.100]  We had to pay for the crew and the satellites and the servers and all the rest of the crap.
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:05.860]  I'm not saying the servers and crew and things are crap.
[03:38:05.959 --> 03:38:07.120]  I'm saying there's a lot of stuff here.
[03:38:07.979 --> 03:38:12.059]  So I've been in a damn war for you and my own family because I don't roll over to tyrants.
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:14.719]  And all I want you to do is keep me in a fight against these people.
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:17.100]  And I'll never surrender.
[03:38:18.239 --> 03:38:21.319]  But we need funds to beat them and we're...
[03:38:21.319 --> 03:38:26.899]  Fund-wise, we are a C-.
[03:38:27.579 --> 03:38:29.280]  Defeating globalists, we're a 100.
[03:38:29.500 --> 03:38:30.780]  And it's all God that gets the credit.
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:31.659]  But...
[03:38:32.579 --> 03:38:38.120]  By the way, this knife, limited edition, fundraiser, 1776 Devastator, sold out.
[03:38:38.239 --> 03:38:38.479]  It's gone.
[03:38:38.639 --> 03:38:38.979]  Took a week.
[03:38:39.420 --> 03:38:39.959]  Thank you.
[03:38:40.579 --> 03:38:42.459]  I told them to get more, but it's limited edition.
[03:38:42.559 --> 03:38:42.920]  That's it.
[03:38:43.319 --> 03:38:47.540]  With this baby, there might be another permutation, another limited edition with a different name, different look.
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:51.659]  But this is the kind of knife, I think, that does the business to defend yourself.
[03:38:51.780 --> 03:38:52.620]  I mean, I don't think this is...
[03:38:52.620 --> 03:38:53.860]  This is a real war blade right here.
[03:38:54.079 --> 03:38:55.520]  This is what does the business.
[03:38:55.879 --> 03:38:58.020]  Remake the U.S. Army trench weapon, modern edition.
[03:38:59.010 --> 03:39:03.670]  This is a super custom knife by one of the top custom knife makers in the country, dmonives.com.
[03:39:03.989 --> 03:39:05.690]  There are 550 of these.
[03:39:05.850 --> 03:39:06.790]  It's the answer 1984.
[03:39:07.850 --> 03:39:15.110]  Blade, with my signature, this is a super custom, super steel breacher, battle axe of a knife.
[03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.989]  It doesn't get tougher.
[03:39:16.090 --> 03:39:16.829]  It doesn't get stronger.
[03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:17.870]  It doesn't get harder to break.
[03:39:18.030 --> 03:39:19.309]  It doesn't get more razor sharp.
[03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:23.649]  There's only less than 100 of these left at dmonives.com.
[03:39:23.709 --> 03:39:26.870]  That's the URL. You can't get it at theallowshownstore.com.
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:28.639]  Let's just put a lower third up there.
[03:39:28.819 --> 03:39:31.020]  D-M-O-Knives.com.
[03:39:31.559 --> 03:39:36.479]  Just D-M-O-Knives.com.
[03:39:36.879 --> 03:39:37.500]  One word.
[03:39:38.479 --> 03:39:39.940]  D-M-O-Knives.com.
[03:39:40.120 --> 03:39:42.540]  That's why I earlier wanted to get to you already, but it's okay.
[03:39:43.239 --> 03:39:45.500]  D-M-O-Knives.com.
[03:39:46.620 --> 03:39:49.239]  And the CMOS is amazing.
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:51.719]  The other products are amazing.
[03:39:52.659 --> 03:39:56.760]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:39:57.239 --> 03:40:00.180]  And, hell, I'll write it out on a piece of paper.
[03:40:00.319 --> 03:40:00.819]  Watch this.
[03:40:00.819 --> 03:40:02.700]  I got low tech for you, baby.
[03:40:03.180 --> 03:40:03.799]  Oh, yeah.
[03:40:04.139 --> 03:40:05.219]  I'm not going to get...
[03:40:05.219 --> 03:40:05.520]  There you go.
[03:40:05.860 --> 03:40:06.879]  dmonives.com.
[03:40:07.479 --> 03:40:08.860]  And I imagine they'll be gone today.
[03:40:09.040 --> 03:40:19.940]  And it takes a lot of knives and a lot of t-shirts and a lot of CMARS to take on the Democratic Party at Point Blank Range and kick the living hell out of their ass in the info war, nonviolently politically.
[03:40:21.669 --> 03:40:22.930]  So, you did it.
[03:40:23.049 --> 03:40:24.309]  You're the reason we're still here.
[03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:26.409]  I want to thank you.
[03:40:26.729 --> 03:40:28.069]  I want to thank God.
[03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:28.790]  It's amazing.
[03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:32.149]  The War Room with Owen Schroer coming up can easily be our last day in this building.
[03:40:33.579 --> 03:40:39.440]  But I'm going to get a court order on the sale first because I'm not going to have that trick, you know, played again.
[03:40:39.579 --> 03:40:40.700]  I didn't get fooled the first time.
[03:40:40.819 --> 03:40:41.840]  You know, fool me once, shame on you.
[03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:42.959]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[03:40:43.079 --> 03:40:44.420]  Well, I didn't get fooled the first time.
[03:40:44.819 --> 03:40:46.239]  So I'm not going to get fooled the second time.
[03:40:46.379 --> 03:40:48.040]  I don't know how long we're going to be here in this building.
[03:40:48.139 --> 03:40:49.579]  I don't know if people are going to buy it.
[03:40:49.780 --> 03:40:50.260]  Just pray.
[03:40:50.760 --> 03:40:52.600]  But this whole thing is up in the air.
[03:40:52.940 --> 03:40:54.739]  The War Room with Owen Schroeder coming up right now.
[03:40:55.040 --> 03:40:56.280]  Follow us on Real Alex Jones.
[03:40:56.559 --> 03:40:58.219]  God bless you all and thanks for the support.
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:40:59.680]  You're the reason we're having so much success.
[03:41:00.690 --> 03:41:05.090]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the big moment of truth is here.
[03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:09.829]  I'm taping this as an emergency message on Friday, November 8th in the evening.
[03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:23.790]  And in just a few days, next Wednesday, November 13th, by order of a federal judge, InfoWars is being sold to auction and the bad guys say they're going to buy it to turn it off and try to take me off air.
[03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:29.610]  Well, even if they shut down this building and take the website InfoWars away, I'm the Infowar.
[03:41:29.709 --> 03:41:30.510]  You're the Infowar.
[03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:31.670]  The crew is the Infowar.
[03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:33.489]  Our work is the Infowar.
[03:41:33.649 --> 03:41:36.829]  The globalist plan was deliberately trying to make us poor.
[03:41:36.930 --> 03:41:37.389]  They admit that.
[03:41:37.450 --> 03:41:37.989]  The Great Reset.
[03:41:38.549 --> 03:41:42.010]  That's why just a few days after his president-elect, Bitcoin's way up.
[03:41:42.069 --> 03:41:42.950]  The stock market's way up.
[03:41:43.049 --> 03:41:48.409]  All these companies are announcing they're moving back to the US. Russia says they're not going to try to dethrone the dollar anymore.
[03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:52.989]  So now, it's more important than ever that we stay on air.
[03:41:53.549 --> 03:42:00.010]  And the only way we can stay on air In the face of all this tyranny, is if you support us.
[03:42:00.549 --> 03:42:11.569]  So when you go to thealexjonesstore.com, incredible supplements, great patriot apparel, amazing collectible knives, it's all there.
[03:42:12.090 --> 03:42:27.030]  But we've come out with three fundraiser items that are limited edition, that do have markup in them, so that instead of selling a t-shirt, and we end up making like 10 bucks on it, And it doesn't, at the end of the day, bring in enough funds.
[03:42:27.629 --> 03:42:33.989]  Just like NPR will have a fundraiser to promote their communism and globalism, and a coffee cup probably costs them six, seven bucks.
[03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:38.149]  When they sell it for a hundred, you know it's not worth that.
[03:42:38.270 --> 03:42:39.149]  It's a fundraiser.
[03:42:39.370 --> 03:42:43.049]  You're getting the memento that you supported their new order agenda.
[03:42:43.889 --> 03:42:45.190]  Well, you don't want to do that.
[03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:47.229]  You want to support what we're doing.
[03:42:47.469 --> 03:42:51.670]  So we have these three great limited edition posters.
[03:42:53.329 --> 03:43:03.110]  Two of them are about InfoWars and celebrating its history and what we've done, whether it survives or not, and just remembering all we've gone through together and ensuring that we continue to fight on the future.
[03:43:03.329 --> 03:43:10.709]  And the other is an Alex Jones-style InfoWars crew, kind of Star Wars spoof spinoff.
[03:43:11.250 --> 03:43:14.329]  And they're all great to hang in your office, great to hang in your house.
[03:43:15.639 --> 03:43:16.579]  They're limited edition.
[03:43:16.760 --> 03:43:17.840]  They're pieces of history.
[03:43:18.219 --> 03:43:23.940]  And so when you get them for $50, it costs us to print it and put it in the tube and all that like seven or eight bucks.
[03:43:24.200 --> 03:43:27.500]  We get some real funds in for operations.
[03:43:27.500 --> 03:43:30.100]  So I can tell you there's only a few thousand of each one of these posters.
[03:43:30.819 --> 03:43:37.659]  If you get them, I will have the funds to operate for a few months.
[03:43:38.700 --> 03:43:43.659]  As it stands right now, we've only got the funds to really get about a month or so launched.
[03:43:44.799 --> 03:43:46.020]  So I need your help.
[03:43:46.739 --> 03:43:49.020]  Our work is the most important it's ever been right now.
[03:43:49.139 --> 03:43:50.020]  These are great posters.
[03:43:50.719 --> 03:43:52.979]  I'm asking the Infowars family to stand with us.
[03:43:53.059 --> 03:43:55.520]  You've done so much in the past at the most critical of times.
[03:43:55.659 --> 03:43:59.739]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get one or more of these posters.
[03:43:59.860 --> 03:44:01.700]  And I humbly, respectfully thank you for your support.
[03:44:01.879 --> 03:44:03.719]  But I gotta tell you, they are good-looking posters.
[03:44:03.860 --> 03:44:08.180]  I mean, the Star Wars spinoff spoof is fun, but I designed the...
[03:44:09.220 --> 03:44:12.680]  InfoWars, red and white on black designs.
[03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:15.600]  One says 1776 worldwide.
[03:44:16.280 --> 03:44:19.440]  2024, Alex Jones with my signature.
[03:44:19.659 --> 03:44:21.879]  The other says InfoWars lives forever with my signature.
[03:44:22.180 --> 03:44:24.360]  These are really great looking posters.
[03:44:24.559 --> 03:44:27.639]  They're iconic and the tyrants hate InfoWars.
[03:44:27.719 --> 03:44:28.620]  They hate the idea of it.
[03:44:29.049 --> 03:44:30.469]  And it will live on regardless.
[03:44:30.809 --> 03:44:32.229]  So I thank those that have supported.
[03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:34.170]  I ask those that have supported to support again.
[03:44:34.290 --> 03:44:35.250]  And those that have been on the fence.
[03:44:35.370 --> 03:44:37.010]  Maybe you shared articles, videos, you're a fan.
[03:44:37.329 --> 03:44:38.190]  What are you doing?
[03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:39.690]  This is history happening.
[03:44:39.930 --> 03:44:41.170]  We're turning the tide.
[03:44:41.329 --> 03:44:42.069]  We have the initiative.
[03:44:42.069 --> 03:44:43.149]  We're starting to win.
[03:44:43.989 --> 03:44:45.709]  We've won major battles, but not the war.
[03:44:46.010 --> 03:44:52.989]  So go now to thealexjohnstore.com and get one of these historic posters and keep us on the air one way or another.
[03:44:53.450 --> 03:44:54.290]  I thank you.
[03:44:54.530 --> 03:44:56.049]  And now I ask you to take action.
[03:44:56.350 --> 03:44:56.750]  God bless.
