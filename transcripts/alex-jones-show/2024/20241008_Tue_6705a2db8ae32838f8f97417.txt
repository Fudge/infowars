[00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:17.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, October 8th, 2024 transmission.
[00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:29.730]  We are 27 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes to the most important election in world history.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.119]  Alright, I did a lot of research and a lot of preparation in the last 30 years for what I'm going to be covering today.
[00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:45.179]  And I've sent the crew over 20 clips, and I've got over 100 documents right here.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:00.340]  And coming up, at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to do a big presentation for everybody on what's really going on with weather weapons.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.099]  And I'm going to show you the admitted father of weather weapons.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.200]  Just search his name, Ben Livingston, father of weather weapons.
[00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.680]  In fact, we ought to put an article on that, Fox News, CNN, from about 2007.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.239]  And I was the first to interview him.
[00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.819]  A listener sent me a link when they declassified it, and he hadn't met on the news yet.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.680]  So I called him. He lived in Lubbock.
[00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.180]  He was 90-something years old then, still very sharp.
[00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:37.719]  He was in World War II and then right through to the 90s commanding Air Force operations for weather control.
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980]  One of the longest serving people in Air Force history.
[00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:48.599]  And he came to Austin and I interviewed him for two days and showed all the documents that were suddenly not secret.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.519]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.400]  He got a visit from the U.S. government a week later and told me he was not allowed to talk to me anymore.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.439]  So, we have that information for you.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:10.479]  And I'm going to tee it up for 30 minutes from now, bottom of the hour, and I'm going to go over all of it here today.
[00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.240]  And I have congressional testimony concerning all this.
[00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.919]  I have the UN Treaty on Weather Modification and Control from 1977.
[00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.860]  I have the US Public Law from 1976.
[00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.520]  And these are all from.gov.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:37.000]  So I'm going to show you all the official U.S. government documents, National Science Foundation, Special Commission on Weather Modification.
[00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:53.219]  I'm going to show you the Stanford Research Certification in the late 60s that the Pentagon, in association with the Department of Energy, could completely control hurricanes, could create them,
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.240]  strengthen them, kill them, steer them, turn them, control them.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:13.759]  And then we have the bold headlines that I put up on X that the Kamala Harris, the Biden-Harris administration, is in control of this hurricane.
[00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.560]  Now, how do I know that?
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.030]  Well, if you've got a local fire department and there's, say, a 10-story building on fire, And the fire department just decides to not respond.
[00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.150]  They made the decision to let it burn, and they controlled the situation by deciding to let it burn.
[00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:46.990]  So they have the power certified easily with just five or six big aircraft, and that's the old technology, not the lasers that are all certified, and the Doppler radar they also have on ships and large oil drilling platforms that they've launched.
[00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.050]  They can totally just make this thing stop and dump the water in the ocean.
[00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.090]  And on 9-11, the hurricane was going to hit, remember, in 2001.
[00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.389]  But that meteorologist never saw anything like it.
[00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.710]  It just turned away from the coast and went away because that was going to get in the way of some of the stuff that Deep State was up to.
[00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.430]  We've got a big broadcast for you today.
[00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.830]  I've got a lot of news I'm going to cover in the meantime before we do that.
[00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.850]  Stay with us. Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, October 8th, 2024.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.819]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.240]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.500]  The election is 27 days away.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.720]  The deep state is in high gear trying to suppress conservative voting blocs in the United States.
[00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:39.100]  State Department's busy stealing elections and trying to block elections of populists around the world.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.500]  We've got a lot of news on that.
[00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:50.860]  Elon Musk did another powerful two-hour long devastating to the deep state interview with the great Tucker Carlson yesterday.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.220]  We have amazing excerpts of that.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:06.420]  We have an incredible interview that Kamala Harris did obviously on 60 Minutes where she screwed the pooch royally and looked like a deer in the headlights that has been run over.
[00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.569]  We have big developments, obviously, with ongoing expansions of war in the Middle East.
[00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:28.250]  We have not just one witness, but multiple ones, including the FBI director, inadvertently against himself, telling people on July 13th that Trump was not shot at.
[00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.610]  And the witnesses are saying they were interviewed, and the FBI said, you didn't see that, he fell down.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.500]  They were trying to cover it up that first eight hours and maybe just decide to gaslight people into not believing.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.980]  I remember Forbes and AP and others said he wasn't shot the first hour, first six, seven, eight hours.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.160]  And then Google for months wouldn't even say that there'd been attempted assassination, wouldn't even show the image.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:06:00.620]  They really tried to make you have amnesia like in Men in Black where they hold up the little device that erases your memory, your short-term memory, your short-term memories.
[00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.470]  But it didn't work. Kind of like, Harris, I'm the border czar.
[00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:06.829]  I was never the border czar.
[00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.189]  That's insane. I'm going to ban fracking days later.
[00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.029]  I never said that. You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.009]  I want to take all your semi-automatic guns.
[00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:17.689]  I don't want to take your semi-automatic guns.
[00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.529]  That's insane. So...
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:42.000]  We're good to go.
[00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:50.279]  It's just the ongoing psychological gaslighting to the term that is going on.
[00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.959]  And boy, Harris stumbles after CBS calls her out for stealing Biden's delegates.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.279]  He were handed the nomination, no primary, no votes.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.319]  That's not how our system is intended to work.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.459]  While the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.019]  We got that clip.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:28.050]  Coming up. Now, at the bottom of the hour, 33 after, in 23 minutes, we come out of that break, I am going to judiciously, but as quickly as I can,
[00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:34.329]  lay out what's really happening with the last two hurricanes.
[00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.529]  Helen and Milton.
[00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:40.930]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.629]  We can put up the live show Feed from X if we can, because I wrote that headline right before I went live.
[00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:46.230]  I want to show it to people.
[00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:58.990]  And I make the point that the government is in control of these hurricanes.
[00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:14.199]  I'm going to explain in a moment. We exclusively lay out the smoking gun Government documents proving feds have had the power to completely control hurricanes since 1967.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:23.459]  The Pentagon slash Department of Energy is in control of Hurricane Milton, one of the most powerful storms in history, set to devastate Florida Wednesday.
[00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.079]  Now, how do I say that?
[00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.079]  And I'll lay it all out at the bottom of the hour and show the proof.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:51.120]  More than 15 years ago, you can look at the date of the Ben Livingston interview, a listener called into the show and said they just declassified today, and I got a bunch of emails, that the Pentagon certified by the late 60s total control of hurricanes.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:04.820]  And the man that directed the weather weapon project for the Air Force from World War II Through Vietnam, and then was still a consultant and worked for the Pentagon into his 90s.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:24.379]  Ben Livingston, who led squadrons over Vietnam and Operation Popeye, flooding the Ho Chi Minh Trail, had complete control of hurricanes by the late 1960s, certified by the Pentagon and Stanford Research Institute at Stanford.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.659]  Total control.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.639]  Now that was just with cloud seeding.
[00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:45.169]  Now with the electromagnetic systems they've got, and with lasers, and I'll show you mainstream news admitting that, they have total control beyond even what they had then.
[00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:52.470]  They can create hurricanes, create tornadoes, steer them, make them stronger, make them weaker, kill them, whatever they want.
[00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.570]  So if they have that power, why do we have record hurricanes?
[00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.730]  And they're saying Milton may break all the records, already is.
[00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.049]  They become a first Cat 6.
[00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:09.730]  It's been back and forth Cat 5 to the strongest level, 180 miles an hour as of yesterday.
[00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:12.129]  Now it's slowed down to 150 right now.
[00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.850]  They say it's going to speed back up as it hits Florida, western Florida, the most conservative areas.
[00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.210]  So again, if the fire department...
[00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:30.200]  It has a, say, eight-story building in downtown, and it's on fire.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.399]  And they can put it out with six, seven engines.
[00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.860]  But they decide to not go put it out.
[00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:39.120]  You would say the fire department helped burn that building down.
[00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:42.460]  The fire department made the decision to not control it.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.299]  So that was a form of control in not controlling it.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:58.320]  It's the same thing. If you leave your one-year-old baby in the backyard by the pool, and you go inside to Take a nap.
[00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.259]  There's a good chance your kid's going to drown.
[00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.039]  You've killed your kid.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.460]  So I'm going to explain it.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.120]  Everybody debates whether it's a weather weapon or not.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.259]  They are constantly manipulating these things.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:24.539]  And you've got all the flights that are confirmed with the big weather control planes in Helena and now in Milton.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.059]  The flight paths are public.
[00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:35.259]  I'll show you those. And it's the classic flight paths where they go and they spray on the edge and turn it and they go inside to speed it up and go in circles and put out different chemicals.
[00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:41.360]  And you've got them leading Helena right in and right up into the key areas they wanted to flood.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.340]  The most conservative areas of the South just went all over them perfectly.
[00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:48.610]  dumping NOAA level, you know, floods on them.
[00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.190]  So I'll get into all this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.269]  And then now the same thing's happening with Milton.
[00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:58.529]  So this is going on and they treat us like children.
[00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.659]  And just go, oh, you know, they had all these articles about me the last few days.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.080]  Oh, Alex Jones, he's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:09.799]  He says they're flooding everything for lithium.
[00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:11.519]  No, I'm not the one saying that.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.519]  Everybody else is. And yeah, of course, the land grab for the disasters.
[00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.820]  They always, that's a side issue.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.399]  That's like a dessert.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:27.799]  That's gravy. It's about wrecking the West Coast, the panhandle of Florida, which both storms are, the first one did, and the second one's going to be even worse, they're saying.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.600]  And Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and other key areas.
[00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.220]  So they can't vote.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.019]  And I've got Axelrod and other Democrats saying this is great.
[00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.580]  This could hand North Carolina and maybe even Georgia to us.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.419]  So, I mean, you want to play the clips?
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.899]  I've already played them days ago. And I said the first couple days, look, this is going to hurt conservative voters in rural areas.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.019]  Because it's easy to get the cities back up.
[00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:53.659]  It's hard to get the rural areas back up.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.100]  Especially in the mountains. So it's all there.
[00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:17.720]  So, if I leave a big platter, a big pan of grease on my range, and I fill it to the top with Crisco, and then I turn it on high, and I'll get in the car and say I'm going to church,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.860]  when the house burns down, the fire department's going to probably get me charged for arson, for insurance fraud, because they're going to say, well, how the hell did you leave a whole thing of grease on here?
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:35.820]  Oh, I just forgot. So, they can control these hurricanes certified late 1960s.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.279]  I'll show you the documents. The father of weather weapons.
[00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.399]  Just type in Ben Livingston father of weather weapons.
[00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:42.860]  I'll show it all to you.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.440]  And you have to understand that.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.139]  Because they'll be like, oh, he says they're in control of these.
[00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:53.220]  Obviously, they spun them up or controlling them.
[00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:57.100]  They're record level. They're attacking with precision exactly where they want.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:11.659]  And the Pentagon and the CIA brag how they've done this all over the world to other people, including during elections they flooded people.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.139]  Did you know that? I've got those articles.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.279]  So, they've got the capacity, they've done it before, they're obsessed with it.
[00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:27.769]  I'm going to show you the CIA director admitting it all on C-SPAN. And then you're going to read articles everywhere today and tomorrow.
[00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.929]  Jones blames the hurricanes on the Biden-Harris administration.
[00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:34.409]  And, I mean, they're in control.
[00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:45.929]  They're not blocking it. They could have, according to Ben Livingston, with old technology, 1960s technology, five big aircraft, and they could go to the biggest hurricane.
[00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.309]  And he's flown into typhoons, by the way.
[00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:51.330]  Those are even faster.
[00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.730]  They spin the other direction in the Pacific.
[00:14:56.199 --> 00:15:05.000]  He, in its own record, it's been declassified, said with five aircraft, he could kill any hurricane, and he did over and over again.
[00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:07.700]  And that was the early step of the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:22.840]  Then they got the project, he talks about it all, an hour-long interview with me, several of them, to steer them and They had their math, they had their meteorologist,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.299]  they had their info, and very quickly they were like, this is easy.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.679]  We can speed them up, we can slow them down, we can turn them, we can kill them, and we can make them.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.220]  We can make them.
[00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:35.379]  Now you're going to see him say all that.
[00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:49.299]  You understand? So I'm just giving you a prelude right now of what's coming up.
[00:15:52.659 --> 00:16:00.840]  Now, you might want to take the live links at RealAlexJonesOnX and InfoWars and at InfoWars.com forward slash show and band.video.
[00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:07.360]  And you might want to share those with people so they can actually tune in.
[00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:15.610]  And once we archive this from the live show, once we cut it out and post it, I suggest you share it.
[00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:18.149]  Because you see all this overhead shot, please.
[00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:20.309]  You see all these stacks right here?
[00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.129]  These are UN documents, US government documents, congressional reports.
[00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:28.690]  This is all admitted right here.
[00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:31.929]  Stack after stack after stack.
[00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:34.429]  And you can go search anything you see here.
[00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:43.730]  And you can go, read the reports on the U.S. government's own websites, on the U.N.'s website, and you can look at it with your own eyeballs.
[00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:55.950]  So, Livingston ran Operation Popeye, Storm Fury, Controlling Hurricanes.
[00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:04.509]  It's all right there. So, just like they're blocking aid to the ravaged conservative areas, admitting they don't want...
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.660]  Voting to be back in time with 27 days.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.819]  And just like Mayorkas said, sorry, no money for you.
[00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:13.480]  We give a billion bucks to illegal aliens.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:22.019]  Now they just caught them, even Fox is reporting it, with $7 billion slush fund that FEMA has.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.980]  Yeah, Mayorkas is out to get us, folks.
[00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:42.349]  So, it's all coming up today.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:18:00.519]  Now, I'm going to go ahead and start getting into must-sum now, then we'll go to break in about nine minutes, and come back, and I'm going to, as quickly as I can, go through all this.
[00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:08.460]  I have Rodney Howard Brown, who's a great pastor, has the biggest church there in the Tampa area, joining us at the start of the next hour to give us an update on what they're expecting there.
[00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.559]  Tampa rarely actually gets hit directly because of the topography and the way the weather works, but...
[00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.670]  We're going to be discussing that with him and then moving back into all of this.
[00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.769]  And I intend to open the phones up for all of you as well.
[00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:29.829]  But I am going to have to later...
[00:18:29.829 --> 00:18:32.150]  This Musk interview is just powerful.
[00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.430]  He explains the death cult and why they want us to hate ourselves so they can control our lives and make us give up and be slaves.
[00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.890]  He says it's team humanity versus team death.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:56.420]  This is massive. And then we've got him talking about Bill Gates and how there's these globalists that are using the sex rings and how the deep state is the Epstein list.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.559]  Let's go ahead and play clip 15 first.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:06.660]  Here it is. But she'll just say whatever words are on the teleprompter.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.400]  So, you know, it's really whoever controls the teleprompter is the actual sort of...
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.619]  That's who's actually in charge.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.099]  And who is that, do you think?
[00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:16.599]  Well, I've tried to put it down.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.200]  It's not like any one kind of mastermind.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.039]  It's not like... It seems to be...
[00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:26.000]  It's like Kamala's sort of a marionette with...
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.140]  You know, a thousand puppet masters type of thing.
[00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:38.500]  It's somewhere north of a hundred is what it seems like.
[00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:41.200]  Yes. I bet you know 80 of them.
[00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:44.180]  I probably know most of them, yeah.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:51.299]  Yeah. So, I mean, just by virtue of your job and what you've been doing for the last 30 years, I mean, you just...
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.920]  And I should say, I think you voted for Biden.
[00:19:55.119 --> 00:20:00.619]  I'd like to see a matchup of those called the top 100 puppet masters on the FD client list.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.099]  Do you think there's some overlap?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.140]  Strong overlap. Strong overlap.
[00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.019]  When are we going to see that list, do you think?
[00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:15.299]  I don't know. It's mind-blowing that they've not tried to prosecute even one.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.859]  Not even the worst offender on the FD client list.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.400]  They've not even tried to prosecute even one.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.680]  That's insane. Well, because they have a lot of diabetic grandmothers who were outside the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:38.119]  They're kind of occupied. Yeah, I mean, they've put, like, whatever, 500 or 600 January 6th protesters in prison and not one person on the F-10 client list.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.039]  Will that ever come out, do you think?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:51.599]  You know, I think part of why Kamala's getting so much support is that if Trump wins, that F-10 client list is going to become public.
[00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:56.869]  Yes. And some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome.
[00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.549]  Yeah. Do you think Reid Hoffman's uncomfortable?
[00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.849]  Yes. And Gates.
[00:21:03.349 --> 00:21:04.529]  And Gates. Yeah.
[00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:10.170]  And I only ask that because you just look at them and you're like, that's a nervous person right there.
[00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.130]  I don't know. I mean, I assume you know them.
[00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:16.269]  Yeah. Yes. Reid Hoffman was my vice president of business development at PayPal.
[00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.349]  Yeah. 24 years ago.
[00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.089]  Look how far we've come.
[00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:28.230]  Everything we talked about decades ago is now mainstream news.
[00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.009]  And Elon Musk is reaching a billion people a day now.
[00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.250]  Literally just devastating the enemy.
[00:21:35.609 --> 00:21:45.549]  Praise God. Thank you, God. And thank you for all the people that spread the word across this country and the world about the new world order so that we understand it's team human versus team demon.
[00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.089]  It's team God versus team Satan.
[00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:50.380]  Now, he talks about this a long time.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.579]  He's going to play a short clip of it, but the full clips on Infowars.com.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.059]  But here he is talking about why they're so anti-life.
[00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:57.900]  Here's Elon Musk. So let me just address those in order.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.279]  So the first is you say we need more people and not commit civilizational suicide.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.220]  It does seem like the U.S. government, if you take three steps back, is pretty committed to making fewer Americans.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.200]  Yeah. There's a lot of anti-fertility propaganda.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:17.299]  A lot. Actually, that seems like their main sort of domestic social policy is convincing you not to have kids.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:23.650]  What is that? I mean, that's certainly part of civilizational suicide.
[00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:33.849]  The environmental movement in the extreme is fundamentally misanthropic and anti-human.
[00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:39.710]  They start seeing humans as a plague, a blight on the surface of the earth.
[00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:44.130]  That earth would be this paradise if only the humans weren't here.
[00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:46.849]  And some people actually say this explicitly.
[00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.569]  There's the Extinctionist Society that is literally...
[00:22:51.569 --> 00:23:01.430]  This guy who's the head of the Extinctionist Society was on the front page of the New York Times quoted as saying, there are 8 billion people in the world, it would be better if there were none.
[00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:07.150]  So there's some people who actually say that explicitly, which isn't completely insane.
[00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.869]  He's advocating a Holocaust war of humanity.
[00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:15.799]  To utter madness, he should be condemned for such a statement, but he wasn't for some reason.
[00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:21.619]  Now, most people on the sort of environmental movement have that implicitly.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.599]  They don't realize that they have that as their organization.
[00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:27.259]  All right, so if you want to stop the global agenda, you have to understand this.
[00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:28.319]  He goes on for like 10 minutes.
[00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:32.339]  We're going to air it later after I hit the weaponization of the weather, the fact they could kill the hurricanes.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.099]  Instead, they're obviously turbocharging them.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.720]  And we have the flights. We have the evidence.
[00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.440]  We know what's going on. I'll break it down next segment.
[00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.029]  But that's why this broadcast is so important.
[00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.190]  That's why you're so important.
[00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:43.410]  We're changing the world together.
[00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:46.730]  And we make it easier for you to support us at this critical time.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.460]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and this.
[00:23:50.759 --> 00:24:04.779]  I'm more excited about this product than anything we put out in 10 years except X2 and X3. Just the iodine in this is super bioavailable and has all these other key trace elements and things in it that is amazing.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.799]  CMOS, this particular type, is known to be incredible.
[00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:09.079]  It's the hottest thing.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.619]  This is one of the top developers and companies in the country that we were able to private label this through so you're not going to get better.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.799]  It's 40% off via three bottles, even more.
[00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:22.420]  Out of the gates.
[00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.470]  They have combo deals. They have three-pack deals.
[00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.890]  It is at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.910]  Every action in your body must have iodine.
[00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:36.670]  This has some of the most bioavailable, best in the world, plus all these other super nutrients in it.
[00:24:36.849 --> 00:24:38.230]  It is incredible.
[00:24:38.369 --> 00:24:40.690]  I love it. I've been on it for over a month.
[00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.329]  You can see the difference in me.
[00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.269]  It is insanely good.
[00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.710]  And the gummies taste great.
[00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:47.009]  Their concentrates of it.
[00:24:48.089 --> 00:24:50.190]  Ultimate sea moss.
[00:24:52.809 --> 00:24:55.589]  At thealexjonesstore.com exclusively.
[00:24:56.089 --> 00:25:15.589]  And there's all the great t-shirts and all the great hoodies and all the great ball caps with our sponsor that no matter what happens to InfoWars, and it's supporting InfoWars big time right now, has pledged to commit to keep us up on air with a new operation and we're trying to get the capital in to be sure the crew is there so we can be as effective as we've always been,
[00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:17.809]  maybe more effective. And people are starting to come through.
[00:25:17.869 --> 00:25:20.480]  I want to thank you all. There's a limited run of these.
[00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:22.480]  They'll get more in a few weeks, but they're going to sell out quickly.
[00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:26.599]  Thealexjonesstore.com is the coordinates to get these great products.
[00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:33.440]  Ultimate CMOS, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:41.430]  And when you go there, again, they also have an ultimate green food that's way better than Athletic Greens that's, by the way, excellent.
[00:25:41.589 --> 00:25:46.109]  It's even better, even stronger, similar formula, but even better, and you get more of it for the price.
[00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.730]  One bag of Athletic Greens is like $100.
[00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:54.009]  This is way under that, and it's more of it, and it's better if you actually look at all the ingredients and where they're sourced.
[00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.430]  I'm not knocking AG Greens.
[00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.509]  It's the best-selling thing in the country.
[00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.930]  I was taking AG Greens, so we got these.
[00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:02.490]  I was also taking our green sprouts from drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:12.000]  It's excellent. But Optimal Human is also available and has a great starter pack and all the rest of it in the bottle to shake it up in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.819]  I also want to thank everybody that's been donating to our legal defense.
[00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:17.200]  That's beyond critical. The enemy's attacking us from all sides.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.640]  You're the reason we're still on air.
[00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:20.339]  Thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:22.920]  Go to realalexjones.com to donate.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.519]  I want to thank all those that did.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.500]  realalexjones.com to donate.
[00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:31.000]  The Alex Jones Store for the Ultimate CMOS and all the other great products.
[00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.430]  One of the biggest hurricanes and most powerful ever.
[00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:45.190]  Category 5 yesterday slowed to Category 4.
[00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:47.809]  They're saying it's going to speed back up to 5.
[00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.069]  They hope back down to 3.
[00:26:49.769 --> 00:26:52.809]  Making landfall just south of Tampa Wednesday.
[00:26:54.089 --> 00:26:56.109]  It was up to 180 miles an hour yesterday.
[00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.789]  It's 130 miles an hour right now.
[00:26:58.289 --> 00:27:01.390]  It has trillions of gallons of water in it.
[00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:03.029]  Now, I'm going to state a fact.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.539]  And then I'm going to lay it out.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:13.779]  The U.S. government, secretly by 65, had certified that they had total control of hurricanes and typhoons.
[00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:19.220]  By 67, the Pentagon confirmed it and certified it.
[00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:27.859]  And in 69, the program was taken from Ben Livingston, who we're going to show you clubs of, that I interviewed first.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.059]  He's been on Fox News, you name it.
[00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:38.630]  Running weather operations in World War II at the end, right through Vietnam and being a consultant into his 90s for the Pentagon.
[00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:48.829]  He led squadrons in Operation Storm Fury controlling hurricanes and Operation Popeye in Vietnam.
[00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.410]  We've posted it before.
[00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:52.690]  We're going to repost it to X today.
[00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.789]  It's called Infowars Weather Wars Report.
[00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:58.650]  It's an hour-long documentary with Livingston.
[00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.970]  Also interviewed him for two hours on radio.
[00:28:01.289 --> 00:28:04.910]  We're going to dig that out and repost it to X. I just thought of that.
[00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:15.069]  One week after he went back to Lubbock from flying here with his wife to be interviewed by me, I called him and he said, I can't talk to you.
[00:28:15.089 --> 00:28:17.150]  Got a visit from high up U.S. government.
[00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.890]  And even though it's classified, they told me not to talk to you or anybody else anymore.
[00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.329]  He did a Fox interview before he got that visit.
[00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.230]  So I interviewed him first. Fox interviewed him a few days later.
[00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.890]  And then never talked to again.
[00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:34.470]  And he's in the documents that were declassified as the commander of it.
[00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:39.609]  He was the first person to ever fly into a typhoon in 1945.
[00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:43.420]  And cloud seeded.
[00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:50.059]  So, I'm going to play excerpts of that and more.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:58.759]  I'm going to show you the U.N. documents, the U.S. government documents, the Storm Fury documents that are on the government website,.gov, U.S. gov.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:08.180]  I'm going to show you the CIA director admitting it, Bill Gates admitting it, all of it.
[00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.140]  Now, here's the key, and I'll go through all the evidence.
[00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:24.789]  It is a fact the U.S. government can create hurricanes, kill hurricanes, make them bigger, make them smaller, make them turn left, make them turn right, make them stop, make them, they can control them like a joystick.
[00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.250]  And we have the confirmed flights by the Department of Energy who's over this.
[00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:33.009]  NOAA just monitors the weather.
[00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:35.150]  Department of Energy with the Pentagon runs the programs.
[00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.410]  I'll show you all the documents. Since the 40s.
[00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:43.490]  And they're in control.
[00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.690]  Whether they're messing with it or not, they could kill it.
[00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.890]  And the power to kill something is the power to control it.
[00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.089]  Now, obviously, we have the flights.
[00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:56.089]  We show the planes going in, steering it.
[00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.230]  You see the flights move.
[00:29:57.349 --> 00:30:00.230]  They're controlling it. And that's with the old technology.
[00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.430]  Then they've got the lasers.
[00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:06.269]  Then they've got the ground radar they can ionize it with.
[00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.009]  I have all the newscast on that.
[00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:18.170]  And today I'm covering it, but tonight or so, by tomorrow, I'm going to get in the studio, the little studio, because it'll take two hours.
[00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:22.009]  And I'm going to show you 50-plus clips I've got.
[00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:25.549]  I'm going to make a statement, show you the document, show you the news and video.
[00:30:27.589 --> 00:30:30.430]  So, again, you see my headlines.
[00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.529]  I'm going to be attacked for that.
[00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.869]  Jones says government in control of it.
[00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:35.589]  They are. The evidence is they're manipulating it.
[00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.430]  But even if you remove that evidence, they're letting it hit.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:46.900]  They cannot deny that they could kill it in the Gulf of Mexico with five aircraft in the 1960s.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.140]  And they got all sorts of ships out there with these high-powered radar control systems.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.099]  You can pull up, you know, Associated Press.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.059]  Dubai making the desert green with Doppler radar.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.759]  China making it rain with Doppler radar.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.319]  Trillion-watt lasers.
[00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:10.250]  So... They control these things.
[00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.210]  That's a fact. They'll gaslight you and say, oh no, no, no.
[00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.150]  They'll tell you Kamala Harris isn't against fracking or doesn't want your guns even though she does.
[00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.829]  They'll say Trump didn't get shot.
[00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.390]  They're back on the news saying that.
[00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.730]  They'll tell you two men can have a baby and there aren't X and Y chromosomes.
[00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.789]  They're lying to you. So as this thing barrels forward, understand that.
[00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:35.809]  Now the first thing I want to play, and you ought to go to the C-SPAN archives and watch the whole thing.
[00:31:35.829 --> 00:31:37.569]  This is 1995 Robert Fletcher.
[00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:44.009]  Who did a great job coalescing the public documents then and warning the public and state legislatures.
[00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:45.410]  They were demonizing him in Congress.
[00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:50.650]  They were speechless when he brought up the U.S. Senate report that I have a copy of here from decades before.
[00:31:50.990 --> 00:32:05.230]  Also have the head of the Defense Department, William Cohen, in 1997, in a briefing at the Pentagon that was public, picked up by AP and Reuters, admitting the U.S. government controls the weather and has weather weapons and earthquake weapons.
[00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.990]  You want to see that? We got that.
[00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:12.849]  Got too much evidence. But they talk to you like your children and say this stuff doesn't exist.
[00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:18.210]  Alright, here is Robert Fletcher in front of Congress.
[00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:25.230]  Another question on the interview with the Los Angeles Times on April 21st.
[00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:40.279]  You said that the You told the Associated Press that the American government has created weather-tampering techniques so that the New World Order will be able to starve millions of Americans and to control the rest.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.619]  Would you explain what you were trying to say?
[00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:47.079]  Well, what I was trying to say is exactly what I said.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.299]  There is weather control techniques.
[00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:55.839]  We have a complete package on that, which I did not bring, but I certainly will see to it that it is brought in for the record.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.779]  Number one, the entire patents on the equipment.
[00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:08.799]  Number two, Senator Claiborne Pell's complete statement and story of his own that not only does it exist, that we even utilize it as far back as the Vietnam War.
[00:33:14.199 --> 00:34:01.829]  You're saying the government has created weather-tampering techniques so that the, quote, new world order We'll be able to starve millions of Americans worldwide millions of Americans and to control the rest yes sir and that's my belief as bizarre as that sounds when if somebody had told me that that equipment even existed 10 years ago I would have thought they were nuts sir and at this point in time we have all the documents to prove it and if you think that 85 to I would say that weather wars,
[00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:11.170]  and this is quoting actually Senator Claiborne Pell himself, That they are the greatest weapon ever created in the world, and that's the senator's own statement.
[00:34:11.369 --> 00:34:12.650]  So yes, I do stand on that.
[00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.010]  Thank you, Mr. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr.
[00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:22.230]  Chairman. And of course, he then delivered to them, as he did on my show back then in studio, and as he did to the legislatures, huge binders of all the documents.
[00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.110]  That's how I learned about all this.
[00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:37.989]  When I was first getting on air in 1994-95, Fletcher came to town, came on my Access TV show, came on my local radio show, and he gave me huge binders that are somewhere, but I've got the documents now because the internet didn't have all these on it then.
[00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:39.789]  He got it from the U.S. archives.
[00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.690]  He spent a year in D.C. digging them all out.
[00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:45.869]  So we stand on his shoulders.
[00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.289]  I had Fletcher on a few years ago.
[00:34:47.309 --> 00:34:48.369]  I think he's still alive. I want to get him on.
[00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.769]  He actually worked for the CIA on record.
[00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:58.179]  So, let's continue here with what's happened before I had all these documents.
[00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:04.300]  Now some of this is overlapping because there's an hour-long interview with Ben Lemmings and the father of other weapons.
[00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:08.219]  And then I'm going to show him talk about this and I'm going to show you the documents.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:22.710]  But the Air Force and the Navy in consultation with Standard Research Institute certified all this in the mid-60s and then it got made secret and given to another division in 67 and 69.
[00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:26.170]  That they quote had full control of hurricanes.
[00:35:26.429 --> 00:35:29.369]  Could create them. Could steer them.
[00:35:29.489 --> 00:35:35.469]  Could kill them. And there is report to Congress need for a national weather modification research program.
[00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:38.030]  1974. Well they already had it.
[00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.170]  And there was a Nobel Prize won in 92 that Bill Gates has now picked up on.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:49.090]  He bought the company to, quote, spray the atmosphere to, quote, give the Earth sunscreen to stop global warming.
[00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:58.650]  They just add nuclei, barium salts, limited oxide, different forms of silver oxide into the fuel than the jet engines put out.
[00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:02.349]  The nuclei-causing particles.
[00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.289]  And they go, oh, that's just ice crystals.
[00:36:04.369 --> 00:36:09.969]  Well, I remember before the mid-'90s, a plane would fly by high, and you'd see the crystals form, then it would disappear in a minute.
[00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.150]  Remember? As a kid, you'd watch it disappear if you're old enough.
[00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:20.210]  And you'll see jets right by another jet that's chemtrailing, and its trails are staying, and a jet right by it's not leaving trails.
[00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.969]  So they talk to us like we're dumb.
[00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:26.949]  It's called geoengineering, high-altitude aerosol campaigns.
[00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.670]  There's congressional hearings.
[00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.909]  Go watch it. So let's go to SP1. Here's Livingston talking about some of the history.
[00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:40.110]  I'm interviewing him. And then we'll go to another clip where he talks about it being certified by the U.S. government.
[00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.429]  Here it is. Livingston.
[00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:47.969]  I'm the first person to ever see the cloud with the intention to cause it to do military damage.
[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.610]  I know I can say that.
[00:36:53.269 --> 00:36:54.690]  Tell me what these clouds are we're looking at.
[00:36:54.869 --> 00:37:05.030]  Well, these clouds were located up in the southern part of North Vietnam and we needed to make rain down on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Highway 1.
[00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.530]  But there weren't any real clouds around.
[00:37:09.289 --> 00:37:25.599]  There were a number, this was the end of the monsoon season, but there were a number of these small clouds that barely reached the freezing level and by putting a small amount of See,
[00:37:25.619 --> 00:37:31.079]  where I died in there, we got them to collect and start to build.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:41.340]  And as they built, we just worked on the largest tower in the group until, in a very short time, we had clouds that were...
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.059]  You told me this cloud got 14 inches of...
[00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:46.380]  Well, this cloud, of course, this is all the same cloud.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.440]  Most clear, top secret.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.760]  As high as you could get.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.440]  I got interested in weather modification when I was a farm boy.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.460]  I never could understand why the clouds weren't bigger, had a little more shade, and was chopping that cotton.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.619]  So I got in the Navy.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:10.519]  I managed to get into meteorology school, and I think that's really where I learned most of my physics.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:22.400]  I was assigned to the Typhoon Squadron in Guam, where I served for three years as a flight meteorologist and meteorological engineer.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.820]  From there, I came back to some additional school at Texas A&I University down in Kingsville.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:36.539]  And from Kingsville, they sent me to the Hurricane Hunter Squadron in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:38:37.489 --> 00:38:42.409]  That squadron, of course, had just become involved in Project Stormfury.
[00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:55.730]  So when I reported to that duty station as a meteorological engineer, I was immediately designated the military member of the Stormfury Advisory Board.
[00:38:56.579 --> 00:39:12.340]  We were doing quite a lot of testing work out over the test range at China Lake, California, where we dropped cloud seeding flares or silver iodide generators into clouds or just wherever we wanted to to see what the reaction was.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:22.300]  And it was there when I learned for sure that you could really change a cloud by the amount of silver iodide you put in it and where you put it.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:31.199]  This cloud here, from the time it started raining until it quit, it put out a little over 14 inches of precipitation.
[00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:33.039]  What did that do to the North Vietnamese?
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:42.340]  Well, it just washed all the roads out, and there was a bridge attached to a mountain that bombed and could not get rid of it.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.219]  This heavy rain washing down that river took that bridge out.
[00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:50.880]  So you guys finally got it done.
[00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:54.170]  This was on October 13th.
[00:39:56.349 --> 00:40:03.710]  These are cloud seating dispensing units on the side of C-130s.
[00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:11.610]  As you can see, these dispensers held 52 units.
[00:40:12.809 --> 00:40:18.449]  And under here, on this F-4, we had these camouflage, so they looked like they were...
[00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.849]  Did you fly those? Yes.
[00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.230]  You piloted the F-4?
[00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:26.849]  Yeah. So you're a jet pilot too, huh?
[00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:30.289]  Yeah, I did these for about seven years.
[00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:33.610]  You fly at all, huh? That's neat.
[00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:36.070]  And these were our own airplanes.
[00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.369]  The airplanes I had in my commercial cloud team business.
[00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:45.639]  Let's stop right there.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:51.260]  I'm gonna go to the next clip where he talks about certifying at U.S. government controlling hurricanes.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.480]  I'm gonna show you Congress, documents, U.N. treaties, all of it.
[00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:55.719]  And this just broke.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.260]  So I'm gonna move Pastor Brown back 15 minutes.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.760]  He'll understand. He's in Tampa.
[00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:08.789]  Congress is now confirming that Hurricane Helena did have U.S. government weather weapon planes in it.
[00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:09.909]  Now, we already have the tracks.
[00:41:09.969 --> 00:41:11.230]  We already have the tail numbers.
[00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.929]  They don't even have this crap.
[00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.409]  It just broke. It's on Infowars.com.
[00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:25.289]  Breaking. Lawmakers briefed on weather modification tech conclude Hurricane Helena was DOD-linked weather weapon deployed against American people.
[00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.309]  Bombshell. There's Dale Weddington, who we're getting on the show, I think, tomorrow.
[00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.530]  So there you go, a geoengineering watch with Colonel McGregor.
[00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.070]  That's kind of a big deal.
[00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:41.889]  Those clips are coming up. Okay, let's go to Lemmingson talking about after he...
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.199]  He's still in Vietnam, but coming back and then running projects and then totally controlling hurricanes.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:42:00.079]  Here it is. The results from the Hurricane Debbie experiment seemed so positive that many individuals believe the project should go operational, seeding major hurricanes that threaten land.
[00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:08.619]  A team of scientists at Stanford Research Institute at Stanford University did a decision analysis on all past seeding events.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.980]  Including the Astor, that's the 1961 and 1963 experiments.
[00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:26.460]  Dr. James Madison of that group, reflecting their views, stated, we claim they should consider seeding now if a big hurricane comes straight from Miami.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:42.760]  These scientists said the government may have to accept responsibility for not seeding and thereby exposing the public to higher probabilities of severe storm damage and possible higher A number of people,
[00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:54.079]  scientists if you will, who didn't necessarily endorse Applications engineering in these storms, they thought they needed more scientific data.
[00:42:54.599 --> 00:43:00.619]  They demanded that a third party investigate all of what StormFury had done.
[00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:08.880]  Stanford University was a party or the institution that did this study of the activity Project StormFury had done.
[00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:13.659]  In summary, the results of the Hurricane Deb experiments seemed so positive.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:21.380]  That many individuals believe the project should go operational, seeding major hurricanes that threatened any land mass.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:35.019]  And a team of scientists at Stanford Research Institute did a decision analysis on all past seeding events, including the ones in 1961-1963.
[00:43:35.539 --> 00:44:02.760]  And Dr. Matheson from Stanford University, the head of the Research Institute, reported that the government It's interesting that we were able to do that and have the results confirmed by Stanford University in 1969.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:15.599]  Since 1947, the government has used the logic or reasoning that liability It's a killer for weather modification.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:22.039]  But that's not why Project Storm Theory was killed, and that's not why they aren't doing it now.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:38.920]  In my opinion, the reason they're not doing it is well stated by a very senior official from the National Center of Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and he says, even if a well supported theory of hurricane modification existed,
[00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:46.889]  The potential legal aspects of weather modification on this scale argue strongly, in my opinion, against any such efforts.
[00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:55.869]  Just a few of the many possibilities include A. The storm is not modified at all, but some people perceive that it is.
[00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.309]  Get hurt and sue the modifiers.
[00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:13.829]  The storm is modified according to theory, but still does not significantly damage, does significant damage, and some people blame the modification on the damage, even though the modification actually reduced the overall damage and impact.
[00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:22.210]  And third, the modified storm produced winners and losers, and the perceived losers sued.
[00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:27.699]  For example, what if soon after the seeding, the hurricane abruptly changed course.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.719]  This happens all the time in nature.
[00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:38.199]  The people affected by the new course might well blame the modification effort and sue.
[00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:58.889]  If you study the situation, you may learn And very diabolically so, that you don't like to believe this, but there's a possibility, and the economics of it verifies the fact that there is so much damage done that the construction industry In general,
[00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.889]  all over the United States benefits because the cost of material goes up.
[00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:10.170]  So the insurance company may or may not gain from having these damage reductions take place.
[00:46:10.409 --> 00:46:19.170]  As far as the energy industry is concerned, we all know that they get their money back almost immediately by increasing their budget.
[00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:32.469]  All right, now you understand why you want to watch the full interview, which I will have reposted now, re-upload it to X. A secret history of weather weapons exposed by a Pentagon insider, something like that.
[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.750]  Now, it goes on, and he says they can control the hurricanes.
[00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:39.889]  I'm going to show you all the documents. But the point is this.
[00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:45.480]  They're blocking the aid.
[00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:49.119]  They're hiding the $9 billion or $7 billion, it turned out, they just had.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.539]  They gave a billion to the illegals.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.840]  The Democrats, like Axelrod, are bragging it's helping them keep the conservative areas from voting.
[00:46:55.019 --> 00:47:00.039]  They have the motive. They're attacking every form of our country, our energy, our dollar.
[00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:02.760]  They want to collapse us under Cloward and Piven to control us.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.840]  So they have the history, the motive, all of it.
[00:47:05.119 --> 00:47:10.760]  And the CIA director in a club I'm about to play said the same thing in 2008.
[00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:19.860]  15. On C-SPAN. He said, well, we can't really tell anybody about this because of the legal issues, but we're doing it.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.420]  So they just keep it secret.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:30.260]  Then we have the aircraft going in, and I have countless of these videos, by meteorologists, by scientists, and by lay folks who see the planes take off.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.099]  They go in and do the classic weather modification maneuvers.
[00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.280]  And the damn storms get stronger.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.019]  They could go in and knock the damn things down and dump it in the ocean.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.440]  But they don't. They use the excuse of liability.
[00:47:43.619 --> 00:47:46.980]  But they are controlling. And that's the whole history of this corrupt government.
[00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.280]  And other governments are doing it.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.199]  And there's a UN treaty, 77 and 78.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.199]  Two treaties against it. I'll show you those.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.960]  That CIA director talks about those treaties in a moment.
[00:47:57.219 --> 00:47:58.860]  But first, let's play one of the clips.
[00:47:59.019 --> 00:48:00.440]  And I looked this up myself. It's accurate.
[00:48:00.739 --> 00:48:02.980]  They're not even hiding these Department of Energy aircraft.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.139]  Working with the Pentagon, the Navy and the Air Force doing this.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:14.420]  Here's a clip. I'm not saying that the What I am saying is that the government has been manipulating the weather since 1947.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.840]  What first caught my attention with Helene was the shift in the storm's projected path.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.519]  One day, it looked like it would hit my town.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.559]  The next day, it had shifted east.
[00:48:25.019 --> 00:48:28.420]  I then noticed an odd flight path of NOAA 42.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.159]  The aircraft being flown?
[00:48:30.539 --> 00:48:43.550]  A Lockheed Martin Orion P3. This prompted me to look at previous uses for the P3, where I discovered that they were used in the 1960s to manipulate Hurricane Camille in a, quote, weather war on Cuba.
[00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:52.010]  Now, I know this sounds out there, but as we begin to see more and more the terrible things our government has done in the past, is it really so far-fetched?
[00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.630]  Here are the projections from the 23rd of September.
[00:48:56.289 --> 00:49:00.849]  A large spread traveling the Alabama-Georgia line and ending up in Illinois.
[00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:15.980]  Shifts slightly east, and the storm is projected On the morning of the 25th, the path shifts back west and shows to be finishing in western Kentucky.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.780]  That evening, a P-3 conducts a six-hour operation inside the developing storm.
[00:49:23.039 --> 00:49:31.380]  The next morning, on the 26th, the path shows to have shifted slightly east again, now finishing in northwestern Tennessee.
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:38.500]  The evening of the 26th, the same P-3 conducts operations throughout Hurricane Helene.
[00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:45.329]  As it makes landfall, and the storm's actual path shifts further east, finishing in northeastern Tennessee.
[00:49:46.389 --> 00:49:50.309]  What would the government's motivations possibly be to modify a storm?
[00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.889]  That I don't know.
[00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:57.190]  But I do believe that if we can maintain our republic long enough, time will eventually tell.
[00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.340]  The technocrats can control the weather.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.940]  The technocrats are cutting off the energy.
[00:50:09.019 --> 00:50:12.420]  The technocrats are brainwashing our children, tagging our families, but we're fighting back.
[00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:22.599]  Coming up next segment, I'll show you the CIA director in 2015 admitting they can control the weather, but they don't want the public to know about it.
[00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.099]  On TV, like you're an idiot.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:33.280]  Just like they go on C-SPAN with the scientists and Fauci, yeah, we created HIV, yeah, we're going to blow up the FDA system with the new virus soon out of China.
[00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:36.429]  We're just gonna, you know, approve all the mRNA shots.
[00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:37.489]  I've got those clips.
[00:50:40.949 --> 00:50:42.809]  They just tell you what they're gonna do.
[00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.230]  And we're only talking about cloud seeding so far.
[00:50:45.269 --> 00:50:57.269]  I haven't even gotten into all the clips I've got here about the Doppler radar or the lasers.
[00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:02.110]  And by the way, guys, I saw it in my stack, but I didn't see the laser clip from NBC News.
[00:51:03.239 --> 00:51:06.300]  Admitted they control the weather with lasers in my list, but I get it.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.400]  It's my fault, really.
[00:51:07.739 --> 00:51:11.079]  I hit the crew at like 50-something clubs, and I think like 47 of them are here.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.159]  Yeah, and there's a CBS clip, too.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.400]  Yeah, okay, that one's on there.
[00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:23.059]  Let's go ahead and just get the CBS in there, and we'll do the NBC later, and then I'll go over the documents here in a minute.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:34.550]  Let's go ahead and roll that. You know, they were talking about climate change yesterday, and now we're learning that scientists and researchers are looking at how to change the weather on purpose.
[00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:39.389]  That's right. Lasers now could one day manipulate rain and lightning.
[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:44.050]  CBS This Morning contributor Michio Kaku is a physics professor at City College of New York.
[00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.730]  Professor, nice to see you.
[00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:49.130]  Extraordinary seeing Al Gore and Bill Clinton there together with Charlie, wasn't it?
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.000]  That's right. Yeah. They did not get into this discussion, though.
[00:51:52.519 --> 00:51:53.599]  But it is fascinating.
[00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:55.760]  I mean, lasers? Really?
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.679]  To change the weather? That's right.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:03.619]  Well, as Mark Twain once famously said, everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.
[00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:15.309]  Well, instead of doing a rain dance, we physicists are firing trillion watt lasers into the sky to actually precipitate rain clouds and actually bring down lightning bolts.
[00:52:15.489 --> 00:52:17.590]  This is potentially a game changer.
[00:52:17.849 --> 00:52:19.650]  But this is experimental. It's experimental.
[00:52:19.909 --> 00:52:21.929]  However, in the laboratory so far it works.
[00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:28.630]  When you have water vapor and you have dust particles or ice crystals, you can precipitate rain.
[00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:30.409]  It condenses around the seeds.
[00:52:30.869 --> 00:52:33.469]  These seeds can also be created by laser beams.
[00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:43.670]  By firing trillion watt lasers, you rip apart the electrons, creating what are called ions, and these ions act like seeds, like dust particles, bringing down rain and even lightning.
[00:52:43.949 --> 00:52:54.800]  Go ahead. Well, this fascinates me in part because, too, I remember reading the stories that China had used this during the Olympics, that the USSR had used this after Chernobyl to create rain clouds.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.019]  Did those really work then?
[00:52:57.219 --> 00:52:58.900]  We have some of these capabilities now?
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:06.940]  Inconclusive. Even in the 60s, the CIA used this to bring down monsoons during the Vietnam War to wash out the Viet Cong.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.699]  Governments have been...
[00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:10.019]  Alleged to. Alleged to.
[00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:18.869]  Alleged too, right? Yeah. Now, we realize that for decades now, these governments have been alleged to have experimented with weather control, but nothing conclusive.
[00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:24.849]  Bullshit. This time we're bringing in the laws of physics rather than simply waving our hands and uttering mumbo jumbo.
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.469]  We're actually using trillion watt lasers now.
[00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.849]  And in the laboratory, sure enough, they precipitate rain out of water vapor.
[00:53:33.269 --> 00:53:36.550]  Sure enough, you can actually bring down electricity down the beam.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.320]  So what does it mean for drought areas that need to have rain for crops?
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.039]  And if they don't have them...
[00:53:42.039 --> 00:53:44.139]  That's what HAARP does....the consequences of famine.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.559]  Well, the bad news is, if it's a clear blue sky, it's not going to do anything at all.
[00:53:48.719 --> 00:53:53.460]  Because it only takes water vapor that's already in the air and condenses it.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:54:01.420]  However, for floods, for agriculture, farmers, for people planning waiting parties, football games...
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.539]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:08.030]  Alright, I'm moving as quickly as I can.
[00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:17.050]  We're getting an update from Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, good friend of mine, who has the biggest church in Tampa on what they're expecting, and then I'm going to continue with all the news here, because this has all got to get on record.
[00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:18.570]  I'm moving as quickly as I can.
[00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:20.630]  I'm about to get to all the documents and more.
[00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.889]  Just gave me the Father of Weather Weapons.
[00:54:23.389 --> 00:54:24.929]  I'm going to show you the Nobel Prizes.
[00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.849]  I'm going to show you the UN Weapon Treaties for Weather Control, the Department of Energy.
[00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.250]  I'm going to show it all to you, the CIA Director admitting it all.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:39.079]  But first, a great report out of Australia laying this out that I concur with that I want to get to.
[00:54:39.199 --> 00:54:40.599]  Then I want to play the CIA director. Here it is.
[00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:54.309]  We're actually using trillion watt lasers now.
[00:54:54.670 --> 00:55:02.789]  All of them could be subject to weather modification for floods, you name it, outdoor events and agriculture and even hurricanes.
[00:55:02.949 --> 00:55:43.139]  And even hurricanes? Again,
[00:55:43.179 --> 00:55:45.159]  this is mainly a visual video, but I wanted to get it on record.
[00:55:45.239 --> 00:55:54.199]  It's very powerful. The Democrats are all bragging that it's going to stop the voting of the conservatives and block mail-in ballots for conservatives and let them do a bunch of chicanery during the chaos.
[00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:59.500]  Now, here is the former head of the CIA at the time, the head of the CIA in 2015.
[00:56:00.539 --> 00:56:06.280]  This is Brennan talking about how they have the weather control, but they have all these treaties.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.739]  They don't want the public to know about it.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:19.239]  Here it is. Another example is the array of technologies that Often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[00:56:20.119 --> 00:56:33.619]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:45.309]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures, and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[00:56:45.909 --> 00:56:48.250]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[00:56:48.969 --> 00:56:55.530]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.
[00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:03.309]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community.
[00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:17.670]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[00:57:18.389 --> 00:57:31.130]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:37.590]  Others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions.
[00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:48.070]  And as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of SAI and other geoengineering initiatives.
[00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:56.590]  Now I could go on and on and on and on about the things that fascinate me, but rather than talk about them, I thought I'd stop here.
[00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.369]  And there it is. No longer a conspiracy.
[00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.090]  CIA admits plans for aerosol spraying for geoengineering.
[00:58:02.289 --> 00:58:03.789]  They're all doing it in secret.
[00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:09.110]  Much of it's declassified, but they act like it's not going on to the public.
[00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:14.929]  All right, so Hurricane Helene, now state legislature has seen the evidence.
[00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:18.909]  We have the evidence of the aircraft from the Department of Energy in there manipulating it.
[00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.170]  And remember, they can kill these hurricanes dead in the Gulf.
[00:58:22.449 --> 00:58:25.789]  That was certified by standards of research in the 60s with the Pentagon.
[00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:31.070]  The full interview lays it out with the documents with Ben Livingston that I did, I think, 2007.
[00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.889]  We're re-uploading that to Exit Real Alex Jones right now.
[00:58:36.019 --> 00:58:39.519]  I got Pastor Rodney Howard Brown popping in in a few minutes because he's in Tampa.
[00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:43.039]  He's the big mega church there. He's a great guy, a good friend of mine, my pastor basically.
[00:58:43.639 --> 00:58:46.579]  I want to get his take on all this and an update on what they're facing.
[00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:57.349]  And then I'm going to go over all the documents that I've been mentioning to actually show you the U.S. government documents, the U.N. documents, so you have it all here for yourself.
[00:58:57.809 --> 00:58:59.630]  So that'll be after Brown leaves us.
[00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:01.090]  It'll be almost about 20 minutes or so.
[00:59:01.429 --> 00:59:04.789]  And then we're going to take all this from the live feed, make a special report, and put it out.
[00:59:04.929 --> 00:59:08.590]  But I'm going to do a more detailed report as well in the next 48 hours.
[00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.329]  You can guarantee that. I'm just gathering more information.
[00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:47.000]  Almost all this I've already covered in pieces on the air over the years, but it's got to be put in one big massive Let's go ahead and air these two clips back to back.
[00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:55.030]  The question here is, how does this hurricane's path differ from others that we've seen?
[00:59:55.809 --> 01:00:06.570]  I've already had a lot of people call me from the Asheville area, talk specifically about the horrendous damage, and many of them pointed out that that is not Hurricane Alley, per se.
[01:00:06.889 --> 01:00:09.349]  It's not an area that normally attracts storms.
[01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.389]  Can you help us understand this?
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:18.539]  Well, the bottom line is it was directed there as the transmission recordings clearly show.
[01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:22.739]  They kept that moisture corralled there to deluge in the same location.
[01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:33.739]  So again, these are patented technologies and the fact that we have the entire so-called meteorological community denying that this is going on to protect their paychecks and pensions is absolutely criminal at this point.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:51.250]  We know we have private defense contractors that are neck deep in the patents that manipulate these storms, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, We know those two in particular do the weather modeling for the nation's weathermen, National Weather Service and NOAA. Again, both agencies have an illegal federal gag order on them.
[01:00:51.409 --> 01:00:54.309]  So at this point, this is an emperor has no clothes moment.
[01:00:54.829 --> 01:01:02.590]  That's the best description I can give for something that is so blatantly obvious and inarguable can only be considered weather warfare at this point.
[01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:07.210]  And the fact that, again, the so-called science community is denying this manipulation is criminal.
[01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:09.190]  It's absolutely criminal, Colonel Grego.
[01:01:10.869 --> 01:01:25.429]  If you can do so, could you tell us about some of your recent discussions, conversations, briefings that you've had with political leaders from the states in question that have asked you what you think?
[01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:33.340]  First of all, What did they specifically ask you, if you could tell us, and how did they respond to your answers?
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:48.940]  Yes, Colonel McGregor, I had an hour conference call yesterday with the representatives and senators from the Carolinas, and we presented the data to them to answer their questions about how this manipulation occurs.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.820]  They realized this was not a natural event.
[01:01:52.789 --> 01:02:03.590]  They're trying to digest the fact that their states were literally under assault from weather modification operations that are clearly connected with DOD operations.
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:10.449]  And we can speculate again on the agendas and objectives being carried out, but the fact that the storm was manipulated is absolutely inarguable.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:20.480]  We know that technology to stop these rotations from even occurring has existed for decades with the manipulation of atmospheric pressure zones.
[01:02:21.059 --> 01:02:23.800]  HARP in Alaska is one example many people are familiar with.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.099]  That's an ionosphere heater.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.780]  That's a weapon of mass destruction, period.
[01:02:28.199 --> 01:02:35.719]  It can cause an electrical chain reaction in the ionosphere, which heats it to extraordinarily high temperatures, which causes the atmosphere to bulge up and down.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:40.900]  The downward push creates a high-pressure Dome that can steer the jet stream.
[01:02:41.719 --> 01:02:44.420]  And the same type of manipulation can create low pressure zones.
[01:02:44.579 --> 01:02:50.260]  When they have this type of power over the climate system, they can make or break these storms anytime they want.
[01:02:50.659 --> 01:03:01.199]  And again, what we see now is storms kept weaker as they're over the ocean because they're harder to steer until they reach the land-based network of transmitters.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.119]  And then we have Colonel McGregor, rapid intensification.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.239]  You've heard that term probably a lot lately.
[01:03:06.969 --> 01:03:09.170]  Because that's how they manipulate these storms.
[01:03:09.329 --> 01:03:14.110]  And again, we have Acapulco last October being the extreme example.
[01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.289]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:18.110]  He's the head of the UN Engineering Watch, Dane Whittington.
[01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.710]  He's on tomorrow for a full hour.
[01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:21.610]  I've known him for 20 years.
[01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:23.949]  He's testified to Congress, legislatures, you name it.
[01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.710]  Let me explain something to you.
[01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.730]  He brings in the weather mod whistleblowers.
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.369]  It never makes the news.
[01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.630]  Okay, legislatures, federal, you name it.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.860]  You hear what he just said? Hurricanes always get weaker over land.
[01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:38.800]  Now they get stronger.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.199]  They are manipulating them.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.059]  We have the flight pass. Let's finish up and then go to Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:48.500]  Here it is. Because that's how they manipulate these storms.
[01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:54.980]  And again, we have Acapulco last October being the extreme example of rapid intensification.
[01:03:55.559 --> 01:04:04.639]  An insignificant low pressure system developed into the strongest Cat 5 hurricane to ever hit that part of the world in less than 24 hours, laid waste to Acapulco.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:14.239]  And by the way, Hurricane John, which just hit Acapulco again, As Hurricane Helene was wreaking havoc in the Carolinas, not many people know that.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.360]  So Acapulco just got dealt another blow.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:24.900]  So again, how many agendas and objectives are being carried out when we know they can manipulate these storms and we know they can make or break them anytime they want?
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:35.159]  And again, I bring up the oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico that seems to magically miss any sort of damaging storm again and again and again.
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:41.030]  While the storms wreak havoc inland and on shorelines, it's not a coincidence.
[01:04:41.389 --> 01:04:43.010]  They have that much sway over the storm.
[01:04:43.909 --> 01:04:48.309]  They can kill the hurricane, certified by the Pentagon and Stanford Research Institute in the late 1960s.
[01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:50.130]  Showed you the father of weather weapons earlier.
[01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:54.889]  I'm going to be shooting a detailed multi-hour report on this.
[01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:58.670]  But you just in the last hour plus saw all the analysis.
[01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:07.650]  After Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who has the biggest church in Tampa, a good friend of mine, gives us his take on this, I will then go over all the documents.
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:16.750]  Then in the third hour, I will hit all the other huge news and Elon Musk pledging to expose the pedophile rings and Bill Gates and their whole house of cards coming down, praise God.
[01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:25.789]  Now, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown joins us on the hurricane, also his view 27 days after the election, and where this world's going.
[01:05:26.449 --> 01:05:31.829]  He has Revival.com, Revival.com on X, R. Howard Brown.
[01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:33.949]  Pastor, God bless you.
[01:05:34.349 --> 01:05:35.550]  You're there in Tampa.
[01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:40.030]  They're calling this potentially the biggest storm ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:41.309]  What is your view, sir?
[01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:44.150]  Hey Alex, always good to see you.
[01:05:44.369 --> 01:05:51.409]  Yes, unfortunately, just like Helene was manufactured, this one's manufactured as you just played the clip.
[01:05:51.969 --> 01:06:02.809]  I mean, Operation Storm Fury was something the US government began to practice back from 1962 to 1983 to manipulate hurricanes and they can stop it and start it.
[01:06:02.909 --> 01:06:09.489]  So the bottom line is we get classified as a conspiracy theorist, but everything we're saying is true.
[01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:14.429]  This attack It's on the state of Florida for several reasons.
[01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:23.590]  Number one, to disrupt the Arc 4 corridor, to actually mess up the election, because if people are displaced, who's going to be voting when it comes to election?
[01:06:23.989 --> 01:06:28.369]  Number two, to destroy the city of Tampa so they can create 15-minute cities.
[01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:32.429]  It's all part of the UN Agenda 2030 of what they want to do.
[01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:35.409]  They would like to devastate the whole city of Tampa.
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:41.289]  This was portrayed In a video that you can see on YouTube called Hurricane Phoenix.
[01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:47.849]  Hurricane Phoenix, which gives us simulations 12 minutes long of what Tampa looks like after Cat 5 hits it.
[01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.530]  So this has been planned just like COVID-19 was.
[01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:54.469]  Now, people don't want to believe it, but we've been doing relief work up in the Carolinas.
[01:06:55.389 --> 01:07:00.730]  That whole region is sitting on the lithium deposits that now they've bought up all the land.
[01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.809]  People will not be allowed back on their land.
[01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:05.409]  Just like in Maui, Hawaii, it was a land grab.
[01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.530]  The same thing on the coast, all the coastal areas.
[01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:09.989]  You get rid of all the trailers.
[01:07:10.289 --> 01:07:11.869]  You get rid of all the mobile homes.
[01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:15.320]  So that they can do whatever they want to do, plus displaced people.
[01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:24.659]  FEMA went on this morning and made a mistake and said something about that they would exterminate 70 to 80,000 people.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.599]  I mean, extract 70 to 80,000 people.
[01:07:28.059 --> 01:07:30.059]  So this crazy stuff happened.
[01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:38.480]  Our governor just went live and he said that he would arrest any FEMA agent that tries to stop any rescue work being done.
[01:07:38.739 --> 01:07:43.519]  We have helicopters in the Carolinas that FEMA was stopping them.
[01:07:43.719 --> 01:07:45.960]  The bodies are by the thousands.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.659]  The stench of the human remains.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.519]  They will not let anybody pick it up.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.099]  Carolina, they're now burying the dead in their own backyard because the morgues are full.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.000]  So there's so much scam going on here.
[01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:00.619]  And Alex, you're right.
[01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:03.980]  Unfortunately, it's a war on the people.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.159]  But, you know, obviously we pray.
[01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:08.519]  We're praying that this thing weakens now.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.239]  They said it went to Cat 5, and now it's down to Cat 4.
[01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.010]  And they say it's weakening right now.
[01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:21.750]  So obviously because they can't steer it, the moment that they let it go down, it started moving south, which is against what they want.
[01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:25.229]  They wanted to hit Tampa and cut right across the I-4 corridor.
[01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:28.949]  I just saw that the city of St.
[01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.130]  Augustine has just issued a total evacuation.
[01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.449]  I mean, that's over south of Jacksonville.
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:38.109]  So you can see they're wanting this whole thing aimed at a certain path here.
[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:40.750]  To go and just create total devastation.
[01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:53.329]  Now something that's crazy, Alex, about several months ago I failed to set up a war game scenario in the event of an emergency, a contagion, a nuclear blast here at the river.
[01:08:53.609 --> 01:09:04.850]  Which is actually scheduled for Thursday night, all day Friday and Saturday, of how we would handle 5,000 people with a whole medical hospital, triage, everything, and food.
[01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:06.489]  I've set up a whole soup kitchen.
[01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:08.289]  This is all being planned already.
[01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:16.949]  So I told our church on Sunday, I said, I pray, what we're supposed to be doing is a mock exercise, and now it looks like I'm going to be using it for the real thing.
[01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:22.729]  I just felt in my heart, we were supposed to be away on our 43rd wedding anniversary.
[01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:24.210]  Everybody said, go to Hawaii.
[01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:25.369]  I said, I ain't leaving nothing.
[01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:26.829]  I'm not leaving anywhere.
[01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.409]  They said, you need to go.
[01:09:28.489 --> 01:09:31.569]  I said, no. I feel I have to be on the ground right now.
[01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:33.250]  So we've set up ham radios.
[01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.529]  We've got these walkie-talkies that are nationwide.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:47.579]  I've got pastors from as far south as the Everglades, Miami, all the way up through to Tallahassee, and from Jacksonville, all the way down to West Palm Beach.
[01:09:47.659 --> 01:09:49.960]  So we're in communication with them right now.
[01:09:50.539 --> 01:09:52.159]  I have a ham radio set up.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.079]  Obviously, we're doing everything we can to keep the congregation safe.
[01:09:55.319 --> 01:09:59.399]  Plus, we've told everybody, if you're in ABC areas, please evacuate.
[01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:03.949]  You cannot survive six to ten feet of water.
[01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:07.270]  It's impossible. So, obviously, we don't know what that's going to look like.
[01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:13.329]  The storm was first supposed to suddenly, when it was moving so fast, was coming in tonight, on Tuesday night.
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.449]  Then they delayed it. Now it's coming in on Wednesday night.
[01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.229]  Now they say it might be making a landfall on Thursday.
[01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:22.609]  So it's like they're trying to slow this thing down to get the maximum impact.
[01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:28.729]  And one of the unfortunate things is all the gas stations up to 75 have no gas.
[01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:36.689]  So suddenly you have hundreds of thousands of people trying to exit the state and they're being blocked from even leaving the state.
[01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:39.420]  I mean, the waterways are being blocked right now.
[01:10:39.579 --> 01:10:42.479]  Roads are being blocked so that people can't even get.
[01:10:42.579 --> 01:10:50.420]  So now you've got people in cars, women and children, husbands, and they're going to be stranded on highways trying to get out of the state of Florida.
[01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:58.920]  It took a family nine hours to get from Naples to my house.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:17.460]  We're good to go.
[01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:23.810]  For emergency response, I've got helicopters ready to go right after the storm.
[01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:25.930]  I've got truckloads of food coming in.
[01:11:26.409 --> 01:11:27.810]  We're doing everything we can.
[01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:29.750]  And of course, we were already ahead of the curve.
[01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:31.670]  I've now got people calling us.
[01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:38.750]  They want our manuals of what to do so we can show people how to light fires, how to purify water, how to get your car moving.
[01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:42.890]  But again, too, if roads are blocked, you're not going to be moving anywhere.
[01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:57.649]  So the big problem that you'll be dealing with It's all the debris that's scattered everywhere, which now Governor DeSantis had to do an executive order to tell them to move the debris from Helene, which was still blocking parts of Tampa.
[01:11:57.909 --> 01:12:03.489]  So if you've got all this debris floating around, people don't even know what to do with their cars, where they're going to park their cars.
[01:12:04.369 --> 01:12:05.550]  I know that St.
[01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:11.390]  Pete opened up a place for thousands of cars for people to put their cars there because they don't even know where to put the vehicles.
[01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:16.430]  So, you know, obviously, Floridians ride out hurricanes.
[01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:18.350]  A real Floridian knows what to do.
[01:12:18.789 --> 01:12:29.010]  But when you throw numbers like Cat 5 and then they were trying to make out a Cat 6, which as you know, there's no such thing as a Cat 6, but they were trying to say that this is the worst storm ever.
[01:12:29.369 --> 01:12:35.770]  It's a storm that's worse when you are heating up the ionosphere and you are creating the thing.
[01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:45.869]  If they have the ability to slow the thing down and disrupt the eye and to basically destroy this thing, Alex, then they're doing this on purpose.
[01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:48.449]  And this is a weapon against the American people.
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:52.010]  That's the bottom line. I don't care what anybody says.
[01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:53.750]  They can call me whatever they want to.
[01:12:53.989 --> 01:12:55.010]  I don't care.
[01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:56.810]  I'm going to stand up for what's true.
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:01.670]  The last three Sundays, my messages were preparation for the days ahead.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.539]  And I mean, we're talking right now about weather modification.
[01:13:04.699 --> 01:13:08.420]  We haven't even got into dark winter that's coming.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.420]  And all of the stuff that they've planned against America.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.500]  We are at war.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.579]  This is a war. You don't have to have a third world war.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.119]  We're in a war right now.
[01:13:18.439 --> 01:13:20.340]  And the American people are not ready.
[01:13:20.779 --> 01:13:23.439]  They're not ready for what's coming, Alex, unfortunately.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.659]  They don't know how to even change a tire.
[01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:27.500]  They can't make a fire.
[01:13:27.899 --> 01:13:30.430]  They just... They don't know what to do.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:31.850]  And I'm concerned for people.
[01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.609]  You know, I love people. And I'm concerned for people.
[01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:41.369]  And obviously, that's why we preach the gospel and tell people to give their heart to Jesus and get your life right with God.
[01:13:41.529 --> 01:13:43.229]  I mean, we are living in the final hours.
[01:13:43.689 --> 01:13:45.970]  And Jesus is coming very soon.
[01:13:46.069 --> 01:13:49.069]  We've got to get the gospel out, get people's lives turned around.
[01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:58.979]  And I just say this to anybody watching, if you're anywhere in the hurricane zones or whatever, If you pray right now and invite Jesus in your heart, just say, Lord, please help me.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.859]  God will help you through the storm.
[01:14:00.979 --> 01:14:04.819]  Whatever they're planning, because you're being subjected to war.
[01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:14.619]  This is war. And just like during any war that's taken place over the last couple of hundred years, people cried out and the Lord saved them and their family in the middle of a war.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.500]  This is not just weather.
[01:14:16.699 --> 01:14:19.380]  This is a war on America.
[01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:23.329]  And, I mean, I don't want to get into open borders.
[01:14:23.649 --> 01:14:24.770]  Millions of illegals here.
[01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:27.529]  Two million Chinese can put on military uniforms.
[01:14:27.789 --> 01:14:30.869]  And then the other military that's here...
[01:14:30.869 --> 01:14:33.689]  Yesterday was the seventh day.
[01:14:33.829 --> 01:14:35.550]  It was the anniversary of an attack.
[01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:39.949]  There were... Trying to say that right-wing people were going to launch a counter-attack.
[01:14:40.489 --> 01:14:44.289]  I mean everything set up so they can go to a civil war, do whatever.
[01:14:44.449 --> 01:14:47.390]  They're going to do whatever they can because they're frantic right now.
[01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:48.970]  Their whole world is falling apart.
[01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:50.630]  Everything's coming unglued.
[01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.449]  But I have a piece of my heart.
[01:14:53.529 --> 01:14:59.510]  I felt whatever they're doing is going to overplay their hand and everybody's going to see, even...
[01:15:00.039 --> 01:15:06.500]  On some of the mainstream media, I saw them questioning certain things, which mainstream media never questions anything, they just go along with it.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:14.220]  Even, to interrupt and stay with us, Pastor, but even 60 Minutes said you were appointed, you're basically a coup, to Kamala Harris.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:23.189]  What is that? Yeah, and basically today Biden threw Kamala under the bus because she has done nothing.
[01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:26.109]  Governor DeSantis said she wouldn't even talk to him or whatever.
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:31.470]  But apparently Biden has spoken to DeSantis and I pulled the clip up.
[01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:36.430]  Biden just said, Governor DeSantis has totally helped working together with us, helping everything.
[01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:37.930]  I told him you're doing a great job.
[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.470]  I gave him my personal number.
[01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:43.470]  So basically President Biden threw Kamala under the bus.
[01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:47.050]  I mean, if you see that 60-minute thing, she was like a blithering idiot.
[01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.970]  I mean, she had no earpiece.
[01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:50.170]  She didn't know what to say.
[01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:52.329]  Talked the biggest bunch of nonsense out.
[01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:53.609]  I can't imagine.
[01:15:53.909 --> 01:16:08.050]  But I see the tide turning, Alex, and I know you've been a voice for many, many years and Infowars, and even to see Elon Musk standing up like he is and beginning to realize there's a major problem going on here right now.
[01:16:08.329 --> 01:16:13.729]  So, I mean, I'm actually positive Even in the middle of all this storm and stuff like it.
[01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:21.869]  And what's so great coming out of the Carolinas, even though FEMA was blocking everything, the people were overriding everything FEMA was doing.
[01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:23.590]  Stay there. Stay there. We've got to go to break.
[01:16:23.949 --> 01:16:26.010]  I want to talk about Elon Musk. I want to talk about North Carolina.
[01:16:26.109 --> 01:16:27.729]  I want to talk about what you just said.
[01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:29.750]  Musk is saying we need God.
[01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:30.949]  We're fighting the devil.
[01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:34.189]  We're calling it a death cult, calling it a pedophile cult.
[01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:35.350]  The truth's all coming out.
[01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:36.909]  Praise Jesus. We'll be right back.
[01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:50.060]  Well, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown has one of the biggest churches in the country.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:56.680]  And I love going there because they've got these huge gardens and farms outside of the big gardens there at their church.
[01:16:57.319 --> 01:17:01.199]  And they teach the locals how to change a tire and how to grow food.
[01:17:01.579 --> 01:17:08.399]  And you heard him for months planning an emergency drill for the election starting this Thursday right after the hurricane hits.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.000]  That's how God works in mysterious ways.
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.420]  And I remember him, gosh, like...
[01:17:13.699 --> 01:17:19.300]  Three years ago when Musk first bought X, he goes, I believe, put it on air, Musk is going to bring you back.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:24.600]  And I believe Elon Musk is going to be even more hardcore because he's South African like me and I just, God told me so.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:36.890]  And it happened. And Then you got him talking about everybody turning on Kamala, 60 minutes, saying you were handed the nomination, no primary, no votes.
[01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.430]  That's not how our system was headed to work.
[01:17:38.609 --> 01:17:40.109]  Why are they turning against her?
[01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:46.689]  Trump's 14 points ahead in mainline polls that are skewed, so it's probably 20 points ahead or more in Pennsylvania.
[01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:49.470]  He's 5 to 10 points ahead now in battleground states.
[01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:53.250]  They are in panic mode. They already tried to kill him twice, but God's hand's been on him.
[01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:58.170]  And so I want Brown, because I totally agree with him, and so General Flynn says the same thing.
[01:17:58.710 --> 01:17:59.930]  Tucker says the same thing.
[01:18:00.789 --> 01:18:01.949]  Musk sees the same thing.
[01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:06.970]  Victory. And Musk said, yeah, they're going to put me in prison or kill me if Trump doesn't win, but I'm all in.
[01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:08.670]  And he's excited. He's joyful about it.
[01:18:08.729 --> 01:18:10.409]  He's talking about good versus evil.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.140]  Now, so Musk is really waking up when they took his son away from him.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:19.460]  He put him in a nice school, elite school, and they turned him in, you know, killed him in his own words.
[01:18:19.579 --> 01:18:21.659]  He turned him into a girl, which is no such thing.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.640]  And his brother almost died when he took the COVID shot.
[01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:26.039]  A bunch of his crew got sick from it.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.840]  And Elon really woke up.
[01:18:27.939 --> 01:18:29.180]  And I can tell you, listen to the show.
[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.079]  I'll leave it at that. He's right here in Austin, down the road.
[01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:33.899]  And there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.199]  And, you know, I've had everybody from Rogan to Tucker Carlson to...
[01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.029]  Everybody say that I was the main influence.
[01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:47.069]  Russell Brand, the list goes on and on, waking them up.
[01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:49.489]  And it's not about me. It's about God working through this broadcast.
[01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:57.329]  But the enemy has said, the New York Times, the Financial Times of London, and congressional hearings, they track this show back to the massive resistance we now see.
[01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:00.090]  That's God. And it isn't me.
[01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:04.289]  It's the show, the guests, the films, the crew, the reporters, the documentaries.
[01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:15.850]  But I said this 25 years ago, that I was sitting in a restaurant and After I'd done my local TV show, eating a chicken fried steak and drinking iced tea, and I got in there about nine.
[01:19:15.989 --> 01:19:17.489]  Nobody was in there. They were mopping the floor.
[01:19:18.029 --> 01:19:20.210]  And I didn't have a visual vision.
[01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:22.949]  I felt the presence of God, awesomeness.
[01:19:23.029 --> 01:19:24.710]  I wanted to get down on my knees.
[01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:25.829]  And I'm like, what's going on?
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.430]  Somebody slipped me drugs or something.
[01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:34.739]  And I was just like, it was literally the Holy Spirit said, okay, You know, you've been fighting some of the tyranny.
[01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:35.920]  Do you really want to fight it?
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.859]  And are you willing to go through what you got to go through?
[01:19:38.319 --> 01:19:39.439]  And I was just giving this download.
[01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:46.000]  I said, yes, yes, yes. And then I went on air right after and I said, I literally had like this experience where I was being told all these things.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.039]  It was awesome. You could feel the electricity in the air.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:56.880]  God said, well, you're going to do all this, and then it's going to cause a giant awakening.
[01:19:57.579 --> 01:19:59.880]  And I went on air and said, I had this experience.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.500]  Well, that was on AXS TV and a local radio station then, 26, 27 years ago now.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.800]  It happened. I've told that story a thousand plus times.
[01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:08.899]  I've told it for 25 plus years.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.399]  It happened. God's real, folks.
[01:20:11.779 --> 01:20:13.979]  And God touches people different ways.
[01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:17.810]  But... That is the reality of this.
[01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:31.189]  And it started with me when I was like 18, repenting of things I'd done that were wrong, God touching my heart, and then setting on that path, and then God saying, I want you to get on the air, I want you to oppose the globalists, I want you to oppose their agenda, I want you to research it.
[01:20:31.569 --> 01:20:36.829]  And I thought then, well, if I expose it, people later will see that it's true, and we can stop it.
[01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:41.239]  And now, 30 years later, And the mission just got stronger and stronger.
[01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:42.859]  I don't need to tell my own story, Pastor Brown.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.260]  I just want people to know how real God is.
[01:20:45.399 --> 01:20:51.880]  And people that haven't experienced God, I know if they just ask God in and ask God to show them how real God is, God will do it.
[01:20:52.039 --> 01:20:57.680]  So I want to talk about all the news with you, but it's important to really focus that God's not the most important thing.
[01:20:57.779 --> 01:21:02.720]  God is everything. From my own experience, how would you describe that biblically in today's context?
[01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:09.609]  Yeah, well, you know, everybody links God to some church or some denomination or some religion.
[01:21:09.789 --> 01:21:18.680]  But the fact that there is a God, I mean, we can take The last words on the deathbeds of many of the top atheists before they died.
[01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:22.760]  And they said they spent their whole life, but it's just been smoke.
[01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:25.520]  And they didn't believe in God, but there is a God.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.039]  And they said, I'm going to hell.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.680]  Many of them described, said, I feel the flames.
[01:21:29.899 --> 01:21:31.600]  So you can say what you want to.
[01:21:31.699 --> 01:21:32.800]  But the bottom line is this.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.619]  Let's leave the churches out of it.
[01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:44.189]  If you are watching right now and you don't know if there is a God, if you pray right now and say, God, if you're real, will you show yourself to me?
[01:21:44.489 --> 01:21:47.850]  God will come and show himself to you, and he'll become real to you.
[01:21:47.949 --> 01:21:51.149]  And I'm talking about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of the Bible.
[01:21:51.449 --> 01:22:00.470]  The God of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the book of Acts, the God who sent His Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for you, that you could be forgiven of your sin.
[01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:02.390]  So that's what I'm talking about.
[01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:05.989]  And the way to accept Him is just to say, Jesus, come into my heart.
[01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:07.250]  Forgive me of my sin.
[01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:09.449]  Thank you for dying for me on the cross.
[01:22:09.859 --> 01:22:10.960]  And I will serve you.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.800]  That's all. That's all you have to do.
[01:22:12.899 --> 01:22:15.439]  It's a total surrender of your life to Him.
[01:22:15.979 --> 01:22:28.689]  And so I want to just encourage anybody that's watching right now, if you have never Given your life to the Lord or you're not sure about anything, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see we at the closing of the ages.
[01:22:29.109 --> 01:22:31.710]  Everything is gone upside down.
[01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:34.829]  Whatever we thought was stable is unstable.
[01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:39.630]  I mean, it's like everything is shaking.
[01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:51.670]  The ground is shaking. Everything is shaking from the financial institutions, the weather, The money system, the governments of this world, everything's being turned upside down right now.
[01:22:51.869 --> 01:23:02.409]  The only thing that stands sure is eternity and God and surrendering your life to say, I'm going to serve you because we don't know how long our life will be.
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:07.329]  Your life is like a vapor that appears for a little time, the Bible says, and then vanishes away.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.659]  That's why we are to acknowledge God in our life where we say, I'll follow you and I'll serve you.
[01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:26.739]  And that's what Alex did that night in that restaurant where he was overwhelmed by God's presence and he didn't know the price that he would have to pay to just being the informer to leak out all this information.
[01:23:26.739 --> 01:23:28.199]  I'm so glad you did, Alex.
[01:23:28.819 --> 01:23:31.760]  And everything you say is true.
[01:23:32.159 --> 01:23:34.819]  I mean, that's what people can say what they're like.
[01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:38.189]  And you and I, we kind of get dramatic over it.
[01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:41.789]  I get dramatic over the whole thing so people think we're overdoing it.
[01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:45.569]  But you don't know how to emphasize it to get it across to people.
[01:23:45.710 --> 01:23:47.149]  I preach with a passion.
[01:23:47.409 --> 01:23:49.050]  I preach the gospel with a passion.
[01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:51.689]  And I get information to people with a passion.
[01:23:51.989 --> 01:23:53.350]  I mean, yeah, Noah...
[01:23:55.370 --> 01:24:09.869]  We're good to go.
[01:24:13.789 --> 01:24:20.609]  So I mean, if you went to NOAA right now, you couldn't find anything on this hurricane, the track, the path, or whatever.
[01:24:20.869 --> 01:24:22.789]  They've allowed outside companies to do that.
[01:24:22.989 --> 01:24:31.770]  And a lot of the stuff, they're generating AI to create the hype and the fear and whatever to get people reacting the way they are.
[01:24:31.909 --> 01:24:36.970]  So that basically they can bring order out of total chaos.
[01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:41.789]  That's what's happening. And that's why the gospel is the only thing that brings order.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:44.239]  Out of chaos. I'm in true order.
[01:24:44.439 --> 01:24:49.460]  It's when people come in line and give their life to Jesus and say, come into my heart, forgive me of my sin.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.539]  So I want to encourage you to do that today.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.619]  And then ask the Lord to fill you with His joy and His peace.
[01:24:54.939 --> 01:24:58.399]  Then you can have joy and peace in the middle of the worst storms of life.
[01:24:58.779 --> 01:25:04.600]  Alex, you know, my conference is coming up, not this Sunday, but the following Sunday, eight-day conference.
[01:25:04.819 --> 01:25:09.899]  And I called it, I called it, months ago, I called it Riders of the Storm.
[01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:16.399]  Can you believe that? The conference is called Riders of the Storm, and we're riding through a storm right now.
[01:25:16.819 --> 01:25:20.119]  And they're saying there's another big hurricane coming behind that.
[01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.220]  I mean, they said the thing's 10 days away.
[01:25:22.399 --> 01:25:24.819]  It's not even on the radar, but they said it's coming.
[01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:30.100]  I want to talk about Elon Musk, because you told me, you said, no, Elon will bring you back.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.920]  What do you think is happening with Elon Musk?
[01:25:31.979 --> 01:25:33.220]  Because you predicted he'd get hardcore.
[01:25:33.399 --> 01:25:36.720]  He is devastating the globalists even more than Trump right now.
[01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:38.869]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:25:38.989 --> 01:25:42.590]  I was watching him at Trump's rally, and he was so happy.
[01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.829]  He wore his hat, and I'm dark maga.
[01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:52.069]  Of course, a lot of people don't understand him, but he is questioning every single thing.
[01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:54.710]  And he's realizing, there's a lie upon lie.
[01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.130]  I've been watching all his exes.
[01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:59.409]  It used to be tweets, but exes.
[01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:03.069]  I've been watching what he's saying, and he's spilling the beans on everything.
[01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:04.930]  We really need to pray for his protection.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.000]  Like he said, if Kamala gets in, he said he's going to prison.
[01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:10.180]  But he is leaking everything out.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:18.579]  I mean, I told my wife, I said, when you've got the richest guy in the world leaking out all this stuff, then people got to realize something is up.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.380]  And I don't just believe it's Elon.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.800]  I believe there are many, many people, but they don't have a mouth...
[01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:30.850]  Or an amplification or they're a little afraid to come out and say things as they really are.
[01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:35.270]  People, we really got to pray that they have boldness and we got to pray for all these whistleblowers.
[01:26:35.489 --> 01:26:50.050]  Plus, the people inside the government that have taken the money from the system to basically destroy people's lives, maybe pray the conviction of God come upon their life where they just come out and say, I can't do this anymore.
[01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:51.989]  I have to spill the beans.
[01:26:52.170 --> 01:26:57.399]  So... That's what we're praying as a church, that God would disrupt them.
[01:26:57.739 --> 01:27:04.380]  And of course, we've been praying the last three days, four days since we knew the storm was coming, that God would disrupt this thing.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.500]  But there you have it.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.699]  Elon Musk isn't just building spaceships and electric cars.
[01:27:08.819 --> 01:27:12.260]  He's leading a charge into the new era, the dark MAGA era.
[01:27:14.299 --> 01:27:19.159]  Something that's very interesting, which I don't know if you saw it, Alex.
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:27.659]  It's basically, if you have a look, where he says we're going to Mars, apparently that's an acronym for something else, not going to Mars.
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:36.220]  And that his shirt was being displayed, people made a whole thing out of it, and they were saying, you know, this is what he's doing.
[01:27:36.399 --> 01:27:41.420]  I don't know what he's doing, but I do know I'm happy with what he's doing, and I'm glad he put you on.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:50.310]  And I think when the president went live, From the place where the former assassination attempt was, there were 10 million views immediately.
[01:27:50.989 --> 01:27:52.470]  So I don't know what the viewership is now.
[01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:53.710]  I haven't gone back to that point. Hundreds of millions.
[01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:55.130]  Let's expand on that.
[01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:56.949]  A billion views for the Trump interview.
[01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:07.329]  We need to do another one. So big picture, 27 days out from the election, Axelrod and other Democrats had met, mainly Republican areas in Florida and in Georgia and North Carolina.
[01:28:07.409 --> 01:28:09.670]  Others got hit. They're saying, this is good for us.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.300]  They tried to block the aid.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.680]  People just overrode them.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.020]  They are so desperate.
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:20.520]  Kamala's collapsing. What are you feeling in the spirit's gonna happen in the next 27 days, and what can we do to try to get Trump in?
[01:28:20.579 --> 01:28:23.840]  And we know then, after that, he's not being handed a bed of roses.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.500]  It's gonna be crazy once he's president-elect.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:36.319]  The Democrats have pledged, speaking of the devil, Axelrod and a bunch of congressmen have said that they're gonna have civil war conditions.
[01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:46.970]  Yeah, well obviously they're going to set up false flags, try to blame it on right-wing extremists who are unhappy with what's going on, which that's all bogus.
[01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:58.569]  I personally do not know, I'll say this on record, I told our church, I do not know of any person who is a conservative, right-wing as they say, who wants to kill anybody.
[01:28:59.050 --> 01:29:00.289]  Not one.
[01:29:00.949 --> 01:29:02.710]  I have no association with them.
[01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:04.369]  I've never met anybody.
[01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:13.630]  I know people that believe in the Second Amendment, that will defend their wife and their children, but I don't know anybody that's planning to overthrow a government using violent means.
[01:29:13.829 --> 01:29:16.770]  I don't know. They're not anywhere around me.
[01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:19.229]  They're not anywhere around our church or whatever.
[01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:30.270]  So, obviously, what they're trying to set up is a whole case for civil war here in America, which basically, if that happened, you wouldn't even know who you were fighting against, and you wouldn't even know why you were fighting.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.020]  Because it's just, that's the way they're doing.
[01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:35.359]  This is how they take down nations in the past.
[01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:40.560]  What we saw with Arab Spring taking place years ago is really what's happened right now.
[01:29:40.659 --> 01:29:46.039]  And the coup that's happened, which I think it's interesting that Uncle Joe...
[01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:48.189]  I called him Uncle Joe.
[01:29:48.329 --> 01:29:52.550]  Uncle Joe doesn't want to go because he's still flexing his muscles from beyond the scene.
[01:29:53.029 --> 01:29:58.130]  And Alex, you did it so well when you talked about the emergency that happened in Vegas and how they did the coup.
[01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:03.789]  Without him, the letter wasn't even his, and he wasn't even planning to resign or whatever.
[01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:06.470]  So they took over.
[01:30:06.829 --> 01:30:09.289]  Basically, they took over, replaced him with Kamala.
[01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:12.720]  And, of course, she's failed on every side.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:16.000]  But, again, I feel positive.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.880]  I think this thing is unraveling very fast.
[01:30:19.319 --> 01:30:24.000]  I think, obviously, I feel that people have seen through all the lies.
[01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:25.739]  I feel they're gonna...
[01:30:25.739 --> 01:30:27.380]  I think it's gonna go Trump's way.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.020]  But, obviously, you know what can be manipulated behind the scenes.
[01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:38.659]  And then, of course, what's taking place here in Florida, Georgia, Carolinas, and everything right now to disrupt everything.
[01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:42.810]  So there's a couple of cartoons and memes that I already tweeted this morning.
[01:30:43.350 --> 01:31:01.109]  I think this one, which I thought was funny, I was laughing at it, and it was a picture of Kamala in a helicopter, FEMA helicopter, and she's looking at some people on top of a roof house stop, and she says, how are you going to vote for Trump now?
[01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:02.510]  So there it is.
[01:31:03.130 --> 01:31:04.289]  You probably can't see it.
[01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:09.310]  We'll go to your ex and pull it up right now.
[01:31:09.449 --> 01:31:10.649]  We'll put your ex on screen.
[01:31:10.789 --> 01:31:13.989]  The crew can pull that up. So I thought that was funny.
[01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:15.510]  I just retweeted and went, hmm.
[01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:19.890]  So how are you going to vote for Trump now?
[01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:23.630]  Which is totally, it's actually a very clever move.
[01:31:23.789 --> 01:31:27.770]  If you displace all these people, how are they even going to get to the polls?
[01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:32.069]  Especially, let's say, the people that didn't have, yeah, there it is.
[01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:40.970]  Especially if people didn't have access to the ID books or whatever.
[01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:55.199]  Then, Sonny, they want to know you're going to have to show your ID. Illegals can vote without ID, but citizens, you're going to have to show your ID. Well, Pastor, in closing, I want you to recap, because I see it in the local news, but it's not getting national attention.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.819]  The gas is out on the key highways.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.600]  The people don't have anywhere to go.
[01:32:00.979 --> 01:32:10.220]  We better pray this hurricane, no matter what they're doing to it, slows down or goes somewhere else or dumps in the ocean, because you've lived there a long time.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.039]  You're a major community leader.
[01:32:12.739 --> 01:32:15.300]  Quantify exactly what you're saying and what you're predicting currently.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.899]  If it's as strong and does hit where they're saying, what's going to happen?
[01:32:18.779 --> 01:32:23.479]  Well, even six to eight feet storm surge is going to devastate major regions.
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.520]  I mean, we're just trying to recover.
[01:32:25.699 --> 01:32:28.760]  We've been helping families on the coast right now who lost everything.
[01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:31.020]  There's one guy worth over $200 million.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.199]  He's 73 years old.
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.859]  He owned all property in Bandera Beach.
[01:32:34.979 --> 01:32:37.180]  He had 35 cars and whatever.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.699]  I knew him. I met with the guy.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.359]  They found him homeless under bridge.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.880]  He didn't use a bank.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.199]  He doesn't have insurance.
[01:32:44.799 --> 01:32:46.859]  Everything's gone. Every single...
[01:32:46.859 --> 01:32:48.520]  They had to buy them a Chick-fil-A sandwich.
[01:32:48.739 --> 01:32:50.840]  I mean, so these people totally devastated.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:55.619]  We're trying to help them. Now they're getting another brunt because this thing's going to come back through.
[01:32:55.899 --> 01:32:59.399]  So basically, whatever was there is totally removed.
[01:32:59.619 --> 01:33:06.420]  If you have what they're saying, a Cat 4, Cat 5 come through, the devastation...
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:13.819]  I really want to encourage people to go watch Hurricane Phoenix and see what they simulated to show what's going to take place.
[01:33:14.529 --> 01:33:24.369]  I mean, Tampa General, in this last storm that came by, fortunately, they got these big flood storm things that they built and they went up.
[01:33:24.569 --> 01:33:28.350]  Otherwise, the whole first floor of Tampa General Hospital would be closed.
[01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:31.590]  I mean, already getting reports of hospitals already that are closed.
[01:33:31.859 --> 01:33:34.239]  That they're not able to handle anybody coming.
[01:33:34.439 --> 01:33:37.359]  So in the event of emergency, where are you going to go?
[01:33:37.579 --> 01:33:40.359]  Now, one of our pastors stopped by a gas station.
[01:33:40.439 --> 01:33:42.460]  There was nobody there. And it said out of fuel.
[01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:43.939]  He just pulled his car up.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.760]  He grabbed the pump, put his credit card in, and it worked.
[01:33:46.899 --> 01:33:56.720]  And he pumped fuel. So I don't know if the gas stations on certain brands have been told, just pretend that your gas station's out of fuel.
[01:33:57.619 --> 01:33:58.659]  What's this crazy stuff?
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.819]  How did he get that?
[01:33:59.819 --> 01:34:00.859]  Well, again, that's technocracy.
[01:34:01.039 --> 01:34:11.380]  That's how they attack us. Since you mentioned, I want to play this clip before you leave us, of all the crazy stuff on 60 Minutes, here they are throwing it in her face that she's been selected, not elected.
[01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:21.460]  Here it is. Democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination.
[01:34:21.779 --> 01:34:23.739]  You didn't have to go through a primary process.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.380]  You didn't have to fight off other contenders.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.119]  That's not really the way our system was intended to work.
[01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:40.399]  President Biden made a decision that I think history is gonna show is rare among leaders.
[01:34:41.489 --> 01:34:45.390]  Which was to put country before self.
[01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:55.970]  And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee.
[01:34:56.949 --> 01:35:12.180]  I am proud to have received the endorsement of leaders around this country from every background and walk of life to fight in this election over the next month For our democracy.
[01:35:12.979 --> 01:35:20.479]  But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.840]  Look, I've been in this race for 70 days.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.880]  Oh, wow. Wow.
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.340]  I mean, you talk about upside-down world, Pastor.
[01:35:28.819 --> 01:35:31.079]  She's appointed and she calls that democracy.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.659]  I mean, that's wild, Pastor.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.920]  Doesn't it make sense?
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.680]  Well, basically, if you watch the whole thing, all you see is rambling after rambling.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:48.100]  I mean, she goes on and you can see she doesn't do well without some kind of hearing device in the ear where she can hear what they wanted to say.
[01:35:48.739 --> 01:35:56.159]  Just her unscripted is just a bunch of Blah, blah.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:57.920]  I mean, it's nothing. Horseman error.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.079]  Pastor, I love you. We're praying for everybody in Florida and all over the South.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.460]  And obviously, as long as your power stays on, I want to get updates from you in the next few days.
[01:36:07.619 --> 01:36:08.779]  Revival.com.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.739]  You can also find Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on X. Tell your lovely wife that we really appreciate her as well.
[01:36:14.819 --> 01:36:17.279]  God bless you. Yes, I'm yours, Alex.
[01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:18.619]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:36:18.819 --> 01:36:28.270]  Thank you, sir. Alright, I did the first hour plus on the history of weather weapons and documents and clips and admissions.
[01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:33.689]  I didn't get into the lasers yet or how they use the radar control systems and their own patents to do it.
[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:35.250]  And I remember...
[01:36:36.439 --> 01:36:49.600]  In like 1997, an engineer that was putting in the Doppler systems that the government paid for, it's not just so you can see the weather, saying they're putting in power 10 times what they need, and he was told it's for weather control to ionize the atmosphere.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.880]  So when we come back next hour, I'm going to go through all these documents and UN treaties and more clips and everything.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:00.500]  And Bill Gates saying he controls the weather and runs the Department of Energy program.
[01:37:00.539 --> 01:37:03.100]  He doesn't just run the vaccine response and all this.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.449]  I mean, this is crazy. And it's all coming up.
[01:37:07.289 --> 01:37:11.529]  Now, before we go to break, I'm just going to say this again.
[01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:15.050]  The enemy has tracked InfoWars and what we've done together.
[01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:18.710]  The crew, the listeners, the guests, the documentaries, the special reports.
[01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:24.989]  The vast majority of the enemy's problems, they track back to this show.
[01:37:25.789 --> 01:37:28.569]  Now, we're getting where we got Elon Musk and everybody else awake.
[01:37:29.619 --> 01:37:31.020]  And so, thank God.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:37.000]  And I said that. The point we'd get to in my mission was where everybody else would wake up and I wouldn't be as important as I was.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.420]  I think I'm still important.
[01:37:39.619 --> 01:37:40.859]  I think this show is still important.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.960]  I think the crew is still important. And we have a lot of work to do.
[01:37:43.039 --> 01:37:44.380]  We're reaching tens of millions a day.
[01:37:44.979 --> 01:37:46.279]  And we're almost there.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:51.180]  And when the time comes, when we're turning the tide or whatever happens, then I'm happy to not be here seven days a week.
[01:37:52.039 --> 01:37:54.659]  35 days left until they try to shut down Infowars.
[01:37:54.779 --> 01:37:57.899]  They're even trying in a hearing in a week in Austin.
[01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:01.800]  I need your support right now to continue to fight.
[01:38:02.199 --> 01:38:13.840]  When you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, getting t-shirts and ball caps and hoodies that are the highest quality designs made right here in America, in Arkansas, printed right in Arkansas, you support us.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:17.680]  But now, we could have had this a long time ago, but they waited to get the very best.
[01:38:18.329 --> 01:38:30.750]  It's the hottest thing for the last few years, CMOS, a particular type that is full of the very best iodine that goes right into your bloodstream, right into your cells and all these other elements and trace elements that are in this particular type of CMOS that's coveted.
[01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:34.250]  This is from the top manufacturer, the top rate in the country.
[01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:38.630]  They're letting our sponsor private label it.
[01:38:38.909 --> 01:38:40.729]  That's the whole fight club element of this.
[01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:43.229]  For all the attacks, there's all this other great stuff that happens.
[01:38:44.439 --> 01:38:48.899]  This is amazing for your brain, for your body, for your stamina, for your libido.
[01:38:49.039 --> 01:39:05.079]  If you love X2 and X3, I'm not going to say this is better, but quite frankly, it's next level because it has all the other stuff in it as well that's in the CMOS. It is full of just super concentrated vitamins and minerals and trace elements, and it's been concentrated into these delicious tasting gummies.
[01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:08.460]  You want to take one of these every day.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.020]  Your children want it. Everybody needs it.
[01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:13.779]  Old folks particularly, but down to three-year-olds.
[01:39:14.079 --> 01:39:18.779]  This is incredible, and it funds the operation, which is a 360 total win for everybody.
[01:39:19.239 --> 01:39:23.739]  So get Ultimate CMOS from our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:39:24.579 --> 01:39:25.979]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:27.600]  And while you're there...
[01:39:28.079 --> 01:39:30.560]  You can get all these great hoodies and ball caps and t-shirts.
[01:39:30.739 --> 01:39:46.439]  You'll see two t-shirts, the Alex Jones Show and the classic InfoWars shirt, red on navy blue, that are $50, not $25 or $30, because the shirts cost like $15 and they're such high quality, so that we get even more money if you want to spend extra to have these limited edition shirts.
[01:39:47.579 --> 01:39:52.119]  They are exclusively available and those are the ones to get if you really want to support us at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.279]  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your support.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.619]  Also, I just finished up my personal bankruptcy, had no money.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.420]  I already had legal bills I had to pay.
[01:40:01.779 --> 01:40:07.920]  The legal defense money that just came in to fight the Democrat Party law firms Just paid the previous bills.
[01:40:08.079 --> 01:40:09.199]  We need more money now.
[01:40:09.239 --> 01:40:13.039]  I want to thank folks. We're at $200,000 at realalexjones.com.
[01:40:13.199 --> 01:40:14.300]  That takes you to give, send, go.
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.560]  That's great. But I need more funds.
[01:40:16.899 --> 01:40:19.960]  They've spent over $70 million the last six-plus years.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.060]  It's in the news. Look it up.
[01:40:21.319 --> 01:40:27.199]  Trying to shut me down. So for a very small percentage compared to them...
[01:40:28.079 --> 01:40:29.720]  We're able to hold them off.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:38.859]  So I want to thank everybody that's donated and encourage those that haven't, who really want to support, whether it's $1 or $1,000, whether it's $10 or $20, go to realalexjones.com.
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:41.960]  And behind the scenes, we're doing a lot of work.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:45.000]  They shut down Infowars on the 13th to keep fighting.
[01:40:45.159 --> 01:40:47.000]  But we've not reached our goals yet.
[01:40:47.079 --> 01:40:49.039]  So it's up to you. It's your decision to keep us on air.
[01:40:49.279 --> 01:40:50.300]  I want to thank you all.
[01:40:50.539 --> 01:40:51.920]  Those of you on the fence, what are you doing?
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.020]  History's happening now. This is how you fight.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.039]  RealAlexJones.com to donate.
[01:40:56.279 --> 01:41:01.680]  And TheAlexJonesStore.com to get the t-shirts, the Ultimate CMOS, and more.
[01:41:01.939 --> 01:41:09.020]  You want Next Level? You want the Ultimate CMOS. By the way, it's 40% off, limited supply, and you get even more when you get three packs or two packs.
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:14.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.079]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show live, broadcasting from Central Texas worldwide.
[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:23.710]  All right. Some stations don't carry this first five.
[01:41:23.789 --> 01:41:25.569]  I just want to play a key Elon Musk clip here.
[01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:36.590]  Join the stations at six after and go over all the history of weather weapons and the big enchilada that they could bare minimum kill this, certified, confirmed, declassified, and they're not.
[01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:40.609]  And then the evidence is they're in there manipulating these storms big time.
[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:42.149]  We've got to get this out.
[01:41:42.289 --> 01:41:44.029]  So share the live feeds at RealAlexJones.
[01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:46.750]  Share the feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:49.409]  It is so critical and man.video.
[01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:51.550]  You're the ambassadors of truth.
[01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:53.430]  When you take action, nothing can stop you.
[01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:54.909]  God is working through you.
[01:41:55.270 --> 01:42:05.050]  And when I archive the clips from the first hour, the first part of the second hour, and now what I'm about to do, into one piece, that'll be a critical report if people want to understand what's really happening.
[01:42:05.989 --> 01:42:10.170]  Here is Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen, talking about what we're facing.
[01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:13.010]  Part of it, I suppose, is...
[01:42:14.829 --> 01:42:16.449]  It's sort of the decline of religion.
[01:42:17.829 --> 01:42:21.210]  So, you know, as the saying goes, nature abhors a vacuum.
[01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:34.409]  So when you have essentially a decline in religion, an increase in the secular nature of society, for most people they need something to fill that void.
[01:42:35.319 --> 01:42:42.220]  And so they adopt a religion, it's not called a religion, but effectively like woke, the woke mind virus, it takes the place of religion.
[01:42:42.399 --> 01:42:48.300]  Yes. And they internalize it and they feel it with religious fervor.
[01:42:48.539 --> 01:42:50.880]  Yes. And rigidity.
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:52.880]  Yes. Yes.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:58.420]  And they essentially conduct like a holy war, effectively.
[01:42:59.479 --> 01:43:03.140]  It's just not called a religion, but it is a religion, sort of a work holy war.
[01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:12.409]  And they're highly resistant to change as is normal for religions.
[01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:21.710]  So, now for myself, I sort of see myself as a sort of engineer, physicist.
[01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:25.989]  For me, I'm culturally Christian.
[01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:28.609]  I grew up Christian. I mean, I was Anglican.
[01:43:28.909 --> 01:43:30.270]  I was baptized, you know.
[01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:33.229]  I went to Sunday school.
[01:43:34.409 --> 01:43:40.090]  Yeah. Actually, oddly enough, I was sent to Hebrew preschool and Anglican Sunday school at the same time.
[01:43:40.210 --> 01:43:45.729]  So it was Habana Gila one day, Jesus outlawed the next, which is, you know, if you're five years old, it's fine.
[01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:48.909]  There's no, you know.
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:44:02.199]  I'm not Jewish, it's just that my father's two partners in his engineering firm went to the same Hebrew preschool and it was near our house so I just got sent there.
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.380]  Maybe this will make me even more amused.
[01:44:20.319 --> 01:44:25.180]  I have trouble believing all these stories, these religious stories, but a lot of people do.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.880]  And I respect people who want to have religious views.
[01:44:30.039 --> 01:44:32.420]  I'm not trying to dissuade them from their religious views.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:45.779]  I guess the operating system I have is sort of a physics engineering operating system where I try to understand as much as possible about reality.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.460]  In physics, you're not supposed to believe anything absolutely.
[01:44:51.779 --> 01:44:53.039]  You're supposed to question things.
[01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:54.380]  That's how you discover new physics.
[01:44:56.289 --> 01:45:00.510]  In engineering, that's how you discover if your machine will work or not work.
[01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:13.729]  Will the rocket get to orbit? If your rocket is designed with physics in mind correctly, it will get to orbit.
[01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:18.189]  And if it is not, it will not get to orbit, no matter what your belief system is.
[01:45:18.529 --> 01:45:32.899]  You can believe. I meet a lot of people, speaking of L.A., I meet a lot of people in L.A. who believe witchcraft is real and that you can do spells.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.039]  And that spells and witchcraft, magic is real.
[01:45:36.319 --> 01:45:38.800]  I'm like, can you magic us to the moon?
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.640]  And no one has yet been able to magic us to the moon.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.300]  Spells can't be that good, okay?
[01:45:46.539 --> 01:45:48.380]  If you can't... I want to go to the moon.
[01:45:48.479 --> 01:45:49.640]  Let's go. How about Mars?
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.939]  Dude, we got to the moon the first time.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.000]  We definitely went to the moon, I swear.
[01:45:55.579 --> 01:45:58.199]  Yes, we went to the moon. We went to the moon several times.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.039]  Right, yeah. I just want to check your view on that.
[01:46:01.859 --> 01:46:30.739]  100% went to the moon. I'm sitting here in the Infowars studios in central Texas And I'm trying to think of words that ascribe to the wonderful audience of people just how historic and urgent and existential the situation is we're all in.
[01:46:30.779 --> 01:46:32.420]  And I don't think you need me to tell you that.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:37.180]  You see it, you feel it, you know it, your guts, you intellectually understand it.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.819]  And the enemies of freedom want to play God.
[01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:46.680]  They've got all these advanced technologies that we developed through God's influence.
[01:46:48.449 --> 01:46:50.170]  And they want to get rid of us.
[01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:54.050]  They want to demolish us like a building that's in the way of their highway.
[01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.170]  And they're totally selfish.
[01:46:57.069 --> 01:46:59.350]  And we have to admit evil exists.
[01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:03.729]  And we have to oppose it, but we also need to know that good exists.
[01:47:04.569 --> 01:47:08.770]  And I understand why the public hears the stuff we talk about, and it's challenging.
[01:47:09.369 --> 01:47:22.170]  And for people that are in a trance state, In a very close to dream state, like scientific studies show since the advent of television or the destructive nature of it, people have gotten closer and closer into an unconscious state.
[01:47:22.409 --> 01:47:23.710]  Many of them are in an unconscious state.
[01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:32.310]  They're NPCs. And they hear about the world government, the new world order, and the open borders, and the homelessness, and they just want to give up.
[01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:34.789]  Or they Stockholm Syndrome and they join the evil.
[01:47:35.569 --> 01:47:36.909]  They join with Saron.
[01:47:40.789 --> 01:47:55.500]  So... They need to understand that when you oppose corruption, and when you open your soul up to God and the infinite, all of that evil will no longer have any power, and it's a joke.
[01:47:56.359 --> 01:48:03.000]  In fact, you can't even believe people serve it just so they're world leaders or powerful.
[01:48:03.659 --> 01:48:10.699]  Because the real power is getting into God, jumping into that river that takes you where you're supposed to go.
[01:48:11.739 --> 01:48:16.180]  And you don't give up anything when you surrender to God that matters.
[01:48:16.439 --> 01:48:20.279]  You expand your consciousness, your awareness, your power.
[01:48:20.539 --> 01:48:26.739]  But then in the presence of God, all the power that God's reflecting onto you means nothing because it all comes from God.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.760]  Like life on earth comes from the sun, but beyond that to the infinite.
[01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:35.079]  And so it doesn't matter if the world demonizes you.
[01:48:35.079 --> 01:48:36.659]  It doesn't matter if Satan comes after you.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:43.520]  It doesn't matter if people make fun of you in the system because that's what you expect to happen when you're doing your job.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:50.520]  And the more I get persecuted and the more I go through attacks, the stronger I get.
[01:48:51.359 --> 01:48:54.279]  As Nietzsche said, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:15.819]  Now, If somebody was teleported from 150 years ago to today, from 1830, and they saw all of this,
[01:49:15.819 --> 01:49:17.039]  it would just not even be real.
[01:49:17.039 --> 01:49:30.180]  They think it was magic. And when I talk about a breakaway civilization, it'd be like if you went to the South Pacific to some island with headhunters on it, and they still have those, but they'll eat you if you go there.
[01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:45.789]  They'll kill you. And you got one of those folks to get on a boat and go to an island that had an airport and fly them to, say, Tokyo, they would think they were on another planet.
[01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:54.909]  And it's the same thing with a breakaway civilization.
[01:49:54.909 --> 01:49:58.010]  That's what it is. We think we're in the year 2024.
[01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:03.750]  And technology is in the year 2050.
[01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:05.329]  It's just not fully deployed.
[01:50:05.729 --> 01:50:16.270]  It's been said by so many, no one knows who first said it, because every time I try to find the original quote, I find, you know, 50-, 40-year-old quotes, and it's been said by a lot of people.
[01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:19.270]  In fact, look up who said to the crew.
[01:50:20.289 --> 01:50:24.909]  The future is here, it's just not equally distributed.
[01:50:25.989 --> 01:50:28.789]  And the best analogy, because it's art imitating life...
[01:50:32.890 --> 01:50:46.289]  Fifty years ago, cargo cults of Melanesia, I don't know who said that, throughout Melanesia, primitive men await a black messiah who will bring them large cargo, European goods.
[01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:51.850]  These cults typify the, I don't know why they pulled that up, I don't know what it's about, but go ahead and take it down, thank you.
[01:50:52.689 --> 01:50:56.310]  Anyways, the crew just searches things I say and sometimes comes to things I don't understand, but that's fine.
[01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:57.470]  People can look it up and find what that means.
[01:50:57.729 --> 01:51:13.630]  Let me go back to where I was. So,
[01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:29.710]  if an aboriginal headhunter was put on a boat, taken to an island, got on a jumbo jet, flew to Tokyo or Beijing or New York City or Stuttgart, Germany or London,
[01:51:29.829 --> 01:51:36.149]  England or Mexico City, they would think they were on another planet.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:44.479]  Now, that's what a breakaway civilization is like in the larger Maine.
[01:51:44.859 --> 01:51:53.960]  And you use the analogy of the Hunger Games, which is art imitating life, which is what the UN in the 60s, and I've covered this with expert guests on here, we should revisit it.
[01:51:54.859 --> 01:51:59.939]  They describe the future like they said, we will have high-tech city-states per region.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.420]  There'll be 10 regions. There'll be three mega-regions.
[01:52:02.739 --> 01:52:04.319]  Funny, Revelation says that too.
[01:52:04.619 --> 01:52:22.319]  Funny. And in these high-tech reservations, there'll be incredible technology and life extension, but in all the other areas, it'll be mainly depopulated, but it'll be kept very rural, and people won't even have electricity, and we will reintroduce primitive superstition,
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.619]  and we will bring back even human sacrifice.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:31.899]  That's in a UN battle plans that I covered, that he got the documents from major universities, Dr.
[01:52:32.079 --> 01:52:35.199]  Michael Kaufman, who's an endgame, but we did an expanded endgame.
[01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:38.409]  And I've got to find the interview and narrative.
[01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:39.590]  It shows all the documents. It's amazing.
[01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:42.989]  It's like Endgame 1.2 or something.
[01:52:43.029 --> 01:52:44.250]  So I did a bunch of Endgames and I didn't.
[01:52:45.829 --> 01:52:52.670]  And they describe a Hunger Game type system with these districts.
[01:52:54.529 --> 01:52:57.909]  So when we talk about breakaway civilization, they've got cancer cures.
[01:52:58.109 --> 01:53:00.449]  They've got human-animal clones, human clones.
[01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:02.590]  That stuff's 40, 50 years old.
[01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:04.329]  That's all admitted, but they don't show it to you.
[01:53:05.279 --> 01:53:10.039]  They just admit it's going on in MIT Quarterly and Defense Department reports that we've shown you on air.
[01:53:11.819 --> 01:53:13.760]  And there's so much other stuff going on.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:22.039]  So before I hit all the weather weapon stuff and finish up with that, I just want people to really understand that they don't want you to have the live essence of technology.
[01:53:22.039 --> 01:53:23.960]  They don't want you to have the free energy.
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:40.470]  They don't want all this because then that frees the general public to not be waiting in red tape and drowning in debt where you're so busy At work 12 hours a day, you just come home, throw in GMO TV dinners lined with plastic that sterilizes you and your kids,
[01:53:41.489 --> 01:53:46.750]  gives you cancer, watch four hours of television, play some video games, do it all over again.
[01:53:47.170 --> 01:53:56.729]  They don't want you, listen to me, in the way of their future, in the way of their selfishness, in the way of their plan for the future.
[01:53:57.979 --> 01:53:59.460]  And I'm hitting the heart of the whole matter here.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:16.399]  So if you don't address the anti-human death cult and why they want that, and why they're trying to destroy our civilization on its ashes, build their technocracy, if you don't know what a technocracy is in the modern parlance, if you don't read what the Club of Rome is saying and what the UN is saying,
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:23.260]  what the WF is saying, what Bill Gates is saying, if you don't read what they're setting up, Then you have no future.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:26.279]  They know you're watching zombie movies.
[01:54:26.399 --> 01:54:32.140]  They know you're watching the NFL. And so they get up at their conferences, Bill and Melinda Gates conferences.
[01:54:32.159 --> 01:54:33.479]  I've played this probably a hundred times.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:37.560]  And they give him awards for depopulation at his own awards ceremony.
[01:54:37.939 --> 01:54:44.739]  He gives himself awards for his Global Human Population Control Foundation.
[01:54:44.739 --> 01:54:46.180]  That's the real name of it.
[01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:48.390]  Not Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:54:48.829 --> 01:54:55.170]  And again, they sit there and release this stuff, admitting world government, depopulation, all this horrible stuff.
[01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:57.609]  You'll own nothing. You'll be happy.
[01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:59.470]  You'll eat the bugs. They'll ban eating meat.
[01:55:00.170 --> 01:55:01.829]  You won't own a car. You won't own a house.
[01:55:01.949 --> 01:55:04.029]  You won't own your own furniture. It's all been announced.
[01:55:04.210 --> 01:55:07.489]  They're rolling it out. They're sabotaging the old economy to build a hellish one.
[01:55:09.399 --> 01:55:14.560]  And if you can't read what they're saying and doing and then oppose it, they have no respect for you.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.020]  But I don't care if they respect me or not, which they do.
[01:55:17.239 --> 01:55:25.539]  They fear me. Because I refuse to be their slave and I refuse to go along with this anti-human death cult project.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:30.779]  And my frustration is this should be so simple to understand.
[01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:43.970]  Because just like all the weather weapons are here, and the admissions they're using them, and the admissions they're doing it, and I'm about to go over the documents.
[01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:53.750]  Then when we address it and cover it, they'll have headlines everywhere by tomorrow, guaranteed they already do, attacking me, just the last two days.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:59.899]  We're pointing out, this is obviously weather weapons, and bare minimum they stood down and didn't stop these hurricanes.
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:11.619]  And they have the evidence of the government aircraft in there doing exactly the maneuvers they would do with the aerosols they release of silver iodide and the rest of it to do it.
[01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:18.149]  And then when we address it, they'll just say, oh, they're crazy.
[01:56:18.569 --> 01:56:22.970]  The same guy that says, you know, frogs are gay and Sandy Hook, blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:26.329]  Just hoping people don't even look at that information.
[01:56:27.529 --> 01:56:33.869]  When it's all right there and they are weather controlling and controlling hurricanes since the 60s.
[01:56:33.949 --> 01:56:35.029]  It's all declassified.
[01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:41.909]  And they don't want us to discuss that or understand that.
[01:56:42.409 --> 01:56:43.729]  So we sit here...
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:50.880]  Like, let's say you've got some sheep that you raise.
[01:56:51.079 --> 01:56:55.399]  You live in New Zealand. And the sheep don't know how to make a phone call.
[01:56:55.479 --> 01:56:57.600]  They don't know how to drive a tractor. They don't know how to build a house.
[01:56:58.159 --> 01:56:59.260]  And they're sitting there.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:03.380]  And every year or so, they get sheared for their wool.
[01:57:03.539 --> 01:57:10.279]  And every few months, they pick out a few of the sheep that they want to sell to be chopped up as lamb chops.
[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:14.149]  And they have no idea that's going on.
[01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:15.369]  Well, you're not a sheep.
[01:57:15.369 --> 01:57:18.569]  You're not an animal in the classic sense.
[01:57:18.789 --> 01:57:19.829]  You have free will.
[01:57:19.930 --> 01:57:20.949]  You have understanding of your environment.
[01:57:21.029 --> 01:57:24.909]  You can affect your environment. But you have to have an attitude like that.
[01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:34.449]  And you have to want to be successful not to dominate or show off to your neighbors, but so you're independent of the system and so you can help others.
[01:57:34.649 --> 01:57:36.390]  So we have to build alternate systems.
[01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:38.569]  Why don't they want organic farms?
[01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:40.050]  Leninguardian. Organic farms are the worst.
[01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:43.390]  UN wants to ban them. Amish need to be shut down.
[01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:48.710]  They're bad. Because you can't have a control group that lives 10 years longer and doesn't get autism.
[01:57:52.029 --> 01:57:54.310]  And you can't have communities that are self-sufficient.
[01:57:54.590 --> 01:58:03.449]  So this whole project is about destroying self-sufficiency, domesticating you, dumbing you down, poisoning you, and getting rid of you in an orderly fashion.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:08.220]  And I told you decades ago, they'll start with a man-made virus to scare everybody.
[01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:09.920]  They'll kill a certain number of people.
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:11.539]  The hospitals will be upset.
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:14.119]  They'll cover it up because they don't want to get in trouble.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.199]  Then they've set the president to launch a bigger attack.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:19.300]  I understand their methodology.
[01:58:19.779 --> 01:58:22.899]  I understand their modus operandi.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:26.060]  I understand how the globalist formulas work.
[01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:31.970]  I can talk about enemy plans, even though I haven't seen some of the newest documents.
[01:58:32.170 --> 01:58:37.930]  And then a year later, documents come out that are word for word what I said, and people say, how did you know this?
[01:58:37.989 --> 01:58:40.470]  It's because I don't need to even see the documents.
[01:58:40.609 --> 01:58:44.909]  I can see their whole program in front of me and how it interconnects and operates.
[01:58:45.029 --> 01:58:46.350]  And they don't have full control yet.
[01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:49.029]  They're far from it. And they're losing control of what they had.
[01:58:50.989 --> 01:58:56.729]  Your compliance with them, starting with your mind and your soul, is how they win.
[01:58:56.989 --> 01:58:59.970]  So you start by questioning and you start by researching.
[01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.409]  People always love a rumor.
[01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:06.670]  Oh, my cousin knows somebody in the military.
[01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:07.930]  They're getting ready for martial law.
[01:59:08.029 --> 01:59:09.170]  That story gets 20 million views.
[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:23.909]  Meanwhile, I've got Jamie Raskin and John Podesta and the Democrats and the funding getting ready for civil war and civil war conditions and civil emergency and the FBI saying right-wingers are going to They're going to have to arrest us all.
[01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:33.130]  And I show you the documents, and I show you the emergency orders, and I have General Flynn in here, the former head of Defense Intelligence Agency, showing you the executive orders last week, and it gets a million views.
[01:59:34.029 --> 01:59:40.909]  Got the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the former head of the National Security Advisor, up here for 87 minutes is how long he was live on air.
[01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:43.609]  That's how long it was once we went from live and posted it.
[01:59:46.489 --> 01:59:50.170]  Every clip of that interview should be its own video with 10 million views.
[01:59:51.789 --> 01:59:56.689]  But because it's real, people get threatened by it, but they love rumors.
[01:59:56.930 --> 02:00:00.250]  And of course people are talking to their cousin that's in the military and they're gearing up for that.
[02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:02.369]  But why do you go off of some hearsay?
[02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:05.529]  Why do you just say, oh, I heard they're controlling the weather.
[02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:09.649]  When I just showed you in the first hour and a half, massive proof, I'm about to show you more.
[02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:30.670]  What did they do 15, 16 years ago when I did an hour on chemicals in the water, namely atrazine, that you put the allowable amount that the government says is okay and it makes the vast majority of the frogs sterile and makes the majority of them want to have sex with other males so their population collapses.
[02:00:30.869 --> 02:00:33.789]  It does the same thing to every other species, every other family.
[02:00:34.710 --> 02:00:39.609]  Mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, all of it.
[02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:44.880]  Fries them. Not to mention all the cancer and the others.
[02:00:46.079 --> 02:00:47.920]  Deformities just gets worse from there.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.920]  They take an hour-long thing, as we found on the original show.
[02:00:52.039 --> 02:00:56.680]  We ought to get that on X. I forgot to do that about a month ago when Chase ran across it.
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.159]  The whole famous gay frogs rant.
[02:00:59.399 --> 02:01:03.119]  They just got me at the end saying, look, this isn't about hating gay people.
[02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:06.890]  And it is. Most of it's chemical.
[02:01:07.289 --> 02:01:09.489]  They're just confused. It's not that they're actually, you know, that.
[02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:12.489]  It changes in the embryo.
[02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:15.430]  All embryos are female at first, and they express the male.
[02:01:15.689 --> 02:01:23.069]  You put a little bit of atrazine in there, and it makes a lot of your physiology and your brain hemaphroditic.
[02:01:23.869 --> 02:01:25.770]  So the males are getting smaller, weaker.
[02:01:25.909 --> 02:01:28.689]  Penises are smaller. You can hate these people all day.
[02:01:28.689 --> 02:01:33.829]  I don't. Most of them are literally been chemically altered embryonically.
[02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:38.789]  And I said, I don't hate those people.
[02:01:38.850 --> 02:01:40.270]  I understand they're mutants.
[02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:43.449]  We're all mutants to a certain extent.
[02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:44.750]  White people are all mutants.
[02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:47.130]  In our chromosomes, we're recessive.
[02:01:48.630 --> 02:01:54.029]  But the point is, is that they're accelerating the mutation process.
[02:01:54.210 --> 02:02:01.170]  They admit they're testing mRNA to kill a bunch of people to get all sorts of new gene expression that they're looking for in this mass test.
[02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:07.619]  That's also a part of it. So, What do they go with?
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:14.600]  The thing at the end, hitting my papers on the table, saying this isn't about hating gay people, it's about not putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:17.949]  And depopulate the frogs and the humans by extension.
[02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:28.829]  They took that one thing that could make it sound like it wasn't scientific and ran with that to discredit anybody else that ever came around with the science that I just covered for an hour.
[02:02:29.170 --> 02:02:41.970]  So they tried to take the good I do and twist it and turn it into something bad they could use with all the TV shows and all the comedy late night shows all attacking me because they were worried about people figuring out about endocrine disruptors.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:48.680]  Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, everybody else talking about it.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:52.039]  And then it boomeranged back and they went, wait, Alex Jones said all this.
[02:02:53.279 --> 02:02:55.640]  They're making the frogs gay and it didn't work.
[02:02:55.819 --> 02:02:58.460]  Whatever the enemy throws at us is turned against them.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.479]  No weapon formed against us shall what?
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.939]  Prosper. So I've seen how God works.
[02:03:09.939 --> 02:03:13.859]  So, I want to go to break here in a few minutes.
[02:03:14.979 --> 02:03:21.859]  And I want to come back. And I want to get into the rest of the news on weather weapons for everybody.
[02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:26.470]  But when I say breakaway civilization, they're building their own world.
[02:03:26.890 --> 02:03:28.630]  They're in the year 2050, basically.
[02:03:28.930 --> 02:03:30.029]  That's a dead reckoning number.
[02:03:30.409 --> 02:03:31.770]  But in their own stuff, they say that.
[02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:34.270]  They've already decided where they want to take us.
[02:03:34.489 --> 02:03:37.510]  We have to understand the world they're building that's a post-human world.
[02:03:37.590 --> 02:03:39.789]  They believe they're going to have a new species that's going to rise.
[02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:45.350]  They've decided they're in the position of controlled evolution, in their words, whether you believe that or not.
[02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:49.649]  And they have taken control of...
[02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:53.689]  Human destiny. And I'm saying these are really bad, selfish people.
[02:03:53.869 --> 02:03:56.989]  We shouldn't allow that to happen, and we should change that.
[02:03:57.170 --> 02:04:10.310]  And I told you decades ago, I believe because God told me and I know that there will come a time when this stuff goes from beta to operational, that humanity will then rise up and understand this, and we will course-correct.
[02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:11.850]  It's going to be rough, but it'll still happen.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.000]  Now I told you that decades before it happened.
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:20.539]  You're now witnessing what I told you happening.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:26.880]  So I want you to have courage and beyond faith knowing because you're seeing it happen.
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:28.579]  Yes, faith is important. It's key.
[02:04:29.159 --> 02:04:36.739]  But God has set this up where you can see it now in your face.
[02:04:38.279 --> 02:04:40.060]  Because God knows we're up against a lot.
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.060]  God understands that, obviously.
[02:04:42.979 --> 02:04:51.800]  And so we're being given the greatest discernment and the greatest tools, and God's got his hand on Trump and hand on you.
[02:04:51.899 --> 02:04:58.779]  And when you just trust in God and walk in faith and do the right thing and stand up for what's right, you're incredibly powerful.
[02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:01.340]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:07.680]  Come back, and I will blitzkrieg through all this news and show you the documents that I mentioned earlier in the first hour and into the second.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:12.279]  And again, I know it's critical we stay on air.
[02:05:12.869 --> 02:05:14.189]  I know history's happening now.
[02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:18.869]  I know everything we do today is having a bigger effect than anything we did before because our credibility's so high.
[02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:22.729]  Your credibility's so high. People's minds are ready and souls for the truth.
[02:05:23.569 --> 02:05:33.289]  But it takes capital to do that, and I make it so easy to support the broadcast, whether they shut down InfoWars or not, by supporting our sponsors at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:05:33.449 --> 02:05:35.130]  They sold out of Nexol Financial Energy.
[02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:37.630]  They got a limited supply back in yesterday.
[02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:39.449]  It is not a stimulant.
[02:05:40.909 --> 02:05:52.609]  It is the concentrate breakdown of what your cells operate on as their main energy source, folic acid.
[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:55.210]  It becomes methylfolate.
[02:05:56.810 --> 02:06:02.489]  And then it's got all these other compounds and B-complex in it that's supercharged into the cells.
[02:06:02.710 --> 02:06:12.989]  It turbocharges cellular energy, cleans them out, Power's the mitochondria, and within 30 minutes of taking it, you feel a lot of energy, but there's no letdown.
[02:06:14.710 --> 02:06:17.029]  And you take it at night, you sleep better.
[02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:18.770]  You take it in the day, you have more energy.
[02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:26.859]  It's next level. That's why it's Next Level Foundational Energy, exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.539]  Cabot chill is incredible. Not a depressant, but it relaxes you in a focused way.

[02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:32.949]  They got a limited run of these.
[02:07:33.029 --> 02:07:34.890]  It's from the top producer in the country, top rated.
[02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:38.470]  They let our sponsor private label it.
[02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:42.069]  Limited supply, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:07:43.609 --> 02:07:46.750]  And when you're there, amazing t-shirts, hoodies, ball caps, limited editions.
[02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:51.090]  It's all to raise funds, keep this operation on the air one way or another.
[02:07:51.170 --> 02:07:52.350]  It's a big sponsor for InfoWars.
[02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:53.909]  Whatever happens there, hopefully we get a good buyer.
[02:07:53.989 --> 02:07:56.449]  We already have them. Will they be outbid on the 13th of November?
[02:07:56.529 --> 02:07:59.489]  We don't know. But regardless, they're pledged and they're doing it.
[02:08:00.329 --> 02:08:03.029]  Lots of stuff going on behind the scenes to make sure we don't miss...
[02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:05.569]  Step. We come out of the gate.
[02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:08.510]  If they do, shut this down. And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:08:08.569 --> 02:08:09.850]  It's beyond critical. Take action now.

[02:08:19.409 --> 02:08:28.310]  Stay with us. We're talking about weather weapons.
[02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:29.649]  All right. There's...
[02:08:29.649 --> 02:08:31.529]  There's no...
[02:08:32.359 --> 02:08:35.619]  Way to start this with the most important part because there's so much.
[02:08:35.739 --> 02:08:36.859]  I'm just going to show you a bunch of documents.
[02:08:36.939 --> 02:08:40.119]  You can write all this down. If you're watching on TV, you can get screenshots of it.
[02:08:40.119 --> 02:08:41.260]  Look up everything I'm showing you.
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:51.060]  UN world treaties, US government laws, certified hurricane control documents, 1960s.
[02:08:53.979 --> 02:08:58.369]  It's all there. And again, I covered it all in the first and second hour.
[02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:00.069]  We'll take this and put it on the end of that.
[02:09:00.289 --> 02:09:01.550]  Post it on X later today.
[02:09:01.810 --> 02:09:05.930]  People need to watch it. Not just you that's watching this live right now.
[02:09:06.869 --> 02:09:24.170]  But on top of the fact that the government can control hurricanes and can kill this hurricane and could have killed the last one, could have already killed Milton, you have them blocking aid in North and South Carolina and Georgia and other areas.
[02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:30.609]  And you have them now lying and not just giving a billion illegal aliens, but having a secret $7 billion.
[02:09:31.529 --> 02:09:32.909]  That's all over the news now.
[02:09:33.710 --> 02:09:35.109]  That's Mayorkas for you, yeah.
[02:09:35.670 --> 02:09:37.170]  He's a giant human trafficker.
[02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:38.689]  He's an anti-American criminal.
[02:09:38.869 --> 02:09:40.470]  He's Lex Luthor for real.
[02:09:42.289 --> 02:09:48.109]  Watchdog found $7 billion in untapped FEMA funds, even though DHS Secretary Mayorkas said none available.
[02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:50.010]  I have Fox News reporting it.
[02:09:52.399 --> 02:10:06.539]  Then you've got Dorsey asked KJP why Biden-Harris admin can't send immediate funding to Lebanon, can send money to Lebanon without Congress's backing, but can't do the same for additional disaster funds in North Carolina.
[02:10:07.039 --> 02:10:08.439]  She calls it misinformation.
[02:10:08.779 --> 02:10:10.340]  We don't want to answer. They just call it misinformation.
[02:10:10.859 --> 02:10:12.060]  The old word was conspiracy theory.
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:17.279]  It's a fact. Got a clip of her saying we're giving the money to illegal aliens in 2022.
[02:10:17.659 --> 02:10:18.859]  Now she says it's misinformation.
[02:10:18.859 --> 02:10:22.340]  It doesn't exist. You want me to play the clip for you?
[02:10:22.739 --> 02:10:24.119]  No, it's all over the place.
[02:10:25.119 --> 02:10:26.340]  Hell, just go ahead and play it.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.920]  Go ahead and play it. Categorically false.
[02:10:29.539 --> 02:10:31.859]  It is not true. It is a false statement.
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:38.420]  No, Biden did not take FEMA relief money to use on migrants.
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:50.840]  Funding is also available through FEMA's emergency food and shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants.
[02:10:51.399 --> 02:10:53.279]  Okay, but it's misinformation.
[02:10:54.239 --> 02:10:55.539]  And then we've got Kamala.
[02:10:56.409 --> 02:11:04.689]  With a shovel video where she obviously has never had a shovel in her hand and like stabs the ground with it.
[02:11:05.970 --> 02:11:08.310]  I mean, I shouldn't laugh at this.
[02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:14.670]  I mean, how did they find an idiot this dumb?
[02:11:16.909 --> 02:11:19.409]  All right, let me show you this first and I'll plow into the documents.
[02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:23.470]  Breaking. Lawmakers briefed on weather modification tech...
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:30.560]  To conclude, Hurricane Helena was DOD-linked weather weapon deployed against American people.
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.300]  Kind of a big deal. That's on Infowars.com.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.859]  All right. There's no way to start with the most important document, because depending on how you research it, it's all important.
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:47.539]  But let me just start running through documents and mainstream news articles for you, so you can go look this up for yourself when they say, Alex Jones claims, you know, that it's a weather weapon.
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:51.760]  There's no such thing. And when I say they're saying it, they're already saying it everywhere.
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:54.520]  Almost science fiction.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:57.739]  NOAA.gov. And they've been removing this, by the way.
[02:11:59.039 --> 02:12:00.159]  Almost science fiction.
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:02.020]  Hurricane modification and Project Storm Fury.
[02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:03.619]  National Weather Service.
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.619]  1960s to the 1980s.
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:14.420]  Total control of hurricanes. And those very type of aircraft you see here, they're still using those exact ones, taking off and flying into Helena and into Milton.
[02:12:16.539 --> 02:12:19.439]  And flying around in circles doing exactly you-know-what.
[02:12:20.649 --> 02:12:23.630]  7th anniversary of the first hurricane seeding experiment.
[02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:25.569]  NOAA.gov.
[02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:27.890]  See that? They're removing all this stuff.
[02:12:29.250 --> 02:12:30.390]  Project Storm Fury.
[02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:31.890]  Wikipedia. Go read about it.
[02:12:33.729 --> 02:12:34.810]  And now you've got it.
[02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:36.949]  One of the biggest hurricanes ever, up to 180 miles an hour.
[02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:40.989]  Milton. All right.
[02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:46.350]  Don't worry. We've got fact checkers saying...
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.340]  That I'm saying we need to get the lithium.
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:52.680]  I'm not the one saying that. Aggressional reports on it.
[02:12:54.619 --> 02:13:02.840]  The footage I showed in the last hour, the hour before, of the planes going around, shipped by the Weather Service and by the Department of Energy to control the hurricane.
[02:13:04.739 --> 02:13:09.920]  All the different little HAARP facilities all over the Western world, like in England, to control the weather.
[02:13:12.279 --> 02:13:17.489]  You got the... People like Axelrod saying this is great, it's keeping conservative areas from voting.
[02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:19.810]  Played that video, audio yesterday.
[02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:30.850]  But right now, and I've got all the footage inside the government aircraft of the chemtrailing, geoengineering, videos, CBS admitting lasers controlling the weather.
[02:13:32.029 --> 02:13:46.840]  The head of the program under Operation Popeye for the CIA and the Navy and the Air Force, Ben Livingston, played those clips two hours ago, Make Mud Not War, how the U.S. weather warfare in Vietnam, The Guardian, Operation Popeye, you can read all about it.
[02:13:48.359 --> 02:13:53.560]  Environmental Modification Convention of the United Nations, 1977-78.
[02:13:53.859 --> 02:14:01.399]  You can go to the UN. This is StateDepartment.gov and read all about the weather control treaties they signed back then.
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:04.140]  They agreed not to tell the public about it in the treaty.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.760]  The details, Environmental Modification Convention.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.979]  Then they are now telling the public about it slowly.
[02:14:13.239 --> 02:14:15.619]  Let the telegraph scientists step closer to steering hurricanes.
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:18.340]  Oh, in a perfect circle, getting it to go where they want.
[02:14:18.899 --> 02:14:21.180]  Just like it does in the actual flight pass.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.479]  See how that works? Scientists think they can control the weather with lasers.
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:33.079]  CBS News. All right.
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.239]  Now let's go into some documents.
[02:14:38.699 --> 02:14:46.140]  Okay, this is publication 94-490, October 13, 1976.
[02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:55.659]  94th Congress, public law ahead of the UN ratifying the law on the Weather Modification Convention.
[02:14:57.399 --> 02:14:58.899]  The law passed.
[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:01.699]  Here's the law for you.
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:04.960]  Public law 94-490.
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:06.399]  94th Congress.
[02:15:10.090 --> 02:15:11.569]  Alright, here's another one.
[02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:17.149]  Patent granted for a system that manipulates hurricanes.
[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:18.710]  We'll show you the patent in a moment.
[02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:20.350]  Oh, what's it used?
[02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:23.649]  This is in 2003.
[02:15:25.869 --> 02:15:30.170]  The head of the HAARP program at the current time on in 2006.
[02:15:30.949 --> 02:15:33.189]  For some reason, the Pentagon called.
[02:15:33.329 --> 02:15:35.909]  The Air Force colonel said that the head of the HAARP program is a civilian.
[02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:37.810]  He wants to come on your show for some reason.
[02:15:38.529 --> 02:15:47.859]  He came on. And admitted they control the weather and can actually light the atmosphere on fire with HAARP. They built systems everywhere, and they thought, I should know that.
[02:15:48.779 --> 02:15:55.840]  Interview's out there. And here it is with HAARP Systems, How to Control a Hurricane, U.S. Patent Application Publication.
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:05.479]  It was granted. And that's 2003-0085-296, May 8, 2003.
[02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:14.949]  And it goes over how to control it, how to steer them, how to kill them, how to make them stronger, how to make them weaker, all using Doppler radar.
[02:16:15.250 --> 02:16:24.930]  And they've got giant floating mobile oil drilling platforms with huge control systems in the Gulf, the Atlantic, and they deploy it against the American people.
[02:16:24.989 --> 02:16:34.989]  That's how they steer it. They have all the figures there, how they do it, how they make clouds bigger, how they make them rain, how they dissipate clouds, it's all right there.
[02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:37.110]  Read all the science on that.
[02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:42.229]  They're just going to call this disinformation.
[02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:45.610]  Oh, hey, you want to ban semi-autos?
[02:16:45.690 --> 02:16:50.049]  Come on. Nope, disinformation. Hey, you said you gave the money to illegal aliens from FEMA. Disinformation.
[02:16:50.729 --> 02:16:52.309]  Doesn't matter if you have the clip, doesn't matter if I just showed it to you.
[02:16:53.610 --> 02:16:55.590]  Hey, you say X and Y chromosomes don't exist.
[02:16:55.590 --> 02:17:01.690]  That's right, disinformation. Here's one, also from the federal government.
[02:17:01.809 --> 02:17:04.030]  Electromagnetic system to modify weather.
[02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:06.870]  Big giant report on that.
[02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:09.709]  Another patent.
[02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:16.489]  Complex artificial electromagnetic field array for particle fusion.
[02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:20.969]  Confinement in yield larger elements.
[02:17:21.170 --> 02:17:25.850]  That gets into weather control. Propagating sound through bodies of water to generate direct wind.
[02:17:26.049 --> 02:17:29.579]  The purposes of... Moderating the affected weather patterns.
[02:17:30.719 --> 02:17:32.280]  That's again the federal government.
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:36.700]  CIA.gov.
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:40.260]  Worldwide countries likely to expand weather modification efforts.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.399]  Huge links to huge studies right here.
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:45.639]  Weather modification. Current intelligence weekly summary.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:55.719]  Survey on weather modification, R&D program planning guidance on government operations of weather control, analytical summary, possible environmental restraints, environmental warfare.
[02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:57.340]  And what do you think we're under right now?
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.459]  This is like 20 pages long.
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:05.739]  Let me keep reading. Number seven, Central Intelligence Bulletin on the Russians using weather weapons.
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:15.020]  Weather modification, the Weather Services Environmental Science Services Administration, Weekly Surveyor, International Aspects of Weather Modification.
[02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:18.209]  Let me keep reading all this to you.
[02:18:18.450 --> 02:18:24.309]  Climate, geoengineering, a growing foreign policy and public perceptions challenge, but currently a low technical threat.

[02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:46.899]  Yep, there it is. Let me show you another one on Bill Gates.
[02:18:47.579 --> 02:18:49.899]  This is Fox News, also Forbes.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:56.760]  A Bill Gates venture aims to spray dust in the atmosphere to block the sun.

[02:20:01.690 --> 02:20:05.069]  Alrighty. This is an interesting document right here.
[02:20:05.129 --> 02:20:08.350]  You might want to read. Weather and climate modification.
[02:20:09.569 --> 02:20:15.809]  A report... And a special commission in weather modification, National Science Foundation.

[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:53.819]  It goes through it all. Now, the conclusion by the late 80s was, don't ever tell the public about this, just do it.
[02:20:53.899 --> 02:20:56.920]  And I already played the CIA director earlier under Obama saying it.
[02:20:58.979 --> 02:21:01.940]  All right? You see, this is a whole book they printed, Overhead Shop Place.
[02:21:03.219 --> 02:21:04.940]  You might just want to go read this.
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.340]  And this was republished.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:09.420]  It was updated in the 80s.

[02:21:24.989 --> 02:21:26.549]  And people will be like, where will we get it?
[02:21:26.649 --> 02:21:28.370]  I know when this is on X later, we're streaming it.
[02:21:28.549 --> 02:21:30.270]  It'll be like, show me the leak!
[02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:38.889]  It's like last week when the Democrats filed in Austin Court to take over the company on the hearings the 17th to be the 18th.
[02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:45.729]  I posted like five things on X with the document and then later the full show went up and I saw the comments go, where is it?
[02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:46.809]  We don't believe it.
[02:21:46.809 --> 02:21:55.790]  It's not real. You just type in weather and climate modification report on the special commission on weather modification.
[02:21:56.170 --> 02:21:57.549]  National Science Foundation.
[02:21:58.110 --> 02:22:01.290]  Or just type in National Science Foundation climate modification.
[02:22:01.729 --> 02:22:03.870]  Show everybody on Google for TV viewers.
[02:22:03.969 --> 02:22:06.090]  Just type in and show them. Okay.
[02:22:06.329 --> 02:22:08.530]  I can lead a horse to water but I can't make it drink.
[02:22:11.219 --> 02:22:21.319]  So, that is just a small smattering of what we've got for you.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:25.719]  Oh, look, they typed in what I said, depending on weather modification.
[02:22:25.899 --> 02:22:27.079]  Oh, look, U.S. Department of Defense.
[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:28.899]  Oh, look, weather modification.
[02:22:29.059 --> 02:22:30.559]  Wikipedia. Oh, look, National Science Foundation.
[02:22:30.659 --> 02:22:33.000]  Oh, there it is. Oh, God, Third Link, so hard to do.
[02:22:33.479 --> 02:22:34.620]  Where is it, Alex?
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:35.940]  Where is it, Alex?
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:38.659]  Where is it? 13 weeks ago.
[02:22:39.319 --> 02:22:41.700]  There's armed security here to close the building and kick me out.
[02:22:41.819 --> 02:22:43.280]  I'm going to call the police. I'm not leaving.
[02:22:44.239 --> 02:22:45.340]  Show us the people.
[02:22:46.639 --> 02:22:51.520]  Show us the people. We go stick a camera in their face and have a confrontation?
[02:22:53.159 --> 02:22:54.340]  And then two days later, the news.
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:56.239]  Yeah, they came to close it, but Jones won't leave.
[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:57.700]  We want it shut down.
[02:22:57.899 --> 02:23:02.020]  And the court fired the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department.
[02:23:03.899 --> 02:23:05.319]  Bum-rushing us. What did I say?
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:07.780]  I said, they're getting ready to kill Trump. That's stupid.
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:10.340]  It wasn't about me. They know I've got their number.
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:13.920]  They know I'd go on air day one and say it was a stand-down by the Secret Service.
[02:23:15.139 --> 02:23:18.059]  And I said, when I saw Ronald Rowe, I said, he's the one who actually runs things.
[02:23:18.079 --> 02:23:19.600]  This lady's a puppet. He's behind it.
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:23.459]  He's behind the stand-down. It came out a month later that he ordered the stand-down and lied to Congress.
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:24.700]  I've got their number.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:25.819]  I've got their ass.
[02:23:25.879 --> 02:23:35.979]  This is all I do. So I'm going to say what I said at the start of the show.
[02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:40.850]  Two hours and 51 minutes ago, and I'm going to say it again now in case you just tuned in.
[02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:44.030]  The government is a breakaway civilization.
[02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:45.110]  They're mad scientists.
[02:23:45.649 --> 02:23:46.969]  They treat us like children.
[02:23:47.049 --> 02:23:54.889]  We act like children. They're doing all this genetic engineering and all this chemical manipulation and all this weather control and all this other insanity.
[02:23:55.989 --> 02:23:58.610]  Blame God. You can go research it.
[02:23:59.549 --> 02:24:02.450]  Enough stuff to send them all to prison 10 million times as public.
[02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:03.870]  Imagine what we don't know.
[02:24:07.709 --> 02:24:11.110]  And it's a life and death situation to get people to understand this.
[02:24:11.209 --> 02:24:13.809]  Plus, it's incredible. It's wild to learn all this.
[02:24:13.930 --> 02:24:16.489]  It's cool and fun to fight evil.
[02:24:16.489 --> 02:24:17.809]  It's great to get involved.
[02:24:17.989 --> 02:24:19.670]  It's great to know about all this stuff.
[02:24:19.989 --> 02:24:22.909]  And I just feel like everybody's like me, and more and more people are.
[02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:36.030]  But you know, when I was sitting, visiting in the summer of Christmas down here in Austin from Dallas, and my mother's father, my grandfather, would just sit there at the breakfast table for five hours.
[02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:37.870]  In his overalls.
[02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:39.430]  Or coveralls.
[02:24:41.629 --> 02:24:50.969]  What a character. We're like blue or gray or green overalls, coveralls, all the time in a Stetson cowboy hat.
[02:24:51.729 --> 02:25:07.989]  And he'd just talk about Berner Ron Braun and space station plans and ICBMs and MIRV technology and Pentagon weapon systems and the New World Order and chemicals in the food and My mother would say, your grandfather's a very eccentric man.
[02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:16.170]  And I talked to my mom years ago, like, well, Granddaddy talked about building that robot for the Pentagon.
[02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:18.370]  Yeah, we saw it at Berkshire.
[02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:19.770]  It was secret, but they let us see the robot.
[02:25:20.049 --> 02:25:22.510]  They never produced it, but they did buy the robot.
[02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:23.729]  He made some money on the robot.
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:31.260]  I remember when we were little, you know, Wernher von Braun visited UT and we went and saw him.
[02:25:31.319 --> 02:25:37.620]  I was just like, okay. So the point is, is that I guess I'm weird because I grew up around this.
[02:25:38.059 --> 02:25:44.159]  But you want to get weird real fast, people, because this is what's going on.
[02:25:44.239 --> 02:25:49.420]  This is what's happening. This is the whole shooting match.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.479]  And it's not that my family is that special.
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:26:02.100]  Though the government heavily tried to recruit corporations out of Texas, look at Ben Livingston's from Texas, the father of weather weapons, they tried to recruit my dad, and they did for a while.
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:21.659]  He was 14, because he won a bunch of Texas contests and science fair stuff, and they said, oh, do you want to join NASA? Let's see if you can build this Union carbide ruby laser in three days and write a report on it.
[02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:35.729]  And then an 18-wheeler a week later pulls up at the ranch and offloads giant crate with all the parts, with no blueprints, and my dad builds a laser and then wins that contest, like the last Starfighter or something.
[02:26:35.969 --> 02:26:37.989]  And that's what Eisenhower had set that up.
[02:26:38.370 --> 02:26:39.430]  Eisenhower was out of power.
[02:26:41.370 --> 02:26:44.850]  I guess that was like in 64, so it was LBJ, but it was an Eisenhower program.
[02:26:45.149 --> 02:26:51.750]  I'm going to tell you something, this is real. And that's how they were luring all the top brains in the country.
[02:26:52.129 --> 02:26:53.549]  We'll get this kid to join us.
[02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:59.229]  His mother was like, oh, he's winning all these contests.
[02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:03.709]  My son was to be in NASA. Oh, lady, we'll put your son in NASA, all right.
[02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:09.049]  And you know what his first job was when he was like 15 years old?
[02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:11.829]  Plan 2 UT, already going to UT when he was 14, 15?
[02:27:13.409 --> 02:27:15.489]  MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility.
[02:27:15.629 --> 02:27:17.270]  Oh, you want to go to the moon, son?
[02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:26.290]  Well, going to the moon starts in the secret experimentation facility with terminal cancer patients.
[02:27:26.549 --> 02:27:30.290]  And my dad told me about that when I was a kid, and I didn't really understand it until later.
[02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:33.090]  You know what he was doing in there?
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:40.120]  You think Fauci removing the larynxes of dogs and letting flesh-eating worms eat their heads?
[02:27:40.319 --> 02:27:42.639]  That's all a test for young people to see if they'll do it.
[02:27:43.059 --> 02:28:01.639]  Well, my dad told me that it was beyond any horror movie he ever saw, and it was hundreds and hundreds of people coming through dying a month who were missing their lower mandibles and stuff because they'd had their lower thing removed because of cancer surgery, and they would sign paperwork in a secret program to allow them to experiment with lethal stuff on them.
[02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:11.969]  And my dad said he thought it was good for the first year there, except he kept noticing the head scientist got off on killing people and would act like they were having an orgasm when they were killing people.
[02:28:12.069 --> 02:28:14.709]  That's a quote. So my dad said, I don't want to be part of this project.
[02:28:14.809 --> 02:28:16.770]  They said, oh, we got another project for you.
[02:28:18.569 --> 02:28:20.709]  And that's where my dad telling me stuff stops.
[02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:22.129]  He said, you don't want to get killed.
[02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:26.370]  So let me explain to you about this government.
[02:28:26.829 --> 02:28:30.610]  They're bad. Real bad.
[02:28:31.889 --> 02:28:33.129]  And that's in the 60s.
[02:28:33.309 --> 02:28:35.010]  You know what else was at UT you didn't tell me?
[02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:43.649]  They had CD-ROMs and computers that he didn't see deployed to the public in the late 80s in the mid-60s.
[02:28:43.989 --> 02:28:46.110]  He said the only thing different was the computer screens.
[02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:50.729]  And they have all under UT a whole military base with a nuclear reactor.
[02:28:51.309 --> 02:28:54.389]  Did you know that? That was secret until I broke that 20 years ago.
[02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:58.889]  I'm not talking about J.J. Pickle, nuclear reactor, research air reactor in North Austin.
[02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:02.790]  I'm talking about they got a nuclear reactor under UT. Did you know that?
[02:29:03.370 --> 02:29:07.170]  And again, that's just what my family saw and that's the tip of the iceberg.
[02:29:07.450 --> 02:29:09.790]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:29:10.409 --> 02:29:11.770]  You were never there.
[02:29:12.430 --> 02:29:14.930]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:29.260]  That thinks you're done and thinks you're over and we have to admit this is going on and realize we're in a science fiction dystopia movie that's real and it's only going to get worse the more we act like jellyfish.
[02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:36.139]  So no, I don't want to go play golf and I don't want to go out and get drunk and get a bunch of women and I don't want to act cool.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.139]  I already did all that. I want to save humanity.
[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:43.860]  I want you to wake up and realize of course they're controlling the hurricane.
[02:29:44.239 --> 02:29:45.260]  Of course they're in control.
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:46.600]  They could have killed it. They didn't do that.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:51.350]  They're convicted. Just as Dane Whittington said in the earlier report, he's on tomorrow.
[02:29:52.729 --> 02:29:54.129]  I can't do this without you.
[02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:55.690]  We're doing the most important work out there.
[02:29:55.770 --> 02:29:57.010]  It's all in God's plan.
[02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:59.670]  I humbly ask for your support at thealexjohnstore.com.
[02:29:59.850 --> 02:30:06.709]  We have the incredible superfood, CMOS, with next-level iodine and all the other trace elements that are just over-the-top incredible.
[02:30:06.829 --> 02:30:08.690]  It is the superfood. It is the hottest thing.
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:11.479]  It is at thealexshonesstore.com.
[02:30:11.579 --> 02:30:12.979]  The t-shirts, all of it. I need your support.
[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:15.559]  This is history. Why the hell wouldn't you want to come in for the big win?
[02:30:16.079 --> 02:30:22.659]  Thealexshonesstore.com. Donate to legal defense fund against the deep state CIA FBI attack at realalexshones.com.
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:30.260]  All right, I'm going to hit one final key document that I didn't get to that is probably one of the most important.
[02:30:31.639 --> 02:30:34.700]  This was declassified a decade ago.
[02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:36.440]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:30:38.819 --> 02:30:55.399]  This is the CIA secret memorandum to the Chief General Science Division of the Astrogeophysics Branch, Weather Modification,
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:31:03.000]  CIA, October 7th, 1965.
[02:31:03.739 --> 02:31:05.559]  And you want to read the whole document?
[02:31:07.829 --> 02:31:09.250]  Subject, weather modification.
[02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:18.950]  And you want to turn to this page here on screen, weather modification.
[02:31:20.649 --> 02:31:29.229]  It is clear that we must press forward to improve our ability to detect, track, and predict severe weather hazards.
[02:31:29.709 --> 02:31:42.530]  It is equally clear that the time has come For us to move vigorously forward to explore possibilities of modifying and controlling the weather in beneficial ways.
[02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:47.590]  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of weather modification to the nation at large.
[02:31:47.750 --> 02:32:11.250]  If we in the United States were to acquire the ability to modify the weather in a substantial way, which they're already doing, to augment precipitation, to blunt the thrust of hurricanes, or make them stronger, and other Severe storms to support and to suppress hail to crop areas,
[02:32:11.450 --> 02:32:21.129]  to crops with lightning and discharges in the forecast area, and to dissipate all types of fog, we could have an achievement of vast significance.
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:36.350]  We would be able to expand our national economy and to improve the well-being of the American people in ways that And to a degree that are now inconceivable.
[02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:43.030]  The ultimate benefits that weather modification can bring are almost unimaginable.
[02:32:44.489 --> 02:32:46.229]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:51.010]  I'm going to file a special report on all this, and it gets into weather weapons, all the rest of it.
[02:32:51.049 --> 02:32:52.729]  But they've been keeping this from the public.
[02:32:52.870 --> 02:33:00.469]  It's deployed, and it's being used as a weapons system, just like they turn off the Keystone Pipeline, just like they block aid, just like FEMA just got caught with weapons.
[02:33:03.139 --> 02:33:06.399]  $7 million of secret money, and they're blocking the aid recovery.
[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:16.420]  We know what they're doing. But remember, since the late 60s, and I covered it earlier, they have been able to control and kill and steer, strengthen or weaken hurricanes.
[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:21.040]  They could have killed the hurricane that hit and Milton that's about to hit.
[02:33:22.399 --> 02:33:27.879]  And that is the fact, and that's why I'm saying it lays at the feet of the Harris administration.
[02:33:28.959 --> 02:33:33.040]  Biden administration, it's really her now as the puppet, at least, and the placeholder in charge.
[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:35.639]  And this is such vital information.
[02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:37.600]  We're live right now. It's 203 Central.
