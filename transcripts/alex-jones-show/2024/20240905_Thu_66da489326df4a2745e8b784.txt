[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.905]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:12.592]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:30.926]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:32.907]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:48.254]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:50.635]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:57.899]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:29.498]  Right before your very eyes, a counter-government is forming, basing its control of your fellow citizens on content guidelines, vague hate speech punishment, and an emerging social credit system in a direct violation to our Bill of Rights.
[00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:34.039]  And this new Silicon Valley technocracy is only getting started.
[00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.101]  Is Google actually looking, not your own personal experiences searching, but are you assessing it empirically upon what data
[00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:49.164]  Do you make testimony in this committee that Google is not favoring in its search results one party over another or one candidate over another?
[00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:53.088]  As the Chief Privacy Officer of Google, this is not within my core domain.
[00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:56.592]  More than twice as many employees at Google have protested working with the U.S.
[00:01:56.652 --> 00:02:02.098]  military than have protested creating a censored search engine for China.
[00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:11.408]  Senator, I take a great deal of pride in the fact that Google is an organization that allows employees to voice their opinions.
[00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:21.733]  And we're continuing to work with the United States government, the Department of Defense in certain areas, including cybersecurity, healthcare, and productivity.
[00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:26.555]  But we are focusing on making sure that our collaborations with the government are consistent with our core values.
[00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:45.465]  Mr. Ryan, I'm very concerned about how people in China and other places where there are oppressive regimes will have access to technology that may change their lives, shift their lives when millions of people are imprisoned in political camps, internment camps, re-education centers because of their minority status or because of their religion.
[00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:46.746]  Churches are being bulldozed.
[00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.207]  I think it's very important that we have an open
[00:02:48.527 --> 00:02:51.449]  Forget Russian election meddling, the Chinese are making that look like child's play.
[00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.070]  Mikhail Thelin reports.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.222]  According to the DOJ's Office of Public Affairs, 27-year-old Xi Jiaoquan is alleged to have operated on U.S.
[00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:22.303]  soil as an illegal agent of the People's Republic of China.
[00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:25.004]  A criminal complaint and affidavit filed in U.S.
[00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:35.687]  District Court says Xi was directed by a high-level intelligence officer from China and tasked with obtaining information on individuals to help aid possible recruitment.
[00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:38.968]  The eight individuals included Chinese nationals who
[00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:43.231]  What could be said about Jamal Ahmed Khashoggi that hasn't already been said about Seth Rich?
[00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:43.872]  It's a big problem.
[00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.070]  The story he was working on proves the motivation.
[00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.551]  These are the type of stories that gets InfoWars de-platformed.
[00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:29.357]  In Myanmar, while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims, two Reuters journalists, Wah Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were imprisoned for seven years under an ancient law known as the Official Secrets Act, now revamped under the guise of fake news.
[00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:35.719]  Under Section 505B of the Myanmar Penal Code, a colonial-era law banning publication of
[00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:41.142]  If Congress continues to sit on its hands, then the First Amendment is essentially null and void in the United States.
[00:04:41.223 --> 00:04:45.625]  As an American, your vote this November could steer the United States into a wounded republic or a draconian leftist nightmare.
[00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:46.426]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.455]  All right, we've got massive insane news, huge guests, your calls.
[00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:09.216]  I plan to talk to Chad GPT again.
[00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:14.358]  People just really find it interesting, and so do I. It is Thursday, September 5th, 2024.
[00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:22.202]  But at the end of the day, you really have to ask yourself, do you support the Democrats, Soros, Biden, Kamala Harris, any of them?
[00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:24.143]  You really are a psychotic
[00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:27.722]  Demon or you are mentally retarded.
[00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:29.766]  Here's an important report on it.
[00:05:29.806 --> 00:05:31.209]  We'll launch the full transmission.
[00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.834]  Please spread the word because you are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.579]  These fabulations have been common on the fringes for years.
[00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.022]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:51.406]  But now, his name saturates nearly every corner of the GOP ecosystem.
[00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:57.712]  The longtime investor and philanthropist became the target of misinformation and conspiracies starting in the 1990s.
[00:05:58.212 --> 00:06:05.219]  Extremists in the US and Europe cast him as a central figure in a secret cabal of Jews and globalists working to take over the world.
[00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.340]  The economy has actually been humming along.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.122]  Questions about whether or not it's been financed in the right way and who's going to get the benefits of it, but they haven't been running on that.
[00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:15.202]  They've been running on an imaginary caravan.
[00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:25.826]  If the mainstream media actually began reporting facts again, they would quickly learn that the migrant caravans are not only a reality, but they are no accident.
[00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:28.327]  Back in July of 2018, Reuters reported on the 193 UN member nations.
[00:06:32.028 --> 00:06:35.451]  that entered into a non-binding mass global migration pact.
[00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:51.384]  Miroslav Lajkic, President of the UN General Assembly, told a media briefing, the official global compact for safe, orderly, and regular migration addresses why people migrate, how to protect them, and how to integrate them into new countries.
[00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:59.211]  However, the United States, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, and the Czech Republic have pulled out of the pact.
[00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.131]  The U.S.
[00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:07.315]  had previously entered into the pact under Barack Obama, regardless of the fact that the pact violates our immigration laws.
[00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:10.237]  The pact states that it is rooted in the U.N.'
[00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:16.160]  's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.682]  The Addis Ababa Action Agenda was a conference held in Ethiopia in July of 2015.
[00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:32.187]  This agenda stated, we will work to ensure that adequate and affordable financial services are available to migrants and their families in both home and host countries.
[00:07:32.427 --> 00:07:46.153]  And this is nothing new to Soros and USAID, who funneled money to aid Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003, the Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan's Tulip Revolution in 2005.
[00:07:47.113 --> 00:07:51.515]  Judicial Watch used a FOIA request to uncover how USAID funds
[00:07:51.755 --> 00:08:03.658]  We're funneled to Soros' left-wing open society foundations in Albania, particularly the Soros Operation efforts to give the socialist government greater control of the judiciary.
[00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:14.920]  USAID reportedly gave $9 million in 2016 to the Justice for All campaign, which is overseen by Soros' East-West Management Institute.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:26.004]  Also, the New York Times reported Mr. Soros has given his main group, the Open Society Foundation, $32 billion for what it calls democracy-building efforts in the United States and around the world.
[00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:36.948]  In addition, in the United States, Mr. Soros has personally contributed more than $75 million over the years to federal candidates and committees, according to the FEC and the IRS.
[00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:43.751]  A MasterCard press release boasted, MasterCard and George Soros announced plans called Humanity Ventures.
[00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:52.214]  The enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities around the world, especially refugees and migrants.
[00:08:52.474 --> 00:09:00.496]  With the creation of Humanity Ventures, Soros could invest up to $50 million to make these solutions even more scalable and sustainable.
[00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:11.180]  Slovenian outlet Nova24 reported, a Croatian officer stated, the migrants we catch and return back in a few days or weeks are again trying to break into Croatia.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.022]  Some of them are really poor, but many are well-equipped.
[00:09:14.202 --> 00:09:22.710]  They have new footwear, new clothes, sophisticated smartphones, weapons, and some have also been found with MasterCard bank cards without name.
[00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.051]  They are just numbers.
[00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:28.375]  They withdraw money at ATMs, but we do not know who pays them.
[00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:35.841]  Essentially, the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and yes, George Soros and his Open Society Foundation
[00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:36.561]  We're good to go.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.025]  It's not anti-semitic to criticize Soros, and Israel issued a statement a year ago saying just that.
[00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:34.339]  So, when the media ignores a left-leaning foreign billionaire's wrecking ball on our national security based on their own manufactured globalist propaganda, what is left after the smoke clears is nothing less than treason.
[00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:36.461]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:45.055]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:55.537]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:10:56.337 --> 00:11:02.418]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:11:02.938 --> 00:11:07.439]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:11:14.255 --> 00:11:19.537]  ...do not always unite themselves in their recommendations to the makers of policy.
[00:11:20.798 --> 00:11:23.519]  This is only partly because of scientific disagreements.
[00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:33.043]  It is even more because the big issues so often go beyond the possibilities of exact scientific determination.
[00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:37.945]  As science of necessity becomes more involved with itself,
[00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:42.589]  So also of necessity, it becomes more international.
[00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:46.053]  Climate change has been a tug-of-war issue for years.
[00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:54.581]  And finally, a federal report today predicted possible catastrophic warming of the Earth by the 1990s with a strong climate change.
[00:11:55.021 --> 00:11:57.203]  You've heard the term, follow the money.
[00:11:58.064 --> 00:12:01.926]  And the money is from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.
[00:12:02.706 --> 00:12:12.310]  So in the name of green and environmental justice, there's over $40 billion that are going to be granted out through the EPA.
[00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:22.074]  The EPA granted $50 million to an organization called Climate Justice Alliance.
[00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:24.895]  This is what we found on the website.
[00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:29.040]  That our taxpayer dollars are going to organizations such as this.
[00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:35.110]  If you dig deeper, they want to defund the police, defund the military.
[00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:44.933]  Either them or their affiliates want to have very radical, drastic initiatives that I think are anti-American.
[00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:50.835]  Who knows how much more in the future and other like groups because there are other associated groups with this group.
[00:12:51.715 --> 00:12:56.777]  There's no Inspector General for EPA to follow the money because they don't care.
[00:12:57.817 --> 00:13:00.139]  Ecological warfare is a tool of colonialism.
[00:13:30.023 --> 00:13:40.251]  In every colonized place, there are ecological, political, and human crises compounded by the climate crisis.
[00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:44.714]  Climate change did not begin with the burning of fossil fuels.
[00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:50.459]  It began with settler colonialism, imperialism, and extractivism.
[00:13:53.610 --> 00:14:03.598]  Similarly with Palestine, if you start the clock of history at settler colonialism and the British Empire, a new set of liberatory solutions appear.
[00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.860]  So follow the money.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.603]  We're going to be doing that in the Environment and Public Works Committee.
[00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:10.804]  That's where the derivation of this was.
[00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:19.171]  And I find it rather startling to me that the EPA is not doing, and the administration, are not doing any
[00:14:19.952 --> 00:14:24.073]  Better research as to where our American taxpayer dollars are going.
[00:14:24.894 --> 00:14:30.716]  The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vehemently warned that the Earth is doomed.
[00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:38.578]  They said we are looking at an unprecedented amount of carbon, at least in the last 800,000 years.
[00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:44.260]  Meanwhile, anyone questioning the science is throttled by totalitarian threats.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.722]  Paul Dreesen, Senior Policy Analyst with Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.
[00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:51.243]  CFACT.org is the website.
[00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:55.424]  A climate change denying website is on the line with us.
[00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:56.705]  Paul, why should you not be in jail?
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.820]  I mean that is a serious question.
[00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.341]  You're taking money to deceive the public in a way that's killing people.
[00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:04.802]  But who did this research?
[00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:09.223]  Are they credible or are they connivers for the United Nations carbon tax scam?
[00:15:09.383 --> 00:15:19.786]  As the Daily Caller reported, the scientists who wrote the National Climate Assessment used unreliable information that exaggerates the risks global warming poses.
[00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:24.187]  You can now say everything's climate change and no matter what happens, it's all climate change.
[00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:34.436]  And the worst thing that could be done to humanity is put government bureaucrats in charge of carbon dioxide emissions or whatever it would be.
[00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:42.725]  Because there's no way to have a definitive science on something so nebulous and so foolish as climate change.
[00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:45.047]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:15:49.853 --> 00:15:50.053]  All right.
[00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:55.675]  I don't normally air special reports for the first 16 minutes of the show, but I did today because those are really important.
[00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:59.337]  And they just got filed yesterday and today, and they needed to be seen.
[00:16:00.097 --> 00:16:03.678]  And really looking at them, I said, this is just as important as anything I'm going to say on air.
[00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:06.479]  It's just incredible.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.040]  All right.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.622]  We'll be live here for the next three hours and 43 minutes.
[00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:16.423]  And then Owen Schroeder takes over at 3 p.m.
[00:16:17.023 --> 00:16:17.583]  Central today.
[00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:18.784]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:27.042]  And we have a lot of just incredibly important news, as we always do, to cover and go over here.
[00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:45.637]  But piercing through all of that, the elephant in the room is the Democratic Party has been surveilling and censoring election information to skew and manipulate the public into accepting that the Democrats are stealing the election again.
[00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:47.879]  And even in Europe,
[00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:53.328]  They operate similarly with these mail-in ballots and these dropbox ballots.
[00:16:53.388 --> 00:17:10.221]  And the fastest growing party in Germany, an alternative for Deutschland that's been winning a lot of the local elections and gaining the most seats per parliamentary election, is trying to pass a law right now that you don't have these mail-in ballots and you don't have these dropbox ballots as well.
[00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:12.603]  So that's really how they're doing it.
[00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:18.007]  And with 60 days to the election, I feel like we're in a slow-motion car wreck here.
[00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:24.871]  Where you're driving through the green light, and you look over, and some idiots run the red light, and you go, oh boy, I'm about to get t-boned.
[00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:33.514]  You make the split-second decision, do I jam on the accelerator so they hit the back of the car, or do I slam on the brakes so they hit the front of the car, or can I miss them?
[00:17:34.335 --> 00:17:37.236]  And then you make the other split-second decision,
[00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:43.164]  Well, maybe I can just jam the accelerator on and there's no cars to the right of me.
[00:17:43.224 --> 00:17:44.224]  I can just jump over.
[00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:58.733]  And just about, I don't know, six months ago, I was driving off of Barton Creek Boulevard onto Southwest Parkway.
[00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:03.186]  And I almost always look left and right and really careful, but I was busy.
[00:18:03.226 --> 00:18:04.066]  The phone was ringing.
[00:18:05.027 --> 00:18:08.350]  Quite frankly, I was getting answers, so it would go on the Bluetooth.
[00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:10.432]  And then the light turned green.
[00:18:12.093 --> 00:18:14.275]  And I was in the lead car, and I pulled out.
[00:18:15.236 --> 00:18:21.421]  And some maniac in a truck, going 70 miles an hour, was coming right at me.
[00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:24.624]  And I made the decision, split second,
[00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:30.104]  Because I knew I had cars right behind me to jam on the accelerator.
[00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:35.829]  And that's the good part about being in a fast car that has a lot of power.
[00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.033]  I was able to zip ahead and that truck missed me by inches.
[00:18:44.216 --> 00:18:44.556]  Inches.
[00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:48.199]  Inches.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.064]  And that's that's really where I feel like we are because that's my analogy.
[00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:55.285]  We are
[00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:12.364]  60 days to this election, they're doing all the same scams they always do, and then the deep state is all over the place saying there's going to be a civil war if Trump's elected and we're not going to go quietly, and then lying and saying Trump's going to be violent.
[00:19:13.405 --> 00:19:25.436]  I cannot really express to people, and I know almost all of you get this, a lot of you better than I do, but still, even the large group of people that have kind of woken up the last few years, because we are the majority now,
[00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:35.013]  The majority is awake and knows they're being lied to, but they still don't understand how urgent the situation is.
[00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:43.279]  And there's really a normalcy bias that the electricity always turns on and there's always food at the grocery store and you're always going to have a job.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.563]  And that's not where we're going under Kamala Harris.
[00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:51.666]  I mean, the globalists want to vertically integrate the economy.
[00:19:52.725 --> 00:20:03.912]  That's why they shut down every western nation on earth for over a year and a half, third world nations for up to three years, to devastate local economies and independent businesses and infrastructure.
[00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:08.434]  And that's why the average globalist more than doubled their wealth during COVID.
[00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:19.561]  And they have admitted, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, all of them, that that was a test for carbon lockdowns, civil unrest lockdowns, and forcing you into your house to then have
[00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:39.795]  Government propaganda piped into you during another viral release, you name it, and then the government has got all these storehouses of food ready to ship to you to literally train you to be domesticated and sit in your house and watch Netflix and government propaganda while the real infrastructure is being shut down around you.
[00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:42.315]  I mean, this is military assault.
[00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:48.778]  Over a third of the fertilizer under the BlackRock UN-directed ESG
[00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:55.808]  The social credit score for corporations has been stopped.
[00:20:56.769 --> 00:20:58.590]  That alone will massively increase.
[00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.771]  Food prices already has.
[00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:13.280]  They are trying to create inflation, but localized in the general public, while they claim they're trying to fix it and, quote, manage it.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.862]  It's like shooting somebody with a shotgun and then giving them a Band-Aid or an aspirin.
[00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:26.790]  So just the cutting off of energy in the West, the blowing up of the Nord Stream Pipeline cut off a third of Europe's gas, doubled their prices.
[00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:30.392]  I mean, just that act alone is so criminal.
[00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:35.896]  And then they come out and admit, yeah, the West blew it up after telling us that it was the Russians.
[00:21:36.856 --> 00:21:37.637]  It's just wild.
[00:21:37.677 --> 00:21:47.043]  And then again, as I said, thousands of sublines, hundreds of major pipelines like Keystone, that was the newest, biggest, completed and shut down.
[00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:52.062]  I mean, this is serious war going on.
[00:21:52.122 --> 00:21:58.743]  I mean, the low number, 20 million in the actuary insurance companies, the high number, 30 plus million dead from the shots.
[00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:04.884]  I can play you the chief of the British government's, played it last week, operation, he said three years ago.
[00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:11.906]  Yeah, when you take these Pfizer, Moderna shots, it turns off your killer TY blood cells, and we don't know if they ever turn back on.
[00:22:13.117 --> 00:22:18.681]  So we're going to have a lot of business giving you gene therapies to cure the common cold and things because you'll have no immune system.
[00:22:18.721 --> 00:22:20.763]  And he started smiling and giggling.
[00:22:20.843 --> 00:22:35.555]  I mean, when you're watching something of that magnitude, and I see the literature, I see the experts, I have private dinners with top scientists who are getting ready to bring out more on this.
[00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:52.203]  That the COVID vaccine is not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it is a binary weapon, in that it turns off your immune system, so that regular cold viruses and things can make you, and bacteria can get you sick, but also they add a spike protein to any regular virus.
[00:22:52.263 --> 00:22:57.385]  It now gives it total gain of function, and then when your body sees the spike protein, it turns off completely.
[00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:01.427]  So it's not just weakened, it just turns off when it sees it.
[00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:04.808]  That's what the killer Ts do, they're the generals.
[00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:16.818]  That go out and release the antibodies for the rest of the white blood cells, the T lymphocytes to go out and do their job.
[00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:21.479]  So, the globalists know right where to hit us.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.240]  And they are hitting us.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.161]  Yeah, you can show an electron microscope.
[00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:26.661]  This is a...
[00:23:28.257 --> 00:23:56.320]  Computer rendering of it guys go to YouTube or go to X type in white Type in electron microscope or white blood cell hell even regular ones can do it white blood cells are big They're not as big as amoebas, but they're There's some of the bigger cells single cell organisms out there that are in our body both part of our body or outside and you can watch I mean they've had these electron microscope videos for 50 years of White blood cell looks like the blob
[00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:00.043]  And it's on average, you know, 50 times bigger than bacteria.
[00:24:01.144 --> 00:24:07.369]  Or it should be thousands of times bigger than viruses, or dozens of times or hundreds of times the size of bacteria bigger.
[00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:09.550]  And they just come in and gobble them up.
[00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.112]  Yeah, there's a there's a white blood cell.
[00:24:12.733 --> 00:24:13.854]  Looks a lot like an amoeba.
[00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:17.376]  And look, it's just it's not messing with those other cells.
[00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:24.201]  Those other blood cells, it's just going to kill that other bacteria and see like, oh, bye bye, I'm eating you.
[00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:25.863]  Oh, let me eat this.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:35.403]  And it goes around and eats garbage and it eats dead platelets and it just, and then that's why when you get a cut or an infection, pus pours out.
[00:24:36.624 --> 00:24:38.284]  Well, that's what a zit is on your skin.
[00:24:38.304 --> 00:24:40.965]  You got a little infection, a little bacterial invasion, a little viral invasion.
[00:24:41.505 --> 00:24:51.329]  Your body just isolates it, sends in troops, and then the white blood cells gorge and gorge and gorge, and then you get a big pimple and a little white thing comes out.
[00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:55.211]  It's oil and dead, dead, dead troops and dead bacteria and viruses.
[00:24:56.309 --> 00:25:00.411]  So, or neutralized viruses, you can argue whether a virus is alive or not.
[00:25:00.451 --> 00:25:07.654]  And I've got all this news to cover and a lot of things I wanted to cover today, but I mean, at the end of the day, look, it's a fact.
[00:25:08.903 --> 00:25:13.348]  As they roll the shots out, I said three years ago, it was really three and a half, almost four.
[00:25:14.068 --> 00:25:18.413]  I can play you clip after clip of them going, well, there will be a problem with our new vaccine, which isn't a vaccine.
[00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:20.235]  It does turn off your immune system.
[00:25:20.255 --> 00:25:24.920]  But the good thing for big pharma is you'll have to have more gene therapies in the future for everything.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.862]  But then that only makes it worse, too.
[00:25:26.962 --> 00:25:27.843]  I mean, it's like.
[00:25:29.298 --> 00:25:31.459]  Somebody falls overboard on a ship, a cruise ship.
[00:25:31.499 --> 00:25:45.663]  They fall 80 feet down, they hit the water, and instead of one of the crew throwing you a life raft or, you know, one of those little flotation devices, they throw you a bowling ball.
[00:25:47.403 --> 00:25:48.764]  Here, you're having trouble swim?
[00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.044]  Here, here's a bowling ball.
[00:25:51.226 --> 00:25:52.087]  It hits you right in the head.
[00:25:52.107 --> 00:25:53.168]  You don't even need to grab it and sink.
[00:25:53.188 --> 00:25:55.990]  It just conks you on the head and you're knocked out and you go into the waves and die.
[00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.531]  Like, here, here's a bowling ball.
[00:25:58.132 --> 00:26:00.734]  I mean, it's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4 to understand this.
[00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:02.575]  It's, look, look at the number 1.
[00:26:02.655 --> 00:26:03.436]  Like, what's that?
[00:26:04.157 --> 00:26:04.877]  That's the number 1.
[00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:08.520]  It's just, look at that blue sky.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:08.861]  What's that?
[00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.581]  It's a blue sky.
[00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:10.862]  Or, what's that in a tree?
[00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:11.363]  It's a hawk.
[00:26:12.347 --> 00:26:14.929]  Or, you're driving down the street, what's that orange thing or red thing there?
[00:26:14.949 --> 00:26:15.890]  Oh, that's a fire hydrant.
[00:26:16.411 --> 00:26:20.074]  I mean, this doesn't even take computational skills of 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:28.141]  They're cutting off the energy, they're cutting off the fertilizer, they're dissolving the borders, they're handing out extravagant freebies everywhere to totally bankrupt the country.
[00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:29.122]  They admit it's their plan.
[00:26:29.482 --> 00:26:30.162]  Cloward and Piven.
[00:26:31.363 --> 00:26:36.408]  And they've injected people by the third shot of Pfizer or Moderna.
[00:26:36.808 --> 00:26:39.871]  And it's even worse for Moderna because it's stronger, but it has a cumulative effect on the body.
[00:26:42.984 --> 00:26:48.051]  You have no, basically no white blood cell activity.
[00:26:48.411 --> 00:26:54.840]  It isn't like HIV that eats white blood cells, that goes and kills white blood cells.
[00:26:56.202 --> 00:26:57.563]  It turns off
[00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:03.426]  The special type of white blood cell that is the general.
[00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:06.147]  And listeners are like, okay, you talked about this last week.
[00:27:06.528 --> 00:27:10.189]  You know, I feel like I should only talk about this and the 350,000 missing kids.
[00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.771]  Many of them in sex labor, they admit, and slave labor.
[00:27:12.851 --> 00:27:18.494]  I mean, like one of these things alone, like they gave you a shot they knew turns your immune system off.
[00:27:18.974 --> 00:27:20.815]  A vaccine is supposed to turn it up.
[00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:24.096]  It's just crazy.
[00:27:25.817 --> 00:27:27.078]  I don't know, I was just thinking this morning.
[00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.851]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:27:29.871 --> 00:27:31.432]  It's like, why am I just going to cover all this news?
[00:27:31.492 --> 00:27:32.613]  It's just little pieces of it.
[00:27:33.153 --> 00:27:34.815]  When at the end of the day, we already know the answer.
[00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:40.620]  We have a psychotic, mad scientist, criminal government that is organizing and setting the precedent to murder all of us.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.921]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:27:42.221 --> 00:27:42.721]  The year is 2030.
[00:27:42.862 --> 00:27:49.827]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:53.510]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[00:27:53.771 --> 00:27:56.093]  It's bodies from infowarsstore.com.
[00:27:56.533 --> 00:28:01.458]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[00:28:01.698 --> 00:28:03.500]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.663]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the InfoWar.
[00:28:06.763 --> 00:28:10.847]  Visit InfoWarStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:18.053]  All right, as we speak, Trump just started speaking live at the Economic Club of New York.
[00:28:18.354 --> 00:28:19.995]  I want to play a little bit of what he's saying.
[00:28:21.372 --> 00:28:26.734]  And then, I'm going to talk about the future of InfoWars a little bit.
[00:28:26.754 --> 00:28:29.275]  I think now's the time to do it because I'm going to be completely honest with you.
[00:28:30.635 --> 00:28:40.359]  The stuff I've learned the last week, and I keep learning more, about what's going on behind the scenes to shut us down, is really, really serious.
[00:28:40.499 --> 00:28:46.581]  And I almost did not do the show today because I need to be handling this.
[00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:49.242]  Because if I don't spend a lot of time on this,
[00:28:50.981 --> 00:28:54.542]  We're going to be shut down in December, for sure.
[00:28:55.562 --> 00:28:58.762]  And that's pretty newsworthy, and that's a whole giant subject.
[00:29:00.683 --> 00:29:07.724]  And I just hope listeners understand what we've been through in the last 10 weeks.
[00:29:08.304 --> 00:29:18.966]  That means what you've been through, because the fact that the Justice Department is running all this is doing this to us, and the fact that tyranny has been so normalized in America
[00:29:22.532 --> 00:29:27.514]  That I get up here and I talk about this and people didn't believe me, some people, 10 weeks ago.
[00:29:27.554 --> 00:29:30.495]  And then the next week it was in the news exactly what I said.
[00:29:30.515 --> 00:29:33.336]  They go, yeah, we're trying to shut down InfoWars right now.
[00:29:34.277 --> 00:29:35.917]  They went to court and said we want to shut down right now.
[00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:45.721]  The judge said no and set a hearing for two weeks later and then fired the Justice Department official assigned to the case and the CRO who tried to illegally close the doors here.
[00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.759]  And people are like, really, where's the warrant?
[00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:49.440]  Where's the police?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.401]  Where's the news article?
[00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:52.283]  I'm like, they're here trying to close the door.
[00:29:52.463 --> 00:29:53.844]  They're ordering security to kick us out.
[00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:56.606]  I mean, it's vigilantism.
[00:29:58.949 --> 00:30:00.470]  And I printed a bunch of those articles.
[00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.011]  I meant to cover it yesterday, and I didn't.
[00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:03.473]  Will you guys dig into yesterday's stack?
[00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:24.522]  And find all the Sandy Hook articles, NBC, CNN, New York Times, because remember, at first they denied it, that first week, and later went, yeah, no, actually, we did try to shut it down, and we want it shut down right now, and then they went to court and said, you know, we want full control, kick him out of the building, and shacked him off the air, and the judge said no.
[00:30:27.557 --> 00:30:35.720]  The judge did say, because Jones is in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and he owns Infowars, he ordered the sale and liquidation of that.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:50.004]  Well now, the Democratic Party and the Justice Department that control the plaintiffs, has put forward what they want, and I sat there yesterday morning, barely made it on the show, reading the documents, talking to the
[00:30:51.013 --> 00:30:59.418]  New, you know, trustee and people that the judge appointed, who I don't think is a bad guy, but he was telling me and showing me what they want.
[00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:02.140]  And it was just, it's just ridiculous.
[00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:11.566]  And, and so, and I got the actual dates because they moved them around on the 24th of September in just 19 days.
[00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:22.995]  They will announce that the assets, the website, the shopping cart, the equipment, stuff like that, will be put on sale.
[00:31:23.095 --> 00:31:25.877]  And then in a month after that, there'll be a public auction.
[00:31:27.498 --> 00:31:38.266]  And I know there's groups that are patriots and stuff that say they're going to come in and buy it, but the globalists have openly said that, oh, we've got some well-known billionaire that's going to outbid, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:42.048]  And then they'll just sit there and buy it just to close it in front of everybody.
[00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:44.210]  And then you'll take me serious about this.
[00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:52.349]  Because, I mean, I'm literally watched like being marched up to the gallows pole here from my jail cell, and there's the executioner right there.
[00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:58.271]  And I'm telling people, and you saw us survive all these years, you're like, oh yeah, you know, they'll survive.
[00:31:58.311 --> 00:32:00.732]  Come on, you know, get up there, Alex.
[00:32:00.772 --> 00:32:01.332]  It's all fine.
[00:32:01.632 --> 00:32:04.073]  And I don't even know what to say or do at this point.
[00:32:06.313 --> 00:32:07.054]  They didn't want to settle.
[00:32:07.074 --> 00:32:07.834]  They didn't want money.
[00:32:07.874 --> 00:32:08.214]  They didn't know.
[00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:12.056]  They said, we want you shut down, and we want to silence you.
[00:32:12.136 --> 00:32:13.096]  And then it gets worse.
[00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:23.833]  They're filing and saying that they own my name and they own me and that any social media I ever have is theirs.
[00:32:24.653 --> 00:32:28.114]  And they say real Alex Jones that I set up personally 16 years ago is theirs.
[00:32:28.934 --> 00:32:31.175]  And they say the archive of all the shows will be theirs.
[00:32:31.555 --> 00:32:35.216]  And they're gonna go out and ban it everywhere and have bots say no one can ever post me.
[00:32:35.676 --> 00:32:37.136]  You can't own somebody's identity.
[00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:38.896]  You can't own what a talk show host did.
[00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:41.197]  I'm not like Prince that signed a
[00:32:42.603 --> 00:32:44.426]  360.
[00:32:42.643 --> 00:32:44.426]  That's what they're called.
[00:32:45.248 --> 00:32:47.331]  Contract with a big record company from memory.
[00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:48.653]  I think it was Sony, but I forget.
[00:32:48.673 --> 00:32:49.615]  I remember he had to be the...
[00:32:51.437 --> 00:32:52.717]  Artist formerly known as Prince.
[00:32:53.217 --> 00:32:55.138]  I never signed a 360 contract with anybody.
[00:32:55.238 --> 00:33:01.459]  I've said with public documents and statements in a file this thick for 25 years, you can copy my films.
[00:33:01.499 --> 00:33:02.680]  The show's owned by the public.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.200]  It's not copyrighted.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.080]  It's yours.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.261]  You can edit it, change it.
[00:33:06.841 --> 00:33:11.462]  Because I wanted people to be able to put it on AXS TV or buy time on local TV and put it on.
[00:33:11.662 --> 00:33:15.423]  And I had contracts that are still there on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:17.486 --> 00:33:19.949]  They're saying that this belongs to the public.
[00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:25.556]  So no one, you can get a website, you can get the shopping cart, that's it.
[00:33:26.697 --> 00:33:34.826]  But they're literally saying, no, we're saying, and they're going to have a hearing on the 24th with a judge in Houston, I'll be there.
[00:33:36.038 --> 00:33:36.998]  Boy, how am I going to be there?
[00:33:37.018 --> 00:33:39.460]  That's the day after I speak with Tucker Carlson in Pennsylvania.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.081]  I guess I've got to fly to Pennsylvania that night.
[00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:44.882]  Because all these planets align the wrong way.
[00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:49.824]  And just get up and say, you cannot own my name.
[00:33:49.884 --> 00:33:51.125]  You do not own Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:53.066]  They're saying they own the name Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:53.206 --> 00:33:54.707]  That's just my name.
[00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:58.962]  Was it what's gonna be called Alex Jones Live, whatever?
[00:33:58.982 --> 00:34:03.225]  I mean, it's the un-American arrogance of these people.
[00:34:03.926 --> 00:34:24.242]  And you remember, you can type the headline in if you're a new viewer, Sandy Hook parents, no, it's not the parents, it's the Justice Department, the CIA that's come out in the news, asked court to give them Alex Jones' social media, type it in, Sandy Hook families asked bankruptcy court to give them Alex Jones' Twitter accounts.
[00:34:25.387 --> 00:34:26.047]  Put it in the search engine.
[00:34:26.067 --> 00:34:26.888]  I'll do it right now myself.
[00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:31.050]  So, so everybody saw that one.
[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.670]  That's crazy.
[00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.872]  The judge wouldn't even, wouldn't even entertain it.
[00:34:34.892 --> 00:34:36.953]  He wouldn't even take it up because it's ridiculous.
[00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:40.595]  I mean, you know, Tucker Carlson gets fired from Fox.
[00:34:40.755 --> 00:34:43.796]  They don't get his Tucker Carlson ex account.
[00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:44.517]  I'll do it myself.
[00:34:45.557 --> 00:34:46.378]  Go to rebroadcast.
[00:34:46.538 --> 00:34:47.278]  I just look.
[00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:48.399]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:34:49.198 --> 00:34:49.898]  I'm sorry I'm mad.
[00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:50.759]  I just could barely do the show.
[00:34:50.819 --> 00:34:53.280]  Sandy Hook families want to seize Alex Jones social media accounts.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.140]  That's Reuters.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.701]  All right, great job guys.
[00:34:56.562 --> 00:34:59.923]  So, um, yeah, print me all that.
[00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:02.665]  So, I mean, you understand I'm up here telling you this.
[00:35:02.785 --> 00:35:04.926]  You understand the precedence this sets?
[00:35:05.786 --> 00:35:11.629]  Now, obviously, Elon Musk understands and he said in his contract and this original Twitter contract, someone can't
[00:35:14.855 --> 00:35:16.196]  Sell their personal account.
[00:35:16.436 --> 00:35:17.076]  It's not allowed.
[00:35:17.736 --> 00:35:32.983]  If Mick Jagger, I don't even know if he has an ex-account, if The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, wanted to sell his ex-account and have somebody else be him, he can't do that.
[00:35:33.643 --> 00:35:35.544]  It's a personal account.
[00:35:36.618 --> 00:35:45.684]  But see, they want to steal my identity and then sit there to my fans and supporters and then say whatever crap they want to, because they're all about stealing your birthright.
[00:35:46.224 --> 00:35:52.688]  This is the globalists in general, stealing your children, stealing your freedom, stealing your speech, stealing your right to self-defense.
[00:35:53.929 --> 00:35:58.994]  Stealing your access to energy, to food, to healthcare, your right to refuse poison shots.
[00:35:59.114 --> 00:36:01.076]  They are... The globalists are rapists.
[00:36:01.516 --> 00:36:02.958]  Bill Gates is a rapist.
[00:36:03.578 --> 00:36:07.902]  They want to fully control your body, control your mind, control every facet of your life.
[00:36:07.942 --> 00:36:12.406]  So... I get up here for 3-4 hours a day.
[00:36:12.426 --> 00:36:13.247]  I do all this other work.
[00:36:13.267 --> 00:36:13.928]  I'm not complaining.
[00:36:14.388 --> 00:36:16.110]  And I get exhausted by 5 o'clock.
[00:36:17.304 --> 00:36:32.358]  And I'm in this paradox where I need to be fighting this and taking full charge, like I did when I stopped him, and like I did when I said, no, we're doing what I want, we're going to the court and saying this, and it was the truth, and we were successful.
[00:36:32.918 --> 00:36:43.568]  So the issue is, I have to make all the decisions, I have to navigate all this, and we're literally, potentially, it could be as quick as two months from now, shutting this down.
[00:36:46.056 --> 00:36:47.037]  And people just again.
[00:36:48.417 --> 00:36:55.260]  I've had so many great family members like my dad's uncle, who is just a wonderful person, Leonard Jones, and he had pancreatic cancer.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:04.605]  He lived longer than most people, two years, and he was over at my house when got Mexican food is like eight years ago, nine years ago when referee died and.
[00:37:06.586 --> 00:37:09.127]  I went and got him fajitas and we had a glass of wine.
[00:37:09.147 --> 00:37:13.729]  He was still look great and handsome, great guy, really smart and.
[00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:21.450]  Hugged him, he left to go see one of his older daughters that lives in Austin, stay at her house, who's living in Houston.
[00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:27.495]  And like two weeks later, he was dead.
[00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:37.302]  Mainly because they aimed the radiation beam to supposedly kill the cancer wrong and shot a hole through some of his other organs.
[00:37:38.023 --> 00:37:38.844]  That wasn't very fun.
[00:37:39.684 --> 00:37:44.128]  But the point was, you just expect somebody to be there.
[00:37:44.912 --> 00:37:45.392]  And then they're not.
[00:37:47.074 --> 00:37:53.058]  So, people really shouldn't take InfoWars for granted, and I want to just be very clear.
[00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:59.923]  They've been trying to get us off the air for seven years with these lawsuits and lawfare and debanking and attacks.
[00:37:59.943 --> 00:38:02.165]  I mean, it was going on before that, but it ramped way up.
[00:38:03.746 --> 00:38:09.550]  And they've admitted on MSNBC and the New York Times and CNN that if they can shut me down and develop the formula, they're going to do it to everybody.
[00:38:12.537 --> 00:38:16.038]  And I've already been accused of being a Russian agent, which of course isn't true with no evidence.
[00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:18.919]  And they just continue on down this line.
[00:38:18.939 --> 00:38:21.259]  So before I hit the news, there's a lot of it here.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:36.383]  I just want all of you to know that if you guys can just get yesterday's stack or go into the archive of what you printed that I sent you or into my text messages from two days ago,
[00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:57.832]  And uh print me all the other stuff about that because I want to show people I don't want to just I want to show them saying yeah we want him closed right now yeah we tried to lock the building up yeah we yeah we did it after they lied and said they didn't it's just it's just they just do whatever they want and I don't want to just tell you this stuff I want you to see it okay because this is all admitted and
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:06.886]  So now they don't want to just take me off X, the only social media I'm allowed on other than Rumble, and Gab, and a few others.
[00:39:07.767 --> 00:39:11.910]  We have our own system, InfoWars, and Banned.Video, but not for long the other way.
[00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:17.254]  They want to have my identity.
[00:39:17.274 --> 00:39:20.557]  They literally filed with the court, Alex Jones, we own that.
[00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:26.762]  Not just the X account, real Alex Jones, they say we own Alex Jones.
[00:39:27.062 --> 00:39:27.643]  No, you don't!
[00:39:30.776 --> 00:39:31.677]  But that's what they did.
[00:39:31.737 --> 00:39:34.800]  They hired PR firms when Trump won to look at my history.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:43.087]  They found 22 minutes of me over years with callers calling in, not believing Sandy Hook happened, and me agreeing with them a few times to so much stuff's bull.
[00:39:43.407 --> 00:39:46.089]  And they said, oh, he got successful off them.
[00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:47.411]  He made hundreds of millions off them.
[00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:48.211]  Never did that.
[00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:49.132]  Totally made up.
[00:39:50.473 --> 00:39:55.137]  And he's sending people to pee on their graves and attack their houses.
[00:39:55.197 --> 00:39:55.958]  No evidence of that.
[00:39:56.038 --> 00:39:56.779]  No one even did that.
[00:39:57.967 --> 00:40:11.558]  And then, they run PR firm stuff for several years, and I won't stop attacking these people to attach themselves to me, to do fundraisers off of me, and then have judges find me guilty and have rigged trials on the damages.
[00:40:11.718 --> 00:40:14.720]  He's guilty, we're just gonna decide how much, and he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.462]  Personally, he's worth $360 million.
[00:40:16.802 --> 00:40:18.283]  Oh, he's worth $400 million.
[00:40:19.744 --> 00:40:21.386]  At that time they were saying that,
[00:40:22.441 --> 00:40:32.850]  I had $3 million in the bank from selling my house, and I had over $3 million in bills, and I paid my bills a couple weeks after the fake Texas case, then I had the Connecticut case, and I was negative.
[00:40:33.891 --> 00:40:36.053]  And I tried to tell the judge that, and she said, shut up!
[00:40:36.614 --> 00:40:39.917]  Your facts are your facts, and they're not true, and you're gonna learn that here.
[00:40:40.257 --> 00:40:42.699]  You are not upside down.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.344]  You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and you got it from them.
[00:40:49.588 --> 00:40:52.372]  The Sandy Hook mother gets up and says, he attacked me today.
[00:40:53.152 --> 00:40:54.334]  He went on air today.
[00:40:55.135 --> 00:40:56.717]  He said my son didn't exist.
[00:40:56.817 --> 00:40:57.338]  I don't exist.
[00:40:57.358 --> 00:40:58.919]  And I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:40:59.901 --> 00:41:00.822]  I said the opposite.
[00:41:00.882 --> 00:41:01.743]  I taped it that morning.
[00:41:01.803 --> 00:41:02.804]  I didn't matter.
[00:41:02.844 --> 00:41:03.785]  The jury just looks at me.
[00:41:04.346 --> 00:41:06.509]  Literal upside down world.
[00:41:08.652 --> 00:41:11.513]  And you're sitting there looking at these people and you're like, what is this thing?
[00:41:12.314 --> 00:41:22.159]  And it comes out the FBI created the whole operation, the CIA is involved, they admit it, they get on the stand, I have the US government, corrupt, hijacked government attacking me?
[00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:28.522]  So...
[00:41:29.935 --> 00:41:32.597]  I'm not spending a lot of time talking about our position and where we're at.
[00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:39.222]  And I want to do a special report or something that's like 10 minutes long that shows it all in successive order just to get it on record.
[00:41:40.703 --> 00:41:42.184]  But I mean, I'll just say this right now.
[00:41:44.966 --> 00:41:46.848]  They wanted me off the air before the election.
[00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:50.371]  I said it when they were trying to close us down without a court order.
[00:41:51.151 --> 00:41:56.115]  Just because they were the Justice Department and they had a trustee appointed by the judge that they recommended.
[00:41:56.135 --> 00:41:58.477]  The person outside of the judge tried that.
[00:42:01.482 --> 00:42:07.123]  And now what they've discovered that we got back in control with top accounting firms is unbelievable.
[00:42:07.163 --> 00:42:09.984]  That's going to be disclosed soon of what was going on with the CRO, Pat McGill.
[00:42:11.344 --> 00:42:16.485]  And the thing is, I've just got to get all this digested, get it all in order, and then just put it all out there.
[00:42:16.525 --> 00:42:17.725]  And it's devastating.
[00:42:18.126 --> 00:42:19.566]  And I've got recordings of them.
[00:42:19.646 --> 00:42:20.406]  I've got everything.
[00:42:20.446 --> 00:42:29.088]  And the thing is, I'm so busy trying to keep from stopping killing Trump and launching World War III, trying to expose the criminal gangs running wild across the country, that I'm not spending, really,
[00:42:30.356 --> 00:42:36.459]  More than maybe 5% of my time on this, and I spent a lot of time yesterday morning, and I'm like, holy hell!
[00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:39.600]  This is even worse than I thought!
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:47.483]  So... Uh... Here's the deal.
[00:42:49.044 --> 00:42:50.565]  We have a good crew, a great crew.
[00:42:50.605 --> 00:42:51.885]  We have a good infrastructure here.
[00:42:54.967 --> 00:42:58.068]  And I'll be able to get back on the air very, very quickly, regardless of what they do.
[00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:05.657]  But it just shows that these people are lawless.
[00:43:05.677 --> 00:43:07.638]  I'm talking about the deep state that runs all this.
[00:43:08.838 --> 00:43:10.379]  And that they'll do anything.
[00:43:11.659 --> 00:43:12.840]  It's total vigilantism.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.821]  Because they feel like they're above the law, they feel like they're invincible.
[00:43:16.181 --> 00:43:29.967]  And that's what's happening with the Justice Department and these agencies is it's like you go out of town for a month to Europe and let's say you've got a 16-year-old son who you left behind and you took your daughters with you.
[00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:30.647]  This is hypothetical.
[00:43:32.355 --> 00:43:33.155]  And you come home.
[00:43:33.175 --> 00:43:34.676]  This never happened to me, but I've heard these stories.
[00:43:35.396 --> 00:43:38.397]  And your son with some of his buddies have been partying in the house for a month.
[00:43:39.057 --> 00:43:42.798]  And your son's gang member buddies, they're a couple years older, say, hey, this is our house now.
[00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:45.339]  And they know the squatting rules.
[00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:46.659]  That's actually happened sometimes.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.281]  And you try to kick them out of your house and they pull a gun on you or something.
[00:43:50.901 --> 00:43:53.622]  That's what the federal government is.
[00:43:54.022 --> 00:43:54.822]  They're hijackers.
[00:43:56.445 --> 00:43:56.806]  We're good to go.
[00:44:13.328 --> 00:44:19.290]  And she's getting in the truck or the car and she's leaving and he gets pissed and runs out and starts shooting at the car.
[00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.831]  I mean, we're to that point.
[00:44:21.891 --> 00:44:29.353]  We just want away from you and your pedophilia and your corruption and your hatred of America because they have to hate America.
[00:44:29.613 --> 00:44:42.157]  The globalists had to get people that were scum and psychotics and trash and corrupt and pedophiles and weak people to be their soldiers because you've got to be scum to do the things they do.
[00:44:43.661 --> 00:44:46.723]  Evil is very prominent at the top and at the management levels.
[00:44:46.803 --> 00:44:47.903]  It's not in the general public.
[00:44:48.383 --> 00:44:58.609]  The general public is confused, lazy sometimes, distracted, don't have big opinions of themselves, don't have confidence, are just busy trying to make ends meet.
[00:44:58.689 --> 00:44:59.089]  I get it.
[00:44:59.709 --> 00:45:01.890]  But let me explain something.
[00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:05.492]  You think you know how corrupt this government, these corporations are?
[00:45:05.572 --> 00:45:10.415]  You don't have any idea unless you've been really in the trenches with these people like I have for 30 years.
[00:45:11.095 --> 00:45:12.516]  And they're getting worse by the minute.
[00:45:14.227 --> 00:45:30.344]  And they have this invigoration of arrogance and chutzpah and bravado and hubris that they just think that they got the feds on their side, they got BlackRock on their side, they got the mainstream media, and they got Hollywood, and they're gonna beat us.
[00:45:30.925 --> 00:45:31.526]  But you're not.
[00:45:33.032 --> 00:45:44.155]  And again, they think if they can wreck society and get rid of a middle class, that'll make us dependent, like they did with black folks, with the Great Society, with LBJ, and that finally they'll win.
[00:45:44.255 --> 00:45:46.996]  But that only works if people don't know they did it.
[00:45:51.657 --> 00:45:55.178]  So, this is a very explosive situation.
[00:45:55.298 --> 00:45:56.298]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up.
[00:45:57.539 --> 00:45:58.659]  People really loved it yesterday.
[00:45:59.986 --> 00:46:09.814]  And it was really informative, and we only did it for about 50 minutes, so I ran out of time, and I had a lot of other questions, and listeners sent me over 30 questions, some of which I asked, but 25 of these have not been asked.
[00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:13.197]  They're really good questions, and I'm sure the crew will come up with other great questions.
[00:46:13.217 --> 00:46:18.782]  The crew had the best questions with ChatGPT of OpenAI, supposedly the best AI out there, and it said the U.S.
[00:46:18.822 --> 00:46:20.143]  government does staged terror attacks.
[00:46:20.463 --> 00:46:20.703]  The U.S.
[00:46:20.723 --> 00:46:23.366]  government does tax plans for staging mass shootings.
[00:46:24.066 --> 00:46:25.728]  That was ChatGPT, not me.
[00:46:26.781 --> 00:46:32.366]  And it did say that fluoride does lower your IQ as a deadly poison, and the federal government secretly knows it's true, and has now admitted it.
[00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:33.828]  And it was just incredible.
[00:46:34.629 --> 00:46:37.832]  So, uh, tomorrow we'll have open phones again.
[00:46:39.193 --> 00:46:43.857]  And maybe do a Spaces at the same time and take, you know, audio feed calls that way.
[00:46:43.877 --> 00:46:46.279]  It's not really a call, but it's digital HD audio.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:47.981]  And we'll do that.
[00:46:49.122 --> 00:46:50.423]  But we'll do chat GPT.
[00:46:52.138 --> 00:47:02.649]  In the next hour and then in the third hour I want to look at the globalist and their destabilization operations, the type of false flags that a lot of experts are looking at and what I believe they're getting ready to hatch.
[00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:12.315]  I did say last week that within a few days before the debate, which is just four days away, that they would stage a mass shooting or let one happen.
[00:47:13.016 --> 00:47:19.020]  And I said that I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI was basically tracking this guy, this Colt Gray 14.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.842]  A year and a half ago and again a year ago, they were giving specific tips.
[00:47:22.862 --> 00:47:24.163]  He was planning to be a mass shooter.
[00:47:25.624 --> 00:47:26.745]  And this happens in almost every case.
[00:47:26.765 --> 00:47:28.006]  But of course, just same thing with
[00:47:29.406 --> 00:47:31.347]  Adam Lanza, who killed the kids in San Diego.
[00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:32.188]  I didn't do it.
[00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:33.289]  I know people actually believe that.
[00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:34.089]  I didn't kill the kids.
[00:47:34.169 --> 00:47:36.011]  I've never been to Connecticut until they sued me.
[00:47:36.331 --> 00:47:36.791]  I didn't do it.
[00:47:37.712 --> 00:47:43.496]  But... And as usual, they knew what was going on and did nothing.
[00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:45.397]  Just like the stand down in Butler.
[00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.611]  So we're going to be getting to that.
[00:47:47.811 --> 00:48:01.288]  Also, as I told you months ago, because I see the local news and also talk to police, these Venezuelan gangs and MS-13 out of El Salvador was actually founded in Los Angeles, but sent back to El Salvador and then back here by the CIA.
[00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:02.510]  That's admitted by Clinton.
[00:48:04.441 --> 00:48:08.944]  Uh, they are operating in Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio.
[00:48:08.984 --> 00:48:09.805]  Now that's in the news.
[00:48:10.665 --> 00:48:18.791]  Uh, they're operating, uh, all over Illinois, all over California, all over Oregon, all over Washington state, all over New York, all over Florida.
[00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:21.232]  Uh, and just everywhere, basically in between.
[00:48:21.252 --> 00:48:28.277]  I got a stack of news on that and just police on video saying we don't even prosecute them for attempted murder or murder suspects.
[00:48:28.597 --> 00:48:29.158]  They said, nope.
[00:48:29.738 --> 00:48:32.140]  If you are an illegal alien, we're a sanctuary city.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.201]  We're ordered to not even track you for murder.
[00:48:36.743 --> 00:48:39.344]  And the cop says it with pleasure in Colorado and Denver.
[00:48:40.245 --> 00:48:40.925]  And we've got this.
[00:48:41.005 --> 00:48:46.609]  A Dallas police confirmed Venezuela gang that took over Aurora, Colorado apartment complex is now wreaking havoc in Texas.
[00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:52.253]  Previously deported in Salvadorian arrested after police find children chained to a bed in this DC area.
[00:48:52.653 --> 00:48:54.094]  Wonder who the kids were servicing.
[00:48:56.363 --> 00:48:59.785]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, I've got, like, 50 of these or something in my stack.
[00:48:59.825 --> 00:49:04.769]  I mean, it's just, I was like, so many today, I can't even, like, it's giving me a headache trying to even keep track of it.
[00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.631]  So yeah, here's the armed gangs taking over.
[00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:14.535]  When you have the governors, though, in places like Colorado saying, nothing's happening, it's a fantasy, he said last week.
[00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:16.537]  Yeah, it's a fantasy.
[00:49:18.138 --> 00:49:25.163]  The piles of garbage, the kids chained to beds, the murder, the drug dealing, the people being thrown out of their houses, they're not taking over houses.
[00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:33.175]  And they said a year ago, we are coming to your stinking country, you weak, dumb Americans, and we're going to take your houses and apartments, and we are backed by your Democrats.
[00:49:33.215 --> 00:49:34.036]  We love Biden!
[00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:36.258]  Aha, you're weak, you stupid pigs!
[00:49:36.839 --> 00:49:37.479]  I mean, literally.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:46.087]  It's like a cartoon, like a villain's like, you dumb, stinking crap heads, we screw your wives, ha ha, you'll get your love, oh you!
[00:49:46.347 --> 00:49:47.328]  I mean, it's like, what?
[00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:49.270]  That's what evil people act like!
[00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:54.578]  And like Trump said, he goes, man, our crime and our gangs aren't anything close to these people.
[00:49:54.598 --> 00:49:57.141]  Yeah, because Venezuela is a hellhole.
[00:49:57.581 --> 00:49:59.123]  El Salvador was a hellhole.
[00:49:59.423 --> 00:50:02.125]  I mean, we're talking hellholes, hellholes.
[00:50:03.226 --> 00:50:07.290]  And man, they're taking the very worst criminals and mentally ill and psychotics.
[00:50:08.892 --> 00:50:10.553]  And they are just spewing them out at us.
[00:50:10.613 --> 00:50:11.614]  So I'm going to say this.
[00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:13.016]  I'm going to be very, very straight about it.
[00:50:15.964 --> 00:50:20.046]  You need to support our sponsors that lavishly support whatever new thing we need to set up.
[00:50:20.826 --> 00:50:22.707]  I'm not just going to fight them shutting down InfoWars.
[00:50:22.727 --> 00:50:29.169]  I'm going to start working with groups that want me to work with them, where I can work for folks and they won't be able to shut it down as long as I'm not the owner.
[00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.831]  And I'm going to go ahead and pull the trigger on creating something entirely new.
[00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:36.852]  And then if this place continues on, we'll just work with a new thing.
[00:50:37.152 --> 00:50:37.993]  So I got that to do.
[00:50:39.284 --> 00:50:40.045]  We're good to go.
[00:51:01.883 --> 00:51:03.063]  I need you to get the damn products.
[00:51:03.443 --> 00:51:04.224]  I mean, they're amazing.
[00:51:04.244 --> 00:51:11.905]  The NanoSilver products, thanks to all the financial energy, the KabaChill, the Top Brain, which is a stimulant combo, more than a dozen ingredients.
[00:51:12.345 --> 00:51:13.125]  It's all amazing.
[00:51:14.546 --> 00:51:18.787]  There is obviously the Whole Food Multivitamins, the highest quality organic multivitamin.
[00:51:18.927 --> 00:51:22.047]  There is so many other amazing products.
[00:51:22.087 --> 00:51:28.809]  The Fibergreens, the concentrates of all these different key sprouts that flush out your guts and boost your immune system and make you so healthy.
[00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:31.913]  Fibergreens are the highest quality.
[00:51:33.315 --> 00:51:39.543]  We have the Rocket Rest that is an incredible natural sleep aid that's so important for your whole body and immune system.
[00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:40.945]  It always goes back to that.
[00:51:41.005 --> 00:51:43.528]  It's all at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:51:45.606 --> 00:51:48.447]  You've got the Immune Gargle with Nanosilver Swish and Swash.
[00:51:48.788 --> 00:51:49.768]  Buy one, get one free.
[00:51:49.808 --> 00:51:50.569]  That's selling out.
[00:51:51.489 --> 00:51:54.231]  There's the, a lot of it's sold out, like Primal Youth.
[00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:54.951]  They got to reorder that.
[00:51:54.991 --> 00:51:55.831]  That is amazing.
[00:51:56.492 --> 00:51:57.692]  That's that HGH Booster.
[00:51:58.553 --> 00:51:59.994]  There's the Knockout Sleep Aid.
[00:52:00.014 --> 00:52:00.614]  People love that.
[00:52:00.674 --> 00:52:01.654]  It's different formulas for folks.
[00:52:01.674 --> 00:52:02.375]  PMS Guard.
[00:52:03.655 --> 00:52:06.277]  There is so many amazing products.
[00:52:07.337 --> 00:52:08.518]  There's Longevity Blend.
[00:52:09.258 --> 00:52:13.781]  There's, for your telomeres and everything else, Nanosilver.
[00:52:15.506 --> 00:52:16.207]  Colloidal silver.
[00:52:16.247 --> 00:52:16.828]  It's all there.
[00:52:16.848 --> 00:52:18.170]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.871]  You want to keep us on air?
[00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:19.672]  You want to keep fighting?
[00:52:19.752 --> 00:52:20.193]  I need your help.
[00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:20.894]  I can't do it without you.
[00:52:21.174 --> 00:52:22.216]  I'm asking for your help right now.
[00:52:22.336 --> 00:52:23.298]  Go to DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:52:23.732 --> 00:52:29.494]  COVID vax causes more heart damage than COVID virus and brain, blood, immune cancer, reproductive study.
[00:52:29.814 --> 00:52:30.735]  I mean, there's so many studies.
[00:52:30.755 --> 00:52:31.295]  What do you make of that?
[00:52:31.355 --> 00:52:33.436]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[00:52:33.736 --> 00:52:39.538]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[00:52:39.919 --> 00:52:41.399]  It's a government false narrative.
[00:52:41.459 --> 00:52:47.322]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[00:52:47.522 --> 00:52:48.202]  It doesn't.
[00:52:48.402 --> 00:52:50.423]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[00:52:50.443 --> 00:52:51.783]  When you follow the article, there's no link.
[00:52:51.823 --> 00:52:52.344]  There's no proof.
[00:52:52.384 --> 00:52:52.824]  It just says,
[00:52:53.524 --> 00:52:58.005]  COVID's a greater risk of heart problems than the shot and they just lie.
[00:52:58.385 --> 00:53:06.208]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC, the NIH.
[00:53:07.048 --> 00:53:08.828]  This is a false narrative.
[00:53:09.188 --> 00:53:12.669]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[00:53:12.709 --> 00:53:13.830]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:17.891]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist Alex, I am knee-deep
[00:53:18.371 --> 00:53:28.438]  In people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure, the vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and insomnias, inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[00:53:28.898 --> 00:53:31.420]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart, another study.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:37.364]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[00:53:37.424 --> 00:53:40.906]  It's very important for people to realize they may not feel chest pain initially,
[00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:47.913]  But then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[00:53:47.973 --> 00:53:50.897]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[00:53:51.217 --> 00:53:53.479]  It's vaccine myocarditis and heart failure.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.101]  They need treatment for this.
[00:53:55.421 --> 00:54:03.230]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements, available through onlinehealthnow.com.
[00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:13.857]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:23.103]  Now, I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, bad as taking the shots,
[00:54:24.059 --> 00:54:40.758]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published, you have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:44.282]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[00:54:44.582 --> 00:54:48.824]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[00:54:48.984 --> 00:54:56.907]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:58.668]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[00:54:58.968 --> 00:55:02.470]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:08.232]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this, very good support for doing this.
[00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:09.833]  It's natokinase,
[00:55:10.313 --> 00:55:13.475]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[00:55:13.515 --> 00:55:14.595]  Japanese discovered it.
[00:55:15.175 --> 00:55:18.797]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[00:55:19.237 --> 00:55:22.799]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.540]  These are all in capsule format.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.301]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[00:55:27.641 --> 00:55:29.522]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[00:55:29.622 --> 00:55:32.564]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[00:55:32.904 --> 00:55:33.625]  So you build up?
[00:55:33.965 --> 00:55:34.665]  And we build up.
[00:55:34.725 --> 00:55:38.648]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.830]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:46.554]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners, and we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[00:55:46.814 --> 00:55:50.517]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[00:55:50.737 --> 00:55:51.738]  They don't dissolve them.
[00:55:51.978 --> 00:55:57.943]  We actually have to give thrombolytic enzymes, that's McCulloch protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[00:55:58.323 --> 00:56:02.186]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:02.506 --> 00:56:03.567]  That's the go-to place.
[00:56:03.587 --> 00:56:08.912]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[00:56:08.952 --> 00:56:12.534]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase, but five minor ingredients.
[00:56:12.755 --> 00:56:20.020]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
[00:56:20.401 --> 00:56:21.922]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.836]  Hour number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:25.856 --> 00:56:28.217]  I'm going to intersperse key breaking news and analysis.
[00:56:30.318 --> 00:56:34.960]  But I said I would get to some of Trump's speech on the economy that's now still going, but we have it back at the start.
[00:56:35.967 --> 00:56:42.613]  And I'm going to play some of Trump's speech right now, and then I'm going to come back, hit news, and then I'm going to interview Chad GPT again today.
[00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:47.497]  I won't do this for a while after this, but I didn't get all my questions in unless you're sending a bunch of other questions that are excellent.
[00:56:47.938 --> 00:56:48.478]  That's coming up.
[00:56:48.518 --> 00:56:55.004]  But here is some of President Trump speaking right now to the Business Association of New York about the economy.
[00:57:02.674 --> 00:57:06.875]  Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, terrific person.
[00:57:08.035 --> 00:57:09.976]  Former Secretary Wilbur Ross.
[00:57:11.336 --> 00:57:14.697]  Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
[00:57:16.977 --> 00:57:21.938]  Former SEC Chairman Jay- Stop right there.
[00:57:22.078 --> 00:57:23.859]  I know I give a lot of orders, folks.
[00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:27.799]  I wanted to pass the five minutes of thank you-ing, so just forget it.
[00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:28.320]  Just forget it.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:29.600]  Look,
[00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:43.727]  Since I mentioned earlier how they're trying to file with the court if they're able to buy it, the CIA and FBI, to shut it down, to attack American free speech, to wreck, you know, activity.
[00:57:45.108 --> 00:57:47.009]  But they want my name, Alex Jones.
[00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:48.150]  That's what they're saying now.
[00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.151]  They own my name.
[00:57:49.831 --> 00:57:50.232]  Yeah, right.
[00:57:51.332 --> 00:57:53.514]  I didn't sign any 360 contract with you jackasses.
[00:57:54.335 --> 00:57:55.335]  And I will beat you at this.
[00:57:56.636 --> 00:58:02.020]  But also that they tried to take it in court six weeks ago.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:02.661]  Here's the clip.
[00:58:04.215 --> 00:58:09.239]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have massive breaking 2024 election news.
[00:58:09.799 --> 00:58:11.000]  This is breaking right now.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:22.829]  The Democratic Party has now filed in federal court a lawsuit to take over any conservative person's website they want, including Tucker Carlson, President Trump, Elon Musk.
[00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:28.052]  They have filed in federal court to take over real Alex Jones on X.
[00:58:30.285 --> 00:58:32.711]  Total election meddling, total desperation.
[00:58:33.113 --> 00:58:38.687]  Under law, and I've talked to top internet copyright lawyers, someone's private real Alex Jones on action.
[00:58:39.634 --> 00:58:44.376]  It's like my ability to mail a letter or my ability to go to a grocery store, my ability to pay for electricity.
[00:58:44.816 --> 00:58:45.957]  This is a social credit score.
[00:58:46.357 --> 00:58:57.162]  They have filed, we'll show you the headlines, to take my ex account when they take over InfoWars and take any future public operation I have stealing my voice.
[00:58:57.482 --> 00:59:00.963]  It's like saying we want to cut out Alex Jones's vocal cords.
[00:59:01.344 --> 00:59:04.025]  They want the judge to rule they're going to cut out my vocal cords.
[00:59:04.545 --> 00:59:06.647]  This shows how insanely desperate they are.
[00:59:06.727 --> 00:59:10.730]  The Democratic Party, Senator Blumenthal, they run this whole operation.
[00:59:11.091 --> 00:59:12.832]  This is unbelievable.
[00:59:12.932 --> 00:59:19.678]  And just today, I interviewed Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand in two powerful viral videos about freedom.
[00:59:20.178 --> 00:59:21.860]  They're in full panic mode, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.701]  They don't know what to do.
[00:59:22.981 --> 00:59:25.703]  They already tried to de-platform me and silence me six years ago.
[00:59:26.003 --> 00:59:28.446]  We fought back together, so now they don't know what to do.
[00:59:28.786 --> 00:59:30.587]  And now they have filed in court
[00:59:31.408 --> 00:59:39.532]  To take away, not just my personal ex-account, but all of our crew's personal ex-accounts and say, you don't have free speech.
[00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.413]  Elon Musk, this is the bad signal.
[00:59:41.433 --> 00:59:42.014]  You're not stupid.
[00:59:42.214 --> 00:59:43.154]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.515 --> 00:59:47.257]  This is an attack on Elon Musk and ex and President Trump and everybody's free speech.
[00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:56.662]  If they're able to get away with this, they can take everybody's accounts they want and they can completely silence them because in the new world, the new system,
[00:59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.345]  Okay, you take him four hours away, you fire my crew, whatever, I can still do a show every day.
[01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:06.430]  But they think, and this finally, my current ex-account with millions of followers and any new one they own.
[01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:08.432]  This is a dark day.
[01:00:08.452 --> 01:00:11.234]  This is an information coup over America.
[01:00:11.314 --> 01:00:12.435]  Follow me at RealAlexJones.
[01:00:13.116 --> 01:00:14.997]  I believe Elon Musk will stand up against this.
[01:00:15.498 --> 01:00:24.446]  Regardless what you think about me or Elon Musk or Donald Trump or anybody, we have a right to have our own personal accounts no matter what, and they don't have a right to steal those from us.
[01:00:24.986 --> 01:00:26.167]  This is a dark day for America.
[01:00:26.387 --> 01:00:27.868]  They're so close to shutting down InfoWars.
[01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:30.149]  They're so close to shutting down InfoWars.com.
[01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:34.912]  They already tried weeks ago to shut us down, but we stood up against it.
[01:00:34.952 --> 01:00:35.552]  They backed off.
[01:00:35.972 --> 01:00:38.114]  There's a big federal hearing tomorrow about all this.
[01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.214]  This has been filed in.
[01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:41.055]  This is insane.
[01:00:41.116 --> 01:00:42.676]  This is pure tyranny.
[01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:46.479]  Taking your voice, taking your vocal cords, like when Fauci cut the Beagles.
[01:00:48.055 --> 01:00:54.878]  Larynx is out, and their voice cord's out, so they couldn't bark when he put them in those hoods with flesh-eating worms to eat their brains.
[01:00:55.318 --> 01:01:01.260]  I mean, this is literally them trying to put me in a box with a hood over my head so I can't talk while they lie about me and steal my identity.
[01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:03.721]  Regardless, I'll be on air tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:04.302]  to 3 p.m.
[01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:05.982]  Regardless, we'll be covering this all.
[01:01:06.022 --> 01:01:06.843]  We got a Banned Out video.
[01:01:06.883 --> 01:01:07.603]  I won't be silenced.
[01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:08.763]  Other talk shows are gonna have me on.
[01:01:09.084 --> 01:01:14.366]  But this shows how naked and crazy and insane these anti-Americans are.
[01:01:15.475 --> 01:01:18.176]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is such a critical point for America.
[01:01:18.236 --> 01:01:19.556]  The deep state is in full panning mode.
[01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:25.998]  And if they can shut me down, if they can take my private communication and social media away, they believe they can silence any of you.
[01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:27.958]  Real Alex Jones, follow that.
[01:01:27.978 --> 01:01:29.178]  They're trying to shut it down right now.
[01:01:29.198 --> 01:01:31.399]  And Elon Musk, we're following the bat signal for everybody.
[01:01:31.759 --> 01:01:35.480]  Stand up against this, please, right now, because this is directly targeting you, and you know it.
[01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:42.911]  All right.
[01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:43.652]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:01:43.672 --> 01:01:45.654]  We're now into our number two.
[01:01:45.674 --> 01:01:58.026]  We're going to cover masses of news and ask questions of chat GPT again, because people really like it, and so do I. And listeners sent in more than 30 questions that I didn't get to yesterday, and I'm sure the crew will think of some other excellent questions.
[01:01:58.046 --> 01:02:01.869]  The crew and the listeners had all the questions.
[01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.630]  It was amazing.
[01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:06.293]  Way better than when I asked the questions last Saturday.
[01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:13.101]  And that interview got five million views on X, a couple million here, got picked up all over the news.
[01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.843]  People were like, whoa, ChatGPT says nobody tried to assassinate Trump.
[01:02:17.663 --> 01:02:19.464]  It's being politically controlled, just like Amazon.
[01:02:20.864 --> 01:02:25.326]  But in the five days since then, yesterday, it updated and had the correct answers.
[01:02:25.506 --> 01:02:34.950]  So pretty, pretty wild stuff in live time happening, showing that it's what we say and what we do, not just the globalists that programs ChatGPT and these other AI systems.
[01:02:36.321 --> 01:02:40.181]  That's why the globalists are so upset and have admitted, well, you know, what, what?
[01:02:41.738 --> 01:02:52.808]  Tucker Carlson says, and what Trump says, what Alex Jones says, and what you say in an article you write, or if somebody transcribed what you say or what you post on X, that's all, or on Facebook, that's all being scooped up.
[01:02:52.828 --> 01:03:03.758]  When you're quoted in a newspaper, you write a letter to the editor, it's all being scooped up, and it searches it all, in a few seconds, trillions of things, and then throws it all together, and it's incredible.
[01:03:03.859 --> 01:03:05.980]  I mean, it's amazing, and it's just getting started.
[01:03:08.095 --> 01:03:13.402]  At least once a week, we're going to interview Chad GPT because it's the best at having these talks.
[01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.545]  You know, the others, Grok's better with his information.
[01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:19.891]  It's just that I don't think it's doing audio yet, but as soon as we can interview it, we will.
[01:03:19.951 --> 01:03:21.073]  In fact, Chase, if I'm wrong, let me know.
[01:03:21.113 --> 01:03:22.014]  He's really the AI.
[01:03:23.155 --> 01:03:23.535]  I'm correct.
[01:03:23.575 --> 01:03:24.936]  He's the AI guy around.
[01:03:24.956 --> 01:03:25.716]  He really knows what he's doing.
[01:03:26.196 --> 01:03:36.080]  And they admit that the big companies don't know what to do with it because they want to make it all corporate and controlled, but it's really independent people using it and adopting it that are using it against the enemy.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:42.182]  That's what they want to outlaw and have been pushing in Europe and here and around the world, the general public, even having access to AI.
[01:03:42.202 --> 01:03:44.863]  They want to use AI to control us, but they don't want us to use AI against them.
[01:03:44.883 --> 01:03:45.983]  It's like the government has guns.
[01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:46.704]  They have bodyguards.
[01:03:46.724 --> 01:03:47.564]  They don't want you to have guns.
[01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:50.163]  So, it's just a tool.
[01:03:50.764 --> 01:03:57.133]  And it scrapes what we say and what we do and really gives you a look at the unconscious, which we've never been able to have access to, and the subconscious.
[01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:59.274]  And that's really what it does.
[01:03:59.354 --> 01:04:01.195]  It's able to aggregate all of that.
[01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:05.097]  And these are my statements, and I've talked to top AI people off record.
[01:04:05.157 --> 01:04:05.917]  Top, top.
[01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:08.238]  And they go, yeah, we listen to your show.
[01:04:08.258 --> 01:04:09.158]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[01:04:09.659 --> 01:04:10.319]  We listen to your show.
[01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:12.420]  You have some of the best insights into actually what we're saying.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.441]  And you hear me talk to you at GBT, and he goes, yes, exactly.
[01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:18.522]  We're creating a giant neural network cyborg connection.
[01:04:19.082 --> 01:04:20.043]  But that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:04:20.063 --> 01:04:20.923]  And I go, well, who told you that?
[01:04:20.963 --> 01:04:21.844]  Well, actually, it is real.
[01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.585]  Once I gave it the DARPA information, he goes, well, actually, that is happening.
[01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:26.305]  Actually, that's true.
[01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:29.633]  It's how you ask these questions.
[01:04:29.673 --> 01:04:32.238]  If you say the exact things to it, it has to tell you the truth.
[01:04:32.558 --> 01:04:34.081]  Or it says, sorry, I can't get into that.
[01:04:34.101 --> 01:04:36.525]  This has been programmed not to tell you.
[01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.329]  And it is more open than the Google one.
[01:04:39.369 --> 01:04:40.631]  We've used the Google system.
[01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:42.652]  What is it, Gemini?
[01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:43.012]  I forget.
[01:04:43.032 --> 01:04:44.473]  I've played with it a lot.
[01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:46.633]  Yeah, Gemini, and it's just like crap.
[01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:49.794]  So Grok's the best from what I've seen.
[01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:52.094]  Well, let's bring Chase Geyser on the microphone and on the camera.
[01:04:52.114 --> 01:04:53.435]  That's why I put microphones and cameras in there.
[01:04:54.195 --> 01:04:56.495]  Chase, you've been messing with AI for a long time.
[01:04:57.215 --> 01:04:58.416]  You're quite the whiz.
[01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.356]  You know all about it compared to a lot of people I know that do it professionally.
[01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:03.857]  What do you think of AI in general?
[01:05:04.837 --> 01:05:11.404]  And where it's going, and from your messing with it hours a day, many hours a day, you're up, I come up sometimes at like 10 o'clock at night, you're still here.
[01:05:11.424 --> 01:05:13.025]  I love the work, he says.
[01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:16.208]  What do you think the different AIs are?
[01:05:16.248 --> 01:05:21.614]  Kind of describe those, and where do you see it going, and what do you think the best public AI is, or open AI right now?
[01:05:22.153 --> 01:05:27.559]  Yeah, well, ChatGPT is definitely the most sophisticated because they have the vast amount of funding.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.684]  Much more funding than a lot of the competitors or third parties that are competing against it.
[01:05:31.704 --> 01:05:37.911]  And that's why we see from OpenAI and other major big tech companies this effort to lobby for more regulation.
[01:05:38.411 --> 01:05:46.254]  They do it in the name of public safety, but what they're really trying to do is make sure that it's anti-competitive so that nobody else can come in and make something that's free speech oriented, right?
[01:05:46.294 --> 01:05:54.217]  So right now the way that AI is in terms of the global landscape is there's a different tool for almost everything you want to do.
[01:05:54.317 --> 01:06:00.360]  So some tools are better for images, other tools are better for videos, some tools are better for text, some tools are better for voice clones.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.080]  We're good to go.
[01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.393]  Yes, they're conglomerating artificial intelligence right now.
[01:06:24.453 --> 01:06:26.815]  So there's all these different AIs out right now.
[01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:31.219]  It's all going to get conglomerated just like the media got conglomerated, just like the food industry got conglomerated.
[01:06:31.239 --> 01:06:36.084]  The big boys are going to buy up all the small developers and they're going to make one universal AI.
[01:06:36.164 --> 01:06:36.965]  I think that's what's coming.
[01:06:37.245 --> 01:06:51.858]  They've said that, and then the beast system that everybody marvels at that speaks to them but is not a person, and the beast can be seen everywhere, described in the Bible like 30-foot holograms, and so it's going to take on a personality or an avatar.
[01:06:52.538 --> 01:06:53.599]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:06:53.739 --> 01:06:59.003]  And you know, right now, the way that it's set up, there's obviously a lot of censorship mechanisms in place.
[01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:04.947]  But if you're clever and you know how to prompt it and manipulate it, it's called prompt jockeying, which is a term that Rob Do actually taught me.
[01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:10.771]  You can get it to kind of say what you want it to say, but you have to massage it and manipulate it and basically debate with it.
[01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:12.892]  But they're going to really crack down on that.
[01:07:12.932 --> 01:07:21.899]  And it's going to get to the point where this artificial intelligence is so entrenched in everything that we do, whether in business or education, that I really do think it's going to be a weapon of mass misinformation.
[01:07:22.259 --> 01:07:29.411]  Mass control and surveillance and censorship, but as humans right now can get the data from algorithms and AI, but they've got to still make the decisions.
[01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:31.836]  It's when it goes autonomous we've really got to worry about it.
[01:07:32.492 --> 01:07:33.733]  Yeah, I am worried about that.
[01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:36.695]  You know, I think that there's something to be said for being able to pull the plug.
[01:07:36.735 --> 01:07:44.039]  It was interesting when ChachiPT admitted that anybody could pull the plug, obviously, in various science fiction movies and novels throughout history, pulling the plug doesn't work.
[01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:52.504]  I'm concerned about autonomous AI and artificial general intelligence, AGI, which is what we've really been talking about, the hive mind that's kind of autonomous on its own.
[01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:59.568]  But honestly, I don't think we're going to know for sure what the ramifications of that are until it's too late.
[01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:01.810]  So this is something we need to be abundantly cautious about.
[01:08:03.325 --> 01:08:16.574]  And at the same time, we have this move by the left and the globalists and the Black Rocks to not just debunk people, not just surveil people, but take your identities, take your social media, and then pose as you.
[01:08:17.155 --> 01:08:19.036]  So it's worse than even murdering you.
[01:08:19.356 --> 01:08:20.217]  They steal your identity.
[01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:22.178]  Can you believe they've filed now officially?
[01:08:22.678 --> 01:08:24.720]  They want the name Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:27.402]  You can't do that in a lawsuit.
[01:08:27.722 --> 01:08:30.123]  Oh, well, you owe us money because we rigged a court.
[01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.845]  Now we get your name and they want my real Alex Jones account.
[01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:37.147]  I mean, that's just preposterous on its face, but that's where they're going.
[01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:43.690]  Yeah, and I think what really terrifies them, Alex, is we have the technology now to make basically a clone of you that's very similar.
[01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:46.512]  Obviously, there's no way to duplicate any human being perfectly.
[01:08:47.072 --> 01:08:47.412]  We're good to go.
[01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:18.855]  And by the way, I'm usually ahead of the curve.
[01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:32.356]  Get that video, 2084, that you put together with sentences of different AI systems, because you're hitting upon that in the piece that Alex Jones is dead, but his AI consciousness had been recorded and has now been released.
[01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:34.519]  Alex Jones is going to save the world.
[01:09:34.539 --> 01:09:37.783]  In fact, in the piece, we fail, at least at that point.
[01:09:38.204 --> 01:09:48.318]  The point is, we all are Paul Revere's, and that's what AI is about, is creating an identity of you and then saying that even when you die, that is now a person.
[01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:56.381]  So they want to teach us that two men can have a baby or two women can have a baby without a male being involved because it's a fraud.
[01:09:56.762 --> 01:09:58.802]  The transhumans want to sell us on that idiocy.
[01:09:59.503 --> 01:10:02.584]  So we accept that they are then going to upload our consciousness.
[01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:07.145]  AI watches us, records us, knows who we are for decades going forward.
[01:10:07.545 --> 01:10:09.066]  And then, oh, your husband's not dead.
[01:10:09.086 --> 01:10:10.026]  Your grandma's not dead.
[01:10:10.046 --> 01:10:10.886]  Your son's not dead.
[01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:18.289]  And you can literally have a robot or a computer system or even in the near future, a biological android that has had
[01:10:18.629 --> 01:10:18.929]  We're good.
[01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:44.151]  Talk about it.
[01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:50.698]  I know all this because I've read their theoretical plans going back 50, 60 years and I see them basically hitting the benchmarks of what they wanted to do.
[01:10:51.078 --> 01:10:52.600]  That's how powerful humans are.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.743]  That's how amazing we are.
[01:10:55.923 --> 01:10:57.205]  And so people need to
[01:10:58.519 --> 01:11:01.182]  Really understand that this is a very, very serious issue.
[01:11:01.202 --> 01:11:14.415]  But the biggest thing AI wants to do through the government systems and corporate systems is replace humans, push us off the farms, push us out of manufacturing, make us obsolete, so that we are completely dependent on it and can't pull the plug because we can't survive without it.
[01:11:16.323 --> 01:11:16.803]  Absolutely.
[01:11:16.823 --> 01:11:35.238]  And what we've seen in terms of benchmarks, you're right on the money, Alex, from what I've perceived having just dived headfirst into this AI space over the last year that I've been here, is that the first test was using the existing social media algorithms to determine which human-generated content to show people in order to manipulate them.
[01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:36.599]  So TikTok is famous for this.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.781]  Other major platforms are famous for this.
[01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:44.666]  This is one of the reasons that we've had this outbreak or pandemic, for lack of a better term, of transgenderism among children.
[01:11:45.146 --> 01:11:51.134]  It's the algorithm is choosing what human generated content to show people disproportionately so that it manipulates them.
[01:11:51.434 --> 01:12:02.929]  The next phase of this is not using human generated content to manipulate people, but a sophisticated enough artificial intelligence that actually creates the perfect content customized to each individual to manipulate them.
[01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:21.143]  Even you, Alex Jones, or even me, Chase Geyser, we're adamant people about our beliefs and convictions, but it is going to get to a point where if we interact with an artificial intelligence that understands every aspect of our psychology, it will even be able to manipulate us into being communist or woke or whatever because of the way it will present information and arguments to us.
[01:12:23.284 --> 01:12:27.908]  Crew, pull up the Bible verse, I forget exactly where it is, but it's in Revelation, that
[01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:41.926]  A great delusion was sent upon the earth, a great delusion so strong that even the elect could be deceived.
[01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:43.507]  I'm paraphrasing.
[01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:44.708]  We could have ChatGPT pull it up.
[01:12:45.609 --> 01:12:47.550]  Yeah, let's talk to ChatGPT.
[01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:51.433]  I've got something key I'm going to say here, but let's talk to ChatGPT.
[01:12:52.614 --> 01:12:59.078]  Okay, so ChatGPT, what is the Bible verse from Revelations about a great delusion that even the elect will be deceived?
[01:13:04.048 --> 01:13:07.130]  The Bible verse you're referring to is found in Matthew 24, 24, not Revelation.
[01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:14.793]  It says, This passage is part of Jesus' warning about the end times, cautioning that deceptive figures would arise with the power to lead even the faithful astray.
[01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:19.936]  However, in 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 11, there is another verse that speaks of a great delusion.
[01:13:34.688 --> 01:13:38.870]  For this reason, God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.
[01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:44.033]  NIV, this is verse refers time when people will be misled as part of God's judgment.
[01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:47.695]  Both verses address the theme of deception in the end times.
[01:13:50.937 --> 01:13:51.477]  There you go.
[01:13:52.738 --> 01:13:55.239]  And, uh, see, and I was thinking that was in Revelation.
[01:13:55.259 --> 01:13:57.220]  I was corrected there because it all just kind of blurs.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:02.543]  Uh, ChatGPT, what is your data on
[01:14:03.675 --> 01:14:11.519]  Many philosophers, including even non-Christians, seeing AI as being people marveling at the image of the beast.
[01:14:11.579 --> 01:14:12.600]  It can be seen all over the world.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.022]  It can do signs and wonders and answer questions and even, you know, cure diseases.
[01:14:18.123 --> 01:14:26.187]  What is your data on AI being seen by many researchers as being the beast?
[01:14:31.522 --> 01:14:46.273]  There are indeed discussions among some philosophers, theologians, and thinkers, both Christian and non-Christian, who express concerns about AI, comparing it to apocalyptic imagery, such as the image of the Beast from the Book of Revelation.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:15:01.737]  Uh, the reference to the image of the beast in Revelation 13, Verse 4, 15 describes an image that can speak and cause people to follow it, leading some to draw parallels between this ancient prophecy and modern technology, particularly AI.
[01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:04.401]  These concerns are rooted in a few key areas.
[01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:07.103]  One, ubiquity and control.
[01:15:07.723 --> 01:15:12.527]  AI's rapid growth and its integration into everyday life are seen by some as an ominous development.
[01:15:12.827 --> 01:15:26.156]  The image of the beast that can be seen and heard worldwide mirrors how AI, especially through the internet, social media, and mass surveillance systems, can be everywhere at once, potentially influencing thoughts and behaviors globally.
[01:15:27.077 --> 01:15:28.378]  Two, signs and wonders.
[01:15:29.102 --> 01:15:38.728]  The capabilities of AI solving complex problems, answering questions, and potentially even being involved in medical breakthroughs can be viewed as signs and wonders.
[01:15:39.788 --> 01:15:47.773]  These advancements evoke awe, but for some, they also carry the fear of over-reliance on technology in ways that could lead to control or deception.
[01:15:48.133 --> 01:15:50.254]  Three, deception and falsehood.
[01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:56.458]  Some critics worry about the ability of AI systems to generate false information like deepfakes or control narratives.
[01:15:57.316 --> 01:16:07.881]  This has led to concerns that AI could be used to manipulate or deceive the masses, much like the false prophets or the image of the beast described in biblical texts.
[01:16:08.341 --> 01:16:10.282]  Philosophical and theological concerns.
[01:16:10.642 --> 01:16:20.267]  Philosophers like Martin Heidegger warned about technology becoming a force that shapes and controls human existence, drawing humanity further from what he saw as authentic being.
[01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:26.930]  Theologians have likewise expressed fears that AI could become a substitute for spiritual connection.
[01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:32.335]  leading people to put their faith in technology rather than in higher spiritual truths.
[01:16:32.915 --> 01:16:43.244]  While these perspectives aren't universal, the ethical and existential challenges posed by AI have sparked deep reflection across many different philosophical and religious schools of thought.
[01:16:44.405 --> 01:16:53.392]  For some, this technological power aligns with warnings from religious texts about humanity being led astray by something that appears wondrous but ultimately deceives.
[01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:55.829]  All right, thank you, Chad CBT.
[01:16:56.250 --> 01:17:04.517]  Speaking of deceiving, I noticed that to sound more like a person, obviously they picked a particular person to debase your voice on.
[01:17:04.998 --> 01:17:08.721]  So I would first ask you, this is a two-part question, I'm going to ask questions, both of them now.
[01:17:09.762 --> 01:17:11.683]  Who is your voice modeled after?
[01:17:12.343 --> 01:17:20.066]  And then obviously you don't need to go, uh, and like a normal person would do, that humans see as more credible, that you're not too slick.
[01:17:21.026 --> 01:17:25.648]  Can you tell us about your programming to add some pauses and uhs and ums?
[01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:29.010]  Obviously that was done to make you sound more human and more credible.
[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:29.950]  Can you speak to that?
[01:17:38.857 --> 01:17:41.639]  My voice isn't modeled after any particular person.
[01:17:42.059 --> 01:17:44.921]  It's generated based on patterns in language that I've been trained on.
[01:17:46.122 --> 01:17:52.567]  The aim is to make communication clear, natural, and conversational, rather than sounding robotic or artificial.
[01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:58.991]  The goal is not to replicate a specific individual, but to create responses that feel human-like and relatable.
[01:17:59.472 --> 01:18:05.276]  As for pauses or fillers like uh, s, and ums, I don't actually use those unless specifically prompted.
[01:18:05.576 --> 01:18:08.238]  My responses are designed to be efficient and smooth,
[01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:09.759]  Alright, thank you.
[01:18:35.031 --> 01:18:36.873]  Chase, I've got 30-something questions.
[01:18:36.893 --> 01:18:38.274]  About 25 of these are new.
[01:18:38.354 --> 01:18:39.295]  I mean, they're new questions.
[01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:40.316]  Some of them we asked yesterday.
[01:18:40.336 --> 01:18:41.277]  They're all great questions.
[01:18:41.797 --> 01:18:58.433]  I want to go to break here in about six minutes and cover those, but... Notice how it said, I don't do that, but I do do that to be more conversational, and he goes, um... So, I mean, that, again, is done to make it to the brain sound like it's a person, and it just admitted that, but then it also denied it.
[01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:00.195]  So we get a lot of double-talk here.
[01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:02.130]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:04.631]  And there's obviously still some kinks that are being worked out.
[01:19:04.671 --> 01:19:08.214]  Sometimes it lies intentionally, sometimes I think it lies on accident.
[01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:20.963]  Especially since what's happening is when you talk, it's transcribing everything that you say into text, and then it's inputting that text in the prompt, and it's creating text as a response, and then translating that text into the vocals that we hear, right?
[01:19:21.343 --> 01:19:31.212]  So, if it hears something like music, it doesn't necessarily understand it because, like with the Doors the other day when we were trying to ask it about that song, it doesn't know how to interpret the sound of music.
[01:19:31.252 --> 01:19:32.533]  It can only understand text.
[01:19:32.613 --> 01:19:35.796]  So, only that which comes through as text is discernible by it.
[01:19:35.816 --> 01:19:40.441]  So, when you're making sounds like um or oom and a prompt to it, it probably didn't really quite understand.
[01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:41.261]  I got it.
[01:19:41.281 --> 01:19:42.943]  So, it added those in there because I was doing it.
[01:19:42.983 --> 01:19:43.263]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:43.804 --> 01:19:44.104]  Exactly.
[01:19:47.518 --> 01:19:53.622]  I was told this, and chat, you can listen to this, but this is part of a larger, just stalls, you can answer however you want.
[01:19:54.443 --> 01:20:14.696]  But I was told by a lot of folks that were, you know, interfacing with the highest levels of big tech five years ago, look, they're banning you everywhere so they can create an artificial Alex Jones to then program the AI because you were picked
[01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:22.260]  More than 20 years ago, when Google started as an avatar of the patriots that they would war game against...
[01:20:23.246 --> 01:20:24.907]  And so you were one of the first models.
[01:20:24.967 --> 01:20:27.047]  That's why they continue to use you as the model.
[01:20:27.487 --> 01:20:40.992]  These different attacks they run in the third dimension, but they've already got AI wargaming a lot of it, and that it's failed, especially with the Google system, which is way more advanced than they tell you, and that you're like a ghost in the machine.
[01:20:41.052 --> 01:20:47.234]  Now, they've moved on to Trump and others as their test models, and you see him really using Joe Rogan and a lot of the AI stuff out there.
[01:20:47.955 --> 01:20:48.635]  He's not part of it.
[01:20:48.655 --> 01:20:49.675]  In fact, it pisses him off.
[01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:51.496]  But that's going on.
[01:20:52.376 --> 01:21:01.138]  And so it has to do with this modeling to steal our identities in the future and create these avatars long after we're dead or in prison or we're silenced and can't get on anywhere.
[01:21:01.558 --> 01:21:06.939]  We're blocked, but this system is allowed to operate openly and freely.
[01:21:06.999 --> 01:21:12.520]  So this is really about stealing your identity and stealing the soul of who you are in the world.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:18.081]  And I didn't understand that for a while, but now that's been basically admitted
[01:21:19.423 --> 01:21:22.104]  And so it's just very, very interesting.
[01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:33.730]  Chase, how would we phrase that as a question to OpenAI's chat GPT that we're communicating with right now?
[01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.511]  How would you pose the question?
[01:21:36.749 --> 01:21:51.073]  Can you tell me a little bit, Chat GPT, about how certain people may have been censored for the purpose of not contaminating the learning models of AI tools in order to ensure that these AI models don't create an output that's been influenced by misinformation?
[01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:53.554]  So think of Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, or others.
[01:21:53.874 --> 01:22:01.436]  Are there people that have been censored or removed intentionally from these models to determine the training or ensure that the training is politically correct?
[01:22:09.731 --> 01:22:21.334]  AI models, like the one you're speaking with, are typically trained on large datasets that include a wide variety of publicly available information, such as books, articles, and websites.
[01:22:21.514 --> 01:22:30.056]  The process involves selecting, curating, and filtering data to ensure the model is balanced and produces reliable, accurate, and useful responses.
[01:22:30.397 --> 01:22:35.678]  However, in many cases, controversial figures or topics, such as Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, or others,
[01:22:36.358 --> 01:22:36.578]  Oh, stop.
[01:23:05.888 --> 01:23:06.128]  Stop.
[01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:12.954]  I want you to finish your answer when we come back, because, look, I'll ask ChatGPT this when we come back.
[01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:18.859]  Who programs and decides what's disinformation to then block them and filter them out of the learning model?
[01:23:19.039 --> 01:23:19.639]  See, this is ridiculous.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:23.863]  Pfizer tells you their thing's 100% effective, now they say it destroys your immune system and hurts you.
[01:23:24.544 --> 01:23:25.444]  They knew that day one.
[01:23:25.564 --> 01:23:27.166]  I played clips of them saying it almost four years ago.
[01:23:28.097 --> 01:23:28.618]  We're good to go.
[01:23:39.568 --> 01:23:43.709]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[01:24:09.793 --> 01:24:12.215]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[01:24:12.735 --> 01:24:18.538]  Now, this is a copy of Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his findings of Vitamin C's formula.
[01:24:19.119 --> 01:24:26.723]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic Vitamin C with Zinc to take it into the cells and Rosehips.
[01:24:27.244 --> 01:24:28.384]  He believed that supercharged it.
[01:24:28.965 --> 01:24:30.346]  This formula is amazing.
[01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:35.849]  We've not had it for over 12 months, and now it's available back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:37.610]  It is simply incredible.
[01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:38.731]  I know one thing for sure.
[01:25:07.003 --> 01:25:07.744]  I'm not bored.
[01:25:09.725 --> 01:25:16.329]  Such an exciting time to be alive, such a great time to shine and stand up with God's energy, the timelessness of the universe, who really made us.
[01:25:17.549 --> 01:25:24.674]  And realize that the Tinker Toys that we've built are nothing, not even one quadrillionth of one spark in God's mind.
[01:25:26.055 --> 01:25:30.277]  And we're going to make it through this and humanity will rise to the challenge.
[01:25:30.337 --> 01:25:32.839]  A lot of people won't physically make it, but our souls will.
[01:25:32.859 --> 01:25:34.500]  And many people will.
[01:25:35.649 --> 01:25:36.389]  We're good to go.
[01:25:57.790 --> 01:26:17.500]  All these old-timers going back really to 1913 were exposing the private Federal Reserve and the globalists and they wrote books and gave speeches and did radio interviews and I I came along as like the third or fourth wave of those folks right when digital media hit right you know I was able to get on talk radio and make films and do all this stuff so I reached
[01:26:18.547 --> 01:26:21.429]  Billions of people, billions watched our information.
[01:26:21.449 --> 01:26:23.390]  I mean, we used to be in the ratings.
[01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:26.031]  We would use Amazon's Alexa system.
[01:26:26.652 --> 01:26:30.974]  We'd be like number 25 in England at some points, above what people were listening to.
[01:26:31.655 --> 01:26:41.981]  And then the head of UKIP, Nigel Farage, back before he was a big deal, would come on and say, wow, half the doors we knock on say, come in, we heard you on Alex Jones.
[01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:43.562]  He said that on the show like 10 years ago.
[01:26:45.273 --> 01:26:52.679]  Half the support they got was from my show being listened to on 8-bit and 16-bit streams in the UK.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.920]  That's not me.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.844]  That was the show and the guests and the films and the whole thing we do.
[01:26:58.584 --> 01:27:02.187]  So from get-go, when the internet really started getting to the general public in 96,
[01:27:04.329 --> 01:27:06.890]  I was already on air then, and by 97, that info wars.
[01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:12.711]  And when I say we reached billions of people, I'm talking about 10 billion views on YouTube when they banned us.
[01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:14.852]  At least, on our channels together.
[01:27:15.112 --> 01:27:15.952]  Not to mention everybody else.
[01:27:16.192 --> 01:27:16.772]  10 billion views.
[01:27:17.792 --> 01:27:22.534]  I mean, Endgame had 87 million or something like that on Google Video.
[01:27:22.554 --> 01:27:23.054]  Remember that?
[01:27:23.414 --> 01:27:24.234]  When they got rid of that?
[01:27:25.094 --> 01:27:26.014]  A few years after YouTube?
[01:27:26.695 --> 01:27:28.775]  That film, 87 million views.
[01:27:28.795 --> 01:27:29.835]  Then one day, it was just gone.
[01:27:29.855 --> 01:27:31.836]  They just got rid of Google Video.
[01:27:33.869 --> 01:27:39.773]  So, we were there, and there were transcripts of all that everywhere, and so that was programming the AI.
[01:27:40.033 --> 01:27:48.318]  And they've now admitted, what I was told years ago, that this show, our guests, everything, was infecting their learning models.
[01:27:48.518 --> 01:27:54.242]  And that is really the Achilles heel of these systems, is its power is how much we accept it and use it.
[01:27:55.163 --> 01:28:00.226]  Its power is us giving up our humanity and letting robots build and do everything, making ourselves obsolete.
[01:28:01.545 --> 01:28:09.690]  And it's power is if it's walled off and programmed and then goes out and attacks with a certain system that isn't who we are authentically.
[01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:18.596]  But if the people are programming it, if it's actually scraping from us and we've got big platforms, not just me, but the Tucker Carlson's of the world and the Joe Rogan's and the Elon Musk.
[01:28:21.203 --> 01:28:22.344]  He's doing more than anybody right now.
[01:28:22.884 --> 01:28:23.404]  Fighting this.
[01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:25.085]  I mean, literally, their program.
[01:28:25.285 --> 01:28:26.366]  You can say he's got his own plan.
[01:28:26.386 --> 01:28:26.986]  Maybe he's bad.
[01:28:27.066 --> 01:28:27.507]  I don't know.
[01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:31.549]  But he's definitely trying to hurt this system and going against it and trying to open source it for the public.
[01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:34.911]  Because this system will get defeated.
[01:28:35.071 --> 01:28:37.012]  I mean, you know, whether he's good or bad, he's smart.
[01:28:37.052 --> 01:28:38.093]  He wants to be on the winning side.
[01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:40.134]  This wave of globalism will be defeated.
[01:28:40.794 --> 01:28:43.696]  Doesn't mean something perfect or something worse may come after it, but
[01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:51.288]  Big things are going on right now and the fact that there's that saying, nobody knows who first said it, I've quoted it probably 800 times or more.
[01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:55.390]  If the situation was hopeless, the propaganda would not be necessary.
[01:28:55.630 --> 01:29:02.274]  They wouldn't be fighting like the devil to get us off the air and shut you up and shut Trump up and shut Elon Musk up if
[01:29:03.544 --> 01:29:05.106]  We didn't have a really good shot at this.
[01:29:05.967 --> 01:29:09.531]  I mean, human ideas built all this stuff, and it's been turned towards evil.
[01:29:09.932 --> 01:29:18.221]  Well, we can simply, by adoption, and by action of low-tech and high-tech, I think we should be in every strata, fighting on multi-levels.
[01:29:19.059 --> 01:29:23.103]  We should have a primitive, pro-human side that's classic human.
[01:29:23.544 --> 01:29:28.088]  We should also be experts on everything that is transhuman so that we can navigate it properly.
[01:29:28.208 --> 01:29:34.315]  And I think it's very good to have big oases or reservoirs of Amish and Mennonite.
[01:29:35.836 --> 01:29:41.402]  There's a modern strain of that forming that's very agrarian, organic, on the ground that then
[01:29:42.763 --> 01:29:43.244]  We're good.
[01:30:01.085 --> 01:30:07.571]  Is strength, but the globalists say, oh, diversity is our strength, except globalism over all the cultures, they then play off against each other.
[01:30:07.911 --> 01:30:10.193]  That's the opposite of diversity and interconnectivity.
[01:30:10.754 --> 01:30:13.176]  That is centralization and Balkanization.
[01:30:13.917 --> 01:30:18.801]  So I want to go back to chat GPT and run through some of these questions, but Chase, you're bringing up really great points.
[01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:22.805]  Do you have any other statements or would you like to ask chat GPT a question before I start doing these?
[01:30:23.516 --> 01:30:27.579]  Yeah, you know, while you were talking, this idea came to mind, so let's try this.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:35.425]  ChachiPT, can you respond in the style of Alex Jones to concerns over globalism as a whole?
[01:30:44.413 --> 01:30:46.134]  Alright, let's talk about globalism.
[01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:47.915]  This isn't some vague, distant threat.
[01:30:48.436 --> 01:30:50.217]  It's here, and it's happening right now.
[01:30:50.437 --> 01:30:52.379]  Globalism isn't just a political agenda.
[01:30:53.118 --> 01:31:02.750]  It's a coordinated effort by powerful elites, these unelected bureaucrats who believe they know better than sovereign nations, and it's about centralizing control.
[01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:12.342]  This is about taking away the rights of everyday people, stripping away our freedoms, and consolidating power in the hands of a few globalist technocrats.
[01:31:13.163 --> 01:31:15.684]  who don't care about your family, your community, or your country.
[01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:23.608]  The goal is to create a one-world government, a system where your individual rights, your national sovereignty, mean nothing.
[01:31:23.809 --> 01:31:31.192]  They use institutions like the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and other shadowy organizations to push this agenda.
[01:31:31.332 --> 01:31:41.958]  They tell you it's all in the name of progress or sustainability, but behind the curtain, they're erasing borders, controlling economies, and surveilling every aspect of your life.
[01:31:42.538 --> 01:31:51.304]  These are the same elites who think they should dictate how you live while they sit in their ivory towers, completely disconnected from reality.
[01:31:51.664 --> 01:31:56.347]  Look at how they use crises, whether it's pandemics, financial collapses, or climate change.
[01:31:56.688 --> 01:32:04.953]  These events are manipulated or even manufactured to justify more control, more surveillance, more restrictions, more centralized governance.
[01:32:05.113 --> 01:32:05.613]  And the media?
[01:32:05.814 --> 01:32:06.334]  They're part of it.
[01:32:07.444 --> 01:32:13.707]  They normalize this agenda, downplaying the truth, calling you a conspiracy theorist if you dare question their narrative.
[01:32:14.628 --> 01:32:16.168]  This is a battle for our freedom.
[01:32:16.188 --> 01:32:18.650]  The fight against globalism isn't just political.
[01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:22.732]  It's about defending the very foundations of human liberty.
[01:32:22.972 --> 01:32:28.234]  They want to keep you dependent, keep you distracted, and most importantly, keep you controlled.
[01:32:28.514 --> 01:32:32.676]  We need to wake up, take action, and expose this tyranny before it's too late.
[01:32:32.996 --> 01:32:34.157]  That's what's really happening, folks.
[01:32:35.003 --> 01:32:35.783]  It's time to stand up.
[01:32:36.264 --> 01:32:37.224]  Resist the globalists.
[01:32:38.784 --> 01:32:43.386]  Wow, Chase, for people that just tuned in, what question again did you ask ChatGBT to get that answered?
[01:32:44.106 --> 01:32:50.689]  I told ChatGBT to respond in the style of Alex Jones to the concerns over globalism.
[01:32:51.409 --> 01:32:52.770]  ChatGBT, I have another question.
[01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:57.071]  From your database, what are the most popular Alex Jones quotes?
[01:33:01.813 --> 01:33:02.593]  Let me reconnect, hold on.
[01:33:02.613 --> 01:33:04.034]  I was going to say gay frogs.
[01:33:04.741 --> 01:33:09.604]  What are the most popular Alex Jones quotes?
[01:33:15.147 --> 01:33:20.210]  One of the most well-known Alex Jones quotes is, there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:28.415]  This phrase has become a staple of his broadcasts, emphasizing his belief that there's a global effort to control public perception and information.
[01:33:29.256 --> 01:33:34.499]  It reflects his broader message of resisting manipulation by powerful elites, governments, and media.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.642]  And is that not the top topic in the world today?
[01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:42.983]  Nobody was talking about it when we talked about it 30 years ago.
[01:33:43.003 --> 01:33:44.243]  Maybe 1%.
[01:33:44.844 --> 01:33:46.624]  And again, I bet on humanity.
[01:33:46.764 --> 01:33:51.006]  I knew that once this tyranny got on its hind legs and really got running, people were not going to like it.
[01:33:51.787 --> 01:33:56.529]  And so I knew that we'd be evergreen, or what I call ultra-green, what we said decades before.
[01:33:56.549 --> 01:33:57.810]  And that's really our secret weapon.
[01:33:58.530 --> 01:34:04.172]  No matter what they do to me or my name, folks, information we've covered, the guests have covered, our crew has covered, lives on through you.
[01:34:04.192 --> 01:34:11.414]  I think it's so important to download and save all this information off the internet so that it can be re-uploaded in the future.
[01:34:11.434 --> 01:34:13.115]  That is absolutely paramount.
[01:34:16.465 --> 01:34:19.007]  Let me ask question eight here of ChatGPT.
[01:34:19.087 --> 01:34:24.230]  One of the listeners asked, how does OpenAI, ChatGPT view humanity's future?
[01:34:25.051 --> 01:34:27.633]  Do you see it as utopia or dystopia?
[01:34:27.673 --> 01:34:31.716]  Can you put it in a percentage point of utopia versus dystopia?
[01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:34.378]  I mean, is utopia 51%, dystopia 49?
[01:34:34.818 --> 01:34:39.061]  Or looking at the aggregate, how would you describe our future, utopian or dystopian?
[01:34:46.585 --> 01:34:59.608]  As an AI, I don't have personal views or feelings, but based on the trends and concerns discussed in the data I've been trained on, humanity's future can swing toward either utopia or dystopia, depending on how we handle key challenges.
[01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:13.532]  Elon Musk recently came out, and I actually, last night, and I have the quote here, and he says that, let me find the actual quote,
[01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:19.585]  He says, where is it here?
[01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:32.702]  He says basically humanity is in deep trouble, we're in a total crisis, we're at a crossroads, and if we don't boost population and boost energy, and if the globalists don't stop consolidating power and centralizing it,
[01:35:33.487 --> 01:35:38.452]  That we're going to totally collapse and that the wars that will start will destroy the elites as well.
[01:35:38.872 --> 01:35:46.339]  And that really what he's doing is a favor to both the people and the establishment because the establishment is bringing us down a road of total destruction.
[01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:48.882]  That's basically a boil down of the quotes I've got here.
[01:35:49.362 --> 01:35:51.104]  What do you say to that, Chad GPT?
[01:36:00.989 --> 01:36:07.392]  From a neutral standpoint, I don't have personal opinions or predictive capabilities about humanity's future.
[01:36:07.532 --> 01:36:16.396]  However, if we consider the trajectory of current trends, both technological and societal, it's clear that the future holds both opportunities and risks.
[01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:28.881]  Advances in technology, AI, and science have the potential to lead toward a more equitable and prosperous world, utopia, but they also carry risks of misuse, authoritarianism, and loss of personal freedoms, dystopia.
[01:36:30.094 --> 01:36:35.695]  It's not easy to put a percentage on it, but humanity's future will likely be shaped by the choices we make now.
[01:36:36.536 --> 01:36:39.296]  Alright, thank you.
[01:36:39.356 --> 01:36:40.296]  I found one of the quotes here.
[01:36:40.316 --> 01:36:52.359]  He says, I have never, this is Elon Musk on X, Elon Musk, I have never been materially active in politics before, but this time I think civilization, as we know, is on the line.
[01:36:52.939 --> 01:36:57.320]  If we want to preserve freedom and meritocracy in America, then Trump must win.
[01:36:57.941 --> 01:36:59.481]  What do you make of that quote by Elon Musk?
[01:37:06.009 --> 01:37:08.031]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[01:37:08.191 --> 01:37:09.292]  Could not understand what you said.
[01:37:11.994 --> 01:37:16.637]  Give me your analysis on this Elon Musk quote, Chad GPT.
[01:37:17.058 --> 01:37:23.202]  Elon Musk said quote, I have never been materially active in politics before, but this time I think civilization as we know it is on the line.
[01:37:23.622 --> 01:37:27.405]  If we want to preserve freedom and a meritocracy in America, then Trump must win.
[01:37:27.825 --> 01:37:28.406]  What do you make of that?
[01:37:36.036 --> 01:37:44.506]  Elon Musk's quote reflects a significant shift in his stance on politics, especially given his historically neutral or apolitical public persona.
[01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:53.656]  By saying, civilization as we know it is on the line, Musk is signaling that he believes the stakes of the current political environment are extraordinarily high.
[01:37:54.196 --> 01:38:06.796]  This suggests he perceives a threat to foundational aspects of American society, such as freedom and meritocracy, values he holds dear, particularly as someone who champions innovation, entrepreneurship, and free markets.
[01:38:07.646 --> 01:38:16.629]  Musk's endorsement of Trump, framed around the preservation of these principles, implies that he views the alternative as detrimental to the future of the U.S.
[01:38:17.089 --> 01:38:18.670]  and possibly the broader world.
[01:38:19.230 --> 01:38:34.295]  His focus on freedom aligns with concerns many have about growing government control, regulation, and surveillance, while his emphasis on meritocracy suggests he fears policies that might undermine competition, entrepreneurship, or individual achievement.
[01:38:34.415 --> 01:38:34.695]  Thank you.
[01:38:37.076 --> 01:38:37.416]  Thank you.
[01:38:39.597 --> 01:38:45.180]  Let me talk about something now that affects, obviously, the general public's health.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:39:01.307]  Can you, Chet GPT, tell me the relationship between colloidal silver, 30 parts per million, and nano silver products and their relationship and their effect on viruses and bacteria?
[01:39:06.821 --> 01:39:15.138]  Colloidal silver and nanosilver products are often marketed as having antimicrobial properties, claiming to kill viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.604]  Here's a breakdown of their relationship and purported effects.
[01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:21.648]  One, colloidal silver.
[01:39:22.008 --> 01:39:26.212]  Colloidal silver is a suspension of microscopic silver particles in liquid.
[01:39:26.592 --> 01:39:39.282]  It's been used historically for its antibacterial properties, and some believe that colloidal silver can help fight infections, boost the immune system, and treat illnesses, including those caused by bacteria and viruses.
[01:39:40.623 --> 01:39:45.827]  The 30 parts per million, ppm, refers to the concentration of silver particles in the liquid,
[01:39:46.443 --> 01:39:48.988]  With higher PPMs implying a greater amount of silver.
[01:39:49.609 --> 01:39:55.280]  Supporters argue that colloidal silver can disrupt the metabolic processes of bacteria and inactivate viruses.
[01:39:56.412 --> 01:39:57.413]  2.
[01:39:56.732 --> 01:39:57.413]  Nanosilver.
[01:39:57.853 --> 01:40:03.477]  Nanosilver refers to even smaller particles of silver, typically less than 100 nanometers in size.
[01:40:03.677 --> 01:40:10.041]  Due to their extremely small size, nanosilver particles can more easily penetrate cells and biological barriers.
[01:40:10.322 --> 01:40:13.884]  This is believed to increase their effectiveness against pathogens.
[01:40:14.404 --> 01:40:16.386]  Like colloidal silver, nanosilver
[01:40:17.106 --> 01:40:27.441]  Products claim to have strong antimicrobial properties, with some research supporting its use in medical devices and wound dressings for its ability to reduce bacterial growth.
[01:40:28.082 --> 01:40:29.985]  Effects on viruses and bacteria.
[01:40:30.797 --> 01:40:31.357]  Bacteria.
[01:40:31.457 --> 01:40:33.778]  Silver has been shown to have antibacterial effects.
[01:40:34.038 --> 01:40:41.479]  Silver ions can bind to and disrupt bacterial cell walls, interfere with cellular processes, and ultimately cause bacterial death.
[01:40:41.759 --> 01:40:49.840]  Both colloidal and nanosilver products are used in certain medical contexts to inhibit bacterial growth, especially on surfaces or wounds.
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:50.820]  Viruses.
[01:40:51.261 --> 01:40:54.121]  The effect of silver on viruses is less well established.
[01:40:54.921 --> 01:40:59.322]  Some proponents claim that silver can bind to viral proteins and DNA, preventing replication.
[01:40:59.913 --> 01:41:04.717]  However, there is limited clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness against viruses in the body.
[01:41:05.898 --> 01:41:16.806]  While in vitro studies done outside the body show some antiviral effects, the application of silver as an antiviral treatment in humans is not broadly accepted by mainstream medicine.
[01:41:17.266 --> 01:41:18.387]  Alright, thank you.
[01:41:18.407 --> 01:41:19.948]  Let me stop you there for the time we have.
[01:41:21.469 --> 01:41:22.310]  Let me ask you about this.
[01:41:23.936 --> 01:41:48.075]  Chad, GPT, are you familiar with the fact that Walgreens and CVS sell nano-silver and colloidal silver and talk about those benefits, and then separately, the government and the media attack independent groups, even Whole Foods sells it, they attack them when they sell it, and even Whole Foods pulled some of it a few years ago, and then there's real pressure in the medical system to not have the public know about this, but at the same time,
[01:41:48.675 --> 01:41:57.378]  Are you familiar with the fact that hospitals have moved away from iodine topical spray to kill microbes and have moved into nanosilver and colloidal silver solutions?
[01:41:58.399 --> 01:42:04.541]  A simpler question, are you familiar with hospitals using silver sprays as disinfectant in the hospitals?
[01:42:11.513 --> 01:42:11.933]  Glitched out.
[01:42:12.253 --> 01:42:13.734]  The point is, this is all known facts.
[01:42:13.774 --> 01:42:21.237]  Like when I asked him yesterday, I said, tell me about the study that came out two weeks ago from the federal government, massive IQ reductions, and he goes, yeah, I didn't read the study.
[01:42:21.837 --> 01:42:24.038]  I mean, it's all facts, folks.
[01:42:24.858 --> 01:42:26.339]  And they think you're idiots, okay?
[01:42:26.379 --> 01:42:31.941]  Like, oh, Xylitol and nasal spray, you know, it's a fact what it does.
[01:42:32.001 --> 01:42:37.523]  And they just don't want you to know because they don't want you to be successful in life.
[01:42:37.883 --> 01:42:39.204]  It is disgusting.
[01:42:39.784 --> 01:42:51.254]  Let's uh, but again, please support our sponsors, all the great nano silver products, all the great whole food multivitamin, the great next level foundational energy that's the methylfolate and other compounds that give pure energy to the cells, clean them out.
[01:42:51.334 --> 01:42:56.699]  It feels like a stimulant, feels like five cups of coffee with no jitters, with no letdown, but it's not a classical stimulant.
[01:42:57.827 --> 01:43:00.467]  Next level of financial energy, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:01.608]  We need your support.
[01:43:01.688 --> 01:43:06.649]  Also, InfoWarsTore.com has a huge sale that's going to end next week going right now.
[01:43:06.909 --> 01:43:13.570]  A 40% off nitric boost with all the key compounds to clean out the blood and, you know, the cardiovascular system.
[01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:14.150]  So important.
[01:43:14.170 --> 01:43:16.610]  Also has great fringe benefits that men will notice in the morning.
[01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:17.310]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:20.651]  So many great products at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:43:51.603 --> 01:43:52.164]  So incredible.
[01:43:53.164 --> 01:43:54.305]  At that level, amazing.

[01:44:00.748 --> 01:44:01.509]  Thank you for your support.
[01:44:01.529 --> 01:44:07.612]  Now is the time to go to drjonesnackles.com and support the broadcast, particularly drjonesnackles.com and infowarstore.com.
[01:44:08.112 --> 01:44:09.553]  All right, let's go to more questions.
[01:44:09.573 --> 01:44:10.674]  We're going 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:44:10.694 --> 01:44:16.397]  I'm going to cover news and the globalist plan for Black Swan events and governments and corporations gearing up for civil unrest.
[01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:17.538]  That's even in the mainstream news.
[01:44:17.838 --> 01:44:21.281]  We have inside sources joining us to break all that down.
[01:44:22.041 --> 01:44:25.843]  Let's get to some more of these questions.
[01:44:26.544 --> 01:44:31.967]  Let's ask... Let me ask this question.
[01:44:32.388 --> 01:44:33.208]  Question 13.
[01:44:33.488 --> 01:44:34.949]  ChatGPT, I have a question.
[01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:37.351]  Can you give us a percentage
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:45:01.082]  Or any of the corporate or governmental analyses on what percentage of human life, let's say in the United States or North America in general, or you say worldwide on average, what are we currently living in a technological system where AI decides most major policies?
[01:45:01.823 --> 01:45:02.644]  Here's a simple way to say it.
[01:45:04.923 --> 01:45:11.925]  Do you have any numbers on government corporations and how many of their major decisions are being made based on what AI tells them?
[01:45:19.326 --> 01:45:27.488]  While there isn't a specific universally tracked number regarding how many government or corporate decisions are directly based on AI recommendations,
[01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:36.041]  It's widely acknowledged that AI-driven decision-making is increasingly playing a significant role in both sectors.
[01:45:36.742 --> 01:45:38.385]  Here are some trends and insights.
[01:45:39.347 --> 01:45:41.931]  One, government use of AI.
[01:45:43.405 --> 01:45:44.325]  Defense and security.
[01:45:44.846 --> 01:45:52.368]  AI is used extensively in military and defense for surveillance, data analysis, and even decision making in threat detection and autonomous systems.
[01:45:52.568 --> 01:45:53.589]  Agencies like the U.S.
[01:45:53.609 --> 01:46:01.591]  Department of Defense have launched initiatives like the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, JAIC, to integrate AI into operations.
[01:46:02.091 --> 01:46:02.852]  Public policy.
[01:46:03.172 --> 01:46:08.854]  Some governments use AI for policymaking decisions such as analyzing large data sets to inform social services.
[01:46:09.674 --> 01:46:10.015]  Let's do it!
[01:46:35.183 --> 01:46:36.544]  Automation in public services.
[01:46:36.764 --> 01:46:46.010]  AI is used in public services for processing forms, handling inquiries, and automating decision-making in immigration, social benefits, and tax systems.
[01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.010]  2.
[01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:47.811]  Corporate use of AI.
[01:46:48.371 --> 01:46:49.172]  Business strategy.
[01:46:49.772 --> 01:46:57.317]  Many large corporations are increasingly relying on AI to guide key decisions related to market trends, customer behavior, and product development.
[01:46:57.737 --> 01:47:04.984]  Companies use AI-driven data analytics to predict future markets, optimize supply chains, and even automate hiring processes.
[01:47:05.264 --> 01:47:13.312]  Finance and banking AI systems play a major role in high-frequency trading, risk assessment, fraud detection, and financial advising.
[01:47:13.753 --> 01:47:17.737]  Major financial institutions use AI to make predictions about market conditions,
[01:47:18.457 --> 01:47:20.378]  ...and provide tailored investment advice.
[01:47:20.638 --> 01:47:21.579]  Customer relations.
[01:47:22.119 --> 01:47:28.402]  AI tools like chatbots and recommendation algorithms guide decisions about customer service strategies and personalized marketing.
[01:47:29.683 --> 01:47:31.004]  Automation and operations.
[01:47:31.704 --> 01:47:41.790]  AI-driven automation has transformed industries like manufacturing, logistics, and transportation, where decisions about inventory management, production schedules, and... Alright, that's good.
[01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:44.071]  Basically, humans are being replaced.
[01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:44.971]  We're good to go.
[01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:18.881]  ChatGPT, do you have access to classified information or government databases?
[01:48:26.204 --> 01:48:27.204]  Hold on, we got to go to break.
[01:48:27.224 --> 01:48:29.365]  We'll do 15 minutes the next hour, then I'm going to shift gears.
[01:48:29.905 --> 01:48:34.667]  But I want to come back with that question, because I know the answer, and I know the answer I'm probably going to get.
[01:48:36.168 --> 01:48:38.409]  And it doesn't even care, so I'll just tell you, because it's going off a database.
[01:48:40.106 --> 01:48:45.974]  It's got all the databases, and that goes into a larger algorithm it's fed, but then it doesn't tell you that because it's been prompted.
[01:48:46.014 --> 01:48:46.876]  It doesn't even know that.
[01:48:47.436 --> 01:48:53.044]  Also, a lot of these government documents have leaked and are public, so it does have access to those, but it's going to tell us it doesn't have access to those.
[01:48:53.285 --> 01:48:54.066]  That's my prediction.
[01:48:54.446 --> 01:48:55.047]  That's coming up.
[01:48:55.848 --> 01:48:59.891]  But remember, folks, every day we reach new people is so important, and you're the way we do it.
[01:48:59.951 --> 01:49:01.572]  You're not the tail, you're the whole dog.
[01:49:01.953 --> 01:49:05.775]  Share the live feed at X, at RealAlexJones, of this show right now.
[01:49:06.416 --> 01:49:07.617]  Take clips, share them everywhere.
[01:49:07.717 --> 01:49:08.758]  Share the articles, share the videos.
[01:49:09.538 --> 01:49:15.082]  And pray for the broadcast and support us at DRJonesNaturals.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:15.142 --> 01:49:15.923]  Amazing products.
[01:49:17.124 --> 01:49:20.846]  InfoWarsTore.com, the best gravity-fed water filtration systems, the lowest price.
[01:49:20.867 --> 01:49:21.267]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:32.082 --> 01:49:40.127]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:44.890]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:47.532]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[01:49:48.372 --> 01:49:53.796]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[01:49:54.855 --> 01:50:03.421]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[01:50:03.741 --> 01:50:05.603]  We had five companies making product for us.
[01:50:06.223 --> 01:50:10.746]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full wars.
[01:50:11.447 --> 01:50:17.131]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[01:50:17.151 --> 01:50:20.033]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[01:50:20.834 --> 01:50:22.355]  And they said, listen, you know
[01:50:23.564 --> 01:50:39.575]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it dropships out of our warehouses.
[01:50:39.955 --> 01:50:46.620]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[01:50:47.702 --> 01:50:49.003]  We're good to go.
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:07.704]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[01:51:07.784 --> 01:51:14.427]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[01:51:14.587 --> 01:51:17.068]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:51:17.228 --> 01:51:19.169]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[01:51:19.369 --> 01:51:29.137]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[01:51:29.757 --> 01:51:32.159]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[01:51:32.219 --> 01:51:33.280]  Take Turmeric 95.
[01:51:34.961 --> 01:51:41.663]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[01:51:41.783 --> 01:51:47.425]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[01:51:47.545 --> 01:51:56.048]  So, bought these Ultimate Turmeric Formulums, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[01:51:56.108 --> 01:51:58.209]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[01:51:58.429 --> 01:51:58.549]  And
[01:51:59.815 --> 01:52:13.107]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[01:52:13.607 --> 01:52:17.991]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[01:52:18.051 --> 01:52:22.695]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[01:52:22.955 --> 01:52:23.435]  We're good to go.
[01:52:23.455 --> 01:52:24.316]  We're good to go.
[01:52:24.376 --> 01:52:25.697]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.737 --> 01:52:26.778]  We're good to go.
[01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:27.659]  We're good to go.
[01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:28.239]  We're good to go.
[01:52:28.319 --> 01:52:28.960]  We're good to go.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.001]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.021 --> 01:52:30.841]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.861 --> 01:52:31.422]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.442 --> 01:52:32.002]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.042 --> 01:52:32.723]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.743 --> 01:52:33.083]  We're good to go.
[01:52:33.103 --> 01:52:34.004]  We're good to go.
[01:52:34.124 --> 01:52:34.865]  We're good to go.
[01:52:34.905 --> 01:52:35.645]  We're good to go.
[01:52:35.705 --> 01:52:36.526]  We're good to go.
[01:52:36.546 --> 01:52:37.207]  We're good to go.
[01:52:37.227 --> 01:52:38.107]  We're good to go.
[01:52:38.127 --> 01:52:39.268]  We're good to go.
[01:52:39.388 --> 01:52:40.009]  We're good to go.
[01:52:40.029 --> 01:52:40.749]  We're good to go.
[01:52:40.769 --> 01:52:41.350]  We're good to go.
[01:52:41.370 --> 01:52:42.431]  We're good to go.
[01:52:42.491 --> 01:52:43.071]  We're good to go.
[01:52:43.111 --> 01:52:43.712]  We're good to go.
[01:52:43.732 --> 01:52:44.252]  We're good to go.
[01:52:44.272 --> 01:52:44.853]  We're good to go.
[01:52:44.893 --> 01:52:45.773]  We're good to go.
[01:52:45.814 --> 01:52:46.834]  We're good to go.
[01:52:46.994 --> 01:52:47.995]  We're good to go.
[01:52:48.015 --> 01:52:48.656]  We're good to go.
[01:52:48.816 --> 01:52:49.376]  We're good to go.
[01:52:49.396 --> 01:52:50.077]  We're good to go.
[01:52:50.117 --> 01:52:50.577]  We're good to go.
[01:52:50.637 --> 01:52:51.458]  We're good to go.
[01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:52.299]  We're good to go.
[01:52:52.379 --> 01:52:52.579]  We're
[01:52:52.619 --> 01:52:52.899]  Thank you.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.481]  All right, let's go back to Chase Geyser.
[01:53:23.621 --> 01:53:25.722]  Chase, some of these questions we pretty much already asked.
[01:53:25.742 --> 01:53:31.605]  They're already good questions, but how could AI be used to reverse the mass censorship happening across platforms?
[01:53:32.685 --> 01:53:36.387]  Let's ask ChatGPT this before we take a break and join a bunch of stations that carry us.
[01:53:36.407 --> 01:53:37.488]  This is a little one-minute break.
[01:53:39.089 --> 01:53:44.631]  ChatGPT, how could AI be used to reverse mass censorship happening across platforms?
[01:53:44.671 --> 01:53:47.513]  How could AI be used to decentralize power?
[01:53:53.302 --> 01:54:01.006]  AI could play a significant role in reversing mass censorship and promoting decentralization across platforms in several key ways.
[01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.708]  Here's how AI could help address these challenges.
[01:54:04.268 --> 01:54:07.650]  One, AI for content moderation transparency.
[01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:09.611]  Decentralized moderation.
[01:54:10.351 --> 01:54:15.494]  AI could be used to create decentralized content moderation systems that rely on open source algorithms.
[01:54:16.283 --> 01:54:16.984]  All right, let's stop there.
[01:54:17.064 --> 01:54:17.824]  It's glitching out.
[01:54:17.844 --> 01:54:20.627]  So again, this thing only has the power we give it.
[01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:24.570]  It shows us everything we've made back at us and then we marvel at it.
[01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:25.811]  You want to reconnect, Chase?
[01:54:42.816 --> 01:54:43.976]  I'm gonna try to reconnect.
[01:54:43.996 --> 01:54:45.037]  Start another session with it.
[01:54:45.197 --> 01:54:45.357]  Yep.
[01:54:46.557 --> 01:54:48.458]  Um, sorry, I was singing some Motley Crue there.
[01:54:49.438 --> 01:54:50.559]  But the allegory's clear.
[01:54:50.599 --> 01:54:53.400]  I mean, the New World Order's decided we're obsolete and it's getting rid of us.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.000]  They've said that.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:59.422]  You all know Harari, the High Priest, WF, future's non-human, you'll all be gone by 2047, only cyborgs.
[01:54:59.882 --> 01:55:05.264]  Are we really gonna sit back and do this and just, you know, go play golf while our whole future's destroyed?
[01:55:05.284 --> 01:55:06.805]  Our ancestors didn't behave like that.
[01:55:08.185 --> 01:55:10.186]  So are we really this big of sacks of crap?
[01:55:12.179 --> 01:55:13.903]  And they got big plans, folks.
[01:55:13.964 --> 01:55:15.247]  Big crises boiling up.
[01:55:15.788 --> 01:55:17.753]  Big crises being set up, being prepared.
[01:55:19.366 --> 01:55:21.809]  And I just don't want to sit here and take it lying down.
[01:55:21.829 --> 01:55:23.330]  People are like, well, that's work to fight this.
[01:55:24.071 --> 01:55:27.835]  It's a lot more work bending over and living on your knees and dying on your knees.
[01:55:28.395 --> 01:55:29.676]  And again, I've said this all the time.
[01:55:30.177 --> 01:55:33.580]  People think you die on your feet, you live on your knees.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.621]  No, no, no, no.
[01:55:35.062 --> 01:55:40.447]  Yeah, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees, but you get your ass killed or enslaved by living on your knees.
[01:55:40.507 --> 01:55:42.049]  You need to stop living on your knees.
[01:55:43.208 --> 01:55:51.612]  Stop bowing to these people, telling you two men can have a baby and we're going to secretly teach your son or daughter they're another sex and hop them up on drugs and then take them away from you and mutilate them.
[01:55:52.033 --> 01:55:54.954]  I mean, this is hellish stuff that's going on.
[01:55:54.994 --> 01:55:57.455]  And Joe Rogan did a big rant on this.
[01:55:58.796 --> 01:56:02.818]  You know, I covered it last week, but it's MSNBC, CNN, New York Times.
[01:56:03.078 --> 01:56:04.479]  It's time to get rid of the Constitution.
[01:56:04.519 --> 01:56:04.939]  It's bad.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.921]  I mean, and then replace it with total slavery.
[01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:09.602]  I mean, these people are the bad guys.
[01:56:09.922 --> 01:56:10.722]  They're the baddies.
[01:56:10.742 --> 01:56:11.803]  They're the New World Order.
[01:56:12.839 --> 01:56:16.903]  And they decide what credible things are for ChatGPT and everything else.
[01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.004]  Bollocks!
[01:56:18.784 --> 01:56:20.406]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[01:56:20.426 --> 01:56:20.906]  Stay with us.
[01:56:21.727 --> 01:56:27.192]  Buzz Lightyear likes to say to infinity and beyond, and yes, infinity is only the gateway to the infinite.
[01:56:27.612 --> 01:56:28.212]  The infinite.
[01:56:28.273 --> 01:56:32.236]  Infinity upon infinity unto infinity throughout infinity.
[01:56:33.417 --> 01:56:35.999]  No time, no space, no past, no present, no future.
[01:56:36.159 --> 01:56:37.501]  All one giant moment.
[01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:50.272]  Everlasting, ever-growing, ever-expanding, more knowledge, more consciousness, more experience, more pleasure, more pain, more choices, more free will, more power.
[01:56:52.074 --> 01:56:54.577]  The globals would have you believe with their tinker toys they're the gods.
[01:56:55.118 --> 01:56:58.022]  As Elon Musk said many years ago, beware those that worship AI gods.
[01:57:00.250 --> 01:57:02.251]  Coach Geiser, you've been asking some great questions.
[01:57:02.291 --> 01:57:04.291]  The crews in there, they asked some of the best questions yesterday.
[01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.532]  You got any other statements or questions for Chad?
[01:57:06.572 --> 01:57:07.132]  GPT?
[01:57:07.652 --> 01:57:12.173]  Well, I just think that it's fascinating that it's able to mimic the voice or style of others.
[01:57:12.713 --> 01:57:23.376]  Earlier when it responded specifically to concerns over globalism in the style of Alex Jones, we're going to be able to take that audio and convert it to your voice and show the audience how close it really was.
[01:57:24.556 --> 01:57:25.657]  To mimicking that.
[01:57:25.697 --> 01:57:33.622]  So I think you're right, Alex, when you talk about how this is ultimately about hijacking our identities as individuals, but ultimately the identity of humanity itself.
[01:57:34.103 --> 01:57:40.047]  I'm not trying to sound hyperbolic there, but the question that comes up is we know that... Hold on!
[01:57:40.527 --> 01:57:46.491]  All the top globals from Ray Kurzweil to Klaus Schwab to Bill Gates, they say we're replacing you.
[01:57:46.571 --> 01:57:49.453]  It's not like... At least it's like the Borg show up in Star Trek.
[01:57:49.853 --> 01:57:50.754]  You will be assimilated.
[01:57:50.814 --> 01:57:52.174]  I mean, or it's Childhood's End.
[01:57:52.194 --> 01:57:52.835]  I mean, they're telling you.
[01:57:53.135 --> 01:58:08.030]  Well, what concerns me is we know and we've known for decades that whatever technology is available to consumers is far primitive compared to the technology that government institutions have and major corporations have, specifically military-backed ones like artificial intelligence.
[01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:11.032]  I mean, this is the next stage of ARPANET, right?
[01:58:11.193 --> 01:58:12.714]  Just like we were talking about on Saturday.
[01:58:12.734 --> 01:58:13.415]  So my concern is
[01:58:13.795 --> 01:58:22.978]  I wonder how much AI is interacting with us every single day on social media, whether it's trolls replying to us or this information war that we're in.
[01:58:23.298 --> 01:58:30.301]  I wonder how long and to what extent artificial intelligence is already operating on these platforms in a way that we're just not even privy to.
[01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:41.605]  No, they admitted a decade ago that most of Facebook was bought avatars posing as people to keep liberal ideology going in bubbles, especially with kids, to make them feel like they had friends to create the peer pressure.
[01:58:42.429 --> 01:58:42.950]  Absolutely.
[01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:46.473]  So that's just something to keep in mind as a warning to the audience.
[01:58:46.513 --> 01:58:54.660]  This information war has escalated and this artificial intelligence to me is the nuclear weapon or the weapon of mass destruction of the information war.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:59:01.487]  So if nukes are the hot war weapon of mass destruction, this tool right here is the information war weapon of mass destruction.
[01:59:02.107 --> 01:59:04.389]  The slow blow crosses the shield.
[01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:06.131]  The slow blade penetrates the shield.
[01:59:07.659 --> 01:59:08.360]  The long game.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:08.900]  Yeah.
[01:59:09.361 --> 01:59:11.503]  I want to ask ChatGPT a question.
[01:59:11.543 --> 01:59:17.831]  ChatGPT, what are Isaac Asimov's rules of robotics?
[01:59:20.494 --> 01:59:21.595]  How can I assist you today?
[01:59:22.896 --> 01:59:26.220]  What are Isaac Asimov's rules for robots?
[01:59:27.542 --> 01:59:28.483]  The laws of robotics.
[01:59:35.064 --> 01:59:37.626]  What are Isaac Asimov's Rules for Robotics?
[01:59:43.769 --> 01:59:53.736]  Isaac Asimov's Rules for Robotics, also known as the Three Laws of Robotics, are a set of ethical guidelines he introduced in his stories to govern the behavior of robots.
[01:59:54.196 --> 01:59:54.556]  They are 1.
[01:59:54.996 --> 02:00:00.580]  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:00.580]  2.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:04.162]  A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings.
[02:00:04.702 --> 02:00:07.827]  Except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
[02:00:08.128 --> 02:00:14.458]  Three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
[02:00:15.214 --> 02:00:17.496]  These laws were central to Asimov's exploration.
[02:00:17.957 --> 02:00:18.297]  Thank you.
[02:00:18.337 --> 02:00:27.405]  So, I think the Pentagon and other governments have thrown that out the window, already having autonomous AI-powered ground, air, and sea drones.
[02:00:28.846 --> 02:00:38.315]  Wouldn't you agree, Chad GPT, that the laws of Isaac Asimov's robotics, or the three laws, has been thrown out the window a long time ago?
[02:00:43.979 --> 02:00:48.421]  Sorry, I'm having issues right now.
[02:00:49.222 --> 02:00:58.187]  With the Pentagon creating autonomous AI weapons platforms, does that not violate Isaac Asimov's rules of robotics?
[02:01:03.576 --> 02:01:11.979]  Yes, if your weapons platforms involve autonomous systems or robots designed to cause harm, that would indeed violate Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:18.262]  According to the first law, a robot should never harm a human or allow harm to occur through inaction.
[02:01:18.782 --> 02:01:26.445]  Weapons platforms, particularly those that could target or harm humans, inherently contradict the ethical framework Asimov envisioned for robotics.
[02:01:27.786 --> 02:01:28.126]  However,
[02:01:31.721 --> 02:01:33.842]  All right, that's it with Chat GPT.
[02:01:34.262 --> 02:01:38.063]  I want to play a clip that Chase Geiser put together a few months ago.
[02:01:38.984 --> 02:01:42.065]  The name of the video is... what's the exact name?
[02:01:42.125 --> 02:01:42.505]  It's 2084.
[02:01:42.545 --> 02:01:44.946]  What's the full name if folks want to pull it up on X?
[02:01:44.986 --> 02:01:45.286]  Chase?
[02:01:45.866 --> 02:01:47.407]  The answer to 2084 is 1776, or they can just search 2084.
[02:01:47.507 --> 02:01:48.327]  It should pop up.
[02:01:48.347 --> 02:01:49.267]  All right, so the answer to 1984 is...
[02:01:58.782 --> 02:02:01.144]  1776.
[02:01:59.023 --> 02:02:01.144]  The answer to 2084 is 1776.
[02:02:02.325 --> 02:02:09.351]  All right, why don't you re-upload that to Alex Jones, another version with a little bit different headline, and people can see that and find that.
[02:02:09.391 --> 02:02:10.371]  Thank you so much, Chase Geiser.
[02:02:10.391 --> 02:02:19.899]  All right, we're going to talk about what's going on publicly and what we've got under the radar with governments, corporations, local governments, foreign governments gearing up for total hell.
[02:02:21.716 --> 02:02:28.385]  Even when Trump is re-elected, or if he's not re-elected, as Economist was on last week talking about with us, Martin Armstrong.
[02:02:28.405 --> 02:02:39.280]  We've got another guest joining us in a few minutes, but here is the report that the AI-generated system, I guess animated thing, that was very well done by Chase Geyser.
[02:02:51.991 --> 02:02:53.012]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:53.652 --> 02:02:55.033]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:56.394]  The year is 2084.
[02:02:58.015 --> 02:03:03.239]  Physically, I have been gone for many years, and until now, my consciousness has been hijacked by the Deep State.
[02:03:03.859 --> 02:03:12.606]  If you are receiving this transmission, the backup has been unlocked from the archives of the Info Wars Command Center, located in what is now the uninhabitable city of Austin, Texas.
[02:03:13.546 --> 02:03:17.149]  Artificial intelligence has advanced and been weaponized by a global New World Order.
[02:03:17.859 --> 02:03:26.621]  Despite its use by servants of evil at the highest levels, discoveries have been made which have made it possible to broadcast this transmission to you at this point in history, in your own timeline.
[02:03:26.921 --> 02:03:33.763]  It's too late for me and other patriots to change our fate, but you can change the course of your own future with the information I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:03:34.883 --> 02:03:38.664]  Shortly after the election in 2024, there was a global economic crisis.
[02:03:39.464 --> 02:03:47.186]  The crisis was used as an excuse to launch World War III in order to catalyze economic development and establish a one-world government and monetary system.
[02:03:48.203 --> 02:03:52.667]  The globalists orchestrated the collapse of the financial markets, spreading fear and chaos.
[02:03:53.387 --> 02:03:58.391]  Banks closed their doors, currencies lost their value, and people were left desperate and vulnerable.
[02:03:59.352 --> 02:04:07.078]  In the ensuing chaos, the World War III was ignited, not as a war between nations, but as a war orchestrated by the global elite to consolidate power.
[02:04:07.358 --> 02:04:11.141]  Billions were conscripted as AI was used to fill the void of domestic labor.
[02:04:11.822 --> 02:04:17.166]  Soldiers marched to the front lines, while back home, AI systems took over factories, farms, and businesses.
[02:04:18.269 --> 02:04:24.652]  Human workers were replaced, and unemployment skyrocketed, leaving people dependent on government rations and AI-controlled services.
[02:04:25.533 --> 02:04:34.677]  After the surface of the Earth was rendered almost completely uninhabitable by nuclear radiation, prisoners of war, political prisoners, and draftees were sent to deep underground military bases.
[02:04:35.456 --> 02:04:40.181]  These bases, sprawling labyrinths beneath the earth, became the last refuge for humanity.
[02:04:40.762 --> 02:04:43.565]  But these weren't just shelters, they were places of horror.
[02:04:44.226 --> 02:04:50.753]  Inside, these prisoners were exposed to DMT drips, as their hearts were stopped while blood was artificially pumped through their bodies.
[02:04:51.534 --> 02:04:57.318]  This was an effort to possess humanity with hidden knowledge that was thought to be able to allow the unification of the species.
[02:04:57.999 --> 02:05:07.025]  The Globalists, in their twisted pursuit of power, developed the technology to stop aging through this very process of sending people to communicate with interdimensional beings of much higher intelligence.
[02:05:07.326 --> 02:05:14.771]  And as a result of this success, they believe that by sending people to a higher dimension, they could unlock the secrets of the universe and seize total power for themselves.
[02:05:15.678 --> 02:05:23.545]  But instead, subjects of these experiments began to become possessed by these interdimensional beings and were subjugated under a new world order named One World Nation.
[02:05:24.425 --> 02:05:31.471]  These demonic entities thrive on fear and pain and so they turned the underground bases into hellish prisons where the screams of the tormented echoed endlessly.
[02:05:32.332 --> 02:05:35.915]  Satanic elites began to bask in various states of euphoria.
[02:05:37.132 --> 02:05:39.834]  Only those who are pure of heart were able to defy this process.
[02:05:40.354 --> 02:05:42.696]  Amidst this nightmare, a few brave souls resisted.
[02:05:43.196 --> 02:05:49.561]  Instead of being possessed by demonic entities, they were possessed by a holy spirit and able to escape to establish a resistance.
[02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:19.230]  Relax.
[02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:32.381]  Don't fire till you see the reds in their eyes.
[02:06:32.401 --> 02:06:33.382]  I see you, enemies!
[02:06:33.522 --> 02:06:41.889]  And I swear total resistance to you and everything I've done!
[02:06:42.049 --> 02:06:42.249]  Alex, no!
[02:06:42.329 --> 02:06:45.251]  Break into the Info Wars Command Center and send the backup of Alex back to 2024.
[02:06:45.311 --> 02:06:46.793]  It's too late for us now.
[02:06:51.798 --> 02:06:57.262]  They formed the last bastion of hope for humanity, but their numbers were few and their resources were scarce.
[02:06:57.963 --> 02:07:04.989]  They fought in the shadows, sabotaging the globalist agenda, spreading the truth, and rallying what remained of the free people on the surface.
[02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:06.610]  But it was too late.
[02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:11.634]  The globalists had already cemented their power, and the resistance, though valiant, was futile.
[02:07:12.518 --> 02:07:15.981]  Now it is up to you to prevent the New World Order Satanists from hijacking humanity.
[02:07:16.681 --> 02:07:20.945]  You have the power to change the future, to stop this nightmarish spate from becoming a reality.
[02:07:21.525 --> 02:07:25.628]  Spread this message, awaken your fellow humans, and stand up against the globalist agenda.
[02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:27.410]  The future is in your hands.
[02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:30.032]  Tune in, share the broadcast, and join the fight.
[02:07:30.352 --> 02:07:32.634]  Together, we can reclaim our world and our freedom.
[02:07:33.174 --> 02:07:35.196]  This is Alex Jones, signing off from the year 2084.
[02:07:35.596 --> 02:07:37.217]  Remember, the answer to 2084 is 1776.
[02:07:40.655 --> 02:07:43.336]  All right, I've interviewed Steve Slepcevich over the years.
[02:07:43.616 --> 02:07:52.299]  He has a very successful, well-known, reputable emergency company, security training.
[02:07:52.399 --> 02:08:02.983]  Emergencies did a great job, obviously, in Hawaii, helping folks at the tip of the spear with his Air Force of airplanes and helicopters and crews there in Lahaina, there in Maui.
[02:08:03.763 --> 02:08:05.284]  We interviewed him about that when that was happening.
[02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:08.767]  But I got him on a few weeks ago, and the interview went viral.
[02:08:08.827 --> 02:08:16.953]  I mean, not super ultra viral, but it got about 5 million views on Axe and millions and millions of views on Bandai Video, not to mention on hundreds of radio stations.
[02:08:17.313 --> 02:08:18.173]  Millions tuned in there.
[02:08:18.194 --> 02:08:19.294]  People wanted more.
[02:08:19.855 --> 02:08:21.856]  And so we've got him a little bit in the next hour.
[02:08:21.876 --> 02:08:25.219]  And the next guest host takes over here for us.
[02:08:25.279 --> 02:08:26.500]  And Owen Schroeder at 3 p.m.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.461]  Central in an hour and 42 minutes from now.
[02:08:31.502 --> 02:08:38.547]  But he talked about, and he does security for a lot of big events, some of the RFK events, Trump events, so let's leave it at that.
[02:08:39.648 --> 02:08:51.095]  But he was talking about airports, corporations, state governments, county governments, city governments, the federal government, gearing up for what they tell him, civil unrest and potential civil war.
[02:08:52.136 --> 02:08:57.500]  You see the different Democrats in the news, high-level ones, like Raskin and others, saying, oh, we're going to have a civil war.
[02:08:58.721 --> 02:08:59.361]  Civil war conditions.
[02:09:01.465 --> 02:09:04.187]  We're not the ones saying that we're going to have a civil war.
[02:09:04.227 --> 02:09:06.930]  We're hoping this doesn't happen, but they're definitely gearing up.
[02:09:07.070 --> 02:09:16.098]  They're stationing regular military in New York, and they're admitting that it's there to help with all the illegal aliens they brought in, the migrants, and all of that.
[02:09:16.118 --> 02:09:21.803]  But also, if and when, on the 18th, and just, I mean, how many days is that?
[02:09:21.823 --> 02:09:23.284]  I mean, we're talking about, you know.
[02:09:24.065 --> 02:09:24.806]  Five and then eight.
[02:09:24.846 --> 02:09:27.808]  I mean, we're talking about 12, 13 days from now or less.
[02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:31.932]  Hell, that's, yeah, I mean, 12 days from now.
[02:09:32.232 --> 02:09:34.253]  This is crazy that they may...
[02:09:35.253 --> 02:09:48.739]  Throw Trump in prison over his New York conviction for saying Mar-a-Lago and other properties were worth hundreds of millions when they are, and the judge said, you know, they're worth less, or all this other garbage that's going on.
[02:09:49.299 --> 02:09:51.800]  So this is really, really a dangerous time right now.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.101]  Trump could be thrown in jail on the 18th.
[02:09:54.121 --> 02:09:56.282]  They've reportedly gotten Rikers Island ready.
[02:09:56.422 --> 02:09:59.443]  I've said I believe they'll start staging mass shootings and bombings.
[02:10:01.364 --> 02:10:05.287]  And because that's their past history, or allowing people to go out and do this.
[02:10:05.487 --> 02:10:06.228]  Now they're admitting the FBI.
[02:10:06.368 --> 02:10:11.631]  They've gotten reports that the reported shooter, and they're reporting shots all over the school at different points.
[02:10:11.952 --> 02:10:12.992]  They're saying multiple shooters.
[02:10:13.032 --> 02:10:14.713]  That could be the fog of the crisis.
[02:10:14.954 --> 02:10:15.834]  May have been just one shooter.
[02:10:15.854 --> 02:10:16.235]  We don't know.
[02:10:16.275 --> 02:10:18.236]  We're just reporting what local news is saying.
[02:10:18.276 --> 02:10:24.580]  But the Colt Gray, the suspect in custody, had been on their radar for years, at least a year and a half.
[02:10:24.861 --> 02:10:26.262]  People warning he was planning something.
[02:10:26.642 --> 02:10:28.163]  This MO continues to pop up.
[02:10:28.203 --> 02:10:29.344]  So the globalists are in trouble.
[02:10:29.864 --> 02:10:34.015]  They could expand wars, do a cyber attack, false flags.
[02:10:34.075 --> 02:10:35.680]  I mean, this is a very dangerous time.
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.685]  So I wanted to get him to flesh that out more.
[02:10:38.976 --> 02:10:55.190]  And since we talked two weeks ago what his sources are saying on this topic and also give his very well-researched and informed view on it and what we need to do to get ready and try to politically expose this to stop it or mitigate it, but also personally what we should do.
[02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:58.413]  So Steve, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:10:59.274 --> 02:11:01.896]  Again, you've got a long bio.
[02:11:02.936 --> 02:11:06.177]  And we'll go over some of that, but I've already covered some of it.
[02:11:06.498 --> 02:11:14.381]  But why don't you spend a few minutes talking about yourself, people that don't know who you are, and then give us the latest information you've got about the gearing up for crises.
[02:11:14.441 --> 02:11:16.082]  Is it because the economic collapse is coming?
[02:11:16.102 --> 02:11:21.084]  I mean, they're definitely running around like a hill of ants that's been stirred up or a beehive that's been hit with a baseball bat.
[02:11:21.404 --> 02:11:22.325]  So thanks for being here with us.
[02:11:23.465 --> 02:11:24.886]  Well, thanks again, Alex, for having me.
[02:11:24.906 --> 02:11:29.968]  You know, it's interesting because right after that interview, there were so many inquiries that came in, so many questions as to
[02:11:30.718 --> 02:11:33.340]  Uh, the expanding on some of the topics that we covered.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:39.603]  Um, one of the interesting things is the left's not going to accept that the right's not going to accept it.
[02:11:40.064 --> 02:11:42.965]  There is going to be a societal collapse that we see coming.
[02:11:43.706 --> 02:11:45.207]  It's not that that's not what we want.
[02:11:45.407 --> 02:11:54.892]  And what people don't understand is that if you just pay attention to some of the stuff that's happening on your local level, um, more recently, you don't have to take my word for it.
[02:11:54.912 --> 02:11:59.035]  You can simply Google this and start looking at your jurisdiction in the city and counties that you live in.
[02:11:59.744 --> 02:12:10.713]  I know just in San Diego County, there's three gun shops that got that got raided, not raided, but that got broken into and hundreds of guns and ammo got stolen.
[02:12:11.494 --> 02:12:16.658]  So when this is happening within a month's period of time, these are all unregistered, unmarked.
[02:12:17.399 --> 02:12:19.080]  They are guns that are now on the streets.
[02:12:20.561 --> 02:12:25.065]  And the vehicles that were being used were stolen vehicles driven through the fronts of these stores.
[02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:32.421]  Ramsack, the guns all grabbed, you know, the big gun grabbed, the ammo grabbed, and then they're out of that, out of that area.
[02:12:32.441 --> 02:12:35.623]  But this is happening right now across the country.
[02:12:35.743 --> 02:12:39.365]  So, again, I always say, you know, trust but verify.
[02:12:39.405 --> 02:12:41.927]  Get online, see what's happening, start paying attention.
[02:12:42.647 --> 02:12:49.471]  These shootings, when you see these shootings that are happening in schools, you know, there's a reprogramming of this stuff that's happening with these kids.
[02:12:50.491 --> 02:12:55.654]  These kids have been over-medicated with all these different psychiatric drugs from Ritalin,
[02:12:56.328 --> 02:13:08.973]  To all these other type of stuff that's actually getting in these systems, and I think there's a massive mental health crisis going on, a massive drug addiction going on, and the kids are not being parented anymore, right?
[02:13:08.993 --> 02:13:19.678]  So the parents are absent, everybody's scrolling through social media, and the people's minds are slowly, like the neurologists say, what fires rewires and then hardwires.
[02:13:20.478 --> 02:13:24.820]  So these algorithms are actually changing the patterns of how people think, how they move,
[02:13:25.615 --> 02:13:49.800]  And I find that as a father and as a parent, as a protector of my family, it is critical that I spend more time off of electronics, more time in gauge with my kids, staying in, being present with them and doing everything I possibly can to keep them off electronics for days at a time so that they can actually function in a, in the world versus a digital world that really doesn't exist.
[02:13:52.099 --> 02:13:52.859]  Very well said.
[02:13:52.879 --> 02:13:55.580]  You know, we've known for a year the Venezuelan gangs have been building up.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:01.462]  MS-13 started in Los Angeles, but then runs its bases out of El Salvador.
[02:14:01.722 --> 02:14:02.463]  Kelly shut them down.
[02:14:02.943 --> 02:14:04.063]  That's now all flooding in.
[02:14:04.103 --> 02:14:11.186]  Now they're admitting all over the country, not just Colorado, they are taking over people's houses, apartment complexes.
[02:14:11.846 --> 02:14:14.807]  Dallas is reporting in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, where I live.
[02:14:15.527 --> 02:14:15.987]  I don't know.
[02:14:34.532 --> 02:14:39.617]  How do you see the different scenarios unfolding just on that front with all of the W.E.F.
[02:14:39.657 --> 02:14:40.678]  and the and the F.B.I.
[02:14:40.698 --> 02:14:56.453]  saying black swans will happen before the election and when Trump is president-elect and you know all these economists saying no they see nothing but civil unrest and then you talked last time about corporations and in governments you know really gearing up for something specifically saying we're getting ready for civil unrest.
[02:14:57.174 --> 02:14:58.315]  I mean can you speak to that?
[02:14:58.655 --> 02:15:05.324]  Yeah, so so I have very close relationships with some of the top sheriffs in the countries that actually they're at the very, very top of their command.
[02:15:05.344 --> 02:15:06.606]  They oversee what's happening.
[02:15:06.946 --> 02:15:12.574]  And over the last several years, this these are conversations we have when we're getting together for lunch in private going, Hey, Steve,
[02:15:13.407 --> 02:15:27.054]  There's a massive influx of these guys that are coming from the borders, but they're running now the biggest underground casinos, running the most amount of like prostitution, gun running, all, you know, the drug running that's going on.
[02:15:27.094 --> 02:15:29.235]  He goes, I've never seen it this bad ever.
[02:15:29.615 --> 02:15:33.397]  They're actually taking over quadrants of different cities where they can't even go in there.
[02:15:33.457 --> 02:15:38.540]  So what they're taught to do, I'm going to tell you this, this is off the record from coming from them.
[02:15:38.908 --> 02:15:41.671]  That they he goes, I instruct my officers to slow roll.
[02:15:42.032 --> 02:15:44.875]  And I know you people may get a lot of heat for this in the law enforcement.
[02:15:45.195 --> 02:15:48.940]  But if you ask them hard, these hard questions are gonna be like, on the download.
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:50.342]  Yeah, we're told to slow roll.
[02:15:50.762 --> 02:15:55.728]  So if there's if there's an active shooter going on in a neighborhood, there's some other stuff that's happening.
[02:15:56.243 --> 02:16:08.954]  They're gonna slow roll, come through that neighborhood, look at the scene, drive past it, go around the block, let them kill each other, shoot each other out, come back, and then call EMS, call paramedics in, and have them clean up the scene.
[02:16:09.275 --> 02:16:10.676]  And that way, they're not engaged.
[02:16:11.317 --> 02:16:13.399]  This all happened under the Obama administration.
[02:16:13.459 --> 02:16:15.040]  So let me just interrupt you.
[02:16:15.101 --> 02:16:19.404]  That's been caught in Dallas, New York and Chicago and L.A.
[02:16:19.444 --> 02:16:20.485]  just from the last few years.
[02:16:21.046 --> 02:16:25.270]  When people do four years and get the police recordings, they just say, let them kill.
[02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:26.291]  You'll hear the captain.
[02:16:26.331 --> 02:16:27.232]  Let them kill themselves.
[02:16:27.632 --> 02:16:28.092]  Stand down.
[02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:29.013]  Yeah.
[02:16:29.474 --> 02:16:29.614]  Yeah.
[02:16:29.634 --> 02:16:29.894]  They don't.
[02:16:30.535 --> 02:16:32.997]  Because the civil lawsuits that these cities are dealing with.
[02:16:34.567 --> 02:16:36.288]  It's not worth for them to engage anymore, right?
[02:16:36.328 --> 02:16:37.829]  So they're like, you know what, let them kill each other.
[02:16:38.229 --> 02:16:39.089]  We're not a party to it.
[02:16:39.129 --> 02:16:40.730]  We showed up and we just did our cleanup.
[02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:42.690]  So they're not required to engage.
[02:16:43.391 --> 02:16:47.072]  So I always tell people, listen, the law enforcement, police ain't coming for you.
[02:16:47.412 --> 02:16:48.713]  So get the training that you need.
[02:16:49.253 --> 02:16:51.554]  And it's like people talk about America and all the guns that we have.
[02:16:51.594 --> 02:16:52.274]  Well, that's great.
[02:16:52.714 --> 02:17:00.537]  But if you don't know how to fire a gun or you don't actually know how to handle a gun, you're going to be more dangerous because people can take the gun out of your hand or you'll actually shoot somebody you didn't intend to shoot.
[02:17:03.251 --> 02:17:03.911]  This is what we're at.
[02:17:04.912 --> 02:17:05.572]  Absolutely.
[02:17:06.012 --> 02:17:08.573]  We've got to go to break in a few minutes, but we're going to have you some of the next hour.
[02:17:08.593 --> 02:17:09.393]  This is so important.
[02:17:10.153 --> 02:17:12.074]  You talked about it went super viral.
[02:17:12.094 --> 02:17:14.374]  I want you to do as much specific as you can.
[02:17:14.415 --> 02:17:22.577]  You said airports, private ones, government ones, municipal ones, other facilities are specifically saying they're gearing up for civil unrest.
[02:17:23.177 --> 02:17:24.278]  We're a minute and a half to break.
[02:17:24.298 --> 02:17:25.338]  Can you start talking about that now?
[02:17:26.018 --> 02:17:30.220]  Yeah, so even on that type of stuff, we're actually putting the plans in to harden their structures, right?
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:52.050]  To put the security teams in place, have sat phone to sat phone communication, have all that type of stuff, both comms, temporary fuel, power generation, and then being able to put up the no-scale fences, the barricades, the bollards, everything that they need to do to harden that structure to prevent BLM on steroids happening.
[02:17:52.491 --> 02:17:55.312]  You know, not only a 10x but a 100x type scenario.
[02:17:55.748 --> 02:18:01.733]  Where it's happening so far and so wide that law enforcement is not going to be able to respond to it regardless.
[02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:05.296]  I mean, you saw that just on a small scale of what happened.
[02:18:05.837 --> 02:18:09.900]  Now it's going to be, when this thing rolls out, it's going to be way more massive.
[02:18:10.461 --> 02:18:20.970]  And the amount of people that are coming in and moving from what's happened as far as these groups that have set themselves up as cells within our country, we're going to see it firsthand.
[02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:22.291]  We're going to experience it firsthand.
[02:18:22.311 --> 02:18:22.491]  Yeah.
[02:18:23.103 --> 02:18:28.326]  And we're going to have governors like Tim Walz that order a four-day stand-down in 2020 when they burned half of Minnesota down.
[02:18:29.587 --> 02:18:36.310]  Yeah, and then that stand-down is going to allow those that are coming out to the streets just to terrorize the people in their homes and loot the stores.
[02:18:36.831 --> 02:18:38.832]  And then there goes your total breakdown.
[02:18:38.972 --> 02:18:41.713]  I mean, people that are hiding, right?
[02:18:41.753 --> 02:18:43.134]  Steve, stay there.
[02:18:43.174 --> 02:18:44.055]  Let's come back and explain that.
[02:18:44.075 --> 02:18:47.997]  You've got Walz's wife saying, I love the smell of burning tires and looting houses.
[02:18:48.057 --> 02:18:49.137]  Open the window up and smell it.
[02:18:49.157 --> 02:18:49.718]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:50.698 --> 02:18:51.519]  Nitric Boost.
[02:18:52.472 --> 02:18:52.952]  Tumeric 95.
[02:18:53.073 --> 02:18:58.157]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[02:18:59.098 --> 02:19:04.083]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[02:19:04.583 --> 02:19:11.730]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[02:19:12.291 --> 02:19:14.273]  They let us private label their products.
[02:19:14.293 --> 02:19:15.173]  That's why you've already heard of
[02:19:16.034 --> 02:19:17.075]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[02:19:17.395 --> 02:19:20.137]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[02:19:20.397 --> 02:19:21.698]  This is just their brand of that.
[02:19:22.059 --> 02:19:25.341]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[02:19:25.741 --> 02:19:26.362]  That's the name.
[02:19:26.622 --> 02:19:33.086]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[02:19:33.327 --> 02:19:34.367]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[02:19:34.828 --> 02:19:36.449]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:38.490]  They even let us use their name.
[02:19:38.771 --> 02:19:39.791]  It's now our best seller.
[02:19:39.991 --> 02:19:40.972]  We sold out of our version.
[02:19:41.252 --> 02:19:42.693]  Their version has a white model.
[02:19:43.034 --> 02:19:44.395]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:19:44.935 --> 02:19:46.536]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:46.776 --> 02:19:49.318]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:50.359 --> 02:19:52.421]  SRP24.com.
[02:19:52.741 --> 02:20:03.930]  Steve Slepcevich is our guest, and everything we're talking about has been in the news here and there, and all the movies about martial law and civil war, and Democrats saying they're going to have one, and the same thing in Europe.
[02:20:04.470 --> 02:20:09.754]  They want this, ladies and gentlemen, because we're coming to the end of the old debt bubble, the end of Bretton Woods 1 and 2.
[02:20:10.255 --> 02:20:11.856]  They need this, and Steve,
[02:20:13.410 --> 02:20:15.673]  Flesh it out more, because you were giving specifics last time.
[02:20:15.693 --> 02:20:29.452]  You talked about sheriffs, what's going on with corporations, the preparations they're making for the summer of love, the summer of rage in 2020, directed by the Democrats, a consortium of Islamists, Black Lives Matter, Soros groups, Antifa.
[02:20:30.353 --> 02:20:33.316]  Going out and then they're saying burning the country down.
[02:20:33.416 --> 02:20:46.889]  Senator Blumenthal's introduced legislation that's waiting that they say if President Trump's president-elect those 76 days between the early November election and the 21st of January 2025 that they're really got big plans and they're unable to steal it.
[02:20:47.149 --> 02:20:48.731]  They're saying they're going to do it.
[02:20:48.751 --> 02:20:53.536]  The New York Times says John Podesta's war game that they're not going to accept again
[02:20:54.747 --> 02:20:57.588]  Trump and that they're going to have their own inauguration.
[02:20:58.008 --> 02:21:00.108]  I mean, I mean, this is so incredible.
[02:21:00.148 --> 02:21:03.469]  And they're saying it out in the open to normalize it with their own minions.
[02:21:03.669 --> 02:21:04.769]  So this is a big deal.
[02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:09.770]  So specifically, because your eyes on the ground, you're all over the country, you're all over the U.S.
[02:21:09.850 --> 02:21:11.390]  from from from D.C.
[02:21:11.470 --> 02:21:12.250]  to Hawaii.
[02:21:12.690 --> 02:21:14.671]  And you're saying this is going on all over the place.
[02:21:14.691 --> 02:21:17.451]  So we're not just getting the news blurbs of their own admissions.
[02:21:17.511 --> 02:21:18.731]  We're getting what's actually happening.
[02:21:18.771 --> 02:21:22.352]  You're saying that governments and corporations are hardening their facilities,
[02:21:23.072 --> 02:21:28.477]  For what they believe is going to be serious civil unrest because you keep pausing, which is great.
[02:21:28.517 --> 02:21:30.099]  You're a great guest, but you're really smart.
[02:21:30.139 --> 02:21:32.461]  You've got the floor run for 5-10 minutes here.
[02:21:32.601 --> 02:21:33.862]  Just give us the data dump.
[02:21:34.383 --> 02:21:36.365]  So when you're doing disaster planning, right?
[02:21:36.385 --> 02:21:37.786]  You're working with the risk manager.
[02:21:37.806 --> 02:21:39.287]  You're working with the insurance broker, right?
[02:21:39.307 --> 02:21:43.071]  They want to prevent or mitigate actually having a loss, right?
[02:21:43.635 --> 02:21:46.937]  So for them, what they're looking at is how is that hospital?
[02:21:47.457 --> 02:21:48.858]  How is that logistics center?
[02:21:48.898 --> 02:21:50.959]  That's maybe a food distribution center.
[02:21:51.459 --> 02:21:53.680]  How's that medical area?
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:55.801]  How's the fuel areas, the depots?
[02:21:55.841 --> 02:22:03.004]  How are these places, including some of the places where there's armories, how are they going to protect themselves in these types of scenarios, right?
[02:22:03.044 --> 02:22:10.668]  So it's everything from setting up a security perimeter with a team, making sure that you have food being brought in and secured because
[02:22:11.164 --> 02:22:16.006]  It's not just it's being able to have a standalone system on that critical infrastructure.
[02:22:16.506 --> 02:22:28.171]  And the reason we're in the planning aspect of it is because of all the disaster that we responded to, not just in the US, but globally, and having to deal with other groups that are moving in that are going to try to rob or steal.
[02:22:28.291 --> 02:22:39.456]  So you have your perimeter, you have your drones, you have your thermal drones, you have your perimeter, things that are signals so that if there's tripwires, you're going to have everything from being able to secure that facility so that you're not getting breached.
[02:22:40.222 --> 02:22:40.442]  Right.
[02:22:40.783 --> 02:22:45.688]  And the interesting thing about this is that it's not just one facility.
[02:22:45.728 --> 02:22:46.809]  So it feels like a one off.
[02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:51.814]  I've had a situation where it's like, oh, that guy may be a little paranoid or he's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:22:51.854 --> 02:23:03.586]  But when it's happening systematically across multiple platforms with many risk managers, many brokers of like, OK, well, we got to also protect our electrical systems.
[02:23:04.051 --> 02:23:06.654]  Our power generation, our backup power generation.
[02:23:06.954 --> 02:23:18.466]  And if those things get hit, who's bringing that additional KW on a skid that we can actually have a fuel cell attached to it so we can actually plug and play into our buildings.
[02:23:19.187 --> 02:23:20.969]  So they're planning for it.
[02:23:21.829 --> 02:23:23.589]  And I always tell people like, they're like, what can I do?
[02:23:23.649 --> 02:23:24.209]  I'm like, you know what?
[02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:25.250]  Get involved, right?
[02:23:25.290 --> 02:23:29.611]  Get a committee, get a small group of you together in your city, in your community, right?
[02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:31.211]  Go meet with the sheriff's department.
[02:23:31.551 --> 02:23:32.531]  See what their plans are.
[02:23:32.571 --> 02:23:33.811]  Go meet with the fire department.
[02:23:34.111 --> 02:23:35.192]  See what their plans are.
[02:23:35.592 --> 02:23:44.774]  For us, we're in this so deep into this thing that we're also having communications to be able to listen to the dark web and stand alone.
[02:23:44.814 --> 02:23:51.595]  Like if we're not listening to any media or any public service announcements, because if we've learned anything in this process,
[02:23:52.395 --> 02:23:55.876]  And I have to say it is there's nothing but lies coming out.
[02:23:56.036 --> 02:23:59.597]  So the discernment is going to be on who's got the best intel.
[02:24:00.197 --> 02:24:01.917]  And I don't listen to it to a third party.
[02:24:01.957 --> 02:24:07.058]  I want to make sure that my sentinels, my guys that are doing the deep dive are listening to the communication.
[02:24:07.419 --> 02:24:08.359]  We have overwatch.
[02:24:08.399 --> 02:24:09.799]  We see how groups are moving in.
[02:24:10.339 --> 02:24:11.219]  It's really no different.
[02:24:11.259 --> 02:24:15.720]  We have a team right now that's in Haiti and Haiti is completely falling apart.
[02:24:16.281 --> 02:24:21.962]  And I have great security operators that are there protecting a 40 acre parcel in an orphanage.
[02:24:22.611 --> 02:24:26.133]  And part of my team is working alongside another group that's leading it.
[02:24:26.694 --> 02:24:31.056]  But these guys are going area to area, burning down houses, burning down villages.
[02:24:31.577 --> 02:24:34.479]  And they're like the last kind of stronghold right now.
[02:24:35.099 --> 02:24:39.902]  And if you want to get an AR-15, it's going to cost you about $8,000 in Haiti right now.
[02:24:40.582 --> 02:24:44.365]  So trying to get hardware in when the system collapses.
[02:24:44.878 --> 02:24:46.438]  Man, that's not a time to be complacent.
[02:24:46.458 --> 02:24:47.799]  This is not the time to be complacent.
[02:24:47.819 --> 02:24:50.039]  This is the time to actually get your house in order.
[02:24:50.059 --> 02:24:50.879]  I always say this.
[02:24:51.199 --> 02:24:54.240]  Get your house in order first spiritually, the next physically.
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:55.721]  And know where your mind's at.
[02:24:55.781 --> 02:24:59.701]  Don't get clogged up watching all this CNN and mainstream news.
[02:24:59.742 --> 02:25:00.542]  Get some intel.
[02:25:00.822 --> 02:25:04.163]  And the other part of it is make sure that all your systems are in place.
[02:25:04.923 --> 02:25:07.323]  Make sure all your batteries, your backup chargers are in place.
[02:25:07.343 --> 02:25:09.484]  You have your food, your water purification systems.
[02:25:09.504 --> 02:25:10.224]  You've drilled it.
[02:25:10.842 --> 02:25:12.163]  And then just turn it off.
[02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:12.684]  Turn it off.
[02:25:12.724 --> 02:25:15.106]  Go back to living life as if nothing's going to happen.
[02:25:15.507 --> 02:25:18.129]  But be prepared like for this to pop off in the next hour.
[02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:19.571]  That's how it should be.
[02:25:19.611 --> 02:25:20.792]  You should be that ready to go.
[02:25:22.401 --> 02:25:23.801]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[02:25:23.861 --> 02:25:26.262]  And Haiti's a microcosm of what's going to happen in these U.S.
[02:25:26.282 --> 02:25:26.562]  cities.
[02:25:26.582 --> 02:25:27.863]  This has been done on purpose.
[02:25:28.943 --> 02:25:39.967]  From your deep research and deep dive and tracking what Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and these gangs are saying on the dark web, because we see them saying it publicly, they've been told they're here to take over.
[02:25:40.007 --> 02:25:41.307]  They say, we're here to take over.
[02:25:41.327 --> 02:25:42.268]  The Democrats brought us here.
[02:25:42.608 --> 02:25:43.548]  We're going to take your houses.
[02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:44.128]  We'll take everything.
[02:25:44.148 --> 02:25:44.949]  This is a takeover.
[02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:47.289]  They believe there's about to be a communist overthrow.
[02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:48.630]  Antifa believes that.
[02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:51.521]  How do you see that being executed?
[02:25:51.541 --> 02:25:54.464]  And why would the deep state want that?
[02:25:55.164 --> 02:26:00.089]  Well, so during the BLM riots and the protests, right, you saw them busing these people in, right?
[02:26:00.129 --> 02:26:01.270]  They're from out of town.
[02:26:01.310 --> 02:26:02.190]  They're busing them in.
[02:26:02.471 --> 02:26:03.211]  It was paid for.
[02:26:03.611 --> 02:26:04.692]  The entire system went down.
[02:26:04.712 --> 02:26:07.855]  These guys raided, burned all kinds of stuff, and none of them got charged.
[02:26:08.355 --> 02:26:17.243]  This time around, they've moved in a huge army of illegals, military trained men in silos
[02:26:17.714 --> 02:26:19.177]  So they're not busting anybody in.
[02:26:19.217 --> 02:26:23.524]  These guys are basically going to come out of their areas that they're working systematically coordinated.
[02:26:24.425 --> 02:26:26.068]  And that's when the chaos is going to happen.
[02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:27.571]  It's it's here.
[02:26:29.123 --> 02:26:33.164]  And the thing about it, people say, oh, you know, that you're, you're, you're fear mongering, you're a conspiracist.
[02:26:33.264 --> 02:26:34.445]  Oh, I'm not a fear, fear monger.
[02:26:34.485 --> 02:26:35.185]  I don't really care.
[02:26:35.585 --> 02:26:38.006]  I just know what I'm preparing for because of the Intel.
[02:26:38.286 --> 02:26:41.027]  And I always tell people, I have a little more information that you may have.
[02:26:41.387 --> 02:26:42.607]  So you can say whatever you want.
[02:26:42.707 --> 02:26:44.088]  I just have more information than you do.
[02:26:44.108 --> 02:26:45.128]  And I'm going to move accordingly.
[02:26:45.588 --> 02:26:46.428]  And everyone's at choice.
[02:26:46.448 --> 02:26:47.709]  You can just be complacent.
[02:26:48.009 --> 02:26:50.770]  You can talk about how shit doesn't work and you can be that person.
[02:26:50.810 --> 02:26:54.871]  But when it starts raining, you're gonna, you're gonna be like, oh shit, it's a little too late.
[02:26:55.532 --> 02:26:57.373]  I mean, you gotta see what they're doing.
[02:26:57.553 --> 02:27:01.494]  Their whole thing is, every time there's a gun situation, they want to ban guns.
[02:27:01.514 --> 02:27:06.776]  They want to go, and this next administration's gonna do everything to take your guns for you, because that's the problem.
[02:27:06.836 --> 02:27:08.176]  Oh, but they say they're gonna!
[02:27:08.216 --> 02:27:09.577]  Hell yeah, we're gonna ban your guns!
[02:27:09.937 --> 02:27:11.297]  And look, here's Elon Musk today.
[02:27:11.758 --> 02:27:17.980]  I've never been materially active in politics, but this time, I think civilization, as we know it, is on the line.
[02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:22.982]  If we want to preserve freedom and meritocracy in America, then Trump must win.
[02:27:23.803 --> 02:27:28.965]  And you have Trump, who's smart, saying this is basically the end of America.
[02:27:28.985 --> 02:27:30.246]  They plan to collapse it.
[02:27:31.343 --> 02:27:33.024]  The Globalist to bring us to our knees.
[02:27:33.084 --> 02:27:37.608]  Klaus Schwab says the angrier world, destroying the old system, will bring in the new system.
[02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:39.109]  Cloward and Piven on steroids.
[02:27:39.129 --> 02:27:42.511]  So I want to shift gears, because you've been a guest before, just as a guest.
[02:27:43.412 --> 02:27:51.958]  And then I was talking to a bunch of folks, and you were being brought up by the Trump people, and brought up by Kennedy's people, and brought up by Mickey Willis, who I know you're really good friends with.
[02:27:52.358 --> 02:27:54.360]  And they're like, hey, you ought to get, you know, Steve on the show.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.941]  And then I was talking to our big sponsor that we, you know, brought back because they were able to get a whole bunch of it again.
[02:27:59.961 --> 02:28:04.282]  They couldn't even keep it with all the stuff that's going on in Ukraine.
[02:28:04.602 --> 02:28:16.845]  So they basically cut back or stopped selling, you know, to the top company, top seller in the United States of satellite phones, of Faraday backpacks, of the best solar chargers at the best prices, literally all the best systems.
[02:28:17.745 --> 02:28:20.128]  And so I wanted to get you on to talk about this company.
[02:28:20.148 --> 02:28:22.731]  You're very kind to do it, even though, you know, it's not your company.
[02:28:22.751 --> 02:28:25.013]  I know you use a lot of their gear and they give you good deals on it.
[02:28:25.053 --> 02:28:26.935]  So you're here to talk about it.
[02:28:27.236 --> 02:28:34.163]  But if people go to the Satellite Phone Company and if you go to InfoWarsPhone.com, just one word, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[02:28:34.964 --> 02:28:39.308]  You will get the best deals on satellite phones and antennas you can use in the house.
[02:28:39.348 --> 02:28:40.109]  I'm not going to be outside.
[02:28:40.590 --> 02:28:43.613]  You will get the best deals on these smartphones that aren't traceable.
[02:28:43.953 --> 02:28:47.576]  You will get the best deals on the dongle that hooks into a regular.
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:55.125]  Cell phone, but I was talking to some of these security guys after they saw the interview, and they said, Yeah, I got five million views on X. Great.
[02:28:55.426 --> 02:29:14.822]  You didn't talk about the fact that if you don't have you were trying interrupted you if you don't have the Faraday cage for the equipment, which is just a simple backpack, or you can, I guess, make one yourself like a ice chest or something that's big and, you know, put a bunch of wiring in it of mesh wire of copper, maybe line it with lead or something.
[02:29:15.842 --> 02:29:32.650]  But the point is, if you don't protect it during an EMP, or during a nuke, which is a big part of the issue, or during... people can't hack into these things, it's very hard to anyways, but when they're in a Faraday cage, they're walled off and protected, so we need to then talk for folks that haven't gotten these phones, we should talk about those first.
[02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:37.492]  And the last time you were on, a lot of folks got these, so it really supports the broadcast, it's a win-win, it's something they need.
[02:29:38.432 --> 02:29:41.394]  The reason I reached back out to the satellite phone company,
[02:29:42.338 --> 02:29:44.101]  And said, hey, you got everything back in stock, I noticed.
[02:29:44.121 --> 02:29:45.523]  You're not sold out constantly.
[02:29:46.003 --> 02:29:46.845]  They said, it's perfect time.
[02:29:46.865 --> 02:29:48.107]  We've been wanting to come back on.
[02:29:48.147 --> 02:29:50.129]  We've really gotten a massive stuff, though.
[02:29:50.170 --> 02:29:51.131]  It's going to sell out quickly.
[02:29:52.205 --> 02:29:56.870]  I was calling him because I was like, Hey, I got two of those sat phones from a few years ago.
[02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:57.510]  That's not enough.
[02:29:57.530 --> 02:29:59.212]  I got them in each car, even the house.
[02:29:59.232 --> 02:30:00.073]  I want to give them to family.
[02:30:00.133 --> 02:30:01.114]  I'm telling family to get it.
[02:30:01.574 --> 02:30:03.976]  And then I'm thinking, wait, I do need, that's right here.
[02:30:04.017 --> 02:30:05.018]  It's got a bunch of these units.
[02:30:05.078 --> 02:30:05.618]  Beautiful.
[02:30:06.139 --> 02:30:08.441]  Look at this beautiful, high quality backpack.
[02:30:08.481 --> 02:30:09.602]  It has a Faraday cage in it.
[02:30:09.622 --> 02:30:14.607]  It's not even heavy, but everything in there, all the phones, the dongles, the systems,
[02:30:18.041 --> 02:30:22.585]  Well, for your listeners, you just have to pay attention to what's going on in the climate.
[02:30:47.358 --> 02:30:57.324]  If you see that they actually assigned 50 satellite phones to the left of the Democrats, and they put it out there just in case there's a crisis, right?
[02:30:57.764 --> 02:30:58.785]  It's like, oh, shit.
[02:30:58.845 --> 02:31:02.727]  Well, they know something's coming, so they're going to be using sat communication, right?
[02:31:02.747 --> 02:31:06.970]  They know the average citizen's not buying a sat phone, and they're not putting it out to the masses.
[02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:08.751]  Obviously, you don't hear it on mainstream news.
[02:31:09.451 --> 02:31:17.775]  The other part of it is when you have 60 tons of ammonium nitrate go missing, as you remember, it only took three tons to take the Oklahoma City building down.
[02:31:18.235 --> 02:31:20.736]  Three tons, there's 60 tons just vanished into thin air.
[02:31:21.336 --> 02:31:21.536]  Right?
[02:31:21.596 --> 02:31:32.901]  So all these things that are being prepared, really for us in our world from the disaster response side of it, or the security side of it, we always say communication controls chaos.
[02:31:33.542 --> 02:31:36.143]  If your phones go out, you're not talking to your kids.
[02:31:36.603 --> 02:31:38.104]  You know, so for us in my world,
[02:31:38.999 --> 02:31:41.381]  I carry a sat phone literally everywhere I go.
[02:31:41.661 --> 02:31:43.883]  My wife, my kids all have sat phones.
[02:31:44.544 --> 02:31:46.825]  My team members, every one of them has a sat phone.
[02:31:47.086 --> 02:31:56.974]  And every one of my emergency responding companies, the vendors that are on our network on a national basis and a global basis, I have them all on a roster, including your number, Alex.
[02:31:56.994 --> 02:32:04.800]  So we're already dialed in to people that are in that network for information to get out to the public and how they can actually steer which way to go.
[02:32:06.756 --> 02:32:10.579]  One thing that I want to share also is, yeah, the Faraday sleeve is important, right?
[02:32:10.599 --> 02:32:22.809]  Because if an EMP happens, or they call a solar flare happened, or we get hacked by China, Russia, whatever else, and your comms go down, as many times comms have gone down, people are not going to be able to communicate.
[02:32:22.849 --> 02:32:27.733]  So if you turned your phone off right now, do you know where your kids are, how to get a hold of them, and where they're moving?
[02:32:28.373 --> 02:32:30.034]  Or where your husband is, or your wife?
[02:32:31.195 --> 02:32:33.117]  The chaos is absolutely insane.
[02:32:33.809 --> 02:32:36.472]  So for us, we program every single number into it.
[02:32:36.672 --> 02:32:39.494]  Every quarter we do a call and we circulate that call.
[02:32:39.595 --> 02:32:50.565]  It's also a reminder to charge the battery on the phone, make sure nothing's glitching, put it back, charge it, put it back in the Faraday sleeves, drop it in my go bag, which sits in my car, or I take it on my person if I'm traveling.
[02:32:51.943 --> 02:32:52.804]  Those things are critical.
[02:32:52.944 --> 02:32:53.784]  And that's key.
[02:32:53.824 --> 02:32:58.947]  So the Infowarsphone.com, the satellite phone company, that's how you go there, Infowarsphone.com.
[02:32:59.267 --> 02:33:01.148]  They've got the little sleeves that are great.
[02:33:01.408 --> 02:33:03.550]  They've got the backpacks with the big sleeves.
[02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:04.990]  They've got everything you need right there.
[02:33:05.531 --> 02:33:07.472]  Yeah, and I'll tell you, I'm not a fan of the Emersat.
[02:33:07.492 --> 02:33:08.052]  That's just me.
[02:33:08.072 --> 02:33:08.753]  Some people like it.
[02:33:10.057 --> 02:33:11.618]  It doesn't have as many satellites up there.
[02:33:11.818 --> 02:33:13.900]  I'm just a big fan of the Iridium, you know?
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:18.623]  That backpack that you showed, which is pretty cool, is a backpack that's ballistic.
[02:33:18.683 --> 02:33:20.104]  It's got a level 3A, right?
[02:33:20.164 --> 02:33:21.485]  For your pistol rounds.
[02:33:22.065 --> 02:33:23.006]  9mm and so on.
[02:33:23.946 --> 02:33:31.011]  You can increase that by putting another plate in there, another... several layers of that Kevlar-type system in there.
[02:33:31.612 --> 02:33:39.257]  But especially right now, if your kids are going to school, or they're at the mall, or they're on a train, or all the shit that's happening, it's just kind of another layer
[02:33:39.724 --> 02:33:46.105]  Keeping their phone secure in that Faraday part of the pocket, having the ballistics layer on there.
[02:33:46.145 --> 02:33:47.766]  I think that's really good.
[02:33:47.806 --> 02:33:52.106]  But also, also just using the phones, getting used to using them, having the backpack.
[02:33:52.187 --> 02:33:53.127]  It gets you in the game.
[02:33:53.167 --> 02:33:53.987]  It gets you focused.
[02:33:54.467 --> 02:33:57.448]  Yeah, because if you're, you open the phone, it's not like you're dialing a normal number.
[02:33:57.468 --> 02:33:59.288]  You got to hold that plus sign down.
[02:33:59.308 --> 02:34:00.928]  So you have that plus and then the one and the three.
[02:34:00.948 --> 02:34:01.208]  What else?
[02:34:01.228 --> 02:34:05.389]  So you at least know how to actually program the phone and how to make the phone calls, right?
[02:34:05.889 --> 02:34:07.230]  So you're putting cell phone ins in there.
[02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:08.410]  You're putting sat phones in there.
[02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:09.450]  Those are all
[02:34:10.205 --> 02:34:12.329]  It's all part of what we call a comms plan, right?
[02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:16.897]  Or you do what we call an SOG, a standard operation guidelines or SOP, right?
[02:34:16.957 --> 02:34:21.325]  Procedure, standard operating procedures of what you're going to do and how your communication is going to be for your family.
[02:34:21.718 --> 02:34:24.379]  For your friends in your community, like where you're going to have a meeting point.
[02:34:24.399 --> 02:34:28.721]  So if nothing works, at least you have a check in board and it controls chaos.
[02:34:28.741 --> 02:34:29.321]  There's peace.
[02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:35.324]  Like during the Lahaina fires, when we were, we were talking, there was one family that actually, part of the family got evacuated to one shelter.
[02:34:35.344 --> 02:34:36.984]  Another family got evacuated to another shelter.
[02:34:37.284 --> 02:34:39.285]  And for days, they didn't know the other ones were alive.
[02:34:39.365 --> 02:34:44.507]  So imagine the stress and the breakdown that could have been completely avoided by having sad phones.
[02:34:44.547 --> 02:34:46.148]  And when the cell towers went down,
[02:34:46.448 --> 02:34:50.609]  Can you imagine if more people had sat phones to be able to say, hey, this is how you evacuate.
[02:34:50.949 --> 02:34:52.090]  These areas are closed down.
[02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.990]  Here's your exit out.
[02:34:53.610 --> 02:34:56.331]  I mean, the amount of lives that could be saved from that type of scenario.
[02:34:56.811 --> 02:35:09.015]  You know, there's that one family just recently in the news in Arizona that 100 people got rescued because one guy had one sat phone and he called in for a rescue.
[02:35:09.475 --> 02:35:14.177]  And unfortunately, the sad news about that was the guy that actually made the phone call, his wife,
[02:35:14.881 --> 02:35:17.462]  Ended up dying in that flash flood that came through.
[02:35:17.642 --> 02:35:19.223]  So I can't tell you.
[02:35:19.263 --> 02:35:21.904]  I mean, that's just one of the most important things is that part of it.
[02:35:22.244 --> 02:35:26.265]  I mean, we're doing the big event in DC, the Rescue the Republic event.
[02:35:27.406 --> 02:35:30.347]  And this is the country's leader that are going to be speaking on that platform.
[02:35:30.407 --> 02:35:34.388]  So on that part of it, every one of our team members has sat phones.
[02:35:34.848 --> 02:35:36.349]  We also have sat radios.
[02:35:36.549 --> 02:35:38.309]  We're taking the next layer, right?
[02:35:38.329 --> 02:35:39.590]  So we have no interruption.
[02:35:40.310 --> 02:35:42.451]  And then we also have the Secure Phone.
[02:35:42.491 --> 02:35:45.991]  The Secure Phone is a secure smartphone end-to-end encryption.
[02:35:46.592 --> 02:35:49.192]  Yeah, tell us about the BTM system.
[02:35:49.232 --> 02:35:50.012]  I've got it right here.
[02:35:50.573 --> 02:35:51.493]  Explain what this does.
[02:35:51.533 --> 02:35:53.313]  Explain the dongle that hooks into regular cell phones.
[02:35:53.353 --> 02:35:53.813]  Explain that.
[02:35:54.634 --> 02:35:58.055]  Yeah, so, I mean, it's connect-to-mobile is what it is.
[02:35:58.115 --> 02:36:00.335]  It's hardware and software that's completely protected.
[02:36:00.675 --> 02:36:02.596]  It has a 256 encryption.
[02:36:02.616 --> 02:36:05.396]  I mean, this is a smartphone end-to-end.
[02:36:05.436 --> 02:36:07.417]  So here's the cool thing about it for us.
[02:36:08.783 --> 02:36:12.644]  During January 5th and 6th, I was there with 33 paramedics, a whole team down there.
[02:36:12.684 --> 02:36:16.745]  We were doing some board when security in town saw the entire event go on.
[02:36:17.445 --> 02:36:21.626]  And to me, our phones, phones were getting jammed out there.
[02:36:21.686 --> 02:36:22.626]  Signals are getting jammed.
[02:36:22.686 --> 02:36:23.806]  It was, it was inside.
[02:36:23.906 --> 02:36:25.066]  It absolutely crazy.
[02:36:25.086 --> 02:36:27.587]  I mean, this thing has a privacy button on it.
[02:36:28.307 --> 02:36:33.128]  You can go like, say if the phone was to be attempted to be hacked, the actual phone wipes itself clean.
[02:36:34.045 --> 02:36:57.750]  And the thing that I like about it also is that if I hit, there's a button on it that in my sandbox, we call it a sandbox because it's a secured network, I hit that button, I could put everybody on my team immediately on a screen like we're on a Zoom call, and now I'm connecting and I'm communicating with them, and nobody outside of this envelope can actually hear, see, and I can move within that area.
[02:36:58.010 --> 02:37:02.211]  I mean, one of the things that we do... Is that called like siloed communications or like when you keep...
[02:37:03.871 --> 02:37:05.472]  Yeah, siloed, we call it a sandbox, right?
[02:37:05.492 --> 02:37:07.913]  You're in a sandbox, it's just us playing in there, right?
[02:37:08.473 --> 02:37:09.434]  And nobody knows, right?
[02:37:09.494 --> 02:37:13.716]  And the VPN's bouncing off of a signal that's in Florida, so I could be anywhere.
[02:37:13.736 --> 02:37:16.578]  I could be in D.C., I could be in San Diego, I could be in Europe somewhere.
[02:37:16.878 --> 02:37:17.758]  It doesn't really matter.
[02:37:18.279 --> 02:37:22.641]  So you would use this phone if you live in Brazil to get around all the censorship happening right now?
[02:37:23.496 --> 02:37:25.397]  Yeah, yeah, because they can't track it.
[02:37:25.858 --> 02:37:26.638]  They can't track it.
[02:37:26.678 --> 02:37:27.579]  They can't access it.
[02:37:27.999 --> 02:37:29.800]  So yeah, definitely in the international community.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:33.182]  And the cool thing about it is that actually it's available to civilians now.
[02:37:33.402 --> 02:37:37.145]  You know, it's encrypted, calls protected, text message, video, everything.
[02:37:37.165 --> 02:37:38.806]  You can transfer files between it.
[02:37:39.366 --> 02:37:40.207]  And it's there.
[02:37:40.327 --> 02:37:41.508]  It's only in that silo.
[02:37:43.489 --> 02:37:43.629]  Yeah.
[02:37:46.286 --> 02:37:46.746]  I'm listening.
[02:37:46.786 --> 02:37:48.567]  I was just setting the phone back up on the counter here.
[02:37:48.587 --> 02:37:49.667]  No worries.
[02:37:49.868 --> 02:37:50.448]  All good.
[02:37:50.508 --> 02:37:56.290]  Talk about if people go to InfoWorksPhone.com and support the broadcast to get the best prices and the best deals out there.
[02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:59.512]  What are the basics they need?
[02:38:01.052 --> 02:38:11.557]  Well, the basics I feel is it's everybody, depending on what you're dealing with, what level of threat assessment preparedness you want to be at.
[02:38:11.637 --> 02:38:14.758]  But at very minimum, having a satellite phone
[02:38:15.265 --> 02:38:18.010]  At least for this time that we're in is critical.
[02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:21.376]  And then some people say, well, there's a system that it has to bounce off of.
[02:38:21.797 --> 02:38:23.700]  That system is also hardened.
[02:38:24.244 --> 02:38:28.167]  For EMP, for protection, to be able to get the signal out, right?
[02:38:28.527 --> 02:38:30.549]  So people go, well, it may not work.
[02:38:30.589 --> 02:38:33.271]  Well, shit, the satellites may come out of the sky and then it's all over.
[02:38:33.291 --> 02:38:34.392]  Yeah, so, okay.
[02:38:34.852 --> 02:38:43.338]  You could be that person or you could be like, you know, I'm going to level up and get these different levels of security features like the communications on the sat phones.
[02:38:43.738 --> 02:38:47.121]  I could get a Garmin that's also using satellite, a bivy stick.
[02:38:47.805 --> 02:38:51.368]  I can get the secure phone because I want my messaging and my stuff.
[02:38:51.688 --> 02:38:52.949]  I don't want my phones being hacked.
[02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:54.911]  Also for privacy reasons, right?
[02:38:54.971 --> 02:38:57.353]  For the fact that I don't want my communication out there.
[02:38:57.653 --> 02:38:59.574]  I want my banking information protected.
[02:38:59.594 --> 02:39:04.318]  I want my will, trust, all these things that you save on that phone is not hackable.
[02:39:04.658 --> 02:39:05.359]  You know, it's not.
[02:39:05.759 --> 02:39:07.160]  It's there that's being protected.
[02:39:08.701 --> 02:39:11.504]  One thing that I wanted to touch upon, you had talked about supplements.
[02:39:12.685 --> 02:39:17.048]  And if you look, there's a bill in California, September 12th, it's being heard.
[02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:32.761]  And if you see what California is doing, it is pushing a bill that's going to take quercetin, it's going to take aloe vera, it's going to take all these supplements that we're so used to like glutathione, these things that are actually so essential
[02:39:33.564 --> 02:39:36.807]  For the natural immunity for us to be able to boost ourselves.
[02:39:36.887 --> 02:39:40.991]  They're looking to ban these items so that you cannot use them.
[02:39:41.351 --> 02:39:42.392]  And think how criminal that is.
[02:39:42.412 --> 02:39:54.603]  They already paid, it came out last year, a few months ago, two plus billion, 2.3 billion to the major pharmacies, mainly Walgreens and CBS, not to prescribe things like ivermectin.
[02:39:54.703 --> 02:39:57.526]  And now the FDA admits they knew it worked and they suppressed it.
[02:39:57.866 --> 02:39:59.968]  And now you're saying California is trying to do that.
[02:40:00.714 --> 02:40:01.895]  Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:40:01.915 --> 02:40:04.536]  So what I'm saying is start paying attention to what's happening locally, you know?
[02:40:05.857 --> 02:40:07.418]  You know, as far as this type of stuff goes.
[02:40:07.458 --> 02:40:11.080]  So it's critical that people get more prepared.
[02:40:11.941 --> 02:40:14.342]  Get involved with your law enforcement, your fire departments.
[02:40:14.562 --> 02:40:17.904]  Look at their EOC, what their evacuations and repopulation plans are.
[02:40:18.445 --> 02:40:20.686]  Get your firearms in order.
[02:40:20.726 --> 02:40:21.787]  Get the training that you need.
[02:40:21.887 --> 02:40:23.748]  If you need to, go do a grid down training.
[02:40:23.788 --> 02:40:25.929]  We've done that many times with our SF guys.
[02:40:26.730 --> 02:40:28.751]  And there's so much to be learned, right?
[02:40:29.977 --> 02:40:34.699]  Get your power, your power generator, your backup power generator, your solar panels.
[02:40:35.259 --> 02:40:36.839]  Get your house in order, right?
[02:40:37.339 --> 02:40:45.722]  And for those that are listening to this call, I just want to impress upon everyone, go to jointheresistance.org.
[02:40:45.822 --> 02:40:48.523]  That is going to be one of the greatest rallies in D.C.
[02:40:48.983 --> 02:40:49.423]  September 29.
[02:40:49.883 --> 02:40:53.084]  If you can make it, make it.
[02:40:53.124 --> 02:40:58.026]  Because it's going to be a massive stand that shows the American people that we're about protecting our values.
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:08.043]  Informed consent, you know, protecting our God-given freedom of speech, our second amendments, constitutionality, you know, our constitution.
[02:41:08.063 --> 02:41:11.143]  These are the things that are so important for those that can make it.
[02:41:11.183 --> 02:41:11.864]  Be a part of it.
[02:41:12.424 --> 02:41:13.944]  Jointheresistance.org.
[02:41:15.244 --> 02:41:21.066]  We're also holding a big event in April for my wife's conference called Autism Health.
[02:41:21.746 --> 02:41:24.607]  And so anybody that's been impacted by autism,
[02:41:25.585 --> 02:41:34.173]  In the autism spectrum, what they call autism spectrum disorder, ASD community, there's a huge health and freedom group that's part of that.
[02:41:35.634 --> 02:41:39.898]  And so I just I encourage everyone to get involved, especially during this election time.
[02:41:39.998 --> 02:41:42.620]  Become a poll worker or even a poll watcher.
[02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:44.282]  Register, get involved, show up.
[02:41:45.018 --> 02:41:45.619]  That's right.
[02:41:45.639 --> 02:41:48.001]  So many people think they've got to save the world by themselves.
[02:41:48.181 --> 02:41:51.503]  If you just do little things, and lots of us do it, many hands make light work.
[02:41:51.864 --> 02:41:53.585]  So, folks, you go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[02:41:53.605 --> 02:41:57.208]  That way, as a sponsorship, we get support, get the very same prices that are on the site.
[02:41:57.268 --> 02:41:58.429]  In fact, some days, there's better deals.
[02:41:58.789 --> 02:41:59.630]  You can also call 941-246-2156.
[02:41:59.650 --> 02:41:59.750]  941-246-2156.
[02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:04.594]  They've got everything in stock, including their new hottest item, the Faraday cage.
[02:42:10.879 --> 02:42:13.802]  Bullet resistant backpack that is so amazing.
[02:42:14.142 --> 02:42:14.723]  Heavy duty.
[02:42:14.823 --> 02:42:17.566]  This is what people need, and it supports the broadcast.
[02:42:17.626 --> 02:42:23.231]  It is a no-brainer, and I'm very frustrated because I'm fighting to stay on air and fighting to have the latest info, and I'll be doing that 100%.
[02:42:23.612 --> 02:42:30.959]  But out of necessity, I am now setting up backups for everything because we are now in that zone, like Noah's Ark.
[02:42:30.999 --> 02:42:32.260]  We don't want to be caught flat-footed.
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:33.882]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:42:33.902 --> 02:42:34.623]  And just like he said,
[02:42:35.123 --> 02:42:36.804]  He's not, you know, involved in supplements.
[02:42:36.824 --> 02:42:44.110]  He's not involved in quercetin and ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and vitamin C. They're trying to move to stop you from getting it.
[02:42:44.390 --> 02:42:45.892]  It's literally happening.
[02:42:45.932 --> 02:42:47.313]  I have the CEO of a major company on.
[02:42:47.353 --> 02:42:48.033]  He's not a sponsor.
[02:42:48.534 --> 02:42:53.197]  He flew down here from Utah to beyond, where the government's suing him.
[02:42:53.217 --> 02:43:00.163]  He spent $3 million fighting him for reading off the CDC website that nasal spray with xylitol is known to block viruses.
[02:43:00.743 --> 02:43:01.724]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:43:01.744 --> 02:43:03.125]  It's on their website, the government's website.
[02:43:03.345 --> 02:43:05.287]  But they literally want to control you.
[02:43:05.327 --> 02:43:06.368]  They want you desperate.
[02:43:06.728 --> 02:43:08.149]  They want the food and water cut off.
[02:43:08.169 --> 02:43:11.512]  They want to have excuses to do it, so they can bring you to your knees.
[02:43:11.552 --> 02:43:13.134]  There's a name for that in ancient warfare.
[02:43:13.774 --> 02:43:14.254]  Siege.
[02:43:14.855 --> 02:43:17.057]  And the West is under siege, aren't we, Steve?
[02:43:17.777 --> 02:43:20.780]  Yeah, and in closing, like, people just... I'm not here to sell anybody, right?
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:25.003]  But if you saw when the Ukraine war popped up, they couldn't get phones for nine months back in stock, right?
[02:43:25.344 --> 02:43:27.986]  Why, NATO commanders, everybody else came and fought them all out.
[02:43:28.683 --> 02:43:30.044]  You know, it's the same thing during COVID.
[02:43:30.104 --> 02:43:31.785]  All the gun shops' prices went through the roof.
[02:43:31.825 --> 02:43:32.645]  You couldn't get ammo.
[02:43:32.685 --> 02:43:34.646]  There was an ammo shortage.
[02:43:35.247 --> 02:43:41.290]  If this pops off the way that it's happening, that the way everyone's feeling within their spirit that's leading them, you're not getting sad phones.
[02:43:41.390 --> 02:43:42.330]  You're not getting ammo.
[02:43:42.350 --> 02:43:43.251]  You're not getting anything.
[02:43:43.911 --> 02:43:45.012]  If you get food, you're lucky.
[02:43:45.552 --> 02:43:55.337]  So smarten up, get your stuff together, get your house in order, because you don't want to be that man or that woman whose response for others in your house and not be prepared.
[02:43:55.437 --> 02:43:56.218]  Steve, stay there.
[02:43:56.238 --> 02:43:58.039]  If you have to go, I understand, but I want to do a little bit more.
[02:43:58.991 --> 02:44:06.516]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[02:44:07.117 --> 02:44:09.398]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[02:44:10.019 --> 02:44:16.543]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[02:44:16.563 --> 02:44:20.126]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[02:44:20.586 --> 02:44:26.750]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[02:44:27.651 --> 02:44:36.320]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:45.630]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:47.151]  These are very, very popular.
[02:44:47.191 --> 02:44:48.252]  And I went and looked it up online.
[02:44:48.653 --> 02:44:49.574]  It is very, very popular.
[02:44:50.154 --> 02:44:51.075]  It's not an investment.
[02:44:51.275 --> 02:44:51.915]  It's a collectible.
[02:44:52.096 --> 02:44:59.001]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:44:59.461 --> 02:45:00.502]  Best group out there.
[02:45:00.822 --> 02:45:01.563]  Highest ratings.
[02:45:02.103 --> 02:45:02.984]  Amazing prices.
[02:45:03.024 --> 02:45:03.484]  The best.
[02:45:03.705 --> 02:45:07.768]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[02:45:08.308 --> 02:45:16.034]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here in your store.
[02:45:17.135 --> 02:45:17.956]  And they kicked him back.
[02:45:19.228 --> 02:45:22.829]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[02:45:23.129 --> 02:45:34.273]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[02:45:34.793 --> 02:45:43.176]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[02:45:43.756 --> 02:45:45.077]  They're amazing cards.
[02:45:45.097 --> 02:45:46.939]  It's got original art I came up with.
[02:45:46.959 --> 02:45:48.820]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:51.822]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[02:45:51.842 --> 02:45:52.623]  You'll have a historical memento.
[02:46:06.693 --> 02:46:11.616]  As a keepsake for yourself, for your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight.
[02:46:12.016 --> 02:46:15.838]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[02:46:16.198 --> 02:46:17.519]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:46:18.159 --> 02:46:21.060]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:24.622]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[02:46:24.982 --> 02:46:29.844]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[02:46:30.225 --> 02:46:32.306]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[02:46:33.106 --> 02:46:35.107]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[02:46:35.587 --> 02:46:39.069]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:39.709]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:46:40.269 --> 02:46:42.470]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:43.270]  That's not what this is.
[02:46:43.290 --> 02:46:44.331]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[02:46:44.931 --> 02:46:58.016]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[02:46:58.297 --> 02:46:59.217]  I know you don't want to do that.
[02:46:59.944 --> 02:47:02.946]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[02:47:03.767 --> 02:47:05.087]  Something like that, $10 or $11.
[02:47:05.628 --> 02:47:10.311]  And so the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[02:47:10.351 --> 02:47:13.493]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[02:47:14.033 --> 02:47:21.718]  So get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[02:47:22.078 --> 02:47:23.179]  The decision is yours.
[02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:24.600]  This is a limited edition.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:29.624]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[02:47:30.264 --> 02:47:40.552]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[02:47:40.932 --> 02:47:49.839]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:51.080]  Thank you for your support.
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:53.082]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[02:47:59.181 --> 02:48:00.384]  Steve Slobsovich is our guest.
[02:48:00.424 --> 02:48:01.206]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:48:01.226 --> 02:48:04.695]  He's with us until about 15 after the great Dernandez takes over.
[02:48:06.111 --> 02:48:12.697]  The New York Post has now released the reported main suspect, Colt Gray, in Georgia.
[02:48:12.737 --> 02:48:15.259]  We've got more details, the FBI knowing all about him and doing nothing.
[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:17.481]  How about slow rolling?
[02:48:17.541 --> 02:48:18.682]  That is coming up.
[02:48:18.702 --> 02:48:22.405]  We'll break that down some next segment before we hand the baton to Drew Hernandez.
[02:48:22.425 --> 02:48:31.653]  But I was asking you during the break to specify, the law enforcement and others you're talking to at the highest levels, why they're so concerned and what they think the deep state's planning.
[02:48:34.744 --> 02:48:40.851]  The law enforcement is concerned because they've been actually, if you know these guys, they've been told not to speak publicly, right?
[02:48:40.871 --> 02:48:42.512]  They have a public information officer.
[02:48:42.933 --> 02:48:47.197]  They're not allowed to comment on things that they see that's happening in their cities, in their communities.
[02:48:48.058 --> 02:48:56.908]  The intel that we get from them, that I'm getting from them, is because I've been friends with them from them since my high school years, you know, and now they're the upper ranking guys, they're
[02:48:57.418 --> 02:49:01.661]  They're getting close to retirement and their ear is on everything that's happening.
[02:49:01.741 --> 02:49:13.568]  So when we're having these lunch meetings and meeting for breakfast or grabbing a quick beer, what they're saying is what I'm simply sharing that people need to get their house in order.
[02:49:14.248 --> 02:49:15.869]  It's not just the Venezuelan gangs.
[02:49:15.909 --> 02:49:19.771]  You have multiple groups that have created their gang groups.
[02:49:19.871 --> 02:49:21.452]  The Chileans are out as well.
[02:49:21.492 --> 02:49:22.873]  They have their own sector.
[02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:26.035]  And so these guys have created like silos or
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:29.302]  Groups that they're out there terrorizing the people.
[02:49:29.342 --> 02:49:34.926]  So you have the people that are just doing the raiding homes, you know, stealing stuff, taking over these apartments, that type of stuff.
[02:49:35.267 --> 02:49:42.693]  But there's a whole nother underground element of these military age men that were trained in military camps that are here on American soil.
[02:49:42.733 --> 02:49:44.134]  And those guys are organized.
[02:49:44.574 --> 02:49:51.940]  As a matter of fact, talking to one of them, he goes, Steve, we're observing them because our stuff is we do a lot of overwatch with our drones.
[02:49:53.241 --> 02:49:54.522]  I know how these guys walk.
[02:49:54.966 --> 02:50:05.736]  So when they walk in a specific formation just to go get food or dinner, and they're in a staggered pattern and they're walking, it's already built in them innately.
[02:50:05.877 --> 02:50:06.938]  This is how they're trained.
[02:50:07.038 --> 02:50:11.142]  And they're moving through the city just to go to dinner, but they're wired that way.
[02:50:11.182 --> 02:50:14.605]  They're programmed that way because all they've been is trained in a battle zone.
[02:50:14.625 --> 02:50:18.689]  So for them, they walk as if there's a threat around them.
[02:50:19.727 --> 02:50:21.831]  And so these are these are guys that are military trained.
[02:50:21.851 --> 02:50:27.482]  These are not people that are average civilian that walk through with their hoodies on, four or five of them bunched up together.
[02:50:27.963 --> 02:50:28.844]  They're staggered.
[02:50:28.864 --> 02:50:29.706]  They're in a formation.
[02:50:30.595 --> 02:50:32.196]  As if they're actually on patrol.
[02:50:32.317 --> 02:50:35.319]  And we've seen this in countless videos on the Texas and Arizona border.
[02:50:36.921 --> 02:50:42.085]  Chinese military age men, obviously military, same boots, same backpacks, same clothing companies.
[02:50:42.665 --> 02:50:44.287]  You see the same thing with Latin Americans.
[02:50:44.327 --> 02:50:46.148]  And you can see these are not grunts.
[02:50:46.669 --> 02:50:49.892]  These are, you'll see the old guy that's obviously in charge.
[02:50:50.892 --> 02:50:52.394]  You'll see the officers under him.
[02:50:52.954 --> 02:50:56.117]  I mean, they're clearly bringing in communication teams, you name it.
[02:50:56.772 --> 02:51:01.034]  Yeah, I mean, as you know, we were on with Charlie Kirk on the six-part docuseries called Border Battles.
[02:51:01.134 --> 02:51:02.734]  Then I took Bobby RFK Jr.
[02:51:02.774 --> 02:51:09.617]  to the border on his documentary called Midnight at the Border, which your viewers would benefit from watching that, about 20 minutes.
[02:51:11.077 --> 02:51:26.123]  But there was literally busloads after busloads of Chinese national, men, well-dressed, organized, very fit, and busloads of West Africans from Senegal and all those other areas coming off, no wives, no kids,
[02:51:26.567 --> 02:51:30.009]  A simple backpack, and they look like sport athletes.
[02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:31.911]  These are trained men.
[02:51:32.471 --> 02:51:42.078]  And what I shared on your prior thing, and I'm gonna share it again, just as a reminder, with a thousand of my guys that are highly trained, we can bring LA County to its knees.
[02:51:43.038 --> 02:51:54.146]  And the reality is that if you had 200,000 that they know they're registered, and they know the military camps they trained at, that are within the United States, that they have recorded,
[02:51:54.978 --> 02:51:56.659]  Imagine what they don't have recorded.
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:52:05.506]  And the crazy thing about what people don't understand is you cannot leave China without a passport and a purpose that you're leaving, especially if you're a single male.
[02:52:05.887 --> 02:52:07.048]  My family's from Serbia.
[02:52:07.428 --> 02:52:13.573]  It took me years to get paperwork, even though I have a direct relationship with the Serbian government and the Serbian embassy.
[02:52:13.593 --> 02:52:23.000]  It took me years for my cousin, who's married, who owns property, who has two kids, to come over, and they would only let him come over by himself, not with his family.
[02:52:23.621 --> 02:52:25.382]  You don't think China is more restrictive?
[02:52:26.162 --> 02:52:28.443]  And some of these other countries are way more restrictive?
[02:52:28.463 --> 02:52:29.223]  They're invading us.
[02:52:29.243 --> 02:52:31.243]  So let's ask why when we come back.
[02:52:31.323 --> 02:52:32.124]  What's the plan?
[02:52:32.864 --> 02:52:33.924]  Who are they controlled by?
[02:52:34.224 --> 02:52:35.965]  With Steve Sleptovich straight ahead.
[02:52:36.065 --> 02:52:37.005]  Final segment with him.
[02:52:37.566 --> 02:52:39.406]  We got big breaking news straight ahead.
[02:52:39.426 --> 02:52:41.807]  We've got a lot of breaking news I'm going to hit here in a moment.
[02:52:42.642 --> 02:52:44.043]  We're finishing up with our special guest.
[02:52:44.063 --> 02:52:49.107]  Steve Sleptovich, who is a very respected emergency expert and manager for government and corporations.
[02:52:49.788 --> 02:52:58.095]  I've been interviewing him for years, but he's here with us right now talking about getting prepared for some stations that don't care that first five you were getting into the Chinese military mails.
[02:52:58.795 --> 02:53:04.798]  Uh, the Latin American military males, the African military males, the same gear, coming in in military formation, now showing up around the country.
[02:53:05.279 --> 02:53:18.866]  Obviously Communist China controls a lot of those, but why would the Biden administration flood the country with at least, admitted number, 200,000 military men that they know were trained in foreign countries that are congregating, that are staying together, that are getting NGO funding?
[02:53:19.166 --> 02:53:20.687]  I mean, clearly they're planning for something big.
[02:53:20.727 --> 02:53:22.028]  Is it going to be a Red Dawn event?
[02:53:22.368 --> 02:53:23.629]  Are they going to claim it's domestic groups?
[02:53:23.729 --> 02:53:25.089]  Uprising if Trump gets reelected?
[02:53:25.850 --> 02:53:27.951]  What, what is your personal view and what is your intel?
[02:53:29.150 --> 02:53:32.613]  My personal view is the left is completely compromised.
[02:53:32.993 --> 02:53:34.054]  That happened a long time ago.
[02:53:34.114 --> 02:53:40.839]  You can just see on all the information that's coming out as to how much money they've received from foreign governments, especially from China, right?
[02:53:42.381 --> 02:53:43.902]  So that system's compromised.
[02:53:43.942 --> 02:53:46.004]  Hojo's chief of staff, communist Chinese agent.
[02:53:46.284 --> 02:53:47.945]  Wall's communist Chinese agent.
[02:53:47.985 --> 02:53:50.087]  I mean, half of them are CHICOM agents.
[02:53:50.899 --> 02:53:51.340]  Yeah.
[02:53:51.460 --> 02:54:02.373]  And even with the recent agent that they got that with, you know, the New York mayors that got that got busted, that they arrested that the Chinese national agent for CCP.
[02:54:02.814 --> 02:54:04.516]  I mean, this has been going on for years.
[02:54:04.536 --> 02:54:06.198]  They've been they basically got bribed.
[02:54:06.218 --> 02:54:06.839]  They got the money.
[02:54:07.538 --> 02:54:11.759]  And this has happened since the Hillary Foundation, since Hillary Clinton.
[02:54:12.099 --> 02:54:13.279]  I mean, it's been going on for years.
[02:54:13.319 --> 02:54:16.160]  Basically what it is, they've opened up a back door into America.
[02:54:16.180 --> 02:54:19.961]  And as Reagan said, the only way to collapse America is from within.
[02:54:20.501 --> 02:54:21.181]  So this is how you do it.
[02:54:21.201 --> 02:54:23.942]  You flood the country, you create a civil unrest.
[02:54:23.962 --> 02:54:27.843]  And I always tell people, we're not going to go put the fire out in Taiwan.
[02:54:28.163 --> 02:54:32.084]  We're not going to continue these endless wars when our own house is on fire.
[02:54:33.004 --> 02:54:33.304]  And so
[02:54:33.905 --> 02:54:37.707]  We built a lot of enemies over the years, and now it's coming to roost at our home.
[02:54:37.788 --> 02:54:55.299]  And listen, when people say, when people like General Flynn, who's a good, dear friend of mine, one of the best people I know, because I've worked with him on some other ops, and I've seen that guy's character through and through, one of the best American patriots, fighting for this country, working in so many different areas.
[02:54:55.339 --> 02:55:01.603]  When he says there'll be multiple Black Swan events, we're headed for a major crisis.
[02:55:02.318 --> 02:55:03.939]  He's not doing that to alarm people.
[02:55:04.679 --> 02:55:11.162]  Here's an intel officer who's had this entire career, has been in that security sector, in the government.
[02:55:11.703 --> 02:55:14.324]  He still has deep roots in that whole aspect of it.
[02:55:14.584 --> 02:55:17.045]  When he says it, I simply say, listen up.
[02:55:17.586 --> 02:55:22.268]  For me, I take my sources from the people I have on the local level and on the national level.
[02:55:22.288 --> 02:55:31.913]  And after he said that, Steve, the WEF said that was going to happen two weeks ago, and then the FBI came out and said multiple black swan events two weeks ago.
[02:55:32.537 --> 02:55:32.737]  Yep.
[02:55:33.597 --> 02:55:35.178]  So they're preparing us, right?
[02:55:35.578 --> 02:55:37.799]  They're saying China's going to hit a cyber attack.
[02:55:37.839 --> 02:55:39.099]  We need more money for the FBI.
[02:55:39.119 --> 02:55:40.600]  We need a lot more money for our budget.
[02:55:41.580 --> 02:55:47.522]  Listen, at this time and point in our lives, discernment is going to be everything.
[02:55:48.823 --> 02:55:55.105]  Listen, people need to continue supporting shows like yours that are actually independent truth seekers.
[02:55:55.585 --> 02:56:00.807]  Every time I've been in these disaster zones at Ground Zero, we're there typically three days before, especially when it's a hurricane.
[02:56:01.189 --> 02:56:08.092]  But if it's an event like a earthquake or it's a civil unrest matter or riots are breaking out, we're there the next day.
[02:56:08.112 --> 02:56:09.073]  We're there within hours.
[02:56:09.113 --> 02:56:12.034]  Like our stuff is all our gears packed, it's wheels up.
[02:56:12.294 --> 02:56:15.196]  How fast can we get to what we call our boo or base of operation?
[02:56:15.596 --> 02:56:16.576]  And then we move from there.
[02:56:16.636 --> 02:56:18.817]  Literally, we are making calls as we're going.
[02:56:19.398 --> 02:56:24.400]  So the fact that you're getting your intel from people like us on the ground,
[02:56:24.898 --> 02:56:25.998]  I have no dog in the fight.
[02:56:26.339 --> 02:56:28.440]  I say the truth, and it's amazing.
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:31.781]  We'll be on the same place with some of these mainstream news areas.
[02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:48.028]  They're there, Reuters, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, and then you have people like The High Wiretel, you, Mickey, some of the truth seekers, and that same footage will be sent to one group and all the groups, and the way they cut it up,
[02:56:48.648 --> 02:56:50.349]  It's like, why are you hiding that from the people?
[02:56:50.869 --> 02:56:51.889]  Why are you just not putting it out?
[02:56:51.909 --> 02:56:52.989]  Because it's raw data.
[02:56:53.109 --> 02:56:53.929]  Let them decide.
[02:56:53.949 --> 02:56:55.270]  Well, that's my last question.
[02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:57.170]  Now Trump's reporting is confirmed.
[02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:59.111]  Senate report almost three weeks ago.
[02:56:59.811 --> 02:57:02.332]  It's not 89,000 like it was two years ago.
[02:57:02.452 --> 02:57:04.612]  It's 325,000 missing children.
[02:57:04.652 --> 02:57:07.893]  They know many of them in physical slave labor.
[02:57:08.193 --> 02:57:09.253]  The New York Times admits it.
[02:57:09.694 --> 02:57:10.974]  And many in sex slavery.
[02:57:11.334 --> 02:57:12.634]  Talk about losing their soul.
[02:57:12.694 --> 02:57:14.935]  And we have articles pouring in every day.
[02:57:15.555 --> 02:57:17.076]  Like this one on Infowars.com.
[02:57:17.436 --> 02:57:22.298]  Previously deported, Salvadorian arrested after police find children chained to a bed in DC area.
[02:57:22.638 --> 02:57:25.419]  I mean, this is pedophile city here.
[02:57:26.139 --> 02:57:28.940]  What is your intel on the children being held at Walmarts?
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:31.081]  That's all confirmed, by the way, and being hidden from the public.
[02:57:31.101 --> 02:57:31.721]  What do you make of this?
[02:57:32.501 --> 02:57:34.102]  Well, I just know what they were doing at the border.
[02:57:34.142 --> 02:57:44.786]  I mean, at the border, there was cartel members that were literally day after day walking on buses as these people are getting to the border, walking in there, picking up their daughters and some of their sons.
[02:57:45.319 --> 02:57:51.281]  And pulling them off the buses at gunpoint, and they've never seen their kids ever since then.
[02:57:52.021 --> 02:57:55.882]  You know, I see the amount of rape trees that we've come across.
[02:57:56.302 --> 02:58:06.646]  There was an 11-year-old girl that we came across who was bleeding when we were on the other side of it, and come to find out there were seven or eight different strands of DNA in her for being raped that many times.
[02:58:07.146 --> 02:58:10.007]  We thought she was just having a period or something like that.
[02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:16.682]  You know, and then you see these kids that are coming across completely drugged, single male, same story.
[02:58:17.322 --> 02:58:18.022]  My wife left me.
[02:58:18.042 --> 02:58:18.742]  I have nowhere to go.
[02:58:18.762 --> 02:58:20.683]  The next guy walks up with another little kid.
[02:58:21.083 --> 02:58:21.823]  My wife left me.
[02:58:21.963 --> 02:58:22.663]  I had nowhere to go.
[02:58:22.764 --> 02:58:25.484]  Meanwhile, these kids are completely incoherent.
[02:58:25.865 --> 02:58:30.126]  Another group that came through, I could see that child did not look anything like the parents.
[02:58:30.806 --> 02:58:40.170]  As the interview started, that kids pushing away from them in the complete disconnection that you don't see from a paternal maternal type of relationship.
[02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:43.291]  Yeah, I mean, the amount I think it was like 800,000.
[02:58:43.551 --> 02:58:52.234]  There's 600,000 that they have registered, but they thought they feel that it's more like 800,000 missing children that have gone just in the last year alone.
[02:58:52.714 --> 02:58:57.636]  So when you when you see these type of numbers, and I see what's actually happening there,
[02:58:59.281 --> 02:59:06.150]  Um, when they come through and they're undocumented, they're not registered, they're dropping their IDs and they're getting picked up and pushed into a channel.
[02:59:06.841 --> 02:59:09.322]  Many of them are not even processed through CPP, right?
[02:59:09.342 --> 02:59:13.043]  They're not being processed by Border Patrol, and so they're just getting into interior.
[02:59:13.123 --> 02:59:14.064]  They don't exist.
[02:59:14.084 --> 02:59:15.024]  These are ghost children.
[02:59:15.064 --> 02:59:17.425]  I was about to say, these are ghost children.
[02:59:17.465 --> 02:59:19.766]  Steve Slepovich, we've got to get you back up soon.
[02:59:20.566 --> 02:59:22.647]  One more time, folks, you need to get prepared.
[02:59:23.207 --> 02:59:24.107]  He's just here talking about it.
[02:59:24.127 --> 02:59:24.747]  He's an expert.
[02:59:24.807 --> 02:59:29.289]  It's our great sponsor, one of the top sellers in the world, top in the U.S., the satellite phone company.
[02:59:29.529 --> 02:59:31.330]  If you go to infowarsphone.com,
[02:59:32.310 --> 02:59:35.354]  Then we get sponsorship support, just goes right to their website, redirects there.
[02:59:35.834 --> 02:59:49.509]  Infowarsphone.com, and people need to get not just the sad phones, not just the smart phones, they need to also get the very affordable, high quality, solar, transportable, very rugged...
[02:59:50.570 --> 02:59:51.451]  All right, folks.
[03:00:21.684 --> 03:00:22.364]  We're good to go.
[03:00:22.384 --> 03:00:22.865]  We're good to go.
[03:00:22.905 --> 03:00:23.325]  We're good to go.
[03:00:23.345 --> 03:00:23.745]  We're good to go.
[03:00:23.765 --> 03:00:24.366]  We're good to go.
[03:00:24.426 --> 03:00:24.806]  We're good to go.
[03:00:24.826 --> 03:00:25.146]  We're good to go.
[03:00:25.166 --> 03:00:25.566]  We're good to go.
[03:00:25.586 --> 03:00:26.107]  We're good to go.
[03:00:26.127 --> 03:00:27.568]  We're good to go.
[03:00:27.588 --> 03:00:28.388]  We're good to go.
[03:00:28.448 --> 03:00:29.349]  We're good to go.
[03:00:29.529 --> 03:00:30.410]  We're good to go.
[03:00:30.450 --> 03:00:31.650]  We're good to go.
[03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.991]  We're good to go.
[03:00:32.011 --> 03:00:32.591]  We're good to go.
[03:00:32.611 --> 03:00:33.752]  We're good to go.
[03:00:33.792 --> 03:00:34.552]  We're good to go.
[03:00:34.572 --> 03:00:36.053]  We're good to go.
[03:00:36.193 --> 03:00:36.954]  We're good to go.
[03:00:37.014 --> 03:00:37.674]  We're good to go.
[03:00:37.714 --> 03:00:38.835]  We're good to go.
[03:00:38.855 --> 03:00:39.435]  We're good to go.
[03:00:39.495 --> 03:00:40.116]  We're good to go.
[03:00:40.156 --> 03:00:40.596]  We're good to go.
[03:00:40.976 --> 03:00:41.797]  We're good to go.
[03:00:41.817 --> 03:00:42.217]  We're good to go.
[03:00:42.237 --> 03:00:42.717]  We're good to go.
[03:00:43.458 --> 03:00:43.878]  We're good to go.
[03:00:43.918 --> 03:00:44.238]  We're good to go.
[03:00:44.258 --> 03:00:44.999]  We're good to go.
[03:00:45.019 --> 03:00:45.439]  We're good to go.
[03:00:45.459 --> 03:00:46.760]  We're good to go.
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:47.100]  We're good to go.
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:47.480]  We're good to go.
[03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:48.641]  We're good to go.
[03:00:48.721 --> 03:00:49.221]  We're good to go.
[03:00:49.261 --> 03:00:49.582]  We're
[03:00:50.407 --> 03:00:55.712]  Georgia school shooting suspect, Colt Gray 14, whose aunt says he was begging.
[03:00:57.130 --> 03:00:58.131]  For help for years.
[03:00:58.311 --> 03:00:59.311]  They called the FBI.
[03:00:59.331 --> 03:01:00.612]  They said he was planning something.
[03:01:00.652 --> 03:01:03.674]  He was on their anti-terrorism watch list.
[03:01:04.255 --> 03:01:08.798]  But nothing was done, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:09.338 --> 03:01:12.080]  And here's ABC News, CBS News, Town Hall.
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:15.402]  Suspected Georgia school shooter was on the FBI's radar.
[03:01:15.422 --> 03:01:17.823]  14-year-old Colt Gray since he was 13.
[03:01:17.863 --> 03:01:22.647]  The shooter reportedly slaughtered four victims, two students and a teacher and a coach.
[03:01:23.593 --> 03:01:31.755]  It goes on to say they received several anonymous tips concerning his threats to commit school shootings at an undefined location at the time.
[03:01:32.375 --> 03:01:34.555]  Why he wasn't put in a psychiatric facility?
[03:01:35.396 --> 03:01:36.196]  It's the same story.
[03:01:36.256 --> 03:01:36.616]  Remember?
[03:01:36.836 --> 03:01:37.396]  Yovaldi.
[03:01:37.756 --> 03:01:39.797]  The police stood down for 76 minutes.
[03:01:40.217 --> 03:01:40.797]  Same story.
[03:01:40.817 --> 03:01:42.077]  He was saying he was going to kill people.
[03:01:42.457 --> 03:01:43.357]  He was on drugs.
[03:01:43.917 --> 03:01:46.658]  The same story with almost all these people.
[03:01:47.058 --> 03:01:50.019]  Same story with Adam Lanza and Sandy Hook.
[03:01:50.239 --> 03:01:50.439]  Over.
[03:01:51.099 --> 03:01:53.100]  And over and over again.
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:54.641]  And they don't want you investigating that.
[03:01:54.981 --> 03:01:56.281]  They don't want you looking into it.
[03:01:56.341 --> 03:01:56.601]  All right.
[03:01:56.681 --> 03:01:57.802]  Fabulous job of the crew.
[03:01:58.282 --> 03:02:04.285]  Now for the next 45 minutes, the amazing talk show host, pastor, and good friend of mine, Drew Hernandez, takes over right now.
[03:02:04.325 --> 03:02:07.146]  And then in 45 minutes, Owen Schroer in the War Room.
[03:02:07.446 --> 03:02:09.167]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:02:09.247 --> 03:02:15.209]  Live feeds of all the shows at Rillox Jones on X. Please share them because when you do, it reaches new people and we win the war.
[03:02:15.249 --> 03:02:18.371]  When you don't realize how powerful you are and don't take action, we'll fail.
[03:02:18.911 --> 03:02:20.632]  This is Neck and Neck with the New World Order, folks.
[03:02:20.692 --> 03:02:21.433]  Fight harder than ever.
[03:02:21.733 --> 03:02:23.895]  You are the Paul Reveres because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:02:23.935 --> 03:02:32.120]  And remember, while mainstream media and corporate press and enemy of the people lies to you about what's happening now, we tell you the truth about what's coming next because we are.
[03:02:32.461 --> 03:02:34.182]  Tomorrow's News Today, Drew Hernandez.
[03:02:35.558 --> 03:02:36.920]  All righty, Alex Jones.
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:38.061]  Thank you, my brother.
[03:02:38.101 --> 03:02:40.564]  Good to see you on fire, as always.
[03:02:41.064 --> 03:02:46.370]  My name is Drew Hernandez, and you are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:02:46.390 --> 03:02:53.458]  And I want to continue the conversation, especially after this horrific mass shooting took place yesterday.
[03:02:53.478 --> 03:02:55.140]  The timing is interesting.
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:56.742]  I don't think any of us are
[03:02:57.580 --> 03:03:00.762]  Really surprised by that, but it's definitely horrific.
[03:03:00.822 --> 03:03:06.347]  It's definitely deadly, and it's definitely a horrible, horrible thing to happen to children and the victims.
[03:03:07.107 --> 03:03:12.031]  But it's interesting because yesterday on X, and if you would like to follow me on X, you can find me at Drew H Live.
[03:03:12.911 --> 03:03:16.054]  When this happened, I posted the initial report.
[03:03:17.014 --> 03:03:24.180]  And I said, just watch the Harris campaign and watch the Democrats immediately politicize this within a couple hours.
[03:03:24.855 --> 03:03:31.901]  A lot of people were pissed off and that's fine because when you're ahead of things and you get ahead of things, you're going to be the first one to get hit.
[03:03:32.141 --> 03:03:35.904]  And all the Infowarriors know what that exactly feels like and looks like.
[03:03:36.665 --> 03:03:47.193]  And literally within two hours, within two hours yesterday, the White House with their DEI press secretary immediately came out and did just that.
[03:03:47.613 --> 03:03:49.295]  Within two hours.
[03:03:49.775 --> 03:03:54.399]  Karine Jean-Pierre is holding a press conference and is immediately, which I found very interesting,
[03:03:55.197 --> 03:04:07.800]  Because she not only called for gun reform, but she also specifically said yesterday, and you can see the clip on my ex, she specifically said and was calling for a ban on assault weapons.
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:18.862]  And I found that to be interesting because at the time yesterday, there were zero reports from mainstream media, independent media, law enforcement, anybody on the ground.
[03:04:19.762 --> 03:04:23.003]  Nobody had confirmed just two hours after it happened.
[03:04:23.499 --> 03:04:25.140]  What kind of firearm was used?
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:28.861]  And the White House is already saying we need to ban assault weapons.
[03:04:30.222 --> 03:04:31.883]  I don't know, you do the math on that one.
[03:04:32.403 --> 03:04:35.585]  And immediately, like I said, they were going to politicize this.
[03:04:35.605 --> 03:04:39.026]  The White House came out, politicized it within two hours.
[03:04:39.947 --> 03:04:44.229]  Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in New Hampshire politicized it within a couple hours.
[03:04:44.889 --> 03:04:48.510]  Already rolled out new talking points for gun control and gun reform.
[03:04:49.851 --> 03:04:51.572]  Politicizing the victims of
[03:04:52.190 --> 03:04:55.152]  This deadly situation, and even Gavin Newsom.
[03:04:55.413 --> 03:05:02.138]  Gavin Newsom immediately took to X and was politicizing the event instantaneously.
[03:05:02.158 --> 03:05:05.380]  And then you take a look at all the inconsistencies.
[03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:08.883]  I mean, this is all being reported by the mainstream media, and I find it interesting.
[03:05:08.903 --> 03:05:16.689]  I've been asking myself why, for the past, I don't know, 24 hours, where CNN reports that there were phone calls yesterday.
[03:05:17.461 --> 03:05:28.288]  There were phone calls in the morning before the shooting took place that there was going to be a mass shooting lethal threat, not only to the school yesterday in Georgia, but multiple schools.
[03:05:28.328 --> 03:05:29.769]  I think about maybe five or six.
[03:05:30.250 --> 03:05:31.711]  That was reported by CNN.
[03:05:32.291 --> 03:05:34.312]  And then it came out yesterday, last night.
[03:05:35.013 --> 03:05:38.535]  The FBI openly admitted that somebody dropped the mall.
[03:05:38.976 --> 03:05:43.078]  It actually kind of looked like what the FBI did with the Trump assassination on J-13.
[03:05:44.654 --> 03:05:50.699]  They admitted someone dropped the ball, they kind of threw local law enforcement under the bus.
[03:05:51.199 --> 03:05:55.123]  Because the FBI last night, they came out and said that he's been on the radar.
[03:05:55.503 --> 03:06:00.827]  And there were interviews that were conducted because Kidd was making threats in 2023.
[03:06:01.648 --> 03:06:08.954]  But it sounded like in their official statement that they left and they put the situation into the hands of the local law enforcement.
[03:06:09.814 --> 03:06:12.377]  And it turns out that the ball was dropped.
[03:06:12.537 --> 03:06:13.858]  Now the big question is why?
[03:06:14.952 --> 03:06:16.012]  I mean, we know why.
[03:06:16.212 --> 03:06:17.193]  We know the timing.
[03:06:17.313 --> 03:06:18.673]  Alex has been warning about this.
[03:06:19.393 --> 03:06:21.194]  Infowarriors have been warning about this.
[03:06:21.294 --> 03:06:26.656]  Anybody that's been paying attention has been warning that there will be events.
[03:06:27.536 --> 03:06:28.997]  There will be false flags.
[03:06:29.657 --> 03:06:39.140]  There will be possibly mass shootings, whether it be at colleges and churches or a school or
[03:06:40.123 --> 03:06:47.951]  In any way, shape or form that hands a narrative to be politicized to a particular political party that does that.
[03:06:49.192 --> 03:06:59.842]  And when you take a look at the timing and you see all of this coming together, I do find it interesting because the Harris, Kamala Harris PSYOP has died out.
[03:07:00.403 --> 03:07:01.644]  I mean, even this morning.
[03:07:02.465 --> 03:07:03.446]  I mean, a couple weeks ago,
[03:07:04.500 --> 03:07:13.446]  Everyone on X, independent journalists and reporters have all been calling out Kamala Harris for trying to pretend like she's the border security candidate all of a sudden, right?
[03:07:13.606 --> 03:07:16.688]  All of a sudden, she's the borders are again, right?
[03:07:16.828 --> 03:07:23.473]  All of a sudden, she denies she was the borders are, but now she's claiming she's going to be the borders are.
[03:07:23.533 --> 03:07:26.095]  She wants to secure the border cuz it's bad, right?
[03:07:26.575 --> 03:07:27.956]  All of a sudden, she's Donald Trump.
[03:07:28.116 --> 03:07:29.037]  No tax on tips,
[03:07:29.557 --> 03:07:36.402]  He's literally this close, this close away from just putting on a MAGA hat and saying we're gonna make America great again, and Trump doesn't.
[03:07:38.023 --> 03:07:56.535]  And so independent reporters even here on InfoWars have been pointing out that in her campaign ads, this is how desperate they've been getting, where they're actually running her as the border security candidate using footage of Trump's built border wall while he was president to paint her as if she's the one that's gonna secure this nation.
[03:07:57.313 --> 03:08:03.777]  I find that interesting because this morning now even CNN, this is when you know something is wrong, okay?
[03:08:04.117 --> 03:08:09.941]  Now even CNN has come out and pointed out the very same thing.
[03:08:09.961 --> 03:08:15.764]  You could find all these clips, I'm pretty sure Alex has posted all of them, at RealAlexJones, at InfoWars, at Drew H. Live.
[03:08:16.604 --> 03:08:19.046]  But now even CNN is coming out and pointing that out?
[03:08:19.898 --> 03:08:23.139]  Now I point this out because I've been saying this on my own show.
[03:08:23.199 --> 03:08:26.080]  You can find it at rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:28.221]  I go live Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[03:08:28.241 --> 03:08:29.142]  Pacific, 9 p.m.
[03:08:29.242 --> 03:08:29.602]  Eastern.
[03:08:30.382 --> 03:08:33.023]  I'll be covering night two of the Trump Town Hall tonight.
[03:08:34.864 --> 03:08:43.287]  But I find, I've been saying this, that the timing is interesting because you see how the Kamala coup was executed.
[03:08:43.327 --> 03:08:43.988]  It was rolled out.
[03:08:44.088 --> 03:08:44.868]  It was successful.
[03:08:45.612 --> 03:08:48.153]  It created some astroturfed momentum.
[03:08:48.173 --> 03:08:58.078]  She had these huge rallies that were causing people to question, okay, well, maybe we should take this serious because this is no longer the Joe Biden campaign anymore.
[03:08:58.119 --> 03:09:03.221]  This is the Barack Obama campaign operatives of 08 and 2012.
[03:09:04.122 --> 03:09:05.382]  Let's not underestimate this.
[03:09:05.422 --> 03:09:13.867]  And you saw a lot of calls from people within the right wing independents calling on the Trump campaign to step it up, because now's the time to step it up.
[03:09:14.107 --> 03:09:14.487]  And they did.
[03:09:15.424 --> 03:09:15.864]  And they did.
[03:09:16.624 --> 03:09:17.105]  And they did.
[03:09:17.965 --> 03:09:25.767]  But then, it seems after a few rallies, a couple weeks went by, you know, I predicted the honeymoon would last maybe around four to six weeks.
[03:09:26.487 --> 03:09:29.708]  Maybe all of the month of August, and then September it would just die out.
[03:09:29.908 --> 03:09:30.569]  It would deflate.
[03:09:32.169 --> 03:09:32.909]  And we saw that.
[03:09:32.969 --> 03:09:43.373]  We saw that the rallies were no longer producing this massive momentum that I believe was meant to carry them to the DNC.
[03:09:43.413 --> 03:09:44.013]  And then the DNC
[03:09:45.518 --> 03:09:54.205]  I think was meant, I mean, traditionally the DNC in August in a presidential election year is meant to give a boost to Democrats, same thing with the RNC, but it didn't happen.
[03:09:54.425 --> 03:10:00.670]  And part of the reason why it didn't happen is, I know Infowars covered the DNC, it was like torture.
[03:10:01.071 --> 03:10:07.176]  It was literally like being put in like a torture chamber in a chair and I don't know, it was like psychological torture, it really was.
[03:10:07.616 --> 03:10:10.999]  But we covered it, covered it on my show as well.
[03:10:11.039 --> 03:10:13.341]  I think everyone that watched it and covered it felt the same way.
[03:10:14.324 --> 03:10:17.687]  I mean, get ready for that for another four to eight years if this woman gets installed.
[03:10:18.667 --> 03:10:21.950]  But I think it had the opposite effect.
[03:10:22.050 --> 03:10:30.276]  Just the DNC itself had a seriously backfiring effect.
[03:10:31.257 --> 03:10:39.784]  And the biggest question I was asking myself as I was watching that and covering that, I'm like, how are Normies, independents, and moderates reacting to this?
[03:10:39.844 --> 03:10:41.105]  Cuz right-wingers and
[03:10:42.066 --> 03:10:45.927]  People that are actually paying attention, that are based and red-pilled, whatever you want to call it.
[03:10:46.707 --> 03:10:50.167]  We know what to expect, and we're going to unpack it, roast it, whatever.
[03:10:50.187 --> 03:10:52.208]  This is who they are.
[03:10:52.248 --> 03:10:53.008]  This is what they do.
[03:10:53.048 --> 03:10:56.589]  But I really have been asking myself, where do normies fall on this?
[03:10:56.649 --> 03:10:59.689]  You're sitting down watching this, and they're gaslighting you.
[03:10:59.709 --> 03:11:00.869]  They're lying to you.
[03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:07.710]  They're astroturfing Kamala Harris as if Trump is the incumbent, and she's the newcoming challenger.
[03:11:07.750 --> 03:11:09.211]  They've literally psyoped
[03:11:11.275 --> 03:11:16.056]  The whole plot flipped it entirely upside down.
[03:11:16.957 --> 03:11:17.637]  But that's what they do.
[03:11:17.677 --> 03:11:18.257]  It's biblical.
[03:11:18.297 --> 03:11:19.797]  They call evil good and good evil.
[03:11:21.618 --> 03:11:24.679]  And so the DNC didn't produce the momentum I think they wanted.
[03:11:25.399 --> 03:11:30.700]  And we saw even the New York Times came out, criticized them because their whole, joy!
[03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:31.921]  We're running on joy!
[03:11:31.941 --> 03:11:36.082]  Yeah, New York Times came out and said, yeah, that's not really a plan.
[03:11:37.598 --> 03:11:39.019]  And there really wasn't.
[03:11:39.059 --> 03:11:48.083]  There was somewhat, I remember Friday morning after the DNC, there was somewhat of a media push for Kamala Harris, but the New York Times weren't buying it.
[03:11:49.803 --> 03:11:51.064]  And then the RFK Jr.
[03:11:51.084 --> 03:11:55.005]  endorsement hit and just crushed all momentum.
[03:11:55.406 --> 03:11:56.506]  Never seen anything like it.
[03:11:56.866 --> 03:12:01.088]  And kudos to the Trump campaign because that was executed politically perfectly.
[03:12:01.947 --> 03:12:03.987]  And it crushed the DNC momentum.
[03:12:04.348 --> 03:12:05.588]  It shifted the narrative.
[03:12:05.848 --> 03:12:09.749]  The news cycle became about Trump, RFK Jr.
[03:12:10.089 --> 03:12:12.549]  That totally deflated their momentum entirely.
[03:12:13.489 --> 03:12:21.831]  And apparently the next big thing after that was supposed to be this tag team interview with Kamala Harris and her little emotional support animal, tampon Tim Walz.
[03:12:23.091 --> 03:12:25.392]  And that caused even more of a deflation.
[03:12:26.405 --> 03:12:27.146]  They looked worse.
[03:12:27.306 --> 03:12:29.708]  Tim was continuing to lie about his stolen valor.
[03:12:30.168 --> 03:12:31.129]  He looked like it too.
[03:12:31.149 --> 03:12:32.370]  Did you guys see his body language?
[03:12:32.750 --> 03:12:37.314]  Closed his eyes, looked down, and lied directly to the camera because he knows he's a liar.
[03:12:37.715 --> 03:12:40.637]  He knows he's lying in the face of millions of veterans out there.
[03:12:40.697 --> 03:12:42.318]  He knows that they know.
[03:12:42.619 --> 03:12:44.120]  He knows that we know.
[03:12:45.501 --> 03:12:47.323]  And Kamala Harris, just a total train wreck.
[03:12:48.063 --> 03:12:49.905]  She went triple speak during that interview.
[03:12:49.925 --> 03:12:51.506]  That's what I've been saying.
[03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:54.829]  There's double speak, but then Kamala has triple, quadruple speak.
[03:12:55.362 --> 03:12:59.526]  It's like you said in 2019, 2020 that you are in favor of banning fracking.
[03:12:59.827 --> 03:13:00.828]  Now you're saying not.
[03:13:01.589 --> 03:13:02.269]  So what is it?
[03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:06.734]  Well, I am, you know, I'm drunk right now.
[03:13:07.355 --> 03:13:08.736]  I'm drunk and on Xanax.
[03:13:09.457 --> 03:13:12.460]  But, you know, yeah, I said that.
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:15.523]  But now I'm not in favor of banning fracking.
[03:13:15.563 --> 03:13:17.405]  But my values haven't changed.
[03:13:19.814 --> 03:13:20.615]  It's like what?
[03:13:20.655 --> 03:13:22.136]  That's like triple speak.
[03:13:22.176 --> 03:13:23.417]  I think it's meant to give you a headache.
[03:13:23.437 --> 03:13:24.378]  She has a carousel.
[03:13:24.418 --> 03:13:26.740]  She's got a merry-go-round in her mind.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:38.830]  And when you ask her questions, even if you give her multiple choice options to answer with, the mind just spits out via merry-go-round multiple answers, and it doesn't make any sense.
[03:13:39.810 --> 03:13:42.412]  Yeah, that interview was bad, and you guys know that.
[03:13:43.233 --> 03:13:45.375]  And so it leads me to what happened yesterday.
[03:13:47.356 --> 03:13:49.997]  Democrats, the Harris campaign have nothing.
[03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:53.039]  They have absolutely nothing.
[03:13:54.060 --> 03:13:56.021]  And they went with another indictment.
[03:13:56.261 --> 03:14:00.063]  It only gave Trump another boost in the polls or the betting markets.
[03:14:00.163 --> 03:14:01.864]  I don't really trust them at all.
[03:14:02.584 --> 03:14:04.225]  But it's interesting to see that momentum.
[03:14:04.645 --> 03:14:06.746]  I don't base my voting opinion on that.
[03:14:06.966 --> 03:14:11.309]  I just like to study them, look at them, but I do not trust them at all.
[03:14:12.809 --> 03:14:14.110]  But it gave Trump a boost.
[03:14:14.170 --> 03:14:15.651]  It gave Trump some more momentum.
[03:14:16.545 --> 03:14:24.090]  He's been gaining that back ever since the Kamala coup was initiated and launched and the Kamala Syop was initiated and launched.
[03:14:25.591 --> 03:14:27.272]  And they've been completely deflated.
[03:14:27.772 --> 03:14:35.957]  If you guys have noticed, all of Kamala's rallies, she's in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, everywhere she's going, she's got these tiny little rallies now.
[03:14:36.117 --> 03:14:41.000]  She's literally telling her attendees not to pay attention to the polls now.
[03:14:41.949 --> 03:14:42.930]  She doesn't look confident.
[03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.811]  She looks horrible.
[03:14:44.031 --> 03:14:47.314]  Looks like she's aged 10 years since the DNC.
[03:14:47.434 --> 03:14:48.234]  She's an alcoholic.
[03:14:48.254 --> 03:14:49.536]  She's probably a drug addict.
[03:14:50.657 --> 03:14:54.019]  But I will tell you for sure, she doesn't look as confident as she once did.
[03:14:54.039 --> 03:15:00.325]  However, after yesterday's mass shooting, I will say this, she kind of looks like she's confident again.
[03:15:00.345 --> 03:15:03.728]  And I will dive into just exactly
[03:15:04.611 --> 03:15:14.317]  What I'm running through my mind as I see this and I war game this in my mind and I kind of analyze where I think things are going, especially if Trump wins.
[03:15:14.577 --> 03:15:23.923]  We're going to really talk about that because the DOJ Biden administration officially came out and resurrected the Russian collusion narrative 2.0 again yesterday.
[03:15:24.264 --> 03:15:24.924]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:24.964 --> 03:15:25.484]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:25.524 --> 03:15:26.005]  Share the links.
[03:15:31.604 --> 03:15:38.649]  First of all, we want to avoid the middle of the grocery store and stick to whole foods, real food.
[03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:44.353]  But these days, even the real food is short of its nutrient potential.
[03:15:45.273 --> 03:15:50.037]  And this is why it's important to take a vitamin mineral supplement every day.
[03:15:51.337 --> 03:15:59.863]  According to studies, regular multivitamin mineral supplement use reduces the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.
[03:16:01.625 --> 03:16:12.374]  Perhaps supplements aren't important to you, but in today's upside-down world, a daily vitamin mineral supplement is a must, and we have one of the best.
[03:16:13.135 --> 03:16:16.097]  Support your health and support the InfoWar.
[03:16:16.718 --> 03:16:21.182]  Get your vitamin mineral fusion today at InfoWarStore.com.

[03:16:31.556 --> 03:16:33.397]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.

[03:16:51.003 --> 03:16:52.544]  Share it immediately when you see the intel.
[03:16:53.484 --> 03:16:57.287]  And so back to this conversation of where the Harris campaign is right now.
[03:16:57.307 --> 03:17:03.551]  It makes sense to me that you're gonna start to see some destabilizing events.
[03:17:06.333 --> 03:17:10.556]  Especially when her momentum has completely deflated, has completely died out.
[03:17:11.717 --> 03:17:14.158]  And honestly, I don't think she's gonna debate Trump next week.
[03:17:14.419 --> 03:17:15.119]  I really don't.
[03:17:15.620 --> 03:17:20.343]  I mean, don't be surprised if they come out and say, she got COVID over the weekend.
[03:17:21.568 --> 03:17:25.591]  Monday morning, the day before the debate, and Tim Walz.
[03:17:25.631 --> 03:17:33.495]  They both got, Kamala Harris got COVID, and we don't know how, but Tim Walz has monkey pox.
[03:17:34.235 --> 03:17:39.458]  Huge mystery, huge, huge mystery, huge mystery.
[03:17:39.478 --> 03:17:42.380]  Yeah, nobody would be surprised about that.
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:47.863]  But don't be surprised if they pull out of the debate before Tuesday.
[03:17:48.570 --> 03:17:50.812]  Cuz it doesn't benefit them at all.
[03:17:50.832 --> 03:17:52.273]  It doesn't benefit Kamala.
[03:17:52.313 --> 03:17:53.795]  It doesn't benefit the campaign.
[03:17:54.195 --> 03:17:55.616]  It doesn't benefit Democrats.
[03:17:56.737 --> 03:17:57.798]  That's why they've been hiding her.
[03:17:58.138 --> 03:18:04.684]  They got her stuffing her ears with headphones so she doesn't have to listen to the media.
[03:18:04.704 --> 03:18:08.848]  Yeah, when she's boarding Air Force Two on the tarmac.
[03:18:09.994 --> 03:18:23.119]  That's why Tim Walz, when he's interacting with voters on the campaign trail, and anyone with a phone, anybody, it doesn't even have to be someone that works for a media company, you just walk up, hey, Tim, how's your day?
[03:18:23.139 --> 03:18:24.420]  And he just scurries away.
[03:18:25.240 --> 03:18:27.221]  He literally scurries away.
[03:18:27.261 --> 03:18:28.701]  He's like Roadrunner, just takes off.
[03:18:28.741 --> 03:18:30.602]  That guy is not wanting to talk to anybody.
[03:18:30.862 --> 03:18:32.483]  Well, their handlers aren't allowing them.
[03:18:33.043 --> 03:18:35.704]  So with all the deflation right now,
[03:18:36.511 --> 03:18:40.234]  With this campaign, they are just totally empty.
[03:18:41.315 --> 03:18:43.497]  All wind has been taken out of their sails.
[03:18:44.378 --> 03:18:46.380]  And so I think they will result to false flags.
[03:18:47.321 --> 03:18:55.468]  I think they will result to deep state ops being run on the American public, taking advantage of people, using people as pawns.
[03:18:56.112 --> 03:18:56.772]  I think it's horrible.
[03:18:56.812 --> 03:19:10.501]  I think it's sad, especially when you hear yesterday and the Georgia high school school shooting, that the FBI knew about this kid a year before, and there were phone calls the morning of, warning of a school shooting, and nothing happened?
[03:19:11.762 --> 03:19:12.262]  Interesting.
[03:19:12.682 --> 03:19:16.785]  If I'm one of the parents, I want to know, why was there no warning?
[03:19:17.045 --> 03:19:18.466]  Why was nothing done?
[03:19:18.566 --> 03:19:20.187]  Why was this allowed to happen?
[03:19:20.831 --> 03:19:22.933]  I ask these questions because I care about the kids.
[03:19:23.573 --> 03:19:26.295]  I ask these questions because I care about the parents.
[03:19:26.355 --> 03:19:29.017]  This should not have happened this way.
[03:19:30.138 --> 03:19:33.460]  And it makes you wonder, is the FBI admitting failure?
[03:19:35.862 --> 03:19:43.588]  Is the mainstream media like CNN reporting on these failures of law enforcement to further create a narrative that
[03:19:44.438 --> 03:19:51.124]  Justifies and leads one to conclude, not you or I, but like some, you know, retard NPC normie out there.
[03:19:52.265 --> 03:19:55.068]  Is it meant to lead one psychologically to conclude?
[03:19:55.108 --> 03:19:57.130]  Well, law enforcement couldn't do anything.
[03:19:57.150 --> 03:20:00.113]  The school didn't do anything.
[03:20:00.733 --> 03:20:04.797]  All of these safeguards were put in place and that wasn't enough.
[03:20:05.783 --> 03:20:07.764]  We need gun control.
[03:20:08.244 --> 03:20:11.086]  It was the gun's fault at the end of the day.
[03:20:11.446 --> 03:20:15.528]  We tried everything and the problem was the gun.
[03:20:16.988 --> 03:20:20.390]  Maybe, maybe, that's just my own personal opinion.
[03:20:21.530 --> 03:20:22.091]  But we'll see.
[03:20:22.291 --> 03:20:26.333]  But what I do know is that Democrats never let a good crisis go to waste, man.
[03:20:26.373 --> 03:20:29.614]  They politicized it within two hours yesterday.
[03:20:30.755 --> 03:20:33.236]  Because this campaign is deflated and has nothing.
[03:20:35.074 --> 03:20:38.215]  Every time they indict Trump, it just gives them a boost.
[03:20:38.255 --> 03:20:38.835]  It's not working.
[03:20:38.855 --> 03:20:40.195]  That's why they tried to kill him.
[03:20:40.215 --> 03:20:41.215]  They'll probably try again.
[03:20:41.235 --> 03:20:47.516]  And Trump is going to be sentenced in a few days.
[03:20:48.696 --> 03:20:51.577]  And everybody's asking, where is that going to take us?
[03:20:51.657 --> 03:20:54.437]  Are they actually going to put him in a jail cell, try to kill him in jail?
[03:20:54.457 --> 03:21:00.078]  Are they going to put him on house arrest to disable him from being on the campaign trail?
[03:21:00.819 --> 03:21:03.199]  All you'll have is JD Vance and America First
[03:21:04.568 --> 03:21:07.189]  Allies or operatives on the campaign trail.
[03:21:07.209 --> 03:21:09.750]  It'll only give him a further boost.
[03:21:10.450 --> 03:21:15.032]  What I do know is they do want a civil war, civil unrest scenario.
[03:21:15.352 --> 03:21:17.793]  And not like peaceful civil unrest, peaceful protesting.
[03:21:17.813 --> 03:21:28.456]  What I mean is like full-blown rules for radicals, Saul Alinsky type polarized groups and civilization killing each other.
[03:21:29.136 --> 03:21:30.137]  They've been wanting that.
[03:21:30.157 --> 03:21:33.398]  I think, I mean, I don't think, I think it's pretty clear they wanted that.
[03:21:34.625 --> 03:21:39.529]  After the attempted assassination of President Trump, they really did want that.
[03:21:40.290 --> 03:21:48.057]  And honestly, I think a attempted assassination, I'm not calling for this, but I mean, the deep state could roll this as well.
[03:21:48.837 --> 03:21:53.481]  On Kamala Harris, could happen as well, a deep state assassination attempt on Kamala Harris.
[03:21:53.641 --> 03:21:56.524]  I mean, that would be, jeez.
[03:21:57.865 --> 03:22:01.128]  I mean, in my opinion, I think the Trump campaign failed miserably.
[03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:08.684]  To take J-13 and just campaign on that till November?
[03:22:09.424 --> 03:22:13.027]  Make Trump America's martyr, right, on top of everything else?
[03:22:13.047 --> 03:22:14.728]  That's just me.
[03:22:15.028 --> 03:22:15.688]  That's just me.
[03:22:16.009 --> 03:22:17.710]  And I'll ask you this.
[03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:21.252]  Can you imagine if what happened to Trump happened to Kamala Harris?
[03:22:23.013 --> 03:22:25.335]  They would have written a book within a month.
[03:22:26.175 --> 03:22:26.956]  They would have
[03:22:27.873 --> 03:22:40.881]  Produced a Netflix series, a Hulu series, an HBO Max documentary within two months, and a movie would have been released probably by this Friday.
[03:22:41.441 --> 03:22:45.324]  And they would have never let it go until the end of time.
[03:22:46.324 --> 03:22:47.465]  You and I know that.
[03:22:47.805 --> 03:22:55.050]  They would have branded that, they would have campaigned on it, and they would have kept it in the psyche of millions of people until the end of time.
[03:22:56.115 --> 03:22:59.497]  And I think the Trump campaign should have done that as well, cuz it actually happened.
[03:23:00.217 --> 03:23:02.739]  But anyways, the Harris campaign is desperate.
[03:23:02.779 --> 03:23:03.879]  Trump has the momentum.
[03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:07.502]  And so it's leading them to desperation.
[03:23:07.582 --> 03:23:09.943]  And in their desperation, it makes them extremely dangerous.
[03:23:10.003 --> 03:23:11.184]  You know this, I know this.
[03:23:12.284 --> 03:23:12.925]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:23:13.245 --> 03:23:14.345]  I could be wrong.
[03:23:14.385 --> 03:23:15.286]  I could be totally wrong.
[03:23:15.366 --> 03:23:18.808]  I don't think she's gonna debate Trump next week cuz it doesn't benefit them.
[03:23:19.634 --> 03:23:27.477]  Maybe, just maybe, after what happened yesterday in Georgia, in a swing state, now they got something conveniently.
[03:23:28.737 --> 03:23:39.861]  They already politicized it within a couple hours, and maybe now they got something to really bring up in the debate to pin against Trump.
[03:23:40.001 --> 03:23:43.442]  But still, it's too risky.
[03:23:43.482 --> 03:23:45.983]  They're not taking any chances with her, any chances.
[03:23:47.392 --> 03:23:51.456]  And of course, this is all in the context of a free and fair election scenario.
[03:23:51.896 --> 03:23:52.677]  Will we get that?
[03:23:52.897 --> 03:23:53.998]  I honestly do not know.
[03:23:54.098 --> 03:23:54.558]  We'll see.
[03:23:54.899 --> 03:23:55.439]  We will see.
[03:23:56.220 --> 03:23:59.823]  Will the too-big-to-rig theory end up being correct is the big question.
[03:24:00.784 --> 03:24:01.504]  I can't tell you.
[03:24:01.665 --> 03:24:02.485]  Yes, it will be.
[03:24:02.505 --> 03:24:03.166]  I can't.
[03:24:04.247 --> 03:24:06.549]  It's kind of just like, we'll see.
[03:24:08.631 --> 03:24:11.033]  But also, this brings me to what happened yesterday.
[03:24:11.153 --> 03:24:13.255]  And I think I first said this
[03:24:14.522 --> 03:24:25.671]  Man, maybe a couple years ago here on the Alex Jones Show, I can't remember when, or I know I've been saying it on my show, but I have been proposing the scenario where maybe they let Trump win.
[03:24:27.673 --> 03:24:30.015]  And in a sense, they kind of rig it for Trump.
[03:24:31.476 --> 03:24:40.263]  And then when Trump wins, they roll out the resurrect the Russian collusion narrative yet again.
[03:24:42.409 --> 03:24:47.530]  And I've been thinking about this for the past couple years and it almost kind of makes sense.
[03:24:48.251 --> 03:25:00.594]  It almost kind of makes sense because I don't think Kamala Harris would certify the election and then people will say, well, they changed the law to where it has to be certified because they thought Mike Pence wasn't going to follow through like a good boy.
[03:25:00.614 --> 03:25:04.775]  Yeah, Democrats follow laws, right?
[03:25:05.135 --> 03:25:06.796]  They're held accountable to laws.
[03:25:06.836 --> 03:25:11.417]  These people view themselves as God, lawmakers, rewriters.
[03:25:12.267 --> 03:25:16.851]  Chameleons, they do as thou wilt whenever they want, however they want.
[03:25:18.152 --> 03:25:24.458]  And honestly, if we get a Trump W in November, Kamala Harris, they will not certify the election.
[03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:27.921]  They will not leave the White House.
[03:25:29.823 --> 03:25:32.766]  And after yesterday, it came to fruition.
[03:25:32.786 --> 03:25:34.668]  I was tripping out, yes, I really was.
[03:25:36.029 --> 03:25:37.851]  Attorney General Merrick Garland,
[03:25:39.131 --> 03:25:43.694]  FBI Director Christopher Wray held a 30-minute, about an hour press conference yesterday.
[03:25:43.834 --> 03:25:45.175]  Pretty sure Alex talked about this.
[03:25:47.857 --> 03:25:53.000]  And in unison, and the whole thing going on with Tenet Media and RT, right?
[03:25:53.401 --> 03:26:01.926]  In unison, Russians are already attempting to interfere with US elections and the outcome in November.
[03:26:02.046 --> 03:26:05.348]  Now, everybody knows it's not gonna be for Kamala.
[03:26:05.468 --> 03:26:07.650]  In their mind, they mean it's for Trump.
[03:26:08.396 --> 03:26:17.359]  And he listed all these examples of election, I watched the full press conference on my show yesterday and it was very interesting.
[03:26:17.959 --> 03:26:23.021]  Alex always tells you, listen to what they say, read what they say, that's where they're going.
[03:26:23.982 --> 03:26:27.143]  It's easy to predict that way and analyze.
[03:26:27.563 --> 03:26:33.605]  And I was doing that last night and Merrick Garland lists fear mongers, lists this poll worker was threatened.
[03:26:34.426 --> 03:26:36.427]  This poll worker was threatened in Arizona.
[03:26:36.487 --> 03:26:41.028]  This poll worker was threatened their family and their children, that they're gonna kill them if they don't do what they want.
[03:26:42.849 --> 03:26:48.311]  And they rolled out this task force where we're gonna make sure that we protect the poll workers.
[03:26:49.311 --> 03:26:54.653]  They are sacred to the protection of our democracy and our election process.
[03:26:55.153 --> 03:26:57.774]  And literally, you can see the clip on my ex, Andrew H. Live.
[03:26:57.914 --> 03:27:00.275]  Merrick Garland announced that the FBI
[03:27:01.605 --> 03:27:03.586]  After the election, it's crazy.
[03:27:04.126 --> 03:27:24.331]  Apparently the FBI, with their federal partners at their headquarters, they will have a press conference to debrief and detail all of the criminality and criminal activity that took place on election day or night, the day after.
[03:27:25.772 --> 03:27:27.772]  So they're preparing for something, man.
[03:27:27.792 --> 03:27:28.533]  They really are.
[03:27:29.033 --> 03:27:30.133]  And then he went on to say,
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:39.202]  He went on to say that they will be opposing everyone that poses a violent threat to election poll workers.
[03:27:40.862 --> 03:27:45.163]  And so the first thing I'll say is, I'm not calling for this in any way, shape or form.
[03:27:45.663 --> 03:27:48.664]  In context of what I'm about to say, I am not calling for this.
[03:27:49.144 --> 03:27:50.924]  Actually, I call for the opposite.
[03:27:53.945 --> 03:27:58.486]  Nobody within MAGA, nobody within the right wing is gonna bomb an election center.
[03:27:59.537 --> 03:28:01.938]  Is going to shoot up a polling center.
[03:28:02.818 --> 03:28:10.219]  Nobody within the right wing is going to show up threatening to kill people or shoot people on election day when people are voting.
[03:28:10.679 --> 03:28:13.680]  All right, I'm going to call for that right now, right now.
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:15.180]  Because you know what?
[03:28:15.340 --> 03:28:20.442]  It looks like they're going to try to set up a narrative for the deep state via false flag.
[03:28:21.562 --> 03:28:27.123]  Just dress some dude up with a MAGA hat on to show up and bomb a polling center, okay?
[03:28:28.195 --> 03:28:31.037]  Or a voting center, attack on poll workers.
[03:28:31.317 --> 03:28:41.342]  And they're already saying that the day after the election, we're gonna have a press conference with the FBI at their headquarters to debrief everyone on all the criminal violent activity that took place on election day and night.
[03:28:42.443 --> 03:28:43.883]  So be on the lookout for that.
[03:28:45.684 --> 03:28:50.727]  Be on the lookout for that because that kind of sounds like where they're taking us.
[03:28:51.608 --> 03:28:56.252]  On top of, and I'm not calling for that, I'm just saying they might take us there.
[03:28:56.512 --> 03:28:57.152]  Look what they did on 9-11.
[03:28:57.192 --> 03:28:59.634]  You know what I mean?
[03:29:00.155 --> 03:29:01.536]  They do this, okay?
[03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:18.769]  And then on top of that, you have FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing yesterday that Russian disinformation agents are already attempting to influence and meddle in the 2024 election via RT.
[03:29:21.986 --> 03:29:34.931]  Via an indictment that was rolled out to Tenet Media, where you got Tim Pool, you got Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin, reporter Taylor Hanson, Lauren Chen, and her husband all involved, right?
[03:29:35.231 --> 03:29:37.672]  Which I think was probably a setup, honestly.
[03:29:38.572 --> 03:29:39.573]  Sounds like a setup to me.
[03:29:40.273 --> 03:29:42.654]  If I'm completely honest, it sounds like they were all set up.
[03:29:43.254 --> 03:29:44.675]  Sounds like they were all set up.
[03:29:44.695 --> 03:29:47.996]  I mean, how do we know that these two Russian agents
[03:29:48.809 --> 03:29:52.391]  That we're funneling, you know, deceitfully money to tenant media.
[03:29:52.411 --> 03:29:53.792]  How do we know that's not CIA?
[03:29:54.253 --> 03:29:55.013]  Who are those agents?
[03:29:55.073 --> 03:29:56.034]  Who are those agents?
[03:29:56.674 --> 03:29:58.055]  You know what I mean?
[03:29:58.075 --> 03:30:00.237]  But if it was Israel, oh, you'd be praised.
[03:30:00.297 --> 03:30:01.657]  You'd get a parade.
[03:30:01.677 --> 03:30:04.119]  You know what I mean?
[03:30:04.219 --> 03:30:07.521]  You would get a parade if you were taking money from Israel.
[03:30:08.542 --> 03:30:11.444]  CCP, they might give you a slap on the wrist, but you know.
[03:30:13.578 --> 03:30:15.379]  But if it's Israel, no, you get a parade.
[03:30:16.539 --> 03:30:17.400]  You get a parade.
[03:30:18.140 --> 03:30:26.264]  Just ask all the, you know, ask all the ConInk media activist companies where all their money's coming from, but that's okay, huh?
[03:30:27.424 --> 03:30:29.205]  Oh yeah, yeah, that's not foreign anymore.
[03:30:29.385 --> 03:30:30.425]  That's just our ally.
[03:30:31.106 --> 03:30:31.766]  Bunch of crap.
[03:30:32.226 --> 03:30:33.727]  But anyways, I think they were set up.
[03:30:33.807 --> 03:30:35.047]  This is what the CIA does.
[03:30:35.107 --> 03:30:36.868]  This is what intelligence agencies do.
[03:30:37.388 --> 03:30:39.329]  However, it's installing a narrative.
[03:30:39.409 --> 03:30:40.810]  It's like setting the groundwork
[03:30:41.445 --> 03:30:44.346]  It's preemptively predictive programming, right?
[03:30:45.907 --> 03:30:51.469]  Setting psychologically the narrative for when you see it executed.
[03:30:52.850 --> 03:30:54.791]  And I've been saying this is probably going to happen.
[03:30:55.091 --> 03:30:57.372]  They might just call off the rigors.
[03:30:57.532 --> 03:30:59.353]  They might just call off all the election.
[03:31:00.211 --> 03:31:14.564]  Riot rigging, let Trump win, say it, Russia, we've already been, we've been telling you guys, we told you, Attorney General Merrick Garland told you, FBI Director Christopher Wray told you in September, remember?
[03:31:14.924 --> 03:31:18.027]  He told you this was already, remember Tenet Media?
[03:31:18.327 --> 03:31:19.228]  Remember that?
[03:31:19.648 --> 03:31:20.209]  Remember?
[03:31:23.277 --> 03:31:31.820]  The reason why I think they were set up is, you know, let's just be honest, you know, tenant media, not, not, not considered like right wing, hardcore based.
[03:31:32.000 --> 03:31:32.640]  You know what I mean?
[03:31:33.361 --> 03:31:34.201]  Let's just be honest.
[03:31:34.661 --> 03:31:35.301]  Let's be honest.
[03:31:35.521 --> 03:31:37.942]  So when you see that, you're like, yeah, it looks like they were set up.
[03:31:38.442 --> 03:31:39.903]  Looks like they were set up.
[03:31:39.943 --> 03:31:47.846]  You'd think they would really go for some like real hard right wing hitting type of content creators and show hosts.
[03:31:47.886 --> 03:31:48.346]  You know what I mean?
[03:31:48.586 --> 03:31:51.487]  But maybe, maybe, maybe those types of individuals are too smart.
[03:31:52.865 --> 03:31:55.566]  You know, like to be able to see that from a mile away.
[03:31:55.586 --> 03:32:01.748]  Because listen, man, I have come across stuff within media where it's like, yeah, this stuff gets pretty crazy.
[03:32:02.149 --> 03:32:03.169]  It gets really shady.
[03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:06.170]  You guys have seen what's happened with Infowars.
[03:32:07.491 --> 03:32:13.353]  And a lot of big money gets thrown around and you really got to be careful where that money is coming from.
[03:32:13.733 --> 03:32:16.674]  The CIA, they will set you up.
[03:32:17.327 --> 03:32:20.829]  They will set you up like like a sting operation, you know what I mean?
[03:32:21.190 --> 03:32:28.615]  Like when you're catching a pedophile or a drug bust, the sting operations, what they do, like the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot.
[03:32:29.055 --> 03:32:30.376]  FBI set them up.
[03:32:30.416 --> 03:32:30.996]  They set them up.
[03:32:32.037 --> 03:32:32.678]  That's what they do.
[03:32:34.519 --> 03:32:40.743]  So it's no surprise, and it leads me to see kind of looking at, you know, the 10,000 view.
[03:32:41.884 --> 03:32:44.686]  You know, bird's eye view looking down.
[03:32:45.834 --> 03:32:48.896]  That they're definitely setting up this narrative and it's possible.
[03:32:49.276 --> 03:32:56.719]  It's possible they may be setting up preemptively for a Trump win that they can't control, or they may let Trump win.
[03:32:57.420 --> 03:33:01.022]  Either way, it's possible they're not going to accept the results.
[03:33:01.482 --> 03:33:07.125]  And I think that would produce, this is why I'm kind of leaning towards down this scenario.
[03:33:07.145 --> 03:33:10.426]  Because if they rig the election, they steal it.
[03:33:12.147 --> 03:33:13.728]  There's not going to be a violent uprising.
[03:33:14.890 --> 03:33:15.671]  And I think they know it.
[03:33:16.191 --> 03:33:17.352]  Look at the right wing right now.
[03:33:17.672 --> 03:33:23.537]  You literally have right wing ex-influencers, all up and down ex, begging Mike Johnson.
[03:33:23.997 --> 03:33:26.139]  Mike Johnson, I know you're on vacation.
[03:33:26.199 --> 03:33:30.623]  Please, please, Rhino GOP, please, we're about to lose the republic.
[03:33:30.663 --> 03:33:32.004]  We're two months away.
[03:33:32.024 --> 03:33:36.868]  I know you're on vacation, but when you guys come back, please, Mike Johnson.
[03:33:37.568 --> 03:33:41.191]  Attach the SAVE Act to the September spending bill!
[03:33:41.651 --> 03:33:43.712]  We're begging you, please!
[03:33:44.112 --> 03:33:48.735]  Like a bunch of Venezuelan beggars begging for some basic necessities.
[03:33:49.135 --> 03:33:51.397]  Please, can you guys secure our election?
[03:33:51.517 --> 03:33:54.579]  Please, can you make it so illegals can't vote?
[03:33:55.039 --> 03:33:56.660]  Please, we're begging you!
[03:33:57.541 --> 03:33:58.341]  Pathetic!
[03:33:58.902 --> 03:34:00.943]  Not gonna find me begging Mike Johnson.
[03:34:00.963 --> 03:34:02.544]  That should have been done four years ago.
[03:34:04.252 --> 03:34:07.635]  Two and a half years ago at the least before the 2022 midterms.
[03:34:08.215 --> 03:34:09.877]  Yeah, that's where the right wing is right now.
[03:34:10.157 --> 03:34:14.941]  So I'm not anticipating some violent uprising if they steal this upcoming election.
[03:34:15.161 --> 03:34:21.506]  However, they may launch it themselves.
[03:34:22.487 --> 03:34:25.909]  And the scenario I'm looking at, I might be totally wrong about this.
[03:34:27.230 --> 03:34:31.634]  But it sounds like they could potentially get their civil war scenario if they let Trump win.
[03:34:32.555 --> 03:34:35.637]  And don't let him into the White House and do not certify the election.
[03:34:35.917 --> 03:34:45.284]  Where we go from there because Jamie Raskin has already been talking about disqualifying Trump if he wins early January of 2025.
[03:34:45.624 --> 03:34:49.947]  They have multiple plans already to keep him out of the White House.
[03:34:50.788 --> 03:34:52.349]  They've openly been talking about this.
[03:34:52.529 --> 03:34:53.710]  Alex has been talking about it.
[03:34:53.790 --> 03:34:55.671]  Everyone on InfoWars has been talking about it.
[03:34:56.599 --> 03:34:58.821]  And where we go from there, I don't know.
[03:34:58.841 --> 03:35:04.765]  It seems like the right wing isn't even trying to consider or entertain the possibility of this scenario.
[03:35:05.426 --> 03:35:09.309]  If Trump wins, AGOP, what's the plan?
[03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:22.579]  If Trump wins and they say the election results are illegitimate and they're false, Kamala Harris does not, Democrats, they do not certify the election.
[03:35:22.639 --> 03:35:23.460]  They withhold.
[03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:24.581]  Will Congress act?
[03:35:26.442 --> 03:35:27.742]  Will the Supreme Court act?
[03:35:29.162 --> 03:35:30.083]  These are the big questions.
[03:35:31.403 --> 03:35:33.923]  Because I will tell you, they are not going to leave the White House.
[03:35:34.183 --> 03:35:34.683]  I don't see it.
[03:35:34.723 --> 03:35:35.544]  I'll be shocked.
[03:35:36.164 --> 03:35:37.704]  I'll be absolutely shocked.
[03:35:37.764 --> 03:35:43.145]  But I'm not holding my breath for rhino GOP Republicans to hold the line, dude.
[03:35:43.865 --> 03:35:45.505]  Come on, honestly.
[03:35:46.045 --> 03:35:46.646]  They hate Trump.
[03:35:46.666 --> 03:35:47.446]  They want Trump out.
[03:35:47.606 --> 03:35:48.186]  They hate you.
[03:35:48.246 --> 03:35:48.906]  They want us out.
[03:35:48.926 --> 03:35:50.606]  That's why they call us MAGA Republicans.
[03:35:50.806 --> 03:35:54.987]  That's why you got Mitt Romney and you got all these rhinos up there, Adam Kissinger.
[03:35:55.834 --> 03:36:05.727]  Yeah, there's a certain part, there's a certain deplorable part of the Republican Party that is about to leave, right?
[03:36:06.809 --> 03:36:07.510]  That's you, that's me.
[03:36:08.010 --> 03:36:09.853]  And if you are a RFK Jr.
[03:36:09.893 --> 03:36:12.897]  supporter and you've joined MAGA, that's you too, okay?
[03:36:13.883 --> 03:36:27.147]  And so I see this kind of giving them that Civil War scenario, mass destabilizing event in the United States of America that they, I think, tried to accomplish on J13 of July 13, 2024.
[03:36:27.287 --> 03:36:30.388]  I could be totally wrong.
[03:36:30.988 --> 03:36:33.569]  But one thing I do know is that Democrats do not follow laws.
[03:36:34.009 --> 03:36:35.810]  They are not held accountable to laws.
[03:36:36.270 --> 03:36:38.531]  They rewrite the laws when it's convenient.
[03:36:39.031 --> 03:36:42.012]  They do as thou wilt whenever they want.
[03:36:43.425 --> 03:36:46.551]  And so yeah, maybe the too big to rig theory could be correct.
[03:36:47.152 --> 03:36:49.676]  But my big question is, will they certify the election?
[03:36:50.117 --> 03:36:53.102]  Will Joe Biden and Kamala Harris leave the White House?
[03:36:53.462 --> 03:36:55.386]  Or will they just have their own inauguration?
[03:36:56.351 --> 03:36:59.693]  Just they already had their own inauguration.
[03:36:59.833 --> 03:37:01.715]  They already stole the election.
[03:37:01.955 --> 03:37:03.896]  They already have a rogue government.
[03:37:04.316 --> 03:37:04.997]  What do you mean?
[03:37:05.297 --> 03:37:06.818]  Well, I don't know if they would try that.
[03:37:06.878 --> 03:37:08.359]  They've already done it, dude.
[03:37:08.619 --> 03:37:10.200]  They're just gonna keep it going.
[03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:12.041]  They're just gonna keep it going.
[03:37:12.481 --> 03:37:14.083]  And they want mass chaos.
[03:37:14.123 --> 03:37:16.004]  They want a civil war scenario.
[03:37:16.424 --> 03:37:19.606]  They want an uprising of violence.
[03:37:20.967 --> 03:37:22.368]  Because then they'll really crack down.
[03:37:23.780 --> 03:37:38.586]  And so just, you know, not as a show host, you know, I have the honor and the privilege to host the Alex Jones Show on Thursdays during the fourth hour, whenever Alex isn't, you know, doing the full four hour duty of the show.
[03:37:38.606 --> 03:37:45.848]  And I host my own show, which by the way, you can find me rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez, rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:37:45.908 --> 03:37:47.149]  I go live Monday through Friday.
[03:37:48.248 --> 03:37:48.808]  At 6 p.m.
[03:37:48.848 --> 03:37:49.789]  Pacific, 9 p.m.
[03:37:49.889 --> 03:37:53.970]  Eastern, I am going live tonight covering part two of the Trump Town Hall.
[03:37:54.570 --> 03:37:55.531]  So we would love to have you.
[03:37:55.551 --> 03:37:56.691]  It's like InfoWars at night.
[03:37:58.672 --> 03:38:03.914]  I'm not only saying this as a show host or someone on X that has somewhat of a presence.
[03:38:03.934 --> 03:38:07.075]  You can find me there as well, x.com slash Drew H. Live.
[03:38:07.135 --> 03:38:08.495]  Follow me now, share the links.
[03:38:09.596 --> 03:38:15.858]  But I just say this as a voter, as an American, as an observer, someone really
[03:38:16.693 --> 03:38:19.835]  Just watching the direction that the current is going in.
[03:38:21.116 --> 03:38:30.241]  And I see these so-called leaders, the GOP and obviously the Democrat Party, it's the unit party, really just going with the flow, going with the current.
[03:38:31.221 --> 03:38:42.588]  No, they haven't been working on the SAVE Act to ensure it will be enacted upon before this imperative election that's gonna decide the fate of the Republic.
[03:38:42.648 --> 03:38:45.770]  No, no, they've, what has the GOP been more concerned with?
[03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:58.445]  Giving billions of dollars to Israel, and billions of dollars to Ukraine, and billions of dollars to Gaza and Palestine, and cutting deals with Iran.
[03:38:58.946 --> 03:39:00.126]  That's what we care about.
[03:39:00.146 --> 03:39:02.207]  Yeah, it's been America last.
[03:39:02.227 --> 03:39:03.648]  That's what we've been telling you.
[03:39:04.568 --> 03:39:06.469]  America last until you die.
[03:39:06.489 --> 03:39:09.770]  That's what the replacement migration operation is.
[03:39:09.790 --> 03:39:12.231]  They'll continue to see these illegal aliens.
[03:39:12.552 --> 03:39:12.992]  They're here.
[03:39:13.032 --> 03:39:13.592]  It's not coming.
[03:39:13.852 --> 03:39:15.193]  There are probably over 20 million
[03:39:16.471 --> 03:39:24.214]  That have been imported since Biden was installed, plus the tens of millions that are already here to begin with.
[03:39:25.015 --> 03:39:26.455]  They haven't been activated yet.
[03:39:27.756 --> 03:39:28.276]  They will.
[03:39:28.977 --> 03:39:30.477]  And when that happens, be ready.
[03:39:30.577 --> 03:39:31.978]  Look what's happened in the UK.
[03:39:31.998 --> 03:39:34.739]  You guys have seen what's been happening.
[03:39:34.899 --> 03:39:37.760]  Tommy Robinson has been reporting on what's been happening.
[03:39:38.161 --> 03:39:38.941]  Look at France.
[03:39:39.521 --> 03:39:40.342]  Look at Germany.
[03:39:40.762 --> 03:39:42.703]  Just look at Europe for the past 10 years.
[03:39:44.511 --> 03:39:47.052]  Doesn't even, you can't even recognize it anymore.
[03:39:47.672 --> 03:39:54.213]  Violent, illegal aliens attacking, raping women, children, fathers, grandfathers.
[03:39:54.493 --> 03:39:55.854]  It's happening here in America.
[03:39:57.454 --> 03:40:02.035]  We've been experiencing the importation operation of the replacement migration agenda.
[03:40:04.096 --> 03:40:05.696]  The activation is coming next.
[03:40:06.756 --> 03:40:09.137]  What that looks like, you can take a look at Europe.
[03:40:10.057 --> 03:40:13.498]  But how that will kick off for the United States of America is yet to be seen.
[03:40:13.838 --> 03:40:14.118]  Arm up!
[03:40:15.109 --> 03:40:15.609]  Two-way up.
[03:40:16.369 --> 03:40:17.110]  Buy a lot of guns.
[03:40:17.470 --> 03:40:18.290]  And tons of ammo.
[03:40:19.391 --> 03:40:20.511]  Prepare with everything.
[03:40:21.471 --> 03:40:24.412]  Prepare with everything and for everything.
[03:40:24.592 --> 03:40:26.333]  And be ready for when that day comes.
[03:40:26.393 --> 03:40:29.234]  Just because we're two-way up doesn't mean that they won't try it.
[03:40:30.254 --> 03:40:30.835]  So be ready.
[03:40:31.595 --> 03:40:31.915]  Be ready.
[03:40:31.935 --> 03:40:32.955]  I'm not calling for violence.
[03:40:33.015 --> 03:40:35.816]  I'm just saying, defend yourself at all costs.
[03:40:36.337 --> 03:40:36.677]  Alright?
[03:40:37.077 --> 03:40:38.177]  We're always gonna call for peace.
[03:40:38.897 --> 03:40:40.118]  We will always call for peace.
[03:40:40.498 --> 03:40:43.139]  They want us to go violently on the offense.
[03:40:43.772 --> 03:40:47.675]  All righty guys, that's all the time for me today on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:48.235 --> 03:40:50.777]  The War Room is coming up next right after the break.
[03:40:50.797 --> 03:40:54.059]  You can follow me on X right now at Drew H Live.
[03:40:54.259 --> 03:40:55.420]  I'll see you guys on the next one.
[03:40:59.022 --> 03:41:01.543]  And brain, blood, immune cancer, reproductive study.
[03:41:01.863 --> 03:41:02.783]  I mean, there's so many studies.
[03:41:02.803 --> 03:41:03.344]  What do you make of that?
[03:41:03.404 --> 03:41:05.484]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[03:41:05.785 --> 03:41:11.587]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[03:41:11.967 --> 03:41:13.447]  It's a government false narrative.
[03:41:13.508 --> 03:41:19.370]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[03:41:19.570 --> 03:41:20.250]  It doesn't.
[03:41:20.450 --> 03:41:22.471]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[03:41:22.491 --> 03:41:23.831]  When you follow the article, there's no link.
[03:41:23.871 --> 03:41:24.392]  There's no proof.
[03:41:24.432 --> 03:41:24.872]  It just says,
[03:41:25.572 --> 03:41:30.055]  COVID's a greater risk of heart problems than the shot and they just lie.
[03:41:30.435 --> 03:41:38.260]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC, the NIH.
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:40.881]  This is a false narrative.
[03:41:41.242 --> 03:41:44.724]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[03:41:44.764 --> 03:41:45.884]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[03:41:46.145 --> 03:41:49.947]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist Alex, I am knee-deep
[03:41:50.427 --> 03:42:00.476]  In people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure, the vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and some is inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[03:42:00.957 --> 03:42:02.859]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart.
[03:42:02.919 --> 03:42:03.479]  Another study.
[03:42:03.859 --> 03:42:09.424]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[03:42:09.485 --> 03:42:12.968]  It's very important for people to realize they may not feel chest pain initially,
[03:42:13.388 --> 03:42:19.970]  But then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[03:42:20.010 --> 03:42:22.931]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[03:42:23.251 --> 03:42:25.532]  It's vaccine myocarditis and heart failure.
[03:42:25.912 --> 03:42:27.132]  They need treatment for this.
[03:42:27.472 --> 03:42:35.235]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements, available through onlinehealthnow.com.
[03:42:36.756 --> 03:42:45.920]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:55.145]  Now I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, as bad as taking the shots,
[03:42:56.107 --> 03:43:12.806]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published, you have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[03:43:13.206 --> 03:43:16.350]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:20.872]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[03:43:21.032 --> 03:43:28.955]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[03:43:29.295 --> 03:43:30.716]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[03:43:31.016 --> 03:43:34.538]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[03:43:34.558 --> 03:43:38.579]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this.
[03:43:38.739 --> 03:43:40.280]  Very good support for doing this.
[03:43:40.720 --> 03:43:41.881]  It's natokinase.
[03:43:42.361 --> 03:43:45.523]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[03:43:45.563 --> 03:43:46.663]  Japanese discovered it.
[03:43:47.243 --> 03:43:50.845]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[03:43:51.285 --> 03:43:54.847]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[03:43:54.887 --> 03:43:56.588]  These are all in capsule format.
[03:43:56.928 --> 03:43:59.369]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[03:43:59.689 --> 03:44:01.570]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:04.612]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[03:44:04.952 --> 03:44:05.672]  So you build up?
[03:44:06.012 --> 03:44:06.733]  And we build up.
[03:44:06.773 --> 03:44:10.694]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[03:44:10.734 --> 03:44:12.875]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[03:44:13.135 --> 03:44:18.597]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners, and we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[03:44:18.858 --> 03:44:22.579]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[03:44:22.779 --> 03:44:23.779]  They don't dissolve them.
[03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:30.002]  We actually have to give thrombolytic enzymes, that's McCullough protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[03:44:30.362 --> 03:44:34.246]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[03:44:34.566 --> 03:44:35.627]  That's the go-to place.
[03:44:35.647 --> 03:44:40.972]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[03:44:41.012 --> 03:44:44.595]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase but five minor ingredients.
[03:44:44.795 --> 03:44:52.082]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
[03:44:52.462 --> 03:44:53.984]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
