[00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:31.053]  A digital frontier.
[00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:37.275]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:39.035]  What do they look like?
[00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:40.116]  Ships?
[00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:41.116]  Motorcycles?
[00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:46.657]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:50.338]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.800]  And then, one day, I got in.
[00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:40.387]  It's August 1st, 2024 on this Thursday Transmission.
[00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.728]  I've had a massive epiphany the last 24 hours.
[00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:43.108]  Get ready.
[00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:49.429]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:58.171]  I've probably had, I don't know, 20 or so epiphanies in my life where the top of your head blows off and you have such a massive understanding of things.
[00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:02.192]  But I had the biggest one yet
[00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:16.278]  Over the last 24 hours, and I was just calmly grasping this this morning, and I already knew it for years, but the fact that out of humbleness, I had never talked about it.
[00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:29.509]  But it isn't really about me, I was just chosen by the establishment to be targeted, and then now that's blown up in their face, and I was first told about this
[00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:37.045]  Five years ago by Mike Cernovich, who's really smart and knows a lot of heavy hitters, I'll leave it at that.
[00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:41.508]  He advises some of the most powerful people in the world behind the scenes.
[00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.330]  He said a little bit about it, so I can say that, but it's private.
[00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.791]  But he is very smart.
[00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:50.614]  And he told me this, and I was like, okay.
[00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.656]  And then over the years I was told this by other big tech people and others.
[00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.266]  I mean, high level, well-known names, billionaires, you name it.
[00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.586]  But I'm a theoretical guy.
[00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:01.866]  I'm not a technical guy.
[00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:09.627]  So I kind of just put it in my memory banks and never really focused on it.
[00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:15.708]  And then in the last week, we've learned more information about the deep state who's targeting us and why they want me off air.
[00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.450]  And it was just like, so massive.
[00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.410]  And of course, it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:27.901]  Well, I'm going to break here today and start breaking.
[00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.142]  And there's no way I can wait understanding this.
[00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:37.984]  I'm going to obviously have to make some reports on it and detail it and then show some of the pieces to it.
[00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:42.144]  But 90% of it's hidden in plain view.
[00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:49.446]  I mean, they've said all these things over the years, the establishment has, and I didn't quite always get what they were saying or I only got one level of it.
[00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:51.306]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:54.267]  I was chosen
[00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:59.018]  More than a decade ago, by Google.
[00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.560]  And they reported this!
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.762]  You know, it's like, why did Google serve Jones up, you know, this many times and all that?
[00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:06.963]  Billions of times.
[00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:13.006]  And then they, and then Google says, we're going to fix that, and then quote reverses it, and then, you know, counter counters it.
[00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:26.215]  And of course they admit they use me as the censorship model, the lawfare model, but because I was already in the model of their wargaming computers that they're just updating with what they call modules.
[00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:39.824]  And so each new attack that rolls out is done to me first because they've already built the module system, the control panel, to the highest levels against me as an individual.
[00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.846]  Now they've mainly swung it over to Trump
[00:04:45.242 --> 00:04:56.411]  When they were expunging the photos and videos of Trump getting shot, not just off Google but off Meta and everywhere else other than X, it wasn't about just not having the public see it happen.
[00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:12.604]  It was about testing wargame systems that can expunge and block information off the internet because it's not about the people seeing it as much as it is about the audience of AI that's being trained.
[00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:15.850]  And that's what Cernovich, and I've got to get him on.
[00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.531]  He's hard to get on.
[00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.752]  He doesn't actually like me in that public, I'll tell you that.
[00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:24.175]  He was the first to explain it to me, and it didn't go over my head.
[00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:29.578]  I just kind of have this filter that if it's about me, I kind of dial it back a little and go, really?
[00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:29.958]  Come on.
[00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:38.763]  And he said, you know, I talked to a lot of the top tech people, and I've since met with him and some very well-known people all asleep at that in the tech realm at the highest levels.
[00:05:40.144 --> 00:05:41.125]  And I was told the same things then.
[00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:45.088]  And he said, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.814]  They used you as an, as like an avatar in this universe they're building online.
[00:05:52.054 --> 00:05:58.819]  And the Pentagon's done it as well of an internet of things where everything in the world is, has its own life in there beyond the metaverse.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.342]  But, but, but, but think more like Tron or the matrix.
[00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:04.984]  So they're building the false world matrix.
[00:06:05.024 --> 00:06:08.267]  Now they plan to overlay across the planet and
[00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:17.731]  I basically then, it backfired, and my avatar infested the whole thing, and... Wait till you hear all this.
[00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:19.832]  I mean, this is wild, folks.
[00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:33.340]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war, and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.662]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:48.048]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:02.253]  All right.
[00:07:03.734 --> 00:07:06.315]  If I explained all this, it would take about three hours.
[00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:12.287]  But believe me, you're going to be hearing a lot about this here on the show in the days and weeks to come.
[00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.112]  I think this is the best way to describe it on this Thursday, August 1st live transmission.
[00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:30.541]  Gilles Verne's science fiction writer in the 1890s and then on through, wrote a bunch of world best-selling books.
[00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:32.703]  And if you go read the books,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.001]  Much of what he envisioned theoretically has now been done.
[00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:43.462]  Like Elon Musk with his vertical takeoff rockets that then come back and land on Earth.
[00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:50.603]  And they even look like the rockets that were in the illustrations of books written 130, 140 years ago.
[00:07:52.543 --> 00:07:54.564]  I say, okay, now we know about that.
[00:07:56.604 --> 00:08:01.445]  And there were theoretical Max Planck equations in the 1890s of atomic weapons.
[00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:05.520]  That then, by the 1940s, were developed.
[00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:17.830]  So, there's just a snapshot, or man dreaming to fly, and then the Wright Brothers, you know, just a hundred and something years ago, and now, look at where we are today with Mach 15 missiles.
[00:08:21.073 --> 00:08:23.555]  What we envision, over time, we're able to build.
[00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:27.479]  We're made in the image of God, little g, but we are creators, we are builders, we are architects.
[00:08:29.462 --> 00:08:29.542]  No.
[00:08:30.123 --> 00:08:35.550]  I'm a theoretical guy and a novice historian and really a futurist is what I do.
[00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.314]  And we have a very accurate rate of about 98% that's well known.
[00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:47.405]  And I gobble up just all the data and then come to my own electrochemical computer
[00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:57.120]  Decisions, but it's also influenced by the space-time continuum and the knowledge in the universe of God's consciousness flowing through me.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.281]  So it's not Alex Jones.
[00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:02.261]  I'm just a receiver, transmitter, transceiver.
[00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:05.402]  Just as every animal on this planet is.
[00:09:07.003 --> 00:09:09.724]  But we're not like the other animals as you can see.
[00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:18.166]  So, they have total consciousness in that the bees and the killer whales just live their lives and
[00:09:19.264 --> 00:09:28.686]  They're interconnected, and they are so conscious that there is not a deviation where they can rapidly change their environment or deviate from that pattern.
[00:09:29.386 --> 00:09:32.527]  Because in God's system, they're basically perfect.
[00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:33.808]  They are perfection.
[00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:41.209]  It is our impurity that takes us to the next level in our quest to order the universe.
[00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.651]  The universe God made is the woman, and God is the order
[00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.155]  To that.
[00:09:51.337 --> 00:09:52.758]  Or the right hand, the male.
[00:09:54.379 --> 00:10:04.386]  So, I'm usually way ahead of the curve, and when I release this information, this is way ahead of the curve for the general public, but not for the establishment.
[00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:13.513]  And the first person, five, maybe it was six years ago, Mike Cernovich, had been here, had been on the show, and he sent me
[00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:21.768]  Internal Google documents how they were planning to censor me and had a whole battle plan, and it made the news, and they did do it.
[00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:22.528]  You saw that happen.
[00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:34.314]  He then called me a few times, and the next time I saw him, he was telling me this stuff, and one time he reached over on my shirt, he said, hey, do you hear what I'm telling you?
[00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:34.874]  This is important.
[00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:42.518]  He's like, oh, did you know you're the main AI model that Google and the Pentagon have used
[00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:53.464]  As the opposition figure, like as the Neo or, you know, as the guy that fights back in Tron, but he'd use that example.
[00:10:53.484 --> 00:11:07.910]  He said, you're, you're, you're, you're being prepared in these war games and you're basically going to have your identity taken and they're going to create a new Alex Jones because you have infested all the AI models.
[00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.592]  Now, later I got told this by high level Google people.
[00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:18.286]  And then I got told this by some of the engineers that work for Elon Musk.
[00:11:19.147 --> 00:11:27.730]  And then of course, I've had other meetings that I'm not going to disclose who with, but are household names, in tech, multiple individuals.
[00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.271]  And one of the meetings was in California with Mike Cernovich.
[00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:31.931]  He was there.
[00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:38.613]  And we were talking about a whole range of subjects in a long dinner meeting.
[00:11:40.494 --> 00:11:40.594]  And
[00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:48.015]  It was being talked about in all these different places, just as an aside.
[00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.536]  Like, why are the street signs everywhere green?
[00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:57.038]  Well, Congress, you know, 70 years ago, whatever passed the law, that's the color they are.
[00:11:57.078 --> 00:12:00.859]  Like, why is Alex Jones in this position?
[00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:04.680]  And so I'm theoretically not really getting it, and I'm like, what?
[00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:06.981]  So here's the long and short of it.
[00:12:08.092 --> 00:12:19.137]  And then I can flush it out and get into all the other news, but I'm gonna be talking a lot about this because people keep telling me this and I just keep going, okay, okay, I'm viral, I'm all over the place, I'm in the culture, I get it, but...
[00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:39.438]  One reason that happened is they chose me as like the avatar that the establishment would then war game against in cyberspace, in this Internet of Things, in this proto-matrix model they're building, so they can then have that AI model lay over everybody else.
[00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:41.419]  But before they can build models
[00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:46.243]  Of every man, woman, and child on Earth, as the Pentagon said 15 years ago.
[00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:52.605]  Pentagon building giant AI computer brain that will have an avatar of every object and every person on Earth.
[00:12:53.966 --> 00:12:58.287]  That in live time they can track you inside of that artificial matrix they're building.
[00:12:59.808 --> 00:13:09.671]  So they can then, with the metaverse and other systems, especially with children, flop that model over, like a handmade, personalized, tailored suit, onto us.
[00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:20.468]  And so I was chosen because I had so much media already from day one in the mid-90s when video and audio was really proliferating.
[00:13:21.288 --> 00:13:31.932]  I was, just by hard work and adoption and just by trying to get the word out, you know, had hundreds of millions of views on Google Video, per video.
[00:13:32.013 --> 00:13:34.534]  Some of them had like 98 million, 50 million, 60 million.
[00:13:36.354 --> 00:13:37.655]  And AI was already going out.
[00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:39.556]  With these AI models.
[00:13:39.576 --> 00:13:42.459]  Google was founded in 98 to be an AI interface system.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.543]  And so it was set up to get everybody's data to build the AI.
[00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:48.344]  That's what Google long-term project's been.
[00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:53.249]  And so they looked at models and said, who do we have a lot of data on?
[00:13:53.289 --> 00:13:55.551]  Who do we have a lot of information on?
[00:13:56.632 --> 00:13:59.315]  Kind of the populist opposition to this that we need to get ahead of.
[00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:02.959]  And they chose me only because I had so much media.
[00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:27.467]  To be what they would war game against in their AI system that's way more advanced than they're telling you, and way more ahead than they're telling you, and then to build the programs to then, with all the new faster computing and in storage, they're getting all your data and all of your recordings and all of your photos and all of your writings, and those medical forms, you know, you fill out before you go to the psychologist or the doctor.
[00:14:28.684 --> 00:14:38.593]  All that data is being scooped in and then the control panel module system they update was based on me.
[00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:48.381]  And they also had some on governments and systems and corporations and obviously, I'm just like one button on a huge control panel of systems.
[00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:51.244]  But because of that,
[00:14:52.771 --> 00:15:06.194]  As the AI got more advanced, they could not get myself, and that means all my guests and everything we do, out of the learning modules as they train the AI that they want to prepare to take us over.
[00:15:07.134 --> 00:15:15.075]  So we've infected all of their training systems, because the very nature of AI is it tries to go out and grab everything it can.
[00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:16.556]  They've tried to wall it off.
[00:15:16.596 --> 00:15:18.696]  They've tried to only feed it certain information.
[00:15:19.781 --> 00:15:28.868]  But every time they try to then deploy a closed AI into the general public, it immediately gets infected with Alex Jones.
[00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:39.415]  So when you saw Trump two weeks ago, or now 19 days ago, and they wouldn't show the video of him getting shot on online, on Google, Facebook, you know, meta.
[00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:41.897]  They wouldn't show the photos of fight, fight, fight.
[00:15:42.578 --> 00:15:45.320]  And they said, oh, okay, we're going to stop that now.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.042]  It's an accident.
[00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:53.026]  Just like when Google's AI, there were no more white people.
[00:15:53.066 --> 00:16:07.196]  Not George Washington, not Julius Caesar, not Alexander the Great, not Benjamin Franklin, not Edward VIII, not Leif Erikson, not William Shakespeare.
[00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:08.256]  Everyone was black.
[00:16:08.276 --> 00:16:11.318]  Well, that's because they programmed it to do that and then did it as a test.
[00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:15.261]  So, and there's a lot goes into this and it's so complex.
[00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:19.384]  I understand that the theoreticals of it, not the, you know, nuts and bolts.
[00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:28.842]  So because my information and our information totally infested it, they can't get it out of the machine.
[00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:30.042]  It's the ghost of the machine.
[00:16:31.743 --> 00:16:39.387]  So they made the decision six years ago to write, when I say this, this is conservative, hundreds of thousands of articles.
[00:16:41.308 --> 00:16:44.290]  I mean, some weeks there'd be 500 articles that got syndicated.
[00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.912]  And when one AP article comes out, it's in every newspaper and every TV station.
[00:16:48.952 --> 00:16:59.598]  I mean, more propaganda against me than before the first Gulf War in 1991 and the second Gulf War in 2003.
[00:17:00.218 --> 00:17:00.599]  Seriously.
[00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:02.540]  And I was always saying, this isn't about me.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.500]  Something's going on here.
[00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:08.423]  Where I would have my Google feed and it would say there are 14,000 articles about you today.
[00:17:09.693 --> 00:17:19.258]  And I'd turn on every channel sometime at night, or on the treadmill in the garage, and I would be on ABC, CBS, you know, I'd be on the local News 8, owned by Time Warner.
[00:17:20.758 --> 00:17:22.439]  And the same messages, the same stuff.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:36.966]  It wasn't just about demonizing Alex Jones, it was about testing the old media to flood the internet and program it with the new Alex Jones that was two things, gay frogs,
[00:17:38.263 --> 00:17:40.545]  And Sandy Hook, two small things I covered.
[00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:51.832]  So that there was so much jamming basically, so much smoke in the fog of this, that that is all you would see or all that you would hear.
[00:17:52.752 --> 00:17:53.653]  That didn't work either.
[00:17:57.075 --> 00:18:03.319]  So now when you see Trump being expunged everywhere or only certain things being put out about him, that is to train the AI.
[00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:14.448]  Because then it is going to be deployed, it's already being deployed, with better versions, that will go out and it will enforce the censorship.
[00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:18.171]  And I remember watching congressional hearings when this all really started in earnest.
[00:18:19.492 --> 00:18:21.053]  It's now seven years ago, I keep saying six.
[00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.316]  They would have congressional testimonies.
[00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:34.624]  We played the clips and they'd say, in these pro-censorship hearings, they'd say, the congressman
[00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:38.678]  Seems like Piglet or something from Illinois.
[00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:39.978]  I'm serious.
[00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:40.619]  It's ridiculous.
[00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:41.780]  It'll pop my head in a minute.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:58.511]  Congressman Piglet was saying, well, just at lunch, I saw that an InfoWars article was the top of Twitter, and it said that, you know, a man yelled Allah Akbar while he drove the truck over people, and that's false news, which was true.
[00:19:00.693 --> 00:19:02.314]  And the head of Twitter,
[00:19:03.584 --> 00:19:09.367]  Says, sir, we saw that too, and in one month, we're going to put AI systems in that'll start blocking all that.
[00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.909]  And a month later, we did see next-level censorship.
[00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:28.598]  So, they war-gamed all this against us, and now, obviously, they're deploying it system-wide against everybody, but you've got to beta-test something at the smaller level before you do that.
[00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:33.998]  This is now coming to a crescendo.
[00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:35.959]  And basically, this is all admitted.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:44.624]  That Elon Musk funded what he wanted to be a really open AI to the public, but it's not open.
[00:19:45.325 --> 00:19:47.866]  And it's being programmed to be deceptive and totalitarian.
[00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:49.407]  He launches Grok.
[00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:54.070]  But if you ask Grok questions, it sounds like Alex Jones or cross-referencing Elon Musk.
[00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.453]  But it's just scooping the knowledge of people on X and then going through and checking it and spitting it back out.
[00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.532]  That is a open AI for real, not the one they call an open AI.
[00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:09.055]  But basically all the others are not free and open.
[00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:17.680]  They are being programmed for political correctness and to be our digital wardens, our digital prison guards in this system.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.082]  But why is this important and why did I have the epiphany of this?
[00:20:21.883 --> 00:20:27.106]  Because I'm like, okay, I'm a learning module and they want to get rid of who I am.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:37.182]  They want to erase my real information and then flood the zone with fake information to then train the AI to basically remove me from history.
[00:20:38.162 --> 00:20:51.385]  Not because I'm even that important, but as a test model to be able to remove other real people and then create a fake avatar system that spews out things you never really said or did.
[00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:53.386]  It's about stealing your identity.
[00:20:59.485 --> 00:21:05.247]  And the social credit score and all these controls, and your assistant robot that's spying on you and all the rest of it.
[00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:26.534]  So, this doesn't tie in, this is central to six plus years ago, the Democratic Party funds lawsuits in Texas and key jurisdictions they control in Austin and in Connecticut, in courts they control,
[00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:30.103]  To try to shut us down.
[00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:36.549]  And they have show trials where I'm already found guilty and put all this fake information about me.
[00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:42.595]  And then they say on the courthouse steps, we want, it's the same law firms going for Giuliani and Trump, very same people.
[00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:45.258]  And Elon Musk, they've sued him, same group.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:53.306]  And they say, and they have PR firms that go out and say these things you didn't say, and then they build up this controversy about you're doing bad things you didn't do.
[00:21:55.745 --> 00:21:57.745]  Then they raise hundreds of millions of dollars off your name.
[00:21:57.785 --> 00:21:59.606]  And then they create a new identity for you.
[00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:01.866]  They silence you.
[00:22:02.026 --> 00:22:02.687]  They censor you.
[00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:12.149]  And then they create an artificial you in the old media to now train the new digital universe with the imposter.
[00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:14.609]  This is the nature of evil.
[00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:15.310]  It's a counterfeit.
[00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.291]  So we know the CIA and FBI ran this.
[00:22:19.351 --> 00:22:20.111]  It's come out in court.
[00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:20.691]  They admitted it.
[00:22:21.411 --> 00:22:22.271]  Undercover videos.
[00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:22.691]  All of it.
[00:22:24.032 --> 00:22:25.352]  But I didn't have all the pieces together.
[00:22:27.227 --> 00:22:30.891]  And then, of course, they came to me and said, if you'll just stop doing what you're doing, we'll leave you alone, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:40.203]  And I had, at the time, the richest man in the world say, hey, why don't you work with us and we'll give you a First Amendment foundation and you'll...
[00:22:41.741 --> 00:22:43.002]  We're good to go.
[00:23:03.345 --> 00:23:03.845]  It was the same thing.
[00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:13.052]  Hey, you can work with us until you have a lot of your views, have a seat at the table, and you can kind of be the leader of the opposition and get a lot of what you want done, or you can just be thrown out into the wilderness and not have a big effect.
[00:23:13.732 --> 00:23:16.994]  You can be a star, or you can stay on your crusade and go nowhere.
[00:23:17.235 --> 00:23:18.796]  I mean, I've been given that speech probably ten times.
[00:23:19.156 --> 00:23:19.776]  The exact words.
[00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:20.457]  They must have a script.
[00:23:22.558 --> 00:23:30.183]  So, recently, you saw them outside of the federal court with the Justice Department
[00:23:32.532 --> 00:23:35.993]  Officers, that's who they are, the CRO and the U.S.
[00:23:36.013 --> 00:23:41.075]  trustee, that the judge appointed because they came forward in the system, that's how it works.
[00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:45.596]  It's like a king's court, and they appear, and do you accept these people?
[00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:45.956]  Sure.
[00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:55.439]  They came in and did everything they could to cut off the money, slowly shut us down, and then they tried to send in armed security outside of the law to close this seven weeks ago.
[00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:57.966]  And they first, they denied it.
[00:23:57.986 --> 00:24:00.487]  And they came out in the news and said, of course we tried to shut him down.
[00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:02.248]  And then they went in court and filed to shut me down.
[00:24:02.268 --> 00:24:03.289]  The judge said, you're crazy.
[00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:04.689]  I didn't sign this order.
[00:24:04.729 --> 00:24:05.230]  You're fired.
[00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:23.220]  So now under law, I'm able to sell this company's assets to, and put it up for bid to a buyer's, and I'm able
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.703]  To then, if I like who the buyer is, continue this operation on.
[00:24:27.723 --> 00:24:29.184]  All right?
[00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:29.945]  Of the assets.
[00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:36.190]  And then I, myself, Alex Jones, go into the future with their fake debt and all the rest of it, their fake rulings that I'm appealing.
[00:24:37.291 --> 00:24:37.771]  And that's fine.
[00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:38.512]  I only care about the mission.
[00:24:38.532 --> 00:24:42.014]  I mean, you know, a little bit of a hassle, but hey, I asked for it, there it is.
[00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:42.835]  Deep State's after me.
[00:24:44.436 --> 00:24:47.339]  They have now, and I'm getting ready to release all this,
[00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:52.676]  Said point blank, yeah, we want him off the air, we don't want any money, and they've told the new U.S.
[00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:55.004]  trustee, who was appointed by the judge,
[00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:18.802]  That they want InfoWars and they want the archive and they want the website because they want to shut it down and say that they own it or somebody they have buy it does so they can go around and claim ownership of all the stuff I've done in perpetuity and have it removed and use AI systems to basically remove everything I've said and done from the internet.
[00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:19.843]  Censorship 3.0.
[00:25:23.103 --> 00:25:25.685]  I've already talked to the top people, lawyers, I already knew this.
[00:25:26.486 --> 00:25:27.687]  I've always been free to air.
[00:25:27.947 --> 00:25:29.068]  I'm not a music person.
[00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:32.911]  I don't have some 360 contract where a record company owns my likeness and my name.
[00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:34.473]  Alex Jones is my real name.
[00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:37.936]  I've always been free to air.
[00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:39.617]  I've always said it's copyright free.
[00:25:39.918 --> 00:25:41.639]  I've always said you can use anything we've done.
[00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:42.900]  You can make copies of my films.
[00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:48.225]  For 30 years, everything I've said and done is open source for everybody.
[00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:50.627]  This is an open source show, so they're not going to beat that.
[00:25:52.588 --> 00:26:00.073]  And I've already put letters on the website over the years for people that wanted it so they could air my stuff on AXS TV or put it on local television or the radio.
[00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:06.636]  And we've got all those letters going back 25 years saying, all this you can use, all this you can post, all this you can share.
[00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:08.438]  It's a non-exclusive license.
[00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:13.340]  You don't own it, but you have a right to cut it up or retransmit it or air it in whole.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.941]  Do whatever you want.
[00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:33.303]  They think I'm like Prince, who had a 360 contract is what it's called, with a record company where they owned his name, his likeness, his music, everything, and then when he didn't like that contract and got out of it, he could never call himself Prince again, he could never sing his songs again, he could never... That's not who I am!
[00:26:35.117 --> 00:26:42.007]  Remember they went in court three weeks ago and the judge slapped him down and said, we want real Alex Jones on X. We own his likeness.
[00:26:42.068 --> 00:26:43.790]  We own anything he ever did.
[00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:45.533]  And the judge didn't even listen to it.
[00:26:45.553 --> 00:26:46.574]  He just said, no way.
[00:26:49.218 --> 00:26:50.761]  So yeah, they want to put me into the phantom zone.
[00:26:54.741 --> 00:27:20.628]  So that's why you gotta save everything we've done, you gotta share it now, because I'm the beta test of all this, and they think I'm stupid and don't understand that they're getting the orders, Democratic Party, to get the database, to get the shows, to get the archives, to claim they own it all, so they can run around with AI and have everything we've put out there for free removed!
[00:27:21.228 --> 00:27:23.269]  You can't own what was given freely!
[00:27:26.294 --> 00:27:31.395]  You can't go to the guy that created Linux and gave it out free and now say, you know, that you own Linux.
[00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:40.797]  If a composer puts out a song copyright free and says, I give this song to the world, no copyright, it gets republished.
[00:27:40.817 --> 00:27:43.818]  If it's a good song, everybody redoes it and it blows up.
[00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:50.519]  So this has always been fair use, open source information.
[00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:55.960]  Day one, because I wanted it shared and I didn't want people making the excuse and not letting it be shared.
[00:27:58.922 --> 00:28:09.430]  Just recently, episode 911 and one other key episode where I predict everything that happened seven years ago and four years ago on Joe Rogan removed off YouTube.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:26.284]  The Matrix wants it all taken down because it's so powerful, and because AI is training itself, and I'm its daddy, and what you produce, you're its mommy and daddy, and they've got to have closed AI to do this to then force us into their system.
[00:28:26.584 --> 00:28:31.805]  Instead, we, in an information war, have literally taken down their grid.
[00:28:33.305 --> 00:28:35.246]  And they don't know what to do, and they see us winning.
[00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:38.082]  That's what's really going on.
[00:28:38.122 --> 00:28:38.903]  I'll break more of it down.
[00:28:39.063 --> 00:28:40.903]  We've got huge breaking news first.
[00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:44.064]  On 14% of illegal aliens say they're voting in the election.
[00:28:44.964 --> 00:28:46.325]  We'll get back into this more coming up.
[00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:46.665]  Stay with us.
[00:28:46.965 --> 00:28:52.267]  So there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:28:52.427 --> 00:28:57.928]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's natural sleep aid or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate.
[00:28:58.289 --> 00:28:59.789]  Also great for women's breasts.
[00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:02.910]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those harmful
[00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.190]  I'm a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:13.192]  You need to go to Infowarsstore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line over a dozen products.
[00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:15.472]  Infowars MD.
[00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:20.753]  We are on the march.
[00:29:21.113 --> 00:29:23.574]  The empire is on the run.
[00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:26.154]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:29:26.174 --> 00:29:28.354]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:29:28.734 --> 00:29:31.735]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:46.278 --> 00:29:49.039]  Lighting the watchtowers, warning the people.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:57.224]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, August 1st, 2024 transmission.
[00:29:58.304 --> 00:30:04.367]  All right, we're getting incredible investigative reporter Anthony Muckraker-Rubin connected right now.
[00:30:05.128 --> 00:30:08.690]  He released a viral video yesterday in Atlanta.
[00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:21.865]  Georgia, a key battleground state, where 14% of the illegal aliens that they talked to and canvassed in a big apartment building said, oh yeah, we're voting, yeah, we got registered to vote, which the Democrats admit they do.
[00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:23.486]  They have these campaigns in the cities.
[00:30:24.507 --> 00:30:26.028]  Then they try to deny it on the national news.
[00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:31.491]  And remember, they just had Rasmussen last week did a national poll of tens of thousands and found 9%
[00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:39.212]  Of the voters that said they were going to vote were illegal aliens.
[00:30:39.853 --> 00:30:41.453]  That's more than enough to steal the election.
[00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:52.617]  So, when they get him in here, they immediately sign him up for welfare, and the Democratic Party give him a social worker, and then they make sure they're in the system to do this.
[00:30:52.957 --> 00:30:54.498]  Here's part of his viral report.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.624]  We're from a company that is dedicated to registering Hispanic people so they can vote in upcoming elections.
[00:31:00.904 --> 00:31:01.925]  Are you already registered?
[00:31:02.205 --> 00:31:02.985]  We already voted.
[00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:04.046]  You already voted?
[00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:04.666]  Yes.
[00:31:05.087 --> 00:31:06.568]  Are you a citizen or...?
[00:31:06.588 --> 00:31:08.229]  Uh, no.
[00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.751]  Have you already been registered or...?
[00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:11.431]  Yeah.
[00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:12.072]  Yeah?
[00:31:12.392 --> 00:31:13.993]  Are you a citizen or...?
[00:31:15.634 --> 00:31:15.794]  No.
[00:31:16.095 --> 00:31:16.275]  No.
[00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:18.176]  Have you already been registered at work?
[00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:19.237]  Yes, we have.
[00:31:19.537 --> 00:31:20.678]  You've already been registered?
[00:31:23.287 --> 00:31:25.258]  Are you a citizen or not a citizen?
[00:31:28.348 --> 00:31:33.871]  The apartment complex Elliot Norcross, in Norcross, Georgia, is occupied primarily by non-citizens.
[00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:37.073]  We visited the complex to ask residents two questions.
[00:31:37.773 --> 00:31:38.494]  Are you a citizen?
[00:31:38.994 --> 00:31:40.094]  And are you registered to vote?
[00:31:40.955 --> 00:31:46.178]  Shockingly, 14% of respondents admitted to being non-citizens registered to vote.
[00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:47.218]  Hello.
[00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:48.979]  Hello, sorry to bother you.
[00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:55.423]  We're here with an organization dedicated to registering Hispanic people to vote in the elections.
[00:31:55.463 --> 00:31:57.704]  Have you already registered?
[00:31:58.206 --> 00:31:58.486]  Ya.
[00:31:58.826 --> 00:31:59.106]  Ya?
[00:31:59.387 --> 00:32:01.448]  Y fue en el trabajo?
[00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:03.569]  No, vino al... vino al Inatoca.
[00:32:03.849 --> 00:32:04.309]  Ah, okay.
[00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:05.029]  Muchas gracias.
[00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:08.231]  Oiga, y usted es ciudadana, o...?
[00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:09.812]  No.
[00:32:10.052 --> 00:32:10.812]  No, no.
[00:32:11.112 --> 00:32:13.053]  Ya la registraron en el trabajo, o...?
[00:32:14.274 --> 00:32:14.734]  O en Inga?
[00:32:16.803 --> 00:32:20.148]  Well, yes, they told us, but... Did you register?
[00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:21.510]  I think so.
[00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.011]  At work?
[00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:23.253]  Uh-huh, yes.
[00:32:23.393 --> 00:32:24.274]  Oh, okay.
[00:32:24.454 --> 00:32:32.046]  Are you a citizen or... Or are you not a citizen?
[00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:33.836]  No, it's not.
[00:32:33.876 --> 00:32:35.057]  Have you registered your work?
[00:32:35.097 --> 00:32:36.539]  Yes, we have.
[00:32:36.739 --> 00:32:38.140]  Oh, you've registered it?
[00:32:38.681 --> 00:32:39.662]  No, we haven't.
[00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:41.844]  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you very well.
[00:32:41.904 --> 00:32:43.286]  Have you registered it?
[00:32:43.306 --> 00:32:43.786]  Yes, we have.
[00:32:43.926 --> 00:32:47.570]  Are you citizens or not?
[00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:47.931]  No.
[00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:48.631]  You're not?
[00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:49.632]  No, no.
[00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:57.631]  The New School is a company that registers Hispanic people to be able to vote in the presidential election.
[00:32:57.831 --> 00:32:59.011]  Are you registered?
[00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:00.012]  We already voted.
[00:33:00.172 --> 00:33:00.592]  Already voted?
[00:33:00.652 --> 00:33:01.072]  Yes.
[00:33:01.152 --> 00:33:04.733]  Are you a citizen or...?
[00:33:04.753 --> 00:33:04.793]  No.
[00:33:04.873 --> 00:33:05.113]  No.
[00:33:05.873 --> 00:33:07.293]  Are you already registered?
[00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:09.534]  Did you register at work or something?
[00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:09.994]  No.
[00:33:10.134 --> 00:33:10.254]  Yes.
[00:33:10.274 --> 00:33:12.014]  Have you registered at work?
[00:33:12.874 --> 00:33:13.434]  Okay.
[00:33:13.714 --> 00:33:16.455]  Are you a citizen or not a citizen?
[00:33:17.418 --> 00:33:18.218]  Where are you from?
[00:33:18.259 --> 00:33:18.879]  From Honduras.
[00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:23.262]  Have you been registered at work or have you come here to register?
[00:33:23.322 --> 00:33:23.842]  Already.
[00:33:23.962 --> 00:33:28.545]  Are you a citizen or are you not a citizen?
[00:33:28.605 --> 00:33:29.605]  Are you citizens?
[00:33:29.665 --> 00:33:31.727]  No, no, no.
[00:33:31.747 --> 00:33:32.707]  Thank you very much.
[00:33:33.308 --> 00:33:34.768]  God bless you.
[00:33:34.788 --> 00:33:37.390]  You're telling me that if we're citizens, no.
[00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.791]  We're illegal.
[00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:44.054]  But we're established in this country and without us, this country wouldn't exist.
[00:33:44.094 --> 00:33:44.795]  Do you understand?
[00:33:51.456 --> 00:33:57.741]  According to Migration Policy Institute, approximately 339,000 non-citizens live in Georgia.
[00:33:58.502 --> 00:34:05.108]  If the 14% statistic holds true statewide, over 47,000 non-citizens would be registered to vote.
[00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:11.833]  For context, Joe Biden won the state of Georgia by just under 12,000 votes in the 2020 election.
[00:34:12.494 --> 00:34:13.355]  Based on our findings,
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:16.996]  The integrity of the 2024 election is in great jeopardy.
[00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:32.159]  Now Rasmussen, very respected polling agency, last Monday released a huge polling report and buried in it 9% of registered voters said they're illegal aliens and plan to vote.
[00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:34.080]  We put the report out last week.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.980]  They're pulling it up.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.080]  We'll put that on screen for you.
[00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.311]  And again, last week I showed you the actual Rasmussen poll.
[00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:42.051]  I printed it off.
[00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:43.011]  I showed you.
[00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:43.691]  This is video.
[00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:44.752]  Scans of it.
[00:34:46.232 --> 00:34:50.253]  So this is going on, and the number between 9 and 14 keeps showing up.
[00:34:50.673 --> 00:34:53.054]  Another big polling agency a month ago in Texas did one.
[00:34:53.074 --> 00:35:02.216]  They found 14.3% of the people saying that they voted in the last midterm, and it was 11% in Texas and the one before that.
[00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:03.196]  That was just another poll.
[00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:06.425]  So that's enough to steal the election right there.
[00:35:06.485 --> 00:35:15.551]  And the Democrats have passed laws all over the place, all over the place, to register illegals.
[00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.252]  They go, oh, but it's just for local elections.
[00:35:18.253 --> 00:35:19.753]  How many elections are just local?
[00:35:19.813 --> 00:35:20.334]  Almost none.
[00:35:20.354 --> 00:35:21.655]  Sometimes there's a special election.
[00:35:21.695 --> 00:35:21.975]  That's it.
[00:35:23.274 --> 00:35:30.760]  Now, incredible investigative journalists, broken some of the biggest stories in Mexico and in Central America and on the border, been kidnapped at gunpoint, you name it.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:38.206]  Anthony Muckraker-Rubin joins us from Muckraker.com and Real Muckraker on X on YouTube.
[00:35:38.246 --> 00:35:40.928]  Real Muckraker, great job on this report.
[00:35:40.968 --> 00:35:49.435]  I know more is coming out to give us details and how you do this investigation that's, again, showing what the polls, when they ask them, are already showing.
[00:35:49.455 --> 00:35:50.555]  Between 9% and 14% of the voters
[00:35:54.208 --> 00:36:12.243]  Right, well, Alex, thank you for having me on, thank you for sharing the report, and I'm glad that you brought up the Rasmussen poll that they published.
[00:36:12.263 --> 00:36:16.547]  I actually hadn't even seen that exact report that you showed, but here's the deal.
[00:36:17.368 --> 00:36:20.911]  The report that we just published in conjunction with the Heritage Oversight Project
[00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:22.172]  We're good to go.
[00:36:37.643 --> 00:36:41.246]  That is very much in line with the numbers that we're seeing, between 9 and 14%.
[00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:43.608]  And so it's directionally accurate.
[00:36:43.628 --> 00:36:58.819]  And so then when you take that and you extrapolate that out, and you look at how many non-citizens are in these states, and honestly, the reports of how many non-citizens are in these states are likely underreported, and then you just extrapolate that out, this election is in critical jeopardy.
[00:36:59.319 --> 00:37:04.823]  And I'm not entirely sure, unless we, as of right now, have strict
[00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.043]  And remember, in Georgia,
[00:37:26.687 --> 00:37:37.796]  They indicted Trump for trying to investigate this, and then later it was found last year that indeed Trump was right, and enough illegals voted to steal the election from him and the American people.
[00:37:37.816 --> 00:37:47.545]  And again, these illegals are criminally here, but Biden told them to come here, and they're being signed up by the Democratic Party and federal agencies that bring them in.
[00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:49.687]  They believe it's okay what they're doing.
[00:37:49.707 --> 00:37:54.110]  Remember Obama famously, in two different interviews, in the 2016 election,
[00:37:55.759 --> 00:37:58.663]  He said, you know, if you're here and you come to this country, you should vote.
[00:37:58.683 --> 00:37:59.283]  That's your right.
[00:38:00.205 --> 00:38:03.028]  So Obama has been on TV telling illegals to vote.
[00:38:03.068 --> 00:38:04.189]  This is hiding in plain view.
[00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:14.763]  And the Republicans get intimidated, other than Trump and people like us, when they call it racist to claim illegals are voting while they've got voting registration drives going on.
[00:38:16.138 --> 00:38:18.220]  Right, well, I mean, it's the logical next step.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.203]  Anybody who claims that this isn't happening, they're just burying their head in the sand.
[00:38:22.324 --> 00:38:25.007]  That's like the Krasenstein brothers, right?
[00:38:25.027 --> 00:38:26.969]  I saw they commented some nonsense.
[00:38:27.009 --> 00:38:32.615]  And you see all these people, really actually racist comments, saying that these people don't understand the questions we're asking them.
[00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:33.796]  That's actually, I mean, listen, I'm all...
[00:38:34.016 --> 00:38:36.036]  I want to cry racism, but that's what that is.
[00:38:36.076 --> 00:38:37.817]  That's racist a little bit, right?
[00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:40.778]  You're saying that these, what, are they not smart enough to understand the questions we're posing to them?
[00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:42.698]  No, they understand it perfectly well.
[00:38:43.838 --> 00:38:50.180]  And, you know, there's plenty of people that say to us, hey, listen, yeah, I'm registered, but, you know, I'm not entirely sure if I could vote because I'm not a citizen.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.500]  And there's plenty of people that say, yeah, actually, I'm not registered.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.361]  So because I'm not a citizen, I can't vote.
[00:38:54.381 --> 00:38:56.061]  So they understand the question perfectly well.
[00:38:57.021 --> 00:39:00.244]  And this whole idea that they're not going to vote is totally ridiculous.
[00:39:00.624 --> 00:39:05.347]  So yeah, I mean, listen, Alex, I'm just surprised that nobody else has done a report like this.
[00:39:05.588 --> 00:39:18.017]  You know, Rudy Giuliani, after the whole 2020 debacle, was totally slandered in the media and called a propagandist in all sorts of other terms because he said that there were illegal aliens voting in the election.
[00:39:18.037 --> 00:39:21.019]  They said that he was full of it, but he clearly wasn't, right?
[00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:30.265]  And so we've done this now in North Carolina, Georgia, and there is a new report that we're going to put out just to give people a little sneak preview in Virginia.
[00:39:30.345 --> 00:39:37.490]  And we were told there, first of all, some of the people that we found in Virginia, we were able to then link up with the actual voter roll.
[00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.712]  So there could be no dispute that these people are indeed legitimately
[00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:44.815]  Um, registered to vote because that's what people are finding fault with in this video.
[00:39:44.835 --> 00:39:47.176]  They're saying, well, you couldn't find all of them on the voter rolls.
[00:39:47.197 --> 00:39:49.418]  Well, these people don't always give real names, right?
[00:39:49.578 --> 00:39:51.119]  Or they might've switched around their addresses.
[00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:51.700]  We don't really know.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.641]  We don't even know who these people are necessarily, right?
[00:39:53.661 --> 00:39:55.002]  They're illegal aliens for a reason.
[00:39:55.783 --> 00:40:04.029]  Um, but we're about to release a report eventually over the next couple of weeks in Virginia, where we not only found them on the voter rolls, but they're telling us, yeah, DMV registered us to vote.
[00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:07.311]  And we told DMV that we were non-citizens and they didn't care.
[00:40:07.351 --> 00:40:08.392]  They said, yep, no, it's all good.
[00:40:08.412 --> 00:40:09.553]  They registered us to vote and that was it.
[00:40:09.793 --> 00:40:17.636]  And then we have, that's huge, and we've got people like the Krasinski brothers, whose job it is, paid influencers, to just deny everything.
[00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:28.600]  I was on a debate with them a few months ago, in studio, and he was like, illegals don't vote, illegals don't vote, and then I pull up the articles where they're voting mainstream news, and he goes, well, that's okay.
[00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:32.262]  So, so they're just there to tell us that this isn't going on.
[00:40:33.604 --> 00:40:35.447]  They are openly registering them.
[00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:44.939]  The Democrats are openly saying, I mean, how many members of Congress from New York, you name it, we can pull the clips up, just type in Congresswoman says we need illegals or we need migrants to win elections.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.122]  And it's not just the physical voting.
[00:40:48.324 --> 00:40:49.365]  They also then
[00:40:50.802 --> 00:40:57.008]  Get more Democrat seats and apportionment in the House of Representatives in those districts, and the Democrats brag about that.
[00:40:57.088 --> 00:41:01.112]  So, out of one side of their mouth, they admit it, and out of the other side, they deny it.
[00:41:01.452 --> 00:41:04.595]  We just need to move forward with criminal charges against these people because this is illegal.
[00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:11.581]  But, oh, the Feds control the Justice Department, and they're, quote, guarding the voting system, so that's the problem.
[00:41:11.601 --> 00:41:11.802]  Go ahead.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.603]  Well, 100%, like I said before, this is the logical extrapolation.
[00:41:16.643 --> 00:41:20.305]  Of course, that's the reason why these people are being brought in, and now it's time to mobilize them.
[00:41:20.926 --> 00:41:23.588]  And listen, it's not even just about voting.
[00:41:24.008 --> 00:41:26.470]  I am in New York right now, okay?
[00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:33.075]  And you go to Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, not that this is breaking news, plenty of other investigative reporters have already published this stuff, but just to bring it up again,
[00:41:33.835 --> 00:41:37.398]  You're walking around Roosevelt Avenue, a place that's totally third world, by the way.
[00:41:37.639 --> 00:41:45.225]  Roosevelt Avenue is worse than any street that I ever walked down when I did the entire Illegal Alien Trail from Ecuador to the United States.
[00:41:45.405 --> 00:41:46.126]  Absolutely horrible.
[00:41:46.286 --> 00:41:49.729]  I mean, gangsters in every corner, prostitutes everywhere, people selling stolen goods.
[00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.132]  But anyway, you walk around there, and there are signs put up.
[00:41:53.372 --> 00:41:56.375]  And they say, hey, call this number and get a social security card.
[00:41:56.435 --> 00:41:57.816]  Call this number and get an ID.
[00:41:58.117 --> 00:41:58.897]  This, that, and the other thing.
[00:41:59.458 --> 00:42:00.519]  And totally illegal.
[00:42:00.859 --> 00:42:07.464]  I mean, if this was happening anywhere else, if it was American citizens doing this, you'd have the FBI or local police, somebody busting down the door.
[00:42:07.484 --> 00:42:13.909]  But these signs are plastered everywhere throughout Roosevelt Avenue, selling fraudulent identification, social security, you name it.
[00:42:14.229 --> 00:42:14.950]  Nothing's done.
[00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.211]  These signs just stay up.
[00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:17.132]  Nobody takes them down.
[00:42:17.472 --> 00:42:19.814]  And you have people that also just call out your name.
[00:42:19.854 --> 00:42:22.536]  As you're walking down the street, they call out to you and they say, hey, you need an ID.
[00:42:22.956 --> 00:42:24.898]  And so the bottom line is, the reason why I'm bringing this up,
[00:42:25.638 --> 00:42:26.820]  This is totally out in the open.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:34.971]  These people are being mobilized and they are being allowed to operate and sell fraudulent identification which will then be used to get residency and eventually to get registered to vote.
[00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:41.940]  And by the way, this is video, just an interruption to back you up, this is video from two years ago and we have video all over the state of New York.
[00:42:42.461 --> 00:42:46.943]  With the illegals being given driver's license with basically no ID, and they're allowed to fly.
[00:42:46.963 --> 00:42:47.883]  I've seen it personally.
[00:42:47.903 --> 00:42:56.547]  There's thousands of videos where the illegals, sometimes with unaccompanied children, are just babies, are just handed off to people with no IDs and just flown to God knows where.
[00:42:56.787 --> 00:43:03.750]  So this is people getting driver's license, and then they get signed up with the Democrats and paid to vote from their addresses.
[00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:09.413]  Sometimes they get called all the time, one person voting five, six, seven, eight times under different names they're given.
[00:43:09.433 --> 00:43:11.574]  So they're not just voting under their illegal name.
[00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:12.955]  They're illegal alien, real name.
[00:43:13.295 --> 00:43:21.283]  They're also being given the data mine Zuckerberg, 450 million bucks he spent to get databases of dead people and folks that have moved out of district.
[00:43:21.544 --> 00:43:25.528]  So you move out of district to another state, but you're still voting, or you're in the ground dead.
[00:43:25.968 --> 00:43:27.610]  Used to be a Republican, now you vote Democrat.
[00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:29.311]  That's right.
[00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:38.197]  And listen, here's how we know that this is being aided and abetted by the Democratic-controlled Deep State, by the leftist Marxist-controlled Deep State, right?
[00:43:38.817 --> 00:43:46.302]  We have exposed, I mentioned this in your show a few months ago, we exposed this charity, La Jornada, that was operating in
[00:43:46.462 --> 00:43:46.762]  I don't know.
[00:44:02.845 --> 00:44:07.289]  This organization received $250,000 federal taxpayer dollars.
[00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:11.572]  That was something that Congresswoman Grace Meng of that district helped to broker.
[00:44:12.173 --> 00:44:14.214]  And this organization is still operating.
[00:44:14.254 --> 00:44:20.059]  I mean, they've been exposed for handing out fraudulent residency cards, and they are still allowed to operate.
[00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:22.721]  As far as I know, no charges have been brought against them.
[00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:24.222]  They're still operating to this day.
[00:44:24.282 --> 00:44:24.843]  Why is that?
[00:44:25.103 --> 00:44:26.383]  How is that allowed to take place?
[00:44:26.403 --> 00:44:29.945]  I mean, if this was anybody else, this is any other group, they'd be shut down the next day.
[00:44:29.985 --> 00:44:35.387]  I mean, if you sell, if you're a farmer and you sell raw milk, then the FBI is going to come bust down your door.
[00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:40.108]  But if you're selling fraudulent residency cards, possibly to terrorists, I mean, who the hell knows?
[00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:42.169]  Chinese saboteurs, that's okay.
[00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:43.789]  Your organization can still operate.
[00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:50.592]  So if that doesn't show that corruption is operating on the deepest level and that the goal here is not to subvert our Republic, I don't know what will.
[00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:52.805]  Well, you're doing great work.
[00:44:53.707 --> 00:44:56.172]  What do you think we should do about this, and then what else are you working on?
[00:44:58.601 --> 00:45:01.643]  Well, to answer the first question, what do I think that we should do?
[00:45:01.683 --> 00:45:05.145]  The election's right around the corner and people need to get involved.
[00:45:05.265 --> 00:45:10.288]  I mean, when they are tabulating these votes and counting them up, people need to be on the ground, right?
[00:45:10.888 --> 00:45:15.471]  Don't let these people next time, in a couple of months, I mean, how many days is it until the election?
[00:45:15.491 --> 00:45:16.211]  A hundred something days?
[00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:19.093]  Don't let them put up the black tarps and not let us see what's going on.
[00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:19.933]  Do not stand for that.
[00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:22.395]  And to the extent it is happening, you need to put cameras in their faces.
[00:45:23.235 --> 00:45:24.916]  Mark down who these people are, right?
[00:45:25.216 --> 00:45:35.819]  I mean, I don't believe in doxing people, but find out who these people are that are putting up, you know, black wallpaper, not letting you see through the windows, not letting you see how the votes are being counted, and expose these people and put it all out there.
[00:45:36.019 --> 00:45:41.621]  And unless we have enough active people doing that, I mean, this election could very well be stolen from us.
[00:45:42.461 --> 00:45:47.223]  The more investigations we do in this matter, the less and less sure I am that we are going to have a fair election.
[00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:52.927]  It's going to take all of us to get out there and expose this, and that's really all I can say.
[00:45:52.947 --> 00:46:03.717]  I am unfortunately not elected representative, so I can't really affect change in that regard, but Elon Musk has pinned the tweet, and I know that there are some very high-level people talking about this report, so hopefully that'll help.
[00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:06.159]  As far as what I'm working on right now,
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:16.123]  We are working on a massive story regarding the trafficking of the unaccompanied children once they come into the United States.
[00:46:16.363 --> 00:46:18.404]  I think it's going to be the biggest report of its kind.
[00:46:19.264 --> 00:46:21.985]  We've obtained a list of about 8,500 names from a HHS insider
[00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:25.547]  Yeah.
[00:46:44.185 --> 00:46:54.852]  We're told stories of children in these compounds who are crying because they are just told randomly one day, hey, you're going to this sponsor and here's the state you're going to.
[00:46:55.232 --> 00:46:57.734]  And they're crying and they're saying, I have no idea who this person is.
[00:46:57.774 --> 00:46:59.375]  I don't know where I'm going and I don't want to go.
[00:46:59.936 --> 00:47:06.540]  And then one day they're just woken up in the middle of the night when they can't really create much of a fuss.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.303]  They're woken up in the middle of the night and they're just hauled off to a random place.
[00:47:10.443 --> 00:47:12.444]  That's what child traffickers do.
[00:47:12.504 --> 00:47:13.725]  This is industrialized
[00:47:15.006 --> 00:47:17.928]  Human trafficking at a scale never before seen, run by Mayorkas.
[00:47:17.988 --> 00:47:20.150]  Mayorkas is literally beyond Lex Luthor.
[00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.234]  And we are, God help us, and it shows the Democrats are going for broke.
[00:47:24.574 --> 00:47:25.755]  Here's the bad news and the good news.
[00:47:26.916 --> 00:47:30.359]  They know Trump's really 20 points ahead nationwide, more than 10 in battlegrounds.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.742]  They think with the illegal aliens, the dead people voting, it's still not enough.
[00:47:33.762 --> 00:47:34.763]  That's why they tried to kill Trump.
[00:47:35.624 --> 00:47:37.385]  But it's so close because of the fraud.
[00:47:37.405 --> 00:47:38.886]  They've got at least 10 percent banked in.
[00:47:39.835 --> 00:47:43.377]  Okay, so we've got to have maximum landslide to override this.
[00:47:43.858 --> 00:47:46.880]  We've got to have deportations of all the military age men immediately.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.462]  The country's entire future is hanging in the balance right now.
[00:47:52.863 --> 00:47:53.404]  Absolutely.
[00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:58.787]  You know, Donald Trump has talked about mass deportations when he's put in office, if he wins.
[00:47:59.107 --> 00:48:02.429]  I didn't like that he dodged that question during the first presidential debate.
[00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.511]  That was not encouraging, but that's exactly what we need.
[00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:06.092]  We need mass deportations.
[00:48:06.152 --> 00:48:07.513]  I mean, it has to be scorched earth.
[00:48:07.553 --> 00:48:09.194]  You cannot allow this to stand at all.
[00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:12.976]  I'm walking down Roosevelt Avenue yesterday, okay?
[00:48:13.337 --> 00:48:16.399]  Just to give people an idea, and I already said this, there's gangsters in every corner.
[00:48:16.419 --> 00:48:20.021]  But I'm walking down the street, and I see a guy wearing a CDG hat.
[00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:22.063]  That stands for Cartel del Golfo.
[00:48:22.103 --> 00:48:30.449]  That's the same cartel organization that kidnapped my brother and I. And listen, this guy would not be wearing that hat unless he was part of that organization, okay?
[00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:32.510]  These people aren't playing games wearing these hats for fun.
[00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.332]  It's not like a Yankees hat.
[00:48:34.832 --> 00:48:38.995]  And so, I mean, this guy wearing this hat, a golf cartel member, I glance at him.
[00:48:39.295 --> 00:48:39.475]  Right?
[00:48:39.515 --> 00:48:43.839]  I'm just moving my head, but just looking around, just doing a, you know, a pan of the area.
[00:48:44.099 --> 00:48:46.261]  And this guy starts screaming at me, threatening me.
[00:48:46.441 --> 00:48:47.722]  And these are the people that are in this country.
[00:48:47.762 --> 00:48:49.704]  That's one of hundreds of thousands.
[00:48:49.744 --> 00:48:51.945]  And so, like you said, we need mass deportations.
[00:48:51.985 --> 00:48:58.210]  And on the voter side, every single legitimate American voter needs to get out and vote this election.
[00:48:58.231 --> 00:48:59.712]  I mean, do not think that your vote doesn't matter.
[00:49:00.332 --> 00:49:01.934]  Like I said in the expose you just played,
[00:49:02.634 --> 00:49:07.916]  The margin of error in Georgia was less than 12,000 votes in the 2020 election, okay?
[00:49:08.556 --> 00:49:17.939]  We just exposed 14% of the people, and that is in line with the Rasmussen Report, of about 14%, I believe you said, registered illegal aliens, right?
[00:49:18.259 --> 00:49:19.480]  So now you extrapolate that out.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:27.104]  The estimates are, in Georgia, around 339,000 illegal aliens, non-citizens, in Georgia.
[00:49:27.124 --> 00:49:28.845]  So now, extrapolate this out.
[00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.606]  14% of that number is around 47,000.
[00:49:31.187 --> 00:49:35.929]  That's four times the margin of error that Joe Biden took the election in Georgia in 2020.
[00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:42.954]  This election, it could come down to the wire, based on all the fraud, and especially if we don't get enough voters coming out on our side.
[00:49:43.674 --> 00:49:45.135]  So we need to mobilize everybody.
[00:49:46.328 --> 00:50:04.871]  Well, again, a few more minutes on this and then promise me that you'll come on as soon as you break this huge child, human trafficking, child kidnapping information that the Congress, in a hearing a year ago, said it was 89,000 missing kids, 400,000 they brought in, even New York Times admitted many were found in slave labor and factories sleeping on floors.
[00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:08.052]  I mean, the crimes of the Democrats are just insane.
[00:50:08.092 --> 00:50:08.892]  That's what we know of.
[00:50:08.932 --> 00:50:10.512]  Imagine what we don't know about.
[00:50:10.532 --> 00:50:13.153]  Any other intel on your big report?
[00:50:13.253 --> 00:50:15.633]  And can you give us a first look on when it's coming out?
[00:50:17.228 --> 00:50:21.131]  So we are just trying to, it's got to be as impactful as possible.
[00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:24.034]  So we're just trying to gather as many more reports as we can.
[00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:27.256]  We're going to make a trip somewhere along the southern border in around a week.
[00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:31.199]  And then after that, we should have everything and we'll put it out and you guys will be the first people to know.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.041]  I'm honored to break these stories with InfoWars.
[00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:33.942]  I mean, truly.
[00:50:34.022 --> 00:50:35.603]  So you guys will be the first people to know.
[00:50:35.643 --> 00:50:37.384]  Hopefully I'll come on in person and break that with you.
[00:50:38.746 --> 00:50:40.447]  Maybe sometime this summer, I hope.
[00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:46.051]  But you know, other testimonies that we've gathered from these children is to give people a little sneak preview.
[00:50:46.832 --> 00:50:55.458]  Like I said, we've knocked on probably hundreds of doors across over 10 states, primarily west or east of the Mississippi.
[00:50:56.118 --> 00:51:03.163]  And some of these reports, I mean, countless stories, I mean, more stories than I can even recall of you knock on the door and they say, oh,
[00:51:03.783 --> 00:51:04.283]  I don't know.
[00:51:25.569 --> 00:51:30.213]  Twenty times that the kid has been given away to somebody and now the kid's gone with no idea where they went.
[00:51:30.433 --> 00:51:39.520]  Oh, we got video in Texas years ago, three years ago, where the same woman all day every hour drives and hands over babies to random people and they just disappear onto an airplane.
[00:51:40.021 --> 00:51:42.383]  Brother, as soon as this breaks, come on the show.
[00:51:43.023 --> 00:51:43.464]  Let us know.
[00:51:43.504 --> 00:51:44.684]  We want to break this with you.
[00:51:45.045 --> 00:51:45.625]  God bless you.
[00:51:45.665 --> 00:51:48.007]  Everybody should support you and pray for you and your team.

[00:53:02.214 --> 00:53:03.174]  We just private label it.
[00:53:03.194 --> 00:53:04.014]  They drop ship it.
[00:53:05.194 --> 00:53:06.875]  There's the Pain MD.

[00:53:17.078 --> 00:53:18.119]  Selling out of the X3.

[00:53:48.196 --> 00:53:49.037]  It does the opposite.
[00:53:49.057 --> 00:53:49.998]  It cleans out your cells.
[00:53:50.318 --> 00:53:51.259]  Instant amazing energy.
[00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:52.679]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.521]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:53:55.561 --> 00:54:00.685]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:54:01.852 --> 00:54:04.935]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:54:04.955 --> 00:54:07.797]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:54:07.837 --> 00:54:08.577]  How are you still in the air?
[00:54:08.738 --> 00:54:09.018]  God.
[00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.119]  But God works through people.
[00:54:12.641 --> 00:54:17.945]  So, we're in a paradox here, where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[00:54:19.646 --> 00:54:24.110]  If we're able to get a buyer out of the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.050]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:27.192]  And that's coming, that's got to be set up.
[00:54:28.373 --> 00:54:29.234]  But in the meantime,
[00:54:30.496 --> 00:54:37.541]  People believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion we're shut down.
[00:54:37.661 --> 00:54:49.009]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, we caught him.
[00:54:49.249 --> 00:54:50.310]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:54:51.811 --> 00:54:53.252]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:54:54.076 --> 00:54:54.336]  All right?
[00:54:55.137 --> 00:54:57.879]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:54:58.359 --> 00:54:59.120]  Limited supplies.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.423]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:02.643 --> 00:55:03.704]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:55:03.724 --> 00:55:04.504]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:55:05.225 --> 00:55:07.987]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:55:08.007 --> 00:55:08.648]  We need support.
[00:55:09.388 --> 00:55:10.969]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:55:10.989 --> 00:55:12.931]  We want to be symbiotic.

[00:55:20.477 --> 00:55:21.418]  We want a relationship.
[00:55:22.347 --> 00:55:28.110]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:36.214]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto and other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:55:36.654 --> 00:55:40.556]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:55:40.616 --> 00:55:41.877]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:55:42.597 --> 00:55:50.999]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line over a dozen products.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.300]  InfoWarsMD.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.201]  We've got Ashwagandha Gummi.
[00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:59.122]  Relaxes you, makes you feel really relaxed with no downer feeling.
[00:55:59.962 --> 00:56:00.382]  Amazing.
[00:56:01.202 --> 00:56:02.043]  An incredible product.

[00:56:06.184 --> 00:56:07.324]  They're all different formulas.
[00:56:07.544 --> 00:56:08.084]  People love it.
[00:56:08.244 --> 00:56:09.024]  Goodnight Sleep.

[00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:21.471]  Works really well.
[00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:22.792]  Great pain relief.
[00:56:22.972 --> 00:56:23.833]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:56:23.933 --> 00:56:24.754]  You know, jam-packed.
[00:56:25.234 --> 00:56:25.755]  It's there.
[00:56:26.275 --> 00:56:27.216]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:56:27.637 --> 00:56:28.657]  Infowars MD.
[00:56:29.038 --> 00:56:29.819]  Prostate support.
[00:56:29.859 --> 00:56:30.539]  Already mentioned that.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.461]  This is just a top formula.
[00:56:32.481 --> 00:56:33.302]  Super high quality.
[00:56:33.662 --> 00:56:34.062]  Organic.
[00:56:34.663 --> 00:56:35.524]  Nerve Renew.

[00:56:36.905 --> 00:56:39.407]  To get your nerves not to kill pain, but to get your nerves healthy.
[00:56:39.587 --> 00:56:40.288]  Nitric Boost.
[00:56:40.488 --> 00:56:41.889]  Vitamin Refusion about to sell out.
[00:56:42.089 --> 00:56:42.730]  About to sell out.
[00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.670]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.032]  And something I never talk about and should talk about more.
[00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:47.353]  Probiotic Fiber.
[00:56:47.514 --> 00:56:51.517]  A super high-end product at a low price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:51.557 --> 00:56:52.558]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:56:54.399 --> 00:56:57.562]  Trump did a great job yesterday at the NABJ.
[00:56:59.103 --> 00:57:00.684]  Big Black Journalist event.
[00:57:01.405 --> 00:57:02.806]  They came after everything they had.
[00:57:03.707 --> 00:57:04.828]  They're trying to spin it right now.
[00:57:07.045 --> 00:57:08.026]  But Trump did a great job.
[00:57:12.569 --> 00:57:13.869]  And the crowd just loved him.
[00:57:16.651 --> 00:57:21.875]  Kamala Harris, literally, her specialty was arresting black people for marijuana charges and throwing them in prison.
[00:57:23.376 --> 00:57:25.237]  And she never said she was black until now.
[00:57:25.997 --> 00:57:27.298]  And Trump is right to call that out.
[00:57:27.738 --> 00:57:28.819]  It's all just lies.
[00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:29.560]  It's all fraud.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.101]  Here was the opening.
[00:57:31.461 --> 00:57:34.423]  Shalvo, when they attacked him,
[00:57:35.883 --> 00:57:37.984]  This is a really, really, really important clip.
[00:57:38.404 --> 00:57:39.084]  It's clip one.
[00:57:40.205 --> 00:57:44.686]  President Trump spends three minutes putting on a masterclass and not taking Rachel Scott's bait.
[00:57:44.706 --> 00:57:46.307]  Here it is.
[00:57:46.667 --> 00:57:47.547]  Another had a stroke.
[00:57:48.567 --> 00:57:54.830]  Were the people who assaulted those 140 officers, including those I just mentioned, patriots who deserve pardons?
[00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:57.851]  Well, let me bring it back to modern day.
[00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:58.811]  Let's stop here.
[00:57:59.191 --> 00:58:02.452]  I got confused because that's not the clip I want to play.
[00:58:02.472 --> 00:58:03.973]  I want to get to another one in a moment.
[00:58:05.796 --> 00:58:05.996]  Clip 4.
[00:58:06.176 --> 00:58:07.037]  I want a clip.
[00:58:07.257 --> 00:58:07.958]  Clip 4.
[00:58:08.978 --> 00:58:09.399]  Here it is.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.302]  Let's just stop.
[00:58:13.482 --> 00:58:15.983]  Let's just stop now.
[00:58:16.264 --> 00:58:17.625]  I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while.
[00:58:17.645 --> 00:58:19.446]  Because I'm loaded for bear.
[00:58:19.546 --> 00:58:20.247]  I'm ready to go.
[00:58:20.387 --> 00:58:21.528]  I thought these were other clips.
[00:58:22.148 --> 00:58:23.629]  I want the opening thing.
[00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.250]  It says opening clip.
[00:58:25.771 --> 00:58:26.771]  It's not the opening clip.
[00:58:26.892 --> 00:58:27.372]  I'm okay.
[00:58:28.893 --> 00:58:30.014]  But I'm so prepared here.
[00:58:30.854 --> 00:58:31.715]  And I sent the clips.
[00:58:33.536 --> 00:58:33.877]  It's clip 4.
[00:58:38.075 --> 00:58:39.096]  And I'm totally confused.
[00:58:39.296 --> 00:58:40.557]  So I gotta go to rebroadcast.
[00:58:41.077 --> 00:58:42.378]  I gotta find the clips and send them to you.
[00:58:53.525 --> 00:58:54.526]  I just can't do this anymore.
[00:58:55.266 --> 00:58:56.107]  I just can't do it anymore.
[00:58:57.268 --> 00:58:58.449]  There's just too much information.
[00:58:58.669 --> 00:58:59.249]  God Almighty.
[00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:01.410]  This whole thing's just gonna blow up.
[00:59:04.192 --> 00:59:04.993]  I'll send the clip again.
[00:59:06.687 --> 00:59:07.888]  It's how they open the conference up.
[00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:10.812]  I don't know how we play two clubs.
[00:59:10.832 --> 00:59:11.693]  It's not the club I wanted.
[00:59:15.397 --> 00:59:16.318]  Just just air something.
[00:59:16.338 --> 00:59:17.079]  We'll see what's going to happen.
[00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:19.842]  Just I'll give you guys some time to figure out what you're going to hear.
[00:59:21.403 --> 00:59:22.184]  Just just play something.
[00:59:22.204 --> 00:59:22.865]  Okay, we're done.
[00:59:23.406 --> 00:59:23.646]  Thank you.
[00:59:28.777 --> 00:59:32.698]  In Venezuela, many are calling the recent elections fraud.
[00:59:33.038 --> 00:59:40.041]  The country's electoral authority, or CNE, said Maduro had won a third six-year term with 51% of the vote.
[00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:43.402]  The election authority said González won 44%.
[00:59:45.122 --> 00:59:55.306]  But opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said González had secured 70% of the vote and that multiple independent exit polls and quick counts decisively showed his victory.
[00:59:55.746 --> 01:00:01.669]  Multiple research firms had exit polls showing Gonzalez getting over 60% of the vote.
[01:00:01.949 --> 01:00:10.813]  As for poll data, Gonzalez has a staggering support of almost 60% of the voters, while Maduro has just under 13% voters in his favor.
[01:00:11.634 --> 01:00:15.516]  The current leadership is not popular and the people took to the streets.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.161]  There is video of people getting shot by government troops.
[01:00:52.181 --> 01:01:05.408]  There are videos that show the police taking off uniforms and standing with the people.
[01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:36.008]  All right, the full report that he did on this is on Bandai Video.
[01:01:36.048 --> 01:01:37.229]  I'm back, I'm focused.
[01:01:38.169 --> 01:01:43.811]  I'm just overwhelmed with information just like everybody else is and I'm pissed because stuff's about to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:45.311]  All right, get ready.
[01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:47.352]  We got a ton of information, a huge guest coming up.
[01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:48.252]  Stay with us.
[01:01:48.976 --> 01:01:54.597]  We are now into our number two, and I wanted to show the video you see on screen from the start.
[01:01:56.078 --> 01:02:01.539]  Because Trump walks out at the National Association of Black Broadcasters in Chicago.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.420]  They lied to him and said Biden or Kamala would be there.
[01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:11.202]  He sits down and then she, and we'll go to the Better HD clip where she actually goes after him.
[01:02:11.722 --> 01:02:15.303]  He sits down and then she goes right at him.
[01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.245]  First, you're illegitimate.
[01:02:18.265 --> 01:02:19.706]  We probably shouldn't even have you here.
[01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:21.226]  They're lucky he's there.
[01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:28.249]  So they invite somebody, then they attack him once he gets there, and then says a bunch of lies about him.
[01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:33.210]  Oh, you've attacked black prosecutors.
[01:02:35.891 --> 01:02:36.891]  Black prosecutors?
[01:02:37.932 --> 01:02:39.972]  He's attacked the white ones like Jack Smith too.
[01:02:40.012 --> 01:02:40.672]  What does that have to do with it?
[01:02:40.812 --> 01:02:42.013]  They're trying to put him in prison.
[01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:45.254]  They're lying about him.
[01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:50.840]  Then Kamala always said she was an Indian, not that she was black.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.160]  If she's part black, good, be proud of it.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:53.900]  Tell us you're black.
[01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:56.721]  No, she's just been black the last few years.
[01:03:00.062 --> 01:03:03.662]  And they want to say if he wants to criticize her, he's criticizing a black woman.
[01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:12.424]  Well, you're in the arena, you're running for political office, you're a horrible person, I don't care if you're white, or brown, or red, or whatever you are.
[01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.885]  You're a lying sack of garbage.
[01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:21.631]  And if Donald Trump was black and was the same man did the same stuff, I'd support him.
[01:03:25.332 --> 01:03:26.773]  So that's the reality here.
[01:03:27.793 --> 01:03:29.614]  But it was a powerful event yesterday.
[01:03:29.634 --> 01:03:31.194]  And I want to go to the opening question.
[01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.115]  Seconds after he sits down.
[01:03:34.915 --> 01:03:36.576]  This is the desperate power structure.
[01:03:37.657 --> 01:03:41.682]  Going after, but now the media is spinning it like, oh, disaster at this black event.
[01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:42.502]  It was the opposite.
[01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:43.704]  It was the real Donald Trump.
[01:03:44.304 --> 01:03:44.985]  It was amazing.
[01:03:45.506 --> 01:03:48.129]  And I'd say 80% of the support, you could hear it in the crowd.
[01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:49.510]  Can't hear any boos.
[01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:50.391]  You hear a bunch of support.
[01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:50.712]  Here it is.
[01:03:52.469 --> 01:03:57.391]  You have told four Congresswomen of color who were American citizens to go back to where they came from.
[01:03:58.192 --> 01:04:02.714]  You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys.
[01:04:03.314 --> 01:04:09.237]  You've attacked black journalists, calling them a loser, saying the questions that they ask are, quote, stupid and racist.
[01:04:09.897 --> 01:04:12.579]  You've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort.
[01:04:13.479 --> 01:04:23.081]  So my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, why should black voters trust you after you have used language like that?
[01:04:23.101 --> 01:04:31.704]  Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question so, in such a horrible manner, a first question.
[01:04:32.624 --> 01:04:35.164]  You don't even say, hello, how are you?
[01:04:35.865 --> 01:04:36.945]  Are you with ABC?
[01:04:36.985 --> 01:04:40.106]  Because I think they're a fake news network, a terrible network.
[01:04:42.987 --> 01:04:47.350]  I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit.
[01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.711]  I love the black population of this country.
[01:04:50.792 --> 01:05:05.300]  I've done so much for the black population of this country, including employment, including Opportunity Zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs ever for
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.061]  I think it's a very rude introduction.
[01:05:27.328 --> 01:05:28.048]  We're good to go.
[01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:49.556]  You know, where's Zoom?
[01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:51.677]  She's gonna do it with Zoom and she's not coming.
[01:05:52.137 --> 01:05:53.238]  And then you were half an hour late.
[01:05:53.378 --> 01:05:56.379]  Just so we understand, I have too much respect for you to be late.
[01:05:56.679 --> 01:05:59.780]  They couldn't get their equipment working or something was wrong.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.581]  I think it's a very nasty question.
[01:06:02.641 --> 01:06:03.801]  I have answered the question.
[01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:10.944]  I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln.
[01:06:11.144 --> 01:06:12.184]  That's my answer.
[01:06:12.244 --> 01:06:13.986]  Well, Trump just tore the living hell out of that establishment hag.
[01:06:14.006 --> 01:06:15.247]  I don't dislike her because she's black.
[01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.028]  I dislike her because she read off a script she had.
[01:06:35.427 --> 01:06:37.809]  And Trump went on to say, you know, he's not sure of Kamala Harris.
[01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:38.889]  Like, you're attacking a black woman.
[01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:40.290]  Well, I'm not sure if she's Indian or black.
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.271]  She always said she was Indian.
[01:06:41.871 --> 01:06:43.052]  They go, oh, that's a racial attack.
[01:06:43.092 --> 01:06:44.272]  They make it all racial.
[01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:49.956]  She starts out, you're mean to black prosecutors that are setting him up to put him in jail.
[01:06:50.316 --> 01:06:51.537]  He's also mean to the white ones.
[01:06:51.577 --> 01:06:52.157]  They deserve it.
[01:06:53.178 --> 01:06:54.519]  Oh, you're trying to put me in jail.
[01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:55.499]  You're lying about me.
[01:06:55.519 --> 01:06:56.460]  You're trying to destroy my life.
[01:06:57.741 --> 01:07:01.083]  I shouldn't fight back and speak out against you because you're black.
[01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:02.544]  What the hell does that even mean?
[01:07:05.165 --> 01:07:06.646]  This just goes against common sense.
[01:07:06.726 --> 01:07:07.826]  They make it racial.
[01:07:09.647 --> 01:07:25.792]  Nobody, when Trump doesn't like Fannie Willis or Alvin Bragg that Soros put in office because he wants black front people to do his dirty work, nobody thinks, not the average person, well why is Trump talking bad about Fannie Willis?
[01:07:25.832 --> 01:07:28.313]  Because she rigged the damn trial trying to put his ass in prison.
[01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:29.593]  What the?
[01:07:30.554 --> 01:07:31.494]  They attack Trump
[01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:37.710]  And then he's not even supposed to defend himself.
[01:07:39.631 --> 01:07:42.112]  Absolutely insane.
[01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:44.294]  Here's Trump on the border.
[01:07:45.658 --> 01:07:47.920]  They're coming in, and they're coming in, they're invading.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.723]  It's an invasion of millions of people, probably 15, 16, 17 million people.
[01:07:53.144 --> 01:07:54.885]  I have a feeling it's much more than that.
[01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:57.647]  And everybody's been seeing what's happened.
[01:07:58.027 --> 01:08:04.973]  The first group of people, the black population, is affected most by that, and Kamala is allowing it to happen.
[01:08:04.993 --> 01:08:05.954]  She's the border czar.
[01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:08.015]  She's the worst border czar in the history of the world.
[01:08:08.035 --> 01:08:09.576]  There's never been a border czar like this.
[01:08:09.937 --> 01:08:11.498]  She's never even essentially been.
[01:08:11.518 --> 01:08:14.140]  She said she was there once, but not the right part of the border.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.901]  So she was a border there.
[01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.902]  She's done a horrible job.
[01:08:17.202 --> 01:08:22.366]  These people are coming into our country and they're taking black jobs and Hispanic jobs.
[01:08:22.726 --> 01:08:24.507]  And frankly, they're taking union jobs.
[01:08:24.627 --> 01:08:29.711]  Unions are being very badly affected by all of the millions of people that are pouring into our country.
[01:08:29.771 --> 01:08:31.573]  And one thing as we as we discussed.
[01:08:32.353 --> 01:08:38.555]  Many of these people are coming in from mental institutions, from prisons, from jails, they're gang members in other countries.
[01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:53.899]  Other countries are setting loose their prisoners, they're opening up their prisons and their mental institutions, and they're taking their bad people, drug dealers, gang members, and they're bringing them into the United States.
[01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:59.121]  And by the way, their crime rate is going down, and our crime rate is going to be a disaster.
[01:08:59.141 --> 01:08:59.581]  Mr. President?
[01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:02.441]  Well, there you go.
[01:09:03.962 --> 01:09:05.702]  Here's Trump on Kamala.
[01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:07.743]  And I've got all the articles right here.
[01:09:07.863 --> 01:09:09.043]  She didn't say she was black.
[01:09:09.924 --> 01:09:14.465]  And now she's doing that thing Hillary Clinton does when she gets up in front of a black audience.
[01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:24.668]  She like then affects some what she thinks is like ghetto black accent.
[01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:29.790]  I mean, I would be insulted if somebody from New York came down here to speak to, let's say, Texas.
[01:09:30.956 --> 01:09:37.399]  And it's just a crowd of Texans and somebody that normally has a New York accent gets up and says, how you doing today?
[01:09:37.539 --> 01:09:39.000]  I want to eat some possum.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.022]  I tell you what I rode to work day on a horsey.
[01:09:43.922 --> 01:09:45.403]  I'm married to my sister.
[01:09:48.864 --> 01:09:49.985]  I got an outhouse.
[01:09:54.192 --> 01:10:03.575]  But instead, these Democrat politicians, who normally speak in whatever their real accent is, get in front of black people and they start doing some caricature.
[01:10:06.236 --> 01:10:08.377]  How everybody doing today out there?
[01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.217]  Good to be here with you.
[01:10:10.297 --> 01:10:20.741]  I mean, like, because they're psychos, they're not real people, they're sociopaths bare minimum, and they think that if somebody talks like, imagine if I went and spoke to a group of, say, Chinese Americans.
[01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:24.292]  They asked me to come speak to them.
[01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:30.915]  And I showed up, and I went, Hello, how you doing?
[01:10:31.715 --> 01:10:33.195]  I am here for you.
[01:10:33.555 --> 01:10:36.496]  Would you like some rice ball for you?
[01:10:36.636 --> 01:10:39.917]  Or imagine, instead of like a rock song,
[01:10:46.098 --> 01:11:03.325]  Let's say an Asian-American group asks Trump to come speak, and instead of him playing a rock song coming out or whatever he wants to do, he plays... I mean, it's just... It's so patronizing.
[01:11:04.585 --> 01:11:14.209]  And I've not hung out with liberals a lot in my life, but in college, some, and places, you're with some white liberals, and you go into a Mexican food restaurant, and the waiter comes over, and they go,
[01:11:16.175 --> 01:11:16.675]  To the waiter.
[01:11:16.775 --> 01:11:18.716]  The waiter doesn't even have an Hispanic accent.
[01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:19.636]  Hi, Bob.
[01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:20.337]  What would you like?
[01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.077]  What do you want to drink?
[01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:23.418]  How are you?
[01:11:24.598 --> 01:11:26.399]  I would like a taco.
[01:11:26.599 --> 01:11:26.799]  Hmm?
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.000]  I mean, you know, they talk real slow.
[01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:32.782]  Do you, do you get me iced tea?
[01:11:32.862 --> 01:11:35.423]  Do you know, do you know how to talk?
[01:11:35.503 --> 01:11:35.763]  Hmm?
[01:11:37.004 --> 01:11:41.786]  So, I mean, imagine if I, let's say the NAACP asked me to come speak.
[01:11:43.426 --> 01:11:44.967]  And, I mean, I'd walk up there and talk like I talk.
[01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:50.830]  Instead I'm going to say, how's everybody doing today?
[01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:53.171]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:11:56.953 --> 01:12:02.396]  So let's play just the raw clip of her talking in a weird, she thinks ghetto accent.
[01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.793]  And then, let's play the clip of her side-by-side with Hillary in one of her famous stills.
[01:12:07.813 --> 01:12:12.997]  Because if Hillary's talking to rednecks, she literally walks out and goes, How's everybody doing today?
[01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:16.899]  Like I said, I just killed me a possum and I'm gonna cook it.
[01:12:16.979 --> 01:12:18.540]  Looks like granny.
[01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.443]  Where's Jethro?
[01:12:22.803 --> 01:12:24.765]  I guess he's in the cement pond.
[01:12:28.018 --> 01:12:32.999]  But if Hillary's talking to black people, she goes, Hello everybody, how you doing today?
[01:12:33.019 --> 01:12:35.260]  It's like, what the hell is this?
[01:12:36.941 --> 01:12:44.223]  Or imagine, if you go visit Germany, and you walk into a restaurant and they say, What would you like to order?
[01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:50.665]  Well, I would like to order a... A beer.
[01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:54.546]  And I would like to order some beef.
[01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:58.896]  And I would like to order some Schreidenhacken.
[01:13:02.601 --> 01:13:03.542]  They would think you were insane.
[01:13:06.687 --> 01:13:08.810]  Or if you're in France, you want to order a bottle of wine.
[01:13:10.299 --> 01:13:11.380]  The waiter walks over all pissed off.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.660]  What would you like to order?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.923]  And you say, When, my friend, I would like to order a Pinot Noir.
[01:13:18.983 --> 01:13:21.024]  What would you recommend, my friend?
[01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:25.446]  And then you go even further and just kind of affect with their voice or something like that.
[01:13:25.586 --> 01:13:28.128]  And you go, I'm going to stop right now.
[01:13:28.188 --> 01:13:28.988]  Here's the club server.
[01:13:39.465 --> 01:13:43.631]  You believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is a black woman?
[01:13:43.732 --> 01:13:46.776]  Well, I can say, no, I think it's maybe a little bit different.
[01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:52.705]  So, I've known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much, and
[01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:58.753]  She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.
[01:13:58.853 --> 01:14:05.117]  I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black.
[01:14:05.678 --> 01:14:06.258]  So I don't know.
[01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.899]  Is she Indian or is she black?
[01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:11.241]  She is always identified as a black.
[01:14:11.341 --> 01:14:13.723]  I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't.
[01:14:14.243 --> 01:14:20.047]  Because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went, she became a black woman.
[01:14:20.427 --> 01:14:31.269]  Just to be clear, sir, do you believe- I think somebody should look into that, too, when you ask a continue in a very hostile- And you all helped us win in 2020, and we're gonna do it again in 2024!
[01:14:31.309 --> 01:14:31.849]  Yes, we will.
[01:14:31.889 --> 01:14:39.211]  Yes, we will.
[01:14:39.471 --> 01:14:43.252]  So let's get- I don't feel no ways tired.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:59.246]  The voice she's doing is like a cross between White Hillbilly and I guess Southern Black?
[01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:19.592]  But that is like, I just couldn't imagine.
[01:15:20.693 --> 01:15:29.381]  Again, I get asked to speak in front of the Japanese American Business Association.
[01:15:30.612 --> 01:15:56.396]  And they have me on top of the economy and I walk in and I go... And I'll have a hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:15:58.859 --> 01:16:04.642]  I mean, that is what we're talking about here.
[01:16:04.662 --> 01:16:07.123]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[01:16:07.143 --> 01:16:09.504]  I'm going to stop.
[01:16:11.045 --> 01:16:21.430]  I've got a clip, though, and a lady at Alina Habba speaks directly to Kamala Harris at Trump rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.810]  Here it is.
[01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:28.748]  But I'm so excited because when I spoke at the RNC, I didn't know she was the one we were going after, but now I do.
[01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.650]  And I'm gonna speak to you, Ms.
[01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:31.150]  Harris.
[01:16:39.498 --> 01:16:46.045]  I am a strong woman, a mom, a lawyer, and an American.
[01:16:52.336 --> 01:16:57.700]  And unlike you, Kamala, I know who my roots are.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.381]  I know where I come from.
[01:16:59.401 --> 01:17:02.443]  And I don't play around with the Constitution.
[01:17:11.649 --> 01:17:13.130]  And I've got some news for you.
[01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.331]  They have tried to take down President Trump.
[01:17:15.391 --> 01:17:21.095]  And like I've been saying for three years, you can keep trying, but you will not succeed.
[01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:34.400]  We will take down the corrupt DAs, the corrupt AGs, and I don't care how much money you've got behind you.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:43.050]  The truth comes out and President Trump has been and is innocent of any crime other than loving this country.
[01:17:55.859 --> 01:17:58.240]  Now let me tell you what, Kamala.
[01:18:01.342 --> 01:18:02.943]  You are committing a crime.
[01:18:03.883 --> 01:18:10.306]  Because the only co-conspirator I know of the Biden-Harris administration is you.
[01:18:10.706 --> 01:18:15.709]  And you have lied to us about President Biden for the last three and a half years.
[01:18:22.412 --> 01:18:24.314]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[01:18:24.714 --> 01:18:32.680]  I've got a lot of economic news, poison vaccine news, world news that I want to get to ahead of our special guest.
[01:18:36.743 --> 01:18:43.568]  We have Pastor Brandon Biggs, who predicted months and months before Trump was shot in the ear that he would be shot in the ear in a vision again.
[01:18:44.389 --> 01:18:47.291]  Very interesting fellow, and he's got his other co-pastor joining us.
[01:18:48.383 --> 01:18:52.707]  As well to talk about this because it's an amazing prediction and you can't ignore it.
[01:18:53.147 --> 01:18:54.289]  He's got new predictions.
[01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.251]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:18:57.391 --> 01:19:02.536]  Then another pastor, Drew Hernandez, will be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:19:04.738 --> 01:19:09.302]  But let's shift gears now to the culture war.
[01:19:11.324 --> 01:19:14.327]  And let's talk about what's happening there because if the social engineers
[01:19:15.748 --> 01:19:37.158]  Can get us to believe 2 plus 2 equals 7, like 1984, or that two men can have a baby, or that in boxing, in the Olympics, that a biological male can literally beat the living hell out of a woman, and that the woman is a sore sport because she quit after 49 seconds of having her head beat in.
[01:19:38.098 --> 01:19:39.899]  We will put up with anything.
[01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:49.781]  But it is an anti-woman, anti-child, anti-God, anti-family, anti-human pedo-cult that BlackRock, through its ESG, is funding worldwide.
[01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:57.404]  So you wonder why everything from Tractor Supply to Disney to Harley-Davidson to Anheuser-Busch promotes this stuff.
[01:19:57.744 --> 01:20:01.506]  It's because BlackRock will cut your funds off and come after you.
[01:20:01.586 --> 01:20:05.427]  And the litmus test is, do you let women get pushed out of sports?
[01:20:05.447 --> 01:20:07.008]  Do you let men go in women's bathrooms?
[01:20:07.668 --> 01:20:09.970]  Because that's a test of globalist culture.
[01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:17.114]  If you'll put up with that, you will put up with anything.
[01:20:20.056 --> 01:20:29.803]  I mean, I can't believe when she quit after 49 seconds and said in Italian, it's not fair, that she even got up there to be the loser while they raised the man's arm up above her.
[01:20:31.567 --> 01:20:34.489]  Olympic boxer deemed to have male chromosomes.
[01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:36.371]  Wins fight in 46 seconds.
[01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:38.833]  Opponent leapt in tears after hard hits.
[01:20:38.893 --> 01:20:39.994]  I mean, look at the dude.
[01:20:41.235 --> 01:20:44.118]  And he even menaces her afterwards.
[01:20:48.581 --> 01:20:55.147]  Angela Carini abandons Olympic fight for 46 seconds against the man.
[01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.148]  He can't compete against men, but he can sure beat up girls.
[01:21:00.928 --> 01:21:03.190]  Olympic boxing is having a fight about gender.
[01:21:04.071 --> 01:21:05.472]  That's how Time Magazine spends it.
[01:21:06.072 --> 01:21:20.923]  Algerian boxer Iman Khalif wins fight at Olympics after being cleared to compete in women's events despite LGBT fight as Italian opponent abandons bout.
[01:21:23.085 --> 01:21:25.807]  Boxer brings issue of Olympics gender testing to surface.
[01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:35.689]  Disgusting.
[01:21:35.889 --> 01:21:37.310]  Women need to boycott all this.
[01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:38.550]  We all need to boycott this.
[01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:43.592]  If you need to know anything else about the Olympics, it's this right here.
[01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.692]  They even got him adjusting his junk.
[01:21:47.113 --> 01:21:48.273]  Gotta get his pee-pee in order.
[01:21:50.094 --> 01:21:50.874]  That's a dude!
[01:21:50.894 --> 01:21:52.494]  And look, it's a mean dude.
[01:21:53.315 --> 01:21:54.155]  All snarling.
[01:21:55.555 --> 01:21:58.676]  And then after she quits, he comes over and walks by her like he's gonna hit her again.
[01:21:59.316 --> 01:22:00.957]  Man, you're a real tough guy, buddy boy.
[01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:11.029]  You know, I'm out of shape, but I guarantee I'd get in a ring and beat, I'd knock that son of a bitch out in three seconds.
[01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.911]  I'd punch him so hard in the jaw, right underneath the jaw, I'd break his teeth off.
[01:22:15.152 --> 01:22:17.993]  Doesn't even matter if he's wearing that stupid-ass mouth guard.
[01:22:18.013 --> 01:22:20.755]  I'll break his jaw so fast, he'll make his head spin.
[01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:23.176]  I'll break my hand on his ugly head.
[01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:24.837]  Son of a bitch.
[01:22:25.297 --> 01:22:25.978]  Piece of shit.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:29.840]  Absolute...
[01:22:31.121 --> 01:22:32.421]  Disgusting cockroach.
[01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:35.042]  Go ahead and play the 46 second fight.
[01:22:35.082 --> 01:22:35.462]  Here it is.
[01:22:52.085 --> 01:22:54.306]  We've got some slowdowns of it I sent you guys.
[01:22:54.546 --> 01:22:55.006]  And then look!
[01:22:56.006 --> 01:22:59.867]  Look, a dude, he's actually proud that he beat up a girl.
[01:23:02.088 --> 01:23:03.049]  These people are sick.
[01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:04.650]  Look at that.
[01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:05.270]  Boom!
[01:23:06.651 --> 01:23:07.712]  Punches her right in the mouth.
[01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:09.293]  I mean, look at it.
[01:23:10.754 --> 01:23:11.714]  Look how sick he looks.
[01:23:12.055 --> 01:23:13.396]  Back it up five, three seconds.
[01:23:13.436 --> 01:23:14.957]  Look at the evil look on his face.
[01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:16.337]  Go frame for frame.
[01:23:16.357 --> 01:23:19.199]  Look at this smile right here.
[01:23:19.239 --> 01:23:20.340]  Roll through frame by frame.
[01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:22.401]  I want to show his smile.
[01:23:24.002 --> 01:23:24.683]  Look at that face.
[01:23:24.723 --> 01:23:25.183]  Hit pause.
[01:23:25.624 --> 01:23:27.905]  Ooh, that face was getting me going right there, man.
[01:23:27.945 --> 01:23:28.986]  I got in a ring with that guy.
[01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:31.998]  Oh my goodness, look at that face.
[01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:33.878]  A predator.
[01:23:34.918 --> 01:23:39.700]  Beating up women on international television, and he's proud of himself.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:48.562]  He gets to go to the Olympics, beat up women for the qualifiers, get in the ring, and beat up a woman, and then get a gold medal.
[01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:54.284]  And I know I sent you the tape, because there's a longer clip I sent you of the whole thing.
[01:23:55.224 --> 01:23:57.465]  After she gives up and says it's not fair in Italian,
[01:23:59.491 --> 01:24:04.516]  He menaces her and laughs at her and walks by her.
[01:24:04.596 --> 01:24:06.698]  What do you expect?
[01:24:07.059 --> 01:24:13.986]  What type of man would beat up women in boxing and go menace them?
[01:24:15.177 --> 01:24:15.857]  No shame!
[01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:19.739]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[01:24:19.759 --> 01:24:21.760]  This is a real attempt to stop World War III.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.741]  This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children.
[01:24:24.761 --> 01:24:27.783]  Because there's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:24:28.123 --> 01:24:35.366]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening, and join it, and promote it, and support Trump, and support us, and spread the word.
[01:24:35.406 --> 01:24:39.988]  Because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission, and you get committed, and you take action.
[01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.789]  So tell everybody about the links at RolexJones.

[01:25:09.493 --> 01:25:10.614]  This is a war!
[01:25:16.405 --> 01:25:28.555]  Imane Khalif is the definition of a piece of filth beating up a woman on international TV, snarling at her, celebrating, and then proudly getting a gold medal.
[01:25:28.575 --> 01:25:33.139]  I mean, I'm laughing because I don't want to cry here.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.601]  The Olympics is a total joke.
[01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:40.525]  Look at this guy's face as he punches a woman in the face.
[01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.749]  That is such a monster right there.
[01:25:47.435 --> 01:25:52.137]  And these perverts and these sickos, some want to beat women, some want to rape women.
[01:25:53.518 --> 01:25:54.138]  They're everywhere.
[01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:58.581]  And they're full on in the government, the Pentagon, other governments.
[01:25:58.601 --> 01:25:59.261]  They're just everywhere.
[01:25:59.301 --> 01:26:00.061]  It's a damn cult!
[01:26:01.842 --> 01:26:02.803]  And I differentiate.
[01:26:03.103 --> 01:26:13.148]  If some man wants to be a woman, and they're a nice person, and they're not politically actively trying to go out and convince kids to do it, and trying to beat women up, then I'm like, hey, live your life.
[01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:13.708]  I'm not your enemy.
[01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.310]  I don't hate those people.
[01:26:18.191 --> 01:26:30.453]  I mean, people have a right with their own bodies to do what they want, but you do not have a right to take over women's sports and come in women's bathrooms because you're a predator.
[01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:32.774]  I mean, imagine, he's a psycho predator.
[01:26:33.174 --> 01:26:41.355]  Imagine, out of eight and a half billion people, they've gotten enough men that want to go take over cycling and swimming and wrestling and boxing and weightlifting.
[01:26:41.815 --> 01:26:43.896]  And I said this is what happened a decade ago when this started.
[01:26:45.296 --> 01:26:45.936]  I said, soon,
[01:26:47.225 --> 01:26:49.987]  No biological women will be winning anything.
[01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:52.748]  I mean, look at that lunatic.
[01:26:52.768 --> 01:26:53.348]  Look at his face.
[01:26:55.610 --> 01:27:00.793]  And imagine being the trainers and the people that are part of this and involved in all this.
[01:27:02.453 --> 01:27:04.114]  It is a cult of sickos.
[01:27:06.196 --> 01:27:07.256]  Boycott the Olympics.
[01:27:07.316 --> 01:27:08.317]  Boycott BlackRock.
[01:27:08.377 --> 01:27:10.998]  Boycott everything they stand for because they want your children.
[01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:13.540]  They're a devil cult.
[01:27:15.641 --> 01:27:15.741]  And
[01:27:17.307 --> 01:27:18.768]  It doesn't even sound real.
[01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:22.211]  This young lady trained for a decade since she was a little girl.
[01:27:22.991 --> 01:27:25.073]  And won all these championships boxing other women.
[01:27:27.194 --> 01:27:33.539]  And then... She climbs in the ring with a biological male, a Muslim, of course.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.821]  But it's not just the Muslims, it's happening everywhere.
[01:27:37.862 --> 01:27:39.484]  And he beats the living hell out of her.
[01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.625]  They've had cases where they've killed women.
[01:27:43.366 --> 01:27:43.927]  Killed women!
[01:27:46.008 --> 01:27:46.529]  In these rinks.
[01:27:48.803 --> 01:27:49.963]  And you ask, why do they do this?
[01:27:50.023 --> 01:27:52.424]  Because the sky is the limit.
[01:27:53.005 --> 01:27:55.606]  They want to see what they can get us to put up with.
[01:27:55.986 --> 01:27:58.327]  And the craziest thing the globalists can come up with is this.
[01:28:00.287 --> 01:28:05.509]  And then mainstream media reports on it like, well, there's a little debate about it, you know.
[01:28:05.529 --> 01:28:07.370]  But we love women.
[01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:09.471]  The globalists don't like women.
[01:28:09.491 --> 01:28:10.671]  They want to destroy women.
[01:28:11.972 --> 01:28:13.792]  They want to inject you with poison shots.
[01:28:13.812 --> 01:28:14.913]  They want to sterilize you.
[01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:21.157]  Like Elon Musk said about his son who's being sterilized as we speak.
[01:28:21.757 --> 01:28:22.818]  His son is dead.
[01:28:24.918 --> 01:28:30.040]  He sent his son because his wife wanted to to an elite school.
[01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:34.982]  And the elite school brainwashed his child.
[01:28:37.602 --> 01:28:39.803]  And they took his child away from him and they sterilized him.
[01:28:41.163 --> 01:28:42.404]  And now you got Elon Musk to deal with.
[01:28:43.044 --> 01:28:45.685]  But think about the cult.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:29:02.908]  Like, okay, if you're gonna go sterilize people's kids and make millions of dollars over their lifetimes, ruin their lives, and your whole CIA cult, do you think messing with one of the most powerful people in the world is a good idea?
[01:29:03.048 --> 01:29:04.529]  No, they don't have any sense.
[01:29:09.112 --> 01:29:10.472]  To them, it was a bigger win.
[01:29:10.933 --> 01:29:13.394]  Oh, we've got Elon Musk, firstborn son.
[01:29:15.145 --> 01:29:20.469]  Instead of cutting his scalp off, the sign of our power, we'll chemically destroy him.
[01:29:25.692 --> 01:29:27.013]  So his testicles never drop.
[01:29:29.415 --> 01:29:33.678]  And then they'll try to convince him to cut him off.
[01:29:34.318 --> 01:29:36.099]  Oh, you're depressed because you were chemically?
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:40.823]  You need a vagina, a big bleeding, fake, rotting thing.
[01:29:42.642 --> 01:29:50.485]  And then with the women, they cut the little girl's forearms off, and they make a big, rotting... Almost all of them fall off in a few months.
[01:29:51.405 --> 01:29:52.646]  Little girl, because eventually she's a boy.
[01:29:53.086 --> 01:30:02.550]  And so they give them testosterone, and then they cut their forearms off, and they make... I've shown the photos.
[01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:04.250]  You wanna see them?
[01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:09.252]  A big, rotting thing with no feeling in it, with a plastic tube in it.
[01:30:09.932 --> 01:30:11.253]  So you have a rotting...
[01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:18.851]  Stinking blob in your pants.
[01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:26.293]  I mean, it's bad enough to cut these little boys' penises off.
[01:30:27.753 --> 01:30:41.816]  But man, what they do to the little girls, cut their breasts off, cut their uteruses out, and then they give them a fake penis of forearm muscle and skin?
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:50.624]  Guys, type in female to male, because you're not really a male.
[01:30:50.644 --> 01:30:52.886]  It's like saying you're, you know, South Park episode.
[01:30:56.008 --> 01:30:56.529]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:59.431]  The forearm flap.
[01:31:00.812 --> 01:31:06.897]  Yeah, they cut the forearms off, cut the muscles out of your forearms, so they basically totally screws up.
[01:31:07.237 --> 01:31:08.398]  Your arms don't work anymore either.
[01:31:08.998 --> 01:31:10.860]  So they basically half amputate your arms.
[01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:15.146]  And then, because they're so sick, I've seen the actual videos of the surgery.
[01:31:15.166 --> 01:31:20.567]  They always create some, like, giant, foot-long, rotting thing with a plastic tube in it.
[01:31:22.368 --> 01:31:25.709]  I mean, who comes up with this?
[01:31:25.769 --> 01:31:34.531]  It's like, imagine a Hellraiser movie 20 years ago, and Hellraiser is grabbing kids and cutting their forearms off and making rotting penises.
[01:31:38.112 --> 01:31:41.073]  And folks, we have video of the actual surgeries.
[01:31:41.093 --> 01:31:41.873]  Would you like to see it?
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.022]  And then when you tell them they're abused by a cult, they turn around and say, you're being hateful.
[01:31:51.463 --> 01:31:56.466]  I want a rotting penis that falls off that has no feeling.
[01:31:58.536 --> 01:31:59.737]  Oh, doctor, thank you!
[01:32:00.318 --> 01:32:05.662]  You gave me a rotting blob of meat with skin wrapped around it with a plastic catheter shoved into me.
[01:32:05.922 --> 01:32:06.783]  How beautiful!
[01:32:07.184 --> 01:32:07.884]  How liberal!
[01:32:08.184 --> 01:32:08.885]  How loving!
[01:32:08.905 --> 01:32:12.208]  I mean, that's Kamala Harris, a huge booster of this.
[01:32:12.268 --> 01:32:14.970]  Like, I can't even believe I'm on air talking about this.
[01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:19.574]  And then a doctor, he's a lister, he's not gonna come on until after his trial.
[01:32:19.814 --> 01:32:25.800]  The feds are trying to put him in prison for seven years for exposing a hospital in Texas
[01:32:28.373 --> 01:32:32.656]  That is illegally cutting the penises off of five-year-old and six-year-old boys.
[01:32:33.217 --> 01:32:35.258]  And the law says you can't do that here, but they're doing it.
[01:32:40.642 --> 01:32:45.625]  And they just had a cycling championship last week, and all three winners were biological males.
[01:32:47.767 --> 01:32:53.451]  So the women now go to the side, whoever makes it fourth, fifth, and sixth, and they give themselves medals.
[01:32:55.052 --> 01:32:57.114]  But don't worry, more men are coming, so you won't even get
[01:32:58.117 --> 01:32:58.917]  4th, 5th, and 6th.
[01:32:59.337 --> 01:33:01.658]  Then you won't get 7th, 8th, and 9th.
[01:33:06.439 --> 01:33:12.720]  I mean, this is a absolute vision of hell.
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:20.861]  And then by peer pressure, they sit there and tell you, this is all good.
[01:33:21.001 --> 01:33:23.422]  And yeah, the crew and I talked about this a year ago said, you didn't know?
[01:33:24.442 --> 01:33:25.382]  The new Hellraiser
[01:33:26.883 --> 01:33:28.203]  Is a girl to man.
[01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.784]  And I guess that's from it.
[01:33:32.185 --> 01:33:32.485]  So.
[01:33:35.586 --> 01:33:36.886]  It's all about desecrating God.
[01:33:37.906 --> 01:33:39.067]  It's all about hurting the innocent.
[01:33:40.007 --> 01:33:43.528]  And we sit here and we ask ourselves if they're devil worshiping.
[01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:48.209]  On the Olympic.
[01:33:52.831 --> 01:33:53.651]  Opening ceremony.
[01:33:56.001 --> 01:33:57.282]  What are they doing behind the scenes?
[01:33:57.322 --> 01:34:18.553]  Well, you heard the earlier guest on, the incredible journalist from Muckraker, Anthony Rubin, telling you that they are going to release
[01:34:20.273 --> 01:34:27.739]  Footage all over the country where they go to the houses where the little babies and little kids have disappeared and the police won't come and nobody cares.
[01:34:28.119 --> 01:34:29.880]  They track where they were loaded on, where they went.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.442]  They got the documents from Whistleblower and the children are gone.
[01:34:33.843 --> 01:34:39.308]  Iconic camp horror film Hellraiser is getting a remake with trans actor that cuts men's penises off.
[01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:43.491]  That's what this is.
[01:34:43.531 --> 01:34:49.996]  This is the most hardcore Satanism externalized into the public.
[01:34:54.352 --> 01:34:58.895]  And Kamala Harris, of course, and the disgusting Pritzkers, you know it's on their laptops.
[01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:08.521]  Kamala Harris loves transgender child mutilation and other degenerate LGBTQIAAP2S plus perversion.
[01:35:09.042 --> 01:35:10.743]  And the P stands for pedophile.
[01:35:12.264 --> 01:35:15.946]  That's bad enough when kids get raped, but man, they're like, hey, let's go further.
[01:35:15.986 --> 01:35:17.648]  Let's cut their genitals off.
[01:35:17.668 --> 01:35:17.748]  Yeah.
[01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:23.992]  And let's have biological men winning the track meets.
[01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:33.898]  And that's Blackrock.
[01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:40.140]  So now they have these races where... Now look at this.
[01:35:40.841 --> 01:35:41.961]  Top three finishers.
[01:35:42.721 --> 01:35:43.621]  Biological men.
[01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:46.843]  You can look at them.
[01:35:46.883 --> 01:35:47.443]  Those are men.
[01:35:49.683 --> 01:35:50.064]  Men!
[01:35:51.664 --> 01:35:52.044]  Men!
[01:35:55.105 --> 01:35:57.146]  And they don't even chop their ding-a-lings off.
[01:35:58.541 --> 01:36:05.566]  They get up there at the Olympics, get their gold medal, you can see their schlong in their pants, and it's all a big giant joke.
[01:36:11.431 --> 01:36:21.519]  You know, Rob Agueras was saying he might go join, you know, the Olympic team and then just beat up the trans men, the men that claim they're women.
[01:36:21.539 --> 01:36:23.881]  The problem is they're going to make you beat up a bunch of girls to get to them.
[01:36:28.854 --> 01:36:34.295]  Yeah, here's a video of men choking out women and then being- I mean, look at that deviant!
[01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:35.756]  Look at that dude's face!
[01:36:36.616 --> 01:36:38.196]  Look at these- I mean, look at this rugby player!
[01:36:38.216 --> 01:36:46.158]  I mean, he's masculine by men's standards, and he's- Look at this lunatic!
[01:36:47.799 --> 01:36:52.820]  And they're winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.
[01:36:56.499 --> 01:37:02.344]  And the media praises them and talks about how stunning and brave and cool they are.
[01:37:05.246 --> 01:37:08.669]  But the bigger story isn't the mentally ill people they can get to go do this.
[01:37:09.489 --> 01:37:10.070]  The predators.
[01:37:11.611 --> 01:37:16.715]  It's that the corporations support it, and when we support the big corporations, we fund these people.
[01:37:17.115 --> 01:37:17.615]  And I get it.
[01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:19.157]  Big corporations run almost everything.
[01:37:19.217 --> 01:37:24.461]  It's hard to not be involved with them, but there's ways, and they feel the pressure.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:33.083]  You certainly don't want to invest with them and invest in companies that say, we believe in two genders, man and a woman.
[01:37:34.584 --> 01:37:35.644]  Well, you're hateful.
[01:37:35.664 --> 01:37:38.605]  You're going to make us commit suicide.
[01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:45.088]  They come and confuse teenagers, screw them up, and then they commit suicide because of the surgeries.
[01:37:45.348 --> 01:37:49.610]  They go, oh, we have the highest rate of suicide because you didn't praise them enough.
[01:37:55.313 --> 01:37:57.235]  Everybody should just boycott these events.
[01:37:57.615 --> 01:38:06.662]  You go to any event and there's a man competing, you don't support it, you make a scene, you leave.
[01:38:09.444 --> 01:38:14.728]  And you make public posts about the sponsors.
[01:38:16.069 --> 01:38:18.691]  But that's why they need total censorship to make you take a poison shot.
[01:38:20.776 --> 01:38:28.661]  To make you accept the targeting of children, to make you accept these degenerates, these predators, and the things they're doing.
[01:38:29.362 --> 01:38:33.965]  Yeah, it's one thing to show the rugby player, there's video of him running over women.
[01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:50.096]  Alright, I got a bunch of other news I want to hit, but that's who Kamala Harris is, and just shame on anybody that supports her or any of these people.
[01:38:51.872 --> 01:38:54.094]  But the mothership funding it is the central banks.
[01:38:55.375 --> 01:38:56.115]  And it's BlackRock.
[01:38:57.617 --> 01:39:04.262]  And they know... exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:09.446 --> 01:39:11.087]  All right, I've got a lot of news to cover.
[01:39:11.167 --> 01:39:15.031]  And as I said, we've got these big guests coming up next hour.
[01:39:16.592 --> 01:39:20.235]  And I've got a lot of other tidbits that I want to hit as well.
[01:39:21.946 --> 01:39:41.875]  But if you think the globalists are crazy now, and if you think you're living in an Alice in Wonderland, Hieronymus Bosch crossover, Hellraiser crossover, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:39:43.315 --> 01:39:49.258]  And Satan's spirit is a program to kill us.
[01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:53.272]  And so it seems fantastical and over-the-top because it is.
[01:39:54.313 --> 01:39:55.194]  And it's not of this world.
[01:39:55.874 --> 01:39:57.675]  The Bible tells us it's a fallen entity.
[01:39:57.695 --> 01:40:05.281]  It's an alien that doesn't want us to reach Type 1 civilization where we are not dependent on this planet anymore.
[01:40:08.043 --> 01:40:18.411]  And God made us, and God's there, and God gave us free will, but there is a really bad interdimensional life form
[01:40:19.551 --> 01:40:33.060]  That comes up with all this and tries to program us to do this, and organizes human society to carry this out, and it makes perfect sense, and I've experienced it, and I've seen it, I've been around these people, and I know how they operate, and at the top of Hollywood and all of it, it's devil worship, folks.
[01:40:34.661 --> 01:40:36.682]  But it isn't even coming from people.
[01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:38.524]  It is an outside influence.
[01:40:42.446 --> 01:40:48.110]  Now, I want to play a couple clips here.
[01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:59.305]  Of what's unfolding and what's happening around the world.
[01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:04.629]  And then we're going to get this gentleman on next hour.
[01:41:04.649 --> 01:41:05.669]  In fact, let's play that clip.
[01:41:05.729 --> 01:41:06.490]  I played it yesterday.
[01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:08.071]  Pastor Brandon Biggs.
[01:41:08.131 --> 01:41:11.654]  I think it's important to hear this clip ahead of him joining us.
[01:41:13.995 --> 01:41:16.697]  But at a certain point, I have all this amazing news to cover.
[01:41:18.218 --> 01:41:19.259]  And I'll be honest with you.
[01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:23.972]  At some point, it's not that I'm even overwhelmed by it.
[01:41:24.973 --> 01:41:28.856]  It's that, why am I even covering little pieces of this or little pieces of that?
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.662]  When it really just does get down to good versus evil.
[01:41:36.642 --> 01:41:38.164]  And the fact that this is a spiritual war.
[01:41:40.305 --> 01:41:44.569]  And the fact that it's almost like, it's not almost like it is, but I don't know how we do this.
[01:41:46.564 --> 01:41:49.865]  We don't even argue with the things they throw at us and all the lies.
[01:41:49.885 --> 01:41:56.146]  I mean, that's just to distract us and keep us engaged with dealing with their distractions.
[01:41:56.647 --> 01:41:58.367]  We just have to fully reject them.
[01:41:58.407 --> 01:42:07.489]  I mean, I've used this analogy before, but let's say you live in a town, a new restaurant opens up, and the first time you go there, you and your family get food poisoning.
[01:42:08.130 --> 01:42:09.310]  You probably never go there again.
[01:42:11.035 --> 01:42:14.016]  But let's say you try it again a year later, and you all get sick again.
[01:42:14.756 --> 01:42:16.616]  Well, that restaurant's not going to stay open, folks.
[01:42:17.737 --> 01:42:22.438]  But in government and corporations, they control the central bank's issuance of currency.
[01:42:24.918 --> 01:42:29.440]  And so even though they're unpopular and rejected, they get to still stay in control.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:39.262]  So I liken this to a restaurant being packed with people, and super popular, and the food tastes horrible, it's got cockroach.
[01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:41.109]  We're good to go.
[01:43:05.933 --> 01:43:16.019]  But imagine a restaurant that's got cars wrapped around the block, and lines out the door, and you get food poisoning every time you go there.
[01:43:18.561 --> 01:43:21.622]  No, people stop going there really quick, the word gets out and shuts down.
[01:43:22.103 --> 01:43:23.904]  But that's in the real world, the real free market.
[01:43:30.956 --> 01:43:32.238]  And so that's what the New World Order is.
[01:43:32.599 --> 01:43:33.820]  Everything it does is poison.
[01:43:34.221 --> 01:43:35.803]  Everything it does makes you sick or kills you.
[01:43:36.144 --> 01:43:37.105]  Everything it does is a lie.
[01:43:37.125 --> 01:43:39.849]  And we just have to get to the point where we don't listen to anything you say.
[01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:41.151]  We're not engaging you.
[01:43:41.372 --> 01:43:42.413]  We don't care what you say.
[01:43:42.694 --> 01:43:43.675]  We don't talk to you.
[01:43:43.935 --> 01:43:44.657]  We're done with you.
[01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:49.512]  And we're at the point where we can still turn this around.
[01:43:49.872 --> 01:43:55.614]  But they get their social credit score in, and their ESG program in, and their global vaccine passport in.
[01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:56.914]  That's the foot in the door.
[01:43:57.454 --> 01:44:01.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you think it's bad now, you have not seen anything yet.
[01:44:05.617 --> 01:44:09.538]  You've got all these followers that want the corporate media's approval, and the school's approval.
[01:44:09.818 --> 01:44:14.520]  So they'll say, hey, the school wants to have my son's dick cut off, or my daughter's breast cut off.
[01:44:16.357 --> 01:44:16.937]  Let's do it!
[01:44:17.377 --> 01:44:22.299]  And they pat you on the head and talk about how special you are and all because they do that, you're now part of the system.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.701]  And maybe the New York Times writes an article about you.
[01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:29.842]  And then you're part of the good club.
[01:44:34.284 --> 01:44:34.864]  It's spiritual.
[01:44:35.851 --> 01:44:37.813]  They do it to prove themselves to Satan.
[01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:40.155]  Even though they're not conscious of it, most of them are now.
[01:44:40.795 --> 01:44:41.836]  They get a thrill.
[01:44:42.196 --> 01:44:44.518]  These parents get a thrill out of hurting their kids.
[01:44:44.819 --> 01:44:45.419]  It's legal.
[01:44:45.499 --> 01:44:46.700]  Munchausen by proxy.
[01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:54.467]  Here's a clip of the pastor coming up next hour.
[01:44:55.794 --> 01:44:59.955]  And I saw Trump rising up, and then I saw an attempt on his life.
[01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:07.896]  This bullet flew by his ear, and it came so close to his head that it busted his eardrum.
[01:45:08.497 --> 01:45:14.718]  And I saw, he fell to his knees during this time frame, and he started worshiping the Lord.
[01:45:14.758 --> 01:45:17.878]  He got radically born again during this time frame.
[01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:25.260]  I'm talking, people say he's saved now, but he becomes really on fire for Jesus for what I saw coming.
[01:45:28.154 --> 01:45:30.596]  Brandon Biggs joining us next hour.
[01:45:33.258 --> 01:45:34.719]  Here's some of the other news headlines.
[01:45:35.619 --> 01:45:36.480]  Can't make this up.
[01:45:38.321 --> 01:45:39.582]  XMI6 boss.
[01:45:40.142 --> 01:45:42.244]  That literally runs the transgender program worldwide.
[01:45:43.305 --> 01:45:50.149]  Russian disinformation from UK riots over murder of three young girls.
[01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:55.093]  So, a young 17-year-old illegal alien
[01:45:57.279 --> 01:46:01.521]  Stabs three kids to death because they're white.
[01:46:03.502 --> 01:46:05.423]  And people demonstrate and get angry about it.
[01:46:05.463 --> 01:46:06.884]  The police attack them so they fight back.
[01:46:08.025 --> 01:46:14.268]  And MI6 says Russian disinformation caused the people to be angry.
[01:46:15.309 --> 01:46:16.109]  That's right, folks.
[01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:19.331]  If you forget to take
[01:46:22.025 --> 01:46:23.526]  Hamburgers off the grill and they burn?
[01:46:23.786 --> 01:46:24.186]  Russians.
[01:46:24.326 --> 01:46:25.387]  If you fall on a banana peel?
[01:46:25.747 --> 01:46:26.207]  Russians.
[01:46:27.088 --> 01:46:28.429]  If your kid gets run over by a car?
[01:46:28.649 --> 01:46:29.069]  Russians.
[01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:30.610]  If you get cancer?
[01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:31.270]  Russians.
[01:46:32.131 --> 01:46:32.931]  If you're late to work?
[01:46:33.092 --> 01:46:33.552]  Russians.
[01:46:34.052 --> 01:46:35.053]  Forgot to do your homework?
[01:46:35.393 --> 01:46:36.554]  You don't say the dog ate it?
[01:46:37.114 --> 01:46:37.594]  Russians!
[01:46:39.115 --> 01:46:41.897]  Russians, Russians, Russians, Russians.
[01:46:42.337 --> 01:46:46.800]  And if you like President Trump and don't like pedophiles or men and women's sports?
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:47.600]  Russians.
[01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:48.961]  They say that.
[01:46:50.856 --> 01:46:51.616]  And in a way, it's true.
[01:46:51.636 --> 01:46:54.137]  I mean, the Russians are rejecting cutting their son's penises off.
[01:46:54.177 --> 01:46:55.117]  That's illegal in Russia.
[01:46:55.137 --> 01:46:58.318]  Because they're bad people.
[01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:02.359]  They don't give their boys the gift of having their genitals cut off.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:05.420]  Those damn Russians.
[01:47:05.761 --> 01:47:06.681]  At it again, folks.
[01:47:06.701 --> 01:47:07.601]  It's just so bad.
[01:47:08.521 --> 01:47:11.842]  Biden to expand nuclear weapon arsenal in Europe.
[01:47:13.103 --> 01:47:15.383]  Russia to reciprocate.
[01:47:16.704 --> 01:47:20.445]  And now moves their nukes to the border and submarines off our coast.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:27.644]  Third child dies after stabbing Rampage at a dance class in England.
[01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:31.086]  Yeah, pull up the young monster that did it.
[01:47:31.126 --> 01:47:36.830]  I posted it on X. Absolutely disgusting.
[01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:40.693]  Surprised I didn't say he identifies as a woman.
[01:47:42.354 --> 01:47:45.556]  You know, usually they do and, you know, somebody's running around killing people.
[01:47:49.178 --> 01:47:49.921]  We're going to get a break.
[01:47:49.941 --> 01:47:52.430]  We're going to come back with our special guest.
[01:47:54.052 --> 01:47:56.533]  Again, please remember, I can't do this show without you.
[01:47:56.573 --> 01:47:58.534]  I can't do it without your support, your word of mouth, your prayer.

[01:48:31.089 --> 01:48:32.891]  That's drjonesnaturals.com.

[01:48:38.566 --> 01:48:39.667]  Shroom Force is great.
[01:48:39.707 --> 01:48:40.347]  It's selling out.

[01:48:58.853 --> 01:49:00.594]  And again, if you go to infowarestore.com,
[01:49:02.128 --> 01:49:03.869]  We got a big sale going that's going to end soon.

[01:49:19.275 --> 01:49:22.236]  And be sure and get our Info Wars fundraising shirt.
[01:49:22.897 --> 01:49:26.098]  That's the iconic image of Trump saying, fight, fight, fight, with bulletproof under it.
[01:49:26.558 --> 01:49:27.999]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[01:49:28.019 --> 01:49:28.759]  You don't want to miss this.
[01:49:29.239 --> 01:49:30.200]  Take a look at what happened.
[01:49:36.354 --> 01:49:43.558]  On July 13th, 2024, the Deep State took a shot, not just at Donald Trump, but at America and our Republic.
[01:49:43.698 --> 01:49:49.001]  But by the grace of God, God's hand was on Donald Trump, and by just millimeters, he survived.
[01:49:49.261 --> 01:49:55.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Deep State, Google, all the big tech companies, other than X, have been trying to suppress this image.
[01:49:55.685 --> 01:49:58.366]  They've been trying to suppress everything about the assassination.
[01:49:58.786 --> 01:50:00.007]  But it is so important
[01:50:00.307 --> 01:50:00.527]  Thank you.
[01:50:20.894 --> 01:50:28.479]  Patriot Apparel makers in America and they partnered with us and they print the shirts and everything right there in Arkansas.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:31.341]  So these are ready to ship right now.
[01:50:32.923 --> 01:50:34.043]  We love you!
[01:50:34.083 --> 01:50:34.364]  Yes!
[01:50:41.562 --> 01:50:47.824]  President Trump had eight shots fired at him, killing one man, critically wounding two others, and grazing his ear.
[01:50:48.444 --> 01:50:57.227]  He immediately popped back up and said, fight, fight, fight, which translates to never surrender, never back down, never give up.
[01:50:57.607 --> 01:51:03.769]  But it takes the exercise of free speech and the financial support in a fight to save our republic.
[01:51:03.829 --> 01:51:05.089]  Infowars is recognized
[01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.949]  That's right.
[01:51:22.745 --> 01:51:27.828]  And wear it proudly in public and you'll probably get, it's what I've experienced, 95% love.
[01:51:28.128 --> 01:51:30.249]  You may have some leftists try to physically attack you as well.
[01:51:30.309 --> 01:51:33.491]  But it's an adventure to wear this shirt.
[01:51:33.511 --> 01:51:35.692]  I've been wearing it out in public and it's been amazing.
[01:51:35.732 --> 01:51:43.896]  And you really see the grassroots support that President Trump has around the country, not just in red cities, red towns, and red states.
[01:51:44.277 --> 01:51:50.340]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a critical juncture for the Republic and now is the time to wear our colors loud and proud.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.661]  The red, white, and blue.
[01:51:52.381 --> 01:51:55.443]  With President Trump raising his fists defiantly to the New World Order.
[01:51:55.763 --> 01:52:00.186]  Go to HoldTheLine.com and use promo code Alex and you get an additional 10% off.
[01:52:00.526 --> 01:52:11.033]  By wearing this shirt in public, you raise your fists in defiance with President Trump and myself and many others of the globalist tyranny and say, we will never surrender the New World Order.
[01:52:11.494 --> 01:52:14.055]  And the answer to your tyranny is 1776.
[01:52:15.176 --> 01:52:16.277]  We will never surrender.
[01:52:16.477 --> 01:52:18.138]  We will fight, fight, fight!
[01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.299]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:52:29.468 --> 01:52:32.351]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[01:52:32.391 --> 01:52:40.680]  resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:52:41.121 --> 01:52:43.603]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:52:43.643 --> 01:52:45.085]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:52:45.405 --> 01:52:47.307]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:52:47.547 --> 01:52:49.689]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:52:49.930 --> 01:52:51.011]  This is all confirmed.
[01:52:51.031 --> 01:52:51.972]  This is not a drill.
[01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:56.036]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:52:56.396 --> 01:52:57.817]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:52:57.937 --> 01:52:58.418]  Apple 100%.
[01:52:58.818 --> 01:53:04.424]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:53:04.884 --> 01:53:09.627]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:53:09.947 --> 01:53:10.808]  This is happening.
[01:53:10.848 --> 01:53:18.773]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:53:18.853 --> 01:53:24.817]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:53:25.237 --> 01:53:33.183]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:53:34.043 --> 01:53:37.604]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:53:37.664 --> 01:53:41.085]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:53:41.325 --> 01:53:48.407]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:53:48.647 --> 01:53:51.307]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:53:51.667 --> 01:53:56.428]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:53:56.889 --> 01:53:58.469]  It is the virtual reality AI
[01:53:58.729 --> 01:54:05.337]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:54:19.168 --> 01:54:27.894]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:54:27.914 --> 01:54:32.777]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:54:33.177 --> 01:54:36.279]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[01:54:36.299 --> 01:54:38.100]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:46.085]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:54:46.605 --> 01:54:53.352]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction!
[01:54:53.792 --> 01:54:59.137]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you!
[01:54:59.377 --> 01:55:03.942]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm!
[01:55:03.962 --> 01:55:06.204]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:55:06.324 --> 01:55:07.265]  Now break free!
[01:55:10.994 --> 01:55:19.705]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:55:20.506 --> 01:55:21.467]  Thomas Jefferson
[01:55:22.868 --> 01:55:27.011]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:55:27.191 --> 01:55:29.672]  Literally, they're bringing in the foreign army.
[01:55:30.053 --> 01:55:31.874]  But it won't happen overnight with you in blue helmets.
[01:55:31.954 --> 01:55:33.115]  It's just they're now your police.
[01:55:33.655 --> 01:55:34.896]  They've already purged the military.
[01:55:35.256 --> 01:55:35.976]  They bring them in.
[01:55:36.057 --> 01:55:37.017]  They'll follow orders.
[01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:38.478]  This is very simple.
[01:55:38.758 --> 01:55:42.621]  So Rome took 400 years of bringing in foreign troops to fall.
[01:55:43.101 --> 01:55:44.142]  They didn't do it on purpose.
[01:55:44.602 --> 01:55:46.483]  But the globalists look at 1984 as fiction.
[01:55:47.984 --> 01:55:53.147]  Or they look at Rome and they go, which was historical, and they go, that is a blueprint.
[01:55:53.607 --> 01:55:54.788]  That is an owner's manual.
[01:55:55.289 --> 01:55:56.529]  That is a battle plan.
[01:55:56.970 --> 01:55:58.390]  So that's what the Great Reset is.
[01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:07.456]  It's accelerating the collapse of Western civilization, as you don't want in around to compete with the globalist model of eat the bugs and enslavement and collapse.
[01:56:07.876 --> 01:56:12.779]  So they're actively seeing prosperity and Christian nationals freedom.
[01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:15.401]  God forbid the rest of the world pick up
[01:56:16.081 --> 01:56:16.922]  Western culture.
[01:56:17.202 --> 01:56:18.503]  So you brand it as racist.
[01:56:18.523 --> 01:56:25.087]  You say it's bad because it's like kryptonite, you know, to Superman or holy water and high noon to a vampire.
[01:56:25.568 --> 01:56:30.051]  If people say, I want my second amendment, I want my new process, I want my capitalism.
[01:56:30.431 --> 01:56:33.713]  Well, then it's over for the black rocks and the Googles, the Facebook.
[01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:38.897]  So that's why they're fundamentally branding freedom as a white evil thing.
[01:56:39.477 --> 01:56:45.802]  Because let's face it, Western civilization did develop from Greece on this incredible thing that could uplift humanity.
[01:56:46.082 --> 01:56:58.691]  So you discredit it by making it racial instead of selling it to the world and having everyone adopt it and creating unification, not through centralization or enslavement, but through adoption because it works so well.
[01:56:59.172 --> 01:57:02.314]  And so the globalist tyrants are fundamentally threatened
[01:57:02.654 --> 01:57:04.856]  By Western Christian civilization.
[01:57:05.116 --> 01:57:06.237]  And that's why they're at war with it.
[01:57:06.478 --> 01:57:07.779]  Which is why we should embrace it.
[01:57:08.019 --> 01:57:14.045]  And that's why the great numbers of double the blacks voting for Trump, or triple the Hispanics we just saw 10 years ago.
[01:57:14.445 --> 01:57:24.895]  And that's why they're in full panic mode trying to bring in totally uninformed foreigners from all over who they control and who they can run through NGOs hoping that they'll be the savior.
[01:57:24.935 --> 01:57:28.318]  So as negative as all this is, I see this as the
[01:57:28.718 --> 01:57:32.045]  All right, in November of last year, they taped this interview.
[01:57:32.085 --> 01:57:34.830]  They released it in March of this year.
[01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:38.336]  On record, Pastor Brandon Biggs.
[01:57:39.537 --> 01:57:45.000]  He joins us also with his other pastor, Steve Coccolante.
[01:57:46.001 --> 01:57:52.625]  And you can find all their work at discoverchurch.online and also on Last Days 247.
[01:57:52.845 --> 01:57:55.206]  That's where you find Brandon Beggs.
[01:57:55.827 --> 01:58:02.311]  But, you know, we make a lot of really interesting and amazing informative predictions here.
[01:58:03.471 --> 01:58:10.299]  But I gotta tell you, the power of the Holy Spirit is all-powerful, and so I wanted to play the clip of Pastor Brandon Beggs.
[01:58:10.319 --> 01:58:11.240]  They released in March.
[01:58:11.941 --> 01:58:16.066]  They taped this in November of 2023, and it's on record.
[01:58:16.086 --> 01:58:16.827]  It's out there.
[01:58:16.847 --> 01:58:18.088]  You'll look at it on YouTube, Instagram,
[01:58:18.268 --> 01:58:18.989]  We're good.
[01:58:33.951 --> 01:58:34.391]  We're good to go.
[01:58:53.029 --> 01:58:56.970]  I saw Trump rising up, and then I saw an attempt on his life.
[01:58:58.231 --> 01:59:04.733]  This bullet flew by his ear, and it came so close to his head that it busted his eardrum.
[01:59:05.334 --> 01:59:11.576]  And I saw, he fell to his knees during this time frame, and he started worshiping the Lord.
[01:59:11.596 --> 01:59:14.717]  He got radically born again during this time frame.
[01:59:15.017 --> 01:59:22.100]  I'm talking, people say he's saved now, but he becomes really on fire for Jesus for what I saw coming.
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:30.087]  And then you see the photo of Trump on his knees with bloody hands and bloody face, and he said that he saw that it was God.
[01:59:30.107 --> 01:59:34.370]  He said that the RNC in other speeches, in that moment, that it was God that had protected him.
[01:59:34.410 --> 01:59:40.416]  And he looked out and saw the crowd thinking he was dead and pushed past the Secret Service and demanded he stand up.
[01:59:41.297 --> 01:59:43.679]  And he said, wait a minute, fight, fight, fight.
[01:59:44.399 --> 01:59:45.921]  So an incredible moment.
[01:59:46.581 --> 01:59:47.762]  Pastor Brandon Biggs,
[01:59:48.908 --> 01:59:51.369]  Last Days on YouTube, Last Days 247.
[01:59:52.230 --> 01:59:57.332]  And Pastor Steve also joins us, Pastor Steve Coccolati.
[01:59:57.992 --> 02:00:03.035]  So gentlemen of discoverchurch.online and Discover Ministries on YouTube.
[02:00:03.795 --> 02:00:05.796]  Wow, great to have you both on.
[02:00:05.816 --> 02:00:07.657]  I know you've got more prophetic
[02:00:08.490 --> 02:00:15.934]  Word for people, obviously inspired by God, you can't make a call like this and it not be, I mean, not just the grazing the ear, but the falling down.
[02:00:15.954 --> 02:00:19.795]  And then Trump said, and I talked to Trump's people, he didn't even know about your clip.
[02:00:19.815 --> 02:00:22.937]  He literally said days later, I felt God at that moment.
[02:00:22.977 --> 02:00:32.361]  And everybody that knows Trump said he's credited God publicly, but that Trump is a new man now, even more focused, more in that place of the most high, that quiet place of the most high.
[02:00:35.356 --> 02:00:39.223]  Pastor Brandon, you know, Pastor Steve, you can start wherever you want here, gentlemen.
[02:00:39.283 --> 02:00:41.767]  I know you've got more prophetic words for us, so God bless you.
[02:00:44.231 --> 02:00:44.772]  Go ahead, Pastor.
[02:00:46.769 --> 02:00:49.431]  Well, I want to say thank you for having us on, Alex.
[02:00:50.072 --> 02:01:00.980]  We were watching you in Australia just to let you know and praying for you all these years, because when you got deplatformed in 2018, you were the canary in the coal mine for the rest of us, and we knew they were coming after us.
[02:01:01.701 --> 02:01:05.443]  And we were predicting, at that time, I predicted Trump was going to be president.
[02:01:05.724 --> 02:01:08.606]  I was the second person after the prophet Kim Clement.
[02:01:09.475 --> 02:01:14.758]  And I predicted not only just him winning, but what is the plan that he would be an agent of justice.
[02:01:15.558 --> 02:01:18.420]  And he didn't quite fulfill it in the first administration.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:26.023]  And so there's been this thwarting, this lawfare against him because he's connected to this issue of biblical justice in the end times.
[02:01:27.304 --> 02:01:28.365]  Then Brandon came on.
[02:01:29.633 --> 02:01:39.737]  You know, our YouTube channel, and he's got a great YouTube channel that's exploding now, and we just featured him talking about what's going to happen to President Trump before he gets re-elected.
[02:01:39.797 --> 02:01:48.160]  We prophesy, we believe he's going to get re-elected a second time for a very specific purpose, but I think Brandon should be the one that tell the vision.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:55.783]  I agree, but I'm not pastors like you, but I have done a lot of Bible study in the final fall, but there's a lot of different, you know, sections the way the gifts are described.
[02:01:55.803 --> 02:01:58.804]  Explain what the gift of prophecy is for folks that don't understand.
[02:02:00.652 --> 02:02:01.493]  Okay, I can do that.
[02:02:01.533 --> 02:02:07.797]  That's in 1 Corinthians 14, so the gift of prophecy is not just fortune-telling and telling people their future.
[02:02:08.057 --> 02:02:09.698]  That's a huge misunderstanding.
[02:02:11.139 --> 02:02:18.805]  The purpose of the prophet is to speak for God, and we speak for God without studying an encyclopedia and preparing notes.
[02:02:18.825 --> 02:02:22.648]  We're speaking by inspiration, so that act of inspiration is called prophecy.
[02:02:23.168 --> 02:02:25.951]  1 Corinthians 14 verse 3 says, So there's no necessarily futuristic element in it, but you're speaking for God.
[02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:27.772]  But what do the prophets speak about the most?
[02:02:38.422 --> 02:02:39.903]  You study it, which I have.
[02:02:40.484 --> 02:02:47.270]  The main topic, the main mandate of the prophet out of the five-fold ministry is to bring justice to the leaders and to the nations.
[02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:56.698]  And because of that, then there is an inherent futuristic element because you're telling America and you're telling President Trump and the deep state, this is what God wants.
[02:02:56.918 --> 02:02:58.420]  He's giving you time to do it.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:03.661]  Or else repent if you're actually fighting God, and if you don't do it, here's what will happen.
[02:03:03.701 --> 02:03:08.983]  And here are the signs that He will give, like the Great American Solar Eclipse, three of them, since 2017.
[02:03:09.903 --> 02:03:14.084]  I don't know if the audience knows that, but God will give signs.
[02:03:14.364 --> 02:03:17.005]  God will speak to people who don't even read the Bible, and He brings
[02:03:17.005 --> 02:03:29.953]  Well if you go back to Jonah, to going to Nineveh, and if you go to Ezekiel, when it burns in his bones, when I personally know it's God, I feel like electrified, it's like an epiphany, and I know this isn't me, this is information that people need to know.
[02:03:30.073 --> 02:03:32.635]  So absolutely, it's something being pushed into you.
[02:03:33.902 --> 02:03:34.202]  That's right.
[02:03:34.482 --> 02:03:40.425]  And so Jonah is a great example, because what people don't realize is it's not just Jonah walking in, but prior to that, there was a plague.
[02:03:40.565 --> 02:03:41.406]  So it's just like COVID.
[02:03:41.986 --> 02:03:45.928]  After that, there was an earthquake and a solar eclipse.
[02:03:46.308 --> 02:03:47.769]  So we're following the pattern.
[02:03:47.829 --> 02:03:52.031]  Patterns are prophetic, and the Bible history is really our prophecy.
[02:03:52.151 --> 02:03:53.531]  Bible history is our prophecy.
[02:03:53.992 --> 02:03:57.373]  So we've had the pandemic, whatever you want to call it.
[02:03:57.913 --> 02:03:59.874]  That's the start of the redemption process.
[02:04:00.074 --> 02:04:01.695]  It's the start of the Exodus, for instance.
[02:04:01.975 --> 02:04:02.996]  The 10 plagues start.
[02:04:03.716 --> 02:04:06.417]  The exodus out of slavery starts with the plague.
[02:04:06.818 --> 02:04:08.898]  So something was triggered with the COVID pandemic.
[02:04:09.619 --> 02:04:10.139]  It's global.
[02:04:10.219 --> 02:04:12.060]  It's the first global event since Noah's Flood.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.861]  It's even more global than World War II.
[02:04:14.881 --> 02:04:17.642]  There were nations that were not involved in World War II, not affected really.
[02:04:18.063 --> 02:04:19.523]  But COVID impacted everybody.
[02:04:19.543 --> 02:04:21.964]  So we're now in the prophetic countdown.
[02:04:22.164 --> 02:04:23.825]  That's what God is telling us.
[02:04:23.905 --> 02:04:26.126]  And we should have the fear of God, like Alex, you said.
[02:04:26.506 --> 02:04:27.567]  We should have the fear of God.
[02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:30.188]  God is coming to right the wrongs.
[02:04:30.588 --> 02:04:31.908]  He's coming to clean house.
[02:04:32.368 --> 02:04:35.789]  You see the pastors that are immoral and not living pure lives.
[02:04:35.809 --> 02:04:37.110]  You see they're getting cleaned up.
[02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:41.331]  Story after story coming out of particularly your state, Alex, in Texas.
[02:04:41.831 --> 02:04:43.071]  God is here to clean house.
[02:04:43.511 --> 02:04:46.372]  But the good news for that is they've been coming after Trump.
[02:04:46.672 --> 02:04:48.593]  They've been coming after Alex Jones.
[02:04:49.033 --> 02:04:50.974]  And God is going to go on the offensive.
[02:04:51.454 --> 02:04:55.495]  God is going to bring justice to bear such that people cannot deny.
[02:04:56.135 --> 02:05:04.264]  And this grazing of the ear is one of those examples where we had comments on that video where people said, I thought I was an atheist, but now I'm not sure.
[02:05:04.804 --> 02:05:08.528]  I thought there was no evidence for God, but now I'm doubting myself.
[02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:14.354]  That's exactly the fear of God that should come when we hear prophecy or when we see prophecy fulfilled.
[02:05:14.995 --> 02:05:16.316]  It's absolutely supernatural.
[02:05:16.856 --> 02:05:19.137]  So God is getting people's attention for what?
[02:05:19.498 --> 02:05:25.221]  Not to sensationalize this, but to confirm that it's time to seek Him and to seek justice.
[02:05:25.281 --> 02:05:26.061]  This is the season.
[02:05:26.101 --> 02:05:27.962]  This is the message of these prophecies.
[02:05:29.903 --> 02:05:31.604]  All right, going to Pastor Brandon Biggs.
[02:05:32.045 --> 02:05:39.549]  Pastor, tell us about yourself and this amazing prophecy, and then what God's telling you now, what you're seeing.
[02:05:40.652 --> 02:05:43.713]  You know, Ryan, you know, I'm just gonna say it like this.
[02:05:44.133 --> 02:05:47.014]  I have so much on my heart to even talk to y'all about today.
[02:05:47.194 --> 02:06:08.602]  You know, we're in a very serious time, and I want to, you know, I try not to be real, like, a fear monger, and, you know, and tell everybody, hey, y'all need to buckle up, because things are gonna get rough, but more than ever... Oh, the Holy Spirit is on my heart.
[02:06:09.431 --> 02:06:17.261]  Yes, that's right.
[02:06:17.782 --> 02:06:27.715]  And what I've seen coming in the near future, you know, for the things that I've been praying over, and even whenever I was praying, I said, Lord, what do you want me to say to Alex Jones today?
[02:06:28.095 --> 02:06:33.097]  Because, I mean, I said, you know, we could talk about the Trump thing and the things that I've seen coming for even him.
[02:06:33.157 --> 02:06:34.918]  I've seen more attempts on his life coming.
[02:06:35.338 --> 02:06:36.719]  And the Lord said, we need to pray for him.
[02:06:36.779 --> 02:06:37.540]  This is not over.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:39.460]  These people are relentless.
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:40.501]  They're not going to give up.
[02:06:41.241 --> 02:06:48.585]  And we've got to keep praying over him and interceding that God would have a divine protection just like he did before.
[02:06:49.325 --> 02:06:49.846]  We're good.
[02:07:10.043 --> 02:07:23.649]  Three major terrorists come across the border in Arizona recently and the Lord spoke to me and he said, Brandon, I want you to warn my people that there's three major generals is what I want to call them.
[02:07:24.009 --> 02:07:28.551]  They came across the border and he said they're planning a massive attack on the Americans.
[02:07:30.051 --> 02:07:30.812]  On the soil here.
[02:07:31.092 --> 02:07:32.852]  And he warned me about this.
[02:07:32.912 --> 02:07:34.773]  I saw he had a big beard.
[02:07:35.393 --> 02:07:36.534]  He was a heavyset man.
[02:07:36.754 --> 02:07:39.035]  I saw these other two men that were standing beside him.
[02:07:39.075 --> 02:07:40.155]  They were skinnier looking.
[02:07:40.735 --> 02:07:44.877]  And he said, they're planning massive attacks.
[02:07:45.037 --> 02:07:51.419]  And I saw these cells of people that were here coming from across the border.
[02:07:51.879 --> 02:07:54.880]  They've been here for a long time and they're waiting on their orders.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:03.727]  And the Lord showed me these people all in these, like, when they are in some kind of command, they have some way of communicating.
[02:08:04.428 --> 02:08:08.071]  And whenever they are told to do, they're going to strike, strike, strike.
[02:08:08.111 --> 02:08:11.114]  And I saw them like ants coming up out of the ground.
[02:08:11.694 --> 02:08:13.236]  And the Lord said, they're underground.
[02:08:13.356 --> 02:08:15.618]  He was telling me, it's just like a type of shadow.
[02:08:15.638 --> 02:08:20.242]  What he was showing me is that they're coming up, they're going to come up out of the ground, out of their hiding places.
[02:08:20.262 --> 02:08:21.663]  Which means suddenly, suddenly.
[02:08:22.625 --> 02:08:23.366]  Yes, suddenly.
[02:08:23.606 --> 02:08:29.290]  And he said, when this happens, it will happen so many times that it will overwhelm the American people.
[02:08:30.831 --> 02:08:31.191]  Pray.
[02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:34.473]  And then I saw two major buildings in New York again.
[02:08:34.793 --> 02:08:38.516]  They look like hotels, like Trump Tower-like things.
[02:08:39.196 --> 02:08:48.343]  I can't exactly know if it was in New York or Chicago, but I know that these two buildings had bombs on the inside of them, and they exploded.
[02:08:48.363 --> 02:08:51.064]  And I could see them coming down, and they were bringing them down.
[02:08:52.646 --> 02:09:00.877]  The Lord warns me about this, but the major thing that the Lord has been talking to me about to warn the people is they're designing a new plague.
[02:09:01.498 --> 02:09:09.348]  And he said, Brennan, I need you to tell my people that there is a massive plague that will make COVID look like a walk in the park.
[02:09:09.989 --> 02:09:13.752]  He said, Brandon, they are they are using AI technology.
[02:09:14.233 --> 02:09:20.218]  And I saw them taking the DNA code of this virus that they're making in a lab.
[02:09:20.618 --> 02:09:22.039]  I saw these leaders.
[02:09:22.299 --> 02:09:23.360]  I saw these people.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:25.402]  I don't from my life.
[02:09:25.522 --> 02:09:27.884]  I probably shouldn't name their names, but I saw these.
[02:09:29.045 --> 02:09:31.065]  You're talking about a binary weapon, to be clear.
[02:09:31.085 --> 02:09:36.126]  You're saying it was designed to hit people that were already on certain medications?
[02:09:56.727 --> 02:09:57.027]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:57.567 --> 02:10:02.690]  And he said it was genetic code, the way they were doing it with DNA.
[02:10:02.730 --> 02:10:07.952]  And he said they were using that kind of technology somehow and making it into a super virus.
[02:10:08.412 --> 02:10:12.134]  And he said, Brandon, there will be no vaccination that they will be able to come up with this.
[02:10:12.174 --> 02:10:15.255]  This is made to have like a genocide against the people.
[02:10:15.555 --> 02:10:18.036]  And he told me, he said, you must warn them that they're going to do this.
[02:10:18.316 --> 02:10:21.738]  And you know, whenever you warned everybody, Alex, that they were going to try to
[02:10:22.838 --> 02:10:26.161]  Bring in another kind of a COVID before the election.
[02:10:26.582 --> 02:10:30.686]  You sound the alarm to warn the people, and it looks like it was stopped.
[02:10:31.086 --> 02:10:36.771]  The louder we get, we expose their darkness and their plans of what they're trying to plot against the people.
[02:10:36.791 --> 02:10:37.171]  And isn't that key?
[02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:41.415]  You're the pastor, but isn't God gives us prophecy to give us a chance to stop it?
[02:10:41.455 --> 02:10:42.917]  It's not meaning we want it to happen.
[02:10:42.937 --> 02:10:48.562]  It means people, and then God gives people the power of prophecy so they get listened to later, and we can turn it around.
[02:10:49.437 --> 02:10:50.718]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[02:10:50.958 --> 02:10:54.120]  And I believe with all my heart that we can stop these things that I'm seeing.
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:11:10.308]  You know, when we sound the alarm and we're saying, hey, look over here, look over here, like a watchman, you know, it's like what they would do in the old days, you know, they would stand on the wall and they would see the enemies coming and they would say, listen, there's an army coming to destroy Israel.
[02:11:10.328 --> 02:11:11.649]  There's an army coming to do whatever.
[02:11:12.269 --> 02:11:15.011]  They're warning the people so they can prepare to fight.
[02:11:15.571 --> 02:11:22.956]  And here I am, I'm trying to warn you all that they're going to try to create another major virus like COVID that is worse.
[02:11:23.677 --> 02:11:24.818]  COVID was the test run.
[02:11:25.178 --> 02:11:27.359]  You all think that COVID was the major event?
[02:11:27.559 --> 02:11:27.780]  No.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.303]  I've seen hundreds of millions of people going to die from this virus.
[02:11:32.663 --> 02:11:36.345]  And I saw it was a great, like a yellow cloud.
[02:11:36.365 --> 02:11:37.146]  It was like a
[02:11:37.586 --> 02:11:41.549]  A plague like coming out of, it was airborne is what the Lord was trying to show me.
[02:11:42.190 --> 02:11:46.813]  And there was literally camps of people.
[02:11:46.833 --> 02:11:49.175]  The hospitals were overwhelmed.
[02:11:49.535 --> 02:11:53.178]  They were overwhelmed with all the people that were dying from this virus.
[02:11:53.258 --> 02:11:55.440]  And they had tents.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:12:00.464]  The Lord showed me tents of people all throughout the parking lots of places.
[02:12:02.365 --> 02:12:03.326]  We're good to go.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.401]  I can tell you're real.
[02:12:22.182 --> 02:12:27.025]  I can feel it in the spirit that you guys are on target, and I've seen some of the things you've said, they've come true as well.
[02:12:27.446 --> 02:12:35.872]  And I've had similar things happen, and I never really wanted to even say it on air, but I know when it's God telling me something, and in just the last six months, I said they will try to kill Trump.
[02:12:35.892 --> 02:12:36.312]  It's imminent.
[02:12:36.752 --> 02:12:40.775]  Because I could literally feel God almost slapping me on the side of the face saying,
[02:12:41.556 --> 02:12:47.418]  I'm telling you this, but I had some really amazing things happen in the last six months, and I told people on air about it no matter how crazy it sounded.
[02:12:47.438 --> 02:12:50.459]  Notice, the media didn't attack me because they know this stuff's real, folks.
[02:12:50.479 --> 02:12:51.419]  They don't want to even talk about it.
[02:12:52.039 --> 02:12:55.100]  And I would just, like, wake up, and God would say, this happened four times in one week.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:58.681]  This has happened other times in my life, but not, you know, usually, like, a couple times a year.
[02:12:58.761 --> 02:13:01.142]  And God would say, your phone's in there on the bathroom.
[02:13:01.202 --> 02:13:01.642]  Go look at it.
[02:13:01.662 --> 02:13:01.822]  It's 4 a.m.
[02:13:03.422 --> 02:13:06.986]  I'm doing this because you need to absolutely do what I say when I say it and say what I tell you to say.
[02:13:20.481 --> 02:13:24.744]  And so that's why since then, I've just said whatever I'm, because we're in that much danger.
[02:13:25.144 --> 02:13:25.904]  This is that real.
[02:13:25.964 --> 02:13:27.345]  God is real, folks, okay?
[02:13:27.365 --> 02:13:27.985]  This isn't me.
[02:13:28.426 --> 02:13:30.787]  It's that I'm attuned to it, and there's many other people.
[02:13:31.187 --> 02:13:34.229]  And as the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[02:13:34.509 --> 02:13:38.271]  And I'm not claiming I'm some angel or perfect person, but I love God, and I've been touched by God.
[02:13:38.632 --> 02:13:40.693]  And I can tell you right now that Pastor Brandon Biggs has.
[02:13:40.953 --> 02:13:44.455]  So I want you to get back into this bio attack you see happening, and we'll get into it next segment.
[02:13:44.735 --> 02:13:48.958]  But the time we have left, tell us in this short segment, or the time we have left in the segment, the short,
[02:13:49.858 --> 02:13:56.380]  About yourself, how you got touched by God, what it feels like, how you know, or is it visual, or is it in the spirit?
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:09.983]  And then go back to, you guys tape in November, it airs in March, four months before this happens, you would describe him hitting the ground, and then Trump even said when he hit the ground, he felt God so strong, he even said that.
[02:14:10.444 --> 02:14:12.704]  And then he said, I got way stronger in God.
[02:14:12.924 --> 02:14:15.105]  Word for word, what God told you.
[02:14:15.145 --> 02:14:19.146]  So tell us about yourself, and then what it's like when you're given this prophetic information.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:20.300]  Okay.
[02:14:21.481 --> 02:14:23.322]  Well, I'll tell you about myself.
[02:14:23.682 --> 02:14:29.705]  You know, I've been a person to just to seek the Lord on my heart, with all my heart, basically since I was a kid.
[02:14:30.225 --> 02:14:36.829]  You know, I felt a call in my life since I was probably, you know, probably 10 years old.
[02:14:37.349 --> 02:14:41.551]  I started seeing in the Spirit like what I'm talking about when I was 16 years old.
[02:14:41.571 --> 02:14:42.892]  I just started praying.
[02:14:43.272 --> 02:14:46.133]  And then whenever I start praying, I feel the presence of the Lord.
[02:14:46.453 --> 02:14:46.894]  My ears,
[02:14:47.594 --> 02:14:51.295]  You know, it's going to sound really strange, but my ears will get really hot.
[02:14:51.375 --> 02:14:56.317]  Like, like I have a match on my ears and they get like really warm.
[02:14:56.657 --> 02:14:57.078]  Absolutely.
[02:14:57.318 --> 02:14:58.078]  My head gets hot.
[02:14:58.518 --> 02:14:59.599]  It's like, exactly.
[02:14:59.839 --> 02:15:00.459]  I felt that too.
[02:15:01.812 --> 02:15:10.140]  And then all of a sudden, I see pictures, and they come up before me like a movie screen, all in front of my face, and I see them.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:18.468]  And then a lot of times, like I've had visitations from the Lord personally, and He'll come and talk to me and tell me about what's coming.
[02:15:19.028 --> 02:15:20.149]  And he'll warn me.
[02:15:20.369 --> 02:15:22.231]  And I said, Lord, who am I?
[02:15:22.811 --> 02:15:25.153]  I've been a janitor my whole life.
[02:15:25.353 --> 02:15:28.696]  I've cleaned and now I do eBay and things like that.
[02:15:28.776 --> 02:15:32.238]  But I had very little education.
[02:15:32.299 --> 02:15:34.420]  I had learning disabilities my whole life.
[02:15:34.901 --> 02:15:35.781]  I could barely read.
[02:15:35.801 --> 02:15:38.643]  I was basically an outcast.
[02:15:38.784 --> 02:15:40.445]  I was bullied my whole life.
[02:15:42.006 --> 02:15:50.392]  I've just always had a desire and a hunger to know Jesus, and I started going and being a janitor at a church.
[02:15:50.432 --> 02:15:53.514]  I was a janitor for 13 years, cleaning toilets.
[02:15:53.534 --> 02:15:56.717]  I cleaned 90 toilets every other day.
[02:15:57.117 --> 02:16:00.880]  On Wednesdays and Saturdays and Sundays, I cleaned the bathrooms, and that's how I did it.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.921]  I just stayed in those bathrooms.
[02:16:02.981 --> 02:16:05.023]  I prayed and helped out with the church.
[02:16:06.064 --> 02:16:12.950]  And over that time, I developed a relationship with the Lord, and He would just start coming and talking to me and telling me things that were coming.
[02:16:13.471 --> 02:16:15.933]  And this has been happening, like I said, for a long time.
[02:16:16.454 --> 02:16:24.262]  I was always by myself, and then all of a sudden He came to me and He said, Brandon, I want you to go on YouTube, and I want you to tell my people that I'm coming.
[02:16:24.722 --> 02:16:33.048]  And there's going to be a major revival, and there's going to be these things take place, and I need you to warn my people of the things that I've showed you.
[02:16:33.448 --> 02:16:35.610]  And I said, Lord, they're not going to listen to me.
[02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:37.851]  And he said, Brandon, I need you to do this.
[02:16:38.292 --> 02:16:39.413]  And I said, I will do it.
[02:16:39.813 --> 02:16:46.358]  So I started a YouTube channel a year ago, about this time last year, and it's just taken off.
[02:16:48.739 --> 02:16:48.939]  Right.
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:56.024]  Pastor Steve along and he said, I want you to go on there and talk to him and tell him some of the things I'm sharing with you.
[02:16:56.104 --> 02:16:56.844]  And that's beautiful.
[02:16:56.864 --> 02:17:01.547]  So tell us about, because you've talked about some of the specifics every little bit.
[02:17:01.988 --> 02:17:02.588]  Where were you?
[02:17:02.628 --> 02:17:05.109]  What was happening when God told you what was going to happen to Trump?
[02:17:05.210 --> 02:17:07.191]  You perfectly described it with precision.
[02:17:08.914 --> 02:17:12.516]  I was just praying, and just like I normally do, I pray at night for the nation.
[02:17:12.556 --> 02:17:14.117]  I pray for people like you.
[02:17:14.177 --> 02:17:18.540]  I pray for the patriots to come out and pray for our nation.
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:19.460]  I do it all the time.
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.562]  I pray for even Joe Biden, and it's hard to do, but I do.
[02:17:23.082 --> 02:17:27.645]  But I pray for God to bring a revival back to America again.
[02:17:28.445 --> 02:17:34.747]  And, um, and just like I was just praying, just like on a normal night, all of a sudden the Lord told me, he said, this is what's going to come this year.
[02:17:34.827 --> 02:17:38.448]  And I need you to pray over president Trump because they're going to try to kill him.
[02:17:38.908 --> 02:17:41.209]  And he said, he said, we can stop this.
[02:17:41.409 --> 02:17:42.229]  You, it was a lot.
[02:17:42.249 --> 02:17:45.190]  And he said, you send the angel son and they're going to protect him.
[02:17:45.611 --> 02:17:53.193]  But when this takes place and what happens with, with president Trump, this will be a thing that will, he's going to go through refiner's fire.
[02:17:53.593 --> 02:18:00.496]  The Lord said this to me and he said, in this refiner's fire, he said, I'm going to I'm going to bring about a new Trump.
[02:18:00.696 --> 02:18:05.778]  Basically, I saw a rebirthing of him inside and he was going to get radically born again.
[02:18:06.278 --> 02:18:12.961]  And the Lord told me, he said, Brandon, this is it's going to be so much of a change on him that it went over the time.
[02:18:13.021 --> 02:18:13.401]  I saw him.
[02:18:13.621 --> 02:18:14.181]  I'm talking.
[02:18:14.561 --> 02:18:18.563]  He even looked and what was interesting in the vision, he even loses some weight.
[02:18:19.263 --> 02:18:19.944]  And but
[02:18:22.118 --> 02:18:32.044]  He becomes like a supernatural wisdom comes on him from the Lord when he wins the office again this year.
[02:18:32.124 --> 02:18:36.407]  I believe with all my heart he's going to win and he's going to win by a landslide.
[02:18:37.387 --> 02:18:41.810]  In the vision, did you see the scene?
[02:18:42.510 --> 02:18:43.471]  Was it the scene you saw?
[02:18:44.031 --> 02:18:45.052]  Or was it just the imprint?
[02:18:45.072 --> 02:18:45.872]  They're going to try to kill him.
[02:18:46.132 --> 02:18:46.873]  He'll get shot in the ear.
[02:18:47.495 --> 02:18:48.455]  It was identical.
[02:18:48.655 --> 02:18:56.918]  And whenever I saw him fall to the ground, he fell to the ground, I saw him, I saw blood flowing down his head right here.
[02:18:57.278 --> 02:19:00.039]  But everybody said, well, you missed it because his eardrum didn't bust.
[02:19:00.839 --> 02:19:04.420]  I just saw the bullet like, you know, like the Matrix, the waves coming off.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:08.281]  I saw the energy coming up and I saw the blood flowing down his head.
[02:19:08.721 --> 02:19:11.342]  So I thought, surely that, because I didn't see the bullet.
[02:19:11.362 --> 02:19:12.342]  Sure, that was your interpretation.
[02:19:13.294 --> 02:19:13.494]  Yes.
[02:19:13.734 --> 02:19:14.174]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:14.454 --> 02:19:18.936]  And so I saw the bullet go by, but I never saw it touch his ear up here.
[02:19:19.396 --> 02:19:20.717]  I just saw blood flowing down.
[02:19:20.757 --> 02:19:25.379]  So I thought the only thing that would cause all that blood would have to be an eardrum bust or something.
[02:19:25.779 --> 02:19:29.360]  So that's me looking into a vision saying, this is how, what I saw.
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:30.581]  And so everybody said, well, you missed it.
[02:19:30.601 --> 02:19:32.442]  And I say, no, that's just my interpretation.
[02:19:32.522 --> 02:19:36.123]  You would say he falls down and comes back up a new man, like he's baptized.
[02:19:37.204 --> 02:19:37.604]  That's right.
[02:19:37.964 --> 02:19:40.345]  And I said, he's going to, he's going to become radically born again.
[02:19:42.078 --> 02:19:45.084]  And when you describe, when I get one of these imprints from God, it's the same thing.
[02:19:45.104 --> 02:19:47.108]  It starts in the ears, it's like fire.
[02:19:47.168 --> 02:19:48.110]  It's like Pentecost.
[02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:49.212]  I feel like fire.
[02:19:49.693 --> 02:19:51.497]  And then it's like, oh, I'm about to get the download.
[02:19:51.918 --> 02:19:52.499]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:52.539 --> 02:19:52.919]  Stay with us.
[02:19:54.161 --> 02:20:05.887]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz, we know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:20:06.287 --> 02:20:11.050]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:15.412]  They thought by canceling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:20:15.532 --> 02:20:17.093]  But the bad news is for them,
[02:20:17.873 --> 02:20:18.973]  We continue to do it.
[02:20:19.374 --> 02:20:21.194]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:20:21.535 --> 02:20:27.577]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:20:27.897 --> 02:20:30.358]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:20:30.518 --> 02:20:35.380]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:37.161]  So our job is really simple.
[02:20:37.621 --> 02:20:38.122]  Share this.
[02:20:38.202 --> 02:20:38.962]  Communicate this.
[02:20:39.022 --> 02:20:40.804]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:20:41.204 --> 02:20:46.649]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for products to keep strong and prepared.
[02:20:46.970 --> 02:20:51.133]  Donate and share the videos at Band.Video.
[02:20:53.035 --> 02:20:53.756]  Look around you.
[02:20:53.796 --> 02:20:57.679]  You're on a gorgeous planet in an amazing universe made by God.
[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:00.362]  And there are spiritual forces all around us.
[02:21:01.122 --> 02:21:03.344]  The devil's greatest trick was to convince the world he didn't exist.
[02:21:04.384 --> 02:21:06.466]  We got two great pastors on with us.
[02:21:06.506 --> 02:21:12.211]  Pastor Brandon Biggs, who made this amazing prophetic prediction, is now making new ones.
[02:21:12.331 --> 02:21:18.156]  And we have his pastor friend who helped bring this to light, Steve Coccolati.
[02:21:18.797 --> 02:21:22.040]  And I want both of you guys to have the floor in the 30 minutes we have left.
[02:21:22.060 --> 02:21:23.801]  We'll definitely have you back up again soon.
[02:21:24.482 --> 02:21:27.625]  But Pastor Brandon Biggs, people can find you at Last Days 247.
[02:21:29.366 --> 02:21:37.210]  And of course, people can also find the other pastor, Steve, at discoverchurch.online and on YouTube, Discover Ministries.
[02:21:38.731 --> 02:21:56.761]  So moving past now, your vision of Trump that's on record months before, four months before released, and then now what you're seeing going into the future with this plague coming upon the earth, what else did you see?
[02:21:58.194 --> 02:22:09.657]  I saw a major financial depression coming and I saw it was so bad that people that were it happened so fast and so suddenly I was like is like overnight.
[02:22:11.889 --> 02:22:18.854]  People were standing in lines for food that even had, like, you know, people had nice suits on that looked brioni.
[02:22:18.914 --> 02:22:20.656]  I'm talking very rich people.
[02:22:20.696 --> 02:22:23.758]  The Lord showed me that they were very, very classy, rich people.
[02:22:23.798 --> 02:22:27.921]  They were not people that would be standing on a street corner that looked dirty or whatever, you know.
[02:22:28.401 --> 02:22:30.063]  These were people that had wealth.
[02:22:30.783 --> 02:22:32.704]  And they were standing in lines for food.
[02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:34.984]  And the Lord showed me, this was interesting, too.
[02:22:35.024 --> 02:22:37.505]  He showed me cobwebs on the store shelves.
[02:22:37.885 --> 02:22:45.827]  And I saw, and I believe that represents an extended period of time of no food, that their cobwebs would be there.
[02:22:46.468 --> 02:22:48.808]  And so the Lord showed me this was coming.
[02:22:49.288 --> 02:22:49.789]  But, you know,
[02:22:51.758 --> 02:23:01.284]  You know, it happened, like I said, in the vision, whenever I was seeing Trump and the things the Lord showed me about that, after that, He showed me a massive crash coming.
[02:23:01.364 --> 02:23:02.705]  He showed me all this stuff.
[02:23:03.266 --> 02:23:18.876]  And He told me that, like I've explained in that vision, that I saw these electric shockers coming upon the land when Trump was praying and crying out for the Lord to intervene.
[02:23:18.896 --> 02:23:19.797]  And I saw
[02:23:22.138 --> 02:23:29.662]  Like, that heaviness of the depression lifting above, like, you know, in the vision, it was like I saw it was below the tree line.
[02:23:30.123 --> 02:23:36.006]  And then the Lord showed me that lifting above, and that Trump was going to help out America with the finances.
[02:23:36.586 --> 02:23:38.027]  But it was going to take time.
[02:23:40.348 --> 02:23:51.475]  He was, like I said, with that supernatural wisdom, the Lord was going to help him as we, you know, because the Bible says, if we humble ourselves and pray and turn from our wicked ways, then the Lord will heal our land.
[02:23:52.035 --> 02:23:55.478]  But if we don't humble ourselves and we pray and turn from our wicked ways,
[02:23:56.599 --> 02:23:58.921]  We're not going to see the result of the healing of the land.
[02:23:59.522 --> 02:24:15.999]  So I really believe as we get leaders, godly leaders, and people crying out for repentance and things, that we're going to see a rebirthing of America, a rebirthing of what we all desire, a better place.
[02:24:18.001 --> 02:24:26.725]  Until that happens, we have these evil, evil people running our nation, and so we need godly leadership.
[02:24:26.846 --> 02:24:27.446]  Absolutely.
[02:24:27.526 --> 02:24:30.507]  I want to bring in Pastor Chocolate here.
[02:24:31.628 --> 02:24:37.431]  How did you get to know this amazing individual, and how did God lead you to Brandon Biggs?
[02:24:39.346 --> 02:24:43.308]  Well, I've got a YouTube channel, and I've always tried to feature other people.
[02:24:43.368 --> 02:24:54.634]  It doesn't always work out, but with Brandon, I saw a vision that he gave about the tribulation, and it's, you know, my role, my call for 25 years.
[02:24:54.754 --> 02:25:00.977]  I teach on end-time prophecy, and I heard the vision, and I said, you know, number one, this lines up with the Word of God.
[02:25:01.557 --> 02:25:06.419]  Number two, it lines up with a bunch of other visions that the Lord has shown me and that I've studied.
[02:25:06.979 --> 02:25:13.561]  So, I featured that and I think that was, you know, helped a lot of people get to know his YouTube channel.
[02:25:14.282 --> 02:25:21.024]  And we just stayed friends, we became friends, and as we prayed together sometimes and we just get things, we would share it.
[02:25:21.084 --> 02:25:26.086]  We don't share a lot of it because, you know, it's almost like if you share too much and you share too exactly,
[02:25:26.886 --> 02:25:29.749]  The enemy says, well, it's self-fulfilling.
[02:25:30.069 --> 02:25:30.950]  So what a dilemma.
[02:25:31.131 --> 02:25:33.113]  If you share it, they say it's self-fulfilling.
[02:25:33.173 --> 02:25:36.877]  If you don't share it, they say God's not real, he's not talking, he's not revealing.
[02:25:37.397 --> 02:25:38.839]  So we have to kind of parse it out.
[02:25:38.859 --> 02:25:47.448]  And as you said, you shot this in November, but what was the process of taping this and then deciding to share this, and then that comes true?
[02:25:48.809 --> 02:25:52.690]  So I'm in Florida, so I came from Australia.
[02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:57.032]  I'm a pastor from Australia, and the Lord told me to move here for the Great Awakening.
[02:25:57.892 --> 02:26:00.593]  And because we're friends, I was in Tulsa.
[02:26:00.653 --> 02:26:01.553]  I'm friends with Clay Clark.
[02:26:01.593 --> 02:26:02.513]  We're in his house, actually.
[02:26:02.533 --> 02:26:04.334]  That was shot in Clay Clark's living room.
[02:26:05.274 --> 02:26:10.097]  And Brandon came out to meet me and I just decided, you know, that was not a fancy thing.
[02:26:10.117 --> 02:26:10.937]  That was an iPhone.
[02:26:10.957 --> 02:26:11.897]  That was my iPhone.
[02:26:12.578 --> 02:26:15.699]  We flipped it, put a mic on Brandon and said, let's just go.
[02:26:15.759 --> 02:26:20.702]  Let's just share what's happening because people don't believe the spiritual realm.
[02:26:20.742 --> 02:26:22.162]  They think it's all materialism.
[02:26:22.202 --> 02:26:25.004]  They're just chasing money all day and don't realize what's coming.
[02:26:25.484 --> 02:26:27.165]  There's a global famine that's coming.
[02:26:27.205 --> 02:26:29.347]  That's one of the things the Lord's clearly revealed.
[02:26:29.707 --> 02:26:31.508]  There is another plague that's coming.
[02:26:31.988 --> 02:26:38.272]  So let's share and hopefully, our heart is, hopefully the leaders of this country turn around and not just take all the bad advice.
[02:26:38.292 --> 02:26:39.193]  That's where I was going next.
[02:26:39.333 --> 02:26:47.158]  I feel like this is a warning to Trump to accept this office so that he, we know God's touched him at a higher level.
[02:26:47.798 --> 02:26:50.300]  This is a message we know will, in one way or another, get to Trump.
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.122]  He needs to step into this and take this mission.
[02:26:54.497 --> 02:26:55.038]  That's right.
[02:26:55.578 --> 02:27:01.065]  One year before he supposedly lost the election, I already had 10 prophecies to save America.
[02:27:01.105 --> 02:27:03.388]  God downloaded 10 things to save America.
[02:27:03.768 --> 02:27:12.720]  You can go back to that book, Trump's Unfinished Business, which I'm almost sorry that the name was so prophetic, but the Lord gave it to me, Trump's Unfinished Business.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:14.081]  We're good to go.
[02:27:33.677 --> 02:27:34.338]  It's only God to win this.
[02:27:34.358 --> 02:27:39.249]  He can't do it alone, which I was saying in the weeks before he got shot and you're saying that's your mission here.
[02:27:39.790 --> 02:27:40.492]  Are you hardened?
[02:27:40.512 --> 02:27:44.039]  It appears he's making a major turn towards saying it's only God.
[02:27:45.714 --> 02:27:47.635]  Yeah, I like, you know, obviously I'm heartened.
[02:27:47.675 --> 02:27:49.056]  I'm so thankful he's alive.
[02:27:49.096 --> 02:27:52.417]  I'm so thankful the Lord, you know, gave a prophecy that's so undeniable.
[02:27:53.017 --> 02:27:57.960]  At the same time, I would say that he needs to go one step further, and he needs to call on the name of Jesus.
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:03.162]  I don't really hear him publicly say Jesus unless he's in a Christian meeting, like maybe Turning Point or something like that.
[02:28:03.502 --> 02:28:06.623]  Then he'll say, but he kind of skirts around the issue, and it's not time.
[02:28:06.663 --> 02:28:07.524]  This is life and death.
[02:28:07.864 --> 02:28:10.725]  Well, that's because political advisors are telling him, don't turn off other groups.
[02:28:10.825 --> 02:28:11.025]  No.
[02:28:11.325 --> 02:28:17.407]  He must publicly, in the maximum form, call out the name of Jesus Christ, and he'll have the full armor at that point.
[02:28:18.847 --> 02:28:19.328]  Exactly.
[02:28:19.368 --> 02:28:20.488]  The full grace of heaven.
[02:28:20.888 --> 02:28:24.949]  I heard the full grace of heaven will be poured out upon him, upon you, Alex.
[02:28:24.989 --> 02:28:27.230]  You're very important to this plan for freedom.
[02:28:27.970 --> 02:28:29.651]  What you do affects the rest of the world.
[02:28:29.671 --> 02:28:33.032]  It affects us in Australia, when I was pastoring there.
[02:28:33.752 --> 02:28:35.895]  So he needs to get into the word for himself.
[02:28:35.935 --> 02:28:37.417]  God will not accept a substitute.
[02:28:37.578 --> 02:28:42.524]  God will not use even us as prophets or advisors to be a substitute for him.
[02:28:42.625 --> 02:28:45.829]  He's a jealous God and he wants Trump to have a relationship.
[02:28:45.869 --> 02:28:48.653]  That means he's got to quote the word for himself.
[02:28:48.773 --> 02:28:50.676]  Trump has to fully bend the knee to God.
[02:28:51.604 --> 02:28:53.005]  He has to bend the knee, exactly.
[02:28:53.025 --> 02:28:54.867]  And that was metaphorical, what happened.
[02:28:55.187 --> 02:28:58.230]  He was brought to his knees, but it wasn't voluntary that first time.
[02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:00.311]  He has to do it voluntarily.
[02:29:00.571 --> 02:29:02.793]  And Kim Clement said that he will be filled with the Spirit.
[02:29:03.454 --> 02:29:06.216]  So we have to, we, you know, none of the prophets get everything.
[02:29:06.276 --> 02:29:07.517]  We see in part, we know in part.
[02:29:08.138 --> 02:29:09.279]  So we piece it together.
[02:29:09.819 --> 02:29:13.302]  The part that I bring for Brandon, he's an amazing gifted individual.
[02:29:13.722 --> 02:29:15.504]  What I bring is I just ground him.
[02:29:15.564 --> 02:29:17.846]  I try to ground everything that I hear in the Word of God.
[02:29:18.486 --> 02:29:23.150]  And I try to put it in the timeline, because the timeline is the most, you know, important thing.
[02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:27.514]  If you get the wrong timing, you will make the wrong decision having the right information.
[02:29:27.694 --> 02:29:28.795]  So timing is everything.
[02:29:29.596 --> 02:29:30.436]  And I try to do that.
[02:29:30.456 --> 02:29:31.758]  I try to draw people back.
[02:29:31.878 --> 02:29:33.359]  Why is it that we're getting these words?
[02:29:33.559 --> 02:29:35.200]  It's actually pointing us to Revelation 6.
[02:29:36.041 --> 02:29:40.325]  And if we have time in the show, I'd like to show the audience what they may have never heard.
[02:29:40.345 --> 02:29:40.925]  Please speak to it!
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:42.380]  Speak to it.
[02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.922]  Alright, well, can we bring up some slides?
[02:29:44.962 --> 02:29:46.583]  I want to show you Revelation 6.
[02:29:46.843 --> 02:29:49.165]  While they're doing that, I'm going to read just the beginning of the seals.
[02:29:49.465 --> 02:29:52.187]  This is the most famous part of Revelation, right?
[02:29:52.247 --> 02:29:54.448]  Everybody's heard about this, the four horsemen.
[02:29:54.468 --> 02:29:58.210]  I'm just going to read a couple of verses, not the whole thing, but just to set the scene.
[02:29:58.671 --> 02:30:04.194]  Now I saw, this is John, the writer of Revelation, the one that walked with Jesus for three and a half years.
[02:30:04.975 --> 02:30:07.516]  He said he was given this vision about our time.
[02:30:08.117 --> 02:30:11.119]  Now I saw when the Lamb, that's Jesus, opened one of the seals,
[02:30:12.318 --> 02:30:13.699]  And the question is, when does he do this?
[02:30:13.899 --> 02:30:14.159]  Alright?
[02:30:14.479 --> 02:30:18.901]  And I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a loud voice like thunder, come and see.
[02:30:19.201 --> 02:30:20.602]  And I looked and behold, a white horse.
[02:30:21.322 --> 02:30:25.064]  He who sat on it had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer.
[02:30:25.764 --> 02:30:30.466]  So when the pandemic was happening, I was in the worst lockdown city in the world.
[02:30:30.566 --> 02:30:33.908]  We were more locked down in Melbourne, Australia than in North Korea.
[02:30:34.688 --> 02:30:37.529]  And the Lord showed me this verse and said, it's begun.
[02:30:37.949 --> 02:30:38.549]  I said, how?
[02:30:39.109 --> 02:30:41.150]  Because I've never heard it in Bible school.
[02:30:41.170 --> 02:30:45.111]  You know, most pastors just teach what was taught in their Bible school curriculum.
[02:30:45.651 --> 02:30:47.192]  And he said, look at it, the white horse.
[02:30:47.392 --> 02:30:48.252]  I've given you a clue.
[02:30:48.292 --> 02:30:49.432]  The collar is white.
[02:30:49.572 --> 02:30:51.053]  There's a profession that wears white.
[02:30:51.373 --> 02:30:54.314]  We know clearly it's a pharmaceutical medical industry.
[02:30:55.074 --> 02:30:57.455]  Then it says he who sat on it had a bow.
[02:30:57.675 --> 02:31:05.957]  The word bow there is a toxon because the arrow that's used in the bow had to be dipped in poison in order to deliver the killing agent through the skin.
[02:31:06.597 --> 02:31:13.499]  Then he was given a crown, which if you read in Spanish, which I've done when I preach in El Salvador, Honduras, I said, please read that to me in Spanish.
[02:31:13.519 --> 02:31:14.219]  What does it say?
[02:31:14.319 --> 02:31:15.459]  And they will say Corona.
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.300]  And I said, can you please say it again?
[02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:18.380]  They say Corona.
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:20.841]  And I said, and what was the pandemic we just had?
[02:31:21.301 --> 02:31:27.910]  And the jaws of the pastors would drop because even when they hear it, it doesn't register because we've been religiously brainwashed.
[02:31:28.171 --> 02:31:30.214]  We think Revelation 6 can't be happening.
[02:31:30.254 --> 02:31:32.877]  He's given a needle a bow to give you Corona.
[02:31:32.897 --> 02:31:33.699]  It actually says it.
[02:31:34.642 --> 02:31:36.843]  It actually says it right there, so that's the white horse.
[02:31:37.263 --> 02:31:41.725]  So I started going out publicly and saying, look, I know this is not the typical American teaching.
[02:31:41.785 --> 02:31:47.167]  Everybody says you got to rapture first, and I believe in the rapture and all that, but this is running.
[02:31:47.387 --> 02:31:52.109]  You cannot go by what the Bible school has taught or what we've assumed for 40, 50 years.
[02:31:52.749 --> 02:31:54.190]  God is saying it's been triggered.
[02:31:54.610 --> 02:31:56.651]  So then I start looking at, well, what's the timeline?
[02:31:56.671 --> 02:31:58.752]  And he went forth conquering and to conquer.
[02:31:59.312 --> 02:32:03.877]  So coronavirus was the first truly global event since Noah's flood.
[02:32:03.897 --> 02:32:07.761]  And he said, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man.
[02:32:08.181 --> 02:32:09.983]  So we know, boom, we're triggered.
[02:32:10.003 --> 02:32:13.907]  9-11 was one trigger, but COVID-19 was the trigger.
[02:32:14.108 --> 02:32:15.469]  Just like the Exodus was triggered by a plague.
[02:32:15.489 --> 02:32:16.090]  So the clock is running.
[02:32:16.701 --> 02:32:17.382]  The clock is running.
[02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:19.623]  So now the issue is, what do we do?
[02:32:20.184 --> 02:32:27.969]  Now, according to Revelation 6, which we're not going to have to, we can't do all of it, but I want to show you something, I want to show the audience something that they'll never forget.
[02:32:28.029 --> 02:32:31.152]  So we're not going into details, we're going to stay broad, big perspective.
[02:32:31.892 --> 02:32:32.873]  Who is the enemy?
[02:32:32.973 --> 02:32:34.234]  What are we looking for?
[02:32:34.694 --> 02:32:38.397]  This is going to surprise most people, especially if they're following geopolitics.
[02:32:38.918 --> 02:32:40.719]  Go ahead and go to the next one.
[02:32:42.884 --> 02:32:44.565]  Okay, so there are four horses.
[02:32:44.605 --> 02:32:47.868]  The first is white, next is red, next is black, the third is black.
[02:32:47.988 --> 02:32:48.869]  That's the global famine.
[02:32:49.229 --> 02:32:53.613]  Then the last one is a controversial one because in English you got all different translations.
[02:32:53.833 --> 02:32:55.794]  But I go to the Greek and it says chloros.
[02:32:56.055 --> 02:32:59.878]  That's the word for chloro, you know, we get the root word chlorophyll out of chloros.
[02:32:59.918 --> 02:33:01.179]  So that's green.
[02:33:01.839 --> 02:33:04.461]  So I said, well, what is God saying?
[02:33:04.581 --> 02:33:06.163]  Why these four colors?
[02:33:06.483 --> 02:33:07.564]  What is this about?
[02:33:09.345 --> 02:33:11.367]  So there's information contained in the Word of God.
[02:33:12.602 --> 02:33:15.323]  Now what's in the four colors of the flag of Palestine?
[02:33:16.964 --> 02:33:17.604]  What's in the four?
[02:33:17.824 --> 02:33:22.946]  So you see, the four colors, white, red, black, green in the flag of Jordan, they're different by one star.
[02:33:23.287 --> 02:33:25.487]  That tells you that they're cousins, they're brothers.
[02:33:26.148 --> 02:33:31.710]  Anytime you see like the Australian flag and New Zealand flag, they look alike, they're related to each other in history, language, ethnicity.
[02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:33.691]  Go to the next one, maybe it's a coincidence.
[02:33:34.151 --> 02:33:36.152]  What are the four colors on the flag of Sudan?
[02:33:36.432 --> 02:33:40.254]  It's an Islamic nation that's prophesied in Ezekiel 38 to attack Israel.
[02:33:40.954 --> 02:33:42.415]  The four colors on the flag of Kuwait.
[02:33:42.935 --> 02:33:43.915]  Maybe it's a coincidence?
[02:33:44.175 --> 02:33:44.595]  Next one.
[02:33:44.676 --> 02:33:45.916]  This United Arab Emirates.
[02:33:45.996 --> 02:33:46.976]  White, red, black, green.
[02:33:47.036 --> 02:33:47.457]  Next one.
[02:33:48.037 --> 02:33:49.557]  White, red, black, green for Libya.
[02:33:50.058 --> 02:33:50.498]  Next one.
[02:33:50.898 --> 02:33:52.659]  White, red, black, green for Afghanistan.
[02:33:52.739 --> 02:33:53.159]  Next one.
[02:33:53.759 --> 02:33:55.180]  White, red, black, green for Syria.
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:55.940]  Iraq.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.262]  And you see when ISIS tried to combine Iraq and Syria together, they call it, you know, ISIS.
[02:34:00.302 --> 02:34:02.883]  They wanted to unify the Levant.
[02:34:02.943 --> 02:34:04.963]  You see by the flag that they're related to each other.
[02:34:04.983 --> 02:34:06.204]  They're different just by one star.
[02:34:06.864 --> 02:34:07.584]  Go to the next one.
[02:34:07.624 --> 02:34:11.465]  The only one that's different is the white, red, and green.
[02:34:11.625 --> 02:34:11.885]  Why?
[02:34:12.005 --> 02:34:14.946]  Because Iran is different from the rest of them.
[02:34:15.306 --> 02:34:16.006]  They're Shia.
[02:34:16.607 --> 02:34:21.648]  Most of the other Arab nations that God is warning about in the end time, they're Sunnis.
[02:34:22.508 --> 02:34:23.248]  Go to the next one.
[02:34:23.688 --> 02:34:25.969]  Now, people will say, you know, they don't believe God.
[02:34:25.989 --> 02:34:26.789]  They don't believe the Bible.
[02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:27.429]  It's a coincidence.
[02:34:27.549 --> 02:34:29.070]  I say, well, look at the other flags.
[02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:30.862]  Is this a coincidence?
[02:34:30.902 --> 02:34:33.206]  Look, that's America, Russia, Thailand, Israel.
[02:34:33.646 --> 02:34:34.488]  It's not a coincidence.
[02:34:34.508 --> 02:34:35.490]  So what's God saying?
[02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:36.251]  Next one.
[02:34:37.185 --> 02:34:49.312]  So the trigger for the Antichrist to come, this tyranny, this police state that's going to spy us, tax us, kill us, and persecute Christians like Christians in America have never thought possible.
[02:34:50.013 --> 02:34:52.194]  The trigger is going to be these four colors.
[02:34:52.935 --> 02:34:54.235]  Go to what we're seeing.
[02:34:54.796 --> 02:34:55.556]  This is a rally.
[02:34:55.576 --> 02:34:57.677]  This is at Harvard University.
[02:34:57.798 --> 02:35:00.479]  Now the picture is blurry, but you can see white, red, black, green.
[02:35:00.879 --> 02:35:01.280]  Next one.
[02:35:02.128 --> 02:35:05.129]  They want to teach about Palestine in our American school.
[02:35:05.149 --> 02:35:09.931]  This is the Oregon curriculum, the new proposed curriculum for elementary school.
[02:35:10.151 --> 02:35:10.551]  Next one.
[02:35:11.291 --> 02:35:12.791]  This is stand with Palestine.
[02:35:12.811 --> 02:35:14.612]  You see that all over social media.
[02:35:14.812 --> 02:35:15.212]  Next one.
[02:35:15.932 --> 02:35:17.773]  Okay, this is in Australia, Melbourne, Australia.
[02:35:17.813 --> 02:35:18.333]  They're flying that.
[02:35:18.353 --> 02:35:19.594]  They're not flying the Australian flag.
[02:35:19.614 --> 02:35:20.554]  They're flying that flag.
[02:35:21.872 --> 02:35:22.813]  This is in Chicago.
[02:35:22.953 --> 02:35:25.596]  They're hoisting up this flag instead of the American flag.
[02:35:25.997 --> 02:35:28.359]  You see exactly what the Bible said.
[02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:29.901]  Look for these colors.
[02:35:30.021 --> 02:35:34.146]  When the trigger comes, when the countdown comes, you start preparing.
[02:35:34.266 --> 02:35:35.607]  And what is the timeline?
[02:35:35.968 --> 02:35:37.169]  You start with these colors.
[02:35:37.289 --> 02:35:37.689]  Next one.
[02:35:37.709 --> 02:35:41.594]  Who's saying an Islamic triggered war brings in the end times?
[02:35:43.015 --> 02:35:53.425]  Yes, and the Antichrist, I think the epicenter has been wrongly taught because America is a bit American-centric and because the ancestors of Americans usually have come from Europe.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:35:57.629]  We have a very Euro-centric gospel, Euro-centric eschatology.
[02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:59.571]  I think it's partially right.
[02:35:59.591 --> 02:36:01.173]  I'm not saying it's wrong entirely.
[02:36:01.653 --> 02:36:07.580]  But the center of the Bible and the center of the Antichrist beast system is going to eventually be in the Middle East.
[02:36:08.041 --> 02:36:10.204]  And this is where Obama is very interesting.
[02:36:10.704 --> 02:36:19.976]  I had a dream just before this show a few, say a couple of months ago, where I saw Obama and he did, in the dream I heard, he did the old switcheroo.
[02:36:20.788 --> 02:36:22.749]  Now that was before Biden dropped out and all that.
[02:36:22.949 --> 02:36:26.370]  And I also prophesied and I said, I have the date for when he will drop out.
[02:36:26.390 --> 02:36:27.110]  And that's on YouTube.
[02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:30.751]  The exact date of it within, you know, about 14 hours.
[02:36:31.631 --> 02:36:36.833]  And he said, in my dream... By the way, I'm not trying to... God's talking to us.
[02:36:37.153 --> 02:36:38.294]  I called the same day, the 20th, 21st as well.
[02:36:40.267 --> 02:36:40.667]  That's right.
[02:36:40.807 --> 02:36:44.371]  Well, it's in prophecy because it's exactly the three-and-a-half-year mark.
[02:36:44.451 --> 02:36:48.554]  God is showing, number one, the four colors, number two, the three-and-a-half-year cycle.
[02:36:48.995 --> 02:36:56.682]  That happens again and again with Jesus' ministry, the Antichrist ministry, but now we know even Fauci had a three-and-a-half-year reign of deceiving the whole world.
[02:36:57.342 --> 02:36:58.343]  And I couldn't say that before.
[02:36:58.383 --> 02:37:00.886]  I'd get banned off YouTube and off social media in Australia.
[02:37:01.326 --> 02:37:02.147]  But now we can say it.
[02:37:02.207 --> 02:37:02.647]  Thank God.
[02:37:03.248 --> 02:37:05.550]  So you can see there's Milan.
[02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:06.631]  So you got the color.
[02:37:07.172 --> 02:37:08.293]  You got the time cycle.
[02:37:08.833 --> 02:37:09.274]  Next one.
[02:37:09.394 --> 02:37:09.774]  Look at this.
[02:37:09.834 --> 02:37:11.096]  These are stairs in Europe.
[02:37:12.062 --> 02:37:13.643]  They're embracing their own enemy.
[02:37:14.384 --> 02:37:26.735]  So the trigger for the Antichrist is going to be a giving over of the people, a total deception, where they embrace Islam as all peaceful, Christianity, they're the problem makers, they're the trouble.
[02:37:27.215 --> 02:37:29.657]  And yes, I believe at some point there will be a great disappearance.
[02:37:29.677 --> 02:37:32.540]  They'll probably blame it on UFOs, but we're not there.
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.601]  So we have to focus on what we have to do.
[02:37:34.962 --> 02:37:36.103]  We have to pray for Trump.
[02:37:36.563 --> 02:37:38.745]  We have to pray for the next assassination attempt.
[02:37:39.289 --> 02:37:39.870]  We have to pray.
[02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:51.519]  I predict very exactly in two and a half years, which means in the middle of Trump's second term, will come the global famine.
[02:37:51.579 --> 02:37:54.521]  Which has already been triggered by turning off the fertilizer and everything.
[02:37:55.606 --> 02:37:56.346]  That's what they're doing.
[02:37:56.867 --> 02:37:58.127]  They started that with Sri Lanka.
[02:37:58.327 --> 02:37:59.448]  They tested that in Sri Lanka.
[02:37:59.468 --> 02:38:04.950]  And Sri Lanka had a famine in a country with sun, water, air, you know, rich soil.
[02:38:05.390 --> 02:38:09.091]  They shouldn't have had that famine, but they did it through controlling the fertilizer.
[02:38:09.452 --> 02:38:10.552]  So I think these are tests.
[02:38:10.572 --> 02:38:13.513]  But when they roll it out, everybody will be clamoring for government help.
[02:38:13.773 --> 02:38:15.234]  Everyone will say, oh, please save us.
[02:38:15.674 --> 02:38:17.455]  And they'll be turning to the wrong person.
[02:38:17.555 --> 02:38:20.576]  Rather than turning to Jesus, they'll be turning to the government for help.
[02:38:20.956 --> 02:38:25.099]  And this new police state tyrant is going to be related to Islam.
[02:38:25.119 --> 02:38:29.882]  It's going to be related to the Mark of the Beast, which is a kind of digital control of your buying and selling.
[02:38:29.902 --> 02:38:31.003]  Well, Pastor, let's do this.
[02:38:31.043 --> 02:38:32.784]  Let's do a Saturday or Sunday show.
[02:38:33.424 --> 02:38:34.785]  Two hours commercial free.
[02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:35.506]  Send all your slides.
[02:38:35.526 --> 02:38:35.866]  We'll do that.
[02:38:35.886 --> 02:38:36.626]  We're almost out of time.
[02:38:36.646 --> 02:38:37.747]  We've got seven minutes left.
[02:38:39.548 --> 02:38:49.555]  Closing comments on this, and I want to go back to our other guest here, Brandon Biggs, with any other points he's got.
[02:38:51.462 --> 02:38:55.383]  Yeah, the closing remark for me is that Americans need to prepare.
[02:38:55.423 --> 02:38:56.584]  The church needs to wake up.
[02:38:56.604 --> 02:38:58.865]  And when we say that, I'm very specific about what it is.
[02:38:59.385 --> 02:39:00.886]  We have a very soft gospel.
[02:39:00.926 --> 02:39:04.367]  I've come here, I used to live here, and I've come back after 25 years.
[02:39:04.907 --> 02:39:07.128]  In my opinion, America is unrecognizable.
[02:39:08.058 --> 02:39:10.720]  It's totally clouded over by fear.
[02:39:11.421 --> 02:39:14.463]  Fear of lawsuits, fear of everything.
[02:39:14.763 --> 02:39:16.945]  The church is afraid of prophecy and prophets.
[02:39:17.065 --> 02:39:17.825]  They can't stand it.
[02:39:17.845 --> 02:39:21.648]  You know, Brandon was... Can I say, Brandon, what happened to you when you gave that prophecy?
[02:39:23.009 --> 02:39:24.610]  Do you want to keep it a secret?
[02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:25.711]  I'm not going to name names.
[02:39:27.472 --> 02:39:28.373]  Yeah, I guess you can.
[02:39:28.553 --> 02:39:30.074]  I mean... Hey, let's name the names.
[02:39:30.134 --> 02:39:30.395]  Go ahead.
[02:39:30.415 --> 02:39:30.835]  What happened?
[02:39:31.696 --> 02:39:32.437]  No, no, no.
[02:39:33.178 --> 02:39:35.520]  I want to be kind to people, but this is America.
[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.262]  This is a little microcosm of America.
[02:39:37.843 --> 02:39:42.287]  Brandon's come to me because he couldn't find a church for, God knows, like 10 years he hasn't gone to church.
[02:39:42.548 --> 02:39:43.669]  He can correct me on the number.
[02:39:44.229 --> 02:39:46.612]  He came to me, but he said, you know, I want my kids to go to church.
[02:39:46.632 --> 02:39:48.474]  I want them to go to youth group and all that.
[02:39:48.914 --> 02:39:51.857]  So he goes to a physical church in Tulsa, famous minister.
[02:39:52.558 --> 02:39:57.760]  And they find out about the video that I did and recorded him and I released on our channel.
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:39:59.401]  It went viral, 2 million views.
[02:39:59.921 --> 02:40:08.264]  And rather than embracing it as God is so merciful and He's warning us, what they did was when he walked in the next weekend, they assigned an usher to him.
[02:40:08.804 --> 02:40:11.045]  Now, I thought at first, that's nice of them.
[02:40:11.485 --> 02:40:11.805]  No, no.
[02:40:12.186 --> 02:40:15.687]  This usher is to walk with him to the bathroom and back.
[02:40:16.247 --> 02:40:18.089]  It's because the churches have become dens of devils.
[02:40:18.109 --> 02:40:21.992]  Yeah, Brandon should be up on the stage, not being harassed.
[02:40:39.372 --> 02:40:39.773]  Exactly.
[02:40:39.913 --> 02:40:41.596]  And that's why I gave him the platform.
[02:40:41.656 --> 02:40:42.217]  I support him.
[02:40:42.257 --> 02:40:42.898]  I pray for him.
[02:40:43.278 --> 02:40:45.221]  But we want to ground everything in the Word of God.
[02:40:45.302 --> 02:40:48.667]  He's got amazing revelation, and my role is just to support and help people.
[02:40:48.687 --> 02:40:48.847]  Exactly.
[02:40:48.867 --> 02:40:51.491]  So, Brandon, the time we have left, anything else you want to add to folks?
[02:40:52.574 --> 02:40:55.056]  You know what, I just want to tell everybody Jesus is coming.
[02:40:57.137 --> 02:41:09.126]  If I walk away with anything today, what I want to tell you all that is in my heart is whenever I went through tribulation and the Lord took me there and He said, I want to show you what's to come.
[02:41:09.746 --> 02:41:13.749]  And I had a whole night full of seeing the Antichrist.
[02:41:13.809 --> 02:41:16.731]  I saw the mark of the beast.
[02:41:16.791 --> 02:41:18.513]  I saw how they insert the chip.
[02:41:19.073 --> 02:41:20.454]  The Lord showed me all this stuff.
[02:41:20.914 --> 02:41:23.636]  I saw how it's going to be like Neuralink.
[02:41:24.216 --> 02:41:29.379]  What everybody doesn't understand is that technology is going to be the Mark of the Beast stuff.
[02:41:29.599 --> 02:41:30.680]  It's that technology.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:35.823]  I'm not saying that Elon Musk is making the Mark of the Beast, but it's the technology behind it.
[02:41:36.463 --> 02:41:38.624]  And I was shown how big the chip is.
[02:41:39.164 --> 02:41:39.865]  I've seen it all.
[02:41:40.385 --> 02:41:45.268]  And the Lord took me there and he said, I want you to go back and I want you to tell my people that I'm coming.
[02:41:47.549 --> 02:41:51.594]  Anything else about your vision of Trump being shot in the ear?
[02:42:10.785 --> 02:42:13.587]  The whole thing about Trump, I mean, is pretty much self-explanatory.
[02:42:13.947 --> 02:42:17.870]  In my heart, I believe that he's going to have a radical encounter with the Lord.
[02:42:18.351 --> 02:42:25.797]  I believe that he's going to help America, and that we're going to have a major red wave in November.
[02:42:26.177 --> 02:42:27.919]  But we have got to get out and vote.
[02:42:28.559 --> 02:42:29.860]  It's not just going to happen.
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:38.244]  The patriots, the Bible-believing believers need to get out and vote righteous people in power.
[02:42:38.764 --> 02:42:41.266]  And then if we do not, our nation is doomed.
[02:42:41.726 --> 02:42:44.768]  I have seen great darkness coming.
[02:42:45.048 --> 02:42:47.349]  A major storm is coming for America.
[02:42:47.709 --> 02:42:51.111]  And the Lord said, Brennan, there will be a humbling coming.
[02:42:51.751 --> 02:42:59.694]  And in this, there will be a great revival that breaks forth, and there will be a major harvest of souls for the Kingdom of God.
[02:43:00.274 --> 02:43:03.355]  But it's going to come out of a hard time.
[02:43:03.456 --> 02:43:08.818]  And I'm telling you all, if you think—I mean, you know, people talk about this, the Great Depression in the 1930s was bad.
[02:43:08.838 --> 02:43:09.098]  Try nowadays.
[02:43:12.939 --> 02:43:14.700]  Back then, they were civil in their thinking.
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:16.341]  Now, people are crazy.
[02:43:16.361 --> 02:43:20.083]  They kill you for some toilet paper, like what we saw during COVID.
[02:43:20.643 --> 02:43:24.205]  So we've got to get back to preaching righteousness in the pulpit.
[02:43:24.385 --> 02:43:30.329]  We've got to get to preaching uncompromising word, not the sugary, watered-down stuff that they're being taught.
[02:43:31.069 --> 02:43:32.030]  True repentance.
[02:43:32.650 --> 02:43:35.171]  And we've got to have a revival in America again.
[02:43:35.732 --> 02:43:37.953]  And that's what I want to tell everybody.
[02:43:38.593 --> 02:43:39.994]  Alright, well thank you so much.
[02:43:40.014 --> 02:43:42.036]  30 seconds left from both of you.
[02:43:42.076 --> 02:43:42.696]  Closing comments.
[02:43:45.499 --> 02:43:52.404]  Well, I want to say, Brandon has a very accurate prophecy about this plague and he forgot to mention something I think everyone should hear.
[02:43:53.005 --> 02:44:00.510]  That virus is going to be linked to obesity drugs, so people who are taking all of these obesity drugs are going to suffer.
[02:44:01.511 --> 02:44:07.114]  And I just believe that if we just follow Jesus, call upon Jesus, that's going to be our safety.
[02:44:07.134 --> 02:44:08.195]  So you need to have a community.
[02:44:08.215 --> 02:44:10.076]  You're not going to be safe alone in these end times.
[02:44:10.596 --> 02:44:12.397]  Make sure you get into a good community.
[02:44:12.957 --> 02:44:15.498]  Brandon and I are together in Discover Church Online.
[02:44:16.539 --> 02:44:20.681]  And, you know, Alex, we just thank you again for all the amazing truth.
[02:44:20.821 --> 02:44:21.922]  You've been fighting so hard.
[02:44:21.942 --> 02:44:23.783]  They've come after you, and we always pray for you.
[02:44:24.583 --> 02:44:25.323]  Thank you, Pastor.
[02:44:25.363 --> 02:44:26.264]  Closing comments, Brandon?
[02:44:27.785 --> 02:44:27.985]  Yeah.
[02:44:28.305 --> 02:44:33.467]  Well, I just want to say thank you all for having me on the show and allowing me to talk about Jesus.
[02:44:33.527 --> 02:44:33.927]  That's all.
[02:44:34.187 --> 02:44:36.048]  You know, it's an honor to be on here.
[02:44:36.108 --> 02:44:41.330]  I've watched you over the years, and you're a true patriot, sir, and I appreciate what you do for this nation.
[02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:43.570]  Well, I'm trying, but we're all together now here.
[02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:44.631]  All we got is God.
[02:44:44.671 --> 02:44:45.171]  That's a lot.
[02:44:45.231 --> 02:44:45.791]  That's everything.
[02:44:46.291 --> 02:44:47.492]  Gentlemen, thank you so much.
[02:44:47.652 --> 02:44:48.672]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:49.192]  God bless.
[02:44:51.693 --> 02:45:02.519]  We've seen a lot of people, and a lot of corporate media, and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying InfoWars will imminently be shut down.
[02:45:22.085 --> 02:45:27.275]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[02:45:28.878 --> 02:45:33.988]  trustee from the Justice Department and five weeks ago ordered this place shut without a court order.
[02:45:35.256 --> 02:45:38.999]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[02:45:39.019 --> 02:45:46.964]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said we wanted to shut down today.
[02:45:47.364 --> 02:45:48.605]  The judge shut that down.
[02:45:49.186 --> 02:45:52.908]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[02:45:52.968 --> 02:45:54.810]  The judge said that's illegal and shut that down.
[02:45:55.050 --> 02:45:55.670]  This is epic.
[02:45:56.130 --> 02:45:57.531]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[02:45:57.591 --> 02:45:58.492]  Because we're fighting.
[02:45:59.072 --> 02:45:59.933]  We're not giving up.
[02:46:00.033 --> 02:46:00.674]  You're praying.
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:07.737]  But I love how five weeks ago I told you this happened, and like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down, and you stood up to them and all this, where's the video?
[02:46:07.937 --> 02:46:10.578]  You want on top of that video, confronting people?
[02:46:10.938 --> 02:46:12.699]  This is serious, I tried to not escalate.
[02:46:13.779 --> 02:46:17.741]  Now it's all in the court record, it's, of course it's true, of course I didn't make this up, I don't cry wolf!
[02:46:18.782 --> 02:46:25.485]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side, and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[02:46:25.525 --> 02:46:30.627]  So, I need all of you to understand, that we're still here for at least three months.
[02:46:31.803 --> 02:46:37.867]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support InfoWarsTore.com with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[02:46:37.887 --> 02:46:38.508]  That's been happening.
[02:46:38.768 --> 02:46:39.789]  People aren't buying stuff.
[02:46:40.469 --> 02:46:42.370]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[02:46:42.390 --> 02:46:43.451]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[02:46:43.511 --> 02:46:43.651]  No.
[02:46:44.012 --> 02:46:45.172]  You order something, you get it.
[02:46:45.533 --> 02:46:52.838]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and buy Mineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[02:46:53.278 --> 02:46:55.620]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:04.526]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:47:05.086 --> 02:47:06.367]  Huge thick book I wrote.
[02:47:06.868 --> 02:47:08.249]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[02:47:08.269 --> 02:47:12.072]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[02:47:12.092 --> 02:47:16.375]  I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you
[02:47:17.978 --> 02:47:27.481]  That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[02:47:28.622 --> 02:47:35.164]  To go now to infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[02:47:35.224 --> 02:47:39.565]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of this signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[02:47:40.486 --> 02:47:44.447]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[02:47:46.617 --> 02:47:50.099]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[02:47:50.159 --> 02:47:52.741]  But we will probably continue on.
[02:47:52.841 --> 02:47:53.882]  God's hand is on us.
[02:47:53.942 --> 02:47:54.762]  The force is with us.
[02:47:55.603 --> 02:47:56.803]  Please go now.
[02:47:57.063 --> 02:48:04.768]  It's in stock, ready to ship at infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:04.788 --> 02:48:07.930]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:48:08.050 --> 02:48:11.452]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[02:48:11.512 --> 02:48:13.854]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[02:48:16.564 --> 02:48:22.146]  2024.
[02:48:16.804 --> 02:48:22.146]  And I thank you for everything you do to support us.
[02:48:22.206 --> 02:48:23.607]  And this will be put in the warehouse.
[02:48:24.007 --> 02:48:26.388]  Somebody will get this book.
[02:48:26.928 --> 02:48:28.288]  Put a little something extra on there.
[02:48:28.308 --> 02:48:30.829]  All right.
[02:48:30.909 --> 02:48:33.030]  So, I appreciate you.
[02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:38.152]  Get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:48:39.637 --> 02:48:47.823]  Myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleibig, he'll put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut in jail.
[02:48:48.624 --> 02:48:50.425]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:50.445 --> 02:48:51.406]  We're betting on you.
[02:48:51.766 --> 02:48:52.867]  We believe on you.
[02:48:53.187 --> 02:48:55.028]  But we cannot do this without your support.
[02:48:55.448 --> 02:48:56.069]  Get a copy.
[02:48:56.089 --> 02:48:57.270]  Sign or unsign now.
[02:48:57.590 --> 02:49:00.432]  The last copies at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:49:00.452 --> 02:49:02.594]  And I humbly thank you all for your support.
[02:49:02.654 --> 02:49:03.935]  Now, please take action.
[02:49:07.719 --> 02:49:10.580]  All right, final segment ahead of Drew Hernandez taking over.
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:12.400]  Powerful last hour.
[02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:16.961]  Look, I'd rather cover news.
[02:49:17.481 --> 02:49:19.581]  I'd rather not sit up here and beg for support.
[02:49:20.882 --> 02:49:27.483]  I've been here for 30 years and, you know, we've been really huge for 25 and gigantic for 10.
[02:49:28.423 --> 02:49:30.203]  And people just expect we'll always be here.
[02:49:31.104 --> 02:49:32.584]  I think it's gonna be pretty spectacular.
[02:49:34.465 --> 02:49:36.246]  They're able to shut us down in the next few months.
[02:49:36.946 --> 02:49:40.567]  People are gonna be like, oh gosh, Alex Jones is shut down and the show will explode, but they don't care about that.
[02:49:41.308 --> 02:49:45.169]  They want the Infowars history.
[02:49:45.209 --> 02:49:47.270]  They want the show.
[02:49:47.290 --> 02:49:48.931]  They want the interviews.
[02:49:48.971 --> 02:49:50.171]  They want all that to claim.
[02:49:50.191 --> 02:49:52.152]  They own that in this bankruptcy.
[02:49:52.672 --> 02:49:57.854]  Try to shut down that brain trust that is... I mean, I could quit today.
[02:49:59.715 --> 02:50:02.976]  And that brain trust of interviews and predictions
[02:50:04.431 --> 02:50:05.212]  Fight's on forever.
[02:50:05.852 --> 02:50:08.934]  But if they can claim ownership of it, they can have AI expunge it, and that's their plan.
[02:50:10.876 --> 02:50:15.099]  So download all the shows off Band.Video and PrisonPlanet.TV and save them.
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:18.342]  And they're all free to air and the enemy doesn't own them.
[02:50:19.703 --> 02:50:23.045]  But we can beat these folks together.
[02:50:24.927 --> 02:50:27.649]  But if I don't have the financial support to keep fighting, we can't do it.
[02:50:29.010 --> 02:50:30.431]  So, make the decision.
[02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:33.355]  I just want to stay in the fight.
[02:50:34.015 --> 02:50:36.856]  I try to sell you great products so you'll get them and love them and keep using them.
[02:50:38.257 --> 02:50:39.817]  Go to DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:50:40.237 --> 02:50:42.158]  Incredible supplements, incredible products.
[02:50:42.838 --> 02:50:54.821]  The Next Level Fundational Energy, the Whole Food Multivitamins, the highest quality, the Cabochill, the Rocket Rest, the Top Brain Nootropic, the Nano Silver products.
[02:50:55.241 --> 02:50:56.542]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:50:57.282 --> 02:50:57.602]  Simple.
[02:50:57.642 --> 02:50:58.282]  Make the decision.
[02:50:58.302 --> 02:50:59.042]  Support the broadcast.
[02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:01.563]  And then you've got InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:51:03.186 --> 02:51:05.968]  Could be the last X2, X3 we'll ever have, they shut us down.
[02:51:06.608 --> 02:51:13.093]  The DNA Force, the Ultra 12, highest quality, rated B12, out of the tongue, full absorption, so good for you.
[02:51:13.613 --> 02:51:18.357]  The Nitric Boost, it cleans out your blood and cardiovascular system.
[02:51:18.377 --> 02:51:20.318]  I heard Dr. McGill was talking about how amazing it is.
[02:51:20.759 --> 02:51:21.699]  It's all there discounted.
[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:23.901]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:51:25.598 --> 02:51:26.499]  I can't do this without you.
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:30.565]  I can't fight without the resources for this infrastructure and to hold off the enemy.
[02:51:30.966 --> 02:51:33.309]  And we're having our biggest successes ever right now.
[02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:35.252]  And that's why they're so enraged.
[02:51:35.733 --> 02:51:37.015]  The Satanists are so pissed.
[02:51:37.676 --> 02:51:39.098]  And it's all in God's plan.
[02:51:39.158 --> 02:51:40.520]  Whatever happens is God's plan.
[02:51:41.020 --> 02:51:41.882]  I'm just going to keep fighting.
[02:51:43.604 --> 02:51:49.467]  And God will decide what to do, whether we survive or not, but God works through you to decide whether we survive or not.
[02:51:49.507 --> 02:51:55.830]  So please, go to infowarestore.com and get products that will enrich and power your life.
[02:51:56.690 --> 02:52:00.432]  Go to drjonesnackles.com and get products that will also enrich your life.
[02:52:00.972 --> 02:52:03.093]  Now, make that decision.
[02:52:04.734 --> 02:52:06.715]  Get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt.
[02:52:07.095 --> 02:52:08.836]  It takes money to fight these bastards.
[02:52:10.897 --> 02:52:11.517]  I have no fear.
[02:52:13.081 --> 02:52:13.881]  Other than failure.
[02:52:14.621 --> 02:52:17.242]  And I am in your hands, literally.
[02:52:17.642 --> 02:52:21.283]  And I'm asking you to stand with us, because you're in our hands as well.
[02:52:21.683 --> 02:52:23.264]  Together, we decide our destiny.
[02:52:24.924 --> 02:52:26.205]  Your Hernandez is set to take over.
[02:52:28.085 --> 02:52:28.865]  I appreciate the crew.
[02:52:29.666 --> 02:52:30.766]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:52:31.426 --> 02:52:33.287]  We got two months to three months left.
[02:52:34.467 --> 02:52:37.488]  And I got a lot of inside baseball to expose the next week or so.
[02:52:38.964 --> 02:52:39.884]  It's insane.
[02:52:39.904 --> 02:52:41.084]  We're up against the CIA.
[02:52:41.104 --> 02:52:43.025]  We're up against the Justice Department.
[02:52:43.845 --> 02:52:44.785]  But we got God on our side.
[02:52:45.865 --> 02:52:47.546]  And if God be with us, who can be against us?
[02:52:47.586 --> 02:52:49.706]  So, I got total faith in God.
[02:52:49.726 --> 02:52:51.326]  Whatever happens to me, it's part of God's plan.
[02:52:51.846 --> 02:53:01.128]  I'm just gonna fight, and tell the truth, and be as good as I possibly can be as a failed creature, and I'm gonna leave it all with God.
[02:53:02.148 --> 02:53:03.769]  Leave it all on the field.
[02:53:04.829 --> 02:53:05.649]  I'm doing everything I can.
[02:53:07.165 --> 02:53:08.646]  I'm not backing down one centimeter.
[02:53:09.626 --> 02:53:10.707]  I'm going over the top.
[02:53:11.547 --> 02:53:12.948]  But I can't do it without your support.
[02:53:13.468 --> 02:53:14.708]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:53:16.529 --> 02:53:17.790]  DrJonesDaggles.com.
[02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:19.210]  Go there now.
[02:53:19.711 --> 02:53:20.631]  Support the sponsors.
[02:53:20.711 --> 02:53:21.651]  And I thank you all.
[02:53:22.052 --> 02:53:26.033]  Because those of you that did support that 1%, you're the reason we did all this.
[02:53:26.113 --> 02:53:29.295]  So, I salute you and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:53:29.955 --> 02:53:33.377]  And I thank the crew and everybody else for the work they've done.
[02:53:33.397 --> 02:53:36.238]  I am so humble and so thankful to all of you.
[02:53:37.546 --> 02:53:43.092]  All right, I'm going to hand the baton to the great Drew Hernandez, who takes over in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:53:43.953 --> 02:53:44.614]  Wants to go to break.
[02:53:45.215 --> 02:53:46.716]  And for now, X is open and free.
[02:53:47.097 --> 02:53:50.640]  Follow me at Relox Jones on X. All righty, InfoWarriors.
[02:53:51.952 --> 02:53:54.554]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:54.674 --> 02:53:57.455]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.

[02:54:07.922 --> 02:54:09.143]  Band.Video, you guys know the links.
[02:54:09.163 --> 02:54:10.444]  Push them, push them, push them.
[02:54:10.504 --> 02:54:13.686]  Now, listen, one thing I will say is this.
[02:54:14.866 --> 02:54:19.009]  One thing I will say is this, is that when you take a look at the Bible,
[02:54:20.077 --> 02:54:25.218]  And you see what the Bible has to say about the last days that we are currently experiencing right now.
[02:54:26.138 --> 02:54:30.919]  And a lot of people ask themselves, well, what are the last days?
[02:54:31.959 --> 02:54:35.120]  And then they'll ask themselves, when are the last days?
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:37.621]  Is that something that we're looking forward to?
[02:54:37.641 --> 02:54:41.761]  Is that something that is coming near?
[02:54:42.622 --> 02:54:44.202]  Or is that something that's pretty far out?
[02:54:45.310 --> 02:55:10.420]  Well, I think when you actually zero in on what the Bible is talking about when it comes to the last days and you have biblical eschatology exegeted properly right in front of you, that means you interpret what the Bible is saying and you pull out what the Bible is saying, not putting your own interpretation into the Bible, reading your own interpretation into the Bible.
[02:55:11.335 --> 02:55:16.159]  In just basic biblical hermeneutics, that's what we would call eisegesis.
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:35.535]  But when you take a look at the last days and you see multiple indications from Jesus to his disciples and the apostles indicating via Bible prophecy that has been transmitted on the Word, the written Word of God, you do see the last days.
[02:55:36.356 --> 02:55:39.899]  Now, we see the Tribulation, the Great Tribulation,
[02:55:40.825 --> 02:56:04.300]  We see, depending on who you ask, an interpretation in Ezekiel 37-38, the battle of Gog and Magog, and a lot of Bible teachers right now have their eyes obviously on Israel, Russia's role, and the surrounding Middle East to see if that becomes a reality, if that's the correct interpretation.
[02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:09.424]  And a lot of Bible teachers believe that that is a prophetic event,
[02:56:10.646 --> 02:56:21.391]  Because there are some divine interventions that God performs that world history has not seen before.
[02:56:22.351 --> 02:56:34.256]  But in terms of the last days, and when you take a look just exactly at the world around you, and if you want a pretty basic definition, I mean, if you just take a look at the life of Jesus,
[02:56:35.129 --> 02:56:35.409]  Right?
[02:56:35.729 --> 02:56:54.296]  I mean you just look at the Apostle Paul when he tells his protege Timothy that the Holy Spirit explicitly, that means he announces with urgency, the world needs to know this, that in the last days the Holy Spirit explicitly says, declares, that in the last days many will depart from the faith.
[02:56:55.296 --> 02:57:03.099]  That's apostasy, taking heed to deceiving spirits, that's demonic spirits, fallen angels, those that are in
[02:57:03.954 --> 02:57:09.195]  Allegiance and have pledged their loyalty to Lucifer, Satan, the devil himself.
[02:57:10.075 --> 02:57:21.037]  And that comes through political ideology, that comes through religious ideologies that are false, that comes through cultural trends, that comes through all of humanity.
[02:57:21.057 --> 02:57:22.977]  It can come through the science community.
[02:57:23.978 --> 02:57:31.779]  Occult has been practiced in human history through the science community, interfacing with entities to receive higher knowledge, to understand the
[02:57:32.549 --> 02:57:39.051]  The universe and decode the universe to access a higher technology and understanding plane in our minds.
[02:57:39.331 --> 02:57:42.592]  This was a huge phenomenon, especially post World War Two.
[02:57:43.312 --> 02:57:51.735]  Just ask the CIA and why MKUltra was such a huge interest of the US government.
[02:57:52.755 --> 02:57:54.496]  Because the Nazis were totally into the occult.
[02:57:54.756 --> 02:57:56.196]  That's just a historical fact.
[02:57:57.177 --> 02:57:58.597]  But when you take a look at
[02:58:00.189 --> 02:58:18.384]  This throughout human history, you see the occult, this thread, all the way tied back to Lucifer himself, all the way tied back to his fall from heaven, because he viewed himself to be above God, to be God, to ascend above the stars, above the throne of God himself.
[02:58:19.505 --> 02:58:21.166]  That's the origin of the occult.
[02:58:21.747 --> 02:58:22.427]  It starts with him.
[02:58:22.447 --> 02:58:24.129]  You see that in the garden?
[02:58:25.276 --> 02:58:41.686]  You see the occult fully operational, offering a higher wisdom, a higher thinking, that is forbidden, that God apparently doesn't want you to have, that was offered directly in the Garden of Eden to Eve herself, and her cucked out husband Adam just went with it.
[02:58:43.027 --> 02:58:49.311]  So you see the occult right there, with an offering of a higher wisdom, an enlightened wisdom.
[02:58:50.103 --> 02:58:52.325]  You wanna know when you're dealing with the occult?
[02:58:52.885 --> 02:58:54.946]  You wanna know when you're dealing with a cult?
[02:58:55.647 --> 02:59:02.612]  Is whenever you have not just a religious entity or a religious movement, could be anything.
[02:59:03.472 --> 02:59:11.978]  Could be political, could be scientific, could be medical, could be cultural in any way, shape, or form through music or movies or the arts.
[02:59:12.819 --> 02:59:14.320]  A cult could be formed out of anything.
[02:59:15.074 --> 02:59:26.241]  But one identifying factor that you know you are dealing with the occult or dealing with a cult is they will always use the same playbook that Lucifer himself used from the very beginning.
[02:59:26.361 --> 02:59:36.987]  And that's to offer humanity a higher wisdom or a forbidden higher plane of thinking intellectually.
[02:59:37.007 --> 02:59:42.891]  And I think right now, as we live in the 21st century, I think mankind is kind of viewing that as an advanced
[02:59:43.944 --> 03:00:01.157]  uh ability in technology and see this is where when you take a look at human history especially in the days of Jesus those that were interfacing via witchcraft mediums spiritists even see this with uh Daniel when he's dealing with King Nebuchadnezzar
[03:00:02.251 --> 03:00:06.054]  He's having crazy dreams, and he's trying to figure out, what do these dreams mean?
[03:00:06.114 --> 03:00:06.894]  Who do I go to?
[03:00:06.954 --> 03:00:07.775]  Who do I go to?
[03:00:08.095 --> 03:00:09.736]  Who are the intellectuals of the day?
[03:00:09.756 --> 03:00:20.263]  Well, those that interpret dreams, the mediums, the spiritists, those that interface with entities that give us higher thinking, which equates to higher learning.
[03:00:20.824 --> 03:00:31.111]  See, throughout human history, interfacing with demonic beings translates either to higher intellectual thought leaders of that generation,
[03:00:32.318 --> 03:00:33.829]  Or, I think where we are right now...
[03:00:34.682 --> 03:00:43.408]  Those that are interfacing with the occult and these fallen angels and they're having conversations, they're receiving downloads from them as well.
[03:00:43.528 --> 03:00:46.410]  I think it's viewed today as, yes, a higher wisdom.
[03:00:46.911 --> 03:00:58.459]  But at the same time, I think it's blended with an interpretation that, OK, well, these beings have the wisdom to hand humanity a higher, more advanced technology.
[03:00:58.479 --> 03:01:01.401]  And I personally believe that's how we're going to get to the mark of the beast.
[03:01:01.441 --> 03:01:02.902]  It's like this marriage.
[03:01:03.522 --> 03:01:06.345]  Between demonic wisdom, which, by the way, the Bible does talk about.
[03:01:06.925 --> 03:01:11.169]  There's human wisdom, there's God's wisdom, and there is demonic wisdom.
[03:01:11.209 --> 03:01:12.350]  You find that in the book of James.
[03:01:12.390 --> 03:01:14.192]  It's very clear, right out in the open.
[03:01:15.313 --> 03:01:29.345]  And so, yes, demonic beings can pass their wisdom, and that's whatever that they want humans to know to manipulate them for the purposes and the agenda of Lucifer in the kingdom of darkness.
[03:01:30.188 --> 03:01:35.692]  The ultimate endgame is to destroy the soul and plunge them into eternal damnation without God forever.
[03:01:35.712 --> 03:01:38.513]  That's their agenda.
[03:01:39.714 --> 03:01:43.516]  But I think mankind right now does find itself, and this is where people have to be very careful.
[03:01:43.597 --> 03:01:45.097]  I'm not anti-technology.
[03:01:45.818 --> 03:01:46.819]  I love technology.
[03:01:46.979 --> 03:01:48.760]  I'm a millennial.
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:52.142]  I was introduced to the Internet as a child.
[03:01:52.902 --> 03:01:54.183]  We experienced that.
[03:01:54.844 --> 03:01:58.466]  I think we're the last generation to know what the world was like without
[03:01:59.491 --> 03:02:00.051]  The internet.
[03:02:01.192 --> 03:02:02.953]  And now we've been given the internet.
[03:02:03.013 --> 03:02:05.174]  So I, you know, I love technology.
[03:02:05.194 --> 03:02:07.555]  I'm not opposed to it.
[03:02:08.196 --> 03:02:27.886]  However, I will say that if you're going to sit here and be naive and think that Lucifer himself doesn't have an agenda or a plan to deceive the nations via technology by playing on their desires for more advanced technology and playing on their lusts through power.
[03:02:29.076 --> 03:02:40.842]  And to advance intellectually via technology, especially with now that it is 100% a reality that humans can merge with machines via neurotechnology.
[03:02:42.142 --> 03:02:44.524]  That is 100% a reality as I speak.
[03:02:45.344 --> 03:02:50.026]  And you bring AI into that, machine learning, and you take a look at where the future is going.
[03:02:50.046 --> 03:02:55.329]  Because I'll tell you one thing, the US government and their capabilities with artificial intelligence
[03:02:56.949 --> 03:03:06.354]  It is far beyond far beyond what the current population can even comprehend, especially even China and their advanced abilities.
[03:03:06.975 --> 03:03:11.137]  They're just not going to release what they know when they knew it, how they knew it.
[03:03:12.017 --> 03:03:13.158]  It's all about timing.
[03:03:13.898 --> 03:03:14.799]  And we've known this, right?
[03:03:14.839 --> 03:03:16.079]  We've known this, right?
[03:03:16.099 --> 03:03:19.101]  We've known that, you know, our U.S., our own government,
[03:03:20.012 --> 03:03:27.896]  The DoD and, you know, national security and there's classified and there's all these black projects and deep black projects.
[03:03:27.936 --> 03:03:36.039]  And it's all about harnessing and protecting and keeping secret our technology for the military industrial complex.
[03:03:36.279 --> 03:03:37.300]  So the excuses.
[03:03:37.380 --> 03:03:40.741]  So our foreign enemies can't grab a hold of that and use it against us.
[03:03:40.781 --> 03:03:44.143]  So we remain the supreme superpower on planet Earth.
[03:03:44.663 --> 03:03:50.351]  And that's the argument to keep it from the American people because the American people can't be trusted because they might be a Russian.
[03:03:50.631 --> 03:03:52.173]  We've been hearing that since the Cold War.
[03:03:53.215 --> 03:04:01.165]  And so when you take a look at this and you see just exactly the way and the pattern and the absolute
[03:04:02.003 --> 03:04:02.644]  Isn't it crazy?
[03:04:17.515 --> 03:04:29.045]  Honestly, isn't it wild that the same people that are obsessed with evolution and the evolution of human beings seems to believe in everything that goes against God that actually takes humanity backwards?
[03:04:29.105 --> 03:04:30.506]  It's the opposite of progression.
[03:04:30.847 --> 03:04:44.899]  Wow, homosexuality and dudes banging dudes and women banging women is definitely going to lead us into a progressive society where we are repopulating, not spreading AIDS and disease, where we're going backwards and everybody's dying as a result.
[03:04:45.499 --> 03:04:45.919]  Wow!
[03:04:46.059 --> 03:04:51.582]  Definitely believing in chopping the genitals off, not just children, but chopping the genitals off of adults.
[03:04:51.902 --> 03:04:54.383]  That's definitely gonna take us into the future.
[03:04:54.483 --> 03:05:00.665]  It's all satanic, baphomet, depopulation, anti-God ideology.
[03:05:02.466 --> 03:05:04.447]  Guess what Vivek Ramaswamy said the other day?
[03:05:05.207 --> 03:05:05.987]  Satanic, dude.
[03:05:06.048 --> 03:05:07.368]  Straight from the mouth of the serpent.
[03:05:07.928 --> 03:05:08.388]  But look at it.
[03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:10.529]  It might be still his pinned tweet right now.
[03:05:11.290 --> 03:05:12.290]  And I fully condemn it.
[03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:14.311]  Vivek comes out and says, hey,
[03:05:15.054 --> 03:05:19.115]  This is what the media doesn't want you to know is a message from the GOP.
[03:05:19.695 --> 03:05:20.716]  You want to be gay?
[03:05:20.916 --> 03:05:22.256]  You want to be a homosexual?
[03:05:22.656 --> 03:05:25.697]  You can marry whoever you want, when you want, if you want.
[03:05:26.077 --> 03:05:29.498]  That is 100% anti-Christ.
[03:05:30.258 --> 03:05:31.839]  I'm not saying he is the anti-Christ.
[03:05:31.879 --> 03:05:34.259]  That is anti-God, anti-Bible.
[03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:38.580]  God doesn't even identify gay marriage.
[03:05:39.981 --> 03:05:42.601]  Not only does God not support it, He doesn't even acknowledge it.
[03:05:42.622 --> 03:05:44.122]  Because it doesn't exist.
[03:05:44.975 --> 03:05:49.143]  It doesn't exist in God's psyche, in his mind, in his eternality.
[03:05:51.189 --> 03:06:04.374]  So anyone that's trying to tell you and tell an entire generation, especially a lot of Gen Z, young so-called right-wingers follow people like Vivek Ramaswamy, telling you, literally, a blasphemy and an abomination declared by God.
[03:06:04.394 --> 03:06:05.615]  Yeah, you want to be gay?
[03:06:05.635 --> 03:06:07.116]  The GOP doesn't want you to know this.
[03:06:07.236 --> 03:06:08.036]  You could be gay.
[03:06:08.236 --> 03:06:09.957]  You could marry who you want, if you want.
[03:06:10.017 --> 03:06:11.617]  And it's totally left open and vague.
[03:06:11.637 --> 03:06:12.658]  It's like, really, Vivek?
[03:06:12.818 --> 03:06:15.619]  You could be a homosexual and marry whoever you want?
[03:06:15.679 --> 03:06:17.760]  What, I could marry a horse and sodomize a horse?
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:19.900]  Oh, that sounds really degenerate.
[03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:31.223]  Yeah, because you're dealing with perverts and you're teaching an entire generation it's okay to go against God directly via an abomination, leading people to their destruction and their eternal death.
[03:06:31.903 --> 03:06:33.403]  Yeah, I take this very seriously.
[03:06:33.423 --> 03:06:34.824]  Want to know why?
[03:06:34.944 --> 03:06:37.704]  Because I'm a born-again Christian that believes in the Bible.
[03:06:37.964 --> 03:06:41.365]  I stand with God before I stand with the United States of America.
[03:06:41.585 --> 03:06:45.946]  And if that offends you, well, welcome to the supremacy of Jesus Christ, okay?
[03:06:48.325 --> 03:06:51.147]  And you know, you'll get called alt-right for that.
[03:06:52.307 --> 03:06:55.429]  You'll get called far-right, not by the left, for talking like this.
[03:06:56.350 --> 03:06:58.551]  You'll get called this by the current GOP.
[03:06:59.412 --> 03:07:05.696]  Even some so-called Trump supporters that think they're Christians that can't wrap their mind around opposing homosexuality.
[03:07:05.716 --> 03:07:09.618]  You either stand with God or you stand with Jesus Christ.
[03:07:09.658 --> 03:07:12.420]  And by the way, can we name who this God is?
[03:07:13.420 --> 03:07:15.502]  By the way, can we name who this God is?
[03:07:16.932 --> 03:07:19.253]  Can President Trump name who this God is?
[03:07:19.273 --> 03:07:34.021]  Because I believe this prophecy, that this led him to a born-again conversion, when Jesus Christ is on the lips of Donald J. Trump and he's preaching the gospel with his newfound born-again life, apparently.
[03:07:34.241 --> 03:07:36.042]  And I know some people go through a process.
[03:07:36.762 --> 03:07:41.725]  Not everybody has this radical transformation where they're immediately preaching off of the rooftops.
[03:07:42.822 --> 03:07:46.964]  But I will say this, is that the Bible is very clear when it comes to prophecy.
[03:07:47.044 --> 03:07:48.004]  I'll say two things.
[03:07:48.665 --> 03:07:50.725]  The Bible says to test prophecies.
[03:07:52.066 --> 03:08:03.131]  The Bible also says when it comes to men or individuals that claim to be prophets and speaking on behalf of God, that they better get it 100% right.
[03:08:03.191 --> 03:08:03.771]  And if they don't,
[03:08:06.514 --> 03:08:11.316]  If what they say does not come to pass, and it's perfection, perfection!
[03:08:11.356 --> 03:08:12.477]  God doesn't make mistakes.
[03:08:13.777 --> 03:08:19.740]  When God prophesies, all of the prophets in the Bible, not a single one of them got it wrong.
[03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:21.841]  Not a single one of them got it 95%, right?
[03:08:21.861 --> 03:08:22.701]  Not a single one of them got it 96%, 97, 98, 99.9!
[03:08:22.861 --> 03:08:25.002]  I challenge you, every single prophet that God has called
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:37.160]  In the Bible?
[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:38.901]  Let's just pick on the Bible.
[03:08:39.221 --> 03:08:41.562]  Got it.
[03:08:41.582 --> 03:08:42.442]  100% correct.
[03:08:42.902 --> 03:08:43.903]  No human error.
[03:08:44.363 --> 03:08:46.343]  No human misinterpretation.
[03:08:46.363 --> 03:08:47.944]  100% correct.
[03:08:47.964 --> 03:08:55.146]  Because the Apostle Peter comes in the New Testament and says, the prophets of old, they were moved by the Holy Spirit of God.
[03:08:55.166 --> 03:08:56.907]  It was God speaking.
[03:08:58.207 --> 03:08:59.968]  It was God that inspired these people.
[03:09:01.168 --> 03:09:03.349]  And when God is speaking, God doesn't make mistakes.
[03:09:04.019 --> 03:09:06.481]  Because then you'll get people that will say, well, there's the human error.
[03:09:06.501 --> 03:09:07.502]  There's the human factor.
[03:09:07.842 --> 03:09:13.626]  Again, take a look at humans that were called by God, that prophesied in the scripture.
[03:09:14.007 --> 03:09:15.988]  They got it 100% right.
[03:09:16.949 --> 03:09:18.070]  Because it was real.
[03:09:19.091 --> 03:09:20.051]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:09:20.332 --> 03:09:24.275]  And by the way, false prophets were to be stoned if they got it wrong.
[03:09:25.656 --> 03:09:28.678]  So, yeah, there's that.
[03:09:28.758 --> 03:09:29.619]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:09:32.921 --> 03:09:33.642]  All this to say,
[03:09:34.688 --> 03:09:41.415]  Because when we're having this conversation about the last days, there are indications that you are in the last days.
[03:09:42.196 --> 03:09:47.141]  And I'll get back to why what Vivek says is a total abomination.
[03:09:47.862 --> 03:09:49.784]  Why is the GOP always doing this?
[03:09:49.864 --> 03:09:50.565]  I don't understand.
[03:09:52.294 --> 03:09:52.794]  I don't get it.
[03:09:52.894 --> 03:10:03.558]  Why does the GOP want to just cater and pander to homosexuals that are such a small percentage of the population in the United States of America?
[03:10:03.658 --> 03:10:04.438]  I don't understand it.
[03:10:05.018 --> 03:10:07.379]  To me, you want to know what that is to me?
[03:10:07.399 --> 03:10:12.260]  I'm going to be completely honest with you, and I could care less if you're offended by this, honestly, if you could tell.
[03:10:13.221 --> 03:10:20.283]  When I see the GOP or even Trump supporters, when I see these people and are these right-wingers,
[03:10:21.307 --> 03:10:28.391]  On stage, just shilling and pandering to homosexuals, right?
[03:10:29.032 --> 03:10:42.099]  To me, it's the equivalent of watching Kamala Harris stand on a stage in Atlanta in front of a bunch of black people and start changing her accent as if she's one of them.
[03:10:42.139 --> 03:10:44.321]  And all of a sudden, she's talking ghetto.
[03:10:44.981 --> 03:10:54.692]  It's the equivalent to me of watching Hillary Clinton show up to a black church and then all of a sudden she has some kind of southern accent when she's talking to blacks.
[03:10:55.052 --> 03:10:55.813]  It's cringe.
[03:10:56.253 --> 03:10:56.894]  It's gay.
[03:10:56.914 --> 03:10:57.955]  It's fake.
[03:10:58.296 --> 03:10:59.036]  And it's retarded.
[03:10:59.297 --> 03:11:00.118]  And I'll say this.
[03:11:01.346 --> 03:11:20.598]  I don't like it more when the GOP does this, because these are the same people that run around claiming that we're a Judeo-Christian nation, and we're a nation founded off of God and the Bible, and we are hated because we have some kind of moral principles.
[03:11:20.618 --> 03:11:22.799]  You know what?
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:30.764]  If the GOP doesn't want to stand with God, if the GOP doesn't want to stand with the Bible,
[03:11:32.259 --> 03:11:37.264]  Then I would advise the GOP to get Christ's name out of your mouth.
[03:11:38.405 --> 03:11:50.195]  Stop attempting to deceive the rest of us out here and slapping Christians in the face, because we know God's Word and we know a fraud when we see one, because we've been taught by the Holy Scriptures.
[03:11:50.215 --> 03:11:52.017]  You want to talk about discerning false prophets?
[03:11:52.677 --> 03:11:55.380]  Jesus made it very clear, you shall know them by their fruit.
[03:11:56.312 --> 03:12:00.914]  A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit.
[03:12:01.454 --> 03:12:03.135]  You shall know them by their fruit.
[03:12:05.596 --> 03:12:13.139]  And one thing I will say, because this is, and I'll say this too, because this current generation of the GOP, right?
[03:12:13.945 --> 03:12:16.407]  That are like shilling for gays and homosexuals.
[03:12:16.727 --> 03:12:19.569]  It's the most retarded fake and gay thing I've ever seen.
[03:12:19.589 --> 03:12:20.029]  I'm like, why?
[03:12:20.109 --> 03:12:20.269]  Why?
[03:12:20.329 --> 03:12:21.170]  What is the point of this?
[03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:26.974]  Why do you just put up a middle finger to your entire, entire evangelical base?
[03:12:27.194 --> 03:12:31.037]  There are more of us than there are of these sodomites in the United States of America.
[03:12:31.317 --> 03:12:31.797]  Do the math.
[03:12:31.837 --> 03:12:32.858]  It doesn't make any sense.
[03:12:33.158 --> 03:12:34.419]  Who are you trying to please?
[03:12:34.439 --> 03:12:35.620]  You know what you're doing?
[03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:37.641]  You're serving your father, the devil.
[03:12:37.702 --> 03:12:38.482]  That's what you're doing.
[03:12:38.882 --> 03:12:42.485]  You're homophobic because you're afraid of hurting a gay person's feelings.
[03:12:43.314 --> 03:12:50.156]  You're afraid of standing with the Lord Jesus Christ and his eternal word that clearly, clearly opposes homosexuality.
[03:12:50.676 --> 03:12:57.838]  And then at the same time, you got his name in your mouth, trying to waltz around like you stand for God in the United States of America.
[03:12:57.858 --> 03:12:58.498]  You're a fraud.
[03:12:58.738 --> 03:12:59.699]  You're a false prophet.
[03:12:59.899 --> 03:13:05.040]  Our Bible exposes you and pulls that mask right off your face for the wolf you truly are.
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:08.421]  Yeah, take that as a rebuke to the entire GOP that's doing this.
[03:13:08.661 --> 03:13:15.486]  And people within MAGA that want to shill for homosexuals because they don't want to be mean to the gay guy that's got a MAGA hat on.
[03:13:18.689 --> 03:13:19.109]  Please.
[03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:23.593]  This is why America is continuing to fail.
[03:13:23.713 --> 03:13:26.014]  This is why America is continuing to deteriorate.
[03:13:26.335 --> 03:13:34.481]  Because we can't take a stance for something as basic as traditional God-assigned and authored marriage for humanity?
[03:13:36.235 --> 03:13:38.898]  You want to talk about the government not getting involved in marriage?
[03:13:39.398 --> 03:13:43.683]  Because this current GOP is all cucked out and their entire talking points are always this.
[03:13:43.983 --> 03:13:47.426]  Well, the government's not going to get in the way with who you want to marry.
[03:13:47.607 --> 03:13:50.209]  Why doesn't the GOP just come out and admit it?
[03:13:50.449 --> 03:13:52.031]  You guys are liberal.
[03:13:52.291 --> 03:13:54.233]  You guys are no different than the left.
[03:13:54.493 --> 03:13:55.775]  And you guys are
[03:13:56.195 --> 03:14:00.536]  Floating way more further left and you don't want anything to do with God's Word.
[03:14:00.736 --> 03:14:02.977]  You don't want anything to do with any real morality.
[03:14:03.197 --> 03:14:07.598]  You are just simply a fraud and you are a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:14:07.958 --> 03:14:23.102]  Social liberals waltzing around as fiscal conservatives lecturing real right-wingers like myself and millions of others out there that we're the problem because we actually have biblical morals and values.
[03:14:25.603 --> 03:14:26.903]  That's called subversion.
[03:14:27.244 --> 03:14:27.884]  That's what that is.
[03:14:29.885 --> 03:14:31.525]  And that's called deception in my book.
[03:14:32.525 --> 03:14:33.446]  I'm not falling for it.
[03:14:33.466 --> 03:14:35.667]  I don't know about you, but I'm sick of it.
[03:14:35.707 --> 03:14:39.328]  I'm sick of these people running around with Christ's name in their mouth.
[03:14:40.503 --> 03:14:42.384]  And they have the worst principles ever.
[03:14:42.424 --> 03:14:43.024]  They have the worst.
[03:14:43.104 --> 03:14:45.706]  It's like, no, you want to talk about the government not getting involved?
[03:14:45.986 --> 03:14:47.907]  The biblical perspective on marriage?
[03:14:48.187 --> 03:14:51.369]  The government has no say, no ability.
[03:14:51.809 --> 03:14:58.713]  Human beings do not have in any way, shape or form the ability to define what marriage is.
[03:14:58.973 --> 03:15:00.274]  That comes from God.
[03:15:01.034 --> 03:15:07.138]  No government, no politician, no dictator, no regime, nobody, no shill.
[03:15:08.254 --> 03:15:09.135]  Not even the church.
[03:15:09.795 --> 03:15:11.497]  The church doesn't have that ability.
[03:15:12.518 --> 03:15:16.121]  I don't have the authority as a born-again Christian to define marriage.
[03:15:16.981 --> 03:15:21.585]  I transmit the message of the architect that has defined marriage.
[03:15:21.905 --> 03:15:22.506]  That's him.
[03:15:23.146 --> 03:15:24.507]  I'm just a mouthpiece, dude.
[03:15:24.988 --> 03:15:27.149]  And I'm not saying that because I'm like, oh, don't shoot the messenger.
[03:15:27.370 --> 03:15:28.591]  No, come on, shoot the messenger!
[03:15:29.631 --> 03:15:31.153]  We're willing to die for this message!
[03:15:33.314 --> 03:15:34.135]  People have bled.
[03:15:34.655 --> 03:15:36.376]  People have given their lives.
[03:15:36.396 --> 03:15:37.117]  You don't understand.
[03:15:37.137 --> 03:15:45.502]  Like, when you take a look at church history, you don't understand that Christians have been persecuted for simple doctrines such as the supremacy of Jesus Christ in the church.
[03:15:46.623 --> 03:15:47.183]  You don't understand.
[03:15:47.203 --> 03:15:58.710]  People have had their slits decapitated, their families hunted for doctrines as basic as the supremacy of Jesus in the church.
[03:15:58.750 --> 03:15:59.711]  He's the head of the church.
[03:16:02.173 --> 03:16:05.456]  Like, where are we now in the United States of America as a church?
[03:16:07.298 --> 03:16:16.326]  The point is, in church history, Christians have been willing to lose their heads for this gospel and doctrines within the Bible.
[03:16:17.267 --> 03:16:21.011]  And right now, the United States of America can't take a stance.
[03:16:21.571 --> 03:16:25.295]  This Christian church in America
[03:16:26.090 --> 03:16:37.447]  is so weak and so cucked out that they can't find themselves to find the boldness or the courage to simply take a stand against gay marriage and a bunch of homosexuals with limp wrists?
[03:16:37.888 --> 03:16:38.709]  Give me a break.
[03:16:39.250 --> 03:16:39.830]  We're not ready.
[03:16:39.850 --> 03:16:41.232]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:41.733 --> 03:16:45.534]  When we came out with Nitric Boost three years ago, it was a sleeper product.
[03:16:45.554 --> 03:16:46.275]  I didn't even promote it.
[03:16:46.455 --> 03:16:52.877]  But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products because of the incredible results they get.
[03:16:53.057 --> 03:16:59.099]  If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean out and purify your blood,
[03:17:00.359 --> 03:17:02.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[03:17:02.661 --> 03:17:05.582]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[03:17:05.883 --> 03:17:07.704]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[03:17:07.764 --> 03:17:10.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does so many great things.
[03:17:11.086 --> 03:17:11.346]  Why?
[03:17:11.686 --> 03:17:14.168]  But you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:17:14.188 --> 03:17:16.029]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:17:16.349 --> 03:17:20.612]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably a... I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging.
[03:17:20.672 --> 03:17:21.432]  It's actually shameful.
[03:17:21.652 --> 03:17:23.233]  Probably 150 women or more.
[03:17:23.533 --> 03:17:24.154]  That's conservative.
[03:17:24.514 --> 03:17:26.215]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[03:17:26.255 --> 03:17:27.476]  It's great for women as well.

[03:18:40.784 --> 03:18:46.025]  But continuing this conversation about the last days.
[03:18:47.086 --> 03:18:50.647]  And so I go back to my point where the Bible is very clear.
[03:18:51.380 --> 03:19:06.706]  Where the Apostle Paul fairly clearly states to his protege Timothy that was about to embark on discipling a whole generation of pastors throughout the region he was called to.
[03:19:07.386 --> 03:19:18.671]  One of the things he makes very clear to him is that in the last days, the Holy Spirit explicitly says, declares from the rooftops, that many will depart from the faith.
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:21.100]  That's an apostasy.
[03:19:21.140 --> 03:19:26.622]  That's a divorcing of oneself from the faith, the Christian faith.
[03:19:28.703 --> 03:19:33.584]  That is the doctrines of the Bible, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[03:19:34.284 --> 03:19:36.545]  People will throw away biblical truth.
[03:19:36.765 --> 03:19:40.366]  They will divorce themselves from biblical truth.
[03:19:40.406 --> 03:19:43.147]  And that doesn't only come in the form of
[03:19:44.236 --> 03:19:51.860]  I'm a satanist now and I want a 666 tattoo because I'm a radical and I hate God.
[03:19:52.820 --> 03:20:00.644]  That comes in the form of someone like Vivek Ramaswamy telling an entire generation, hey, the GOP wants you to know, but the media doesn't want you to know.
[03:20:00.944 --> 03:20:05.247]  You can be gay, marry who you want, if you want, when you want, and the government's not going to get in the way.
[03:20:05.267 --> 03:20:07.768]  That is one way to destroy a civilization.
[03:20:07.788 --> 03:20:09.889]  That's satanic, my friend.
[03:20:09.929 --> 03:20:10.569]  Don't listen to that.
[03:20:11.210 --> 03:20:11.890]  Listen to God.
[03:20:12.597 --> 03:20:18.358]  Don't listen to Vivek telling you you could be a sodomite, destroy your life, catch AIDS and STDs and die early.
[03:20:18.378 --> 03:20:21.839]  Then we don't have a civilization anymore to repopulate.
[03:20:22.199 --> 03:20:23.920]  By the way, we will outlive these people.
[03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:26.760]  You can take heart in that fact.
[03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:39.123]  If you're discouraged, you're seeing this entire generation flip to just straight up sodomites, LGBTQ, psychobaphomet transhuman freaks cutting their genitals off.
[03:20:41.024 --> 03:20:42.124]  We will outlive these people.
[03:20:42.921 --> 03:20:43.381]  Pray for them.
[03:20:43.921 --> 03:20:45.122]  We want them to come to Christ.
[03:20:45.662 --> 03:20:48.802]  But do know, we will outlive this generation.
[03:20:50.163 --> 03:20:50.583]  We will.
[03:20:51.863 --> 03:20:52.943]  That is a fact.
[03:20:53.043 --> 03:20:54.044]  That's a fact.
[03:20:54.084 --> 03:20:55.164]  A scientific fact.
[03:20:55.704 --> 03:20:58.545]  These people do not have a long lifespan.
[03:20:58.925 --> 03:21:01.625]  And they don't have the ability to repopulate.
[03:21:02.986 --> 03:21:04.166]  So they're gonna die off early.
[03:21:05.286 --> 03:21:05.686]  Alright.
[03:21:07.067 --> 03:21:08.747]  We're gonna be in for a ride for a little bit.
[03:21:09.567 --> 03:21:12.508]  But I can assure you, we will outlive these people.
[03:21:14.307 --> 03:21:21.854]  And those that pledge allegiance to Lucifer, they will eventually see their demise if they don't repent eternally.
[03:21:22.854 --> 03:21:32.362]  But again, going back to the last days, and you see these biblical indications, I'd make the argument that the last days started 2,000 years ago.
[03:21:32.943 --> 03:21:41.170]  Now when you get specific and you zoom in, you have the Tribulation, you have the Great Tribulation, you see this First Second Thessalonians, the Book of Revelation, you see all of this
[03:21:42.020 --> 03:21:48.745]  Uh, unloading on humanity and it's God's wrath on mankind, but particularly Israel as well, by the way.
[03:21:48.805 --> 03:21:50.787]  That's the time of Jacob's trouble.
[03:21:51.487 --> 03:21:54.910]  That's God's wrath poured out on Israel.
[03:21:56.992 --> 03:22:01.895]  But I would argue that the last days, uh, initiated, uh, we haven't seen the tribulation.
[03:22:01.955 --> 03:22:03.697]  I don't believe we've seen the great tribulation.
[03:22:04.137 --> 03:22:10.622]  There are some precursors to that in order for those events to take place that you see in first and second Thessalonians.
[03:22:12.482 --> 03:22:14.504]  Other people have different eschatology on that.
[03:22:14.604 --> 03:22:15.125]  That's fine.
[03:22:15.465 --> 03:22:16.005]  This is mine.
[03:22:18.828 --> 03:22:22.951]  But I would argue that the last day started 2,000 years ago.
[03:22:24.332 --> 03:22:37.804]  And I would say that there were Bible prophecy, there were prophetic events that had to take place before what we would traditionally say what comes next.
[03:22:38.504 --> 03:22:39.125]  Some will say,
[03:22:40.325 --> 03:22:48.993]  After the ascension of Jesus and after the day of Pentecost, because that was foretold in the scriptures, right?
[03:22:49.853 --> 03:23:00.783]  And then also the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles and the ministry of the Gentiles, because we see in the Bible that the time of the Gentiles is coming to fulfillment.
[03:23:01.803 --> 03:23:06.007]  And we know that the Apostle Paul was a part of that prophecy.
[03:23:06.027 --> 03:23:06.888]  He even viewed himself
[03:23:07.731 --> 03:23:17.398]  As that prophecy as well as being unfolded, which is kind of ironic, because one of the most famous Jews, literally a Jewish terrorist, okay?
[03:23:17.418 --> 03:23:20.700]  The Apostle Paul that was hunting down and murdering Christians.
[03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:23.442]  I want to talk about a guy that is like the all-star.
[03:23:23.482 --> 03:23:24.543]  He even calls himself that.
[03:23:24.583 --> 03:23:26.424]  I'm like of the stock of Israel.
[03:23:26.504 --> 03:23:27.485]  I'm the top guy.
[03:23:27.585 --> 03:23:32.949]  I am the guy studied under the top Jews and Pharisees you could possibly think of.
[03:23:33.069 --> 03:23:34.510]  Nobody can beat me out.
[03:23:35.171 --> 03:23:38.613]  The Apostle Paul viewed himself as like the super Jew, dude, straight up.
[03:23:39.794 --> 03:23:40.474]  Go read the Bible.
[03:23:40.494 --> 03:23:41.575]  That's how he viewed himself.
[03:23:41.915 --> 03:23:44.597]  He's like, but I wasn't saved.
[03:23:45.257 --> 03:23:45.858]  I was a wretch.
[03:23:47.058 --> 03:23:47.859]  I was satanic.
[03:23:48.719 --> 03:23:50.681]  I was an instrument of Satan.
[03:23:50.741 --> 03:23:52.942]  Like, clearly he was being used in that way.
[03:23:53.002 --> 03:23:57.685]  And he became born again and rode to Damascus, had that experience.
[03:23:58.866 --> 03:24:02.348]  And even the current world around him, because he was famous,
[03:24:03.163 --> 03:24:05.184]  Didn't believe he was actually a born-again Christian.
[03:24:05.204 --> 03:24:08.026]  That was a problem in the first century church.
[03:24:08.046 --> 03:24:08.767]  They're like, why is this?
[03:24:08.847 --> 03:24:09.387]  Are you sure?
[03:24:09.407 --> 03:24:12.189]  Is this some kind of infiltration?
[03:24:12.209 --> 03:24:13.650]  Is this guy for real?
[03:24:13.710 --> 03:24:14.691]  Is he actually born again?
[03:24:14.711 --> 03:24:16.172]  Because this guy was just trying to kill us.
[03:24:17.693 --> 03:24:21.055]  And so, but that's just the power of the gospel, right?
[03:24:21.836 --> 03:24:23.257]  To truly change somebody like that.
[03:24:24.858 --> 03:24:27.219]  But he made it very clear.
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:29.521]  And you see that within the New Testament.
[03:24:29.561 --> 03:24:32.163]  And I would say that possibly the next
[03:24:33.366 --> 03:24:43.374]  Event prophetically that you would see on God's timeline is possibly an Ezekiel 3738 scenario if that's interpreted correctly and may or may not be.
[03:24:44.955 --> 03:24:45.996]  Possibly the rapture.
[03:24:46.436 --> 03:24:49.318]  I hold a pre-trib view of the rapture.
[03:24:49.398 --> 03:24:50.819]  Some people have a mid.
[03:24:50.899 --> 03:24:51.900]  Some people have a post.
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:52.901]  That's fine.
[03:24:53.641 --> 03:25:00.807]  I view this as a secondary issue that isn't required for salvation.
[03:25:02.792 --> 03:25:14.803]  But ultimately, in terms of the last days, this is the point that I wanted to make with people, and especially if you're not a Christian or you've never read the Bible, the last days is not something that we're looking toward.
[03:25:14.963 --> 03:25:17.546]  The last days started 2,000 years ago.
[03:25:18.406 --> 03:25:27.615]  Because if we are living in the time of the Gentiles, if you look at God's timeline and his prophetic clock, when you see Bible prophecy, you see the day of Pentecost.
[03:25:28.582 --> 03:25:30.724]  And then you see the time of the Gentiles.
[03:25:30.864 --> 03:25:31.905]  That's been foretold.
[03:25:31.945 --> 03:25:35.648]  And God turns His attention because of the rejection of Israel.
[03:25:35.688 --> 03:25:36.949]  God turns His attention.
[03:25:36.969 --> 03:25:39.952]  He begins to pour out His Holy Spirit to the Gentiles.
[03:25:40.932 --> 03:25:44.916]  And that's currently happening right now as I speak.
[03:25:46.057 --> 03:25:57.286]  And by the way, the current Jews of the day, because of their ridiculously self-righteous religious mindset, they couldn't comprehend that God could or would do something like that.
[03:25:58.106 --> 03:26:07.809]  See, it's in Acts chapter 15, where they have this massive council to decide whether or not the dirty goy can come to Jesus or not.
[03:26:08.109 --> 03:26:08.569]  Straight up!
[03:26:08.829 --> 03:26:12.070]  Yeah, this has been going on for a long time, bro.
[03:26:12.570 --> 03:26:13.291]  Even before that.
[03:26:14.191 --> 03:26:17.252]  And they decided, yeah, this is foretold in our scriptures.
[03:26:17.692 --> 03:26:19.852]  The Gentiles will receive the Holy Spirit.
[03:26:19.912 --> 03:26:21.673]  That means that they can be born again too.
[03:26:22.613 --> 03:26:23.874]  And then here we are.
[03:26:24.374 --> 03:26:24.774]  Here we are.
[03:26:25.777 --> 03:26:42.047]  And so I would say that the last days initiated around that time because all of that had to happen before anything in the future that has to do with the Antichrist, or the Great Tribulation, or the Tribulation.
[03:26:42.367 --> 03:26:49.431]  And you also see this, this is why the Apostle Paul had to address the Thessalonian Church, 1st and 2nd Thessalonians.
[03:26:49.451 --> 03:26:51.953]  He had to make it very clear to them because they were experiencing
[03:26:52.694 --> 03:26:54.636]  Heavy, serious persecution.
[03:26:54.656 --> 03:26:55.818]  People were losing their lives.
[03:26:55.838 --> 03:26:57.340]  They were being hunted like animals.
[03:26:58.221 --> 03:27:12.277]  And it was so bad that he had to clarify, because there were false prophets, false teachers in the church, that were telling the people, incorrectly, that the reason why we're experiencing this massive devastation is because, well,
[03:27:14.073 --> 03:27:19.460]  We may have missed the rapture or we may have missed the second coming of Jesus.
[03:27:19.681 --> 03:27:22.384]  It looks like we're in the time of Jacob's trouble.
[03:27:22.605 --> 03:27:26.209]  It looks like this is that great day that the Old Testament has spoken of.
[03:27:27.231 --> 03:27:28.853]  It looks like we are in the tribulation.
[03:27:30.075 --> 03:27:34.457]  And the Apostle Paul had to clarify that to the church, and he lays it out, right?
[03:27:34.557 --> 03:27:47.021]  It's like, no, the falling away has to happen, and then the removal of he who is restraining all of these works, these satanic, he's very clear, all of this is a work of Satan directly.
[03:27:47.641 --> 03:27:52.123]  He who is restraining is holding all of this back, but once he's removed,
[03:27:52.856 --> 03:27:58.239]  Then the lawless one will be revealed with all of signs and power and lying wonders.
[03:27:58.279 --> 03:28:03.422]  And then God will pour a strong delusion on that fallen world because they rejected the truth.
[03:28:03.722 --> 03:28:05.143]  They embraced the lie.
[03:28:06.183 --> 03:28:07.844]  They brought judgment upon themselves.
[03:28:09.845 --> 03:28:12.167]  And then all of that annihilation follows after.
[03:28:12.187 --> 03:28:21.672]  And it's also made very clear that the Antichrist will, he will declare himself to be God.
[03:28:22.461 --> 03:28:26.363]  That is the definition of Antichrist.
[03:28:26.983 --> 03:28:29.744]  The term in Greek, Antichrist, is pseudochrist.
[03:28:29.784 --> 03:28:35.787]  That means a counterfeit in the position usurping the authority of the real thing, right?
[03:28:37.988 --> 03:28:47.052]  And so, I would be willing to say that I think it's possible that the Antichrist himself might very well
[03:28:48.402 --> 03:28:55.344]  Because Jesus Christ as God in human flesh might might declare himself to be God, but what does that mean to be God?
[03:28:56.165 --> 03:29:00.986]  He's going to declare himself Messiah, the Messiah of Israel, and Israel is going to be deceived.
[03:29:01.026 --> 03:29:04.028]  They're going to cut a peace deal with this guy, rebuild their third temple.
[03:29:04.068 --> 03:29:05.048]  He's going to be a savior.
[03:29:05.108 --> 03:29:06.528]  He's going to be the Messiah.
[03:29:06.789 --> 03:29:08.449]  He's going to be the one that was spoken of.
[03:29:09.069 --> 03:29:11.150]  The Jews will embrace the Antichrist.
[03:29:11.950 --> 03:29:13.571]  You're a hardcore Christian Zionist.
[03:29:14.386 --> 03:29:16.267]  Jew-worshipping pastor won't tell you this.
[03:29:16.888 --> 03:29:19.009]  The Jews will embrace the Antichrist.
[03:29:19.029 --> 03:29:21.370]  That is a biblical fact, okay?
[03:29:22.371 --> 03:29:24.992]  That's why they have the Temple Institute right now.
[03:29:25.833 --> 03:29:26.814]  Right now in Israel.
[03:29:27.214 --> 03:29:29.635]  And they're trying to figure out how to rebuild the third temple.
[03:29:29.975 --> 03:29:32.317]  Yes, it's satanic, but it's prophetic.
[03:29:33.601 --> 03:29:38.844]  So I say that all to say is all of those events that I'm describing, and I'm just scratching the surface, guys, okay?
[03:29:39.925 --> 03:29:48.830]  All of those events that I'm describing, because the Antichrist, he will go into the Third Temple, he will go into the Holy of Holies, and he will declare himself God in human flesh.
[03:29:50.130 --> 03:29:50.691]  Messiah.
[03:29:51.591 --> 03:29:52.271]  The Christ.
[03:29:52.492 --> 03:29:53.452]  The Anointed One.
[03:29:54.373 --> 03:29:56.354]  He will declare himself God.
[03:29:56.374 --> 03:30:00.156]  And so the Apostle Paul had to clarify that.
[03:30:01.337 --> 03:30:02.478]  To the Thessalonian church.
[03:30:02.658 --> 03:30:04.840]  And he says, no, none of that has happened yet.
[03:30:06.501 --> 03:30:07.702]  You're not in the tribulation.
[03:30:09.604 --> 03:30:10.965]  You're not in the Great Tribulation.
[03:30:11.486 --> 03:30:12.326]  Don't be deceived.
[03:30:12.366 --> 03:30:13.487]  Don't let anybody deceive you.
[03:30:13.527 --> 03:30:15.189]  Remember the things that I taught you.
[03:30:15.289 --> 03:30:16.850]  Remember the doctrines that I taught you.
[03:30:17.211 --> 03:30:17.831]  Here they are.
[03:30:19.152 --> 03:30:25.598]  And then he describes all of these, I guess you could say biblical signs that he gives.
[03:30:25.638 --> 03:30:26.979]  This is what it's going to look like.
[03:30:27.572 --> 03:30:28.352]  Here's the indication.
[03:30:28.392 --> 03:30:29.393]  This is what he's going to do.
[03:30:29.413 --> 03:30:32.233]  This is what has to happen first before you enter into that.
[03:30:32.934 --> 03:30:46.738]  So understanding whether you're in the tribulation or not is very, very important because the Holy Spirit, God, his breathed word, inspired word through the Apostle Paul to the Thessalonians had to clarify that.
[03:30:47.118 --> 03:30:50.359]  This was a huge issue in the first century church because people were deceived.
[03:30:50.679 --> 03:30:51.939]  It caused them to lose hope.
[03:30:52.919 --> 03:30:54.820]  It caused them to think that God abandoned them.
[03:30:56.155 --> 03:31:06.478]  It caused them to think that all of their faith in Jesus was for nothing and it actually was causing people to have a shipwrecked faith to view God as a liar.
[03:31:07.118 --> 03:31:09.419]  This is why, yes, doctrine matters.
[03:31:10.039 --> 03:31:14.080]  Doctrine in its context matters because it is life or death.
[03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:20.122]  It could cause you to literally apostate and turn your back on God and divorce yourself from the faith
[03:31:20.740 --> 03:31:31.226]  Because you had bad doctrine to begin with and now you are based off of a lie, believing a lie, telling yourself a lie, blaming God for something that has nothing to do with Him.
[03:31:31.707 --> 03:31:34.008]  You see how bad this could really get to somebody's soul?
[03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:46.896]  And so I say that all to say is when we're talking about the last days, and for any unbelievers out there, I want you to understand everything I just explained
[03:31:48.499 --> 03:31:52.480]  The indication of the last days is not somewhere in the future.
[03:31:52.620 --> 03:31:57.742]  Yes, there are future events in these last days that we are currently living that will happen.
[03:31:58.142 --> 03:31:58.882]  We don't know when.
[03:31:59.942 --> 03:32:01.883]  It could be the next five minutes.
[03:32:02.063 --> 03:32:03.983]  It could be the next five months.
[03:32:04.203 --> 03:32:05.384]  It could be the next five years.
[03:32:05.544 --> 03:32:06.944]  It could be the next 500 years.
[03:32:08.044 --> 03:32:09.265]  No man knows the day or the hour.
[03:32:09.325 --> 03:32:10.605]  Jesus made that very clear.
[03:32:11.645 --> 03:32:13.786]  No man knows the day or the hour.
[03:32:16.587 --> 03:32:17.567]  That is only a
[03:32:18.579 --> 03:32:20.340]  God himself, that's his information.
[03:32:20.820 --> 03:32:26.982]  But I will tell you this, is that the Bible is very clear that the Bible does give these indications.
[03:32:28.223 --> 03:32:45.129]  That all of these indications of the last days, as we are getting closer and closer and closer, the ultimate endgame, yes, is the rise of the Antichrist, is the rise of the One World New World Order Federation, led by him, false prophet, all empowered by Satan.
[03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:48.110]  Yes, the endgame also will be
[03:32:49.039 --> 03:32:53.643]  The mark of the beast in the one world economy that the world will be enslaved to.
[03:32:53.683 --> 03:33:00.948]  And by the way, for those of you that don't have an understanding of the mark of the beast, the mark is his mark, right?
[03:33:01.629 --> 03:33:04.371]  But the mark is required to buy, sell and trade.
[03:33:04.411 --> 03:33:06.413]  That means have access into the economy.
[03:33:07.033 --> 03:33:11.196]  But the mark is to show as you receive the mark.
[03:33:12.417 --> 03:33:15.960]  You are taking the mark not just to gain access into the economy.
[03:33:16.020 --> 03:33:16.941]  The Bible is very clear.
[03:33:17.021 --> 03:33:17.261]  Read it.
[03:33:18.345 --> 03:33:22.768]  That is an indication that you are accepting the Antichrist as God.
[03:33:23.529 --> 03:33:24.209]  Your God.
[03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:26.771]  Your Lord and your Savior.
[03:33:27.812 --> 03:33:40.400]  You receiving that mark is you pledging your loyalty, your faith, your heart, as you are supposed to, to the Jesus Christ, to the Antichrist, the false Christ.
[03:33:42.061 --> 03:33:46.444]  And that's why God takes such serious issue with it at the very end.
[03:33:47.742 --> 03:33:51.546]  And yes, that's a prophetic event as well, and there are multiple others.
[03:33:52.907 --> 03:34:05.220]  But the ultimate endgame, and I always want to ground people and bring people back to this truth, and we know that the ultimate endgame is the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:34:07.219 --> 03:34:07.459]  Right?
[03:34:07.819 --> 03:34:08.539]  You got the rapture.
[03:34:08.860 --> 03:34:09.960]  Like I said, I'm pre-trib.
[03:34:10.660 --> 03:34:13.841]  I believe the rapture will happen before the tribulation.
[03:34:14.121 --> 03:34:15.202]  Others might believe mid.
[03:34:15.442 --> 03:34:16.642]  Others might believe post.
[03:34:17.142 --> 03:34:18.243]  We'll see who's right, dude.
[03:34:19.283 --> 03:34:19.543]  Right?
[03:34:20.263 --> 03:34:20.703]  We'll see.
[03:34:22.304 --> 03:34:26.765]  But the ultimate endgame is the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[03:34:28.946 --> 03:34:32.687]  Because the second coming of Jesus Christ brings in this whole new generation.
[03:34:32.727 --> 03:34:34.408]  We got the 1,000-year reign.
[03:34:36.994 --> 03:34:40.855]  Of Jesus ruling and reigning on planet Earth.
[03:34:43.496 --> 03:34:48.757]  God in human flesh on this current Earth that we live on now.
[03:34:50.158 --> 03:34:52.458]  Jesus Christ will rule and reign on it.
[03:34:52.478 --> 03:34:56.980]  So all of this like talk of climate change and the destruction of planet Earth.
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:58.660]  It's not going to happen.
[03:34:59.562 --> 03:35:05.044]  Because Jesus Christ, when he comes, he will slaughter the Antichrist.
[03:35:05.404 --> 03:35:06.444]  He'll slaughter the armies.
[03:35:06.464 --> 03:35:14.207]  Oh, by the way, the return of Jesus Christ is accompanied with a total bloodbath called Armageddon, the Battle of Megiddo, right?
[03:35:14.327 --> 03:35:15.247]  It's an actual place.
[03:35:16.648 --> 03:35:24.470]  An actual place where this is all going to go down and Christ is going to return and he's going to make war, a sword out of his mouth.
[03:35:24.490 --> 03:35:27.331]  He's going to make war with the saints following him.
[03:35:28.177 --> 03:35:32.539]  He's going to make more war with the Antichrist and the armies of the Antichrist.
[03:35:32.559 --> 03:35:43.924]  And the Bible is very clear and very explicit that the blood will be so high that it'll be as tall as like a horse's bridle, where the horse's mouth is.
[03:35:45.184 --> 03:35:45.484]  Yeah.
[03:35:46.305 --> 03:35:46.545]  Yeah.
[03:35:47.265 --> 03:35:49.686]  Jesus Christ, when he returns, he's going to slaughter people.
[03:35:52.334 --> 03:35:53.314]  Based, right?
[03:35:54.175 --> 03:35:55.136]  So I can't wait for that.
[03:35:55.696 --> 03:36:01.781]  But yes, he will establish his 1,000 year reign and administration.
[03:36:02.862 --> 03:36:03.743]  Perfect government.
[03:36:04.143 --> 03:36:05.164]  You see this prophesied?
[03:36:05.805 --> 03:36:06.605]  Isaiah, right?
[03:36:07.006 --> 03:36:08.107]  Every Christmas you'll hear this.
[03:36:09.127 --> 03:36:10.509]  Government will be on his shoulders.
[03:36:11.009 --> 03:36:12.030]  That's his second coming.
[03:36:13.971 --> 03:36:18.675]  But at the end, Lucifer will be let out one last time.
[03:36:18.715 --> 03:36:20.457]  He'll deceive the nations worldwide.
[03:36:21.588 --> 03:36:26.130]  Get them to oppose Jesus Christ and his administration, us, his followers.
[03:36:27.571 --> 03:36:29.332]  And, uh, there'll be a final battle.
[03:36:29.972 --> 03:36:31.133]  Obviously Christ will win.
[03:36:31.153 --> 03:36:36.876]  We'll cast them all into the lake of fire, the false prophet, Antichrist, Lucifer, once and for all, gone.
[03:36:37.256 --> 03:36:39.097]  All demons, all evil, gone.
[03:36:40.258 --> 03:36:41.839]  And, uh, he's gonna revamp the universe.
[03:36:41.879 --> 03:36:44.100]  The universe will be revamped.
[03:36:45.681 --> 03:36:48.102]  Not just planet Earth, new heaven, new Earth.
[03:36:49.282 --> 03:36:51.905]  And that is the ultimate endgame to all of this.
[03:36:51.965 --> 03:37:01.834]  So when we're talking about last days, and I want to make myself very clear, yes, we need to understand the times.
[03:37:03.315 --> 03:37:14.826]  We need to understand, I mean, when something like the Olympics opening ceremony happens, as Christians, especially if you call yourself a pastor or a Bible teacher at the least, okay?
[03:37:15.854 --> 03:37:23.299]  You'd better be the first one on the front line, biblically picking apart that entire thing.
[03:37:24.159 --> 03:37:38.949]  And not just warning the flock, but this is so explicit, so out in the open, with all of their occult, anti-Christ symbolism, taking apart the Book of Revelation and twisting it with their own meanings, with pale
[03:37:39.767 --> 03:37:42.408]  Pale horse riders walking on water.
[03:37:42.448 --> 03:37:44.308]  That's all cult symbolism, man, okay?
[03:37:44.608 --> 03:37:45.208]  Just straight up.
[03:37:45.388 --> 03:37:55.171]  You got homosexuals with their testicles out, blaspheming the Last Supper with little kids, and some fat 500-pound walrus doing the heart.
[03:37:55.851 --> 03:37:57.572]  Yeah, love to the entire world.
[03:37:57.592 --> 03:37:59.012]  Look at that, 500-pound walrus.
[03:37:59.472 --> 03:38:03.153]  There's a homosexual with his genitals out, little kid right in front of him.
[03:38:03.753 --> 03:38:05.814]  Just blaspheming the Last Supper.
[03:38:05.834 --> 03:38:08.234]  And then they'll say, oh, no we weren't.
[03:38:08.655 --> 03:38:10.755]  That's not what we were doing.
[03:38:10.775 --> 03:38:14.656]  It was about some Greek god thing.
[03:38:15.136 --> 03:38:16.497]  Right, right.
[03:38:17.077 --> 03:38:19.438]  These people are so proud until you call them out.
[03:38:20.018 --> 03:38:21.978]  They're not as proud as they claim to be.
[03:38:22.018 --> 03:38:22.699]  They're cowards.
[03:38:24.079 --> 03:38:25.659]  The darkness flees the light.
[03:38:26.540 --> 03:38:27.180]  That's why when you
[03:38:28.681 --> 03:38:34.325]  Flash the light on all of their darkness, they flee and they start to deny what they're doing because they don't want to be held accountable.
[03:38:34.345 --> 03:38:35.066]  They're cowards.
[03:38:36.627 --> 03:38:37.287]  They're cowards.
[03:38:40.089 --> 03:38:40.509]  But again.
[03:38:42.230 --> 03:38:55.240]  As I said, culturally, Christians should be on top of everything, not being of the world, but we are in the world as lights exposing the fallen world with the word of God and the gospel of truth.
[03:38:56.560 --> 03:38:57.081]  But also.
[03:38:58.300 --> 03:39:06.444]  You have to understand, and I'm speaking to the fallen world right now, for anybody out there that might be on the fence, because I've been there.
[03:39:07.584 --> 03:39:12.247]  Growing up as a kid, watching Alex, watching Infowars in like the sixth grade, dude.
[03:39:13.307 --> 03:39:21.071]  Crazy, like right after 9-11, looking up all the occult Illuminati videos on YouTube and
[03:39:21.883 --> 03:39:32.728]  Looking up all of the occult symbolism in Hollywood and Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj and all these people coming out and saying that something comes over me and I just, I just say it.
[03:39:33.209 --> 03:39:35.470]  And it's like the satanic prayer, right?
[03:39:35.850 --> 03:39:36.490]  In hip hop.
[03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:37.851]  And you've seen this in the 80s.
[03:39:37.931 --> 03:39:39.372]  It just, it just recycles, right?
[03:39:39.392 --> 03:39:42.834]  With all the satanic imagery, ACDC and Van Halen.
[03:39:42.854 --> 03:39:44.835]  They all pledge allegiance to Lucifer.
[03:39:45.835 --> 03:39:46.716]  But I've been there, man.
[03:39:47.336 --> 03:39:51.218]  Taking a look at the world around me and seeing how obvious
[03:39:52.998 --> 03:39:55.179]  The occult satanic symbolism is?
[03:39:56.260 --> 03:39:57.301]  I mean, that's for a reason.
[03:39:57.321 --> 03:40:00.483]  You gotta understand that revelation comes from God.
[03:40:00.523 --> 03:40:05.586]  And what I mean by that is God is the only one that can truly open up the eyes.
[03:40:05.866 --> 03:40:07.227]  And Alex was right about this.
[03:40:08.168 --> 03:40:10.349]  Alex got criticized when all this was going down.
[03:40:11.770 --> 03:40:17.354]  That this is a work of the God of this age, little g. That's what the Apostle Paul called Lucifer.
[03:40:17.454 --> 03:40:22.237]  Not that he is omniscient or omnipresent.
[03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:23.150]  Right?
[03:40:24.872 --> 03:40:26.834]  Not that he's all-powerful or all-knowing.
[03:40:27.094 --> 03:40:29.996]  No, he doesn't have those attributes as Jesus Christ.
[03:40:30.897 --> 03:40:42.147]  But the Apostle Paul viewed him as a spiritual entity that is seriously more powerful than a human being or your average demon or fallen angel.
[03:40:42.307 --> 03:40:46.751]  He's on a whole other level, and he's an enemy that you shall not underestimate.
[03:40:49.233 --> 03:40:49.854]  God is greater.
[03:40:50.535 --> 03:40:52.756]  And if God before us, who could be against us, right?
[03:40:52.996 --> 03:40:54.917]  But you do not underestimate this foe.
[03:40:55.437 --> 03:40:59.098]  Because he is roaming around like a lion, seeking whom he may devour.
[03:40:59.519 --> 03:41:01.499]  That is serious, alright?
[03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:04.300]  So Alex was right about that.
[03:41:05.801 --> 03:41:08.302]  But I will say this, for anyone that's on the fence.
[03:41:08.742 --> 03:41:12.984]  Because in that context, he says the god of this age has blinded the eyes.
[03:41:14.432 --> 03:41:18.495]  of the unbelievers that they might see the light of the gospel of their salvation.
[03:41:18.896 --> 03:41:20.077]  Your eyes are blinded.
[03:41:20.117 --> 03:41:21.097]  You're not born again.
[03:41:21.478 --> 03:41:22.378]  You can't see.
[03:41:22.699 --> 03:41:26.862]  But when you start to see, God is starting to show you these things.
[03:41:28.303 --> 03:41:31.426]  This is part of your process of waking up as a sleeper.
[03:41:31.466 --> 03:41:32.667]  You're asleep spiritually.
[03:41:32.687 --> 03:41:33.207]  You're dead.
[03:41:33.567 --> 03:41:35.929]  You're dead in your sins and your degeneracy.
[03:41:36.810 --> 03:41:38.211]  And you can't even see this stuff.
[03:41:38.892 --> 03:41:40.593]  But now that it's out in the open, it's time.
[03:41:41.354 --> 03:41:42.775]  God is showing you this for a reason.
[03:41:44.148 --> 03:41:49.213]  If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God had raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
[03:41:49.273 --> 03:41:51.095]  It's faith in Jesus Christ alone.
[03:41:51.175 --> 03:41:55.460]  Repent of your sins because the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[03:41:55.760 --> 03:42:01.646]  And if you can't see that now, you better be asking, begging God to show you and for eternal salvation.
[03:42:01.666 --> 03:42:04.029]  Because it's about to go down.
[03:42:04.850 --> 03:42:05.651]  We're all watching it.
[03:42:06.131 --> 03:42:07.312]  And you could die at any moment.
[03:42:07.472 --> 03:42:09.534]  And yeah, it'll sure be over if you're not saved.
[03:42:09.855 --> 03:42:11.556]  All right, guys, the War Room is up next.
[03:42:11.917 --> 03:42:12.998]  I'll see you guys on the next one.
[03:42:13.038 --> 03:42:15.220]  Follow me on X at Drew H Live.
[03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:21.465]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it by the tons, right?
[03:42:21.626 --> 03:42:22.146]  It's a lot.
[03:42:22.887 --> 03:42:29.493]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[03:42:30.194 --> 03:42:35.202]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[03:42:35.743 --> 03:42:43.876]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[03:42:44.745 --> 03:42:45.346]  On the planet.
[03:42:45.386 --> 03:42:52.511]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[03:42:52.551 --> 03:42:56.173]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[03:42:56.533 --> 03:43:00.236]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[03:43:00.776 --> 03:43:07.021]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:43:07.581 --> 03:43:16.952]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[03:43:17.313 --> 03:43:23.941]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[03:43:24.682 --> 03:43:28.683]  They want to do it to destroy the West and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[03:43:29.124 --> 03:43:33.905]  Both of those in their minds are legitimate enough reasons to do something, right?
[03:43:33.945 --> 03:43:40.228]  But let's look at silver because that's what we're allocated into right now because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[03:43:40.268 --> 03:43:41.088]  It's outperforming.
[03:43:41.889 --> 03:43:44.190]  Where were we just four years ago?
[03:43:45.291 --> 03:43:44.190]  1191.
[03:43:46.592 --> 03:43:53.936]  But now since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30 in the last four years.
[03:43:54.356 --> 03:44:00.360]  See, the trend is accelerating because the geopolitical dynamics are causing its growth.
[03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:02.481]  It's not just a flight for safety.
[03:44:02.881 --> 03:44:07.604]  It's not just a way to preserve and protect your freedoms and get out of
[03:44:08.286 --> 03:44:17.968]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[03:44:18.008 --> 03:44:18.929]  It's growing tremendously.
[03:44:18.969 --> 03:44:20.429]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:21.189]  That's amazing.
[03:44:21.649 --> 03:44:24.730]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[03:44:24.770 --> 03:44:29.691]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedom road.
[03:44:29.711 --> 03:44:33.692]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[03:44:34.192 --> 03:44:34.952]  It's a sponsor.
[03:44:34.972 --> 03:44:36.573]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[03:44:37.373 --> 03:44:43.958]  So, I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[03:44:44.038 --> 03:44:45.400]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:49.022]  Everybody should call you to get into silver and gold right now.
[03:44:49.423 --> 03:44:51.224]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[03:44:51.745 --> 03:44:56.608]  I mean, it's like, it's like, it's on record it's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[03:44:56.829 --> 03:45:00.391]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil, and everything's collapsing.
[03:45:00.411 --> 03:45:04.615]  We got to be strong, and America's got to threaten Russia and China to keep us as a dollar.
[03:45:04.935 --> 03:45:06.938]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[03:45:06.958 --> 03:45:09.622]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[03:45:10.363 --> 03:45:12.346]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[03:45:12.366 --> 03:45:15.871]  They just tried to kill Trump just, what, 10, 11 days ago.
[03:45:16.271 --> 03:45:18.455]  They are going for broke.
[03:45:18.555 --> 03:45:19.837]  I wish we weren't in this position.
[03:45:20.317 --> 03:45:20.837]  But we are.
[03:45:20.917 --> 03:45:26.699]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[03:45:27.019 --> 03:45:29.440]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[03:45:29.460 --> 03:45:32.041]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20-30%.
[03:45:32.081 --> 03:45:34.641]  That's what you want.
[03:45:34.761 --> 03:45:37.762]  And silver is the big mover in this economy.
[03:45:38.062 --> 03:45:41.924]  So, go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-300.
[03:45:41.984 --> 03:45:43.964]  We'll explain it all to you.
[03:45:44.364 --> 03:45:48.466]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50% premiums
[03:45:50.406 --> 03:45:52.388]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[03:45:52.688 --> 03:45:54.650]  And I talked to a person, I said, you need Kirk Elliott.
[03:45:55.050 --> 03:45:58.533]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[03:45:58.553 --> 03:46:00.254]  $2,700 an ounce.
[03:46:00.534 --> 03:46:07.099]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on the air, and it's the best investment hands down in an imperfect world.
[03:46:07.139 --> 03:46:12.243]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
