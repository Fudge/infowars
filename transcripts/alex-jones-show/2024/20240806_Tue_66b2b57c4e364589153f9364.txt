[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.901]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.483]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:22.448]  It's Tuesday, August 6th, 2024.
[00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:24.949]  The top Democrat just let the cat out of the bag.
[00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.333]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:37.937]  I've been on air 30 years.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.388]  And going back about 25 years ago when there was really big war news or something dangerous, something particularly deadly to humanity, I would play air raid sirens in the intro of the show.
[00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:01.369]  I probably did it once a year.
[00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.013]  Then when they stole the election in 2020, I started playing it once a week or so.
[00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:09.195]  Now we play it every day.
[00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.039]  It really is a sign of how things have escalated on every front.
[00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.863]  So Iran has ordered the airspace cleared.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.222]  Coming in and out of their country like they did last time in April when they attacked Israel as a retaliation to Israel attacking them.
[00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:29.483]  We've got Roger Stone right again.
[00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:34.644]  He said on air two weeks ago it would be the Minnesota governor.
[00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.545]  And that's who they have chosen.
[00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.385]  Absolutely horrible communist.
[00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:44.106]  The guy pushing sterilization of six-year-old children.
[00:01:45.127 --> 00:01:46.187]  We've got all that obviously.
[00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:54.609]  We have the ongoing two-tiered system in the UK as they attack peaceful demonstrators, but let Muslims run around and attack and stab and kill people.
[00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:05.197]  We have huge news on the economy we're going to be breaking down today, and we have a lot of really big guests.
[00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:06.258]  Let me tell you who's coming up.
[00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.421]  Jackson Hinkle just got back from Venezuela.
[00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:10.641]  He's a Maduro supporter.
[00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:12.062]  He's well-spoken.
[00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:12.763]  He's intelligent.
[00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:15.305]  I don't agree with him on the subject, but I want to give the other side.
[00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:16.466]  He'll be joining us.
[00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.468]  Edward Dowd on the economy and the poison shots.
[00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.630]  He's an expert on the economy.
[00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.353]  Daniel Estlin, expert on the globalists, and more here today.
[00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.174]  Probably Roger Stone as well.
[00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:39.162]  He can only come on at 1.30, but I already had a guest in Estlin, but I may just take over and do the fourth hour, but I'm still waiting for Roger to get back to respond to this VP pick.
[00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:45.866]  Okay, yesterday, right before I got off here, they gave me a video of
[00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:58.089]  One of the top Democrat strategists, and he's right at the top, Jamie Raskin, Congressman, whose father was a famous communist and who developed the blueprint of a lot of the globalist plans today in the West.
[00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.851]  So he's ran the fake J6 committee, all the rest of it.
[00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:15.715]  Raskin recently came out and in an interview at a book signing, a podcast,
[00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:19.758]  Said everything I've said but in his own words.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.461]  They're going to overthrow the government.
[00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:25.604]  They're going to trigger civil war.
[00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:32.091]  And they're going to kill us or they're going to try.
[00:03:34.073 --> 00:03:36.135]  And he says it's going to be a military conflict in America.
[00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.340]  Now you can look at this blob of weakness.
[00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:44.454]  And say, well, he's running his mouth.
[00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:51.520]  No, he's in the council meetings with Obama and Holder and the council as it's known.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.363]  Got a big 40-something page article on that today, an excellent analysis.
[00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:58.045]  The council, who's running the United States of America.
[00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:01.128]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:07.453]  And when you hear him say this, you're gonna go, wait, I've heard Alex say this for three and a half, four years, since they stole the election.
[00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:10.831]  Why is this news?
[00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:14.432]  Well, okay, I'm right about it, but the point is, this is them admitting it.
[00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:21.394]  So if they're admitting something like this publicly, can you imagine what they're doing behind the scenes?
[00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:22.274]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:31.936]  If I talked like this, I would expect to have my doors kicked in by federal marshals and be hauled off for openly calling for sedition.
[00:04:34.397 --> 00:04:37.678]  They say they're gonna overthrow the Supreme Court and the executive,
[00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:39.488]  We're good to go.
[00:05:04.525 --> 00:05:09.689]  Even the average patriot that I know is pretty smart and informed still just doesn't realize how much danger we're all in.
[00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.911]  I mean, these crazies are going to do this, okay?
[00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:13.392]  They already tried to kill Trump.
[00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:19.517]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, August 6, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:21.179]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:28.867]  We obviously have the big imminent Iran attack and them freezing the airspace around their country and in their country.
[00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:31.088]  And what's going to come out of that?
[00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:34.729]  We have the giant ongoing developments in the economy.
[00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:44.431]  We have the horrible governor of Minnesota, with a record almost as bad as Kamala's, maybe even worse, being picked as her VP.
[00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:51.853]  We have armed illegal alien gangs stalk UK while government cracks down on peaceful native Brits.
[00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:58.356]  A federal judge declares Google a monopolist setting the stage for major industry shakeup.
[00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:05.548]  This will be bigger than when it was ruled that Microsoft was engaged in monopolistic practices in the late 90s.
[00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:28.692]  There is so much coming up today, but right before we got off air yesterday, I was shown a clip that was from a recent podcast that Jamie Raskin, Democrat representative in Congress, and is one of the top strategists in the cabal, he's in the Star Chamber meetings, we know that, plotting all this evil.
[00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:35.417]  He made an extremely chilling statement, and I've since then gone and watched more of the podcast interview.
[00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.632]  And quite frankly, I should just drop everything I'm doing and only cover this.
[00:06:41.252 --> 00:06:43.694]  But I know how the audience is and how the world is.
[00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:46.295]  People want me to cover all the big breaking news, which is very important, and I will.
[00:06:47.215 --> 00:06:50.137]  But we're always covering important things here.
[00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:51.297]  Obviously.
[00:06:52.138 --> 00:06:55.219]  And I have very informative guests and informative callers and informative special reports.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.941]  And investigative reports.
[00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.103]  But this is so big that after I got off the air,
[00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:07.789]  I began to research it and really, really think about it.
[00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.634]  And the full interview is very, very important.
[00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:13.856]  I'm going to do a special report on that in the next few days.
[00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:21.450]  To break it all down, because it confirms 100% my analysis of their operation.
[00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:23.972]  Which, if you study these creeps, it's not hard.
[00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:28.815]  It's just the public hears me say these horrible scenarios, and they're like, come on.
[00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:35.160]  My wife, even this morning, said, man, can we go out on the porch with a cup of coffee so my 7-year-old daughter wouldn't hear it?
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.825]  And she goes, do you really, because she's been listening to the show more than usual, she goes, you really think all these things you're saying are probably going to happen?
[00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:43.405]  And I said, yeah.
[00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:45.286]  I said, watch this.
[00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:50.328]  And I played the Raston clip, and I explained who he was, and she knew who he was.
[00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:54.149]  He ran my deposition, you know, in front of the committee and the rest of it.
[00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.370]  And she went, wow!
[00:07:58.071 --> 00:07:58.791]  So, I get it.
[00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:01.872]  Who wants to really believe we're in this much trouble?
[00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:07.374]  But if we do not face the facts, we do not have a chance to stop this.
[00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:09.074]  We have a very good chance of stopping this.
[00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:11.475]  Almost everything they've tried, they've failed.
[00:08:13.453 --> 00:08:14.773]  Against America and against Trump.
[00:08:17.374 --> 00:08:25.335]  But again, the issue is they keep doubling down, and the only place to double down again would be trying to kill Trump, which I said was next, and that happened.
[00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:27.116]  And they failed by the grace of God.
[00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:28.736]  In your prayer, no doubt.
[00:08:29.656 --> 00:08:30.376]  You skimmed his ear.
[00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:31.256]  Grazed him.
[00:08:32.657 --> 00:08:33.757]  Seven other shots missed him as well.
[00:08:35.317 --> 00:08:36.617]  Killing one person, wounding two others.
[00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:40.198]  I guess wounding Trump as well, so wounding three.
[00:08:42.236 --> 00:08:46.338]  Shot one guy in the back of the head as he's trying to protect his wife, daughter, firefighter.
[00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:48.459]  Blew his brains out on him.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.143]  So... The next thing is try to kill him.
[00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:55.843]  Well, they've done that.
[00:08:55.983 --> 00:08:57.564]  And they're going to try again now more than ever.
[00:08:57.944 --> 00:08:58.344]  Guaranteed.
[00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:03.907]  And the next thing is to trigger civil war.
[00:09:03.947 --> 00:09:04.908]  Well, how do you do that?
[00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:06.689]  Well, exactly what they've been doing.
[00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:08.690]  And now he says we're going to have a civil war.
[00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:21.723]  And we're gonna overthrow the executive branch, and we're gonna overthrow the judicial branch, and it's just, it's just wild!
[00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:39.711]  Because this guy's father is a super-famous international communist, who called for re-education camps in America, and who wrote the best-selling books that are the Bible of people like Barack Obama.
[00:09:42.074 --> 00:09:48.999]  So they've got control of big tech other than X. They've got control of the military at the top.
[00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:54.302]  They've got control of the Justice Department, the FBI, and ICE, and their human smuggling children, you name it.
[00:09:55.543 --> 00:09:57.304]  And they're just getting away with every crime you can imagine.
[00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:05.370]  And he's up there very calmly, just like they had the former section chief of the CIA say, we're going to kill Trump on CNN.
[00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.853]  They say that to telegraph confidence to their minions.
[00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:11.534]  So he's up there saying, don't worry.
[00:10:13.564 --> 00:10:24.348]  When Trump's re-elected, there will be Civil War conditions, and we will remove him with the 14th Amendment.
[00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:37.272]  Now, legislation has been introduced by Senator Blumenthal, who has overseen and honchoed and commanded and quarterbacked the persecution of yours truly.
[00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:42.774]  He introduced legislation four months ago that when Trump is president-elect,
[00:10:44.264 --> 00:10:54.766]  Coming up in early November for those 79 days until January 21st, 2025, that there will be so much civil unrest because they're going to activate it.
[00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:55.766]  They've got the police cut.
[00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:58.827]  They put their mayors in, their DAs in, their Soros people.
[00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.787]  The communists know they'll be above the law.
[00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:01.547]  They'll be bailed out.
[00:11:03.227 --> 00:11:06.028]  They'll have the charges dropped on them.
[00:11:08.528 --> 00:11:10.129]  And they are going to burn this country down.
[00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.069]  And then Trump will not be president yet.
[00:11:13.612 --> 00:11:23.216]  But even if he got in, then they will trigger this law that would take over the executive branches, control the military, which is a legislative coup of the executive, total constitutional crisis.
[00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:28.819]  And that they will at least act like they have that authority, which they don't.
[00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:33.321]  It's totally illegal, it's tyranny, treason, literally, the definition.
[00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:36.843]  High treason against the people, the country itself, its existence.
[00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:48.217]  And then they intend to drive Trump from office during the burndown of the country, the mostly peaceful protests you saw beta tested in the summer of 2000.
[00:11:48.597 --> 00:12:04.161]  So this is just a chilling statement because in the New York Times, two months before the 2020 election in September,
[00:12:05.285 --> 00:12:33.109]  There was a big article in the New York Times, Wargaming, had an innocuous headline, I've shown it to you many times, but in there, they were interviewing John Podesta and others who were heading up the Democratic Party, still are, along with Raskin, and they said, we will not accept Trump if he wins, we will have our own inauguration in some place like Colorado, and we'll have a civil war, and we control all the cities,
[00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:37.834]  And we'll just cut off all the cities and hold the country hostage.
[00:12:40.115 --> 00:12:47.579]  Now, then they put out all these TV shows produced by the Obamas, leaving the world forever, and the Civil War, with a $350 million budget.
[00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:55.943]  They have all these academics saying it, and then they say, we're go—and then Raskin says, well, there'll be a civil war because there'll be Trump thugs everywhere.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.782]  And that'll be the right-wing groups they've created.
[00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:09.929]  Think of the Governor Whitmer plot, but 10.0, and the Patriot Front, that's obviously federally controlled, in my view, and provocateur.
[00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:26.121]  Those groups will create the pretext for then the, quote, uprising, like you're seeing in the UK, which the government will then use, and is using for civil control, civil emergency, really martial law by different names.
[00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.302]  So it's the same formula,
[00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:30.092]  All over the Western world.
[00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:43.170]  And so we knew all this, but here he is on a podcast at a bookstore at a book signing, sitting there with a bunch of the usual suspects,
[00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:47.178]  Confidently talking about how they're going to do it.
[00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:57.505]  Just like Bloomberg said, don't worry, right before the 2020 election, it'll look like a red wave, it'll be a red mirage because the mail-in ballots and the dropbox ballots will beat Trump.
[00:13:57.946 --> 00:14:00.167]  Pelosi said it doesn't matter what Trump does, he won't be president.
[00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:09.514]  Now they needed January 6th to hijack one of Trump's rallies to try to make us look like the bad guys.
[00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:13.918]  This time we'll be a lot smarter and not walk into a trap, but they're still going to try to stage them.
[00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:19.706]  So, you need to understand, this won't be like last time they stole the election from Trump.
[00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:25.988]  They are gonna go for broke, with false flag terror attacks, blamed on Trump supporters, guaranteed.
[00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:37.652]  They're gonna bring in an internet censorship kill switch, and they're gonna go after all the main spokespersons against the globalists, and it will be the end of the country as we know it.
[00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:39.373]  Now, I've looked at every angle of this.
[00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:42.932]  And there will be resistance to this.
[00:14:43.713 --> 00:14:45.154]  And I don't mean stage resistance.
[00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:46.455]  It will happen.
[00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:49.857]  It'll be legislative from the states and the attorney generals.
[00:14:50.438 --> 00:15:05.489]  The feds will then set up civil unrest, take control of the cities, but under the state constitutions, when the cities fall, the counties fall, it's up to the governors to send in the state guard and the state police when the left orders the police to stand down and create lawlessness.
[00:15:07.512 --> 00:15:10.634]  We have to get this report that I'm saying live on air right now.
[00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:12.715]  I need everybody else to write articles about this.
[00:15:12.776 --> 00:15:15.137]  I don't care if InfoWars gets the credit or anybody does.
[00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:20.921]  Charlie Kirk found this and put it out and it got tens of millions of views yesterday, thank God.
[00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:36.111]  But conservatives, populists, nationalists, people that don't want to live under communists, just people that are sane, people that are normal, that the left dreads, that just want stability and freedom and peace and, you know, all that.
[00:15:37.655 --> 00:15:38.516]  This is going down.
[00:15:39.217 --> 00:15:39.917]  They've admitted it.
[00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:40.878]  They've pre-programmed it.
[00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:41.378]  It's happening.
[00:15:41.959 --> 00:15:48.404]  So we've got to get the governors and the attorney generals that the left doesn't control, and that's the majority of them, up front and speaking out.
[00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:50.106]  We've got to get Trump talking about this.
[00:15:50.666 --> 00:16:00.215]  We've got to get all of his surrogates, from Don Jr., you know, across the board, to Senator Cruz, to Howley, to everybody, to Paul, talking about this.
[00:16:01.909 --> 00:16:16.922]  Because, again, if you look at the threat escalation and how they ramp things up to try to stop our populist, peaceful take back of the country, all that's left is political violence, assassination, false flags, civil unrest, race war, and civil war.
[00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:19.504]  And so that's where we are.
[00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.426]  So, we're sitting here.
[00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:22.487]  How many days is the election?
[00:16:22.507 --> 00:16:23.127]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.930]  What are we, 90 days now?
[00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.510]  89 days?
[00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:27.331]  I forget.
[00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:29.032]  From the election, 90 days.
[00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:32.368]  12 hours, 42 minutes, 22 seconds.
[00:16:33.288 --> 00:16:34.790]  And how many days tagged on?
[00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:41.075]  If you tag 79 days onto 90, how many days do we have left until the inauguration?
[00:16:43.197 --> 00:16:45.680]  And then they're really gonna try to kill Trump.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.661]  166 days.
[00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:54.628]  So if he makes it and wins the election, and overrides all the fraud, too big to rig, which we're in that position right now, so they try to kill him.
[00:16:55.008 --> 00:16:55.809]  They believe he's gonna win.
[00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:07.714]  And if we make it the other 79 days, so 166 days until he's inaugurated, good chance they set off a tactical nuke and blame it on Iran and D.C.
[00:17:07.774 --> 00:17:12.397]  and kill Trump and any of the Congress people.
[00:17:13.437 --> 00:17:14.038]  Here's what you know.
[00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:26.365]  If you see, if you don't see Raskin, and you don't see Schiff, and you don't see the usual suspects at the inauguration, Trump should not go out on that podium because they're going to hit it with a truck bomb.
[00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:29.499]  I mean, they might have explosives right under the podium.
[00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:31.240]  Drone swarm attack.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.560]  Tactical nuke to make sure they get him.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.541]  I mean, I'm thinking they're gonna hit Trump with a one megaton.
[00:17:42.882 --> 00:17:45.182]  Just enough to, you know, vaporize a square mile.
[00:17:48.103 --> 00:17:48.363]  Yeah.
[00:17:49.223 --> 00:17:50.603]  They're gonna hit him with a tactical nuke.
[00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:54.284]  If I looked into my crystal ball, that's what I'd do.
[00:17:55.244 --> 00:17:55.444]  So.
[00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.569]  That's where we are, boys and girls.
[00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.431]  And then they're gonna come after me and Tucker Carlson and everybody else.
[00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:04.251]  Because they're coming after you.
[00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:06.792]  They're not coming after me like Trump always says.
[00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:08.512]  They gotta get through me to get to you.
[00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:11.713]  So, this isn't hype.
[00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:14.054]  Everybody knows it.
[00:18:15.874 --> 00:18:16.355]  This is real.
[00:18:18.615 --> 00:18:19.255]  And that's where we are.
[00:18:22.096 --> 00:18:24.317]  So the next 90 days are beyond critical.
[00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.672]  The next 79 after that are insanely maximum critical.
[00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:35.375]  And then the first week of Trump firing these bastards and removing them out of power is going to be the ultra danger.
[00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:36.755]  The maximum danger.
[00:18:38.416 --> 00:18:42.338]  The paramount pinnacle of danger.
[00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:45.239]  And there's so many other things they could do.
[00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:46.920]  They might not go with a tactical loop.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.282]  Total stock market crash, power outages, a sniper shoots him in DC.
[00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:52.903]  I mean, look, it's all on the table.
[00:18:54.036 --> 00:18:55.976]  But they're trying to poison Trump right now.
[00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:58.197]  They're trying to put a bomb in his plane right now.
[00:18:58.497 --> 00:19:02.477]  They're trying to roll a truck bomb into Mar-a-Lago yesterday.
[00:19:03.498 --> 00:19:09.239]  They are 100% going to the wall.
[00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:16.340]  So, that's where we are.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.041]  And if everybody else doesn't start talking like I talk, when it's right in your face,
[00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:27.534]  It's like you're at the park with your kids, and your two-year-old goes, Daddy, what's that?
[00:19:28.295 --> 00:19:37.961]  And you don't need to be an ornithologist to know that, okay, it's got a green head, and it's got a brown body, and it's got a yellow bill, and it's paddling around, and it's quacking.
[00:19:38.601 --> 00:19:39.022]  What is it?
[00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:40.723]  It's a mallard duck.
[00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:45.626]  And so I'm just sitting here looking at it.
[00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:47.727]  It's a tyranny.
[00:19:48.027 --> 00:19:49.108]  It's a horrible, nasty one.
[00:19:50.469 --> 00:19:51.890]  Like a doctor does a, you know,
[00:19:53.283 --> 00:19:55.944]  Scanning your lungs and says, yeah, that's a big old tumor right there.
[00:19:55.964 --> 00:19:57.025]  You can see it by testitizing.
[00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:58.185]  Let's do a biopsy.
[00:19:58.225 --> 00:19:58.445]  Yep.
[00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:00.426]  You got, you know, it's, it's cancer, folks.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:01.446]  It's, it's right there.
[00:20:01.486 --> 00:20:02.287]  That's what it is.
[00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.407]  And I'm sorry.
[00:20:03.427 --> 00:20:04.067]  That's what it is.
[00:20:04.128 --> 00:20:16.933]  And boy, I wish we could turn this around without having to face this, but it's like getting mugged.
[00:20:17.053 --> 00:20:18.333]  And I've been mugged a couple of times.
[00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:21.034]  My wife's been mugged, New York.
[00:20:21.155 --> 00:20:22.135]  She was in college on a visit.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.802]  And you're in that moment where somebody pulls a knife out and says, give me your wallet, or pulls a gun out.
[00:20:30.622 --> 00:20:32.363]  And it's in that split second, you decide what you're going to do.
[00:20:33.743 --> 00:20:35.024]  But they're, they got a gun to our head.
[00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:37.264]  And see, they don't want, they don't want our wallet.
[00:20:37.324 --> 00:20:38.205]  They want our children.
[00:20:38.225 --> 00:20:39.285]  They want our future.
[00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.145]  They want our identities.
[00:20:40.165 --> 00:20:41.006]  They want us to be slaves.
[00:20:42.106 --> 00:20:51.109]  So what I've done in both cases, when somebody tried to mug me, was grab the knife or the gun out of their hands and beat the living hell out of them.
[00:20:55.086 --> 00:21:02.368]  And sure, you gotta fill out the police paperwork when they're, you know, convulsing on the ground as you crush their skull into the concrete.
[00:21:02.388 --> 00:21:03.108]  There's a pool of blood.
[00:21:03.148 --> 00:21:05.929]  But, you know, the cops let you out of jail in a day and you don't get charged.
[00:21:06.749 --> 00:21:08.209]  Or you can just let them have their way with you.
[00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:11.050]  And I don't use a violent analogy as saying we need to be violent.
[00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:18.412]  I'm saying that is the moment we're at when you can decide to bend over or you can decide to fight.
[00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:25.977]  And I'll take one look at this governor out of Minnesota, and I'm going to say this.
[00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:29.378]  If I was going to hire somebody for a movie to play the part of a pedophile, I'd hire him.
[00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:34.440]  And we know he doesn't want to have sex with children.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.061]  He wants to cut their penises and testicles and ovaries out and their breasts off.
[00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:42.302]  As young as six, right up there with the Pritzkers.
[00:21:44.182 --> 00:21:46.663]  And are you really going to turn your children over to these beasts?
[00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:52.102]  I mean, how much are you gonna take?
[00:21:53.302 --> 00:21:59.545]  This guy supported burning down Minnesota, defunding the police, but he's got all his bodyguards.
[00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:01.166]  Tim Walz.
[00:22:06.048 --> 00:22:06.508]  And look at him.
[00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:10.490]  Wouldn't let that guy anywhere near my kids.
[00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:12.951]  He's got the look.
[00:22:14.592 --> 00:22:15.352]  He's got the look.
[00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:16.433]  And he's got the action.
[00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:18.594]  In his portfolio.
[00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:23.629]  Yeah, if I had to guess.
[00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.751]  Well, we know what he's up to.
[00:22:27.552 --> 00:22:30.073]  So, that's who these people are.
[00:22:34.156 --> 00:22:43.483]  And they're shown as this nice old man who helps defund the police and burn down cities and defend it, and he wants to cut your six-year-old son's penis off.
[00:22:45.546 --> 00:22:47.768]  I mean, hell, the child molesters just want to rape your six-year-old.
[00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:52.932]  This guy wants to destroy their manhood and destroy their life and have the medical system make a bunch of money off of it.
[00:22:56.534 --> 00:22:58.556]  And they, like, parade little six-year-old boys.
[00:22:58.596 --> 00:23:00.037]  They share girls on stage with him.
[00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:01.198]  I've got video of that coming up.
[00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:08.423]  But I want to go to the Raskin clip now, because we're here talking about all of this.
[00:23:09.605 --> 00:23:12.267]  So here's one of the top tacticians.
[00:23:12.787 --> 00:23:14.188]  He's in the committee meetings.
[00:23:14.228 --> 00:23:15.249]  He's in the Star Chambers.
[00:23:15.689 --> 00:23:16.590]  He's in there with Obama.
[00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.852]  He's in there with the Carnegie Endowment, the CIA director.
[00:23:19.872 --> 00:23:22.193]  They admit Raskin is developing plans.
[00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:27.036]  He's a general, and he's telling you what their operation is.
[00:23:29.398 --> 00:23:31.459]  Here is Representative Jamie Raskin.
[00:23:33.861 --> 00:23:35.522]  And again, I can start and stop this, and I will.
[00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:37.343]  I'm going to play it first, though.
[00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:40.173]  Uninterrupted.
[00:23:41.514 --> 00:23:44.935]  Because how's he gonna override the Supreme Court?
[00:23:44.975 --> 00:23:46.375]  How's he gonna override the executive?
[00:23:46.415 --> 00:23:47.516]  How's he gonna override the voters?
[00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:51.117]  Where's the Civil War atmosphere gonna come from that they're gonna create it?
[00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.859]  See, we have all the other pieces of what they're doing.
[00:23:55.179 --> 00:23:57.380]  He's just giving a boiled-down gestalt of it.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.381]  And he says they're gonna create Civil War conditions, and they're gonna need bodyguards.
[00:24:05.102 --> 00:24:06.403]  They're gonna be in a war with us.
[00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:16.916]  You put that together with Podesta and that big New York Times article before the last general election, and they said they'd basically do that then.
[00:24:18.136 --> 00:24:21.458]  So that's their plan B. But again, how do they get there?
[00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:26.240]  They're going to stage false flags, racial attacks, and have the corporate media sell it.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.241]  Are we just going to sit here and wait until they do it?
[00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:31.502]  I told you they're going to try to kill Trump, and they did.
[00:24:31.522 --> 00:24:32.303]  Now they're going to try again.
[00:24:32.523 --> 00:24:32.803]  Watch.
[00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:37.126]  Boy, I don't want to be proven right when they kill Trump.
[00:24:37.226 --> 00:24:38.726]  I'm saying this, people take this serious.
[00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:43.508]  All right, go ahead and roll Raskin.
[00:24:45.589 --> 00:25:00.555]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly, and the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand, as if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer
[00:25:01.235 --> 00:25:02.176]  We're good to go.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:42.527]  So they're always saying we need protection because they're going to be violent when they're the ones out creating almost all the violence.
[00:25:43.948 --> 00:25:51.334]  So we're going to create civil war conditions, they're going to need bodyguards, and they're going to remove Trump.
[00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:57.798]  Jamie Raskin, one-up Supreme Court.
[00:25:57.818 --> 00:25:58.719]  Yeah, put that back on screen.
[00:26:00.845 --> 00:26:02.446]  Would plan to kick Trump off the ballot.
[00:26:02.486 --> 00:26:03.706]  He's the one that tried all that.
[00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:09.889]  So the good news is that little communist rat thinks he's invincible.
[00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.911]  But almost everything he's been doing is failing.
[00:26:14.832 --> 00:26:16.853]  That's why you saw the assassination attempt.
[00:26:16.873 --> 00:26:28.358]  If I was a betting man, I would say he was in the room with the Secret Service Deputy Director, Ronald Rowe, and all of them.
[00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:33.047]  And so they're going to remove Trump once he's elected?
[00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:48.768]  Because of the 14th Amendment?
[00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:51.589]  He's never been convicted of anything on January 6th.
[00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:52.510]  He said, be peaceful.
[00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.711]  You guys set it up, the Fed's direction.
[00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:59.153]  Raskin ordered all the video and all the transcripts of their fake investigation destroyed.
[00:26:59.533 --> 00:27:03.415]  It wasn't even duly constituted by Congress, just like the Jack Smith investigation.
[00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:09.297]  But he sits there and tells people that, oh, you know, the Supreme Court's got protection.
[00:27:09.677 --> 00:27:10.758]  They've got a lot of guards.
[00:27:11.898 --> 00:27:14.179]  Implying Trump's going to be violent in the Supreme Court.
[00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:16.720]  And they're the ones announcing they want to pack the Supreme Court.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.920]  Biden, last week.
[00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:22.301]  So that clip's a big deal.
[00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:24.122]  They want to create civil war conditions.
[00:27:26.082 --> 00:27:30.904]  And have the legislative, which he thinks they'll control, overthrow the judiciary and the executive.
[00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:35.088]  That would be a unitary tyranny of the legislative.
[00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.449]  Yep.
[00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:37.650]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.071]  Stay with us.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.223]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[00:27:47.164 --> 00:27:52.170]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:59.818]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.360]  They let us private label their products.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.261]  That's why you've already heard of
[00:28:03.962 --> 00:28:04.503]  I don't know.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.160]  Tumeric.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.441]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.521]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:26.542]  They even let us use their name.
[00:28:26.842 --> 00:28:27.842]  It's now our best seller.
[00:28:28.062 --> 00:28:29.042]  We sold out of our version.
[00:28:29.323 --> 00:28:30.763]  Their version has a white model.
[00:28:31.103 --> 00:28:32.504]  It's the exact same thing.
[00:28:33.024 --> 00:28:34.604]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:34.864 --> 00:28:37.305]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:44.389]  So the Democrat Party at the highest levels are saying they're going to create civil war conditions in America.
[00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:54.774]  They've already said they're going to do that by controlling the police and many of the state attorney generals and governors and allowing them to burn down and destroy the cities, even when President Trump is reelected during that 79 days of hell.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.081]  They will then have right-wing groups they control go out and engage in counter-violence.
[00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:09.743]  The media will only focus on that and try to say that Trump is Hitler and create a constitutional crisis and somehow get them to do a 14th Amendment removal of him in Congress.
[00:29:11.003 --> 00:29:13.464]  And that's what they said they're going to do, and that's what they're going to do.
[00:29:13.824 --> 00:29:16.585]  That's one of the things they're going to do if they're unable to kill Trump.
[00:29:17.765 --> 00:29:21.126]  So I want to play the clip of Raskin, but start and stop it now.
[00:29:21.186 --> 00:29:22.566]  I played it uninterrupted earlier.
[00:29:23.507 --> 00:29:25.789]  Then I'm going to move on to the other news, but this is a big deal.
[00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:53.307]  So I'm firing the bat signal here, and I'm asking viewers and listeners, once this is archived at Mandot Video and real Alex Jones on X, or don't wait, go cut it out yourself from the feed and send it to your governors, your legislators, your attorney generals, your pastors, other talk show hosts, because there's nothing more frustrating than knowing the enemy plan and watching them carry it out and knowing how to stop them.
[00:29:55.899 --> 00:30:00.847]  And people just can't believe they're in this serious of a situation.
[00:30:01.668 --> 00:30:04.994]  Now things have gotten bad, really bad, so folks are listening now.
[00:30:06.937 --> 00:30:10.002]  I mean Elon Musk is listening, Tucker Carlson's listening, and Joe Rogan's listening.
[00:30:11.001 --> 00:30:14.022]  They're telling their audiences, and they sound just like me.
[00:30:14.042 --> 00:30:16.102]  And it's not because they're getting it from me.
[00:30:16.162 --> 00:30:16.722]  They're smart.
[00:30:16.782 --> 00:30:19.123]  They can look at it and go, that's true, that's accurate.
[00:30:19.783 --> 00:30:20.983]  They can go out and do their own research.
[00:30:21.503 --> 00:30:27.965]  Half the time I wake up at 4 a.m., and Elon Musk has been up all night, and I see a bunch of his tweets, and I'm like, gosh, that's exactly what I'd say.
[00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.405]  And it's something he's breaking I don't even know about yet.
[00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:33.706]  People ask why I fawn over Musk now.
[00:30:34.486 --> 00:30:36.907]  He's doing irrevocable damage to them.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.201]  And Elon tweeted yesterday about this Raskin thing.
[00:30:40.761 --> 00:30:41.901]  And said, this is very dangerous.
[00:30:43.762 --> 00:30:44.862]  You're damn right it's dangerous.
[00:30:47.963 --> 00:30:49.063]  So good for him.
[00:30:50.644 --> 00:30:52.004]  And good for Charlie Kirk getting it.
[00:30:52.744 --> 00:30:53.545]  And finding it.
[00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:54.405]  And getting it out.
[00:30:55.265 --> 00:30:56.446]  Because we're Paul Revere.
[00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:57.086]  So are you.
[00:30:57.886 --> 00:30:58.866]  You're all Paul Revere.
[00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:00.547]  You can be black or brown or white.
[00:31:01.837 --> 00:31:02.858]  I don't care if you're polka-dotted.
[00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:19.809]  Please, just understand, if you want the inflation to slow down, and jobs to come back, and crime to be dealt with, and not be under a horrible, globalist, pedophilic, satanic Hollywood system, then please, understand that we have their number.
[00:31:19.929 --> 00:31:21.049]  We have their ass.
[00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:22.350]  We have their name.
[00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:29.335]  But, if you won't use the playbook that's in your hands, the enemy battle plan,
[00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:34.381]  If you won't use the plan, it's too horrible.
[00:31:36.782 --> 00:31:43.646]  I mean, Paul Ehrlich and all these globalists said in the 70s, we're gonna taint vaccines and sterilize and kill people, and they've been doing it all over the world.
[00:31:44.687 --> 00:31:46.888]  The UN admittedly did it in the 1990s in Africa.
[00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:52.331]  They just got done injecting billions and there's mass illness and death and sterilization.
[00:31:52.852 --> 00:31:54.953]  And that sounds horrible to say, doesn't it?
[00:31:56.854 --> 00:31:58.355]  But it's even worse not to say it.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.621]  So I see leftists on the street sometimes that listen to the show and they just say, I can't believe you say such horrible lies.
[00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:11.302]  I can't believe you just say all this horrible stuff and convince people of your lies.
[00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:15.042]  Convince people of my lies?
[00:32:17.723 --> 00:32:27.965]  These idiots, just like they can't cook a hamburger, like Chuckie Schumer, were all over X again yesterday showing 308 cartridges and full cartridges.
[00:32:28.265 --> 00:32:29.985]  In fact, I put it on X. Let's pull it up real quick.
[00:32:31.547 --> 00:32:32.608]  They came with the cartridge, right?
[00:32:32.888 --> 00:32:37.932]  So it's an unexploded cap, unexploded powder inside the cartridge.
[00:32:38.012 --> 00:32:40.214]  It's an unspent round.
[00:32:42.196 --> 00:32:46.079]  It's the full thing you put in a gun that fires down the barrel, the bullet.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.381]  And they go, look at how big this is!
[00:32:48.421 --> 00:32:49.102]  They're doing it again.
[00:32:49.122 --> 00:32:50.903]  This would have taken his whole ear off.
[00:32:51.083 --> 00:32:54.887]  They think a whole cartridge fires down the barrel of the gun.
[00:32:58.151 --> 00:32:59.392]  They have all these fakes online.
[00:32:59.432 --> 00:33:02.834]  I'm a former military surgeon, and I'll tell you how it works.
[00:33:03.435 --> 00:33:04.936]  Just a shockwave would have blown us all off.
[00:33:05.136 --> 00:33:05.696]  No, it wouldn't have.
[00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:10.279]  Again.
[00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:14.962]  But show them my response to it, guys, if you can.
[00:33:17.844 --> 00:33:18.645]  I'm going to do a demonstration.
[00:33:18.685 --> 00:33:19.405]  I've been so busy.
[00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:24.609]  But I've got to get out to an outdoor shooting range, and I'll take something like a watermelon.
[00:33:25.908 --> 00:33:34.693]  And I'll set it up with an AR-15 and then I will graze it a bunch of times and have slow motion cameras and show these idiots.
[00:33:35.574 --> 00:33:39.236]  And if you just barely graze it, it'll just open up a tiny little slit.
[00:33:40.797 --> 00:33:44.379]  And then if you hit it, it goes in small, comes out big on the back.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.502]  Only the bullet fires out of the barrel of a gun if the
[00:33:50.626 --> 00:33:52.247]  Bullet only grazes its target.
[00:33:52.328 --> 00:33:53.509]  It creates a tiny wound.
[00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:56.431]  I understand leprous don't get out much, but this is next-level idiocy.
[00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:58.353]  Again, you are showing a full cartridge.
[00:33:58.853 --> 00:34:01.395]  The bullet or the projectile, as it's called, is on the top.
[00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:03.357]  And then pull that up.
[00:34:03.377 --> 00:34:04.859]  I don't even know what cartridge that is.
[00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:05.199]  Pull it up.
[00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:06.160]  Show the cartridge.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:06.920]  That's not a 5.56.
[00:34:09.543 --> 00:34:10.023]  What is that?
[00:34:12.165 --> 00:34:13.646]  Not a 300 Win Mag.
[00:34:15.288 --> 00:34:15.948]  I'm not an armorer.
[00:34:16.008 --> 00:34:17.710]  I can't just tell every cartridge by looking at it.
[00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:20.815]  I don't know what that cartridge is.
[00:34:23.376 --> 00:34:25.877]  No, it's not a .223, which is a 5.56.
[00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:32.439]  It is some other, some other thing.
[00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:38.962]  But the point is, they think in their post, with millions of views, that you fire that entire thing out of the gun.
[00:34:40.242 --> 00:34:42.303]  Let me explain to the left just one time, then I'll get back into Raskin.
[00:34:44.504 --> 00:34:48.766]  There is a cap in the back, or put the image back up at the bottom there.
[00:34:49.778 --> 00:34:52.159]  And a firing pin, when you pull the trigger, hits that.
[00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:56.282]  And the cap is a high explosive, but very small.
[00:34:56.502 --> 00:35:02.846]  It explodes and ignites the white powder that is in the cylinder, going from the bottom up.
[00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:06.508]  Just like a Saturn rocket has fuel in the bottom in the earlier stages.
[00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:08.289]  But there's no barrel in the rocket.
[00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.671]  A Saturn rocket or a Falcon Heavy.
[00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:14.533]  It puts pressure into
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:43.582]  The casing forcing with massive pressure the bullet what's on the top out of the cartridge down the barrel where it accelerates up to what 3,000 miles an hour with a 5.56 on average and then goes out of the barrel towards its target and the shell if it's bolt action is ejected by you going through the action or if it's gas powered
[00:35:44.631 --> 00:35:54.339]  It uses the gas that's left from the explosion to fire the receiver back, ejecting the spent shell casing out of the side or up.
[00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:55.380]  Okay?
[00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:07.010]  Again, today I was driving to work, and twice there were people going 15 miles an hour slower than the speed limit in the fast lane.
[00:36:08.544 --> 00:36:11.926]  And they both had libtard stickers and drive tiny little libtard cars.
[00:36:12.446 --> 00:36:15.148]  These are mentally deficient people.
[00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:17.049]  They can't cook hamburgers.
[00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:20.932]  They think two men can have a baby.
[00:36:21.852 --> 00:36:25.014]  And they don't understand how white powder guns work.
[00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:28.176]  It's only been around 200 years.
[00:36:32.819 --> 00:36:34.160]  It makes the old head spin.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:34.520]  I know that.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.361]  That's a 9mm right there.
[00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:41.013]  This is a good graphic you guys have found to explain this to these ding-dongs.
[00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:43.695]  See, that's the firing pin.
[00:36:43.715 --> 00:36:45.396]  That detonates the cap.
[00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:46.397]  That detonates the powder.
[00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:52.342]  That fires the projectile down the barrel.
[00:36:52.362 --> 00:36:55.344]  And there's rifling so that the bullet begins to spin.
[00:37:00.128 --> 00:37:00.328]  See?
[00:37:03.035 --> 00:37:07.577]  And see, a pistol or handgun cartridge doesn't have as much power, powder.
[00:37:07.637 --> 00:37:08.517]  It's not as high-powered.
[00:37:08.557 --> 00:37:13.239]  A rifle is high-powered because it's a longer barrel and way more powder.
[00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:21.122]  And that's the big difference between a handgun and a rifle.
[00:37:21.222 --> 00:37:25.664]  And I know for gun enthusiasts, I'm not even getting this all 100% right because I'm just a guy that knows how to use guns.
[00:37:25.924 --> 00:37:27.705]  I just... I'm gonna stop.
[00:37:27.765 --> 00:37:28.785]  I've gone on a rabbit trail.
[00:37:28.926 --> 00:37:29.606]  I apologize.
[00:37:30.967 --> 00:37:40.670]  But this goes to Raskin, who can't probably find his ass with both hands, but he comes from a long line of communist scum that's helped, you know, set up death camps worldwide and all the rest of it, and they've had big plans for that in America.
[00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:41.711]  Look at his dad.
[00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:48.393]  And he's got the military under his control and the federal police, and he wants a good old war with us.
[00:37:50.254 --> 00:37:51.534]  Because he can't win politically.
[00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:55.015]  And he believes he is appointed to rule us.
[00:37:58.056 --> 00:37:59.037]  So here he is on TV,
[00:38:02.262 --> 00:38:21.813]  Acting like the Supreme Court's evil for striking down all the stuff he's admittedly quarterbacked and devised his plan, his schemes, to take Trump off the ballot when he wasn't convicted of what they said he was being taken off the ballot for in Maine and Colorado, remember?
[00:38:23.194 --> 00:38:34.077]  And all the other crap Raskin's done, and so he just says the Supreme Court's evil and bad, because Trump should be removed under the 14th Amendment, because he's guilty of sedition on January 6th, which he's not.
[00:38:34.978 --> 00:38:41.060]  Never charged, never convicted, said, don't be violent, be peaceful, I'm gonna go meet you at the Capitol, where they had a stage set up.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.580]  And then the feds provocateured, you know the rest of the story.
[00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:50.042]  So, but he's talking to his idiot audience of leftists, acting like they have the moral high ground.
[00:38:50.823 --> 00:38:51.603]  Let's start playing the club.
[00:38:53.235 --> 00:39:04.964]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly, and the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand.
[00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.187]  What can be put into the Constitution?
[00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:15.352]  The Constitution is, and it says you have to be convicted to then be removed.
[00:39:18.863 --> 00:39:24.265]  So again, he's just, total lie, start over from the start.
[00:39:24.685 --> 00:39:39.530]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly, and the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand, as if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer.
[00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.930]  Pause again.
[00:39:40.971 --> 00:39:41.651]  Back it up two seconds.
[00:39:42.751 --> 00:39:44.012]  The women are nodding their heads.
[00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:48.967]  Did the Supreme Court wave a magic wand?
[00:39:49.027 --> 00:39:49.207]  No, no.
[00:39:49.287 --> 00:40:01.897]  Colorado and Maine waved magic wands and said Trump was off the ballot, even though there was no excuse or he wasn't even charged, much less convicted.
[00:40:01.917 --> 00:40:04.860]  So that's the magic wand, but he just turned it around.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.981]  The Supreme Court is waving magic wands.
[00:40:07.002 --> 00:40:07.462]  Let's continue.
[00:40:08.644 --> 00:40:13.125]  As if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer what it's stating.
[00:40:13.225 --> 00:40:15.666]  And so, you know, they want to kick it to Congress.
[00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:24.008]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6th, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:26.549]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody.
[00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:28.629]  Pause.
[00:40:28.649 --> 00:40:29.070]  Five seconds.
[00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.991]  So, oh, they'll be rampaging Trump mobs.
[00:40:35.922 --> 00:40:47.076]  When Congress institutes the 14th Amendment, and they'll all need bodyguards, and then we'll be in Civil War conditions because they would have already triggered the rice riots ahead of that.
[00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:47.457]  Continue.
[00:40:48.378 --> 00:40:54.360]  January 6, 2025, to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:16.429]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions, all because the nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do, a huge staff, great protection, simply do not want to do their job and interpret what the Great 14th Amendment means.
[00:41:17.614 --> 00:41:19.074]  So he's speaking for the Supreme Court.
[00:41:19.114 --> 00:41:24.555]  He's telling them why we took Trump off the ballot without even charging him or even him being convicted.
[00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:27.776]  And even mainline liberal analysts said it was totally illegal.
[00:41:28.096 --> 00:41:30.197]  But I'm saying they won't do their job.
[00:41:30.597 --> 00:41:32.417]  And so we'll just have a civil war.
[00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:40.459]  Finish it up.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.980]  I want to play the last part again about civil war conditions.
[00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:48.022]  I want people to hear that.
[00:41:48.082 --> 00:41:50.846]  So, this is such a big deal.
[00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:56.032]  And we're playing clips from the full interview coming up tomorrow.
[00:41:56.072 --> 00:41:58.576]  But I mean, look, we've known all of this.
[00:41:59.337 --> 00:42:00.078]  This is their plan.
[00:42:00.098 --> 00:42:04.583]  And now they're going to try to have some political movement, 14th Amendment, not even in the courts.
[00:42:05.264 --> 00:42:05.565]  Here it is.
[00:42:06.877 --> 00:42:23.685]  The nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do, a huge staff, great protection, simply do not want to do their job and interpret what the Great 14th Amendment means.
[00:42:24.365 --> 00:42:30.468]  Okay, so there you go, absolute gaslighting, total crap from the folks that tell you two men can have a baby,
[00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.930]  It just never ends.
[00:42:38.011 --> 00:42:42.472]  Remember, there are also giant child trafficking operations run by Mayorkas all under their control.
[00:42:42.972 --> 00:42:43.632]  They love it!
[00:42:45.293 --> 00:42:48.074]  These people are beyond monsters and beyond dangerous.
[00:42:48.834 --> 00:42:49.114]  All right.
[00:42:50.055 --> 00:42:51.095]  I'm done talking about that.
[00:42:52.595 --> 00:42:59.838]  I want to get into this new VP that's been chosen.
[00:43:01.024 --> 00:43:03.426]  And just remind everybody that she didn't get one vote in the primaries.
[00:43:03.466 --> 00:43:05.127]  Ronald McDonald got the same amount of votes as her.
[00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:07.829]  This is all totalitarian, all centralized.
[00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:10.111]  Everything they accused Trump of, they're doing.
[00:43:11.131 --> 00:43:14.054]  I'm going to shift gears into the situation in Iran.
[00:43:14.794 --> 00:43:21.439]  And it could be the imminent strikes on Israel and the major escalation there that we'll be tracking as it unfolds as well.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:27.183]  And of course, the big developments in the UK that are a beta test for here in the United States and Europe.
[00:43:28.164 --> 00:43:29.025]  That's all coming up.
[00:43:30.086 --> 00:43:35.049]  I'm going to air a special little report here that's critical to the future of this operation.
[00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:39.911]  So I ask you respectfully and humbly to please watch it and to please contemplate whether you want to be part of this.
[00:43:40.912 --> 00:43:43.834]  And then I'm going to come back and start hammering into all the news.
[00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:44.254]  Stay with us.
[00:43:45.447 --> 00:43:52.952]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[00:43:53.593 --> 00:43:55.894]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[00:43:56.474 --> 00:44:02.999]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[00:44:03.019 --> 00:44:06.561]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[00:44:07.042 --> 00:44:13.206]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[00:44:13.846 --> 00:44:22.692]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:32.099]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:33.720]  These are very, very popular.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.002]  Now we looked it up online, it is very, very popular.
[00:44:36.622 --> 00:44:38.363]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[00:44:38.564 --> 00:44:41.606]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[00:44:42.026 --> 00:44:45.450]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:49.914]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[00:44:50.175 --> 00:44:54.219]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.061]  Then the bankruptcy started.
[00:44:56.702 --> 00:45:02.508]  And the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:04.410]  And they kicked him back
[00:45:05.676 --> 00:45:09.281]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:20.656]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[00:45:21.256 --> 00:45:29.643]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:40.372]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth grand, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[00:45:40.793 --> 00:45:42.274]  They're amazing cards.
[00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:44.456]  It's got original art I came up with.
[00:45:44.536 --> 00:45:46.898]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[00:45:47.438 --> 00:45:50.042]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[00:45:50.062 --> 00:45:56.430]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.092]  Because this is a historic fight.
[00:45:58.472 --> 00:46:02.297]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:03.959]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.501]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:11.081]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[00:46:11.441 --> 00:46:16.282]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[00:46:16.862 --> 00:46:18.963]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[00:46:19.763 --> 00:46:25.724]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:26.364]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:46:26.924 --> 00:46:29.125]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:29.925]  That's not what this is.
[00:46:29.945 --> 00:46:30.965]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[00:46:31.565 --> 00:46:44.669]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:45.870]  I know you don't want to do that.
[00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:51.451]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[00:46:54.442 --> 00:46:56.964]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[00:46:57.024 --> 00:47:00.147]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[00:47:00.667 --> 00:47:08.373]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[00:47:08.734 --> 00:47:09.835]  The decision is yours.
[00:47:09.855 --> 00:47:11.256]  This is a limited edition.
[00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:16.218]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:27.143]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:36.467]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[00:47:36.848 --> 00:47:37.728]  Thank you for your support.
[00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:39.729]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[00:47:45.615 --> 00:47:47.695]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[00:47:47.896 --> 00:47:52.457]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[00:47:52.597 --> 00:47:55.497]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[00:47:55.837 --> 00:47:57.038]  That's our only incentive.
[00:47:57.178 --> 00:47:59.678]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[00:48:00.238 --> 00:48:08.180]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.041]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:15.562]  Supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:15.702 --> 00:48:20.365]  But what some InfoWars audience members don't know about is the InfoWars MD line of supplements.
[00:48:20.385 --> 00:48:25.167]  This is our premium line of supplements and there's something for everybody here.
[00:48:25.347 --> 00:48:30.249]  This is the newest line of supplements from InfoWars designed to boost vitality and enhance overall well-being.
[00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.151]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:33.531 --> 00:48:35.492]  Whether you're looking to support immune health, improve
[00:48:35.632 --> 00:48:36.692]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[00:48:36.712 --> 00:48:37.513]  Could not do it without you.
[00:48:37.553 --> 00:48:43.174]  Humbly, I thank you and ask you to continue to support, increase your support, this critical juncture.
[00:48:43.194 --> 00:48:46.536]  Nobody else can tell it like it is, like we are.
[00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:00.675]  That's what the enemy wants us off the air so badly.
[00:49:01.136 --> 00:49:01.416]  All right.
[00:49:01.536 --> 00:49:06.060]  So Tim Walz is a monster and we'll be getting into him some of the start of the next hour.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:13.025]  And then Jackson Hinkle just got back from a trip during the election in Venezuela.
[00:49:13.045 --> 00:49:15.447]  Saw some of his harrowing reports there.
[00:49:16.067 --> 00:49:17.108]  He's pro Maduro.
[00:49:17.268 --> 00:49:19.770]  I am not, but I respect him as a reporter.
[00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:24.854]  Look forward to hearing his perspective coming up and on some other big issues as well.
[00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:28.879]  Then, of course, we've got Roger Stone coming on.
[00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:29.640]  He's confirmed.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.201]  We have Edward Dowd coming on.
[00:49:32.241 --> 00:49:32.902]  He's confirmed.
[00:49:33.362 --> 00:49:34.122]  Daniel Estelin.
[00:49:34.603 --> 00:49:36.684]  They're all popping in for like 30 minutes today.
[00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:40.706]  We'll intersperse news and developments and the Iran attack.
[00:49:41.106 --> 00:49:43.047]  They're probably going to attack tonight.
[00:49:44.128 --> 00:49:45.989]  And then they'll be getting dark in about three hours.
[00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:51.512]  And so the Iranians, they said they would attack by Wednesday.
[00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:53.874]  That's what the Ayatollah said.
[00:49:54.838 --> 00:49:56.480]  And they almost always do what they say.
[00:49:57.581 --> 00:50:00.445]  So, today or tomorrow, nighttime.
[00:50:00.465 --> 00:50:08.855]  Nighttime over there starts in about... Nighttime over there starts in about an hour.
[00:50:10.236 --> 00:50:11.578]  So, I would imagine it was today.
[00:50:11.598 --> 00:50:13.881]  In the next three hours, they'll start launching missiles and drones.
[00:50:15.464 --> 00:50:17.306]  So pray this doesn't escalate out of control.
[00:50:17.366 --> 00:50:21.589]  Pray for peace, folks, because this is a really serious detonator for the whole crises we're facing.
[00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.552]  So we'll be breaking that down as it unfolds.
[00:50:25.232 --> 00:50:27.314]  A good chance during the war room today that's going to be going down.
[00:50:27.334 --> 00:50:29.275]  You'll have live coverage there at 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:50:30.036 --> 00:50:30.436]  with Owen.
[00:50:30.456 --> 00:50:34.019]  And if it kicks off even worse, we'll come up with an emergency broadcast this evening.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.681]  I want to start
[00:50:37.422 --> 00:50:43.604]  With this Tim Walz guy that is for defunding the police, supports the rioters burning down large portions of Minnesota.
[00:50:43.644 --> 00:50:45.124]  I mean, he is a real dirtbag.
[00:50:46.004 --> 00:50:47.144]  Obviously, that's why they chose him.
[00:50:47.705 --> 00:50:49.645]  And here's a breakdown.
[00:50:49.685 --> 00:50:53.726]  Tim Walz has now been exposed as coming after the kids, as little as six.
[00:50:54.186 --> 00:50:55.586]  Kamala Harris must be proud.
[00:50:56.307 --> 00:51:01.388]  He signed an executive order in Minnesota, a sanctuary state for child gender abuse.
[00:51:01.408 --> 00:51:01.808]  Here it is.
[00:51:03.064 --> 00:51:06.266]  Also standing in that sea of people, a parent.
[00:51:06.686 --> 00:51:07.467]  Transparent.
[00:51:07.947 --> 00:51:08.808]  About his family.
[00:51:08.968 --> 00:51:15.272]  My partner Gretchen and I are here today because we are parents of a trans child.
[00:51:15.629 --> 00:51:24.195]  Their child is six years old, and she was as excited to be at a boring capital on spring break as any six-year-old kid could be.
[00:51:25.236 --> 00:51:34.222]  Squirming and fidgeting her way through speeches, hardly aware her existence, is why her parents drove five hours today to speak publicly.
[00:51:34.582 --> 00:51:35.843]  It's a hundred percent personal.
[00:51:36.263 --> 00:51:43.949]  I mean, the safety, the happiness of our child, it couldn't be more personal.
[00:51:45.054 --> 00:51:46.236]  Asher, why are we here today?
[00:51:46.256 --> 00:51:48.960]  For trans rights.
[00:51:49.501 --> 00:51:51.785]  For her rights to be her.
[00:51:52.146 --> 00:51:56.032]  As you can see from this interview, I can't force my kids to do anything.
[00:51:58.263 --> 00:52:00.225]  Yeah, who brainwashed her?
[00:52:00.245 --> 00:52:00.645]  How loving!
[00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:02.346]  And there's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do.
[00:52:26.909 --> 00:52:30.392]  Like Gretchen and I wouldn't do to protect her and others like her.
[00:52:30.832 --> 00:52:32.113]  Look at that disgusting governor.
[00:52:32.914 --> 00:52:33.875]  These people are sick.
[00:52:35.076 --> 00:52:36.116]  Brainwash these children.
[00:52:36.857 --> 00:52:38.658]  Children aren't of age to make those decisions.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.041]  If a man wants to think he's a woman, they're an adult.
[00:52:42.422 --> 00:52:43.062]  That's their issue.
[00:52:43.102 --> 00:52:43.823]  I don't hate them for that.
[00:52:44.143 --> 00:52:46.445]  You target kids, you're a sick demon.
[00:52:47.245 --> 00:52:50.588]  Hour number two, straight ahead, massive news straight ahead.
[00:52:50.948 --> 00:52:51.429]  Stay with us.
[00:53:02.338 --> 00:53:17.790]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high-quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:18.611 --> 00:53:24.035]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:25.094 --> 00:53:33.658]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:33.998 --> 00:53:35.859]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:40.981]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:53:41.702 --> 00:53:47.384]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:47.765 --> 00:53:50.266]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:51.086 --> 00:53:52.607]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:53:53.826 --> 00:54:09.817]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:54:10.197 --> 00:54:16.862]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:19.080]  We're good to go.
[00:54:29.855 --> 00:54:37.959]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:38.039 --> 00:54:44.663]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:47.324]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.405]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:49.605 --> 00:54:59.391]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:55:00.011 --> 00:55:02.413]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:55:02.473 --> 00:55:03.533]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:55:05.194 --> 00:55:11.897]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:17.680]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:26.324]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:26.364 --> 00:55:28.785]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:43.336]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:43.836 --> 00:55:48.238]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:48.298 --> 00:55:52.920]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.182]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:59.282 --> 00:55:59.882]  It's amazing.
[00:56:00.022 --> 00:56:00.943]  It's super high quality.
[00:56:01.023 --> 00:56:02.883]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:02.983 --> 00:56:22.510]  Nitric Boost, Good Night's Sleep, Joint Relief Max is amazing, Nerve Renew, Prostate Support, Probiotic Formula, CBD Full Spectrum, 25 milligram gummies, CBD Full Spectrum, 10 milligram gummies works great, Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system, Superfood Greens,
[00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:23.110]  Thank you.
[00:56:54.187 --> 00:56:55.027]  This is a key report.
[00:56:55.047 --> 00:56:56.328]  I'll come back live with all the news.
[00:56:57.909 --> 00:57:08.974]  Last weekend there was a major rocket attack on the Golan Heights and Israel retaliated by blowing up the political leader of Hamas in Tehran, killed the commander of Hezbollah in Beirut.
[00:57:09.294 --> 00:57:13.977]  And so now everybody, all eyes are on what this retaliation will look like.
[00:57:14.457 --> 00:57:23.499]  The United States will have two aircraft carriers in the Strait of Hormuz just off the coast of Iran during or shortly after the strikes.
[00:57:23.719 --> 00:57:31.421]  The function of whether this conflict goes on longer and whether it goes wider is the commitment and involvement of the United States.
[00:57:31.862 --> 00:57:40.524]  The Biden administration has been very reluctant to get involved and they, along with other liberal governments, it's just true, they have been trying to restrain Israel.
[00:57:41.104 --> 00:57:53.055]  And so I think that this is the go for broke, this is the once and for all war, this is how Israel sees it, where they're going to strike at the heart, which is Iran, and dismantle all of the proxies systematically.
[00:57:53.095 --> 00:58:03.004]  In order to do that, they need a total and unconditional and sustained commitment from the United States, and I think whenever that's required, it always involves false flags.
[00:58:03.365 --> 00:58:05.687]  I don't think I'm the only one with the idea in my head.
[00:58:06.007 --> 00:58:06.387]  That's right.
[00:58:21.573 --> 00:58:24.834]  We have to recognize we'll be engaging Iran on many, many fronts.
[00:58:24.954 --> 00:58:27.114]  It's going to be a full-on regional conflict.
[00:58:27.134 --> 00:58:32.215]  I don't think people realize the scope of all of this, and especially the effect it'll have on the economy.
[00:58:32.395 --> 00:58:38.176]  What happens when all of the world's major oil producers are engaged in an all-out regional conflict?
[00:58:38.236 --> 00:58:43.017]  What happens when there's no trade going through the Strait of Hormuz or through the Red Sea?
[00:58:43.097 --> 00:58:44.997]  It would be a total economic meltdown.
[00:58:45.177 --> 00:58:47.298]  But the United States just needs to say no.
[00:58:47.958 --> 00:58:56.863]  Trump put out a message on True Social a week ago, and he said, well, if the reports are true and Iran tries to kill me, they should wipe Iran off the map.
[00:58:57.263 --> 00:58:59.584]  And that's like an invitation for John F. Kennedy.
[00:58:59.664 --> 00:59:06.688]  That's like an invitation for RFK, saying, hey, if I die, then Israel gets everything it always wanted.
[00:59:06.888 --> 00:59:08.449]  Okay, well, guess what's going to happen next?
[00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:13.073]  I think he needs to commit to not going to war in Iran.
[00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:18.417]  And I said at a turning point a few months ago, I've been saying it from the beginning, I'm uncommitted right now.
[00:59:18.817 --> 00:59:29.846]  But the thing that's going to get me to vote for Trump and turn out, I think it's true of a lot of people and even a lot of people in Michigan who are unlikely Trump voters, we need to be confident that there will be no war in Iran.
[00:59:29.886 --> 00:59:33.049]  So he said in his first term, I started no new wars.
[00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.251]  I'd like to hear a strong commitment
[00:59:36.132 --> 00:59:37.713]  No new wars in the second term.
[00:59:38.113 --> 00:59:44.116]  And I know, you know, for some reasons it's not a good idea because you need to have some flexibility conducting a foreign policy.
[00:59:44.136 --> 00:59:46.517]  You need to, you know, people need to think you might be able to.
[00:59:46.977 --> 00:59:48.618]  But it's too hot right now.
[00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.899]  The American people need to know that we're not going to war in Iran.
[00:59:51.939 --> 01:00:00.403]  No matter what the false flag, no matter what happens in the ensuing days, we need to know this is going to be a president that's America first and keeps the troops out of the Middle East.
[01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:08.790]  I think that wins the election, because in a lot of ways the Trump rhetoric is getting further and further away from the America First message in 2016.
[01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:13.535]  I like to say in 2016 he ran as an independent, now he's running as a Republican.
[01:00:13.975 --> 01:00:22.823]  And it went from trade, anti-war, and anti-immigration, now it's something like cutting taxes, more war, and energy.
[01:00:23.163 --> 01:00:29.888]  Trump is still our last best chance, but it's really now, just like it was in 2017, a battle for the Trump administration.
[01:00:30.249 --> 01:00:31.530]  And I hate that it's this way.
[01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:32.931]  It shouldn't be this way.
[01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:43.099]  But once again, it's going to be the real Trump loyalists and the real America firsters that are going to have to fight inside the Trump administration and wrest control back from the neocons.
[01:00:43.519 --> 01:00:48.363]  And so I think that the path to global peace, it's a policy of American restraint.
[01:00:49.023 --> 01:00:57.645]  I think the only one that can even do it is Trump, but the only way to get Trump to do it is to fight a battle within his team and within his future administration.
[01:00:57.925 --> 01:01:02.966]  Because what was interesting is when Trump came to power, the world leaders actually kind of liked him.
[01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:11.629]  Like Kim Jong-un, who has every reason to be suspicious of and hate the United States, he actually thought Trump was kind of cool, and they were like hanging out.
[01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:14.049]  I know people are skeptical of that, but it spoke to something.
[01:01:14.449 --> 01:01:17.510]  Trump represented to the world a breakthrough
[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:24.695]  We're now that you're getting the American people instead of this blob, instead of this foreign policy, ultra rich blob.
[01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:26.276]  Putin talked about that.
[01:01:26.636 --> 01:01:28.137]  Kim Jong Un recognized that.
[01:01:28.157 --> 01:01:30.398]  I think a lot of people recognize that.
[01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:33.700]  And now we've just been submerged back under the blob.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:39.104]  So that that's really the tension in the United States, because I think everybody recognizes the people are good.
[01:01:39.304 --> 01:01:45.367]  But it is these global elites who are more powerful than ever in tech, in finance, and so on.
[01:01:45.847 --> 01:01:51.350]  And I think they're bringing the world to a very sad, impoverished, dangerous place.
[01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:53.711]  And it has very little to do with the people of the world.
[01:02:07.532 --> 01:02:11.394]  All right, Roger Stone called it more than two weeks ago here on the broadcast.
[01:02:12.014 --> 01:02:13.675]  He joins us at 2 p.m.
[01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:34.945]  today and two hours and six minutes from now, or roughly exactly two hours, we'll be coming to the segment, so exactly two hours from now, Roger Stone called it again when nobody was saying it was going to be this particular individual, Walls, but they have picked Tim Walls, who is particularly horrible out of a horrible field of people.
[01:02:36.547 --> 01:02:44.934]  The dual citizenship of Shapiro did not work well with her pro-Palestine, anti-Israel club.
[01:02:44.954 --> 01:02:51.500]  And so now she's chosen this guy, who's a pro-Islamic invasion individual.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.403]  And then he also is for open borders.
[01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.846]  He is for chopping the penises of six-year-old boys off.
[01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:02.534]  I mean, he is for rioting and burning down buildings.
[01:03:02.594 --> 01:03:05.175]  If you're a leftist, he's for defunding the police.
[01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.856]  He is bad news.
[01:03:08.477 --> 01:03:09.077]  Super bad.
[01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:13.959]  And that's what you would expect from these people.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:21.543]  And that means they would probably try to remove Kamala very quickly and put him in as the president.
[01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:26.485]  Extremely creepy at every level.
[01:03:27.926 --> 01:03:28.366]  Meanwhile,
[01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:36.498]  Voters believe in major polls Harris will be the same or worse than Biden for the economy.
[01:03:36.878 --> 01:03:37.559]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:41.945]  We have that clip of Biden just last week saying, I fix the economy.
[01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.507]  What was the exact statement?
[01:03:44.629 --> 01:03:45.550]  I fix the economy.
[01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:46.612]  I save the economy.
[01:03:48.527 --> 01:03:51.329]  He cured, he cured the economy.
[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.911]  Let's get that clip ready again in a minute.
[01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:56.994]  Maybe roll it three times back to back because it's so amazing.
[01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.295]  We all know when the real economy is in shambles.
[01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:07.522]  But Trump has come out and pointed out that Kamala crash is going to be very, very serious.
[01:04:07.562 --> 01:04:08.703]  Stock markets crashing.
[01:04:09.203 --> 01:04:09.904]  I told you so.
[01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:11.345]  Kamala doesn't have a clue.
[01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.546]  Biden is sound asleep.
[01:04:12.986 --> 01:04:14.207]  All caused by inept U.S.
[01:04:14.227 --> 01:04:17.069]  leadership, which the globalists want because they're robbing the country blind.
[01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.232]  Another true social post.
[01:04:33.243 --> 01:04:34.403]  Stock markets are crashing.
[01:04:34.444 --> 01:04:35.484]  Job numbers are terrible.
[01:04:35.544 --> 01:04:37.024]  We are heading towards World War III.
[01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:38.945]  It just continues on.
[01:04:39.465 --> 01:04:41.546]  Of course, there's a massive market downturn.
[01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:44.187]  Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe.
[01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:49.249]  Markets will never accept the radical left lunatic that destroyed San Francisco and California as a whole.
[01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:51.490]  Next move, the Great Depression 2024.
[01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.231]  You can't play games with markets.
[01:04:53.271 --> 01:04:54.131]  Kamala, crash.
[01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.650]  There's another one.
[01:04:55.931 --> 01:04:56.771]  Voters have a choice.
[01:04:57.091 --> 01:05:01.495]  Trump prosperity or Kamala crash and Great Depression of 2024.
[01:05:02.175 --> 01:05:06.999]  Not to mention the probability of World War III if these very stupid people remain in office.
[01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:08.880]  Remember, Trump was right about everything.
[01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:14.825]  And even Jim Cramer came out and said, if you want a good economy, vote Trump.
[01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:21.070]  So even idiot leftists have some type of survival instinct.
[01:05:22.165 --> 01:05:23.085]  Voters have a choice.
[01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:25.706]  Trump prosperity or the Kamala crash and Great Depression.
[01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:27.626]  Not to mention probably World War III.
[01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:28.906]  Alright, so.
[01:05:31.107 --> 01:05:32.667]  The markets are continuing to be down.
[01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:33.987]  They're trying to basically prop them up.
[01:05:34.007 --> 01:05:38.448]  But we knew when Warren Buffett called the top last Friday dumping 55% of his Apple stock.
[01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:43.509]  He's at $277 billion in cash to buy everything up in the collapse.
[01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.170]  They may prop it up a few months.
[01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:52.678]  But they're going to write it up and down for a while, but I believe we've hit the top of the stock market for a very long time to come.
[01:05:52.718 --> 01:05:55.359]  It's been massively high because of inflation.
[01:05:55.819 --> 01:06:00.161]  That's been a place they've been hiding the inflation, but that's not going to work anymore.
[01:06:01.562 --> 01:06:07.745]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play a clip 13 and 18 just to remind you how idiotic Kamala is.
[01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:13.207]  And then right after that, go ahead and play the Biden clip about how he cured the economy.
[01:06:15.748 --> 01:06:24.274]  And as a woman, there's a balance to be struck between being tough and being a bitch.
[01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.064]  You know, we have to stay woke.
[01:06:41.784 --> 01:06:45.687]  Like, everybody needs to be woke.
[01:06:46.027 --> 01:06:52.551]  And you can talk about if you're the wokest or woker, but just stay more woke than less woke.
[01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:54.412]  You know what woke means?
[01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:55.432]  It means you're a loser.
[01:06:55.873 --> 01:06:56.753]  Everything woke.
[01:06:59.135 --> 01:06:59.915]  Everything woke.
[01:07:02.517 --> 01:07:03.037]  It's true.
[01:07:04.178 --> 01:07:06.939]  Everything woke turns to shit, okay?
[01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:07.940]  It's true.
[01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:27.290]  Another pedophile lunatic?
[01:07:54.614 --> 01:08:00.507]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:08:00.527 --> 01:08:03.533]  I just wanted you to be sure you could hear that and see that as we played a few times.
[01:08:04.483 --> 01:08:08.226]  All right, Jackson Hinkle is a very informative and smart journalist.
[01:08:08.306 --> 01:08:11.028]  I agree with him on about 80% of what he has to say.
[01:08:11.048 --> 01:08:15.711]  I'm not a big fan of Maduro or communism, and I'm also not a fan of globalism.
[01:08:15.731 --> 01:08:17.833]  It's kind of like I don't like arsenic or cyanide.
[01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:23.156]  But he has a lot of bravery to go down there in the middle of that war zone during the election.
[01:08:23.216 --> 01:08:25.098]  He just got back after weeks down there.
[01:08:26.408 --> 01:08:26.968]  We're good to go.
[01:08:47.663 --> 01:08:49.365]  On social media, even more so today.
[01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:52.127]  And he's an ex at Jackson Hinkle.
[01:08:52.548 --> 01:08:54.650]  And again, Mr. Hinkle, as you know, I'm not a Marxist.
[01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.071]  I disagree with that vehemently.
[01:08:56.511 --> 01:09:00.075]  But at least you're being honest about your political aims.
[01:09:00.115 --> 01:09:03.958]  The globalists have a fascist system that masquerades as communism.
[01:09:03.998 --> 01:09:06.561]  And if it could possibly be worse, it is in my view.
[01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:07.742]  But we can disagree on that.
[01:09:07.762 --> 01:09:10.805]  You've got a lot of amazing reports you filed in Venezuela.
[01:09:11.365 --> 01:09:16.611]  So I thought we would give a perspective from somebody that's pro Maduro of what happened.
[01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:20.374]  I saw he came out and called Elon Musk and everybody part of a devil cult.
[01:09:20.695 --> 01:09:24.239]  And when I said that was bold, well, I've studied who's in devil cults.
[01:09:25.139 --> 01:09:27.762]  And I know who the globalists are and who's in skull and bones.
[01:09:27.822 --> 01:09:28.843]  It's not Elon Musk.
[01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.705]  But, you know, regardless, you were down there.
[01:09:30.725 --> 01:09:31.646]  You had a lot of access.
[01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:32.908]  So thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.481]  Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[01:09:35.581 --> 01:09:41.724]  And we always have the common enemy of Trotsky and Klaus Schwab and the globalists.
[01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:46.846]  As a Stalinist, we can, you know, I can align with you on those points.
[01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:53.230]  And what I saw in Venezuela is that the globalists are coming after President Maduro like never before.
[01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:57.252]  Venezuela has the most oil on the face of the earth out of any country.
[01:09:57.532 --> 01:09:57.872]  I don't know.
[01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:17.612]  We're good to go.
[01:10:38.647 --> 01:10:45.910]  So what I see in Venezuela is a man who's fighting for his country's sovereignty, fighting to regain their independence.
[01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:51.312]  And actually, Venezuela is now the fastest growing economy in all of South America.
[01:10:51.672 --> 01:10:53.833]  They brought inflation from 36,000% down to about 2.5% per month.
[01:10:53.893 --> 01:10:55.193]  And the elections were lied about
[01:11:01.075 --> 01:11:09.302]  Day in and day out by people like Elon Musk who have huge deals with the Pentagon and would love to get their hands on the resources in this country.
[01:11:11.052 --> 01:11:17.477]  There's no doubt that if I don't like communism in Maduro, that certainly the globalists want to go in there and exploit Venezuela.
[01:11:17.497 --> 01:11:18.558]  I think that's a true statement.
[01:11:19.038 --> 01:11:22.160]  But so my conservative audience is very informed.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.563]  We have a lot of other people that aren't historically informed who don't know.
[01:11:26.884 --> 01:11:30.746]  There is a big distinction between being a Stalinist and a Trotskyite.
[01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.649]  And people that don't know, you might want to explain to them, Trotsky got kicked out
[01:11:34.793 --> 01:11:39.036]  By Stalin, and because of the purges and things he was running against Christians and other people.
[01:11:39.516 --> 01:11:40.757]  He then runs to Mexico.
[01:11:41.137 --> 01:11:46.180]  He gets killed by a Stalin assassin with an ice axe.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.383]  The axe is used to cut up big blocks of ice where they had ice makers.
[01:11:50.363 --> 01:12:00.450]  And then all that funding that he ran away with, the equivalent of hundreds of billions today, gets put into the neocons and taken over the Republican Party.
[01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:07.476]  And so they get full control by the 1988 with Herbert Walker Bush getting in.
[01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:11.860]  And so really that is a serious block of the neocons.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.746]  And the policies we see today running a lot of the left is a Trotskyite permutation.
[01:12:17.786 --> 01:12:20.768]  The Trotskyites are the ones running the war against Russia and Ukraine.
[01:12:20.808 --> 01:12:22.070]  So they're really powerful.
[01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.311]  People don't know that.
[01:12:23.751 --> 01:12:26.213]  And Putin talks about the Trotskyite
[01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:27.356]  We're good.
[01:12:33.953 --> 01:12:51.386]  Well, Trotsky abandoned Stalin and, yes, was responsible for a lot of those, you know, genocidal policies that he tried to implement against Christians in Russia and, you know, sending them to all across the furthest regions of Russia.
[01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.067]  That was Trotsky.
[01:12:53.127 --> 01:13:00.473]  And Trotsky was aligned with the British and American financial interests that propped up the Nazis and propped up Hitler.
[01:13:01.073 --> 01:13:22.972]  And now we're today seeing that this Trotskyite faction of neocons is the same group of people that is pushing their anti-human, pro-financialist agenda in the United States and Europe, and also trying to bring countries like Venezuela and Syria and Iran and Russia under their grips.
[01:13:23.452 --> 01:13:24.253]  And again,
[01:13:24.793 --> 01:13:30.656]  Really, the idea of Maduro being a socialist has nothing to do with why he's being targeted.
[01:13:30.896 --> 01:13:33.157]  You can agree with him, you can disagree with him.
[01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:40.200]  Personally, I've seen his country have great success prior to the sanctions that people like John Bolton advocated for.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.423]  And after the sanctions were implemented, several years after, their economy is rising once again.
[01:13:46.983 --> 01:13:48.744]  But put that aside for a second.
[01:13:49.945 --> 01:13:56.690]  Venezuela is a country that's fighting for its sovereignty from the dollar, fighting for its sovereignty from the IMF.
[01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:00.893]  And this is what countries all across the world are doing, now joining BRICS.
[01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:07.157]  President Putin just invited President Maduro to the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia in October.
[01:14:07.598 --> 01:14:14.563]  Venezuela will be the next country that joins BRICS, if our predictions are all correct, if what Putin is saying is correct.
[01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:15.983]  If nothing changes.
[01:14:17.064 --> 01:14:20.825]  The CIA is funding Colombian terror cells in Venezuela.
[01:14:21.505 --> 01:14:23.685]  And they pay them to put bombs in hotels.
[01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:27.626]  They pay them to launch drone attacks on the president of Venezuela.
[01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:34.128]  In fact, when I was there, our posts about Venezuela reached over 200 million individuals.
[01:14:34.788 --> 01:14:40.050]  And we were the, our account was the number one account pushing the truth about the elections.
[01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:43.654]  And because of that, the U.S.
[01:14:43.674 --> 01:14:51.162]  State Department and the CIA in Bogota, Colombia, funded a group of Colombian terrorists to try and kidnap me in my hotel.
[01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:52.603]  They found my location.
[01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:53.344]  They doxed me.
[01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.066]  It was all across Telegram.
[01:14:55.527 --> 01:15:01.333]  U.S.-funded propaganda journalists in Latin America were sharing it to their hundreds of thousands of followers.
[01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:09.878]  They showed up to my hotel, but thank God the Venezuelan authorities were able to get me out the back door quick enough and provide me with security.
[01:15:09.918 --> 01:15:11.359]  But this is what happens.
[01:15:11.399 --> 01:15:16.281]  You have foreign governments that are adversarial to the United States.
[01:15:16.321 --> 01:15:18.022]  They're doing more to protect U.S.
[01:15:18.082 --> 01:15:20.124]  citizens than the U.S.
[01:15:20.164 --> 01:15:20.764]  government is.
[01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:22.224]  And same thing in Ukraine.
[01:15:22.324 --> 01:15:24.365]  You have all these people like Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:24.745 --> 01:15:30.806]  I think Elon Musk even now is on the Ukraine government kill list, as am I. And what does the U.S.
[01:15:30.846 --> 01:15:31.986]  government do in response?
[01:15:32.026 --> 01:15:34.307]  They send Ukraine another $100 billion.
[01:15:34.387 --> 01:15:35.587]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:15:35.607 --> 01:15:43.609]  Well, for those that don't know, they admit that Victoria Nuland and just all of them are literally Trotskyites.
[01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:50.323]  And that's why they have this beef with Russia, and that's why they started the war with Soros 11 years ago.
[01:15:50.904 --> 01:15:57.745]  And now that Russia's decisively won and doesn't want more of the territory, the West doesn't know what to do, the globals don't know what to do.
[01:15:58.325 --> 01:16:02.066]  That's my big concern with Iran, because Russia has a mutual defense pact with Iran.
[01:16:03.107 --> 01:16:05.247]  So there's a full Western assault on Iran.
[01:16:05.787 --> 01:16:07.028]  Russia has said they will come in.
[01:16:07.388 --> 01:16:08.548]  What's your research on that?
[01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:16.986]  Well, Russia's providing a lot of missile systems, long-range missile systems, Iskanders to Iran, as you know.
[01:16:17.046 --> 01:16:22.787]  They're providing the most high-tech missile jamming systems that they have in their arsenal to Iran.
[01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:29.189]  And Iran is sending some of their lower-grade, older systems to Hezbollah and to Yemen as well.
[01:16:30.469 --> 01:16:39.771]  Personally, I don't think what Iran is going to do in this retaliatory response to Israel is going to be the start of the whole regional war.
[01:16:40.311 --> 01:16:46.954]  I think maybe Israel will decide to start a regional war after this response is taken up from Iran.
[01:16:46.994 --> 01:16:56.738]  But I don't think it's really in the best interest of anyone in this new multipolar world to try and actually target or start a war with Israel.
[01:16:57.219 --> 01:17:08.704]  What people like President Putin and the Ayatollah understand is that each and every day the West is getting weaker, the dollar is getting weaker, the West is plunging into more and more cultural decay.
[01:17:09.344 --> 01:17:14.328]  So why would you attack them today when you could attack them tomorrow or say in five years or ten years?
[01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:28.699]  Right now there is no, I guess, strategic reason for them to carry out a war on Israel or a full war on Ukraine because what Russia is doing is just a special military operation, not a full mobilization.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.008]  Wouldn't it just be better if we took the country back and stopped all these foreign entanglements and stopped meddling in these countries?
[01:17:45.998 --> 01:17:52.983]  I 100% think that's what we need to do, and that's why we recently launched the American Communist Party in the United States.
[01:17:53.384 --> 01:18:09.875]  We're a non-woke, traditionalist party that's focused on actually unleashing the forces of production in this country, showing Americans what communism is all about, and freeing our country from the control of these corrupt groups like the Rockefellers, the Council on Foreign Relations,
[01:18:10.896 --> 01:18:14.699]  The CIA, the State Department, all the big banks, the IMF, the World Bank.
[01:18:14.979 --> 01:18:17.501]  We want to take our country back, bring back jobs.
[01:18:17.761 --> 01:18:22.345]  China is outpacing us by a factor of two times now in manufacturing.
[01:18:22.645 --> 01:18:22.985]  The U.S.
[01:18:23.045 --> 01:18:23.946]  is falling behind.
[01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:29.891]  We're losing to China in terms of annual GDP purchasing power parity by $5 trillion.
[01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:31.992]  There's no reason for the U.S.
[01:18:32.072 --> 01:18:37.817]  to be pushing these anti-human degrowth policies, but it's because the Trotskyites that they are.
[01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:40.889]  You know, I looked into you.
[01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:43.689]  You're a young guy still, but you were an environmentalist.
[01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:46.070]  I'm going from memory, like a surfer, all this stuff.
[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.991]  What got you into communism?
[01:18:50.011 --> 01:18:52.252]  Because you look around the world, you can say communism succeeds.
[01:18:52.632 --> 01:18:53.852]  China hasn't had communism.
[01:18:53.892 --> 01:18:55.153]  It's had a weird state run.
[01:18:56.093 --> 01:19:00.677]  Monopoly capitalist system that had to deal with the globalists to build them up.
[01:19:01.017 --> 01:19:02.378]  I mean, I just don't even see that.
[01:19:02.398 --> 01:19:03.719]  And then Russia has its own thing.
[01:19:04.079 --> 01:19:05.601]  I wouldn't call it communist today.
[01:19:05.621 --> 01:19:11.565]  You know, more of a production economy, more nationalistic, more really of a free market system.
[01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:17.470]  I mean, what made you, I just hear, what made you believe communism is the way?
[01:19:19.591 --> 01:19:30.345]  Seeing how imperialism works firsthand, I mean, the thing that really shook me the hardest was watching what we did to Syria and what we did to President Bashar al-Assad.
[01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:35.111]  You know, you had the Obama administration that was fomenting all of these
[01:19:36.673 --> 01:19:40.417]  False flag, chemical gas attacks, and they were saying they're going to go start the war.
[01:19:40.477 --> 01:19:41.097]  Then they did.
[01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:54.190]  They backed ISIS, Al Qaeda, Jaysh al-Islam, Hayat al-Sham, all these groups to try and steal Syria's oil, steal Syria's wheat, and prevent them from industrializing into a superpower in the region.
[01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.192]  When I saw that, I began to investigate, learn more.
[01:19:57.253 --> 01:19:58.474]  I started my YouTube show.
[01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:13.563]  And I started to read what Lenin actually wrote about imperialism, how it operates, and I was never, you know, all that enticed with the idea of this, what the Trotskyites are pushing, trying to target kids with transgenderism.
[01:20:13.823 --> 01:20:14.924]  Well, I mean, I agree with you on this.
[01:20:14.964 --> 01:20:25.230]  The only thing, yeah, I can say communism's really bad, but the satanic Hollywood pedophilia, would you say that's Trotskyism, or what would you call, Satanism?
[01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.951]  What would you call that?
[01:20:27.563 --> 01:20:29.164]  It's all one and the same to me.
[01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:31.605]  It's Malthusian ideology.
[01:20:31.805 --> 01:20:33.646]  It's Trotskyite ideology.
[01:20:33.826 --> 01:20:40.608]  It's really horrific what they're doing, and that's why we have to stick together and fight against it.
[01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:46.511]  Even though we have different visions for the future, we can both say we reject what they're trying to push on the masses right now.
[01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:50.372]  Well, let me say this, and I'm following your channel and I forgot this.
[01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:53.574]  You had an 18-minute conversation with Maduro a few days ago.
[01:20:53.734 --> 01:20:56.255]  We'll roll some B-roll of that, but tell us about that.
[01:20:57.881 --> 01:21:09.396]  Yeah, it was an honor to be able to talk with President Maduro, and they're in the middle of an all-out war to defend their country in the face of this U.S.
[01:21:09.496 --> 01:21:13.100]  effort to depose the democratically elected government.
[01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:18.023]  I specifically asked him about his thoughts on what Elon Musk is saying.
[01:21:18.924 --> 01:21:21.565]  You know, I appreciate what Elon Musk has done on Twitter.
[01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:30.150]  I don't know if I like his idea of removing likes and likes on comments that he announced this week, but I appreciate the free speech.
[01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:37.594]  But he talked a lot about the lies that Elon Musk is pushing about Venezuela, how he's propping up Zionists in Venezuela.
[01:21:38.194 --> 01:21:40.275]  And I also asked him about President Trump.
[01:21:40.535 --> 01:21:50.101]  Because President Maduro recently said that had him and President Trump been able to meet in 2019, they would have been friends and it would have changed world history.
[01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:55.704]  And he reiterated that story and actually expanded upon it when I was talking to him in that clip.
[01:21:56.144 --> 01:22:02.288]  He said that President Trump called him at the Miraflores Palace right before he headed over to New York City.
[01:22:03.008 --> 01:22:04.249]  And said that he wanted to meet.
[01:22:04.329 --> 01:22:07.730]  They called him three times and said, yes, let's meet, let's meet, let's meet.
[01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:12.112]  When President Maduro got to New York City, nothing happened.
[01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:13.672]  And he wondered what happened.
[01:22:14.133 --> 01:22:27.618]  Turns out later, John Bolton, Esper, and Abrams, all in their memoirs working in the Trump administration, they boasted and bragged about the fact that they in the deep state prevented this meeting from happening.
[01:22:28.038 --> 01:22:30.160]  With Donald Trump and President Maduro.
[01:22:31.001 --> 01:22:39.948]  Maduro, however, did say also in this interview that in the future, if President Trump is reelected, he hopes that they can meet and be friends in the future.
[01:22:40.168 --> 01:22:42.150]  And he did say he's glad Trump wasn't killed.
[01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:44.451]  Yes, yes.
[01:22:44.712 --> 01:22:47.874]  I mean, the same people trying to kill Trump are the same people trying to kill him.
[01:22:50.276 --> 01:22:54.500]  We've got to go to break here in a minute or so, but start giving your what would have happened if Trump would have been killed on July 13th?
[01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:58.122]  Civil war, 100% civil war.
[01:22:58.483 --> 01:23:03.069]  It would have been anarchy in the streets and that's exactly what they want to have happen.
[01:23:03.109 --> 01:23:09.077]  I mean, they don't want a guy who's going to stop the war in Ukraine and I think it's very possible that Trump will do that.
[01:23:09.598 --> 01:23:10.479]  He doesn't like war.
[01:23:10.499 --> 01:23:11.541]  You know, I've talked with Colonel
[01:23:11.761 --> 01:23:14.182]  Yeah, Trump does not like to destroy things, he likes to build things.
[01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:14.362]  Yes, yes.
[01:23:14.402 --> 01:23:16.462]  What do you think the chances are they're going to kill Trump?
[01:23:16.562 --> 01:23:18.563]  They're definitely going to try again.
[01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:38.647]  Of course, of course.
[01:23:38.707 --> 01:23:39.647]  This is not the end.
[01:23:39.707 --> 01:23:51.315]  And if anyone thinks that, you know, he's safe once he gets into the White House or he's safe at any of these election stops that they're planning, I got a bridge to sell you because they're not going to stop.
[01:23:51.715 --> 01:23:58.899]  And I think you made a very solid point when you said next time it might not be such a brazen attack on his life.
[01:23:58.939 --> 01:24:00.000]  They might try to poison his
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:00.500]  I agree.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.481]  Jackson Ingle, stay there.
[01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:04.902]  I want to come back and talk big picture with you.
[01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:30.952]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[01:24:31.152 --> 01:24:35.715]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[01:24:35.855 --> 01:24:38.756]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[01:24:39.097 --> 01:24:40.297]  That's our only incentive.
[01:24:40.417 --> 01:24:42.939]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:51.443]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[01:24:51.463 --> 01:24:55.306]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[01:24:56.406 --> 01:24:57.207]  We're good to go.
[01:25:19.059 --> 01:25:23.024]  All right, popular talk show host and investigative journalist Jackson Hinkle is our guest.
[01:25:23.044 --> 01:25:26.648]  You can follow him on X at Jackson Hinkle.
[01:25:40.182 --> 01:25:41.363]  All right, we got a bunch of topics.
[01:25:41.383 --> 01:25:43.624]  We already covered some, but I want to go deeper on Venezuela.
[01:25:43.644 --> 01:25:44.524]  How long were you there?
[01:25:45.304 --> 01:25:47.165]  All these amazing videos I saw posted to your ex.
[01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:47.965]  What did you witness?
[01:25:48.486 --> 01:25:49.466]  What's your real assessment?
[01:25:49.486 --> 01:25:53.988]  Then tying that into the world, the economy, these escalating wars.
[01:25:54.468 --> 01:25:55.669]  Where do you see the planet going?
[01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:07.555]  Well I was in Venezuela for about two weeks and what I saw was something that even I didn't expect as someone who questions a lot of the establishment propaganda news like you.
[01:26:07.575 --> 01:26:09.195]  I saw clean streets.
[01:26:09.316 --> 01:26:10.776]  I saw nice new buildings.
[01:26:10.876 --> 01:26:12.177]  I saw happy people.
[01:26:12.597 --> 01:26:18.621]  Venezuela has the fastest growing economy in all of South America and very safe, safe cities.
[01:26:19.322 --> 01:26:20.082]  I lived in L.A.
[01:26:20.122 --> 01:26:32.270]  for two and a half years in Los Angeles, and Venezuela's major city, Caracas, was much, much, much nicer, safer, and cleaner than that, which I guess isn't that much of a high bar if we're comparing it to L.A.
[01:26:33.431 --> 01:26:39.075]  Alex, the one thing I saw that really blew my mind were the elections and how the elections operated.
[01:26:39.135 --> 01:26:40.776]  I was there as an election observer.
[01:26:41.257 --> 01:26:43.598]  Of course, I got to speak with President Maduro as well.
[01:26:43.678 --> 01:26:48.662]  But in Venezuela, I'll tell you, they don't use Wi-Fi for their election.
[01:26:49.002 --> 01:26:49.102]  Yes.
[01:27:21.266 --> 01:27:22.628]  Keep elaborating on what you saw.
[01:27:24.451 --> 01:27:32.373]  Well, I did see also, I'm not gonna sugarcoat things, I did see there were some protests the day after the election.
[01:27:33.673 --> 01:27:37.634]  They weren't as big as they were making them out to be on social media.
[01:27:37.734 --> 01:27:42.236]  I saw individuals like Elon Musk, who I appreciate a lot of what he's done.
[01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:51.178]  He was sharing videos from 2017 protests when the protests were much bigger, claiming that these protests were taking place over the past week in Venezuela.
[01:27:51.838 --> 01:28:00.782]  And what I also think people need to understand is, you know, the first day I got there, there was a bomb placed in my hotel by Venezuelan opposition.
[01:28:01.202 --> 01:28:02.983]  Turns out they paid the guy $300 to put the bomb there.
[01:28:07.285 --> 01:28:21.710]  When I thought about it, I was like, if they can pay someone $300 to put a bomb in a hotel, imagine how easy it would be for them to pay all of the people of Venezuela to go out to these protests and to go and vote a particular way in the elections.
[01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:26.031]  I mean, it's just egregious election interference by the U.S.
[01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:30.113]  State Department and the CIA in Colombia, and they've been doing this for years.
[01:28:30.493 --> 01:28:34.054]  The question is, why are they so concerned with Venezuela right now?
[01:28:34.594 --> 01:28:38.198]  As I mentioned, they have the most oil, they have the most gold, they have the most gas.
[01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:47.367]  And right now is a make or break moment for the United States imperialist actors in Venezuela, because Venezuela is about to join BRICS.
[01:28:47.987 --> 01:28:53.953]  And if the US doesn't gain control of Venezuela right now, they might not ever be able to in the future.
[01:28:53.973 --> 01:28:57.556]  I haven't saw Senator Murray.
[01:28:58.664 --> 01:29:06.834]  Admit this a few days ago that the West didn't just try a coup under Trump, they tried one three years ago under Biden and it's failed.
[01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:14.284]  So that's really the big issue here is what do you think is going to happen in Venezuela?
[01:29:16.314 --> 01:29:20.196]  Well, I think Venezuela is going to go down the path of further sovereignty.
[01:29:20.297 --> 01:29:24.739]  Already, they have very close relations with Turkey, with Iran, with Russia.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.180]  And when the U.S.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:39.829]  placed 930-plus sanctions on Venezuela, their economy, which was growing very fast, they had the highest salaries in South America, the economy was absolutely upended.
[01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.470]  All right.
[01:29:55.587 --> 01:30:09.560]  Oil production in Venezuela went down to absolute zero after these sanctions were implemented because though Venezuela has a lot of oil, it's all heavy crude, so they need additives and light crude and different chemicals to actually refine the oil.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:17.407]  When they started to partner with Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey, not only did they bring oil production back, but they doubled it.
[01:30:17.987 --> 01:30:27.112]  So when people say, oh, Venezuela's communist, it's not communist in the way that we think of in the United States, the George Soros communism.
[01:30:27.192 --> 01:30:29.013]  No, this is real communism.
[01:30:29.373 --> 01:30:37.758]  These guys aren't afraid to actually tap into the resources of the country and allow the people to benefit from the soil that's beneath their own feet.
[01:30:38.258 --> 01:30:39.599]  And I think that's what we need here.
[01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:42.881]  I'm curious, Alex, I know you don't have a
[01:30:43.961 --> 01:30:46.564]  Fawning reports for Nicolas Maduro.
[01:30:46.804 --> 01:30:49.126]  What is it about him that you don't like?
[01:30:49.947 --> 01:30:52.750]  Well, look, I don't like the globalists, and I know they're trying to take over Venezuela.
[01:30:54.051 --> 01:30:56.874]  But I mean, I think there are attacks on free speech there.
[01:30:57.635 --> 01:31:01.018]  And just in general, you know, I don't like communism of any flavor.
[01:31:01.038 --> 01:31:03.260]  I don't like state planning, centralization.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.622]  I get we already have BlackRock as our state planner here.
[01:31:06.904 --> 01:31:07.805]  So I hate that system.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:21.454]  It's kind of like, I'm a big critic of Israel, but I also don't support importing giant Islamic populations into the West who openly believe in their religion, they have a right to conquer us.
[01:31:21.494 --> 01:31:22.996]  So to me, it's paradoxical.
[01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:31.143]  Yeah, I think when you look at Venezuela, of course, it's planned to a certain extent.
[01:31:31.203 --> 01:31:34.085]  It's not planned by BlackRock, as you mentioned, or the IMF.
[01:31:34.145 --> 01:31:35.426]  They reject the IMF.
[01:31:36.347 --> 01:31:38.589]  And they have a lot of private business there.
[01:31:38.609 --> 01:31:49.478]  The main thought process in the planning of Venezuela's economy, from what I've gathered, is that the resources of the country should actually benefit the people.
[01:31:49.938 --> 01:31:57.884]  So Chevron and BP and Shell Oil aren't allowed to come in and rape the country of all its resources.
[01:31:58.204 --> 01:32:01.087]  The Bank of England isn't allowed to steal all the gold.
[01:32:01.987 --> 01:32:08.812]  And this is a stark contrast to what we're seeing in Argentina with Javier Mele, who's a globalist puppet.
[01:32:09.153 --> 01:32:09.913]  He got elected.
[01:32:09.993 --> 01:32:11.735]  He went to go meet with Bill Clinton.
[01:32:12.115 --> 01:32:14.917]  Now he's shipping gold, the country's gold
[01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:16.158]  What do you think of Bukele?
[01:32:29.386 --> 01:32:34.171]  I think Bukele is a Cesarean type figure.
[01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:36.914]  I think he's a brilliant strategist.
[01:32:37.174 --> 01:32:44.862]  And look, I was so happy when I saw him go after those criminal cartel gangs, the satanic gangs.
[01:32:45.682 --> 01:32:48.564]  And the way that he did it really spoke a lot of volume.
[01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:55.429]  Tucker Carlson asked him, how did you come up with this plan to go after all these people that were murdering the entire country?
[01:32:55.829 --> 01:33:03.975]  And he said, Tucker, I got with my associates, I got with my administration, we sat in the office together and we prayed to God for an answer.
[01:33:04.755 --> 01:33:05.095]  I think so.
[01:33:26.241 --> 01:33:27.182]  What is he doing now?
[01:33:27.582 --> 01:33:34.766]  He's going after big agriculture and he's trying to uplift the working farmers all across El Salvador.
[01:33:34.807 --> 01:33:45.473]  So now he's not only taking on the cartels which are linked to big business and major transnational corporations, he's also going after big agriculture.
[01:33:45.613 --> 01:33:51.057]  And I would not be surprised if he will take on other big financial institutions in the future.
[01:33:52.557 --> 01:33:57.421]  Well, there's no doubt that Bill Clinton was involved with the CIA creating MS-13, sending him from the U.S.
[01:33:57.461 --> 01:34:01.224]  prisons in there, and he attacked Soros.
[01:34:01.925 --> 01:34:08.711]  So you see, Bukele is different from the other guy.
[01:34:11.672 --> 01:34:17.298]  I see him as different from just about every single leader in South America.
[01:34:17.898 --> 01:34:22.102]  I don't know if I can say I 100% agree with him on everything.
[01:34:22.142 --> 01:34:24.825]  You know, he's a Palestinian guy.
[01:34:24.845 --> 01:34:27.047]  Two different brands of freedom.
[01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:30.130]  Maduro in him?
[01:34:30.411 --> 01:34:32.473]  No, the guy you were talking about earlier, Malay.
[01:34:33.644 --> 01:34:35.065]  Oh, Malay, yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:35.405 --> 01:34:39.748]  Malay is completely captured by all the capitalist interests.
[01:34:39.788 --> 01:34:54.156]  I mean, you had libertarians celebrating the election victory of Malay, but this guy, before he even got elected, was praising the Ukrainian Nazis, saying that Argentina needs to support Ukraine.
[01:34:54.176 --> 01:34:58.078]  He was talking about how much he loved Israel and the genocide they're doing.
[01:34:58.739 --> 01:35:01.921]  And you had libertarians praising him, but guess what?
[01:35:02.461 --> 01:35:04.042]  Ron Paul was not praising him.
[01:35:04.102 --> 01:35:08.464]  Ron Paul was saying, this guy's a fraud, and no one should believe anything he's saying.
[01:35:08.544 --> 01:35:13.386]  He's not a real libertarian, and he's going to take the country into chaos and misery.
[01:35:13.886 --> 01:35:15.987]  And I think Ron Paul's a very smart guy.
[01:35:16.047 --> 01:35:22.710]  I listened to him, and I looked deeper into what Malay's doing, and now, after he's elected, that's exactly what he's done.
[01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:23.671]  I tend to agree with you.
[01:35:23.691 --> 01:35:28.393]  Malay is there with the IMF and World Bank to loot his country, whereas with El Salvador,
[01:35:34.052 --> 01:35:34.972]  Yes, yes.
[01:35:35.273 --> 01:35:42.556]  Bukele is also using cryptocurrencies to back the sovereignty of his country.
[01:35:42.596 --> 01:35:48.839]  Because look, any leader that fights for freedom and sovereignty of their country from the big banks in the West,
[01:35:49.219 --> 01:35:49.880]  We're good to go.
[01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:20.354]  All right, I've asked a lot of questions in the 10 minutes we have left with Jackson Hinkle.
[01:36:21.215 --> 01:36:30.628]  Tying it all together, where China's really going, the world economy, the stock market route we just saw, Warren Buffett dumping 55% of his Apple stock.
[01:36:30.948 --> 01:36:31.910]  What does that signify to you?
[01:36:33.971 --> 01:36:41.258]  Well, to me, it signifies that the leaders of the West are beginning to understand that the fat lady is singing.
[01:36:41.578 --> 01:36:48.865]  China was just offered a big deal by the IMF to help with their housing market issues.
[01:36:48.905 --> 01:36:55.311]  The IMF said, we need to come in and help you guys because the IMF supposedly is helping countries all across the world.
[01:36:55.471 --> 01:36:57.193]  No, that's not what's happening.
[01:36:57.894 --> 01:36:58.975]  China said no.
[01:36:59.215 --> 01:37:00.216]  We don't want your help.
[01:37:00.296 --> 01:37:02.297]  We're going to fix our problems on our own.
[01:37:02.357 --> 01:37:07.599]  We can recognize there are problems, but the IMF is not going to be here to help us.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.902]  China has rejected IMF support for decades and decades now.
[01:37:12.002 --> 01:37:13.663]  They will not work with the IMF.
[01:37:14.663 --> 01:37:19.586]  And they're building this multipolar world that's going to completely abandon the dollar.
[01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:34.017]  The US needs to recognize that we have to be a nation amongst nations rather than a nation that can wield the power of the dollar, which is a fake currency, and wield the power of our economy, which is a fake economy.
[01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:40.302]  It's all stock buybacks, dividends, interest, high interest loans, all these sorts of things.
[01:37:41.283 --> 01:38:01.523]  We need to recognize that we actually have to start producing again, we have to care about the people of our country again, and we have to recognize that if we want to maintain our somewhat of a position in this new order, that we have to actually respect our neighbors and respect the other powers in this world, rather than trying to start World War III against them.
[01:38:03.561 --> 01:38:04.902]  But the globalists don't give up.
[01:38:05.743 --> 01:38:07.184]  What do you think they're about to try?
[01:38:07.805 --> 01:38:08.706]  To stop Trump?
[01:38:08.866 --> 01:38:09.907]  To stop Russia?
[01:38:09.987 --> 01:38:12.949]  I mean, Russia's not perfect, China's not, any of this.
[01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:15.532]  But clearly, the globalists are the ones on top of Americans.
[01:38:15.552 --> 01:38:17.634]  They're the elephant sitting on us.
[01:38:18.034 --> 01:38:19.355]  That's who rules us right now.
[01:38:20.016 --> 01:38:25.581]  So, you know, the globalist enemies are our friends, just by extension, because the globalists see the American people as an enemy.
[01:38:26.261 --> 01:38:28.884]  How do you see the globalists striking back, trying to maintain control?
[01:38:30.714 --> 01:38:39.183]  Look, this week is going to be, um, could be a tipping point for the relative peace that we have on Earth today.
[01:38:39.263 --> 01:38:42.627]  I know that sounds crazy to say that we have relative peace today.
[01:38:42.647 --> 01:38:43.248]  No, no, no, I agree.
[01:38:43.348 --> 01:38:43.548]  I agree.
[01:38:43.568 --> 01:38:46.111]  We're in peace compared to what is about to happen if this keeps going.
[01:38:46.977 --> 01:38:48.038]  Yes, yes.
[01:38:48.378 --> 01:39:05.111]  I mean, look, like I said in the first segment, I don't think Iran is going to start an all-out war, but they are going to respond to what Israel did, and Israel, at the behest of the United States or on their own accord, might start a war against Iran after this retaliatory attack.
[01:39:06.071 --> 01:39:07.872]  It seems to me like the U.S.
[01:39:08.112 --> 01:39:11.434]  is very much in support of what Israel's doing.
[01:39:11.854 --> 01:39:14.555]  They have no qualms with it.
[01:39:15.276 --> 01:39:19.918]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris might come out and say that they don't like what Israel's doing.
[01:39:20.278 --> 01:39:22.759]  But who just sent 4,000 U.S.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.521]  soldiers to the region, to the Middle East?
[01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:29.082]  Who's sending all these big warships to the region?
[01:39:29.102 --> 01:39:30.323]  It's the United States.
[01:39:31.243 --> 01:39:32.404]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:32.484 --> 01:39:36.867]  So I think they're fully on board with starting this major regional war.
[01:39:37.768 --> 01:39:38.749]  They're fully on board.
[01:39:38.909 --> 01:39:41.391]  I mean, they just sent F-16s to Ukraine.
[01:39:41.831 --> 01:39:45.174]  They are approving now Ukraine to use U.S.
[01:39:45.274 --> 01:39:48.877]  missiles and missile systems to target in deep Russia.
[01:39:48.937 --> 01:39:51.799]  The hypersonic, it looks elaborate on that, but back to Iran.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.141]  Multiple U.S.
[01:39:54.201 --> 01:39:59.104]  aircraft carriers in the Strait of Hormuz right when Israel strikes Iran and Iran's about to strike back.
[01:39:59.424 --> 01:40:08.110]  They're literally, just like the Lusitania to start World War I, or the Gulf of Tonkin, or the USS Maine, or the USS Liberty, trolling the ships back and forth.
[01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:13.033]  I'm worried that some faction of the globalist may attack our own ships.
[01:40:14.798 --> 01:40:20.922]  Yes, false flag is, of course, it's the tried and true method of the globalists to start wars, right?
[01:40:22.003 --> 01:40:24.585]  And they have plenty of ammo there to do it.
[01:40:25.606 --> 01:40:39.296]  I thank God I'm not one of the US service members on those ships because they're pawns in a complex game of geopolitical chess for the likes of Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and those within the deep state of the Biden administration currently.
[01:40:40.136 --> 01:40:47.983]  And the other thing we have to recognize, Alex, is that with an incoming Trump administration, Trump's a wild card.
[01:40:48.003 --> 01:40:48.664]  We all know that.
[01:40:48.824 --> 01:40:54.709]  We know he put very nefarious figures in his administration for the first three or so years, then he got rid of them and put
[01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:59.930]  True American patriots in at the end and they try to fix the problems of the first three years.
[01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:08.132]  But the West probably understands that Trump will be a wild card again in the next four years if he's reelected.
[01:41:08.472 --> 01:41:13.873]  So they're trying to cause as much damage and chaos before Trump comes into office as possible.
[01:41:14.273 --> 01:41:17.634]  Because if they do that, Trump's really not going to know what to do.
[01:41:17.694 --> 01:41:22.475]  Because what can you do if World War III is already started and the nuclear bombs are flying?
[01:41:23.175 --> 01:41:24.878]  I interrupted you when you got into Russia.
[01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:28.183]  Elaborate on the situation in Ukraine.
[01:41:29.724 --> 01:41:35.186]  Well, the situation in Ukraine is a complete mess for the United States.
[01:41:35.726 --> 01:41:39.967]  Russia is having huge successes in Ukraine, and they're moving very quickly.
[01:41:40.788 --> 01:41:48.370]  They're forcing the Ukrainian military into massive cauldrons as we speak, and they've been taking more and more territory each and every day.
[01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:53.852]  They have liberated over a quarter of the country from these Ukrainian Nazis.
[01:41:54.512 --> 01:42:00.979]  And the reason why we don't hear about Ukraine as much in the media today is because it's a very bad situation.
[01:42:00.999 --> 01:42:05.783]  You have about 500,000-600,000 Ukrainians that have been killed in action, whereas only about 200,000-250,000 Russians killed in action.
[01:42:11.288 --> 01:42:15.031]  Alex, I don't know if we spoke since the last, since I went to the Donbass, but I actually visited the Donbass and I was about
[01:42:37.449 --> 01:42:43.072]  I was about a mile and a half away from the front line in Zaporozhye, and what I saw just blew my mind.
[01:42:43.312 --> 01:42:49.275]  I went to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which is the largest nuclear power plant in all of Europe.
[01:42:49.615 --> 01:42:53.117]  They have six reactors there, and they have a huge supply of nuclear waste.
[01:42:53.617 --> 01:42:58.280]  And I was going around the power plant right next to the front line of the Ukraine war,
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:05.423]  And there was drone attacks, there was shelling, there was bombs that had been hit all across the power plant.
[01:43:05.883 --> 01:43:09.765]  And the thing that startled me the most was I saw a U.S.
[01:43:09.825 --> 01:43:22.471]  missile that was lodged halfway in the ground, about 50 to 100 feet away from where they store all of the nuclear waste for the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, largest power plant in Europe.
[01:43:22.891 --> 01:43:28.356]  They are playing with fire, with nuclear radioactive fire, and they seem to not care at all.
[01:43:28.396 --> 01:43:29.357]  With a new Chernobyl?
[01:43:31.019 --> 01:43:31.279]  Yes.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:39.627]  And I love how they caught him two years ago, it came out even in mainstream news, that Zelensky attacked the power plant and claimed the Russians had done it.
[01:43:42.113 --> 01:43:51.378]  Yeah, they say Russia bombed their own Nord Stream pipeline, Russia bombed their own beaches in Crimea, Russia bombed their own Zaporozhye nuclear power plant that they control.
[01:43:51.858 --> 01:43:54.920]  It's the most insane propaganda I've ever witnessed.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:02.864]  And, you know, I also went to towns like Takhmak, which are about seven miles from the front line, and I saw
[01:44:03.624 --> 01:44:11.449]  I saw tons and tons and tons of civilian homes that were bombed, kindergartens that were bombed by Ukraine using US missiles.
[01:44:11.849 --> 01:44:15.431]  I spoke to one woman whose husband was bombed in one of these attacks.
[01:44:16.151 --> 01:44:19.013]  And Ukraine, this is what everyone needs to understand.
[01:44:19.373 --> 01:44:28.639]  They are begging us, well, they're demanding us that we send more support, more US taxpayer dollars, more bombs to their country.
[01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:34.140]  But they're not using those bombs to try and win back their territory because they can't.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:42.302]  They're up against a country that's three, four times the size of them with one of, if not the strongest militaries on the face of the earth.
[01:44:42.642 --> 01:44:57.165]  No, they're using those bombs that we send them to rain terror down on Ukrainian civilians because Ukraine is very mad at them for choosing to stay in the now newly liberated territories of the Russian Federation in the Donbass.
[01:44:58.561 --> 01:44:59.541]  You know, that's all true.
[01:45:00.002 --> 01:45:02.863]  And it's just, and we know that their military is totally collapsed.
[01:45:02.903 --> 01:45:06.645]  The Ukrainians don't want this, but it just continues.
[01:45:07.485 --> 01:45:13.668]  And then now the EU says it's going to be a 20-year war, but I don't see Ukraine being able to sustain this much longer.
[01:45:16.116 --> 01:45:16.837]  I don't either.
[01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:18.298]  I really don't either.
[01:45:18.358 --> 01:45:24.963]  And again, we always have to remind ourselves that what Russia is doing in this special military operation is just that.
[01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:28.546]  It is not a full wartime mobilization.
[01:45:29.027 --> 01:45:36.933]  If Russia was doing that, A, there would be a lot more people killed, Russians and Ukrainians, but B, this would already be over.
[01:45:38.093 --> 01:45:42.774]  I pray to God that whoever comes into the next administration in the U.S.
[01:45:43.954 --> 01:45:52.676]  settles peace with the Russians, because if we continue to escalate more and more war, this is only going to lead to one thing, and that's World War III.
[01:45:53.116 --> 01:45:55.917]  It's kind of like with the Trump assassination attempt.
[01:45:56.337 --> 01:46:02.018]  If Trump had just moved his head back a fraction of an inch, he would have been killed and there would have been civil war.
[01:46:02.498 --> 01:46:06.881]  Same thing that I saw in the Donbass when I went to the front line.
[01:46:07.342 --> 01:46:08.042]  If that U.S.
[01:46:08.102 --> 01:46:19.251]  missile had been just about 75, 100 feet over in the other direction, it would have hit the nuclear waste, and there would have been a massive nuclear explosion, and there would have been world war.
[01:46:20.171 --> 01:46:21.852]  Jackson Hinkle, very interesting.
[01:46:21.932 --> 01:46:25.655]  Glad you didn't get killed in Ukraine or in Venezuela.
[01:46:25.675 --> 01:46:26.636]  Talk to you again soon.
[01:46:26.956 --> 01:46:30.479]  People can follow you at Jackson Hinkle right there on X. Thanks for the time.
[01:46:31.533 --> 01:46:32.314]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:32.935 --> 01:46:33.677]  We're going to go to break.
[01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:34.217]  Come back.
[01:46:34.458 --> 01:46:41.209]  We've got Edward Dowd, Roger Stone, Daniel Estelan on world events and so much more next hour.
[01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:43.072]  We need your support to stay on air.
[01:46:43.312 --> 01:46:44.314]  Here's an important announcement.
[01:46:54.912 --> 01:47:02.957]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[01:47:03.938 --> 01:47:07.700]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.362]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[01:47:11.182 --> 01:47:16.606]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:26.238]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[01:47:26.579 --> 01:47:28.440]  We had five companies making product for us.
[01:47:29.061 --> 01:47:33.585]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[01:47:34.285 --> 01:47:39.970]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:42.853]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[01:47:43.673 --> 01:47:45.195]  And they said, listen, you know
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:48:02.387]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[01:48:02.787 --> 01:48:09.450]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:21.445]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[01:48:22.435 --> 01:48:30.538]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[01:48:30.618 --> 01:48:37.260]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:39.901]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:48:40.061 --> 01:48:41.982]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:51.970]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:54.992]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[01:48:55.052 --> 01:48:56.113]  Take Turmeric 95.
[01:48:57.774 --> 01:49:04.496]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[01:49:04.596 --> 01:49:10.278]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[01:49:10.358 --> 01:49:18.880]  So, bought these Ultimate Turmeric Formulums, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.021]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[01:49:21.261 --> 01:49:21.361]  And
[01:49:22.648 --> 01:49:35.931]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[01:49:36.412 --> 01:49:40.813]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[01:49:40.873 --> 01:49:45.514]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[01:49:45.834 --> 01:49:49.256]  At info war store dot com from InfoWarsMD.
[01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:51.758]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[01:49:51.858 --> 01:49:52.478]  It's amazing.
[01:49:52.598 --> 01:49:53.519]  It's super high quality.
[01:49:53.599 --> 01:49:55.460]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.882]  Nitric boost, good night's sleep, joint relief max is amazing.
[01:49:58.983 --> 01:50:07.308]  Nerve Renew, prostate support, probiotic formula, CBD full spectrum, 25 milligram gummies, CBD full spectrum, 10 milligram gummies works great.
[01:50:07.348 --> 01:50:15.093]  Turmeric 95, libido RX, better mood, mushroom max for mental clarity and your immune system, superfood greens,
[01:50:15.333 --> 01:50:15.693]  Thank you.
[01:50:44.807 --> 01:50:46.589]  All right, now into hour number three.
[01:50:46.889 --> 01:50:49.651]  Coming up, Daniel Lesterlin, Roger Stone, and more.
[01:50:49.671 --> 01:50:53.975]  But for the next 30 minutes, Edward Dowd makes a lot of great, excellent predictions.
[01:50:54.896 --> 01:50:59.100]  He is a Wall Street professional, HSBC, BlackRock, you name it.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:04.244]  He worked all over Wall Street, the sell and buy side, expert in fixed income equities capital.
[01:51:04.685 --> 01:51:06.627]  He is currently a hedge fund.
[01:51:06.647 --> 01:51:09.029]  He's launched a lot more on Twitter at
[01:51:10.902 --> 01:51:12.503]  Hi, how are you doing today, Alex?
[01:51:12.543 --> 01:51:15.706]  Just wanted to weigh in on what's going on economically.
[01:51:15.726 --> 01:51:18.188]  The real economy hasn't been good for the better part of a year and a half.
[01:51:36.004 --> 01:51:40.646]  The Biden administration went on a government spending spree and created a lot of government jobs.
[01:51:42.007 --> 01:51:45.668]  We were predicting a recession in Q3, Q4 of last year.
[01:51:45.688 --> 01:51:55.792]  That ended up being wrong because of what the government did with the spending and the fraudulent payroll numbers, which even the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said there's some questions about the payroll numbers.
[01:51:55.832 --> 01:51:59.774]  So the backdrop was we were rolling over beginning in 22.
[01:51:59.834 --> 01:52:02.155]  They juiced the economy.
[01:52:02.848 --> 01:52:06.190]  They were trying to get it into the elections to get the pass.
[01:52:06.811 --> 01:52:14.155]  Our economic indicators bounced off recessionary levels, never made it into expansion territory and started rolling over again in March.
[01:52:14.476 --> 01:52:17.017]  So the economy is rolling over hard, the real economy.
[01:52:17.537 --> 01:52:20.099]  And then something broke this weekend.
[01:52:20.159 --> 01:52:23.461]  We've been tracking this for the better part of eight months.
[01:52:23.922 --> 01:52:29.145]  The Bank of Japan raised interest rates 25 basis points for the first time in like 10 years.
[01:52:29.805 --> 01:52:32.608]  And they'd have zero negative interest rate policy forever.
[01:52:33.148 --> 01:52:39.393]  And that caused what's the unwinding of the yen carry trade, which set off a margin call.
[01:52:40.054 --> 01:52:55.306]  Now, it's important to know that Japan has unfortunately been under, their currency has been under pressure because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from zero to five and a half percent and Japan did not raise interest rates.
[01:52:55.799 --> 01:53:03.747]  And what happened was their currency came under pressure and started to decline versus the dollar and got to levels we haven't seen since the 90s.
[01:53:03.827 --> 01:53:06.330]  About two and a half weeks ago, the U.S.
[01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:09.153]  dollar yen trade was at 160.
[01:53:09.714 --> 01:53:18.643]  Since they raised interest rates, we had unprecedented currency moves in Japan, and it went to 142, and it blew up the yen carry trade.
[01:53:19.505 --> 01:53:24.529]  What people need to understand is that Japanese banks had some of the largest one-day drops in over 30 years.
[01:53:24.969 --> 01:53:27.431]  So the Japanese banking system is being exposed.
[01:53:27.851 --> 01:53:36.658]  So what usually happens is the Fed lowers interest rates to pump the economy, get the animal spirits going.
[01:53:37.038 --> 01:53:38.879]  They usually leave them low for too long.
[01:53:38.919 --> 01:53:40.961]  We had a 14-year regime with low interest rates.
[01:53:41.101 --> 01:53:41.921]  Bubbles form.
[01:53:42.362 --> 01:53:46.185]  Then they raise interest rates when inflation shows its head like it did after COVID.
[01:53:46.885 --> 01:53:47.966]  And then something breaks.
[01:53:48.444 --> 01:53:52.746]  Japan is the first thing to break, and it's now the beginning of ripple effects.
[01:53:53.527 --> 01:54:00.791]  The real economy is bad, so the financial markets are starting to snip that out, and now we have unprecedented margin calls.
[01:54:00.831 --> 01:54:08.815]  So we're looking for a low, not a crash, but like a pullback of 20% or so into October in the U.S.
[01:54:08.835 --> 01:54:11.857]  stock market, which absolutely favors Trump.
[01:54:12.618 --> 01:54:20.927]  And the Federal Reserve is right now not doing anything about what happened in Japan, which they shouldn't because it's not it's not our economy and they're on hold.
[01:54:21.848 --> 01:54:28.354]  The knee jerk reaction in the markets was people predicted the Fed would be cutting interest rates before their next meeting.
[01:54:28.975 --> 01:54:30.477]  I think they're loathe to do that.
[01:54:30.637 --> 01:54:31.177]  They want to wait.
[01:54:31.498 --> 01:54:33.640]  They're saying they want to make way for more data.
[01:54:34.113 --> 01:54:36.294]  Unfortunately, I think they're behind the eight ball.
[01:54:36.314 --> 01:54:48.022]  And when they do start cutting, it's going to be unprecedented rate cuts, 100, 200 basis points very quickly, because the economy will be spiraling into a recession sometime after the election.
[01:54:48.582 --> 01:54:54.166]  The dangerous part about this is there'll be a rally, we think, into the election.
[01:54:54.186 --> 01:54:56.027]  It looks like Trump is going to be favored.
[01:54:56.708 --> 01:55:00.130]  And the stock market route into October definitely favors him.
[01:55:00.785 --> 01:55:00.905]  Wow.
[01:55:00.925 --> 01:55:02.045]  And that's what Trump's been warning of.
[01:55:02.065 --> 01:55:04.206]  He's gonna be handed a ticking time bomb.
[01:55:04.226 --> 01:55:04.306]  Yes.
[01:55:23.337 --> 01:55:23.838]  Absolutely.
[01:55:24.299 --> 01:55:25.400]  All right, Edward Dowd's our guest.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:35.095]  Let's come back, recap that, and then look forward into the different wildcards and people like Raskin, who I know is the highest level globalist planner, saying, oh, we're gonna have civil war.
[01:55:35.716 --> 01:55:36.897]  Well, my job's easy.
[01:55:37.478 --> 01:55:38.500]  I just have to interview
[01:55:39.321 --> 01:55:39.861]  We're good to go.
[01:56:01.092 --> 01:56:02.974]  The Deep State is going to try to kill him again.
[01:56:02.994 --> 01:56:04.515]  They've got more Black Swan events.
[01:56:04.935 --> 01:56:11.301]  We have Jamie Raskin, whose dad was a top communist strategist who wrote best-selling books that the globalists like Obama follow.
[01:56:11.901 --> 01:56:13.002]  So he's a top guy.
[01:56:13.142 --> 01:56:19.007]  Congressman Raskin was saying, we're just going to overthrow Trump 14th Amendment when he's elected.
[01:56:19.027 --> 01:56:21.429]  We're going to have civil unrest and civil war.
[01:56:22.472 --> 01:56:26.135]  Which again, they're going to beta test as racial, like you're seeing in England right now.
[01:56:27.156 --> 01:56:33.182]  And so yeah, we can look at trends all day long, except they've got wildcard events they're planning to bring in there.
[01:56:33.202 --> 01:56:37.966]  And then you've got Israel and Iran, you've got Russia, the situation in Ukraine.
[01:56:38.006 --> 01:56:39.748]  I mean, this is a crazy time to be alive.
[01:56:39.788 --> 01:56:46.774]  So Edward Dowd, starting over here, people can follow you on Getter at Edward Dowd, or just search your name on X, Edward Dowd.
[01:56:48.015 --> 01:56:49.556]  Yeah, basically, just to recap.
[01:56:59.494 --> 01:57:03.416]  The Federal Reserve cycle is one of booms and busts.
[01:57:04.197 --> 01:57:07.199]  We had unprecedented interest rate policy for 14 years.
[01:57:07.659 --> 01:57:09.480]  We got inflation after the COVID war.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:17.985]  And so the Federal Reserve went on the most unprecedented rate hike in terms of speed and magnitude we've ever seen.
[01:57:18.646 --> 01:57:19.946]  And now something is breaking.
[01:57:20.006 --> 01:57:22.348]  Every time the Fed raises interest rates, something breaks.
[01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:25.732]  The first thing to really break is in Japan.
[01:57:26.513 --> 01:57:33.363]  Japan has had zero interest rate policy for decades and bottom line, they finally had to raise interest rates
[01:57:33.905 --> 01:57:34.646]  We're good to go.
[01:57:58.126 --> 01:58:02.667]  And the most alarming thing is the Japanese balance sheets in their banks are horrendous.
[01:58:03.187 --> 01:58:06.127]  The banks' stocks in Japan imploded.
[01:58:06.227 --> 01:58:09.208]  We saw moves like we hadn't seen in over 30 years.
[01:58:09.728 --> 01:58:13.169]  And with this most recent rally that happened yesterday, the banks hardly bounced.
[01:58:13.249 --> 01:58:16.009]  So we just kicked off the ripple effects.
[01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:18.169]  It's going to take time to work through the system.
[01:58:18.730 --> 01:58:26.931]  We're looking for a stock market pullback, not a crash, into October, which will definitely favor Trump.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.362]  Uh, anywhere from 10 to 30%.
[01:58:29.442 --> 01:58:31.024]  Let's call 20.
[01:58:31.665 --> 01:58:34.749]  And then we'll get a rally once the election happens.
[01:58:34.829 --> 01:58:43.060]  But then after that, whoever takes the reins is going to inherit a weakening economy and an implosion.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.344]  And the Federal Reserve will be forced to lower interest rates at some point.
[01:58:47.714 --> 01:58:57.397]  I'm not a famous stockbroker like you, but when I saw Buffett dump 55% of Apple's number one stock in the world Friday, I said, look for a major crash or correction Monday.
[01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:57.997]  It happened.
[01:58:58.517 --> 01:59:03.539]  Was that Buffett knowing this was coming with Japan, or was that him triggering himself?
[01:59:05.253 --> 01:59:08.015]  There's a couple things you need to understand about someone with that much money.
[01:59:08.055 --> 01:59:08.916]  They have to be early.
[01:59:08.956 --> 01:59:10.357]  They can't time it.
[01:59:10.897 --> 01:59:14.359]  And he started accumulating cash the better part of a year and a half ago.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:21.724]  He sold all his time on semiconductor stock when he started to think war might be coming to that region of the world.
[01:59:22.165 --> 01:59:24.987]  So he's at the largest cash holding he's ever had.
[01:59:25.527 --> 01:59:28.149]  He owns 4% of the U.S.
[01:59:28.249 --> 01:59:31.251]  T-bill market, which is the safest instrument in the world.
[01:59:31.271 --> 01:59:31.992]  So $277 billion and growing, right?
[01:59:35.011 --> 01:59:35.391]  Correct.
[01:59:35.451 --> 01:59:36.771]  And it's in T-bills.
[01:59:37.552 --> 01:59:40.172]  And T-bills are the safest asset on the planet.
[01:59:40.352 --> 01:59:42.893]  They're yielding five and a half percent.
[01:59:44.133 --> 01:59:51.195]  And basically Warren Buffett is not waiting for an 8 percent pullback, which is what we just got.
[01:59:51.495 --> 01:59:57.016]  Warren Buffett's waiting for a 50 to 70 percent dry down in all markets for him to go back in.
[01:59:57.436 --> 01:59:59.177]  So he sees what we see.
[01:59:59.617 --> 02:00:00.257]  He's not dumb.
[02:00:00.857 --> 02:00:09.644]  And Warren Buffett had to be early, so now he's getting rid of some of his more favorite stocks like Apple, just reducing exposure, and he'll buy them back at lower prices.
[02:00:09.765 --> 02:00:19.873]  So, you know, if you want to do what the big boys do, and I'm not giving financial advice, put some of your assets in T-bills or cash or short-term instruments.
[02:00:20.053 --> 02:00:22.135]  And I've been saying that for the better part of a year and a half.
[02:00:23.736 --> 02:00:25.738]  Well, I mean, he called the top of the market, didn't he?
[02:00:28.284 --> 02:00:34.228]  He didn't call the top, he's been accumulating cash, but he certainly sped up his decision to start selling fast.
[02:00:34.268 --> 02:00:35.529]  He's seeing what we're seeing.
[02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:37.691]  Well sure, if he was $170 million a week ago and now he's $277, he's accelerating.
[02:00:37.711 --> 02:00:37.791]  Yes.
[02:00:47.061 --> 02:00:48.002]  You talk about ripple effects.
[02:00:48.042 --> 02:00:58.910]  I'm not, you know, an economist or a financial expert like you that's well known, but it seems to me we have weak banks around the world, all over the world, but here in the U.S., and already major regional bank stress.
[02:00:59.391 --> 02:01:09.659]  It seems to me like if they're invested in these stocks and that went down, and now the FDIC is talking about bail-ins, it seems like the next big contagion, or what would the next big contagion be?
[02:01:09.939 --> 02:01:11.000]  It seems like banks.
[02:01:13.066 --> 02:01:15.607]  Well, so the ripple effects are many.
[02:01:15.667 --> 02:01:17.268]  Let's just start with the first one.
[02:01:17.548 --> 02:01:26.632]  Volatility is a measure that every investment manager and trading and hedge fund uses to to manage risk.
[02:01:26.752 --> 02:01:31.014]  And volatility has been unprecedented lows coming into July.
[02:01:31.614 --> 02:01:35.257]  And as volatility rises, that means they have to reduce their position.
[02:01:35.317 --> 02:01:41.861]  So one of the ripple effects is people have to sell to get more right with the volatility in the market.
[02:01:41.901 --> 02:01:42.822]  It feeds on itself.
[02:01:42.902 --> 02:01:44.823]  It's called financial reflexivity.
[02:01:45.303 --> 02:01:47.405]  So a lot of financial assets start going down.
[02:01:47.865 --> 02:01:50.047]  This affects balance sheets, market to markets.
[02:01:50.547 --> 02:01:52.148]  And you're right about the regional banks.
[02:01:52.168 --> 02:01:54.109]  The regional banks were in trouble last year.
[02:01:54.129 --> 02:01:57.772]  Let's not forget, there was massive bank failure super quick.
[02:01:58.351 --> 02:02:01.334]  The decision was to juice the economy.
[02:02:01.394 --> 02:02:07.519]  The decision was to bail out banks with these bank term funding program loans and to slow it down.
[02:02:07.579 --> 02:02:12.183]  So they managed to put the finger in the dike, but at some point we're going to see
[02:02:12.878 --> 02:02:14.560]  Big, big pressure on regional banks.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:15.561]  They're upside down.
[02:02:15.581 --> 02:02:18.284]  Their assets and liabilities are offsides.
[02:02:18.924 --> 02:02:21.947]  And so, eventually, we'll see a lot of consolidation in the banks.
[02:02:22.468 --> 02:02:30.516]  And that'll start happening as the economy gets even weaker and weaker, and people are forced to, you know, shotgun marriages by the Fed.
[02:02:30.816 --> 02:02:33.659]  Usually, JP Morgan will buy a regional bank, whatever.
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.280]  That kind of thing.
[02:02:35.801 --> 02:02:37.562]  It's happening probably in the next 12 months.
[02:02:37.902 --> 02:02:56.414]  Ed, you've been nice answering my questions, but you're smarter than I am on this, so make the points you want to make, and I don't want to ask you about Black Swans, because I see people like Raskin, who I know from studying him, is like, he's in the Council of Global, he's in the main, he's a decision maker, they listen to him, and he's like, oh, we'll just have a civil war, 14th Amendment, we're gonna have civil war.
[02:02:56.714 --> 02:02:57.875]  He's not just saying that.
[02:02:58.795 --> 02:03:01.577]  I've already been on the receiving end of this guy and his Jan 6th committee.
[02:03:02.057 --> 02:03:03.218]  That is very chilling to me.
[02:03:03.258 --> 02:03:04.979]  But just first, what else is on your radar?
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:12.684]  Yeah, so let me give you some, these are pure speculations on my part, reading the tea leaves from what I see.
[02:03:12.964 --> 02:03:15.346]  So the Federal Reserve basically came out yesterday
[02:03:16.192 --> 02:03:18.212]  They're nonchalant about what happened in Japan.
[02:03:18.993 --> 02:03:23.714]  They're going to wait for more economic data before they do anything.
[02:03:23.854 --> 02:03:28.835]  So the question is, are they incompetent or do they know what they're doing?
[02:03:28.875 --> 02:03:31.576]  They shouldn't do anything, but they should be on high alert.
[02:03:31.596 --> 02:03:33.096]  They seem a little too nonchalant.
[02:03:34.096 --> 02:03:42.018]  You know, I think there's a lot of factions going on right now that are worried about the certain events that have occurred recently.
[02:03:43.198 --> 02:03:50.801]  Either the Federal Reserve is very incompetent or they're going to do nothing so that the financial markets pull back, and that helps Trump.
[02:03:50.841 --> 02:03:53.222]  So, you know, there's a 50-50 split.
[02:03:53.242 --> 02:03:56.923]  It's incompetence and or they're trying to help Trump.
[02:03:57.163 --> 02:04:00.044]  The bankers have decided they want to... And there's some evidence to that.
[02:04:00.064 --> 02:04:01.685]  I hate to say the Federal Reserve is helping Trump.
[02:04:01.705 --> 02:04:04.626]  There's some evidence they've been really fighting with Biden, the Federal Reserve has.
[02:04:06.628 --> 02:04:09.190]  They've been very critical of the spending.
[02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:11.211]  They've been very critical of the spending.
[02:04:12.192 --> 02:04:15.154]  That's something that they have talked about.
[02:04:16.095 --> 02:04:22.199]  They say, we've done what we can do, but the spending side of the equation is something we don't control.
[02:04:22.399 --> 02:04:28.544]  And I think they know if we look out five, ten years, we won't be able to
[02:04:29.404 --> 02:04:35.669]  You know, the interest rate accumulation from the deficit will be the biggest part of our budget, and that's when we get into trouble.
[02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:37.651]  So I think they've had enough.
[02:04:38.051 --> 02:04:45.857]  Personally, I think they've had enough of this regime, and they want to see what happens in the next regime, which would be Trump, is my guess.
[02:04:45.877 --> 02:04:47.919]  But this is pure speculation on my part.
[02:04:48.579 --> 02:04:51.901]  And again, I agree, and the Federal Reserve is not everything.
[02:04:52.281 --> 02:04:54.943]  You've got the Democrat Party Justice Department.
[02:04:55.023 --> 02:04:56.804]  They're their own faction that's been in control of all.
[02:04:56.824 --> 02:04:57.964]  They think they're the total boss.
[02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.585]  They're going to try to kill Trump again.
[02:04:59.605 --> 02:05:00.686]  I mean, that is an easy bet.
[02:05:03.367 --> 02:05:06.849]  I'm of the opinion there'll be another attempt, but let's hope we're wrong.
[02:05:06.869 --> 02:05:08.650]  This is one prediction I want to be wrong on.
[02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:10.591]  I don't want to see that come true.
[02:05:11.451 --> 02:05:13.092]  Some other things I'd like to point out.
[02:05:13.232 --> 02:05:17.755]  I was talking to a very smart woman who has been saying for a couple of weeks now,
[02:05:18.587 --> 02:05:28.235]  She thinks they're going to, after the DNC convention, get rid of Kamala and try to, I don't know how this works, but she thinks Michelle is on deck.
[02:05:28.736 --> 02:05:30.557]  And with this VP pick that
[02:05:32.537 --> 02:05:49.644]  Kamala May today and the fact that Axelrod came out, you know, he's a Democratic operative, said that there's a rational exuberance in the Democratic Party right now and that Trump is ahead in his... And they leaked, and they leaked that they kicked her out of a war meeting.
[02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:51.164]  Why would they?
[02:05:51.484 --> 02:05:52.045]  That's leaked.
[02:05:52.225 --> 02:05:53.265]  That's in mainstream news.
[02:05:53.365 --> 02:05:56.026]  Why would they leak they kicked her out because she was an idiot in a military meeting?
[02:05:56.366 --> 02:05:57.147]  That's to undermine her.
[02:05:57.187 --> 02:05:57.667]  I agree with you.
[02:05:59.288 --> 02:06:00.610]  So this is pure speculation.
[02:06:00.650 --> 02:06:02.232]  There's a chance to do a swap out.
[02:06:03.273 --> 02:06:09.881]  I think the unprecedented media propaganda campaign we've seen is failing in real time.
[02:06:10.341 --> 02:06:15.287]  And Axelrod just told you, hey guys, let's not get too excited here.
[02:06:16.065 --> 02:06:17.245]  And so we'll see.
[02:06:17.385 --> 02:06:21.346]  I mean, I hope they stick with Kamala personally.
[02:06:21.446 --> 02:06:30.748]  I think as we get closer to the election, it'll become apparent to, you know, those who are excited about her in the Democratic Party that they may have made a mistake.
[02:06:31.008 --> 02:06:32.629]  So it's the fight for the Democrats.
[02:06:32.649 --> 02:06:38.150]  Yeah, but the Democrats wouldn't post on their official site this photo of her with Michelle signs.
[02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:39.210]  That's a message.
[02:06:40.776 --> 02:06:41.717]  There's something going on.
[02:06:41.977 --> 02:06:43.478]  And again, you and I are analysts.
[02:06:43.538 --> 02:06:44.739]  We're trying to predict the future.
[02:06:44.779 --> 02:06:46.040]  These are speculations.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:54.765]  And, you know, I got to be honest, since July 13th, things have been so insane.
[02:06:54.785 --> 02:06:57.467]  I've never seen a news cycle like we've seen during the summer.
[02:06:57.807 --> 02:06:59.408]  I mean, it's just unprecedented.
[02:06:59.889 --> 02:07:03.151]  We have war in the Mideast getting ready to kick off at any moment.
[02:07:03.581 --> 02:07:05.344]  We have financial troubles brewing.
[02:07:06.105 --> 02:07:07.587]  We have assassination attempts.
[02:07:08.068 --> 02:07:11.093]  And then this Raskin thing that you've uncovered, I watched the video.
[02:07:11.573 --> 02:07:12.855]  That is very scary.
[02:07:13.396 --> 02:07:18.444]  And when they say that there are going to be mobs of anti-Trump people after the election,
[02:07:19.717 --> 02:07:23.339]  You know, most people do not self-organize.
[02:07:23.359 --> 02:07:26.642]  So this will be ginned up, in my humble opinion.
[02:07:26.942 --> 02:07:29.564]  And if they try that, we're in scary times.
[02:07:29.784 --> 02:07:31.926]  I mean, again, you and I talked several weeks ago.
[02:07:31.946 --> 02:07:34.208]  This is the most dangerous time in U.S.
[02:07:34.248 --> 02:07:35.348]  history we've ever seen.
[02:07:35.989 --> 02:07:40.813]  No, I agree, but I think what you just said, quantify this, is the globalists aren't in control.
[02:07:41.373 --> 02:07:42.234]  Nobody's in control.
[02:07:42.534 --> 02:07:43.815]  Things are out of control right now.
[02:07:43.855 --> 02:07:47.638]  There's no way to predict what's going to happen because everything's out of control, which makes it even more dangerous.
[02:07:48.902 --> 02:07:49.263]  Correct.
[02:07:49.323 --> 02:07:51.747]  And there's different factions and different power pockets.
[02:07:52.288 --> 02:07:53.450]  They're not all aligned.
[02:07:54.111 --> 02:07:56.015]  And I personally think.
[02:07:56.807 --> 02:08:09.392]  Ever since the assassination attempt on Trump, a lot of people, and also the convictions in New York, a lot of billionaire oligarchs are starting to get nervous that, hey, I'm next.
[02:08:09.812 --> 02:08:15.314]  So you're seeing a lot of very rich people run into the Trump camp, worried about how crazy it's gotten.
[02:08:15.434 --> 02:08:21.657]  They're like, you know, they embraced the woke mechanisms and they thought it was great, you know, a few people divided and asleep.
[02:08:28.319 --> 02:08:28.860]  Exactly.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:36.843]  As big a sociopath as a lot of these billionaires are, they're now having sympathy and empathy seeing what's happening to Trump because empathy folks in mammals
[02:08:37.723 --> 02:08:38.823]  It's not a sign of weakness.
[02:08:38.903 --> 02:08:40.924]  It's that you understand that can happen to you, too.
[02:08:41.344 --> 02:08:45.045]  And so people are watching Trump have all his rights taken away, and they're like, well, wait a minute.
[02:08:45.065 --> 02:08:45.785]  None of us are safe.
[02:08:45.805 --> 02:08:51.286]  I mean, the due process was put in there by people that weren't sweet cupcakes, folks.
[02:08:51.326 --> 02:08:53.527]  They had been robbed over and over again and been through wars.
[02:08:53.827 --> 02:08:56.447]  They said, let's build a stable system where we're basically all safe.
[02:08:56.827 --> 02:08:58.068]  Instead, that's all being overturned.
[02:08:58.108 --> 02:08:59.568]  And that's what the left doesn't get.
[02:08:59.848 --> 02:09:02.289]  They brought us into a zone of lawlessness.
[02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:04.009]  That is dangerous for everybody.
[02:09:05.526 --> 02:09:13.690]  Yeah, this unprecedented lawlessness is starting to wake up even those who thought they could make money off of it.
[02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:22.035]  And, you know, nothing motivates a billionaire more than worrying about the fact that their money might be taken from them.
[02:09:22.095 --> 02:09:27.317]  And that was a real thing that occurred when Trump got convicted because it was a kangaroo court.
[02:09:27.458 --> 02:09:29.058]  It was no due process.
[02:09:29.118 --> 02:09:29.979]  Trumped up charges.
[02:09:30.686 --> 02:09:43.055]  Even people in finance who've looked at some of these charges, like, all he did was take out a loan, the bank did their own work, and they claim he defrauded the bank, even though the bank never sued for anything.
[02:09:43.795 --> 02:09:44.876]  This is financial law.
[02:09:44.896 --> 02:09:46.357]  Well, look at the billion and a half on me.
[02:09:46.417 --> 02:09:53.162]  They know I didn't have anything near that, but they did it as a message, which was a message that was received by the real billionaires.
[02:09:53.202 --> 02:09:58.426]  Like, that was a message, we can take everything from anybody we want, but now, like, oh, we got the message.
[02:09:59.793 --> 02:09:59.993]  Yeah.
[02:10:00.754 --> 02:10:03.716]  And so there's a lot of factions, a lot of things going on.
[02:10:03.756 --> 02:10:07.499]  Even Zuckerberg came out and said, yeah, I'm not I'm not getting involved.
[02:10:07.559 --> 02:10:08.680]  And, you know, he's nervous.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:09.701]  Everyone's nervous.
[02:10:09.741 --> 02:10:13.024]  That was super excited about, you know,
[02:10:13.729 --> 02:10:15.671]  What they thought was going to unfold after COVID.
[02:10:16.091 --> 02:10:25.100]  And the good news is the COVID mandates, the COVID vaccine program, that whole control grid system wasn't able to be implemented.
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:33.607]  So now they're trying to implement it, at least in the UK, it looks like they want to implement the digital ID now by using these UK riots.
[02:10:33.767 --> 02:10:35.809]  They're using whatever excuse they can use.
[02:10:35.829 --> 02:10:37.091]  They want digital IDs.
[02:10:37.171 --> 02:10:38.011]  They want CBDCs.
[02:10:39.028 --> 02:10:41.969]  They want mass vaccination programs to control the population.
[02:10:42.369 --> 02:10:45.891]  They keep trying to introduce it under different, uh, different crises.
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:15.204]  Well, some people, not everybody, you know, got the memo and is involved, you know, in a plan.
[02:11:15.324 --> 02:11:17.066]  They were incentivized to go along with it.
[02:11:17.106 --> 02:11:21.370]  So, I don't, honestly, I don't think Zuckerberg is in the know.
[02:11:21.690 --> 02:11:22.210]  No, you're right.
[02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:24.973]  He piles onto a trend and he finds out late.
[02:11:26.109 --> 02:11:29.610]  Yeah, so he piled on to a trend, and now he's like, Retro, what have I done?
[02:11:29.630 --> 02:11:30.131]  I'm out.
[02:11:30.211 --> 02:11:31.211]  This is getting kooky.
[02:11:31.411 --> 02:11:33.112]  And this is what's happened, one by one.
[02:11:34.172 --> 02:11:38.254]  Some of these minions who don't know they're minions are opting out, which is good.
[02:11:38.774 --> 02:11:39.994]  I mean, this is what we needed to see.
[02:11:40.074 --> 02:11:45.396]  Well, don't you think Musk, who really wasn't a minion, got the memo a few years ago and made his turn?
[02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:49.378]  I saw that as the establishment figuring out, we should not go down this road.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:58.426]  Well, you know, I said years ago, if you're a billionaire and you didn't get the memo not to take the vaccine, you're not in the club.
[02:11:59.127 --> 02:12:00.668]  And Elon took the vaccine.
[02:12:01.489 --> 02:12:05.373]  And almost killed his brother and made a bunch of his engineers sick.
[02:12:05.653 --> 02:12:07.595]  And he actually said, I didn't get a memo.
[02:12:07.635 --> 02:12:08.956]  They're cutting my son's dick off.
[02:12:09.056 --> 02:12:09.696]  I didn't get a memo.
[02:12:09.796 --> 02:12:10.397]  I got sick.
[02:12:10.517 --> 02:12:10.998]  Exactly.
[02:12:11.058 --> 02:12:12.839]  He was like, you just nailed it.
[02:12:12.859 --> 02:12:13.500]  He didn't get the memo.
[02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:18.012]  Yep, so if you didn't get the memo not to take the vaccine, you're not in the club.
[02:12:18.252 --> 02:12:23.515]  And I know, I've heard word of mouth, some people would be shocked and get the memo.
[02:12:23.955 --> 02:12:24.936]  And they're pests.
[02:12:25.516 --> 02:12:26.637]  A lot of these people are pests.
[02:12:27.137 --> 02:12:30.599]  And this is what we see.
[02:12:30.619 --> 02:12:34.601]  We're starting to see the preying of the edges of the control system.
[02:12:34.661 --> 02:12:37.143]  Again, most of these people didn't know they were in a control system.
[02:12:37.403 --> 02:12:38.604]  They were unwitting idiots.
[02:12:39.004 --> 02:12:42.186]  But now we're starting to see people resist because they're starting to see the whole picture.
[02:12:42.746 --> 02:12:44.948]  And I come back to this.
[02:12:45.769 --> 02:12:55.597]  When the vaccine was introduced, they would have been better off making it a saline solution, and they would have been able to get everybody into their control system.
[02:12:55.617 --> 02:12:58.440]  But for some reason, the decision was made, let's kill lots of people.
[02:12:59.542 --> 02:13:05.667]  And so that got exposed, and that showed how evil the system is.
[02:13:06.228 --> 02:13:07.949]  And the system was bearing no one.
[02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:09.110]  No, no, no, I agree.
[02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:09.550]  I agree.
[02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:12.793]  If they came out with a placebo and were the saviors, they'd have got everything.
[02:13:13.053 --> 02:13:21.260]  But they were so greedy for the hospital stocks and drug companies to make money on the drugs to treat all the heart attacks and everything, that they screwed the pooch.
[02:13:22.741 --> 02:13:23.682]  Yeah, they screwed the pooch.
[02:13:24.215 --> 02:13:26.196]  It showed up in numbers.
[02:13:26.216 --> 02:13:26.917]  They couldn't hide it.
[02:13:26.937 --> 02:13:28.618]  They couldn't hide it in insurance results.
[02:13:28.698 --> 02:13:31.319]  It couldn't hide it in the Elkhoz mortality.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:33.581]  It couldn't hide it in the disability numbers.
[02:13:33.981 --> 02:13:34.621]  And here we are.
[02:13:35.042 --> 02:13:36.923]  And the good news is word of mouth has spread.
[02:13:37.423 --> 02:13:43.787]  Most people know the vaccine's a joke and dangerous, even though the mainstream media hasn't even touched this topic.
[02:13:44.387 --> 02:13:50.869]  Obviously, you know, I'd love for Trump to talk about this at some point, but, you know, I can't have everything.
[02:13:50.969 --> 02:13:51.909]  That's my next question.
[02:13:52.089 --> 02:13:52.630]  You read my mind.
[02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:54.270]  What should Trump do?
[02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:57.211]  I mean, he should get ahead of this Raskin comic, because that's a real planner.
[02:13:57.711 --> 02:14:05.394]  They're going to remove him, 14th Amendment, cause a civil war, play the clip, say he's crazy, come out and say, clearly, you know, they stood down, tried to get him killed.
[02:14:05.434 --> 02:14:06.094]  That's now known.
[02:14:06.614 --> 02:14:07.874]  Trump needs to get more aggressive.
[02:14:09.635 --> 02:14:10.975]  Yeah, Trump needs to get more aggressive.
[02:14:11.035 --> 02:14:13.216]  And look, I think the American people,
[02:14:13.963 --> 02:14:20.169]  I would love to hear a statement from him saying that, hey, take responsibility.
[02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:23.372]  Say, I was duped, but it's my responsibility.
[02:14:24.153 --> 02:14:24.774]  I was wrong.
[02:14:24.794 --> 02:14:26.776]  We need to pull this vaccine.
[02:14:26.796 --> 02:14:29.098]  We need to start investigating how this happened.
[02:14:29.688 --> 02:14:34.691]  He would get a lot of credit for that, and it's a big wedge issue right now, even though it's not talked about.
[02:14:34.711 --> 02:14:40.113]  The reason why JFK is doing so well is because of this issue.
[02:14:40.453 --> 02:14:44.075]  Trump could heal and take a lot of voters.
[02:14:44.115 --> 02:14:48.057]  And notice in the JFK call that leaked three weeks ago, Trump's admitting the vaccine was bad.
[02:14:49.078 --> 02:14:49.358]  Yeah.
[02:14:49.858 --> 02:14:52.719]  So he needs to publicly step away from it.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.862]  Unfortunately, I don't think that's in the cards, and he's surrounded by people who are telling him not to do that.
[02:14:58.513 --> 02:15:01.095]  Well, in closing, what else is on your radar, Edward Dowd?
[02:15:03.877 --> 02:15:06.640]  Like you said, I think we're, what, 89, 90 days out?
[02:15:07.861 --> 02:15:11.864]  I just pray that we don't get a suitcase nuke.
[02:15:11.924 --> 02:15:13.405]  We don't get anything crazy.
[02:15:13.926 --> 02:15:15.827]  I hope we are able to avoid war.
[02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:21.672]  But given what I'm seeing, it seems to me we're, you know,
[02:15:23.171 --> 02:15:24.331]  It's called flooding the zone.
[02:15:24.711 --> 02:15:33.254]  We could get a war, financial turbulence, them attempting to steal the election, race riots, civil war talk.
[02:15:33.414 --> 02:15:44.016]  I mean, the problem I have is that black swan events, whether they're coincidences or manufactured, are definitely in the offing.
[02:15:44.216 --> 02:15:46.457]  And black swans give birth to black swans.
[02:15:47.457 --> 02:15:47.837]  Correct.
[02:15:48.037 --> 02:15:51.338]  Unintended consequences, daisy chain effects that no one foresees.
[02:15:51.963 --> 02:15:59.151]  That's one of the things that these planners never do the knock-on effects because they're not critical thinkers.
[02:15:59.592 --> 02:16:01.794]  They're just very short-sighted.
[02:16:01.814 --> 02:16:04.637]  They're only one or second order, which I don't understand.
[02:16:06.539 --> 02:16:08.441]  Right.
[02:16:08.642 --> 02:16:10.063]  They don't even know how to figure it out.
[02:16:11.184 --> 02:16:12.686]  They just go, I'll make money on this.
[02:16:12.826 --> 02:16:13.147]  Do it.
[02:16:14.602 --> 02:16:15.283]  That's correct.
[02:16:15.623 --> 02:16:16.483]  I'll make money on this.
[02:16:16.523 --> 02:16:17.084]  Let's do it.
[02:16:17.484 --> 02:16:18.745]  I'll retain power.
[02:16:18.965 --> 02:16:19.486]  Let's do it.
[02:16:19.546 --> 02:16:20.967]  But they don't realize the blowback.
[02:16:22.308 --> 02:16:24.930]  These people don't have people that can war game efficiently.
[02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.891]  I don't understand what they're doing.
[02:16:28.353 --> 02:16:29.393]  Well, that's part of their power.
[02:16:29.413 --> 02:16:34.077]  Because in a more stable world, they can pig-headedly just take over because they weren't in such a volatile world.
[02:16:34.097 --> 02:16:38.260]  But once you get in an endgame like this, any wrong move, it just gets out of control.
[02:16:42.644 --> 02:16:44.025]  We have no shortage of chaos.
[02:16:44.767 --> 02:16:48.769]  If there was a financial instrument called chaos, I would be long chaos.
[02:16:49.149 --> 02:16:52.071]  Chaos is all we're going to see in the next 90 days.
[02:16:52.931 --> 02:16:56.733]  And if I have one prediction to make, that's it.
[02:16:57.033 --> 02:16:57.593]  Bar none.
[02:16:58.214 --> 02:17:00.475]  We're going to see chaos going forward.
[02:17:01.375 --> 02:17:01.935]  Absolutely.
[02:17:02.015 --> 02:17:03.656]  Nothing breeds chaos like chaos.
[02:17:03.696 --> 02:17:04.877]  Nothing breeds failure like failure.
[02:17:04.897 --> 02:17:06.217]  Nothing breeds success like success.
[02:17:06.317 --> 02:17:08.399]  We are in the age of chaos.
[02:17:08.519 --> 02:17:10.119]  Edward Dowd, thank you so much for the time.
[02:17:10.379 --> 02:17:13.241]  People should follow you on X. Any other websites people should check out?
[02:17:14.571 --> 02:17:16.112]  Financetechnologies.com.
[02:17:16.132 --> 02:17:18.554]  We have all the vaccine research there.
[02:17:18.714 --> 02:17:23.037]  It's spelled with a PH instead of an F. And one quick last message.
[02:17:23.618 --> 02:17:26.580]  You know, as this craziness unfolds, remain calm.
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.502]  Don't get in a state of fear or terror or anger.
[02:17:30.023 --> 02:17:32.305]  Keep your critical thinking skills on board.
[02:17:32.365 --> 02:17:33.766]  Pray to God and you'll be fine.
[02:17:33.806 --> 02:17:37.909]  Because once you get in an emotional state, you'll make bad decisions.
[02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:39.310]  Very well said.
[02:17:39.330 --> 02:17:39.930]  Talk to you soon.
[02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:40.471]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:17:41.425 --> 02:17:41.605]  Okay.
[02:17:41.685 --> 02:17:42.606]  All right.
[02:17:42.786 --> 02:17:48.971]  Major insider with the Russians, the Bilderberg Group, the EU, Daniel Estelan knows his stuff.
[02:17:50.372 --> 02:17:52.734]  He is coming up after this quick break.
[02:17:52.814 --> 02:17:59.179]  And then Roger Stone on Kamala Harris's, that means Obama's, that means
[02:18:00.751 --> 02:18:01.613]  Eric Holder's pick.
[02:18:02.354 --> 02:18:03.196]  So critical!
[02:18:03.216 --> 02:18:05.380]  I'm going into the fourth hour today.
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:06.182]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:06.202 --> 02:18:11.151]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:18:11.211 --> 02:18:11.672]  Stay with us.
[02:18:12.748 --> 02:18:16.731]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:19.533]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:18:19.553 --> 02:18:26.219]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:18:26.739 --> 02:18:31.383]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:18:32.063 --> 02:18:43.636]  We were basically sabotaged, and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:18:44.237 --> 02:18:46.039]  But by the grace of God, years ago,
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:53.001]  We set up a backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:18:53.441 --> 02:19:02.584]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled, and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:19:02.924 --> 02:19:03.924]  They're all top of the line.
[02:19:03.964 --> 02:19:04.984]  They're already best sellers.
[02:19:05.284 --> 02:19:08.885]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names.
[02:19:09.125 --> 02:19:10.745]  But they are all the very best.
[02:19:11.205 --> 02:19:13.306]  So this line is called InfoWars MD.
[02:19:14.335 --> 02:19:16.056]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:19:16.436 --> 02:19:20.057]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:19:20.478 --> 02:19:23.039]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:19:23.539 --> 02:19:26.440]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:28.661]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:19:28.681 --> 02:19:30.442]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[02:19:30.782 --> 02:19:32.903]  It is the exact same formula.
[02:19:33.183 --> 02:19:34.724]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[02:19:35.004 --> 02:19:36.205]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[02:19:36.485 --> 02:19:39.907]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[02:19:39.947 --> 02:19:44.950]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:47.731]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[02:19:47.751 --> 02:19:53.815]  You want to check out the line of InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:19:54.435 --> 02:19:56.395]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:19:56.495 --> 02:19:57.696]  I need you to take action.
[02:19:57.996 --> 02:19:59.136]  You will love these products.
[02:19:59.376 --> 02:20:00.716]  They work really, really good.
[02:20:00.956 --> 02:20:10.959]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWarsMD label.
[02:20:11.159 --> 02:20:11.979]  Thank you for your support.
[02:20:12.159 --> 02:20:17.980]  All right, more than two weeks ago, Roger Stone predicted who they would be picking as the VP.
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.701]  He is absolutely horrible, evil globalist.
[02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:27.077]  He'll be joining us in 30 minutes, but right now, Daniel Esselstyn, who I've known...
[02:20:28.436 --> 02:20:28.776]  We're good.
[02:20:58.336 --> 02:20:58.558]  We're good.
[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:06.226]  We are in a super storm of all these converging accelerations of technology and a population and culture.
[02:21:07.306 --> 02:21:13.352]  I cannot stress to everybody how extremely dangerous the times are, but there's also a lot of good things happening as well.
[02:21:13.672 --> 02:21:16.134]  So Daniel Esselin, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:21:16.154 --> 02:21:22.579]  We'll put your websites up on screen, Esselin Media, Esselin.media, and Esselin VZ or any other sites.
[02:21:22.599 --> 02:21:24.601]  We've got a lot of sites, whichever ones you want up.
[02:21:25.221 --> 02:21:28.164]  But where should we start right now with all the craziness in our world?
[02:21:29.238 --> 02:21:31.259]  I think Israel and Iran is a pretty good point.
[02:21:32.579 --> 02:21:34.479]  I mean, Israel is not crazy enough.
[02:21:34.499 --> 02:21:37.260]  People say to you, so what do you think, we're going to go into a third world war?
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:39.621]  It's some kind of a celebration.
[02:21:39.641 --> 02:21:43.962]  People would say, do you understand what the third world war might entail?
[02:21:45.282 --> 02:21:51.124]  It might entail a thermonuclear war, which means that four or five billion people will be eliminated immediately.
[02:21:51.864 --> 02:21:53.385]  Which is, of course, the elite would like that.
[02:21:54.045 --> 02:21:56.245]  Because you have a four quadrillion dollar debt, Alex.
[02:21:57.346 --> 02:21:58.566]  You need to somehow write it off.
[02:21:59.548 --> 02:22:02.029]  They keep calling aliens to come down and see us.
[02:22:02.910 --> 02:22:03.490]  They're not there.
[02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:08.893]  So they need to, you know, some kind of a force majeure to be able to write off debts and responsibility.
[02:22:08.913 --> 02:22:16.358]  And if you actually kill 3, 4, 5 billion people as a result of a thermonuclear war, get people, you know, big war, not little tiny, little piddly little war.
[02:22:16.858 --> 02:22:19.620]  Yeah, that's a perfect way to end the giant Ponzi scheme.
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:20.420]  It's coming to an end.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:23.822]  So as horrible as it sounds, they admittedly want a great reset.
[02:22:24.898 --> 02:22:27.879]  They want a great reset and a great reset and a great thermonuclear war.
[02:22:28.459 --> 02:22:29.239]  Again, they've been trying.
[02:22:29.259 --> 02:22:31.019]  They're pushing Israel-Palestine.
[02:22:31.399 --> 02:22:35.540]  They're pushing Russia-Ukraine.
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:37.421]  They're pushing things in South America.
[02:22:37.741 --> 02:22:39.281]  You know, Africa is coming to the fore.
[02:22:39.341 --> 02:22:41.061]  You have Taiwan and China.
[02:22:41.522 --> 02:22:43.902]  But people just don't want a big thermonuclear war.
[02:22:44.942 --> 02:22:47.843]  Now, my question is, is Israel crazy enough to go to war with Iran?
[02:22:49.295 --> 02:22:54.977]  Israel doesn't have the military technical potential to even think about an armed conflict with Iran.
[02:22:55.277 --> 02:22:57.757]  I know there's a lot of crazy kooks in Israel who want war.
[02:22:57.918 --> 02:22:59.558]  No, no, they intend to suck us in.
[02:23:00.918 --> 02:23:03.019]  Well, Israel's population is 9 million people.
[02:23:03.039 --> 02:23:07.200]  25% of that, they're Arabs, and for the most part, they hate Israel.
[02:23:08.281 --> 02:23:10.721]  Against Iran's 80 million population.
[02:23:11.601 --> 02:23:16.443]  They don't have the bodies to go to war, but again, this is the kind of war that Netanyahu needs.
[02:23:17.262 --> 02:23:18.883]  Israel as a nation state doesn't need it.
[02:23:19.163 --> 02:23:21.264]  Netanyahu needs this war to stay out of prison.
[02:23:22.225 --> 02:23:32.030]  Now Alex, about 12 or 15 years ago, I can't exactly remember, there's a report, you know, out of Pentagon on how to turn Iran into a subservient lab dog of the West.
[02:23:32.450 --> 02:23:42.235]  And one of the key conclusions of the report, in order to take over Iran, a strong, well-equipped and very large ground military contingent is required.
[02:23:43.291 --> 02:23:50.637]  Also, the bottom line is that the carpet bombing, as they said, the conclusions they reached in that report, okay, will help, but it's not going to have much of an effect.
[02:23:50.997 --> 02:23:51.498]  Why not?
[02:23:52.779 --> 02:23:59.264]  There are many reasons, but one of the most important reasons is that Iran has wasted no time since the 1979 revolution.
[02:23:59.304 --> 02:24:02.407]  It has built up many underground military bases.
[02:24:03.287 --> 02:24:09.012]  And so the conclusion of the Pentagon report back 15 years ago, they postponed the attack on Iran indefinitely.
[02:24:09.688 --> 02:24:18.284]  And every time the United States or Israel threatens regime change or some color revolution, the Iranians whisper in their ear, try it!
[02:24:18.991 --> 02:24:25.274]  And let me just stop you.
[02:24:25.454 --> 02:24:30.416]  I have a family member that was a retired military officer.
[02:24:31.456 --> 02:24:34.497]  He was the adjunct to one of the top guys in the Middle East, top general.
[02:24:34.517 --> 02:24:40.760]  He didn't tell me he didn't classify, but he told me 15 years ago, I've told him since then, separate from that report, he said, look, we war-gamed Iran.
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:42.880]  They already had nukes back then, folks.
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:46.881]  He said, we go to war with them, it shuts down the world economy, we can't do it.
[02:24:47.261 --> 02:24:48.722]  The liberals aren't good.
[02:24:48.782 --> 02:24:50.202]  Biden and Obama aren't good.
[02:24:50.502 --> 02:24:51.743]  They just know they can't win it.
[02:24:52.023 --> 02:24:53.923]  Then you've got crazy neocons that think they can't.
[02:24:53.963 --> 02:24:54.763]  Explain that to people.
[02:24:55.624 --> 02:24:59.444]  Well, Iran in the last 15 years has approved tenfold the production of their own weapons.
[02:25:00.365 --> 02:25:02.545]  And we're seeing it in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
[02:25:02.585 --> 02:25:06.686]  Russia, 60 years ago, we went into space first.
[02:25:06.966 --> 02:25:09.427]  Today we're buying drones from the Iranian mullahs.
[02:25:10.402 --> 02:25:13.284]  Iran's mobilization resource is about 2 million people.
[02:25:13.544 --> 02:25:15.826]  That's their standing army, Alex, in a drop of a hat.
[02:25:16.827 --> 02:25:20.269]  And the people of Iran, they're patriotic, although they're very critical of their leadership.
[02:25:20.989 --> 02:25:32.577]  And unlike the French, or the Americans, or the Europeans, Iranians, despite cheap Western propaganda, have the right to participate in protest rallies without asking permission from the government and local authorities.
[02:25:32.918 --> 02:25:37.461]  And then, if push comes to shove, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini,
[02:25:38.484 --> 02:25:47.927]  He steps in and becomes the arbiter between the people and the government, and if the people are right and the government is wrong, the Supreme Leader can tell the government they are wrong, and they should reconsider the action.
[02:25:48.768 --> 02:25:53.689]  And by the way, speaking of intelligence, Iranian intelligence is considered one of the best in the world.
[02:25:53.729 --> 02:25:59.932]  They're not better than the Russians, they're not better than the Americans, they're not better than the British or the Israelis, but they're one of the top in the world.
[02:25:59.972 --> 02:26:00.912]  Top five, top six.
[02:26:01.652 --> 02:26:03.713]  And at the same time, it's now public knowledge.
[02:26:04.631 --> 02:26:18.885]  Now, during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, 1980 to 1988, Israeli companies supplied military optics to the Iranian armed forces through third companies, such as the Ariban Menashe, for example.
[02:26:19.626 --> 02:26:21.087]  And there's another important reason.
[02:26:21.147 --> 02:26:22.529]  A lot of people don't really understand.
[02:26:23.049 --> 02:26:24.851]  They think it's some kind of a religious thing.
[02:26:25.467 --> 02:26:26.308]  It's a democracy.
[02:26:26.328 --> 02:26:27.328]  It's not about that at all.
[02:26:27.749 --> 02:26:30.691]  One of the most important reasons that nobody's talking about.
[02:26:31.251 --> 02:26:34.273]  I went online just before, you know, I joined your show.
[02:26:34.734 --> 02:26:37.115]  I wanted to see who's talking about this particular point.
[02:26:37.656 --> 02:26:41.258]  The reason, the real reason why Iran is in the elite's crosshair.
[02:26:41.799 --> 02:26:44.581]  There is something called the North-South Corridor.
[02:26:45.681 --> 02:26:46.442]  Now what is that?
[02:26:46.882 --> 02:26:50.124]  It's the International North-South Transport Corridor.
[02:26:50.365 --> 02:26:52.166]  It's a multi-model network.
[02:26:52.831 --> 02:27:04.200]  Of over 7,000 kilometers, that's about what, 5,000 miles, of sea and rail and land routes for the transport of goods between India and Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe.
[02:27:05.021 --> 02:27:11.927]  And it's a project of the utmost importance for the future of Iran, perhaps even more important than China's Silk Road to the Chinese.
[02:27:12.787 --> 02:27:15.409]  Because for Iran, the South-North Corridor is a lifeline.
[02:27:17.151 --> 02:27:18.632]  Now let's talk about Iran and Israel.
[02:27:18.652 --> 02:27:19.553]  For the longest time,
[02:27:20.623 --> 02:27:26.665]  These two countries have been declaring, you know, opposite one another and threatening each other in many different ways.
[02:27:27.586 --> 02:27:30.107]  Iran says there should be no such thing as the State of Israel.
[02:27:30.327 --> 02:27:32.348]  Now, mainstream media report this.
[02:27:32.668 --> 02:27:34.228]  Iran wishes death to Israel.
[02:27:34.449 --> 02:27:35.989]  They're not saying kill the Jews.
[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:40.431]  Okay, I'm not an apologist for Iran, but they're not saying that.
[02:27:40.471 --> 02:27:41.511]  They've never said that.
[02:27:42.052 --> 02:27:45.873]  The government never said, let's kill the Jews, as too many people mistakenly believe.
[02:27:46.053 --> 02:27:47.514]  What they're saying in the State of Israel
[02:27:48.786 --> 02:27:50.146]  It's a wrong name for the state.
[02:27:50.467 --> 02:27:53.828]  Again, if you kind of, you know, I always quote Thomas's theorem.
[02:27:54.388 --> 02:27:58.009]  If people define situation as real, they're real in their consequences.
[02:27:58.749 --> 02:28:07.072]  And the Iranians have a very profound appreciation of historical memory, like the Americans, who can barely, you know, call their country history.
[02:28:07.352 --> 02:28:09.012]  You've only been around for 200 some years.
[02:28:09.873 --> 02:28:12.574]  We're talking about civilizations which have been around for millennia.
[02:28:12.614 --> 02:28:13.214]  Four thousand.
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:21.925]  And so for Iran, the events today, a decade ago, a century ago, two centuries ago, a thousand years ago, is equally relevant.
[02:28:22.685 --> 02:28:24.746]  These are the people of very long memories.
[02:28:25.027 --> 02:28:33.072]  And so the Iranian people are very awake, they're very active, they're very creative, a very long tradition that they've adhered to all their lives.
[02:28:33.992 --> 02:28:40.156]  If you look, for example, at the writings of the Old Testament, which is reflected both in the Bible and the Holy Book of the Jews, the Tanakh,
[02:28:40.794 --> 02:28:49.517]  When Moses brought the Jews from the Egyptian captivity to the Holy Land, his brother Aaron spoke for him since Moses, as we know, had a stutter.
[02:28:50.257 --> 02:28:52.738]  And this Aaron was kind of a strange cat.
[02:28:53.298 --> 02:28:55.039]  So what does the book of Exodus tell us?
[02:28:55.759 --> 02:29:02.041]  When the Hebrews came out of the slavery in Egypt led by Moses, they carried silver and gold that they had received from the Egyptians.
[02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:03.942]  And when Moses went up Mount Sinai,
[02:29:04.682 --> 02:29:09.143]  To receive the Ten Commandments, he left the Israelites alone for 40 days and 40 nights.
[02:29:09.603 --> 02:29:18.166]  And although they were freed from slavery needed by the Almighty, and theoretically knew about his precepts through Moses, they disobeyed.
[02:29:18.746 --> 02:29:20.186]  Remember the story of the gold calf?
[02:29:21.187 --> 02:29:29.109]  Now, when the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, come, make us gods and we'll go before us.
[02:29:29.790 --> 02:29:34.994]  As for this Moses who brought us up, you know, from the land of Egypt, we don't know what happened to him.
[02:29:35.654 --> 02:29:38.096]  And so Aaron told him, take off your gold earrings, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:41.498]  And so that all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
[02:29:41.538 --> 02:29:46.421]  He took the gold from their hands and with an engraving tool, he fashioned into a molten calf.
[02:29:47.322 --> 02:29:47.642]  Okay.
[02:29:48.122 --> 02:29:55.207]  So after the conversation between the Lord and Moses, Moses went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand.
[02:29:55.948 --> 02:29:57.749]  They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
[02:29:57.949 --> 02:29:59.190]  And the tablets were the work of God.
[02:30:00.632 --> 02:30:00.972]  Okay?
[02:30:01.252 --> 02:30:02.413]  Now, but that's not all.
[02:30:02.433 --> 02:30:04.494]  They also created two Arks of the Covenant.
[02:30:05.055 --> 02:30:16.281]  We're talking about an artifact believed to be the most sacred relic of the Israelites, which is described as a wooden chest covered in pure gold with an elaborately designed lid called the Mercy Seat.
[02:30:16.981 --> 02:30:21.424]  According to the Book of Exodus, the Ark contained two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments.
[02:30:21.724 --> 02:30:23.865]  And these Arks of the Covenant are different.
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:29.923]  The ark which was in Jerusalem, where the supporters of Moses settled, is supported by the angels.
[02:30:30.303 --> 02:30:38.648]  And in the corners of the second ark, which was with the supporters of Aaron, who settled to the north in Israel, is supported by the bulls.
[02:30:39.188 --> 02:30:43.870]  And therefore, when they say that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, the Iranians say, are you crazy?
[02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:44.811]  This is impossible!
[02:30:45.794 --> 02:30:50.777]  Historically speaking and biblically, but again, Iran never said that Israel had no right to exist.
[02:30:51.077 --> 02:30:54.318]  They do not like the Jewish state, which has taken this name.
[02:30:54.839 --> 02:31:02.263]  By the way, when the question of how to name the state was discussed, one option was to call it Judea, but the party of Aaron won and it became Israel.
[02:31:03.063 --> 02:31:06.865]  Sure, so just like Jesus said, there's always a real thing and a counterfeit.
[02:31:08.413 --> 02:31:09.013]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:31:09.173 --> 02:31:18.919]  You know, so if you kind of look at the bigger picture, what's happening in the middle is because the mainstream media and a lot of the pundits would like to focus, narrowly focus, as if it was a wrestling match.
[02:31:19.279 --> 02:31:19.999]  The good and the bad.
[02:31:20.079 --> 02:31:20.780]  The dialectic.
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:27.163]  So, for Israel as a state, the assassination of Ismail Hanaya is meaningless and unprofitable.
[02:31:27.844 --> 02:31:31.866]  Because Hanaya was a political leader of Hamas recognized by Israel.
[02:31:32.606 --> 02:31:37.809]  And negotiations were held with him on the exchange of hostages, ceasefire with Hezbollah,
[02:31:38.479 --> 02:31:41.080]  So if Israel is not behind the assassination, then who is?
[02:31:42.141 --> 02:31:46.743]  The assassination benefits Netanyahu in order to keep his position as Prime Minister of the country.
[02:31:47.463 --> 02:31:48.224]  That's on the one hand.
[02:31:48.244 --> 02:31:51.185]  There's another thing, Alex.
[02:31:51.485 --> 02:31:53.666]  Iran is selling heavy water to the United States.
[02:31:53.686 --> 02:31:55.227]  A lot of people don't know this.
[02:31:55.687 --> 02:31:57.728]  United States media is not telling you about this.
[02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:59.849]  Possibly through certain countries.
[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:03.751]  Now, heavy water contains deuterium atoms and is used in what?
[02:32:04.031 --> 02:32:05.232]  In nuclear reactors.
[02:32:05.931 --> 02:32:15.814]  And so the United States has begun negotiations to buy enriched uranium from Iran as one of the conditions for returning to the nuclear agreement with Iran, from which Trump withdrew.
[02:32:16.414 --> 02:32:22.016]  And these negotiations on uranium, needless to say, were also interrupted by the assassinations of Heneye.
[02:32:22.576 --> 02:32:29.398]  Now, if you look at a much bigger picture, even than that, in the Middle East and beyond, as I said, we have a $4 quadrillion U.S.
[02:32:29.438 --> 02:32:29.638]  debt.
[02:32:30.624 --> 02:32:34.505]  I was about to try to tie that into the Iranian imminent strikes.
[02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:35.646]  What do you see coming from that?
[02:32:36.386 --> 02:32:40.387]  The Trump assassination updates, the stock market, Ukraine collapse.
[02:32:40.427 --> 02:32:41.708]  I mean, it all is crazy.
[02:32:42.548 --> 02:32:46.489]  You have to understand that, you know, there's the visible players, Alex, and the invisible player.
[02:32:46.509 --> 02:32:47.330]  You know how this works.
[02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:53.492]  I mean, you're the guy that, you know, covered and uncovered and brought to light, you know, all the evil deeds of the Bohemian Grove.
[02:32:54.272 --> 02:32:55.252]  You know how this works.
[02:32:55.813 --> 02:32:56.993]  So the visible players,
[02:32:57.819 --> 02:33:00.422]  Hamas, Iran, Israel.
[02:33:00.942 --> 02:33:04.046]  But if you kind of look at the invisible players, who is behind these players?
[02:33:04.506 --> 02:33:08.270]  It's very difficult to believe that Hamas is an independent player.
[02:33:08.570 --> 02:33:11.453]  So if Hamas is not an independent player, who is behind Hamas?
[02:33:12.014 --> 02:33:13.015]  Well, Israel founded it.
[02:33:13.175 --> 02:33:13.756]  Israel founded it.
[02:33:14.717 --> 02:33:15.238]  Exactly.
[02:33:15.298 --> 02:33:31.836]  So unleashing these maximum tensions in the Middle East requires launching Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, massacres of Israeli Jews, Jews massacring the Arabs, Israeli settlers' actions against the Palestinians, Palestinians against the Israeli settlers, to prepare the climate.
[02:33:32.376 --> 02:33:37.779]  And all sides are controlled from London, as all covertly work together on the ground.
[02:33:37.799 --> 02:33:41.762]  For example, if you're talking about Hamas, we're talking about the Islamic resistance movement.
[02:33:42.242 --> 02:33:53.489]  Hamas, which includes both the military and the political wing, was formed in Israeli occupied territories back in 1987 as a kind of an outgrowth of a Palestinian branch of Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:33:53.969 --> 02:34:09.412]  And it's an outgrowth of the networks of the British General John Bagot Glob, the decades-long head of the Jordan-based Arab Legion, who fielded insurgent Islamic political groups throughout the Middle East under the pretext of fighting Communist infiltration in the region.
[02:34:09.772 --> 02:34:19.694]  And so Glob Pasha is also the godfather of the Islamic Jihad, whereas the British co-thinkers operating out of the Shiite city of Naviev, Iraq, spawned the Hezbollah.
[02:34:20.234 --> 02:34:49.365]  And so from its inception, Alex, Hamas's military and terrorist actions against the Israeli military and civilian population primarily served one objective, to undermine Yasser Arafat and Palestine Liberation Organization's civil resistance campaign against the Israeli occupation, the Intifada, the resistance movement, which contributed to establishing the conditions leading sane Israelis to realize that peace with the Palestinians was a strategic necessity for Israel.
[02:34:49.865 --> 02:34:51.666]  And so Oslo Accord was the result.
[02:34:51.966 --> 02:34:55.608]  And so the Hamas's headquarters outside the Middle East, right now it's in Qatar.
[02:34:56.288 --> 02:34:57.008]  Where is it located?
[02:34:57.028 --> 02:35:05.972]  It's located in London, which also serves as headquarters of what most overtly are agent provocateur wing, the Izz Ad-Din Al-Qassam.
[02:35:06.696 --> 02:35:09.218]  And this is Adin al-Qassam Brigades.
[02:35:09.579 --> 02:35:12.842]  They conduct anti-Israeli attacks, including suicide bombings.
[02:35:13.202 --> 02:35:14.043]  But this isn't now.
[02:35:14.363 --> 02:35:16.165]  This is going back like 30 years ago.
[02:35:16.265 --> 02:35:18.447]  No, you've done a great historical analysis.
[02:35:18.467 --> 02:35:20.709]  We'll come back for a full hour later this week or next week if we can.
[02:35:20.729 --> 02:35:22.911]  But the time we have then, we know your history.
[02:35:22.951 --> 02:35:23.572]  People don't know it.
[02:35:23.592 --> 02:35:26.915]  It's important to know history, kind of like Putin gave a lecture to Tucker Carlson.
[02:35:26.935 --> 02:35:30.158]  But what do you think is going to happen now with these different factions?
[02:35:31.331 --> 02:35:38.374]  Well, it's a good question because, again, one of the things we need to analyze, Alex, is actually who is representing what interests.
[02:35:38.855 --> 02:35:43.937]  We know that London represents Hamas, and behind the Israelis you have the United States, okay?
[02:35:44.157 --> 02:35:47.018]  Now you have Kamala Harris, and now you have Donald Trump.
[02:35:47.038 --> 02:35:49.319]  What does Kamala Harris represent that Joe Biden didn't?
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:50.200]  Who is he with?
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:51.961]  What do these people want?
[02:35:52.101 --> 02:35:53.942]  And again, you have to put it in a greater context.
[02:35:54.302 --> 02:35:58.465]  How do you turn this little conflict into a bigger conflict, which is what the elite want?
[02:35:58.845 --> 02:36:07.291]  And the idea is there are some people, sane people, okay, in the United States government, both Republicans and Democrats, they don't want this war to expand because they don't know if they can control it.
[02:36:07.711 --> 02:36:15.096]  Because when it goes beyond a certain point of no return, okay, we will staring, you know, face into a thermonuclear conflict.
[02:36:15.791 --> 02:36:17.272]  But again, the elite have a problem.
[02:36:17.312 --> 02:36:18.812]  It's a $4 quadrillion debt.
[02:36:19.172 --> 02:36:20.453]  You need to eliminate that debt.
[02:36:20.473 --> 02:36:25.154]  You have a lot of interests behind the players, behind the Hamas, behind the Hezbollah.
[02:36:25.394 --> 02:36:26.515]  Iran doesn't want a war.
[02:36:27.155 --> 02:36:28.355]  Israel doesn't want a war.
[02:36:28.675 --> 02:36:31.817]  The Prime Minister Netanyahu, he absolutely wants the conflict.
[02:36:32.177 --> 02:36:37.639]  Because the idea is that if the war stops, okay, we'll go back to the way things were before October 7th, he's gonna go to prison.
[02:36:38.359 --> 02:36:41.440]  And there's a lot of people in the United States... And there'll be an investigation of October 7th.
[02:36:42.958 --> 02:36:44.679]  There'll be an investigation of October 7th.
[02:36:44.739 --> 02:36:48.381]  That's going to obviously, you know, touch certain interests in the United States.
[02:36:48.941 --> 02:36:52.202]  And all this stuff with, you know, like we're looking at three months before the elections.
[02:36:52.563 --> 02:36:55.204]  And Iran said they reserved the right to attack whenever they want.
[02:36:55.544 --> 02:36:57.785]  And Trump said it was going to be yesterday, I think, or today.
[02:36:58.345 --> 02:37:06.729]  I see the attack as end of August, beginning of September, when the presidential campaign really gets going, because the United States does not want any hostilities.
[02:37:07.090 --> 02:37:07.690]  And in fact,
[02:37:08.524 --> 02:37:20.513]  The latest I'm hearing, you know, from my sources, is that the United States government, through the extra official sources, they're saying, telling the Iranian leadership, if you don't attack, we're going to unfreeze all your money.
[02:37:21.114 --> 02:37:25.597]  OK, they can't afford a thermonuclear war because you cannot control it.
[02:37:25.978 --> 02:37:29.280]  There's just too many, you know, elements which you cannot control.
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:34.084]  And so it all goes down to Netanyahu who is in trouble and the whole world's on the brink because he wants to stay in power.
[02:37:34.935 --> 02:37:37.496]  I think Netanyahu needs to be eliminated one way or another.
[02:37:37.576 --> 02:37:44.318]  There's people in Israel, especially in the military, the Israeli military do not want Netanyahu as the leader.
[02:37:44.358 --> 02:37:46.838]  They want him out because they understand the consequences.
[02:37:47.198 --> 02:37:53.300]  Netanyahu's son, by the way, is in Miami, you know, partying, you know, showing off his money, his gold watches, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:55.160]  I mean, you know, I don't really understand.
[02:37:55.481 --> 02:37:59.442]  You have Netanyahu's son is in Miami showing off his, you know, $50,000 Rolex watch.
[02:38:00.842 --> 02:38:08.924]  You know, Fidel Castro's grandson of this enormous, you know, $10 million yacht showing off, you know, a $200,000 bottle of champagne.
[02:38:09.164 --> 02:38:10.364]  Why do these people do this?
[02:38:10.944 --> 02:38:13.805]  There's a good saying in Switzerland, money likes silence.
[02:38:14.045 --> 02:38:14.265]  Yeah.
[02:38:14.405 --> 02:38:17.566]  People who are really, really wealthy, they never show their wealth.
[02:38:17.966 --> 02:38:19.466]  It doesn't mean that they drive a Peugeot.
[02:38:19.686 --> 02:38:22.947]  You could drive a Mercedes Benz, but it doesn't mean you have to drive a $5 million car.
[02:38:23.847 --> 02:38:26.228]  And that's what these people who have never had money, that's what they do.
[02:38:26.488 --> 02:38:27.228]  Because they're thieves.
[02:38:27.589 --> 02:38:29.169]  We could say the same thing about Maduro.
[02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:31.690]  We could say the same thing about, you know, Netanyahu-san.
[02:38:32.010 --> 02:38:33.771]  You know, some of the oligarchs from Russia.
[02:38:33.811 --> 02:38:34.451]  It doesn't matter.
[02:38:34.711 --> 02:38:36.232]  It's a global phenomenon.
[02:38:36.452 --> 02:38:38.893]  But the situation is that the army does not like Netanyahu.
[02:38:39.553 --> 02:38:40.294]  They want him out.
[02:38:41.454 --> 02:38:43.035]  Is there going to be a coup d'etat in Israel?
[02:38:43.435 --> 02:38:44.035]  I don't know.
[02:38:44.055 --> 02:38:45.076]  I don't discard that.
[02:38:45.796 --> 02:38:46.056]  Okay?
[02:38:46.076 --> 02:38:51.158]  If things, you know, if push comes to shove, the army may take the necessary step to get rid of him.
[02:38:51.498 --> 02:38:53.139]  Because he's a danger to world peace.
[02:38:54.588 --> 02:38:55.749]  Well, absolutely.
[02:38:56.129 --> 02:39:00.631]  And so, what about another attempt on Trump?
[02:39:00.691 --> 02:39:02.211]  I mean, they failed once.
[02:39:04.872 --> 02:39:06.953]  Absolutely, I see it coming.
[02:39:07.013 --> 02:39:13.276]  The problem with Donald Trump for the global elite, he represents an alternative global project.
[02:39:13.876 --> 02:39:14.236]  Okay?
[02:39:14.617 --> 02:39:20.059]  If you say, like, the objective, Alex, after the, you know, post-crisis,
[02:39:20.971 --> 02:39:24.833]  Is for the winners to sit down at the table in a kind of a Yalta 2.0.
[02:39:24.873 --> 02:39:29.335]  Yeah, the Yalta 1.0 after World War II were the winning sides.
[02:39:30.696 --> 02:39:35.258]  Soviet Union, England, and who else was there?
[02:39:35.358 --> 02:39:35.818]  And Russia.
[02:39:36.038 --> 02:39:37.459]  No, Soviet Union, England, who else?
[02:39:37.719 --> 02:39:38.479]  And the United States.
[02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:40.120]  They sat down in Yalta.
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.561]  Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin.
[02:39:41.761 --> 02:39:45.322]  And they discussed what the post-World War II world was going to look like.
[02:39:45.683 --> 02:39:47.143]  You're going to need to do the same thing right now.
[02:39:47.163 --> 02:39:48.344]  So who's going to sit at this table?
[02:39:48.959 --> 02:39:56.362]  You're going to have Putin representing Russia, you're going to have Xi Jinping representing China, you're going to have Modi representing India, and you're going to have someone representing the United States.
[02:39:56.522 --> 02:39:57.502]  Who is that going to be?
[02:39:58.262 --> 02:39:58.483]  Okay?
[02:39:58.523 --> 02:40:09.847]  Because neither Trump, or it doesn't matter if it's Biden or Kamala Harris or whoever, they don't represent the United States in the sense that they represent a small sliver of the United States because the United States as a nation-state is terribly divided.
[02:40:09.867 --> 02:40:11.567]  So how do you unite a country?
[02:40:11.927 --> 02:40:12.388]  You can't.
[02:40:13.148 --> 02:40:15.949]  And so whoever wins this conflict right now, Battle Royal,
[02:40:16.698 --> 02:40:19.662]  Okay, and Kamala Harris cannot win on the, you know, the polls numbers.
[02:40:20.023 --> 02:40:21.946]  Allegedly, she's... It's all nonsense.
[02:40:21.966 --> 02:40:22.426]  You know that.
[02:40:22.967 --> 02:40:23.948]  I mean, she's a cackler.
[02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:25.070]  She can't talk.
[02:40:25.571 --> 02:40:26.312]  You heard her talking.
[02:40:26.332 --> 02:40:28.275]  She's, you know, just shit for brains.
[02:40:28.914 --> 02:40:31.096]  You can't have that person as the President of the United States.
[02:40:31.396 --> 02:40:32.798]  I don't care what the deep state wants.
[02:40:32.838 --> 02:40:33.678]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:40:33.698 --> 02:40:34.539]  So they're in a rockin' hard place.
[02:40:34.559 --> 02:40:35.180]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:36.001 --> 02:40:37.202]  You always know everything I bring up.
[02:40:37.342 --> 02:40:38.523]  Did you see Jamie Raskin?
[02:40:38.563 --> 02:40:40.104]  I know he's one of the top leftist planners.
[02:40:40.445 --> 02:40:43.207]  That famous communist saying, we're going to have a civil war.
[02:40:43.567 --> 02:40:45.089]  We're going to overthrow the Supreme Court.
[02:40:45.689 --> 02:40:47.971]  And we're going to remove Trump, whether he likes it or not.
[02:40:48.352 --> 02:40:50.474]  And we're going to all have paramilitary forces.
[02:40:50.914 --> 02:40:56.660]  Now, this guy couldn't find his ass in both hands, but he is one of the top deciders in the leftist Obama cabal.
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:58.482]  What do you make about a statement?
[02:40:58.502 --> 02:41:00.324]  Is that meant to make his people feel powerful?
[02:41:00.344 --> 02:41:01.605]  To have confidence?
[02:41:02.486 --> 02:41:04.368]  It's a very good observation, Alex.
[02:41:04.488 --> 02:41:05.770]  Again, he's not a player.
[02:41:06.370 --> 02:41:08.012]  You can talk about Klaus Schwab.
[02:41:08.372 --> 02:41:09.854]  Klaus Schwab says all kinds of things.
[02:41:10.314 --> 02:41:11.355]  And people listen to him.
[02:41:11.515 --> 02:41:13.457]  Presidents, prime ministers, you know.
[02:41:13.717 --> 02:41:14.778]  But why do they listen to him?
[02:41:14.818 --> 02:41:15.658]  Because he's important?
[02:41:15.678 --> 02:41:16.519]  No, he's not important.
[02:41:16.539 --> 02:41:17.099]  He's a clown.
[02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:21.863]  They listen to him because he is the voice of the real power behind the throne.
[02:41:22.283 --> 02:41:23.164]  That's why they listen.
[02:41:23.204 --> 02:41:24.425]  That's why they pay attention to him.
[02:41:24.465 --> 02:41:25.366]  That's why they receive him.
[02:41:25.606 --> 02:41:27.387]  That's why they read attentively what he writes.
[02:41:27.648 --> 02:41:29.249]  Doesn't even matter if he writes or if he doesn't.
[02:41:29.589 --> 02:41:31.110]  He is the voice of the elite.
[02:41:31.671 --> 02:41:32.031]  Exactly.
[02:41:32.071 --> 02:41:33.212]  So he's the mouthpiece.
[02:41:33.232 --> 02:41:34.433]  So what does his statement mean?
[02:41:35.387 --> 02:41:38.288]  It means that there's going to be a civil war in America.
[02:41:38.348 --> 02:41:40.709]  Something we've been talking about for over ten years.
[02:41:41.329 --> 02:41:41.649]  Okay?
[02:41:41.889 --> 02:41:44.490]  Yeah, you said it two weeks ago and now he's saying it.
[02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:45.931]  I said it ten years ago, Alec.
[02:41:45.991 --> 02:41:46.951]  I said it ten years ago.
[02:41:46.971 --> 02:41:47.892]  I know you did on the show.
[02:41:47.972 --> 02:41:48.692]  I agree.
[02:41:48.712 --> 02:41:52.053]  You said it when I made Endgame with you.
[02:41:52.133 --> 02:41:53.194]  Seventeen years ago you did.
[02:41:53.334 --> 02:41:53.714]  We know that.
[02:41:53.734 --> 02:41:55.054]  I'm saying two weeks ago you said that.
[02:41:55.334 --> 02:41:55.975]  Now he's saying it.
[02:41:55.995 --> 02:41:56.435]  What does that mean?
[02:41:57.352 --> 02:41:59.173]  Well, it means that you're going to have a civil war.
[02:41:59.573 --> 02:42:05.217]  And the problem is that the United States as a country, we talked about this as well, like you and I have a life cycle.
[02:42:05.577 --> 02:42:10.200]  Maybe we'll live 80 years, maybe 90, maybe 100, but every country in the world has its own cycle.
[02:42:10.681 --> 02:42:14.883]  And the United States as a country lives on an 80 year cycle, give or take two or three years.
[02:42:15.123 --> 02:42:26.130]  And if you kind of look at it, so for the people understand the kind of a linear progression, if you go back, not to the, you know, to the Mayflower, a little bit after that, if you go to the end of the 1600s and you start adding 80 years,
[02:42:27.211 --> 02:42:31.015]  The first 80-year period takes you to 1776, that's the Revolution.
[02:42:31.495 --> 02:42:35.199]  The second 80-year period takes you to 1860, that's the Civil War.
[02:42:35.439 --> 02:42:38.782]  The next 80-year period takes you to 1940, that's the Second World War.
[02:42:39.062 --> 02:42:40.924]  The last 80-year period takes you to 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[02:42:41.345 --> 02:42:46.429]  We're talking about COVID, we're talking about Great Reset, everything else.
[02:42:46.449 --> 02:42:47.991]  So the United States historically
[02:42:48.591 --> 02:42:49.752]  I would choose civil war.
[02:42:49.812 --> 02:42:52.574]  I would choose civil war over nuclear war, obviously.
[02:43:17.822 --> 02:43:20.664]  Well, you know, again, unfortunately, you and I are sane individuals.
[02:43:20.684 --> 02:43:24.527]  We prefer none of the none of the conflict and solve things differently.
[02:43:24.748 --> 02:43:30.412]  But the thing is that it's absolutely and there's a reason why you have, you know, Hollywood mouthpiece showing you the film Civil War.
[02:43:30.432 --> 02:43:36.077]  I mean, it's absolutely certain the country is so divided on itself that there's no other way to solve these differences.
[02:43:36.637 --> 02:43:58.633]  And had Trump, you know, you and I talked about this before, had Trump, when the elections were stolen from him in 2020, had Trump said, you know, with the American flag in hand, you know, to the barricades, let's go for these people, you know, the United States, by the end of 2021, would have been coming out, you know, the tail end of that civil war, still the number one nation in the world, economically, financially, politically, technologically, etc.
[02:43:58.733 --> 02:43:59.814]  But Trump chickened out.
[02:44:00.535 --> 02:44:05.076]  And as a consequence, right now the United States is far worse off than it was four years ago.
[02:44:05.376 --> 02:44:07.457]  The situation is more complex than ever.
[02:44:07.777 --> 02:44:09.898]  Russia is stronger than ever.
[02:44:10.218 --> 02:44:12.399]  China and Russia are now, you know, biggest buddies.
[02:44:12.759 --> 02:44:15.119]  And so the United States is in a very difficult situation.
[02:44:15.179 --> 02:44:15.600]  No, you're right.
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:16.380]  Stay there, Daniel.
[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:17.600]  Daniel Esselstyn, stay there.
[02:44:17.620 --> 02:44:19.741]  People will find you at Esselstyn.media.
[02:44:19.781 --> 02:44:22.422]  Do five more minutes with us, and Roger Stone's got big breaking news.
[02:44:22.442 --> 02:44:24.302]  I could talk to Daniel Esselstyn all day.
[02:44:24.382 --> 02:44:29.284]  Yeah, we don't want civil war or nuclear war, but I would take civil war over nuclear war every day.
[02:44:29.604 --> 02:44:30.204]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:30.524 --> 02:44:34.770]  A lot of people have been asking me how they support him for this critical fight.
[02:44:35.410 --> 02:44:35.991]  And it's simple.

[02:44:49.618 --> 02:44:51.538]  Some wars were just, some wars were bad.
[02:44:51.979 --> 02:44:55.880]  But still, we've supported the troops and their memento of the campaign they've been through.
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:04.802]  Well, we're working with one of the top companies in America that is supporting so many great conservative talk shows, like the Hodge Twins and so many others.

[02:46:30.505 --> 02:46:33.646]  Well, I hope listeners here listening to us at 2 p.m.
[02:46:33.686 --> 02:46:34.586]  Central Standard Time
[02:46:36.109 --> 02:46:38.190]  Understand, this is not a Netflix show.
[02:46:38.770 --> 02:46:39.911]  This is not a movie.
[02:46:40.171 --> 02:46:41.452]  It's not a James Bond flick.
[02:46:41.872 --> 02:46:43.613]  This is the real world, and you live on it.
[02:46:44.493 --> 02:46:49.516]  And Daniel Esselstyn's the best-selling author, great researcher, expert on this, and he's dead on.
[02:46:50.876 --> 02:46:55.659]  Raskin, who is a minion of the globalists, but a high-level functionary, says we're having a civil war.
[02:46:56.619 --> 02:46:58.780]  And they're gonna make it racial, just like they're trying in England right now.
[02:47:00.061 --> 02:47:01.382]  So in the time we have left,
[02:47:02.458 --> 02:47:03.879]  What is the crash landing?
[02:47:03.939 --> 02:47:07.641]  What is the best case scenario of a lot of bad scenarios here?
[02:47:07.721 --> 02:47:11.763]  And what are you hoping happens versus what you think is going to happen, Daniel?
[02:47:12.763 --> 02:47:14.724]  Well, first of all, you know, Trump has to win.
[02:47:15.844 --> 02:47:19.366]  OK, there's no if Trump loses, then America is going to have a really, really hard time.
[02:47:20.187 --> 02:47:25.049]  OK, America is right now the United States right now is like comparison wise.
[02:47:25.409 --> 02:47:29.211]  It's like the Soviet Union back in 1982 when Brezhnev was on his deathbed.
[02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:35.283]  Every time Brezhnev would come out, you know, they'd pump him with pills.
[02:47:35.603 --> 02:47:37.104]  Nobody would have a clue what he was saying.
[02:47:37.684 --> 02:47:38.624]  Well, Biden is the same.
[02:47:39.445 --> 02:47:41.526]  And then it brought Chernenko and Andropov.
[02:47:41.606 --> 02:47:43.867]  All these people died over the next couple of years.
[02:47:44.127 --> 02:47:46.188]  And then Gorbachev appeared and the rest is obvious.
[02:47:46.208 --> 02:47:47.229]  The Soviet Union collapsed.
[02:47:48.109 --> 02:47:50.571]  So the United States right now is a very difficult predicament.
[02:47:51.211 --> 02:47:58.094]  OK, Trump, you know, he's, again, let's go back to the debate with Biden, whatever you want to call it, debate, quote unquote.
[02:48:00.003 --> 02:48:01.624]  Did Trump say anything relevant?
[02:48:01.684 --> 02:48:02.504]  No, he really didn't.
[02:48:03.084 --> 02:48:05.565]  Is that because Biden was totally out of it?
[02:48:06.485 --> 02:48:06.966]  Probably.
[02:48:07.806 --> 02:48:10.907]  But he really didn't propose anything new.
[02:48:12.148 --> 02:48:14.889]  There was no new ideas as to what he would do to the country.
[02:48:15.689 --> 02:48:18.490]  So I think the United States is an ideological problem right now.
[02:48:18.530 --> 02:48:19.550]  What are you as a country?
[02:48:20.651 --> 02:48:22.431]  Are you still a constitutional republic?
[02:48:22.451 --> 02:48:23.372]  Are you a democracy?
[02:48:23.952 --> 02:48:25.873]  What's your objective short term?
[02:48:26.493 --> 02:48:29.314]  I think the objective short term has to be you have to organize your own house.
[02:48:30.299 --> 02:48:33.620]  And so the United States has got to organize the United States from within.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:37.641]  It means it doesn't have the money or the forces to do it, you know, without.
[02:48:38.561 --> 02:48:42.522]  Which means that Venezuela, you know, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia.
[02:48:43.342 --> 02:48:45.823]  As Trump said, you know, Xi Jinping is a killer.
[02:48:46.343 --> 02:48:49.183]  Not because he kills people, but he's just, you know, a killer negotiator.
[02:48:49.904 --> 02:48:51.204]  The same could be said for Trump, you know.
[02:48:51.244 --> 02:48:52.884]  He said he's a fierce man.
[02:48:53.864 --> 02:48:54.625]  He's a fierce man.
[02:48:54.685 --> 02:48:56.125]  Well, you know, whatever you want to call it.
[02:48:56.750 --> 02:49:03.316]  And so the United States is in a very difficult predicament because the people they have running the country, they have really no idea what to do.
[02:49:04.296 --> 02:49:07.719]  And so what you're seeing right now behind the scenes, again, we're talking about the global elite.
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.381]  In England, what are we seeing?
[02:49:09.421 --> 02:49:11.302]  We're seeing the white population being wiped out.
[02:49:12.163 --> 02:49:13.704]  It's not a racist statement.
[02:49:14.225 --> 02:49:15.846]  What they're doing is also very obvious.
[02:49:15.886 --> 02:49:20.110]  These are the people, the natives, not the native Indians, but the natives,
[02:49:20.931 --> 02:49:26.593]  The white people of England, these people understand freedom, freedom of speech, democracy, they understand their rights.
[02:49:27.353 --> 02:49:33.536]  And so these people are being eliminated, they're being substituted by multiculturalism, which is a euphonism for control.
[02:49:33.556 --> 02:49:37.157]  And they want to do the same thing in Europe, and that's being done by the Vatican.
[02:49:38.658 --> 02:49:44.280]  Who is running all these people from North Africa and Central Africa?
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:46.801]  It's the Vatican.
[02:49:46.821 --> 02:49:48.622]  They've been doing this for 2,000 years.
[02:49:48.682 --> 02:49:49.643]  They got the ways and the means.
[02:49:50.143 --> 02:49:51.283]  And why are they doing this?
[02:49:51.804 --> 02:49:54.325]  Because Vatican is a very right-wing organization.
[02:49:54.805 --> 02:49:56.006]  They've been around for a long time.
[02:49:56.666 --> 02:50:01.149]  Europe today is pusillanimous, it's LGBT, it's all kinds of degeneracies.
[02:50:01.749 --> 02:50:11.975]  So by bringing these people from Africa who are young, fiercely religious, angry, very right-wing, hungry, they don't have children, they don't have wives.
[02:50:12.913 --> 02:50:16.654]  And so they're flabbergasted and appalled by what they see in Europe.
[02:50:17.215 --> 02:50:20.816]  You know, men wearing skirts and, you know, high-heeled shoes.
[02:50:22.056 --> 02:50:23.116]  And so they're destroying them.
[02:50:23.717 --> 02:50:24.477]  They're wiping them out.
[02:50:24.517 --> 02:50:29.479]  They're doing it in Spain, in Italy, in Germany, in Sweden.
[02:50:29.519 --> 02:50:32.240]  They're doing it, you know, the entire European... We're seeing it right now in England.
[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:39.242]  And so the idea is to destroy that LGBT culture, that pusillanimous, you know, liberalism.
[02:50:39.862 --> 02:50:42.203]  And then the next step after that, the mask comes off.
[02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:43.851]  And you have the fourth right.
[02:50:43.991 --> 02:50:47.513]  Hardcore, but hardcore right-wing dictatorship Alex.
[02:50:47.554 --> 02:50:54.739]  It's a mixture of Hitler and Stalin and Mao Zedong and Chinggis Khan all in one.
[02:50:55.139 --> 02:50:55.960]  I think you're dead on.
[02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:57.541]  Daniel, we got to go.
[02:50:57.561 --> 02:51:00.903]  You're going to host with me for an hour next week and co-host the fourth hour.
[02:51:00.923 --> 02:51:01.504]  You already agreed?
[02:51:01.884 --> 02:51:03.765]  You picked the day with the crew right now.
[02:51:03.785 --> 02:51:08.269]  I want to go, I want to start over right where you began, right where you ended just now, okay?
[02:51:09.775 --> 02:51:10.195]  Take care, Alex.
[02:51:10.255 --> 02:51:11.936]  All right, we'll have a lot to talk about next week.
[02:51:11.976 --> 02:51:14.417]  Daniel Esselstyn, find him at Esselstyn.media.
[02:51:14.437 --> 02:51:15.478]  Thank you, Daniel Esselstyn.
[02:51:15.878 --> 02:51:16.639]  Esselstyn.media.
[02:51:17.059 --> 02:51:20.080]  All right, the mighty Roger Stone with big breaking news.
[02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:20.741]  60 seconds out.
[02:51:21.141 --> 02:51:23.902]  Follow me on X at Real Alex Jones, because I'm real.
[02:51:24.483 --> 02:51:33.627]  Well, he did it weeks ago, but he did it on July 31st, just seven days ago, when nobody was saying it was going to be Tim Walz, the horrible governor of Minnesota.
[02:51:35.568 --> 02:51:36.929]  Roger Stone predicted it.
[02:51:37.009 --> 02:51:38.210]  Here's one of his predictions.
[02:51:39.538 --> 02:51:51.123]  Well, I predicted here earlier that they're going to take this obscure Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, for vice president because he's the least controversial of the potential running mates.
[02:51:52.244 --> 02:52:06.831]  The Democratic Party has a gigantic issue, given its divisions over the issues and the events in the Middle East and the attacks sponsored by Iran, paid for by Iran.
[02:52:07.991 --> 02:52:10.133]  On Israel that began October 7th.
[02:52:10.693 --> 02:52:12.755]  They want to try to have it both ways.
[02:52:12.795 --> 02:52:14.316]  They cannot have it both ways.
[02:52:15.017 --> 02:52:16.978]  Their party's badly divided.
[02:52:17.298 --> 02:52:18.399]  They have a lot of problems.
[02:52:18.559 --> 02:52:20.501]  Are they capable of another pandemic?
[02:52:20.601 --> 02:52:20.901]  Yes.
[02:52:21.602 --> 02:52:24.304]  Are they capable of another attempt on Trump's life?
[02:52:24.624 --> 02:52:24.864]  Yes.
[02:52:25.324 --> 02:52:35.252]  My conclusion after studying as much as I can about what happened in Butler and also the knowledge of having written a book on this subject, I think they are capable of anything.
[02:52:36.565 --> 02:52:42.168]  And they didn't go with the Shapiro guy in Pennsylvania because he's IDF.
[02:52:42.808 --> 02:52:45.229]  So Roger, you called it three weeks ago.
[02:52:45.289 --> 02:52:47.390]  We couldn't find that clip, so you called it seven days ago.
[02:52:47.931 --> 02:52:49.431]  You called it when nobody else was.
[02:52:49.892 --> 02:52:50.752]  How did you do that?
[02:52:50.832 --> 02:52:52.453]  And then give us the inside baseball on this guy.
[02:52:53.646 --> 02:53:05.191]  Well, initially, Alex, I actually predicted that they would choose Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro simply because it would have changed the electoral map.
[02:53:05.231 --> 02:53:06.391]  He's extremely popular.
[02:53:06.772 --> 02:53:10.953]  Pennsylvania is the absolute battleground state.
[02:53:12.034 --> 02:53:14.655]  But then I began to hear that Barack Obama
[02:53:15.402 --> 02:53:34.390]  Who had finally decided to endorse Kamala, evidently having been unable to convince Michelle, who I think everyone understands would have been a stronger candidate, finally endorsed her, but then moved to assert his control and influence in her campaign.
[02:53:34.830 --> 02:53:57.081]  I think it was Obama who persuaded her that taking Shapiro, a Jew, who I believe had actually volunteered to fight for Israel and put him on the ticket, would cost the ticket both Michigan and Minnesota with their heavy Muslim American populations, which are very dominant and influential in the Democrat Party.
[02:53:57.361 --> 02:53:59.942]  And are very good at election fraud is coming out.
[02:54:01.538 --> 02:54:12.002]  Beyond that, Alex, I'd also say you had at the same time essentially the implosion of Arizona's Mark Kelly.
[02:54:12.382 --> 02:54:14.543]  Now, Kelly's a former astronaut.
[02:54:15.483 --> 02:54:30.388]  It turns out that he's in a partnership with a Chinese communist country to manufacture the kind of surveillance balloons that the Biden administration let float all the way across America
[02:54:31.209 --> 02:54:39.918]  Sure, so you called him weeks ago, he was out.
[02:54:39.958 --> 02:54:46.825]  So let's talk about walls, who this guy is, defunding police, supporting riots, supporting cutting little boys' ding-dings off.
[02:54:48.268 --> 02:54:52.110]  Walsh is an extreme progressive, but he is no wallflower.
[02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:55.911]  He did serve his country in the military.
[02:54:56.211 --> 02:54:57.412]  He's pretty militant.
[02:54:57.892 --> 02:55:14.339]  Some years ago, I just read a great piece about his having to be thrown out of a George W. Bush rally when he claimed to be a schoolteacher taking in a group of students when in fact he had been seen across the street.
[02:55:14.739 --> 02:55:15.820]  But they were mostly peaceful.
[02:55:36.887 --> 02:55:37.367]  I think so.
[02:55:52.565 --> 02:55:54.545]  The key to this is what Richard Nixon told me.
[02:55:55.046 --> 02:56:00.007]  When looking for a vice president, don't look for someone who can help you.
[02:56:00.607 --> 02:56:03.447]  Just look for someone who doesn't hurt you.
[02:56:03.967 --> 02:56:10.749]  So when I heard the last three finalists were Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, Kelly, the U.S.
[02:56:10.789 --> 02:56:16.450]  senator from Arizona, and Walz, the other two would hurt you.
[02:56:17.156 --> 02:56:20.197]  Pennsylvania running against Shapiro.
[02:56:20.837 --> 02:56:21.957]  There's a lot there.
[02:56:21.997 --> 02:56:32.240]  There's not only his handling of a very controversial murder where it appears that he had relationships with some of the people involved in the case.
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:35.461]  Jack Posobiec has reported brilliantly on this.
[02:56:35.901 --> 02:56:45.764]  Then there's the question of the conduct of the Pennsylvania State Police outside the perimeter of the Butler, Pennsylvania rally where Donald Trump
[02:56:47.805 --> 02:57:04.490]  And finally, being a member of the Israeli military, which is fine, except that shows dual allegiance.
[02:57:04.510 --> 02:57:06.271]  We're not going to hire somebody who's part of the British military.
[02:57:06.671 --> 02:57:11.972]  So, the bigger issue here, then, is what does this signify?
[02:57:12.052 --> 02:57:12.793]  What does this mean?
[02:57:12.853 --> 02:57:13.773]  It's him on the ticket now.
[02:57:15.178 --> 02:57:16.939]  You know, here's what I think it means.
[02:57:16.999 --> 02:57:19.761]  It means that Obama is consolidating his control.
[02:57:20.182 --> 02:57:38.934]  Now, just this past week, three top Obama operatives, David, I think you say Plouffe, he's got a strange spelling to his name, Stephanie Cutter, and Michael Stewart, who are, you know, who are operatives for Obama, have joined the campaign.
[02:57:38.974 --> 02:57:43.517]  They essentially get layered in- Well, they admit Holder was put in three weeks ago to pick the VP.
[02:57:45.191 --> 02:57:50.616]  Well, yes, Holder has an increasingly supervisory role here.
[02:57:50.856 --> 02:57:58.223]  They know that Kamala Harris is a flawed candidate, and they intend to try to tough this out.
[02:57:58.263 --> 02:58:00.585]  There are two things now going on.
[02:58:00.986 --> 02:58:02.948]  Obama is moving to assert control.
[02:58:03.208 --> 02:58:09.774]  There's going to be friction, though, because traditionally in her campaigns, including her 2020 presidential race,
[02:58:10.134 --> 02:58:12.195]  She layered people over with people.
[02:58:12.235 --> 02:58:16.736]  In other words, two people think they have the same authority and the same responsibility.
[02:58:16.856 --> 02:58:19.156]  Leads to infighting and problems.
[02:58:19.736 --> 02:58:21.457]  This is exactly you've got here.
[02:58:21.717 --> 02:58:28.098]  This is going to be as one friend of mine who actually supported her 2020 campaign.
[02:58:28.118 --> 02:58:30.139]  The campaign was a chaos.
[02:58:30.539 --> 02:58:39.481]  Secondarily, they know that she's given no press conferences and no one-on-one interviews since she was declared the nominee.
[02:58:40.061 --> 02:58:42.662]  When she does airport landings, she reads from a book.
[02:58:42.742 --> 02:58:45.824]  They don't even bother setting... Yeah, yeah, let's be clear.
[02:58:45.904 --> 02:58:51.467]  She's taken two questions since she was the presumptive nominee installed and she can't even talk.
[02:58:53.008 --> 02:58:53.708]  And they know that.
[02:58:53.848 --> 02:58:56.769]  Therefore, they have to figure out... So what is the word on her?
[02:58:56.789 --> 02:58:58.310]  Because I went back decades ago.
[02:58:58.330 --> 02:58:59.251]  We have old videos of her.
[02:58:59.671 --> 02:59:01.212]  She couldn't talk 20 years ago.
[02:59:01.232 --> 02:59:05.594]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but she literally comes off as like mentally retarded or autistic.
[02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:09.193]  She comes across extremely vapid in that laugh.
[02:59:09.474 --> 02:59:10.655]  It just goes on forever.
[02:59:10.675 --> 02:59:12.237]  It becomes irritating.
[02:59:12.257 --> 02:59:15.762]  Look, Willie Brown is actually a friend of mine.
[02:59:16.162 --> 02:59:21.950]  I met him when I was in San Francisco working for Trump casinos and hotel resorts.
[02:59:22.490 --> 02:59:24.151]  He's an old-fashioned Democrat.
[02:59:51.997 --> 02:59:53.879]  He's extremely well dressed.
[02:59:54.199 --> 03:00:00.566]  He was a powerhouse as the Speaker of the California Assembly before he was the mayor of San Francisco.
[03:00:00.907 --> 03:00:03.469]  He's a master politician and he's a gentleman.
[03:00:04.210 --> 03:00:07.974]  As far as his relationship with Kamala Harris, I'll let him speak for himself.
[03:00:08.014 --> 03:00:12.079]  And he's said quite a bit on the record, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:18.962]  It is interesting that Willie says that she's actually not as stupid as you think she is.
[03:00:19.182 --> 03:00:20.083]  It's not his words.
[03:00:20.123 --> 03:00:21.763]  He says, don't underestimate her.
[03:00:21.783 --> 03:00:25.045]  She's smarter than you think, but she's tactically smart.
[03:00:25.405 --> 03:00:30.027]  I haven't seen any evidence of that in her 2020 presidential campaign.
[03:00:30.367 --> 03:00:37.130]  I didn't see any evidence in her using the office of the vice president to improve her political situation.
[03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:40.631]  Look, for eight years under Eisenhower,
[03:00:41.031 --> 03:00:43.532]  Sure, I mean all of the history, the most voted for Republican in history.
[03:00:43.552 --> 03:00:44.032]  So, big picture.
[03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:08.580]  What does this mean, this new guy's in?
[03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:09.260]  What are his strengths?
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:10.021]  What are his weaknesses?
[03:01:10.501 --> 03:01:11.861]  Trump, what are the real numbers?
[03:01:12.521 --> 03:01:13.861]  They're obviously trying to kill Trump again.
[03:01:13.901 --> 03:01:15.582]  We have this Jamie Raskin clip.
[03:01:15.922 --> 03:01:25.184]  We know he's a high-level planner with the Globalist saying, we're going to have martial law, civil war, we're going to 14th Amendment Trump, we're going to have civil unrest when he gets elected, which they've already been admitting.
[03:01:25.544 --> 03:01:26.444]  Now he admits it.
[03:01:26.464 --> 03:01:27.584]  This is really concerning.
[03:01:27.624 --> 03:01:30.465]  We've got to somehow get Trump or somebody to talk about this.
[03:01:31.804 --> 03:01:34.289]  First of all, I don't think Wallace is going to matter all that much.
[03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:35.591]  He does no harm.
[03:01:35.611 --> 03:01:37.314]  He doesn't also bring them much.
[03:01:37.334 --> 03:01:38.876]  I also think J.D.
[03:01:39.177 --> 03:01:42.943]  Vance will be able to handle him in a bit because he's a hothead.
[03:01:43.430 --> 03:01:47.192]  He's very definitely a hothead, a guy who can't control his emotions.
[03:01:47.653 --> 03:01:49.374]  So I don't think he will matter.
[03:01:49.394 --> 03:01:52.336]  He's obsessed with castrating children, so he's bad.
[03:01:52.436 --> 03:01:52.776]  No, no.
[03:01:53.156 --> 03:02:03.563]  On a policy basis, his record, look, he wanted to redesign the state flag of Minnesota so it more carefully resembled the Somalian flag.
[03:02:04.023 --> 03:02:07.066]  Because he has a huge Somalian population.
[03:02:07.086 --> 03:02:08.287]  So he's a total weirdo.
[03:02:08.327 --> 03:02:11.169]  So shifting gears out of him, they tried to kill Trump.
[03:02:11.189 --> 03:02:12.170]  They're going to try to do it again.
[03:02:12.290 --> 03:02:12.830]  You predicted it.
[03:02:12.850 --> 03:02:13.350]  I predicted it.
[03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:13.811]  We're here.
[03:02:14.671 --> 03:02:25.160]  What do we do with, you know, 90 days, the election and all this insanity and the economy going into the crapper and just all how would you quantify where we are right now, Roger?
[03:02:27.522 --> 03:02:28.282]  Not without water.
[03:02:29.263 --> 03:02:31.885]  Look, I think right now we're in the middle of a PSYOP.
[03:02:32.583 --> 03:02:57.533]  Where they're using all of their media assets, including paid influencers, but the usual suspects, MSNBC, CNN, the three networks and so on, to try to create this illusion that she is wildly popular, that her campaign is surging, that she's gaining dramatically in the polls, that she's, you know, an ideal candidate.
[03:02:57.613 --> 03:02:59.314]  She's a historic candidate.
[03:03:00.496 --> 03:03:12.007]  And at the same time, they're running this massive PSYOP, stuffing tens of millions of dollars into her campaign through ActBlue, which is very questionable.
[03:03:12.107 --> 03:03:14.710]  We believe that there's more than sufficient evidence.
[03:03:15.010 --> 03:03:19.495]  James O'Keefe has done great work in this area, that millions of these dollars are not
[03:03:19.895 --> 03:03:22.942]  Yeah, attorney generals of open criminal investigations, absolutely.
[03:03:23.062 --> 03:03:24.305]  I'm just asking big picture.
[03:03:24.726 --> 03:03:30.237]  If they already tried to kill Trump, and they're in full panic mode, what are your concerns about black swan events?
[03:03:31.321 --> 03:03:45.572]  Here's my biggest concern, and that is people who killed John F. Kennedy, people who tried to kill Ronald Reagan, people who tried to kill Donald Trump, would not hesitate to kill Joe Biden if it served their purposes.
[03:03:46.292 --> 03:03:47.653]  Joe Biden is old.
[03:03:47.873 --> 03:03:49.434]  They had to force him out of the way.
[03:03:49.755 --> 03:03:50.695]  He's unhappy.
[03:03:51.076 --> 03:03:54.018]  He's probably a pain in the ass giving them campaign advice.
[03:03:54.678 --> 03:04:02.424]  On those rare occasions that he's lucid, but that would have the effect of elevating Kamala Harris to be the first woman president.
[03:04:02.444 --> 03:04:03.365]  So elaborate on that.
[03:04:03.405 --> 03:04:04.186]  I totally agree.
[03:04:04.686 --> 03:04:10.931]  Kill Biden to blame Trump supporters and then elevate Kamala Harris or he just dies of a stroke.
[03:04:10.951 --> 03:04:11.591]  They poison him.
[03:04:11.971 --> 03:04:13.272]  Still a big state funeral.
[03:04:13.473 --> 03:04:15.754]  I really think killing Biden's on the table.
[03:04:15.854 --> 03:04:16.415]  Elaborate.
[03:04:17.516 --> 03:04:21.399]  First of all, I want to be very clear that I'm neither wishing this on him nor am I proposing it.
[03:04:22.668 --> 03:04:27.309]  I'm just trying to observe based on history whether it is a possibility.
[03:04:27.730 --> 03:04:39.393]  If you go back to the church committee hearings, there's a discussion of their development of drugs that can, when injected in someone, will give the appearance they died of a heart attack without leaving a trace.
[03:04:39.793 --> 03:04:42.914]  So this isn't, this is not an impossibility.
[03:04:43.535 --> 03:04:44.497]  I don't think so.
[03:04:53.863 --> 03:04:58.407]  Austere, incredible veneer, but she still has to talk to the people.
[03:04:58.688 --> 03:05:00.889]  Their biggest problem is how do we avoid debates?
[03:05:00.930 --> 03:05:03.332]  This debate controversy is nonsense.
[03:05:03.352 --> 03:05:08.596]  Donald Trump never agreed to a debate with Kamala Harris on September 10th at ABC.
[03:05:08.997 --> 03:05:10.858]  He agreed to debate Joe Biden then.
[03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:14.502]  Joe Biden's no longer in the race, so Trump does not have to withdraw.
[03:05:14.942 --> 03:05:18.165]  However, Kamala Harris did agree to debate J.D.
[03:05:18.205 --> 03:05:18.525]  Vance.
[03:05:18.585 --> 03:05:19.166]  Is that debate?
[03:05:19.566 --> 03:05:20.346]  Still on?
[03:05:20.887 --> 03:05:28.911]  Now, Kamala Harris says Trump's afraid to face me on ABC, but she won't accept an invitation from Fox.
[03:05:29.551 --> 03:05:47.820]  I say, if Donald Trump had the cojones to go into a CNN debate where the rules were completely disadvantageous to him, no live audience, giving CNN control of his microphone, two hostile moderators, he still had the courage to go in the lion's den.
[03:05:48.420 --> 03:05:57.310]  She doesn't dare go to the Fox debate, which is why she has to be constantly hit by Trump and Trump surrogates and supporters.
[03:05:57.391 --> 03:05:59.393]  As a chicken.
[03:05:59.873 --> 03:06:04.078]  When are you giving a one-on-one interview with a reporter who isn't in the tank?
[03:06:04.659 --> 03:06:06.521]  And when are you going to... No, you're right.
[03:06:06.601 --> 03:06:08.143]  Why can't she give any interviews?
[03:06:08.223 --> 03:06:08.984]  She's pathetic.
[03:06:10.839 --> 03:06:12.222]  Well, because she can't perform.
[03:06:12.342 --> 03:06:17.511]  And they're trying to do what they did with Joe Biden at the end of the 2020 campaign.
[03:06:17.571 --> 03:06:19.555]  But in that case... They're right.
[03:06:19.615 --> 03:06:21.398]  She's running a basement campaign.
[03:06:22.781 --> 03:06:23.282]  Exactly.
[03:06:23.957 --> 03:06:32.964]  They're going to try their very best to hide her because, as you saw in the two instances where she took direct questions, she mangled them.
[03:06:33.024 --> 03:06:34.566]  She cannot think on her feet.
[03:06:34.626 --> 03:06:35.686]  That's very clear.
[03:06:36.007 --> 03:06:38.048]  Without a teleprompter, I think she stopped.
[03:06:38.168 --> 03:06:38.429]  I agree.
[03:06:38.489 --> 03:06:39.449]  Roger, let's shift gears.
[03:06:39.990 --> 03:06:40.971]  What about polls?
[03:06:40.991 --> 03:06:41.851]  I know there's a million of them.
[03:06:41.871 --> 03:06:42.512]  You look at them all.
[03:06:42.532 --> 03:06:47.456]  I know we don't want to be overconfident here, but what are we seeing?
[03:06:48.494 --> 03:06:55.218]  Look, she's going to get a little tick up in the polls because just the velocity of all these stories.
[03:06:55.318 --> 03:07:08.906]  I think Trump, to a certain extent, by raising the question of her shifting ethnicity for political expediency and benefit, which is what she's been doing, I think he took a little bit of wind out of her sails.
[03:07:09.306 --> 03:07:11.587]  That's not the central point of her campaign.
[03:07:11.627 --> 03:07:14.049]  The point of her campaign is a lack of character.
[03:07:14.549 --> 03:07:21.834]  And the fact that she's called herself different things at different times to... Why doesn't he attack her on being famous for locking black people up?
[03:07:24.135 --> 03:07:29.859]  I also think the hypocrisy of her record as district attorney is going to be a part of this.
[03:07:30.259 --> 03:07:35.382]  No black person should vote for her when they look at her actual record as a prosecutor.
[03:07:35.402 --> 03:07:39.305]  Because out of a lot of bad prosecutors, she had the biggest hard-on ever for black people.
[03:07:40.302 --> 03:08:03.820]  Well, she certainly, her later rhetoric when she makes jokes about smoking marijuana and listening to Tupac and Biggie at a time that they're unknowns and they're not even recording, doesn't match her record of sending, I believe it was 5,000 African Americans to jail time for the first time, nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use.
[03:08:03.940 --> 03:08:08.944]  All people with no prior criminal records who could have been put on probation and put into drug treatment.
[03:08:09.244 --> 03:08:11.826]  And Roger, on the time we have left, come back for a full hour as soon as you want to come on.
[03:08:12.566 --> 03:08:17.050]  What about, I know you've seen the Raskin Club, we're going to have civil war, we're going to 14th Amendment Trump.
[03:08:17.490 --> 03:08:19.471]  I mean, they're admitting they're losing right there.
[03:08:19.491 --> 03:08:20.852]  What do you make of that insane statement?
[03:08:21.973 --> 03:08:23.394]  You know, he's a radical.
[03:08:23.414 --> 03:08:24.775]  His father was a communist.
[03:08:24.815 --> 03:08:25.876]  He probably is too.
[03:08:25.916 --> 03:08:29.959]  He said the most outrageous things about me without ever backing them up.
[03:08:30.079 --> 03:08:33.321]  No, sorry, I know nothing about January 6th.
[03:08:34.041 --> 03:08:35.983]  Any claim that I knew in advance about
[03:08:36.977 --> 03:08:41.840]  Participated in, condoned any illegal activity on that day is simply false.
[03:08:41.940 --> 03:08:43.621]  But he's said otherwise.
[03:08:43.681 --> 03:08:56.248]  Now, if I said what he said, if I said, no, I'm going to ignore the results of the election and we're just going to beat back Biden supporters, the FBI would storm my house again tomorrow.
[03:08:56.268 --> 03:09:02.212]  Well, he said, we're going to ignore the Supreme Court and the executive and we're going to remove Trump and have civil war.
[03:09:02.232 --> 03:09:03.753]  I mean, it's it's crazy.
[03:09:04.717 --> 03:09:06.238]  It's what he really thinks.
[03:09:06.278 --> 03:09:07.979]  I mean, they're just saying it out loud.
[03:09:08.299 --> 03:09:22.908]  He's involved with that entire group at Georgetown, the people who staged the Russian collusion hoax, the people who staged the two phony impeachments, the people who staged the theft of the 2020 election, and they're back to their old tricks.
[03:09:23.228 --> 03:09:24.629]  But he's saying it out loud.
[03:09:24.649 --> 03:09:30.653]  If I said any of that, the police would be at the door and the FBI would be two steps ahead of them.
[03:09:31.353 --> 03:09:33.015]  It's the double standard.
[03:09:33.075 --> 03:09:34.517]  I think Trump should respond to this.
[03:09:36.479 --> 03:09:42.545]  Well, you know, look, I don't want to heighten the guy's power, but he's a radical.
[03:09:42.585 --> 03:09:45.327]  But he's telegraphing what they've said.
[03:09:45.628 --> 03:09:47.610]  They're going to have civil unrest when he's elected.
[03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:49.331]  They're going to try to cause a civil war.
[03:09:49.351 --> 03:09:50.733]  They got movies out, Roger.
[03:09:51.113 --> 03:09:51.834]  It's their play.
[03:09:51.874 --> 03:09:52.695]  They're admitting it.
[03:09:53.825 --> 03:09:55.507]  OK, but Alex, let's be very clear.
[03:09:55.527 --> 03:10:00.634]  This is this is exactly what they're currently trying to charge him with in court in D.C.
[03:10:00.954 --> 03:10:03.197]  I would point out to you that the judge in the D.C.
[03:10:03.277 --> 03:10:07.923]  court is now actively moving that case in which Jack Smith
[03:10:08.484 --> 03:10:15.386]  The special prosecutor whose appointment was declared unconstitutional in a Florida court.
[03:10:15.646 --> 03:10:18.727]  It's being challenged in the circuit, will probably go to the Supreme Court.
[03:10:19.628 --> 03:10:22.729]  But it doesn't bind the other district and the other judge.
[03:10:23.049 --> 03:10:28.651]  So they're back to trying to move a trial of Donald Trump of some kind prior to this.
[03:10:28.671 --> 03:10:29.111]  No, I agree.
[03:10:29.151 --> 03:10:30.231]  They're just totally desperate.
[03:10:30.271 --> 03:10:32.772]  So if you're Trump, what do you do?
[03:10:34.953 --> 03:10:40.618]  I think you focus on the differences between you and Kamala Harris on your record.
[03:10:40.998 --> 03:10:49.786]  Talk about her responsibility for the border and talk about the impact of that in terms of crime, death.
[03:10:51.147 --> 03:11:04.522]  You have to point out that she wants US taxpayers to pay for every dollar of health care for the 20 plus illegals who are in this country.
[03:11:05.322 --> 03:11:07.465]  Point out the fact that it was Joe Biden.
[03:11:07.945 --> 03:11:11.508]  Joe Biden, who said in a statement, she's a DEI hire.
[03:11:11.808 --> 03:11:13.289]  He said it, not Donald Trump.
[03:11:13.909 --> 03:11:16.331]  I think he just has to hammer all of these issues.
[03:11:16.651 --> 03:11:17.872]  She's unqualified.
[03:11:18.152 --> 03:11:33.942]  She has nothing in her record demonstrates that any of the things that are plaguing America today, inflation, the lack of affordable housing, crime and drug crisis, none of these things would change if she were president.
[03:11:34.623 --> 03:11:37.525]  It would be Barack Obama's fourth term.
[03:11:38.065 --> 03:11:39.066]  Roger, I totally agree.
[03:11:39.226 --> 03:11:41.066]  All I'm saying is we know Raskin's a minion.
[03:11:41.667 --> 03:11:42.727]  He's a high-level operative.
[03:11:42.747 --> 03:11:46.529]  Their plans are saying, don't worry, the Democrat audience, we're going to have civil war.
[03:11:47.069 --> 03:11:48.169]  We're going to 14th Amendment him.
[03:11:48.810 --> 03:11:53.511]  And we're just going to, it shows how, how brazen they are.
[03:11:53.531 --> 03:11:54.672]  They're just crazy.
[03:11:55.883 --> 03:11:56.324]  They are.
[03:11:56.384 --> 03:11:57.104]  They are brazen.
[03:11:57.124 --> 03:12:05.711]  But let's face it, so far until the judge can and finally knocked down their special counsel, they've never gotten any legal pushback.
[03:12:06.091 --> 03:12:10.054]  Donald Trump did nothing other than pursue his due process rights.
[03:12:10.134 --> 03:12:10.755]  This drives
[03:12:11.555 --> 03:12:13.016]  This drives Raskin crazy.
[03:12:13.116 --> 03:12:18.739]  Raskin wanted to expedite the lynching of Donald Trump in a court they controlled in D.C.
[03:12:18.779 --> 03:12:24.341]  and now he's furious that they can't do that because it violates Trump's due process rights.
[03:12:24.741 --> 03:12:25.802]  It's made them wild.
[03:12:25.862 --> 03:12:28.943]  They can't manipulate the system the way they want it to.
[03:12:28.963 --> 03:12:30.144]  So, they will try.
[03:12:30.164 --> 03:12:34.706]  A week before they try to kill Trump, you said, I hope they don't do it, but I agree that's their plan.
[03:12:35.106 --> 03:12:37.587]  We obviously aren't speaking this making it happen.
[03:12:37.827 --> 03:12:38.908]  It's not like abracadabra.
[03:12:39.848 --> 03:12:42.351]  Uh, but Trump's going back to Butler.
[03:12:42.892 --> 03:12:43.452]  One minute left.
[03:12:45.575 --> 03:12:49.339]  I'm not saying Trump's wrong, but my God, their only move is to kill him now.
[03:12:50.496 --> 03:12:59.339]  Look, I think he has to go back to Butler because the left, particularly Google, are desperate to get all the questions about the attempted assassination of him out of the news.
[03:12:59.739 --> 03:13:02.760]  The only way to get it back in the news is to return to Butler.
[03:13:02.780 --> 03:13:18.665]  It doesn't have to be a carbon copy of the last rally, but he should at a minimum, I think, pay his respects to the family of Corey Comparatore, the great Italian-American and firefighter who died shielding his wife and daughter from bullets from a madman.
[03:13:20.481 --> 03:13:25.710]  So Roger, bottom line, you're saying, I agree, Trump's got to roll the dice, he's got to go back to Butler.
[03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:28.411]  Look, it doesn't matter.
[03:13:28.451 --> 03:13:29.652]  He's already said he's going to do it.
[03:13:29.752 --> 03:13:32.534]  One thing about Donald Trump is he always does what he says he's going to do.
[03:13:33.514 --> 03:13:39.519]  You know, of course there is some risk, but he's a brave individual who understands that they want to erase this.
[03:13:39.559 --> 03:13:45.583]  Look, Joy Reid of MSNBC is actually on air saying there was no attempt on Trump's life.
[03:13:45.623 --> 03:13:46.744]  The whole thing was staged.
[03:13:46.784 --> 03:13:47.584]  It's a PSYOP.
[03:13:47.924 --> 03:13:50.026]  He bit a capsule that simulated that blood.
[03:13:52.774 --> 03:13:54.556]  Alex, that's insanity.
[03:13:55.658 --> 03:13:57.581]  That is true mental illness.
[03:13:57.641 --> 03:13:57.961]  It is.
[03:13:58.081 --> 03:14:00.124]  RogerStone, StoneZone.com.
[03:14:00.565 --> 03:14:01.626]  Thank you so much for the time, everybody.
[03:14:01.646 --> 03:14:03.008]  Find your show there, StoneZone.com.
[03:14:03.449 --> 03:14:04.430]  StoneZone.com.
[03:14:04.450 --> 03:14:05.332]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[03:14:06.203 --> 03:14:06.803]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:14:07.263 --> 03:14:10.964]  Obviously, silver is doing way better than gold in growth, and it's way undervalued.
[03:14:11.004 --> 03:14:11.545]  That's a fact.
[03:14:12.025 --> 03:14:14.145]  Why, then, are the central banks mainly hoarding gold?
[03:14:14.426 --> 03:14:17.006]  Well, because there's simply not enough silver, right?
[03:14:17.066 --> 03:14:28.650]  It's like, if you've got central banks that start allocating into silver, when it's $30 an ounce and they want to have it be part of their reserves, it's like, okay, there's not enough silver in the world to do that.
[03:14:29.250 --> 03:14:34.372]  Right, so they have to do gold because it's $2,400 an ounce, not $30 an ounce.
[03:14:34.793 --> 03:14:37.854]  Right, so this is why central banks own gold.
[03:14:37.874 --> 03:14:43.797]  They've got so many quadrillions of fake money, there's too much fiat to even buy the silver.
[03:14:44.337 --> 03:14:47.879]  Which I would say then means silver still will always be the thing that grows the most.
[03:14:49.079 --> 03:15:00.622]  So, historically, the numbers prove out that when gold is in a bull market, which it is, we're near all-time highs, silver does better than gold, so silver grows faster.
[03:15:01.022 --> 03:15:02.202]  And there's a reason why.
[03:15:02.642 --> 03:15:07.723]  Silver and gold both act as barometers to government distrust, right?
[03:15:08.724 --> 03:15:12.064]  The worse things get, the better financial metals do.
[03:15:12.124 --> 03:15:13.405]  They're a flight for safety.
[03:15:14.505 --> 03:15:18.167]  What silver has that gold doesn't is it's a manufacturing metal.
[03:15:18.247 --> 03:15:25.130]  It's used in industry, so in aerospace, in defense, in electronics, in solar power, electric vehicles, all of that.
[03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:30.572]  The demand for silver is through the roof, Alex, and we're just taking advantage of that.
[03:15:30.592 --> 03:15:38.956]  And imagine what silver will do with Trump being president, somebody who actually grows the economy rather than having a stagnant economy.
[03:15:39.356 --> 03:15:43.418]  The industrial need for silver is absolutely going to explode.
[03:15:43.658 --> 03:15:44.138]  No, you're right.
[03:15:44.218 --> 03:15:46.099]  Silver is the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:47.680]  That's why they call it a silver bullet.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:49.321]  People should go to kpm.com.
[03:15:49.361 --> 03:15:51.222]  Let's go right now and get silver now.
[03:15:51.242 --> 03:15:56.425]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.726 --> 03:16:04.170]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:16:07.438 --> 03:16:09.619]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:09.719 --> 03:16:16.822]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com, coming to you live from the studio here.
[03:16:16.842 --> 03:16:20.984]  I have a very, very important guest that's about to join me in a moment.
[03:16:21.004 --> 03:16:21.725]  And let me say, this is
[03:16:23.065 --> 03:16:31.287]  We're all talking about the scene war, the war that is going on around us, the move, the push towards civil war in every single country.
[03:16:31.347 --> 03:16:39.189]  Just yesterday, we spoke about the fact that the Australian Prime Minister is saying, oh, we now are raising the terrorism threat.
[03:16:39.489 --> 03:16:50.432]  And the opposition leader is saying, oh, you know, if you know anyone that is against the government, you need to report them to ASIO and the federal police.
[03:16:51.512 --> 03:17:00.597]  Similar to the comments that they made about a year ago now, that if you know anyone who believes in the last book of the Bible, you need to report them to the federal police.
[03:17:00.637 --> 03:17:08.982]  So they want everyone that's critical of government, everyone that believes in God, everyone that is part of exposing this criminal network.
[03:17:09.522 --> 03:17:15.870]  That is trying to ruin our lives, stoking civil unrest in order to bring in mass surveillance.
[03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:17.091]  And this is the thing.
[03:17:17.612 --> 03:17:18.913]  Let us not take the bait.
[03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:20.876]  Let us not take the bait.
[03:17:20.916 --> 03:17:26.202]  They want violence so that they have an excuse to bring in their digital dystopia.
[03:17:26.222 --> 03:17:27.363]  But another part.
[03:17:28.064 --> 03:17:42.593]  of this war is the unseen war, the part that is a direct consequence of the COVID injections, a direct consequence of what people have been injected with, of what's in our food, of what's in our skies.
[03:17:42.613 --> 03:17:47.216]  And you would all know that Dr Anna Mahaicha, she's been on the broadcast with me many times in the past.
[03:17:47.576 --> 03:17:50.738]  She joins us again today now with breaking news
[03:17:51.218 --> 03:17:56.721]  Graphene confirmed in dental anesthetics by the University of Colorado.
[03:17:56.761 --> 03:17:58.622]  Dr. Anna, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:17:59.743 --> 03:18:01.204]  Thank you so much for having me, Maria.
[03:18:02.463 --> 03:18:04.604]  So this is, I mean, this is this is huge.
[03:18:04.664 --> 03:18:06.584]  This is something that we've been talking about.
[03:18:07.164 --> 03:18:19.987]  You've been investigating for the past, you know, three years now, your findings of nanotechnology inside the shots, your findings of graphene in the shots, frequencies that should not be there.
[03:18:20.628 --> 03:18:23.408]  And this is now showing up in uninjected people as well.
[03:18:23.888 --> 03:18:28.109]  But now we have the University of Colorado confirming this.
[03:18:28.189 --> 03:18:30.030]  Please talk to us about these findings.
[03:18:31.198 --> 03:18:31.658]  Absolutely.
[03:18:31.738 --> 03:18:41.081]  So, you're aware that many scientists and doctors around the world have found the same self-assembling nanotechnology that was originally in the COVID shots also in these dental anesthetics.
[03:18:41.401 --> 03:18:48.302]  We found microchips that self-assemble and, you know, people initially were saying, you know, this is science fiction.
[03:18:48.422 --> 03:18:54.364]  But now, Dr. Lundstrom, he is a dentist who also works with the
[03:18:54.864 --> 03:19:14.189]  International Association for Oral Medicine and Toxicology, a large international body that represents almost 1,500 dentists in the United States, they wanted to know what our findings actually are saying and they wanted proof for it.
[03:19:14.389 --> 03:19:16.330]  So Dr. Lundstrom sent a
[03:19:16.810 --> 03:19:17.691]  We're good to go.
[03:19:32.891 --> 03:19:57.790]  And this is huge news, Maria, again, because here's another confirmation now from a university laboratory that says that the building blocks of microelectronics and self-assembling nanotechnology that are used for bidirectional telemetry to create nanorobotics are actually in
[03:19:58.570 --> 03:19:59.050]  Thank you so much.
[03:20:28.277 --> 03:20:29.198]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:20:29.258 --> 03:20:38.746]  And you know what, Dr Anna, let me just say that, you know, unfortunately, some people need to see a university confirm something that you've been screaming from the rooftops for years.
[03:20:39.547 --> 03:20:40.788]  But here we go.
[03:20:40.848 --> 03:20:41.629]  We have it now.
[03:20:42.329 --> 03:20:44.091]  University of Colorado confirms this.
[03:20:44.711 --> 03:20:51.940]  It says, Dr. Lundstrom says, we began the process of getting answers on the safety of dental anaesthetics in February of 2023.
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:21:04.834]  We began by contacting the manufacturers of the anaesthetic and in July of 23, Dr. Lundstrom partnered with the IAOMT, which is the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, to pursue testing of the anaesthetic.
[03:21:05.715 --> 03:21:17.021]  And they say that our hope is that with the weight of the IAOMT and their 1,520 members, we can accomplish our goal of answering the question on dental anaesthetic safety.
[03:21:17.061 --> 03:21:27.646]  So Dr Anna, what I want to ask you about this bombshell confirmation is, so they're confirming that they found graphene in dental anaesthetics.
[03:21:28.126 --> 03:21:39.717]  What you're seeing under the microscope with dental anaesthetics, is it the same as what you're seeing in non-organic foods, you know, major store meat, vegetables, fruit, as well as the C19 injections?
[03:21:39.817 --> 03:21:40.698]  Is it all the same?
[03:21:42.182 --> 03:21:58.025]  Well, the dental anesthetics were extremely dramatic because what we've filmed was self-assembly of these microchip-like structures within minutes, as well as I've mixed dental anesthetics with human blood, and within 20 minutes the blood was destroyed.
[03:21:58.365 --> 03:22:17.451]  The other case that I've also written about was I had a patient who had a tooth extraction, had dental anesthetics injected, and from that wound there were these rubbery clots that continued to produce themselves, 30 of them around a rubbery, pearly shape, and it would not stop.
[03:22:17.831 --> 03:22:28.338]  So over three days this continued, the dentist didn't know what to do, and the patient called me in terror and said, you know, I can't go on the rest of my life like this.
[03:22:28.438 --> 03:22:37.824]  So I had sent her for an EDTA chelation with vitamin C, which according to Moderna patents also stops the self-assembly of the nanoparticles, and in 30 minutes it stopped.
[03:22:37.864 --> 03:22:41.006]  But the fact that people are experiencing this,
[03:22:41.346 --> 03:22:46.150]  Now I'm working with biological dentists who found microrobots in dental plaque as well.
[03:22:46.290 --> 03:22:48.011]  So is it the same stuff?
[03:22:48.191 --> 03:22:49.012]  Absolutely.
[03:22:49.052 --> 03:22:54.115]  It is all part of what we found also in other vaccines and other medications.
[03:22:54.235 --> 03:23:06.164]  And we know from the literature that the health care system will make people used to the fact that cyborgs and transhuman and human augmentation is a natural thing.
[03:23:06.184 --> 03:23:09.206]  This is according to the Army document Cyborg 2050.
[03:23:10.794 --> 03:23:20.160]  Well, I was listening to an interview between Kurzweil and Neil deGrasse Tyson and Neil deGrasse Tyson was asking him, oh, you know, acting really coy about it.
[03:23:20.200 --> 03:23:27.105]  Oh, you said that by 2030, you know, everyone's going to have nanorobots in them and it's going to connect them all to the hive mind.
[03:23:27.185 --> 03:23:29.526]  And, you know, is this going to be ready before 2030?
[03:23:29.566 --> 03:23:32.548]  And Kurzweil was saying, yeah, no, we're ready.
[03:23:32.908 --> 03:23:34.089]  We're going to be ready to launch 2030.
[03:23:34.709 --> 03:23:38.232]  You don't launch something like a global AI hive mind.
[03:23:38.832 --> 03:23:39.733]  We're good to go.
[03:23:56.944 --> 03:24:00.408]  Before that date, really, 2030 is the year that they perfect it.
[03:24:00.768 --> 03:24:09.778]  You recently wrote an article about Kurzweil's writings and you were saying, what did he say about nanorobots and the singularity?
[03:24:09.818 --> 03:24:11.500]  Talk us through that a little bit, Dr Mahecha.
[03:24:12.924 --> 03:24:19.665]  So, Kurzweil, he really is one of the leaders of this technocratic transformation of humanity.
[03:24:20.685 --> 03:24:29.667]  These people call themselves futurists, and what they want to do again is use nanorobots that would repair our tissues from the inside.
[03:24:29.707 --> 03:24:40.169]  They would swarm through our blood, but then also pass the blood-brain barrier and upload our thoughts and the digital copy of our brain.
[03:24:40.749 --> 03:24:41.129]  All right.
[03:25:02.525 --> 03:25:15.588]  Recently, you know, the University from Argentina, Dr. Marcela Sangorin and Lorena de Blasi, they have provided bombshell evidence, again, absolutely confirming.
[03:25:16.348 --> 03:25:25.590]  They have investigated COVID injections from around the world, found graphene in all of them, including in Sputnik, including in Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca.
[03:25:26.050 --> 03:25:26.090]  As
[03:25:47.572 --> 03:25:49.033]  Thank you so much.
[03:26:09.890 --> 03:26:10.270]  All right.
[03:26:29.275 --> 03:26:29.856]  This is the point, Dr Mahajan.
[03:26:29.876 --> 03:26:32.018]  We read their documents and we think, gosh, these people are lunatics.
[03:26:46.796 --> 03:26:52.262]  You know, saying humans are hackable animals, they're going to be useless, we're just going to drug them and give them video games.
[03:26:53.203 --> 03:27:02.292]  This is how little these people think about humanity and you're here documenting the fact that they've already started with this transition.
[03:27:02.392 --> 03:27:08.739]  I want to know, Dr Mahecha, from your estimation and from all of your research and the patients that you're treating, by the way,
[03:27:09.139 --> 03:27:22.234]  Because you've told me, you've told me some of these people have experienced some really strange phenomenon, like hearing, go and get your booster, hearing that sort of, I guess, voice to skull, some of these people are experiencing this.
[03:27:22.594 --> 03:27:25.437]  And so I want to know, how likely is it that...
[03:27:26.705 --> 03:27:30.189]  A huge portion of humanity now has this technology in them.
[03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:40.119]  We know that the Rand Corporation says we can manipulate people and coerce them to do things that they would not normally want to do once this technology is inside of them.
[03:27:40.179 --> 03:27:48.107]  How likely is it that humans are being engineered through this technology right now to achieve things like civil unrest, for example?
[03:27:49.463 --> 03:27:51.504]  It's already happening everywhere.
[03:27:52.004 --> 03:28:03.089]  We know from around the world, from scientists, including myself, that the blood of everyone is contaminated with the self-assembling nanotechnology, the synthetic biology, these mesogen microchips.
[03:28:03.529 --> 03:28:08.431]  I have myself filmed a self-assembly of microelectronics in human blood.
[03:28:08.451 --> 03:28:14.874]  I found it in many different medications, including Enbrel, which the literature confirms that microelectronics are in there.
[03:28:15.314 --> 03:28:27.362]  And so we know, for example, from Rwanda that the civil unrest there was induced by directed energy weapons, that it was manipulating people through mind control.
[03:28:27.663 --> 03:28:30.605]  We know that the Los Angeles riots were really
[03:28:31.605 --> 03:28:31.906]  All right.
[03:28:51.969 --> 03:28:52.329]  Thank you.
[03:29:10.339 --> 03:29:13.481]  Work performance, but from now on we will have a thought police.
[03:29:13.782 --> 03:29:18.645]  So this technology is Orwellian, but it's already happening.
[03:29:18.705 --> 03:29:26.611]  We know Newsweek just had a big article talking about remote control mice, but they've done this for over 20 years.
[03:29:26.851 --> 03:29:33.556]  The CIA has had their mind control program, research program since 2040, I'm sorry, since 1940 with MK Ultra and all of these
[03:29:37.879 --> 03:29:51.328]  MK and Naomi's secret ways of controlling people's minds and controlling all kinds of societies, groups, political activists, being able to dissuade them from certain decisions.
[03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:56.832]  This is all under the umbrella of social engineering, and it's absolutely happening.
[03:29:56.852 --> 03:30:03.136]  And if you look at the personality changes of the COVID injections, everybody's talking about how people have changed.
[03:30:03.456 --> 03:30:06.117]  Well, it is through this brain-computer interface.
[03:30:06.517 --> 03:30:10.099]  You literally have created a ton of Matans now.
[03:30:11.139 --> 03:30:16.161]  I'm hoping you can jog my memory, Dr. Mahaicha, because it's just escaping me right now.
[03:30:16.661 --> 03:30:19.903]  The gentleman who gave that presentation to the U.S.
[03:30:19.943 --> 03:30:21.383]  military about
[03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:40.753]  There was Dr. Robert Duncan, he was a CIA whistleblower also and an army whistleblower, who also discussed how this mind control and cybernetic hive mind is already existing and how the CIA is using it.
[03:30:41.113 --> 03:30:54.587]  But we also have Dr. James Giordano who discusses that neurotechnology is the demi-urge, really, and that in the wrong hands it can be used to create and to manipulate entire societies, which is exactly what is happening.
[03:30:54.928 --> 03:30:56.590]  There's so much social engineering.
[03:30:56.690 --> 03:30:57.611]  We know that it is.
[03:30:57.911 --> 03:30:58.812]  It's pharmacology.
[03:31:00.974 --> 03:31:14.086]  It's electromagnetic, it's micro weapons, it's ultrasonic weapons, it's brain manipulation, and we have the proof in the blood that there's bidirectional telemetry going on.
[03:31:14.186 --> 03:31:16.027]  Clearly, nanosensors everywhere.
[03:31:16.848 --> 03:31:17.649]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:31:18.109 --> 03:31:22.353]  James Giordano is the one that I was thinking of, and I wrote it just before you said it.
[03:31:24.733 --> 03:31:32.614]  Spoken about, I've actually aired some of his public speeches that are on YouTube on this very broadcast.
[03:31:33.114 --> 03:31:35.655]  And that is the stuff that's on YouTube, mind you.
[03:31:35.715 --> 03:31:47.657]  That's the stuff that they, that's declassified, where they are talking about how they can, he can just lace the top of a pen, for example, go and meet with the leader of a resistance and completely dismantle a resistance.
[03:31:47.937 --> 03:31:49.197]  Now that is some years ago.
[03:31:49.257 --> 03:31:52.318]  Imagine what it is now that they have, I mean,
[03:31:53.098 --> 03:31:55.021]  Who knows how far they've come with smart dust.
[03:31:55.301 --> 03:32:01.650]  Who knows how far they've come with, you know, what they're able to embed inside geoengineering.
[03:32:03.478 --> 03:32:08.583]  The possibilities, what I'm trying to say here, Dr. Maheitri, is the possibilities are literally endless.
[03:32:09.063 --> 03:32:21.714]  And on top of the fact that we're being socially engineered through algorithms and constant lies in the media, we now have the added element of, gee, is my neighbor actually brain controlled through nanotechnology?
[03:32:21.774 --> 03:32:22.775]  I mean, what are your thoughts on this?
[03:32:24.474 --> 03:32:26.115]  I think it's absolutely a concern.
[03:32:26.195 --> 03:32:35.738]  We know that 40 million tons of graphene is being dispersed via geoengineering operation according to whistleblowers, including polymers, including toxic heavy metals.
[03:32:35.798 --> 03:32:46.061]  The same heavy metals that we found in the shots have been found in rainwater and in aerosol samples like aluminum, like barium and other metals.
[03:32:46.161 --> 03:32:48.822]  So all of these things are part of
[03:32:49.302 --> 03:32:53.525]  This synthetic biology transformation of humanity.
[03:32:53.946 --> 03:32:55.787]  And my concern is this, Maria.
[03:32:56.147 --> 03:33:02.552]  We know that there are war drums going on with Israel, with all of these different wars in Ukraine.
[03:33:02.972 --> 03:33:09.757]  But the war that is on humanity is going on in a stealth fashion right now under people's nose.
[03:33:09.797 --> 03:33:11.698]  You can only see it with a microscope.
[03:33:12.079 --> 03:33:17.783]  And if people do not become aware about it and they start to detoxify,
[03:33:18.303 --> 03:33:27.405]  You will have a society of zombies, mind-controlled zombies, unable to understand any information.
[03:33:27.425 --> 03:33:30.226]  They can induce happiness or depression.
[03:33:30.426 --> 03:33:32.387]  You will be happy and own nothing.
[03:33:32.467 --> 03:33:33.607]  How do they do that?
[03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:44.050]  Well, it is very easy because by simply electronically controlling your brainwaves, they can induce all kinds of states from apathy, depression, torture, anything you want.
[03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:45.690]  And so I think that this is
[03:33:46.170 --> 03:33:47.451]  Extremely important.
[03:33:47.471 --> 03:33:52.793]  The concentration camps of the future are not in big gas chambers.
[03:33:52.853 --> 03:33:58.036]  They're in your home where your brain is remote controlled by artificial intelligence.
[03:33:58.436 --> 03:33:58.696]  Wow.
[03:33:59.477 --> 03:33:59.677]  Wow.
[03:33:59.737 --> 03:34:00.557]  And you're not wrong.
[03:34:00.617 --> 03:34:05.199]  We've spoken about the Policy Horizons documents many, many times on here.
[03:34:05.220 --> 03:34:08.021]  Policy Horizons Canada, Biodigital Convergence.
[03:34:08.321 --> 03:34:09.982]  I may do another revisit of that soon.
[03:34:10.642 --> 03:34:11.183]  We're good to go.
[03:34:40.462 --> 03:34:42.443]  Future described in the letter, the year is 2030.
[03:34:43.143 --> 03:34:46.945]  I have no privacy and life has never been better.
[03:34:46.985 --> 03:34:49.386]  That's WEF and Forbes publication.
[03:34:49.906 --> 03:34:55.048]  And, you know, it just says there's no privacy and some people left the cities because of the lack of privacy.
[03:34:55.068 --> 03:35:06.253]  And I guess when people think about it, they think, OK, smart city, you know, in this in this sort of somewhat digital, somewhat physical gulag because you can't leave your 15 minute zones.
[03:35:07.794 --> 03:35:09.595]  But if I just get out, I'll be okay.
[03:35:09.615 --> 03:35:12.156]  Well, what about the unseen weaponry out there as well?
[03:35:12.196 --> 03:35:15.738]  And I think that's the serious point, Dr Anna Mihaiča.
[03:35:15.958 --> 03:35:20.401]  It's not just about escaping the smart cities, it's about escaping the grid altogether.
[03:35:20.441 --> 03:35:28.986]  But if they are to push this global hive mind, which by the way is absolutely outlined by the UN, that's the letter I was referring to.
[03:35:29.026 --> 03:35:29.546]  Thank you, team.
[03:35:31.087 --> 03:35:37.629]  The UN is pushing for the AI World Society, everyone to basically transition their lives into the metaverse.
[03:35:37.829 --> 03:35:39.710]  If they are pushing that, how do we stop it?
[03:35:41.651 --> 03:35:48.813]  I think that people need to become sovereign, they need to become informed and they really need to be aware that their mind is electronically manipulated.
[03:35:48.873 --> 03:35:56.316]  So all of your smart devices are weaponry that can be used against you, from your refrigerator to your cell phone.
[03:35:56.676 --> 03:36:03.345]  We now know from Mark Steele that even the cameras in the smart cities are actually classed for laser weapons.
[03:36:03.405 --> 03:36:07.050]  They are directed energy weapons used to kill civilians.
[03:36:07.250 --> 03:36:11.896]  Sorry, Dr Mahaitre, if I can pause you there because I just recently interviewed Mark Steele.
[03:36:12.236 --> 03:36:16.438]  And he told me something fascinating about the Blade Runners in the UK.
[03:36:16.478 --> 03:36:29.464]  They're actually not charging them for taking down these cameras because of the fact that if they went to court, this is what Mark Steele says, if they went to court it would be exposed that the government is installing weaponry to be used against the citizens on the streets.
[03:36:29.664 --> 03:36:30.925]  So they're just leaving them be.
[03:36:33.506 --> 03:36:34.647]  It's unbelievable.
[03:36:34.787 --> 03:36:42.190]  And it's the same thing with, we know, you know, Dr. Francis Boyle has declared the COVID shots biological weapons of mass destruction.
[03:36:42.210 --> 03:36:46.532]  That's an affidavit of our court case that is still in Florida going on.
[03:36:46.972 --> 03:36:55.956]  And yet what you have going on is that Governor DeSantis is denying that, you know, we can tell him what to do, basically.
[03:36:55.976 --> 03:36:57.217]  It is so,
[03:36:58.297 --> 03:37:11.763]  It's dystopian, but we have to continue and fight and detoxify the body of these metals, be able to enhance our own immune system, get away from EMF as much as we can.
[03:37:12.123 --> 03:37:24.209]  I just recently did an interview with Dr. Pedro Chavez, who showed that the MAC address phenomenon actually is temporarily disabled when you walk barefoot on grass and when you ground yourself.
[03:37:25.530 --> 03:37:29.495]  This is definitely hopeful news and get out of the cities.
[03:37:30.336 --> 03:37:33.701]  These smart cities are literally concentration camps.
[03:37:33.721 --> 03:37:41.871]  They're meant to control people and it is imperative that people know about this and protect themselves.
[03:37:42.512 --> 03:37:43.793]  It's fascinating you bring that up.
[03:37:44.114 --> 03:38:03.951]  I recently did an interview with a man from Europe who looked at a population, it was a Norwegian population if I'm not mistaken, I have to go back, but he showed that although the injected population was just as high in rural areas compared to the city, everyone was equally injected.
[03:38:04.591 --> 03:38:12.797]  The cancer rates were exploding far greater in the city than they were in rural areas because there just happens to not be towers out there.
[03:38:13.117 --> 03:38:14.998]  And so it's unbelievable.
[03:38:15.379 --> 03:38:19.942]  A farmer just won a case against the 5G towers because they installed them.
[03:38:19.982 --> 03:38:21.483]  A bunch of his cows died.
[03:38:21.763 --> 03:38:26.086]  And so the court actually ruled that you have to remove the tower because it's killing his animals.
[03:38:26.346 --> 03:38:29.128]  This is not even debatable at this point.
[03:38:29.148 --> 03:38:31.450]  We've had so many experts saying,
[03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:33.391]  We need to stop 5G.
[03:38:33.511 --> 03:38:34.111]  This is terrible.
[03:38:34.131 --> 03:38:36.533]  And then they want to take us to 6G, 7G.
[03:38:37.213 --> 03:38:41.235]  You know, you can find articles that say human beings are going to be antennas for the internet.
[03:38:41.455 --> 03:38:43.356]  I mean, this is just insanity.
[03:38:43.676 --> 03:38:44.797]  We need to stop it.
[03:38:45.077 --> 03:38:53.842]  We need to not allow these people to push us over the edge to where they legalise complete and total surveillance to push us to this
[03:38:55.162 --> 03:38:57.643]  The AI World Society, we can't let them do this.
[03:38:58.023 --> 03:39:05.066]  We're almost out of time today, so I want to direct everyone to annamaheicherphd.substack.com.
[03:39:05.406 --> 03:39:07.847]  That is your substack where people can follow your work.
[03:39:07.907 --> 03:39:10.407]  I want to really encourage people to go.
[03:39:10.447 --> 03:39:14.729]  Team, if you can bring that article up one more time, the graphene confirmed in dental anesthetics
[03:39:15.109 --> 03:39:16.670]  By the University of Colorado.
[03:39:16.770 --> 03:39:24.772]  I'm going to reshare that on all my platforms as well, Dr. Mahecha, because this is just vital, vital for people to understand.
[03:39:24.872 --> 03:39:32.354]  It's not just, you know, the fringe conspiracists saying that we now have the University of Colorado's confirmation.
[03:39:32.634 --> 03:39:33.895]  Final words, Dr. Mahecha.
[03:39:36.052 --> 03:39:43.254]  Thank you so much for covering this and your courage in all of this, because this information is needed to save humanity.
[03:39:43.334 --> 03:39:47.435]  Everybody needs to know it and we need to start just broadcasting it everywhere.
[03:39:47.495 --> 03:39:49.255]  So thanks so much for your contribution.
[03:39:49.595 --> 03:39:50.596]  Absolutely agree with you.
[03:39:50.636 --> 03:39:51.736]  Thank you so much for your time.
[03:39:51.776 --> 03:39:54.817]  And here's the thing, guys, we can't trust the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:39:54.877 --> 03:39:56.317]  We can't trust the governments.
[03:39:56.677 --> 03:40:01.818]  You know, Biden released a nanotechnology vaccine budget.
[03:40:01.878 --> 03:40:03.899]  He's included this in his budget.
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:08.581]  With an admission that COVID is a nanotechnology vaccine.
[03:40:08.621 --> 03:40:12.063]  So we cannot let these people get away with this.
[03:40:12.103 --> 03:40:13.764]  Thank you all for joining me today.
[03:40:13.844 --> 03:40:15.385]  Share this broadcast everywhere.
[03:40:15.705 --> 03:40:19.867]  Continue supporting InfoWars, one of the most important networks in the world.
[03:40:20.427 --> 03:40:21.868]  I'm Maria Z and I'll see you soon.
[03:40:22.348 --> 03:40:24.970]  Alex Jones here with a call of action.
[03:40:25.210 --> 03:40:29.832]  A call to action for all the Patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[03:40:30.453 --> 03:40:32.614]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[03:40:33.334 --> 03:40:43.437]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation, and that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[03:40:43.897 --> 03:40:50.059]  And I'm asking you now, at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[03:40:50.979 --> 03:40:59.645]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[03:40:59.845 --> 03:41:08.951]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[03:41:09.331 --> 03:41:10.552]  These are very, very popular.
[03:41:10.592 --> 03:41:12.913]  And I went looking up online, it is very, very popular.
[03:41:13.494 --> 03:41:15.215]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[03:41:15.415 --> 03:41:18.437]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[03:41:18.897 --> 03:41:22.318]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:41:22.779 --> 03:41:23.819]  Best group out there.
[03:41:24.119 --> 03:41:24.879]  Highest ratings.
[03:41:25.420 --> 03:41:26.300]  Amazing prices.
[03:41:26.340 --> 03:41:26.800]  The best.
[03:41:27.020 --> 03:41:31.102]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[03:41:31.622 --> 03:41:39.345]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here in your store.
[03:41:40.445 --> 03:41:41.266]  And they kicked him back.
[03:41:42.535 --> 03:41:46.137]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[03:41:46.437 --> 03:41:57.604]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[03:41:58.124 --> 03:42:06.489]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[03:42:06.809 --> 03:42:07.829]  They're amazing cards.
[03:42:07.869 --> 03:42:08.770]  It's got original art I came up with.
[03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:10.310]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[03:42:10.330 --> 03:42:14.692]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[03:42:14.712 --> 03:42:15.933]  You'll have a historical memento.
[03:42:30.018 --> 03:42:39.163]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[03:42:39.523 --> 03:42:40.823]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[03:42:41.484 --> 03:42:44.365]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[03:42:44.945 --> 03:42:47.947]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[03:42:48.307 --> 03:42:53.149]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:55.631]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[03:42:56.431 --> 03:42:58.432]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[03:42:58.912 --> 03:43:02.395]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[03:43:02.495 --> 03:43:03.035]  I want to be clear.
[03:43:03.596 --> 03:43:05.777]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[03:43:05.798 --> 03:43:06.598]  That's not what this is.
[03:43:06.618 --> 03:43:07.659]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[03:43:08.259 --> 03:43:21.350]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:22.551]  I know you don't want to do that.
[03:43:23.271 --> 03:43:26.274]  This cost, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[03:43:27.074 --> 03:43:28.415]  Something like that, $10 or $11.
[03:43:28.956 --> 03:43:33.639]  And so the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[03:43:33.679 --> 03:43:36.822]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[03:43:37.342 --> 03:43:40.505]  So get your collectible card, your piece of art,
[03:43:40.905 --> 03:43:45.008]  With a little piece of gold in it today, and you will help keep us on air.
[03:43:45.389 --> 03:43:46.490]  The decision is yours.
[03:43:46.850 --> 03:43:47.971]  This is a limited edition.
[03:43:48.571 --> 03:43:52.895]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[03:43:53.595 --> 03:44:03.844]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[03:44:04.244 --> 03:44:13.132]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[03:44:13.532 --> 03:44:14.373]  Thank you for your support.
[03:44:14.753 --> 03:44:16.395]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
