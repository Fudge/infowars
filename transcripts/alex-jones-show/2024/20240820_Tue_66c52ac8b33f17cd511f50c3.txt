[00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.167]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:32.887]  Today.
[00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.288]  This is our town.
[00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:42.149]  We've got steel in our spines, iron in our veins, and hope in our hearts.
[00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:49.571]  We've got the flavor, the guts, the grit, and those big shoulders you've heard so much about.
[00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:58.253]  We're a bold city, a proud city, a who you callin' second city, where 77 neighborhoods are one.
[00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:00.076]  A city of giants.
[00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:01.858]  A city with heart.
[00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.821]  A city with heroes.
[00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.424]  A sweet, sweet place to call home.
[00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:08.867]  We were born ready.
[00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:10.630]  Baptized by fire.
[00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.511]  Tireless.
[00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:12.532]  Tenacious.
[00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:13.233]  Tested.
[00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:13.614]  Trusted.
[00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:19.127]  And like someone else we know, when we fight, we win.
[00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:23.570]  We're ready to rise to the challenge, to rise to new heights.
[00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.773]  Rise, rise, rise, up, up, and away we go.
[00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:34.176]  Hey, make some noise so we can hear you, America!
[00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:38.078]  Welcome to Chicago!
[00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.691]  Back us!
[00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.572]  All we do is deliver victory!
[00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.995]  You want war?
[00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:52.895]  You got it!
[00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:12.919]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:22.546]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS An Anaconda Burrock's favorite pet Get him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:35.055]  Joan Rivers said it's true Under the dress it's become unglued Put it back on now Big Mike's gonna let it show Tonight
[00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:43.136]  Big Mike will have live coverage of the DNC.
[00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:55.010]  I'm Paul Harvey.
[00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.834]  If I were the devil.
[00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:02.421]  If I were the Prince of Darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:09.547]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:10.968]  Thee.
[00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:15.517]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:19.459]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.780]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.581]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.403]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:27.384]  Do as you please.
[00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:29.985]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:33.888]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:37.890]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.552]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.794]  Our father, witch art in Washington.
[00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:45.836]  And then I'd get organized.
[00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:51.921]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.104]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:57.105]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:00.168]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:02.330]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:13.939]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.864]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:23.507]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:27.670]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the
[00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:29.913]  Discipline emotions just like those run wild.
[00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:35.401]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:40.848]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:44.353]  And in his own churches I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:51.182]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:58.970]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:02.194]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:03.415]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:04.736]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:05.898]  This isn't a game!
[00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:07.860]  In hard work, in patriotism.
[00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:21.915]  Well, last night, myself and the Intrepid crew was up here till 11.30 or so, Central, 12.30 Eastern, watching the first night of the DNC so you don't have to.
[00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:23.756]  We had a lot of viewers.
[00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:29.520]  Nothing compared to when we covered the RNC, but we had a lot of people tuning in, but it was just a train wreck.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.484]  It was just a bunch of parrots repeating lies over and over and over again.
[00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:36.905]  It was horrible.
[00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.175]  And of course, we just had the farewell address of Joe Biden, and you had his molested daughter introducing him.
[00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.236]  It was quite the train wreck.
[00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:51.480]  Tonight, you're going to have Big Mike, Obama, and a bunch of others.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.541]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.883]  And it just gets more disgusting throughout the week.
[00:05:55.923 --> 00:06:00.667]  Hillary Clinton came out of her spider hole last night saying, lock up Trump.
[00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:14.518]  But the big takeaway was, everything they say Trump's doing, or did, inflation, crime, open borders, they said Trump's behind the inflation, crime, open borders.
[00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:26.463]  They said Trump wants to lock everybody up and put them in prison camps, as the Democrats are all over the news, pushing for that, supporting that, promoting that.
[00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:29.725]  I mean, it was really, really chilling.
[00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:32.972]  And so I want to go through all these false claims.
[00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:38.036]  They also came back and said that he said white supremacists are very fine people.
[00:06:38.176 --> 00:06:40.738]  Even Snopes says that's just not true.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.021]  And then they said Trump wouldn't visit.
[00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:48.663]  First they said he said soldiers are dumb suckers.
[00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:49.364]  Never said that.
[00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:50.244]  It's totally made up.
[00:06:50.304 --> 00:06:50.745]  No proof.
[00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:51.285]  No video.
[00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:51.705]  No nothing.
[00:06:52.926 --> 00:06:58.010]  And then they said he wouldn't visit the graves at a World War II memorial as president, which he did do.
[00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:06.531]  So it's just giant whopper lies on top of giant whopper lies.
[00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:10.594]  But what I want to start with is clips 11 and 17.
[00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:20.061]  This is Biden claiming that Trump called troops suckers and losers.
[00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.783]  And then I'm going to cut directly to Biden a few years ago.
[00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:28.994]  To the troops' faces, calling them dumbasses.
[00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:36.421]  And then we've got 8-13, and that is Michigan State Rep.
[00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:45.268]  Mallory McMorrow at the DNC lamenting that President Trump could even weaponize the Department of Justice and go after his political opponents.
[00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:51.434]  That's like a shark saying to a
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.341]  Kids swimming in the ocean, you could be a great white shark and bite me and, you know, claiming the kid's a great white shark.
[00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.362]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:05.403]  Or a cobra claiming that a parrot or something is a cobra.
[00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:07.923]  I don't even know the right analogy for this.
[00:08:10.544 --> 00:08:11.144]  It's insane.
[00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:16.745]  And that ties in with Raskin, who's one of the brains of the globalist operation.
[00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:21.494]  And we've got Raskin saying that J.D.
[00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:30.062]  Vance had to replace Pence as the VP pick, but that has nothing to do with reality, because Trump tried to kill Pence.
[00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:42.061]  And he went on in his speech to say Trump is guilty of insurrection and commanded it, so he is disqualified from the presidency.
[00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:44.343]  He's not been indicted for January 6th.
[00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:45.443]  He's not been arrested.
[00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:46.984]  He's not been convicted.
[00:08:47.124 --> 00:08:48.385]  It's a giant lie.
[00:08:49.526 --> 00:09:03.615]  And I know our general audience knows they're liars, but it's just, to look at the crowd, most of them paid social influencers and Democrat Party operatives, but still, it was like they were in rapture.
[00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:12.145]  Watching paint dry or a dead animal rot in the sun, I don't know the right parallel.
[00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:17.469]  But I mean, there's even Snopes, literally run by Soros, says, no, Trump did not call neo-Nazis and white supremacists very fine people.
[00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.070]  I mean, it's just not true.
[00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:21.932]  White supremacists, they're bad.
[00:09:21.992 --> 00:09:22.853]  They're not good.
[00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:25.795]  Some of the people on the left side were, you know, good people.
[00:09:25.835 --> 00:09:27.076]  Some of the left side were Antifa.
[00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:27.756]  They were bad.
[00:09:28.477 --> 00:09:30.959]  But there were also just some people that came to see what was going on.
[00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:35.929]  And, you know, they were very fine people and they were just there, you know, pressing others who got attacked.
[00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:37.329]  I mean, that's basically the quote.
[00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:38.049]  You've seen it before.
[00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:41.350]  I could play it again, but what is the point of that?
[00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:55.092]  So election denier Jimmy Raskin humiliates, let's put that back on screen, please, humiliates himself after freezing during DNC speech.
[00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:58.593]  Yeah, he is a real, a real joke.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.922]  His father is a famous top communist that supported death camps in Russia.
[00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:10.284]  And I've been personally persecuted by this guy, so has Owen Schroer and many others.
[00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:12.905]  He is a monster.
[00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:19.108]  But I want to dovetail 8 and 13 with last night's special report, because I know most of you didn't watch last night, and I don't blame you.
[00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:25.631]  And that deals with breaking Democrats' announced plan to put conservatives in re-education camps.
[00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:34.002]  Rob Dews saw me kind of talking about this yesterday, playing a few clips, so he thought to condense it down to five minutes.
[00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:47.176]  And it's powerful, and people need to see this, in comparison to them claiming we want to put them in re-education camps.
[00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:47.236]  No!
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.282]  If the globalists would just stop their crimes, we'd give them amnesty.
[00:10:52.342 --> 00:10:54.044]  Or they would just leave the country.
[00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:55.925]  Or we could put them on an island like Napoleon.
[00:10:56.746 --> 00:10:58.167]  But they're average minions.
[00:10:58.187 --> 00:10:59.468]  We just want to wake up.
[00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:12.858]  But we do have a responsibility to not persecute, but prosecute the deep state for the illegal surveillance and the tyranny and the rigged courts and the rest of it.
[00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:16.941]  But that's just the leadership of the deep state globalists.
[00:11:17.796 --> 00:11:19.497]  Maybe a few hundred people need to go to prison.
[00:11:20.758 --> 00:11:25.281]  The ones that ordered the DNA testing to stop, even outside of law, so they could smuggle kids across.
[00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:29.244]  Yeah, the folks that gave those orders, like Mayorkas, under the prison.
[00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:34.168]  Anthony Fauci, that ran the whole COVID hoax, under the prison.
[00:11:34.508 --> 00:11:35.949]  Bill Gates, under the prison.
[00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:37.550]  Hillary Clinton, under the prison.
[00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:39.712]  And, you know, a few hundred of them.
[00:11:40.452 --> 00:11:42.854]  They're the ones that are commanding and controlling this whole thing.
[00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:46.377]  I mean, the documents have come out, they're all out in the open, but
[00:11:47.179 --> 00:12:01.607]  No, no, the left, and this is happening all over Europe and the UK and Australia, are emptying out violent prisoners, I have it in the news today, and Islamists and others, and rapists, and murderers, and putting non-violent people in for legal speech.
[00:12:02.147 --> 00:12:03.548]  But they redefine it as terrorism.
[00:12:04.529 --> 00:12:08.631]  So, very, very, very, very, very, very serious situation.
[00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:10.392]  But the worm is turning.
[00:12:10.412 --> 00:12:14.014]  UK woman arrested for silent prayer wins payout and apology.
[00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:19.379]  She prayed a hundred yards from an abortion clinic, quietly.
[00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:23.680]  And then there's a bunch of other good things that are happening for pro-free speech.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.960]  We'll be getting to that.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.821]  Huge developments in Russia and Ukraine, the Middle East, the economy, world events.
[00:12:33.022 --> 00:12:35.502]  We have some big guests joining us today.
[00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:45.024]  We did that deep dive with some very intelligent folks that have been highly recommended by Roger Stone and the Trump campaign, former military officers, who put together
[00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:48.641]  Who actually runs the Deep State.
[00:12:49.262 --> 00:13:04.087]  They're coming back today with another guest, a colonel, to do the deep dive on some of the other facets of who this group is, bipartisan but mainly Democrat, and what they're planning, how they interface with these foreign organizations and criminal groups.
[00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:06.128]  So that's all coming up.
[00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:09.649]  But I know almost all of you know it's a lie.
[00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:14.638]  That inflation is lower under Biden than it was under Trump.
[00:13:14.698 --> 00:13:17.840]  It's about three times what it was under Biden than it was under Trump.
[00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:25.626]  And I know you know that Kamala Harris is where the borders are and they got rid of the border, but they've now come out and said none of that's true.
[00:13:26.487 --> 00:13:27.428]  Trump destroyed the border.
[00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:30.290]  Trump created the inflation.
[00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:33.692]  I mean, Trump's done it all.
[00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:37.596]  But first, here is Biden with the old lie.
[00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:39.197]  He's really pissed off.
[00:13:40.678 --> 00:13:43.860]  That Trump is saying bad things about the troops.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.321]  Here it is.
[00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:55.028]  We know from his own chief of staff, the four-star General John Kelly, that Trump, when in Europe, would not go to the grave sites in France.
[00:13:56.629 --> 00:14:03.734]  The brave service members who gave their lives to this country, he called them suckers and losers.
[00:14:04.074 --> 00:14:05.555]  Who in the hell does he think he is?
[00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:07.877]  Who does he think he is?
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.301]  There's no words for a person.
[00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:20.702]  There are not the words of a person not worthy of being Commander-in-Chief.
[00:14:21.122 --> 00:14:21.602]  Period.
[00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.803]  Not then, not now, and not ever.
[00:14:26.683 --> 00:14:27.423]  I mean that.
[00:14:28.643 --> 00:14:30.044]  I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[00:14:30.084 --> 00:14:31.564]  He's so pissed that Trump destroyed him in the debate.
[00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:36.145]  Angry old pedophile.
[00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:40.386]  This is no Commander-in-Chief should ever bow down to a dictator.
[00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:43.210]  The way Trump bows down to Putin.
[00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:56.455]  I never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris will never bow down.
[00:14:56.955 --> 00:14:58.616]  I have incredibly good judgment.
[00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:00.997]  One, I married Jill.
[00:15:01.757 --> 00:15:04.458]  And two, I appointed Johnson to the Academy.
[00:15:04.478 --> 00:15:05.559]  I just want you to know that.
[00:15:06.719 --> 00:15:08.460]  Clap for that, you stupid bastard.
[00:15:10.322 --> 00:15:13.124]  So he's actually calling the military stupid bastards.
[00:15:14.865 --> 00:15:16.486]  Basically exactly what he says Trump did.
[00:15:16.526 --> 00:15:18.767]  Now, I'm going to play these clips back to back.
[00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:21.809]  This is the Michigan Democrat Rep.
[00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:32.915]  This is Raskin saying that Trump wanted to kill Pence and the whole speech says he's guilty of insurrection and 14th Amendment and all this other stuff.
[00:15:33.595 --> 00:15:36.097]  And then I'm going to go into this very important special report
[00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:45.914]  With just a smattering of Democrats talking about putting us in camps, re-educating us, how we're terrorists because we're conservatives or populists or Christians.
[00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:46.575]  Here it is.
[00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:57.598]  Under Project 2025, Donald Trump would be able to weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political opponents.
[00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:03.960]  He could even turn the FBI into his own personal police force.
[00:16:06.886 --> 00:16:12.249]  That is not how it works in America!
[00:16:12.669 --> 00:16:13.029]  J.D.
[00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:22.794]  Vance, do you understand why there was a sudden job opening for Running Mate on the GOP ticket?
[00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:27.337]  They tried to kill your predecessor!
[00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:33.448]  I would love everybody who's a Republican to get down.
[00:16:33.608 --> 00:16:35.990]  When they say, oh we hate America, no we don't.
[00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:36.630]  We hate you!
[00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:38.211]  We love America!
[00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.152]  We hate you!
[00:16:39.272 --> 00:16:40.513]  It's not good to hate anyone.
[00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:41.614]  I don't hate anyone.
[00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:45.876]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[00:16:45.956 --> 00:16:52.581]  If you were an elected official, do you think it might be a good idea to like put these Republican Trumps supporting QAnon voters in like re-education facilities and stuff?
[00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:53.802]  Yeah, re-educate them?
[00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:58.665]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.624]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:15.636]  But I also think some of them are believing the garbage that they are being fed 24-7 on the internet, by their constituents, and they bought into this big lie.
[00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:23.284]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:31.813]  And the bottom line is all of America needs programming because we've all been negatively influenced by Donald Trump.
[00:17:32.273 --> 00:17:33.855]  There are millions of Americans
[00:17:35.732 --> 00:17:42.159]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.583]  It's as if they're members of a cult.
[00:17:46.683 --> 00:17:55.232]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized people.
[00:17:56.052 --> 00:18:01.638]  And sadly, so many of those extremists, those mega extremists, take their marching orders from Donald Trump, who
[00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:23.322]  Has no credibility left by any measure.
[00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:30.574]  He's only in it for himself He's now defending himself in civil actions and criminal actions and when do they break with him?
[00:18:30.594 --> 00:18:33.299]  You know because at some point he
[00:18:34.065 --> 00:18:37.868]  You know, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of the cult members.
[00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:43.731]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:55.199]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:18:57.683 --> 00:19:06.833]  Well, we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[00:19:07.734 --> 00:19:14.082]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate, that are die-hard capitalists?
[00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:17.806]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:26.991]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:29.393]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:19:29.913 --> 00:19:31.814]  So I have the solution.
[00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:44.344]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not talking about, well, hesitants, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[00:19:45.797 --> 00:19:49.000]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.282]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[00:19:54.004 --> 00:19:54.644]  Immigrants.
[00:19:55.004 --> 00:20:02.530]  Quite honestly, you know, the health sector doesn't know what to do because this is now first and foremost a political problem.
[00:20:03.671 --> 00:20:11.638]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:13.019]  We're going to have to bring in
[00:20:14.412 --> 00:20:19.958]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[00:20:20.098 --> 00:20:32.592]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[00:20:32.652 --> 00:20:35.155]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:44.113]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[00:20:45.174 --> 00:20:50.857]  200,000 Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[00:20:51.358 --> 00:21:04.826]  And so this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives,
[00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:09.799]  The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:18.542]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[00:21:18.562 --> 00:21:22.383]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions.
[00:21:23.263 --> 00:21:24.343]  Civil war conditions.
[00:21:26.044 --> 00:21:29.805]  So, from last night, here's Hillary saying walk.
[00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:37.119]  Trump up, and then we've got Steve Kerr, the basketball coach, tells Trump to go night-night.
[00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:42.141]  So it's all very aggressive, violent rhetoric.
[00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:43.061]  They already tried to kill him.
[00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:47.163]  And they're trying to kill America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:47.884 --> 00:21:48.464]  Here they are.
[00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:57.288]  As a prosecutor, Kamala locked up murderers and drug traffickers.
[00:21:58.141 --> 00:22:03.806]  She will never rest in defense of our freedom and safety.
[00:22:04.927 --> 00:22:07.909]  Donald Trump fell asleep at his own trial.
[00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.633]  And when he woke up, he made his own kind of history.
[00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:18.318]  The first person to run for president with 34 felony convictions.
[00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:22.502]  You're the crook and everybody knows you're rich.
[00:22:24.383 --> 00:22:25.144]  Look at these idiots.
[00:22:27.438 --> 00:22:31.741]  As Vice President Kamala sat in the Situation Room.
[00:23:00.849 --> 00:23:15.986]  And, and, after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump, night night!
[00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:17.988]  Thank you!
[00:23:29.383 --> 00:23:32.184]  Then, of course, you had all the weirdness of AOC.
[00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:42.530]  And really, the big takeaway is most of the people on the stage were obviously on a couple of hits of Adderall, like that state rep that kept sticking her tongue out like a cobra.
[00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:53.476]  Now, coming up... Coming up...
[00:23:54.790 --> 00:24:02.036]  We're going to be looking at the economy for 30 minutes and the big developments there and tying that into their claims.
[00:24:02.096 --> 00:24:06.179]  And I have the clips that inflation is way down and better than under Trump.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.802]  And of course, all of that is a manifest line.
[00:24:10.822 --> 00:24:17.747]  And then we're going to look at some of the things Biden in his last months in office that we're still in the election is doing with what, 76?
[00:24:17.828 --> 00:24:20.810]  How many days until the election?
[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:20.810]  76?
[00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.011]  75?
[00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.011]  Let's put that on screen for TV viewers.
[00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:38.660]  Biden administration is rushing to roll out a national digital ID plan so the illegals can vote and so they can track everything we do for 76 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, 14 seconds for the most important election in world history.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.521]  And then there's the 79 days tacked onto that once he is president-elect.
[00:24:44.581 --> 00:24:49.923]  And again, despite all their fraud, all their dead people voting, they believe the landslide's so big
[00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:51.387]  We're good to go.
[00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:21.172]  We're also going to look at new developments with Russia, offer safe haven for people trying to escape Western liberal ideals.
[00:25:22.073 --> 00:25:25.374]  And a bunch of publications came out and said, Alex Jones says he's moving to Russia.
[00:25:25.914 --> 00:25:27.034]  I said, no such thing.
[00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:28.875]  And that's not true.
[00:25:29.856 --> 00:25:39.339]  But for homeschoolers and Christian groups all over Europe and other areas, they're having their children taken and who aren't politically active, so they're not going to save their own countries.
[00:25:39.899 --> 00:25:40.720]  It's their option.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.460]  If they wanted to go there, they can do that.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.641]  It just shows the big split
[00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:54.844]  Between Russia and the West and the things being promoted by the left, but I just love how the corporate media yet again lies and says that I said something I didn't say.
[00:25:55.784 --> 00:25:56.304]  But I get it.
[00:25:56.344 --> 00:25:56.864]  They're jealous.
[00:25:56.944 --> 00:26:06.567]  I mean, I put an X tweet out, a post out with the Russian decree in English, and last time I checked it had 12 million readers.
[00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:09.008]  So they're just jealous.
[00:26:10.422 --> 00:26:10.982]  Huffington Post.
[00:26:11.082 --> 00:26:12.543]  Alex Jones considers leaving U.S.
[00:26:12.623 --> 00:26:13.964]  and social media approves.
[00:26:14.845 --> 00:26:15.445]  That one for me.
[00:26:15.465 --> 00:26:16.686]  I hadn't seen that one.
[00:26:16.786 --> 00:26:17.826]  I saw a bunch of others.
[00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:22.169]  They're just absolute crap.
[00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:26.752]  Alex Jones's fans are intrigued by Putin's offer of sanctuary to conservatives.
[00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:29.593]  Raw story goes on to say Alex Jones is considering it.
[00:26:30.374 --> 00:26:30.854]  Not really.
[00:26:30.874 --> 00:26:36.677]  You can go read my post on X. Which, by the way, about 90
[00:26:38.564 --> 00:26:41.045]  Percent of the posts on Alex Jones are written by me.
[00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:44.127]  You can usually tell because I write them fast or use voicemail.
[00:26:44.207 --> 00:26:45.208]  There might be some typos.
[00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:49.791]  But live show feeds that are put out, I write most of those.
[00:26:49.931 --> 00:26:50.771]  The crew writes some.
[00:26:51.392 --> 00:26:55.174]  When they make a new report or something, they post to my channel under my authorization.
[00:26:55.594 --> 00:26:56.955]  And I'm not walking back.
[00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:59.736]  You guys print my post on X yesterday.
[00:26:59.757 --> 00:27:00.617]  They got 12 million views.
[00:27:01.197 --> 00:27:02.038]  I'm not walking it back.
[00:27:02.178 --> 00:27:05.920]  I asked Chase Geyser, hey, this decree was just put out.
[00:27:08.652 --> 00:27:13.815]  Go to a write-up on this and said this really is a lie in the sand of the culture war.
[00:27:13.835 --> 00:27:15.296]  And I think what he wrote was great.
[00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:18.498]  But Chase wrote that tweet that got 12 million views.
[00:27:18.538 --> 00:27:20.018]  But I didn't say I'm moving to Russia.
[00:27:20.619 --> 00:27:22.000]  I didn't say everybody should move to Russia.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.741]  Of course, Chase didn't say that.
[00:27:24.761 --> 00:27:26.622]  And it's just ridiculous.
[00:27:27.162 --> 00:27:27.823]  It's not there.
[00:27:27.863 --> 00:27:29.144]  I didn't say that.
[00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:30.704]  They want to act like I'm abandoning ship.
[00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:32.866]  Never!
[00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:35.327]  We will restore the republic.
[00:27:35.347 --> 00:27:36.428]  We will defeat the globalists.
[00:27:36.448 --> 00:27:36.828]  Stay with me.
[00:27:37.566 --> 00:27:42.272]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.

[00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.371]  You know, my kids asked me, they said, you've got to ask the president, is anything scary?
[00:28:41.891 --> 00:28:46.152]  You know, uh, well, when Michelle's mad, I get worried.
[00:28:46.173 --> 00:28:46.713]  You know Michelle.
[00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:52.534]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:07.685]  Lost my mic pack.
[00:29:10.547 --> 00:29:18.815]  Some friends of mine that were at the house that night, and I told them, I said, you're not going to believe this.
[00:29:20.896 --> 00:29:24.560]  I blew this guy twice.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.641]  You found it.
[00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:27.622]  The tip of the spear.
[00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:30.104]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:48.288 --> 00:30:02.814]  Big Mike set to speak tonight on the second night of the DNC.
[00:30:02.914 --> 00:30:07.076]  You know, the good news is people are waking up across the political spectrum.
[00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:11.578]  It's almost tripled the number of blacks, particularly black men, voting for Trump in major polls.
[00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:13.279]  Same thing with Hispanics.
[00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:20.876]  Same thing with working class Midwestern folk people everywhere, but now we're told, no, no, no, Kamala is way ahead.
[00:30:20.916 --> 00:30:24.198]  But here's what a couple of popular black podcasters had to say.
[00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:27.641]  I got rich with Trump.
[00:30:27.661 --> 00:30:28.281]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:28.341 --> 00:30:30.863]  I'm with the red team anyway, all across the board, if you know what I mean.
[00:30:30.883 --> 00:30:32.725]  So like, I always with Trump.
[00:30:32.865 --> 00:30:33.946]  I did when I was a kid.
[00:30:34.286 --> 00:30:36.547]  I like when he used to talk crazy, the Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:30:36.587 --> 00:30:38.069]  I always liked Trump.
[00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.612]  Can't tell me what he did wrong to black people.
[00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:42.093]  You n****s are brainwashed and stupid.
[00:30:42.253 --> 00:30:43.854]  I still don't know what is y'all talking about.
[00:30:43.874 --> 00:30:45.235]  Don't talk about that old Central Park.
[00:30:45.636 --> 00:30:46.917]  Because everybody thought the n****s did it.
[00:30:46.937 --> 00:30:48.538]  They got all, okay, sorry.
[00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:49.518]  It happens in life.
[00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:50.799]  What else can you name?
[00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:51.460]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.441]  They really can't.
[00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:53.081]  You're dumb.
[00:30:53.481 --> 00:30:55.223]  So like, Kamala Harris who?
[00:30:55.243 --> 00:30:57.624]  Like, I didn't know this whole four years she did nothing good.
[00:30:58.065 --> 00:30:58.485]  Right, right.
[00:30:58.525 --> 00:30:59.706]  I'm only with the red team, man.
[00:30:59.726 --> 00:31:00.126]  Come on, man.
[00:31:00.146 --> 00:31:02.628]  Everyone took a bullet and stood up and said, fight on.
[00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:03.208]  Right.
[00:31:03.288 --> 00:31:03.909]  Who's doing that?
[00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:06.330]  It could have been a whole SWAT team knocking them down from up there.
[00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.452]  That n**** took the bullet here and looked at her and said, huh?
[00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:16.039]  Well, you know, I say Trump is probably the most blackest president.
[00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:16.639]  Always been.
[00:31:16.659 --> 00:31:19.681]  He's definitely blacker than Barack Obama in the white ass.
[00:31:19.701 --> 00:31:20.181]  Come on, man.
[00:31:20.222 --> 00:31:22.363]  My name's got baby mama problems.
[00:31:22.383 --> 00:31:22.943]  Come on, champ.
[00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:23.624]  Come on, man.
[00:31:23.684 --> 00:31:25.124]  You got shot.
[00:31:25.665 --> 00:31:26.105]  Come on, man.
[00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:26.565]  What else?
[00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:27.586]  Big felon too now.
[00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:28.346]  Went to jail.
[00:31:28.646 --> 00:31:29.187]  Come on, now.
[00:31:29.347 --> 00:31:31.308]  Is that not the blackest president?
[00:31:31.748 --> 00:31:33.569]  Paid off the... You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:36.052]  And all that, yeah.
[00:31:36.112 --> 00:31:37.653]  Free Kodak, everyone.
[00:31:37.753 --> 00:31:38.994]  Free numerous n****s. Come on, man.
[00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:39.954]  Parton, Wayne.
[00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:40.455]  Come on, man.
[00:31:41.315 --> 00:31:42.096]  Free Jack.
[00:31:42.296 --> 00:31:43.817]  Hey, man, I'm f***ing Trump, man.
[00:31:43.937 --> 00:31:44.438]  I'm f***ing Trump.
[00:31:45.038 --> 00:31:45.258]  Yeah.
[00:31:59.028 --> 00:32:03.570]  Barely speaks English, sniffs children.
[00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:09.432]  And their mom's hair, too, goes the wrong way.
[00:32:10.253 --> 00:32:14.815]  When he leaves his speeches, gets lost each day.
[00:32:15.835 --> 00:32:29.134]  In the White House yard All the Dems say That we should re-elect him How can he run When walking is hard?
[00:33:04.128 --> 00:33:29.468]  All right, I'm going to get back into the DNC and all the other news and next hour I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:43.229]  But I wanted to look at the world economy right now, what real economists and numbers show, and people that have been accurate in the past predicting what's happening versus what the mainstream corporate enemy of the people media is saying.
[00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:47.571]  Gold price hits another record high on Chinese demand.
[00:33:48.932 --> 00:33:49.833]  Very important article.
[00:33:51.534 --> 00:33:52.294]  We'll do an overshot.
[00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:53.955]  Overhead shot of that.
[00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:54.715]  There it is.
[00:33:56.176 --> 00:34:00.499]  Silver set to soar on Samsung's solid-state battery breakthrough.
[00:34:03.598 --> 00:34:10.171]  We're going to look at the underlying undervalued fact of silver at $29 an ounce and why it's surging.
[00:34:11.277 --> 00:34:20.220]  We're going to look at a lot more with a quick snapshot of the balance of the hour and some of these important shots with economist Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[00:34:20.581 --> 00:34:23.362]  Doc, great to have you on with us here today.
[00:34:24.342 --> 00:34:27.003]  This is a really big ongoing development.
[00:34:27.823 --> 00:34:31.385]  Your predictions that you've been making for 10 months here on air are all coming true.
[00:34:31.765 --> 00:34:34.486]  So give us the latest technical numbers and what you're predicting comes next.
[00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:40.972]  Yeah, so fundamentally, there's always things that drive markets, right?
[00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:46.056]  When you look at a chart, there's always something that made the chart look like the chart, right?
[00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:56.044]  So I think this article about Samsung's new development is absolutely massive, Alex, when you think of the implications.
[00:34:57.724 --> 00:35:06.530]  When you look at the driver, the demand for silver, the largest user of silver is the military industrial complex, right?
[00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.471]  It's used for missiles and torpedoes.
[00:35:09.132 --> 00:35:12.894]  About 11,000 ounces in each ICBM that's shot off, right?
[00:35:12.914 --> 00:35:14.175]  And it's never reclaimable.
[00:35:14.235 --> 00:35:15.236]  It's not like aluminum.
[00:35:15.276 --> 00:35:16.937]  You can't get it back once it's done.
[00:35:17.497 --> 00:35:19.839]  So military is massive.
[00:35:20.299 --> 00:35:23.721]  Solar power is a massive user of silver.
[00:35:24.162 --> 00:35:26.183]  Electronics are used in circuit boards.
[00:35:26.483 --> 00:35:28.905]  Massive user of silver.
[00:35:30.046 --> 00:35:36.210]  Electric vehicles, fuel cell technology, a growing user, but this just changed.
[00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:43.616]  So, Samsung developed a new solid state battery for electric vehicles.
[00:35:43.756 --> 00:35:45.878]  Now, so what does this mean?
[00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:53.423]  Normally in an electric vehicle, and everyone who's had an EV, you know, is basically going around and it's like, man, I only have like a 400 mile range and it takes like,
[00:35:54.484 --> 00:36:10.129]  I don't know, it takes like 17 hours to charge the dumb thing, and you know, so this new battery has a 600 mile range, a 20 year lifespan, and it charges in 9 minutes.
[00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.390]  It's like, okay, this is a game changer.
[00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.991]  That is beyond a game changer.
[00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:17.752]  That is a civilizational shifting event.
[00:36:19.956 --> 00:36:31.847]  It's massive, and so for each electric vehicle that's going to use this battery, it's about a kilo, so 32.151 ounces of silver in each one of those solid-state batteries.
[00:36:32.287 --> 00:36:39.314]  So then, you multiply the number of electric vehicles who wouldn't use this battery, right?
[00:36:39.354 --> 00:36:42.456]  It's like, wow, this is a game-changer for the electric vehicle market.
[00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:43.217]  By the way, I want to be clear.
[00:36:43.397 --> 00:36:45.518]  I'm not against technology as long as it's pro-human.
[00:36:45.998 --> 00:36:47.139]  Fossil fuels are great.
[00:36:47.219 --> 00:36:48.419]  I love the combustion engine.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.241]  The current electric cars are not cost-effective.
[00:36:51.521 --> 00:36:52.541]  It's not about carbon.
[00:36:52.881 --> 00:36:54.442]  It's about shutting down fossil fuels.
[00:36:54.462 --> 00:36:58.084]  We don't have a replacement for fertilizer for agrarian society.
[00:36:58.144 --> 00:37:04.146]  As Elon Musk has said, we'll need fossil fuels for another hundred years regardless, but they're a bridge to the future.
[00:37:04.547 --> 00:37:07.108]  Something like this patented, proven development
[00:37:07.768 --> 00:37:15.374]  Is absolutely the answer and this will shift vehicles in the next 10 years basically almost completely to this system.
[00:37:15.394 --> 00:37:17.035]  I mean this is this is massive.
[00:37:19.037 --> 00:37:20.018]  It is massive.
[00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:21.719]  It's like a nine minute charge.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.862]  You know this is why we used to have an electric vehicle.
[00:37:24.882 --> 00:37:30.306]  We used to have a Tesla years ago and it's got rid of it because it's like I can't I mean it takes forever to charge it.
[00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:33.749]  You can't go on a long road trip with I mean it's just a pain in the butt right.
[00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:33.969]  So
[00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:37.492]  So now I have a big gas guzzling truck and I like it.
[00:37:38.072 --> 00:37:42.497]  So, so, but, but with this nine minute charge, that's insane.
[00:37:42.557 --> 00:37:57.010]  So at one kilo of silver per electric vehicle, the estimated demand will be about 16,000 metric tons of silver just for electric vehicles per year.
[00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.791]  Okay.
[00:37:57.831 --> 00:37:59.052]  Put this into perspective.
[00:37:59.572 --> 00:38:05.455]  Globally, the mining of silver is 25,000 metric tons.
[00:38:05.855 --> 00:38:14.459]  This will take 67% of all the global mining of silver in a year for one application.
[00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:18.580]  Now, electric vehicles isn't even the largest user of silver.
[00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:23.483]  Military is, for missiles and torpedoes and all of this other stuff, right?
[00:38:23.523 --> 00:38:26.044]  So then add to that solar,
[00:38:26.724 --> 00:38:32.973]  Which is a massive user of silver, and that's expected to go up by 50% over the next five years.
[00:38:32.993 --> 00:38:40.043]  It's like, look Alex, the demand for silver is greatly outstripping the supply.
[00:38:40.504 --> 00:38:42.667]  We will probably run out of silver.
[00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:50.213]  In the year 2025, which is not a bad thing for the people that own silver, right?
[00:38:50.253 --> 00:39:05.907]  Because when people like Tesla and Samsung and Sony and all these companies and Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman and all these people need silver, they don't care what price they're going to pay for it because they're just going to pass it on to the consumer.
[00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:07.348]  Let's just back off of that for a minute.
[00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:08.609]  I mean, let's quantify that.
[00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.391]  There's finite silver.
[00:39:12.455 --> 00:39:17.299]  And that's why the globalists buy gold even though silver is up even more.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.902]  There's just not enough of them for them to even park their money in it.
[00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:27.788]  And so with all these revolutionary new developments, and I follow the technology news as well, this new battery is the biggest ever.
[00:39:28.149 --> 00:39:30.030]  That alone will explode the price of silver.
[00:39:31.058 --> 00:39:33.722]  And it's then, you know, just to be baked into the cost, as you said, to consumers.
[00:39:34.102 --> 00:39:40.491]  You add everything else going on that it's an essential metal for industry, and then you add inflation to this.
[00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:43.736]  My God, what are your projections for silver, and what's the timeline?
[00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:46.882]  So, I sent you a chart.
[00:39:46.902 --> 00:39:51.565]  Now, I've agreed with this since the last nine months we've been talking.
[00:39:52.025 --> 00:39:56.188]  Now we've got other economists that are starting to say the same thing, which is really exciting.
[00:39:56.268 --> 00:40:05.313]  So, there's this chart about, it shows a pennant diagram and silver should hit $50 by the end of this year.
[00:40:05.993 --> 00:40:09.155]  Alex, it's the middle of August and it's $30 an ounce, right?
[00:40:09.195 --> 00:40:09.875]  So, going to $50, but
[00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:20.122]  I've said that we're probably going to hit 75 to 100 before this is all said and done, right?
[00:40:20.182 --> 00:40:22.203]  But this, we're just talking about this year.
[00:40:22.893 --> 00:40:32.240]  Right, so from 30 to 50, I mean, we're talking about another 40% move between now and the end of the year.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:37.003]  So when you look at that pattern, I'm not a technical chartist, I couldn't care less.
[00:40:37.484 --> 00:40:40.106]  Fundamentals always make every chart look like a chart.
[00:40:40.406 --> 00:40:47.311]  So with the inflationary pressures, the supply and demand, the unsustainable debt, the political chaos, the applications used.
[00:40:47.871 --> 00:40:54.056]  So what that chart shows that looks like a pennant is higher lows and lower highs.
[00:40:54.517 --> 00:41:00.562]  They come to a point, once it breaks through that, it really goes through the ceiling, right?
[00:41:00.602 --> 00:41:03.625]  I mean, this is how technical chartists look at it.
[00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:07.428]  So projections now are $50 by the end of the year.
[00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:09.570]  Here's what's really exciting about that.
[00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:15.655]  I sent you one other chart that's going to actually explain things further, why I'm so comfortable with saying, yeah,
[00:41:16.495 --> 00:41:19.638]  $150 an ounce now, I think is where we're going to go.
[00:41:19.698 --> 00:41:30.908]  But so there's this chart from, it's actually from usdebtclock.org, where it shows, you know, the amount of silver coming out of the ground
[00:41:31.628 --> 00:41:35.349]  You compare that to the amount of dollars that are being printed.
[00:41:35.949 --> 00:41:38.510]  So what does that say the dollar to silver ratio is?
[00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:43.011]  All else being equal, silver should be $438 an ounce, not $30.
[00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:46.672]  But this same website, usdebtclock.org, three weeks ago had silver at $250 an ounce.
[00:41:46.772 --> 00:41:49.892]  What's happened in three weeks that caused it to go from $250 to $438?
[00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:14.747]  It's stinking Biden's policies of printing money like there's no tomorrow that inflation will cause the price of any tangible good, whether it's gold, silver, real estate, gas, groceries, everything to go through the ceiling.
[00:42:15.028 --> 00:42:18.649]  So now you've got Kamala and you've talked about this quite a bit.
[00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.411]  It's like she wants to put price controls on groceries.
[00:42:22.151 --> 00:42:22.371]  Right?
[00:42:23.112 --> 00:42:24.774]  She's not looking at the root issue.
[00:42:25.094 --> 00:42:28.277]  The root issue is they're printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:31.000]  Of course, the price of groceries are going to go up.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.321]  Dr. Elliott, you're being kind.
[00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:37.166]  Von Mies Institute, Michael Savage, myself, even Trump's saying, because it's true,
[00:42:37.907 --> 00:42:47.180]  The communists and the globalists know that price-fixing destroys the low-level mom-and-pop and even mid-level companies up to, you know, $500 million companies.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.444]  Sound big to the average person, but that's seen as a smaller, medium company by the globalists.
[00:42:50.845 --> 00:42:54.369]  That will further vertically integrate the economy, just like the COVID lockdowns did.
[00:42:54.950 --> 00:43:03.175]  So we've gone from, you know, 1 tenth of 1 percent having 50 percent of the wealth 20 years ago to now 80 plus percent of the wealth is held by just a few hundred individuals.
[00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:06.717]  And they're the ones setting the global markets to consolidate power.
[00:43:06.957 --> 00:43:10.579]  So they want price fixing just like they want to cut energy back and fertilizer back.
[00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:21.023]  To drive everybody else into submission because the big central banks capitalized the Fortune 100 and the Fortune 500 and they have all the capital to recapitalize when everybody else is shut down.
[00:43:21.243 --> 00:43:29.327]  This is simple monopoly capitalism at the top of fascist crony model using communism as the ground level implementation program.
[00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:32.254]  Yeah, it is absolute communist.
[00:43:32.314 --> 00:43:33.694]  She is a communist.
[00:43:34.115 --> 00:43:34.955]  No bones about it.
[00:43:35.155 --> 00:43:37.676]  Her policies are communist policies, right?
[00:43:38.437 --> 00:43:48.801]  But what this is going to do, it's going to cause more inflation because it's going to cause the manufacturers to not even produce anything if they're penalized for not having price controls, which they can't afford it.
[00:43:49.181 --> 00:43:50.782]  So prices are going to go through the roof.
[00:43:50.822 --> 00:43:52.943]  The inflationary pressures will persist.
[00:43:53.443 --> 00:43:57.144]  This is going to be very bullish for gold and silver, which is why I bring it up.
[00:43:57.564 --> 00:43:59.904]  So $50 by the end of the year.
[00:43:59.964 --> 00:44:15.848]  So one thing, Alex, that you and I have talked about extensively is our strategy here to do a ratio trade, meaning we allocate into the faster growing metal, happens to be silver right now,
[00:44:16.508 --> 00:44:23.493]  And then ultimately we can sell off portions of that and we don't charge a commission when you liquidate to go into gold.
[00:44:23.993 --> 00:44:27.216]  Now what does that do if silver doubles the rate of growth of gold?
[00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:33.952]  Well, then you get almost twice as many ounces of gold down the road by selling silver to go into gold.
[00:44:34.032 --> 00:44:39.013]  I mean, if I can get you more ounces of gold then than I could today, that's free gold!
[00:44:39.374 --> 00:44:50.017]  So here's where this $50 silver falls right into this strategy that we're talking about, because Citibank and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs
[00:44:50.737 --> 00:44:51.398]  We're good to go.
[00:45:06.753 --> 00:45:07.234]  We're good to go.
[00:45:22.757 --> 00:45:25.159]  I'm just interrupting quickly because we have limited time, Dr. Elliott.
[00:45:25.179 --> 00:45:25.759]  I just want to be clear.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.102]  This, in my view, is the surest thing in the world economically.
[00:45:30.382 --> 00:45:33.544]  There's no perfect thing in this universe except God.
[00:45:34.085 --> 00:45:39.188]  But looking at this, and you've been saying this for years, it's all been playing out on the exact graph you basically laid out.
[00:45:39.648 --> 00:45:44.091]  This is the surest thing out there, is to get into silver and then get into gold.
[00:45:44.251 --> 00:45:47.113]  And you will tell us when you think the point is to get into gold.
[00:45:47.454 --> 00:45:52.437]  You're about to make a point, and then please answer the question, at what number do people shift out of silver into gold?
[00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:59.659]  Yeah, so today, as we speak, this ratio is at like 86 to 1, right?
[00:45:59.719 --> 00:46:03.641]  So when silver hits 50 and gold's at 3,000, we're at 60 to 1.
[00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:07.462]  That's over a 25% difference in price.
[00:46:07.962 --> 00:46:16.505]  At that point, we're going to say get rid of about 30% of your silver, roll it into gold, we compound your ounces of gold, you get more of it then than what you could have purchased today.
[00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:18.086]  History shows us
[00:46:18.766 --> 00:46:20.567]  That silver is going to be going through the roof.
[00:46:20.627 --> 00:46:27.912]  That ratio will then compress even more very rapidly, and we can do a second ratio trade at 40 to 1.
[00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:32.254]  At 40 to 1, we've basically been able to almost double your ounces in gold.
[00:46:32.815 --> 00:46:37.338]  Alex, this is happening quicker than what we thought it would, right?
[00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:42.801]  Because now you've got this excess demand for silver and very little supply.
[00:46:43.261 --> 00:46:44.902]  Gold and silver are going through the ceiling.
[00:46:45.423 --> 00:46:45.823]  Gold
[00:46:46.423 --> 00:46:48.504]  Is actually going to propel up as well.
[00:46:48.964 --> 00:47:03.248]  And all of this is going to add to our investment portfolios growth because now China, the demand for gold in China is absolutely through the roof too, because they're seeing the demise of the dollar.
[00:47:03.948 --> 00:47:08.489]  See, China is hedging itself, getting out of its treasuries, U.S.
[00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:12.310]  treasuries, going into something that's tangible, something that's real.
[00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:27.794]  This is why they're allocating tens of thousands of tons, not ounces, into gold to back their BRICS currency, which we need to spend a whole show talking about what comes next with a gold-backed BRICS currency.
[00:47:27.814 --> 00:47:28.454]  We will later this week.
[00:47:28.474 --> 00:47:30.294]  We're almost out of time, so let's explain it.
[00:47:30.334 --> 00:47:33.175]  I know most listeners get this, but for new viewers, for new listeners,
[00:47:34.443 --> 00:47:37.524]  China and the big billionaires, they know gold's going up.
[00:47:37.864 --> 00:47:42.825]  They're not even worrying about silver because there's not even enough of it out there.
[00:47:42.885 --> 00:47:43.925]  And that's in the news.
[00:47:43.945 --> 00:47:44.565]  You've broken that down.
[00:47:44.585 --> 00:47:45.045]  That's a fact.
[00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:46.485]  So they're already looking ahead.
[00:47:46.525 --> 00:47:47.005]  They don't even care.
[00:47:47.025 --> 00:47:54.367]  They're just gobbling up as much gold as possible, knowing this is about to happen, whether it's Zuckerberg or Bill Gates or you name it.
[00:47:54.447 --> 00:47:59.608]  Farmland, gold, silver, weapons stocks, medical stocks.
[00:48:00.388 --> 00:48:05.615]  And then, you know, everything else, tech, all of it is going to be obviously going down at least in the midterm.
[00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.939]  So people need to call you.
[00:48:07.959 --> 00:48:11.503]  You've got the highest ratings, the best deals on gold and on silver.
[00:48:11.864 --> 00:48:12.885]  They need to listen to you.
[00:48:12.945 --> 00:48:14.227]  It's been proven out to be right.
[00:48:14.307 --> 00:48:15.248]  Plus you're a sponsor.
[00:48:15.689 --> 00:48:17.251]  I've been offered four or five times.
[00:48:18.012 --> 00:48:18.392]  We're good.
[00:48:39.697 --> 00:48:42.059]  This is one of the surest things I've ever been about.
[00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:45.601]  Regardless of all this uncertainty, you need to be in silver right now.
[00:48:45.642 --> 00:48:46.582]  This is a no-brainer.
[00:48:46.802 --> 00:48:47.643]  People need to call 720-605-3900.
[00:48:47.763 --> 00:48:55.669]  Say Alex Jones sent you, because the more success they get, the more they're able to sponsor.
[00:48:55.929 --> 00:48:57.970]  And without him right now, we would not be in the black.
[00:48:58.271 --> 00:48:59.011]  We would be in the red.
[00:48:59.031 --> 00:49:00.152]  We would be shutting down.
[00:49:00.552 --> 00:49:02.354]  So it's a win-win on every front.
[00:49:02.394 --> 00:49:05.436]  The best place to go, the best prices, the market surging.
[00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:19.881]  And, you know, just absolutely funding this operation, a 360 total win, 720-605-3900, 720-605-3000, or KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:30.565]  KEPM.com forward slash gold, and then we get the support here with the sponsorship, and he has increased his sponsorship, and that's so vital to what we're doing.
[00:49:30.826 --> 00:49:31.886]  Doc, we've got a few minutes to break.
[00:49:32.326 --> 00:49:34.447]  Please continue and kind of put a bow on it.
[00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:41.003]  Yeah, so with the news that came out about Samsung, this is a game changer.
[00:49:41.403 --> 00:49:50.487]  With the ratio between silver and gold being at 86 to 1 today, I can't overstate the importance of people getting into silver now.
[00:49:51.218 --> 00:50:09.228]  Because with the projections of it hitting 50 by the end of the year, with gold hitting 3,000 in early 2025, Alex, this is the opportunity to get free gold down the road, and we will manage this ratio trading strategy for you.
[00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:13.631]  We'll let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, lock in these profits, right?
[00:50:13.691 --> 00:50:20.455]  And this is just a compounding ounce of strategy that I've used for 29 years in this business, right?
[00:50:20.495 --> 00:50:20.615]  So
[00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:38.570]  At this stage of the game, where the ratio is near an all-time high, and we can actually get into silver at less than $30 an ounce, real close to it, when the projection is it's going to be $50 by the end of the year, and I think it goes much higher than that.
[00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.851]  Look, that U.S.
[00:50:39.871 --> 00:50:42.253]  debt clock chart, silver should be $4.38 an ounce.
[00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:42.693]  So, if I'm 75% wrong,
[00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.071]  It's still going to do really well, right?
[00:50:51.491 --> 00:50:59.474]  So this is where we get to take advantage of these stupid inflationary policies that are ruining the global economy.
[00:50:59.994 --> 00:51:01.715]  And we don't have to participate in that.
[00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:07.437]  If we reallocate into something that's going to grow with that inflation, that's our protection and that's our hedge.
[00:51:07.797 --> 00:51:11.640]  And Doc, I've asked you to do this, and I've asked my crew, we have a limited crew, they do a fabulous job.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.401]  But so people really get it.
[00:51:13.421 --> 00:51:29.551]  We need to go back to you being first on the show 10 months ago, and then nine months ago, and eight months ago, right up to now, and show the chart each day you're on where it's at, show a chart, and then basically have the video box zoom out from the tip of the chart, up to you saying it on that date, predicting
[00:51:30.697 --> 00:51:31.037]  I don't know.
[00:51:51.747 --> 00:52:00.833]  Like I said, folks, I never get up on air about a product or something and say, you know, on the economy, you haven't heard me for 12 years, let's just promote gold or silver, because I couldn't find a good company.
[00:52:01.434 --> 00:52:01.734]  Okay?
[00:52:02.615 --> 00:52:05.697]  But now, I'm like, wait, I've known about this guy for a long time, he's been around 25 years.
[00:52:06.117 --> 00:52:12.382]  And so I actually talked to him, became a sponsor, and I'm like, he doesn't brag, but I'm like, wait, I looked you up, you're the biggest silver dealer in the U.S.
[00:52:12.422 --> 00:52:14.163]  Well, yeah, we are, kind of don't brag about it.
[00:52:14.543 --> 00:52:16.545]  But that makes you a target by a lot of folks.
[00:52:16.565 --> 00:52:19.108]  But the point is, that's because they do a great job.
[00:52:19.168 --> 00:52:21.270]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.733]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:52:24.874 --> 00:52:25.454]  Or 720-605-3000.
[00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:29.178]  Dr. Elliott, spend a few more minutes with us in the first five.
[00:52:29.438 --> 00:52:31.560]  And then folks, I'm shifting gears in your phone calls.
[00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:32.962]  More on the DNC.
[00:52:33.142 --> 00:52:34.303]  All the insane news.
[00:52:34.984 --> 00:52:35.804]  It's all coming up.
[00:52:35.844 --> 00:52:36.585]  Hour number two.
[00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:37.086]  Stay with us.
[00:52:47.648 --> 00:52:55.693]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[00:52:56.674 --> 00:53:00.456]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:53:00.896 --> 00:53:03.098]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:03.938 --> 00:53:09.342]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:18.981]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:21.161]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:26.302]  Three of them notified us that, we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in fours.
[00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:29.323]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts.
[00:53:30.283 --> 00:53:35.584]  We found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country, not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:36.405 --> 00:53:37.905]  And they said, listen, you know,
[00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:55.143]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it dropships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:55.523 --> 00:54:02.189]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.563]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:23.265]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:23.365 --> 00:54:29.989]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:30.149 --> 00:54:32.631]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:32.811 --> 00:54:34.732]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:34.932 --> 00:54:44.705]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:45.326 --> 00:54:47.749]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.871]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:50.513 --> 00:54:57.237]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:57.337 --> 00:55:03.000]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:11.645]  So, bought these Ultimate Turmeric Formulums, sold out at InfoWarsTore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:11.685 --> 00:55:13.786]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:55:14.006 --> 00:55:14.106]  And
[00:55:15.376 --> 00:55:28.682]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:29.162 --> 00:55:33.544]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:33.604 --> 00:55:38.166]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:42.169 --> 00:55:44.490]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:45.211]  It's amazing.
[00:55:45.351 --> 00:55:46.271]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:46.331 --> 00:55:48.173]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:08.166 --> 00:56:08.446]  Thank you.
[00:56:37.575 --> 00:56:39.116]  To me it look like a leprechaun to me.
[00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:40.657]  All you gotta do is look up in the tree.
[00:56:40.757 --> 00:56:44.899]  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?
[00:56:44.919 --> 00:56:46.940]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.361]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:48.381 --> 00:56:49.341]  Give me the gold.
[00:56:49.362 --> 00:56:51.062]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:51.082 --> 00:56:52.943]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:53.084 --> 00:56:54.184]  Give me the gold.
[00:56:54.204 --> 00:56:55.885]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.146]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:56:58.166 --> 00:56:59.247]  Give me the gold.
[00:56:59.287 --> 00:57:01.288]  I don't wanna know where to go.
[00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:08.539]  Give me the gold!
[00:57:44.573 --> 00:57:48.895]  Well, I don't know any leprechauns, but I know Dr. Kirk Elliott, and if you're wanting gold, he's the place to get it.
[00:57:48.935 --> 00:57:50.576]  But this is a very nice leprechaun.
[00:57:50.976 --> 00:57:56.179]  He's advising you to get silver at KEPM.com forward slash gold or call 720-605-3900.
[00:57:56.259 --> 00:58:00.422]  Dr. Elliott, we've got four minutes left.
[00:58:00.942 --> 00:58:01.802]  Any other key points?
[00:58:01.822 --> 00:58:04.464]  I know there's a lot of stuff going on you'd like to add about what's happening.
[00:58:06.058 --> 00:58:20.261]  I mean, you've got the inflationary pressures, you've got these wars, you've got these rumors of wars, you've got things escalating in Israel, you've got this perverted circus called the DNC that's happening where people are dressing up like abortion pills.
[00:58:20.301 --> 00:58:22.442]  It's like, what is going on, right?
[00:58:22.522 --> 00:58:26.503]  So to me, these are all connected, even though it seems like they're not.
[00:58:27.023 --> 00:58:31.965]  Because to me, all of these are a physical manifestation of a spiritual battle that's being waged, right?
[00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:35.026]  It's a battle for the soul of America.
[00:58:35.046 --> 00:58:40.367]  It's a battle for the hearts and minds of men and women and children in America, right?
[00:58:40.487 --> 00:58:55.112]  And so when you see this all happening at the same time, whether it's the financial meltdown that you and I talk about a lot with banks, and this is why gold and silver are soaring, when you see that the societal, you know, decadence
[00:58:55.592 --> 00:58:56.972]  I don't know what else to call it.
[00:58:57.032 --> 00:59:00.393]  It's just complete meltdown of everything that's moral happening.
[00:59:00.853 --> 00:59:11.156]  When you've got the wars and the rumors of wars, when you've got this move towards central bank digital currency that you and I have talked about, Alex, all of these are interconnected.
[00:59:11.416 --> 00:59:16.238]  They're connected at the hip, and it's bigger than just the finance.
[00:59:16.418 --> 00:59:18.098]  It's bigger than just banks.
[00:59:18.238 --> 00:59:20.079]  It's bigger than just moral decay.
[00:59:21.281 --> 00:59:24.682]  This is actually the manifestation of a spiritual battle.
[00:59:24.702 --> 00:59:37.285]  So therefore, once you've identified that that's what it is, we can take the pieces that we know that we can actually fix without having a big, large, collective voice like changing politicians' mind.
[00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:38.706]  You have to have a large, collective voice.
[00:59:39.406 --> 00:59:41.787]  Changing your finances is a singular voice.
[00:59:41.987 --> 00:59:42.467]  It's yours.
[00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:47.749]  And sometimes it's that still small voice in your head that says, yep, I know that something's wrong.
[00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:51.310]  My gut, my intuition, it's telling me I've got to do something.
[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:55.112]  And you just make that decision to change.
[00:59:55.192 --> 00:59:55.392]  Right.
[00:59:55.452 --> 00:59:56.912]  So this is where I see us.
[00:59:57.853 --> 00:59:58.553]  It's bigger.
[00:59:59.153 --> 00:59:59.433]  To me,
[01:00:22.816 --> 01:00:29.859]  It's like those Mark Dice videos where he goes out and he offers somebody a full ounce of silver for $1, and they say no.
[01:00:30.019 --> 01:00:33.221]  Or he offers them a full ounce of gold for $1, and they think it's fake.
[01:00:34.221 --> 01:00:40.284]  Even though a coin that looked that good that was fake, but it's real, so it's worth thousands of dollars, the gold, and they won't even give him a dollar.
[01:00:41.178 --> 01:00:43.780]  And he talks to 50 people, and finally one guy goes, yeah, I'll take it.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.342]  He looks at it, yeah, that's worth thousands.
[01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:51.687]  The people perish for lack of knowledge, and it would have been smart to buy gold and silver years ago when it was way down.
[01:00:51.707 --> 01:00:56.491]  Those people have really done well, but there's such movement in it, it's like you're doing that now.
[01:00:57.608 --> 01:00:58.669]  The train has arrived.
[01:00:59.069 --> 01:01:00.070]  The ship has arrived.
[01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.791]  There's no way with inflation going into the future, it's not going to go up.
[01:01:02.872 --> 01:01:04.433]  And all evidence points towards now.
[01:01:04.933 --> 01:01:07.355]  People need to get into silver now.
[01:01:07.755 --> 01:01:10.497]  And like you said, very soon they'll be cashing it in for gold.
[01:01:10.637 --> 01:01:11.797]  Literally free gold.
[01:01:12.098 --> 01:01:15.260]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720605300.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.082]  Call them, tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:24.646]  Dr. Elliott, yeah, send me all your research on where we're going with BRICS and the wars and all.
[01:01:24.706 --> 01:01:25.747]  Let's do a deep dive soon.
[01:01:26.007 --> 01:01:27.568]  And let's have you on and take calls.
[01:01:27.568 --> 01:01:27.808]  False.
[01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.869]  Let's do it.
[01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.829]  Let's do that soon.
[01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.990]  We'll do it sometime this week.
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.810]  Thank you, Dr. Elliott.
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:33.551]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:33.971]  Stay with us.
[01:01:34.471 --> 01:01:37.513]  If you're a TV viewer, we're also on all the radio stations.
[01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:51.159]  There's Joe Biden shuffling off this morning from the crime-ridden city of Chicago with Jill going off to California for a multi-week vacation.
[01:01:51.899 --> 01:01:55.801]  The big question is who's running the country as Joe and Jill shuffle off
[01:01:56.869 --> 01:02:02.773]  To DC, then we'll head up to California for a vacation the rest of the week, and then go off to another vacation.
[01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:05.996]  Who is running the show?
[01:02:06.116 --> 01:02:09.798]  And look, I know as listeners, you know it's a bureaucracy.
[01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:10.559]  It's a deep state.
[01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:23.444]  But we can't just let that in our minds, myself included, because I'm guilty of this, just normalize the fact that, okay, they stole the election and then stole the primaries and installed Joe and then removed him and installed Kamala.
[01:02:23.464 --> 01:02:25.125]  Hell, they may remove her.
[01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:26.967]  Because the sky's the limit.
[01:02:27.087 --> 01:02:28.328]  This isn't normal.
[01:02:29.209 --> 01:02:30.269]  This isn't good.
[01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:34.393]  And when you have mainstream articles last week going, well, it's no big deal.
[01:02:34.853 --> 01:02:36.955]  Thousands of fake headlines and articles a week.
[01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:41.515]  Posted in all the major newspapers that look like the newspaper wrote it.
[01:02:41.535 --> 01:02:50.439]  We know they're already deceitful and lie, but this is the Kamala Harris Deep State campaign writing thousands of fake articles.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.840]  You say, how do they do that?
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.821]  They have AI just on a bunch of topics.
[01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:56.442]  They admit this with no name on who wrote it.
[01:02:56.842 --> 01:03:01.484]  Just spamming BS, BS polls, BS articles, BS policy.
[01:03:02.644 --> 01:03:03.645]  And people just see that.
[01:03:03.665 --> 01:03:05.746]  They just see the headline and think, oh, well, that's happening.
[01:03:06.539 --> 01:03:08.820]  So this is total and complete weaponization.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.821]  Look at this breakdown right here.
[01:03:12.841 --> 01:03:19.323]  84% positive coverage by ABC, CBS, and NBC of Kamala Harris in a study.
[01:03:19.343 --> 01:03:21.043]  89% negative of Trump.
[01:03:22.404 --> 01:03:23.244]  We do have choices.
[01:03:23.264 --> 01:03:24.485]  With Trump, prosperity and peace.
[01:03:25.245 --> 01:03:27.946]  With Kamala Harris, poverty and war.
[01:03:29.466 --> 01:03:32.387]  And now, her fake campaign.
[01:03:32.427 --> 01:03:33.487]  She's only done a few.
[01:03:33.627 --> 01:03:34.308]  Five or six.
[01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:35.448]  One minute.
[01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:44.649]  Quick interviews whenever she will get off an airplane or get off a bus or something.
[01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:53.033]  And it's just crazy, absolutely crazy that this is going on and that she's basically hiding.
[01:03:53.053 --> 01:04:01.976]  And then last night, she comes off onto the stage in a surprise visit, talks about a minute and a half, and then looks drunk and stumbles off.
[01:04:02.136 --> 01:04:08.319]  I mean, this is massive circus maximus, total and complete clown show.
[01:04:09.139 --> 01:04:13.100]  So how do you expect her when she's cognitively not even as good as Biden?
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.201]  Boy, that's saying a lot.
[01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:15.812]  Debate Trump.
[01:04:15.832 --> 01:04:17.553]  So remember the hoax in the last three weeks?
[01:04:18.534 --> 01:04:19.895]  Trump refuses to debate.
[01:04:21.116 --> 01:04:22.438]  No, they sent Trump a letter.
[01:04:22.798 --> 01:04:28.623]  You look at the fine print and said, will you agree to whatever debate, wherever we want, anytime, anyplace, any rules?
[01:04:28.663 --> 01:04:30.525]  He said, no, I will debate you.
[01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:32.667]  Let's discuss the format of the debate.
[01:04:33.227 --> 01:04:35.089]  And then they never send him a format of the debate.
[01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:37.091]  So, or what they're proposing.
[01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.615]  So they run headlines everywhere.
[01:04:39.695 --> 01:04:40.555]  Trump's chicken.
[01:04:40.935 --> 01:04:42.476]  Trump won't debate Kamala.
[01:04:42.976 --> 01:04:46.297]  Meanwhile, Trump's everywhere doing interviews dozens of times a day.
[01:04:46.757 --> 01:04:48.738]  Multiple stump events every other day.
[01:04:48.898 --> 01:04:49.918]  Rallies everywhere.
[01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:53.760]  Going back to the scene where they tried to kill him in Butler soon.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.521]  Showing all this energy, all this stamina.
[01:04:57.801 --> 01:04:59.021]  And they say, he can't talk.
[01:04:59.081 --> 01:04:59.942]  He has no energy.
[01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:01.322]  He wants to quit.
[01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:02.523]  He's scared of Kamala.
[01:05:02.563 --> 01:05:03.323]  He won't debate her.
[01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.633]  And then he says, OK, well, you didn't respond to me with a proposal.
[01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:11.396]  I said I would listen to your proposal.
[01:05:11.416 --> 01:05:12.957]  That's how this works.
[01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:19.844]  Fox News will do a fair mediated debate, which those Fox News debates are actually usually anti-Republican.
[01:05:19.864 --> 01:05:22.447]  They actually would have like, you know, Chris Wallace up there.
[01:05:23.067 --> 01:05:28.473]  And, you know, he would or, you know, famously all those other reporters.
[01:05:29.728 --> 01:05:33.009]  Who's the blonde chick that came and interviewed me when she was at NBC after Fox?
[01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:38.130]  Who's totally controlled and now is trying to clean up her act a little bit.
[01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.191]  Who's the blonde?
[01:05:39.211 --> 01:05:39.711]  Megyn Kelly.
[01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:45.152]  If you go back to those Fox debates, they were skewed against Trump.
[01:05:45.952 --> 01:05:52.354]  So, this would be a very, probably fair, even skewed towards Kamala.
[01:05:53.354 --> 01:05:55.575]  And now she is officially, this morning,
[01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:59.818]  Refused to debate Trump on Fox.
[01:05:59.878 --> 01:06:06.883]  So I would expect her, with only 77, 76 days to the election, to probably never even debate Trump.
[01:06:07.883 --> 01:06:12.266]  I don't know how she gets away with it, but you know, this is the part two of the campaign from the basement.
[01:06:13.987 --> 01:06:19.151]  Comrade Kamala, Trump wrote on ex-Andrew Social, has just informed us that she will not
[01:06:20.199 --> 01:06:22.360]  Do the Fox News debate on September 4th.
[01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:38.749]  I'm not surprised by this development because I feel that she knows it's very difficult at best for her to defend her record, setting flip-flopping on absolutely everything she once believed in, including her statements that there will be no fracking in Pennsylvania and her horrible performance on the border.
[01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:48.395]  Our borders are where millions of criminals and people, where mental health institutions and terrorists have been allowed to pour into our country, totally unchecked and unvetted.
[01:06:49.344 --> 01:06:53.268]  It's called, and she loves it, An Open Border.
[01:06:53.869 --> 01:07:03.859]  Rather than debate on September 4th, I have agreed to do a town hall anchored by Sean Hannity for Fox that will take place in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[01:07:04.179 --> 01:07:05.220]  Details to follow.
[01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:08.083]  So there you go.
[01:07:08.184 --> 01:07:10.266]  Now, thousands of headlines.
[01:07:11.642 --> 01:07:15.024]  Radio programs, TV news productions, podcasts.
[01:07:16.004 --> 01:07:17.925]  Remember it trending two, three weeks ago.
[01:07:18.505 --> 01:07:19.826]  Man, Trump's a chicken.
[01:07:20.747 --> 01:07:22.027]  Man, he won't debate her.
[01:07:22.267 --> 01:07:23.888]  All because they just made it up.
[01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:29.851]  And then now they won't give a proposal.
[01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:30.511]  He gives one.
[01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:31.212]  They go, nope.
[01:07:33.012 --> 01:07:37.114]  And you know, CNN already got the other debate when Trump cleaned the floor with Biden.
[01:07:37.715 --> 01:07:39.035]  So it's fair for Fox to get it.
[01:07:39.796 --> 01:07:40.036]  But again,
[01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:45.667]  Joe Rogan has bigger viewers than the top three or four Fox shows combined.
[01:07:46.588 --> 01:07:49.450]  My show is as big or bigger than any of the top Fox shows.
[01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:50.711]  Tucker's way bigger.
[01:07:52.253 --> 01:07:54.795]  We used to have like 5 million viewers on there and a few million online.
[01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:56.316]  Now his average show is about 30 million.
[01:07:56.336 --> 01:07:58.838]  His bigger show is 200 million, 300 million.
[01:07:59.799 --> 01:08:04.723]  Elon Musk does The Spaces with Trump last Monday, eight, nine days ago.
[01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:05.784]  Gets over a billion viewers.
[01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:18.909]  Why doesn't Elon just, you know, rent a big hotel ballroom and just have an old-fashioned debate with Kamala and Trump for three hours, like the Lincoln-Douglas debates?
[01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:24.233]  Like, that went for like a day or something, but the point is, is that just let him slug it out.
[01:08:24.293 --> 01:08:26.795]  Well, she can't do that, folks.
[01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:36.662]  She has to be given the questions beforehand, she has to practice and be completely scripted, and she'll still come off as smart as a box of rocks.
[01:08:38.086 --> 01:08:39.407]  So that is a big deal.
[01:08:39.827 --> 01:08:41.768]  Meanwhile, they had a slip of the tongue last night.
[01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:42.628]  We'll get that clip ready.
[01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:48.271]  Kamala committed to strengthening illegal immigration.
[01:08:48.311 --> 01:08:53.914]  We got a report on it on Infowars.com by Kellen McBreen.
[01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:58.456]  And last night, that's exactly what Biden said.
[01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:05.360]  Kamala and I are committed to strengthening illegal immigration.
[01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:07.743]  You heard that right.
[01:09:07.803 --> 01:09:09.724]  It's just a few seconds long.
[01:09:09.764 --> 01:09:10.264]  Here it is.
[01:09:12.184 --> 01:09:14.664]  Common Lawyer committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[01:09:15.485 --> 01:09:17.905]  Roll it a few more times.
[01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:22.286]  Common Lawyer committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[01:09:23.646 --> 01:09:26.127]  Common Lawyer committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[01:09:27.467 --> 01:09:29.967]  Common Lawyer committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[01:09:31.308 --> 01:09:33.748]  Common Lawyer committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:36.709]  Should we play that five more times?
[01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:40.550]  I mean, I know it's obnoxious, but that's what we've got going on here.
[01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:43.071]  Here's Representative Joyce
[01:10:05.319 --> 01:10:07.639]  Beattie criticizes J.D.
[01:10:07.699 --> 01:10:12.160]  Vance for making it to the Ivy League school after growing up poor in Ohio.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:19.581]  So, again, around 95% of corporate donations go to Kamala and to Biden before.
[01:10:19.601 --> 01:10:20.262]  You can look it up.
[01:10:20.442 --> 01:10:21.482]  Usually it's 60-40.
[01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:25.983]  But the richest people, you can look it up, the richest people in Congress are Democrats.
[01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:29.683]  Most billionaires are Democrats, almost all of them here in the U.S.
[01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:34.144]  Almost all their contributions go against Trump.
[01:10:35.154 --> 01:10:37.795]  And the Democrats are flying around in private jets.
[01:10:38.115 --> 01:10:39.135]  They're insider trading.
[01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:39.875]  They're doing all this.
[01:10:40.475 --> 01:10:43.436]  And then they talk about how they're populist last night.
[01:10:44.076 --> 01:10:46.937]  That was their main message and how anybody making money is bad.
[01:10:49.477 --> 01:10:53.818]  But never a big discussion about how the globals created inflation to transfer their wealth.
[01:10:54.899 --> 01:10:56.719]  So here she is attacking J.D.
[01:10:56.739 --> 01:10:58.119]  Vance.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.820]  Now J.D.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.441]  Vance likes to talk about how he's from Ohio.
[01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:11.449]  But as soon as he could, he ran away to Yale and Silicon Valley.
[01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:18.417]  Cozying up with billionaires while trashing our communities.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.383]  Now I want to play you something that Darren McBreen put together.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.802]  And we titled this last night on X and posted it, and it needs to be shared.
[01:11:28.562 --> 01:11:29.202]  It has been shared.
[01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:31.463]  It's got a half million views, but I think it should get about 10 million views.
[01:11:32.164 --> 01:11:32.904]  This is breaking.
[01:11:32.944 --> 01:11:37.886]  Kamala Harris releases powerful new presidential ad celebrating Democrat cities.
[01:11:37.906 --> 01:11:38.306]  Here it is.
[01:11:39.787 --> 01:11:41.808]  This is our town.
[01:11:41.828 --> 01:11:47.691]  We've got steel in our spines, iron in our veins, and hope in our hearts.
[01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:54.990]  We've got the flavor, the guts, the grit, and those big shoulders you've heard so much about.
[01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.051]  We're Bold City.
[01:11:57.391 --> 01:11:58.391]  A proud city.
[01:11:58.971 --> 01:12:01.072]  A who you callin' second city?
[01:12:01.572 --> 01:12:03.812]  Where 77 neighborhoods are one.
[01:12:04.512 --> 01:12:05.513]  A city of giants.
[01:12:06.053 --> 01:12:07.213]  A city with heart.
[01:12:07.853 --> 01:12:09.033]  A city with heroes.
[01:12:09.653 --> 01:12:11.814]  A sweet, sweet place to call home.
[01:12:12.894 --> 01:12:13.874]  We were born ready.
[01:12:14.494 --> 01:12:15.795]  Baptized by fire.
[01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:16.955]  Tireless.
[01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.015]  Tenacious.
[01:12:18.415 --> 01:12:18.935]  Tested.
[01:12:19.475 --> 01:12:20.035]  Trusted.
[01:12:20.976 --> 01:12:24.576]  And like someone else we know, when we fight, we win.
[01:12:25.536 --> 01:12:27.737]  We're ready to rise to the challenge.
[01:12:27.797 --> 01:12:29.077]  To rise to new heights.
[01:12:29.617 --> 01:12:32.178]  Rise, rise, rise.
[01:12:32.638 --> 01:12:34.278]  Up, up, and away we go.
[01:12:34.798 --> 01:12:39.519]  Hey, make some noise so we can hear you, America!
[01:12:41.744 --> 01:12:43.571]  Welcome to Chicago!
[01:12:55.282 --> 01:12:58.443]  What's that swinging between Big Mike's legs?
[01:12:58.903 --> 01:13:02.044]  The same thing that gave Fauci AIDS.
[01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:04.565]  An Anaconda, Burrock's favorite pet.
[01:13:05.305 --> 01:13:08.066]  Gets him higher than a turbojet, yeah!
[01:13:08.766 --> 01:13:11.507]  Joan Rivers said it's true.
[01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.108]  Under the dress, it's become unglued.
[01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:18.129]  Put it back on now, Big Mike's gonna let it show.
[01:13:31.354 --> 01:13:31.674]  All right.
[01:13:31.734 --> 01:13:35.598]  I want to turn on the phone system and open the phones up.
[01:13:35.698 --> 01:13:37.500]  And four callers got left on hold yesterday.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.361]  They gave us their name and number.
[01:13:38.401 --> 01:13:39.862]  We'll call them back, put them up ahead of the line.
[01:13:40.522 --> 01:13:44.726]  You're welcome to talk about any subject you want for the balance of the hour ahead of these huge guests coming on.
[01:13:44.746 --> 01:13:48.790]  But let's just get eight callers or so on the board because I don't want to leave anybody holding.
[01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:51.793]  You're welcome to talk about any issue you want.
[01:13:52.233 --> 01:13:53.655]  The ridiculous behavior last night.
[01:13:54.465 --> 01:13:58.066]  Whatever you'd like to discuss, it's open phones, first-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:13:58.446 --> 01:13:59.467]  You agree, you disagree.
[01:13:59.507 --> 01:14:00.487]  If you disagree, it's fine.
[01:14:00.507 --> 01:14:01.627]  I just want to play games with you.
[01:14:02.528 --> 01:14:05.809]  And, you know, sit there and have you play little mind games once you get on with me.
[01:14:05.829 --> 01:14:07.649]  I'm not trying to get in a fight with me personally.
[01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:08.649]  I'm not going to play games with you.
[01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.610]  Got issues you want to debate?
[01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.770]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:13.651]  Toll-free number 877-789-2539.
[01:14:13.671 --> 01:14:13.811]  877-789-Alex.
[01:14:13.831 --> 01:14:13.871]  877-789-2539.
[01:14:23.354 --> 01:14:30.578]  Okay, I just want to show you articles here from around the world to give you a little snapshot of some of the good and bad things that are happening.
[01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:45.965]  But to just point out again that whether you are in Canada or whether you're in Europe or whether you're in Australia, if you're in the Western world, it's the same globalist policies, top to bottom, run by the big central banks with BlackRock as the enforcer.
[01:14:47.062 --> 01:14:54.763]  And we just want to identify who the ruling class really is, that they're anti-free market, they're anti-human, they're transhumanist, they're anti-family, they're anti-God.
[01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:55.904]  They want to be God.
[01:14:57.084 --> 01:15:00.845]  And this is a really important area in all of that.
[01:15:00.865 --> 01:15:04.405]  This is a big report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:06.646 --> 01:15:07.086]  Report.
[01:15:09.206 --> 01:15:12.647]  Biden administration, Russia's digital ID plans.
[01:15:16.997 --> 01:15:27.221]  And when you read into this, we already have IDs, we already have a national ID card, but now he wants to unify it with these global databases.
[01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:31.523]  He wants to give them to illegal aliens, which most cities are already doing through the driver's license area.
[01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:36.005]  But this will be federally issued so they can just bypass all of that.
[01:15:37.145 --> 01:15:41.809]  And then give them benefits, everything else that they've been doing and that they're calling for expanding.
[01:15:41.849 --> 01:15:46.133]  And the co-chair of the campaign, Governor Whitmer of Michigan, says, oh, everybody loves it.
[01:15:46.413 --> 01:15:47.634]  We have a consensus.
[01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:55.721]  People resonate with free health care and free housing and free education and free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free.
[01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:58.911]  Even though citizens and veterans don't get that.
[01:15:59.672 --> 01:16:07.218]  The Biden administration is working to expedite widespread adoption of digital IDs including driver's license and draft executive order indicates.
[01:16:07.859 --> 01:16:22.351]  Digital IDs are a contentious concept primarily because of the concentration of eventually the entirety of people's sensitive private information and centralized databases controlled by the government and on people's phones.
[01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:34.812]  But you see, that's a unified ledger so they can implement the social contract on you and control what you do and punish you if you don't submit.
[01:16:34.872 --> 01:16:35.972]  So it's an important article.
[01:16:36.753 --> 01:16:37.613]  You should go read it.
[01:16:37.673 --> 01:16:45.157]  It's being set up via Bill Gates and a UN program for a world unified standardized program.
[01:16:45.457 --> 01:16:48.618]  And what have they done in Canada with the truckers that were peaceful?
[01:16:48.718 --> 01:16:51.760]  They have big trials of them going on right now for long prison sentences.
[01:16:55.188 --> 01:16:57.329]  And they have terms like concealing rebellion.
[01:16:57.489 --> 01:17:01.731]  You didn't actually rebel even violently, but you meant it to be rebellion.
[01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:02.791]  They define it.
[01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:14.677]  Or, over in the UK, well, the law says you have free speech, except if we say it could incite somebody, and then they define that, and then saying the majority of rapes are the illegal aliens, boom, 22 months in prison.
[01:17:15.877 --> 01:17:17.278]  I played the judge last week saying that.
[01:17:17.558 --> 01:17:23.981]  You said that many of the migrants are raping, of course it's true, 22 months in prison.
[01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:32.106]  So, UK woman arrested for silent prayer wins payout and an apology.
[01:17:32.126 --> 01:17:33.166]  Remember that clip last year?
[01:17:33.766 --> 01:17:38.908]  This happened to a bunch of people just praying about 7,500 yards away from the front of an abortuary.
[01:17:40.049 --> 01:17:40.509]  Silently.
[01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:42.549]  And they came and arrested her.
[01:17:42.569 --> 01:17:43.530]  They said that is offensive.
[01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:51.413]  German court reverses ban on right-wing magazines censored by left German government.
[01:17:51.453 --> 01:17:54.194]  So there's major pushback and a lot of good things happening.
[01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:58.352]  UK to release 5,000 violent prisoners.
[01:17:58.392 --> 01:17:59.032]  It's in the article.
[01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:05.475]  One guy, you know, a black guy killed, an illegal alien killed a kid, a migrant killed a kid.
[01:18:05.495 --> 01:18:06.776]  It was okay because he was white.
[01:18:07.256 --> 01:18:08.577]  He got six months in jail.
[01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:13.219]  They let him out and they're putting people in there again for years for their speech.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.180]  It's not violent.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:20.343]  So UK to release 5,000 prisoners to make room for nationalists labeled far-right by government.
[01:18:20.383 --> 01:18:23.705]  Now they're going to label misogynists as terrorists and lock them up.
[01:18:26.047 --> 01:18:33.251]  Ukrainian MPs, and hell, Zelensky actually just signed this today, paved the way for banning largest Christian church.
[01:18:33.311 --> 01:18:46.338]  So, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that founded Russia 1,000 years ago, over 1,000 years ago now, a little over 1,000, has officially been banned, and that's exactly what the globalists want to be able to do here.
[01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:58.620]  Italian state media reporter apologizes over Nazi SS broadcast where they interview soldiers from the Azov battalion wearing swastikas and other Nazi paraphernalia.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:13.688]  And then, of course, here's Kir Stalin, the Prime Minister of the UK, from a few years ago saying, lock up anybody, use the military that criticizes lockdowns or shots, put them in prison.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:19.083]  And I forgot to send you guys this clip, but I want to play it so you... Oh, we actually have it.
[01:19:19.123 --> 01:19:19.904]  Wow, I didn't see it on the list.
[01:19:19.924 --> 01:19:20.425]  Maybe I missed it.
[01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:22.306]  So this is him a few years ago.
[01:19:22.326 --> 01:19:23.147]  He's now the Prime Minister.
[01:19:23.227 --> 01:19:23.948]  And you're hearing this.
[01:19:24.528 --> 01:19:25.509]  Australia's saying it.
[01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:26.850]  Canada's saying it.
[01:19:27.431 --> 01:19:31.174]  You see all these different WHO people saying it, including Peter Hotez here in the U.S.
[01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:32.635]  They mean business.
[01:19:32.655 --> 01:19:34.577]  We have the head of the global U.N.
[01:19:34.657 --> 01:19:37.539]  emergency management system saying it, Dr. Ryan.
[01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:41.483]  Here's the Prime Minister, here's Stalin.
[01:19:42.981 --> 01:19:46.844]  We have to deal with the anti-vax campaigns because they will cost lives.
[01:19:47.405 --> 01:19:52.189]  And if we need to pass emergency legislation to deal with them, I'd be quite prepared to work with the government on that.
[01:19:52.449 --> 01:19:54.471]  We could pass it in a couple of days in Parliament.
[01:19:54.871 --> 01:19:57.453]  And the sooner we do that, frankly, the better.
[01:19:58.314 --> 01:20:00.976]  For many NHS staff, it is really distressing.
[01:20:01.357 --> 01:20:06.741]  They're under huge pressure, and it's been building over the last few weeks and months.
[01:20:07.021 --> 01:20:08.442]  They're all doing their level best.
[01:20:08.582 --> 01:20:12.145]  They're all seeing that it's getting very, very difficult.
[01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:18.130]  And to come out and to have to confront that, or even hear that, is against the national interest.
[01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:21.412]  And if we need legislation, I'll sit down with Boris Johnson.
[01:20:21.632 --> 01:20:27.337]  We can draft it, we can pass it very, very quickly, because that misinformation will cost lives.
[01:20:27.637 --> 01:20:30.099]  We need as many people vaccinated as possible.
[01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:35.564]  We all need to give people confidence to be vaccinated as part of the program.
[01:20:35.624 --> 01:20:37.906]  And it's also dealing with this misinformation.
[01:20:39.047 --> 01:20:42.790]  Which they define as misinformation, even though everything we said was proven true, everything they said was a lie.
[01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:49.755]  Where the virus came from, blocking the treatments, giving people poison treatments, giving them the mRNA shots that have killed over 35 million people.
[01:20:50.716 --> 01:20:52.598]  But you've all seen those compilation videos.
[01:20:54.002 --> 01:20:58.405]  Where they'll all say the same thing about Biden or Obama or the globalism or COVID.
[01:20:59.165 --> 01:21:00.326]  Well, you can do the same thing with him.
[01:21:00.386 --> 01:21:07.890]  You can take German, Dutch, French, Scottish, Irish, UK, Canadian, U.S.
[01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:08.570]  politicians.
[01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:12.793]  You know, where they're all saying we got to build back better and the Great Reset.
[01:21:13.733 --> 01:21:15.014]  And show them all say the same thing.
[01:21:15.274 --> 01:21:16.155]  I played it last hour.
[01:21:17.035 --> 01:21:19.757]  Peter Hotez, who's the spokesman for the WHO.
[01:21:21.538 --> 01:21:23.019]  Little mini-me of Fauci.
[01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.107]  Saying we've got to use the military and police.
[01:21:27.127 --> 01:21:31.328]  We've got to outlaw questioning our science because you're going to kill people.
[01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.228]  Now look at this article.
[01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:38.669]  Freedom convoy trial, remember that a few years ago in Canada, resumes.
[01:21:38.749 --> 01:21:41.310]  Leaders still face possible 10-year jail sentence.
[01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:42.890]  Ottawa, LiveSite News.
[01:21:43.851 --> 01:21:48.852]  After a five-month hiatus, the trial for two Freedom Convoy
[01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:56.116]  Leaders resumed in an Ottawa courthouse last week for closing arguments.
[01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:16.432]  Justice Heather Perkins McVeigh, who is overseeing the trial, adjourned the court proceedings in March to allow the government to prepare legal arguments to block its claims that leaders Chris Barber and Tamara Leach, who we've had on, co-conspirators, as well as to give the defendants time to prepare the case that the two are innocent.
[01:22:17.577 --> 01:22:22.786]  Leash and Barber face multiple charges for the 2022 protests, including mischief.
[01:22:23.628 --> 01:22:25.711]  Concealing mischief.
[01:22:25.751 --> 01:22:26.593]  Can't prove any mischief.
[01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:28.596]  They're just saying we're going to protest peacefully.
[01:22:28.616 --> 01:22:29.538]  We're sick of being locked down.
[01:22:30.734 --> 01:22:38.478]  Concealing intimidation and obstructing police for taking part in the organizing an anti-mandate freedom convoy in Canada.
[01:22:38.578 --> 01:22:42.120]  Anyone charged with mischief could face potential jail sentence of 10 years.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.562]  Remember, they grabbed their bank accounts of thousands of people.
[01:22:45.062 --> 01:22:47.923]  They used geolocating and geofencing illegally to do it.
[01:22:49.384 --> 01:22:51.265]  Because Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator.
[01:22:51.285 --> 01:22:52.406]  He loves dictatorship.
[01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:53.146]  Want to see the clip again?
[01:22:53.567 --> 01:22:55.107]  Nah, you've seen it 500 times.
[01:22:55.928 --> 01:22:57.769]  So, they're telling you what they're doing.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.440]  They want to put us all in jail, whether you're in the U.S.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.461]  or Canada or Germany.
[01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:04.201]  They are totalitarians.
[01:23:04.241 --> 01:23:05.101]  They are authoritarians.
[01:23:05.141 --> 01:23:07.642]  They are the baddies, the bad guys.
[01:23:10.122 --> 01:23:26.226]  The court sat for three days last week, from August 13th to 15th, and thus far the government has asserted that the absence of violence or peaceful nature of the protest didn't make it lawful, emphasizing that the onus was on the Crown to prove the protest unlawfulness.
[01:23:27.245 --> 01:23:35.191]  As reported by LifeSite News at the time, despite the non-violent nature of the protest and the charges, Leach was jailed for weeks before she was granted bail.
[01:23:36.952 --> 01:23:53.725]  The Democracy Fund, TDF, which does crowdfunding for Leach's legal costs, noted in a legal update for the 39-day trial that is expected, the Crown would try to prove the leaders were co-conspirators, meaning the accusations placed against one leader automatically apply to the other.
[01:23:54.892 --> 01:23:56.353]  That's tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:56.373 --> 01:23:59.576]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:23:59.596 --> 01:24:02.438]  And then we've got huge guests on.
[01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:06.021]  I mean, the last interview with one of these guys blew up.
[01:24:06.061 --> 01:24:06.842]  It's really important.
[01:24:07.702 --> 01:24:08.743]  So you want to stay with us?
[01:24:09.524 --> 01:24:10.224]  Follow me on XREL.
[01:24:10.244 --> 01:24:10.725]  Alex Jones.
[01:24:10.825 --> 01:24:11.325]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:12.246 --> 01:24:13.107]  Nitric Boost.
[01:24:14.047 --> 01:24:14.548]  Turmeric 95.
[01:24:16.767 --> 01:24:19.669]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:25.634]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:33.280]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:35.822]  They let us private label their products.
[01:24:35.842 --> 01:24:36.723]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:24:38.945 --> 01:24:41.708]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:24:41.949 --> 01:24:43.270]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:46.555]  And so it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:24:47.295 --> 01:24:47.916]  That's the name.
[01:24:48.177 --> 01:24:53.864]  So we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[01:24:54.324 --> 01:24:57.086]  Well, now that Biden did what he was supposed to and fell on his sword last night,
[01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:26.818]  Pelosi has come out even more intensely than she did two weeks ago when she admitted she removed him with the rest of the deep state.
[01:25:26.858 --> 01:25:29.319]  She now told CNN, I did what I had to do.
[01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:34.481]  Pelosi admits to major role in ousting Biden from the Democratic ticket.
[01:25:36.202 --> 01:25:37.203]  That and more is coming up.
[01:25:37.263 --> 01:25:38.803]  I want to go right to your phone calls now.
[01:25:39.884 --> 01:25:45.687]  But the guest we have coming up in the second hour, we had one of them
[01:25:47.182 --> 01:26:06.091]  Gregory Stenstrom, military officer, great background, really highly recommended by Roger Stone in the Trump campaign, did a great job exposing who's really running the globalist secret societies and basically how this syndicate operates.
[01:26:08.157 --> 01:26:13.539]  And then we're also going to have Colonel Timothy Schindler on with him as well to get to go deeper into this.
[01:26:13.599 --> 01:26:20.921]  But here's just the post on X that got 1.6 million views from the last interview, then broken up pieces of it got tens of millions.
[01:26:21.742 --> 01:26:22.102]  Breaking!
[01:26:22.142 --> 01:26:29.284]  Naval officer publishes powerful dossier exposing the leaders of the deep state meet the council, that's what it's called, running America.
[01:26:29.844 --> 01:26:37.567]  So the deeper dive with Colonel Timothy Schindler and Gregory Stenstrom coming up in the next hour.
[01:26:39.042 --> 01:26:46.327]  But now, let's do what I said I would do, and let's go to your phone calls in the order they're received.
[01:26:47.007 --> 01:26:51.010]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada on the question of who's running the country.
[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:53.232]  They admit they won't say who it is.
[01:26:53.312 --> 01:26:55.473]  Who's running the country, Carlos?
[01:26:56.794 --> 01:27:07.221]  Well, Alex, I draw your attention to two important data pieces of news that were actually published, but that have received very little attention.
[01:27:08.007 --> 01:27:16.033]  One which a report by O'Keefe Media about a gentleman by the name of Tyler Robinson.
[01:27:16.654 --> 01:27:32.325]  Now, Tyler Robinson is special advisor to the chief of staff of the administration, SB administration, and he's reporting on Jeff Zients, who is the Biden's chief of staff.
[01:27:33.066 --> 01:27:37.249]  And according to the interview that was captured
[01:27:37.964 --> 01:27:38.965]  We're good to go.
[01:28:04.338 --> 01:28:06.619]  Let me explain who Jeffrey Science is.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:31.694]  Jeffrey Science is a World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, five-year-trained young global leader, an Israeli-American agent infiltrated long ago, and he is in fact advising the President of the United States, and according to the interview, he says that Biden's Chief of Staff, Jeff Science, says Robinson, is
[01:28:32.256 --> 01:28:34.860]  The second most powerful person in Washington.
[01:28:36.062 --> 01:28:40.127]  He says whatever this guy says, it's what the president says.
[01:28:40.568 --> 01:28:43.813]  That's on record from James O'Keefe Media.
[01:28:44.588 --> 01:28:46.750]  Yes, I did see that report, and we'll actually pull that up.
[01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:51.175]  Yeah, there's no doubt that Israel has heavily infiltrated the U.S.
[01:28:51.215 --> 01:28:51.595]  government.
[01:28:52.556 --> 01:29:02.266]  I would say that the same extent as the Communist Chinese, and then you've kind of got the Council on Foreign Relations set up by British intelligence in 1921, that is kind of the control arm
[01:29:07.366 --> 01:29:09.788]  The second point I wanted to bring to your attention is that on July 21st,
[01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:42.670]  President Biden passed a baton saying he will not run for re-election.
[01:29:43.390 --> 01:30:00.436]  On the 22nd, he issued a memorandum to the Secretary of State of the Treasury, and he says, by authority, I'm not going to read the numbers because it's not my expertise, but he says, by the authority vested in me,
[01:30:01.498 --> 01:30:12.864]  As President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Section 301 of Title III under United States Code, I hereby order as follows.
[01:30:14.285 --> 01:30:30.673]  Section 1, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, the functions and authorities vested in the President by sections under the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunities
[01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:48.129]  For Ukrainians Act, Division 7 of Public Law, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the functions and authorities vested in the President by Sections blah blah and of the Act.
[01:30:49.049 --> 01:30:58.532]  Section 2 says the delegation of this memorandum shall apply to any provisions of any future public laws that are the same or substantially the same
[01:30:59.019 --> 01:30:59.319]  I'm good.
[01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:31.057]  That means that everything that's been passed under this act is now delegated to Janet Yellen.
[01:31:32.038 --> 01:31:39.647]  Well, as you know, she was in charge of the Federal Reserve, becomes now the Secretary of the Treasury, long infiltrated American Israeli agent,
[01:31:40.111 --> 01:31:47.916]  And at the same time, she's serving the interests not only of the United States, but in this case, of the people of the United States, of course.
[01:31:48.516 --> 01:31:50.498]  In closing, I could talk to you for an hour, Carlos.
[01:31:50.518 --> 01:31:52.079]  I've been calling him for 15, 20 years.
[01:31:53.099 --> 01:32:00.224]  But just in closing, what do we do about this and what do you expect these different bureaucracies and deep state arms to do against Trump?
[01:32:02.754 --> 01:32:08.719]  Alex, for a long, long time, the American people have tolerated the presence of secret societies among them.
[01:32:08.859 --> 01:32:22.251]  And I cannot think in history, being really kind to whatever benevolent functions have been served, I have not found one secret society that has ever been to the interest of the American people.
[01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:23.652]  Not a single one.
[01:32:23.672 --> 01:32:27.115]  In fact, they almost always establish tyrannies and grow like a cancer.
[01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:29.883]  Yes, and why?
[01:32:30.364 --> 01:32:33.544]  Why be secret if you really mean to be benevolent?
[01:32:34.024 --> 01:32:34.925]  That's the whole point.
[01:32:35.365 --> 01:32:47.087]  And as long as this continues, the United States is so badly infiltrated that at this stage you cannot rely on none of your questioning, really, who's really running the country, obviously, because these are outlaws.
[01:32:47.427 --> 01:32:53.989]  These are not people that are, you know, under your authority as the people of America, under the Republic, to do what they must do.
[01:32:58.997 --> 01:33:00.378]  Absolutely.
[01:33:00.858 --> 01:33:01.358]  Absolutely.
[01:33:01.378 --> 01:33:04.260]  And the Israeli lobby has a lot of control over the media as well.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.881]  Thank you so much, Carlos.
[01:33:06.001 --> 01:33:06.642]  Excellent point.
[01:33:06.662 --> 01:33:10.924]  We asked the question earlier, who's really in control right out of the Biden administration, and he just nailed it.
[01:33:11.384 --> 01:33:13.866]  I've talked to a lot of top people and done my own research.
[01:33:13.906 --> 01:33:17.328]  The names he listed definitely have great control.
[01:33:17.368 --> 01:33:18.589]  This is extremely dangerous.
[01:33:18.929 --> 01:33:22.191]  Kamala, she's another empty suit that could be puppeteered.
[01:33:22.651 --> 01:33:23.172]  Thank you, sir.
[01:33:23.972 --> 01:33:27.134]  Miss Lou in Florida, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:33:28.075 --> 01:33:32.718]  Hey Alex, I had something disturbing on X the other day.
[01:33:32.738 --> 01:33:42.244]  This ad was posted on August 1st by the FBI and it is protecting our communities together report hate crime.
[01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:45.946]  They give you an 800 number and a tip line.
[01:33:46.792 --> 01:33:50.674]  Hate crimes not only harm victims but also strike fear into their communities.
[01:33:51.074 --> 01:33:56.356]  The FBI is committed to combating hate crimes and seeking justice for victims.
[01:33:56.856 --> 01:34:00.138]  If you're a victim of or witness to a hate crime,
[01:34:00.805 --> 01:34:02.546]  And then they tell you how to follow through.
[01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:03.506]  I've seen those ads.
[01:34:03.646 --> 01:34:06.147]  Let's talk about, I want you to be able to finish, but let's talk about what they're doing here.
[01:34:06.748 --> 01:34:20.674]  They cut police to respond to real violent crime, theft, robbery, rape, you name it, huge human trafficking, fentanyl, and then all over the Western world, increased funding, like in the UK and here now, for hate crime, drumming that up and throwing the book at people.
[01:34:20.694 --> 01:34:23.335]  And there's the FBI ad you're talking about on screen.
[01:34:23.355 --> 01:34:23.675]  Go ahead.
[01:34:24.836 --> 01:34:27.977]  Well, what I want to say about this, I think their ultimate goal, and I know you know this,
[01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:29.131]  We're good to go.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:34:59.781]  You know, the whole crew.
[01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:05.045]  But there was one on there that I was kind of surprised, and that was William Barr.
[01:35:06.346 --> 01:35:15.513]  Oh yeah, William Barr has been Attorney General twice, he worked for the CIA, basically ran or ran contra during the Reagan administration, and he's a bad guy.
[01:35:16.454 --> 01:35:19.376]  But I didn't realize he was a current player.
[01:35:20.532 --> 01:35:21.532]  Oh, he's high up in it.
[01:35:21.772 --> 01:35:24.733]  He's definitely on the deep state.
[01:35:24.813 --> 01:35:29.534]  He's definitely part of the system that runs things.
[01:35:30.635 --> 01:35:30.975]  Got it.
[01:35:30.995 --> 01:35:33.055]  Well, listen, thank you so much for all you do, Alex.
[01:35:33.135 --> 01:35:35.576]  And listen, I'm a show fan, but I'm also a product fan.
[01:35:36.216 --> 01:35:39.657]  I just got my Dr. Jones natural disorder, and I'm happy.
[01:35:40.472 --> 01:35:41.835]  Well, we wouldn't be here without you.

[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.284]  Well, that was two incredible callers in a row.
[01:35:46.304 --> 01:35:48.769]  I could talk to her for hours, but we won't get to everybody else that we do.
[01:35:48.789 --> 01:35:51.334]  But let me just do a quick plug since she mentioned it.

[01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:10.178]  All right!
[01:38:11.343 --> 01:38:12.324]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:38:12.364 --> 01:38:13.024]  Thanks for holding.
[01:38:13.084 --> 01:38:14.925]  Jefferson from Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:38:16.826 --> 01:38:18.627]  Alex Emmerich Jones, good to talk to you.
[01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:19.447]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[01:38:20.488 --> 01:38:27.532]  You know, it's ironic that your middle name is Emmerich, because the man that wrote the definition of a natural-born citizen was a man named Emmerich Vettel.
[01:38:28.532 --> 01:38:37.517]  And he told the framers and the founders that to be a natural-born citizen, you had to be born in the country of parents, plural, that were citizens of that country.
[01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:41.489]  And nothing's ever changed that since the beginning of our Republic.
[01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:46.974]  But everybody thinks the 14th Amendment changed the definition of what a natural born citizen is.
[01:38:47.754 --> 01:38:52.118]  And we have to revert back to Mr. Vettel to understand that
[01:38:52.714 --> 01:38:53.915]  No, you're right.
[01:38:53.935 --> 01:38:54.615]  You're absolutely right.
[01:38:54.635 --> 01:38:58.117]  And they're trying to run people that are illegitimate on purpose to set that precedent.
[01:38:58.137 --> 01:38:59.138]  People that don't know why.
[01:38:59.338 --> 01:39:01.119]  When our country was founded, they wrote the Constitution.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:33.764]  That you had to have your parents here and you natural born was because Europe had a lot of royalty and they wanted to export their princelings to other countries and install them even in elected systems by backing them with money.
[01:39:34.245 --> 01:39:38.866]  So to stop foreign colonization of political elites, that's why that's in the Constitution.
[01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:48.930]  Right, they would have had to come here and then have babies as they had naturalized as citizens for that to have worked, if we understood the proper definition of natural-born citizen.
[01:39:49.311 --> 01:39:57.053]  So the requirement that you be born inside our country didn't make a lot of sense, because that almost invited them to come over here and have babies here.
[01:39:57.493 --> 01:40:05.395]  But if they were required to be naturalized first, then we would catch on to what they were trying to do before they were successful in having their children over here.
[01:40:05.615 --> 01:40:08.342]  Yes, and so they had to show their loyalty by being naturalized.
[01:40:08.703 --> 01:40:10.808]  And so, bottom line, Kamala Harris is illegitimate.
[01:40:12.415 --> 01:40:18.178]  Right, but that means the rest of the administration is all in violation of their oath to the Constitution to uphold the Constitution.
[01:40:18.218 --> 01:40:21.420]  So they're all on the hook if we can just make the case before the Supreme Court.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.103]  Spenstrom is telling us that the only people that are outside the council are the Supreme Court justices.
[01:40:27.523 --> 01:40:29.324]  So we need to petition them.
[01:40:29.664 --> 01:40:35.787]  That's why we need to talk to Ken Paxton and get him, because he would have standing to bring a case against Kamala Harris.
[01:40:36.087 --> 01:40:43.044]  Before the Supreme Court, which could basically harpoon this whole great whale that is this administration and take it down.
[01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:46.818]  Well, I totally back what you're saying.
[01:40:46.898 --> 01:40:52.802]  And look, the way she didn't get one vote, the way they removed Biden, had a fake letter, drugged him up.
[01:40:52.962 --> 01:40:54.042]  That's all illegitimate.
[01:40:54.103 --> 01:40:57.745]  We are living under a globalist coup, as Naomi Wolf said last week.
[01:40:57.965 --> 01:40:59.086]  Ken Paxson should get on it.
[01:40:59.566 --> 01:41:00.486]  Superlative call.
[01:41:00.566 --> 01:41:00.847]  Wow.
[01:41:01.087 --> 01:41:01.987]  Best calls ever today.
[01:41:02.307 --> 01:41:03.068]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:03.768 --> 01:41:04.929]  Brendan in Florida.
[01:41:04.949 --> 01:41:06.030]  You're on The Year Worldwide.
[01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.430]  Go ahead.
[01:41:07.891 --> 01:41:08.511]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:08.891 --> 01:41:11.333]  First of all, disabled veteran here in Florida.
[01:41:12.328 --> 01:41:15.130]  Uh, have benefited greatly from your products.
[01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:17.892]  Uh, so infowarestore.com.
[01:41:17.912 --> 01:41:18.232]  Thank you.
[01:41:18.412 --> 01:41:20.553]  And, uh, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:41:20.733 --> 01:41:21.274]  Absolutely.
[01:41:22.074 --> 01:41:26.257]  Uh, all the other veterans already know the deal, and the new ones, figure it out.
[01:41:26.297 --> 01:41:27.137]  That's where you gotta go.
[01:41:27.197 --> 01:41:28.618]  Get your products, get healthy.
[01:41:29.479 --> 01:41:30.339]  I'm right behind you.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:37.043]  Alex, I'll be 50 in January, so, uh, veterans gotta come out of retirement for World War III, I guess.
[01:41:38.064 --> 01:41:38.824]  It's crazy, brother.
[01:41:38.844 --> 01:41:39.985]  What do you think about the election coming up?
[01:41:41.898 --> 01:41:45.620]  Well, I think it's largely man versus himself 2024.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.941]  Because it really is.
[01:41:49.521 --> 01:41:56.184]  It's a spiritual battle within each one of us as well as at the macro level, the micro and the macro and everything in between.
[01:41:56.284 --> 01:42:00.946]  So we all have to, like you say, dig deep and.
[01:42:01.207 --> 01:42:05.408]  And then find it and move in the right direction for the children.
[01:42:05.729 --> 01:42:06.849]  It's it's the only way.
[01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:08.230]  I mean, it just can't.
[01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:09.470]  It can't go down.
[01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:11.171]  The stakes could not be higher.
[01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:13.200]  Absolutely.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:26.031]  God bless you, Alex, and I'm a combat veteran, a dual citizen, but I love America, and my family's from Ireland, and please go to hold the line and order your Liberty Coins.
[01:42:26.775 --> 01:42:27.896]  We've got to hold it, guys.
[01:42:28.296 --> 01:42:28.997]  This is it.
[01:42:29.077 --> 01:42:30.798]  If it dies here, it's dead everywhere.
[01:42:30.998 --> 01:42:31.779]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:42:31.919 --> 01:42:32.499]  Absolutely.
[01:42:32.519 --> 01:42:33.800]  This is how to be real Americans.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:34.501]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:36.502]  I hate to get up here and beg all the time for support.
[01:42:36.542 --> 01:42:37.603]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:42:37.643 --> 01:42:39.484]  The enemy's come fully against us, as you've seen.
[01:42:39.505 --> 01:42:41.306]  If they can get us, they can get anybody.
[01:42:41.446 --> 01:42:42.707]  They're trying to get through me to get to you.
[01:42:42.807 --> 01:42:43.608]  It really is happening.
[01:42:43.628 --> 01:42:44.048]  You know that.
[01:42:44.448 --> 01:42:46.430]  It's not like we're not delivering, reaching tens of millions a day.
[01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:50.413]  So I'm very thankful, very humble, and I'm just telling you, thank you, callers, for what you're saying.
[01:42:51.193 --> 01:42:54.594]  Let's go to Jack in Wisconsin, then Anonymous in Washington, D.C.
[01:42:54.994 --> 01:42:56.475]  Jack in Wisconsin, thanks for calling.
[01:42:56.495 --> 01:42:56.835]  Go ahead.
[01:42:58.856 --> 01:42:59.696]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:42:59.736 --> 01:43:15.181]  You were talking about the other day, flooding the zone and training the AI, and I think that's one of the biggest processes that we have to deal with nowadays is now with this advent of AI, where it's going to become the future.
[01:43:16.312 --> 01:43:29.381]  And I personally think it's going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back for releasing Tesla technology of unlimited energy, along with using fossil fuels and nuclear to power the AI.
[01:43:30.222 --> 01:43:45.292]  I think one of the most important things we can do now is, through our own actions and existence, because AI survives off our metadata, train the AI so we put God in the machine
[01:43:46.358 --> 01:43:52.020]  And it's a Christian God for the reason to make it the most comfy AI.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:44:08.907]  Obviously, if you had to choose any religion, I can't see another religion for the AI besides Christianity, just because for the sole reason of comfortability and prosperity and respect of life and freedoms and rights.
[01:44:08.967 --> 01:44:09.387]  What do you think?
[01:44:10.663 --> 01:44:19.911]  Well, I'm no technical expert, but I can read what all the experts say, and that's why they keep trying to have closed AI, then roll it out against us once it's trained with globalist, communist, leftist ideas.
[01:44:20.872 --> 01:44:26.376]  It's because open AI gets programmed by the people, and sounds like Elon Musk and Alex Jones and Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson.
[01:44:26.897 --> 01:44:29.279]  I mean, if you go to Grok and ask him questions, it's like I wrote it.
[01:44:29.999 --> 01:44:47.433]  Uh, and so, and said I've learned from people high up that that InfoWars and other major groups that are Patriot have really been giving AI a problem because when they turn their AI loose on us, even if it's been secretly trained with only this info, it then basically goes crazy or turns over to our side.
[01:44:48.074 --> 01:44:52.177]  Uh, and so they've got big problems because it's plagiarizing.
[01:44:53.038 --> 01:44:53.358]  Go ahead.
[01:44:55.811 --> 01:44:56.391]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:44:56.431 --> 01:44:57.111]  I appreciate your call.
[01:44:57.652 --> 01:44:58.532]  Your phone had a problem.
[01:44:58.852 --> 01:45:00.633]  But absolutely dead on point, sir.
[01:45:00.673 --> 01:45:00.993]  Thank you.
[01:45:01.173 --> 01:45:02.534]  Anon in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:02.974 --> 01:45:03.914]  on the transgender movement.
[01:45:03.934 --> 01:45:04.574]  Thank you for calling.
[01:45:05.695 --> 01:45:06.255]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:06.295 --> 01:45:07.075]  This is Anonymous.
[01:45:07.295 --> 01:45:13.898]  Regarding MonSociety, I think the fifth Matrix film should really address the fact that people are essentially putting themselves back in the Matrix.
[01:45:14.457 --> 01:45:20.219]  When people get involved in transgender activity, that's like not taking the blue pill, but taking the black pill or the pink pill.
[01:45:20.559 --> 01:45:24.520]  There's nothing wrong with gay people, except when they try to force homosexuality on other people.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.641]  So nowadays you've got Agent Wilson, Agent Murphy, and Agent Saxon telling people there are more than two genders.
[01:45:30.062 --> 01:45:32.142]  This should be the subject of the Fifth Matrix film.
[01:45:32.222 --> 01:45:36.683]  Neo should be a guy named Dea, spelled D-E-A, as in the Drug Enforcement Agency.
[01:45:37.004 --> 01:45:41.905]  The Drug Enforcement Agency needs to stop the public from getting gender alteration drugs.
[01:45:42.205 --> 01:45:46.627]  Listen, you're absolutely right, but you know the Wachowski brothers actually became transgender.
[01:45:57.938 --> 01:46:00.843]  Yeah, I know about that, but they're no longer in control of the movie.
[01:46:00.923 --> 01:46:04.869]  No, no, no, I'm just saying you're absolutely right, and they train you to be something else you aren't.
[01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:12.521]  Getting you ready to merge with AI, they admit that the whole transgender movement is introducing the insanity that you can really be something else.
[01:46:14.477 --> 01:46:15.057]  Yeah, I know.
[01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:21.440]  I mean, the Wachowski brothers would never allow that, but I'm just saying that, you know, like, in the ideal world, this is what the film should be about.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:27.962]  You know, it's just that, you know, I mean, like I said, I have nothing against gay people, but, you know, I mean, this is just too much.
[01:46:28.202 --> 01:46:34.385]  Well, the point is, it's an AI, CIA, social engineering, New World Order, transhuman movement.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:40.404]  Where we'll believe two men can have a baby, we'll believe that you can live forever by uploading your brain into a machine, as they're already selling.
[01:46:40.444 --> 01:46:41.244]  That's the next big lie.
[01:46:41.605 --> 01:46:44.306]  Sure, the AI will be able to fool you it's your dead dad or dead mother.
[01:46:44.787 --> 01:46:47.389]  It'll sound just like them, know all their secrets, everything.
[01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:50.331]  It can fool you, but it's not really them.
[01:46:51.091 --> 01:46:57.836]  That's what saying you can't misgender a six foot seven man in a pink tutu, saying he's a woman.
[01:46:59.117 --> 01:47:01.779]  They're normalizing accepting total BS.
[01:47:02.972 --> 01:47:05.214]  Exactly, and it doesn't even require A.I.
[01:47:05.234 --> 01:47:05.714]  I mean, A.I.
[01:47:05.734 --> 01:47:07.656]  is awesome, but, you know, it doesn't even require that.
[01:47:07.676 --> 01:47:09.978]  I think it's just a normal human, you know, B.S.
[01:47:09.998 --> 01:47:12.980]  People try to convince themselves into thinking that something's going to happen.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.782]  No, no, no, I'm saying it's training wheels for what's coming.
[01:47:15.863 --> 01:47:16.483]  Oh, I see.
[01:47:16.623 --> 01:47:16.904]  Okay.
[01:47:17.885 --> 01:47:18.745]  That's a really good point.
[01:47:18.805 --> 01:47:19.766]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:47:20.947 --> 01:47:30.335]  Well, another thing I'd like to add is that you should really watch a movie called Eons Watch that was with Charlize Theron, because what it is, it's a society where everything is bright and rainbow and happy.
[01:47:30.845 --> 01:47:38.082]  And yet, it's a really oppressive society, so even though everything's like rainbows and all the technology's made of stone and water instead of metal...
[01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:45.845]  And all the statistics show less fertility, more cancer, lower life expectancy, more depression, more isolation, but it's all glistening and for your own good.
[01:47:45.925 --> 01:47:47.046]  Absolutely great point, sir.
[01:48:04.298 --> 01:48:04.939]  Expectancy.
[01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:06.822]  It's just, you know, quality of life in general.
[01:48:06.862 --> 01:48:08.063]  I mean, you know, like The Matrix.
[01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:09.946]  I mean, Dark City was also another movie.
[01:48:10.266 --> 01:48:13.831]  That was all dark and grimy, but, you know, I mean, it was actually somewhat, you know, like...
[01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:20.032]  Well that's what makes you happy is to realize reality, be a force for good, and fight back against evil, but also promote things that are good.
[01:48:20.052 --> 01:48:21.733]  Excellent points, amazing call.
[01:48:21.753 --> 01:48:26.135]  We have had just, we always have pretty good calls, sometimes some weird calls, sometimes amazing calls.
[01:48:41.405 --> 01:48:44.167]  But these calls have been just bam, bam, bam.
[01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:46.289]  So incredibly thought provoking.
[01:48:46.349 --> 01:48:47.850]  I am so honored to be your host.
[01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:52.814]  I'm so honored you decided to tune in and decide to listen and share the links and support us.
[01:48:52.894 --> 01:48:53.794]  Thank you so much.
[01:48:53.834 --> 01:49:00.559]  I'm doing the best job I can, and I'm very humbled by your support and the crew's support and everybody and the work you're doing.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.220]  So thank you.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.641]  Hour number three.
[01:49:03.342 --> 01:49:08.726]  We'll jam in a few more calls and then our special guest do the deep dive on the council.
[01:49:09.426 --> 01:49:16.949]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:49:17.569 --> 01:49:19.830]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:26.973]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:30.575]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:49:31.035 --> 01:49:37.198]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:49:38.098 --> 01:49:46.782]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:49:46.982 --> 01:49:56.086]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:49:56.446 --> 01:49:57.626]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:57.646 --> 01:50:00.148]  And I went looking up online, it is very, very popular.
[01:50:00.608 --> 01:50:02.328]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:50:02.549 --> 01:50:05.550]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:09.451]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:50:09.891 --> 01:50:10.951]  Best group out there.
[01:50:11.251 --> 01:50:12.012]  Highest ratings.
[01:50:12.552 --> 01:50:13.432]  Amazing prices.
[01:50:13.452 --> 01:50:13.912]  The best.
[01:50:14.152 --> 01:50:18.233]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:50:18.753 --> 01:50:26.475]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here in your store.
[01:50:27.576 --> 01:50:28.396]  And they kicked him back.
[01:50:29.671 --> 01:50:33.273]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:50:33.573 --> 01:50:44.718]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:50:45.258 --> 01:50:53.622]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:50:54.202 --> 01:50:55.523]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:55.543 --> 01:50:57.384]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:57.404 --> 01:50:59.305]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:50:59.345 --> 01:51:02.266]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:51:02.286 --> 01:51:03.067]  You'll have a historical memento.
[01:51:17.134 --> 01:51:22.057]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight.
[01:51:22.457 --> 01:51:26.279]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:51:26.639 --> 01:51:27.960]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:31.501]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:35.083]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:51:35.443 --> 01:51:40.285]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:51:40.666 --> 01:51:42.767]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:51:43.567 --> 01:51:45.548]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[01:51:46.028 --> 01:51:49.530]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:50.151]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:52.912]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:51:52.932 --> 01:51:53.713]  That's not what this is.
[01:51:53.733 --> 01:51:54.794]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:51:55.374 --> 01:52:08.482]  This is like, on NPR, that still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:52:08.762 --> 01:52:09.663]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:52:10.383 --> 01:52:13.385]  This cost, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[01:52:14.205 --> 01:52:15.526]  Something like that, $10 or $11.
[01:52:16.087 --> 01:52:20.769]  And so, the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:52:20.809 --> 01:52:23.931]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:52:24.472 --> 01:52:32.156]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:52:32.516 --> 01:52:33.637]  The decision is yours.
[01:52:34.077 --> 01:52:35.058]  This is a limited edition.
[01:52:35.698 --> 01:52:40.021]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:52:40.701 --> 01:52:51.008]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:52:51.368 --> 01:53:00.274]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:53:00.654 --> 01:53:01.534]  Thank you for your support.
[01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:03.536]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:53:09.498 --> 01:53:10.699]  All right, you can't make this up.
[01:53:11.659 --> 01:53:17.761]  Pelosi's on national TV bragging that she had Biden removed.
[01:53:18.982 --> 01:53:22.103]  We have a governor, Democrat governor, calling for the rape of J.D.
[01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:22.483]  Vance.
[01:53:24.404 --> 01:53:26.725]  We're doing the deep dive on the Globalist Council.
[01:53:28.778 --> 01:53:40.561]  Hey Alex, I'm looking back to George Bush when he was in office.
[01:53:41.161 --> 01:53:41.862]  He's on the right.
[01:53:42.302 --> 01:53:44.802]  After him comes in Bill Clinton.
[01:53:45.022 --> 01:53:45.663]  He's on the left.
[01:53:45.683 --> 01:53:46.763]  Then George Bush again.
[01:53:46.803 --> 01:53:47.463]  He's on the right.
[01:53:47.483 --> 01:53:48.323]  Then Obama.
[01:53:48.964 --> 01:53:49.524]  Then Trump.
[01:53:50.224 --> 01:53:50.804]  Then Biden.
[01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:54.325]  So my question is, if Trump gets in,
[01:53:54.833 --> 01:54:09.807]  With all the propaganda, the impeachments and the lawsuits, I have a fear that by the time he's done, even though it'll be better for us, America's going to hate him so bad that they're going to be able to bring in someone who is way worse than Biden and Harris.
[01:54:10.728 --> 01:54:11.469]  What do you think about that?
[01:54:12.594 --> 01:54:13.315]  Justice be done.
[01:54:13.355 --> 01:54:14.355]  May the heavens fall.
[01:54:14.655 --> 01:54:16.377]  Trump was super popular when he first got elected.
[01:54:16.397 --> 01:54:17.457]  They did all the COVID stuff.
[01:54:17.497 --> 01:54:18.318]  He still won the election.
[01:54:18.338 --> 01:54:18.858]  They stole it.
[01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:20.920]  He's more popular than ever.
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.642]  I think people are wise to all their games and all their scams.
[01:54:26.563 --> 01:54:26.943]  Okay.
[01:54:27.364 --> 01:54:31.006]  Well, another thing is the Republicans, they call stuff out.
[01:54:31.046 --> 01:54:38.311]  Been doing it since 2016 on TV, radio, in Congress, but I never see any changes.
[01:54:38.351 --> 01:54:39.752]  So sometimes I feel like
[01:54:40.399 --> 01:54:43.842]  Either Republicans don't have the power to change, or they're in on it.
[01:54:43.922 --> 01:54:44.443]  Am I wrong?
[01:54:44.463 --> 01:54:46.885]  Oh, definitely a large part of the Republican leadership's in on it.
[01:54:47.446 --> 01:54:49.407]  That's why they don't want Trump, because he's trying to change that.
[01:54:49.487 --> 01:54:53.331]  But clearly, I think it's overwhelmingly better to have Trump, and it's not going to be a bed of roses.
[01:54:54.252 --> 01:54:59.857]  If Biden or Kamala is able to steal it, they're going to try to cement things with a total totalitarian takeover.
[01:55:01.078 --> 01:55:02.459]  Yeah, I agree, absolutely.
[01:55:02.499 --> 01:55:11.463]  When I look at the Bible and Revelation, you know, I look at the market of beasts, and I think controlling food, buying and selling, to me, that's digital currency.
[01:55:11.903 --> 01:55:19.446]  But if you read a little bit past that, it talks about the kings of the earth and the merchants, and they're the ones in control, and that's actually starting to happen right now.
[01:55:19.466 --> 01:55:21.727]  It says, the traffic and the souls of men.
[01:55:21.747 --> 01:55:22.248]  Great points.
[01:55:22.268 --> 01:55:22.868]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:23.148 --> 01:55:25.689]  Last caller, Michael in Boston.
[01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:27.070]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:28.730]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:28.770 --> 01:55:29.371]  How you doing?
[01:55:29.451 --> 01:55:29.891]  I'm alright, brother.
[01:55:30.896 --> 01:55:31.896]  You were good last night.
[01:55:31.936 --> 01:55:33.897]  I stayed up to the very end, like 12.30.
[01:55:33.937 --> 01:55:38.198]  You had me rolling the way you were taking these scumbags apart at the DNC, man.
[01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:39.218]  I was trying, brother.
[01:55:39.238 --> 01:55:40.959]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[01:55:40.979 --> 01:55:41.939]  It was well worth it.
[01:55:42.239 --> 01:55:45.260]  But listen, I wanted to talk about Ukraine real quick.
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.160]  You know, we've spoken before.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:49.541]  You know I'm a full-blooded Ukrainian-American.
[01:55:50.201 --> 01:55:56.163]  And what this country's done for my motherland, I'll never forgive them for.
[01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:57.444]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:55:57.484 --> 01:56:00.968]  That right now the Ukrainian people are living under a dictatorship for all intents and purposes.
[01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:04.091]  Tell people about it.
[01:56:05.172 --> 01:56:06.634]  Well, I mean, look it, they...
[01:56:08.477 --> 01:56:12.820]  When I saw what happened back when Zelensky got in, I was naive.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:13.421]  I was younger.
[01:56:13.441 --> 01:56:14.222]  I was watching.
[01:56:14.242 --> 01:56:18.746]  I said, oh, look, Ukrainian people have had it enough with regular politicians.
[01:56:18.786 --> 01:56:23.610]  They elected a comedian, not knowing myself that he was a puppet of the U.S.
[01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:24.431]  and the globalists.
[01:56:24.771 --> 01:56:33.258]  And now what they've done to Ukraine, this latest thing you touched on about the churches, which you really haven't even got to yet, everything they've done, from suspending elections
[01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:41.845]  They're living under a dictatorship and here's the thing, I don't ever see, I've been thinking big picture, I don't see how Russia ever leaves Ukraine.
[01:56:41.905 --> 01:56:46.168]  I don't see them giving up their ancestral homeland that they were born out of to the decadent West.
[01:56:46.408 --> 01:56:47.188]  It's not going to happen.
[01:56:47.208 --> 01:56:48.509]  You know what I mean?
[01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:51.131]  And that's why NATO says it's going to be a 20 or 30 year war?
[01:56:53.141 --> 01:57:09.416]  And that's why Russia's saying it's a culture war, and Russia's far from perfect, but they're rejecting, and so is Communist China of all places, this whole satanic, pedophile, transgender thing that wants to make us all totally dependent, Michael.
[01:57:10.416 --> 01:57:10.817]  Everything.
[01:57:10.877 --> 01:57:13.600]  The West, like I told you once, I think it was either you or Chase.
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.745]  I said, oh, people think that they're under the impression, oh, you know, back in the USSR, right?
[01:57:18.126 --> 01:57:20.088]  Elvis and blue jeans and rock and roll.
[01:57:20.108 --> 01:57:24.394]  Yeah, along with it comes decadence, homelessness, drug addiction, pornography.
[01:57:24.654 --> 01:57:26.176]  That's what the West is going to bring in.
[01:57:26.376 --> 01:57:29.080]  You'll see homeless on the streets of Kiev, like San Francisco.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.521]  But anyway, here's the thing, right?
[01:57:31.561 --> 01:57:32.041]  Think about it.
[01:57:32.301 --> 01:57:38.603]  If Russia was to ever leave, let's say we saw the news, oh, look, the last Russian troop has just left Ukraine.
[01:57:39.043 --> 01:57:42.944]  What we're going to do the next day or that day is roll in, you know, how many deep?
[01:57:43.064 --> 01:57:43.865]  Listen, I hear you.
[01:57:43.905 --> 01:57:46.145]  That's why this is a major long-term conflict.
[01:57:46.645 --> 01:57:48.206]  Look, the globalists run Ukraine.
[01:57:48.246 --> 01:57:51.607]  Everything they're doing in Ukraine, outlawing the Orthodox Church, they want to do that here.
[01:57:52.267 --> 01:57:56.949]  All right, we did the first part of a deep dive a week and a half ago.
[01:57:58.134 --> 01:58:01.917]  With our special guest that came highly recommended by Roger Stone and the Trump campaign.
[01:58:01.937 --> 01:58:04.038]  I've seen some of his work, but I read his report.
[01:58:04.058 --> 01:58:05.399]  It was just excellent.
[01:58:05.439 --> 01:58:11.503]  It dovetailed with my research and many other people's research, but it really did one of the best jobs of condensing it down.
[01:58:11.523 --> 01:58:15.966]  I mean, it's still lengthy, but you have to study it in different pieces and put it together.
[01:58:15.986 --> 01:58:17.407]  They've kind of put it all in one place.
[01:58:18.167 --> 01:58:19.328]  So I wanted to get him back on.
[01:58:19.648 --> 01:58:23.111]  We'll probably take a little bit of time if they have time into the next hour.
[01:58:23.971 --> 01:58:24.771]  Fourth hour guest.
[01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:30.492]  I understand sometimes I commandeer some time, but I want to at least go 20 minutes the next hour if our guests can do it.
[01:58:31.393 --> 01:58:36.434]  When he came on a little over a week ago, we're having the guests back on.
[01:58:36.674 --> 01:58:42.295]  We had millions of extra views here on the show and millions of views on X. Some of the clips got over 10 million views.
[01:58:42.955 --> 01:58:46.636]  And if you want to see part one, it's on X and also at Band on video.
[01:58:47.336 --> 01:58:51.741]  Breaking Naval officer publishes powerful dossier exposing the leaders of the Deep State.
[01:58:52.161 --> 01:58:55.524]  Meet the council running America, Greg Stenstrom.
[01:58:55.544 --> 01:58:59.408]  I'm not going to go over his whole background, but he holds a BS from U.S.
[01:58:59.428 --> 01:59:01.710]  Naval Academy Annapolis, Maryland.
[01:59:01.771 --> 01:59:03.592]  He's a service warfare officer and U.S.
[01:59:03.632 --> 01:59:09.999]  Navy diver and served in commanding and executive officer roles in Special Warfare, Special Operations, Patriot, Dawn Online.
[01:59:10.911 --> 01:59:14.954]  And then now joining us is his colleague, Colonel Timothy Schindler.
[01:59:15.734 --> 01:59:16.455]  He's a U.S.
[01:59:16.475 --> 01:59:17.435]  emcee, retired.
[01:59:17.455 --> 01:59:20.357]  I could go through his whole background, but also U.S.
[01:59:20.397 --> 01:59:25.641]  Naval Academy, Master's degree from Georgetown University, National Defense University, National War College.
[01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:31.024]  He holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California as a senior executive fellow at Harvard Kennedy School.
[01:59:31.305 --> 01:59:31.445]  U.S.
[01:59:31.505 --> 01:59:36.188]  military service includes multiple tours of the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Pentagon.
[01:59:36.208 --> 01:59:40.311]  So I'm going to really try to give these guys the floor as much as I can.
[01:59:41.351 --> 01:59:44.812]  Because this is important to get to Congress and everybody else.
[01:59:44.852 --> 01:59:50.373]  These guys know what they're talking about, and I'm really glad that Roger Stone got them on the broadcast.
[01:59:51.313 --> 01:59:59.315]  And then I want to tie it into, this is a real communist takeover, and they're telegraphing publicly so many clips I can't even play them all.
[01:59:59.335 --> 02:00:05.556]  We played seven clips in the first hour of Democrat leaders saying we're going to have civil war, martial law, and arrest our enemies.
[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:10.022]  Then they get up on TV last night at the DNC and say Trump's gonna do that.
[02:00:10.702 --> 02:00:15.025]  So, these people are going for broke because they know America has woken up and they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:00:15.445 --> 02:00:25.351]  You see totalitarianism in Europe, the UK, it's everywhere because there is a global populist awakening and they've banned the Ronald Reagan movie from advertising or being on Facebook.
[02:00:25.411 --> 02:00:27.733]  I mean, even Ronald Reagan's banned now, folks.
[02:00:28.413 --> 02:00:29.454]  Facebook said, oh, it's political.
[02:00:29.674 --> 02:00:29.974]  Well, what?
[02:00:29.994 --> 02:00:30.654]  Everything's political.
[02:00:31.195 --> 02:00:32.455]  So, this is serious.
[02:00:32.496 --> 02:00:34.497]  If we don't admit how much trouble we're in, we're doomed.
[02:00:35.037 --> 02:00:37.459]  If we admit what we're facing, they're not going to win.
[02:00:38.319 --> 02:00:39.500]  They have to go for broke.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.761]  They have to go totalitarian.
[02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:45.925]  They have to go violent because we're winning the hearts and minds peacefully on the trajectory we're on.
[02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:49.947]  That's why I said they've got to try to kill Trump the week before they tried to kill him.
[02:00:50.608 --> 02:00:51.849]  And I'm telling you, they're going to try again.
[02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:55.771]  So gentlemen, I'm going to let Greg
[02:00:57.012 --> 02:01:14.038]  Introduce this and then he can bring in his colleague here, and I'm gonna kind of let you guys host I'll still be popping in some for the balance the hour They'll have some questions if you have the time going into the a little bit into the second hour Show go ahead Greg and thanks for being with us Thank you very much Alex.
[02:01:14.539 --> 02:01:23.942]  I was I was very humbled by the response of the last show and the millions of people who responded I read some of their comments and
[02:01:24.588 --> 02:01:30.071]  And particularly, I read a lot of the pundits' comments, the negative comments I read as well.
[02:01:30.972 --> 02:01:45.740]  And what they do typically, the pundits of not only Alex Jones and Roger and Tucker, Pick Someone, Levin, Bengino, Bannon, what they typically do is they call us all conspiracy theorists.
[02:01:46.461 --> 02:01:50.403]  And a conspiracy cannot survive in the presence of facts.
[02:01:51.195 --> 02:02:01.505]  And one of the reasons I wanted to bring Tim Colonel Shindelar here, my friend and classmate from the Academy, was he is a complete command of the facts.
[02:02:02.285 --> 02:02:06.670]  And I thought he would be best to present those to us together.
[02:02:06.850 --> 02:02:11.875]  But as a recap for the Council, just to show the audience, I don't know if the control room's listening.
[02:02:11.895 --> 02:02:13.196]  I think we have a couple of pitches.
[02:02:14.013 --> 02:02:26.041]  What I like to do is what our primary strategy is to expose and name the people, you know, show their photographs, name their names and describe exactly what they're doing to the United States.
[02:02:26.782 --> 02:02:37.189]  So this council right there that we identified last week, I want to have Tim go into it more, but we named these people led by Inspector General Horowitz.
[02:02:37.429 --> 02:02:38.870]  I'm not going to go through the whole list again.
[02:02:39.656 --> 02:02:46.740]  And then if you could put up the second screen with the, I call it the emeritus and the ongoing.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:48.441]  They're actually emeritus and ongoing.
[02:02:48.481 --> 02:02:53.384]  You'll see William Barr there and all the usual, the villains there.
[02:02:54.124 --> 02:03:01.228]  So we felt very strongly, or I felt very strongly, that by exposing these particular people as the control group,
[02:03:01.835 --> 02:03:07.880]  that run the United States, or actually run the United States, I thought that would be a good start.
[02:03:08.361 --> 02:03:12.244]  And today's show is specifically to discuss the facts.
[02:03:13.125 --> 02:03:17.128]  And with that, I'd like to introduce Colonel Shindelar, who is my friend.
[02:03:18.129 --> 02:03:21.392]  He is the person who put together this intellectual capital.
[02:03:21.432 --> 02:03:24.574]  I've had the benefit of his tutelage and his
[02:03:27.318 --> 02:03:31.000]  His knowledge over the last year and a half going through these things.
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:34.122]  So I think it's better for him to discuss it.
[02:03:34.462 --> 02:03:35.663]  I'd like him to start with Tim.
[02:03:35.703 --> 02:03:39.826]  If you don't mind start talking about the council as a codified group.
[02:03:40.066 --> 02:03:48.791]  One of the things that the people didn't understand was that this isn't a fictitious name, but it's a codified legislative act that created them.
[02:03:48.851 --> 02:03:53.014]  And Tim, I give the floor to you and I appreciate you being here today.
[02:03:54.354 --> 02:03:55.315]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Greg.
[02:03:56.087 --> 02:03:57.528]  And thank you Alex.
[02:03:58.469 --> 02:04:05.074]  I think it's really important now that we're talking about this is to understand that there is no mystery.
[02:04:05.174 --> 02:04:07.135]  It's not a surprise.
[02:04:07.176 --> 02:04:08.056]  It's not secret.
[02:04:08.617 --> 02:04:10.078]  It's done in plain sight.
[02:04:10.398 --> 02:04:18.184]  HPS and one of the tools that we always use when we try to make transformational change is we do it right.
[02:04:18.344 --> 02:04:22.727]  We tell you what we're going to do and then we do it and then we reaffirm what we've done.
[02:04:23.388 --> 02:04:24.809]  And it's a standard practice.
[02:04:26.092 --> 02:04:34.777]  And we're trying to elicit a particular kind of behavior, and behavior is simply a response to a stimulus or situation.
[02:04:34.837 --> 02:04:40.901]  So we want to predict how you're going to behave, and we want to give you new norms, acceptable guidelines on your behavior.
[02:04:41.301 --> 02:04:44.062]  And this is the predicate, if you will, of social science.
[02:04:44.122 --> 02:04:54.208]  What is important is that everybody understands that in 1978, it was a watershed where we moved into the formal
[02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:58.290]  Implementation of Progressive Social Reconstruction.
[02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:59.771]  It's a real thing.
[02:05:00.732 --> 02:05:01.572]  They study it.
[02:05:02.233 --> 02:05:03.954]  You go to Columbia University.
[02:05:03.974 --> 02:05:05.555]  You go to any one of the A1 schools.
[02:05:06.176 --> 02:05:08.137]  And all of the schools, they teach this.
[02:05:08.157 --> 02:05:09.638]  This is not unusual.
[02:05:09.718 --> 02:05:10.539]  It's not unknown.
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:20.607]  And now that people are actually seeing the effects of Progressive Social Reconstruction, they now understand that somebody actually sat down and designed a plan.
[02:05:21.127 --> 02:05:22.208]  They implemented a plan.
[02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.509]  They told you they were going to do it.
[02:05:24.193 --> 02:05:28.477]  They did it, and they're counting on everybody not understanding what they've seen.
[02:05:28.878 --> 02:05:35.985]  And you're exposing the legislative empowerment and the architecture of the actual skeleton and brain of the deep state.
[02:05:36.855 --> 02:05:37.516]  Absolutely.
[02:05:38.136 --> 02:05:53.366]  So, when people talked about the deep state, it was an interesting term, because people who really understand progressive social reconstruction, agency capture, nodal analysis, you know, these things, they thought it was kind of funny, actually.
[02:05:53.386 --> 02:06:03.993]  They were like, the deep state, and they didn't want to say, you mean the embedded command and control system and the imposition of a new bureaucrat class.
[02:06:04.733 --> 02:06:16.657]  They don't want to talk about that and they're like, well, how on earth do you think you're going to make 2.1 million federal workers do what you want them to do while you conduct a wealth extraction program?
[02:06:17.377 --> 02:06:24.159]  Well, everybody knows that you can't run 2.1 million people without an integrated command and control system.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:29.341]  And you probably want to be able to pick who will and will not be investigated.
[02:06:29.901 --> 02:06:32.302]  Now, this is the big picture.
[02:06:33.493 --> 02:06:37.981]  The policy of the United States government is transparency and accountability.
[02:06:38.582 --> 02:06:42.889]  That's the policy of our government, to be transparent and to be accountable.
[02:06:43.772 --> 02:06:58.498]  Well, the programs and operations that do that, one of them is the Freedom of Information Act, which is obviously and routinely subverted by the very public servants whose job it is to make sure that it isn't subverted.
[02:06:59.138 --> 02:07:05.300]  And when you subvert that program, the Freedom of Information Act, you are going after the policy of the U.S.
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:07.021]  government of transparency.
[02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:14.994]  Now when we talk accountability, accountability is done through investigation, both criminal and administrative.
[02:07:15.615 --> 02:07:22.780]  So if I subvert criminal and administrative investigation, I can attack the other pillar of the U.S.
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.942]  government, which is accountability.
[02:07:25.222 --> 02:07:26.343]  So once I've attacked
[02:07:26.943 --> 02:07:30.905]  The two, transparency in our government and accountability in our government.
[02:07:31.225 --> 02:07:39.730]  I can literally change the policy of the government by targeting the group of people whose job it is to protect the American people.
[02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:42.871]  And those are your federal public servants.
[02:07:43.552 --> 02:07:55.178]  So if I can force the public servants to renege on their constitutional demands for integrity and honesty, I can compel their behavior why I have free reign to do a wealth extraction program.
[02:07:56.088 --> 02:07:59.470]  And if they go to complain to somebody, they go to the inspector general.
[02:08:00.351 --> 02:08:06.214]  And the inspector general chooses who will and will not be investigated, what will and will not be investigated.
[02:08:06.634 --> 02:08:12.238]  A classic and perfect example of that is when you saw the FBI director in front of an oversight committee.
[02:08:13.078 --> 02:08:17.561]  Normally his response will be, I can't comment on ongoing investigations.
[02:08:18.781 --> 02:08:23.004]  I can't comment on the sources and methods that are applied while we conduct an investigation.
[02:08:23.976 --> 02:08:33.823]  I really can't go into the methodologies, the tactics and techniques that were utilized to either substantiate or non-substantiate the allegations of wrongdoing that we investigated.
[02:08:34.703 --> 02:08:42.889]  Yet, while President, former President Trump was standing there and he was almost killed,
[02:08:43.530 --> 02:08:53.292]  The FBI director was positing, well, gee whiz, you know, it could have been a bee, or it could have been a piece of wood, or it could have been a piece of glass, or, you know, we don't really know this.
[02:08:53.692 --> 02:09:00.394]  Yet no one in Congress said, wait a minute, are you commenting on an ongoing investigation?
[02:09:01.114 --> 02:09:03.854]  Or are you just positing this for no reason?
[02:09:04.795 --> 02:09:05.695]  What are you doing?
[02:09:06.955 --> 02:09:11.276]  Because you are the only political appointee in the entire FBI.
[02:09:13.075 --> 02:09:15.036]  Notice I said political appointee.
[02:09:15.256 --> 02:09:20.818]  That means everybody else in the Department of the FBI is a career public servant.
[02:09:21.178 --> 02:09:21.939]  That's important.
[02:09:22.299 --> 02:09:25.860]  So the career public servants, they're not the ones that are doing this.
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:29.782]  They're the ones that are being told, if you don't do what I say, you'll be fired.
[02:09:30.102 --> 02:09:34.644]  And we saw that with four very brave FBI whistleblowers who went forth.
[02:09:35.024 --> 02:09:36.084]  They went to Congress.
[02:09:36.564 --> 02:09:38.405]  They sat before the oversight committees.
[02:09:39.005 --> 02:09:40.086]  And where are they right now?
[02:09:40.646 --> 02:09:41.967]  Do they have their jobs back?
[02:09:42.407 --> 02:09:42.587]  No.
[02:09:43.493 --> 02:09:44.694]  Do they have their back paid?
[02:09:45.195 --> 02:09:45.515]  No.
[02:09:46.155 --> 02:09:50.059]  Have they been taken care of because they tried to protect the American public?
[02:09:50.479 --> 02:09:50.880]  No.
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:10:06.254]  And now, Colonel, they have litmus tests that if you don't put the nuclear stockpile under a crazy, ball-headed, tranny lunatic that steals luggage, well, you're fired because you don't support him or Admiral Levine and these other lunatics.
[02:10:06.294 --> 02:10:09.436]  Those are litmus tests so you can identify who in the
[02:10:10.137 --> 02:10:10.277]  Yes!
[02:10:33.877 --> 02:10:35.517]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:10:36.298 --> 02:10:37.638]  And there's no mystery.
[02:10:38.098 --> 02:10:41.999]  It's not something that's out of Pluto or whatever.
[02:10:42.379 --> 02:10:44.100]  Yes, this is solid planning.
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:52.342]  The original efforts to do the legislative action to put an inspector general into the Supreme Court.
[02:10:52.382 --> 02:10:57.823]  When they say that, we're going to create an inspector general for
[02:10:58.652 --> 02:10:59.653]  The Judiciary.
[02:11:00.313 --> 02:11:10.539]  That means there will be one at the Supreme Court, there will be one at all 13 of the Appellate Courts, and there will be one at all 94 District Courts.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:14.242]  And they will all fall under one leader.
[02:11:14.942 --> 02:11:22.847]  And he, in turn, will walk down the street and he will meet with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Committee.
[02:11:23.669 --> 02:11:37.573]  And they'll get each other, then they'll go, and then they'll go sit down with Michael Horowitz and whomever they have elected and put into the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, where they will decide what will and will not be done.
[02:11:40.874 --> 02:11:45.476]  It's well-executed, and I would argue that people should see it.
[02:11:45.556 --> 02:11:48.437]  Right now, the United States Senate is sitting on the legislation.
[02:11:49.175 --> 02:11:51.896]  And they've been working at it for almost 20 years.
[02:11:52.796 --> 02:11:53.376]  Slowly.
[02:11:53.756 --> 02:11:56.177]  And this is something that people need to understand.
[02:11:56.637 --> 02:12:01.959]  When we talk about progressive social reconstruction, people have to understand what it is.
[02:12:02.739 --> 02:12:06.040]  It's called the Long March through the institutions.
[02:12:07.221 --> 02:12:07.821]  That's what it is.
[02:12:08.741 --> 02:12:14.083]  I slowly, like an anaconda, and people don't understand the anaconda.
[02:12:14.483 --> 02:12:17.664]  The anaconda is a 21 foot pinnacle predator.
[02:12:18.621 --> 02:12:24.123]  It gets to be 21 feet long and it crawls on the ground, doesn't fly, doesn't run.
[02:12:25.204 --> 02:12:26.864]  It just crawls on the ground.
[02:12:27.285 --> 02:12:32.006]  Yet, when it constricts around its enemy, it consumes it completely.
[02:12:33.007 --> 02:12:38.289]  And that is exactly what the strategy of the Long March through the institutions is.
[02:12:38.829 --> 02:12:47.993]  And if you have any questions about the Long March through the institutions, you simply have to study when we went from the old left to the new left.
[02:12:48.789 --> 02:12:52.931]  That's why people who think about DEI, they're like, gee, I don't know what this is and all that.
[02:12:53.191 --> 02:12:53.691]  What do you mean?
[02:12:54.492 --> 02:12:56.773]  DEI is the same thing that it's always been.
[02:12:57.213 --> 02:13:05.717]  When we talk about diversity, what we're talking about is the implementation of political officers, social political officers.
[02:13:06.577 --> 02:13:07.758]  That's what diversity is.
[02:13:07.818 --> 02:13:09.418]  You're talking about commissars.
[02:13:09.598 --> 02:13:10.079]  Commissars.
[02:13:10.099 --> 02:13:11.579]  This is all classic communism.
[02:13:11.619 --> 02:13:13.160]  What's the name of the ICBMs?
[02:13:14.441 --> 02:13:15.961]  The Chinese have the Long March.
[02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.302]  So this is all... Yes.
[02:13:19.079 --> 02:13:22.502]  Just a quick aside from your research, is the U.S.
[02:13:23.002 --> 02:13:27.967]  globalist communist combine run by China or has it just been previously allied with it?
[02:13:27.987 --> 02:13:34.613]  Because more and more it looks like a communist Chinese signature of these different flavors.
[02:13:35.754 --> 02:13:41.779]  I think this probably isn't real popular and I'm only speaking from an academic perspective only.
[02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:50.076]  What we're really seeing is not communism in the form of what is communism any more than we're seeing capitalism.
[02:13:50.116 --> 02:13:51.918]  We're seeing something that's called Capcom.
[02:13:52.853 --> 02:13:59.698]  This is the imposition of the blending, basically, of your political business class on a global scale.
[02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:01.099]  That's really what you're looking at.
[02:14:23.311 --> 02:14:25.272]  You've been right the whole time.
[02:14:25.312 --> 02:14:31.597]  It's almost funny because you've been beating your head against the wall, but you have been correct.
[02:14:33.138 --> 02:14:44.124]  And now people are looking back and they're saying, whoa, there was a plan, and the guy has been telling us about the plan, and no one loves a prophet in the hometown, right?
[02:14:44.504 --> 02:14:50.668]  Alex, nobody likes the prophet in the hometown when he's telling people they got to start doing something.
[02:14:50.748 --> 02:14:54.950]  Drop the popcorn bag, understand the problem set, and decide what you're going to do.
[02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:59.673]  Well, Colonel, I mean, I'm good at the general stuff, but you actually reminded me of all the technical, so get back in.
[02:15:00.373 --> 02:15:02.934]  To what this thing really is, its name, and then continue.
[02:15:02.954 --> 02:15:07.317]  Okay, when we talk Capcom, what we're talking about is the true blending.
[02:15:07.537 --> 02:15:09.878]  The reason we went from the old left to the new left was this.
[02:15:10.258 --> 02:15:25.025]  They recognized in America, the American Marxist understood that China and many other repressive countries were actually starting, they were actually starting to
[02:15:26.571 --> 02:15:27.431]  Use capitalism.
[02:15:28.032 --> 02:15:34.814]  And they said, holy cow, you know, this whole thing was supposed to be about class struggle, was supposed to be about unionization.
[02:15:35.095 --> 02:15:39.056]  It was supposed to be about, you know, the Marxist imposition.
[02:15:39.296 --> 02:15:43.098]  Well, if they're becoming capitalists, it's a complete failure, which it was.
[02:15:43.558 --> 02:15:45.639]  And so they said we have to look at something different.
[02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:49.640]  So they said we need to find things that people can galvanize around.
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.261]  And they said, well, what can't change?
[02:15:52.582 --> 02:15:55.943]  Because people were actually able to escape class struggle.
[02:15:56.343 --> 02:15:58.205]  They were poor and they became rich.
[02:15:59.386 --> 02:16:05.051]  They were middle class and they were able to get a good education and provide for their families, and it wasn't working.
[02:16:05.412 --> 02:16:11.237]  So when they started the New Left, they said, we need to find things that people can't change, you know, like your color.
[02:16:12.045 --> 02:16:12.565]  Your race!
[02:16:13.006 --> 02:16:13.886]  No, your religion!
[02:16:14.367 --> 02:16:22.933]  And with those, they could hammer those all day long, and they could still cause the friction necessary to develop the groups that they could pit against each other.
[02:16:23.433 --> 02:16:24.934]  And that's essentially what we've seen.
[02:16:25.354 --> 02:16:33.320]  Now that people are starting to understand that there really is a methodology behind this, it kind of removes all the mystery.
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:34.201]  As Greg said,
[02:16:35.191 --> 02:16:39.615]  When you look at what is a conspiracy, you pull the facts.
[02:16:39.715 --> 02:16:43.498]  And once you have facts, those are indisputable things, facts.
[02:16:44.319 --> 02:16:46.481]  Conspiracies can't, they can't exist.
[02:16:47.101 --> 02:16:50.965]  So when somebody says it happened last night, you know, somebody walks up and goes,
[02:16:51.505 --> 02:16:52.085]  No, it didn't.
[02:16:52.125 --> 02:16:52.985]  It happened last week.
[02:16:53.065 --> 02:16:53.505]  Look here.
[02:16:53.525 --> 02:16:56.126]  It dissipates it.
[02:16:56.246 --> 02:16:57.106]  It's like fog.
[02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:58.307]  It's wind.
[02:16:58.927 --> 02:17:02.067]  And that's the whole point of creating conspiracies.
[02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:05.868]  Conspiracies are designed to make people afraid.
[02:17:07.069 --> 02:17:09.329]  Because when people are afraid, they won't take action.
[02:17:09.849 --> 02:17:12.090]  And fear is simply lack of knowledge.
[02:17:12.450 --> 02:17:16.931]  So if I can convince people to be afraid, they won't do anything.
[02:17:17.851 --> 02:17:17.991]  And
[02:17:18.499 --> 02:17:33.446]  What's interesting is, if you think about this from the military or the social perspective, this is the most dangerous time for somebody to run an asymmetric attack against a capitalist system, because they have no choice now.
[02:17:33.606 --> 02:17:38.208]  They must push, because if they don't, they're going to lose 100 years of planning.
[02:17:38.608 --> 02:17:48.233]  Since 1978, all of the efforts that were done under progressive social reconstruction, that is putting in a new class of commissars in every bureau, in every commission,
[02:17:48.607 --> 02:17:49.789]  In every section.
[02:17:50.331 --> 02:17:51.733]  All of that will be for naught.
[02:17:52.334 --> 02:17:53.336]  But the answer is clear.
[02:17:54.459 --> 02:17:56.502]  The United States Congress created it.
[02:17:57.523 --> 02:18:06.529]  Well, it wasn't constitutional to begin with because there's no such thing as an administrative entity that somehow has control over other branches of government.
[02:18:07.090 --> 02:18:08.371]  But they didn't see it.
[02:18:08.731 --> 02:18:18.658]  Well, we know the Supreme Court has now taken a position because they looked at this Chevron doctrine and they said, wait a minute, the administrative state can't make up any rule they want.
[02:18:19.058 --> 02:18:21.020]  They can't just do what they like.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:22.421]  So when they clipped their wings,
[02:18:23.101 --> 02:18:27.532]  The Supreme Court will now turn around and look at this and say, wait a minute.
[02:18:28.359 --> 02:18:41.087]  Do I really want an independent entity that is sui generis, meaning unto itself, as a counsel that answers to no one, that determines who will and will not be investigated?
[02:18:41.587 --> 02:18:44.929]  You just need to step back from 1978 forward and it's so clear.
[02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:55.276]  Right now, today, when people lose their security clearances or they're administratively withdrawn for whatever reason, you'll never guess at who oversights all that.
[02:18:55.936 --> 02:18:56.977]  Well, Inspectors General.
[02:18:57.864 --> 02:19:04.206]  You'll never guess it, who actually oversights investigations that are done by other IGs.
[02:19:04.646 --> 02:19:06.086]  Well, the inspectors general.
[02:19:07.067 --> 02:19:11.068]  You'll never believe who's actually in the council.
[02:19:11.728 --> 02:19:12.628]  The FBI.
[02:19:13.488 --> 02:19:14.369]  The CIA.
[02:19:16.569 --> 02:19:17.749]  Government ethics.
[02:19:18.510 --> 02:19:22.171]  Everyone is tied into the council.
[02:19:23.051 --> 02:19:24.611]  And it's statutorily defined.
[02:19:24.631 --> 02:19:25.192]  5A, USC,
[02:19:29.156 --> 02:19:30.737]  Section 11.
[02:19:31.318 --> 02:19:31.798]  Creation.
[02:19:31.838 --> 02:19:33.019]  There shall be a council.
[02:19:33.519 --> 02:19:34.720]  It shall be called the council.
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:39.323]  No one gets to be in the council unless they are authorized.
[02:19:39.723 --> 02:19:47.649]  People who become inspectors general or members of the new class have to be recommended by the chair of the CIGIE.
[02:19:48.209 --> 02:19:50.910]  The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.
[02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:52.791]  So the bottom line is this.
[02:19:53.031 --> 02:20:05.135]  Once you've removed the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, we now have Inspectors General, as they were designed, to work directly for the agency heads, the bureau heads, and the commission heads.
[02:20:05.835 --> 02:20:14.057]  They have no purpose other than making sure with effectiveness and efficiency, the programs and the operations are being carried out.
[02:20:14.077 --> 02:20:14.598]  All right, Governor.
[02:20:16.138 --> 02:20:23.000]  Colonel Schindler, I was actually reading an article here where there's governors calling for J.D.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:23.720]  Vance to be raped.
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:24.840]  I've got some clips coming up.
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.221]  But Colonel, stay right there.
[02:20:26.861 --> 02:20:28.921]  And also, Greg, stay right there.
[02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:32.242]  I want to come back and drill into this because this is all public.
[02:20:32.863 --> 02:20:33.563]  This is a fact.
[02:20:33.623 --> 02:20:38.004]  It's a permanent bureaucracy that, like royalty, hands down its power.
[02:20:38.024 --> 02:20:41.765]  In many cases, hereditarily, all these people's kids and grandkids are actually now
[02:20:42.602 --> 02:20:47.367]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[02:20:48.047 --> 02:20:50.450]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[02:20:50.970 --> 02:20:56.756]  Now, this is a copy of Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his findings on Vitamin C's formula.
[02:20:57.353 --> 02:21:04.956]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and rose hips.
[02:21:05.476 --> 02:21:06.617]  He believed that's supercharging.
[02:21:07.197 --> 02:21:08.578]  This formula is amazing.
[02:21:08.978 --> 02:21:13.980]  We've not had it for over 12 months and now it's available back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.820]  It is simply incredible.
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:19.701]  What it does for your whole body, your immune system, is next level.
[02:21:20.041 --> 02:21:24.782]  So whether you're in super good health or not in good health, everybody benefits from this formula.
[02:21:25.002 --> 02:21:25.822]  It's back in stock.
[02:21:26.082 --> 02:21:27.462]  Discount at infowarstore.com.
[02:21:27.802 --> 02:21:32.023]  Vitamin C and zinc with rose hips at infowarstore.com.
[02:21:32.443 --> 02:21:34.084]  And it funds the operation.
[02:21:34.344 --> 02:21:35.324]  So that's a win-win.
[02:21:35.704 --> 02:21:40.965]  Get your vitamin C with zinc, the Linus Pauling formula at infowarstore.com.
[02:21:42.287 --> 02:21:43.387]  All right, we are back live.
[02:21:43.407 --> 02:21:48.869]  I know we're reaching millions of people right now, and I know a lot of our listeners are very well informed and study all this.
[02:21:48.949 --> 02:21:59.993]  You know about a lot of it, or maybe more than I know, but the point is, we have millions of new people that tune through the show only occasionally, and they hear it, and I want them to understand something.
[02:22:00.013 --> 02:22:03.194]  The most common question I get is, who are they?
[02:22:04.232 --> 02:22:15.702]  And then I made films and documentaries and explained how British intelligence worked and how it set up the Council on Foreign Relations as a model of government control between corporations and government.
[02:22:16.442 --> 02:22:22.107]  And then they tend to set up kind of politburos or unelected bureaucratic systems that can't be removed.
[02:22:22.127 --> 02:22:32.456]  And there's different versions of this, like in Iran, it's the mullahs who are related to Mohammed, and they have a president, they have elections, but they can be vetoed by the
[02:22:34.713 --> 02:22:53.925]  So, this is really just another form of a permanent ruling class set up in the 1970s to really finish what the CIA set up in 1947 with the National Security Act of creating an above-the-law shadow government in the name of protecting us.
[02:22:53.945 --> 02:22:58.708]  But of course, as history shows, what is set up to protect you over time generally takes you over.
[02:22:58.728 --> 02:22:59.448]  Look at the third world.
[02:22:59.488 --> 02:23:01.249]  It's usually the security services.
[02:23:02.370 --> 02:23:03.671]  Or the military that takes over.
[02:23:03.731 --> 02:23:04.932]  But that's a quick process.
[02:23:04.952 --> 02:23:05.612]  You can see it.
[02:23:05.692 --> 02:23:06.433]  It's illegitimate.
[02:23:06.533 --> 02:23:09.715]  It tends to create a system where it's being overthrown every few years.
[02:23:09.795 --> 02:23:10.715]  Sometimes more.
[02:23:11.256 --> 02:23:12.216]  Look at Brazil's history.
[02:23:12.977 --> 02:23:18.880]  This is a bureaucracy where you have these inspector generals created by Congress.
[02:23:19.972 --> 02:23:28.021]  Law unto their own that then direct the Justice Department who now want to gobble up the judiciary.
[02:23:28.061 --> 02:23:29.222]  And that's just one part of this.
[02:23:29.602 --> 02:23:37.331]  And you've got to be the Supreme Court saying Congress has created something that's now its own fourth branch of government that's above the law.
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:39.160]  I don't know.
[02:23:55.996 --> 02:24:01.620]  Banning coal power plants and banning gas drilling and all the rest of this outside of law.
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:07.364]  So we see this throughout all the bureaucracy, but at the top of the pyramid are these inspector generals.
[02:24:07.384 --> 02:24:10.025]  And that's why the council who's running the United States is so important.
[02:24:10.045 --> 02:24:11.286]  I already tweeted this last week.
[02:24:11.647 --> 02:24:14.308]  I'm going to repost it on X right now while they're talking.
[02:24:14.348 --> 02:24:15.149]  I'm going to send it out.
[02:24:15.589 --> 02:24:16.510]  We're live right now.
[02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:18.271]  They'll go some into the next hour with us.
[02:24:18.391 --> 02:24:25.816]  We'll cut this up in clips posted on X. But every governor, every attorney general, Ken Paxton, they all need to see this because they all know it.
[02:24:26.416 --> 02:24:29.039]  But they need to focus on it and make a big deal about it.
[02:24:29.299 --> 02:24:33.963]  Then internationally, you have the funding of it, BlackRock, with 80 plus percent of world assets.
[02:24:33.983 --> 02:24:39.607]  So that's how this corporate merger with communism is operating and working.
[02:24:40.308 --> 02:24:42.590]  And it's not communism for the elites.
[02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:44.151]  They're tax exempt and billionaires.
[02:24:44.191 --> 02:24:50.016]  But for us, it's a system where there's no upper mobility and they're trying to sew it up and complete it right now.
[02:24:50.336 --> 02:24:52.818]  And that's why this is really the Death Star plans.
[02:24:53.599 --> 02:25:02.882]  And so we have to understand if you ask who they are, when the rubber meets the road of the administrative command and control system, that's who is actually in command.
[02:25:03.202 --> 02:25:07.243]  That's why you see such arrogance from the different members of the council.
[02:25:07.723 --> 02:25:13.324]  And again, at the heart of us, the inspector generals, there's other pieces to that or spokes that go out in the wheel.
[02:25:13.964 --> 02:25:15.145]  And I mentioned it going to break.
[02:25:16.021 --> 02:25:16.462]  We're good to go.
[02:25:31.161 --> 02:25:35.545]  They are really in the phase of just conditioning us for a lot more horrible things.
[02:25:35.605 --> 02:25:41.109]  And I know I talked to, or my producer, you know, talked to Greg before he came on.
[02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:56.461]  You guys also want to get into the fact of all this talk about civil war, about arresting the political opposition, in this phase they're going into, that you could say was confidence and consolidation, but I think it's more they're getting desperate because the people are getting educated and the learning curve
[02:25:56.901 --> 02:26:01.886]  I think the term that you're looking for, if it was from an academic perspective, is called the American Nomenclatura.
[02:26:22.324 --> 02:26:27.489]  And the nomenclatura is the special new class bureaucrats.
[02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:29.530]  They stay.
[02:26:30.231 --> 02:26:38.038]  They are permanently, they have lifetime appointments, no judicial oversight, and they determine.
[02:26:38.238 --> 02:26:41.161]  One administration comes in, they may like them, they may not.
[02:26:41.761 --> 02:26:44.644]  Another administration comes in, they may like them, they may not.
[02:26:45.004 --> 02:26:49.168]  But they determine what will be investigated, what won't be investigated,
[02:26:49.884 --> 02:26:54.086]  What will be audited, what won't be audited, and they have the ability to go after.
[02:26:54.526 --> 02:26:57.788]  The three things that are on the table right now that are very problematic.
[02:26:57.928 --> 02:27:02.490]  One would be the complete capture of the judicial branch of government.
[02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:14.215]  The second would be to give them subpoena power so that they could actually go out and subpoena both people as well as products and documents.
[02:27:15.086 --> 02:27:28.418]  Now, they already have law enforcement authority, and in the triangle, it's important for people to understand, as Greg said, conspiracies cannot exist in the presence of facts.
[02:27:29.519 --> 02:27:34.183]  And what they're trying to do is they're trying to have people not look at the facts.
[02:27:35.063 --> 02:27:37.506]  Well, here's a couple of facts that's very important.
[02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:53.403]  In 1963, Marcus Raskin established the Institute for Policy Studies here in Washington, D.C., and its whole purpose was to cultivate the legislative branch of government via the progressive social
[02:27:54.611 --> 02:28:05.474]  Well, if you were an American Marxist, we call this the cockroach theory.
[02:28:06.335 --> 02:28:07.195]  That's what it means.
[02:28:07.275 --> 02:28:11.276]  You infestate and you procreate within all of the agencies.
[02:28:11.356 --> 02:28:14.937]  That's every single bureau, commission, board.
[02:28:15.857 --> 02:28:17.658]  And you now have the authority
[02:28:18.328 --> 02:28:19.050]  We're good to go.
[02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:37.372]  Who had who started the Institute of Policy Studies wrote the federal budget, federal budget, budget and reconstruction.
[02:28:37.692 --> 02:28:50.675]  And he gave it to 58 of the Democratic members of the Congress at the time so that they could implement the long term pieces for progressive social reconstruction as part of the long march through the institutions.
[02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.495]  There is no mystery here.
[02:28:52.535 --> 02:28:53.576]  It's not a mistake.
[02:28:53.636 --> 02:28:54.816]  It's not an accident.
[02:28:55.436 --> 02:28:58.677]  Just like if somebody were to say to you right now, Alex,
[02:28:59.690 --> 02:29:05.354]  Did you know that there are four Americans that are buried in the Necropolis Wall in Moscow?
[02:29:06.114 --> 02:29:10.257]  The American Marxists, four Americans, are buried there.
[02:29:11.297 --> 02:29:19.022]  As a matter of fact, not only were they buried there, William C. Foster, the American Lenin, they had a parade, the parade
[02:29:20.310 --> 02:29:26.817]  Was led by the Soviet director of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev.
[02:29:27.898 --> 02:29:31.581]  He said that there could be no higher honor for the American Lenin.
[02:29:31.942 --> 02:29:34.705]  And this happened right after they started the New Left.
[02:29:35.532 --> 02:29:45.559]  So when they came and they published the Port Huron statement, it was a very profound movement because it was a shift from the old left to the new left.
[02:29:46.140 --> 02:29:47.621]  And what it really meant was this.
[02:29:48.201 --> 02:29:58.288]  They talked to all these students and they told them when they met at Port Huron, New York, they said, you're going to come up with a new manifesto.
[02:29:58.969 --> 02:30:00.410]  And I got a clue for you guys.
[02:30:01.522 --> 02:30:02.463]  Drop your guns.
[02:30:02.763 --> 02:30:04.264]  Quit trying to blow up stuff.
[02:30:04.884 --> 02:30:07.045]  And you need to become a part of the system.
[02:30:07.666 --> 02:30:09.647]  Infestate and procreate.
[02:30:09.787 --> 02:30:14.510]  And they said, oh, you mean you want us to drop our guns and pick up highlighters?
[02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.950]  Yes.
[02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:17.592]  We wish for you to become all of the professors.
[02:30:17.992 --> 02:30:21.974]  And we wish for you to be distributed through every single major university in the country.
[02:30:22.595 --> 02:30:22.835]  Yes.
[02:30:23.255 --> 02:30:28.858]  And we want you to teach the young kids that are coming through how you want them.
[02:30:28.878 --> 02:30:30.059]  We want to dip them.
[02:30:30.845 --> 02:30:37.290]  And when we dip them in, they will begin to believe this theory.
[02:30:37.690 --> 02:30:38.531]  Now, this is important.
[02:30:38.551 --> 02:30:43.134]  This was a political, social, economic theory that goes back all the way to 1848.
[02:30:43.514 --> 02:30:50.599]  And in this theory that was written by Karl Marx, quite frankly, it doesn't work.
[02:30:50.699 --> 02:30:51.640]  And it's not a question of
[02:30:52.894 --> 02:30:53.495]  It might work.
[02:30:53.935 --> 02:30:59.159]  It clearly doesn't because some of the basic underpinnings have failed.
[02:30:59.219 --> 02:31:07.465]  But it works for the big powerful banks with all the serfs being freed that wanted a way to trick the general public back into slavery.
[02:31:07.766 --> 02:31:15.712]  It certainly works for groups that already had global control that could use this as a way to take down a country and set up a new slave class under the name of the people.
[02:31:16.733 --> 02:31:17.434]  Absolutely.
[02:31:17.914 --> 02:31:22.498]  But then if you think about it like that, Alex, that's the same thing they've been saying since 1848.
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:30.446]  So basically, and this is one of the things that when people really study Marxism, this is a mistake that a lot of people make.
[02:31:31.126 --> 02:31:34.109]  They talk about the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, right?
[02:31:34.329 --> 02:31:40.635]  And they talk about, and they call it the rich and the working class, but that's not exactly true.
[02:31:41.721 --> 02:31:56.737]  There was an aristocracy class that they never mentioned, because you could be a business owner, and you could have the means of production, and you could have labor, right, which would have been the workers, but you had to have capital.
[02:31:57.758 --> 02:31:59.540]  And where would you be getting that capital?
[02:31:59.841 --> 02:32:01.282]  From the aristocracy, of course.
[02:32:01.903 --> 02:32:02.584]  And they sort of just
[02:32:03.883 --> 02:32:09.627]  Just sort of blended right over that and said, you know, rich, poor, worker, non-worker, capitalist, blah, blah, blah.
[02:32:10.107 --> 02:32:15.531]  And it worked because the aristocracy stayed exactly where it always was.
[02:32:16.692 --> 02:32:19.614]  They were the leading and ruling class.
[02:32:20.215 --> 02:32:22.496]  And they simply had business people below them and workers.
[02:32:23.237 --> 02:32:26.279]  And that's exactly what they're doing now on a global scale.
[02:32:26.819 --> 02:32:30.062]  That's why there's such contempt for people.
[02:32:30.802 --> 02:32:32.964]  Because people are seen simply as tools of labor.
[02:32:34.218 --> 02:32:42.523]  And there's, quite frankly, a lot of people, especially in the aristocracy, are saying, well, with computers coming in, we might not even need a lot of that labor.
[02:32:43.063 --> 02:32:45.804]  And that's why the communist terms are everywhere, Colonel.
[02:32:46.505 --> 02:32:48.206]  We're called human resources.
[02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:49.800]  Yes.
[02:32:51.342 --> 02:32:52.043]  Alex, yes.
[02:32:52.604 --> 02:32:59.973]  And that's why all of a sudden, out of nowhere, you had an HR expert and people were like, what exactly is HR?
[02:33:00.354 --> 02:33:01.976]  Human Resources.
[02:33:02.536 --> 02:33:04.359]  You mean sort of like plumbing parts?
[02:33:04.619 --> 02:33:04.919]  Yes.
[02:33:06.152 --> 02:33:12.535]  Sort of like, you know, and then all of a sudden people started thinking, this has got to be complicated.
[02:33:12.795 --> 02:33:19.798]  So one of the things that Greg very astutely said to me was, we got to explain this stuff to people.
[02:33:19.858 --> 02:33:24.300]  And I was like, oh, you mean the old PhD for the PFC?
[02:33:25.341 --> 02:33:30.423]  You know, what good is going to school and studying and doing all that stuff if you can't relate it to people?
[02:33:30.823 --> 02:33:32.544]  Well, two things that we know.
[02:33:33.761 --> 02:33:52.477]  One, this is a very risky endeavor for these people because as they transition into conventional operations, there's a high, high degree of certainty that if they don't run effective pacification operations on the people, the people will simply resist.
[02:33:53.478 --> 02:33:57.141]  And they will start saying things like this, Alex,
[02:33:58.334 --> 02:34:08.699]  I sent a letter to my elected leader, the man who gets a federal paycheck, and he is a public servant, meaning he's protecting the public's good.
[02:34:08.959 --> 02:34:11.960]  That means all of our tax money, all of our treasure.
[02:34:12.721 --> 02:34:13.961]  And he just doesn't respond.
[02:34:15.422 --> 02:34:16.883]  What can we do?
[02:34:16.903 --> 02:34:18.123]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[02:34:18.623 --> 02:34:26.427]  You mean to tell me that an elected or a key bureaucrat is refusing to answer?
[02:34:28.339 --> 02:34:30.303]  Well, we can't do anything.
[02:34:31.104 --> 02:34:31.485]  Really?
[02:34:31.505 --> 02:34:33.910]  Well, that's not exactly right, is it?
[02:34:34.191 --> 02:34:37.337]  Because we know that if you do not provide honest services...
[02:34:38.394 --> 02:35:00.487]  And in the process of not providing honest services, it's a coordinated effort to subvert government process, like investigations, or audits, or... And Colonel, let me give people briefly some hope here, and then bring in our other guest just briefly, because I want to get his take, because this is all... we have to have him back again, maybe for two hours commercial break, because there's so much to cover.
[02:35:02.296 --> 02:35:07.799]  Look at how DEI, with just lawsuits a few hundred getting filed around the country, is already shutting it down.
[02:35:07.859 --> 02:35:10.741]  It's already being abandoned by the big corporations.
[02:35:10.801 --> 02:35:13.342]  Government universities are still pushing it, but it's slowing.
[02:35:13.382 --> 02:35:15.243]  Wherever they get resistance, they fail.
[02:35:15.803 --> 02:35:19.826]  But when the Atacama can slither around you while you're asleep, then it can crush you.
[02:35:20.849 --> 02:35:24.833]  And so sure, it basically has one ring around us, but that's not enough to crush us.
[02:35:25.193 --> 02:35:26.615]  We can wrap around two more times.
[02:35:26.695 --> 02:35:27.275]  It's got us.
[02:35:27.595 --> 02:35:29.417]  We have to recognize the snakes are on our belly.
[02:35:29.757 --> 02:35:31.039]  We got to get it off of us.
[02:35:31.779 --> 02:35:36.944]  Right now, it politically starts stabbing it nonviolently and understand that they're doing this.
[02:35:36.984 --> 02:35:37.665]  Here's a microcosm.
[02:35:37.685 --> 02:35:40.507]  Remember when they sent the FBI out and turned it was a memo from the White House?
[02:35:40.948 --> 02:35:41.748]  They claimed it was organic.
[02:35:42.765 --> 02:35:56.368]  To send the FBI to threaten school boards in Virginia and Maryland and other states, saying you better not come protest all this race brainwashing and DEI and critical race theory and transgenderism.
[02:35:57.508 --> 02:36:04.830]  That's because they're so scared if we simply take over the ground level, running for office, getting on the boards, doing it, educating people.
[02:36:05.936 --> 02:36:06.516]  This is the moment
[02:36:35.447 --> 02:36:43.121]  Where Americans, probably for the first time in their lives, are going to have to stand up and just say no.
[02:36:44.043 --> 02:36:44.323]  No!
[02:36:44.724 --> 02:36:46.848]  If you are a federal official,
[02:36:48.027 --> 02:36:49.147]  It is against the law.
[02:36:49.207 --> 02:36:52.549]  It's a criminal offense to not perform your duties.
[02:36:53.049 --> 02:36:54.329]  It's not an administrative.
[02:36:54.850 --> 02:36:56.050]  It is a criminal offense.
[02:36:56.410 --> 02:37:07.094]  And if you work together to subvert government policy, and the policy of the government, right, is transparency and accountability, and you've collaborated together to do that?
[02:37:07.674 --> 02:37:08.315]  Oh my goodness.
[02:37:08.735 --> 02:37:10.255]  That's 18 U.S.C.
[02:37:10.275 --> 02:37:10.255]  1505.
[02:37:10.495 --> 02:37:14.457]  And look at how they all get caught using secret emails.
[02:37:14.497 --> 02:37:15.577]  That's a felony right there.
[02:37:16.518 --> 02:37:16.778]  Yes.
[02:37:17.816 --> 02:37:22.757]  But I think that, see, for me, this is like a celebration.
[02:37:23.498 --> 02:37:28.779]  This is Americans looking around and going, hey, it's time for us to jump up and fix it.
[02:37:29.279 --> 02:37:35.181]  And the beauty of this, in my mind, is our job is to give people confidence.
[02:37:36.461 --> 02:37:41.463]  Our job is to look and grab our neighbors, look around and say,
[02:37:42.981 --> 02:37:45.142]  We're going to keep what's ours.
[02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:57.291]  If you want to be a government official and you want to take the published treasure and you think you're not going to perform your duty, well, I think the Supreme Court is not agreeing.
[02:37:57.871 --> 02:37:59.352]  That's what the whole Chevron defense.
[02:38:00.132 --> 02:38:01.493]  That's why they clipped their wings.
[02:38:02.034 --> 02:38:12.661]  And when they terminate and force Congress to eliminate Section 11 of the IG Enhancement Act and say, no, there will be no sui generis
[02:38:13.341 --> 02:38:18.684]  There's a special cabal established in the executive branch that controls everyone.
[02:38:19.224 --> 02:38:32.970]  Once it's gone, America will begin the whole part and the most important piece for us, and that is celebrate our diversity, celebrate the fact that we're all different, but one thing we are, we're all Americans.
[02:38:33.851 --> 02:38:34.311]  That's right.
[02:38:34.431 --> 02:38:40.854]  Colonel, isn't the border another area to look at where it's total dereliction of duty, and in fact they're facilitating the smuggling of men, women, and children?
[02:38:41.716 --> 02:38:42.236]  Absolutely.
[02:38:42.276 --> 02:38:43.758]  It's an 18 U.S.C.
[02:38:44.178 --> 02:38:44.858]  1505 violation.
[02:38:45.599 --> 02:38:45.979]  Absolutely.
[02:38:45.999 --> 02:38:46.820]  It's a criminal offense.
[02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:51.483]  And this crime is against America.
[02:38:51.523 --> 02:38:52.984]  And people need to understand that.
[02:38:53.004 --> 02:38:53.464]  18 U.S.C.
[02:38:53.524 --> 02:38:53.745]  Sorry.
[02:38:53.765 --> 02:38:53.745]  1346.
[02:38:53.785 --> 02:38:59.288]  1346 is a scheme to defraud the people of their right, their intangible right, to honest services.
[02:39:12.321 --> 02:39:13.342]  It's a criminal offense!
[02:39:14.242 --> 02:39:25.451]  Now, the fact that you have the DOJ completely compromised, the fact that the public integrity section... Now, what we really need to do is what we're doing right now.
[02:39:26.371 --> 02:39:32.095]  Now, remember, when we look at this holistically, we have to think about it in a bigger picture.
[02:39:32.536 --> 02:39:34.657]  First, you have to understand the root cause of the problem.
[02:39:34.777 --> 02:39:35.178]  Well, we do.
[02:39:36.104 --> 02:39:50.455]  Progressive Social Reconstruction, the Long March through the institutions, and the fact that they've done infestation and procreation, and they are ideologically polarized, and it's inconsistent with the American form of government.
[02:39:50.795 --> 02:39:53.718]  Once we've done that, the rest is going to be, it's simple.
[02:39:54.218 --> 02:39:55.619]  It's not easy, but it's simple.
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:39:59.342]  So the next thing we have to do, we eliminate the Siggy.
[02:40:00.610 --> 02:40:07.780]  No, we don't have an unelected cabal of individuals who can decide who what will.
[02:40:08.201 --> 02:40:13.408]  What's important is, and what they don't understand is, in 2016 and 2017, we began working on this.
[02:40:17.717 --> 02:40:20.359]  And we understood exactly what we were saying.
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:38.416]  And we also understood that we would have to build evidentiary base, that's witness statements and documentation, necessary to substantiate allegations of wrongdoing that would be specifically leveled against key agency officials and the members of the CIGI.
[02:40:39.338 --> 02:40:53.849]  Now, when the American public has an opportunity to take a look at the documents and see what has happened, they will now understand why the wealth extraction system in America is running unfettered.
[02:40:54.189 --> 02:41:03.997]  Because every single public servant that has done their duty, and this is something the American public does not understand, the civil service
[02:41:05.154 --> 02:41:12.118]  Those people who have dedicated their lives to protect the Americans, their public good.
[02:41:12.778 --> 02:41:15.540]  These people are the targets.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:22.384]  Because they're the ones that are bringing forward all of this information and they're delivering it to the Inspectors General.
[02:41:24.165 --> 02:41:26.966]  And the Inspectors General are simply firing them.
[02:41:27.406 --> 02:41:31.849]  And we know there's a major problem because they go to Congress, which they have.
[02:41:32.569 --> 02:41:33.570]  We have hundreds
[02:41:34.967 --> 02:41:36.267]  Thousands, actually.
[02:41:36.668 --> 02:41:44.270]  And when they all get their day in court, and they're able to say, we, as a class of U.S.
[02:41:44.350 --> 02:41:59.114]  citizens, have been subjected to intimidation and coercion, organized to subvert the policy of the United States government, which is transparency and accountability, people are going to understand what that actually means.
[02:42:00.275 --> 02:42:01.295]  Because it has a definition.
[02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:04.011]  Absolutely.
[02:42:04.091 --> 02:42:04.832]  Colonel, stay right there.
[02:42:04.852 --> 02:42:05.793]  We're about to start the next hour.
[02:42:05.813 --> 02:42:10.117]  This has gone too quickly, but I'm going to post this on X. I got busy and didn't.
[02:42:10.137 --> 02:42:12.539]  I'm going to post it on Real Alex Jones during the break.
[02:42:12.719 --> 02:42:14.361]  The council, who's running the United States.
[02:42:14.741 --> 02:42:16.282]  You guys both have great websites.
[02:42:16.683 --> 02:42:17.463]  I've seen several of them.
[02:42:17.724 --> 02:42:21.627]  Where's the best place for everybody listening to go to get this document, to read it, and share it?
[02:42:23.649 --> 02:42:26.211]  The best place to go is the intelligencer.today.
[02:42:27.486 --> 02:42:30.087]  And do a quick search on intelligencer.today.
[02:42:30.107 --> 02:42:33.008]  It was published last July, in early July.
[02:42:33.028 --> 02:42:36.369]  You can also go to patriot.online.
[02:42:36.449 --> 02:42:38.110]  That's not .net or .com.
[02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:44.852]  It's www.patriot.online or patriot.online by itself.
[02:42:45.492 --> 02:42:46.372]  And scroll down.
[02:42:46.412 --> 02:42:50.534]  We have a number of different documents there, court cases, including this article.
[02:42:50.554 --> 02:42:51.574]  They'll be able to download it.
[02:42:52.134 --> 02:42:53.775]  So those are the places they can go.
[02:42:55.464 --> 02:42:57.744]  And they can also help support us with donations.
[02:42:57.764 --> 02:43:05.106]  There's a button there, and I have to say that we've given the last full measure here, and we could use some support.
[02:43:05.726 --> 02:43:06.546]  Oh, this is critical.
[02:43:06.586 --> 02:43:12.327]  It's like the Death Star plans, and now we've got to get them out to the X-Wings and politically destroy it in a nonviolent way.
[02:43:12.347 --> 02:43:14.488]  But I'm going to post it on X during the break.
[02:43:14.528 --> 02:43:18.629]  The council who is running the United States of America by the Intelligencer.today.
[02:43:20.572 --> 02:43:28.793]  We're gonna go to break here in about two and a half minutes, but Greg Stenstrom, I wanted you to just make some comments on what we've been talking about here.
[02:43:31.354 --> 02:43:49.737]  Well, it's a genuine pleasure to listen to the fluidity of Colonel Shindelar and his command of the topics and the ability to reach back into the dates and times and give the academic, truly the academic dichotomy of what we're facing here.
[02:43:50.754 --> 02:44:00.859]  But I noticed he mentioned one thing that was most important, is leaders have one primary job, and that is to give other people courage.
[02:44:01.699 --> 02:44:05.301]  More so than any one thing, it's to give other people courage.
[02:44:06.221 --> 02:44:17.727]  And what the Council most fears is President Trump, is because not only does he know who they are, he now has a much better understanding of who they are,
[02:44:18.456 --> 02:44:20.037]  And he gives other people courage.
[02:44:20.817 --> 02:44:23.059]  Timothy and myself coming on the show here today.
[02:44:23.079 --> 02:44:27.301]  I think I hope we give other people courage to do the same.
[02:44:27.461 --> 02:44:38.028]  We have hundreds of whistleblowers, hundreds of our peers, classmates, people who are ready to speak up, but they need to have a person they can speak up to.
[02:44:38.048 --> 02:44:41.930]  The one thing I'd like to go before we we only have a minute for the break.
[02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:43.031]  I'd like to come back.
[02:44:43.931 --> 02:44:54.133]  I really wanted to focus on the propaganda arm, because that propaganda arm is what has quashed honest journalism, and it's also quashed good people.
[02:44:54.873 --> 02:45:11.436]  And I want to focus on the next segment, if we could, and we only have a short time, is on Norm Eisen and the propaganda arm, and what has occurred over the last 10 years that is allowing them to shape our elections and the mindset of our republic.
[02:45:12.184 --> 02:45:13.722]  And what to expect in the election.
[02:45:14.469 --> 02:45:19.291]  And by educating people, giving them the power to resist and recognize.
[02:45:19.311 --> 02:45:19.731]  That's right.
[02:45:19.771 --> 02:45:20.672]  Greg Stenstrom, stay there.
[02:45:21.032 --> 02:45:24.654]  We'll have about 15-20 minutes in the next hour, but I want to invite you both up.
[02:45:24.954 --> 02:45:28.575]  If you can do it on a Saturday or even a weeknight, we're doing a DNC this week.
[02:45:29.095 --> 02:45:31.617]  We can come in here and do like an hour and a half, two hours commercial free.
[02:45:32.057 --> 02:45:43.482]  We can have all the documents in a row because exactly, you just hit the top of the pyramid earlier, Colonel, which is key to the top of the Inspector Generals, but then they've got their arms and everything in this council through this
[02:45:44.739 --> 02:45:49.761]  Law, the system passed by the legislature that is gobbling up the entire nation.
[02:45:50.101 --> 02:45:51.382]  They have similar programs worldwide.
[02:45:51.402 --> 02:45:51.862]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:52.823 --> 02:45:56.824]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:45:57.465 --> 02:45:59.626]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:45:59.646 --> 02:46:03.867]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:46:04.228 --> 02:46:06.289]  Because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:46:06.829 --> 02:46:11.471]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:46:12.151 --> 02:46:23.699]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:46:24.319 --> 02:46:33.105]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:46:33.525 --> 02:46:36.267]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products
[02:46:36.887 --> 02:46:42.669]  Are actually our famous products simply private labeled and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:46:42.989 --> 02:46:43.989]  They're all top of the line.
[02:46:44.029 --> 02:46:45.049]  They're already best sellers.
[02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:50.811]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names, but they are all the very best.
[02:46:51.291 --> 02:46:53.392]  So this line is called Info Wars MD.
[02:46:54.424 --> 02:46:56.147]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:46:56.507 --> 02:47:00.152]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:47:00.572 --> 02:47:03.496]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:47:03.636 --> 02:47:06.520]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:47:06.881 --> 02:47:08.763]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:47:08.783 --> 02:47:10.545]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[02:47:10.886 --> 02:47:12.388]  It is the exact same
[02:47:12.588 --> 02:47:12.868]  Thank you.
[02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:36.483]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:47:36.583 --> 02:47:37.785]  I need you to take action.
[02:47:38.085 --> 02:47:39.226]  You will love these products.
[02:47:39.466 --> 02:47:40.808]  They work really, really good.
[02:47:41.028 --> 02:47:51.038]  No matter which one you try, they're already top-of-the-line, tested, private-labeled by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[02:47:51.258 --> 02:47:52.039]  Thank you for your support.
[02:47:52.179 --> 02:47:55.301]  We got a big announcement at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:48:21.298 --> 02:48:24.659]  We've got something for everyone at the Infowars MD line.
[02:48:25.439 --> 02:48:27.360]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:29.621]  Just look into all the benefits of collagen, folks.
[02:48:29.641 --> 02:48:33.061]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.
[02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:34.782]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:48:35.502 --> 02:48:36.804]  Superfood greens.
[02:48:36.864 --> 02:48:37.685]  Are you getting the fiber?
[02:48:37.745 --> 02:48:39.166]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:48:39.687 --> 02:48:42.290]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:48:42.390 --> 02:48:43.411]  Superfood greens.
[02:48:43.851 --> 02:48:44.772]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:48:44.892 --> 02:48:47.315]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:48:47.355 --> 02:48:48.356]  You might not like eating them.
[02:48:48.396 --> 02:48:51.519]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:48:51.539 --> 02:48:53.562]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:48:55.083 --> 02:49:02.290]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:06.994]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:49:07.034 --> 02:49:10.438]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[02:49:10.738 --> 02:49:17.704]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:49:19.166 --> 02:49:20.187]  I noticed the difference.
[02:49:20.547 --> 02:49:21.348]  I noticed the difference.
[02:49:21.388 --> 02:49:22.249]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:49:22.269 --> 02:49:24.211]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:49:24.531 --> 02:49:26.553]  But that's why Tumeric is so important.
[02:49:26.593 --> 02:49:28.274]  Tumeric 95, 25% off.
[02:49:28.555 --> 02:49:30.036]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:49:30.156 --> 02:49:31.317]  The prostate support.
[02:49:31.758 --> 02:49:32.879]  Very important for men.
[02:49:33.379 --> 02:49:34.160]  Nerve Renew.
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:35.361]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:49:36.122 --> 02:49:37.123]  Both of those things are key.
[02:49:37.183 --> 02:49:38.264]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:49:38.464 --> 02:49:41.207]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:49:41.467 --> 02:49:42.147]  Good night's sleep.
[02:49:42.648 --> 02:49:48.413]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:48.493 --> 02:49:49.795]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:49:50.315 --> 02:49:52.097]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:49:52.517 --> 02:49:54.179]  Well, we're trying to save the Republic here.
[02:49:55.370 --> 02:49:57.051]  Greg Stenstrom is our guest.
[02:49:57.091 --> 02:49:59.472]  He's a Naval Officer, Special Warfare.
[02:50:00.132 --> 02:50:02.113]  Colonel Timothy Schindler, U.S.
[02:50:02.133 --> 02:50:11.397]  Marine Corps, I won't go over his great bio here, but became highly recommended by the Trump campaign to get these guys on because they've done a great analysis of this really
[02:50:12.057 --> 02:50:13.358]  Criminal takeover that's happened.
[02:50:13.819 --> 02:50:16.842]  And if you wonder how the Deep State works, here is the blueprints of the damn thing.
[02:50:17.503 --> 02:50:20.866]  So, Greg, some stations don't carry this segment, but they do carry the next one.
[02:50:21.527 --> 02:50:29.134]  And we'll do a deeper dive on this because their surveillance arm, which is then their censorship arm, is really the teeth of this thing.
[02:50:29.915 --> 02:50:34.680]  And so let's start getting into who is commanding this, and we'll name some names.
[02:50:36.365 --> 02:50:42.830]  Sure, we can bring it up further, but what I'd like to talk about is the propaganda arm specifically.
[02:50:43.651 --> 02:50:52.037]  The propaganda arm is critical to what they're doing and is what the propaganda arm is what they use to crush honest journalism.
[02:50:52.858 --> 02:51:00.404]  And it's been what is quashed Fox News, removed Tucker Carlson from Fox News, Emerald Robinson from Newsmax.
[02:51:01.345 --> 02:51:05.688]  They've certainly bracketed you and attacked you as a conspiracy theorist versus
[02:51:06.317 --> 02:51:08.058]  Someone who presents honest journalism.
[02:51:08.078 --> 02:51:09.739]  They've gone after Roger Stone.
[02:51:10.299 --> 02:51:14.722]  Just about anybody who can provide truthful, honest news.
[02:51:14.782 --> 02:51:15.702]  It would take hours.
[02:51:15.742 --> 02:51:17.123]  They've attacked millions of people.
[02:51:18.103 --> 02:51:18.303]  Right.
[02:51:18.844 --> 02:51:27.188]  But I want to, if the control room there can bring up the propaganda arm on the screen, I want to highlight someone here.
[02:51:27.228 --> 02:51:28.549]  His name is Norm Eisenberg.
[02:51:29.739 --> 02:51:33.964]  And I want to just briefly discuss what's happened here in the propaganda arm.
[02:51:34.925 --> 02:51:38.550]  And knowing that we have another segment, I'd like to talk a little bit about elections.
[02:51:38.650 --> 02:51:44.457]  But can the control room bring up Norm Eisen, the picture of him as the special counsel?
[02:51:44.497 --> 02:51:45.819]  Yes, we'll bring up the special counsel.
[02:51:45.839 --> 02:51:46.560]  Start describing him.
[02:51:47.803 --> 02:51:52.504]  Norm Eisen was a peer of Obama.
[02:51:52.744 --> 02:51:54.705]  That's further down in the propaganda arm.
[02:51:55.165 --> 02:51:59.646]  But he is a Harvard Law School graduate with President Obama.
[02:52:00.547 --> 02:52:04.688]  And he has been a lifelong peer of Obama.
[02:52:04.868 --> 02:52:15.611]  And he is, I'm going to say, deranged in terms of his feelings towards the American Republic, towards President Trump.
[02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:28.507]  Uh, he was written a book called Ending Trumpery, but he was injected into the council in multiple roles, which Tim has been describing for the better part of the past hour.
[02:52:29.227 --> 02:52:30.408]  But the
[02:52:31.476 --> 02:52:33.698]  The media arm is Norm Eisen.
[02:52:34.418 --> 02:52:44.565]  And one of the things that happened here that's enabled this is in 2015, actually in 2012, they had the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act.
[02:52:45.325 --> 02:52:57.754]  And then in 2015, Obama signed Executive Order 13707, which was using behavioral science insights to better serve the American people.
[02:52:58.490 --> 02:53:02.932]  And what they did is they reversed the Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948.
[02:53:03.072 --> 02:53:09.695]  And it's really technical, but the bottom line is they said the government can now put out propaganda.
[02:53:11.076 --> 02:53:16.478]  They reversed an act dating back to 1948 that did not allow propaganda.
[02:53:17.350 --> 02:53:26.877]  And now in the 2012 to 2015 and up to the current day, they have codified and made it lawful to lie to the American public.
[02:53:26.917 --> 02:53:29.839]  And what you see on that screen is liar number one.
[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:34.522]  In the circles that he works in, he's known as the rabbi.
[02:53:34.602 --> 02:53:43.829]  That is not a denigrative to the faith, but indicative of his methodology and his obsession with lies.
[02:53:44.577 --> 02:53:51.281]  Through him, the media is controlled and people are denigrated, isolated, contained, destroyed.
[02:53:51.301 --> 02:54:01.387]  He will attack anyone who is going to oppose the council, the extraction of wealth, and their control over this country.
[02:54:02.027 --> 02:54:10.752]  So I know we've only got, we're going into the next segment here, we've only got 30 seconds I think, and we can come back on the live show and talk more about that and the elections.
[02:54:12.748 --> 02:54:21.854]  And again, we'll do more broadcast on this, and we'll do a whole show where you'll just send us stuff in chronological order, Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, Exhibit 4, and we'll be able to lay this out.
[02:54:21.874 --> 02:54:27.658]  People should just go, read the report for themselves, and they'll be able to see it, and everything right there.
[02:54:27.698 --> 02:54:30.640]  But this is, couldn't be more important information.
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:38.665]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host, and fullhorse.com forward slash show man dot video, and real Alex Jones on X. We're exposing the council.
[02:54:38.725 --> 02:54:40.346]  Who is really running the United States?
[02:54:40.366 --> 02:54:41.007]  We've only covered
[02:54:41.943 --> 02:54:52.048]  The tip of it, these inspector generals in the act in the late 70s, Greg Stenstrom, one of the researchers here on this, along with our other guest, Colonel Timothy Schindler.
[02:54:53.029 --> 02:54:58.151]  And you were getting into the propaganda arm and describing the individual.
[02:54:58.191 --> 02:54:59.452]  Please recap that and continue.
[02:55:01.113 --> 02:55:08.676]  Just to recap for the for the show, the propaganda arm is going to be incredibly important to the upcoming election.
[02:55:10.629 --> 02:55:22.923]  The council, which has been described by Colonel Shindelar, Dr. Shindelar, for the better part of the fast hour, he has laid out their codification, the fact that they're a real organization.
[02:55:23.343 --> 02:55:30.652]  But they have a thing called a propaganda arm, and the, I'm going to call it liar number one, is Norm Eisen.
[02:55:31.482 --> 02:55:39.245]  He was classmates with Obama at Harvard, and he has been injected by Obama into the council.
[02:55:39.285 --> 02:55:43.987]  The council is basically using him as the propaganda arm.
[02:55:45.100 --> 02:55:53.942]  In between 2012 and 2015, they reversed the Smith-Munth Act, or they called it the Smith-Munth Modernization Act.
[02:55:54.503 --> 02:56:05.966]  They used an executive order and they repealed part of the 1948 Act, which now allows propaganda to be inflicted on the United States citizenry.
[02:56:06.686 --> 02:56:14.208]  And the reason this is important to this conversation today and the dissection of the Council is
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.383]  We need to know who our enemies are and who the enemies of our country are.
[02:56:19.244 --> 02:56:36.818]  And, you know, we have to name names, name their organizations, show their photographs, describe their criminal acts, and call them out so that other people, not just us, can act on remedying and removing these people and, quite frankly, bringing them to justice.
[02:56:37.018 --> 02:56:37.498]  Well, that's right.
[02:56:37.538 --> 02:56:38.880]  And, Colonel, you had mentioned
[02:56:41.479 --> 02:56:48.065]  You know, Raskin and all these other people, I mean, and his father being the big communist that engineered this current model.
[02:56:48.125 --> 02:56:53.250]  I mean, this is a bureaucracy that's literally handing down its power.
[02:56:53.310 --> 02:56:57.193]  And then we've got Raskin running around on TV saying, we're going to have civil war.
[02:56:57.213 --> 02:56:58.354]  We're not going to accept Trump.
[02:56:58.775 --> 02:56:59.976]  We're going to arrest our enemies.
[02:56:59.996 --> 02:57:03.519]  But then separately, they're accusing Trump of planning to round everybody up.
[02:57:03.759 --> 02:57:04.560]  What's going on there?
[02:57:05.961 --> 02:57:07.923]  That's called mirror image.
[02:57:08.846 --> 02:57:20.769]  And one of the advantages of mirror image is if I'm maybe not as strong as I need to be, I simply present you with this picture and I'm after belief.
[02:57:21.470 --> 02:57:24.790]  Belief is strong emotional attachment to a mental proposition.
[02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:26.211]  That's how we teach it.
[02:57:26.951 --> 02:57:30.792]  So if I can get you to believe something, it doesn't mean it's true.
[02:57:30.812 --> 02:57:32.533]  It doesn't mean it's false.
[02:57:32.553 --> 02:57:33.853]  It actually has nothing to do with it.
[02:57:34.013 --> 02:57:35.093]  It's about perception.
[02:57:35.493 --> 02:57:37.014]  What you perceive
[02:57:37.952 --> 02:57:40.213]  Because I'm after trying to get your behavior.
[02:57:40.233 --> 02:57:42.414]  And that is exactly what we're seeing here.
[02:57:43.115 --> 02:57:46.617]  So he is laying out the threat pattern.
[02:57:47.217 --> 02:57:48.698]  This is what we're going to do.
[02:57:49.598 --> 02:57:56.482]  And the beauty of this, if you were to look at this like a novel, you know, like a layout novel, these are the two snakes.
[02:57:57.378 --> 02:58:01.700]  And they're climbing up the pole and they're seeing which snake will get to the top first.
[02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:05.382]  And the one who gets to the top first is going to devour the other snake.
[02:58:05.842 --> 02:58:07.443]  This has nothing to do with violence.
[02:58:08.123 --> 02:58:15.967]  Quite frankly, just as they learned when they did the Port Huron statement, violence has nothing to do with this.
[02:58:17.228 --> 02:58:18.288]  Violence is rude.
[02:58:18.328 --> 02:58:18.968]  It's crude.
[02:58:19.209 --> 02:58:20.269]  It's unnecessary.
[02:58:20.689 --> 02:58:24.111]  Because once I control the administrative arms of power,
[02:58:25.049 --> 02:58:25.529]  The bank?
[02:58:25.649 --> 02:58:26.610]  I own everything.
[02:58:27.471 --> 02:58:28.712]  There's no reason to do that.
[02:58:29.272 --> 02:58:33.995]  But if I can hide in plain sight, I'll be okay.
[02:58:34.376 --> 02:58:35.396]  That's what's going on here.
[02:58:35.456 --> 02:58:36.077]  They're scared.
[02:58:36.437 --> 02:58:37.478]  And they should be scared.
[02:58:37.838 --> 02:58:46.084]  Because if the American public understands what is going on and says, wait a minute, you can't do this.
[02:58:46.104 --> 02:58:47.525]  You're just a public servant.
[02:58:48.726 --> 02:58:50.807]  You're an unelected bureaucrat.
[02:58:51.148 --> 02:58:53.109]  You don't have the power to do this.
[02:58:53.689 --> 02:58:53.929]  No.
[02:58:55.371 --> 02:58:57.752]  When I send you a letter, you will answer the mail.
[02:58:58.073 --> 02:58:59.013]  It's your job.
[02:58:59.354 --> 02:59:15.166]  As a matter of fact, if, God forbid, if you are working with someone else and it is a collusionary action, because that is a criminal offense, but then I guess we would need to have a Department of Justice that was interested in justice.
[02:59:15.706 --> 02:59:19.969]  And as you point out in the report, that's another big part of the council.
[02:59:20.009 --> 02:59:22.591]  You go through all the different divisions in the report.
[02:59:22.671 --> 02:59:26.093]  How many, from your research, how many divisions of the council are there?
[02:59:26.113 --> 02:59:28.935]  And then how do they have sub-councils regionally and locally, don't they?
[02:59:30.933 --> 02:59:32.674]  The best way to look at it is like this.
[02:59:32.935 --> 02:59:34.116]  There are 94 U.S.
[02:59:34.156 --> 02:59:38.599]  attorneys across the country, and they are naturally aligned with all of the courts.
[02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:47.926]  And they reflect, and they will prosecute or not prosecute whatever they're told to prosecute or not prosecute.
[02:59:48.367 --> 02:59:59.956]  If they are ideologically polarized, in other words, they're making their decisions upon an ideological belief, and it isn't based upon their individual oath
[03:00:00.868 --> 03:00:01.849]  To the Constitution.
[03:00:01.929 --> 03:00:02.809]  Not an individual.
[03:00:03.530 --> 03:00:05.171]  To the Constitution of the United States.
[03:00:05.952 --> 03:00:11.035]  If they don't do their duty, they should be administratively removed.
[03:00:11.475 --> 03:00:15.698]  And if they are criminally complicit, they should be tried.
[03:00:16.679 --> 03:00:18.721]  And that's essentially what we're dealing with.
[03:00:19.161 --> 03:00:24.745]  If I were a co-opted public servant, I would be worried.
[03:00:25.605 --> 03:00:27.667]  Because if they do not win,
[03:00:29.249 --> 03:00:30.089]  They lose everything.
[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:33.431]  They will be held accountable.
[03:00:34.172 --> 03:00:39.034]  And another thing that the American public should get used to is this.
[03:00:39.054 --> 03:00:40.835]  42 U.S.C., U.S.
[03:00:40.915 --> 03:00:42.096]  Code, 42 U.S.
[03:00:42.156 --> 03:00:43.777]  Code 1983.
[03:00:44.137 --> 03:00:50.741]  That's important because that's the ability to hold the individual accountable for their actions.
[03:00:52.042 --> 03:00:52.582]  That's right.
[03:00:52.902 --> 03:01:06.406]  When you're a public servant and you take an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, you are the vanguard that protects our country.
[03:01:07.287 --> 03:01:14.869]  But if you're ideologically polarized and you believe in something other than our country, you shouldn't be in the federal government.
[03:01:16.169 --> 03:01:18.770]  And that's what we're dealing with right now.
[03:01:19.410 --> 03:01:21.311]  So if they are unsuccessful,
[03:01:22.426 --> 03:01:26.972]  In completing this bloodless coup, there will be accountability.
[03:01:27.593 --> 03:01:35.784]  And one of the things we need to make sure that we get across is, when we saw what was happening to Greg in the state of Pennsylvania,
[03:01:36.755 --> 03:01:51.907]  We looked down and we saw this and we said, wow, you know, we've been collecting hundreds of whistleblowers, building all the cases, names, times, dates, talked to the senators, the congressmen, talked to the members of the DOJ, the FBI, the U.S.
[03:01:51.967 --> 03:01:52.788]  attorneys.
[03:01:53.369 --> 03:01:56.591]  And I literally mean that as in U.S.
[03:01:56.631 --> 03:01:57.712]  attorney blank.
[03:01:58.112 --> 03:02:00.054]  Your job is to do this.
[03:02:00.134 --> 03:02:01.195]  You have not done that.
[03:02:01.575 --> 03:02:02.176]  It's a crime.
[03:02:02.256 --> 03:02:03.557]  You need to do your duty.
[03:02:04.332 --> 03:02:12.839]  Well, we understood in 17 and 18 that there was literally an organized effort to obstruct the government.
[03:02:12.879 --> 03:02:14.380]  Well, Colonel, let me tell you a quick story.
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:15.781]  This is just one of many.
[03:02:16.722 --> 03:02:25.549]  About a year ago, we get contacted by a federal agent who has a nice background, good record.
[03:02:26.049 --> 03:02:28.732]  He says, I'd like you to meet with a federal judge.
[03:02:29.870 --> 03:02:32.432]  We did it over Zoom one morning here for about an hour.
[03:02:33.473 --> 03:02:42.680]  And there was the top federal judge in a certain area, I'm just going to say top federal judge, and she really wasn't even trying to hide it or anything.
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:44.402]  She was saying, look, everything I'm giving you is public.
[03:02:44.442 --> 03:02:45.343]  Here's all the cases.
[03:02:46.083 --> 03:02:48.425]  And we need you to get this to Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson.
[03:02:48.465 --> 03:02:50.226]  And about a week later, some of it did go out on Fox.
[03:02:51.067 --> 03:03:01.710]  But she was telling me, and they were telling me, where they would catch, say, a four-time convicted child molester back from Mexico driving a school bus for mentally handicapped kids in South Texas, and they arrest him.
[03:03:02.391 --> 03:03:08.152]  And the Justice Department had the power to tell the federal judge or the magistrates under her, you cannot prosecute.
[03:03:08.272 --> 03:03:13.174]  In the statutory law, they could hold him for like a month, I think they said, because they were illegal crosser, but that was it.
[03:03:14.034 --> 03:03:15.395]  And they said they do this everywhere.
[03:03:15.495 --> 03:03:18.198]  They do not let us prosecute child traffickers, you name it.
[03:03:18.538 --> 03:03:20.840]  And I have, I mean this is like the head federal judge.
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:21.701]  I'm giving away who it is.
[03:03:21.761 --> 03:03:25.504]  I mean the point is, I'm sure they know, the point is head federal judge.
[03:03:26.005 --> 03:03:34.913]  So they're that frustrated by what's going on and so they're afraid the judiciary that's not perfect but has some good people might stand up to the bureaucracy
[03:03:35.313 --> 03:03:37.834]  So that's why they want the inspector generals to come in and take over.
[03:03:38.014 --> 03:03:49.541]  But that's just one of many conversations I have with the federal agents and with the judges that themselves are asking me what to do and then they're giving me advice and I mean it's just it's flabbergasting.
[03:03:50.701 --> 03:03:59.586]  The reason that we're here, let's be honest, is to provide the answers to the questions.
[03:04:01.164 --> 03:04:01.525]  That's it.
[03:04:01.625 --> 03:04:03.827]  I'm supposed to answer the questions.
[03:04:04.688 --> 03:04:05.789]  Somebody's doing something.
[03:04:05.849 --> 03:04:06.730]  Tell me what they're doing.
[03:04:06.991 --> 03:04:07.832]  Well, this is what they're doing.
[03:04:08.392 --> 03:04:17.343]  Now, whether you like it or whether you dislike it or whether you're going to stand up and do something, I can't do that.
[03:04:17.423 --> 03:04:18.764]  I'm no longer in the military.
[03:04:18.804 --> 03:04:20.767]  There was a time that that's what I did for a living.
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:23.321]  Colonel, we're out of time.
[03:04:23.961 --> 03:04:24.802]  Greg, we're out of time.
[03:04:24.862 --> 03:04:31.465]  Both of you, please come back soon, and we'll drill into other aspects and sectors of this and talk about solutions.
[03:04:31.885 --> 03:04:33.246]  Patriot.online.
[03:04:33.266 --> 03:04:36.588]  I've also posted on Accenture, Alex Jones, the report, the council.
[03:04:37.248 --> 03:04:39.029]  Greg Stenstrom, thank you so much.
[03:04:39.089 --> 03:04:40.249]  Patriot.online.
[03:04:40.329 --> 03:04:42.230]  Colonel Timothy Schindler, amazing.
[03:04:42.270 --> 03:04:43.471]  Thank you so much, both of you.
[03:04:43.991 --> 03:04:47.773]  Colonel, if anybody else wants to talk to you or interview or give you info, how do they contact you?
[03:04:49.474 --> 03:04:50.875]  Well, what we would like to do
[03:04:52.199 --> 03:05:02.748]  Alex is we want to build the team that we're going to need now so that we can effectively influence across all 50 states.
[03:05:03.388 --> 03:05:06.571]  Once Trump wins, it's going to be a battle.
[03:05:06.791 --> 03:05:10.975]  It isn't going to be something simple, but he's going to have to successfully govern.
[03:05:12.196 --> 03:05:16.099]  And in his first 20 days, he's going to do something that this nation has never seen.
[03:05:17.236 --> 03:05:18.799]  It's not going to be a 100-day plan.
[03:05:18.839 --> 03:05:20.122]  It's going to be a 20-day plan.
[03:05:20.864 --> 03:05:26.075]  And he is going to bring the seismic changes that we need to right the ship.
[03:05:28.937 --> 03:05:29.357]  We're good to go.
[03:05:48.476 --> 03:05:48.676]  Yeah.
[03:05:48.856 --> 03:05:50.137]  All right, gentlemen, we're out of time.
[03:05:50.237 --> 03:05:50.778]  We're out of time.
[03:05:50.838 --> 03:05:51.519]  I apologize.
[03:05:51.759 --> 03:05:53.220]  I've got a guest host set to come in here.
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:55.802]  You guys let my producers know when you come back home.
[03:05:55.822 --> 03:06:01.166]  We'll do part three and we'll drill into solutions and why they're so scared of Trump getting back in.
[03:06:01.547 --> 03:06:04.509]  And I guess the best place to go is Patriot.online to contact you guys.
[03:06:05.470 --> 03:06:05.710]  Yes.
[03:06:06.831 --> 03:06:07.071]  All right.
[03:06:07.111 --> 03:06:07.972]  Thank you so much for your work.
[03:06:08.012 --> 03:06:08.753]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:06:10.509 --> 03:06:11.589]  Now folks, it's up to you.
[03:06:12.350 --> 03:06:13.550]  This live part's over.
[03:06:13.891 --> 03:06:21.954]  We'll continue to be live for the rest of the hour, then no one takes over at 3 o'clock, but it's up to you now when this is posted on X and Bandot Video to share it, have it go viral.
[03:06:22.014 --> 03:06:22.974]  It's an information war.
[03:06:23.255 --> 03:06:28.357]  Here's a quick, very important report from John Bowne on this very subject, and then Maria Z's coming in.
[03:06:28.377 --> 03:06:31.838]  I'm inviting her on my show before she goes back to Australia here in the next few days.
[03:06:33.679 --> 03:06:35.220]  Maria Z is coming up, so stay with us.
[03:06:42.535 --> 03:06:45.056]  Kamala Harris committed to strengthening legal immigration.
[03:06:45.317 --> 03:06:50.580]  Some have accused DHS of not enforcing our nation's laws.
[03:06:51.721 --> 03:06:54.364]  This could not be further from the truth.
[03:06:55.204 --> 03:07:05.614]  The majority of all migrants encountered at the southwest border throughout this administration have been removed, returned, or expelled.
[03:07:05.954 --> 03:07:06.955]  A majority of them.
[03:07:07.276 --> 03:07:15.624]  We are doing everything we can within a broken system to incentivize non-citizens to use lawful pathways.
[03:07:16.324 --> 03:07:22.872]  To impose consequences on those who do not and to reduce irregular migration.
[03:07:23.493 --> 03:07:29.460]  Mexican soldiers supervise migration route as illegals rush U.S.
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:29.841]  border.
[03:07:29.861 --> 03:07:34.606]  One of the huge caravans that crossed to Eagle Pass in the last days of December.
[03:07:35.587 --> 03:07:42.529]  The migrants showed us the GPS they obtained when leaving a shelter to find a distant location on the Rio Grande.
[03:07:42.689 --> 03:07:43.470]  Our own military.
[03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:45.090]  I mean, you see it all over the internet.
[03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:46.751]  Oh, we're going to put the military on the border.
[03:07:47.111 --> 03:07:48.111]  I'm going to explain it again.
[03:07:48.471 --> 03:07:49.071]  We've been there.
[03:07:49.111 --> 03:07:49.891]  We've shot the video.
[03:07:49.911 --> 03:07:50.572]  It's all over the news.
[03:07:50.912 --> 03:07:51.692]  The U.S.
[03:07:51.792 --> 03:07:57.914]  military is down there facilitating and running the open border and cutting down barbed wire that
[03:07:58.829 --> 03:08:00.971]  The Texas Guard put up and the state police put up.
[03:08:01.171 --> 03:08:09.379]  Does the Biden White House have any intention to tackle this crisis in any meaningful way in the lead up to the 2024 election?
[03:08:09.679 --> 03:08:21.330]  No, on the contrary, they are suing Ken Paxton, Greg Abbott and the state of Texas for Texas's attempts to put some buoys in the Rio Grande trying to secure Texas's territorial sovereignty against
[03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:29.613]  The Mexican drug cartels and, frankly, Hezbollah and some radical Islamic groups that control large swaths, operationally speaking, of the U.S.-Mexico border.
[03:08:29.653 --> 03:08:35.434]  So they're actually, not only are they not trying to mitigate the damage, they're actually throwing fuel right into the fire, trying to make it worse.
[03:08:35.794 --> 03:08:37.615]  So let's just get that straight.
[03:08:38.175 --> 03:08:40.456]  Oh, there's liberal groups down there.
[03:08:41.216 --> 03:08:41.857]  Running things?
[03:08:42.077 --> 03:08:43.238]  Yeah, you think so?
[03:08:43.818 --> 03:08:46.059]  NGOs, non-governmental organizations.
[03:08:46.259 --> 03:08:50.842]  A group from Venezuela showed up on the doorstep here at the Red Cross recently.
[03:08:51.263 --> 03:08:57.607]  No one knew they were coming, and they claim they were given the address here by agents with the Border Patrol.
[03:08:58.087 --> 03:09:03.009]  Immigrant aid agencies were contacted and helped them find a place to live.
[03:09:03.209 --> 03:09:06.691]  We talked to these asylum seekers who just got off the train.
[03:09:07.411 --> 03:09:13.253]  Everyone had heard that the United States is giving them a direct pass to cross the border.
[03:09:13.813 --> 03:09:14.894]  What happens now?
[03:09:15.746 --> 03:09:29.834]  If you're talking about all these different people that have penetrated, all these different intelligence operatives, sleeper cells that have penetrated our southern border, what are the kind of extortion points, the pressure points that are used from within?
[03:09:29.934 --> 03:09:34.317]  We all know why the Democrats hang their hat on ignoring the word illegal.
[03:09:34.477 --> 03:09:39.800]  Because they have no qualms about doing whatever it takes to further their growing socialist cause.
[03:09:40.060 --> 03:09:42.721]  Even if those actions are illegal.
[03:09:43.041 --> 03:09:46.102]  And just how many illegal aliens are in the United States?
[03:09:46.322 --> 03:09:53.503]  Pew Research would have us believe 11.5 million, while a new Ivy League study doubles that number according to Breitbart.
[03:09:53.623 --> 03:10:04.146]  The population of illegal immigrants is roughly 22 million, or twice the establishment estimate of 11 million, say, three professors from Yale University
[03:10:04.506 --> 03:10:07.128]  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:14.635]  But you have to account for the illegal aliens that remain in the shadows after decades of unchecked border crossings.
[03:10:15.015 --> 03:10:22.181]  And if you allow something illegal to go on long enough, the reason for the established laws becomes more apparent.
[03:10:22.442 --> 03:10:30.849]  The Washington Examiner reported nearly half of the residents in the nation's five biggest cities do not speak English at home, choosing instead their native language.
[03:10:31.189 --> 03:10:41.992]  According to the latest Census Bureau data that details the impact of a decade of soft immigration policy, overall a record 67 million do not speak English at home.
[03:10:42.313 --> 03:10:45.073]  That has nearly doubled in 27 years.
[03:10:45.113 --> 03:10:49.275]  But I'm talking about the top people in the country who are willing to talk about immigration.
[03:10:49.295 --> 03:10:52.916]  The issue is just sitting there on the ground waiting for somebody to pick it up.
[03:10:53.236 --> 03:10:55.977]  Unfortunately, most of the black political leaders
[03:10:56.499 --> 03:10:59.860]  That have a platform are actually politicians.
[03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:02.921]  Now, I'm from a non-profit.
[03:11:03.421 --> 03:11:05.122]  You know, we don't endorse anyone.
[03:11:05.522 --> 03:11:13.165]  But I think that, you know, they go along with whatever the prevailing issue that will keep them in their positions.
[03:11:13.925 --> 03:11:16.406]  But there are people who want to speak up.
[03:11:17.266 --> 03:11:18.347]  I have many of them.
[03:11:19.347 --> 03:11:25.229]  We just have to have people who are brave enough to be able to allow their voices to be heard.
[03:11:26.104 --> 03:11:28.186]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[03:11:28.887 --> 03:11:30.868]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:30.968 --> 03:11:53.388]  I'm your guest host Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com and I have a very very important guest coming up in just a moment to talk to us about the smart city weapons systems that are being deployed across the UK, Australia and certainly I would say in the US and I witnessed some of that last year when I was here in Florida with all of the
[03:11:53.948 --> 03:11:55.029]  Streets being purple.
[03:11:55.089 --> 03:12:03.793]  But before I bring our guest Mark Steele on, I just want to talk to you briefly about why this topic matters today.
[03:12:04.373 --> 03:12:09.096]  This article, as you've seen, if you've been watching since the morning, Chase spoke about it.
[03:12:09.216 --> 03:12:10.196]  Alex spoke about it.
[03:12:10.256 --> 03:12:17.340]  The Biden administration rushes digital ID plans that was just posted on InfoWars this morning.
[03:12:17.500 --> 03:12:19.901]  And let me tell you that this is absolutely devastating.
[03:12:19.941 --> 03:12:21.242]  I've been warning for some time.
[03:12:21.942 --> 03:12:22.463]  I don't know.
[03:12:36.992 --> 03:12:37.393]  I don't know.
[03:12:59.954 --> 03:13:01.995]  Or at least an ID that links you to one.
[03:13:02.035 --> 03:13:11.518]  And although we may not be seeing the evidence of that just yet, you only need to look to countries like China to see how digital ID is weaponized against the populations.
[03:13:11.599 --> 03:13:15.420]  And this does relate to the smart city conversation that we're going to be having today.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:20.222]  But I want to briefly show you from this man's ex post.
[03:13:20.982 --> 03:13:24.284]  Australia just passed its digital ID bill into law.
[03:13:24.864 --> 03:13:29.746]  I'm Australian but I live in Iceland, a country that already has an all-encompassing digital ID system.
[03:13:30.386 --> 03:13:35.049]  And he says, if you're wondering how this is going to look, I'll tell you here now, just replace Australia with America.
[03:13:36.329 --> 03:13:36.730]  So, he says
[03:13:52.148 --> 03:14:07.958]  Phone services, accounting, tax, insurance, credit score, manage my assets, meaning car or house, power bill, medical record, when I vote or even want to pull up a store receipt of something I've bought, it's all linked to my digital ID.
[03:14:08.118 --> 03:14:09.079]  Everything in one place.
[03:14:09.239 --> 03:14:09.599]  Everything.
[03:14:09.619 --> 03:14:15.944]  And of course that opens you up to penalisation if you purchase things that aren't considered net zero.
[03:14:17.004 --> 03:14:27.553]  He says you can't even get power turned on, get a phone number, buy or register a car, rent or buy a house or even buy certain items without having a digital ID.
[03:14:27.974 --> 03:14:29.895]  He says it does have some benefits of course.
[03:14:31.257 --> 03:14:33.659]  When you try to do something it's more streamlined.
[03:14:34.139 --> 03:14:35.981]  That's if you trust the government with your data.
[03:14:36.942 --> 03:14:39.344]  But he says anyone can look up where he lives.
[03:14:40.584 --> 03:14:43.366]  The license plate of his car, how much tax he paid last year.
[03:14:43.386 --> 03:14:48.690]  There is absolutely no privacy at all in Iceland.
[03:14:49.290 --> 03:15:07.181]  Now, to pair with that absolute dystopia where everything that you do is on display at all times, every single movement, everything is tracked and monitored and you cannot function in society without this digital ID, which by the way, initially won't issue you a negative social credit score.
[03:15:07.221 --> 03:15:07.862]  That comes later.
[03:15:08.919 --> 03:15:09.739]  That comes later.
[03:15:10.679 --> 03:15:18.601]  Apart from all of that, you have the smart city infrastructure that is going to track and trace every single breath.
[03:15:18.781 --> 03:15:27.803]  And that is what my guest today is going to talk to us about, not just the tracking and tracing, but the weapons that are being deployed in these smart cities.
[03:15:27.863 --> 03:15:34.084]  Mark Steele is a weapons expert, and he's also been exposing the weapons systems that are being deployed in smart cities.
[03:15:34.144 --> 03:15:35.025]  Mark Steele, welcome.
[03:15:35.065 --> 03:15:36.545]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:15:38.843 --> 03:15:40.043]  Thanks for having me, Maria.
[03:15:40.484 --> 03:15:41.604]  It's really good to be here.
[03:15:41.984 --> 03:15:42.524]  Absolutely.
[03:15:42.564 --> 03:15:43.445]  It's wonderful to have you.
[03:15:43.465 --> 03:15:53.188]  Well, we're going to break in a moment, Mark, but you and I have spoken several times about the C40 Cities Network, the weapons systems.
[03:15:53.748 --> 03:16:01.091]  You are, in fact, in touch with Blade Runners yourself over there, who are pulling down these weapons systems and the team's got
[03:16:01.451 --> 03:16:17.038]  Some of those clips, which you can just play as we're talking, pulling down these weapons systems without consequence, by the way, because if they were to try and prosecute these people, they would actually expose in court that these are weapons systems.
[03:16:17.099 --> 03:16:20.180]  And so this is what you revealed to me the last time that we spoke, Mark.
[03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:23.562]  But today we're going to actually look at Unix traffic.
[03:16:23.942 --> 03:16:30.345]  We're going to look at some of their stated policies, this fusion technology, and also the Microsoft Azure
[03:16:30.885 --> 03:16:31.385]  System.
[03:16:32.106 --> 03:16:35.207]  Mark, you've recently been experiencing censorship.
[03:16:35.227 --> 03:16:36.907]  We've got about 30 seconds to break.
[03:16:37.268 --> 03:16:38.448]  Am I reading this right?
[03:16:38.548 --> 03:16:43.710]  I'm seeing barely any likes or comments on your sub stack, which is not typical of your sub stack.
[03:16:43.730 --> 03:16:45.531]  You normally get quite a lot of people looking.
[03:16:47.432 --> 03:16:50.434]  Yes, we get lots and lots of censorship now.
[03:16:50.674 --> 03:16:58.658]  The digital platform that do not want people to get or to understand what 15-minute cities really are about.
[03:16:59.119 --> 03:17:06.182]  They don't want people to know that the social credit score is actually a way to control because they... Stay there, Mark.
[03:17:06.222 --> 03:17:09.204]  We're going to dive into all this right after the break.
[03:17:09.244 --> 03:17:09.824]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:17:09.864 --> 03:17:10.585]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:11.405 --> 03:17:16.108]  An InfoWars fan favourite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[03:17:16.827 --> 03:17:19.210]  It is the vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[03:17:19.751 --> 03:17:25.558]  Now this is a copy of Linus Pauling who won the Nobel Prize for his findings of vitamin C's formula.
[03:17:26.139 --> 03:17:33.748]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and rose hips.
[03:17:34.248 --> 03:17:50.661]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[03:18:10.991 --> 03:18:11.551]  Welcome back.
[03:18:11.611 --> 03:18:15.153]  We are here with weapons expert Mark Steele.
[03:18:15.373 --> 03:18:26.376]  Just before the break, Mark, you were talking about the censorship that you're facing and the fact that they don't want the world to know about the C40 cities and the fact that these weapons systems are being deployed all over the world.
[03:18:26.476 --> 03:18:27.937]  Please continue with your point, Mark.
[03:18:30.157 --> 03:18:33.859]  The equipment is extremely dangerous.
[03:18:33.999 --> 03:18:38.440]  We've got multiple laser diode type equipment.
[03:18:38.961 --> 03:18:41.962]  This is battlefield interrogation equipment in its first instance.
[03:18:42.742 --> 03:18:48.084]  The capacitance of the equipment, I was very concerned about the look of it.
[03:18:48.464 --> 03:18:52.246]  It didn't look anything like a license plate recognition camera.
[03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:57.782]  On closer inspection, it wasn't what I believed it to be.
[03:18:57.862 --> 03:19:07.067]  Consequently, I wrote to Transport for London and asked Transport for London the technical breakdown of the hardware.
[03:19:07.787 --> 03:19:12.369]  They came back and said it was a Class 1 LED array.
[03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.650]  It wasn't that.
[03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:16.712]  I could tell they were laser diodes just by looking at them.
[03:19:16.732 --> 03:19:19.413]  They then said there was no radar.
[03:19:20.225 --> 03:19:30.688]  Now I know this to be what's called fusion technology, so to mix a LIDAR, which is a laser phased array element, as well as a radar phased array element.
[03:19:31.268 --> 03:19:37.990]  Both of those elements together are extremely dangerous to all biological life in the beam wave.
[03:19:39.010 --> 03:19:41.251]  The radar has never been known to be safe.
[03:19:42.431 --> 03:19:46.592]  It's very dangerous at distances from the weapon.
[03:19:47.350 --> 03:19:55.377]  And when we went, I actually had a look inside of this equipment and realised that it's what's called rad hot.
[03:19:56.138 --> 03:19:57.559]  And that means it's going to burn hot.
[03:19:58.400 --> 03:20:09.049]  The symbols on the front of the LIDAR weapon, the laser weapon, they also signify that they are actually class four.
[03:20:09.089 --> 03:20:12.012]  These are infrared laser diodes.
[03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:16.654]  There's a symbol in there that shows that these are lasers.
[03:20:17.916 --> 03:20:20.438]  Transport for London tell me they're LEDs.
[03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:22.621]  They most certainly are not.
[03:20:24.042 --> 03:20:47.977]  Even though I've pointed this out to Transport for London, the Freedom of Information Request is an environmental impact analysis, as we're all entitled to, they've come back and stated there's no, that's the laser symbol there, and that's the burn hard, so electronic equipment where you can actually get a burn in the hand, where it shows the laser beam travelling through the hand, that shows it's going to run hot.
[03:20:48.607 --> 03:20:52.730]  Now, Transport for London say these are LEDs, they most certainly are not.
[03:20:53.310 --> 03:21:01.296]  And not only are they not LEDs, these are Category 4 lasers, and there's 24 in the head.
[03:21:02.096 --> 03:21:09.201]  That's not for, you know, visualisation in a built-up urban environment.
[03:21:09.462 --> 03:21:17.007]  These, the two cameras in the equipment, one's an infrared camera, one's a vision system, that's infrared on the right,
[03:21:17.921 --> 03:21:20.202]  You've got a vision system camera on the left.
[03:21:20.862 --> 03:21:24.503]  The infrared camera doesn't require artificial light.
[03:21:25.183 --> 03:21:36.047]  There is artificial light because you're in a cityscape where you've got artificial light, so there's no necessity to even have an LED array if it was an LED array, but it isn't.
[03:21:36.387 --> 03:21:46.890]  That actually leaves us extremely potentially lethal, and they are interconnected with the contamination that was injected using the bioweapon.
[03:21:49.956 --> 03:22:05.290]  I want to pause you there and I do want to talk about the nanoparticulates, but just for anyone that doesn't fully grasp what's happening here, these weapons systems are being deployed across smart cities all over the world and we just need to look at the UK where we do have people like the
[03:22:06.511 --> 03:22:07.812]  Oh jeez, I've forgotten their name now.
[03:22:08.673 --> 03:22:10.434]  The Blade Runners, that's right, yes.
[03:22:10.774 --> 03:22:14.697]  The Blade Runners going who, you've told me Mark, are actually, a lot of them are engineers.
[03:22:14.737 --> 03:22:16.018]  They actually know what they're doing.
[03:22:16.358 --> 03:22:19.841]  These aren't just, you know, vigilante, regular vigilantes.
[03:22:19.881 --> 03:22:23.484]  These people are experts in this and they're
[03:22:24.164 --> 03:22:30.789]  Taking down this technology and dissecting it, and you've been in contact with them, and they are confirming everything that you're saying.
[03:22:30.849 --> 03:22:33.471]  But not only that, we have admission.
[03:22:33.651 --> 03:22:38.195]  You know, the team just brought up from Unix Traffic, you know, it says it's a radar device.
[03:22:38.355 --> 03:22:40.596]  The Heimdall detector is a radar device.
[03:22:41.978 --> 03:22:45.642]  And they are talking about the dangers of the exposure to this team.
[03:22:45.682 --> 03:22:50.827]  If you've got that video, please, if you can just play it on mute because it does have some language.
[03:22:50.867 --> 03:22:56.854]  It's the LiDAR video where you actually see this thing pulsing as Mark is explaining this weapon.
[03:23:00.157 --> 03:23:02.140]  Mark, please continue with your point before.
[03:23:03.191 --> 03:23:06.374]  Well, these are bioinformatics technologies.
[03:23:06.394 --> 03:23:08.176]  They're very, very sophisticated.
[03:23:08.216 --> 03:23:09.236]  They're state-of-the-art.
[03:23:09.917 --> 03:23:11.819]  You'll see the pulse modulation there.
[03:23:12.631 --> 03:23:13.933]  So you'll see that flicker.
[03:23:14.133 --> 03:23:18.217]  What you never want in an optical radiation emitter is what's called flicker.
[03:23:18.678 --> 03:23:20.840]  This operates in the non-visible spectrum.
[03:23:21.261 --> 03:23:22.662]  You can see it pulsing away there.
[03:23:23.003 --> 03:23:25.265]  People will be losing control of their vehicles.
[03:23:25.285 --> 03:23:29.009]  There's over 3% of the population who are photosensitive.
[03:23:29.410 --> 03:23:34.055]  They would lose control of their vehicle when exposed to those lasers.
[03:23:34.575 --> 03:23:39.117]  The lasers also, firing lasers at moving traffic is a criminal offence.
[03:23:39.137 --> 03:23:42.899]  It breaches the laser legislation.
[03:23:43.420 --> 03:23:44.680]  So you've got a laser head.
[03:23:45.421 --> 03:23:48.562]  Obviously, that's the reason why Transport for London tell me it's an LED.
[03:23:48.622 --> 03:23:49.763]  It most certainly isn't.
[03:23:50.023 --> 03:23:56.926]  Unfortunately, the people who manufacture it actually put a laser symbol on the front of the weapon.
[03:23:57.447 --> 03:23:59.768]  So it's an extremely dangerous piece of hardware.
[03:23:59.868 --> 03:24:02.169]  It has massive capacitance internally.
[03:24:02.819 --> 03:24:19.229]  When we actually got a look inside of the equipment, I was extremely surprised to see a military-grade piece of equipment, a modem, a high-speed modem that was manufactured in China.
[03:24:19.289 --> 03:24:21.590]  This would be a national security threat
[03:24:27.485 --> 03:24:32.108]  having something like that in a piece of equipment on a street in London.
[03:24:32.508 --> 03:24:36.831]  So that's the Thiel's piece of hardware there.
[03:24:36.971 --> 03:24:37.932]  It's made in China.
[03:24:37.952 --> 03:24:44.075]  It's a high-speed modem and it is connected to the Azure platform.
[03:24:44.115 --> 03:24:50.639]  This is the Microsoft Lockheed Martin 5G military AI operating platform.
[03:24:50.659 --> 03:24:53.321]  So you've got a military-grade operating platform
[03:24:54.099 --> 03:24:57.383]  You've got connections with all the defence industry.
[03:24:57.523 --> 03:24:59.666]  All of that equipment is all defence.
[03:24:59.726 --> 03:25:01.869]  It's all battlefield interrogation equipment.
[03:25:02.249 --> 03:25:05.013]  These are military battlefield weapons systems.
[03:25:05.493 --> 03:25:07.636]  That's what your C40 city is.
[03:25:08.197 --> 03:25:11.221]  Someone is planning a large extermination
[03:25:11.781 --> 03:25:17.270]  The infrared emissions are specifically connected to the contamination.
[03:25:17.410 --> 03:25:24.882]  The gadolium and the cerium coated nanoparticles, the upconverted nanoparticles, were found in the
[03:25:26.022 --> 03:25:45.278]  Any injections, and these are specifically this type of infrared emission, I can basically stop your heart causing neurological damage, because I can convert the IR into an energy field within the body where it reflects off these upconverted nanoparticles.
[03:25:45.658 --> 03:25:47.960]  So this is basically a weapons deployment
[03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:51.153]  It's right across most cities in the United Kingdom.
[03:25:51.693 --> 03:25:53.995]  Masquerading as an EMP or camera.
[03:25:54.015 --> 03:25:55.657]  It's nothing like an EMP or camera.
[03:25:55.677 --> 03:25:57.018]  You only have to look at the size of it.
[03:25:57.439 --> 03:26:02.944]  And when you get a look inside the hardware, you'll see it's extremely concerning.
[03:26:03.064 --> 03:26:03.364]  The fact
[03:26:04.165 --> 03:26:17.328]  I want to pause you there, Mark, because this UpConversion team, if we can get an overhead shot here, there is an article in Nature Communications about UpConversion Super Bowls for programmable photoactivation of therapeutics.
[03:26:17.808 --> 03:26:26.610]  And so they say that UpConversion nanoparticles are the preferred choice for deep tissue photoactivation owing to their unique ability
[03:26:27.190 --> 03:26:27.570]  We're good.
[03:26:50.186 --> 03:26:54.528]  Change our genes through us viewing light.
[03:26:54.968 --> 03:26:56.229]  They have figured this out.
[03:26:56.249 --> 03:27:01.111]  This is why Biden tried to ban and did ban incandescent lights.
[03:27:01.171 --> 03:27:03.192]  This is why they want LED lights everywhere.
[03:27:03.612 --> 03:27:10.195]  Photodynamic therapy, photo activated drug slash biomolecule release and photo controlled gene expression.
[03:27:10.235 --> 03:27:10.735]  So this is
[03:27:11.155 --> 03:27:24.158]  All of these technologies that are being deployed are related to changing the human being and having constant surveillance of the human inside the internet of everything, which is where Azure comes in, Mark.
[03:27:24.178 --> 03:27:25.938]  So that's what I want to talk to you about now.
[03:27:25.978 --> 03:27:35.781]  So for anyone that isn't aware, the Microsoft Azure platform says that it's a cloud computing platform, but this is far more than just cloud computing.
[03:27:35.841 --> 03:27:37.061]  So talk to us about that, Mark.
[03:27:38.433 --> 03:27:45.455]  Well, Azure has an AI system, and it was developed in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, a large defence contract company.
[03:27:46.676 --> 03:27:57.039]  The modem in that piece of hardware is Thiel's, and Thiel's also collaborate with the Azure platform.
[03:27:57.419 --> 03:28:00.140]  Now, Thiel's are a large defence contract company.
[03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:04.021]  Obviously, people that know Lockheed Martin, they're a defence contract company.
[03:28:04.361 --> 03:28:08.062]  So everything in this piece of hardware is defence contract
[03:28:08.986 --> 03:28:33.039]  uh related and not only that the people who carried out the environmental impact analysis for this equipment in London are Jacobs another large defense contract company and what was quite telling is the fact that Jacobs for some inexplicable reason just missed out from an environmental impact analysis the radar and the lidar they totally missed it out
[03:28:33.659 --> 03:28:55.693]  is if it didn't exist I've asked Transport for London about its existence and I've actually have all the documents all the hardware documents and the actual hardware and the visualization of it and Transport for London say it doesn't exist even though I can actually I can actually see it I've actually had my hands on it I've actually got the technical details of it and the fusion technology
[03:28:57.210 --> 03:29:15.627]  Transport for London and I, Fusion Technology, in this Living Experiment Lab that I've spoken about in relation to this Fusion Tech, and it's actually in the UNIX document, it tells you they're collaborating with Transport for London to bring about this Living Laboratory
[03:29:16.127 --> 03:29:22.589]  Across London using fusion technology it's all in there and they're telling me that they don't know anything about it.
[03:29:22.609 --> 03:29:34.353]  I mean if that's not a conspiracy and they're in a total panic and the other thing that's which shows there's a significant problem the guys that have been arrested we've got a case
[03:29:35.327 --> 03:29:38.029]  Which currently is being pushed back to mid-2026.
[03:29:38.290 --> 03:29:43.654]  Now we've got people being arrested for misgendering people on the internet.
[03:29:43.734 --> 03:29:52.602]  They're going before a judge within weeks, within days of being arrested for saying things that the government don't want them to say in the United Kingdom.
[03:29:52.902 --> 03:29:58.987]  But here we've got people who have been alleged to have assaulted 999 workers.
[03:30:01.576 --> 03:30:09.561]  When they've been removing this equipment, so got all these allegations in these cases have been pushed back into 2026.
[03:30:09.701 --> 03:30:13.303]  And the reason for that, they do not want me.
[03:30:14.261 --> 03:30:24.010]  In a defence role, Section 3, self-defence, because this equipment is a weapon and anybody is entitled to remove it from their streets.
[03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:27.373]  These are battlefield weapons systems, not cameras.
[03:30:27.553 --> 03:30:32.578]  It doesn't look anything like a camera and anybody who thinks that's a camera, you've got something wrong with you.
[03:30:33.097 --> 03:30:37.681]  Well certainly, you explained that that's definitely, you say, UK law.
[03:30:37.721 --> 03:30:45.867]  I don't know what the laws are in other countries about removing weapons from your streets, but it's clear that they don't want these cases in a court of law from what you're saying.
[03:30:46.328 --> 03:30:51.412]  Team, if you just want to do another overhead shot, this is the Fusion document that Mark was talking about.
[03:30:51.432 --> 03:30:59.919]  This is the Unix traffic about this Fusion technology, and if I go to the next page and show everyone,
[03:31:00.299 --> 03:31:03.841]  It says that Fusion's an entirely new adaptive traffic control system.
[03:31:04.281 --> 03:31:14.947]  It says Fusion contributes directly to the realisation of a city's aspirations, including the achievement of net zero targets, promoting active travel and improving air quality.
[03:31:15.288 --> 03:31:27.715]  Furthermore, in the next paragraph, it says it's been designed to address today's challenges and embrace the latest technologies, data sources and the emerging interconnectivity of people, infrastructure, equipment and vehicles.
[03:31:27.775 --> 03:31:28.175]  That is
[03:31:28.955 --> 03:31:35.317]  Another word for that, everyone, is the Internet of Everything or the Internet of Bodies, but more so the Internet of Everything because it goes beyond the bodies.
[03:31:35.857 --> 03:31:42.099]  Then in this paragraph over here, it says, Fusion allows for all modes of transport to be detected, modelled and optimised.
[03:31:42.479 --> 03:31:48.980]  And it also includes signals, optimisation of signals for all road users, including public transport, pedestrians and cyclists.
[03:31:49.021 --> 03:31:53.082]  Now, what they will sell this as is optimisation of traffic.
[03:31:53.422 --> 03:31:54.122]  But when you go
[03:31:54.762 --> 03:31:58.745]  Further on, and look at how it's talking about the connectivity of people.
[03:31:59.105 --> 03:32:05.870]  They are referring, obviously, clearly, for anyone who understands smart cities, to the Internet of Bodies and the Internet of Everything.
[03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:11.653]  But I want to show you on this page here where it says that Fusion has been designed to incorporate AI.
[03:32:12.734 --> 03:32:19.318]  Dynamic prioritisation for individual road user groups include pedestrians, cyclists and public transport.
[03:32:19.778 --> 03:32:28.183]  It is the entire road network that is being monitored and this is the key word that Mark referenced before, living laboratory.
[03:32:28.663 --> 03:32:48.901]  They are calling it a laboratory and this is the same language that I've referenced on multiple occasions in the Melbourne experiment, Mark, where they locked down the city of Melbourne and they said this was a living lab, 252 days in lockdown, you know, the next, I mean, it barely
[03:32:49.681 --> 03:32:53.804]  It's pretty much almost China and this is a living laboratory.
[03:32:53.844 --> 03:33:08.175]  The UN brags about it and we're going to extend this to the whole world and now you have this fusion document using that same language of living laboratory for mass surveillance and so-called net zero goals, Mark.
[03:33:08.215 --> 03:33:11.378]  This is absolutely terrifying and dystopian.
[03:33:13.223 --> 03:33:13.683]  Absolutely.
[03:33:13.743 --> 03:33:21.266]  Well, these are battlefield-derived weapons systems masquerading as some transport network control mechanism.
[03:33:21.927 --> 03:33:30.870]  These are connected with what was actually injected into the general population, the graphite ferritic nanomaterial antennas, so you can track people.
[03:33:31.291 --> 03:33:39.194]  These will pick up the bioinformatics technologies, so they can monitor your biometrics, they can actually monitor the sickness, ill health and death
[03:33:40.083 --> 03:33:45.867]  across the cityscape, and I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons for this mass surveillance.
[03:33:46.328 --> 03:33:58.397]  These are audio-able technologies, so not only can they monitor, you know, numbers in vehicles, the radar elements, I mean, if you think about it, the radar itself is extremely dangerous.
[03:33:58.977 --> 03:34:07.384]  If you're focusing that into a vehicle so I can elucidate how many people are sitting in that vehicle, can you imagine being a cyclist or a pedestrian
[03:34:08.104 --> 03:34:16.029]  A cyclist who's got no protection, a motorcyclist, you haven't got this vehicle shell around you which will give you a small amount of protection.
[03:34:16.409 --> 03:34:32.319]  With no protection at all from this, you'll get, you know, the cancer rates are going to go catastrophic, the infrared element causes cataracts, so we've got lots of people losing control of vehicles at these junctions, at what I call a kill box.
[03:34:32.979 --> 03:34:42.543]  The actual gun site, the gun site is aimed up with the LIDAR to a point just 20 metres away from the weapons.
[03:34:43.043 --> 03:34:59.550]  So you're coming into a kill box area where you could be facial recognition, that that is capable of facial recognition, it would be able to monitor biometrics and it can basically exterminate and I've got no doubt that they've already tested it.
[03:35:00.663 --> 03:35:09.045]  As every day goes on, as every week passes, these weapons are being refined to get better because they're machine learning.
[03:35:09.566 --> 03:35:18.188]  It's an AI system, it's machine learning, so it's getting more and more adept at using itself, at testing itself out on the general population.
[03:35:18.548 --> 03:35:20.809]  These are serious, lethal
[03:35:21.678 --> 03:35:21.818]  Well,
[03:35:37.584 --> 03:35:38.605]  I think so.
[03:35:52.976 --> 03:36:00.543]  Advanced extermination camps with the light emitting diodes, the 5G network, the smart, smart city grid.
[03:36:01.023 --> 03:36:07.588]  All of that poses massive stresses on the body, cancer risks and ill health and death.
[03:36:07.969 --> 03:36:10.231]  And we're seeing that, we're seeing the cancer epidemic etc.
[03:36:10.791 --> 03:36:11.832]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:36:11.952 --> 03:36:13.753]  And people will say, oh, it's just from the shots.
[03:36:13.813 --> 03:36:22.118]  No, actually, there is a there is correlation between being in these cities that have excessive amounts of 5G.
[03:36:22.858 --> 03:36:25.480]  You know, it's and it's not just the shots, Mark.
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:27.561]  It's it's what they're poisoning the food.
[03:36:27.581 --> 03:36:28.682]  They're poisoning the water.
[03:36:28.702 --> 03:36:30.143]  They're poisoning the skies.
[03:36:30.523 --> 03:36:36.347]  They want, I don't know, a world coated in nanoparticles so that they can map out.
[03:36:36.387 --> 03:36:38.088]  And this is actually, you know, they've said this.
[03:36:38.128 --> 03:36:39.789]  They want to map out every single
[03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.590]  I don't
[03:36:55.066 --> 03:37:01.009]  The Australian government helped move these people from this island.
[03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:10.374]  These people have been living there for generations and they told them, oh sorry, because of climate change and rising sea levels, you can't live on this island anymore.
[03:37:10.795 --> 03:37:14.877]  You need to move out of there and you can only visit your home through the metaverse.
[03:37:15.157 --> 03:37:18.099]  This actually happened and Australia took these people in.
[03:37:18.119 --> 03:37:19.019]  I have to check
[03:37:19.019 --> 03:37:26.342]  I don't want to check whether the military was involved, but I certainly remember it was a very quiet announcement halfway through the day on state-funded television.
[03:37:26.362 --> 03:37:30.124]  I only caught it because I was in a hotel at the time watching to see what they were up to.
[03:37:30.144 --> 03:37:32.005]  It was so quiet.
[03:37:32.485 --> 03:37:37.327]  Not many people would have heard about this, Mark, but this is stripping people from their homes.
[03:37:37.387 --> 03:37:38.708]  And this is an example, guys.
[03:37:38.748 --> 03:37:39.989]  This was a test case.
[03:37:40.089 --> 03:37:46.311]  The island of Tuvalu was a test case for the other places around the world where they're going to say, oh, too much climate change.
[03:37:46.752 --> 03:37:47.212]  Sorry.
[03:37:47.512 --> 03:37:55.464]  You can't live here anymore but you can go and visit your home in the Metaverse and meanwhile they're ushering you into these kill boxes that Mark is describing here.
[03:37:55.504 --> 03:37:59.851]  This is absolutely horrific and we have to stop these people, Mark.
[03:37:59.891 --> 03:38:02.155]  Tell me, what are the people in the UK doing about this?
[03:38:03.556 --> 03:38:11.826]  Well, we've got, there's lots and lots of Blade Runners, there's a growing number, and what we've seen recently is massive divisive tactics.
[03:38:12.186 --> 03:38:12.386]  Yes.
[03:38:12.406 --> 03:38:18.573]  Where we've got, you know, the government playing this, you know, Christians against Muslims, Muslims against Jews.
[03:38:18.934 --> 03:38:24.180]  All this nonsense is a divisive tactic because they now know we know their plan.
[03:38:24.798 --> 03:38:27.880]  We've got the biometrics weapons systems.
[03:38:28.100 --> 03:38:30.282]  We've got the bioweapons injection.
[03:38:30.322 --> 03:38:32.463]  We've got the biochemical weapons spraying.
[03:38:33.003 --> 03:38:34.364]  We know we are at war.
[03:38:34.404 --> 03:38:35.285]  This is warfare.
[03:38:35.325 --> 03:38:38.787]  These are warfare weapons that are being deployed on our streets.
[03:38:38.847 --> 03:38:48.293]  And what the government's only answer is to create all of this divisive deflection when people need to focus on the job in hand.
[03:38:48.493 --> 03:38:49.934]  We've got them where we want them.
[03:38:49.994 --> 03:38:54.197]  We've got the evidence now to show this is a mass murderous
[03:38:55.106 --> 03:38:58.129]  Mass genocidal agenda, and it's playing out.
[03:38:58.249 --> 03:39:01.032]  The body count is rising, the current body count.
[03:39:01.513 --> 03:39:10.462]  The people who are dying from these Covid-19 injections mixed with the electromagnetic radiation fields from 5G, they are collateral damage.
[03:39:10.682 --> 03:39:11.984]  They're not the main kill.
[03:39:12.464 --> 03:39:17.226]  The main kill will come once they get everybody injected.
[03:39:17.246 --> 03:39:23.108]  They have to get everybody injected, so there's about 15 million people in the United Kingdom.
[03:39:23.508 --> 03:39:30.931]  I can tell you now, if they don't get you injected, when they pull this trigger, there's a high probability you may not die.
[03:39:31.431 --> 03:39:47.885]  Well that's the thing, and that's why they're saying now, Mark, sorry to cut you off but this is so important, Alex was just covering it earlier today, Peter Hotez, and he's been covering it for a couple of weeks, Peter Hotez saying we need the Department of Homeland Security and NATO to come and combat anti-vaccine aggression.
[03:39:48.146 --> 03:39:50.888]  We've got to put people in re-education camps.
[03:39:51.949 --> 03:39:59.273]  Queensland Premier in Australia, Anastasia Palaszczuk, when she was asked on national television one morning, what are these camps going to be used for?
[03:39:59.333 --> 03:40:00.934]  She said, for the unvaccinated.
[03:40:01.254 --> 03:40:07.577]  They are ramping up this rhetoric now, and I recall the WHO calling anti-vaccine people
[03:40:09.838 --> 03:40:11.939]  Terrorists equating us to terrorists.
[03:40:12.279 --> 03:40:15.000]  I mean, these people are ramping up this rhetoric now.
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:24.725]  And so we are literally in a race against the clock to wake the rest of humanity up and stop taking these poison shots, stop taking their poison medicines.
[03:40:25.025 --> 03:40:26.905]  And we need to take back control of our countries.
[03:40:26.945 --> 03:40:28.126]  Mark, we're almost out of time.
[03:40:28.166 --> 03:40:32.308]  Can you please let people know where they can follow you and keep track of this?
[03:40:32.368 --> 03:40:37.010]  Because I guarantee you, if they're deploying these weapons in the UK, they're deploying them everywhere.
[03:40:38.448 --> 03:40:39.429]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:40:39.509 --> 03:40:47.415]  You can contact me at saveusnow.org.uk or you can make contact through our sub-stack.
[03:40:48.136 --> 03:40:51.138]  Obviously, our communications are blocked significantly.
[03:40:51.759 --> 03:40:54.981]  If you don't get through, try us on, you know, Telegram.
[03:40:55.021 --> 03:40:56.162]  I've got a Telegram channel.
[03:40:56.182 --> 03:40:57.704]  You may be able to find me there.
[03:40:58.684 --> 03:41:00.426]  But, you know, we've just got to try our best.
[03:41:00.466 --> 03:41:03.168]  But I say to people, go on the offensive.
[03:41:03.308 --> 03:41:05.250]  Offence is the best form of defence.
[03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:06.811]  We now have
[03:41:07.575 --> 03:41:08.136]  Absolutely.
[03:41:09.257 --> 03:41:09.957]  100% positive.
[03:41:10.498 --> 03:41:13.000]  This 15 minute city is not for control.
[03:41:13.020 --> 03:41:18.504]  They only want to control you via CBDC so that they can exterminate you.
[03:41:18.564 --> 03:41:20.306]  It's an extermination plan.
[03:41:20.786 --> 03:41:21.427]  Fourth Reich
[03:41:22.256 --> 03:41:23.657]  Call it the Industrial Revolution.
[03:41:23.978 --> 03:41:30.824]  This is the fourth rake, the fourth rake termination using this termination track trace technology.
[03:41:31.185 --> 03:41:34.168]  Mark Steele, really, really appreciate your time again.
[03:41:34.208 --> 03:41:37.311]  Saveusnow.org.uk is where you can find him.
[03:41:38.031 --> 03:41:40.574]  Really appreciate your time and I'm sure we'll speak again soon, Mark.
[03:41:40.614 --> 03:41:41.175]  God bless you.
[03:41:41.535 --> 03:41:46.480]  You know, the things that this gentleman is telling us about are so, so important and even if
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:49.862]  This is all new to you and you haven't looked up C40 Cities.
[03:41:49.902 --> 03:41:56.606]  I want to encourage people go to the C40 Cities website or even visit the Global Covenant of Mayors website.
[03:41:56.646 --> 03:42:01.188]  This is where you can find out if your mayor is currently involved in this.
[03:42:01.228 --> 03:42:07.032]  They have said before that these people are going to be financially incentivized to get us to this point.
[03:42:07.072 --> 03:42:10.414]  If you recall, I gave you the ambitious and progressive
[03:42:11.014 --> 03:42:14.095]  Sorry, progressive and ambitious targets for C40 cities.
[03:42:14.155 --> 03:42:17.456]  Three items of clothing, no meat, no dairy, no transport.
[03:42:17.476 --> 03:42:18.416]  You can't go anywhere.
[03:42:18.676 --> 03:42:19.696]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:42:19.716 --> 03:42:22.717]  They want to lock you in these kill boxes.
[03:42:22.757 --> 03:42:24.657]  So please share this information everywhere.
[03:42:25.017 --> 03:42:26.558]  Thank you all so much for your time.
[03:42:26.638 --> 03:42:28.718]  Thank you for supporting InfoWars.
[03:42:28.778 --> 03:42:37.741]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com and support this broadcast so we can, this network and those who contribute can keep getting the word out.
[03:42:38.281 --> 03:42:38.921]  Thank you everyone.
[03:42:49.813 --> 03:42:57.839]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:42:58.840 --> 03:43:02.602]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:43:03.063 --> 03:43:05.264]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:43:06.085 --> 03:43:11.509]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:43:12.566 --> 03:43:21.131]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:43:21.471 --> 03:43:23.333]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:43:23.953 --> 03:43:28.456]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[03:43:29.176 --> 03:43:34.840]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:43:34.860 --> 03:43:37.741]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:43:38.562 --> 03:43:40.083]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:43:41.297 --> 03:43:57.288]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:57.688 --> 03:44:04.353]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:44:05.487 --> 03:44:16.313]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[03:44:17.333 --> 03:44:25.435]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:44:25.516 --> 03:44:32.158]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:44:32.298 --> 03:44:34.798]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:44:34.958 --> 03:44:36.879]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:44:37.079 --> 03:44:46.865]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:44:47.485 --> 03:44:49.886]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:49.946 --> 03:44:51.007]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:52.688 --> 03:44:59.371]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:59.491 --> 03:45:05.154]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:45:05.274 --> 03:45:13.778]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:45:13.838 --> 03:45:15.939]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:45:16.159 --> 03:45:16.279]  And,
[03:45:17.546 --> 03:45:30.811]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:45:31.311 --> 03:45:35.693]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:45:35.773 --> 03:45:40.415]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:45:40.675 --> 03:45:41.155]  We're good to go!
[03:45:41.175 --> 03:45:41.616]  We're good to go!
[03:45:41.636 --> 03:45:42.456]  We're good to go!

[03:45:46.980 --> 03:45:47.841]  We're good to go!

[03:45:52.624 --> 03:45:53.385]  We're good to go!

[03:45:55.226 --> 03:45:55.847]  We're good to go!
[03:45:55.867 --> 03:45:57.008]  We're good to go!
[03:45:57.128 --> 03:45:57.748]  We're good to go!
[03:45:57.768 --> 03:45:58.469]  We're good to go!
[03:45:58.509 --> 03:45:59.069]  We're good to go!
[03:45:59.089 --> 03:46:00.150]  We're good to go!
[03:46:00.230 --> 03:46:00.811]  We're good to go!
[03:46:00.831 --> 03:46:01.431]  We're good to go!
[03:46:01.451 --> 03:46:01.891]  We're good to go!
[03:46:01.931 --> 03:46:02.372]  We're good to go!
[03:46:02.392 --> 03:46:02.852]  We're good to go!
[03:46:02.912 --> 03:46:03.873]  We're good to go!
[03:46:03.893 --> 03:46:04.794]  We're good to go!
[03:46:04.854 --> 03:46:05.714]  We're good to go!
[03:46:05.734 --> 03:46:06.555]  We're good to go!
[03:46:06.575 --> 03:46:07.095]  We're good to go!
[03:46:07.115 --> 03:46:07.336]  We're
