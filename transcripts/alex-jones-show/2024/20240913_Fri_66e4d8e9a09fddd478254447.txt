[00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.180]  We are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti.
[00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.007]  And we are telling the American people that the 32,000, over 32,000 emails that Hillary Clinton said she deleted
[00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:43.756]  The Clintons have a long history with the Black Republic of Haiti.
[00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:51.520]  In January of 2010, after 220,000 Haitians were decimated in an earthquake, the world responded by pouring in $13 billion in donations.
[00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:59.730]  And a year after the quake, Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern announced plans to create, quote, brand new communities.
[00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.934]  The Haitian people have not seen not even 2% of that money.
[00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:03.934]  2%?
[00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:06.076]  Nothing was done in Haiti.
[00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:13.142]  After the Clintons descended on Haiti like vultures and the Laura Silsby abduction of 33 Haitian children unfolded.
[00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:19.208]  We already know that some of these children still have parents because an elderly girl might be 8 or 9 years old.
[00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:23.676]  He told us crying, I'm not an orphan, I do have my parents.
[00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.281]  You can't just pick up a child and walk out of the country with a child.
[00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:27.901]  Clearly.
[00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.062]  No matter what your best intentions are.
[00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:38.387]  Of course, Haiti is currently run by a Freemason cannibal, dubbed Barbecue, because of his penchant for torching his enemies.
[00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.668]  Jimmy Chirizier is a former policeman.
[00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.829]  He's under sanctions from the UK for his actions here.
[00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.892]  But he does remain one of the most powerful people in Haiti today, and he doesn't like being interrupted.
[00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:49.532]  Hey!
[00:01:49.753 --> 00:01:50.053]  Hey!
[00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:51.073]  Hey!
[00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:56.260]  This is the Guatemalan and Salvadoran consulates being ransacked.
[00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.962]  Hospitals have been too.
[00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:03.867]  In most of the capital, it's not the police in control, but Haiti's ultra-violent gangs.
[00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:07.150]  This is the Haiti we have all come to know and love.
[00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.636]  While we were in Haiti, we offered Haitians their own version of Make America Great Again hats.
[00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:16.538]  It's a hat that says Haiti is great already.
[00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:18.460]  We offered it to them and they were quite happy to have it.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.481]  Who's heard of Donald Trump?
[00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:21.842]  Can you translate?
[00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:30.068]  Donald Trump was on television, and then a bunch of grown-ups got drunk, and they made him president.
[00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:45.038]  After the Clintons had their way with Haiti, manipulating its economy in the 1990s and then plundering the millions in aid money the world gave the survivors of the 2010 earthquake, it has been a slippery slope.
[00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:47.399]  So, where did the money go?
[00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:58.242]  Well, the country's first act was to provide what they claimed were hurricane-proof emergency trailers, which they say could also have been used to school the island's children.
[00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:00.603]  Didn't turn out too well.
[00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:04.665]  Two more bodies, a man and a woman shot as they rode a motorcycle.
[00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:07.185]  Nobody knows why any of these murders are happening.
[00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:08.926]  We see the dead every day.
[00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:14.148]  Under the umbrella of the Biden administration, total chaos has been unleashed.
[00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:21.110]  Even as the international community gets behind a new Haiti-led transition plan to end the gang uprising.
[00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.772]  President Biden's reaction?
[00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:28.619]  Send the survivors that make it out to Guantanamo Bay and then flood Florida with them.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.001]  What are we doing?
[00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:39.608]  To prepare for that wave and to ensure that these people are not paroled into the United States as the administration has done with people on the southern border.
[00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:42.069]  But these aren't your average refugees.
[00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.133]  These refugees bring the Democrats' normalization of cannibalism to our shores as well.
[00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:55.298]  Because the most ingenious way to reduce the population is to have that population eat itself.
[00:03:55.758 --> 00:04:07.002]  So they're saying that they can take tissue and muscle from celebrities and mix it with animal meat and some other things and grow actual meats out of it in a lab.
[00:04:07.382 --> 00:04:10.743]  If the person okayed it, I would eat a human.
[00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:16.438]  If you were at a very fancy restaurant, and they were like, a tiny piece of human meat.
[00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:17.078]  No, no, no.
[00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.620]  I think the only way I would- You wouldn't try a tiny bite?
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.520]  No.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.081]  Really?
[00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:21.781]  Absolutely not.
[00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:27.645]  A man is in custody after a witness said he was eating a detached leg.
[00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:28.845]  You heard that right.
[00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:36.550]  Kern County Sheriff's Office tells us that that detached leg came from a person hit by a train in this area this morning.
[00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.232]  For airborne states, we just chop human meat.
[00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:47.417]  And Biden adds, furthermore, have them bankrupt the blue cities and then have them all ship to red states.
[00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:58.104]  Last fall, DHS sent this official notice saying nearly 600 quote non-citizens were looking to travel to these areas highlighted on your screen.
[00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:04.635]  There may still be some use for the Haitians when it comes to the criminal aims of the Democratic Party.
[00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:07.357]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:09.278]  All right, folks, it's Friday.
[00:05:09.378 --> 00:05:11.539]  This has got to be the most massive news show ever.
[00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:11.779]  Wait.
[00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:12.259]  Wait for it.
[00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.160]  It's Friday, September 13, 2024.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.060]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:05:29.386 --> 00:05:33.569]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.954]  We are 52 days, 52 days from the most important election in world history.
[00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:42.496]  All right, it's now official.
[00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:57.847]  They announced yesterday that the White House is set to announce this weekend that NATO and the United States are to provide thousands of missiles, heavy missiles, to attack Russian military bases all over Russia.
[00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:02.304]  So, this is officially NATO going to war with Russia.
[00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:06.165]  We've been sleepwalked into this in the last two and a half years.
[00:06:07.926 --> 00:06:13.467]  NATO, of course, with proxy war for 11 years, has been overthrowing the Ukrainian government and starting all of this.
[00:06:13.487 --> 00:06:16.528]  When you go to the Drudge Report, what's the top headline?
[00:06:16.568 --> 00:06:22.990]  Laura Magalov, MTG calls Don enraged, civil war escalates, campaign in crisis.
[00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.210]  That's absolutely made up.
[00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:25.631]  Nothing's going on.
[00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:29.799]  That's just, just, oh my gosh, two women are arguing with each other.
[00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:43.002]  We're on the verge of World War III, and that's what the Democrats, I saw it on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox talking about it without even looking, just on TVs at my house and in the coffee break room.
[00:06:44.483 --> 00:06:48.244]  That's all they're talking about is how Kamala won the debate, which she didn't.
[00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:51.362]  Trump could have done better, but he won handily.
[00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:52.603]  She lied the whole time.
[00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:55.465]  I mean, even if you listen to the rhetoric and don't know facts, he won.
[00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:57.206]  If you know that he was telling the truth, she lied.
[00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.146]  He totally won.
[00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:01.388]  But they're talking about, oh, Trump's in deep trouble.
[00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:02.469]  Oh, Trump's dominated.
[00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.610]  Oh, it's all over for Trump.
[00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.811]  Here's the headline.
[00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.752]  Kamala Harris broke Donald Trump.
[00:07:07.832 --> 00:07:08.373]  The Atlantic.
[00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:09.293]  That's the CIA.
[00:07:09.814 --> 00:07:11.955]  That's literally the Jeffrey Epstein island operation.
[00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:14.777]  That's who owns that and runs that is that exact group.
[00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:17.919]  So we have that.
[00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.712]  And Putin's saying, if you start bombing us directly with precision weapons guided by your satellites, we're gonna hit Europe and the US.
[00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:27.832]  I mean, that's it.
[00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:31.413]  I mean, nothing like this happened, even in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:40.535]  This is, all the experts agree, this is the most dangerous it's ever been, of course, 52 days out from the most important election in world history.
[00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:46.057]  So when I, I keep saying this, this is the most hardcore show ever.
[00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:50.118]  20 years ago I said that maybe once a year because things were getting crazier.
[00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.341]  Now it's every few days because it just escalates, escalates.
[00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.102]  The news here...
[00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:56.509]  Is so incredible.
[00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.371]  And the bad stuff that Globalist is doing is more intense.
[00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:00.951]  The good stuff happening is more intense.
[00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:04.633]  The wheels coming off their operations is more intense.
[00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:08.214]  Let me just show you what I've got.
[00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:09.775]  Look at this giant group of stacks.
[00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:09.775]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
[00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:25.498]  Some of these stacks are three inches tall, each story insanely bombshell.
[00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:32.022]  They've announced total world government, global cashless society run by the UN, an official announcement.
[00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:32.963]  That's one article.
[00:08:35.204 --> 00:08:40.668]  They are announcing that Ford, for years, is listening to everything you say in your car, with vehicles going back a decade.
[00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:42.089]  Well, so are all the other devices.
[00:08:42.329 --> 00:08:43.450]  And the FBI is investigating.
[00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.231]  What do you think Alexa is in your house?
[00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:46.412]  What do you think your phone is?
[00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:48.210]  They're listening to everything.
[00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.591]  That's CBS News, though.
[00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.032]  Oh my God, they're listening to it in your car!
[00:08:51.293 --> 00:08:51.633]  Yeah!
[00:08:52.193 --> 00:08:53.875]  Biden made it the law two years ago.
[00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.359]  Tracks everything, everywhere you go, with microphones and GPS.
[00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:01.802]  So, that's totally insane.
[00:09:01.822 --> 00:09:05.325]  That's just one article out of probably 300 in front of me or more.
[00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.848]  Every one of them is that insane.
[00:09:08.994 --> 00:09:12.295]  Major studies, John Hopkins, British Medical Journal.
[00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:14.415]  Oh my God, it is causing cancer, the shots.
[00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:16.795]  Record blood clots, it's all true.
[00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:19.116]  Infertility, oh my God, here's more shots for you.
[00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:22.476]  Giant stack on that, total insanity.
[00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:32.338]  We've got all the key Democrat senators that actually run things in the Senate.
[00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:35.779]  Murray and Blumenthal that have literally quarterbacked the attacks on me.
[00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:38.079]  They've run it with the FBI and CIA on record.
[00:09:39.363 --> 00:09:41.764]  I mean, I'm being deposed, it's the son of Blumenthal in the room.
[00:09:44.544 --> 00:09:49.225]  He comes out and says, this morning, you're going to be shocked, you're going to be blown away.
[00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:55.106]  They had a stand down and they're lying to Congress, both the DHS and the Justice Department.
[00:09:55.606 --> 00:10:00.948]  Why would he and Murray, who are two peas in a pod, everything they say is total deep state.
[00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:03.608]  I mean, they are the Democrat senators.
[00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:07.049]  I mean, Schumer runs around as the politicking and follows the orders, but they're in charge.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.544]  He comes out and says, Oh my God, there's a total stand down, total cover up.
[00:10:12.564 --> 00:10:13.385]  You're going to be shocked.
[00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:15.267]  Why would he do that?
[00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:16.848]  Because they know the truth's coming out.
[00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:29.922]  And I've been talking to people in the Trump operation and in army special operations and in other major organizations, both corporate and private government.
[00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:38.764]  That they found some interesting things in Butler from the witnesses and everything that will be coming out in the next 10 days.
[00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:42.447]  And I told the folks, you need to talk about it now.
[00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:48.844]  One of the people is Jack Posobiec that joins us in the fourth hour I'll be hosting today.
[00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:56.466]  Well, he'll be joining me and Tucker coming up on Monday the 23rd in Reading, Pennsylvania, his hometown.
[00:10:57.426 --> 00:10:59.887]  He'll be joining us and he'll be giving a lot of his findings.
[00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:01.668]  He can give at that point, but not all of them.
[00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:05.449]  And I was talking to him this morning and I've got all other sources saying the same thing.
[00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:06.569]  I said, you got to start releasing this now.
[00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:07.049]  And he said, well,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.741]  We got even more coming.
[00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:13.444]  So we obviously, and I said, look, you know, they're tapping all the phones they already know.
[00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:15.565]  So why not go ahead and bring it out?
[00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:17.567]  So he's like, well, okay.
[00:11:18.247 --> 00:11:18.408]  So.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.822]  He'll get to some of it, a lot of it, coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:25.423]  But I mean, we got their ass.
[00:11:25.823 --> 00:11:28.625]  And we've got whistleblowers, Secret Service, police, everybody.
[00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:29.605]  They were told to stand down.
[00:11:29.905 --> 00:11:30.926]  It wasn't just a screw up.
[00:11:31.306 --> 00:11:35.288]  The guy was out there 90 plus minutes, 26 minutes on the roof, seven, eight minutes with the gun out.
[00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:38.710]  You can see him, you know, naked eye there pointing at Trump.
[00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.112]  I mean, it wasn't the Secret Service that shot him.
[00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:41.792]  It was the cops.
[00:11:42.712 --> 00:11:45.394]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:11:46.274 --> 00:11:46.955]  Oh, but I'm sorry.
[00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:50.948]  Laura Loomer is fighting with MTG.
[00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:57.231]  MTG's not fighting with her, and I like Laura, but, you know, this is just ridiculous.
[00:11:58.192 --> 00:11:59.993]  Oh, what was the top story when nuclear war happened?
[00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:02.855]  Oh, two women arguing supposedly with no witnesses.
[00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:03.555]  Who cares?
[00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:05.796]  Oh my God, Trump's campaign's in trouble.
[00:12:05.836 --> 00:12:06.577]  Two women are arguing.
[00:12:09.008 --> 00:12:13.849]  It's like Godzilla's attacking your city, and you're mad because you sprained your ankle.
[00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:16.810]  Or not even that, you saw an ant walking on the ground.
[00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:16.970]  Look!
[00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.031]  An ant's walking on the ground.
[00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:18.611]  Oh my god!
[00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:21.972]  There's Godzilla, like, vaporizing the city a mile away.
[00:12:23.392 --> 00:12:29.174]  Your house is on fire, and you're dusting the windows, or, you know, dusting the tables.
[00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:32.815]  Your house has got fire shooting through it, there's smoke everywhere you're about to pass out.
[00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.136]  You're like, oh, let me get a drink of ice water out of the refrigerator.
[00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:40.437]  Let me make sure my shoes are tied before I get out of here.
[00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:46.000]  I mean, this is titanic sinking and you're ordering a martini.
[00:12:48.242 --> 00:12:49.262]  Rearranging deck chairs.
[00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:51.244]  So that's what the corporate media's got?
[00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:54.566]  That's all they got, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:56.347]  I mean, literally top story everywhere?
[00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:59.068]  Oh my God, Trump's devastated.
[00:12:59.108 --> 00:12:59.709]  He's in trouble.
[00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:01.690]  Women supposedly secretly argued.
[00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.891]  Oh my God, it's all over!
[00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.668]  They know the public likes mindless crap like that.
[00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:13.273]  So, again, bombshell World War III, most closest ever memo, we'll get to that first.
[00:13:14.274 --> 00:13:19.700]  We've got WEF admits COVID was a test for public obedience to New World Order globalist system.
[00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:27.868]  And they've announced UN pact for the future, digital IDs, vaccine passports, massive censorship and total control run by the UN.
[00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:32.932]  We've got the Secret Service, total stand down, rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:13:33.673 --> 00:13:38.636]  We've got Trump, the two massive economic announcements that's even bigger than no tax on tips.
[00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:43.000]  Boom, Trump proposes and he always does what he says he will or dies trying.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.925]  No taxes on overtime pay and illegal aliens will not be given free grants to get mortgages.
[00:13:52.042 --> 00:13:53.142]  I mean, that is so huge.
[00:13:53.862 --> 00:13:55.403]  Then, of course, I told you this two years ago.
[00:13:55.463 --> 00:13:57.003]  Now it's all been declassified.
[00:13:57.463 --> 00:13:58.504]  Congress is probing it.
[00:13:58.724 --> 00:14:01.484]  Private and think tanks investigators are suing.
[00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:14.468]  The State Department's been running the tyranny and the election fraud, the outlawing of Bolsonaro running and his indictment with the CIA and Justice Department in Brazil, the sixth most populous country in the world, the most important country in South America.
[00:14:14.868 --> 00:14:15.448]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:14:16.701 --> 00:14:17.882]  Because we have the same enemy.
[00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:20.505]  People are like, why do you care about Australia being under tyranny?
[00:14:20.606 --> 00:14:21.627]  Same people are attacking them.
[00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.329]  Why do you care about Mexico?
[00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:24.330]  Same people are attacking them.
[00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.531]  Why do you care about Brazil?
[00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:27.093]  Same people are attacking them.
[00:14:27.113 --> 00:14:28.455]  Why do you care about South Korea?
[00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.177]  Why do you care about South Africa?
[00:14:30.237 --> 00:14:31.078]  Why do you care about Germany?
[00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:34.081]  It's the same New World Order, the same people!
[00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.644]  Again, if Martians pulled up,
[00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:46.060]  And a huge flying saucer vaporized Moscow, or vaporized Mexico City, or Durban, South Africa.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:51.302]  I would be just as upset if they vaporized Dallas, because it means they're coming for you next!
[00:14:51.602 --> 00:14:52.562]  Holy Toledo!
[00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:57.644]  That is what empathy is all about.
[00:15:01.886 --> 00:15:03.546]  So, and then we have the Haiti thing.
[00:15:04.087 --> 00:15:04.807]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:15:06.227 --> 00:15:14.417]  I have, I even stopped posting them on X because I can't have my whole feed just be Pennsylvania, but we're going to create some big articles that will boil down, so if you want to see it all.
[00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:16.859]  We have Haitians sacrificing cats.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.326]  We have Haitians grabbing new videos, cats out of front yards, biting their necks open and drinking the blood.
[00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:24.028]  We have Haitians doing
[00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:33.988]  Instructional videos on how to properly skull the cat's fur off and then clean that off and then how to roast it over an open fire properly.
[00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:37.471]  We have Haitians trying to kidnap little girls on video.
[00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:40.014]  We have people saving them.
[00:15:40.234 --> 00:15:44.578]  I mean, I... The feeds are so huge because everybody's just showing it.
[00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:46.100]  It is bedlam.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.982]  It's like zombie apocalypse.
[00:15:49.218 --> 00:16:00.525]  A town of 36,000 has 20,000, mainly military-age men, dropped on them with free money, out of the sky, and Haiti is literally 90% devil worshipper.
[00:16:02.066 --> 00:16:06.669]  And you got all these Haitians that are Christians, warning, saying, you don't want the devil worshippers.
[00:16:08.831 --> 00:16:11.553]  And Christian Haitians are great citizens, we have the statistics.
[00:16:12.273 --> 00:16:14.274]  Funny, the devil worshippers aren't.
[00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:17.917]  I mean, little kids,
[00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.113]  With the Haitians literally coming and sniffing their necks and grabbing on them like Joe Biden.
[00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:26.416]  And people saving the little kids.
[00:16:26.656 --> 00:16:29.819]  I mean, this is getting hard core.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.941]  And it just go, oh, but that doesn't matter.
[00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:37.205]  Loomer Maga Love, MTG calls Don in rage.
[00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:39.527]  Chibble War escalates.
[00:16:39.547 --> 00:16:40.948]  Wonder who claimed that?
[00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:45.252]  Wonder who of the two made this an issue to be in the news?
[00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:47.794]  Hmm.
[00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:50.575]  I wonder who's doing this for publicity stunt.
[00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:52.576]  I wonder who's talking to the media behind the scenes.
[00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:56.698]  I wonder who's putting themselves out there to become famous.
[00:16:57.798 --> 00:16:58.219]  I don't know.
[00:16:58.499 --> 00:16:59.539]  We ought to find out, huh?
[00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:06.602]  So... I can tell you it's not MTG.
[00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:11.845]  So... Couldn't be Laura.
[00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:15.766]  So I wonder... I wonder who it is around Trump doing it.
[00:17:15.906 --> 00:17:16.867]  We better get to the bottom of that.
[00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:19.465]  Cause I don't like troublemaking, man.
[00:17:20.725 --> 00:17:28.748]  We sure as hell, we need to find about the 325,000 kids that are missing, many in sex slavery and in slave labor, which is admitted.
[00:17:28.828 --> 00:17:30.369]  Oh, but that doesn't matter.
[00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:33.490]  Somebody told the press there's a cat fight going on.
[00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:34.791]  Wonder who did that?
[00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:43.263]  God Almighty.
[00:17:43.883 --> 00:17:44.884]  And it just goes on.
[00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.486]  Financial numbers are in.
[00:17:47.806 --> 00:17:50.309]  Prices are exploding at record level, despite what we were told.
[00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:55.273]  Of course, all the claims of prices lowering some and inflation lowering and employment being high.
[00:17:55.773 --> 00:17:57.595]  All fake, fake, fake.
[00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:02.079]  Okay, so I just spent 18 minutes telling you some.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.842]  I probably told you 5% of what's in the stacks.
[00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:07.964]  So I'm going to be disciplined.
[00:18:09.845 --> 00:18:10.066]  And I
[00:18:12.622 --> 00:18:13.502]  I'm gonna go through it now.
[00:18:14.743 --> 00:18:17.685]  But I just want listeners to hear me, please, on my knees.
[00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.666]  You need to have a total sense of urgency.
[00:18:20.686 --> 00:18:24.748]  You need to be praying, in my view, at least three, four times a day on your knees, and I'm doing it.
[00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:29.071]  And you need to be absolutely seeking God's discernment.
[00:18:31.072 --> 00:18:40.677]  We gotta direct us through this, and you better be kissing your children, and your wife, your husband, a lot extra, and you better be thanking God for every moment we've got.
[00:18:41.707 --> 00:18:56.394]  Before total economic collapse, civil war, martial law, truck bombs, false flag attacks, power outages, World War III, nuclear war, the whole global system of financial fraud, the bubble has already popped.
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:19:02.877]  The central bankers need to force us onto a new system that's even more enslaving to get themselves out of hot water.
[00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:07.199]  They're cornered rats, and they intend to take us with them.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.281]  So, they tried to kill Trump,
[00:19:13.334 --> 00:19:14.315]  On July 13th.
[00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:15.136]  Guys, look up the numbers.
[00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:16.076]  How many days ago was that?
[00:19:16.477 --> 00:19:17.017]  What, two months?
[00:19:17.738 --> 00:19:18.038]  Roughly?
[00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:19.139]  See if I'm right.
[00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:20.921]  I think it was exactly two months ago.
[00:19:22.322 --> 00:19:23.142]  Yeah.
[00:19:23.182 --> 00:19:24.784]  So, two months ago they did that.
[00:19:24.884 --> 00:19:25.845]  It's not a Netflix show.
[00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:27.586]  It's not World of Warcraft.
[00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:29.708]  It's not Call of Duty.
[00:19:29.748 --> 00:19:30.949]  It's not a video game.
[00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:33.451]  It's the real world on this planet.
[00:19:34.992 --> 00:19:36.774]  And I know most of you know that, but I want everybody to have it.
[00:19:36.794 --> 00:19:40.677]  I mean, even myself yesterday, I did Glenn Beck's podcast.
[00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:58.007]  Did a bunch of other great shows, and they're at the Blaze, the three of them, and I was on with Miss Gonzales' great talk show, it was really smart, and she was pointing out, people aren't making a big enough deal about this.
[00:19:58.027 --> 00:20:01.170]  They think it's just something that happened in the past, and no, it's happening now.
[00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.992]  They're going to try to kill him again, because they know he's going to win.
[00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.435]  So yes, it's two months today.
[00:20:07.515 --> 00:20:08.256]  Alright, so I nailed it.
[00:20:10.424 --> 00:20:11.604]  And now we know it's a total standout.
[00:20:11.924 --> 00:20:13.905]  Everything I told you the day of the event has now been admitted.
[00:20:14.365 --> 00:20:15.285]  Of course they stood down.
[00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:17.026]  Of course they lied to Congress.
[00:20:17.306 --> 00:20:20.027]  And of course they're suppressing what really happened to even the Senate.
[00:20:21.127 --> 00:20:28.389]  And the Senate's backing away from this because they know that the whistleblowers are already telling Congress what happened, and it's insane.
[00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:36.631]  And I know what happened, and I've been asked not to talk about it yet, so that the people on Capitol Hill can break it, and so the investigators can break it.
[00:20:37.588 --> 00:21:02.076]  But let's just say, good guys in Army Special Operations, and good guys in one of the larger known military contractor groups, and good guys inside the Secret Service, FBI, you name it, have all the receipts, and the local police, and it's all being put together, and I'm just telling these people, because they're getting more, more, more, more, more by the minute, the Democrats just came out and said they're totally screwed, they know you got them.
[00:21:02.676 --> 00:21:04.116]  You already got enough cards to win.
[00:21:04.236 --> 00:21:05.196]  Play them now, man!
[00:21:05.236 --> 00:21:06.537]  We don't have time here!
[00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:08.555]  It's like hunting.
[00:21:08.616 --> 00:21:10.337]  You see that deer go out between the spaces?
[00:21:11.097 --> 00:21:12.278]  You got 10 yards to get him.
[00:21:12.318 --> 00:21:13.139]  You're on target.
[00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:13.859]  Don't hesitate.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.340]  Pull the trigger.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.221]  And I don't mean kill anybody.
[00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:16.861]  That's a metaphor.
[00:21:17.462 --> 00:21:19.343]  But you better not hesitate.
[00:21:19.383 --> 00:21:19.843]  Relax.
[00:21:20.223 --> 00:21:20.784]  Pull the trigger.
[00:21:23.045 --> 00:21:26.308]  I've been telling Trump for a month, pull the trigger on the 325,000 missing.
[00:21:26.348 --> 00:21:27.388]  Say you're gonna find them.
[00:21:27.408 --> 00:21:28.909]  Say you're gonna prosecute who did it.
[00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.951]  And he is.
[00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:32.552]  Unify the people.
[00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:41.322]  One thing Trump did that was wrong in the debate is they would challenge his crowd sizes and, you know, attack him personally.
[00:21:41.362 --> 00:21:43.082]  And he still, he used to be really mad about it.
[00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:44.403]  He still took the bait.
[00:21:44.443 --> 00:21:55.587]  I mean, listen, I didn't start this show with Extra and Dateline and ABC News all attacking me last night.
[00:21:56.368 --> 00:21:57.848]  And that's just what I know about.
[00:21:58.349 --> 00:21:59.989]  Did I start the show with that?
[00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:01.670]  I'm only telling you about it because
[00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:04.062]  It's an example.
[00:22:04.102 --> 00:22:04.843]  Did I start the show?
[00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:07.644]  Oh, Bill Gates attacked me last night with Oprah Winfrey.
[00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:09.744]  They've got the clip.
[00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:11.625]  I haven't even watched it because it's not important.
[00:22:13.386 --> 00:22:15.207]  They got the clips of me being attacked on everything else.
[00:22:15.227 --> 00:22:16.307]  They're like, hey, you want to run this?
[00:22:16.387 --> 00:22:17.708]  No, I don't think so.
[00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:21.329]  Ain't about Laura Loomer and MTG.
[00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:23.950]  Ain't about Alex Jones getting attacked by Bill Gates.
[00:22:27.651 --> 00:22:28.952]  They had some celebration on
[00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.851]  Extra or whatever it is they got in there.
[00:22:31.891 --> 00:22:35.972]  Like, the two years after Jones lost the lawsuit, they called it a celebration.
[00:22:36.332 --> 00:22:37.253]  Didn't lose a lawsuit.
[00:22:37.573 --> 00:22:38.493]  Judges found me guilty.
[00:22:40.574 --> 00:22:42.455]  It's to intimidate everybody.
[00:22:42.575 --> 00:22:43.915]  I'm intimidated by World War III.
[00:22:43.955 --> 00:22:44.656]  I want to stop it.
[00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:46.196]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:22:47.957 --> 00:22:51.138]  It's interesting and we have time later, you know, we'll at the end of the show or something.
[00:22:51.158 --> 00:22:57.861]  But this is not, this is not how big a talk show host I am or, you know, how much my name can be in the newspaper.
[00:22:57.961 --> 00:22:59.902]  I don't give a rat's ass about that.
[00:23:03.777 --> 00:23:13.959]  You understand that they have announced two days ago that thousands of cruise missiles are being delivered, giant ones.
[00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:20.640]  Some of them, 2,000, 3,000 pound munitions that they can, again, shoot through your window.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.062]  They can shoot them from thousands of miles away and hit a Volkswagen Beetle in the windshield.
[00:23:28.642 --> 00:23:29.982]  They can shoot it into a windshield.
[00:23:31.032 --> 00:23:34.515]  They can shoot some of these missiles, literally, if you bend over, they can shoot it up your ass.
[00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:35.236]  She's my French.
[00:23:36.357 --> 00:23:38.759]  You open your mouth up, they can have the missile coming right in your mouth.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.841]  The cone, right in there.
[00:23:42.763 --> 00:23:43.404]  Okay?
[00:23:43.744 --> 00:23:45.466]  They can drop bombs on postage stamps.
[00:23:46.507 --> 00:23:46.927]  Seriously.
[00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:49.990]  They can have the nose of a missile come into a postage stamp.
[00:23:51.616 --> 00:24:00.503]  You watch the Israelis with their missiles that they shoot from 10 miles away and it'll go right in the window of the car, right through the perfectly, perfectly in the roof, right dead center to a postage stamp.
[00:24:01.304 --> 00:24:02.885]  They knew that from thousands of miles away as well.
[00:24:04.387 --> 00:24:07.850]  And Putin's like, okay, you've announced you're already giving the guidance to the Ukrainians.
[00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.151]  Now you're going to hit us from Europe with these damn things.
[00:24:10.432 --> 00:24:13.554]  All right, we're going to hit European targets and the Russians will do it, people.
[00:24:14.735 --> 00:24:17.438]  My God, Hitler killed 26 million of them.
[00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:19.292]  Did you know that?
[00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:23.534]  And of the Germans that were killed, 24 million?
[00:24:24.674 --> 00:24:28.036]  The Russians are estimated to have killed 22 million.
[00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:28.996]  That's right, the U.S.
[00:24:29.036 --> 00:24:32.137]  only killed 2 million, along with the, quote, allies.
[00:24:32.477 --> 00:24:34.758]  The Russians killed and beat Hitler.
[00:24:36.499 --> 00:24:39.720]  So, if you want to get in World War III, you pick the right people.
[00:24:40.956 --> 00:24:42.137]  Same thing with Napoleon Bonaparte.
[00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:42.998]  They kicked his ass.
[00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:45.100]  And they will die en masse.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.001]  And that's the whole point about it.
[00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:48.062]  They will fight you.
[00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:49.363]  They will fight to the death.
[00:24:49.784 --> 00:24:58.911]  I mean, it's like climbing into a giant gorilla's nest and going over and slapping it in the face.
[00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:01.594]  And a lot of gorillas, at first, will look at you and wonder why you're doing it.
[00:25:02.214 --> 00:25:07.359]  But in a minute, they'll just get up and pull your head off and throw your carcass in the ditch.
[00:25:08.692 --> 00:25:10.994]  So, or it's equivalent of a grizzly bear.
[00:25:11.014 --> 00:25:12.235]  That's usually the Russian analogy.
[00:25:12.875 --> 00:25:18.039]  Let's just go up to a giant grizzly bear and then just start punching it in the nose.
[00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:19.600]  That's a really good idea.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.442]  We're like, well, we'll just blow them off the map.
[00:25:21.662 --> 00:25:24.724]  They'll blow us off the map, you damn morons!
[00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:28.167]  And I'm not calling our listeners damn morons.
[00:25:28.287 --> 00:25:31.329]  I mean Kamala and Biden constantly on vacation.
[00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:32.710]  Oh, we can't send F-16s.
[00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.411]  We can't send tanks.
[00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:33.991]  That's World War III.
[00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:34.531]  It'll escalate.
[00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:36.233]  And now it has escalated.
[00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:44.653]  And these psychotic maniacs, I've got Politico and Axios right here, are licking their lips.
[00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:45.714]  Oh, Putin's in trouble.
[00:25:46.034 --> 00:25:51.499]  As early as this weekend, the bombardment of Moscow with heavy missiles is going to begin.
[00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:56.824]  Oh, that'll be wonderful when they send in a missile that blows up a whole city block.
[00:25:57.998 --> 00:26:07.024]  When you see 20-story buildings falling, that's gonna, they'll think, because they can knock out a building, they'll fly it right into the bottom of a building, just like you saw in Gaza, and you'll see.
[00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:14.509]  What do you think the Russians are gonna do when the United States and NATO start making major Russian cities?
[00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:18.372]  And they're gonna hit military bases in the cities, they're gonna hit the airfields.
[00:26:18.392 --> 00:26:22.315]  They've already said, oh, we're gonna hit the airfields where their strategic nuclear weapons are.
[00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:23.716]  We're gonna hit their bombers.
[00:26:25.043 --> 00:26:34.589]  What do you think the Russians are going to do when four or five cruise missiles come into one of their strategic air bases and they have nuclear weapons stored at them?
[00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:37.911]  Well, what do you think the Russians are going to do when their nuclear arsenal starts getting attacked?
[00:26:39.212 --> 00:26:53.556]  They're going to fire tactical nuclear weapons into Europe from where the missiles came from, and then five minutes later, Europe is going to hit them with heavier missiles, and 30 minutes later, you're going to have submarine-launched missiles vaporizing major U.S.
[00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:53.917]  cities.
[00:26:54.277 --> 00:26:55.517]  Within 30 minutes!
[00:26:56.437 --> 00:26:58.778]  Within 30 minutes, the end of the world!
[00:26:59.058 --> 00:27:02.019]  All because we have demons running things that want to screw kids.
[00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:04.680]  And the Russians say, you're not going to rape our children.
[00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:08.043]  Remember 15 years ago, Putin's crazy.
[00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:10.444]  He banned children being shipped to the U.S.
[00:27:10.684 --> 00:27:11.744]  He says that the U.S.
[00:27:11.984 --> 00:27:13.865]  is selling them into sex slavery and raping them.
[00:27:14.345 --> 00:27:18.186]  Nightline, CNN, 60 Minutes, the Russians are crazy.
[00:27:18.447 --> 00:27:23.008]  They say pedophile rings are screwing the Russian kids, and they were screwing the Russian kids.
[00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:28.770]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.171]  Let's talk about Laura Loomer and MTG.
[00:27:33.516 --> 00:27:37.921]  And I know who's doing this, and I'm not, I just, stop it!
[00:27:39.423 --> 00:27:46.091]  Stop leaking to the press that you're, you know, and there's a fight with which girls like more by Trump like we're in junior high.
[00:27:46.992 --> 00:27:48.294]  Do we like Sally or Jenny?
[00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:49.835]  I'm gonna throw up.
[00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:51.492]  Jesus Christ.
[00:27:51.812 --> 00:27:52.292]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:52.312 --> 00:27:52.713]  Stay with us.

[00:28:53.247 --> 00:28:58.488]  To be completely frank, all of this other news is completely overshadowed by the World War III developments.
[00:28:59.228 --> 00:29:07.511]  I know there's a normalcy bias that since nuclear weapons were developed in the mid-1940s that, you know, we're not really going to use them, everything's okay, the Cold War's over.
[00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:08.451]  No!
[00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:19.995]  The International Atomic Scientist Organization, all the major think tanks, the Pentagon admits we're closest to nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:29:20.015 --> 00:29:24.218]  And I don't need to go read what they say, I can tell you.
[00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:35.147]  So I'm gonna hit the nuclear war news, and at this point, we've allowed the criminals to steal the election, we've allowed the EU to take over and set up total tyranny, it's all the same globalist group.
[00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:51.400]  And they started the war 11 years ago, overthrown the Ukrainian government, stirring stuff up, an ongoing civil war, and moving weapons up to the edge of Russia and saying they were going to bring Ukraine into NATO, where Russia was founded.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.781]  And so the Russians went in.
[00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:14.003]  A little over two and a half years ago, and they've taken the area they wanted, they've defeated NATO, and so NATO keeps escalating and now has shipped thousands of heavy cruise missiles and other missiles guided by US and Western satellites and troops to be directed, aimed, and fired by our criminal governments at the Russians.
[00:30:15.765 --> 00:30:18.567]  And the Russians have said, and Putin has said, we'll play a clip in a moment,
[00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:38.576]  He very calmly talks about it, that that's a complete escalation and it is war with Russia and will be handled as such according to their threat doctrine, which means they will either use heavy missiles with conventional warheads to strike NATO supply targets even outside of Ukraine.
[00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:43.298]  They've said Poland's the first target and the Polish government has now got a globalist running it.
[00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:45.920]  Their parliament's saying don't do this and saying we don't want to be part of it.
[00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:52.155]  There's Polish troops admittedly fighting in Ukraine and that have actually gone into Russia.
[00:30:52.175 --> 00:30:52.995]  That's been confirmed.
[00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:57.939]  Remember that happened five weeks ago and it's just a blip on the radar screen.
[00:30:57.959 --> 00:31:00.602]  100 miles inside Russia.
[00:31:01.702 --> 00:31:04.044]  There's an invasion of Russia going on.
[00:31:05.405 --> 00:31:06.626]  That's just back in the newspaper.
[00:31:08.848 --> 00:31:12.211]  And Putin has said we may hit Paris.
[00:31:12.511 --> 00:31:13.292]  We may hit London.
[00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:16.378]  They said that months ago.
[00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:20.139]  And now the White House is like, well, looks like we're going to do it.
[00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:24.220]  They just had the Secretary of State Blinken meet with Zelensky.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.520]  He had another $1.5 billion.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.380]  Zelensky said that's not enough.
[00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:29.941]  They said, we are strongly considering hitting him as early as this weekend.
[00:31:31.982 --> 00:31:34.962]  It'll probably be next week or so, but they're saying this weekend.
[00:31:35.762 --> 00:31:38.523]  Russian targets, they say all of Russia is open for targeting.
[00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:41.162]  Maybe they'll have U.S.
[00:31:41.202 --> 00:31:48.267]  submarines in the Pacific Ocean, you know, hit Eastern Russia, or what you call Western Russia, in part, over by, depending on which angle you look at, over by Japan.
[00:31:50.528 --> 00:31:53.771]  So, here's some of the headlines, and I'll play the Putin clip.
[00:31:54.651 --> 00:31:55.692]  World War III bombshell.
[00:31:55.712 --> 00:32:03.138]  Putin says Russia will consider NATO officially involved in Ukraine war if storm shadow missiles use a strike inside Russia.
[00:32:03.178 --> 00:32:04.299]  The parts are made in the U.S.
[00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:08.762]  The explosives are put in in England, and then they're shipped into Poland.
[00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:11.230]  ...in other areas and start raining down on Russia.
[00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:19.652]  They're already... ...been hitting... ...areas on the border with Russia... ...and areas in Crimea.
[00:32:21.633 --> 00:32:23.374]  Friday live, Putin draws the line in the sand.
[00:32:23.414 --> 00:32:30.016]  NATO firing long-range missiles into Russia on behalf of Ukraine would spark... ...World War III.
[00:32:31.056 --> 00:32:35.838]  Putin threatens war as West prepares to lift restrictions on cruise missiles.
[00:32:38.786 --> 00:32:40.028]  Putin puts West on notice.
[00:32:40.068 --> 00:32:42.791]  Long-range arms for Ukraine will mean NATO at war with Russia.
[00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:44.353]  Declaration of war.
[00:32:45.134 --> 00:32:47.237]  Russia says that's an official declaration of war.
[00:32:47.578 --> 00:32:50.922]  They will consider themselves at war with NATO and the United States.
[00:32:51.563 --> 00:32:54.867]  Boy, that's a wonderful idea right before the election.
[00:32:54.907 --> 00:32:55.768]  Isn't that funny?
[00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.892]  And the Democrats are saying we'll have civil war conditions if Trump wins.
[00:33:00.392 --> 00:33:01.413]  They already tried to kill Trump.
[00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:03.675]  Are you figuring out the climate we're in?
[00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:07.118]  It's like the edge of a hurricane hits and the winds are 100 miles an hour right now.
[00:33:07.438 --> 00:33:08.138]  They're going up to 150.
[00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:12.181]  They've already committed.
[00:33:14.903 --> 00:33:15.404]  Unbelievable.
[00:33:16.925 --> 00:33:17.966]  World War III bombshell.
[00:33:18.006 --> 00:33:22.930]  Putin says Russia will consider NATO officially involved in Ukraine war if storm shadow missiles used to strike inside Russia.
[00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:25.211]  Here's Putin saying it.
[00:33:25.231 --> 00:33:25.932]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:33:29.246 --> 00:33:34.229]  Zelensky disappointed after Blinken visit despite getting 1.5 billion more and promises to bomb Russia.
[00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:36.290]  That's just not enough for these clowns.
[00:33:39.251 --> 00:33:42.673]  Zelensky presents Blinken with plan for long-range missile strikes even inside Russia.
[00:33:42.753 --> 00:33:46.495]  Biden under pressure to adjust his policy and authorize the use of US-provided weapons.
[00:33:50.477 --> 00:33:52.699]  White House will allow Ukraine to strike deeper in Russia.
[00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:56.861]  Polish people are concerned the USA is about to start World War III.
[00:33:57.181 --> 00:33:58.722]  Top Polish MEP, Boron,
[00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.051]  Oh, Anthony Blinken visiting Poland today.
[00:34:02.152 --> 00:34:04.953]  Blinken, go home as soon as possible.
[00:34:05.093 --> 00:34:05.674]  Get lost.
[00:34:05.794 --> 00:34:06.714]  We don't want you here.
[00:34:06.795 --> 00:34:09.977]  We don't want Polish people dying and fighting your wars.
[00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:10.837]  Uh, yeah.
[00:34:11.618 --> 00:34:12.318]  We don't want it either.
[00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:14.199]  War's like 80% unpopular.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.760]  200 plus billion.
[00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:22.104]  Meanwhile, the last time Harris headed over there two and a half years ago, three days later, Putin invaded.
[00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:25.627]  What a clown show, man.
[00:34:26.107 --> 00:34:27.268]  So this is how it all ends.
[00:34:28.068 --> 00:34:28.609]  With thunderous
[00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:30.409]  Nuclear explosions.
[00:34:34.452 --> 00:34:35.113]  Look around you.
[00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:36.394]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:44.061]  Dorothy says to Toto, Toto, I don't think, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
[00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:45.903]  No, no, you're not.
[00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:50.507]  This is so crazy.
[00:34:50.687 --> 00:34:52.188]  I'm pinching myself like it's a nightmare.
[00:34:52.328 --> 00:34:53.810]  I can't even believe this.
[00:34:59.213 --> 00:35:00.255]  And wait till you get the other news.
[00:35:00.315 --> 00:35:01.856]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:35:02.077 --> 00:35:05.321]  Of course they caught the Democrats in a legal voting scheme with the Haitians.
[00:35:05.341 --> 00:35:06.322]  That's the whole point.
[00:35:07.163 --> 00:35:09.446]  And they found it, and it's all certified.
[00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.348]  And it just came out in a report.
[00:35:12.535 --> 00:35:16.737]  Ohio Election Integrity Unit discovers illegal Haitian voter registration fraud operation.
[00:35:17.257 --> 00:35:17.737]  Oh, really?
[00:35:18.717 --> 00:35:19.238]  Think so?
[00:35:20.298 --> 00:35:24.700]  And I have so many videos, I can't even watch them all, of them roasting cats, drinking their blood.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.260]  New videos.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.881]  Not the woman in the parking lot of the people's house.
[00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:30.782]  Police woman, she's like, got a bloody cat.
[00:35:31.702 --> 00:35:32.162]  Sucking his blood.
[00:35:32.182 --> 00:35:34.823]  I've got up close in the light, like, here's how we worship Satan.
[00:35:35.324 --> 00:35:36.384]  Bite the neck out of the cat.
[00:35:36.864 --> 00:35:38.585]  He starts sucking the blood out, it's all over him.
[00:35:40.532 --> 00:35:42.913]  Roasting cats over fires.
[00:35:44.654 --> 00:35:47.935]  I mean, I don't want to show you this and people are all upset about when they see it.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:49.296]  Well, it's going on.
[00:35:49.336 --> 00:35:50.177]  Don't you want to stop it?
[00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:55.439]  Gotta see a baby getting cut up during an abortion and it's brains vacuumed out.
[00:35:56.219 --> 00:35:57.660]  Or they keep it alive for organ harvesting.
[00:35:58.721 --> 00:36:00.121]  Yeah, we stop standing up for life.
[00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:05.164]  And the Haitians, 90% are devil worshippers.
[00:36:05.244 --> 00:36:07.385]  You can go by country, by religion.
[00:36:07.705 --> 00:36:08.005]  Voodoo.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.581]  They don't just eat your cat for the meat.
[00:36:13.621 --> 00:36:15.983]  They do it because it's devil worship.
[00:36:17.404 --> 00:36:20.886]  Yeah, there's WBNS TV CBS.
[00:36:20.986 --> 00:36:25.209]  Oh, the National News says it's not real, but there they are, Ohio woman arrested for allegedly eating cat.
[00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.052]  That was out four days before the debate.
[00:36:30.953 --> 00:36:32.134]  They said, why'd you eat the cat?
[00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:33.955]  She just snarls at him and shows her teeth.
[00:36:36.597 --> 00:36:37.658]  Oh, very nice.
[00:36:38.378 --> 00:36:39.319]  Aren't you a nice lady?
[00:36:42.073 --> 00:36:46.154]  We got them grabbing people's kids off the street, killing people's kids, running over them.
[00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:50.475]  And when they do, the father comes out and says, how dare you use my son for political stuff?
[00:36:51.135 --> 00:36:53.155]  I wish a white man killed my kid.
[00:36:53.395 --> 00:36:53.916]  White people.
[00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:54.696]  It's a white guy.
[00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:56.396]  His liberal wife's nodding, crying.
[00:36:56.436 --> 00:36:57.436]  Yes, you did it to us.
[00:36:57.476 --> 00:36:58.416]  You're the one.
[00:36:58.456 --> 00:36:58.877]  Stop it!
[00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.817]  No, your kid got killed.
[00:37:00.877 --> 00:37:02.477]  We have a community right to be concerned about it.
[00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:05.998]  And you're being political about it because you got Stockholm syndrome.
[00:37:06.018 --> 00:37:06.998]  You've been brainwashed.
[00:37:07.498 --> 00:37:08.439]  And I'm sad for you.
[00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:09.879]  But holy Toledo.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.401]  Okay, let's get back to where I was.
[00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:18.883]  So, this is the climate where you get World War III.
[00:37:18.923 --> 00:37:19.964]  Totally open borders.
[00:37:20.644 --> 00:37:23.326]  They're focusing on one town in Ohio.
[00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.546]  This is happening all over the place.
[00:37:25.227 --> 00:37:27.008]  We got Haitians in Austin running around.
[00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:32.371]  It's in the news, but it mainly makes the community, you know, sights.
[00:37:32.831 --> 00:37:38.154]  If you go down on South Lamar, right where the Alamo Draft House is, I've seen him twice.
[00:37:38.694 --> 00:37:41.876]  I was taking my daughter out to dinner, my oldest daughter, a month ago, Charlotte.
[00:37:43.154 --> 00:37:47.915]  She wanted me to take her to an Italian restaurant, wanted some daddy time, because I hadn't taken her out to a restaurant alone in probably six months.
[00:37:48.835 --> 00:37:52.316]  So I went and picked her up at her condo, and we went and got some food together.
[00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.317]  And she goes, oh my god, that's him!
[00:37:54.337 --> 00:37:58.318]  I've been seeing him on the local community notes, and it hit the newspaper.
[00:37:58.518 --> 00:37:58.938]  That's him!
[00:37:58.978 --> 00:37:59.778]  And she pulls it up, it's the guy.
[00:37:59.798 --> 00:38:01.219]  It's like this big, tall, 6'4", Haitian.
[00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:08.082]  And he wears like a loincloth and he's just walking, he was carrying like a big radiator of an air conditioner down the street looking all crazy.
[00:38:08.502 --> 00:38:13.785]  And he just goes around and robs and rapes and beats women and attacks people and nothing's done.
[00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:17.327]  And women are getting out of their cars, he runs out of the green belt, grabs them, rapes them.
[00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.828]  And when we saw him, and I go, should I call 911?
[00:38:19.988 --> 00:38:21.129]  He goes, no, let's just go home.
[00:38:21.189 --> 00:38:23.470]  I probably should have, but it's like, I had a gun in the glove compartment.
[00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:29.814]  I'm just like, it's just the normal thing of some giant Haitian dude, like zombie, with like a radiator of an air conditioner.
[00:38:32.065 --> 00:38:34.617]  Right where she wanted me to take me to eat food.
[00:38:38.075 --> 00:38:41.816]  And it's just all the community notes and, you know, all the reports of women being sexually assaulted.
[00:38:41.836 --> 00:38:46.137]  A lot of it, he just runs up to a woman, his target's women, just beats them on the head with a club.
[00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:48.598]  Doesn't even rob them, just beats them sometimes, he robs them.
[00:38:49.018 --> 00:38:51.318]  And he just talks around, just foaming at the mouth.
[00:38:51.578 --> 00:38:56.780]  And then you'll see some crazy-looking Muslim woman with big hoods on out there, and you're just driving along.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.781]  There's another crazy, there's another crazy, there's another crazy.
[00:39:00.321 --> 00:39:03.442]  You'll see a whole corner of, like, Guatemalans, their little Guatemalan outfits.
[00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:05.002]  You're just like, what the hell's going on around here?
[00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.812]  I mean, I could go out in 30 minutes, come back with all the footage of this kind of craziness.
[00:39:10.352 --> 00:39:11.833]  Oh, and you ought to drive around at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:39:12.793 --> 00:39:13.674]  Or 7 in the morning!
[00:39:13.694 --> 00:39:16.235]  People just foaming at the mouth, running around.
[00:39:17.896 --> 00:39:22.518]  Crazy white dude with his eyes all wild with a baseball bat, ran out in front of my car, almost hit him last week, two weeks ago.
[00:39:22.938 --> 00:39:29.662]  Just foaming at the mouth with his shirt off, with a baseball bat, looked at my car going, and then ran back across the street.
[00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:31.142]  Just normal.
[00:39:31.162 --> 00:39:32.242]  Everything's fine.
[00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.204]  And the government wants nuclear war.
[00:39:34.304 --> 00:39:35.825]  It's about to start bombing Russia inside.
[00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:36.546]  It's just no big deal.
[00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:37.006]  Everything's fine.
[00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:39.488]  And there's 325,000 missing kids, many in sex slavery.
[00:39:39.508 --> 00:39:40.910]  New York Times admits it.
[00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:41.670]  Just no big deal.
[00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.791]  Who even cares where they are?
[00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:43.652]  Just everything's fine.
[00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:48.596]  Yeah, remember all those big giant Haitian camps?
[00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:49.997]  They're down there right now in South Texas.
[00:39:50.017 --> 00:39:51.198]  They just build up every day.
[00:39:51.218 --> 00:39:51.198]  10, 20,000.
[00:39:51.278 --> 00:39:52.019]  They let them in.
[00:39:52.039 --> 00:39:52.579]  They just ship them in.
[00:39:57.518 --> 00:39:58.178]  10 to 1 men.
[00:39:58.358 --> 00:40:01.439]  For every 10 men, you find a woman or a kid or something, just like on the video right here.
[00:40:02.339 --> 00:40:02.979]  Almost all men.
[00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:03.779]  You know, there's a little kid.
[00:40:03.799 --> 00:40:05.740]  There's another little kid.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.080]  They're here.
[00:40:12.321 --> 00:40:13.041]  So there you go.
[00:40:15.522 --> 00:40:16.462]  Think they're eating cats?
[00:40:18.002 --> 00:40:19.202]  There's a bear shit in the woods?
[00:40:23.803 --> 00:40:25.164]  Would you like to see a couple hours of this?
[00:40:25.984 --> 00:40:26.884]  We got footage of it too.
[00:40:29.847 --> 00:40:35.191]  And you look at these camps, we flew drones over and it'll go for like a mile or two, just camp, camp, camp, camp.
[00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:45.338]  Then they put them in the big UN camp, get them all brainwashed, give them cell phones, 90 cards, and free multi-thousand dollar debit cards and say, go here, you go here, here's a bus, here's a plane.
[00:40:46.438 --> 00:40:47.099]  Who's this kid?
[00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:48.320]  I just took the kid with me.
[00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:52.923]  You'll have some guy, an Arab of a totally different race, like a Latin American three-year-old.
[00:40:53.143 --> 00:40:54.084]  No, you can just keep him.
[00:40:54.444 --> 00:40:55.124]  Okay, thanks.
[00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.747]  Just total, complete bedlam.
[00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:04.796]  Hit in California, hit in Arizona, hit in Texas, just everywhere, but it doesn't matter.
[00:41:04.816 --> 00:41:05.356]  Everything's fine.
[00:41:11.299 --> 00:41:14.240]  So, let's go ahead now and play Putin.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.220]  There's closed captioning.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.061]  I will read over it for radio listeners.
[00:41:19.302 --> 00:41:20.243]  We have an English version.
[00:41:20.323 --> 00:41:20.983]  Wow, great job.
[00:41:21.003 --> 00:41:25.565]  Let's go ahead and play the very calm, chilling statement that Russia will be officially at war with the U.S.
[00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:29.967]  and NATO if one of the missiles that's being guided and delivered by the West hits
[00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:33.500]  Russia and they're announcing, oh we're gonna bomb targets all over Russia.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.020]  Here it is.
[00:41:34.801 --> 00:41:45.590]  Recently we've seen and heard discussions at high levels in the UK and US about allowing the Kiev regime to strike deep into Russian territory with Western long-range weapons.
[00:41:47.932 --> 00:41:51.696]  It seems this decision is either imminent or has already been made.
[00:41:52.875 --> 00:41:55.476]  These are certainly extraordinary developments.
[00:41:56.157 --> 00:42:01.159]  I'd like to ask you to comment on what's happening as an attempt to substitute concepts.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.403]  We're not talking about permitting or prohibiting Kiev from striking Russian territory.
[00:42:13.245 --> 00:42:20.689]  They already do so with drones and other means, but using Western-made long-range precision weapons is a completely different story.
[00:42:22.648 --> 00:42:33.697]  As I've said before, and experts on both sides will confirm, the Ukrainian army is incapable of conducting strikes with modern, western, high-precision, long-range systems.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.341]  She can't do that.
[00:42:40.303 --> 00:42:43.826]  This is only possible with satellite intel that Ukraine doesn't have.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.722]  It's data from EU or US satellites, basically NATO satellites.
[00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:58.143]  That's the first point.
[00:42:58.643 --> 00:43:04.166]  Second, and crucially, only NATO military can input flight missions for these systems.
[00:43:05.506 --> 00:43:07.067]  Ukrainian soldiers can't do this.
[00:43:09.808 --> 00:43:13.149]  So it's not about letting Ukraine strike Russia with these weapons.
[00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:18.351]  It's about deciding if NATO countries are directly involved in the conflict.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.383]  If they decide yes, it means NATO, US and European countries are in the war in Ukraine.
[00:43:32.787 --> 00:43:34.068]  That's direct involvement.
[00:43:35.208 --> 00:43:38.090]  This drastically changes the nature of the conflict.
[00:43:42.112 --> 00:43:45.954]  It would mean NATO, US and European countries are at war with Russia.
[00:43:48.883 --> 00:43:52.384]  If so, given this change, we'll respond based on the threats we face.
[00:44:01.947 --> 00:44:05.429]  And he goes on to say that we'll be at war, which you basically already said.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:07.529]  That's what the Russian foreign ministry has said.
[00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.470]  So, that's where we are.
[00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:19.637]  The globalists don't have a choice.
[00:44:20.598 --> 00:44:22.319]  Their financial system is coming to an end.
[00:44:22.339 --> 00:44:24.480]  They want to put us on the new central bank digital currency.
[00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:28.903]  The social credit score that comes with that has been officially announced for years, but now they're officially implementing it.
[00:44:29.504 --> 00:44:36.148]  And they need to have a big crisis to get us all in line, not just here but around the world, for tyranny.
[00:44:36.548 --> 00:44:41.472]  And when they hit Iran, or Iran gets involved and activates its sleeper cells, Hezbollah's everywhere,
[00:44:42.878 --> 00:44:45.380]  Just like with 9-11, they won't lose their rights.
[00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.202]  They'll bring in more Muslims.
[00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:48.603]  You will lose your rights.
[00:44:49.865 --> 00:44:53.128]  And they will bring in permanent tyranny that's already in place, but they will expand it.
[00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:55.490]  The clamps are on, but they'll tighten.
[00:44:57.352 --> 00:44:58.593]  So this is where we are.
[00:44:58.613 --> 00:44:59.494]  Do you read about history?
[00:44:59.554 --> 00:45:03.317]  Crazy things regimes do, crazy wars, crazy invasions, crazy leadership.
[00:45:03.377 --> 00:45:04.158]  We got it right now.
[00:45:05.319 --> 00:45:08.082]  We have psychological, spiritual, cultural, military cancer.
[00:45:11.195 --> 00:45:16.858]  And we've got a bunch of elites that feel like they're insulated from all this who've built a bunch of bunkers as if they're going to survive a nuclear war.
[00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:28.303]  Those bunkers are all known by security and other people and they'll be discovered by others quickly and you will be destroyed in your bunkers.
[00:45:29.843 --> 00:45:35.366]  And a lot of the globalists know this, that's why they've been flip-flopping over to our side and trying to stop this just through rational sanity.
[00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:37.547]  Kind of like the German general staff
[00:45:39.386 --> 00:45:42.829]  A year and a half before Germany finally got overrun and lost, they knew they were going to lose.
[00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:44.831]  They didn't sue for peace or capitulate.
[00:45:44.851 --> 00:45:46.492]  Capitulate means you give up, but with conditions.
[00:45:47.273 --> 00:45:47.894]  Negotiate.
[00:45:48.554 --> 00:45:54.419]  So they tried to kill Hitler because he was actually in control, but they failed with Operation Valkyrie.
[00:45:54.439 --> 00:45:55.260]  So you know the end.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.605]  And most of the Russians and Germans that died, died in that last year and a half slugging it out.
[00:46:03.055 --> 00:46:08.937]  Over 15 million Germans would have survived, over 15 million Russians would have survived, the 26 million Russians, the 24 million Germans.
[00:46:09.857 --> 00:46:10.337]  But they didn't.
[00:46:12.378 --> 00:46:16.099]  And here, you can't go kill one person and stop, there's not like one Hitler you can go get.
[00:46:17.799 --> 00:46:28.082]  So, it's a bureaucracy of lawyers and bureaucrats and third, fourth generation diplomats like Blinken and all of them that think they're insulated from all this, and of course they're not.
[00:46:29.727 --> 00:46:34.611]  I mean, Blinken goes and, you know, plays, keep on rockin' in the free world while he's there.
[00:46:34.631 --> 00:46:39.195]  You know, goes and visits and they party while everybody's dying at the front lines.
[00:46:40.436 --> 00:46:48.383]  It's all a sick joke of a bunch of people that have never even been in a fistfight or in combat playing general.
[00:46:50.885 --> 00:46:54.107]  That's why the generals under Obama said, we can't fight Russia and Syria.
[00:46:54.147 --> 00:46:54.948]  That's World War III.
[00:46:55.328 --> 00:46:56.369]  It will immediately escalate.
[00:46:56.389 --> 00:46:56.810]  You can't do it.
[00:46:57.817 --> 00:47:01.260]  Sorry, we can't back ISIS to overthrow Assad, which was the right thing to do anyways.
[00:47:02.001 --> 00:47:02.581]  Shouldn't have done that.
[00:47:02.702 --> 00:47:04.183]  And then Trump got in and stopped it.
[00:47:06.185 --> 00:47:07.466]  And worked with Russia to shut it down.
[00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:13.171]  And later learned the military was still secretly funding ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Trump got pissed about that.
[00:47:14.572 --> 00:47:18.776]  That's why the top generals that are retired say, we can't have Trump, you know, we can't have that.
[00:47:19.517 --> 00:47:20.538]  He's against U.S.
[00:47:20.598 --> 00:47:20.818]  interests.
[00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:21.939]  No, they're against U.S.
[00:47:21.999 --> 00:47:22.199]  interests.
[00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:24.021]  They're the ones destroying our country on record.
[00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:33.361]  So, really, I should clear the decks and just open the phones up and take calls about World War III, but we need to cover the other news.
[00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:35.402]  And look, you can't beat a dead horse.
[00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:36.903]  I mean, this is where we are.
[00:47:37.423 --> 00:47:38.403]  This is what's happening.
[00:47:40.044 --> 00:47:42.125]  Criminals hijack the government through election fraud.
[00:47:43.105 --> 00:47:44.526]  They've got the Justice Department.
[00:47:44.546 --> 00:47:45.706]  They tried to kill Trump and failed.
[00:47:45.726 --> 00:47:46.867]  They've been caught covering that up.
[00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:47.947]  Now they're in deep trouble there.
[00:47:48.988 --> 00:47:53.690]  But that makes them more dangerous as everything collapses, as they try to grasp onto power.
[00:47:55.458 --> 00:48:06.648]  So to describe the moment we're in, in human history and recorded history, who knows what happened in the past, but... Because I don't know if Atlantis actually existed, but we have an Atlantean scenario now happening.
[00:48:07.528 --> 00:48:10.791]  Where our power gets so great, but we're still just humans and we blow each other up.
[00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:14.754]  Whether that happened 12,000 years ago or not, I don't know.
[00:48:15.475 --> 00:48:16.176]  But I know this.
[00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:20.195]  We're in that scenario right now.
[00:48:21.076 --> 00:48:26.782]  And I would say it's a probability, it's 100% certainty on the current course, total nuclear war.
[00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:31.426]  It is a probability that this isn't going to get turned around.
[00:48:31.986 --> 00:48:42.617]  So for the first time ever, I'm just going to tell you, not to be alarmist, just to be honest, but to raise the alarm, that it is a probability that we will have total nuclear war in the next few months.
[00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.331]  And notice we're 52 days out from the election.
[00:48:45.672 --> 00:48:46.232]  Perfect timing.
[00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:55.979]  What I've been saying the last couple years, in the few months before the election, their biggest October surprise is an October giant war.
[00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:00.002]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:49:07.341 --> 00:49:11.124]  And I'm going to come back and hit the Secret Service total collapse news.
[00:49:11.144 --> 00:49:14.266]  The Democrats have been able to cover up, saying the public's going to be shocked.
[00:49:15.087 --> 00:49:22.153]  The incredible developments in the economy, the incredible developments with the poison shots.
[00:49:23.934 --> 00:49:26.056]  Trump and some of the big campaign things he's announced.
[00:49:27.937 --> 00:49:30.019]  There's just so much coming up, second hour.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.441]  If you want to keep us on air,
[00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:34.722]  And you want to get great products.
[00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:35.743]  I need your help.
[00:49:35.963 --> 00:49:40.846]  I need you to make the decision at such a critical time to bet on the folks that have been the most successful in the fight.
[00:49:40.866 --> 00:49:42.167]  And that means the people that have backed us.
[00:49:42.287 --> 00:49:42.928]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:49:42.968 --> 00:49:43.468]  You did this.
[00:49:43.488 --> 00:49:45.409]  So I want to thank those that have supported.
[00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.570]  Encourage you to support some more.
[00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:49.332]  And I want to encourage the vast majority of you.
[00:49:50.453 --> 00:49:52.715]  We had 15 million plus and counting.
[00:49:52.775 --> 00:49:54.136]  I quit looking a few days ago.
[00:49:54.456 --> 00:49:56.137]  People that tuned in to the debate coverage here.
[00:49:56.297 --> 00:49:56.998]  Just on Exelon.
[00:49:57.018 --> 00:49:57.878]  Millions at InfoWars.
[00:49:58.999 --> 00:50:00.861]  No increase in funds came in that day.
[00:50:01.755 --> 00:50:05.398]  From the regular 5, 6, 7 million that tune into the show every day, and then tens of millions that watch clips.
[00:50:05.678 --> 00:50:05.918]  Fine.
[00:50:06.199 --> 00:50:09.301]  It's that small minority of people that want the great products that get them.
[00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:14.645]  I'm just simply asking the people that listen and watch for the tens of millions, would you just go to drjonesnaturals.com?
[00:50:14.665 --> 00:50:15.926]  Would you just go to m4short.com?
[00:50:16.287 --> 00:50:18.208]  Everybody needs a high-quality water filtration system.
[00:50:18.228 --> 00:50:19.729]  We got the highest rate at the lowest price.
[00:50:19.929 --> 00:50:20.810]  Go look at the ratings on it.
[00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.153]  Gravity Fed cuts out 3,000 plus things to non-detectable levels.
[00:50:25.454 --> 00:50:26.535]  Yep, the water's full of crap.
[00:50:26.575 --> 00:50:27.676]  That's a good thing everybody needs.
[00:50:27.716 --> 00:50:28.977]  It's the best price, best unit.

[00:50:39.775 --> 00:50:40.436]  Doesn't get you high.
[00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:41.196]  No THC.

[00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:51.414]  Next little foundational energy is about to sell out.

[00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:27.815]  I've teamed up with the folks that make a lot of the top-selling Trump shirts in the country.
[00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:29.655]  They've got the best t-shirt designers, bigly.
[00:51:30.015 --> 00:51:34.637]  If you go to thealexjonestore.com, that's separate from InfoWars, so that's key to support.
[00:51:35.117 --> 00:51:36.317]  Into the future, whatever happens here.
[00:51:37.077 --> 00:51:39.198]  They've got over 30 incredible t-shirt designs.
[00:51:39.218 --> 00:51:39.918]  I think there's more now.
[00:51:39.958 --> 00:51:43.519]  They're adding more every day at thealexjonestore.com.
[00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:45.459]  They're a designer.

[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.620]  They're all there.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.940]  Some of the InfoWars classics they updated, made even better.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.921]  A lot of new, incredible designs.
[00:51:53.012 --> 00:51:54.093]  A lot of Alex Jones shirts.
[00:51:54.113 --> 00:51:55.814]  A lot of Trump shirts.

[00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:31.951]  And these are badass shirts.
[00:52:32.791 --> 00:52:33.592]  We need your aid.
[00:52:33.612 --> 00:52:34.372]  We need your support.

[00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:36.914]  It spreads the word.
[00:52:37.234 --> 00:52:39.195]  It's exciting to wear these out in public.
[00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:40.435]  Most people will agree with you and love you.

[00:52:48.143 --> 00:52:49.888]  Oh, and there's 30 new ball caps as well.
[00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:51.132]  Oh, they're amazing.
[00:52:51.313 --> 00:52:52.236]  They're all limited edition.
[00:52:52.276 --> 00:52:52.637]  Stay with us.
[00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:59.052]  COVID vax causes more heart damage than COVID virus and brain, blood, immune cancer, reproductive study.
[00:52:59.372 --> 00:53:00.293]  I mean, there's so many of these studies.
[00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:00.873]  What do you make of that?
[00:53:00.913 --> 00:53:02.993]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[00:53:03.293 --> 00:53:09.095]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[00:53:09.475 --> 00:53:10.955]  It's a government false narrative.
[00:53:11.015 --> 00:53:16.877]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies that the infection causes myocarditis.
[00:53:17.077 --> 00:53:17.757]  It doesn't.
[00:53:17.977 --> 00:53:19.977]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:21.358]  When you follow the article, there's no link.
[00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:21.898]  There's no proof.
[00:53:21.938 --> 00:53:22.378]  It just says,
[00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:27.581]  COVID's a greater risk of heart problems than the shot, and they just lie.
[00:53:27.961 --> 00:53:35.766]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC, the NIH.
[00:53:36.606 --> 00:53:38.387]  This is a false narrative.
[00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:42.230]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:43.450]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:53:43.671 --> 00:53:47.473]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist, Alex, I am knee-deep
[00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:58.023]  In people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure, the vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias and some is inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[00:53:58.463 --> 00:54:00.986]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart, another study.
[00:54:01.366 --> 00:54:04.850]  Heart failure can be an outcome of
[00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.911]  Subclinical myocarditis.
[00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:17.475]  It's very important for people to realize they may not feel chest pain initially, but then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[00:54:17.515 --> 00:54:20.456]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[00:54:20.776 --> 00:54:23.037]  It's vaccine myocarditis and heart failure.
[00:54:23.417 --> 00:54:24.658]  They need treatment for this.
[00:54:24.978 --> 00:54:32.761]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements available through onlinehealthnow.com.
[00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:43.424]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:54:43.584 --> 00:54:52.666]  Now, I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, bad as taking the shots,
[00:54:53.632 --> 00:55:10.298]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published, you have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[00:55:10.698 --> 00:55:13.839]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[00:55:14.139 --> 00:55:18.380]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:26.463]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[00:55:26.803 --> 00:55:28.223]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[00:55:28.524 --> 00:55:32.045]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:37.786]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this, very good support for doing this.
[00:55:38.227 --> 00:55:39.387]  It's natokinase.
[00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:43.029]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:44.170]  Japanese discovered it.
[00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.372]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[00:55:48.813 --> 00:55:52.355]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[00:55:52.395 --> 00:55:54.096]  These are all in capsule format.
[00:55:54.436 --> 00:55:56.878]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[00:55:57.218 --> 00:55:59.099]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[00:55:59.179 --> 00:56:02.121]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:03.181]  So you build up?
[00:56:03.522 --> 00:56:04.242]  And we build up.
[00:56:04.282 --> 00:56:08.204]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[00:56:08.244 --> 00:56:10.406]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[00:56:10.646 --> 00:56:12.627]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners.
[00:56:12.887 --> 00:56:16.109]  And we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:20.091]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[00:56:20.292 --> 00:56:21.292]  They don't dissolve them.
[00:56:21.552 --> 00:56:27.516]  We actually have to give thrombolytic enzymes, that's McCullough protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[00:56:27.876 --> 00:56:31.758]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:32.058 --> 00:56:33.139]  That's the go-to place.
[00:56:33.159 --> 00:56:38.482]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[00:56:38.522 --> 00:56:42.104]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase but five minor ingredients.
[00:56:42.304 --> 00:56:49.568]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
[00:56:49.968 --> 00:56:51.489]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:53.596 --> 00:57:04.460]  Alright, a lot of our 300 plus radio stations don't carry this first five minutes, so I'm going to hit this right now, because what's happening to me is not as important as all the rest of this, but it's an educational format point, so I'm going to do it.
[00:57:05.961 --> 00:57:14.644]  Last night, on at least three national shows, ABC News, Extra, and one other, they attacked me and said I'm a terrible, horrible person.
[00:57:16.444 --> 00:57:17.165]  Now, why'd they do that?
[00:57:17.985 --> 00:57:20.326]  Because I'm here raising the alarm, exposing these maniacs.
[00:57:21.567 --> 00:57:23.929]  And again, they wouldn't be doing this if they were invincible.
[00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.332]  There wouldn't be all this propaganda if they were unstoppable.
[00:57:28.414 --> 00:57:30.676]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:57:30.716 --> 00:57:31.817]  It's been said a trillion times.
[00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:35.480]  But that's also what makes them so dangerous.
[00:57:36.942 --> 00:57:45.630]  So here's a clip of Oprah Winfrey from her program last night, talking about AI and other issues, talking to Bill Gates on ABC News.
[00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:48.269]  About yours truly, here it is.
[00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:57.599]  But what did we miss with the internet and social media that we can use to apply now to this moment of AI?
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:04.867]  Well, I would say, speaking for myself personally and I think many others, that we were a bit naive
[00:58:11.133 --> 00:58:16.496]  We thought the internet, the availability of information, would make us all a lot more factual.
[00:58:16.657 --> 00:58:21.980]  The fact that people would seek out kind of a niche of misinformation, we were a bit naive.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:25.522]  And bringing those lessons of, you know, let's get ahead of this.
[00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:30.384]  Let's get the politicians to be users and have a dialogue about
[00:58:32.087 --> 00:58:36.116]  Maximizing the benefits while minimizing the negatives.
[00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:40.365]  So to defend Bill Gates everybody's
[00:58:41.345 --> 00:58:51.694]  Doctor, who's really the biggest rapist in history, putting things in your body, trying to euthanize everybody and GMO your food and take away your meat, make you eat bugs, is Alex Jones and Sandy Hook.
[00:58:51.734 --> 00:58:56.218]  What's that have to do with Bill Gates and his wife leaving him because of the Jeffrey Epstein stuff, the trafficking of children?
[00:58:57.038 --> 00:59:00.902]  Or Bill Gates being banned in India because he got caught giving kids poison shots?
[00:59:01.783 --> 00:59:08.128]  Or Reuters headline, majority of polio now caused by Bill Gates' polio shots.
[00:59:08.148 --> 00:59:09.009]  You can pull that up.
[00:59:11.172 --> 00:59:15.533]  What does that have to do with me and the internet questioning a shooting that happened almost 12 years ago?
[00:59:16.453 --> 00:59:17.013]  That's all they got.
[00:59:17.113 --> 00:59:18.473]  Oh, this guy questioned something.
[00:59:18.794 --> 00:59:24.475]  It's worse than millions of Iraqis being starved to death under sanctions by the Clintons that expanded it to triple what the Bush's had.
[00:59:25.375 --> 00:59:28.275]  It's no medicine food shipped into a desert country.
[00:59:29.096 --> 00:59:29.896]  That's not a problem.
[00:59:30.196 --> 00:59:35.857]  Not hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths or 325,000 missing kids and sex slavery and slave labor.
[00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:57.479]  Or all the corruption, or World War III, or, you know, the Haitians running wild, or the Venezuelan gangs, and pedophilia being promoted, and all the rest of the globalist crimes that are going on, and the globalists trying to kill Trump, and lying about it, and coming out, the Secret Service stood down, is now engaging a massive cover-up at DHS and the Justice Department, and the Senate admitting that.
[00:59:58.139 --> 01:00:01.741]  No, it's Alex Jones and the danger of Internet disinformation
[01:00:02.341 --> 01:00:05.063]  Because the magic word, Sandy Hook, you wave a wand.
[01:00:05.364 --> 01:00:06.385]  Why, the internet didn't believe it.
[01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:07.566]  Alex Jones covered it some.
[01:00:07.826 --> 01:00:08.787]  He's the greatest devil ever.
[01:00:08.807 --> 01:00:09.948]  We gotta shut them all down.
[01:00:10.188 --> 01:00:11.189]  Bill Gates is the good guy.
[01:00:11.229 --> 01:00:13.090]  He's gonna teach us what's real and what's not.
[01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:16.854]  Why, he's got NewsGuard that goes out and tells everybody what to censor and shut down.
[01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.755]  Like, oh, these shots don't work.
[01:00:18.775 --> 01:00:19.456]  They make you sick.
[01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:20.397]  You're censored.
[01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:21.338]  That was all true.
[01:00:21.438 --> 01:00:22.339]  Came out to be true.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.661]  Everything he says is a lie.
[01:00:24.701 --> 01:00:27.964]  He runs a global depopulation eugenics operation.
[01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:35.334]  And there's Oprah Winfrey, best buddies with Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harvey Weinstein, and with Bill Gates.
[01:00:35.434 --> 01:00:36.635]  You know, he was sponsor of the show.
[01:00:36.655 --> 01:00:38.036]  He spends billions a year on media.
[01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:40.517]  AI and the future of us.
[01:00:40.817 --> 01:00:43.059]  An Oprah Winfrey special, Thursday, September 12th.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.361]  And I'm told, I haven't even watched it, they just found that one clip.
[01:00:46.782 --> 01:00:48.203]  Repeatedly, I'm the bad guy.
[01:00:48.843 --> 01:00:50.464]  Oh, play scary music.
[01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:53.866]  Oh my gosh, Alex Jones is so evil.
[01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:57.907]  He's so bad, he's gotta be stopped, but the truth's getting out here.
[01:00:57.947 --> 01:00:59.849]  I was on Glenn Beck yesterday, that's going viral.
[01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:07.198]  Everywhere else, we have bigger audiences than them, and that's why they're so scared, and why they need a World War III, or a massive cyber attack, or a civil war.
[01:01:07.238 --> 01:01:12.905]  They're saying they gotta have it, civil war conditions, if Trump wins, because they're on the ropes, they're losing, they're failing.
[01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:16.270]  Everybody hates you, Bill Gates.
[01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:23.715]  Everybody knows who you are, you biological warfare rapist, raping us with your poisons and viruses you cook up and raping us with your poison shots.
[01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:25.636]  Go to hell, Bill Gates!
[01:01:26.137 --> 01:01:26.817]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:34.422]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Friday, September 13, 2024 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:39.986]  We are 40.
[01:01:44.994 --> 01:01:46.535]  Almost 50, that's just longer than that.
[01:01:47.575 --> 01:01:53.377]  It's just about 50 years since the Vietnam War ended, and of course the United States got defeated there, but the U.S.
[01:01:53.417 --> 01:02:03.041]  doesn't need to win wars, because the people pay for it and lose our lives, and the people we're killing lose their lives, but the military-industrial complex gets more power and more control.
[01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:07.463]  And now they've moved on from the Vietnamese to the Russians.
[01:02:08.223 --> 01:02:20.717]  We've got the biggest nuclear arsenal and submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and up by the Arctic Circle with nuclear missiles, ballistic missiles pointed at us.
[01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:23.961]  Not to mention everything else they've got.
[01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:34.887]  And so now if you just joined us, Putin came out and said, if NATO starts bombing Russia with precision-guided heavy missiles, it's an act of war and Russia will act accordingly according to their doctrine.
[01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:39.850]  And their doctrine is they will hit those targets in Europe with either conventional or tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:48.734]  And then about five minutes after that, the doctrine of the United States is to have total commitment and rain missiles down on the U.S.
[01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:53.537]  So most experts believe Russia may not even just use tacticals, they'll go ahead and hit the West first.
[01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:59.948]  And in 30 minutes, the world, as you know it, is over.
[01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:05.431]  And it will take probably thousands of years for us to get back to where we are now, even if we survive.
[01:03:07.973 --> 01:03:20.200]  And the 450-plus emitted nuclear reactors will all melt down, shut down, and blow up, making the entire planet completely radioactive for billions of years.
[01:03:23.928 --> 01:03:26.229]  So are we gonna commit collective suicide?
[01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:32.911]  That's really the question that's on the table.
[01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:38.493]  And I talked to my friends and family that are awake and informed, they still don't get this.
[01:03:39.693 --> 01:03:41.614]  Oh yeah, that's cool, come on the boat this weekend.
[01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:47.896]  Hey, you better be careful, you know, going to Europe right now.
[01:03:48.376 --> 01:03:50.977]  Oh, come on Alex, that's not gonna happen.
[01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:55.059]  I got family that won't even take it serious.
[01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:56.019]  And they know all about it.
[01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:56.879]  It's just like, oh, come on.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:57.760]  Okay.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.160]  Okay.
[01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:02.541]  You look at all the craziness.
[01:04:02.561 --> 01:04:03.542]  They're trying to kill Trump.
[01:04:03.562 --> 01:04:05.522]  Talking about civil war and civil war conditions.
[01:04:05.582 --> 01:04:09.944]  And, oh, the terrorists are going to hit the power grid during the election and turn it off, the FBI says.
[01:04:10.004 --> 01:04:11.385]  And, oh, the right wing's going to do it.
[01:04:11.405 --> 01:04:12.045]  It's all over the news.
[01:04:12.085 --> 01:04:12.925]  Just all made up.
[01:04:12.965 --> 01:04:13.845]  They're getting ready to do it.
[01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:15.166]  They've got it prepared.
[01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:16.426]  You can feel it.
[01:04:16.466 --> 01:04:17.187]  You can see it.
[01:04:17.207 --> 01:04:18.627]  You can intellectually analyze it.
[01:04:19.627 --> 01:04:21.068]  You can spiritually feel it in your gut.
[01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:34.782]  And we can't even get people upset about 325,000 kids that the government shipped in, some of them as young as a year old, that have been totally disappeared into hell on earth.
[01:04:35.862 --> 01:04:37.283]  Slave labor, sex slavery.
[01:04:37.303 --> 01:04:38.324]  It's in the local news.
[01:04:38.364 --> 01:04:39.985]  They keep finding them in sex dungeons.
[01:04:43.507 --> 01:04:44.848]  But Oprah Winfrey can't cover that.
[01:04:44.888 --> 01:04:50.132]  She's too busy covering for Weinstein and Epstein and how great Bill Gates is last night on ABC News and how bad Alex Jones is.
[01:04:52.381 --> 01:04:58.663]  And this morning, without even looking, I just saw it on, flipped through channels, ABC News, MSNBC, CNN, Top of Drudge.
[01:04:59.523 --> 01:05:00.484]  Top story, man!
[01:05:00.524 --> 01:05:01.624]  This is really important.
[01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:03.905]  Loomer Maga Love.
[01:05:04.265 --> 01:05:05.866]  MTG calls Don enraged.
[01:05:06.186 --> 01:05:06.986]  How do they know that?
[01:05:08.466 --> 01:05:16.609]  How is that a story that Laura Loomer has been attacking MTG for years and stirring stuff up?
[01:05:16.689 --> 01:05:17.610]  And I've liked Laura.
[01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.770]  I don't think she's a bad person, but she loves the attention.
[01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:21.671]  And Trump likes her and is nice to her.
[01:05:23.456 --> 01:05:25.617]  And so she flutters around like a moth at the flame.
[01:05:26.197 --> 01:05:29.038]  And then that becomes the, oh, Trump's campaign's falling apart.
[01:05:29.518 --> 01:05:35.180]  Major escalation in the civil war, as if Laura Loomer is his chief of staff or his campaign manager.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.240]  She's not.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:36.960]  She's a journalist.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.960]  She does some good work.
[01:05:38.581 --> 01:05:43.042]  But it's like, can you see that this is Vanity Fair going on here?
[01:05:44.402 --> 01:05:45.643]  This is what's on CNN.
[01:05:45.743 --> 01:05:47.603]  This is one of the top stories.
[01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:48.364]  It's all over the place.
[01:05:49.524 --> 01:05:52.065]  A cat fight, and an MTG is not doing anything publicly.
[01:05:54.639 --> 01:05:58.524]  The media learned, probably isn't even true, of this angry MTG call to Trump.
[01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:00.126]  Wonder who said that?
[01:06:00.847 --> 01:06:02.169]  Wonder who's telling the media this?
[01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:05.994]  You know it's not MTG, I'm sure it's not Laura.
[01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:09.359]  Right, Laura?
[01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:22.308]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff you see before the end of the world.
[01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:26.590]  I mean, I bet the front page of the newspaper of the day there's nuclear war or some crap like this.
[01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:32.613]  I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, this story isn't even a 0.1 billionth.
[01:06:33.834 --> 01:06:36.035]  It isn't even in the same universe.
[01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:37.676]  And you're like, why are you talking about it?
[01:06:37.696 --> 01:06:44.159]  To illustrate, this is beyond shining your shoes when the Titanic's about to break in two and sink.
[01:06:45.498 --> 01:06:46.419]  Oh, there's a lifeboat for you.
[01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:47.119]  Here it is.
[01:06:47.139 --> 01:06:48.200]  The ship's sinking in five minutes.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.181]  I need to shine my shoes right now.
[01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:52.342]  Hold on, do you have a toothpick?
[01:06:52.402 --> 01:06:54.043]  I got a little piece of food stuck in my teeth.
[01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:59.766]  Again, you wake up, your house is on fire, and you go, you know what?
[01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:01.407]  I'm not gonna get my family out of here.
[01:07:01.627 --> 01:07:04.688]  I'm going to go cook a TV dinner and watch television.
[01:07:04.909 --> 01:07:10.892]  You put the TV dinner in the oven, you wait for it even, you know, heats up to 100 degrees, the house collapses on you and you die in flame.
[01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.490]  Oh, there's smoke in the house.
[01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:15.031]  Your wife's passing out.
[01:07:15.651 --> 01:07:16.772]  Uh, honey, we're not gonna leave.
[01:07:17.012 --> 01:07:18.493]  I'm gonna go, uh, take a piss.
[01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:20.594]  I'm gonna go take a shower.
[01:07:20.634 --> 01:07:21.335]  You're in the shower.
[01:07:21.355 --> 01:07:22.596]  Rub-da-dub-dub-dub.
[01:07:22.616 --> 01:07:23.977]  There's smoke and fire shooting in.
[01:07:24.557 --> 01:07:25.578]  Ceiling falls in on you.
[01:07:27.239 --> 01:07:28.780]  I mean, I'm in the twilight zone right now.
[01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.942]  Oh, make it look like Trump's collapsing.
[01:07:33.143 --> 01:07:34.463]  There's a crisis in his campaign.
[01:07:34.804 --> 01:07:37.465]  Reportedly, a congresswoman and some reporter don't like each other.
[01:07:37.706 --> 01:07:39.607]  Yeah, that's a really important thing.
[01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:50.737]  I mean, yeah, look, oh, NBC News, far-right activist Laura Loomer, access to Trump reveals a crisis in his campaign.
[01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:57.861]  Oh my God, Laura Loomer's with the press on the plane, going out the back of the plane.
[01:07:57.921 --> 01:07:58.881]  It's, oh my God!
[01:08:01.523 --> 01:08:03.784]  They're doing the same thing with Laura.
[01:08:05.094 --> 01:08:17.424]  That they did with me, where I'm the Sandy Hook guy, and he's pissing on kids' graves, never happened, and doing all this stuff, and he's Trump's right-hand man, and he tells Trump everything to do, which wasn't true.
[01:08:17.444 --> 01:08:23.049]  People are like, hey, we hear you tell Trump what to do, and I'm like, well, I have given him info, he's listened to me some, but no, barely.
[01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.511]  I haven't yet told Trump he's bad at administration.
[01:08:28.158 --> 01:08:28.699]  Secretly.
[01:08:29.299 --> 01:08:30.060]  That's why they got mad.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.562]  I wasn't running around in the news.
[01:08:32.503 --> 01:08:34.806]  I was talking about on air, but not about me giving Trump info then.
[01:08:35.647 --> 01:08:39.911]  So, that's the type of BS we've got going on here.
[01:08:41.633 --> 01:08:46.278]  AP, Laura Loomer promoted 9-1-1 conspiracy theory, joins Trump for ceremonies marking the attacks.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.240]  Oh my God.
[01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:50.243]  There she is with Corey Lewandowski.
[01:08:51.601 --> 01:08:52.202]  It's all over.
[01:08:52.402 --> 01:08:54.223]  Laura is a good person who fought for free speech.
[01:08:54.804 --> 01:08:55.665]  Exposed a lot of stuff.
[01:08:55.685 --> 01:08:56.265]  A good person.
[01:08:56.805 --> 01:09:01.249]  But I've told her a hundred times on air, or probably ten times on air, a hundred times, stop fighting with MTG.
[01:09:01.289 --> 01:09:03.811]  Stop calling Trump and saying, you know, it isn't an issue.
[01:09:03.851 --> 01:09:04.432]  It doesn't matter.
[01:09:04.852 --> 01:09:05.973]  World War III is what matters.
[01:09:06.053 --> 01:09:07.114]  Open borders is what matters.
[01:09:07.835 --> 01:09:09.416]  But now you see what's going on here.
[01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:14.400]  And maybe it wasn't Laura or somebody, maybe MTG didn't even make the call.
[01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:18.204]  But who is in the staff making this an issue?
[01:09:19.298 --> 01:09:20.098]  Or do the media make it up?
[01:09:20.178 --> 01:09:20.558]  Probably.
[01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:21.759]  I'm done talking about it.
[01:09:22.299 --> 01:09:23.099]  You're like, why are you talking about it?
[01:09:23.119 --> 01:09:25.980]  Because I'm illustrating how insane this is.
[01:09:27.941 --> 01:09:36.224]  It'd be like... if you had... liver cancer.
[01:09:36.244 --> 01:09:37.064]  They could go cut it out.
[01:09:37.284 --> 01:09:40.305]  They had like a 99% success rate on that cancer.
[01:09:40.325 --> 01:09:41.286]  He said, I'm gonna leave that.
[01:09:42.326 --> 01:09:43.626]  I'm not gonna have that emergency surgery.
[01:09:43.786 --> 01:09:44.467]  I'm not gonna have it.
[01:09:44.987 --> 01:09:47.648]  I'm gonna go get my toenails trimmed and get a...
[01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:51.129]  Pedicure?
[01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:52.030]  That's the toes, right?
[01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.431]  Manicure?
[01:09:52.451 --> 01:09:53.031]  I never got it done.
[01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:55.613]  I'm gonna go get a pedicure done.
[01:09:56.834 --> 01:09:58.696]  Or I'm gonna go get my back waxed.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.962]  So... Yeah, I guess there's MTG talking about her.
[01:10:07.823 --> 01:10:08.924]  So they're fighting with each other.
[01:10:08.944 --> 01:10:10.005]  That is so stupid.
[01:10:10.525 --> 01:10:11.726]  I'm not attacking MTG.
[01:10:11.806 --> 01:10:12.187]  I get it.
[01:10:12.247 --> 01:10:14.969]  It's just that... No, I get it.
[01:10:15.029 --> 01:10:18.412]  MTG's horrified by Laura and thinks she's become a detriment to Trump.
[01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:20.027]  But I'm done.
[01:10:20.207 --> 01:10:20.787]  I'm done talking about it.
[01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:24.888]  It's just, can you imagine that we're talking about this, and it's a top story right now, basically.
[01:10:25.248 --> 01:10:25.768]  It's everywhere.
[01:10:26.869 --> 01:10:27.849]  Instead of World War III.
[01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:41.592]  Instead of the Secret Service, in a stand-down, admitted, and a DHS cover-up, top Democrat senators admit, because they're getting ahead of it, because they know the whistleblowers that are about to come out, and Jack Posobiec's on in the fourth hour with me, with key intel and breaking news.
[01:10:42.132 --> 01:10:43.813]  And they got the goods, more will be released soon.
[01:10:44.313 --> 01:10:45.553]  But a lot will be told today.
[01:10:46.923 --> 01:10:48.024]  So we'll stay focused on that.
[01:10:48.284 --> 01:10:50.326]  I'm just saying, see this for what it is.
[01:10:50.867 --> 01:10:52.048]  Don't talk about it.
[01:10:52.168 --> 01:10:53.049]  Don't give it attention.
[01:10:53.089 --> 01:10:53.769]  Don't even respond.
[01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.272]  And I'm doing it just to try to say we need to do that.
[01:10:59.114 --> 01:10:59.434]  All right.
[01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:08.903]  Let's move along here now to what I was just mentioning with the secret service.
[01:11:12.086 --> 01:11:13.407]  This is so important.
[01:11:20.987 --> 01:11:22.987]  There was an attempted coup against President Trump.
[01:11:23.948 --> 01:11:27.148]  They know from the numbers that he's going to win the election despite all the massive fraud.
[01:11:27.168 --> 01:11:28.308]  He has such a landslide coming.
[01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:30.689]  When they failed to kill him, the landslide got even bigger.
[01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:34.329]  They try to give us collective amnesia to not talk about it.
[01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.550]  And they're going to try again with 52 days left.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.690]  This is sure as the sun came up this morning.
[01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:48.792]  And now we have Senator Blumenthal and Murray who are really behind the scenes
[01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:58.174]  Top quarterbacks in the operation against us, and who have run the operations against me, for the law fair, it's come out in court.
[01:11:58.795 --> 01:12:01.836]  They got with the FBI, they got with the law firms, it's all come out.
[01:12:02.196 --> 01:12:03.677]  They got with the CIA, it's all come out.
[01:12:03.697 --> 01:12:05.058]  If you're a new listener, look it up.
[01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:10.280]  I was telling Glenn Beck, this is his podcast, he goes, I know, I know, it's all on record.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:10.760]  Yes, you're right.
[01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:12.021]  He goes, so you know all this?
[01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:13.062]  Yeah, we've been following, Alex, we know.
[01:12:13.782 --> 01:12:15.183]  Like, people know this.
[01:12:15.243 --> 01:12:15.923]  It's like, it's known.
[01:12:17.828 --> 01:12:18.670]  You're worried about yourself.
[01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:19.431]  No, I'm explaining.
[01:12:20.453 --> 01:12:22.596]  These people are in charge of the Deep State.
[01:12:24.499 --> 01:12:27.344]  And they come out and say, oh, the public's going to be really shocked.
[01:12:27.364 --> 01:12:31.671]  There's a cover-up and a stand-down, and this is terrible, and people aren't going to believe this Senate report.
[01:12:33.373 --> 01:12:36.416]  And that's because they know the whistleblowers are coming out with all the proof.
[01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:39.598]  They're already being, been interviewed, been organized, all the proof.
[01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:42.100]  And they're getting ahead of it so it doesn't hit them.
[01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:50.768]  Because I said on the 13th and 14th of July, I believe in the council, this was decided, it was Obama and Senator Blumenthal and Murray.
[01:12:51.088 --> 01:12:52.189]  I know they're in charge.
[01:12:52.309 --> 01:12:53.430]  I know they're in the star chamber.
[01:12:53.831 --> 01:12:54.771]  They're in the cabal.
[01:12:55.092 --> 01:12:55.812]  They're at the top.
[01:12:55.852 --> 01:12:57.654]  They get the globalist orders, but they implement.
[01:12:58.695 --> 01:12:59.595]  And if I had to bet,
[01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:08.825]  My right arm on who made the decisions with Mayorkas for the stand down of the Secret Service and who was in the planning meetings, Blumenthal.
[01:13:09.846 --> 01:13:10.186]  Murray.
[01:13:10.326 --> 01:13:11.007]  And I said that.
[01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:11.647]  Find the clips.
[01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:13.388]  See if the archivist can find that.
[01:13:13.408 --> 01:13:14.810]  I said that in the first few days after.
[01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.572]  And I said they'll suddenly say Iran was involved or is going to try to kill him again.
[01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:20.594]  Three days after I said it, they came out with it.
[01:13:20.654 --> 01:13:21.535]  I know the enemy.
[01:13:22.255 --> 01:13:23.476]  I don't just say this stuff.
[01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:25.498]  I've been attacked by them.
[01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:26.859]  I've literally crawled through the mud.
[01:13:27.899 --> 01:13:28.540]  Metaphysically.
[01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:30.932]  I've been run over by it.
[01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:33.433]  I've tasted the tires of the truck they used to ram me.
[01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:39.516]  That'll get you where you learn the smell and taste and look of something real quick when it's been beating the living snot out of you.
[01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:43.859]  It's them.
[01:13:43.879 --> 01:13:45.620]  It's always been them.
[01:13:48.161 --> 01:13:54.225]  And... The takeaway is that there was a stand-down and there's a DHS cover-up.
[01:13:57.073 --> 01:13:59.174]  They're gonna blame DHS instead of the Justice Department.
[01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:00.135]  They're all the same thing.
[01:14:02.036 --> 01:14:02.977]  Two wings of the same bird.
[01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:05.999]  Two eyes of the same head.
[01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:08.400]  Two different upper and lower beak.
[01:14:09.681 --> 01:14:10.581]  Left and right talon.
[01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:14.023]  Left and right lung.
[01:14:14.824 --> 01:14:15.644]  Left and right kidney.
[01:14:18.426 --> 01:14:22.849]  DHS and... ...Justice Department.
[01:14:24.147 --> 01:14:32.592]  The fact that they're doing this means they know the damning evidence that I've been asked to sit on until it's all presented.
[01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:36.854]  I've known about this stuff for three weeks and they're really ready.
[01:14:36.894 --> 01:14:43.218]  And I've told the people, Pacific's heavily involved, that you better release it quickly.
[01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:48.981]  Well, we're updating the final report and we're getting the witnesses ready.
[01:14:51.912 --> 01:14:54.314]  And Blumenthal's getting out ahead of it, which isn't gonna work.
[01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:56.897]  Because we're gonna explain why he's doing it.
[01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:02.682]  By the way, it was clear they'd already given the questions to Kamala at the ABC debate last Tuesday.
[01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:06.005]  This week.
[01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:07.407]  It was like a hundred years ago.
[01:15:08.848 --> 01:15:12.170]  And then they said they have a whistleblower and now it's confirmed they're about to go public from inside ABC.
[01:15:12.651 --> 01:15:13.612]  Obviously she had the questions.
[01:15:13.652 --> 01:15:15.933]  Donna Brazile did it in 2016 for Hillary at CNN.
[01:15:16.253 --> 01:15:19.436]  She was hired by ABC to be a commentary person.
[01:15:19.836 --> 01:15:21.217]  A trusted expert.
[01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:24.299]  Like, tell us about how the foxes eat the hens.
[01:15:24.339 --> 01:15:25.440]  And the fox has a hen in its mouth.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.281]  Hold on!
[01:15:26.341 --> 01:15:26.981]  I can't talk!
[01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:29.784]  Donna Brazile finishes the hen.
[01:15:29.824 --> 01:15:31.385]  Let me tell you how the foxes eat the hen.
[01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:32.546]  Bon appetit!
[01:15:32.706 --> 01:15:34.427]  Blood dripping off her teeth.
[01:15:35.328 --> 01:15:35.608]  And lips.
[01:15:37.062 --> 01:15:40.464]  Like a Haitian gobbling a cat in your front parking lot, your driveway.
[01:15:40.484 --> 01:15:40.864]  Oh, what's that?
[01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:43.606]  Oh, it's a Haitian's ate Wilbur.
[01:15:44.046 --> 01:15:48.149]  You walk out, she's... And then I told you, she's sucking blood.
[01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:49.270]  She believes it gets demonic power.
[01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.971]  Now we have the recipes and the voodoo rituals and the drinking.
[01:15:52.312 --> 01:15:56.054]  Would you like to see a bunch of videos of Haitians drinking cat's blood in America and other places?
[01:15:57.215 --> 01:15:57.915]  It's coming up.
[01:15:58.075 --> 01:15:58.936]  I know you don't want to see it.
[01:16:00.177 --> 01:16:03.319]  Struggling adolescent cat
[01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:06.123]  All the Haitian drinks his blood live.
[01:16:06.843 --> 01:16:07.604]  He's very adept.
[01:16:07.644 --> 01:16:17.052]  He bites right through the fur into the carotid artery, the jugular, and then it spews lusciously into his mouth as he slurps it with delight.
[01:16:17.712 --> 01:16:18.853]  Very skillfully done.
[01:16:19.294 --> 01:16:24.418]  Trying to grab a cat and its legs while it fights for its life and to suck its blood.
[01:16:26.139 --> 01:16:26.640]  Nice fella.
[01:16:33.703 --> 01:16:35.224]  Yeah, the devil will really screw you up.
[01:16:36.045 --> 01:16:37.986]  Start devil worship from the time you're a year old.
[01:16:38.206 --> 01:16:39.487]  Go to the Target book section for kids.
[01:16:39.527 --> 01:16:40.808]  Half of it's how to devil worship for kids.
[01:16:40.828 --> 01:16:41.348]  Think I'm joking?
[01:16:41.929 --> 01:16:43.710]  How to do black magic spells and kill your parents.
[01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:51.415]  Of course, it doesn't really kill your parents, it just kills your soul, whacks your brain out, so you start thinking about that, and pretty soon you want to drink blood of a cat.
[01:16:52.836 --> 01:16:54.097]  Because that's what these demons want.
[01:16:54.157 --> 01:16:55.698]  They want to debase you in front of God.
[01:16:55.738 --> 01:16:56.858]  They want to take you away from God.
[01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.980]  They want to have that hedge of protection be removed.
[01:17:01.782 --> 01:17:03.083]  So, Blumenthal, Murray,
[01:17:04.349 --> 01:17:19.832]  Hours after Howley, Josh Howley, former Attorney General in Missouri, went on Fox yesterday morning and said, this report's gonna be damning, stand down and cover up.
[01:17:20.172 --> 01:17:21.072]  They went, oh my God!
[01:17:21.352 --> 01:17:24.633]  And they ran out and said, yeah, it's really damning.
[01:17:25.573 --> 01:17:25.753]  Why?
[01:17:25.793 --> 01:17:30.114]  Because I'll bet my bottom dollar that you were in the planning sessions?
[01:17:31.254 --> 01:17:32.214]  Because every time they are,
[01:17:34.386 --> 01:17:36.367]  Little scared there, Stolen Glory, aren't you?
[01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:39.407]  Getting a little concerned there, are you?
[01:17:40.428 --> 01:17:48.850]  When your son deposes me and quarterbacks everything for Daddy, and he talks about it on the Senate floor, how his son's taking down Alex Jones.
[01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:50.891]  What a nice man.
[01:17:54.332 --> 01:17:56.872]  Here's the rat jumping off the sinking ship.
[01:17:57.592 --> 01:17:58.353]  Here's Blumenthal.
[01:17:59.453 --> 01:18:03.114]  I think the American people are going to be shocked, astonished.
[01:18:05.808 --> 01:18:06.348]  I don't know.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:46.407]  Providing information and we are going to absolutely insist on the truth and the whole truth in documents and testimony as members of the United States Senate but also as citizens.
[01:18:46.427 --> 01:18:48.508]  What did you learn new today when you said they're going to be appalled?
[01:18:48.948 --> 01:18:52.530]  I'm not going to go into what we have learned in specifics.
[01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.611]  I'm giving you my reaction.
[01:18:56.331 --> 01:19:16.786]  And we will have a report very, very soon that I think will absolutely shock the American people, or should, about the lapses and lags in the protection that was afforded that day and the breakdown in communication and failure in responsibility.
[01:19:16.866 --> 01:19:18.547]  Is that report coming today or tomorrow?
[01:19:19.508 --> 01:19:19.768]  I'm sorry?
[01:19:19.808 --> 01:19:21.590]  Is that report coming out tonight or tomorrow?
[01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.530]  I think it's coming out right now.
[01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:27.251]  He said noon.
[01:19:28.351 --> 01:19:29.671]  Check and see the reports out, guys.
[01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:30.231]  Check the Senate.
[01:19:30.331 --> 01:19:31.892]  Check Blumenthal's website.
[01:19:33.412 --> 01:19:41.455]  And again, his son deposed me with another Democrat hatchet man, former federal prosecutor, especially.
[01:19:41.475 --> 01:19:42.575]  He's putting Republicans in jail.
[01:19:42.775 --> 01:19:44.076]  The whole thing was trying to look for something criminal.
[01:19:44.716 --> 01:19:45.316]  They even said that.
[01:19:46.345 --> 01:19:48.086]  And I kept saying, you know, your dad's stolen glory.
[01:19:48.126 --> 01:19:49.687]  Never was out of the country, never in combat.
[01:19:49.747 --> 01:19:51.068]  Claimed he was in combat in Vietnam.
[01:19:51.348 --> 01:19:52.609]  He was assigned to the U.S.
[01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:56.111]  Senate as a Marine to do children's programs.
[01:19:56.812 --> 01:19:57.953]  But he says he was a combat vet.
[01:19:58.873 --> 01:20:01.875]  And they finally got so mad, he stopped deposing me and left.
[01:20:02.636 --> 01:20:03.877]  But these people are rats.
[01:20:03.957 --> 01:20:05.378]  They're total scum.
[01:20:05.738 --> 01:20:13.403]  I mean, they just ooze dishonor and filthiness and creepiness and skullduggery and just loathsome treachery.
[01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:23.495]  And... Oh, he's so concerned about the lying and suppressing by the DHS, and... Oh, he's so worried about, oh, what happened?
[01:20:23.515 --> 01:20:24.975]  Oh, you're gonna be shocked by it?
[01:20:25.055 --> 01:20:26.395]  No, we're not shocked by it.
[01:20:28.735 --> 01:20:30.396]  And I say you're the main suspect, buddy!
[01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:34.597]  You don't think we don't know who you are?
[01:20:34.617 --> 01:20:36.497]  Think you can fool us?
[01:20:38.477 --> 01:20:39.197]  Piece of filth.
[01:20:41.778 --> 01:20:41.938]  So...
[01:20:44.326 --> 01:20:47.869]  Here's Senator Howley before they ran out and did this.
[01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:49.190]  Here it is.
[01:20:49.210 --> 01:21:04.401]  See, this is what's so hard to understand is that if this individual had failed one or more of her training exams, if she was known not to be really one of the Secret Service's top agent, she's in the Pittsburgh office, why was she put in charge of the entire trip, Jesse?
[01:21:04.461 --> 01:21:05.442]  I mean, the whole thing.
[01:21:05.482 --> 01:21:07.143]  She was in charge of the whole works.
[01:21:07.543 --> 01:21:11.907]  From the time the president landed to the time he went to Butler, it's just totally inexplicable.
[01:21:11.947 --> 01:21:13.168]  And Jesse, one other thing.
[01:21:13.749 --> 01:21:25.940]  I'm told by people who are close to and have knowledge of the Secret Service's own internal investigation that the Department of Homeland Security is leaning on the Secret Service not to comply with document requests to Congress.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.082]  I mean, this is really getting to be outrageous.
[01:21:29.122 --> 01:21:30.724]  The American people need the truth here.
[01:21:31.311 --> 01:21:32.252]  And that's what's going to come out.
[01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:33.292]  That's the side issue.
[01:21:33.312 --> 01:21:35.654]  But yeah, they put incompetence in charge for the stand down.
[01:21:36.094 --> 01:21:38.375]  And that was so they could bring in their guy and do this.
[01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:39.296]  And they had to stand down.
[01:21:39.636 --> 01:21:41.377]  They tried to kill Trump, period.
[01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:42.217]  It's all coming out.
[01:21:42.257 --> 01:21:43.758]  And what you're hearing is nothing.
[01:21:43.978 --> 01:21:47.180]  They're putting out the whitewash, not Howley, but the other Democrat senators.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:54.725]  They're putting out something that they want to make the scandal that they're just totally incompetent, idiots and horrible and hiding their incompetence.
[01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:54.865]  No.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.881]  It's... Ronald Rowe is not incompetent.
[01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.622]  He ran the whole stand down and lied to Congress about it.
[01:22:01.862 --> 01:22:02.522]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:22:03.642 --> 01:22:05.903]  I got a great way for you to keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:22:06.063 --> 01:22:08.604]  And regardless what happens, InfoWars keep me on the air.
[01:22:09.504 --> 01:22:13.165]  And that's thealexjonesstore.com, a new key URL for you to mark down.
[01:22:13.185 --> 01:22:15.946]  30 plus amazing new t-shirt designs.
[01:22:16.186 --> 01:22:18.147]  I guess more new ones being added every day.
[01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:20.415]  They're incredible.
[01:22:21.216 --> 01:22:22.576]  Trump shirts, you name it.
[01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:24.717]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:22:25.478 --> 01:22:31.881]  And every time you buy a shirt or 30-plus different great designs of Patriot ball caps, you get entered five or 10 times, depending on the day.
[01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:35.203]  It's different every day, into the raffle to get $10,000 cash.
[01:22:35.683 --> 01:22:37.984]  Halloween's when the prize is announced, the winner.
[01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:49.250]  And a $138,000 turbo diesel, super deluxe, off-road upgraded, the best truck you can get, over-the-top, amazing system.
[01:22:50.888 --> 01:22:52.529]  Along with it as well.
[01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:59.812]  And that's the great folks from Bigley that are doing that, thealexjonestore.com.
[01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:04.874]  And the truck is turbo diesel engine, AEV standard features.
[01:23:05.934 --> 01:23:07.055]  And then it's all upgraded.
[01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.555]  I tried to go over, take an hour.
[01:23:08.856 --> 01:23:11.697]  The best tires, the best shocks, the best systems.
[01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:15.919]  It's a 2024 Ram Prospector AEV.
[01:23:15.939 --> 01:23:17.999]  And I just love it.
[01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:19.220]  I picked it out.
[01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:22.650]  Go to thealexjonestore.com.
[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:24.992]  These t-shirts, you gotta get them, and we need your support.
[01:23:25.012 --> 01:23:25.753]  No excuses.
[01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.394]  Take action at thealexjonestore.com.
[01:23:27.414 --> 01:23:27.755]  Thank you.
[01:23:27.955 --> 01:23:28.455]  The year is 2030.
[01:23:28.595 --> 01:23:35.541]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[01:23:35.661 --> 01:23:39.244]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[01:23:39.505 --> 01:23:42.067]  It's bodies from infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:47.214]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[01:23:47.434 --> 01:23:49.236]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[01:23:49.497 --> 01:23:52.400]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the InfoWar.
[01:23:52.521 --> 01:23:56.606]  Visit InfoWarStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[01:23:58.128 --> 01:23:59.209]  Alright, I just talked to him.
[01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:08.002]  Very well-known congresswoman, and she said Trump is giving a press conference right now, and that he's probably going to address the Loomer MTG thing.
[01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:09.243]  Why?
[01:24:09.263 --> 01:24:13.004]  I mean, in the middle of potential World War III, this is what we're talking about.
[01:24:13.024 --> 01:24:17.566]  We've got the Secret Service standing down, DHS lying to Congress, the FBI covering up.
[01:24:18.507 --> 01:24:19.667]  We've got 125,000 missing kids.
[01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:28.051]  Jobs numbers being new numbers that they even fake more than what they said two months ago, a year ago, a week ago.
[01:24:28.672 --> 01:24:31.675]  We've got prices exploding to record levels.
[01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:32.776]  That was all fake news.
[01:24:32.816 --> 01:24:33.637]  They lowered prices.
[01:24:34.357 --> 01:24:41.224]  We've got just all of this insane world government announcements of a world cashless society run by the UN.
[01:24:41.504 --> 01:24:42.105]  I've got that.
[01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:43.946]  And we're talking about Laura Loomer.
[01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:45.147]  Nothing against Laura.
[01:24:45.168 --> 01:24:46.309]  It's just, it's insane.
[01:24:47.654 --> 01:24:50.715]  Imagine if I spent the whole show, Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey attacking me last night.
[01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:56.398]  Sure, that's interesting of what I'm covering, but it just doesn't rate to be talked about.
[01:24:58.218 --> 01:24:58.879]  Oh my God.
[01:25:14.525 --> 01:25:15.806]  I'm so pissed off right now.
[01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:24.148]  In a focused way that I just I don't want to start screaming at people.
[01:25:26.528 --> 01:25:26.788]  I don't.
[01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:29.889]  I don't want World War 3.
[01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:35.451]  And I don't make predictions because I want to scare people.
[01:25:36.846 --> 01:25:40.629]  I make predictions or probabilities because that's what I see from the evidence.
[01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:43.011]  I very calmly and rationally study this stuff.
[01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:48.074]  People that know me personally are like, man, you're really flamboyant on air, but we went to dinner, you barely talked for two hours.
[01:25:48.134 --> 01:25:53.418]  Or friends come over, I sit back, listen to them, relax, family, chill.
[01:25:54.479 --> 01:25:57.061]  But I'm up here talking to millions of people about saving the planet.
[01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:58.582]  I got some energy going on here.
[01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:05.599]  And I don't know what I'm supposed to say to get people's asses in gears.
[01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:11.023]  Oh, I assure you when the hydrogen bombs start dropping and the missiles start detonating, people will be real concerned then.
[01:26:11.043 --> 01:26:13.646]  It's like gold and silver.
[01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:22.073]  When people realize how much inflation there is and that gold is about five times lower than it should be, silver is about 20 times lower than it should be.
[01:26:22.513 --> 01:26:24.295]  Oh, you'll all be running for silver and gold then.
[01:26:26.674 --> 01:26:30.215]  It's just, this stuff is no brainers, what's going on.
[01:26:34.216 --> 01:26:38.577]  I bet if we go to Trump, he's talking about how he was falsely prosecuted or how he has bigger crowd sizes.
[01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:39.197]  And I love Trump.
[01:26:39.217 --> 01:26:40.477]  I don't even know what he's talking about.
[01:26:40.517 --> 01:26:42.557]  I'm just guessing that's what he's talking about.
[01:26:42.617 --> 01:26:44.278]  He should be talking about 325,000 missing children.
[01:26:44.558 --> 01:26:47.518]  He should be talking about how Kamala ran the whole thing when Mayorkas said they should be in prison.
[01:26:48.319 --> 01:26:52.039]  He should be talking about World War III and how they want to bomb Russia with missiles and that's insane.
[01:26:52.099 --> 01:26:52.639]  Maybe he is.
[01:26:52.659 --> 01:26:53.880]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:55.180]  Let's fade him up live right now.
[01:26:56.187 --> 01:26:56.667]  We're good to go.
[01:27:09.977 --> 01:27:18.524]  Define child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as non-violent crimes.
[01:27:18.544 --> 01:27:20.766]  She put them in a new category as non-violent.
[01:27:20.786 --> 01:27:21.767]  She's talking about Kamala as Attorney General.
[01:27:21.787 --> 01:27:30.534]  Now as Vice President, she's facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history, the history of our country by far.
[01:27:32.175 --> 01:27:37.439]  And in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because there can be no bigger scandal than this.
[01:27:38.308 --> 01:27:45.053]  We have, under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing.
[01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:45.053]  325,000.
[01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:57.463]  In other words, take your biggest stadium in California and you could fill it up five or six times.
[01:27:57.983 --> 01:28:00.205]  Those are all missing children.
[01:28:00.725 --> 01:28:01.806]  Many of them are dead.
[01:28:02.647 --> 01:28:06.770]  Many of them are sex slaves and slaves of different nature.
[01:28:07.861 --> 01:28:11.805]  But her destruction of the law and order in California did not end there.
[01:28:11.905 --> 01:28:16.630]  In 2020, Kamala Harris proudly endorsed, defund the police.
[01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:17.832]  We're going to defund the police.
[01:28:17.912 --> 01:28:27.922]  Anybody that was even in favor of defunding the police for one month, let alone her entire career, should never be president of the United States.
[01:28:28.891 --> 01:28:31.813]  She supported a plan to cut the L.A.
[01:28:31.853 --> 01:28:37.557]  Police Department by at least $150 million and ideally more.
[01:28:37.577 --> 01:28:39.798]  This is when your crime in L.A.
[01:28:39.838 --> 01:28:43.061]  was reaching very significant heights today.
[01:28:43.081 --> 01:28:44.301]  All right, fade it down for a minute.
[01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:44.862]  Listen to it.
[01:28:44.882 --> 01:28:46.023]  It gets back to child trafficking.
[01:28:46.123 --> 01:28:46.363]  Okay.
[01:28:47.363 --> 01:28:53.848]  I told you this last month and I told you last week that I was getting him memo write-ups about compare it to sports stadiums full of kids.
[01:28:55.956 --> 01:29:00.138]  That's three and a quarter sports stadiums, the biggest ones filled with kidnapped Children.
[01:29:01.319 --> 01:29:02.199]  They literally got the memo.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.921]  Now the rest of the memo is call for
[01:29:07.128 --> 01:29:12.551]  Finding the children and then the prosecution of Kamala and Mayorkas for being the biggest traffickers in history.
[01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:14.372]  He's starting to do it.
[01:29:14.732 --> 01:29:16.934]  So you see the effect all of you had and we had here, okay?
[01:29:16.954 --> 01:29:22.717]  I don't know whether it was me getting into his topless campaign, or Roger talking to him, or you somewhere, but it's happening.
[01:29:22.797 --> 01:29:24.138]  And I didn't hear what he was talking about.
[01:29:24.178 --> 01:29:25.018]  I was bitching.
[01:29:25.038 --> 01:29:26.639]  I bet it's some side issue.
[01:29:26.679 --> 01:29:27.399]  No, I was wrong.
[01:29:27.419 --> 01:29:28.520]  I went right to him talking about it.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.861]  I don't know, he may have talked about it earlier.
[01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:30.521]  This is great!
[01:29:31.001 --> 01:29:31.722]  This is wonderful!
[01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:32.482]  See, we're doing it!
[01:29:33.043 --> 01:29:33.503]  Let's go back!
[01:29:34.121 --> 01:29:36.223]  This is why all of her policies changed.
[01:29:36.243 --> 01:29:37.464]  She was anti-fracking.
[01:29:37.504 --> 01:29:38.604]  She was anti-everything.
[01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:41.206]  And all of a sudden, she changed.
[01:29:42.087 --> 01:29:46.751]  Even the first question she was given at the debate gave one of the dumbest answers.
[01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:52.595]  They were asking about pricing and would you be better off today or four years ago?
[01:29:53.056 --> 01:29:55.858]  Prices have gone up at numbers that nobody's ever seen before.
[01:29:57.233 --> 01:30:00.956]  And just the concept of being better off, she didn't give the answer.
[01:30:01.116 --> 01:30:05.459]  She talked about when she grew up, nobody knew what the hell she was talking about.
[01:30:05.999 --> 01:30:12.864]  And based on the polls, it didn't work because Rasmussen, as you probably saw, just came out.
[01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:20.809]  And they just lifted me up by six points for president, which is one of the biggest increases they've ever had.
[01:30:20.989 --> 01:30:23.311]  And we broke that Tuesday with the head of Rasmussen.
[01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:27.955]  By the way, get him back on, please.
[01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:31.919]  And I thought the debate was great.
[01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:34.641]  I thought I did very well, but I was fighting three people.
[01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.402]  I was fighting
[01:30:36.571 --> 01:30:44.678]  The crazy left radical lunatics at ABC, I think considered the worst, by me, considered the worst broadcaster out there.
[01:30:45.759 --> 01:30:51.064]  George Slopidopoulos, that whole group, they're bad, and I lost a lot of respect for David Muir.
[01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:58.350]  He came at me with things, and we'll go over it in a second, but I was right about the crime stats going way up.
[01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:00.732]  The fact is the FBI didn't report him.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.964]  And we're able to keep the stats essentially flat.
[01:31:06.825 --> 01:31:08.187]  But the new numbers came in.
[01:31:08.207 --> 01:31:12.932]  I guess somebody in government likes me because the numbers were just released.
[01:31:13.032 --> 01:31:15.855]  And you'll see the kind of numbers that we're talking about.
[01:31:15.875 --> 01:31:17.917]  800 plus cities don't release their numbers now.
[01:31:17.957 --> 01:31:19.439]  Record levels like nobody's seen.
[01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:20.059]  Total fraud.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.301]  When everything was dead on.
[01:31:22.614 --> 01:31:29.961]  And thanks to Kamala, since 2020, crime and drug overdose deaths here have skyrocketed by 40, 50, and 60 percent.
[01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:33.183]  And murder has reached an all-time high.
[01:31:34.464 --> 01:31:35.746]  We don't want this for our country.
[01:31:35.966 --> 01:31:36.807]  That's why I'm doing this.
[01:31:36.887 --> 01:31:41.230]  I don't like doing this, other than I know you all have the nicest view you're going to ever have.
[01:31:42.411 --> 01:31:45.094]  But somebody's got to explain this.
[01:31:45.314 --> 01:31:48.437]  There's a radical left, Marxist, communist, fascist.
[01:31:50.157 --> 01:31:55.561]  As borders are, she then launched a colossal invasion of California's southern border.
[01:31:56.201 --> 01:32:04.726]  Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a Venezuelan gang is expanding its deadly reach in the United States for two reasons.
[01:32:05.207 --> 01:32:07.228]  Number one, first sentence of the story begins.
[01:32:07.408 --> 01:32:07.508]  U.S.
[01:32:07.548 --> 01:32:17.554]  law enforcement officials have watched with alarm the spread of a Venezuelan gang known for dismembering people, dismembering people, right?
[01:32:17.654 --> 01:32:18.555]  Dismembering people.
[01:32:20.202 --> 01:32:22.843]  From Chile to Colombia, they're all over the place.
[01:32:22.903 --> 01:32:24.044]  Now they're in our country.
[01:32:25.425 --> 01:32:26.726]  They're known as MS-13.
[01:32:26.766 --> 01:32:30.628]  They're considered the meanest, toughest gang in the world.
[01:32:30.688 --> 01:32:39.292]  In Long Island, not so long ago, two young 16-year-old girls were walking to school, and they carved them up with a knife.
[01:32:39.332 --> 01:32:40.313]  They killed both of them.
[01:32:40.353 --> 01:32:41.493]  They carved them up with a knife.
[01:32:41.533 --> 01:32:42.414]  They didn't want to shoot them.
[01:32:43.912 --> 01:32:45.253]  And we got them out.
[01:32:45.613 --> 01:32:48.494]  I got them out so fast, and we did a big number.
[01:32:48.514 --> 01:32:52.756]  And I wanted to thank ICE while I'm at it, because ICE has been unbelievable.
[01:32:52.796 --> 01:32:54.417]  Border Patrol has been unbelievable.
[01:32:55.578 --> 01:32:56.758]  And she wants to get rid of ICE.
[01:32:56.778 --> 01:32:58.159]  She wants to dismember ICE.
[01:32:58.199 --> 01:32:59.479]  She wants to take them out.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:03.101]  And if you didn't have ICE, you'd have a problem in this country.
[01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:04.322]  ICE would go in.
[01:33:04.342 --> 01:33:08.984]  I remember in Long Island with us, they had a gang that was brutal, MS-13 gang.
[01:33:10.145 --> 01:33:12.426]  They came out of prisons from different places.
[01:33:13.399 --> 01:33:16.220]  And they formed, for whatever reason, Long Island seems to be a place.
[01:33:17.541 --> 01:33:24.563]  And I'll never forget the scene of ICE going into a rat's nest, they call them, when you have a lot of them together.
[01:33:24.623 --> 01:33:25.223]  Rat's nest.
[01:33:26.224 --> 01:33:30.325]  And they walked into that nest, and you just saw arms and fists and feet.
[01:33:31.206 --> 01:33:32.246]  Everybody was flying.
[01:33:33.367 --> 01:33:34.887]  And three minutes later, he saw it.
[01:33:35.307 --> 01:33:39.469]  Three minutes later, they walked out with these guys.
[01:33:40.936 --> 01:33:44.618]  Remember, the deep state tried to kill this guy two months ago today.
[01:33:44.638 --> 01:33:45.579]  There's nothing they won't do.
[01:34:10.162 --> 01:34:12.623]  I think probably the worst of all.
[01:34:12.643 --> 01:34:14.264]  Our government is hijacked by criminals.
[01:34:14.344 --> 01:34:14.845]  It was rough.
[01:34:15.845 --> 01:34:17.386]  We had four in South America.
[01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:17.886]  We have.
[01:34:18.307 --> 01:34:18.607]  All right.
[01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:28.012]  We'll go back to this and we've got the crew monitoring it, but he, I know he's been briefed because he did the sports stadium analogy that I was using last week.
[01:34:28.052 --> 01:34:33.435]  And then I know I told people to tell him that's the kind of thing he likes, but he didn't do the rest of it.
[01:34:33.455 --> 01:34:34.336]  He's going off notes.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.823]  And maybe he's made the decision to say he's not going to try to find the kids and have a national initiative to do it in the task force.
[01:34:40.863 --> 01:34:43.364]  Maybe he doesn't want to say he's going to go after them criminally.
[01:34:43.865 --> 01:34:45.486]  But he's already saying he is on the other stuff.
[01:34:46.166 --> 01:34:48.167]  And they go, oh no, you better not be mean and go after us.
[01:34:48.187 --> 01:34:49.008]  That's politically bad.
[01:34:49.068 --> 01:34:51.989]  No, people want to hear you're going to follow justice and go after them.
[01:34:54.131 --> 01:34:58.793]  I mean, they're kidnapping children and shipping them in and protecting the people doing it.
[01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:00.234]  We have a responsibility.
[01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.155]  God's watching.
[01:35:02.295 --> 01:35:03.176]  But I'm at least
[01:35:05.552 --> 01:35:09.034]  Encouraged by what I just saw.
[01:35:09.094 --> 01:35:11.475]  The Senate reports 325,000 and it's growing.
[01:35:11.776 --> 01:35:12.476]  That's old numbers.
[01:35:13.637 --> 01:35:18.419]  So, speaking of that, let's get into this.
[01:35:18.439 --> 01:35:26.744]  I got a lot of news here before the next few guests join us, including Jack Posobiec, with huge news and intel on what really happened in Butler.
[01:35:26.764 --> 01:35:29.206]  We're getting a lot of intel confirming what we already know.
[01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:32.871]  That's why you've seen Democrats in the Senate.
[01:35:32.911 --> 01:35:34.272]  Oh my God, a report's coming out today.
[01:35:34.652 --> 01:35:35.312]  It's really bad.
[01:35:35.393 --> 01:35:36.133]  You're not going to like it.
[01:35:36.213 --> 01:35:38.935]  Oh, they stood down and they're suppressing the truth and covering up.
[01:35:38.975 --> 01:35:39.916]  We're not part of the cover-up.
[01:35:41.237 --> 01:35:41.717]  No, no, no.
[01:35:42.197 --> 01:35:43.118]  So look at these headlines.
[01:35:44.919 --> 01:35:49.663]  Ohio Election Integrity Unit discovers illegal Haitian voter registration fraud operation.
[01:35:51.684 --> 01:35:57.609]  The Ohio Secretary of State issued a press release yesterday that notified the Ohio
[01:35:59.389 --> 01:36:10.757]  State's 88 County Boards of Elections of an investigation by the Election Integrity Unit which covered illegal voting registration in Creole, a language common in Haiti.
[01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:21.405]  The Office Election Integrity Unit recently concluded an investigation in the origins of an illegal voter registration form transmitted in the Haitian Creole language.
[01:36:21.686 --> 01:36:28.411]  The Clark County Board of Elections reported the form to our office after rejecting its submission by a local applicant.
[01:36:29.127 --> 01:36:36.630]  The press release said Thursday the state government is monitoring third-party groups and paid canvassers for potential fraud.
[01:36:38.191 --> 01:36:39.792]  And it just goes on from there, of course.
[01:36:40.312 --> 01:36:42.113]  But we want to show you what's happening.
[01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:54.078]  Despite Democrat gaslighting, more videos emerged confirming Haitian migrant mayhem in Ohio, including police reports and arrests for murdering people's cats and drinking their blood in front of them.
[01:36:54.969 --> 01:37:01.954]  Eating cats issue will blow up in the Dems' face as more learn about Haitian voodoo says former Democrat candidate Marina Williamson.
[01:37:03.035 --> 01:37:04.996]  Got a lot of Christian Haitians coming out saying no.
[01:37:06.497 --> 01:37:08.639]  They kill and drink the cat's blood live.
[01:37:08.719 --> 01:37:14.023]  Like I said last week, the lady drinking his blood in the parking lot in the driveway of the house in Springfield, Ohio.
[01:37:14.083 --> 01:37:15.804]  I said she's doing it as a voodoo ritual.
[01:37:17.826 --> 01:37:20.988]  Now, viewer discretion is very seriously advised.
[01:37:23.746 --> 01:37:32.448]  Well, I'm about to show you this man expertly holding a cat by its back and front paws, gripping an adolescent cat.
[01:37:32.468 --> 01:37:33.908]  It's not a kitten, but it's in between.
[01:37:33.928 --> 01:37:35.408]  It's a medium-sized cat.
[01:37:36.168 --> 01:37:37.269]  Radialisers, I'm describing it.
[01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:44.950]  And he bites right through the fur and the skin, ripping open the juggler, like a vampire, like Count Dracula would do.
[01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:50.371]  And then expertly, like he's drinking out of a straw, sucking his blood live.
[01:37:52.469 --> 01:37:53.649]  Go ahead and roll the video.
[01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:00.411]  Delicious!
[01:38:00.711 --> 01:38:02.131]  And nutritious.
[01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:29.953]  In Kenya, they drink bloods right out of the cow's necks.
[01:38:31.435 --> 01:38:37.202]  They have a little hammer and a little pick, and they just, boop, and then they, it shoots out their mouth, and they put it in a bucket.
[01:38:37.923 --> 01:38:39.245]  They mix pee with it and drink it.
[01:38:40.066 --> 01:38:40.706]  Think I'm joking?
[01:38:40.846 --> 01:38:45.272]  Type in, uh, Kenyans mix cow blood with urine and drink it.
[01:38:46.772 --> 01:38:49.253]  That's the standard morning snack.
[01:38:50.094 --> 01:38:51.234]  And I'm not even attacking them.
[01:38:51.474 --> 01:38:52.855]  They're keeping the cow alive, they're doing it.
[01:38:52.895 --> 01:38:55.736]  It's a vampiric thing, but you mix it with the milk, it doesn't make you sick.
[01:38:56.437 --> 01:38:57.277]  I mean, we eat the meat.
[01:38:57.877 --> 01:39:01.539]  But it shows a totally different culture just being dropped down.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.920]  But the Kenyans do it for sustenance.
[01:39:05.121 --> 01:39:06.081]  These guys do it.
[01:39:07.242 --> 01:39:09.423]  They believe they're taking the spirit of the animal.
[01:39:10.264 --> 01:39:13.025]  That's what voodoo is, is becoming possessed by a spirit.
[01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:18.234]  What you call liquor spirits is also drink to get possessed.
[01:39:18.975 --> 01:39:19.855]  Not the only ones that do it.
[01:39:19.896 --> 01:39:22.998]  It's part of ancient rituals that are all over the world.
[01:39:23.579 --> 01:39:26.722]  That's what the Mayans and Aztecs and Toltecs before them did.
[01:39:26.742 --> 01:39:33.949]  They drank alcoholic, narcotic drinks that have narcotics in it as well to sacrifice and be sacrificed.
[01:39:35.190 --> 01:39:36.011]  Here's footage.
[01:39:37.961 --> 01:39:44.847]  of one of the Haitians in Springfield coming in with like an eight-year-old girl who the parents are crazy enough to let go to the local convenience store.
[01:39:45.387 --> 01:39:50.571]  He comes up, kisses her on the neck, whispers to her, tries to grab her, and the cashier saves her.
[01:39:51.372 --> 01:39:52.533]  Let's go ahead and roll that footage.
[01:40:08.803 --> 01:40:12.306]  And for radio listeners, he comes up, starts putting his face up to her neck, whispering to her.
[01:40:15.588 --> 01:40:17.149]  And the woman says, leave the kid alone.
[01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:20.832]  And that's what the locals are all reporting, black, white, you name it.
[01:40:26.076 --> 01:40:27.217]  She holds her hands till he leaves.
[01:40:28.518 --> 01:40:30.500]  And then the mother's actually there, she didn't even know.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.301]  A few seconds and he moved in.
[01:40:32.962 --> 01:40:33.842]  He's like, what's the problem?
[01:40:38.005 --> 01:40:38.526]  Now he's mad.
[01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:47.273]  Because in Kenya, excuse me, in Haiti, that's what you do.
[01:40:47.313 --> 01:40:48.573]  You don't do that in Kenya, they'd kill you there.
[01:40:48.593 --> 01:40:50.935]  I have to say most Africans don't put up with that either.
[01:40:51.435 --> 01:40:56.718]  But the Haitians have been lawless and out of control and slaves from the beginning when they got there.
[01:40:56.858 --> 01:40:58.079]  And it's just, it's cursed.
[01:40:58.099 --> 01:40:58.799]  It's a cursed island.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.001]  Their side of the island's all deforested.
[01:41:02.021 --> 01:41:04.162]  There's no animals basically, no birds, lizards, they eat them all.
[01:41:04.872 --> 01:41:06.773]  The other side's Dominican Republic, all green and beautiful.
[01:41:07.513 --> 01:41:08.133]  Very, very sad.
[01:41:08.874 --> 01:41:10.955]  We've already played this, but I mean, they say this doesn't exist.
[01:41:10.975 --> 01:41:12.355]  This woman's been arrested, charged.
[01:41:12.976 --> 01:41:15.317]  She said, reportedly now, that she wanted the spirit of the cat.
[01:41:16.297 --> 01:41:18.258]  And she bares her teeth to the police.
[01:41:19.138 --> 01:41:20.079]  And it's like, what's the problem?
[01:41:20.099 --> 01:41:22.860]  Just in somebody's driveway, at night, drinking their cat's blood.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:23.760]  I mean, what's the problem?
[01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:25.041]  What we do in Haiti.
[01:41:25.081 --> 01:41:25.581]  Here's the footage.
[01:41:26.222 --> 01:41:28.983]  Someone got rubber gloves.
[01:41:29.003 --> 01:41:29.823]  She's covering blood.
[01:41:32.945 --> 01:41:33.605]  Everybody, you got gloves?
[01:41:35.029 --> 01:41:35.830]  You got rubber gloves?
[01:41:47.997 --> 01:41:48.778]  Smile for me.
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.161]  Go like this.
[01:41:55.322 --> 01:41:56.322]  Did you eat that cat?
[01:41:58.764 --> 01:41:59.364]  Did you eat it?
[01:42:01.245 --> 01:42:02.226]  No, why'd you kill it?
[01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:05.938]  Get in there.
[01:42:06.498 --> 01:42:07.278]  It's ridiculous.
[01:42:11.979 --> 01:42:18.461]  It's alright other kitty, you're safe.
[01:42:24.362 --> 01:42:25.502]  Did you guys see all this?
[01:42:25.522 --> 01:42:29.703]  No, we pulled up and she was just laying there with me.
[01:42:29.723 --> 01:42:31.004]  Did you see her eating it?
[01:42:31.924 --> 01:42:32.664]  She was eating it?
[01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:36.811]  She was drinking the blood.
[01:42:39.312 --> 01:42:39.572]  Yes.
[01:42:40.492 --> 01:42:43.093]  Vampire activity.
[01:42:43.133 --> 01:42:48.234]  They ate people in Haiti.
[01:42:48.674 --> 01:42:48.994]  On record.
[01:42:53.575 --> 01:42:57.096]  Let's go to Tucker Carlson, what he has to say about it.
[01:42:57.136 --> 01:42:59.657]  Go ahead and skip to that.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.361]  No, here's the point, though.
[01:43:08.902 --> 01:43:12.505]  It's not that the pets are being eaten, it's that they're being sacrificed, actually.
[01:43:12.905 --> 01:43:13.445]  That's the truth.
[01:43:13.685 --> 01:43:14.246]  That's the truth.
[01:43:14.906 --> 01:43:22.591]  We've imported a lot of people, over 5% of the population, from a country in which witchcraft is the dominant religion.
[01:43:22.931 --> 01:43:23.812]  And that's not a guess.
[01:43:23.892 --> 01:43:25.813]  I've been to that country.
[01:43:26.153 --> 01:43:28.055]  I know a lot of great people from that country, by the way.
[01:43:28.075 --> 01:43:29.796]  I'm not attacking everyone in the country at all.
[01:43:30.632 --> 01:43:37.334]  But the fact is that the people in question come from a country in which witchcraft is the dominant religion and in which human sacrifice is a regular occurrence.
[01:43:37.374 --> 01:43:37.935]  That's just a fact.
[01:43:55.139 --> 01:43:58.041]  And why the rats are leaving the sinking ship, but on a bunch of other issues.
[01:43:58.061 --> 01:44:01.764]  The campaign, Trump assassination attempts that we know are they're planning.
[01:44:03.165 --> 01:44:06.087]  But I've got a lot of other news that I want to hit as well.
[01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:09.349]  And several clips on that.
[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:12.952]  So get the clip ready with Trump for the next segment.
[01:44:14.133 --> 01:44:16.735]  Saying no free money for illegals to get mortgages.
[01:44:16.755 --> 01:44:16.875]  Yeah.
[01:44:16.895 --> 01:44:20.297]  Should have a debate about whether citizens should be getting that.
[01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:21.298]  Maybe veterans or something?
[01:44:22.844 --> 01:44:25.046]  Maybe you shouldn't take old folks' homes when they're out of money.
[01:44:25.086 --> 01:44:27.267]  I mean, you certainly don't just hand out free money.
[01:44:27.287 --> 01:44:27.788]  You can't do that.
[01:44:27.808 --> 01:44:28.869]  It'll make people dependent.
[01:44:28.889 --> 01:44:29.609]  It'll bankrupt the country.
[01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:34.313]  But $150,000 free for illegal aliens in California.
[01:44:34.573 --> 01:44:38.596]  $30,000 free in other states like Washington and Oregon and Illinois.
[01:44:38.616 --> 01:44:44.541]  $3,000 a month from the Feds to the Haitians and everybody else on top of all the other aid and assistance.
[01:44:46.923 --> 01:44:49.865]  Then I've got, boom, Trump proposes no taxes on overtime pay.
[01:44:52.233 --> 01:44:58.976]  We've got confirmation they're about to release the whistleblower's affidavits with the law firms and everything about ABC giving the questions to Kamala beforehand.
[01:44:59.016 --> 01:45:01.117]  We've got the media caught in huge fake news against Trump.
[01:45:02.458 --> 01:45:05.699]  They're now saying that CHOP in Seattle never existed.
[01:45:06.679 --> 01:45:09.701]  And the Seattle Times has come out and said it's another lie of Trump.
[01:45:10.201 --> 01:45:12.202]  No one ever took over any areas of Seattle.
[01:45:12.222 --> 01:45:15.884]  And then I have all the articles and videos of them taking over and calling it CHOP.
[01:45:18.185 --> 01:45:20.746]  I mean, that's like saying Tom Brady never played in the NFL.
[01:45:21.707 --> 01:45:22.267]  Seattle Times.
[01:45:22.648 --> 01:45:24.629]  It's that level of just a crazy lie.
[01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:29.131]  It's... It's crazy.
[01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:31.593]  I mean, it's just like, like, it's just on its face.
[01:45:32.753 --> 01:45:35.795]  Kamala also says she never wanted transgender surgery for prisoners or illegals.
[01:45:35.815 --> 01:45:36.895]  We have all the videos and articles.
[01:45:37.296 --> 01:45:38.436]  The media is saying Trump's lying.
[01:45:39.737 --> 01:45:41.558]  So much more next hour.
[01:45:42.338 --> 01:45:43.079]  Please stay with us.
[01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:50.163]  Now... This is an action item for listeners and viewers.
[01:45:51.974 --> 01:45:52.875]  I need you to listen to me.
[01:45:53.215 --> 01:45:54.076]  We're in an info war.
[01:45:54.376 --> 01:45:58.440]  When you wear a cool Patriot shirt, you meet all the cool people.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.703]  And I wear these, and I'm also Alex Jones, so I get the same effect without a shirt.
[01:46:03.784 --> 01:46:05.666]  I get 99.9% love now.
[01:46:05.686 --> 01:46:06.347]  I didn't used to get that.
[01:46:06.467 --> 01:46:10.390]  I would not wear these shirts into downtown Portland.
[01:46:10.410 --> 01:46:15.495]  I still get a lot of love, but also probably stabbed in the back or something, or other super calming areas.
[01:46:15.515 --> 01:46:16.716]  But everywhere else,
[01:46:17.944 --> 01:46:42.662]  You spread the word, you meet like-minded people, and by buying these shirts at thealexjonestore.com, I'll show you some of the great designs, over 30 there, and ball caps, you fund the operation, you keep us on air, and this is separate from InfoWars, so even if they shut this place down, the folks we're working with, this will help us get relaunched quickly, so we need the funds, we need the support, we got the best baseball caps, the best shirts, high quality, made right here in America, printed in America,

[01:46:57.796 --> 01:47:02.198]  Dodge Ram 2024 Prospector AEV.
[01:47:03.019 --> 01:47:04.639]  And you just got to learn about it there on the site.
[01:47:04.979 --> 01:47:07.801]  When you buy something, it varies day to day.
[01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:10.562]  You get five entries some days, 10 entries other days.
[01:47:12.639 --> 01:47:15.860]  But you always get entered into the raffle 5 to 10 more times.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.520]  It's a win-win.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.041]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:47:21.761 --> 01:47:24.262]  And these are the best t-shirts, the best designs.
[01:47:24.282 --> 01:47:25.502]  They're absolutely amazing.
[01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:29.383]  You can email there as well and recommend a design you like.
[01:47:29.723 --> 01:47:32.223]  These are some of the top designers in the country doing this that we partnered with.
[01:47:32.243 --> 01:47:33.384]  It's their operation.
[01:47:33.924 --> 01:47:35.224]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:47:35.264 --> 01:47:36.564]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:47:36.604 --> 01:47:38.305]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:39.265]  One word.
[01:47:40.265 --> 01:47:46.272]  We'll post the link up in the live show feed, too, at infowars.com if you missed that, but thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:59.188]  Separately, drjonesnaturals.com, incredible nano silver products, incredible colloidal silver, incredible next-level foundational energy that's selling out, drjonesnaturals.com, and then all the other incredible products at infowarsstore.com, like Nitric Boost,
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.841]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[01:48:22.352 --> 01:48:35.143]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[01:48:35.603 --> 01:48:37.805]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[01:48:38.626 --> 01:48:44.051]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:53.673]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[01:48:54.013 --> 01:48:55.874]  We had five companies making product for us.
[01:48:56.495 --> 01:49:00.997]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[01:49:01.717 --> 01:49:07.400]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:10.282]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[01:49:11.102 --> 01:49:12.623]  And they said, listen, you know
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:29.827]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[01:49:30.207 --> 01:49:36.870]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[01:49:37.967 --> 01:49:39.269]  We're good to go.
[01:49:49.873 --> 01:49:57.977]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[01:49:58.057 --> 01:50:04.680]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.341]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:50:07.501 --> 01:50:09.422]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[01:50:09.622 --> 01:50:19.410]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:22.432]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[01:50:22.492 --> 01:50:23.553]  Take Turmeric 95.
[01:50:25.214 --> 01:50:31.936]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[01:50:32.036 --> 01:50:37.718]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[01:50:37.798 --> 01:50:46.321]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[01:50:46.381 --> 01:50:48.442]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[01:50:50.069 --> 01:51:03.372]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[01:51:03.852 --> 01:51:08.253]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[01:51:08.313 --> 01:51:12.954]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[01:51:13.274 --> 01:51:16.716]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[01:51:16.856 --> 01:51:19.198]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[01:51:19.298 --> 01:51:19.918]  It's amazing.
[01:51:20.038 --> 01:51:20.959]  It's super high quality.
[01:51:21.039 --> 01:51:22.900]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:23.700]  Nitric Boost.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.561]  Good night's sleep.
[01:51:24.781 --> 01:51:26.322]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[01:51:26.422 --> 01:51:27.702]  Nerve Renewed Prostate Support.
[01:51:27.762 --> 01:51:28.783]  Probiotic Formula.
[01:51:28.903 --> 01:51:30.424]  CBD Full Spectrum.

[01:51:31.945 --> 01:51:33.106]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[01:51:33.346 --> 01:51:34.146]  10 milligram gummies.
[01:51:34.166 --> 01:51:34.726]  Works great.
[01:51:34.787 --> 01:51:35.787]  Turmeric 95.
[01:51:35.927 --> 01:51:37.088]  Libido RX.
[01:51:37.248 --> 01:51:37.868]  Better Mood.

[01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:42.531]  Superfood Greens.

[01:52:18.095 --> 01:52:27.583]  Recently published research from Korea and Japan confirmed previous reports we've heard of nanotech in the COVID-19 injectables.
[01:52:28.484 --> 01:52:33.068]  Contents of the COVID-19 injectables produced by Pfizer and Moderna
[01:52:33.368 --> 01:52:38.151]  were examined under a stereo microscope at 400 times magnification.
[01:52:38.631 --> 01:52:43.914]  Specimens were cultured in different media to observe the effect they had on living cells.
[01:52:44.555 --> 01:52:58.163]  The study concluded that the anomalous injuries that have occurred worldwide since the injectables were pressed upon billions of individuals were caused by the nanotechnology contents of the COVID-19 injectables.
[01:52:59.784 --> 01:53:10.497]  The research found cellular toxicity and over the course of a few weeks, simple one-dimensional structures grew into complex three-dimensional structures.
[01:53:11.405 --> 01:53:30.514]  Numerous artificial self-assembling nano-sized objects of many different shapes, including animated worm-like entities, discs, chains, spirals, tubes, and right-angle structures containing other artificial structures within them.
[01:53:31.194 --> 01:53:36.237]  Some structures even seemed to appear and then disappear over time.
[01:53:37.137 --> 01:53:43.500]  All of this was found to be well beyond any expected and acceptable levels of contamination.
[01:53:44.421 --> 01:53:56.287]  This was first reported on nearly three years ago by Ricardo Delgado and La Quinta Columna out of Spain, who found a relationship between the nanotech and 5G.
[01:53:58.504 --> 01:54:11.178]  The fifth column recently published their findings and conclusions on the strange self-assembling nanotech they discovered in the Pfizer mRNA vaccines via optical microscopy analysis.
[01:54:12.236 --> 01:54:17.279]  The objects they found in the vaccine correspond with known items in the scientific record.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:20.802]  And the conclusion they come to seems quite clear.
[01:54:21.362 --> 01:54:35.192]  That the well-documented scientific goal to use nanotechnology and living human beings to form networks capable of controlling several nanomachines is currently being deployed in the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:54:36.232 --> 01:54:41.136]  Which amounts to the most intrusive assault against humanity in all of recorded history.
[01:54:42.943 --> 01:54:51.826]  5G towers were fired up for the first time in Wuhan, the same time they were reportedly experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak.
[01:54:52.946 --> 01:54:58.348]  David Icke said there was a relationship between COVID-19 and 5G back in 2020, and it got him banned.
[01:55:02.012 --> 01:55:14.315]  Using dark field microscopy, Dr. Ana Maria Mielchia has found these same artificial nanostructures in the blood of both those who got the COVID-19 injectables and those who did not.
[01:55:15.456 --> 01:55:30.740]  Decades ago, Silicon Valley guru Ray Kurzweil said that by 2045, most of human civilization will be non-biological machines, thanks to the advancements of nanorobots, which could cure aging and death.
[01:55:31.926 --> 01:55:39.493]  While talk of mRNA is making it easily into the mainstream, the nanotech is being ignored.
[01:55:40.174 --> 01:55:45.019]  According to the work at La Quinta Columna, there is no mRNA spike protein.
[01:55:45.579 --> 01:55:48.742]  According to their research, it's all about the nanotech.
[01:55:49.483 --> 01:55:58.026]  Which they recently reported can be totally destroyed by a nicotine mixture derived from tobacco and distilled water.
[01:55:58.766 --> 01:56:03.788]  Hopefully, this nicotine study will be repeated by other independent scientists.
[01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:11.511]  Because the mass infection of humanity with experimental nanotech has now been ignored for at least three years.
[01:56:11.991 --> 01:56:13.952]  And all sides of political leadership
[01:56:14.292 --> 01:56:24.043]  are steering us towards a brave new world of AI and the Internet of Things, where being an organic human being seems to not be an option.
[01:56:25.084 --> 01:56:27.527]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:56:29.068 --> 01:56:39.781]  Powerful report up at Bandot Video and on Renault Exchange on X. All right, one of my favorite podcasters, really smart guy, Jeremy from The Quartering, right there on screen, is going to join us in one minute.
[01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:41.443]  We're going to take a break for one minute.
[01:56:41.463 --> 01:56:42.624]  Over 300 radio stations.
[01:56:42.744 --> 01:56:43.485]  Remember those things?
[01:56:43.505 --> 01:56:45.247]  That's why we have breaks, people, on X and places.
[01:56:45.728 --> 01:56:47.731]  Because we're still on air when they banned me six years ago.
[01:56:47.751 --> 01:56:48.672]  We had the radio stations.
[01:56:49.013 --> 01:56:49.414]  We love them.
[01:56:49.434 --> 01:56:50.415]  They still got big audiences.
[01:56:50.475 --> 01:56:50.876]  Support them.
[01:56:51.276 --> 01:56:55.643]  We're going to join 300 plus radio stations in 60 seconds when we come back.
[01:56:55.723 --> 01:56:59.849]  Also coming up, exclusive look at my interview with Glenn Beck that hasn't dropped yet.
[01:57:01.014 --> 01:57:01.835]  And more!
[01:57:02.195 --> 01:57:08.579]  And Jack Posobiec with the key intel on why they're so scared about this information coming out about the attempted Trump assassination.
[01:57:09.199 --> 01:57:11.341]  All right, I've been wanting to get him on for a while.
[01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:13.442]  Jeremy from TheQuartering, TheQuartering.com.
[01:57:13.542 --> 01:57:15.624]  Very popular on X and on YouTube.
[01:57:15.644 --> 01:57:17.365]  One of the top podcasters out there.
[01:57:17.745 --> 01:57:19.446]  Makes a lot of really smart, cogent points.
[01:57:19.466 --> 01:57:22.308]  I wanted to get him in to just cover the waterfront in this hour.
[01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:23.349]  The Jack Posobiec
[01:57:24.465 --> 01:57:26.726]  Who's involved with some of the other groups I'm talking to.
[01:57:27.387 --> 01:57:28.987]  There's Army Special Operations.
[01:57:29.027 --> 01:57:30.348]  There's Eric Prentz.
[01:57:30.448 --> 01:57:31.189]  It's not a secret.
[01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:32.589]  Their phones are all tapped.
[01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:33.710]  It's not a secret from the government.
[01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.071]  The corrupt people have hijacked the government.
[01:57:35.611 --> 01:57:38.513]  And the Trump campaign about what really happened in Butler two months ago.
[01:57:39.733 --> 01:57:41.694]  And they got reports coming out.
[01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.315]  They got books coming out.
[01:57:43.675 --> 01:57:45.556]  Somebody's got a book that's about to digitally go out.
[01:57:46.457 --> 01:57:50.279]  I'm not going to give them the inside baseball on what they've got, but that's why the Democrats have all come out.
[01:57:50.379 --> 01:57:53.841]  Senator Blumenthal and Warren, who are at the top of the deep state management team,
[01:57:55.177 --> 01:57:59.399]  Oh my God, they stood down and they're suppressing evidence and obstruction of justice.
[01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:01.379]  We're so concerned about DHS.
[01:58:01.439 --> 01:58:03.940]  Well, the Justice Department is just as involved as that.
[01:58:05.621 --> 01:58:08.102]  Jack joins us about what he can tell us so far.
[01:58:08.162 --> 01:58:11.863]  And I know what's going on, but I'm not at liberty to tell you, but you can probably make wild guesses here.
[01:58:11.883 --> 01:58:15.564]  They got whistleblowers, they got witnesses, they got investigations, they got it all.
[01:58:15.584 --> 01:58:19.666]  And they don't want what their investigation has quite found because they're getting more, even more damning.
[01:58:19.686 --> 01:58:22.467]  But that, I just say release what you got now, the other stuff later.
[01:58:24.085 --> 01:58:30.567]  And then Jack, obviously, is going to be joining me with Tucker Carlson in Pennsylvania on the 23rd.
[01:58:30.627 --> 01:58:32.408]  That's not this next Monday, but the Monday after.
[01:58:32.488 --> 01:58:33.768]  It's going to probably sell out.
[01:58:33.788 --> 01:58:37.190]  They even expanded, you know, because they had it set for so many thousands.
[01:58:37.230 --> 01:58:38.430]  Now they expanded to the full deal.
[01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:39.691]  They want to totally fill it.
[01:58:39.711 --> 01:58:41.411]  I talked to him this morning.
[01:58:41.431 --> 01:58:42.972]  It looks like that's going to happen, so get your tickets now.
[01:58:42.992 --> 01:58:44.032]  I really want to see you there.
[01:58:44.672 --> 01:58:45.573]  That's TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:58:46.733 --> 01:58:47.594]  We're good to go.
[01:58:47.614 --> 01:58:48.335]  We're good to go.
[01:58:48.375 --> 01:58:49.015]  We're good to go.
[01:58:49.035 --> 01:58:50.136]  We're good to go.
[01:58:50.697 --> 01:58:51.337]  We're good to go.
[01:58:51.417 --> 01:58:52.478]  We're good to go.
[01:59:10.574 --> 01:59:15.898]  Trump latest no tax on overtime and saying illegals won't get money for free mortgages.
[01:59:15.938 --> 01:59:17.880]  Yeah, those are great ideas on the economic front.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.282]  Strategy for Trump to overcome mainstream media.
[01:59:21.202 --> 01:59:26.286]  We'll also tellgatesfortrump.com the real effects of social media and actual voting.
[01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:28.147]  Trump not debating pros and cons.
[01:59:28.167 --> 01:59:30.990]  He says he's not now because ABC regularly still won.
[01:59:31.730 --> 01:59:33.570]  And now they got that whistleblower coming out, confirmed.
[01:59:33.590 --> 01:59:35.231]  The law firms have confirmed it is coming out.
[01:59:35.311 --> 01:59:36.171]  ABC whistleblower.
[01:59:36.631 --> 01:59:45.712]  But before we get to that and play clips of Trump on his new economic announcements that are pure genius, because the money from working-class folks in overtime doesn't run the country.
[01:59:45.753 --> 01:59:46.653]  They just print the crap.
[01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:47.733]  Okay?
[01:59:47.793 --> 01:59:48.673]  It's about social control.
[01:59:48.693 --> 01:59:49.293]  They admit that.
[01:59:49.713 --> 01:59:53.354]  But before we hit all those issues, Jeremy, great to have you from TheQuartering.com.
[01:59:53.374 --> 01:59:56.814]  They can find all your platforms and all the tens of millions you reach a day right there.
[01:59:57.195 --> 01:59:57.955]  Very exciting show.
[01:59:57.975 --> 01:59:59.355]  Been watching you for at least four years.
[02:00:00.885 --> 02:00:13.918]  World War III front and center, the Ukraine situation, the announcement that they're going to start bombing as early as this weekend, we hope to get them to have some sanity and not do it, with heavy cruise missiles directed by NATO and the U.S.
[02:00:13.998 --> 02:00:14.638]  inside Russia.
[02:00:14.678 --> 02:00:15.780]  Putin's saying that's an act of war.
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:19.823]  They'll officially be at war with NATO and take response in their threat doctrine.
[02:00:21.141 --> 02:00:25.943]  Which is bare minimum attack European targets where the missiles are being produced or shipped or stored.
[02:00:26.563 --> 02:00:28.884]  They're saying Poland might be the first target where they're coming through.
[02:00:28.904 --> 02:00:30.284]  Is this a message?
[02:00:30.484 --> 02:00:32.365]  They talked about a tactical nuke against Poland.
[02:00:32.945 --> 02:00:34.206]  I mean, this stuff is so crazy.
[02:00:34.246 --> 02:00:35.446]  I can't believe I'm even saying it.
[02:00:36.226 --> 02:00:41.728]  Just a year and a half ago, Biden said we can't ship F-16s or Abrams tanks because that's the threat escalation of World War III.
[02:00:42.088 --> 02:00:43.249]  Now we're way past that.
[02:00:43.729 --> 02:00:48.471]  What is your take on this as an American, just as a citizen, as somebody that lives on this planet?
[02:00:48.531 --> 02:00:49.071]  Great to have you here.
[02:00:50.336 --> 02:00:51.036]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:00:51.056 --> 02:00:52.217]  It's always fun to be on the show.
[02:00:52.237 --> 02:01:06.944]  Obviously very, very, very concerning to see yet another escalation in a war that should have been negotiated to completion a long time ago, something that I'm sure President Trump would have done.
[02:01:07.604 --> 02:01:12.446]  And I do agree with Trump saying that if he was still president, probably wouldn't have happened.
[02:01:13.066 --> 02:01:15.748]  If this escalation actually happens,
[02:01:16.958 --> 02:01:24.160]  I don't know how you don't say this is World War Three when you're talking about, you know, firing long range missiles into Russia.
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.420]  I mean, we're just at full scale war.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:36.903]  I mean, I think any most normie people understand that what we've got is essentially a proxy war between the United States and Russia using Ukraine the way it is.
[02:01:37.583 --> 02:01:43.769]  Now, if we're going to be firing long-range missiles in, how could you even blame Russia for retaliating at this point?
[02:01:44.169 --> 02:01:51.976]  I'm sure they'll call me a Russian operative or something, but I don't even understand how the normal person is supposed to say, well, dude, you just fired missiles into their country.
[02:01:52.517 --> 02:01:54.298]  Of course, things are going to escalate.
[02:01:54.739 --> 02:01:57.081]  And so it's extremely concerning.
[02:01:57.964 --> 02:02:05.766]  Never mind what's going on in Israel-Palestine, never mind what's brewing with Iran, all of this stuff, you know, you got Kamala Harris.
[02:02:05.786 --> 02:02:26.890]  I would just say, hey, if you're voting and you don't want your kids to go fight and die for someone else's fake war, maybe consider that on November 5th when you cast your vote, because Kamala Harris' presidency is probably going to force boots on the ground between Russia and Ukraine, or most likely in Iran and many more, and that's very concerning for me.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.141]  Perfectly said, better than I can say it.
[02:02:30.201 --> 02:02:32.762]  So, you're a smart cookie, I watch your show all the time.
[02:02:32.822 --> 02:02:54.929]  What do we do to stop this when we have a government that stole the election, tried to kill Trump, 325,000 missing kids, sex slavery, physical labor, slave labor, hundreds of thousands, fentanyl death, total bedlam, Haitians running around drinking cat's blood, raping people, grabbing little kids, running over kids at the school bus stops, and then you've got
[02:02:56.092 --> 02:03:00.136]  Hollywood idiots running around saying, hey, don't take nukes off the table.
[02:03:00.156 --> 02:03:01.297]  Sean Penn said that a year ago.
[02:03:01.377 --> 02:03:02.117]  Now it's happening.
[02:03:02.498 --> 02:03:03.879]  I mean, what the hell is going on?
[02:03:03.899 --> 02:03:05.821]  Do they want to commit collective suicide?
[02:03:06.121 --> 02:03:06.782]  How do we stop this?
[02:03:08.396 --> 02:03:10.657]  I think the answer is to continue to keep waking people up.
[02:03:11.137 --> 02:03:12.337]  Look what Donald Trump did today.
[02:03:12.557 --> 02:03:23.880]  He went into Kamala Harris's backyard and took a giant dump on her and dropped facts for about 20 straight minutes about the number of hundreds of thousands of missing traffic children that are in California alone.
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.100]  I believe it was in California, or maybe it's the total number.
[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:27.800]  People are waking up.
[02:03:28.441 --> 02:03:30.721]  And I think that we have to continue to do that.
[02:03:31.201 --> 02:03:34.182]  I think that there is a movement between independent voters
[02:03:35.129 --> 02:03:39.454]  And Republicans, we saw this during the debate, where they're kind of along the same thing.
[02:03:39.514 --> 02:03:49.624]  People are becoming more aware of, hey, you shipped 30,000 immigrants into a town of 60,000, and it's completely destroyed the town.
[02:03:50.345 --> 02:03:50.625]  I don't know.
[02:04:06.192 --> 02:04:08.714]  And taking the ducks just for their protection.
[02:04:08.734 --> 02:04:12.217]  Because I don't want any people down there eating them.
[02:04:12.698 --> 02:04:13.979]  You know, I never thought of that.
[02:04:14.419 --> 02:04:17.802]  Like, 15 years ago, somebody just made up this fake Alex Jones quote.
[02:04:18.262 --> 02:04:20.984]  Hey, you know, the ducks at the park are free.
[02:04:21.505 --> 02:04:22.526]  And that's associated with me.
[02:04:22.586 --> 02:04:23.426]  I never said it.
[02:04:23.446 --> 02:04:24.848]  And it's one of the biggest memes ever.
[02:04:25.368 --> 02:04:26.729]  And now they're actually taking the ducks home.
[02:04:26.769 --> 02:04:28.671]  It's like they got my advice that I never gave.
[02:04:28.711 --> 02:04:28.931]  Yeah.
[02:04:29.812 --> 02:04:30.813]  It's very concerning.
[02:04:31.713 --> 02:04:32.374]  And I think that
[02:04:33.445 --> 02:04:35.246]  People need to continue to get woken up.
[02:04:35.287 --> 02:04:37.128]  I think we need to be careful with the messaging.
[02:04:38.749 --> 02:04:50.238]  I see a lot of messaging like, I don't think they're eating the dogs or eating the cats necessarily hits as hard or like all immigrants bad kind of thing.
[02:04:50.318 --> 02:04:52.700]  I think if Republicans and Trump can stick to the
[02:04:53.604 --> 02:04:54.144]  Statistics.
[02:04:54.164 --> 02:04:55.565]  I don't know if you have them handy.
[02:04:55.785 --> 02:04:56.625]  You almost always do.
[02:04:57.145 --> 02:05:06.488]  But if you look at the rise in HIV and other communicable diseases in that town, the rise in car insurance, the rise in the hospital.
[02:05:06.508 --> 02:05:07.529]  You can't get into the hospital.
[02:05:07.549 --> 02:05:15.411]  It's bankrupting the local system 100% and the governor's sending money and cops to write tickets, which isn't what you need to do to deport them.
[02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:15.952]  No, absolutely.
[02:05:16.252 --> 02:05:20.273]  Double the car insurance, massive wrecks, not just in that town, all around there.
[02:05:20.313 --> 02:05:20.973]  It's the Haitians.
[02:05:20.993 --> 02:05:22.074]  They don't even get driver's license.
[02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:22.874]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:05:23.806 --> 02:05:31.414]  And I think one of my key things that I try to tell people is stay away from blaming the Haitians.
[02:05:32.495 --> 02:05:36.780]  Look, a lot of these people, they do voodoo, they do this stuff.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:41.825]  When people say there's cats missing or there's pigs in the park, I guarantee you, I'm firmly in belief that
[02:05:42.546 --> 02:05:45.350]  They did some sort of voodoo thing with it and that's why it's there.
[02:05:45.911 --> 02:05:53.984]  But if people can stay off the Haitians bad stuff and just talk about what it's doing to the local economy and the fact that it is absolutely crushing
[02:05:54.597 --> 02:05:57.199]  People on the poverty line and people in the middle of the class.
[02:05:57.599 --> 02:05:58.159]  In the middle class.
[02:05:58.239 --> 02:06:04.063]  If you look at who's the ones making these viral TikTok videos, Alex, it's not snooty.
[02:06:05.564 --> 02:06:07.065]  It's black people.
[02:06:07.665 --> 02:06:12.448]  It's black people from the inner cities that are like, what the hell is going on?
[02:06:12.828 --> 02:06:13.489]  Exactly.
[02:06:13.849 --> 02:06:14.149]  They are.
[02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:15.530]  And then and then there was someone.
[02:06:16.610 --> 02:06:18.732]  Tyler Hanson did some excellent on the ground reporting.
[02:06:19.497 --> 02:06:22.879]  And he appeared to be interviewing a lot of people in an area that looked pretty rough.
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:26.681]  You know, look, poverty doesn't care about race.
[02:06:27.722 --> 02:06:35.666]  And there's a lot of people who are in need of government assistance that are now getting pushed out of their homes because landlords are like, oh, the U.S.
[02:06:35.706 --> 02:06:42.069]  government will pay me triple what this person who's just barely getting by will pay me, and they're pushing him out.
[02:06:43.911 --> 02:06:55.438]  Donald Trump and the mainstream media and the narrative, including you and myself, not mainstream, but the alt media, we talk about that, that hits way harder than they're eating the cats.
[02:06:55.978 --> 02:06:57.979]  So if we say, look, they're destroying these towns.
[02:06:58.519 --> 02:07:00.280]  They can't, you know, this, yes.
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:01.701]  Great interview here from Tyler.
[02:07:02.482 --> 02:07:05.583]  The shout out to your B-roll team, your production team.
[02:07:05.963 --> 02:07:10.626]  He's interviewing people who, I mean, look, I can look at this and say, this is not someone who's living in a mansion.
[02:07:10.726 --> 02:07:12.047]  I don't mean any disrespect by it.
[02:07:12.816 --> 02:07:16.937]  But what they're telling you, Tyler, is like, I need food stamps still.
[02:07:17.798 --> 02:07:21.779]  The Haitians are calling their cards magic money cards because they never run out of money.
[02:07:21.799 --> 02:07:22.199]  Let's be clear.
[02:07:22.219 --> 02:07:26.521]  They're giving locals 70-something dollars a month, 76, black, white, doesn't matter.
[02:07:27.221 --> 02:07:30.522]  And then they're giving them 1,000 local and 3,000 federal.
[02:07:30.862 --> 02:07:36.724]  And the Haitians are all in brand new clothes, driving around in nice cars, and don't even have jobs.
[02:07:36.844 --> 02:07:38.085]  And they're just totally out of it.
[02:07:38.205 --> 02:07:38.545]  Here's the deal.
[02:07:39.534 --> 02:07:42.396]  Look, Haiti is the most failed state in the world.
[02:07:42.777 --> 02:07:49.843]  It's been a slave colony for 300 years, and it's all deforested, and it's 95% illegitimacy.
[02:07:49.963 --> 02:07:50.683]  It's hell on earth.
[02:07:51.084 --> 02:07:52.385]  Christian Haitians are great people.
[02:07:52.425 --> 02:07:57.970]  They're the ones online going, look out, these people do do this, you don't want them here.
[02:07:58.050 --> 02:08:01.593]  And the truth is, the Haitians on average are completely feral.
[02:08:02.193 --> 02:08:12.399]  So so and and by farrell you could take a bunch of white people and throw them out on an island and have no civilization and over hundreds of years it could turn into like you know barbarian world and but the point is is that
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.982]  Haiti is an open-air lunatic asylum.
[02:08:16.603 --> 02:08:18.585]  And now you're going to bring a bunch of them here.
[02:08:18.685 --> 02:08:19.326]  It doesn't work.
[02:08:19.626 --> 02:08:21.288]  It's one thing if they're Christians that flee.
[02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:22.129]  It's funny.
[02:08:22.349 --> 02:08:24.592]  If they're Christian, they're nice and hard-working and statistically good people.
[02:08:24.872 --> 02:08:26.373]  If they're devil worshippers, you got a problem.
[02:08:26.994 --> 02:08:28.115]  We're bringing them out of there.
[02:08:28.155 --> 02:08:30.177]  I mean, there's an island of white devil worshippers.
[02:08:30.498 --> 02:08:32.380]  You don't bring, oh, let's bring the devil worshipper.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:33.221]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:08:34.397 --> 02:08:37.458]  Yeah, so I mean, I think when you start to connect the dots, people are seeing that
[02:09:03.376 --> 02:09:09.639]  This is destroying the, not even the middle class, but it's like people who are struggling to get by.
[02:09:09.659 --> 02:09:18.963]  And, you know, whether or not they're eating their pets doesn't matter as much as they're literally getting pushed out of their homes that they can barely already afford.
[02:09:18.983 --> 02:09:23.786]  So you're probably making a lot of these people homeless who have lived in this town forever.
[02:09:24.246 --> 02:09:26.447]  And what's going to happen when that government money runs out?
[02:09:27.607 --> 02:09:44.961]  Now you're going to basically have a 20,000 person ghetto, 30,000 person ghetto, you're going to have all the Haitians that are broke, and you're going to have all the original people that live there who are broke, and it's going to be- Well that was my next question, because Europe is run by the same NGOs, they're just 15 years ahead of us.
[02:09:45.461 --> 02:09:48.002]  They brought in 30 million, mainly Islamists and North Africans.
[02:09:48.382 --> 02:09:58.645]  After three years, they cut the money off to them and only let them get the local welfare, and then that always bankrupts things, and then the blue cities collapse, and they move to the red, and now that's what Biden-Harris is doing.
[02:09:58.905 --> 02:09:59.845]  The blue's already collapsed.
[02:09:59.865 --> 02:10:05.027]  They're now not just shipping the illegals that they brought in there, but the refugees of the blue cities are now coming to the red cities.
[02:10:05.307 --> 02:10:06.787]  So it's a takedown plan of the country.
[02:10:07.867 --> 02:10:12.989]  Yeah, I mean, you can see that with immigration, internal immigration in the United States between California and Texas and California.
[02:10:13.735 --> 02:10:14.176]  We're good to go.
[02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:31.169]  No, it is.
[02:10:31.889 --> 02:10:32.690]  Like, they know.
[02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:38.932]  And Gavin Newscombe, as he calls them, you know, even he's like, oh, we're going to crack down on the homeless problem.
[02:10:38.992 --> 02:10:39.852]  Yeah, right.
[02:10:40.352 --> 02:10:42.232]  This has been a systemic problem.
[02:10:42.833 --> 02:10:50.035]  This is a guy who got billions to solve the homeless problem, build them houses, and did absolutely nothing with it.
[02:10:50.595 --> 02:10:56.937]  There's a huge homeless industrial complex where billions of dollars go into government funding
[02:10:57.637 --> 02:11:01.819]  For these associations and companies that are supposed to get people off the streets.
[02:11:02.499 --> 02:11:03.039]  They don't.
[02:11:03.459 --> 02:11:07.021]  They don't get people off drugs because drug addicts need to want to quit.
[02:11:07.201 --> 02:11:10.222]  You can't just throw money at a drug addict and think they're going to quit doing drugs.
[02:11:10.803 --> 02:11:13.524]  And there's a huge business that not a lot of people know about.
[02:11:13.604 --> 02:11:14.884]  Your audience probably knows about it.
[02:11:15.605 --> 02:11:20.447]  A huge multi, multi, multi hundred million dollar industry around the homeless.
[02:11:20.907 --> 02:11:22.407]  The same is true for these Haitians.
[02:11:22.868 --> 02:11:25.569]  Here's how it works in Springfield, Ohio, from what I understand.
[02:11:26.573 --> 02:11:28.034]  There is a staffing agency.
[02:11:28.855 --> 02:11:33.098]  That staffing agency employs some massive percentage of these Haitians.
[02:11:34.078 --> 02:11:37.000]  A local person who lives there said 90%, but that's anecdotal.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.001]  But it's a huge percent.
[02:11:38.882 --> 02:11:40.263]  What do staffing agencies do?
[02:11:40.703 --> 02:11:42.764]  Well, they place these people in work.
[02:11:42.925 --> 02:11:44.145]  They make sure they go to work.
[02:11:44.726 --> 02:11:46.267]  And then they cut 10%, 15%, 20% off the top
[02:11:49.471 --> 02:11:50.231]  Of their paychecks.
[02:12:17.093 --> 02:12:18.354]  I'm listening to you.
[02:12:18.414 --> 02:12:19.915]  You're absolutely dead on.
[02:12:19.955 --> 02:12:21.096]  I've been exposing this for decades.
[02:12:34.912 --> 02:12:40.094]  You have these UN NGOs, the main one that came over here that's been running the invasion since Obama was in.
[02:12:40.174 --> 02:12:42.716]  Trump kind of shut it down, 95%, but it was still operating.
[02:12:43.496 --> 02:12:52.020]  And they have these law firms, and they take in the illegals from all over the world, they get them jobs, and they send them for welfare, and then they skim the top off of the welfare check and off the check.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:54.101]  That goes to the Democratic Party and these mafias.
[02:12:54.801 --> 02:12:59.326]  And then they get more federal money and then set them up in houses to then bring their families here.
[02:12:59.406 --> 02:13:08.095]  And then when that town collapses, they literally then move them to another town and they're bombing the few little Republican holdout towns to flip them.
[02:13:08.235 --> 02:13:09.857]  And now they've caught them in voting scams.
[02:13:09.897 --> 02:13:11.598]  I mean, this is very strategic.
[02:13:11.618 --> 02:13:12.539]  So you cut off the money.
[02:13:14.191 --> 02:13:20.517]  You deport the military age men particularly, and you prosecute them for the human trafficking and other crimes, and it shuts down.
[02:13:21.077 --> 02:13:23.940]  But instead, the Republican governor's like, we'll send money, we'll send money.
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:32.768]  That's adding, if you have bears breaking into your garage or house, or bears in your backyard in the trash can, you don't start feeding them, that makes more bears come.
[02:13:33.489 --> 02:13:35.331]  That's why the homeless think it's worse and worse and worse.
[02:13:36.107 --> 02:13:37.088]  That's what they want, Alex, right?
[02:13:37.108 --> 02:13:39.889]  Because then they're going to say, they get them hooked on the money, right?
[02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:41.991]  So what's the next thing they say to them?
[02:13:42.491 --> 02:13:43.371]  Oh, it's an election year.
[02:13:44.152 --> 02:13:45.593]  You know who's going to take your money away?
[02:13:47.054 --> 02:13:49.535]  This guy, Donald Trump's going to take your money away.
[02:13:50.056 --> 02:13:51.216]  So we're going to send a bus.
[02:13:51.636 --> 02:13:53.878]  We're going to pick you all up on your way to work.
[02:13:54.098 --> 02:13:55.339]  We're going to stop and we're going to vote.
[02:13:56.038 --> 02:14:00.943]  There's a reason that they put 30,000 of them in an overwhelmingly Trump-leaning city.
[02:14:01.624 --> 02:14:03.506]  They want to flip the vote.
[02:14:04.206 --> 02:14:13.175]  Here's all this free money from the government, and then down the line they're going to say, oh, well, the bad guy, Orange Man, is going to take it away from whoever the next presidential candidate is.
[02:14:13.816 --> 02:14:15.317]  They've been doing this with inner cities.
[02:14:16.326 --> 02:14:18.468]  In democratic strongholds for 50 years.
[02:14:19.289 --> 02:14:20.390]  Oh, they're going to take your welfare away.
[02:14:20.410 --> 02:14:21.010]  You've got to vote.
[02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.811]  Got to vote.
[02:14:21.851 --> 02:14:22.191]  Got to vote.
[02:14:22.211 --> 02:14:23.252]  They're going to take your welfare.
[02:14:23.292 --> 02:14:26.254]  Oh, hey, Mr. Haitian, you like that $6,000 a month?
[02:14:26.495 --> 02:14:27.315]  Well, you can keep that.
[02:14:27.656 --> 02:14:29.577]  Just make sure we'll pick you up.
[02:14:30.038 --> 02:14:35.002]  We'll fill out your application for you, allegedly, and we'll carry you in or we'll get you to vote.
[02:14:35.582 --> 02:14:37.163]  That's the long-term game.
[02:14:37.184 --> 02:14:42.348]  That's the long-term plan, is to destroy the Republican Party and maintain essentially
[02:14:42.995 --> 02:14:55.402]  Complete control with combined with basically an infinite money glitch Alex where they can just I mean there's an infinite number of people who are willing to come to America and live for free so they just have an infinite if it's not if it's not um
[02:14:56.334 --> 02:14:57.375]  Katie, it'll be Somalia.
[02:14:57.395 --> 02:14:58.997]  If it's not Somalia, it'll be the Dominican.
[02:14:59.037 --> 02:15:00.578]  If it's not the Dominican, it'll be Nigeria.
[02:15:00.598 --> 02:15:12.589]  If it's not Nigeria, it'll be... They have an unlimited supply of these people that they can continue just rinse and repeat the same methodology that they've been doing with the inner city communities for the past 20 years.
[02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:16.453]  They ran out of inner city people, so now they're just bringing in migrants.
[02:15:16.513 --> 02:15:17.554]  It's the same playbook.
[02:15:19.215 --> 02:15:19.916]  How do we stop it?
[02:15:22.290 --> 02:15:25.433]  Well, you've got to shut the border down and you've got to stop the immigration.
[02:15:26.133 --> 02:15:35.961]  I think that you have to have a strong leader who's, first of all, you know, I don't know if Trump's really going to pull off, you know, deporting 30, 20, 30 million illegals.
[02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:43.207]  But you've got to deport these people as uncomfortable as maybe that makes people because they're not all bad, right?
[02:15:43.227 --> 02:15:44.268]  They're not all bad people.
[02:15:45.336 --> 02:15:46.016]  You gotta do that.
[02:15:46.317 --> 02:15:47.297]  I mean, here's what I'll say.
[02:15:47.317 --> 02:15:49.219]  Well, I'm about to say it's a globalist operation.
[02:15:49.419 --> 02:15:51.860]  You gotta deport those that are here to stop more coming.
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:54.022]  You can't give them a chance to stay illegally.
[02:15:54.262 --> 02:15:55.503]  You gotta ship them all back.
[02:15:55.783 --> 02:15:56.203]  All of them.
[02:15:56.904 --> 02:15:58.085]  I like Poland's plan.
[02:15:59.045 --> 02:16:00.366]  I like what Poland does, Alex.
[02:16:01.347 --> 02:16:02.147]  I'm pretty sure.
[02:16:02.688 --> 02:16:07.571]  Poland, I believe, has taken a grand total of zero migrants.
[02:16:07.991 --> 02:16:09.232]  I believe that number is zero.
[02:16:10.853 --> 02:16:11.414]  I like that.
[02:16:12.489 --> 02:16:14.209]  I like saying, hey, you know what?
[02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:17.470]  When we don't have any more homeless veterans, we'll talk about bringing in immigrants.
[02:16:18.051 --> 02:16:26.933]  When we don't have 100,000 Americans, a football stadium full of Americans dying from fentanyl every year, I'll talk about the Haitians.
[02:16:27.433 --> 02:16:31.114]  When we don't have a broken VA system, I'll talk about Haitians.
[02:16:31.434 --> 02:16:37.476]  When we don't have 50 million Americans at or below the poverty line, I'll talk about the Haitians.
[02:16:37.916 --> 02:16:38.896]  It's so simple.
[02:16:39.476 --> 02:16:41.597]  We need leadership that will be strong.
[02:16:42.566 --> 02:16:46.767]  That's kind of this new mega movement in the Republican Party.
[02:16:46.787 --> 02:16:48.148]  We need to get rid of these rhinos.
[02:16:49.308 --> 02:16:50.608]  They're slowly getting removed.
[02:16:50.648 --> 02:16:52.889]  We need more people who are going to be America first.
[02:16:52.949 --> 02:16:54.449]  And that's why the deep state's so panicked.
[02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:57.590]  We, our beachhead of Trump, is getting better and larger.
[02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.631]  I totally agree.
[02:16:58.671 --> 02:17:00.071]  How do you think the deep state's going to strike back?
[02:17:00.091 --> 02:17:01.411]  I mean, they've already tried to kill him.
[02:17:02.112 --> 02:17:03.752]  They're going to try to kill Trump again, I think.
[02:17:04.192 --> 02:17:08.193]  If I was a betting man, I think they're going to take another, there's going to be another incident.
[02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:09.714]  Almost certainly.
[02:17:11.468 --> 02:17:15.752]  And I think, by the way, people, it starts at your local elections.
[02:17:16.713 --> 02:17:17.974]  It's not just about the president.
[02:17:18.054 --> 02:17:19.175]  It's down ballot.
[02:17:19.755 --> 02:17:22.598]  Be careful about who you're voting in for Republicans.
[02:17:23.278 --> 02:17:28.943]  Be careful about who you're voting in in local government, state government, your people in Congress.
[02:17:29.724 --> 02:17:35.289]  These are the people that are approving these ridiculous omnibus spending bills.
[02:17:36.246 --> 02:17:45.451]  Where, you know, let's send another six billion to Ukraine so that a couple of rhino Republicans can get some more surveillance on Americans.
[02:17:45.491 --> 02:17:46.711]  I'm just saying that hypothetically.
[02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:49.873]  But if you watch these bills, these people are working together.
[02:17:50.970 --> 02:17:52.271]  It's going to take a lifetime, Alex.
[02:17:53.072 --> 02:18:01.517]  You and I will probably be long gone, but people have to start voting better down ballot and keep the corruption under check.
[02:18:01.577 --> 02:18:02.258]  I totally agree.
[02:18:02.298 --> 02:18:03.899]  Breaking news here.
[02:18:03.979 --> 02:18:08.242]  We have Jeremy with TheQuartering.com, very popular analyst, talk show host, and gamer.
[02:18:08.903 --> 02:18:13.126]  Trudeau, who says he loves dictatorship and wants to force inject kids and arrest people for free speech.
[02:18:13.906 --> 02:18:19.429]  Says he, quote, fully supports Ukraine using NATO long-range missiles on Russia the day after Putin said it would spark World War III.
[02:18:19.769 --> 02:18:21.510]  I mean, these people are maniacs.
[02:18:21.571 --> 02:18:27.054]  The left are now piranha-faced, crazy maniacs that want to kill us all.
[02:18:28.475 --> 02:18:31.997]  There's nothing more controlling than war and fear.
[02:18:33.177 --> 02:18:35.739]  And, you know, escalating a war with Russia.
[02:18:36.099 --> 02:18:39.401]  Yeah, it's big talk from Canada and there's 17 military people.
[02:18:39.921 --> 02:18:41.222]  I mean, I think that, like,
[02:18:41.986 --> 02:18:51.372]  Maybe Canada should be sending some people to the front lines then, rather than NATO, who most of which don't pay their dues, are going to turn to America.
[02:18:51.712 --> 02:18:55.054]  And then we're going to have crappy leaders that are like, well, what are we supposed to do?
[02:18:55.474 --> 02:18:59.176]  Russia counterattacked, and they bombed sites.
[02:18:59.456 --> 02:18:59.837]  You know what?
[02:19:00.337 --> 02:19:05.180]  My position has been, and I know we're going to break soon, my position has been, and will always be,
[02:19:06.395 --> 02:19:07.519]  Let Europe take care of it.
[02:19:07.921 --> 02:19:09.567]  Literally for once, Alex.
[02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:11.294]  Literally for once.
[02:19:12.213 --> 02:19:13.294]  Let Europe take care of it.
[02:19:13.374 --> 02:19:13.994]  I totally agree.
[02:19:14.034 --> 02:19:14.835]  We have enough problems.
[02:19:14.995 --> 02:19:19.337]  We have enough problems in America that let Europe take care of it.
[02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:20.778]  They've got plenty of military.
[02:19:20.958 --> 02:19:22.239]  All right, Jeremy with The Quartering.
[02:19:22.259 --> 02:19:26.962]  We're going to come back with huge breaking news, a bunch of Trump clips that just happened that I missed the press conference.
[02:19:27.082 --> 02:19:30.023]  It is just, I mean, I've been on air 30 years.
[02:19:30.484 --> 02:19:32.665]  We have more news in a day now than we would have in a year before.
[02:19:32.745 --> 02:19:40.129]  I mean, it's all just world government, you and announcing casual society, promoting pedophilia, just bonkers, crazy town.
[02:19:40.149 --> 02:19:40.790]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:40.810 --> 02:19:41.250]  Stay with us.
[02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:46.531]  Everybody should go to Infowarsphone.com right now.
[02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:48.151]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:19:48.411 --> 02:19:56.873]  They have all the solar panels, all the charging stations, all the best sat phones, all the best sat radios, all the best equipment at the best prices, and they support the broadcast.
[02:19:57.333 --> 02:19:59.093]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:19:59.193 --> 02:20:01.954]  I think it's a default move to do this.
[02:20:02.454 --> 02:20:07.655]  It's an absolute essential, and it is so important to get ready, and I'm telling myself that.
[02:20:08.055 --> 02:20:12.418]  If there's an EMP attack, your cell phone's just nothing but a brick, right?
[02:20:12.798 --> 02:20:20.383]  And I know that even in the law enforcement part of it, that when people are, you know, run their phone, they can turn their phone off for 72 hours.
[02:20:20.483 --> 02:20:24.066]  Somebody in our group can ping that phone and track that phone for 72 hours.
[02:20:24.666 --> 02:20:25.747]  So you're not off the grid.
[02:20:26.827 --> 02:20:28.929]  So, make sure you get your Faraday's sleeve.
[02:20:29.529 --> 02:20:30.950]  Have a sat phone as a backup.
[02:20:31.290 --> 02:20:35.814]  If you're concerned about secure messaging, the black phone will secure end-to-end encryption.
[02:20:36.514 --> 02:20:40.777]  Everybody should go to InfoWarsPhone.com right now.
[02:20:40.797 --> 02:20:46.241]  All right, got another 25 minutes with the amazing host of The Quartering.
[02:20:47.502 --> 02:20:53.727]  And then we are going to be talking to Jack Posobiec with massive political developments inside Intel and what really happened.
[02:20:55.128 --> 02:20:57.049]  I'm not covering this issue because I'm covering it.
[02:20:57.069 --> 02:20:58.370]  I'm covering it to point out our problems.
[02:21:21.109 --> 02:21:22.850]  You have World War III imminently.
[02:21:22.890 --> 02:21:25.452]  They can start bombing Russia, directed by the U.S.
[02:21:25.512 --> 02:21:28.054]  and NATO, with high-tech precision weapons.
[02:21:28.074 --> 02:21:29.155]  Putin says it's an act of war.
[02:21:29.175 --> 02:21:31.037]  He'll consider it as a war with the United States of America.
[02:21:31.297 --> 02:21:31.937]  That's never happened.
[02:21:32.017 --> 02:21:32.818]  Official war with Russia.
[02:21:33.418 --> 02:21:34.759]  That's World War III, as Jeremy said earlier.
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:37.241]  You got Trudeau saying he supports it.
[02:21:37.261 --> 02:21:39.583]  We got that clip just minutes ago.
[02:21:39.603 --> 02:21:40.824]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:41.965 --> 02:21:49.391]  We've got open borders, hundreds of thousands of missing children, all this insanity going on, jobless numbers coming out, even worse than they said.
[02:21:50.677 --> 02:21:51.599]  Price is exploding.
[02:21:51.639 --> 02:21:52.220]  I've got that.
[02:21:53.061 --> 02:21:54.303]  All the red lights are flashing.
[02:21:54.464 --> 02:21:58.370]  I mean, if this was, you know, a nuclear reactor, everything's flashing.
[02:21:58.410 --> 02:21:58.971]  It's melting down.
[02:22:00.254 --> 02:22:04.235]  And without even looking, it's all over the news, every news channel.
[02:22:04.655 --> 02:22:05.996]  Laura Loomer's horrible.
[02:22:06.116 --> 02:22:06.896]  She questioned 9-11.
[02:22:07.036 --> 02:22:08.276]  I'm not saying she's horrible.
[02:22:08.937 --> 02:22:09.957]  She's a terrible person.
[02:22:09.977 --> 02:22:11.277]  She's secretly Trump's brain.
[02:22:11.677 --> 02:22:12.798]  MTG is upset.
[02:22:13.378 --> 02:22:15.318]  And the campaign is in crisis.
[02:22:15.338 --> 02:22:16.299]  That's what they're saying.
[02:22:16.319 --> 02:22:18.259]  There's a civil war.
[02:22:18.439 --> 02:22:19.360]  She doesn't run anything.
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:20.640]  She's a journalist.
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:24.981]  Trump lets her fly with the other journalists from CNN on the plane.
[02:22:27.142 --> 02:22:27.262]  And
[02:22:28.854 --> 02:22:34.835]  Trump is at a press conference covering all these super hardcore issues and he's talking about this.
[02:22:35.735 --> 02:22:43.917]  They did this with me in 2016 and made it all about me, but I wasn't engaging in it and explained that day one.
[02:22:44.517 --> 02:22:45.757]  So I want to play these two Trump clips.
[02:22:45.797 --> 02:22:49.558]  Here's Trump talking about the 300 plus thousand missing children.
[02:22:49.598 --> 02:22:52.499]  He should say, we're going to find him and we're going to prosecute Mayorkas and
[02:22:53.567 --> 02:22:53.847]  Her.
[02:22:53.967 --> 02:22:55.348]  That should be one of his central.
[02:22:55.388 --> 02:22:56.189]  He's very close now.
[02:22:56.209 --> 02:23:00.431]  As I said, he used the analogy of three and a quarter sports stadiums full of kids.
[02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:03.093]  Jumbo, 100,000-person sports stadiums.
[02:23:03.333 --> 02:23:05.314]  He did that there, but didn't go the rest of the thing.
[02:23:05.655 --> 02:23:06.835]  And I got this info to him.
[02:23:07.036 --> 02:23:08.376]  And I've been pushing him hard, as you know.
[02:23:08.957 --> 02:23:12.179]  So it shows we can get things done, but he still should make this a bigger carve-out.
[02:23:13.139 --> 02:23:17.302]  He spent 42 seconds on the missing kids and 42 seconds on Laura Loomer.
[02:23:17.542 --> 02:23:18.523]  Let's play these back to back.
[02:23:19.468 --> 02:23:28.313]  Now as vice president, she's facilitated the largest wave of sex trafficking and human trafficking in history, the history of our country by far.
[02:23:29.954 --> 02:23:40.261]  And in case you don't want to write about it, which you should because it can be no bigger scandal than this, we have under this administration, 325,000 migrant children are missing.
[02:23:40.281 --> 02:23:40.261]  325,000.
[02:23:40.441 --> 02:23:41.301]  In other words, take
[02:23:50.066 --> 02:23:55.227]  Your biggest stadium in California and you could fill it up five or six times.
[02:23:55.647 --> 02:23:57.968]  Those are all missing children.
[02:23:58.488 --> 02:23:59.568]  Many of them are dead.
[02:24:00.408 --> 02:24:04.549]  Many of them are sex slaves and slaves of different nature.
[02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:06.190]  Go ahead.
[02:24:06.930 --> 02:24:07.250]  Go ahead.
[02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:12.291]  Republican allies who are concerned about your close relationship with Laura Loomer.
[02:24:13.365 --> 02:24:15.227]  Well, I don't know what they would say.
[02:24:15.587 --> 02:24:21.472]  Laura's been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters, and she's been a supporter of mine.
[02:24:21.992 --> 02:24:25.095]  She speaks very positively of the campaign.
[02:24:25.135 --> 02:24:28.278]  I'm not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter.
[02:24:29.915 --> 02:24:30.976]  I don't control Laura.
[02:24:31.016 --> 02:24:32.917]  Laura has to say what she wants.
[02:24:33.317 --> 02:24:34.298]  She's a free spirit.
[02:24:34.938 --> 02:24:35.439]  Well, I don't know.
[02:24:35.479 --> 02:24:37.560]  I mean, look, I can't tell Laura what to do.
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:38.480]  Laura's a supporter.
[02:24:38.941 --> 02:24:40.262]  I have a lot of supporters.
[02:24:42.363 --> 02:24:44.904]  So I don't know what exactly you're referring to.
[02:24:44.924 --> 02:24:46.766]  That's okay.
[02:24:47.946 --> 02:24:49.728]  So we're on the verge of total nuclear war.
[02:24:49.748 --> 02:24:51.028]  Even mainstream news admits that.
[02:24:51.409 --> 02:24:56.212]  And we're talking about a journalist, an independent journalist that is with the press gaggle.
[02:24:57.324 --> 02:24:59.986]  I mean, this is what the left's got, Jeremy, from the quartering.
[02:25:02.307 --> 02:25:05.670]  Yeah, I mean, I think they're grasping at straws right now.
[02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:07.871]  Laura Loomer is a bit of a firebrand.
[02:25:08.692 --> 02:25:13.114]  She has said some wild stuff, but she's also done some incredible reporting.
[02:25:13.135 --> 02:25:15.096]  I have a good relationship with Laura.
[02:25:15.596 --> 02:25:16.977]  Many people do until they don't.
[02:25:17.557 --> 02:25:18.478]  She's a bit fiery.
[02:25:18.518 --> 02:25:19.679]  I think she would admit that.
[02:25:20.379 --> 02:25:21.780]  But she's a fierce Trump supporter.
[02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:28.392]  I think the left media, the left wing media, really doesn't have any more attack vectors against Trump, do they?
[02:25:29.252 --> 02:25:31.473]  I mean, they've been saying Orange Man bad since 2012.
[02:25:31.973 --> 02:25:34.653]  You know, 2012, 2014.
[02:25:35.554 --> 02:25:36.994]  What can you really say about Trump anymore?
[02:25:37.394 --> 02:25:38.914]  There's nothing else that they can come out with.
[02:25:39.474 --> 02:25:41.075]  So now they're going to attack their supporters.
[02:25:41.635 --> 02:25:45.496]  I don't know if you followed this story, but, you know, we're still waiting for more information.
[02:25:46.256 --> 02:25:50.557]  But they managed to, the Department of Justice smeared most of the top, many of the top,
[02:25:51.451 --> 02:25:59.713]  Trump advocate content creators and journalists as, you know, Kremlin ops, even though the Department of Justice said they were all victims in it all.
[02:26:00.196 --> 02:26:02.196]  You know, they had, you know, they're going after Tim Pool.
[02:26:02.216 --> 02:26:03.417]  They're going after Benny Johnson.
[02:26:04.077 --> 02:26:05.177]  Oh, they're all Russian assets.
[02:26:05.217 --> 02:26:11.158]  Yeah, Tenet Media, the Russian company, put 10 million into media ad buys and was syndicating some shows.
[02:26:11.218 --> 02:26:13.459]  I mean, one of the globals put billions into these elections.
[02:26:13.899 --> 02:26:17.039]  And of course, the people that took, you know, the advertising stuff didn't even know it was happening.
[02:26:17.259 --> 02:26:20.920]  And they're acting like they, you know, they busted, you know, the Soviet army invading.
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:21.800]  Absolutely.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.441]  It's all total, complete grasping at straws.
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:32.963]  And they had no evidence, by the way, that they presented any way that any of these content creators were told to say anything that they wouldn't have normally said.
[02:26:33.603 --> 02:26:35.484]  The whole thing glowed like crazy.
[02:26:36.204 --> 02:26:43.908]  And, you know, I don't understand exactly why, you know, why people fall for it.
[02:26:44.368 --> 02:26:46.569]  But it's because they have no way to attack Trump anymore.
[02:26:47.156 --> 02:26:51.740]  They just can only attack his surrogates now.
[02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:53.901]  I'm not writing myself into the story.
[02:26:54.402 --> 02:27:01.387]  In the last 24 hours, I've had AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, CNN, ABC News.
[02:27:02.088 --> 02:27:03.329]  I can't even keep track of it in my email.
[02:27:03.849 --> 02:27:10.135]  Say, we're doing an investigation on right-wingers causing violence and we've got people that are connected to violence and connected to things to you.
[02:27:10.155 --> 02:27:11.235]  Would you like to respond?
[02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:14.278]  So exactly, the new thing is I'm causing violence.
[02:27:14.658 --> 02:27:15.859]  That's going to be all over the news now.
[02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:18.442]  I had Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey attacking me last night.
[02:27:18.462 --> 02:27:19.563]  A bunch of other shows attacking me.
[02:27:19.843 --> 02:27:20.684]  I mean, yeah, exactly.
[02:27:20.724 --> 02:27:22.005]  They're now shifting to his supporters.
[02:27:23.726 --> 02:27:29.451]  Yeah, you know, there's more tools than ever now, though, for people to fight back against a lot of these things.
[02:27:29.531 --> 02:27:31.093]  It's nice that obviously Elon bought X.
[02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:38.027]  A lot of real-time fact-checking is happening on X so that they can't do these type of things.
[02:27:38.627 --> 02:27:40.528]  You have apps out there like Veebs, for example.
[02:27:40.889 --> 02:27:49.274]  That's an app that lets you scan a product's UPC code and figure out if the company's woke or who they donate money to.
[02:27:51.055 --> 02:27:51.856]  People are using that.
[02:27:52.754 --> 02:27:59.537]  There's been a million tools out there that are arming us to fight back a lot of this stuff.
[02:27:59.577 --> 02:28:04.980]  So, you know, yes, Facebook and Instagram are still compromised.
[02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:06.841]  But look at sites like Rumble.
[02:28:07.181 --> 02:28:09.082]  Look at what you've done with your own Bandit video.
[02:28:09.582 --> 02:28:16.805]  Look what, you know, there's more and more opportunities out there for people to fight back against this.
[02:28:17.246 --> 02:28:19.407]  But the left is, you know, what are they?
[02:28:19.447 --> 02:28:19.987]  What's the saying?
[02:28:20.007 --> 02:28:20.927]  It's an animal.
[02:28:22.268 --> 02:28:26.149]  Nothing more dangerous than a cornered animal or an animal like in its death throes.
[02:28:26.829 --> 02:28:28.729]  That's what we're seeing with the machine.
[02:28:29.249 --> 02:28:36.391]  They've never been less powerful right now, thanks to the work that you're doing, thanks to the work that independent news people are doing.
[02:28:36.431 --> 02:28:41.231]  And so the only thing left they have to do, that they can do, they can't say Orange Man bad anymore.
[02:28:41.271 --> 02:28:42.392]  They can't say Trump did this.
[02:28:42.412 --> 02:28:45.972]  They can't attack his policies because his policies are in general pretty good.
[02:28:46.472 --> 02:28:49.373]  And so they attack people like you, they attack people like me, Tim Pool.
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:52.483]  Penny Johnson, Matt Christensen.
[02:28:53.084 --> 02:28:54.706]  Who cares if tenant media got that money?
[02:28:54.746 --> 02:28:58.171]  If you don't have evidence where they said, hey, Russia said that.
[02:28:59.158 --> 02:28:59.518]  We're good to go.
[02:29:21.334 --> 02:29:21.794]  Exactly.
[02:29:21.854 --> 02:29:25.076]  There's a lot of money from China going to other organizations.
[02:29:26.277 --> 02:29:29.439]  The DOJ's aren't doing press releases on that.
[02:29:30.079 --> 02:29:38.645]  So I think if Israel is paying $10 million to a content creator to spread pro-Israel propaganda, it's just as bad as if Russia does it.
[02:29:39.505 --> 02:29:40.846]  It's still propaganda.
[02:29:41.306 --> 02:29:46.770]  It's just as bad as if China does it.
[02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:50.152]  That's why I'm telling Alex, too, and I know your viewers are smart.
[02:29:51.345 --> 02:29:52.046]  Be careful.
[02:29:52.966 --> 02:29:53.527]  There will be.
[02:29:53.547 --> 02:29:54.768]  I think it was a honeypot.
[02:29:56.409 --> 02:29:57.110]  I still believe.
[02:29:57.130 --> 02:29:57.790]  I have no evidence.
[02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.671]  I have no evidence.
[02:29:58.691 --> 02:30:02.734]  Listen, listen, I had the FBI and CIA and Robert Martin saw it.
[02:30:02.754 --> 02:30:03.174]  He's my lawyer.
[02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:03.955]  He confirms it on air.
[02:30:04.515 --> 02:30:10.320]  I'm not releasing the information for some reasons, but they tried to honeypot me with three million from Russia and it wasn't from Russia.
[02:30:11.567 --> 02:30:21.017]  Yeah, I mean, $10 million for the Deep State to discredit the top five conservative content creators on the internet, that's like the deal of a century.
[02:30:22.178 --> 02:30:27.203]  So if you don't think that it's at least possible that, you know...
[02:30:28.084 --> 02:30:34.728]  You also must believe that some 20-year-old kid just walked through Secret Service and got a clear shot on the president.
[02:30:35.049 --> 02:30:38.691]  You must also think that was just the Swiss cheese theory of coincidences.
[02:30:39.952 --> 02:30:40.832]  I don't know what to tell you.
[02:30:40.892 --> 02:30:42.493]  So I'm not saying there's evidence.
[02:30:42.673 --> 02:30:44.875]  I'm saying be careful out there.
[02:30:44.895 --> 02:30:49.498]  A lot of people could, you know, content creators getting offers, big money.
[02:30:50.310 --> 02:30:53.493]  Turns out, maybe it's not funded by who, and then they discredit you.
[02:30:53.554 --> 02:30:55.175]  I think that's what happened to Tenet Media.
[02:30:55.716 --> 02:30:57.197]  I don't think anyone's going to go to jail.
[02:30:57.618 --> 02:31:02.283]  I think the purpose was to discredit them, and they achieved it.
[02:31:02.963 --> 02:31:08.549]  Yeah, and that's why they didn't indict two Russians in Russia, because they'll never show up to act like, oh look, we indicted some people.
[02:31:09.370 --> 02:31:10.772]  They didn't show up the last time.
[02:31:12.765 --> 02:31:14.686]  Wasn't there a time when- Internet Research Group.
[02:31:14.826 --> 02:31:15.407]  Yeah, they didn't.
[02:31:15.787 --> 02:31:16.887]  Yeah, they never showed.
[02:31:17.408 --> 02:31:27.874]  So, like, this is just about discrediting- No, no, that's who the Feds- The Feds posed as Internet Research Group to me, and then we just confirmed it was Feds and had their names and I brought- Oh.
[02:31:28.214 --> 02:31:30.235]  And I brought it to the FBI and said, I know this is you.
[02:31:30.275 --> 02:31:33.637]  They were like- I brought it to another division of the FBI and said, just leave me alone.
[02:31:33.697 --> 02:31:34.618]  I'm not John Gotti.
[02:31:35.018 --> 02:31:36.199]  I don't think I'm getting away with stuff.
[02:31:36.239 --> 02:31:37.639]  I'm not like, hey, you haven't gotten me yet.
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:40.361]  I'm an innocent straight shooter, straight arrow.
[02:31:40.461 --> 02:31:41.362]  You're acting like crooks.
[02:31:41.482 --> 02:31:41.922]  Stop it!
[02:31:42.930 --> 02:31:43.210]  Yeah.
[02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:45.371]  And I've told the FBI out of their face, stop it!
[02:31:48.033 --> 02:31:48.833]  It's outrageous.
[02:31:50.134 --> 02:31:52.955]  And you know, the best part of it is they're using our money to do it.
[02:31:53.576 --> 02:32:01.980]  You know, it was very personal for me when they're, you know, now I have, you know, Tim Pool has to be cooperating with the FBI, all this stuff.
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:04.642]  They get to run all these headlines that he's a Russian asset.
[02:32:05.512 --> 02:32:13.256]  And all that means is, I know what that means, they go, a grand jury's open on you, and then you get a lawyer and they say, hey, show them you haven't done this.
[02:32:13.296 --> 02:32:14.756]  Look, I didn't make a big deal about this on air.
[02:32:14.776 --> 02:32:14.876]  Yeah.
[02:32:15.156 --> 02:32:16.997]  And they didn't do this to me, they did it with other people.
[02:32:17.678 --> 02:32:18.618]  Well, actually, they did it with me.
[02:32:18.638 --> 02:32:19.378]  Yeah, prove you're innocent.
[02:32:19.398 --> 02:32:31.344]  Well, five times they've had grand juries open on all sorts of crazy crap on me, and I never got into it on air, and then I'd have to get a lawyer, and the FBI would say, give us stuff, and we'll present it to the grand jury that you're innocent.
[02:32:31.624 --> 02:32:33.145]  And my lawyers, I got the good ones, they go,
[02:32:34.031 --> 02:32:36.353]  Listen, if you don't show this, they'll get them to indict you.
[02:32:36.533 --> 02:32:41.778]  And I did each time, but one of the times they leaked, Jones is cooperating.
[02:32:42.058 --> 02:32:43.360]  No, I wasn't cooperating.
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.681]  I haven't done jack crap.
[02:32:44.701 --> 02:32:46.443]  I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[02:32:46.843 --> 02:32:53.109]  And then another time, J6, they said, headlines, AP, Jones is cooperating with J6.
[02:32:53.369 --> 02:32:58.253]  No, I simply said to them, ask me not to testify.
[02:32:59.478 --> 02:33:02.439]  And you can give us the third party terms to search my phone.
[02:33:03.039 --> 02:33:04.919]  I did not talk to any of these people you're saying.
[02:33:05.319 --> 02:33:07.060]  I said, if you drop it, I will do that.
[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:08.100]  They said, no, we're not dropping.
[02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:09.721]  And I said, then I'm not giving you that.
[02:33:10.501 --> 02:33:11.601]  And I'm not testifying.
[02:33:11.621 --> 02:33:18.323]  They subpoenaed me and I took the fifth 98 times, not because I'm a crook, but because their frauds was Schiff and Raskin on there.
[02:33:18.343 --> 02:33:22.744]  And I told them that their face in the committee, then they destroyed the tapes of me being interviewed.
[02:33:22.764 --> 02:33:25.064]  And again, I'm trying to write myself into this.
[02:33:25.084 --> 02:33:27.145]  Jeremy, I've experienced every bit of this.
[02:33:28.005 --> 02:33:29.066]  I 100% believe you.
[02:33:29.186 --> 02:33:31.447]  It wasn't cooperating when I testified.
[02:33:31.707 --> 02:33:36.369]  They would have thrown me in prison like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon.
[02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:37.009]  Steve Bannon.
[02:33:37.269 --> 02:33:37.550]  Yeah.
[02:33:37.770 --> 02:33:37.990]  Right.
[02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:40.591]  And the process is the punishment, too.
[02:33:40.971 --> 02:33:42.832]  I mean, that's also a big part of it.
[02:33:43.612 --> 02:33:45.873]  Most people can't afford it.
[02:33:46.594 --> 02:33:49.215]  And so, you know, like, Tenet went bankrupt.
[02:33:50.636 --> 02:33:53.477]  Lauren Chen and her husband, I'm sure, are bankrupt now.
[02:33:54.272 --> 02:33:59.376]  That entire media now becoming, you know, conservative media outlet gone overnight.
[02:33:59.996 --> 02:34:02.038]  They are scared, Alex.
[02:34:02.799 --> 02:34:05.321]  And that's why content creators have to be really, really scared.
[02:34:05.381 --> 02:34:06.722]  I've invited Laura Chen on.
[02:34:07.102 --> 02:34:10.284]  She should be proud of this and go the opposite direction.
[02:34:10.304 --> 02:34:11.605]  I agree.
[02:34:12.226 --> 02:34:13.567]  She should say, I did nothing wrong.
[02:34:14.147 --> 02:34:14.928]  I did nothing wrong.
[02:34:15.068 --> 02:34:16.429]  I took money from an investor.
[02:34:18.311 --> 02:34:19.111]  They deceived me.
[02:34:19.131 --> 02:34:20.072]  I didn't know.
[02:34:20.512 --> 02:34:22.674]  And I never told anyone to report
[02:34:24.628 --> 02:34:27.229]  You know, I never told anyone to push any propaganda.
[02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:28.169]  Nothing.
[02:34:28.189 --> 02:34:33.511]  They got hit by the thing that I figured out instantly and started recording it.
[02:34:33.911 --> 02:34:37.272]  And then went to the FBI within days and said, leave me alone.
[02:34:38.793 --> 02:34:39.713]  And then we tracked it back.
[02:34:39.773 --> 02:34:40.433]  It was them.
[02:34:41.354 --> 02:34:43.454]  And it's just, of course they got set up.
[02:34:44.355 --> 02:34:45.095]  Yeah, of course.
[02:34:46.315 --> 02:34:48.776]  $100,000 per episode is a lot of money to turn down.
[02:34:49.937 --> 02:34:53.538]  You know, and especially when it's coming through your friend, you know, and it's like,
[02:34:54.528 --> 02:35:10.297]  I can tell you wholeheartedly, I say this completely honestly, if Lauren Chen, someone I know, had come to me and said, hey, I've got some crazy billionaire funding this stuff, he's going to pay you $50,000 an episode.
[02:35:10.678 --> 02:35:12.739]  You do it once a week, $200,000 a month.
[02:35:12.779 --> 02:35:14.320]  And they don't give you what to say or anything?
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:15.000]  You take the money?
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:15.240]  Yeah.
[02:35:15.861 --> 02:35:18.062]  I would take the money 100% of the time!
[02:35:18.082 --> 02:35:19.583]  Like, why wouldn't I?
[02:35:20.123 --> 02:35:21.324]  By the way, people don't know this.
[02:35:22.611 --> 02:35:24.172]  That's how most of this stuff works.
[02:35:25.192 --> 02:35:25.952]  Look at who owns.
[02:35:26.012 --> 02:35:27.313]  I'm not going to call it.
[02:35:27.333 --> 02:35:28.213]  I mean, let's be clear.
[02:35:28.453 --> 02:35:31.954]  When you see a basketball star pushing the vaccine, they got 100 G's for one tweet.
[02:35:32.274 --> 02:35:35.376]  When you see that they have a grade, thousands have released it.
[02:35:35.656 --> 02:35:39.117]  People with 100,000 followers are getting three grand to put a tweet out for Pfizer.
[02:35:40.074 --> 02:35:44.135]  Even if you look at these mainstream media outlets, the Young Turks are taking huge money.
[02:35:45.076 --> 02:35:53.778]  Bill Gates admittedly spends over a billion a year just on media, and at the bottom of an ABC article, they're the worst, they'll say the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave sponsorship to this.
[02:35:53.798 --> 02:35:56.619]  They're paying for that Oprah special last night attacking me.
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:57.700]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:35:59.000]  So, yeah.
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:05.162]  So, that's why I'm saying, like, I'm not pro-Russia, I'm not anti-Russia, I'm pro-America, alright?
[02:36:06.035 --> 02:36:20.588]  But I'm telling you, if you don't think that big money is invested in companies like the Daily Wire, or either Blaze, or these left-wing media outlets like the Daily Beast, I've got a bridge to sell you.
[02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:27.715]  So if you're a content creator and you're in the business and they're like, hey, we got some crazy billionaire that's a conservative that just doesn't want to be attached to it,
[02:36:28.587 --> 02:36:30.349]  I'd be like yeah, like every one of the companies.
[02:36:48.209 --> 02:36:50.990]  In 2000, protesters took over an area of Seattle.
[02:36:51.010 --> 02:36:52.430]  They did it for almost six months.
[02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:53.611]  It was called CHOP.
[02:36:53.971 --> 02:36:54.911]  They say it's fake.
[02:36:55.031 --> 02:36:56.312]  Folks on X destroyed them.
[02:36:56.632 --> 02:36:59.933]  Here's the articles from the Guardian, from the Seattle Times.
[02:37:00.373 --> 02:37:05.154]  Seattle protesters take over city blocks to create police-free autonomous zone.
[02:37:05.854 --> 02:37:07.035]  So they're like literally saying...
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:09.381]  The trees aren't green.
[02:37:09.401 --> 02:37:15.947]  I mean, I mean, I mean, like, so they're now saying Trump's lying in the debate about something that's public knowledge.
[02:37:15.967 --> 02:37:16.928]  It was all over the news.
[02:37:17.249 --> 02:37:20.512]  I mean, how would they, what are they thinking when they do this, Jeremy?
[02:37:21.272 --> 02:37:22.934]  Well, they're thinking like megalomaniacs.
[02:37:22.954 --> 02:37:26.277]  They're thinking they have unfettered, uncontrolled access, but people are waking up.
[02:37:27.218 --> 02:37:32.143]  I think, you know, you can only say San Francisco's all right and then see a million videos.
[02:37:33.274 --> 02:37:43.465]  You can only say Seattle's doing great, or Philadelphia, and see literal zombies with the flesh rotting off of their body from tranq addiction.
[02:37:44.225 --> 02:37:46.668]  So many times you can only see so many independent reporters.
[02:37:46.688 --> 02:37:47.489]  By the way, is that what that is?
[02:37:47.509 --> 02:37:50.091]  Because I was about four years ago, three years ago, in
[02:37:53.008 --> 02:37:55.889]  In Skid Row, which goes on for miles in California.
[02:37:55.909 --> 02:37:58.210]  Except for when they have an awards ceremony.
[02:37:58.590 --> 02:38:01.371]  I saw people come out with the skin rotting off their bodies.
[02:38:01.411 --> 02:38:03.112]  They looked like zombies.
[02:38:04.272 --> 02:38:05.573]  It's called xylene.
[02:38:06.013 --> 02:38:06.853]  It's known as Trank.
[02:38:07.513 --> 02:38:11.775]  They combine it with fentanyl or other opioids called Trank dope.
[02:38:12.115 --> 02:38:14.896]  And what happens is their body, it's super addictive.
[02:38:15.882 --> 02:38:19.625]  Their body, their flesh, they look like this.
[02:38:20.126 --> 02:38:22.948]  And then they look like candle wax dripping off their bodies.
[02:38:23.648 --> 02:38:23.949]  Yes.
[02:38:24.049 --> 02:38:27.051]  And their flesh rots from their bones.
[02:38:27.472 --> 02:38:30.474]  It is the most disgusting thing.
[02:38:30.514 --> 02:38:31.915]  And then you're seeing the xylene.
[02:38:32.296 --> 02:38:41.023]  That's the drowsiness where people are standing and then just like kind of passed out or, you know, they're like literally passed out on their feet.
[02:38:43.273 --> 02:38:51.379]  You go to Philadelphia, I mean, look at this, this isn't one or two people, this is 500 or 1,000 people on this one street.
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:59.906]  You have people in Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, all these major Democrat strongholds.
[02:39:00.766 --> 02:39:01.507]  They're killing us.
[02:39:02.388 --> 02:39:06.751]  China is controlling our population by pumping in fentanyl over the border.
[02:39:07.612 --> 02:39:10.514]  The amount of fentanyl it takes to kill you, there's a great video and I know there's
[02:39:11.297 --> 02:39:16.521]  I'd be impressed if you have time to pull up, but it's a cop that's showing a vials, various vials.
[02:39:16.581 --> 02:39:20.685]  And it's like, this is how much coke it would take to kill you.
[02:39:21.205 --> 02:39:22.906]  This is how much opioids it would take to kill you.
[02:39:23.267 --> 02:39:25.569]  This is how much, you know, and it's going down, going down, going down.
[02:39:26.409 --> 02:39:30.072]  He gets the fentanyl and you can barely see it.
[02:39:30.673 --> 02:39:32.474]  And he's like, this is enough to kill both of us.
[02:39:33.235 --> 02:39:35.737]  I mean, this stuff is coming from China.
[02:39:36.257 --> 02:39:37.578]  It's coming over the southern border.
[02:39:38.239 --> 02:39:40.521]  It costs a dollar or two.
[02:39:41.553 --> 02:39:48.236]  So anybody can get it, it's not difficult to obtain, and it is killing our society.
[02:39:49.457 --> 02:39:53.939]  It's just like the British use opium to take control of China, they're using it to take control of us.
[02:39:54.459 --> 02:39:57.021]  Brother, I appreciate you spending so much time with us.
[02:39:57.641 --> 02:40:07.386]  I've got so much breaking news we haven't gotten to that I'll get to after you leave with Jack Posobie, but in a minute or two, 52 days out, gut level, I mean, I agree with you, they're going to try to kill Trump, that's not even a gut level, that's no brainer.
[02:40:07.426 --> 02:40:10.027]  What else do you see and what are you predicting?
[02:40:11.482 --> 02:40:12.203]  Trump landslide.
[02:40:13.023 --> 02:40:14.725]  I think I'm predicting Trump in a landslide.
[02:40:14.745 --> 02:40:16.206]  I'm going to white pill everybody right now.
[02:40:18.027 --> 02:40:19.328]  I don't care what it says on TV.
[02:40:19.949 --> 02:40:21.250]  I don't care what it says on Twitter.
[02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:25.573]  I don't care what it says on YouTube or Rumble.
[02:40:26.694 --> 02:40:35.161]  When people go to that voting booth, they're going to think about how their life has been over the past four years and for the vast majority of people.
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:36.860]  Rent is up.
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:37.840]  Food is up.
[02:40:38.421 --> 02:40:39.021]  Gas is up.
[02:40:39.441 --> 02:40:40.021]  Heat is up.
[02:40:40.501 --> 02:40:41.702]  They're working extra jobs.
[02:40:42.182 --> 02:40:47.763]  Life has been a struggle for the overwhelming majority of people.
[02:40:47.783 --> 02:40:51.305]  I don't care that Kamala Harris is running on joy.
[02:40:52.025 --> 02:40:55.086]  Joy is non-existent in the working class.
[02:40:55.706 --> 02:41:01.788]  When they go into that voting booth, they are going to vote for Donald Trump, and they are not going to vote for Kamala Harris.
[02:41:02.408 --> 02:41:03.388]  They are not excited.
[02:41:03.568 --> 02:41:05.849]  Nobody is actually excited for Kamala Harris.
[02:41:06.565 --> 02:41:08.246]  Most people know she was in the office.
[02:41:09.166 --> 02:41:27.951]  I think if Trump sticks to the message, if his base mobilizes and don't get blackpailed, that's why I started that tailgates for Trump website, so that people can get on the ground and like, I got all these stickers, stick them around everywhere, have parties, make it fun.
[02:41:28.766 --> 02:41:30.007]  Register to the Friends to Vote.
[02:41:30.147 --> 02:41:32.209]  Don't get blackpailed, Trump supporters.
[02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:34.632]  Your vote will still count.
[02:41:35.092 --> 02:41:43.060]  Vote early, in person, track your vote, then spend the next two weeks finding another reluctant Trump voter.
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:44.081]  You can do that.
[02:41:44.628 --> 02:41:45.289]  Go out to dinner.
[02:41:45.789 --> 02:41:46.430]  Talk about it.
[02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:50.253]  Take them to their freaking place and drop them off so they can go vote.
[02:41:50.693 --> 02:41:52.615]  This is what the Democrats are doing.
[02:41:53.136 --> 02:41:53.716]  They're going door to door.
[02:41:53.736 --> 02:41:57.219]  And that's why they tried to kill Trump, because they know he's got the numbers to win, even with the fraud.
[02:41:57.239 --> 02:41:58.720]  If we push hard, you're right.
[02:41:58.961 --> 02:42:01.203]  JeremyTheQuartering.com, thank you so much for the time.
[02:42:01.663 --> 02:42:02.384]  I agree with you.
[02:42:02.584 --> 02:42:03.645]  The globalists are desperate.
[02:42:03.685 --> 02:42:05.166]  People weren't awake even 10 years ago.
[02:42:05.546 --> 02:42:06.868]  They're hyper-awake now everywhere.
[02:42:06.888 --> 02:42:08.609]  I used to get hate everywhere, now I get nothing but love.
[02:42:08.949 --> 02:42:09.850]  Jeremy, thank you so much.
[02:42:09.890 --> 02:42:10.391]  Talk to you soon.

[02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:50.891]  All at thealexjonestore.com.
[02:44:51.191 --> 02:44:52.852]  Thealexjonestore.com.
[02:44:52.872 --> 02:44:53.392]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:54.150 --> 02:45:01.654]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[02:45:02.274 --> 02:45:04.535]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[02:45:05.176 --> 02:45:11.699]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[02:45:11.719 --> 02:45:15.261]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[02:45:15.741 --> 02:45:21.905]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[02:45:22.805 --> 02:45:31.490]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[02:45:31.690 --> 02:45:40.775]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[02:45:41.155 --> 02:45:42.336]  These are very, very popular.
[02:45:42.416 --> 02:45:43.396]  And I went looking up online.
[02:45:43.796 --> 02:45:44.717]  It is very, very popular.
[02:45:45.317 --> 02:45:46.238]  It's not an investment.
[02:45:46.438 --> 02:45:47.059]  It's a collectible.
[02:45:47.239 --> 02:45:54.164]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:45:54.605 --> 02:45:55.666]  Best group out there.
[02:45:55.966 --> 02:45:56.726]  Highest ratings.
[02:45:57.267 --> 02:45:58.148]  Amazing prices.
[02:45:58.188 --> 02:45:58.648]  The best.
[02:45:58.868 --> 02:46:02.951]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[02:46:03.472 --> 02:46:11.198]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here in your store.
[02:46:12.299 --> 02:46:13.120]  And they kicked him back.
[02:46:14.261 --> 02:46:17.983]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[02:46:18.283 --> 02:46:29.350]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[02:46:29.950 --> 02:46:38.338]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[02:46:38.838 --> 02:46:49.067]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[02:46:49.468 --> 02:46:50.969]  They're amazing cards.
[02:46:51.329 --> 02:46:53.131]  It's got original art I came up with.
[02:46:53.231 --> 02:46:53.832]  It's got the little
[02:46:54.432 --> 02:46:58.754]  Bar of gold in there, and it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[02:46:59.074 --> 02:47:10.999]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[02:47:11.359 --> 02:47:12.660]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.222]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[02:47:16.782 --> 02:47:19.764]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[02:47:20.144 --> 02:47:24.987]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:27.469]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[02:47:28.270 --> 02:47:34.253]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[02:47:34.273 --> 02:47:34.874]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:47:35.434 --> 02:47:37.616]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[02:47:37.636 --> 02:47:38.336]  That's not what this is.
[02:47:38.396 --> 02:47:39.477]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[02:47:40.077 --> 02:47:53.189]  This is like, on NPR, that still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the new world order.
[02:47:53.470 --> 02:47:54.391]  I know you don't want to do that.
[02:47:55.111 --> 02:47:59.936]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[02:48:02.534 --> 02:48:05.477]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[02:48:05.517 --> 02:48:08.640]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.

[02:48:25.413 --> 02:48:35.716]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.

[02:48:54.178 --> 02:48:56.419]  We are now into our number four.
[02:48:56.479 --> 02:49:00.301]  Jack Posobiec just got done doing multiple interviews and three shows.
[02:49:00.341 --> 02:49:06.485]  He's taking a luscious six-minute breather until we join stages of six after, and then he will be joining us.
[02:49:07.383 --> 02:49:11.945]  To talk about, oh my gosh, the deep state is pulling its hair out, horrified.
[02:49:12.405 --> 02:49:15.226]  Senators saying, oh my gosh, you know, there was a stand down.
[02:49:15.466 --> 02:49:16.907]  They've lied to Congress, the DHS.
[02:49:17.107 --> 02:49:19.708]  They're trying to cover up for the Justice Department.
[02:49:19.728 --> 02:49:20.728]  They're just as involved or more.
[02:49:21.328 --> 02:49:22.148]  What does that really mean?
[02:49:22.188 --> 02:49:23.749]  He's got major investigations going.
[02:49:23.809 --> 02:49:25.570]  I've got a bunch of other contacts doing similar things.
[02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:26.290]  They're working together.
[02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:27.470]  This is huge.
[02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:31.112]  It rattles them to their core, gets them off balance to not try to kill Trump again.
[02:49:32.256 --> 02:49:33.016]  We're doing something.
[02:49:33.957 --> 02:49:40.498]  And then we'll get into the World War III developments with him, and Ukraine, and the announcements they're going to start heavy bombardments.
[02:49:40.879 --> 02:49:41.699]  Are they considering it?
[02:49:41.719 --> 02:49:47.440]  They say they probably are, with US and British-made NATO weapons, which Putin says is an act of war.
[02:49:48.061 --> 02:49:48.901]  It's all coming up.
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:58.083]  In the first 45 minutes of this hour, then Jack's got to go and so do I to a meeting that's about 15 minutes away.
[02:49:58.103 --> 02:50:02.404]  So I'm going to run out of here and go to that meeting at 3 and come back and work some more after that at about 4.30.
[02:50:02.444 --> 02:50:08.286]  So we're going to air first look because the interview doesn't drop for everybody until tomorrow on Saturday.
[02:50:08.806 --> 02:50:11.207]  Glenn Beck did an hour and a half interview with me yesterday in Dallas.
[02:50:11.227 --> 02:50:11.867]  It was powerful.
[02:50:12.107 --> 02:50:12.967]  I thought it was informative.
[02:50:12.987 --> 02:50:13.868]  We covered the waterfront.
[02:50:14.653 --> 02:50:20.778]  We have a 14-minute compilation we're going to play for the last 14 minutes of this hour after Jack Posobiec.
[02:50:21.499 --> 02:50:22.620]  So a first look on that.
[02:50:23.541 --> 02:50:24.862]  They're really scared of this broadcast.
[02:50:24.902 --> 02:50:26.143]  I got attacked that I know of.
[02:50:26.163 --> 02:50:30.147]  By Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates on ABC News last night.
[02:50:30.167 --> 02:50:31.047]  We already played some of that.
[02:50:32.008 --> 02:50:34.631]  And on Xtra and on one other big channel.
[02:50:35.999 --> 02:50:36.540]  I love that.
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:38.321]  That means they're really scared.
[02:50:38.361 --> 02:50:42.124]  I've got Reuters, AP, Bloomberg, all calling me with the same story.
[02:50:42.144 --> 02:50:43.385]  We hear you're causing violence.
[02:50:43.405 --> 02:50:44.706]  We hear your supporters are violent.
[02:50:44.746 --> 02:50:45.667]  Want to give us a comment?
[02:50:46.888 --> 02:50:49.670]  I'm not even going to tell them piss up a rope or go fly a kite or jump in the lake.
[02:50:49.690 --> 02:50:50.871]  I'm not even responding to it.
[02:50:51.491 --> 02:50:52.372]  I'm over the target.
[02:50:52.452 --> 02:50:53.473]  That's why I'm getting flack.
[02:50:53.773 --> 02:50:58.237]  But I'm going to say this because I've plugged for about three minutes the last three hours today.
[02:51:00.279 --> 02:51:00.379]  And
[02:51:01.653 --> 02:51:03.554]  You listen to regular talk radio, they plug every segment.
[02:51:04.015 --> 02:51:05.956]  Just to state, you know, this economy we're in.
[02:51:05.976 --> 02:51:06.516]  I understand that.
[02:51:07.797 --> 02:51:09.919]  I'm gonna say it again, and I want this to sink in.
[02:51:10.679 --> 02:51:11.960]  This show is over the target.
[02:51:13.321 --> 02:51:16.664]  We're up there with the three or four most informative groups out there.
[02:51:17.224 --> 02:51:21.367]  I mean, quite frankly, we've been doing it longer than anybody, but I'm not in a competition.
[02:51:21.387 --> 02:51:22.948]  The point is, we have worth.
[02:51:23.068 --> 02:51:23.628]  You have worth.
[02:51:23.648 --> 02:51:24.349]  The guests have worth.
[02:51:24.369 --> 02:51:25.610]  This family, this organization.
[02:51:27.130 --> 02:51:33.812]  And when I tell you that I need support now more than in my 30 years, they've driven me to the wall.
[02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:35.413]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:51:35.433 --> 02:51:45.496]  InfoWars will know by the 24th of October when it goes up for sale, whether we have buyers, whether they're going to outbid us and shut it down.
[02:51:46.721 --> 02:51:53.384]  That means we've got to be working with outside groups that are ready to set up new systems and do this and get the crew in there.
[02:51:53.504 --> 02:51:55.525]  Because I can't own stuff with these giant judges going forward.
[02:51:55.545 --> 02:51:55.945]  That's fine.
[02:51:55.965 --> 02:51:57.726]  I'll work with somebody else as long as they control my speech.
[02:51:58.566 --> 02:52:00.007]  We have a lot of folks quartering us.
[02:52:00.067 --> 02:52:02.808]  A lot of people want me to go here or there.
[02:52:02.989 --> 02:52:03.789]  I want to try to stay here.
[02:52:03.809 --> 02:52:04.589]  It's where my family is.
[02:52:04.969 --> 02:52:05.630]  I want to keep the crew.
[02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:10.132]  So I need sponsors that are already fired up and doing well that are going to back us.
[02:52:11.186 --> 02:52:12.046]  Well, my dad's great.
[02:52:12.126 --> 02:52:13.707]  That's drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:52:14.047 --> 02:52:14.487]  Go there.
[02:52:14.607 --> 02:52:15.027]  Spend money.
[02:52:15.047 --> 02:52:15.687]  They're great products.
[02:52:15.748 --> 02:52:16.728]  I need you to go there.
[02:52:16.908 --> 02:52:17.888]  This is an action item.
[02:52:18.468 --> 02:52:19.549]  This isn't like entertainment.
[02:52:19.569 --> 02:52:20.469]  This isn't a video game.
[02:52:20.489 --> 02:52:21.289]  I know most of you know that.
[02:52:21.529 --> 02:52:22.910]  But this is, we're really doing this.
[02:52:22.970 --> 02:52:24.510]  Like, this is really War with the New World Order.
[02:52:24.891 --> 02:52:26.511]  This isn't all the other BS.
[02:52:27.271 --> 02:52:28.712]  I need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:52:29.687 --> 02:52:30.608]  That's separate from the fours.
[02:52:31.088 --> 02:52:33.109]  I need you to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:52:33.249 --> 02:52:33.790]  I don't own that.
[02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:34.450]  That's not mine.
[02:52:34.690 --> 02:52:36.671]  They're top Trump supporter people.
[02:52:37.132 --> 02:52:50.260]  J6 are patriots, badass, Arkansas, Bentonville, knife companies, veterans, factories, fricking, they're, you know, we got badass, super top new breaking supplements coming in the next two weeks there.
[02:52:52.176 --> 02:52:57.518]  We got 30 plus badass amazing t-shirts designs, ball caps, everything at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:52:57.618 --> 02:53:02.200]  And I think InfoWars is going to survive, so it's got to be capitalized and has money as well.
[02:53:02.781 --> 02:53:05.262]  And everything is in stock at InfoWars that we advertise.
[02:53:05.282 --> 02:53:11.284]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and get Nitric Boost and get the CBD oil and get the InfoWars MD products.
[02:53:11.324 --> 02:53:12.465]  Those are the three places to hit.
[02:53:12.765 --> 02:53:13.705]  Go there if you're with us.
[02:53:13.965 --> 02:53:15.566]  Now's the time to get off the bench, folks.
[02:53:15.706 --> 02:53:17.427]  We're going to win this, but you got to get in the game.
[02:53:33.013 --> 02:53:33.773]  InfoWars.
[02:53:34.113 --> 02:53:35.754]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:53:35.774 --> 02:53:43.496]  That chart's a couple of months old and if you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[02:53:50.638 --> 02:53:54.789]  That happened two months ago today in Butler, Pennsylvania and I told you the day it happened.
[02:53:56.172 --> 02:53:57.716]  It's a cover-up, it's a stand-down.
[02:53:59.011 --> 02:54:01.473]  And I told you two days after they're going to blame Iran, and they did.
[02:54:02.034 --> 02:54:03.355]  And now they're saying Iran's going to kill Trump.
[02:54:03.375 --> 02:54:04.836]  They're getting their cover story ready.
[02:54:06.477 --> 02:54:07.078]  It's insane.
[02:54:07.138 --> 02:54:19.789]  Well, Jack Posobiec, former neighbor of intelligence, great journalist, I've been interviewing him for over eight years, and he's one of the hardest working guys out there, so prolific, hosting multiple shows to millions a day, sometimes 10, 20 million a day tune in.
[02:54:20.149 --> 02:54:25.033]  He is really kicking ass, and that's great, because it's more patriots on the front line, and more of us
[02:54:25.774 --> 02:54:27.018]  That have huge audiences.
[02:54:27.419 --> 02:54:28.723]  It's not as lonely as it used to be.
[02:54:28.983 --> 02:54:30.207]  Now we got Elon on our side.
[02:54:30.548 --> 02:54:31.872]  And Trump's hitting on all cylinders.
[02:54:31.952 --> 02:54:32.112]  So...
[02:54:33.387 --> 02:54:36.570]  I was talking to Jack during the break and I said, what do you want to hit first?
[02:54:36.610 --> 02:54:55.948]  The World War III total escalation and the announcements that they're getting set to announce that the White Houses are going to probably make the announcement as early as this weekend to start bombing Russia with high-tech precision munition cruise missiles, where the components are made in America, assembled with the explosives in England, shipped into Poland, and then the attacking starts.
[02:54:56.728 --> 02:54:57.869]  Or do you want to get into the huge
[02:54:58.630 --> 02:55:06.417]  Democrats leaving the sinking ship, Blumenthal, Murray, and others saying, oh my god, they're lying to Congress, DHS, Secret Service, Mayorkas.
[02:55:07.498 --> 02:55:07.898]  It's terrible.
[02:55:07.918 --> 02:55:09.519]  It's going to shock the American people.
[02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:10.700]  Total stand down.
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:11.501]  They're getting ahead of it.
[02:55:11.901 --> 02:55:13.082]  He goes, well, is it the same thing?
[02:55:13.102 --> 02:55:14.544]  And I said, exactly.
[02:55:15.024 --> 02:55:19.968]  The October surprise, total war, the war party, Kamala, all of this.
[02:55:20.349 --> 02:55:20.989]  So we'll give you 35 foot
[02:55:22.635 --> 02:55:28.338]  35,000 foot view first, then we'll drill into it and tie it all together with 52 days out.
[02:55:28.598 --> 02:55:31.759]  You're not going to get better analysis than with myself and Jack Posobiec.
[02:55:31.779 --> 02:55:33.380]  So, Jack, thanks for being here.
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:35.301]  Let's plunge into it right now.
[02:55:35.321 --> 02:55:44.064]  People can find you at Jack Posobiec on X. Also, HumanEvents.com, and you've been co-hosting The War Room while political prisoner and great patriot Steve Bannon is in prison.
[02:55:44.344 --> 02:55:45.485]  So, Jack Posobiec, thank you.
[02:55:46.363 --> 02:55:48.124]  Well, Alex, thank you so much for having me on.
[02:55:48.144 --> 02:55:50.985]  I actually spoke with Steve Bannon earlier this morning.
[02:55:51.045 --> 02:55:57.868]  He's someone we've been talking to, and we do have access through email to be able to get in contact with him, limited access.
[02:55:58.328 --> 02:56:04.251]  And the main thing he's been asking me about is making sure, number one, that people understand the stakes of this election.
[02:56:05.187 --> 02:56:11.532]  How high the stakes go, how dangerous of a situation that we're in, and the fact that people need to be activated.
[02:56:11.792 --> 02:56:13.673]  You always ask me that three times a day.
[02:56:13.833 --> 02:56:15.314]  Are people getting activated?
[02:56:15.694 --> 02:56:16.635]  Who's getting active?
[02:56:16.695 --> 02:56:17.696]  Where are they getting active?
[02:56:17.756 --> 02:56:19.157]  Are they getting active where it matters?
[02:56:19.437 --> 02:56:20.477]  Are they in the swing states?
[02:56:20.517 --> 02:56:21.698]  Can they reach the swing states?
[02:56:22.178 --> 02:56:26.581]  One of the things that we also see here, you asked me this question during the break, right?
[02:56:27.562 --> 02:56:33.466]  World War III, the escalation in Ukraine, the escalation against Russia, the collective West against
[02:56:34.093 --> 02:56:35.034]  We're good.
[02:56:52.305 --> 02:57:06.008]  That is why David Muir, the only time that Donald Trump brought up during the debate that an assassin's bullet nearly blew his head off in front of the global audience, that David Muir cuts him off and says, I'm sorry, sir, we have other things to get to.
[02:57:06.348 --> 02:57:09.169]  No, I think that's one of the most important things to get to.
[02:57:09.249 --> 02:57:17.471]  And by the way, the fact that nine days later, those nine days in July that Joe Biden was pulled out of office
[02:57:18.251 --> 02:57:18.911]  In a palace
[02:57:37.122 --> 02:57:41.284]  Maybe scratching your head wondering, where's the guy who was on stage at the last debate?
[02:57:41.324 --> 02:57:42.604]  How come he's not around anymore?
[02:57:42.664 --> 02:57:44.445]  Why isn't Joe Biden president anymore?
[02:57:44.485 --> 02:57:45.765]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[02:57:45.825 --> 02:57:53.928]  To understand the system under which we live, then you will understand why they pulled Joe Biden.
[02:57:54.248 --> 02:57:55.349]  Because they pulled him
[02:57:56.408 --> 02:58:02.253]  Because the war party had to line up behind Kamala Harris after the shot missed.
[02:58:02.493 --> 02:58:18.485]  They've all lined up behind her now, and it's almost, I was kind of joking on X the other day, as I want to do, that it seems as though the CIA has given her a contractual obligation that she has to bring up John McCain and Dick Cheney in every single speech now.
[02:58:18.525 --> 02:58:25.150]  And she's been doing it multiple times, as if it's some kind of signal to the globalists that you're on your side now.
[02:58:25.230 --> 02:58:26.031]  She's saying you own me.
[02:58:27.128 --> 02:58:32.490]  She's saying, you own me, I'm on your side now, that's the signal to the rest of the globalists, this is my side.
[02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:43.415]  Look, Leon Panetta, I was there at the DNC, you had Panetta up there, you had other military officials up there, you had Tim Walz, this guy, this fake soldier that gets up there and suddenly all these questions are made.
[02:58:44.086 --> 02:58:48.570]  And all these claims, and essentially, Alex, it's also the way she speaks.
[02:58:48.590 --> 02:59:00.440]  If you notice, Kamala Harris, when she ran in 2019, it was the woke agenda, it was BLM, it was we're gonna do equity, we're gonna do all of these things, defund the police.
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:02.041]  That was the Kamala Harris of 2019.
[02:59:03.583 --> 02:59:06.085]  That candidate is completely gone now.
[02:59:06.425 --> 02:59:11.972]  And when they say she's changed her positions, I think she has, but not in the way that she would have us believe.
[02:59:12.332 --> 02:59:16.477]  The way that she's changed is now she is bought and sold by the war party.
[02:59:16.757 --> 02:59:23.165]  And she has been completely replaced with neoconservative, neoliberal Hillary Clinton, Nikki Haley rhetoric.
[02:59:23.425 --> 02:59:29.208]  To say America's role is to stand for democracy and spread democracy around the world.
[02:59:29.268 --> 02:59:30.688]  Really spread democracy around the world?
[02:59:30.708 --> 02:59:31.609]  I've heard that one before.
[02:59:31.949 --> 02:59:37.611]  We have to stand with our allies like Ukraine, which is strange because I didn't remember Ukraine being a member of NATO.
[02:59:37.631 --> 02:59:38.952]  They're actually not a member of NATO.
[02:59:39.252 --> 02:59:57.886]  That's what this entire thing is about and it's the fact that Kamala Harris went there and she admits this, that she went to the Munich conference and then three days later Vladimir Putin got involved because she said, Vladimir Putin invaded because she said at the Munich conference that we will not stop until Ukraine is in NATO.
[02:59:58.227 --> 03:00:06.413]  She's the one who said that and that was the final signal to the Russians that they were not going to listen so NATO is going to move their borders forward.
[03:00:07.384 --> 03:00:07.484]  And
[03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:31.804]  Take all of the social issues and all the nonsense that they wanted to bring into in the debate out of it, all right?
[03:00:31.864 --> 03:00:39.347]  This is an election about what will the status of the United States in the global geopolitical scheme of things be.
[03:00:39.847 --> 03:00:45.010]  Are we going to continue to be controlled by the DC, London, Atlanticist, globalist axis?
[03:00:45.470 --> 03:00:45.690]  Yeah.
[03:01:04.442 --> 03:01:04.763]  Satellites!
[03:01:20.599 --> 03:01:27.444]  And they're going to have those and the Polish controlled government that you and I have been talking about for all year and they're going to say, okay, we won't press the button.
[03:01:27.724 --> 03:01:30.286]  We're just going to get our proxies to press the button.
[03:01:30.306 --> 03:01:31.086]  Therefore, it's not us.
[03:01:31.106 --> 03:01:32.867]  We're just going to, we're going to give you the gun.
[03:01:33.128 --> 03:01:37.891]  We're going to point it in the direction for you, but you pull the trigger and therefore our hands are off of that.
[03:01:38.091 --> 03:01:42.374]  And do we really expect Vladimir Putin and Sergei Lavrov to not understand all of that?
[03:01:42.734 --> 03:01:42.915]  No.
[03:01:43.195 --> 03:01:46.420]  So the idea being is this is the G7 globalist axis.
[03:01:46.720 --> 03:01:53.711]  Are they going to try to force the world to acquiesce, to submit at the point of coercion?
[03:01:54.668 --> 03:02:10.553]  To the G7 and the collective West, or are we going to go down the road of Donald Trump, America first, and say, we need to go back to a system of nation states where nation states can have disagreements, but we can also have relationships and we can have diplomacy.
[03:02:10.793 --> 03:02:16.555]  President Trump was just in Los Angeles a couple of minutes ago talking about he'd love to sit down with Kim Jong-un again.
[03:02:16.575 --> 03:02:17.715]  He said, I want to sit down with him.
[03:02:17.955 --> 03:02:19.315]  I want to talk to him face to face.
[03:02:19.415 --> 03:02:21.456]  I think we can deescalate these things.
[03:02:21.736 --> 03:02:34.207]  But Alex, there are billions and billions of dollars on the line to prevent world leaders from talking to each other, because they exacerbate these conflicts, because this is how these organizations stay in power.
[03:02:34.247 --> 03:02:47.319]  So don't tell me that that's not connected to trying to blame a Trump assassination attempt on Iran, because that's the exact target that you would choose, the same way that they chose Russia with JFK all the way back in Dealey Plaza in 1963.
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:03:06.705]  I totally agree and you really at the geopolitical level and particularly in Eastern Europe know more than I do even on this one of the best analysts we've had on predicting you said about eight months before they install the former deputy head of the EU they would be trying to install him he'd open the borders up to illegals he would turn Poland into an arm camp
[03:03:07.365 --> 03:03:07.846]  I don't know.
[03:03:24.093 --> 03:03:24.373]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:49.335 --> 03:03:53.080]  Then that draws NATO directly in, but NATO's already struck Russia.
[03:03:53.521 --> 03:03:57.907]  For most of the war games I've seen, it'll go right to tactical nuclear weapons very quickly.
[03:03:57.967 --> 03:04:03.935]  And then in most scenarios, within hours or even minutes, we are in total commitment, thermonuclear war.
[03:04:04.575 --> 03:04:08.059]  Even mainline analysts, the Atomic Scientist Association are saying that.
[03:04:08.399 --> 03:04:09.480]  This is pure madness.
[03:04:09.501 --> 03:04:11.102]  There's not even ways for me to describe this.
[03:04:11.703 --> 03:04:16.668]  All the analysts say this is the most dangerous point in the nuclear age we've ever been.
[03:04:16.688 --> 03:04:20.312]  I can't believe we're even on air talking about it, getting this far.
[03:04:20.612 --> 03:04:25.758]  Talk about the current situation with that and why they're quadrupling down with this type of madness.
[03:04:26.294 --> 03:04:29.576]  Look, Alex, and who's going to be at the White House today is Keir Starmer.
[03:04:29.816 --> 03:04:37.100]  So Keir Starmer is going to be, for the current UK Prime Minister of arch-globalist, is going to be sitting down there with Joe Biden, the resident in office.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:38.201]  He's certainly not the president.
[03:04:38.461 --> 03:04:41.143]  And he's going to be going down there solidifying this deal.
[03:04:41.163 --> 03:04:45.005]  Remember, it was the same British that got involved to block the diplomacy all
[03:04:45.625 --> 03:04:47.586]  And what did Zelensky say, by the way?
[03:04:47.626 --> 03:04:53.167]  He was at one of these meetings in the European capital, and he said, well, we have to wait for permission from the British.
[03:04:53.627 --> 03:04:56.508]  Permission from the British to use these strikes.
[03:04:56.548 --> 03:04:58.549]  What do you mean, permission from the British?
[03:04:59.209 --> 03:05:00.189]  Aren't you Ukraine?
[03:05:00.209 --> 03:05:01.850]  I thought the British were saying that you were the one.
[03:05:01.870 --> 03:05:04.490]  And by the way, Putin has said Britain is in charge of this.
[03:05:05.691 --> 03:05:07.311]  Putin said a bunch that Britain's in charge.
[03:05:07.591 --> 03:05:10.332]  Why is there this ancient British-Russian thing going on?
[03:05:11.380 --> 03:05:13.583]  Well, Alex, it goes back to the great game.
[03:05:13.643 --> 03:05:22.054]  It goes back to World War I and this idea that the British and the Russians are competing for primacy over Europe and competing over the continent.
[03:05:22.094 --> 03:05:24.217]  But really, one of the things that you also see...
[03:05:25.231 --> 03:05:35.376]  If he goes back to the original commander of NATO, Lord Ismay, the first NATO commander who was asked at one point, what is the purpose of NATO?
[03:05:35.396 --> 03:05:36.716]  And he said, it's very simple.
[03:05:37.196 --> 03:05:41.298]  The purpose of NATO is control of Europe and control of Europe like this.
[03:05:41.759 --> 03:05:44.860]  Our goal is to keep the Americans in
[03:05:45.512 --> 03:05:48.493]  The Russians out and the Germans down.
[03:05:48.513 --> 03:05:55.855]  And if you look at the moves that NATO has made and you look at the moves that the EU has made since then, it's very clear.
[03:05:55.955 --> 03:06:03.398]  Certainly the destruction of Nord Stream 2 meets every single one of those prerequisites.
[03:06:03.718 --> 03:06:05.178]  Nord Stream 2 hurt the Russians.
[03:06:05.598 --> 03:06:08.319]  It prevented the Russians from having their economic alliance with Germany.
[03:06:08.579 --> 03:06:11.320]  It hurt the German economy by keeping them subservient.
[03:06:11.340 --> 03:06:14.001]  The German economy also is now seeing themselves
[03:06:14.421 --> 03:06:15.081]  We're good to go.
[03:06:37.694 --> 03:06:41.478]  Wouldn't otherwise have any influence over the continent.
[03:06:41.518 --> 03:06:49.586]  And so there's also this long-standing idea in British politics that they will never allow the rise of a strong continental power on Europe.
[03:06:49.646 --> 03:06:56.433]  It's a long-standing adage that a lot of British geopolitical figures have held going back to World War I. Again, like I said, the great game.
[03:06:57.361 --> 03:06:59.242]  And so this has always been their biggest threat.
[03:06:59.262 --> 03:07:01.463]  They view Germany and the rise of Germany as a huge threat.
[03:07:01.624 --> 03:07:06.446]  And they've also viewed the potential rise of Russia as a major threat to them on the continent.
[03:07:06.546 --> 03:07:10.569]  They always want to maintain primacy, and they are able to do so through work.
[03:07:10.609 --> 03:07:19.074]  And this is the Atlanticist Alliance that I was talking about, the London DC Access, because they know they can't without on their own anymore because they lost the empire after World War Two.
[03:07:19.354 --> 03:07:20.034]  So what do they do?
[03:07:20.234 --> 03:07:21.335]  They use the United States.
[03:07:21.375 --> 03:07:24.357]  And in many ways, the United States foreign policy today currently
[03:07:24.777 --> 03:07:27.680]  is reflective of that of the British Empire.
[03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:30.582]  However, you won't hear it described in such terms.
[03:07:30.602 --> 03:07:37.167]  You'll hear it described in such terms as spreading democracy, keeping sea lanes open, maintaining work with our allies.
[03:07:37.427 --> 03:07:51.559]  But if you look at the actual conflagration, the constellation of NATO bases around the world, US bases around the world, and you will see that it actually does, by and large, line up with where the British Empire used to be.
[03:07:51.579 --> 03:07:51.999]  And in fact,
[03:07:52.339 --> 03:08:01.341]  I've even heard it considered that when historians write about this period hundreds of years from now, might actually refer to it as the Anglo-American Empire.
[03:08:01.841 --> 03:08:11.924]  And that's what Putin addresses them in the ancient tongue from the ancient Vikings and then, of course, William the Conqueror that conquered England.
[03:08:12.444 --> 03:08:16.425]  And so they really go back that far between those two warring groups.
[03:08:17.265 --> 03:08:26.111]  Now, expanding and shifting into technicals, why are they now announcing and trying to sell that they're going to go to full war with Russia?
[03:08:26.291 --> 03:08:29.233]  Public World War III, as you can say, is being initiated.
[03:08:30.294 --> 03:08:31.135]  Is that a bluff?
[03:08:31.315 --> 03:08:32.636]  Do you think they'll actually do it?
[03:08:33.476 --> 03:08:34.237]  What is behind that?
[03:08:35.486 --> 03:08:37.067]  Well, I don't think it's a bluff at all, Alex.
[03:08:37.248 --> 03:08:46.056]  And in fact, I think it's actually a warning in many cases to say, we are willing to blow up the world in order to stay in power.
[03:08:46.356 --> 03:08:51.461]  Because they understand if Donald Trump takes office again, and he looks like he's very close to being able to do so.
[03:08:51.841 --> 03:08:54.102]  They understand that they are a cornered regime.
[03:08:54.162 --> 03:08:56.283]  They are a cornered wild animal.
[03:08:56.343 --> 03:09:00.825]  As Steve Bannon likes to say, this is the primal scream of a dying regime.
[03:09:01.185 --> 03:09:03.766]  It is this globalist regime that is dying.
[03:09:03.826 --> 03:09:06.427]  They are withering on the vine right now.
[03:09:06.747 --> 03:09:10.089]  And they are lashing out in every direction because they see
[03:09:10.809 --> 03:09:21.871]  They see Donald Trump and Trump supporters and Russia and Victor Orban and all of these various things as threats to them.
[03:09:22.291 --> 03:09:27.673]  And so because they see them as threats to them, they don't view a foreign threat or a domestic threat as separately.
[03:09:27.993 --> 03:09:31.393]  They view it equally as a threat to their regime.
[03:09:31.433 --> 03:09:34.134]  By the way, that's what they're referring to whenever they say our democracy.
[03:09:34.394 --> 03:09:35.774]  They really mean our regime.
[03:09:35.834 --> 03:09:37.375]  So our democracy is at stake.
[03:09:37.435 --> 03:09:39.055]  That means our regime is at stake.
[03:09:39.515 --> 03:09:40.816]  Our democracy is being threatened.
[03:09:40.836 --> 03:09:42.197]  Our regime is being threatened.
[03:09:42.217 --> 03:09:45.739]  You just replace that with one word and it totally... So what can we do to stop it?
[03:09:46.099 --> 03:09:50.582]  Because, look, obviously Trump threatens their global corrupt empire that's destroying us and everybody else.
[03:09:50.942 --> 03:09:52.383]  They intend to stop him from doing that.
[03:09:52.643 --> 03:09:54.384]  So what can we do in the next 52 days?
[03:09:54.704 --> 03:09:57.285]  Or when he's president-elect, you know they're going to pull out all the stops then.
[03:09:57.305 --> 03:10:00.627]  So we're really dealing with 52 days and 76 days.
[03:10:00.667 --> 03:10:01.548]  We can put that number up.
[03:10:01.848 --> 03:10:03.709]  So we have the exact number, 130-something days.
[03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:08.592]  I mean, this is... You could cut the suspense with a knife and I see even the average conservative or patriot
[03:10:08.872 --> 03:10:10.734]  It's still like, OK, Alex, we're glad you're there.
[03:10:10.774 --> 03:10:11.695]  We're glad Jack's there.
[03:10:11.996 --> 03:10:12.436]  We're glad.
[03:10:12.697 --> 03:10:14.819]  No, I mean, this is the biggest moment in human history.
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:16.281]  Even the globalists admit it.
[03:10:16.862 --> 03:10:18.784]  The whole future is being destined right now.
[03:10:19.064 --> 03:10:21.227]  They're willing to have thermal nuclear war to stay in power.
[03:10:22.478 --> 03:10:34.181]  They absolutely are, and that's why people, by the way, if you've got contacts in the military, if you know anyone who's deployed over there, then please, and you hear about this information, you hear about operations going on, just leak it to us.
[03:10:34.581 --> 03:10:50.366]  Get the information out there, because if we can call the shot, if we can show people that this is what they're willing to do, that they're willing to push for World War III, that they're willing to conduct assassinations, that they're willing to pull security for President Trump at a field in Butler in order to get their way, in order to see this behind.
[03:10:50.746 --> 03:10:53.308]  Then they would certainly be willing to do this.
[03:10:53.348 --> 03:10:57.070]  You have to expose it, and at the same time, you have to hold the line.
[03:10:57.130 --> 03:11:04.675]  Don't get drawn in, don't get sucked into whatever the controversy of the day is, and they're trying to get Donald Trump to say, do you denounce this person?
[03:11:04.695 --> 03:11:05.516]  Do you denounce this person?
[03:11:05.536 --> 03:11:09.959]  They're playing that game again, and he's looking around saying, I'm actually fighting for the American people.
[03:11:10.019 --> 03:11:11.740]  I'm not going to play these little gotcha games.
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:16.643]  This is serious business, and we have serious partners and serious adversaries in the world.
[03:11:16.963 --> 03:11:17.343]  We're good to go.
[03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:41.211]  Alex, you heard that at the debate when President Trump talked about war.
[03:11:41.271 --> 03:11:42.711]  He talked about the human cost.
[03:11:42.972 --> 03:11:46.072]  He talked about the people of Ukraine who have lost their lives.
[03:11:46.353 --> 03:11:49.033]  He talked about the people of Russia who lost their lives.
[03:11:49.153 --> 03:11:50.334]  I love what he said in the debate.
[03:11:50.354 --> 03:11:52.694]  I love what he said.
[03:11:52.854 --> 03:11:55.575]  I mean, in the debate, they said, are you for the Ukraine war?
[03:11:55.595 --> 03:11:56.236]  Are you back Ukraine?
[03:11:56.516 --> 03:11:57.816]  He said, I want the war to stop.
[03:11:57.836 --> 03:11:58.956]  I want the dying to stop.
[03:11:59.176 --> 03:12:00.197]  I want to stop World War III.
[03:12:00.317 --> 03:12:00.857]  Exactly.
[03:12:01.894 --> 03:12:03.695]  Right, he wants to stop World War III.
[03:12:03.896 --> 03:12:06.578]  And you've got another candidate up there, and she'll never admit it, right?
[03:12:06.838 --> 03:12:10.120]  But when you hear a new conservative, they never say they want more war, but what do they say?
[03:12:10.140 --> 03:12:13.023]  They say things like, we have to stand up for our values.
[03:12:13.263 --> 03:12:14.764]  What does that mean, stand up for our values?
[03:12:14.984 --> 03:12:16.645]  We have to stand up for democracy.
[03:12:16.886 --> 03:12:19.748]  We have to enforce our alliances.
[03:12:20.348 --> 03:12:21.449]  And all of this rhetoric.
[03:12:21.709 --> 03:12:26.293]  I mean, Kamala Harris sounded exactly like Nikki Haley up on that stage.
[03:12:26.613 --> 03:12:28.074]  I don't know what else could be done.
[03:12:28.094 --> 03:12:29.175]  And so if you're someone out there,
[03:12:29.963 --> 03:12:37.426]  Who says, Oh, you know, I don't like the tweets of Donald Trump and I don't like his hair and I don't like his skin is too orange for me or something like this.
[03:12:37.506 --> 03:12:37.766]  Okay.
[03:12:37.826 --> 03:12:38.306]  All right, fine.
[03:12:38.446 --> 03:12:40.007]  Do you like nuclear war?
[03:12:40.267 --> 03:12:41.747]  Do you like nuclear annihilation?
[03:12:42.008 --> 03:12:47.009]  Do you like seeing your children's incinerated skeletons in front of you in a nuclear Holocaust?
[03:12:47.029 --> 03:12:48.230]  Well, if you don't like that,
[03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:53.032]  Then maybe you should actually pay attention to the fact that you've got the British meeting in the U.S.
[03:12:53.192 --> 03:12:54.053]  right now in the U.S.
[03:12:54.093 --> 03:13:03.718]  Capitol, you've got long-range weapons that are sitting right there, and you've got the Russian state telling you directly that if these things are done, then we will move to the next phase.
[03:13:03.958 --> 03:13:11.222]  Because Lavrov has said it, Putin has said it, that we do not have any interest in a world without Russia in it.
[03:13:11.622 --> 03:13:14.905]  They will pull that button and there's no question they will do so.
[03:13:15.225 --> 03:13:19.649]  They attempted to show Zelensky this all the way back in February of 22.
[03:13:19.689 --> 03:13:21.551]  They were going to have a peace deal back in March.
[03:13:21.811 --> 03:13:22.452]  But who was it?
[03:13:22.472 --> 03:13:23.132]  It was the West.
[03:13:23.172 --> 03:13:28.677]  It was the British powers who decided to blow up that peace deal and continue on and on and on.
[03:13:28.957 --> 03:13:34.642]  And this is why, by the way, there were secret negotiations going on just a couple of months ago.
[03:13:35.803 --> 03:13:45.270]  Erdogan was talking about this, he's come out and said it, that they were talking about another peace deal that would have been done before the election, prior to the election, before the invasion of Kursk.
[03:13:45.530 --> 03:13:53.856]  And then the invasion of Kursk takes place and the Russians throw their hands up, say, wait a minute, you guys were just using those diplomatic moves to try to put us on a stalling.
[03:13:54.718 --> 03:13:54.898]  I don't
[03:14:09.787 --> 03:14:10.027]  I think?
[03:14:25.769 --> 03:14:26.029]  All right.
[03:14:45.309 --> 03:14:46.830]  I'm on the neocon team now.
[03:14:46.930 --> 03:14:47.990]  This is my team.
[03:14:48.290 --> 03:14:48.990]  Go with me.
[03:14:49.150 --> 03:14:50.391]  We are the party of war.
[03:14:50.691 --> 03:14:52.411]  We want nuclear annihilation.
[03:14:52.671 --> 03:14:56.452]  We are going to hold the world hostage with nuclear weapons pointed at the heads of every capital.
[03:14:56.612 --> 03:14:58.333]  Alex, that's what she stands for.
[03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:05.235]  So if you stand for peace, if you actually want to have peace in our world, and we can talk about everything else after the election,
[03:15:05.515 --> 03:15:09.380]  Then that is why you have to understand the stakes in 2024.
[03:15:09.881 --> 03:15:11.202]  We've got to stop the death cult now.
[03:15:11.222 --> 03:15:12.304]  We're one minute out from break.
[03:15:12.424 --> 03:15:13.986]  You've got to go 10 minutes after the break.
[03:15:14.046 --> 03:15:16.990]  So do I. I want you to come back and shift gears.
[03:15:17.250 --> 03:15:17.951]  You can't give it all away.
[03:15:17.971 --> 03:15:19.633]  I thought there's other sources that are on this as well.
[03:15:19.653 --> 03:15:20.574]  A lot of great people.
[03:15:21.275 --> 03:15:30.798]  On Butler, why is the Democratic Party going, oh my gosh, there's a cover-up, and it's going to shock you, and if there was a stand-down, why are it Blumenthal and Murray?
[03:15:30.818 --> 03:15:33.919]  We know we're up to the highest levels of the Senate of managing these operations.
[03:15:34.399 --> 03:15:38.821]  Why are they now trying to say DHS, which is Mayorkas, away, looks like trying to protect
[03:15:39.501 --> 03:15:40.041]  We're good to go.
[03:16:04.707 --> 03:16:11.289]  We certainly don't claim to be doctors, but InfoWarsMD can prescribe a wide variety of supplement formulas to help you stay healthy in an ever-growing toxic world.

[03:17:21.187 --> 03:17:23.427]  The key intel, the investigators, all of it.
[03:17:23.907 --> 03:17:25.688]  That's what's got the Democrats so scared.
[03:17:26.128 --> 03:17:27.168]  And that's why they're coming out.
[03:17:27.188 --> 03:17:31.109]  I already put the clip earlier, but Senator Blumenthal and others saying it's going to shock you.
[03:17:31.169 --> 03:17:32.609]  A cover-up by the DHS.
[03:17:32.689 --> 03:17:33.329]  A stand-down.
[03:17:33.529 --> 03:17:35.129]  We'll put his book back on screen.
[03:17:35.169 --> 03:17:36.490]  It's coming out soon.
[03:17:36.510 --> 03:17:37.670]  I hope before World War III.
[03:17:37.690 --> 03:17:38.490]  I hope in time.
[03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.710]  Bulletproof.
[03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:42.030]  How a shot meant for Donald Trump took down Biden.
[03:17:42.051 --> 03:17:44.491]  So we've only got six, seven, eight minutes left with you.
[03:17:44.571 --> 03:17:49.492]  Give us the bulletproof briefing and the first look at what you're going to be releasing a lot of in
[03:17:51.405 --> 03:17:56.028]  Reading, Pennsylvania, two Mondays from now on the 23rd with myself and Tucker Carlson.
[03:17:56.768 --> 03:17:59.630]  And then the intel you've got, you can't give it away.
[03:17:59.650 --> 03:18:03.772]  But man, I mean, it's kind of like the Death Stars coming around the planet, clear to fire at the moon.
[03:18:04.433 --> 03:18:06.554]  Just this, you could cut the suspense with a knife here.
[03:18:07.932 --> 03:18:09.853]  Well, Alex, it's incredible.
[03:18:09.913 --> 03:18:21.481]  And yes, of course, we did announce this the other day with Tucker Carlson and all credit to him for putting this together, bringing us home to for myself, bringing you guys home to Reading, Pennsylvania.
[03:18:21.501 --> 03:18:23.423]  I grew up just about 20 minutes from there.
[03:18:24.203 --> 03:18:40.608]  And I really, I really invite everyone to come and join us on September 23rd, that Monday, not just because it's going to be a good time and not just because it's a rally in a swing state prior to the election, but because what we're going to do is we're going to use this rally to present a briefing.
[03:18:40.648 --> 03:18:44.569]  I'm going to be giving a preview of Bulletproof at the meeting there.
[03:18:44.589 --> 03:18:46.710]  And it's going to be a strategy session.
[03:18:46.770 --> 03:18:52.592]  It's going to be an intelligence briefing on the fact is I've got a private investigative unit.
[03:18:52.972 --> 03:19:03.875]  That we've contacted and is working for us currently on the ground in Western Pennsylvania right now that is doing the shoe leather work to find out what really happened on J-13.
[03:19:04.136 --> 03:19:06.496]  We are tracking Thomas Matthew Crooks.
[03:19:06.536 --> 03:19:08.717]  We are tracking his associates.
[03:19:08.737 --> 03:19:09.737]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:19:10.137 --> 03:19:12.618]  We are tracking other potential loose ends.
[03:19:12.918 --> 03:19:18.060]  All of the things that you've mentioned, all of the things that everyone has mentioned about why did this happen?
[03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:27.325]  Why did a member of the SWAT team leave the sniper's nest that was there conducting overwatch site over the AGR building?
[03:19:27.425 --> 03:19:30.987]  Why would you leave the sniper nest right as he comes across the building?
[03:19:31.247 --> 03:19:33.168]  Why did Chris Wray lie about shrapnel?
[03:19:33.488 --> 03:19:40.553]  Why did Chris Wray lie that Thomas Matthew Crooks was crawling up the building when we could see on video that he was jumping from building to building?
[03:19:40.813 --> 03:19:42.855]  Why did they lie about all of these things?
[03:19:43.275 --> 03:19:49.900]  And even why are they not talking about the IEDs that were found in his Hyundai Sonata?
[03:19:50.260 --> 03:20:01.248]  These IEDs that were not constructed alone, that he had help in building and potentially even help, I'll just say, in testing.
[03:20:01.858 --> 03:20:04.900]  And where it was that he did the testing of these.
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:09.942]  Again, this is information that's going to be released in Bulletproof, the book, which people can pick up.
[03:20:10.002 --> 03:20:11.243]  It's going to come out before the election.
[03:20:11.263 --> 03:20:16.486]  It is the first assassination, presidential assassination book of President Trump that has ever come out.
[03:20:16.766 --> 03:20:21.108]  It will also be the only one that's coming out prior to the election.
[03:20:21.168 --> 03:20:24.490]  We include our independent review, our independent investigation.
[03:20:24.570 --> 03:20:26.811]  Again, this is not conducted by me personally.
[03:20:26.911 --> 03:20:28.552]  This was a private investigative.
[03:20:29.072 --> 03:20:29.492]  I don't know.
[03:20:51.821 --> 03:20:52.782]  Blumenthal and Murray.
[03:20:52.902 --> 03:20:53.302]  Blumenthal, yeah.
[03:21:22.193 --> 03:21:25.736]  And so Blumenthal comes out, who is a Democrat, is left of the left.
[03:21:25.976 --> 03:21:29.378]  He is a far-left liberal Democrat, no fan of Donald Trump.
[03:21:29.678 --> 03:21:32.180]  He is close allies with Chuck Schumer.
[03:21:32.220 --> 03:21:35.943]  So I think I would take everything that Blumenthal says with a grain of salt.
[03:21:36.283 --> 03:21:44.989]  If Blumenthal says, oh, it's going to shock you, oh, it's going to be appalling, I would tell you what he's going to put out is more than likely an example of a limited hangout.
[03:21:45.310 --> 03:21:46.511]  What is a limited hangout?
[03:21:46.551 --> 03:21:51.174]  A limited hangout is when an intelligence operation or a national security operation is exposed
[03:21:51.514 --> 03:22:05.347]  And so certain information is then revealed to try to get the person that you are working with to agree with your story, to buy your story essentially, and then move on without asking any other questions.
[03:22:05.687 --> 03:22:17.678]  So what we were able to do in the book, and this is actually kind of interesting, we took what we've identified as 12 independent security failures, 12 independent security failures in federal and state law enforcement, and we put them all into the book,
[03:22:18.575 --> 03:22:18.775]  I don't
[03:22:31.721 --> 03:22:35.884]  Gunmen with malicious intent also arrived that day.
[03:22:36.144 --> 03:22:44.270]  And we went to GPT-4 Omni, which is the latest iteration from OpenAI, and we said, what are the chances that something like this would happen by chance?
[03:22:44.310 --> 03:22:46.332]  What are the odds that something like this would happen just by chance?
[03:22:46.792 --> 03:22:54.058]  The response we got, Alex, GPT-4 Omni, one in one septillion that all of this would happen by chance.
[03:22:54.118 --> 03:22:55.439]  And he said, because of the extreme
[03:22:56.330 --> 03:23:00.740]  Unlikelihood that all of these things could happen randomly at the same time.
[03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:04.570]  It is more than likely it did not happen by chance.
[03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:05.412]  That's not us.
[03:23:05.782 --> 03:23:09.225]  That's GPT-4 Omni returned that response to us.
[03:23:09.265 --> 03:23:10.966]  And we walked through all 12 in the book.
[03:23:10.986 --> 03:23:15.650]  And we also walked through, by the way, people have totally forgotten how the regime tried to censor this story.
[03:23:15.850 --> 03:23:17.371]  They tried to censor the images.
[03:23:17.611 --> 03:23:18.872]  They tried to censor Google.
[03:23:19.113 --> 03:23:21.154]  Wouldn't allow you to search for the story.
[03:23:21.214 --> 03:23:25.478]  If you would search for it, they would pull up, they would say JFK assassination, RFK assassination.
[03:23:25.498 --> 03:23:28.500]  They wouldn't give you the information on the Trump assassination.
[03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:29.661]  So we put all of that into the book.
[03:23:29.701 --> 03:23:32.123]  They wouldn't even show the photo or videos of Trump.
[03:23:33.669 --> 03:23:37.671]  You went to go show the photos, you go in to show the videos, and they would pull up something else.
[03:23:38.051 --> 03:23:49.957]  Even for people who were, let's say, if the algorithm is working the way they claim it does, if you had been searching for it, as many of us were in those first two weeks, or any information possible, then of course that would be in your tailored algorithm.
[03:23:50.197 --> 03:23:50.878]  We're good to go.
[03:24:09.094 --> 03:24:11.515]  And spread on social media to be disseminated.
[03:24:11.855 --> 03:24:17.357]  Elon Musk has stepped out of that on X. Mark Zuckerberg potentially is talking about stepping outside of that.
[03:24:17.397 --> 03:24:19.878]  He says he made a political mistake for 20 years.
[03:24:19.978 --> 03:24:23.100]  Well, Mark, I'll believe it when I see it, all right?
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:25.181]  You know, trust but verify, I suppose.
[03:24:25.461 --> 03:24:30.523]  But look, Facebook censored, Google censored, and we know they censored for a reason, Alex.
[03:24:30.783 --> 03:24:35.985]  They smear what they fear and they censor what they fear because one of the mainstream media's most powerful tools
[03:24:38.687 --> 03:24:55.718]  So to be clear here, we had a major information operation that Google admitted a few weeks ago, they ran for a month and a half, or still are, can't see Trump being shot, can't see pictures.
[03:24:55.738 --> 03:24:59.320]  You search it, you see RFK, JFK, Martin Luther King.
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:05.845]  I mean, that is a major coordinate operation that for eight hours, Forbes, everybody said, oh, he just fell down.
[03:25:06.505 --> 03:25:11.634]  They were getting ready to say I guess he fell down and his head blew up if the bullet would have hit him directly as a direct hit.
[03:25:12.355 --> 03:25:14.859]  And so you have the directed stand down, you have Ronald, uh...
[03:25:16.423 --> 03:25:20.605]  Roe, the head of the Secret Service, who was actually running it, the deputy at the time, lying to Congress.
[03:25:20.665 --> 03:25:25.067]  We have it all, and we have them red-handed, and they are so concerned.
[03:25:25.127 --> 03:25:32.510]  In closing— And Alex, Alex, one piece, one more piece that we do get into the book, let's not forget, too, that they tried to pin this on the Iranians.
[03:25:32.830 --> 03:25:38.793]  They tried to say, oh, this was all Iran-backed, and Iran has a plot, and Iran's going after Trump.
[03:25:39.053 --> 03:25:45.376]  And isn't it convenient that all of a sudden we hear about this Iranian assassination plot, only
[03:25:45.896 --> 03:26:13.266]  Hours after we see an assassin who doesn't appear to be Iranian in any way take a shot at Donald Trump Alex if that bullet had been one inch to the right not only would we have seen a domestic a real domestic crisis But we would have seen potentially the drums of war for Iran And I guarantee you this would be the way to get Trump supporters fully on board with war with Iran You're right the same way that you saw
[03:26:13.746 --> 03:26:16.407]  With Iraq, the same way you saw with Pearl Harbor, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:26:16.447 --> 03:26:23.831]  They use one of these attacks to then go and get support for the war that they already wanted to go for.
[03:26:24.011 --> 03:26:24.532]  Absolutely.
[03:26:25.172 --> 03:26:26.613]  Jack Posobiec, incredible job.
[03:26:26.653 --> 03:26:27.293]  This is live.
[03:26:27.313 --> 03:26:30.055]  We'll archive it all to X, and I know everybody out there will boost it.
[03:26:30.095 --> 03:26:31.355]  This is the most critical intel.
[03:26:31.395 --> 03:26:32.476]  Thank you so much, and Godspeed.
[03:26:32.516 --> 03:26:33.496]  And when does Steve Banning get out?
[03:26:34.237 --> 03:26:34.617]  God bless.
[03:26:34.637 --> 03:26:38.839]  It's currently scheduled for the end of October, but his lawyers are trying to get that shortened.
[03:26:39.319 --> 03:26:39.740]  Can't wait.
[03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:40.300]  Thank you so much.
[03:26:42.031 --> 03:26:43.235]  All right, extremely informative.
[03:26:43.315 --> 03:26:44.398]  Get that out to everybody, folks.
[03:26:44.418 --> 03:26:45.902]  We'll be posting it to X in the next hour.
[03:26:47.009 --> 03:26:48.249]  All right.
[03:26:48.690 --> 03:26:51.470]  I've got a boil down of some of the best questions and moments.
[03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:52.591]  An hour and a half interview with Glenn Beck.
[03:26:52.611 --> 03:26:55.231]  We're going to end the hour with then Owen Schroeder takes over.
[03:26:55.652 --> 03:26:57.152]  Please remember, I can't do this alone.
[03:26:57.452 --> 03:26:58.232]  We need your funding.
[03:26:58.412 --> 03:26:59.093]  We make it easy.

[03:27:06.575 --> 03:27:08.215]  Design stuff for the Trump companies.

[03:28:04.412 --> 03:28:06.693]  This has been controversial, even in my own building, to have him on.
[03:28:06.713 --> 03:28:09.293]  But I believe in free speech, even for people that I disagree with.
[03:28:33.539 --> 03:28:39.603]  If we lose the freedom to speak, there is no freedom.
[03:28:40.523 --> 03:28:48.848]  So, today I welcome to the podcast a man I honestly never thought I would sit down with, Alex Jones.
[03:28:50.589 --> 03:28:57.694]  You are a hard guy to find anybody neutral about you.
[03:28:58.054 --> 03:28:59.075]  There's nobody neutral.
[03:28:59.255 --> 03:29:01.196]  You know, I was talking to my producers and they said,
[03:29:02.239 --> 03:29:10.202]  Every source we find either loves him or absolutely hates him.
[03:29:10.542 --> 03:29:11.543]  Who are you?
[03:29:11.923 --> 03:29:14.084]  People think you're a villain or a hero.
[03:29:15.384 --> 03:29:17.025]  Talk to me about both of those labels.
[03:29:17.405 --> 03:29:17.945]  Who are you?
[03:29:18.966 --> 03:29:21.126]  Have I had to quantify more like a Tasmanian devil?
[03:29:21.506 --> 03:29:27.729]  So did you see yourself more as an art bell or a serious kind of journalist?
[03:29:29.056 --> 03:29:31.757]  I didn't cover the UFO thing very much because I couldn't prove it.
[03:29:32.117 --> 03:29:32.297]  Yeah.
[03:29:32.517 --> 03:29:34.737]  And so I didn't really think of myself as a journalist.
[03:29:35.297 --> 03:29:40.398]  I thought, here's a UN report, because I'd go to the library all the time.
[03:29:40.418 --> 03:29:42.479]  Back then, you couldn't get them online.
[03:29:42.499 --> 03:29:43.399]  I'd go to the UT library.
[03:29:44.519 --> 03:29:46.540]  And the librarians loved it because I wanted stuff that was in the stacks.
[03:29:46.580 --> 03:29:47.400]  I'd say, I hear this is here.
[03:29:47.440 --> 03:29:47.940]  They'd go back.
[03:29:47.960 --> 03:29:48.720]  They'd come back in a week.
[03:29:48.740 --> 03:29:50.761]  They'd give me all this stuff because they loved that.
[03:29:51.661 --> 03:29:52.761]  And I would be on radio.
[03:29:52.781 --> 03:29:56.462]  That's why I started doing a website to make a documentary so I could actually show people.
[03:29:57.142 --> 03:30:03.204]  You know, like, oh, you don't believe there's UN signs at the parks, you don't believe there's a treaty signing it over as collateral, which they now admit.
[03:30:03.864 --> 03:30:08.325]  And a lot of countries sign their national parks over to Pfizer as collateral if the vaccine hurts people.
[03:30:08.385 --> 03:30:10.286]  I mean, Brazil was in a fight over that.
[03:30:10.326 --> 03:30:13.367]  I mean, and I was just exposing all this wild stuff.
[03:30:14.107 --> 03:30:17.028]  And to me, I was reading books written by Henry Kissinger.
[03:30:18.331 --> 03:30:18.691]  Go ahead.
[03:30:32.702 --> 03:30:36.445]  At 2 a.m., the dog's barking and the neighbor's house is on fire.
[03:30:37.186 --> 03:30:38.067]  You're not a firefighter.
[03:30:38.087 --> 03:30:39.268]  You're not an arson specialist.
[03:30:39.288 --> 03:30:42.871]  You call 911 and you go knock on your door to make sure your neighbors are okay.
[03:30:42.951 --> 03:30:44.032]  There's fire shooting out.
[03:30:44.072 --> 03:30:47.495]  I didn't like... So, I was more of an alarmist.
[03:30:47.515 --> 03:30:49.897]  I mean, I would say kind of a Paul Revere type.
[03:30:50.017 --> 03:30:51.719]  And I don't know exactly what's going on here.
[03:30:52.819 --> 03:30:53.559]  But look at this.
[03:31:14.665 --> 03:31:16.246]  What are these people trying to do?
[03:31:16.926 --> 03:31:18.027]  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[03:31:18.647 --> 03:31:19.988]  I remember the New York Times in 2012.
[03:31:20.248 --> 03:31:23.149]  I'm in Chantilly, Virginia, covering Bilderberg.
[03:31:23.169 --> 03:31:24.890]  It's this big conference center.
[03:31:25.070 --> 03:31:26.131]  Golf course shut down.
[03:31:26.271 --> 03:31:27.151]  There's helicopters.
[03:31:27.211 --> 03:31:27.952]  There's Marines.
[03:31:28.472 --> 03:31:29.913]  There's Secret Service everywhere.
[03:31:29.993 --> 03:31:31.773]  Guys talking in their submachine guns.
[03:31:31.994 --> 03:31:32.834]  We have it all on tape.
[03:31:33.334 --> 03:31:33.995]  Put films out.
[03:31:34.755 --> 03:31:37.036]  And you were covering it some of the time, and Drudge was, and that was it.
[03:31:37.736 --> 03:31:40.478]  And they would have articles saying we were making it up up to that point.
[03:31:41.278 --> 03:31:41.539]  Mm-hmm.
[03:31:57.682 --> 03:32:01.725]  They started then putting the list out of their agenda, and the members, but not the guests.
[03:32:02.406 --> 03:32:05.868]  And so, that's the political arm at the top of the pyramid.
[03:32:05.888 --> 03:32:11.092]  And you have the heads of the CFR, the heads of the Tribal Commission, the head of the EU, the head of the UK.
[03:32:12.053 --> 03:32:15.916]  I was there once, the King of Spain, because I stayed in the building after it was supposedly shut, and they threw me out.
[03:32:15.976 --> 03:32:19.598]  And they go, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, and here comes the King of Spain walking in the front as I'm going out.
[03:32:20.559 --> 03:32:21.761]  I mean, just wild stuff.
[03:32:38.424 --> 03:32:44.531]  The heads of all the other big global management corporate systems, the Trilateral Commission, CFR, they're all there.
[03:32:44.992 --> 03:32:50.778]  And if you look at the 100 members, it's the heads of all the major top 100 corporations, the heads of the boards.
[03:32:51.419 --> 03:32:53.582]  And then you learn most of them are going to Bohemian Grove.
[03:32:54.082 --> 03:32:56.564]  I think we're experiencing a death cult now.
[03:32:57.004 --> 03:33:01.167]  I mean, I think it's Malthusian at its nicest.
[03:33:02.087 --> 03:33:05.269]  It's an absolute death cult that we're dealing with now.
[03:33:05.289 --> 03:33:22.721]  I mean, the love of blood from abortion to gender mutilation to war, it's remarkable how this cult is just all about death.
[03:33:24.657 --> 03:33:36.514]  They believe from their own writings and statements people that I know are into this occult organization but in their public statements that they are the alpha apex predator and that just like if you're in a city
[03:33:38.857 --> 03:33:39.178]  Thank you.
[03:33:54.921 --> 03:33:56.922]  That, as you said, comes out of Malthus.
[03:33:57.622 --> 03:34:02.905]  And Malthus just said, starve the poor, give them diseases, crowd them all together, societal collapse in 100 years.
[03:34:02.945 --> 03:34:03.445]  He was wrong.
[03:34:04.065 --> 03:34:04.426]  You're right.
[03:34:04.466 --> 03:34:08.568]  He was nice compared to them who directly dumb you down and poison you and want to get rid of you.
[03:34:08.608 --> 03:34:13.270]  And when you actually study this deeper, they believe they're doing us a favor.
[03:34:13.930 --> 03:34:21.214]  But when you look at their affect and their own families, their behavior, they're really sinister, greedy, hateful people who pretend like they're filling this
[03:34:22.139 --> 03:34:40.695]  This, this niche, this need of the social Darwinists, the people that don't know what that is, obviously the robber barons in the 1880s, 90s and, you know, into the trust busting, had articles written and books written about, hey, it's good that we're enslaving and cheating and forcing other companies to shut down and monopolies, because that's just the way it is.
[03:34:40.775 --> 03:34:41.495]  Might makes right.
[03:34:42.296 --> 03:34:48.101]  And so now they've had to hide it because of, you know, the kind of classical liberalism that was against that.
[03:34:48.521 --> 03:34:54.586]  They then became liberalism so they can wrap themselves in that when they truly are the death cult.
[03:34:54.646 --> 03:35:01.011]  If you had to use anything close to it, it's a high-tech Nazi-type operation wrapped in a liberal package.
[03:35:01.572 --> 03:35:05.635]  After 9-11, that's when people really, I think, start to know your name.
[03:35:05.955 --> 03:35:06.596]  Would you agree with that?
[03:35:06.636 --> 03:35:06.876]  Yes.
[03:35:07.076 --> 03:35:07.236]  Yeah.
[03:35:08.137 --> 03:35:11.560]  And good or ill,
[03:35:12.599 --> 03:35:14.505]  You are the original truther, aren't you?
[03:35:15.869 --> 03:35:16.391]  Yes, I'm...
[03:35:17.372 --> 03:35:21.374]  Look, I'd seen Operation Northwoods that was declassified about two years before 9-11.
[03:35:22.315 --> 03:35:23.355]  ABC News, U.S.
[03:35:23.375 --> 03:35:28.918]  government plan to hijack jets, bomb buildings, mass shootings as a pretext to invade Cuba and war with Soviet Union.
[03:35:28.938 --> 03:35:30.939]  And I knew that Kennedy killed the plan and fired L.L.
[03:35:30.979 --> 03:35:33.181]  Levinster and Curtis LeMay on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[03:35:34.301 --> 03:35:39.104]  And I knew that Operation Ajax, to overthrow Mozadek in 53, had been staged.
[03:35:39.124 --> 03:35:39.924]  That was declassified.
[03:35:39.944 --> 03:35:41.185]  Kermit Roosevelt did that.
[03:35:41.625 --> 03:35:43.946]  I knew that our ships were not attacking the Gulf of Tonkin in 64.
[03:35:45.538 --> 03:35:46.859]  And literally hundreds of other examples.
[03:35:47.459 --> 03:35:57.862]  It's pretty much established that in 1898, William McKinley's Navy and the Sea of Maine and Havana Harbor, to get us into the Spanish-American War, our government blew that up.
[03:35:59.023 --> 03:36:03.104]  That didn't mean I don't think there's radical Islam, and that it's a serious threat, and that it was involved at some levels.
[03:36:05.416 --> 03:36:18.814]  Misrepresented a lot of what I said, but I was saying before they blow up the towers that I thought they were gonna blow them up because the the feds had An interview to mod Salam who was an Egyptian security asset working for the FBI and
[03:36:21.676 --> 03:36:30.619]  The Muslims were going to bomb the World Trade Center the first time, it was in 92, and he recorded the Fed saying, you know, make a real bomb and go ahead and basically let it happen.
[03:36:31.139 --> 03:36:31.899]  So I interviewed him.
[03:36:31.919 --> 03:36:40.622]  So I was already really on this in Oklahoma City, and I interviewed the witnesses and the police, and what really happened, the bombs they found around exploded in the building, and all the eyewitnesses.
[03:36:40.642 --> 03:36:43.923]  So I was already, you know, really dialed up on that.
[03:36:43.963 --> 03:36:45.023]  So the morning it happened,
[03:36:45.834 --> 03:36:47.954]  Back then, stuff wasn't archived on the web.
[03:36:47.974 --> 03:36:49.615]  I was at my home studio.
[03:36:49.675 --> 03:36:55.836]  I had my other small studio, and we had like VHS machines and DVD burners and a DV cam hooked to TV.
[03:36:56.136 --> 03:37:00.456]  We could record TV that way, but I was on the air that day.
[03:37:00.476 --> 03:37:04.117]  I just went on, not just my own show, but did all the other shows on the little network I was on.
[03:37:04.137 --> 03:37:07.618]  From the time it happened, I mean, I ran out the shower.
[03:37:07.638 --> 03:37:13.519]  I said I ate breakfast and took a shower, and then I heard it was happening, ran in, turned it on, started covering it with the TV on.
[03:37:14.099 --> 03:37:14.739]  While it happened,
[03:37:15.928 --> 03:37:19.590]  And then we saw the buildings collapse the way they did.
[03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:20.410]  We saw the reports.
[03:37:21.551 --> 03:37:23.091]  And for me, I said, it looked like bombs.
[03:37:23.371 --> 03:37:24.952]  I said, this could be an inside job.
[03:37:25.432 --> 03:37:27.433]  And then about a mile away, there was a pizza place.
[03:37:27.453 --> 03:37:28.934]  And I've been on air until 4.30.
[03:37:29.014 --> 03:37:32.876]  And I was going to come back on in a few hours on my own nighttime show I did.
[03:37:33.776 --> 03:37:34.416]  So I drive.
[03:37:34.436 --> 03:37:40.059]  And I listen to CBS Radio, back when they had CBS News, live coverage on 590 in Austin.
[03:37:43.143 --> 03:37:47.607]  I pull up, get the pizza out, I'm driving back, they go, all right, building seven, the Solomon Brothers building, could damage other buildings.
[03:37:47.927 --> 03:37:49.969]  They've decided to control demolition, they're gonna bring it down.
[03:37:49.989 --> 03:37:53.151]  If anybody goes and finds the archive, you'll find that, and we have other news saying it.
[03:37:54.052 --> 03:37:56.894]  So I'm going, okay, they're gonna bring it down and build it, that takes time.
[03:37:57.735 --> 03:38:00.457]  So I meet the pizza in the car, listen to this, I gotta get back on air.
[03:38:00.797 --> 03:38:04.921]  So I run in there, and I say, they're saying on CBS, they're getting ready to blow up this building.
[03:38:04.961 --> 03:38:08.243]  So I start taking callers, and they go, yeah, I heard that on NPR just now.
[03:38:09.264 --> 03:38:12.226]  But back then, stuff didn't get archived so you just heard it once.
[03:38:12.406 --> 03:38:12.606]  Right.
[03:38:12.766 --> 03:38:15.408]  And then Building 7, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, falls.
[03:38:15.428 --> 03:38:17.910]  And then you've got BBC, CNN, and a bunch of others.
[03:38:19.090 --> 03:38:23.653]  This footage is all out there for your viewers saying, anybody on X when this clip gets posted, they'll post it all on there.
[03:38:23.673 --> 03:38:24.254]  That's what's great about it.
[03:38:24.274 --> 03:38:24.974]  I don't have to do the work anymore.
[03:38:25.034 --> 03:38:25.855]  I just say, remember this clip?
[03:38:25.915 --> 03:38:26.455]  It's all right there.
[03:38:27.936 --> 03:38:30.478]  And I didn't see this until years later because I wasn't watching all the channels.
[03:38:31.238 --> 03:38:31.918]  Three years after 9-11,
[03:38:33.613 --> 03:38:40.858]  NBC, CNN, BBC, they all decided, I'm not saying they all have the same group, but they get coordinated, archives have gotten cheaper.
[03:38:40.879 --> 03:38:42.940]  They go, we're all going to archive 9-11.
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:45.002]  Well, nobody thought to not have that.
[03:38:45.642 --> 03:38:56.030]  So I hadn't seen the BBC on two channels and Aaron Brown on CNN and all these others going, that building has been destroyed.
[03:38:56.170 --> 03:38:57.431]  It fell in its own footprint.
[03:38:57.751 --> 03:39:00.013]  And they're going, well, it's still there.
[03:39:01.872 --> 03:39:05.935]  I think you are not a thinking human being, especially when you see what happened to Sandy Berger.
[03:39:05.955 --> 03:39:07.175]  There was some connection with our government and 9-11.
[03:39:32.731 --> 03:39:35.052]  Whether they planned it, knew it, I don't know.
[03:39:35.793 --> 03:39:53.722]  But you can't look at what, you know, Sandy Berger goes in and he goes through all the records of past presidents, both Republican and Democrat, takes papers out, destroys them, and then he gets his security clearance taken away for a year.
[03:39:57.149 --> 03:39:58.490]  Somebody was hiding something.
[03:39:58.891 --> 03:40:02.114]  I don't know what it was, but somebody was definitely hiding something.
[03:40:02.394 --> 03:40:06.198]  I see populist, conservative Christians everywhere really unifying now.
[03:40:06.598 --> 03:40:07.299]  We have to.
[03:40:07.559 --> 03:40:08.159]  We have to.
[03:40:09.461 --> 03:40:12.864]  Alex, I'm sure there's tons of stuff that we disagree with, I'm sure.
[03:40:14.585 --> 03:40:15.666]  We agree America's in trouble.
[03:40:16.127 --> 03:40:21.372]  We agree that America's in trouble, and I am a free speech absolutist.
[03:40:22.588 --> 03:40:22.769]  Period.
[03:40:22.789 --> 03:40:23.511]  That's what America is.
[03:40:23.712 --> 03:40:23.912]  Yeah.
[03:40:24.555 --> 03:40:27.083]  If you are an enemy of free speech...
[03:40:28.485 --> 03:40:30.026]  I'm your enemy.
[03:40:30.286 --> 03:40:32.727]  You're going after somebody, and not you.
[03:40:32.907 --> 03:40:41.871]  But, I mean, they've gone after Bill Maher, who I have nothing in common with, back after the World Trade Center went down.
[03:40:42.591 --> 03:40:43.451]  I stood with him.
[03:40:43.531 --> 03:40:43.811]  You did?
[03:40:44.152 --> 03:40:49.854]  Because free speech is the cornerstone of everything.
[03:40:50.214 --> 03:40:54.696]  And I know you know this, but I didn't know this until it happened to me.
[03:40:54.816 --> 03:40:56.216]  When you're young, you know everything.
[03:40:56.236 --> 03:40:57.177]  You get older, you know nothing.
[03:40:58.547 --> 03:41:01.389]  You don't just get silenced when they silence you.
[03:41:01.469 --> 03:41:07.353]  They can then lie about you, misrepresent you, and they build this thing you're not, and you can't respond.
[03:41:07.393 --> 03:41:11.876]  That's why you've got to let really horrible speech go, because the answer, the antidote, is the good speech.
[03:41:11.976 --> 03:41:12.216]  Yes.
[03:41:13.177 --> 03:41:13.637]  Alex Jones.
[03:41:13.677 --> 03:41:14.417]  Clint, thank you so much.
[03:41:14.437 --> 03:41:14.638]  Amazing.
[03:41:14.658 --> 03:41:14.858]  Thank you.
[03:41:14.998 --> 03:41:15.558]  God bless you.
[03:41:15.778 --> 03:41:17.059]  The coolest studios in America.
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:18.840]  By the way, you're an amazing artist.
[03:41:19.401 --> 03:41:20.481]  I'm not kissing your ass, it's the truth.
[03:41:20.982 --> 03:41:21.342]  Thank you.
[03:41:23.146 --> 03:41:26.047]  I was literally digging around for the two or three satellite phones I had.
[03:41:26.107 --> 03:41:27.067]  I'd given one to family.
[03:41:27.507 --> 03:41:29.348]  I was making sure they were charged, getting them ready.
[03:41:29.568 --> 03:41:32.068]  I have an antenna so I can be inside and use it for outside.
[03:41:32.609 --> 03:41:40.691]  I'm literally checking all my gear, getting everything ready, because I've been so offensively fighting the globalists that I basically had all my defensive in disarray.
[03:41:40.731 --> 03:41:47.893]  So for me, Alex Jones, 74 days out from the election, and that's 76 days to hell once he's president-elect.
[03:41:48.593 --> 03:41:54.019]  I'm now spending 10, 15, 20 percent of my time getting ready and that should show people the urgency in my mind.
[03:41:54.079 --> 03:41:56.621]  So the Satellite Phone Company is a great sponsor.
[03:41:56.662 --> 03:41:59.785]  Let's talk about some of the basics of what people need.
[03:42:00.606 --> 03:42:04.049]  There's some amazing new products they've got that you think are awesome.
[03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:08.614]  They've got the best satellite phones at the best prices with the best deals you're going to find.
[03:42:08.634 --> 03:42:09.354]  The good news is
[03:42:09.915 --> 03:42:12.036]  They're not a sponsor a lot of the time because they're sold out.
[03:42:12.196 --> 03:42:13.836]  They supply law enforcement, the military.
[03:42:13.856 --> 03:42:15.837]  I mean, they are the biggest company in the United States.
[03:42:15.857 --> 03:42:17.617]  You get the best deal because they buy the most.
[03:42:18.017 --> 03:42:20.458]  You see them sponsoring, you know, all the other big shows as well.
[03:42:20.758 --> 03:42:22.199]  You need to go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:42:22.219 --> 03:42:23.299]  That way we get some of the support.
[03:42:23.719 --> 03:42:24.760]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:42:24.780 --> 03:42:31.302]  Tell us about solar panels, solar charging systems, sat phones, and this other really cool secure encrypted phone.
[03:42:31.322 --> 03:42:32.342]  Tell us about these products.
[03:42:32.998 --> 03:42:36.441]  Well, the thing about it, you have to just look at what's happening.
[03:42:36.461 --> 03:42:42.306]  When they have 50 plus senators on the left getting sat phones in case there's a crisis, you shouldn't worry about it.
[03:42:42.746 --> 03:42:45.188]  If I'm going to keep people from uprising, I'm going to kill comms.
[03:42:45.248 --> 03:42:45.989]  It's the first thing you do.
[03:42:46.029 --> 03:42:47.190]  That's how you control chaos.
[03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:51.513]  I mean, every one of my family members has the sat phone, right?
[03:42:51.854 --> 03:42:59.220]  I make sure that all the sat phones every quarter, everyone's phone on my team and my family members and then my emergency response vendors.
[03:42:59.820 --> 03:43:03.801]  Every one of their sat phones has the numbers listed in the phone, right?
[03:43:04.361 --> 03:43:06.122]  So, and then we do a drill.
[03:43:06.422 --> 03:43:07.902]  Every quarter we do a drill.
[03:43:07.962 --> 03:43:08.143]  Why?
[03:43:08.183 --> 03:43:11.043]  Because that allows me to remind myself to charge the phone.
[03:43:11.403 --> 03:43:19.066]  But this is part of my emergency response team, the security team, the guys are bringing the food and shelter in, the fuel, the power, everything, right?
[03:43:19.626 --> 03:43:22.627]  The other thing that I do is, I also have sat radios.
[03:43:22.647 --> 03:43:23.067]  So for me,
[03:43:23.827 --> 03:43:30.792]  And my team, especially when we're on the border or areas where it's off-grid, I'm making sure that I have my sat radios, right?
[03:43:32.233 --> 03:43:36.336]  Another great tool that I have is, of course, like, you know, simple, right?
[03:43:36.356 --> 03:43:41.720]  You got your power, your power bank, and then you have your actual charging, your solar charging panels, right?
[03:43:42.001 --> 03:43:47.765]  For areas that you're out in the desert, because what good is it if you have all your battery backups, but they're all dead, you know?
[03:43:50.057 --> 03:43:53.100]  Then I also carry a baby stick, which is an SOS.
[03:43:53.140 --> 03:43:56.323]  You can drop it, send text messages with a backup phone.
[03:43:57.383 --> 03:44:01.827]  That works extremely well just for grid down, quick messaging.
[03:44:02.468 --> 03:44:06.612]  The other part of it, the security part of it, is I put the security team on these garments.
[03:44:06.652 --> 03:44:10.355]  These garments are also really, really good assets to have.
[03:44:11.196 --> 03:44:15.659]  And just for example, with Rescue the Republic, right, that's going to be September 29th in D.C.
[03:44:17.721 --> 03:44:27.927]  You got RJ speaking, you got Tulsi Gabbard speaking, and you have the other big man speaking and a bunch of other people that I, that is all being announced as this stuff comes along.
[03:44:28.507 --> 03:44:34.771]  But all our security, the entire security team is using the Secure Phone.
[03:44:35.691 --> 03:44:42.455]  The Secure Phone is a video phone and it is secure messaging phone to phone.
[03:44:43.957 --> 03:44:46.939]  If it ever were to get hacked, it scrubs all the messages from it.
[03:44:46.979 --> 03:44:48.861]  That phone completely shuts down.
[03:44:48.961 --> 03:44:50.102]  Everything clears off of it.
[03:44:50.742 --> 03:44:51.843]  It's water resistant.
[03:44:53.184 --> 03:44:55.325]  It prevents tracking, right?
[03:44:55.766 --> 03:45:00.529]  And this phone, to me, it's what NATO's using right now.
[03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:02.210]  So the commanders are using it.
[03:45:02.591 --> 03:45:04.272]  It's the very, very top of it.
[03:45:04.372 --> 03:45:08.175]  It's something that I feel is going to be key
[03:45:09.452 --> 03:45:14.657]  Not just in the public sector, but in the private sector when it comes to family members.
[03:45:15.398 --> 03:45:20.543]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
