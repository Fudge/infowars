[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.969]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.689]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.910]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.710]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.670]  It is Friday, October 25th, 2024.
[00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.289]  We are 10 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 14 seconds.
[00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.810]  The most important election, hands down, in world history.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.320]  We are 18 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 1 second until the potential shutdown of InfoWars.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:20.840]  And this is 100%, no doubt about it, no debate, the most important time in my life and my work against the globalists, and it's hands down the most important time in our civilization and the human experience on this planet.
[00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.849]  What's on the table?
[00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.129]  The referendum against World War III, open borders, pedophilia, open Satanism.
[00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.549]  It's just absolutely insane what we are facing and the moment in time that we are in.
[00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.989]  Now, it's official.
[00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.930]  Every major globalist publication from the Washington Post to the New York Times to CNN, MSNBC to Hillary Clinton to Mika Brzezinski, all of them.
[00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.209]  Trump is going to kill you.
[00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.349]  Trump is Hitler.
[00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.329]  Trump going to Madison Square Garden because there was once a Nazi rally there in the 30s means he's Hitler.
[00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:08.270]  Wow.
[00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.069]  Trump is going to be a dictator.
[00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.650]  We're trying to get Trump killed.
[00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.610]  Hillary saying he's Hitler.
[00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.469]  Disgruntled employee Kelly, totally debunked two years ago, the latest retread of it, recycling, fake as well.
[00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.830]  It's total desperation.
[00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:38.210]  And the internal polls, the betting markets, it's all coming out.
[00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.409]  So, they know Trump's winning in a landslide.
[00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.610]  And the Democrat Party leaders have said they're not going to certify Trump win.
[00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.849]  They're going to throw the country into chaos.
[00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.710]  But another way they're doing it is, first it's a few days, then a week, then two weeks, maybe longer.
[00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:12.990]  Now they're saying, oh, we won't know who the winner is in all these battleground states like Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania.
[00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.300]  But now the numbers are coming in.
[00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.539]  Trump in blue states is turning them red like New Hampshire.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.620]  It's happening.
[00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.580]  America is really waking up.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.139]  Trump is crisscrossing the nation.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.319]  It's amazing.
[00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.580]  He's on Joe Rogan now in the afternoon today.
[00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.400]  It wasn't going to be this morning.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.560]  Now it starts about 1 p.m.
[00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.900]  today.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.400]  They're going to tape it.
[00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:38.479]  They don't usually go live.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.020]  They have technical difficulties sometimes.
[00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:41.439]  I get it.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.000]  Live's hard.
[00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.449]  And it should be out by 4 o'clock this afternoon.
[00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.289]  Right down the street from here.
[00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.930]  I have the inside baseball on that.
[00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.189]  Kamala Harris, here's the headline, is Barnstorming Texas.
[00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.969]  Why is Kamala Harris Barnstorming Texas?
[00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.069]  But she's not going on Joe Rogan.
[00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.689]  Yep, she chickened out.
[00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.189]  So they wouldn't say that.
[00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.969]  They continued to change the times and change the days over and over again.
[00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.389]  And then just didn't respond to Rogan.
[00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.949]  I was told, not by Rogan.
[00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:21.149]  Sources.
[00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.829]  So, she totally chickened out.
[00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.350]  Alright, we've got just so much.
[00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.430]  This is so important.
[00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.750]  I can't even have words to describe how obviously insanely critical this is.
[00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.370]  And North Korea has invaded Ukraine.
[00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.829]  Yeah, it's official.
[00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.009]  They've ended their ceasefire with the United States since 1953.
[00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:45.529]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.990]  Stay with us.
[00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.050]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.430]  It is Friday, October 25th, 2024.
[00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.470]  We are 10 days out from the most critical election in world history.
[00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:17.709]  And then there's the 76 days of Trump being president-elect when the Democrat Party leadership had promised because he's Hitler and wants to kill everybody and wants to use the military to kill us.
[00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:23.589]  They've ordered the military to prepare for civil unrest, martial law, and killing American protesters.
[00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.410]  They say they're going to not certify the Trump win.
[00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.889]  They're now going to extend out the election for weeks, throwing it into chaos.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.920]  The Democrat Party is holding America hostage.
[00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:42.500]  There's been a coup.
[00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.939]  Kamala Harris was selected.
[00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.040]  Biden was disappeared for eight days.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.120]  They put out a fake resignation letter without letterhead or without even his real signature, which Pelosi admits is fake, to cover her arse.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.000]  And you've got every channel, every major newspaper.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.240]  I've just got stacks of them right here.
[00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:11.040]  Trump is going to use the military on you.
[00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.759]  Trump is going to kill you.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:24.860]  And then when Trump starts rounding up the MS-13 gangs and others and deporting their criminal asses, the left's going to activate them to rise up.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.019]  Everybody knows it.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.199]  You've seen it.
[00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.920]  And now they pre-programmed for it.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.740]  And you talk about thin, no connection to Hitler.
[00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:42.750]  In the 30s, the American Nazi Party, the Boond, had a rally at Madison Square Garden.
[00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.209]  There's famous black and white footage of it.
[00:06:48.470 --> 00:07:02.910]  And so now because Trump is going to have a rally in New York, something the Clintons have done, the Bushes have done, Obama's done at Madison Square Garden, Well, he's at the same building, so he is Hitler.
[00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.750]  Wow, that's really powerful information.
[00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:18.149]  That's like saying, have you ever walked in a county courthouse for a court hearing on taxes or something, and you walk through the same doors that a child molester has or a murderer?
[00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.269]  You are now the murderer.
[00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.689]  You are now the bank robber.
[00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.189]  You are now the child molester.
[00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.110]  Yeah, there's the Democrats with their 1992, Bill Clinton, Madison Square Garden.
[00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.069]  The Republicans had it in 2004.
[00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:33.149]  I was there covering it.
[00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.430]  Video flashback.
[00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.050]  Oh, my God!
[00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:45.329]  The Nazi American Party had a rally there in 1939.
[00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.769]  Oh, my God!
[00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.529]  This is devastating proof.
[00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:50.810]  Look at that.
[00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.930]  Oh, my gosh!
[00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.540]  Oh my goodness.
[00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:00.720]  Hitler also breathed air.
[00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.300]  You might have breathed some of the recycled molecules of oxygen that he breathed.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]  You're guilty.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.500]  Why some white guy 180 years ago might have owned slaves.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.660]  You're guilty for that.
[00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:20.240]  I mean, this is the most comical, ridiculous.
[00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.879]  It's not even thin.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.079]  It's just, it's crazy.
[00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:30.879]  But it's NPR, AP, Reuters, Nazi, Nazi!
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.340]  He's a Nazi!
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.820]  And it's all about when he goes to Madison Square Garden, oh my God, he's speaking in the same building that Nazis spoke in!
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.659]  How many years ago?
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.740]  Eighty?
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.879]  Four?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.059]  Years ago?
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.240]  Before Donald Trump was even a twinkle in his father's eye?
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.360]  Do I even need to respond to this?
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.379]  He's at that Nazi building.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.720]  There's low-information voters that look up.
[00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.179]  Did you hear?
[00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:08.460]  He was at the Nazi place.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.679]  Yeah, Madison Square Garden.
[00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:15.039]  I guess all the basketball teams that have played there, too, they're with Hitler.
[00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.139]  The hockey teams with Hitler.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.600]  The operas.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.580]  The rock bands.
[00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.210]  Metallica.
[00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.169]  Rolling Stones.
[00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.990]  The Beatles.
[00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.669]  The Who.
[00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:32.809]  Eminem.
[00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.470]  All.
[00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:35.370]  Kettler.
[00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:38.289]  And two men can have a baby.
[00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:41.629]  And you don't have X and Y chromosomes.
[00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.470]  They're just murdering logic in front of your eyes.
[00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.730]  Trying to get Trump killed and saying his supporters by extension are Nazis.
[00:09:51.789 --> 00:09:52.429]  Nazis.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.580]  And then that's all they've got.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.139]  Wow.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.759]  What a situation.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.279]  So, we've got all that going on, and again, Democrats promising to not.
[00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:11.620]  Pelosi, Raskin, all their top strategists, Carvel.
[00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.440]  Oh, we need an armed uprising.
[00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:20.620]  Trump is Hitler, and he's coming to kill the black men, and so we need an armed uprising.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.580]  Carvel, MSNBC, Tuesday.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.820]  And similar statements everywhere.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.500]  Nika Brzezinski, Trump is killing women!
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.120]  He's gotta kill more of us!
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.659]  He's killing us!
[00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:40.679]  Hillary, he's coming with the military to get you.
[00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:43.159]  Biden, he's coming with the military to get you.
[00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:50.899]  Today, the Washington Post, Trump alumni warned he could deploy troops against Americans.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.960]  Now, why are they doing this?
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.500]  They know Trump's going to win.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:07.899]  The landslide's too big to steal, so they're going to hold off with contested elections in the battlegrounds to turn the temperature up.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.820]  They're going to provide violence provocateur or completely staged.
[00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:14.700]  I think J6, 5.0, 10.0.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.220]  They're going to stage attacks against poll workers.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.759]  They're already pre-programming that.
[00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:41.320]  And then if Trump's still able to defeat that, if we're able to defeat that, then once he's president and president-elect, the Democrats have said they're going to have uprisings.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.799]  They're going to burn down half the country and try to terrorize the capitulation of the American people.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.039]  By saying when he gets in, he's going to deport all the precious illegals and all the gangs.
[00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:03.039]  And then the false flags happen, the truck bombs, the mass shootings, blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:19.220]  And then even if he still gets in on January 20th, 2025, they have bills introduced to have the legislative strip the executive of the power over the U.S. military.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:36.240]  Which is a legislative coup of the executive, the end of the republic, and they've got bills introduced, they said they're going to pass, to pack the Supreme Court and create an inspector general who is over the Supreme Court and reports to Congress.
[00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:45.279]  So we have a congressional mob coup taking place over the last vestiges of the old republic.
[00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:55.610]  So they have their coup, major beachhead over the intelligence agencies, the corporate media, big tech, other than X, and rumble and info wars and things.
[00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.070]  We're not big compared to them.
[00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.169]  They don't have all the states or all the legislatures or all the attorney generals.
[00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:20.870]  And now they want to have a big civil unrest, emergency slash martial law, civil war, branded as racial, The evil Nazis against the illegal aliens and the black people.
[00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.029]  And that's how they branded it.
[00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.149]  But the black folks are pissed about all the illegal aliens and so are first generation citizens.
[00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:29.129]  They can see what's happening.
[00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:37.090]  So the common sense of Trump is popular and it's exponentially growing.
[00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:47.320]  But the globalists don't have a choice because they know that they've committed all these crimes and they know there's all these whistleblowers.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.059]  And if we have a fair Justice Department, a lot of them will be indicted.
[00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:58.340]  If we could just send the globalists to another country, have them go like Napoleon, and just go live on an island, I would do that.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.519]  Because cornering them makes them potentially start World War III, which is accelerating right now, as you know.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.200]  I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:19.389]  I would love that.
[00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:23.850]  Because I don't have some vengeance against the globalists.
[00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.470]  I mean, they do deserve to be in president.
[00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:32.289]  A lot of them, like Bill Gates and Fauci, deserve to be swinging from them for rope once they're found guilty and have due process.
[00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:34.149]  But that's not my goal.
[00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.409]  My goal is to get the psychotics out of the driver's seat and stabilize civilization.
[00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.950]  Because, you know, I like civilization, the planet, our ancestors, my life, my children, the future.
[00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.289]  I'm part of a compendium.
[00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.049]  I'm not a nihilist, psychotic, death cult member.
[00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:52.840]  I like America.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.980]  I like the Founding Fathers.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.940]  I like our system.
[00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:56.039]  It's the best there is.
[00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:57.220]  We're making it better all the time.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.120]  We can do unlimited things together.
[00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:07.820]  But there are powerful globalist forces, big banks that basically already own everything, and now they want to own your mind, your body, and everything else.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.379]  That's the last frontier for these totalitarians.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:28.700]  And anybody that studies history and military, I find it fascinating, so I know a lot about it, We're good to go.
[00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:34.259]  We're good to go.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.679]  We're good to go.
[00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:50.009]  And so, Russia has a defense pact with China and North Korea.
[00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:52.990]  China always used North Korea as their trigger.
[00:15:54.070 --> 00:16:00.190]  And if you're told it's 15,000 North Korean troops in the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine, you can bet it's 100,000.
[00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:03.070]  They got a 3 million man standing army, not to mention auxiliary.
[00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.950]  And now the Ukrainian government is saying what I've said was happening a week ago for the reports we have.
[00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.950]  There are tens of thousands of North Koreans in Ukraine right now in combat.
[00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.850]  And the Russians are taking cities and towns every day.
[00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:30.309]  And the North Koreans are what our military was like 50 years ago, 67 years ago, killing robots.
[00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.769]  So the...
[00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:37.610]  We were at war with North Korea until 1953.
[00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.549]  We're still at war.
[00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.250]  It was never gotten rid of.
[00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:41.490]  It was just a ceasefire.
[00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:51.529]  And you talk to anybody that was in the Korean War, my uncle was in it, and he was there when three million Chinese troops overran the Marines.
[00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:01.309]  He was in the Air Force, flying over the Marine bases, dropping ammunition to them in those famous battles.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.819]  They weren't landing.
[00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.759]  The Marines are all up on hills surrounded by millions of Chinese.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.980]  They're barrels melting off.
[00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:18.140]  They're just dropping barrels and artillery shells and ammo to them as fast as they could drop them.
[00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:19.380]  Just plane after plane after plane.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.819]  Planes getting blown up coming in.
[00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.160]  Drop them off sleds with a parachute on the back.
[00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.160]  Planes blowing up all over the place.
[00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:30.200]  And I used to beg them to tell me stories.
[00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:30.839]  I only told me a few.
[00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:40.180]  He said the worst part was the planes they were giving them were so shoddily made because of corruption in the production.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:56.460]  It was bad in World War II, too, but this was only a few years later, in 50 to 53, that more of them were getting killed in the Air Force from the crappy planes than they fixed it later than from the Chinese and North Korean anti-aircraft guns.
[00:17:57.579 --> 00:17:58.019]  But...
[00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:04.029]  Clint Eastwood almost got killed in one of those planes breaking down.
[00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:06.009]  But that's a side issue.
[00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.430]  It's just total insanity.
[00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:24.990]  So, I don't have words to describe the cascading crises all lining up and what this North Korea situation means, but I'm going to get to that in great detail at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:32.450]  But I called this two weeks ago when they said North Korean troops were massing in Western Russia.
[00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:35.009]  I said, now South Korea will get involved.
[00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:39.670]  And sure enough, they said, oh, we're going to start giving munitions to Ukraine.
[00:18:39.849 --> 00:18:44.289]  And now the South Korean government's saying, well, we're looking to send troops.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:50.329]  And then, of course, a week and a half ago, the North Koreans blew up a bunch of their bridges and railway bridges.
[00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:57.809]  And road bridges into South Korea and said, we're preparing for war.
[00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.109]  Well, the war's already begun.
[00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.009]  And that's how these escalations happen.
[00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:23.890]  And we're just right up to no longer a proxy war between NATO and Russia, now it'll be a direct war, and then Russia has defense packs with China and with North Korea and with Iran.
[00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:40.769]  And Israel might be able to handle Iran, but if you study China and Korea and Vietnam and the Asian brain, and Asians are diverse and there's different types,
[00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.450]  but each group kind of has its own qualities.
[00:19:44.609 --> 00:19:51.829]  And once you get to war with the Asians, once you make them get into one, they're not going to give up.
[00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:55.440]  So, they're not pussies.
[00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:56.299]  Let's put it to you that way.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.319]  So, that's where we're at.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.140]  And this is not a good situation.
[00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:07.380]  So, if...
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.539]  And again, I can't stand communist China.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:12.740]  You know, I don't like North Korea.
[00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.460]  You know all that.
[00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:16.940]  My point is, they're not trying to cut our son's penises off.
[00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:21.319]  They're not the ones that have ordered the border to be dissolved.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.720]  They're not the ones shipping in hundreds of thousands of military-aged men.
[00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:25.740]  I mean, they are sending them in.
[00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:35.460]  It's the globalists that are the real enemy, that have hijacked this country, and at the same time are starting fights with everybody else and destroying the dollar.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:52.880]  So if you think lunatics that would ship in, the Border Patrol admits it's much higher, a million probably, 325,000 as of a few months ago, with the numbers growing, was 80-something thousand two years ago, disappeared children and that they purposely cover their tracks, the government does, And facilitates them being brought in.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.859]  They're handed over to NGOs, in many cases, with no paperwork.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.640]  Babies as small as three months old.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.019]  I've had the witnesses testify to Congress in the studio.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:20.000]  If you think people that are child smuggling people and they find them in sex slavery and physical slave labor, if you think people that are Smuggling children to disappear them by the hundreds of thousands won't try to steal an election.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.700]  You're a fool.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920]  And they're doing it.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.240]  The feds are keeping the illegals on the rolls, the phantom voters on the rolls.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.799]  And sure enough, they're saying it's going to take weeks to decide.
[00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:36.259]  And during that period, that's going to cause civil unrest because Trump's Hitler and his supporters are Hitler.
[00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:39.319]  And they're going to kill the brown people and the black people.
[00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:41.500]  Now, what's the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle?
[00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:43.200]  None of that's going on.
[00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:53.720]  They're going to provide the violence against Hispanics, blacks, and others and say Trump supporters did it.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.720]  That is not a prediction.
[00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:58.599]  That is a guarantee.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.779]  They're not on every channel with no proof saying he's Hitler and he's going to kill Hispanics and black people imminently.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.819]  He's going to murder us.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  He's going to kill us.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.579]  Oh my God, get him, get him, get him.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.500]  A, that's trying to get lunatics to kill him.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.440]  Or if the deep state's able to do it, makes it legitimate in some people's eyes.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.700]  But most importantly, they are going to provide the false flags.
[00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:25.299]  And Now it's a crescendo.
[00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:27.019]  He's going to kill the black men.
[00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:28.480]  He's going to kill the Hispanics.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.900]  He's coming with the military.
[00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:31.160]  He's going to kill you.
[00:22:31.339 --> 00:22:32.940]  Alert, alert, alert.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.259]  60 Minutes, ABC News.
[00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:39.960]  Former general under Trump believes he loves Hitler.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.119]  And they predict violence by Trump supporters when the election takes weeks.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.359]  They were saying that three weeks ago on 60 Minutes before they went, oh, actually, yeah, it's going to take a long time.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.799]  Remember, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.599]  It's not going to take a long time.
[00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:05.160]  Hey, you got over 200,000 phantom voters on the Michigan rolls that aren't registered or never been registered.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.819]  No, that's a conspiracy.
[00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.660]  It's actually 500,000 and they stay on.
[00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:12.799]  And it's the same in Georgia, the same in Alabama.
[00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.299]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.500]  And Kamala's barnstorming Texas Because it's very close because of all the fraud and all the illegals voting and all the dead people voting.
[00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:26.660]  And they're intending a sneak attack.
[00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:27.859]  I can see it.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.859]  I can see their activities.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.799]  I can sense it.
[00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:35.759]  Oh, she's here the next two days, but she's not on Rogan tomorrow.
[00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:36.619]  Chickened out.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.680]  Every time they set a time, they change it over and over again and then finally just stop taking the phone calls.
[00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:44.559]  Rogan wanted her on.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.539]  She chickened out, but she didn't want...
[00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:50.650]  Safety chickened out, so they just couldn't get it scheduled.
[00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.269]  Trump was going to be on at 10 a.m.
[00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.269]  this morning, taping out.
[00:23:56.329 --> 00:23:57.269]  I'm told it's 1 p.m.
[00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.289]  just by certain sources.
[00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.490]  So, look for that.
[00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.329]  The globalists are cornered.
[00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:11.829]  They've already instituted attempted theft.
[00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:33.890]  The landslide may be too big to steal, but then they're going to simply sabotage the voting with the Democrat Party operatives in the blue cities in the battleground states, and then gin up a bunch of hatred and anger and fury so that the whole country looks like J6,
[00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:42.400]  and then they kill Trump, outlawed Basically, Trump supporters and wage war against us domestically.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.599]  And that's, they've stated that, you know, we need Homeland Security, there's a new enemy to be the Trump supporters after he's gone.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.079]  We need to wipe them out.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.140]  We need to demolish them.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.119]  We need to burn them down.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:51.880]  These are all quotes.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:59.700]  So, they're really going for total totalitarian, permanent deep state, staged elections, never a free open election again.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.200]  When Trump says that, he's dead on.
[00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:01.680]  It's a fact.
[00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.170]  This country has serious cancer.
[00:25:05.529 --> 00:25:07.009]  It can be cut out.
[00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:09.069]  It is very survivable.
[00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:11.690]  But you have to admit you've got the cancer.
[00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.250]  You've got to have a mass awakening and reject it.
[00:25:14.369 --> 00:25:17.829]  You can feel it in your bones, the self-preservation instinct.
[00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.390]  You can intellectually, politically, culturally see it.
[00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:32.069]  And there are going to be a lot of already angry Americans that are going to go out to rallies and demonstrations, which you have a right to do and you should do.
[00:25:33.589 --> 00:25:40.630]  But when you see the Ray Epps type saying, get violent, know that you're being set up.
[00:25:40.849 --> 00:25:48.329]  And know that this time they're not just going to get the cops to tear gas people because the feds attack the cops.
[00:25:49.670 --> 00:26:05.599]  The globalists are going to open up From a parking garage or something in Maricopa County or in Atlanta, Georgia or someplace where it's being contested, they're going to open up on a crowd of Democrats, kill 50,
[00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:16.160]  60, 100 of them, and they'll have some drugged up autism patsy who's a Trump supporter that will get shot by counter snipers and be found dead.
[00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.380]  Just think about what you saw in Butler 2.0.
[00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.109]  That's the kind of thing they're going to do.
[00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:27.470]  So you will see that on the current trajectory.
[00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.829]  I hope by exposing it, we're able to stop it.
[00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.630]  But they've telegraphed it.
[00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:33.569]  They've scripted it.
[00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:34.890]  They've laid it out.
[00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.250]  And so that's where we are historically.
[00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:38.309]  And it's good to be ahead of it.
[00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.569]  It's good that we know about it.
[00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:42.309]  It's good we're going to have 30, 40 million people watch the show today.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.059]  Hopefully more if you'll just go to Real Alex Jones and share the live link and say, hey, you better tune in here.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.440]  The election thefts some.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.539]  There's a way to stop the enemy.
[00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:51.039]  This guy's got the enemy blueprint.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.700]  He's proven it.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.539]  My God, you don't even need me to tell you this now.
[00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:54.480]  It's all right here in front of you.
[00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:58.099]  We're going to lay it all out in the North Korea situation.

[00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:08.109]  Alright, I mentioned a lot of this news, but I actually want to play the clips and analyze it more and focus on how we stop it.
[00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:18.609]  And then, I want to talk about the next level of the enemy's plans under the social credit score to steal your identities.
[00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:27.930]  I've told you a lot about this on air the last few months, and even other talk show hosts like Joe Rogan was asking about it last week.
[00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.829]  I find it hard to believe, even though they don't know I don't make stuff up, because it's so outrageous.
[00:28:35.009 --> 00:28:36.769]  It's so totally insane.
[00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:49.430]  And there's been some big developments on that front today that just broke minutes ago on Bloomberg that I already knew about because it was in a hearing this morning, but it hadn't hit the news yet.
[00:28:50.069 --> 00:28:55.269]  And this stuff's so insane, if I don't even show it to you in Bloomberg, even the patriots don't believe this stuff.
[00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.349]  Oh, that can't happen in America.
[00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:04.289]  Federal filing to take the name Alex Jones and not let me use my name.
[00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.210]  Not just my social media.
[00:29:14.069 --> 00:29:14.789]  That's coming up.
[00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:18.130]  And also pull up the old articles.
[00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:20.109]  Sandy Hook families want his social media.
[00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.369]  Give me that old article.
[00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:26.529]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.029]  As I told you, Trump was supposed to get here this morning.
[00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:32.589]  Now it is at 12 noon.
[00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.190]  He'll be at Rogan's at 1.
[00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.049]  And that is being reported by KXCN. Just broke there.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.799]  Donald Trump's Austin visit.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.920]  They're going to be shutting the road down right by us.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.160]  We're literally a mile from Rogan.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.359]  What a strange world how everything's converging here.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.680]  I've been right here for 30 plus years.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.380]  All right.
[00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:55.720]  We'll get to that.
[00:29:56.019 --> 00:30:02.160]  But the big news, if you just joined us, a lot of people are joining us.
[00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:04.660]  Hundreds of thousands every 20 minutes are joining.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.900]  Just on the X feed and other feeds we've got.
[00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:11.619]  At Infowars.com forward slash show, band.video.
[00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:14.880]  They try to take those down or take those away, which they're trying to do.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:22.039]  You can follow me at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.400]  AlexJones.network is the URL. Might want to follow that.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.619]  Might want to tell others to follow that.
[00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:28.880]  We're at the heart of the fight.
[00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:30.740]  Center of the war against the globalists.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.519]  So, it's now official.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.500]  The Democrats have said in their policy reports and statements...
[00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:54.859]  That they are going to not certify Trump, hold up the election in the key battleground states and blue cities they control with their election officials, put in by Soros, who get rewarded to be the governors of Arizona after they steal the elections from Carrie Lake and Trump,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.599]  the American people.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.079]  They're just duplicating it everywhere.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:05.880]  Kamala will then sit and decide on the non-certification of Trump as the VP. They've already announced they're planning to do that.
[00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.299]  And you say, well, how will they politically get away with that?
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:18.779]  During the contested election, they now say we'll go on for several weeks after November 5th, in the 76 days of hell, you've heard me harping on.
[00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:25.019]  For years, this was coming, now we're here.
[00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:32.519]  And the political experts on with me, oh, Alex, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.690]  Well, if you're not going to expose the enemy's plan, you're going to lose.
[00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.910]  That's why we're tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:49.069]  You don't think the globalists aren't projecting out the future and planning for the future?
[00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:55.390]  And you go where you want to go and you win in the present by planning and preparing the future.
[00:31:56.109 --> 00:31:59.829]  But we're trained to live in the moment, aren't we?
[00:32:01.089 --> 00:32:02.750]  Well, I certainly enjoy the moment.
[00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:09.920]  But I live by studying the past, The present and then projecting the future.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.759]  That's what I do.
[00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:18.460]  Undoubtedly, hands down, it's just a fact, so people recognize this, we can get out of this.
[00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:21.880]  The best futurist in the world.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.759]  That's really what I am.
[00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.769]  Not the fake pop future they put out.
[00:32:27.829 --> 00:32:29.289]  The real future they want to build.
[00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.369]  And the globalists are almost in total control.
[00:32:31.589 --> 00:32:44.490]  So the dystopia they say they want to build is what we're going to live in if we just sit here and give them all the power and engage in this abdication of our rights.
[00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.450]  I'm not handing my freedom and my destiny and my will over.
[00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.809]  What about you?
[00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:57.130]  So The crescendo has been reached.
[00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:17.970]  The closing days of Kamala's campaign where she was installed in a coup is that Trump is a coup and Trump's going to use the military on you and Trump's going to kill you because you're Hispanic or black and Trump's Hitler and Trump's a Nazi and Trump's going to speak at the place where the Nazi rally was in 1939,
[00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.390]  Madison Square Garden, where everybody else goes.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:29.660]  And he's going to kill you, and he's going to kill us, and he's just a murderer, and he's a rapist, and he's a this, and he's a that, and he's a fraud, and he's a scam, and he's not an American.
[00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:31.859]  Bruce Springsteen, he's not an American.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.319]  He doesn't know what it is to be an American.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:52.849]  This by the party that wants to end the country itself, and is trying to get rid now, and are, statues of George Washington, And Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.210]  It's ridiculous.
[00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:05.089]  Everything they say about Trump is what they themselves are doing.
[00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:11.989]  And so are we just going to sit here and be reactive when they pull all this?
[00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.530]  They're already stealing it.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.179]  With the Google manipulation, with the election meddling, with the censorship, that's where the real still goes on.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:41.679]  Then with all the phantom voters and dead people and illegals that they're ordering to stay on the ballot, the out-of-control feds, and extending it out for weeks and weeks and weeks after the election, and then telling you the script, That Trump supporters aren't going to accept this and they're going to get violent,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.539]  so they will provide the violence to frame us.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.800]  It is not a prediction.
[00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.860]  It is a fact.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:35:02.280]  It's like if you're standing by a river and there's a town a mile away and the river's flowing at six miles an hour, you can calculate what time that water is going to arrive in the town.
[00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:07.659]  It's not a prediction that that water is going to flow downstream to the town.
[00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:13.820]  It's a fact.
[00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.980]  So, they fired the bullet out of the gun.
[00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:20.219]  It's coming towards us of civil unrest.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.559]  They're going to call it a civil war.
[00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:23.780]  They're going to make it race-based.
[00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:40.139]  And to provide the impetus, they will need horrible events killing Hispanics, Blacks, all the groups the Democrats say they want to protect from Trump.
[00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:42.440]  That's it.
[00:35:45.989 --> 00:36:01.989]  Like if you watch mom get out pancake mix and milk and an egg, and you've seen her do it 200 times, you've helped her do it, and you're watching her whip it up and she gets the griddle out and puts butter on it and you go,
[00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.130]  mom, what are you going to make?
[00:36:03.289 --> 00:36:05.369]  She goes, I'm going to make pancakes, sweetheart.
[00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.289]  You know that.
[00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:13.929]  Well, we're in the process now where we watch them get the mix, get the egg, get the...
[00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:15.809]  Stir it up.
[00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:16.489]  The griddle's on.
[00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.510]  And they're already pouring pancakes.
[00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.349]  But they're not pouring pancakes.
[00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:26.449]  They're pouring tyranny and civil war and mass arrest and false flags.
[00:36:29.409 --> 00:36:32.349]  So the pancakes are on the griddle, bubbling and turning brown.
[00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:37.250]  And they're going to start serving it up the next 10 days.
[00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:42.289]  But it's not syrup they've got out.
[00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:47.019]  And the plates and the knives and the forks and the strawberries and the whipped cream.
[00:36:50.739 --> 00:37:06.139]  It's slavery and a permanent bureaucracy dictatorship that's already in control of the government, the media and big tech and most of the churches that wants to finish us off because we've been struggling and we've been fighting back and we're so close to freeing the country from the scum.
[00:37:13.739 --> 00:37:18.440]  We are fighting for our lives.
[00:37:20.139 --> 00:37:22.260]  And that's not an overstatement.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.159]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.639]  You look at history.
[00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:26.679]  Free countries are very rare.
[00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:29.219]  Horrible tyrannies are common.
[00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:33.400]  Really terrible ones are routine.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:40.139]  And it follows the same path, but now with a high-tech overlay to make it even nastier.
[00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:45.590]  And we've got the worst, the worst running our Western countries.
[00:37:48.269 --> 00:37:52.469]  And now they're all stirred up and know they're losing power and know the world's waking up to them.
[00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:57.610]  So they're coming down on us with everything they've got, with both feet.
[00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:04.989]  And the public just, I get it, has grown up in such an open, free society comparatively to other nations.
[00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:07.130]  And people don't have a grasp of history.
[00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:10.250]  When you know history, people think you're some kind of space alien.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.139]  And here we are.
[00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:23.260]  And so I'm very sad about the fact that my predictions are all going to come true.
[00:38:24.019 --> 00:38:26.400]  And people go, my God, how does he know all this?
[00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.000]  How do I know all this?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.579]  It's as plain as the nose on my face.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.599]  And I've been saying it for two and a half years.
[00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:40.980]  I said, if NATO keeps turning up the heat on Russia...
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.860]  We're gonna be fighting Chinese troops.
[00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:49.340]  I didn't even think it'd be North Koreans.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.619]  That's even crazier.
[00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:52.500]  So I missed that one.
[00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:14.860]  And I put out a headline last night, and even though I showed the documents, just type in Korean War, history of Korean War, Encyclopedia Britannica, all of it, 1950 to 1953, police action, Wasn't called a war.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.400]  The war never ended.
[00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:20.920]  There was a ceasefire July 27th, 1953.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.019]  And now Korea has said that that ceasefire is basically over a week and a half ago.
[00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:32.960]  They said, we're now at war, getting ready to go to full war, and blew up their bridges to South Korea.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.199]  Then Xi Jinping, a few days later, said, told his military to prepare for total war.
[00:39:41.699 --> 00:39:46.000]  Putin said, yeah, there's North Korean troops here, and it's none of your business.
[00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:53.239]  So, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.300]  The Russians historically will fight you.
[00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:06.849]  And so if you're looking to go find somebody that'll have a fight with you, if you're looking for somebody to knock back down, you wouldn't find the right people.
[00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.449]  Here, let's go start a fight with Mike Tyson as prime.
[00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.030]  Let's go.
[00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.610]  They have more nuclear weapons than us and are willing to go to war.
[00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:16.510]  Let's go start the fight with the most dangerous people.
[00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.889]  That's a wonderful idea.
[00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:23.690]  And then let's start a fight with the second most dangerous people, the Chinese, with all their nuclear weapons.
[00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:28.230]  Who we've already been at war with in the 1950s.
[00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:31.579]  That's a really wonderful idea.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.860]  And then, hey, the FBI is all public.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.159]  They're all training with the feds to fight Trump supporters, too.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.539]  And they're going to round us up and crush us.
[00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:46.559]  And, man, you're going to be fighting a lot of people.
[00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:49.260]  The Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, the American people.
[00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:52.500]  My God, who else are you going to go start a fight with?
[00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:58.329]  You're going to try to kill Trump, blow his airplane up, or try to shoot him twice?
[00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.110]  People are maniacs.
[00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:13.449]  But they're a bunch of Jamie Raskins who can barely walk, shooting their mouths off about civil war and how they're going to crush us because we put up with it.
[00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.010]  People say, okay, well then should we get violent?
[00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.230]  No, because the public wasn't awake.
[00:41:20.929 --> 00:41:22.590]  And they'll use the media to frame us.
[00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.369]  You have to destroy their system.
[00:41:24.489 --> 00:41:25.449]  You have to discredit them.
[00:41:25.809 --> 00:41:27.250]  You have to take back the government.
[00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:39.230]  You have to use Mahatma Gandhi tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence to try to fix this through the process because we're winning in the process.
[00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.869]  That's why they want to go to violence and go to civil war.
[00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.650]  Because they're losing.
[00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:57.110]  Now, if we're unable to fix this peacefully and they go into the violence and they're trying to round people up and take you to FEMA camps and disappearing people, yeah, okay?
[00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:58.929]  Everybody wants a war.
[00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.110]  The bad guys want one.
[00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:01.130]  The good guys want one.
[00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:04.289]  There's a good chance, everybody, you're going to get your big bloodbath, okay?
[00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:13.090]  All I'm telling everybody is playing soldier isn't a fun thing.
[00:42:15.519 --> 00:42:29.519]  And I've been around enough, and I've studied enough history, and I've been run over enough, and I know how things work, that there are a lot of good people in this country, but there are also a lot of soft people.
[00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:33.280]  And society breaks down, and the power's off for a week.
[00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:35.780]  It's going to look like a zombie apocalypse out there.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:42.239]  And see, that's the globalist ace in the hole, is they just can turn the power off, and people don't even know what's going on.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.219]  And they'll just say Trump did it.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.599]  With the Russians.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.559]  The FBI has already said, oh, Trump's going to cut the power during the election.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.059]  FBI memo last year.
[00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:54.219]  They already pre-programmed it all.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.820]  And I don't know which attack they're going to run.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.500]  Maybe they'll run all the attacks or one of the attacks or three of the attacks.
[00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:02.019]  But they got all these attacks loaded, ready, and then they've now...
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:09.739]  Started initiating them like a catapult when you cut the rope and it goes and fires the projectile over the castle walls.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.219]  They've already cut the rope on the catapult.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.519]  It's already in motion firing at salvo.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.000]  The pancakes are already on the griddle.
[00:43:17.619 --> 00:43:20.019]  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see what's going on here.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.519]  So we're in that moment of history.
[00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.969]  Give more sane people in the power structure.
[00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.769]  Back off of this.
[00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:31.110]  De-escalate.
[00:43:31.429 --> 00:43:32.570]  Let Trump get in.
[00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:34.550]  Let us try to stabilize things.
[00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.449]  Trump's smart.
[00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.650]  He's not going to really go after a bunch of the globalists.
[00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.829]  He's just going to fire them all.
[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:47.989]  And try to steady the ship and get us off this transhumanist death cult angle.
[00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.210]  That's what Musk is doing too.
[00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.750]  And That's not a bed of roses either.
[00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:53.969]  Society's really screwed up.
[00:43:54.289 --> 00:43:55.210]  But it's not.
[00:43:57.869 --> 00:44:11.849]  Power-mad, lunatic maniacs who don't know how to ever back down.
[00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:19.150]  Because they have a normalcy bias that they've been in charge so long, they just think, well, this time, this time we'll succeed.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.559]  No, everybody's turning against you.
[00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:24.659]  The whole world knows what you're doing.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.000]  Anybody that's got a brain cell does.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:42.800]  And so, we have to talk about the fact that the steal is on, and they don't think that's going to work, so they're just going to hold up the election and gin up civil unrest and say it's Trump's fault, which they've already said is going to happen,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:48.139]  and we better start wargaming what we're going to do in 10 days when this goes down.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:48.679]  Or...
[00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.969]  That's their whole movement.
[00:44:50.969 --> 00:44:51.889]  That's their preparation.
[00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:53.989]  That's what they're angling for.
[00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.010]  That's the main attack.
[00:44:56.429 --> 00:45:03.349]  Or they're going to steal Texas because Texas isn't watching closely enough and flip the whole country that way.
[00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.829]  I feel a disturbance in the force on that one.
[00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:14.389]  I think that it's those two scenarios.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.739]  Or things just get out of hand and somebody makes a wrong move.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.739]  Or it looks like a missile launch, but it's not.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.300]  And Russia starts nuking.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.800]  Or NATO starts nuking.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.800]  Or North Korea starts nuking.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.539]  Or China starts nuking.
[00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:34.639]  Or there's an incident in the South China Sea.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.619]  Or China goes into Taiwan.
[00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:39.579]  I mean, it's all on the table.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.860]  And I just want to get the public...
[00:45:46.909 --> 00:46:02.429]  To talk about the big issues going down and so that in the halls of Congress and the think tanks and the corporations too, they can get out of their compartmentalization of whatever scam they're running or whatever globalist operation they're involved in and say,
[00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:08.090]  hey, have you guys looked around you at your owners and bosses running off the middle of nowhere in armored fortresses and not being seen?
[00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:11.710]  That's bad management.
[00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.750]  You know, the people that have the 35,000 foot view are running for the hills.
[00:46:16.329 --> 00:46:18.489]  You guys might want to change your course.
[00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.570]  And Zuckerberg, I told him this month before he did, I said, you need to come out and apologize and disengage right now.
[00:46:24.429 --> 00:46:25.130]  He did it.
[00:46:25.269 --> 00:46:27.969]  I'm not saying I caused that, but that's the obvious next move.
[00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:32.099]  You know, you don't have to be Elon Musk and join the team.
[00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:33.679]  You can just get out of the way.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.539]  How's that sound?
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.579]  And then you can live out the rest of your life with all your stolen money, whatever.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.079]  Just get out of our way.
[00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:43.400]  We don't want to destroy you.
[00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:45.460]  We just want you to get off our backs.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.179]  Okay, just listen.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.280]  We will beat you.
[00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:53.880]  A lot of us won't be here to see it, but if you want the fight and you go all the way through, you can look at all the angles.
[00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:55.579]  You're not going to win.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.099]  And Hitler's generals told him this in 43.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.119]  He didn't listen.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.639]  He should have listened.
[00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:04.239]  He didn't.
[00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:08.539]  I'm telling the globalists, listen to me now.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.199]  You are beaten.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.480]  You can sue for peace.
[00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:14.039]  You can capitulate.
[00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:18.539]  And you can leave with your heads.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.139]  You're repeating history again, this time with nuclear weapons.
[00:47:26.599 --> 00:47:27.400]  Stop it!
[00:47:28.739 --> 00:47:29.559]  Stop it!
[00:47:31.679 --> 00:47:37.000]  Or are you so under Satan's control you don't even have survival instinct?
[00:47:37.159 --> 00:47:38.380]  And that's what it is at the top.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.179]  You guys are getting such a thrill out of this.
[00:47:41.199 --> 00:47:42.340]  You know exactly what you're doing.
[00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:47.539]  You think gamblers like to go bet the house because they get a thrill off watching go around the roulette wheel?
[00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:48.679]  That's what the globalists do.
[00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.260]  They are getting off on this.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.219]  They love putting the whole planet in danger.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.860]  It's thrilling to them.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.440]  They treat us like we're pawns and themselves like they're pawns because they are pawns of Satan.
[00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:03.480]  I refuse to go along with their plan.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.059]  All right, MTG's scheduled to be on.
[00:48:07.219 --> 00:48:07.860]  She's on the road.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.400]  She's going to pull over somewhere and try to Skype in or FaceTime in or Zoom in.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.460]  If there's any problems, we'll talk to her over the phone.
[00:48:13.539 --> 00:48:14.119]  I just want to talk to her.
[00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:15.219]  I don't care if she's on video or not.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.380]  I want to get her to take on all this insanity via newsmaking interview.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.400]  It'll move the needle against the enemy.
[00:48:21.679 --> 00:48:22.420]  So that's coming up.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.360]  We got a special guest in here I had set up months ago.
[00:48:24.519 --> 00:48:24.820]  Very interesting.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.800]  I'll tell you about him when he gets here.
[00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:31.570]  I'm so angry I've popped a blood vessel in my eye screaming on air.
[00:48:31.769 --> 00:48:32.389]  Give me a close shot.
[00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:33.429]  I want to make this a big part of the show.
[00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:34.130]  Look at that.
[00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.170]  That's how angry I am.
[00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.250]  Well, I know what...
[00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.050]  Only when I get really pissed is that going on.
[00:48:44.769 --> 00:48:45.969]  Because there's a desperation...
[00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.030]  There's an urgency of the enemy.
[00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:55.210]  And they're in control of the nuclear weapons and the bureaucracy and the power grid and the bioweapons.
[00:48:55.349 --> 00:49:00.869]  So when they're cornered, because they cornered us, we had to corner them, we're all in grave danger.
[00:49:00.869 --> 00:49:02.849]  We're at a real inflection point here.
[00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:07.289]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour, get to the clubs, get to all of it.
[00:49:08.389 --> 00:49:15.920]  The sale of the AlexJonesStore.com is so big, this morning when I saw it, Because I don't run it.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.599]  It's a great sponsor.
[00:49:16.679 --> 00:49:17.340]  They do a fabulous job.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.000]  I said, I know what the numbers here are.
[00:49:19.679 --> 00:49:23.699]  Do you guys know you did a loss leader sale on a bunch of the products?
[00:49:26.219 --> 00:49:32.260]  And of course, I was given the product plug and it said 20% off at the AlexJoneStore.com.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.460]  And I said, well, everything's at least 30 to 55% off.
[00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:42.940]  And I said, on the 55% off stuff, we're only making like 25, 30%.
[00:49:44.139 --> 00:49:45.599]  And that's in between the sponsor and everybody.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.639]  So we have to sell a lot to make money to operate.
[00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:49.719]  So I did the math.
[00:49:51.079 --> 00:49:54.619]  Well, first I asked, I said, is that 20% on top?
[00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:55.739]  We ended all the sales?
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.019]  They went, no, we didn't end the sales.
[00:49:57.179 --> 00:49:58.619]  That's on top of it at checkout.
[00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:02.940]  So I did the math and I said, well, that's a loss leader on quite a bit of the products.
[00:50:03.679 --> 00:50:05.139]  Or basically we break even.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.099]  But I said, I guess we'll do it since you've launched it.
[00:50:08.159 --> 00:50:11.800]  You know, it's your company, great products that I work with and endorse and help come up with.
[00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:19.929]  But just an inside baseball on that, it's not 20% off on the products at thealexlessore.com.
[00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:27.130]  It's on top of up to 55% off on the incredible superfood CMOS capsules.
[00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:30.530]  When you get three bottles, it's 55.
[00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:31.550]  When you get one, it's 40.
[00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.449]  When you get two, it's 50.
[00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:40.969]  You add 20% to that, that's 75% off on things like the CMOS and the...
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:44.760]  Amazing.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.559]  Hydroforce electrolyte drink mix.
[00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:47.980]  And that's, we got to rename this.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:53.219]  You know, this has got all the vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other really badass stuff in it.
[00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:55.320]  This is beyond your average.
[00:50:55.679 --> 00:50:57.800]  This is like vitamin, you know, drink.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.800]  Mineral, vitamin, mineral drink with electrolytes and tastes great and is super good.
[00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:06.579]  And that's discounted 75% off.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.059]  We'll lose money on that.
[00:51:08.199 --> 00:51:08.840]  Okay, whatever.
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.500]  I'm not the one running it.
[00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.670]  But what I do need you to do is go get some of the fundraiser t-shirts.
[00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:16.949]  You know, all of them are fundraisers.
[00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.570]  But the shirts cost like 15 bucks a piece on average because they're high quality.
[00:51:21.869 --> 00:51:23.510]  Like an XXL is like 16 bucks.
[00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:24.909]  Little ones like 13 bucks.
[00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.889]  Just for the shirt.
[00:51:25.989 --> 00:51:26.730]  Then they got to print it.
[00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:27.929]  Everything else.
[00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.769]  So we've got the classic Infowars red on navy blue for $50.
[00:51:32.449 --> 00:51:37.090]  And we've got the Rebellion to Tyrants' Obedience to God Punisher style shirt.
[00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.269]  Those are the two most popular.
[00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.230]  They're the fundraiser shirts.

[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.349]  But with the sale, that's 20% off those, which is fine.
[00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:54.260]  Just at a certain point, you've got to look at sales and see, do they actually break even?
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.380]  Because then you don't stay open.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.820]  But whatever.

[00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:08.699]  The work we're doing here is the most important, period.

[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.920]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[00:52:39.099 --> 00:52:54.809]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[00:52:55.409 --> 00:52:56.269]  and more.

[00:53:04.269 --> 00:53:09.590]  And then it funds my broadcast, And the crew and all of us continuing on.

[00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.409]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.190]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[00:53:48.449 --> 00:53:49.829]  It's a superfood.
[00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:50.750]  It's a pre-workout.
[00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:51.710]  It's a post-workout.
[00:53:51.869 --> 00:53:55.510]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[00:53:56.119 --> 00:54:05.460]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:12.320]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[00:54:12.539 --> 00:54:14.659]  This baby is next level.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.619]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.

[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.619]  So there's a line out the door.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:44.119]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.699]  And why is that?
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.420]  Well, it's simple.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.360]  This is called Ultimate HydroForce Electrolyte Drink Mix.

[00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:37.929]  And I read an article from the New York Times that Bill Gates had just donated $50 million to Kamala Harris' campaign.
[00:55:38.429 --> 00:55:45.329]  And the article said that it was the first donation that he's made in 20 years.
[00:55:46.289 --> 00:55:48.389]  That he stayed out of politics.
[00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:51.670]  It was a dark money donation.
[00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:55.170]  He didn't intend for it to be public.
[00:55:56.519 --> 00:56:10.579]  He routed the donation through a 501, which was an organization that was set up to conceal large money donations to the Harris campaign.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:15.239]  Do you think he made it out of a humanitarian impulse?
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.340]  Well, there was something else, another article about Bill Gates.
[00:56:23.599 --> 00:56:26.699]  It came out today that said he has just been indicted.
[00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:48.030]  A court in the Netherlands has ruled that Bill Gates, along with other defendants, including Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, must stand trial over allegations related to injuries caused by COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:59.869]  The case, brought by seven plaintiffs, claims that Gates and others misled the public about the safety of these vaccines, asserting they knew the vaccines were not safe or effective.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:12.739]  This legal action represents a significant challenge to Gates, focusing on his role in the global push for vaccinations through his foundation's involvement in the pandemic response.
[00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:27.349]  We should have free speech, but if you're inciting violence, if you're causing people not to take vaccines, you know, where are those boundaries that even the U.S., Should, you know, have rules.
[00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.269]  And then if you have rules, you know, what is it?
[00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:39.969]  Is there some AI that encodes those rules because you have billions of activity and, you know, if you catch it a day later, the harm is done.
[00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:47.369]  In my medical opinion, these are the most toxic pharmaceutical products that have ever been released on the market.
[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.829]  And, of course, most profitable.
[00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.949]  As we heard from Dr.
[00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:58.130]  Julie Paness, Pfizer last year made revenues of over $100 billion.
[00:57:58.869 --> 00:57:59.829]  That's just Pfizer.
[00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:01.230]  That doesn't include Moderna.
[00:58:01.369 --> 00:58:02.469]  That doesn't include BioNTech.
[00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:05.570]  Of course, you had AstraZeneca, Johnson& Johnson, and so on.
[00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:09.110]  This is a multi-hundred billion dollar industry.
[00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:16.030]  And it seems that nobody cares how many people get hurt, how many people get injured, how many people die.
[00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:28.829]  And to give you an idea for the scale of the vaccine injuries, 10-15%, this is straight out of CDC, V-safe data, where people were actually recording their side effects into an app.
[00:58:28.969 --> 00:58:32.769]  About 10 million people, they didn't want to release the data, they were forced to release it.
[00:58:33.269 --> 00:58:35.969]  About 10-15% have had a serious injury.
[00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:39.090]  About 1% have been permanently disabled.
[00:58:40.579 --> 00:58:43.380]  This is coming out of U.S. insurance data.
[00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.659]  Edward Dowd has been reporting on this.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.940]  And about 0.1% have died.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:59.050]  These are excess deaths that are unexplainable And 0.1% may not sound like a lot, but that's one in a thousand.
[00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:19.639]  Why did it take numerous legal demands, multiple appeals, two lawsuits in fact, before the CDC finally handed over the V-safe data, which is already de-identified data for the most part that they provided, Just two days ago, 144 million lines of code that they could have provided in a matter of minutes at any point.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:34.800]  Now that we have the data, we can see that getting the vaccine caused 25% of people who got the shot within this data set of 10 million people to miss work, to have some serious event affecting their normal life functions.
[00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:53.809]  The lawsuit was filed in Levarden, challenging the jurisdiction of the Dutch court over Gates, who resides in the U.S. However, the court dismissed Gates' objection, establishing jurisdiction due to the interconnectedness of the claims against all defendants,
[00:59:54.090 --> 01:00:00.690]  which are rooted in a common set of facts concerning the global response to the COVID-19 crisis.
[01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:13.900]  This ruling could set a precedent for similar cases globally, Highlighting the complexities of international law when dealing with high-profile figures involved in worldwide health initiatives.
[01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:17.440]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.019]  We are now into hour number two of this Friday, October 25th, 2024 transmission.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:32.579]  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene joins us live from the road with only 10 days out from this insanely important election.
[01:00:33.099 --> 01:00:48.400]  And I wanted to get her take, because it seems like a lifetime since she was on last Friday with us seven days ago, of the open claims by all of these pundits and Kamala and Biden and Hillary that the military is going to be used by Trump,
[01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.300]  That he's going to kill black people with no evidence?
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.619]  That he's a Nazi for having a rally at Madison Square Garden?
[01:00:58.759 --> 01:01:01.519]  We're good to go.
[01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:33.530]  So looking at all this, you've really got your head in the game, unlike anybody else except for a few people like Trump and Matt Gaetz.
[01:01:33.909 --> 01:01:36.889]  What's the word on what's really going on right now?
[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.309]  It's clearly Kamala collapses further.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.829]  The numbers all show Trump surging.
[01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.849]  What's your snapshot of things right now?
[01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:50.230]  What we're seeing is we're seeing complete panic with the Democrats.
[01:01:50.989 --> 01:01:53.769]  We're seeing complete panic in Kamala Harris.
[01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.289]  The rural vote is turning out in record numbers.
[01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:02.010]  And we're seeing that in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona.
[01:02:02.449 --> 01:02:03.530]  The numbers are incredible.
[01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:09.150]  North Carolina is amazing, even though they had all that devastation with Hurricane Helene.
[01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:12.150]  And Kamala Harris and the Democrats are completely panicking.
[01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:14.170]  They never expected this.
[01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:17.710]  I mean, let's go through the list, Alex.
[01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:20.530]  They impeached President Trump.
[01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:23.349]  They have slandered President Trump.
[01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:26.750]  They have labeled him every evil name on the planet.
[01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:28.250]  They have sued him.
[01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:29.329]  They have indicted him.
[01:02:29.489 --> 01:02:30.809]  They shot him in the face.
[01:02:30.949 --> 01:02:32.849]  They have continued to try to kill him.
[01:02:32.989 --> 01:02:35.389]  And America is coming out like never before.
[01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:41.510]  We're good to go.
[01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:59.750]  We're good to go.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.579]  Saying that Trump admired Hitler is absolutely a big lie.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:10.599]  But the biggest lie that she is telling is that he will use the military against the American people.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.699]  That is completely not true.
[01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:20.440]  The only regime that has weaponized the government against the American people is the Biden-Harris administration.
[01:03:20.989 --> 01:03:24.269]  And they have weaponized the government against their political enemies.
[01:03:24.849 --> 01:03:26.969]  They arrested Donald Trump.
[01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.969]  That is who arrested Donald Trump.
[01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.809]  They're trying to put him in prison.
[01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:35.250]  He still has a sentencing date coming up on November 18th in New York.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.429]  This is their reality.
[01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:47.980]  No matter what the headlines say, no matter how much they lie about it, the American people know the reality And I'm hoping that they will turn out like never before, Alex.
[01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:56.380]  But the reality is, we still have approximately 13% or so of people that go to Trump rallies that don't even vote.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:03.099]  So the only way to win this election is to make it too big to rig and just flood the polls and vote.
[01:04:03.179 --> 01:04:04.320]  We have a short time left.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.380]  I totally agree with you.
[01:04:07.519 --> 01:04:11.579]  As you know, Raskin and many other Democrats have said they're not going to certify a Trump win.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:23.300]  It would be Harris who would decide to not certify that as the VP. They clearly now have said they're going to use a contested election to try to create civil unrest.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.300]  And that's why they're telegraphing ahead that Trump's going to use the military.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.619]  But as you know, we talked about it last week.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.519]  And now RFK Jr.
[01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:32.440]  has talked about it and others.
[01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:33.880]  They've signed this order.
[01:04:34.019 --> 01:04:37.000]  They put out this military report for civil unrest and lethal force.
[01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:40.019]  They're doing what they claim Trump will do.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.000]  What do you think the deep state's getting ready to try?
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.599]  Well, actually, it's a more comprehensive plan.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:55.920]  So the Department of Defense is now authorized to use military force to assist law enforcement.
[01:04:56.179 --> 01:05:02.079]  That's what the directive says against the American people in a case of civil unrest.
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:13.030]  There's also been an order given to put up the fencing to erect it around the Capitol, starting on January 5th, going past the inauguration date.
[01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:26.980]  That will be happening in Washington, D.C. The mayor of D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, requested that January 6th be declared a special security event.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:37.019]  And so Secretary Mayorkas of the Department of Homeland Security, who we impeached, by the way, he has taken over and declared January 6th.
[01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:45.489]  We're good to go.
[01:05:45.489 --> 01:05:55.750]  We're good to go.
[01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:59.519]  Then what are they expecting to happen in January, Alex?
[01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:04.239]  And I think that's a bigger concern of mine.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:09.639]  Also, many of us are concerned about noncitizens voting in the election.
[01:06:10.219 --> 01:06:12.119]  I think that is our greatest threat.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.780]  You know, never forget the Democrat Party, their candidate right now never received a single Democrat primary vote.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.380]  This is the party that's defending democracy.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.539]  The party that's defending democracy, they don't care about violence.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.840]  They don't care about riots.
[01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:32.300]  They nearly burned down Washington, D.C. on Trump's inauguration in 2017.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:40.199]  They nearly burned down America in the summer of 2020 with all of the BLM riots.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.940]  And they cheered them on.
[01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:48.920]  And Kamala Harris The Minnesota Freedom Fund bail bond link, bailing out criminal rioters.
[01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:53.500]  This is a party that is not concerned about violence or civil uprising.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:07:00.219]  As a matter of fact, they love violence and civil uprising when it goes with what they're pushing for.
[01:07:00.659 --> 01:07:03.900]  So it's a complete hypocrisy.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:10.059]  Their actions do not match their words, and that shows you who they really are.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.900]  They're genuinely evil, and they're lying.
[01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:20.190]  Congresswoman, you're dead on here.
[01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:32.289]  There's multiple deep state Democrat plans where they say if he does win, they're not going to certify, but they're going to try to put the states now into multiple weeks of counting and hysteria.
[01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:37.570]  Then they have their surrogates on TV saying Trump supporters are going to get violent with no evidence.
[01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:56.050]  Clearly the last pieces of that is, just like the FBI tried to get We're good to go.
[01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:10.989]  Of them saying Trump supporters are going to get violent, Trump's Hitler, and that they're going to do stuff during the contested election, is that actual violence happening?
[01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:13.710]  And of course, we don't have to even say it because everybody knows it.
[01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:16.369]  We're not calling for violence and we're winning politically.
[01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:21.529]  But I'm very, very concerned about extrapolating out where these talking points are going.
[01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:24.789]  Well, you know, we're not calling for violence.
[01:08:24.989 --> 01:08:26.130]  We don't want any violence.
[01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:29.350]  We want to win the election, and that's what we're working on doing.
[01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.850]  There's also something else going on, Alex.
[01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:34.210]  The courts are taking over the election.
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:39.350]  You know, I just saw the Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, being interviewed by Jake Tapper.
[01:08:39.409 --> 01:08:51.699]  I saw a clip just before our show here where A judge has taken control and ordered Virginia to stop removing non-citizens from the voter rolls.
[01:08:53.739 --> 01:08:59.659]  When judges are stepping in and taking control of elections like this, I think that's the bigger threat.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:07.979]  And when we have a court deciding the outcome of the election, that's another greater threat to our country.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.479]  That's a greater threat to our election integrity.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.939]  The American people own the elections.
[01:09:13.159 --> 01:09:16.420]  The American people pay for the elections through their tax dollars.
[01:09:16.659 --> 01:09:30.420]  They pay for the voting machines, no matter how threatening these voting machine companies I want to be with their public statements of threatening lawsuits against people for saying they don't want voting machines, which is ridiculous.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:43.869]  But when we have judges and courts stepping in, and we have legal challenges, lawsuits, That are going to drag out the results of our election on November 5th.
[01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.869]  That shows you our election process is completely wrong.
[01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:50.909]  And it shows you that it's not election integrity.
[01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:52.270]  These are not safe elections.
[01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.529]  We should be able to have the outcome of our election easily.
[01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.369]  It should be able to be declared election night.
[01:09:58.529 --> 01:10:00.829]  This is how other countries are capable of doing it.
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:03.430]  They have voter ID. They use paper ballots.
[01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:12.010]  And they're able to count up We're good to go.
[01:10:12.029 --> 01:10:21.869]  We're good to go.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:37.340]  I hope to God we never see violence in this country like we have seen in the years past, and that's come through the Democrats.
[01:10:37.579 --> 01:10:39.300]  The Democrats are the party of violence.
[01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:41.789]  The Democrats are the party of civil unrest.
[01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:44.670]  The Democrats are the party destroying democracy.
[01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:54.430]  The Democrats are the party of vulgarity, of absolute sexual impurity, sexual propaganda being forced on our kids.
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.750]  Everything completely disgusting is coming from the Democrats.
[01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:06.630]  So I don't think we're going to see a very quick outcome on November 5th unless we have so many people vote that they can't.
[01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:08.670]  It's too big to rig and I want to see that happen.
[01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:16.789]  And you've been predicting for years this would happen at this critical election, and they had a lot of fraud baked in in 2016, but it wasn't enough.
[01:11:16.949 --> 01:11:18.869]  Look at Arizona.
[01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:28.250]  They always had the elections on Election Day, and then magically after Trump wins, then by 2018, this now continues, and then it's all up in the air.
[01:11:28.369 --> 01:11:30.850]  So then the courts decide it's more lawfare.
[01:11:30.949 --> 01:11:34.670]  It's the bureaucracy, the blue cities, the Democrat-funded Soros individuals.
[01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:36.529]  We saw the lady running for governor against...
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.880]  Carrie Lake deciding her own election.
[01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:45.899]  Now they're saying they're gonna block the certification and it'll be Kamala that would be the vote over that.
[01:11:46.079 --> 01:12:00.819]  So They tried to criticize you and gaslight the public that you were crazy last Friday to say you're worried about election integrity, but major polls are out, 65 to 85 depending on the poll, but it's all over 60% of Americans are concerned too.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.100]  And we have evidence of all of this manipulation going on.
[01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:13.239]  And as you pointed out, all over the country, the feds are threatening states with criminal action and lawsuits and judges are ruling and saying keep those illegals on the ballot.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.520]  And in...
[01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:19.300]  Places like Michigan, 500,000 phantom voters that were never on the voter rolls.
[01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:21.399]  And they denied that those were there before.
[01:12:21.539 --> 01:12:22.460]  Now they admit they're there.
[01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:24.800]  Republicans paid to go do the research and show it.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.239]  And then, boom, they go, okay, well, we're keeping them on there.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.060]  We'll fix it later.
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:30.300]  So this is going on.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:36.020]  And really, as negative as that is, this is the mask coming off right now.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.500]  And I've never seen such an awakening.
[01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:40.899]  What are you seeing from your constituents, but also when you're on Capitol Hill?
[01:12:41.819 --> 01:12:42.220]  Yeah.
[01:12:43.319 --> 01:12:52.060]  When we have Democrats literally going to court to stop states like Virginia from taking non-citizens off of the voter rolls, then we know what their play is.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.720]  They want to steal the election with people who are not citizens voting in our elections.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.819]  That's why they flooded this country with millions and millions of people.
[01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:07.760]  Not only to destabilize America totally and completely, but to also be able to steal the election with non-citizen votes.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.920]  This is why they're going to also use the ballots coming in from overseas.
[01:13:13.319 --> 01:13:15.619]  That process is so easy for voter fraud.
[01:13:15.779 --> 01:13:17.380]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:30.140]  So when we're seeing all these challenges come up and it's all about stopping noncitizens from being taken off the voter rolls and them fighting for noncitizens to vote in the election.
[01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:32.770]  And we know exactly how they want to steal it.
[01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:36.449]  I will tell you another state that I'm starting to be concerned about is Texas.
[01:13:37.569 --> 01:13:39.369]  Kamala Harris is going to Texas.
[01:13:39.529 --> 01:13:44.550]  I think she's coming to Austin and having Beyonce perform at her big rally.
[01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:52.189]  There's no reason for Kamala Harris to waste time, money and resources coming to Texas unless they think Texas is in play.
[01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.489]  We're good to go.
[01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:11.329]  We're good to go.
[01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:25.989]  I mean, he's great.
[01:14:26.369 --> 01:14:32.949]  Attorney General Ken Paxton says he can't prosecute voter fraud in the state of Texas.
[01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:36.800]  And then you've got I don't know.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.119]  I'm concerned about Texas.
[01:14:38.319 --> 01:14:41.340]  I think 40 or 41 electoral college votes.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.260]  That totally wipes out the swing states.
[01:14:43.539 --> 01:14:44.319]  Georgia won't matter.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.399]  Pennsylvania won't matter.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.020]  North Carolina.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.060]  None of these states will matter if they are somehow able to take Texas.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.180]  Exactly.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:15:00.060]  While we're watching Georgia and Pennsylvania and Arizona and Michigan, they swoop in and still Texas, which the Democrats have been bragging, they plan on doing.
[01:15:00.199 --> 01:15:03.079]  And we know Texas, other than California, has the most illegals.
[01:15:03.239 --> 01:15:07.960]  They've busted a bunch of Democrat groups in San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, registering illegals.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:08.840]  People have been arrested.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.520]  They've caught them running all sorts of scams.
[01:15:11.579 --> 01:15:28.020]  The few minutes we have left, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, President Trump traveling over the whole country, surging everywhere, Kamala floundering, even their cook polls showing Trump's ahead, the big betting markets all showing total Trump surge,
[01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:28.920]  Trump way ahead.
[01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:33.539]  I don't see how the public's gonna buy it if they try to steal it again.
[01:15:33.699 --> 01:15:49.380]  And as you said, it's once they're really planning I think?
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:11.760]  We're good to go.
[01:16:16.449 --> 01:16:17.369]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:24.050]  I mean, the Democrat is the party of violence, but yet they want to continue and say that that's who we are and we are not.
[01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:31.130]  But the Democrats were the party of Occupy Wall Street, the Occupy movement in Oregon, Antifa.
[01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:32.649]  They created Antifa.
[01:16:32.829 --> 01:16:34.510]  They have protected Antifa.
[01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.229]  They have never prosecuted Antifa.
[01:16:38.649 --> 01:16:46.560]  This is the party that declared The BLM riots all over the country and fueled them and funded them and cheered them on.
[01:16:47.039 --> 01:16:49.840]  This is the party that has tried to kill.
[01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.720]  Democrats tried to kill Trump.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.420]  It was not a foreign plan.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.539]  The Democrats that tried to, one, Thomas Crookes shot him in the face, and the other Democrat that was arrested waiting on the golf course, and other attempts, these have been Democrats.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.840]  So this is the party of violence.
[01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:12.050]  This is the party of civil unrest.
[01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:17.869]  This is the party destabilizing America with a daily invasion across our southern border.
[01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:21.970]  This is the party that's destroying our economy with out of control inflation.
[01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.170]  Democrats are the party of destruction.
[01:17:25.569 --> 01:17:28.029]  And they're going to destroy our elections.
[01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.369]  They've already started to do that in 2020.
[01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:32.170]  The process has already begun.
[01:17:32.289 --> 01:17:34.229]  It's probably been going on longer than we think.
[01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:37.329]  And it's right to demand election integrity.
[01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.470]  I don't care what the press says about me.
[01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:41.310]  I don't care what they write in the headlines.
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.149]  It is the right thing to do.
[01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:50.789]  And the American people say the exact same thing I'm saying is that we don't trust that our elections are safe.
[01:17:51.079 --> 01:17:56.060]  Because the Democrats are trying to get non-citizens voting in our elections.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:00.640]  They're fighting us in court because they want non-citizens to vote.
[01:18:00.899 --> 01:18:03.239]  They fight us on the absentee ballot.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:09.720]  We want protections in our elections so that absentee ballots cannot be stolen and rigged.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.180]  We want protections with how we vote.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.279]  We want paper ballots.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.340]  And you know what?
[01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:20.409]  We should never feel threatened by a voting machine company for saying that.
[01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:22.430]  We should never feel threatened.
[01:18:22.449 --> 01:18:23.649]  And that was my next question.
[01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:28.149]  All you did last Friday was report what a constituent was saying to you.
[01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:34.909]  And they had all these headlines about, well, MTG and Alex Jones get sued for saying this company's engaged in this.
[01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:38.270]  They make a claim that we made a claim that we didn't make.
[01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:41.670]  They make the claim and then blame us for the claim they're making.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.460]  Yeah, I didn't blame a voting machine company.
[01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:49.100]  I said what was happening.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.159]  I'm a representative of the people.
[01:18:51.579 --> 01:18:54.539]  My job title literally is representative.
[01:18:55.119 --> 01:18:57.100]  So I am representing the people in my district.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.199]  I said what my people were saying.
[01:18:59.539 --> 01:19:04.380]  I just was saying, here's what people are saying and here's how you overcome it.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.479]  I told people to go in and vote.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.699]  I told them to double check their paper ballot, make sure the selections were correct.
[01:19:11.949 --> 01:19:14.550]  Make sure that it didn't get changed on the machine.
[01:19:14.909 --> 01:19:23.149]  If it does get changed, go get an election worker, get them to help you vote and get it right, and then turn it in once you know it's correct.
[01:19:23.829 --> 01:19:27.050]  That's not slandering anybody, any company.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:33.039]  That's literally telling people how to make sure that their vote is secure and encouraging them to vote.
[01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:43.039]  Alex, when I get off, I'm going to send you a video compilation of Democrats attacking voting machines.
[01:19:43.319 --> 01:19:49.619]  Talking about how votes can be stolen, votes can be flipped, and talking about all the problems with voting machines.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.739]  And this is all the stuff they used to say before 2020.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.880]  And you can play that on your show, break it up however you want, share it on your social media.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:01.640]  But the reality is, it's not just me that's been saying that.
[01:20:01.779 --> 01:20:05.579]  It's not just you, and it's not a whole bunch of voters across the country.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.399]  It's Democrats as well.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.960]  And we should not be sued for simply calling this out.
[01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:12.489]  It's just like this, Alex.
[01:20:12.609 --> 01:20:16.329]  It's like me saying, you know, I don't like this brand of coffee.
[01:20:16.569 --> 01:20:20.850]  I personally would like to choose another brand of coffee.
[01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.930]  So for me, I'm gonna say, I don't like voting on voting machines.
[01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.670]  I would like to vote on paper ballots.
[01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:29.569]  I shouldn't be sued for that.
[01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:30.989]  No one should be sued for that.
[01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:32.390]  You shouldn't be sued for that.
[01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:34.689]  The American people shouldn't be sued for that.
[01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.449]  Because again, I'll go back to this.
[01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:38.670]  The American people own the elections.
[01:20:39.159 --> 01:20:41.739]  They pay for it with their tax dollars.
[01:20:41.979 --> 01:20:54.319]  If the American people are demanding to be able to vote with paper ballots and day of, no one can hold them hostage and no one can threaten to sue them because that's what they're demanding.
[01:20:54.779 --> 01:20:57.680]  Because again, Alex, the American people own the elections.
[01:20:58.659 --> 01:20:59.079]  Absolutely.
[01:20:59.079 --> 01:21:00.720]  Congresswoman, thank you so much for the time.
[01:21:00.779 --> 01:21:01.539]  You're very gracious.
[01:21:01.739 --> 01:21:02.600]  I know you're praying for Trump.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.460]  We're praying for Trump.
[01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.319]  And we are for peace.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.539]  As you said, the establishment is desperate.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.800]  They're signing orders for martial law, for killing American citizens, and then saying Trump's going to do it.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.260]  They're planning some major triggers to be blamed on Trump supporters.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.159]  We are getting ahead of this.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.100]  That is so incredibly important.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.340]  They're the ones in the key blue cities in the battleground states.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.579]  They're going to hold up the election.
[01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:33.989]  As the cover, and we are aware of it, and this time I agree with you, the evidence is the landslide is going to be too big for them to rig, so...
[01:21:48.739 --> 01:21:54.239]  I mean, that isn't thin.
[01:21:54.539 --> 01:21:56.199]  That is comically ridiculous.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.439]  It's ridiculous.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:04.079]  So are they saying that every event that is held at Madison Square Garden is a Nazi event?
[01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.140]  I mean, how outrageous is that?
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:11.399]  They just continue to lie and they continue to lie and that's because they're desperate and they have nothing else.
[01:22:11.619 --> 01:22:13.840]  They don't have policies that people agree with.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.159]  As a matter of fact, people hate their policies.
[01:22:16.659 --> 01:22:19.199]  No one is happier today than they were four years ago.
[01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:39.210]  As a matter of fact, people don't have as much money We're good to go.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.039]  Congresswoman, thank you so much.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.659]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:23:10.779 --> 01:23:12.399]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[01:23:12.699 --> 01:23:13.880]  It's not just a detox.
[01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:17.180]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[01:23:17.479 --> 01:23:18.500]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.899]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.859]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:28.109]  And it goes on and on.
[01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:29.789]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:30.970]  They're concentrated.
[01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.989]  They're incredible.
[01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:37.470]  You want to get it right now at thealefshonestore.com for between 30% and 50% off.
[01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:40.869]  50% off when you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:43.109]  There's the Trump feed.
[01:23:44.949 --> 01:23:46.850]  Is that him at the airport or at Rogan's?
[01:23:49.559 --> 01:23:50.079]  Airport.
[01:23:50.079 --> 01:23:51.140]  All right, great.
[01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:53.319]  We've got the initiative.
[01:23:53.899 --> 01:23:54.939]  We are winning.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:55.920]  We are surging.
[01:23:56.279 --> 01:23:58.979]  The tyrants are scared, but they are very dangerous.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:00.859]  And they control the bureaucracy.
[01:24:00.859 --> 01:24:02.020]  They control the Justice Department.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.460]  They control most of the corporate media.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.340]  They control big tech of the next.
[01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:10.340]  And they are making their move right now to openly try to steal the election.
[01:24:11.069 --> 01:24:13.229]  To make it contested, to try to create civil unrest.
[01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:17.430]  If that doesn't work, civil unrest, once he's president, all hell breaks loose.
[01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:23.189]  This will not be like a normal election where the president gets in or there's a new guard and then things settle down for a while.
[01:24:23.569 --> 01:24:27.569]  Things are just going to get more insane from here on out for the rest of your lives.
[01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.989]  Guaranteed of that.
[01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:38.319]  You got front row seats to the AI and the supercomputers and the robots and the Total insanity.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:46.199]  I mean, we are living in an incredibly dynamic, wonderful, horrible time.
[01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:48.060]  I mean, everything's going on.
[01:24:48.119 --> 01:24:49.020]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:24:50.439 --> 01:24:52.439]  Alright, I had this guest set up weeks ago.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.239]  He's really smart.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:53.920]  Know him a while.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.579]  I'm not trying to make it a Joe Rogan-centric program.
[01:24:56.699 --> 01:24:58.180]  He's also Joe Rogan's...
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:15.579]  We're good to go.
[01:25:16.409 --> 01:25:23.289]  And I said, you've got to come on the air and just talk about the New World Order and everything in general because he's just as informed as I am, or more so in many ways.
[01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:28.750]  So look for Brigham coming up in the third and fourth hour.
[01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:31.390]  We'll host both of them and cover all the news while it unfolds.
[01:25:32.649 --> 01:25:38.409]  It won't be until the war room is basically probably almost over tonight that the Rogan interview with Trump is going to come out.
[01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:40.289]  That's getting more attention than the debates.
[01:25:40.449 --> 01:25:40.850]  That's great.
[01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:46.970]  Finally, Trump's getting that the alternative media has been the real media for over a decade.
[01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:49.689]  CNN's top shows have a million views.
[01:25:49.869 --> 01:25:51.750]  Joe Rogan's normal shows have 30 million.
[01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.449]  This will have 500 million views.
[01:25:56.659 --> 01:25:58.020]  The clips will have billions of views.
[01:25:58.159 --> 01:26:03.399]  I mean, he went on with Elon and had a billion people that watched and listened to the stream.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.399]  And then why was he back on there every week?
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.560]  Trump's like, yeah, alternative media is pretty big now.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:10.979]  No.
[01:26:11.899 --> 01:26:18.760]  It's like saying in the year 2024, you know, automobiles are really going to give horses a run for their money in transportation.
[01:26:20.279 --> 01:26:28.590]  But for 78-year-old people who grew up watching television, They still think television is the king daddy.
[01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:31.050]  Cable television.
[01:26:32.569 --> 01:26:33.470]  Broadcast television.
[01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:38.550]  But to young people, I tell them, I'm on 300 and something radio stations.
[01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:39.430]  What are those?
[01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:42.189]  Why are there ads on your show?
[01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:46.250]  Because to folks under 30 or so, they're like, why are there ads on this show?
[01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:48.909]  Well, because we're on radio stations.
[01:26:48.909 --> 01:26:49.829]  We get half the ads.
[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:50.569]  They get half the ads.
[01:26:50.569 --> 01:26:54.630]  It's called network radio, network TV. So I've got a foot in both worlds.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.680]  Always have, because I came along when both were there.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:09.239]  The internet was really getting going, and been around for decades, but really getting popular, and audio and video were becoming available to the general public.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.500]  And so I've lived in both worlds.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.880]  You've got to remember, older folks didn't live in the internet world, and younger people didn't live in the old broadcast world.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.340]  So...
[01:27:20.779 --> 01:27:26.340]  You could say the corporate media was dead decades ago, but they figured out they were dead the last few years, and they're trying to shut down all their competition.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:31.239]  But now, even Trump and people are like, whoa.
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:38.359]  Okay, I go on, I mean, he goes on medium-sized podcasts and normally get like a half million views, and he gets 20 million.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.380]  He goes on big podcasts and get 20 million, they get 50 million.
[01:27:41.659 --> 01:27:43.979]  He goes on the top podcast and, you know, gets 100 million.
[01:27:45.579 --> 01:27:47.560]  So that's where this is all going.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:28:03.619]  And I've told the Trump campaign, hey, Elon would have him down for a conference for Pennsylvania and do a question and answer and then do it on X and also streaming on Spaces and it would get a billion views again.
[01:28:04.619 --> 01:28:09.060]  I mean, that's more than all his big corporate media appearances combined.
[01:28:10.199 --> 01:28:14.619]  So it's kind of like Trump's fighting with a pocket knife when he can be fighting with a battle axe.
[01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:18.710]  And the corporate media knows this.
[01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:20.890]  That's why they want to shut down the new media.
[01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:28.210]  They can't compete with Joe Rogan sitting down or Alex Jones sitting down or Tucker Carlson sitting down and having a two-hour conversation.
[01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:30.199]  Unscripted?
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.520]  And all the great points that come out and people know it's real?
[01:28:34.199 --> 01:28:38.340]  Compared to a teleprompter reading fence post as Mel Gibson called her?
[01:28:38.779 --> 01:28:40.560]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.140]  And so it's that old system's already dead.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:48.319]  It's trying to cling on to power by election theft, by civil unrest, by racial division.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.880]  And it's never gotten more beyond cartoonish.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.600]  I mean, Trump's a Nazi.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:58.239]  He's going to have a rally at Madison Square Garden and 80...
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:06.439]  Plus years ago, 84 years ago, the Nazis had a rally there.
[01:29:07.239 --> 01:29:07.680]  What?
[01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:14.539]  And so he's, I mean, that's just, it's sick.
[01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:20.140]  They're betting on low-information voters that just hear, I heard he went to that Nazi place.
[01:29:21.279 --> 01:29:21.880]  Mm-hmm.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:23.960]  Yeah, did you hear?
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.300]  Yeah.
[01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.390]  So, that's where we are now.
[01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:29.810]  I got the North Korean news.
[01:29:30.029 --> 01:29:30.750]  It's huge.
[01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:32.510]  I got a bunch of other election news.
[01:29:32.569 --> 01:29:32.890]  It's huge.
[01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:33.390]  I need to hit it.
[01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:39.409]  But if this was happening to somebody else, I'd be on it like white on rice.
[01:29:40.449 --> 01:29:41.869]  Or flies on you-know-what.
[01:29:43.369 --> 01:29:47.710]  But even Joe was asking about this last week because he'd seen it in the news.
[01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.649]  Sandy Hook families with Alex Jones on social media.
[01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:59.380]  And They're like, they want your name and your private social media?
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.260]  They can't do that.
[01:30:00.659 --> 01:30:03.039]  Well, you can't just know that because it's true.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:14.180]  I have to go out and get the IP lawyers, pay them, have them do the briefs, get ready for it, and then go into federal court because they're saying they own the name Alex Jones and I can't use that.
[01:30:14.739 --> 01:30:19.119]  Well, I didn't sign a 360 deal like Prince with Sony where they own my name.
[01:30:20.079 --> 01:30:23.000]  Yeah, you can sign your name away by contract, but I never did that.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.640]  My whole broadcast has always been free to air a gift for the world.
[01:30:25.819 --> 01:30:31.300]  We have contracts on the website 20 years ago, and 10 years ago, and five years ago, and my films say it at the start and the end.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.520]  So I've told them, I'm going to contest this, and I'm going to sue you.
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:42.340]  And we've got the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department, the new one, the last one got fired by the judge.
[01:30:42.819 --> 01:30:45.020]  Tell me to my face, no, we're not going to sell your name.
[01:30:45.159 --> 01:30:46.399]  No, we're not going to sell Real Locks Jones.
[01:30:46.479 --> 01:30:47.520]  We know we don't have rights to that.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:47.939]  It's clear.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.939]  And the judge shot it down on June 14th when they tried the last time.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:01.100]  So now the U.S. trustee has put it out for sale on the 13th of November.
[01:31:01.619 --> 01:31:03.140]  What is that, just 18 days away?
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:15.119]  And he says, no, we're putting up for sale the name Alex Jones and real Alex Jones and all the archives of the show and his book rights into the future.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.720]  Anything he ever does, we own him.
[01:31:17.279 --> 01:31:18.880]  That's slavery into the 13th Amendment.
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.739]  So, my lawyers get up in Houston this morning at 9 a.m.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.460]  with the judge, Chris Lopez, who's a good federal judge, appointed by Trump.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.560]  He didn't do me any favors if he follows the law.
[01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:38.340]  And my lawyers say, yeah, well, they can't own this.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:44.539]  And the other lawyers, the Democrat Party, Sandy Hook people, and the U.S. trustees said, no, we own it, it's ours.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.220]  And the judge said, I'm not doing this.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.779]  The sale is going to be off now.
[01:31:49.319 --> 01:31:51.539]  We're having an emergency hearing November 1st.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.020]  And you're going to show me the evidence you can own somebody's name.
[01:31:55.159 --> 01:31:56.619]  And where Alex Jones sold his name.
[01:31:56.699 --> 01:31:57.479]  I got it right here.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.699]  I was told this by the lawyers.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.579]  I was busy this morning.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.659]  I didn't watch the hearing.
[01:32:04.159 --> 01:32:06.600]  So now I've got the IP lawyers and all that.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.979]  They're going to go in and put their brief in.
[01:32:08.079 --> 01:32:10.500]  That affects the whole country and the whole world and your rights.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.699]  They set the precedent with me.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:13.960]  And that takes money.
[01:32:14.579 --> 01:32:16.619]  I'm up against the biggest Democrat law firms there are.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.060]  By the way, they went, oh, the Democrat law firms go, we need more time to prepare this brief.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.399]  Yeah, you're trying to steal my name.
[01:32:23.399 --> 01:32:24.340]  It's total fraud.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.720]  And so you bet you want to push this off.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.800]  You thought you just slipped this through, had the judge approve this.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:37.119]  Well, we had this emergency hearing today, and the judge said, this can't be done in just a few minutes.
[01:32:38.899 --> 01:32:41.260]  I'm going to budget six hours.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.420]  He's very busy, by the way.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.619]  One of the main federal judges.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.300]  On this next November 1st.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.199]  It's coming up in a few days.
[01:32:49.859 --> 01:32:50.180]  What is that?
[01:32:50.239 --> 01:32:50.899]  Eight days away.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.680]  So, here's the headline.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.819]  Alex Jones trustee bid to sell his social media paused by judge.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.420]  Well, it's Bloomberg.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:09.479]  It says in the filing, here's the filing, showed you last week, that they own the name Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.409 --> 01:33:15.770]  And on everything I've ever said or done, and they own my identity.
[01:33:17.210 --> 01:33:19.310]  And the judge said, I want to see you have the rights.
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:23.010]  And my lawyer started trying to put it on.
[01:33:23.029 --> 01:33:24.970]  He said, no, you need a full hearing on this.
[01:33:26.529 --> 01:33:32.090]  And the Sandy Hook Democrat Party law firm, it's actually the biggest one that represents Hillary Clinton, and it came out in court.
[01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:33.090]  She's all behind this, too.
[01:33:34.210 --> 01:33:37.130]  Literally said, we need a long time for this.
[01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:39.409]  We can't be ready in eight days.
[01:33:39.689 --> 01:33:40.850]  Judge says, well, you're going to be ready.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:48.119]  So they thought they'd just slip this through because I'm Alex Jones and I deserve it and they'd own my name.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.760]  And we got a lot of other action against these people in court coming soon.
[01:33:52.819 --> 01:33:53.460]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:33:53.579 --> 01:33:54.960]  I mean, real soon, next week.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.779]  You're going to see what's going to happen.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.460]  So they don't own all the courts in the country.
[01:34:02.539 --> 01:34:04.319]  There's still some courts that are equitable.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.600]  And where you have equity.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.479]  Where you have rights.
[01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:15.220]  Where there's equality.
[01:34:15.659 --> 01:34:16.619]  At some point.
[01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:20.960]  But you've got to have the money to go fight this when the big boys come after you.
[01:34:23.539 --> 01:34:23.939]  So...
[01:34:23.939 --> 01:34:27.979]  Like I said a few weeks ago, and like I said this week...
[01:34:27.979 --> 01:34:32.079]  Yeah, my phone rings and big podcasters call and say what's going on.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.439]  And I get a call from one of Elon Musk's big lawyers.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.220]  And people are like, wow, this is crazy.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.199]  And I'm like, yeah...
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.399]  I've been the main target of this along with Trump for a long time.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.340]  I told Trump eight years ago, six years ago, I said, they're taking me off the internet.
[01:34:44.399 --> 01:34:45.640]  They're going to take you off this stuff.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.399]  You better fight it.
[01:34:46.699 --> 01:34:48.020]  Oh, we're going to work on that.
[01:34:49.659 --> 01:34:50.920]  No, it's the big issue, Trump.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:51.539]  Look at Musk.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.140]  He gets it.
[01:34:52.479 --> 01:34:53.300]  Now Trump gets it.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.539]  So, I mean, if this was happening to Tucker Carlson, I'd be making a big deal about it.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.819]  If it was happening to Elon Musk, I'd be making a big deal about it.
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.270]  If it was happening to Joe Rogan, I'm making a big deal about it.
[01:35:09.909 --> 01:35:12.310]  But people still go, they're going to take your name?
[01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:13.750]  That's not true, Alex.
[01:35:14.489 --> 01:35:20.130]  Alex, you claim they sent armed security without a court order to shut you down 14 weeks ago.
[01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.710]  Come on.
[01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:22.970]  Even though it's in the news, people are like, ah, come on.
[01:35:23.569 --> 01:35:24.949]  People don't do that in America.
[01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:37.979]  Florida's now sued the feds and said that they are blocking the investigation into the shooter at Trump's Golf course.
[01:35:38.079 --> 01:35:38.479]  Of course they are.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.380]  I said that would happen the day it happened, on that Sunday.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:43.579]  Just like they're blocking the investigation of Pennsylvania.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.439]  Just like they've kidnapped or shipped in or allowed the kidnapping of 325,000 kids, they've disappeared.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:36:01.060]  The government is run by stark, raving, satanic, crime-obsessed megalomaniacs.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.300]  And if you study history, you see what crazy megalomaniacs do when they get power.
[01:36:05.539 --> 01:36:06.720]  It's stuff like this.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.779]  So, you're living in tyranny.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.239]  They want to cement the tyranny.
[01:36:11.359 --> 01:36:12.619]  They want to complete the tyranny.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.079]  They want to break your back.
[01:36:15.539 --> 01:36:23.659]  I'm one of their main targets, because I'll get up here and say, well, they're saying Trump's going to kill black people and Hispanics, and then he's Hitler.
[01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.340]  Imminently, it's clear they're getting ready to stage that.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.720]  I mean, that's not rocket science.
[01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:33.710]  But no one else will just make the leap.
[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:37.229]  And it's a leap of like stepping over a crack in the sidewalk.
[01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:43.090]  They don't want future discussions.
[01:36:43.449 --> 01:36:45.649]  They want you all in the set moment.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.260]  With all the little factoids and all the stuff coming at you, until you're so overwhelmed, instead of pulling back and going, what's the globalist plan?
[01:36:52.319 --> 01:36:52.819]  Who are they?
[01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:54.199]  How are they operating?
[01:36:54.359 --> 01:36:55.220]  What do they say they're going to do?
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.000]  What have they accomplished?
[01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:57.079]  What are they planning to do?
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.760]  Okay, wow, they accomplished almost all this.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.199]  Wow, where they want to go is really horrible.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:01.920]  They mean business.
[01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:08.520]  We better start opposing the actual controllers and cut to the chase and say, here's where these folks are taking you.
[01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:30.479]  And instead of us having a human revolution of ideas against them and taking society back peacefully, they want to get us all fighting with each other, with the CIA and these sociologists and anthropologists and psychologists looking at each group and country and region and getting us all,
[01:37:30.579 --> 01:37:36.659]  according to our backgrounds, to fight with each other so they can rule over us.
[01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:46.560]  And they want the president to own our bodies and give us poison shots and kill a bunch of people and get away with it to set the precedent for even bigger attacks, but they're not getting away with it?
[01:37:46.739 --> 01:37:48.100]  Bill Gates and others are being indicted?
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.619]  They are testing all of this out and then accelerating it.
[01:37:56.079 --> 01:38:02.119]  So the world gets dystopic and horrible by the minute if you don't push back.
[01:38:02.539 --> 01:38:04.739]  You don't push back because you're a hero.
[01:38:04.739 --> 01:38:07.260]  You don't push back because you're Superman.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.359]  You push back because you're under attack.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.699]  And bowing down is not where you want to be.
[01:38:14.119 --> 01:38:16.140]  These aren't people that just want to conquer you.
[01:38:16.279 --> 01:38:20.119]  And you can bow down and they'll give you a job as long as you tip the hat.
[01:38:20.359 --> 01:38:21.800]  No, they want you off the planet.
[01:38:21.899 --> 01:38:22.720]  They want you dead.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.859]  They want all this future technology for themselves and not you.
[01:38:28.039 --> 01:38:28.479]  Immortality.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:37.100]  Whether you believe in that or not, their open cult, Ray Kurzweil, Yuval Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, watch their events, read their books, it's all.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.720]  We will soon be able to live forever.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.479]  The general public can't have this.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.159]  We need to get rid of almost everybody.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.279]  Genocide.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:52.800]  But scientifically done through the water, the food, the culture, the drugs.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:55.960]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.300]  It's going on all around you.
[01:38:58.079 --> 01:39:05.319]  And if you won't wake up to the enclosure being built around you, and you just accept that enclosure that's a kill grid, you're done.
[01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:09.399]  So you have to wake up like the judge has.
[01:39:09.579 --> 01:39:16.100]  He excoriated them again today and said, without a full hearing, you say you own his name?
[01:39:16.579 --> 01:39:20.439]  Well, I'm going to need to have full briefings most of the day on this.
[01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:21.640]  Wow, this is something new.
[01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:35.609]  You think you're going to come in here and you're going to say you own someone's name and you don't want to even have a hearing?
[01:39:35.609 --> 01:39:37.109]  I understand why you don't want to have a hearing.
[01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:40.310]  Well, Your Honor, we won't be ready by November 1st.
[01:39:40.369 --> 01:39:40.810]  Well, you're not.
[01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:43.369]  Well, why did you think you could own his name then?
[01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:45.050]  Because they can't.
[01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:48.550]  But he's Alex Jones.
[01:39:50.810 --> 01:40:00.479]  The last time the last federal trustee got up on the stand and the judge fired him on the stand, Pat McGill, the judge said, why do you think you could just seize his company and close the doors?
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.439]  And he goes, he had guns, sir.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:06.140]  The judge goes, was there an issue with the guns?
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.399]  He goes, well, just there was an issue.
[01:40:07.479 --> 01:40:07.939]  Well, what was it?
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.920]  Well, I can't get into it.
[01:40:10.859 --> 01:40:11.800]  There was a report.
[01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:12.479]  What was the report?
[01:40:12.579 --> 01:40:14.300]  I can't, I don't know what the report was.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:16.020]  Judge, what, you're fired.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.420]  There's guns?
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.840]  So you sent men with guns without...
[01:40:23.829 --> 01:40:30.329]  A judge's order or a warrant or anything without a court order because there were guns.
[01:40:30.989 --> 01:40:33.210]  But you can't tell us what we were doing wrong with the guns.
[01:40:33.329 --> 01:40:34.630]  And you're like, that doesn't make sense.
[01:40:35.069 --> 01:40:42.229]  Does saying Trump's Hitler because he's going to do a rally at the same place American Nazis did 84 years ago?
[01:40:42.729 --> 01:40:44.010]  85 years ago?
[01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:47.630]  Does that make sense to you?
[01:40:48.050 --> 01:40:48.850]  Madison Square Garden?
[01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.949]  And the judge literally said, make it make sense to me.
[01:40:56.109 --> 01:41:02.409]  And see, no one's really come to my aid, talk show host-wise, because they're just like, it doesn't even sound real.
[01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:05.409]  They're like, come on, yeah, yeah, Alex, come on.
[01:41:05.569 --> 01:41:06.569]  Nobody's getting your name.
[01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:08.470]  They're trying.
[01:41:09.729 --> 01:41:12.109]  And I'm up here telling listeners, hey, I really need some support.
[01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:17.289]  I want to be able to have a new operation, new studio, new, you know, money for the crew.
[01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:23.130]  And I gotta fight all these Democrat lawsuits, and we finally learned how they're operating.
[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:24.630]  We're getting into courts where we're beating them.
[01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:25.970]  I really need your help.
[01:41:26.029 --> 01:41:27.050]  It's like, ah, come on, Alex.
[01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.970]  Yeah, come on.
[01:41:29.869 --> 01:41:37.010]  So, that's where we are, and I told you, and now there it is, and I need your support.
[01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:45.310]  So, there is a giant sale that the sponsors come up with at thealexjonesstore.com that is a loss leader on some of the products.
[01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:51.850]  When I heard 20% off, I'm like, we're already 55% off on combo deals.
[01:41:52.489 --> 01:41:54.750]  And there's not that much markup in there.
[01:41:54.949 --> 01:41:56.529]  I mean, we're making like 20%, 30%.
[01:41:56.529 --> 01:42:01.430]  When it's 50% off, I'm like, okay.
[01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:13.210]  So, it's now 20% off at checkout automatically at thealexandstore.com with starting at 40% off for the supplements for one bottle, 50 for two.
[01:42:14.399 --> 01:42:15.619]  55 for three.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.819]  So that's 75% off.
[01:42:17.939 --> 01:42:18.760]  That loses money.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:19.720]  Okay.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:20.739]  They're the sponsor.
[01:42:20.899 --> 01:42:21.079]  Great.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:21.800]  They want to do that?
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.039]  Boom.
[01:42:22.119 --> 01:42:22.539]  There you go.
[01:42:23.739 --> 01:42:25.659]  But we do need to get funds in here.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.319]  The t-shirts are marked up.
[01:42:31.359 --> 01:42:32.039]  About 100%.
[01:42:32.039 --> 01:42:33.979]  So they cost like 15 bucks to make a t-shirt.
[01:42:34.579 --> 01:42:35.520]  I sell them for 30.
[01:42:35.699 --> 01:42:36.739]  That's 100% right there.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.279]  That's why we came up with it.
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:42.520]  I told them, hey, can I have a few fundraiser shirts like the navy blue with the red on it with InfoWars?
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.020]  It's 50.
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.680]  So we get some real money in here to pay for all this?
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.140]  They said, sure.
[01:42:47.479 --> 01:42:49.119]  So the InfoWars with the red...
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.340]  M4's logo on Navy Blue, that's 50.
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.239]  There's the Punisher, Rebellion to Tyrants, Obedience to God shirt, that's 50.
[01:42:56.359 --> 01:42:59.359]  But those are 20% off, too, at checkout as well.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.020]  So I'm not bitching about the sale.
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.760]  I'm just saying, you know, you can have sales so good, we're homeless.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.380]  So, wow, that's quite the sales pitch, isn't it?
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:13.079]  Yeah, you're getting a loss leader when you get the triple packs.
[01:43:13.479 --> 01:43:16.640]  We're basically making no money on the double packs.
[01:43:17.529 --> 01:43:21.609]  On the two, and then we make little money on the one supplement when you buy one.
[01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:27.149]  So the Ultimate CMOS Capsules, Incredible Superfood, Probiotics, $60 billion.
[01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:32.010]  There's also the Gut Cleanse that goes with it that's amazing.
[01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:35.350]  And I guess I forgot to bring that over here.
[01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:37.390]  Will you guys bring me the Hydroforce over there off the table?
[01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:41.289]  The Hydroforce, by the way, is advertised as a...
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:43.760]  Electrolyte.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.300]  But we need to rename it because it's probably a top-selling brand.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:50.619]  It's full of vitamins, full of minerals, all this other super goody stuff.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.659]  It's a pre-workout, post-workout, delicious fruit punch, over-the-top incredible.
[01:43:56.239 --> 01:44:00.380]  I mean, it needs to be like vitamin, mineral, ultimate hydroforce.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.979]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:08.239]  And you can get it for 75% off when you get three canisters.
[01:44:11.539 --> 01:44:16.060]  I mean, you can get this for less than it cost us at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:21.880]  So, if that isn't one hell of a deal for you, I don't know what is.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.079]  And I don't know how long they're going to run that, because it doesn't make sense.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:32.579]  So, because I know, because we get a percentage of it, and we need money to fight the globalists and fund this operation.
[01:44:32.579 --> 01:44:34.340]  So, go get the t-shirts.
[01:44:36.569 --> 01:44:38.170]  Any of the t-shirts will get us some funding.
[01:44:38.289 --> 01:44:38.789]  They're all great.
[01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:41.170]  New designs getting added every few days, sometimes every day.
[01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:44.369]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:44:45.489 --> 01:45:01.250]  And by the way, it's what, five days till the super badass Dodge truck, $136,000 value, $10,000 cash raffle, sweepstakes, and everybody that buys products gets entered a whole bunch of times to be the winner.
[01:45:01.489 --> 01:45:05.000]  And there's a bunch of other stuff, but Maybe we have Armageddon.
[01:45:05.079 --> 01:45:05.920]  It'll be good to have this truck.
[01:45:06.079 --> 01:45:08.899]  But the point is, is that's another little fun thing on top of it.
[01:45:08.939 --> 01:45:18.979]  But quite frankly, dispensing with all the fun stuff, I'm taking the New World Order on point-blank range, swinging for the fences, everything I've got, so pissed off, I'm breaking blood vessels in my eye.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:25.359]  And I want to win, and I know you want to win, and we are literally riding the response to the globalists.
[01:45:25.439 --> 01:45:32.039]  We're the first nine times out of ten to actually get ahead of the operation because nobody else has the courage to do it, I guess, with a big show.
[01:45:33.239 --> 01:45:35.159]  I'm trying to get everybody to talk about it so we beat them.
[01:45:35.319 --> 01:45:37.460]  I don't want to be the guy that's got the answers.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.359]  My God, it's so damn simple.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.720]  It's right there in front of your face.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.100]  And I need money.
[01:45:43.779 --> 01:45:46.579]  I don't have George Soros and the New World Order in front of me.
[01:45:46.619 --> 01:45:47.300]  I got you.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.199]  And these are incredible products.
[01:45:50.439 --> 01:45:53.420]  Separately, my dad's a big sponsor of whatever comes after Infowars.
[01:45:53.539 --> 01:45:54.579]  Because I'm up against the deep state.
[01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:58.369]  And so, he's got DrZonesNaturals.com.
[01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:01.350]  Next Level Foundational Energy is proprietary, is insane.
[01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:03.170]  Gives you great energy with no letdown.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:08.899]  And there's the nano-silver fluoride-free toothpaste Super Blue back in stock, limited supply.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:11.520]  And all the other great supplements like Cabochill.
[01:46:11.739 --> 01:46:15.020]  It isn't a depressant, but relaxes you with clean focus.
[01:46:15.359 --> 01:46:15.899]  It's amazing.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.020]  An incredible natural sleep aid.
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.039]  Bunch of concentrated known herbs that do it.
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.220]  That's rocket rest.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:22.539]  You want a nootropic stimulant?
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.279]  Oh, we got one.
[01:46:23.359 --> 01:46:23.899]  It's powerful.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:25.180]  Top brain.
[01:46:25.399 --> 01:46:28.640]  All this and more at drjoesnaturals.com.
[01:46:28.979 --> 01:46:31.159]  Well, the second American revolution's happening right in front of you.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.859]  Are you going to back the Rebels, especially when we're starting to win?
[01:46:35.039 --> 01:46:37.079]  Or are you going to roll over?
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:38.520]  I ask for your prayer.
[01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:39.680]  I ask for your word of mouth.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.979]  And I ask for your support now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:46:43.399 --> 01:46:44.399]  You see it everywhere.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:45.699]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:45.819 --> 01:46:46.939]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[01:46:47.909 --> 01:46:55.810]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[01:46:56.449 --> 01:47:04.430]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games, and I've been accurate about 98% of the time, and I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:05.590]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:06.250]  I've made mistakes.
[01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:14.390]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[01:47:14.729 --> 01:47:18.630]  And we're reaching tens of billions of new people every day.
[01:47:18.829 --> 01:47:20.289]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:47:20.949 --> 01:47:23.149]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.590]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:28.390]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:36.569]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:39.279]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[01:47:39.439 --> 01:47:49.020]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed, there's been backup systems set up and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[01:47:49.159 --> 01:47:53.439]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[01:47:53.479 --> 01:47:57.619]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:48:00.180]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[01:48:00.319 --> 01:48:02.000]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[01:48:02.819 --> 01:48:08.479]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, DrZonesNaturals.com.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:20.060]  And it's got a lot of the classic supplements I've promoted for years, but also a lot of new proprietary ones and other top products private labeled by my dad who will always back me as long as he gets the support.
[01:48:20.529 --> 01:48:36.550]  So please visit drjonesnaturals.com, the best toothpaste out there, fluoride-free, fortified with nano-silver, iodine, does incredible things in the mouth, tea tree, peppermint, organic, concentrated, it's amazing, super blue toothpaste,
[01:48:36.789 --> 01:48:40.090]  now back in stock, limited supply, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:46.060]  Then, there's a product you absolutely must get that's been sold out for a while, limited supply back in stock.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.319]  Next level, foundational energy.
[01:48:48.539 --> 01:48:50.800]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:53.960]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:49:04.460]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like organic B-complex.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.939]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[01:49:12.119 --> 01:49:13.100]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:18.260]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[01:49:18.659 --> 01:49:19.920]  But everybody feels it.
[01:49:20.039 --> 01:49:24.760]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.279]  A lot of people do.
[01:49:25.479 --> 01:49:29.539]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[01:49:30.369 --> 01:49:34.170]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[01:49:34.449 --> 01:49:37.170]  You want to experience next level of foundational energy.
[01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:41.170]  Just like our information, it's absolutely amazing, and I know you're going to want to order it again.
[01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:46.029]  We have something like an 85% reorder rate, my dad does, on this product.
[01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:47.289]  People love it.
[01:49:47.909 --> 01:49:49.310]  So, limited supply came back in.
[01:49:49.409 --> 01:49:53.409]  Get your next level of financial energy now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:57.350]  There's also the natural sleep aid that works really good, even if you don't have trouble sleeping.
[01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:00.010]  It makes it deeper, more restful, so good for your immune system.
[01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:01.449]  Try Rocket Rest.
[01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:05.590]  If you want a stimulant that's all natural and really works well, well, that's top.
[01:50:05.670 --> 01:50:07.350]  It's not brain, ladies and gentlemen, and it's strong.
[01:50:07.489 --> 01:50:08.609]  People are blown away by it.
[01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:10.750]  They're like, wow, this is something else.
[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:12.130]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:16.970]  And then, of course, there's a good, high-quality, staple, organic base, so it's not synthetic.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:20.590]  Whole food, concentrate, multivitamin, good basis.
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.000]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:24.279]  Foundation for everything you're doing?
[01:50:24.359 --> 01:50:25.159]  That's a good staple.
[01:50:25.399 --> 01:50:30.319]  If you're looking for high-quality multivitamin, it's a private label of a very top, high-rated one that's got five stars.
[01:50:30.699 --> 01:50:37.239]  And so many other great products, like the concentrated seed sprouts that are so good for your gut, so good for your body.
[01:50:37.479 --> 01:50:38.819]  Just some of the sprouts are...
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:48.340]  We're good to go.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:06.420]  You want to keep us on the air and your great products at the same time, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:51:06.739 --> 01:51:09.039]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, we can't do this without you.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.560]  If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:15.340]  But that's not happening.
[01:51:15.539 --> 01:51:20.560]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[01:51:20.859 --> 01:51:23.279]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.479]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.
[01:51:25.619 --> 01:51:27.539]  I want you to see how great these products are.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.319]  My dad does.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.060]  I need to sponsor into the future.
[01:51:30.199 --> 01:51:34.739]  So I want you to get high-quality products that really work so you come back again and again.
[01:51:34.819 --> 01:51:37.680]  Like a restaurant that serves really good, healthy, high-quality, delicious food.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.979]  I want the line around the block.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.180]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.600]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[01:51:43.119 --> 01:51:45.279]  So, you gotta try it to see how great it is.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.699]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:51:46.819 --> 01:51:50.199]  And separately, our other big sponsor is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:51:50.619 --> 01:51:55.779]  They will continue to make sure we stay on the air with t-shirts, with other high-quality supplements, with ball caps, with hoodies.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.220]  There's some amazing designs.
[01:51:57.539 --> 01:51:59.779]  Some of the shirts are $20, $25, $30.
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:03.739]  But there are two shirts, the classic InfoWars red on navy blue.
[01:52:05.110 --> 01:52:15.689]  And a rebellion to tyrants shirt that are both $50 that have extra markup in them if you really want to support us being sure we have the funds we need to go in the future.
[01:52:15.949 --> 01:52:18.630]  And on my children, we are behind on funds.
[01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:24.329]  I haven't been defeated yet because you've been backing me, but we are so close right now.
[01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:33.850]  And so I'm here asking for your support and asking you humbly to take action now and get great products at thealexjonesstore.com as well as drjonesdadryls.com.
[01:52:33.989 --> 01:52:39.029]  And there's a bunch of specials at thealexjonesstore.com that are running right now.

[01:53:26.029 --> 01:53:27.069]  And I see you doing it.
[01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:28.310]  You understand the urgency.
[01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:29.430]  So I salute you.
[01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:32.630]  So for myself and the whole crew, thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[01:53:32.890 --> 01:53:33.770]  Thanks for coming through.

[01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:38.649]  And I humbly and respectfully thank you.
[01:53:39.689 --> 01:53:41.470]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:45.329]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.
[01:53:45.489 --> 01:53:47.770]  And our great sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:53.090]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[01:53:53.449 --> 01:53:55.069]  Because I hadn't really...
[01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:56.409]  There's other folks on this.
[01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:57.630]  Other folks that are great run this.
[01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:58.329]  The folks at Bigly.
[01:53:58.670 --> 01:53:59.789]  Great Patriot backers.
[01:53:59.869 --> 01:54:00.470]  Total Patriots.
[01:54:00.529 --> 01:54:00.989]  J-Sexers.
[01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.470]  You name it.
[01:54:02.539 --> 01:54:04.720]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.659]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[01:54:09.279 --> 01:54:19.479]  So, if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[01:54:19.899 --> 01:54:22.100]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[01:54:22.739 --> 01:54:26.739]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.

[01:54:37.619 --> 01:54:38.619]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.079]  That's right.
[01:54:39.319 --> 01:54:42.760]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:47.079]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.

[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:59.020]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:02.939]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.

[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.100]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced the 30th this month.
[01:55:15.479 --> 01:55:16.100]  You want to win?
[01:55:16.319 --> 01:55:17.260]  I know you do.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.000]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:22.640]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[01:55:23.119 --> 01:55:24.880]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[01:55:25.199 --> 01:55:26.779]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.380]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.119]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[01:55:32.449 --> 01:55:34.909]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:40.189]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.

[01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:43.649]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.890]  Pre-shipping.
[01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:48.050]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:49.449]  It just goes on from there.
[01:55:49.989 --> 01:55:56.569]  So, theallogshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallogshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:55:56.939 --> 01:55:58.899]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:55:59.079 --> 01:56:00.779]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.500]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.920]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:14.939]  theallowshowstore.com It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:24.239]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:56:24.479 --> 01:56:31.500]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.659]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:56:34.159 --> 01:56:36.600]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:56:37.039 --> 01:56:37.819]  We've already...
[01:56:38.699 --> 01:56:39.800]  Just devastated them.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.960]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:56:43.199 --> 01:56:44.539]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:48.840]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:59.479]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:56:59.699 --> 01:57:01.279]  So again, I don't give up.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:04.180]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:07.810]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[01:57:08.050 --> 01:57:10.270]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.750]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:20.449]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor, to dictate total control over the social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:25.430]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:28.810]  And are we gonna sell out our species like this?
[01:57:30.439 --> 01:57:32.680]  I mean, it's just, this is a joke.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:34.140]  This is ridiculous.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:35.680]  We're changing the world.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:38.680]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[01:57:39.359 --> 01:57:42.279]  Wear a Trump t-shirt, put a sign on the loan, wear a mega hat, you know?
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.859]  And then if people confront you, say, yeah, that's right.
[01:57:45.239 --> 01:57:47.319]  Elon Musk is absolutely right.
[01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:56.560]  We need to show our support for President Trump as a champion against the globalists, as the champion, by wearing his shirts out in public and not being ashamed.
[01:57:57.170 --> 01:58:01.510]  Because the majority of Americans, the number of shows, support Trump, but they're still scared to say it.
[01:58:01.869 --> 01:58:04.670]  You will meet so many like-minded people when you wear President Trump shirts.
[01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:06.630]  We've got some great ones at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:58:07.329 --> 01:58:12.130]  But Infowars shirts are recognized by patriots and tyrants alike.
[01:58:12.609 --> 01:58:18.569]  As the symbol of the resistance, old school, true rebels, true mavericks against tyranny.
[01:58:18.989 --> 01:58:24.630]  Now when you go to thealexjonesstore.com, there's amazing hoodies, ball caps, new designs getting out every few days, amazing t-shirts.
[01:58:25.029 --> 01:58:32.750]  But two of the shirts are marked up a little more than $25, $30 or so, so that you can really know you helped fundraise.
[01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:40.689]  And it's the classic InfoWars red on navy blue, and it is the Punisher shirt right here that everybody really loves.
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.000]  Because it's true.
[01:58:42.479 --> 01:58:46.279]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God, 1776.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.619]  So both of these shirts are our bestsellers.
[01:58:48.699 --> 01:58:49.960]  I want to thank those of you that are supported.
[01:58:50.199 --> 01:58:55.619]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't supported to get them both at thealexjonesstore.com right now at this critical time.
[01:58:55.979 --> 01:59:04.380]  InfoWars can be shut down in just 21 days as the time I'm taping this, but your support of our sponsor will keep me on the air one way or another.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.539]  But it takes funds to get all that set up, and it's happening right now.
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:09.079]  So now is the time of action.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:12.180]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get both these amazing shirts.
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:21.619]  Again, the Rebellion to Tyrants' Obedience to God's shirt is one of the special fundraisers and so is this classic M4. Notice this is an XXL. It's baggy now.
[01:59:21.699 --> 01:59:25.100]  In just the last few months, I've been taking the Ultimate CMOS and it's helped me lose all this weight.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:29.140]  Find that as well and help keep us on there one way or another at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:29.939]  Thanks for your support.
[01:59:38.829 --> 01:59:41.369]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydro Force.
[01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:45.109]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:53.369]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[01:59:53.449 --> 01:59:58.850]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:14.789]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[02:00:15.409 --> 02:00:16.210]  and more.
[02:00:16.529 --> 02:00:18.130]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:24.050]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[02:00:24.210 --> 02:00:29.550]  And then it funds my broadcast, And the crew and all of us continuing on.
[02:00:29.710 --> 02:00:33.010]  So we need your support if InfoWars shuts down November 13th to continue on.
[02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:37.270]  Regardless, it's gonna help us up our game if InfoWars survives.
[02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:45.970]  So please, go check out this amazing supplement, the highest quality you're gonna find, with big discounts and other great supplements at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:58.409]  We sought out The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[02:00:58.649 --> 02:01:02.689]  And we found a top company with top reviews that would let us private label it.
[02:01:02.909 --> 02:01:05.350]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[02:01:05.670 --> 02:01:08.130]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:09.789]  It's a super food.
[02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:10.689]  It's a pre-workout.
[02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:11.649]  It's a post-workout.
[02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:15.430]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:25.399]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydroforce.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:32.279]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.600]  This baby is next level.
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:40.560]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:51.659]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:54.140]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:55.579]  So there's a line out the door.
[02:01:55.899 --> 02:02:04.060]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:05.659]  And why is that?
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.359]  Well, it's simple.
[02:02:06.439 --> 02:02:10.319]  This is called Ultimate Hydroforce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[02:02:10.819 --> 02:02:14.579]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, re-workout.
[02:02:14.779 --> 02:02:18.380]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you say.
[02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:25.020]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[02:02:25.359 --> 02:02:28.340]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:40.680]  All right, I set this up a month ago, but it's perfect.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.079]  He's here today.
[02:02:42.659 --> 02:02:44.680]  Brigham Bueller is an amazing guy.
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:49.359]  And he's also one of Joe Rogan's most popular guests and really good friends with him here in Austin.
[02:02:49.939 --> 02:02:52.079]  And he is quite the Renaissance man.
[02:02:52.359 --> 02:02:57.560]  And when I've gotten to know him and talked to him and the links he sends me, I said, you got to get on the show.
[02:02:58.189 --> 02:03:00.170]  And he said a while back, okay, sometime I'll come on.
[02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:01.829]  Well, he hit me up a few weeks ago and said, I'm ready.
[02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:03.710]  You'll come in on this Friday.
[02:03:03.949 --> 02:03:12.029]  Who knew that Trump would be here, about to speak at the airport, then drive over to the studios, Joe's studio is very close to here, and do this huge interview.
[02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:13.069]  Kamala chickened out.
[02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:19.569]  Even though she's barnstorming Texas all over the place, he's scared to go on, but just basically wouldn't ever agree on the time.
[02:03:20.029 --> 02:03:20.970]  So just amazing.
[02:03:21.210 --> 02:03:23.189]  But I also wanted to talk about you because...
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.920]  You're a seasoned healthcare thought leader, big industry whistleblower, and founder of longevity healthcare company Ways to Well.
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:34.439]  You just got done testifying to Congress, got some of that amazing video.
[02:03:34.899 --> 02:03:40.579]  Over 15 years of experience in business, including previously working at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:43.819]  Brigham has firsthand insight into the medical industry's corruption.
[02:03:44.119 --> 02:03:47.199]  He is a credible leading voice against the corrupt world.
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:59.500]  I think?
[02:04:08.489 --> 02:04:10.670]  We always ask guests to send us any clips or documents.
[02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:14.869]  He sent us a ton of amazing stuff here.
[02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:20.050]  And over the next two hours, we're going to go over a lot of this and play these clips.
[02:04:20.170 --> 02:04:28.130]  It's perfect timing with Bill Gates getting indicted in the Netherlands for all the harm that he pushed with the poison shots that he's a big benefactor of.
[02:04:28.670 --> 02:04:30.390]  And him trying to be our medical doctor.
[02:04:31.450 --> 02:04:33.649]  I mean, there's a huge awakening happening.
[02:04:33.789 --> 02:04:44.470]  So I want to get into Trump, the election, the world, the things you've witnessed, all the things you did in Big Pharma, how the scam works with these corrupt editors taking over medicine, how there's a revolution against it.
[02:04:44.649 --> 02:04:45.510]  We talk so much.
[02:04:45.569 --> 02:04:47.310]  I'm kind of repeating what you've said to me, and I agree with it all.
[02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:49.229]  And then all the amazing stuff.
[02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:53.670]  It's so informative on Rogan's podcast and others.
[02:04:53.789 --> 02:04:59.189]  But you really are Rogan's favorite health guy, and Rogan really knows a lot more about it than even I do.
[02:04:59.789 --> 02:05:13.670]  So just up front, tell us about yourself and your process of life and then your particular way of seeing things that I think is just dead on and then quantify what you think is happening today in the world and we can just get into it all.
[02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:15.210]  Yeah, no, I love it.
[02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:19.029]  And thank you for the kind words in the introduction and for the opportunity to come on here.
[02:05:19.130 --> 02:05:19.949]  I really appreciate it.
[02:05:21.289 --> 02:05:23.930]  My experience started as a pharmaceutical rep.
[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:25.649]  You know, I was part of the dark side.
[02:05:25.829 --> 02:05:33.649]  I didn't realize that, but right out of college, I had the opportunity to go work for what I thought was going to be an amazing company in Eli Lilly.
[02:05:34.289 --> 02:06:04.649]  They were recognized as one of the most ethical companies in pharmaceuticals at the time, which is, you know, that's a I guess a up for debate because that entire sector is pretty rigged against the American people and that's what I rapidly learned being in that space was you know there is a lot of I guess hidden agendas and a lot of times that products are being pushed and grown in a marketplace that are probably bigger than
[02:06:04.670 --> 02:06:06.430]  Better utilization than they should be.
[02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:15.970]  But after doing that, I went into MedDevice where I was in the surgical space, worked with some of the best and brightest minds in surgery, saw what was going on in our hospital systems.
[02:06:16.449 --> 02:06:22.409]  From there, I was a serial entrepreneur where I opened labs and pharmacies that attempted to work within the insurance model.
[02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:40.329]  And that's where I was first exposed to the corruption of the big insurance companies and just started looking to try and find a better way, a better way to help Patients escape the sick care system and transition into true healthcare, which for me is being proactive,
[02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:42.930]  predictive, and trying to prevent chronic disease.
[02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:48.430]  But the main point of my talk track and what I talk to people about is the system isn't broken.
[02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:50.029]  And this is what I told our Senate.
[02:06:50.289 --> 02:06:52.590]  The system isn't broken, the system is rigged.
[02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:54.890]  And the American people are the ones fitting the bill.
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:02.300]  The bottom line is that this system is monetizing chronic disease, and the incentives are all wrong.
[02:07:02.899 --> 02:07:05.100]  There is no money in curing diseases.
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:09.960]  The money comes in monetizing the disease state and treating the symptoms.
[02:07:11.239 --> 02:07:13.260]  And what you just said is the key.
[02:07:13.399 --> 02:07:20.180]  I have so many guests on, including really smart congresspeople, and Trump does it, and everybody does it.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.579]  And they go, you know, they're really dumb.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:23.840]  They're mismanaging.
[02:07:24.159 --> 02:07:25.399]  We need to fix it.
[02:07:25.579 --> 02:07:27.159]  No, it's planned this way.
[02:07:27.319 --> 02:07:31.619]  The documents have come out across the industries, insurance, big pharma, the big hospitals.
[02:07:32.199 --> 02:07:39.840]  And it's extremely predatory, and it's getting more predatory, and it's getting rid of any control people have, patients have, doctors or nurses or nurse practitioners.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.579]  And you do a great job explaining that.
[02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:47.569]  Yeah, if we look at it and we, if you, anybody can look at this and say something's not right.
[02:07:47.989 --> 02:07:51.310]  Every major chronic disease is at an all-time high.
[02:07:51.729 --> 02:07:53.810]  Deaths of despair are at an all-time high.
[02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:55.649]  Greater than that of the Great Depression.
[02:07:56.050 --> 02:07:59.229]  More people are committing suicide than during the Great Depression.
[02:08:00.879 --> 02:08:06.600]  Alzheimer's, diabetes, metabolic disease, cancer, all of them are at all-time highs.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:12.340]  Meanwhile, the US government is spending more on healthcare than it ever has in the history of our nation.
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:15.260]  We spend more than any other nation on our healthcare.
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:32.199]  And as we work through the layers of this system, what you'll find, and I brought this up too to the Senate, in Eisenhower's speech, So often people talk about the amazing exit speech that Eisenhower had where he warned us about the military industrial complex.
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.539]  But many times people overlook the second half of that speech.
[02:08:36.899 --> 02:08:42.960]  And in the second half of Eisenhower's speech, he warned us about the scientific industrial complex.
[02:08:43.239 --> 02:08:55.119]  And that if we allow corporate interests and corporate capture of our science and innovation We will stifle innovation and monetize and control the scientific messaging.
[02:08:55.439 --> 02:09:04.859]  He said something to the nature of, we will lose the garage tinkerer, the creator, and everything will be monetized and sold, and that's where we're at.
[02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:19.229]  From our food systems, to our medical systems, to our treatment modalities, whether we're talking big pharma, big insurance, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital systems, it's all been captured by special interest.
[02:09:19.409 --> 02:09:22.470]  And I can methodically walk your listeners through that and explain how.
[02:09:22.930 --> 02:09:23.789]  Yeah, please start...
[02:09:24.329 --> 02:09:24.869]  Doing that.
[02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:28.350]  And then I want to get into Trump and the campaign and the whole world.
[02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:30.270]  We'll recap what's happened with the deep state.
[02:09:30.369 --> 02:09:31.130]  But I've talked to you a lot.
[02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:36.409]  I mean, whatever the subject, we're basically, I totally agree with you, but you say it in ways even better than I do.
[02:09:36.729 --> 02:09:38.029]  Plus, you've been a witness to it.
[02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.270]  Yeah.
[02:09:38.489 --> 02:09:40.670]  And it's really important to expose that.
[02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:48.869]  Yeah, so one of the examples I can give, so often, so let's just get into why we believe in proactive predictive medicine.
[02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:57.369]  Everyone can agree that if we could prevent cancer, why would we want to focus on treatments for cancer, right?
[02:09:57.449 --> 02:10:01.369]  If we can prevent diabetes, we don't have to write drugs to treat diabetes.
[02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:08.069]  And these things are possible, but it requires getting proactive and predictive, and the system's not built to do that.
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:12.239]  On average, a patient gets six minutes with a provider in this country.
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:24.199]  That's for that doctor to be able to troubleshoot family history, go over all the ailments that are bothering you, all the prescription medications you're on, which now the average American's on four or more prescription drugs.
[02:10:24.739 --> 02:10:29.180]  It's virtually impossible to be able to cover that much ground in six minutes.
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:30.180]  I mean, it is impossible.
[02:10:32.579 --> 02:10:42.279]  Then if you look and you look through the layers of this, you would say, well, if you're an insurance company, isn't there value in preventing chronic diseases?
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:45.399]  Don't these cost us more money?
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:46.720]  And the answer is yes.
[02:10:46.979 --> 02:10:54.979]  If a patient transitions from being pre-diabetic to diabetic, there is a six-fold increase in the cost of care for the rest of that patient's life.
[02:10:55.989 --> 02:11:01.470]  But when I tell you they're monetizing your chronic disease, I can walk you through how.
[02:11:01.689 --> 02:11:07.890]  So there's so many players in this, and so often we're focused on the pharmaceutical companies, and they're bad guys.
[02:11:08.050 --> 02:11:11.670]  They are bad guys, and that's abundantly clear.
[02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:19.090]  But separate from the big pharmaceutical conglomerates are the big insurance conglomerates, and they're just as sinister.
[02:11:19.329 --> 02:11:28.470]  The big insurance companies are literally making rebates or kickbacks on every prescription drug you or your loved ones take.
[02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:34.090]  And when you look up the chain, BlackRock's just the holding company with 80-plus percent of all the world assets.
[02:11:34.569 --> 02:11:36.869]  It's all the same owners of...
[02:11:37.729 --> 02:11:43.869]  Big pharma, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, big medical groups, and it's all just merging into one big blob.
[02:11:44.250 --> 02:11:45.069]  You got it.
[02:11:45.329 --> 02:11:49.869]  We broke that down on Rogan, because what was stunning to me is the...
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:12:03.220]  I think?
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:12.899]  And if you look at who owns all of these, Alex is right.
[02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:19.359]  As you break it down, the majority shareholder of every one of these companies is BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street.
[02:12:19.579 --> 02:12:21.840]  And we can go through one, one by one.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:24.100]  So I challenge people like, Google Eli Lilly.
[02:12:24.279 --> 02:12:25.800]  Look at the five biggest shareholders.
[02:12:26.079 --> 02:12:27.180]  Now look at Kellogg's.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:29.460]  Who are the big five shareholders?
[02:12:29.739 --> 02:12:33.899]  And you go through the insurance companies and you'll find the same usual suspects.
[02:12:34.649 --> 02:12:45.350]  We live in a world where you can pull a lever and spray Roundup on food and in all of our crops, and Roundup is traced to causing cancer.
[02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:50.729]  But then in the same breath, you've got Bayer, who's also owned by the same company.
[02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:53.529]  Monsanto and Bayer are one in the same.
[02:12:54.550 --> 02:13:03.640]  Bayer actually owns Monsanto, the chemical company now, and these products That are causing cancer are almost feeding the machine.
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:11.460]  And I'm not here to say that that's intentional, but when the incentives are skewed, it creates an environment that makes it hard.
[02:13:11.659 --> 02:13:12.239]  Well, I mean, come on.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:16.439]  Pfizer said three years ago, our new big growth market will be cancer.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:18.720]  We believe cancer is going to get a lot worse, which it is.
[02:13:18.979 --> 02:13:22.920]  And then you look at the COVID shots, they literally turbo cancer with a spike protein.
[02:13:23.359 --> 02:13:27.340]  So they give you something that gives you cancer, and then they give you these new drugs to treat these new cancers.
[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:28.420]  You're right.
[02:13:28.579 --> 02:13:30.779]  And then here's how they monetize it.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.699]  Because a lot of people, they know about big pharma.
[02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:34.939]  They don't know about big food.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.560]  And I'm hoping we're bringing that to light.
[02:13:36.659 --> 02:13:37.460]  Talk about it, yeah.
[02:13:37.899 --> 02:13:50.500]  Yeah, so one of the things we talked about in front of the Senate is in the United States in the 80s, there were 700 ingredients approved in our food by the FDA. There are now 10,000 ingredients approved to be in our food.
[02:13:51.079 --> 02:13:54.680]  A lot of those ingredients are banned in Europe and Canada.
[02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:59.109]  So Kellogg's makes one brand, Fruit Loops, for instance.
[02:13:59.409 --> 02:14:07.189]  They make one cereal for the American people and in the same factory make a different concoction for other nations.
[02:14:07.449 --> 02:14:13.670]  So they have the ability to sell us less harmful, less addictive, less processed foods, but they choose not to.
[02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:23.329]  And they instead push these highly addictive, highly processed foods that have an array of different food dyes and chemicals in them that are banned in other countries.
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:26.800]  And the same FDA runs around trying to stop people getting vitamins.
[02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:38.859]  So looking at that and where that's all going, with Robert F. Kennedy exposing it, Rogan exposing it, you exposing it, this is really getting out there, just going back in the back of the food for a moment.
[02:14:39.949 --> 02:14:46.670]  You mentioned Roundup, and they knew what glyphosate did day one and grows cancers and hurts fertility and does all these things.
[02:14:46.789 --> 02:14:53.149]  But the U.S. is one of the only countries in the world that allows atrazine that 100% bends genders in all major species.
[02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:58.850]  And again, they knew when they rolled it out that was going on, and then we see what's happening here.
[02:14:58.930 --> 02:15:01.789]  I mean, this is clearly a depopulation plan.
[02:15:02.479 --> 02:15:14.000]  It definitely, the facts are there and the data is overwhelming and we can look at what's happening in our nation with the level of chronic disease and we can go back to the 80s when everything changed.
[02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:18.819]  A lot of people don't know this, but all of the food industry was captured by big tobacco.
[02:15:19.369 --> 02:15:20.970]  Big tobacco was on the ropes.
[02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:24.270]  It was billions and billions of dollars being made.
[02:15:24.489 --> 02:15:26.210]  The government was cracking down.
[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:28.350]  They were looking for new revenue streams.
[02:15:28.789 --> 02:15:33.050]  And the big tobacco conglomerates went out and purchased most of big food.
[02:15:33.289 --> 02:15:39.189]  And during the 80s, the big tobacco companies are who helped push forward the food pyramid.
[02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:43.449]  Which we know today is one of the biggest lies ever told to the American people.
[02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:53.170]  And if you look at the chronic disease and the rocket ship of rise in chronic disease from the 80s to today, and you begin to say, what happened?
[02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:55.170]  The answer is, our food changed.
[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:56.710]  Who owned our food changed.
[02:15:56.829 --> 02:15:58.670]  Who owned the food process changed.
[02:15:58.930 --> 02:16:14.609]  And then in addition to that, the pharmacy benefit managers who were supposed to be middlemen that were brought in and created to drive down the cost of prescription drugs for the average American to make it affordable so we can afford these drugs for our grandmas, our grandpas, our loved ones.
[02:16:14.789 --> 02:16:17.050]  Instead, they were captured by who?
[02:16:17.289 --> 02:16:19.250]  The big pharmaceutical...
[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:36.280]  We're good to go.
[02:16:39.959 --> 02:16:40.799]  It pivoted.
[02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:45.239]  And they began to negotiate up the price of your prescription drugs.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:47.319]  And you ask yourself, that makes no sense.
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:50.399]  Why would an insurance company negotiate up the price?
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:55.760]  Because the insurance company gets a rebate off of that increased price point.
[02:16:55.899 --> 02:16:57.540]  So think of it as a shell game.
[02:16:58.159 --> 02:17:05.659]  United Healthcare says, Alex, your prescription drugs cost us $1,000 a month to provide you with this care.
[02:17:05.899 --> 02:17:13.100]  But the truth is, they got a $500 rebate to a holding company off of those prescription drugs, so it really only cost them $500.
[02:17:13.739 --> 02:17:24.239]  But at the end of the year, they meet with your employer, and they roll out those additional charges to your employer at the $1,000 a month threshold, even though they never paid that.
[02:17:24.459 --> 02:17:36.459]  And now they're getting more arrogant and say, I remember Bill Gates and Fauci did symposiums on C-SPAN a couple years, several times before they rolled out COVID and that whole business model with the fear and the poison shots.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:47.479]  And they said, we're getting ready with a new virus out of China, something like bird flu, to blow up the old FDA system where we just direct do whatever we want on the public and we're going to bring out this mRNA and a bunch of other stuff.
[02:17:47.579 --> 02:17:48.000]  And then they...
[02:17:49.670 --> 02:18:01.389]  Once they rolled out COVID, they had their top people on TV, I played the clip 100 times, say, you know, by the third mRNA shot, it basically turns off your white blood cells, so you'll have no immune system.
[02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:02.610]  We're going to sell you drugs for that.
[02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:04.270]  So this is a great business model.
[02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:12.610]  Then James O'Keefe gets the undercover footage, we'll be still at Veritas, of the head of their mRNA project saying, oh, we're creating new viruses in labs.
[02:18:12.969 --> 02:18:14.350]  This is the new business model.
[02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:15.489]  We're taking over with mRNA.
[02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:19.430]  And people didn't believe that was really the head of Pfizer's mRNA division.
[02:18:19.530 --> 02:18:20.309]  It turned out he was.
[02:18:20.590 --> 02:18:30.629]  So, I mean, the diabolical nature of this and the fact that they're now taking over all of society and they want to use the viruses they create in the fear to lock us down.
[02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:32.590]  And they say, oh, that's good to stop the carbon.
[02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:35.010]  They're literally trying to make us pure prisoners.
[02:18:35.170 --> 02:18:36.090]  They're going for broke.
[02:18:37.299 --> 02:18:44.399]  What I've seen behind the curtain is there's more money in masking the symptoms of chronic disease than curing chronic disease.
[02:18:44.639 --> 02:18:56.219]  And so, you know, as a drug rep, one of the things I witnessed was as a drug begins to get closer to the patent expiring, they will attempt to get new classifications on an existing molecule.
[02:18:56.459 --> 02:19:06.649]  So most of the products, when they say we reinvest in innovation, Big Pharma is spending $7 billion a year in advertising.
[02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:16.790]  70%, they spend astronomically more on marketing and branding and brainwashing the American people than they do on innovation and creating.
[02:19:17.309 --> 02:19:29.879]  And typically, it's this shell game where as a product begins to reach its lifecycle patent, they will re- File for a new patent or make a slight variation in the compound to be able to extend the patent.
[02:19:30.139 --> 02:19:35.780]  One example that you will realize that this happened with is a little drug by the name of OxyContin.
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.780]  The cotton system was originally patented with hydrocodone.
[02:19:41.129 --> 02:19:50.989]  And so this was a pain medicine meant to be indicated for severely ill cancer patients who were battling chronic pain and on their deathbed in reality.
[02:19:51.290 --> 02:20:04.040]  And what happened is that patent was expiring and so at the time We're good to go.
[02:20:25.899 --> 02:20:28.459]  A label that said non-abusive.
[02:20:28.799 --> 02:20:29.020]  Wow.
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:35.020]  It was the golden ticket to print money at the detriment of the American people.
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:38.459]  And so they're shifting into pure predatory activity now.
[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:42.340]  They're totally arrogant, but there is a huge backlash now.
[02:20:42.399 --> 02:20:42.879]  Do you agree with that?
[02:20:43.579 --> 02:20:44.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:45.059]  Absolutely.
[02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:48.620]  But what worries me about even the backlash, there...
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:57.500]  I heard that they're going back after the family now for the criminal side, but they had indemnified the family, I think, five years ago based off fines.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:07.799]  But what people don't realize is if we allow this to continually happen, Big Pharma will just continually write what to them is a small check and move on down the road laughing all the way to the bank.
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:10.319]  But that doesn't bring back the loved ones that have died.
[02:21:10.479 --> 02:21:13.979]  That doesn't bring back people like my brother who died during this opioid crisis.
[02:21:13.979 --> 02:21:14.979]  Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:21:15.059 --> 02:21:15.260]  I know that.
[02:21:15.379 --> 02:21:27.639]  And to think that this is something that's just going to go away without the American people standing up and fighting for this, just so people have a little bit of history here, the Sackler family in the 70s created the Valium crisis.
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:28.920]  The same family.
[02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:30.180]  A lot of people don't know that.
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:34.500]  They were marketing to mothers and stay-at-home wives and saying, feeling a little anxious?
[02:21:34.659 --> 02:21:35.600]  Pop a Valium.
[02:21:35.850 --> 02:21:45.090]  And it was all over, news articles and magazines at the time, pushing that Valium was a safe, non-addictive way to help you with your stress and anxiety.
[02:21:45.250 --> 02:21:47.569]  Instead of drinking a martini, pop a Valium.
[02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:51.450]  And they created the Valium crisis and were able to buy their way out.
[02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:53.989]  And the women instead would have the martini and the Valium.
[02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:54.430]  Yeah.
[02:21:54.569 --> 02:21:55.670]  And then five more martinis.
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:59.479]  And these are the people we're talking about.
[02:21:59.799 --> 02:22:12.440]  If you look at Monsanto and Bayer, we can go all the way back to World War II. During World War II, Bayer Medicine literally used Jewish women and children from Nazi concentration camps to test their products on.
[02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:15.139]  And we can scoot to the 80s and 90s.
[02:22:15.299 --> 02:22:19.159]  Their own documents came out that they knew they were putting HIV and hepatitis in their factory blood product.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:22.379]  And it came out in the documents where they said, who cares if hemophiliacs die?
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.340]  That was in the documents.
[02:22:23.479 --> 02:22:23.680]  Yes.
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:38.879]  And in order to avoid scrutiny, not only did they know, they pushed these products to third world countries where there would be less line of sight or potentially regulatory interest or investigation.
[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:43.120]  And they did the same thing with certain chemical products on plants.
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:56.850]  If you look in the 80s, Monsanto pushed those products that were linked to cancer and baby deformities over to countries like Vietnam and Thailand, That was memorandum 200.
[02:22:57.149 --> 02:23:01.409]  Instead, though, by the 90s, they go, stop bombing the third world, mainly target America.
[02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:05.610]  And so the history here is rich.
[02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:06.610]  It runs deep.
[02:23:07.129 --> 02:23:09.069]  And that was our message to the Senate.
[02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:12.770]  We were attempting to just say, look, don't shoot the messenger.
[02:23:12.770 --> 02:23:14.569]  I'm just here to deliver the facts.
[02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:16.030]  Here's what Eisenhower said.
[02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:17.309]  Here's what I see.
[02:23:17.530 --> 02:23:24.670]  Here's what's truly happening every day, whether, again, the PBMs, the insurance companies, big pharma, big food.
[02:23:24.850 --> 02:23:29.450]  There is so many billions of dollars being made off chronic illness.
[02:23:29.959 --> 02:23:34.540]  The incentive systems here don't incentivize anyone to cure chronic disease.
[02:23:34.799 --> 02:23:39.500]  But 80% of chronic disease is preventable through diet, lifestyle, and nutrition.
[02:23:39.639 --> 02:23:42.180]  But our system is not set up to do that.
[02:23:42.299 --> 02:23:45.059]  And it's so siloed off and compartmentalized.
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:51.260]  When you go see your primary care and they have six minutes with you, you know, these clinicians are trying to stay up to speed.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:59.760]  And there was a study done by Harvard And what they found is within 24 months of your clinician graduating med school, almost everything they know is antiquated.
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:03.159]  That is how quickly this field of medicine is moving.
[02:24:03.579 --> 02:24:07.219]  But it comes down to diet, lifestyle, and nutrition are never discussed.
[02:24:07.459 --> 02:24:09.659]  There's no training on that in medical school.
[02:24:10.209 --> 02:24:11.270]  And you ask why?
[02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:13.709]  Because our medical schools are corporately captured.
[02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:21.030]  If you look at how we rank medical schools in academia, it's based off how many studies and research papers and grants they have.
[02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:24.590]  And those grants are based off of, are you willing to pay to play?
[02:24:24.829 --> 02:24:29.530]  So Big Pharma is who funds a lot of these grants at these academic institutes.
[02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:36.370]  Again, we're eager to please the people who are writing the checks, and we want to make sure that we don't burn bridges.
[02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:38.030]  And it's just human nature.
[02:24:38.229 --> 02:24:44.629]  And so these conflicts that have been built into our system are creating an array of issues that we're now seeing.
[02:24:44.969 --> 02:24:45.809]  All right, stay right there.
[02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:57.850]  I want to come back out of the break and play some of your Senate testimony, and then we're going to jump into all the rest of this incredible news, and then into the election, and Kennedy coming in with Trump, and a real chance of stopping this.
[02:24:57.930 --> 02:24:58.909]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:24:59.309 --> 02:25:00.129]  Stay with us, Brigham.
[02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:00.549]  You're amazing.

[02:26:00.739 --> 02:26:04.000]  I've heard so many times the healthcare system's broke.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.139]  The healthcare system's broke.
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:08.280]  And I want to be clear as day.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.260]  The healthcare system's not broke.
[02:26:10.459 --> 02:26:11.399]  It's rigged.
[02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:13.319]  And we're the ones fitting the bill.
[02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:30.590]  If we look at what's happening in this country, and we look at the chronic disease crisis that we're facing, and you peel back the layers to the onion, you realize that the cost is much more Than the dollars and cents.
[02:26:30.829 --> 02:26:32.370]  And we could get into the dollars and cents.
[02:26:32.489 --> 02:26:38.629]  I could tell you that healthcare is the number one budgetary concern for the federal government at 25%.
[02:26:38.629 --> 02:26:39.430]  It's in the top.
[02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:43.209]  It's the number one budgetary concern for most states.
[02:26:43.549 --> 02:26:48.030]  It's the number one reason for bankruptcy in our nation for individuals.
[02:26:49.049 --> 02:26:51.469]  But the costs are much more dire than that.
[02:26:52.149 --> 02:26:56.690]  They're paid in human lives, loved ones, friends, and family.
[02:26:58.059 --> 02:27:12.819]  As the brother of a victim to the opioid crisis, the son to a victim of the diabetes crisis, and a sibling to a victim of the mental health crisis, I can tell you that the stakes are not only real, but they're personal.
[02:27:13.819 --> 02:27:27.510]  And I would implore you next time you have the privilege of having dinner with your family, look around the table and ask yourselves, when you look into their eyes, what you would give to have Another year with that family member.
[02:27:27.729 --> 02:27:31.969]  Another month of health and happiness and joy and memories and moments.
[02:27:32.629 --> 02:27:36.069]  Because that was something that was taken from my family during the opioid crisis.
[02:27:38.129 --> 02:27:40.090]  This is not a Republican issue.
[02:27:40.690 --> 02:27:43.430]  This is not a Democrat issue.
[02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:45.530]  This is a humanity issue.
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:53.920]  If we really, truly want to address the chronic disease crisis in this country, we have to start by preventing these diseases from occurring in the first place.
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:28:01.940]  In medicine, we often say that to properly treat or prevent a chronic disease, we must first understand the root cause of that disease.
[02:28:02.219 --> 02:28:05.760]  I believe the same principle applies to business and politics.
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:11.940]  To truly grasp what is driving chronic disease epidemic, we must understand the root cause of the crisis.
[02:28:12.629 --> 02:28:17.610]  There is a cancer in our healthcare system, and it is insidious and spreading rapidly.
[02:28:19.959 --> 02:28:24.920]  That cancer is big industry, a broken system fueled by corruption and collusion.
[02:28:25.639 --> 02:28:28.340]  We cannot treat what we refuse to diagnose.
[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:42.840]  I have personally witnessed physicians unable to run necessary lab tests, unable to prescribe appropriate medications, unable to even perform investigations into their patients' conditions to uncover their root cause.
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:51.739]  We hear people reference President Eisenhower's speech all the time about the military industrial complex, but rarely do we hear the second half of that speech.
[02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:56.940]  He also warned us about the rise of the scientific industrial complex.
[02:28:57.399 --> 02:29:02.860]  He warned us if we allow the elite to control the scientific research, it could have dire consequences.
[02:29:03.659 --> 02:29:08.180]  The statistics and the data that we are presenting today illustrate that very nightmare.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:14.500]  How is it that Americans are so chronically ill despite spending more on healthcare than any other nation?
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:15.959]  The answer is simple.
[02:29:16.239 --> 02:29:21.600]  Private industry has traded patient outcomes and public health for quarterly profits and earnings.
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:28.459]  Private interest now dominates academia, scientific research, the governing and regulatory bodies.
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:33.819]  As a result, the focus has shifted away from patient care to corporate gain.
[02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:46.239]  What I ask this group of individuals today is to take off the blinders and look deeper into ourselves, into our institutions, because we have a real opportunity to effect meaningful change.
[02:29:46.739 --> 02:29:51.940]  The data and statistics that everyone's going to share today may feel overwhelming and at times hopeless.
[02:29:52.559 --> 02:29:55.420]  But I want to share with everyone one final statistic.
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:57.860]  400 trillion to 1.
[02:29:58.799 --> 02:30:02.479]  400 trillion to 1 are the odds that we're here today and alive.
[02:30:03.329 --> 02:30:04.590]  What are we gonna do with it?
[02:30:04.889 --> 02:30:06.829]  The time to act is now.
[02:30:08.170 --> 02:30:08.870]  That's it.
[02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:19.049]  And that's Brigham Mueller testifying a few weeks ago in front of the U.S. Senate.
[02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:22.149]  And I cannot tell you how big it is.
[02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.989]  I know everybody knows.
[02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:24.549]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:30:24.729 --> 02:30:25.489]  has broken through.
[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:26.889]  It broke two days ago.
[02:30:27.049 --> 02:30:28.389]  We probably should have covered it more.
[02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:53.459]  I mentioned it, but it turns out MI6 and the British government have, quote, been conducting the documents leaked, because people inside are good, some of them, that he's been targeted with black ops, That that could even include assassination because they're worried about him getting Trump elected and Big Pharma is so scared of him and they know the people are aware of what's happening and so COVID was their desperation power grab.
[02:30:53.659 --> 02:31:02.030]  Months before they released the COVID virus, the UN had a meeting in Helsinki Switzerland, and the head of their World Vaccine Program said, our own doctors don't want to do it.
[02:31:02.149 --> 02:31:03.590]  They know the shots don't work.
[02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:09.409]  They know they're killing people, regular vaccines, real vaccines, not these so-called mRNA shots that are just gene therapies.
[02:31:09.989 --> 02:31:12.370]  And they said, we're having a total collapse in confidence.
[02:31:12.370 --> 02:31:13.010]  What do we do?
[02:31:13.809 --> 02:31:20.170]  James O'Keefe just got new footage out of the UN, internal footage, where they said, everybody hates us.
[02:31:20.229 --> 02:31:20.969]  Everybody's turning against us.
[02:31:20.989 --> 02:31:22.010]  95% hate us.
[02:31:22.250 --> 02:31:23.209]  They know we're criminals.
[02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:29.770]  So the good news is the people are waking up The bad news is the globalists are going to strike back.
[02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:30.969]  Brigham, you got caught up on the break.
[02:31:31.049 --> 02:31:32.790]  You were just dropping the heavy knowledge.
[02:31:33.370 --> 02:31:36.510]  And by the way, I should point out, you've got one of the huge successful companies.
[02:31:37.049 --> 02:31:40.770]  Before that, you've done huge contracting for giant companies.
[02:31:40.889 --> 02:31:42.069]  You've run whole operations.
[02:31:42.649 --> 02:31:43.610]  Very, very successful.
[02:31:43.729 --> 02:31:45.750]  You've got Ways2Well, just the number two.
[02:31:45.969 --> 02:31:49.309]  So you spell out W-A-Y-S and the number two.
[02:31:49.690 --> 02:31:55.149]  Well.com and on the socials at Ways2Well, just everywhere, X, you name it.
[02:31:55.659 --> 02:31:56.780]  And so much more.
[02:31:56.899 --> 02:31:58.520]  People should really check it out.
[02:31:58.739 --> 02:32:02.200]  And you guys do some of the best comprehensive blood work around the country.
[02:32:02.379 --> 02:32:03.040]  I've done it with you.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.059]  Joe recommended you.
[02:32:04.219 --> 02:32:05.260]  Recommended you years ago.
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:07.520]  I've gotten in the last six months to see you.
[02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:08.540]  I've followed some of your advice.
[02:32:08.899 --> 02:32:09.860]  People have seen the health effects.
[02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:11.260]  That's a whole other discussion.
[02:32:11.459 --> 02:32:15.239]  And I know you weren't here about that today, but that stuff's not off record.
[02:32:16.139 --> 02:32:17.059]  You know, Joe's pretty excited.
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:18.020]  A lot of great stuff's going on.
[02:32:18.809 --> 02:32:19.649]  Yeah, no, thank you.
[02:32:19.729 --> 02:32:25.649]  And on the vaccines, if you want to look into the future, I think a good example would be to look into the past.
[02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:27.510]  It usually is telling on where we're headed.
[02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:34.930]  In 1984, a child would get 10 vaccines before they were 18.
[02:32:35.709 --> 02:32:41.209]  Today, a child is getting 70-plus vaccines before the age of 18.
[02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:44.709]  In 1984, do you know what the autism rate was?
[02:32:45.129 --> 02:32:47.270]  It was 1 in 10,000.
[02:32:48.459 --> 02:33:02.600]  Today, with this new vaccine schedule, the autism rate is 1 in 36, with projections going to autism rates potentially getting as high as 1 in 3 within the next 5 years.
[02:33:04.509 --> 02:33:05.930]  Don't be fooled.
[02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:15.770]  There are absolutely correlations and risks associated with any treatment and I'm not here to say one thing is bad and one thing is good.
[02:33:16.129 --> 02:33:29.379]  I try to be fair and I try to just be honest and open with what I saw and what I experienced and just be forthcoming with With the American people on what's going on behind the scenes in healthcare.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:35.399]  And the truth is, a lot of times the science backing this data is corrupted.
[02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:55.069]  I don't know if you're aware of this, Alex, but even the head of the scientific, the head of Biden's Scientific Integrity Committee Literally is banned from the scientific community for her misrepresentation of scientific data.
[02:33:55.250 --> 02:34:00.030]  And this is who we have over the head of the White House's Scientific Integrity Committee.
[02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:01.450]  It's insane.
[02:34:01.649 --> 02:34:02.329]  Jane...
[02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:26.819]  I attached the link on our links page but she is now the head and she was she got busted for misrepresenting a global warming scientific analysis where she used her brother-in-law to draft essentially a mock We're good to go.
[02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:39.270]  It's under the blog section and it's the very top thing at the blog section.
[02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:44.670]  But I did this on Joe and it resonated with folks because a lot of what I am saying could be controversial.
[02:34:45.229 --> 02:34:50.690]  And so I just want to make sure that I give people the resources and the data to back up anything I'm saying.
[02:34:51.829 --> 02:35:00.049]  And yeah, it's pretty staggering and it's pretty scary to think what the future holds with these things if we don't begin to fight back.
[02:35:00.829 --> 02:35:16.510]  Absolutely, and I wanted to get you on the show, just because of all the great work you do, and also tell people, it starts with getting blood work done, and you do it all over the country, you've got clinics as well, but you can just do it anywhere in the country, ways2well.com, and you guys also,
[02:35:16.569 --> 02:35:19.489]  you look at the genetics of people and how that's affected.
[02:35:19.850 --> 02:35:26.629]  People go to ways2well.com, use promo code ALEX for 10% off on comprehensive blood work, and not all blood work's the same.
[02:35:27.079 --> 02:35:29.920]  Yeah, I'll tell you, this is how I got into this.
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:32.739]  When I was, I left being a drug rep and a device rep.
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:38.079]  And one of the things that I started first was trying to educate clinicians on not prescribing opioids.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:40.340]  I had lost my brother to the opioid crisis.
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:47.920]  There were legitimate alternative options, non-abusive, non-addictive options that patients could utilize to address their chronic pain.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.399]  But what I saw is the sinister side of the insurance companies.
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.399]  Within six months, the insurance companies quit covering opioids.
[02:35:55.899 --> 02:36:05.540]  Topical pain creams and pushed patients back to $10 a month opioids, which are chronically addictive, chronically abused, and creating a crisis in this country.
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:12.620]  And I would also go out and educate clinicians owning a blood lab on the importance of pulling comprehensive blood work.
[02:36:12.799 --> 02:36:16.340]  And when I talk about corporate capture, what I saw...
[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:37.579]  We're good to go.
[02:36:40.959 --> 02:36:42.540]  These primary cares are on the ropes.
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:43.920]  They're barely making it.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:52.979]  And in fact, another study from Harvard found that the majority, we're going to have a major primary care shortage within the next five years.
[02:36:53.319 --> 02:36:59.700]  Most primary cares are considering exiting the space because it's such a thankless job and their hands are tied.
[02:37:00.159 --> 02:37:12.920]  They're working their tails off to try and provide care for people, but a lot of the care is suppressed or controlled by the insurance companies, and insurance companies will not allow your primary care to pull comprehensive blood work.
[02:37:13.379 --> 02:37:16.899]  And so we started Ways to Well as essentially an escape raft.
[02:37:16.989 --> 02:37:23.170]  I tell people, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, in this healthcare space, you've got a front row seat on the Titanic.
[02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:29.270]  We have got to get proactive and predictive, and the existing healthcare system's not built to do that.
[02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:38.569]  With insurance, the easiest way to explain it in a way that hopefully makes sense to the listeners is, I tell people, think of your insurance, your health insurance, like car insurance.
[02:37:38.959 --> 02:37:41.540]  It is there if you wreck the fucking car.
[02:37:41.739 --> 02:37:49.780]  It is not there to prevent the car from blowing a motor, blowing a gasket, losing a tire.
[02:37:50.059 --> 02:37:52.739]  It's going to be your job to maintain the car.
[02:37:52.879 --> 02:37:55.899]  And when something catastrophic happens, the insurance is there.
[02:37:56.159 --> 02:37:58.739]  It is your job to maintain your body.
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:03.239]  The insurance does not cover predictive or proactive preventative care.
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:06.979]  And so they don't want your blood getting tested by experts to see what's actually going on with you.
[02:38:07.609 --> 02:38:16.729]  Because they just want to continue down the path they've chosen for you, and not letting somebody know what's going on is one of the greatest forms of lying, lying by omission.
[02:38:17.250 --> 02:38:20.850]  So you're the expert on this, and I understand how it works, but you know the technicals.
[02:38:21.229 --> 02:38:23.829]  And we can tell this was happening back during the whole COVID rollout.
[02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:26.030]  They were blocking ivermectin.
[02:38:26.190 --> 02:38:32.610]  Big pharmacies like Walgreens, CVS, would not give it to you, even if your doctor prescribed it, which they're allowed to do off-labeled.
[02:38:33.409 --> 02:38:40.569]  They already had studies that the Pentagon had done over a decade before, knowing that ivermectin was super antiviral and a wonder drug, along with a bunch of other stuff.
[02:38:40.729 --> 02:38:49.489]  So they paid it, came out, over $2 billion just to Walgreens, the federal government did, Walgreens and CBS alone, not to prescribe that.
[02:38:49.709 --> 02:38:51.750]  Now that's not just because they want people to get better.
[02:38:52.379 --> 02:38:58.379]  It was also because they didn't want them to know that that was cheap, and there they wanted them to have the rendezivir.
[02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:04.739]  They wanted them to take the so-called vaccine that wasn't a vaccine that they admit now doesn't work and actually has a lot of serious problems, obviously.
[02:39:06.729 --> 02:39:09.549]  What's the mechanism of that cold-bloodedness being baked in?
[02:39:09.709 --> 02:39:12.469]  And it wasn't just in the U.S. It was in Canada, Europe, Australia.
[02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:14.750]  This is global, the exact same policies.
[02:39:14.909 --> 02:39:24.110]  And then a $53,000 bounty on anybody they intubated with a ventilator, whether you were in Australia, Germany, the U.S., U.K., globally, they had a global...
[02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:27.530]  It would all equate out with euros or other currencies to $53,000.
[02:39:27.930 --> 02:39:30.090]  They even had bounties on how they wanted you treated.
[02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:31.209]  Who created that?
[02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:32.149]  How did they...
[02:39:32.659 --> 02:39:36.840]  Who gets the money to pharmacies to not prescribe medicines that are legal to somebody?
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:38.180]  I mean, that shows total control.
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.459]  It does all sound wild.
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:53.600]  I know it sounds pretty out there, but I will say during COVID, our pharmacy got letters from the state of Texas pharmacy board saying that we are not allowed to dispense ivermectin, which is just crazy.
[02:39:53.799 --> 02:39:55.760]  I mean, we're allowed to dispense ketamine.
[02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:29.280]  Ivermectin If the people were aware that there were potential alternatives, I'm not here to say ivermectin is or isn't the right choice, but I think that's a choice for an individual and their clinician to make, not for the federal government.
[02:40:29.819 --> 02:40:31.459]  But, I mean, I brought this up like you may have known about it.
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:32.200]  It didn't get much coverage.
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:33.120]  It came out six months ago.
[02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:41.579]  It was like, USA Today even admitted, 2.2 or 2.3 billion just to those two big pharmacies not to prescribe it.
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:42.239]  Did you see that?
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:43.040]  Yeah, I did.
[02:40:43.219 --> 02:40:44.540]  I'm wondering, what's the mechanism?
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:45.459]  How do they do that?
[02:40:45.899 --> 02:41:04.059]  Yeah, I don't know how they did that part, but I do know we got we literally as a pharmacy got warning letters saying do not dispense ivermectin for any COVID related and we could risk our pharmacy license and it also wanted us to turn in licenses of clinicians and we had you know hundreds of thousands of dollars of ivermectin at our pharmacy.
[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:10.229]  Ready to deploy in the event a patient or clinician decided that was the best course of action for them.
[02:41:10.729 --> 02:41:12.430]  And that's just wild to me.
[02:41:13.889 --> 02:41:17.469]  Clinicians are allowed to use drugs off-label every day.
[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:19.690]  In fact, one example would be testosterone.
[02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:24.329]  80% of the testosterone prescribed in this nation is prescribed off-label.
[02:41:26.010 --> 02:41:28.290]  The clinical protocols really don't make sense.
[02:41:28.450 --> 02:41:42.329]  As science has evolved, a lot of times the science and the know-how of clinicians in the trenches is a lot stronger and further progressed than where it stands in the academic process.
[02:41:43.709 --> 02:41:45.770]  Well, that's a whole other area.
[02:41:45.989 --> 02:41:50.610]  You are an expert with all your scientists and doctors and one of the leading guys, people that don't know.
[02:41:51.069 --> 02:41:53.049]  Most people probably know who he is if you're into health.
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:08.600]  They have studies that the estrogen mimickers, the chemicals, the atrazine, not just humans, other mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, the males are being small, scrawny, more feminine.
[02:42:09.299 --> 02:42:13.120]  The male frogs are attracted to other male frogs, so their populations collapse.
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:18.899]  We're good to go.
[02:42:34.049 --> 02:43:04.309]  And then instead of when a boy's had his gender bent because of in utero, the fetus gets atrazine, he's not a female, but it lessens the male manifestation and development of We do know physiologically
[02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:09.090]  the male testosterone level on average right now in the United States is half of what it was in the 80s.
[02:43:09.229 --> 02:43:09.590]  Half.
[02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:13.920]  Male fertility is on the cusp of infertile.
[02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:23.479]  Like, male fertility is now down to, I think, 37,000 or 37 million sperm count per whatever it is.
[02:43:23.559 --> 02:43:27.500]  And it's essentially, once you go below 37, it's considered infertile.
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:29.340]  They would put you on fertility drugs.
[02:43:29.459 --> 02:43:35.200]  And as a country, as a nation, the male population is truly becoming infertile.
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:36.500]  And these are scary, scary...
[02:43:42.300 --> 02:43:56.799]  We're good to go.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.659]  Is to put everyone on a GLP-1.
[02:44:02.079 --> 02:44:05.879]  There's currently a bill, and we offer GLP-1s.
[02:44:06.319 --> 02:44:07.879]  I'm not here to say they're bad.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.520]  They are a tool in the tool belt.
[02:44:09.860 --> 02:44:15.459]  And that tool in the tool belt, when utilized appropriately in the right patient population, could make sense.
[02:44:16.159 --> 02:44:25.540]  But sticking our children with drugs that have no long-term data at an early age because we're poisoning them through our food sources and creating...
[02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:27.239]  You're saying stop the poisoning of the children.
[02:44:27.459 --> 02:44:33.340]  Yeah, it would be a lot more logical to let's just stop poisoning our children with all these ingredients.
[02:44:33.659 --> 02:44:38.319]  And let's be clear, I'm not a top expert like you, but just to be clear, it's happening in animal populations, not just human.
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:44.360]  The girls are expressing feminine traits early and are hyperfeminine, which gives them cancer, accelerates aging.
[02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:46.399]  They go, as you said, six years younger.
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:48.079]  Some three-year-old girls are going into puberty now.
[02:44:48.420 --> 02:44:49.520]  Average age used to be 14.
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:50.920]  Now it's like nine or whatever.
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:55.020]  So these chemicals are estrogen mimickers just to...
[02:44:55.459 --> 02:44:56.639]  And endocrine disruptors.
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:59.719]  So they're hyperfeminizing women and then feminizing men.
[02:44:59.899 --> 02:45:00.500]  That's what's happening.
[02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:04.739]  We know that these impact hormones astronomically.
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:08.799]  And we know that these chemicals, not only the chemicals, also the microplastics.
[02:45:08.979 --> 02:45:16.159]  You know, one of the fascinating things I learned at the Senate hearing, there was a brilliant doctor from Harvard, Dr.
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:16.600]  Palmer.
[02:45:16.879 --> 02:45:19.139]  And this was a staggering statistic.
[02:45:19.139 --> 02:45:20.360]  I had never heard that.
[02:45:20.729 --> 02:45:26.110]  Basically, at this point, 5% of the human brain weight in America is microplastic.
[02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:26.590]  Wow!
[02:45:27.549 --> 02:45:27.989]  5%.
[02:45:27.989 --> 02:45:40.649]  And so when we're talking to the Senate and they're asking for studies and research, it's like, I don't have to go to Harvard to tell you having 5% of my brain weight being microplastics probably ain't a good thing.
[02:45:40.770 --> 02:45:41.370]  That's probably just...
[02:45:41.370 --> 02:45:42.450]  And what's happening with these?
[02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:47.049]  Because I know even as food addicts, the FDA, I saw a headline two years ago, approved...
[02:45:47.989 --> 02:45:50.829]  Nanotech in the food, and I looked it up, it's nanotech plastic.
[02:45:50.969 --> 02:45:51.809]  What the hell are they doing?
[02:45:52.370 --> 02:46:00.790]  Well, the challenge is, and this is where things start to get when we talk about corporate capture, 50% of the FDA's funding comes from Big Pharma, 50%.
[02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:03.450]  But another big chunk comes from Big Food.
[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:08.290]  And what a lot of people don't know is Big Food has to pay by the batch.
[02:46:08.649 --> 02:46:21.489]  So if I'm an executive at Kellogg's and I'm making these bright, colorful, addictive cereals that I can put into the marketplace and market to children in America, I just have to pay to play.
[02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:36.110]  I have to put together a study that shows at the right dosage that this is not causing harm to a patient population, and I self-report that data to the FDA. And then the FDA charges you a fee per batch.
[02:46:36.459 --> 02:46:40.440]  And so every time a new batch of cereal comes out, the FDA is getting paid.
[02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:47.610]  And I go back to this is the incentive system that creates It's a challenge.
[02:46:47.889 --> 02:46:50.049]  This is a real, real problem.
[02:46:50.569 --> 02:47:08.090]  And a group of bright and driven and motivated citizens got together and marched to Kellogg's a few weeks ago and made national news where they had a petition with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans that had signed asking Kellogg's for something very simple.
[02:47:08.729 --> 02:47:11.610]  Please just sell us what you're selling Europe.
[02:47:11.889 --> 02:47:17.049]  You have the ability, you have the manufacturing capabilities, you're already making these products.
[02:47:18.270 --> 02:47:27.290]  Please, just sell the American people the same less dangerous products that you're selling our Canadian and our European brothers and sisters.
[02:47:27.889 --> 02:47:32.549]  And Kellogg's had signs up in the windows, refused to accept the petitions.
[02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:35.930]  And this is where we said, we can't wait on the Senate.
[02:47:36.129 --> 02:47:37.569]  We cannot wait on the government.
[02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:41.049]  The American people have to speak with their pocketbooks.
[02:47:41.559 --> 02:47:50.579]  You know, just hurting one of these big conglomerates profits by 3% would be enough to probably bring them to their knees and force change.
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.659]  And the American people have that power.
[02:47:52.899 --> 02:48:03.239]  You know, we can work together to demand better, whether from big food, big pharma, big insurance, you know, a combined effort and a unified front.
[02:48:03.239 --> 02:48:06.020]  This is truly a human issue.
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.760]  And if we align and work together, it's an issue that we could solve pretty easily.
[02:48:13.390 --> 02:48:14.790]  Yeah.
[02:48:15.250 --> 02:48:15.270]  Yeah.
[02:48:23.170 --> 02:48:23.170]  Yeah.
[02:48:34.350 --> 02:48:38.129]  If they do try to steal this again, because they are currently saying it's going to go for weeks.
[02:48:38.409 --> 02:48:40.370]  They're currently saying they're not going to certify Trump.
[02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:41.350]  Top Democrats are.
[02:48:41.690 --> 02:48:45.290]  They're clearly saying he's going to get violent and kill black people with no evidence.
[02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:51.930]  I know how to extrapolate from watching the deep state before when they're saying Trump supporters are imminently going to kill Hispanics and blacks.
[02:48:52.549 --> 02:48:56.649]  Looks to me like they're getting ready to provocateur that or do that to blame Trump.
[02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:57.409]  I'm really concerned.
[02:48:59.270 --> 02:49:01.450]  Yeah, it's definitely wild times.
[02:49:01.610 --> 02:49:08.649]  I know my touch point and my experience is definitely on the healthcare side, and I met this group through Bobby.
[02:49:08.889 --> 02:49:36.459]  You know, RFK had heard my Rogan podcast and invited me to meet him in Dallas, and I just was educating him on what I'm educating your listeners on, what I saw, what I experienced, the challenges of trying to work within the confines of this system, and Bobby was fascinated and was kind enough to invite me on his podcast and then introduced me to Callie Means and some of these other thought leaders that are ringing the bell that are Callie and Casey Means in their book,
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:37.100]  Good Energy.
[02:49:37.659 --> 02:49:40.799]  I think it's like 19 weeks on the New York Times bestseller.
[02:49:40.979 --> 02:49:43.399]  But what they're doing is a lot like what I'm doing.
[02:49:43.559 --> 02:49:50.280]  They're trying to systematically bring light to these areas of corruption, collusion and corporate capture.
[02:49:52.129 --> 02:49:52.409]  Absolutely.
[02:49:52.770 --> 02:49:58.350]  And when you see me pointing at the crew, we'll put this out as a tape later, our cover, live now, and I'll say, ooh, put that up front.
[02:49:58.430 --> 02:49:59.889]  We're going to take some of the stuff you say and put it up front.
[02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:01.270]  Because you're just knocking it out of the park.
[02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:05.469]  And what's so exciting is, as negative as everything is, this is being talked about everywhere.
[02:50:05.549 --> 02:50:06.409]  This is the hot issue.
[02:50:06.510 --> 02:50:07.229]  It's on Fox News.
[02:50:07.329 --> 02:50:07.750]  It's everywhere.
[02:50:07.889 --> 02:50:08.950]  It's all over talk radio.
[02:50:09.209 --> 02:50:10.329]  People talk about it at church.
[02:50:10.649 --> 02:50:11.790]  People talk about the grocery store.
[02:50:11.889 --> 02:50:13.629]  I mean, people are like, yeah, why is everybody dying?
[02:50:13.989 --> 02:50:15.270]  Why are the kids all sick?
[02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:17.110]  What's going on?
[02:50:17.229 --> 02:50:17.709]  I mean...
[02:50:18.659 --> 02:50:19.600]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:19.700 --> 02:50:20.139]  Stay with us.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.799]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:26.659]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:29.079]  Our great sponsor, yellowshownstore.com.
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:34.399]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[02:50:34.579 --> 02:50:42.780]  And I, cause I hadn't really, you know, cause other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great Patriot backers, total Patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:46.030]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[02:50:46.270 --> 02:50:49.969]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:12.879]  Monthly member credits.
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:18.500]  Every month, as a VIP member, you get $40 of free store credit.
[02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:19.940]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:20.399]  That's right.
[02:51:20.659 --> 02:51:24.100]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:28.399]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:29.500]  That's $10 you make.
[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:40.340]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, and sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:44.280]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[02:51:44.799 --> 02:51:53.040]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:56.420]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced on the 30th this month.
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:57.420]  You want to win?
[02:51:57.639 --> 02:52:01.340]  I know you do, because the VFP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:03.920]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[02:52:04.319 --> 02:52:06.200]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:08.100]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[02:52:08.239 --> 02:52:11.700]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:13.459]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:16.239]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[02:52:16.479 --> 02:52:21.520]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[02:52:21.719 --> 02:52:22.739]  You're in the know.
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:24.979]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[02:52:25.579 --> 02:52:26.180]  Free shipping.
[02:52:26.399 --> 02:52:29.360]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[02:52:29.559 --> 02:52:30.760]  It just goes on from there.
[02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:36.190]  TheAllocShowStore.com forward slash VIP. Forward is at the top of TheAllocShowStore.com.
[02:52:36.290 --> 02:52:37.870]  You see the VIP button.
[02:52:38.209 --> 02:52:40.209]  We're fighting the new world order.
[02:52:40.329 --> 02:52:42.090]  I don't have millionaire backers.
[02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:48.229]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain, I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.969]  TheAllocShowStore.com.
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:56.260]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:05.579]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:12.819]  And I just don't know why I'm this lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[02:53:12.979 --> 02:53:14.979]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:17.940]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[02:53:18.379 --> 02:53:19.120]  We've already...
[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:21.120]  Just devastated them.
[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:24.299]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[02:53:24.639 --> 02:53:25.860]  The whole world's turning against them.
[02:53:26.379 --> 02:53:30.139]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[02:53:30.579 --> 02:53:42.610]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these So, again, I don't give up.
[02:53:42.750 --> 02:53:45.489]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[02:53:45.790 --> 02:53:49.129]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[02:53:49.430 --> 02:53:51.569]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:53.069]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[02:53:53.370 --> 02:54:01.770]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[02:54:02.010 --> 02:54:06.750]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[02:54:08.139 --> 02:54:10.159]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:12.620]  I mean, it's just...
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:13.959]  This is a joke.
[02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:15.440]  This is ridiculous.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.000]  We're changing the world.
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:20.000]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[02:54:20.399 --> 02:54:22.040]  All right, Brigham Mueller is our guest.
[02:54:22.139 --> 02:54:26.159]  We're going to get into the case for Trump straight ahead and some amazing clips with him.
[02:54:26.239 --> 02:54:29.920]  We're also going to look at the campaign and just other issues other than health, how it all ties together.
[02:54:30.139 --> 02:54:32.260]  We got Cali Means, the case for Trump.
[02:54:32.500 --> 02:54:34.680]  Cali Means expands on that.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:35.280]  You know what?
[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:39.159]  Let's actually play clip four and five Right now.
[02:54:39.899 --> 02:54:41.079]  And then jam in clip 11.
[02:54:41.379 --> 02:54:43.879]  Because 350 stations don't carry the first five.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.059]  I don't want anybody to miss that.
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:46.520]  Then we'll come back and break it all down.
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:46.959]  Stay with us.
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:51.959]  Lives always fun.
[02:54:51.979 --> 02:54:59.520]  This year in 2024 is the highest rate in American history of Alzheimer's, cancer, autoimmune conditions, heart disease.
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:06.780]  Every single chronic disease you can think of is at an all-time high growing at an increasing rate as we spend more money to treat those conditions.
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:08.879]  But we have to realize this isn't a conspiracy.
[02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:10.819]  It's true corruption.
[02:55:13.239 --> 02:55:14.540]  There's a war right now.
[02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:17.309]  Between incrementalists and radical change.
[02:55:17.469 --> 02:55:20.030]  We are living in a great time, but we have existential threats.
[02:55:20.430 --> 02:55:28.149]  And the question before everyone in this very important election is, do we need more incrementality or do we need a fundamental rethink of some of our major systems?
[02:55:28.290 --> 02:55:37.409]  I think RFK standing on the stage with Trump and them grasping hands and saying, make America healthy, I think it was one of the biggest political realignments and important moments in American history.
[02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:38.569]  Let me make this super clear.
[02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:39.610]  It's powerful.
[02:55:39.770 --> 02:55:41.250]  These interests, they're not monolithic.
[02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:43.510]  We can overcome this.
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:50.340]  Every single member of Congress tells me, they said the only thing that beats money is Americans focusing on the issue.
[02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:52.219]  This doesn't change without executive leadership.
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:53.840]  It's just a factual statement.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.500]  I hate that health is political.
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:56.000]  It's not.
[02:55:56.120 --> 02:55:56.700]  It's bipartisan.
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.739]  It is political in the next 40 days.
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:07.319]  And there is the benefit of him having already been in and understanding all the red tape and all the problems that he couldn't correct in four years.
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:09.459]  There's one candidate they're shooting at.
[02:56:09.819 --> 02:56:10.299]  Yeah.
[02:56:11.239 --> 02:56:12.159]  There's one candidate.
[02:56:21.739 --> 02:56:25.319]  President Trump's the foundation of his existence is taking on corruption.
[02:56:25.479 --> 02:56:26.860]  That is why he's on the political stage.
[02:56:26.940 --> 02:56:29.479]  That is why he's been the defining political figure of our generation.
[02:56:29.719 --> 02:56:35.159]  Many listeners are battling, surely, chronic conditions, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, etc.
[02:56:35.659 --> 02:56:38.579]  I don't think any listener in their head wants to be sick.
[02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:43.840]  Because he's tapped into this frustration of voters that something isn't quite right.
[02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:45.479]  That thesis is correct.
[02:56:46.750 --> 02:57:03.229]  We will be on the verge, I think, of a health population collapse, societally destabilizing event unless true executive leadership sees this corruption and this issue for what it is and says we need a radical transformation in how we see agriculture and how we see health,
[02:57:03.309 --> 02:57:04.190]  our two largest industries.
[02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:15.129]  If we believe that what's happening to our soil and to our bodies and to our kids' health is really the most important issue, it doesn't change without strong moral clarity and executive leadership.
[02:57:15.420 --> 02:57:21.040]  We also know that he's going to put good people in charge and not stand in their way and wants to be bold.
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:22.620]  There's two important questions to ask.
[02:57:23.379 --> 02:57:28.180]  Who sees this corruption that's going to destroy our country, I think, to an existential level?
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:30.020]  And who is willing to suffer that blowback?
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:35.479]  I think this requires a real shift in consciousness of people and a real understanding of what's going on.
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:36.520]  There's one candidate.
[02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:43.520]  The most profitable asset in America today is a sick child.
[02:57:43.799 --> 02:57:47.739]  Basically, our population and mass is being drugged for profit.
[02:57:47.899 --> 02:57:51.139]  The money's made keeping them chronically ill, keeping them on drugs.
[02:57:51.299 --> 02:57:55.520]  It's the same structure, it's the same problem, and it's all motivated by money.
[02:57:55.739 --> 02:58:00.319]  One of the ways I would have to address it would be to encourage people to become metabolically healthy.
[02:58:00.479 --> 02:58:01.940]  We have zero encouragement.
[02:58:02.159 --> 02:58:03.579]  In fact, it is actually the opposite.
[02:58:03.899 --> 02:58:08.280]  And don't you want a president that's gonna make America healthy again?
[02:58:10.069 --> 02:58:13.370]  I did the unthinkable, which was to join the Trump campaign.
[02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:24.170]  This occurred after weeks and weeks of talks with that campaign in which we became convinced of their commitment to make America healthier again.
[02:58:24.430 --> 02:58:26.930]  And he said to me, I want to leave this as my legacy.
[02:58:27.129 --> 02:58:28.829]  He's only going to be in for four years.
[02:58:28.969 --> 02:58:30.209]  This is what he told me.
[02:58:30.350 --> 02:58:35.629]  The best thing that he could do with his administration is to end the chronic disease epidemic.
[02:58:36.209 --> 02:58:41.930]  It got me into a position where I can actually do something to end the chronic disease epidemic.
[02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:43.510]  And we're going to start on day one.
[02:58:43.629 --> 02:58:45.549]  We're going to declare a public emergency.
[02:58:53.700 --> 02:58:58.459]  Today, almost 50% of teens in the United States are overweight or obese.
[02:58:58.920 --> 02:59:04.479]  If a foreign nation did this to our country, we would consider an act of war.
[02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:08.440]  More children are being diagnosed with metabolic disease, diabetes...
[02:59:09.119 --> 02:59:10.319]  Yeah, he's amazing.
[02:59:10.659 --> 02:59:11.680]  Let's talk about Elon Musk.
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:14.680]  Brigham Mueller is an amazing individual, very smart.
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:18.540]  He's all over the place, just like RFK Jr., right up there with him, battling tyranny.
[02:59:19.079 --> 02:59:24.360]  And we'll put on screen, he just got back on X here just recently, and that's...
[02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:28.729]  Right there at ways2well.com.
[02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:30.590]  You definitely want to check that out.
[02:59:30.969 --> 02:59:38.969]  All right, you've got a lot to say, and I was jumping in a lot, but just you are talking to, right now, 5 million people tuned in one way or another, more than that.
[02:59:39.409 --> 02:59:43.870]  And then by Sunday, this interview will probably have 30 million people that have watched this.
[02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:45.090]  You're talking to 30 million people.
[02:59:45.309 --> 02:59:46.569]  What else do you want to impart to them?
[02:59:46.850 --> 02:59:49.809]  The biggest is, you know, the message is being stifled.
[02:59:50.049 --> 02:59:53.010]  Again, people can think this is conspiratorial, but it's facts.
[02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.750]  I've lived it.
[02:59:54.370 --> 03:00:02.989]  I did Jillian Michaels' podcast, and Jillian, you know, and I went hard in the paint against big pharma and big pharmacy benefit managers and insurance.
[03:00:03.250 --> 03:00:08.629]  And Jillian called me and said, Brigham, you know, the podcast we did that was sound only...
[03:00:08.889 --> 03:00:11.770]  Got X amount of views, like blew it out of the water.
[03:00:12.010 --> 03:00:17.629]  But the podcast we did with video got de-algorithm, de-platformed and suppressed.
[03:00:18.149 --> 03:00:23.809]  And there is an active campaign to suppress this type of information and knowledge.
[03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:25.850]  And we saw it coming out the tail end of the Senate.
[03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:31.750]  And you and I were just talking off air about Elon Musk and X and thank God for Elon and free speech.
[03:00:31.850 --> 03:00:36.590]  Because I don't know if we'd have free speech much longer if it wasn't for folks like Elon Musk.
[03:00:36.729 --> 03:00:38.770]  And that's genuinely how I feel.
[03:00:38.809 --> 03:00:40.870]  No, if people go to X and type in RFK Jr.
[03:00:41.090 --> 03:00:52.729]  targeted with black ops, it'll pull up the mainstream news articles where it turned out MI6 hired a private group, because it's illegal what they're doing, is their front group, to quote, target him with black ops to stop his message of health.
[03:00:53.049 --> 03:00:55.030]  What's MI6 doing trying to block that?
[03:00:55.260 --> 03:01:13.180]  Literally, the day after a group of us testified in front of the Senate, several hatchet job articles came out trying to debunk or belittle the message that me and all these other individuals who traveled across the country and took times out of our day to talk to the Senate and just say,
[03:01:13.260 --> 03:01:15.959]  guys, we're just asking the question, a new approach to healthcare.
[03:01:16.639 --> 03:01:18.100]  What we're doing is not working.
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:19.780]  Let's talk about our food.
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:22.120]  Let's talk about diet, lifestyle, and nutrition.
[03:01:22.459 --> 03:01:24.680]  These should not be polarizing topics.
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:32.459]  The very next day, the Atlantic, and I know there's been a lot about the Atlantic the last few days, exposing its ties.
[03:01:32.959 --> 03:01:50.209]  The Atlantic wrote an article, a Hatchet Job article, calling it the Woo Woo Conference, and said that it was a bunch of influencers with no clinicians, which was very misleading because our testimony in front of the Senate or our roundtable in front of the Senate included Very highly trained,
[03:01:50.450 --> 03:01:53.030]  very intelligent folks like Casey Means, Cali Means.
[03:01:53.309 --> 03:02:03.409]  We had Stanford, Harvard, John Hopkins, doctors, PhD psychiatrists, people from all walks of life.
[03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:06.250]  If there was anyone there not qualified, I was the least qualified.
[03:02:06.510 --> 03:02:10.010]  And my message was one of, let's ask the question.
[03:02:10.049 --> 03:02:11.569]  I'm an industry insider.
[03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:16.129]  I'm just here to tell you what I've seen and try and bring light to the truth.
[03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:17.649]  Yeah, and I want to put this on screen.
[03:02:17.809 --> 03:02:30.010]  Anybody can go to X. You just type in RFK Jr., RFKJR.BlackOps, and you'll get the newspaper articles about MI6, this broke two days ago, targeting him for destruction.
[03:02:30.860 --> 03:02:33.180]  I mean, this is just...
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:34.520]  Look, I've experienced it.
[03:02:34.659 --> 03:02:35.680]  It came out in court.
[03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:38.020]  The FBI ran the lawsuits against me.
[03:02:38.399 --> 03:02:40.059]  And the rigged show trials.
[03:02:40.239 --> 03:02:42.719]  And the CIA, it leaked, was involved.
[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:44.440]  I mean, people need to understand.
[03:02:44.459 --> 03:02:48.600]  We're in a war against corporate hijackers of our governments.
[03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:50.280]  And they're all ganged up on us.
[03:02:50.319 --> 03:02:53.520]  But the good news is, this awakening is so big, they're scared.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:54.940]  And their own internal documents have leaked.
[03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:56.799]  And now, let's play the RFK Jr.
[03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:57.340]  clip in a minute.
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:59.600]  I know I said I'd play it last hour, but he spoke yesterday.
[03:03:00.649 --> 03:03:03.329]  About, you know, the criminal indictment of Bill Gates in the Netherlands.
[03:03:03.510 --> 03:03:05.690]  So they can run, Brigham, but the tide's turned.
[03:03:05.770 --> 03:03:06.350]  They can't hide.
[03:03:08.569 --> 03:03:09.750]  Where do you see this going?
[03:03:10.110 --> 03:03:11.010]  I can tell you.
[03:03:11.129 --> 03:03:22.430]  Well, what was crazy to me is, as we're layering through this, one of the other articles the next day, when we peel back the layers to the onion, you're spot on.
[03:03:22.610 --> 03:03:29.549]  As we began to peel back the layers, one thing is I told Joe, I said, it's terrifying to me that they're having this strong and this...
[03:03:32.110 --> 03:03:42.229]  We're good to go.
[03:03:48.770 --> 03:04:02.350]  It literally was a PR firm that is owned by Monsanto attempting to push this agenda and this narrative to trivialize the concerns of American mothers about the poisoning of our children and our food system.
[03:04:02.829 --> 03:04:07.870]  And it was met another woman who's a PhD, Callie Means.
[03:04:08.110 --> 03:04:09.270]  This was a pretty good one.
[03:04:09.309 --> 03:04:10.309]  I think you'd like, Alex.
[03:04:10.610 --> 03:04:17.010]  She took to Twitter and basically said, these food dyes are safe and there's no reason why we should even be having this conversation.
[03:04:17.770 --> 03:04:24.209]  And Callie Means tweeted back and said, you're currently violating FCC rules.
[03:04:24.350 --> 03:04:28.350]  You are not disclosing that you are a bought and paid for consultant for Monsanto.
[03:04:28.610 --> 03:04:39.549]  And so what scares me is if we do this with food and something as simple and benign as like our food and wanting healthier food for children and families, what else are we doing this with?
[03:04:39.610 --> 03:04:40.709]  And how far does it go?
[03:04:40.829 --> 03:04:41.829]  And how deep does it go?
[03:04:42.149 --> 03:04:43.129]  I don't know.
[03:04:43.229 --> 03:04:47.129]  But I can tell you what I've seen in my sector is pretty terrifying.
[03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:51.340]  Well, what Cali means is just so well-spoken and so on target.
[03:04:51.579 --> 03:04:59.719]  And, you know, they went on six months ago or so on Tucker and talked about, you know, the frogs, the atrazine and a large portion of the frogs are now attracted to males.
[03:04:59.959 --> 03:05:08.200]  And the liberals, David Hogg, attacked me and said, well, it's good to have gay frogs, except that their populations collapse on the verge of many species of frogs being extinct.
[03:05:09.010 --> 03:05:15.489]  And so that's just collateral damage of this chemical attack on us through the food and water that's wiping out the animals, too.
[03:05:15.629 --> 03:05:16.989]  That tells you how intense it is.
[03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:42.680]  It is crazy to think that we spray chemicals on our crops and in our fields and on our crops, and these chemicals are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that cause an array of issues with Everything within a two-mile radius of where we sprayed and to say that we can treat all these plants with these chemicals and there's no side effects to us,
[03:05:42.780 --> 03:05:55.399]  the human population, that will later consume those chemicals in our food sources when it's wreaking havoc on the ecosystem of the animals in that ecosystem is pretty, I think...
[03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.510]  Radical.
[03:05:56.649 --> 03:06:00.309]  It's pretty naive to think that there's not a consequence or a price to be paid.
[03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:04.909]  And there's never really been any in-depth research into these things.
[03:06:05.069 --> 03:06:07.110]  It's like we set parameters around it.
[03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:14.489]  And what research has been done has traditionally been funded by the people who have the most to gain by continuing down this current path.
[03:06:15.579 --> 03:06:24.319]  Max Keiser has an analogy based on a true historic event that happened because he was working on Wall Street, big stockbroker on 9-11, but he wasn't in the World Trade Centers.
[03:06:24.920 --> 03:06:26.180]  And you can pull up these articles.
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:29.000]  It's called Suicide Bankers or Suicide Traders.
[03:06:29.319 --> 03:06:30.659]  A bunch of articles got written about it.
[03:06:31.290 --> 03:06:36.649]  One tower had already fallen, but they were in the other tower in all the chaos making so much money.
[03:06:36.969 --> 03:06:40.590]  And some of them made 15, 20, 30, 40 million dollars that day their family got.
[03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:45.870]  They stayed at their computers, even though they knew they were probably going to die, because they couldn't help but make the money.
[03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:49.440]  And I know a lot of people in only 30 years.
[03:06:49.579 --> 03:06:51.440]  I know a bunch of billionaires' kids.
[03:06:51.639 --> 03:06:52.600]  I read the statistics.
[03:06:52.739 --> 03:06:54.059]  They have the highest levels of suicide.
[03:06:54.479 --> 03:06:55.719]  They're hurt by the chemicals.
[03:06:56.399 --> 03:06:58.719]  You look at these billionaires, like half their kids are transgender.
[03:06:59.459 --> 03:07:00.840]  It's not just a stylish thing.
[03:07:01.139 --> 03:07:03.239]  It's the chemicals that are leaning them towards that.
[03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:04.459]  So I'm not attacking them.
[03:07:04.719 --> 03:07:08.940]  But the point is that the globalists are all being destroyed by this evil as well.
[03:07:09.299 --> 03:07:20.319]  I mean, they've got all this money and power, but they've screwed over society and done all of this, and they're creating this civilization-collapsing events, like Means talked about in the earlier video, and they're just acting like it's no big deal.
[03:07:21.159 --> 03:07:28.799]  Well, if you look at it logically, and chronic disease continues to climb, and the cost of care in this country continues to climb.
[03:07:28.959 --> 03:07:30.399]  I said that in my Senate speech.
[03:07:31.299 --> 03:07:36.239]  It's the second biggest budgetary concern to the United States at 24% of the US budget.
[03:07:36.559 --> 03:07:40.360]  It's the number one reason for bankruptcy in this country for an individual.
[03:07:40.700 --> 03:07:43.799]  It's the top budgetary concern for most states.
[03:07:44.700 --> 03:08:00.940]  And what's happening is our population is getting more and more chronically ill, more and more obese, more and more metabolic disease, cancer, all of the chronic diseases, the four horsemen that are killing mankind, are at all-time highs with no end in sight.
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:07.079]  And at the same time, we have a diminishing amount of primary cares that are our frontline defense to help these people.
[03:08:07.430 --> 03:08:11.750]  And that's why I truly believe we have to get proactive and predictive.
[03:08:12.069 --> 03:08:14.950]  There is hope, but hope does not come in the form of a bottle.
[03:08:15.370 --> 03:08:21.309]  Hope comes in the form of understanding and having knowledge, taking action and moving forward.
[03:08:21.549 --> 03:08:29.889]  And I believe in giving patients and their clinicians the autonomy to drive their own healthcare and to help get proactive and preventative.
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:33.719]  But in this existing ecosystem, that's just not possible.
[03:08:33.959 --> 03:08:42.659]  And that's why I implore people to move to a cash pay model for preventative care, because it's really truly the only way you're going to get good care.
[03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:51.879]  I like to say, if you live the average American diet, and you see the average American primary care, you can expect to die of the average American chronic disease.
[03:08:53.719 --> 03:08:58.959]  Explain what the cash pay model is because you've got a whole bunch of companies and businesses in healthcare.
[03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:05.739]  I mean, you're an independent mogul at this or, you know, Titan at it for people that don't know who you are.
[03:09:06.139 --> 03:09:10.399]  Explain with all your knowledge what a cash pay is versus the regular system.
[03:09:10.579 --> 03:09:15.659]  Yeah, so what I was breaking down earlier was being behind the scenes, being behind the curtain.
[03:09:15.819 --> 03:09:21.540]  Truthfully, the insurance companies bully and intimidate your clinician from being able to pull comprehensive blood work.
[03:09:22.319 --> 03:09:23.479]  If we can't...
[03:09:23.479 --> 03:09:26.700]  One of the things I also said in front of this in it, to treat...
[03:09:27.370 --> 03:09:30.110]  To diagnose a chronic disease, you first have to take a look.
[03:09:30.329 --> 03:09:32.190]  That's like hooking a computer up to a modern car.
[03:09:32.409 --> 03:09:35.450]  Imagine if you took your new car in and they don't even hook a computer up to check the problem.
[03:09:35.729 --> 03:09:37.649]  The blood is where it's the same.
[03:09:37.870 --> 03:09:39.389]  A computer is actually scanned.
[03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:40.889]  I mean, you're checking what's happening.
[03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:44.790]  The chronic disease that manifests in your 40s started in your 20s.
[03:09:45.090 --> 03:09:47.850]  We're good to go.
[03:09:51.510 --> 03:10:00.690]  We're good to go.
[03:10:05.819 --> 03:10:18.399]  We're good to go.
[03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:26.000]  Or clinician is going to do a deep dive into you at the biological level.
[03:10:26.139 --> 03:10:28.239]  They're gonna review over 70 biomarkers.
[03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:31.239]  Typically, I recommend getting a DEXA and a VO2 max.
[03:10:31.440 --> 03:10:39.459]  If you get a DEXA scan, we know how much lean muscle mass you have, how much visceral fat you have, where you're storing muscle versus where you're storing the fat.
[03:10:39.659 --> 03:10:42.399]  Is that organ fat or is that fat subcutaneous?
[03:10:42.639 --> 03:10:46.159]  That's important because that increases your risk factor of heart attack and stroke.
[03:10:46.549 --> 03:10:53.530]  A VO2 max tells us your overall heart health and lung capacity and where you're trending.
[03:10:53.850 --> 03:11:00.510]  And using these tools in your 20s, 30s, and 40s allow us to truly get proactive and predictive.
[03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:06.250]  It's all genetic and you're We're actually looking to see people are all different, what type you are.
[03:11:06.530 --> 03:11:15.250]  We want to know your genetics, your unique biology, where you're trending with that biology, and with those tools, we can truly prevent chronic disease.
[03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:18.010]  And by the way, this is what all the elites and rich people do.
[03:11:18.209 --> 03:11:19.549]  They all know this full well.
[03:11:20.010 --> 03:11:24.229]  Yeah, because they know, and this is studied, and this is academia, Harvard, everyone will say.
[03:11:24.409 --> 03:11:30.250]  The difference between dying at the average American age of, I think, 72 now, it's actually moving backwards.
[03:11:30.250 --> 03:11:32.850]  It's for the first time in the history of the United States.
[03:11:32.930 --> 03:11:37.190]  The age of death is getting younger, unfortunately.
[03:11:37.510 --> 03:11:44.889]  But we know the difference between somebody who dies of the average American age and lives to be a centenarian is the onset of chronic disease.
[03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:48.409]  So the best thing we can do today to prevent...
[03:11:49.939 --> 03:11:55.600]  Dying prematurely or even at the average American lifespan is to prevent the onset of chronic disease.
[03:11:55.899 --> 03:11:56.680]  And how do you do that?
[03:11:56.780 --> 03:12:05.020]  You do that by getting proactive and predictive by actually pulling the tools out of the tool belt that we can utilize when not in an insurance framework.
[03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:10.299]  The challenge your primary care and the insurance model will have is every tool gets denied.
[03:12:10.790 --> 03:12:12.309]  I want to pull comprehensive blood work.
[03:12:12.430 --> 03:12:12.709]  No.
[03:12:13.430 --> 03:12:20.469]  Even with opioids, the opioid crisis was created partially because the insurance companies wouldn't cover non-addictive, non-abusive pain creams.
[03:12:20.610 --> 03:12:24.889]  Instead, they pushed you to OxyContin and then they wouldn't allow blood work.
[03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:27.530]  I mean, sorry, toxicology screenings.
[03:12:27.790 --> 03:12:52.989]  So one of the measures we have in place to avoid addiction and diversion We're good to go.
[03:12:53.530 --> 03:13:01.629]  On the genetic level, in a cytochrome P450 variance, can tell us how you'll metabolize a lot of the drugs that are on the marketplace.
[03:13:01.829 --> 03:13:05.909]  So we could tell you, Alex, this drug won't even work with your genome type.
[03:13:06.030 --> 03:13:07.530]  You won't absorb this drug.
[03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:15.809]  Like, 23% of patients can't absorb opioids, but they used opioids as a frontline defense for chronic pain, which is just ludicrous.
[03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:24.469]  And we could systematically go through for hours the challenges of the broken system, but I think the data and the The statistics speak for themselves.
[03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:27.829]  Like we said, you can tell by just looking at the state of the union.
[03:13:27.829 --> 03:13:30.569]  Well, let me ask you then to just guesstimate or dead reckon.
[03:13:31.290 --> 03:13:35.530]  You're dialed into alternative medicine, mainline medicine, big pharma.
[03:13:35.729 --> 03:13:36.809]  You're knowing all the things you know.
[03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:40.190]  With this giant awakening, people seeing the death all around them.
[03:13:40.770 --> 03:13:42.829]  All these exposés coming out.
[03:13:43.270 --> 03:13:44.790]  I don't see how they reverse this.
[03:13:44.790 --> 03:13:46.409]  I want to play this clip first of RFK Jr.
[03:13:46.430 --> 03:13:47.129]  I've talked about a bunch.
[03:13:48.209 --> 03:13:49.969]  Talking about Bill Gates and him being indicted.
[03:13:50.649 --> 03:13:51.450]  I mean...
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:54.780]  Davos had its big meeting earlier this year.
[03:13:54.879 --> 03:13:55.879]  They said, everybody hates us.
[03:13:55.940 --> 03:13:56.659]  We don't have any trust.
[03:13:56.879 --> 03:13:58.360]  The Clinton Foundation admits that.
[03:13:58.719 --> 03:14:04.700]  And their response is, and Bill Gates has been saying this, we'll just have AI censor everybody in live time and not let you question us.
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:06.559]  He actually says that.
[03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:09.459]  We're not going to let you question what we're doing.
[03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:11.239]  I played a report earlier where he said that.
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:13.340]  So their answer is more tyranny.
[03:14:13.559 --> 03:14:15.500]  I see that backfiring on them.
[03:14:15.559 --> 03:14:17.139]  Here's Bill Gates, then we'll get your take on this.
[03:14:18.239 --> 03:14:22.059]  And I read an article from the New York Times.
[03:14:23.219 --> 03:14:29.860]  That Bill Gates had just donated $50 million to Kamala Harris' campaign.
[03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:43.440]  And the article said that it was the first donation that he's made in 20 years.
[03:14:44.360 --> 03:14:46.579]  That he stayed out of politics.
[03:14:46.899 --> 03:14:48.399]  That he's been bipartisan.
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:52.559]  It was a dark money donation.
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:56.079]  He didn't intend for it to be public.
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:11.559]  He routed the donation through a 501, which was an organization that was set up to conceal large money donations to the Harris campaign.
[03:15:18.020 --> 03:15:23.219]  He said, when the Times asked him, he said he had donated zero.
[03:15:24.430 --> 03:15:31.370]  In the 2020 campaign when President Biden was running against President Trump.
[03:15:32.850 --> 03:15:37.110]  And he said this campaign is different than any other.
[03:15:38.129 --> 03:15:40.870]  And so he felt the need to do this now.
[03:15:41.649 --> 03:15:47.450]  Do you think Bill Gates made that donation out of a patriotic impulse?
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:56.059]  Do you think he made it out of a humanitarian impulse?
[03:15:56.520 --> 03:16:02.579]  Do you think he made it because he wants global health?
[03:16:04.819 --> 03:16:08.040]  Or because he wants to make America healthy again?
[03:16:11.579 --> 03:16:35.709]  Well, there was something else, another article about Bill Gates that came out today that said he has just been indicted He's been indicted in the Netherlands for lying to the public about the COVID vaccine.
[03:16:46.409 --> 03:16:48.430]  And he's going to have to go to trial.
[03:16:51.709 --> 03:16:56.510]  You think that he wants to go to trial here in the United States of America?
[03:16:59.590 --> 03:17:05.170]  You think maybe that's one of the reasons he chose to give $50 million to Kamala Harris?
[03:17:09.129 --> 03:17:13.450]  So this broadcast is the hottest political moment ever in my 30 years on air.
[03:17:13.729 --> 03:17:16.549]  Everybody agrees it's the biggest, most important election in world history.
[03:17:16.750 --> 03:17:18.909]  It's a referendum on freedom versus tyranny.
[03:17:19.969 --> 03:17:21.129]  And this is a perfect time.
[03:17:21.250 --> 03:17:28.129]  I'm glad we scheduled this weeks ago for now, because the health issue really is the most important, and it's right at the center of everything.
[03:17:28.290 --> 03:17:31.110]  And it's what's going to galvanize left and right and transcend.
[03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:33.790]  And Trump's the only one Big Pharma's shooting at.
[03:17:33.969 --> 03:17:36.750]  Even though he's made mistakes, they still know they don't own him and control him.
[03:17:37.090 --> 03:17:42.469]  We'll talk about that in the battle once he gets in, because they're starting to realize there's no way they're going to stop him unless they kill him.
[03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:45.270]  But the earlier question before I played the clip, Brigham...
[03:17:46.649 --> 03:17:49.090]  What do you think Big Pharma is going to do now, the big insurance companies?
[03:17:49.149 --> 03:17:51.670]  What are they going to do when the jig's up?
[03:17:52.489 --> 03:17:53.350]  You know, it's fascinating.
[03:17:53.430 --> 03:17:57.170]  There's a lot of levers that Big Pharma can pull, and I've learned the hard way.
[03:17:57.690 --> 03:18:06.129]  They have a pretty good stronghold on the FDA, and a large portion, like I said earlier, 50% of the FDA's funding comes from Big Pharma.
[03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:16.149]  I definitely believe that Big Pharma does not want Trump and Bobby Kennedy in power because it's not good for that machine.
[03:18:16.930 --> 03:18:19.870]  I mean, right now, you know, the...
[03:18:20.869 --> 03:18:39.350]  I don't know if you're aware, the FDA attempted to say that GLP-1s, they're technically diabetes medications that are being marketed as weight loss drugs, but GLP-1s disproportionately help poverty-stricken and minority communities because diabetes disproportionately impacts those communities.
[03:18:39.790 --> 03:18:42.469]  And it's not readily available in this country.
[03:18:42.549 --> 03:18:57.930]  And I actually have a clip that we made about it, but it's not available because Lilly and some of these companies have their own facilities getting shut down, and the way they've marketed these products, they're being used for weight loss by everyone and their mom across the country, and it's hard for the people,
[03:18:58.069 --> 03:19:01.190]  the diabetics, that really need this medicine to get this medicine.
[03:19:01.629 --> 03:19:11.350]  And so you would think that we would want to make sure that compounding pharmacies and the lifeblood of You know, our pharmaceutical interventions in this country were protected.
[03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:18.030]  In fact, the FDA asked compounding pharmacies to make these compounds for the American people because of the back order.
[03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:25.670]  And what happens is as soon as these big pharmaceutical companies begin to pressure the FDA, the FDA oftentimes caves.
[03:19:25.829 --> 03:19:26.930]  And that happened a few weeks ago.
[03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:33.909]  The FDA caved and said, we're going to immediately remove GLP-1s from the backlog list, but it's still on a backlog across the country.
[03:19:34.260 --> 03:19:42.799]  The reason that's important is that means diabetics and poverty-stricken communities and people who can't get to these medicines would not have accessibility.
[03:19:43.299 --> 03:19:57.620]  In an effort to prevent that, several compounding pharmacies sued the FDA. And within four days, the FDA reneged on its original statement and put it back on the backlogs list, meaning compounding pharmacies could compound and bring it to the American people.
[03:19:57.860 --> 03:19:59.500]  So the bottom line is we need to push back.
[03:19:59.739 --> 03:20:02.319]  Yes, but I say that because I want the public to know.
[03:20:02.520 --> 03:20:03.840]  Big Pharma's slick.
[03:20:04.079 --> 03:20:05.440]  A lot of people don't know this.
[03:20:05.540 --> 03:20:16.579]  Big Pharma already submitted a new petition within days using their powerhouse attorneys trying to now reclassify GLP-1s as dangerous to compound.
[03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:30.600]  And they are leaning heavily on the FDA to shut down the ability of compounding pharmacies to make this lifetime Not just life-changing, life-saving compound inaccessible to the American people.
[03:20:30.739 --> 03:20:32.520]  And they did this in the 80s.
[03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:35.139]  So again, if we look at it, where is it headed?
[03:20:35.180 --> 03:20:37.219]  I go back to where has it been?
[03:20:37.579 --> 03:20:39.959]  History is doomed to repeat itself.
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:42.659]  How about these people get indicted and charged with murder?
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:43.940]  I mean, I'm really...
[03:20:43.940 --> 03:20:44.819]  They're killing us.
[03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:45.540]  And it's disgusting.
[03:20:45.659 --> 03:20:48.780]  And then meanwhile, speaking of precision, it's like, Trump's gonna kill us with the weapons.
[03:20:48.940 --> 03:20:51.739]  He's gonna kill women, kill us, kill us, kill us.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.219]  And then he's Hitler and just it's all...
[03:20:54.879 --> 03:20:58.360]  Well, yeah, who's killing us are these big pharmaceutical companies.
[03:20:58.520 --> 03:21:21.270]  If you go back to the 80s, we talked about hemophilia drugs and knowingly impacting patients with HIV. But the other thing that Big Pharma did in the 80s, after knowingly infecting people with HIV, this is all documented and factual, Big Pharma sued HIV. All compounding pharmacies and all of the generic pharmacies that were attempting to make cost-effective HIV treatments.
[03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:25.170]  Because in the 80s, an HIV treatment was $14,000 a month.
[03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:27.850]  And the people of Africa could not afford these treatments.
[03:21:28.270 --> 03:21:31.709]  There were pharmacies out there trying to make those drugs for a couple hundred dollars.
[03:21:31.709 --> 03:21:32.409]  Stay there, Brigham Mueller.
[03:21:33.010 --> 03:21:34.110]  We'll finish up with this.
[03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:34.709]  This is amazing.
[03:21:35.260 --> 03:21:46.379]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[03:21:46.659 --> 03:21:47.879]  And we've come out with it.
[03:21:48.319 --> 03:21:53.159]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[03:21:53.299 --> 03:21:54.840]  But I personally like this one.
[03:21:55.399 --> 03:22:00.120]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[03:22:00.549 --> 03:22:03.170]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.
[03:22:03.549 --> 03:22:13.389]  So get yours right now and a bunch of other great designs of hoodies and t-shirts and top of the line supplements that all fund the second American Revolution at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:22:13.489 --> 03:22:14.350]  Let me show you a few more of these.
[03:22:14.549 --> 03:22:23.549]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats and it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[03:22:23.819 --> 03:22:32.079]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out, and we've got the Save the Frogs, over 50 designs, all at thealexshowstore.com, and it keeps us on air, and it spreads the word.
[03:22:32.239 --> 03:22:34.719]  Please go to alexshowstore.com and get your Patriot gear.
[03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:42.180]  Here's Brigham Bueller from Ways to Well, ways2well.com, talking about the Eli Lilly situation he just mentioned.
[03:22:42.260 --> 03:22:43.319]  Then we're going to go big picture.
[03:22:44.040 --> 03:22:47.780]  If Trump gets in, which more and more it looks like he will, they're going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[03:22:48.459 --> 03:22:58.239]  And we're already seeing jockeying behind the scenes to bring in the bureaucracy, and the swamp's going to fight for its life, try to block Trump, and, you know, Kennedy actually getting the job done.
[03:22:58.459 --> 03:23:01.020]  You've got a lot of the inside baseball on that, but Trump's also talked about it.
[03:23:01.059 --> 03:23:02.239]  We'll hit that in a moment, but first, here's a club.
[03:23:03.229 --> 03:23:14.329]  So imagine a world where you've captured not only the media outlets that report the news, but also the regulatory bodies that control what products reach the marketplace and when.
[03:23:14.590 --> 03:23:23.590]  And at the drop of a hat, you can flip a switch and turn off the national drug supply of crucial life-saving products like these diabetes medications.
[03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:26.229]  That's 100% what Eli Lilly is doing.
[03:23:26.600 --> 03:23:38.399]  Eli Lilly got exposed, not by the FDA, by a whistleblower for its violations and egregious behavior at most of its manufacturing facilities.
[03:23:38.719 --> 03:23:42.120]  And the only major media source that covered this is Reuters.
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:51.239]  So let's talk about what the whistleblower claims and what the FDA actually found at a very specific Eli Lilly facility.
[03:23:51.489 --> 03:23:56.229]  Improper aseptic techniques for filing undisclosed drugs that were deficient.
[03:23:56.329 --> 03:24:00.370]  Processing areas for two or more filling lines were substandard.
[03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:05.409]  Sanitization procedures did not meet FDA standards.
[03:24:05.690 --> 03:24:13.770]  A lot of these big pharmaceutical companies will literally destroy evidence of its shortcomings before the FDA can come in and inspect.
[03:24:13.969 --> 03:24:18.270]  Bobby Kennedy and the Maha movement is the reason that we're having these discussions today.
[03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:32.360]  And I just hope that we can have an enlightening conversation with the FDA in the near future to try and get answers on to why it's constantly the American people and the public paying the price for the pocketbooks of Big Pharma.
[03:24:35.729 --> 03:24:36.090]  Wow.
[03:24:36.090 --> 03:24:39.069]  Well, Brigham Bueller, you are definitely fighting the New World Order.
[03:24:39.170 --> 03:24:40.170]  You're testifying to Senate.
[03:24:40.270 --> 03:24:41.190]  You're all over the news.
[03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:45.870]  And people, you know, the big pharma comes after folks like you that do this, but you're standing up.
[03:24:45.969 --> 03:24:48.350]  You're showing courage, and courage is contagious.
[03:24:48.629 --> 03:24:50.690]  You were explaining to me during that clip why it's so important.
[03:24:51.020 --> 03:25:02.059]  Yeah, the reason it's important and the reason I wanted to expose what did happen with some of these manufacturing facilities is because a lot of people are under the false impression if it's an FDA-approved product, it's safe.
[03:25:02.799 --> 03:25:07.000]  And if it comes from Big Pharma, it's safer than alternatives.
[03:25:07.219 --> 03:25:16.959]  And Big Pharma uses its media branch To try and portray compounding pharmacies as dangerous or an inappropriate way to get your medications.
[03:25:17.479 --> 03:25:28.819]  But the truth of the matter is, in the big pharmaceutical industries, over 2500 manufacturing facilities have not been investigated by the FDA in five or more years.
[03:25:29.159 --> 03:25:31.860]  Well, isn't most of big pharma like in the Philippines and China and places?
[03:25:31.860 --> 03:25:32.159]  Got it.
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:34.739]  They're moving a lot of their manufacturings overseas.
[03:25:34.959 --> 03:25:36.579]  And the reason is, think about this.
[03:25:36.659 --> 03:25:47.139]  If I'm an FDA investigator, I now have to file for a visa or file to travel into that location and get approval to come tour your facility in India.
[03:25:47.459 --> 03:25:52.040]  Oftentimes, they put these facilities in rural areas that are hard to get to.
[03:25:52.219 --> 03:25:59.190]  There's actually a book called Bottle of Lies where an investigative journalist does It goes deep down the rabbit hole to break all this down.
[03:25:59.590 --> 03:26:07.930]  And so we created that video because Eli Lilly attempted to push a narrative that compounding pharmacies are dangerous, and they've taken it a step further.
[03:26:08.110 --> 03:26:24.290]  Lilly and these big pharmaceutical companies, since they can't get these drugs off the backlogs list because they are backlogged and Americans cannot get to them, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have now filed to put them on a dangerous to compound list.
[03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:25.930]  Now, don't be fooled by this.
[03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:30.090]  These medications have been being compounded for the last three years.
[03:26:30.610 --> 03:26:36.290]  And compounds are literally the lifeblood of most crash carts in hospital systems.
[03:26:36.629 --> 03:26:39.450]  Big Pharma ignores crash carts because there's no profit in it.
[03:26:39.569 --> 03:26:44.829]  So most of the items on a crash cart at a hospital that save your life come from these compounding pharma.
[03:26:44.829 --> 03:26:45.110]  Let's be clear.
[03:26:45.209 --> 03:26:48.889]  They're getting all the old drugs and even new drugs that are good aren't available.
[03:26:48.989 --> 03:26:49.709]  They don't make them.
[03:26:49.790 --> 03:26:51.350]  Now they want to stop other people from making them.
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:51.680]  Correct.
[03:26:51.940 --> 03:26:53.520]  And they're even doing that with peptides.
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:57.600]  Like, there was a big ban on peptides that I talked about on Rogan.
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:00.399]  They got added to a dangerous list out of the blue.
[03:27:00.959 --> 03:27:02.280]  Nobody knew this was coming.
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:05.440]  It was just a rapid-sweeping FDA change.
[03:27:05.559 --> 03:27:14.739]  And when you look behind the curtain, it's because they're acting on bad data and bad information handed to them by Big Pharma.
[03:27:14.840 --> 03:27:16.700]  And Big Pharma's been coming up for supplements forever.
[03:27:16.879 --> 03:27:19.780]  I mean, they're trying to say vitamin C's bad stuff and tumor.
[03:27:19.940 --> 03:27:20.440]  Correct.
[03:27:21.010 --> 03:27:21.489]  All of it.
[03:27:22.069 --> 03:27:44.950]  My point is, just like I'm saying with Big Food, we have to fight back as citizens, as civilians, and we have to have our voice united, or they're going to push their agenda and bully and intimidate the FDA. And that is where I'm excited about somebody like Bobby Kennedy potentially being in a position of power to help stop the corruption and collusion.
[03:27:45.090 --> 03:27:55.680]  And let's be clear, Trump has pledged that He's got a bunch of other good people coming in, but it's coming out that the same Washington forces that tried to pack his cabinet and the agencies are in there right now.
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:01.479]  So I don't want to put the cart before the horse and say Trump's already in on January 21st, but it looks like that's probably going to happen.
[03:28:01.620 --> 03:28:07.799]  The deep state's going to fight it, but the real fight's going to start once he's in government to hold the bureaucracy's feet to the fire.
[03:28:08.750 --> 03:28:16.290]  Yeah, I do know, having got to know RFK and gotten to know Tulsi Gabbard, I consider them friends.
[03:28:16.409 --> 03:28:23.049]  I think they're highly intelligent, high-integrity individuals that really, truly want to help the average American.
[03:28:23.790 --> 03:28:39.350]  But as we look at this machine move into position, I would think it would be naive to not expect The opposition to rally, and if they do lose, to try to see if they can't at least get a win by who's put into positions on these cabinets.
[03:28:39.350 --> 03:28:40.170]  It'll be interesting.
[03:28:40.489 --> 03:28:51.250]  And Trump talked about how they would lie to him, and the Republican Party told him, oh, put these people in, they'll do your agenda, but instead, he would sign executive orders, they'd throw them away in the trash can if they didn't like what Trump was doing.
[03:28:51.450 --> 03:28:53.010]  So it's a big fight.
[03:28:53.229 --> 03:28:53.690]  That's wild.
[03:28:54.549 --> 03:28:56.530]  I mean, absolutely.
[03:28:57.569 --> 03:28:59.909]  Getting Trump in is just the start of the real war.
[03:29:02.670 --> 03:29:08.649]  Looking at Kamala Harris being a chicken and not going on Joe Rogan right now, Trump's in there taping with Joe, it should be out soon.
[03:29:12.329 --> 03:29:17.930]  What do you make of just watching this as a citizen, all this insanity of this campaign?
[03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:26.540]  What's odd to me is, you know, I mean, Joe told me on Monday that Kamala had asked to come on, and Joe's not biased.
[03:29:26.739 --> 03:29:27.899]  Joe's an open-minded guy.
[03:29:27.899 --> 03:29:43.139]  He's willing to give anyone opportunity, and so I just found it odd that then she canceled, you know, on the podcast, and the media portrayed it as Joe invited her and she declined, but, you know, that's not what I was told by, you know, my contacts.
[03:29:43.659 --> 03:29:44.280]  She was...
[03:29:44.979 --> 03:29:50.000]  She had accepted and things were full steam ahead and for whatever reason they changed their mind.
[03:29:50.799 --> 03:29:51.739]  So that's interesting.
[03:29:51.959 --> 03:29:52.799]  I don't know.
[03:29:52.899 --> 03:29:55.299]  I have no insight into the why behind that.
[03:29:55.799 --> 03:29:56.360]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[03:29:56.440 --> 03:29:57.540]  I mean, Joe didn't want to be political.
[03:29:57.639 --> 03:29:58.620]  He wanted to have them both on.
[03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:00.559]  So Trump was getting set up.
[03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:02.340]  The Harris people knew about it.
[03:30:02.420 --> 03:30:03.239]  They wanted on.
[03:30:03.500 --> 03:30:05.059]  And then I guess they got cold feet.
[03:30:05.859 --> 03:30:06.219]  Correct.
[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:09.319]  So Trump still goes on and now Kamala doesn't.
[03:30:09.620 --> 03:30:09.760]  Yeah.
[03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:13.620]  And Joe's show's always gigantic, but this thing, I've not seen this much interest.
[03:30:13.739 --> 03:30:14.659]  I mean, it's going to be a...
[03:30:14.659 --> 03:30:17.000]  I mean, the Musk interview with Trump got...
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:20.840]  It was two and a half hours long, got a billion people clicked it and at least watched some of it.
[03:30:21.180 --> 03:30:22.459]  Hundreds of millions watched the whole thing.
[03:30:22.899 --> 03:30:23.840]  I think this is going to...
[03:30:23.840 --> 03:30:25.799]  This will hands down be the biggest podcast.
[03:30:26.760 --> 03:30:28.139]  Rogan's ever done, maybe the biggest ever.
[03:30:28.219 --> 03:30:29.100]  I mean, I bet...
[03:30:29.100 --> 03:30:32.799]  I bet on all the platforms he's on, I would conservatively bet...
[03:30:33.939 --> 03:30:38.319]  By Monday, it's been seen 200 million times, and clips of it, you won't even be able to count.
[03:30:38.379 --> 03:30:40.020]  It'll be on every channel, every show.
[03:30:40.739 --> 03:30:49.500]  I mean, look, I covered the Musk-Trump interview and simulcasted it, and we had like 15 million viewers on that on one feed.
[03:30:49.600 --> 03:30:52.120]  That's not counting the billion that watched it on Musk's actual feed.
[03:30:52.280 --> 03:30:54.680]  And there were thousands of other people that covered it.
[03:30:54.700 --> 03:30:56.219]  I couldn't even keep track of it with huge views, too.
[03:30:56.479 --> 03:30:58.000]  They probably had a billion and a half views.
[03:30:58.120 --> 03:30:58.440]  I mean...
[03:31:00.409 --> 03:31:02.469]  There's Trump's motorcade driving by.
[03:31:02.629 --> 03:31:03.409]  Is that just now?
[03:31:03.610 --> 03:31:04.469]  Or was that earlier?
[03:31:06.709 --> 03:31:08.170]  Okay, so Trump's not even there yet.
[03:31:08.190 --> 03:31:08.909]  He got there late.
[03:31:09.409 --> 03:31:11.149]  That is our office right there.
[03:31:11.829 --> 03:31:14.309]  That's right out the back door there.
[03:31:14.489 --> 03:31:15.709]  So Trump's driving by right now.
[03:31:15.930 --> 03:31:17.870]  I wonder why the crew thought it'd even be out there.
[03:31:18.129 --> 03:31:18.430]  Whatever.
[03:31:19.129 --> 03:31:20.590]  So people have asked why they had Trump on.
[03:31:20.649 --> 03:31:26.190]  I could get Trump on, but I've looked at the calculus and all the demonization in me.
[03:31:27.920 --> 03:31:29.319]  Yeah.
[03:31:44.270 --> 03:31:48.290]  When you're the super black sheep, it's got its benefits, but also it's not...
[03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:55.229]  We've said this, all of us that were at that Senate hearing have talked about, I'm willing to talk to anybody.
[03:31:55.389 --> 03:31:57.370]  I have no agenda here one way or the other.
[03:31:57.489 --> 03:32:05.469]  My agenda is to fight for truth and to try and expose the truth and hopefully find a better pathway forward to prevent chronic disease.
[03:32:06.430 --> 03:32:12.950]  I'm willing to talk to the left, the right, the center, and I think that this problem transcends...
[03:32:14.930 --> 03:32:18.170]  But that's what the globalists want, the corporate media.
[03:32:18.350 --> 03:32:21.389]  They don't want super popular podcasts because it's a real discussion.
[03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:26.909]  They want a canned talking point they put out and all the media spouts it and their candidates spout it to control the larger debate.
[03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:32.290]  The censorship is not just of Alex Jones, folks, or MI6 criminally targeting RFK Jr.
[03:32:32.569 --> 03:32:36.750]  They're targeting you, trying to keep you from having the right to be able to hear other ideas.
[03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:48.079]  That is definitely 100% happening, because I can tell you, again, a less polarizing podcast was Jillian's, and it literally got the algorithm, and it wasn't just me.
[03:32:48.139 --> 03:32:48.600]  It was me.
[03:32:48.659 --> 03:32:49.280]  It was Callie.
[03:32:49.399 --> 03:32:53.760]  It was anybody who talked about big pharma, big medical, big insurance.
[03:32:54.500 --> 03:32:56.379]  It's hard to get your message out there.
[03:32:56.879 --> 03:33:06.569]  You've got to think, when the majority of the advertising dollars on these platforms comes from Big Pharma, you know, $7 billion a year in advertising.
[03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:12.010]  That's a big, big pocketbook and a cash cow that people don't want to miss out on.
[03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:27.290]  And in a capitalist society, which they're trying to phase out, just a corporate crony system, people supporting independent medicine, people supporting independent broadcast, people supporting independent supplement makers, people supporting independent publishers like Skyhorse, that builds the new economy,
[03:33:27.290 --> 03:33:33.590]  which is more popular than And which is beginning to basically replace the old corrupt globalist system.
[03:33:33.690 --> 03:33:34.649]  So that's the revolution.
[03:33:35.170 --> 03:33:39.010]  Moses' revolution is word of mouth and the decisions you make and where you spend your money.
[03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:45.450]  It's not going out and having a shooting war with the UN. It's shooting down the UN treaty to take over your health care.
[03:33:48.699 --> 03:33:49.219]  Yeah.
[03:33:49.219 --> 03:33:51.959]  There's just so many dollars being made off chronic disease.
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:52.920]  I don't know.
[03:33:53.899 --> 03:34:03.899]  The silver lining for me is if this election goes the way you're saying it's going to go, I do really think that if Bobby Kennedy's put in a position to make change, he will.
[03:34:04.059 --> 03:34:20.049]  The things that I've been told is there'd be potentially an executive order to drive forth this sweeping change in healthcare and attempt to We're good to go.
[03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:32.829]  We're good to go.
[03:34:40.850 --> 03:34:41.389]  No, it is.
[03:34:41.469 --> 03:34:59.170]  And if it wasn't for people like Joe, you know, again, when we talk about the inability to get this message out there, if it wasn't for people like Joe, I said this, I had a PR firm that I hired after Big Pharma started its first shady attempt at making life hard for compounding pharmacies in this country.
[03:34:59.569 --> 03:35:02.489]  And the PR firm said, Brigham, I can't help you.
[03:35:02.860 --> 03:35:06.360]  Like, you know, you've got to understand all these media outlets are funded by Big Pharma.
[03:35:06.459 --> 03:35:07.639]  That's their biggest advertiser.
[03:35:07.979 --> 03:35:13.540]  They're not going to want to have a talking head on there that says something contradictory to the narrative.
[03:35:13.559 --> 03:35:20.639]  They've got a stagnant monopoly that wants to get rid of all competition and who wants to be able to push products on us that kill us and make us eat weed killer.
[03:35:20.860 --> 03:35:21.479]  And people are done.
[03:35:21.559 --> 03:35:24.079]  Let me show you these articles getting into general politics and your take on it.
[03:35:25.959 --> 03:35:26.540]  Look at this.
[03:35:26.719 --> 03:35:27.600]  This is the Washington Post.
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:28.020]  Trump...
[03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:37.069]  We're good to go.
[03:35:50.379 --> 03:35:51.540]  At Madison Square Garden.
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:36:03.579]  So because the Nazi Party America in 39 had a rally there, and there's just been thousands of other events there, you know, basketball games, rock stars, hip-hop, you know, the Democrat DNC was there in 92, the RNC in 2004.
[03:36:04.399 --> 03:36:11.780]  The idea that Trump's a Nazi because he's going to speak at Madison Square Garden where Nazis once spoke, I mean, this is desperation.
[03:36:11.959 --> 03:36:13.860]  This is crazy.
[03:36:14.959 --> 03:36:16.120]  What do you make of that, Brigham?
[03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:19.209]  It's the crazy world we're living in.
[03:36:19.690 --> 03:36:20.209]  Yeah.
[03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:21.430]  Here it is.
[03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:24.590]  Hillary Clinton joins in on Trump-Nazi comparisons.
[03:36:24.930 --> 03:36:25.850]  Let's play that clip.
[03:36:25.989 --> 03:36:26.569]  Here's Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:40.809]  And you know, one other thing that you'll see next week, Caitlin, is Trump actually reenacting the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939.
[03:36:40.809 --> 03:36:42.750]  I write about this in my book.
[03:36:43.209 --> 03:36:59.479]  President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-Nazis, fascists in America were lining up to essentially Pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing in Germany.
[03:36:59.860 --> 03:37:02.479]  So, I don't think we can ignore it.
[03:37:02.959 --> 03:37:05.540]  And it's all over every corporate channel.
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:06.840]  What?
[03:37:07.360 --> 03:37:08.639]  I mean, imagine.
[03:37:08.979 --> 03:37:12.799]  So, the Rolling Stones are Nazis because they played very much too, Brigham?
[03:37:15.200 --> 03:37:17.979]  It's also sad, man.
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:25.850]  I really hate that everyone's trying to polarize and weaponize Our media outlets.
[03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:28.930]  I mean, it's hard for people to find truth.
[03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:30.069]  Well, that's a good point.
[03:37:30.409 --> 03:37:36.989]  The Democrats say, turn down the heat, and they're running around saying Trump's literally going to kill us with the military with no evidence.
[03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:39.670]  Why do you think they're so scared of Trump?
[03:37:41.520 --> 03:37:47.360]  I think with all of it, same thing with Bobby Kennedy, it's against the traditional establishment, right?
[03:37:47.479 --> 03:37:57.819]  If we can keep things status quo, then the machine stays alive, and if we disrupt the status quo with independent thinking and free thought, that's a challenge to anything.
[03:37:58.659 --> 03:37:59.260]  And...
[03:38:00.350 --> 03:38:04.510]  Again, with my main focus being healthcare, I just know my space and my lane.
[03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:09.350]  And in that lane, I've seen a lot of this corruption in the healthcare space alone.
[03:38:09.389 --> 03:38:20.750]  So I can't imagine what we're doing with the trillions of dollars to be made in war and the war in the Ukraine and selling weapons and all the different things that we do as a nation.
[03:38:21.389 --> 03:38:22.610]  It's pretty intimidating.
[03:38:23.129 --> 03:38:25.430]  Since you mentioned that, guys, get clip 16.
[03:38:25.729 --> 03:38:28.010]  Everybody's made this point, but this guy makes it in 29 seconds.
[03:38:28.620 --> 03:38:30.920]  Five presidents, ten wars, zero charges.
[03:38:31.239 --> 03:38:34.459]  One president, zero wars, 78 charges.
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:36.479]  Are you awake yet?
[03:38:36.600 --> 03:38:37.159]  Here it is.
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:38.879]  You get it yet?
[03:38:39.219 --> 03:38:43.340]  Five presidents, ten wars, zero charges.
[03:38:44.079 --> 03:38:50.420]  One president, zero wars, 78 charges.
[03:38:51.579 --> 03:38:52.920]  Are you awake yet?
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.840]  Now, talking about me personally, you were talking about this before we went live.
[03:39:06.079 --> 03:39:07.700]  If you want to tell the story, if it's private, you don't have to.
[03:39:07.799 --> 03:39:11.620]  But, you know, the fact is, Joe's always telling me, you got to work out more and you got to get your blood checked.
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:12.819]  You got to go see Brigham and blah, blah, blah.
[03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:15.360]  So I go in there and finally get it done a while back.
[03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:24.280]  And then you look at what I'm taking, what I'm doing supplement-wise, and you guys do a genetic test, and then you say, don't do this, do that.
[03:39:24.819 --> 03:39:27.059]  And it's just been like magic.
[03:39:27.059 --> 03:39:32.079]  I've lost like 28 pounds in just the last two and a half, three months or so.
[03:39:32.159 --> 03:39:33.020]  People can see it.
[03:39:34.739 --> 03:39:36.979]  I mean, you guys, it's really simple.
[03:39:37.059 --> 03:39:42.860]  And I've gone before and had my blood tested by other medical systems and clinics, and they don't really look at the same things.
[03:39:44.310 --> 03:39:44.850]  What's different?
[03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:46.129]  Because, you know, you're not a sponsor.
[03:39:46.250 --> 03:39:46.870]  Maybe you will be on the road.
[03:39:46.930 --> 03:39:48.930]  But the point is, I wanted to put this on screen to help people.
[03:39:49.170 --> 03:39:50.049]  You just came up with this.
[03:39:50.149 --> 03:39:50.690]  It's very nice of you.
[03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:53.329]  Ways2Well, just W-A-Y-S, the number two.
[03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:56.090]  Well, ways2well.com.
[03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:58.170]  Promo code Alex for 10% off.
[03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:59.649]  Comprehensive blood work.
[03:39:59.750 --> 03:40:01.750]  Tell people how you guys are different.
[03:40:01.969 --> 03:40:09.350]  Well, the difference is in the traditional medical establishment, like I was saying earlier, the panels are controlled by the insurance companies.
[03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:13.950]  But then the other challenge is the assessment tool is based off a sick patient population.
[03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:17.389]  We've been talking this whole time about how chronically ill Americans are.
[03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:25.489]  The blood work done in a traditional primary care practice in this country looks at you, a patient demographic of 18 to 70 something years old.
[03:40:25.879 --> 03:40:28.420]  And it's a sick American patient population to begin with.
[03:40:28.520 --> 03:40:31.940]  Like I said, the average American's on, I think, four more drugs over a certain age.
[03:40:32.100 --> 03:40:39.079]  And we look at that and go, we narrow those parameters down to where were we as a healthy 20 to 25 year old?
[03:40:39.239 --> 03:40:46.139]  In the peak of our lives, where were all of these 70 plus biomarkers and what is an optimal level?
[03:40:46.360 --> 03:40:50.540]  Because I never went into, you know, life saying I wanna be normal.
[03:40:51.090 --> 03:40:51.829]  I don't want to be normal.
[03:40:51.989 --> 03:40:52.790]  I want to be optimal.
[03:40:53.409 --> 03:40:54.629]  And the bar keeps getting lower.
[03:40:54.690 --> 03:40:55.309]  We're living less.
[03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:55.930]  We're sicker.
[03:40:56.530 --> 03:41:05.489]  And so if we base our sample size off a sick patient population and we treat you like a sick patient population, we shouldn't be shocked when we head towards a sick population.
[03:41:06.090 --> 03:41:06.450]  Patient.
[03:41:06.909 --> 03:41:12.729]  Whereas at Ways to Well, our focus is getting proactive and predictive in using these tools in our tool belt.
[03:41:12.829 --> 03:41:25.889]  Because we're not in an insurance-based model, we're able to work hand in hand with the patient to take sovereignty and accountability over your health and use every tool we have at our fingertips to drive your health span and longevity.
[03:41:26.350 --> 03:41:37.190]  And we can do an array, a battery of tests that just aren't really available in traditional medicine Because insurance won't cover it, not because your doctor doesn't necessarily want to do it.
[03:41:37.569 --> 03:41:39.270]  It's more that their hands are tied.
[03:41:39.770 --> 03:41:44.489]  So by taking the leash off, we're able to do those deep dives, spend the time with a patient.
[03:41:44.909 --> 03:41:54.510]  45 minutes on average is what a ways-to-well provider spends, just trying to educate and embolden and empower patients to drive their healthcare.
[03:41:55.879 --> 03:41:56.680]  Well, I'm excited.
[03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:00.979]  The fact that I'm getting back in better shape has become kind of a news item.
[03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:04.239]  And it's you guys and some other guys getting on me.
[03:42:04.399 --> 03:42:05.739]  The transformation's crazy.
[03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:08.100]  I think I saw you about a month ago.
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:08.979]  It's wild.
[03:42:09.180 --> 03:42:09.979]  It's just wild.
[03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:15.299]  I can't wait until the Joe Rogan Trump interview drops.
[03:42:15.719 --> 03:42:16.739]  It's happening right now.
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:19.100]  Drive over there and see Joe.
[03:42:20.100 --> 03:42:21.600]  I'm told it's a pretty big circus over there.
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:22.659]  I was talking to some of the guys earlier.
[03:42:23.879 --> 03:42:26.180]  But in closing here, folks...
[03:42:26.819 --> 03:42:30.159]  They're trying to shut us down in, let's put it up, November 13th.
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:31.079]  How many days is that?
[03:42:31.139 --> 03:42:31.760]  18 days?
[03:42:32.559 --> 03:42:33.840]  The judge came out.
[03:42:33.940 --> 03:42:34.559]  It's in Bloomberg.
[03:42:36.139 --> 03:42:44.059]  The feds have attacked themselves to my case, my bankruptcy case, and they've asked to own my name and shut me down.
[03:42:44.059 --> 03:42:46.799]  The judge refused to do that today.
[03:42:46.959 --> 03:42:48.020]  It's pretty sensational.
[03:42:48.379 --> 03:42:50.840]  The media just spun it like it was no big deal.
[03:42:50.879 --> 03:42:51.399]  Here's Bloomberg.
[03:42:52.599 --> 03:42:56.260]  Alex Jones' trustee bid to sell his social media paused by judge.
[03:42:56.379 --> 03:42:58.600]  No, they're saying they own my name, Alex Jones.
[03:42:58.719 --> 03:43:00.079]  Like, I signed a contract like Prince.
[03:43:01.020 --> 03:43:03.659]  You know, because he did sign a deal with a record company that owned his name.
[03:43:03.760 --> 03:43:04.579]  Nobody owns my name.
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:07.899]  The judge said, you've got to show proof of this, so he announced a hearing, but...
[03:43:09.059 --> 03:43:16.200]  They're only trying to sell my name at this auction coming up that's been ordered, and the judge may just derail all that because of the power grab.
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:18.000]  That's why I need your support.
[03:43:18.180 --> 03:43:22.420]  It takes money to have lawyers to fight this, and we will beat it.
[03:43:22.459 --> 03:43:23.079]  It's outrageous.
[03:43:23.969 --> 03:43:26.329]  But we've got to fight it in state court, federal court.
[03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:31.129]  So it's not just, oh, support the sponsor, you know, so we have a new studio and the crew has a place to work.
[03:43:31.270 --> 03:43:36.489]  If we get shut down on the 13th, it takes money to then battle the Democrat Party.
[03:43:36.690 --> 03:43:41.190]  So go get t-shirts, go get great supplements at thealexjohnstore.com.
[03:43:41.969 --> 03:43:45.190]  There's a huge sale going right now, 20% off on the discounts already.

[03:44:09.209 --> 03:44:10.250]  We stay on air.
[03:44:10.350 --> 03:44:11.069]  You help keep us on air.
[03:44:11.190 --> 03:44:12.729]  If a war shuts down, you got a keepsake.
[03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:14.110]  That's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:44:14.610 --> 03:44:15.450]  They're all there.
[03:44:15.610 --> 03:44:16.350]  Save the frogs.

[03:44:24.799 --> 03:44:31.559]  Five, six days left on the 30th will be the announcement on the huge Dodge turbo diesel truck and the $10,000.
[03:44:32.059 --> 03:44:34.639]  That's $146,000 value.
[03:44:35.459 --> 03:44:37.319]  And that's a fun thing to do.

[03:44:42.600 --> 03:44:43.239]  A great sponsor.
[03:44:43.559 --> 03:44:48.219]  Great folks are going to make sure we stay on here one way or the other, but we're having to get capital to do that.
[03:44:58.470 --> 03:45:03.090]  We're good to go.
[03:45:16.520 --> 03:45:17.920]  So, even though his ship was sinking.
[03:45:18.239 --> 03:45:19.940]  So, we're not backing down.
[03:45:20.059 --> 03:45:20.739]  We're not giving up.
[03:45:20.819 --> 03:45:21.899]  And the world's waking up.
[03:45:21.979 --> 03:45:22.579]  And RFK Jr.
[03:45:22.760 --> 03:45:26.520]  and Trump and Tulsi Gabbards and, you know, all these other great people are fighting back.
[03:45:26.719 --> 03:45:27.739]  Folks like Brigham Mueller.
[03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:29.219]  It is so exciting.
[03:45:29.319 --> 03:45:31.299]  So, I want to thank you all for the great jobs you're doing.
[03:45:31.719 --> 03:45:33.299]  Owen Schroer's coming up 3 p.m.
[03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:34.620]  in just a few minutes to the War Room.
[03:45:34.760 --> 03:45:35.340]  Share that link.
[03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:38.139]  I'm doing a special emergency broadcast 3 p.m.
[03:45:38.520 --> 03:45:39.920]  tomorrow out of another studio.
[03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:43.350]  At OnX, AJNLive.
[03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:48.729]  So follow me at AJNLive, at AJNLive, or AlexJones.network.
[03:45:48.829 --> 03:45:51.129]  Sites there, being built up, being expanded.
[03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:53.270]  And that's not the only stuff going on.
[03:45:53.350 --> 03:45:55.590]  That's the emergency backup system.
[03:45:55.809 --> 03:45:58.549]  We'll know a lot more very, very soon, but they've miscalculated.
[03:45:58.770 --> 03:46:01.370]  Because just because they declare victory against us, I'm not going to give up.
[03:46:01.549 --> 03:46:03.090]  In fact, we're reaching more people than ever.
[03:46:03.290 --> 03:46:06.010]  This show right now, conservatively, 10 million people are watching.
[03:46:06.689 --> 03:46:08.770]  On the talk radio stations, five, six million.
[03:46:09.010 --> 03:46:12.670]  By the end of the weekend, the rebroadcast, all of it, we'll be at 35, 40 million.
[03:46:13.309 --> 03:46:13.590]  Guaranteed.
[03:46:13.709 --> 03:46:13.909]  Watch.
[03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.370]  It'll happen.
[03:46:14.430 --> 03:46:15.229]  I'll show it to you on Monday.
[03:46:15.649 --> 03:46:17.229]  So, thanks to all of you spreading the word.
[03:46:17.270 --> 03:46:17.989]  We're kicking ass.
[03:46:18.190 --> 03:46:24.590]  Be sure to check out Brigham's amazing company, ways2well.com, and be sure to follow him on X. He just got back up on there.
[03:46:25.809 --> 03:46:26.090]  FerrisBueller81.
[03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:27.290]  And, Mr.
[03:46:27.409 --> 03:46:28.649]  Bueller, thank you so much.
[03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:29.489]  Thank you for having me.
[03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.829]  I appreciate it.
[03:46:29.889 --> 03:46:30.489]  Bueller, Bueller.
[03:46:30.610 --> 03:46:31.110]  I love that movie.
[03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.709]  Thanks, man.
[03:46:31.729 --> 03:46:32.209]  You kicked ass.
[03:46:32.250 --> 03:46:33.309]  Let me say bye to you before you leave.
[03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:34.549]  And, wow.
[03:46:34.770 --> 03:46:38.489]  And Owen will obviously, as soon as it drops, be covering the Joe Rogan deal with Trump.
[03:46:38.569 --> 03:46:39.370]  We'll be covering it all.
[03:46:39.489 --> 03:46:40.969]  Watch Infowars.com.
[03:46:41.190 --> 03:46:43.649]  Band out video and follow me at RealAlexJonesOnX.
[03:46:43.889 --> 03:46:45.010]  Great job with the crew.
[03:46:45.430 --> 03:46:48.129]  Now, Owen Schroyer of The War Room comes up now.
[03:46:48.489 --> 03:46:49.229]  Everybody, retweet.
[03:46:49.329 --> 03:46:49.829]  He's coming on.
[03:46:50.090 --> 03:46:51.329]  Get him 10 million viewers.
[03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:52.829]  You see it everywhere.
[03:46:53.110 --> 03:46:54.110]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:54.270 --> 03:46:55.329]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[03:46:56.350 --> 03:47:04.229]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[03:47:04.909 --> 03:47:11.069]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games and I've been accurate about 98% of the time.
[03:47:11.190 --> 03:47:12.829]  I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[03:47:12.969 --> 03:47:14.010]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.670]  I've made mistakes.
[03:47:15.549 --> 03:47:22.790]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[03:47:23.010 --> 03:47:27.049]  And we're reaching tens of millions of new people every day.
[03:47:27.250 --> 03:47:28.709]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:47:29.350 --> 03:47:31.549]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[03:47:31.690 --> 03:47:33.010]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[03:47:33.430 --> 03:47:36.790]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:44.989]  Infowars' upper sale could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[03:47:45.579 --> 03:47:47.700]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:57.440]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed, there's been backup systems set up and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[03:47:57.500 --> 03:48:01.840]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[03:48:01.899 --> 03:48:06.040]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[03:48:06.299 --> 03:48:08.600]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[03:48:08.739 --> 03:48:10.399]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[03:48:11.239 --> 03:48:16.879]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.

[03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:59.209]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[03:48:59.629 --> 03:49:02.389]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[03:49:02.709 --> 03:49:12.889]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like organic B-complex.
[03:49:16.329 --> 03:49:20.350]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[03:49:20.530 --> 03:49:21.510]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:49:21.770 --> 03:49:26.649]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[03:49:27.069 --> 03:49:28.329]  But everybody feels it.
[03:49:28.450 --> 03:49:33.170]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want.
[03:49:33.250 --> 03:49:33.690]  A lot of people do.
[03:49:33.909 --> 03:49:37.950]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[03:49:38.760 --> 03:49:42.579]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[03:49:42.879 --> 03:49:45.559]  You want to experience Next Level Foundational Energy.

[03:50:46.110 --> 03:50:52.790]  Just some of the sprouts, your gut uses them, it's a long story, to create a special type of...
[03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:58.590]  I mean, no acid that only your intestines can create that helps regrow, you know, tendons, muscle.

[03:51:07.489 --> 03:51:14.809]  So if you want to back what we're doing, you want to keep us on the air and your great products at the same time, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:17.469]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, we can't do this without you.
[03:51:18.090 --> 03:51:22.979]  Um, If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[03:51:23.020 --> 03:51:23.760]  But that's not happening.
[03:51:23.959 --> 03:51:29.000]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[03:51:29.340 --> 03:51:31.719]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[03:51:31.719 --> 03:51:33.899]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.
[03:51:34.020 --> 03:51:35.959]  I want you to see how great these products are.
[03:51:35.979 --> 03:51:36.739]  My dad does.
[03:51:36.879 --> 03:51:38.479]  I need to sponsor into the future.
[03:51:38.600 --> 03:51:41.780]  So I want you to get high-quality products that really work so you come back.
[03:51:42.569 --> 03:51:46.129]  Again and again, like a restaurant that serves really good, healthy, high-quality, delicious food.
[03:51:46.290 --> 03:51:47.409]  I want the line around the block.
[03:51:47.530 --> 03:51:48.569]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:51.030]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:53.709]  So you got to try it to see how great it is.
[03:51:54.270 --> 03:51:55.090]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[03:51:55.270 --> 03:51:58.610]  And separately, our other big sponsor is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:51:58.989 --> 03:52:04.190]  They will continue to make sure we stay on the air with t-shirts, with other high-quality supplements, with ball caps, with hoodies.
[03:52:04.489 --> 03:52:05.649]  There's some amazing designs.
[03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:08.209]  Some of the shirts are $20, $25, $30.
[03:52:08.610 --> 03:52:12.129]  But there are two shirts, the classic InfoWars red on navy blue.
[03:52:13.540 --> 03:52:24.120]  And a rebellion to tyrants shirt that are both $50 that have extra markup in them if you really want to support us being sure we have the funds we need to go in the future.
[03:52:24.379 --> 03:52:27.059]  And on my children, we are behind on funds.
[03:52:28.399 --> 03:52:32.760]  I haven't been defeated yet because you've been backing me, but we are so close right now.
[03:52:33.020 --> 03:52:42.280]  And so I'm here asking for your support and asking you humbly to take action now and get great products at thealexjonesstore.com as well as drjonesnagrills.com.

[03:53:34.450 --> 03:53:35.489]  And I see you doing it.

[03:53:56.500 --> 03:54:01.500]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[03:54:01.680 --> 03:54:09.879]  And I, cause I hadn't really, you know, cause other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great Patriot backers, total Patriots, Jay Sixers, you name it.
[03:54:10.969 --> 03:54:13.129]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[03:54:13.350 --> 03:54:17.090]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[03:54:17.709 --> 03:54:27.889]  So, if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[03:55:56.639 --> 03:55:57.860]  It just goes on from there.
[03:55:58.920 --> 03:56:04.979]  TheAllocShowStore.com forward slash VIP. Or at the top of TheAllocShowStore.com, you see the VIP button.
[03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:07.319]  We're fighting the new world order.
[03:56:07.440 --> 03:56:09.200]  I don't have millionaire backers.
[03:56:09.420 --> 03:56:13.920]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:15.319]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:56:16.059 --> 03:56:17.079]  TheAllocShowStore.com.
[03:56:17.799 --> 03:56:23.360]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:56:23.579 --> 03:56:28.600]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real and I can't be bought and I can't be intimidated.
[03:56:28.719 --> 03:56:32.659]  And I'm wild and I scare them.
[03:56:32.920 --> 03:56:35.700]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person.
[03:56:36.579 --> 03:56:39.920]  But Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:56:40.059 --> 03:56:42.059]  And that's good because I don't like them either.
[03:56:42.579 --> 03:56:45.020]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:56:45.459 --> 03:56:46.200]  We've already...
[03:56:47.149 --> 03:56:48.229]  Just devastated them.
[03:56:48.350 --> 03:56:51.389]  I mean, world government, the New World orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:56:51.629 --> 03:56:52.950]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:56:53.450 --> 03:56:54.530]  They're super dangerous.
[03:56:54.670 --> 03:56:57.250]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[03:56:57.649 --> 03:57:04.790]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these...
[03:57:05.409 --> 03:57:07.909]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:57:08.209 --> 03:57:09.690]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:57:09.850 --> 03:57:12.569]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:57:12.909 --> 03:57:16.229]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:57:16.510 --> 03:57:18.670]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[03:57:18.770 --> 03:57:20.170]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[03:57:20.370 --> 03:57:28.850]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over us with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[03:57:29.069 --> 03:57:37.239]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[03:57:38.540 --> 03:57:39.700]  I mean, it's just...
[03:57:39.700 --> 03:57:41.059]  This is a joke.
[03:57:41.360 --> 03:57:42.520]  This is ridiculous.
[03:57:42.979 --> 03:57:44.100]  We're changing the world.
[03:57:44.219 --> 03:57:47.059]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
