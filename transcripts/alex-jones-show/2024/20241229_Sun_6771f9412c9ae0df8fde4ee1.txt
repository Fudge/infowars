[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]  It's Sunday, December 29th, 2024, and Jimmy Carter has died at the age of 100 years of age at his home in Georgia.
[00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:20.579]  Now, I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but Jimmy Carter helped set up the Trilateral Commission, establish Really official world government that our country started waiving our sovereignty to.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.199]  He handed over the Panama Canal that's now been handed over to the Communist Chinese.
[00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.660]  He helped start dissolving our borders.
[00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.899]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.020]  He began selling out our industry overseas, but it wasn't really Jimmy Carter himself that was evil from my research view.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.259]  It was the people around him, like Sebastian Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, and others.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.420]  And compared to the people that came later, like George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he was a good guy.
[00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.859]  But that's comparing Jimmy Carter to them.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:01.579]  The big takeaway here is that his death is emblematic of really the death of the Democratic Party that I don't see surviving much longer in the future in such a criminal organization.
[00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.510]  We still need at least a two-party system in America.
[00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.069]  There should be a larger debate about what that system is going to look like.
[00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.549]  It's got to get the libertarian wing of the Democratic Party that used to have some power within them but doesn't really exist anymore.
[00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.069]  They're now just corporate fascists that support every war, every big pharma tyranny, you name it.
[00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.530]  There's been a libertarian arm in the Republican Party, but it's kind of just withered away because it became so corporatist.
[00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.969]  But now in the Republican Party, you have the populist America-firsters versus kind of the classic Republican Party-type system.
[00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.549]  So it's a complex situation, but there's definitely a huge political realignment happening right now.
[00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:53.090]  What matters is that we are, in general, anti-globalist, pro-national sovereignty, anti-communist, And want to see the globalists defeated.
[00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.250]  So thank you so much for watching on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.430]  Jason Geiser takes over now.
[00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.370]  More special reports coming up.
[00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.590]  But happy trails to Jimmy Carter.
[00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.530]  We hope that he made it through the pearly gates.
[00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.629]  I'm not going to judge him.
[00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.170]  His record will do that for him.
[00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.330]  And I'm asking you for your good and for your nation's security.
[00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.689]  To take no unnecessary trips.
[00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.069]  To use carpools or public transportation whenever you can.
[00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.490]  To park your car one extra day per week.
[00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.569]  To obey the speed limit.
[00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.469]  And to set your thermostats to save fuel.
[00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:35.530]  Every act of energy conservation like this is more than just common sense.
[00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.449]  I tell you it is an act of patriotism.
[00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.069]  Our nation must be fair to the poorest among us.
[00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.069]  So we will increase aid to needy Americans to cope with rising energy prices.
[00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.389]  We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice.
[00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.729]  In fact, it is a most painless and immediate way of rebuilding our nation's strength.
[00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.110]  Every gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.360]  It gives us more freedom, more confidence, that much more control over our own lives.
[00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:24.539]  So the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our country.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:34.520]  It can rekindle our sense of unity, our confidence in the future, and give our nation and all of us individually a new sense of purpose.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.180]  You know we can do it.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.180]  We have the natural resources.
[00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.000]  We have more oil in our shell alone than several Saudi Arabians.
[00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.340]  We have more coal than any nation on earth.
[00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.020]  We have the world's highest level of technology.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.860]  We have the most skilled workforce with innovative genius.
[00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:07.300]  And I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war.
[00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:16.329]  I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy.
[00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:27.430]  I do not promise a quick way out of our nation's problems when the truth is that the only way out is an all-out effort.
[00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:39.670]  What I do promise you is that I will lead our fight, and I will enforce fairness in our struggle, and I will ensure honesty.
[00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.579]  And above all, I will act.
[00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:57.480]  Alex will be back in studio on Thursday.
[00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:59.709]  Maybe even sooner.
[00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:13.290]  He's teased the idea of coming back into town as soon as tomorrow, but I'll be your host in his absence for the next three hours and 53 minutes and 30 seconds in the final hour of the broadcast tonight between 7 and 8 o'clock Central Time.
[00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.569]  I will be taking your calls, but it is all clips and news and breaking analysis until then.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.860]  Some of the things we're going to talk about are Biden leaving office and disgrace.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:43.560]  We might touch a little bit on Jimmy Carter's death and his legacy and what that means for the Democratic Party, what's next for the Democratic Party, as well as all of these developments surrounding bird flu and CNN and mainstream media and the CDC and others just trying to make it a thing because they missed the pandemic from 2020. It was such an opportunity for them to expand their powers indefinitely.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:54.420]  Plus, we are going to touch a little bit on the H-1B visas, but we're not going to monopolize too much time with that just because it's something that's been covered incessantly over the course of the last several days.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.600]  However, we will touch on it some because there are some developments on that front.
[00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.680]  Now, I want to get right into Biden leaving office in disgrace.
[00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.980]  This is clip number four we're going to play in a minute here.
[00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:10.279]  Joe Biden will leave the office of the presidency in disgrace, said CNN contributor Scott Jennings on Sunday.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.540]  Let's watch a little bit of this clip and then unpack it on the other side.
[00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.610]  I'm sorry, which hostages?
[00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.209]  He's gotten a number of people home.
[00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.790]  There's still 100 people over there.
[00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:20.750]  Well, there were more than that.
[00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.889]  Including some Americans.
[00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.550]  Look, I think he's going to leave office in disgrace.
[00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.810]  The Hunter Biden pardon was disgraceful.
[00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.990]  He's going to be remembered largely for inflation and for the disastrous Afghanistan pullout.
[00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:44.569]  And I think as we continue to, we're just getting the first draft of this now, but as we continue to learn about the massive cover-up that went on, Not about his health, but about his mental acuity.
[00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:56.329]  To cover that up, the efforts that were undertaken by the White House staff, by his family, not in the last couple of months, but for all four years, I think it's going to be a really ugly chapter.
[00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.350]  It's a diminished presidency because of it.
[00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.110]  And I think we still don't know the full extent of what they did to try to hide what they've been doing over in the West.
[00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.089]  So I think leaving in disgrace is when you have an insurrection at the Capitol.
[00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.310]  Like, that's leaving in disgrace.
[00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.550]  Being impeached twice is leaving in disgrace.
[00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.370]  So that's a difference.
[00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:22.639]  I think Joe Biden's going to be remembered in the short term for what you were talking about, whether or not he had the capacity to lead, who knew what when.
[00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:28.800]  I mean, there are many people outside of the very small network of Anita Dunn and Valerie Biden Owens and Jill Biden and Hunter.
[00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:35.139]  There aren't many people who knew the concerns that were there or whether or not he was up or fit for the job.
[00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.620]  And so those questions will be asked.
[00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:39.279]  Over the long term, this is somebody a lot like Mitch McConnell.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.560]  You don't necessarily have to agree with everything they stood for.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.500]  You don't have to agree with every vote.
[00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.079]  But you always knew they put the American people first.
[00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.500]  You always knew that.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.480]  We had different paths of getting there, but that's what they believed in.
[00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:57.879]  They believed in this country, they believed in these institutions, and they did their best to strengthen them from different perspectives and different purchase.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.899]  Tangibly, Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS Act, putting Kentonji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:15.279]  I mean, these are things, you have prescription prices that are capped, things that Donald Trump's going to take credit for emerging from COVID. Tangibly, from a political perspective, bipartisanship, that's what Joe Biden means.
[00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:21.370]  I think in the short term he will be remembered in part by the sense of buyer's remorse that a lot of voters, I think, felt.
[00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:33.470]  That there was hope when he had come into office in the wake of January 6th and what have you to say, I want to be a president who's going to be unifying and I'm going to be a president who's going to set up the next generation of democratic leadership.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:41.519]  And I think a lot of voters feel like they did not come away from these four years with a world that feels more stable, an economy that feels better.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.460]  And so in the short term, it's that buyer's remorse that they didn't get the Biden presidency they were perhaps hoping for.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:56.019]  And that's why we have Donald Trump coming back, which leads into this longer term legacy of he could have been someone that could have said, I am representing this past era of leadership.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.639]  I'm going to do it my way, and then I'm going to hand over the reins.
[00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:12.669]  The fact that he gave that speech saying it's time to hand over the reins in January of 2024 and not pretty early on in his presidency, especially with what we know now about how long he's been experiencing these challenges, I think that's the long-term challenge of the legacy he'll face.
[00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:12.990]  All right.
[00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:22.129]  Before we go, quick whip around, very quick, predictions 2025. I'm feeling somewhat optimistic about the way things are going in a lot of global hotspots.
[00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:37.509]  So whether it is in the Middle East, where things seem particularly unstable and chaotic, or whether it's this long and drawn-out conflict with Russia and Ukraine, I do think that even though Donald Trump and I are not always on the same page when it comes to foreign policy, I'm optimistic that his new approach can bring about something new.
[00:09:37.809 --> 00:09:39.649]  Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit more fun.
[00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.610]  If you may have noticed, the last couple of weeks, though, members of Congress, when they show up on television...
[00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:44.610]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.649]  So here's the fact of the matter, folks.
[00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:51.570]  The fact of the matter is, Joe Biden's legacy is going to be very similar to Jimmy Carter's.
[00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.129]  The only difference is, where Jimmy Carter failed...
[00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:07.750]  In earnestness, because he was incompetent and incapable of being the President of the United States, Joe Biden not only failed at incompetence because he was literally losing his mind, but he failed because he was so abundantly corrupt.
[00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:16.779]  Everyone is going to remember Joe Biden for stealing the election in 2020. They're gonna remember him for pardoning his son going back ten and a half years.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.460]  They're gonna remember him for all the corruption when he was the Vice President of the United States with his son.
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.659]  I mean, we've seen reports this week alone of all of the photographs with Chinese nationals that have been coming out from the State Department themselves.
[00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:39.039]  So this legacy from Joe Biden is going to be very similar to Jimmy Carter's, only Joe Biden has another degree, another level of corruption layered on top.
[00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:43.980]  This is not going to be short-term, oh yeah, short-term, things were really tough for buyer's remorse.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:55.840]  This is going to be a long-term negative legacy because the fact of the matter is, I can't think of a single thing that he accomplished or did well other than the commuting of the sentence of Julian Assange.
[00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:56.940]  That was the...
[00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.049]  Single, solitude-only decision that he made that I think I can agree with.
[00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:18.210]  And the fact that he's leaving Snowden hanging, the fact that he's pardoning all of these people who have been responsible for the murder of children while over 320,000 children are missing in the United States because of human trafficking across our open border.
[00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:22.149]  A border which was, under Joe Biden, invaded by at least 25 million people.
[00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.269]  Including 500,000 to a million at least known criminals.
[00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:31.769]  I mean, this week we saw the viral post.
[00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:48.549]  The viral video of the woman being set on fire as she slept in a New York City subway, only to find out that the culprit, the perpetrator of that crime, that heinous and abusive crime, was himself someone who had been deported and came back into the United States from Guatemala.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.139]  The legacy is going to be the hundreds of thousands of missing children.
[00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.000]  The millions upon millions of people who invaded our country.
[00:11:56.179 --> 00:11:59.860]  The war in Ukraine and how we funded it incessantly for no reason whatsoever.
[00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:05.120]  The escalation of the conflict between Israel and Gaza and the West Bank.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.820]  Tensions increasing with China and Taiwan.
[00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:17.700]  I mean, his legacy is going to be the fact that he was the President of the United States who almost started World War III. And there's still a few weeks left.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.509]  He still could start World War III. Absolutely zero transparency from this administration.
[00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:24.750]  Total corruption.
[00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:26.169]  Obviously lost his mind.
[00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:40.090]  How many whistleblowers have to come out before the general populace understands that we had somebody who was running the country, or who was supposed to be running the country, and instead was playing with Lincoln logs and action figures in the Oval Office carpet because he was incapable of putting a sentence together.
[00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:51.779]  This is the legacy of Joe Biden who bragged incessantly about how inflation has reached its lowest rate ever right after during his administration it had its highest rates ever.
[00:12:52.899 --> 00:13:01.340]  Who bragged about massive increases in the number of jobs and we know that the number of jobs that became available were because it was bouncing back from the pandemic.
[00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.570]  All those jobs were erased and then by default they came back and he claimed that he created all of those jobs.
[00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.610]  You want to talk to me about the Inflation Reduction Act?
[00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:14.529]  How many of you out there in the audience have gone to the grocery store and left with less than is on your list?
[00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:24.730]  How many of you in the audience have gone from 2019 when the economy was booming, filling up your gas tank full to now putting a quarter tank or a half a tank in at a time?
[00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.470]  I think a lot of you.
[00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:28.840]  And it's not just my gut that says that.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:42.700]  I think the voters said that on November 5th when they came out in droves to vote for Donald Trump in a landslide victory against Kamala Harris, who, by the way, initiated a coup with the backing of Pelosi and the Democratic establishment against Joe Biden, as corrupt as he is.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.820]  I don't think he should have been the victim of a coup.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.179]  What do you mean there's going to be a legacy of the Inflation Reduction Act?
[00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:55.980]  Wait, he did such a good job doing photo shoots on a bridge?
[00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.210]  What do you mean?
[00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:04.210]  What positive legacy could there possibly be other than the commuting of Julian Assange's sentence?
[00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:06.190]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.370]  Here's Raskin, clip number 36, talking a little bit about the Biden pardons and what he should do.
[00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.509]  We know Raskin himself is basically a communist.
[00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:21.289]  We know that he's a major leftist in the sense that he is all for persecuting and prosecuting political dissidents and political opponents.
[00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:23.809]  But here he is commenting on Joe Biden's pardoning.
[00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:26.330]  Let's watch clip 36. Back to Liz Cheney.
[00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.470]  Do you think it would be wise for her to accept and for President Biden to confer a preemptive pardon to protect her?
[00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:38.649]  Or others who have been implicated by the language of those in the Trump inner circle?
[00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.690]  I mean, I don't want to get into particular cases.
[00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.470]  I think that's entirely within the executive branch prerogative to deal with those things.
[00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.309]  And it is as complicated as any other legal case.
[00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.750]  There are pros and cons, and it's especially complicated today.
[00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:01.610]  Because we're talking about pardoning people who have not done anything wrong, much less committed a crime.
[00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:11.549]  And we're talking about the pardon of people, not because of anything they've done, but because of a president making outrageous threats against them.
[00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.429]  That's historically unprecedented, right?
[00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:23.080]  So anybody who's contemplating one of those pardons has to weigh whatever added measure of legal security.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.500]  Raskin of all people wants to talk about outrageous threats.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.500]  I'm going to show you clip 40 here in a second.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:33.919]  This is Adam Schiff over the years on threatening political opponents and whether he's for it or against it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:45.740]  But you have to understand that Raskin is perhaps single-handedly the most responsible for the persecution, prosecution of political opponents of any other member of Congress.
[00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.129]  With the exception of maybe Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.
[00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.750]  I mean, this is someone who has advocated time and time again for the persecution and prosecution of political opponents.
[00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:01.389]  We have people from January 6th who are still in jail three years later.
[00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.309]  Gosh, almost four years later with no charges.
[00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:07.629]  Some of them have been sentenced to decades in prison.
[00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:24.220]  They weren't even in the Capitol on the day of January 6th, 2021. Not to mention the attacks on Steve Bannon or Owen Schroer or Roger Stone or Alex Jones or Donald Trump himself or members of his staff or his administration.
[00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:34.179]  They made a list of the most notable Trump supporters and they single-handedly went after all of them unless they worked for a mainstream media outlet.
[00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:38.929]  You ask, well, why is Fox News protected?
[00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.730]  Well, it's protected because it is controlled opposition ever since Project Mockingbird.
[00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:47.289]  And if you don't play ball at Fox News, you get fired, just like Tucker Carlson was fired.
[00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:53.169]  Alex Jones famously predicted that at least a month before it happened, and somebody with integrity just simply cannot work there anymore.
[00:16:53.169 --> 00:16:56.389]  They're going to find a way to get you out because of political persecution.
[00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.190]  This is clip number 40 of Adam Schiff over the years.
[00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:04.490]  On the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him.
[00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.650]  Very strongly in favor of indicting the president when he is out of office.
[00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:13.470]  I don't think the incoming president should be threatening his political opponents with jail time.
[00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.109]  So now it's so inappropriate.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.690]  Now it's not okay to threaten political opponents.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:31.779]  When that's all the opponents of Trump and his administration did during his entire administration, during the re-election campaign, and most recently during this election campaign.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:40.500]  And they didn't stop at just threatening political candidates or members of administration.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.140]  They threatened the entire populace of populists.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.039]  Need I remind you, speaking of Joe Biden's legacy...
[00:17:51.069 --> 00:18:06.089]  Of countless speeches that he gave, some of them looking exactly like a leader of the Sith or the Empire with their red lights in the background where he said that the greatest threat to national security is domestic terrorism,
[00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.369]  white supremacy, MAGA extremism, Republicans.
[00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:14.230]  Namely, MAGA Republicans.
[00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:26.029]  Notice how the Democrats over the course of the last four years have been very careful and intentional about distinguishing between Republicans and MAGA Republicans, between neoconservatives and MAGA extremists.
[00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.490]  They're trying to split the party.
[00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.670]  We've seen it all over the news the last seven days where they're trying to split the party.
[00:18:31.769 --> 00:18:33.809]  First they call Elon Musk, President Elon.
[00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:40.210]  We're good to go.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.759]  It's clear how Elon Musk has always perceived them.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.440]  There's no new news here.
[00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.720]  There's no new development here.
[00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:08.039]  But they're trying to manufacture and orchestrate the schism because they want to divide MAGA Republicans against themselves so the neocons can sweep the party again.
[00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:08.660]  That's what's happening.
[00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:11.509]  Because the neoconservatives are the same as the Democrats.
[00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.269]  They're all part of the uniparty.
[00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.890]  They're trying to re-establish a uniparty.
[00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:24.589]  And the only way they can do that is to pit MAGA against itself over issues like Elon Musk or Vivek or Maswami or RFK Jr. or any of Trump's policies.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.160]  And we have democratic strategists that are marveling at the fact that we had so much support from Hispanics.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.019]  This is clip number 37 here.
[00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:41.160]  I mean, there was a major populist movement and awakening that happened in this country on November 5th.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.460]  And they are so terrified of it that they'll do anything.
[00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:44.279]  They'll make up anything.
[00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:45.059]  They'll push anything.
[00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:57.079]  To ensure that this schism persists, that there is a civil war within the right in the United States of America because they realize that they don't have the power they once had.
[00:19:57.559 --> 00:20:11.819]  That they no longer have a monopoly over information in this country, and so they're trying to wield more strategically the remaining power that they do have in order to divide Republicans against each other, MAGA Republicans against each other, populists against each other, so that they can seize all the power.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:29.170]  It's exactly what Hitler did in 1933. There were so many different parties in Germany in the late 1920s and the early 1930s that despite the fact that only 1 in 40 Germans were actually Nazis, they were able to seize all of the power by pitting all the existing parties against one another,
[00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.509]  and they were the only ones left.
[00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.529]  That's what we're seeing from the leftists right now.
[00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.930]  It's straight from Hitler's playbook.
[00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:37.289]  It's bull, and we shouldn't fall for it.
[00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:44.849]  Let's watch clip number 37. So what Hispanic voters did in many ways across this country is vote with their wallets.
[00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:51.869]  But it is also clear when you think about what happened in a place like South Texas.
[00:20:52.759 --> 00:21:07.259]  On the border, that sure, the economy is a part of it, but also their clear hostility about immigration, which to many of us in blue states and sitting in a place like New York seems like, well, how can that be possible?
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.980]  But I would sit, and I said this to Basil before, I would sit in a focus group with Hispanic voters.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:20.559]  They would talk about immigration, and you would swear to God you were sitting in a room with a bunch of cranky white guys from Missouri.
[00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.769]  Not Hispanic voters when you were talking about immigration.
[00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:41.009]  And so the flaw there is that the immigration, that the sort of mass increase in immigration, which happened in the first couple years of the Biden administration, that will have been one of the great reasons, potentially, that we lost.
[00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:50.369]  Yeah, so they're trying to explain away what happened, and they're just so shocked that Hispanics would vote alongside white Americans.
[00:21:52.049 --> 00:22:01.829]  And remember, the left is the party that hates racism so much, but then they do everything they can to ascribe all of the injustices of the world to white people.
[00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.309]  And I'm not somebody who gets up here and tries to pit race against race or defend my own race.
[00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.329]  I don't believe in the notion of race at all, which is why I don't try to defend white people.
[00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.329]  I try to defend Western culture.
[00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:21.490]  Now the left and the commies will all tell you that Western culture is inherently a product of white supremacy or white privilege.
[00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:27.349]  They try to link and marry the notions of Western culture with race as much as possible.
[00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.569]  That way they can simply attack the race and bring down the culture.
[00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.210]  But I disagree.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:42.339]  The fact of the matter is, Western culture, though yes, maybe cultivated mostly by white people, has nothing to do with race whatsoever and only everything to do with values.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.059]  Or was it Martin Luther King?
[00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:47.460]  Famously said...
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.380]  Not to judge people by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:58.519]  You can be any race and ascribe to the values and principles and philosophies behind Western culture.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.839]  You can be any race and still believe in the claims made in John Locke's second treaties of government.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:13.839]  You can be any race and still understand that Milton Friedman was right about capitalism or that Adam Smith was right about the invisible hand when he wrote Wealth of Nations.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:21.799]  You can be any race and still understand that Thomas Baines' common sense was, in fact, common sense.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:32.450]  But all the left can do is think about groups because their philosophy is totally void of the principle or notion Of the individual.
[00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.289]  They don't believe in individualism at all.
[00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:39.349]  They only believe in the collective because they're all inspired by Marxist thought, by communist thought.
[00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:53.029]  And so they only think about black people versus white people, or men versus women, or straight people versus the LGBTQ community, or migrants versus natives.
[00:23:54.390 --> 00:24:00.049]  They don't think about Chase or Alex Jones or Owen Schroyer or Harrison Smith or any individual.
[00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:02.250]  An individual is something that doesn't even exist to them.
[00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.549]  They themselves don't even see themselves as individuals.
[00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:09.670]  They see themselves as part of whatever group they identify as.
[00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:17.250]  And they say that you can choose your identity when it comes to your gender or your sexuality.
[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:26.619]  But they don't even believe In the philosophy of free will at all.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.759]  They only believe in these principles when it's conducive to their success.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.000]  They only believe in democracy when it's conducive to their success.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.640]  But then when a country like Ukraine cancels all elections, they post articles about why that's a good thing.
[00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:44.960]  They only believe that the new world order or the deep state doesn't exist when that's conducive to their success.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.259]  But then it does exist and it's a good thing when that's conducive to their success.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.900]  This is the cognitive dissonance of the left that is infecting the entirety of humanity.
[00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:58.940]  But we are winning because there is a great awakening happening right before our eyes.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:09.000]  They want to talk about COVID-19 or they want to talk about the bird flu or the next pandemic which is going to start on January 21st as soon as Donald Trump is president of the United States.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.000]  The real pandemic is the woke mind virus.
[00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:25.900]  This notion that we should sacrifice our individual identities And subscribe only to groupthink, group politics, because as soon as the individual is gone, we have a malleable mass of people.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.619]  Folks, we're coming up on a break in about two minutes here.
[00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:33.220]  I'm going to get into more clips, analysis, details on the other side of this break.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.140]  Before we go to break, I need to remind you to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.859]  Now, we've got a couple of amazing products that are available right now.

[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.799]  And third, it is the Ultimate Turmeric.

[00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:23.609]  But I'm not asking you to check out Ultimate Turmeric at the alexjonesstore.com just because it's awesome for inflammation.

[00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:40.460]  But you're also supporting InfoWars and Alex Jones in ensuring that this network can stay on the air.
[00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:50.700]  Now, I know that we've had some incredible victories over the course of the last several weeks in these lawsuits against the New World Order, with the judge overturning The Onion being able to buy InfoWars.
[00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:54.329]  But I'm telling you folks, the fight has just begun.
[00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:03.529]  And we've got more developments, which I'm not at liberty to discuss with you, about how the left and the New World Order and the deep state and the globalists are fighting back and they're still trying to sabotage this operation.
[00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:19.920]  And we need the funds in order to ensure that they are not victorious in 2025.

[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.759]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host this evening.
[00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:35.220]  We will be taking calls in the final hour of the broadcast.
[00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:38.849]  From 7 to 8 p.m.
[00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:39.950]  Central Time.
[00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:41.650]  So keep your phones close by.
[00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.569]  I'm going to tie up this report here.
[00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.789]  Biden regrets leaving presidential race.
[00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:47.410]  Thinks he could have beaten Trump.
[00:27:47.630 --> 00:28:00.349]  Now, we already knew that he felt this way because we had lip reader analysts analyze the conversation at a memorial service that Joe Biden was having with Barack Obama.
[00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.430]  Do you remember that a couple of months ago?
[00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.230]  Where he said things like, I'm stronger than she is.
[00:28:05.329 --> 00:28:06.609]  I'm better than she is.
[00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:08.309]  Obama nodding his head, covering his lips.
[00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.130]  I know, I know.
[00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:10.609]  We did all the analysis.
[00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.009]  Infowars.com published articles about it.
[00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:14.970]  Countless threads about it on social media.
[00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:16.549]  Many of them were spoofs and jokes.
[00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:17.809]  But there were real ones.
[00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.130]  There was real analysis done.
[00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.529]  We know that Joe Biden felt this way the whole time.
[00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:22.869]  And frankly, he's probably right.
[00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:30.630]  Despite the fact that he was dumb to begin with and has now lost his mind and got murdered in that debate politically on June 27th.
[00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:33.339]  He still had momentum than Kamala Harris.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.240]  There was a coup.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.240]  She was never popular.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:42.180]  She was the least popular candidate in 2020. It was totally stupid that she swooped in and Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic establishment backed her.
[00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.519]  And that's why they lost.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:49.240]  Because Democrats seem to finally be totally sick of the fact that they haven't had primaries in many, many years.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.859]  2016, Hillary Clinton stole it from Bernie.
[00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:52.680]  She lost.
[00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:55.819]  2020, Joe Biden won the primary, but he stole the election.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:19.140]  2024 Kamala Harris stole the primary she lost when they steal they lose when they lie they lose and they can't do anything except for lie if they can even get a sentence out but here's clip number 43 of jasmine crockett who seems to be coming down with the same illness that joe biden has and that she has a hard time putting a sentence together let's watch this I don't know.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:25.859]  I mean, it is crazy that this guy is about to walk into the White House for a second time.
[00:29:26.839 --> 00:29:30.819]  And again, I kept saying on the campaign trail, this guy doesn't know who our friends are.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:39.660]  Now, I can tell you that he loves to pal around with Putin, and we know that Putin has decided that he wants to bring back the former coalition that they used to have.
[00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.009]  And that's why he went into Ukraine.
[00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:47.569]  I am here to say that we've got to have really good people around Trump.
[00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:59.130]  And right now, the people he's picking are not the best people because somebody needs to explain to him in a very elementary way why we don't go after our friends, why we don't start wars.
[00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.750]  And honestly, that includes even tariff wars with our friends.
[00:30:03.829 --> 00:30:05.309]  Why we don't go after our friends.
[00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:06.769]  Why we don't start wars.
[00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:13.329]  I mean, this is the democratic machine that has gone after American citizens and journalists incessantly.
[00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.849]  From all the J6ers to others.
[00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:22.069]  What greater allies do we have or greater friends do we have than our fellow Americans?
[00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.329]  Why we don't start wars.
[00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.829]  She's criticizing Donald Trump who started no new wars.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.740]  After countless wars and violent conflicts have broken out under this Biden administration.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.380]  Most famously, of course, the war between Ukraine and Russia.
[00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:46.460]  A totally unnecessary war provoked by the United States and NATO that has resulted in at least, at least, a half a million dead.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.859]  Not to mention all of those displaced.
[00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:51.940]  Not to mention all of the money that has gone into this conflict.
[00:30:52.119 --> 00:31:02.789]  And I know Dan Crenshaw and others like to say that this is a great way for us to kill Russians without sacrificing a single American life.
[00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:19.609]  But if you take the average amount that an American pays in income tax over the course of their lifetime and see how many times that number goes into the massive number of funding that we have given Ukraine over the course of the last three years,
[00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:25.549]  you'll find that we've actually sacrificed thousands upon thousands of American lives in this conflict.
[00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:28.759]  Because of the amount of tax money that has gone to it.
[00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:34.720]  I mean, if we're really going to be real about it, time is the stuff that life is made of.
[00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:37.880]  This is a famous quote, I believe, from Benjamin Franklin.
[00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:38.920]  Don't waste time.
[00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:40.359]  After all, it's the stuff life's made of.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:54.049]  And if one out of every four days that we work is dedicated to paying income tax, more than that if you count all the other taxes, And thousands upon thousands of lifetimes worth of taxes have gone to this conflict.
[00:31:54.230 --> 00:32:02.869]  Even if nobody's literally died in this conflict, it is thousands upon thousands of American lives, their time, that has been dedicated to funding this.
[00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.670]  And they say that we're going to get paid back.
[00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.569]  Maybe we will.
[00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:07.509]  Maybe we won't.
[00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.269]  I doubt it.
[00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.109]  I don't see how Ukraine is going to win this conflict.
[00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:14.430]  And if Russia wins, are they going to pay us back for the money that we've loaned Ukraine?
[00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.769]  Under this proxy state that they set up?
[00:32:17.089 --> 00:32:19.430]  Under this satellite state that they set up?
[00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:22.049]  Under this Russian cutout that they set up?
[00:32:23.529 --> 00:32:30.089]  It's all an unbelievable scam and all of this in the context of scam after scam after scam.
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.890]  Namely the most recent development that the CDC has confirmed.
[00:32:33.089 --> 00:32:36.829]  The first severe case of bird flu with new mutations.
[00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.210]  I'm going to show you clip 46 here in a second.
[00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:45.950]  But remember, one person allegedly got the bird flu in Louisiana.
[00:32:47.179 --> 00:33:00.680]  This, after months and months, if not years under this administration, of experts in mainstream media outlets and pundits and scientists and health advisors and health experts coming out and saying that, hey, this raw milk thing is really dangerous.
[00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:04.019]  Hey, there's a bird flu and eventually it's going to hop to humans.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.299]  Finally, it's hopping to humans.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.059]  Allegedly, one person in Louisiana gets it.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.259]  Gavin Newsom declares a state of emergency in California.
[00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:13.559]  You can hardly find a dozen eggs in California right now.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.859]  I know because I was there over Christmas.
[00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:18.559]  I think they were charging like $12 a dozen if you could find them.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.940]  But the CDC is coming out trying to make it a thing.
[00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.940]  This is clip number 46 of CNN trying to make it a thing.
[00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:26.359]  Let's watch.
[00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:42.500]  One new CDC report on the first severe human case of bird flu in the U.S. Samples taken from a patient in Louisiana show mutations that could make it easier for this virus to spread from person to person.
[00:33:42.819 --> 00:33:50.680]  Right now, there's no evidence it's been passed along to anyone else, and the CDC says risk to the public remains low.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:57.779]  But experts warn a single mutation like this could potentially lead to another pandemic.
[00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:05.349]  The virus may mutate and become more easily transmitted person to person.
[00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:16.869]  So the more this virus circulates and specifically co-circulates with human strains, that's going to increase the odds of the virus evolving to more human to human transmission.
[00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:19.969]  And that, of course, could signal another pandemic.
[00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:24.489]  Joining us now is Dr. Deborah Birx.
[00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:30.969]  You may remember her as the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the first Trump administration.
[00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:37.869]  We are very fortunate to have your expertise as we try to figure out what's going on with the bird flu and what it could mean.
[00:34:38.269 --> 00:34:46.210]  So, so far, 65 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the U.S. this year, all contracted by animals.
[00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.510]  But now we have this new mutation in Louisiana.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.059]  How worried should we be about bird flu potentially becoming another pandemic?
[00:34:55.559 --> 00:35:11.099]  Well I love the way you said 63 cases because I have no idea how many cases there were or are because our number one principle in preventing pandemics is detect And if you go to the CDC website, you can see that they're monitoring more than 10,000 exposures,
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.239]  but they've only tested 530. What does that mean?
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.900]  That means we're not testing enough.
[00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:19.739]  And we know from other viruses that a lot of the spread can be asymptomatic.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.719]  So we're kind of have our head in the sand about how widespread this is from the zoonotic standpoint, from the animal to human standpoint.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.340]  Now, also remember, most of those cases described to date happened in the spring and the summer.
[00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:45.280]  Not when we had H1N1 circulating right now when we're running the flu pandemic throughout the United States.
[00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:46.980]  So we have rising flu cases.
[00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:50.719]  And now we have still suenotic events coming.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:36:02.199]  So now you've set up for potentially a farm worker getting H5N1, also getting the current flu strain, and reassorting in that individual.
[00:36:02.539 --> 00:36:09.079]  To me, that's almost a bigger threat to these mutations happening in individuals over time.
[00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:12.280]  When you say reassorting in that person, what does that mean?
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:24.989]  Okay, so the H5 virus, which Doesn't adapt too well to our upper respiratory tract and is preventing us from getting infected by conspecting cows and pigs and cats and dogs.
[00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:31.829]  So our flu, which has the binding sites for us, for our nasal passages.
[00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.190]  Viruses are very specific and so they're very animal or human specific.
[00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:43.409]  So what they're really saying here is your life is in perpetual danger of these pandemics.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.059]  Under the last Trump administration, a pandemic happened.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.079]  Now you should expect one under the next Trump administration.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:02.039]  The only way to fight against it is to declare states of emergency or encourage people to get vaccinated on a massive scale, especially children.
[00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:11.230]  You have to keep in mind that the number of children who died of COVID-19 is astronomically low, even lower than the number of children who died of the flu.
[00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:18.030]  Children are the most likely and the elderly of dying of the regular flu, but the number was astronomically low for COVID-19.
[00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:30.130]  We're good to go.
[00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:49.730]  Just like with the climate change stuff, they're always trying to make you terrified of what is projected to occur in the future as a distraction to keep you from paying attention to all the terrible things that are happening right now.
[00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:58.670]  So we're not going to talk about the fact that big tech and the government is conspiring to censor you and get a monopoly on all artificial intelligence?
[00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:13.900]  We're not going to talk about the fact that this conflict between Ukraine and Russia has now escalated to the point where long-range missiles created by European nations in the United States are being used to attack sovereign territory within Russia, which could lead to thermonuclear war.
[00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:19.880]  We're not going to talk about the fact that China is constantly doing More drills around Taiwan?
[00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:22.300]  Posturing as if it's going to annex it?
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:34.079]  We're not talking about the fact that the conflict between Israel and Hamas and those in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is escalating to a potential nuclear conflict between Iran and the United States of America?
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.639]  We're not going to talk about any of the things that are happening right now that pose a real risk.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:48.989]  Instead, we're going to focus all of our time talking about how this bird flu may, at some point in time, Hop so that humans get it.
[00:38:49.429 --> 00:38:53.610]  And if humans get it, it may at some point in time become deadly.
[00:38:55.030 --> 00:39:01.010]  I am so sick of the left declaring emergencies for hypotheticals that never seem to come to fruition.
[00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.409]  I mean, look at all of the lies that Al Gore told year after year.
[00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:15.670]  John Kerry told year after year about what was going to happen to the climate, about having no ice in the Arctic by 2014 in the summer.
[00:39:16.579 --> 00:39:18.079]  Saying that it was all just gonna go away.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.320]  Saying that sea levels were gonna rise drastically.
[00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:24.440]  Showing B-roll of natural disaster after natural disaster.
[00:39:24.579 --> 00:39:29.639]  Every natural disaster that has happened has been blamed on climate change with really no evidence to support it whatsoever.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:39.639]  And now we have the likes of Bill Gates and others investing in research to block out the sun and actually engage in human-caused climate change.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.079]  This is the great irony of the left.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.659]  They say that humans are changing the climate.
[00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:50.710]  And that it's going to result in making this planet virtually uninhabitable.
[00:39:51.610 --> 00:40:00.849]  And their solution for their so-called human caused climate change is human caused climate change in the other direction.
[00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:05.130]  You really want to mess with that?
[00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:10.349]  I don't think I would like to mess with the settings or the levers of our climate.
[00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:19.530]  Because even if you have good intentions, you're inadvertently, inevitably, going to cause unintended consequences.
[00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.190]  Killing cats leads to rats.
[00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:34.489]  Just like installing the Shah on Iran eventually led to blowback, eventually led to things like terrorist attacks in the United States, just like bringing the dollar off of the gold standard has eventually led to the unintended consequences of war after war after war in the Middle East.
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:40.469]  Because we have to ensure that oil is traded in dollars.
[00:40:42.809 --> 00:40:52.110]  And just imagine the negative impact on the dollar if the climate change hoaxers get what they advocate.
[00:40:53.070 --> 00:41:02.550]  Imagine if the entire world switches in a matter of just a couple of decades to green energy to the point where oil is no longer needed at all.
[00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.989]  Then what's going to back the dollar?
[00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.230]  Then we'll have total economic collapse.
[00:41:08.409 --> 00:41:17.530]  It seems to me that if the climate change advocates are correct and they get what they want and we fund all of this green energy and everything goes to solar and wind, yes, that's more efficient.
[00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:18.369]  Yes, that's better.
[00:41:18.449 --> 00:41:22.170]  But unless we change our monetary system, we're not going to have anything backing the dollar whatsoever.
[00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.409]  And I advocate for changing the monetary system.
[00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.030]  I believe that it's a lie, that it's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:35.860]  And the longer we perpetuate it, the greater the harm caused the By the inevitable outcome of it.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.599]  By the inevitable collapse of it.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:48.119]  But if we just switched overnight to a world operating exclusively on green energy, eradicating all demand for oil whatsoever, what do you think that means for the U.S. dollar?
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.199]  Why on earth would anyone advocate for that?
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:59.159]  Because, tell you what folks, that's a disaster worse than any projection 100 or 200 or 300 years into the future from these climate change advocates.
[00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:04.210]  But now all of a sudden we've got Bill Gates asking for a Mar-a-Lago meeting.
[00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.170]  The man who's advocated for climate change.
[00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:09.269]  The man who's advocated for vaccines incessantly.
[00:42:09.409 --> 00:42:18.849]  The man who's been responsible for the death of thousands because of the unintended consequences of putting things like poison on mosquito nets only for natives to use to fish.
[00:42:18.989 --> 00:42:20.550]  And then they eat the fish and they get poisoned and they die.
[00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:26.030]  This is clip number 16 here of Bill Gates saying that he wants to speak with Trump in Mar-a-Lago.
[00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:35.239]  Then the second time I saw him was the march after that, so March 2017 in the White House.
[00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:47.219]  In both of those two meetings, he asked me if vaccines weren't a bad thing because he was considering a commission to look into ill effects of vaccines.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:58.610]  And somebody, his name is Robert Kennedy Jr., was advising him that vaccines were causing So there's Bill Gates there, sitting in a Lee Harvey Oswald costume.
[00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:10.969]  But let's recall what Elon Musk said about Bill Gates in this clip from just some time ago, just a short time ago, clip number 17. Will that ever come out, do you think?
[00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:22.570]  You know, I think part of why Kamala's getting so much support is that if Trump wins, that FC and client list is going to become public.
[00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:23.050]  Yes.
[00:43:24.889 --> 00:43:27.809]  And some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome.
[00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:28.550]  Yeah.
[00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.469]  Do you think Reid Hoffman's uncomfortable?
[00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:31.130]  Yes.
[00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:33.750]  And Gates.
[00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:35.760]  Now, we've got clip number 14 here.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.099]  Philanthrocapitalist RFK Jr. questions Bill Gates' motivations.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:55.380]  Quote, I know most about Gates, you know, because I've written a book about him, says Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, recollecting his 2021 book, The Real Anthony Fauci, where RFK Jr. exposes Gates' so-called philanthropic capitalism,
[00:43:55.599 --> 00:44:02.320]  which he explains is using philanthropy to make yourself rich, and you use it strategically, and that's what he's done again and again.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.880]  Here's clip number 14. Watch.
[00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:20.039]  I know most about Gates, you know, because I've written a book about him and that what he calls philanthropy capitalism, which is you use philanthropy to make yourself rich and you use it strategically and that's what he's done again and again.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:35.739]  He's gotten control of the World Health Organization so that they mandate vaccines all over the world, and the companies that make those vaccines are Gates, and many of them, the major shareholder.
[00:44:36.559 --> 00:44:39.960]  And he did the same thing with the Green Revolution.
[00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:51.159]  He got a hold of the regulatory agencies in African countries and forced them to change the nature of agriculture.
[00:44:51.699 --> 00:45:07.179]  There's 20,000 generations of agriculture of people growing crops like sorghum and plantains and Yukon, and all these plans for subsistence.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:17.760]  And he said, no, we're going to transfer them all to these, you know, GMO monocultures of corn, and then we're going to bring in the companies that he owns, Kraft.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.539]  Coca-Cola, McDonald's, these big food companies, processing companies to buy that and that's going to be the deal.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:38.300]  And then of course during COVID, all of that shut down and you had, you know, there's 30 million Africans now as a direct result of Gates's policy who are now on the edge of starvation.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:54.139]  Tell that story that you shared with me a couple of years ago about the vaccines that Gates sent over supposedly for women, for women that, I don't know, was to control birth control or what?
[00:45:55.019 --> 00:46:04.170]  I mean, I think the big The real tell was what happened with the DTP vaccine, which is diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
[00:46:05.469 --> 00:46:14.690]  Because of Gates pushing this shot, it's now the number one vaccine in the world, DTP. And it's mainly given in Africa.
[00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:23.969]  That particular shot is discontinued in the United States because it was killing or badly injuring one out of every 300 kids who took it.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.199]  So we know that Gates has been responsible for catastrophe after catastrophe.
[00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:38.320]  The only question really is whether he's doing it on purpose or just out of narcissistic hubris or arrogance.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.300]  Maybe he doesn't even think that any of this is true.
[00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:56.469]  But it seems to me, based off of all of his behavior over the course of the last several decades, that he's 100% a globalist and he's using his influence and power In order to leverage the world into an anti-human globalist future.
[00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.849]  And he says that it's all about philanthropy.
[00:46:57.989 --> 00:47:00.210]  But we know that these people don't care about anybody but themselves.
[00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:02.829]  We know that governments don't care about anyone but themselves.
[00:47:03.289 --> 00:47:08.230]  We know that it's all about legacy and ambition and conglomeration of power.
[00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:16.199]  And while they push for vaccine after vaccine and the left pushes for pandemic after pandemic, we've got things like this.
[00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:23.320]  Health expert Dr. Nguyen calls for Biden regime to approve 5 million doses of bird flu vaccines before Trump takes office.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.480]  Keep in mind, Bill Clinton just went to the hospital this week for having the flu.
[00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:33.679]  So he either didn't get his flu shot, and he's anti-vaccine, or the flu shot doesn't even work and he's still in the hospital.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:42.719]  Why would we create a vaccine for a flu that is not even infecting human beings, may never infect human beings, and we don't even know if it would be deadly if it did.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.539]  This is clip number one.
[00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:43.980]  Let's watch.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.440]  Bird flu.
[00:47:46.119 --> 00:47:50.639]  Is this report out of Louisiana worrisome, and if so, why?
[00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:57.969]  Well, it's one more sign that the drumbeat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat.
[00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:04.349]  So we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks.
[00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.389]  We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states.
[00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.630]  16 states have outbreaks in cattle.
[00:48:09.869 --> 00:48:14.889]  In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive.
[00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.789]  And now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:28.659]  And this is almost certainly a significant undercount because we have not been doing nearly enough testing, so we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.420]  But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill.
[00:48:31.639 --> 00:48:45.659]  But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.
[00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:47.860]  Bird flu has been around for a long time.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.699]  About 30 years.
[00:48:48.739 --> 00:48:49.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:55.679]  But it hasn't been a major issue in humans because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.500]  But now there is this mutation.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.699]  And there's another concern now major too, which is that we are in flu season.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.559]  And it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.
[00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:07.800]  Something called reassortment.
[00:49:08.039 --> 00:49:08.539]  That's right.
[00:49:08.719 --> 00:49:09.139]  That's right.
[00:49:09.139 --> 00:49:12.599]  Where things change because of one illness becoming another illness.
[00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:14.300]  Now there's a new word they're using called reassortment.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:14.820]  Pay attention.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.840]  You're going to hear it a lot.
[00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:16.500]  Virus.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.219]  That's right.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.099]  And so the viruses could exchange genes.
[00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:21.739]  You could develop a new hybrid virus.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:29.440]  And if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.
[00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:33.579]  What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.599]  Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.900]  The first is to get testing out there.
[00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:46.079]  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.800]  It just means that we aren't looking for it.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:50:00.800]  We should be having rapid tests, home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.
[00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:06.280]  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID where we were dealing with a new virus.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.280]  We didn't have a vaccine.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:17.400]  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine.
[00:50:17.719 --> 00:50:21.320]  However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine.
[00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:22.780]  There's research done on it.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.400]  They could get this authorized now.
[00:50:24.579 --> 00:50:30.239]  So there's already a vaccine ready for this bird flu, even though we know that the flu vaccines...
[00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:34.030]  Are hit or miss at best every single year.
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:40.829]  And this hasn't even really become a human illness yet.
[00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:47.650]  Remember how they said during the last pandemic that they already had done a bunch of research on the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines.
[00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:52.269]  We need only cut the bureaucratic tape, the red tape.
[00:50:53.090 --> 00:51:00.949]  And then we'll be able to mass produce and inoculate the American people and the people of the world, for that matter, with these vaccines.
[00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.889]  They're trying to do the same exact thing again.
[00:51:03.889 --> 00:51:12.849]  It's unbelievable that this media and these leftists have the audacity to do this after we know what happened in 2020. I just hope that Donald Trump doesn't fall for it again, folks.
[00:51:14.219 --> 00:51:15.079]  We're coming up on a break.
[00:51:15.199 --> 00:51:18.559]  In the next hour, we're going to get into more news, clips, analysis.
[00:51:18.739 --> 00:51:24.500]  We're going to talk a little bit about the H-1B visa stuff, more about this pandemic, more about World War III, more about escalations in Ukraine.
[00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:27.320]  In the meantime, please go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.300]  You can get our supplements, our gummies, for up to 50% off.
[00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:52.280]  Go there now, support us, and be the reason Alex will always be on the air.
[00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:00.730]  The belief that somehow or other government can spend money at nobody's expense.
[00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:14.090]  I don't know how many of you have ever heard of a wonderful description of government that was made by a French economist by the name of Frédéric Bastiat about 150 years ago.
[00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:22.170]  He said, government is that fiction whereby everybody believes that he can live at the expense of everybody else.
[00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.869]  And that is the free lunch myth.
[00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:35.809]  The myth that somehow or other government can provide goods and services, can spend money at nobody's expense.
[00:52:36.469 --> 00:52:42.489]  Now the particular form which that myth takes is very specific.
[00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:44.809]  It has two parts.
[00:52:45.469 --> 00:53:01.929]  One part is the belief that somehow or other you can tax business Without consumers or workers or individuals paying for it, somehow business is a big source, a big cornucopia out there that can be taxed at no cost.
[00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:07.909]  And the other way to form the myth takes is that you can create money at no cost.
[00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:14.869]  That if you turn the printing press, if you produce those greenbacks, that will enable people to become richer with nobody becoming poorer.
[00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:17.369]  Well, let me look at first problem.
[00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:18.670]  Can you tax business?
[00:53:19.489 --> 00:53:20.349]  What's business?
[00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:23.510]  There's no business to be taxed.
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.210]  There are people.
[00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.110]  Only people can pay taxes.
[00:53:28.809 --> 00:53:30.550]  Can I tax this floor?
[00:53:30.809 --> 00:53:32.170]  Can I tax the building?
[00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.409]  The building can't pay taxes.
[00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:36.550]  Only people can pay taxes.
[00:53:36.809 --> 00:53:41.449]  So when you talk about a tax on business, it has to be paid by somebody.
[00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:49.130]  Either it's paid by the stockholder, or it's paid by the customer, or it's paid by the worker.
[00:53:49.489 --> 00:53:51.210]  There's no other way it can come from.
[00:53:51.699 --> 00:54:06.539]  There's no Santa Claus, no tooth fairy that's going to provide a source by which the government can spend money that doesn't come from somebody.
[00:54:06.679 --> 00:54:07.559]  Somebody has to pay.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:19.130]  And yet, Over and over again you hear the claim, oh, we must not increase taxes on individuals, we'll increase taxes on business.
[00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:25.030]  In connection with the current discussion of social security, this fiction arises.
[00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:32.909]  There is a fiction that the social security tax is half on the individual and half on the employer.
[00:54:34.599 --> 00:54:41.260]  That the individual only pays 5.75%, the employer pays an equal amount?
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.039]  That's nonsense.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.440]  That's bookkeeping.
[00:54:44.539 --> 00:54:45.420]  That's not economics.
[00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:46.659]  That's not reality.
[00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:51.500]  The part that the employer pays is part of his wage cost.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:55:05.750]  If an employer considers whether it's worth his while to hire an additional worker, he has to consider as part of his cost not only what he pays to the worker, But also the extra taxes he will have to pay to the government.
[00:55:06.449 --> 00:55:20.409]  It makes no difference to the employer at all if he pays the worker a bigger check and the worker pays a larger part of that directly to the government, or he pays the worker a smaller check, but in addition has to send a check to Washington.
[00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:25.789]  What matters to him is the total number of dollars it costs him to hire an additional person.
[00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:35.639]  So the fact is, the logic is, the reason is, That the tax, the so-called tax on the employer, is paid by the employee.
[00:55:36.739 --> 00:55:45.659]  Now this has always been clear from economic reasoning, general economic reasoning, but it has also been subjected to empirical tests.
[00:55:46.639 --> 00:56:09.110]  In a book even from that tempo of belief in greater and bigger government, the Brookings Institution, In Washington published a couple of years ago demonstrated empirically That the tax on the employer was really paid by the employee,
[00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:10.489]  that it was shifted to the employee.
[00:56:10.489 --> 00:56:11.449]  Folks, we're coming up on a one-minute break.
[00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:14.949]  We're going to get into more analysis and breaking news on the other side.
[00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.130]  That's Milton Friedman there you're listening to.
[00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:30.309]  He was the first, the greatest economist at speaking in front of college audiences, taking questions from college audiences, and just totally wrecking any criticisms of capitalism.
[00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:33.079]  I mean, if you think Ben Shapiro's good at Debating.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:43.920]  If you think Steven Crowder is good at debating or Charlie Kirk's good at debating or Miley Yiannopoulos is good at debating, Milton Friedman was incredibly talented at debating on economics and the virtues of capitalism specifically.
[00:56:44.139 --> 00:56:46.039]  Stay with us for more on the other side.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geyser, your host for the next two hours and 54 minutes.
[00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:05.000]  For the last hour of this broadcast, we will be taking your calls, so please keep your phone close by.
[00:57:05.119 --> 00:57:08.559]  Alex Jones will be back in studio this week, either tomorrow or Thursday.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.219]  If not tomorrow, I will be hosting as well.
[00:57:12.739 --> 00:57:17.159]  I hope you all had a Merry Christmas and are geared up for a Happy New Year.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:33.599]  At the end of the last segment, we talked a lot about this bird flu hype that's going on and how it's basically the same thing as the climate hoax and how the leftists focus on catastrophes yet to come as distractions for their catastrophe of leadership that is happening right now before our eyes.
[00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:43.159]  I want to wrap this up, tie it back into what happened in 2020, and then get into some more news and analysis based on what's been breaking over the course of the last seven days or so.
[00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:49.239]  So former State Department official says Americans will soon learn COVID origins truth.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.380]  I'm going to play clip number 11 here in a moment.
[00:57:51.809 --> 00:58:08.210]  Revelations that senior U.S. intelligence officials in the early days of the virus pandemic suppressed research indicating a Chinese lab leak as the origin of COVID-19 surfaced in a new Wall Street Journal report titled Behind Closed Doors, the spy world scientists who argued COVID was a lab leak late this week.
[00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:14.469]  Let's watch clip number 11. A lot of big stories this week.
[00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.969]  For a Christmas week, usually Christmas is a slow week.
[00:58:17.969 --> 00:58:18.710]  Not this year.
[00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.949]  Not this year.
[00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:36.670]  The Wall Street Journal with a big report on how the deep state has been working very hard to suffocate all of the evidence that points directly at a lab leak for COVID. That the Wuhan Institute of Virology, funded by American taxpayers without your knowledge, was the source of all of this.
[00:58:37.449 --> 00:58:40.630]  The intelligence blob, as the Daily Caller puts it.
[00:58:41.469 --> 00:58:48.510]  Was boxing out all the lab leak people who wanted to tell the truth to the American people who wanted to even tell Joe Biden.
[00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:50.130]  But they stopped them.
[00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:51.170]  They stopped them.
[00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:51.949]  You can't tell Joe.
[00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.650]  He might tell someone else.
[00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.989]  That was the big plan.
[00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:58.849]  That was the conspiracy.
[00:58:58.849 --> 00:59:00.090]  That was the cover-up.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:11.440]  So the investigation by the Wall Street Journal's Michael Gordon and Warren Strobel shows the disagreements, so-called disagreements, within the intelligence community over COVID origins.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:20.880]  But apparently an investigation by the Wall Street Journal shows that the disagreements among intelligence experts over what should be included in the report ran deeper than is publicly known.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:32.559]  Three scientists at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, part of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, conducted a scientific study that concluded that COVID-19 was manipulated in a laboratory.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.780]  So they already had this knowledge, and we've known this the whole time.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.920]  I mean, Alex Jones knew it before it even happened.
[00:59:40.809 --> 00:59:59.670]  But experts like Brett Weinstein and others, scientists who actually looked at the genetic makeup of this virus, were saying as early as the summer of 2020 on Joe Rogan's podcast and when they tried to censor incessantly over disinformation or misinformation or dangerous health claims about ivermectin and the virus,
[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:05.590]  They said, look, we've looked at this virus, and it's very obvious that it's been manipulated by people.
[01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:10.389]  And you can go and you can watch the three-hour conversation and the explanation that's very good.
[01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:14.030]  A layman like myself could understand what Brett Weinstein was saying.
[01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:17.269]  But now we know.
[01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:20.750]  Now we have the Wall Street Journal reporting that it was manufactured.
[01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:25.590]  Now we have proof that the intelligence community understood that it was manufactured.
[01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:28.639]  Do you want to talk about Joe Biden's legacy?
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.079]  He's the one that said it was racist for us to shut off all transit from China while this was spreading.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:54.550]  While we know that China was not allowing any domestic travel in and out of Wuhan, but allowing international travel in and out of Wuhan to spread this virus intentionally throughout the world, this was all an orchestrated, manufactured plan By the CCP and the leftist element of the deep state to undermine the efficacy of Trump's administration,
[01:00:55.110 --> 01:01:03.650]  the support for Trump's administration and his reelection campaign in 2020. Plus, they wanted to totally change the way that elections were done using this pandemic as an excuse.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:10.519]  Then they wanted to slide in Joe Biden and justify the expansion of government powers in a crisis like this.
[01:01:10.639 --> 01:01:16.800]  By making it as bad as possible, as dangerous as possible, as terrifying as possible in the eyes of the American people.
[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.429]  And it's not like it's over.
[01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:31.489]  I mean, just in the last two weeks, they attempted to pass a $1.2 trillion omnibus bill, which would have expanded the federal government's powers to respond to another pandemic, as if they hadn't learned anything from the first one.
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:36.389]  I guess what they learned was that it was so great for them, so they wanted to double down on it, despite what the American people experienced.
[01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:42.570]  And not only that, they wanted to fund no less than 12 biolabs throughout the world.
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:46.750]  Biolabs very similar to the ones in which Metabiota was involved with.
[01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:52.570]  Of course, that company was funded $23 million by the DOD and invested in by Hunter Biden and Rosemont Seneca.
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:02:15.489]  But they want to fund biolabs just like the one in Wuhan, responsible for the manufacturing of this virus, ultimately leading to a manufactured pandemic where Not only all Americans, but human beings across the entire globe were officially the victims of a bioweapon.
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.489]  And it was obvious that it was very intentional for the CCP to do this.
[01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:33.039]  Why else would they have covered it up from the time it leaked in September until at least January, when they are obligated by WHO to Notify and alert the world when something like this was happening.
[01:02:33.179 --> 01:02:44.539]  Why else would they shut off all domestic flights to and from Wuhan, but enable and allow international flights in and out of Wuhan to intentionally spread it all over the world except within China?
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:03:07.349]  And right now what we're witnessing I've just been going through all these different documents.
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.130]  There's a lot of people who have been covering this for years now.
[01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:20.969]  What I understand about Dr. Richard Ebride is that he is, in a sense, probably the most vocal critic of Anthony Fauci.
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.769]  Richard, is it true that people call you Anthony Fauci's worst nightmare?
[01:03:26.949 --> 01:03:27.510]  Yes.
[01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:32.429]  From what I've read, it seems like he hates Anthony Fauci, and Anthony Fauci hates him.
[01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:38.030]  It's not even just about COVID. It's been happening for the last 20 years between the two of them.
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:50.570]  We have willful, deliberate misfeasance that likely caused a pandemic, killed 20 million and cost 25 trillion dollars.
[01:03:50.909 --> 01:03:56.929]  Against that context, it is unsurprising that individuals would prefer a lie.
[01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:04.230]  Neil Harrison is a scientist at Columbia, and he was tracking COVID since the beginning.
[01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:10.670]  Scientists don't generally like to criticize other scientists, and we really don't like to use the F word.
[01:04:10.909 --> 01:04:12.050]  What's the F word?
[01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.110]  Fraud.
[01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.650]  I said the F word.
[01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:25.329]  And he's now helping a congressional investigation into the origins of COVID and the potential of a cover-up.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.599]  Hi, this is Emily Kopp.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.420]  I'm a reporter with U.S. Right to Know in Washington.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:41.599]  So Emily Kopp is a health reporter and around 2021 she shifted into covering the origins of COVID. I felt like I had a moral obligation to get answers.
[01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:54.780]  She's been responsible for a lot of the freedom of information documents and her main focus has been sort of piecing together the behind-the-scenes communications between Fauci and this group of scientists.
[01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:57.110]  I'm going to go see Charles Rixie.
[01:04:58.289 --> 01:05:00.030]  What do I need to know about him?
[01:05:00.369 --> 01:05:09.530]  Rixie is part of this group called Drastic, which is this sort of decentralized investigative team comprised of scientists, web sleuths, and veterans.
[01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:12.550]  That's me in the black shirt.
[01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:22.699]  I was really sick when I got COVID. And then a former Marine reached out to me and said, you should look into the origin of the virus.
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:31.199]  And from that date, in 2020, I shifted my attention full-time to figuring out what the origin of the virus was.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.739]  He believes COVID was engineered in a lab.
[01:05:35.559 --> 01:05:42.059]  U.S. policies in place that were put in place to protect the public from laboratory-generated pandemics.
[01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:44.659]  And those policies were violated.
[01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:48.050]  Repeatedly and flagrantly.
[01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:51.730]  This issue has provoked a lot of anger in everybody.
[01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:58.670]  Scientists like Bryce Nichols and Justin Kinney are part of a movement for biosafety and are big critics of Fauci.
[01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:03.690]  Fauci's legacy is tied to this type of dangerous research activity.
[01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:14.610]  Doctors have a responsibility to do no harm, but Anthony Fauci was putting the life of everyone on the planet at risk without their consent.
[01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:16.349]  So we have all of the evidence.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:26.800]  All of the evidence that Fauci lied, that it was actually gain of function research, which we outsourced to China because it became illegal under the Obama administration to do gain of function research in the United States.
[01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:34.739]  We know based on evidence that the Bidens were personally invested in this type of research through Metabiota in Ukraine specifically.
[01:06:35.219 --> 01:06:55.420]  And we saw in the last 10 days through this proposed $1.2 trillion omnibus bill that the neoconservatives and the leftists, the Democrats and the traditional Republicans, the Uniparty totally supported the notion that we expand everything that caused all of the disasters that occurred in 2020 because they love a crisis that expands and conglomerates their power.
[01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:13.500]  I mean, if you thought 9-11 was bad, with a terrorist attack happening in the United States that we knew was going to happen, with all the classified details around it, with the report which just doesn't add up, with the fact that Building 7 was clearly a controlled demolition, Which ushered in the Patriot Act,
[01:07:13.639 --> 01:07:36.840]  which instead of actually capturing and neutralizing our enemies, we've had countless terrorist attacks since then, only served to empower the government to spy on the American people, not just notably revealed by Edward Snowden, but also the same laws and procedures and processes weaponized by the deep state to spy on Trump's campaign illegally based on lies for secret warrants in FISA courts.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.219]  That's all because of the crisis of 9-11.
[01:07:40.719 --> 01:07:48.800]  Its corruption expanded decades into the future, undermining the interests and wishes of the American people at every step of the way.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:57.559]  Whether it's the government spying on you, or your wife, or your journalists, or the person that you want to vote for, it rippled seemingly into eternity into the future.
[01:07:57.679 --> 01:07:59.280]  And we still suffer the consequences of that.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.039]  Do you think that just because some of the elements of the Patriot Act expired, the government stopped doing it?
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.969]  Do you think just because The public became aware of MKUltra.
[01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.510]  The government just shut it all down.
[01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.530]  Or did they repurpose it and rename it?
[01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.650]  That's what they do.
[01:08:15.869 --> 01:08:20.109]  Just like BlackRock didn't stop doing environmental sustainability and governance scores.
[01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.670]  They didn't stop doing ESG scores.
[01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:23.630]  They just changed the name of them.
[01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:26.050]  They changed the name of MKUltra.
[01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:32.789]  They changed the name of DEI. They changed the name of ESG. They changed the name of whatever they're doing under the Patriot Act.
[01:08:34.289 --> 01:08:41.810]  We're good to go.
[01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:06.270]  It was so much data that there simply were not enough people who could manually comb through it all to get the information that they need.
[01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:23.890]  But now that we have quantum computing and we have artificial general intelligence on the cusp of being manifest in the world if it isn't already secretly being operated by the government, now the artificial intelligence on behalf of the deep state can actually read all of your texts in emails and phone calls.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.800]  And browser history and data.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:34.000]  And not only can it use it and weaponize that information against you in the court of law, but it can create profiles of your psychology.
[01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:44.239]  And then it can use profiles of your psychology in order to inform the deep state what the best propaganda approach would be in order to sway the minds and hearts of the most American people possible.
[01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:54.810]  Then all of a sudden you have this technology in every school and every institution informing our politicians on what policies to vote for, informing our teachers on what to teach in schools.
[01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:04.710]  And thus we have the artificial intelligence takeover all because of a ripple effect of bad policy from 9-11.
[01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:11.899]  So if you think that's bad, just wait until you see what they've done with the pandemic in 2020 and what they want to continue to do.
[01:10:11.979 --> 01:10:14.899]  I mean, we know that they lied about the origins of the virus.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.500]  We know that they lied about the level of danger of the virus.
[01:10:18.619 --> 01:10:21.520]  We know that they lied about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.
[01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:25.779]  We know that they lied about the efficacy of social distancing.
[01:10:26.039 --> 01:10:28.260]  We know that they lied about two weeks to slow the spread.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.479]  We know that they lied about the efficacy of the masks.
[01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:46.789]  We know that they shut down the entire economy for virtually no reason, and we know that they used the pandemic as an excuse to change all of the laws in key states around elections to make it easier to cheat and usher in Joe Biden against Donald Trump.
[01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:51.329]  And we know that it was all done on purpose, and everyone suffered.
[01:10:51.449 --> 01:11:00.529]  Every 1% that unemployment goes up in the United States, at least 40,000 people die from heart-related stress issues, aneurysms, things like that, stress-related deaths.
[01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:17.770]  Imagine how many people died because of the stress, the economic stress of what they allowed to happen with the response in 2020. Imagine the number of people dying now of cancer because they didn't go in for their elective checkups or surgeries or operations for the cancer that they had.
[01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:22.050]  They didn't get tested or treated for cancer during the pandemic, during that summer.
[01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.090]  Nobody wanted to go to the hospital.
[01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.710]  That's where you catch COVID. That's where all the COVID patients are.
[01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:26.270]  Don't go there.
[01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.350]  So just get cancer instead and then die.
[01:11:29.659 --> 01:11:42.960]  After all of the corruption and death that was caused of the 2020 pandemic, our government, instead of saying sorry or walking back all of the policies that resulted in the millions upon millions of people who died, doubled down in a $1.2 trillion omnibus bill.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:12:00.750]  And I know the bill didn't pass, but the fact that our establishment political class had the audacity to suggest expanding the very policies which resulted in the death of millions upon millions of American people Goes to show where their true interests lie.
[01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:02.750]  What their true motives are.
[01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:08.189]  And now we've got Bill Gates linked vaccine delivered through mosquito bite carrying bioengineered malaria causing parasite.
[01:12:09.619 --> 01:12:15.359]  Reports from TheHill.com on how censorship campaigns failed to kill the COVID origin theory.
[01:12:15.359 --> 01:12:19.539]  They tried to censor the truth which they are now openly admitting in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.859]  And it's all a distraction.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.859]  They want you scared of the climate.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.460]  They want you scared of bird flu.
[01:12:24.619 --> 01:12:30.359]  But they don't want you thinking that we're going to World War III. They don't want you thinking that there's any issue with our monetary system or economy.
[01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:37.119]  Despite the fact that in clip number 19 here, Yellen says extraordinary measures to avoid default will start in mid-January.
[01:12:37.279 --> 01:12:39.000]  Let's watch clip number 19 right now.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:47.319]  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says the U.S. will reach the debt limit sometime after January 14th.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:57.100]  In a letter sent to Congress yesterday, she says the Treasury will have to take extraordinary measures to pay Washington's bills on time, and in full, once that happens.
[01:12:57.159 --> 01:13:04.659]  That will make addressing the debt limit a top priority for the early days of the Trump administration and the 119th Congress.
[01:13:05.899 --> 01:13:15.600]  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. will reach its borrowing limit in mid-January, which will necessitate the use of extraordinary measures to keep the federal government from defaulting.
[01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:19.380]  You know, it seems like this didn't used to happen all the time.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.880]  There was in the 90s a very long instance of a government shutdown because of a budget that couldn't be passed.
[01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:31.729]  But it used to be an incredibly rare phenomenon that our government couldn't come to a deal, couldn't pass a budget.
[01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:36.409]  Now it's like it's happening every single year that a budget is to be passed.
[01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:42.050]  Why is it that it's more and more difficult for our leaders to pass a budget?
[01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:51.890]  Why is it that it's more and more difficult for the Federal Reserve to enact effective policy to mitigate things like inflation or unemployment issues?
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:57.180]  Or the inaffordability of housing.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:03.100]  Well, it's becoming more and more difficult because we're deeper and deeper in the hole of this Ponzi scheme.
[01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:10.920]  It's more and more difficult to keep up the scam when it's reached this level and now we have panic.
[01:14:14.439 --> 01:14:16.000]  Do you think that this is going to go away?
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:28.340]  Oh, we're just going to have a period in the United States of strong economic development and robust growth in GDP and The ceasing of inflation and our dollar is going to become more robust and stronger.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.800]  They can enact policies that would strengthen the dollar temporarily.
[01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:39.979]  But inevitably, this is just going to get more and more difficult and worse and worse until we have a total change in our monetary system altogether.
[01:14:39.979 --> 01:14:47.460]  But that's going to be impossible if we continue to expand our debt limit and print money for the sake of funding wars all over the world.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.300]  Whether between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, Iran, China and Taiwan.
[01:14:55.619 --> 01:14:56.960]  The Indo-Pacific region?
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.140]  We can't fix our money if we're funding all these conflicts.
[01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:14.220]  Putin calls for Ukraine war peace talks to be held in Slovakia, while Secretary Blinken is griping about human rights entitlement all over the world, pretty much everywhere except for in the United States of America.
[01:15:14.359 --> 01:15:23.159]  This is clip number 31 of Blinken speaking on the importance of acknowledging the human rights we're all entitled to, even in America.
[01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:29.729]  From the outside of this administration, President Biden has made advancing human rights a top priority.
[01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:39.109]  That's simply because everyone everywhere is entitled to these rights, including people in the United States.
[01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:45.210]  And it's because we know that a world where human rights are respected is profoundly in our interest.
[01:15:45.829 --> 01:15:55.500]  As the last four years have underscored, countries that respect human rights are, on the whole, more stable, More secure, more peaceful.
[01:15:55.899 --> 01:15:57.659]  They're more reliable partners.
[01:15:58.119 --> 01:16:00.859]  They're better stewards of our shared planet.
[01:16:01.779 --> 01:16:13.060]  At the same time, we've been very open about the fact that the United States has not, does not, always live up to these standards, either at home or in our relationships around the world.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:22.039]  Rather than try to hide these shortcomings, rather than trying to ignore these tensions, we grapple with them, out in the open.
[01:16:23.029 --> 01:16:33.489]  Striving over years, over decades, even over generations, to close the gap between our principles and our practice.
[01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:44.609]  The conviction that we have a strategic interest in upholding human rights is one of the things that distinguishes democracies like ours from autocracies.
[01:16:44.869 --> 01:16:53.340]  Particularly those autocracies that are trying to rewrite the rules We write the rights that have defined the international system since the end of the Second World War.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:02.680]  Always so concerned with the international interests of other countries, whether he's coming out and talking about human rights in Kenya or other African nations, or he's visiting Ukraine.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:10.640]  He's always advocating on behalf of the interests of foreign governments, but we really know that he's advocating on behalf of the political interests of our own deep state.
[01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:13.899]  And so many Americans believe this.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.500]  I'm going to show you clip number 24 in a moment here.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.779]  So many Americans believe the lies of Secretary Blinken as he performs.
[01:17:21.779 --> 01:17:26.159]  Keep on rocking in the free world by Neil Young in front of an audience in Ukraine.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:42.420]  Which canceled all of its democratic elections and is now conscripting its populace up to the age of 50 and 60, even those with mental disorders, to fight in the meat grinder for no reason in an unwinnable war that was waged for no reason whatsoever other than our own provocations of Russia.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.739]  But we're the ones in a cult.
[01:17:45.899 --> 01:17:46.500]  MAG is in a cult.
[01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:51.840]  Not the left who loves war all over the place or who believes in a flu that doesn't exist yet or climate change which hasn't happened yet.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.739]  They're not in a cult.
[01:17:53.859 --> 01:17:54.659]  We're the ones in a cult.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.600]  This is David Pakman being irritating as hell on clip number 24. Let's watch and unpack.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.920]  Is MAGA the largest cult in human history?
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:12.680]  Yeah, I think it's clear that as as loosely defined in this way, as we've been talking about the Trump cult, I think it is the biggest cult.
[01:18:12.899 --> 01:18:21.439]  You know, if you think about even like a popular band, This guy was photographed in the White House at the Christmas party with Hunter Biden.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:29.000]  So unless someone can tell me otherwise, I kind of do think that this is the biggest cult in history.
[01:18:29.199 --> 01:18:38.739]  If I Google what is the largest cult in history, I found a thing about the four peoples.
[01:18:38.899 --> 01:18:41.039]  Yeah, People's Temple had 900 people.
[01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.189]  Man, now these are tiny.
[01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:45.010]  Heaven's Gate.
[01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:46.029]  No, no.
[01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:52.050]  I think that by almost any definition, the Trump cult is the biggest cult.
[01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:54.770]  I don't think he even understands what the definition of a cult is.
[01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:57.670]  I mean, there's several parameters that have to be met in order for something to be a cult.
[01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:02.890]  First of all, it has to have a supreme leader who can never be wrong.
[01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:07.229]  MAGA Republicans have criticized Trump, Elon Musk, and others countless occasions.
[01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:13.250]  Whether it's Musk for the H-1B policies that he advocates, or Neuralink, whether it's Trump because of Operation Warp Speed.
[01:19:13.329 --> 01:19:14.689]  I mean, we've been very critical of our leader.
[01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:22.489]  And if you leave the MAGA cult, you're not excommunicated from friendship and family by MAGA people.
[01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:25.109]  But if you leave the leftist cult, you certainly are, folks.
[01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:27.289]  More groundbreaking analysis on the other side.
[01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.090]  Stay tuned.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geyser, your host this evening for the next two hours and 27 minutes.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.039]  In the final hour of this broadcast, we will be taking your calls, so please keep your phones close by.
[01:19:48.439 --> 01:20:02.159]  You know, I'm looking at these stacks here, and I'm just so perturbed by the audacity of the New World Order, by the audacity of the deep state, the political class the world over, which is endeavoring to conglomerate all political power into one New World government.
[01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.729]  And they'll never call it that.
[01:20:04.029 --> 01:20:10.850]  They might call it a new world order or some global solution or some uniting of nations.
[01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:13.989]  But that's what it's going to be.
[01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:32.340]  I mean, if all the economies of the world are run by international monetary funds, if all the policies of the world are run by international committees like the UN or the WEF, If all the wars of the world are waged by international communities,
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:35.260]  then what is that if not a one world government?
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.140]  A new world order?
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.539]  A globalist deep state?
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.319]  I know a lot of people like to point the finger and blame one thing or the other.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.479]  The left likes to blame white people or straight men.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.000]  The fringes of the right like to blame the Jews for everything.
[01:20:56.539 --> 01:21:07.300]  The fact of the matter is, it's a political class that encompasses the interests of all the leaders of the world at the expense of the interests of their own peoples.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:13.140]  It's not just one group that's capable of evil, it's all groups that are capable of evil.
[01:21:13.319 --> 01:21:23.500]  And political classes throughout history have aspired to mass conspiracy, to subjugate their own people in perpetuity.
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:41.500]  While they complain about a bird flu which hasn't happened or climate change which has yet to occur, we've got record increases in U.S. homelessness in 2024. Homelessness increased by a record 18% over the last year, says the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
[01:21:41.539 --> 01:21:46.439]  while Joe Biden brags about record job creation and record low inflation.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:50.119]  We've got bankruptcies up at least 20% year over year.
[01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:54.529]  And the people who are employed are underemployed.
[01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:58.270]  They're working two part-time jobs instead of one job in whatever they're experts at.
[01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:06.569]  We've got conflicts on the verge of breaking out all over the world that could lead to the total extermination of humanity itself.
[01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:10.729]  And it's such a level of incompetence that it seems almost intentional.
[01:22:12.329 --> 01:22:19.090]  Our own government can't even decide what to tell you about drones being sighted over the tri-state area, Ohio or Southern California.
[01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:25.409]  Our own government can't even decide what to tell you about the fact that COVID-19 was manufactured.
[01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:33.810]  Our own government can't even agree that we should pass a balanced budget.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:58.319]  Our own so-called experts in banking can't even agree that we have an unsustainable monetary system with a fiat currency backed by nothing except for ensuring that all of our enemies trade oil in our currency and we have to do everything we can to force them with our military to do so resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people decade after decade after decade after decade ever since we went off the gold standard.
[01:22:59.899 --> 01:23:04.659]  And I told you last week About these eggs, they're talking about the bird flu.
[01:23:04.859 --> 01:23:08.479]  It's a manufactured, orchestrated food shortage.
[01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:15.060]  I said, how many examples have you seen of chicken coop after chicken coop after chicken coop going up in flames?
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.699]  Massive shortages in chicken.
[01:23:18.199 --> 01:23:28.020]  Even Pete Terry's is leaving notes for people here in Texas saying, sorry, we had to raise our prices on chicken, but the price of chicken has gone up because of not demand, but supply issues.
[01:23:30.119 --> 01:23:38.039]  I told you that my mother-in-law was having issues getting eggs in California after Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency because one person in Louisiana got the flu.
[01:23:39.659 --> 01:23:45.079]  And right now, on my desk, one week after that, Tyson Poultry Facility catches fire one dead.
[01:23:45.199 --> 01:23:47.060]  Raw Egg Nationalist on Infowars.com.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:52.359]  A Tyson Food Poultry Facility caught fire on Friday after an explosion that left a woman dead.
[01:23:52.619 --> 01:23:52.800]  What?!
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:24:00.039]  An explosion at the facility in southwest Georgia caused a fire that raged for three hours before it was put out.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.239]  Explosion also caused a wall to collapse and fall on the cab of an 18-wheeler parked outside the plant.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.020]  The wife of a truck driver who was sleeping inside was killed.
[01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:11.539]  She has been identified as Bajarma Badozopov.
[01:24:12.659 --> 01:24:13.939]  61 of Las Vegas.
[01:24:14.439 --> 01:24:15.960]  Two more were injured in the blaze.
[01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:23.579]  And I know the crew can find B-roll, they don't have to, of countless examples over the last four years of chicken coops going up in flames.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.880]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.420]  What is causing this rash of fires that's destroying the supply of chicken?
[01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:38.579]  All while the deep state and the mainstream media constantly attack things like raw eggs or raw milk or bird flu, bird flu, bird flu.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.439]  You're not supposed to want to eat chicken, I guess.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.039]  All while Bill Gates and other globalists constantly...
[01:24:44.419 --> 01:24:47.420]  Deride cows as 6% of the world's methane.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.399]  And advocate for artificial meat, which we know on virtually every scalable level.
[01:24:55.439 --> 01:25:01.840]  Every quantifiable level is far worse for you than just regular beef.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.720]  The amount of sodium they have to put in that, the carbs they have to put in it to make it taste anything like food.
[01:25:07.239 --> 01:25:09.840]  Our future is lab-grown beef.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.720]  But there's nothing wrong with fluoride.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.020]  Another study finds a link between fluoride and lowered IQ. Another great post by Raw Egg Nationalist.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:34.909]  A meta study, a study of multiple studies, shows a clear link between prenatal exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ in children at age 7. How many more studies have to come out before we understand the atrazine in the water is a problem?
[01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:46.170]  How many more studies have to come out before we understand that fluoride in the water is harming IQ? How many more studies have to come out before we publicly acknowledge the fact that COVID-19 was manufactured in a foreign lab?
[01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:53.810]  I mean, this is the reason that people back RFK. I'm going to show you this report in a moment.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.819]  Breaking video, RFK Jr. pledges to fire corrupt FDA officials and hold them accountable.
[01:25:59.979 --> 01:26:00.680]  Let's run this report.
[01:26:03.979 --> 01:26:13.180]  Clearing out the corruption in your terms, would that mean clearing out the top-level federal service workers that are currently at the FDA and CDC? In some categories, I would say.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:13.960]  What does that look like?
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:14.199]  Yeah.
[01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:23.140]  In some categories of workers, there are entire departments, like the nutrition departments at FDA, that have to go.
[01:26:24.329 --> 01:26:27.189]  That are not doing their job.
[01:26:27.329 --> 01:26:28.689]  They're not protecting our kids.
[01:26:28.909 --> 01:26:33.010]  Why do we have fruit loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients?
[01:26:33.329 --> 01:26:35.449]  And you go to Canada and it's got two or three.
[01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:37.189]  Would you eliminate any of the agencies?
[01:26:40.289 --> 01:26:45.750]  To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn't be doing that.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.539]  I can get the corruption out of the agencies.
[01:26:48.539 --> 01:26:50.399]  That's what I've been doing for 40 years.
[01:26:50.619 --> 01:26:52.079]  I've sued all those agencies.
[01:26:52.079 --> 01:26:55.260]  I have a PhD in corporate corruption, and that's what I do.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:27:02.560]  And once they're not corrupt, once Americans are getting good science and are allowed to make their own choices, they're going to get a lot healthier.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.060]  Here is Robert F. Kennedy saying we must fire FTE workers who don't protect us.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:22.119]  And then other citizen journalists making very accurate on target points.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.000]  But we're in the middle of this health revolution.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.479]  It's happening.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.739]  They're already pulling seed oils out of a bunch of the foods.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.239]  They're already pulling fluoride out of things.
[01:27:29.779 --> 01:27:32.579]  They're already going in and pulling out the red dye without even a law.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.920]  All because we're pushing back and people are becoming aware of this.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.439]  And we're aware of the poison shots.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.960]  And we're aware of the 5G. And we're just aware of the glyphosate.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.920]  This is how they've been killing us.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.579]  And it's so exciting.
[01:27:43.779 --> 01:27:46.760]  So, here's these important clips, and I'll be right back with more news.
[01:27:46.899 --> 01:27:48.039]  Anne Harrison Smith, straight ahead.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:57.880]  Clearing out the corruption in your terms, would that mean clearing out the top-level federal service workers that are currently at the FDA and the CDC? In some categories, I would say.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.659]  What does that look like?
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:58.939]  Yeah.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:07.840]  In some categories of workers, there are entire departments, like the nutrition departments at FDA, that have to go.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.899]  That are not doing their job.
[01:28:12.039 --> 01:28:13.399]  They're not protecting our kids.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:20.159]  Why do we have fruit loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients and you go to Canada and it's got two or three?
[01:28:20.399 --> 01:28:21.899]  Would you eliminate any of the agencies?
[01:28:25.039 --> 01:28:30.479]  To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn't be doing that.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.260]  I can get the corruption out of the agencies.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.119]  That's what I've been doing for 40 years.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.819]  I've sued all those agencies.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.979]  I have a PhD in corporate corruption, and that's what I do.
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:47.369]  And once they're not corrupt, Once Americans are getting good science and are allowed to make their own choices, they're going to get a lot healthier.
[01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:51.149]  Heads up, my friends, these big food companies are getting slicker and slicker.
[01:28:51.289 --> 01:28:55.710]  They have changed the name of aspartame in food ingredients to amino-sweet.
[01:28:55.909 --> 01:29:03.350]  So if you're like me and want to stay away from artificial sweeteners and artificial things in your food, look for that amino-sweet in the labeling.
[01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:19.689]  Another little helpful hint, it's also manufactured by the same people that manufacture glyphosate, DBT, If I told you that my child was injured in a car accident, you would be so compassionate and worried.
[01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:25.029]  If I told you it was because the brakes had failed, you would be so shocked and appalled.
[01:29:25.789 --> 01:29:35.829]  If I told you that I found out that the manufacturers decided not to bother testing the brakes, you would be infuriated and tell me to sue them.
[01:29:36.899 --> 01:29:46.439]  If I told you that I found 60 studies that showed that they would fail, but they opted to cover it up instead, your head would be spinning.
[01:29:46.979 --> 01:30:04.779]  If I further told you that the government knew all about the dangers and that there were laws passed preventing anyone from being able to sue those manufacturers and that there were hundreds of thousands of injured and killed children,
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:14.020]  Due to that negligence, you would be so beyond yourself in trying to find any way possible to help these kids.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.220]  Now replace the word car with vaccine.
[01:30:19.279 --> 01:30:20.659]  How does it make you feel?
[01:30:21.779 --> 01:30:23.939]  Because this is a very real thing.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.340]  There are millions of parents out there fighting every single day for their voices to be heard.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.199]  The evidence is beyond question.
[01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:40.510]  These vaccines have not been properly tested and there are hundreds of studies connecting the vaccines and these injuries.
[01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.890]  It's a tough pill to swallow.
[01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:46.770]  How many more examples do we need to understand that the government doesn't care about you?
[01:30:47.390 --> 01:31:00.510]  How many more examples do we need to understand that the government is an organization that operates without a conscience and zero people within that government feel accountable for any of the crimes against humanity that it commits?
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.239]  And these corporations are the same way.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.960]  Some corporations are very good.
[01:31:05.079 --> 01:31:05.600]  Some are terrible.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:20.239]  Ford, for example, was an incredible corporation because through Henry Ford's greed and Ford's desire to make as much money as possible, they established the assembly line process and that made cars affordable for everyone in America in a way that was impossible before.
[01:31:21.039 --> 01:31:22.539]  Sometimes the greed is good.
[01:31:22.819 --> 01:31:26.520]  Sometimes the greed leads to the greater good.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.819]  That's what capitalism is for.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:34.859]  But what we have here is not an example of capitalism when we have the federal government and corporations in bed with one another.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.260]  That literally is fascism.
[01:31:36.399 --> 01:31:42.199]  When they conspire together to corner markets and then there's cross-pay and blackmail and leverage.
[01:31:42.579 --> 01:31:53.329]  When you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who can come out and threaten to break up a company like Google while simultaneously Advocating that Google censor political dissidents.
[01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:55.810]  Well, don't you think that Google might actually censor you then?
[01:31:56.050 --> 01:32:01.250]  If they don't want to be broken up by an Elizabeth Warren or a Joe Biden or a White House administration, then it's not favorable to the First Amendment?
[01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:07.050]  I mean, we literally have example after example of Democrats saying that the First Amendment really gets in the way.
[01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:07.470]  What was it?
[01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.510]  John Kerry recently said it?
[01:32:10.909 --> 01:32:12.289]  In fact, find that clip if you can.
[01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:15.750]  The First Amendment is so inconvenient.
[01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:39.050]  So when pharmaceutical companies do things like get special protections from the federal government, allow members of the political class, including elected officials, to be invested in them since they are publicly traded, give them the benefit of legalizing insider trading of these pharmaceutical companies.
[01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:48.649]  It's not capitalism when these corporations Have products or policies that result in the death of millions of people for the sake of a profit.
[01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:49.989]  That is fascism.
[01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:57.569]  In fact, every monopoly which has ever existed throughout history has existed with federal government sponsorship.
[01:32:57.949 --> 01:33:04.250]  I can't think of a single example of a monopoly which naturally occurred in a free market without the sponsorship of a federal government.
[01:33:05.979 --> 01:33:09.140]  You go back to the 80s and you look at what the pharmaceutical companies did like Bayer.
[01:33:09.319 --> 01:33:15.020]  They knew they were giving hemophiliacs and others who were receiving blood transfusions, HIV and hepatitis.
[01:33:15.239 --> 01:33:19.600]  They knew for years before they let the public know that they knew.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:33.260]  Fauci knew for years before the public was made aware, before parents were made aware that when they were treating their children with hemophilia for internal bleeding they were experiencing that they were simultaneously injecting them with a deadly virus, the most deadly virus ever.
[01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:43.789]  Can't blame capitalism for that when these corporations are overseen by the federal government and our political class is invested in these corporations.
[01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:52.369]  And why is it that we should act so surprised if they're willing to kill 10,000 hemophiliacs in the United States by injecting them intentionally, knowingly, with AIDS for the sake of a bottom line?
[01:33:52.909 --> 01:33:57.710]  Why is it that we should be so surprised when they give us a vaccine that doesn't work and harms us?
[01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:02.029]  When they encourage us to inoculate our children with experimental drugs?
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:14.720]  Why is it that we should be so surprised when they try to stifle the popularity of ivermectin because they just don't make enough money off of that?
[01:34:15.479 --> 01:34:17.859]  The left and the communists will say, oh, it's capitalism.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.420]  It's capitalism.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.279]  It only cares about money.
[01:34:19.359 --> 01:34:19.979]  It only cares about money.
[01:34:20.039 --> 01:34:22.840]  But that is fascism because it's the government doing it.
[01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:24.319]  It's the government invested in it.
[01:34:24.439 --> 01:34:26.779]  It's the government enacting the policies that allow this to happen.
[01:34:26.899 --> 01:34:31.300]  It is the government selling out the interests of the American people for the sake of the corporations that they're in bed with.
[01:34:33.979 --> 01:34:46.439]  And while economists brag about the benefits of a mixed economy, a balance between a free market and regulation, what they're really doing is advocating for a compromise between freedom and fascism.
[01:34:47.279 --> 01:34:51.359]  Would you ever exchange a little bit of freedom for a little bit of fascism?
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:54.939]  That's what it means to advocate for a mixed economy after all.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:08.220]  A little bit of government control over freedom for the sake of safety when we know that governments have been responsible for the genocide after genocide after genocide of millions upon millions of people over the course of the last 100 years.
[01:35:09.239 --> 01:35:15.659]  It's funny, if you actually add up the amount of people who died in wars over the course of the last 100 years, I believe it's like 1.3 billion.
[01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:20.739]  If you add up the number of people who have been killed by abortion since 1988, it's like 1.3 billion.
[01:35:22.630 --> 01:35:27.270]  All done, of course, in the safety of a medical office, whether it's Planned Parenthood or your doctor.
[01:35:31.449 --> 01:35:33.390]  See, these corporations aren't corporations at all.
[01:35:33.489 --> 01:35:36.510]  They're extensions of the government.
[01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:41.930]  Just like Ukraine is a cutout of the CIA, so are these major corporations cutouts of the deep state.
[01:35:44.329 --> 01:35:45.609]  They don't care about you.
[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:47.930]  They don't want you vaccinated and healthy.
[01:35:48.069 --> 01:35:51.329]  They don't put fluoride in the water because they want you to have nice teeth.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.000]  They don't put atrazine in the water.
[01:35:57.399 --> 01:35:58.619]  For good reasons.
[01:36:00.079 --> 01:36:02.300]  And if you think that they care about you, then just look.
[01:36:02.619 --> 01:36:06.460]  NATO state seeking more cemetery space for potential future war casualties.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:12.000]  Slovakia to cut Ukraine's power supply after Zelensky gas flow threats.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.539]  ISIS-linked terror plot foiled in Moscow.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.819]  That's another CIA cutout.
[01:36:15.939 --> 01:36:19.079]  I mean, aren't we funding ISIS and similar organizations in Syria right now?
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:30.159]  U.S.-U.K. intelligence services preparing terrorist attacks against Russian military bases in Syria and North Korea sending expendable human waves in Ukraine.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.939]  Let's watch this clip from John Kerry about how the First Amendment really is getting in the way.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:45.359]  And I think the dislike of and anguish over social media is just growing and growing and growing.
[01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:54.079]  And it's part of our problem, particularly in democracies, in terms of building consensus around any issue.
[01:36:54.319 --> 01:36:56.439]  It's really hard to govern today.
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:06.539]  The referees we used to have to determine what's a fact and what isn't a fact have been eviscerated to a certain degree.
[01:37:07.319 --> 01:37:10.500]  And people go and then people self-select.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.960]  Where they go for their news or for their information.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.340]  And then you just get into a vicious cycle.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:24.380]  So it's really, really hard, much harder to build consensus today than at any time in the 45, 50 years I've been involved in this.
[01:37:25.079 --> 01:37:37.180]  And there's a lot of discussion now about how you curb those entities in order to guarantee that you're going to have some accountability on facts, etc.
[01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:55.800]  But look, if people go to only one source and the source they go to is sick and has an agenda and they're putting out disinformation, our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just hammer it out of existence.
[01:37:56.039 --> 01:38:15.279]  So what we need is to Winning enough votes that you're free to be able to enact fascism,
[01:38:15.619 --> 01:38:16.500]  dictatorship.
[01:38:17.729 --> 01:38:20.210]  They love saying that they're fighting for democracy time and time again.
[01:38:20.409 --> 01:38:23.170]  Like I said a million times before, Ukraine is not a democracy.
[01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:26.369]  It is a cutout of the CIA and they have canceled their democratic elections.
[01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:29.069]  They love to claim that they love democracy in Taiwan.
[01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:44.970]  The fact of the matter is, it's just because Pelosi and others are so invested in NVIDIA and our deep state wants these processing chips as AI becomes the next weapon of mass destruction so badly that they're able to justify any military action on behalf of Taiwan, despite what expense it is to the interests of the American people.
[01:38:46.439 --> 01:38:51.779]  Germany's even using Magdeburg Christmas market attack to justify push for biometric surveillance expansion.
[01:38:51.979 --> 01:38:55.119]  Every single time there's a crisis, they use it to justify expansion.
[01:38:55.479 --> 01:39:03.119]  I want to show you clip number 32 of Roger Stone talking, for example, about how Apple would give away his data to the federal government, but not others.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:09.939]  Apple is selectively protecting the privacy of some and not others because, like I said, fascism.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.560]  They are all in bed together.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:17.119]  This is clip 32. Switching gears to Butler, people want answers on what happened that day.
[01:39:17.479 --> 01:39:19.180]  Yeah, I mean, this is very disturbing.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:25.119]  In 2015, I wrote a book on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[01:39:25.319 --> 01:39:30.649]  It's called The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ. It's a New York Times bestseller.
[01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.729]  But when I look at that, and I look at this, the parallels are uncanny.
[01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:39.590]  You have what appears to be the laydown of the Secret Service.
[01:39:39.829 --> 01:39:46.829]  The state, federal, and local police are all on different radio frequencies, so they can't speak to each other.
[01:39:47.909 --> 01:40:03.310]  The Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security know that there's a man with a gun inside the perimeter for 92 minutes, but they don't warn the president and he is not evacuated, which would be required under their protocols.
[01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:10.229]  The government sharpshooter actually gets the man who's allegedly the shooter in his sights.
[01:40:10.529 --> 01:40:13.289]  He sees that he has a gun pointed at the president.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:18.180]  But he waits until the man gets off eight shots before he shoots and kills him?
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.899]  That makes no sense.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.619]  Another violation of the rules.
[01:40:21.739 --> 01:40:24.520]  So I don't think we're being told the entire truth.
[01:40:24.779 --> 01:40:25.520]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:25.699 --> 01:40:30.479]  I'm not even certain that the man they accused of being the shooter is the shooter.
[01:40:30.579 --> 01:40:31.020]  He may be.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.340]  But I refuse to believe he had no Confederates.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.079]  We see him talking on a cell phone and still photographs.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.539]  Who's he talking to?
[01:40:39.289 --> 01:40:41.489]  Well, Apple won't turn over his phone records.
[01:40:41.649 --> 01:40:42.289]  That's funny.
[01:40:42.449 --> 01:40:46.310]  They turned my phone records over to Robert Mueller without a subpoena.
[01:40:46.569 --> 01:40:46.989]  Hmm.
[01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:47.590]  Strange.
[01:40:48.439 --> 01:40:49.060]  That is crazy.
[01:40:49.239 --> 01:40:51.560]  And the body was cremated right away.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.920]  Congress can't look at it.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.579]  It's gone automatically.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.340]  The problem is it's cycled in and out of the news.
[01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:04.779]  The egregious attempt on Trump's life in West Palm Beach even raises more questions.
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:07.939]  The man they accuse is supposedly indigent.
[01:41:08.119 --> 01:41:10.319]  He's behind in his child support payments.
[01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:11.859]  He's behind in his rape payments.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.760]  How did he afford to fly to Florida?
[01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:17.109]  And to Ukraine, and to Paris, and to London.
[01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:24.609]  How did he afford to put up a website trying to recruit mercenary soldiers for Ukraine?
[01:41:24.869 --> 01:41:27.409]  How did he obtain a weapon in Florida?
[01:41:27.569 --> 01:41:28.829]  He's a convicted felon.
[01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:33.630]  And in the case of the weapon, the serial numbers are filed off.
[01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:40.289]  How could he be there as long as he was without the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office noticing him?
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.439]  How did a Secret Service agent from five feet away shoot at him but miss him?
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.899]  How are these things possible?
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:54.859]  And now the Justice Department tells us he will never go to trial because there's so much evidence against him, we don't have time to go through it all.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:55.439]  Please.
[01:41:55.899 --> 01:41:56.479]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:57.539 --> 01:42:01.939]  Folks, we've got about a minute and 44 seconds left before the next short break.
[01:42:02.359 --> 01:42:18.300]  I've got a short Ayn Rand clip I'm going to show you at the top of the hour, and then I will be covering the news, getting into the H-1B, visas debate a little bit for the first 30 minutes to an hour of the Sunday Night Live broadcast, and then taking your calls in the final hour, starting at 7 p.m.
[01:42:18.439 --> 01:42:18.560]  Central.
[01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:21.319]  So please keep your phones close by, but we've proven...
[01:42:21.989 --> 01:42:39.430]  That the left and the deep state are manufacturing crisis after crisis after crisis to justify the expansion of their own power to sell out the interests of the American people for the sake of a new world order one world government and the subjugation of all of humanity based on a foundation of lies.
[01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:43.229]  They're going to do so with escalating war after war.
[01:42:44.430 --> 01:43:00.970]  With reducing your buying power over and over again and with leveraging these so-called private corporations to violate your rights, whether it's big pharma or whether it's the social media platforms which have the power to censor you and the government now is the White House now is protected if it requests this censorship according to the Supreme Court.
[01:43:02.529 --> 01:43:03.850]  The war has just begun.
[01:43:03.989 --> 01:43:05.689]  We did not win the war on November 5th.
[01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:07.270]  We started the war.
[01:43:07.529 --> 01:43:13.850]  And the greatest battles of this conflict and the Infowar are ahead of us, and that's why we need your support more now than ever.
