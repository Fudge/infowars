[00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.219]  We're back in the Infowars.com studios.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.480]  Well, that didn't take long.
[00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.400]  But still, the corporate media won't report it.
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.239]  They say The Onion and the National Gun Control Group, Robert the Democrats, got it.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.280]  But none of it was true.
[00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.699]  We launched the full transmission and restream also on the Infowars channel on X. They're exclusively.
[00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.060]  We've got tens of millions of viewers right now at Earl Alex Jones and over at the other channel.
[00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.929]  At AJM Live.
[00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:45.350]  So, we're doing this here for the great InfoWars folks over at man.video, InfoWars.com, and the vaunted InfoWars stream on X. So, tell everybody you know and those you don't know.
[00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:46.969]  Tune in now, now, now.
[00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.670]  Main transmission launches in T-minus 65 seconds.
[00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.689]  Initiate parallel connection.
[00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.390]  VR launch in T-minus 55 seconds.
[00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.269]  Thank you.
[00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:40.319]  We're good to go.
[00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:13.759]  InfoWars.
[00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.060]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.379]  Well, here we are back at the InfoWars studios.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.979]  I thought it was bought by The Onion.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.139]  I heard they bought it.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.379]  I heard they got it at an auction.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.319]  Turned out it was a rigged auction.
[00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.659]  Turned out the judge didn't authorize that auction.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.039]  Turns out they colluded on the bids beforehand and not told the real people that came to bid.
[00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.439]  Turns out people are...
[00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.750]  Really interested to find out what's going on.
[00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:54.030]  So, let it sink in, folks, that we're back at InfoWars, and the corporate media's got major egg on their face, and America's back, and Trump overrode the fraud, and the American people aren't your slaves.
[00:02:54.289 --> 00:03:02.150]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones, and in case they shut it down again, at AJNLive on X as well for the Alex Jones Network.
[00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.169]  God bless, and thank you all for your support.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.439]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.199]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.189]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're gonna come for us.
[00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.610]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.569]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.270]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.389]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.090]  Listen!
[00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.969]  I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:59.219]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.680]  One of the top stories in the country in the last 24 hours is Infowars sold the onion.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.639]  But now we find out it's the Democratic Party and George Soros' main gun control group.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.800]  They went on Good Morning America to brag about it this morning and...
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.480]  Stuff didn't go too well.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.399]  And the judge had an emergency hearing and said, I hadn't even authorized an auction yet.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.980]  There were major issues.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.639]  We're supposed to have hearings about this.
[00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.939]  And now you've sold it?
[00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.879]  Who was the highest bidder?
[00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.800]  This group over here that works with Alex Jones.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.500]  Well, what was the winning bid?
[00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.779]  We can't tell you.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120]  We're good to go.
[00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:19.930]  I told everybody celebrating all this stuff, I said, you know, I know the left owns a lot of the courts, but I don't think they own this particular bankruptcy judge, and I knew what his rulings were.
[00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.670]  And I know that an auction in Webster's dictionary means sold to the highest bidder.
[00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.569]  You can pull it up.
[00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.829]  Webster, Merriam-Webster definition of auction.
[00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.709]  A sale of property to the highest bidder.
[00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.949]  Goes back to Roman times, Old English.
[00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.230]  Same in China and Japan and every culture.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.060]  It's also associated with being public.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.360]  And it was ordered to be public when the judge was going to authorize it.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.160]  But it wasn't public.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.579]  And it wasn't an auction.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:06:07.920]  It was a private sale disguised as an auction to the Democratic Party gun control group using The Onion as its front group and a former disinformation specialist from MSNBC Live exclusive,
[00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.279]  Alex Jones returns to InfoWars Historic Studios after Judge blocked sale to The Onion.
[00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.879]  Massive legacy media Democrat hoax has collapsed.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.759]  Now, this news broke at 11 a.m.
[00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:31.360]  this morning, and tens of millions watched me talk about it on our radio stations, TV stations, X, everywhere, because we just have a backup studio, the Alex Jones Network, and everything was fired up and ready.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.639]  They came in here yesterday morning, told us, get out.
[00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.329]  Started turning the website off, turning the studios off.
[00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.689]  And I looked at the U.S. trustee from the Justice Department, assigned to the case.
[00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.790]  I said, you know, the last U.S. trustee got fired June 14th for trying to kick us out of the building.
[00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:50.389]  Why are you guys so desperate?
[00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.850]  Why don't you let us just go through the court process?
[00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.550]  You don't have that right.
[00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.709]  You've exceeded your authority by a million miles.
[00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:06.060]  Well, today, when they saw the filings that were about to be filed, that are still being filed, They said, fine, you can have your studio back in your website for now.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.680]  Well, you didn't give us anything.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.639]  The judge said in the hearing yesterday that there was no real auction.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.740]  He said an auction is where you can publicly bid and the highest bidder gets it.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.279]  The judge knew the Merriam-Webster's definition, we'll pull it up, of an auction.
[00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.319]  So last night I shot videos up until midnight at my house.
[00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:34.040]  And I said, everybody laughing, everybody talking about this, and the owner of The Onion said, Says we're going to make fun of Alex Jones.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.439]  We're going to make people think we're him.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.420]  We're going to put out stupid stories in his name.
[00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.259]  Really?
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.980]  Did you license my likeness?
[00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:48.199]  Has the 13th Amendment been repealed against indentured servitude and slavery?
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.459]  And they actually say on Good Morning America, they go, well, you know, Stephanopoulos was asking, well, how do you have the right to do this?
[00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:02.420]  How do you, you know, I heard that There's questioning over this by the judgment.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.259]  There's not questioning.
[00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:05.160]  He just said yesterday that it didn't go through.
[00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.019]  None of the media want to report on that, but that was what happened.
[00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.360]  And they say, well, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:16.740]  I mean, we're just allowed to do whatever we want to Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:29.600]  And if Alex Jones just would have moved away, that's a quote I'll pledge for you in a moment, well, we would have left him alone.
[00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.139]  Yeah, they told me that in mediation.
[00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.200]  We don't want money to stop being pro-Second Amendment and some other things.
[00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.940]  Oh, what are those?
[00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.080]  Of course, I just want to hear what they say.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:46.360]  And I couldn't talk about it because I was in mediation, but later they just publicly said it and publicly told my lawyers outside of mediation that my lawyer said, yeah, you can talk about it now.
[00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:49.299]  Hell, they said on national TV, we want him silenced.
[00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.080]  So, they still think they're in charge.
[00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:57.600]  Maybe they think Trump's going to fall and hit his head before he gets in in 65 days.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.299]  66 days.
[00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.049]  But I started getting calls yesterday that Elon Musk was upset.
[00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:09.490]  I later learned his lawyers were at the hearing in Houston.
[00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.529]  I said, you're not getting Alex Jones' social media.
[00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:12.409]  You don't have a right to do that.
[00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.250]  They even try it, which they've tried repeatedly.
[00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.370]  We're here.
[00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:26.049]  And I can tell you, all these former high-level prosecutors and deputy attorney generals are all over TV. We'll play some clips saying, this looks really, really bad.
[00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:27.830]  Well, it doesn't look bad.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.759]  They tried to shut us down, tried to close us in late May on the 31st on that Friday.
[00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:41.259]  Took two weeks to get a hearing from the judge.
[00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:48.200]  I just refused to leave when the U.S. trustee ordered private security to come close the building and kick us out, saying, I'm with the Justice Department.
[00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:48.779]  Really?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.179]  Okay.
[00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:56.320]  Like a cop who's not on duty putting a uniform on and going out and telling people to mow his yard.
[00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:02.879]  That's impersonating an officer when you're not on duty, and an officer can only do his constitutional duties.
[00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:05.460]  And that all happened.
[00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:09.139]  They fired that U.S. trustee, and then the judge said, well, he's in personal bankruptcy.
[00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:10.659]  You're trying to shut it down.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.419]  All you can do is have a liquidation.
[00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:17.110]  And anybody that wants to buy it, hi, it's better.
[00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:20.389]  And then they said they want to own my name, my likeness.
[00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.409]  The judge said he couldn't do that.
[00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:22.809]  They had more stuff they wanted.
[00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:23.809]  He said, you got to have hearings.
[00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:26.990]  And then yesterday, he's like, I didn't authorize this auction.
[00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:28.149]  You were supposed to come back with hearings.
[00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.210]  I told you that a month ago.
[00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:31.690]  Do you understand, Mr.
[00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:31.909]  Murray?
[00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:32.929]  You exceeded your authority.
[00:10:32.929 --> 00:10:34.110]  I did not say that in the order.
[00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.529]  And Murray goes, I don't need an order.
[00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:39.769]  And the judge blew up for Lopez, Chris Lopez.
[00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:41.190]  He blew up at him.
[00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:48.399]  Bloomberg headline, judge angrily Ask about lack of transparency in auction.
[00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:52.379]  I went on to say there wasn't an auction.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.360]  And so I go on air from my own backup network system and from my phone at my house last night.
[00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:02.200]  And I said, I've read the transcript.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.700]  I've looked at what the judge said.
[00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:04.379]  I've talked to my lawyers.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.200]  He clearly said this is not happening.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:22.720]  And the thinking is he either under the law has to order a new public properly done auction or That's not fake, got a secret sale disguise, or generally, that's the side way.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.299]  That's like a 30% chance.
[00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.919]  The law is very clear.
[00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:39.559]  The real bidder that came in with real money and did it all by the book, they're disqualified, the people that didn't do it properly, and it's given to the group that are good folks I've been working with for many years.
[00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:44.940]  So, that's where this is.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.879]  And all the lawyers in the law and separate ones, outside ones, looked at it and said, yeah, the judge is a straight shooter.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.740]  He's pretty much got to give the highest bidder that.
[00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:04.220]  Or he could just say, well, you can start bidding right here in the courthouse.
[00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.720]  They do that all the time.
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.100]  But Lopez doesn't usually do that.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:18.899]  But the real move is to say, this is disqualified, it was secret, it was wrong, but these people came and did it right, and it goes to the group that Jones has already signed a contract with to work with in the future.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.480]  That was done to discourage other good bettors so they wouldn't waste their money.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:31.320]  So, this is a scandal of scandals, and obviously I've been on the air all day at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:38.779]  I learned that they called at like 10.30, And said, yeah, he needs to come back.
[00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:40.120]  This crew needs to come back.
[00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.799]  They need to get back on air.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.399]  Because they know they're damaging this estate that's supposedly for the creditors.
[00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.919]  And that they did not have the authority to do this.
[00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:51.639]  I mean, it's a Shanghai-ing.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.379]  It's a hijacking.
[00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.419]  You can't halfway rob a bank.
[00:12:57.899 --> 00:12:59.240]  And this is my opinion.
[00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:02.899]  Like I said yesterday, it's my opinion the judge reversed this because he said it's not an auction.
[00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:05.120]  You don't have authority to do that.
[00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:06.659]  That's what that sounds like to me.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.080]  Last night I said, I think we'll be back in tomorrow or sometime this weekend or next week.
[00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:13.080]  I said, so just keep laughing.
[00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:16.899]  In fact, guys, I uploaded three videos last night in my bedroom.
[00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:18.659]  I was too tired to even put a shirt on.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.539]  It was 5 a.m.
[00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:20.100]  It was like midnight.
[00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:21.899]  Go get the first one I uploaded.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.279]  You'll see them in order.
[00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:24.179]  It's the bottom one.
[00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.259]  And I want to play those for people.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.059]  You know, with my bloodshot eyes and everything else.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.879]  That's a sign of my vigor and hard work.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.799]  You know, after putting in an 18, 19-hour day.
[00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:40.879]  Before I laid my head down to rest.
[00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:42.860]  And boy, did I sleep good last night.
[00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:44.940]  And I said, just keep laughing.
[00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:50.399]  Just you keep laughing, laughing, ha, ha, ha.
[00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:53.659]  Because even if you're able, by some...
[00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:58.450]  Weird twist of manipulation now to get InfoWars.
[00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:11.009]  I'm going to sue you till the end of the world when you try to act like you're me and misrepresent you're me when you've already said you want to hurt me and hurt who I am by putting on my skin and stealing my identity.
[00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:15.169]  And I'm going to sue the big Democrat gun control group.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.100]  I'm gonna go after them all.
[00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:19.600]  And they are screwed.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.500]  And there's already suits filed.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.240]  It's never been in the news in a month because they're so freaked out.
[00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.620]  Leave all of my civil rights, a criminal conspiracy against rights.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.399]  It's all cut and dry.
[00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:36.379]  Fake trials run by HBO, all scripted, already found guilty.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:45.940]  I mean, the greatest kangaroo trials in the history of the world, even more scripted than Trump's, where they all met secretly at the White House with the Justice Department, cooked it all up, now admit it.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.480]  And boy, Letitia James, they're all going to jail.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.840]  It's in the news today.
[00:14:52.089 --> 00:15:03.889]  So, they thought they had unlimited power, and whatever happens to me, the worms turned, we have the initiative, the Globals for a Deep Trouble, General Flynn's in the day on my Alex Jones Network show, which is InfoWars.
[00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:23.580]  And I told the crew, I said, InfoWars isn't gone, and now corrupt DOJ's actions and bankruptcy of Alex Jones will likely be investigated by the DOJ. DOJ's botched Infowars auction likely to be investigated by Trump's AG pick.
[00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:24.879]  Goes on.
[00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:26.460]  His former assistant attorney general.
[00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:28.320]  Another one.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.220]  Onion CEO stumbles when asked about highest bid from Infowars and judge halting sale.
[00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:37.840]  So, here we are.
[00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:42.879]  You're watching right now on X. You're watching on Infowars.com.
[00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:47.080]  This is internet only because we're up here on Friday night.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.740]  The network shows going out to radio and TV stations right now from the other studio.
[00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:57.720]  But we're here, and everybody's watching, and here I am.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.059]  The left probably wouldn't believe.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.139]  Go to Google.
[00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.480]  Show them the front page of Google.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.679]  Click on an article.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.100]  Show people the current time.
[00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:08.059]  All right?
[00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.080]  Because they'll say, oh, this is like some tape.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.759]  This isn't even real.
[00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:17.019]  Because, you know, the New York Times told you it was sold, and I was defeated, and it was all, and I told you this is bull.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:28.240]  And I said on Monday, when they went from a regular public auction, with a big auction company, and they said, oh, now that's all forgotten.
[00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:29.460]  Now it's just one bid.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.600]  Whoever's the biggest gets it, but we have the right to give it to somebody for less.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.850]  And then when they, we now learned that their so-called bid Wasn't even money.
[00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:54.490]  It was promising a fraction of the $1.5 billion, like that's real money, like I ever had $10 million, and like I ever, you know, oh, so I guess they're going to go out and all take loans out of their $1.5 billion, and we're all going to start buying, you know,
[00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.429]  private jets and castles in Switzerland with it.
[00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.670]  Maybe that's why they wanted $2.76 trillion.
[00:17:04.769 --> 00:17:06.109]  They asked me, yeah, we want $2.67 trillion.
[00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:07.390]  I was like, why would they do that?
[00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:13.250]  I haven't made, you know, maybe not $50 million I've kept my whole career, 30 years.
[00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.829]  Why would they?
[00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.730]  That all came out in the real audits.
[00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.630]  Glenn Beck talked about it today.
[00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.950]  That's all public going to the record.
[00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:20.150]  Bankruptcy is all public.
[00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.329]  Just like I told everybody.
[00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.990]  But I get it.
[00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.670]  It's like a new currency.
[00:17:26.009 --> 00:17:27.730]  Kind of like derivatives or something.
[00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:29.450]  Like, oh, Alex is worth $2.7 trillion.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:37.099]  $6 trillion, and we now have all that, and so we get to go get loans on the $2.67 trillion.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:39.940]  Interesting.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:48.500]  So it gives a new meaning to fiat fraudulent currency.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.359]  I'll play the Glenn Beck segment.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.480]  He really nailed it today.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.839]  That's coming up.
[00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:54.759]  But let's get started here.
[00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:09.829]  Let's play what one of the former assistant attorney generals, very respected, Jeffrey Clark, had to say.
[00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.809]  And he was going off what was in the news because Roger Stone did get a big group with a bunch of money.
[00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.529]  And I told him two weeks ago, I said, listen, it's all rigged.
[00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:19.630]  I can guarantee you they're not going to take it.
[00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.849]  I already know what's going on.
[00:18:22.529 --> 00:18:24.349]  And I said, I've got a group I've worked for forever.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:31.440]  If I'm wrong and they actually let our highest bid get it, then just come in and work with us.
[00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.660]  We'll expand the network and hire a bunch of people and really kick ass.
[00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:35.079]  They said, really?
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.339]  Okay.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.880]  So Roger and them did do that.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.680]  It wasn't made up.
[00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:44.559]  And then Roger called me mad at other people when they saw this and thought, well, how'd you predict it exactly?
[00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.740]  Were you working with them?
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.920]  I was like, of course not.
[00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.599]  And then they saw the news and said, oh, gosh.
[00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:50.440]  I just knew.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.339]  I mean, that's all that's happened to me in this case.
[00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:56.930]  The last trustee tried to throw us out of the building without a court order and he got fired.
[00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.769]  And tried to set me up in a bunch of stuff.
[00:18:59.769 --> 00:19:00.329]  We caught him.
[00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.109]  So this has been crazy.
[00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:10.849]  And then Chris Murray, the new trustee, he even said in the newspapers yesterday before he figured out how much trouble he was in before the hearing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.470]  Oh yeah, there was a bigger bid.
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.650]  But I wanted the families to have it.
[00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:19.430]  So we met with them and figured out a way for them to get it.
[00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:28.940]  So they could bid A couple hundred thousand dollars more than the real bid, but in fiat imaginary money.
[00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:38.799]  So, bid rigging, bid collusion, a felony, and he's in the news talking about it, which makes me think maybe he didn't know.
[00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:42.359]  Maybe it's just negligence.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.859]  But I mean, I wouldn't check with lawyers.
[00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:50.019]  The people I was working with would not tell me what they were betting, would not even talk to me.
[00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:51.759]  They just said, well, you have an employment contract.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.460]  If we get it and your employment contract says you have total free speech and all that, I said, yeah.
[00:19:56.319 --> 00:20:00.039]  And we gave that to Murray and he knew all about that a month ago.
[00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:01.960]  Total disclosure.
[00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:07.200]  Because the main lawyer for this company is a very successful, well-known bankruptcy lawyer.
[00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:10.500]  So they made sure we did it 100% properly.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.799]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.079]  And it's a felon on its face.
[00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.309]  That's my view.
[00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.269]  That's my opinion.
[00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.250]  But it was my opinion yesterday that we'd be back in here by tomorrow or Monday.
[00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.529]  The judges are on Friday and Mondays.
[00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.170]  It wouldn't be this weekend.
[00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:35.490]  We played the videos.
[00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.490]  We did three of them out last night.
[00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:37.869]  I think I said two of them.
[00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.430]  You watch.
[00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.089]  We'll be back in.
[00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.569]  If the judge isn't corrupt, word for word.
[00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.589]  And he hadn't been corrupt so far.
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.609]  He just follows the law.
[00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.730]  Does not do us any favors, though.
[00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.910]  I mean, zero.
[00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.670]  He follows the law that kind of goes a little, not off the law, but right over to them.
[00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.890]  He said that to him before.
[00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:00.190]  He said, look, I'd love to help you out here.
[00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.829]  Sorry, you guys are wrong.
[00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.970]  So, that just happened again.
[00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.069]  And, you know, God forbid...
[00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:12.930]  Oh, it's just crazy.
[00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.769]  So I'm not here predicting we won't be thrown out of here in a month, two months, three months, whatever, next week.
[00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.569]  And the left's so crazy and out of their minds.
[00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.650]  You know, who knows what they'll do?
[00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:23.170]  I mean, who knows?
[00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:24.329]  I don't want to give them ideas.
[00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:26.569]  You can imagine, though, you're pretty smart, viewers.
[00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:35.009]  So they see me as this symbol, which we are to the good guys and the bad guys, as the patriot.
[00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:39.490]  And they hate me second only to Trump.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.859]  I mean, they really hate me, and they haven't got us off the air yet, so it pisses them off more and more.
[00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.839]  And at this point, this is an adventure.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.359]  I mean, I don't like it, but I kind of do.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.259]  I mean, this is getting wild.
[00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:58.140]  I mean, this is the battle for the Republic, fifth generational warfare, information war.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.079]  We've got the truth.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.779]  They've got lies.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.380]  We keep winning because they're like a cartoon character supervillain.
[00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:09.059]  And then they went on a bunch of shows, but I'm not going to play them all.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.400]  I mean, there's more than I can even watch.
[00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:19.640]  A victory tour on national TV. And they say, you know, Stephanopoulos slanders me, defames me.
[00:22:20.019 --> 00:22:22.559]  The old lie that's been debunked that I had all this money that I'm hiding.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.299]  And I got it from these people and just all that.
[00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:29.579]  And they say, but it's Alex Jones we're allowed to.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.759]  And then he says, did you have the high spit?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.000]  Oh, yeah, I had the high spit.
[00:22:32.099 --> 00:22:32.599]  No, you didn't.
[00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.869]  And, well, the judge is challenging it.
[00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:35.410]  Oh, it's mine.
[00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:36.109]  I've got it.
[00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:39.890]  That was this morning on Good Morning America.
[00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.230]  Where are we now?
[00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:44.109]  We're back on air.
[00:22:48.809 --> 00:22:58.660]  And we can either leave this up to the judge or To decide different things on how this was run.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.539]  Or we have the rights just to go ahead and shut this all down and sue everybody.
[00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:07.960]  And I can tell you the decisions have already been made, not even by me, not by my lawyers.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.279]  You're all getting sued.
[00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:13.660]  So it's not just by the people trying to buy it.
[00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:15.420]  Other people are suing you.
[00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:16.579]  It's done.
[00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:18.140]  You'll get served by Monday.
[00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:22.059]  So all of you get ready and enjoy yourselves.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.480]  I mean, if they even ran up the white flag and just let our bidders get it fair and square, sorry.
[00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:32.700]  This is about justice.
[00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:36.819]  So, that's where this is.
[00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:39.279]  That's where this is going.
[00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:50.039]  And the Justice Department guys, others have said, if they go ahead and just shut us down and do the mafia thing, they're getting indicted for sure by the new Trump administration.
[00:23:52.769 --> 00:24:02.450]  So, because let me tell you, this has now been chosen to display what Trump's talking about with the government media court collusion.
[00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.950]  You think Trump isn't pissed off?
[00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:07.009]  You think he doesn't take it personal?
[00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.670]  He knows I'm one of his biggest offenders.
[00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:18.970]  It'd be like if I have a dog, my German shepherd that protects my family, and it's chewed up 10 or 15 people that tried to attack us, and now I see somebody beating my dog with a baseball bat, you think I get pissed off?
[00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.589]  And yeah, I compare myself to Trump's dog.
[00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:25.640]  The point is, is that Trump's defending America, so I'm defending Trump.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.220]  And I am an attack dog, and I tell the truth.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.400]  And so, you're messing with me, you're messing with everybody now.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.200]  We're done.
[00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:37.980]  I told you, if you want to fight, you got one.
[00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:41.279]  And if you want to have a fight, you came to the right place.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.799]  I'm not looking for one, but my God, if you start one, I just can't help myself.
[00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:46.980]  I actually like it.
[00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:50.559]  So, you want to come in my wheelhouse?
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.680]  Go ahead.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.440]  Come on in.
[00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:53.200]  The water's warm.
[00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:56.259]  And you're in the water now.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.720]  And I don't smell blood politically.
[00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.480]  I'm like a great white shark in an Olympic-sized pool filled with blood.
[00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:17.430]  So, you guys have committed, not just this case, all the globalists, the human trafficking of kids, the World War III, the pedophilia, the New World Order garbage, the GMO, the poison shots, all of it.
[00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:18.650]  We're done!
[00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.849]  We're done!
[00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:40.240]  I told you thousands of times, you thought we were pussies because America was asleep while you were bullying people and you didn't understand we were asleep Or we were a minority of folks that were awake.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.140]  And we didn't have our own systems of media.
[00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:47.180]  We're awake, we got our own media, and we're pissed.
[00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:52.839]  We don't just have the initiative, we are devastating you.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.940]  And nothing you can pull, no false flags, nothing will change that.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.259]  If the general public slips on a banana peel, they're going to blame you.
[00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.230]  But you know, it is always you.
[00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:09.410]  Remember we told you they're not giving Trump supporters aid.
[00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.329]  They're not going to Republican counties.
[00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.769]  You can look at the maps in North Carolina.
[00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.089]  And then we got all the documents.
[00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:15.490]  And it wasn't one lady.
[00:26:15.609 --> 00:26:16.250]  It was the agency.
[00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:22.490]  And then we got videos of the agency heads in their own Zoom meetings saying, don't give Christians, whites, or conservatives any help.
[00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.250]  We used to be egalitarian, help everybody.
[00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:27.789]  Now we only help LGBTQ whatever.
[00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.210]  You've seen the video.
[00:26:31.309 --> 00:26:31.750]  You want to see it?
[00:26:31.829 --> 00:26:32.950]  I mean, that's discrimination.
[00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:35.980]  We know you don't like us.
[00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:37.259]  We know you're out to get us.
[00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:38.500]  We know you're attacking us.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.660]  And so we're done playing games.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.339]  And we realize when we're nice to you, it just makes you abuse us more.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.079]  Like we're some prostitute and you're the pimp.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.880]  And you break our arm or put cigarettes out on us and we thank you.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.759]  No, we don't thank you.
[00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:54.019]  We're done.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.140]  We're getting off the plantation.
[00:26:57.599 --> 00:26:58.599]  Figure it out yet?
[00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:00.460]  It's a global realignment.
[00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:02.519]  And I'm just honored to be a part of it.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.759]  Now, let's start getting to the clips, because I want to get the crew in here and break all this down, and then we're just going to re-loop this live transmission that started at 5 p.m.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.599]  Central until Sunday night, and I'll be back here live, and the media's going to have a big problem.
[00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:18.380]  Alex Jones is back in his studios.
[00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.420]  Alex Jones is on the air right now.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.359]  But The Onion bought it.
[00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:30.059]  You're about to see him brag about it, like he's a Sylvester caught with Tweety Bird in his mouth.
[00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:37.880]  But what they're really politically going to look like is Wiley Coyote springing one of his traps on the Roadrunner.
[00:27:38.019 --> 00:27:40.019]  And you know how that ends.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.779]  See, we're the Roadrunner.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.579]  You're the Coyote.
[00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.759]  You're Sylvester.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:50.720]  We're Tweety.
[00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:53.140]  We're Bugs Bunny.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.059]  You're Yosemite Sam.
[00:27:55.279 --> 00:28:00.019]  And you might say you're the roughest, toughest hombre west of the Pecos.
[00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.250]  I'm Yosemite Sam!
[00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.769]  Yosemite Sam!
[00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:05.589]  Yosemite Sam!
[00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:08.390]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:14.210]  It's not like Yosemite Sam, he's beating that elephant in that great episode.
[00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:15.390]  He's going, how am you, huh?
[00:28:15.809 --> 00:28:21.829]  And pretty much, then the elephant turns around with his shield and starts bashing Yosemite Sam on the head.
[00:28:21.849 --> 00:28:24.309]  He goes, I'm with the good guys now!
[00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:35.220]  Like when the American people figure out what they're doing, that we're a 10-ton elephant and you're a cockroach, that's not going to go too well for you, is it?
[00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:38.380]  Who is that?
[00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:45.119]  Jeffrey Clark.
[00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:47.000]  All right, let's go to our clip.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:56.220]  Here is the bankruptcy arm of the DOJ was involved in the Alex Jones bankruptcy and the Trump team will likely look into it.
[00:28:57.099 --> 00:29:01.819]  Corrupt actions of bankruptcy being called for investigations and I'm told they're already starting.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.440]  People actually in there currently.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.660]  This is a big deal.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.460]  Let's go ahead and let's roll that tape.
[00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:22.519]  actually, as one of my closing acts at the end of the Trump administration, argue a case about the U.S. bankruptcy trustees, who are the same folks here who are bedeviling Alex Jones and went in and shut him down.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:45.720]  And look, as you were describing, they have, in connection with the private trustees that are set up and that they supervise, We're good to go.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.259]  We're good to go.
[00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:53.480]  You know, that's a serious legal issue that will need to be examined.
[00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:57.480]  I was looking at who the current director is of the U.S. trustee program.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.259]  It's a woman named Tara Twomey.
[00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:13.660]  And you better believe that when the Trump administration starts, That she's going to get investigated, that how this bankruptcy of Alex Jones was investigated, how it was dealt with, is going to be investigated.
[00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:18.440]  This is something that hopefully the judge will shut this down and say, look, I got to review this.
[00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:20.079]  Don't do anything precipitous.
[00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:28.099]  But if he doesn't, because he's been working on these proceedings for a long time and judges eventually get to the point where they want to get things off their docket.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.019]  What the trustees seem to be doing here to me, and these are people who are part of the Justice Department.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.220]  I don't think that's well known, that the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Program is part of the Justice Department.
[00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:44.039]  The Justice Department's span is truly enormous.
[00:30:44.629 --> 00:30:46.329]  You know, that needs to be investigated.
[00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:53.230]  And I think that we can probably count on Matt Gaetz as Attorney General to do that kind of deep investigation, Steve.
[00:30:53.450 --> 00:31:02.390]  And so they're trying to clearly rush this out and shut Alex Jones down as a kind of demonstration of they're still in charge for the next 67 days or so.
[00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:05.009]  And, you know, they could live to regret that.
[00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:12.349]  And so I think people should be looking over their shoulder and thinking about whether they really want to be doing this to shut down an important media operation.
[00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:16.000]  Oh, overhead shots, please.
[00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:17.519]  Look at this headline.
[00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:19.099]  I think Revolver got the best headline.
[00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:24.180]  Infowars restored to Alex Jones in total reversal of yesterday's shutdown.
[00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:29.200]  Alexander Soros also just came out and said he likes Trump.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.700]  Oh, I told you they're rolling over.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.000]  I'll show you that in a minute.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.299]  DOJ botched Infowars auction likely to be investigated by Trump.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.960]  A.G. Pick Matt Gaetz is former A.G. Assistant Attorney General.
[00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:42.720]  Alright, let's go to the next clip.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.940]  And this is incredible.
[00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:45.599]  I'm going to start and stop this one.
[00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:47.819]  Because this is big.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.799]  I mean, there's so many lies.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.079]  I'm sure you'll catch it.
[00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.380]  They really fall on their face here.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:32:08.579]  But now we learn, as I told you, the Democrats' big anti-gun group, mainly funded by Soros, Soros Money, he was going to use Media Matters he funds, but he used them to go in and put in this fake bid Because it wasn't a bid.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.660]  They'd already decided they got it.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.140]  They just inadvertently admitted that.
[00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.160]  The U.S. trustee, well, I wanted to give it to them.
[00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:14.900]  It's my discretion.
[00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:15.660]  The judge says, no, it's not.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:28.960]  And then they used judgment money that you can't do in law, that's on appeal, to claim that's money to themselves for the purchase.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.779]  I mean, that's like what somebody on three hits of acid would come up with at math class.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:52.940]  So, here it is, with the big gun control group, the biggest, and the former disinformation expert from MSNBC, just absolutely looking like morons.
[00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:53.460]  Here it is.
[00:32:54.019 --> 00:33:00.660]  Turn now to the satirical website The Onion announcing that it has won a bid to buy Alex Jones' Infowars in a bankruptcy auction.
[00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:05.329]  Jones was forced to pay $1.4 billion to the families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims.
[00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.569]  Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion, is teamed up with John Fineblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, on this project.
[00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.309]  Welcome to you both.
[00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.509]  Thank you for coming in this morning.
[00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:17.150]  I had to say, Ben, when I saw this headline yesterday, I was pretty startled at first.
[00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:20.470]  Explain why you wanted to buy this site, what you plan to do with it.
[00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:24.740]  Yeah, so we thought it would be the funniest joke of all time, basically, when we heard about it.
[00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:26.420]  And I think that's borne out, frankly.
[00:33:27.259 --> 00:33:27.839]  Explain why.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.920]  Explain to everybody what's behind the Infowars and what you want to do with it.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.099]  Sure.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.279]  So Infowars is a clearinghouse for lies and nonsense in a bad way.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.039]  Like, the garbage that they've put out over the last two decades has really hurt a lot of people.
[00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:44.740]  You know, they've targeted the families of the Sandy Hook victims.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.019]  That's what led to that definition.
[00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:48.579]  Back it up.
[00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:56.559]  No, I was found guilty by judges in show trials, and no evidence was put on, and I wasn't allowed to defend myself, and I did nothing to those people.
[00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.700]  I wasn't deplatformed over that.
[00:33:58.859 --> 00:34:06.460]  They just brought it all up at PR firms, talk about stuff I never did, exaggerate everything, then find me guilty, and then they said to shut me down, they didn't want money.
[00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:07.559]  So, let's continue.
[00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:14.380]  Explain why, explain to everybody what's behind the InfoWars and what you want to do with it.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.699]  Sure, so InfoWars is a clearinghouse for lies and nonsense in a bad way.
[00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:23.480]  Like the garbage that they've put out over the last two decades has really hurt a lot of people.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.900]  You know, they've targeted the families of the Sandy Hook victims.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.239]  Did not.
[00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:32.380]  That's what led to the defamation case that allowed this to be up for auction.
[00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.130]  We do lies and garbage in a different way.
[00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:36.630]  We have a lot more fun with it than they do.
[00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:42.130]  We're very excited to take it over and, you know, create a new, better path for this website.
[00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:44.010]  And the Sandy Hook family support this move?
[00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:44.710]  Absolutely.
[00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:45.849]  They were behind this.
[00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:50.289]  And, you know, Ben and I may seem like strange bedfellows, The Onion.
[00:34:51.029 --> 00:34:52.289]  And every town.
[00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:57.750]  But the truth is, we've got at our fingertips the facts, the stories, the data, the research.
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:03.949]  But what they've got is a really broad audience and humor, which is what you need sometimes to break through.
[00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.590]  The Onion is basically bankrupt.
[00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.090]  No one looks at it.
[00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.590]  It's been sold three times last year.
[00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.789]  It's a total, complete joke.
[00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:12.909]  So all that was pure horse crap as well.
[00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.309]  Let's continue.
[00:35:14.539 --> 00:35:18.360]  Information, the fear that is so permeated mainstream thinking.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:26.860]  Overnight, the judge in charge of this put a hold on your purchase, raising questions about the process, raising questions about transparency in the bidding process.
[00:35:27.099 --> 00:35:27.940]  What do you make of that?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.480]  Are you confident this is still going to go through?
[00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:30.719]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:35.880]  Uh, yeah, we won the bid.
[00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:37.760]  You won the bid?
[00:35:38.099 --> 00:35:44.039]  The trustee's been in the news saying, well, I decided to give it to them, and, you know, they needed extra money, so we came up with this plan.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.300]  And then they didn't tell the real bidders that, and the rules, you can't do that.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.519]  And then they changed the stuff last minute.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.039]  And the judge said that wasn't a real auction.
[00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:54.260]  That's why we're back in the building.
[00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.690]  So here he is this morning saying, we own InfoWars, we won the bid.
[00:35:58.869 --> 00:35:59.610]  None of that's true.
[00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:00.289]  Here it is.
[00:36:00.469 --> 00:36:03.730]  The fear that is so permeated mainstream thinking.
[00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:12.269]  Overnight, the judge in charge of this put a hold on your purchase, raising questions about the process, raising questions about transparency in the bidding process.
[00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.309]  What do you make of that?
[00:36:13.369 --> 00:36:14.849]  Are you confident this is still going to go through?
[00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.090]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[00:36:16.489 --> 00:36:19.630]  We own InfoWars and we are very excited about that.
[00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:20.889]  But is it true that you didn't have the highest bid?
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.900]  We did have the highest bid when you take into account the family's concessions here.
[00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:32.719]  They made a concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.599]  So we're very excited to take that over.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.900]  Back that up, 20 seconds.
[00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.329]  You love the looking down.
[00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:40.210]  He's looking up the whole time.
[00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:42.869]  I won the bid and they made it possible.
[00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:51.030]  They made it possible by saying judgment money that's on appeal that I don't have can be in a cash auction.
[00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.170]  The law says you can't do that.
[00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:54.110]  And it wasn't even...
[00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.949]  The judge didn't even know this auction happened, which wasn't an auction.
[00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.190]  I mean, it's bullshit on top of bullshit on top of bullshit.
[00:37:01.389 --> 00:37:03.630]  I mean, wow, buddy boy.
[00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:04.750]  Go back to it.
[00:37:05.629 --> 00:37:13.650]  Overnight, the judge in charge of this put a hold on your purchase, raising questions about the process, raising questions about transparency in the bidding process.
[00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:14.710]  What do you make of that?
[00:37:14.769 --> 00:37:16.250]  Are you confident this is still going to go through?
[00:37:16.469 --> 00:37:17.489]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[00:37:18.449 --> 00:37:21.030]  We own Inforas, and we are very excited about that.
[00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.289]  But is it true that you didn't have the highest bid?
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.300]  We did have the highest bid when you take into account the family's concessions here.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.119]  They made a concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[00:37:34.699 --> 00:37:37.000]  So we're very excited to take that over.
[00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:38.920]  Look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:44.940]  If he just handled this graciously and moved away, that would be the funniest part of this whole situation.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.079]  Back it up.
[00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:50.920]  If he just went away, if I handled it graciously...
[00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:57.969]  They claim I had hundreds of millions of dollars made off them, claim I did all these things I did to them I never did, had show trials where I was already found guilty before they started.
[00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.309]  The judges said, look it up, folks.
[00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:16.769]  And the head prosecutor, who was the civil guy running this, Democrat, especially putting innocent Republicans in prison, is my view, said on Nightly News last night, he said, we've just begun to teach Alex Jones his lessons.
[00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.110]  He won't give us our money.
[00:38:20.409 --> 00:38:22.650]  We don't want money, but he won't give us our money.
[00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:35.369]  So, you know, if Alex Jones would have just been gracious about this, you know, oh, you mean become anti-gun and become a liberal and work for you and sell out?
[00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:43.630]  Brother, you could put a gun to my head and say you're going to blow my brains out and I would tell you burn in hell.
[00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.130]  How about that?
[00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:49.780]  So, these people are just in fantasy land.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.420]  Continue.
[00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:55.360]  A concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.239]  So, we're very excited to take that over.
[00:38:58.559 --> 00:38:59.300]  And pause again.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.739]  Back it up.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.260]  First, is it the highest bid?
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.159]  Well, it's the best bid.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:14.780]  And the U.S. trustee, who's in big trouble, kept saying in the news, well, it's not the highest bid, but it's the best bid.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:31.760]  That's the new definition of Merriam-Webster's auction is property, property sold to the highest bidder.
[00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:34.639]  That's the definition.
[00:39:36.789 --> 00:39:41.190]  By the way, before they said that was some secret code with a gun, the guys were just throwing up funny stuff, like the Revenge of the Nerds thing.
[00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.449]  Great move by the crew.
[00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.010]  Very funny.
[00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:44.130]  Didn't tell them to put that up.
[00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.150]  And the gun thing is, I'm saying, I'm not going to hurt you.
[00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.889]  You're not going to literally hurt me.
[00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.829]  I'm saying, figuratively, you put a gun in my head, I would not sell out to you.
[00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:50.409]  That's what I was saying.
[00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:51.110]  All right.
[00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.050]  They just misrepresent everything.
[00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:53.409]  All right.
[00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.730]  So, continuing here.
[00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.090]  These people do not know what to do.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.639]  And they're in total panic mode.
[00:40:01.179 --> 00:40:05.619]  And they call up this morning and say, okay, yeah, you can move back in.
[00:40:05.739 --> 00:40:05.860]  Yeah.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.860]  Okay.
[00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:07.260]  Yeah.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.719]  Judge said that we didn't have an auction.
[00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:13.500]  Now, we're here.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.539]  Now, are you seeing that in the news?
[00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:18.139]  That's pretty big news, right?
[00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:21.159]  So how controlled is the corporate media?
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.280]  Why are they so hated?
[00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:27.309]  The same ones that tell you the shots 100% work and you can't spread COVID if you take it.
[00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.550]  And they knew that wasn't true.
[00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.389]  They were paid to say it.
[00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:30.349]  Rachel Manow.
[00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.309]  Other ones.
[00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.110]  They're the ones really hurting the public and they're the ones under criminal investigation once RFK Jr.
[00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:37.909]  is the head of HHS and Trump has said that.
[00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:42.570]  And the Justice Department is coming after you because you killed a lot of people with those poison shots.
[00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.329]  You liars.
[00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:46.730]  So you want to make us the villains?
[00:40:46.889 --> 00:40:48.190]  You are the villains.
[00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.190]  And no amount of your propaganda is going to work.
[00:40:51.269 --> 00:40:51.730]  Finish the clip.
[00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.219]  Yeah, look, we won the bid.
[00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:57.800]  We are very excited about that.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.019]  But is it true that you didn't have the highest bid?
[00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:05.039]  We did have the highest bid when you take into account the family's concessions here.
[00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:10.840]  They made a concerted effort to make this the best and highest bid for everybody involved.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.739]  So we're very excited to take that over.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.659]  And look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:21.630]  If he just handled this graciously and moved away, that would be the funniest part of this whole situation.
[00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.590]  Obviously, that is not something that he's going to do in this situation.
[00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.150]  So you're confident this is going to go through?
[00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:26.590]  Absolutely.
[00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:29.349]  And what role is Everytown for Gun Safety going to play in all this?
[00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:30.670]  We're going to be the main advertisers.
[00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:37.750]  And that means anything from a banner ad to a link to video to creating content together.
[00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.989]  And the goal here is really To cut through the misinformation and the fear.
[00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.210]  You know, the American public, every poll shows that they believe in gun safety.
[00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:56.869]  But what's happened is misinformation, hate, fear has so permeated thinking in this country that it's really distorted reality.
[00:41:56.869 --> 00:42:01.050]  And we're going to use humor to cut through that and to set the record straight.
[00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.889]  That's the best way to stop, Alex Jones.
[00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.829]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:05.309]  I used to be a disinformation reporter.
[00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:07.070]  I used to cover him from the other side of this.
[00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:11.150]  You can present as many facts as you want to Alex Jones himself and he's just not going to listen.
[00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:26.710]  But if you make fun of these people in a way that cuts through and if you maybe show a funhouse mirror basically to what he's trying to do, trying to get you really afraid so you can buy some supplements, maybe if we rip the facade off this thing, show the wires underneath it, maybe we can make some real changes.
[00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:28.409]  He's spread his funds out all over the place.
[00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.369]  Is there any real way to stop him?
[00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:32.369]  You can try.
[00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:34.849]  It's not worth it giving up, in my opinion.
[00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:36.969]  I think that's what the reaction was yesterday.
[00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.449]  You didn't believe it when you saw your phone.
[00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:40.409]  But maybe you felt like, oh, man, that's pretty funny.
[00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.769]  There's some hope in this.
[00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.150]  It's felt pretty hopeless in the last couple of months recently for a lot of people.
[00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.809]  And we wanted to say, like, actually, good things can happen.
[00:42:50.489 --> 00:42:53.170]  You know, there can be a good fight to win.
[00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:54.489]  And that's why we wanted to be here.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.179]  Yeah, the bottom line for this is, when you think about Alex Jones, this is karmic justice.
[00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:04.599]  The idea that every town would be taking over all the advertising of InfoWars.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.760]  After all that disinformation.
[00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:09.179]  After all that disinformation, after calling Sandy Hook a hoax.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.119]  Thank you both for coming in today.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:11.679]  Thanks.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.099]  Whit?
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.800]  Fascinating conversation, George.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.380]  Thank you.
[00:43:15.579 --> 00:43:20.260]  Wow, Alex Jones had an opinion that the internet had and said, yeah, that's probably true.
[00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:21.719]  You have a right to say that.
[00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:24.679]  And I only said the name of one of the parents.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.659]  I barely ever talked about it.
[00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:31.059]  And then they had an FBI agent, was that lead counsel that created the whole thing that I was coming after him years later.
[00:43:31.579 --> 00:43:33.940]  He got $133 million that doesn't exist.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.760]  Maybe he can go get a loan on that.
[00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:37.860]  Buy himself a yacht or something.
[00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:45.150]  I mean, it's wild.
[00:43:45.429 --> 00:43:49.469]  And you notice he said, you can show him facts all day, he won't believe you.
[00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.929]  Like, oh, there's no inflation, or two men can have a baby, or there's no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:43:55.389 --> 00:43:59.750]  Or Biden's sharpest attack, or Kamala's incredible, and she's going to win in a landslide.
[00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:07.489]  I mean, yeah, you can show me your facts all day, that communism's great, and us giving up our guns while the liberals and politicians have armed guards, that's okay.
[00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.550]  Yeah, you know, I'll stick with my facts.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.559]  Like I said last night, you watch, I'll be back in there soon.
[00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:21.300]  Now, and I said last night, you watch, this has been overturned.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.539]  The media just wouldn't report it.
[00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:23.880]  Now today they're admitting it is.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.719]  So here's my opinion last night, which was already true.
[00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:31.199]  And then here's what's happening today.
[00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:36.820]  I'm going to bring Harrison Smith in here and I'm going to bring Chase Geiser for what they've seen and what they've thought with all this happening.
[00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:45.449]  But the first time they sent a U.S. trustee to close the doors without a court order, we stood up to them, they left, people didn't believe us, and they admitted it in court later, people were blown away.
[00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:59.110]  And now you just saw them admit it all, and they actually did take it over and shut it down by just already being in control of IT at the internet service provider level to shut us off.
[00:44:59.429 --> 00:45:03.110]  So I was already shut off, and I just said, okay, you're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:04.730]  Bye-bye.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:13.019]  And I went over yesterday at 11 a.m., 20 minutes after I left here, went on air and exposed it all, and you watched yesterday's show, all came true.
[00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:13.900]  It was already true.
[00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:16.099]  Am I infallible?
[00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:16.579]  Am I perfect?
[00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:17.960]  No, but I really do my research.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.320]  I really try to be accurate.
[00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:23.920]  And they want to control the narrative and have us just convince us that two men can have a baby and all this.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.460]  It's over.
[00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:26.699]  Let's play these clips from last night.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.679]  I shot one, and people didn't understand what I was saying.
[00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:29.320]  I shot three.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.460]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.960]  Millions of views on all these, by the way.
[00:45:34.239 --> 00:45:35.500]  See, we're getting the truce kit now.
[00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:36.139]  We're the media.
[00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:46.780]  It's like in that Tom Hanks movie with the meme of the pirates in Somalia.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.840]  And he goes, look at me.
[00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:49.239]  I'm the captain now.
[00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:50.380]  Look at me.
[00:45:50.519 --> 00:45:51.420]  Trump's the captain now.
[00:45:52.289 --> 00:45:54.829]  So here's these clips, and I'll come back with even bigger news.
[00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:56.250]  Believe me, we haven't got there yet.
[00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:56.929]  It's hardcore.
[00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:59.429]  It's important, and it goes right to the heart of the deep state.
[00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:00.849]  They can get me, they can get you.
[00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.090]  Please support us at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.969]  Great t-shirts, great.
[00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:05.739]  Supplement's incredible.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.039]  You're fighting the second American Revolution.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:12.000]  There's another big free truck giveaway on there by the Inners for free can get put in to win.
[00:46:12.139 --> 00:46:13.820]  And by the best product, it's put in 10X to win.
[00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:15.099]  So much cool stuff.
[00:46:15.099 --> 00:46:16.079]  And we still need funds.
[00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:18.119]  I've filed lawsuits on all these people already.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.500]  We're on the offense.
[00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:29.059]  And that's just, you know, we already have the proof through court for the criminal charges of conspiracy against rights, serious felonies.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.559]  But let's go ahead and roll these and we'll bring in Harrison Smith.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.480]  All right, I shot a special report on this that I posted at Red Lock Showns about two hours ago.
[00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:46.519]  And then I was actually reading the transcripts from the multi-hour emergency court hearing today in federal bankruptcy court in Houston.
[00:46:47.099 --> 00:46:51.780]  And then I called all the lawyers and talked to them, and they had a total consensus.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.340]  They've never seen anything like it.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:05.210]  The words were exactly, this was a private secret sale, basically illegal is the word that's used, and basically it's Crime.
[00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.130]  I mean, bankruptcy crime.
[00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.269]  I mean, on its face.
[00:47:12.469 --> 00:47:14.650]  Disguised as an auction that wasn't an auction.
[00:47:17.929 --> 00:47:20.869]  And the people didn't even pay real money.
[00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:25.449]  They paid some weird fiat thing that wasn't even agreed to by the judge's order.
[00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.030]  And then they had the corporate media say that The Onion bought Infowars.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.280]  And then the judge kept saying to the trustee that did this, I didn't give you the authority to do this.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.760]  You were supposed to come to me about an auction.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.739]  This isn't even an auction.
[00:47:40.739 --> 00:47:45.880]  And then it's just all over the news that they just bought it and they won the bid and they did that.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:50.199]  But then they quote the US trustee going, well, it's not the highest bid, but it's the best bid.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.800]  These people just, they didn't do anything.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.019]  It's crazy.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:08.119]  So, nobody sees how the federal judge, who's known for being straight-laced and not corrupt at all, Judge Chris Lopez, cannot end this fake sale, which he basically said didn't happen.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:12.139]  He should have an emergency evidentiary hearing sometime next week.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.119]  He hasn't announced the date yet.
[00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:17.119]  And bare minimum, there'll be a new open public auction.
[00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:20.539]  Probably more is going to happen.
[00:48:20.699 --> 00:48:23.380]  I mean, this is unprecedented, folks.
[00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:29.099]  Just like the last trustee he fired back on June 14th, tried to close the building without a court order.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.280]  There's a lot of behind-the-scenes deep state goings on here, and this is a big deal.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.000]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:36.440]  dealing with this.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.219]  I'm about to go to sleep.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:43.460]  I'll be covering it all live from the new studios at the Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on Axe.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.139]  Please follow me there.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.280]  But this is going to be big.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.199]  Everybody out there thinking InfoWars were shut down.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.519]  You're in for a rude awakening.
[00:48:51.059 --> 00:49:00.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, You were told by the mainstream media and by the press, by the Democrats today, that InfoWars was sold in an auction yesterday.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.019]  That did not happen.
[00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:09.199]  It was an emergency hearing in front of the bankruptcy judge, Chris Lopez today, and he said, this is not an auction.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.739]  You didn't allow higher bidders.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.920]  The definition of an auction is sold to the highest bidder.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:21.260]  You kept secret the fact that you gave it to someone that paid way less money.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.960]  Turns out it wasn't even real money.
[00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:25.360]  It was a promise to pay money.
[00:49:25.579 --> 00:49:27.019]  The judge didn't certify it.
[00:49:27.059 --> 00:49:29.280]  He said, I haven't even agreed to when the auction is.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.340]  He said, we have to have hearings about the details of it and what's actually being sold.
[00:49:33.539 --> 00:49:37.300]  So they thought they would slip this through with a US trustee from the Justice Department.
[00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:42.880]  And they had the sale yesterday, said they wouldn't tell us till this morning, showed up to shut the building.
[00:49:43.869 --> 00:49:49.170]  Cut off the studio electricity while we were on air.
[00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:59.690]  Then I went to our backup studios, the Alex Jones Network, find out more at AJN Live on X. And they did announce that they bought it.
[00:49:59.769 --> 00:50:00.869]  They did announce they have it.
[00:50:00.989 --> 00:50:02.710]  But the judge said this was not an auction.
[00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:04.050]  That's a quote in the transcript.
[00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:11.369]  And he was just flabbergasted and totally blown away and said that he's going to investigate with this big hearing coming up next week.
[00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.090]  So this is total lawfare.
[00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:14.030]  It's craziness.
[00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.690]  It's been open season on me the whole time.
[00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:18.789]  The last trustee from the Justice Department, he fired June 14th.
[00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.230]  Look it up.
[00:50:19.489 --> 00:50:22.610]  Pat McGill, who tried to come in and close the place without a court order.
[00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:24.070]  The judge said, why did you do that?
[00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.250]  And it's because...
[00:50:25.719 --> 00:50:36.659]  They are talking to the Democrats and these law firms and these people and that's where they get this from and they're just desperate to get me off the air and they don't want somebody that's friendly to me to keep me on the air buying it.
[00:50:36.739 --> 00:50:44.739]  So they said they had an auction, but it was a secret private sale masquerading as an auction because that's what the federal law says they have to do.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.420]  So this is a major scandal.
[00:50:46.679 --> 00:50:47.579]  That's what went on.
[00:50:47.679 --> 00:50:48.980]  The Onion did not buy it.
[00:50:49.039 --> 00:50:50.699]  The judge said the sale did not go through.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.539]  There's a big hearing and This is in Bloomberg.
[00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:55.199]  It isn't AP, but it's buried in the articles.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.960]  This is a huge scandal.
[00:50:57.239 --> 00:50:58.699]  This is a giant deal.
[00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:06.579]  But through color of law, the feds came in and shut down the Infowars system today, but we're on our backup.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.260]  God bless you.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:07.780]  That's what happened.
[00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:09.320]  All right.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.679]  This is the last update.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.760]  I detailed all this on air today, but I learned even more tonight.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.760]  It's worse than I thought, but here it is very simply for everybody.
[00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:23.469]  There was an auction order by the judge, but he wanted to have more hearings about it for the details to make sure it was all legal.
[00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:29.750]  The U.S. Trustee, assigned with the Justice Department that was in charge of it, went ahead and had what he said was an auction.
[00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:41.769]  But then it came out that he didn't make the auction public, didn't let people have bids to go above the supposed highest bid, which means it's not a real auction.
[00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:46.889]  And then it turns out he ignored the highest bid and gave it to a lower bid because they were the Democrats.
[00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:52.530]  And so it was a private sale masquerading as an auction that did not happen.
[00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:53.889]  That's what the judge said today.
[00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.789]  He said it did not go through.
[00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:58.630]  He's having a full evidentiary hearing next week.
[00:51:58.769 --> 00:52:05.929]  In the meantime, the U.S. trustee, overstepping his power, came in and closed InfoWars and cut the broadcast off.
[00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.929]  So it is off the air.
[00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:14.510]  We're over at the Alex Jones Network, at AJN Live on X, and Real Alex Jones at the satellite uplink to the radio stations.
[00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.829]  The TV stations.
[00:52:15.909 --> 00:52:17.710]  They're having to switch over to our new satellite.
[00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:21.389]  There was some problems there because it was just sneak attack.
[00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.010]  Boom.
[00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.710]  They have the auction.
[00:52:22.809 --> 00:52:23.670]  Keep it secret Wednesday.
[00:52:24.409 --> 00:52:25.929]  This morning, they show up at 8 a.m.
[00:52:25.989 --> 00:52:26.690]  and say, shut the building.
[00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.210]  I go on and, you know, talk about it.
[00:52:29.269 --> 00:52:31.110]  Then they go order people to shut things off.
[00:52:31.369 --> 00:52:32.929]  Just saying, I'm a federal trustee.
[00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:33.550]  Do what I say.
[00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:40.210]  Like the last federal trustee did in June or late May, saying, shut the building with no court order.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.900]  I didn't leave.
[00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:43.480]  I threatened to call the police.
[00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:48.579]  And then they had an emergency hearing thinking I would be kicked out and the judge fired them.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:54.139]  So this is the second time, second federal trustee doing this wild vigilante crap.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.400]  So the onions everywhere announcing they bought it.
[00:52:56.599 --> 00:52:58.079]  The media is saying they got it.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.179]  But Bloomberg and AP are going, well, now the judge said, no, no, no, he's questioning it.
[00:53:02.239 --> 00:53:05.699]  No, he said it didn't go through and he's gonna decide what to do.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.239]  And my lawyers are like, well, they've taken this thing off the air.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.420]  These employees are out on the street.
[00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.650]  The judge said, well, as soon as we can have it, it's early next week, I'll give you a date.
[00:53:12.769 --> 00:53:13.670]  But yeah, this is crazy.
[00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:15.750]  So bring your evidence in.
[00:53:15.889 --> 00:53:17.170]  But he said, this is unbelievable.
[00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.050]  And he said, this is not an auction, this is a private sale.
[00:53:21.429 --> 00:53:22.750]  And this is not what I authorized.
[00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.369]  So that's what's going on, okay?
[00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:25.150]  That's the facts.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.619]  I know this is repetitive for the regular listeners to know everything, but the public still is confused.
[00:53:32.199 --> 00:53:36.360]  All right, Harrison Smith, you just showed me this earlier.
[00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:37.739]  I got other big news.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.840]  This is just InfoWars related.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.780]  It's related to everybody.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.099]  Obviously, this is related to you too as well, but this is really big.
[00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:46.320]  The Democrats promised that if Trump won in 2020, they would have their own government.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.280]  It wouldn't recognize him.
[00:53:47.579 --> 00:53:48.760]  It has begun.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.619]  They're doing it.
[00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:51.800]  Shadow government now becomes a parallel government.
[00:53:52.219 --> 00:53:53.059]  That's coming up.
[00:53:53.139 --> 00:53:53.739]  They have the clip.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.760]  We'll get to that in a few minutes.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.719]  But Harrison, you were here.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.280]  It was your show.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.219]  I commandeered yesterday.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.360]  You saw it all.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.619]  Some on the internet at first were like, because we broke it.
[00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.840]  Oh, yeah, right.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.480]  Show us.
[00:54:04.579 --> 00:54:08.159]  When you stick cameras in the Fed's faces, Bannon was on and said, do that.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.800]  They ran out of the building when we were going to, you know.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.219]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:11.659 --> 00:54:12.019]  So...
[00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.750]  But then they all did do it.
[00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:15.030]  People were like, yeah, we're not crying wolf.
[00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.349]  We've just survived a lot.
[00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:19.309]  But it does, even for the crew and myself, get weird.
[00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.769]  We, like, almost get destroyed and then God brings us back.
[00:54:22.389 --> 00:54:25.269]  So we're here in the studios Friday night, 5.52.
[00:54:25.989 --> 00:54:27.130]  What has it been like for you?
[00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:29.389]  It's been a complete whirlwind.
[00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:33.090]  I mean, it's great, you know, it's great that it didn't happen, but it's like...
[00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.710]  I feel like I still haven't even processed it yet, almost.
[00:54:36.989 --> 00:54:38.610]  It's so wild.
[00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.550]  It's wild to be back.
[00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:42.730]  It's wild that you had this victory, because that's really what this is.
[00:54:42.909 --> 00:54:43.289]  You had it, too.
[00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:45.250]  Well, yeah, we all had this victory.
[00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:45.909]  The listeners had it.
[00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.070]  They're the ones supporting us.
[00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.070]  I mean, I'm serious.
[00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.949]  I'm not just patting you on the head.
[00:54:48.949 --> 00:54:49.409]  It's you.
[00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.329]  I don't have any power without you.
[00:54:51.469 --> 00:54:57.489]  And that has been the most amazing thing about this, is the outpouring of love and support that is just...
[00:54:57.489 --> 00:54:57.849]  Point at them.
[00:54:57.889 --> 00:54:58.150]  Tell them.
[00:54:58.269 --> 00:54:58.690]  Who did it?
[00:54:59.139 --> 00:54:59.679]  You did!
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.360]  You did!
[00:55:00.619 --> 00:55:03.400]  Whoever's listening to me, if you hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:06.460]  And of course, that's always been your slogan, and this is why.
[00:55:07.039 --> 00:55:12.360]  And again, you know, so it's this, it's this like, first it's like this crushing feeling of like, oh my God, they're shutting us down.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.840]  I can't believe they finally did it.
[00:55:14.039 --> 00:55:16.780]  But then that's mixed with like the overwhelming support.
[00:55:17.099 --> 00:55:32.559]  I'm gonna get choked up to talk about it right now, because it's just, people understand that what we do here is real, is sincere, is It's just amazing to see people resonate with that and appreciate that.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:37.039]  And look, I am frankly mad at most conservatives.
[00:55:37.239 --> 00:55:38.340]  Like, thank God for Steve Bannon.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:41.500]  Thank God for all the people that have had our backs, because that's been amazing.
[00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:44.940]  But on the other hand, you know, where is the Fox News story about this?
[00:55:45.059 --> 00:55:45.760]  Where is the...
[00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:52.070]  You know, conservative version of a 60 Minutes documentary breaking down what's going on here.
[00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:57.269]  Because when you look at not just what's happened over the last, you know, couple of days, which in and of itself could be a miniseries.
[00:55:57.349 --> 00:56:03.380]  I mean, this is, you know, House of Cards level deception and backstabbing and Wild, wild stuff.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:10.099]  But going over the last couple years of what has led to this point is, you know, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:13.320]  It is beyond anything Hollywood writers could come up with.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:17.579]  And it's only happened because, you know, we've had the strategy.
[00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:19.940]  We've had the funds to be able to do it.
[00:56:20.019 --> 00:56:21.559]  We've actually achieved victory here.
[00:56:21.679 --> 00:56:25.880]  Thank God for Judge Lopez, because they had a different judge who was willing to go along with their crap.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.219]  I'm sure he could have certified all of the bogus nonsense they've tried to, you know...
[00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:46.550]  So, you know, a lot of beneficial, serendipitous things had to happen, but at the end of it all, it's persistence, and it's having the funds and the knowledge and the strategic know-how to go up against these people to achieve real victory, to get real change happen.
[00:56:46.710 --> 00:57:03.889]  Because when you got Elon Musk in there, his lawyers arguing with this, knowing the effects that this would have if they're able to get away with stealing your identity, stealing your name, and forcing them to hand over an X account, We're good to go.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.480]  We're putting it all on the table.
[00:57:17.619 --> 00:57:21.420]  We are all in on this mission to save America peacefully.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.980]  My dad was talking to me.
[00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.659]  He was watching everything go on.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.739]  And he was saying, yeah, I was with Steve Bannon.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.059]  Y'all should have put cameras in their faces.
[00:57:28.239 --> 00:57:30.400]  These people, they shouldn't be able to get away with this.
[00:57:30.539 --> 00:57:33.820]  They shouldn't be able to be these just faceless bureaucrats that never...
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.159]  And I said, well, look...
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.980]  Alex is playing nice.
[00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:39.599]  And I thought it was so funny when he kept saying, I'm nice, I'm being nice.
[00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:43.760]  And it's like we have not given them a single reason to treat us poorly.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.900]  We have not given them a single excuse to point and go, well, look how bad they are.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.739]  Look, they're trying to get our people in trouble.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.800]  They're trying to, you know, get our people hurt.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.460]  Their fans are going to target them.
[00:57:53.539 --> 00:57:54.360]  Now they're showing their face.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.760]  I mean, they could come up with stuff.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.579]  So the fact that you've played it so straight, that you've checked all the boxes...
[00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:01.000]  Ticked all the boxes.
[00:58:01.179 --> 00:58:02.579]  You've done it all by the book.
[00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:05.039]  And that's what's necessary to beat these people at their own game.
[00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:07.699]  So it's just been incredible.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:15.900]  It's been just back and forth, simultaneously horrifying and nightmarish and just a dream come true, weirdly, in a lot of ways.
[00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:18.340]  So it's been fascinating.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:25.219]  And frankly, even if I wasn't here, I would be glued to every minute of InfoWars because of the drama and the new developments that are constantly coming in.
[00:58:25.539 --> 00:58:30.340]  It is a drama beyond anything Hollywood could even come up with, but it's real.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.940]  It has real tangible effects.
[00:58:32.159 --> 00:58:34.280]  It's in the real world, people.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:46.440]  Not just here, our jobs, our ability to broadcast, but the ability of people in the future to take risks, to question official narratives, to speak their mind without the fear of being completely destroyed.
[00:58:46.639 --> 00:58:48.480]  Because 99% of people...
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:54.860]  We're good to go.
[00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:25.389]  I said yesterday on Twitter, if you told me in high school that one day, not only I would have a show on Infowars, but I would be sort of the last person on air before the feds pull the plug, I would have slapped you in the face because this is simultaneously a dream come true and a nightmare come to fruition.
[00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:27.230]  I always fantasized.
[00:59:27.329 --> 00:59:30.630]  I always had this dream, and I know a lot of people out there do, too.
[00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:33.469]  Whenever you see people going, oh, the feds are probably watching me.
[00:59:33.809 --> 00:59:34.889]  I'm a real rebel.
[00:59:34.989 --> 00:59:38.369]  In high school and middle school or whatever, it's like, yeah, I'm anti-government.
[00:59:38.369 --> 00:59:39.329]  I'm like a real rebel.
[00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:41.389]  They probably think I'm dangerous.
[00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.769]  And for the most part, they had no idea who I am.
[00:59:43.769 --> 00:59:44.949]  They know who I am now, right?
[00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:46.050]  They know who we are now.
[00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.570]  And we really are the rebels.
[00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.289]  We really are the rebels.
[00:59:51.069 --> 01:00:01.309]  The underdogs of just fighting with everything we've got against this faceless, massive, bottomless pit of money and malice and manipulation and...
[01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.849]  Absolutely.
[01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:03.050]  And the crew's great.
[01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:03.690]  They're exhausted.
[01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:05.869]  We went live 58 minutes ago.
[01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.769]  We took photos of me with the kitchen sink.
[01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:08.989]  I don't see that at Real Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:10.469]  I'm going to go get it and tweet it once you talk.
[01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:13.849]  We also haven't uploaded the incredible video of us with the sink.
[01:00:13.949 --> 01:00:14.849]  We showed it at the start.
[01:00:15.409 --> 01:00:17.010]  So I want to play that again in a moment.
[01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:17.210]  Wow.
[01:00:17.269 --> 01:00:18.329]  I've been seeing it all over the place.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:19.869]  I don't know where it got posted.
[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:20.969]  I'm not bitching.
[01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.150]  I'm just directing from my show.
[01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:25.309]  I just reposted the InfoWars feed on Real Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:27.409]  I want to make sure that we...
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.820]  Maybe I missed it.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:38.619]  I also want to make sure that we post it from the live feed of InfoWars on the AJN Live, the Alex Jones Network.
[01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.199]  This needs maximum coverage.
[01:00:40.739 --> 01:00:42.599]  This is absolutely huge.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.780]  And when this live feed is over, it's going to restream all weekend.
[01:00:46.019 --> 01:00:49.699]  So you can send this to people and say, see, the Onion doesn't have InfoWars.
[01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:52.579]  ABC, CNN, they all lied to you as usual.
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.250]  It was all bull.
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:55.789]  This is incredible.
[01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.469]  So, Harrison, you continue.
[01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:58.269]  I'm going to go check on some things.
[01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:59.250]  I'm going to be back with the big breaking news.
[01:00:59.289 --> 01:00:59.550]  Stay with us.
[01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:03.690]  Yeah, no, I've been enjoying Mike Binz's feed of this.
[01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:06.449]  He had a great comment on it that I was going to try to pull up.
[01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:13.010]  But, you know, just he says, you know, how can you not respect the sheer persistence of this man bringing in the sink and just not giving up?
[01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:13.730]  And that's what it's all about.
[01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.630]  And that was the comment that I wanted to see.
[01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:20.329]  He says, Netflix never made a series as fun as our current timeline.
[01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:22.309]  And that's what I wish people would understand.
[01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:23.710]  I almost feel bad for people.
[01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:28.949]  Kind of like how I feel bad for people that can't enjoy Trump, like people that aren't Trump supporters.
[01:01:29.579 --> 01:01:36.559]  And like they're watching Trump give a speech and they're just mad and they're vibrating with their anger and it's like, I feel bad for you.
[01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.519]  I wish you could see how much fun this is.
[01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:40.280]  I wish you could see what an epic...
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:57.440]  We're good to go.
[01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:22.730]  All our lives we watch these movies of heroes taking risks, going up against impossible odds, succeeding against insurmountable enemies, and when you're given the opportunity right now, right here, in real life, people let it pass by or they're willing to...
[01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:25.360]  Watch it from afar.
[01:02:25.539 --> 01:02:26.320]  You've got to be involved.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.420]  You've got to be a part of this.
[01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:34.300]  You've got to know that in the future, they're going to look back at what's happening today and study it as a sea change in American history.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:46.579]  Now, whether that's a future where they're teaching this as Alex Jones, this very bad guy, almost took down America, but we stopped him by suing him about a comment he made 10 years ago.
[01:02:46.739 --> 01:02:57.519]  Or whether we fight hard enough and give it our all and actually succeed in our mission to save America, in which case history will be taught reflecting reality.
[01:02:57.519 --> 01:03:07.230]  And we'll know that America, on our deathbed, as we were slowly being ushered in to the grave, we stood up, we fought back, We'll win.
[01:03:07.389 --> 01:03:08.829]  We will win in the end.
[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.650]  Good always wins in the end.
[01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.969]  And don't you want to be a part of that?
[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.289]  Don't you want to contribute to that?
[01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:19.309]  Don't you want to be able to talk to your grandkids about how bad it was back when you...
[01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.630]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.150]  I was telling you before we went live, I said, man, I hope...
[01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:25.909]  Because we're winning, but we need funds and legal fight to stay on air.
[01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:27.269]  And we really need it.
[01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:29.869]  I was like, well, he goes, I think we'll get some funding now.
[01:03:29.949 --> 01:03:30.769]  And that's starting to come in.
[01:03:30.969 --> 01:03:32.190]  Folks, we're fighting for you.
[01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:33.949]  This is pure Americana, this story.
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:36.289]  And we got great products at the AlexHillStore.com.
[01:03:36.929 --> 01:03:38.949]  The best supplements, great Patriot t-shirts.
[01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.449]  I mean, we need your help.
[01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.230]  My dad is a great guy, but a big sponsor.
[01:03:43.329 --> 01:03:46.829]  He didn't tell me in the last year and a half when he was getting sued and attacked and I needed money for help.
[01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.429]  He was like, I've got money, son.
[01:03:48.469 --> 01:03:49.070]  I've got money, son.
[01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:50.570]  And then I found out through family.
[01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.309]  They go, you know, your parents are completely out of money.
[01:03:52.689 --> 01:03:58.050]  They've, you know, mortgage stuff, and they've never been in that position, and I was like, new level of pissed off.
[01:03:58.329 --> 01:04:14.909]  So he's got the products, he's doing that, but he was giving all the money, and his money, and everything to help me, because I'm his son, and I was just like, and I didn't get a lot, I mean, he helped me so when I was a kid, but I had to have jobs and stuff, and I didn't, I didn't influence myself and everything, I brought him in here later to help do supplements, but I had no idea that they were just giving me,
[01:04:14.969 --> 01:04:22.739]  you know, basically everything they had in this, and now I'm really pissed off, but DRJonesNaturals.com, incredible supplements.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.920]  Everybody needs quercetin.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.219]  Everybody needs CoQ10.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.039]  It's so good for your whole body.
[01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:27.039]  This time of year, it's so key.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.219]  Great for your immune system.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.300]  It just cleans out the cells.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.239]  Great for your heart, everything.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.179]  They've got really high quality, just basic stuff like that that you're going to get at half the price for the same quality other places.
[01:04:36.199 --> 01:04:37.659]  Just go to DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.679]  Plus, you need it.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.940]  And at this point, it's not even keeping us on air because he's so up against the wall.
[01:04:43.019 --> 01:04:44.739]  I'm just trying to keep him from going completely under.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.920]  I mean, I'll just be honest.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.760]  This is my dad and my family.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.380]  I mean, they have shot the shit out of us.
[01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.409]  And they think it's funny.
[01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:52.429]  I'm going to fight even harder.
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:55.130]  And we're countersuing them and all the rest of this because we have to.
[01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:56.329]  They're never going to stop.
[01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.429]  So they want to fight.
[01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:58.010]  They've got one.
[01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:04.050]  Yeah, and look, I think I said it when we were on AJN Live yesterday.
[01:05:05.519 --> 01:05:08.099]  I think in some ways they drink their own Kool-Aid.
[01:05:08.179 --> 01:05:15.219]  They buy their own lies and they've convinced themselves that InfoWars and Alex Jones, he's a fraud and he's just some big galoot from Texas.
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.260]  You heard the guy.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.559]  He goes, we can do whatever we want to him.
[01:05:17.559 --> 01:05:18.300]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:05:20.139 --> 01:05:23.619]  So they buy their own lies and they're going to pay the price for it.
[01:05:23.739 --> 01:05:27.559]  And I think I also said, I don't remember if this was off air or not, so I'll just say it again.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.460]  You know, it's like the Russia collusion hoax with Donald Trump.
[01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:33.260]  There's never been anything more debunked than that.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.300]  It's been, you know, investigated ad nauseum, millions of dollars.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.019]  We all know the story.
[01:05:37.289 --> 01:05:38.309]  Well, same thing's happened here.
[01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:40.150]  Everything's public.
[01:05:40.289 --> 01:05:41.710]  Everything in the court record is public.
[01:05:41.989 --> 01:05:43.050]  They have gone through the books.
[01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:48.030]  Nobody out there can honestly say that what Alex just said isn't the truth.
[01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.969]  It is absolutely the truth.
[01:05:49.210 --> 01:06:05.590]  Everything that comes into this company goes right back into this fight, goes right back into just dedicated opposition and now offense, not just defense, against these, in my opinion, criminal scum that are doing this in a very blatant attempt to circumvent the First Amendment and destroy us through lawfare.
[01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.889]  It's the real deal.
[01:06:07.989 --> 01:06:08.550]  It's a real deal.
[01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:13.550]  If you've ever wanted to contribute to a mission, then not just, we don't just sit here and talk.
[01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:19.130]  And look, if all that you ever did was sit and talk about what's going on, I don't think they would have ever really cared.
[01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:20.610]  A lot of people talked about what went on.
[01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:22.070]  It was taking to the streets.
[01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:23.789]  It was taking the bullhorn to the buildings.
[01:06:23.929 --> 01:06:25.130]  It was leading marches.
[01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.610]  It was saying, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.449]  It was getting active.
[01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:28.769]  That's what makes Infowars.
[01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:29.650]  Owen said it perfectly.
[01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:32.190]  We reignited people's life force and survival instincts.
[01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:32.929]  There you go.
[01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.090]  And I remember before I worked at InfoWars, I would go buy things.
[01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.269]  It was like, you know what?
[01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:42.130]  This guy's out there on the street with a bullhorn.
[01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.550]  The least I can do is buy a t-shirt.
[01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:50.010]  I mean, my God, he's out there in the rain and snow yelling at globalists on my behalf.
[01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:50.690]  Yes, please.
[01:06:50.889 --> 01:06:51.130]  Thank you.
[01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:52.510]  I will support that with everything I've got.
[01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:55.829]  This is even more intense because this isn't just getting in their face.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:01.199]  And now we've drawn them out, and now it's like a battle, like a Roman standard between the left and right, the populist and the globalist.
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.500]  I mean, we're a real symbol like Trump they're trying to get.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:10.440]  This is your fight, folks, and thanks for backing us, but those that have been on the sidelines, maybe you share articles and stuff, thanks for doing that, but this is your fight.
[01:07:10.539 --> 01:07:11.579]  I mean, we're fighting for you.
[01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:12.500]  Absolutely.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.059]  And look, don't you need toothpaste?
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.800]  Don't you need just T-shirts?
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.679]  Don't you wear T-shirts every day?
[01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:23.440]  Like, just instead of buying these everyday things, just...
[01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:24.510]  Go to Dr.
[01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:25.170]  Jones Naturals.
[01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.289]  Like, it's really not that complicated.
[01:07:26.429 --> 01:07:27.969]  It's not even that much of a sacrifice.
[01:07:29.099 --> 01:07:30.559]  And we appreciate it more than you could ever.
[01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:32.639]  But to do this, we've got to sit here and beg you, which is true.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.599]  So we try to get a good product so you like it, you love them, and you want to get them again.
[01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:42.400]  You've got some other news here that we need to get to, and a lot of other big stuff has been breaking.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:50.739]  But as easy as it is for us to get stuck on what happened here, I mean, it is surreal to be, because, I mean, I was telling the crew, hey, we'll probably be back next week.
[01:07:51.139 --> 01:07:51.900]  And what did I tell you?
[01:07:52.039 --> 01:07:54.159]  You were at the meeting Monday or Tuesday.
[01:07:54.159 --> 01:07:56.019]  I said, hey, they're going to shut us down Thursday morning.
[01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:56.699]  Remember, I predicted it.
[01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:59.659]  Because I knew it was rigged then without having all the specifics.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.500]  I could just see the signs.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.860]  And then I was telling the crew, don't abandon ship.
[01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:04.539]  We'll be back regardless.
[01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:07.199]  We've got sponsors over here at Dallas Shows Network.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.260]  It's a smaller studio.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.360]  We're building a bigger one.
[01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:10.820]  But I was just like, hang in.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.460]  And most of the folks did believe me.
[01:08:12.739 --> 01:08:13.579]  Some didn't exactly.
[01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:20.689]  Yeah, well, and, you know, it was always sort of up in the air, like, all right, well, you know, we'll have to downsize a lot and then maybe, like, rebuild back up.
[01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:25.729]  But, frankly, the fact that the auction got overturned was shocking to all of us.
[01:08:25.989 --> 01:08:28.689]  It wasn't real, so they didn't let us back in.
[01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:29.109]  They had to.
[01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:29.869]  Right, right.
[01:08:30.489 --> 01:08:33.949]  But just the fact that they would even try that, what are they thinking?
[01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:34.529]  And this is the thing.
[01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:37.869]  If they had just played it straight, we would be out.
[01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:38.970]  We would not be in this studio.
[01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:44.390]  If they had just done a real bid with real money, we would have said, all right, we fought hard and we lost.
[01:08:44.449 --> 01:08:45.550]  We'll move on to the next thing.
[01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:47.989]  But it's like a compulsion.
[01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:49.909]  They're compelled to do shady stuff.
[01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:51.590]  They're compelled to be underhanded.
[01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:53.869]  And it screws them over at the end of the day.
[01:08:53.989 --> 01:08:55.949]  I mean, it's metaphorical.
[01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:56.930]  It's allegorical.
[01:08:57.069 --> 01:09:21.210]  It's like, what you're witnessing here We're good to go.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.710]  Yeah, well, just to tie this all in together What would have happened if they didn't cheat in 2020?
[01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:55.109]  You would have had Donald Trump with Mike Pence as a vice president, a Democrat Congress, a Democrat Senate.
[01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:59.850]  And at this point, we'd be two months away from the end of Donald Trump's presidential career.
[01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.050]  So again, they have to cheat.
[01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.470]  They are compelled to screw the system, to manipulate, to lie.
[01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:06.750]  And what ends up happening?
[01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:16.199]  Well, four years later, you get a Donald Trump who is more activated and more enraged and more, you know, We're good to go.
[01:10:40.039 --> 01:10:41.399]  We don't want to support that.
[01:10:41.899 --> 01:10:47.479]  We're not in favor of suing media companies for their reporting, but this is the world we're in.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:59.750]  So in the same way that this is the bed they've made, it's time for them to lay in it, When it comes to truth in media and being sued and being bankrupted for what you say, same thing's true in government.
[01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:09.430]  They have created an atmosphere where they are utterly tyrannical and they're just absolutely out of their minds doing everything they can to gain power.
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:22.710]  And it's like, if that's the way it is, Then we've got to play that game, because there's a built-in requirement in the American system for a sort of tit-for-tat, a, hey, if you're going to do that, just know I'm going to be in power next time, and I'm going to do it to you.
[01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:28.510]  And that was always in place, and it used to work to, you know, limit some of the ambitions of people.
[01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:36.470]  They'd go, well, I could do this, I could expand my power here, but then I might be out of office, and then they might use it against me, so I'll not do that now.
[01:11:36.729 --> 01:11:41.329]  And the Democrats have completely broken that unspoken or spoken social contract.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.760]  And at this point, you've got to go hard.
[01:11:44.859 --> 01:11:45.539]  You've got to go hard.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:51.039]  Even if it's something that you wouldn't want to do, don't typically want to do, doesn't fit in with your ideology, this is a fight for life and death.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.199]  It's survival at this point.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:12:00.100]  Trump and all of his appointees need to go absolute gloves off treating the threat that these people pose to the American system with the seriousness they deserve.
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.239]  I just saw this video.
[01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:03.680]  It was posted by Elijah Schaefer.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.500]  It says one of the most insane things they've openly admitted.
[01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:10.560]  I wouldn't even believe this if there wasn't video of it.
[01:12:11.579 --> 01:12:18.500]  He's got a sign that says shadow cabinet and they're actually talking about forming a shadow government, a true government.
[01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:30.869]  Deep State, in every sense of the word, to resist the Democratic vote of the people and oppose Trump, what it really means to usurp the power of the president to themselves, a total act of treason.
[01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:32.970]  So if we have that video, we can go to it.
[01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:33.909]  It's about two minutes long.
[01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:41.449]  And for our radio listeners, he's staying next to a sign that says, Shadow Cabinet with all of the seals of the different government agencies.
[01:12:41.729 --> 01:12:42.329]  Here it is.
[01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:55.569]  If Trump attempts to weaponize the justice system against his political opponents with Matt Gaetz at the helm, we could see incoming Senator Adam Schiff as our shadow Attorney General, arguing against replacing our independent prosecutors with Trump loyalists.
[01:12:55.930 --> 01:13:07.550]  If Trump seeks to eliminate the Department of Education, Congresswoman Johanna Hayes, a former Teacher of the Year, could step up as Shadow Education Secretary to loudly defend public education in the United States.
[01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:25.430]  If Trump orders Marco Rubio to hand Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Congressman Greg Meeks, as Shadow Secretary of State, could be a strong voice in support of maintaining international relationships and protecting democracy at home and abroad.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:42.439]  Senator Michael Bennett as shadow Treasury Secretary and Congresswoman Susan DelBene as shadow Commerce Secretary could help ensure the middle class and small businesses have a voice in government and call out Trump's proposed tax cuts for billionaires and corporations.
[01:13:43.390 --> 01:14:01.970]  A shadow defense secretary, Congressman Adam Smith, a great representative for the people of Washington and not a Fox News host, could counter Trump's threat to use military force against his political opponents and work to ensure that the Department of Defense stays loyal to the Constitution and not some wannabe dictator.
[01:14:02.829 --> 01:14:11.909]  And Senator Tammy Duckworth could argue against cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs that would delay the benefits and care our service members have so rightly earned.
[01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:25.260]  If Trump hands over the EPA to big oil ally Lee Zeldin, we could see Congresswoman Kathy Castor pushing back for environmental protection and conservation to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:40.579]  And if Trump pushes to ban abortion nationwide, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro could step in as Shadow Secretary of Health and Human Services to defend women's right to choose and argue against the gutting of Medicare by Trump and his cronies.
[01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:42.529]  Mr.
[01:14:42.529 --> 01:14:44.729]  Speaker, new times require new solutions.
[01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:50.149]  The Shadow Cabinet isn't just about opposing extreme MAGA attacks on our government.
[01:14:50.409 --> 01:14:55.449]  It's also about making clear what we stand for, not just what we're against.
[01:14:58.009 --> 01:15:08.270]  That's normalizing shadow government, giving themselves government titles, having a fake auction claiming that the Democrat gun control group to the Onion bought InfoWars wasn't true.
[01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.649]  We're back.
[01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.310]  It's overturned.
[01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:11.710]  It's like impossible to...
[01:15:13.489 --> 01:15:15.630]  Really comprehend just how...
[01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:17.170]  I don't have enough words for it.
[01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:18.449]  It's beyond hypocrisy.
[01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:19.149]  It's beyond anything.
[01:15:19.369 --> 01:15:21.289]  And I know we say it enough.
[01:15:21.289 --> 01:15:22.810]  It's just cliche at this point.
[01:15:22.949 --> 01:15:25.770]  But you want to talk about destroying democracy.
[01:15:25.869 --> 01:15:27.329]  We voted for Donald Trump.
[01:15:27.449 --> 01:15:28.210]  These people are saying...
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.340]  The American people voted for Donald Trump to enact these certain policies, but if he tries to enact those policies, we are going to try to stop him.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.920]  And he moderates his language a little bit.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:42.880]  He says, well, Tammy Duckworth, she can be the shadow secretary of whatever to argue for this, this, this.
[01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:44.720]  Well, you can argue as a congressman.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.859]  You can argue as a senator.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.060]  You can argue all you want.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:47.920]  That's what the system's for.
[01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:48.939]  Go ahead and argue.
[01:15:49.079 --> 01:16:02.399]  If you're talking about setting up a shadow cabinet to undermine And usurp the power of the President of the United States and deny the American people our ability to choose our future out of at least two options.
[01:16:02.539 --> 01:16:03.439]  We chose Donald Trump.
[01:16:03.579 --> 01:16:04.539]  We chose Donald Trump.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.039]  We chose him because he wants to shut down the war in Ukraine, because he wants to put RFK Jr.
[01:16:10.619 --> 01:16:13.359]  on Health and Human Services and get the poison out of our food and water.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.619]  We chose that.
[01:16:14.619 --> 01:16:29.819]  So they are just in the most deliberate and Absolutely.
[01:16:31.539 --> 01:16:33.520]  Well said, my friend.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.039]  Well, you're going to be back 8 a.m.
[01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.899]  from the InfoWars studios on Monday unless the left...
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:44.579]  You know, unless Biden, while he's still in power, calls it an airstrike on us or causes World War III. Great job to you.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.439]  God bless you.
[01:16:45.619 --> 01:16:48.880]  We're going to bring the great Chase Geyser in here with some closing comments.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.479]  Then I'm going to end this live transmission.
[01:16:50.479 --> 01:16:55.680]  It'll re-loop here on the InfoWars feed in-house to the folks at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:01.859]  Band out video that's now back up under our control because the fraud's being exposed and more to come.
[01:17:01.939 --> 01:17:02.640]  The fight's not over yet.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.500]  We just won a major battle.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:08.579]  And then, of course, we're doing the restreams of the huge show today with tens of millions of viewers out there.
[01:17:08.909 --> 01:17:14.409]  And we'll all be back Sunday night, myself and Chase Geyser with Sunday Night Live, 4 to 8 p.m.
[01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.149]  Pray for us.
[01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:19.010]  I'm going to air myself on Glenn Beck this morning before even more came out.
[01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:21.989]  Look how accurate this is now with what I was saying.
[01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:23.449]  That's about 10 minutes long.
[01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:26.550]  And then we're going to have Chase Geyser in here for closing comments.
[01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:28.270]  And then this amazing crew gets some sleep.
[01:17:28.789 --> 01:17:32.470]  And in case something crazy breaks tomorrow, we deserve a day of rest.
[01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:36.109]  And so we're going to take off at least some tomorrow.
[01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:41.890]  Unless it's a total emergency, I will not, probably will be, I will not be back up here tomorrow.
[01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:43.930]  I'll let everybody get back to their family.
[01:17:44.029 --> 01:17:44.630]  Great job, the crew.
[01:17:44.729 --> 01:17:45.170]  I love you.
[01:17:45.329 --> 01:17:46.689]  Thank you for putting up with everything, going through this.
[01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:47.210]  You're warriors.
[01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:47.909]  You're amazing.
[01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:48.489]  This is history.
[01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:49.970]  We're part of something really special here.
[01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:51.670]  So Harrison Smith, thank you so much, my friend.
[01:17:51.909 --> 01:17:53.710]  Thank you, and thank you to the InfoWars audience.
[01:17:53.710 --> 01:18:00.210]  It's all because of you, and honestly, the outpouring of support and love that I've experienced over the last few days is totally overwhelming.
[01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:01.350]  I can't even express it.
[01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:02.289]  Everybody should follow you.
[01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:05.909]  Oh, at Harrison H. Smith, at Harrison H. Smith on X. Yeah, and I'll see you on Monday.
[01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:09.550]  Remember, everybody's allowed to grab our feeds and repost them, restream them.
[01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.590]  You should be streaming the show every day.
[01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:12.890]  It's all about power of the people.
[01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.909]  Everybody owns this show, belongs to the people.
[01:18:15.029 --> 01:18:15.609]  They can never own it.
[01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:16.550]  They can never control InfoWars.
[01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:17.069]  It's all a lie.
[01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.890]  God bless you, brother.
[01:18:18.199 --> 01:18:18.560]  Thank you.
[01:18:18.779 --> 01:18:20.539]  All right, here is the Glenn Beck interview this morning.
[01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:22.640]  It's 9.30 in the morning.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.960]  And look how it all came true.
[01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:24.720]  I know it's all accurate.
[01:18:24.939 --> 01:18:29.880]  And then we're going to bring in Chase Geiser, and that's going to be it for this Friday night emergency transmission.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:37.020]  And then, my Paul Revere, you just share those links at Real Alex Jones and at the Infoworks feed on X and at AJN Live.
[01:18:37.319 --> 01:18:40.680]  And George Soros, the Neural Order, will not be too happy.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:41.859]  Stay with us.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:44.979]  I've got major breaking news.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.220]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:53.800]  And I'm going to tell people, first off, the FBI testified in the show trial in Connecticut two years ago on TV. I didn't know this until then.
[01:18:53.899 --> 01:18:54.600]  They hit it in plain view.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.760]  That their chief counsel in Connecticut created the suits, organized the people.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.520]  They got the PR firms.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  They hyped up and exaggerated what I did.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.939]  For two years, used my name to raise money for their anti-gun, anti-First Amendment groups.
[01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:27.729]  And then sued me, then found me in default, said I was guilty, and then had show trials literally produced by HBO. Now, moving on from that, the federal judge, Lopez, just two months ago, very famously, when the last CRO and U.S. trustee appointed by the Justice Department,
[01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:31.569]  the judge agreed to it because they wanted to come into the case because it's so publicized.
[01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:32.630]  The Justice Department can do that.
[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:34.010]  They have a whole office of bankruptcy.
[01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:40.010]  They then tried to close the doors in late May without a court order.
[01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:41.590]  We got a hearing in two weeks.
[01:19:41.729 --> 01:19:43.050]  I refused to let them close the doors.
[01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:46.430]  I said I'd call the police when they came and told me to get out of the building.
[01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:54.470]  And then the judge fired the federal trustee and the CRO, but appointed a new one that was next to the rotation.
[01:19:55.170 --> 01:20:00.649]  Now, the new one comes in and says, okay, well, Alex Jones is in bankruptcy too.
[01:20:00.869 --> 01:20:02.890]  We're going to move to sell it at auction.
[01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:17.470]  The judge says yes, but then they come out a few months ago, it was all over the news, and the trustee said, I'm going to sell the name Alex Jones Show, and I'm going to sell the name Real Alex Jones on X. Elon Musk lawyers got involved.
[01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:18.210]  They were there, by the way.
[01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:20.890]  It gets worse.
[01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.149]  But here's the new news.
[01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:31.529]  The judge, a month ago in a hearing, said, no, you must have new hearings on when you're going to have an option, and we have to have hearings on this.
[01:20:31.529 --> 01:20:33.329]  So they withdrew their claim on my name.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.760]  Chris Murray, the new trustee, and this is all in the news, and the transcripts are public from the hearing yesterday.
[01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:47.159]  He, without the judge's authorization, the judge said this, went ahead with the auction, but here's the breaking news.
[01:20:47.279 --> 01:20:51.890]  The judge said, this is even in Bloomberg yesterday, I did not authorize you to have this auction.
[01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:56.390]  We were supposed to have hearings because you were making claims that violate the 13th Amendment against slavery.
[01:20:56.529 --> 01:20:59.109]  It's not just the eighth and the first they're violating, as you just said.
[01:20:59.909 --> 01:21:05.949]  And then Chris Murray is in Bloomberg and in the filing saying the 13th Amendment does not apply to Alex Jones, close quote, in a filing.
[01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:08.729]  So all of those amendments are attempting to be destroyed.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:17.739]  Then, I waited yesterday until I said this to all my lawyers, some of them are the top bankruptcy people, said I'm authorized to say this literally 30 minutes ago.
[01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:20.159]  The filings will be filed within one hour.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.079]  Now, get ready for this.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:39.779]  Not only did they have this fake auction, the judge said it was fake, They took $1.7 million cash, as you just said, pledged the rest in future money they get from me, when the judge's order was,
[01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:48.979]  it's a cash auction, and now basically, this is what the judge said, this was a private secret sale disguised as an auction.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.000]  Yep.
[01:21:50.239 --> 01:22:12.970]  They then ignored the highest bid that was way, way, way, way, way, way larger, and The judge then excoriated them and said, we are now going to have a full evidentiary hearing sometime next week.
[01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:14.869]  And my lawyers are filing.
[01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:16.069]  They say it's cut and dry.
[01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:17.710]  They're not bomb throwers.
[01:22:17.909 --> 01:22:21.550]  Cut and dry in their own admissions and Murray's own admissions on the stand.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:27.760]  That they had bid collusion because none of the bidders are supposed to talk to each other.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.300]  You have to disclose if there's another group.
[01:22:29.439 --> 01:22:31.600]  You have to disclose if you're going to change the auction.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.979]  And then now claim that it's not cash, it's a credit auction, but they didn't even do that.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.039]  And here's the key.
[01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:50.789]  Murray put out two months ago for the auction that November 8th was the last day to have your first initial bid in and it would be online with a big auction company and people could bid up.
[01:22:50.909 --> 01:22:53.989]  That's the definition of an auction is sold to the highest bidder in Webster's dictionary.
[01:22:54.289 --> 01:22:57.250]  So then they have this private sale disguised as an auction.
[01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:12.529]  Then they announce on Monday The 11th, at 2 p.m., via email to my lawyers and everybody, we're disregarding the old auction filings and the money that was put down and the nondisclosures that were signed and the regular federal contracts that follow the law.
[01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:18.050]  We're now going to have sealed bids in on Wednesday, November 13th at 10 a.m.
[01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:22.710]  There will be no further bids above that, which is not an auction.
[01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:27.409]  And then we will choose, including we reserve the right to take a lesser bid.
[01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:28.810]  So it was already fixed then.
[01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:30.869]  And then that went forward.
[01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:34.550]  So this is 100%, 100% cut and dry legal.
[01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:34.789]  Sorry.
[01:23:34.989 --> 01:23:36.850]  So here's the thing, Alex.
[01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:46.069]  A settlement against somebody is to make the people that are suing whole.
[01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:50.810]  There is a difference between restoration and retribution.
[01:23:51.899 --> 01:24:06.000]  If the people want that, you know, we're not going after retribution, but restoration, then that fine that you got, then you had to pay the families, was to restore them.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:11.680]  They can't suddenly say, well, we'll get this money from Alex...
[01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:21.090]  While we take away his business and even his name, you're not going to get any money from Alex.
[01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:28.869]  And the reason why you would have an auction when somebody goes bankrupt is to make the other people whole.
[01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:32.729]  This is clearly about retribution.
[01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:34.689]  And Glenn, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:34.789 --> 01:24:37.170]  They said on the courthouse steps in both rig cases...
[01:24:37.479 --> 01:24:43.500]  And they said in their filings, and they said in the Onion announcement, this is about punishing him and taking him off the air.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:55.199]  And the Democrat lawyer that runs all this, absolutely, and the head Democrat lawyer out of Connecticut that runs all this, said on ABC News last night, Alex Jones' punishment has just begun.
[01:24:55.319 --> 01:25:02.199]  Listen, they turned down $70 million from me that I agreed to pay out over a period of years that I wasn't even sure I could make.
[01:25:02.479 --> 01:25:05.020]  More money, as you said, rightfully than I've ever made.
[01:25:05.359 --> 01:25:06.539]  And so they admit this.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.199]  They're not even...
[01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:08.229]  Denying.
[01:25:08.329 --> 01:25:21.210]  And what's crazy is they're so arrogant that when the judge said, do an auction months ago, they acted like they were going to do an auction up to two days before, less than 48 hours before on Monday afternoon.
[01:25:21.609 --> 01:25:26.229]  They throw out the real auction, pretend they have an auction, and this is cut and dry.
[01:25:26.409 --> 01:25:27.829]  And then they admit...
[01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:29.289]  That they did all of this.
[01:25:29.409 --> 01:25:32.470]  And again, the judge's order said a cash auction.
[01:25:32.829 --> 01:25:40.609]  This wasn't even a credit auction, as you said, promising my future earnings for them to be able to buy my company.
[01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:44.409]  It is so ridiculously fraudulent.
[01:25:44.779 --> 01:25:49.500]  On his face that my lawyers are speechless right now that they would try this.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:58.939]  But again, they admit that the Justice Department is heavily involved in directing all of this, just like they got caught directing all the lawfare against Trump.
[01:25:59.119 --> 01:26:06.279]  And they admit on MSNBC and CNN, this model being used against me, if they're successful, will then be used.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.680]  And they've literally said the names in previous shows years ago, Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck.
[01:26:11.819 --> 01:26:13.579]  So I don't know if you've seen those newscasts.
[01:26:13.619 --> 01:26:13.920]  I can send them.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.199]  Send them to me.
[01:26:15.319 --> 01:26:16.600]  I'd like to see that.
[01:26:16.979 --> 01:26:19.899]  Look, Alex, Trump won.
[01:26:20.539 --> 01:26:33.720]  We are cleaning out the DOJ. I... I don't want to get involved in lawsuits because I'm not a judge, I'm not an attorney, and I'm not a jury.
[01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:41.300]  But I will insert myself when you see clear injustice against the Constitution.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.199]  And I can quote the 8th and the 1st.
[01:26:45.279 --> 01:26:48.739]  I hadn't thought of the 13th, but you say your attorney quoted that one.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:55.100]  It is clear that this is cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:26:55.909 --> 01:27:00.569]  It is also retribution and an excessive fine.
[01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:03.270]  And it's all based on freedom of speech.
[01:27:03.449 --> 01:27:05.189]  This is not going to stand, Alex.
[01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:20.069]  And I hope that when the DOJ is cleaned up, this comes up and they prosecute anyone who did anything illegal in this case.
[01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:21.550]  I totally agree.
[01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:23.729]  And Glenn, if you have time, just one last key point.
[01:27:23.729 --> 01:27:24.750]  It gets worse.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:30.920]  So they have the secret fake auction Wednesday at 1030.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.760]  They say, we'll tell you sometime tomorrow morning.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.119]  I figure something's going on.
[01:27:36.439 --> 01:27:47.680]  So I get to the office right at 730 when the call and the emails come through to my lawyers that you didn't get your IP, you didn't get your equipment, you didn't get everything, nothing.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.619]  And then Chris Murray, the U.S. trustee, Shows up at 8 a.m.
[01:27:53.239 --> 01:28:05.840]  right as I go on one of my other hosts has a live show, so I took it over at 8 a.m., and I'm there, and he's ordering my crew saying, I'm a federal agent, because when he does his little hearings, he has the Justice Department seal behind him.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:13.060]  He says, you were ordered to turn this off, or I'm going to have you violating the state.
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:15.119]  You're going to get in trouble with the court.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:24.239]  So he basically intimidated my IT people To at 10.30 in the morning, pull the plug on live broadcast when it wasn't a real auction.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.100]  The judge hadn't authorized an auction yet.
[01:28:27.239 --> 01:28:28.739]  He had just authorized to have one in the future.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.420]  And the judge said all this in court.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:36.899]  So they literally hijacked the building, turned the power off, turned the satellite off to the radio and TV stations.
[01:28:37.079 --> 01:28:41.279]  Luckily, we built a backup studio, which we're calling the Alex Jones Network.
[01:28:41.539 --> 01:28:44.520]  People can follow that on x at AJNLive.com.
[01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:45.789]  Or real Alex Jones.
[01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:55.489]  And luckily we got in contact with most of our radio stations and only five minutes late got our satellite link that was already up and ready, you know, to them.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.500]  But this is literally—I'm not exaggerating any of this.
[01:28:59.619 --> 01:29:01.220]  This is all going to be filed in federal court today.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.800]  Anybody listening that says this doesn't sound real, I understand.
[01:29:04.159 --> 01:29:05.119]  It's in Bloomberg.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:13.460]  It's everywhere if you read deeper in the articles that the judge, quote, you know, has serious questions about transparency, that he said the sale didn't go through.
[01:29:13.699 --> 01:29:18.560]  And here they are everywhere saying The Onion bought it and all this, and it's not even true.
[01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:24.609]  So imagine— And all that, people I've talked to said there's no way the judge doesn't at least order a new real auction.
[01:29:24.869 --> 01:29:26.710]  But there's probably going to be more.
[01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:35.729]  The law says that the real big bidder, by law, it will be forfeited to them, and they wouldn't have to face the jeopardy of another auction.
[01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:43.590]  So there's a very good chance with these emergency injunctions today that I will be back in control of the Infowars building and studios and systems.
[01:29:44.269 --> 01:29:50.130]  Perhaps by this afternoon, but 99% chance by the full evidentiary hearing next week, Glenn.
[01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:53.869]  This is epic desperateness and vigilantism by the desperate left.
[01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:55.529]  Thank you very much, Alex Jones.
[01:29:55.829 --> 01:30:04.989]  You can follow him at alexjones.network, alexjones.network, and of course on x at realalexjones.com.
[01:30:05.649 --> 01:30:13.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next few minutes, wrapping up this broadcast on this historic day when we are back in the Infowars studio.
[01:30:14.529 --> 01:30:20.489]  And it has been absolutely 100% the craziest 48 hours of my life.
[01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:25.170]  I didn't get any sleep last night, so I apologize if I am slurring my words or tired.
[01:30:27.289 --> 01:30:29.770]  I just couldn't sleep because I was so excited.
[01:30:29.890 --> 01:30:30.789]  The energy was so high.
[01:30:32.170 --> 01:30:49.979]  And You know, I was thinking about what this was like and comparing it to movies that I've seen because, frankly, epic movies or TV shows that I've seen are the closest thing I've ever experienced to what I actually in reality experienced over the course of the last two days.
[01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:58.840]  And last night when we were broadcasting from the Alex Jones Network, I likened our experience here to Wolf of Wall Street.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.159]  We have a promo that we've been running.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.640]  I'm not leaving.
[01:31:03.039 --> 01:31:03.859]  Meant to inspire.
[01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:05.539]  That resonates for sure.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:16.359]  There's this one minute clip that I want to show you because this 60 second clip is exactly like how it's been the last two days at Inf Wars.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.359]  And I speak for myself, of course, but I think I can speak for the crew.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.479]  I think they'll see what I mean when they watch this clip.
[01:31:23.119 --> 01:31:26.319]  And the reason I want to show this is a scene from Band of Brothers, one of my favorite shows.
[01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:28.520]  Outstanding book as well.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:38.829]  Is because we can't change What happens to us, but we can always decide how we respond.
[01:31:40.369 --> 01:31:51.350]  And ultimately, I think that is the test of the human condition, what it means to be a man, how you respond to your environment, what happens to you that's out of your control.
[01:31:51.609 --> 01:31:52.750]  Some people buckle.
[01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:54.069]  They become afraid.
[01:31:54.989 --> 01:31:57.229]  They just comply and submit.
[01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:00.750]  Others fight back and fail.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:18.859]  And I've reached a certain point, and I've been here the least amount of time of anyone, where all of the attacks have been so ridiculous and outrageous and incessant and existential, that I'm totally calloused.
[01:32:19.279 --> 01:32:20.819]  Oh, we're going back to the Infowar Studio?
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.560]  Okay, let's broadcast from the Infowar Studio to our millions of listeners.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.579]  Oh, we can't broadcast from the Infowar Studio?
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.699]  Okay, let's go to the Alex Jones Network Studio and reach the same people.
[01:32:30.569 --> 01:32:31.829]  Oh, they're shutting this down.
[01:32:31.989 --> 01:32:33.250]  Oh, they're trying to silence this.
[01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:34.149]  Oh, they're going to file this.
[01:32:34.289 --> 01:32:37.470]  Oh, we can't close this deal.
[01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:38.350]  We're not allowed to do this deal.
[01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:41.170]  They're going to shut everything down.
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:42.010]  Maybe we won't have jobs.
[01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.789]  Oh, okay, whatever.
[01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:43.909]  I'm so callous to it.
[01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:49.789]  At this point, it's like, okay, that is just the condition, the environment that we were in in InfoWars.
[01:32:49.949 --> 01:33:06.180]  It's frankly the environment that we're in in the United States of America, at least until the inauguration, where there's just this litany of This cacophony, this astronomical,
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:14.319]  asinine amount of just abuse and neglect, and ultimately, I think the best word is disregard for the rights of the American people.
[01:33:16.119 --> 01:33:27.930]  Namely, free speech, basically all of the Bill of Rights, gruel and unusual punishment, right to assemble, freedom of religion, right to bear arms, Due process.
[01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:32.010]  Hell, even quartering with the migrants that have been allowed into this country.
[01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:33.449]  Total disregard.
[01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:41.569]  And now, it's like that scene from Risky Business with Tom Cruise from the 80s, that movie.
[01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:49.510]  Where his friend says, hey man, sometimes you just have to say, what the F word.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.979]  And protest and just say, no, no, no.
[01:33:54.079 --> 01:33:55.600]  I'm not going to tolerate this.
[01:33:55.659 --> 01:33:56.619]  I'm not going to let this get to me.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.699]  I'm not going to yield to this.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:05.319]  I'm just going to go into the most dangerous, risky situation possible to accomplish what I want to accomplish.
[01:34:05.659 --> 01:34:07.380]  And I don't care what the outcome is.
[01:34:07.579 --> 01:34:15.180]  All I care is that I run in as fast as I can through the storm, not away from the storm, through the storm.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:15.760]  Let's run the clip.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:20.739]  I'm taking over.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.180]  Mortals and grenade launchers on that building till it's gone.
[01:34:23.279 --> 01:34:24.579]  When it's gone, I want first to go straight in.
[01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:25.119]  Forget going around.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.180]  Everybody else follow me.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:26.579]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:28.460]  Sir, I think they're gonna pull back.
[01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:30.439]  If we don't connect with I, they're gonna slip away.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:30.800]  That's right.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:31.340]  Wait here.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.600]  What the hell?
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.500]  At first, the Germans didn't shoot at him.
[01:34:42.579 --> 01:34:44.600]  I think they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing.
[01:34:45.739 --> 01:34:47.420]  But that wasn't the really astounding thing.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.779]  The astounding thing was that after he hooked up with iCompany...
[01:34:51.779 --> 01:34:52.579]  He came back?
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:53.140]  He came back.
[01:34:59.659 --> 01:35:01.039]  I'm dying, bud!
[01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:23.989]  You know, one of my favorite movies is Cool Hand Luke, and there's a couple of scenes from that movie as well that have come to mind oftentimes since I started working here.
[01:35:24.729 --> 01:35:37.649]  First of all, of course, the famous boxing scene where Paul Newman's character refuses to give up, even though he's much weaker, an inferior opponent in this boxing match.
[01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:40.989]  He's totally outsized, outmatched, getting absolutely pummeled.
[01:35:41.609 --> 01:35:48.449]  But ultimately he wins the fight because everyone walks away from the field and he's still standing.
[01:35:48.630 --> 01:35:49.630]  He's still getting back up.
[01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:56.569]  And then the famous scene from Cool Hand Luke is sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:18.100]  And when they've taken everything from you, when they sue you for 1.5 billion dollars, when they threaten to shut down your life's work, when they threaten to take everything that you ever held dear, when they succeed, then in a way you become more powerful than you've ever been before.
[01:36:19.819 --> 01:36:21.579]  Because you have nothing to lose.
[01:36:24.899 --> 01:36:31.800]  And that's the mentality that I've fallen in here, that I'm proud to work here with this crew, these audacious patriots.
[01:36:32.079 --> 01:36:35.199]  Any number of them could get jobs anywhere else making more money.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:47.920]  But out of sheer loyalty and audacity and frankly just will, these men that I work with have elected to do the right thing.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.819]  Because sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
[01:36:52.359 --> 01:37:00.899]  And sometimes when you're in the middle of a crazy battle in Bastogne, the only solution is to run right into the enemy.
[01:37:02.819 --> 01:37:04.720]  And that's the situation we're in right now.
[01:37:06.199 --> 01:37:10.680]  Mainstream media is collapsing right before our eyes.
[01:37:11.409 --> 01:37:15.630]  It's collapsing similar to how the economy collapsed in 1929.
[01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:17.470]  It's happening rapidly.
[01:37:17.890 --> 01:37:21.470]  They're in denial right now, which is the first stage of grief.
[01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:24.869]  And they are lashing out in their desperation.
[01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:28.710]  They hate Infowars because we are the competition.
[01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:41.050]  We are the very medium, alternative media, that has rendered legacy corporate mainstream media moot.
[01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:45.069]  They're totally unnecessary.
[01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:48.710]  They're not just unnecessary, they're frankly harmful.
[01:37:48.989 --> 01:37:50.649]  They should have a right to be harmful.
[01:37:50.649 --> 01:37:51.329]  That's fine.
[01:37:51.489 --> 01:37:58.529]  If they want to spew bull crap with their tacky aesthetic and their crappy production and their teleprompters.
[01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:10.189]  I mean, if you turn on CNN and MSNBC, any of these mainstream networks, it feels like a valedictorian giving you the graduation speech pre-written.
[01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:13.029]  People are literally...
[01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:20.550]  I think?
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.359]  To reinforce their delusion.
[01:38:38.539 --> 01:38:47.159]  It's actually exactly the same thing that we see with the transgender movement, where they insist that you refer to them by the gender that they prefer, despite the fact that it's not reality.
[01:38:48.239 --> 01:39:01.239]  Because there's something wrong where they have to see someone else acknowledge what they want to feel or what they're going through in order for it to be bearable for them.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:03.479]  It's like a cope.
[01:39:03.899 --> 01:39:14.699]  And that's the only service, the only value that mainstream media brings to any person, any consumer, any audience member, any viewer, any reader.
[01:39:15.899 --> 01:39:29.020]  The only value they really bring to their audience is bolstering up, strengthening up their own delusion regarding the way they perceive the world.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:47.180]  It just allows people to go on being ignorant and asleep and comfortable without facing the harsh reality that the reason they're struggling is not because of some external injustice but some internal failure.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:58.239]  They would never look within to improve themselves because if they were to look within they would see nothing but an abyss.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:06.680]  So massive, like a black hole, it would suck their soul into itself until they were nothing.
[01:40:06.859 --> 01:40:08.380]  Not even any light could escape.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.140]  The gravitational pull would be so strong.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:20.680]  And InfoWars is a pioneer in this alternative media space because of the work that Alex has done and this crew has done over the course of the last several decades.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.619]  But it's not just InfoWars anymore.
[01:40:23.619 --> 01:40:24.500]  It's the Joe Rogans.
[01:40:24.619 --> 01:40:25.880]  It's the Tucker Carlson's.
[01:40:27.699 --> 01:40:28.640]  It's the Nick Sordors.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.479]  It's all of these independent voices.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:44.460]  So many of the hundreds of guests that we've had on this network have the audacity to put a camera up and broadcast to whoever would be willing to listen how they perceive things to be true.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:41:02.880]  Instead of expressing what they know you wish were true in exchange for ad revenue and kickback and political gain, They had within themselves some demand, some need to just say what they really thought.
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.000]  And for that, they're criticized and ridiculed and campaigned against?
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.399]  And the targets of lawfare and assassination attempts?
[01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:14.039]  And slander?
[01:41:15.819 --> 01:41:19.119]  Accusations of being bigoted, Nazis, xenophobic.
[01:41:19.779 --> 01:41:22.260]  Every terrible thing you could imagine about a person.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:30.859]  Ultimately because the truth is the greatest threat to this political establishment, this private political press, this political class.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:39.319]  So the real reason they're coming after Alex Jones and Infowars and all the other alternative outlets is not because of anything that they say that they get wrong.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.279]  It's because of everything they say that's true.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.939]  Everything they say that they get right.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:54.000]  Because even the smallest amount of light, truth, eviscerates an infinite amount of darkness.
[01:41:54.279 --> 01:41:56.479]  Folks, we're going to wrap up this broadcast.
[01:41:56.619 --> 01:41:57.600]  It's been an honor and a pleasure.
[01:41:57.819 --> 01:41:59.800]  I will see you Sunday night live.
[01:42:00.079 --> 01:42:06.920]  Please follow at AJNLive and go to thealexjonesstore.com to be the reason Alex Jones will always be on the air.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:23.079]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, InfoWars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:32.560]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public, and people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:42:33.159 --> 01:42:36.920]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:37.560]  Who knows?
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.539]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:42:40.819 --> 01:42:55.180]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty, having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:42:55.479 --> 01:42:59.600]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:08.909]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjohnstore.com, We're good to go.
[01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:32.989]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:36.550]  But that's going to get announced, the winner, here in just a few days.
[01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:40.729]  And regardless of whether InfoWars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:44.229]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement, we're going to invite them to Austin, and so much more.
[01:43:45.710 --> 01:43:53.390]  We're gonna do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the darkest hour giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:53.789 --> 01:43:59.310]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:43:59.529 --> 01:44:00.770]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[01:44:00.949 --> 01:44:01.890]  It's a beautiful truck.
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.819]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.779]  And there's so much more at thealexjonesstore.com.

[01:46:14.729 --> 01:46:22.550]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[01:46:22.649 --> 01:46:28.029]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:43.979]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,

[01:47:39.949 --> 01:47:40.869]  It's a post-workout.
[01:47:40.989 --> 01:47:44.689]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[01:47:45.029 --> 01:47:54.590]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[01:47:54.869 --> 01:48:01.470]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.

[01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:06.789]  This is beyond anything out there.

[01:48:23.399 --> 01:48:24.779]  So there's a line out the door.
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:33.260]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising and next time we're If I reproduce this or my sponsors do, we're gonna probably have to change the name.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.859]  And why is that?
[01:48:34.979 --> 01:48:35.560]  Well, it's simple.
[01:48:35.659 --> 01:48:39.520]  This is called Ultimate HydroForce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[01:48:39.819 --> 01:48:43.739]  But it's really a superfood post-workout, pre-workout.
[01:48:43.899 --> 01:48:47.600]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.

[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:14.399]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[01:49:14.659 --> 01:49:20.140]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country, and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.380]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.180]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're gonna come for us.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:31.579]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[01:49:31.739 --> 01:49:38.539]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:40.260]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:49:40.439 --> 01:49:43.380]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[01:49:43.579 --> 01:49:44.060]  Listen!
[01:49:44.359 --> 01:49:49.979]  I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[01:49:56.490 --> 01:50:01.229]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[01:50:08.210 --> 01:50:10.250]  Well, here we are back at the Infowars studios.
[01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:11.829]  I thought it was bought by The Onion.
[01:50:12.869 --> 01:50:15.250]  I heard they bought it or they got it at an auction.
[01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:17.170]  Turned out it was a rigged auction.
[01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:19.510]  Turned out the judge didn't authorize that auction.
[01:50:20.449 --> 01:50:25.949]  Turns out they colluded on the bids beforehand and not told the real people that came to bid.
[01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:31.609]  Turns out, people are really interested to find out what's going on.
[01:50:31.909 --> 01:50:44.909]  So, let it sink in, folks, that we're back at InfoWars, and the corporate media's got major egg on their face, and America's back, and Trump overrode the fraud, and the American people aren't your slaves.
[01:50:45.170 --> 01:50:53.029]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones, and in case they shut it down again, at AJNLive on X as well for the Alex Jones Network.
[01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:55.029]  God bless, and thank you all for your support.
[01:50:56.170 --> 01:51:11.210]  As almost everybody watching knows, today, while I'm shooting this announcement, November 13th, 2024, Infowars was up for sale at this big federal court-ordered bankruptcy auction.
[01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:14.510]  But then, a few days before the auction, they said it will no longer be public.
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:20.659]  And people can just put in one bid, and then we'll announce who the winner is, and it's all being kept secret.
[01:51:21.159 --> 01:51:25.039]  And then now, just a few minutes ago, we were told, well, we might tell you tomorrow or maybe in a week.
[01:51:25.159 --> 01:51:25.699]  Who knows?
[01:51:26.199 --> 01:51:28.659]  So everything about this case has been crazy.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:34.800]  The Democrats, the Justice Department have been caught involved filing the fake lawsuits, having the judges find us guilty.
[01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:43.289]  Having HBO there to shoot show trials, literally where the jury was told I was guilty, and when they were just there to decide how much money I owed people I did nothing to.
[01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:47.729]  So this has been one hell of a fight, but we're still on air at InfoWars.
[01:51:47.869 --> 01:52:02.130]  But regardless, our great sponsors at thealexjohnstore.com With incredible supplements and amazing Patriot gear have been helping us continue to stay on air and prepare to launch the Alex Jones Network, where we won't miss a beat.
[01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:16.890]  And if you remember when they first came on three months ago as a sponsor, they launched that incredible Super Dodge pickup giveaway sweepstakes, where every time you buy something at thealexjonesstore.com, you get entered to win the raffle for the truck.
[01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:21.090]  And the way those laws work is you have to wait a few weeks until any mail order entries come in.
[01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:22.449]  But that's going to get announced.
[01:52:22.590 --> 01:52:24.649]  The winner here in just a few days.
[01:52:24.829 --> 01:52:28.850]  And regardless of whether Infowars is on the air or not, the Alex Jones Network will be on air.
[01:52:28.949 --> 01:52:30.489]  And so you'll see the winner, the announcement.
[01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:32.329]  We're going to invite them to Austin and so much more.
[01:52:32.529 --> 01:52:33.430]  So now...
[01:52:33.829 --> 01:52:41.510]  We're going to do this in a few weeks, but now our great sponsor is doing it early because we're calling it the Darkest Hour Giveaway, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:41.890 --> 01:52:47.409]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:48.869]  I'll read over the specs in a moment.
[01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:50.010]  It's a beautiful truck.
[01:52:50.579 --> 01:52:55.939]  Super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
