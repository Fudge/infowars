[00:00:01.098 --> 00:00:06.901]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:21.610]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.111]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, August 16th, 2024.
[00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.012]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:34.318]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.443]  It's 80 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 33 seconds.
[00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:43.207]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:45.129]  You can cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:51.795]  Everyone can feel the danger that not just America, but the entire world is in.
[00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.037]  The globalist technocrats then
[00:00:55.034 --> 00:01:05.283]  Manipulate that anxiety and claim that it's nationalists and populists and capitalists and Christians, traditionalists that are to be blamed for the failure of civilization.
[00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:10.347]  But everything points back to the fight between good and evil.
[00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:14.271]  Thank you for joining us on this Live Friday transmission.
[00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.475]  Huge information we're going to be covering today and all the breaking news as well.
[00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.078]  Well, the Russia situation is huge.
[00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:26.744]  Russia ready to execute nuclear attacks on NATO targets according to leaked documents.
[00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.848]  They now admit NATO blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.809]  U.S.
[00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:38.119]  lying about involvement in the NATO attack into Russia proper with the ground troops in the Kursk.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.862]  Trump, of course, has now been vindicated that, indeed, Hunter Biden was being paid off by the Ukrainians and giving it to the big guy.
[00:01:47.742 --> 00:01:49.703]  All of that is so huge.
[00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:57.565]  And, of course, that global bombshell interview yesterday by former top Democrat strategist Naomi Wolf, where she said, look, we're already under the coup.
[00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:59.026]  They've installed Kamala.
[00:01:59.126 --> 00:01:59.846]  It's illegal.
[00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.127]  They're telling you they're going to have a civil war if Trump wins.
[00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:05.348]  We've got to get Trump
[00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:25.790]  To start talking about this more and you know he is to a certain extent he came out with Elon Musk and agreed that there was a coup over Biden and they basically took him out behind the barn and politically shot him or back behind the shed but this is really front and center
[00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:32.528]  And we'll put the show headline up, they're gaslighting everybody with these fake polls that Kamala's way ahead.
[00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:51.120]  When you actually drill into real scientific polls and individual issue polls, you have the vast majority of people, in one of these cases here, just unbelievable, 87% of voters see Kamala border disaster as an emergency or a major problem.
[00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.835]  But then she claims she's going to fix the border even though she's been in charge of it for almost four years.
[00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.555]  Just absolutely wild.
[00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.456]  And then, there's the headline right there, I'll put it back up.
[00:03:02.436 --> 00:03:11.677]  Desperate Harris Waltz campaign admits to using fake stories, thousands a day they flood, and polls, fake stories and polls, in an attempt to convince public she can win.
[00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:15.298]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:20.879]  And they are going to attempt to steal it yet again.
[00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:40.650]  They just charged one of the top Democrat election operatives in Houston for running around all over the county, all over the city, and getting rid of the ballots.
[00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.431]  So there wasn't enough ballots in Republican precincts.
[00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.692]  It's the same thing that they did in Phoenix.
[00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:56.820]  Where for the Democrat precincts, they printed out the right-length ballot and then created shrunken ones that were two and a half inches smaller that wouldn't feed, so the Republican votes got trashed.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.744]  I mean, it's just every dirty trick you can imagine.
[00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:15.194]  Everybody focuses on electronic machines, and there's some break-ins, there's some manipulation, they're very easily hackable, but that can be tracked, and you can see where somebody went and deleted it, so they've moved away from that as much.
[00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:23.449]  And it's even come out in court that these big companies, contrary to what they claimed in their fake lawsuits, are involved in a lot of manipulation.
[00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:33.252]  But the real theft is people voting for dead people and illegal aliens going out and voting in these blue cities where they're given a driver's license and put on the voter registration rolls.
[00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:35.413]  I mean, that's how they're doing it.
[00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:42.536]  And then trashing Republican ballots, creating fake ballots that don't work,
[00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:46.898]  When they feed them to the machines, I mean, it's just, it's, we know their tactics.
[00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.321]  And this time there's gonna be, now they're saying, over 300,000.
[00:04:51.872 --> 00:04:57.835]  Well, there's like 200,000, a few weeks ago, 300,000 poll watchers and folks watching all of this inside.
[00:04:57.855 --> 00:04:59.096]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:04.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, August 16th, 2024.
[00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:14.665]  I am your embattled host, coming to you from the battle-hardened studios of Infowars in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.067]  All right, I intend to open the phones up today.
[00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:25.844]  I intend to cover a massive amount of news and all the news that's breaking while we're on air ahead of the war room at three p.m.
[00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:28.566]  Central Standard Time today with the great Owen Schroer.
[00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.226]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:32.688]  Let me do this.
[00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.870]  Let me just give you the stacks.
[00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:42.693]  And again, one of these stacks I could do three, three, four hours on, but just let me just give me the stacks.
[00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:46.675]  And then we'll start drilling into it and I'm.
[00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:53.963]  I'm going to go with this Google Eric Schmidt news first, after I've mentioned what's coming up.
[00:05:56.685 --> 00:06:04.731]  We have Kamala Harris engaged in brazen fraud, as usual.
[00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:05.712]  People, the controller.
[00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:15.939]  So Trump said Monday, look for Kamala to start stealing
[00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:18.578]  Our economic plan.
[00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:31.008]  And he said on Musk Monday, he said, we played the clip here, he said, I almost want to wait until after the DNC in Chicago next week.
[00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:35.311]  So they've got to put their ideas out so they can't copy ours.
[00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:43.218]  So months after Trump came out with a plan for no tax on tips,
[00:06:44.724 --> 00:06:48.447]  Last week, she announced it, that she's going to have no tax on tips.
[00:06:50.288 --> 00:06:54.471]  And then I predicted they would then later claim it was actually always their policy, which they did two days later.
[00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:57.193]  I mean, it's just whatever the maximum lie is.
[00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:04.659]  But the maximum lie is not stealing Trump's no tax on tips plan or saying that's already their policy.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.961]  It's that
[00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:15.009]  They have been aggressive at targeting working-class people, and particularly folks that get tips, and they've admitted it.
[00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:23.355]  And she cast the time-breaking vote when she was vice president to get those 86,000 hoodlums hired.
[00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:26.237]  So this is just so cold-blooded.
[00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:28.940]  But that's not even the biggest deception.
[00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:35.545]  It's that you can bet your bottom Benjamin, or your bottom George Washington,
[00:07:36.766 --> 00:07:48.773]  Or your bottom Abraham Lincoln, your bottom $5 bill, that if they steal the election and get back in, you're not going to get no tax on tips.
[00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:54.237]  Now, another giant whopper proving Trump right, of course.
[00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:02.262]  Two days after JD Vance announces $5,000 tax credit, which of course they'll do,
[00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:16.079]  On every child you've got and some other big tax write-offs that are absolutely essential for working-class families, especially in this inflationary nightmare we're in, those taxes don't go to run the government, folks.
[00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:17.579]  The income tax came in in 1913.
[00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:18.880]  It's used to control people.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.701]  It's in the Communist Manifesto to have a graduated income tax.
[00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:25.702]  It's for social engineering.
[00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:32.465]  And so in Europe, they're pushing to tax people that have kids, the opposite of what Russia
[00:08:33.786 --> 00:08:35.307]  Not even China's doing what the U.S.
[00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:37.768]  is doing so we can get our numbers back up.
[00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:45.513]  But weeks into her campaign, Kamala Harris puts forward an economic agenda, and it's basically everything Trump says she's going to do.
[00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:50.476]  The difference is, with Kamala Harris, you're not going to get anything she says.
[00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:53.317]  You're going to get the opposite, other than totally open borders.
[00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:53.878]  She'll do that.
[00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.720]  So with Trump, he will do what he says he will do.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:15.445]  And he basically got everything through he wanted and basically did nothing but good stuff other than the idiotic warp speed that they hit him with and manipulated him into agreeing to it.
[00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:16.265]  And again, I've studied this.
[00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:17.265]  I'm not defending Trump.
[00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:18.346]  I'm mad at him about it still.
[00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.366]  But you heard him in that RFK Jr.
[00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:21.987]  leak clip two weeks ago.
[00:09:24.844 --> 00:09:26.605]  Well, I do think the shots are too big.
[00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:28.547]  It's like what you give a horse.
[00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:39.315]  Trump knows old-fashioned vaccines are actually vaccines that have a little bit of the virus in it, or a little of the bacteria that's dead now, or attenuated, so your body learns how to beat it.
[00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:40.696]  It can still have side effects.
[00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:41.557]  It can still be contaminated.
[00:09:41.577 --> 00:09:42.678]  It's still all sorts of problems.
[00:09:43.178 --> 00:09:45.320]  They've been caught spiking them with things to sterilize.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.101]  The UN has.
[00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:49.723]  But the new stuff they're putting in you,
[00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:51.812]  Is not a vaccine.
[00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:53.354]  That's why they had to change the definition.
[00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:59.201]  It is a mutagenic, self-replicating science, mad science experiment.
[00:10:01.003 --> 00:10:02.144]  You hear Trump behind the scenes.
[00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:07.530]  And of course, he wasn't for making people take it and all the rest of it.
[00:10:08.972 --> 00:10:10.033]  But that's still not good enough.
[00:10:10.454 --> 00:10:11.335]  He needs to come out against it.
[00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:20.531]  Trump also tried to get all the other therapies pushed through and he's also for the right to fight law that he got passed.
[00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:28.318]  Trump's the reason you can do all this online telemedicine now and it's lowered a lot of prices and get the drugs seniors and others need.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.921]  But that's why Trump did that.
[00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:36.725]  He just never could imagine that they would actually be jacking a shot to do this.
[00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:39.875]  I'm not defending him.
[00:10:39.895 --> 00:10:53.024]  The point is, is that he definitely will do what he says he's going to do, and when he says he's going to cut energy prices by half, that's a tall order because we're already so deep in inflation, but the U.S.
[00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:56.647]  has it and we can do it, and it will bring down inflation quite a bit.
[00:10:57.475 --> 00:11:06.520]  We've got the inflation numbers under Trump versus now, and it's staggeringly accelerated and worse under the Biden regime.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.961]  And we know that.
[00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.803]  And this whole Kamala claim that once she gets in, she'll fix everything.
[00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:16.085]  Trump had a press conference, as you know, yesterday and said, really, you've been there for three and a half years, lady.
[00:11:18.086 --> 00:11:20.588]  So we know what the Democrats are going to do.
[00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:22.209]  You've seen what they're going to do.
[00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:24.410]  Don't listen to what they say they're going to do.
[00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.271]  Listen and watch what they do.
[00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:29.912]  That's the old adage.
[00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:31.373]  Don't listen to what people say.
[00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:33.534]  Listen to what they do.
[00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:41.799]  And I know I'm overstating the obvious here, but can you imagine the idiocy of these people?
[00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.240]  In fact, there was a clip I was gonna play yesterday.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.322]  It's like a minute and a half long of a fella.
[00:11:46.342 --> 00:11:48.343]  He's got dark hair.
[00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:51.624]  And you guys can find the clip.
[00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:54.205]  And he's just like, it's like a minute and a half long.
[00:11:54.486 --> 00:11:56.187]  How stupid are these people?
[00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:58.248]  And he just sums it up like a minute and a half.
[00:11:58.268 --> 00:11:59.308]  He does a great job.
[00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:01.029]  I meant to play it, but I didn't.
[00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.391]  While we're finding that, do I want to play clip 14?
[00:12:06.673 --> 00:12:16.419]  And then back to back with clip 17, and then I'm going to move on to Vance and her trying to steal, she's not trying, stealing Trump's economic policies.
[00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:20.817]  Or taking credit for me, they've been doing both of that.
[00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:22.398]  But here's the poll.
[00:12:23.238 --> 00:12:26.460]  Almost 90% of people are super concerned about the border.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.822]  Well then how is it if she's the border czar, is she 5-10 points ahead of Trump?
[00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:34.124]  And then you go look at the polls, and the methodology's pure crap.
[00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:36.425]  So it is a fraud.
[00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:38.086]  They are publishing fake news stories.
[00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:43.750]  Run in newspapers, run on Google that look like a real article written by them.
[00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.290]  That's admitted.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.701]  And the media's like, well, that's legal.
[00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:50.342]  How ethical is that?
[00:12:52.322 --> 00:12:58.525]  Imagine if Trump could even get the news feeds to put fake news out.
[00:12:58.545 --> 00:12:59.125]  He wouldn't do that.
[00:12:59.725 --> 00:13:02.466]  But if he did, it'd be a huge scandal.
[00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:04.907]  But they do it and go, well, that's just what they do.
[00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:14.811]  You know, they just appoint Kamala, she didn't get one vote in the primaries, and they just say we're gonna have a civil war, and they just... We knew, a year ago, Biden killed the funding
[00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:21.388]  And then ordered the Border Patrol, even though they had another slush fund, to cease all the DNA testing on the border.
[00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:27.351]  Well, now we learn, going back three and a half years ago, that this came out in Congress in testimony Monday.
[00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.712]  I meant to play the clip, but it's like 10 minutes long.
[00:13:30.773 --> 00:13:35.936]  That they ordered them to stop it when Biden got into office.
[00:13:36.376 --> 00:13:41.539]  And so, they were supposed to test everybody if they don't have proper documentation.
[00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.280]  So, you have a guy show up with a baby.
[00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:49.482]  And you've stopped him three or four times last year and deported him, and he's got this baby, and he doesn't have an ID, and the baby doesn't have an ID.
[00:13:49.502 --> 00:13:50.643]  It's, you know, a one-year-old.
[00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.384]  These are real cases every day.
[00:13:53.805 --> 00:13:55.085]  And you go, who is this baby?
[00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:55.986]  Oh, this is my son.
[00:13:56.886 --> 00:13:57.627]  Where's his ID?
[00:13:57.707 --> 00:13:58.127]  Who is he?
[00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:02.270]  Okay, we're gonna DNA test you, and they can do a DNA test now within less than 24 hours.
[00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.270]  Very inexpensive.
[00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:12.936]  They can tell you this is the father, or this is an uncle, or this is a cousin, or this is a grandfather, and it can tell you how many people removed it is.
[00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:16.781]  And they test these guys, and there's no connection.
[00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:24.970]  You know, the test goes down so low, maybe, you know, they had some ancestor 100 years ago, so it says 20, you know, people removed.
[00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.052]  This person has some genetics, but it's not a family member.
[00:14:28.093 --> 00:14:28.994]  Not a 10th cousin.
[00:14:31.096 --> 00:14:32.518]  And then they go, buddy, this isn't your kid.
[00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:59.589]  But they get rid of that, so then they just bring them in, Catholic Charities, the Jewish Charity Group, they're the two big ones, I've videotaped it myself, so has the crew, they then just march them to the airport or to buses, and the same social worker woman, we watch her all day, go back and forth, and go, yes, this is my baby, here's my baby, and they'd say, okay, no paperwork, and just hand a baby, a six-month-old, to a woman, and we'd follow them through the x-rays, into the airport,
[00:15:02.085 --> 00:15:03.965]  And then you just see them getting on an airplane.
[00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:07.506]  Or they'd pull the airplanes up behind hangars.
[00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:08.206]  It was hard to get.
[00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:09.427]  We'd shoot to the fence and catch it.
[00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:15.468]  And you see all these people, social workers with babies, just loading onto these planes.
[00:15:16.568 --> 00:15:26.631]  And it was over a year and a half ago they had the Senate report where 89,000 children are completely missing and 400,000 they lost touch with.
[00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:34.545]  Now imagine the magnitude and the evil.
[00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:50.252]  And I've had top federal judges, high-level federal officers in meetings I've been in, who've reached out to me and said, you know, can you report on this stuff?
[00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:54.473]  And they gave us cases and things to look at as snapshots.
[00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:57.755]  One case was a guy that had been deported
[00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:02.532]  And convicted multiple times in other countries of molesting children.
[00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:12.096]  He was caught running the short bus in a South Texas town and molesting the mentally retarded children and autistic.
[00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:20.579]  And yeah, the woman we caught, I mean, she's there all the time on multiple trips, that just takes kids all day to the airport, her specialty is babies.
[00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:26.521]  She has a big old Grim Reaper mafia tattoo.
[00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:27.061]  Yeah, here she is.
[00:16:28.766 --> 00:16:32.707]  So this just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:34.268]  And this is just one of the times.
[00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:36.828]  We have other times where she's all by herself with the babies.
[00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:38.669]  Handing them off.
[00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.590]  And then she testifies, you know, oh, yes, this is my baby.
[00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.350]  I'm allowed to give it to you.
[00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.531]  Of course, it's not her baby.
[00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:48.572]  We've got so much footage of this.
[00:16:48.612 --> 00:16:49.812]  I've never even seen this footage.
[00:16:50.473 --> 00:16:51.933]  And there's the Grim Reaper on her leg.
[00:16:54.074 --> 00:16:56.074]  And you can tell what gang she's in specifically by it.
[00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:58.315]  Good job, crew, finding that so fast.
[00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:03.170]  So, I'm digressing here.
[00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.592]  Let's go ahead and play clip 14.
[00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:05.412]  Here it is.
[00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:08.915]  It's a big deal here, Dana.
[00:17:08.935 --> 00:17:10.177]  44% believe it's an emergency.
[00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:12.739]  43% believe it's a major problem.
[00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:17.403]  That's 87% of the people we surveyed just this past week.
[00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:22.908]  That's a big number and it shows you why immigration is such a leading issue on this campaign.
[00:17:22.948 --> 00:17:24.069]  Then we ask this question.
[00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.151]  You know, who do you trust to do a better job?
[00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:28.153]  This is clearly in Trump's column.
[00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:33.136]  58-39 on border security, 56-42 on immigration.
[00:17:33.716 --> 00:17:39.500]  It is going to be very difficult for Kamala Harris over the next 80 some odd days to change these numbers.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.002]  Trump controls this issue.
[00:17:42.182 --> 00:17:42.902]  He owns it.
[00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:51.588]  Based on his reputation and based on his time as a first-termer and also based on some of the comments we just heard like that clip from Kamala Harris in 2019.
[00:17:51.648 --> 00:17:53.109]  She has changed her position.
[00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:54.990]  We'll see whether or not voters buy that.
[00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.912]  As borders are, she allowed 20 million people, and I believe it's higher than that.
[00:17:59.972 --> 00:18:04.734]  People say 13, 14, 12, 10, but now they're all up to around 12, 13, 14.
[00:18:05.154 --> 00:18:10.216]  They have no idea because you have millions and millions of what they call gataways, the gataways.
[00:18:11.116 --> 00:18:12.977]  Gataways are people that pour into our country.
[00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:14.237]  We have no idea who they are.
[00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:15.598]  That's the worst of all.
[00:18:16.383 --> 00:18:30.971]  But she allowed at least 20 million people to invade our country, and she wants to give them all citizenship and free government healthcare, and let them raid Medicare and Social Security, which will, again, she will destroy Medicare, she will destroy Social Security.
[00:18:32.752 --> 00:18:35.254]  That's the plan, wreck the country, Cloud and Piven, again.
[00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:40.317]  They don't want price controls, because they really think it's going to lower prices.
[00:18:40.457 --> 00:18:41.658]  It always does the opposite.
[00:18:42.918 --> 00:18:43.679]  Within about a month.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.361]  And then everything just goes cattywampus.
[00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:56.422]  And everybody knows this, I guess we have some new Democrat listeners, but it's been done hundreds of times in the last century around the world.
[00:18:56.442 --> 00:19:00.603]  It's been done here, it's been done in Venezuela, it's been done in Germany, it's been done everywhere.
[00:19:01.663 --> 00:19:13.866]  And at first, prices lowered, and then all of a sudden, the stuff's not available anymore, because people can't produce it, and quality goes down, and there's shortages, and then what happens with the shortages, prices go up even higher.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.181]  So you want to wreck an economy, that's what you do.
[00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:19.043]  And I know for listeners, you're like, Jones, we know that.
[00:19:19.503 --> 00:19:21.705]  We have a lot of new Democrats and dum-dums tuning in.
[00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.525]  I'm really serious.
[00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:23.466]  I'm not being condescending.
[00:19:24.346 --> 00:19:26.088]  Don't understand this, okay?
[00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:28.449]  It's a fact of economics.
[00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.190]  It's a law of it.
[00:19:31.832 --> 00:19:36.295]  If there's less of something, because it's not being produced, what happens to it if it's in demand?
[00:19:36.335 --> 00:19:36.935]  It explodes.
[00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:37.475]  Okay.
[00:19:38.997 --> 00:19:42.339]  Here's Trump on Kamala and what she's planning to do at the border.
[00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:53.963]  She wants to end detention of illegal alien migrants, releasing vicious monsters into our communities to rape, maim, and murder our population.
[00:19:54.544 --> 00:19:57.805]  She endorsed the funding of the police and no cash bail nationwide.
[00:19:57.845 --> 00:19:59.326]  She was the original no-funder.
[00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:06.826]  And the only thing Kamala Harris can deliver is horrific inflation, massive crime, and the death of the American Dream.
[00:20:06.846 --> 00:20:14.450]  She is in favor of the death of the American Dream because everything she does really stops, any one of these items, stops the American Dream.
[00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.392]  We want our youth to go back and dream of being successful.
[00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:23.535]  And here's Trump on MS-13, the Nancy Pelosi Center, all God's children.
[00:20:24.876 --> 00:20:29.078]  And when I first came into office, you know the story that President Obama at the time,
[00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:31.418]  Had no way of getting them back.
[00:20:31.718 --> 00:20:37.500]  And I said, I want to get all of the MS-13 in particular out of our country, bring them back to where they came from.
[00:20:38.301 --> 00:20:40.342]  A general said, sir, that won't be possible.
[00:20:40.382 --> 00:20:40.642]  Why?
[00:20:40.682 --> 00:20:43.923]  Because they blocked the airports, they blocked the roads, they blocked everything.
[00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:44.564]  You can't do it.
[00:20:45.684 --> 00:20:47.585]  I said, so they're making a concerted effort?
[00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:48.205]  Yes, sir.
[00:20:48.265 --> 00:20:49.586]  They're making a concerted effort.
[00:20:49.606 --> 00:20:50.286]  We can't do it.
[00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:53.148]  They put planes on the runway so we can't land the plane, sir.
[00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:55.457]  And the same thing with the roads.
[00:20:55.477 --> 00:20:56.517]  They block up the roads.
[00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:59.658]  So if we have buses coming in, they block up the roads.
[00:20:59.678 --> 00:21:01.399]  They're totally blocked and they're terrible.
[00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:05.041]  It's been that way for years, sir, all the way back to Bush.
[00:21:05.781 --> 00:21:07.242]  It's been that way for years.
[00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:13.264]  And I said, well, how much do we pay them in terms of economic development and aid?
[00:21:13.925 --> 00:21:16.566]  Sure, we pay them $750 million.
[00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.166]  I said, that's okay.
[00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:21.548]  Call them immediately and tell them we're not paying them anymore.
[00:21:23.764 --> 00:21:25.945]  And he's talking about a specific Latin American country.
[00:21:25.965 --> 00:21:26.646]  He got on the line.
[00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:31.489]  Mexico's giving billions and Trump called up and one day they stopped and he goes, okay, well, let's not give you the money.
[00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:37.252]  And it's the same thing, again, when France wouldn't take any appliances from the United States.
[00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:39.113]  They were simply illegally blocking it.
[00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:42.555]  Trump said, that's fine, we're gonna put a 100% tariff on all wine.
[00:21:43.956 --> 00:21:45.036]  All wine from France.
[00:21:45.617 --> 00:21:47.878]  Macron called back in three minutes and said, deal.
[00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:50.920]  Ship your washing machines in.
[00:21:52.782 --> 00:21:54.964]  So again, we've not been open for business.
[00:21:55.505 --> 00:21:56.846]  They've had a boot on our neck.
[00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:58.167]  Trump will take it off.
[00:21:59.088 --> 00:22:04.032]  They've given how many hundreds of billions in subsidies to the electric car makers.
[00:22:05.494 --> 00:22:09.698]  And Trump said, you move to Mexico, I'll put 100% tariff on you.
[00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:12.660]  I mean, that's what you use tariffs for.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.225]  You don't just throw up big tariffs against other countries because you're being mean to them.
[00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:20.127]  You do it when they're screwing you.
[00:22:20.868 --> 00:22:24.371]  Now, if a country does a fair exchange and wants to just do straight trade, we do that.
[00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:28.034]  But you do it... bilaterally.
[00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:30.175]  Multilaterally.
[00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:42.465]  You don't just... You don't just sit there and go, oh, for everybody, Omni... Just, we're just wide open, and then that special middleman get all the money.
[00:22:43.126 --> 00:22:44.467]  Remember Trump discovered that about China.
[00:22:48.018 --> 00:22:49.940]  He gave speeches on it, and it's true.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:11.418]  It's how it's worked since China got opened up, really in the 80s, but accelerated the 90s under the Clintons, where these middlemen go over there, and they don't let our stuff in, but special companies and middlemen like Charlie Munger and Berkshire Hathaways, you know, right at the top of it, they really own the biggest piece of black rock.
[00:23:11.438 --> 00:23:13.260]  Of course, I'm talking about Warren Buffett.
[00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:15.482]  And they discovered
[00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:24.756]  That China was getting 25% of the money in their economy, the U.S.
[00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:36.664]  was getting about 25%, or 30%, and 40-plus percent, on average, was going to the middlemen companies that didn't even ever touch the product.
[00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:38.846]  They just have the deal.
[00:23:40.282 --> 00:23:48.088]  That the globalists set up with China that we'll put regulations and basically internal tariffs on our goods against our country, which is insane.
[00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.574]  So it's really a tariff against our goods to the world, so everybody has to buy yours.
[00:23:56.575 --> 00:24:03.841]  And we'll harass every mine and every domestic company that operates internationally, the entire Western world from Australia to
[00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:05.524]  We're good to go.
[00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.241]  Silver mines shut down.
[00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:29.303]  And then you ask, how does China have 97... Last time I checked, 97.8.
[00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:33.805]  Guys, look, because it's changed a little because Trump kind of reversed some of it, but not much.
[00:24:34.405 --> 00:24:34.745]  Look up.
[00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:39.046]  China's share of rare earth mineral extraction.
[00:24:39.727 --> 00:24:43.048]  Or just type in, China controls 97% of rare earth minerals.
[00:24:43.268 --> 00:24:45.529]  And you'll get a year where it was 97, but it's right up there at almost 100.
[00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:45.829]  97% control.
[00:24:51.345 --> 00:24:53.289]  Conservatively, of all rare earth minerals.
[00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:55.212]  Lithium, you know, there's hundreds of things.
[00:24:56.635 --> 00:24:59.120]  That is strategically done to shut us down.
[00:24:59.983 --> 00:25:06.086]  So, it's, and I went on this rant because it's strategic to do price fixing to screw things worse.
[00:25:06.446 --> 00:25:09.528]  It's strategic to shut down the oil drilling and gas drilling permits.
[00:25:09.868 --> 00:25:12.869]  It's strategic to drain the strategic oil reserve.
[00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:20.213]  It is strategic to kill the Keystone Pipeline and hundreds of others, thousands of small ones, where they just don't authorize permits.
[00:25:20.233 --> 00:25:26.756]  You know, there are lots of 30, 40, 50, 60 year old pipelines to gas fields all over this country.
[00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:38.794]  And we've got property in East Texas where we don't get a lot of money for it, but my dad gets a little bit from my uncle and other family when they, you know, because they're running a gas pipeline across your property.
[00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:44.158]  Deals set 50 years ago where you get a little check in the mail because they're using your property.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:51.545]  Well, for the last decade, they needed to replace these, but they couldn't even get the permits in most cases under Obama.
[00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:57.788]  And now under Biden, I talk to these oil field workers and gas workers, and I see it in the news.
[00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:00.489]  I see it in industry news, energy news.
[00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:08.814]  So now, again, Trump took all those controls off, and so we went from the third biggest exporter and producer to number one.
[00:26:09.374 --> 00:26:09.795]  Overnight.
[00:26:10.575 --> 00:26:11.936]  And I know most of the audience gets this.
[00:26:11.976 --> 00:26:15.338]  Again, I'm always talking to the dumbos out there, because I really care about them.
[00:26:16.738 --> 00:26:22.600]  China currently produces around 60% of the world's rare earth minerals and its origin of around 90%.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.261]  Yeah, it's the origin.
[00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:26.081]  So see, it's just from Trump.
[00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:27.482]  They never got it back.
[00:26:28.242 --> 00:26:29.863]  But up until Trump got in, they had 97 and 98.
[00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:36.865]  Now they control the origin of 90% of refined rare earth minerals on the market.
[00:26:37.185 --> 00:26:37.905]  Now that's Google.
[00:26:37.945 --> 00:26:40.246]  That's politico.eu.
[00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:41.667]  I don't think it's dropped to 90.
[00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:45.208]  But there you go.
[00:26:46.627 --> 00:26:48.088]  So, and that's Reuters.
[00:26:48.388 --> 00:26:50.390]  How dominant is China in the rarest mineral supply?
[00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.652]  And that's why Elon Musk's been going down to South America trying to make deals.
[00:26:53.993 --> 00:26:55.454]  They're like, oh, he's muscling in.
[00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:57.856]  He wants to be a dictator.
[00:26:58.576 --> 00:27:00.618]  He's going to overthrow us.
[00:27:00.678 --> 00:27:02.959]  No, he wants to come in and get the minerals.
[00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:05.882]  All right, I'm ranting.
[00:27:06.862 --> 00:27:14.949]  I'm going to come back here and shift gears into what I said I would do as my top story, but I kind of digressed.
[00:27:15.974 --> 00:27:19.756]  Wait till you see this Google information.
[00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:23.018]  This is just so massive.
[00:27:24.438 --> 00:27:26.559]  Dealing with combat AI robots.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.180]  This is the biggest development yet.
[00:27:29.001 --> 00:27:29.681]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:29.801 --> 00:27:30.762]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:27:31.562 --> 00:27:32.442]  Nitric boost.
[00:27:33.363 --> 00:27:33.863]  Turmeric 95.
[00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:39.021]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[00:27:39.982 --> 00:27:44.967]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:52.634]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[00:27:53.175 --> 00:27:55.157]  They let us private label their products.
[00:27:55.177 --> 00:27:56.057]  That's why you've already heard of
[00:27:56.918 --> 00:27:57.980]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.043]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[00:28:01.284 --> 00:28:02.605]  This is just their brand of that.
[00:28:02.946 --> 00:28:06.230]  And so it is available under Turmeric 95.
[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.251]  That's the name.
[00:28:07.512 --> 00:28:13.179]  So we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:16.742]  Alright my friends, I'm going to cover a subject that is as important as any other
[00:28:40.373 --> 00:28:44.037]  Cultural, political, economic, technological development in our world.
[00:28:44.917 --> 00:28:47.420]  Now, I myself am not an electrical engineer.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.985]  I myself do not get into the details of the hardware.
[00:28:54.247 --> 00:28:59.532]  But I do constantly, for 35 years, 30 on air, talk to the leading experts.
[00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:02.715]  And I read the trade publications.
[00:29:06.838 --> 00:29:10.961]  Not so much the pop tech news, which I read that as well.
[00:29:13.383 --> 00:29:17.326]  But that's how I knew about their plans with AI 30 years ago.
[00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:19.728]  People find clips from 30 years ago and it's dead on.
[00:29:20.829 --> 00:29:33.338]  Well, it's because, theoretically, technology's built to a certain point even 30 years ago that these engineers and others can really project very accurately
[00:29:34.443 --> 00:29:38.586]  What they're going to have at the current growth rate of the technology.
[00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:40.287]  And Elon Musk has talked a lot about this.
[00:29:42.589 --> 00:29:59.420]  And so, when you see movies like Terminator, and the remakes in the 90s, and you look at those drones, the little drones flying around killing people, and you look today, the drones look exactly like that.
[00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:02.522]  And you ask, well how did they nail it perfectly?
[00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:13.678]  It's because they'd already tested a lot of this, and they'd already theoretically developed a lot of these systems, but what they need to do is get the cost down.
[00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:32.963]  Now again, even my grandfather, my mom's dad, who was an inventor and a World War II vet, and he never got filthy rich as an inventor, but he grew up in Dallas next door to a very famous inventor who was one of the main patent holders on freezers.
[00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:38.317]  For specifically industrial-level rail cars and things, but that's a side issue.
[00:30:39.178 --> 00:30:40.118]  I've told that story before.
[00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:54.346]  In the mid-60s to late-60s, he built radio-controlled robots that were highly classified, actually out at Bergstrom Air Force Bases where they had the lab.
[00:30:55.407 --> 00:30:58.949]  And he just had government grants, because back then the government gave grants to little inventors.
[00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:03.763]  That's like the Barrett 50 Cal got invented, what, in Tennessee in a guy's garage.
[00:31:03.783 --> 00:31:06.525]  You know, that was, so, so, used to, that's where all the stuff came from.
[00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:08.506]  Now it's these big giant facilities.
[00:31:08.546 --> 00:31:12.709]  That's what Eisenhower in their early 60s was warning of, was how it was centralizing.
[00:31:12.729 --> 00:31:15.171]  But, but, here I am giving you too much background.
[00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:16.051]  Let me cut right to the chase.
[00:31:19.674 --> 00:31:27.119]  The holy grail of this, the entire time,
[00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:28.745]  We're good to go.
[00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:59.488]  And the infrastructures in the world to make humans be completely removed from the process.
[00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:08.171]  And, you know, you see General Milley coming out and saying, yeah, we're going to replace a third of the military in the next few years and probably half of it after that.
[00:32:08.451 --> 00:32:10.092]  No, they intend to get rid of all of it.
[00:32:11.532 --> 00:32:13.093]  And so there's an arms race of this.
[00:32:15.494 --> 00:32:19.595]  And they show you the robot dogs and the humanoid robots and people think that's scary.
[00:32:20.975 --> 00:32:22.476]  But what's really important
[00:32:24.534 --> 00:32:26.116]  Yeah, robots, flamethrowers.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:37.186]  The AI in all the computer systems, in the dams, in the satellites, in the telecommunications, that's the real power to turn the lights off.
[00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:43.092]  Or take control of all the electric cars, if you want, and use them as weapons to crash into things.
[00:32:46.995 --> 00:32:48.397]  But what they're really moving ahead with
[00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:53.662]  And an Israeli company already had this 15 years ago.
[00:32:53.742 --> 00:33:10.757]  We showed their actual weapons ad off Google, where it showed a C-130 flying over, and a hundred of these little drones fall out that have little wings, and they've got cameras on them, and then they've got a little rifle, and then they go and kill people.
[00:33:11.378 --> 00:33:14.941]  Well, that's 15 years ago what they're showing you, so imagine it's way more advanced than that.
[00:33:16.642 --> 00:33:16.903]  Then,
[00:33:18.476 --> 00:33:38.759]  They come out with new systems where a plane flies over and drops out a thousand little tiny marbles that have little little wings on them and they just simply fly up to a human, land on them,
[00:33:39.793 --> 00:33:43.515]  And have a tiny little needle that just injects you with cyanide.
[00:33:44.075 --> 00:33:49.637]  Or there's a tiny charge and it flies right up your face, blows up, you get hit with cyanide.
[00:33:50.238 --> 00:33:55.720]  And that's just some of the stuff they admit has been developed and that it's been declassified.
[00:33:57.361 --> 00:33:59.342]  They just haven't deployed it that we don't know of.
[00:34:00.502 --> 00:34:03.944]  And they haven't shown it to you.
[00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:12.557]  Just like 30 years ago, they had part goat, part spider creatures at military bases all over the U.S.
[00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:15.940]  producing body armor for a secret project that went back to the 50s.
[00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:19.604]  And people are like, wow, or back 50 years, excuse me, back to the 70s.
[00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.991]  And so imagine the stuff they already had.
[00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:32.052]  People wouldn't believe me 30 years ago when I was reading out of public stuff.
[00:34:32.973 --> 00:34:36.214]  But because it wasn't on the nightly news, they're like, oh, that's movies, Alex.
[00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:45.136]  So you see something like Terminator, especially the remakes of the 90s, and it's the exact weapons, basically.
[00:34:45.156 --> 00:34:48.897]  That's because they already had them.
[00:34:51.538 --> 00:34:52.478]  You're just seeing
[00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:56.097]  To the consumers, the crappy stuff being deployed.
[00:34:57.818 --> 00:35:01.941]  And then that funds the industry further and builds more factories, more infrastructure, expanded.
[00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.103]  And now they're building hundreds of billions of dollars of data centers everywhere.
[00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:10.367]  Oh, there's no problem, you know, for them in the environment.
[00:35:10.427 --> 00:35:11.768]  You just, your farming's bad.
[00:35:12.488 --> 00:35:13.469]  Your milk cows are bad.
[00:35:13.489 --> 00:35:14.850]  Your cow farting is bad.
[00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:21.895]  But oh, giant data centers spying on you to make AI faster and faster, to make us obsolete.
[00:35:22.315 --> 00:35:23.016]  Those are just fine.
[00:35:25.327 --> 00:35:27.869]  So they need a military that will follow orders.
[00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:35.977]  But in the end, it's not going to be militaries in general that are going to come attack us with robot armies.
[00:35:36.017 --> 00:35:37.158]  That certainly is going to be done.
[00:35:37.178 --> 00:35:41.782]  It's already happening in the Middle East with AI running the attacks on Gaza.
[00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:43.523]  It's already happening in the Russia-Ukraine war.
[00:35:44.704 --> 00:35:48.508]  But the real military attack is replacing your job.
[00:35:49.551 --> 00:36:00.082]  The real military attack is shutting down all the normal human industry and forcing through BlackRock control with investment of these poisonous, toxic systems that are anti-human.
[00:36:00.122 --> 00:36:00.902]  You will eat the bugs.
[00:36:02.564 --> 00:36:07.909]  I'm sorry, you can't have your own car, but you can have a rideshare if you've got the right credits and it's a self-driving car.
[00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.293]  So it's not that any technology in and of itself is bad.
[00:36:13.131 --> 00:36:21.254]  You're a quadriplegic, but you, before you, you know, you have some money in the bank because you own a business, but, but, you know, now, now, now you can't really drive yourself.
[00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:22.894]  So you've got a self-driving car.
[00:36:22.954 --> 00:36:25.235]  You've got a self-driving wheelchair.
[00:36:25.335 --> 00:36:26.175]  It loads into the car.
[00:36:26.195 --> 00:36:26.916]  It takes where you want to go.
[00:36:28.296 --> 00:36:29.757]  That's a good thing for self-driving.
[00:36:30.357 --> 00:36:35.398]  But see, for most people, you don't want that because again, it's meant to replace you and make you obsolete.
[00:36:36.919 --> 00:36:38.139]  So now let's move on to the big story.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.661]  And it would take hours to go over this guy, but Eric Schmidt,
[00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:52.867]  of Google is as bad as it gets.
[00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:05.935]  And he always tells you that he's a loving, wonderful liberal.
[00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:09.338]  And everything he's doing is to fight evil.
[00:37:09.398 --> 00:37:10.598]  And he's so wonderful.
[00:37:10.638 --> 00:37:12.780]  And remember Google's motto, don't be evil.
[00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:16.202]  And then 10 years ago, they just got rid of it, or 8 years ago.
[00:37:18.023 --> 00:37:36.294]  So, Google has always been a Pentagon CIA NSA project to roll out NSA technology to the public, starting in 1998, so the public would opt in to a private NSA interface.
[00:37:36.974 --> 00:37:39.656]  And that's in their founding documents, with In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:37:41.197 --> 00:37:42.778]  And they claimed, oh, it was started in a
[00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:49.900]  In a garage, and these young kids came up with it, and all of that is just a front story.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.861]  All of that, it's come out, it's just, it's even in mainstream news, it's just total bull.
[00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:55.662]  Just like Facebook.
[00:37:55.922 --> 00:38:00.563]  The day Facebook launches, the CIA's version of it gets deleted.
[00:38:00.603 --> 00:38:01.443]  And it's the same thing.
[00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:05.044]  So, so, so, it's a Trojan horse.
[00:38:08.188 --> 00:38:10.930]  And of course, Schmidt and all the big tech companies, who are they for?
[00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:11.851]  They're for the globalists.
[00:38:11.871 --> 00:38:12.512]  They're for the left.
[00:38:12.532 --> 00:38:13.793]  They're for consolidating control.
[00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:16.135]  But they're not real liberals at the end of the day.
[00:38:16.175 --> 00:38:16.916]  They love war.
[00:38:16.956 --> 00:38:17.636]  They love tyranny.
[00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:18.998]  They love dehumanization.
[00:38:19.218 --> 00:38:20.259]  They fund Black Lives Matter.
[00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:21.420]  They fund the trans movement.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.246]  Because they want to train humans to give up their humanity, because this is an AI takeover of the species, and that's Google's admitted plan.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:37.706]  So now ex-Google CEO turned licensed arm dealer Eric Schmidt creating powerful AI robotic war machines for offensive fighting.
[00:38:37.826 --> 00:38:38.366]  That's a quote.
[00:38:38.386 --> 00:38:49.453]  And he goes and speaks at Stanford and all the other big top MIT AI and robotic research facilities that they're financing through his dozens of companies.
[00:38:51.855 --> 00:38:57.379]  And he gets up last week and he goes, I just became an arms dealer a month ago.
[00:38:59.409 --> 00:39:12.833]  Because I'm mad about Russia, and I want to deploy AI, autonomous killer robots, over there, and we are deploying it, and it's all legal, it's all good, and the liberals are all, eh, we have it, the engineers.
[00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:19.015]  Because remember, Google, quote, wouldn't give the Pentagon their AI.
[00:39:20.043 --> 00:39:20.843]  But they really were.
[00:39:21.143 --> 00:39:25.305]  This is so Google can still be in China and everywhere else and be spying on everything.
[00:39:25.605 --> 00:39:27.266]  They want to act like there's a split in Google.
[00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:30.387]  But, oh, Schmitt, he doesn't like the military.
[00:39:30.427 --> 00:39:30.867]  He's a liberal.
[00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:32.968]  Schmitt's always been a military engineer.
[00:39:35.889 --> 00:39:40.830]  Schmitt has gone around and bought up most of the robotics companies for the Pentagon to integrate it together.
[00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:48.153]  Schmitt's been working for decades before he even took over at Google in building combat robots.
[00:39:49.258 --> 00:39:52.721]  But now he comes out and he goes, oh, I just got an idea!
[00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:56.064]  AI-run hunter-killer robots to fight the Russians!
[00:39:56.805 --> 00:39:57.845]  And then he says the key.
[00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:01.969]  He says, and everything he says is a lie.
[00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.254]  He says, in warfare, it's much easier to attack than to defend.
[00:40:08.014 --> 00:40:14.180]  So we've got to have giant armies of combat robots stationed everywhere so the Russians don't get us.
[00:40:16.874 --> 00:40:21.217]  So here he is, literally rolling out, deploying, with the police departments and everywhere.
[00:40:21.397 --> 00:40:23.499]  Now they don't dispatch police to your house, a drone comes first.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.521]  And police need to resist this.
[00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:29.063]  It's okay to have some robots, but you have to be in total control of them.
[00:40:29.243 --> 00:40:34.567]  And they can't be run and connected to Skynet, or the globalists, anytime they want to flip a switch, and all those robots serve them.
[00:40:36.388 --> 00:40:45.655]  Now, number one, he gives out this theory of land warfare, and he says, it's tanks, artillery, mortars, troops.
[00:40:47.196 --> 00:40:58.726]  Well, anybody that actually studies military history and current systems knows, you've got to have 3 to 1 superiority to be sure you're going to win in an offensive action.
[00:41:00.748 --> 00:41:06.313]  Offensive attacks are the most dangerous, whether it was Santa Ana with 5,000 troops against 180.
[00:41:06.413 --> 00:41:10.957]  Why were 180 able to kill thousands of the Mexican troops?
[00:41:10.978 --> 00:41:12.119]  The Mexican troops weren't pussies.
[00:41:13.583 --> 00:41:18.427]  They were having to go in and try to fight and get over walls from heavily defended positions.
[00:41:18.828 --> 00:41:20.809]  So it was that way 180 years ago.
[00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:27.014]  Or however long ago it was, 1836.
[00:41:28.595 --> 00:41:29.776]  And it's the same today.
[00:41:30.417 --> 00:41:33.259]  Go look up current military theory.
[00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:35.661]  3 to 1 to attack.
[00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:40.825]  Now you can say the best defense is a good offense if you've got nukes or something or you take out your enemy first.
[00:41:41.246 --> 00:41:41.986]  But that's different.
[00:41:42.086 --> 00:41:42.687]  That's strategic.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:54.345]  So, he gets up there and goes, oh, because it's so easy to attack someone, we've got to have robots stationed everywhere.
[00:41:55.426 --> 00:41:57.828]  But that's the globalist Trojan horse.
[00:41:57.868 --> 00:41:58.908]  That's their army.
[00:41:58.968 --> 00:42:00.049]  That's their forces.
[00:42:00.089 --> 00:42:01.169]  That's their system.
[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.673]  And again, looking at the physical drone or combat robot, that is a small
[00:42:08.015 --> 00:42:10.457]  Force they need if somebody's dug in and resisting.
[00:42:10.777 --> 00:42:12.779]  They've already got you because they took your farm over.
[00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:14.100]  They already cut your energy off.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.180]  They already got rid of your job.
[00:42:15.421 --> 00:42:16.681]  They already brainwashed your kids.
[00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.643]  They already drugged your wife up, your husband up.
[00:42:20.424 --> 00:42:21.885]  These guys mean business.
[00:42:21.905 --> 00:42:33.174]  That's why I confronted Sundar Pichai, the head of Google, that replaced Schmidt, a few years ago, in congressional hearings about me and others, where he's there lying in the hearings, and I said, Google is evil.
[00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:37.357]  Because they are.
[00:42:39.565 --> 00:42:47.127]  We'll get to that in a moment, but let's go to Schmidt because, again, I've tracked him a lot over the years, but when I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:55.968]  this morning and I saw this story on Infowars.com that had just been posted, I went, let me look into what he's doing currently.
[00:42:56.068 --> 00:42:59.989]  And man, the scandals he's involved in right now, the scams of this guy.
[00:43:00.669 --> 00:43:03.490]  I mean, this guy's Lex Luthor, okay?
[00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.931]  He's at Stanford teaching them how to steal everybody's software and repurpose it.
[00:43:10.256 --> 00:43:12.817]  And as long as you sell to the government to create a monopoly, it's okay?
[00:43:13.818 --> 00:43:15.779]  He's telling kids how to insider trade?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.281]  I've got articles right here.
[00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:21.222]  I mean, he's teaching an army of crooks.
[00:43:21.322 --> 00:43:21.943]  That's what they are.
[00:43:22.803 --> 00:43:26.245]  And they wear pink sweaters and have green socks and go, oh, we're liberal!
[00:43:26.425 --> 00:43:27.306]  Oh, look!
[00:43:27.326 --> 00:43:27.366]  Oh!
[00:43:27.926 --> 00:43:29.227]  You know, oh, I'm a liberal!
[00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:30.768]  That's all a cover.
[00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.828]  That's camouflage.
[00:43:32.028 --> 00:43:35.750]  Because you think if Darth Vader comes walking through the door, you're like, oh, there's the bad guy.
[00:43:36.371 --> 00:43:38.352]  But if it's Bill Gates in a pink sweater,
[00:43:40.865 --> 00:43:45.787]  And they're saying, yeah, we need robots stationed everywhere for the Russians.
[00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.868]  It's so easy for the Russians to take us over.
[00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:51.949]  The Russians are coming with 5 million troops in an open attack.
[00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:54.270]  If Americans would unify, they'd all get killed.
[00:43:56.471 --> 00:43:58.752]  Just like Hitler trying to go into Russia, same thing happened.
[00:44:01.273 --> 00:44:02.753]  That's a load of BS.
[00:44:04.714 --> 00:44:10.056]  Look how hard it is for Ukraine with all the NATO weapons to even get a few miles into Russia, and vice versa.
[00:44:12.145 --> 00:44:13.225]  Trench Warfare is back.
[00:44:15.806 --> 00:44:20.088]  So, Schmidt is just such a massive liar on every front.
[00:44:20.948 --> 00:44:25.009]  And Google's been spying and rigging and running a monopoly the whole time.
[00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:32.652]  And it's already metastasized out through Alphabet into hundreds and hundreds of other companies and subsidiaries.
[00:44:32.672 --> 00:44:34.913]  And they've already moved on to the next big scams they're running.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.362]  And they've got everybody obsessed on, you know, Google's search monopoly.
[00:44:40.382 --> 00:44:41.343]  And it's a total monopoly.
[00:44:41.543 --> 00:44:43.324]  Not just a search monopoly, they're giving you fake results.
[00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:43.844]  They're lying to you.
[00:44:43.864 --> 00:44:46.385]  They're giving you fake Kamala stories and fake polls.
[00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:50.768]  And sending out voter reminders to Democrats, but not to Republicans.
[00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.349]  And they're reading your email.
[00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:57.052]  If you use Google Forms or Google Questionnaires, you know, your psychologist, your doctor.
[00:44:57.312 --> 00:44:58.432]  You know, Google reads it all.
[00:44:58.452 --> 00:44:59.313]  They admittedly do it.
[00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:02.034]  They don't care about HIPAA because they're the CIA.
[00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:16.361]  So, here he is going, oh, we're so liberal, oh, we need combat robots stationed everywhere so that no one dare attack us because the robots will protect us.
[00:45:16.661 --> 00:45:18.522]  Yeah, who runs the robots?
[00:45:18.862 --> 00:45:19.483]  These people.
[00:45:20.964 --> 00:45:22.064]  Russia's not the threat.
[00:45:23.245 --> 00:45:24.906]  It's big tech, it's the globalists.
[00:45:26.327 --> 00:45:27.008]  Go ahead and roll the clip.
[00:45:28.428 --> 00:45:35.013]  Watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment buildings with little old ladies and kids just drove me crazy.
[00:45:35.876 --> 00:45:43.052]  So I decided to work on a company with your friend, Sebastian Thrun, as a former faculty member here, and a whole bunch of Stanford people.
[00:45:44.249 --> 00:45:47.672]  And the idea basically is to do two things.
[00:45:48.133 --> 00:45:52.136]  Use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic war.
[00:45:52.857 --> 00:45:55.219]  And the second one is to lower the cost of the robots.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.423]  Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal like me do that?
[00:45:59.984 --> 00:46:06.310]  And the answer is that the whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries, and mortar.
[00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.492]  And we can eliminate all of them.
[00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:15.254]  And we can make the penalty for invading a country, at least by land, essentially be impossible.
[00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:17.976]  It should eliminate the kind of land battles.
[00:46:18.116 --> 00:46:19.938]  Well, this is a really interesting question.
[00:46:20.398 --> 00:46:23.160]  Does it give more of an advantage to defense versus offense?
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.322]  Can you even make that distinction?
[00:46:25.362 --> 00:46:29.665]  Because I've been doing this for the last year, I've learned a lot about war that I really did not want to know.
[00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:38.533]  And one of the things to know about war is that the offense always has the advantage because you can always overwhelm the defensive systems.
[00:46:39.522 --> 00:46:46.405]  And so you're better off as a strategy of national defense to have a very strong offense that you can use if you need to.
[00:46:46.425 --> 00:46:49.846]  And the systems that I and others are building will do that.
[00:46:50.907 --> 00:46:55.229]  Because of the way the system works, I am now a licensed arms dealer.
[00:46:55.249 --> 00:46:59.470]  So a computer scientist, businessman, arms dealer.
[00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:03.252]  Is that a progression?
[00:47:04.677 --> 00:47:05.077]  I don't know.
[00:47:05.157 --> 00:47:06.958]  I do not recommend this in your career path.
[00:47:07.018 --> 00:47:07.899]  I'd stick with AI.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:15.743]  And because of the way the laws work, we're doing this privately, and then this is all legal with the support of the governments.
[00:47:15.803 --> 00:47:18.004]  It goes straight into Ukraine, and then they fight the war.
[00:47:19.285 --> 00:47:23.367]  Oh my goodness, he just became interested in the military in the last year!
[00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.050]  He's always been one of the key guys in this.
[00:47:29.171 --> 00:47:30.831]  He's like, oh, I just decided, and...
[00:47:33.444 --> 00:47:34.584]  I mean, he says so much there.
[00:47:34.604 --> 00:47:35.425]  And then the lies.
[00:47:35.465 --> 00:47:37.425]  The West started the war with Russia 11 years ago.
[00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:43.908]  And he's like, oh, I was so mad when they're blowing up apartment buildings.
[00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:50.190]  Meanwhile, NATO just went into Russia and was blowing up apartment buildings.
[00:47:52.191 --> 00:47:54.872]  So, we need this really strong offensive robots.
[00:47:56.132 --> 00:47:58.593]  And I told you decades ago, they will be used on you and me.
[00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:06.821]  They are being used, and 15 years ago, they partially declassified.
[00:48:08.281 --> 00:48:11.622]  The Pentagon did, and the Sunshine Project republished it.
[00:48:11.662 --> 00:48:12.283]  I had them on air.
[00:48:15.323 --> 00:48:16.424]  That's more than 15 years ago.
[00:48:18.004 --> 00:48:19.024]  They declassified it in 2002.
[00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:31.051]  And a year later, the Pentagon reclassified it, and the FBI went to the Sunshine Project's offices in Austin and raided them over it, because they still have the documents, but they were already public.
[00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:32.492]  I had them on air.
[00:48:33.913 --> 00:48:34.693]  And what'd they have there?
[00:48:34.713 --> 00:48:39.516]  Marine and Army studies with the Air Force on pre-placing robot helicopters.
[00:48:40.777 --> 00:48:48.342]  They just put a robot brain in a helicopter, full-size helicopter, with giant spray tanks of opiate gas to knock out whole cities, or nerve gas to kill you.
[00:48:49.242 --> 00:48:50.003]  So there's the U.S.
[00:48:50.043 --> 00:48:50.343]  government
[00:48:52.453 --> 00:48:53.814]  30 years ago, planning this.
[00:48:54.274 --> 00:48:57.136]  20 years ago, or 18 years ago, whatever it is.
[00:48:59.397 --> 00:49:00.397]  Declassifying it.
[00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:04.139]  So, 30 years ago, they talk about the bases they've got.
[00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:08.561]  And a hangar, you just see out in the countryside, you know, it's... They get the order.
[00:49:10.462 --> 00:49:11.063]  Here it comes.
[00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:14.945]  So, they've already got this stuff in place.
[00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:19.507]  If my grandfather delivered
[00:49:21.295 --> 00:49:24.817]  Multiple robots, but he only got paid for the research.
[00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:25.977]  They never paid him to produce them.
[00:49:28.058 --> 00:49:30.699]  My grandfather was delivering robots for crowd control.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.422]  And my mother and uncle that was classified, they got to go out there and see it.
[00:49:38.282 --> 00:49:44.385]  And it was just basically like a tank, small tank with
[00:49:46.815 --> 00:50:00.605]  CCTV, primitive black and white cameras, radio backup systems, and then someone from eyesight drives into a crowd, and then the robot has all these cattle prod arms that comes out and starts shocking people.
[00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:06.750]  It's got a big diesel generator in it, and then they can put tear gas, you name it, or put guns on it.
[00:50:10.032 --> 00:50:14.055]  Now that's delivered in 1968 to the Pentagon by my grandfather.
[00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.191]  Can you imagine what they've got now?
[00:50:26.172 --> 00:50:27.332]  Alright, I'm done talking about that.
[00:50:28.673 --> 00:50:30.613]  I mentioned the stuff on Schmidt, overhead shot.
[00:50:32.374 --> 00:50:34.374]  You know what to do in the stock market.
[00:50:34.474 --> 00:50:42.276]  Insider Trading, NBC News, telling Stanford researchers to invest in the AI grid being put in.
[00:50:43.617 --> 00:50:47.598]  Ex-Google CEO Schmidt advises students to steal TikTok IP and clean up the mess later.
[00:50:49.403 --> 00:50:50.403]  It just goes on and on.
[00:50:52.444 --> 00:50:54.004]  All right, we're going to start the next hour.
[00:50:54.144 --> 00:50:55.704]  I already told you a lot of the news coming up.
[00:50:55.724 --> 00:50:56.624]  We're going to drill into all of it.
[00:50:56.644 --> 00:50:59.285]  We're going to look at the economy as well.
[00:50:59.425 --> 00:51:00.225]  Big developments there.
[00:51:00.685 --> 00:51:04.206]  Please remember, speaking of economy, I can't take on the new world order without you.
[00:51:04.226 --> 00:51:05.526]  I'm not backed by billionaires.
[00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:06.887]  I'm not backed by the establishment.
[00:51:06.907 --> 00:51:10.027]  I'm not backed by... I'm backed by regular people like you.
[00:51:10.927 --> 00:51:13.628]  And we're still on air and we beat their attempts to shut us down for now.
[00:51:15.768 --> 00:51:16.989]  But without your support, we won't be here.
[00:51:17.029 --> 00:51:18.831]  Plus, these are great products you need, so I need you again.
[00:51:19.472 --> 00:51:23.976]  Though, hey, this show's doing a pretty good job, and I like them fighting for my freedom and our freedom together.

[00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:39.208]  And check out InfoWars MD brand at InfoWars.
[00:52:50.034 --> 00:52:58.078]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:02.840]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:53:03.281 --> 00:53:05.482]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:06.322 --> 00:53:11.745]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:12.805 --> 00:53:21.369]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:23.550]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:28.693]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full wars.
[00:53:29.413 --> 00:53:35.076]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:35.096 --> 00:53:37.978]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:38.778 --> 00:53:40.299]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:53:41.516 --> 00:53:47.762]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you.
[00:53:48.242 --> 00:53:54.148]  And we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product.
[00:53:54.488 --> 00:53:57.531]  And then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:57.911 --> 00:54:01.335]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[00:54:01.355 --> 00:54:04.578]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:54:05.652 --> 00:54:06.953]  We're good to go.
[00:54:17.552 --> 00:54:25.654]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:25.735 --> 00:54:32.377]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:32.537 --> 00:54:35.017]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:35.197 --> 00:54:37.098]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:37.318 --> 00:54:47.084]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:47.705 --> 00:54:50.106]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:51.227]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:52.908 --> 00:54:59.611]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:05.393]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:05.493 --> 00:55:14.037]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:14.057 --> 00:55:16.218]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[00:55:17.768 --> 00:55:31.053]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:31.553 --> 00:55:35.934]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:35.994 --> 00:55:40.636]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:40.896 --> 00:55:41.396]  We're good to go.
[00:55:41.416 --> 00:55:42.677]  We're good to go.
[00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:43.797]  We're good to go.
[00:55:43.817 --> 00:55:44.717]  We're good to go.
[00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:45.458]  We're good to go.
[00:55:45.478 --> 00:55:45.798]  We're good to go.
[00:55:45.818 --> 00:55:46.538]  We're good to go.
[00:55:46.578 --> 00:55:47.158]  We're good to go.
[00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:47.959]  We're good to go.
[00:55:47.979 --> 00:55:48.659]  We're good to go.
[00:55:48.719 --> 00:55:49.199]  We're good to go.
[00:55:49.259 --> 00:55:49.959]  We're good to go.
[00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:50.620]  We're good to go.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.220]  We're good to go.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:51.940]  We're good to go.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.760]  We're good to go.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.381]  We're good to go.
[00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:54.021]  We're good to go.
[00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:54.601]  We're good to go.
[00:55:54.641 --> 00:55:55.141]  We're good to go.
[00:55:55.161 --> 00:55:56.182]  We're good to go.
[00:55:56.202 --> 00:55:57.582]  We're good to go.
[00:55:57.682 --> 00:55:58.403]  We're good to go.
[00:55:58.443 --> 00:55:59.283]  We're good to go.
[00:55:59.303 --> 00:56:00.363]  We're good to go.
[00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:01.024]  We're good to go.
[00:56:01.044 --> 00:56:01.644]  We're good to go.
[00:56:01.664 --> 00:56:02.184]  We're good to go.
[00:56:02.204 --> 00:56:02.804]  We're good to go.
[00:56:02.844 --> 00:56:03.705]  We're good to go.
[00:56:03.745 --> 00:56:04.765]  We're good to go.
[00:56:04.925 --> 00:56:05.945]  We're good to go.
[00:56:05.965 --> 00:56:06.926]  We're good to go.
[00:56:07.026 --> 00:56:08.006]  We're good to go.
[00:56:08.066 --> 00:56:08.466]  We're good to go.
[00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:09.407]  We're good to go.
[00:56:09.427 --> 00:56:09.947]  We're good to go.
[00:56:10.027 --> 00:56:10.167]  We're
[00:56:10.307 --> 00:56:10.627]  Thank you.
[00:56:39.932 --> 00:56:43.595]  Hey, a lot of stations don't carry this first five and I want to hit all this news and everybody's able to tune in.
[00:56:44.455 --> 00:56:48.338]  For all the young folks watching on X, this thing's still called talk radio and it still reaches a lot of people.
[00:56:49.619 --> 00:56:51.280]  But I wanted to play more of these Trump clips anyways.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:55.864]  Here's Trump on, well, there's a bunch of these clips.
[00:56:57.084 --> 00:56:57.605]  Go ahead and roll them.
[00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:05.591]  I remember when just a short while ago, Kerry goes, you know, hops in his private plane, flies to China.
[00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:13.149]  To talk about the energy prices and the energy situation in China with President Xi, who I know very well.
[00:57:13.669 --> 00:57:18.391]  Had a very good relationship until COVID came in, but that was a fence too far.
[00:57:19.192 --> 00:57:20.573]  But we had a great relationship.
[00:57:20.693 --> 00:57:23.194]  And Kerry would go up there and he'd leave so happy.
[00:57:23.234 --> 00:57:24.555]  But they don't do anything.
[00:57:24.595 --> 00:57:25.275]  They just talk.
[00:57:25.735 --> 00:57:27.556]  They said, oh yeah, we're going to do that.
[00:57:27.656 --> 00:57:28.637]  Oh, as soon as we get to it.
[00:57:28.657 --> 00:57:32.779]  In the meantime, they're building a coal plant every week.
[00:57:33.179 --> 00:57:35.501]  But now I hear it's two coal plants a week.
[00:57:36.241 --> 00:57:37.662]  And we're dying for energy.
[00:57:37.742 --> 00:57:38.722]  We don't have energy.
[00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.423]  And they're getting set for the A.I.
[00:57:40.463 --> 00:57:42.463]  because they're going to create so much electricity.
[00:57:42.984 --> 00:57:44.344]  And we're not going to be able to do it.
[00:57:44.384 --> 00:57:48.146]  But you'll do it if I have it, because that's an emergency.
[00:57:48.206 --> 00:57:54.728]  We have to be able to compete with China and other countries that are able to create new energy if they want to.
[00:57:54.808 --> 00:57:55.628]  And they're going to want to.
[00:57:55.688 --> 00:57:56.549]  And they do want to.
[00:57:57.449 --> 00:58:00.050]  Germany, as you know, went a little bit like us.
[00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.211]  And that was the end of Angola because their whole
[00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:03.243]  I think?
[00:58:22.677 --> 00:58:26.160]  Creating great energy plants, great sources of energy.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:33.786]  Instead of playing this game with wind that is ruining everything, killing all your birds, destroying the fields, all these gorgeous fields.
[00:58:34.266 --> 00:58:37.068]  You got windmills all over the place and you have birds.
[00:58:37.088 --> 00:58:38.609]  You want to see a bird cemetery?
[00:58:38.649 --> 00:58:39.730]  Just go under a windmill.
[00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.512]  You see thousands of birds dead.
[00:58:42.642 --> 00:58:46.825]  The bald eagle, if you kill an eagle, they put you in jail for years.
[00:58:47.626 --> 00:58:50.088]  And yet these windmills knock them out like nothing.
[00:58:50.688 --> 00:58:52.229]  And nothing happens to the people.
[00:58:52.449 --> 00:58:54.411]  Now, it's a green scam.
[00:58:54.811 --> 00:58:55.612]  It's a shame.
[00:58:55.672 --> 00:58:57.053]  Look, I'm all for clean energy.
[00:58:57.093 --> 00:58:58.013]  I want clean water.
[00:58:58.033 --> 00:58:58.794]  I want clean air.
[00:58:59.675 --> 00:59:01.576]  But you can't destroy your country over it.
[00:59:02.217 --> 00:59:03.237]  You just can't do that.
[00:59:03.538 --> 00:59:04.498]  We're going to seal the border.
[00:59:05.079 --> 00:59:06.480]  We're going to stop the invasion.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.681]  We're going to send the illegal aliens back home.
[00:59:08.701 --> 00:59:11.704]  We're going to bring down the cost of health care and housing.
[00:59:12.469 --> 00:59:19.031]  We're going to make sure that Social Security is not going to be increased in terms of years where people have to wait much longer.
[00:59:20.012 --> 00:59:23.634]  I mean, we have an obligation to take care of these people.
[00:59:24.014 --> 00:59:26.816]  And just so you know, I didn't do it in four years.
[00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.297]  I never even thought about doing it in four years.
[00:59:30.178 --> 00:59:34.100]  And they probably don't want to do it, but they're going to have no choice.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:38.423]  Because a lot of the people that are coming in are being signed into Medicare.
[00:59:38.463 --> 00:59:40.364]  They're being signed into Social Security.
[00:59:40.884 --> 00:59:42.125]  And it's just going to explode.
[00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.886]  And it's going to happen very fast, and it's going to be very ugly.
[00:59:46.047 --> 00:59:47.228]  We're not going to happen with us.
[00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:51.368]  We're going to open up tracts of federal land for housing construction.
[00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:55.649]  We desperately need housing for people who can't afford what's going on now.
[00:59:56.829 --> 01:00:01.150]  You know, Trump does a great job, but he still acts like they're incompetent.
[01:00:02.111 --> 01:00:03.691]  No, they want price controls.
[01:00:03.731 --> 01:00:07.612]  They want to cut off the energy to shut down the economy and make us dependent on them.
[01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:09.673]  That's what communists do.
[01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.133]  It's like, oh, they're going to have to fix Social Security.
[01:00:12.153 --> 01:00:13.194]  They're going to have to fix all this.
[01:00:13.214 --> 01:00:14.834]  No, they're deliberately trying to wreck it.
[01:00:15.922 --> 01:00:17.682]  So, let's just get that straight.
[01:00:18.142 --> 01:00:19.063]  This is on purpose.
[01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:26.484]  It's a big article on Infowars.com by the Von Mies Institute explaining Kamala's controllers don't want price controls to fix things.
[01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:28.384]  They know it'll wreck their damn economy.
[01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:29.064]  That's their plan.
[01:00:29.484 --> 01:00:31.765]  Now into our number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:33.845]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:43.367]  Well, this invasion 12 days ago of Russia by NATO is very dangerous.
[01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:44.407]  We'll be hitting that in a moment.
[01:00:45.922 --> 01:00:52.047]  We also have Kamala and her controllers running around trying to steal Trump's economic agenda, which of course they'll never implement.
[01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:58.032]  They need to promise you they'll do that, show that you'll be an idiot and vote for them.
[01:00:58.372 --> 01:01:01.014]  They never deliver on anything they say they'll do other than open borders.
[01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:13.305]  And then we've got gold at all-time highs, as predicted three months ago, and a month ago, and nine months ago, and a week ago by Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:20.990]  Gold prices at all-time high of over $2,500 an ounce as traders jump on great cut train.
[01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:23.811]  Mining stocks on the move.
[01:01:24.832 --> 01:01:26.132]  We'll show you that graph.
[01:01:26.192 --> 01:01:26.893]  I mean, look at that.
[01:01:29.214 --> 01:01:30.815]  Very important information.
[01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:34.257]  Gold prices surpassed $2,500 an ounce.
[01:01:35.537 --> 01:01:36.438]  Four moves to make now.
[01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:42.001]  We're going to be talking about this with Dr. Kirk Kelly in a moment, but I wanted to play this clip of Trump on inflation.
[01:01:43.479 --> 01:01:46.040]  And he said it right in the last three interviews and speeches.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.101]  The three I saw, he's done even more than that.
[01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.481]  Kamala's hiding in a basement.
[01:01:50.642 --> 01:01:51.222]  We're explained.
[01:01:51.762 --> 01:01:55.844]  The only way to cut inflation, folks, is innovation and cheap energy.
[01:01:56.624 --> 01:01:58.304]  That is the only thing you can counter this with.
[01:01:58.825 --> 01:02:02.026]  But again, the globalists are cutting energy while they inflate currencies.
[01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:06.047]  That's the perfect storm to bring us to our knees.
[01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:07.308]  It's on purpose.
[01:02:07.408 --> 01:02:09.168]  It's done by design.
[01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:10.909]  And you've got to get to the point.
[01:02:10.969 --> 01:02:11.829]  I love Rush Limbaugh.
[01:02:11.849 --> 01:02:12.290]  Great guy.
[01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.750]  Meant well.
[01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.512]  But to the day he died, he was like, these liberals are idiots.
[01:02:18.013 --> 01:02:20.094]  Their policies don't work.
[01:02:20.814 --> 01:02:22.475]  They're not meant to work.
[01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:25.177]  They admit they want to sabotage stuff.
[01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:27.879]  Can we just get to the point of admitting they're villains?
[01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:29.620]  They're dicks?
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:30.961]  I mean...
[01:02:33.243 --> 01:02:38.145]  Look at El Salvador, most dangerous country in the world, now the second safest in the world, a boom town.
[01:02:38.345 --> 01:02:43.707]  They got one good leader, fired the bad people, arrested the criminal gangs who had committed all these crimes, and they just turned around.
[01:02:43.987 --> 01:02:45.848]  Good folks, we have unlimited potential.
[01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:47.148]  Look at all the stuff we've got.
[01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:50.689]  But the globalists don't want you to be self-sufficient.
[01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:54.591]  They don't want an upwardly mobile system because they can't control an open free market.
[01:02:55.717 --> 01:02:59.280]  So here's Trump on grocery prices, and then another, just a quick clip.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.343]  I'll put Citizens Up, making key points, and we'll go to Dr. Kirk Elliott in this Gold News.
[01:03:04.745 --> 01:03:06.806]  Grocery prices have skyrocketed.
[01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:07.787]  Cereals are up 26%.
[01:03:07.907 --> 01:03:08.648]  Bread is up 24%.
[01:03:08.688 --> 01:03:10.389]  Butter is up 37%.
[01:03:10.429 --> 01:03:11.330]  Baby formula is up 30%.
[01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:12.011]  Flour is up 38%.
[01:03:12.111 --> 01:03:13.252]  And eggs are up 46%.
[01:03:13.412 --> 01:03:15.674]  And many items are up at much higher rates than that.
[01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:29.060]  Now Kamala is reportedly proposing communist price controls.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.321]  She wants price controls.
[01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.182]  And if they worked, I'd go along with it too.
[01:03:33.202 --> 01:03:33.903]  But they don't work.
[01:03:33.923 --> 01:03:37.405]  They actually have the exact opposite impact and effect.
[01:03:37.806 --> 01:03:43.890]  But it leads to food shortages, rationing, hunger, dramatically more inflation.
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:47.012]  Their Inflation Reduction Act, by the way, was a disaster.
[01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:51.900]  Does anybody else feel like we're in the Twilight Zone with this whole Kamala Harris thing?
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:58.885]  Like this is a bad episode of Punk'd and we're just waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come hopping out of a bush somewhere?
[01:03:59.866 --> 01:04:03.249]  Do these people not realize that she is currently the VP?
[01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:13.317]  She's part of this administration, which is what we've been living for the last three and a half years, yet when you try to ask them what do you think she's going to do,
[01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:18.751]  Differently than what we've experienced the last three and a half years, they don't have a single answer.
[01:04:19.852 --> 01:04:28.194]  This one guy I was talking to the other day was like, well, she's gonna put things in place to get inflation back where it needs to be and boost the economy.
[01:04:30.455 --> 01:04:30.695]  What?
[01:04:32.995 --> 01:04:39.557]  These people are so far checked out of reality, it blows the mind.
[01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.098]  She could have already done that.
[01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.851]  She's had three and a half years to do exactly that!
[01:04:46.311 --> 01:04:51.734]  And you honestly think she's just gonna pull the answers out of her ass all of a sudden because you nominated her president?
[01:04:52.574 --> 01:04:55.495]  She had all the answers, she just didn't bother to tell anybody?
[01:04:56.056 --> 01:04:56.956]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:04:57.516 --> 01:04:58.997]  Please, help us understand!
[01:05:01.687 --> 01:05:03.188]  All right, here's the deal.
[01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:07.329]  I've been on air 30 plus years, and I just tell you what I think is really going on.
[01:05:07.729 --> 01:05:08.670]  Now, sometimes I'm wrong.
[01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.530]  Not often.
[01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:11.011]  And I wish I was wrong about everything.
[01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:13.232]  But this is so easy to call.
[01:05:13.972 --> 01:05:16.573]  You've got top Democrat operatives saying they're going to have a civil war.
[01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.454]  They will not allow Trump into office.
[01:05:18.474 --> 01:05:19.414]  They're going to try to kill him again.
[01:05:20.855 --> 01:05:23.136]  You've got NATO invading Russia.
[01:05:24.496 --> 01:05:28.938]  You've got AI robots rolling out.
[01:05:30.413 --> 01:05:32.234]  I mean, this is satanic.
[01:05:33.315 --> 01:05:48.365]  And that's why I love Dr. Kirk Elliott, because he's not just a great economist, somebody I've known about for 25 years, he's not just the top silver broker in the country, and a third in gold, because he doesn't push gold, he's been dead on for 10 months with us on air.
[01:05:49.305 --> 01:05:56.750]  And he said last week, and he said a month ago, and a month before that, a month before that, going back, gold will break its all-time high.
[01:05:57.651 --> 01:05:59.092]  He said, I think, imminently.
[01:06:00.717 --> 01:06:06.379]  And when they did the whole stock market correction, he said, notice gold and silver didn't go down much compared to the overall correction.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.400]  He said, I think we'll have a rebound.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.861]  If I had the crew, the crew's great.
[01:06:10.881 --> 01:06:11.861]  I don't have a big enough crew.
[01:06:11.881 --> 01:06:12.862]  We'd have those clips for you right now.
[01:06:12.922 --> 01:06:16.203]  But I've told Kirk with his crew, they should get those clips.
[01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:16.683]  We'll play them.
[01:06:16.703 --> 01:06:18.024]  But the point is, you heard him last week.
[01:06:18.304 --> 01:06:20.104]  You heard him two weeks ago, three weeks ago, a month ago.
[01:06:20.124 --> 01:06:21.505]  You heard him 10 months ago.
[01:06:23.353 --> 01:06:25.294]  But this is not hard predictions, as he said.
[01:06:25.974 --> 01:06:29.455]  The difference is you tune into corporate media, they're not going to tell you the truth most of the time.
[01:06:29.575 --> 01:06:36.158]  But now, they're suddenly admitting silver could go to $50, $60, $70 an ounce.
[01:06:36.978 --> 01:06:36.158]  $100.
[01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:39.379]  I've got the headlines right here, I'll show them to you.
[01:06:39.699 --> 01:06:41.099]  Now they're saying gold could easily hit $5,000.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:07:09.237]  And it's not that gold's really gonna go to $5,000 in the old term, it's that the inflation's so bad, it's being recognized ahead of time as a commodity, because the elites and the big corporations and governments, the Chinese and the Indians and everybody else, and the universities are buying up silver and gold, as Kirk said last week and 10 months ago, there isn't enough silver for the big banks and the rich people to even get it.
[01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:12.732]  There's barely enough gold.
[01:07:12.872 --> 01:07:15.313]  So when there moves into gold, they're already shooting it way up.
[01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:18.654]  If they move into silver, because it's not there, it'd go to $500 an ounce.
[01:07:18.714 --> 01:07:21.316]  I mean, my God, it's just, that's supply and demand.
[01:07:21.716 --> 01:07:22.916]  There isn't enough of it.
[01:07:23.316 --> 01:07:30.120]  That's why the silver's, you know, exploding, but it hasn't hit there yet, because it's so scarce.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.141]  It's something the big boys can't even really enter into.
[01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:36.042]  So I agree with him, and he's been proven right.
[01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:42.046]  In correspondence with gold, it's gone up more than gold in the aggregate.
[01:07:42.427 --> 01:07:43.888]  But he's an economist, he can explain it.
[01:07:43.928 --> 01:07:50.933]  But you said last week, a month ago, over and over again, you expected it to break all-time highs very soon.
[01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:51.594]  It's done it.
[01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:53.315]  What does this signify?
[01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.777]  They're trying to cover up what happened in the stock market.
[01:07:55.877 --> 01:08:00.401]  Everything's fine, but they're admitting Chinese housing crises that is a contagion.
[01:08:01.836 --> 01:08:03.418]  We're good to go.
[01:08:16.767 --> 01:08:21.291]  Oh, it's so great to be with you again, Alex, and there there is a lot going on right now.
[01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:32.562]  And to me, when I said this isn't rocket science, right, this is this is an easy thing to predict that gold would hit its all time highs is because we were actually getting really close.
[01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:32.822]  Right.
[01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:35.605]  It's like and what causes.
[01:08:35.685 --> 01:08:36.486]  So here's the thing.
[01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.288]  What causes gold and silver to go up?
[01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:42.512]  Outside of just supply and demand, right?
[01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:48.540]  When you have low inventory and you have high demand, prices are going to go up, right?
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:55.488]  But there's two things that impact gold and silver, and silver has an extra
[01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:58.070]  Kind of push under it right now.
[01:08:58.170 --> 01:09:02.953]  So, so gold and silver act as a flight for quality, Alex.
[01:09:02.993 --> 01:09:16.141]  So when the foundations around us are eroding, when the world is falling apart, when there's wars and rumors of wars and inflation and political chaos, and you, you look at the Democrat nominee for president, right?
[01:09:16.201 --> 01:09:19.463]  You look at what Kamala is doing and she's absolute communist, right?
[01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:22.845]  And, and is there going to be a fair election election?
[01:09:22.905 --> 01:09:23.446]  What about
[01:09:23.866 --> 01:09:24.546]  Monkeypox.
[01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:26.628]  And what about the bird flu and all this stuff?
[01:09:26.668 --> 01:09:30.710]  It's like, oh, this is going to shut down the global economy, right?
[01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:38.055]  When people start feeling that and they start in their mind to play out, what does this look like?
[01:09:38.115 --> 01:09:41.377]  Is this going to be like 2020 all over again?
[01:09:41.797 --> 01:09:43.098]  Are we going to shut down?
[01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:45.680]  Are we going to lose our store?
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.240]  Are we going to lose our livelihood?
[01:09:47.301 --> 01:09:52.324]  Are we going to have to dip in to our savings accounts just to survive?
[01:09:53.044 --> 01:09:54.625]  And we've got an election coming up.
[01:09:54.985 --> 01:09:56.145]  Is it going to be fair?
[01:09:56.645 --> 01:09:56.825]  Right?
[01:09:56.885 --> 01:10:06.709]  And what about this stupid bird flu thing where we've heard the COVID was 0.6% mortality rate and bird flu has 20% mortality rate.
[01:10:07.109 --> 01:10:16.392]  And now yesterday, World Health Organization decided monkey pox, right, was a world health emergency in Europe.
[01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:17.373]  And it's like, what?
[01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:19.114]  Is going on.
[01:10:19.514 --> 01:10:36.986]  See these kind of things that erode people's confidence in the future and how it's going to look are the flight for quality kind of impulses that cause people to go into gold and silver because they thrive on things like this.
[01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:42.810]  So so then you add the more fundamental elements outside of the
[01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:47.513]  There's these perception-type elements and the fear factor that gets played into it.
[01:10:47.973 --> 01:10:56.040]  The fundamentals are, you know, when inflation is persisting, gold and silver are things, Alex.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:05.767]  So things go up with inflation, like that chart or picture you had on the screen, looking at the price of eggs and the price of everything, the price of groceries and the price of all this stuff.
[01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:09.190]  Inflation is going through the roof.
[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:18.353]  And people can blame anybody that they want for inflation, but this is a, inflation is truly a function of the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:18.853 --> 01:11:28.337]  When you print a ton of money to provide stimulus for everything, to raise the debt ceiling, to whatever they have to spend money on.
[01:11:29.037 --> 01:11:34.939]  That devalues the currency and then it takes more of that junk currency to buy valuable goods and services.
[01:11:35.519 --> 01:11:39.660]  That's why, to me, inflation, Alex, isn't rising prices.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.061]  That's a symptom of inflation.
[01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:45.842]  Inflation is nothing more than just an increasing money supply, right?
[01:11:45.862 --> 01:11:47.823]  And they're printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:50.324]  Now, here's the issue that we have.
[01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:57.446]  In the past, we could print money like there was no tomorrow because we were the world's reserve currency.
[01:11:58.166 --> 01:12:00.707]  It's like, all oil settlements were traded in U.S.
[01:12:00.747 --> 01:12:01.067]  dollars.
[01:12:01.087 --> 01:12:03.388]  It didn't matter if we treated it like monopoly money.
[01:12:03.428 --> 01:12:05.669]  There was built-in demand for our currency.
[01:12:06.129 --> 01:12:06.590]  No more.
[01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:17.194]  Because in January of this year, when the BRICS nations added all the, basically the OPEC nations, UAE and Iran and Saudi Arabia and, I mean,
[01:12:18.054 --> 01:12:21.777]  They're now trading in different currencies other than the U.S.
[01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:22.537]  dollar for oil.
[01:12:22.897 --> 01:12:24.258]  Now there's no built-in demand.
[01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:27.540]  So whenever we print money, it's devaluing it.
[01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:29.322]  The rest of the world isn't wanting it.
[01:12:29.362 --> 01:12:30.502]  They're dumping the U.S.
[01:12:30.562 --> 01:12:31.023]  Treasuries.
[01:12:31.603 --> 01:12:33.825]  Now, our printing of money
[01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:49.214]  Is actually we have to look at the ramifications before we ever do anything because we're no different anymore than Argentina or Venezuela or Zimbabwe or any of these countries that aren't the world's reserve currency.
[01:12:49.614 --> 01:12:54.958]  We're now that so the inflationary pressures cause gold and silver to go up then.
[01:12:55.818 --> 01:13:05.067]  You have the political landscape of it, which is central banks are now allocating into gold
[01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.610]  Even though they say gold has stunk for decades, right?
[01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:16.472]  You don't want to go into that ancient relic, right, when we can control the money supply or the interest rate or the reserve requirements or anything with the flip of a switch.
[01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:31.035]  Central banks are allocating into gold as a backstop to hedge against the inflationary pressures, to give their currency more credibility, and you've got central banks buying gold like that.
[01:13:31.095 --> 01:13:33.056]  And the Russians are talking about going pure gold back.
[01:13:34.508 --> 01:13:34.868]  I know.
[01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:48.812]  I mean, this is this is the kind of paradigm shifting moment in history where banking as we know it, money creation as we know it, is changing right underneath our very eyes.
[01:13:48.852 --> 01:13:52.013]  And so you've got this this battle waging.
[01:13:52.073 --> 01:13:58.715]  It's like, are we going to purely have digital money, central bank digital currency, which is nothing more than fiat money that's digital?
[01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:02.016]  Or are we going to go to some kind of tangible backing?
[01:14:02.056 --> 01:14:02.356]  I don't know.
[01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:24.870]  This whole social credit score as the new fiat system, a unified ledger, where all our money is controlled by them.
[01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:32.094]  But instead, we can offer the alternatives of farmland and local businesses and shop local and gold and silver.
[01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:34.875]  We don't have to sit there and accept their solution.
[01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:40.678]  Meanwhile, the globalists and the rich people are buying silver and gold because they don't even believe in their fiat system.
[01:14:42.539 --> 01:14:43.741]  They don't the central banks.
[01:14:43.821 --> 01:14:47.404]  I mean, this is this is the wildest thing to me behind the scenes.
[01:14:48.165 --> 01:14:54.592]  China now has estimated like 30,000 tons 30,000 tons of gold.
[01:14:55.212 --> 01:15:00.638]  You know, Russia has over a thousand tons of gold India 600 tons the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:01.258 --> 01:15:03.720]  Has an estimated 8,500 tons of gold.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.683]  The European Central Bank, 10,500 tons of gold.
[01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:08.684]  It's like, Kirk, what are you talking about?
[01:15:08.965 --> 01:15:10.106]  These banks hate gold.
[01:15:10.126 --> 01:15:11.647]  They've been poo-pooing it for a long time.
[01:15:11.687 --> 01:15:14.649]  Yeah, well, they've been poo-pooing it and suppressing the price.
[01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:17.332]  They've been gobbling it up like it's candy, right?
[01:15:17.372 --> 01:15:22.936]  It's like, so they're backing up their currency in preparation for what's coming.
[01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:24.057]  Now, let's just say
[01:15:24.918 --> 01:15:26.959]  It is a central bank digital currency.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:37.947]  They're going to want some kind of a backstop to their currency to say, hey world, our currency, our CBDC, is better than others because we have gold backing behind it.
[01:15:38.407 --> 01:15:49.434]  See, in a world where everything is falling apart, where the foundations are eroding, people want quality, they want transparency, they want something that's real, right?
[01:15:49.494 --> 01:15:51.556]  So this is where gold and silver both,
[01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:57.900]  Fall into that category of of flight quality for something that's valuable.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.881]  But now silver has something different.
[01:16:00.642 --> 01:16:02.923]  Silver is also an industrial metal.
[01:16:03.023 --> 01:16:06.646]  It's used for manufacturing, whether it's defense.
[01:16:07.046 --> 01:16:09.848]  The defense industry is the largest user of silver.
[01:16:09.968 --> 01:16:12.189]  So it's basically in the rare earth mineral category.
[01:16:12.249 --> 01:16:13.010]  And we've talked about that.
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:15.371]  So let's I want to get into a bunch of news with you.
[01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:21.636]  Get your view on the economy, inflation, Trump, the assassination, what they're going to do next when we come back.
[01:16:22.296 --> 01:16:26.337]  In a few minutes, but we've got six, seven minutes to break, but let's get it up front here.
[01:16:27.158 --> 01:16:29.578]  You're the biggest silver broker in the United States, maybe in the world.
[01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:34.520]  You're one of the biggest gold guys who would promote gold because obviously silver has the most to move up.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.180]  You've been proven right.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.420]  You're cheering people in the right direction.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.181]  You can sell them gold all day, but you're not.
[01:16:39.322 --> 01:16:39.802]  We're good to go.
[01:17:01.164 --> 01:17:04.567]  I'm not going to sell people numismatics at 50% or 100%.
[01:17:05.028 --> 01:17:09.231]  You do 8%, people can sell it back for no cost.
[01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:10.172]  That's a huge value.
[01:17:10.733 --> 01:17:13.755]  You've got to have your brokers advise, do your stuff, your sponsorship.
[01:17:16.278 --> 01:17:17.278]  You go off volume.
[01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:19.400]  That's how you're operating.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.984]  But we have been offered by like four or five companies now.
[01:17:24.136 --> 01:17:41.371]  The last few months, three, four, five, six times what you're sponsoring us for, but they want me to turn them loose on the audience and say, go get gold and silver here, and then they sell them supposedly collectibles and all this stuff, that sure, maybe sometimes a collectible's worth something, you know, but it's a very hard market to deal with.
[01:17:41.651 --> 01:17:48.036]  When you sell stuff at wholesale, because you've got spot, then there's the cost of the selling it, so it's a few percentage points above that.
[01:17:48.417 --> 01:17:52.040]  When you sell stuff at wholesale, people can Google wholesale price,
[01:17:53.015 --> 01:17:56.476]  They can look it up for themselves, and then they can call you and see they're getting that.
[01:17:56.956 --> 01:17:57.776]  That's the big difference.
[01:17:57.816 --> 01:18:01.197]  So, to me, I mean, we're selling iced tea in the Sahara Desert.
[01:18:01.217 --> 01:18:04.539]  We're selling people coats in Siberia.
[01:18:04.979 --> 01:18:06.519]  This is such a smart move.
[01:18:06.879 --> 01:18:10.760]  And as you said, once the general public figures it out, the evidence is clear.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:16.022]  I'm not saying 100%, but I think it will explode even more once the public figures it out.
[01:18:16.062 --> 01:18:17.142]  It's already starting to happen.
[01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:18.503]  So people need to call you.
[01:18:19.483 --> 01:18:25.147]  Get a consultation, a free consultation, and they need to get silver and gold right now.
[01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:28.809]  So speak to how they call you, what they do, and when is it time to buy gold.
[01:18:29.977 --> 01:18:39.788]  Yeah, so call 720-605-3900 and just say Alex sent you, or go to kepm.com forward slash gold, where you type in your information.
[01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:45.434]  One of my schedulers will call you, hear your dreams, hear your goals, hear your fears, right?
[01:18:45.574 --> 01:18:50.200]  And will help then set up an appointment with one of my amazing consultants where we'll
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.521]  We're good.
[01:19:06.998 --> 01:19:08.699]  And then we want to educate.
[01:19:08.779 --> 01:19:17.865]  Our goal is to educate, empower, grow with you, go through this economy with you and let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, do whatever needs to be done.
[01:19:17.966 --> 01:19:22.749]  Right now, when we do this, we only use bullion, Alex, which is key.
[01:19:23.109 --> 01:19:27.512]  This is what differentiates us from like every other firm on the planet.
[01:19:27.532 --> 01:19:29.393]  8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:31.495]  But bullion, there's always a market for it.
[01:19:31.595 --> 01:19:32.235]  And it's cheap.
[01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:36.178]  It's 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate on top of wholesale.
[01:19:36.298 --> 01:19:36.438]  Now,
[01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:45.045]  I just got an invoice from a person who called me yesterday and said, Kirk, I just went with a big national dealer that I heard on another show.
[01:19:45.526 --> 01:19:46.026]  You know what?
[01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:56.936]  You should not be paying more than like $2,900 an ounce for gold and like 32 bucks an ounce or so for silver with where the spot prices are today.
[01:19:57.296 --> 01:20:00.639]  With gold being at an all-time high, you shouldn't be paying all that much for it.
[01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:06.904]  These people paid $4,400 an ounce for gold, $81 an ounce for silver.
[01:20:07.444 --> 01:20:07.905]  You know what?
[01:20:08.045 --> 01:20:10.266]  They will never recover from that.
[01:20:10.767 --> 01:20:19.314]  To me, that's sickening, and it's disgusting, and I don't know how people can sleep at night, which is why when you go with bullion, it's low cost.
[01:20:19.494 --> 01:20:20.815]  One of the keys to wealth
[01:20:21.435 --> 01:20:21.756]  We're good.
[01:20:40.214 --> 01:20:44.397]  In like 2009, something like that happened where it actually worked.
[01:20:44.678 --> 01:20:48.180]  But that is way too much risk, way too expensive.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:55.286]  It's like when you go to the grocery store, you don't go in and say, I'm going to buy the most expensive groceries I can find and then triple pay for it.
[01:20:55.686 --> 01:21:00.850]  No, you want to go in and get the lowest cost, best thing that you can.
[01:21:01.251 --> 01:21:03.052]  This is why we focus on bullion.
[01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.714]  Maximize your ounces, Alex.
[01:21:05.734 --> 01:21:06.355]  That's our goal.
[01:21:08.055 --> 01:21:10.278]  Well, now is the time to get silver.
[01:21:11.059 --> 01:21:13.142]  How much is silver up the last few years versus gold?
[01:21:13.182 --> 01:21:14.464]  I know everybody's focusing on gold.
[01:21:15.646 --> 01:21:17.028]  And hell, I want to fund the operations.
[01:21:17.068 --> 01:21:18.590]  I'm not saying, I think silver's better.
[01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:19.251]  People want gold.
[01:21:19.271 --> 01:21:20.733]  They can get gold from you right now, right?
[01:21:21.892 --> 01:21:22.993]  Yeah, they can get gold.
[01:21:23.334 --> 01:21:28.060]  I would just recommend you go into silver because you look at where silver was four years ago.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.882]  It was $11.91 an ounce.
[01:21:29.942 --> 01:21:30.382]  Today, it's $29.
[01:21:30.643 --> 01:21:36.029]  It's like, okay, that's up well over 140% over the last four years, right?
[01:21:36.049 --> 01:21:37.051]  And over the last five months,
[01:21:40.655 --> 01:21:42.356]  Silver's gone from 22 to 29.
[01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:46.158]  That's, I don't know, up 30-something percent in five months.
[01:21:46.419 --> 01:21:47.339]  That's incredible.
[01:21:47.799 --> 01:21:49.200]  Gold is going up, too.
[01:21:49.561 --> 01:22:02.148]  But I just read a research paper this morning that they're expecting gold with where the prices are and where the trend is in supply and demand, they're expecting silver to double the rate of growth of gold.
[01:22:02.609 --> 01:22:04.270]  Now, I'm expecting more than that.
[01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.751]  I think silver probably triples rate of growth of gold.
[01:22:07.771 --> 01:22:08.491]  And I'm not God.
[01:22:08.551 --> 01:22:09.691]  I don't control the markets.
[01:22:09.731 --> 01:22:09.911]  Right.
[01:22:09.951 --> 01:22:16.332]  But but when you look at the supply and demand discrepancies and what silver is needed for.
[01:22:16.732 --> 01:22:17.793]  So here's my strategy.
[01:22:18.073 --> 01:22:19.653]  We allocate into silver now.
[01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:23.334]  And if it doubles or triples the rate of growth of gold, we sell it.
[01:22:23.374 --> 01:22:24.694]  We start selling it.
[01:22:25.114 --> 01:22:29.215]  You know, probably over the next four or five months, we'll sell off a possession of yours.
[01:22:29.775 --> 01:22:30.075]  We're good.
[01:22:43.686 --> 01:22:44.706]  Yes, I would.
[01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:55.671]  But the way that the prices are moving, with the geopolitical conflict, everything we're going to talk about on the next segment, the news, that is propellants to cause gold and silver to go up.
[01:22:56.032 --> 01:22:56.912]  That's right.
[01:22:56.992 --> 01:22:58.052]  I would allocate quickly.
[01:22:58.333 --> 01:23:02.034]  KEPM.com forward slash gold, KPM.com forward slash gold, or 720-605-3900.
[01:23:02.094 --> 01:23:04.415]  We'll be right back with Hunter Kirk-Elliott.
[01:23:04.635 --> 01:23:05.196]  Nitric boost.
[01:23:05.236 --> 01:23:05.496]  Tumeric 95.
[01:23:11.098 --> 01:23:14.019]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:19.922]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:23:20.422 --> 01:23:27.585]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:23:28.145 --> 01:23:30.126]  They let us private label their products.
[01:23:30.146 --> 01:23:31.027]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:23:31.887 --> 01:23:32.928]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[01:23:33.248 --> 01:23:35.709]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:23:35.769 --> 01:23:37.570]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:40.831]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:23:41.591 --> 01:23:42.212]  That's the name.
[01:23:42.472 --> 01:23:48.955]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[01:23:49.175 --> 01:23:50.235]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[01:23:50.676 --> 01:23:52.296]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:54.337]  They even let us use their name.
[01:23:54.617 --> 01:23:55.638]  It's now our best seller.
[01:23:55.838 --> 01:23:56.838]  We sold out of our version.
[01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.539]  Their version has a white model.
[01:23:58.879 --> 01:24:00.260]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.361]  You get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:05.142]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:21.331 --> 01:24:22.091]  InfoWars.
[01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:24.072]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:27.554]  Why do we sit there and act like these people are so important?
[01:24:28.835 --> 01:24:35.277]  And still the old politicians, especially the Republicans, they still put stock in what the media says, the corporate media.
[01:24:35.618 --> 01:24:37.858]  You want to be attacked by CNN.
[01:24:38.539 --> 01:24:40.499]  You want to be attacked by ABC News.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:47.382]  It just shows that they've done everything they can to destroy me and demonize me and say all these horrible things that I'm not.
[01:24:48.262 --> 01:24:49.923]  And it hasn't worked.
[01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:55.923]  Yeah, I lied about WMDs in Iraq and tripled the sanctions that starved two and a half million people to death, a million kids.
[01:24:56.243 --> 01:24:57.344]  Yeah, I opened the borders up.
[01:24:57.444 --> 01:24:58.465]  I shipped the fentanyl in.
[01:24:58.685 --> 01:24:59.826]  I run the giant rape gangs.
[01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:01.327]  I'm starting World War III with Russia.
[01:25:01.787 --> 01:25:03.268]  I'm cutting children's penises off.
[01:25:03.468 --> 01:25:06.430]  Oh, no, that's openly, publicly the government and the system.
[01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:07.972]  No, I'm not doing any of that.
[01:25:08.612 --> 01:25:09.993]  And I sure as hell ain't perfect.
[01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:12.235]  But the other day, I love God and I love justice.
[01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:19.160]  And just because you guys twist a bunch of crap and make a bunch of stuff about Elon Musk or Donald Trump or Alex Jones, the dog ain't hunting.
[01:25:26.698 --> 01:25:29.080]  We've reached the halfway point in today's transmission.
[01:25:30.321 --> 01:25:32.243]  It's Friday, August 16th, 2024.
[01:25:33.404 --> 01:25:35.205]  The world is changing.
[01:25:36.366 --> 01:25:42.231]  The globalist system is now attacking humanity as their program has come to an end.
[01:25:52.698 --> 01:25:55.540]  A digital frontier.
[01:25:56.401 --> 01:26:01.765]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[01:26:02.585 --> 01:26:03.686]  What do they look like?
[01:26:04.287 --> 01:26:04.627]  Ships?
[01:26:04.807 --> 01:26:07.049]  Motorcycles?
[01:26:07.349 --> 01:26:09.030]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[01:26:11.552 --> 01:26:14.854]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[01:26:14.934 --> 01:26:15.995]  And then, one day,
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.361]  He's got in.
[01:26:22.441 --> 01:26:23.662]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:26:23.682 --> 01:26:25.724]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, a good friend of mine, a really smart guy, is our guest.
[01:26:41.874 --> 01:26:43.215]  And I'm just going to put this right up front.
[01:26:43.355 --> 01:26:51.919]  If I owned a restaurant, I would want to have the best, most delicious, healthy food at the most affordable prices where I got the biggest crowds in.
[01:26:52.299 --> 01:26:53.440]  So you had a great experience.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.422]  You want to come back a hundred times and I make money and I'm successful.
[01:26:56.922 --> 01:26:57.782]  You have a great time.
[01:26:57.982 --> 01:26:58.803]  You get treated right.
[01:26:58.983 --> 01:26:59.663]  I get treated right.
[01:26:59.983 --> 01:27:00.644]  That's a community.
[01:27:01.664 --> 01:27:02.345]  So let's say it again.
[01:27:03.325 --> 01:27:04.686]  People really responded to this truth.
[01:27:06.445 --> 01:27:07.565]  I've been on there 30 years.
[01:27:07.665 --> 01:27:11.226]  I've had gold sponsors for 28 years as sponsors.
[01:27:12.007 --> 01:27:12.827]  Only two companies.
[01:27:12.967 --> 01:27:22.929]  Because if you want a numismatic, they'd sell it to you, but they would try to sell you gold and silver bullion with, you know, 10% markup or whatever to pay their bills and do it.
[01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:23.990]  And that's very fair.
[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:25.530]  You can barely do it.
[01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:32.092]  I don't know how Kirk does it at 8% with his crew and everything and the quality and the marketing, but he does it.
[01:27:33.328 --> 01:27:39.735]  So he's paying for marketing and running his crew and doing all this stuff for 8% and no charge to sell it back.
[01:27:39.815 --> 01:27:40.636]  Everybody else does that.
[01:27:42.614 --> 01:27:43.714]  It's such a good deal.
[01:27:43.734 --> 01:27:45.995]  It's very frustrating.
[01:27:46.355 --> 01:27:48.116]  I know we have millions of people watching every hour.
[01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:49.556]  And a lot of folks are calling.
[01:27:49.576 --> 01:27:51.017]  He's getting thousands of calls when he comes on.
[01:27:51.037 --> 01:27:51.457]  That's great.
[01:27:52.217 --> 01:27:53.738]  But it needs to be tens of thousands of calls.
[01:27:53.758 --> 01:27:56.259]  I mean, this is so simple.
[01:27:56.679 --> 01:28:01.721]  In a world of fiat, you at least want to have a hedge that's in silver and gold.
[01:28:02.101 --> 01:28:08.203]  And if you look at what's happening, I am only going to try to push something that I believe I would personally do.
[01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:10.398]  We're good to go.
[01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:31.854]  It is a no-brainer to call them, do a consultation, and get into silver right now.
[01:28:31.994 --> 01:28:34.997]  And if you want some gold, you know, maybe get an 80% silver, get some gold.
[01:28:35.017 --> 01:28:35.918]  But I think he's dead on.
[01:28:35.938 --> 01:28:38.300]  I don't think, I know, you want to be all silver.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.522]  Because then that's what's going to go up, obviously.
[01:28:40.542 --> 01:28:41.442]  That's what's undervalued.
[01:28:41.703 --> 01:28:44.905]  But you get the gold once it skyrockets, which is already happening.
[01:28:44.925 --> 01:28:47.888]  So you need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:28:47.908 --> 01:28:49.129]  That's Kirk Elliott Pressure Metals.
[01:28:49.429 --> 01:28:51.130]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:52.592]  And then, of course, there's the support.
[01:28:53.666 --> 01:28:56.789]  Or you can call 720-605-3900.
[01:28:56.849 --> 01:29:06.637]  And listen, if enough of you went there, because he does his sponsorship off of what percentage he gets, we could get reporters back, expand, do anything.
[01:29:07.438 --> 01:29:10.240]  I mean, already, we would not be on air right now if it wasn't for his sponsorship.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.942]  He takes us over the top to be in the black.
[01:29:12.322 --> 01:29:14.083]  Not much, but a little bit.
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.502]  And so I appreciate the crew staying with us through all this hell.
[01:29:17.582 --> 01:29:18.262]  It's been wild.
[01:29:18.622 --> 01:29:21.044]  We're still here by the grace of God, but you need to support this sponsor.
[01:29:21.344 --> 01:29:22.245]  It supports what we're doing.
[01:29:22.325 --> 01:29:25.266]  Plus, it's the best deal, the best company, the highest ratings.
[01:29:25.386 --> 01:29:26.087]  It's so simple.
[01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:27.948]  Call him now.
[01:29:27.968 --> 01:29:29.469]  720-605-300.
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:35.473]  And he's got, what is it, close to 100, you know, experts there, but you'd probably be talking to him as well.
[01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:38.234]  You need to make the call right now.
[01:29:38.254 --> 01:29:39.555]  He's got so many great services.
[01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:40.636]  Take action now.
[01:29:41.036 --> 01:29:45.361]  All right, shifting gears out of that, it's just that this is such a simple no-brainer decision in my view.
[01:29:45.381 --> 01:29:56.913]  The economy, the world, the Ukrainians 12 days ago with NATO funding invading Russia, all the other economic numbers, the contagion, they're trying to sweep it under the rug.
[01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:58.875]  What's the next shoe to drop in the economy?
[01:29:58.895 --> 01:30:02.780]  And you're going to have the floor now, so tell us what's... You've got the floor, go ahead.
[01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:08.387]  I mean, the next shooter drop is the debt implosion that we're going to see.
[01:30:08.407 --> 01:30:10.068]  So I just read this article this morning.
[01:30:10.088 --> 01:30:11.989]  It's called America.
[01:30:12.069 --> 01:30:17.292]  What we're witnessing are the classic final stages of a massive bubble right before it collapses.
[01:30:17.312 --> 01:30:18.453]  I mean, that's the title, right?
[01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:22.495]  So what is going to cause our economy to collapse?
[01:30:22.555 --> 01:30:25.997]  We are committing national suicide economically.
[01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:26.978]  It's debt.
[01:30:27.438 --> 01:30:30.040]  So how much debt are we gobbling up?
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.522]  So, $196 billion in new debt every single month.
[01:30:34.923 --> 01:30:36.523]  Every single month.
[01:30:36.984 --> 01:30:37.524]  Every single day, $6.4 billion.
[01:30:38.164 --> 01:30:39.925]  Every single hour, $268 million.
[01:30:39.945 --> 01:30:40.666]  Every minute, $4.5 million.
[01:30:41.126 --> 01:30:42.807]  Every second, we're adding $74,000 worth of debt.
[01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.534]  I mean, this is insane, right?
[01:30:53.574 --> 01:30:57.717]  So it's like, man, how are we going to keep this under control?
[01:30:58.298 --> 01:31:02.241]  We're not, because it's absolutely spinning out of control.
[01:31:02.641 --> 01:31:07.945]  The homelessness in America is now growing at 10% annually since COVID.
[01:31:08.305 --> 01:31:14.429]  So now you're going to have to have more expenditures going out to pay for them, to find a place to live or do whatever they're going to do, right?
[01:31:14.829 --> 01:31:16.751]  We're spending like drunken sailors.
[01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:18.532]  Our debt is accelerating.
[01:31:18.632 --> 01:31:20.794]  So with all of this debt,
[01:31:21.394 --> 01:31:25.181]  I mean, I saw you had that article on there about the bankruptcies, right?
[01:31:25.802 --> 01:31:31.872]  So our bankruptcies in America are at an absolute 13-year high.
[01:31:35.261 --> 01:31:36.502]  So what was 13 years ago?
[01:31:36.522 --> 01:31:39.924]  2008-2009, that crisis, right?
[01:31:40.524 --> 01:31:46.427]  So the number of bankruptcies under Chapter 11 jumped to 2,462.
[01:31:47.427 --> 01:31:58.332]  So Chapter 11 involves, as you know, sadly, court-supervised reorganization that allows a company to stay in business, but they basically sell off everything.
[01:31:58.492 --> 01:32:01.634]  And then we've also got a record credit card delinquency.
[01:32:02.691 --> 01:32:06.952]  Yeah, so highest rate of bankruptcies in 13 years, Alex.
[01:32:07.412 --> 01:32:12.713]  Next one, credit card delinquencies also at a 13-year high.
[01:32:13.593 --> 01:32:20.115]  Delinquencies rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities are at an 11-year high.
[01:32:20.595 --> 01:32:25.616]  Commercial real estate is going to be the kiss of death to the banking system.
[01:32:25.956 --> 01:32:27.116]  I mean, the collapse of it.
[01:32:27.176 --> 01:32:30.137]  I mean, so when we talk about what comes next,
[01:32:30.757 --> 01:32:31.057]  We're good.
[01:32:31.198 --> 01:32:44.412]  This debt that we're seeing, the absolute implosion of commercial real estate and all of the loans that our banks in America have in commercial real estate, you're going to see those delinquencies, right?
[01:32:44.512 --> 01:32:47.235]  And their delinquencies are going to end up in default.
[01:32:47.676 --> 01:32:49.658]  Banks are already undercapitalized.
[01:32:49.958 --> 01:33:02.043]  You know, I talked about this, I don't know, it was a few shows ago that we did, so maybe a month, month and a half ago, where I said, I think that the banking system is going to be the spark that causes this market mayhem.
[01:33:02.464 --> 01:33:04.765]  I do think that we're going to have a massive banking failure.
[01:33:04.785 --> 01:33:06.485]  You're seeing banking failures in China.
[01:33:06.785 --> 01:33:08.406]  We saw what happened in Japan.
[01:33:08.866 --> 01:33:12.748]  We are going to see it here because of commercial real estate.
[01:33:12.888 --> 01:33:14.329]  I believe that that's the spark.
[01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:22.597]  So now the banking system is even in more upheaval because people aren't working, right?
[01:33:22.617 --> 01:33:26.282]  So people have to work to deposit money into the banks.
[01:33:26.442 --> 01:33:27.583]  That's common sense.
[01:33:28.284 --> 01:33:31.367]  However, banks, people aren't working right now.
[01:33:31.688 --> 01:33:35.832]  So the jobs numbers, this is the lies coming from the Biden administration, right?
[01:33:35.872 --> 01:33:35.972]  So
[01:33:36.733 --> 01:33:44.176]  So whenever you get a jobs report, it's like one of the most watched economic reports that people follow to talk about the economy.
[01:33:44.757 --> 01:33:51.339]  They look at these job reports and they say, and always, always it's a lie, like 100% of the time.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.482]  So they've got this weird job report, and you're looking around and it's like, what?
[01:33:56.502 --> 01:33:58.623]  I can't believe that all these people are working.
[01:33:58.663 --> 01:33:59.904]  Where did all these jobs come from?
[01:34:00.464 --> 01:34:02.845]  And so they always beat expectations, right?
[01:34:03.265 --> 01:34:12.230]  And Wall Street responds well, and then a month later, like literally almost 100% of the time, they revise those numbers down.
[01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:19.514]  They revised the numbers down practically around the same day that they say, ooh, we beat expectation on jobs again.
[01:34:19.834 --> 01:34:21.015]  We're growing the economy.
[01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:23.516]  This is Biden's amazing plan for America.
[01:34:24.056 --> 01:34:29.699]  Well, the same day, they revised the numbers downward from the month before.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.082]  And by the way, I don't need to be an economist, Kirk, to just interrupt for a minute and give you the floor again.
[01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:37.104]  Our audience is back to where it was in 2016.
[01:34:37.524 --> 01:34:39.245]  We're reaching 30 million people a day conservatively.
[01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:42.657]  When Trump was in office, we would have plenty of funds.
[01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:46.000]  Our audience is bigger than ever, but the funds aren't there.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.402]  And everybody I talk to in business is having the same thing.
[01:34:48.822 --> 01:34:49.302]  Restaurants.
[01:34:49.322 --> 01:34:54.066]  I went to a restaurant that's been around for 10 years, last night, with my family.
[01:34:54.967 --> 01:34:58.290]  And I got there at 7 o'clock, and usually you have to get a reservation.
[01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.431]  We just walked in, because we know.
[01:34:59.771 --> 01:35:01.993]  And there was like 5 tables out of 30 filled.
[01:35:02.734 --> 01:35:04.936]  And the parking garage was empty.
[01:35:05.556 --> 01:35:07.558]  I mean, I'm supposedly in a boom town.
[01:35:10.365 --> 01:35:11.906]  I mean, you're right.
[01:35:12.126 --> 01:35:13.647]  People don't have money.
[01:35:13.887 --> 01:35:15.828]  The audience might be massive.
[01:35:16.329 --> 01:35:23.093]  But you look around, and people are living in America mostly hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck.
[01:35:23.173 --> 01:35:25.014]  That's all the numbers this year.
[01:35:25.434 --> 01:35:28.036]  Like, 69% are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
[01:35:29.039 --> 01:35:33.002]  Yeah, this is America, the land of opportunity, Alex.
[01:35:33.062 --> 01:35:41.569]  But we've turned into, under Biden, we've turned into basically the U.S.S.A., right?
[01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:46.873]  All of our ideals and everything that we had in that White House— Hang on, I'm going to stop and shut up for 10 minutes, but you're there.
[01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:50.837]  What do you make of Kamala claiming she's going to do all these Trump things?
[01:35:51.437 --> 01:35:53.979]  Well, I think she's stealing Trump's thunder because Trump has good ideas.
[01:35:54.019 --> 01:35:56.321]  And she wants to say, look, I'm doing the same thing that Trump is.
[01:35:56.361 --> 01:35:56.641]  Right.
[01:35:56.721 --> 01:35:58.142]  But but she's not going to.
[01:35:58.162 --> 01:35:58.282]  Right.
[01:35:58.302 --> 01:36:00.964]  But but let's just say that she did when she adds all of this to her absolute communist ideas.
[01:36:21.178 --> 01:36:25.580]  Kamala Harris is a communist.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.321]  You've talked about this even on today's show.
[01:36:28.441 --> 01:36:35.583]  When you put price controls on food, saying Americans, they can't afford to buy groceries anymore.
[01:36:35.743 --> 01:36:41.105]  Well, yeah, because of your stupid policies in your administration, printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:41.946]  That's inflation.
[01:36:42.026 --> 01:36:42.786]  You caused it.
[01:36:43.246 --> 01:36:47.629]  So now she's saying, we got to put price controls on it so people can afford to eat.
[01:36:48.009 --> 01:36:50.091]  And then what's going to happen to the manufacturers?
[01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:58.296]  She had more teeth to that statement saying, if you don't manufacture food at these prices, well, then you're going to get penalized from it and you're going to get fined.
[01:36:58.636 --> 01:37:02.039]  Well, what she's going to do is cause companies just simply go out of business.
[01:37:02.579 --> 01:37:06.522]  What she is going to do is going to cause empty store shelves.
[01:37:07.222 --> 01:37:08.283]  There's not going to be food.
[01:37:08.303 --> 01:37:10.404]  There's going to be massive food shortages, right?
[01:37:10.824 --> 01:37:13.306]  So then she wants to have this child tax credit.
[01:37:13.766 --> 01:37:15.227]  Well, that's going to cost a ton of money.
[01:37:15.567 --> 01:37:18.749]  She's capping prices for Medicare and Medicaid, right?
[01:37:18.869 --> 01:37:20.630]  And as they should.
[01:37:20.650 --> 01:37:23.092]  I mean, pharmaceutical prices are absolutely through the roof, right?
[01:37:23.452 --> 01:37:28.035]  But it's not because sometimes these places are price gouging.
[01:37:28.415 --> 01:37:31.637]  It's because of the policies coming out of D.C.
[01:37:31.997 --> 01:37:35.079]  that cause inflation, that cause everything to go through the roof.
[01:37:35.539 --> 01:37:42.444]  So part of it is she's doing all this stuff that's communist, and it's going to cost so much money to do.
[01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:51.270]  So now she has to backpedal a little bit and say, ooh, what Trump is doing, we can't let him be the only person that actually cares for people.
[01:37:51.710 --> 01:38:01.777]  We're going to give people these child tax credits, and we're going to do this, and we're going to give them a $25,000 reduction gift on their down payment when they buy their first home.
[01:38:02.417 --> 01:38:04.659]  Where's all this money going to come from?
[01:38:05.539 --> 01:38:06.600]  Where's it going to come from?
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.083]  Because under Trump's plan, he wants to get it from tariffs on imported goods.
[01:38:12.684 --> 01:38:17.587]  And that'll detract people from buying foreign goods, bring jobs back to America.
[01:38:17.947 --> 01:38:19.888]  More people are going to be spending money.
[01:38:19.908 --> 01:38:23.771]  And when more people spend money, the government is going to actually
[01:38:24.611 --> 01:38:28.853]  Do well with property tax revenues and all of these things.
[01:38:29.454 --> 01:38:38.878]  But if Trump gets his way and eliminates income taxes and replaces that with tariffs on foreign goods, that is the best of the best, right?
[01:38:38.918 --> 01:38:42.780]  Because you diminish demand for foreign goods, increase demand for American goods.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.641]  People are working, people are spending.
[01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:45.642]  This is amazing.
[01:38:46.262 --> 01:38:48.965]  What Kamala is doing is the opposite.
[01:38:49.405 --> 01:38:56.492]  She's just going to spend money that they have to print out of thin air because her policies will not create jobs, they'll reduce jobs.
[01:38:56.912 --> 01:39:05.680]  But I think even she knows, I've got to mimic Trump in some of these statements because they're actually good ideas and I want those votes, right?
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.642]  So she's just an absolute liar, right?
[01:39:08.682 --> 01:39:09.803]  But Communism 101.
[01:39:11.753 --> 01:39:16.136]  When you put price caps on food, that is communism.
[01:39:16.537 --> 01:39:19.799]  And what she's trying to do here is rewrite history.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:24.143]  She's actually trying to rewrite history in the sense of
[01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:36.135]  When the Biden administration has pursued for several years to target corporate consolidation and price gouging, now, she is absolutely a radical, right?
[01:39:36.595 --> 01:39:44.879]  And I have a feeling, though, that like Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals is ruling the day in all of these decisions, right?
[01:39:44.939 --> 01:39:49.481]  And she's trying to rewrite history that couldn't be written before.
[01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:50.582]  We're good.
[01:40:19.821 --> 01:40:20.442]  We're good to go.
[01:40:36.752 --> 01:40:38.013]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:38.073 --> 01:40:41.736]  I mean, this is so Hegelian.
[01:40:42.176 --> 01:40:55.267]  You know, if you want a policy done and nobody votes for it, well, you create a problem that's so bad that now people say, OK, your policy is probably pretty good now because the alternative of not taking your policy is economic collapse.
[01:40:55.287 --> 01:40:59.230]  You know, the emperor has no clothes, whatever you want to call it, and people realize it.
[01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:02.772]  What they're doing is creating crisis that's so bad
[01:41:03.593 --> 01:41:10.379]  That people will give up their freedoms in exchange for perceived security and peace, right?
[01:41:10.899 --> 01:41:15.884]  So what we're seeing here is all of these things happening all at once.
[01:41:15.944 --> 01:41:20.087]  And behind the scenes, you see the solution, their solution.
[01:41:20.768 --> 01:41:28.912]  You know, being being prepared behind the scenes, which is like central bank digital currency, the ability to control your buying and selling.
[01:41:28.952 --> 01:41:29.112]  Right.
[01:41:29.152 --> 01:41:32.333]  So we've talked about that a ton over the last 10 months.
[01:41:32.854 --> 01:41:42.018]  But the BRICS nations now, their their alternative currency, their their CBDC is near realization.
[01:41:42.538 --> 01:41:46.821]  And the American empire, basically, the death is imminent.
[01:41:47.822 --> 01:41:56.429]  And that's what makes NATO move missiles up to the Russian border and blow up the Nord Stream pipeline, which they did, and fund Ukraine invading Russia.
[01:41:56.449 --> 01:41:58.531]  This is all just pure threats and desperation.
[01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:00.832]  Absolutely.
[01:42:00.912 --> 01:42:05.474]  And so there's this guy, he's a Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.
[01:42:05.835 --> 01:42:13.439]  He said recently that the BRICS countries are developing a payments platform that will allow them to absolutely simply bypass the U.S.
[01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:13.819]  dollar.
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:24.446]  So that initiative was actually exposed in August of last year at the BRICS summit in Durban, South Africa.
[01:42:25.146 --> 01:42:27.568]  Right, so they don't hide things anymore.
[01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:28.269]  Right, Alex?
[01:42:28.749 --> 01:42:34.313]  You know, these conspiracy theories that people talk about, it's like, ooh, they're all cloaked in the shadows and they're using code words.
[01:42:34.373 --> 01:42:42.240]  No, now they have WFUN summits called World Government, and they say, you're gonna eat bugs, there'll be world government, we're gonna track everything you do.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.381]  They're just out in the open now.
[01:42:44.962 --> 01:42:45.442]  Why are they?
[01:42:45.462 --> 01:42:47.664]  Because they know the old system's coming to an end.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.621]  Yeah, and they know that people will give up their freedoms if a crisis is bad enough.
[01:42:52.641 --> 01:42:54.662]  So they're just saying what they're going to do.
[01:42:55.262 --> 01:42:57.382]  They're going to strip away our freedoms.
[01:42:57.822 --> 01:42:59.643]  They're going to cause collapse.
[01:42:59.683 --> 01:43:01.443]  There is going to be a pandemic.
[01:43:01.483 --> 01:43:03.104]  They already know the diseases, right?
[01:43:03.164 --> 01:43:06.465]  And, you know, this monkeypox or avian flu.
[01:43:07.285 --> 01:43:07.985]  They're telling us.
[01:43:08.326 --> 01:43:13.048]  They're telling us what is going to happen, and then people are shocked when it happens?
[01:43:13.168 --> 01:43:21.372]  It's like, are people becoming so blind that they'll just listen to mainstream media and take it hook, line, and sinker?
[01:43:21.392 --> 01:43:21.872]  No, no, they're not.
[01:43:21.892 --> 01:43:22.973]  So how do we counter this?
[01:43:24.053 --> 01:43:29.419]  So you counter that, at least financially, by getting out of the system, right?
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:37.729]  You have to get out of this central bank digital currency, digital system, the ability to cut you off from buying or selling tangible assets like gold and silver, number one, right?
[01:43:37.849 --> 01:43:38.390]  Financially.
[01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:41.133]  We're just talking about the financial piece here, right?
[01:43:41.533 --> 01:43:43.575]  But there's other things that you can do.
[01:43:44.296 --> 01:43:47.197]  And so, like, silver for barter, that's amazing.
[01:43:47.758 --> 01:43:54.020]  If the currency collapses and you can't use it, you better have something that's small, valuable, portable that you can trade back and forth.
[01:43:54.661 --> 01:44:03.505]  How do you get out of a system that where, you know, do you feel like you have too much in different asset categories?
[01:44:03.765 --> 01:44:04.345]  Do you feel it?
[01:44:04.785 --> 01:44:07.026]  And if you do, then do something about it.
[01:44:07.126 --> 01:44:10.968]  I would reallocate into something that's growing, like precious metals.
[01:44:11.308 --> 01:44:12.869]  So that's the financial piece of it.
[01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:13.449]  Now,
[01:44:13.929 --> 01:44:18.270]  Outside of that, we're entering into an era of massive food shortages.
[01:44:18.771 --> 01:44:20.251]  Kamala's stupid policy.
[01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:22.932]  I mean, so these are the policies.
[01:44:22.992 --> 01:44:25.053]  We don't have to wait for her to become president, right?
[01:44:25.093 --> 01:44:27.573]  Because she's the vice president now, right?
[01:44:27.913 --> 01:44:30.554]  So she's just mouth-piecing what they're probably doing.
[01:44:31.154 --> 01:44:39.517]  So when you have these kind of policies, inflationary pressures, and manufacturers can't afford to keep manufacturing, we're going to have food shortages.
[01:44:39.557 --> 01:44:41.738]  So you better have something in store
[01:44:42.778 --> 01:44:49.502]  In case there's food shortages, fresh water, make sure that you're healthy, like what you talk about all the time, right?
[01:44:49.602 --> 01:44:50.883]  With the supplements that you sell.
[01:44:51.503 --> 01:45:05.090]  Our bodies are so out of whack because of the unhealthy food that we eat, the unhealthy lifestyle that we have, the stress that causes your body to start to deteriorate.
[01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:06.691]  You've got to take care of your body.
[01:45:06.791 --> 01:45:07.371]  You've got to find faith.
[01:45:07.391 --> 01:45:08.192]  You've got to, you know,
[01:45:10.673 --> 01:45:11.853]  Reach out for Jesus, right?
[01:45:11.993 --> 01:45:13.694]  And God will protect you.
[01:45:13.734 --> 01:45:16.474]  He will be the peace in the midst of this storm, right?
[01:45:16.494 --> 01:45:17.734]  So we have to find faith.
[01:45:18.314 --> 01:45:19.695]  We have to rely on it.
[01:45:19.775 --> 01:45:22.155]  We have to act on it, right?
[01:45:22.195 --> 01:45:26.596]  We have to allocate into tangible assets like gold and silver.
[01:45:26.656 --> 01:45:28.556]  You have to have food supplies.
[01:45:28.956 --> 01:45:32.317]  You have to have a community of like-minded people around you.
[01:45:32.877 --> 01:45:36.678]  See, when I come on and talk about the economics, it's not just that.
[01:45:37.518 --> 01:45:44.681]  There's way more to not just surviving in this world, but thriving in this world that we can do.
[01:45:45.101 --> 01:45:47.923]  And it's so much more than just gold and silver.
[01:45:47.983 --> 01:45:48.943]  It absolutely is.
[01:45:49.423 --> 01:45:52.665]  And you better stink and get out there and vote, right?
[01:45:52.725 --> 01:45:58.407]  Because this is where, and a lot of times, a lot of these policies come from state levels.
[01:45:58.447 --> 01:46:03.510]  So talk to your state politicians, your state legislators, because they're going to be more responsible than the national ones.
[01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:04.330]  Well, that's what globalists always say.
[01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:05.591]  They go, think global, act local.
[01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:06.111]  We've got to do that.
[01:46:07.336 --> 01:46:07.997]  Absolutely.
[01:46:08.577 --> 01:46:17.963]  And so all of this comes full circle when our... everything that we're seeing, Alex, to me is a physical manifestation of a spiritual battle that we're seeing.
[01:46:18.624 --> 01:46:18.784]  Right?
[01:46:18.824 --> 01:46:25.649]  You can... I mean, I've seen, you know, Naomi Wolf on your show talking about... I was about to say, she's a huge former liberal.
[01:46:25.689 --> 01:46:26.549]  She's totally awake now.
[01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:28.010]  Yeah.
[01:46:28.091 --> 01:46:29.612]  She's like, no, I'm not committing suicide.
[01:46:29.632 --> 01:46:30.692]  The Democratic Party's pure evil.
[01:46:30.732 --> 01:46:31.233]  I'm against it.
[01:46:31.733 --> 01:46:32.774]  She sounds like Alex Jones.
[01:46:34.161 --> 01:46:44.784]  I mean, and she's a good friend, and what she's saying is so bold and so courageous, just like you, and everything that we're seeing has these, and Maria Z. as well, right?
[01:46:45.044 --> 01:47:00.668]  There's so much satanic elements that are surrounding all of these decisions, and we're just seeing the physical manifestations of these things happening, and so that is why faith is such an important deal, so you can have wisdom and discernment.
[01:47:01.488 --> 01:47:05.973]  Then family, community, and then you need the water filtration, the food, the guns, the silver, the gold.
[01:47:06.593 --> 01:47:07.554]  And it's just real simple.
[01:47:07.574 --> 01:47:08.415]  I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[01:47:08.475 --> 01:47:13.000]  I feel like I'm here pushing this because I believe it, but it's so obvious.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.985]  I mean, if people 10 months ago when you first came on would have listed you with silver and gold, how much is it up in 10 months?
[01:47:19.426 --> 01:47:21.148]  Well, oh my goodness.
[01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:24.071]  I mean, so silver is up, well, it's up
[01:47:25.177 --> 01:47:26.638]  Over 30% in five months.
[01:47:26.678 --> 01:47:34.203]  I mean, we're probably, I don't know, 10 months ago, but we're probably up well over 50% in that timeframe.
[01:47:34.403 --> 01:47:35.544]  I have an easy job.
[01:47:35.984 --> 01:47:37.365]  Tell the truth, get it right.
[01:47:38.145 --> 01:47:39.786]  And I just want to get it right folks.
[01:47:39.826 --> 01:47:40.747]  And we're getting it right again.
[01:47:40.907 --> 01:47:42.628]  I'm just saying it's so dumb not to call you.
[01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.829]  Yeah.
[01:47:44.909 --> 01:47:47.031]  I mean, I would call, you know,
[01:47:48.405 --> 01:47:49.446]  We have to act.
[01:47:49.526 --> 01:47:56.389]  People complain, you know, that their lives are falling apart, that they don't have money, but yet they're afraid to act, right?
[01:47:56.429 --> 01:48:00.571]  So it's like, well, I thought about it, and I wish I would have done something.
[01:48:01.011 --> 01:48:05.113]  You know, at some point, you just have to take responsibility for your own actions.
[01:48:05.673 --> 01:48:08.275]  You always have to take responsibility for your own actions.
[01:48:08.695 --> 01:48:09.695]  But just act.
[01:48:10.075 --> 01:48:10.456]  Call.
[01:48:11.076 --> 01:48:12.056]  We're not scary.
[01:48:12.216 --> 01:48:13.937]  We will walk you through this, right?
[01:48:14.237 --> 01:48:16.899]  We want to educate, empower, equip you.
[01:48:16.919 --> 01:48:17.539]  But it's so easy!
[01:48:17.799 --> 01:48:18.360]  It's so easy.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.561]  I need to give you a call right now.
[01:48:19.581 --> 01:48:20.663]  720-605-3900.
[01:48:20.783 --> 01:48:24.147]  Governor Kerr Gelliott, incredible interview.
[01:48:24.207 --> 01:48:25.909]  Thanks for all your expertise and your support.
[01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:27.331]  You're welcome.
[01:48:27.471 --> 01:48:28.132]  We'll talk soon.
[01:48:28.472 --> 01:48:30.655]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:48:31.676 --> 01:48:33.598]  Of all the safest bets, none is perfect in this world.
[01:48:34.625 --> 01:48:35.726]  Alex Jones here with a call of action.
[01:48:35.786 --> 01:48:40.668]  A call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:48:40.688 --> 01:48:42.649]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:48:53.354 --> 01:48:59.881]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:48:59.901 --> 01:49:03.565]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:49:03.946 --> 01:49:10.092]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:49:11.013 --> 01:49:19.697]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[01:49:19.877 --> 01:49:28.982]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.483]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:30.543 --> 01:49:31.603]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:49:32.003 --> 01:49:32.924]  It is very, very popular.
[01:49:33.504 --> 01:49:35.245]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:49:35.445 --> 01:49:42.347]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:49:42.807 --> 01:49:46.849]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:49:47.049 --> 01:49:51.130]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:49:51.650 --> 01:49:59.393]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:50:00.474 --> 01:50:01.294]  And they kicked him back.
[01:50:02.569 --> 01:50:06.172]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:50:06.472 --> 01:50:17.541]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:50:18.141 --> 01:50:26.569]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:50:27.049 --> 01:50:37.278]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable, sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[01:50:37.679 --> 01:50:39.180]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:41.342]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:41.422 --> 01:50:42.023]  It's got the little
[01:50:42.643 --> 01:50:43.804]  Bar of gold in there.
[01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:46.965]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:50:47.265 --> 01:50:53.308]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:50:53.328 --> 01:50:54.988]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:50:55.368 --> 01:50:59.190]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:00.851]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:51:01.511 --> 01:51:04.413]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:51:04.974 --> 01:51:07.976]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:51:08.336 --> 01:51:13.200]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:15.682]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:51:16.462 --> 01:51:22.447]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:51:22.467 --> 01:51:23.067]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:51:23.648 --> 01:51:25.829]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:51:25.849 --> 01:51:26.570]  That's not what this is.
[01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:27.691]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:51:28.271 --> 01:51:41.379]  This is like, on NPR, that still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug to cost them five dollars, or a baseball cap to cost them ten dollars, and you make a hundred dollar donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the new world order.
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.580]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:51:43.301 --> 01:51:49.925]  This costs, I think they told me, more than ten dollars per card, something like that, ten or eleven dollars, and so the other
[01:51:50.742 --> 01:51:53.664]  $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:51:53.704 --> 01:51:56.867]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:51:57.387 --> 01:52:05.073]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:52:05.434 --> 01:52:06.535]  The decision is yours.
[01:52:06.555 --> 01:52:07.956]  This is a limited edition.
[01:52:08.596 --> 01:52:12.940]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:23.929]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:52:24.289 --> 01:52:33.177]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:52:33.577 --> 01:52:34.438]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:34.798 --> 01:52:36.440]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:52:50.501 --> 01:52:54.204]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:52:54.944 --> 01:52:58.887]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:52:59.687 --> 01:53:03.530]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:07.692]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:53:09.354 --> 01:53:20.640]  But at least once you figure it out, then you can turn it around.
[01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:23.602]  Once everybody knows.
[01:53:24.543 --> 01:53:25.663]  Everybody knows!
[01:53:27.124 --> 01:53:34.048]  Eh, not all the leftists yet, but I'd say 60% of people have got a good idea now.
[01:53:35.911 --> 01:53:36.671]  And we're turning things around.
[01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:39.752]  That's why they're talking about martial law and civil war and killing everybody.
[01:53:40.412 --> 01:53:41.133]  I got a better idea.
[01:53:41.153 --> 01:53:41.873]  How about we don't do that?
[01:53:43.773 --> 01:53:45.834]  But man, I tell you, Naomi Wolf was on again yesterday.
[01:53:45.954 --> 01:53:48.495]  She got shut down on X with a hack attack.
[01:53:48.775 --> 01:53:50.716]  And I've got to make some phone calls and try to help her.
[01:53:50.736 --> 01:53:51.496]  I haven't done that yet.
[01:53:51.556 --> 01:53:53.056]  But they haven't restored her account yet.
[01:53:53.096 --> 01:53:53.897]  She's frozen out of it.
[01:53:54.477 --> 01:53:57.078]  But she warns we are already under martial law.
[01:53:57.898 --> 01:54:00.179]  Foreign armies are already operating inside the United States.
[01:54:01.299 --> 01:54:04.500]  And she's a former, you know, mainline Democrat Party high-level operative.
[01:54:05.683 --> 01:54:06.263]  She's right.
[01:54:07.524 --> 01:54:09.724]  The video's on Infowars.com, Global Bombshell.
[01:54:11.125 --> 01:54:13.646]  Naomi Wolf Warren's, we're already under martial law.
[01:54:14.506 --> 01:54:17.047]  They're already installed Kamala.
[01:54:17.127 --> 01:54:17.987]  That's martial law.
[01:54:18.007 --> 01:54:20.969]  They already liquefied the border of human trafficking outside of law.
[01:54:21.009 --> 01:54:21.689]  That's martial law.
[01:54:21.969 --> 01:54:23.449]  Martial law is when they don't follow law.
[01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:29.832]  You think of martial law as soldiers running down the street, that's the classic form, but that's like 1% of it.
[01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:42.237]  So this is happening, this is going on, and, you know, NATO funding and endorsing attacks on Russia, and an invasion of Russia, I mean, last time that happened was 1942.
[01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:47.721]  When was Barbarossa, was it 42 or 43?
[01:54:47.941 --> 01:54:51.063]  I think it was, look up Operation Barbarossa, when did Hitler launch that?
[01:54:51.303 --> 01:54:52.284]  Late 42, early 43?
[01:54:52.524 --> 01:54:58.047]  The point is, is that this, this is, this stuff's so huge,
[01:54:59.161 --> 01:55:00.721]  That I'm like, can't believe I'm even reporting it.
[01:55:01.382 --> 01:55:03.162]  I mean, this is like cuckoo land.
[01:55:04.623 --> 01:55:07.303]  And the head of Google, or former head of Google, oh, I'm a weapons dealer.
[01:55:07.343 --> 01:55:10.724]  We're creating combat robots to station them everywhere and protect you.
[01:55:12.345 --> 01:55:15.286]  Gosh, Sunday, 22nd, June 41.
[01:55:15.426 --> 01:55:16.906]  He launched earlier than I thought.
[01:55:17.206 --> 01:55:18.367]  See, my memory's failing, folks.
[01:55:20.127 --> 01:55:22.408]  So, there you go.
[01:55:23.248 --> 01:55:24.409]  Can't even get my dates right anymore.
[01:55:25.529 --> 01:55:25.709]  So,
[01:55:27.349 --> 01:55:32.930]  We're taking first-time callers today on all the political issues.
[01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:35.531]  The attempted Trump assassination, we're going to keep on the front burner.
[01:55:36.251 --> 01:55:44.153]  The Kamala Harris stealing all of Trump's economic platforms, but obviously should never implement them.
[01:55:45.874 --> 01:55:47.974]  Ukraine invading Russia 12 days ago.
[01:55:49.255 --> 01:55:53.636]  The monkey pox being declared, but since that didn't work last year, they call it M-pox.
[01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:56.290]  What do we do?
[01:55:56.531 --> 01:55:58.471]  How do we stand up against this peacefully?
[01:55:58.511 --> 01:55:59.412]  How do we change this?
[01:56:00.052 --> 01:56:01.973]  Because it's clear the enemy is going for broke.
[01:56:02.533 --> 01:56:03.913]  We are in cuckoo land.
[01:56:04.154 --> 01:56:06.134]  We are in the world of cuckoo clocks.
[01:56:06.975 --> 01:56:08.395]  We're the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[01:56:08.435 --> 01:56:10.476]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[01:56:10.576 --> 01:56:12.877]  Even mainline analysts say most dangerous point in human history.
[01:56:13.317 --> 01:56:15.138]  This is crazy town.
[01:56:16.158 --> 01:56:22.681]  And the bankers that have run the country in the ground, they don't want to go to jail like Bernie Madoff because they're running a Ponzi scheme a thousand, ten thousand times bigger.
[01:56:23.891 --> 01:56:31.875]  So they plan on civil unrest and disruption, and a crash they blame on a hack attack or monkey pox or something so they don't get the blame.
[01:56:31.895 --> 01:56:34.456]  Well, they need to get the blame up front, then they'll back off.
[01:56:34.977 --> 01:56:37.358]  But if they're not in the hot seat, they'll do anything.
[01:56:38.298 --> 01:56:39.259]  Polls, remember to join us.
[01:56:39.279 --> 01:56:39.319]  877-789-2539.
[01:56:39.339 --> 01:56:39.479]  877-789-Alex.
[01:56:39.499 --> 01:56:39.539]  877-789-2539.
[01:56:49.815 --> 01:57:07.443]  Your calls, first-time callers on these issues interspersed with a bunch of breaking news and information in the next hour ahead of the amazing bestselling author and researcher and expert on the New World Order, Jay Dyer, who just basically reads out of their own publications and documents and books for an hour.
[01:57:08.363 --> 01:57:14.606]  You want to get real clear information broken down by an expert of the enemy operation?
[01:57:15.868 --> 01:57:16.769]  He's got their playbook.
[01:57:17.129 --> 01:57:21.393]  That is in T-minus 55 minutes, 30 seconds from now.
[01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:23.195]  But you're stuck with me!
[01:57:24.256 --> 01:57:24.896]  As they say.
[01:57:25.857 --> 01:57:27.479]  I'm not locked in here with you.
[01:57:27.519 --> 01:57:28.820]  You're locked in here with me.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.441]  Ha ha ha!
[01:57:31.342 --> 01:57:32.443]  Don't know how to quit.
[01:57:32.944 --> 01:57:33.905]  Don't know how to fail.
[01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:35.211]  Because of God.
[01:57:35.251 --> 01:57:35.771]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:36.312 --> 01:57:36.792]  All right.
[01:57:36.912 --> 01:57:38.574]  I'm going to go to your phone calls here in a moment.
[01:57:39.174 --> 01:57:41.096]  And I really don't want to do this to you.
[01:57:41.777 --> 01:57:42.738]  I don't want to do it myself.
[01:57:42.878 --> 01:57:44.199]  Rob did put this together yesterday.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:47.002]  It's gotten millions of views on X. The real Alex Jones.
[01:57:48.143 --> 01:57:54.169]  This is a small sampling of Kamala Harris doing her insane cackling witch thing.
[01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:55.531]  Her war cry.
[01:57:57.328 --> 01:58:03.453]  But again, folks, I've seen a lot of movies that people can play good witches, like Wizard of Oz.
[01:58:03.993 --> 01:58:09.097]  I can make a pretty evil laugh, but I kind of turn on some evil parts of my brain to do it.
[01:58:09.738 --> 01:58:10.879]  I do it kind of as a joke sometimes.
[01:58:10.939 --> 01:58:11.859]  It freaks out my family.
[01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:17.704]  You don't get a laugh this fake or this evil without having a demon in there.
[01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:22.147]  I mean, this woman's beyond an empty suit.
[01:58:22.167 --> 01:58:22.868]  She's an empty soul.
[01:58:24.588 --> 01:58:30.351]  So I'm going to subject you to this, because this needs to go even more viral, so we can think about who this woman is.
[01:58:30.371 --> 01:58:32.092]  And we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:58:32.773 --> 01:58:34.214]  So, viewer discretion is advised.
[01:58:34.254 --> 01:58:35.314]  You want to tune out for three minutes?
[01:58:35.754 --> 01:58:45.660]  Because three minutes of her cackling is... In fact, I'm probably going to turn my headset off, my earpiece off during this, because I... I do put this out yesterday afternoon.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.141]  I saw it.
[01:58:46.221 --> 01:58:47.181]  I watched it again this morning.
[01:58:47.221 --> 01:58:48.342]  I was like, what am I doing?
[01:58:48.402 --> 01:58:50.923]  But at the same time, it's so evil, you got to show it.
[01:58:50.943 --> 01:58:53.245]  I mean, she might as well be riding a broom, folks.
[01:58:53.265 --> 01:58:53.625]  Here it is.
[01:58:57.355 --> 01:58:58.736]  Poor hubby.
[01:58:58.776 --> 01:58:59.456]  Poor hubby.
[01:59:24.408 --> 01:59:30.556]  She knows how to sell right there, okay.
[01:59:42.469 --> 01:59:44.471]  She's still got a sense of humor.
[01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:44.691]  Right?
[02:00:04.415 --> 02:00:21.589]  Okay now because you'll need some help maybe maybe you can have maybe you can have um
[02:00:34.153 --> 02:00:34.413]  Alright.
[02:00:34.614 --> 02:00:35.654]  You look fantastic!
[02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:36.735]  No, maybe, maybe...
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:11.182]  So, let's do this!
[02:01:15.764 --> 02:01:19.467]  I mean, she could not be more... Rob just ran out of the studio.
[02:01:20.127 --> 02:01:21.508]  She could not be more fake.
[02:01:21.568 --> 02:01:22.948]  She could not be more disgusting.
[02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:25.910]  She could not be more disingenuous.
[02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:28.872]  Rob just ran in here and just yelled, this is torture.
[02:01:30.213 --> 02:01:31.313]  In fact, that should be the name of the video.
[02:01:31.353 --> 02:01:32.013]  This is torture.
[02:01:32.093 --> 02:01:33.294]  And I had to air it.
[02:01:34.114 --> 02:01:36.615]  But I mean, where do you find somebody like this?
[02:01:36.695 --> 02:01:38.115]  Who can come up with a laugh like that?
[02:01:38.135 --> 02:01:40.135]  I mean, that's like nails on a chalkboard.
[02:01:40.175 --> 02:01:41.516]  And then everything she does is a fake.
[02:01:41.916 --> 02:01:42.876]  Everything she does is a fraud.
[02:01:42.936 --> 02:01:44.757]  And this is who they want to force-feed to us?
[02:01:45.497 --> 02:01:46.797]  These people are crazy.
[02:01:48.678 --> 02:01:50.358]  They're absolutely insane.
[02:01:51.178 --> 02:01:52.358]  And she wants price controls.
[02:01:52.398 --> 02:01:54.039]  Yeah, let's actually hear Aina laugh.
[02:01:54.079 --> 02:01:54.359]  Here it is.
[02:01:56.448 --> 02:01:57.368]  Poor hubby.
[02:01:57.408 --> 02:01:58.229]  Poor hubby.
[02:02:29.687 --> 02:02:33.048]  But that's the thing is, she's obviously has psychosis.
[02:02:33.068 --> 02:02:34.848]  She's completely bonkers.
[02:02:36.289 --> 02:02:36.829]  Bonkers.
[02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:41.290]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:45.911]  We got Jim, Aaron, Robert, Gary, Andrew, Bill, Robin, James, Mike.
[02:02:45.931 --> 02:02:47.311]  I'm going to take your calls in order to receive.
[02:02:47.331 --> 02:02:49.252]  Aaron wants to talk from Tennessee.
[02:02:49.272 --> 02:02:53.133]  Aaron wants to talk about monkey pox and the new COVID and all the hype.
[02:02:53.193 --> 02:02:53.533]  Go ahead.
[02:02:56.254 --> 02:02:57.114]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:02:57.762 --> 02:03:00.244]  Yeah, I'm sorry to subject you to that, but it has to be put on record.
[02:03:02.205 --> 02:03:02.806]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[02:03:03.246 --> 02:03:03.867]  Yes, I can.
[02:03:03.967 --> 02:03:04.627]  Welcome, Aaron.
[02:03:04.647 --> 02:03:05.408]  Can you hear me?
[02:03:05.788 --> 02:03:06.469]  Can you hear me?
[02:03:06.489 --> 02:03:07.930]  Yes, brother.
[02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:08.750]  It's a blessing to be here.
[02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:09.831]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:03:10.011 --> 02:03:10.191]  Welcome.
[02:03:10.211 --> 02:03:15.796]  I'm really nervous right now, but I called in randomly, and thank the Lord for getting me through.
[02:03:15.956 --> 02:03:21.140]  I work at Bush Bean, the factory here, and, man, people's not awake here.
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.183]  I have two of the friends listening to you all the time, like I do, and it's a blessing.
[02:03:25.802 --> 02:03:30.907]  I think if we do what we did last fall and they try to come out with the COVID again, we speak out about it, it's going to shut them down again.
[02:03:30.927 --> 02:03:31.147]  I agree.
[02:03:31.167 --> 02:03:33.729]  That's what we can do, brother.
[02:03:33.749 --> 02:03:34.850]  But they're trying again.
[02:03:35.211 --> 02:03:36.011]  What does that tell you?
[02:03:52.486 --> 02:03:52.866]  No, I agree.
[02:03:52.886 --> 02:03:54.788]  So you see a lot of people dying from the shots?
[02:04:22.478 --> 02:04:22.738]  I'm sorry.
[02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:38.143]  Well, it's a fact.
[02:04:38.183 --> 02:04:40.445]  They hit us with a weapon because America tried to wake up.
[02:04:40.485 --> 02:04:41.305]  We tried to have Trump.
[02:04:41.865 --> 02:04:43.586]  And they said, we'll just give you a bioweapon attack.
[02:04:43.686 --> 02:04:45.287]  And that's what they did with the poison shots.
[02:04:45.688 --> 02:04:46.608]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[02:04:46.648 --> 02:04:47.489]  Thank you for calling, Aaron.
[02:04:48.049 --> 02:04:50.470]  Let's go to Robert in Florida on the Trump assassination, the U.N.
[02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:52.451]  invasion, which the U.N.
[02:04:52.491 --> 02:04:53.552]  officials are calling for U.N.
[02:04:53.592 --> 02:04:54.472]  troops in America, by the way.
[02:04:54.492 --> 02:04:56.453]  If you're a new listener, I can't believe they even did it.
[02:04:56.534 --> 02:04:57.314]  It's actually happening.
[02:04:57.354 --> 02:04:57.654]  Go ahead.
[02:04:59.275 --> 02:05:04.558]  Alex, I believe all the immigrants that are coming, or excuse me, illegal aliens that are coming over.
[02:05:05.171 --> 02:05:08.334]  Wearing the designer boots that all match are the U.N.
[02:05:08.394 --> 02:05:08.874]  soldiers.
[02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:10.595]  I know you spoke about this before.
[02:05:10.616 --> 02:05:12.237]  Well, I mean, I've looked at their bearing.
[02:05:12.277 --> 02:05:13.518]  There's no doubt they're soldiers.
[02:05:14.719 --> 02:05:16.380]  Yeah, they're going to come in the middle of the night.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.642]  You're going to wake up and they're going to be rampant in the street.
[02:05:19.303 --> 02:05:24.867]  They're going to shut everything down, just like your, uh, Damion Wolf said that they extended the Emergency Act.
[02:05:25.187 --> 02:05:26.468]  This has all been pre-planned.
[02:05:26.508 --> 02:05:28.830]  They're not going to allow this to, uh, fail.
[02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:30.512]  They're going to do whatever it takes to get to that point.
[02:05:30.532 --> 02:05:32.994]  And they're going to claim it's right-wingers blowing everything up when it happens.
[02:05:34.042 --> 02:05:49.245]  Exactly, and then those prisoners that were released that they did a negotiation with, turns out one of them was the head sniper recruiter for the CIA, so it's kind of miraculous that he's got out just in time for the new DNC convention that's going to happen.
[02:05:49.265 --> 02:05:59.487]  There'll be a Trump supporter waving his hat and screaming whatever and do whatever, but there's false flags coming down the pipeline big time, and we just need to wake up.
[02:05:59.507 --> 02:06:00.288]  You can feel it.
[02:06:00.368 --> 02:06:02.048]  You can politically and culturally
[02:06:03.314 --> 02:06:04.414]  See it as an intellectual.
[02:06:04.995 --> 02:06:09.616]  But when you just feel the sense of urgency, do you feel it?
[02:06:10.817 --> 02:06:11.457]  Absolutely.
[02:06:11.837 --> 02:06:28.163]  I just, I was just at a, I'm in Florida and I was at a polling station and I had to go in and drop some paperwork for work and I hear Republicans arguing with each other that one person copied their this and that and the other and it's disgusting to me that people can't figure this out.
[02:06:28.803 --> 02:06:31.824]  It's not about the right and the left paradigm, it's about life.
[02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:35.011]  Freedom of choices, freedom of happiness.
[02:06:35.051 --> 02:06:46.557]  You're set on this earth to do one thing, and I've got four kids and a family to feed, and I've got these people arguing, you know, 75-year-old men arguing with each other on who's what and what.
[02:06:46.617 --> 02:06:49.218]  It's like, you know, the Republicans are lazy.
[02:06:49.238 --> 02:06:50.859]  They don't want to get up and do anything.
[02:06:50.919 --> 02:06:57.983]  They let the Democrats go, the Liberals go and pick up the school boards and everything else, and we wonder why we're in the mess that we're in.
[02:06:58.581 --> 02:07:00.703]  But I don't think anything's going to happen.
[02:07:00.723 --> 02:07:02.985]  These people out here say, you gotta vote, you gotta vote.
[02:07:03.265 --> 02:07:05.227]  They stole it second term of Obama.
[02:07:05.247 --> 02:07:08.310]  They stole it almost against Trump in the beginning.
[02:07:08.710 --> 02:07:09.871]  Then they stole it with Biden.
[02:07:09.891 --> 02:07:13.974]  You don't think they've got it figured out now where they're not going to worry about having to steal it?
[02:07:14.015 --> 02:07:15.476]  They'll just shut everything down.
[02:07:16.056 --> 02:07:21.221]  And I think on the monkey pop thing, this is a reaction from the COVID shot.
[02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:22.402]  This is part of it.
[02:07:23.417 --> 02:07:25.680]  Oh absolutely, absolutely.
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:43.179]  I mean we know from the epidemiologists and virologists and scientists and pathologists you've had on and all the statistics and the research that when you give people this type of injection while they're already sick it creates all these insane mutations not just of that virus but everything else.
[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:52.245]  That's what they always said for decades, you can't give somebody a shot for the cold because it's such a wide spectrum of viruses, it will create a super virus.
[02:07:52.725 --> 02:07:59.869]  And so yeah, people are like, I even saw some comments on X, like Jones is saying there's lots of illness and death and weird viruses, he's fear mongering.
[02:07:59.929 --> 02:08:02.871]  I'm not agreeing with the UN, I'm seeing the numbers.
[02:08:04.452 --> 02:08:08.576]  I'm seeing illnesses all over the people I know, all over Austin, all over the country.
[02:08:08.936 --> 02:08:10.197]  Weird stuff going on, man.
[02:08:10.437 --> 02:08:15.922]  I mean, since when do we have all these hospitalizations in the summer for colds and flus?
[02:08:16.543 --> 02:08:18.565]  Something weird's going on.
[02:08:18.585 --> 02:08:29.154]  Absolutely, and I hope and pray one day you get to sit and enjoy your family with no stress and you'll be able to relax one day because you've well done your part and woken people up.
[02:08:29.254 --> 02:08:30.215]  I myself had to
[02:08:30.657 --> 02:08:41.124]  I paid for an abortion before I knew anything, and I've repented for it, and I think God put you in a position that you are paying for your mistakes, and you are waking a lot of people up.
[02:08:41.205 --> 02:08:41.945]  It's not just you.
[02:08:41.965 --> 02:08:46.268]  It's the message that you sent that is happening now, and it's happening so fast.
[02:08:46.308 --> 02:08:53.794]  Some people aren't ready for it, and they say, you know, men's hearts will fail them when the truth comes out, and that's, you know, that's biblical.
[02:08:53.814 --> 02:08:57.036]  So people want to turn a blind eye and not help, you know?
[02:08:57.506 --> 02:09:00.207]  I always tell people, if you're being attacked, don't yell help.
[02:09:00.287 --> 02:09:01.107]  Yell fire.
[02:09:01.147 --> 02:09:02.107]  Everyone runs for help.
[02:09:02.507 --> 02:09:03.967]  Everybody comes running for fire.
[02:09:04.848 --> 02:09:05.648]  God bless you, sir.
[02:09:05.748 --> 02:09:06.448]  Yeah.
[02:09:08.128 --> 02:09:11.469]  Every time I tell the story, the left writes a news article saying Jones is a hypocrite.
[02:09:11.829 --> 02:09:15.710]  He admits he funded abortions when he was a teenager, but now he's against it.
[02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:19.671]  Well, it's like saying I'm committed to murder, which I did, and then I learned it was wrong.
[02:09:19.851 --> 02:09:20.471]  I mean, what?
[02:09:21.471 --> 02:09:23.472]  Or you're an alcoholic and you stop and admit it was wrong.
[02:09:25.836 --> 02:09:27.637]  I mean, I repented of that when I was about 18.
[02:09:28.917 --> 02:09:29.517]  When I was 18.
[02:09:29.817 --> 02:09:33.159]  And then that began my journey in God's calling.
[02:09:33.699 --> 02:09:37.760]  And when I was about 21, that's when God literally came into the room.
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:39.041]  I didn't see God, but I could feel it.
[02:09:39.901 --> 02:09:43.422]  And it was like, will you say you want to make good for what you did?
[02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:50.905]  And it was just, I was giving this whole download of the future, and it was just like, what?
[02:09:51.585 --> 02:09:52.506]  Is this actually happening?
[02:09:52.526 --> 02:09:53.386]  I was like, yeah, watch.
[02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:56.152]  And it was literally like a contract.
[02:09:56.172 --> 02:09:58.214]  Spirits was like, shine right here.
[02:09:59.114 --> 02:10:00.976]  And I showed what it would be like.
[02:10:01.436 --> 02:10:03.358]  I've done this about 25 years, folks.
[02:10:03.938 --> 02:10:04.939]  And you saw it come true.
[02:10:04.959 --> 02:10:12.164]  I even had somebody I've known for 10 years, good friend, like, I saw your show the other day about how God came to you and all this.
[02:10:12.184 --> 02:10:12.965]  That sounds crazy.
[02:10:13.785 --> 02:10:15.466]  It's 25 years ago.
[02:10:16.027 --> 02:10:17.188]  I didn't tell the story for a few years.
[02:10:17.228 --> 02:10:18.689]  Something about 27, 28 years ago.
[02:10:19.630 --> 02:10:21.571]  And I've told the story 100 times, probably more.
[02:10:21.591 --> 02:10:22.251]  I'm not gonna tell it again.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:26.901]  It was just like the walls blew out of the building I was in.
[02:10:26.921 --> 02:10:30.202]  It was like, I was like, okay, uh, major presence.
[02:10:30.462 --> 02:10:33.643]  I, uh, I want to get down flat on my face, but I can't do it.
[02:10:33.663 --> 02:10:35.644]  I'm in a restaurant by myself at late at night.
[02:10:36.004 --> 02:10:36.764]  It's about to close.
[02:10:36.804 --> 02:10:37.565]  And I'm like, well, what?
[02:10:37.905 --> 02:10:38.105]  Okay.
[02:10:38.125 --> 02:10:38.845]  Well, what do you want?
[02:10:39.906 --> 02:10:40.426]  What is this?
[02:10:40.546 --> 02:10:41.826]  It was like download.
[02:10:41.846 --> 02:10:42.446]  Well, you did this.
[02:10:42.486 --> 02:10:42.887]  You did that.
[02:10:42.927 --> 02:10:44.487]  You said this, you've been doing good.
[02:10:44.547 --> 02:10:45.908]  You want to really do something?
[02:10:45.928 --> 02:10:47.568]  Well, first, let me show you what's going to happen.
[02:10:48.489 --> 02:10:49.569]  You say you want to help people, right?
[02:10:51.147 --> 02:10:51.828]  Say you love humanity.
[02:10:52.108 --> 02:10:53.789]  Well, this is what's going to happen to you if you do this.
[02:10:54.489 --> 02:10:55.710]  And it was bad.
[02:10:56.931 --> 02:10:59.593]  And then the next thing was, now you're ready.
[02:11:01.434 --> 02:11:03.335]  Do you actually want to do what you claim you want to do?
[02:11:04.196 --> 02:11:07.478]  And I said, no matter what, I pledge myself, I commit.
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:10.480]  Now give me the mission.
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:11.541]  It was like a hammer.
[02:11:12.281 --> 02:11:12.922]  Boom!
[02:11:15.383 --> 02:11:16.644]  And it's never been the same since.
[02:11:17.004 --> 02:11:20.367]  And I've had similar downloads that were different.
[02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:23.043]  And even more intense than that since then.
[02:11:24.023 --> 02:11:27.887]  And it's just like... It's happened a bunch last year.
[02:11:28.027 --> 02:11:29.648]  Like, I'll be going to bed at like 10.30 at night.
[02:11:30.989 --> 02:11:31.510]  Get in the bed.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.010]  It's all set.
[02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:38.836]  You feel like the presence is like... And it's like, always... It turns the tide, too.
[02:11:40.397 --> 02:11:41.538]  And then you see God working.
[02:11:41.598 --> 02:11:43.880]  It's like, wow, this is really real.
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.003]  Because your eyes, folks, only see a tiny bit of reality.
[02:11:47.023 --> 02:11:47.383]  You know that.
[02:11:48.004 --> 02:11:49.045]  We're like blind, basically.
[02:11:49.793 --> 02:11:53.134]  And there's everything going on all around us, and God is 100% real.
[02:11:54.254 --> 02:12:07.477]  And God has even told me in the last year or so, look, you've done your mission.
[02:12:07.537 --> 02:12:08.357]  I said this about two years ago.
[02:12:08.417 --> 02:12:09.717]  I said, I've completed my primary mission.
[02:12:10.138 --> 02:12:11.278]  And Jack Pacific retweeted it.
[02:12:11.378 --> 02:12:11.958]  It went viral.
[02:12:14.068 --> 02:12:17.511]  But then I said, well, I was like, well, you've completed the mission.
[02:12:17.531 --> 02:12:18.892]  You can stop now if you want.
[02:12:18.912 --> 02:12:20.913]  Of course, God knows everything.
[02:12:20.953 --> 02:12:21.674]  It's not going to happen.
[02:12:21.694 --> 02:12:23.415]  I was like, well, what about my children?
[02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.256]  Everybody else is down.
[02:12:24.276 --> 02:12:24.876]  He goes, that's right.
[02:12:24.896 --> 02:12:28.379]  You're not fighting now for the children you killed to save the other children.
[02:12:28.739 --> 02:12:29.880]  Now you're fighting for your children.
[02:12:32.562 --> 02:12:33.903]  And then the new mission began.
[02:12:35.724 --> 02:12:40.528]  And the left, you know, really gets upset when I say this, but I've been commissioned by God.
[02:12:42.684 --> 02:12:44.591]  I said 25 years ago.
[02:12:44.652 --> 02:12:45.595]  We found the clubs that played them.
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:51.121]  Imagine, like, you feel the presence in this room out of nowhere.
[02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:56.242]  I'm just sitting there drinking iced tea, eating a chicken fried steak, like, whoa, whoa, what's this, what's going on?
[02:12:56.622 --> 02:13:05.224]  And God's like, you're going to ignite the global resistance, you're going to go through hell, and you're going to be absolutely demonized and attacked everywhere, on every channel, everywhere.
[02:13:05.264 --> 02:13:09.585]  And here's the different scenarios that could happen, depending on how people respond, but they go from bad to worse.
[02:13:10.145 --> 02:13:12.885]  And I went on air and said, I was just told all this.
[02:13:12.905 --> 02:13:15.746]  And back then I was on a local radio station in Access Television.
[02:13:16.431 --> 02:13:18.513]  And it all happened, and I'm on record saying it.
[02:13:19.734 --> 02:13:22.777]  I mean, this is like next level, folks.
[02:13:22.797 --> 02:13:23.718]  This is so real.
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.864]  The experiences since then, I just get quiet and focus on God.
[02:13:30.785 --> 02:13:32.587]  I know what the enemy's gonna do next.
[02:13:32.687 --> 02:13:33.768]  I see around corners.
[02:13:33.828 --> 02:13:34.369]  God does.
[02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:38.032]  And it's not me.
[02:13:38.172 --> 02:13:38.913]  I'm just a receiver.
[02:13:39.814 --> 02:13:40.414]  A transceiver.
[02:13:41.554 --> 02:13:43.575]  And I could talk all day about this.
[02:13:43.695 --> 02:13:44.716]  It's just incredible.
[02:13:45.276 --> 02:13:47.397]  And so people say, man, we appreciate going through all this.
[02:13:47.557 --> 02:13:50.819]  I'm like, actually, this is a real blessing.
[02:13:51.699 --> 02:13:53.040]  I mean, it's physically not fun.
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:54.000]  The flesh doesn't like it.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:54.741]  The spirit does.
[02:13:54.801 --> 02:13:57.542]  So I'm in a whole nother dimension now.
[02:13:58.142 --> 02:14:00.043]  I really have transcended.
[02:14:00.864 --> 02:14:02.885]  And the problem is, is that now
[02:14:04.716 --> 02:14:08.300]  It's very saddening to see people not understand how real God is and how real the spiritual realm is.
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:13.425]  This third dimension is a reflection of the spiritual dimension that is the real dimensions.
[02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:15.146]  Like, that's real.
[02:14:15.246 --> 02:14:17.028]  This is just a reflection or a shadow.
[02:14:17.809 --> 02:14:19.931]  This is just a little side thing.
[02:14:20.912 --> 02:14:26.477]  And I just really, like Christ said, Father forgive them, they know not what they do.
[02:14:26.497 --> 02:14:28.839]  I read those passages now and it's like,
[02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:35.859]  I mean, like, these people that serve evil think they're winners because they're doing all this bad stuff, and they really think they're in charge.
[02:14:35.879 --> 02:14:42.224]  They're all puffed up, and they love award ceremonies and kissing each other's asses, and you're just looking at losers.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:45.026]  You're just looking at scum.
[02:14:45.846 --> 02:14:48.028]  I mean, the creator of the universe don't like you.
[02:14:48.929 --> 02:14:50.350]  I'm not scared of you guys, man.
[02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:53.172]  You globalists, like, think you mess with me and attack me.
[02:14:53.212 --> 02:14:55.673]  It has zero effect now.
[02:14:56.710 --> 02:15:04.279]  I only think about, am I living up to what I'm supposed to do, because I am—you know, when you read the Bible, it talks about God fearing.
[02:15:04.299 --> 02:15:05.500]  It translates into Greek and Hebrew.
[02:15:05.901 --> 02:15:11.927]  It doesn't mean you hate God or you don't like God or you're scared of God, like God's cancer or heart attack or car wreck.
[02:15:11.968 --> 02:15:14.711]  No, it's like you're scared of not being with God.
[02:15:16.049 --> 02:15:16.689]  You're scared.
[02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:22.193]  I mean, imagine the greatest girlfriend or wife, you know, the person you love so much that you're scared they'll leave you.
[02:15:22.213 --> 02:15:23.074]  You love them so much.
[02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:31.760]  You're so attracted to them that even though they're happy and you're secure, you're still having concern because you love them so much.
[02:15:32.361 --> 02:15:33.682]  Imagine that times a thousand.
[02:15:35.287 --> 02:15:36.428]  That's why I could never sell out.
[02:15:36.788 --> 02:15:42.912]  I mean, if I even comprehend selling out, and I'm not even thinking about it, but the human brain war game says, well, what if I did sell out?
[02:15:42.932 --> 02:15:43.732]  What would that be like?
[02:15:43.752 --> 02:15:44.493]  What would that look like?
[02:15:45.033 --> 02:15:50.256]  And just even that degree of contemplation, God begins to be removed.
[02:15:50.436 --> 02:15:54.679]  You're like, oh, oh, no, no, no.
[02:15:54.739 --> 02:15:55.439]  That's the fear.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.321]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:57.401 --> 02:15:58.321]  I'm not even thinking about it.
[02:15:58.541 --> 02:15:59.482]  I wasn't contemplating it.
[02:15:59.702 --> 02:16:00.202]  I won't do it.
[02:16:00.423 --> 02:16:00.843]  I promise.
[02:16:00.863 --> 02:16:01.223]  Please, please.
[02:16:03.144 --> 02:16:04.005]  Hey Gary, how we doing?
[02:16:04.025 --> 02:16:04.945]  Alright Alex, how we doing?
[02:16:28.453 --> 02:16:31.135]  So, I have a question for you.
[02:16:31.155 --> 02:16:32.376]  I also have a statement.
[02:16:32.456 --> 02:16:44.967]  First question would be, everybody's, you know, we're worried about the big scale, the big picture, but I have always found that the best way to work on things is at the local level.
[02:16:44.987 --> 02:16:53.074]  You know, start in your own home, then you work to your neighborhood, and then you work to your community, and then that, you know, eventually goes to scale.
[02:16:54.236 --> 02:16:57.659]  What would be your, you know, kind of pro-tip towards that?
[02:16:57.819 --> 02:17:18.455]  And then the statement I had would be, you have all across the board, in every nation right now, you have a growing, not even a growing populace, but a group of people that are controlling the things that happen, the globalists.
[02:17:18.955 --> 02:17:21.638]  And there's... The technocrats.
[02:17:22.665 --> 02:17:42.502]  Yeah, the technocrats, the globalists, but you also, with that, you have people like Rhonda Massey, who is the spouse of Thomas Massey, who comes out and says, AIPAC controls our politicians, the bureaucratic institutions through funding to their campaign, whatever it may be.
[02:17:43.723 --> 02:17:46.746]  I have people that are, you know, I have friends all over the world.
[02:17:49.731 --> 02:17:51.932]  I truly believe in things like what MLK says.
[02:17:52.012 --> 02:17:56.693]  I believe by judging people by their constant character, not their color, race, creed, orientation, or whatever.
[02:17:57.113 --> 02:18:04.936]  I've met good people and bad people on both sides, regardless of what, you know, their view may be.
[02:18:05.496 --> 02:18:18.140]  But you have a foreign nation that is operating within our country doing things to dismantle our way of thinking, to dismantle the way that we feel about our neighbors and about our country.
[02:18:20.947 --> 02:18:28.051]  It's a massive problem that needs to be addressed, but you can't address it without looking like, you know, you're using, you know, whatever words they want to use to describe you.
[02:18:28.071 --> 02:18:32.334]  You're using anti-Semitic dog whispers, or you're this, that, and a third.
[02:18:33.955 --> 02:18:38.717]  That, you know, when you look to who controls, you look to who you can't criticize, and I
[02:18:40.126 --> 02:18:44.389]  I see that issue being skirted a lot by... Yeah, no, I don't skirt any of it.
[02:18:44.409 --> 02:18:49.111]  I mean, there's no doubt that Israel and its different lobbies are one of the most powerful lobbying groups.
[02:18:49.151 --> 02:18:53.114]  You've got the Federal Reserve and you've got the military-industrial complex and the teachers' unions.
[02:18:53.134 --> 02:18:56.696]  But, I mean, Israel's right up there in the top two or three, and I criticize it.
[02:18:57.116 --> 02:19:03.620]  I don't apportion magical powers to it and say it's the dominant force, but clearly
[02:19:04.622 --> 02:19:05.683]  We're good to go.
[02:19:25.347 --> 02:19:31.233]  And so I can just get everybody to oppose the Global Cashless Society or Drag Queen Storytime, whether it's BlackRock or whoever's funding it.
[02:19:31.594 --> 02:19:36.339]  We just oppose it instead of getting sucked down into the weeds about AIPAC.
[02:19:36.359 --> 02:19:38.261]  I mean, I see AIPAC as what it is.
[02:19:38.321 --> 02:19:39.942]  It's a mafia, you know, just like
[02:19:42.008 --> 02:19:42.768]  I don't know what's her name.
[02:19:42.788 --> 02:19:46.429]  Naomi Wolf said, she's Jewish, she said, we have corporate mafias.
[02:19:46.449 --> 02:19:46.909]  The U.S.
[02:19:46.949 --> 02:19:48.090]  government, the Democrats are mafias.
[02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:49.390]  She'll tell you Israel's a mafia.
[02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:51.050]  And so it's just mafias.
[02:19:51.090 --> 02:19:53.991]  So I don't blame the Jewish mafia for Jews.
[02:19:54.631 --> 02:19:55.991]  And so I just remove it from that.
[02:19:56.031 --> 02:19:56.652]  But stay there.
[02:19:56.672 --> 02:19:57.692]  I want you to finish your point, Gary.
[02:19:58.372 --> 02:20:00.893]  But I mean, look, look, AIPAC is the Jewish mafia.
[02:20:00.933 --> 02:20:01.933]  So let's just be honest about it.
[02:20:02.313 --> 02:20:03.314]  How's it going, Harrison?
[02:20:03.374 --> 02:20:04.694]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:20:04.714 --> 02:20:06.135]  You guys have the best crew.
[02:20:06.455 --> 02:20:07.656]  You guys are awesome.
[02:20:07.716 --> 02:20:09.097]  Just wanted to plug real quick.
[02:20:09.297 --> 02:20:16.961]  Just recently found out after 14 years, I got a quarter or half of my muscle torn off from my shoulder blade, right?
[02:20:17.001 --> 02:20:19.182]  So I've been in constant pain for years.
[02:20:19.642 --> 02:20:24.445]  And the turmeric, the nitric boost, the fish oil, everything.
[02:20:24.745 --> 02:20:28.590]  If I don't take it, dude, I'm totally feeling it and I'm on the floor.
[02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:32.774]  This is one of the only things is your products that gets me going.
[02:20:32.915 --> 02:20:36.318]  It's helping me and I've been in pain for 14 years.
[02:20:36.659 --> 02:20:38.201]  You guys gotta try some of it.
[02:20:38.441 --> 02:20:38.761]  Wow.
[02:20:39.082 --> 02:20:39.802]  It's true, folks.
[02:20:39.843 --> 02:20:41.725]  You hear people call in like this all the time.
[02:20:42.005 --> 02:20:43.926]  We got plenty of people out there to bash Israel all day.
[02:20:43.967 --> 02:20:44.087]  And
[02:21:07.659 --> 02:21:13.382]  You know, I made the decision very early on to not try to make the show about that.
[02:21:13.643 --> 02:21:15.484]  So we have a caller call, and we'll go back to Gary in a minute.
[02:21:16.264 --> 02:21:21.727]  And he's very serious, but he's coming to this big subject like it's the big taboo.
[02:21:22.828 --> 02:21:26.611]  If we just talk about this, this will somehow stop the New World Order.
[02:21:27.251 --> 02:21:44.823]  Do you understand it's declassified in the mainstream, Haaretz, Jerusalem Post, that starting in 47, Israel did bombings in Iraq and in Spain and a bunch of other countries to blow up Jews and blame it on other groups to make Jews move to Israel?
[02:21:47.486 --> 02:21:56.172]  Hitler, this is declassified, look it up, had a deal from the time he got in to make Jews move to Israel, and they had the top Jewish leaders involved in it.
[02:21:59.514 --> 02:22:01.695]  So what I'm saying is, I actually have studied history.
[02:22:02.316 --> 02:22:06.759]  The average Jew is like the average, you know, Muslim or Christian, has no idea what's even going on.
[02:22:07.399 --> 02:22:09.560]  So my job is not to be an apologist for Jews.
[02:22:09.861 --> 02:22:13.403]  I always see these jokes, you're paid by AIPAC, you work for the Jews and Mossad.
[02:22:13.663 --> 02:22:16.105]  Have you seen the ADL saying I'm the main enemy to shut down?
[02:22:18.899 --> 02:22:21.001]  The ADL is an evil mafia organization.
[02:22:21.962 --> 02:22:23.163]  They've hated me for 30 years.
[02:22:23.203 --> 02:22:24.484]  They've been attacking me for almost 30 years.
[02:22:26.049 --> 02:22:36.452]  But they really don't like me because I'm not going to drive Jews into their arms by saying Jews are all evil and running around in some big conspiracy.
[02:22:37.232 --> 02:22:54.177]  But any powerful group or organization, especially persecuted groups, are going to get organized into groups, and those almost always get taken over by corrupt people, who then will persecute their own people or allow it to happen, like the Israeli stand-down on October 7th, as the pretext for political power.
[02:22:55.805 --> 02:23:02.749]  Netanyahu is like Macron, or Trudeau, or the new British Prime Minister.
[02:23:04.390 --> 02:23:07.752]  They all got 18, 20, 20% of the vote.
[02:23:08.592 --> 02:23:08.952]  All of them.
[02:23:10.914 --> 02:23:18.798]  The current British Prime Minister got 18%, Macron got 20%, Netanyahu got 20%, Trudeau got 20%.
[02:23:19.778 --> 02:23:22.660]  How are they the prime ministers or presidents with 20% of the vote?
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:24.001]  Because they have a parliament.
[02:23:25.452 --> 02:23:34.715]  Just like in Germany this week, the National Conservative Party joined with the Communist Socialist Party to outvote the new populist German party.
[02:23:36.516 --> 02:23:40.657]  So, you think here a two-party system is bad, it's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:23:42.298 --> 02:23:48.640]  Imagine you vote in a majority party and then there's a bunch of other parties and they combine with the party that lost and they're in charge.
[02:23:51.361 --> 02:23:53.162]  The current British Prime Minister doing all this tyranny
[02:23:57.048 --> 02:23:59.790]  Keir Starmer got 18%.
[02:24:01.391 --> 02:24:04.052]  So Netanyahu is unpopular.
[02:24:05.853 --> 02:24:06.914]  Trudeau is unpopular.
[02:24:06.954 --> 02:24:08.035]  Macron is unpopular.
[02:24:08.395 --> 02:24:09.335]  They're all unpopular.
[02:24:10.216 --> 02:24:11.356]  How are they staying in control?
[02:24:11.417 --> 02:24:16.119]  So, I mean, Netanyahu used Israel as a guinea pig for the poison shots.
[02:24:16.139 --> 02:24:17.880]  They've got just as high a death rate as anybody from him.
[02:24:19.101 --> 02:24:19.982]  So, to me,
[02:24:21.266 --> 02:24:26.091]  This giving magical powers to Jews and acting like they're one group.
[02:24:26.111 --> 02:24:32.618]  I mean, you know how much the liberal Jews hate the Orthodox Jews and all they fight with each other constantly over there.
[02:24:32.678 --> 02:24:35.741]  I mean, it's just it's because I study all these major countries.
[02:24:35.761 --> 02:24:40.026]  So I study it and I like to act like Israel's one big power block.
[02:24:41.090 --> 02:24:48.357]  Is just preposterous, but I'm all about exposing the USS Liberty in an attempt to sink the ship and blame Egypt in World War III.
[02:24:48.817 --> 02:24:49.538]  It happened.
[02:24:49.558 --> 02:24:54.882]  I interviewed the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, who was in charge at the time, who said LBJ called up and said, I want that goddamn ship at the bottom.
[02:24:56.204 --> 02:24:57.625]  I've been around 30 years on air, man.
[02:24:57.665 --> 02:24:58.986]  I've interviewed basically everybody.
[02:24:59.006 --> 02:25:05.292]  I interviewed LBJ's mistress that was, you know, there when he said, I'm going to kill that son of a bitch next week.
[02:25:07.569 --> 02:25:11.877]  So, I interviewed, had the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hoth that ran the assassination of Kennedy.
[02:25:12.197 --> 02:25:13.520]  I mean, I've been around the block, folks.
[02:25:15.623 --> 02:25:17.366]  So, here's a microcosm.
[02:25:18.048 --> 02:25:19.370]  Even Nick Fuentes was on two weeks ago.
[02:25:20.427 --> 02:25:22.788]  And he's like, you know, Israel connection to Kennedy.
[02:25:22.828 --> 02:25:26.730]  And I went, you know, and he's actually very, very informed.
[02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:28.610]  You disagree with his views, but he's very smart.
[02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:29.671]  Historically, he's a smart guy.
[02:25:29.691 --> 02:25:30.831]  Like I know my stuff.
[02:25:30.851 --> 02:25:33.572]  That guy knows as much as I do on some cases more.
[02:25:33.953 --> 02:25:36.654]  I don't agree with all his views, but I mean, he's, he's not a fake intellectual.
[02:25:36.674 --> 02:25:37.394]  He's not stupid.
[02:25:38.766 --> 02:25:39.787]  He's like, no, I agree with you.
[02:25:39.847 --> 02:25:41.047]  The Italian mob was mad.
[02:25:41.067 --> 02:25:41.908]  The Pentagon was mad.
[02:25:41.948 --> 02:25:42.568]  He's pulling out.
[02:25:42.868 --> 02:25:43.949]  The Federal Reserve was pissed.
[02:25:44.009 --> 02:25:45.449]  A lot of interest wanted Kennedy killed.
[02:25:45.509 --> 02:25:47.330]  And Kennedy did tell Israel, you can't have nukes.
[02:25:47.951 --> 02:25:50.512]  And I'm told Israel did have a seat at the table in the decision.
[02:25:51.452 --> 02:25:53.193]  So it's more of a global council.
[02:25:53.213 --> 02:25:59.236]  You got the Chinese communists and the British royalty and the oil companies and the big banks and a bunch of those are Jews.
[02:25:59.797 --> 02:26:02.478]  And they shouldn't be holy cows that you don't touch.
[02:26:02.518 --> 02:26:07.400]  But because Rothschilds are Jews, you're like, well, the average Jew down the street, he's like in with the Rothschild.
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:08.141]  It's just not fair.
[02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:12.690]  So, I want to be a just person.
[02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:16.291]  And I want to really accuse people of what they've done.
[02:26:16.651 --> 02:26:18.472]  So I'll accuse individuals all day long.
[02:26:19.672 --> 02:26:20.393]  And I'll do that.
[02:26:21.653 --> 02:26:23.373]  But, I want to explain something again.
[02:26:24.514 --> 02:26:26.154]  It's baked in with the ADL.
[02:26:27.955 --> 02:26:30.376]  Isn't the ADL's pissed that anti-Semitism is at all-time highs?
[02:26:30.456 --> 02:26:31.916]  They're as happy as a pig and you know what?
[02:26:32.576 --> 02:26:33.817]  They're getting so much money right now.
[02:26:34.813 --> 02:26:42.415]  You think the Jewish mafia and it's the leadership, there's different power blocks, there's definitely multiple Jewish mafias.
[02:26:42.435 --> 02:26:46.096]  It's like there's a NATO mafia, you know, all of it.
[02:26:46.436 --> 02:26:47.837]  There's a Justice Department mafia.
[02:26:49.217 --> 02:26:50.618]  It's how the world works.
[02:26:50.638 --> 02:26:53.858]  Do you think they're mad Israel got attacks while they sit down?
[02:26:54.079 --> 02:26:56.219]  Do you think they're mad anti-Semitism is all denies?
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.980]  Israel has its own country with thousands of nuclear weapons.
[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:02.601]  They're not going anywhere.
[02:27:04.625 --> 02:27:10.990]  And if their leadership can get the world to attack them and give them a path for domination, they'll do it.
[02:27:11.611 --> 02:27:14.393]  So, it's like in War Games, a 1980s movie.
[02:27:14.413 --> 02:27:20.878]  In fact, get that little promo we cut, like, eight years ago already, where we predict the whole Ukraine war.
[02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:23.280]  It says, what a strange game.
[02:27:23.941 --> 02:27:25.702]  The only way to win is not to play.
[02:27:27.303 --> 02:27:30.006]  So, I don't drive by a synagogue and go, I hate those Jews.
[02:27:30.986 --> 02:27:33.208]  I don't drive by a black church, I hate those black people.
[02:27:33.248 --> 02:27:33.789]  I don't drive by
[02:27:35.346 --> 02:27:38.848]  But I understand the manipulation, the race baiting, the control.
[02:27:38.868 --> 02:27:42.650]  I understand the ADL is out there creating racial division and using it.
[02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:44.751]  They're basically like the KKK.
[02:27:46.933 --> 02:27:47.793]  So I don't like gangs.
[02:27:47.813 --> 02:27:48.694]  I don't like mafias.
[02:27:50.154 --> 02:27:53.116]  And there was a Southern Mafia until like the 70s.
[02:27:54.097 --> 02:27:56.918]  And the KKK was powerful and it was messing with people.
[02:27:57.398 --> 02:27:58.339]  And not just black people.
[02:27:58.379 --> 02:28:00.920]  They were pushing people around everywhere with businesses and stuff.
[02:28:01.681 --> 02:28:02.601]  But they got destroyed.
[02:28:02.641 --> 02:28:03.642]  They don't even exist anymore.
[02:28:05.265 --> 02:28:09.587]  So, I want to see the ADL, like the KKK, discredited and done.
[02:28:10.427 --> 02:28:11.207]  I don't want them bombed.
[02:28:11.227 --> 02:28:11.947]  I don't want them shot.
[02:28:11.967 --> 02:28:12.628]  Any of that.
[02:28:12.908 --> 02:28:14.328]  But I know they lie about me.
[02:28:14.488 --> 02:28:15.469]  And why do they not like me?
[02:28:15.829 --> 02:28:19.170]  Because a Jew can tune in here, or a Muslim, or a Christian.
[02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:20.571]  I'll shoot them straight what I really think.
[02:28:20.951 --> 02:28:22.751]  It's 100% how the world's going on.
[02:28:23.272 --> 02:28:25.832]  And I don't want to sit there and have some idiotic fight.
[02:28:27.433 --> 02:28:28.814]  But I can tell you one thing right now.
[02:28:30.114 --> 02:28:32.575]  You could teleport every Jew on Earth
[02:28:34.534 --> 02:28:37.477]  What, like 20-something million of them?
[02:28:37.818 --> 02:28:38.919]  How many Jews are there on Earth?
[02:28:38.939 --> 02:28:39.440]  Look at the number.
[02:28:40.861 --> 02:28:46.428]  You could teleport them to Mars, and do you think all our problems would be solved?
[02:28:46.888 --> 02:28:53.096]  This idea that Jews are the fountain of evil,
[02:28:55.014 --> 02:28:55.634]  No, we all are.
[02:28:56.215 --> 02:29:00.477]  We're the fountain of success, and God, and goodness, and success.
[02:29:01.217 --> 02:29:04.999]  We're all the fountain of betrayal, and failure, and evil, and greed, and murder.
[02:29:06.179 --> 02:29:07.280]  So just stop.
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:09.121]  Okay?
[02:29:09.721 --> 02:29:10.901]  I just want to cover issues.
[02:29:10.921 --> 02:29:13.102]  Don't tell the caller, stop, I'm glad he called, he can finish his points.
[02:29:14.663 --> 02:29:16.904]  It's just that people fetishize this stuff.
[02:29:17.164 --> 02:29:18.425]  And they also do it about Catholics.
[02:29:19.312 --> 02:29:21.353]  I mean, I can't tell you, I don't even look for these posts.
[02:29:21.393 --> 02:29:25.335]  Like, Jones is a Knight of Malta, and he works for the Vatican.
[02:29:25.415 --> 02:29:27.076]  That's another mentally ill thing.
[02:29:27.536 --> 02:29:28.757]  I don't hate the average Catholic.
[02:29:28.837 --> 02:29:30.218]  I don't like the current Catholic Pope.
[02:29:30.658 --> 02:29:34.480]  I think he's corrupt and bad, but I don't make it about some of the best people I know are Catholics.
[02:29:35.901 --> 02:29:37.762]  I know some great people that are Jews.
[02:29:38.342 --> 02:29:39.363]  Great people that are Protestants.
[02:29:39.823 --> 02:29:47.667]  But it's like, to call me a Knight of Malta, or a Mossad agent, I mean, my family on both sides, but particularly my mother's,
[02:29:49.369 --> 02:29:59.988]  In England, in the Netherlands, on the Mayflower, my dad's family too, but literally the group with the president a decade before the revolution in Texas
[02:30:01.209 --> 02:30:21.916]  Met with the President, met with Andrew Jackson in the mainline history books, sold everything they had in New York, bought chip loads of Bibles, Protestant Bibles, came here, had shootouts with Jesuit preached, set up Washington, Nebraska, East Texas, raised Colonel Travis's son, funded the troops, ran it, my mother's family literally was the detonator for the Texas Revolution.
[02:30:22.297 --> 02:30:23.397]  Hardcore Protestants.
[02:30:23.417 --> 02:30:25.278]  I mean, I come from Protestants, folks.
[02:30:25.798 --> 02:30:27.078]  As hardcore as you can get.
[02:30:27.598 --> 02:30:28.279]  Going back 400 years.
[02:30:31.097 --> 02:30:36.158]  450.
[02:30:31.117 --> 02:30:36.158]  And some idiot says, I work for the Pope.
[02:30:36.398 --> 02:30:38.759]  It's like saying Superman works for Lex Luthor.
[02:30:38.939 --> 02:30:40.199]  And I'm not saying Catholics are Lex Luthor.
[02:30:40.659 --> 02:30:41.519]  I respect Catholics.
[02:30:41.579 --> 02:30:42.419]  It's a diverse group of people.
[02:30:43.019 --> 02:30:44.600]  It's just, I'm not going to sit here.
[02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:46.080]  I don't work for Jews.
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:47.580]  I don't work for Catholics.
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:50.081]  I don't work for the Southern Baptist Convention.
[02:30:50.481 --> 02:30:51.381]  I am my own man.
[02:30:51.401 --> 02:30:55.542]  I get up here and look at the news and I try to give you my best analysis of what's happening.
[02:30:57.210 --> 02:31:04.514]  And for everybody thinking if you just bash Jews all day, you're like moving the meter up, you're moving the meter the wrong direction.
[02:31:06.956 --> 02:31:09.938]  Because the people controlling the Jews are as smart as they come.
[02:31:10.598 --> 02:31:12.319]  You go, oh no they're not, they're just a bunch of criminals.
[02:31:12.799 --> 02:31:14.721]  Oh well you just said they're supermen, now they're dumb.
[02:31:15.481 --> 02:31:18.503]  The people running the Jews know Hegelian dialectic.
[02:31:20.615 --> 02:31:27.558]  And you go mess with the general Jews, who are highly successful, they're gonna give all their money to their so-called protectors, who are the ones overseeing their destruction.
[02:31:29.198 --> 02:31:31.539]  So, I refuse to play the ADL's game.
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:41.003]  If I slip on a banana peel, or I don't file my taxes, or I drink too much, or I have a heart attack from eating too much, you know, whatever, I don't sit there and blame a Jew at the end of the day.
[02:31:41.323 --> 02:31:43.604]  And yeah, you can look at the heads of the big pharma.
[02:31:44.104 --> 02:31:45.265]  Bunch of them are Jews and all that.
[02:31:45.545 --> 02:31:45.945]  I get it.
[02:31:47.045 --> 02:31:50.427]  Because they're overachieving, and they recruit into themselves.
[02:31:50.728 --> 02:31:51.468]  And it's a problem.
[02:31:51.488 --> 02:31:52.569]  The Jewish Mafia is a problem.
[02:31:52.869 --> 02:31:53.550]  And I'll call them out.
[02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:58.213]  But I will not... If somebody's in the Italian Mafia, I don't blame all Italians for it.
[02:31:59.354 --> 02:32:02.576]  And that's what I'm trying to say, is you have to judge people individually.
[02:32:04.457 --> 02:32:05.538]  And that's where I'm at on the Jews.
[02:32:06.899 --> 02:32:09.041]  And I really want to break the ADL.
[02:32:10.121 --> 02:32:11.282]  And I don't want World War III.
[02:32:11.863 --> 02:32:14.805]  But, I mean, Biden gave 6 billion to the Iranians.
[02:32:16.690 --> 02:32:18.312]  And then it's Israel stood down.
[02:32:18.332 --> 02:32:24.258]  There's a bunch of weird, sneaky weirdness and Israel's totally tied to the Persians.
[02:32:24.698 --> 02:32:26.300]  Really one of the modern Jewish brain.
[02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:27.381]  It's very Persian.
[02:32:28.042 --> 02:32:30.765]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's bad.
[02:32:32.186 --> 02:32:35.670]  So I can sit back and look at a setup from a mile away.
[02:32:37.409 --> 02:32:40.370]  And I'm not getting sucked into the Jews, the Persians, any of these people.
[02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:42.531]  They want to sit over the Middle East and murder each other.
[02:32:42.571 --> 02:32:43.792]  Just knock yourselves out, man.
[02:32:44.132 --> 02:32:46.013]  I just want prosperity, freedom, and justice.
[02:32:46.793 --> 02:32:48.374]  And that's why everybody tried to come here.
[02:32:48.854 --> 02:32:50.395]  And I really care about everybody.
[02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:54.116]  But I don't care if you're a Persian, a Jew, a Catholic, a Protestant.
[02:32:54.557 --> 02:33:01.300]  If you want to cut my son's penis off, or you want a World War III, or you want open borders, you want to devalue my currency, I'm going to oppose you.
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:04.301]  And I'm not going to go, I oppose you because you're a Persian or a Jew.
[02:33:05.615 --> 02:33:06.235]  Or Catholic.
[02:33:06.816 --> 02:33:09.438]  I'm gonna say I oppose your policies.
[02:33:11.959 --> 02:33:12.700]  I have all these clips.
[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:13.681]  I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[02:33:13.741 --> 02:33:18.364]  I have like six or seven incredible clips of Democrats saying white people are weird.
[02:33:18.584 --> 02:33:20.005]  They don't know how to eat tacos.
[02:33:20.065 --> 02:33:22.366]  It's the equivalent of saying black people eat watermelon.
[02:33:22.427 --> 02:33:24.168]  It's like weird tropes.
[02:33:25.629 --> 02:33:25.749]  And
[02:33:27.219 --> 02:33:29.662]  If you criticize Kamala, you're a racist against black people.
[02:33:30.302 --> 02:33:35.768]  We need to cut through all that crap and not buy into getting into the racial issues of these people.
[02:33:38.250 --> 02:33:39.832]  And we can all have differences of opinion.
[02:33:40.653 --> 02:33:42.174]  And we've all got to stand up for ourselves.
[02:33:42.855 --> 02:33:48.181]  But powerful groups can control through balkanization and tribal stuff.
[02:33:48.201 --> 02:33:48.961]  Well, I've got a tribe.
[02:33:49.622 --> 02:33:50.343]  It's Jesus Christ.
[02:33:51.764 --> 02:33:53.005]  It's self-defense.
[02:33:53.065 --> 02:33:54.386]  It's free market capitalism.
[02:33:55.086 --> 02:34:04.092]  And I don't care what group you're in, if you salute that, and you support that, and you prove you're that, you're gonna be successful, and you're gonna be my brother.
[02:34:05.053 --> 02:34:05.993]  And so that's where I stand.
[02:34:07.594 --> 02:34:09.736]  I refuse to be sucked into this stuff.
[02:34:10.696 --> 02:34:13.738]  And that's why the ADL, behind the scenes, is financing my destruction.
[02:34:14.279 --> 02:34:16.961]  Because they need this race war, and they're as bad as you can get.
[02:34:18.802 --> 02:34:20.363]  And I expose them.
[02:34:21.869 --> 02:34:36.440]  But this litmus test of all the anti-Jew people fighting with each other to prove how much they can prove they hate Jews, you're using Jews as an excuse for your own failure to take control of your life and society.
[02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:44.966]  So see, I believe, not as an Anglo-Saxon, Germanic person, that's a little bit of Native American, but that's what I am.
[02:34:44.986 --> 02:34:47.608]  I mean, I'm about as Germanic as you can get.
[02:34:47.768 --> 02:34:49.590]  I'm the literal spitting image of it.
[02:34:53.447 --> 02:34:57.512]  I believe in who I am and what I can build through God, through me.
[02:34:59.374 --> 02:35:06.363]  But I don't think of myself as some Germanic person, though I'm proud of myself and stand up for myself and don't like people being attacked just because we're white.
[02:35:10.928 --> 02:35:11.890]  But I'm about the issues.
[02:35:13.373 --> 02:35:18.775]  And you can't debate the issue of inflation, or fentanyl, or open borders, or sex trafficking.
[02:35:19.095 --> 02:35:20.715]  Why do we let them make it racial?
[02:35:20.936 --> 02:35:25.897]  They want to make criticizing Kamala Harris with price controls and open border about she's black?
[02:35:27.278 --> 02:35:28.278]  Of course she's not black.
[02:35:28.318 --> 02:35:28.858]  It's all fake.
[02:35:28.878 --> 02:35:30.579]  But the point is, why even go there?
[02:35:32.479 --> 02:35:34.000]  Why get to that level?
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:35.080]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:37.781]  If a Jew's got a good policy, support him.
[02:35:38.321 --> 02:35:39.622]  If a Jew's got a bad policy,
[02:35:40.697 --> 02:35:41.338]  Don't support him.
[02:35:41.879 --> 02:35:42.220]  Fight him.
[02:35:42.861 --> 02:35:46.188]  Same thing with a Catholic or a Protestant or a Hindu or anybody.
[02:35:46.208 --> 02:35:49.955]  I mean, this is such a no-brainer, folks.
[02:35:49.975 --> 02:35:52.239]  Can we just deal with policy?
[02:35:54.704 --> 02:35:57.367]  My grandfather always said, I don't want to hear talk, I want to see action.
[02:35:57.827 --> 02:35:58.989]  Christ sent you a tree by its roots.
[02:35:59.469 --> 02:36:00.130]  That's policy.
[02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:02.612]  What do you produce?
[02:36:03.073 --> 02:36:04.875]  What comes out of the end of your factory?
[02:36:05.395 --> 02:36:06.316]  Success or failure?
[02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:08.158]  Does your machine work or does it fail?
[02:36:08.919 --> 02:36:10.841]  Does your music sound great or is it horrible?
[02:36:11.081 --> 02:36:13.103]  Is your food delicious and healthy or is it poisonous?
[02:36:13.704 --> 02:36:15.106]  Does your drug work or does it fail?
[02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:20.262]  I want to just look at something objectively and say, does that work or does that fail?
[02:36:20.282 --> 02:36:20.903]  Like a hunting dog.
[02:36:21.103 --> 02:36:22.564]  Does that dog go get the duck?
[02:36:22.764 --> 02:36:23.845]  Does that dog get the quail?
[02:36:24.045 --> 02:36:24.825]  Does it get the dove?
[02:36:25.045 --> 02:36:26.066]  Does it do what I tell it?
[02:36:26.086 --> 02:36:26.886]  Does it come right back?
[02:36:26.926 --> 02:36:27.687]  Does it eat the bird?
[02:36:32.833 --> 02:36:33.994]  Now you see where I'm going here.
[02:36:34.014 --> 02:36:35.574]  I didn't mean to do a 15-20 minute rant.
[02:36:35.594 --> 02:36:36.415]  I got loaded phones.
[02:36:36.435 --> 02:36:39.096]  I'm going to take some of Jay Dyer's time, because he understands that happens.
[02:36:39.376 --> 02:36:40.437]  It's no offense.
[02:36:40.477 --> 02:36:41.517]  They know part of being a fourth hour.
[02:36:41.577 --> 02:36:45.459]  I may carve out and commandeer some time.
[02:36:45.479 --> 02:36:47.800]  But I'm going to get to all your calls, but you may get only one minute apiece.
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:49.221]  But there you go, Gary.
[02:36:49.521 --> 02:36:52.642]  There's the definitive Alex Jones on the Jews, all right?
[02:36:56.364 --> 02:36:57.624]  Do I get a moment?
[02:36:57.925 --> 02:36:58.225]  You do.
[02:36:58.425 --> 02:36:58.645]  Go ahead.
[02:36:59.716 --> 02:37:00.476]  No, not at all.
[02:37:00.496 --> 02:37:00.796]  Not at all.
[02:37:00.816 --> 02:37:02.217]  And I want to say what you said was beautifully said.
[02:37:02.237 --> 02:37:04.137]  I agree with you on, you know, everything.
[02:37:30.914 --> 02:37:38.882]  A specific group of people, you know, I didn't say the Jewish people, I said AIPAC was what I said specifically because, like I said, you know, I mentioned Thomas Massey.
[02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:48.973]  He critiques, with Chuckle Carlson, a friend of yours, the AIPAC, the foreign nation that is operating within America, within our, specifically within our government.
[02:37:49.513 --> 02:37:52.997]  Three days later, however many days it was, his wife dies under
[02:37:53.624 --> 02:37:55.546]  Mysterious random circumstances.
[02:37:55.586 --> 02:37:57.908]  There's instances of that happening throughout history.
[02:37:57.928 --> 02:37:59.950]  You know, you brought up the USS Liberty.
[02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:03.072]  Um, we could talk about the six dancing Israelis.
[02:38:03.833 --> 02:38:10.679]  Um, you know, Jewish Mossad agents that were, you know, dancing and celebrating and recording what was happening at 9-11 with the Twin Towers.
[02:38:10.739 --> 02:38:12.380]  Something that I remember watching as a child.
[02:38:13.121 --> 02:38:19.606]  Um, so my point is I'm bringing up that not as because they're Jewish, but because you have just like what your whole show is based on.
[02:38:19.987 --> 02:38:20.587]  It's not that the 1%
[02:38:21.809 --> 02:38:22.189]  We're good to go.
[02:38:51.829 --> 02:38:59.375]  Their inception to manipulate the way that we look at things to, to manipulate the way that our government does things without our vote.
[02:39:00.116 --> 02:39:05.000]  And my, my, my original question to you is how do we, how do we combat that correctly?
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:07.722]  Like, you know, and you brought it up, you, you said the correct thing.
[02:39:08.443 --> 02:39:15.289]  Um, you know, you do it without falling into their dog whistles and their straw man arguments, but how does that change the fact that?
[02:39:16.229 --> 02:39:20.533]  These people that are running our nation are still being funded primarily by a foreign nation.
[02:39:21.254 --> 02:39:27.060]  I think it's wrong that AIPAC is involved domestically, and I think there's other power blocs as well, but I disagree.
[02:39:28.301 --> 02:39:33.967]  Are you saying that all corruption flows out of the Jewish mafia?
[02:39:34.588 --> 02:39:36.650]  No, no, absolutely not.
[02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:38.572]  There's also a ton of other
[02:39:39.181 --> 02:39:41.102]  You know, the groups you bring up as well.
[02:39:41.202 --> 02:39:42.844]  I'm not saying that's the answer.
[02:39:42.864 --> 02:39:44.125]  There's never one thing.
[02:39:44.165 --> 02:39:44.965]  There's always thousands.
[02:39:45.325 --> 02:39:49.569]  I'm only saying you understand that AIPAC is more powerful when people attack Jews.
[02:39:50.069 --> 02:39:51.810]  You understand they have nuclear weapons?
[02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:52.791]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:39:52.811 --> 02:39:53.932]  You know, it's part of that.
[02:39:53.992 --> 02:39:54.992]  You bring something up.
[02:39:55.012 --> 02:40:08.062]  But at the same time, I'm saying, like when I originally had talked, I said, at the community level, with our senators who are being funded by, let's just say, not just AIPAC, but another group that is
[02:40:09.445 --> 02:40:15.467]  Yeah, Communist China, British intelligence, all of it.
[02:40:15.507 --> 02:40:16.507]  I appreciate your call.
[02:40:16.547 --> 02:40:17.088]  I gotta go.
[02:40:17.528 --> 02:40:21.989]  I said 30 minutes on this, and it's good points, and it needs to be talked about.
[02:40:22.049 --> 02:40:26.251]  It's just like, how about we're just against the poison shots?
[02:40:26.311 --> 02:40:27.671]  How about we're just against 5G?
[02:40:27.731 --> 02:40:29.832]  How about we're just against the central bank digital currency?
[02:40:30.812 --> 02:40:35.614]  And that's all I'm saying is, I don't even like get up in the morning and say, well, I gotta go fight the Jews today.
[02:40:36.707 --> 02:40:38.568]  I mean, of course Jews are powerful, successful.
[02:40:38.608 --> 02:40:41.831]  They're all over the globalist operation because those are people that want to be successful.
[02:40:42.331 --> 02:40:44.472]  How about we build a system that's successful outside of that?
[02:40:44.492 --> 02:40:45.253]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[02:40:46.634 --> 02:40:48.355]  Billy in Connecticut, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:40:48.375 --> 02:40:48.675]  Go ahead.
[02:40:50.196 --> 02:40:51.297]  A couple points.
[02:40:52.098 --> 02:40:54.219]  One I have is what I, my opinion.
[02:40:54.239 --> 02:40:58.522]  So I think that the globalists are still going forward with plans.
[02:40:58.542 --> 02:40:59.643]  They have multi-plans.
[02:41:00.303 --> 02:41:03.085]  And the good thing, my opinion, you're waking people up.
[02:41:03.185 --> 02:41:04.226]  And the more people that are awake,
[02:41:04.787 --> 02:41:08.128]  I think it's going to come down to the election, if they do have it.
[02:41:08.669 --> 02:41:12.610]  Whatever, they said that even if Trump wins, they're not going to, you know, certify him.
[02:41:13.031 --> 02:41:19.553]  But that's when I think, when they go to take it away from us, is we're going to see, you're going to wake a lot of people.
[02:41:19.573 --> 02:41:20.014]  No, no, I agree.
[02:41:20.034 --> 02:41:23.415]  Everybody keeps obsessing on the election in 80 days.
[02:41:23.515 --> 02:41:27.037]  No, the real stuff starts in the 79 days after that.
[02:41:28.237 --> 02:41:30.258]  And that's, they're going to tell the people you have woken up.
[02:41:30.859 --> 02:41:34.903]  How many percentage people are not going to do anything still because they're not built like that.
[02:41:35.243 --> 02:41:41.609]  But I think the more you wake up, the more percentage of people are going to understand what's going on and take a stand and fight back.
[02:41:41.889 --> 02:41:47.354]  And I don't just mean like, you know, physical fight, but they're the more awakened people that will do something about it.
[02:41:47.574 --> 02:41:50.958]  We have a better shot at taking this, taking this over.
[02:41:50.978 --> 02:41:55.261]  That's why I love that every day you hit the same points home all the time.
[02:41:56.811 --> 02:41:58.732]  The more you do it, the more people awake.
[02:41:58.772 --> 02:42:00.092]  Here's one or two a day.
[02:42:00.652 --> 02:42:07.494]  It's going to come down to they are definitely going to not let Trump win or whatever they want, they're going to go for broke.
[02:42:07.714 --> 02:42:08.494]  I mean, that's right.
[02:42:08.554 --> 02:42:12.695]  It's like Naomi Wolf said, who's Jewish, by the way, there's a global coup against America.
[02:42:12.935 --> 02:42:13.995]  We've got to come together.
[02:42:14.035 --> 02:42:14.796]  We've got to defeat them.
[02:42:15.516 --> 02:42:16.796]  Pure crises is coming.
[02:42:16.836 --> 02:42:18.456]  And I don't even know the answers to all of it.
[02:42:18.476 --> 02:42:20.477]  We need to admit, though, it's coming.
[02:42:22.034 --> 02:42:25.076]  Right, and like I say, when it does, we have to understand it.
[02:42:25.096 --> 02:42:28.359]  Like, now you kid home to me so much, I understand.
[02:42:28.399 --> 02:42:30.280]  It's not gonna be like, well, maybe it's just happening.
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:30.721]  I don't know.
[02:42:30.961 --> 02:42:31.761]  It's not like that anymore.
[02:42:31.781 --> 02:42:32.702]  It used to be like that for me.
[02:42:33.062 --> 02:42:38.066]  Now it's like, when something goes wrong and something weird's happening, we know it's happening now.
[02:42:38.126 --> 02:42:41.889]  And I hope other people think the same way I do, and we'll take a stand.
[02:42:42.369 --> 02:42:48.574]  And that the more of us take a stand, the bigger we'll make a scene, the bigger we'll wake other people up seeing what's going on.
[02:42:49.075 --> 02:42:49.595]  That's my hope.
[02:42:50.919 --> 02:42:53.382]  The second thing I have... Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:42:53.442 --> 02:42:55.584]  Go ahead.
[02:42:55.724 --> 02:43:07.076]  I was in the courtroom June 14th with you, and I don't understand how the other side said, oh, he's telling people not to buy, just buy from his father's place.
[02:43:07.356 --> 02:43:08.817]  You've never said that once in here.
[02:43:09.138 --> 02:43:11.020]  They said it twice to the judge.
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:12.201]  I don't understand why...
[02:43:12.802 --> 02:43:14.544]  You watched the judge fire all those people, then?
[02:43:14.564 --> 02:43:16.305]  No, they got caught in a coup, lying.
[02:43:39.705 --> 02:43:41.986]  And now we're still open, and by the grace of God, we're still here.
[02:43:42.006 --> 02:43:43.727]  And I appreciate you coming into this.
[02:43:43.747 --> 02:43:44.207]  It just bothers me.
[02:43:45.188 --> 02:43:47.509]  I almost yelled out, that's bullshit!
[02:43:47.609 --> 02:43:48.749]  I really did, excuse my mind.
[02:43:48.769 --> 02:43:49.410]  I really did!
[02:43:49.430 --> 02:43:52.491]  Like, that's so mad, it's like, it's like I listened 100% of the time.
[02:43:52.631 --> 02:43:56.513]  Brother, they said I had $400 million and that I made it off them.
[02:43:56.973 --> 02:43:59.934]  A, I've never had more than, you know, $5 million in the bank.
[02:44:00.415 --> 02:44:02.456]  And B, I made no money off those people.
[02:44:02.516 --> 02:44:03.116]  It's all made up.
[02:44:04.659 --> 02:44:06.379]  Yeah, I don't know how you do it.
[02:44:06.399 --> 02:44:07.140]  God bless you, man.
[02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:07.840]  I love you, man.
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:08.980]  I keep up the good work.
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:10.680]  You know how I do it?
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:12.701]  Knowing we've got supporters like you, Billy.
[02:44:13.281 --> 02:44:14.741]  I mean, this is a pleasure to do.
[02:44:15.481 --> 02:44:18.762]  The only frustration is I don't want to sit here and plug all day and grovel and beg.
[02:44:18.802 --> 02:44:20.122]  I just wanted to cover the news.
[02:44:20.302 --> 02:44:22.243]  So we try to bring you great products you're going to like.
[02:44:22.263 --> 02:44:23.063]  We fund the operation.
[02:44:23.083 --> 02:44:27.404]  But no, this is a pleasure to serve you and to serve my family and myself.
[02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:31.485]  I mean, let me tell you, rolling over and begging in the New World Order, that's a fate worse than death.
[02:44:31.505 --> 02:44:33.445]  So please, thanks for the call.
[02:44:34.591 --> 02:44:36.872]  I don't want people ever to think what I do is heroic.
[02:44:38.032 --> 02:44:38.992]  I know what's going on.
[02:44:39.252 --> 02:44:40.972]  I'm not rolling over these people and dying.
[02:44:41.973 --> 02:44:44.273]  So I oppose all their policies and all their crap.
[02:44:44.633 --> 02:44:45.833]  I don't care what group they're in.
[02:44:45.854 --> 02:44:46.454]  I oppose them.
[02:44:47.434 --> 02:44:54.035]  Chinese, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, you know, real simple.
[02:44:54.055 --> 02:44:56.396]  Hey, I don't agree with what you want to do.
[02:44:57.381 --> 02:45:00.743]  I'm not going to have your little fake debate about what color you are, like all these videos.
[02:45:00.783 --> 02:45:01.763]  Oh, Trump's a racist.
[02:45:01.783 --> 02:45:02.644]  He hates black people.
[02:45:03.004 --> 02:45:04.244]  It's a diversion, people.
[02:45:04.304 --> 02:45:05.305]  It's not true.
[02:45:06.005 --> 02:45:08.026]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[02:45:08.106 --> 02:45:08.566]  Stay with us.
[02:45:08.746 --> 02:45:09.507]  Our number four, actually.
[02:45:10.598 --> 02:45:14.582]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:45:14.602 --> 02:45:17.404]  And you've seen a lot of the things that InfoWars has gone through.
[02:45:18.025 --> 02:45:24.070]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:45:24.590 --> 02:45:29.234]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:45:29.935 --> 02:45:41.482]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:45:42.082 --> 02:45:50.867]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:45:51.307 --> 02:45:54.029]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products
[02:45:54.669 --> 02:46:00.437]  Are actually our famous products simply private labeled and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:46:00.757 --> 02:46:01.779]  They're all top of the line.
[02:46:01.799 --> 02:46:02.840]  They're already best sellers.
[02:46:03.141 --> 02:46:08.608]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names, but they are all the very best.
[02:46:09.068 --> 02:46:11.171]  So this line is called Info Wars MD.
[02:46:12.192 --> 02:46:13.913]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:46:14.274 --> 02:46:17.916]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:46:18.336 --> 02:46:20.577]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:46:21.398 --> 02:46:24.280]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:26.521]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:46:26.541 --> 02:46:28.282]  It's so good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
[02:46:28.643 --> 02:46:30.744]  It is the exact same formula.
[02:46:31.044 --> 02:46:32.566]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[02:46:32.846 --> 02:46:34.067]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[02:46:34.347 --> 02:46:37.771]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[02:46:37.811 --> 02:46:42.796]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mikovits and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:46:43.256 --> 02:46:45.579]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[02:46:45.599 --> 02:46:51.685]  You want to check out the line of InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:46:52.285 --> 02:46:54.247]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:46:54.347 --> 02:46:55.549]  I need you to take action.
[02:46:55.849 --> 02:46:56.990]  You will love these products.
[02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:58.572]  They work really, really good.
[02:46:58.812 --> 02:47:08.822]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[02:47:09.022 --> 02:47:09.803]  Thank you for your support.
[02:47:09.943 --> 02:47:13.084]  We got a big announcement at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:47:22.126 --> 02:47:28.147]  Discover the newest line of supplements from InfoWars designed to boost vitality and enhance overall well-being.
[02:47:28.487 --> 02:47:33.568]  Whether you're looking to support immune health, improve cognitive function, or increase energy levels,
[02:47:39.093 --> 02:47:42.436]  We've got something for everyone at the Infowars MD line.
[02:47:43.237 --> 02:47:45.139]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:47:45.299 --> 02:47:47.401]  Just look into all the benefits of collagen, folks.
[02:47:47.421 --> 02:47:50.844]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.
[02:47:50.984 --> 02:47:52.566]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:47:53.286 --> 02:47:54.567]  Superfood greens.
[02:47:54.627 --> 02:47:55.468]  Are you getting the fiber?
[02:47:55.528 --> 02:47:56.929]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:47:57.449 --> 02:48:00.071]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:48:00.171 --> 02:48:01.172]  Superfood greens.
[02:48:01.612 --> 02:48:02.553]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:48:02.673 --> 02:48:05.095]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:48:05.115 --> 02:48:06.116]  You might not like eating them.
[02:48:06.156 --> 02:48:09.278]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:48:09.298 --> 02:48:11.340]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:12.820]  And get all the benefits.
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:17.682]  Mushroom Maxx, Better Mood Plus, Libido RX, Turmeric 95.
[02:48:17.882 --> 02:48:20.062]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:48:20.442 --> 02:48:24.764]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:48:24.804 --> 02:48:28.205]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[02:48:28.505 --> 02:48:35.467]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:48:36.948 --> 02:48:37.949]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:38.309 --> 02:48:39.130]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:40.031]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:48:40.051 --> 02:48:41.973]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:48:42.293 --> 02:48:44.335]  But that's why turmeric is so important.
[02:48:44.375 --> 02:48:45.636]  Turmeric 95, 25% off.
[02:48:45.856 --> 02:48:47.818]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:48:47.918 --> 02:48:49.099]  The prostate support.
[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:50.641]  Very important for men.
[02:48:51.161 --> 02:48:51.942]  Nerve Renew.
[02:48:52.182 --> 02:48:53.143]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:48:53.884 --> 02:48:54.905]  Both of those things are key.
[02:48:54.945 --> 02:48:56.046]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:48:56.246 --> 02:48:58.989]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:48:59.249 --> 02:48:59.910]  Good night's sleep.
[02:49:00.411 --> 02:49:06.177]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:06.277 --> 02:49:07.579]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:49:08.079 --> 02:49:09.701]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:49:09.721 --> 02:49:12.865]  Alright, I'm gonna say one more thing about Jews, and then finish up some calls.
[02:49:14.206 --> 02:49:15.267]  Take Dr. Zelenko.
[02:49:16.414 --> 02:49:19.558]  Orthodox Jew, you know, Hasidic Jew.
[02:49:20.199 --> 02:49:20.720]  Great guy.
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:22.862]  Day one comes out and exposes the poison shots.
[02:49:23.463 --> 02:49:26.947]  Comes out with all of these, you know, great therapeutics that save millions of people.
[02:49:27.708 --> 02:49:29.450]  And he's criticizing the whole New World Order.
[02:49:29.470 --> 02:49:30.151]  He was a beautiful guy.
[02:49:30.171 --> 02:49:31.213]  Let's put an image of him on screen.
[02:49:32.099 --> 02:49:45.427]  And then he was dying of cancer during this, didn't tell anybody, came on two days before he died, said, I'll probably die, my heart's failing, but I love all of you, and I love Christians, and I love Jesus, and I love everybody, and we all need to just come together and love each other, goodbye.
[02:49:45.887 --> 02:49:47.768]  And he didn't, he wasn't lying, he was dead two days later.
[02:49:49.509 --> 02:49:51.951]  So he's a good man, he's a good soul, he's a good person.
[02:49:52.951 --> 02:49:57.314]  So I refuse to sit there and besmirch people like him because he's Jewish.
[02:49:57.354 --> 02:49:58.214]  Are there some evil Jews?
[02:49:58.234 --> 02:49:59.515]  You better damn well believe there are.
[02:50:01.089 --> 02:50:04.150]  Because, you know, there's bad people everywhere.
[02:50:04.611 --> 02:50:05.731]  And Jews are overachievers.
[02:50:05.751 --> 02:50:08.593]  So you're going to have overachievers that are good, overachievers that are bad.
[02:50:08.613 --> 02:50:10.153]  My job is not to be an apologist for Jews.
[02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:14.115]  But I refuse to just sit there and attack a people.
[02:50:14.695 --> 02:50:16.816]  Now, you can take Islam.
[02:50:17.217 --> 02:50:20.378]  Jews, it's more racial, but it's also religious with Islam.
[02:50:20.918 --> 02:50:23.740]  You have a lot of nice Muslims, but Islam wants to take over.
[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:25.320]  It wants to force you to convert.
[02:50:25.581 --> 02:50:26.761]  It's hard to convert to Judaism.
[02:50:27.522 --> 02:50:29.062]  And I'm not a Muslim bashing thing.
[02:50:29.082 --> 02:50:30.103]  I don't want to kill them either.
[02:50:31.018 --> 02:50:33.240]  But I mean, you know, they're taking over, folks.
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:36.542]  And then there's that whole fake fight that's going on.
[02:50:36.582 --> 02:50:39.864]  So I'm saying there's something more sophisticated happening here.
[02:50:41.145 --> 02:50:42.326]  And so I just go with policy.
[02:50:44.127 --> 02:50:50.072]  What I support, and it doesn't matter whether you're a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian, then are you on our team.
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:55.543]  Of a free market, free society, security, freedom of speech.
[02:50:56.083 --> 02:50:59.186]  If you support that, I don't need to look whether you're a Jew or whether you're a Muslim.
[02:50:59.786 --> 02:51:01.968]  If you support that, then I support you.
[02:51:02.668 --> 02:51:04.249]  If you don't, then I'm your enemy.
[02:51:06.011 --> 02:51:08.613]  So I'm the enemy of the ADL, but I love Dr. Zelenko.
[02:51:09.213 --> 02:51:10.334]  He was a beautiful person.
[02:51:12.816 --> 02:51:15.278]  And so, you know, that's where I stand.
[02:51:15.798 --> 02:51:17.339]  Alright, James in Ohio.
[02:51:17.379 --> 02:51:18.140]  James, thanks for holding.
[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:18.420]  Go ahead.
[02:51:20.455 --> 02:51:29.119]  Fellow InfoWars listeners, this is my case to why and how we need to keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:37.464]  Number one, repent of your sins, turn your life over to Jesus, get down on your knees and pray for God for direction.
[02:51:38.624 --> 02:51:47.729]  Could you imagine navigating the COVID scam without InfoWars being on the air?
[02:51:49.270 --> 02:51:50.110]  Could you imagine?
[02:51:51.237 --> 02:51:58.300]  I'm thinking there wasn't inflation by listening to the mainstream media without InfoWars on the air.
[02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:09.584]  If you go to InfoWarsStore.com, there are a treasure trove of products that you already use at home.
[02:52:10.404 --> 02:52:10.964]  And I get it.
[02:52:10.984 --> 02:52:12.445]  I'm the same way.
[02:52:12.465 --> 02:52:18.007]  You know, you listen to the broadcast, you take it for granted, you think it's going to be there every day.
[02:52:18.669 --> 02:52:19.270]  We're good to go.
[02:52:34.031 --> 02:52:36.893]  And pharmaceutical companies to stay on the air.
[02:52:37.253 --> 02:52:50.481]  This is a listener supported show, which means if we as the listeners that don't have to pay a monthly fee to listen to this, don't support him and his crew and buy their products, he will not be on air.
[02:52:50.901 --> 02:52:59.366]  And then the next time something like COVID comes or something dramatic comes and hits us, we're not going to know the true side of the story.
[02:52:59.726 --> 02:53:03.048]  So it is up to us, just like in the Revolutionary Wars,
[02:53:03.812 --> 02:53:09.917]  To support our army, and right now the army is the army of information.
[02:53:11.038 --> 02:53:20.866]  I was just on the site today, going through it, and I realized, wow, I spent $100 for one night's dinner for my wife and I. I've got storable food.
[02:53:21.286 --> 02:53:21.987]  Three months for $700.
[02:53:22.427 --> 02:53:26.410]  How is storable food not a good idea right now?
[02:53:26.771 --> 02:53:30.434]  We just watched the price of groceries double in the past year and a half.
[02:53:31.075 --> 02:53:32.376]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[02:53:32.396 --> 02:53:39.860]  I want you to continue and finish up because, yeah, if people lost herbal food the last more than 10 years from us three years ago, it's already doubled in price of inflation.
[02:53:40.220 --> 02:53:41.241]  Think how much money you would have saved.
[02:53:41.781 --> 02:53:42.421]  It's a great point.
[02:53:42.801 --> 02:53:47.504]  We try to just sell things that are great value so you love it and so you support us and have a great deal.
[02:53:47.524 --> 02:53:48.705]  But I want you to finish your point, James.
[02:53:48.985 --> 02:53:50.145]  We'll go to Robin in Florida.
[02:53:50.165 --> 02:53:50.506]  Stay with us.
[02:53:50.846 --> 02:53:53.607]  And Jay Dyer is coming up in a few minutes, but I wanted to finish up with your calls.
[02:53:54.007 --> 02:53:56.269]  James in Ohio, finish your point about prepping for the worst.
[02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.609]  Go ahead.
[02:53:59.242 --> 02:54:00.243]  Go ahead, James.
[02:54:00.403 --> 02:54:12.810]  I could go on all day about how supporting this broadcast is a good idea and how it's a necessity in these times, but I'm going to put out a challenge to all the other listeners out there, and my wife and I did it.
[02:54:14.051 --> 02:54:15.492]  Cancel your Netflix account.
[02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:17.473]  Cancel your Prime Video.
[02:54:17.553 --> 02:54:18.534]  Cancel your Hulu.
[02:54:18.914 --> 02:54:20.515]  Stop putting that crap in your mind.
[02:54:21.976 --> 02:54:26.158]  Go to the donate button on Alex's site and donate $10
[02:54:27.774 --> 02:54:29.996]  Reoccur at 30, 60, or 90 days.
[02:54:30.136 --> 02:54:48.568]  It's not a lot of money, but I promise you, if Alex goes down, and this broadcast isn't here, at least you know you did your part to make sure you did everything you could to make sure that the world got the information that they needed to get.
[02:54:48.628 --> 02:54:50.189]  Well, brother, thank you, James, for the call.
[02:54:50.209 --> 02:54:51.930]  Let me just say this, and I'll do a few more calls in the end.
[02:54:51.950 --> 02:54:55.092]  The Batata Jedi are always listening to while I have lunch after he comes on.
[02:54:57.256 --> 02:55:04.560]  Remember they said in the fake court cases where I was already found guilty that I had $300 to $400 million that I made it off these people and I peed on kids' graves.
[02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:05.140]  None of it was true.
[02:55:06.101 --> 02:55:06.721]  Not 1% of it.
[02:55:09.143 --> 02:55:18.108]  And now the New York Times, Washington Post, in the last few months, you look it up, said it turns out Alex Jones didn't have any money.
[02:55:20.409 --> 02:55:22.430]  He had a couple billion dollars of assets.
[02:55:23.411 --> 02:55:25.212]  I told you, I don't care about that.
[02:55:26.818 --> 02:55:27.278]  I'm not.
[02:55:27.378 --> 02:55:29.859]  If I wanted money, I could have sold out of the Globos a long time ago.
[02:55:30.399 --> 02:55:33.040]  But that was a lie to make you think, don't support.
[02:55:33.541 --> 02:55:37.362]  Like the Democrat lawyers said, if they won those fake cases, don't donate, don't give money.
[02:55:37.402 --> 02:55:38.443]  They don't want money.
[02:55:38.923 --> 02:55:39.983]  They want to shut down.
[02:55:40.463 --> 02:55:46.646]  But they lied to you and told you that I am like David Rockefeller or something and have all this crap.
[02:55:46.766 --> 02:55:47.126]  I don't.
[02:55:48.581 --> 02:55:49.741]  And so again, that's why.
[02:55:50.242 --> 02:55:52.202]  Plus, you want the products you support, so thank you.
[02:55:52.623 --> 02:55:53.403]  But enough about that.
[02:55:54.343 --> 02:55:58.925]  Look, we got loaded phone lines here, and I feel sorry for everybody because I want to get to Jay Dyer.
[02:55:58.965 --> 02:55:59.665]  But let's move quick.
[02:56:00.306 --> 02:56:01.766]  I already gave a call 30 minutes earlier.
[02:56:01.786 --> 02:56:02.426]  That's my fault.
[02:56:02.847 --> 02:56:04.087]  Robin in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:56:04.127 --> 02:56:05.768]  Thanks for calling Election Predictions.
[02:56:05.808 --> 02:56:06.028]  Go ahead.
[02:56:07.213 --> 02:56:08.334]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:56:08.694 --> 02:56:10.015]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:56:10.456 --> 02:56:14.879]  First, before I say my election prediction, I want to say what can we do?
[02:56:15.299 --> 02:56:16.961]  What can us people do?
[02:56:17.601 --> 02:56:20.663]  First, we need to accept Jesus into our lives.
[02:56:21.704 --> 02:56:25.047]  We need to repent for our sins and continue to pray.
[02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:34.363]  You know, we all have to remember that Jesus is up there in the Kingdom of Heaven at the right hand of our God, and He is extremely patient.
[02:56:34.683 --> 02:56:38.685]  He is prolonging what is happening on this earth.
[02:56:39.105 --> 02:56:44.166]  He wants more and more people to accept Him into our lives, His lives.
[02:56:44.587 --> 02:56:45.207]  Follow Him.
[02:56:45.267 --> 02:56:46.367]  Become a follower.
[02:56:46.727 --> 02:56:48.728]  The more we can follow Jesus Christ,
[02:56:49.252 --> 02:56:52.753]  The longer he is going to prolong his second coming.
[02:56:53.033 --> 02:56:57.734]  I do believe we're close or either in the end time and Jesus is coming back.
[02:56:58.114 --> 02:57:08.856]  But he is extremely patient and he is waiting for more and more of us to just turn to him and become a follower, repent for our sins.
[02:57:09.676 --> 02:57:14.357]  And as far as my election prediction goes, I don't think that there's going to be an election.
[02:57:14.917 --> 02:57:18.818]  I think that they are going to hightail a war
[02:57:19.652 --> 02:57:37.779]  By either starting some sort of cyber attack that will blow out our electrical grids or, for example, some sort of, I hope not, nuclear, you know, where it's going to wipe out a lot and they're going to hightail it into what they want, war with Iran.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:45.102]  And, you know, I think that that's why there's not going to be an election, unfortunately.
[02:57:46.149 --> 02:57:54.315]  Because I think that they're working very hard for that, and I do believe leading up as we get closer and closer, we already have seen more and more things happening.
[02:57:54.415 --> 02:58:04.041]  So, unfortunately, I pray every single day to our Lord and Savior that He will save us, and ultimately we need to have God.
[02:58:04.221 --> 02:58:08.744]  And one thing, last thing, Alex, I know you said that you don't work for anyone but yourself.
[02:58:09.144 --> 02:58:10.725]  I truly believe that you work for God.
[02:58:11.708 --> 02:58:17.754]  God bless you, and I don't know what we would do without being able to listen to InfoWars and your cast.
[02:58:17.794 --> 02:58:20.536]  You guys do a great job, and we love you so much.
[02:58:20.596 --> 02:58:22.217]  Well, Robin, thank you so much.
[02:58:22.357 --> 02:58:23.298]  I want to be clear.
[02:58:23.318 --> 02:58:26.121]  When I said I don't work for anybody, I'm trying to work for God.
[02:58:26.161 --> 02:58:27.342]  I'm trying to get in alignment with God.
[02:58:27.842 --> 02:58:30.384]  But when I said I don't work for anybody, I don't get orders.
[02:58:30.444 --> 02:58:31.225]  The crew's here all day.
[02:58:31.265 --> 02:58:31.746]  They see me.
[02:58:32.126 --> 02:58:34.007]  We're just covering news, giving our take on it.
[02:58:34.568 --> 02:58:36.970]  Because the idea that everything's controlled is a lie, folks.
[02:58:37.250 --> 02:58:38.872]  There's a lot of good in the universe as well.
[02:58:40.103 --> 02:58:41.364]  And so I'm real, you're real.
[02:58:41.824 --> 02:58:43.445]  Listeners out there, you know you're real.
[02:58:44.305 --> 02:58:46.106]  And you're the light in the darkness.
[02:58:46.126 --> 02:58:50.308]  People are now more ready to hear the truth and be awakened than ever.
[02:58:51.669 --> 02:58:56.251]  So, I'm sorry to the other callers, Cheesehead, Rich, Michael, Joe, and others.
[02:58:56.871 --> 02:59:00.213]  I'm gonna be back Sunday, Lord will it, with the Sunday Show.
[02:59:01.714 --> 02:59:04.355]  So if you give us your name and number, I'm gonna take calls this Sunday.
[02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:06.741]  I will call you back first.
[02:59:07.301 --> 02:59:07.862]  I'm out of time.
[02:59:07.902 --> 02:59:08.282]  I'm sorry.
[02:59:08.302 --> 02:59:08.843]  I apologize.
[02:59:09.443 --> 02:59:16.269]  But before Jay Dyer takes over, always loaded for Bear to cover, actual globalist documents, bestselling author of Jay's analysis.
[02:59:16.829 --> 02:59:19.031]  Jay, you heard the last caller.
[02:59:19.071 --> 02:59:20.072]  I watched you there waiting.
[02:59:23.294 --> 02:59:23.795]  I don't know.
[02:59:41.306 --> 02:59:42.767]  I'm not over-hyping things.
[02:59:42.907 --> 02:59:54.431]  I feel guilty that I'm under-hyping things because I don't have words to describe the global crisis that they're putting us into to get us to accept the new order in their own words.
[02:59:54.571 --> 02:59:55.612]  So take over now.
[02:59:55.632 --> 02:59:56.612]  I'm not going to come back.
[02:59:56.632 --> 03:00:01.654]  I just want to answer my question, please, respectfully, and then get into your main topics that you're ready for.
[03:00:01.694 --> 03:00:04.115]  But what do you really think is going to happen?
[03:00:04.135 --> 03:00:05.876]  You're not making a prediction, but dead reckoning.
[03:00:06.396 --> 03:00:07.977]  Yeah, we're not in normal times anymore.
[03:00:09.949 --> 03:00:10.509]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:10.529 --> 03:00:10.990]  Glad to be here.
[03:00:11.010 --> 03:00:18.173]  Yeah, it seems like they have a handful of cards that they can play at any moment, and maybe they're hyping up.
[03:00:18.233 --> 03:00:22.615]  It seems like every few days, one of those cards is talked about and hyped up in the media.
[03:00:22.675 --> 03:00:24.056]  So is it monkey pox?
[03:00:24.156 --> 03:00:26.997]  And then a couple days later, we'll hear about economic woes.
[03:00:27.017 --> 03:00:28.458]  There's going to be an economic collapse.
[03:00:28.478 --> 03:00:35.221]  Then a few days later, we'll hear about, you know, the possibility of war and the war in Ukraine getting ramped up, war in the Middle East.
[03:00:36.853 --> 03:00:46.456]  It just keeps compounding, and I think any one of these could be rolled out to forestall, to delay, to destroy the possibility of an election.
[03:00:46.916 --> 03:00:52.037]  Seems like they're really pushing the open borders and internal strife within countries as well.
[03:00:52.537 --> 03:01:00.559]  We've seen that with especially the UK, with Islam in the last couple of weeks, rioting and so forth, attacking native citizens.
[03:01:01.488 --> 03:01:11.650]  I want to talk about that in part because, as you guys know, the last fourth hour that I did a couple weeks ago, we covered the whole geopolitical element of Islam and how it's being used.
[03:01:12.370 --> 03:01:22.653]  And as I traveled across the country a few weeks ago, I went to Las Vegas to do an event and I noticed mosques that have popped up in places that I never would have expected.
[03:01:23.213 --> 03:01:28.174]  In fact, we drove through Indian reservations and there's now mosques that have been built on Indian reservations.
[03:01:28.234 --> 03:01:28.654]  I don't think
[03:01:29.272 --> 03:01:32.795]  Yeah, because they don't even need to bring them in if they can convert them.
[03:01:55.737 --> 03:01:57.058]  Well, there's a push, right?
[03:01:57.078 --> 03:02:09.706]  There's a push online to try to utilize certain figures and people in the media to convert the West to Islam, at the same time as there's a geopolitical push to move Islam into Europe and into the UK.
[03:02:10.046 --> 03:02:12.968]  So as you said, Islam is the mercenary force of the globalists.
[03:02:14.522 --> 03:02:22.489]  It's like the front army that they're using in particularly Europe and the UK, and they've even admitted it, right?
[03:02:22.529 --> 03:02:24.631]  So I've gone through multiple writings of the elite.
[03:02:24.751 --> 03:02:24.931]  H.G.
[03:02:24.951 --> 03:02:25.932]  Wells said they would use it.
[03:02:26.252 --> 03:02:28.674]  Bertrand Russell said Islam is great, let's use it to change Europe.
[03:02:29.195 --> 03:02:36.341]  And they said specifically, it's really the only tool that they have in the arsenal demographics-wise to change
[03:02:39.099 --> 03:02:47.306]  The whole of Europe and whether it's clergy, his own books say to change the demographics of Europe to make it a socialist federation.
[03:02:47.326 --> 03:02:49.508]  They're going to do the same thing in North America.
[03:02:49.568 --> 03:02:56.453]  Now, right now, it's a lot of Latin South American illegal immigrants, but they're also going to be pushing Islam in the US as well.
[03:02:56.533 --> 03:03:00.957]  And so that's why I wanted to bring on an expert on Islam, a friend of mine, Sam Shamoon.
[03:03:01.017 --> 03:03:02.258]  In fact, we just did a huge debate
[03:03:03.161 --> 03:03:05.082]  I ended up being a lot bigger than I expected.
[03:03:05.102 --> 03:03:08.525]  We were on Fresh and Fit, and we debated two of the top Muslims.
[03:03:09.085 --> 03:03:13.328]  It's already had, if you total up the clips and everything, multiple millions of views in the last couple days.
[03:03:13.928 --> 03:03:18.391]  And so my guest is Sam Shamoon, and I've known Sam for several years now.
[03:03:18.451 --> 03:03:19.732]  He is an expert in Islam.
[03:03:20.252 --> 03:03:21.933]  He's all over YouTube, all over TikTok.
[03:03:21.953 --> 03:03:25.416]  He's kind of blown up in the last year with a lot of these debates.
[03:03:25.516 --> 03:03:30.499]  And so I wanted to bring on an Islamic expert in terms of the history and the religious views.
[03:03:31.207 --> 03:03:32.547]  Not just the geopolitical stuff.
[03:03:32.567 --> 03:03:39.690]  If you want to know the geopolitical stuff, I covered that in the last fourth hour of Alex Jones that I hosted, where we talked about the Fabian Socialists.
[03:03:39.730 --> 03:03:53.334]  Again, I've written in many of their texts, even General Wesley Clark said that Europe would have to be destroyed in terms of its nation states and integrated into a giant melting pot to create the EU, right?
[03:03:55.177 --> 03:03:55.357]  Yeah.
[03:04:07.023 --> 03:04:11.867]  Like, pump in millions of Muslims into the US, although there are millions of Muslims in the US.
[03:04:11.887 --> 03:04:13.528]  I think there's something like six or seven already.
[03:04:14.148 --> 03:04:18.291]  But what they've done in Europe is a specific strategy, a specific technique.
[03:04:18.311 --> 03:04:21.774]  In fact, I mentioned that I'd gone to Italy a few months ago.
[03:04:21.974 --> 03:04:23.375]  I'd never been, it was my first trip.
[03:04:23.756 --> 03:04:29.380]  And there were several towns, several cities that you go to, there's no Italians, quite literally.
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:30.921]  Genoa had no Italians.
[03:04:31.693 --> 03:04:33.433]  At least we were out walking through the whole city.
[03:04:33.453 --> 03:04:34.474]  I never saw any.
[03:04:34.534 --> 03:04:35.414]  I saw a lot of Muslims.
[03:04:35.974 --> 03:04:37.974]  But I didn't see any native Italians.
[03:04:38.014 --> 03:04:40.015]  Maybe a couple running the shops or something.
[03:04:40.475 --> 03:04:41.355]  But not out on the streets.
[03:04:41.395 --> 03:04:42.315]  A couple other cities.
[03:04:42.575 --> 03:04:46.776]  It was all immigrants from Africa.
[03:04:47.056 --> 03:04:48.156]  Illegal immigrants from Africa.
[03:04:49.157 --> 03:04:52.517]  And many of whom, most of whom were Muslims and sort of just do whatever they want.
[03:04:53.238 --> 03:04:54.638]  So I don't know if we have Sam yet.
[03:04:54.658 --> 03:04:55.158]  Is Sam on?
[03:04:58.679 --> 03:04:59.299]  Sam, how you doing?
[03:04:59.359 --> 03:05:02.420]  Welcome to the fourth hour here with me.
[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:12.443]  I want to ask you, first of all, before we get into the history and the theology of the religion of Islam, people should go watch our debate that we did because it ended up being a lot bigger than I expected.
[03:05:12.843 --> 03:05:16.844]  How did you feel about that debate going into it and then coming out of it?
[03:05:18.144 --> 03:05:20.805]  Yeah, well, glorify our God and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[03:05:20.885 --> 03:05:22.146]  I praise God for that opportunity.
[03:05:22.886 --> 03:05:23.506]  To be honest, I
[03:05:24.369 --> 03:05:28.572]  Didn't like the format, the way they set up the time, but be that as it may, I didn't want to complain.
[03:05:29.253 --> 03:05:33.576]  So they didn't think that we're trying to make excuses to Ron because it backfired against them.
[03:05:33.656 --> 03:05:35.897]  I thought, in my opinion, they got decimated.
[03:05:37.018 --> 03:05:44.103]  Of course, I'm biased, but it was a landslide decimation because we focus primarily on their own sources.
[03:05:44.464 --> 03:05:46.165]  And if someone watches the debate,
[03:05:46.764 --> 03:05:54.133]  They will see they didn't really answer any of our objections, and we tried to our best ability to answer their objections with the stipulated time.
[03:05:54.173 --> 03:06:02.022]  So overall, I was pleased, though the way it was structured, it was structured in their favor, and they still lost by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[03:06:03.464 --> 03:06:12.087]  Yeah, I think for our audience here, most people in the West and, you know, in the last five or six years, I've really been trying to study and learn about Islam.
[03:06:12.107 --> 03:06:14.668]  I'm still far from being an expert, you know, way more than I do.
[03:06:14.708 --> 03:06:15.868]  So I want to get your take on this.
[03:06:16.409 --> 03:06:20.310]  What are a couple things that people need to know about Islam?
[03:06:20.410 --> 03:06:25.472]  Most Christians in America, evangelicals, are very, we don't know much about Islam.
[03:06:25.512 --> 03:06:26.772]  It's still foreign to us.
[03:06:27.152 --> 03:06:28.653]  It's making its encroachments.
[03:06:29.473 --> 03:06:33.175]  In the UK and in the EU by far way ahead of where we are.
[03:06:34.015 --> 03:06:40.057]  What do we need to understand about this religion in terms of let's start with maybe the Prophet Muhammad himself or so-called prophet.
[03:06:40.577 --> 03:06:52.442]  What are the things that people need to know because we're often told well he's just another prophet kind of like Moses or Isaiah and he's a preacher of against idolatry and he preaches monotheism.
[03:06:53.723 --> 03:06:53.903]  Yeah.
[03:06:54.403 --> 03:07:06.710]  Well, when we talk about so-called Prophet Muhammad, most Christians and Jews may not be aware that, according to Islamic tradition, he is the consummation, the fulfillment of the Judeo-Christian tradition.
[03:07:06.730 --> 03:07:07.470]  That's the assertion.
[03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:20.737]  So if anyone reads the Qur'an, and also read what is called the Sunnah of Muhammad, because Christians must keep in mind that just like Christianity is not a monolith, Islam is not a monolith.
[03:07:20.817 --> 03:07:23.418]  So there are groups within Islam, but the largest group
[03:07:24.068 --> 03:07:27.752]  About 85 percent, if not more, are identified as Sunni Muslims.
[03:07:28.153 --> 03:07:29.114]  So they're the dominant group.
[03:07:29.154 --> 03:07:30.656]  They follow what's called the Qur'an and the Sunnah.
[03:07:30.676 --> 03:07:33.799]  The Sunnah is these traditions attributed to Muhammad.
[03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:40.807]  So a Sunni looks to not just the Qur'an but to Muhammad's interpretation of the Qur'an as implementation, dos and don'ts.
[03:07:41.007 --> 03:07:43.310]  Now, in light of that, Muhammad claimed
[03:07:44.108 --> 03:07:48.676]  To have followed in the line of the Judeo-Christian prophets.
[03:07:49.136 --> 03:07:53.383]  And he claims that the nearest prophet to him, among all the prophets, was Jesus.
[03:07:53.884 --> 03:07:55.908]  So that according to his claim, they're all Muslims.
[03:07:56.408 --> 03:07:58.432]  Because the term Islam means submission and surrender.
[03:07:59.053 --> 03:08:01.915]  So, in the theological context, it means to surrender to the one true God.
[03:08:02.456 --> 03:08:15.266]  So, Islam claims that Allah of the Quran is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because Allah is simply, according to them, the Arabic term you would use for the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the God revealed in Jesus.
[03:08:15.746 --> 03:08:23.652]  So, according to Islam, Islam is the religion practiced by Adam, by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by Moses, and Jesus and his followers.
[03:08:23.792 --> 03:08:24.473]  In point of fact,
[03:08:25.126 --> 03:08:34.033]  If you go to chapter 3, verse 52 of the Qur'an, and chapter 5, verse 111, the Qur'an has Jesus' own followers saying to Jesus, bear witness, we are Muslims.
[03:08:34.514 --> 03:08:38.597]  So he is the consummation, the fulfillment of the religion.
[03:08:39.615 --> 03:08:43.416]  Passed on by the prophets, including Jesus, and he is the Seal of the Prophets.
[03:08:43.716 --> 03:08:50.817]  So now, with the coming of Muhammad, prophethood ends, messengership ends, and everyone is expected to submit to him.
[03:08:51.357 --> 03:09:04.800]  So this is the agenda of Islam, to bring the entire world under the fold of Islam, so that if you're a Jew or a Christian, and you hear about Muhammad, you must accept Muhammad because they claim he's prophesied in our Bible, even though they'll tell you our Bible's corrupt.
[03:09:05.402 --> 03:09:14.613]  But if you refuse to accept Muhammad, then you're allowed to pay what is called Jizya, so you can live under the hegemony of Islam under second or third rate conditions.
[03:09:14.994 --> 03:09:16.435]  And if you don't pay, they slaughter you.
[03:09:16.676 --> 03:09:18.658]  So this is basically who Muhammad is.
[03:09:18.958 --> 03:09:23.384]  The Seal of the Prophets, and everyone must follow him, because he's the last and universal messenger.
[03:09:24.583 --> 03:09:35.912]  You did a great talk that actually fit into what I talked about here in the fourth hour last week, which was about the three or four stages of Islamic jihad or invasion or a takeover.
[03:09:36.532 --> 03:09:40.535]  Could you maybe summarize that for the next few minutes here, your talk there?
[03:09:40.555 --> 03:09:42.617]  Because it fits very well with what I talked about last week.
[03:09:43.637 --> 03:09:44.038]  Exactly.
[03:09:44.858 --> 03:09:48.461]  As you indicated, Islam is also geopolitical.
[03:09:48.541 --> 03:09:49.462]  It's not just religion.
[03:09:49.622 --> 03:09:52.444]  It's a socio geopolitical economic system.
[03:09:52.624 --> 03:09:53.705]  It governs all of life.
[03:09:54.346 --> 03:09:58.130]  And Muhammad believed that his God sent him to conquer the world.
[03:09:58.250 --> 03:10:04.776]  In fact, there are traditions attributed to Muhammad where he says the entire earth belongs to Allah and his messenger.
[03:10:05.156 --> 03:10:06.157]  Messenger being Muhammad.
[03:10:06.698 --> 03:10:14.565]  Now, for the non-Muslims to understand these three stages, some like to divide them into four, you have to study the life of Muhammad.
[03:10:15.046 --> 03:10:16.287]  According to the Islamic tradition,
[03:10:16.909 --> 03:10:24.795]  Muhammad was born in Mecca, which is in Arabia, around 570 AD, claimed to be a prophet, 610, but he was outnumbered.
[03:10:26.036 --> 03:10:34.522]  Mecca was in the control of the unbelievers, they had the manpower, they had the financial prowess, so he was a small group, him and his few followers.
[03:10:35.023 --> 03:10:39.246]  During that stage, stage one, he preached coexistence.
[03:10:39.806 --> 03:10:45.270]  He preached to your religion to be my religion, because he knew he couldn't mount an offensive because they would squash him.
[03:10:45.951 --> 03:10:46.111]  Then,
[03:10:46.926 --> 03:10:52.189]  After 13 years in Mecca, he migrated to the north of Mecca called Medina.
[03:10:52.669 --> 03:10:57.511]  Now, it was actually called Yathrib, and it was a flourishing Jewish community, according to the Muslim sources.
[03:10:57.971 --> 03:11:01.913]  Eventually, he eradicated the Jewish presence, and the Muslims took over completely.
[03:11:01.953 --> 03:11:12.238]  Now, when he gets to Medina, 13 years later, he's the head of state, he now has enough manpower to now implement stage two, which is defensive jihad.
[03:11:12.819 --> 03:11:15.380]  You threaten our existence, you attack us, we have a right to attack you.
[03:11:16.323 --> 03:11:28.115]  Then, the last two years of his life, he was able to conquer Mecca, bring the entire Arabian Peninsula under his control, then he implemented Stage 3.
[03:11:28.755 --> 03:11:32.218]  Now, go spread Islam militarily, offensive jihad.
[03:11:32.579 --> 03:11:35.542]  So, depending on the situation and circumstances,
[03:11:36.102 --> 03:11:36.603]  We're good to go.
[03:11:56.423 --> 03:11:57.423]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[03:11:57.463 --> 03:12:03.826]  Now, this probably relates as well to the idea of the union with the left.
[03:12:03.926 --> 03:12:19.372]  Could you speak to that just for a minute, because that was something I covered as well last week, was how come Islam, which seems on the surface at least to be totally anti-liberalism, progressivism, LGBT, all that stuff, how is it that they make this alliance with the liberals?
[03:12:19.412 --> 03:12:21.512]  Why would liberals want an alliance with Islam?
[03:12:21.532 --> 03:12:23.073]  It doesn't make any sense on the surface.
[03:12:24.119 --> 03:12:28.203]  Well, you know this better than I. Anyone who's an enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[03:12:28.964 --> 03:12:36.372]  So, Islam will use any agenda, and the liberals will use any agenda, for the time being, to accomplish their purposes.
[03:12:36.412 --> 03:12:38.955]  So right now, they are what we call bed buddies.
[03:12:39.536 --> 03:12:42.579]  But when one of them dominates, the other one will be vanquished.
[03:12:43.169 --> 03:12:44.771]  So it serves their agenda and purpose.
[03:12:44.811 --> 03:12:53.060]  So, hey, if I can use liberal politics to infiltrate the West and bring in a strong Muslims until we outnumber them, so be it.
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:13:01.970]  So in the meantime, as Muslims live in the West, they will not straight up and tell you what their agenda is when they take control.
[03:13:02.708 --> 03:13:03.229]  Of an area?
[03:13:03.609 --> 03:13:05.451]  There'll be no homosexuality.
[03:13:05.791 --> 03:13:07.132]  There'll be no lesbianism.
[03:13:07.533 --> 03:13:08.994]  There'll be no transgenderism.
[03:13:09.014 --> 03:13:12.257]  Because under Islamic rule, these individuals are to be killed.
[03:13:12.418 --> 03:13:14.620]  And sometimes, in the most heinous manners.
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:19.765]  Because you'll find videos, where in Muslim countries, homosexuals are actually thrown off of buildings.
[03:13:20.894 --> 03:13:22.457]  Which is their form of punishment.
[03:13:22.877 --> 03:13:25.081]  So, why are they working together?
[03:13:25.181 --> 03:13:34.096]  Because one group is using the other group for the time being until they have enough ability to then implement and impose their agenda.
[03:13:34.236 --> 03:13:35.498]  And then they're going to turn against each other.
[03:13:36.374 --> 03:13:56.342]  Yeah, and that's a great segue to the next question, which is, we hear a lot of people online, I hear Sneko saying this all the time, oh, Christians and Muslims should unite together because, like Sam just said, right, if there's a rejection of sexual degeneracy, deviancy, and all of this, wouldn't we be on the same page to fight evil?
[03:13:56.742 --> 03:14:01.344]  What would you say to people who say that Christians and Muslims should unite together to, quote, fight evil?
[03:14:02.412 --> 03:14:15.397]  Yeah, only someone who's naive about the Islamic agenda would unite with Muslims in order to bring about so-called Judeo-Christian Islamic tradition because Muslims want to claim part of the Judeo-Christian heritage.
[03:14:16.198 --> 03:14:22.380]  However, just look at history and what Muslims have done to Christians when Muslims are the majority.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:29.203]  Once the Muslims are the majority, Christians are not allowed to build new churches or rebuild old ones.
[03:14:29.588 --> 03:14:30.648]  We're good to go.
[03:14:47.555 --> 03:14:54.921]  Now that they're in the minority, they will appeal to Jewish Christian sentiments and seek solidarity because it helps their purpose for now.
[03:14:55.301 --> 03:15:00.144]  But once they have the upper hand, they will subjugate and enslave anyone to the rule of Islam.
[03:15:00.224 --> 03:15:02.086]  So, don't you believe it!
[03:15:03.810 --> 03:15:28.869]  Yeah, this reminds me too of what I was doing an open forum debate the other day and I had a guy call in defending Islam and he said, well you're all lying over here on this side because when I read in the Quran there's multiple places where it says that Christians are viewed as worshippers of Allah as well, they're people of the book and they're pro-christian, they're not anti-christian, they love and allow all of these things
[03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:32.152]  That are monotheistic within a Muslim society.
[03:15:32.172 --> 03:15:40.601]  But that's not actually the case because the Hadith and other texts, the traditions, actually specify more than what's even in the Quran.
[03:15:40.621 --> 03:15:42.864]  And I would argue that the Quran just simply contradicts itself.
[03:15:42.944 --> 03:15:47.008]  On one place it will say, yeah, you gotta respect the people of the book.
[03:15:47.208 --> 03:15:51.493]  But then there's another place that says, but if they don't agree to this Islamic doctrine, they can be put to death.
[03:15:52.617 --> 03:16:00.066]  Yeah, now that's part of the three stages, and this needs to be elaborated, but I see we're coming on to the break, so I'll try to be brief, maybe pick it up after the break.
[03:16:00.847 --> 03:16:05.933]  Depending on which period of Muhammad's life the Qur'an was composed, the message will change.
[03:16:06.474 --> 03:16:11.580]  So when he's a minority in Mecca, he will talk about commonality with Jews and Christians.
[03:16:12.193 --> 03:16:18.339]  Then when he goes to Medina, he still will try to reach out to the Jews and Christians with the hopes that they'll embrace them.
[03:16:18.499 --> 03:16:30.150]  But when he sees the Jews and Christians don't buy it, then he turns against them, calls them idolaters, calls them the worst of creatures that need to be subjected and humiliated because this is all part of his political scheme.
[03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:31.311]  Try to win them.
[03:16:31.391 --> 03:16:34.914]  And if they don't believe in Muhammad, then when you have to apprehend, turn against them.
[03:16:36.395 --> 03:16:37.336]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:37.356 --> 03:16:37.776]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:37.817 --> 03:16:39.738]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:16:40.379 --> 03:16:52.649]  A limited edition exclusive InfoWars proprietary 24 karat .999 pure gold collectible is now available in this credit card size package laminated with original InfoWars art.

[03:17:40.123 --> 03:17:41.644]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:41.664 --> 03:17:43.546]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jaysonalysis.
[03:17:43.566 --> 03:17:47.268]  I want to remind you that you can get my books at jaysonalysis.com in the shop.
[03:17:47.288 --> 03:17:49.830]  Signed copies, every copy is a signed copy.
[03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:53.192]  I'm here today with my guest, Sam Shamoon.
[03:17:53.352 --> 03:17:55.494]  His channel is Shamoonian, and of course we just did
[03:17:56.321 --> 03:18:06.107]  A pretty big debate a couple nights ago over on the Fresh and Fit channel, Fresh and Fit podcast, where we had a three-hour discussion with a couple of the more prominent Muslim debaters.
[03:18:06.348 --> 03:18:21.297]  And before we went to the break, we were just discussing the history of Islam, the history of the strategies of geopolitical takeover that Islam uses, based actually on the life and the progression of Muhammad himself into becoming what he thought was a prophet.
[03:18:22.978 --> 03:18:37.491]  Before we go into maybe some of the religious beliefs and contradictions themselves, let's maybe put an end on the topic of the history by this issue of jihad, because a lot of times people will say, well, really Islam is a peaceful religion.
[03:18:37.511 --> 03:18:40.173]  It doesn't actually teach physical jihad.
[03:18:41.454 --> 03:18:42.975]  Sam, would you like to comment on that?
[03:18:43.075 --> 03:18:45.698]  Because I hear this all the time, especially from the left, right?
[03:18:45.718 --> 03:18:48.000]  They have this image of Islam as a religion of peace.
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:50.682]  Aren't there different senses of jihad?
[03:18:51.826 --> 03:18:51.966]  Yeah.
[03:18:52.306 --> 03:18:56.888]  Well, it is true there's different senses of jihad because jihad means struggle or to strive.
[03:18:57.008 --> 03:19:06.771]  However, both the Quran and the traditions attributed to Muhammad and Islamic history, and Muslims won't deny this, they'll just try to pass it off as defensive jihad.
[03:19:07.251 --> 03:19:09.072]  Jihad is also military.
[03:19:09.512 --> 03:19:10.232]  It's physical.
[03:19:10.632 --> 03:19:12.433]  It includes an army.
[03:19:12.613 --> 03:19:13.933]  It includes battles.
[03:19:14.114 --> 03:19:16.194]  It includes physical attack and onslaught.
[03:19:16.614 --> 03:19:18.415]  So when they say that jihad
[03:19:19.145 --> 03:19:20.426]  is merely spiritual.
[03:19:20.927 --> 03:19:23.288]  They're pretty much sticking their head in the sand.
[03:19:23.729 --> 03:19:30.854]  They're ignoring the very context of the Qur'an itself and they're ignoring also traditions attributed to Muhammad and the expeditions he carried out.
[03:19:31.095 --> 03:19:35.598]  There are even books about the military campaigns of Muhammad and moreover Islamic history.
[03:19:36.119 --> 03:19:40.762]  One of the last chapters, if not the last chapters, of the Qur'an composed according to Islamic chronology.
[03:19:40.822 --> 03:19:43.785]  This is something all serious students of Islam must know.
[03:19:44.637 --> 03:19:46.018]  The Quran is divided into two periods.
[03:19:46.258 --> 03:19:50.601]  The Meccan period, where Muhammad was a minority, and the Medinan period, when he's the majority.
[03:19:51.582 --> 03:19:54.524]  You'll see the tone changes from the Meccan to Medinan period.
[03:19:54.724 --> 03:19:57.225]  Meccan period, to you, your religion, to me, my religion.
[03:19:57.586 --> 03:20:00.427]  Medinan period, they harassed you, now you can fight back.
[03:20:01.128 --> 03:20:03.409]  And now, spread Islam and subjugate the world.
[03:20:04.170 --> 03:20:08.753]  This chapter, chapter 9, if it's not the last chapter, it's one of the last chapters composed,
[03:20:09.554 --> 03:20:15.117]  All of the other chapters of the Qur'an begins with the formula, in the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent.
[03:20:15.557 --> 03:20:29.564]  This is the only chapter that doesn't begin with that formula, because the Muslim commentators say, this chapter doesn't offer any mercy, it doesn't offer any compassion, it is a warning to the idolaters, Jews and Christians, submit or else, or else.
[03:20:30.350 --> 03:20:42.934]  And if anyone reads chapter 9 verses 28 to 33, just that small section, there Muhammad is inciting the jihadis to fight against Jews and Christians, not because the Jews and Christians attacked them.
[03:20:43.195 --> 03:20:43.555]  Go read it.
[03:20:43.935 --> 03:20:44.835]  It's right there contextually.
[03:20:44.875 --> 03:20:45.695]  Go read the commentaries.
[03:20:46.116 --> 03:20:46.976]  It's because of their belief.
[03:20:47.705 --> 03:20:59.271]  The grounds of subjugating is because Muhammad accuses the Jews of believing Ezra is the son of Allah, blasphemy according to Islam, taking the rabbis as lords besides Allah, blasphemy according to Islam.
[03:20:59.651 --> 03:21:09.536]  Christians believe that Jesus, son of God, blasphemy according to Islam, and they take their monks as lords, and for that reason, they need to be attacked, become Muslim, or pay jizya and feel humiliated.
[03:21:10.016 --> 03:21:13.798]  So this notion, there is no such thing as physical jihad, I don't know.
[03:21:14.378 --> 03:21:16.379]  I guess the color of the sky in their world is purple.
[03:21:18.641 --> 03:21:25.351]  Yeah, let's move on to some of the theological issues, some of the beliefs that are odd and at odds with Christianity.
[03:21:25.391 --> 03:21:32.121]  I think two of the most glaring that you often highlight is, first of all, is probably the Islamic dilemma as it's known, which is that
[03:21:32.734 --> 03:21:40.060]  The Qur'an many times over actually says that you can look to prior revelation in the Bible to confirm this teaching of the Qur'an.
[03:21:40.100 --> 03:21:48.427]  However, when we go to the Bible, of course, it teaches the Trinity, it teaches the deity of Christ, which the Qur'an says is idolatry and polytheism.
[03:21:48.467 --> 03:21:50.729]  So clearly the Bible doesn't teach the Qur'an.
[03:21:50.769 --> 03:21:56.154]  And then the dilemma is then, well, how would I go to a book that you believe is corrupt
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:21:59.722]  Uh, to confirm the new revelation, right?
[03:21:59.762 --> 03:22:01.503]  How could a corrupt thing confirm the new thing?
[03:22:01.903 --> 03:22:03.644]  So basically they're on the horns of a dilemma.
[03:22:03.684 --> 03:22:04.445]  Could you speak to that?
[03:22:04.485 --> 03:22:07.827]  I know you've heard a lot of, have you ever heard a Muslim give a good response to this?
[03:22:08.808 --> 03:22:09.368]  Absolutely not.
[03:22:09.688 --> 03:22:13.070]  In fact, that was one of our main arguments in the debate and you saw what happened.
[03:22:13.090 --> 03:22:14.631]  They floundered like fish out of water.
[03:22:15.172 --> 03:22:15.372]  Yes.
[03:22:15.672 --> 03:22:24.198]  Uh, if you study the Quran and the tradition to Muhammad and you just study them, not later Muslim interpretation or later Muslim,
[03:22:25.396 --> 03:22:26.537]  Spin on the sources.
[03:22:27.077 --> 03:22:40.324]  The Qur'an clearly provides one line of evidence for Muhammad's messengership in that Muhammad and his Qur'an confirm, agree with the scriptures and the possession of the Jews and Christians.
[03:22:40.624 --> 03:22:51.389]  Now, historically, we know that the only scriptures Jews and Christians have had at the time Muhammad, before Muhammad, even before Christ with the discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls, are the scriptures you and I read today.
[03:22:51.709 --> 03:22:52.510]  So, according to Muhammad,
[03:22:53.010 --> 03:22:54.630]  Those scriptures are uncorrupt.
[03:22:54.990 --> 03:23:01.192]  Those scriptures preserved by His God, Allah, and that the sign of His prophethood is that His Qur'an agrees with those scriptures.
[03:23:01.552 --> 03:23:03.412]  So He's calling the Jews and Christians, hey, accept me.
[03:23:03.852 --> 03:23:04.072]  Why?
[03:23:04.373 --> 03:23:05.673]  My Qur'an agrees with your scriptures.
[03:23:06.233 --> 03:23:10.774]  The problem is when the Jews and Christians told Muhammad, no, you don't.
[03:23:11.434 --> 03:23:12.654]  You don't agree with our scriptures.
[03:23:13.034 --> 03:23:14.615]  Your theology doesn't agree with our scriptures.
[03:23:14.795 --> 03:23:15.415]  Your Qur'an doesn't.
[03:23:15.775 --> 03:23:19.936]  He then blamed them for misinterpreting, not corrupting the text.
[03:23:20.635 --> 03:23:30.343]  You go to chapter 3, verse 78 of the Qur'an, it says, So, that was Muhammad's argument.
[03:23:30.423 --> 03:23:33.606]  It wasn't that you corrupted the book, it's you're misinterpreting the book.
[03:23:33.766 --> 03:23:36.668]  So, if you let me interpret the book, then you'll become Muslim.
[03:23:36.788 --> 03:23:39.170]  In fact, that happened in our debate, if you remember, with Ijaz.
[03:23:39.771 --> 03:23:40.972]  At the end, what did he say?
[03:23:41.372 --> 03:23:43.694]  Yes, this corrupt Bible that he was trashing.
[03:23:44.289 --> 03:23:45.650]  Confirms Muhammad is a prophet.
[03:23:46.111 --> 03:23:47.832]  And I go, oh, you mean the same corrupt Bible?
[03:23:48.072 --> 03:23:51.755]  He goes, oh yeah, the Bible is true when it agrees with our theology.
[03:23:52.756 --> 03:23:54.057]  If you remember that, he did that in debate.
[03:23:54.437 --> 03:23:57.960]  So, this is the... Precisely, circle of reasoning.
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:02.804]  This destroys Islam in that, if Muhammad says the Bible is true,
[03:24:03.763 --> 03:24:06.384]  And the Bible shows that Muhammad's doctrines are false.
[03:24:06.824 --> 03:24:07.384]  The gig is up.
[03:24:07.464 --> 03:24:08.325]  Muhammad is a false prophet.
[03:24:08.705 --> 03:24:12.346]  But if they say the Bible is corrupt, that means they're disagreeing with Muhammad.
[03:24:12.886 --> 03:24:14.326]  That means they know more than Muhammad.
[03:24:14.407 --> 03:24:14.987]  Muhammad is wrong.
[03:24:15.167 --> 03:24:15.767]  The gig is up.
[03:24:16.227 --> 03:24:17.147]  Muhammad is a false prophet.
[03:24:17.528 --> 03:24:18.148]  Damn if you do.
[03:24:18.288 --> 03:24:18.828]  Damn if you don't.
[03:24:20.166 --> 03:24:30.191]  Another thing that I think many Christians and people in the West don't know is the history of the attempt to create a single Quranic version.
[03:24:31.371 --> 03:24:34.933]  I didn't know this until I really started looking into Islam a few years ago.
[03:24:35.833 --> 03:24:44.055]  This is the whole history of Uthman and the burning, and they often make this argument that, well, we have a perfectly preserved history of the Quran.
[03:24:44.095 --> 03:25:01.759]  The Bible has a lot of thousands of manuscripts from the first few centuries, therefore we have a superior revelation, which itself is actually fraudulent, because if the argument is that it needs to be closer to the time of the revelation to be accurate, well, the Gospels are actually far closer to the time of Christ.
[03:25:02.339 --> 03:25:02.739]  Precisely.
[03:25:02.819 --> 03:25:05.441]  Again, this is all based on Muslim sources, not Islamophobic literature.
[03:25:32.034 --> 03:25:36.337]  For example, as I mentioned earlier, the largest sect of Islam would be the Sunni sect.
[03:25:36.717 --> 03:25:37.918]  So they follow the Qur'an and Sunnah.
[03:25:38.318 --> 03:25:47.404]  They have a set of traditions that they have classified whether sound, absolutely reliable, good, weak, or forgeries.
[03:25:47.944 --> 03:25:55.109]  The information I'm giving is based on what they deem to be the most authentic sound narrations that they claim can go back to Muhammad.
[03:25:55.149 --> 03:25:57.070]  Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and others.
[03:25:57.570 --> 03:25:58.711]  According to their sources,
[03:25:59.429 --> 03:26:12.025]  When Muhammad died, his own companions, people that followed Muhammad, learned the Qur'an from Muhammad, were now writing down what they learned from Muhammad in manuscripts, their version of the Qur'an, and they were in conflict.
[03:26:12.686 --> 03:26:14.067]  The differences were so bad.
[03:26:14.087 --> 03:26:16.791]  And by the way, for the Muslims who think I'm lying, I'll even give you the reference.
[03:26:17.412 --> 03:26:22.176]  If you go online, sunnah.com, Sahih al-Bukhari, volume 6, numbers 509, 510.
[03:26:22.876 --> 03:26:24.377]  That's all you need to remember.
[03:26:24.557 --> 03:26:29.901]  Sahih al-Bukhari, volume 6, number 510, and then read 509 before you read 510.
[03:26:30.842 --> 03:26:37.647]  And there it says that the differences were so great, and these are Qurans written down by Muhammad's companions, that they almost came to blows.
[03:26:38.456 --> 03:26:40.838]  Because they're accusing the others of corrupting the Qur'an.
[03:26:41.258 --> 03:26:44.641]  So much for memorization, preserving the Qur'an, because that's another canard.
[03:26:44.961 --> 03:26:46.883]  Well, they memorized the Qur'an and preserved it.
[03:26:46.963 --> 03:26:51.326]  Well, Muhammad's companions, when they wrote down what they memorized, full of contradictions.
[03:26:51.727 --> 03:26:58.092]  So, the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, third caliph, decided, and this is around 650 AD.
[03:26:58.172 --> 03:26:59.613]  Now, this is according to Sunni tradition.
[03:27:00.113 --> 03:27:02.055]  If you go to Orientalist scholars or
[03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:07.438]  Islamist scholars who are not committed to the Sunni tradition, they don't believe much of these traditions.
[03:27:07.458 --> 03:27:08.318]  They believe it's forgeries.
[03:27:08.598 --> 03:27:14.479]  Because the sources that contain these traditions are nearly 20 years removed from the time of Muhammad's reported life.
[03:27:14.939 --> 03:27:17.460]  So they take them with a pinch of salt.
[03:27:17.580 --> 03:27:21.900]  But with that said, Uthman decided to standardize one Quran.
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:25.861]  A Quran compiled by a man named Zayd ibn Thabit.
[03:27:26.421 --> 03:27:31.962]  Now Zayd converted to Islam years later after Muhammad went to Medina.
[03:27:32.899 --> 03:27:34.981]  And so he decided to standardize that Qur'an.
[03:27:35.021 --> 03:27:39.744]  Now, there were other Muslims who had been Muslims from the time of Mecca, way before Zayid.
[03:27:40.004 --> 03:27:41.726]  One in particular named Abdullah ibn Masud.
[03:27:42.386 --> 03:27:50.812]  He learned the Qur'an, he mastered its recitation, and even Muhammad's companions say, among all the Muslims, he and another man named Ubayy were the best.
[03:27:51.513 --> 03:27:55.496]  When he wrote down the Qur'an, his Qur'an contradicted Zayid's, and he refused to give it up.
[03:27:55.976 --> 03:27:57.377]  Uthman demanded they be burned.
[03:27:57.857 --> 03:27:58.438]  He didn't want to.
[03:27:59.230 --> 03:28:07.188]  It got to the point that Uthman insulted this man, Abdullah, who was a companion of Muhammad, and they were companions, and started a riot.
[03:28:07.308 --> 03:28:07.949]  He got beat.
[03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:09.994]  He had his ribs broken because of it.
[03:28:10.646 --> 03:28:13.909]  So, Uthman decided, this is the Qur'an we'll follow.
[03:28:14.410 --> 03:28:16.452]  All the other Qur'ans need to be burned.
[03:28:16.832 --> 03:28:22.678]  Who gave him the authority to burn down Qur'ans that Muhammad's own companions learned from Muhammad directly?
[03:28:23.038 --> 03:28:27.663]  Thank God no Christian ever had a Christian Uthman doing that to the Bible.
[03:28:27.983 --> 03:28:28.824]  But then it gets worse.
[03:28:29.405 --> 03:28:34.390]  That so-called Uthmanic recension, when it was transmitted, it came down
[03:28:35.552 --> 03:28:43.847]  To the Muslims in at least 25 different Arabic variant forms of that Uthmanic text.
[03:28:44.731 --> 03:28:49.875]  300 years after the death of Muhammad, a man named Ibn Mujahid decided, I want to standardize 7 of the 25.
[03:28:50.635 --> 03:28:52.416]  Once again, by what authority?
[03:28:52.716 --> 03:28:53.517]  He's not a prophet.
[03:28:53.677 --> 03:28:54.458]  He's not a messenger.
[03:28:54.778 --> 03:28:55.678]  Who gave him that right?
[03:28:56.159 --> 03:29:03.243]  So even Muslims will admit that the present Arabic Quran, you can't trace it any earlier than Uthman.
[03:29:03.684 --> 03:29:10.688]  And even then, they have at least 7 different Arabic variants that are not 100% consistent with one another.
[03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:13.430]  So much for perfect preservation.
[03:29:14.033 --> 03:29:14.773]  Right, yeah.
[03:29:14.833 --> 03:29:21.036]  And by the way, even if theoretically there were perfect preservation, I mean, error can be perfectly preserved as well.
[03:29:21.737 --> 03:29:25.178]  So it wouldn't necessarily prove anything even if it were the case.
[03:29:25.198 --> 03:29:27.319]  And of course, it's not the case according to the Hadiths.
[03:29:27.399 --> 03:29:36.143]  Now, could you speak maybe a little bit to this issue of, well, isn't Iran is a Shia version of Islam versus Sunni?
[03:29:36.203 --> 03:29:37.644]  Because the reason I bring that up is,
[03:29:38.284 --> 03:29:47.474]  Well, when we listen to a lot of the debates, it's usually sold in the West as a very simple, easy to understand religion, and everybody can get behind the idea that God is one.
[03:29:48.177 --> 03:29:52.939]  But they always downplay the fact that Muslims have been fighting each other for centuries.
[03:29:53.479 --> 03:30:00.222]  And they fight each other over a very minutiae that, in their own view, would be the attributes of Allah.
[03:30:00.242 --> 03:30:02.103]  Does Allah have a hand, a shin, a foot?
[03:30:02.583 --> 03:30:03.783]  They'll go to blows.
[03:30:03.823 --> 03:30:04.984]  They'll go to war over that.
[03:30:05.164 --> 03:30:08.265]  But they present it in the West like, well, we all agree.
[03:30:08.325 --> 03:30:10.306]  We're all united on there being one Islam.
[03:30:11.713 --> 03:30:12.554]  Yeah.
[03:30:12.614 --> 03:30:18.498]  In Iran, as you said, they identify with the Shia sect, which is the second largest sect of Islam.
[03:30:19.198 --> 03:30:25.123]  And like I said, over 80 percent, some would even push it close to 90 percent, identify with Sunni Islam.
[03:30:25.143 --> 03:30:25.963]  And I have to be careful.
[03:30:26.604 --> 03:30:29.886]  Just because someone says he or she is a Sunni doesn't mean they understand their tradition.
[03:30:30.426 --> 03:30:32.208]  You have a lot of Christians who understand their tradition.
[03:30:32.228 --> 03:30:35.690]  So I'm just saying, statistically, they would identify with this version of Islam.
[03:30:35.810 --> 03:30:37.211]  Doesn't mean they're educated.
[03:30:37.651 --> 03:30:38.372]  Now, the Shia
[03:30:39.426 --> 03:30:46.610]  ...are the intellectual heirs of a group of Muslims that started flourishing in the 700s, 800s, called the Mutazilites.
[03:30:47.431 --> 03:30:48.291]  The Mutazila.
[03:30:48.792 --> 03:30:50.873]  So they are the heirs of that particular group.
[03:30:50.913 --> 03:30:59.498]  Now, the Mutazilites were heavily influenced by Aristotelian, Neoplatonic philosophy and logic, and that's your forte.
[03:31:00.333 --> 03:31:10.385]  Now, the Metezalites, because of the influence of Aristotelian logic, denied any real distinct attributes in the essence of their god, Allah.
[03:31:11.125 --> 03:31:15.050]  The other group that wasn't trained in Greek philosophy logic,
[03:31:15.803 --> 03:31:28.347]  Affirmed that Allah has an essence, that, and he has attributes, and the attributes are not identical to the essence, and the attributes are not identical to one another, and one of those attributes happens to be the Qur'an, because the Qur'an is the speech of Allah.
[03:31:28.847 --> 03:31:31.128]  So they reason, if the Qur'an is the speech of Allah, it's uncreated.
[03:31:31.628 --> 03:31:33.349]  The other group said, you're polytheists.
[03:31:34.189 --> 03:31:42.192]  If you're saying that Allah has distinct attributes, and they're not identical, and the Qur'an is one of them, you're now destroying absolute unicity.
[03:31:43.306 --> 03:31:44.666]  And you're doing what the Christians are doing.
[03:31:44.766 --> 03:31:46.067]  In fact, they even leveled this charge.
[03:31:46.507 --> 03:31:48.588]  You're saying to the Qur'an what the Christians say about Jesus.
[03:31:48.928 --> 03:31:51.348]  Jesus is the Logos, the word who became flesh.
[03:31:51.728 --> 03:31:55.850]  You're saying the Logos or the Kalam, the word became a book.
[03:31:56.190 --> 03:31:57.250]  So you're not true monotheist.
[03:31:57.950 --> 03:32:05.592]  And depending on who was in power, there's something in Islamic tradition, and I want non-Muslims to confirm to see if I'm lying, it's called the Mihna.
[03:32:06.273 --> 03:32:06.713]  Mihna.
[03:32:07.413 --> 03:32:10.994]  Around the 800s, the Caliphs were Mutazilites.
[03:32:12.014 --> 03:32:18.656]  You had Caliph al-Ma'mun, he was imprisoning, torturing and killing any Muslim who said the Qur'an is uncreated.
[03:32:19.817 --> 03:32:22.617]  And then followed by successor al-Muttam who did the same.
[03:32:23.138 --> 03:32:30.140]  So they even imprisoned and killed Muslims depending on their view of the essence of Allah, the attributes and the Qur'an.
[03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:36.802]  So this claim that Allah is absolutely one and there is no disagreement, that does not chide with their own Islamic sources.
[03:32:37.984 --> 03:32:44.706]  Yeah, even in the debate they downplayed that fact, acting as if they're all on the same page, and of course they're not.
[03:32:45.206 --> 03:32:48.587]  In fact, there's even disagreements on how to rule on the moral matters.
[03:32:48.787 --> 03:32:54.509]  So Islam is not this unified thing, but they sell it as a very simple unified thing in the West, is the key point here.
[03:32:54.549 --> 03:32:58.290]  Now, another issue that really seems to, I think, rattle a lot of people is the
[03:32:59.270 --> 03:33:09.112]  Comparison of the morality between Christ and Muhammad and when people really look into that that seems to that seems to shake people More than a lot of the more high theological topics.
[03:33:09.452 --> 03:33:12.533]  Could you talk about the comparison between the morality of?
[03:33:13.313 --> 03:33:20.575]  Muhammad versus what Christ taught and then for example, we just saw in Iraq They just passed a law to be able to marry at age 9.
[03:33:21.335 --> 03:33:22.655]  Could you speak to some of these issues?
[03:33:22.675 --> 03:33:22.695]  I
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:24.561]  Absolutely.
[03:33:24.601 --> 03:33:29.845]  In fact, I can confirm most Muslims leave Islam because of the morality of Muhammad.
[03:33:30.526 --> 03:33:35.109]  So, if you want to get Muslims to leave Muhammad, it's the morality issue, not so much the theological issue.
[03:33:35.990 --> 03:33:38.092]  So, what's the problem with Muhammad and Jesus?
[03:33:38.132 --> 03:33:40.033]  Well, let me start with Muhammad.
[03:33:40.514 --> 03:33:52.784]  The reason why Iraq passed that law, again, according to the so-called authentic traditions attributed to Muhammad and the Qur'an, in chapter 65, verse 4 of the Qur'an, there's legislation.
[03:33:53.422 --> 03:33:56.104]  Governing on what you do when you marry minors.
[03:33:56.485 --> 03:34:00.448]  It even says, women who have not yet had their periods.
[03:34:02.009 --> 03:34:07.474]  Meaning, they are so young, they are premature, and yet they're being married off.
[03:34:09.035 --> 03:34:10.496]  The men are consummating the marriage.
[03:34:11.037 --> 03:34:12.278]  I know I got to keep it D-rated.
[03:34:12.918 --> 03:34:13.779]  Divorcing them.
[03:34:13.979 --> 03:34:16.001]  So how long should they wait to be remarried?
[03:34:16.619 --> 03:34:18.980]  So, Islam sanctions pedophilia.
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:19.460]  It's there.
[03:34:20.060 --> 03:34:30.563]  In fact, if you go to the four main Islamic schools of jurisprudence in Sunni Islam, they tell you the only condition for marriage, for a girl, is if she can handle penetration.
[03:34:31.244 --> 03:34:32.404]  And that varies from age to age.
[03:34:32.604 --> 03:34:33.644]  I mean, I know it's sick.
[03:34:33.704 --> 03:34:36.485]  I don't know what I can say on the show, but absolutely sick.
[03:34:36.525 --> 03:34:38.586]  Meaning, she can be as young as six or seven.
[03:34:39.187 --> 03:34:42.870]  But if she can't handle it, wait, be gentle until she can handle penetration.
[03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:43.230]  Why?
[03:34:43.250 --> 03:34:44.951]  Because her example is Muhammad.
[03:34:45.051 --> 03:34:51.236]  According to the tradition, Muhammad I, Aisha, Aisha was the daughter of his so-called best friend.
[03:34:51.796 --> 03:35:01.043]  She was six years old when he wrote the marriage contract, but he had to wait till nine to consummate it because that's the age where she can handle penetration.
[03:35:01.063 --> 03:35:04.186]  So puberty for them is when you can handle penetration by a grown man.
[03:35:04.566 --> 03:35:05.827]  And Muhammad is 54 years old.
[03:35:06.387 --> 03:35:08.209]  So this is one gross
[03:35:09.105 --> 03:35:19.430]  Practice, not only Mohammed carried out, but it's in the Quran, which is why Muslims who want to follow strictly the Sharia cannot condemn marriages to nine-year-olds.
[03:35:19.610 --> 03:35:21.171]  They can't do it because they're condemning Mohammed.
[03:35:21.231 --> 03:35:21.771]  So that's one.
[03:35:22.051 --> 03:35:27.974]  Second thing Mohammed did, and this is not as well known, Mohammed had an adopted son named Zayed.
[03:35:29.065 --> 03:35:29.745]  He adopted him.
[03:35:30.105 --> 03:35:30.766]  He married them all.
[03:35:31.266 --> 03:35:37.949]  The Muslim sources say that one day Muhammad saw his adopted son's wife and he started lusting for her.
[03:35:38.489 --> 03:35:40.410]  And she noticed that he was drawn to her beauty.
[03:35:41.010 --> 03:35:42.391]  She told her husband.
[03:35:43.081 --> 03:35:46.322]  He then went to his adoptive father and said, look, I'll divorce her for your sake.
[03:35:46.562 --> 03:35:47.302]  No, no, no, keep her.
[03:35:47.542 --> 03:35:48.363]  Divorce her anyway.
[03:35:48.903 --> 03:35:57.685]  And then a verse comes down in the Qur'an, chapter 33, verse 37, saying, You hid Muhammad, what we're about to make known, that we wanted you to marry her.
[03:35:57.745 --> 03:35:58.026]  Why?
[03:35:58.186 --> 03:35:59.386]  Now, notice the logic of Allah.
[03:36:00.066 --> 03:36:01.447]  We wanted you to set precedence.
[03:36:01.907 --> 03:36:02.607]  What's the precedence?
[03:36:03.231 --> 03:36:11.782]  That when he divorces her, you marry her so there'll be no fault in adoptive fathers marrying the divorced wives of their adopted sons.
[03:36:11.823 --> 03:36:13.044]  Now tell me how sick that is.
[03:36:13.585 --> 03:36:19.493]  You have an adopted son, he divorces his wife, you take her to bed, now she becomes his stepmother.
[03:36:19.953 --> 03:36:20.654]  But this is Islam.
[03:36:21.134 --> 03:36:21.995]  Now it gets even worse.
[03:36:22.656 --> 03:36:25.118]  Shortly thereafter, Allah abolishes adoption.
[03:36:25.438 --> 03:36:26.339]  He goes, there's no more adoption.
[03:36:26.739 --> 03:36:27.720]  Zayd is no more your son.
[03:36:27.940 --> 03:36:29.602]  Stop calling them your son.
[03:36:29.782 --> 03:36:30.062]  Why?
[03:36:30.282 --> 03:36:30.983]  To save face.
[03:36:31.323 --> 03:36:34.907]  Because people kept attacking him saying, how could you take your son's wife?
[03:36:35.267 --> 03:36:38.250]  Well, he's not really my son after all, and I end adoption.
[03:36:38.590 --> 03:36:40.632]  But wait, Jay, you know logic better than me.
[03:36:41.381 --> 03:36:52.332]  I thought the reason why he married his adopted son's wife was to set a precedence that other adoptive fathers could marry the wives of their adopted sons when they're divorced.
[03:36:52.832 --> 03:36:57.457]  But if Allah's all-knowing, didn't Allah know he was going to then abolish adoption later?
[03:36:57.877 --> 03:37:02.081]  So what kind of example is he setting when adoption is now cancelled?
[03:37:02.422 --> 03:37:03.783]  And then notice the inhumanity.
[03:37:04.103 --> 03:37:05.545]  Because of Muhammad's lust,
[03:37:06.549 --> 03:37:15.394]  Muslims cannot adopt orphans and orphans cannot be adopted into homes because adoption is not permitted in Islam.
[03:37:15.794 --> 03:37:18.596]  And yet the God revealed in Jesus loves adoption.
[03:37:18.656 --> 03:37:20.157]  He adopts us as his sons and daughters.
[03:37:20.437 --> 03:37:22.478]  So adoption is part of the Christian heritage.
[03:37:22.978 --> 03:37:24.679]  So these are just some of the aspects.
[03:37:25.079 --> 03:37:27.841]  I can go a little more, but if you wanted to say something before I give you another example.
[03:37:28.746 --> 03:37:33.467]  Well, I mean, it reminds me, too, of just, you know, sort of fundamental contradictions.
[03:37:33.687 --> 03:37:46.771]  You talk about logic, you know, Muslims believe, for example, that Jesus was a worshipper of Allah, and yet we have multiple times, many, many times throughout the Gospels, Christ claims to be the Son of God.
[03:37:47.472 --> 03:37:50.553]  Of course, in the Koran, we're told that Allah has no sons.
[03:37:50.793 --> 03:37:58.636]  So how could Allah be the God of Jesus when Jesus says many, many times over that he's the Son of God and that we become sons of God?
[03:37:59.097 --> 03:38:04.499]  That proves that Allah is not the God of Jesus, and so Jesus is not in any continuity with Islam.
[03:38:05.599 --> 03:38:14.763]  So, I mean, I know that's getting back into the theological issues, but it's another contrast on that point of sons and adoption and grace that, of course, Islam does not believe in.
[03:38:15.911 --> 03:38:16.391]  Precisely.
[03:38:16.732 --> 03:38:25.678]  And just to piggyback off of what you said, to say that Jesus, son of God, is one of the grounds for Muslims to carry out jihad on Christians, that's chapter 9, verse 29.
[03:38:26.419 --> 03:38:35.846]  If you say Jesus, son of Allah, that is one of the reasons why Muslims must carry out jihad on Christian lands and subjugate them, because that's the height of blasphemy.
[03:38:36.166 --> 03:38:40.469]  Because the highest relationship a person can have with Allah is a slave-to-master relationship.
[03:38:41.067 --> 03:38:45.369]  And therefore, Jesus says, if all you are is a slave, you have no permanent place in the Master's house.
[03:38:45.709 --> 03:38:53.091]  So it's not just theological, it even affects the political, social, economic atmosphere that we live in.
[03:38:53.491 --> 03:39:03.635]  Because that's the reason why Muslims cannot rest until the West is subjugated to the rule of Islam, and stop this nonsense of saying, Jesus is God's son, and we're the sons and daughters of God.
[03:39:04.115 --> 03:39:06.376]  Now I can mention another aspect, but do you want to say something before?
[03:39:06.932 --> 03:39:20.643]  Well, I was just going to say that this reminds me of, I don't know if you saw that clip of Sneako and Mohamed Adjab where Sneako asked Mohamed Adjab that the topic came up of what's worse, a Christian or somebody who's living in homosexual relationships.
[03:39:21.144 --> 03:39:23.526]  And Mohamed Adjab said that it's actually worse to be a Christian.
[03:39:24.006 --> 03:39:36.851]  And everybody was surprised at this, which I think demonstrates why you could never have Chrislam and this melding of the two, is because they believe the idolatry within Christianity, believing that Jesus is the Son of God, is worse than a homosexual situation.
[03:39:37.612 --> 03:39:38.573]  Absolutely!
[03:39:38.793 --> 03:39:39.854]  That's 100%.
[03:39:39.934 --> 03:39:40.875]  The worst blasphemy.
[03:39:41.136 --> 03:39:42.677]  Because homosexuality can be forgiven.
[03:39:43.198 --> 03:39:49.123]  But when you commit what they call shirk, associating a partner with Allah, like he has a divine son, Allah will never forgive that.
[03:39:49.324 --> 03:39:51.346]  So they were being faithful to their religious texts.
[03:39:51.526 --> 03:39:52.767]  So, absolutely right.
[03:39:52.947 --> 03:39:55.750]  In Islam, homosexuality is heinous, but you can repent.
[03:39:56.420 --> 03:40:02.904]  But if you openly profess Jesus is God's son, that is a sin that's much more heinous and Allah will not forgive you.
[03:40:03.224 --> 03:40:04.405]  So, exactly spot on.
[03:40:04.425 --> 03:40:07.046]  Now, one more aspect, because this is not just theological.
[03:40:07.066 --> 03:40:08.347]  It's not just in the realm of theology.
[03:40:08.927 --> 03:40:13.530]  It's being carried out right now by ISIS, by Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, you name it.
[03:40:14.491 --> 03:40:24.757]  In chapter 4, verse 24 of the Qur'an, Muslims are allowed, if they're carrying out military expeditions, and go ask the survivors in Iraq or Syria, the Levant, they saw this with their own eyes.
[03:40:25.422 --> 03:40:29.225]  A jihadi, when he attacks a place, can take a woman, even a married woman.
[03:40:29.325 --> 03:40:30.506]  This is in the Qur'an, in the tradition.
[03:40:31.166 --> 03:40:32.007]  Even if she's married.
[03:40:32.907 --> 03:40:35.669]  And then he can... Can I say the word R.A.P.?
[03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:36.950]  Grape?
[03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:39.412]  Because I don't know if... Okay.
[03:40:39.572 --> 03:40:40.072]  Grape her.
[03:40:40.732 --> 03:40:40.973]  Okay.
[03:40:41.153 --> 03:40:41.833]  Grape her.
[03:40:42.574 --> 03:40:47.997]  He can grape her, even married, because when he takes her captive, that nullifies their marriage.
[03:40:48.518 --> 03:40:50.139]  Grape her at will and sell her off.
[03:40:50.791 --> 03:40:54.554]  This is what's happening now in places like Afghanistan and Nigeria.
[03:40:54.594 --> 03:40:56.615]  So, it's not just theological, folks.
[03:40:57.095 --> 03:41:08.463]  We're talking about stuff that actually impacts our lives today, and there are women who have been taken captive, even married women, and have been graped, because this is what Allah and His Messenger condemned.
[03:41:08.643 --> 03:41:11.465]  Something condemned even in the Old Testament, in Deuteronomy 21, 10 and 14.
[03:41:14.491 --> 03:41:16.895]  Yeah, I want to thank you for joining me today, Sam.
[03:41:16.915 --> 03:41:18.298]  This was a great conversation.
[03:41:18.318 --> 03:41:27.934]  Any of the last 30, 40 seconds you want to tell us things about Islam and then maybe where people can find you and what you would recommend?
[03:41:29.187 --> 03:41:30.228]  Yes.
[03:41:30.388 --> 03:41:32.289]  You can find me on my YouTube channel Shamoonian.
[03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:33.650]  I'm also on Rumble.
[03:41:33.870 --> 03:41:34.791]  It's Answering Islam.
[03:41:35.271 --> 03:41:40.535]  I also have a blog where you can find articles with all these references there free of charge.
[03:41:40.775 --> 03:41:42.797]  Answering Islam blog.
[03:41:43.277 --> 03:41:45.299]  Answeringislamblog.wordpress.com.
[03:41:46.119 --> 03:41:50.903]  The only thing I want to say is I don't want to generalize in the sense that I'm not saying every Muslim believes this.
[03:41:51.183 --> 03:41:52.784]  Most Muslims are ignorant of their tradition.
[03:41:53.225 --> 03:41:56.868]  In fact, the women and children are actually victims of the Islamic system.
[03:41:57.288 --> 03:42:00.410]  We need to do all we can to stop Islam and set these people free.
[03:42:00.791 --> 03:42:04.834]  And the only way to do so is through the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our God and Savior and King.
[03:42:05.214 --> 03:42:05.855]  And I love you, brother.
[03:42:05.875 --> 03:42:06.535]  Thank you for having me.
[03:42:07.416 --> 03:42:07.616]  All right.
[03:42:07.656 --> 03:42:08.216]  Thank you, everybody.
[03:42:08.276 --> 03:42:12.520]  Be sure to head over to the InfoWars store and buy those products to support InfoWars.
[03:42:12.680 --> 03:42:14.041]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:42:24.625 --> 03:42:37.428]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:42:37.888 --> 03:42:40.069]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:42:40.909 --> 03:42:46.330]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:42:47.398 --> 03:42:55.963]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:42:56.303 --> 03:42:58.165]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:42:58.785 --> 03:43:03.288]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're Infowars.
[03:43:03.988 --> 03:43:09.672]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:43:09.692 --> 03:43:12.573]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:43:13.394 --> 03:43:14.895]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:43:16.124 --> 03:43:32.111]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:32.511 --> 03:43:39.174]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:43:40.245 --> 03:43:40.785]  We're good to go.
[03:43:52.159 --> 03:44:00.263]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:44:00.343 --> 03:44:06.987]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:44:07.127 --> 03:44:09.628]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:44:09.788 --> 03:44:11.709]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:44:11.909 --> 03:44:21.698]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:44:22.318 --> 03:44:24.721]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:24.781 --> 03:44:25.822]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:27.503 --> 03:44:34.209]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:34.329 --> 03:44:40.014]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:44:40.094 --> 03:44:48.641]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:44:48.661 --> 03:44:50.743]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:44:50.763 --> 03:44:50.823]  And
[03:44:52.355 --> 03:45:05.658]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:45:06.139 --> 03:45:10.540]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:15.241]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:45:16.262 --> 03:45:21.485]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:45:21.585 --> 03:45:22.186]  It's amazing.
[03:45:22.326 --> 03:45:23.246]  It's super high quality.
[03:45:23.326 --> 03:45:25.168]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:45:45.481 --> 03:45:45.981]  Thank you.
