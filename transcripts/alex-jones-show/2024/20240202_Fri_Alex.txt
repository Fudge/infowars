[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.016]  The worm is turning, even within the federal government, which is really encouraging for us to see.
[00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:11.702]  I mean, we've had, like you said, we had a well-known federal judge meet with us, U.S.
[00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:29.040]   Marshals meet with us, Department of Homeland Security, a lot of people are upset because I think for the first time, Even the ones who wanted to be kind of concerned about their careers and kind of go along to get along that kind of mentality.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:41.990]  I think this 10 million influx of again of which we previously discussed a high percentage are going to be criminals are going to be terrorists are going to be just bad actors for this country.
[00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:45.093]  I think for the first time it is even shook.
[00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.151]  A significant percentage of the people inside the federal government.
[00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:56.955]  And so it's really now just the very, very top that is still holding on to the ideology.
[00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:04.999]  The Bidens, the Kamala Harrises, you know, those kind of people that are just completely, first of all, out of touch with the American people.
[00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:08.284]  Uh, they still want to hold on to that ideology.
[00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:17.189]  But I think just one or two levels down, I think this invasion has shook Americans across the board to their core.
[00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.312]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.162]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:49.981 --> 00:02:05.340]  It's Friday, February 2nd, 2024.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.901]   And we're about to break one of the biggest stories in the 29 plus year history of this
[00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.181]  operation.
[00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.442]  (upbeat music)
[00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:15.505]  You folks know, we're not about hype.
[00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.647]  When I tell you something's big, it's big.
[00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:20.087]  We deliver.
[00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:21.228]  We are.
[00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:23.688]  Tomorrow's new day.
[00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:26.688]  Ha ha ha!
[00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.688]  The universe is big!
[00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.695]  Globalists want to pose like they're God in the town.
[00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:39.536]   Globalists want to pose like they're God and pretend, but they're not even connected to
[00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:40.536]  God.
[00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:48.735]  276 days, 12 hours, 58 minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.281]  The most important election in world history.
[00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:59.645]  And the corrupt, dying establishment is running around like a chicken with its head cut off that just took five gallons of PCP.
[00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:04.607]  Well, you talk about the Great Awakening.
[00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:09.230]  It's not just in the talk show hosts and all the most popular talk show hosts in the world now are anti-New World Order.
[00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:11.235]  Everybody's joining us.
[00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:13.156]  It's in government.
[00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.357]  It's in corporations.
[00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:15.377]  It's everywhere.
[00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:20.739]  All right, so we've been pinned down because of financial issues, as you know, the last few years.
[00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.140]  We go to the border like two or three times a year.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.063]  And I want to have people at the border full time because the Border Patrol, the National Guard, the State Guard, they're all on our side.
[00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:32.804]  The feds down there that are rank and file are on our side.
[00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:34.065]  I'd say 95% of them.
[00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:37.046]  It is a target-rich environment, to tell the truth.
[00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:47.504]  So, I finally, in the bankruptcy, and moving forward, we're doing better here, got funding to send a couple security guys, a couple reporters, camera people down to the border.
[00:03:48.525 --> 00:04:07.048]   But it's our security people, particularly Tim Inlow, that has, this guy, he never talks about his military service, but the Army, the Marines, Blackwater, Austin police officers, SWAT team, three-letter agencies, federal marshal, you know, air marshals.
[00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:07.769]  He's done it all.
[00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:08.989]  He wants to know everything.
[00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.552]  He trains state police and local police, SWAT team training.
[00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.573]  He's like the guy that they can send in for that.
[00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:17.254]  He's like a really amazing guy.
[00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.735]  He's a good friend of mine, head of security for InfoWars.
[00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:31.056]   Enloe has all these contacts and he went down there and The Border Patrol, all of them, just said, here's everything.
[00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:32.597]  The documents, everything.
[00:04:33.457 --> 00:04:35.999]  And they said, we're really concerned about a false flag right now.
[00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.300]  We think Biden's about to stage a terror attack down here.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.941]  I mean, this is us.
[00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.482]  This is our guys in meetings.
[00:04:42.542 --> 00:04:45.864]  And let me tell you, the meetings I have with NLO is like with high-level federal judges.
[00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:50.446]  I'm not going to say how high level, because it's as high as you can go, other than like the Supreme Court.
[00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:53.288]  You know, we're talking the people.
[00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:55.907]  And so they're like, when are you coming?
[00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:56.568]  When are you coming?
[00:04:56.888 --> 00:04:58.750]  And we need to be down there permanently.
[00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:06.098]  And Drew Hernandez relieves our team with his team on Saturday, and then I'm gonna go, and Owen's gonna go.
[00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:11.203]  Owen, because of his probation from January 6th, can't go until like the 23rd of February.
[00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.846]  But I'm going, we're all going, it's all going down.
[00:05:14.904 --> 00:05:19.346]  And so we're going to break some massive, massive news.
[00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:20.667]  I talk about a Rosetta Stone.
[00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.268]  I talk about a keyhole.
[00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:28.470]  You know, they couldn't decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics until 150 years ago or whatever it was.
[00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.031]  You can look it up.
[00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:30.251]  I think maybe 200 years ago.
[00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:35.014]  They found the Rosetta Stone that was the decoder.
[00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:39.756]  It was like the stone for a classroom for kids, how to read a hieroglyph.
[00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:46.651]  And then once you have the Rosetta Stone, that's what they call that big computer program that teaches you any language, the Rosetta program.
[00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.892]  Once you've got that, you've got it all.
[00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:52.553]  This is ultra-massive news.
[00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:55.914]  How is Biden planning a civil war?
[00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.655]  How is he planning to sic the NSA on the American people?
[00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:01.196]  How are they planning to roll all this out?
[00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:06.618]   We now know from the Feds Who have been briefed on all of it.
[00:06:06.938 --> 00:06:14.102]  Folks, we don't just have whistleblowers in the Border Patrol, or the FBI, or the State Police, or the Guard.
[00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:16.964]  We have them at Fort Meade at the NSA.
[00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:18.305]  Alright?
[00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.386]  Yeah, the NSA.
[00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:27.269]  I mean, I'll be lucky to be alive at the end of this day, but we're about to drop all the data.
[00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.371]  Tomorrow's news today, bitches.
[00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:38.832]  From farmers, to school teachers, to bus drivers, and police officers, and auto mechanics, to FBI agents, and people of the NSA.
[00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:45.233]  America is tired of seeing this country being brought down, and it's going to be whistleblowers that bring down the New World Order.
[00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:47.634]  We have NSA whistleblowers.
[00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.914]  We have Border Patrol whistleblowers.
[00:06:49.954 --> 00:06:51.334]  We have FBI whistleblowers.
[00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:52.775]  We've got it all.
[00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:54.155]  Today.
[00:06:55.103 --> 00:06:56.263]  That's why you kept us on air.
[00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:58.164]  That's why we stayed in attack formation.
[00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:02.886]  Now, here's my earlier report I just put out 15 minutes ago on Exit Reload Alex Jones.
[00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:10.469]  I'll give you all the latest details after this and Tim Inlow, who's been down there on the ground at the border with Chase Geyser.
[00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:14.710]  He doesn't even want to be on air, but this is so technical, he's going to come on air.
[00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.211]  And Tim has worked for most of the federal agencies.
[00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:18.852]  He's done it all.
[00:07:19.332 --> 00:07:20.292]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:21.553]  That's why he has these contacts.
[00:07:21.913 --> 00:07:39.673]  Stay with us.
[00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:41.586]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:44.769]  It's Friday, February 2nd, 2024.
[00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.517]  We have two huge breaking stories right now that are exclusive to InfoWars.
[00:07:52.543 --> 00:08:08.538]  We have a team on the border at Eagle Pass, not just our reporter Chase Geiser, but seasoned former military and law enforcement who've also worked for major three-letter agencies, I'll leave it at that, who have incredible contacts within the U.S.
[00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:13.643]  government, the Border Patrol, the State Guard, you name it.
[00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:20.192]  Yesterday evening, I got a call from Tim Inlow, the head of Infowars Security.
[00:08:21.173 --> 00:08:23.357]  He's one of those people that has extensive background in the government.
[00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.418]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:57.458]   And he has the sources down there known to him, who he met with, and he was shown the Homeland Security FBI memo that came through yesterday morning to the main Border Patrol facility there in Eagle Pass on the Texas-Mexico border, and they told them imminent threat of a white supremacist attack on the illegal alien migrants that were gathering there at Eagle Pass and on the Border Patrol facility.
[00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:28.761]   Now, we then learned Later last night and this morning, the big exclusive to legitimize activating facial recognition software that the NSA has dialed in to the state, federal, and local, as well as many private cameras in South Texas, this terror alert was issued that our sources believe is fake as a pretext
[00:09:29.994 --> 00:09:37.578]  To turn on the NSA software that is illegal to use against U.S.
[00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:43.341]  citizens unless there are special orders given from the President to the NSA at Fort Meade.
[00:09:44.402 --> 00:09:49.845]  And here is the debate going on within the Border Patrol and within Fort Meade.
[00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:52.847]  This information is directly from the NSA.
[00:09:54.768 --> 00:10:10.008]   The NSA is already very, very upset that Their software was used against American citizens on January 6th and the Border Patrol and NSA are concerned about a false flag in Eagle Pass and the fact that this terror alert was issued.
[00:10:10.128 --> 00:10:28.227]   A similar one was done over a year ago when over 10,000 Haitian migrants had stacked up and there was another secret report at the time that white supremacists were going to attack Those individuals and again that was used as a pretext to turn on the facial recognition systems.
[00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:31.149]  There is a major fight going on.
[00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:52.711]   This is the biggest news inside the National Security Agency at Fort Meade in Maryland on the fact that Biden is taking what happened on January 6 and expanding federal offices of the Capitol Police around the country and now Setting the precedent to turn on the facial recognition software all over the country and track citizens in live time.
[00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:56.392]  Now let's be clear, the cameras are on to scan everybody's faces and storing them.
[00:10:56.892 --> 00:11:02.394]  But they're not accessing the faces of American citizens and they're not putting that into the database.
[00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:05.095]  But now, in D.C.
[00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:14.318]  they're doing it on a routine basis and they have given the order at the NSA for this to happen in, not just Eagle Pass, but across the South Texas border.
[00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:24.514]  In response to the, quote, imminent terror attack by white supremacists against the Border Patrol and against, quote, the migrants.
[00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:55.548]   And it is the Border Patrol, and it is the federal law enforcement, and it is the individuals in Fort Meade who interface with the Border Patrol themselves that believe that they are planting some type of false flag down there to, again, expand the January 6th narrative across the country ahead of the election, because Biden has openly said That anybody that opposes his agenda is quote a right-wing extremist and then he's put out that national security memorandum in June of 2021 basically declaring the MAGA movement and basically all conservatives as terrorists so
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:03.626]  This is the apparatus of foreign intelligence being used against the American people and very dangerous presence being set to use it.
[00:12:03.946 --> 00:12:07.449]  But it's good news that there's a major fight going on at the NSA.
[00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:18.158]  And as of just about an hour ago, they are refusing to access the footage and turn it on against the American people.
[00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:26.826]  Obviously, again, as a chilling effect as well, so that people don't want to go out and protest and demonstrate because, quote, you're going to be put in a database.
[00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:30.310]  I totally support the convoys going down there that arrived tonight.
[00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.892]  I think it's great to have citizen journalists drawing attention.
[00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:36.276]  Nobody's going down there to be mean to the illegal aliens or the, quote, migrants.
[00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:40.420]  We're there to draw attention to the fact that we have human smuggling, human trapping of children.
[00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:48.424]  The Democrats are working with the cartels, the Border Patrol, the State Police, the State Guard are all on the same team.
[00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:51.486]  That's another key piece of information from our sources.
[00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:55.788]  And I have direct timelines right here from my sources, our sources.
[00:12:56.963 --> 00:13:12.376]  And at 1130 today, just coming up in less than an hour, at Infowars.com forward slash show and on X at Real Alex Jones, Tim Inlow, who again doesn't normally go on air, but this is so important he is, is going to come on and break down this information and a lot more.
[00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:16.300]  And again, he has seen the documents, he's been allowed to actually verify.
[00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:20.078]  This information, this is a big, big deal.
[00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:24.279]   And the board patrol and other federal agents are seriously concerned that the Biden administration
[00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:28.919]   is attempting to set up the American people and Trump supporters right now.
[00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:32.759]   But we can't just never go cover something or never have a demonstration because of that.
[00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:39.038]   This is a great awakening that our own government and our own military and our own NSA is very
[00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:42.000]   upset about what's going on and is giving us this information.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.120]  So this is extremely historical.
[00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:47.250]  Local news is now reporting on what we broke yesterday.
[00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:53.735]  They're talking to Border Patrol and saying, indeed, there has been this memo of imminent white supremacist attack.
[00:13:54.136 --> 00:13:56.037]  So this is tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:56.398 --> 00:14:00.060]  Again, if you're watching this on X right now, by the time you're watching it, we'll be live.
[00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:12.110]   And you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show or right on the front page of Real Alex Jones on X. And we're going to have Tim Inlow and others on the broadcast giving you real Time information.
[00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:19.136]  This is about not letting the huge apparatus of foreign intelligence be used against the American people.
[00:14:19.216 --> 00:14:21.377]  This is critical to the future of our Republic.
[00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:25.060]  So please share this report and please join us live today at 11 a.m.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.424]  Central at Infowars.com forward slash show and again right here on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.392]  Other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[00:14:35.412 --> 00:14:38.534]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:41.275]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:14:43.677 --> 00:14:44.337]  Exclusive.
[00:14:44.437 --> 00:14:52.403]  Biden administration uses border crisis illegal order NSA to spawn Americans with facial recognition technology based on fake terror alerts issued by the FBI.
[00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:54.704]  You saw Jack Smith a few months ago.
[00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:56.505]  His secret subpoena came out.
[00:14:56.524 --> 00:15:03.164]   got really upset, ordering Twitter X to give them hundreds of millions of people
[00:15:03.164 --> 00:15:07.564]   that had liked or followed or supported President Trump's channel. That's all
[00:15:07.564 --> 00:15:12.404]   about a database in the NSA to link it to your face and create a chilling
[00:15:12.404 --> 00:15:16.083]   effect you're being watched in live time. That's why they're expanding the
[00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:21.965]   Capitol Police all over the country. You say, "Well, we better just shut up and go away."
[00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:20.495]  No, no, no.
[00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:30.963]  This is all being done, again, to take the whole apparatus of national security, supposedly for the Chinese and the Russians and Fang Fang and Swallow's Well, and turn it against us.
[00:15:33.174 --> 00:15:48.385]  But we've got the NSA, the Border Patrol, everybody really upset about that, and they are worried that the criminal elements of the federal government, the same feds that staged the attack on Governor Whitmer and all that that didn't happen, that tried to stage it, they are seriously concerned.
[00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.387]  That doesn't mean you don't go protest.
[00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:52.889]  It doesn't mean you don't go cover things.
[00:15:54.130 --> 00:16:09.142]   But they're using all this to roll out officially during the election year, with only nine and a half, ten months to the election, That anybody that's upset about human trafficking or a totally open border or hundreds of thousands a week coming across, you're a terrorist.
[00:16:10.043 --> 00:16:10.883]  You're a bad guy.
[00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:26.850]   But the good news is, the Border Patrol is totally on our side and they wanted us to know they're working with the state police, they're working with the governor, they're working with the State Guard and they're working, the federal agents who I've talked to, are totally upset.
[00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.230]  They don't want to be involved in human trafficking.
[00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.972]  This is not what they support, just like you don't support it.
[00:16:32.572 --> 00:16:38.734]  And so it's going to be whistleblowers that are king and queen in this whole situation.
[00:16:39.074 --> 00:16:42.956]  And people are not sitting there and taking it lying down.
[00:16:44.577 --> 00:16:45.497]  Think about the takeaway.
[00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:52.632]  I mean, we were shown the documents as well, a year ago, with tens of thousands of Haitians piled up in Eagle Pass.
[00:16:53.453 --> 00:17:02.761]  They put out a fake terror alert, the feds believe it's fake, we talked to, that it was an imminent white supremacist attack, so they could use facial recognition then on the border.
[00:17:03.507 --> 00:17:18.554]  And now Biden's doing it again to set the precedent for the whole United States, just like they used it on January 6th to prosecute all these innocent people, but say we can't release all the footage or all the names because there's so many hundreds of feds in the January 6th crowd.
[00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:23.956]  So they want to use the microcosm of their dud false flag.
[00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.036]  It was supposed to be way worse.
[00:17:25.136 --> 00:17:28.558]  Pelosi was supposed to get kidnapped, all this stuff, but they couldn't provocateur anybody.
[00:17:29.418 --> 00:17:32.920]  So they went ahead and still indicted a bunch of people and put them in prison for decades.
[00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:37.173]  And people that walked in the velvet robes for six months to five years.
[00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:44.437]  And so they want to take this model of January 6th and expand it to everybody.
[00:17:46.238 --> 00:17:54.303]  And the feds, the rank-and-file FBI, NSA, all of them are saying, Border Patrol are saying, we see what you're doing.
[00:17:55.323 --> 00:17:59.465]  And we've talked to a lot of our sources on the border.
[00:17:59.485 --> 00:18:00.226]  This is coming up.
[00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:03.866]  The police know how to spot a leftist.
[00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:05.906]  They're running their license plates.
[00:18:05.946 --> 00:18:07.627]  They're finding out he works for the NGOs.
[00:18:08.147 --> 00:18:12.528]  They've already caught at least a dozen people that are known members of NGOs.
[00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:15.629]  The police just run their plate when they look suspicious.
[00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.870]  And, oh, this guy is on LinkedIn.
[00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.111]  This guy worked for the UN.
[00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:21.651]  This guy works for Biden.
[00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:22.712]  This guy worked for Obama.
[00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:25.913]  And they're all dressed up in Trump outfits with a gun down there.
[00:18:26.733 --> 00:18:28.874]  And the cops just swarm them and start following them.
[00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:30.294]  They're not stupid.
[00:18:30.534 --> 00:18:33.095]  See, once you're aware of a false flag, it loses its power.
[00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:47.899]  So over a dozen, we reported this four days ago, have been identified by law enforcement who are NGO leftists posing as militias down there.
[00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:50.951]  So this isn't our Waterloo.
[00:18:50.991 --> 00:18:52.632]  This isn't us getting our ass kicked.
[00:18:53.172 --> 00:18:54.633]  Now this is our terrain.
[00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:57.635]  This isn't the Capitol where they can rig everything and control it.
[00:18:57.916 --> 00:18:58.936]  And we walk into a trap.
[00:18:59.036 --> 00:18:59.857]  Now we're smarter.
[00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:03.039]  And now we're identifying who they are.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.481]  We're now running their license plates.
[00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:07.782]  We're now going, oh, that's an NGO.
[00:19:07.823 --> 00:19:08.523]  That's an NGO.
[00:19:09.324 --> 00:19:14.147]  Got a bunch of weird chicken neck pedophile looking meth head, you know, people in a restaurant.
[00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:16.609]  The cops aren't dumb.
[00:19:16.629 --> 00:19:22.827]   They look, they go, boy, that doesn't look like Trump supporters, I mean, you know, a group of Trump supporters looks like nice, friendly people.
[00:19:22.847 --> 00:19:25.808]  The men look like, you know, veterans, badasses.
[00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:28.569]  I mean, you just know what a Trump supporter looks like at the Texas border.
[00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:40.994]  The cops see a bunch of people pull up in Priuses and electric cars and they get out in Trump gear with their machine guns and are spouting racist crap at a Mexican food restaurant.
[00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.294]  And the cops are like, we got your ass.
[00:19:43.795 --> 00:19:44.575]  Let's run that plate.
[00:19:46.664 --> 00:19:48.925]  So, we got NGOs down here.
[00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:50.606]  Good luck, dickheads.
[00:19:51.527 --> 00:19:56.590]  Cause see, now we know your operation, and now your operation's blown.
[00:19:58.451 --> 00:20:03.074]  So instead of being afraid to go down there, everybody should go down there and just point cameras everywhere.
[00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:07.116]  Because this isn't one little capital a few square miles they can control.
[00:20:08.777 --> 00:20:09.638]  Or maybe a square mile.
[00:20:12.389 --> 00:20:36.134]  This is Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent and everybody in Dripping Springs last night and all these other people, thousands of trucks going down there to just peacefully sit around and barbecue and talk about America and freedom and point cameras everywhere and get everybody else to not be scared.
[00:20:36.834 --> 00:20:43.889]   I remember on the morning of January 6th, I'm gonna be completely honest with you, But honestly, it's all that matters.
[00:20:45.269 --> 00:20:47.291]  I get up about 6.45, reading news.
[00:20:49.472 --> 00:20:50.212]  It's a big day.
[00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:51.953]  I don't normally drink in the morning.
[00:20:53.594 --> 00:20:58.997]  And I looked at my wife, and I said, baby, let's get a big breakfast and a couple shots of Jack Daniels.
[00:21:00.358 --> 00:21:15.025]   So I ate breakfast by 7.30, hung out with my wife a little bit, went out there, took us an hour and a half to get through the crowd just to where Trump was at, and We had no idea what we were walking into.
[00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:18.086]  We had so many Trump events, so many things were totally peaceful.
[00:21:18.106 --> 00:21:19.847]  We didn't know the feds were gonna stand down and set us up.
[00:21:20.207 --> 00:21:22.608]  We just thought, oh, we got a million people here, we're in charge.
[00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:24.229]  We had that normalcy bias.
[00:21:26.009 --> 00:21:26.890]  And then we got set up.
[00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.811]  Before Trump even finished his speech, they'd already broken into the Capitol.
[00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:35.493]  Before I started running down the road over a mile and a half to get there, they'd already gotten in the damn thing.
[00:21:36.574 --> 00:21:37.234]  But we're not.
[00:21:39.005 --> 00:21:53.241]   That complacent anymore, but I remember about 730 in the morning and my security comes door and they go It's a bunch of former Delta Force guys all these people and they go Jones One of the guys, this guy that captured, you know, Saddam, found the spider hole.
[00:21:53.641 --> 00:21:56.722]  He goes, listen, they got Antifa down there at the Capitol.
[00:21:56.922 --> 00:21:57.762]  This is a setup.
[00:21:58.682 --> 00:21:59.042]  I don't know.
[00:21:59.062 --> 00:22:02.603]  We should, we only had like 10, 15, 15 scriptable.
[00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:04.124]  I said, well, what do we do?
[00:22:04.464 --> 00:22:06.164]  And I said, well, go find out what's going on.
[00:22:06.504 --> 00:22:14.666]  So I'm sitting there and there was so much cell phones being used and so much going on while I'm listening to Trump's and all the other speeches that I can barely get a text like every 10 minutes.
[00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:17.547]  So my phone wasn't working because everybody was using all the data.
[00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:25.378]  But once I got out of there and all the text came through, my crew's like, hey, we're down here at the Capitol.
[00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:26.178]  Looks like a setup.
[00:22:26.198 --> 00:22:26.978]  You need to get down here.
[00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:28.239]  Looks like they're going to do something.
[00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:29.039]  Get down here and stop it.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.581]  So as soon as I get out on Pennsylvania Avenue and run that way, it was already too late.
[00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:37.582]  We're not behind the eight ball now.
[00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:41.004]  We're watching everything they do.
[00:22:43.344 --> 00:22:45.425]  So if I was ever on a march on D.C.
[00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:48.646]  again, I sure as hell won't be eating omelets and drinking Jack Daniels.
[00:22:49.147 --> 00:22:50.047]  I apologize for that.
[00:22:51.698 --> 00:22:52.899]  I only had like one shot or something.
[00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:58.144]  The point is, is that I'm just having fun with my wife, enjoying myself, and just thinking, oh, the government will handle it.
[00:22:58.184 --> 00:23:05.091]  You know, I'm going to go out and watch Trump's speech, and they claim I'm going to do some, you know, rally with him at another stage they had.
[00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:09.976]  They had the permit by the Supreme Court building right there on the corner of the Capitol.
[00:23:11.617 --> 00:23:12.758]  But we walked right into that.
[00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:19.906]   But just because we walked right into that, Doesn't mean we've got to do it over and over and over again.
[00:23:20.226 --> 00:23:30.672]  And that doesn't mean we don't then go to the border and show the illegal aliens and show the open border and show the human trafficking and show the NGOs.
[00:23:31.032 --> 00:23:32.513]  They want to intimidate you.
[00:23:32.573 --> 00:23:33.874]  No, this is our victory.
[00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:37.596]  We go down there and the Border Patrol and all of them are on our side.
[00:23:39.337 --> 00:23:43.040]  So it's a beautiful moment to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.971]   But it's also a real opportunity and also a great danger because Here's the big takeaway.
[00:23:51.215 --> 00:23:54.340]  Biden has put out a terror alert that we've seen.
[00:23:55.595 --> 00:24:02.978]  Two days ago saying imminent terror attack on the Border Patrol and on the illegal aliens at those migrant centers.
[00:24:03.259 --> 00:24:08.221]  So they secretly shipped them all out the last few days or day and a half on buses somewhere else.
[00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:11.602]  But the Border Patrol, everybody else is like, this is crap.
[00:24:12.163 --> 00:24:13.383]  No one's even here yet.
[00:24:13.783 --> 00:24:14.504]  They all know.
[00:24:14.584 --> 00:24:18.546]  Maybe they got some meth-head white supremacist who actually believes in Patriot Front, who knows.
[00:24:19.446 --> 00:24:21.887]  But it's not real, folks.
[00:24:22.147 --> 00:24:23.708]  We know that intuitively.
[00:24:24.744 --> 00:24:26.165]  And the Border Patrol isn't buying it.
[00:24:26.726 --> 00:24:28.107]  And the federal agents aren't buying it.
[00:24:28.648 --> 00:24:30.009]  And the NSA's not buying it.
[00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:31.110]  There's a major fight.
[00:24:32.312 --> 00:24:33.092]  And they refused.
[00:24:34.294 --> 00:24:43.383]  Biden ordered them a day and a half ago to use all the face scanning technology that's hooked into all the cameras.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.522]  To turn it on for the American people, not just cameras out there for known terrorists that are already in the database.
[00:24:49.842 --> 00:24:52.422]  So they're already running everybody's picture, but no one's allowed to look at it.
[00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:54.303]  It's a computer doing it.
[00:24:54.363 --> 00:24:54.903]  It's AI.
[00:24:56.224 --> 00:25:02.745]  And so, okay, Habib, whatever, or Hezbollah, Hamas guy pops up, convicted murderer, whatever, that pops up.
[00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:07.167]  They want to turn it on to grab everybody.
[00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:17.721]  That comes there and run it through a database and then say if you're there protesting, you're in a database as a terrorist as an intimidation tactic down the road.
[00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:19.962]  But they didn't want it known they're doing this.
[00:25:20.002 --> 00:25:22.964]  This is a scandal beyond the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:26.445]  It's a scandal beyond internet censorship and big tech control.
[00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:27.846]  Do you hear me?
[00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.567]  This is a Rosetta Stone.
[00:25:29.587 --> 00:25:31.187]  This is a keyhole in their operation.
[00:25:31.507 --> 00:25:34.669]  This is Biden issuing fake terror alerts.
[00:25:37.734 --> 00:25:39.596]  That they did a year ago as well, we now learn.
[00:25:40.176 --> 00:25:43.158]  Telling the Border Patrol, right-wingers are coming to kill you.
[00:25:43.198 --> 00:25:46.881]  And the Feds are just like, the rank-and-file are just like, oh my God.
[00:25:48.062 --> 00:25:52.866]  We've already seen this rodeo before with the Haitians, and this is a load of crap.
[00:25:53.306 --> 00:26:00.992]  And then the NSA that the Border Patrol is heavily interfaced with says, we're refusing right now to turn this on.
[00:26:01.213 --> 00:26:02.453]  Plus, imagine the work.
[00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.151]  Now they don't just want the camera scanning all the faces coming across the border.
[00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:14.772]  Now all these cameras everywhere are grabbing everybody's face and putting them in databases.
[00:26:14.913 --> 00:26:18.753]  It's the government waging war against the American people.
[00:26:18.773 --> 00:26:21.954]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:26.955]  Come back with Tim Enlope, head of InfoWare Security, and all of his breaking news.
[00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:30.396]  He's getting even more information, I'm told, since I talked to him about an hour and a half ago.
[00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:33.234]  I'm going to talk about this right now.
[00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:36.058]  InfoWars, this isn't hype.
[00:26:36.098 --> 00:26:36.699]  This is real.
[00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:37.240]  We've done it.
[00:26:38.524 --> 00:26:42.205]  I'm not trying to brag, but it's like where Lance Armstrong went in the Tour de France like six, seven times.
[00:26:42.805 --> 00:26:43.805]  It's because of your support.
[00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:47.166]  You're not betting on a horse when you support us that has failed.
[00:26:47.866 --> 00:26:50.187]  In fact, if you don't bet on us now, you're insane.
[00:26:50.207 --> 00:27:01.890]  Because the globalists see us as a major enemy to take down because thanks to your support and our crew and our guests and what we've done and God literally inspiring us, we've changed the world.
[00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:06.284]  So none of the credit goes to me, but we are doing very important work.
[00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:09.007]  So I need all of you listening to make a decision.
[00:27:09.047 --> 00:27:09.687]  It's up to you.
[00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:12.550]  Just say, I'm going to go to Infowarsstore.com.

[00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:31.773]  If more people would share the articles and the videos, what you're doing, I'm seeing a lot of you aren't.
[00:27:32.393 --> 00:27:34.915]  We would change the world at an even greater clip.
[00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:38.318]  So, Nitric Boost was our sleeper product.

[00:28:01.937 --> 00:28:02.777]  And we even got a better deal.
[00:28:03.358 --> 00:28:08.000]  So instead of offering 25% off on Nitric Boost, we never went past that because the product was so expensive.

[00:28:39.929 --> 00:28:41.851]  What is in the spinach that Popeye eats?
[00:28:42.311 --> 00:28:45.734]  I'm strong to the finish because I eat my spinach and Popeye the Sailor, man, doot-doot!
[00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:50.979]  That's folic acid, but most people, particularly white people, don't absorb a lot of folic acid.
[00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:52.180]  This is the breakdown of it.

[00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:12.878]  We're fighting together.

[00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:21.646]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:29.012]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:29:29.212 --> 00:29:31.234]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:29:31.394 --> 00:29:32.475]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:29:32.495 --> 00:29:33.236]  He loved the idea.
[00:29:33.536 --> 00:29:37.059]  What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:37.960]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.901]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:39.482]  Absolutely.
[00:29:39.822 --> 00:29:41.203]  And so, we have the t-shirt.
[00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:44.687]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[00:29:44.947 --> 00:29:52.394]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air, so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:29:52.654 --> 00:30:04.357]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:30:04.657 --> 00:30:05.978]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:06.998]  We're told we're killing Earth.
[00:30:07.258 --> 00:30:11.539]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:12.540]  We're not going to do that.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.441]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullworldstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[00:30:18.021 --> 00:30:19.164]  Global exclusive!
[00:30:19.225 --> 00:30:26.824]  Biden administration using secret fake terror alerts to target conservative Americans with NSA technology illegally warns whistleblowers.
[00:30:28.024 --> 00:30:32.625]  And Tim Inlow, head of Enforced Security down there with a crew, has all these sources.
[00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:33.426]  He's done a great job.
[00:30:33.466 --> 00:30:34.366]  He's seen the documents.
[00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:35.886]  This is going on.
[00:30:35.926 --> 00:30:40.488]  But this is how Biden wants to roll out January 6th against the American people.
[00:30:40.508 --> 00:30:42.228]  They're planning something big down there.
[00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:46.850]  The answer is more people, more cameras, spotlighting what's going on.
[00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:53.072]  Issuing terror alerts to then turn NSA facial recognition on against the American people.
[00:30:53.492 --> 00:30:56.833]  Taking what they did on January 6th at the Capitol and expanding it.
[00:30:57.651 --> 00:31:00.034]  And so Tim Inlow joins us to talk about this.
[00:31:00.074 --> 00:31:04.339]  This is a huge deal and the whole January 6th thing has gone up in flames.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.401]  They've now taken off the docket.
[00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:10.646]  The trial against Trump, that's quietly getting backburnered and shut down.
[00:31:11.067 --> 00:31:13.429]  The Jan 6th committee destroyed their videos.
[00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.093]  Interviewing me and all the transcripts because it showed it was a federal operation.
[00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:21.456]  This is their attempt to frame the American people as terrorists.
[00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:23.398]  That's why it's so important.
[00:31:23.418 --> 00:31:24.599]  We've got to go to the border.
[00:31:24.859 --> 00:31:25.780]  We've got to cover it.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.045]  And then the fact that the Border Patrol and the Feds and the NSA are literally telling us, hey, we're saying no to this.
[00:31:32.425 --> 00:31:33.747]  We're worried about a false flag.
[00:31:33.827 --> 00:31:34.887]  It's such a huge deal.
[00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:36.889]  So, Tim, you've interfaced with these folks.
[00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:38.150]  You're breaking this information.
[00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:40.372]  This is so incredible.
[00:31:40.792 --> 00:31:41.673]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:31:41.713 --> 00:31:42.434]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:31:44.146 --> 00:31:45.768]  Thanks Alex, good to be on.
[00:31:46.188 --> 00:31:53.533]  So, we've been here in Eagle Pass, Texas since Tuesday, covering the situation down here and what's going on on the border.
[00:31:54.554 --> 00:32:02.180]  It's really incredible and during that time we've developed some incredible sources that work for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:09.106]  And one source in particular has been spot on about all the information that they've given us.
[00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:12.470]  We'll call him Elias is the source.
[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.232]  Well, that's the name we'll use for the source is Elias.
[00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:19.436]  And so it kind of all started really rolling fast yesterday.
[00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:21.338]  So around 3.48 p.m.
[00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:41.729]   yesterday afternoon on February 1st, Uh, I got a call from my source, Elias, basically saying, hey, uh, don't know what's going on, but suddenly they're evacuating the main Border Patrol processing, migrant processing center that's located on Firefly Lane, uh, here in Eagle Pass.
[00:32:42.626 --> 00:32:59.615]  And he told me that they were moving all the migrants out of that facility, including unaccompanied minors as well as adult migrants, and that they were putting them on buses and shipping them out to more secure Border Patrol stations around Eagle Pass.
[00:32:59.635 --> 00:33:07.999]  So, to confirm this information, we immediately proceeded to the South Border Patrol station here in Eagle Pass, and around 4.41 p.m.
[00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:13.110]   yesterday afternoon, Tim, you immediately proceeded to the Eagle Pass Border Patrol Station.
[00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.151]  That's when you cut out.
[00:33:14.191 --> 00:33:14.491]  Go ahead.
[00:33:15.312 --> 00:33:15.733]  That's correct.
[00:33:16.531 --> 00:33:16.911]  Yes, sir.
[00:33:17.212 --> 00:33:21.374]  We proceeded to the South Border Patrol Station.
[00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:27.238]  We saw five large buses coming in, which basically confirmed our source's information.
[00:33:27.998 --> 00:33:33.681]  Those buses were filled to the brim with migrants, and they took them into that South Station.
[00:33:34.802 --> 00:33:37.364]  Then, around 5.30 p.m.
[00:33:37.504 --> 00:34:08.536]   yesterday evening, I met in person With this source, with Elias, who showed me the FBI memo that had been sent to all the Border Patrol stations, basically saying that the FBI had identified two white supremacists who were planning an attack on the Border Patrol Processing Center on Firefly Lane sometime between today, Friday, February 2nd, and Monday, February 5th.
[00:34:09.386 --> 00:34:16.654]  And out of an abundance of caution, the Border Patrol decided to immediately move those migrants to more secure facilities.
[00:34:16.995 --> 00:34:17.735]  That was at 5.30 p.m.
[00:34:17.756 --> 00:34:18.697]  yesterday evening.
[00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.394]  At 740 a.m.
[00:34:24.434 --> 00:34:52.532]   this morning, I get a call from an additional source who then informed me that there are heated, and this was a quote, heated discussions going on at Fort Meade, Virginia, obviously where the NSA is located, about using facial recognition against The convoy of people that are coming here, American citizens that are coming here to the border to bring attention to our wide-open southern border.
[00:34:53.252 --> 00:35:00.556]  And it was described to me as a similar dragnet that was used on January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:12.601]  And that there was a lot of pushback from certain sections at Fort Meade who felt that this was illegal and that it was not proper to employ this against the American people.
[00:35:16.078 --> 00:35:18.660]  I mean, this is just sensational information.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.302]  And then we learned a year ago they did it with the Haitians as well.
[00:35:21.342 --> 00:35:24.284]  So obviously, I know you talked to your sources, they concurred.
[00:35:24.564 --> 00:35:33.150]  This is an attempt to roll out the entire international defense system against the American people, which Biden has said the main enemy is the American people.
[00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.513]  It's great to see this pushback from federal intelligence and law enforcement.
[00:35:38.582 --> 00:35:38.782]  Right.
[00:35:39.302 --> 00:35:40.483]  And that's one thing I can tell you.
[00:35:40.523 --> 00:35:54.787]  Since we've been here on Tuesday, the agents on the ground here, whether it's Border Patrol, the National Guard units that are here, all of them are 100%, the ones we've talked to, are 100% on the side of the American people.
[00:35:55.087 --> 00:35:55.327]  Right?
[00:35:56.268 --> 00:35:57.648]  They don't like what's going on.
[00:35:58.248 --> 00:35:59.369]  They want to make a difference.
[00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:01.069]  They want to stop this invasion.
[00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:05.971]  But they are somewhat hamstrung, obviously, by their leadership.
[00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.352]  And by the orders that are coming out of Washington.
[00:36:08.392 --> 00:36:11.674]  Yeah, they're not in charge of the money or the policy, so they're stuck in a rockin' hard place.
[00:36:12.554 --> 00:36:13.535]  That's exactly right.
[00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:26.302]  But the ones that are actually boots on ground here have been nothing but cooperative with us, have been willing to share a lot of inside information with us, because they want the word to get out on what's going on down here on this southern border, right?
[00:36:26.602 --> 00:36:36.413]   With the terrorists coming across, child rapists coming across, murderers coming across, and people Watch the show.
[00:36:38.576 --> 00:36:41.100]  You can literally call the government.
[00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:42.902]  Hold on, Tim.
[00:36:43.122 --> 00:36:43.783]  Tim, stay there.
[00:36:44.484 --> 00:36:46.407]  Tim, hold on a minute.
[00:36:46.427 --> 00:36:46.867]  Start over.
[00:36:47.168 --> 00:36:49.291]  You were getting into the rapists coming across the border.
[00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:51.954]  Your Skype broke up again, but it's going to reconnect.
[00:36:52.074 --> 00:36:52.755]  Okay, it's back.
[00:36:52.795 --> 00:36:53.076]  Go ahead.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.361]  Yeah, my apologies to Wi-Fi out here.
[00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.181]  That's not your fault.
[00:36:58.221 --> 00:36:58.561]  We get it.
[00:36:58.621 --> 00:36:59.641]  Hey, it's great technology.
[00:36:59.661 --> 00:37:00.282]  We're lucky to have you.
[00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:00.542]  Go ahead.
[00:37:00.562 --> 00:37:00.922]  Keep going.
[00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:02.342]  Right.
[00:37:02.482 --> 00:37:13.647]  So again, you know, viewers can pull up these documents, right, that show just how many child rapists have been contacted by Border Patrol, how many murderers have been stopped by Border Patrol.
[00:37:14.187 --> 00:37:20.309]  I mean, but the problem is those are the ones that either surrendered or were caught by Border Patrol.
[00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:20.849]  Right?
[00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:25.911]  So when we look at those numbers, which are in the thousands, thousands, right?
[00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:36.615]  Then you've got to think about the gotaways, what the Border Patrol calls gotaways, which are the ones who didn't want to be caught and who definitely wanted to get into the country without contact by law enforcement.
[00:37:36.936 --> 00:37:40.857]  And those number in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
[00:37:41.137 --> 00:37:52.735]   And if we just look at the percentages of criminals that the Border Patrol has caught, then you have to assume percentages apply to gotaways as well if not more because
[00:37:52.735 --> 00:37:57.636]   those Are determined not to be caught have a bigger reason for
[00:37:57.636 --> 00:38:02.085]   all right Tim stay there again You're having some there's a lot of people down there now.
[00:38:02.085 --> 00:38:04.616]   There's not a lot of cell phone reception here on the border
[00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:11.566]   We probably maybe do this the hotel next time but but it Look you've been there with me with the with the high-level
[00:38:11.566 --> 00:38:15.736]   federal judges and the federal agents Who are really concerned about this and how they're told
[00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:22.086]   that we are ordered Under law to release known criminals all we can do is keep
[00:38:22.086 --> 00:38:27.456]   them for a few weeks under under statutes of misdemeanors for being an illegal crosser
[00:38:27.678 --> 00:38:31.359]  So I'm not trying to lionize the feds, but we're in meetings with high-level feds.
[00:38:31.379 --> 00:38:32.819]  We're not just saying that here on air.
[00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:34.679]  So this is crazy.
[00:38:34.999 --> 00:38:43.906]   The top is doing all this crime with Mayorkas, but whether it's high-level federal judges or FBI agents or federal marshals, We're Border Patrol.
[00:38:44.426 --> 00:38:46.767]  They are all super upset and don't know what to do.
[00:38:46.887 --> 00:38:47.727]  We don't know what to do.
[00:38:47.927 --> 00:38:50.108]  And again, they only got so many cell towers down there.
[00:38:50.648 --> 00:38:52.309]  And now the caravan's getting there.
[00:38:52.669 --> 00:38:53.769]  The convoy's getting there.
[00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:54.669]  There's people everywhere.
[00:38:55.189 --> 00:38:57.710]  And so I wanted them to be on the border for this.
[00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.971]  I almost said do it at the hotel, but I wanted them to be at the border.
[00:39:01.611 --> 00:39:02.571]  And so people could see this.
[00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:04.072]  So that's my decision to do that.
[00:39:04.532 --> 00:39:06.312]  My earlier decision was just stay at the hotel.
[00:39:06.372 --> 00:39:06.993]  You got better internet.
[00:39:07.013 --> 00:39:09.713]  But people need to know we're at the damn Texas border.
[00:39:10.254 --> 00:39:11.514]  And this is all going down.
[00:39:12.779 --> 00:39:15.200]  This is all happening, folks, and this is just totally insane.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:21.541]  And, I mean, I'm in meetings with, I mean, like, I won't even say who, because it gives it away, it's already known.
[00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:26.202]  The head judges, the head FBI people, they're like, what do we do?
[00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:28.622]  I don't, I mean, I'm like them, like, what do we do?
[00:39:29.062 --> 00:39:32.743]  I mean, this is mass criminal activity taking place.
[00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:37.004]  This is human trafficking, kidnapped children.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:44.305]  This is, this is so unbelievable that you're like, we're all asking each other, what do we do?
[00:39:44.745 --> 00:39:46.407]  Because we're not administrative control.
[00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:52.211]  We don't, we're trying to pay our bills and, you know, put gas in the car and, you know, keep the lights on.
[00:39:52.231 --> 00:40:05.302]  And we're sitting here watching this mass criminal activity and illegal aliens beating up police in New York City and a day later, released out of jail, telling the media, F you, and laughing.
[00:40:05.942 --> 00:40:08.484]  I mean, George Soros runs this country.
[00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:09.985]  I don't say that to empower him.
[00:40:10.505 --> 00:40:13.347]  Let's admit where we are.
[00:40:14.207 --> 00:40:17.189]  Let's admit how much we're getting our ass kicked.
[00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:22.732]  Because in my life, I didn't start the fights, I finished them, and I won almost all of them.
[00:40:22.752 --> 00:40:23.373]  I lost a few.
[00:40:24.278 --> 00:40:30.324]  But when I finally realized I'm getting my ass handed to me, I'm gonna open a can of a whoop-ass, that's when I'd win.
[00:40:31.185 --> 00:40:32.567]  And that's where we are politically.
[00:40:33.007 --> 00:40:37.072]  If they can't reconnect via Skype or Zoom, do it over the phone, okay?
[00:40:37.692 --> 00:40:37.953]  Boom.
[00:40:38.033 --> 00:40:39.154]  Calls phone, get him on right now.
[00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:43.518]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:44.292 --> 00:40:45.773]  We'll get Chase Geiser on as well.
[00:40:46.553 --> 00:40:52.555]  But this is such, such a massive, massive, massive development.
[00:40:52.915 --> 00:40:53.996]  We basically already got it out.
[00:40:54.676 --> 00:40:56.137]  But you just heard that.
[00:40:56.197 --> 00:41:05.080]  I mean, let me tell you, we're not up here like, oh, we met with federal judges, oh, we met with the FBI, oh, we met with the state police, we met with the, no, no, we met with the Border Patrol.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.441]  We have seen the documents.
[00:41:09.242 --> 00:41:12.043]  We have released the information.
[00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:30.328]  So they're planning something big down there, but the good news is we've got so many cameras and so many people and the Border Patrol and the State Police and the National Guard and the State Guard and everybody is so dialed in, they're like, we're worried about a false flag right now.
[00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:34.192]  Oh yeah, white supremacists are going to attack the Border Patrol.
[00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.975]  White supremacists are about to kill the illegal aliens.
[00:41:37.813 --> 00:41:40.376]  And the Feds are the ones saying, we're trying to stop a false flag, what do we do?
[00:41:40.757 --> 00:41:43.940]  I'm like, you know as much as I do or more, what do we do?
[00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:52.530]  We expose it, and all of you watching, take the links, take the information, and you get it out to everybody you know.
[00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:57.376]  That's how we beat this, and that's why we're still on air right now today.
[00:41:58.237 --> 00:41:58.718]  Doing this.
[00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:00.560]  I'm gonna find out what's going on.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.224]  I'm gonna play a clip and come right back here.
[00:42:04.025 --> 00:42:07.609]  We got some new really powerful special reports that have got to be seen.
[00:42:08.591 --> 00:42:09.392]  So I want to play.
[00:42:10.595 --> 00:42:11.335]  Democide.
[00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:18.159]  Democrat congressmen and state reps and others, just like Swallow's Well and Biden, are calling for the U.S.
[00:42:18.179 --> 00:42:22.022]  military to bomb anybody that goes to the border to expose what's happening.
[00:42:22.362 --> 00:42:29.966]  That's how disconnected and unaware of military affairs, if the feds bomb the border and us, that wouldn't be good for us.
[00:42:30.026 --> 00:42:30.787]  It's like the Alamo.
[00:42:30.847 --> 00:42:31.968]  That's bad for them.
[00:42:32.408 --> 00:42:33.368]  But they don't even know.
[00:42:33.388 --> 00:42:35.150]  They say nuke Republican cities.
[00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:36.951]  Democrats control all the cities.
[00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:37.451]  All of them.
[00:42:39.318 --> 00:42:42.200]  They don't even understand military technology, military history.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:49.003]  So they're out saying, let's nuke the Republicans when the cities are 60% Democrat.
[00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:51.285]  But that's where they are.
[00:42:51.144 --> 00:43:04.025]  Here's the report.
[00:43:03.996 --> 00:43:05.056]  It's written in Chinese.
[00:43:05.276 --> 00:43:07.578]  If you go on the back though, this is what really gets me.
[00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:11.100]  It actually has the organization that created this document.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.642]  Directly from Ultralato and the American Bar Association.
[00:43:14.942 --> 00:43:16.703]  These guys are directly aiding and abetting.
[00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:28.589]  Tensions are high as a wide-open border floods Texas cities with military-aged males, criminals, and potential terrorists that has citizens on edge.
[00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:36.213]  Courtney Hacking keeps a shrine in her Nevada home to her husband Peter, her four-year-old daughter Ellie, and her two-year-old son Grayson.
[00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:39.174]  Their car was struck head-on, killing all three.
[00:43:39.194 --> 00:43:44.697]  He was here illegally, he drove illegally, he was working illegally, and he killed three innocent people.
[00:43:45.217 --> 00:43:53.300]  Francisco Oropesa, 38-year-old Mexican national who has allegedly killed five of his former Texas neighbors.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:58.442]  He apparently was out shooting a weapon, being very loud and belligerent, apparently drinking.
[00:43:58.502 --> 00:44:02.384]  The neighbors went outside and asked him to stop shooting that weapon.
[00:44:02.664 --> 00:44:08.106]  He then, in turn, took his AR-15 and allegedly slaughtered a family of five, including a nine-year-old boy.
[00:44:09.987 --> 00:44:16.272]  20-year-old daughter Kayla Hamilton was murdered in her own room and left on the floor like trash.
[00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:21.917]  Kayla's murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the U.S.
[00:44:22.037 --> 00:44:24.960]  at the southwest border in Rio Grande City, Texas.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:30.104]  He was a 16-year-old known gang member affiliated with MS-13 in El Salvador.
[00:44:30.624 --> 00:44:39.348]  As the Biden administration demands, the United Nations NGO Soros engineered invasion continue at all costs.
[00:44:39.368 --> 00:44:49.012]  500 million in investment, he says, to invest in startups, established companies, social impact initiatives, and businesses started by migrants and refugees.
[00:44:49.052 --> 00:44:53.294]  What about all the people in this country that could really use that help themselves to get a leg up?
[00:44:53.193 --> 00:44:55.193]  You know, charity begins at home.
[00:44:55.193 --> 00:45:00.193]   Have you done everything you can do with executive authority?
[00:45:00.193 --> 00:45:02.193]  Is there more you can do?
[00:45:02.193 --> 00:45:04.193]  Absolutely not. All I can do...
[00:45:04.193 --> 00:45:06.193]  He immediately halted construction of the border wall.
[00:45:07.012 --> 00:45:10.454]  He reinstated the disastrous policy of catch and release.
[00:45:11.174 --> 00:45:14.876]  And he ended the incredibly successful Remain in Mexico agreement.
[00:45:14.896 --> 00:45:17.657]  And that took the lowest rate of illegal immigration.
[00:45:18.337 --> 00:45:20.138]  And it caused it to explode.
[00:45:20.479 --> 00:45:23.121]  We now have the highest rate in history.
[00:45:23.141 --> 00:45:27.063]  9.6 million illegal immigrants have come into this country.
[00:45:27.384 --> 00:45:28.845]  And Joe Biden wants it.
[00:45:29.245 --> 00:45:30.046]  It's deliberate.
[00:45:30.106 --> 00:45:31.427]  He could fix it tomorrow.
[00:45:31.447 --> 00:45:33.148]  Okay, we've had a problem.
[00:45:33.628 --> 00:46:01.670]   Responding to a tweet spotlighting the heavily armed states backing Texas in its standoff with the Biden administration, rather than at the very least calm the fears of his constituents, Texas Democrat State Representative Gene Wu suggested the proper response to those backing Texas would be for the US military to drop bombs on these Americans with drone-fired hellfire missiles.
[00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:10.973]  The audacity of the statement of naked psychopathic democide was met with, as expected, enraged tweets.
[00:46:11.433 --> 00:46:19.255]  However, Wu continued to double down on his stance that the American people that he represents are the enemy.
[00:46:19.575 --> 00:46:30.339]   Never ever In my three-plus decades ever heard anyone accuse parents of murdered children of being partisan one way or the other.
[00:46:30.619 --> 00:46:40.822]  State Representative Gene Wu has been accusing Crimestoppers of being partisan for calling out judges who grant multiple felony bonds to repeat violent offenders.
[00:46:41.302 --> 00:46:44.823]  In a tweet, Khan invited Wu to a POMC meeting.
[00:46:44.943 --> 00:46:48.906]  Mr. Wood declines that I don't go to Republican organization events.
[00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:56.050]  And when I woke up on Saturday and I saw that, that hurt me because this is not a partisan group.
[00:46:56.231 --> 00:47:06.497]   For the life of me, I cannot figure out why a state representative would come to the ill-advised conclusion That PLMC meetings at Crimestoppers are partisan.
[00:47:06.797 --> 00:47:08.958]  That's about as far-fetched as you can get.
[00:47:09.078 --> 00:47:26.907]  The madness to destroy the United States from within is completely off the rails in 2024, as disturbing video from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport shows a group of migrants tucked away in a hidden room guarded by a U.S.
[00:47:26.987 --> 00:47:27.747]  service member.
[00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:35.389]  Yeah, so these are just recently documented travelers getting released from ICE, getting to where they need to be.
[00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:37.190]  Apparently, the U.S.
[00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:42.391]  military is aiding and abetting the collapse of the United States.
[00:47:42.771 --> 00:47:47.493]  I love my right-wing friends who talk about the tree of liberty is water of the blood of patriots.
[00:47:47.813 --> 00:47:50.193]  You need to work about taking on the federal government.
[00:47:50.213 --> 00:47:51.214]  You need some F-15s.
[00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:55.615]  America is in free fall, and no one is manning the controls.
[00:47:56.155 --> 00:48:00.380]  The point of no return may already be long behind us.
[00:48:00.539 --> 00:48:02.539]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:48:02.539 --> 00:48:09.539]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening now.
[00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:14.750]   Alright, our crew had their internet cut. They're going to move to another location and join us coming up the start of
[00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.539]  the next hour.
[00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:23.719]   The former Defense Intelligence Agency Green Beret and lawyer, Ivan Reikland, is going to join us in studio to
[00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:26.539]   talk about all the things that are happening in the world and more.
[00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:29.940]  We're going to get a pop-in on the economy at the bottom of the next hour by Kirk Elliott.
[00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:37.923]  And we're also going to have Jay Dyer joining us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:48:38.383 --> 00:48:44.305]  But again, everybody in media, almost everybody, follows somebody else's story.
[00:48:45.672 --> 00:48:54.475]  We are breaking that they are saying that white supremacists are going to attack the Border Patrol and the illegal aliens down there that they call migrants.
[00:48:54.995 --> 00:49:00.577]  With no evidence, as a pretext to have the NSA turn on its systems against the American people.
[00:49:01.017 --> 00:49:01.837]  This is a big deal.
[00:49:02.777 --> 00:49:05.198]  And I don't even care about the credit.
[00:49:05.998 --> 00:49:11.520]  But we need the Glenn Greenwalds, the Tucker Carlsons, to force this out.
[00:49:12.639 --> 00:49:21.088]  Just like we told you in August, we were planning new rollouts of COVID, which they then did, but we stopped most of it because people listened to me.
[00:49:22.249 --> 00:49:32.639]  So we're right back here, folks, with real people, with real connections on the border, with Homeland Security, trying to stage something down there to have J6 2.0.
[00:49:34.369 --> 00:49:35.509]  You're like, well, we better not go down there.
[00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:37.630]  No, no, you go down there to expose it.
[00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.171]  Imagine we said, we're not going down there, we'll get set up.
[00:49:40.491 --> 00:49:44.132]  It's not one capital, one event where they can set us up, it's a huge border.
[00:49:44.772 --> 00:49:50.213]  They fear us, they're exposing the entire operation.
[00:49:51.693 --> 00:49:57.155]  So this is a big, big, big, big, big, big deal.
[00:49:58.455 --> 00:50:01.056]  And we cannot do this without you.
[00:50:01.892 --> 00:50:02.532]  And that's why.
[00:50:03.053 --> 00:50:06.134]  You go down there and you'll see them smuggling drugs right across in front of you.
[00:50:06.714 --> 00:50:10.256]  You'll see all sorts of just insane stuff all around you.
[00:50:10.276 --> 00:50:13.677]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:50:15.458 --> 00:50:17.179]  It is ridiculous.
[00:50:17.939 --> 00:50:29.144]  But what did Thomas Jefferson, you gotta ask, famously, walking out of the legislature during the war, a woman asked him, what is the limit that tyrants will go to?
[00:50:29.164 --> 00:50:31.045]  And he said, the limit good men and women allow.
[00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:35.976]  Alright, they got moved to another location.
[00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:39.084]  We're going to break here in just a few minutes, but Tim...
[00:50:40.356 --> 00:50:49.462]  This is very encouraging that we've got such great intel from the Border Patrol and the NSA and the Feds.
[00:50:49.923 --> 00:50:53.125]  I was asking about the Feds we've met with, the judges, without getting their names.
[00:50:53.525 --> 00:51:01.991]  I'm not trying to lionize the Feds, but having top-level federal judges meet with us and people, I mean, this shows they're really upset.
[00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:04.513]  The whole government's not the problem, it's who's running at the top.
[00:51:04.993 --> 00:51:05.553]  That's my view.
[00:51:05.593 --> 00:51:05.994]  What's your view?
[00:51:07.046 --> 00:51:07.646]  I agree with that 100%.
[00:51:07.686 --> 00:51:14.590]  The worm is turning, even within the federal government, which is really encouraging for us to see.
[00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:20.273]  I mean, we've had, like you said, we had a well-known federal judge meet with us, U.S.
[00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:37.624]   Marshals meet with us, Department of Homeland Security, a lot of people are upset because I think for the first time, Even the ones who wanted to be kind of concerned about their careers and kind of go along to get along that kind of mentality.
[00:51:37.644 --> 00:51:50.594]  I think this 10 million influx of again of which we previously discussed a high percentage are going to be criminals are going to be terrorists are going to be just bad actors for this country.
[00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:53.657]  I think for the first time it is even shook.
[00:51:54.312 --> 00:51:58.734]  A significant percentage of the people inside the federal government.
[00:51:59.174 --> 00:52:05.537]  And so it's really now just a very, very top that is still holding on to the ideology.
[00:52:05.597 --> 00:52:13.580]  The Bidens, the Kamala Harrises, you know, those kind of people that are just completely, first of all, out of touch with the American people.
[00:52:14.806 --> 00:52:16.867]  They still want to hold on to that ideology.
[00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:25.772]  But I think just one or two levels down, I think this invasion has shook Americans across the board to their core.
[00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:28.253]  Perfectly said, Tim.
[00:52:28.273 --> 00:52:29.474]  We'll come back and talk a few more minutes.
[00:52:29.494 --> 00:52:31.635]  You guys will get back on your main mission.
[00:52:32.847 --> 00:52:34.088]  That's how evil always works.
[00:52:34.128 --> 00:52:37.672]  It looks like it's winning till it gets so ridiculous good people finally wake up.
[00:52:38.012 --> 00:52:40.875]  And I mean, it is just... You've been there many times with me.
[00:52:41.075 --> 00:52:42.316]  You've been there many times I'm not there.
[00:52:42.337 --> 00:52:46.220]  It is, it is... It's not like you're looking for kids being smuggled.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.101]  It's just everywhere.
[00:52:47.342 --> 00:52:50.565]  It is... When you go there, it's like Disney World for pedophiles.
[00:52:51.587 --> 00:52:52.408]  That's exactly right.
[00:52:52.728 --> 00:52:52.968]  Yes.
[00:52:53.609 --> 00:53:01.056]  And that's one of the things some of the agents have described to us, the difficulty that they have had dealing with that.
[00:53:01.356 --> 00:53:05.400]  And that's one of the interesting points that was brought up to us just two days ago.
[00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:11.166]  And that was this, that for the first time now, they are seeing recycled kids, Alex.
[00:53:11.446 --> 00:53:15.190]  They are seeing kids that are coming completely bombed out on drugs.
[00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:35.384]  They're putting them on buses, they're sending them to the processing stations, the processing stations are sending them to other areas in the U.S., and within two weeks, Alex, the same kids are coming back across the Mexican border into Texas, and these same Border Patrol agents are processing these same kids.
[00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:42.529]   And they're saying this is the first time that they have seen these kids be recycled In the numbers that they are currently are.
[00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:43.611]  This is so huge.
[00:53:43.691 --> 00:53:45.152]  So Obama first did it.
[00:53:45.172 --> 00:53:46.414]  He said, you got a kid you get across.
[00:53:46.734 --> 00:53:48.336]  They're only a ticket they're using.
[00:53:48.616 --> 00:53:50.919]  Let's come back in two minutes and talk more about that.
[00:53:51.179 --> 00:53:51.980]  This is so important.
[00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:55.164]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:53:55.544 --> 00:53:57.886]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[00:53:58.226 --> 00:54:01.369]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:54:01.409 --> 00:54:04.311]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:54:04.571 --> 00:54:15.159]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[00:54:52.471 --> 00:55:03.978]   Well, we're living in epic times, so finish up the point you were making about how at The lower 90% of the Feds are totally upset.
[00:55:04.279 --> 00:55:05.299]  They see what's happening.
[00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:08.020]  They know they're part of a crime if they don't do something.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.141]  And then they see the media covering it up.
[00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:10.781]  They see all this.
[00:55:10.861 --> 00:55:12.462]  It's creating a crisis of conscience.
[00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:23.847]  And then shifting gears in the next segment, Tim, they're saying imminent white supremacist attack with no evidence against these border facilities, obviously to trigger the NSA system against the American people.
[00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:24.447]  That's come out.
[00:55:26.432 --> 00:55:33.361]  I want to elaborate on that, but just get back to what you were saying before the break about the crisis of conscience with the feds being given these illegal orders.
[00:55:34.462 --> 00:55:34.702]  Right.
[00:55:34.983 --> 00:55:54.003]   And to give you an idea of just how serious it is, the source that I spoke with told me that some of the National Guard members have actually Asked to be taken off this assignment, and I'm talking about specifically the ones who were dealing with the children in the detention centers.
[00:55:54.284 --> 00:56:04.569]  They literally asked to be taken off this assignment because it was traumatizing them seeing these kids coming through their facilities, drugged up, watching them go through withdrawals.
[00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:13.175]  Putting them on buses, only to see them come back two weeks later, back across the border again, drugged up again, going through withdrawals again.
[00:56:13.535 --> 00:56:15.797]  This is something that they said they've never seen before.
[00:56:15.817 --> 00:56:20.900]  And by the way, we're going to pull those videos up since you mentioned it, but there's hundreds of videos of just kids bombed out of their brains.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.361]  You and I went down there.
[00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:23.202]  We're not being pussies.
[00:56:23.242 --> 00:56:24.302]  You've been in a bunch of wars.
[00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:29.046]  You've said to me, I've said, I don't want to go down there because it's so depressing a few days.
[00:56:29.206 --> 00:56:30.727]  Imagine being the Border Patrol.
[00:56:31.937 --> 00:56:32.137]  Right.
[00:56:32.517 --> 00:56:47.143]  Now, Border Patrol and National Guard, the source that I spoke with, that was a National Guard source about the kids, and they were literally telling me that some of their co-workers have asked to be taken off the assignment of working with those children because it was so traumatizing to them.
[00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.865]  I mean, that's the level it's got.
[00:56:49.885 --> 00:56:52.147]  And you were saying they're seeing them again and again.
[00:56:52.167 --> 00:56:53.848]  I mean, what's going on there?
[00:56:53.888 --> 00:56:55.049]  Again and again.
[00:56:55.089 --> 00:56:59.672]  They said literally within two to three weeks, they're cycling back through them again.
[00:56:59.752 --> 00:57:00.752]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:57:01.353 --> 00:57:02.073]  Speak more to that.
[00:57:02.133 --> 00:57:02.714]  That's huge.
[00:57:03.554 --> 00:57:03.754]  Right.
[00:57:04.094 --> 00:57:10.798]  So the way they described it was, right, the kids come across, and these were mostly unaccompanied minors that we're speaking of, right?
[00:57:11.679 --> 00:57:13.180]  Some weren't even being used.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.241]  These are just literally unaccompanied minors.
[00:57:15.601 --> 00:57:23.226]  And one of the things that they were thinking of, the theory was, that some of these kids are being used as drug smugglers, right?
[00:57:23.546 --> 00:57:43.999]   And so they bring them across, they give them drugs, they come across, and then as soon as they're released, They meet up with the cartels, and then transport drugs for the cartels to the interior, wherever the border patrol is sending them, and they drop those drugs off, and then they go back to Mexico to recycle through again.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:53.006]  Because basically, what's happening is, they're getting free armed escort to transport drugs, is what's really happening.
[00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:56.028]  I mean, because the government... So they think they're muling these kids?
[00:57:57.924 --> 00:58:00.972]  100%.
[00:57:57.984 --> 00:58:00.972]  That's the exact word that they described, that they're using them as mules.
[00:58:01.032 --> 00:58:01.292]  Yes.
[00:58:03.157 --> 00:58:04.240]  You can't make this up.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.823]  We know the Democratic Party's getting a big cut.
[00:58:07.614 --> 00:58:09.415]  Somebody's making a lot of money of it, for sure.
[00:58:09.535 --> 00:58:14.498]  And obviously, you know, this whole immigration bit is big business, you know?
[00:58:15.638 --> 00:58:23.122]  And it's a little bit, you know, when we went down to Mission Border Hope here yesterday in El Paso, I mean, in Eagle Pass, right?
[00:58:23.883 --> 00:58:28.045]  They immediately sent security guards out to confront us and said, you have to leave this property.
[00:58:28.065 --> 00:58:30.426]  They didn't want to show the migrants being processed in there.
[00:58:30.687 --> 00:58:36.890]  So we went to a check cashing place and a money exchange place that was next door, separate property.
[00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:41.530]   and the security guard still followed us and told us no you can't stand there either
[00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:48.729]   because we own that check cashing facility as well. So a Christian charity claims to own
[00:58:48.729 --> 00:58:54.410]   a money exchange and check cashing place as well as processing migrants.
[00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.489]  They're farming, they're farming these people.
[00:58:56.489 --> 00:58:58.250]  100 percent.
[00:58:58.437 --> 00:59:13.239]  This is a huge billions of dollar a year operation and it's probably at this point, my guess would be it's actually surpassing narcotics as far as the amount of money that's involved around the globe with human traffic.
[00:59:13.639 --> 00:59:14.560]  All right, we're going to break.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:20.122]  I want to come back and talk about big picture and all the different angles that I haven't raised that you want to raise here, Tim.
[00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:22.423]  We're blessed to have you and the crew down there.
[00:59:22.443 --> 00:59:24.144]  Chase Geiser has filed reports as well.
[00:59:24.504 --> 00:59:26.866]  We're going to get him on to respond.
[00:59:27.006 --> 00:59:28.546]  We're also looking at the economy coming up.
[00:59:29.307 --> 00:59:30.767]  But this is God's work, folks.
[00:59:30.807 --> 00:59:31.768]  This is so important.
[00:59:32.108 --> 00:59:34.449]  I'm so blessed to be here, so honored to work with a crew like this.
[00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:36.510]  Thank you, Lister, for having us on air.
[00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:38.091]  All this work is because of you.
[00:59:38.351 --> 00:59:41.553]  These tens of millions of people aren't being brought in here to be given freedom.
[00:59:42.173 --> 00:59:43.034]  And join our Republic.
[00:59:43.074 --> 00:59:44.316]  They're being exploited.
[00:59:44.977 --> 00:59:54.831]  And I want to just tell listeners and viewers, when history comes by, you can get run over it and dust yourself off and ignore it, or you can decide to be part of it.
[00:59:55.717 --> 01:00:09.823]  We are down there with NSA intel about Biden trying to launch a total national grid, which is illegal, of NSA spying on you with face scanning technology outside of January 6th.
[01:00:09.943 --> 01:00:11.684]  With this, there's a major fight at the NSA.
[01:00:11.704 --> 01:00:13.425]  That is directly from high-level sources.
[01:00:14.085 --> 01:00:15.806]  And we have the huge human trafficking.
[01:00:16.206 --> 01:00:19.769]  We have it all coming out, and children being taken.
[01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.670]  I saw this in the news years ago, now it's confirmed.
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:26.913]  Over and over again is a free ticket as mules, and the Border Patrol ordered not to investigate.
[01:00:27.274 --> 01:00:29.675]  Biden, six months ago, ended the DNA testing.
[01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.416]  It's like $100, takes a day.
[01:00:31.756 --> 01:00:35.579]  This kid doesn't look like your, you know, they can tell it's your mother, father, cousin.
[01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:37.540]  They don't even do DNA testing.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.241]  They're covering their tracks.
[01:00:39.301 --> 01:00:44.399]   And the Border Patrol that signed up to defend this country, Is saying, this is insane.
[01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:46.101]  We're trying to impeach Mayorkas.
[01:00:46.762 --> 01:00:52.910]  Congress is doing some things, but Congress finally, after three years, goes, oh, the border's wide open.
[01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:55.414]  And Mayorkas said, oh no, it's controlled.
[01:00:55.974 --> 01:00:57.496]  He would try that lie for three years.
[01:00:57.556 --> 01:00:58.818]  Now we've moved past that.
[01:00:58.838 --> 01:01:00.540]  Instead of debating that lie.
[01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:06.564]  To now, this is being done with the NGOs and all the money they use for taxpayers to bring them here.
[01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:08.965]  And once they get them here, they sign them up for welfare.
[01:01:09.245 --> 01:01:16.809]  They put them in these slave jobs, sex slavery, children working at tire factories, cereal factories, you know, 15 hours a day.
[01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:18.230]  I mean, this is slavery 2.0.
[01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.312]  So Infowars, head of security, Tim Inlow.
[01:01:21.352 --> 01:01:25.534]  Tim, you've been in the Army, the Marines, Blackwater, federal agent.
[01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:27.536]  You work for the State Department.
[01:01:27.897 --> 01:01:28.778]  You've seen it all.
[01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:29.920]  You've been around the world.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.062]  Have you ever seen anything like this?
[01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:33.427]  Nothing.
[01:01:34.048 --> 01:01:46.099]  I mean, even in countries where we were at war at, we did a better job patrolling and securing the borders of those countries than we are doing here in the United States on our southern border.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.682]  It's just incredible, right?
[01:01:49.042 --> 01:02:02.693]   And, you know, speaking with the PIO, the Press Information Officer from the Texas National Guard in Shelby Park just a couple days ago, you know, he admitted, he said, listen, Uh, we're glad that Governor Abbott is utilizing us down here.
[01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:03.914]  We want to make a difference.
[01:02:04.215 --> 01:02:06.076]  We want to help secure our country.
[01:02:06.396 --> 01:02:13.100]  He's like, but at the end of the day, because I asked him, I said, you know, I'm glad that you guys secured Shelby Park so well.
[01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:18.424]  I said, but I've been just three miles outside of Eagle Pass and there's no barriers at all.
[01:02:18.464 --> 01:02:19.164]  There's no wall.
[01:02:19.184 --> 01:02:19.985]  There's no ballpark.
[01:02:20.025 --> 01:02:20.726]  There's no troops.
[01:02:20.766 --> 01:02:21.366]  There's nothing.
[01:02:21.866 --> 01:02:28.751]  And he said, well, listen, uh, despite the size of the Texas National Guard, he said, we do have limited resources.
[01:02:29.532 --> 01:02:32.036]  And so, we're forced because the federal government's not helping.
[01:02:32.056 --> 01:02:35.502]  Yeah, so that said, at least Abbott, give us your real assessment then.
[01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:36.884]  Is this just a show?
[01:02:36.904 --> 01:02:38.828]  You got 25 states behind us?
[01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.490]  Or is Abbott doing the best he can?
[01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:42.995]  I think it's a combination.
[01:02:43.175 --> 01:02:51.060]  Obviously, I do think that Governor Abbott wants to make a political statement with this, but the National Guard Major was very clear with me.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:03:04.329]  He said, listen, you can look at the numbers of my deployed troops, and unfortunately, there's only so many of us, and we have a budget, and there's only so much Texas by itself can do financially to support this whole operation.
[01:03:04.669 --> 01:03:12.854]   He's saying, so what we have to do is we have to figure out where are the most likely crossing points And then we deploy our resources there.
[01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:21.620]  And the way he explained it to me, the reason Shelby Park became such a focal point, because for many, many years, that park was a low water crossing.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.401]  It's an extremely low water crossing most of the year.
[01:03:24.722 --> 01:03:47.687]   Now, one of the interesting things that happened, Alex, is that the day that we were there, just one day previous on Monday, somebody, and nobody has gotten to the point of who gave this authorization, Someone opened a dam to sit there and flood the Rio Grande and make the current as swift as possible.
[01:03:47.807 --> 01:03:50.090]  And now people have drowned, they've saved children.
[01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:51.832]  That shows the technocracy.
[01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:52.934]  Who's in control of it?
[01:03:53.752 --> 01:03:57.013]  Three bodies, three bodies just in the time we were here, Alex.
[01:03:57.093 --> 01:04:04.756]  So that morning when we were there, an unconscious toddler had gotten flown out into the river, separated from her parents to the National Guard.
[01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:07.637]  By the time they got to her, she was hypothermic and unconscious.
[01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:11.078]  Luckily, they were able to save her and get her to a hospital.
[01:04:11.319 --> 01:04:17.821]  But two more bodies that day and the next day that they weren't able to save that were already drowned.
[01:04:18.061 --> 01:04:26.245]  But somebody opened that dam and right before this convoy is supposed to arrive to make it look like there's not many migrants crossing here.
[01:04:26.765 --> 01:04:45.560]   And the reason I know the major was telling the truth, I talked to a farmer here who is an onion farmer that owns 750 acres of an onion farm and she told me Tim, we have begged them for years and years to open that dam so we could get more water, and they never would.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.886]  And suddenly, just a few days before the convoy arrived, they opened the dam and flooded.
[01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:58.392]   And Alex had caught the National Guard by such surprise that those large Containers that they had on the side of the Rio Grande with
[01:04:58.392 --> 01:05:03.231]   the barbed wire on top They had to scramble to move those containers back
[01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:08.951]   Because they were about to fall into the Rio Grande from the floodwaters from that dam being open so it shows
[01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:13.151]   Biden doesn't want attention on this One hour.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:18.083]  He is still trying to play the game that there's not that many migrants coming across.
[01:05:18.603 --> 01:05:19.964]  And it's obviously a lie.
[01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:22.925]  That's why I love the convoy.
[01:05:22.945 --> 01:05:23.345]  They're great.
[01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.967]  I hope they don't just sit out at some ranch and barbecue.
[01:05:26.427 --> 01:05:30.209]  If they just spread out and get video, the illegals are coming through different points.
[01:05:30.249 --> 01:05:30.909]  We've seen that.
[01:05:31.369 --> 01:05:32.610]  We need eyes and ears.
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.931]  And again, it's not like January 6th where it's one capital.
[01:05:35.211 --> 01:05:36.052]  They're setting us up.
[01:05:36.452 --> 01:05:37.672]  This is our territory.
[01:05:37.712 --> 01:05:38.593]  We're in control here.
[01:05:39.213 --> 01:05:39.433]  Right.
[01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:42.437]  And like you said, you know, the funding for all this, right?
[01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:43.698]  Who is funding?
[01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:50.005]  This is a multi, multi-billion dollar operation to smuggle this many millions of people into this country.
[01:05:50.306 --> 01:06:01.736]   You know, just in the five minutes that we moved locations that came to this new location, We found this debit card, right, from Banco del Pacifico with a Hispanic female's name on it, right?
[01:06:02.196 --> 01:06:03.057]  And they're everywhere.
[01:06:03.097 --> 01:06:04.918]  They're littered along the border everywhere.
[01:06:05.198 --> 01:06:07.120]  Somebody's providing them these debit cards.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.641]  Somebody's providing the clothing.
[01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:12.503]  Somebody's providing them the hygiene items, the phones, everything.
[01:06:12.804 --> 01:06:15.606]  This is billions and billions of dollars, right?
[01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:23.011]  And it's not going to stop until there's a political will to turn that financial spigot off.
[01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:29.692]  All right, let's get Chase Geiser in here, InfoWars reporter.
[01:06:29.973 --> 01:06:30.874]  I appreciate you.
[01:06:30.894 --> 01:06:34.659]  I know you've got, I don't want to even keep you on air because you've got all these other sources.
[01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:36.721]  We're waiting for an imminent attack.
[01:06:36.801 --> 01:06:38.964]  The feds say, let's talk about this briefly.
[01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:53.258]   You were shown by the Border Patrol the memo I mean, so this is not speculation that the feds are saying imminent white supremacist attack against the Border Patrol and quote migrants, so they evacuated the migrants God knows where.
[01:06:53.578 --> 01:06:58.583]  That is a big piece of intel as the pretext to bring in the NSA spying the NSA is bucking.
[01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:01.005]  Right.
[01:07:01.245 --> 01:07:03.987]  Yeah, I mean, literally he showed me the actual FBI memo.
[01:07:04.627 --> 01:07:09.630]  He didn't feel comfortable giving me a copy of it, but he did let me view it and read it, and that's exactly what it said.
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:21.517]  Two white supremacists, sometime between February 2nd and February 5th, we're going to attack the main Border Patrol processing, migrant processing facility on Firefly Lane.
[01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:27.721]  Tim, in closing, what's your assessment of the situation down there?
[01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:31.850]  Well, I do think that there is people in D.C.
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:39.471]  that are hoping or either hoping for or actively instigating a spark to happen down here.
[01:07:39.591 --> 01:07:45.072]  And that's why I know you said you don't want people to sit there and just hang out and barbecue.
[01:07:45.112 --> 01:07:48.473]  And we do need as many cameras on this situation as possible.
[01:07:48.733 --> 01:08:18.429]   But what I'm hearing from the people in the convoy is that the location where they're going to hold their rally is going to be a number of miles away More out of the country away from Shelby Park because they don't want so many people crammed into a tight area like we had in Washington DC where a single spark could set off a confrontation between the authorities and the crowd and give the Biden administration... But the good news is the Border Patrol and others are worried about a false flag.
[01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.250]  They know what to look for.
[01:08:21.438 --> 01:08:24.799]  And my source, Elias, that's exactly the word he used, false flag.
[01:08:25.699 --> 01:08:43.003]  Because he said this isn't the first time they've gotten this from the FBI, that when the Haitians were here two years ago, that the same type of FBI memo was released then when a lot of Americans and a lot of press started making its way to the border to document what the Haitians were up to there under the bridge.
[01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:45.565]  So they're trying to act like we're terrorists for exposing it.
[01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:45.985]  Alright.
[01:08:47.006 --> 01:08:47.706]  Tim, thank you.
[01:08:47.726 --> 01:08:52.689]  We're going to go to break here and air a very important special report on how they're cutting the food off.
[01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:54.249]  We'll come back with Chase Geiser.
[01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:55.670]  You guys are doing a great job.
[01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:56.651]  God bless you and thank you.
[01:08:58.592 --> 01:08:58.912]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:59.412 --> 01:08:59.672]  Alright.
[01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:01.053]  Let me show you this.
[01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:03.854]  And I can show you the London Guardian, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:06.495]  They've cut off a third of the worldwide fertilizer.
[01:09:06.535 --> 01:09:07.756]  That'll cause hundreds of millions of deaths.
[01:09:08.316 --> 01:09:09.337]  I just mumbled that number.
[01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:10.237]  That's a real number.
[01:09:10.257 --> 01:09:11.318]  Like we just say it like it's no big deal.
[01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:18.051]  Globalists will use carbon controls to stop you from growing your own food.
[01:09:18.392 --> 01:09:24.297]  They're announcing that farms and private gardens are evil and plants are bad.
[01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:27.921]  This is on Infowars.com, official UNWF.
[01:09:28.421 --> 01:09:30.723]  This is actually happening.
[01:09:32.425 --> 01:09:32.685]  Alright?
[01:09:34.147 --> 01:09:36.269]  So the Epoch Times has put out a report.
[01:09:38.268 --> 01:09:42.470]  With Alex Newman on No Farmers, No Food, You Will Eat the Bugs.
[01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:44.732]  This is how evil these people are.
[01:09:45.132 --> 01:09:55.637]  Fentanyl's fine, pedophilia's fine, but cabbage and tomatoes and zucchini and everything is evil.
[01:09:55.898 --> 01:09:56.258]  Here it is.
[01:09:57.546 --> 01:10:01.589]  At some point down the line, the narrative changed to be around climate.
[01:10:01.929 --> 01:10:03.690]  What was the narrative prior to that?
[01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:08.934]  What was the justification they were giving in order to push, you know, this kind of more control from the top down?
[01:10:09.254 --> 01:10:17.599]  Yeah, immediately preceding climate and environment, actually the Cold War was the pretext for having this incredibly large, incredibly powerful federal government.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:27.466]  In fact, you see a very clear break when the Club of Rome met in 1991 as the Soviet state and the Eastern European communist states were collapsing.
[01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:32.605]   The Club of Rome, very very powerful elitist, obviously Mikhail Gorbachev was there, you
[01:10:32.605 --> 01:10:37.085]   had many prominent Americans, people like Al Gore, they got together and they came up
[01:10:37.085 --> 01:10:42.885]   with this incredible document where they actually said we need a new justification for this
[01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:44.405]  all-powerful state.
[01:10:44.405 --> 01:10:48.605]   So the new excuse is going to be because the environment is going to be harmed and because
[01:10:48.605 --> 01:10:50.605]  climate is going to hurt us.
[01:10:50.605 --> 01:10:52.765]  Wait, what?
[01:10:52.765 --> 01:10:54.164]  I could not believe what I just heard.
[01:10:54.876 --> 01:11:00.798]  Did world leaders really lay out this globalist plan in plain English, in a physical book, way back in 1991?
[01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:04.358]  I went on Amazon, and there it was.
[01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:18.541]  The first global revolution, which states, and I quote, In searching for a common enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like, would fit the bill.
[01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:22.583]  And therefore, the real enemy is humanity itself.
[01:11:24.024 --> 01:11:25.204]  The science is clear.
[01:11:25.925 --> 01:11:29.407]  We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return.
[01:11:30.723 --> 01:11:32.024]  The science is very clear.
[01:11:32.484 --> 01:11:35.327]  This natural world is severely endangered.
[01:11:35.687 --> 01:11:36.988]  Code red for humanity.
[01:11:37.008 --> 01:11:39.129]  It's not a group of political officials, elected officials.
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:40.410]  These are the scientists.
[01:11:40.751 --> 01:11:46.215]  There is a top-down quality to this policy, which is extremely forceful.
[01:11:46.475 --> 01:11:53.300]  And the forcefulness comes from scientism, which is the ideology that we understand the world fully because of science.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.183]  We have to listen to the science so that we have a better future for tomorrow.
[01:11:57.503 --> 01:11:59.964]  This is just ideological BS.
[01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:01.825]  And it's also quite dangerous.
[01:12:02.005 --> 01:12:08.028]  It's a dangerous way of looking at the world because then it means nothing matters apart from science.
[01:12:08.789 --> 01:12:09.709]  Culture doesn't matter.
[01:12:09.729 --> 01:12:10.850]  History doesn't matter.
[01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.070]  Religion doesn't matter.
[01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:13.551]  Social interaction doesn't matter.
[01:12:13.671 --> 01:12:15.732]  Nothing matters but science.
[01:12:16.272 --> 01:12:23.176]  You don't need to be a theologian or philosopher to understand that that's complete nonsense, but also dangerous nonsense.
[01:12:23.656 --> 01:12:28.958]   If nothing matters than just science, Then what kind of a world do we actually live in?
[01:12:29.759 --> 01:12:33.701]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:42.045]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:46.588]  The World Economic Forum is actually a critical part of implementing this UN agenda.
[01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:52.411]  Some years ago they became a strategic partner of the UN in the implementation of Agenda 2030.
[01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:56.533]  And then you start looking at the connections between the World Economic Forum and China.
[01:12:56.853 --> 01:12:59.115]  Klaus Schwab and Xi Jinping, they're like old buddies.
[01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.356]  They put out press releases about how much they love each other.
[01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:08.020]  So you've got the super capitalists, represented by the World Economic Forum, and then on the government side, you have communists.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:16.005]  After Agenda 2030 was adopted, the Communist Party in China put out, through all their propaganda organs, they said, we played a critical role in this Agenda 2030.
[01:13:16.265 --> 01:13:20.768]  You had Javier Solana, the head of NATO, saying this was going to be the next great leap forward.
[01:13:21.289 --> 01:13:23.415]  The last great leap forward in China killed millions of people.
[01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:24.819]  Why would we want another one of those?
[01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:25.659]  So that's crazy.
[01:13:25.659 --> 01:13:38.078]   So you have communists and super capitalists all coming together and working on this one
[01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:40.319]  sustainable development agenda.
[01:13:40.274 --> 01:13:44.516]  And that should make us all pause and say, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense on the surface.
[01:13:44.536 --> 01:13:45.316]  What's going on here?
[01:13:45.616 --> 01:13:55.640]  China is a powerful example of what can be achieved when national governments make environmental protection a top priority.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:01.222]  The motivations of those who are pushing this agenda, many of them tend to emulate countries like China.
[01:14:01.442 --> 01:14:03.764]  Which have abysmal environmental records.
[01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:06.606]  This is a country that has massive pollution problems.
[01:14:06.946 --> 01:14:09.729]  They don't seem to care about rivers and lakes and streams.
[01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:11.650]  There's all sorts of toxins pouring into them.
[01:14:12.411 --> 01:14:22.839]  In actuality, I would say their envy of China is more to do with their control over their population and control over politics than it has to do with the environment.
[01:14:23.639 --> 01:14:27.763]  In looking at this, it looks like the environment's a tool to achieve power.
[01:14:28.403 --> 01:14:31.725]  More than it is an end goal of itself to actually protect nature.
[01:14:33.647 --> 01:14:37.089]  We're doing incredibly important work, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.751]  We believe in humanity.
[01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:40.972]  We're not out to screw people over.
[01:14:41.012 --> 01:14:44.214]  We believe in prosperity and free market and the Christian ethos.
[01:14:44.795 --> 01:14:47.276]  Chase Geiser has been there for three, four days at the border.
[01:14:47.937 --> 01:14:49.158]  He's seen incredible things.
[01:14:49.238 --> 01:14:59.186]   Wow, he's right in the middle of such a giant story that if listeners get excited about this at RealAlexJones and InfoWars.com, Absolutely crazy, Alex, and overwhelming.
[01:14:59.206 --> 01:15:01.387]  You know, it's really interesting.
[01:15:01.207 --> 01:15:08.227]   Biden rolling it out against the American people January 6 10.0. This is so insane Chase Geiser
[01:15:08.227 --> 01:15:13.686]   We got about six minutes till break. I want to get your take down on the border what you make of all this huge news
[01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:20.757]   It's absolutely crazy Alex and overwhelming, you know, it's really interesting you just mentioned the sort of schism
[01:15:20.757 --> 01:15:26.127]   happening between Authorities at Fort Meade
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.602]  It reminds me a little bit of the Epstein case.
[01:15:27.642 --> 01:15:36.551]  One of the things that's so interesting about the Epstein case to me, Alex, is how there's all this cover-up that's happening on the one hand, but yet there's all this prosecution that's happening on the other hand.
[01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:44.279]  So one wonders, why is it that they're even prosecuting Epstein if they're gonna try to cover up all the details afterward and it just comes...
[01:15:44.759 --> 01:15:47.340]  To me, it strikes me as indicative of a schism.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:53.543]  There's black hats and white hats within these intelligence communities, whether it's the NSA, whether it's the CIA or the FBI.
[01:15:53.823 --> 01:16:03.527]  I think they're constantly at war with one another on whether or not they're going to take this Machiavellian approach to leadership, or they're going to try to do the right thing always by the American people.
[01:16:03.567 --> 01:16:09.630]   And so to hear that there's this schism happening right now, this controversy, this conflict at Fort Meade, Well, let's be clear.
[01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:11.952]  It's about targeting the American people as terrorists.
[01:16:12.012 --> 01:16:13.493]  And it's about legitimizing that whole rollout.
[01:16:13.513 --> 01:16:17.836]  The fact the NSA is fighting it, the Border Patrol is fighting it, is a beautiful thing.
[01:16:17.757 --> 01:16:21.437]   that are coming here is fascinating and terrifying to me at the same time, Alex.
[01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:25.197]   Well, let's be clear. It's about targeting the American people as terrorists.
[01:16:25.197 --> 01:16:30.637]   It's about legitimizing that whole rollout. The fact the NSA is fighting it,
[01:16:30.637 --> 01:16:35.276]   the Border Patrol is fighting it is a beautiful thing. What are you guys gonna be covering next?
[01:16:35.276 --> 01:16:42.157]   Well, today we are doing everything that we can to get notifications or news or insight as to
[01:16:42.157 --> 01:16:48.636]   what's developing specifically with this FBI warning at the facility on Firefly Lane here.
[01:16:48.793 --> 01:16:53.636]  We're also going to be exploring whether or not there's any migrant crossings that we're going to be able to capture or follow as well.
[01:16:53.936 --> 01:17:10.017]   Shelby Park has been restricted by Major Mike Perry, which is the first time we've seen the park restricted both to the public and They're using that false, I believe false, FBI report of white supremacist imminent attack.
[01:17:10.398 --> 01:17:12.041]  And by the way, why is that in the news?
[01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:13.584]  Because they want to do it behind the scenes.
[01:17:14.807 --> 01:17:15.487]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:15.527 --> 01:17:26.014]  You know, it is interesting though, they mentioned specifically militiamen, and we have noticed several militias that are coming into the community here from all over the United States, too, specifically.
[01:17:26.034 --> 01:17:29.916]  And again, we're not against the militia, it's constitutional, but is it like Whitmer?
[01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:32.558]  Are these really feds posing as militia?
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:42.365]  Well, I find it hard to believe, Alex, that there's a single militia in the United States that hasn't been infiltrated, at least in some way, by a federal agent from one of the three-letter agencies.
[01:17:42.605 --> 01:17:48.248]  Just as a matter of national security, I would find it incredibly hard to believe they wouldn't be involved within each of these organizations.
[01:17:48.548 --> 01:17:58.674]  And in the event that this FBI warning is true, which it could very well be a false flag, like you mentioned, but in the event that it's true, I imagine that the intel that they have would be because they have somebody on the inside of the militia.
[01:18:00.255 --> 01:18:00.715]  Absolutely.
[01:18:00.735 --> 01:18:01.676]  A few minutes we have left.
[01:18:01.716 --> 01:18:03.477]  What else is on your radar down there at the border?
[01:18:04.969 --> 01:18:12.134]  Well, today we're going to be scouring every location and following up with some leads that we've gotten about where certain crossings are happening.
[01:18:12.174 --> 01:18:20.720]  It seems that the actual crossings, Alex, are happening further and further away from Eagle Pass specifically, since all this attention has come on this specific community here.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:28.365]  So we're going to be going further and further out in the surrounding area, up against the river, to try to see if we can capture any of these migrants who are crossing.
[01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:31.427]  And we'll be following up with leads that we have from several of the locals as well.
[01:18:32.366 --> 01:18:37.871]  Well, I don't think Joe Biden is very happy right now, because their whole operation is being blown wide open.
[01:18:39.112 --> 01:18:41.154]  Their whole operation is being blown wide open.
[01:18:41.534 --> 01:18:53.125]  It's amazing the level of incompetence that we see from the Biden administration, not only in terms of their actual leadership and their actual policies that they advocate, but in terms of their inability to sort of cover up their own screw-up.
[01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:58.250]  They're constantly screwing up, constantly lying about it, and it would be funny if it wasn't so terrible, Alex.
[01:18:59.511 --> 01:19:02.294]  Alright, I've got a lot of questions, but what else is on your radar?
[01:19:03.775 --> 01:19:10.842]  Well, today we're going to really focus on keeping an eye on this story as it develops on Firefly Lane.
[01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:15.261]   Our prayer here is that nothing actually happens to this facility, that there is no attack,
[01:19:15.261 --> 01:19:19.181]   because in the event that there is an attack, whether it's a legitimate attack or a false
[01:19:19.181 --> 01:19:23.721]   flag attack, Alex, it's only going to make the MAGA movement look bad, the America First
[01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:26.501]  movement look bad, the populist movement look bad.
[01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:29.860]   You have heard time and time again, just as the audience here on Infowars has heard time
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:35.060]   and time again, the Biden regime referred to American patriots as domestic terrorists,
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:39.621]   right-wing extremists, white supremacists, and this only serves that narrative when there
[01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:40.621]  are these attacks.
[01:19:40.621 --> 01:19:45.581]   So any sort of militia that would desire to do something like this, or just sort of rogue
[01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:57.607]   actor that would desire to do something like this, I I just want to express to the audience and to the world, frankly, for that matter, that that is not a representation or reflection of this MAGA movement of MAGA republicanism or of the America First Populist Movement.
[01:19:57.687 --> 01:19:59.648]  Alex, this is not something that represents us.
[01:19:59.668 --> 01:20:06.570]  So whether the FBI does it or whether it's a rogue actor that does these attacks, it is not a representation of our movement and what we stand for.
[01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:09.931]  We stand for peaceful civil disobedience only when necessary.
[01:20:10.332 --> 01:20:19.934]  No violence, only self-defense, and just getting our country back through legal means, through righteous means, and through those means that are protected by the Bill of Rights in our constitutionality.
[01:20:21.172 --> 01:20:21.672]  Well, that's right.
[01:20:21.753 --> 01:20:26.417]  I put an ex-post out, formerly Twitter, about some silly, funny thing.
[01:20:26.437 --> 01:20:27.417]  It gets 5 million views.
[01:20:27.457 --> 01:20:31.801]  But this has got only a few million views today on ex-Ariel Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.222 --> 01:20:33.383]  This is a big deal.
[01:20:33.423 --> 01:20:42.310]  This is the feds saying white supremacists with no evidence are about to attack, evacuating people, doing all this to cover up Biden's open border.
[01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:44.952]  This story needs to be number one.
[01:20:45.433 --> 01:20:48.796]  How would you, in a 60-second summation, describe the story you're covering?
[01:20:50.126 --> 01:20:55.048]  I would say that what we have captured is a false flag operation before it happened.
[01:20:55.228 --> 01:21:01.971]  We say on this network a lot of times, while other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:06.033]  And this is an example of something that's about to happen, that has yet to happen.
[01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:15.497]   Hopefully we can get the word out enough to prevent it from happening, similar to what happened in September with the mask mandate warning that we were able to send out about PSA and things of that nature.
[01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:18.940]  Reinstating some of these policies from the pandemic the first time around.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:22.802]  We were able to prevent that by getting the word out and raising enough awareness and alarm.
[01:21:23.002 --> 01:21:25.264]  Let's do the same thing for this false flag operation.
[01:21:25.284 --> 01:21:31.148]  Go to at real Alex Jones on X at InfoWars on X at Real Chase Geyser on X. Share the story.
[01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:33.550]  Retweet these posts with as many people as possible.
[01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:37.513]  We did do an updated post on your profile about 45 minutes ago or so.
[01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:40.315]  If everybody can reshare that, that'll make all the difference in the world, I think.
[01:21:41.039 --> 01:21:41.620]  Absolutely.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:52.889]  We're down there in real time with good patriots in our government exposing the fact that the Border Patrol believes they're trying to stage a false flag and it's got to be shaken up the establishment that hopefully we can stop them from doing it.
[01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:53.850]  That's our main mission.
[01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:55.251]  Chase Geiser, Godspeed.
[01:21:55.271 --> 01:21:56.132]  We'll talk to you guys soon.
[01:21:57.153 --> 01:21:57.753]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:21:58.354 --> 01:21:59.114]  Media matters.
[01:21:59.575 --> 01:22:00.536]  The Democratic Party.
[01:22:01.545 --> 01:22:07.856]  MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[01:22:08.498 --> 01:22:10.361]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[01:22:11.222 --> 01:22:12.404]  Go f*** yourselves!
[01:22:14.153 --> 01:22:20.459]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:34.013]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[01:22:34.774 --> 01:22:35.195]  F*** you!
[01:22:35.735 --> 01:22:43.761]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[01:22:44.161 --> 01:22:48.144]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[01:22:48.565 --> 01:22:57.291]  Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[01:22:58.212 --> 01:23:07.256]  So the criminals that have hijacked the federal government are saying white supremacists are imminently about to attack illegal aliens at the border and the Border Patrol.
[01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.698]  The Border Patrol is meeting with us saying it's all a giant lie.
[01:23:11.058 --> 01:23:12.218]  They believe it's a false flag.
[01:23:12.259 --> 01:23:14.940]  The NSA is refusing to turn on face scanning cameras.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:15.560]  It's illegal.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.401]  This is like huge stories within huge stories.
[01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:21.003]  And we'll have more on this as it unfolds.
[01:23:21.143 --> 01:23:25.925]  Our guys are dialed in, have the trust of the state and the feds.
[01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:27.642]  It's incredible.
[01:23:27.963 --> 01:23:31.225]  Now I wanted to get him on last week, but he was busy and couldn't come on.
[01:23:31.565 --> 01:23:40.231]  But we have Kurt Elliott, who is a multiple PhD in Public Policy Administration focused on Monetary Economics and a second PhD in Theology.
[01:23:42.961 --> 01:23:44.042]  He's coming to town tonight.
[01:23:44.082 --> 01:23:50.507]  We're doing a special live show tomorrow, noon central on the economy, on the debt, on the world.
[01:23:51.268 --> 01:23:53.370]  And he's also a sponsor of the broadcast.
[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:59.215]  If you want to get bullion gold at the lowest prices delivered to you, no BS, this is the place to go.
[01:23:59.975 --> 01:24:01.476]  K-E-P-M.
[01:24:01.516 --> 01:24:05.399]  That's K-E-P-M dot com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.801]  But listeners love him.
[01:24:07.821 --> 01:24:16.408]  So I was going to have him on like once a month and do some basic sponsorship stuff, but the listeners love him and he's a great analyst.
[01:24:16.428 --> 01:24:17.349]  I think he's dead on.
[01:24:17.769 --> 01:24:23.153]  So K-E-P-M dot com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[01:24:22.972 --> 01:24:26.252]  or 720-605-3900.
[01:24:26.252 --> 01:24:29.712]  So important to get prepared as best you can.
[01:24:29.712 --> 01:24:35.472]   Giving us a prelude, you sent me a giant analysis of talking points and key points and PowerPoints.
[01:24:35.472 --> 01:24:41.552]   We'll be covering tomorrow noon central at infowars.com/show and Relox Jones on X.
[01:24:41.552 --> 01:24:46.752]   But this article you sent me a week ago, from dystopia to utopia and gold and silver,
[01:24:46.752 --> 01:24:49.552]  the claims that inflation's beat, what's really going on?
[01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:51.984]  Give us a prelude of what's coming up tomorrow at noon central.
[01:24:53.402 --> 01:24:58.665]  So there is so much Alex since we talked last when I was on the show.
[01:24:59.205 --> 01:25:10.511]  So the biggest news for silver and everybody who's watching this show who's invested in in gold silver over the last couple of years is going to be really happy about this.
[01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:20.220]   So we all know that there's been manipulation in the markets, you know, when you've got Corporations like BlackRock that own the silver ETF, SLV.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.782]  Explain that, JP!
[01:25:21.922 --> 01:25:23.765]  Naked shorting to keep it artificially low.
[01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:28.173]  Yeah, I mean, this is why so but you look at this naked short.
[01:25:28.193 --> 01:25:29.194]  So how does that work?
[01:25:29.654 --> 01:25:36.719]  So BlackRock will give Chase JP Morgan Chase, who's basically the custodian of physical metals behind the silver ETF.
[01:25:37.279 --> 01:25:39.021]  They'll say, hey, Chase, you got it.
[01:25:39.061 --> 01:25:41.082]  You got to buy 10 million ounces of silver, whatever.
[01:25:41.322 --> 01:25:42.263]  So what does Chase do?
[01:25:42.363 --> 01:25:43.624]  They issue naked shorts.
[01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:44.744]  It drives the price down.
[01:25:44.785 --> 01:25:47.766]  They gobble up a bunch of physical silver that creates demand.
[01:25:47.807 --> 01:25:48.727]  The price goes up.
[01:25:49.027 --> 01:25:50.488]  They don't like it that it gets so high.
[01:25:50.528 --> 01:25:51.849]  They issue more naked shorts.
[01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:53.270]  They buy more physical silver.
[01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:54.371]  So here's the thing.
[01:25:55.031 --> 01:25:59.972]  They're, they're using naked shorts not because they hate silver, but because they love it, right?
[01:25:59.992 --> 01:26:01.293]  And they want to buy it at low price.
[01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:04.313]  Chinese, all the governments, they're hoarding it.
[01:26:05.654 --> 01:26:05.814]  Yeah.
[01:26:06.234 --> 01:26:06.434]  Yeah.
[01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:17.917]  I mean, central banks around the world, Alex, are buying gold by not the pound or ounce or by, by the ton, but literally by the hundreds or thousands of tons.
[01:26:18.297 --> 01:26:19.577]  That's a lot of gold.
[01:26:20.037 --> 01:26:21.317]  So here's one thing.
[01:26:21.357 --> 01:26:23.838]  So they tell the public, don't touch it while they're gobbling it up.
[01:26:24.622 --> 01:26:27.684]  Yeah, and you expose these kind of things all the time.
[01:26:27.744 --> 01:26:30.045]  It's like, don't listen to what they say.
[01:26:30.265 --> 01:26:33.487]  Watch what they do because actions speak louder than words, right?
[01:26:33.987 --> 01:26:38.270]  And they are buying gold like there's nobody's business, right?
[01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:43.873]  So you look at though, even with manipulation, silver in the year 2000 was like $4.58 an ounce.
[01:26:43.893 --> 01:26:45.334]  Three and a half years ago, it was $11.91.
[01:26:45.374 --> 01:26:45.994]  15, 16 months ago, it was $17.97.
[01:26:46.235 --> 01:26:53.355]   3 and a half years ago it was $11.91, 15-16 months ago it was $17.97, today it's over $23.
[01:26:53.355 --> 01:26:54.355]  So even...
[01:26:54.355 --> 01:26:55.355]  All-time high!
[01:26:55.719 --> 01:26:56.320]  All-time high.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:00.440]  Well, not on silver, but on gold, we're near an all-time high.
[01:27:00.821 --> 01:27:01.541]  But here's the thing.
[01:27:01.981 --> 01:27:07.622]  Even with manipulation, silver's gone from $4.58 an ounce to over 23 in the last 20 years.
[01:27:07.982 --> 01:27:10.863]  Last three and a half years, it's doubled.
[01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:12.043]  $11.91 to over 23.
[01:27:12.503 --> 01:27:13.043]  Good grief.
[01:27:13.443 --> 01:27:14.784]  That's with manipulation.
[01:27:14.824 --> 01:27:17.644]  That's almost 100% return over the last three and a half years.
[01:27:17.664 --> 01:27:19.105]  So what happens when the manipulation ends?
[01:27:19.225 --> 01:27:20.545]  Or how long can they manipulate?
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:23.422]  It's through the roof, Alex.
[01:27:23.802 --> 01:27:24.523]  It's through the roof.
[01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:29.307]  Because without manipulation, the price has no check on it, right?
[01:27:30.207 --> 01:27:31.969]  So it's based on supply and demand.
[01:27:32.369 --> 01:27:41.177]  Well, with all of the energy policies that we're seeing, you know, green energy, solar power, EVs, you know, with fuel cell technology, that all requires silver.
[01:27:41.477 --> 01:27:43.018]  Electronics requires silver.
[01:27:43.338 --> 01:27:45.220]  So there's tons of manufacturing demand.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.162]  So they can no longer suppress it as good as they could?
[01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:50.429]  Yes, and so here's what's interesting.
[01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:57.591]  This is why this story about the shorts from Dystopia to Utopia that where you have that article.
[01:27:58.551 --> 01:28:05.252]  Biggest news for silver, I think, since I've been in the business since the early 2000s, like it's been 20 something years.
[01:28:05.772 --> 01:28:15.254]  So what happens when you have a short position open and the price of silver goes up, you lose money hand over fist.
[01:28:15.854 --> 01:28:19.357]  You make money if you have a short position and the price goes down.
[01:28:19.857 --> 01:28:34.729]  So what happened two weeks ago is that the major banks, you know, the JP Morgans of the world, the Bank of America, these big major banks eliminated, they dismantled, they unraveled their short positions by what amount?
[01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:42.875]  50% of all net short positions in the world were eliminated in one 7-day period.
[01:28:42.915 --> 01:28:45.757]  So for folks that own this professionally, what does that signify?
[01:28:46.798 --> 01:28:53.502]  That signifies if you've got these short positions and you think the price is going up, you're going to unravel them fast.
[01:28:54.083 --> 01:29:00.547]  I've never seen 50% of any net short position in any market go away that quickly.
[01:29:00.567 --> 01:29:01.968]  So they're moving way back from shorting?
[01:29:03.396 --> 01:29:04.677]  They've been shorting for a long time.
[01:29:05.077 --> 01:29:06.118]  I mean, really a long time.
[01:29:06.479 --> 01:29:08.981]  So we're talking decades, right?
[01:29:09.381 --> 01:29:21.731]  So when you've got 50% of all open short positions are dismantled and eliminated in one week, that signifies to me that behind the scenes, they're expecting prices to go through the roof.
[01:29:21.811 --> 01:29:26.215]  I was about to say, I'm not a rocket scientist, but if they're getting off shorting silver, that's pretty obvious.
[01:29:26.835 --> 01:29:28.776]  Yeah, because short positions are leveraged.
[01:29:29.237 --> 01:29:31.278]  So it's not just dollar for dollar.
[01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:33.880]  It's highly leveraged.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.381]  So they would lose money hand over fist.
[01:29:36.441 --> 01:29:40.844]  So when they get rid of it that quick, that tells me that they think prices are going up.
[01:29:40.904 --> 01:29:49.310]  So just last week then, silver went from $22.13 to over $23.30 an ounce in about a week.
[01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:53.433]  So this is after these short positions were eliminated.
[01:29:53.893 --> 01:29:55.614]  Silver goes up, what, about 5% in a week?
[01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:02.041]  I mean, you multiply that out by a year, that's, well, 52 weeks in a year.
[01:30:02.141 --> 01:30:06.566]  I mean, we're on pace for like a couple hundred percent growth in silver at that rate, right?
[01:30:06.586 --> 01:30:12.793]  But this tells me that whatever they were expecting to cause silver to go up is starting to happen.
[01:30:13.213 --> 01:30:14.555]  And this is really exciting.
[01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:15.456]  So let's talk about that.
[01:30:15.516 --> 01:30:16.137]  What does that mean?
[01:30:16.157 --> 01:30:17.058]  What are the things going to happen?
[01:30:18.342 --> 01:30:20.764]  Well, why does silver go up?
[01:30:21.044 --> 01:30:23.386]  Because of inflationary pressures, right?
[01:30:23.567 --> 01:30:26.049]  Silver's a thing, gold is a thing, cars are a thing.
[01:30:26.489 --> 01:30:30.653]  Things go up with inflation, so they're expecting the inflationary pressures to persist.
[01:30:31.113 --> 01:30:35.357]  This is why- And so they're lying about inflation, and none of us need to even read a newspaper.
[01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.359]  Everybody knows inflation's out of control.
[01:30:37.439 --> 01:30:38.120]  It's not been fixed.
[01:30:39.353 --> 01:30:45.639]  So tomorrow, I want to watch a video of Jerome Powell saying, this economy is good.
[01:30:45.959 --> 01:30:47.920]  We've got inflation in check.
[01:30:48.301 --> 01:30:55.807]  But then Yellen came out two days ago, let's get that club, I went to play yesterday, and she said, oh, Americans need to get used to high prices.
[01:30:56.347 --> 01:30:57.308]  And used to inflation.
[01:30:57.328 --> 01:31:00.471]  So wait, one side's telling us it's all fixed, the other side's getting used to it.
[01:31:01.598 --> 01:31:03.559]  Yeah, so here's what's interesting, Alex.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:21.671]  A few weeks ago, when I was on your show, I said that even though they're promising that interest rates are going to come down over in 2024, I said there's no way that they're going to have prolonged interest rate reductions because they haven't killed the inflationary monster yet.
[01:31:21.971 --> 01:31:22.632]  They have not.
[01:31:23.052 --> 01:31:24.373]  And sure enough, what happened?
[01:31:24.913 --> 01:31:29.839]  Even though they promised to lower rates, Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen, Biden himself, you know what?
[01:31:30.079 --> 01:31:30.740]  What did they do?
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.965]  They paused rates again for the fourth time in a row, rather than lowering them.
[01:31:35.045 --> 01:31:35.846]  Because why?
[01:31:36.467 --> 01:31:40.231]  Because they think that inflation is going to persist, right?
[01:31:40.271 --> 01:31:42.173]  So why is it going to persist?
[01:31:42.754 --> 01:31:46.256]  Because of the BRICS nation taking away demand for the U.S.
[01:31:46.276 --> 01:31:46.937]  dollar globally.
[01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:57.423]  What Biden just did, which I want to do a deeper dive on this tomorrow, Biden just put economic sanctions on American companies for the first time I've ever seen.
[01:31:57.463 --> 01:31:59.364]  And now he's going to sanction Israel.
[01:31:59.884 --> 01:32:00.484]  Did you see that?
[01:32:00.504 --> 01:32:00.585]  Yeah.
[01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:01.745]  What is that?
[01:32:01.765 --> 01:32:02.286]  Yes, I did.
[01:32:02.826 --> 01:32:04.207]  So what did he sanction?
[01:32:05.285 --> 01:32:09.428]  Producers of liquefied natural gas in America.
[01:32:09.488 --> 01:32:14.252]  He's basically pausing all applications for exports to the rest of the world.
[01:32:14.312 --> 01:32:14.752]  And that's huge.
[01:32:14.792 --> 01:32:16.293]  People don't know energy is everything.
[01:32:16.353 --> 01:32:17.994]  It's like fertilizer for plants.
[01:32:18.435 --> 01:32:22.878]  Why would he kill mainly Texas industry and say no more liquefied gas export?
[01:32:22.918 --> 01:32:23.679]  I mean that is huge.
[01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:24.779]  Barely made the news.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.803]  Well, he claims it's for climate change, right?
[01:32:28.283 --> 01:32:36.514]  But I think the timing is weird because it's going on during the Texas mayhem that's happening between the feds and the state of Texas, right?
[01:32:36.574 --> 01:32:39.718]  So to me, it looks and smells punitive.
[01:32:39.938 --> 01:32:41.200]  To me, it's like, you know what?
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:42.201]  We're going to pause this.
[01:32:42.241 --> 01:32:43.443]  What's going to happen with that?
[01:32:43.883 --> 01:32:46.686]  We are really good in America at oil and gas.
[01:32:46.926 --> 01:32:48.627]  It's one of our specialty areas.
[01:32:48.948 --> 01:32:52.390]  And if he's saying you guys can't do this anymore, you know what?
[01:32:52.551 --> 01:32:57.995]  Economic sanctions, Alex, are usually held as policies against a rogue terrorist.
[01:32:58.055 --> 01:32:58.416]  That's right.
[01:32:58.476 --> 01:32:58.796]  War.
[01:32:58.836 --> 01:32:59.317]  It's war.
[01:32:59.357 --> 01:32:59.697]  It's war.
[01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:00.958]  Russia or something like that.
[01:33:01.258 --> 01:33:03.680]  He did it on our own people, on our own country.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.821]  So that's what I said yesterday.
[01:33:04.841 --> 01:33:06.383]  So this is a sanction against America.
[01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:12.107]  Yeah, and I can't remember a time when this has been done to this extreme, right?
[01:33:12.127 --> 01:33:13.267]  Because what's that going to do?
[01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:22.991]  It's going to hamper jobs, it's going to hamper job growth, and now you're going to have so much unemployment that their government tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:33:23.011 --> 01:33:23.692]  Remember what he did?
[01:33:23.732 --> 01:33:27.553]  A year ago, he lifted sanctions on Venezuela to get their oil.
[01:33:27.733 --> 01:33:29.254]  Why doesn't he want us to produce it?
[01:33:32.095 --> 01:33:33.716]  I think this is all political.
[01:33:34.356 --> 01:33:38.238]  This is economic ramifications of political consequences.
[01:33:38.638 --> 01:33:40.879]  And they're not even thinking 2nd, 3rd, 4th order.
[01:33:40.899 --> 01:33:41.519]  They're just doing it.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.500]  They're just doing it.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:46.462]  They're not looking at the consequences of their action.
[01:33:46.802 --> 01:33:50.563]  The unintended consequences of what's going to happen is job losses.
[01:33:50.804 --> 01:33:53.765]  People now going to the government for unemployment insurance.
[01:33:54.085 --> 01:33:55.286]  You look at the tax stock.
[01:33:55.306 --> 01:33:58.247]  Well yeah, I mean our number one export is, the only thing we have left is energy.
[01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:00.764]  Yeah, and they're cutting that off.
[01:34:00.784 --> 01:34:03.088]  That is so, it's so criminal.
[01:34:03.148 --> 01:34:04.670]  I mean, it's so hard to believe they did it.
[01:34:06.064 --> 01:34:14.547]  It's counterintuitive and it makes no sense other than they hate, they hate petroleum-based products.
[01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:27.212]  They want this green world and so now is their time and with Texas going on, everything going on in Texas, they now figured this is their chance to strike and they're going to basically say this is because of climate change and all that kind of garbage.
[01:34:27.232 --> 01:34:31.834]  And now Texas is going to sit on top of all this gas for the world that they load on those ships.
[01:34:32.694 --> 01:34:33.534]  That's incredible.
[01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:38.515]  It's so, for people that don't know folks, it's like cutting your paycheck off.
[01:34:38.555 --> 01:34:40.056]  I mean, that's what we have is energy.
[01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:41.316]  Yeah.
[01:34:41.696 --> 01:34:47.938]  How is Putin, like whether you love Putin or hate him, Putin, Russia's more powerful now than ever because they're selling oil and gas to everybody.
[01:34:48.478 --> 01:34:49.558]  That's why they blow up the pipeline.
[01:34:49.858 --> 01:34:53.679]  So Biden's not just blowing up Russian pipelines, he's cutting our pipelines off.
[01:34:56.185 --> 01:34:59.286]  He's cutting, he's basically slitting our own throat.
[01:34:59.926 --> 01:35:14.471]  I mean, there's not much better in America that we're good at other than oil and gas, and he's taking the most productive thing that we have, and this is going to impact people in Texas and Louisiana and Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Arizona, Colorado, right?
[01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:19.532]  I mean, we do a lot of natural gas really well in this country.
[01:35:19.552 --> 01:35:24.114]  Oh, if you go down to Houston, there's 50 ships loading liquid natural gas right now.
[01:35:24.134 --> 01:35:25.434]  Now they're just like, sorry, can't sell.
[01:35:26.889 --> 01:35:27.791]  Wow!
[01:35:29.333 --> 01:35:32.098]  And those are paychecks to all those people that have gas wells on their property.
[01:35:32.842 --> 01:35:34.643]  And all the engineers that drill the wells.
[01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:36.864]  Gosh!
[01:35:37.524 --> 01:35:39.785]  Consider the implications of this, Alex.
[01:35:40.245 --> 01:35:42.226]  Income tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:35:42.686 --> 01:35:44.447]  Sales tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:35:44.487 --> 01:35:46.788]  As people lose their jobs, they're not going to spend money.
[01:35:46.808 --> 01:35:50.690]  We're the biggest natural gas exporter in the world.
[01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:51.490]  He's cutting it off.
[01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:52.911]  I mean, it's sensational.
[01:35:52.931 --> 01:35:56.552]  But it's like the average person is like, oh, a little factoid.
[01:35:56.912 --> 01:35:58.053]  Why do I care about natural gas?
[01:35:58.313 --> 01:36:00.394]  Because it frickin' runs the economy, people.
[01:36:02.079 --> 01:36:02.299]  Yeah.
[01:36:02.559 --> 01:36:04.320]  So, ramifications of this.
[01:36:04.881 --> 01:36:06.281]  Inflation is coming.
[01:36:06.482 --> 01:36:09.623]  Tax revenues are going to come down, income streams for the government.
[01:36:09.944 --> 01:36:17.888]  They're going to be forced to print money, which is why I believe that Jerome Powell at the Fed did not lower interest rates.
[01:36:18.429 --> 01:36:19.569]  He kept them steady.
[01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:22.771]  He just paused on it, promising that they're going to lower them.
[01:36:23.071 --> 01:36:25.673]  That promise is a lie, just like everything else that they do.
[01:36:25.933 --> 01:36:27.114]  Now, they might do it once.
[01:36:27.654 --> 01:36:38.900]  So they can say that, yeah, we told you we're going to lower rates, but I think as inflation persists, the only policy outcome is to stop printing money, which they're not going to do, or raise interest rates to slow down that inflation.
[01:36:39.361 --> 01:36:40.281]  That's what's coming.
[01:36:40.721 --> 01:36:44.964]  That's what's going to impact Americans living at the margin more than anything.
[01:36:45.064 --> 01:36:47.585]  And if you wanted to help people, you'd have a cheap energy policy.
[01:36:51.554 --> 01:36:51.774]  Yes.
[01:36:52.695 --> 01:36:54.637]  So this is the world that we're living in.
[01:36:54.657 --> 01:36:55.777]  I am so excited to do a deep dive.
[01:36:55.797 --> 01:36:57.138]  By the way, you come on though, talk about it.
[01:36:57.158 --> 01:36:58.860]  We'll do a deep dive tomorrow, noon tomorrow.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.622]  Saturday, tomorrow, just 24 hours away.
[01:37:01.642 --> 01:37:03.263]  But you never plug your company.
[01:37:03.283 --> 01:37:04.304]  We're getting great reviews.
[01:37:04.324 --> 01:37:05.685]  You already have five stars online.
[01:37:06.165 --> 01:37:11.089]  You've got gold and silver bullion ready to ship right now.
[01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:13.791]  You don't even get into the games, the news, the numismatic, all that.
[01:37:14.312 --> 01:37:15.513]  People, you're a great sponsor.
[01:37:15.533 --> 01:37:16.954]  People should get gold and silver from you.
[01:37:17.254 --> 01:37:18.034]  You're ready to ship it.
[01:37:18.055 --> 01:37:18.515]  How do they do it?
[01:37:19.724 --> 01:37:30.828]  Yeah, just go to kepm.com forward slash gold and there's a little form that they can fill out and say, hey, I want to talk to Kirk or his team and get this all squared away, right?
[01:37:30.868 --> 01:37:41.231]  We want to listen to you, hear your dreams, hear your fears, hear what concerns you and map out a strategy for success moving forward using tangible assets to protect, preserve, grow and thrive.
[01:37:41.672 --> 01:37:47.814]   Or you can call 720-605-3900 and just say Alex sent you, right?
[01:37:47.854 --> 01:38:00.499]   Because here's where we need to strategically and proactively take advantage of these stupid government trends and policies to make them In our advantage, right?
[01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:03.862]  We can take advantage of these things rather than them taking advantage of us.
[01:38:04.182 --> 01:38:16.013]  So call us at that number 720-605-3900 or go to KEPM.com forward slash gold and we're talking about checking accounts, savings accounts, brokerage accounts, IRAs.
[01:38:16.513 --> 01:38:22.439]  We can actually allocate into physical metals with all of those and we can do it pretty quickly for you.
[01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:30.235]  Well, the time is grow a garden, get gold, get silver, learn how to shoot a gun, because this son of a bitch is going down.
[01:38:30.635 --> 01:38:32.856]  And I look at the craziness of the left.
[01:38:33.457 --> 01:38:37.419]  In Europe, the farmers are tearing up the roads, burning stuff down because they've outlawed them.
[01:38:37.619 --> 01:38:38.760]  They're saying you're shut down.
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.361]  They're cutting the food off.
[01:38:40.721 --> 01:38:45.624]  They believe we'll be so dumb, Klaus Schwab said, when everybody gets angry, they'll accept the new communist model.
[01:38:45.744 --> 01:38:47.125]  No, no, we're not.
[01:38:47.405 --> 01:38:50.047]  We know they're doing it, but they're still going ahead with it.
[01:38:52.301 --> 01:38:55.565]  I mean, these globalist policies, Alex, are insane.
[01:38:56.105 --> 01:38:58.968]  And it has nothing to do with fixing the system.
[01:38:59.029 --> 01:39:01.071]  It has everything to do with people control.
[01:39:01.451 --> 01:39:08.779]  When you can stop what people are earning, what they spend their money on based on your ideology, what you eat, where you travel, what kind of health you have.
[01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:15.479]   which is why the supplements that you have are so important because they're pushing vaccines down our throat.
[01:39:15.479 --> 01:39:19.878]   I mean, this is all about people control, which your listeners know that.
[01:39:19.878 --> 01:39:24.118]   You talk about this all the time, but all of those policies have severe
[01:39:24.118 --> 01:39:26.478]  economic ramifications, which is the one that I--
[01:39:26.478 --> 01:39:27.318]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:39:27.318 --> 01:39:29.879]   I'm gonna give you the floor here, 'cause you're gonna fly out tonight from Denver.
[01:39:29.879 --> 01:39:30.719]  You'll be here tomorrow.
[01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:32.839]  We're gonna do a two-hour at least live show.
[01:39:32.839 --> 01:39:35.699]   Then I got Gab McGinnis here for an interview we're doing and a bunch of stuff.
[01:39:35.699 --> 01:39:39.719]   Then I'll air that Saturday interview sometime next week on the main show.
[01:39:39.719 --> 01:39:44.399]   But just spend a few minutes on, when you talk to your wife, you talk to your children,
[01:39:44.399 --> 01:39:46.039]  we can see we're down to the end game here.
[01:39:46.039 --> 01:39:48.118]  I mean, and the globalists have been exposed.
[01:39:48.118 --> 01:39:49.179]  They're still crazy.
[01:39:49.179 --> 01:39:52.079]   What do you expect in the next 10 months out of this election?
[01:39:52.079 --> 01:40:01.378]   Well, I expect chaos, mayhem, economic fallout from all of these policies.
[01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:13.846]  But see, during times of economic fallout, when people can't feed their kids, when they can't afford to pay their rent or their mortgage, when food prices are going through the roof, gas prices are going through the roof, here's the human nature.
[01:40:14.367 --> 01:40:21.992]  People tend to give up their freedoms in time of crisis in exchange for perceived security or peace, right?
[01:40:22.412 --> 01:40:29.295]   So I expect Because, look, the people in charge right now can't win on their own merits.
[01:40:29.335 --> 01:40:31.035]  They've destroyed the economy.
[01:40:31.075 --> 01:40:32.816]  They've destroyed society in America.
[01:40:32.916 --> 01:40:37.217]  But if you destroy it bad enough, you might get votes, right?
[01:40:37.257 --> 01:40:39.017]  Because people will want you to try to fix it.
[01:40:39.057 --> 01:40:40.378]  They're going to try to trick us.
[01:40:41.138 --> 01:40:43.660]  Into thinking that they have a solution.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:47.362]  The solution is going to come through central bank digital currency and things like that.
[01:40:47.942 --> 01:40:51.164]  This is awful intrusion on our bank accounts.
[01:40:51.284 --> 01:40:52.945]  It's intrusion on our way of life.
[01:40:53.385 --> 01:40:59.849]  The ability to cut you off from buying or selling if they don't like what you're buying or selling or how you spend your money.
[01:41:00.369 --> 01:41:04.992]  See, this is all going to manifest itself in my expectation.
[01:41:05.012 --> 01:41:06.433]  You know, I'm not God.
[01:41:06.453 --> 01:41:07.854]  I don't control the markets.
[01:41:08.154 --> 01:41:16.634]   My expectation is this does play itself out before the election this year, because you have to have some kind of a
[01:41:16.634 --> 01:41:23.154]   crisis to get momentum to get people to try to vote for you because you come up with a proposed solution.
[01:41:23.154 --> 01:41:32.154]  Okay, so, so with that, what do we do?
[01:41:32.558 --> 01:41:41.960]  I mean, if you have a bank account that's, I've got this, so I just read this article, we're going to talk about this tomorrow.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:45.221]  Regional banks are starting to crash again.
[01:41:45.241 --> 01:41:48.021]  I think we're going to have regional bank failures 2.0.
[01:41:49.401 --> 01:41:50.662]  Banks are undercapitalized.
[01:41:50.702 --> 01:41:55.943]  I mean, listen to this list of bank stocks that just got shellacked yesterday alone.
[01:41:56.443 --> 01:42:11.382]  So, regional banks like, here let me read this, Western Alliance Bank Corp., Zions Bank, Comerica, Webster Financial, Citizens Financial, Regions, South State, Prosperity Bank Share, Schwab of all things.
[01:42:12.063 --> 01:42:17.589]  Pack West, Huntington Bank shares, all their stocks are just being trashed, just going to the pit.
[01:42:17.929 --> 01:42:20.952]  That's the first sign of bank failures coming.
[01:42:21.453 --> 01:42:30.081]  Look what happened to the markets when Silicon Valley, Signature Bank, Silvergate, Credit Suisse and Western, I mean, we had grief.
[01:42:30.662 --> 01:42:33.284]  I mean, I think what we're going to see are bank failures.
[01:42:33.645 --> 01:42:36.927]   What's going to impact people's No, I agree with that.
[01:42:36.947 --> 01:42:41.768]  How is that going to go for the New World Order, though, when they want to create the crisis as opposed to the savior?
[01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:44.307]  safest asset that they have.
[01:42:44.307 --> 01:42:48.068]   So I think you're gonna see a lot of upheaval and people starting to operate out of fear.
[01:42:48.068 --> 01:42:53.347]   How's that gonna go for the New World Order though, when they want to create the crisis
[01:42:53.347 --> 01:42:58.347]   opposed to the savior, if they are exposed as the bad guys, how does that go for them?
[01:42:58.347 --> 01:43:01.867]   Well, they're pretending that they're not the bad guys, Alex.
[01:43:02.163 --> 01:43:03.725]  So what are they going to do when banks fail?
[01:43:03.765 --> 01:43:12.374]  It's like we've got a new solution to bring in to actually replace all these failing banks based on fiat-based money creation.
[01:43:12.414 --> 01:43:15.437]  We've got digital money creation, 365 days a year, 24-7 instant money transfer.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:26.126]  We can find the money launderers, we can find the drug traffickers, the human traffickers, all of this stuff, and people are going to buy into that baloney.
[01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:28.908]  I mean, that's... I would love for all of that stuff to go away.
[01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:29.729]  All of us would.
[01:43:30.069 --> 01:43:33.332]  But the flip side of that coin is they can also monitor you.
[01:43:33.692 --> 01:43:37.755]  What church you give to, what church you donate to, what political party, right?
[01:43:38.136 --> 01:43:39.357]  How you spend your money.
[01:43:39.397 --> 01:43:43.520]  Do you spend money on gas or on meat or whatever, right?
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.922]   Everything that they don't want They are going to know.
[01:43:45.962 --> 01:43:47.803]  It's going to be big brother in your bank account.
[01:43:47.863 --> 01:43:53.227]  So when you have a crisis like this, you know, what did Rahm Emanuel say once?
[01:43:53.708 --> 01:43:55.749]  Never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
[01:43:56.090 --> 01:44:01.254]  So they're going to use this to their advantage to bring in something that they're going to propose a solution for.
[01:44:01.754 --> 01:44:03.796]  And they're the ones that are creating this.
[01:44:03.896 --> 01:44:05.857]  These are the banksters, right?
[01:44:05.917 --> 01:44:07.939]  That they're creating the new system.
[01:44:08.219 --> 01:44:10.421]  They're just pretending that they're not.
[01:44:11.081 --> 01:44:13.002]  Right, and don't take my word for it.
[01:44:13.382 --> 01:44:21.285]  Listen to the words and the policies of the World Economic Forum, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Fed, the European Central Bank.
[01:44:21.786 --> 01:44:27.188]  All of them, in concert, saying central bank digital currency is coming.
[01:44:27.548 --> 01:44:28.748]  And you know what they're afraid of?
[01:44:29.309 --> 01:44:30.249]  They're afraid of Trump.
[01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:33.470]  You know, Christine Lagarde at the European Union.
[01:44:33.690 --> 01:44:36.272]  Because he doesn't want to loot the American people.
[01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:36.772]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:37.591 --> 01:44:44.419]  Yeah, they don't want Trump in because he's going to expose the globalist plan and they think that it's going to be lights out, right?
[01:44:44.899 --> 01:44:49.064]  So what they want is elimination of paper currency.
[01:44:49.104 --> 01:44:51.126]  They want the elimination of their own system.
[01:44:53.729 --> 01:44:56.534]  I knew who you were years ago, and I was looking for a good gold sponsor.
[01:44:56.554 --> 01:44:57.435]  You never plug yourself.
[01:44:58.116 --> 01:44:59.759]  And then I'm like, hey, reach out.
[01:44:59.779 --> 01:45:00.780]  Yeah, I want to be a sponsor.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.041]  Great.
[01:45:01.321 --> 01:45:02.202]  And the listeners love you.
[01:45:02.243 --> 01:45:03.004]  You're so smart.
[01:45:03.304 --> 01:45:04.085]  You're so dead on.
[01:45:04.105 --> 01:45:06.469]  But people do need to get basic gold and silver.
[01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:08.432]  They need to at least stick their toe in the ocean.
[01:45:09.053 --> 01:45:09.513]  And do it.
[01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:16.456]  They need to go to your website, K-E-P-M, K-E-P-M.com forward slash gold.
[01:45:16.876 --> 01:45:18.937]  K-E-P-M.com forward slash gold.
[01:45:18.957 --> 01:45:24.400]  That's K-E-P-M.com forward slash gold.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.740]  Or call 720-605-3900.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.162]  They need to talk to you folks and start getting gold and silver bullion now.
[01:45:30.202 --> 01:45:33.451]   But regardless, We're in for an insane time.
[01:45:33.972 --> 01:45:34.812]  Everybody knows it.
[01:45:35.233 --> 01:45:36.534]  We tried to stop the New World Order.
[01:45:36.634 --> 01:45:37.295]  It's here now.
[01:45:38.616 --> 01:45:41.699]  Just a minute or so before we got a break, and I got my next guest coming on.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:47.844]  Former Green Beret, Defense Intelligence Agency operative, lawyer.
[01:45:48.264 --> 01:45:50.747]  Ivan Reikland's got so much intel for us next hour.
[01:45:51.147 --> 01:45:55.111]  But just in closing, you're a parent, you're a father, you're a patriot.
[01:45:56.091 --> 01:45:57.533]  People need to get ready is what I think you're saying.
[01:45:59.212 --> 01:46:14.079]  They do need to get ready because some of the stuff we're going to be talking about tomorrow, state pensions are facing insolvency, people's retirements facing insolvency, not all gold and silver created equal, right?
[01:46:14.119 --> 01:46:15.640]  You're hearing ads everywhere.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.301]  Don't go into rare stuff.
[01:46:17.321 --> 01:46:20.222]  Don't go into those coins that you're never going to recover from those premiums.
[01:46:20.242 --> 01:46:21.223]  I've been doing this for decades.
[01:46:21.343 --> 01:46:25.587]  When I was looking for somebody that has good ratings and just sells bullion, that's the sure bet.
[01:46:26.007 --> 01:46:28.269]  And you give them a little charge to pay for it and run your operation.
[01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:29.530]  I love you, man.
[01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:34.915]  I'm telling you, people, if you want gold and silver, go to KEPM.com for less gold.
[01:46:35.276 --> 01:46:38.579]  They keep us on air and they're straight up and they've got it and they're ready to ship it.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:41.121]  Well, thanks for that.
[01:46:41.221 --> 01:46:43.123]  I mean, we love doing what we do.
[01:46:43.223 --> 01:46:44.484]  We love helping people.
[01:46:45.259 --> 01:46:45.619]  Right?
[01:46:45.679 --> 01:46:48.100]  The philosophy of our firm is people over profit.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:51.222]  I wish that were the case for every firm in the industry, right?
[01:46:51.282 --> 01:46:54.103]  But most companies are profit over people.
[01:46:54.203 --> 01:46:55.304]  They make as much as you can.
[01:46:55.324 --> 01:46:59.466]  I've had them as sponsors and I drop them because I go, I want you to only sell them bullion.
[01:46:59.566 --> 01:47:01.427]  And day one they sell them something numismatic.
[01:47:01.947 --> 01:47:02.687]  And I'm just like, done.
[01:47:03.928 --> 01:47:06.650]  Yeah, when you focus on people, Alex, profit will come.
[01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:09.131]  If you ever start focusing on profit, people will leave.
[01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:11.492]  Well, it's like Tony Montana at the end of Scarface.
[01:47:11.512 --> 01:47:12.753]  Don't want to blow the kids up in the car.
[01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.854]  He goes, hey man, I don't need that in my life.
[01:47:15.275 --> 01:47:16.315]  I need a straight shoot.
[01:47:16.495 --> 01:47:17.416]  I need the good mojo.
[01:47:17.716 --> 01:47:19.077]  Kirk Elliott, see you in the studio tomorrow.
[01:47:19.117 --> 01:47:19.537]  Love you, brother.
[01:47:20.398 --> 01:47:20.938]  See you, love you too.
[01:47:20.958 --> 01:47:21.118]  Bye.
[01:47:21.478 --> 01:47:21.999]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:22.019 --> 01:47:22.399]  Stay with us.
[01:47:22.919 --> 01:47:24.340]  Benny Botham's died.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:31.361]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[01:47:32.081 --> 01:47:41.823]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[01:47:42.263 --> 01:47:48.144]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[01:47:48.564 --> 01:47:54.765]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[01:47:55.811 --> 01:48:09.855]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[01:48:10.355 --> 01:48:14.096]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[01:48:14.436 --> 01:48:27.933]   Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com I both talked to Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand privately about the nature of Satan.
[01:48:29.235 --> 01:48:33.199]  Once you admit Satan's real and that God's really a power over the enemy.
[01:48:33.699 --> 01:48:40.726]  Here's a short clip from Tucker Carlson's latest interview and then we'll come back with breaking news and then Ivan Reikland's in studio.
[01:48:40.746 --> 01:48:41.127]  Stay with us.
[01:48:42.648 --> 01:48:45.391]  So the things that the people in charge hate include nature.
[01:48:45.411 --> 01:48:46.092]  Yes.
[01:48:46.612 --> 01:48:50.576]  And the class of people who are most useful to your nation.
[01:48:50.596 --> 01:48:51.297]  You described them.
[01:48:51.917 --> 01:48:54.440]  Cops, firemen, teachers, nurses.
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.242]  All of them were crushed during COVID, by the way.
[01:48:56.482 --> 01:48:57.063]  Yes.
[01:48:57.283 --> 01:48:57.723]  And farmers.
[01:48:58.584 --> 01:49:01.686]  And it's indisputable that if you don't have those people, you don't have a society.
[01:49:02.206 --> 01:49:06.909]  You could get rid of every think tank and every sociology department and every liberal arts university and probably be okay.
[01:49:07.209 --> 01:49:08.530]  You get rid of your farmers, you starve to death.
[01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:17.215]  So it's not obvious why the leadership of a country would hate the very people they need most and hate the most beautiful and valuable thing they have, which is nature.
[01:49:17.675 --> 01:49:18.636]  Why do they hate those things?
[01:49:21.343 --> 01:49:50.444]  It terrifies me to contemplate, Tucker, that people like Alex Jones and, in our country, David Icke, who, aside from some views that are impossible to corroborate around quite occultist and, shall we call them, marginal ideas, difficult to corroborate ideas, when it comes to the subject of globalisation and the increasing authoritarianisation of our planet, appear to have been ahead of the curve.
[01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:59.972]  You can see them 20, 30 years ago saying the empowerment of NATO, the empowerment of World Banks and the WHO, that this is extraordinary.
[01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:19.349]   And it seems to me that the disempowerment of ordinary people, the condemnation, the demoralization of the public, To create people that just are weary and broken and if not enslaved then so dependent it amounts to a form of slavery.
[01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:21.391]  Cannot be inadvertent.
[01:50:22.092 --> 01:50:27.857]  It seems to be a denial of something fundamental that I, in my language, I would call spirit.
[01:50:28.658 --> 01:50:30.400]  The right to be who you are.
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:35.744]  That there isn't something fundamentally ugly or wrong with you, that you are allowed to be who you are.
[01:50:35.984 --> 01:50:43.889]  And I see that as a universal principle that will be applied all the way from the left to the right across various ways that people claim their individual identity now.
[01:50:44.590 --> 01:51:09.234]   It seems to me that yes, that if you start to attack those pivotal infrastructural roles, I was struck when speaking to some of the people that you work with, Man, you know, there's been a cop for 26 years in New Jersey, 35 years in the security services, but these people that give their lives for a country, so to tell those people that your country doesn't mean anything or to alter the meaning of what a nation is or alter what your contribution has been,
[01:51:09.674 --> 01:51:13.536]  It seems to be about a kind of disorientation, and it's difficult actually sometimes.
[01:51:13.556 --> 01:51:21.901]  The reason I mentioned at the beginning of this rather corroming answer, figures that are broadly condemned as conspiracy theorists, but then aren't we all these days?
[01:51:22.741 --> 01:51:26.043]  The reason I mention them is because they talk specifically about ideas...
[01:51:26.443 --> 01:51:29.646]  To do with spirituality, morality and ethics.
[01:51:30.106 --> 01:51:37.573]  And it's hard for someone like me to consider that the goals of this global establishment are anything other than power, finance, dominion.
[01:51:37.893 --> 01:51:49.384]  But when you talk about this loathing of nature, whether that's human nature or botany or the great expanse, it's difficult to think that there isn't something dark at its core.
[01:51:51.301 --> 01:51:53.502]  Because there's no rational explanation for that.
[01:51:54.083 --> 01:51:56.884]  How could you want to despoil nature?
[01:51:57.164 --> 01:51:58.905]  How could you hate human nature?
[01:51:58.925 --> 01:52:01.127]  How could you want to hurt people?
[01:52:01.587 --> 01:52:04.489]  Those are not rational responses to anything.
[01:52:04.529 --> 01:52:09.612]   I mean, clearly, What we're watching are the fruits of spiritual war.
[01:52:10.273 --> 01:52:11.874]  If you can give a better explanation, let me know.
[01:52:12.014 --> 01:52:22.022]  Certainly the solution seems to me to be spiritual, and even when they're talking about ecology and evoking words like Gaia, like the spirit of the planet, it seems oddly utilitarian.
[01:52:22.342 --> 01:52:23.783]  The Earth is a resource.
[01:52:23.983 --> 01:52:34.392]  Even when claiming to care about the types of energy industry that might be most beneficial and those which might not be as beneficial, I don't see reverence.
[01:52:34.992 --> 01:52:38.695]  I don't see an acknowledgment of the sacredness of the Earth.
[01:52:39.756 --> 01:52:41.277]  The Earth is not a resource.
[01:52:41.677 --> 01:52:56.427]   It's not, you know, obviously the left and right are classically almost at this point divided around the subject of climate change, and what I feel is who Well, who among us ought not love our planet and behave respectfully and reverentially and lovingly to our planet?
[01:52:56.667 --> 01:52:59.049]  And how is that going to happen if no one has a relationship with it?
[01:52:59.069 --> 01:53:04.293]  I think like 90% of, in my country, 90% of the land is inaccessible to most people.
[01:53:04.313 --> 01:53:10.257]  90% of the land is privately owned, like land that used to be commonly held is now all privately owned.
[01:53:10.457 --> 01:53:17.802]  There has been successive law after successive law that has moved power and control and the land and nature herself into the hands of an elite.
[01:53:18.062 --> 01:53:29.930]   And is this, I suppose, even where it would When I was a child, they told me the new war was coming.
[01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:33.412]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:53:33.692 --> 01:53:34.753]  They told me to prepare.
[01:53:34.873 --> 01:53:38.496]  Alex Jones told me to get the people ready.
[01:53:38.636 --> 01:53:39.056]  And I did.
[01:53:41.978 --> 01:53:49.087]   And now, in the year 2054, We face the globalist onslaught.
[01:53:49.768 --> 01:53:51.849]  We're not hypothetical anymore.
[01:53:52.230 --> 01:53:54.071]  We're not in the enemy's beta test.
[01:53:54.731 --> 01:53:56.052]  We are in the fulcrum.
[01:53:58.094 --> 01:53:58.874]  We are in the battle.
[01:53:59.895 --> 01:54:02.077]  We are fighting for our lives.
[01:54:02.357 --> 01:54:10.023]  And I know that if you'll simply admit that to yourself, we will win.
[01:54:11.125 --> 01:54:21.989]  You are so smart, so powerful, and I'm waiting for you to join us.
[01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:38.456]  All right, so that said, I've got all these articles about Pino Pesca.
[01:54:40.862 --> 01:54:43.303]  Because their whole program, their ESGs are falling apart.
[01:54:43.763 --> 01:54:45.344]  Their whole new world order is going down.
[01:54:46.684 --> 01:54:48.205]  We are wrecking the living hell out of them.
[01:54:48.585 --> 01:54:50.045]  But the enemy is going to hit back.
[01:54:50.145 --> 01:54:54.207]  So just because we're having some victories, let's not start celebrating yet.
[01:54:55.067 --> 01:54:59.349]  John Pito Esca to replace Kerry as top climate diplomat.
[01:54:59.669 --> 01:55:05.731]  So Kerry is running around trying to cut our gas powered stoves off and our cars off and starve the living hell out of us.
[01:55:06.672 --> 01:55:10.328]   And now they're going to put this Man, read the WikiLeaks, man.
[01:55:10.848 --> 01:55:14.610]  We're gonna have kids ready for you in upstate New York in a hot tub.
[01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:15.991]  They're 7, 9, and 10.
[01:55:16.231 --> 01:55:17.492]  They're gonna service you, sir.
[01:55:17.512 --> 01:55:20.053]  I mean, that's screwing kids, folks.
[01:55:20.714 --> 01:55:22.155]  That son of a bitch screws kids.
[01:55:23.315 --> 01:55:24.296]  He's caught red-handed.
[01:55:26.325 --> 01:55:29.770]  Julian Assange is in solitary confinement and tortured to death to bring us this information.
[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:34.437]  It's like in Star Wars when she says, many Ba'athas have died to bring us this information.
[01:55:34.757 --> 01:55:35.558]  That's a movie.
[01:55:36.039 --> 01:55:37.041]  This is a real world.
[01:55:37.481 --> 01:55:41.928]  Many people have been put in prison and killed to bring us this information.
[01:55:42.188 --> 01:55:53.074]  And we just sit there kind of like, oh, the NSA talked to our people last night and said they're turning on the NSA spy grid and they're about to have white supremacist attack the border patrol.
[01:55:53.435 --> 01:55:54.976]  Oh, that's just Alex over there.
[01:55:54.996 --> 01:55:57.117]  You know, he's just saying that stuff.
[01:55:57.537 --> 01:55:58.418]  I didn't say that.
[01:55:58.498 --> 01:55:59.018]  It's true.
[01:56:00.659 --> 01:56:04.241]  You're being given the keys to their destruction.
[01:56:04.741 --> 01:56:05.382]  That's what we do.
[01:56:07.233 --> 01:56:09.054]  Because we're willing to do it, folks.
[01:56:09.494 --> 01:56:10.915]  And people go, why are you still alive?
[01:56:11.216 --> 01:56:13.237]  Because the devil ain't in charge, folks.
[01:56:13.657 --> 01:56:16.559]  We give him all the power he's got.
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.821]  How about we stop giving him the power?
[01:56:21.762 --> 01:56:27.446]  The new world order pulled me over today and stood me up against the wall and said, reject Jesus Christ.
[01:56:27.466 --> 01:56:28.527]  I'm gonna shoot in the back of the head.
[01:56:28.867 --> 01:56:31.169]  I'd say, thank God I'm about to get the hell out of this.
[01:56:31.529 --> 01:56:48.068]   And I'm not suicidal, I'm just saying, It's a big burden to fight these people, but it's a pleasurable one, but it's also like, just complete the mission, be a man, never stop, never give up, never bend, and it's like, oh, you're gonna kill me?
[01:56:48.088 --> 01:56:53.452]  I have, the things they've done to my family, and I don't bitch, I'm not a victim.
[01:56:54.412 --> 01:56:55.513]  The things they've done to me.
[01:56:57.735 --> 01:57:00.377]  It's like, oh God, you already hurt me so bad, what do you do next?
[01:57:02.042 --> 01:57:06.347]  And it's, that's the ecstasy of it is they've hurt me so bad.
[01:57:08.489 --> 01:57:10.489]  There's not much more they can do.
[01:57:10.489 --> 01:57:18.649]   The last thing I'm gonna do is get my hands around their neck.
[01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:24.149]   *snarl* *snarl*
[01:57:24.209 --> 01:57:25.610]  Because my full will is against them.
[01:57:25.630 --> 01:57:27.471]  They can feel it like a knife in their guts.
[01:57:28.112 --> 01:57:33.315]  My will is like a double-edged, foot-long dagger shoved right up their ass.
[01:57:33.936 --> 01:57:37.678]  And they can feel it, and they know it, and I'm gonna get them!
[01:57:41.781 --> 01:57:45.543]  I'm gonna get your ass if it's the last thing I do.
[01:57:47.324 --> 01:57:52.028]  You know, Captain Am got his leg cut off and broken up in that fictional book.
[01:57:52.836 --> 01:57:54.718]  And he hated that white whale went after it.
[01:57:55.098 --> 01:57:58.000]  Well, all that white whale did was take your leg off, man.
[01:57:58.341 --> 01:57:59.401]  I get it, you're pissed.
[01:58:00.442 --> 01:58:01.763]  But you took a lot more of my leg.
[01:58:01.783 --> 01:58:03.905]  You took a lot more.
[01:58:05.867 --> 01:58:07.868]  And I know you're going down.
[01:58:08.309 --> 01:58:09.590]  I can smell your death.
[01:58:10.150 --> 01:58:11.431]  I can feel it right now.
[01:58:12.492 --> 01:58:14.433]  And sure, I'd love to be around at the end of this.
[01:58:15.603 --> 01:58:17.644]  And sit around and piss on your graves.
[01:58:18.244 --> 01:58:19.405]  But that's not gonna happen.
[01:58:19.685 --> 01:58:20.825]  We all know what's gonna happen.
[01:58:21.185 --> 01:58:22.406]  We're gonna beat these people.
[01:58:23.346 --> 01:58:24.327]  And we're gonna get them.
[01:58:24.747 --> 01:58:26.047]  And we got them right now.
[01:58:26.467 --> 01:58:28.368]  They think they got us, we got them.
[01:58:28.788 --> 01:58:31.850]  They think they broke our will, we have broken their will.
[01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:34.711]  And I want you right now to know why they fear this broadcast.
[01:58:35.071 --> 01:58:38.152]  Because the Spirit of God is alive with us right now.
[01:58:38.572 --> 01:58:40.473]  We are dialed into God.
[01:58:40.573 --> 01:58:42.434]  We are eternal.
[01:58:42.494 --> 01:58:44.935]  We are eternal!
[01:58:47.406 --> 01:58:49.768]  And we will never submit to them!
[01:58:50.088 --> 01:58:51.930]  We will never bow!
[01:58:55.553 --> 01:58:56.874]  I got hundreds of articles right here.
[01:58:57.434 --> 01:58:57.755]  Hundreds.
[01:58:58.215 --> 01:58:59.956]  I got clips that are so horrible.
[01:58:59.976 --> 01:59:05.541]  My only failure is I watch this stuff and I don't even want to put it on air.
[01:59:08.864 --> 01:59:09.504]  But you know what?
[01:59:10.605 --> 01:59:11.266]  It is what it is.
[01:59:12.247 --> 01:59:14.247]  Just look at this headline right here.
[01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:21.247]  Look at this headline right here.
[01:59:22.039 --> 01:59:22.959]  Because it says it all.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.561]  Look at this meme.
[01:59:30.361 --> 01:59:31.662]  If you're a radio listener, I'll describe it.
[01:59:31.842 --> 01:59:32.842]  It's a little sweet girl.
[01:59:33.502 --> 01:59:34.503]  Probably a four-year-old girl.
[01:59:35.603 --> 01:59:36.843]  You'd die for her, wouldn't you?
[01:59:36.863 --> 01:59:38.224]  There's no question you would.
[01:59:38.484 --> 01:59:39.664]  Because you got God on your side.
[01:59:39.924 --> 01:59:42.465]  If you don't look at her and are ready to die for her, you're dead already.
[01:59:43.445 --> 01:59:44.105]  Drive a car?
[01:59:44.586 --> 01:59:44.846]  No.
[01:59:45.686 --> 01:59:46.606]  She can't drive a car.
[01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:47.226]  She doesn't know how.
[01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:48.847]  We're going to protect her.
[01:59:50.336 --> 01:59:51.177]  Pick your bedtime.
[01:59:51.377 --> 01:59:52.318]  Little four-year-old boy?
[01:59:52.658 --> 01:59:52.878]  No.
[01:59:54.179 --> 01:59:56.481]  Drink a beer for a little six-year-old girl?
[01:59:56.781 --> 01:59:57.021]  No.
[01:59:58.563 --> 01:59:58.823]  Vote?
[01:59:59.143 --> 01:59:59.403]  No.
[02:00:00.284 --> 02:00:03.346]  Cut off your sexual organs and take hormones?
[02:00:03.366 --> 02:00:03.426]  Yes.
[02:00:05.672 --> 02:00:07.633]  Look how far we've slid.
[02:00:08.254 --> 02:00:22.343]  Look what we've become, and God's literally looking down on us, watching us, giving us the energy and the program to stop this, and saying, I want you on my side, but if you don't resist this, I'm going to cut you off.
[02:00:23.824 --> 02:00:24.324]  It's that simple.
[02:00:26.666 --> 02:00:36.311]   Can't drive a car, can't pick her on bedtime, can't drink a beer, can't vote, but you can sure as hell Cut your penis off!
[02:00:38.333 --> 02:00:40.595]  Does that not say everything in this video?
[02:00:40.975 --> 02:00:45.779]  You know, the same... I was literally sending this two days ago at like 6 a.m.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:46.920]  to the crew to air.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:47.521]  I never aired it.
[02:00:48.322 --> 02:00:57.270]  And like, as I'm sending the video off Twitter, off X, to the crew, Joe Rogan sends me the link and says, look how evil this is.
[02:00:58.029 --> 02:00:59.250]  I was like, wow, that's a zeitgeist.
[02:00:59.611 --> 02:01:00.191]  I never got to it.
[02:01:00.531 --> 02:01:01.613]  It's this mother.
[02:01:01.993 --> 02:01:02.433]  Look at her.
[02:01:02.754 --> 02:01:05.456]  It's this trendy mother with her 10-year-old daughter.
[02:01:05.777 --> 02:01:06.798]  And she cries and begs.
[02:01:06.818 --> 02:01:07.398]  She doesn't want it.
[02:01:07.639 --> 02:01:12.383]  And they inject her with pellets that are going to sterilize her for life and ruin her power.
[02:01:13.865 --> 02:01:16.708]  And this person does it because she wants to be trendy.
[02:01:19.851 --> 02:01:22.053]  Lady, you got God to deal with.
[02:01:26.718 --> 02:01:27.618]  But just look at them.
[02:01:28.058 --> 02:01:29.238]  It's their sacrament.
[02:01:29.739 --> 02:01:31.599]  I will bring to you, Molek, my daughter.
[02:01:31.619 --> 02:01:33.759]  I will destroy her fertility.
[02:01:33.839 --> 02:01:34.859]  I will bow to you.
[02:01:35.319 --> 02:01:36.940]  I will give you everything you want.
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.980]  Just give me your certification of approval.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.901]  And that is the mark of the beast.
[02:01:42.661 --> 02:01:43.801]  Look at the face of that mother.
[02:01:45.761 --> 02:01:47.181]  Look at the face of that mother right here.
[02:01:48.002 --> 02:01:49.882]  Her begging mommy, don't do it.
[02:01:50.222 --> 02:01:51.382]  We're taking your fertility.
[02:01:51.802 --> 02:01:52.962]  You're never going to have children.
[02:01:53.903 --> 02:01:55.403]  We're raping you beyond rape.
[02:01:56.434 --> 02:01:57.495]  And there's the mother right there.
[02:01:57.515 --> 02:01:57.975]  Look at the face.
[02:01:59.216 --> 02:02:00.337]  The satisfaction.
[02:02:00.397 --> 02:02:00.977]  Look at the overhead shot.
[02:02:00.997 --> 02:02:02.658]  Look at this shot.
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:05.260]  Right here.
[02:02:07.502 --> 02:02:08.262]  Look at that mother.
[02:02:08.362 --> 02:02:08.623]  Right here.
[02:02:08.983 --> 02:02:09.783]  Guys, overhead shot.
[02:02:10.504 --> 02:02:10.864]  Look at that.
[02:02:11.865 --> 02:02:12.786]  The pleasure.
[02:02:13.606 --> 02:02:15.568]  The pressing on the nerve of God.
[02:02:16.188 --> 02:02:17.449]  I've got my daughter here.
[02:02:17.769 --> 02:02:19.410]  We're about to sterilize her.
[02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:22.110]  And there ain't nothing you can do to stop it.
[02:02:22.110 --> 02:02:27.110]  [Groans]
[02:02:27.110 --> 02:02:29.110]  Yeah!
[02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:39.109]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:02:30.374 --> 02:02:31.915]  And look, look at this map.
[02:02:32.435 --> 02:02:36.337]  Before Obama, 2007, no gender transition clinics.
[02:02:37.117 --> 02:02:38.498]  And look at it after Obama.
[02:02:39.378 --> 02:02:40.899]  And the Pritzkers and all of them.
[02:02:42.199 --> 02:02:43.840]  Modern human sacrifice.
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.581]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[02:02:46.786 --> 02:02:47.526]  I'm gonna go to break.
[02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.427]  Ivan Reikland's about to take over.
[02:02:50.028 --> 02:03:00.593]  He'll be joining me in studio to talk about what's happening in Congress, what's happening with the border, and the New World Order, formerly the US Intelligence Agency, Green Beret, Patriot, straight ahead.
[02:03:01.234 --> 02:03:03.875]  Ivan Reikland, straight ahead.
[02:03:03.915 --> 02:03:06.236]  We'll be back in four short minutes.
[02:03:06.737 --> 02:03:09.378]  But whatever you do, don't share the links, don't tell people to tune in.
[02:03:09.738 --> 02:03:11.179]  We might actually win if you did that.
[02:03:11.399 --> 02:03:27.318]  No, just sit there and be murdered.
[02:03:27.494 --> 02:03:28.635]  Ivan, great to have you in the studio.
[02:03:28.955 --> 02:03:30.075]  And I guess you broke your leg.
[02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.077]  Yeah, fantastic to be here, Alex, as always.
[02:03:32.097 --> 02:03:32.557]  Yeah, I did.
[02:03:32.937 --> 02:03:34.458]  But that's not going to slow me down.
[02:03:34.658 --> 02:03:34.958]  You know what?
[02:03:35.038 --> 02:03:36.539]  I'm faster now that I'm in a wheelchair.
[02:03:36.839 --> 02:03:43.724]  Because when I'm squeaking through the halls of Congress, they're not going to be able to run from me, these octogenarian, just poisonous humans.
[02:03:44.964 --> 02:03:45.885]  So you were on a toboggan.
[02:03:45.905 --> 02:03:46.865]  You were going on a sled.
[02:03:48.126 --> 02:03:48.706]  So here's the story.
[02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:56.866]  After I went and confronted Hunter Biden in the hallway for asking him what kind of crack do you smoke, Mr. Biden, he sent his goons after me.
[02:03:56.947 --> 02:03:58.408]  Six of them are still in the hospital.
[02:03:58.528 --> 02:04:02.530]  One I let go to let them know that, guess what, I'm coming for all of you.
[02:04:02.891 --> 02:04:06.333]  And I got that, remember that deep state target list that I introduced you to last time I was on the show?
[02:04:06.833 --> 02:04:09.955]  I got a quick video that goes into a little bit more detail if you want to play that.
[02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:10.536]  Do they have that?
[02:04:10.736 --> 02:04:11.136]  Yeah, they do.
[02:04:11.657 --> 02:04:12.537]  Guys, you have his video?
[02:04:13.037 --> 02:04:14.639]  It's two minutes and 31 seconds.
[02:04:14.979 --> 02:04:15.479]  Well, let's roll it.
[02:04:15.319 --> 02:04:17.319]  Here it is. Ha ha!
[02:04:17.319 --> 02:04:39.319]  [Music]
[02:04:39.319 --> 02:04:41.319]  I'll talk it through then for the radio.
[02:04:40.925 --> 02:04:42.106]  Yeah, you got the receipts.
[02:04:42.826 --> 02:04:56.438]  Alright, right now basically what we're looking at here is a list of video with the snapshots of the Twitter accounts of our Deep State target list where we're going to go after every single digital piece of evidence and residue that they left on the internet.
[02:04:56.458 --> 02:04:57.419]  This is like one of those hard decks.
[02:04:57.839 --> 02:05:00.182]  Yep, to showcase their seditious conspiracy.
[02:05:00.602 --> 02:05:03.345]  There's the treason category, there's the sedition category.
[02:05:03.765 --> 02:05:06.929]  Again, those that unmask Flynn, the 39 of them that have Twitter accounts.
[02:05:07.269 --> 02:05:11.714]  The 51 that provided cover for the Biden criminal syndicate laptop, their Twitter accounts.
[02:05:13.626 --> 02:05:15.626]  It wasn't the IRS.
[02:05:15.626 --> 02:05:24.145]   The public to read, see and hear as we piece together the seditious, conspiratorial actions
[02:05:24.145 --> 02:05:28.905]  that you committed over the course of the last eight years.
[02:05:28.905 --> 02:05:30.266]  And it's going to be glorious.
[02:05:30.266 --> 02:05:32.145]  Right.
[02:05:33.125 --> 02:05:34.947]  By the way, people say, oh, what does this do?
[02:05:35.368 --> 02:05:42.377]  When I was talking to Trump a lot and just saying, hey, Fiona Hill, hey, General McMasterson, they were flipping out in the news.
[02:05:42.517 --> 02:05:44.840]  And I got the CIA literally following me around harassing me.
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:46.682]  They are so scared of intel.
[02:05:47.043 --> 02:05:47.203]  Yeah.
[02:05:48.035 --> 02:05:51.037]  I mean, all this is is publicly available, well, not publicly available information.
[02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:52.458]  You don't need to FOIA this.
[02:05:53.059 --> 02:06:08.530]  All you need to do is say, hey, Elon Musk, change your rules of service, right, terms of service, to say, you know, in the public interest, in the interest of transparency, why don't we just take a look and see whether or not, remember what they did with, he looked at the logs, right, for you?
[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:09.010]  Yeah.
[02:06:09.171 --> 02:06:14.214]  And it was clear that, what's that, Oliver Darcy was the one that basically... It was all, it was Democratic Party.
[02:06:14.595 --> 02:06:15.816]  From Twitter, from X.
[02:06:16.576 --> 02:06:20.477]  Well, let's take a look at their direct messages, all the people that I have listed here in this video.
[02:06:21.238 --> 02:06:25.659]  And we're going to find out for sure, I would say beyond any shadow of a doubt... Oh, your mouth is God's ears.
[02:06:25.719 --> 02:06:28.140]  Explain why this is so important.
[02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:46.771]   If Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi join forces with us to go ahead and look at the direct messages of all these actors right now, We're going to be able to showcase beyond any doubt that they conducted a seditious conspiratorial coup starting in 2016 as soon as Mike Pence was foisted on Donald Trump to be his VP pick.
[02:06:47.311 --> 02:06:51.695]  And Crossfire Hurricane started illegally by defrauding the FISA court by spying on Carter.
[02:06:51.715 --> 02:06:53.596]  He was the main agent the whole time.
[02:06:53.776 --> 02:06:54.076]  What's that?
[02:06:54.476 --> 02:06:55.777]  Mike Pence was the agent the whole time.
[02:06:56.338 --> 02:06:56.918]  I think so.
[02:06:57.639 --> 02:07:03.123]  So we'll get back to that, but just looking at the American battle space right now, what do you make of it?
[02:07:03.854 --> 02:07:08.555]  So right now, I mean, like you said in the previous segment, we got them on the ropes, right?
[02:07:08.695 --> 02:07:11.776]  They're obviously going to fight back, they're going to escalate against us, but guess what?
[02:07:12.136 --> 02:07:15.257]  We're going to be able to escalate in a- We're not going to stop.
[02:07:15.597 --> 02:07:16.337]  Right, we're not going to stop.
[02:07:16.357 --> 02:07:18.017]  Because now we know the game.
[02:07:18.037 --> 02:07:28.179]  We have a massively more powerful First Amendment now that you're back on X, now that Tucker is- the view count on his content is 10X anything coming.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.720]  He's bigger than Joe Rogan now.
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:30.320]  Yeah, 50 million a day.
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:32.841]  He's easily bigger than Joe Rogan at this point.
[02:07:33.182 --> 02:07:34.322]  So now we have a First Amendment.
[02:07:34.342 --> 02:07:36.163]  We have all these other infrastructures in play.
[02:07:36.423 --> 02:07:36.664]  Truth.
[02:07:36.784 --> 02:07:38.585]  Every top person is anti-globalist.
[02:07:39.325 --> 02:07:39.765]  Absolutely.
[02:07:39.946 --> 02:07:40.706]  Yeah.
[02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.628]  Well, top people, Elon Musk, you, Joe Rogan.
[02:07:43.728 --> 02:07:46.329]  Well, Joe Rogan's kind of slow rolling, I think, to our side.
[02:07:46.349 --> 02:07:47.050]  He's joining us, yeah.
[02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:49.351]  And then we have all the other players, right?
[02:07:49.951 --> 02:07:50.672]  Owen's back.
[02:07:51.312 --> 02:07:52.333]  He's out of jail.
[02:07:52.353 --> 02:07:53.233]  So what are they going to do, though?
[02:07:53.253 --> 02:07:53.914]  They're not going to give up.
[02:07:56.693 --> 02:08:02.697]  The easiest thing for them to do, I think, is to shut down the internet and then move forward from there, right?
[02:08:02.998 --> 02:08:03.938]  So a cyber attack?
[02:08:04.178 --> 02:08:04.379]  Yeah.
[02:08:04.939 --> 02:08:06.080]  And they've been kind of preempting that.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.181]  They're talking about, like you talked about, the Civil War.
[02:08:08.602 --> 02:08:11.704]  But the problem is that we've already realized what they're willing to do.
[02:08:11.784 --> 02:08:13.405]  They're willing to go violent against us.
[02:08:13.425 --> 02:08:15.166]  They're willing to... I got a shirt on today.
[02:08:15.747 --> 02:08:21.011]  They're willing to go ahead and murder folks like Air Force veteran Ashley Babbitt, right?
[02:08:21.451 --> 02:08:22.372]  On the Capitol grounds.
[02:08:22.892 --> 02:08:25.474]  They're willing to murder... On the back of my shirt here is Roseanne Boylan.
[02:08:25.954 --> 02:08:30.777]  And they're using other means and mechanisms such as the clout shot, the bioweapon, etc.
[02:08:31.358 --> 02:08:32.959]  And what's happening right now at the border?
[02:08:33.239 --> 02:08:34.640]  They're probably going to try to instigate, right?
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:39.023]  They have, I call them at this point, the domestic terrorist organization known as the Democrat Party.
[02:08:39.503 --> 02:08:49.250]  The county GOP in Maverick County, Texas is about to deploy personnel to conduct a, they call it a protest, but who knows how out of hand it's going to get.
[02:08:49.590 --> 02:08:53.052]  And they're there to confront the National Guard to obstruct justice.
[02:08:53.172 --> 02:08:56.354]   The National Guard there is to protect our border Explain that.
[02:08:56.374 --> 02:08:57.535]  They're manipulating groups.
[02:08:58.116 --> 02:08:58.296]  Right.
[02:08:58.556 --> 02:09:15.227]  So I don't know how many people are going to show up, but I'm reading here in a report just 19 hours ago, Eagle Pass, and it says here that the leader of the Maverick County Democrat Party is going to try to stage a protest and it's going to get in the way of the National Guard.
[02:09:15.387 --> 02:09:21.111]  And that's from not only this, but also a good source within the National Guard that we received earlier today.
[02:09:21.911 --> 02:09:27.553]   And again, We, the convoy that I was a part of, I was there at the kickoff in Virginia Beach earlier this week on Monday.
[02:09:27.974 --> 02:09:31.575]  And because of my bum leg, I wasn't able to travel with them the entire period.
[02:09:31.615 --> 02:09:36.916]  I flew down yesterday, linked up with them yesterday at the rally last night.
[02:09:36.936 --> 02:09:38.757]  Ted Nugent, everybody there.
[02:09:39.137 --> 02:09:40.537]  Why weren't you there, Alex?
[02:09:40.957 --> 02:09:41.618]  I was on air.
[02:09:42.018 --> 02:09:43.178]  Okay, you're always on air.
[02:09:43.458 --> 02:09:44.299]  Reaching millions of people.
[02:09:44.319 --> 02:09:44.859]  Ted Nugent.
[02:09:45.159 --> 02:09:47.079]  We had Sarah Palin show up.
[02:09:47.439 --> 02:09:50.620]  We had, obviously, the local crew, Doc Chambers and Ann Baderstie.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.821]  No, I'm a loser, right?
[02:09:54.433 --> 02:09:55.717]  Sauron stays in the tower.
[02:09:55.737 --> 02:09:58.006]  I don't know, maybe you were up there.
[02:09:58.026 --> 02:09:59.351]  Nah, I need to go more.
[02:10:01.454 --> 02:10:04.717]  No, we had quite a few people up there and Michael Yan was there.
[02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:09.560]  Some of the big players that now, yesterday Tucker just had a with uh... what's his name?
[02:10:09.901 --> 02:10:11.342]  Brett Weinstein.
[02:10:11.742 --> 02:10:21.650]  Where they were talking about Michael Yan's work and exposing what's going on in the Darien Gap and I think at this point the mainstream GOP lemmings are now receiving information that we've already known for years, right?
[02:10:21.690 --> 02:10:42.006]   You've known for decades, I've known for years and now it's actually being received by the lemming uh... I guess establishment Republicans via Tucker on X while he has these conversations explaining that, hey, it's not only migrants that are coming, you know, illegal immigrants coming for better opportunity for themselves at the expense of the American citizen.
[02:10:42.682 --> 02:10:49.569]  In addition to that, you have Mayorkas working with the CCP, likely, to go ahead and destroy our country by keeping their open borders.
[02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:55.594]  What do you make of the intel we got that they're using NSA face recognition and saying white supremacists are going to attack?
[02:10:56.415 --> 02:10:57.656]  That's a way to try to discredit things.
[02:10:57.716 --> 02:10:58.397]  It's so pathetic.
[02:10:58.677 --> 02:11:00.599]  The Border Patrol itself says it's a false flag.
[02:11:01.179 --> 02:11:02.180]  They're not buying any of it.
[02:11:03.001 --> 02:11:04.702]  So out of the gates, the Border Patrol's not buying?
[02:11:05.002 --> 02:11:07.783]  It's not going to work because they're not on their home turf.
[02:11:07.963 --> 02:11:20.029]  In Washington, D.C., they can do all the false flags they want and need and strive for because they have the judiciary on lock, they have the Capitol Police Board on lock because it's controlled still by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer's U.S.
[02:11:20.049 --> 02:11:20.909]  Capitol Police Chief.
[02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:22.230]  But in Texas, guess what?
[02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:27.214]  I mean, at the end of the day, don't mess with Texas and then 25 other states support Texas sovereignty.
[02:11:27.554 --> 02:11:29.736]  It's a different dynamic and we have the advantage.
[02:11:29.836 --> 02:11:33.699]  I'm not the one saying false flag and, like, the Feds are telling us this.
[02:11:33.859 --> 02:11:35.360]  Like, they're like, we're going to stop the false flag.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:38.382]  No, they're trying to inject themselves in order to push their agenda.
[02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:42.226]  Well, how screwed is the globalist that we're, like, going to the Feds?
[02:11:42.246 --> 02:11:43.767]  They're like, we're going to stop the false flag, Jones.
[02:11:44.571 --> 02:11:46.432]  The Biden criminals... Stay there.
[02:11:46.452 --> 02:11:47.772]  We'll come right back.
[02:11:48.153 --> 02:11:51.674]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:11:52.074 --> 02:11:59.077]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:11:59.277 --> 02:12:01.278]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:12:01.458 --> 02:12:02.519]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:12:02.579 --> 02:12:03.239]  He loved the idea.
[02:12:03.579 --> 02:12:07.083]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[02:12:07.123 --> 02:12:08.004]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:12:08.064 --> 02:12:08.945]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:12:09.085 --> 02:12:09.545]  Absolutely.
[02:12:09.866 --> 02:12:11.247]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:12:11.327 --> 02:12:14.751]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:12:14.991 --> 02:12:22.439]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:12:22.679 --> 02:12:34.402]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:12:34.702 --> 02:12:36.023]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:12:36.043 --> 02:12:37.043]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:12:37.303 --> 02:12:41.584]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:12:41.884 --> 02:12:42.584]  We're not going to do that.
[02:12:42.845 --> 02:12:47.486]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfulmorestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:52.750]  All right, Ivan Reikland, former Defense Intelligence Agency lawyer and Green Beret, is our guest.
[02:12:55.071 --> 02:12:55.772]  Thanks, Bayonets.
[02:12:56.432 --> 02:13:01.677]  The Deep State Marauder is here in studio, my gnome daguerre.
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:08.902]  So you've been a little busy beaver in Congress.
[02:13:08.922 --> 02:13:11.024]  There's quite a fight for the Republic.
[02:13:11.564 --> 02:13:14.286]  We got 30 minutes left before the next guest host takes over.
[02:13:14.306 --> 02:13:14.887]  What do you want to cover?
[02:13:15.805 --> 02:13:19.127]  No, let's talk about, I think, like we talked about before, we're winning.
[02:13:19.147 --> 02:13:20.368]  We're incrementally winning.
[02:13:20.508 --> 02:13:21.249]  One line of effort.
[02:13:21.689 --> 02:13:23.150]  I wouldn't lie to listeners, we are winning.
[02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.931]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:27.293]  One line of effort is that, remember the Declaration of Military Accountability?
[02:13:27.393 --> 02:13:29.134]  I'm one of the signers of the 231.
[02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:32.056]  Six of us actually were together at that rally yesterday.
[02:13:32.076 --> 02:13:36.619]  And for those that don't remember, take a look at it, militaryaccountability.com.
[02:13:36.639 --> 02:13:41.763]  And the main focus here is, we're here to admonish the lawless, encourage the fainthearted, and strengthen the weak.
[02:13:42.083 --> 02:13:44.905]  And the way we do that is, we're going to clean our own house.
[02:13:45.425 --> 02:13:48.368]  Our own institution, first and foremost, which is the Department of Defense.
[02:13:48.728 --> 02:13:56.115]  So majority, almost all, except for one of the 230 are either current service members or former service members.
[02:13:56.696 --> 02:13:58.357]  All branches of our... And it blew up.
[02:13:58.397 --> 02:13:59.578]  Tens of thousands signed on.
[02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:03.102]  Yeah, so I think we're at 30, 40 thousand that have signed on.
[02:14:04.062 --> 02:14:07.726]  And at this point, it's reached maybe 20, maybe 50 million.
[02:14:08.206 --> 02:14:10.829]  And we're at the border, and the Border Patrol's giving us everything.
[02:14:11.493 --> 02:14:16.132]   Like, here's our secret documents, here's their operations, we're trying to stop a false flag.
[02:14:16.132 --> 02:14:17.813]  That's going to really upset the globalists.
[02:14:17.813 --> 02:14:21.412]   Yeah, so we're trying to basically claw back our institutions with patriots.
[02:14:21.412 --> 02:14:25.252]   So now we're in a position where with the information you're putting out on X,
[02:14:25.252 --> 02:14:29.093]   with Tucker, with X in general, with Elon Musk, we're now in a position
[02:14:29.093 --> 02:14:33.093]   to showcase that what happened in 2020, not only with the illegal...
[02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:34.926]  You told me to read this page, but you read it.
[02:14:34.786 --> 02:14:41.065]   But then in addition to that, the illegal DOD clot shop mandate and the book that outlines
[02:14:41.065 --> 02:14:43.945]  every single aspect of Ken's component.
[02:14:43.945 --> 02:14:45.545]  You told me to read this page, but you read it.
[02:14:45.545 --> 02:14:46.545]  Go ahead.
[02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.545]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:47.545 --> 02:14:52.746]   So this book right here, written by a current Navy commander, Robert A. Green Jr., called
[02:14:52.746 --> 02:14:56.625]   Defending the Constitution Behind Enemy Lines, a Story of Hope for Those Who Love Liberty.
[02:14:57.414 --> 02:15:06.097]  This is basically a summary, over the course of the last three years, of the impact of the illegal Department of Defense clot shot mandate, right?
[02:15:06.118 --> 02:15:07.718]  They call it the COVID-19 mandate.
[02:15:07.898 --> 02:15:08.458]  Well, guess what?
[02:15:08.819 --> 02:15:16.642]  Now we're getting to the point where we're going to prove the necessary elements of a crime that results in Nuremberg 2.0 on steroids, right?
[02:15:17.162 --> 02:15:22.435]  Now, one thing I want to link to you that I really like to highlight when I talk about this book is on page 99.
[02:15:22.696 --> 02:15:25.824]  The chapter is called The Court Martial of Courage.
[02:15:26.846 --> 02:15:27.286]  I'm gonna read it.
[02:15:27.807 --> 02:15:36.633]  As the COVID-19 vaccine data began revealing significant safety concerns, Lieutenant Mark Bashaw attempted to communicate these risks to his chain of command.
[02:15:37.114 --> 02:15:39.175]  He was repeatedly shut down or ignored.
[02:15:39.555 --> 02:15:46.260]  For his own situation, Lieutenant Bashaw declined the COVID-19 so-called vaccine based on his religious convictions.
[02:15:46.701 --> 02:15:53.020]   He also ultimately declined both the masks, I call them face toilets, and the CCP-19 diagnostic
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:58.341]   tests known as the medical nose rapes on their status as emergency use products.
[02:15:58.341 --> 02:16:03.920]   So then on January 12th of 2022, he was charged with the violation of Article 92, failure
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:09.020]   to obey order or regulation and was referred for trial by a special court martial.
[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:13.220]   The bottom signature on Lieutenant Bashaw's court martial charge sheet and the person
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:18.341]   signed on behalf of Major General Robert Edmondson, who's one of the listed names that we're
[02:16:18.341 --> 02:16:22.341]  going after on the Declaration of Military Accountability.
[02:16:22.321 --> 02:16:33.628]  The jag that signed off on that general was a guy by the name of Army Colonel Yevgeny Vindman, who was the brother of the fake whistleblower Alexander Vindman.
[02:16:34.028 --> 02:16:36.129]  Does that make sense?
[02:16:36.149 --> 02:16:46.419]   This incestuous relationship between these seditious co-conspirators that when you go back and watch the video that we posted at the beginning of this segment, They're all in there.
[02:16:46.699 --> 02:16:52.382]  And when we open up all of their direct messages, I'm already getting hate on all the trolls coming out.
[02:16:52.402 --> 02:16:57.326]  Oh, they're tagging the domestic terrorist organization known as the FBI that they need to stop people from looking in.
[02:16:57.346 --> 02:17:01.388]  Oh, they're hitting us with a billion requests and hours, rather, shit on M4s for a week straight.
[02:17:01.828 --> 02:17:04.150]  We're talking tens of millions of dollars to hack attack right now.
[02:17:04.390 --> 02:17:04.870]  It's failed.
[02:17:04.890 --> 02:17:07.232]  We're still up, but they're like, they're panicking right now.
[02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:07.992]  Yeah, they're panicking.
[02:17:08.192 --> 02:17:09.693]  Because guess what?
[02:17:09.833 --> 02:17:15.116]  Just like Jack Smith used Twitter to go ahead and look into Donald Trump's Twitter account?
[02:17:15.296 --> 02:17:17.677]  He said, give me every person that ever liked Trump.
[02:17:18.417 --> 02:17:24.420]  I want to see every single person that has communicated with Jamie Raskin, with Adam Schiff on Twitter.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.621]  All of their staffers.
[02:17:25.641 --> 02:17:26.381]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:17:26.401 --> 02:17:27.662]  We shouldn't be intimidated.
[02:17:27.702 --> 02:17:29.202]  We should be honored they're coming after us.
[02:17:29.603 --> 02:17:31.263]  Because we're a lot more of us than them.
[02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:32.264]  Let's go on offense.
[02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:33.725]  How do we motivate Elon Musk to do this?
[02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:38.130]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:17:38.611 --> 02:17:40.974]  I think Elon's already got all the data in his hands.
[02:17:41.054 --> 02:17:42.096]  He's already hit all the cylinders.
[02:17:42.156 --> 02:17:43.077]  I don't know what he's going to do.
[02:17:44.579 --> 02:17:45.080]  So there you go.
[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:45.741]  That's the book.
[02:17:47.048 --> 02:17:49.629]  Now, Declaration of Military Accountability, right?
[02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:58.154]  We promise to exhaust all moral, ethical, and legal means to restore the rule of law, and we'll begin by attempting to hold senior military leaders accountable.
[02:17:58.574 --> 02:18:05.578]  This should be the template for, if you're a whistleblower in DHS or sick of what's going on there, you need to come out and do something similar to this.
[02:18:05.678 --> 02:18:09.520]  The people that don't get it, more and more military leaders saying no, other people hear about it.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:10.140]  Yes.
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:10.800]  It's a chain reaction.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:20.582]  Now, Brad Miller, who's kind of our de facto spokesperson for this declaration, did a recording with Tucker Carlson, and I think that should be airing next week.
[02:18:20.882 --> 02:18:25.323]  I think once that's out there in the broader public, the lemming Republicans are going to start to take notice.
[02:18:25.723 --> 02:18:33.365]  And those that were not complicit in the COVID, what I call the COVID coercion and the mandate molestation, they're going to basically see it for what it was.
[02:18:33.745 --> 02:18:34.625]  They were all duped.
[02:18:34.685 --> 02:18:35.145]  And guess what?
[02:18:35.165 --> 02:18:41.048]   I think all of them were duped by the same individuals That we're part of the Crossfire Hurricane Team.
[02:18:41.969 --> 02:18:44.591]  Have you ever covered the guy by the name of Brian Autin on your show?
[02:18:44.651 --> 02:18:44.911]  I have.
[02:18:44.971 --> 02:18:46.332]  Explain Crossfire Hurricane.
[02:18:46.413 --> 02:18:49.515]  That's the whole fake program to like delegitimize Trump.
[02:18:49.755 --> 02:18:57.242]  Yeah, 2016 Mike Pence is foisted on Trump to be his handler by the RNC, meaning Reince Priebus, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, right?
[02:18:57.942 --> 02:19:11.111]  And, uh, two weeks later, all of a sudden, there's an invest- counterintelligence investigation that's launched on Donald Trump, uh, and those that are within his periphery that could expose the deep state, namely General Flynn with Crossfire Razor.
[02:19:11.151 --> 02:19:13.853]  Those were the code names for the counterintelligence investigation.
[02:19:14.233 --> 02:19:19.371]   It was unlawfully started, it had no lawful predicate, and then they even went above and
[02:19:19.371 --> 02:19:25.532]   beyond by defrauding the FISA court to obtain a FISA warrant to then spy on Carter Page
[02:19:25.532 --> 02:19:29.532]   to then penetrate the entire ecosystem of the Trump campaign.
[02:19:29.532 --> 02:19:33.653]   And those that were involved in that, the senior ops guy, the senior supervisory special
[02:19:33.653 --> 02:19:36.733]  agent on that was Joseph Pientka III.
[02:19:36.733 --> 02:19:38.612]  Guess where he's sitting today, Alex?
[02:19:38.612 --> 02:19:43.493]   He's the number three guy at the San Francisco field office of the FBI coordinating still
[02:19:43.493 --> 02:19:45.333]  the censorship regime.
[02:19:45.333 --> 02:19:50.573]   And guess who was the supervisory intelligence analyst on Crossfire Hurricane?
[02:19:50.573 --> 02:19:52.172]  Guess where he is now?
[02:19:52.172 --> 02:19:57.092]   He's over at the Foreign Influence Task Force at FBI headquarters coordinating with Joseph
[02:19:57.092 --> 02:20:02.753]   Pientka and Elvis Chan, who we found out about in the Missouri v. Biden lawsuit of the First
[02:20:02.753 --> 02:20:06.492]   Amendment kind of destruction scheme of the Biden criminal syndicate.
[02:20:06.908 --> 02:20:08.789]  All these individuals are still in place.
[02:20:09.129 --> 02:20:16.550]  And Christopher, what I like to call Christopher Ray Epps, the FBI director, is the one providing top cover for all of them.
[02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:17.510]  But guess what?
[02:20:17.890 --> 02:20:22.098]   When we start to go into those DMs, Elon Musk, Wink wink.
[02:20:22.619 --> 02:20:27.927]  If you allow the public to see all this, everything will be proven beyond any doubt.
[02:20:28.288 --> 02:20:30.531]  And then we go ahead and go after them.
[02:20:31.781 --> 02:20:36.064]  They had to have if they did because that's the easiest mechanism to obtain evidence.
[02:20:36.084 --> 02:20:38.186]  Because if we do a FOIA, what are they going to do?
[02:20:38.206 --> 02:20:39.107]  They're going to block it.
[02:20:39.127 --> 02:20:40.828]  They're going to totally block everything.
[02:20:41.128 --> 02:20:44.791]  We're going to use the same precedent of good old Jackie Boy Smith.
[02:20:45.331 --> 02:20:48.073]  And what you can do as a former lawyer on.
[02:20:51.863 --> 02:20:55.907]  Fannie Willis in Georgia, and the New York... He's on my list too.
[02:20:56.568 --> 02:21:04.635]  The New York real estate trial with no jury, and then the E. Jean Carroll, I mean that is like really backfired on them, but they keep doubling down.
[02:21:05.416 --> 02:21:10.841]  They think that if they apply enough pressure, Trump and us are going to back down.
[02:21:11.181 --> 02:21:11.922]  No, it doesn't work.
[02:21:12.302 --> 02:21:15.045]  So they got most of the lemmings, right?
[02:21:15.085 --> 02:21:15.645]  They duped them.
[02:21:16.366 --> 02:21:19.427]  They got the, uh, those that were kind of hesitated.
[02:21:19.988 --> 02:21:24.550]  What they didn't get were those that were not going to bend a knee at all costs.
[02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:27.811]  Meaning you, me, and the people that are propping up.
[02:21:27.831 --> 02:21:29.912]  Well, they've done separated things, made it very clear.
[02:21:30.172 --> 02:21:30.352]  Right.
[02:21:30.452 --> 02:21:33.834]  And now we're, we're going to expose every single component of them.
[02:21:33.894 --> 02:21:37.655]  If there's any level of corruption and we're seeing it, Fannie Will- Well, that's what I don't get.
[02:21:37.695 --> 02:21:39.856]  I'm not the type of guy around- We're going to do the same thing to them.
[02:21:39.876 --> 02:21:40.797]  Well, I'm under attack.
[02:21:41.721 --> 02:21:42.742]  I don't know how to roll over.
[02:21:42.842 --> 02:21:44.002]  I'm just like, I'm going to fight harder.
[02:21:44.423 --> 02:21:44.883]  Exactly.
[02:21:45.183 --> 02:21:46.724]  You're literally beating the hell out of me.
[02:21:46.764 --> 02:21:48.085]  You think I'm going to roll over?
[02:21:48.105 --> 02:21:49.045]  They don't even give you a chance.
[02:21:49.085 --> 02:21:50.226]  It's like you're being attacked.
[02:21:50.606 --> 02:21:51.627]  What do you think we're going to do?
[02:21:51.747 --> 02:21:52.727]  No, in a game of chicken, right?
[02:21:53.348 --> 02:21:55.429]  I'm either going to win or you're going to lose.
[02:21:55.789 --> 02:21:57.190]  Those are the only two options.
[02:21:57.530 --> 02:22:00.652]  And you have that same mindset and the viewers have the same mindset.
[02:22:00.992 --> 02:22:05.715]  So the more they escalate, the quicker their demise happens, in my opinion.
[02:22:06.115 --> 02:22:09.337]  Because they're forcing an attack on people that aren't backing down.
[02:22:09.617 --> 02:22:10.257]  Yeah.
[02:22:10.297 --> 02:22:10.838]  How does that end?
[02:22:12.642 --> 02:22:15.564]  Well, I think you mentioned it earlier in one of your shows a few weeks ago.
[02:22:15.924 --> 02:22:18.806]  It comes down to, it's either mutually assured destruction or we win.
[02:22:19.246 --> 02:22:21.548]  It's up to them on how they want it to end.
[02:22:22.728 --> 02:22:24.089]  Do you think they know they're losing?
[02:22:24.109 --> 02:22:24.990]  Because they are losing.
[02:22:27.102 --> 02:22:29.583]  I think they do and that's why they're maneuvering.
[02:22:30.044 --> 02:22:33.686]  Remember Vijaya Gade, the general counsel at Twitter?
[02:22:33.926 --> 02:22:34.106]  Yeah.
[02:22:34.306 --> 02:22:39.609]  She had a nervous breakdown and she was crying when we saw reports of it when Elon Musk was going to buy X on Twitter.
[02:22:40.489 --> 02:22:42.931]  He hasn't leveraged everything that he has.
[02:22:42.951 --> 02:22:45.232]  He has dirt on everyone.
[02:22:45.312 --> 02:22:48.254]  Imagine if you were sitting on everyone's direct messages.
[02:22:48.274 --> 02:22:49.154]  I think he should attack.
[02:22:49.314 --> 02:22:50.195]  I think he should release all.
[02:22:51.069 --> 02:22:53.371]  So, I mean, what's the calculus as a business guy?
[02:22:53.391 --> 02:22:54.491]  I think he's in more danger not releasing.
[02:22:54.511 --> 02:22:55.632]  He's releasing every damn bit of it.
[02:22:55.912 --> 02:22:58.694]  If he releases at all, I mean, that's it.
[02:22:59.055 --> 02:23:03.598]  The entire Democrats are literally arrogantly talking about they're going to suppress an election.
[02:23:04.399 --> 02:23:04.919]  It's the coup.
[02:23:05.139 --> 02:23:05.659]  It's the coup.
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:06.820]  It's a coup de grace.
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:07.901]  I think they're waiting on him.
[02:23:09.302 --> 02:23:14.666]  I think Elon is probably waiting on them to take a more bolder, aggressive move on him and then he'll just... That's Elon's M.O.
[02:23:14.706 --> 02:23:16.007]  He waits until they attack.
[02:23:16.027 --> 02:23:17.228]  And then he'll just smash them.
[02:23:18.342 --> 02:23:19.622]  And this is one easy way to smash him.
[02:23:19.662 --> 02:23:20.763]  That's a smart algorithm.
[02:23:21.883 --> 02:23:24.864]  If you think you can control the attack, he always waits for the attack.
[02:23:25.824 --> 02:23:26.485]  And then he attacks.
[02:23:26.505 --> 02:23:28.965]  Because then the court of public opinion is on his side when he does it.
[02:23:29.086 --> 02:23:33.607]  Because right now, they might not be as aggressive as what they could be.
[02:23:34.267 --> 02:23:35.968]  And they have no other option.
[02:23:36.008 --> 02:23:36.828]  Let's face it, Alex.
[02:23:37.768 --> 02:23:44.739]   If they allow the election to be run free and fair, Trump decimates them, right?
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:46.721]  It's not even close.
[02:23:47.141 --> 02:23:47.742]  And what happens?
[02:23:47.782 --> 02:23:48.662]  What's the subsequent move?
[02:23:49.003 --> 02:23:50.564]  I become the Secretary of Retribution.
[02:23:52.146 --> 02:23:52.586]  And guess what?
[02:23:52.606 --> 02:23:56.609]  And you're in Congress running around really setting brush fires.
[02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:59.932]  I mean, Congress used to be super ignorant.
[02:23:59.952 --> 02:24:01.634]  They seem to be more smart now about what's happening.
[02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:03.648]  I don't know about that.
[02:24:03.688 --> 02:24:05.790]  I mean, there's pockets of capacity.
[02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:06.831]  I mean, compared to where they were.
[02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:11.015]  Yeah, I mean, people like us, we're forcing their hand.
[02:24:11.155 --> 02:24:12.977]  I'm communicating with Congress early on.
[02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:17.682]  So I started communicating once we won the Congress on the 118th Congress started January 3rd of 2023.
[02:24:18.963 --> 02:24:20.825]  And back then, they were clueless.
[02:24:21.225 --> 02:24:27.790]   And then as things developed, I started working and talking to the different Uh, committees, or at least attending the different hearings.
[02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:31.630]  And as I attended the different hearings, I obviously had access to people and started communicating with them.
[02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:32.551]  Well, guess what?
[02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:47.814]  Now that the committee that has responsibility for exposing and analyzing and researching what actually happened on January 6th, the Fed's erection parliamentary coup, the guy that runs that subcommittee is a guy by the name of Congressman Barry Loudermilk from Georgia.
[02:24:48.434 --> 02:24:53.535]  And just yesterday, I saw that he posted something on InstaGarbage, right?
[02:24:54.255 --> 02:24:55.236]  And they censored it.
[02:24:55.536 --> 02:25:00.998]  Because he's starting to get to almost the point where we already know that it was a feds direction set up.
[02:25:01.539 --> 02:25:02.659]  He's laying out the case nicely.
[02:25:02.679 --> 02:25:03.119]  Which is great.
[02:25:03.139 --> 02:25:04.520]  Go ahead and censor members of Congress.
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:05.200]  Now they double down.
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:05.601]  Yeah.
[02:25:05.721 --> 02:25:06.801]  So now they're doubling down.
[02:25:07.181 --> 02:25:07.882]  Which means what?
[02:25:08.362 --> 02:25:10.183]  Now they're going to start publishing on Rumble.
[02:25:10.763 --> 02:25:23.350]  If I were an analyst, which I am, I would expect that more and more J6 video evidence to support what's been identified by that particular committee is going to start rolling out pretty soon.
[02:25:23.370 --> 02:25:28.213]  How big is the new stuff that a Fed planted the bomb and a Fed found the bomb?
[02:25:31.973 --> 02:25:32.653]  It's hard to say.
[02:25:32.974 --> 02:25:35.515]  A lot of people don't understand the component of what happened on January 6th.
[02:25:35.555 --> 02:25:39.056]  Can we pull up this one slide that I sent to... Wherever you want, tell them to play it.
[02:25:39.116 --> 02:25:40.236]  Play the clip you want, wherever you want.
[02:25:40.516 --> 02:25:44.338]  Bring up the Capitol Police Board slide from January 6th of 2021.
[02:25:44.738 --> 02:25:48.339]  This is the insiders insider baseball game, Alex, which no one understands.
[02:25:48.399 --> 02:25:51.080]  Everybody goes after the FBI, which, yeah, they were in on it.
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:51.541]  I get it.
[02:25:52.061 --> 02:25:53.121]  Everyone goes after the FBI.
[02:25:53.141 --> 02:25:54.142]  They're just more like a cover-up.
[02:25:54.162 --> 02:25:54.782]  They're the bias.
[02:25:55.362 --> 02:25:57.263]  So, it's an onion scheme.
[02:25:57.303 --> 02:26:19.672]   So, when you look at this slide here, the very first part, if you were Owen Schroer, and you were, I guess, charged with something, whatever it was, a transgression on January 6th, or if you committed a crime on January 6th, or not January 6th, but on the Capitol grounds, and weren't charged, It was because it was the decision-making process of the people that you're looking at right here.
[02:26:19.712 --> 02:26:24.815]  Those in that circle, or that whatever polygon shape, are the three members of the Capitol Police Board.
[02:26:25.175 --> 02:26:30.317]  And they're the ones that decide the law enforcement component of what happens on the Capitol Police grounds.
[02:26:30.617 --> 02:26:52.455]   So, if Nancy Pelosi is appointing the House Sergeant-at-Arms, if the Senate Majority Leader, it was McConnell back then on January 6th, is appointing the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, and then you control the Capitol Police Chief, It's the Capitol Police Chief that decides whether or not they're going to use their discretionary authority to criminalize you in consultation with the General Counsel, which is at the bottom there.
[02:26:53.216 --> 02:27:00.420]  When you fast forward to the next slide, which is the composition of the Capitol Police Board today, if you can move on to the next slide.
[02:27:01.769 --> 02:27:10.058]  You're going to see that the only person that remains from January 6th in this entire construct, which is found in Title II of the U.S.
[02:27:10.098 --> 02:27:14.603]  Code, Chapter 29, this whole construct, is the General Counsel of the Capitol Police.
[02:27:15.936 --> 02:27:20.159]  And guess who the Capitol Police Chief is now since July 23rd of 2021?
[02:27:20.739 --> 02:27:23.041]  It's Thomas Manger, who's married to a woman.
[02:27:23.741 --> 02:27:27.544]  They live in Jamie Raskin's congressional district, and they're pretty close.
[02:27:28.164 --> 02:27:48.598]   So when you start to do the link analysis of all these people, and you start to try to figure things out, The reason why, in October, the insurrection in the Cannon Building, no one was arrested, it's because it was a Democrat op, and the Capitol Police Chief, who was appointed by Pelosi and Schumer's Sergeant at Arms back in July of 21, is not going to prosecute them.
[02:27:48.999 --> 02:28:06.379]   But if you're somebody that they need to politically persecute, From January 6th, they're going to put together an evidentiary package, manipulate the CCTV footage, coerce Capitol Police testimony, put that together, and then send it over to the Department of Justice.
[02:28:06.399 --> 02:28:09.883]  But what's going to happen now is the general public knows it was staged.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.462]  I mean, when we're down there at the border, the Feds all go, oh, they're about to state January 6th.
[02:28:14.762 --> 02:28:20.106]  The Feds, the NSA's blowing the whistle, the Feds, I mean, the Feds are telling us, we don't want a new January 6th.
[02:28:20.486 --> 02:28:21.286]  Biden's doing it.
[02:28:21.346 --> 02:28:22.847]  I mean, they've screwed themselves.
[02:28:22.967 --> 02:28:24.868]  Everyone now knows about false flags.
[02:28:24.908 --> 02:28:26.029]  Years ago, nobody knew about that.
[02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:37.736]  Agreed, but the point here is, is that we have to identify, I get it, you can say Feds, but we need to be more meticulous on identifying who the... So what are you making the pipe bomb info come out?
[02:28:38.116 --> 02:28:39.017]  So the pipe bomb info.
[02:28:40.322 --> 02:28:48.549]  So the RNC, the lady that identified the pipe bomb at the RNC handed that information over to one of the security guards at the RNC.
[02:28:48.609 --> 02:28:52.032]  I've talked to him numerous times and I'm hoping that the committee is going to start talking to this guy.
[02:28:52.712 --> 02:28:54.093]  He called it in to the U.S.
[02:28:54.113 --> 02:28:54.754]  Capitol Police.
[02:28:54.994 --> 02:28:57.396]  So the RNC response was done by the U.S.
[02:28:57.416 --> 02:28:59.638]  Capitol Police because that guy was a former U.S.
[02:28:59.658 --> 02:29:00.519]  Capitol Police officer.
[02:29:00.839 --> 02:29:04.382]  The response over at the DNC was done by the D.C.
[02:29:04.442 --> 02:29:07.425]  Metro because that area has concurrent jurisdiction between U.S.
[02:29:07.445 --> 02:29:08.666]  Capitol and D.C.
[02:29:08.706 --> 02:29:09.006]  Metro.
[02:29:09.306 --> 02:29:18.516]  When you start to learn all these nuanced jurisdictional components and look at the individual players that were involved in identifying reporting, you'll start to see how the cover-up occurred.
[02:29:19.017 --> 02:29:20.899]  And I go back to the Capitol Police Board.
[02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:28.968]   The cover-up starts with the Capitol Police Board, and the way that we address this political persecution It's not in the courts.
[02:29:29.368 --> 02:29:30.528]  It's not at the DOJ.
[02:29:30.869 --> 02:29:32.189]  It's not at the FBI.
[02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:35.411]  We have to expose the Capitol Police Board.
[02:29:35.451 --> 02:29:35.932]  And guess what?
[02:29:35.952 --> 02:29:36.892]  That General Counsel?
[02:29:37.252 --> 02:29:38.373]  He has a Twitter account.
[02:29:39.033 --> 02:29:40.834]  And it's at the nobody guy.
[02:29:41.255 --> 02:29:42.195]  Elon Musk!
[02:29:42.796 --> 02:29:46.838]  I want to see all of his direct messages as he's communicating with Harry Dunn.
[02:29:47.398 --> 02:29:49.639]  As they're lying in testimony before the JCPOA.
[02:29:49.679 --> 02:29:50.540]  And you know they did it.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:55.500]   I want to see Akinelo Gunel who has a Twitter account and his communications with that guy.
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:58.939]  I want to see his communications between him and Jamie Raskin.
[02:29:58.939 --> 02:30:05.219]   And not only that, I demand that Barry Loudermilk subpoena all of the internal communications
[02:30:05.219 --> 02:30:09.699]   of the General Counsel of the U.S. Capitol Police, the Capitol Police Chief, current,
[02:30:09.699 --> 02:30:14.179]   former, and all the leadership to include Julie Farnham and Yogananda Pittman who are
[02:30:14.179 --> 02:30:18.819]   head of the Intel and Interagency Coordination Division of the U.S. Capitol Police.
[02:30:18.819 --> 02:30:19.819]  That said, they're trying to save...
[02:30:19.819 --> 02:30:20.819]  That'll show everything, Alex.
[02:30:21.113 --> 02:30:24.214]  Everything about the Fed's erection coup, in my opinion.
[02:30:25.555 --> 02:30:27.776]  What do you think Trump's biggest obstacles are right now?
[02:30:29.517 --> 02:30:29.997]  That right there.
[02:30:30.457 --> 02:30:32.138]  I know I'm like a beaten and dead horse.
[02:30:32.759 --> 02:30:41.963]  If he wants to dispense with his DC trial with Jack Smith, he has to shine the light on every single actor- Well, by the way, they just took it off the docket.
[02:30:41.983 --> 02:30:42.424]  Talk about that.
[02:30:42.824 --> 02:30:47.206]   Yeah, I think if they took it off the docket- I haven't really thought through this.
[02:30:47.246 --> 02:30:52.747]  My initial reaction is that they see the writing is on the wall.
[02:30:53.187 --> 02:30:53.908]  It backfired.
[02:30:54.008 --> 02:30:55.408]  I can tell them.
[02:30:55.828 --> 02:30:57.509]  I don't have some computer program.
[02:30:58.229 --> 02:30:59.289]  Trump, people love him.
[02:30:59.409 --> 02:31:00.910]  Prosecuting him makes him more popular.
[02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:02.491]  And they didn't expect it.
[02:31:02.511 --> 02:31:08.875]  I think Paul Ryan, I think I saw Paul Ryan making a statement that, ooh, I didn't think that he was going to be so much more popular.
[02:31:08.895 --> 02:31:14.479]  So they're going back to the drawing board trying to figure out... Oh, even Axelrod went on Meet the Press and said, oh, he shouldn't have done this.
[02:31:14.759 --> 02:31:14.919]  Yeah.
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:15.520]  Stop.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.021]  It only made him more popular.
[02:31:17.041 --> 02:31:17.661]  But at this point, it's...
[02:31:18.604 --> 02:31:19.344]  It's off the rails.
[02:31:19.504 --> 02:31:20.644]  They're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:31:20.684 --> 02:31:23.105]  I think the only... So what do they do?
[02:31:23.225 --> 02:31:24.405]  Stage a terror attack?
[02:31:24.525 --> 02:31:28.906]  Most probable course of action, in my opinion, of the enemy, meaning the Unit Party.
[02:31:28.986 --> 02:31:30.646]  Both are the China First Republicans.
[02:31:30.666 --> 02:31:31.887]  The hijackers of America.
[02:31:31.907 --> 02:31:32.987]  China First Democrats.
[02:31:33.647 --> 02:31:38.588]  They're going to continue to try to keep him off the ballot where they can.
[02:31:39.188 --> 02:31:44.809]  Try to make it so that he is not able to secure the necessary delegates going into the RNC convention.
[02:31:45.189 --> 02:31:48.230]  And if he does... Which they charged him for doing himself, trying.
[02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:48.830]  Right.
[02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:50.371]  And so, remember, the R.C.
[02:31:50.391 --> 02:31:51.871]  Convention is going to be in Milwaukee.
[02:31:52.311 --> 02:31:53.412]  So we're looking at July.
[02:31:54.152 --> 02:32:07.436]  If he ends up securing, if they're not able to block him from getting the majority and securing the nomination in July, I suspect that the Uniparty is going to go ahead and put Michelle Obama as president for the Democrats and Gavin Newsom as the VP.
[02:32:08.016 --> 02:32:09.236]  So let's answer this question.
[02:32:09.337 --> 02:32:10.357]  No one has said this.
[02:32:11.197 --> 02:32:12.357]  And we want to get Trump in.
[02:32:12.477 --> 02:32:13.538]  He's the real president.
[02:32:13.558 --> 02:32:13.938]  We know that.
[02:32:15.842 --> 02:32:18.285]  It's almost worse for them if they kill him or steal it.
[02:32:18.785 --> 02:32:21.729]  What happens if they steal this again?
[02:32:22.369 --> 02:32:25.813]  They already saw the second, third order response that devastated them.
[02:32:26.634 --> 02:32:28.536]  Ivan Reikland, what happens if they steal it again?
[02:32:28.877 --> 02:32:29.878]  Or what happens if they kill Trump?
[02:32:30.639 --> 02:32:33.882]  That's what I was going to get to, the most dangerous course of action, right?
[02:32:34.163 --> 02:32:35.264]  I mean, what is that?
[02:32:36.545 --> 02:32:39.367]  I will say... They've turned him into literally Obenwan Kenobi.
[02:32:39.827 --> 02:32:40.828]  Yeah, one point.
[02:32:41.148 --> 02:32:47.633]  So they either try to foist, if he's gonna basically win, they're gonna try to foist a Nikki Haley or another handler like they did in the first term.
[02:32:47.913 --> 02:32:48.973]  But that's still too dangerous.
[02:32:49.354 --> 02:32:50.234]  So, for them, right?
[02:32:50.254 --> 02:32:51.315]  Because we're coming for them, right?
[02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:52.416]  We're gonna clean house.
[02:32:52.856 --> 02:32:53.677]  So then what do they do?
[02:32:54.017 --> 02:33:00.661]  They're gonna potentially go to the 1960s model, where they do an MLK, JFK, or an RFK on him.
[02:33:01.142 --> 02:33:01.982]  On Trump, right?
[02:33:02.783 --> 02:33:04.644]  And once they start killing, I think they'll stop at Trump.
[02:33:05.304 --> 02:33:05.985]  Here's what I'll say.
[02:33:06.745 --> 02:33:11.791]  And this is a message directly to every single person on the Deep State target list.
[02:33:12.232 --> 02:33:21.983]  My assessment, Ivan Reikland's assessment, that if you assassinate any political presidential candidate, whether it's RFK, whether it's Trump, guess what?
[02:33:22.403 --> 02:33:24.806]  America will do the following.
[02:33:25.366 --> 02:33:26.047]  Immediately.
[02:33:26.527 --> 02:33:28.349]  They will respond in kind.
[02:33:28.769 --> 02:33:31.751]  And they know who you are because we've created the list.
[02:33:32.212 --> 02:33:33.773]  And that's a major Rubicon.
[02:33:33.813 --> 02:33:34.493]  They should know that.
[02:33:34.674 --> 02:33:35.314]  Immediately.
[02:33:35.694 --> 02:33:37.516]  You're going to see immediate response.
[02:33:37.836 --> 02:33:40.478]  And there are only a few buildings in Washington D.C.
[02:33:40.738 --> 02:33:42.620]  that they will probably do that.
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:45.442]  Well, I hope that's not the case, but these people are crazy.
[02:33:46.202 --> 02:33:57.497]   And having said that, if they do that, Option two, behind Trump, is going to be so much better for us, and so much worse for them.
[02:33:57.557 --> 02:34:07.342]  I was about to say, if they kill him, that's best case scenario, from a sick level, from a sick level beating him, oh please kill him, which I don't, I mean, it's so good after that.
[02:34:07.983 --> 02:34:14.706]  Oh, it's going to be the best cleansing and the fastest cleansing that we've ever seen in my lifetime.
[02:34:18.385 --> 02:34:19.966]  I'm actually scared of that though.
[02:34:20.405 --> 02:34:25.685]   with the highest level of confidence that if they assassinate Trump, it is so game over
[02:34:25.685 --> 02:34:29.285]  for them and it's going to be so fast.
[02:34:29.285 --> 02:34:31.045]  I'm actually scared of that though.
[02:34:31.045 --> 02:34:32.285]  It's so explosive.
[02:34:32.285 --> 02:34:33.525]  It is.
[02:34:33.525 --> 02:34:36.004]   That's why I mean, it's basically it's a warning to them, right?
[02:34:36.605 --> 02:34:40.910]  If they go, if they cross the Rubicon, you saw how popular he was, I mean, by just prosecuting.
[02:34:40.930 --> 02:34:42.151]  When I get close to the side guys, it's not a pussy thing.
[02:34:42.171 --> 02:34:43.432]  I start getting tears because my brain goes in overdrive.
[02:34:43.452 --> 02:34:52.642]   And when I start hearing about Trump being sassy, I start like literally, because my brain is like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz No, I've thought through this.
[02:34:52.703 --> 02:34:53.924]  I mean, you think through this.
[02:34:54.145 --> 02:34:54.966]  It's a chess game, right?
[02:34:55.086 --> 02:34:57.149]  Second, third, fourth move, fifth move.
[02:34:57.610 --> 02:35:00.715]  And if they do that, it's... Well, I pray for Trump not to be killed.
[02:35:00.755 --> 02:35:02.097]  It's going to accelerate the inevitable.
[02:35:02.337 --> 02:35:05.843]  If they're dumb enough to kill him, though, they have literally ended us total victory.
[02:35:06.264 --> 02:35:06.384]  Yeah.
[02:35:07.483 --> 02:35:09.024]  I think they're dumb enough to do it though.
[02:35:08.843 --> 02:35:09.843]  I think they're dumb enough to do it though.
[02:35:09.843 --> 02:35:13.803]   And then it begs the question, well who within the deep state or the globalist unit party
[02:35:13.803 --> 02:35:18.403]  is going to be the one behind that potential assassination?
[02:35:18.403 --> 02:35:21.043]  I say there's two main options that I've thought through.
[02:35:21.043 --> 02:35:26.682]   Number one, they call on John Kerry to coordinate with his Iranian buddy, Mullahs, right?
[02:35:26.682 --> 02:35:27.682]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:35:27.682 --> 02:35:31.562]   They're going to activate supercells and they'll use a terror attack as a cover.
[02:35:32.257 --> 02:35:33.378]  You're a genius.
[02:35:33.539 --> 02:35:33.859]  I agree.
[02:35:34.019 --> 02:35:34.920]  They're going to use Iranians.
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:35.762]  That's what's being said.
[02:35:35.802 --> 02:35:37.183]  And that's what you're seeing, right?
[02:35:37.203 --> 02:35:38.465]  Some of the skirmishes going on with Iran.
[02:35:38.485 --> 02:35:39.727]  They're going to claim Iran did it.
[02:35:40.768 --> 02:35:41.309]  Oh my God.
[02:35:41.329 --> 02:35:41.910]  That's it.
[02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:42.811]  That's it.
[02:35:42.991 --> 02:35:43.131]  Yep.
[02:35:43.945 --> 02:35:47.167]  They already had that set up with the Iranians a couple years ago at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:35:47.347 --> 02:35:48.327]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:48.587 --> 02:35:50.608]  Just like the FBI did in the 60s on Mar-a-Lago.
[02:35:50.628 --> 02:35:52.309]  But no one's going to buy it.
[02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:54.851]  If you kill Trump, folks, we know it's not the Iranians.
[02:35:55.251 --> 02:35:55.451]  Right.
[02:35:55.951 --> 02:36:01.694]  John Kerry, if you're listening in, we are watching all your communications, maybe, or maybe not.
[02:36:04.355 --> 02:36:05.516]  You're dead on on Iraq.
[02:36:05.596 --> 02:36:06.977]  They're going to use the Iranians as a cover.
[02:36:07.619 --> 02:36:09.660]  Because I did that at Mar-a-Lago store a few years ago, remember?
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.641]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:16.704]  Remember they did the little video, trying to like make it look like... Because at the end of the day, Iran has a vested interest, right?
[02:36:16.905 --> 02:36:17.825]  Because they want payback.
[02:36:17.885 --> 02:36:19.726]  And Iran is definitely in bed with the left.
[02:36:20.867 --> 02:36:21.007]  Yeah.
[02:36:22.248 --> 02:36:22.648]  Absolutely.
[02:36:23.108 --> 02:36:23.929]  Jesus Christ.
[02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:27.691]  And so, which begs the question, I'm going to ask you this question, Alex.
[02:36:28.592 --> 02:36:32.494]  Who then takes the reign, if they do that, to Trump?
[02:36:36.596 --> 02:36:36.976]  I don't know.
[02:36:38.017 --> 02:36:38.437]  What do you think?
[02:36:38.457 --> 02:36:38.897]  You do know.
[02:36:40.318 --> 02:36:40.598]  Who?
[02:36:41.879 --> 02:36:42.559]  Who do you think?
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.020]  I think about it.
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:47.982]  Who's in the best position to completely castrate the deep state and crush the commies?
[02:36:48.342 --> 02:36:54.045]  That has the understanding of the national security order to go ahead and just clean house.
[02:36:54.265 --> 02:36:55.125]  He can't be president.
[02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:58.455]  He's basically already the president.
[02:36:58.635 --> 02:37:00.115]  No, he's going to be vital in the conference.
[02:37:00.195 --> 02:37:04.877]  I just think that General Flynn becomes the inevitable leader of the movement.
[02:37:05.398 --> 02:37:07.098]  It's inevitable if they do that.
[02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:08.079]  So think about it.
[02:37:09.059 --> 02:37:10.580]  Trump's probably going to be better for them.
[02:37:12.881 --> 02:37:15.001]  Because if General Flynn, I mean think about it.
[02:37:15.582 --> 02:37:21.825]   The people that General Flynn would bring into the administration The globalists are all going to prison.
[02:37:22.706 --> 02:37:25.268]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[02:37:25.629 --> 02:37:27.971]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[02:37:28.311 --> 02:37:31.454]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[02:37:31.514 --> 02:37:34.417]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[02:37:34.677 --> 02:37:45.267]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Info War and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[02:38:21.535 --> 02:38:34.175]  [Music]
[02:38:34.175 --> 02:38:36.975]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:37.036 --> 02:38:39.437]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jaysonalysis.
[02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:45.059]  We've had a lot of coverage of the breaking events relating to Texas and all that.
[02:38:45.079 --> 02:38:47.220]  So I'm going to do something a little different.
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:58.205]  The last two Fridays, I covered the topic of how to destroy a nation, what the various PSYOPs, subversion techniques and tricks there are to bring down countries.
[02:38:59.085 --> 02:39:03.247]  And one element that we haven't touched on in a good while is once again, entertainment.
[02:39:04.116 --> 02:39:11.279]  And a lot has come out in the past couple weeks, which definitely ties the entertainment world to the intelligence world.
[02:39:11.759 --> 02:39:19.022]  So I want to talk about the overlap of intelligence, of blackmail, of sex espionage, and the history of that stuff.
[02:39:19.542 --> 02:39:23.083]  Everybody knows about Epstein, that we've talked about that quite a bit in the last few weeks.
[02:39:23.443 --> 02:39:24.584]  Still kind of a hot topic.
[02:39:25.208 --> 02:39:29.652]  But there was a huge interview that dropped also a couple weeks ago that went mega viral.
[02:39:30.153 --> 02:39:34.817]  And it's the Cat Williams, the stand-up comedian, his interview that he did on a podcast on YouTube.
[02:39:36.827 --> 02:39:49.133]  Where he went really deep into discussing his experiences in Hollywood and kind of dropped some bombs and some drama that you might think, well, who cares what some comedian's drama is?
[02:39:49.173 --> 02:39:54.235]  Well, he went deeper into a lot of similar things that we've heard people like Dave Chappelle say in the past.
[02:39:54.255 --> 02:40:05.881]  So I want to talk about the history of espionage, sexpionage, and the overlap with entertainment, because we're going to understand that it's not just about controlling our culture through government or through powerful corporations.
[02:40:06.696 --> 02:40:11.421]  Media is so important and particularly entertainment for capturing our minds and our hearts.
[02:40:11.581 --> 02:40:15.926]  We all know that people would rather listen to, you know, people telling stories.
[02:40:15.946 --> 02:40:19.250]  They'd rather watch a movie and get information that way.
[02:40:19.270 --> 02:40:24.996]  And nowadays, I think movies are even being displaced because people have the attention span to even watch a movie.
[02:40:25.811 --> 02:40:33.936]  So now we're moving in the direction of just total insanity with TikTok, social media, basically frying people's attention spans and brains.
[02:40:33.976 --> 02:40:40.601]  But in order to get to where we are now, we had to have these many decades of co-opted, controlled Hollywood people.
[02:40:41.301 --> 02:40:45.724]  And again, it's not so much that entertainment and this interview is that big of a deal.
[02:40:45.844 --> 02:40:55.170]  It's the information that is in the podcast really backs up a lot of what we in the alternative media, we in the conspiracy world have said for so long.
[02:40:56.428 --> 02:41:16.173]  Williams noted for example in his interview that he had been invited to big Hollywood quote Illuminati parties and that certain deals were offered in May particularly he mentions the case of Ludacris the rapper that he was invited to the same event and there was a 200 million dollar deal offered and he decided that he would go his own way that's this is his story.
[02:41:17.254 --> 02:41:26.964]  And that he would not participate in the humiliation rituals that are required, particularly in the case of Dave Chappelle or people like Cat Williams.
[02:41:27.224 --> 02:41:32.830]  They want people to do certain actions like dressing up like women on screen.
[02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:34.431]  This is a kind of a humiliation ritual.
[02:41:34.852 --> 02:41:50.547]   And we've talked about this in terms of the mind-controlled pop stars for many years, the beta sex kitten programming that They're essentially brought in, the girls for example, as these innocent high school girls that transition into the whore of Babylon.
[02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:58.014]  They take on this very dark, very satanic imagery and that's part of the culture control, culture manipulation, toxic culture.
[02:41:58.054 --> 02:42:05.901]  We've seen it with Britney Spears, we've seen it with Katy Perry, we've seen it with so many people who have this flip and then they become super duper megastars.
[02:42:06.425 --> 02:42:10.929]  This is going to tie into what we've seen in the last few weeks with the Taylor Swift drama.
[02:42:11.369 --> 02:42:14.772]  And again, it's not that Taylor Swift and football and all that nonsense even matters.
[02:42:15.272 --> 02:42:25.060]  What matters is the fact that it displays the propaganda and the mind control that the whole of entertainment, including things like professional sports, is a part of.
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:31.885]  If you think about the NFL, if you think about NBA, all the other leagues, they pretty much have gone woke.
[02:42:32.606 --> 02:42:51.903]  Across the board especially since 2016 2017 and it's only ramped up with for example the NFL I think a couple years ago putting out entirely pro-gay and now it's moving even beyond that into other areas Pushing then you know that women and men sports are not different to the men and women aren't different.
[02:42:51.943 --> 02:43:08.717]   We can have this overlap It's all going insane by design and the ratings have tanked And so this story, this big drama, this soap opera of Taylor Swift and her her football player husband or boyfriend or whatever he is, that is all partially to bring ratings back.
[02:43:09.017 --> 02:43:10.878]  But there's a much more sinister agenda at work.
[02:43:11.338 --> 02:43:14.780]  It might even tie into psyops and intelligence operations.
[02:43:14.619 --> 02:43:17.619]  This is the Alex Jones Show, your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:43:17.619 --> 02:43:19.619]  It's Analysis Holder. We'll be right back.
[02:43:19.619 --> 02:43:30.619]  We were talking about Cat Williams, okay?
[02:43:30.619 --> 02:43:34.619]  And his crazy Illuminati party, okay?
[02:43:34.619 --> 02:43:40.619]   Yes, in this interview, Cat Williams breaks down his crazy experience of being invited to various Hollywood shindigs
[02:43:40.619 --> 02:43:46.619]   that included some sort of high-level deal that he wasn't willing to go along with
[02:43:46.619 --> 02:43:53.619]   in that long interview that's had 60 or more million views, if you count all the other clips and whatnot.
[02:43:53.619 --> 02:43:55.859]  night.
[02:43:55.101 --> 02:44:02.388]   He goes into great detail about other Drama events in Hollywood and how there's a lot of blackmail amongst comedians.
[02:44:03.348 --> 02:44:04.789]  You wouldn't think about that happening.
[02:44:04.809 --> 02:44:06.009]  You think of, oh, blackmail.
[02:44:06.049 --> 02:44:07.090]  That's Epstein.
[02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:09.891]  That's, you know, intelligence operations.
[02:44:09.931 --> 02:44:13.512]  That's, you know, British intelligence blackmailing politicians.
[02:44:13.572 --> 02:44:18.594]  But it also happens in the entertainment field and maybe not as at a high of a level.
[02:44:18.654 --> 02:44:23.216]  But the blackmail, of course, is there to control actors, actresses, comedians.
[02:44:24.189 --> 02:44:38.878]  And to you know if need be to destroy them to leak the information when it's needed, so this is really a lot more common Than we think we think of this again as like a you know high-level political scandal But it seems to be a lot more comments.
[02:44:38.918 --> 02:45:07.567]   Maybe not as efficient and sophisticated as the kinds of operations that Maxwell and Epstein and Henry Vincent and other people were running to to blackmail people in other famous cases now in the case of The Taylor Swift situation, I'm not alleging blackmail, but I'm using this as a separate example of the lack of attention and poll numbers and so forth that Biden's getting where Trump is far ahead in the polls.
[02:45:07.587 --> 02:45:09.389]  And so they're really pulling out all the stops.
[02:45:09.729 --> 02:45:18.276]  Back in 2016, Biden called upon Katy Perry and Cardi B to be the pop stars that would promote his campaign.
[02:45:18.316 --> 02:45:20.318]  At that time, the DNC had them perform.
[02:45:21.696 --> 02:45:33.860]  And now we're looking at a calling upon the biggest mega pop star who has, for odd reasons that still aren't exactly clear to me, completely blown up beyond anything we've ever seen in the realm of pop stars.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:40.502]  I mean, she's kind of like Jacko Elvis or more level now in terms of Taylor Swift.
[02:45:41.062 --> 02:45:50.065]  So there's an interesting history to Taylor Swift where she comes from a very prominent, wealthy, I think Federal Reserve connected family at some point in her lineage.
[02:45:51.238 --> 02:45:54.479]  They put a lot of money and effort into helping her become a pop star.
[02:45:54.499 --> 02:45:57.560]  I'm not saying that she's not, you know, an all-talented.
[02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:03.321]  I know maybe two Taylor Swift songs that I've even heard of, so I don't really know what her music is like.
[02:46:03.941 --> 02:46:05.102]  I'm not a huge fan of it.
[02:46:05.542 --> 02:46:09.343]  I'm not a 16-year-old girl, contrary to what I'm sure many of you thought.
[02:46:10.803 --> 02:46:17.263]   But her music does seem to tap into young girls and their psyche, at least that's what a lot of
[02:46:17.263 --> 02:46:18.462]  the girls report.
[02:46:18.462 --> 02:46:21.342]  And so the Biden campaign is really jumping on this.
[02:46:21.342 --> 02:46:22.144]  And this is nothing new.
[02:46:22.144 --> 02:46:28.143]   If you think back to the 1990s, MTV was really hip to doing this with Rock the Vote, right?
[02:46:28.143 --> 02:46:34.064]   They brought out all the 90s bands and pop stars, and they were really pushing Bill Clinton at that
[02:46:34.064 --> 02:46:37.182]   time, you know, get out, rock the vote, vote for Bill Clinton, in other words.
[02:46:37.182 --> 02:46:40.703]   And so the Democrats have always done this, where they bring in the pop stars,
[02:46:40.703 --> 02:46:51.183]   and they're really just trying to coax the lowest IQ, lowest low information voters out there to
[02:46:51.183 --> 02:46:58.783]   jump on board the cool party of, I guess, the trans-oppressed Olympics people known
[02:46:58.783 --> 02:47:00.144]  as the Democratic Party now.
[02:47:00.144 --> 02:47:01.644]   *sniff* Yeah.
[02:47:02.033 --> 02:47:06.515]  Basically the demonic, satanic weapon that's now bringing down the entire country.
[02:47:07.253 --> 02:47:13.863]  Of course, the rhinos participate in that for sure, but the Democratic Party just seems to be really just wild.
[02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:21.611]  Crazy and obviously that's going to reflect when it comes to Hollywood and entertainment.
[02:47:22.011 --> 02:47:33.973]  And so I think that there's a ratings element to this with her helping the NFL and their tanking ratings post woke coming back up getting new generation of people into football, but it's no longer just football.
[02:47:34.053 --> 02:47:49.660]   It's also the drama of will Taylor Swift make it from her Japan concert flying back to the US in time to have you know, I don't even know what's going on at the Super Bowl.
[02:47:49.981 --> 02:47:55.746]  Used to be, you know, the traditional conservative Illuminati Super Bowl party that we used to have, right?
[02:47:55.766 --> 02:48:01.191]  We used to have the traditional rite of all seeing eyes and Lady Gaga.
[02:48:01.331 --> 02:48:03.653]  And now we've gone off into soap opera land.
[02:48:03.693 --> 02:48:11.235]   So I guess, I guess it's not, it's no longer good enough to have, you know, Masonic rituals at the Super Bowl now we've got to have a
[02:48:11.235 --> 02:48:16.704]   full-on soap opera with The biggest pop star in the world and her football player
[02:48:16.704 --> 02:48:24.475]   Boyfriend or whatever he is So we also know that he's a spokesperson for Big Pharma for
[02:48:24.475 --> 02:48:26.837]   Pfizer I think that's also very suspicious.
[02:48:26.897 --> 02:48:30.619]  We know that Taylor Swift is very big on promoting the Democratic Party and Biden.
[02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:34.221]  And again, I think this is a really obvious cheap political stunt.
[02:48:34.301 --> 02:48:35.342]  But is there more at work?
[02:48:35.382 --> 02:48:41.725]  Well, it turns out a couple of weeks ago, there was a report that I think Fox, Jesse Watters hinted upon.
[02:48:41.865 --> 02:48:48.389]  He stumbled upon the the NATO discussion with a bunch of women, a bunch of feminists at NATO.
[02:48:49.059 --> 02:48:54.822]  Batting around the idea of what pop stars to recruit for disinformation operations.
[02:48:55.102 --> 02:49:02.005]  Now, they called it combating misinformation, but I'm going to translate that for you, which is disseminating misinformation.
[02:49:02.506 --> 02:49:06.888]  In other words, to bring in pop stars to control and steer the agenda.
[02:49:06.908 --> 02:49:11.230]  Now, there's nothing new for this, for this idea, this idea coming over.
[02:49:11.250 --> 02:49:12.750]  This is an old tactic.
[02:49:12.850 --> 02:49:13.811]  Elvis was used.
[02:49:14.753 --> 02:49:18.317]  To promote the draft and young people going into the military.
[02:49:18.337 --> 02:49:20.639]  He didn't actually want to be a part of that.
[02:49:20.679 --> 02:49:23.242]  They brought him into that kind of forced him into that his handlers.
[02:49:24.563 --> 02:49:27.827]  Other pop stars have been used to promote for example, the Reagan era.
[02:49:28.468 --> 02:49:32.208]  Michael Jackson was used for certain things.
[02:49:32.208 --> 02:49:35.387]   And again, there's a long history of government utilizing pop stars.
[02:49:35.387 --> 02:49:40.868]   Nixon deputized Elvis to fight the war on drugs, this kind of stuff.
[02:49:40.868 --> 02:49:44.588]   That's way, by the way, that was way more wholesome than what we see now, right?
[02:49:44.588 --> 02:49:48.268]   Now it's like, let's bring in Taylor Swift to promote the trans agenda, right?
[02:49:48.268 --> 02:49:50.987]   I mean, that's essentially what you have with the promotion of
[02:49:50.987 --> 02:49:51.827]  the Democratic Party.
[02:49:51.827 --> 02:49:58.427]   So this is all very intensely studied from a psychological warfare perspective.
[02:49:58.367 --> 02:50:01.810]  It doesn't mean that Taylor Swift is an asset or an agent.
[02:50:02.470 --> 02:50:04.372]  This was all over Twitter in the past few days.
[02:50:04.832 --> 02:50:09.015]  And of course all the normies and all the libs are on Twitter saying, you're ridiculous.
[02:50:09.035 --> 02:50:12.397]  There's no way Taylor Swift is a CIA operative.
[02:50:12.477 --> 02:50:14.159]  Nobody said she was a CIA operative.
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:17.201]  So that's a straw man fallacy.
[02:50:18.010 --> 02:50:27.875]  What was said was that pop stars are often cajoled, used, manipulated, or even brainwashed into supporting these kinds of agendas.
[02:50:28.516 --> 02:50:30.377]  And it shouldn't seem far-fetched.
[02:50:30.417 --> 02:50:37.341]  I mean, think back to how many pop stars at various times have promoted things like The Jab, right?
[02:50:37.361 --> 02:50:40.442]  There was a giant concert of multiple pop stars.
[02:50:40.482 --> 02:50:43.424]  I think J-Lo was there, Foo Fighters, right?
[02:50:43.484 --> 02:50:45.165]  Pushing that you need to get the vaccine.
[02:50:45.894 --> 02:50:52.901]  And that was again, I'm sure, a Democratic Party-funded type of event, and I'm sure it had all the same cast of characters that we expect.
[02:50:53.742 --> 02:51:01.450]  You know, we can think about Katy Perry making music videos about military recruitment, actually targeting girls.
[02:51:02.592 --> 02:51:09.853]  I don't remember the name of the song, but basically she gets dumped by her boyfriend and then she decides to get revenge to go out on the front lines.
[02:51:10.494 --> 02:51:14.274]  I don't know how that's not getting revenge on your dad or your boyfriend or anybody or whatever.
[02:51:14.294 --> 02:51:15.614]  That's just ridiculous.
[02:51:15.634 --> 02:51:16.995]  That's falling for the system.
[02:51:18.055 --> 02:51:19.515]  But this again goes way back.
[02:51:19.555 --> 02:51:23.936]  Hollywood was promoting through the Jessica Lynch story, through G.I.
[02:51:23.976 --> 02:51:29.097]  Jane, the idea that not only can women be in the military, they actually need to be on the front lines.
[02:51:29.955 --> 02:51:30.155]  Right.
[02:51:30.636 --> 02:51:33.279]  That's the promo idea in those movies.
[02:51:34.059 --> 02:51:35.861]  And that's actually in the academic literature.
[02:51:35.901 --> 02:51:44.530]  You can read the, I think it's the Donald Baines book on Operation Hollywood, where there's a whole section on the promotion of feminism through certain Hollywood movies.
[02:51:45.011 --> 02:51:51.217]  Not just feminism, obviously that's been there for a long time, but the idea that the women need to be on the front lines, which is ridiculous.
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:57.626]  There might be situations where a military might need women for certain roles or something.
[02:51:58.647 --> 02:52:05.874]  I don't think it's ideal, but nobody's ever really thought that it was a good idea to put women on the front line or try to put them into special forces.
[02:52:05.934 --> 02:52:07.276]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:52:08.757 --> 02:52:22.027]   It's not that women don't have You know their own set of skills and techniques and capabilities It's just that that's typically what men are better fitted to obviously right like having babies or something like that, right?
[02:52:24.168 --> 02:52:40.948]   Although I guess Arnold Schwarzenegger is also pretty good at having babies if you ever watched Junior with him and Danny DeVito interesting Way ahead of its time propaganda there too, by the way But back to the issue of Psyops and pop stars.
[02:52:41.530 --> 02:52:43.920]  This has a long, long history.
[02:52:44.927 --> 02:52:49.889]  And it doesn't require that every pop star be a trained agent of the C.A.
[02:52:50.149 --> 02:52:52.510]  It just means that they can be used by powerful forces.
[02:52:52.990 --> 02:53:06.396]  And in the next segment, we're going to go into the history of this, because a lot of people don't even know the history of sexpionage and pop stars and powerful people, entertainers being used in precisely this way, going back a long time.
[02:53:06.416 --> 02:53:10.318]  But we're going to focus on the last 100 or so, 120 years of this happening.
[02:53:11.318 --> 02:53:12.098]  This is The Outro.
[02:53:15.970 --> 02:53:16.391]  Stay tuned.
[02:53:21.374 --> 02:53:24.136]  Back to the Alex Jones Show, your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:53:24.156 --> 02:53:30.461]  We were talking about the history of sexpionage, swallow operations, honey traps, and so forth.
[02:53:30.501 --> 02:53:37.226]  At least that's what it's called when you get into the background of how these operations work to blackmail people.
[02:53:37.827 --> 02:53:39.128]  And there's nothing new here.
[02:53:39.168 --> 02:54:04.357]   In fact, there's a long history of actors, entertainers, Musicians, cabaret dancers, etc., who were cajoled into, or perhaps recruited into, or maybe they even signed up out of patriotism or some other motivation that they thought was legitimate, to work for their government or some foreign government to engage in these kinds of operations.
[02:54:04.517 --> 02:54:13.807]   If you go back to, for example, the character at the time of World War I, You may have heard of the Mata Hari, right?
[02:54:13.847 --> 02:54:22.103]  She was a famous cabaret dancer, a Dutch exotic dancer, a courtesan convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I.
[02:54:22.794 --> 02:54:35.020]  She was executed by a farming squad in France, and she was known kind of as the first femme fatale, and her job was to supposedly, you know, entrap and get dirt on powerful, famous people.
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:43.204]  It's debated as to how successful or prominent she really was in doing these operations, but she's one example amongst many.
[02:54:43.284 --> 02:54:48.326]  There is the case of the figure, if you may have heard of her, named Sonia Wiegert.
[02:54:48.626 --> 02:54:55.869]   She was basically The top celebrity actress from Norway in the 1930s and 40s.
[02:54:56.429 --> 02:55:00.190]  She's very reminiscent, if you've never seen her, of Nicole Kidman.
[02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:01.390]  She favors her quite a bit.
[02:55:02.130 --> 02:55:14.774]  And she was, as she became, as I said, the most famous actress in Norway at that time, she was actually asked by her government to spy on the Nazis, which initially she said she wouldn't do.
[02:55:15.660 --> 02:55:20.487]  Because she was, you know, mainly an entertainer, performer, theater actress, and a film star.
[02:55:21.108 --> 02:55:26.936]  And then they said, well, we've arrested your dad, and we actually need you now to sleep with Nazi high command.
[02:55:26.956 --> 02:55:30.862]  There's a famous movie that was made that's, I think, on Prime, Netflix, or whatever.
[02:55:30.882 --> 02:55:31.563]  It's called Spy.
[02:55:32.664 --> 02:55:33.365]  It's a great movie.
[02:55:33.425 --> 02:55:37.468]  I recommend it because you'll notice that, you know, she was cajoled into this.
[02:55:37.508 --> 02:55:39.490]  They basically said, we have your father.
[02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.791]  He's under arrest.
[02:55:41.371 --> 02:55:45.615]  And unless you sleep with Nazi high command, we're not going to release your father.
[02:55:46.355 --> 02:55:47.736]  This ended up ruining her career.
[02:55:48.297 --> 02:55:54.882]  People thought that she was a traitor to her country and that she was just going to be sleeping around to get ahead or something like that.
[02:55:56.523 --> 02:56:01.067]  But in fact, no, she was actually cajoled into being a sex operative.
[02:56:04.617 --> 02:56:07.519]  There's also the case of Olga Chekhova.
[02:56:07.899 --> 02:56:15.004]  She was the most famous actress from Russia in the circles of Hitler during the 1930s and 40s.
[02:56:15.044 --> 02:56:17.186]  She starred in about a hundred different movies.
[02:56:18.427 --> 02:56:32.135]   And Olga Chekhova was famously also spying, at least many people think, many historians think, spying for Stalin as an NKVD operative, but she was in some hundred films.
[02:56:32.175 --> 02:56:57.933]   She was in a even films that Hitchcock made so she was Known as many speculated that she was a kind of a Mata Hari of her day Now in the case of Other famous figures you might have heard of there's the the character of John Ford one of the most famous directors back in the days of Westerns and John Wayne and I think John Ford won at least three.
[02:56:59.585 --> 02:57:00.326]  Academy Awards.
[02:57:00.426 --> 02:57:07.952]  One of those, I think, was for the Battle of Midway, which was actually an OSS produced wartime production documentary.
[02:57:07.972 --> 02:57:10.314]  It was kind of propaganda at that time.
[02:57:10.374 --> 02:57:23.565]  So declassified documents from the CIA actually illuminate the really close relationship that John Ford had with the first director of the predecessor to the CIA, the OSS, namely Wild Bill Donovan.
[02:57:24.145 --> 02:57:24.946]  They were very close.
[02:57:24.966 --> 02:57:27.548]  They exchanged a lot of letters and information, a lot of contact.
[02:57:28.698 --> 02:57:34.084]  And as a lot of historians have now noted, it seems like the OSS actually helped.
[02:57:34.642 --> 02:57:38.444]  John Ford get quite a few of those awards that he got.
[02:57:38.884 --> 02:57:44.126]  I'm not saying he wasn't talented, not saying that any of the stars and entertainers had no talent.
[02:57:44.507 --> 02:57:47.268]  Some of them have no talent and they're propelled to the top.
[02:57:47.308 --> 02:57:51.210]  At least that's one of the allegations that Cat Williams makes.
[02:57:51.850 --> 02:58:02.275]  And he argues that because they've gone along with certain compromise, with certain sexual actions and so forth, because they've allowed themselves to be filmed and compromised, they are propelled.
[02:58:03.744 --> 02:58:05.846]  Beyond their actual merit.
[02:58:06.847 --> 02:58:28.730]   But in the case of John Ford, I'm not saying he wasn't a good filmmaker or director, but it's interesting that he basically created this project called the Field Photographic Project, which was used by the OSS to film and to photograph Quite a few scenes, famous imagery that you notice from
[02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:29.502]  World War II.
[02:58:29.502 --> 02:58:32.381]  A lot of this goes into his Battle of Midway.
[02:58:32.381 --> 02:58:37.582]   But again, this is Hollywood's own personal hero, right, is what he was known as.
[02:58:37.582 --> 02:58:43.221]   And a big part of that was the fact that he worked with the OSS.
[02:58:43.368 --> 02:58:55.397]  Other famous figures like Dominican theologian and Vatican II ecumenist, Father Felix Morleone, also worked for the OSS as he worked for the Vatican.
[02:58:56.002 --> 02:58:58.883]  But he was also a film writer.
[02:58:59.224 --> 02:59:07.167]  In fact, he produced and I think he wrote the screenplay for a very famous Roman Catholic film, Flowers of St.
[02:59:07.207 --> 02:59:10.068]  Francis, which was very popular back, I think, in the 50s.
[02:59:10.629 --> 02:59:12.970]  So again, this is nothing new.
[02:59:13.050 --> 02:59:14.290]  This is pretty common.
[02:59:15.391 --> 02:59:18.012]  People who were in the OSS, I think there's a guy named Verlert.
[02:59:18.452 --> 02:59:26.579]   He also worked with Donovan and then went back to Hollywood and worked with people like Like John Ford.
[02:59:27.880 --> 02:59:31.584]  Now, these are not people who are necessarily sexually compromised.
[02:59:31.865 --> 02:59:32.605]  I'm not saying that.
[02:59:32.625 --> 02:59:45.759]  I'm just giving examples of people who had intelligence connections or were sexually compromised or were involved in these types of operations, connecting them directly to the highest levels of the entertainment industry.
[02:59:46.468 --> 03:00:03.223]  Likewise, for example, in the music industry, the famous CIA operative, an actual operative, Miles Copeland, he recently gave an interview, in fact, on his music career, on his background as a producer and running basically a label.
[03:00:03.764 --> 03:00:12.712]  And he talks about how all the stuff that he learned when he was doing CIA operations in Egypt and Syria, we've lectured through his whole book, by the way, Game of Nations.
[03:00:13.332 --> 03:00:16.514]  If you go to my YouTube channel, you can find my lecture where I go through that whole book.
[03:00:16.934 --> 03:00:33.408]   It's very revealing because he talks about false flags, he talks about compromise, all the kinds of operations that you think a consultant, aka CIA operative, would be doing in the Cold War for those kinds of operations. But in the recent interviews,
[03:00:33.408 --> 03:00:41.067]   Copeland talks about his history in the music industry, and he pioneered certain genres that
[03:00:41.067 --> 03:00:43.759]  kind of popped up in the 80s.
[03:00:43.759 --> 03:00:49.678]   He was, of course, related to Stuart Copeland from the police.
[03:00:49.828 --> 03:00:54.231]  I think Miles was the manager for The Police for some time.
[03:00:54.251 --> 03:01:03.138]  And then other famous acts that he was involved with like Fine Young Cannibals and songs that came out in the 80s and 90s.
[03:01:03.218 --> 03:01:05.600]  But he was also kind of on the forefront of New Wave.
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.963]  So New Wave music is closely connected to Miles Copeland.
[03:01:09.983 --> 03:01:12.465]  He kind of foresaw that trend rising.
[03:01:13.406 --> 03:01:30.502]   There you see Ian Copeland who's the One of the one of the gang there one of the members and then you see miles over there on the left and Miles again very very famous CIA operative now remember in miles's book if you Punk scene too.
[03:01:30.522 --> 03:01:46.187]   Yeah, I forgot about the punk scene miles was was closely involved in the punk scene and If you read Miles' book, he says that if you really want to understand the long-term goal of all these CIA operations in all these other countries, he says just read Bertrand Russell and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:01:47.788 --> 03:01:51.210]  And he says you'll understand that the long-term goal is to depopulate.
[03:01:51.971 --> 03:01:53.692]  So, that's the whole thing.
[03:01:53.732 --> 03:01:54.893]  That's what it's all about.
[03:01:54.933 --> 03:01:58.636]  So, there's all these operations, but the long-term goal is really to just depopulate.
[03:01:58.676 --> 03:02:02.078]  Now, we come back when we talk more about famous stars and spies.
[03:02:02.098 --> 03:02:03.219]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:02:03.239 --> 03:02:04.840]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Nozzles.
[03:02:05.353 --> 03:02:14.862]  Media matters, the Democratic Party, MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[03:02:15.483 --> 03:02:17.345]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[03:02:18.226 --> 03:02:19.407]  Go f*** yourselves!
[03:02:21.162 --> 03:02:27.466]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[03:02:27.806 --> 03:02:41.013]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[03:02:41.773 --> 03:02:42.194]  F*** you!
[03:02:42.734 --> 03:02:50.741]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[03:02:51.181 --> 03:02:55.144]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[03:02:55.363 --> 03:03:04.962]   Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[03:03:04.962 --> 03:03:15.863]  [outro music]
[03:03:15.724 --> 03:03:22.424]   talking about the history of sexual blackmail, sexpionage, as it's called.
[03:03:22.424 --> 03:03:25.523]  In the entertainment industry, it has a long track record.
[03:03:25.523 --> 03:03:31.824]   And part of the reason for that is that it overlaps with the history of many famous celebrities
[03:03:31.824 --> 03:03:37.543]   and entertainers who were recruited into espionage and spy work.
[03:03:37.543 --> 03:03:41.984]   Now, I have to be careful here, 'cause people always create a straw man.
[03:03:40.810 --> 03:03:41.551]  They misunderstand.
[03:03:41.611 --> 03:03:46.718]  I'm not saying that all the A-list celebrities are spies or that they're all working for the CIA.
[03:03:47.399 --> 03:03:48.380]  It's not like that.
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:56.490]  It's more so that certain people are recruited into and have a history of working with the CIA in Hollywood and that this is very well known.
[03:03:57.381 --> 03:04:11.287]  In fact, as time goes by, more and more biographies are written, more and more things are declassified, and we learn more about the close relationship between various government agencies and Hollywood, which is a lot closer than people think.
[03:04:11.387 --> 03:04:19.751]  In fact, if you go to my Twitter, I have the clip up from the old Ben Affleck interview from a few years ago at either The Telegraph or The Guardian.
[03:04:19.771 --> 03:04:26.714]  I don't remember which entity it was, but he's talking about the movie Argo, which of course he won an Academy Award for.
[03:04:27.722 --> 03:04:40.706]  And if you remember, the plot of Argo is that the CIA is using a cut-out Hollywood studio and a movie as a cover for one of their operations to extract people during the Iran hostage situation.
[03:04:41.346 --> 03:04:53.529]  And so, at least as far as we are told, there's some truth, basically, loosely speaking, to this Argo event where they created a fake science fiction movie for a CIA operation.
[03:04:54.129 --> 03:04:59.064]   And in the course of many interviews, that Ben Affleck gave at the time.
[03:04:59.064 --> 03:05:01.903]  He noted that Hollywood is full of CIA agents.
[03:05:01.903 --> 03:05:04.144]  It's just that most people don't know that.
[03:05:04.144 --> 03:05:08.984]   Of course, he wasn't saying necessarily that he himself was that, but it is interesting
[03:05:08.984 --> 03:05:16.103]   that he does seem to have a lot of connections to agency affiliated studios, operations, and so forth.
[03:05:16.103 --> 03:05:24.123]   In fact, his former wife, Jennifer Garner, went from the show Alias to then working for doing PR.
[03:05:24.019 --> 03:05:24.879]  There's the interview right there.
[03:05:24.899 --> 03:05:25.680]  I don't know if you guys have it.
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:30.404]  If you want to play that section where he talks about it, if you have it ready there.
[03:05:32.966 --> 03:05:35.828]  If not, I can just, I can, you can go find it on my Twitter.
[03:05:36.529 --> 03:05:36.729]  Go ahead.
[03:05:40.819 --> 03:06:14.346]   Yeah, you'll notice like on my Twitter it's kind of it's it's I've got it set right there to where he talks about it in that in that video he says you know that he almost sounds like he was a little surprised but then we find out when I wait a minute Jennifer Garner goes from the show Alias which was directly consulted on by the CA for many years the JJ Abrams spy show and then she does basically PR work for the CA where she pushed a lot of recruitment stuff and did a lot of videos and And at least at a PR level was doing that kind of stuff.
[03:06:14.386 --> 03:06:20.252]  Now, in my view, though, actually, some people have been working for agencies.
[03:06:20.332 --> 03:06:25.596]  We know people like Arnon Milkon worked, I think, for Massad Connections in Hollywood.
[03:06:26.277 --> 03:06:32.952]   We know that people like George Clooney has worked very closely with CIA connected things.
[03:06:32.972 --> 03:06:38.618]  And then we have people like Angelina Jolie, who didn't just train under a CIA handler for many years.
[03:06:38.958 --> 03:06:42.741]  Melissa Mele, she actually became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:06:43.302 --> 03:06:46.165]  And some Hollywood people actually seem to do that as well.
[03:06:46.905 --> 03:06:59.523]   And we know that a lot of people who starred in certain shows like 24 or, you know, the Homeland, the Claire Danes, Show like all of those seem to be very closely intelligence connected TV shows as well.
[03:06:59.883 --> 03:07:07.985]  And again, it's not surprising because there's always been a really close connection between the deep state and Hollywood all the way back to the beginnings of Hollywood.
[03:07:08.506 --> 03:07:15.727]  In fact, if you don't know Wonderland Studios, which was the Air Force, the famous Air Force cutting edge studio in the 1950s and 60s.
[03:07:18.008 --> 03:07:21.351]  That studio was actually used by Walt Disney.
[03:07:21.791 --> 03:07:30.458]  It was used by Marilyn Monroe, Jimmy Stewart, all the top Hollywood people had access to this famous studio up in Wonderland.
[03:07:30.498 --> 03:07:32.660]  It's up in the Hollywood Hills.
[03:07:32.680 --> 03:07:38.365]  You have to drive up Mulholland Drive to get there, which is an interesting road in history there.
[03:07:40.499 --> 03:07:43.522]  Again, this is the most famous cutting-edge studio.
[03:07:43.542 --> 03:07:57.972]  In fact, you can go on YouTube and watch Jimmy Stewart being filmed at Wonderland Studios, the Air Force studio there, doing a lot of promos, doing a lot of FBI stuff, because he was actually working with the FBI.
[03:07:58.453 --> 03:08:02.576]  So maybe we could play this clip here and you'll get an idea of what Ben Affleck's talking about.
[03:08:06.531 --> 03:08:09.132]  Actors in Hollywood who also moonlight as agents, do you think?
[03:08:09.152 --> 03:08:10.793]  I think there are probably quite a few, yes.
[03:08:10.893 --> 03:08:14.634]  I think probably Hollywood is full of CIA agents, and we just don't know it.
[03:08:15.455 --> 03:08:18.936]  And I wouldn't be surprised at all to discover that, you know, this was extremely common.
[03:08:19.436 --> 03:08:20.297]  Are you a CIA agent?
[03:08:20.577 --> 03:08:21.357]  I am, yes.
[03:08:21.457 --> 03:08:24.378]  And now you've blown my cover, so there goes my career.
[03:08:25.179 --> 03:08:26.999]  I just hope the directing thing better work out.
[03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:35.943]  Now, of course, he says all he's joking, but again, there's a long history to famous actors and actresses.
[03:08:37.128 --> 03:08:46.595]  Being in the CIA, now we mentioned a couple lesser-known foreign people, but people don't know that, for example, Houdini worked for a time doing spy work.
[03:08:47.096 --> 03:08:48.897]  Jimmy Stewart worked directly with the FBI.
[03:08:49.097 --> 03:08:52.860]  In fact, he's part of a movie promoting the FBI called the FBI Story.
[03:08:53.400 --> 03:09:02.727]  If you watch the Wonderland Studios videos you can find on YouTube, you can see him filming a lot of the propaganda pieces for the FBI.
[03:09:03.108 --> 03:09:07.028]   Julia Child, the famous TV cook, Was a member of the OSS.
[03:09:08.049 --> 03:09:15.252]  Errol Flynn, famous actor for many years, was believed to be a spy for Hitler, working in Hollywood.
[03:09:15.272 --> 03:09:22.937]  And in fact, Cary Grant was tasked by the OSS to supposedly, or at least the story is, to spy on Errol Flynn.
[03:09:24.097 --> 03:09:27.939]  John Ford, as we mentioned, was closely tied with the OSS.
[03:09:27.999 --> 03:09:32.542]  Billy Wilder, the famous Hollywood luminary writer and so forth.
[03:09:33.226 --> 03:09:35.447]  A director, Billy Wilder, worked closely with C.D.
[03:09:35.487 --> 03:09:40.549]  Jackson, who also worked in a lot of Hollywood productions.
[03:09:40.989 --> 03:09:41.209]  C.D.
[03:09:41.249 --> 03:09:46.992]  Jackson, of course, is the father of the doctrinal warfare program, the CIA's plan to utilize religion.
[03:09:47.392 --> 03:09:48.672]  We all know about Ian Fleming.
[03:09:48.733 --> 03:09:50.173]  I've talked about that for many years.
[03:09:50.273 --> 03:09:58.692]   I did grad work on the history of Ian Fleming and using James Bond as an icon on a proper During the Cold War.
[03:09:58.792 --> 03:10:00.353]  I wrote two books that cover this.
[03:10:00.413 --> 03:10:05.614]  If you want, you can go to my website and get signed copies of Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2 in the shop.
[03:10:05.674 --> 03:10:09.595]  If you find this topic interesting, you can see the shop there at the top left.
[03:10:10.215 --> 03:10:12.716]  And if you get my books, you do get signed copies.
[03:10:13.336 --> 03:10:17.177]  Noel Coward, the famous, again, in the circles of Ian Fleming.
[03:10:17.997 --> 03:10:26.939]  He was very close to Walt Disney, British intelligence operative who helped set up the OSS with people like William Stevenson and Ian Fleming.
[03:10:27.737 --> 03:10:28.999]  The predecessor of the CIA.
[03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:32.104]  Walt Disney worked very closely with the CIA and the FBI.
[03:10:32.124 --> 03:10:38.213]  In fact, the CIA is who procured the land for the Florida Disney operation.
[03:10:39.235 --> 03:10:42.538]  Frank Sinatra worked closely with the FBI and organized crime.
[03:10:43.278 --> 03:10:51.505]  Audrey Hepburn helped out to inform for the UN and for anti-fascist operations.
[03:10:51.745 --> 03:10:55.048]  Marlene Dietrich offered to spy for the OSS.
[03:10:55.088 --> 03:11:02.013]  She was also suspected of being a Nazi spy for many years by the FBI, but actually it turns out she was trying to spy for the OSS.
[03:11:03.994 --> 03:11:06.155]  Again, there are many, many, many instances of this.
[03:11:06.215 --> 03:11:07.035]  It's a long history.
[03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:08.155]  It's a fascinating tale.
[03:11:09.356 --> 03:11:14.877]  Few people know about this, but... Oh, I can't forget Christopher Lee.
[03:11:14.917 --> 03:11:19.839]  Christopher Lee was a royal, I think RAF, RAF assassin.
[03:11:20.159 --> 03:11:25.780]  So he actually has quite a bit of history, not just in espionage, but actually in assassinating people.
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:27.801]  And he talked about this in interviews.
[03:11:27.861 --> 03:11:31.842]  It eventually came out that he was involved in this kind of stuff, but...
[03:11:33.317 --> 03:11:38.080]  You know, this is the reality of the world that we live in, and there's many, many more instances of this, right?
[03:11:38.100 --> 03:11:48.947]  There's famous models who were tasked with being spies for the OSS, marrying certain European nobility who were suspected of being fascists.
[03:11:49.627 --> 03:11:55.170]  In fact, one of the most famous Hitchcock films is actually about this, and it stars Cary Grant as a raven.
[03:11:55.651 --> 03:11:56.571]  It's called Notorious.
[03:11:56.631 --> 03:11:58.332]  If you've never seen Notorious, I recommend it.
[03:11:58.392 --> 03:12:02.415]  It's one of the earliest films to mention in the screenplay the OSS.
[03:12:03.662 --> 03:12:09.828]  And Kerry Grant plays an allied spy who is tasked with seducing Ingrid Bergman.
[03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:18.056]  And the belief is that Ingrid Bergman then could inform on James Mason, who is a Nazi sympathizer.
[03:12:18.476 --> 03:12:27.385]  But Kerry Grant uses his seduction techniques as a male seducer to basically bring Ingrid Bergman under his thumb.
[03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:33.153]  And so this stuff is even in the movies, which is ironic, right?
[03:12:33.173 --> 03:12:41.219]  We think about, you know, all kinds of cases of Chuck Beres and people who are rumored to have worked for the CIA as well.
[03:12:41.239 --> 03:12:43.421]  Of course, he claims that that wasn't the case.
[03:12:44.041 --> 03:12:47.724]  But isn't it interesting that George Clooney made the movie about Chuck Beres?
[03:12:47.583 --> 03:12:51.363]   This is the oxygen show and I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's analysis
[03:12:51.363 --> 03:13:00.962]   Welcome back to the auction I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and we're talking about...
[03:13:02.335 --> 03:13:09.557]  Famous people in Hollywood and entertainment and the music industry who also had close connections to spy agencies.
[03:13:09.637 --> 03:13:27.622]  And by looking at this, we begin to see that it's not that farfetched to think that intelligence agencies who want to control the thoughts and perceptions of the American population, the public, maybe they would want to use famous actors and singers to sway public opinion.
[03:13:27.682 --> 03:13:39.605]   I mean, this is kind of a no-brainer to me, but People all over Twitter in the past couple weeks have just been losing their mind over this idea that pop stars might be functioning in that role.
[03:13:40.365 --> 03:13:53.208]  Well, if you think about, for example, famous dancer and singer Josephine Baker, did you know that she was involved in spying and espionage work to inform on Nazis?
[03:13:54.069 --> 03:14:00.210]  They recruited Moe Berg, the famous catcher, to work for the OSS and do spy work.
[03:14:01.104 --> 03:14:07.909]  If you don't know it, I mean, even Sterling Hayden worked for the OSS as a spy for a time.
[03:14:08.490 --> 03:14:13.353]  And I mean, again, the more you read about this, the rabbit hole just goes deeper and deeper and deeper.
[03:14:13.734 --> 03:14:34.235]   It's more the norm, I would say, for really powerful elite people because When you get to that level of A-list or, you know, superstar, you're going to be in the circles of so many famous people, and you're also going to be granted access to a host of powerful people that most people are never going to have access to.
[03:14:34.615 --> 03:14:36.817]  So you're very valuable in that role.
[03:14:37.297 --> 03:14:41.505]   And if you've watched, you know, something like Is it a dangerous mind?
[03:14:41.565 --> 03:14:44.947]  I think the Clooney movie about Chuck Beres.
[03:14:44.987 --> 03:14:53.371]  And again, the story of Chuck Beres, the TV host, the gong show guy, being recruited to work for the CIA and to even do assassin work.
[03:14:53.411 --> 03:14:56.993]  I mean, that's kind of a far-fetched tale if you watch the movie.
[03:14:57.053 --> 03:15:00.775]  And of course, it's still disputed and debated as to whether it was the case.
[03:15:00.855 --> 03:15:14.780]   But, you know, it's actually insightful in this regard because When George Clooney, I think he plays the handler, the recruiter, when he tries to recruit Chuck Beres in the story, he propositions him with things like patriotism.
[03:15:15.447 --> 03:15:16.948]  Yeah, don't you want to support your country?
[03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:28.779]  And I think in a lot of cases, you know, the time of World War Two or during the Cold War, you know, people like Jimmy Stewart, you know, who seems as Hollywood goes to have basically hardly any scandals.
[03:15:29.660 --> 03:15:37.006]  In fact, they tried to force him to go to prostitution houses because he was so famously not scandalous.
[03:15:37.527 --> 03:16:08.893]   And in fact, Jimmy Stewart was You know known for being at least personally speaking moral person, and he was actually a pretty badass Fighter pilot and hero if you if you look at what he was doing in the wartime Scenario in the war theater, so I don't think that you know Jamie Stewart working with the FBI was because he was a you know bad person yeah, there's the scene right there where George Clooney's recruiting Sam Rockwell who's doing the Chuck Barrett story right and
[03:16:09.645 --> 03:16:24.373]  And if you don't know, that story is about how Chuck Beres was a TV host and he was doing a lot of TV work, but under the cover of his travels and so forth, he was actually doing CIA work and was supposedly even assassinating people.
[03:16:24.413 --> 03:16:26.514]  Now, again, that's not super far-fetched.
[03:16:27.254 --> 03:16:40.180]  If we think about somebody like Christopher Lee, and I'm not alleging that Christopher Lee was assassinating people while he was an actor, but he talks about being an assassin, or it's at least come out that he most likely was doing that.
[03:16:40.240 --> 03:16:44.202]  We know he was in the Royal RAF, I think.
[03:16:45.763 --> 03:16:46.944]  Oh, the RAF, excuse me.
[03:16:48.681 --> 03:16:52.485]  So again, a lot of this is, as we said, mainline history.
[03:16:52.545 --> 03:16:53.806]  So it's not speculation.
[03:16:54.187 --> 03:17:02.655]  The Washington Post has a pretty long, extensive write-up on the famous people that I've mentioned and their spy work.
[03:17:03.016 --> 03:17:06.079]  So even mainstream media and news can report about this.
[03:17:06.099 --> 03:17:06.959]  Excuse me, SAS.
[03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:07.660]  Thank you very much.
[03:17:07.700 --> 03:17:32.996]   I got it backwards as to which Government entity he was working with but one of the ways with that we know that that's the case with Christopher Lee is that you can watch the video on YouTube where there's outtake interviews for the shooting of the Lord of the Rings trilogy with With the director and the various actors and there was a scene where Brad Dorf, right?
[03:17:34.397 --> 03:17:44.462]   Stabs Sauron and Sauron falls off of his tower and And the director and everybody was saying, oh, you need to scream when this happens.
[03:17:45.163 --> 03:17:49.026]  And Christopher Lee says, well, of course, you don't scream when you're stabbed.
[03:17:49.046 --> 03:17:52.109]  And everybody says, what do you mean you don't scream when you're stabbed?
[03:17:52.849 --> 03:17:58.314]  And he says, now, trust me, I know when you're stabbed in the back, you gasp for air because it pierces your lung.
[03:17:59.215 --> 03:18:00.656]  And everybody says, well, how do you know that?
[03:18:01.201 --> 03:18:02.002]  Yeah, that's it right there.
[03:18:02.022 --> 03:18:03.384]  Peter Jackson is talking about it.
[03:18:03.464 --> 03:18:08.851]  And Christopher Lee basically implies, well, I know because I've done this before.
[03:18:09.552 --> 03:18:12.115]  So I know what happens when you stab somebody in the back because...
[03:18:13.095 --> 03:18:15.036]  I was a British assassin, right?
[03:18:15.056 --> 03:18:18.218]  So he was like, legit James Bond stuff, right?
[03:18:19.358 --> 03:18:20.999]  I think that seems to be the case.
[03:18:21.079 --> 03:18:26.602]  And multiple mainstream publications have reported on this in regard to Christopher Lee.
[03:18:27.042 --> 03:18:28.223]  But again, this is nothing new.
[03:18:28.583 --> 03:18:34.986]  This is long history in Hollywood of these close connections and these close operations.
[03:18:35.806 --> 03:18:39.268]  And there was a recent book that came out a couple of years ago.
[03:18:39.288 --> 03:18:41.089]  It's called Chaos.
[03:18:41.789 --> 03:18:42.670]  Tom O'Neill, I think.
[03:18:43.417 --> 03:18:46.839]  And O'Neal was on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[03:18:46.859 --> 03:18:57.684]  They did multiple interviews and O'Neal went into a lot of really good information, a lot of unknown information, because he really plowed deeper into the idea of is there a connection between Manson and MKUltra?
[03:18:59.364 --> 03:19:00.365]  And the book is great.
[03:19:00.385 --> 03:19:00.965]  It's fascinating.
[03:19:00.985 --> 03:19:09.869]  But they also makes a lot of connections with other actors and TV people that you might not know about or haven't heard about, or they were forgotten TV stars in the 1970s.
[03:19:10.369 --> 03:19:11.830]  Many of them worked with the CIA.
[03:19:12.833 --> 03:19:36.449]  And of course, if you think about the music industry, the music scene, you know, Dave McGowan has a book, Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon, about the whole history of the Laurel Canyon movement, the scene, that was actually the, yeah, there's the Chaos book, Manson, the CIA, and Secret History of the 60s, and he goes through a lot of TV stars connected to organized crime and to the CIA, and some of the TV stars even worked for the CIA in the first few chapters, for example.
[03:19:37.170 --> 03:19:46.508]   But McGowan's book goes into the history of the music scene, In Laurel Canyon, which is really, again, this is where Wonderland Studios is, the Air Force studio that I mentioned earlier.
[03:19:47.168 --> 03:19:52.171]  By the 1960s, Laurel Canyon becomes kind of the hotbed of the burgeoning hippie scene.
[03:19:52.791 --> 03:20:00.875]  And so prior to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco and that area, the real hippie scene comes out of Laurel Canyon.
[03:20:01.736 --> 03:20:06.338]  And this is where we get, for example, the doors and you think, well, what do the doors have to do?
[03:20:06.378 --> 03:20:14.916]   Well, did you know that Admiral Morrison was involved in the Gulf of Tonkin Uh, false flag incident that Admiral Morrison is Jim Morrison's dad.
[03:20:15.609 --> 03:20:35.178]  And if you see the pictures of Jim Morrison before the doors, he was this really clean-cut, sort of preppy, nerdy guy who decided, oh, I'm going to go to art school or whatever he was studying, and suddenly becomes the image in the face of this burgeoning, hedonistic, Dionysian, you know, hippie movement, right?
[03:20:35.278 --> 03:20:38.180]  Or the rock and roll, you know, scene of the 60s.
[03:20:38.260 --> 03:20:52.119]   And the deeper that you plumb into the history of the Laurel Canyon scene, And we find out about the mamas and the papas, we find out about the doors, we find out about all these people who have really high-level military and deep state connections.
[03:20:52.879 --> 03:20:57.660]  This goes pretty much throughout all the characters that you've heard about, the famous people from the 1960s.
[03:20:57.740 --> 03:21:07.537]   I'm not saying that everybody in the 1960s counterculture movement was an agent, but we do know that bands like the Grateful Dead, Very close connections to working with the CIA.
[03:21:07.677 --> 03:21:08.698]  People like Tim Leary.
[03:21:08.778 --> 03:21:11.421]  Tim Leary actually brags in YouTube videos.
[03:21:11.461 --> 03:21:12.382]  You can go look it up.
[03:21:12.422 --> 03:21:14.604]  Tim Leary, CIA.
[03:21:14.905 --> 03:21:22.213]  The first video that comes up is Tim Leary saying that, well, I would thank the CIA for the 1960s counterculture movement.
[03:21:22.733 --> 03:21:24.135]  He says that's who was really behind it.
[03:21:24.815 --> 03:21:30.315]   So, That means that not the whole thing or that all the counterculture is false or bad.
[03:21:30.395 --> 03:21:38.317]  It means that when you have a counterculture movement that perhaps is organic, that is anti-war against the Vietnam War, etc.
[03:21:38.737 --> 03:21:42.298]  What happens is that this establishment, the system says, okay, how can we co-opt that?
[03:21:43.158 --> 03:21:51.540]  And then you get basically the drug culture, the hedonistic element of it, it becomes the focus rather than the legitimate activism.
[03:21:51.579 --> 03:21:57.620]   Because even at that time you had people questioning the big corporations and the banks and so
[03:21:57.620 --> 03:22:02.620]   forth, profiting off of and prolonging these wars and these conflicts.
[03:22:02.620 --> 03:22:07.338]   And so there was legitimate opposition in the 1960s to the wars.
[03:22:07.338 --> 03:22:08.819]  Then how do you get rid of that opposition?
[03:22:08.879 --> 03:22:15.541]  Oh, let's take that whole counterculture and let's turn it into being about sex, drugs and rock and roll, turn it into a hedonistic thing.
[03:22:15.841 --> 03:22:20.342]  And that really dispels the legitimate opposition and activism in those groups.
[03:22:20.362 --> 03:22:39.227]   And that's the thesis of the book is that really the 1960s counterculture really becomes a culture toxifying thing to get all the boomers basically addicted to various drugs and, you know, ruining people's Relationships and so forth with the free love operations in the 1960s.
[03:22:39.327 --> 03:22:42.148]  And we couldn't be where we are today without all that stuff.
[03:22:42.408 --> 03:22:46.631]  So remember, the thesis today is not just that pop culture is bad news.
[03:22:46.671 --> 03:22:51.133]  We all know this, but it's a lot deeper and more nefarious than we typically think.
[03:22:51.593 --> 03:23:10.550]   It's actually high-level people compromising people to make sure that the arts are a tool of the establishment, that the arts push the agenda Of the Fortune 100, Fortune 500, that there's no legitimate counterculture, because the arts and counterculture could be really powerful and really legitimate.
[03:23:10.910 --> 03:23:14.772]  That's why it has to be so tightly controlled, managed, and steered.
[03:23:15.312 --> 03:23:22.477]  And of course, the CIA, their Congress for Cultural Freedom out of the Cold War, was one of the key means by which they controlled this movement.
[03:23:22.556 --> 03:23:28.096]   Be sure and head over to the InfoWars store, buy those products and support the tip of the sphere, the Alex Jones
[03:23:28.096 --> 03:23:28.556]  Show.
[03:23:28.556 --> 03:23:33.556]  [Music]
[03:23:33.556 --> 03:23:35.556]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II.
[03:23:35.587 --> 03:23:37.929]  They never talked about what happened in World War II until after they died.
[03:23:37.949 --> 03:23:39.450]  We got to dig into their stuff and see it.
[03:23:40.251 --> 03:23:42.552]  And my mom's dad was only on a few missions.
[03:23:42.592 --> 03:23:45.154]  Thank God he already got killed as a fighter pilot in World War II.
[03:23:45.814 --> 03:23:49.197]  And crash landed and broke a bunch of bones and he was out of the war.
[03:23:50.237 --> 03:23:52.679]  The other one did more missions than he was told to do.
[03:23:53.480 --> 03:23:55.861]  Out of North Africa and then in Italy and the whole thing.
[03:23:56.242 --> 03:23:59.424]  And then was there for four years and in Germany when it fell.
[03:24:00.743 --> 03:24:02.405]  He told my dad a little bit about when he died.
[03:24:02.465 --> 03:24:04.887]  We got all his documents and all his medals and all his stuff.
[03:24:05.567 --> 03:24:08.370]  And man, the letters about, we see the flag.
[03:24:08.650 --> 03:24:09.571]  We're going into it.
[03:24:09.911 --> 03:24:10.732]  Those are the targets.
[03:24:11.052 --> 03:24:11.693]  We're going to hit it.
[03:24:12.373 --> 03:24:14.615]  You know, Billy, best buddy, just died.
[03:24:14.635 --> 03:24:15.596]  His plane just blew up.
[03:24:16.137 --> 03:24:18.499]  And man, there is something about that.
[03:24:18.879 --> 03:24:20.100]  Like, we're going in.
[03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:21.922]  We're not running away from the attacks.
[03:24:22.202 --> 03:24:23.704]  We're flying into the attack.
[03:24:24.324 --> 03:24:28.205]  Because we got something to deliver and God said deliver it.
[03:24:28.465 --> 03:24:31.506]  And I'm going to deliver more payloads.
[03:24:32.266 --> 03:24:36.147]  The reason I volunteered for more missions is we have slayed the enemy.
[03:24:36.367 --> 03:24:37.688]  We have destroyed them.
[03:24:37.928 --> 03:24:39.128]  We have wrecked them.
[03:24:39.408 --> 03:24:41.569]  God has given me nothing but victory.
[03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:53.221]  And the idea now, when I've been given nothing but victory, that I won't continue the missions and I won't continue hammering them, but I can't do it without you.
[03:24:53.442 --> 03:24:55.144]  Where are you getting a better bang for the buck?
[03:24:55.324 --> 03:24:59.444]   So I tell you now, Nitric Boost became a best seller because Dr. Judy Mikovich talked about
[03:24:59.444 --> 03:25:00.724]  it and what a great product it is.
[03:25:00.724 --> 03:25:01.724]  She has nothing to do with it.
[03:25:01.724 --> 03:25:04.203]   It's got all the ingredients she says, one of the best formulas she's seen to clean out
[03:25:04.203 --> 03:25:06.724]   your blood and empower your heart and brain and your arteries.
[03:25:06.724 --> 03:25:08.683]  Young, old, everybody should be on it.
[03:25:08.683 --> 03:25:12.882]   And now we even went to a bigger manufacturer and got an even higher quality, stronger version
[03:25:12.882 --> 03:25:14.963]  that just came in today on the 18-wheeler.
[03:25:14.963 --> 03:25:20.283]  And it is nitricboostinfowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:25:20.283 --> 03:25:21.283]  You need Nitric Boost.
[03:25:21.283 --> 03:25:22.283]  It's there.
[03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:23.581]  I wish we'd done a bigger run.
[03:25:23.601 --> 03:25:26.743]  Next Level Foundational Energy, Methylfolate, all the B-Complex.
[03:25:26.843 --> 03:25:27.463]  It's available.
[03:25:27.683 --> 03:25:31.866]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:25:31.906 --> 03:25:34.947]  Get a signed copy that's a fundraiser of my book, The Great Awakening.
[03:25:35.188 --> 03:25:36.028]  I need your support.
[03:25:36.168 --> 03:25:36.809]  I'm thankful.
[03:25:36.929 --> 03:25:39.110]  And I want to thank all of you that got it and did support.
[03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:42.812]  But I'm really talking to the 99% of you, and it's way more than that now.
[03:25:42.932 --> 03:25:45.573]  That hear this show and never buy a damn thing.
[03:25:45.753 --> 03:25:46.814]  We're in the fight, folks.
[03:25:46.974 --> 03:25:53.237]  And I'll get in the damn airplane, and I'll start the engines, and I'll take off, and I'll fly over the enemy, and I'll drop the truth on their ass all day.
[03:25:53.297 --> 03:26:01.902]  But if I don't got bombs getting loaded, and jet fuel, or diesel, or kerosene getting put in the engines, I can't take the son of a bitch off, and I can't go do it.
[03:26:02.122 --> 03:26:13.610]   And we've already had, all glory to God, and at the level of God, but all support to you for your support, all credit to the audience, we've already I'll use the analogy.
[03:26:13.630 --> 03:26:18.658]  It's like we go to Las Vegas last 29 years on air, and we put a quarter in the slot machine, we win $1,000.
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:21.844]  We go play blackjack, we spend $1,000, we make $100,000.
[03:26:24.008 --> 03:26:25.569]  We go to the roulette wheel, we make a million.
[03:26:25.609 --> 03:26:26.870]  We never even lose!
[03:26:27.611 --> 03:26:31.514]  I get tortured, I get attacked, I get lied about, I get physically attacked.
[03:26:31.814 --> 03:26:35.016]  People come to my house, I don't even get into that, what that's like for my family.
[03:26:35.276 --> 03:26:45.644]  But as long as I don't care, and as long as I got courage and trust in God, like Job did, we have, for every attack, for every little slap I get, is a dagger in the enemy.
[03:26:45.984 --> 03:26:49.307]   For every time they thump me in the face, Is a fist right in their nose.
[03:26:49.507 --> 03:26:51.929]  For every time they break my leg, they get destroyed.
[03:26:52.149 --> 03:26:53.870]  One of their whole cities gets vaporized.
[03:26:53.890 --> 03:26:54.951]  Using that as an analogy.
[03:26:55.231 --> 03:26:57.192]  We are devastating them!
[03:26:57.453 --> 03:26:59.434]  This operation is a devastator!
[03:26:59.734 --> 03:27:00.915]  The enemy fears it!
[03:27:01.095 --> 03:27:01.776]  They hate it!
[03:27:01.936 --> 03:27:03.137]  They hate the spirit of it!
[03:27:03.297 --> 03:27:04.337]  They know it's real!
[03:27:04.858 --> 03:27:05.938]  It's everything they hate!
[03:27:06.659 --> 03:27:07.760]  So empower me!
[03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:09.041]  Energize me!
[03:27:09.321 --> 03:27:10.001]  Pray for me!
[03:27:10.322 --> 03:27:11.282]  Buy the products!
[03:27:11.963 --> 03:27:12.963]  Get off the fence!
[03:27:14.184 --> 03:27:14.945]  God's watching!
