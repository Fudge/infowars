[00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:19.885]  It's Tuesday, September 17th, 2024.
[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.946]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:26.347]  Kyle Rittenhouse is coming up in studio in one hour.
[00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:28.708]  Hillary just called for Republicans' mass arrests.
[00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:34.285]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:41.551]  48 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 34 seconds.
[00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:44.693]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:46.935]  World War III is on the ballot.
[00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:51.739]  The end of free speech, the total destruction of our country, the continued annihilation of our border.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.202]  It's all on the table.
[00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:57.445]  All right.
[00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.547]  Massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:04.448]  Kyle Rittenhouse will be in studio along with other amazing guests.
[00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.470]  He'll be with us in 59 minutes in studio.
[00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.291]  He's on with Harrison Smith or just ended.
[00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.512]  Couldn't have him on in a more perfect time.
[00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.954]  With the second amendment, the Democrats calling for martial law.
[00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:23.317]  It's now become very clear that Ryan Wesley Roth or Roth had help.
[00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:26.479]  Even the FBI is coming out and saying that now.
[00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:30.878]  Things are getting really, really crazy here by the minute.
[00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:32.759]  You have P. Diddy indicted and arrested.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.982]  And in the indictment, which I've got a copy of right here.
[00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:37.263]  At least I did.
[00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:38.224]  Reprint that for me, please.
[00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:41.827]  And we got a big report on this coming up.
[00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:46.011]  They admit, it's reported, it's alleged by witnesses.
[00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.980]  That these parties were all videotaped, which they've confirmed, with hidden cameras or put on hard drives.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.621]  It's a 1990s, 80s term, videotape.
[00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:04.623]  And that the head of the largest record company in the world was directing it with him, just like what we saw with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.204]  And this was reportedly underage girls and boys.
[00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:15.477]  Homosexual sex and the people were going there knowingly in most cases to be compromised.
[00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:18.479]  So this is guaranteed another CIA operation.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.181]  It's huge.
[00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:27.266]  But the Hillary statement, she went on Rachel Maddow's show.
[00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.190]  And there's so few viewers of it, even though this broke yesterday.
[00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.471]  We only learned about it last night.
[00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:36.412]  She said this yesterday.
[00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.006]  We're good to go.
[00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:11.692]  Corporate governmental coup that's been in control of our country really since the 60s and that whole system is now coming to an end.
[00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:17.535]  But they're trying to claw us back with them into their fate.
[00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.978]  And so that's why things are so dangerous because these people are cornered rats.
[00:03:24.578 --> 00:03:27.880]  Here's a clip of Hillary Clinton and we'll have more of it coming up next segment.
[00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:38.006]  ...Trump back in 2016, but I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:50.594]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence because... Yeah, better deterrent.
[00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:54.877]  Like she's talking about the price of gasoline or something or the price of tomatoes at the store.
[00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:55.117]  Yeah.
[00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.962]  We need to go from civilly or criminally.
[00:04:00.143 --> 00:04:03.625]  And when she says that, that means that's what the power structure is planning to do.
[00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:09.169]  So they decide something's disinformation.
[00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.251]  You know, they're the biggest liars around on record.
[00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:12.311]  They're the grand champions.
[00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:14.353]  Then they try to put you in jail.
[00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:16.835]  And they're introducing this idea everywhere.
[00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:25.781]  I see the left all over the place on national TV, on HBO, on X, everywhere saying, Alex Jones should be in jail.
[00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:34.303]  For the things he said, and of course they misrepresent even what I've said, but the things they claim I said are protected under the First Amendment.
[00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.866]  So, they're really going to try it.
[00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:38.907]  They're going to go for it all.
[00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:44.353]  And imagine living under their social credit score if they try to, or trying to get in place if they're successful.
[00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:52.260]  With everything we do being tracked and then being punished financially for not submitting, we're being put into chains right now.
[00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:55.432]  So many more calls for violence.
[00:04:55.472 --> 00:04:57.653]  They're on MSNBC calling for Trump to be shot.
[00:04:57.673 --> 00:04:58.413]  I have video of that.
[00:04:59.134 --> 00:04:59.854]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:01.575]  Follow me on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:09.700]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, September 17th, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.102]  I am your embattled host coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:17.484]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:32.767]  Humanity is struggling for its very survival and humanity is rallying and rising.
[00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.994]  All right, we are 48 days out for the most important election in world history than the 76 days of hell once President Trump was president-elect.
[00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:49.219]  They know from the real actuaries and numbers he is going to win in a gigantic landslide bigger than
[00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.865]  2016.
[00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:53.865]  He did not win in a giant landslide in 2020.
[00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:56.147]  People believe the Q stuff that he was invincible.
[00:05:56.527 --> 00:05:57.328]  That really got us.
[00:05:57.708 --> 00:05:59.550]  And the fraud was big enough to defeat us.
[00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.932]  Only by an average of 10,000 votes if you look it up.
[00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:02.852]  Some 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, 12,000, 15,000 in the battlegrounds.
[00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:04.453]  But now people understand it's a desperate situation.
[00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:15.619]  It won't look like a landslide.
[00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.720]  They're going to try to continue to stuff the ballot boxes.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.783]  But a bunch of states have already had Supreme Court rulings at their state levels, like Pennsylvania yesterday, that they can't do that.
[00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:25.704]  So they're desperate.
[00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:26.685]  That's why they tried to kill Trump.
[00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:33.489]  In the last two months and two days, twice, they will try again.
[00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.294]  Now, we have Hillary Clinton coming out on Rachel Maddow yesterday, one day after another assassin tried to kill Trump.
[00:06:43.894 --> 00:06:48.998]  And he wrote a book a year and a half ago saying he wants to kill Trump and people quote, have permission to kill Trump.
[00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.359]  What a control freak.
[00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.580]  I'll give you permission to kill Trump.
[00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.763]  And he wants nuclear war to cleanse the earth.
[00:06:54.943 --> 00:06:57.325]  I mean, what a psychotic death cult member.
[00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:03.190]  And you look at him, he looks like a cross between a male cheerleader and a pedophile.
[00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:08.154]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:09.435]  Ryan Wesley Roth.
[00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:22.934]  And then we've got all the Democrats running around still saying in obvious, you know, fake slip of the tongues, like, somebody needs to shoot Trump.
[00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:24.896]  I mean, I mean, I didn't mean to say that.
[00:07:25.797 --> 00:07:30.440]  Then we've got all these Lincoln Project people and US senators.
[00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:31.802]  We got to take him out.
[00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:33.343]  We got to put a bullet in him.
[00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:39.988]  We put out a compilation yesterday and then a bunch of other people posted clips I'd forgotten about in new clips.
[00:07:40.048 --> 00:07:40.769]  I mean, I've got like,
[00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:49.198]  Two compilations that are different clips, and then I've got three new clips, and then before I went live, I found another clip I haven't sent to the crew yet.
[00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:51.499]  So there's so many clips of them saying, kill Trump.
[00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:52.559]  I can't even keep track of it.
[00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:53.579]  That's just basically all I do.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:01.222]  So, I get up at five in the morning, I go to bed around midnight, and I spend time with the family, probably three hours a day.
[00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:02.222]  But other than that, I'm working.
[00:08:03.422 --> 00:08:05.243]  And hell, half the time I'm sneaking off and working then.
[00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:09.324]  So, for everything I know, there's probably 10 times worse.
[00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:12.957]  So this is just total cuckoo land.
[00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:17.360]  Hillary Clinton said it's time to ban free speech.
[00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.962]  It's time to arrest people for their speech.
[00:08:19.002 --> 00:08:19.962]  Time to arrest MAGA.
[00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:24.606]  If they define it as disinformation, one of the biggest liars the planet's ever seen on record.
[00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.588]  These are world champion liars.
[00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:32.571]  I mean, if they were boxers, they'd be Mike Tyson in his prime, swinging fists and elbows.
[00:08:33.732 --> 00:08:34.432]  So we've got that.
[00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:41.298]  We got Eric Prince on Trump Assassin appearing in Blackrock commercials.
[00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.901]  That's both assassins are in Blackrock commercials, that's confirmed.
[00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:50.263]  Blackrock was sponsoring and is underwriting the Ukraine invasion on record.
[00:08:51.444 --> 00:08:56.986]  And so they paid for the ad that has Ryan Wesley Roth in it and Crooks in it.
[00:09:01.109 --> 00:09:04.130]  They're paying people to be in these ads and then they turn out to be shooters.
[00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:05.471]  That's the...
[00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:07.643]  We're good to go.
[00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:29.904]  Just like Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:39.488]  And they are implicating the head of the most powerful record company in the world that over a third of the yearly hits for decades is that company.
[00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:42.650]  And they are directly the feds.
[00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:50.414]  With the witnesses obviously they're going up the chain here that this was a blackmail operation just like Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:55.170]  The question is, the Feds have been covering up Epstein.
[00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.951]  It looks like they're not covering up P. Diddy.
[00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.913]  Was this a private, corporate, blackmail operation?
[00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:04.415]  I mean, we know that record companies have always been as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
[00:10:05.155 --> 00:10:06.796]  Or is it with an intelligence agency?
[00:10:07.457 --> 00:10:13.280]  Well, the intelligence agencies, the FBI, are famous for their own blackmail operations, going back, of course, to J. Edgar Huber.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.764]  And in my experience and research, they would not allow an operation this big and this powerful to operate without
[00:10:22.076 --> 00:10:27.818]  Their approval, and there's intel coming out that the Feds, at least in previous administrations, were getting information out of this.
[00:10:28.739 --> 00:10:38.542]  So, one thing the Feds can do is bust their own operation, then have all that information, and it's kind of reverse engineering, or what they call it is parallel construction.
[00:10:38.922 --> 00:10:41.303]  The Feds already have the info because they're behind most of it.
[00:10:41.944 --> 00:10:50.347]  And then they have to show juries and grand juries and courts, courts, then grand juries, then juries, that's the order, how they got the info.
[00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:56.401]  So they then go and do an investigation, knowing where to look, and then parallel construct everything they already have.
[00:10:56.682 --> 00:11:13.176]  So, I'd say about a 99% chance this is a parallel construction operation, and the feds are pulling the plug on their own operation, so that they can then apply more blackmail on the Hollywood system that's crumbling, and their control is crumbling beneath their feet.
[00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:15.538]  So we've got all of that.
[00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:23.051]  We've also got McClatchy Newspapers reporting, CIA admits it broke into Senate computers.
[00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:25.692]  Senators call for spy chief Alster.
[00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:33.295]  That's always been going on.
[00:11:33.315 --> 00:11:38.698]  When they talk about Trump being a threat to, quote, democracy, they're the threats to our republic.
[00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:46.422]  And, you know, there's an MSNBC guest on, one of Kamala's operatives, one of her superdelegates, one of her representatives.
[00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:50.987]  And everybody's getting upset about her saying we need to shoot Trump, and then that's bad enough.
[00:11:51.087 --> 00:11:55.588]  But the clips I reposted yesterday on X saying that's an issue.
[00:11:55.628 --> 00:11:59.929]  But the big one is, she says, we can't let these Americans know what we're doing.
[00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:01.369]  Trump's going to give them the intel.
[00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:04.690]  Well, that's his right as president and was his right as president to classify stuff.
[00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.590]  Read the Constitution.
[00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.991]  He is the executive branch.
[00:12:07.051 --> 00:12:08.711]  He is the executive branch.
[00:12:10.674 --> 00:12:11.814]  A lot of folks wanted another king.
[00:12:11.854 --> 00:12:12.795]  They said, no, we won't do that.
[00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:19.177]  We'll have checks and balances, but he will be over the executive, and in emergencies and in issues of national security, he will be the king.
[00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:24.219]  And then only the people can remove him or the people's representatives in Congress.
[00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:25.160]  That's the check and balance.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:38.545]  It's not that he has a right to do anything, but you've got to have it separate, a separation of powers, or the founders said, we don't want a king, but if we don't have some type of a super executive that's a limited king,
[00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:46.605]  The courts will become kings, or the legislature will become king, and set up their own oligarchies, or plutocracies.
[00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:56.730]  And that's what they've done already, but now it's the bureaucracy is the fourth of state, and it's got bigger britches than the other three branches, and it's trying to bring in the inspector general system.
[00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:03.513]  They brought it in the 70s, now take them to the Supreme Court, and now an unelected inspector general controls the Supreme Court.
[00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.534]  I mean, that's the real bureaucratic coup here.
[00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:06.975]  But I digress.
[00:13:11.018 --> 00:13:13.219]  Now, Kyle Rittenhouse is in the studio in 45 minutes.
[00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:13.979]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:14.839]  I've never met him before.
[00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:17.040]  Very interesting young man.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.640]  Very smart.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.841]  And he was smart and very well-spoken when it first all happened a few years ago.
[00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:22.881]  Four or five years ago?
[00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:23.741]  How long was that now?
[00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:25.082]  Like a million years ago.
[00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:30.463]  That was back in August of 2020.
[00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:36.725]  And now he's really, really well-spoken and informative.
[00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:43.434]  And he's gonna be with us covering the waterfront coming up, and another special guest in the studio as well, I'll tell you about in the third hour.
[00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.375]  But let's go ahead and start plowing into it.
[00:13:46.936 --> 00:14:00.641]  Trump has put out a giant list on X and on True Social, with lists and links to the videos and text, with gotta be over 100 names of prominent Democrats calling for violence and calling for his death.
[00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:06.172]  They've got some new statements that dovetails with Hillary and her attack on free speech.
[00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.173]  This is true totalitarianism.
[00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:19.037]  This is a true group, just like in Venezuela or places like Brazil, where they steal elections, get into power, and then never have another free election and outlaw their opposition.
[00:14:20.898 --> 00:14:22.059]  So here's the new compilation.
[00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:23.659]  We've had our own, but Trump put one out.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.702]  And here's the new Trump ad exposing him.
[00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:37.308]  If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be?
[00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:41.330]  Does one of us have to come out alive?
[00:14:45.432 --> 00:14:48.234]  Chris always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[00:14:48.814 --> 00:14:51.196]  No, I wish during high school I could take him behind the gym.
[00:14:54.005 --> 00:14:54.445]  I said, no.
[00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:58.268]  I said, if we were in high school, I'd take you behind the gym and beat the hell out of them.
[00:14:58.468 --> 00:15:01.510]  I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country.
[00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.390]  Maybe there will be.
[00:15:02.831 --> 00:15:10.736]  That you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[00:15:10.896 --> 00:15:21.843]  If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.
[00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:25.244]  And you push back on them!
[00:15:25.264 --> 00:15:27.304]  And you tell them they're not welcome!
[00:15:27.624 --> 00:15:31.245]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our lives.
[00:15:31.525 --> 00:15:32.945]  Enemies of the state.
[00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:36.566]  President Walker, how do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?
[00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:38.286]  When they go low, we kick them.
[00:15:39.187 --> 00:15:39.747]  Please!
[00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:42.687]  Get up in the face of some Congress people!
[00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:43.808]  Yes!
[00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:49.569]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:59.140]  Of all the Democrats in the party of violence, Trump vans 2024.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.661]  Now that's a good ad, but it's not even hardcore.
[00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:06.843]  I mean, I've got senators saying we've got to take this guy out.
[00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:15.286]  I've got the former section chief of the CIA that ran assassination operations, Phil Mudd, saying the government's going to kill this guy, CIA's going to kill this guy.
[00:16:17.066 --> 00:16:19.707]  I mean, I've got the Lincoln Project saying we're going to put a bullet in him.
[00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:23.348]  So guys, take Trump's ad.
[00:16:23.388 --> 00:16:24.529]  McBrain, take Trump's ad.
[00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:26.508]  Don't add too much.
[00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:31.191]  Just add another minute of them saying they're going to kill Trump.
[00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:33.912]  Because it's, I mean, I don't know why they put that out.
[00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.534]  That's really milquetoast compared to what they're doing.
[00:16:37.214 --> 00:16:41.236]  And then add the new clip where the woman says on MSNBC, we need to shoot Trump.
[00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:41.976]  Yesterday.
[00:16:42.777 --> 00:16:44.237]  So add the Phil Mudd.
[00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.660]  The senator saying we're going to eliminate Trump.
[00:16:51.181 --> 00:16:54.543]  Schumer saying we got six ways for Sunday to get him.
[00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:57.552]  And then the new lady, like I said, saying, shoot Trump.
[00:16:57.592 --> 00:17:06.264]  And then repost that and then say, this is the ad exposing Democrats calling for violence that Trump should have put out.
[00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:08.067]  We're just here to help.
[00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:10.415]  But I get it.
[00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:17.820]  I mean, Trump's got campaign people that are somewhat politically informed and have their nose somewhat at the grindstone, but not like us and not like our audience.
[00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:20.882]  We do this seven days a week, all day, all night.
[00:17:21.643 --> 00:17:22.503]  This is what we do.
[00:17:23.124 --> 00:17:28.007]  And that's why InfoWars is there, and that's why you're there to boost the signal and augment what we do.
[00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:33.431]  Without you being excited, without you being engaged, without you doing what you do,
[00:17:35.069 --> 00:17:36.209]  We have almost no power.
[00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:37.089]  You're everything.
[00:17:37.129 --> 00:17:39.910]  That's when you call in thanking me, I'm like, uh, excuse me?
[00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.190]  Thank yourself.
[00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.111]  You're the answer.
[00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:44.011]  You're the Paul Revere.
[00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:44.711]  You're the resistance.
[00:17:44.771 --> 00:17:49.292]  I'll say this before I go back to these clips and the new clips and Hillary calling for arresting Trump supporters en masse.
[00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:50.392]  Bombshell stuff.
[00:17:53.733 --> 00:17:55.113]  Keep your word of mouth going.
[00:17:55.153 --> 00:17:55.993]  Keep your prayer going.
[00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:59.334]  Please, I humbly ask you for your aid and comfort in this fight.
[00:17:59.654 --> 00:18:00.334]  And I'll say it again.
[00:18:02.094 --> 00:18:06.737]  No organization or group out there is as hardcore and over the target as InfoWars.
[00:18:06.757 --> 00:18:14.001]  There are other great prominent people that reach even more, that do fabulous jobs, but they will say InfoWars is overall the brain trust.
[00:18:15.902 --> 00:18:17.803]  I'm not going to list all the names.
[00:18:17.903 --> 00:18:18.744]  It's not about bragging.
[00:18:18.784 --> 00:18:19.424]  It's about a fact.
[00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:20.865]  They've all said it on air.
[00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:21.966]  They've said it to me in person.
[00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.151]  Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, all of them.
[00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:28.674]  Even Glenn Beck's like, yeah, you're pointing the way in a great way.
[00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:31.857]  That's our guests, that's myself, that's the crew, that's the callers.
[00:18:32.197 --> 00:18:33.899]  We are the most immersed, we are the most focused.

[00:20:28.334 --> 00:20:29.275]  I can't do it without you.

[00:20:37.182 --> 00:20:38.303]  Are you going to support what we're doing?
[00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:43.228]  The tip of the spear for your own future, your children's own future, or are you going to just say, I'll let somebody else do it?
[00:20:43.448 --> 00:20:43.948]  I need your help.
[00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:44.989]  Plus, these are great products.
[00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.530]  Go now.
[00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.874]  TheAlexJonesStore.com, InfoWarsTore.com, drjonesandactuals.com.
[00:20:50.154 --> 00:20:52.577]  The links are all up at RealAlexJones on X and at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:53.157 --> 00:20:53.438]  All right.
[00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:57.501]  30 plus great ball caps, you name it, all limited edition.
[00:20:59.043 --> 00:21:00.044]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:00.805]  All right.
[00:21:01.874 --> 00:21:08.140]  Now, just going back and going through this, I just played you Trump's new ad, that I'll give a B+.
[00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:10.843]  I'm not bitching, I'm just saying, that's what you got?
[00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:12.224]  That's nothing!
[00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:16.569]  We've got 10-minute compilations of them saying, kill Trump.
[00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:19.752]  You've already seen them probably 20 times, you're a regular listener.
[00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:21.574]  We'll keep reposting them to Axe.
[00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.451]  But I've got a whole bunch of new clips just yesterday, and them calling for our mass arrest.
[00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:43.197]  When they start openly saying, yeah, we're going to ban all your semi-autos, and yeah, we're going to take your guns, and yeah, we're going to cut your children's genitals off, and yeah, we're going to start World War III, and we're going to put you in jail for your speech, these people mean business.
[00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:47.210]  You can say, well, I'll just roll over, keep my head down.
[00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.971]  We'll be enslaved for sure.
[00:21:49.712 --> 00:21:51.113]  And Trump said it a thousand times.
[00:21:51.173 --> 00:21:52.333]  I've said it a thousand times.
[00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:54.655]  Everybody's starting to get it because it's so true.
[00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:59.417]  They're not trying to get through Trump just because they hate Trump.
[00:21:59.457 --> 00:22:00.358]  They want to get to you.
[00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:02.219]  They're not going after Trump.
[00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:03.000]  He's standing in the way.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.300]  They're not going after Alex Jones.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.101]  I'm standing in the way.
[00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:13.486]  You are the target of cutting off your energy and coming after your bodily autonomy with poison shots and coming after your kid's future.
[00:22:14.383 --> 00:22:17.045]  And destroying your dollar and starting World War III.
[00:22:17.426 --> 00:22:20.048]  These are megalomaniacs, and you're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:22:20.068 --> 00:22:22.871]  Well, you're not like them, so it sounds crazy, but look at history.
[00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:24.492]  This happens over and over again.
[00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:26.474]  It's happening again on steroids.
[00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:38.664]  They're just a short clip from a two-and-a-half-minute compilation we put out of them calling for Trump's death and violence yesterday, that we're going to add this and a few other clips to Trump's ad and re-upload it with the headline,
[00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:46.176]  Is the Trump campaign ad condemning Democrats or this exact headline.
[00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:50.361]  This is the campaign.
[00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:57.087]  This is the Trump campaign ad condemning Democrat calls for violence that Trump should have put out.
[00:22:58.209 --> 00:22:59.250]  It'll just be his ad.
[00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:02.594]  Hell, make it a minute longer.
[00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:03.394]  Just not too long.
[00:23:03.414 --> 00:23:05.496]  I know there's too much with them saying, we're going to kill him.
[00:23:05.516 --> 00:23:07.438]  We're going to take him out.
[00:23:07.518 --> 00:23:10.240]  We're going to, there's a bunch of clips that we haven't even found.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:15.684]  I saw last year where they were on MSNBC, CNN saying, we're going to demolish and annihilate his supporters.
[00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:17.065]  We're going to burn them down.
[00:23:17.246 --> 00:23:17.846]  These are quotes.
[00:23:18.206 --> 00:23:19.728]  We're going to take out his supporters.
[00:23:20.888 --> 00:23:22.169]  We ought to find those clips and add them.
[00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:29.655]  But, but, but just to that clip, just add the six ways of Sunday to get us, the CIA is going to kill Trump.
[00:23:30.638 --> 00:23:34.581]  Shoot Trump, and then the senator saying we're going to eliminate Trump.
[00:23:36.022 --> 00:23:37.123]  That's only four or five clips.
[00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:38.224]  Add those, put that up.
[00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:40.566]  And then the clip's hardcore.
[00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.267]  Then it's a 99.
[00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:45.770]  The reason it's a 99 is we can make it longer and put all the rest of the crap in there.
[00:23:46.151 --> 00:23:48.232]  And again, listeners can find this at my crew camp.
[00:23:48.252 --> 00:23:50.054]  They're great, but they're limited because there's only a few of them.
[00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:56.079]  There's a bunch of clips of them saying we're going to burn down the Trump supporters, we're going to destroy MAGA, we're going to outlaw MAGA.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.281]  We're going to demolish them.
[00:24:01.462 --> 00:24:02.602]  We're going to destroy them.
[00:24:02.662 --> 00:24:03.623]  We're going to arrest them.
[00:24:03.863 --> 00:24:06.624]  We need to use Homeland Security like we did on Al Qaeda.
[00:24:07.064 --> 00:24:10.706]  That was a CIA guy on CNN and MSNBC, went on both last year.
[00:24:11.466 --> 00:24:15.188]  We need to outlaw MAGA and use Homeland Security against all Trump supporters.
[00:24:15.468 --> 00:24:26.313]  I mean, again, just like in a year, I'll say, if we're still on air, remember when Hillary said she wants to outlaw questioning them and put anybody they say is a disinformation person in jail?
[00:24:27.677 --> 00:24:28.877]  And they'll be like, yeah, she did say that.
[00:24:28.897 --> 00:24:29.398]  Where's the clip?
[00:24:29.418 --> 00:24:30.378]  Well, she said it yesterday.
[00:24:30.398 --> 00:24:31.038]  We've got the clip.
[00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:31.718]  I just played it earlier.
[00:24:31.738 --> 00:24:32.339]  We'll play it again.
[00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:36.900]  But I mean, this is crazy town level garbage.
[00:24:40.402 --> 00:24:41.202]  So play the short clip.
[00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:48.488]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:24:48.588 --> 00:24:54.812]  He is destructive to our democracy, uh, and he has to be, uh, he has to be eliminated.
[00:24:54.832 --> 00:24:56.193]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:24:56.473 --> 00:24:58.975]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:01.577]  There you go!
[00:25:03.238 --> 00:25:04.378]  So I got a bunch of other clips.
[00:25:04.398 --> 00:25:05.659]  Let's start going to them before the break.
[00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:07.641]  I'm gonna come back with the big enchilada on P. Diddy.
[00:25:08.281 --> 00:25:11.003]  Uh, go ahead and play clip one, seven, and eight.
[00:25:13.093 --> 00:25:13.701]  Back to back.
[00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:19.072]  ...boosting Trump back in 2016.
[00:25:19.532 --> 00:25:26.255]  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:37.921]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better... He has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.
[00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:42.843]  And the bottom line is that you can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter.
[00:25:43.403 --> 00:25:52.069]  The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power.
[00:25:52.769 --> 00:26:01.374]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:02.675]  And that has to stop.
[00:26:04.637 --> 00:26:11.461]  Even if we were to have a resounding blue wave come through, as many of us would like,
[00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:17.770]  Putting it all back together again, after we've gone through this MAGA nightmare.
[00:26:19.434 --> 00:26:21.298]  And re-educating, basically.
[00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:23.142]  That sounds like a rather...
[00:26:25.552 --> 00:26:28.814]  A re-education camp, I don't think we really want to call it that.
[00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:48.606]  I'm sure we can find another way to... Having Trump not only have had the codes, but now having the classified information for Americans and being able to put that out and share it in his resort with anyone and everyone who comes through should be terrifying to all Americans and he needs to be stopped.
[00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:54.769]  And the donor class can't just sit back on the sidelines and say, oh, well, don't worry, this will all work itself out.
[00:26:55.189 --> 00:26:58.331]  They're still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a fact.
[00:27:00.052 --> 00:27:00.952]  Would you like more clips?
[00:27:00.972 --> 00:27:01.693]  We've got more.
[00:27:01.713 --> 00:27:04.194]  I mean, these are some bad people.
[00:27:05.034 --> 00:27:06.895]  Lock you up if they say it's disinfo.
[00:27:07.155 --> 00:27:08.796]  They're the biggest liars we've ever witnessed.
[00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:09.657]  All they do is lie.
[00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:15.300]  Hillary Clinton's mouth's a giant stinking sewer, but she is honest about wanting to put you in a death camp.
[00:27:16.766 --> 00:27:17.447]  We'll be right back!
[00:27:17.827 --> 00:27:22.834]  Stay with us at fullwars.com for its last show, banned-out video, and real Alex Jones on X. Are you following me?
[00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:23.515]  You should!
[00:27:24.417 --> 00:27:30.039]  Now, a lot of you will recognize this bad boy because it was a limited edition bestseller years ago.
[00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:33.641]  We've updated it and brought it back due to your demanding it.
[00:27:33.981 --> 00:27:35.401]  And it is a conservation shirt.
[00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:37.002]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:27:37.482 --> 00:27:43.984]  Atrazine's literally sterilizing and killing frog populations and bending the gender of our young boys and giving our girls cancer.
[00:27:44.025 --> 00:27:45.785]  So this is a real conservation shirt.
[00:27:45.805 --> 00:27:52.788]  You can serve our operation, keep us on air, and stand up for amphibian life that are being poisoned by the chemicals that are turning the frogs gay.
[00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:57.925]  I love this shirt as well, because the left's always acting like they're the mavericks.
[00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.245]  They're the trailblazers.
[00:27:59.306 --> 00:28:00.006]  They're the outlaws.
[00:28:00.626 --> 00:28:03.988]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are the rebels against the globalists.
[00:28:04.468 --> 00:28:05.349]  We are the resistance.
[00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:07.650]  And I'm voting for the outlaw.
[00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:16.955]  Fight the tyrants at point blank range and meet like-minded people and spread the word in the third dimension.
[00:28:17.255 --> 00:28:19.976]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[00:28:20.156 --> 00:28:21.257]  TheAlexJonesStore.com
[00:28:24.477 --> 00:28:31.341]  Broadcasting worldwide from the BattleSkarden and BattleInfoWars headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:31.421 --> 00:28:31.962]  Yorder.
[00:28:32.822 --> 00:28:35.504]  We were supposed to be off the air a long time ago.
[00:28:35.524 --> 00:28:39.347]  The New World Order threw a lot at us, but they're not all powerful.
[00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:43.889]  And their control is slipping through their fingers.
[00:28:47.352 --> 00:28:47.632]  Most
[00:28:48.996 --> 00:28:59.665]  Rebels against tyranny in history die or are in prison for the rest of their lives long before they ever get to see the defeat of the tyrants they're up against.
[00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:07.551]  But I can look at the numbers from every angle and I can study the facts and I can see it in my mind and soul and feel it in my gut.
[00:29:09.512 --> 00:29:12.535]  If we continue to move against the enemy with the truth,
[00:29:13.871 --> 00:29:26.715]  And if those of us on the front lines and the tip of the spear don't falter and don't back down and trust in God, we will defeat this current permutation of the New World Order.
[00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:38.279]  Now, the corruption, the technology, the way it's being deployed, there's a lot of big fights coming up, but this particular group going for everything right now is hitting some major speed bumps.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.681]  And that's how the world works.
[00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:43.502]  It's an endless battle between good versus evil.
[00:29:43.722 --> 00:29:50.606]  And when you decide that you can't defeat evil and that you should just roll over to it, it races through the body politic and takes over.
[00:29:53.047 --> 00:30:01.591]  When we resist, we find the greatest attributes in humanity and we can literally empower ourselves and do incredible things and reach and touch the stars.
[00:30:02.852 --> 00:30:03.132]  All right.
[00:30:04.613 --> 00:30:08.395]  This P. Diddy thing is massive, to say the least.
[00:30:09.352 --> 00:30:25.016]  Now, just like with P. Diddy, we see the same thing with Epstein, where he had billionaires, some of the top fashion designers, British intelligence, CIA, Mossad, massive connections to him.
[00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:32.378]  And he wasn't just getting underage girls and things for elites to have sex with and be compromised, knowingly to be in the club.
[00:30:33.539 --> 00:30:37.980]  And the owner of Atlantic Monthly is heavily involved in it currently and been currently involved in the past.
[00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:39.995]  Not just currently.
[00:30:42.356 --> 00:30:47.757]  But he's just one tentacle or one head of the Hydra.
[00:30:49.578 --> 00:30:54.279]  And P. Diddy, it's come out, the FBI was aware of this for over a decade.
[00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:57.000]  They turned a blind eye to it.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.521]  He's a super Democrat, a massive supporter of their system.
[00:31:02.728 --> 00:31:23.739]  And now all these lawsuits, and all these witnesses, and all this evidence, and the raids last year, and this year, are pointing the finger in the indictment that I have a copy of right here and a read over, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, the same district that came out two weeks ago and said that it's all political against Trump.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.780]  It's the most powerful in the U.S.
[00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:27.561]  D.C.'
[00:31:27.501 --> 00:31:28.502]  's the second most powerful.
[00:31:29.938 --> 00:31:31.459]  They're the ones that do the dirty work.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.861]  So, P. Diddy isn't Epstein.
[00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:55.159]  P. Diddy is just the manager, or the bag man, in a major industrial-level operation in the Caribbean, in Florida, in Los Angeles, at these big mansions with hidden cameras, where they have these, quote, freak parties for decades, where politicians, Democrats and others, but mainly Democrats, go
[00:31:56.434 --> 00:32:09.184]  And have sex with underage girls, boys, rape people, they get drugged, and most of the people going know they're going to be compromised to be in the club, and then they get recruited into doing things for the intelligence agency.
[00:32:09.204 --> 00:32:13.187]  So the big question is, why is this being done now?
[00:32:13.227 --> 00:32:15.969]  And will P. Diddy end up dying in prison like Jeffrey Epstein?
[00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:25.476]  And are the feds rolling this up now because they're ready to apply more pressure on the Democrats to follow their orders, or they'll be outed?
[00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:30.458]  Like the Lincoln Project people and one of their folks, and you know what happened to him.
[00:32:31.438 --> 00:32:33.239]  That's why they're such anti-Trump people.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.200]  That's why they're calling for, you know, Trump to have a bullet put in him.
[00:32:39.221 --> 00:32:41.421]  So, this is a control system.
[00:32:41.962 --> 00:32:44.182]  There's no doubt it's run by the intelligence agencies.
[00:32:44.943 --> 00:32:47.943]  Going back to Hoover with his famous blackmail system.
[00:32:48.744 --> 00:32:49.384]  Jerry Hoover.
[00:32:52.168 --> 00:32:54.209]  So the question is, why is this being done now?
[00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:56.971]  Why did they roll up Harvey Weinstein?
[00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:59.653]  Well, that then puts pressure on Oprah Winfrey and others.
[00:32:59.953 --> 00:33:04.296]  She was heavily involved in the women, both delivering them and reportedly using them.
[00:33:04.856 --> 00:33:06.717]  She's seen more tail than a toilet seat.
[00:33:07.858 --> 00:33:10.440]  Her herself was a sex slave as a child, she admits.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.161]  They've checked the record, she was.
[00:33:13.622 --> 00:33:15.203]  So, this is very sick.
[00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:19.333]  This is the currency in which these globalists traffic.
[00:33:20.114 --> 00:33:23.636]  Here they traffic drugs, they traffic stolen art, water money.
[00:33:24.977 --> 00:33:33.382]  But really, those are a close second when you get to the heart of the evil of the trafficking of children, and now the trafficking of dead children's organs.
[00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:44.045]  All the rest of the things you see coming out of Gaza and coming out of Ukraine, Western governments, whether it's Israel or whether it's Ukraine or whether it's the U.S., whether it's the British, they're all involved.
[00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:46.627]  The Communist Chinese, of course, are doing it all as well.
[00:33:46.687 --> 00:33:48.207]  It's just whatever's evil, they're doing it.
[00:33:48.968 --> 00:33:51.129]  And we're a bit naive out here not understanding it.
[00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:55.011]  So Ian Carroll, who's on with us Thursday, always does a great job.
[00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:57.892]  We heard one of his reports yesterday on the CIA connections.
[00:33:58.132 --> 00:34:03.595]  They're massive and total, basically, on Ryan Wesley Roth, the
[00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:09.590]  Would be assassin of Trump Sunday in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.
[00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.774]  Well, the new report, he does a better job than I would summing it up quickly with the documents.
[00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:16.595]  So here he is bringing it up.
[00:34:16.615 --> 00:34:22.199]  But notice, Implicated is the top record executive at the number one record company in the world.
[00:34:22.299 --> 00:34:29.625]  Over a third of the hit songs for decades, every year, including Taylor Swift, all of it, is this guy.
[00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:31.907]  And this is how they keep control.
[00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:34.742]  And they drug people.
[00:34:34.782 --> 00:34:35.682]  They get them on ecstasy.
[00:34:35.702 --> 00:34:38.244]  They get them on cocktails of ecstasy and alcohol and other drugs.
[00:34:39.265 --> 00:34:40.466]  And then, boom, you wake up.
[00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:42.327]  Hey, did you know you had sex with a 14-year-old?
[00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:43.388]  Don't worry.
[00:34:43.428 --> 00:34:44.028]  We'll protect you.
[00:34:44.068 --> 00:34:44.688]  We'll take care of you.
[00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:45.429]  But we got the video.
[00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.650]  We're your friends.
[00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:51.313]  So, this is how they do it.
[00:34:52.794 --> 00:35:00.139]  And one time, I was at a birthday party of a very well-known musician.
[00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:05.031]  Household name here in Austin.
[00:35:05.051 --> 00:35:05.812]  I was invited to it.
[00:35:05.832 --> 00:35:09.417]  It was like 10, 12 years ago, 11 years ago.
[00:35:09.437 --> 00:35:13.221]  And we're at this nice room.
[00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:14.963]  They had separated a nice restaurant.
[00:35:16.545 --> 00:35:19.789]  And there was another, not this guy, but another very famous record executive.
[00:35:21.687 --> 00:35:23.408]  And I didn't really pay attention to it, I didn't care.
[00:35:23.948 --> 00:35:28.850]  There was some big famous folks there, not just who I was with, but some other big household names.
[00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:39.015]  And we ate for about two hours and then we're leaving and the record executive, big old tall guy, had a super smoking blonde wife and two other smoking hot blondes with him.
[00:35:40.136 --> 00:35:45.258]  And he goes, hey, we got the penthouse across the street, the hotel, go up there, drink with us and party.
[00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:50.480]  And I wasn't really putting two and two together.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.881]  It was only about nine o'clock at night.
[00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:53.242]  We've been at the restaurant since about seven.
[00:35:53.982 --> 00:35:54.702]  I said, sure.
[00:35:55.783 --> 00:35:59.904]  And the well-known rock star grabbed my arm and he goes, no, Alex, you're not going to that.
[00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:02.766]  And I go, what do you mean?
[00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:07.128]  And he goes, just trust me.
[00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:07.648]  I said, no.
[00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:12.490]  And later, I talked to him years later and he goes, yeah, you don't want to go up there.
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.471]  And I go, what do you mean?
[00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:20.814]  Well, obviously, you know, you like dudes?
[00:36:22.575 --> 00:36:23.356]  Because he likes you.
[00:36:23.376 --> 00:36:28.421]  I was like, oh, I mean, I literally go up and have a drink and talk or something.
[00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:32.845]  I was not just like, because I mean, I'm thinking I'm a talk show host, radio host, dude.
[00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:36.713]  You know, but the women are like, oh, yeah, because I was kind of halfway.
[00:36:36.753 --> 00:36:38.974]  Well, but a little devil on my shoulder.
[00:36:39.014 --> 00:36:42.156]  But the point is, who knows what would have gone on there?
[00:36:43.217 --> 00:36:45.098]  And that's how Hollywood is the whole thing.
[00:36:45.138 --> 00:36:47.059]  I've been in Hollywood parties with A-list people.
[00:36:47.779 --> 00:36:51.541]  When I used to go out there to be on TV shows and stuff and movies, I haven't been out there.
[00:36:51.882 --> 00:36:54.983]  I went out there about eight years ago and stayed with some folks, but I haven't since then.
[00:36:55.003 --> 00:36:57.185]  It's been about 15 years since I went on a regular basis.
[00:36:57.705 --> 00:36:58.886]  And I mean, I could count.
[00:37:00.202 --> 00:37:01.683]  Take more than two hands to count the times.
[00:37:02.723 --> 00:37:04.324]  Two hands and fingers, more than ten times.
[00:37:05.865 --> 00:37:09.106]  All these smoking hot chicks show up, you know, ten o'clock at night for dinner.
[00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:11.748]  Their chef's making food, it's great.
[00:37:11.768 --> 00:37:13.929]  You're on your back with a huge pool overlooking the Hollywood Hills.
[00:37:13.949 --> 00:37:24.054]  And I go, hey, um, usually it's one of the assistants who goes, hey Alex, uh... This happened a couple times, like... You notice these girls are pretty young, don't they?
[00:37:24.674 --> 00:37:25.975]  If you're not, you probably need to leave.
[00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:27.956]  I was like, yeah, what's going on?
[00:37:29.324 --> 00:37:30.245]  Those girls do look like they're about 16.
[00:37:30.685 --> 00:37:35.169]  Now, that's just the entry door into this.
[00:37:35.189 --> 00:37:37.471]  All right?
[00:37:38.832 --> 00:37:42.015]  And in fairness, people are like, hey, let me drive you back to your hotel.
[00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:44.377]  You don't want to be here.
[00:37:45.759 --> 00:37:49.842]  Because I'm there about, you know, like a movie, or you make a documentary, and I'm there trying to do business.
[00:37:50.703 --> 00:37:53.025]  It's like, well, dinner's over, and the business is over.
[00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:54.807]  So now there's other business.
[00:37:55.677 --> 00:38:06.042]  And a few times I stayed a little later, when that stuff hadn't been said, and it was the other thing, literally guys walk in with briefcases, just like Harvey Weinstein's briefcase, he got photographed on a plane, he opens it up with all these drugs, like, what do you want?
[00:38:06.722 --> 00:38:07.602]  There's everything there.
[00:38:08.243 --> 00:38:14.626]  Heroin, morphine, ecstasy, speed, all sorts of marijuana, pills, just, and I'm like, I don't want any of that.
[00:38:16.266 --> 00:38:17.807]  My third martini is quite good.
[00:38:18.347 --> 00:38:19.188]  Can somebody drive me home?
[00:38:20.655 --> 00:38:29.925]  It's everywhere, and I've had major musicians on that have talked about, they're like 16, 17, they've got a hit record, they get invited, they get marched into a room, and there's a bunch of naked women having sex with old men in robes, and they're like, hey, join the club.
[00:38:30.786 --> 00:38:32.648]  This is par for the course, people.
[00:38:33.929 --> 00:38:35.911]  And I was smart enough to say, goodbye.
[00:38:37.473 --> 00:38:39.195]  And then literally just stop returning the phone calls.
[00:38:39.655 --> 00:38:41.277]  And then I'd get calls, hey, you wanna come?
[00:38:41.938 --> 00:38:42.859]  You know, oh man.
[00:38:43.965 --> 00:38:47.629]  One time I got invited to a big record studio in California for the weekend.
[00:38:47.649 --> 00:38:49.010]  They were going to fly me out there in a private jet.
[00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.591]  One of the last times I said no.
[00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:53.254]  Nice people, big, top, top rock band.
[00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:57.678]  You'd be like, oh wow, that's like in the top ten ever.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.382]  And I got invited out.
[00:39:02.402 --> 00:39:03.644]  They were telling me how real this stuff is.
[00:39:03.984 --> 00:39:05.746]  And I said, no, no, I'm just too busy.
[00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:20.225]  And then it was years later I read about a very well-known person I really like who was there recording one of her records and it was at that recording studio at that time with those people and I would have got a chance to meet her and play her music here on the show.
[00:39:20.245 --> 00:39:21.327]  I'm sure she's a wonderful person.
[00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:24.049]  She does songs about Kim Trails and the New World Order.
[00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:30.674]  Uh, in the last few years, but I was like, I would have gone to be around her because I, you know, I'm married then I wouldn't do anything.
[00:39:30.694 --> 00:39:32.515]  I'm sure she wouldn't either, but I got a crush on her.
[00:39:33.456 --> 00:39:35.317]  Uh, so that's how this is.
[00:39:35.377 --> 00:39:39.460]  It's very, very alluring, very alluring.
[00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:42.202]  And that's how they get control of people.
[00:39:42.262 --> 00:39:47.546]  So this information is coming out right now because the deep state's really applying the blackmail.
[00:39:47.786 --> 00:39:49.888]  They just blew their whole own blackmail operations.
[00:39:49.908 --> 00:39:51.389]  They can control it so they can.
[00:39:53.032 --> 00:39:53.972]  Parallel construct.
[00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:54.973]  They already have all the stuff.
[00:39:55.013 --> 00:39:56.194]  They already got the dirt themselves.
[00:39:56.214 --> 00:40:02.617]  Now they have to act like this investigation is discovering it so they can put pressure on the thousands of people that went and were part of these sex parties.
[00:40:02.997 --> 00:40:07.119]  And again, a lot of them that's come out in the indictment didn't want to have sex with 15-year-old girls that were drugged.
[00:40:07.759 --> 00:40:09.060]  A lot of them already big stars.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.321]  You were having sex with stars.
[00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:14.443]  Who they're priming up to be sex operatives.
[00:40:15.203 --> 00:40:17.424]  CIA, FBI, it's all one group at that level.
[00:40:19.525 --> 00:40:20.786]  A lot of it's homosexual sex.
[00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.891]  A lot of it is that to compromise people.
[00:40:26.911 --> 00:40:29.732]  A lot of people are like, no, I don't want to have sex with a dude.
[00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:31.232]  We're really going to trust you then.
[00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:36.574]  So like the Mexican mafia or MS-13 or whatever, or even the Italian mafia, you got to kill people.
[00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:37.854]  You got to do what you're told.
[00:40:37.934 --> 00:40:39.314]  So they trust you because they got dirt on you.
[00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:40.395]  You got to make your bones.
[00:40:41.475 --> 00:40:43.556]  As they say in the Godfather, I'm all green.
[00:40:43.576 --> 00:40:47.797]  I made my bones when you were banging cheerleaders.
[00:40:50.703 --> 00:40:54.405]  And so that's in the old gang world.
[00:40:54.425 --> 00:40:56.445]  But that's not enough today with the globalists.
[00:40:56.465 --> 00:40:58.686]  You got to do crimes with children.
[00:40:58.726 --> 00:40:59.887]  And it gets younger and younger.
[00:40:59.907 --> 00:41:02.027]  And finally, this 10-year-old's causing us a problem.
[00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:05.369]  Go in there and strangle her or him or all your information comes out.
[00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:07.490]  And this has come out in a lot.
[00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.551]  I mean, they'll literally march guys in their FBI-style suits, but they're not the FBI.
[00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:15.993]  But it's like, they're like, listen, you son of a bitch, you go kill that kid right now or we'll kill you.
[00:41:16.773 --> 00:41:18.134]  They'll punch you right in the face.
[00:41:19.224 --> 00:41:21.428]  So that's how they're controlling everybody.
[00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.856]  And you need to grow up, folks, and realize that's how this is operating.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.065]  All right, let's go ahead and play Ian Carroll's powerful report.
[00:41:31.803 --> 00:41:33.584]  Well, tonight, they arrested P. Diddy.
[00:41:33.844 --> 00:41:36.965]  News just broke that they took him into custody in New York City.
[00:41:37.245 --> 00:41:44.328]  So I figured now is as good a time as any to shit all over Sean again and remind everyone just how horrible this man is.
[00:41:44.788 --> 00:41:53.152]  So if you haven't read the court documents and done any of the other research on this guy, this producer he worked with named Lil Rod brought this lawsuit against him.
[00:41:53.712 --> 00:42:05.936]  Rodney Jones v. Sean Combs alleging RICO allegations, which is like organized crime, and he alleged that a member of this RICO organization was none other than the CEO of Universal Music Group, Lucian Grange.
[00:42:06.416 --> 00:42:11.697]  Universal Music Group produced one-third of the top 100 songs last year, including Taylor Swift.
[00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:16.699]  Quote, while living and traveling with Mr. Combs, Mr. Jones discovered that
[00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:17.359]  Thank you.
[00:42:32.096 --> 00:42:32.596]  We're good to go.
[00:42:57.825 --> 00:42:59.986]  Well, the diddler just got touched.
[00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:03.467]  But don't worry, I'm not gonna drop that spice and then not give you more details.
[00:43:03.767 --> 00:43:09.708]  So Diddy was big on recording all kinds of things, and he frequently took this guy's phone from him and recorded things at parties.
[00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:19.051]  So this dude wound up with hundreds of hours of footage and audio recordings of Mr. Combs, his staff, and his guests engaging in serious illegal activity.
[00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:20.512]  On his own cell phone.
[00:43:20.972 --> 00:43:26.118]  Including the acquisition, use, distribution of XC, cocaine, GHB, ketamine, marijuana, and mushrooms.
[00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:29.061]  The displaying and distribution of unregistered illegal firearms.
[00:43:29.882 --> 00:43:36.168]  Combs providing laced alcoholic beverages to minors and sex workers at his homes in California, New York, the Virgin Islands, and Florida.
[00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:37.950]  Yes, those Virgin Islands.
[00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.374]  Diddy's brother, Christian, drugging and sexually assaulting a woman.
[00:43:43.095 --> 00:43:47.497]  Mr. Combs detailing how he planned to leverage his relationship with Bishop T.D.
[00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:55.261]  Jakes to soften the impact of his public image of Cassie Ventura's lawsuit, which is horrendous, and I'm not going to read from it.
[00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:56.602]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[00:43:56.862 --> 00:43:57.902]  This guy's a piece of shit.
[00:43:58.282 --> 00:43:59.623]  Actor Cuba Gooding Jr.
[00:43:59.863 --> 00:44:05.046]  Yes, that actor, Cuba Gooding Jr., sexually harassing and assaulting Mr. Jones.
[00:44:05.446 --> 00:44:07.167]  Yes, here are photos of Cuba.
[00:44:07.927 --> 00:44:08.627]  Doing the things.
[00:44:09.067 --> 00:44:11.168]  Here's more photos of Cuba Gooding Jr.
[00:44:11.388 --> 00:44:12.389]  trying to fuck this guy.
[00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:22.372]  Quote, forcibly touching Mr. Jones, fondling Mr. Jones' leg, his upper inner thighs, and his groin, the small of his back, near his buttocks and his shoulders.
[00:44:23.013 --> 00:44:25.614]  Jones rejected his advances and Mr. Gooding Jr.
[00:44:25.634 --> 00:44:28.515]  did not stop until Mr. Jones forcibly pushed him away.
[00:44:29.295 --> 00:44:30.575]  The following is a screenshot.
[00:44:30.996 --> 00:44:41.579]  Homie witnessed a shooting where either Diddy or his brother shot a dude in the bathroom and then got the cops to just totally not prosecute, not investigate, say it was a drive-by.
[00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:42.459]  They drove away.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:56.944]  But what Diddy's scheme was all about was getting rappers to do gay stuff on camera, though they did not know it, so that he had blackmail on them so that he could kind of control them and thereby control the whole music industry that he had kind of helped create.
[00:44:57.224 --> 00:44:58.585]  And to be fair, I mean, like,
[00:45:00.185 --> 00:45:05.026]  I mean, maybe he saw some signs that maybe it would work, but apparently, Homie wasn't having it.
[00:45:05.586 --> 00:45:06.607]  Sorry, I'm just making jokes.
[00:45:07.307 --> 00:45:15.249]  Quote, Mr. Combs, Diddy, went so far as to share a video of Stevie J anally penetrating a Caucasian male without a condom.
[00:45:15.529 --> 00:45:20.070]  This was done to ease Mr. Jones's anxiety concerning homosexuality.
[00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:23.851]  According to Diddy, this is a normal practice in the music industry.
[00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:25.692]  Look, even Stevie J is doing it.
[00:45:26.232 --> 00:45:42.451]  Diddy informed Mr. Jones that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with rapper Redacted, R&B singer Redacted, and Stevie J. Yes, Diddy's having gay multi-gay orgies and using it to try to get homie to have more gay orgies because that's what he's all about.
[00:45:43.152 --> 00:45:49.756]  Mr. Combs promised to make sure that Mr. Jones wins producer of the year at the Grammys if he did gay stuff.
[00:45:50.216 --> 00:46:02.864]  So A, Diddy is claiming that he has the power and leverage to get some random dude to win producer of the year at the Grammys and he's leveraging that to get gay sex.
[00:46:03.684 --> 00:46:05.446]  And blackmail from that gay sex.
[00:46:05.886 --> 00:46:20.360]  Diddy's assistant, defendant Coram, required all employees from the butler, the chef, to the housekeepers to walk around with a pouch or fanny pack filled with cocaine, GHB, ecstasy, marijuana, gummies, toochie, mixture of ecstasy and cocaine.
[00:46:21.149 --> 00:46:21.729]  At all times.
[00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:25.230]  So that Diddy could get high anywhere and everywhere.
[00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.910]  And yes, Homeboy has photos of all of it.
[00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:48.415]  Diddy maintained this Rico enterprise by using threats of violence, threatening to eat his face, displaying and distributing guns and plaintiffs present, bragging about having law enforcement under control, bragging about murdering people, and bragging about bribing witnesses and jurors in the criminal case concerning the 1999 New York City nightclub shooting with Shine.
[00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:50.516]  Are you getting the picture yet?
[00:46:50.876 --> 00:47:06.640]  And it would appear that one of the ways that he had law enforcement under control was through his chief of security, Fahim Muhammad, who the whole staff was allegedly told to contact if anything ever went wrong with police or law enforcement, and he would be the fixer that would make it all disappear.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.583]  Well, Fahim Muhammad is the former head of security for Michael Jackson.
[00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:19.707]  This kid had just graduated college with, like, a business degree, and he became the head of security for the King of Pop at age 21 or 22.
[00:47:19.908 --> 00:47:24.150]  And then, whoopsies, that same year, head of Pop died.
[00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.971]  This guy was second on the scene.
[00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:35.657]  And then his very next job, after failing, was to become the head of Diddy's entire operation.
[00:47:36.547 --> 00:47:43.572]  Think about it, the head of security in a blackmail ring needs to know all the dirt, otherwise he's not securing shit.
[00:47:44.072 --> 00:47:58.663]  Diddy formed his record label in the first place with a lot of help, basically being selected by Clive Davis, who's got a lot of mob ties and other stuff in his history, but he's been running huge portions of the music industry before we were all born.
[00:47:58.763 --> 00:48:04.307]  We're talking back to signing names originally like Janis Joplin, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, Earth, Wind & Fire.
[00:48:04.707 --> 00:48:05.948]  I say all of that to just
[00:48:06.588 --> 00:48:10.489]  Show you the scope that this is not just one rapper doing bad things.
[00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:12.990]  This is the whole music industry.
[00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.090]  This is how it runs.
[00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.211]  Diddy is not an isolated incident.
[00:48:18.031 --> 00:48:19.892]  He is the status quo.
[00:48:20.252 --> 00:48:24.613]  And chances are he was not the only blackmail ring operating in the music industry.
[00:48:25.253 --> 00:48:26.573]  We'll go into that another time.
[00:48:26.993 --> 00:48:34.015]  If you want more details about the Michael Jackson rabbit hole, Candace Owens produced one of the best videos I have ever seen about Michael Jackson.
[00:48:34.115 --> 00:48:35.616]  It's a work of art.
[00:48:36.136 --> 00:48:37.136]  Definitely watch it.
[00:48:37.496 --> 00:48:47.419]  I cannot imagine how you would watch that video and not come away realizing that, holy shit, Michael Jackson was framed, all of the charges were bullshit, the FBI investigated him, they found nothing.
[00:48:47.859 --> 00:48:55.966]  Everyone close to him said that he never did anything to kids, and the only people that accused him of that clearly were standing to gain things from making false accusations.
[00:48:56.426 --> 00:48:57.347]  Go watch the video.
[00:48:57.627 --> 00:49:05.214]  Huge props to Lil Rod for having the guts to bring the lawsuit that eventually has now brought Diddy down, or at least gotten him into behind bars.
[00:49:05.594 --> 00:49:12.260]  This dude had every indication that he would get killed for doing that, and certainly that he would get blacklisted from the whole music industry.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.381]  Props, bro.
[00:49:13.761 --> 00:49:15.823]  And thanks to 50 Cent or whoever else,
[00:49:16.443 --> 00:49:24.237]  helped protect him and bring these charges whatever whoever else was got his back good job guys as for this piece of shit
[00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:27.782]  He's not gonna last very long.
[00:49:28.042 --> 00:49:29.862]  He's gonna squeal like a fucking pig.
[00:49:30.662 --> 00:49:33.123]  And there's an awful lot of powerful people that cannot have that.
[00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:35.504]  So watch out for the Epstein treatment.
[00:49:36.204 --> 00:49:37.485]  Diddy did not kill himself.
[00:49:38.025 --> 00:49:47.188]  And I guarantee you that the FBI is not gonna be releasing all those tapes of all those celebrities and politicians and powerful executives that he has blackmail on.
[00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:49.648]  They're keeping that shit locked down.
[00:49:50.429 --> 00:49:51.469]  Cause that's how they do.
[00:49:51.929 --> 00:49:52.669]  Status quo.
[00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:54.110]  So key takeaways.
[00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.733]  All the music you listen to is fucking fake.
[00:49:59.373 --> 00:50:08.580]  They're promoting bad artists that they can blackmail so they can control them, so they can keep running their fucking scheme, and they can give you awful messaging.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.383]  Think about the messaging in all of the artists that people like Diddy have promoted.
[00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:17.467]  Guns, violence, hoes, drugs, that's not authentic.
[00:50:17.927 --> 00:50:21.310]  That's being promoted by a blackmail ring in the music industry.
[00:50:22.904 --> 00:50:28.825]  It's like if Jeffrey Epstein was the one choosing what music got produced so that he could perpetuate his schemes.
[00:50:29.246 --> 00:50:33.987]  That's what your top hits radio stations have been playing for your entire life.
[00:50:34.587 --> 00:50:38.268]  We're not talking about one rapper that did some bad shit.
[00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:44.029]  We're talking about a systemic issue that just got broadcast across national television.
[00:50:44.049 --> 00:50:47.190]  Now they're gonna try to cover it all up with everything they've got.
[00:50:48.055 --> 00:50:49.095]  Don't let them.
[00:50:49.555 --> 00:50:56.097]  That's right, and the same HBO producer that put out the fake Sandy Hook movie about me did the disinfo on Jackson, and I've studied it, I've looked at it.
[00:50:56.557 --> 00:51:11.021]  Jackson admittedly was heavily sex abused by his family, his father reportedly, in mind control, and then he had the mind of a child basically, and had all these kids like he was a little kid, and there was all these witnesses that he never touched any of them.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.703]  And that's basically what happened.
[00:51:15.444 --> 00:51:24.975]  So the very groups that are out there covering up the real stuff targeted Jackson, but he was totally screwed up and totally mentally ill.
[00:51:26.837 --> 00:51:26.998]  So.
[00:51:28.732 --> 00:51:34.494]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the reality, and they're rolling this up now to activate all their blackmail control.
[00:51:34.634 --> 00:51:36.254]  It's much worse than you even heard right there.
[00:51:36.974 --> 00:51:38.915]  Kyle Rittenhouse is coming up in studio.
[00:51:38.975 --> 00:51:41.656]  Can't wait to talk about all the stuff that's happening in the world with him.
[00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:51.459]  Please remember, we have great products that you really need and want, and it supports the broadcast, so I'm respectfully asking you to continue to support us, or we won't be on air.

[00:52:56.697 --> 00:53:00.806]  Some of these conspiracy theories have turned out to be true.
[00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.650]  Which ones?
[00:53:03.308 --> 00:53:26.527]  The Trump-Russia witch hunt, Jeffrey Epstein, JFK assassination, the misuse of the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the weapons of mass destruction, the war in Ukraine, the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipeline, the open border migration caravans, the climate change scam, Kim Trails, and HARP, and 9-11 being an inside job, and the Internet of Things surveillance grid, and PFAs, and chemicals in the water turning everyone gay, and the 2020 election being stolen, and January 6 being filled with undercover

[00:54:59.977 --> 00:55:02.499]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[00:55:09.618 --> 00:55:18.023]  God is real.
[00:55:20.865 --> 00:55:23.026]  God is great.
[00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:27.289]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:31.992]  I want all of you to hear me now.
[00:55:33.993 --> 00:55:37.095]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically
[00:55:39.443 --> 00:55:40.223]  Has just begun.
[00:55:40.243 --> 00:55:53.430]  And it is your choice, spiritually now, which side you're going to be on that will predestine your entire future throughout the universe.
[00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.192]  Earth is only the launch point.
[00:55:57.732 --> 00:55:58.933]  The eye has not seen.
[00:55:58.953 --> 00:56:01.934]  The ear has not heard.
[00:56:02.095 --> 00:56:06.477]  The mind has not conceived what God has in store for us.
[00:56:08.226 --> 00:56:08.907]  You can feel it.
[00:56:09.527 --> 00:56:10.408]  You can see it.
[00:56:10.468 --> 00:56:11.669]  You can touch it.
[00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:12.489]  You can taste it.
[00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:14.911]  You know it in your very bones.
[00:56:15.752 --> 00:56:16.733]  Heart of your soul.
[00:56:18.642 --> 00:56:22.984]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead, guide, and direct you.
[00:56:23.905 --> 00:56:25.906]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[00:56:26.186 --> 00:56:27.427]  Ask God to purify you.
[00:56:28.007 --> 00:56:31.228]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:40.733]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little G-God of this world.
[00:56:43.355 --> 00:56:43.955]  We are living
[00:56:45.052 --> 00:56:48.175]  In such an incredibly historical time right now.
[00:56:49.176 --> 00:57:02.388]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls, but it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.

[00:59:21.637 --> 00:59:22.378]  This is what I do.
[00:59:22.418 --> 00:59:24.380]  We've had such a huge effect together.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:37.795]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and encourage you now to go to thealexjonesstore.com and be sure to enter for the free truck and $10,000 and buy more product, support the broadcast and get entered five or ten times depending on the day each time you buy a product.

[00:59:46.421 --> 00:59:48.262]  It was four years ago in August.
[00:59:49.523 --> 00:59:59.730]  A mob dispatched by the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris was burning down buildings and attacking innocent people.
[01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:05.794]  Kyle Rittenhouse was there, chased by a mob of pedophiles and criminals.
[01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:17.649]  Defended his life and was found innocent by a jury of his peers for the outrage of the George Soros financed and protected mob.
[01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:21.292]  Kyle Rittenhouse is with us in studio.
[01:00:21.332 --> 01:00:22.753]  He's got a new book out.
[01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:27.137]  You can get Kyle Rittenhouse acquitted at RittenhouseBook.com.
[01:00:27.617 --> 01:00:28.297]  He's on exit.
[01:00:28.317 --> 01:00:34.642]  This is Kyle R. You should follow him there and he also works with the great folks at TexasGunRights.org.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.665]  So here we are with him today, and I've always wanted to meet you in person.
[01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.227]  It's great to have you here.
[01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:50.573]  I've had some of your lawyers, I think it was your mom, on the show, but it's great to have you here in person.
[01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:55.818]  So much to talk about, and you want to talk about the Trump second attempt at assassination, the first attempt at
[01:00:56.518 --> 01:00:58.039]  Alex, thank you for having me on the show.
[01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.933]  Well, congratulations on going through hell and other deep states after your law fair.
[01:01:29.613 --> 01:01:30.834]  Some of the same tactics have used on me.
[01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.136]  They're coming after you, but you're stronger than ever, and I see you everywhere.
[01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:35.578]  It's got to be an experience for you.
[01:01:35.618 --> 01:01:37.800]  So you're a polite guy, but I'm trying to give you the floor.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.621]  I'll talk the whole time.
[01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:52.311]  If you would go back to why you went out there that night, what happened, the trial, now what you've been through, and just what's it been like being a young man, very smart, very disciplined, and then now you're at Mar-a-Lago, now you're
[01:01:53.208 --> 01:02:02.499]  You know, all over the place, all over the world, a household name, an icon of self-defense and really control and defending yourself.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.642]  What has that learning experience been like?
[01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:08.647]  And then let's get into the assassination attempts on Trump and where you see this election in 48 days.
[01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:10.794]  Absolutely.
[01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:19.178]  So on August 25th of 2020, I was in downtown Kenosha providing first aid and putting out fires to this local business that asked me to be there.
[01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:28.921]  And then I was set up for an ambush and chased down and forced to defend myself and then politically persecuted for political reasons because this case was the
[01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:34.583]  Clearer than day with all the video evidence and the prosecutor still came after me.
[01:02:35.223 --> 01:02:36.264]  I was put on trial.
[01:02:36.284 --> 01:02:55.369]  I was held in jail for 87 days and I had to fight for my freedom back because the media portrayed me as guilty before I was before a verdict was even rendered and it's it's an unfortunate circumstance of what happened but I think it's really helped me in the long run with a lot of the advocacy work I've
[01:02:55.749 --> 01:02:56.429]  We're good to go.
[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:32.173]  What was it like in that trial and then when the not guilty verdict came out?
[01:03:33.294 --> 01:03:37.436]  Well, when the not guilty verdict came out, it was a huge stress relief.
[01:03:37.536 --> 01:03:38.737]  I was very nervous.
[01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:45.220]  We've seen a lot of these political trials to where the jury just was scared and they convicted based on emotion.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:53.204]  But I'm glad I got a jury that looked at the facts and the evidence because if I didn't, I'd be in prison right now and I'm thankful that they got it right.
[01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:54.660]  Absolutely.
[01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:58.026]  I mean, you welled up with tears when that happened.
[01:03:58.066 --> 01:03:59.048]  I would have done that too.
[01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:01.813]  I mean, they're trying to put you in jail for how many years for doing nothing?
[01:04:02.093 --> 01:04:02.915]  A life in prison.
[01:04:04.798 --> 01:04:06.060]  What was it like in that moment?
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.742]  What was the feeling?
[01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:19.730]  Before the verdict came out, before we went out to the courtroom, we got a call from the clerk that the verdict has been rendered, and the first thing I did was I went into the bathroom and I threw up.
[01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:21.331]  I was just nervous.
[01:04:21.351 --> 01:04:29.738]  I was scared because I was 18 at the time, and I didn't know what the future held when I walked into that room.
[01:04:29.898 --> 01:04:31.099]  I didn't know what the verdict was.
[01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:33.060]  Your life was on the line.
[01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:36.043]  And people wouldn't have been too nice to you in prison.
[01:04:36.283 --> 01:04:37.103]  No, they weren't enough.
[01:04:37.964 --> 01:04:42.247]  It was right then and there, like, they either found me innocent or guilty.
[01:04:42.288 --> 01:04:52.456]  I'm either getting put in handcuffs and going back to jail for the rest of my life, or I'm walking out of that courtroom, and thank God I got to walk out of that courtroom as a free man.
[01:04:52.476 --> 01:04:57.800]  Wow, and you might have had to sit there until Trump wins the election to be pardoned.
[01:04:58.988 --> 01:05:02.510]  Yeah, unfortunately, like, even if I was convicted... It was state.
[01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:12.857]  It was state, so I wouldn't be able to receive a pardon, and I guarantee if I was convicted, Governor Tony Evers, the Democrat-led state, would not issue a pardon.
[01:05:14.318 --> 01:05:20.642]  Most people know the story, the left's always misrepresented it, but I mean, these guys were saying, we're gonna kill you, chasing you around, some of them with guns.
[01:05:21.162 --> 01:05:24.965]  Yeah, the first guy who attempted to kill me, Joseph Rosenbaum,
[01:05:25.817 --> 01:05:28.079]  He, he threatened to kill me earlier in that night.
[01:05:28.139 --> 01:05:30.621]  He said, if I catch you alone, I'm going to effing kill you.
[01:05:32.563 --> 01:05:33.423]  Convicted pedophile?
[01:05:34.604 --> 01:05:34.844]  Yes.
[01:05:36.406 --> 01:05:38.067]  And then the other guys, tell us about them.
[01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:43.491]  Uh, well, um, the first guy who attacked me, he, he was a convicted pedophile.
[01:05:44.172 --> 01:05:49.876]  The second guy, um, he had domestic violence charges and a couple other things.
[01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:53.940]  And then the third guy, um, had like robbery charges.
[01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.331]  Burglarly charges.
[01:05:56.571 --> 01:06:01.814]  And why would they think running around attacking people's businesses in blue collar area is going to help anybody?
[01:06:03.295 --> 01:06:08.959]  What I've learned from the left is they will do anything they can to seek violence when they're not getting their way.
[01:06:09.019 --> 01:06:11.040]  We see it firsthand happening right now.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.364]  This time they're going to a whole new level of trying to assassinate President Trump.
[01:06:16.644 --> 01:06:22.728]  They're resorting to these levels of violence to try to push their own political narrative and not a lot of people are realizing that.
[01:06:23.823 --> 01:06:26.665]  I want to put on screen this Ryan Wesley Roth.
[01:06:26.765 --> 01:06:27.846]  I haven't talked enough about him.
[01:06:27.906 --> 01:06:28.547]  He wrote a book.
[01:06:28.627 --> 01:06:29.547]  I've now scanned over it.
[01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:30.628]  The crew's written articles about it.
[01:06:30.668 --> 01:06:31.769]  I didn't read the whole 300 pages.
[01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:33.110]  I read like 150.
[01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.532]  It's Nuclear War is so wonderful.
[01:06:35.652 --> 01:06:36.873]  It's time to purge the earth.
[01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:40.175]  Then we'll have one global society and all do what we're told.
[01:06:40.195 --> 01:06:42.457]  I give you permission to kill Trump.
[01:06:42.477 --> 01:06:43.418]  Somebody needs to kill him.
[01:06:43.818 --> 01:06:45.159]  He's on the FBI radar.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.242]  He then appears and pops in the woods and almost kills Trump.
[01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:57.129]  And he's got this loving fake liberal look, and he's in all these recruitment videos in Ukraine, saying it's so loving, it's so good.
[01:06:57.209 --> 01:06:59.271]  I mean, he really is a snapshot.
[01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:00.191]  These people are nuts.
[01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:02.814]  They're insane, but we're the insane ones, Alex.
[01:07:03.194 --> 01:07:03.414]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.614 --> 01:07:07.998]  I mean, you look at him, and he's just this skinny old dude.
[01:07:08.218 --> 01:07:12.422]  I personally would not take him as somebody who's going to go out and do this just looking at him.
[01:07:13.147 --> 01:07:13.848]  Total lap job.
[01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:18.052]  You have this guy who's sitting in the woods for, what was it, over 12 hours?
[01:07:18.092 --> 01:07:18.693]  Yes, now I know.
[01:07:19.733 --> 01:07:21.955]  With a pretty large rifle.
[01:07:22.075 --> 01:07:24.937]  And my question is, why did Secret Service not know about this?
[01:07:25.557 --> 01:07:27.699]  Who is trying to take him out?
[01:07:28.119 --> 01:07:29.000]  We know it's the Democrats.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.801]  Why aren't they patrolling those woods every hour?
[01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:35.265]  I know there's cameras at all of Trump's golf courses.
[01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:36.646]  I know there's a lot of surveillance.
[01:07:37.226 --> 01:07:40.008]  Why aren't they watching the CCTV and picking these things up?
[01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:42.710]  That's not an easy gun to conceal.
[01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.911]  It's a pretty large AK-47.
[01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:49.054]  Like, you're not putting that in a backpack very easily.
[01:07:49.314 --> 01:07:53.635]  Well, we're just blessed that Crooks and Roath were not Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:07:53.655 --> 01:07:57.877]  Of course, you wouldn't be shooting Trump anyways.
[01:07:57.917 --> 01:08:03.078]  The point is, what do you make of Crooks at 150 yards going for the head?
[01:08:03.118 --> 01:08:04.839]  Everybody knows you go for the torso.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.481]  Um, well, Secret Service failed on that.
[01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:10.962]  I think they said the roofs were too sloped or something.
[01:08:10.982 --> 01:08:12.903]  They're basically flat roofs.
[01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:15.545]  I put my dog on roofs more sloped than that.
[01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:23.149]  And now we know that, uh, he was the deputy director then, now the director, that Ronald Rowe was the one that basically ordered the stand down and said, nobody on that roof.
[01:08:23.489 --> 01:08:24.690]  He took particular control.
[01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.051]  And when the police said, let's sync our radios at standard, he didn't allow that.
[01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.453]  Why is he the director of the Secret Service right now?
[01:08:30.593 --> 01:08:33.014]  Because he's the guy that ran the stand down in Butler.
[01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:35.098]  That's insane.
[01:08:35.118 --> 01:08:36.380]  You've been rewarded well.
[01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:49.459]  The attempted assassination attempts on Trump are insane and it's quite funny that they've tried to take Trump out twice.
[01:08:52.243 --> 01:08:59.150]  And he has done, he's been, David attempted to assassinate him in just as many interviews that Kamala has done.
[01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:01.632]  I saw that meme and I'm like, that is very accurate.
[01:09:01.672 --> 01:09:02.052]  It's true.
[01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:04.655]  Did you see the new interview she did on a local Fox?
[01:09:04.715 --> 01:09:06.696]  I mean, she sounds an eight-year-old but speak better.
[01:09:07.257 --> 01:09:09.439]  My seven-year-old daughter is more well-spoken than Kamala Harris.
[01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:09.959]  I'm serious.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.280]  I bet.
[01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:13.543]  I've met toddlers.
[01:09:13.603 --> 01:09:18.107]  My good friend, he has a couple children and they speak better than Joe Biden and Kamala put together.
[01:09:18.747 --> 01:09:22.108]  But anybody can be Joe Biden, so it's not a high bar.
[01:09:22.348 --> 01:09:28.649]  I want to get back to the tip of the cessation to Trump and everything, but what is the process like in the last four years?
[01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:29.769]  You were 18 when this happened.
[01:09:30.089 --> 01:09:34.490]  You've gone through all this hell, but now you've been across the country, across the world.
[01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:40.491]  Did you ever imagine when you went out that night to just try to render first aid that you would go on this roller coaster?
[01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:41.952]  Absolutely not.
[01:09:42.752 --> 01:09:46.893]  I honestly, I don't have like an interest of being known.
[01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:47.873]  I never really did.
[01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:53.695]  But I'm using, like, my name for good, in a way.
[01:09:53.735 --> 01:10:04.283]  I'm advocating for the Second Amendment and trying to push for better politicians to get elected because, as we know in Texas, there's a lot of anti-gun rhinos.
[01:10:05.144 --> 01:10:07.686]  And that's been my focus, a lot of advocacy work.
[01:10:08.888 --> 01:10:15.529]  Well, we're glad to have you here in Texas because, as you know, we're close to going purple because the average Texan is like, we'll never be blue.
[01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:18.170]  They have no idea how close we are.
[01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:22.531]  It is terrifying, especially down in Austin.
[01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:26.632]  Austin is a very, very blue area with a service-funded D.A.
[01:10:26.672 --> 01:10:28.912]  and a police department that does absolutely nothing.
[01:10:28.972 --> 01:10:29.793]  It's very scary.
[01:10:30.373 --> 01:10:30.813]  The D.A.
[01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:31.953]  holds meetings.
[01:10:31.993 --> 01:10:32.493]  There's video.
[01:10:32.513 --> 01:10:34.194]  He played it where he calls people comrade.
[01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:34.934]  He isn't admitted.
[01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:35.834]  He's like, yeah, I'm a communist.
[01:10:35.854 --> 01:10:36.134]  Big deal.
[01:10:37.423 --> 01:10:39.505]  Yeah, Soros funder DA, they're proud of it.
[01:10:39.525 --> 01:10:40.946]  They're not even hiding it anymore.
[01:10:42.387 --> 01:10:49.153]  So Kyle, addressing the public out there about election 2024 and Trump, what's your message to America?
[01:10:49.213 --> 01:10:50.815]  What's your take on where our country is?
[01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:56.239]  Hillary Clinton, I'll play the clip in a moment, has come out and said, let's start arresting people for their free speech if we say it's disinfo.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.561]  I mean, they're really desperate.
[01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.345]  And I'm wondering what you think they're going to do with 48 days left of the election.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:03.668]  Absolutely.
[01:11:03.688 --> 01:11:10.029]  Well, if Kamala Harris is elected on November 5th, we're very quickly going to turn into a third world nation.
[01:11:10.069 --> 01:11:16.391]  We have them pledging to take away free speech, to jailing people for free speech, which we're already seeing.
[01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:28.673]  And then we have Kamala Harris, who pretty much pledged if Congress doesn't pass a gun control and assault weapons ban within the first hundred days of being in office, that she's going to do so by executive order.
[01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:30.674]  Of course, she lied about it in her debate.
[01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:38.821]  We need to make sure that Kamala is not re-elected and that President Trump is the next President of the United States.
[01:11:40.002 --> 01:11:45.366]  I played these clips last hour, but I'm going to play them for you and get your response to them.
[01:11:45.626 --> 01:11:47.988]  Let's play clip one.
[01:11:51.158 --> 01:11:52.200]  We're good to go.
[01:12:09.785 --> 01:12:19.131]  I mean, these people are calling for a hundred times more violence than I've ever heard Republicans do, and then they try to turn it around and say, we're calling for violence, or you're violent for defending yourself.
[01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:20.892]  That's their cardinal rule.
[01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:22.193]  Their ultimate sin is doing that.
[01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:26.656]  Here's Hillary and a few other top Democrats calling for criminalizing free speech.
[01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:27.497]  You're putting people in camps.
[01:12:28.217 --> 01:12:37.384]  Boosting Trump back in 2016, but I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[01:12:38.385 --> 01:12:47.351]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:49.693]  He has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.
[01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:54.617]  And the bottom line is that you can't say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter.
[01:12:55.157 --> 01:13:03.822]  The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power.
[01:13:04.522 --> 01:13:13.127]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[01:13:13.367 --> 01:13:14.428]  And that has to stop.
[01:13:16.409 --> 01:13:23.253]  Even if we were to have a resounding blue wave come through, as many of us would like,
[01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:33.038]  Putting it all back together again after we've gone through this MAGA nightmare and re-educating basically.
[01:13:33.738 --> 01:13:38.680]  That sounds like a re-education camp.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.601]  I don't think we really want to call it that.
[01:13:40.661 --> 01:13:42.522]  I'm sure we can find another way to
[01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:47.933]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[01:13:48.014 --> 01:13:54.257]  He is destructive to our democracy, uh, and he has to be, uh, he has to be eliminated.
[01:13:54.317 --> 01:13:55.617]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[01:13:55.918 --> 01:13:58.399]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.460]  I got a bunch of other clips that are new.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:07.904]  The Lincoln Project saying it, Congress people saying it, you saw senators say it, two senators say it, you just saw, um...
[01:14:08.951 --> 01:14:14.512]  You know, former CIA high-level operative Phil Mudsing, he goes on to say the CIA is going to kill Trump.
[01:14:15.672 --> 01:14:18.473]  Why do you think they're so arrogant and open about this, Kyle?
[01:14:20.633 --> 01:14:23.134]  Honestly, they're not even hiding it anymore.
[01:14:23.194 --> 01:14:28.915]  They're pushing their own agenda and saying, we're going to ban free speech, we're going to take your guns, we're going to do all of these things.
[01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:30.535]  And that's the left's narrative.
[01:14:30.575 --> 01:14:31.915]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:14:32.295 --> 01:14:34.476]  And I better be careful what I say about Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:34.496 --> 01:14:35.496]  I really like my life.
[01:14:37.284 --> 01:14:38.166]  We all know what she does.
[01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.194]  I know you've been a target of a lot of threats.
[01:14:44.492 --> 01:14:47.054]  I mean, if you want to get into that, how many threats have you gotten that you know of?
[01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:50.737]  I've had... I've had... I can't even keep track.
[01:14:50.797 --> 01:14:51.797]  It's in the thousands.
[01:14:51.957 --> 01:14:55.120]  I've had people text me that, I'm showing up to your house, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.943]  I had one very weird incident to where I did have a drone following me around.
[01:15:00.423 --> 01:15:05.847]  I thought it was my neighbor just flying a drone, but I got a text on Twitter, see any drones flying around your apartment recently?
[01:15:05.947 --> 01:15:07.028]  And it freaked me out.
[01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:07.808]  So...
[01:15:09.049 --> 01:15:10.429]  Those are the type of things I get.
[01:15:10.449 --> 01:15:12.610]  The ones you gotta watch, the ones that don't make the threats.
[01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.730]  Exactly.
[01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:15.510]  I agree with that wholeheartedly.
[01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:17.291]  Well, it's not like you're a soft target, though.
[01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:18.471]  No, no.
[01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:21.231]  I mean, I exercise my constitutional right to bear arms.
[01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:22.692]  Are you packing right now?
[01:15:23.332 --> 01:15:24.052]  No, not at all.
[01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:25.352]  What are you carrying?
[01:15:25.512 --> 01:15:26.312]  I carry a Glock 17.
[01:15:26.352 --> 01:15:27.253]  Can we see it?
[01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:33.694]  You ever do raffles for guns that you own?
[01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:34.874]  I guarantee you could raise a lot of money.
[01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:35.703]  Yeah.
[01:15:35.723 --> 01:15:37.784]  That's it?
[01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:38.605]  That's very pretty.
[01:15:38.745 --> 01:15:39.666]  One in the pipe, so.
[01:15:40.046 --> 01:15:40.586]  One in the pipe.
[01:15:41.907 --> 01:15:42.627]  Wow, that's nice.
[01:15:42.868 --> 01:15:44.088]  So you carry a little bit bigger one there.
[01:15:44.228 --> 01:15:44.869]  I do, I do.
[01:15:44.889 --> 01:15:46.210]  It has Surefire X300U on it.
[01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:48.151]  Put this right here.
[01:15:48.391 --> 01:15:51.753]  You know, they're heavy guns, but do you like the staccatos made here in Texas?
[01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:52.954]  Oh, I love the staccatos.
[01:15:52.994 --> 01:15:54.315]  I'm wearing a staccato hat right now.
[01:15:54.335 --> 01:15:55.516]  Oh, wow, I didn't even notice that.
[01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:55.836]  Yeah.
[01:15:56.276 --> 01:15:57.577]  Yeah, Staccato's a great company.
[01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:59.558]  It's actually one of my favorite firearms.
[01:15:59.838 --> 01:16:01.820]  Well, I mean, look, I'm a good shot with a rifle.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.320]  It used to be a great shot when I did more of it.
[01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:06.342]  I started getting those guns about six years ago, they got better and better.
[01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:19.207]  And I can sit there with their small, I forget the name of it, more compact, not super compact, but it's compact, 9mm, at 100 yards with 4-inch plates and just empty the whole magazine right into it.
[01:16:19.527 --> 01:16:20.928]  They're just butter smooth.
[01:16:21.108 --> 01:16:22.228]  Laser beam.
[01:16:22.428 --> 01:16:23.649]  Their guns are a cheat code.
[01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:24.849]  Yeah, they're not.
[01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:26.210]  Yeah, they're great.
[01:16:27.757 --> 01:16:28.397]  They're heavy too.
[01:16:28.657 --> 01:16:37.840]  Absolutely, but I have all these constant threats but then I have politicians that want to disarm me and disarm other Americans by making it to where I can't carry every day.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.961]  I have the right to, I have the right to live.
[01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:42.161]  You have the right to live.
[01:16:42.201 --> 01:16:50.844]  We have the right to protect ourselves and that is a sacred value that's also a biblical value that I don't think the government should impose any restrictions on.
[01:16:51.244 --> 01:16:55.967]  What happens when a madman comes into a store, a school, or your church?
[01:16:56.207 --> 01:16:59.649]  You are your first line of defense instead of waiting for law enforcement.
[01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:05.333]  You have the right to defend yourself and you have the right to carry a gun and have the best tools and ability to do so.
[01:17:11.911 --> 01:17:19.574]  95% of even their well trained officers and military in a situation like that by themselves, the mob, that you just showed real control and precision.
[01:17:19.954 --> 01:17:21.695]  What zone did you go into?
[01:17:22.235 --> 01:17:23.356]  And was it just instinctive?
[01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:25.236]  Or why were you so icy?
[01:17:25.657 --> 01:17:26.557]  I didn't want to die.
[01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:32.859]  The whole fear of if I don't get to the police line, they're gonna kill me.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:34.920]  And that was that was the biggest thing.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.661]  Describe it for us.
[01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:36.281]  People want to hear this.
[01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.531]  Well I was, I was scared.
[01:17:38.591 --> 01:18:00.989]  I was 17 years old at the time and I was being chased down by a mob of rioters who were threatening to kill me and calling for my execution after already being chased and attacked and having to defend myself once already and having being hit in the back of the head with skateboards and hard objects and getting knocked in the ground and kicked in the face was traumatic and
[01:18:01.923 --> 01:18:06.167]  Having to take another life isn't an easy thing that people don't realize.
[01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:10.630]  It's something that I do have to live with and essentially cope with.
[01:18:11.131 --> 01:18:14.934]  But I'm alive because I defended myself.
[01:18:15.074 --> 01:18:17.576]  I'm alive because a gun saved my life.
[01:18:18.637 --> 01:18:19.718]  How did it feel in the moment?
[01:18:21.139 --> 01:18:23.501]  Absolutely terrifying that I was about to die.
[01:18:23.521 --> 01:18:25.083]  I thought I was gonna die.
[01:18:25.563 --> 01:18:28.746]  As soon as I was on the ground, I was like, this is it.
[01:18:28.786 --> 01:18:29.927]  This is where they're gonna kill me.
[01:18:33.652 --> 01:18:34.752]  What about the aftermath?
[01:18:35.313 --> 01:18:36.373]  I mean, in the minutes after?
[01:18:36.393 --> 01:18:50.857]  I mean, now that you enjoyed killing those people or wounding the one guy, like Obi-Wan Kenobi just shooting the arm with the gun or whatever, there in the space bar, did you have some life force or survival instinct that at least said, like, a satisfied feeling?
[01:18:50.897 --> 01:18:52.758]  Not that you'd killed people, but that you'd lived?
[01:18:54.156 --> 01:18:59.720]  I'm happy to be alive, but it's not a fun thing to have to take another life.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.982]  It's very difficult, no matter where they fall or what they've done.
[01:19:03.002 --> 01:19:07.485]  I didn't know any of their backgrounds, but I had to do what I had to do to stay alive.
[01:19:08.146 --> 01:19:10.107]  And I wish I would never have had to kill somebody.
[01:19:10.147 --> 01:19:11.348]  It's not something I'm proud of.
[01:19:11.408 --> 01:19:13.170]  It's not something I hold joy over.
[01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:16.612]  It's something that I deal with on an everyday basis.
[01:19:16.652 --> 01:19:17.813]  It's something I struggle with.
[01:19:17.833 --> 01:19:18.373]  Sure, just be clear.
[01:19:18.773 --> 01:19:19.834]  It wasn't a trick question.
[01:19:19.934 --> 01:19:20.595]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:19:20.695 --> 01:19:23.076]  I've been mugged and attacked before, and you don't like it?
[01:19:23.797 --> 01:19:25.057]  Yeah, it was more just anxiety and stress for me.
[01:19:25.077 --> 01:19:27.018]  I do have senses of relief now, but I'm still going through it.
[01:19:27.038 --> 01:19:34.581]  I'm being sued in the Eastern District of Wisconsin for over $20 million, and that is just a constant reminder of everything that happened, and I'm just waiting for it to be over.
[01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:55.688]  Didn't he have a gun in his hand saying, I'm gonna kill you?
[01:19:55.949 --> 01:19:56.169]  He did.
[01:19:56.389 --> 01:19:58.770]  Um, the first guy was Joseph Rosenbaum.
[01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:02.112]  He threatened to kill me and he was trying to steal my weapon from me.
[01:20:02.152 --> 01:20:02.372]  Yeah.
[01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:07.755]  And then the second guy was Anthony Huber who bashed me in the back of the head with a skateboard.
[01:20:07.775 --> 01:20:12.237]  And the third guy was Gage Grosskreutz who pointed a Glock pistol in my face.
[01:20:12.857 --> 01:20:13.798]  And he's the one you shot in the arm?
[01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:14.218]  Yes.
[01:20:15.439 --> 01:20:17.980]  And so you showed restraint in the arm instead of the chest?
[01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:23.941]  Um, I mean, I only shot until they were no longer a threat.
[01:20:24.061 --> 01:20:28.103]  So, I fired and he wasn't a threat as he started to back away after I hit him.
[01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:29.543]  And he's the one suing you?
[01:20:30.124 --> 01:20:31.884]  Uh, him and the state of Anthony Huber.
[01:20:33.485 --> 01:20:33.965]  For what?
[01:20:35.126 --> 01:20:36.066]  Uh, a lot of things.
[01:20:36.146 --> 01:20:40.348]  One of them being conspiring with law enforcement to deprive them of their constitutional rights.
[01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:43.949]  A bunch of other random... It's, it's a slew of BS.
[01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:46.350]  Do you have a, do you have a right to chase somebody with a gun to the street?
[01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:47.231]  And, and, and, and...
[01:20:48.639 --> 01:20:50.142]  No, they don't have a right to do that.
[01:20:50.302 --> 01:20:53.648]  I'm actually countersuing Gage Grossgrewds for assault.
[01:20:54.269 --> 01:21:00.760]  Because what Gage Grossgrewds did when he put a gun in my face was textbook assault and attempted murder if you ask me, but...
[01:21:03.752 --> 01:21:08.113]  All right, I want to go to break, and I want to give you the floor, because I can ask a lot of questions, and I've seen you.
[01:21:08.133 --> 01:21:10.114]  You're really smart, but you're very calm and polite.
[01:21:10.234 --> 01:21:17.896]  I want you to be able to address the audience and just talk about Trump, the election, yourself, Second Amendment, Texas, where we are, Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:19.836]  Where is the best place for people to visit and get your book?
[01:21:20.116 --> 01:21:21.537]  Would that be Rittenhousebook.com?
[01:21:21.697 --> 01:21:22.017]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:22.757 --> 01:21:24.078]  Alright, writtenhousebook.com.
[01:21:24.578 --> 01:21:26.840]  You also are doing great work with texasgunrights.org.
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.741]  I see you all over the news and doing a great job.
[01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:30.542]  What do you do at texasgunrights.org?
[01:21:30.922 --> 01:21:32.984]  I'm the Outreach Director for Texas Gun Rights.
[01:21:33.444 --> 01:21:36.326]  I handle a lot of our industry relations and I really enjoy it.
[01:21:36.366 --> 01:21:39.668]  And I enjoy the gun advocacy portion of it.
[01:21:39.968 --> 01:21:42.890]  Going out to college campuses and speaking about gun rights.
[01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.652]  Because my biggest issue is campus carry.
[01:21:46.312 --> 01:21:49.514]  We have campus carry in Texas, but it's only if you have an LTC.
[01:21:49.634 --> 01:21:50.835]  I think we need to change that.
[01:21:51.215 --> 01:22:00.461]  Everybody should be able to carry a gun wherever you want, but I'll also travel the country and I'll go and speak at other schools and talk about the importance of arming a younger society.
[01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.141]  It's beautiful.
[01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:01.821]  It's beautiful.
[01:22:01.841 --> 01:22:02.082]  Stay there.
[01:22:02.102 --> 01:22:04.323]  By the way, you had sunglasses on on your cap.
[01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:05.283]  I didn't see the staccato.
[01:22:05.584 --> 01:22:07.725]  That wasn't like a sponsorship pre-deal.
[01:22:08.745 --> 01:22:11.167]  I was like, he goes, yeah, boom, takes the glasses off.
[01:22:11.387 --> 01:22:12.528]  That's like a TV ad.
[01:22:13.008 --> 01:22:13.468]  Yeah.
[01:22:13.608 --> 01:22:14.049]  All right.
[01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:16.290]  Hey, True Strangers Infection, stay with us.
[01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:20.272]  This bad boy is the number one seller at the alexjonesstore.com.
[01:22:20.512 --> 01:22:23.374]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:22:23.794 --> 01:22:24.415]  Folks love it.
[01:22:24.615 --> 01:22:25.015]  I love it.
[01:22:25.135 --> 01:22:32.680]  I love wearing this out in public and it also lets the globals to let us know we are standing up against them and we know who they serve and we know who we serve.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:43.046]  The black rock globalist controlled left from academia to the media is obsessed with bullying you into silence because their ideas are illegal and unpopular.
[01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:45.187]  And if you simply speak up, it's game over.
[01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:49.249]  So stop thinking it's just Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson or Donald Trump's gonna save the world.
[01:22:49.509 --> 01:22:50.530]  It's all of us together.
[01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.471]  And wearing t-shirts in public that promote freedom is key.
[01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:55.132]  It doesn't just show our enemies we're awake.
[01:22:55.533 --> 01:22:58.814]  Other people see it and realize how popular freedom is.
[01:22:59.235 --> 01:23:01.056]  So ladies and gentlemen, it's a win-win.
[01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:07.359]  Get great shirts at thealexshowstore.com, fund the operations, we fight the tyrants at point blank range, and
[01:23:07.759 --> 01:23:10.422]  Meet like-minded people and spread the word of the third dimension.
[01:23:10.722 --> 01:23:13.485]  Take action now and don't let the left silence you.
[01:23:13.645 --> 01:23:14.566]  TheAlexJonesStore.com
[01:23:16.693 --> 01:23:17.313]  I just had an idea.
[01:23:17.333 --> 01:23:21.655]  We could have the Gadsden flag with the rattlesnake and put your head on it and say, don't tread on Rittenhouse.
[01:23:22.556 --> 01:23:23.656]  I think I've seen that one.
[01:23:23.676 --> 01:23:24.217]  Oh, see?
[01:23:24.397 --> 01:23:25.097]  Everything's been done.
[01:23:25.137 --> 01:23:27.158]  Hey, you want to sell it on InfoWars, let me know.
[01:23:28.459 --> 01:23:30.340]  Kyle, listen, it's great to have you here.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.941]  You were great to go on Harrison's show.
[01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:35.942]  I want you to come back now that you're in Texas a lot, but we've got 30 minutes or 27 minutes left.
[01:23:36.723 --> 01:23:38.064]  You're hosting the show.
[01:23:38.084 --> 01:23:40.725]  I want to hear what Kyle Rittenhouse will say about everything.
[01:23:40.745 --> 01:23:41.545]  I know you've got a lot to say.
[01:23:42.065 --> 01:23:42.726]  Boom, take it away.
[01:23:43.306 --> 01:23:50.032]  Well, Alex, we have, like, we were talking earlier about this attempted assassination of Trump and this assassination attempt on Trump.
[01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:55.376]  And this is just, like I said earlier, this is like, this is how far the Democrats are willing to go.
[01:23:55.516 --> 01:23:56.617]  And it really scares me.
[01:23:56.677 --> 01:24:00.480]  What are they willing to do come November 5th on Election Day to American citizens?
[01:24:00.901 --> 01:24:02.902]  They're willing to try to take out the president.
[01:24:03.563 --> 01:24:08.267]  I have a feeling the Democrats have already talked about declaring martial law, and that scares me.
[01:24:10.644 --> 01:24:13.386]  How many people are really prepared for when this happens?
[01:24:13.586 --> 01:24:19.889]  How much of society is ready and willing to go and protect their family and bunker down?
[01:24:20.109 --> 01:24:21.909]  And I don't think a lot of people are.
[01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:28.292]  And what are people going to do when their phones are no longer working because everything gets shut down?
[01:24:28.432 --> 01:24:29.293]  And that scares me.
[01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:31.780]  Absolutely.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.362]  And sometimes we have some reporters that try and hide it.
[01:24:34.382 --> 01:24:35.443]  I saw a clip a couple days ago.
[01:24:35.463 --> 01:24:36.524]  I don't know where I saw it.
[01:24:36.544 --> 01:24:37.405]  I was just scrolling Instagram reels.
[01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:58.203]  And there's this reporter who said, we need to shoot, shoot, but stop Trump.
[01:24:58.223 --> 01:25:00.304]  She said, shoot, then stop right after.
[01:25:00.324 --> 01:25:01.205]  I don't know if you've seen that.
[01:25:01.225 --> 01:25:01.905]  Yeah, we have the clip.
[01:25:01.925 --> 01:25:05.368]  That's one of the spokespersons for Kamala Harris, one of her superdelegates.
[01:25:06.249 --> 01:25:06.929]  That's clip 10.
[01:25:07.489 --> 01:25:09.331]  That's a Stacey Plaskett play that.
[01:25:13.712 --> 01:25:31.305]  Having Trump not only have had the codes but now having the classified information for Americans and being able to put that out and share it in his resort with anyone and everyone who comes through should be terrifying to all Americans and he needs to be stopped.
[01:25:32.806 --> 01:25:33.867]  They're not even hiding it.
[01:25:33.887 --> 01:25:34.707]  She did that on purpose.
[01:25:34.887 --> 01:25:35.548]  Absolutely.
[01:25:35.928 --> 01:25:42.613]  And I have a feeling they release these blanketed statements now every time it happens, every time they try to take President Trump out and like
[01:25:43.817 --> 01:25:45.118]  I don't even know at this point.
[01:25:45.558 --> 01:25:48.721]  They are actively trying because they know they're losing.
[01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:55.886]  They know President Trump is going to be the next President of the United States, and they're trying to do everything they can to hold on to this power, and it's scary.
[01:25:55.906 --> 01:25:56.627]  I agree with you.
[01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:57.807]  He's going to win a landslide.
[01:25:58.088 --> 01:25:59.709]  Why does Carl Rittenhouse believe that?
[01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.421]  Well, look at all the evidence.
[01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:04.242]  Look at all the research there.
[01:26:05.102 --> 01:26:07.783]  I know a few Democrats who are voting for Donald Trump.
[01:26:08.303 --> 01:26:11.324]  People are tired of seeing this country and people are waking up.
[01:26:11.564 --> 01:26:12.925]  We had four great years.
[01:26:13.425 --> 01:26:20.967]  And so we had eight years of a Democrat Biden and Obama before that Obama and Biden before President Trump.
[01:26:21.007 --> 01:26:22.228]  And then we had Kamala.
[01:26:23.088 --> 01:26:26.371]  And Biden and Kamala, whoever's running the White House.
[01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:29.193]  No, it's not Joe Biden running this country.
[01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:32.336]  And President Trump said that says it great in his campaign.
[01:26:32.436 --> 01:26:36.139]  Ask ask yourself, were you better off four years ago than you are today?
[01:26:36.159 --> 01:26:38.341]  And absolutely, I was.
[01:26:38.701 --> 01:26:41.523]  I'm not paying a ridiculous amount for milk and eggs.
[01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.304]  Gas wasn't through the roof.
[01:26:43.645 --> 01:26:44.786]  There were more jobs.
[01:26:44.806 --> 01:26:45.846]  The economy was great.
[01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.469]  Trump started no new wars.
[01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:54.413]  We have wars starting every single day under the Biden administration.
[01:26:54.433 --> 01:27:00.999]  And I asked myself, is this a country that I want to bring children into with this administration?
[01:27:01.319 --> 01:27:02.180]  Absolutely not.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:13.289]  I want a country that is safe and protected, that we have our rights, and I don't have to worry that the government's going to implement a new war or turn us into communist China.
[01:27:14.639 --> 01:27:16.261]  And that's what the Democrats are really trying to do.
[01:27:16.301 --> 01:27:17.822]  You know, in 2000, they war-gamed it.
[01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:20.184]  The New York Times reported on John Podesta.
[01:27:20.204 --> 01:27:23.047]  They're doing the same thing now, saying if Trump gets elected, we won't accept it.
[01:27:23.627 --> 01:27:24.808]  We'll have our own swearing-in.
[01:27:24.828 --> 01:27:25.969]  We'll break the country up.
[01:27:26.009 --> 01:27:27.211]  And now they're saying civil war again.
[01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:29.112]  They're the ones doing this.
[01:27:29.212 --> 01:27:33.216]  And then pre-programming that Trump supporters are going to knock out the power with no evidence.
[01:27:33.276 --> 01:27:34.617]  I mean, they're getting ready for something big.
[01:27:34.637 --> 01:27:35.398]  I'm really concerned.
[01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:36.399]  And you're right.
[01:27:36.439 --> 01:27:38.161]  People better start discussing this.
[01:27:38.701 --> 01:27:39.142]  Right now.
[01:27:39.182 --> 01:27:40.783]  Attorney Generals better start talking about it.
[01:27:40.843 --> 01:27:48.790]  The states better be ready because the globalists are not planning to go because they know Trump has a duty to prosecute them for the crimes they've committed once he gets in.
[01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:49.571]  Absolutely.
[01:27:49.591 --> 01:27:57.157]  And I'm really looking forward to all of the people that are going to be held accountable for everything that they have done in the last four years.
[01:27:57.838 --> 01:28:04.624]  And it's going to be glorious to see actual real world consequences for people's actions.
[01:28:05.785 --> 01:28:17.234]  We see how they politically persecute Trump to try to silence him, but this is a man who has taken a bullet for this country, essentially, literally, and they're still coming after him.
[01:28:17.634 --> 01:28:21.177]  And they're persecuting him, but I think it needs to be, like,
[01:28:22.771 --> 01:28:24.412]  We need to start looking into the Democrats.
[01:28:24.572 --> 01:28:25.553]  Why are they coming after him?
[01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:26.914]  Why are they planting this information?
[01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:31.077]  But we also need to be charging them, because there is legitimate evidence of crimes.
[01:28:31.377 --> 01:28:32.038]  There are things.
[01:28:32.338 --> 01:28:34.740]  It's not vengeance, it's duty.
[01:28:36.681 --> 01:28:38.663]  They have to be prosecuted for the crimes they've committed.
[01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:39.563]  Absolutely.
[01:28:39.643 --> 01:28:40.864]  What about the 325,000 kids Senate report a month ago?
[01:28:43.366 --> 01:28:46.109]  Now missing, many of them in slave labor and sex slavery.
[01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:51.936]  Trump's talking about that, and Kamala helped do it, but he needs to point out they facilitated it.
[01:28:52.276 --> 01:28:54.499]  Full Moon of the Dead of the Night all around the country, it's still ongoing.
[01:28:54.519 --> 01:29:01.166]  I want Trump to pledge that he's going to have a task force to find the children and then prosecute the people that are trafficking them.
[01:29:02.187 --> 01:29:04.069]  And I think Trump will do that.
[01:29:05.114 --> 01:29:07.555]  I know the Biden-Harris administration won't.
[01:29:07.595 --> 01:29:08.615]  They're probably part of it.
[01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:09.235]  Oh, they are.
[01:29:10.056 --> 01:29:11.496]  And it's scary.
[01:29:11.796 --> 01:29:15.538]  I'm just really looking forward to this election happening.
[01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:24.300]  And I'm hopeful that it is overpowered, like we overpower the fraud and enough people actually get out and vote.
[01:29:24.521 --> 01:29:25.821]  Because I know some people are like,
[01:29:26.647 --> 01:29:27.948]  Nah, they're just going to steal the election.
[01:29:27.968 --> 01:29:29.608]  I'm just going to stay home and not waste my time.
[01:29:29.628 --> 01:29:37.731]  I always tell people, yes, they're going to try to steal, but if we overpower it and we make the fraud so obvious, they can't cheat.
[01:29:38.091 --> 01:29:39.572]  Well, and by the way, that's a fact.
[01:29:39.592 --> 01:29:40.912]  I've been on air 30 years.
[01:29:40.932 --> 01:29:47.875]  I've interviewed hundreds of election experts, read thousands of articles conservatively, and I've had all the top experts on.
[01:29:48.775 --> 01:29:54.019]  There's about 10% backed in with Zuckerberg's $450 million list he got, they've updated it.
[01:29:54.579 --> 01:29:57.181]  People that moved out of district, people that are dead and illegals.
[01:29:57.881 --> 01:30:04.106]  But states are expunging, like Texas, millions of names of people that moved out of state or dead or illegals.
[01:30:04.486 --> 01:30:05.186]  1.1 million so far.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:06.520]  Absolutely.
[01:30:22.368 --> 01:30:23.368]  And that's exactly why.
[01:30:23.408 --> 01:30:30.409]  And I don't think the attack we saw on Trump yesterday, the attempted assassination attempt, the second one is going to be the last.
[01:30:30.569 --> 01:30:33.790]  I think they're just going to keep trying, and I think they're going to keep doubling down.
[01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:35.170]  It really scares me.
[01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:39.331]  I really wish Trump would find a new security detail that is not Secret Service.
[01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:41.371]  I'll personally volunteer for free.
[01:30:41.431 --> 01:30:46.192]  I do not have those skills, but President Trump, I know some really well-trained guys.
[01:30:46.712 --> 01:30:47.152]  Let me know.
[01:30:48.012 --> 01:30:50.233]  Well, you can certainly patrol around the woods.
[01:30:51.153 --> 01:30:51.673]  Absolutely.
[01:30:51.693 --> 01:30:52.393]  Is there 12 hours?
[01:30:53.434 --> 01:30:56.375]  I don't understand how nobody noticed it.
[01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:04.437]  I want to know who leaked that Trump was at golfing because it was unannounced, unplanned.
[01:31:04.557 --> 01:31:14.820]  So I really want to know who put it out there that Donald Trump is going to be golfing and he's at the fifth hole and Donald Trump was at the fifth hole and the shooter was at the sixth hole.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.441]  How did he manage to get that close within
[01:31:18.502 --> 01:31:24.745]  What was it, 300, 350 yards for President Trump, and it's terrifying.
[01:31:26.406 --> 01:31:34.671]  Well, he was waiting on Trump, and if you expand on that, I'm not a military guy, or any of that, but I've researched history and how it works.
[01:31:34.751 --> 01:31:45.857]  The standard procedure for anything you want to guard, whether it's nuclear weapons or the President, is you patrol the perimeter, and there's a cyclone fence and woods around it, and then you've got, I mean,
[01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:52.914]  Ten people could be patrolling that in teams of two and have it checked every 20 minutes.
[01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:54.935]  Or, you know, dogs.
[01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.476]  I know Secret Service has canines.
[01:31:58.117 --> 01:32:00.738]  Dogs are really good at finding people in the woods.
[01:32:01.079 --> 01:32:05.341]  Go ahead and send a dog to do a sweep in the woods, see if they alert on somebody.
[01:32:05.361 --> 01:32:08.103]  They should be sweeping that whole perimeter every hour.
[01:32:09.064 --> 01:32:09.504]  I agree.
[01:32:09.564 --> 01:32:10.065]  Not even that.
[01:32:10.105 --> 01:32:11.786]  Every 30 minutes it should be checked.
[01:32:12.106 --> 01:32:15.609]  There should be somebody monitoring the CCTV 24-7.
[01:32:15.689 --> 01:32:17.431]  Especially when he's out on the golf course.
[01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:18.031]  Mm-hmm.
[01:32:18.192 --> 01:32:22.355]  And I personally think there should be a drone or a plane following him with infrared imaging.
[01:32:22.735 --> 01:32:23.256]  Absolutely.
[01:32:24.942 --> 01:32:25.823]  And they've got the money.
[01:32:25.903 --> 01:32:27.064]  I mean, a drone with infrared.
[01:32:27.384 --> 01:32:30.186]  Now they've gotten so inexpensive a big drone with infrared.
[01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:31.626]  A hundred grand?
[01:32:32.207 --> 01:32:33.227]  One that could stay up for hours.
[01:32:33.388 --> 01:32:35.689]  That's chump change to the Secret Service and the U.S.
[01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:36.129]  government.
[01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:37.350]  I mean, we're paying taxes.
[01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:38.811]  Where are our tax dollars going?
[01:32:38.931 --> 01:32:40.032]  And again, for those that don't know,
[01:32:41.206 --> 01:32:43.527]  With the infrared, no matter if it's night or day, it picks up heat.
[01:32:44.027 --> 01:32:48.609]  It just flies over and anybody in the woods stands out like a sore thumb and you just send people in.
[01:32:48.929 --> 01:33:04.594]  You know, this is very interesting that the FBI had a surveillance plane at the Black Lives Matter riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin during my shooting, but they couldn't have an infrared plane flying around whenever Trump is going to speak or whenever he's playing golf.
[01:33:05.095 --> 01:33:08.716]  And that's what the FBI admitted in a press conference two days ago and yesterday.
[01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:12.006]  Well, he's not the president, so he gets a small detail.
[01:33:12.428 --> 01:33:13.271]  He's the target!
[01:33:13.312 --> 01:33:14.256]  He was the president!
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.121]  And who makes that decision?
[01:33:16.141 --> 01:33:17.002]  Joe Biden.
[01:33:17.682 --> 01:33:18.002]  Absolutely.
[01:33:18.022 --> 01:33:20.965]  How many people have attempted to assassinate Joe Biden?
[01:33:21.465 --> 01:33:24.008]  How many people have attempted to assassinate Donald Trump?
[01:33:24.508 --> 01:33:26.249]  Who's the higher value target?
[01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:29.032]  And I'm glad you put it that way, because Elon Musk did that a few days ago.
[01:33:29.092 --> 01:33:31.954]  He said, why is no one trying to kill Kamala and Biden?
[01:33:31.994 --> 01:33:33.035]  He wasn't saying kill them.
[01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:34.496]  He was saying, because they're the deep state.
[01:33:34.837 --> 01:33:35.717]  The deep state's doing this.
[01:33:35.757 --> 01:33:36.598]  It's clear what he was saying.
[01:33:36.818 --> 01:33:37.959]  They said, oh, he's threatening them.
[01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.341]  No, he's saying no one wants to kill them because they're puppets.
[01:33:40.401 --> 01:33:41.983]  And no one should, and I don't want them to.
[01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:42.844]  Absolutely.
[01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:44.265]  Violence is never the answer.
[01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:47.008]  And that's what the left doesn't realize.
[01:33:47.168 --> 01:33:49.271]  They resort to violence when they lose.
[01:33:50.052 --> 01:34:00.744]  And unfortunately, we need to be prepared to counter that violence and be well protected and be able to protect ourselves and our families and go and train, go into the shooting range.
[01:34:01.104 --> 01:34:02.545]  Having a circle of friends.
[01:34:02.625 --> 01:34:08.648]  Me and Harrison, earlier on his show, talked about having like a community watch program which would be great to implement.
[01:34:08.688 --> 01:34:09.429]  Local gun club!
[01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:11.350]  Absolutely, a local gun club.
[01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:16.953]  Joining gun rights organizations like the National Association for Gun Rights or Texas Gun Rights.
[01:34:17.453 --> 01:34:24.278]  To help continue fighting for your rights so you don't end up having your guns taken away.
[01:34:24.298 --> 01:34:32.443]  And anybody that comes to your local gun club or your citizen watch group and wants to do violence, get their plates, track them back, they'll work for the ADL, so the Poverty Law Center or the Feds.
[01:34:33.264 --> 01:34:36.846]  And so, malicious in the Constitution, I love it, but they try to infiltrate things, calling it that.
[01:34:37.226 --> 01:34:46.473]  Call local civil defense, local neighborhood watch, have barbecues, go to the shooting range, teach safety, teach your neighbors how to shoot, how to shoot, and then just be like loving and healthy and happy.
[01:34:47.073 --> 01:34:48.234]  You don't even have to call it anything.
[01:34:48.914 --> 01:34:54.317]  I have a group of friends, and we train together, but we also go out on Saturdays and have beers together.
[01:34:54.337 --> 01:34:54.877]  That's great.
[01:34:55.037 --> 01:35:01.421]  So, like, we're a group of friends who care about each other and love each other, who will be there for each other if it needs to be.
[01:35:01.501 --> 01:35:03.442]  How proud is your family of you?
[01:35:04.462 --> 01:35:05.243]  Good.
[01:35:05.263 --> 01:35:05.703]  They're proud.
[01:35:06.683 --> 01:35:07.464]  Well, we're proud of you.
[01:35:07.644 --> 01:35:08.484]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:35:08.784 --> 01:35:13.347]  Tell us about your upbringing, your family, just your beliefs in general.
[01:35:14.127 --> 01:35:14.788]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:16.218 --> 01:35:23.282]  So I grew up in Antioch, Illinois in Kenosha, Wisconsin with a single mom, two sisters.
[01:35:24.283 --> 01:35:25.103]  And they're doing good.
[01:35:25.123 --> 01:35:28.225]  Yeah, so that's pretty much my upbringing.
[01:35:28.265 --> 01:35:29.305]  Just a small town.
[01:35:30.446 --> 01:35:35.769]  Dropped out of high school freshman year and ended up going back before my trial and finishing my high school degree.
[01:35:37.387 --> 01:35:39.429]  That was pretty much it for my upbringing.
[01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:40.351]  Not much.
[01:35:40.691 --> 01:35:41.492]  Middle class.
[01:35:42.473 --> 01:35:43.995]  Had a mom that worked a lot.
[01:35:44.496 --> 01:35:47.460]  And then you heard that a bunch of riots were coming.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.202]  They were already burning Minnesota down.
[01:35:49.522 --> 01:35:50.463]  What were you going to do?
[01:35:50.764 --> 01:35:52.186]  First day you said, I'm going to go out there tonight.
[01:35:52.799 --> 01:35:56.242]  Yeah, so, um... They also lied and said you'd traveled out of another state.
[01:35:56.282 --> 01:35:56.982]  No, you were from there.
[01:35:57.303 --> 01:35:58.163]  Yeah, that is correct.
[01:35:58.183 --> 01:36:00.145]  I actually shopped in Kenosha, ironically.
[01:36:00.165 --> 01:36:04.268]  Um, so I was in Kenosha, Wisconsin, because I worked there.
[01:36:04.288 --> 01:36:12.115]  I was a lifeguard at the RecPlex, and I had a shift the day before my shooting, and I got a call.
[01:36:12.415 --> 01:36:15.718]  I ended up staying the night at a friend's house, Dominic Black's house.
[01:36:16.858 --> 01:36:19.081]  And we were watching the videos, went to bed.
[01:36:19.101 --> 01:36:29.772]  On August 25th, we walked around downtown Kenosha and looked at all the damage and cleaned up graffiti and talked to some of these business owners.
[01:36:29.832 --> 01:36:38.941]  We met the minority-owned business owners of the car lots and they asked for our assistance in putting out fires and protecting the business.
[01:36:39.742 --> 01:36:46.649]  So we went down there, I brought my medical kit and my AR-15 and then that's why I was down there.
[01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:48.290]  That's what brought me there.
[01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:54.557]  I wonder why those guys were so dumb to chase somebody with an AR-15 saying I'm gonna kill you and pointing a gun at you.
[01:36:54.637 --> 01:36:55.798]  That doesn't sound very smart.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.865]  They wanted to kill somebody and I think they maybe thought that I was going to be an easy victim.
[01:37:04.335 --> 01:37:05.575]  What'd you make of the army sergeant?
[01:37:05.595 --> 01:37:06.116]  I forget his name.
[01:37:06.136 --> 01:37:08.377]  They got put in prison a few years, pardoned by the- Sergeant Daniel Perry?
[01:37:08.697 --> 01:37:09.897]  Yeah, pardoned by the governor, yeah.
[01:37:09.977 --> 01:37:10.577]  Yeah, sergeant.
[01:37:10.617 --> 01:37:11.638]  I mean, he's out there.
[01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:12.278]  They blocked the road.
[01:37:12.298 --> 01:37:15.379]  The guy comes and raises an AK-47 or MAC-90 at him.
[01:37:15.739 --> 01:37:16.800]  Well, what does he think's gonna happen?
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:17.600]  Absolutely.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.281]  So I actually know that case very well.
[01:37:20.281 --> 01:37:29.204]  I was, like, when he got convicted, I was advocating for him a lot, and thank God that the Board of Partner Paroles did the correct thing.
[01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:33.266]  It took them way too frickin' long, which really infuriated me.
[01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:53.221]  But Daniel Perry was a army sergeant who was doing Uber in downtown Austin when Garrett Foster, a man with an AK-47, walked up to his vehicle, pointed this AK-47 at him, and Daniel Perry pulled out his revolver and shot him five times in the chest and did exactly what he was trained to do and stop the threat.
[01:37:53.681 --> 01:37:55.082]  I mean, he was a veteran of Afghanistan.
[01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.143]  You don't want to mess with those guys.
[01:37:56.283 --> 01:37:56.883]  No, you don't.
[01:37:57.424 --> 01:37:58.825]  And Daniel Perry is a good man.
[01:37:58.905 --> 01:38:00.066]  He is a good person.
[01:38:00.766 --> 01:38:02.547]  And what he went through was unfortunate.
[01:38:02.567 --> 01:38:05.589]  And what he's still going through infuriates me.
[01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:13.075]  After being pardoned, I know he's struggling with certain things and it's just... I mean, you block a road and walk over to anybody and point a gun at them.
[01:38:13.975 --> 01:38:15.758]  I mean, what do you think we're supposed to do?
[01:38:15.998 --> 01:38:20.484]  Well, they want us to coward and, like, they want us to be the ones that just end up getting shot.
[01:38:20.524 --> 01:38:23.467]  They want us to be taken out, essentially.
[01:38:24.549 --> 01:38:25.910]  There was another MSNBC clipper.
[01:38:25.951 --> 01:38:28.654]  They said, Sunday, Trump had it coming to him.
[01:38:31.297 --> 01:38:32.239]  That is insane.
[01:38:33.965 --> 01:38:47.494]  It's the things we're saying, and I'm all for a free press and freedom of speech, but we definitely should start looking into a lot of these left-wing reporters that are saying to take out the president.
[01:38:47.595 --> 01:38:49.396]  That is inciting violence.
[01:38:49.856 --> 01:38:55.200]  But they investigate people for other freedom of speech issues that are on the other side of the spectrum.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.381]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:38:56.421 --> 01:38:59.323]  If you're a Republican, you're getting hit to the fullest extent of the law.
[01:38:59.363 --> 01:39:02.145]  If you're a Democrat, you can say whatever you want, and that's what I've learned.
[01:39:03.065 --> 01:39:03.365]  Absolutely.
[01:39:03.385 --> 01:39:08.827]  I've seen a lot of videos the last few years that the media tries to pick up on and say are racial, but it happened when white people, the media doesn't say that.
[01:39:09.327 --> 01:39:13.189]  I've seen crazy white people pull a gun out and point at cops, you know, out in the street and the cops shoot them.
[01:39:13.509 --> 01:39:19.551]  But I see these videos where black folks will pull a gun and point it, obviously wanting to have suicide by cop, the cops shoot them, they go, oh, it's racial.
[01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:20.731]  No, you're pointing a gun at people.
[01:39:21.091 --> 01:39:22.632]  Like, don't point a gun at somebody.
[01:39:22.812 --> 01:39:24.733]  If you call them a thug, you're racist.
[01:39:25.633 --> 01:39:26.373]  And it's ridiculous.
[01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:27.634]  You call them a thug or...
[01:39:28.414 --> 01:39:33.055]  That's an Indian word in India for a secret society of robbers and killers that would kill people.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.120]  We're good to go.
[01:40:08.584 --> 01:40:09.484]  I want to ask you a question.
[01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:12.406]  I want you to address the folks there, because you're a smart guy.
[01:40:12.426 --> 01:40:13.586]  I respect you, Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:40:13.606 --> 01:40:27.852]  What do you think would have happened two months and three days ago if Trump, if that bullet would have just been a half inch more towards the center to the left and would have hit Trump in the face and his head would have blown off on national TV?
[01:40:28.252 --> 01:40:29.833]  What do you think the left was planning to do?
[01:40:29.873 --> 01:40:30.753]  How are they going to manage that?
[01:40:33.934 --> 01:40:44.879]  I don't even really want to think about what would have happened because people call me insane all the time, but I think it would have sparked World War III, a civil war, if President Trump was taken out.
[01:40:44.899 --> 01:40:47.421]  That's something the left says they want.
[01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:47.941]  They're crazy.
[01:40:48.561 --> 01:40:55.865]  Absolutely, and I think they know that's what will cause it, and I just think it would have been chaos and a full-on war.
[01:41:00.126 --> 01:41:00.747]  Absolutely.
[01:41:02.028 --> 01:41:03.290]  There's still a good chance they're going to kill Trump.
[01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:04.251]  I'm not speaking into existence.
[01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:04.832]  I don't want it to happen.
[01:41:05.372 --> 01:41:07.855]  Are you concerned that he is too confident?
[01:41:08.376 --> 01:41:11.159]  I know he's got ice water in his veins and he has a sense of destiny.
[01:41:11.179 --> 01:41:15.184]  And Roger told me six, seven years ago, and I've talked Trump quite a bit too, but he said, Trump's very fatalistic.
[01:41:15.764 --> 01:41:18.347]  And by fatalistic, he has super confidence, but he doesn't care.
[01:41:19.408 --> 01:41:21.949]  Uh, I mean, he's just, the guy, it's not like an act with him.
[01:41:21.989 --> 01:41:23.470]  He just, he's so cool.
[01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:24.790]  It's almost too much.
[01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:26.371]  He just doesn't give a damn.
[01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:29.572]  Uh, what people think or say and like, it's just fearless.
[01:41:30.192 --> 01:41:33.373]  And I get, I'm fearless too, but I have fear that I'm going to let them get me.
[01:41:33.893 --> 01:41:35.414]  So I catch myself not caring.
[01:41:35.674 --> 01:41:38.215]  Sometimes I go, I better be, I better care because I'm important.
[01:41:39.422 --> 01:41:39.782]  Is that right?
[01:41:58.131 --> 01:41:59.852]  Absolutely, and that is what I want running this country.
[01:41:59.892 --> 01:42:03.273]  I don't want somebody who can barely get out of bed and can't even walk up the steps of an airplane.
[01:42:03.313 --> 01:42:04.953]  Maybe that's the protocol they were taking.
[01:42:04.973 --> 01:42:08.054]  They were gauging the slope on the steps for the roof for Secret Service.
[01:42:23.499 --> 01:42:24.701]  I haven't read that report yet.
[01:42:24.741 --> 01:42:27.705]  I would love to come back on and talk about it after I do read the report.
[01:42:39.841 --> 01:42:47.885]  And if they're covering this up, which I'm sure they are, this is insane, and I just want to see, I actually want to see punishments for those involved.
[01:42:48.005 --> 01:42:55.409]  I want to see people getting held accountable for their actions and their roles in this, and that is something that I don't think I'm going to see, but I hope I do.
[01:42:56.949 --> 01:42:57.810]  I totally agree.
[01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:03.793]  We've only got a few minutes left, so after you leave I'll have a thousand questions, but what else do you want to tell the public?
[01:43:08.812 --> 01:43:11.673]  So I talked a little bit about what I do for work.
[01:43:11.713 --> 01:43:13.814]  So I'm the Outreach Director for Texas Gun Rights.
[01:43:14.114 --> 01:43:21.957]  And if you're based in Texas and you're looking for a good gun rights group to join, we're the largest no-compromise gun rights group in the state of Texas.
[01:43:22.898 --> 01:43:27.279]  We're helping get good people elected and we're fighting for the Second Amendment.
[01:43:27.299 --> 01:43:29.340]  We're advocating people on the Second Amendment.
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:35.643]  And we're pushing and trying to protect bad gun bills from getting introduced and squashing bad gun bills.
[01:43:36.023 --> 01:43:37.844]  So you can join us at TexasGunRights.org.
[01:43:39.383 --> 01:43:40.924]  That's TexasGunRights.org.
[01:43:41.204 --> 01:43:42.085]  Tell us about the book.
[01:43:42.825 --> 01:43:43.185]  Absolutely.
[01:43:43.226 --> 01:43:45.327]  So, Acquitted is a story.
[01:43:46.388 --> 01:43:47.889]  It's a tell-all story, essentially.
[01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:53.812]  We go into everything that happened, and it's just a breakdown of my entire story, my entire life.
[01:43:54.593 --> 01:43:58.535]  My favorite part of it is the book is dedicated to my dog, Milo.
[01:43:58.876 --> 01:43:59.536]  Who's right here?
[01:43:59.576 --> 01:44:00.337]  Can we get Milo up?
[01:44:00.757 --> 01:44:01.657]  Yeah, I can get Milo up.
[01:44:02.698 --> 01:44:04.739]  We've had dogs on the table for it.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:06.521]  Come on, sweetheart.
[01:44:06.541 --> 01:44:06.921]  Boy or girl?
[01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:10.231]  Was it a gold retriever?
[01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.272]  There you go.
[01:44:14.073 --> 01:44:17.915]  You can get him in your lap if you want to.
[01:44:18.675 --> 01:44:19.775]  How old's your baby there?
[01:44:22.056 --> 01:44:24.437]  Milo is going to be four on November 2nd.
[01:44:24.818 --> 01:44:26.578]  So you got him right after all this started?
[01:44:26.638 --> 01:44:27.439]  I did, I did.
[01:44:27.939 --> 01:44:30.140]  So he's been with me through the entire trial.
[01:44:31.581 --> 01:44:32.661]  Looks like Joe Rogan's dog.
[01:44:33.061 --> 01:44:35.282]  Yeah, I love Joe Rogan's dog.
[01:44:36.183 --> 01:44:36.563]  Cool dog.
[01:44:37.864 --> 01:44:38.505]  He's a good boy.
[01:44:38.565 --> 01:44:39.745]  He needs a haircut right now.
[01:44:39.765 --> 01:44:40.706]  You need to look at the camera.
[01:44:41.667 --> 01:44:43.048]  Just like your daddy needs to, see?
[01:44:43.368 --> 01:44:44.709]  Yeah, I'm still learning.
[01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:45.650]  Hey, I'm teasing.
[01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:47.551]  You're doing a great job.
[01:44:48.032 --> 01:44:49.113]  We need to set a camera over here.
[01:44:49.173 --> 01:44:50.494]  People always look at me when they're in the guest seat.
[01:44:50.514 --> 01:44:51.274]  We can put one over here.
[01:44:51.695 --> 01:44:52.795]  That way it gets straight on.
[01:44:53.856 --> 01:44:55.017]  Well, brother, amazing.
[01:44:55.057 --> 01:44:56.078]  TexasGunRights.org.
[01:44:56.098 --> 01:45:00.061]  Everybody should get your book at writtenhousebook.com or they can find it everywhere else.
[01:45:00.121 --> 01:45:00.822]  Just amazing.
[01:45:01.442 --> 01:45:03.303]  Let's pray for President Obama.
[01:45:03.323 --> 01:45:03.904]  You ever pray on air?
[01:45:05.272 --> 01:45:07.816]  I have not prayed on air, but I'd love to pray with you on air if you want to.
[01:45:08.056 --> 01:45:10.299]  Would you lead us in a short prayer for President Trump and America?
[01:45:10.499 --> 01:45:11.040]  Absolutely.
[01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:25.266]  Father God, I just ask that you watch over President Trump and keep him safe and protected and that you expose the lies of the Democrats and you hold the people that need to be held accountable accountable, Father God.
[01:45:25.306 --> 01:45:33.789]  And I just ask that you keep President Trump safe and you give him the words of wisdom that he needs to deliver and you continue to watch over him.
[01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:34.550]  In your name we pray.
[01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:34.850]  Amen.
[01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:36.152]  Amen.
[01:45:36.552 --> 01:45:41.178]  God, please protect Trump and please give discernment to the people and have an awakening and have us turn back to this evil.
[01:45:41.778 --> 01:45:43.861]  Strengthen our hand against the enemy and confuse the enemy.
[01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:46.104]  And please help us to defend the children.
[01:45:46.144 --> 01:45:46.905]  We seek your face.
[01:45:46.945 --> 01:45:47.485]  We repent.
[01:45:47.926 --> 01:45:50.609]  We ask you to heal our land in the name of your son that you sent to save us.
[01:45:50.649 --> 01:45:51.390]  Jesus Christ, amen.
[01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:51.530]  Amen.
[01:45:53.012 --> 01:45:53.573]  All right, brother.
[01:45:54.594 --> 01:45:55.054]  Amazing.
[01:45:55.134 --> 01:45:56.756]  And yes, sir, are you living in Texas now?
[01:45:57.056 --> 01:45:57.877]  Yes, sir, full time.
[01:45:57.897 --> 01:45:58.658]  Where are you living?
[01:45:59.118 --> 01:46:00.820]  I live down in the DFW Metroplex.
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:01.080]  Great.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.742]  I'm not going to expose exactly where I live.
[01:46:02.782 --> 01:46:03.582]  No, no, we don't want to do that.
[01:46:03.602 --> 01:46:04.984]  Well, don't worry, you're not a soft target.
[01:46:05.024 --> 01:46:08.187]  But yeah, I would love to get you on remote anytime you got something you're doing.
[01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:11.210]  And I heard you're doing some great skeet shoots and other stuff.
[01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:12.251]  Absolutely.
[01:46:12.451 --> 01:46:16.974]  We just had a great successful event at work for our first annual clay shoot.
[01:46:17.294 --> 01:46:19.056]  We had a bunch of great people come out.
[01:46:19.276 --> 01:46:21.337]  Yeah, when I was up in Dallas at Glenn Beck's place, they had some folks that were there.
[01:46:21.357 --> 01:46:21.858]  They said it was great.
[01:46:21.938 --> 01:46:22.999]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:23.019 --> 01:46:24.220]  Maybe you can come out next year.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.440]  Anytime you want, brother.
[01:46:25.621 --> 01:46:26.001]  Absolutely.
[01:46:26.021 --> 01:46:27.222]  What's your favorite rifle right now?
[01:46:28.263 --> 01:46:30.845]  Right now I have an Arrow Precision as my truck gun.
[01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:32.726]  And what's the caliber?
[01:46:33.067 --> 01:46:33.247]  It's 5.56.
[01:46:33.547 --> 01:46:35.729]  I like .300 Win Mag.
[01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:37.071]  .300 Win Mag's a good gun.
[01:46:37.091 --> 01:46:38.532]  I guess that's more for long-range deer.
[01:46:38.552 --> 01:46:41.015]  Yeah, mine's just a little truck gun, 5.56.
[01:46:41.075 --> 01:46:43.197]  Well, you definitely know what you're doing with 5.56.
[01:46:43.237 --> 01:46:43.357]  Oh, boy.
[01:46:46.479 --> 01:46:47.660]  No, I mean, you did a good shot.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:48.980]  Yeah, I'm still being sued.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:49.880]  I gotta watch what I say.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.821]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:46:50.841 --> 01:46:52.261]  I didn't mean about those guys.
[01:46:52.281 --> 01:46:54.202]  Well, you definitely are a firearms aficionado, though.
[01:46:54.342 --> 01:46:56.323]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thank you for having me on.
[01:46:56.923 --> 01:46:57.963]  All right, Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:46:58.103 --> 01:46:58.584]  Amazing.
[01:46:58.744 --> 01:47:00.484]  Get the book, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:00.564 --> 01:47:00.944]  Acquitted.
[01:47:01.825 --> 01:47:03.245]  Find out more as well.
[01:47:04.386 --> 01:47:05.106]  What's your ex-account?
[01:47:06.315 --> 01:47:10.679]  Uh, this is Kyle R. This is Kyle R. All right, brother, where are you going off to next?
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:17.325]  I'm gonna go grab some lunch, and that's where I'm headed, and then headed back home, and gonna relax for a little bit, work tomorrow morning.
[01:47:17.345 --> 01:47:18.766]  All right, brother, God bless you.
[01:47:18.786 --> 01:47:20.528]  Kyle Rittenhouse in studio.
[01:47:21.008 --> 01:47:22.389]  I think that was a great interview.
[01:47:22.429 --> 01:47:24.211]  We got another special guest we'll talk about when she gets here.
[01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:27.173]  In studio, straight ahead, the third hour.
[01:47:27.233 --> 01:47:28.374]  Remember, you're the Paul Reveres.
[01:47:28.734 --> 01:47:30.055]  You're unstoppable when you get excited.
[01:47:30.075 --> 01:47:30.696]  Share the links.
[01:47:30.756 --> 01:47:31.837]  Reload, show them to the live feed.
[01:47:32.117 --> 01:47:33.298]  InfoWars.com, where's the live show?
[01:47:33.838 --> 01:47:35.620]  And support us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:36.641]  We need the funding.
[01:47:36.681 --> 01:47:37.441]  We got great products.
[01:47:37.581 --> 01:47:39.483]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:39.523 --> 01:47:40.484]  Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:47:41.164 --> 01:47:45.747]  The United States is like one of the top or most sick countries in the world.
[01:47:45.787 --> 01:47:48.909]  We spend more than anybody else per capita on medicine.
[01:47:48.949 --> 01:47:58.596]  This looks like it's going to get to a very bad place because, like I said earlier, all I see is the people that own the medical system, you know, the banks, the insurance companies, big pharma doubling down.
[01:47:58.956 --> 01:48:04.160]  All I have discovered that I can do is try to get things into the hands of patients as much as possible.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.423]  That includes medication, that includes information, that includes awareness.
[01:48:09.123 --> 01:48:12.487]  And we have to help people navigate the system.
[01:48:12.547 --> 01:48:19.054]  I, unfortunately, Alex, I think where it's going to go is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[01:48:19.515 --> 01:48:21.777]  Explain what the wellness company does.
[01:48:22.518 --> 01:48:25.441]  And again, it's a lot bigger than just COVID or monkeypox.
[01:48:25.802 --> 01:48:27.504]  I mean, you're talking about a, you know,
[01:48:28.064 --> 01:48:32.308]  People I think are fearful of getting healthcare because it's going to be terribly expensive.
[01:48:52.845 --> 01:48:59.468]  The reality is you can deliver health care for the vast majority of your needs extremely effectively.
[01:48:59.808 --> 01:49:00.648]  We can do it.
[01:49:00.748 --> 01:49:02.489]  We can get cost-effective.
[01:49:02.509 --> 01:49:03.889]  We can get medication in your hands.
[01:49:04.209 --> 01:49:10.272]  What you guys are doing is getting people directly in touch with doctors, nurses, practitioners, and others and everything that they need.
[01:49:10.592 --> 01:49:14.193]  That's why I'm so excited about the wellness company and onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:49:14.373 --> 01:49:17.675]  Everybody needs to mark that down and get ahead of this in these uncertain times.
[01:49:17.915 --> 01:49:18.515]  If you don't
[01:49:18.735 --> 01:49:19.236]  All right.
[01:49:39.994 --> 01:49:42.095]  Fiat authority over duly elected officials.
[01:49:42.115 --> 01:49:45.877]  That, to me, is the scariest, most evil idea I've ever heard.
[01:49:46.317 --> 01:49:53.241]  Your most effective unit is right back to you, your family, and somebody whom you contact to use their judgment to help you.
[01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:55.502]  Link to use is onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:49:55.582 --> 01:49:57.563]  One word, onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:49:57.583 --> 01:49:58.264]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:49:58.284 --> 01:49:59.324]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[01:49:59.384 --> 01:49:59.825]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:00.125 --> 01:50:01.285]  Well, that was a great interview.
[01:50:01.986 --> 01:50:05.488]  And again, he's one of the most prominent doctors in the world.
[01:50:06.408 --> 01:50:12.609]  And you could say, you know, kind of more mainline or whatever, but even he has come a long way, and he's been standing up for free speech.
[01:50:13.029 --> 01:50:14.690]  And so the Wellness Company are awesome folks.
[01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:15.590]  They're a huge sponsor.
[01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:22.971]  These folks are the one-stop shop, and they've also got their spike protein detox on the site as well.
[01:50:23.131 --> 01:50:27.672]  So be sure and visit right now onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:50:27.872 --> 01:50:29.513]  Onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:50:29.533 --> 01:50:31.633]  Again, I want to thank Dr. Drew for coming on.
[01:50:49.821 --> 01:50:53.742]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is hands down the most badass truck in the world.
[01:50:54.983 --> 01:50:58.484]  A 2024 AEB Dodge Prospector.
[01:50:58.764 --> 01:51:01.885]  This is my dream truck, but this truck won't belong to me.
[01:51:02.225 --> 01:51:03.405]  It's going to belong to you.
[01:51:03.646 --> 01:51:11.048]  The folks that visit thealexjonestore.com and enter to win for free by entering your email or when you buy products they put you in five
[01:51:11.608 --> 01:51:14.009]  10 times in the raffle for this bad boy.
[01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:20.170]  I'm going to walk you through this, but this is hands down, look it up yourself, the most badass truck in the world.
[01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:23.810]  Folks, I've had a lot of big trucks, but I'm telling you, they don't even compare to this.
[01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:28.891]  This sucker is a dream to drive, so smooth in the city and off-road, it's insane.
[01:51:29.311 --> 01:51:33.252]  And when you enter to win this, you fund the Info War and take it to the globalists.
[01:51:33.472 --> 01:51:35.373]  Now, let's talk about this badass truck.
[01:51:35.393 --> 01:51:36.653]  This is a freaking monster!
[01:51:37.702 --> 01:51:39.664]  Now, you're getting the colors I like the best.
[01:51:39.704 --> 01:51:42.466]  This dark green, this black, the red pinstripe.
[01:51:42.486 --> 01:51:45.969]  But what really matters is the shocks, the giant tires, the engine.
[01:51:46.209 --> 01:51:50.613]  Now, because one of you lucky people out there is going to own this truck, I'm not going to take it off-road.
[01:51:50.833 --> 01:51:52.395]  But we've taken other ones off-road.
[01:51:52.695 --> 01:51:54.997]  And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing like it.
[01:51:55.317 --> 01:51:58.140]  Look at this sexy monster, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:51:59.020]  Woo!
[01:52:01.124 --> 01:52:08.554]  And when you enter to win this baby, you're supporting the Infowar and you're spreading the word at the critical time going into this election in the year 2024.
[01:52:08.774 --> 01:52:15.363]  This truck symbolizes everything that Al Gore and Kamala Harris and the rest of these rats aren't.
[01:52:15.563 --> 01:52:18.047]  This symbolizes Americana, strength, power.
[01:52:18.707 --> 01:52:19.768]  And the American dream.
[01:52:20.008 --> 01:52:20.928]  I love Dodge.
[01:52:21.088 --> 01:52:22.069]  I love this truck.
[01:52:22.289 --> 01:52:23.270]  It is so incredible.
[01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:28.172]  I forgot to mention this truck is a 2024 $138,000 and when you win you get $10,000 cash on top of it.
[01:52:28.192 --> 01:52:29.953]  Enter to win right now at thealexjonestore.com
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.141]  Hello, Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[01:52:43.161 --> 01:52:45.043]  If I were the devil.
[01:52:46.003 --> 01:52:49.626]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[01:52:50.166 --> 01:52:56.751]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[01:52:56.771 --> 01:52:58.152]  Thee.
[01:52:59.677 --> 01:53:02.699]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[01:53:02.859 --> 01:53:06.321]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:07.982]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[01:53:08.062 --> 01:53:09.763]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[01:53:10.203 --> 01:53:13.625]  With the wisdom of the serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[01:53:13.865 --> 01:53:14.585]  Do as you please.
[01:53:15.046 --> 01:53:17.147]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[01:53:17.587 --> 01:53:21.089]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[01:53:21.489 --> 01:53:25.111]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[01:53:25.551 --> 01:53:27.753]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[01:53:28.693 --> 01:53:31.014]  Our father, witch art in Washington.
[01:53:31.895 --> 01:53:33.055]  And then I'd get organized.
[01:53:33.135 --> 01:53:39.118]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[01:53:39.178 --> 01:53:42.319]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.300]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:47.362]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[01:53:47.662 --> 01:53:49.523]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[01:53:51.163 --> 01:54:01.667]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[01:54:01.687 --> 01:54:07.029]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[01:54:07.489 --> 01:54:10.710]  The President of the United States is racist.
[01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:15.152]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the discipline of
[01:54:15.852 --> 01:54:17.293]  Just let those run wild.
[01:54:17.373 --> 01:54:20.074]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[01:54:20.334 --> 01:54:22.295]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[01:54:22.415 --> 01:54:26.337]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[01:54:26.477 --> 01:54:30.538]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[01:54:33.551 --> 01:54:38.373]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[01:54:38.813 --> 01:54:46.196]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[01:54:47.837 --> 01:54:49.577]  I would caution against extremes.
[01:54:49.657 --> 01:54:50.618]  I'm here to warn people!
[01:54:50.638 --> 01:54:51.918]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[01:54:52.198 --> 01:54:53.099]  This isn't a game!
[01:54:53.299 --> 01:54:56.620]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct.
[01:54:57.330 --> 01:55:04.135]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[01:55:04.856 --> 01:55:13.262]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[01:55:13.322 --> 01:55:16.464]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[01:55:34.475 --> 01:55:36.198]  Leonardo Joni coming up straight ahead.
[01:55:36.218 --> 01:55:39.362]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[01:55:39.682 --> 01:55:41.184]  Leonardo Joni is our guest.
[01:55:41.284 --> 01:55:43.087]  Very popular comedian.
[01:55:43.107 --> 01:55:45.710]  I've been on stage with her before with the great Kill Tony events.
[01:55:46.872 --> 01:55:50.274]  And she's here to talk about all the different things happening in the world.
[01:55:50.314 --> 01:55:55.556]  I was trying to get her on a couple weeks ago, and then I had to change the date because I had an emergency come up.
[01:55:56.317 --> 01:55:59.578]  And boy, are her topics she sent then even more important now.
[01:55:59.618 --> 01:56:13.725]  She sent some other topics too, but the WF calling for censorship of persons on X for speaking out against mass migration, European countries, anti-white propaganda advanced and allowed on all platforms, her censorship, the undermining of what Musk is trying to do by
[01:56:14.145 --> 01:56:19.128]  Operatives are still inside X. So much stuff that is going on.
[01:56:19.148 --> 01:56:24.792]  And all of this on the heels of Hillary Clinton yesterday on Mr. Moudow's program.
[01:56:25.112 --> 01:56:34.097]  Hillary Clinton wants to jail MAGA supporters, calls Trump threat to America one day after man tries to kill the 45th president again.
[01:56:34.117 --> 01:56:36.118]  This is just wild.
[01:56:36.158 --> 01:56:40.561]  And all these new videos of Democrats saying we need to eliminate Trump, put a bullet in him.
[01:56:41.342 --> 01:56:43.003]  And then they say Trump's putting out the violent.
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:44.260]  Rhetoric.
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.682]  So, Leonardo, thank you so much for coming in here today.
[01:56:46.922 --> 01:56:47.983]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:56:48.003 --> 01:56:48.983]  I'm really happy to be here.
[01:56:49.624 --> 01:56:49.964]  Wow.
[01:56:50.304 --> 01:56:51.465]  Where do you want to start here?
[01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:53.006]  We've got the EU, as you mentioned.
[01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:54.787]  Yeah, the WEF.
[01:56:55.047 --> 01:56:58.509]  And now G20 ministers meet in Brazil to discuss disinformation censorship agenda.
[01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:01.131]  That's the new headquarters there in Brazil.
[01:57:01.151 --> 01:57:04.533]  They admit the State Department's been quarterbacking, helping the communists rule that.
[01:57:04.553 --> 01:57:05.354]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:57:05.888 --> 01:57:08.510]  So Alex, free speech is being attacked everywhere.
[01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:19.756]  And the one place we actually had for free speech was X, Elon Musk's X. And we all know that Elon Musk is totally supportive of free speech, but he can only do so much.
[01:57:19.816 --> 01:57:31.383]  So he's got people inside of his office who are doing things like mass reporting people who are voicing things they don't like, especially against the mass migrations that are happening in Europe and America.
[01:57:31.403 --> 01:57:31.724]  Explain that.
[01:57:31.744 --> 01:57:33.645]  They're manipulating their internal algorithm.
[01:57:34.225 --> 01:57:35.946]  They are manipulating the internal algorithm.
[01:57:35.986 --> 01:57:43.788]  So what they do is they have a group chat with thousands of people and they also create bots and they say, hey, this is the account we want to target.
[01:57:44.208 --> 01:57:52.490]  Mass report them because what it does is it triggers the algorithm to automatically suspend someone regardless of whether they actually broke any X rules or not.
[01:57:53.746 --> 01:58:02.470]  And I've been told by ex-users about this when he first took over a year ago, and I've talked to Musk on air, and he's like, hey, we're trying to iron this out right now, but there's some moles, and that's what they're mainly doing.
[01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:08.953]  And I've been told behind the scenes they've had to just basically remove that function from my account, Alex Jones, or it would be shut down.
[01:58:09.213 --> 01:58:09.693]  Correct.
[01:58:09.733 --> 01:58:11.694]  But they're able to target others that haven't been, you know.
[01:58:11.954 --> 01:58:12.174]  Right.
[01:58:12.394 --> 01:58:13.775]  My count was at 105,000.
[01:58:13.995 --> 01:58:20.497]  I started actually reporting about one of these groups that was mass targeting people.
[01:58:20.837 --> 01:58:24.398]  And then the minute they caught that, they said, hey, we're going to mass target her.
[01:58:24.758 --> 01:58:29.220]  She's racist because she doesn't want people to be mass targeted that we disagree with.
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:32.362]  And I didn't stop because I really do believe in the truth getting out.
[01:58:32.502 --> 01:58:34.024]  I knew that they were going to mass report me.
[01:58:34.364 --> 01:58:35.625]  I knew they were going to be successful.
[01:58:35.765 --> 01:58:42.831]  I don't know if I'll be able to get my account back, but they succeeded in doing what they wanted to do, which was to censor a voice that was speaking out against them.
[01:58:43.971 --> 01:58:45.132]  And what you're saying is dead on.
[01:58:45.212 --> 01:58:56.845]  I mean, this is important because X is the only supermassive outlet other than Telegram, and that guy's been arrested now in the world, but dominant in the West is X, now becoming the number one platform because of free speech coming back to it.
[01:58:56.865 --> 01:59:04.032]  I mean, this is a, we got Rumble, we've got, you know, a lot of their subgroups like InfoWars, Man Up Video, but really, you know, the most important battleground is X.
[01:59:05.014 --> 01:59:07.375]  Well, they're going to take them down one at a time, right?
[01:59:07.535 --> 01:59:14.597]  And X is the big one because everybody is now giving voice to things that we have felt for years but weren't allowed to talk about.
[01:59:14.937 --> 01:59:16.518]  I mean, I've been a victim of censorship.
[01:59:16.538 --> 01:59:20.619]  I'm probably the most banned and censored female comedian for sure online.
[01:59:21.019 --> 01:59:27.041]  I lost an account because I made fun of people transitioning their toddlers, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous.
[01:59:27.381 --> 01:59:30.382]  And I did it at the time that they were telling people not to talk about this.
[01:59:30.902 --> 01:59:37.228]  The big thing we need to understand is they censor us from speaking out about issues at the time that they matter.
[01:59:37.888 --> 01:59:46.676]  So we're allowed to talk about them after, after the heat has passed, after your children have already been transitioned, but we need to be able to speak out about these things when it matters.
[01:59:47.625 --> 01:59:50.987]  That's right, and again, it's not just crazy, it's sick.
[01:59:51.708 --> 01:59:56.190]  As a baby, a toddler, you can say you're Superman, you can jump off a cliff, the kid will listen to you and do it.
[01:59:56.771 --> 02:00:04.996]  That's why you can't buy alcohol until you're 18 or join the military, or get alcohol until you're 21, because of the age of consent.
[02:00:05.016 --> 02:00:13.381]  So they're directly brainwashing children, and the schools are doing it when parents don't know, and fast-tracking them secretly to transition, literally putting them into a brainwashing cult.
[02:00:13.601 --> 02:00:22.689]  Yeah, and they like to create this illusion that everybody believes this so that you feel alone, so you feel like you're the only person who thinks it's crazy.
[02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:29.214]  And what X has done is had broken down that illusion because we see how many people are against these things.
[02:00:29.534 --> 02:00:32.236]  How many people think it's crazy to transition your children?
[02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:36.720]  How many people think it's crazy to be giving sex education in third grade?
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.125]  How many people are against the mass migrations and the complete turning over of your cultural fabric?
[02:00:42.725 --> 02:00:56.338]  And so this is why they're really targeting, and this is a really dangerous thing, because all you have to do is have a certain group say, hey, we don't like that, so we're going to mass report you into oblivion, and then those voices are completely gone from the platform.
[02:00:58.968 --> 02:01:04.750]  It's wildly unpopular to have borders and human trafficking and Kamala over 325,000 missing children.
[02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:11.473]  It's wildly unpopular to target three-year-olds to brainwash them to be another sex when they're not or to think they're a dolphin or a penguin.
[02:01:12.133 --> 02:01:14.894]  They can only do it if they put us in an echo chamber and make us feel alone.
[02:01:15.174 --> 02:01:15.594]  That's right.
[02:01:15.694 --> 02:01:16.915]  And that's their whole mission.
[02:01:16.995 --> 02:01:21.598]  And the other thing, too, is people are really losing sight of what free speech covers.
[02:01:21.939 --> 02:01:24.620]  People are saying things like, oh, I'm all for free speech.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.261]  I'm all for offensive comedy.
[02:01:26.642 --> 02:01:29.484]  But we need to draw the line at racism.
[02:01:29.544 --> 02:01:31.745]  We need to draw the line at things that are offensive.
[02:01:32.085 --> 02:01:36.688]  Now, you've got to understand, you might not like some of those ideas, but they're fully covered in free speech.
[02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:44.674]  And the terms like racism and offensive keep changing to modify and include things that the global elite do not want you talking about.
[02:01:47.259 --> 02:01:49.004]  So, let's talk about Musk.
[02:01:50.285 --> 02:01:52.446]  People can say, oh, he's a billionaire, he's not perfect.
[02:01:52.486 --> 02:01:54.027]  He's really taken on the system.
[02:01:54.047 --> 02:01:57.228]  They're really trying to criminally charge him in the EU, in Australia, in Brazil.
[02:01:57.268 --> 02:01:58.609]  They're really seizing his assets.
[02:01:59.409 --> 02:02:00.850]  They've sent the ADL after him.
[02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:08.973]  For anybody that is just sitting back and saying, oh, I don't trust him, well, I trust but verify, and Christ said, judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:02:09.553 --> 02:02:16.156]  Elon Musk is the global ambassador of free speech right now, and he is devastating the globalists, reaching hundreds of millions a day himself.
[02:02:16.677 --> 02:02:16.857]  I mean,
[02:02:17.637 --> 02:02:20.058]  I know because I've seen it in this last month.
[02:02:20.859 --> 02:02:24.901]  There was obviously internal stuff suppressing InfoWars account and real Alex Jones.
[02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:25.501]  It is down.
[02:02:25.521 --> 02:02:27.843]  Of course, our enemies already know this.
[02:02:27.863 --> 02:02:29.604]  They're already targeting us.
[02:02:29.624 --> 02:02:34.026]  40 million viewers Friday, 20 million over the weekend, 12 million or so yesterday.
[02:02:34.086 --> 02:02:34.727]  It'll be 15 million.
[02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:37.368]  I mean, that's just on X. I mean, wow.
[02:02:37.528 --> 02:02:42.271]  I mean, that's like I was swimming a race and I had bowling balls tied to my legs and must just cut them off.
[02:02:42.864 --> 02:02:45.465]  Yeah, I mean, I fully support Elon Musk.
[02:02:45.566 --> 02:02:46.646]  I stand behind him.
[02:02:46.806 --> 02:02:51.829]  I want him to know that he's got an army of people who support him and believe in what he's doing.
[02:02:52.489 --> 02:02:57.792]  And that's also why I'm fighting for this, because it is undermining what he's trying to do.
[02:02:57.852 --> 02:03:00.714]  And it's doing it in a very, very sneaky way.
[02:03:01.094 --> 02:03:03.015]  And I really don't think he knows about this.
[02:03:03.055 --> 02:03:11.820]  So what I would like is to bring this to his attention so that he can do something to stop the mass reporting from triggering an automatic suspension.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:13.101]  Well, he has to do what he did for himself.
[02:03:13.121 --> 02:03:16.563]  It came out when he first bought it two years ago that they were flagging him.
[02:03:16.623 --> 02:03:18.765]  So they must have made a different rule for himself.
[02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.906]  Well, he made it where it's just default.
[02:03:20.966 --> 02:03:22.627]  It actually, you know, is open and free.
[02:03:23.068 --> 02:03:27.951]  And then a little birds told me that they that that's basically, I mean, I can tell you what happened.
[02:03:27.971 --> 02:03:28.592]  I've seen it.
[02:03:28.652 --> 02:03:32.074]  Plus, I was told it's not just me.
[02:03:32.114 --> 02:03:34.596]  It's must took the gloves off about three weeks ago.
[02:03:35.156 --> 02:03:37.137]  And so we're seeing all the accounts, not just ours.
[02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:40.710]  Yeah, yeah, well that's what was starting happening with mine.
[02:03:40.751 --> 02:03:42.651]  I mean, I've had things go totally viral.
[02:03:42.691 --> 02:03:53.913]  I had a joke that I tweeted that got 35 million views, and then the trolls came out, this is offensive, this is racist, and it really wasn't.
[02:03:53.933 --> 02:03:55.434]  It was a very light-hearted joke.
[02:03:55.734 --> 02:04:01.475]  And this is my point, you know, they're going to keep changing the definition of what's offensive and what they're covering.
[02:04:01.495 --> 02:04:04.556]  But the Democrats can't go on TV and say whites are inherently evil.
[02:04:05.416 --> 02:04:09.078]  And whether you're for Israel or not, blow up Israel, kill them all, that's okay for the left to say.
[02:04:09.098 --> 02:04:18.662]  And all this stuff, and then the ADL is doing all this, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and then comedians put out mild jokes about political correctness and you get banned.
[02:04:18.962 --> 02:04:20.662]  They're the ones creating the racial division.
[02:04:20.702 --> 02:04:21.663]  They're the ones doing this.
[02:04:22.023 --> 02:04:28.187]  Right, I wasn't even racially conscious until the last five years and it's because they keep driving over and over again.
[02:04:28.607 --> 02:04:34.991]  You're white, you're evil, your ancestors committed all kinds of oppression and this is total BS.
[02:04:35.011 --> 02:04:37.492]  There's so much diversity within white ethnic groups that...
[02:04:38.473 --> 02:04:39.114]  We're good to go.
[02:04:59.071 --> 02:05:01.373]  They've made a lady that's not white snow white.
[02:05:01.653 --> 02:05:04.255]  Well, Alex, they want to erase us completely from the culture.
[02:05:04.355 --> 02:05:07.817]  You know that these people like to rewrite history and they like to rewrite culture.
[02:05:07.877 --> 02:05:17.724]  And I think their plan is to completely decimate the white population from their own countries and then be able to create a false history of what was always the case.
[02:05:18.005 --> 02:05:21.147]  They'll say things like, oh, this is always what it's been.
[02:05:21.207 --> 02:05:25.570]  America's always been a multi-racial, multi-ethnic country.
[02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:26.691]  We know that's not true.
[02:05:28.322 --> 02:05:42.128]  But you can't, again, openly say white people are inherently evil, the universities, the media, because the majority's not white, 98% worldwide, and then have whites hate themselves and then tell all the other groups to go out and kill you and have 21 black against white crime.
[02:05:42.148 --> 02:05:47.870]  And I don't blame all black folks, even the majority, no, but there is a highly motivated minority of black males that are targeting white people.
[02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:49.711]  It's a fact, and the media tries to cover it up.
[02:05:50.071 --> 02:05:52.432]  Well, what happens when you demonize a group, right, Alex?
[02:05:52.472 --> 02:05:53.973]  Then people feel justified.
[02:05:54.233 --> 02:05:56.774]  People have fallen under this brainwashing.
[02:05:57.034 --> 02:06:00.175]  The ADL is doing to Christian white people what Hitler did to Jews.
[02:06:00.255 --> 02:06:00.855]  That's correct.
[02:06:01.015 --> 02:06:08.859]  I fully agree with that because they're completely putting us as if we're the enemies of all of humanity and we're these evil people.
[02:06:09.039 --> 02:06:12.560]  Also, they tell you that it's white supremacy and white oppression that's running the countries.
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:17.302]  If that were true, why can you freely criticize white people with absolutely no repercussions?
[02:06:18.424 --> 02:06:24.368]  Remember two years ago, the FBI came out in a report and said the number one terror threat is conservative Catholics?
[02:06:25.349 --> 02:06:26.990]  I mean, I'm not Catholic, but I look at the numbers.
[02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:30.993]  I mean, conservative Catholics are probably the most law-abiding group there is.
[02:06:31.193 --> 02:06:33.454]  Yeah, that's correct, that's correct.
[02:06:33.474 --> 02:06:34.495]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:06:34.635 --> 02:06:37.097]  But you've got to ask yourself, Alex, who are they a threat to?
[02:06:37.137 --> 02:06:38.598]  Because they're correct, they are a threat.
[02:06:38.918 --> 02:06:39.839]  Who are they a threat to?
[02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.307]  And it's the global agenda.
[02:06:42.327 --> 02:06:44.108]  Can you imagine being the FBI, the Justice Department?
[02:06:44.128 --> 02:06:46.209]  Let's put out a report to the FBI agents.
[02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:47.709]  The number one threat is conservative Catholics.
[02:06:48.010 --> 02:06:48.230]  What?
[02:06:48.250 --> 02:06:51.491]  I mean, it's just like, it's like saying, little old ladies are going to be robbing banks.
[02:06:51.511 --> 02:06:52.172]  We'll look for them.
[02:06:52.212 --> 02:06:52.792]  I mean, you know.
[02:06:52.952 --> 02:06:53.112]  Yep.
[02:06:53.813 --> 02:06:54.393]  It's insane.
[02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.674]  It's a demonizing of the people.
[02:06:55.694 --> 02:06:58.135]  But also you have to realize the people are demoralized now.
[02:06:58.175 --> 02:07:00.256]  They can't even see what's true anymore.
[02:07:00.936 --> 02:07:04.698]  So all you have to do is pump this propaganda into their brains over and over again.
[02:07:04.738 --> 02:07:06.059]  I ought to watch out for those Catholics.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:09.120]  The worst.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:12.021]  You know how many times I've been attacked by random Catholics on the street?
[02:07:13.002 --> 02:07:14.422]  Just throwing holy water at me.
[02:07:15.922 --> 02:07:17.143]  It's ridiculous!
[02:07:18.563 --> 02:07:20.264]  And remember, all the school boards are terrorists.
[02:07:20.284 --> 02:07:22.625]  Remember when they didn't want transgenderism or critical race theory?
[02:07:22.645 --> 02:07:23.245]  Right, right.
[02:07:23.285 --> 02:07:23.785]  That's what they do.
[02:07:23.825 --> 02:07:25.065]  They label you a terrorist.
[02:07:25.365 --> 02:07:27.066]  They label you a far-right extremist.
[02:07:27.346 --> 02:07:34.148]  The positions that today are labeled far-right extremists have been the dominant position in human history for literally thousands of years.
[02:07:34.588 --> 02:07:36.429]  But now they're far-right extremism.
[02:07:38.843 --> 02:07:40.086]  It's just totally insane.
[02:07:40.126 --> 02:07:43.294]  I mean, what did the, what did the Judge Department think would happen when that, when that came out?
[02:07:44.209 --> 02:07:45.409]  I mean, it's just like crazy.
[02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:45.990]  Right.
[02:07:46.190 --> 02:07:54.493]  And then they have things like people are now, they feel totally justified in attempting assassinations against our former president, and then they want to act like they don't know where this came from.
[02:07:54.833 --> 02:08:02.356]  It's the same exact agenda that is targeting white people, where white people are getting randomly attacked in random acts of violence on the street.
[02:08:02.776 --> 02:08:04.257]  And then the FBI suppresses the crime numbers.
[02:08:04.637 --> 02:08:05.317]  Of course they do.
[02:08:05.577 --> 02:08:10.699]  Or they will classify perpetrators as white who are clearly actually Hispanic or black.
[02:08:10.759 --> 02:08:12.220]  I've seen this multiple times.
[02:08:14.212 --> 02:08:15.533]  Yeah, England's the worst at that.
[02:08:16.354 --> 02:08:23.880]  Well, you saw what happened in England, right, when you had that Rwandan guy who was, he was first generation or second generation and they- Stabbed all those little girls?
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:26.622]  They stabbed all these, they were white children.
[02:08:26.882 --> 02:08:37.370]  He stabbed and killed multiple white children and anybody who said anything against it or pointed out that he was not a native Englishman- Because the headline was, Englishman kills three little girls and stabs ten others.
[02:08:37.410 --> 02:08:37.811]  Correct.
[02:08:38.051 --> 02:08:38.832]  And it really wasn't.
[02:08:38.892 --> 02:08:41.774]  It was a Rwandan child of immigrants.
[02:08:41.834 --> 02:08:43.315]  By the way, I've seen the unblurred footage.
[02:08:43.375 --> 02:08:52.159]  Little girls at a Taylor Swift dance lesson, literally with giant, giant... I mean, he just butchered them.
[02:08:53.119 --> 02:08:53.299]  Right.
[02:08:53.379 --> 02:08:57.361]  And so you have to ask yourself, where does a person like this get the idea to do something like this?
[02:08:57.661 --> 02:08:58.261]  Oh, jeez!
[02:08:59.302 --> 02:09:00.763]  There's a dance club of little girls.
[02:09:00.783 --> 02:09:01.483]  Let me go kill them.
[02:09:03.598 --> 02:09:18.783]  Yep, and when you've had it pumped into your head over and over again, that the people of this racial ethnic group are responsible for every hardship in your life, you feel fully justified for going after them, and going after them where it hurts, in the most vulnerable population that cannot defend themselves.
[02:09:18.843 --> 02:09:19.704]  I can't even cover it all.
[02:09:19.804 --> 02:09:26.146]  I see 20, 30 reports out of Sweden, Germany, France, Italy a day, where North African or Muslim men
[02:09:27.253 --> 02:09:33.758]  Walk up and stab a mother and then stab the baby, and it's like they just come like flies, you know what, to babies and women.
[02:09:34.078 --> 02:09:34.298]  Yeah.
[02:09:34.819 --> 02:09:37.280]  Oh, there's a woman with a baby!
[02:09:37.601 --> 02:09:41.604]  I mean, it's like... Because those are the future of those countries, right?
[02:09:41.664 --> 02:09:43.485]  The women are the ones who bear the children.
[02:09:43.505 --> 02:09:44.486]  The children are the future.
[02:09:44.506 --> 02:09:45.887]  They want to get rid of all of that.
[02:09:46.067 --> 02:09:48.549]  I remember the new Black Panther party had, uh, what's his name?
[02:09:48.569 --> 02:09:53.314]  Khalid Mohammed said, like, back in the 90s, he said, you kill the white women and you kill the white babies.
[02:09:53.354 --> 02:09:53.494]  Why?
[02:09:53.514 --> 02:09:55.876]  You kill the little, beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby?
[02:09:56.136 --> 02:09:58.338]  That's right, because that'll be the military of the future.
[02:09:58.538 --> 02:10:03.443]  And you kill the woman, because every nine months she lays down and military reinforcements roll out.
[02:10:03.663 --> 02:10:05.825]  So goddammit, you kill the white woman!
[02:10:06.726 --> 02:10:07.146]  There you go.
[02:10:08.188 --> 02:10:08.828]  You think I'm joking?
[02:10:08.848 --> 02:10:09.749]  Pull up Khalid Muhammad.
[02:10:09.849 --> 02:10:10.129]  No, I know.
[02:10:10.149 --> 02:10:11.309]  You're just very passionate.
[02:10:11.509 --> 02:10:13.490]  I mean, that's pretty much his voice.
[02:10:14.230 --> 02:10:16.031]  Pull up Khalid Muhammad says kill white women.
[02:10:16.051 --> 02:10:16.751]  You think I'm joking?
[02:10:17.051 --> 02:10:17.972]  I don't think you're joking.
[02:10:18.492 --> 02:10:23.534]  And then he would also say, don't be going into the black neighborhood and stabbing the black people.
[02:10:23.814 --> 02:10:24.874]  Those are the good people.
[02:10:25.134 --> 02:10:27.495]  Go kill the white people when you mug them.
[02:10:28.015 --> 02:10:28.996]  And I love black folks.
[02:10:29.056 --> 02:10:32.817]  Most black people abhorred this, but the media covers this up.
[02:10:35.069 --> 02:10:40.630]  Yeah, well, you know, when you keep telling people that these are the people that are evil, this is the nature of evil.
[02:10:40.930 --> 02:10:45.732]  They present themselves as the victim, and then that justifies whatever evil actions they want to take.
[02:10:45.972 --> 02:10:47.692]  And we're not allowed to speak out about it.
[02:10:47.792 --> 02:10:50.273]  And this is why X is such a crucial platform.
[02:10:50.673 --> 02:10:55.494]  It's crucial for people to be able to voice, hey, we don't agree with this, and we're going to fight back.
[02:10:56.766 --> 02:10:58.808]  Your website's leonardisfunny.com?
[02:10:58.989 --> 02:11:01.251]  Yeah, that's pretty much the only place you can find me right now.
[02:11:01.411 --> 02:11:05.176]  There, Instagram and YouTube, because I've been censored on multiple platforms.
[02:11:05.556 --> 02:11:07.218]  I'm trying to get my ex-account back.
[02:11:07.238 --> 02:11:15.488]  This is an appeal to Elon Musk to go ahead and stop the mass reporting and bring back accounts like mine and several others that were the targets of this mass reporting.
[02:11:15.909 --> 02:11:16.469]  Absolutely.
[02:11:18.718 --> 02:11:22.060]  I've seen some of your great comedy, and I've been on the stage with you before as well.
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:23.201]  I'm glad we finally got you here.
[02:11:23.221 --> 02:11:24.001]  You're almost always out of town.
[02:11:24.021 --> 02:11:24.642]  We try to get you on.
[02:11:24.662 --> 02:11:25.962]  I guess you're fellow Austinite here.
[02:11:27.383 --> 02:11:31.146]  Give us a little, and we're on hundreds of radio stations, so we don't have to bleep any cussing, or they'll get fined.
[02:11:31.206 --> 02:11:32.266]  Democrats can cuss on radio.
[02:11:32.286 --> 02:11:36.889]  They don't ever get fined, but Democrats report us whenever it happens, and they mess with our stations, so we have to always delay it out.
[02:11:36.909 --> 02:11:38.530]  But you want to give us a little bit of your comedy, or maybe we can go?
[02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.890]  Sure, yeah.
[02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:43.933]  I actually sent a link of one of my viral reels that I think your audience would really appreciate.
[02:11:44.053 --> 02:11:47.315]  Okay, so we'll get to that after the break, because I'm sure I was giving it, but I don't see it on my list.
[02:11:47.335 --> 02:11:48.236]  Do we have that clip ready, guys?
[02:11:52.785 --> 02:11:54.585]  Okay, they have it, but I want to build it up.
[02:11:54.605 --> 02:11:55.746]  We'll play it after the break coming up.
[02:11:55.766 --> 02:11:58.126]  You want to give us a little bit of your live stuff here?
[02:11:58.166 --> 02:11:59.047]  You want my live comedy?
[02:11:59.287 --> 02:12:00.587]  Here's what I'm going to say, Alex.
[02:12:01.207 --> 02:12:05.148]  They're going to keep redefining what's offensive, and then what are we going to not be able to say anymore?
[02:12:05.168 --> 02:12:06.968]  We're not going to be able to say Europeans are white.
[02:12:06.988 --> 02:12:09.829]  We're not going to be able to say Haitians are cats, are eating cats.
[02:12:09.849 --> 02:12:11.990]  We're not going to be able to say fat women are gross.
[02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.050]  I mean, what's next?
[02:12:14.209 --> 02:12:15.449]  By the way, I have the articles here.
[02:12:32.714 --> 02:12:35.157]  There's video of the cats being roasted on spits.
[02:12:35.857 --> 02:12:39.441]  The Haitians are putting out online cookbooks on how to properly prepare the cats.
[02:12:39.901 --> 02:12:41.683]  And then meanwhile they just say it's not true.
[02:12:41.723 --> 02:12:45.326]  And oh, someone has been death-threatening and bomb-threatening the schools.
[02:12:45.366 --> 02:12:47.789]  Even the governor admitted it's coming from outside the country.
[02:12:48.329 --> 02:12:51.052]  The left's using IP spoofs and doing it.
[02:12:51.152 --> 02:12:51.372]  Yeah.
[02:12:51.652 --> 02:12:54.773]  Well, the party's telling you not to believe your eyes, not to believe your ears.
[02:12:55.114 --> 02:12:56.294]  We'll tell you what's true.
[02:12:56.674 --> 02:13:02.757]  And so they're going to work to censor anybody who speaks out against it, anybody who actually says, no, this is what's true.
[02:13:03.637 --> 02:13:05.618]  Well, Hillary has openly said she wants to.
[02:13:06.038 --> 02:13:07.018]  Let's play the Hillary clip.
[02:13:07.038 --> 02:13:07.478]  Clip one.
[02:13:07.518 --> 02:13:08.319]  Go ahead and play that.
[02:13:08.359 --> 02:13:08.739]  Here it is.
[02:13:12.318 --> 02:13:13.098]  So what do you make of that, Leonora?
[02:13:34.215 --> 02:13:35.796]  Well, I think Hillary Clinton's a demon.
[02:13:35.856 --> 02:13:37.157]  That's my impression.
[02:13:37.197 --> 02:13:37.357]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:37.678 --> 02:13:38.858]  Yeah, I don't trust her.
[02:13:39.059 --> 02:13:44.422]  You know, she's got a body count that is higher than some of the OnlyFans girls.
[02:13:44.843 --> 02:13:48.105]  She's out here openly threatening people.
[02:13:49.406 --> 02:13:51.488]  To call for mass censorship?
[02:13:51.689 --> 02:13:52.530]  See, this is what they do.
[02:13:52.570 --> 02:13:54.752]  They label you as a dangerous extremist.
[02:13:54.772 --> 02:13:56.955]  They did the same thing with terrorism, right?
[02:13:57.295 --> 02:13:59.597]  These are terrorists, so they have no human rights.
[02:13:59.838 --> 02:14:01.700]  And we saw what happened in Guantanamo Bay.
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:07.086]  Now they set the precedent that we can treat anybody that we label as a terrorist inhumanely.
[02:14:07.346 --> 02:14:09.529]  And that's her whole mission, because she is not human.
[02:14:12.113 --> 02:14:15.896]  And then she's going to decide what disinformation is, when she's the biggest liar we've ever seen.
[02:14:16.036 --> 02:14:16.596]  That's correct.
[02:14:16.616 --> 02:14:23.742]  She's going to say things like, oh, if you criticize a mass migration policy, that means you're a racist.
[02:14:24.082 --> 02:14:29.046]  The reason you don't want a bunch of people eating your pets is because you don't respect cultural differences.
[02:14:29.346 --> 02:14:31.748]  Hey, so what if these cars are crashing into you?
[02:14:31.988 --> 02:14:33.549]  They're learning how to drive.
[02:14:33.689 --> 02:14:34.490]  Give them a minute.
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:35.680]  Wow.
[02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.983]  How long is this reel we're going to play when we come back?
[02:14:38.263 --> 02:14:39.184]  It's about 90 seconds.
[02:14:39.464 --> 02:14:39.764]  Perfect.
[02:14:40.145 --> 02:14:44.970]  We're not going to break for like three and a half minutes, but I want to come back, intro, play that, and then expand from there.
[02:14:45.691 --> 02:14:53.939]  Don't you, I don't think, I mean, I know, I've seen it, that the censorship pissed off the comedic community.
[02:14:54.884 --> 02:15:11.761]  Really bad the last few years and caused a major backlash because I know not just when I've gone to Joe Rogan's mothership or the Vulcan gas company with you and I at next door, but I've been gone to comedy clubs other parts of the country and it's all super politically incorrect and pretty much everywhere.
[02:15:11.781 --> 02:15:13.242]  That's what's packing stadiums.
[02:15:14.003 --> 02:15:16.586]  And so I think the backlash there has been bigger than anywhere.
[02:15:16.966 --> 02:15:24.649]  Yeah, well, they have attacked comedians because comedians are the court jesters, and the court jesters are the only ones who are allowed to speak the truth.
[02:15:25.009 --> 02:15:26.149]  They don't even want that.
[02:15:26.589 --> 02:15:30.851]  Comedy is a way to actually tell people the truth and make it funny.
[02:15:31.211 --> 02:15:36.453]  Humor gets past people's defenses and brainwashing, so that's their first target.
[02:15:36.753 --> 02:15:37.413]  Get rid of this.
[02:15:37.693 --> 02:15:40.274]  We can't even have the clowns telling the truth.
[02:15:40.794 --> 02:15:53.209]  And that's the reason I actually came to Austin because I did stand up in New York and I literally had people wanting to fight me because I was making jokes about how the trans agenda was basically anti-female and it was dismantling all of our rights.
[02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:55.111]  Wait a minute, hold on.
[02:15:55.151 --> 02:15:58.175]  It's not okay that almost every sport is dominated by biological males now?
[02:15:58.911 --> 02:16:00.612]  Yeah, I love that.
[02:16:00.692 --> 02:16:05.974]  I say this before, all these women are getting their faces bashed in by biological males.
[02:16:06.014 --> 02:16:10.496]  I'm like, hey, at least in the 80s, if a man wanted to beat you up, he had to marry you first.
[02:16:12.742 --> 02:16:18.864]  Well, yeah, and they have Gillette commercials and many others where the guy sees a good-looking girl, he wants to talk to her, and the guy stops him.
[02:16:18.884 --> 02:16:20.764]  Like, oh, don't even talk to a woman.
[02:16:20.824 --> 02:16:21.044]  Right.
[02:16:21.344 --> 02:16:26.046]  Oh, but if you're an Islamist gang-raping Laura Logan, it's okay.
[02:16:26.206 --> 02:16:26.986]  Totally okay.
[02:16:27.286 --> 02:16:28.626]  Yeah, that's insane to me.
[02:16:28.706 --> 02:16:32.588]  Also, that's because they're trying to make men afraid to be men.
[02:16:33.108 --> 02:16:41.090]  We have the Me Too movement, which completely traumatized men from even being able to talk to women, which means, how is our species supposed to get on?
[02:16:42.131 --> 02:16:44.216]  The whole reason we're here is because men pursue women.
[02:16:44.557 --> 02:16:45.920]  Women want to be pursued.
[02:16:46.441 --> 02:16:49.167]  I don't want to go after a man and be like, oh, will you like me?
[02:16:49.247 --> 02:16:49.548]  No!
[02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:51.792]  That's against the order of things.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:54.072]  In every species the male pursues.
[02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:56.033]  Yes, and that's how it works.
[02:16:56.133 --> 02:16:59.076]  Women don't want men, like we don't just see a man and want them.
[02:16:59.496 --> 02:17:00.597]  Usually you win us over.
[02:17:00.877 --> 02:17:03.119]  I've been won over by some bad characters.
[02:17:03.139 --> 02:17:04.040]  I gotta tell you that, Alex.
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:06.141]  So, you know, you gotta screen a little better, ladies.
[02:17:06.522 --> 02:17:10.485]  However, you have to allow men to be men so that women can be women.
[02:17:10.505 --> 02:17:12.787]  That's why we have this whole mixing up of gender roles.
[02:17:13.207 --> 02:17:15.409]  Everybody's confused and on antidepressants.
[02:17:15.609 --> 02:17:23.017]  Well, look, the Tabastock Institute in the CIA developed a plan in the 60s, I've been covering it for 30 years, it's for depopulation, it's to break down society.
[02:17:23.037 --> 02:17:24.339]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:17:24.399 --> 02:17:25.400]  I 100% believe that.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.204]  Because then, you know, people don't reproduce, and they don't keep society going.
[02:17:29.684 --> 02:17:32.027]  It's a total sabotage, and America's the model.
[02:17:32.047 --> 02:17:34.850]  That's why we're the sickest, the most unhealthy, or, you know, the most infertile.
[02:17:34.890 --> 02:17:35.591]  I mean, we're under attack.
[02:17:35.731 --> 02:17:38.652]  Yeah, well, as you know, we're under attack in our water supply.
[02:17:38.672 --> 02:17:43.413]  They're putting chemicals in to make people infertile, to drop men's testosterone levels.
[02:17:43.733 --> 02:17:50.755]  I mean, there's been studies where you boosted men's testosterone and suddenly they were going for the more feminine women, they were more outgoing, they were willing to fight.
[02:17:51.075 --> 02:17:53.075]  This is what we need to uphold a society.
[02:17:53.395 --> 02:17:58.256]  And women have been lied to by feminism that anytime there's a strong man, I got to attack him.
[02:17:58.516 --> 02:17:59.677]  He's there to defend you.
[02:17:59.697 --> 02:18:00.057]  That's right.
[02:18:00.077 --> 02:18:01.437]  Leonardo Johnny's our guest.
[02:18:01.517 --> 02:18:04.158]  And by the way, I've noticed that it's the awake
[02:18:04.958 --> 02:18:08.664]  Populist women, we call conservative, that are powerful and smart, like you.
[02:18:09.025 --> 02:18:09.806]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:09.846 --> 02:18:10.247]  Stay with us.
[02:18:10.287 --> 02:18:13.693]  Leftist women are these little unhappy rats, just like leftist men.
[02:18:13.713 --> 02:18:14.154]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:21.687 --> 02:18:27.749]  If you want your shot to own this piece of pure Americana, the most powerful, amazing truck in the world today, it's real simple.

[02:18:44.736 --> 02:18:52.800]  Now, you're getting the colors I like the best, this dark green, this black, the red pinstripe, but what really matters is the shocks, the giant tires, the engine.
[02:18:53.141 --> 02:18:56.442]  Folks, I've had a lot of big trucks, but I'm telling you, they don't even compare to this.
[02:18:56.843 --> 02:19:01.005]  Be part of this, be part of history, be part of saving the republic, and believe me, you want this truck.
[02:19:01.585 --> 02:19:03.506]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:19:03.746 --> 02:19:06.968]  I'll see you there, and I can't wait to find out who the lucky winner is going to be.
[02:19:09.109 --> 02:19:10.610]  I'm telling you, this is better than sex!
[02:19:14.568 --> 02:19:16.230]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:19:17.611 --> 02:19:19.673]  Anybody else in here like the truth?
[02:19:22.816 --> 02:19:24.158]  I don't trust the government for sh**.
[02:19:24.178 --> 02:19:25.199]  I don't care what they tell me.
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:28.723]  They're like, hey, you should drink eight glasses of water a day.
[02:19:29.023 --> 02:19:30.004]  I'm like, why?
[02:19:31.265 --> 02:19:32.246]  What's in the water?
[02:19:34.008 --> 02:19:35.189]  Is this why everybody's gay?
[02:19:35.209 --> 02:19:36.130]  Because I'm not having it.
[02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:36.751]  You understand?
[02:19:42.978 --> 02:19:44.679]  Some of you guys are like, but I'm gay.
[02:19:44.739 --> 02:19:45.879]  Stop drinking the tap water.
[02:19:45.899 --> 02:19:46.759]  What do you want me to tell you?
[02:19:52.661 --> 02:19:53.902]  I used to believe in UFOs.
[02:19:53.962 --> 02:19:55.082]  Anybody believe in UFOs?
[02:19:55.302 --> 02:19:55.582]  Aliens?
[02:19:55.862 --> 02:19:56.002]  Yeah.
[02:19:56.503 --> 02:19:57.523]  I was right there with you.
[02:19:58.203 --> 02:20:00.564]  And then Hillary Clinton said they're real.
[02:20:00.664 --> 02:20:02.665]  And I said, nope, they're demons.
[02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:09.387]  No wonder they're so into anal.
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.584]  You guys, uh, you guys upset that that vaccine's not working?
[02:20:27.853 --> 02:20:29.535]  I was, I was pretty disappointed.
[02:20:29.555 --> 02:20:30.656]  You know, I made a lot of plans.
[02:20:30.716 --> 02:20:33.679]  I signed my dad up for his fifth booster, but the fucker's still alive.
[02:20:35.991 --> 02:20:37.572]  I'm going to get out of here.
[02:20:37.592 --> 02:20:37.812]  I love it.
[02:20:37.832 --> 02:20:38.292]  Leonardo Joni.
[02:20:38.912 --> 02:20:39.713]  I love it.
[02:20:39.753 --> 02:20:40.853]  Leonardo Joni.
[02:20:40.953 --> 02:20:41.794]  That is great.
[02:20:42.274 --> 02:20:43.295]  And you're so censored.
[02:20:43.315 --> 02:20:44.035]  Where do we find you?
[02:20:44.295 --> 02:20:52.159]  Well, you can find me on Instagram at leonardosfunny, YouTube at leonardosfunny, and then go to my website, leonardosfunny.com.
[02:20:52.479 --> 02:20:59.702]  I'm actually going to be doing a show in Austin on October 10th, but I cannot publish the ticket link because they got my ticket link taken down.
[02:21:00.083 --> 02:21:04.765]  And so you have to sign up through my website, put your email in, and you will get a private ticket link.
[02:21:05.424 --> 02:21:07.544]  The left just harasses us at every level.
[02:21:07.584 --> 02:21:09.705]  I mean, I don't even usually talk about 10% of it on air.
[02:21:09.725 --> 02:21:10.965]  We just had some more of it yesterday.
[02:21:10.985 --> 02:21:12.385]  I'm not sure I'm going to talk about it yet.
[02:21:12.405 --> 02:21:13.166]  We'll see what happens.
[02:21:13.206 --> 02:21:15.426]  But it is just nonstop.
[02:21:15.446 --> 02:21:16.406]  These people are terrorists.
[02:21:16.686 --> 02:21:21.507]  Yeah, well, because we're saying things that are actually true, and you can't fight against the truth.
[02:21:21.867 --> 02:21:25.728]  So the only way to fight against the truth is to silence the person speaking it.
[02:21:26.008 --> 02:21:34.610]  And that's why supporting, whether it's comics or talk show hosts or political leaders that are being attacked, if someone's under attack, you should be supporting them because they're supporting your rights and your future.
[02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:35.090]  Right.
[02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:38.093]  And so I'd like to ask for your help, actually, Alex, if you're okay with it.
[02:21:38.353 --> 02:21:46.100]  I'd like to appeal to Elon Musk personally and ask him if he could go ahead and unban my account and take a look at this mass reporting.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:47.101]  I was about to go there.
[02:21:47.141 --> 02:21:49.203]  You got to do it earlier, but recap that and explain.
[02:21:49.223 --> 02:21:51.905]  I was about to say, you're not on X. That's horse crap.
[02:21:52.305 --> 02:21:53.747]  Elon, we're firing the badge signal.
[02:21:54.198 --> 02:21:57.761]  Yeah, Elon, please go ahead and take a look at what was my account.
[02:21:57.861 --> 02:21:59.422]  You'll see that there's plenty of comedy.
[02:21:59.783 --> 02:22:01.284]  I'm sure you're going to love those jokes.
[02:22:01.644 --> 02:22:14.135]  And I'm just asking you to go ahead and unban my account, as well as several accounts that were the targets of mass reporting, and also to undo this mass reporting system that ends up in people being deplatformed and demonetized.
[02:22:14.795 --> 02:22:15.316]  Damn right.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:18.121]  And what was your account, so he can get the handle?
[02:22:18.341 --> 02:22:24.783]  It's LEONARDAISFUN and then the letter E. LEONARDAISFUN, letter E. Yes.
[02:22:25.663 --> 02:22:26.283]  All right, folks.
[02:22:27.383 --> 02:22:28.464]  I can make some phone calls.
[02:22:29.084 --> 02:22:35.486]  I mean, take... I'm not saying we did it, but they... I mean, it was Naomi Wolf got... Somebody hacked her account, took it over.
[02:22:35.526 --> 02:22:37.687]  She couldn't get help through customer service for about two weeks.
[02:22:38.267 --> 02:22:39.087]  We fired the bad signal.
[02:22:39.107 --> 02:22:40.087]  It was turned on a few days later.
[02:22:40.227 --> 02:22:40.708]  Well, thank you.
[02:22:40.728 --> 02:22:41.788]  I really appreciate that.
[02:22:42.028 --> 02:22:46.911]  Well, I mean, Elon definitely, I mean, uh, he, I mean, I can get ahold of his people.
[02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:50.954]  So tell you who else can literally get them is, is, is of all people, Jack Posobiec.
[02:22:51.594 --> 02:22:54.476]  Uh, because when we got brought back on, they were still blocking us.
[02:22:54.536 --> 02:22:56.117]  And then he made some calls that turned it back on.
[02:22:56.717 --> 02:23:02.181]  So it's, it's, it's quite the process, but it proves that Elon is in control, but people, he's got all these employees.
[02:23:02.321 --> 02:23:03.322]  Well, you have to delegate.
[02:23:03.342 --> 02:23:03.882]  What is he going to do?
[02:23:03.902 --> 02:23:05.844]  He's going to look at every single appeal himself.
[02:23:05.904 --> 02:23:06.725]  He's a busy man.
[02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:11.849]  But it's important for us free speech advocates to stick together and to advocate for each other.
[02:23:12.329 --> 02:23:18.634]  I went to bat for Barry Stanton, who was taken down because he was making very funny jokes that some people found offensive.
[02:23:19.035 --> 02:23:21.657]  And then, because I went to bat, they targeted me.
[02:23:22.017 --> 02:23:32.781]  But I knew that they were going to do that, and I knew that it was important to go to bat for other people who have been censored, because what they will do is silence everyone until there's nobody left to speak up, and we can't allow that to happen.
[02:23:33.761 --> 02:23:34.761]  I played the clip earlier.
[02:23:35.482 --> 02:23:43.925]  Democrat officials, members of Congress, Hillary Clinton, I played her, saying we're going to put Trump supporters when we win the election in 2024 in re-education camps.
[02:23:45.225 --> 02:23:50.687]  I mean, the stuff they say is so totalitarian, but to me it shows how desperate they are that they're having to be honest.
[02:23:51.226 --> 02:23:58.650]  Well, what we have here is basically the same thing that you had in, you know, communist Russia, what you have in communist China.
[02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:00.530]  These are communist playbooks.
[02:24:00.811 --> 02:24:02.391]  They're doing a color revolution.
[02:24:02.712 --> 02:24:05.913]  They're dividing people along racial and class lines.
[02:24:06.453 --> 02:24:12.436]  They are inciting hatred and encouraging people to report and rat on each other.
[02:24:12.736 --> 02:24:15.017]  I mean, this is communism 101, Alex.
[02:24:15.057 --> 02:24:16.138]  We saw this in Russia.
[02:24:16.498 --> 02:24:18.259]  Children turning in their own parents.
[02:24:18.619 --> 02:24:20.220]  Children killing their own parents.
[02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:22.261]  We can't allow this to happen here.
[02:24:37.810 --> 02:24:45.579]  This was put up last week in Springfield, Ohio, where they brought in 20,000 plus Haitians, mainly military age men, that are just running around like day of the dead.
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:52.166]  Car accidents, murders, death, house cats, dogs, geese, ducks, they're just all being eaten.
[02:24:52.186 --> 02:24:53.768]  It's all on video.
[02:24:54.669 --> 02:24:58.253]  Report hate crimes, and here it is in Creole.
[02:24:59.378 --> 02:25:07.824]  And it's 1-800-CALL-FBI-TIPS-DOT-FBI-DOT-GOV so they can get some victims here who are Haitian.
[02:25:08.425 --> 02:25:14.810]  And then the governor comes out and says, well, actually, the 30 anti-Haitian bomb threats we've gotten are coming from overseas.
[02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:19.853]  That's obviously the Democrats, in my view, bouncing it off an IP protector.
[02:25:20.234 --> 02:25:22.595]  So they can then be the victims and make it all about the poor Haitians.
[02:25:22.896 --> 02:25:25.878]  But people are seeing through this Jussie Smollett-type crap.
[02:25:27.102 --> 02:25:30.845]  Well, you know, our government is occupied by people that hate us, Alex.
[02:25:31.045 --> 02:25:38.592]  I mean, you're putting up a sign for people who literally just got here, and you're telling them automatically, like, what's a hate crime?
[02:25:38.852 --> 02:25:41.054]  Haitians are murdering each other in Haiti.
[02:25:41.314 --> 02:25:45.417]  They eat each other, but they come here and all of a sudden they're gonna know what a hate crime is?
[02:25:45.698 --> 02:25:47.379]  Give me a freaking break, okay?
[02:25:47.619 --> 02:25:49.681]  And by the way, they do eat each other there.
[02:25:49.721 --> 02:25:50.902]  Yeah, no, there's cannibalism.
[02:25:51.062 --> 02:25:54.225]  I can show you videos of them roasting people on spits in Haiti.
[02:25:54.505 --> 02:25:57.546]  Well, there was the big Haitian warlord that goes by the name of Barbecue.
[02:25:57.987 --> 02:25:59.307]  Why did they give him the name Barbecue?
[02:25:59.327 --> 02:26:01.768]  Because he's literally barbecuing his enemies.
[02:26:02.248 --> 02:26:03.069]  This is insane.
[02:26:03.369 --> 02:26:08.071]  This is a culture that's completely incompatible with American civilized society.
[02:26:08.371 --> 02:26:14.994]  This is a bioweapon that has been brought in intentionally to destroy what America is all about.
[02:26:16.795 --> 02:26:20.877]  Now, you were talking at some of your bits about the shots.
[02:26:22.321 --> 02:26:24.991]  They want to ban us for saying they were bad and didn't work and hurt people.
[02:26:25.031 --> 02:26:25.855]  That's all confirmed.
[02:26:25.895 --> 02:26:26.818]  They're the disinformation.
[02:26:27.372 --> 02:26:32.473]  I had a family member, Alex, who I was begging my family, please don't take this.
[02:26:32.653 --> 02:26:38.455]  I know you guys think I'm crazy, I'm the crazy conspiracy theorist, but I'm telling you I've done my research.
[02:26:38.855 --> 02:26:47.837]  Well, a family member, one of mine, took one of the shots, thank God, only took the first shot, but immediately, within like a week or two, started to have symptoms of myocarditis.
[02:26:48.177 --> 02:26:52.698]  Went to the doctor, they told him, yes, you have myocarditis, do not take the second shot.
[02:26:53.078 --> 02:26:54.979]  So this has personally affected me.
[02:26:55.019 --> 02:26:57.439]  So people say, I don't know anybody who got injured by the vaccine.
[02:26:57.900 --> 02:26:58.300]  I do.
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:00.520]  I know people who got injured by the vaccine.
[02:27:00.761 --> 02:27:02.601]  I know people who died from the vaccine.
[02:27:02.941 --> 02:27:06.422]  I know that this is actually causing havoc on people's health systems.
[02:27:07.383 --> 02:27:07.883]  Absolutely.
[02:27:08.891 --> 02:27:10.152]  And again, remember what I said earlier?
[02:27:10.212 --> 02:27:12.974]  They want to stop us from talking about the issue when it matters.
[02:27:13.235 --> 02:27:14.676]  We can talk about it now, right?
[02:27:14.896 --> 02:27:17.458]  Because everybody who was supposed to take it already took it.
[02:27:17.538 --> 02:27:18.919]  The damage has already been done.
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:20.240]  So we're free to talk about it.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.942]  That's not what it's important to talk about it.
[02:27:22.202 --> 02:27:28.107]  It was important to talk about this in 2020, when they were literally banning people for saying the word COVID.
[02:27:28.367 --> 02:27:29.208]  This is insane!
[02:27:30.365 --> 02:27:30.906]  Absolutely.
[02:27:31.366 --> 02:27:35.469]  Whenever you see me pointing at you off camera, we put clips of this in the videos we put out.
[02:27:35.689 --> 02:27:38.912]  Whatever the hottest stuff is, I'm like, boom, boom, boom, sign language.
[02:27:39.212 --> 02:27:40.213]  Put that clip up front.
[02:27:40.253 --> 02:27:41.214]  Put that clip up front.
[02:27:41.234 --> 02:27:41.694]  That's great.
[02:27:41.795 --> 02:27:42.695]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:43.236 --> 02:27:45.738]  I'm really passionate about this stuff because I care about people.
[02:27:46.418 --> 02:27:49.741]  My family came here from, they escaped a communist country.
[02:27:49.801 --> 02:27:52.404]  They know what it means to be oppressed and not be able to speak up.
[02:27:52.764 --> 02:27:55.386]  And I'm so grateful for everything America has done.
[02:27:55.887 --> 02:28:04.174]  I do not understand people who migrate to this country, hate it, and immediately try to change the culture to what they had in the country they just left.
[02:28:04.495 --> 02:28:07.617]  It's like, if your culture was so great, why the hell are you here?
[02:28:07.758 --> 02:28:10.880]  Well, we came out three years ago in Congress.
[02:28:11.601 --> 02:28:17.689]  That the Biden administration got caught saying in DHS, don't let the Cubans in, they tend to vote Republican.
[02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:20.913]  So something about them being brown, it's their political idea.
[02:28:20.953 --> 02:28:23.156]  Tell us about your family and the background, that's interesting.
[02:28:23.276 --> 02:28:25.318]  Yeah, well, I'm ethnically Albanian.
[02:28:25.619 --> 02:28:27.641]  I actually was born there.
[02:28:27.762 --> 02:28:29.624]  My family immigrated with me here when I was one.
[02:28:29.684 --> 02:28:30.525]  What was the persecution?
[02:28:30.545 --> 02:28:31.426]  Was it Muslims against you?
[02:28:45.203 --> 02:28:47.707]  Uh, well, no, actually what it was was the communist government.
[02:28:47.727 --> 02:28:51.211]  The communist government made it illegal for anybody to practice any religion.
[02:28:51.872 --> 02:28:56.999]  Um, you know, Albania has a history of being targeted because the land is in a very valuable part of the Balkans.
[02:28:57.059 --> 02:28:58.101]  It's a beautiful country.
[02:28:58.221 --> 02:28:59.282]  Highly recommend tourism.
[02:28:59.322 --> 02:29:00.544]  It's no longer communist.
[02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:01.345]  I'm told it's gorgeous.
[02:29:01.525 --> 02:29:02.886]  It's a beautiful country.
[02:29:02.926 --> 02:29:03.446]  It really is.
[02:29:03.486 --> 02:29:04.447]  And I love where I'm from.
[02:29:04.827 --> 02:29:09.169]  And I really wish that that had never happened because I could have grown up amongst my own people.
[02:29:09.509 --> 02:29:14.032]  But at the same time, I know that I've been given a tremendous opportunity being in America.
[02:29:14.132 --> 02:29:18.755]  And I believe that it's my duty, because of what has been given to me, to give back.
[02:29:18.855 --> 02:29:21.396]  And this is why I fight for the freedoms that were given to me.
[02:29:21.716 --> 02:29:23.077]  I don't take them for granted.
[02:29:23.437 --> 02:29:24.318]  I'm grateful for them.
[02:29:24.438 --> 02:29:28.420]  And I know that with that comes a duty and a responsibility to uphold them.
[02:29:29.998 --> 02:29:30.599]  Absolutely.
[02:29:30.999 --> 02:29:31.980]  I want to go see the Balkans.
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.061]  Everybody tells me it's gorgeous.
[02:29:33.461 --> 02:29:34.902]  It's a beautiful country.
[02:29:34.922 --> 02:29:36.163]  You should really go, Alex.
[02:29:36.243 --> 02:29:38.565]  I mean, I go every summer with my family.
[02:29:38.605 --> 02:29:39.646]  We have a great time.
[02:29:40.087 --> 02:29:41.968]  You know, we get connected to our roots.
[02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:43.469]  We see our family again.
[02:29:43.530 --> 02:29:47.313]  And then it also makes us, you know, by the second week, we're like, I can't wait for America.
[02:29:47.373 --> 02:29:48.454]  It's a wonderful country.
[02:29:49.777 --> 02:29:53.340]  Historically, though, that's like the main battleground between Islam and Christianity.
[02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:54.020]  That's correct.
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:56.081]  Albanians were the main battleground.
[02:29:56.181 --> 02:29:58.903]  Albanians are actually the ones who fought off the Ottoman Empire.
[02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:00.964]  We were a tiny, tiny country.
[02:30:01.285 --> 02:30:07.168]  We were led by our national hero, who is celebrated throughout Europe because of what he did, George Castriati.
[02:30:07.569 --> 02:30:09.330]  They have statues of him all over.
[02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:16.955]  He's the one who led the fight against the Ottoman Empire, even though they were three or four times the size of Albania, and effectively
[02:30:17.395 --> 02:30:19.657]  Kept the rest of Europe from becoming Muslim.
[02:30:20.097 --> 02:30:24.139]  And it's, it's, every country in the West recognizes him.
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:33.465]  And so, you know, I, I really, I mean, I love my people, you know, I think we're fantastic and I think we come here and we add to this country and we love what this country does and we become part of it.
[02:30:33.686 --> 02:30:41.571]  And people just 50 years ago, I don't know who he is, people knew who El Cid was and started La Reconquista, uh, in, in Spain that took 300 years.
[02:30:41.591 --> 02:30:45.133]  I mean, those are the guys that the reason we West even still exist.
[02:30:45.433 --> 02:30:45.633]  Right.
[02:30:45.833 --> 02:30:46.754]  These are the heroes.
[02:30:46.894 --> 02:30:48.816]  These are the heroes they're tearing down from us.
[02:30:49.136 --> 02:30:52.460]  They don't want us to have heroes like this because it inspires people.
[02:30:52.780 --> 02:31:02.188]  You hear the stories of these people who fought back against impossible odds and won, and it inspires something in the human spirit to say, I don't care what the odds are.
[02:31:02.449 --> 02:31:04.350]  I'm going to speak up and I'm going to fight.
[02:31:05.339 --> 02:31:12.829]  You know, like when Trump almost got assassinated, the first thing he did was stand up, pump his fists into the air and say, fight, fight, fight.
[02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:19.138]  I mean, that was a tremendous moment for anybody who loves freedom and knows what's happening in this country.
[02:31:21.533 --> 02:31:32.017]  People will remember that happened because there's so much entertainment, so much media, people, stuff that's real, they just mix it in mentally, psychologically, subconsciously, unconsciously, like it's just another Netflix show.
[02:31:32.077 --> 02:31:33.038]  No, that really happened.
[02:31:33.258 --> 02:31:34.138]  This is really going down.
[02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:34.998]  That really happened.
[02:31:35.018 --> 02:31:38.680]  And then you saw for the first time ever, the left became conspiracy theorists.
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:42.661]  Suddenly, when it's convenient for them, they're saying, oh, this whole thing was staged.
[02:31:42.942 --> 02:31:43.922]  That's not staged.
[02:31:44.282 --> 02:31:48.565]  Somebody does not get up with that kind of emotion and passion in a staged way.
[02:31:48.825 --> 02:31:52.647]  And that was a moment of inspiration for every American who believes in freedom.
[02:31:52.787 --> 02:31:53.848]  Well, they're also idiots.
[02:31:54.428 --> 02:32:00.752]  The left, people like Rosie O'Donnell and others, they held up full cartridges, you know, only the bullet goes out, and said, this hit his ear and blow it all off.
[02:32:00.792 --> 02:32:04.034]  No, I can sit there at 150 yards and shoot a watermelon.
[02:32:04.234 --> 02:32:04.995]  I'm a good enough shot.
[02:32:06.226 --> 02:32:09.550]  And I can just graze it just like his ear in a tiny slices there.
[02:32:09.931 --> 02:32:11.133]  It just nicked his ear.
[02:32:11.193 --> 02:32:11.373]  Right.
[02:32:11.513 --> 02:32:14.677]  It went by supersonically at 2,300, 2,500 feet per second.
[02:32:15.659 --> 02:32:21.006]  But if it hit his head, then the bullet explodes because of the kinetic force in the bone and would have blown the back of his head off.
[02:32:21.246 --> 02:32:26.910]  To me, that was a moment that really inspired my faith in God because it was like, what else could explain this?
[02:32:27.290 --> 02:32:29.112]  This is angelic protection.
[02:32:29.152 --> 02:32:34.435]  This is God saying, hey, I'm going to protect you if you fight for me and you fight for the truth.
[02:32:35.076 --> 02:32:39.059]  And I think, you know, people who say that because they're godless people, they don't have any faith.
[02:32:39.379 --> 02:32:41.520]  They want to demoralize people.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.842]  There's an anti-human element.
[02:32:44.282 --> 02:32:45.143]  No, you're right.
[02:32:45.163 --> 02:32:57.068]  People think of Albania fighting off the Islamists, or El Cid before that, or any of this, or the Polish folks that did it, as well as the Russians, the Moskowans, and they see that as 1,000 years ago, 800 years ago, 600 years ago, 500 years ago, 300 years ago.
[02:33:12.276 --> 02:33:13.837]  And they think, oh, that's ancient history.
[02:33:13.877 --> 02:33:16.639]  No, it's all the same fights just continue on.
[02:33:16.899 --> 02:33:20.041]  We just don't know it, and the UN is allied with all this against us.
[02:33:20.461 --> 02:33:25.465]  And they constantly want to take away your God-given rights.
[02:33:25.785 --> 02:33:31.369]  I heard Kyle in here earlier saying, my rights to freedom of speech, my right to defend myself comes from God.
[02:33:31.689 --> 02:33:38.413]  Well, that's why their first take was to remove God from our schools, from our national consciousness, from our belief system.
[02:33:38.673 --> 02:33:39.214]  Because then,
[02:33:39.614 --> 02:33:43.358]  We don't have a firm foundation against which to fight these people.
[02:33:43.678 --> 02:33:49.864]  Because if you say it comes from God, then you have every justification to defend yourself, defend your family, and defend your nation.
[02:33:51.890 --> 02:33:56.732]  I spoke about this briefly before the break, but growing up, my parents wouldn't be conservative or liberal.
[02:33:56.752 --> 02:33:58.472]  They were just more populist, pro-Americans.
[02:33:59.393 --> 02:34:02.354]  And my mom's really smart and strong, so is my dad, and so are my grandmothers.
[02:34:02.374 --> 02:34:03.194]  They were just amazing.
[02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:05.795]  And I think about that.
[02:34:05.815 --> 02:34:06.935]  They were both very feminine.
[02:34:06.975 --> 02:34:11.117]  My dad's mother ran a ranch and a farm and was also a schoolteacher and a principal.
[02:34:11.741 --> 02:34:12.101]  We're good to go.
[02:34:12.121 --> 02:34:12.581]  We're good to go.
[02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:34.092]  Well, I'll tell you exactly what it is, Alex.
[02:34:34.472 --> 02:34:35.854]  Women are vulnerable creatures.
[02:34:35.974 --> 02:34:36.334]  We are.
[02:34:36.575 --> 02:34:36.835]  Okay?
[02:34:36.875 --> 02:34:37.356]  By nature.
[02:34:37.396 --> 02:34:38.557]  We can't fight off anything.
[02:34:38.637 --> 02:34:41.420]  And traditionally what it was, was our men protected us.
[02:34:41.881 --> 02:34:47.628]  The state specifically attacked that relationship through feminism, which you know was a CIA operation.
[02:34:47.648 --> 02:34:48.449]  Gloria Steinem.
[02:34:48.729 --> 02:34:52.152]  It was a way to set women against men, to make men the perpetrators.
[02:34:52.172 --> 02:34:57.217]  They took a few examples, because we know there were bad men, there were bad characters, and they said, this is what they all are.
[02:34:57.537 --> 02:34:58.738]  You have to be enemies of them.
[02:34:59.079 --> 02:35:01.101]  And so then the women are like, well, what am I going to do?
[02:35:01.161 --> 02:35:01.981]  Who's going to protect me?
[02:35:02.402 --> 02:35:03.363]  In comes the state.
[02:35:03.763 --> 02:35:05.604]  Don't worry, we got you.
[02:35:05.964 --> 02:35:06.825]  We got your back.
[02:35:07.105 --> 02:35:08.866]  Well, ladies, take a look around.
[02:35:09.227 --> 02:35:22.155]  Do they have your back, or have they brought in people from cultures who disrespect women constantly, see women as nothing but sex objects, feel like they have an absolute right to a woman's body and you have no right to do anything about that?
[02:35:22.655 --> 02:35:25.797]  Is this really the protection that you were promised, or were you duped?
[02:35:26.097 --> 02:35:28.839]  And if you realize that you were duped, you have a duty to wake up
[02:35:29.079 --> 02:35:34.613]  You have a duty to speak out and you have a duty to lead women off the path that you know has led to your own destruction.
[02:35:35.868 --> 02:35:38.050]  Well, I'll vote for you for the Senator President right now.
[02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:39.230]  That's another thing.
[02:35:39.591 --> 02:35:46.636]  There's lots of super smart, awesome women that are in leadership positions, but if you look at the left, the women they put forward, the men too, can't even talk.
[02:35:46.676 --> 02:35:47.496]  What do you make of Kamala?
[02:35:47.576 --> 02:35:49.257]  I mean, she's so stupid.
[02:35:50.478 --> 02:35:52.680]  A fifth grader could do better than her.
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:59.725]  Well, I think the strategy on their half is because they know she's going to put her foot in her mouth anytime she speaks, so they just have her laugh like a hyena.
[02:36:01.488 --> 02:36:05.211]  And then you don't really have any clips of her.
[02:36:05.251 --> 02:36:06.472]  She's totally fraudulent.
[02:36:06.533 --> 02:36:08.474]  She's like a brown Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:08.855 --> 02:36:12.538]  Oh, look, we're giving it to you in a new flavor, which is what I feel like we had with Obama.
[02:36:12.838 --> 02:36:16.721]  Obama was just another neocon that they were like, oh, look, it's brown, though.
[02:36:16.862 --> 02:36:17.602]  It's different.
[02:36:17.903 --> 02:36:19.124]  It's all the same shit.
[02:36:20.044 --> 02:36:20.345]  It is.
[02:36:21.084 --> 02:36:25.888]  I will say that I get very passionate about this stuff because... You can cuss all you want, we can lay it out.
[02:36:26.048 --> 02:36:31.233]  I will tell you this, you know, I actually used to be a liberal, I used to be a feminist, I used to believe all of this stuff.
[02:36:31.513 --> 02:36:35.416]  And then I started diving into things and I had this feeling inside, something's not right.
[02:36:35.736 --> 02:36:42.522]  And through what I did, my own research and opening up to seeing what the truth was, I pulled myself out of that ideology.
[02:36:42.562 --> 02:36:44.524]  I realized how much I had been brainwashed.
[02:36:44.864 --> 02:36:48.286]  And since that time, I've made it my mission to speak out against those things.
[02:36:49.026 --> 02:36:50.387]  I talk to women individually.
[02:36:50.727 --> 02:36:51.867]  I talk to them publicly.
[02:36:52.187 --> 02:36:53.968]  I tell them, hey, these are lies.
[02:36:54.228 --> 02:36:55.549]  There is joy in motherhood.
[02:36:55.589 --> 02:37:00.491]  There's joy in being a loving, caring wife who values and respects your husband.
[02:37:00.551 --> 02:37:05.553]  It's not demeaning to make a meal for a man who's literally willing to die for you.
[02:37:06.014 --> 02:37:13.657]  You must look at both sides of the equation before you start arguing about inequality and how you're being taken advantage of and oppressed.
[02:37:13.797 --> 02:37:16.958]  The point is, we're designed a certain way, and it's that way in the entire animal kingdom.
[02:37:17.298 --> 02:37:25.281]  What a lovely thing to have a man who wants to work for you, bring home the bacon, if you will, take care of you, protect you.
[02:37:25.561 --> 02:37:37.486]  Look at, I mean, you know, we were all under the illusion that women could do anything, and then the attempted assassination on Donald Trump happened, and we watched those female Secret Service officers just fall back into their natural state of women.
[02:37:37.506 --> 02:37:40.987]  I mean, one of them ducked behind President Trump so he could protect her.
[02:37:41.727 --> 02:37:44.010]  This goes to show you, we're not designed for that.
[02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:47.734]  I don't want to put my life on the line for a man, unless it's my own child.
[02:37:47.754 --> 02:37:48.594]  Well, it's statistical.
[02:37:48.634 --> 02:37:50.977]  There's always a percentage of women that are warriors.
[02:37:51.317 --> 02:37:52.679]  And women, when they have to be, can fight.
[02:37:53.059 --> 02:37:54.501]  But it's just not the natural state.
[02:37:54.904 --> 02:37:58.567]  It's not, and it's an undue burden that's being placed on women.
[02:37:58.687 --> 02:37:59.828]  Now they want to draft women.
[02:37:59.868 --> 02:38:02.670]  They're starting in Ukraine, they want to draft women here.
[02:38:03.010 --> 02:38:06.273]  I got three daughters, Anna, so you're not drafting jack crap.
[02:38:07.254 --> 02:38:10.877]  It's great, you know, but that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
[02:38:10.897 --> 02:38:15.040]  There is an anti-woman sentiment in the country.
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:17.382]  Everything is upside down with these people.
[02:38:17.682 --> 02:38:18.702]  And they say it's pro-woman.
[02:38:18.742 --> 02:38:19.603]  It's obviously targeting.
[02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:20.663]  Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[02:38:20.703 --> 02:38:31.626]  They told women one of the biggest lies of feminism was the quote-unquote sexual liberation in which women were encouraged to go ahead and freely give their bodies away to men who gave them nothing in return.
[02:38:32.026 --> 02:38:34.287]  Talk about an upside-down message.
[02:38:36.147 --> 02:38:44.113]  And now in Germany, they make women who are on welfare become prostitutes, and then if they won't have sex with certain men, they get fined.
[02:38:44.133 --> 02:38:44.734]  Did you see that?
[02:38:44.914 --> 02:38:47.015]  I did not see that.
[02:38:49.237 --> 02:38:51.959]  German government forcing women on welfare into prostitution.
[02:38:52.219 --> 02:38:53.300]  They'll take them off if they don't do it.
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:54.061]  They say, you can do this.
[02:38:54.641 --> 02:38:59.205]  And German government working with pimps to make them see more Johns.
[02:38:59.225 --> 02:39:00.966]  Like if they refuse 10 a day, they get in trouble.
[02:39:01.246 --> 02:39:02.006]  Well, this is insane.
[02:39:02.026 --> 02:39:02.647]  You think I'm joking?
[02:39:02.667 --> 02:39:03.247]  I swear to God.
[02:39:03.307 --> 02:39:04.067]  I don't think you're joking.
[02:39:04.087 --> 02:39:05.108]  Well, it doesn't even sound real.
[02:39:05.388 --> 02:39:21.336]  It doesn't sound real, but if we study history, if people would just study history, this was happening in the Weimar Republic, this was happening in Bolshevik Russia, this is happening in any place in which these anti-human demons are allowed to take control of the powers of government.
[02:39:22.596 --> 02:39:23.397]  That's your new freedom.
[02:39:24.502 --> 02:39:26.523]  Yeah, you have the freedom to sell your body.
[02:39:26.563 --> 02:39:27.644]  I mean, we have it here, Alex.
[02:39:27.864 --> 02:39:34.007]  Look at how many Girls Gone Only fans and sell images of themselves because they're worshiping, oh, I can make millions of dollars.
[02:39:34.207 --> 02:39:39.570]  And I like to tell these women, no matter how much money you make, you're never going to make enough to buy back your dignity.
[02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:41.311]  But most of them don't even make that much money.
[02:39:41.351 --> 02:39:42.072]  It's like Hollywood.
[02:39:42.192 --> 02:39:45.595]  Everybody runs to go do it, and then it's, it's, and then, oh, well, that's not making money.
[02:39:45.615 --> 02:39:46.376]  Well, now I'll do this.
[02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:46.796]  Right.
[02:39:46.856 --> 02:39:47.457]  Now I'll do that.
[02:39:47.517 --> 02:39:48.097]  Now I'll do that.
[02:39:48.177 --> 02:39:49.839]  And the left promoted Fifty Shades of Grey.
[02:39:50.219 --> 02:39:54.382]  The rich man puts you in bondage, and then girls go out and do that and actually get beat up or killed.
[02:39:54.522 --> 02:39:54.803]  Right.
[02:39:54.923 --> 02:39:57.545]  And it's, and it's completely traumatizing to people.
[02:39:57.585 --> 02:39:58.466]  Look, London Telegraph, see?
[02:39:59.403 --> 02:40:01.865]  If you don't take a job as a prostitute, we can stop your benefits.
[02:40:01.885 --> 02:40:02.485]  That's Germany.
[02:40:02.846 --> 02:40:12.533]  And then now, that was a couple years ago, as I saw it again a few years ago, that's 2005, but it was, now it's the law in a bunch of different states in Germany and some other, I think France is doing it in areas.
[02:40:12.613 --> 02:40:17.717]  And then I saw a few months ago, they're now making them see 10 men a day and they cannot refuse the Muslims.
[02:40:17.797 --> 02:40:18.558]  I swear to God.
[02:40:18.918 --> 02:40:19.118]  Right.
[02:40:19.138 --> 02:40:19.959]  Well, there you go.
[02:40:20.319 --> 02:40:21.019]  There you go.
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:21.440]  Right?
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:24.042]  If you don't see this guy, I'm going to break your nose.
[02:40:24.622 --> 02:40:34.445]  It's completely, it's that whole thing when they say any kind of recognition of, hey, I don't want, I recognize you as a different race or a different culture than mine.
[02:40:34.905 --> 02:40:37.925]  Oh, you're racist and we have the right to persecute you.
[02:40:38.206 --> 02:40:38.926]  This is insane.
[02:40:38.966 --> 02:40:51.429]  I can show you, I don't know if you know about this, women, liberal women, they stopped a few years ago because they got smart, would go to these racial diversity, culture diversity things, they're mainly Muslim men, they would get, this video, gang raped.
[02:40:52.487 --> 02:40:53.207]  I know about this.
[02:40:53.508 --> 02:40:59.950]  I mean, the women would go there by themselves and the men would just... It's like literally sending a mouse onto the mousetrap.
[02:41:00.291 --> 02:41:07.554]  Well, this is what happens because the women in this culture, you know, have been protected by strong men who do not abuse their strength.
[02:41:07.894 --> 02:41:12.116]  And so they live in this bubble where they think, oh, this is how it is all over the world.
[02:41:12.376 --> 02:41:15.337]  And why can't you just, you know, be embracing of these other cultures?
[02:41:15.357 --> 02:41:21.780]  And I'm like, all you have to do is pick up a textbook or a newspaper and see the treatment that women get in these cultures and ask yourself, is that what you want?
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:31.445]  Under Islam, a beautiful woman, dressed nice like you are, in Cairo, in anywhere, would either be beat up, stoned, or killed or raped in five minutes.
[02:41:32.045 --> 02:41:34.286]  It's not just Islam, right?
[02:41:34.406 --> 02:41:38.788]  It's any one of these third world countries, these cultures.
[02:41:38.808 --> 02:41:39.689]  No, you're right.
[02:41:39.949 --> 02:41:43.430]  I mean, Haiti is a 97% Christian country.
[02:41:43.691 --> 02:41:45.852]  Do you see them having the same values as we do?
[02:41:46.172 --> 02:41:46.412]  No.
[02:41:46.752 --> 02:41:49.834]  There's something to be said about the culture itself.
[02:41:49.974 --> 02:41:50.574]  It's really voodoo.
[02:41:52.214 --> 02:41:53.675]  India is mostly Hindu.
[02:41:54.056 --> 02:41:56.538]  Women there can't even take the train without getting groped.
[02:41:56.558 --> 02:41:58.701]  Well, there's a big thing where they'll kill two or three wives.
[02:41:58.721 --> 02:42:03.306]  They usually throw gasoline on them because the family has to pay to get you to marry the woman.
[02:42:04.517 --> 02:42:05.337]  Dowry killings.
[02:42:05.718 --> 02:42:06.058]  Wow.
[02:42:06.618 --> 02:42:06.878]  Wow.
[02:42:07.199 --> 02:42:16.944]  That's absolutely... Yeah, the family comes, and sometimes the mother does it of the son, and they'll throw a cup of, usually a coffee can of gasoline on her, and they light her.
[02:42:17.304 --> 02:42:17.484]  Right.
[02:42:17.544 --> 02:42:22.047]  So this is the stuff that I was reporting on, and then a particular group of Indians didn't like it.
[02:42:22.087 --> 02:42:23.368]  They said, oh, that's racist.
[02:42:23.668 --> 02:42:25.449]  I said, it's racist to report on the truth.
[02:42:25.849 --> 02:42:28.290]  It's dehumane what you're doing to women in your culture.
[02:42:28.671 --> 02:42:29.191]  Didn't matter.
[02:42:29.511 --> 02:42:33.335]  Leonardo, Joni, um, and what's the website again?
[02:42:33.495 --> 02:42:36.558]  The website is leonardaisfunny.com.
[02:42:36.578 --> 02:42:39.361]  leonardaisfunny.com and spell Leonardo?
[02:42:39.662 --> 02:42:44.406]  Yep, like Leonardo with an A. My family thought they were having a boy, so I surprised them.
[02:42:44.887 --> 02:42:45.387]  Hey, it's great.
[02:42:45.588 --> 02:42:46.428]  I never heard the name Leonardo.
[02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.809]  I like it.
[02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.610]  Thank you.
[02:42:48.396 --> 02:42:50.636]  All right, well, we're going to have to have you... Listen, you're in Austin.
[02:42:50.796 --> 02:42:51.417]  I am in Austin.
[02:42:51.437 --> 02:42:52.097]  How long have you been here?
[02:42:52.557 --> 02:42:54.497]  I've been here for three and a half years, actually.
[02:42:54.517 --> 02:42:55.837]  I came for comedy.
[02:42:55.877 --> 02:42:58.038]  I came for... Because Joe Rogan put out the BPA.
[02:42:58.118 --> 02:43:00.338]  He said, this is free... Where's your next show at?
[02:43:00.598 --> 02:43:02.598]  My show is going to... It's a secret location.
[02:43:02.638 --> 02:43:04.499]  I cannot publish it because they are harassing.
[02:43:04.519 --> 02:43:05.259]  I'm not kidding.
[02:43:05.299 --> 02:43:06.059]  Good God.
[02:43:06.099 --> 02:43:07.779]  Yeah, I told you, I'm literally... Well, what's the date?
[02:43:07.799 --> 02:43:08.379]  I'll probably come.
[02:43:08.479 --> 02:43:10.280]  It's October 10th, and it's in Austin.
[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:11.960]  And I'll send you information.
[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:12.520]  I'm going to be there.
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:12.860]  All right.
[02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:14.100]  And you've got to come back on the other shows.
[02:43:14.220 --> 02:43:14.861]  I would love to.
[02:43:15.001 --> 02:43:17.121]  I've seen the other shows, and you're always out of town.
[02:43:17.492 --> 02:43:17.793]  All right.
[02:43:17.833 --> 02:43:18.674]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:43:18.974 --> 02:43:19.615]  All right.
[02:43:20.196 --> 02:43:21.778]  Leonardo Joni, thank you so much.
[02:43:21.798 --> 02:43:23.040]  People should definitely check her out.
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:24.922]  We're going to get her back on X. All right.
[02:43:24.942 --> 02:43:27.045]  We're going to come back with some key intel.
[02:43:27.366 --> 02:43:29.228]  And Maria Z takes over.
[02:43:29.469 --> 02:43:30.050]  Stay with us.
[02:43:31.472 --> 02:43:34.175]  I'm asking viewers to just sit back for a moment.
[02:43:35.177 --> 02:43:38.520]  And really think about the success InfoWars has had.
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:40.201]  And InfoWars isn't just me.
[02:43:40.241 --> 02:43:40.982]  It's not just the crew.
[02:43:41.022 --> 02:43:42.403]  It's not just our guests.
[02:43:43.344 --> 02:43:48.628]  It's all of you, the viewers and listeners that give us intel, that spread the word, that support the broadcast.
[02:43:49.348 --> 02:43:53.392]  In the 30-year history of me being on air and 27 years of InfoWars,
[02:43:53.992 --> 02:43:59.674]  We have changed the world, and because we researched the globalist-owned documents, we knew their game plan.
[02:43:59.774 --> 02:44:03.035]  I didn't learn all this stuff out of some Palantir crystal ball.
[02:44:03.155 --> 02:44:16.859]  I did it by reading the books and publications that these creatures put out, because they communicate with each other and are very honest about their diabolical plan for world government, depopulation, transhumanism, total robot control.
[02:44:17.419 --> 02:44:19.000]  And I believe in humanity.
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:24.881]  I bet on you because I was betting on myself and I know that it's always darkest right before the dawn.
[02:44:25.641 --> 02:44:38.585]  And so now in 2024, so close to the selection, it is more critical than ever to not just keep InfoWars on the air, but to not take the reports and the videos and the articles and the interviews and to get those out to everybody you know.
[02:44:39.245 --> 02:44:45.467]  I understand that's really stating the obvious, but we have to understand how urgent the moment is and really redouble our efforts.
[02:44:45.787 --> 02:44:46.907]  And I'm saying that myself.
[02:44:46.987 --> 02:44:48.547]  I'm on the air seven days a week.
[02:44:48.567 --> 02:44:49.628]  I'm doing a lot of interviews.
[02:44:49.648 --> 02:44:51.248]  I'm doing more special reports.
[02:44:51.268 --> 02:44:52.348]  We're going out in the field.
[02:44:52.789 --> 02:44:58.130]  We are busting our ass because the future destiny of humanity is really on the line right now.
[02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:04.834]  Now, a critical part of InfoWars continuing on, and hopefully even expanding into the future, is your support.
[02:45:04.974 --> 02:45:06.134]  We make it so easy.

[02:45:54.653 --> 02:45:55.954]  You need to check it out for yourself.
[02:45:56.014 --> 02:45:59.097]  You hear the callers talking about it all the time without me even prompting them.
[02:45:59.477 --> 02:46:00.498]  It is amazing.
[02:46:00.838 --> 02:46:04.841]  Then you've got Joint Relief Max that is a natural pain reliever.
[02:46:04.882 --> 02:46:06.843]  Works really, really well in a healthy way.
[02:46:06.863 --> 02:46:07.664]  You have Turmeric 95, 95% curcuminoid.

[02:46:19.850 --> 02:46:20.410]  25 milligrams.
[02:46:20.490 --> 02:46:21.771]  Great anti-inflammatory.
[02:46:22.111 --> 02:46:26.513]  Isn't a downer, isn't a depressant, but makes you very relaxed and focused.
[02:46:26.553 --> 02:46:29.014]  It's almost like a stimulant in a weird way, but...
[02:46:29.694 --> 02:46:30.195]  It's different.
[02:46:30.555 --> 02:46:33.358]  And then, of course, we've got other great products for women and men.

[02:46:50.395 --> 02:46:51.615]  We sell it, then they discount it.

[02:47:39.665 --> 02:47:45.728]  Some public schools and libraries invite drag queens, some dressed like torn demons, to read to young children.
[02:47:58.553 --> 02:48:02.075]  Parents' rights are limited, and children's rights are put ahead.
[02:48:02.496 --> 02:48:07.259]  So the child has the right to be protected from the parents when the parents behave badly.
[02:48:07.279 --> 02:48:11.862]  Yeah, that child molester just messed with the wrong preschooler.
[02:48:15.064 --> 02:48:16.905]  What makes you think he's a child molester?
[02:48:17.505 --> 02:48:19.126]  Oh, he's a child molester, believe me.
[02:48:19.767 --> 02:48:22.969]  Every child molester I've ever met looks just like that.
[02:48:31.864 --> 02:48:33.945]  We'll convert your children.
[02:48:33.985 --> 02:48:34.225]  What?
[02:48:35.386 --> 02:48:42.110]  Happens bit by bit, quietly and subtly, and you will barely notice it.
[02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:50.094]  You can keep him from disco, warn about San Francisco, make him wear pleated pants, we don't care.
[02:48:50.729 --> 02:48:55.893]  And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan who just wing it, who make it up as they go along.
[02:48:56.213 --> 02:49:06.001]  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don't trust real newsrooms, we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, Kate.
[02:49:06.101 --> 02:49:08.863]  But that's what's at the heart of this... Damn it.
[02:49:09.183 --> 02:49:10.884]  Everything on TV sucks.
[02:49:11.865 --> 02:49:13.206]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:49:21.604 --> 02:49:21.725]  Cool!
[02:49:21.785 --> 02:49:23.831]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[02:49:23.851 --> 02:49:24.012]  Fire!
[02:49:24.032 --> 02:49:24.313]  Fire!
[02:49:24.373 --> 02:49:24.674]  Fire!
[02:49:43.482 --> 02:49:43.782]  Hello?
[02:49:44.323 --> 02:49:45.083]  You piece of sh**!
[02:49:45.684 --> 02:49:47.205]  You f****** damn f******!
[02:49:47.625 --> 02:49:48.566]  Listen, f****** kid!
[02:49:48.966 --> 02:49:50.388]  You f****** crossed the line!
[02:49:51.068 --> 02:49:53.670]  Get that through your f****** damn f****** head!
[02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:55.952]  Stop pushing your sh**!
[02:49:56.292 --> 02:49:59.815]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[02:50:00.095 --> 02:50:02.577]  You just get that through your stinking traitorous heads!
[02:50:03.458 --> 02:50:07.581]  But I will stomp your head in if you start a fight with me, you thug scum!
[02:50:07.881 --> 02:50:09.343]  You think I'm a coward like you?! !
[02:50:11.383 --> 02:50:18.409]  Uh... I... We're... Uh... Whoa!
[02:50:19.130 --> 02:50:21.872]  I just got invited to give the commencement address at Harvard this year.
[02:50:22.072 --> 02:50:23.033]  That's amazing!
[02:50:23.774 --> 02:50:24.354]  I'm gay!
[02:50:38.773 --> 02:50:39.154]  Alright.
[02:50:39.174 --> 02:50:41.356]  Do you get to wear the hat and everything?
[02:50:41.576 --> 02:50:42.758]  Yeah, you better!
[02:50:42.778 --> 02:50:43.258]  Don't worry.
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:45.681]  Hello?
[02:50:51.659 --> 02:50:52.860]  I see you, enemy!
[02:50:53.401 --> 02:50:53.841]  Enemy!
[02:50:54.402 --> 02:50:54.862]  Enemy!
[02:50:55.163 --> 02:50:56.484]  You are my enemy!
[02:50:57.045 --> 02:50:57.986]  You will pay.
[02:50:58.226 --> 02:50:59.948]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[02:51:00.148 --> 02:51:01.149]  You don't think I don't see you?
[02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:02.291]  I see you.
[02:51:02.311 --> 02:51:03.492]  You understand me?
[02:51:03.612 --> 02:51:05.474]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[02:51:05.855 --> 02:51:06.435]  I see you.
[02:51:06.656 --> 02:51:07.096]  Right back.
[02:51:07.276 --> 02:51:08.318]  You understand that?
[02:51:08.358 --> 02:51:09.559]  You understand that?
[02:51:16.681 --> 02:51:17.041]  No!
[02:51:17.261 --> 02:51:19.603]  You will not bring humanity down!
[02:51:20.183 --> 02:51:23.025]  God is going to destroy you!
[02:51:56.733 --> 02:51:59.034]  A biological attack is imminent!
[02:51:59.814 --> 02:52:00.194]  Imminent!
[02:52:00.454 --> 02:52:01.295]  It's going to happen.
[02:52:01.535 --> 02:52:05.116]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[02:52:05.336 --> 02:52:16.760]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:23.342]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[02:52:34.938 --> 02:52:41.023]  If you want your shot to own this piece of pure Americana, the most powerful, amazing truck in the world today, it's real simple.

[02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:06.062]  What really matters is the shocks, the giant tires, the engine.
[02:53:06.382 --> 02:53:09.685]  Folks, I've had a lot of big trucks, but I'm telling you, they don't even compare to this.
[02:53:10.085 --> 02:53:10.686]  Be part of this.

[02:53:16.991 --> 02:53:17.591]  I'll see you there.
[02:53:17.872 --> 02:53:20.214]  And I can't wait to find out who the lucky winner is going to be.
[02:53:22.355 --> 02:53:23.877]  I'm telling you, this is better than sex.
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:27.802]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:27.922 --> 02:53:37.570]  I'm your guest host Maria Z of zmedia.com and it is an honor to be with you all here today broadcasting live from the studios.
[02:53:37.990 --> 02:53:45.777]  It's an honor to be sitting in the seat of this absolute legend who has changed the course of human history, waking up the masses.
[02:53:46.417 --> 02:53:58.483]  To the assault on humanity, the New World Order that seeks to subjugate every single one of us under its thumb, bring us into a system where we cannot breathe without being monitored and potentially taxed for our breath.
[02:53:59.864 --> 02:54:11.288]  I'm in a very, very unique position because I come from a country, Australia, that is a lot further down the line of where these people want to take every single country.
[02:54:11.988 --> 02:54:13.028]  America's not there yet.
[02:54:13.628 --> 02:54:19.871]  As bad as it is right now, and as bad as they want to make it, you are not there yet.
[02:54:19.951 --> 02:54:20.891]  And thank God for that.
[02:54:21.511 --> 02:54:36.048]  And I thank God for the fact that I'm in this unique position so that I can warn Americans everywhere that I go on every broadcast that God gives me the strength to do of what will happen to your country if you allow these people to take over.
[02:54:37.222 --> 02:54:52.230]  This isn't me preaching at you, it's me saying I've lived it, I know what it looks like, just a few years down the road, and I know what the psychology behind what they're doing to get you there looks like.
[02:54:53.531 --> 02:54:55.212]  And I'm able to issue that warning.
[02:54:57.938 --> 02:55:07.284]  Many people ask me, how did they get away with, not to resurrect history here, but how did they get away with the things that I got away with during COVID in Australia?
[02:55:07.344 --> 02:55:08.865]  They watched the scenes in horror.
[02:55:09.145 --> 02:55:12.568]  They watched the police shooting at innocent protesters with rubber bullets.
[02:55:12.828 --> 02:55:21.814]  They watched people being assaulted, women being choked up against the wall by maniac police officers because she wasn't wearing a mask.
[02:55:21.854 --> 02:55:24.916]  They watched those scenes and they say, how did you let them get away with it?
[02:55:26.311 --> 02:55:31.358]  And a lot of the time they'll say, oh, would you let them take your guns or, you know, that's that's the main argument.
[02:55:31.418 --> 02:55:32.299]  That's the main argument.
[02:55:32.339 --> 02:55:36.625]  But I will tell you that it is so much more than the missing link.
[02:55:37.605 --> 02:55:40.888]  That a lot of people think is the problem with Australia.
[02:55:40.968 --> 02:55:47.293]  It is the psychology that was deployed on the Australian population over years and years and years.
[02:55:47.353 --> 02:55:51.816]  And it is the same psychology that I am seeing now, except it's tenfold.
[02:55:52.197 --> 02:55:53.898]  Because this was done in the shadows.
[02:55:53.938 --> 02:55:57.461]  This was done in a way that seemed like it was good for humanity.
[02:55:57.901 --> 02:55:59.422]  Like, it's really good.
[02:55:59.462 --> 02:56:01.044]  We don't want a violent society.
[02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:05.547]  These days, you've got Hillary Clinton and others flat out calling
[02:56:06.604 --> 02:56:12.210]  To ramp up the rhetoric against Donald Trump when he's just had two assassination attempts.
[02:56:14.353 --> 02:56:19.238]  These people are doubling down, meanwhile telling you, here's what they're doing with the narrative.
[02:56:19.619 --> 02:56:24.044]  Oh, do you see why we need to ban assault weapons?
[02:56:24.104 --> 02:56:25.345]  What is an assault weapon?
[02:56:25.365 --> 02:56:27.188]  Can someone please define it for me?
[02:56:30.245 --> 02:56:37.451]  In the same breath, telling you we need to disarm you while we conduct political violence on our political opponents.
[02:56:40.133 --> 02:56:44.336]  This is such a dangerous time for America, but you understand this.
[02:56:44.776 --> 02:56:46.618]  You understand how dangerous this is.
[02:56:46.978 --> 02:56:54.364]  Maybe what some people don't understand, particularly conservatives, is the psychology that is deployed on those who trust the government.
[02:56:56.141 --> 02:57:02.610]  To turn them into obedient slaves that will ultimately turn against you when the time comes, when the government says go.
[02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:04.212]  I have seen it.
[02:57:05.774 --> 02:57:21.401]  I have seen what it looks like when people who trust the government, because they've been squashed for so many years and turned into little obedient slaves that don't have the right to speak freely, that don't have the right to defend themselves.
[02:57:21.562 --> 02:57:26.104]  I have seen what it looks like when the government says, turn on your neighbour and they go.
[02:57:26.124 --> 02:57:28.465]  They don't hesitate for a moment.
[02:57:30.447 --> 02:57:33.288]  And this is exactly what they are turning America into now.
[02:57:33.468 --> 02:57:35.469]  As we speak, they are attempting this.
[02:57:37.970 --> 02:57:42.772]  And I know a lot of people that say it'll never work on me, but it'll work on 50 others.
[02:57:43.473 --> 02:57:55.678]  For every person that says, no, they'll never be able to control my mind this way, they are doing it and they're doing it at record speeds to people who don't want to be labelled as criminals.
[02:57:57.537 --> 02:58:01.220]  So I'm going to take you through some footage today, footage that you've probably already seen.
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:12.507]  But I'm going to do it from a perspective of someone who's already come from a country where they have successfully silenced so many, so many are afraid to speak.
[02:58:12.547 --> 02:58:14.649]  And I'm not in any way, stretch or form.
[02:58:15.049 --> 02:58:18.310]  We're here saying that Australians are not courageous people because they are.
[02:58:18.590 --> 02:58:21.871]  Believe you me, they're standing up against some serious tyranny.
[02:58:21.931 --> 02:58:29.113]  Right now they just passed a law in the state of Queensland that you can go to prison for up to three years if you offend a minority.
[02:58:29.353 --> 02:58:31.254]  This is how far Australia has gone.
[02:58:31.274 --> 02:58:34.015]  It's what they want to do here.
[02:58:35.049 --> 02:58:35.489]  Canada.
[02:58:35.809 --> 02:58:36.910]  Canada is the same thing.
[02:58:36.970 --> 02:58:45.692]  If you hurt some crazy leftist's feelings who believes these maniacs, you can go to prison because their feelings are hurt.
[02:58:47.973 --> 02:58:52.515]  And they want to turn America into this nightmare, so we cannot let them.
[02:58:53.835 --> 02:58:57.476]  And I've come from the other side of the world to warn you, America.
[02:58:57.976 --> 02:59:02.138]  And if you're watching this on X or Band.Video or InfoWars.com, share this now.
[02:59:03.240 --> 02:59:04.942]  Because Americans need to hear this.
[02:59:05.283 --> 02:59:06.845]  This isn't me preaching at you.
[02:59:07.045 --> 02:59:08.146]  This is me warning you.
[02:59:08.166 --> 02:59:10.369]  I know what it looks like.
[02:59:11.471 --> 02:59:19.782]  So I'm going to take you through some of this footage today from the perspective of someone who comes from a country where people are going to jail for offending people.
[02:59:21.974 --> 02:59:34.125]  And I'm not talking about an isolated example of someone posting a meme about Hillary Clinton that she somehow convolutes and deems election interference because they've found a way to circumvent your First Amendment.
[02:59:37.108 --> 02:59:38.709]  And you think they're not going to find other ways?
[02:59:38.749 --> 02:59:39.290]  They are.
[02:59:40.071 --> 02:59:45.516]  And they're showing you all the ways that they're going to find if they get power in this country.
[02:59:47.366 --> 02:59:58.563]  Team, please bring up the clip of Hillary Clinton talking about journalists needing to continue and amplify the messages that are currently resulting in assassination attempts against Trump.
[02:59:58.884 --> 03:00:00.566]  Hillary Clinton about journalists, please.
[03:00:01.685 --> 03:00:10.095]  You know, journalists should, you know, really try to achieve objectivity, and by that he said, I mean, they should cover the object.
[03:00:10.295 --> 03:00:20.466]  Well, the object in this case is Donald Trump, his demagoguery, his danger to our country and the world, and stick with it.
[03:00:21.127 --> 03:00:34.446]  You know, they were merciless about what they saw as President Biden's, you know, problems in the debate and calling for him to... Stick with it, she says.
[03:00:34.546 --> 03:00:35.247]  Stick with it.
[03:00:36.567 --> 03:00:44.931]  Now let me tell you that the demoralisation of the people in this nation has already succeeded in some regard, or at least the brainwashing in some regard.
[03:00:45.192 --> 03:00:55.697]  And I'm not talking about the conservatives here, I'm talking about, you can call them leftists, you can call them the people who trust the government, socialists, communists, whatever you want, I'm talking about the people that don't see a problem with this.
[03:00:56.198 --> 03:01:01.120]  There are too many of them, because Hillary Clinton is still able to say those things.
[03:01:02.781 --> 03:01:04.262]  And still give an airtime.
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:12.008]  Can we please bring up the Trump posting on Truth Social, I think I've named the file, Trump tweet.
[03:01:12.048 --> 03:01:16.835]  I want to look at this tweet, or this posting on Truth Social, from Donald Trump.
[03:01:18.424 --> 03:01:20.885]  Where he attributes the blame to these people.
[03:01:20.925 --> 03:01:44.230]  He says the rhetoric lies as exemplified by the false statements made by comrade Kamala Harris during the rigged and highly partisan ABC debate and all of the ridiculous lawsuits specifically designed to inflict damage on Joe's then Kamala's political opponent, me, has taken politics in our country to a whole new level of hatred, abuse and distrust because of this communist left rhetoric.
[03:01:44.850 --> 03:01:48.992]  The bullets are flying and it will only get worse.
[03:01:49.572 --> 03:01:56.155]  He goes on to speak about the problem with allowing all of these people into the country, invading the country.
[03:01:56.455 --> 03:02:06.400]  What he's talking about here is the impact of the psychology, the weaponised psychology on the people that think that the government has their best interests at heart.
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:07.140]  Think about this.
[03:02:09.235 --> 03:02:17.358]  And then people, thank you team, we can take that down, and people will say, oh well what about Donald Trump talking about these leftists, these lunatics, it's all true!
[03:02:17.378 --> 03:02:29.803]  And the problem is that the people, not the problem, the positive thing, is that the people who believe Donald Trump and know this to be true and know that Kamala is a communist and that she wants to ruin your life,
[03:02:30.933 --> 03:02:33.834]  They're not going out and committing political violence.
[03:02:34.114 --> 03:02:34.614]  They're not.
[03:02:35.334 --> 03:02:37.114]  They just want to do things the right way.
[03:02:37.154 --> 03:02:38.235]  They want to see justice.
[03:02:38.275 --> 03:02:39.995]  They want to see things done the right way.
[03:02:40.035 --> 03:02:52.518]  Meanwhile, you have Democrats literally mocking Donald Trump and mocking the assassination attempts and sometimes even denying that they occurred and sometimes even calling for more.
[03:02:53.953 --> 03:02:58.256]  There's a difference in the response of the people because they have not been damaged.
[03:02:58.496 --> 03:03:01.839]  Conservatives have not been damaged by the psychology of the left.
[03:03:01.899 --> 03:03:07.603]  So when Donald Trump says Kamala is a leftist lunatic, no conservative thinks, gee, I want to cause her harm.
[03:03:08.083 --> 03:03:09.504]  They think we just want her out of office.
[03:03:09.544 --> 03:03:11.225]  We want her to stop destroying the country.
[03:03:11.265 --> 03:03:12.766]  Please, someone do something about this.
[03:03:13.007 --> 03:03:13.967]  Let's do it honestly.
[03:03:14.187 --> 03:03:15.288]  Let's do it with integrity.
[03:03:15.328 --> 03:03:17.430]  Let's rally up as many people as possible to vote.
[03:03:17.690 --> 03:03:20.292]  Whereas the leftists go, gee, maybe I should go and
[03:03:20.832 --> 03:03:25.017]  Really do something about this threat to our democracy and that is exactly what happened.
[03:03:26.359 --> 03:03:32.546]  I'm not going to get into all of the details about all of the things that don't make sense about the second shooter and even the first today.
[03:03:33.547 --> 03:03:37.832]  I'm talking about the fact that their psychology inspires sin.
[03:03:40.086 --> 03:03:42.848]  Their psychology inspires degeneracy.
[03:03:43.268 --> 03:03:52.073]  Their psychology inspires things like grown men dancing with their genitals out in children's faces and no one doing a thing about it.
[03:03:52.093 --> 03:03:56.216]  20 years ago, what would have happened if we saw that on our streets?
[03:03:57.984 --> 03:03:58.704]  What would have happened?
[03:03:58.724 --> 03:04:08.727]  You would have had, I don't know, a sheriff, the entire FBI, every single person from every neighboring city surrounding this saying, get this pedophile away from my children.
[03:04:08.767 --> 03:04:13.609]  But today, today, no, no, no, we'll get men with fake breasts.
[03:04:14.744 --> 03:04:20.807]  To parade around in front of the White House and further demoralise the people that think that we're doing something great for the nation.
[03:04:21.587 --> 03:04:23.948]  And then we're going to call for political violence and guess what?
[03:04:23.988 --> 03:04:28.410]  Those brainwashed, mentally damaged people are going to go out and do it.
[03:04:29.631 --> 03:04:30.972]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[03:04:34.493 --> 03:04:35.994]  So what is the response to this?
[03:04:36.054 --> 03:04:39.716]  What is the response to the fact that these people have gone so out of control?
[03:04:40.891 --> 03:04:44.213]  And instead of toning down their rhetoric, they're doubling down on Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:44.233 --> 03:04:47.996]  We need to criminally charge Trump supporters, essentially.
[03:04:48.036 --> 03:04:49.157]  Let's play that clip.
[03:04:53.661 --> 03:04:55.643]  ...boosting Trump back in 2016.
[03:04:56.103 --> 03:05:02.828]  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[03:05:03.828 --> 03:05:12.355]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[03:05:13.345 --> 03:05:19.668]  So you need to be criminally charged, maybe civilly or criminally charged if you're a Trump supporter is essentially what that woman is saying.
[03:05:20.028 --> 03:05:24.210]  More so, you need to be civilly or criminally charged if you don't agree with me.
[03:05:25.571 --> 03:05:28.312]  Why is this woman still getting airtime?
[03:05:30.498 --> 03:05:37.303]  Why is it that every single mainstream media outlet still brings these women out to say these things?
[03:05:37.884 --> 03:05:52.295]  Because the damaged, the mentally damaged people that trust the government, that are already way, way down the line of, you know, the point of no return, think, okay, this is a woman.
[03:05:52.395 --> 03:05:53.376]  We can trust a woman.
[03:05:53.676 --> 03:05:54.496]  Believe all women.
[03:05:55.537 --> 03:05:56.358]  Believe all women.
[03:05:58.482 --> 03:06:02.524]  Meanwhile, they tell you to stop having children and sterilize yourself.
[03:06:04.025 --> 03:06:07.006]  Believe that men are your enemy, segwaying from the last segment.
[03:06:07.386 --> 03:06:08.106]  Men are your enemy.
[03:06:09.087 --> 03:06:10.688]  Go and work yourself to the bone.
[03:06:10.788 --> 03:06:13.709]  Be childless forever and then be just like Hillary Clinton.
[03:06:13.749 --> 03:06:14.869]  We've got your back.
[03:06:16.170 --> 03:06:22.453]  So they put this woman out to plant the seeds that your disagreement with the government means that you are a criminal.
[03:06:25.555 --> 03:06:33.777]  This is something that will eventually... These are the ways in which they are circumventing the First Amendment.
[03:06:34.597 --> 03:06:41.279]  The ways in which they're slowly, slowly chipping away at it, although now it's not even slowly anymore, it's a daily occurrence.
[03:06:41.759 --> 03:06:45.820]  So yes, you have your First Amendment, but these people are coming for it.
[03:06:48.440 --> 03:06:50.981]  The whole world looks to the United States
[03:06:51.963 --> 03:06:53.024]  As a symbol of freedom.
[03:06:53.084 --> 03:06:55.226]  Still, to this day, I want to make that clear.
[03:06:55.946 --> 03:06:58.028]  I want to make that clear to Americans.
[03:06:58.548 --> 03:07:07.335]  Every single country in the West is praying that things turn around in the US because we know that this is the last stand.
[03:07:08.956 --> 03:07:19.785]  Your Constitution, your Bill of Rights is something unique and something that must be understood and exercised at every opportunity and you must never, ever let these people trample on it.
[03:07:19.825 --> 03:07:20.766]  But they're trying.
[03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:23.490]  And there are people who believe them.
[03:07:24.491 --> 03:07:27.532]  And these people will wage war against you in the courts.
[03:07:27.573 --> 03:07:30.534]  They'll wage war against you in the social media spaces.
[03:07:30.815 --> 03:07:34.997]  They'll go and lobby harder than you ever will because they're mentally damaged.
[03:07:36.158 --> 03:07:40.801]  So we have to ramp up our efforts to protect what is good and right.
[03:07:44.723 --> 03:07:48.345]  You have Al Sharpton ramping up the rhetoric.
[03:07:49.106 --> 03:07:50.707]  Trump is a threat to black people.
[03:07:55.433 --> 03:07:55.994]  Do you see?
[03:07:56.134 --> 03:07:57.495]  They've all answered the call.
[03:07:58.436 --> 03:08:07.146]  At the complete opposite that they should be doing, which is to stop this, to tone it down, to stop putting people into a frenzy.
[03:08:07.206 --> 03:08:13.032]  No, they are mobilising their mentally ill soldiers as we speak.
[03:08:13.112 --> 03:08:15.735]  Team, if we can play that clip of Al Sharpton, please.
[03:08:16.816 --> 03:08:25.898]  And when you look at the fact that he is now admitting they made up a story, as you say, quoting him, that the media wouldn't cover.
[03:08:25.958 --> 03:08:29.238]  Maybe the media didn't cover it because there was no story.
[03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:30.339]  It didn't exist.
[03:08:31.059 --> 03:08:35.380]  But again, this is consistent with Trump's campaign.
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:41.921]  Let's not forget Donald Trump as president called Haiti and several African countries asshole countries.
[03:08:42.481 --> 03:08:57.280]  You also have to factor in that if you are someone that is anti-Haitians in Springfield, or coming in to think you're defending the people of Springfield whose pets are being eaten up,
[03:08:58.081 --> 03:09:02.325]  Any black walking around Springfield looks Haitian.
[03:09:02.445 --> 03:09:03.886]  I mean, it is racist.
[03:09:04.526 --> 03:09:06.288]  It is a clear threat to people.
[03:09:06.828 --> 03:09:21.240]  And just like I denounce whoever's trying to assassinate Donald Trump for whatever reasons, they should denounce the fact that they are inciting nuts to feel that they can go into Springfield and save pets.
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:38.014]  Those nuts Al Sharpton, those nuts that you say that they're inciting was proven by the Governor Mike DeWine confirmed that all 30 anti-Haitian bomb threats were a hoax and most came from overseas.
[03:09:38.054 --> 03:09:39.796]  We have the video but I'll just show you.
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:43.902]  Mike DeWine confirmed that they were all a hoax.
[03:09:43.922 --> 03:09:47.564]  They all came from overseas and yet you're still there spewing that because why?
[03:09:47.604 --> 03:09:50.827]  Because you want to confirm that black people are victims.
[03:09:51.187 --> 03:09:57.531]  Black people are the victims here because the Haitians are... I guess that's a good thing now.
[03:09:57.571 --> 03:10:06.658]  Let's say next that anyone that has a problem with Haitians eating animals and sacrificing them in voodoo rituals, which is the main religion over there.
[03:10:07.912 --> 03:10:09.293]  That's racist!
[03:10:09.333 --> 03:10:11.034]  How dare you be a racist!
[03:10:11.314 --> 03:10:12.375]  And do you know what happens?
[03:10:12.896 --> 03:10:13.656]  This is what happens.
[03:10:13.676 --> 03:10:15.618]  Let me explain this psychology.
[03:10:15.678 --> 03:10:19.901]  People say, I don't want to be considered a racist.
[03:10:21.242 --> 03:10:22.783]  I don't want to be labelled a racist.
[03:10:22.823 --> 03:10:26.325]  I don't want to be contributing to inflamed rhetoric.
[03:10:26.405 --> 03:10:27.186]  I don't want to do that.
[03:10:27.226 --> 03:10:28.427]  We need to calm this down.
[03:10:28.507 --> 03:10:33.611]  Meanwhile, they continue to do it by telling you that you're being a good person if you don't.
[03:10:35.487 --> 03:10:43.992]  There is nothing racist about talking about a problem with a particular group.
[03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:48.235]  And even if it is, so what?
[03:10:48.895 --> 03:10:49.836]  There is a problem.
[03:10:50.096 --> 03:10:51.597]  These people are eating animals.
[03:10:51.857 --> 03:10:56.160]  They do perform satanic voodoo rituals with these animals.
[03:10:56.460 --> 03:10:59.242]  It's kind of not conducive with American society.
[03:10:59.522 --> 03:11:01.143]  Maybe we need to think about that.
[03:11:02.684 --> 03:11:04.005]  What are we going to do about this?
[03:11:05.404 --> 03:11:07.085]  Those discussions need to be had.
[03:11:07.505 --> 03:11:14.889]  But no, no, no, they bring out the token guy that says this is racist towards black people, towards my community.
[03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:27.816]  And then your weaker people, the people that maybe understand that there's a Bill of Rights, they understand that there's a problem here, but they're too weak and uninformed to speak up or fight back.
[03:11:28.637 --> 03:11:30.498]  They said, well, I don't want to be considered a racist.
[03:11:31.357 --> 03:11:31.937]  I don't want to be.
[03:11:32.498 --> 03:11:38.400]  And I'm telling you this from a country that is very politically correct, full of really good people that don't want to do the wrong thing.
[03:11:39.961 --> 03:11:43.122]  These are the tactics that are being deployed right now as we speak.
[03:11:47.704 --> 03:11:54.947]  I want to go to the clip of the Australian Prime Minister calling this an incident.
[03:11:55.868 --> 03:11:57.588]  Albanese incident.
[03:11:57.768 --> 03:11:59.049]  If we can play that clip, please.
[03:12:02.938 --> 03:12:07.336]  Everyone wants the democratic process to be peaceful.
[03:12:08.599 --> 03:12:14.560]  And to be orderly, this incident in the United States is of concern again.
[03:12:14.580 --> 03:12:33.185]  It is good that President Trump has said that he is safe and that the incident, the details of which are still coming out, so it's not quite clear, all of those details, but what is clear is that President Trump is safe.
[03:12:33.585 --> 03:12:34.745]  That is a good thing.
[03:12:36.089 --> 03:12:55.137]  This weak, weak little man, tiny, tiny, small little man, that has been given the responsibility to run Australia, just called this an incident three times, long after the authorities had confirmed that this was an assassination attempt.
[03:12:57.078 --> 03:13:00.820]  Long after, he says, we just still don't know all the details, so that's his cover.
[03:13:02.887 --> 03:13:10.049]  Because he doesn't want to amplify the fact that political violence is occurring in the United States.
[03:13:12.810 --> 03:13:13.330]  Pardon me.
[03:13:16.531 --> 03:13:19.911]  Team, can we go to the video of the Ohio governor, please?
[03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:25.153]  Leased 33 separate bomb threats.
[03:13:30.569 --> 03:13:35.593]  Each one of which has been responded to.
[03:13:36.764 --> 03:13:42.426]  And each one of whom has been found as a hoax.
[03:13:42.706 --> 03:13:46.067]  So 33 threats, 33 hoax.
[03:13:46.848 --> 03:13:48.428]  And we'll make that very, very clear.
[03:13:48.668 --> 03:13:52.110]  None of these had any validity at all.
[03:13:53.270 --> 03:13:56.751]  We know that people are very, very concerned.
[03:13:57.252 --> 03:14:00.553]  All right, so you have the authorities confirming
[03:14:01.892 --> 03:14:09.660]  That this was an assassination attempt on Trump, the leader of Australia, apparently an ally of the United States.
[03:14:11.201 --> 03:14:18.368]  And I'm not trying to cause a rift between the two countries, because believe you me, where the people of the countries are concerned, we are definitely aligned.
[03:14:18.428 --> 03:14:23.153]  And obviously, the Australian government is aligned with Kamala and lunatics like her.
[03:14:25.026 --> 03:14:31.813]  But you have him saying this is an incident three separate times after authorities have confirmed.
[03:14:31.833 --> 03:14:43.184]  The official report comes out, you have the Ohio governor coming out and confirming all of these 30 bomb threats were from overseas and you still have the mainstream media saying
[03:14:43.404 --> 03:14:45.445]  Trump is causing all these bomb threats.
[03:14:45.505 --> 03:14:46.825]  They keep going!
[03:14:47.186 --> 03:15:04.933]  They keep going because they don't care how many lies they tell, because they're banking on you and all of the people that listen to them being completely uninformed, and they're banking on the fact that through this constant lying, this constant psychological tactic, they will be able to demoralise you.
[03:15:05.193 --> 03:15:09.875]  They will be able to wear you down because you're spending all of your time countering their lies.
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:12.584]  We have to reverse this, everyone.
[03:15:12.864 --> 03:15:13.787]  We have to reverse this.
[03:15:13.827 --> 03:15:14.369]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:14.409 --> 03:15:16.093]  We'll be back after this short break.
[03:15:16.661 --> 03:15:27.624]  We certainly don't claim to be doctors, but InfoWarsMD can prescribe a wide variety of supplement formulas to help you stay healthy in an ever-growing toxic world.

[03:16:16.811 --> 03:16:19.152]  It's not just a Democrat machine.
[03:16:19.653 --> 03:16:21.434]  It is a satanic machine.
[03:16:22.535 --> 03:16:24.696]  This is real evil that we are dealing with.
[03:16:25.917 --> 03:16:28.478]  Real, serious evil.
[03:16:29.139 --> 03:16:31.961]  I'm not saying that to be bombastic.
[03:16:33.462 --> 03:16:43.290]  I don't want to over say it because when people say it's a spiritual war we hear that so much and often when we say things over and over they kind of get tired.
[03:16:45.111 --> 03:16:47.854]  But the truth should never get tired because these maniacs...
[03:16:49.022 --> 03:16:58.146]  These maniacs that are doing this to us, they don't get tired of repeating the same lies that brainwash their base all the time.
[03:16:58.466 --> 03:17:01.947]  Threat to democracy, threat to democracy, threat to democracy.
[03:17:02.007 --> 03:17:05.689]  How many times have you heard threat to democracy?
[03:17:08.010 --> 03:17:09.911]  So we shouldn't get tired of the truth either.
[03:17:11.011 --> 03:17:17.314]  We should have it burned into our brains that this is a spiritual war and those who are waging
[03:17:18.698 --> 03:17:19.999]  Evil against good.
[03:17:23.660 --> 03:17:25.121]  Well, I don't even know what to say about them.
[03:17:26.661 --> 03:17:29.002]  They are demonically influenced.
[03:17:30.002 --> 03:17:30.743]  We need to pray.
[03:17:31.963 --> 03:17:32.744]  We need to repent.
[03:17:35.144 --> 03:17:41.307]  I want to play... Actually, I want to show you all a tweet.
[03:17:42.662 --> 03:17:46.803]  A tweet from Rachel Vindman in response.
[03:17:46.863 --> 03:17:50.445]  Now, she's since apologized because of the immense backlash that she got.
[03:17:50.485 --> 03:17:52.185]  And of course, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:17:52.565 --> 03:17:53.525]  called her out as well.
[03:17:53.966 --> 03:18:08.990]  But Rachel Vindman posting about, there we go, if we can zoom into the actual tweet from Rachel Vindman team, if you can, where she says, no ears were harmed, carry on with your Sunday afternoon.
[03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:10.211]  And guess who's following her?
[03:18:11.186 --> 03:18:11.787]  It's really interesting.
[03:18:11.827 --> 03:18:13.989]  I wonder whether she agrees with her ideology.
[03:18:14.069 --> 03:18:16.191]  That woman there is Julianne McGrant.
[03:18:17.292 --> 03:18:28.404]  She is the person that's waging warfare against Elon Musk, that wants to censor the entirety of speech across borders, not just in Australia, but across borders.
[03:18:28.444 --> 03:18:31.227]  She's done work with the White House on, I don't know, gay stuff.
[03:18:32.347 --> 03:18:39.751]  And she wants to censor your speech in America if you dare talk about any Australian issues.
[03:18:39.791 --> 03:18:48.115]  She's recently paired up with the disgraced former Ministry of Head Truth Nina Jankowicz, if you all remember that crazy lady.
[03:18:48.835 --> 03:18:54.939]  After the backlash all over the internet about that ministry of truth that Biden tried to start up.
[03:18:55.359 --> 03:19:05.286]  And her video that clearly a lot of people perceived as her being mentally ill and completely unfit to be in any sort of position of determining what is truth and what isn't.
[03:19:06.386 --> 03:19:09.428]  And Julie Inman Grant is following Rachel Vindman now.
[03:19:09.488 --> 03:19:12.871]  Maybe she's just keeping an eye on her, but maybe she agrees with her ideology.
[03:19:12.911 --> 03:19:17.794]  We certainly know that Julie Inman Grant has been very critical of Trump in the past.
[03:19:20.305 --> 03:19:22.466]  And you see how these people flock together.
[03:19:23.346 --> 03:19:29.929]  You see how these people that want to continue this demoralization of society flock together.
[03:19:29.969 --> 03:19:45.495]  The interesting thing, and this is what I said at the start, is that the demoralization is happening everywhere, the attack is happening everywhere, but some places are further along to being destroyed by leftist ideology than others.
[03:19:47.596 --> 03:19:48.597]  It gets to the point
[03:19:49.571 --> 03:19:54.136]  When they bring in these laws, I can just give you an example of what's happening in Australia.
[03:19:54.937 --> 03:20:07.951]  These mis and disinformation laws of who that woman, Julie Inman Grant, who maybe, maybe doesn't like Rachel Winman, I don't know, but she follows her and really dislikes Trump.
[03:20:09.537 --> 03:20:19.971]  People like her support these laws and right now they're having discussions about a missing disinformation bill in Australia which would see people potentially imprisoned for their views.
[03:20:21.075 --> 03:20:26.817]  And that law that I told you about that's passed in Queensland means that social media is essentially a public act.
[03:20:26.957 --> 03:20:33.599]  Posting on social media is a public act which can land you in prison for three years if you offend a minority.
[03:20:33.939 --> 03:20:35.079]  Define minority?
[03:20:35.599 --> 03:20:36.399]  Ah, I don't know.
[03:20:37.180 --> 03:20:37.800]  Trans.
[03:20:39.180 --> 03:20:41.001]  You know, different skin colour.
[03:20:41.861 --> 03:20:45.002]  Anyone that isn't white or Christian is a minority.
[03:20:45.962 --> 03:20:53.208]  Even though the amount of white Christians are slowly being picked off, and that is exactly where this leads.
[03:20:53.308 --> 03:21:06.639]  When they bring in these laws, and Hillary Clinton talks about, you know, we need to criminally charge Trump supporters, whether civilly or criminally, and they start putting these words out, and then they start picking off people one by one by one.
[03:21:06.700 --> 03:21:10.303]  You may say, I will never ever give up my First or Second Amendment rights.
[03:21:10.343 --> 03:21:11.403]  There's no chance.
[03:21:11.443 --> 03:21:11.984]  That's true.
[03:21:12.024 --> 03:21:12.464]  You won't.
[03:21:13.424 --> 03:21:15.246]  But that guy down there may.
[03:21:15.887 --> 03:21:17.408]  And that guy down there may.
[03:21:17.428 --> 03:21:18.109]  Because you know what?
[03:21:18.149 --> 03:21:19.751]  They may not even be evil people.
[03:21:19.791 --> 03:21:23.215]  They're just good people that don't really want to be classed as criminals.
[03:21:24.551 --> 03:21:31.458]  That's certainly what happened in Australia when they started, and already you have restrictive gun laws in some states here in the US.
[03:21:32.318 --> 03:21:47.232]  In Australia, when they said, okay, we're taking all the guns back, I know someone personally, very, very good, upstanding citizen involved in many community groups, had absolutely no reason to think that he was a criminal for having this gun, might go hunting now and again.
[03:21:47.853 --> 03:22:10.456]  Protect his family if, God forbid, an invader comes into his home, but he willingly went and gave that gun back because, God forbid, having the title of criminal associated with you, having that possibility of the government considering you a criminal, you will be very, very surprised how many good people that would never, ever break the law
[03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:20.394]  And respect and value, I should say, value their rights will still go and do the right thing.
[03:22:21.448 --> 03:22:45.885]  Because they don't want to put their families in jeopardy and then what happens is as society continues to destruct further and further and descend further and further and it becomes more difficult to afford to provide for your family and there's more restrictions on work because I guess AI is now deciding whether you're fit for a job or not based on your social media activity or maybe how much meat you bought this month or how far you traveled this month.
[03:22:46.525 --> 03:22:56.752]  At first it may not be AI, it'll be a government automated system or it'll be some call center operative that's going through your application.
[03:22:57.512 --> 03:23:04.737]  Someone maybe in the Philippines that they've hired to go through your application to see if you're really a suitable candidate.
[03:23:05.882 --> 03:23:12.946]  But then all of a sudden your job opportunities get narrower and narrower and then you add digital ID into the mix, which monitors everything you do online.
[03:23:12.966 --> 03:23:15.488]  Of course, you can't have a bank account without digital ID.
[03:23:16.108 --> 03:23:22.812]  So then you're forced to comply because there's no other way to feed your family.
[03:23:22.832 --> 03:23:26.774]  I often say to people, if you resisted the injections, you did very well.
[03:23:27.795 --> 03:23:34.759]  But when digital ID comes in, and believe you me, Biden is wanting, or whoever,
[03:23:35.731 --> 03:23:39.553]  In the Biden administration is wanting this in before the election.
[03:23:39.573 --> 03:23:41.874]  He's working on it as we speak.
[03:23:42.594 --> 03:23:43.795]  Not Biden, he's on a beach.
[03:23:44.335 --> 03:23:46.196]  Someone else is working on it as we speak.
[03:23:48.457 --> 03:23:51.899]  Once that's embedded into society, well, then it's game over.
[03:23:52.279 --> 03:24:01.784]  But what they're gonna do in the meantime is crush you and crush you and crush you until you don't even have the ability to speak out against these things.
[03:24:03.985 --> 03:24:10.788]  The misinformation bill in Australia literally says, I'm not even kidding, and I've just interviewed a senator about it.
[03:24:11.188 --> 03:24:12.229]  I'll have that out this week.
[03:24:12.869 --> 03:24:22.033]  It literally says that if you choose to, and this is what these people mean when they talk about criminalizing misinformation.
[03:24:22.233 --> 03:24:26.095]  I want to be clear about what Hillary Clinton and the leftists are actually talking about.
[03:24:26.435 --> 03:24:32.518]  You'll recall that clip of Tim Walz saying, you know, the First Amendment, you know, it does have some limits.
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:34.620]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:24:37.022 --> 03:24:39.723]  If you guys have that clip, team, let me know.
[03:24:39.863 --> 03:24:44.086]  Just let me know in my ear if you have that clip of Tim Walz talking about the First Amendment having some limits.
[03:24:45.306 --> 03:24:46.787]  And what they, you have it.
[03:24:46.867 --> 03:24:47.647]  Wow, they're so quick.
[03:24:48.308 --> 03:24:49.188]  Oh, they're working on it.
[03:24:49.248 --> 03:24:49.549]  All right.
[03:24:51.510 --> 03:24:58.233]  What they mean when they talk about misinformation, I can tell you from the Australian Mis and Disinformation Bill what they mean.
[03:24:58.293 --> 03:25:02.816]  They mean criticizing the economy or the banking system
[03:25:04.622 --> 03:25:10.065]  Making people lose public confidence in the government and its functions.
[03:25:11.945 --> 03:25:17.548]  Health, anything that would undermine the government's efforts to ensure everyone's very healthy.
[03:25:18.728 --> 03:25:22.030]  When a flight attendant just dropped dead on an aeroplane again.
[03:25:24.611 --> 03:25:27.352]  These are the types of things that they consider misinformation.
[03:25:27.372 --> 03:25:31.934]  So in other words, anything that threatens their regime.
[03:25:32.932 --> 03:25:38.254]  And you think a communist like Kamala Harris wouldn't be bringing things like this in?
[03:25:38.294 --> 03:25:49.138]  You think that someone like Hillary Clinton wouldn't be ensuring that this ideology doesn't just go through the mainstream media, it goes through the entirety of the machine?
[03:25:49.178 --> 03:25:56.621]  What happens when the balance of power in the Supreme Court shifts if these people are in power?
[03:25:59.202 --> 03:26:00.503]  Let's play that clip of Tim Walz.
[03:26:00.543 --> 03:26:01.023]  Thank you, Tim.
[03:26:02.922 --> 03:26:04.365]  I think we need to push back on this.
[03:26:04.425 --> 03:26:10.197]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech and especially around our democracy.
[03:26:11.981 --> 03:26:12.502]  Do you see?
[03:26:13.936 --> 03:26:19.939]  There's no guarantee to free speech when it comes to mis- and disinformation.
[03:26:20.339 --> 03:26:25.442]  And those words are code for anything that threatens their regime.
[03:26:25.482 --> 03:26:26.703]  And what is their regime?
[03:26:27.323 --> 03:26:38.889]  To squash you, to put you under the control of the UN's goals, to put you under a one-world government, to link your digital ID to your one-world currency, to eventually
[03:26:40.592 --> 03:26:42.553]  Force you to take the mark of the beast.
[03:26:42.753 --> 03:26:46.134]  I am telling you, this is 100% their endgame.
[03:26:46.435 --> 03:26:49.976]  Whether this guy knows it or not, this is the endgame.
[03:26:51.317 --> 03:26:52.717]  Can't buy or sell without the mark.
[03:26:53.058 --> 03:27:01.862]  And you look, we have never been in a time clearer than this in society, where this system is staring us in the face.
[03:27:03.862 --> 03:27:09.225]  And it doesn't have to be now, and it doesn't have to be this way, but we have to understand where it's heading.
[03:27:11.226 --> 03:27:12.907]  We have to understand where it's heading.
[03:27:13.287 --> 03:27:19.108]  Australia is letting politicians get away with the most egregious things.
[03:27:19.168 --> 03:27:20.369]  I've told this story before.
[03:27:21.649 --> 03:27:25.170]  But there were parents protesting drag queen pedophile time.
[03:27:25.270 --> 03:27:27.051]  They didn't want it in their libraries.
[03:27:28.385 --> 03:27:34.790]  And because there weren't enough of them, because not enough people were outraged enough.
[03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:43.818]  Again, I tell you, go back 20 years and think about some of the stuff that happens at these pride parades, which I think are abhorrent, and most people here would.
[03:27:45.848 --> 03:27:48.570]  Think about 20 years ago, whether they would have gotten away with this.
[03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:50.051]  Why do they get away with it now?
[03:27:50.091 --> 03:27:52.553]  There's more of us today than there was 20 years ago.
[03:27:52.834 --> 03:27:54.215]  The population's bigger, isn't it?
[03:27:54.535 --> 03:27:58.058]  Unless more people have died from the shots than they tell us, which is also a possibility.
[03:27:58.278 --> 03:27:59.879]  But nonetheless, you see my point.
[03:28:01.440 --> 03:28:02.461]  There's more people now.
[03:28:02.761 --> 03:28:06.825]  We have more ability to organise against these things now than we ever have.
[03:28:07.265 --> 03:28:09.827]  And they're peeing on each other!
[03:28:09.847 --> 03:28:11.949]  In public!
[03:28:15.885 --> 03:28:18.427]  Would that have been able to go ahead 20 years ago?
[03:28:18.787 --> 03:28:23.990]  So in Australia, a few parents organised, and God bless them, but nowhere near enough.
[03:28:25.231 --> 03:28:31.796]  Nonetheless, because there wasn't enough public outrage about this, the government said, the drag queens don't feel safe.
[03:28:32.736 --> 03:28:37.259]  So they took them into Parliament building with the children, locked the door.
[03:28:38.220 --> 03:28:39.461]  No one knows what happened in there.
[03:28:41.431 --> 03:28:44.513]  What did these drag queens actually do with these kids?
[03:28:44.633 --> 03:28:45.033]  I don't know.
[03:28:45.714 --> 03:28:47.234]  But my tax dollars paid for it.
[03:28:47.435 --> 03:28:54.619]  And speaking of my tax dollars, the US ambassador, the Australian US ambassador, Kevin Rudd.
[03:28:55.619 --> 03:29:00.082]  Team, if you can bring up Kevin Rudd's tweet about Donald Trump some time ago.
[03:29:00.162 --> 03:29:02.323]  These are the things that he said about Donald Trump.
[03:29:02.544 --> 03:29:09.688]  This is the US ambassador, the Australian US ambassador, saying Donald Trump is a traitor to the West.
[03:29:10.905 --> 03:29:16.626]  Murdoch was Trump's biggest backer and Murdoch's Fox television backs Putin too.
[03:29:17.126 --> 03:29:19.207]  What rancid treachery.
[03:29:19.227 --> 03:29:22.468]  A traitor to the West he's calling Trump.
[03:29:23.128 --> 03:29:28.129]  This is the Australian US ambassador and do you know what he's doing here at the moment?
[03:29:29.049 --> 03:29:32.530]  I've got two posts to show you, Kevin Rudd one and two.
[03:29:33.814 --> 03:29:44.899]  It's currently spending Australian tax dollars to hold drag queen parties, including paying for drag queen DJs, catering and balloons.
[03:29:46.087 --> 03:29:47.629]  In the United States!
[03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:53.355]  The second drag queen party that he held was, I believe, to the tune of $70,000.
[03:29:53.435 --> 03:30:06.509]  He's here holding some, I don't know, living out some sort of weird sexual fantasy, I guess, in the United States, talking about how Trump is a traitor to the West.
[03:30:07.472 --> 03:30:08.272]  What are you doing?
[03:30:08.292 --> 03:30:20.139]  You are the Australian US ambassador and you're spending all this time having parties with drag queens, potentially living out your sexual fetishes, and you're the one to criticize Trump?
[03:30:22.280 --> 03:30:32.546]  I really hope, I really, really hope I'm sending a strong message today about how degenerate it will get
[03:30:34.514 --> 03:30:48.714]  Where you've got to the point where a country that has had drag queen pedophile time in its parliament with locked doors with children inside is sending their ambassador to do this in the US.
[03:30:54.372 --> 03:30:58.776]  Again, I'm not trying to disparage the relations between these two nations.
[03:30:59.136 --> 03:31:01.178]  I absolutely love America.
[03:31:01.378 --> 03:31:02.179]  I love Australia.
[03:31:02.579 --> 03:31:07.824]  I want the people in both nations to know that we are all standing together against this nonsense.
[03:31:08.124 --> 03:31:17.292]  But these leaders that want to talk about Trump being a traitor to not just America, the whole West, he's a traitor to the whole West.
[03:31:17.592 --> 03:31:20.735]  But here I am in your country doing drag queen
[03:31:23.120 --> 03:31:29.146]  Performing my, I guess, maybe my sexual fantasies with drag queens on Australian tax dollars dimes.
[03:31:29.926 --> 03:31:31.228]  That's what this guy's doing.
[03:31:32.509 --> 03:31:33.770]  These people are not leaders.
[03:31:34.591 --> 03:31:39.395]  Anthony Albanese three times repeating that this was an incident.
[03:31:40.575 --> 03:31:44.918]  After authorities had officially confirmed this was an assassination attempt.
[03:31:45.198 --> 03:31:46.418]  These people are not leaders.
[03:31:46.679 --> 03:31:48.259]  Tim Walls is not a leader.
[03:31:48.319 --> 03:31:49.580]  Kamala is not a leader.
[03:31:49.620 --> 03:32:02.027]  These are dog kings that have been installed to demoralise us further until we get to the point where it doesn't have to be pedophile time behind closed doors in Parliament.
[03:32:02.247 --> 03:32:03.368]  It'll be out on the street.
[03:32:03.428 --> 03:32:04.509]  Heck, we're almost there!
[03:32:05.950 --> 03:32:11.054]  They pee on each other in front of children in the streets in Canada during the pride parade.
[03:32:11.074 --> 03:32:13.135]  I think that was, no, that was here.
[03:32:13.976 --> 03:32:14.456]  That was here.
[03:32:16.338 --> 03:32:20.361]  And then people in conservative areas think it's not going to come to us.
[03:32:21.221 --> 03:32:30.809]  Well, let me tell you, I spent some time in a very small town that is majority conservative in Texas.
[03:32:32.430 --> 03:32:34.952]  And not only is there a pride event coming up,
[03:32:35.879 --> 03:32:42.745]  But they want to bring in some external group to talk to 9 to 12 year olds about their sexuality.
[03:32:43.925 --> 03:32:45.947]  Because this is like a cancer.
[03:32:46.207 --> 03:32:47.308]  It's a cancer.
[03:32:47.769 --> 03:32:49.270]  And you can't stab it out.
[03:32:49.330 --> 03:32:53.893]  And what I mean is, you can't just stab the cancer out of the body.
[03:32:54.434 --> 03:32:57.316]  You can't just take little stabs at it.
[03:32:58.417 --> 03:33:00.379]  Cancer has to be removed from the root.
[03:33:01.820 --> 03:33:08.508]  And the way to remove it from the root is to not have this in society, to preserve what is good and right and righteous.
[03:33:13.814 --> 03:33:17.919]  To not allow these people to come and talk to your nine-year-olds about sex.
[03:33:20.622 --> 03:33:21.603]  To say no.
[03:33:22.734 --> 03:33:31.479]  We're not going to allow you to demoralise us and tell us that we're hateful and that we're racists because we're pointing out that people are eating cats and pedophiles want our children.
[03:33:31.859 --> 03:33:35.080]  We are not hateful, we are not racist, we are none of those things.
[03:33:35.341 --> 03:33:37.121]  We will not be politically correct.
[03:33:37.161 --> 03:33:45.606]  Do not let these people turn you into politically correct people that let themselves be trampled on by rubber bullets during a peaceful protest.
[03:33:45.986 --> 03:33:47.447]  I am referring to Australia.
[03:33:49.212 --> 03:34:02.864]  Because the political correctness that seeped through that nation, the fear of offending, the fear of saying what's wrong in the corporate workplace or whatever the case may be for so many years is how they did what they did during COVID.
[03:34:03.765 --> 03:34:10.791]  And it's how they did what they're doing now because they have such a large majority of the population that has been brainwashed.
[03:34:11.479 --> 03:34:13.920]  I'm not talking about the ones who are awake and aware.
[03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:15.740]  I love those people.
[03:34:15.920 --> 03:34:17.161]  I thank them for their courage.
[03:34:17.241 --> 03:34:18.361]  I thank them for standing up.
[03:34:18.641 --> 03:34:24.443]  I'm talking about how successful the years-long program of this programming was of the Australian people.
[03:34:24.743 --> 03:34:27.604]  They're running the same program here right now.
[03:34:28.625 --> 03:34:29.165]  Right now.
[03:34:31.263 --> 03:34:41.685]  And again, you may say it's not working, but there are vulnerable people out there who do not want to be associated with the criminal label, with the hateful label, with the racist label.
[03:34:44.945 --> 03:34:52.947]  So whilst they say, oh, we're going to double down on our rhetoric, but the conservatives need to stop, there's no, you need to double down.
[03:34:53.607 --> 03:34:55.607]  Resist this with everything that you have.
[03:34:56.547 --> 03:34:59.008]  And for as long as I'm here, I will help, believe you me.
[03:35:02.898 --> 03:35:06.648]  And we cannot, we cannot let these people overcome this country.
[03:35:06.668 --> 03:35:10.237]  You can't let it turn.
[03:35:12.153 --> 03:35:16.236]  into what has become of the ravaged West around us.
[03:35:16.696 --> 03:35:19.398]  Canada has no free speech.
[03:35:19.498 --> 03:35:21.459]  Free speech is dead in Canada.
[03:35:21.539 --> 03:35:23.921]  Australia has fallen where it comes to free speech.
[03:35:23.941 --> 03:35:27.023]  There is really a last ditch battle going on right now.
[03:35:27.283 --> 03:35:29.785]  The UK has fallen when it comes to free speech.
[03:35:29.985 --> 03:35:38.431]  We cannot have the same fate with America because America is the last stand for not just the West, the world.
[03:35:41.530 --> 03:35:50.413]  And you may think that this last video that I'm going to play is maybe not relevant to this, but it is, and I'll explain how.
[03:35:51.554 --> 03:35:58.016]  Team, if you can bring up the video of the Trump campaign talking about Bidenomics, please.
[03:36:05.402 --> 03:36:08.083]  Another day under Bidenomics.
[03:36:08.743 --> 03:36:12.645]  Morning coffee costs 65% more.
[03:36:13.105 --> 03:36:16.066]  Gas for getting to work costs doubled.
[03:36:16.386 --> 03:36:17.507]  Workers' incomes?
[03:36:17.947 --> 03:36:20.328]  Down three straight years.
[03:36:20.668 --> 03:36:23.269]  Groceries cost you 20% more.
[03:36:23.529 --> 03:36:24.569]  And mortgage payments?
[03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:26.210]  Astronomical.
[03:36:26.850 --> 03:36:30.592]  Bidenomics is working, and we are very proud of Bidenomics.
[03:36:31.431 --> 03:36:32.311]  Pleasant dreams.
[03:36:32.691 --> 03:36:34.872]  I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[03:36:36.632 --> 03:36:40.033]  Let me tell you how that is so profound.
[03:36:40.754 --> 03:36:43.794]  It's not just about the fact that coffee's up and fuel is up.
[03:36:43.874 --> 03:36:45.635]  It's really not just about that.
[03:36:47.155 --> 03:36:53.997]  You see, I come from a country with 46% income tax rates because it's been ravaged by socialists.
[03:36:55.337 --> 03:36:57.018]  Socialists like Kamala Harris.
[03:36:59.241 --> 03:37:04.044]  There's a tweet that I wrote down by hand from someone that I follow.
[03:37:04.104 --> 03:37:05.145]  His name's John Goddard.
[03:37:05.825 --> 03:37:07.546]  He wrote, he's Australian.
[03:37:07.926 --> 03:37:09.467]  I earn $200,000.
[03:37:10.208 --> 03:37:12.889]  I pay $90,000 in income tax.
[03:37:12.909 --> 03:37:14.450]  That's real in Australia, by the way.
[03:37:15.531 --> 03:37:23.496]  I pay a further $40,000 in council rates, fuel excise, licence fees, car registration, getting a new passport and inflation.
[03:37:24.016 --> 03:37:24.937]  My tax rate is 65%.
[03:37:28.322 --> 03:37:52.729]  So what happens over time, ladies and gentlemen, as they convince people that they're criminals if they keep a gun, if this place successfully puts further restrictions on guns, if this place successfully puts some sort of hate speech laws in, if Tim Walls successfully, as he did in Minnesota, protects pedophiles in the law.
[03:37:52.789 --> 03:37:53.449]  He did that.
[03:37:53.509 --> 03:37:57.070]  Yes, Tim Walls really loves protecting pedophiles, apparently.
[03:37:58.110 --> 03:38:10.289]  What happens is, over time, they will start waging lawfare against you for standing up to these things because bit by bit they've weaseled their way in.
[03:38:11.673 --> 03:38:21.618]  And then people, well-meaning people, people who don't want to break the law and be associated with the labels that we've been talking about today will say, well, I don't really want to speak about this.
[03:38:22.598 --> 03:38:27.260]  I can't afford my fuel, can't afford to travel to work.
[03:38:28.081 --> 03:38:30.122]  I'm actually struggling to feed my family.
[03:38:30.162 --> 03:38:40.707]  So if I speak, if I speak, I will not be able to afford the lawsuit that I saw them just bring against that guy for the meme that he posted.
[03:38:42.028 --> 03:38:48.932]  They scare you with isolated incidents that, by the way, are completely against the Constitution, but it doesn't matter because you can't afford to fight them.
[03:38:50.593 --> 03:38:56.616]  And bit by bit by bit, the number of people willing to speak reduces more and more.
[03:38:58.018 --> 03:39:01.342]  And that is their plan to demoralize America and you must not let them.
[03:39:01.442 --> 03:39:08.610]  If these people win, if these people win, this country in four years will be unrecognizable.
[03:39:08.690 --> 03:39:18.281]  I promise you that as someone who comes from a country that is unrecognizable because the people in leadership there are exactly like Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[03:39:22.102 --> 03:39:23.905]  It's not just specifically about them.
[03:39:23.986 --> 03:39:25.368]  It is the machine behind them.
[03:39:25.408 --> 03:39:26.951]  It is the ideology behind them.
[03:39:27.031 --> 03:39:31.359]  It is the globalist machine that wants to destroy us!
[03:39:33.891 --> 03:39:35.012]  And we can't let them.
[03:39:35.452 --> 03:39:45.957]  America, you must fight peacefully, lawfully with everything that you have over these next few months for the sake of this country and the rest of the world.
[03:39:46.037 --> 03:39:52.660]  Believe me, the whole world is watching and praying that things go the right way in November and beyond.
[03:39:55.102 --> 03:40:03.206]  And be mindful that they will pull out every single tactic in the book between now and then, between now and January, whatever way it goes.
[03:40:04.855 --> 03:40:06.336]  So keep your wits about you.
[03:40:06.756 --> 03:40:10.099]  Don't let them demoralise you and bring more people along the way.
[03:40:10.199 --> 03:40:18.505]  Show them this broadcast from an Australian that's begging you to never let your country turn into Australia because it happens without you even realising.
[03:40:18.545 --> 03:40:19.746]  It happens so quickly.
[03:40:19.766 --> 03:40:21.827]  It happens so quickly, America.
[03:40:21.888 --> 03:40:22.968]  You can't let this happen.
[03:40:23.289 --> 03:40:23.809]  Stand up.
[03:40:24.109 --> 03:40:25.230]  Don't forget who you are.
[03:40:25.310 --> 03:40:30.234]  Don't ever let them tell you that your First Amendment, your Second Amendment don't matter.
[03:40:30.254 --> 03:40:33.136]  Your God-given rights are above the Communists.
[03:40:33.716 --> 03:40:35.438]  And above what they tell you, God bless you.
[03:40:35.778 --> 03:40:37.639]  I'll see you all very, very soon.
[03:40:38.420 --> 03:40:41.702]  Today's conspiracy theories, tomorrow's truths.
[03:40:42.483 --> 03:40:46.626]  Some of these conspiracy theories have turned out to be true.
[03:40:47.887 --> 03:40:48.428]  Which ones?
[03:40:49.113 --> 03:41:17.534]  The Trump-Russia witch hunt, Jeffrey Epstein, JFK assassination, the misuse of the Patriot Act, the Iraq War, the weapons of mass destruction, the war in Ukraine, the bombing of the Nord Stream Pipeline, the open border migration caravans, the climate change scam, Kim Trails, and HARP, and 9-11 being an inside job, and the Internet of Things surveillance grid, and PFAs, and chemicals in the water turning everyone gay, and the 2020 election being stolen, and January 6 being filled with undercover feds, and Bilderberg, and Bohemian Grove, and global government, not to mention gain-of-function research, and the threat of China,
[03:41:17.754 --> 03:41:19.716]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:41:43.357 --> 03:41:47.182]  But it's an adventure to wear any of these shirts, but particularly this one.
[03:41:47.723 --> 03:41:51.708]  Get this design and so many others, they're limited edition, at TheAlexShimStore.com.

[03:41:58.217 --> 03:42:01.078]  You call in thanking me on air, I say stop because I'm thanking you.
[03:42:01.398 --> 03:42:02.778]  I love fighting the Globalist.
[03:42:03.198 --> 03:42:03.918]  This is what I do.
[03:42:03.978 --> 03:42:05.959]  We've had such a huge effect together.
