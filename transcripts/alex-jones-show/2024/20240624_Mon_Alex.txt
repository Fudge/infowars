[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.926]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:12.987]  Visit Infowars.com/show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:34.987]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:38.187]  [Music]
[00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:42.277]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:48.637]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:48.637 --> 00:01:04.638]   From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:21.638]  [Music]
[00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, June 24th, 2024.
[00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:33.358]  I'm your embattled host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, transmitting and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:41.301]  All right, Kim Dotcom, very iconic, very smart character, you know, goes way back with Elon Musk and everybody else in big tech.
[00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:47.744]  He is really informative, and I've always been a big fan of his political views and ideas.
[00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:49.806]  We had a chance to talk yesterday.
[00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:53.972]  He is finally going to come on the show, which is something on my bucket list.
[00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:57.456]  So look for that coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:03.084]  And if he likes how it's going, maybe into the third hour, or if not, we'll take calls after he leaves us.
[00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:10.621]  All hell's breaking loose, as usual, and we'll be going over it, well, a lot of it here in the first hour.
[00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:23.698]   We'll cover a lot of the news here in the first hour, and then we will segue into World War III news in the second hour, and then more in the third hour, but This is just insane.
[00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:31.264]  We have five Atacam ballistic missiles, they're called, that are heavy missiles.
[00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:32.225]  Huge.
[00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:43.195]  Rain cluster bombs down on Russian-controlled areas of Crimea, killing babies, women, children, you name it.
[00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:47.798]  And Russia is now vowing revenge, which is not a good idea.
[00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:50.878]  That's why they did this, why they targeted civilians.
[00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:54.859]  But the Russians have to respond or the Russian population will remove Putin.
[00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.620]  It was very popular, but seen as not being hardcore enough.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.841]  So, unlike here in the U.S.
[00:03:00.861 --> 00:03:06.622]  where Biden had to steal the election, it's not popular, no one denies that Putin's got like an 85% approval rating.
[00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:12.224]  And if Putin gets removed, we're gonna be dealing with people a lot more aggressive.
[00:03:13.244 --> 00:03:15.005]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:28.300]  The United States is now supplying ballistic missiles, high-tech versions of the Scud missile, basically.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.881]  They go up and they go down a big arc like a mortar, not a cruise missile that flies around the ground.
[00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:39.583]  Raining cluster bombs down, and that's illegal under international law.
[00:03:41.314 --> 00:03:44.776]  to to drop cluster bombs on civilian populations.
[00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:47.477]  Hell, it's illegal in most countries to drop it on troops.
[00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:50.098]  But they didn't care.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:07.687]  They directed it in on a beach and other areas in Crimea and Sebastopol that's been part of Russia for the start of Russia.
[00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:15.359]   So This is escalating very, very, very quickly.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.761]  Then in other news, the crime wave in Europe by the third world population they've brought in is incredible.
[00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.462]  The numbers are out in Germany, Spain, France.
[00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:35.045]  Over half the crime committed in Europe in these countries is committed by the illegal aliens.
[00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:39.046]  They're almost all military men that come there to loot and kill.
[00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.024]  So that's really important.
[00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:51.982]  We have a lot of Orwellian news of where the globalists are going and what they want to establish coming up as well today.
[00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:54.656]  They're setting up thought police around the world.
[00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:55.737]  They actually call them thought police.
[00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:56.618]  You can't make this up.
[00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.680]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.883]  We have a giant broadcast lined up for you.
[00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:02.964]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:05.826]  Please remember, you're the real power of the broadcast.
[00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:07.808]  Tell everyone you know and those you don't know.
[00:05:08.028 --> 00:05:30.028]   Tune in now at RealAlexJones on X and Infowars.com/show and on radio stations all over the country.
[00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:30.989]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.110]  today.
[00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:43.110]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:53.110]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:02.110]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:09.538]  1776! 1776! 1776! 1776!
[00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:11.538]  1776! 1776! 1776!
[00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:16.538]   So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:29.239]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to The UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally take everything you've got, including your children, away from you.
[00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:40.286]  And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari, they represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human.
[00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:42.247]  Well, we got news for them.
[00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.567]  The future is not globalist!
[00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:51.567]  [Cheering]
[00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:53.567]  The future is human.
[00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:59.753]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:01.395]  But let me tell you what it is.
[00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:14.365]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:18.308]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:26.183]  They have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.504]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:32.785]  Team Humanity!
[00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:37.226]  Team Humanity!
[00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:43.187]  Are you going to let them brainwash and take your children?
[00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:56.152]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:59.352]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:04.653]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[00:08:05.374 --> 00:08:11.555]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:17.412]  They declared war on us.
[00:08:18.273 --> 00:08:19.333]  They're attacking us.
[00:08:19.653 --> 00:08:20.714]  They're surveilling us.
[00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:22.074]  They're censoring us.
[00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:26.096]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:30.859]  We're simply recognizing it and saying we're not going to roll over and die.
[00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:41.106]   Our God is the God of the universe that created all There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:52.915]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so does his father, Prince Philip.
[00:08:53.435 --> 00:08:59.020]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists.
[00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:19.446]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:24.588]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible!
[00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:28.390]  Old-fashioned artillery.
[00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.870]  Genius.
[00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:33.568]  literally meltdown rock on their heads.
[00:09:33.568 --> 00:09:43.568]  [MUSIC]
[00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:53.568]  [MUSIC]
[00:09:53.568 --> 00:10:03.569]  [MUSIC]
[00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.149]  (upbeat music)
[00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:08.189]  It's Monday, June 24th, 2024.
[00:10:08.249 --> 00:10:14.092]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:10:14.372 --> 00:10:19.372]  Visit Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:10:19.372 --> 00:10:39.372]  133 days, 12 hours, 48 minutes, 43 seconds.
[00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:42.607]  The most important election in world history.
[00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.631]  And humanity is way out in front with the lead.
[00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:53.476]  But the forces of the New World Order aren't going to give up so easy and will be striking back with false flag terror attacks.
[00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.338]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:01.002]  Well, did we not in the last 30 years call the New World Order plan from their own documents?
[00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:02.143]  Are we not vindicated?
[00:11:02.183 --> 00:11:06.426]   Are we not The broadcast feared by tyrants, loved by patriots.
[00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:11.831]  And all of that was God working through myself and the crew and the listeners and supporters.
[00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:16.315]  But we're in a very strong position around the world.
[00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:23.521]  Every globalist policy out there from carbon taxes to transgenderism to open borders is in deep trouble.
[00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:25.023]  We have the initiative.
[00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:28.205]  We're winning the arm-wrestling match right now.
[00:11:28.365 --> 00:11:29.827]  It is ours to lose.
[00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:34.389]  That said, our enemies are pulling out the stops at every level.
[00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:50.252]  Kim Dotcom, the iconic tech entrepreneur, very intelligent, very reclusive, very informative when he does speak, is going to be joining us in the second hour in 48 minutes from now.
[00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:52.673]  So really looking forward to that.
[00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:55.973]  That was a big thing on my bucket list to get him on the show.
[00:11:56.033 --> 00:11:59.994]  We finally talked last night and that's going to be happening coming up from New Zealand.
[00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:06.844]  We'll hit all the World War III news then, because that's what we're going to be focusing on.
[00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:08.225]  That's the big front and center news.
[00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:11.948]  But just look at the mind control news in front of me.
[00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:20.514]  It doesn't matter whether you're in Germany, or Australia, or Canada, or the blue cities in the U.S., it's the same globalist operation.
[00:12:21.355 --> 00:12:30.262]  New Quebec curriculum will mandate second graders learn about gender identity and LGBTQIAAPS2S content.
[00:12:30.963 --> 00:12:31.243]  Grooming.
[00:12:33.922 --> 00:12:42.429]  That dovetails with UK PM proposes disabling driving licenses and financial services for youth avoiding the national draft.
[00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.670]  Ah!
[00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:46.372]  See what that's all about, the Castle Society?
[00:12:47.593 --> 00:12:54.379]  Australia introduces controversial mind control ministry aimed at controlling and changing men's behavior.
[00:12:56.081 --> 00:13:04.625]  That ties into DOJ is now indicted and targets whistleblower over secret child gender procedures that are illegal that the doctor exposed.
[00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:07.167]  Young doctor in his residency.
[00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:13.110]  As soon as he finished his residency, he was officially a doctor, he went public, and they're coming after him criminally.
[00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:20.853]  And let's just say he's a patriot, we've talked to him, but we're going to wait until he has his jury trial in federal court until he comes on the broadcast.
[00:13:20.893 --> 00:13:21.594]  Talked to him this morning.
[00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:31.536]  So, all of this ties together, what we're dealing with, what we're facing, we're going to be getting to that today, and so much more.
[00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:40.064]  But first, I want to go back to something, because I know a lot of folks tune into the Sinai Show, but it's got half the viewers and listeners this one does.
[00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:50.181]  You know, I started doing that show 16 years ago, about halfway into my career, because so many radio stations didn't want to pick up the Alex Jones Show weekdays.
[00:13:50.221 --> 00:13:53.501]  They said, well, let's just do a weekend show to give us a taste.
[00:13:54.121 --> 00:14:02.943]  I can't tell you, most of our hundreds of affiliates came from the Sunday show, where they would put the show on for a while, get great ratings, get great feedback, and put us on weekdays.
[00:14:03.723 --> 00:14:08.824]  But I've continued on to do it, but it's got about half the audience on average of the weekday transmission.
[00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:13.707]  Statistically, the biggest show for a reason is Wednesdays are our biggest show.
[00:14:13.747 --> 00:14:16.548]  Middle of the week, that's the biggest broadcast of the week.
[00:14:17.308 --> 00:14:20.210]  So I kind of want to repeat some of this because it's a big deal.
[00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.711]  And quite frankly, really, it has nothing to do with the fact that we have half the audience on Sunday.
[00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:32.675]  I should be talking about this every day for hours because the pre-programming, the preparation 100% tells you what they're going to do.
[00:14:33.888 --> 00:14:39.403]  Just like if you're a football coach and you see the other team's formation, you can tell they're going to run it, they're going to pass it.
[00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.849]  I mean, you know what's going on.
[00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:49.803]  And so the globalists have been all over the controlled news saying imminent white supremacist Trump supporter attacks.
[00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:50.803]  They're hiding in the woods.
[00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:51.743]  They're training.
[00:14:51.763 --> 00:14:52.424]  They're going to get us.
[00:14:53.044 --> 00:14:54.904]  Every major channel saying it constantly.
[00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.325]  There's going to be blood.
[00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:57.545]  Trump's going to be a dictator.
[00:14:57.925 --> 00:14:58.345]  You've heard it.
[00:14:58.385 --> 00:14:58.825]  You've seen it.
[00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:08.868]  Along with all the movies and TV shows and production in the fiction realm to kind of bolster and buttress and amplify that BS.
[00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:15.853]  So now Maxine Waters has emerged again and said, oh, there's going to be blood in the streets one way or the other.
[00:15:17.594 --> 00:15:20.556]  No, not the mostly peaceful demonstrations when they burned down half the country.
[00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:21.676]  No, no.
[00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:26.839]  She has no evidence of this, but she says there will be blood in the streets because of Trump, whether he wins or not.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:37.246]  So she just said a few weeks ago, I've had the briefings and the FBI needs to tell you the Trump supporters are training in the woods to kill black people.
[00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:40.804]  So think Governor Whitmer fake kidnapping plot, 10.0.
[00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:52.895]  So they've got wound up crazy white supremacists, ready to go, and ready to kill a bunch of black people, and you can just sit back and see it.
[00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:53.756]  What are they going to do?
[00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:57.459]  60% of Hispanics are now supporting Trump.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.103]  Upwards of 50% of blacks are now supporting, depending on the demographic.
[00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:04.085]  They are in full panic mode, so what do you do?
[00:16:05.213 --> 00:16:08.737]  Well, you wind up some crazies or you stage it yourself and you kill a bunch of black people.
[00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:10.879]  Think Jesse Smollett, but for real.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.841]  Very simple.
[00:16:13.702 --> 00:16:14.503]  That's what they're doing.
[00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.164]  What do we do about it is the bigger question.
[00:16:16.364 --> 00:16:16.825]  Here she is.
[00:16:19.468 --> 00:16:24.373]  How concerned are you, Congresswoman, about your safety if Donald Trump is reelected?
[00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:38.141]  Well, I'm very concerned, not only about my safety, and not only about the safety of members of Congress, I'm concerned about the safety of so many people in this country, particularly people of color.
[00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:47.184]  Trump has said that if he does not win, it's gonna be fraud.
[00:16:47.184 --> 00:16:51.264]   And because it's gonna be fraud, there's gonna be blood in the streets.
[00:16:51.264 --> 00:16:55.704]   He threatens about a civil war, and he threatens there's going to be violence.
[00:16:55.704 --> 00:17:00.223]   So I say all of this talk is motivational with many of those
[00:17:00.223 --> 00:17:03.664]  who are racist, who are sitting at home, listening to him.
[00:17:03.664 --> 00:17:09.223]   And they're taking him up on his threats, even before the elections take place.
[00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:18.264]   And so it's about thousands, maybe millions of people being threatened and being at risk because of Donald Trump and
[00:17:18.264 --> 00:17:22.944]  his desire to wreak revenge on anything and everybody.
[00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:23.783]  Thank you.
[00:17:23.783 --> 00:17:33.783]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:17:24.854 --> 00:17:26.575]  But that's exactly what the left's doing.
[00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:30.737]  Getting rid of our border, cutting off our energy, brainwashing our children, chipping in fentanyl.
[00:17:30.777 --> 00:17:34.139]  No, they're carrying out their revenge against the people.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.283]  So, something big happened with the Supreme Court ruling that just came out today.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:18:01.508]  And I'm not a lawyer, but I told you a month ago when the ruling came down a little less than a month ago in New York in the criminal trial, the Stormy Daniels Show trial, that the judge gave instructions to the jury that they don't have to be unanimous on the crimes, just agree that some crime was committed.
[00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:07.891]  Now, I called a bunch of lawyers after I read that and gave my opinion that you've got to be unanimous on each criminal charge.
[00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:12.333]  Because I researched the news, I've been in trials, I know how it works.
[00:18:12.693 --> 00:18:13.693]  The lawyers are all like, no, that's 100%.
[00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:25.417]  Well, now the Supreme Court has ruled on another case, because Democrat judges are doing this, because they let criminals out of jail that are caught red-handed.
[00:18:27.137 --> 00:18:31.358]  Well, they let them off, but if you're a patriot, they'll throw the book at you for even defending yourself.
[00:18:33.659 --> 00:18:40.520]   So now, the Supreme Court has ruled that juries Must be unanimous on each criminal count.
[00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:48.351]  Trump's jury was not unanimous, writes Jack Posobiec, in its findings 444 on the underlying crime.
[00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:52.738]  This means conviction was directly unconstitutional and must be overturned.
[00:18:54.505 --> 00:19:09.592]  In a 6-3 decision issued today, the Supreme Court ruled that a jury must be unanimous in its findings of criminal convictions and two sentencing enhancements cannot be arbitrary implemented by judicial fiat.
[00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:18.756]  And here is the actual ruling from the Supreme Court of the United States.
[00:19:21.437 --> 00:19:22.738]  There on screen for you.
[00:19:27.327 --> 00:19:31.710]  So, they knew what they were doing was illegal.
[00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:34.933]  They knew what they were doing was a total fraud.
[00:19:36.254 --> 00:19:37.715]  But they didn't care.
[00:19:39.216 --> 00:19:44.480]  The judge said, you don't all have to agree unanimously on this criminal charge.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.965]  Just in general, if you think he did one of these things, you pull all that together, and then you find him guilty.
[00:19:52.162 --> 00:19:53.623]  That's not what the law says on his face.
[00:19:54.283 --> 00:19:57.965]  So we didn't really need the Supreme Court to say this, but they just did on another case.
[00:19:59.526 --> 00:20:02.387]  So, this is the crazy town we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:03.988 --> 00:20:07.690]  Absolute, total, and complete crazy town.
[00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.751]  And pull up the Club of Judge Judy I played yesterday.
[00:20:10.312 --> 00:20:18.176]  She got asked, and she said, you know, you have to tie yourself into a pretzel just to find the crime.
[00:20:20.478 --> 00:20:23.780]  That Trump supposedly did that, much less was he guilty.
[00:20:25.061 --> 00:20:28.063]  And it's from a convicted liar who admits he was stealing money from Trump.
[00:20:30.325 --> 00:20:31.526]  So let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:56.616]  I would be happier, as someone who owns property in Manhattan, if the District Attorney of New York County would take care of criminals who are making it impossible for citizens to walk in the streets and use the subway, to use his efforts to keep those people off the street, than to spend $5 million or $10 million of taxpayers' money trying Donald Trump on this nonsense.
[00:20:57.317 --> 00:20:57.917]  That's my view.
[00:20:59.037 --> 00:21:09.388]  But I, as a taxpayer in this country, resent using the system for your own personal self-aggrandizement.
[00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:14.814]  Now, if you didn't know... And that's what you think the DA did in Manhattan?
[00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:15.806]  That's what I think.
[00:21:16.266 --> 00:21:21.852]  I mean, if you look, you had to twist yourself into a pretzel to figure out what the crime was.
[00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:23.394]  He doesn't like him.
[00:21:24.235 --> 00:21:26.757]  New York City didn't like him for a while.
[00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:27.218]  Trump.
[00:21:27.238 --> 00:21:27.418]  Trump.
[00:21:27.718 --> 00:21:29.000]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[00:21:31.602 --> 00:21:32.383]  What do I think of him?
[00:21:35.987 --> 00:21:46.186]   I think he was A good businessman, a real estate guy, and he was certainly terrific on The Apprentice.
[00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:50.287]  Now, I want to be completely clear, 100% clear on this.
[00:21:51.187 --> 00:21:54.328]  I believe the globalists, if they can get away with it, will still stage some false flags.
[00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:57.668]  Power outages, cyber attacks, God knows what they'll do.
[00:21:57.688 --> 00:22:04.510]  They're already trying to expand the war into full thermonuclear war as a political distraction because everything they've done has backfired and is killing the dollar.
[00:22:06.735 --> 00:22:21.019]  That said, though, I've seen a shift the last few weeks in corporate media, enemy media, enemy of the people media, that, okay, this is what we're going to do when Trump wins, and how they're going to obstruct, and how they're going to riot, and how they're going to block, and how they're going to sue, and what they're going to do.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.901]  So they're already shifting to him winning in 133 days.
[00:22:27.902 --> 00:22:33.107]  And they normally telegraph exactly what they're going to do, like they said on PBS and CNN, months before the election.
[00:22:33.147 --> 00:22:37.392]  Don't worry, said Bloomberg, it'll look like a red wave, it's a red mirage.
[00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:43.798]  We'll have as many ballots as we need once the ballot box is closed, once the polls close.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.462]  We will have whatever we need to beat Trump.
[00:22:48.874 --> 00:22:49.875]  And then they did that.
[00:22:50.696 --> 00:22:55.139]  So, they tell their minions what they're going to do, and right now they're saying, okay, Trump's going to win.
[00:22:55.179 --> 00:23:06.389]  Now, we're going to see Thursday night, and I'll be here with Owen Schroer and Harrison and Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser and a bunch of other special guests.
[00:23:06.889 --> 00:23:11.113]  We'll do an hour before the debate, and then we'll have limited comments during the debate.
[00:23:11.133 --> 00:23:15.056]  We'll do an hour after Thursday night, so mark your calendars.
[00:23:15.757 --> 00:23:17.138]  That's only in three days from now.
[00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:20.578]  We're going to be covering it all live.
[00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:21.698]  This is going to be spectacular.
[00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:24.781]  Biden has demanded that he be able to sit.
[00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:26.822]  They've got a CNN moderator.
[00:23:26.842 --> 00:23:28.123]  I mean, Trump's walking into a trap.
[00:23:28.183 --> 00:23:28.644]  You know that.
[00:23:29.945 --> 00:23:33.007]  But he's still going to clean, clean his clock.
[00:23:33.948 --> 00:23:38.952]  And I've got another video we'll get to later, but Trump said he can fall off the stage.
[00:23:38.992 --> 00:23:41.394]  Trump complains he's called cognitively impaired.
[00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:44.396]  Over.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.845]  One word, but Biden can run into walls and it's fine.
[00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:57.833]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:03.859]  This is Bill Maher and Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, was also a former prosecutor.
[00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:06.870]  Saying this is terrible what was done to Trump.
[00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.311]  It's wrong.
[00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.713]  They're not doing that because they like America or like Trump.
[00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:13.555]  They're doing it because we are beyond the landslide.
[00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:15.236]  We're at a global political realignment.
[00:24:15.576 --> 00:24:18.699]  Populist, conservatives, nationalists, Christians are being elected everywhere.
[00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:31.488]  The New World Order is done if they don't overturn the entire political chessboard with a giant war or a huge cyber attack that cuts the power off.
[00:24:31.548 --> 00:24:36.422]   I mean, and if you think they won't do that, if they think That they can get away with it.
[00:24:37.383 --> 00:24:37.843]  Think again.
[00:24:38.903 --> 00:24:44.966]  So, I'll guarantee you, I've been to the big councils of the CIA and the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Foundation, and then MI6.
[00:24:45.606 --> 00:24:47.027]  They're a big part of it.
[00:24:47.147 --> 00:24:56.870]  They're debating whether to do false flags, they're debating whether to do a cyber attack, they're debating whether to, they've already escalated with Russia, trying to get Russia to get more aggressive so they don't have some pretext to go to full war.
[00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.771]  They've got the national drafts set up and ready everywhere.
[00:25:00.972 --> 00:25:03.673]  So, they're sitting there looking at their cards in their hand there.
[00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:07.911]  They're looking at the people of the world saying, will they put up with this?
[00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:09.913]  They've already tried their bird flu.
[00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:13.235]  They've already tried all the rest of the stuff that's not working.
[00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:14.256]  People aren't buying it.
[00:25:14.276 --> 00:25:15.557]  They're not getting into the hysteria.
[00:25:15.817 --> 00:25:16.958]  They're not following the orders.
[00:25:16.978 --> 00:25:18.279]  They're not lining up and doing it.
[00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.040]  They got all their fake PCR tests.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.921]  They're slaughtering cows all over the country and chickens.
[00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:28.446]  And so everything they're gauging, everything they're test ballooning isn't working.
[00:25:32.563 --> 00:25:36.547]  So do they just pull back and then crash the economy and blame Trump?
[00:25:36.707 --> 00:25:38.609]  Trump has said that's what he's mainly worried about.
[00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:39.770]  I think Trump's right.
[00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:43.334]  We've still got to have massive turnout.
[00:25:43.374 --> 00:25:49.400]  We've still got to realize they could pull a side move on us when we zig, they zag.
[00:25:51.462 --> 00:25:55.727]  I'd say 40% chance they stage massive cyber attacks, terror attacks.
[00:25:58.195 --> 00:26:01.554]   and go to full martial law. But I think we've gone to 60% chance.
[00:26:01.554 --> 00:26:04.836]   They're still considering though, they're still gauging something might change.
[00:26:04.836 --> 00:26:11.315]   Letting Trump get in because they can't stop a landslide like this, too obvious,
[00:26:11.315 --> 00:26:17.074]   and then tanging the economy. I mean, I think that's where we're at right now. And again,
[00:26:17.074 --> 00:26:20.754]   they haven't made their decisions either. So I'm trying to gauge them and their propaganda,
[00:26:20.754 --> 00:26:22.995]  but they're very desperate right now.
[00:26:23.193 --> 00:26:27.154]  And all their minions, not just Cuomo and not just Bill Maher.
[00:26:27.654 --> 00:26:29.215]  I mean, almost all of them.
[00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:33.136]  I mean, they've got all the people that were in Fauci's group running around.
[00:26:33.196 --> 00:26:34.416]  Oh, we never made you wear a mask.
[00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:35.576]  We never said take the shots.
[00:26:35.976 --> 00:26:44.298]  By the way, it's mainstream prestigious studies out of South Korea and out of Germany that the shots cause Alzheimer's and infertility.
[00:26:44.338 --> 00:26:46.178]  I mean, that's a huge other insane stack.
[00:26:46.478 --> 00:26:48.739]  I mean, this is wild stuff.
[00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:52.251]  Here's a clip of Cuomo.
[00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:56.708]  The trial in New York, the one he got convicted for.
[00:26:58.103 --> 00:26:59.904]  Was the greatest fundraising bonanza ever.
[00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:00.024]  Yes.
[00:27:00.224 --> 00:27:04.206]  He is now, he was lagging behind Biden and now he's pulled quite a bit ahead.
[00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:13.511]  That trial was the greatest reason people had to send their checks for 5, 10, 25, whatever dollars to Donald Trump.
[00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:17.653]  So I was always with you on the one in New York, the hush money trial.
[00:27:17.673 --> 00:27:19.034]  I don't think they should have brought that one.
[00:27:19.414 --> 00:27:24.097]  It was just always going to look like a sex case and people were always just going to look at it that way.
[00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:29.658]  That case, the Attorney General's case in New York, frankly, should have never been brought.
[00:27:30.118 --> 00:27:38.080]  And if his name was not Donald Trump, and if he wasn't running for president from the former AG in New York, I'm telling you that case would have never been brought.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.741]  And that's what is offensive to people.
[00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:46.722]  And it should be, because if there's anything left, it's belief in the justice system.
[00:27:47.982 --> 00:27:50.863]  So they pulled it, it didn't work, now they're acting like they weren't for it.
[00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:53.351]  Just remember who these people are.
[00:27:54.012 --> 00:27:55.214]  Not out of some vindictiveness.
[00:27:55.234 --> 00:27:56.215]  We're not going to go after them.
[00:27:56.536 --> 00:27:59.099]  But just don't ever listen to a damn thing they ever say again.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.503]  That's their punishment is abstention.
[00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:03.485]  Their punishment is purgatory.
[00:28:04.186 --> 00:28:05.228]  We're going to shun these people.
[00:28:05.748 --> 00:28:06.409]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:06.469 --> 00:28:07.351]  Huge news straight ahead.
[00:28:07.371 --> 00:28:07.811]  Stay with us.
[00:28:07.992 --> 00:28:08.793]  Kim Dotcom coming up.

[00:29:05.449 --> 00:29:08.887]   I want to thank you all for spreading the word because without you, we are nothing.
[00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:15.048]   Again, I want to remind you every hour, not out of humorous, not out of arrogance,
[00:29:15.048 --> 00:29:22.489]   not out of pride, but out of satisfaction and commitment, that we're kicking New World Order ass together.
[00:29:22.558 --> 00:29:36.006]  We are the tip of the spear of this broadcast, our audience of activists, people are listening all over the world, government agencies are listening, world leaders are listening, top billionaires are listening, and people know we're serious and we know what we're talking about.
[00:29:36.824 --> 00:29:46.069]  And that we've exposed that the globalist plan is a betrayal of humanity, a post-industrial world, a nightmare, endless war, hellscape.
[00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.611]  And so our job is easy.
[00:29:49.351 --> 00:29:51.312]  Expose it for decades before they launch it.
[00:29:52.273 --> 00:29:55.915]  When they launch it, we're not caught flat-footed and people are like, whoa, this is incredible.
[00:29:56.615 --> 00:29:57.036]  And it is.
[00:29:57.896 --> 00:30:06.482]   And that's why they want us off the air so incredibly bad, ladies and gentlemen, because 30 years ago?
[00:30:06.502 --> 00:30:08.643]  I started InfoWars 27 years ago.
[00:30:08.663 --> 00:30:09.563]  I don't want to air 30.
[00:30:10.323 --> 00:30:11.583]  Nobody knew what InfoWars was.
[00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:17.284]  Well, I was researching it and being advised by former patriots.
[00:30:18.384 --> 00:30:24.445]  They were current patriots, but former intelligence officers that said, what you do is InfoWars, Vic Freeland, Air Force Intelligence.
[00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:27.466]  Let's see if InfoWars is available.
[00:30:27.486 --> 00:30:29.726]  He goes, oh, that's not available, but InfoWars is.
[00:30:30.767 --> 00:30:32.447]  And he sat there with my credit card and bought it for $9.
[00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:35.790]  At his house in Central Austin.
[00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.510]  He was the Deputy Fire Chief at the time.
[00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.310]  Great guy.
[00:30:41.091 --> 00:30:42.391]  Lives out in Bastrop right now.
[00:30:43.832 --> 00:30:45.112]  Oh, come on, he says he's too old.
[00:30:45.132 --> 00:30:47.413]  I guess he was 60 years old.
[00:30:47.433 --> 00:30:51.694]  27, 28 years ago, so I guess, yeah.
[00:30:52.054 --> 00:30:53.214]  What a great guy, though.
[00:30:53.274 --> 00:30:55.375]  I just reminisce about all the patriots I've gotten to know.
[00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:01.941]  So, I remember when the Feds were coming after me and the Democrat Party lost since they were always in the depositions.
[00:31:02.341 --> 00:31:03.401]  Who gave you InfoWars?
[00:31:03.441 --> 00:31:04.161]  Who gave you the name?
[00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:05.021]  Who's advising you?
[00:31:05.061 --> 00:31:05.762]  Who's in control?
[00:31:05.822 --> 00:31:06.522]  Who's in command?
[00:31:07.062 --> 00:31:07.942]  Who's your controller?
[00:31:08.202 --> 00:31:08.943]  Is it the Mercer's?
[00:31:09.023 --> 00:31:15.824]  Is it that I'm like, they finally got all our books and it's like, it's just Lister's buying product and it's us here on air and we just study this stuff.
[00:31:16.665 --> 00:31:20.046]  And now what we talked about 20, 30 years ago is mainstream news.
[00:31:20.746 --> 00:31:24.507]  So that's my frustration is that this is all available information.
[00:31:26.252 --> 00:31:27.493]  Everybody can know what I know.
[00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:28.813]  This is not secret stuff.
[00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:30.414]  This is hidden in plain view.
[00:31:31.234 --> 00:31:36.797]  Sure, I told you 25, 28 years ago about Satanists and the government pedophilia.
[00:31:36.837 --> 00:31:38.477]  That's because there was evidence of it.
[00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:44.300]  And I had former top generals and former top FBI giving me evidence of it.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:59.524]   And so again, that's why I've been so accurate, is that I literally was able to interface with the last wave of people Who were at conferences and writing underground books, who knew way more than I've ever known.
[00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:03.347]  But I was there and I had a popular show.
[00:32:03.747 --> 00:32:05.468]  So they fed me the information.
[00:32:05.808 --> 00:32:08.350]  And over the years I learned about it and learned more and more.
[00:32:11.192 --> 00:32:16.175]  But... The teacher appears when the student is ready.
[00:32:18.116 --> 00:32:23.240]  But as... Aristotle said, I know that I know nothing.
[00:32:24.633 --> 00:32:25.815]  These people think they know everything.
[00:32:26.095 --> 00:32:27.156]  They truly know nothing.
[00:32:27.697 --> 00:32:31.442]  Those that learn a lot learn that compared to all the information in the universe, you do know nothing.
[00:32:31.843 --> 00:32:34.006]  But compared to those that think they know everything, you know everything.
[00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:45.114]  So that's where we are and I just want to remind people about how far we've come and how epic this journey's been and how the New World Order is in so much trouble right now.
[00:32:45.154 --> 00:32:56.483]  They've still got the central banks, they've still got BlackRock, they're still squeezing the public and trying to bankrupt people and trying to implode the third world and use them as a weapon system against us with replacement migration.
[00:32:57.564 --> 00:33:01.927]  But at least we're not taking it lying down and we're starting to win.
[00:33:02.808 --> 00:33:05.010]  So please support InfoWars.
[00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:07.022]  The products are amazing.
[00:33:07.822 --> 00:33:08.783]  They're on sale right now.

[00:33:12.286 --> 00:33:22.094]  40% off on the best-selling products from Ultra 12 to Ultimate Fish Oil, highest grade, to Nitric Boost to Survival Shield X3 that's selling out.

[00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:24.536]  It's discounted.

[00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:28.979]  BNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.324]  Dazzo Beats that's very similar to Nitric Boost but different formula.
[00:33:36.377 --> 00:33:38.240]  People ask, what works better?
[00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:43.888]  Bazzo beet concentrate of the chemical in beets or nitric boost?
[00:33:43.928 --> 00:33:46.612]  It's like two different things, but they both work.
[00:33:47.807 --> 00:33:58.734]  I mean, if I had to say, for me, nitric boost works better, and it's not sold as that, but it has a Viagra effect, because it's the exact same stuff that's in there.
[00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:05.739]  So, everything you see in medicine is just a copy or a twisted version of what is in nature.
[00:34:05.799 --> 00:34:10.922]  We don't sell it as that, and it's not a drug, it's just all natural compounds, but it is dramatic.

[00:35:18.739 --> 00:35:22.002]  Now, I'm sure he'll be here in 20 minutes, but he's making me a little nervous.
[00:35:22.082 --> 00:35:23.503]  We've been sending him texts and I haven't got anything back.
[00:35:23.523 --> 00:35:24.544]  But he's supposed to be on in 20 minutes.
[00:35:24.884 --> 00:35:28.027]  Very excited about Kim.com coming on the show to talk about World War III.
[00:35:28.047 --> 00:35:32.851]  But let me just give you a prelude of what's coming up with these headlines here.
[00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:35.914]  Russia warns the U.S.
[00:35:35.954 --> 00:35:40.777]  to brace for retaliation after Kremlin blamed Washington for missile attack that killed foreign Crimean.
[00:35:43.378 --> 00:35:48.782]  That's like saying, oh, Russia claims the West blew up Nord Stream.
[00:35:49.182 --> 00:35:50.042]  Later, they admitted it.
[00:35:52.124 --> 00:35:55.626]  Russia unveils anti-drone robot named after Disney character WALL-E.
[00:35:55.646 --> 00:35:57.647]  We're going to show you that video come up in a moment.
[00:35:59.082 --> 00:36:05.047]  Crimea submailer struck by deadly shrapnel from Ukraine missile, including several children dead.
[00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:07.750]  Russia says U.S.
[00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.671]  responsible for deadly Ukrainian attack on Crimea.
[00:36:10.012 --> 00:36:14.295]  Well, I mean, the West gave them the missiles and said we're going to start striking civilian targets.
[00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:16.317]  It's got to be the news.
[00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:18.839]  Moscow summons U.S.
[00:36:18.898 --> 00:36:21.978]  over civilian deaths in Sevastopol attack.
[00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:24.138]  (silence)
[00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:27.538]  Government rampage through Russian churches and synagogues.
[00:36:27.538 --> 00:36:29.917]  Kills 15 people, including six police.
[00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:31.378]  You know that's Western sponsored.
[00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:34.417]   It's like the attack on the theater a few months ago in Moscow.
[00:36:34.417 --> 00:36:37.699]  So it's escalating quickly.
[00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:40.117]  What did Jack Posobiec say four or five months ago?
[00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:43.998]   He said, "They've hired as the new head "of the Ukrainian military,
[00:36:43.998 --> 00:36:46.398]  "a guy that specializes in terrorism.
[00:36:46.398 --> 00:36:48.438]  "Look for terror attacks inside Russia.
[00:36:48.438 --> 00:36:56.878]   "To manipulate Russia into a response, "show that the West could mischaracterize that
[00:36:56.878 --> 00:36:59.219]  "and escalate to full war."
[00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:04.478]   With the national draft set up all over Europe, national drafting set up here in the United States, the UK.
[00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:07.376]  This is absolute crazy town.
[00:37:08.956 --> 00:37:11.337]  And that brings us to this next key piece of intel.
[00:37:12.137 --> 00:37:14.018]  Big article up on Infowars.com.
[00:37:14.678 --> 00:37:24.000]   UK Prime Minister Proposes disabling driver's license and financial services for youth avoiding national service.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.381]  So that's the social credit score.
[00:37:28.322 --> 00:37:42.829]  And this guy, who's putting up the control grid all over his country, wants to then turn everybody's credit cards off, their bank accounts off, if they don't accept the national draft.
[00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.750]  Literal slavery to fight for the New World Order.
[00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:58.538]  Rishi Sundak, the British Prime Minister, recently shocked the nation with a proposal reminiscent of social credit systems in the United Kingdom.
[00:37:58.978 --> 00:38:08.781]  The plan suggested restricting access to essential modern conveniences like cars and financial services for youth, young individuals, refusing to participate in national service.
[00:38:09.381 --> 00:38:18.144]  During a Thursday night national television forum, election party heads fielded audience questions on BBC hosted program.
[00:38:21.815 --> 00:38:31.789]  Sunak found himself defending a novel electoral promise, the introduction of a mandatory national service for British use if he could retain a seat.
[00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:38.097]  Despite bleak poll evaluation and mounting public pressure, he refused to accept the possibility of defeat.
[00:38:39.065 --> 00:38:47.947]  Our Prime Minister utilized the case of volunteer ambulance service, that's how they started, and it's military, to illustrate potential forms of obligated volunteering.
[00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:57.109]  Nonetheless, the public's worrying debates have predominantly revolved around the compulsory military aspect of national service.
[00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:08.236]   And we went on to say that we'll have a set of sanctions and incentives And we will look at the models that are existing in Europe to get the appropriate mix of those.
[00:39:08.276 --> 00:39:15.058]  There is a range of different opinions that exist, whether that's looking at driving licenses, access to finance, he said.
[00:39:16.818 --> 00:39:21.680]  Now it's one thing if you think your country's just and it's in a war and you've been attacked to have conscription.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.241]  And when the public thinks it's right, they get behind it.
[00:39:24.901 --> 00:39:28.602]  But to go fight the Russians in a war the West started covertly ten years ago?
[00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:33.881]  It's cost hundreds of billions of dollars and killed over a million people?
[00:39:36.162 --> 00:39:38.704]  No, people don't want to go fight and die for the New World Order.
[00:39:40.365 --> 00:39:44.407]  How about King Charles right out there on his horse with his sword and he can go fight the Russians?
[00:39:46.188 --> 00:39:51.791]  So, that's where we are in all of this and it's a giant deal.
[00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:53.852]  And they mean business.
[00:39:56.129 --> 00:39:58.651]  So that's what they're going to do with the Cashless Society.
[00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:01.513]  I hadn't been to Martin Springs in about a year.
[00:40:02.974 --> 00:40:17.345]  And Saturday, I took my daughters down there, and I noticed they put in cashless paying kiosks to get into the big spring.
[00:40:19.287 --> 00:40:21.969]  And we got there like 9 in the morning, knowing huge crowds would be there.
[00:40:22.029 --> 00:40:23.971]  So we got there ahead of the crowds, barely got in.
[00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:26.217]  Barely had parking.
[00:40:27.398 --> 00:40:34.083]  And I walk over to the little shack where I've been going since I was a kid, you know, to pay the old days, 50 cents and then a dollar and then five dollars now.
[00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:39.367]  And I said, so, let me guess, are they going to get rid of cash soon?
[00:40:39.387 --> 00:40:41.109]  She says, yeah, we heard that next year.
[00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:50.856]  So all these towers, they're like just square metal towers that have a computer interface.
[00:40:51.537 --> 00:40:53.218]  I said, soon, that's all it'll be here.
[00:40:53.258 --> 00:40:53.659]  She said, yep.
[00:40:54.775 --> 00:40:55.936]  I said, don't you care about your job?
[00:40:57.216 --> 00:40:59.938]  Again, that's what getting rid of cash means.
[00:40:59.998 --> 00:41:03.500]  It's not like some innovation where you get rid of horses and have cars.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.321]  It's not like some innovation we chose that works.
[00:41:07.141 --> 00:41:14.886]  They're bringing a cashless society so in the future, you try to go to the Barton Springs or a park or anywhere, and they can just say no because of the social credit score.
[00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:16.586]  That is the plan.
[00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:18.067]  That is the program.
[00:41:18.427 --> 00:41:19.248]  That's what's going on.
[00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:36.221]  So the Casual Society is about total control over every aspect of your life, and not just that you accept the mark, you have to then bow down to the beast and follow all of its directives and live your life the way it says, with always new changing rules, to be able to do it.
[00:41:37.822 --> 00:41:42.785]  Yep, National Park Service sued over casuals' entry at parks, historic sites across the U.S.
[00:41:43.585 --> 00:41:44.466]  This is an agenda.
[00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:48.969]  They built a water burger a mile from my house.
[00:41:50.888 --> 00:41:51.308]  In Austin.
[00:41:52.449 --> 00:41:53.850]  Where there's no human contact.
[00:41:54.431 --> 00:41:55.632]  They call it a digital kitchen.
[00:41:55.652 --> 00:41:56.952]  Of course, no one goes to it.
[00:41:56.973 --> 00:41:57.833]  It's very unpopular.
[00:41:59.234 --> 00:42:00.615]  And it's broken most of the time.
[00:42:00.635 --> 00:42:01.476]  I drive by it every day.
[00:42:02.056 --> 00:42:04.018]  And there's signs up saying, oh, we're broken right now.
[00:42:04.518 --> 00:42:05.739]  So, why'd they do that?
[00:42:05.779 --> 00:42:08.901]  Because BlackRock has unlimited money out of nowhere.
[00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:10.482]  Out of fiat.
[00:42:10.823 --> 00:42:11.663]  They will pay.
[00:42:12.524 --> 00:42:13.565]  You go to the airports now.
[00:42:15.521 --> 00:42:15.841]  Anywhere!
[00:42:16.121 --> 00:42:16.942]  Small airport's big.
[00:42:16.962 --> 00:42:21.024]  You can't go get a human to make you a taco, or a hamburger, or a salad.
[00:42:22.004 --> 00:42:40.032]  It's all just a robot, and you type it out of some conveyor belt, some crappy food comes, but I noticed when I went to Detroit, uh, we can have a go, and at the Austin Airport and in Detroit Airport, there was almost nobody going to the kiosk, the robot food courts.
[00:42:40.472 --> 00:42:41.833]  In fact, most of them were closed.
[00:42:43.715 --> 00:42:44.536]  And that's the good news.
[00:42:44.576 --> 00:42:52.740]  Just like they created the digital hellscape of the metaverse and they put twenty-something billion dollars in it and almost no one used it.
[00:42:53.881 --> 00:42:58.104]  And so it was not adopted with the VR goggles and then putting us into their fantasy land.
[00:42:58.344 --> 00:43:13.153]  So then they just try to target elementary school kids and toddlers with them to make them do it in elementary schools and in preschools to get them habituated to use it just like criminals selling drugs to kids on the schoolyard.
[00:43:14.448 --> 00:43:15.149]  That's all they've got.
[00:43:15.709 --> 00:43:17.210]  Yeah, put the digital kitchen thing back up.
[00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.412]  So there's a digital, there's a bunch of these in Austin.
[00:43:19.853 --> 00:43:20.893]  There's one close to my house.
[00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:21.614]  I drive by it every day.
[00:43:22.355 --> 00:43:26.338]  Whataburger debuts new digital kitchen.
[00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:28.820]  All the flavor with more convenience.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.261]  Scroll down.
[00:43:30.602 --> 00:43:36.527]  Imagine, you pull up to a thing, you punch into a kiosk, and it comes out of a hole in the wall, and you don't see the people.
[00:43:37.828 --> 00:43:44.786]   Now, there are people inside They haven't replaced them fully with robots, but who's smarter is Chick-fil-A.
[00:43:46.187 --> 00:43:51.292]  You go to Chick-fil-A, and they got little robots coming to your table to deliver your food.
[00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:55.476]  Folks, this is about getting rid of people.
[00:43:58.479 --> 00:44:01.642]  But you notice all these photos, you see people in the digital kitchen?
[00:44:02.623 --> 00:44:02.743]  No.
[00:44:04.858 --> 00:44:06.459]  Because no one wants to use them.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:12.385]  You drive by a regular Whataburger, 24 hours a day, there's a line of cars around and it's full of people, you barely get a seat.
[00:44:15.408 --> 00:44:20.773]  But, Digital Kitchen, I drive by this one and other ones, I'm like, oh, I see a car today!
[00:44:20.793 --> 00:44:24.656]  Oh, I see somebody at the kiosk, and then I pull over and it says, kiosk broken.
[00:44:25.957 --> 00:44:26.838]  Order on your app.
[00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.969]   And the person sits there, But he's like, yeah, I've been waiting.
[00:44:32.989 --> 00:44:34.910]  I pulled over there actually, actually talked to a lady that was there.
[00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.931]  She goes, I've been waiting 20 minutes for this.
[00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:39.051]  I'm just going to drive the one, you know, five miles away.
[00:44:40.252 --> 00:44:49.234]  You wait 20 minutes out there standing there in the heat at a kiosk at a building with black windows on it to get a burger out of a hole in the wall.
[00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:52.415]  You want humans to do it because you're pro-human.
[00:44:52.455 --> 00:44:53.576]  We choose our environment.
[00:44:53.876 --> 00:44:55.136]  We choose the world we want to be in.
[00:44:57.317 --> 00:44:59.257]  They're trying to make us obsolete.
[00:44:59.337 --> 00:45:01.198]  I didn't mean to go off in a jag about that.
[00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:02.845]  But it's a big deal.
[00:45:03.265 --> 00:45:12.867]  Now, I mentioned earlier Trump saying Biden can fall off a stage, doesn't know his name, but then they claim Trump has cognitive issues.
[00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:15.428]  At 78, Trump is amazing.
[00:45:15.748 --> 00:45:17.268]  He's got more energy than I had at 20.
[00:45:17.428 --> 00:45:24.590]  I mean, Trump's not perfect, but my God, the man is a... We try to get him to stop it.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:37.503]  When the show trial was going on in New York, he would leave at five o'clock, go to a rally, fly back at 2 a.m., sleep three hours, get up in the morning, go back to court and do it again and again and again.
[00:45:38.443 --> 00:45:41.504]  That is superhuman type behavior.
[00:45:42.424 --> 00:45:44.685]  And we're like, sir, just rest, sir, just rest.
[00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:47.005]  But he he just gets off on it.
[00:45:47.025 --> 00:45:48.186]  But here's Trump.
[00:45:49.786 --> 00:45:53.047]  But the FBI crime statistics Biden is pushing are fake.
[00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:53.707]  They're fake.
[00:45:54.738 --> 00:45:56.920]  Just like everything else in this administration.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.343]  Now he's even saying that all his mishaps were fake.
[00:46:00.903 --> 00:46:04.423]  They say the fake news covered him in a fake manner.
[00:46:04.423 --> 00:46:10.422]  [crowd booing]
[00:46:10.422 --> 00:46:12.422]  That's a lot of fake news.
[00:46:12.422 --> 00:46:22.422]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:16.495]  That's a lot of fake news back there.
[00:46:16.495 --> 00:46:27.495]  [crowd cheering]
[00:46:27.495 --> 00:46:29.495]  All we want them to do is be honest.
[00:46:29.513 --> 00:46:32.374]  Because they're all going out of business.
[00:46:32.434 --> 00:46:33.774]  Nobody believes him anymore.
[00:46:35.355 --> 00:46:39.416]  And it didn't help when they went along with the Biden scam.
[00:46:39.776 --> 00:46:40.436]  What is he called?
[00:46:41.677 --> 00:46:42.337]  What is he called?
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.461]  You know what he calls it?
[00:46:44.681 --> 00:46:47.663]  So they get him in about nine different positions.
[00:46:48.644 --> 00:46:52.707]  I mean, even normal positions, although I assume he's been in some very bad ones.
[00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:56.870]  But they get him in all these horrible compromising posts.
[00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:58.911]  And then they say he wasn't.
[00:46:59.091 --> 00:47:00.192]  It really wasn't that way.
[00:47:00.933 --> 00:47:02.154]  Then everybody sends in.
[00:47:02.314 --> 00:47:03.195]  They all have cameras.
[00:47:03.215 --> 00:47:04.576]  See, every one of you have a camera.
[00:47:05.376 --> 00:47:10.901]  If I blow it up here, though, they actually, they take a perfect, brilliant, beautiful statement that I make.
[00:47:11.381 --> 00:47:13.643]  I go for two hours without teleprompters.
[00:47:14.263 --> 00:47:20.508]  And if I say one word slightly out, they say, he's cognitively impaired.
[00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:25.192]  Whereas Biden can run into walls.
[00:47:27.074 --> 00:47:28.775]  He can fall off the stage.
[00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:31.317]  He can fall up the stairs.
[00:47:31.177 --> 00:47:42.057]  He falls up.
[00:47:42.057 --> 00:47:43.057]  He can turn around.
[00:47:43.057 --> 00:47:44.057]  Listen to this.
[00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:49.710]  From 20,000 feet, a paratrooper is landing right in front of him.
[00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.852]  Everybody, all the foreign leaders, they're watching.
[00:47:53.872 --> 00:47:55.674]  And he turns around to look at a tree.
[00:47:57.815 --> 00:47:58.115]  Right?
[00:47:58.936 --> 00:47:59.336]  No.
[00:48:02.523 --> 00:48:04.103]  And then they say it was fake.
[00:48:04.284 --> 00:48:05.044]  He was fine.
[00:48:05.444 --> 00:48:07.004]  And then the press goes along with it.
[00:48:07.044 --> 00:48:07.985]  They go along with it.
[00:48:08.665 --> 00:48:11.546]  They say, isn't it terrible the way they cover him now?
[00:48:11.606 --> 00:48:12.246]  No, he's terrible.
[00:48:12.626 --> 00:48:14.887]  The worst president in history by far.
[00:48:15.447 --> 00:48:21.149]  And we have to get him out or this country is not going to survive another year.
[00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:29.091]  The corporate media was already a shadow of its former self until Biden stole the election four years ago.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:37.483]  But the corporate media's total commitment, because they're paid off, to gaslight us and promote all these lies, has destroyed them.
[00:48:38.023 --> 00:48:43.765]  They've gone from being worthless to being a negative, as if they're toxic waste.
[00:48:45.726 --> 00:48:46.847]  They are garbage.
[00:48:47.807 --> 00:48:49.047]  And they know they're garbage.
[00:48:50.308 --> 00:48:53.229]  And that's why now, more and more, you see them trying to backpedal.
[00:48:53.689 --> 00:48:54.850]  Too little, too late.
[00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:02.213]   And they thought all the censorship of their competition Would protect them as if the Streisand effect didn't matter.
[00:49:02.693 --> 00:49:05.293]  And I tell people about the Streisand effect all the time, they don't know what it is.
[00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:11.435]  I'm sure our audience does, but... The Streisand effect, I guess 15 years ago, whenever it was, pull it up.
[00:49:11.895 --> 00:49:16.116]  Barbara Streisand has this huge 20-bedroom mansion on the beach in California.
[00:49:16.656 --> 00:49:19.136]  She doesn't want people knowing she's super rich and got this.
[00:49:19.597 --> 00:49:22.397]  A local newspaper just writes an article about her expanding her mansion.
[00:49:22.757 --> 00:49:25.678]  She gets mad at the lady, attacks her, threatens her.
[00:49:26.258 --> 00:49:32.543]  And then it gets in the news and makes it even bigger, and now there's lines of cars outside to see the house she doesn't want you to look at.
[00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:34.604]  It's called the Streisand Effect.
[00:49:34.644 --> 00:49:35.785]  Guys, type in Streisand Effect.
[00:49:36.045 --> 00:49:41.109]  Wikipedia has a picture of her oceanfront mansion, which she shouldn't have built because it's supposedly going to be underwater.
[00:49:41.129 --> 00:49:41.690]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:49:43.604 --> 00:49:46.865]  So there's the Streisand effect, and that's what this is.
[00:49:46.885 --> 00:50:01.272]  And as long as they can't convince us to give up, as long as they can't convince us that they've beaten us and we keep fighting, we're promoting truth and justice and liberty and security and prosperity and common sense and logic and God and self-defense and family.
[00:50:02.112 --> 00:50:04.913]  So we just have to hold the line, not give up, and they're going to lose.
[00:50:04.933 --> 00:50:06.154]  They just keep going, hey, give up.
[00:50:06.434 --> 00:50:07.254]  Nope, not going to give up.
[00:50:07.734 --> 00:50:13.100]   Got the famous meme of It's not as famous as the Alex Jones Tip Jar or the Gay Frogs, but it's almost as famous.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.762]  It shows a little leftist goblin creature saying to Alex Jones, give up.
[00:50:19.143 --> 00:50:19.843]  And I say no.
[00:50:21.124 --> 00:50:25.626]  They even had Atlantic Monthly, literal CIA Epstein Island publication.
[00:50:25.786 --> 00:50:27.727]  That's the pedo group, literally.
[00:50:28.408 --> 00:50:30.309]  That is a pedo cult, Atlantic Monthly.
[00:50:30.949 --> 00:50:31.529]  Look into it.
[00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:39.976]   And the owner of it, Steve Jobs' wife, that's the most frequent visitor to Epstein Pedo Island, And they said Alex Jones lost everything and still won.
[00:50:40.736 --> 00:50:42.216]  I lost nothing.
[00:50:43.337 --> 00:50:43.757]  Nothing.
[00:50:44.777 --> 00:50:48.658]  Oh, a 127 acre farm in the middle of nowhere in case the world melted down.
[00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:50.739]  Never even had time to go there.
[00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:52.419]  It meant nothing to me.
[00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:55.100]  In fact, it was an honor.
[00:50:56.397 --> 00:51:02.601]  To sell my house two and a half years ago when Infowars needed the money and put all of it into this place.
[00:51:02.641 --> 00:51:05.883]  You think I bought a $2 million house because I wanted a big fancy house?
[00:51:05.943 --> 00:51:09.565]  I couldn't stand the repair bills, the upkeep, but it was a good deal.
[00:51:09.645 --> 00:51:12.507]  I sold it for $7 million in three years.
[00:51:13.947 --> 00:51:14.808]  Good business decision.
[00:51:14.848 --> 00:51:19.431]  I bought it at a key point in the market and sold it at the literal top.
[00:51:20.282 --> 00:51:24.104]  Because I had Elon Musk Realtor, who's a listener, I'm not going to say his name, he's the top realtor in Austin.
[00:51:24.564 --> 00:51:28.286]  He said, you know, I love you so much, Alex, I could buy this right now, but I want you to get it.
[00:51:28.306 --> 00:51:29.827]  I think it'll double in price in a couple of years.
[00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.868]  I said, you know what, Gary, you're right.
[00:51:32.248 --> 00:51:32.988]  I'm going to buy that.
[00:51:33.368 --> 00:51:40.252]  And then I turned around and made a $4 million profit plus and pumped it right into InfoWars.
[00:51:41.653 --> 00:51:46.239]  And if you remember when they had me in those fake trials, they'd say, you got nine million in Bitcoin, you kept it.
[00:51:46.259 --> 00:51:48.321]  And I said, well, I could have, but no, I put it all in InfoWars.
[00:51:48.641 --> 00:51:50.283]  We got you in perjury, you're going to jail.
[00:51:50.484 --> 00:51:52.927]  They do the auditing, the federal court does, all true.
[00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:58.393]  What'd you sell the $7 million house?
[00:51:58.413 --> 00:51:59.154]  What'd you do with the money?
[00:51:59.434 --> 00:52:00.436]  Put it in InfoWars?
[00:52:03.806 --> 00:52:04.426]  Of course it was true.
[00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:08.670]  It'd be okay if I kept that, but it was a pleasure.
[00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:10.691]  I'm sitting there with a couple million dollars in the bank.
[00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:11.652]  It's a backup emergency.
[00:52:12.653 --> 00:52:17.576]  Five years ago, and I say, I don't want to just sit here and get, you know, 1% interest on this as an emergency backup.
[00:52:17.956 --> 00:52:18.857]  I'm going to buy real estate.
[00:52:19.057 --> 00:52:20.178]  So I bought a piece of real estate.
[00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:23.521]  It more than doubled in profit, and I pumped it in.
[00:52:23.881 --> 00:52:26.583]  See, it was a pleasure.
[00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.071]  A pleasure.
[00:52:29.732 --> 00:52:31.193]  I'm willing to die for the truth.
[00:52:31.573 --> 00:52:34.014]  You think people taking a farm from me?
[00:52:34.634 --> 00:52:39.457]  You think me selling my house and putting it into this operation was a negative?
[00:52:39.837 --> 00:52:41.398]  I loved doing it.
[00:52:43.018 --> 00:52:45.059]  Because I'm fully in the fight.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.101]  Now that said, my back's against the wall now.
[00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:48.661]  I'm out of money.

[00:52:55.024 --> 00:52:55.985]  Now's the time to support.
[00:52:56.465 --> 00:52:57.426]  Now's the time of victory.
[00:52:58.154 --> 00:53:02.336]  Kim Dotcom has confirmed he's coming on right after this short break.
[00:53:02.356 --> 00:53:05.457]  We're going to talk about World War Three and how we stop it.
[00:53:05.857 --> 00:53:08.838]  Follow me at X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:53:09.278 --> 00:53:10.959]  Real Alex Jones, the Court of Celebrity.
[00:53:11.279 --> 00:53:20.423]  When I look at Bitcoin as a historian, I don't like it because this is money built on distrust.
[00:53:21.363 --> 00:53:24.685]  The central idea of Bitcoin is basically electronic gold.
[00:53:25.445 --> 00:53:34.311]  That we don't trust the banks, the governments, so we don't want to give them the ability to create as much money as they like.
[00:53:35.031 --> 00:53:36.692]  So we create this Bitcoin.
[00:53:37.252 --> 00:53:39.313]  It's a currency of distrust.
[00:53:39.994 --> 00:53:40.334]  Of you.
[00:53:40.354 --> 00:53:43.216]  I do think that the future belongs to electronic money.
[00:53:44.136 --> 00:53:59.390]  But what we've seen over the last centuries is that it's actually a good idea to give banks and governments the ability to create more and more money for themselves in order to build more trust within society.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:14.376]  So, I'm not sure what kind, what money would look like in 20 years or 30 years, but I hope it will be a currency of greater trust and not a currency of distrust.
[00:54:14.696 --> 00:54:18.461]  Finishing up, you all know Harari and just how full of crap he is as an economist.
[00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:20.223]  You as an economist watching him.
[00:54:21.471 --> 00:54:24.613]  So I'm watching that and I'm thinking, is this guy absolutely nuts?
[00:54:24.873 --> 00:54:26.034]  I mean, he is a smart guy.
[00:54:26.094 --> 00:54:27.975]  He's evil, but he's a smart guy.
[00:54:28.436 --> 00:54:43.085]  How could he say that printing money is going to bring trust when so much in our society right now is people can't afford to eat, they can't afford to pay their mortgage or their rent or buy food or do anything, right?
[00:54:43.285 --> 00:54:45.987]  Inflation doesn't bring trust.
[00:54:46.547 --> 00:54:48.489]  He's misusing the word trust.
[00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:53.815]  Because what he's actually saying is, hey, when we print money...
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:59.701]  We're going to be able to give you Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, handouts, stimulus.
[00:55:00.382 --> 00:55:03.643]  We'll raise the debt ceiling to keep this game perpetuated.
[00:55:04.063 --> 00:55:05.443]  We'll do all of this stuff.
[00:55:06.083 --> 00:55:09.544]  And so then the people will say, trust?
[00:55:09.624 --> 00:55:09.804]  What?
[00:55:10.104 --> 00:55:13.385]  It's like, I'll tolerate you because you're giving me free stuff.
[00:55:13.985 --> 00:55:15.146]  That's not trust.
[00:55:15.606 --> 00:55:19.607]  That's accepting their garbage because they're giving you free stuff.
[00:55:19.667 --> 00:55:22.088]  That comes with printing of money excessively.
[00:55:22.588 --> 00:55:22.748]  So.
[00:55:23.288 --> 00:55:26.449]  Misuse of the word trust because I don't think he's a dumb guy.
[00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:31.912]  I think he's evil, beyond evil, who has no respect for human life.
[00:55:32.132 --> 00:55:35.073]  They just said that we're going to continue to print money.
[00:55:35.513 --> 00:55:41.936]  We're going to continue to make people dependent on the government for all of their needs.
[00:55:42.476 --> 00:55:46.918]  Because the government wants to take the place of God in people's lives.
[00:55:47.379 --> 00:55:51.220]  And that statement, when you dissect what he said, that's what he's saying.
[00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:53.682]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:55:53.962 --> 00:55:54.442]  Check him out.
[00:55:54.502 --> 00:55:55.102]  Go on the site.
[00:55:55.543 --> 00:55:55.923]  Call him.

[00:55:56.943 --> 00:55:57.383]  Email him.
[00:55:57.423 --> 00:55:57.944]  Talk to him.
[00:55:57.964 --> 00:55:58.264]  720-605-3900.
[00:55:58.124 --> 00:56:06.924]   720-605-3900. Again, that's 720-605-3900. One of the most important calls you would
[00:56:06.924 --> 00:56:11.483]   make, obviously, and like he's been saying, get silver, it's up 40% on the year. He says
[00:56:11.483 --> 00:56:15.323]   he'll make such profits in silver, when the gold run starts, you use that profit to buy
[00:56:15.323 --> 00:56:20.604]   the gold and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big broker,
[00:56:20.604 --> 00:56:25.003]   no big company does. That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.
[00:56:25.003 --> 00:56:29.084]  KEPM.com/gold. KEPM.com/gold.
[00:56:29.084 --> 00:56:36.364]  [Spanish]
[00:56:36.618 --> 00:56:37.518]  What did he just say?
[00:56:38.679 --> 00:56:40.679]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:56:40.679 --> 00:56:46.278]  I know.
[00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:47.538]  (bell chimes)
[00:56:47.642 --> 00:56:51.143]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[00:56:51.544 --> 00:56:57.784]  Now we're telling you what's coming at Real Alex Jones on X.
[00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:21.704]  Dr. David Martin founded MCAM in 1998.
[00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.259]  MCAM was hired by the U.S.
[00:57:23.299 --> 00:57:41.995]  government to civilianize military technologies so that they can be exported in accordance to the international traffic and arms regulations and to provide a mechanism where banks could get credit for intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, and trade secrets.
[00:57:42.655 --> 00:57:48.522]  This contract allowed David Martin the ability to witness criminal preparations years before 2020.
[00:57:49.884 --> 00:57:55.130]  So my company was about civilianizing technology so that it could be exported.
[00:57:55.771 --> 00:58:00.537]  That got us into a bunch of places where we got to see biological and chemical weapons labs around the world.
[00:58:00.737 --> 00:58:09.380]  We are watching in real time as people file patents, as people get grants, as people do collaborations, as corporations get involved in illicit activities.
[00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:15.383]  In 1990, Pfizer filed the first patent on a vaccine for coronavirus.
[00:58:15.523 --> 00:58:30.230]   Going into 2000, 2001, a very interesting problem happened, and that was that Ralph Baric figured out how to modify a component of the protein associated with coronavirus And he actually made it into something that would target heart tissue.
[00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:39.699]  The whole reason for SARS 1.0 and the whole reason for the anthrax attack was to get commercial liability protections at the cost of civil liberties.
[00:58:40.539 --> 00:58:49.647]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:58.916]   The October 21, 2014 letter Directed from NIAID, that's Anthony Fauci's program, to Sherry Settle.
[00:58:59.376 --> 00:59:11.610]   Sherry Settle, at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Ralph Baric's program administrator, was told that the gain-of-function studies that he was doing We're actually subject to the gain-of-function moratorium.
[00:59:12.211 --> 00:59:16.798]  As your grant is currently funded, this pause is voluntary.
[00:59:17.218 --> 00:59:18.801]  This was published February 12, 2016.
[00:59:20.483 --> 00:59:24.029]  A key driver is the media, and the economics will follow the hype.
[00:59:25.222 --> 00:59:28.023]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[00:59:28.403 --> 00:59:32.105]  Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process.
[00:59:32.665 --> 00:59:38.408]  There is a very, very, very clear statement that says, WIV-1 is poised for human emergence.
[00:59:38.768 --> 00:59:41.069]  Alex, you want to guess what WIV-1 is in 2016?
[00:59:41.709 --> 00:59:45.250]  It's the Wuhan Institute of Virology Virus-1.
[00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:48.752]  That paper was published at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
[00:59:49.759 --> 00:59:52.401]  Not in Wuhan, China.
[00:59:52.441 --> 00:59:55.624]  And in 2018 and 2019, a very bizarre thing happened.
[00:59:55.924 --> 01:00:10.515]  The United States government reclaimed the patent from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and the Department of Health and Human Services at the National Institutes of Health took that UNC Chapel Hill patent on infectious replication defective coronavirus and reclaimed title and interest to it.
[01:00:10.755 --> 01:00:20.900]  We changed the definition of an adverse event following vaccination in 2018 and 2019 so that legally there was no adverse event.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.183]  If you got the shot and fell over dead, that was not an adverse event.
[01:00:26.903 --> 01:00:36.280]   They said on September 18, 2019, that by September 20, Of 2020, the world would accept a universal vaccine.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:44.084]  They said that there was going to be an accidental or deliberate release of a lethal respiratory pathogen.
[01:00:44.484 --> 01:00:45.665]  They knew it was deadly.
[01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:47.365]  They knew it was going to kill people.
[01:00:47.525 --> 01:00:54.469]  The motivation was, we have a commercially interested group of sociopaths who want to make money while killing people.
[01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:55.890]  That's the bottom line.
[01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.071]  This is when it stops being fun.
[01:00:58.431 --> 01:00:59.652]  This is when it gets hard.
[01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:01.433]  This is the Valley Forge.
[01:01:01.713 --> 01:01:03.794]  And we've got a long campaign in front of us.
[01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:11.019]  What I would highly advise, and I've advised this everywhere I go, get used to using cash and make sure you have a lot of it on hand.
[01:01:11.279 --> 01:01:12.480]  And where do we go after this?
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.101]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:16.921]  Start depositing goodwill all over the place.
[01:01:17.521 --> 01:01:21.362]  We actually have the ability right now to actually change our behavior.
[01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:23.983]  Start living and treating each other with decency.
[01:01:24.323 --> 01:01:31.944]  Start doing things where the community and the humanity that we actually manifest is something that people look at and go, I want more of that.
[01:01:32.704 --> 01:01:33.944]  More than I want the fear.
[01:01:34.004 --> 01:01:35.105]  More than I want the tyranny.
[01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:36.225]  More than I want the control.
[01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:42.206]  Because it turns out that the only way the globalists win is if you give in to fear.
[01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:44.793]  That is the only way they win.
[01:01:45.233 --> 01:01:45.914]  So don't worry.
[01:01:46.275 --> 01:01:47.657]  They can't take what you don't give them.
[01:01:48.177 --> 01:01:49.198]  So don't give them anything.
[01:01:49.899 --> 01:01:52.683]  We, the people, can say no.
[01:01:53.424 --> 01:01:55.807]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:01:57.316 --> 01:02:01.440]  Alright folks, Kim Dotcom is on the line, connected via audio zoom.
[01:02:01.921 --> 01:02:03.522]  We'll be talking to him in 60 seconds.
[01:02:03.562 --> 01:02:18.056]  Stay with us, follow me on X at RealAlexJones, follow him at Kim Dotcom on X. Alright, Kim Dotcom, very iconic individual, entrepreneur, innovator, gamer, artist, internet freedom fighter, and father of six, K-I-M Dotcom.
[01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:21.490]  And on axeatkim.com.
[01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:31.092]  And he joins us right now to talk about the very dark hours we're in, with the West giving massive amounts of high-tech weaponry.
[01:02:32.132 --> 01:02:42.335]  And now Stoltenberg announcing last week they're going to put F-16s in different countries so the Russians can't destroy them, and then attack Russia with the F-16s and German tornadoes.
[01:02:43.095 --> 01:02:49.438]   I mean, this is total Escalation into war according to standard war doctrine.
[01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:50.899]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:52.080]  Russia warns the U.S.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:59.026]  to brace for retaliation after Kremlin blamed Washington for missile attack that killed a bunch of kids and women and stuff at the beach.
[01:03:00.107 --> 01:03:02.770]  That is just some of the news that we've got on that front.
[01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:13.670]   You also, in Eastern Russia, Got so-called Islamists, just like the Moscow attack a few months ago, going around attacking churches and synagogues.
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:19.892]  This is exactly what Jack Posobiec six months ago predicted what was coming next with asymmetrical warfare.
[01:03:20.332 --> 01:03:22.653]  So, Kim.com, thank you for joining us.
[01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:28.795]  Been following your work for more than a decade, more than a decade, and seen all the crazy stuff you've been through.
[01:03:28.815 --> 01:03:30.716]  You're really an informative, smart guy.
[01:03:31.336 --> 01:03:35.638]  What is your view on where the world is right now on the march towards thermal nuclear war?
[01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:39.100]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.940]  I hear you great.
[01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:42.001]  Fantastic.
[01:03:42.582 --> 01:03:51.106]  So I think the best way to start this conversation is for me to explain why we are where we are right now.
[01:03:51.886 --> 01:03:59.770]  I think most people don't understand the origin of this entire conflict between the US and Russia and China.
[01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:13.466]   So in 2007, Putin gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference, and this is basically where he started talking about a multipolar world, that the U.S.
[01:04:13.506 --> 01:04:16.527]  hegemony is not the way of the future.
[01:04:16.547 --> 01:04:21.529]  And that upset the people in power in the U.S.
[01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:22.109]  very much.
[01:04:22.924 --> 01:04:43.478]  Then we had the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which was born out of this casino gambling of the banks, unregulated craziness that basically killed the global economy for a number of years.
[01:04:43.518 --> 01:04:45.359]  You guys will probably remember that.
[01:04:45.439 --> 01:04:46.580]  It was a tough time.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.882]  People couldn't go to the ATMs and pick up money.
[01:04:50.002 --> 01:04:53.085]  Banks had restrictions on how much money you could get.
[01:04:53.105 --> 01:04:55.867]  And that was a global financial crisis.
[01:04:56.667 --> 01:05:01.931]  And then Russia and China came together and said, we don't want the U.S.
[01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:07.835]  to have the stewardship of the global financial system anymore because they cannot be trusted.
[01:05:07.956 --> 01:05:10.778]  They allowed this gambling of the banks.
[01:05:10.858 --> 01:05:19.023]   They allowed for this massive Trillions of dollars lost in the global economy and they said we need to do something about that.
[01:05:19.563 --> 01:05:23.464]  And that is when in 2009 BRICS was founded.
[01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:26.425]  BRICS is the brainchild of Vladimir Putin.
[01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:27.825]  That is his idea.
[01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:40.670]   And what they are basically saying in the foundation documents is we are going to start our own Global financial system and anyone who wants to be part of it can join us.
[01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.971]  And that is how BRICS started.
[01:05:43.631 --> 01:05:49.294]  And then it became clear that BRICS is going to de-dollarize global trade.
[01:05:49.354 --> 01:05:56.398]  What that means is they are not allowing the dollar to be the reserve currency of the world anymore.
[01:05:56.759 --> 01:06:00.761]  Because that is really the power of the United States.
[01:06:01.421 --> 01:06:09.807]  As long as they can print money on the backs of other nations, they can have these kinds of deficits.
[01:06:10.027 --> 01:06:10.647]  The U.S.
[01:06:10.687 --> 01:06:25.296]  can be in a position of power because they can just print a lot of money and because they're the reserve currency that the whole world is using to trade, they are relatively safe and inflation is manageable.
[01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:36.576]   Now imagine what happens If a lot of global trade shifts away from the dollar to a pool of different currencies, and this is what we're seeing now.
[01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:44.003]  The BRICS countries are coming together and are saying we're no longer going to use the US dollar.
[01:06:44.544 --> 01:06:50.590]  Russia started it, then China chimed in, and now Saudi Arabia went along with this, also joining BRICS.
[01:06:51.611 --> 01:06:58.996]  And says we're not having a petrodollar anymore, so oil being traded in dollar, it's now going to be a pool of currencies.
[01:06:59.656 --> 01:07:05.221]  And this is the Achilles heel of the United States, because now the U.S.
[01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:17.870]  is so deeply indebted, 35 trillion in national debt, 30% of all taxes that are being collected by the U.S.
[01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:20.332]  government go into interest payments now.
[01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:27.228]  That money is not used for anything other than paying down the interest on debt.
[01:07:27.848 --> 01:07:34.754]  While the debt increases by a trillion dollars every three months, the U.S.
[01:07:34.954 --> 01:07:40.158]  is financially completely, excuse the language, fucked.
[01:07:40.899 --> 01:07:42.220]  Because all U.S.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.002]  debt combined with all U.S.
[01:07:45.222 --> 01:07:49.466]  unfunded liabilities, meaning funding that the U.S.
[01:07:49.506 --> 01:07:55.918]   has to provide in the future, It's already higher than all US assets combined.
[01:07:56.498 --> 01:08:08.342]  So that means everything that Americans own, everything that US businesses own, every piece of land, every piece of assets in the United States is valued at $207 trillion.
[01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:15.747]  But the combined debt and unfunded liability of the U.S.
[01:08:15.807 --> 01:08:18.749]  is already $316 trillion.
[01:08:19.369 --> 01:08:20.630]  It means the U.S.
[01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:23.192]  is already completely bankrupt.
[01:08:23.752 --> 01:08:32.320]   And when there is no more money printing, Based on the reserve currency status that the US has, it's going under.
[01:08:32.501 --> 01:08:35.042]  It's a complete economic collapse.
[01:08:35.662 --> 01:08:47.230]  And this is why they are fighting Russia and China in an approach to try and prevent this reserve currency shift from happening.
[01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:59.360]   I think when people understand this, they can now see that, of course, the war with Russia was completely provoked In Ukraine, they wanted this war.
[01:08:59.581 --> 01:09:06.314]  They needed this war to put pressure on Russia to back off from this plan of BRICS.
[01:09:07.162 --> 01:09:17.346]  And the same with China, the tariffs, you know, the aggressive action in Taiwan, again, trying to provoke them to go into a war with Taiwan.
[01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:23.268]  It's all about applying pressure to Russia and China and saying, back off.
[01:09:23.429 --> 01:09:24.889]  Don't do this with BRICS.
[01:09:25.129 --> 01:09:31.512]  Don't try and attack our reserve currency status.
[01:09:31.672 --> 01:09:37.949]   Once people understand that this is what this is all about, they can see where the world is heading, right?
[01:09:37.949 --> 01:09:41.389]  Because Russia and China are not going to back off.
[01:09:41.389 --> 01:09:44.428]  BRICS has been growing significantly.
[01:09:44.428 --> 01:09:48.428]   I think they now have over 90 countries that want to sign up to BRICS.
[01:09:48.428 --> 01:09:52.428]  They have more than half the world's population.
[01:09:52.558 --> 01:09:53.779]  You're doing a great job breaking this down.
[01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:56.321]  Let me just say, what you're saying is on record true.
[01:09:56.381 --> 01:09:57.242]  It's not debatable.
[01:09:57.642 --> 01:09:58.082]  It's admitted.
[01:09:58.102 --> 01:09:59.143]  So here's my big question.
[01:09:59.163 --> 01:10:00.224]  You go back into what's happening.
[01:10:00.884 --> 01:10:15.916]  Why would the West, who's not that stupid, destroy the dollar reserve currency, walk right into Putin's trap, blow up the North Stream Pipeline, start the war, do all this when I said years ago, you said years ago, this will drive people into bricks.
[01:10:17.076 --> 01:10:21.180]  But we know the globalists don't control Russia and China, so why are the globalists walking right out of the trap?
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:21.921]  Is it just humorous?
[01:10:25.302 --> 01:10:26.482]  I don't think it's hubris.
[01:10:26.562 --> 01:10:27.783]  I think they are cornered.
[01:10:28.043 --> 01:10:30.243]  I think they are without options.
[01:10:30.603 --> 01:10:33.464]  You know, they don't really know how to deal with this.
[01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:35.845]  The only thing that the U.S.
[01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:39.065]  really still has right now is its military.
[01:10:39.565 --> 01:10:44.367]  You know, that is the one powerful tool that they have to apply pressure.
[01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:46.647]  There's nothing else to stop this.
[01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:48.868]  So it's really their only option.
[01:10:50.328 --> 01:10:50.908]  Well, you're right.
[01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:51.628]  So they're cornered.
[01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:58.521]   My point is they then accelerated The world leaving the dollar beyond a multipolar world.
[01:10:58.541 --> 01:11:00.882]  It's not going to be multipolar in the BRICS.
[01:11:01.442 --> 01:11:06.764]  With the EU collapsing, the US in major decline, Canada falling apart, Australia a total tyranny.
[01:11:07.204 --> 01:11:12.285]  It's like they're a caricature of a supervillain and they're driving the whole world away from them.
[01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:19.428]  I mean, I see a video of Bill Gates on X or even on Instagram and it'll have 10,000 negative comments and I can't find one positive.
[01:11:19.468 --> 01:11:23.409]  I mean, the New World Order is really revealed and exposed right now.
[01:11:23.969 --> 01:11:27.152]  What do you think they're going to do as the tables have totally turned against them?
[01:11:30.575 --> 01:11:43.626]  My big worry is that, you know, once the realization sinks in that this is not reversible, that Russia and China are not going to back off, that the U.S.
[01:11:43.686 --> 01:11:50.252]  will go all in and say, well, then, you know, if we are going down, we're taking the world down with us.
[01:11:51.172 --> 01:12:01.502]  And that is the big danger here, because when you look at the level of escalation that is currently taking place between Russia and the United States, where the U.S.
[01:12:01.642 --> 01:12:14.094]  is delivering high-end weapons systems to Ukraine, but then not just delivering them the weapons, but also the capabilities to target targets within Russia.
[01:12:14.134 --> 01:12:23.744]   And then we had this major Blunder yesterday where, you know, ATAKIM's missiles were fired into Crimea and killed people on a beach.
[01:12:24.528 --> 01:12:30.192]  You know, and that wouldn't have been possible just by Ukraine themselves firing the rockets.
[01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:30.612]  The U.S.
[01:12:30.632 --> 01:12:33.054]  had to provide target assistance.
[01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:42.740]  They had a Global Hawk drone in the air assisting with the targeting because the Russians are jamming the GPS signal.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.163]  So it's, you know, to prevent missiles from Ukraine hitting targets in Crimea.
[01:12:48.524 --> 01:12:51.986]  And the only way they can get to their targets is by the U.S.
[01:12:52.566 --> 01:12:55.108]  Providing satellite and drone assistance.
[01:12:55.148 --> 01:13:02.754]  So they are basically firing the rockets and doing all the target profiling and everything.
[01:13:03.235 --> 01:13:04.496]  So that means the U.S.
[01:13:04.516 --> 01:13:09.119]  has now entered already basically directly into a war with Russia.
[01:13:09.139 --> 01:13:10.621]  It's a declaration of war.
[01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.842]  This is not the Ukrainians doing it.
[01:13:12.903 --> 01:13:13.803]  It's the U.S.
[01:13:14.304 --> 01:13:16.766]  firing these missiles, targeting these missiles.
[01:13:17.466 --> 01:13:23.932]   And Ukraine is basically just sitting there as a proxy saying, yeah, well, you know, We need to fight back.
[01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.736]  Kim Dotcom, you've stated this perfectly.
[01:13:26.756 --> 01:13:31.862]  The West has been hijacked by crazy bankers and BlackRock.
[01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:37.359]  They think they're insulated because they're not officially making the decisions, but they are in charge of policy.
[01:13:37.819 --> 01:13:40.341]  They've tried to lure Russia for 10 years into response.
[01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:41.641]  Russia finally responded.
[01:13:41.681 --> 01:13:42.401]  Russia has won.
[01:13:43.162 --> 01:13:51.846]  And so now they're trying to push Russia into a full frontal confrontation for World War III as the answer to the West losing its hegemonic control.
[01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:53.646]  Do you agree with that or not?
[01:13:53.727 --> 01:13:56.588]  And then what's the timeline here and how do we stop this?
[01:13:58.823 --> 01:14:07.586]  Well, the things, and this is also very important to understand, the West, you know, the European nations, they are acting completely irrational.
[01:14:08.206 --> 01:14:11.307]  And Europeans are looking at this and are saying, why are you doing this?
[01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:13.208]  Why are you allowing the U.S.
[01:14:13.528 --> 01:14:16.169]  to bomb Nord Stream?
[01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:18.049]  Why are you allowing the U.S.
[01:14:18.089 --> 01:14:20.190]  to hurt the European economy?
[01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:25.252]  Why is the inflation allowed to be exported from the U.S.
[01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:25.832]  to Europe?
[01:14:26.392 --> 01:14:40.380]  And it's because this whole web of debt, international debt, is so intertwined in the West, where they are basically lending each other money and their whole system is based on this U.S.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.121]  debt money printing system.
[01:14:42.741 --> 01:14:44.502]  So when the U.S.
[01:14:44.602 --> 01:14:49.114]   collapses, And they are all aware of this, that this is about to happen.
[01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:52.158]  They are all going down with the U.S.
[01:14:52.178 --> 01:14:57.706]  because they all basically banked on the same debt system that the U.S.
[01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.467]  has created.
[01:14:58.487 --> 01:15:02.993]  And when that folds, they are all going down with the United States.
[01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:14.593]  I want to play a clip of Stotenberg last week saying, in his full speech, he said, we're going to put the planes in Poland and other countries so Russia won't hit them.
[01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:19.875]  Russia says, if you launch plane attacks on us from a country, they're now a target, we will hit it.
[01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:42.981]   So a direct provocation where the corporate media thinks we'll be so dumb when F-16s attack out of Poland or other countries and fire their own cruise missiles or bombs, glide bombs, that then when those planes or bases get bombed, The media will say that Russia has started World War III, and so here's Stoltenberg literally admitting all of this.
[01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:43.581]  Here it is.
[01:15:44.701 --> 01:15:54.785]  The fact that they're now delivering F-16s, of course it will create a future NATO, sorry, Ukrainian Air Force that will be NATO-interoperable.
[01:15:55.225 --> 01:16:01.547]  NATO planes, NATO pilots, NATO-trained pilots, and NATO procedures.
[01:16:02.447 --> 01:16:07.891]  So, NATO's going to war officially with Russia, but doesn't want it officially known to the public.
[01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:18.477]  And you're right, it's suicide bankers, it's Ponzi schemes coming to an end, with the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation saying last year, we're going to do bail-ins, the whole system's going down.
[01:16:18.818 --> 01:16:25.001]  So, they're so desperate, they think nuclear war is better than their financial system coming down.
[01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:25.562]  Kim Dotcom.
[01:16:27.455 --> 01:16:31.736]  Yeah, I mean, just imagine what is going to happen in the world if the U.S.
[01:16:32.056 --> 01:16:44.338]  declares bankruptcy and basically has a new massive depression and takes with it all the Western countries that are basically embedded in this U.S.
[01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:45.998]  debt system, right?
[01:16:46.438 --> 01:16:53.579]  I mean, the scenarios that are spinning around in their heads from, you know, civil war in the United States.
[01:16:53.659 --> 01:17:02.939]   I mean, imagine what happens once Americans And all of them really realize how they have been abused by the U.S.
[01:17:02.979 --> 01:17:10.341]  government, how they have gambled away the future of American families, American children.
[01:17:10.361 --> 01:17:17.982]  You know, all of these never ending wars that have cost the U.S., you know, tens of trillions.
[01:17:18.602 --> 01:17:21.243]  It's just so sad.
[01:17:21.343 --> 01:17:23.003]  People are going to get really angry.
[01:17:23.732 --> 01:17:28.476]  And I think that's what they fear, and not just in the United States, in Europe as well.
[01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:36.382]  Once this whole house of cards comes crashing down, all these people that were responsible are going to be in big trouble.
[01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:39.925]  So they are fighting for their survival right now, you know?
[01:17:42.099 --> 01:17:43.239]  Kim, I totally agree.
[01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:44.499]  This is irreversible.
[01:17:44.519 --> 01:17:47.920]  I don't think any real analyst, whether military or economic, can deny that.
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.900]  What is the timeframe?
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:53.461]  I know you're not a sage, but you're a really smart guy.
[01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:57.462]  What do you see as the timeframe currently as a guesstimation, dead reckoning?
[01:17:57.922 --> 01:18:01.442]  And then as I asked you earlier, is there a way to avert this?
[01:18:01.982 --> 01:18:03.503]  I know the collapse is inevitable.
[01:18:04.023 --> 01:18:06.383]  We don't know exactly how it'll happen or how it'll look, but it's here.
[01:18:06.903 --> 01:18:10.824]  But is there a way to avert the war card that's being played?
[01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:17.182]  Well, my estimate is that we're not going to have a lot of time.
[01:18:17.682 --> 01:18:21.805]  I think this may even happen before the November election.
[01:18:21.825 --> 01:18:29.532]  It really looks very bad right now because BRICS is expanding faster than anybody thought.
[01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.951]  The de-dollarization is taking place right now.
[01:18:32.951 --> 01:18:41.061]   And Trump has just a couple days ago given an interview admitting this and saying this is basically a war against
[01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:42.072]  our currency.
[01:18:42.072 --> 01:18:46.231]   And it's more destructive than anything we have ever experienced.
[01:18:46.231 --> 01:18:49.751]  And he's right. That is the crux of the issue.
[01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:54.016]  I was just telling the crew while you were talking, find the clip of Trump saying, the crash is coming.
[01:18:54.036 --> 01:18:56.198]  I just hope it doesn't happen before I get in.
[01:18:56.538 --> 01:18:57.819]  I'll be blamed like Herbert Hoover.
[01:18:57.839 --> 01:18:59.060]  He wasn't calling for a collapse.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.341]  He says it's happening.
[01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:03.303]  He's hoping it happens before so he can try to fix it later.
[01:19:04.644 --> 01:19:04.844]  Yeah.
[01:19:05.344 --> 01:19:08.867]  So here's the big thing that I want everyone to understand.
[01:19:10.194 --> 01:19:13.537]  No matter who's going to be the next U.S.
[01:19:13.617 --> 01:19:16.440]  President, there's no fixing this, right?
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:31.955]  The only thing that we can hope for is that someone comes in who is honest about this and who is a crisis manager who can come in and kind of make the fall not as bad as it needs to be.
[01:19:32.495 --> 01:19:36.777]  Because there is still, you know, capital in the United States.
[01:19:36.817 --> 01:19:39.098]  There are smart people, there are smart businesses.
[01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.659]  There's a chance to recover from this.
[01:19:42.079 --> 01:19:45.480]  Yes, there will be a decade or two decades of struggle.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:51.243]  You know, the situation in the United States will never be as good as it has been.
[01:19:51.943 --> 01:19:53.884]  But you can come out of this.
[01:19:54.631 --> 01:20:02.481]  But only with a leader who is honest about what's coming and who can, you know, crisis manage the situation.
[01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:04.403]  Like Churchill did at the start of World War II.
[01:20:04.423 --> 01:20:07.787]  He said, all I'm promising you is a lot of pain and toil, but it's better than being slaves.
[01:20:09.449 --> 01:20:09.670]  Yeah.
[01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:18.735]   And right now, when you look at the political landscape, There is not a single candidate that is honest about this and that has a plan for this.
[01:20:19.296 --> 01:20:22.539]  The Americans need to be prepared for what's coming.
[01:20:22.899 --> 01:20:25.602]  There's no need to blow up the whole world.
[01:20:25.982 --> 01:20:29.486]  It's not the end of the world if there is a bankruptcy.
[01:20:29.566 --> 01:20:31.728]  People go through bankruptcies all the time.
[01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:35.989]  You know, and they can recover and they come back bigger and stronger.
[01:20:36.009 --> 01:20:36.969]  The U.S.
[01:20:37.009 --> 01:20:43.250]  has a lot of capital that it can count on for rebuilding, you know, what is broken.
[01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:44.991]  And that is the problem.
[01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:45.951]  They don't see that.
[01:20:46.011 --> 01:20:48.752]  They only see the worst case scenario.
[01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:56.713]  You know, if Russia and China win and BRICS takes over and we lose our hegemony and we lose our power, you know, it's the end of the world.
[01:20:56.913 --> 01:20:57.613]  It isn't.
[01:20:58.134 --> 01:20:59.594]  You can come back from this.
[01:21:00.762 --> 01:21:03.543]  Well, I said this three years ago with the poison shots and they rolled up.
[01:21:04.163 --> 01:21:05.984]  I said, they're gonna have a big war to cover this up.
[01:21:06.564 --> 01:21:08.084]  And that was their plan.
[01:21:08.164 --> 01:21:12.626]  And then we've got the FDIC last year saying it's going down.
[01:21:12.646 --> 01:21:14.246]  We're gonna have to grab people's bank accounts.
[01:21:14.627 --> 01:21:15.407]  Here's a clip of that.
[01:21:15.507 --> 01:21:16.727]  Kim Dotcom, I want your take on it.
[01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:17.087]  Here it is.
[01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:22.209]  I completely agree with that.
[01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:25.010]  I almost think you'd scare the public if you put this out.
[01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:26.330]  Like, why are they telling me this?
[01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:27.931]  Should I be concerned about my bank?
[01:21:29.216 --> 01:21:31.957]  My insurance company doesn't tell me what they're doing with my assets.
[01:21:32.117 --> 01:21:34.939]  They just assume they're going to pay my claim.
[01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:35.559]  Right?
[01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:43.422]  I think you've got to think of the unintended consequences of taking a public that has more full faith and confidence in the banking system than maybe people in this room do.
[01:21:44.463 --> 01:21:48.685]  So there's a select crowd of people that are on the institutional side.
[01:21:49.265 --> 01:21:51.486]  And if they want to understand this, they're going to find a way to understand this.
[01:21:51.546 --> 01:21:52.906]  There's a bunch of law firms represented in this room.
[01:21:52.926 --> 01:21:55.948]  There's a bunch of people that will charge them by the hour a lot of money to explain this all to them.
[01:21:56.348 --> 01:21:57.288]  And it's fine.
[01:21:57.388 --> 01:21:58.629]  I don't have a problem with that.
[01:21:58.889 --> 01:21:59.789]  And they all have huge staffs.
[01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:05.352]  But I would be careful about the unintended consequences of starting to blast too much of this out in the general public.
[01:22:06.272 --> 01:22:11.574]  So, Kim, you talk about the geopolitical situation triggering a bigger war as a smoke screen.
[01:22:12.034 --> 01:22:17.596]  They're also pre-programming race war, shibble division, so the bankers can kind of hide.
[01:22:17.676 --> 01:22:19.757]  But the globalists have been exposed.
[01:22:19.797 --> 01:22:21.138]  The general public is aware of this.
[01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:26.560]  There's got to be some point where they sue for peace and realize any angle they're going to try is not going to work.
[01:22:30.291 --> 01:22:33.914]  See, the problem is it's not the general public is aware of this.
[01:22:33.934 --> 01:22:36.776]  There's a handful of people who get it, right?
[01:22:37.757 --> 01:22:47.244]  It's people who have been, you know, studying geopolitics, understanding the financial system that is currently existent and how it all works.
[01:22:47.885 --> 01:22:56.972]  Most of the Americans are fooled by the propaganda that is fed to them by the media, especially the older generation that are still watching TV.
[01:22:57.312 --> 01:22:59.754]  They don't have a clue what's coming.
[01:23:00.415 --> 01:23:01.176]  No, I agree with you.
[01:23:01.016 --> 01:23:07.616]   you wouldn't have polling the way you have. You wouldn't elect the same idiots that have
[01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:12.256]   basically caused this problem in the first place. So the majority of Americans do not
[01:23:12.256 --> 01:23:14.615]  understand what they are facing.
[01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:20.936]   No, I agree with you. When I say awake, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, I mean, there are people
[01:23:20.936 --> 01:23:24.296]   are starting to realize there's a big financial scam going on.
[01:23:24.359 --> 01:23:29.684]  I mean, I get the general public still doesn't have one tenth of the information, but I think we're going in the right direction.
[01:23:30.664 --> 01:23:36.390]  What I'm saying is, if the globalists think a race war and war with Russia is going to cover this up, Kim Dotcom, I don't think it's going to work.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.140]  No, of course not.
[01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:42.562]  It's leading us into disaster.
[01:23:43.142 --> 01:23:56.568]  And what is worse, you know, a United States that goes bankrupt isn't a hegemon anymore, but can rebuild or a nuclear war that is going to wipe out humanity, or at least 98% of humanity.
[01:23:58.559 --> 01:24:01.041]  You know, I mean, people really need to understand this.
[01:24:01.081 --> 01:24:12.228]  There is an option other than nuclear war, and the United States and their Western partners right now are unfortunately taking us in the direction of World War III.
[01:24:13.143 --> 01:24:17.328]  K-I-M dot com, Kim dot com, and on X at Kim dot com.
[01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:23.576]  I want to come back then and talk about getting ready, all the different angles, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, the election.
[01:24:23.616 --> 01:24:24.597]  I want to just give you the floor.
[01:24:24.617 --> 01:24:26.219]  You're making some genius points.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.963]  To go wherever you want, but those are some of my questions.
[01:24:29.003 --> 01:24:29.703]  Back in a few minutes.
[01:24:30.024 --> 01:24:31.005]  Kim, thank you for joining us.
[01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:31.446]  We'll be right back.

[01:25:26.944 --> 01:25:33.910]  Kim.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:35.212 --> 01:25:37.193]  Very successful individual.
[01:25:37.494 --> 01:25:38.534]  Knows all the main players.
[01:25:39.437 --> 01:25:40.358]  Needs no introduction.
[01:25:41.138 --> 01:25:43.499]  And so I'm during the break saying, hey, what do you want to cover next?
[01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:44.460]  Your advice to Trump?
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.641]  How do we stop World War III?
[01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:47.382]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:25:47.402 --> 01:25:49.203]  What would you tell listeners to do financially?
[01:25:49.223 --> 01:25:53.485]  And he said, let's talk about Elon and let's talk about your Twitter account.
[01:25:53.505 --> 01:25:58.148]  So that's the last thing he said, literally 45 seconds ago before we went live again.
[01:25:58.168 --> 01:26:03.250]  I'm not trying to gonzo journalism, write myself into this, but that's where Kim wants to go next.
[01:26:03.891 --> 01:26:07.573]  Kim.com, give us your take on what you were just telling me during the break.
[01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:16.914]  Yeah, so basically Elon Musk is playing a major role in preventing the worst case scenario.
[01:26:17.574 --> 01:26:27.020]  If we didn't have Elon, we now wouldn't have the X platform, which is the biggest social media site in the world, to talk openly about this.
[01:26:27.581 --> 01:26:30.883]  Because as you know, all other channels are controlled.
[01:26:31.523 --> 01:26:34.644]  Big tech is completely in the hand of the U.S.
[01:26:34.804 --> 01:26:35.444]  deep state.
[01:26:36.064 --> 01:26:44.087]  You are not allowed to say whatever you want other than on X. And, you know, Elon is taking a lot of heat for that.
[01:26:44.587 --> 01:26:47.548]  He's being attacked by the Biden administration.
[01:26:47.568 --> 01:27:05.400]   They have opened, you know, a dozen different cases against Elon to again, you know, try and force him To not be a free speech platform, to accept the censorship that they want to put on everything so that they don't get exposed.
[01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:07.683]  And Elon is saying no to that.
[01:27:07.783 --> 01:27:12.328]  And that is quite a brave thing for someone to do who has so much on the line.
[01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.251]  Businesses that he's working on are under fire.
[01:27:19.432 --> 01:27:26.475]  You've seen what happened with Tesla, where a bunch of lawyers were trying to kill his compensation package.
[01:27:27.155 --> 01:27:30.436]  Elon is just outsmarting them every step of the way.
[01:27:30.456 --> 01:27:38.255]   And I really appreciate the guy because he is putting everything that he's built on the line for humanity.
[01:27:38.255 --> 01:27:46.456]   That we have a chance to get around this worst case scenario of a nuclear war and nuclear annihilation.
[01:27:46.456 --> 01:27:50.256]   And quantify that because he's all in. I mean he is definitely the maverick.
[01:27:50.256 --> 01:27:54.256]   I mean he's done a lot of other maverick moves but this is uber maverick stuff.
[01:27:54.256 --> 01:27:56.256]  Yeah totally.
[01:27:56.730 --> 01:28:00.332]  He is the real Iron Man.
[01:28:00.352 --> 01:28:02.614]  He is the real deal.
[01:28:02.954 --> 01:28:08.859]  Without him, I wouldn't be able to educate the world about what I know.
[01:28:08.939 --> 01:28:13.342]  Without him, most of these discussions wouldn't be possible right now.
[01:28:13.382 --> 01:28:16.184]  You know how Twitter was before he took over.
[01:28:16.744 --> 01:28:19.487]  It was a censorship bonanza, right?
[01:28:19.948 --> 01:28:36.984]   And then he came out with the Twitter files, he gave journalists access to all the back-end dealings that were going on between the US authorities and Twitter management to Stifle any kind of information coming out that they don't like.
[01:28:37.404 --> 01:28:38.945]  Because they are desperate, you know.
[01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:42.208]  They are really in a difficult spot.
[01:28:42.288 --> 01:28:46.371]  The world is crashing down on the United States.
[01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:46.971]  I'm totally agree.
[01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:54.077]  So quantify, Kim Dotcom, when you say he's trying to stop the worst-case scenario and have a soft landing, quantify that.
[01:28:56.538 --> 01:28:59.461]  Well, I mean, we're looking at World War III, literally.
[01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:01.162]  We're looking at nuclear war.
[01:29:01.992 --> 01:29:03.173]  And he understands it.
[01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:07.034]  You know, he didn't understand it right from the get-go.
[01:29:07.514 --> 01:29:11.496]  And I've spent a bit of time, you know, helping him understand.
[01:29:11.576 --> 01:29:16.818]  There are a lot of other people who helped him understand, but he is totally in our corner now.
[01:29:16.878 --> 01:29:18.519]  He's totally in the corner of humanity.
[01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:20.040]  He gets it, you know.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:21.681]  Does he get 100% of it?
[01:29:21.761 --> 01:29:28.243]  No, but he is really on the way to getting complete enlightenment about what's happening in the world.
[01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:34.005]   And he decided I will use my power to try and prevent this.
[01:29:34.546 --> 01:29:39.707]  And that's, you know, he is literally the most valuable human in the world right now.
[01:29:39.727 --> 01:29:41.108]  I agree.
[01:29:41.128 --> 01:29:42.468]  He's doing more than Trump right now.
[01:29:42.648 --> 01:29:43.549]  And Trump's a second.
[01:29:43.909 --> 01:29:47.710]  So you wanted me to ask you about my Twitter account, my ex account.
[01:29:50.573 --> 01:29:52.394]  I helped you get your Twitter account back.
[01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:54.596]  I told Elon to give it back to you.
[01:29:55.297 --> 01:30:00.161]  And he didn't like you very much because of the school shooting story.
[01:30:00.481 --> 01:30:03.744]  He was quite offended by that.
[01:30:04.224 --> 01:30:07.007]  But I told him, look, this guy apologized.
[01:30:07.768 --> 01:30:10.009]  You know, he's had this court case.
[01:30:10.909 --> 01:30:13.770]  It is dealt with, like, let this be in the past.
[01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:20.333]  And we need voices like him now to be on X. And he agreed and he gave you your account back.
[01:30:21.653 --> 01:30:22.213]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:30:22.233 --> 01:30:23.334]  Same with Scott Ritter.
[01:30:24.374 --> 01:30:30.196]  Same with Scott Ritter, you know, the guy who's out there educating Americans about the U.S.
[01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:30.917]  proxy war.
[01:30:32.197 --> 01:30:34.398]  I basically begged Elon to let him back on.
[01:30:35.589 --> 01:30:39.313]  Well, I love him exposing the extinctionist movement, the Global Sea Population Plan.
[01:30:39.953 --> 01:30:50.744]  Kim Dotcom, your view on the brain trust of the globalists, of the Western establishment, clearly transhumanist, clearly eugenicist, I might put words to your mouth, what makes them tick?
[01:30:51.124 --> 01:30:52.125]  What is their ideology?
[01:30:54.588 --> 01:30:55.769]  I think they're all just scared.
[01:30:56.129 --> 01:30:57.931]  You know, they're worried about what's coming.
[01:30:58.658 --> 01:31:03.779]  Because they know if the US government crashes, they're all going down with it.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:13.562]  And they are fearful of a future where a multipolar order emerges and they are becoming the new strongest force in the world.
[01:31:14.122 --> 01:31:24.713]   And the problem is when you are a bully, And you have been going around the world, you know, killing people, and you are suddenly in a position where you're not that strong anymore.
[01:31:25.173 --> 01:31:27.155]  You have to fear their revenge.
[01:31:27.356 --> 01:31:28.177]  You know, the U.S.
[01:31:28.217 --> 01:31:34.885]  government has killed over 20 million people and 37 victim nations since World War II.
[01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:40.194]  All these countries that have been affected by, you know, U.S.
[01:31:40.234 --> 01:31:41.836]  sanctions, U.S.
[01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:46.781]  aggression, they are no longer going to be under the thumb of the U.S.
[01:31:46.821 --> 01:31:47.302]  and the West.
[01:31:47.342 --> 01:31:48.463]  No, no, I totally agree with you.
[01:31:48.984 --> 01:31:49.604]  I totally agree with you.
[01:31:49.624 --> 01:31:51.907]  Finish your point, then I'm going to ask you this question.
[01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:56.905]  What was the COVID thing about, and the martial law, and the poison shots?
[01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:59.087]  Like, that totally discredits them.
[01:31:59.107 --> 01:32:06.654]  That's hurt the West, and Pfizer, and the UN, and Bill Gates, and Klaus Schwab more than anything.
[01:32:06.734 --> 01:32:07.695]  What were they thinking there?
[01:32:10.837 --> 01:32:12.678]  That is still a bit of a puzzle to me.
[01:32:12.738 --> 01:32:14.699]  What we do know is that U.S.
[01:32:14.759 --> 01:32:20.882]  scientists created this virus, that it was created with U.S.
[01:32:20.922 --> 01:32:25.824]  government funding, that they used a Chinese lab because under the U.N.
[01:32:25.964 --> 01:32:27.945]  bioweapon treaty, the U.S.
[01:32:28.005 --> 01:32:34.969]  is not allowed to do this kind of research in the United States, so they basically picked a jurisdiction where they could do this.
[01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.131]  How did the virus get out?
[01:32:38.571 --> 01:32:39.792]  Was it an accident?
[01:32:39.892 --> 01:32:41.433]  Was it purposely leaked?
[01:32:41.953 --> 01:32:42.593]  I don't know.
[01:32:43.093 --> 01:32:50.498]  But when you look at the craziness that is happening around the world, it is a real possibility that this was leaked on purpose.
[01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:54.220]  But I haven't seen any evidence of that.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.603]  And I don't want to go so far to suggest that this was done on purpose.
[01:32:58.643 --> 01:33:04.526]   Because if it was done on purpose, This is the biggest crime against humanity ever.
[01:33:04.586 --> 01:33:06.367]  This is bigger than any Holocaust.
[01:33:06.687 --> 01:33:08.488]  This is bigger than any war crime.
[01:33:09.069 --> 01:33:12.451]  Millions of people died around the world because of this.
[01:33:12.851 --> 01:33:14.232]  And it's all US-based.
[01:33:14.252 --> 01:33:17.654]  The United States is fully responsible for this.
[01:33:18.094 --> 01:33:20.936]  And this is what I don't like about Donald Trump, for example.
[01:33:21.776 --> 01:33:24.717]  Even in his recent interview, he is blaming China.
[01:33:24.777 --> 01:33:26.237]  He's calling it the China virus.
[01:33:26.597 --> 01:33:28.198]  China has nothing to do with this.
[01:33:28.638 --> 01:33:31.679]  You know, China was... It came out of Chapel Hill.
[01:33:31.759 --> 01:33:34.979]  It's in the Senate hearings that it was an Obama project.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:42.161]  Now, Obama is a terrible, terrible negative for the world.
[01:33:42.621 --> 01:33:48.383]  Everything that he has done... Well, give us your view on Obama, and then let's talk about how he stopped World War III, or what the soft landing looked like, please.
[01:33:50.259 --> 01:34:05.262]  Well, Obama, for example, some people may remember there was a story where his plane was stopped in Russia and he was sitting on a private jet, on a US private jet as a senator on the airfield waiting for three hours to get permission to leave.
[01:34:05.843 --> 01:34:20.380]  The reason they didn't let him leave is because the Russians knew that he has some kind of plan to go to Ukraine to sign a deal for biolabs where they are doing pathogen research and bioweapon research.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:30.246]  So they were hoping to get on the plane to get access to, you know, whatever documents they have with them because they wanted to understand more about what's going on.
[01:34:30.586 --> 01:34:39.131]  And then right after that, Obama flew to Ukraine and basically sealed the deal, a partnership between the U.S.
[01:34:39.171 --> 01:34:49.997]  government and the Ukrainian government to have biolabs in Ukraine to basically build the same kind of gain-of-function weapons that they have created in China.
[01:34:50.297 --> 01:34:50.838]  And that's right.
[01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.461]  And at first they denied it.
[01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:55.266]  Victoria Nuland got asked about it in the Senate last year.
[01:34:55.286 --> 01:34:56.969]  She said, no, it's true.
[01:34:57.069 --> 01:35:00.274]  And it was Senator Obama, you're right, that went and did the deal.
[01:35:00.314 --> 01:35:02.658]  Then he gave a press conference back in D.C.
[01:35:02.758 --> 01:35:03.580]  bragging about it.
[01:35:06.019 --> 01:35:09.381]  Yeah, I mean, all the evidence is there.
[01:35:09.862 --> 01:35:12.503]  You have to just put it all together and make sense of it.
[01:35:13.264 --> 01:35:16.266]  It's unfortunate, you know, that the U.S.
[01:35:16.306 --> 01:35:27.193]  decided to outsource this kind of bioweapon research because they were scared of doing it in the United States because that's against international law and the treaties that they have signed.
[01:35:27.714 --> 01:35:30.736]  But it's the same thing with international spying, right?
[01:35:31.236 --> 01:35:31.736]  The U.S.
[01:35:31.796 --> 01:35:35.559]  is not, under law, allowed to spy against Americans.
[01:35:36.099 --> 01:35:37.321]  So what did Obama do?
[01:35:37.341 --> 01:35:47.894]  He outsourced the spying against Americans to the British spy agencies and had the NSA hand over access to all US networks.
[01:35:48.315 --> 01:35:53.722]  The British are then spying on all Americans, putting it all in a shared spy cloud.
[01:35:54.222 --> 01:35:56.263]  Which is the Five Eyes spy cloud.
[01:35:56.703 --> 01:35:58.923]  And then through that mechanism, the U.S.
[01:35:59.103 --> 01:36:02.984]  has access to all the private communications of Americans.
[01:36:03.364 --> 01:36:07.285]  This is the kind of shady stuff that Obama has been doing.
[01:36:07.765 --> 01:36:09.186]  Talk about Putin.
[01:36:09.246 --> 01:36:11.086]  I mean, the West tries to spin him.
[01:36:11.106 --> 01:36:14.047]  David, he's wildly popular, 80 plus percent.
[01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:17.288]  I see him as a moderate force.
[01:36:17.368 --> 01:36:22.189]  If they were able to kill Putin, wouldn't we get somebody way more aggressive?
[01:36:24.508 --> 01:36:26.329]  Yeah, and that's the big risk.
[01:36:26.409 --> 01:36:32.752]  I think Putin has been very restrained in his actions in Ukraine as well as around the world.
[01:36:33.432 --> 01:36:42.616]  The way he has handled this war shows that he is really the only mature leader in this game, you know, because he could have already escalated this.
[01:36:42.676 --> 01:36:44.036]  There are so many reasons.
[01:36:44.096 --> 01:36:50.286]   I mean, just the latest attack, against the civilians in Crimea are enough to start World
[01:36:50.286 --> 01:36:50.856]  War III.
[01:36:50.856 --> 01:36:56.856]   But he is restrained, he is looking at the situation, he understands exactly
[01:36:56.856 --> 01:37:02.497]   everything that I've been explaining. He doesn't want it to come to this.
[01:37:02.497 --> 01:37:12.497]   He wants the US to accept the reality of the situation and basically let the multipolar order take over.
[01:37:12.512 --> 01:37:16.776]  But the fear is that the United States is never going to accept this reality.
[01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:21.158]  And now we see attack ballistic missiles raining down on Russian targets.
[01:37:21.638 --> 01:37:24.300]  We see Stoltenberg out of NATO saying we're going to use F-16s.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.061]  Clearly it's not debatable.
[01:37:26.101 --> 01:37:30.084]  They're trying to force Russia into an escalation.
[01:37:30.505 --> 01:37:32.626]  Then Putin gets attacked for not escalating more.
[01:37:32.666 --> 01:37:34.508]  For those that don't know, the Russians want more war.
[01:37:35.388 --> 01:37:37.130]  Napoleon went to be defeated in Russia.
[01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:38.491]  Hitler went to be defeated in Russia.
[01:37:38.971 --> 01:37:43.014]  Why do you think things keep repeating with the death of Western empires in Russia?
[01:37:45.353 --> 01:37:48.935]  They're just trying to put on as much pressure as they can.
[01:37:49.515 --> 01:37:52.117]  They almost want to be seen as lunatics.
[01:37:52.197 --> 01:37:56.840]  They want to tell Putin, look, we're crazy enough to go to World War Three.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:03.623]  You know, if you don't back down with your BRICS plans, we're going to go all the way.
[01:38:03.904 --> 01:38:06.185]  This is the message that they are sending to Putin.
[01:38:06.605 --> 01:38:19.076]  Now, Putin, of course, hopes that they're just bluffing, and no one should be crazy enough to blow up the whole world, you know, just because they're going to go through some financial turmoil, right?
[01:38:19.096 --> 01:38:21.217]  But this is where we are.
[01:38:21.237 --> 01:38:31.466]  This is how crazy it has become that they are trying to force Russia and China to abandon their BRICS multipolar order plans.
[01:38:32.438 --> 01:38:33.419]  By all means.
[01:38:33.879 --> 01:38:34.339]  Absolutely.
[01:38:34.359 --> 01:38:43.183]  And the problem is if there's a miscalculation, if they are going too far, that things can really escalate to the point of no return.
[01:38:44.504 --> 01:38:49.466]  And then we see Zuckerberg building a giant 10-story deep tomb.
[01:38:50.027 --> 01:38:52.048]  We see all these other billionaires building bunkers.
[01:38:52.908 --> 01:38:54.109]  Those aren't going to save them.
[01:38:54.269 --> 01:38:55.929]  Why don't they promote a free open society?
[01:38:55.949 --> 01:38:56.930]  That's the real protection.
[01:38:59.053 --> 01:39:00.073]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:39:00.293 --> 01:39:03.974]  You know, why would you want to live in a bunker for at least a decade?
[01:39:04.014 --> 01:39:07.715]  This is how long it takes for the nuclear winter to pass.
[01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:13.077]  And by the way, where they are building those bunkers, they're not going to survive in Hawaii.
[01:39:13.457 --> 01:39:16.098]  You know, the entire northern hemisphere will be gone.
[01:39:16.138 --> 01:39:24.320]  We'll have minus 40 degrees centigrade in the northern hemisphere after a nuclear war.
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.423]  You know, there will be no survival in those areas.
[01:39:28.824 --> 01:39:40.394]  If you want to survive World War III, you have to go to the southern tip of the southern hemisphere, you know, be either at the bottom of New Zealand or Chile, and then you may have a chance.
[01:39:41.573 --> 01:39:45.536]  Yeah, I've had dinner with Bilderberg group members in the last few years, and they said the same thing.
[01:39:46.296 --> 01:39:47.817]  That this is unsurvivable.
[01:39:47.837 --> 01:39:49.018]  This is totally insane.
[01:39:49.438 --> 01:39:53.341]  And even if the winter didn't kill you, everyone in Kauai hates Zuckerberg.
[01:39:53.741 --> 01:39:56.503]  When they're all starving to death, the first place they're going is his bunker.
[01:40:00.765 --> 01:40:05.989]  Yeah, now everybody knows he's building a bunker, so it's kind of nowhere to go, right?
[01:40:07.297 --> 01:40:08.678]  We've got 13 minutes left.
[01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:09.519]  You've been very gracious.
[01:40:09.539 --> 01:40:10.780]  You're going to come back in the next few weeks.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.421]  I know it's very early in the morning.
[01:40:12.761 --> 01:40:16.264]  We'll tape in the afternoon in the next few weeks so you don't have to, you know, get up at 6 a.m.
[01:40:16.304 --> 01:40:16.884]  or 5 a.m.
[01:40:17.304 --> 01:40:19.526]  at Kim.com, you know, here with us.
[01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:22.768]  But in closing, in the 12 minutes we have left, I'm not going to ask you more questions.
[01:40:22.788 --> 01:40:26.911]  You're giving us a lot of dead-on knowledge from our own research, very articulately said.
[01:40:26.931 --> 01:40:30.134]  You've got the floor for the last 12 minutes.
[01:40:30.154 --> 01:40:30.414]  Go ahead.
[01:40:33.332 --> 01:40:36.294]  Well, I wouldn't even know where to start, what to talk about.
[01:40:37.554 --> 01:40:39.235]  What are you personally interested in?
[01:40:39.255 --> 01:40:40.456]  Is there anything that you want to know?
[01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:41.676]  Oh, I've got a hundred questions.
[01:40:41.776 --> 01:40:43.597]  I mean, I'm trying to stop World War III.
[01:40:43.697 --> 01:40:48.660]  I know we're in the greatest danger in human history, and I'm just completely freaked out by it.
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.581]  And I see the West, as any dying empire, starting more wars.
[01:40:53.062 --> 01:40:54.702]  And I'm just, I mean, how do we reverse this?
[01:40:55.203 --> 01:40:56.163]  What is a soft landing?
[01:40:56.203 --> 01:40:59.952]   You keep talking about, you know, Trump wants a soft landing.
[01:41:00.052 --> 01:41:01.293]  Elon wants a soft landing.
[01:41:01.333 --> 01:41:02.313]  You want a soft landing.
[01:41:03.554 --> 01:41:05.834]  What is the best case scenario here?
[01:41:07.535 --> 01:41:22.800]  The best case scenario is for whoever is the next president to bring the brightest minds in the world together in a big conference and try and figure out how can we get out of this with minimal damage.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.380]  And be honest about the derivatives.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.641]  Be honest about all of it.
[01:41:25.661 --> 01:41:26.421]  You've got to be honest.
[01:41:27.885 --> 01:41:30.066]  The whole thing is going to come crashing down.
[01:41:30.126 --> 01:41:32.447]  There's no fixing that, right?
[01:41:32.827 --> 01:41:35.368]  But how are we going to come out of it?
[01:41:35.828 --> 01:41:40.889]  What are our strategies, you know, to move forward after that?
[01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:45.011]  I think, you know, once there's some honesty here by the U.S.
[01:41:45.051 --> 01:41:56.875]  government and Americans really understand that tough times are coming, the great thing that you have is that people are going to unite and work together to come out of this.
[01:41:57.515 --> 01:42:15.246]  Right and there is a way out you know you don't need to be the hegemon gorilla alpha in the world and dictate all the rules you know you can just focus on your country and you know rebuild and come out of this stronger.
[01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:18.685]  The problem is no one is looking at it this way.
[01:42:18.705 --> 01:42:31.183]  They're so arrogant and in such a hubris that they think they can force the rest of the world to just go on with the same broken system that has existed.
[01:42:32.094 --> 01:42:33.255]  And that's not going to happen.
[01:42:33.736 --> 01:42:45.709]  So once you realize that, the next best thing you can do is bring the brightest minds, people like Elon, you know, bring the brightest minds together to think about how are we going to get out of this.
[01:42:48.129 --> 01:42:49.170]  I totally agree with you.
[01:42:49.190 --> 01:42:52.191]  Again, we're not talking about speculation here.
[01:42:52.211 --> 01:42:54.112]  We're talking about the reality.
[01:42:54.172 --> 01:42:57.714]  Instead, I look at the globalists and they're saying there's going to be a race war.
[01:42:58.054 --> 01:43:02.796]  So they want to start a war with Russia and then divide America so we don't get together and fix things.
[01:43:03.557 --> 01:43:05.538]  That's the most dangerous scenario for the elite.
[01:43:05.558 --> 01:43:08.119]  So they are literally building their own tomb.
[01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:19.606]  They're doing everything wrong and how it is not appearing to them that they're doing everything wrong when things are going so abysmal for them.
[01:43:20.186 --> 01:43:23.668]  You know, I mean, just look at the situation in the world.
[01:43:24.208 --> 01:43:31.491]  All the strategies that they have applied, all the think tanks that they have used to try and figure this out were all wrong.
[01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:32.652]  It's not working.
[01:43:33.323 --> 01:43:33.543]  Right.
[01:43:33.583 --> 01:43:40.788]  So the best way forward is brutal honesty and transparency with the American people.
[01:43:40.848 --> 01:43:44.030]  Let them know exactly what they have to expect.
[01:43:44.590 --> 01:44:04.942]   You know, apologize for the decades of mismanagement and the terrible financial situation that they have created and especially the lobby class, you know, that has bought politicians so that they can profit At the expense of the nation and Americans.
[01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:06.703]  That is really what happened here.
[01:44:06.923 --> 01:44:09.045]  That corruption needs to stop.
[01:44:09.385 --> 01:44:22.092]  There need to be new laws enacted where no corporate donations can go to politicians, where corporations don't have a say in any of the political decisions that are being made.
[01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:27.995]  It needs to be going back to a system that works for the people and not for shareholders.
[01:44:28.575 --> 01:44:30.136]  That is the biggest problem.
[01:44:31.537 --> 01:44:33.379]  Back to Trump, because we should criticize Trump.
[01:44:33.419 --> 01:44:35.201]  They don't like him because he wants to be president.
[01:44:35.462 --> 01:44:39.086]  Well, let me ask you, why don't they like President Trump?
[01:44:39.186 --> 01:44:44.112]  And then let's talk about, because I interrupted you earlier, why he won't admit Warp Speed was a lie.
[01:44:44.512 --> 01:44:45.433]  We know how he got set up.
[01:44:45.553 --> 01:44:49.518]  Why he pick-headedly keeps going along with it, because that's the biggest strike against Trump.
[01:44:51.403 --> 01:45:00.790]  You know, I played a role in trying to get Trump elected, you know, all the shit that happened with Hillary, you know, prior to the election that he won.
[01:45:00.810 --> 01:45:11.277]  I was part of that, you know, in trying to expose who she really is, what the Democrats are really doing, you know, and I was hopeful that he's going to turn things around.
[01:45:11.317 --> 01:45:14.499]  But I have to tell you, quite honestly, I'm very disappointed with him.
[01:45:15.071 --> 01:45:19.893]  You know, I think he let down his promise of draining the swamp.
[01:45:19.933 --> 01:45:25.896]  I think he hasn't done enough to try and completely reform the United States.
[01:45:25.996 --> 01:45:28.377]  He has appointed a lot of bad people.
[01:45:28.397 --> 01:45:30.878]  You know, he's trusted a lot of bad people.
[01:45:30.918 --> 01:45:33.419]  It has backfired for him and for Americans.
[01:45:34.079 --> 01:45:41.062]   And, you know, if he should get back in, He needs to have a complete change of attitude.
[01:45:41.082 --> 01:45:49.546]  He needs to surround himself with people that he can really trust, that have a joint goal to fixing America.
[01:45:49.846 --> 01:45:52.667]  He needs to understand that he will be a crisis president.
[01:45:53.231 --> 01:45:53.471]  Right.
[01:45:53.672 --> 01:45:56.735]  Yes, I understand that all of this is going to come down.
[01:45:56.755 --> 01:45:59.157]  There's no way to prevent this or stop this.
[01:45:59.598 --> 01:46:04.743]  So, you know, is he the guy who can turn America around?
[01:46:04.943 --> 01:46:05.504]  I hope so.
[01:46:05.744 --> 01:46:06.545]  You know, I hope so.
[01:46:07.045 --> 01:46:11.370]  But I think right now he doesn't have the understanding required.
[01:46:11.850 --> 01:46:28.965]  He needs help to understand what the situation really is, because he keeps talking about tariffs against China, about all the things that he wants to do to rein all the foreign countries in, so they are not doing this de-dollarization.
[01:46:28.985 --> 01:46:30.907]  That's the wrong attitude.
[01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:35.033]  The real attitude is, how are we going to fix this?
[01:46:35.754 --> 01:46:38.476]  First of all, how are we going to be completely honest about it?
[01:46:38.857 --> 01:46:40.438]  And then how are we going to fix this?
[01:46:40.798 --> 01:46:48.045]  And if we don't have a reformed president from day one who understands what the mission is, it's going to get even worse.
[01:46:48.245 --> 01:46:48.706]  That's right.
[01:46:49.547 --> 01:46:50.387]  And I would add this.
[01:46:50.447 --> 01:46:53.090]  You can look at all the economics and the cultural angles.
[01:46:54.221 --> 01:46:56.462]  You don't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[01:46:56.482 --> 01:47:01.625]  And Americans have paid for these wars and this globalist corporate empire.
[01:47:01.945 --> 01:47:04.106]  It's not like Americans get something out of this empire.
[01:47:04.467 --> 01:47:07.929]  The end of this evil globalist empire is good for people.
[01:47:08.509 --> 01:47:09.289]  It's good for America.
[01:47:09.349 --> 01:47:10.470]  It's good for everybody.
[01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:14.032]  So the idea they're trying to take the globalists.
[01:47:14.472 --> 01:47:17.915]  Shutting off the fertilizer in Europe, shutting off the pipelines here.
[01:47:18.396 --> 01:47:23.240]  Like, if we're the power base of the New World Order, why are they then cutting off our energy as well?
[01:47:23.741 --> 01:47:33.810]  It's so predatory that these globalists can't help but attack everybody, then blow up Nord Stream and blame the Russians, then later admit last year the Pentagon did it.
[01:47:33.851 --> 01:47:35.032]  I mean, that is just madness.
[01:47:37.494 --> 01:47:39.416]  No, really in a bad way.
[01:47:40.396 --> 01:47:48.724]  You know, and my honest opinion is that it will be very unlikely that we're going to cut the corner and get out of this.
[01:47:49.464 --> 01:47:55.409]  I've been thinking for over a year, you know, when the missiles are going to start flying.
[01:47:55.650 --> 01:48:03.617]  And right now, I would say 90% chance that this is not going to be worked out and that the world is going to have a nuclear war.
[01:48:04.642 --> 01:48:05.662]  We got one minute left.
[01:48:05.783 --> 01:48:06.283]  Speak to that.
[01:48:06.343 --> 01:48:15.927]  I agree with you that in the threat trajectory and the threat escalation ladder of the Rand Corporation and every other war game, nuclear war is a probability, not a possibility.
[01:48:17.327 --> 01:48:19.148]  Yeah, I think it's a very high chance.
[01:48:20.089 --> 01:48:23.750]  And, you know, it's unfortunate because just think about what that means.
[01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:26.691]  You know, humanity has a lot of positives.
[01:48:26.852 --> 01:48:31.068]   There are so many Artists, bright minds, beautiful things.
[01:48:31.128 --> 01:48:34.570]  Look at, you know, everything that we have invented and how far we have come.
[01:48:34.930 --> 01:48:36.330]  Why throw it all away?
[01:48:36.771 --> 01:48:45.815]  Because one nation cannot accept that they have gone the wrong path and that they have lost the hegemony that they wanted.
[01:48:46.035 --> 01:48:48.796]  You know, it's just that that's what it really boils down to.
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.920]  The U.S.
[01:48:52.081 --> 01:49:04.003]  is run by arrogant people, by selfish people who don't look at this bigger picture of humanity, how far we have come, what potential we have in the future.
[01:49:04.443 --> 01:49:10.004]  You know, if they would see that and think in that direction, you know, maybe there's a chance.
[01:49:10.064 --> 01:49:11.705]  But they're not thinking about that at all.
[01:49:12.065 --> 01:49:18.506]  They're just being selfish fools who think that with aggression they can fight their way out of this somehow.
[01:49:19.046 --> 01:49:20.146]  And it's not gonna work.
[01:49:20.367 --> 01:49:20.767]  It's not.
[01:49:22.327 --> 01:49:24.448]  Empires don't die, they commit suicide.
[01:49:24.468 --> 01:49:25.448]  And that's where we are.
[01:49:26.429 --> 01:49:32.311]  Kim.com, K-I-M.com and Kim.com on X. Kim, thank you so much for the hour.
[01:49:32.871 --> 01:49:34.631]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:37.613]  We can let you sleep a little later.
[01:49:38.353 --> 01:49:39.253]  I'll tape anytime.
[01:49:39.913 --> 01:49:41.314]  We need to stop this nuclear war.
[01:49:41.454 --> 01:49:43.394]  I agree with you, it's a probability, not a possibility.
[01:49:43.715 --> 01:49:44.515]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:49:46.055 --> 01:49:46.355]  All right.
[01:49:46.516 --> 01:49:47.117]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:47.157 --> 01:49:47.818]  Have a nice day.
[01:49:47.878 --> 01:49:48.218]  Bye-bye.
[01:49:48.238 --> 01:49:48.518]  Thank you.
[01:49:48.559 --> 01:49:49.981]  I'll say bye to you right now during the break.
[01:49:50.001 --> 01:49:51.062]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[01:49:51.082 --> 01:49:51.403]  Stay with us.
[01:49:52.083 --> 01:49:55.709]  HSBC and JP Morgan Chase.
[01:49:56.437 --> 01:49:59.239]  So, you look at what do they do?
[01:49:59.299 --> 01:50:01.701]  What are they the biggest banks in the world of?
[01:50:02.442 --> 01:50:08.907]  Those two are number one and number two largest short sellers of silver on the planet.
[01:50:09.367 --> 01:50:10.088]  Those two banks.
[01:50:10.648 --> 01:50:15.312]  And now we're starting to see a short squeeze happening in silver.
[01:50:15.752 --> 01:50:22.738]  But we had 568 million ounces of silver being shorted, naked shorts.
[01:50:23.178 --> 01:50:24.539]  Meaning they don't own the assets.
[01:50:24.919 --> 01:50:29.962]  They just put these futures contracts on them to shorts to drive the price down.
[01:50:30.383 --> 01:50:44.431]  Well, when you have a short position and the value of the underlying thing that you're shorting goes up, Alex, you lose money hand over fist in multiples, not dollar for dollar, but multiples.
[01:50:44.872 --> 01:50:58.261]   The day before Iran basically sent those drones into Israel, China made this announcement, said, hey, everybody in China, start buying silver.
[01:50:58.801 --> 01:51:00.102]  Don't just buy gold.
[01:51:00.523 --> 01:51:01.403]  Buy silver.
[01:51:01.684 --> 01:51:06.507]  You made the point that China was trying to call the naked shorts of the Western Central Banks.
[01:51:07.048 --> 01:51:09.890]  Look at what's happened to silver since that time.
[01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:11.571]  Skyrocketing!
[01:51:12.051 --> 01:51:33.529]  You've got low supply, you've got high demand, you've got a short squeeze starting where the manufacturers of the world, the defense contractors, the aerospace industry, the fuel cell technology people, the solar people, they all need silver and there's not much available because India has already committed to 66% of the world's supply this year.
[01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:36.271]  So here's where we've got this short squeeze happening.
[01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:39.254]  Physical supply coming out of inventory.
[01:51:39.714 --> 01:51:42.915]  Not available for the manufacturers to purchase.
[01:51:43.515 --> 01:51:48.697]  And what has happened to the price of silver in the last two and a half months?
[01:51:49.477 --> 01:51:55.740]  Literally, the last 75 days or so, silver's gone from 22 and a half to almost 32.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.441]  It's up like 45% in two and a half months.
[01:52:01.182 --> 01:52:07.724]  And you've got those Western banks that have millions, hundreds of trillions of ounces of silver short.
[01:52:08.544 --> 01:52:09.805]  And the price went up 45%.
[01:52:10.085 --> 01:52:12.947]  They are losing money hand over fist.
[01:52:13.347 --> 01:52:27.917]  So part of me says this kind of being on the wrong side of a price move when it's leveraged could cause HSBC and JP Morgan Chase to have a really, really, really big financial problem.
[01:52:28.257 --> 01:52:30.959]  And their CEOs are jumping ship.
[01:52:31.559 --> 01:52:32.740]  They're getting out of Dodge.
[01:52:33.301 --> 01:52:34.562]  Our firm is just different.
[01:52:34.983 --> 01:52:38.927]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[01:52:39.287 --> 01:52:45.273]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[01:52:45.694 --> 01:52:50.178]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[01:52:50.619 --> 01:52:53.582]  When you sell it back, we take nothing.
[01:52:54.262 --> 01:52:54.722]  Zero.
[01:52:55.223 --> 01:52:57.844]  And whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[01:52:58.284 --> 01:53:11.729]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even.
[01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:14.030]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.811]  Check them out.
[01:53:14.851 --> 01:53:15.431]  Go on the site.
[01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:16.272]  Call him.
[01:53:16.332 --> 01:53:17.193]  Get a consultation.
[01:53:17.293 --> 01:53:17.714]  Email him.
[01:53:17.754 --> 01:53:18.274]  Talk to him.
[01:53:18.294 --> 01:53:18.615]  720-605-3900.
[01:53:18.675 --> 01:53:19.075]  Again, that's 720-605-3900.
[01:53:19.095 --> 01:53:20.617]  One of the most important calls you would make, obviously.
[01:53:20.637 --> 01:53:22.039]  And like he's been saying, get silver.
[01:53:21.859 --> 01:53:29.298]   One of the most important calls you would make, obviously, and like he's been saying,
[01:53:29.298 --> 01:53:31.338]  get silver, up 40% on the year.
[01:53:31.338 --> 01:53:35.499]   He says he'll make such profits in silver, when the gold run starts, you use that profit
[01:53:35.499 --> 01:53:40.218]   to buy the gold and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big
[01:53:40.218 --> 01:53:42.099]  broker, no big company does.
[01:53:42.118 --> 01:53:45.100]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.

[01:53:49.623 --> 01:53:52.585]  All right, folks.
[01:53:54.287 --> 01:53:55.968]  That was an amazing interview in the last hour.
[01:53:56.963 --> 01:54:00.765]  I'm going to open the phones up on the subject of World War III, nuclear war.
[01:54:01.325 --> 01:54:02.125]  Can it be stopped?
[01:54:02.145 --> 01:54:06.047]  You heard Kim, very smart guy, say he thinks it's a 90% chance.
[01:54:06.227 --> 01:54:08.888]  I tend to think maybe 70% chance.
[01:54:08.968 --> 01:54:10.729]  I mean, I don't, I don't, it's probably right.
[01:54:11.169 --> 01:54:13.450]  I mean, on the trajectory we're on, it's 100% chance.
[01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:16.131]  So we'll give the toll free number out next segment.
[01:54:17.324 --> 01:54:17.845]  I'll give it out now.
[01:54:17.865 --> 01:54:17.905]  877-789-2539.
[01:54:17.945 --> 01:54:19.046]  First-time callers today.
[01:54:19.066 --> 01:54:19.266]  877-789-Alex.
[01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:19.406]  877-789-2539.
[01:54:19.506 --> 01:54:22.108]  On the end of the dollar, World War III.
[01:54:22.128 --> 01:54:22.749]  Can we stop it?
[01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:23.489]  Can we stop nuclear war?
[01:54:23.509 --> 01:54:23.569]  877-789-2539.
[01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:24.330]  We'll play a few clips here.
[01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:26.612]  Come back, join some stations, go to your phone call.
[01:54:26.572 --> 01:54:33.672]   9 on the end of the dollar World War 3 can we stop it can we stop nuclear war
[01:54:33.672 --> 01:54:39.171]   877 789 2539 we'll play a few clips here come back to Winston Stacey's go to
[01:54:39.171 --> 01:54:43.570]   your phone call stay with us this is crystal palace Inc.
[01:54:43.590 --> 01:54:45.111]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:54:45.151 --> 01:54:46.871]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:54:47.391 --> 01:54:49.231]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:54:50.872 --> 01:54:54.912]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[01:54:55.352 --> 01:54:56.813]  Target selection complete.
[01:54:56.873 --> 01:54:58.753]  Time on target sequence complete.
[01:54:59.533 --> 01:55:05.634]  22 Type I class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[01:55:05.834 --> 01:55:10.415]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:14.912]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[01:55:15.773 --> 01:55:18.134]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:55:18.194 --> 01:55:19.575]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:55:19.815 --> 01:55:24.238]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:55:24.258 --> 01:55:24.919]  You bet!
[01:55:25.399 --> 01:55:29.542]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:55:29.702 --> 01:55:32.644]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:55:32.664 --> 01:55:36.526]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:55:36.546 --> 01:55:40.028]  Shall we play a game?
[01:55:40.007 --> 01:55:46.007]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[01:55:46.007 --> 01:55:51.007]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:55:50.985 --> 01:55:52.948]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:55:53.248 --> 01:55:54.090]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:55:54.831 --> 01:55:56.032]  We are at a launch mode.
[01:55:56.453 --> 01:55:57.675]  Do you really believe?
[01:55:59.364 --> 01:55:59.985]  Provocation.
[01:56:00.365 --> 01:56:04.289]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:56:04.749 --> 01:56:05.150]  We're in!
[01:56:06.251 --> 01:56:07.552]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:56:08.012 --> 01:56:10.615]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[01:56:10.635 --> 01:56:12.176]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:56:12.617 --> 01:56:14.058]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.906]  The only way to win is not to play.
[01:56:21.726 --> 01:56:38.046]  We're playing now though.
[01:56:38.093 --> 01:56:45.738]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:56:46.018 --> 01:56:48.120]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:53.722]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:56:54.282 --> 01:56:59.644]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:56:59.704 --> 01:57:02.805]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:57:03.085 --> 01:57:06.066]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:57:06.127 --> 01:57:08.687]  We came, we saw, we died.
[01:57:11.070 --> 01:57:13.093]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:57:13.454 --> 01:57:16.899]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:57:17.139 --> 01:57:25.051]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:57:26.946 --> 01:57:27.426]  The U.S.
[01:57:27.466 --> 01:57:31.069]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:39.036]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:57:39.436 --> 01:57:41.938]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:57:42.158 --> 01:57:45.922]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[01:57:45.942 --> 01:57:47.203]  Hillary was always planning this.
[01:57:48.063 --> 01:57:50.345]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:57:50.385 --> 01:57:52.006]  As soon as they got Biden in... Back the races.
[01:57:55.299 --> 01:57:56.540]  Folks, this ain't a joke, okay?
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:01.042]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:10.886]  The global's trying to get us all killed.
[01:58:10.926 --> 01:58:14.668]  We've never been close to a nuclear war.
[01:58:14.688 --> 01:58:15.508]  All the animals agree.
[01:58:16.889 --> 01:58:19.770]  This November 8th, vote like your life depends on it, because it does.
[01:58:21.031 --> 01:58:22.991]  They're trying to start a war before then.
[01:58:23.072 --> 01:58:30.072]  a nuclear war.
[01:58:30.072 --> 01:58:32.671]  We're taking your phone calls on World War 3.
[01:58:32.411 --> 01:58:33.152]  How do we stop it?
[01:58:33.872 --> 01:58:36.374]  Straight ahead.
[01:58:36.394 --> 01:58:37.934]  877-789-2539.
[01:58:37.954 --> 01:58:38.515]  877-789-Alex.
[01:58:39.335 --> 01:58:42.417]  Rob, Andrew, Billy, David, Travis, stay with us.
[01:58:42.717 --> 01:58:43.678]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:58:44.118 --> 01:58:45.079]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:46.279 --> 01:58:49.621]  U.S.-made missiles are raining down on Russian civilians.
[01:58:50.302 --> 01:58:55.385]  And the head of NATO says USF-16s are going to start bombing Russia in the next two weeks.
[01:58:57.031 --> 01:58:59.574]  You cannot take this news and downplay it.
[01:59:00.054 --> 01:59:02.537]  I mean, I'm sitting here pinching myself going, is this really happening?
[01:59:03.217 --> 01:59:08.623]  You follow military doctrine, you follow history, this leads to full thermal nuclear war.
[01:59:08.663 --> 01:59:12.527]  We had Kim Dotcom on, really smart guy earlier, breaking all this down.
[01:59:13.268 --> 01:59:18.193]  I want to open the phones up specifically on the subject of World War III, nuclear war, and how do we stop it.
[01:59:19.915 --> 01:59:20.796]  But look at these headlines.
[01:59:21.016 --> 01:59:23.077]  This was at the top of Drudge the last two days.
[01:59:23.317 --> 01:59:24.558]  Yahoo's top story.
[01:59:25.279 --> 01:59:27.140]  Why it's too late to stop World War III.
[01:59:28.841 --> 01:59:30.322]  They're just telling us it's the way it is.
[01:59:30.382 --> 01:59:31.203]  World War III.
[01:59:31.923 --> 01:59:33.585]  Sean Penn's like, nuclear war is good.
[01:59:33.665 --> 01:59:34.165]  It's liberal.
[01:59:35.566 --> 01:59:40.549]  Ukrainian women taking men's place on the front lines as volunteers run low and thousands flee conscription.
[01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:43.872]  Kim's fearless women include mother turned sniper.
[01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:46.390]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:59:47.070 --> 01:59:48.191]  Russia warns the U.S.
[01:59:48.231 --> 01:59:53.192]  to brace for retaliation after Kremlin blamed Washington for attack on beach.
[01:59:55.353 --> 01:59:58.993]  Russia unveils anti-drone robot named after Disney character WALL-E.
[02:00:01.234 --> 02:00:05.315]  Crimeans Sunday they're struck by deadly shrapnel shower from Ukrainian missile.
[02:00:07.476 --> 02:00:08.636]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:00:08.656 --> 02:00:15.558]   And it's all because the big globalist bubble He's coming to an end.
[02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:19.740]  Are they unifying America ahead of this?
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:20.901]  No, total division.
[02:00:21.721 --> 02:00:24.182]  The globalists think they have a plan to win.
[02:00:24.622 --> 02:00:27.623]  They think they've got us where they want us.
[02:00:28.704 --> 02:00:29.784]  They're totally delusional.
[02:00:30.845 --> 02:00:33.226]  It's like taking the keys away from somebody that's drank three bottles of vodka.
[02:00:33.906 --> 02:00:34.986]  They're gonna go run into a tree.
[02:00:37.327 --> 02:00:40.689]  Whiskey bottle, brand new car, oak tree in the way.
[02:00:42.844 --> 02:00:44.906]  Yeah, let's go out to break with, uh, ooh, that smell.
[02:00:47.368 --> 02:00:52.092]  So that's where we are right now.
[02:00:52.132 --> 02:00:53.994]  I've got big COVID poison news.
[02:00:54.054 --> 02:00:56.776]  I've got big open border, new world order news.
[02:00:57.537 --> 02:01:02.141]  I've got the media hyping regular summer temperatures is the end of the world.
[02:01:02.621 --> 02:01:04.303]  We need carbon taxes news.
[02:01:05.003 --> 02:01:13.951]   I've got a lot to cover here today, but I want to take your phone calls on The big war we're already in in Russia that could go thermonuclear very, very quick.
[02:01:15.232 --> 02:01:18.675]  So, we'll take the calls, the order that they are received.
[02:01:19.656 --> 02:01:25.321]  And I guess the first caller would be Andrew or Andre.
[02:01:25.341 --> 02:01:26.422]  My eyes are going out.
[02:01:26.442 --> 02:01:27.222]  They speak amazing.
[02:01:28.383 --> 02:01:30.065]  Andre in Massachusetts.
[02:01:30.105 --> 02:01:30.445]  Go ahead.
[02:01:32.547 --> 02:01:32.767]  Yeah.
[02:01:33.507 --> 02:01:33.748]  Go ahead.
[02:01:33.908 --> 02:01:35.009]  It's Andrea.
[02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:36.470]  Go ahead.
[02:01:37.717 --> 02:01:38.178]  Okay, hi.
[02:01:38.618 --> 02:01:40.159]  First, I'd like to plug BODYZ.
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:48.267]  I mean, I've been disabled for over 25 years and nothing relieves the inflammation without rotting my stomach out like ibuprofen.
[02:01:49.108 --> 02:01:51.190]  But this BODYZ is heaven-sent.
[02:01:51.591 --> 02:01:52.932]  I just can't live without it.
[02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:55.254]  So, thank you for that product very much.
[02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:58.858]  Okay, World War III, we were slow walking.
[02:01:59.098 --> 02:02:01.020]  We are now in a massive race.
[02:02:01.536 --> 02:02:04.918]  We're in a race to World War III, and it's biblical.
[02:02:05.199 --> 02:02:07.420]  The whole thing is fulfilling prophecy.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.985]  It's like I look out my window every day and go, okay, what chapter, what verse are we in right now in the Book of Revelations?
[02:02:14.325 --> 02:02:23.432]  Because it's all happening in real time, and living color, and... You're totally right, Andrea, and I'm sorry I got your name wrong, but this is happening.
[02:02:23.452 --> 02:02:25.033]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:02:25.073 --> 02:02:25.593]  Absolutely.
[02:02:28.335 --> 02:02:30.237]  So, what do you think the timeline is?
[02:02:31.914 --> 02:02:45.018]  Oh, I believe by, well, Agenda 2030, so I believe by June of 2026, we're halfway through the trip, and it's going to break loose all over the place.
[02:02:45.198 --> 02:02:47.158]  There's not going to be anywhere to hide, anywhere to go.
[02:02:47.178 --> 02:02:50.719]  I mean, yeah, maybe going to Chile is a good idea.
[02:02:50.739 --> 02:02:55.140]  I'm not sure, but I don't know why that is.
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.101]  Why is that?
[02:02:56.861 --> 02:03:01.182]  Well, that's because it's the Southern Hemisphere, and the radiation wouldn't really go down there as bad.
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:02.781]  Oh, is that what it is?
[02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:04.382]  Oh, great.
[02:03:04.482 --> 02:03:04.782]  Okay.
[02:03:05.903 --> 02:03:08.585]  But I just wanted to say thank you for everything you do.
[02:03:08.965 --> 02:03:09.726]  You're amazing.
[02:03:10.166 --> 02:03:10.907]  Always have been.
[02:03:11.487 --> 02:03:13.349]  And God bless you and your staff.
[02:03:14.049 --> 02:03:14.950]  And stay safe.
[02:03:15.150 --> 02:03:15.870]  Well, I appreciate you.
[02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:18.192]  Yeah, folks, she talks about the product.
[02:03:19.153 --> 02:03:20.754]  My wife plays a lot of sports.
[02:03:21.294 --> 02:03:22.055]  Tennis, you name it.
[02:03:22.736 --> 02:03:24.577]  And so her hips hurt, her elbows hurt.
[02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:26.638]  And she takes big ol' horse pill turmeric.
[02:03:26.659 --> 02:03:28.200]  And they give her a little bit of relief.
[02:03:29.043 --> 02:03:30.323]  And I told her, "Take this."
[02:03:30.323 --> 02:03:32.623]   And she's like, "Well, this is a lower milligram "than mine."
[02:03:32.623 --> 02:03:35.962]  I go, "But it's concentrate turmeric, 95% humanoid.
[02:03:35.962 --> 02:03:38.523]  "It's like taking 10 pills, literally."
[02:03:38.523 --> 02:03:40.403]  She took it and goes, "Wow, my pain's gone."
[02:03:40.403 --> 02:03:42.403]  That's how great bodies is.
[02:03:42.403 --> 02:03:47.082]   Discounted at FullRestore.com because it's the strongest turmeric on the market.
[02:03:47.082 --> 02:03:49.783]  Travis in North Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:03:49.783 --> 02:03:52.283]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:52.283 --> 02:03:53.123]  Welcome.
[02:03:53.123 --> 02:03:55.523]  Hey, long time listener.
[02:03:55.472 --> 02:03:57.074]  First time I ever got through, man.
[02:03:57.154 --> 02:04:00.517]  I really wanted to talk to you about COVID, but I'll talk to you about the Russians.
[02:04:00.537 --> 02:04:02.078]  We can talk about Russia, too.
[02:04:02.098 --> 02:04:04.620]  Talk about Russia first and give us your take on COVID.
[02:04:05.901 --> 02:04:12.867]  Okay, well, when I lived in Southwest Florida, my kids went to a private school with a bunch of Ukrainians.
[02:04:12.967 --> 02:04:17.393]   And when this war first kicked off, They were all excited the U.S.
[02:04:17.473 --> 02:04:26.500]  was backing them, and I'd go over to the church and buy stuffed cabbage from the ladies and everything on the weekends, and I told them straight out, Alex, I said, when has the U.S.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:29.582]  ever gotten involved with another country and something turned out?
[02:04:29.602 --> 02:04:32.044]  They just kind of laughed at me and this and that.
[02:04:32.084 --> 02:04:36.468]  Well, a lot of them same people now, they're in desperation.
[02:04:36.488 --> 02:04:40.250]  Their kids are getting killed over there and they don't know what to do, and I'm like, told you.
[02:04:41.752 --> 02:04:43.953]  It's like Texas taking on the rest of the U.S.
[02:04:44.013 --> 02:04:44.834]  It's never going to work.
[02:04:45.663 --> 02:04:50.104]  By the way, that sounds awesome, eating stuffed cabbage with a bunch of Ukrainian women.
[02:04:50.984 --> 02:04:52.285]  You know what?
[02:04:52.305 --> 02:04:55.525]  They may not know how to fight very well, but they make pretty good stuffed cabbage.
[02:04:55.885 --> 02:04:57.206]  Well, no, they fought really well.
[02:04:57.266 --> 02:04:59.466]  They're just up against a giant Russian military.
[02:04:59.986 --> 02:05:01.207]  Yeah, no, I'm very sad for them.
[02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:04.107]  They got lured into this to be a sacrificial lamb.
[02:05:04.147 --> 02:05:06.068]  The West is ready to fight to the last Ukrainian.
[02:05:07.426 --> 02:05:07.926]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:08.247 --> 02:05:08.607]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:08.647 --> 02:05:09.707]  And that's what I said.
[02:05:10.028 --> 02:05:12.049]  It'd be like Texas trying to take on the U.S.
[02:05:12.089 --> 02:05:15.531]  You know, it means Texas would put up a good fight, but it's never going to work.
[02:05:16.152 --> 02:05:16.652]  Exactly.
[02:05:16.712 --> 02:05:20.895]  So what's your take on the COVID?
[02:05:22.315 --> 02:05:33.908]   Well, my real take on COVID, one reason I moved to Western North Carolina, I had a little property up here and when COVID hit, I'll be dang down there in Southwest Florida.
[02:05:34.628 --> 02:05:36.288]  I got type 2 diabetes.
[02:05:36.388 --> 02:05:39.549]  I'm not heavy, heavy, but I'm not the skinniest guy in the world.
[02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:47.572]  And Alex, I got put in, I lived in the second largest senior population in Charlotte County in the state of the U.S.
[02:05:47.932 --> 02:05:48.552]  for CAPA.
[02:05:49.452 --> 02:05:52.053]  And it was like a horror movie, Alex.
[02:05:52.133 --> 02:05:55.094]  And they had a reefer truck set up outside out my window.
[02:05:55.774 --> 02:06:00.636]  And the nurses were crying and they were just bringing people out, body by the hour.
[02:06:01.448 --> 02:06:06.412]  Anyways, Alex, I'm only 50 years old at the time, three years ago, and I was like, oh, this is gonna be a breeze.
[02:06:07.172 --> 02:06:21.803]  Well, about a week later, I couldn't breathe, and within three or four days, I turned blue, and they shot me up with radesimir, and all the muscles, three days later, all the muscles and tendons around my heart ripped loose on me from the reaction I had from the radesimir.
[02:06:22.003 --> 02:06:23.204]  Oh, yeah, radesimir kills you.
[02:06:23.284 --> 02:06:24.265]  Wow, but you survived.
[02:06:25.336 --> 02:06:26.256]  Yeah, you know what Alex?
[02:06:26.336 --> 02:06:29.297]  It was killing a lot of people in there, and I'm surprised.
[02:06:29.317 --> 02:06:30.317]  I still have problems.
[02:06:30.437 --> 02:06:32.658]  I still see a heart doctor.
[02:06:33.098 --> 02:06:40.379]  If I didn't have it, I think I probably wouldn't be here in the first place, but I think there's other treatments they could have given me too, like Ivermectin and other stuff.
[02:06:40.639 --> 02:06:41.179]  Absolutely.
[02:06:41.279 --> 02:06:42.660]  Alright Travis, thank you so much.
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:46.300]  Nico in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:06:47.201 --> 02:06:48.341]  Hey Alex, how you doing sir?
[02:06:48.381 --> 02:06:49.021]  Good brother, go ahead.
[02:06:50.168 --> 02:06:58.111]  So listen, Alex, man, first-time caller, long-time listener, man, I've been waiting years to get on the phone with you and talk to you and thank you for everything that you do for us.
[02:06:58.971 --> 02:07:03.733]  As an Armenian-American in Glendale, California, living in Commie, California, it's a little difficult sometimes.
[02:07:04.153 --> 02:07:07.975]  You know, I wear a lot of your products, walk around in the streets, and I get a lot of criticism from people.
[02:07:08.675 --> 02:07:29.987]   And, you know, I've been focusing on what's been going on with Putin in North Korea and what's going on in my home country, in Armenia, and I wanted to thank you For all the time that you put all that coverage for the Armenian war, and how you supported the Christians out there, and how you always put the light to things that people haven't, and how you always represent humanity.
[02:07:30.727 --> 02:07:37.892]  And, you know, I'm so sad and I'm upset about what's going on with you over there, and how they're trying to shut you down.
[02:07:38.452 --> 02:07:41.794]  And my main thing that I'm always worried about is the petrodollar.
[02:07:41.814 --> 02:07:46.197]  I'm worried about what's going on, how everybody's ganging up against the United States right now.
[02:07:46.943 --> 02:07:50.566]  And what's going to happen with our future and all the industries that we have over here?
[02:07:50.586 --> 02:07:51.307]  Exactly.
[02:07:51.407 --> 02:07:53.569]  And it's going on, especially in California.
[02:07:53.409 --> 02:07:57.409]   us into collapse. That's what I was dealing with Cam, he didn't quite answer that. But
[02:07:57.409 --> 02:08:01.569]   our own elites, he says, well they're cornered. No, they positioned us for this.
[02:08:01.569 --> 02:08:06.609]   Exactly. And it's going on, especially in California. Like you have no idea what
[02:08:06.609 --> 02:08:10.288]   kind of scrutiny I go through wearing your t-shirts and you know.
[02:08:10.248 --> 02:08:15.488]   I mean, I have your stickers in my Bible when I read it and I pray for you all the time.
[02:08:15.488 --> 02:08:20.448]   And it's like, you know, like I realized like, you know, being in a city like this where
[02:08:20.448 --> 02:08:26.728]   I feel like Biden is just flooding the country with people to replace the patriotic people.
[02:08:27.107 --> 02:08:29.990]  And it's like, I feel like there's a population replacement going on.
[02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:30.670]  Well, that's right.
[02:08:30.731 --> 02:08:38.317]  Last week, a new memo came out from the White House admitting that Latin Americans love their great people, but they're socialists or communists on average.
[02:08:38.697 --> 02:08:40.138]  They literally want communists here.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:42.100]  Exactly.
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:45.403]  And I mean, trust me, I get a lot of criticism from being even a Christian.
[02:08:46.036 --> 02:08:52.904]  And sometimes people tell me, well, you don't live the Christian life to the T. Well, I would ask those people there, how are you liking the new world order?
[02:08:52.944 --> 02:08:55.087]  Like, California is a beautiful state, it's falling apart.
[02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:57.269]  Oh yeah, you know what it is?
[02:08:57.309 --> 02:08:59.070]  You know what I realized over here?
[02:08:59.150 --> 02:09:00.830]  It's socialism to the extreme.
[02:09:01.170 --> 02:09:05.291]  And I'm even scared to talk about it because I feel like I'm always being like, you know, like watched.
[02:09:05.692 --> 02:09:16.394]  And there's a lot of things that you've talked about and that even Greg Reese has talked about that I feel like with this whole spirituality thing that's going on with the government and the military that I don't even want to get into for my own safety.
[02:09:17.095 --> 02:09:29.400]   But like, you know, being like, Being an individual here and being patriotic when you're an Armenian, and a lot of Armenians over here are very patriotic for their homeland, but there's a lot of great Armenian-Americans too, so I'm not trying to bash my own people.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.942]  They're very good people, and a lot of them appreciate the things that you do for our culture and Christianity.
[02:09:34.562 --> 02:09:37.343]  But, like, I live in a multicultural city.
[02:09:37.403 --> 02:09:40.045]  I live in a very elite city in Glendale, California.
[02:09:40.085 --> 02:09:44.367]  It's a very elite city where, like, you have to live a certain way over here.
[02:09:44.947 --> 02:09:50.058]   And, I mean, me being an American raised Alex, my brother, great to talk to you.
[02:09:50.138 --> 02:09:52.079]  Okay, so you're talking about chances of nuclear war.
[02:09:52.099 --> 02:09:53.640]  I honestly, Alex, I put it at less than 5%.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:55.979]   You were right in the end, we appreciate your call, God bless you.
[02:09:55.979 --> 02:09:59.579]   Alright, Mike in Nebraska, Mike thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:09:59.579 --> 02:10:01.979]  Alex, my brother, great to talk to you.
[02:10:01.979 --> 02:10:05.739]  Okay, so you're talking about chances of nuclear war.
[02:10:05.739 --> 02:10:10.219]   I honestly Alex, I put it at less than 5% and here's my reason why.
[02:10:10.219 --> 02:10:11.219]  I hope you're right.
[02:10:11.219 --> 02:10:14.779]  Well, I think I am because here's my reason why, Alex.
[02:10:14.789 --> 02:10:19.012]  The elites know that they cannot survive without a servant class, okay?
[02:10:19.452 --> 02:10:24.075]  So it's just like you were talking about with Kim.com about Zuckerberg and his bunker in Hawaii.
[02:10:24.615 --> 02:10:29.638]  Everybody knows that, okay, if you had a nuclear war, Putin's already got nuclear subs down in Cuba.
[02:10:30.078 --> 02:10:33.140]  He's got nuclear subs right off the entire East Coast line.
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:34.481]  He's got them off the West Coast.
[02:10:34.941 --> 02:10:47.409]  I don't know how great the intercontinental ballistic missiles are that have been sitting around since the 60s and 70s, but listen, the entire East Coast could be evaporated, same with where I'm at here in the Midwest.
[02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:53.774]  It's not going to happen because, Alex, the elites are not going to give up their control because they don't know that they can't farm.
[02:10:53.994 --> 02:10:55.535]  Like you said, they can't run a trot line.
[02:10:55.575 --> 02:10:56.496]  They can't skin a buck.
[02:10:56.816 --> 02:10:57.656]  They can't do none of that.
[02:10:57.676 --> 02:11:01.679]  They need a servant class, and if a servant class is all dead, they ain't going to be able to eat.
[02:11:01.759 --> 02:11:04.461]  And they're trying to get the robots in place, but that's not worked.
[02:11:04.901 --> 02:11:06.543]  Yeah, but what's a robot gonna do, Alex?
[02:11:06.583 --> 02:11:07.705]  A robot's not gonna do nothing.
[02:11:07.725 --> 02:11:08.886]  So here's my thing.
[02:11:09.266 --> 02:11:16.875]  If I do, I put a chance at a World War III, more conventional World War III, at about probably 90%.
[02:11:16.956 --> 02:11:19.398]  Here's my take on... Oh, no, no, no.
[02:11:19.419 --> 02:11:20.079]  You're not wrong.
[02:11:20.159 --> 02:11:20.800]  It's already happened.
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:22.883]  We're already in a conventional World War III.
[02:11:23.383 --> 02:11:26.826]  Well, you have warships heading over to the Mediterranean.
[02:11:27.146 --> 02:11:32.610]  Here's the Mediterranean right now, and I know Israel wants to get United States soldiers over there to fight Hezbollah.
[02:11:32.630 --> 02:11:34.491]  So here's my take on what's going to happen.
[02:11:34.532 --> 02:11:38.895]  You got Biden to let in 10 million criminal aliens into this country.
[02:11:39.857 --> 02:11:47.201]  I would look for maybe a false flag, maybe a real terrorist attack, then fighting a go and go.
[02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:55.065]  Russia, Russia, Russia, Putin, and that'll be his excuse to really get into more conventional head-to-head combat with the Russian baron.
[02:11:55.085 --> 02:11:56.185]  Here's what I think, Alex.
[02:11:56.605 --> 02:12:00.867]  I wouldn't be surprised, because I heard that the Senate basically is going to vote.
[02:12:00.927 --> 02:12:01.728]  I just passed the House.
[02:12:02.048 --> 02:12:06.330]  The Senate is going to vote on whether women can get drafted into the military.
[02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.610]  Absolutely.
[02:12:06.630 --> 02:12:08.031]  They're getting the drafts ready everywhere.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.963]  Right, and now I heard too that it might go up to 26 years old.
[02:12:12.003 --> 02:12:15.726]  I thought it was already at 35 back in the Vietnam days, but whatever.
[02:12:16.427 --> 02:12:18.128]  It's on, the war is on the horizon.
[02:12:18.148 --> 02:12:20.090]  Here's my thing, what I think is going to happen, Alex.
[02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:24.053]  I think that Biden is going to basically be FDR 2.0.
[02:12:24.574 --> 02:12:25.875]  There's going to be something happen.
[02:12:26.255 --> 02:12:28.697]  It's going to give him his excuse to stop the elections.
[02:12:29.118 --> 02:12:30.138]  And he's going to say, you know what?
[02:12:30.279 --> 02:12:30.619]  I'm FDR 2.0.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.502]  He's going to go die in office and Dr. Jill or whoever the hell else is going to go and take power from him.
[02:12:37.943 --> 02:12:40.644]  That petro-vegetable is going to... I think you're right.
[02:12:40.664 --> 02:12:43.025]  I think they might kill Biden.
[02:12:43.145 --> 02:12:43.665]  Absolutely.
[02:12:43.705 --> 02:12:44.866]  That's really great points.
[02:12:45.866 --> 02:12:47.147]  But that's my take.
[02:12:47.247 --> 02:12:52.269]  I don't think nuclear war... I pray that there's no nuclear war, but World War III, like you said, it's here.
[02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:59.592]  Conventionally, if we go head-to-head with the Russian bear, that's not going to go well for Biden's military or the United States as a whole either, Alex.
[02:13:00.984 --> 02:13:01.384]  Well, that's right.
[02:13:01.424 --> 02:13:05.127]  Putin's using limited forces and is holding back the main force.
[02:13:05.147 --> 02:13:05.927]  This is a disaster.
[02:13:05.967 --> 02:13:06.708]  Thank you for the call.
[02:13:07.048 --> 02:13:07.588]  Great points.
[02:13:08.008 --> 02:13:08.969]  Rand in New York.
[02:13:09.029 --> 02:13:09.910]  Rand, thanks for calling.
[02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:10.230]  Go ahead.
[02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:12.751]  Hey, good day, Alex.
[02:13:13.032 --> 02:13:17.174]  I'm on a first-time caller, but the last time I called was probably about 13 years ago.
[02:13:17.274 --> 02:13:17.955]  It's okay, brother.
[02:13:17.975 --> 02:13:18.615]  I'm going to talk to you.
[02:13:18.635 --> 02:13:18.955]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.796 --> 02:13:20.136]  Thank you.
[02:13:20.156 --> 02:13:20.416]  Thank you.
[02:13:20.436 --> 02:13:21.137]  I'm going to go quick.
[02:13:21.197 --> 02:13:22.898]  I've been having all these thoughts holding.
[02:13:22.918 --> 02:13:24.039]  I'm going to go fast.
[02:13:24.339 --> 02:13:40.123]   My best way, I think, to help solve everything, and especially World War III, is If Trump does get in the White House, he guaranteed got to bring in Rand Paul and Ron Paul and a list of other people that like, you know, we all agree should be in the White House.
[02:13:41.184 --> 02:13:50.993]  The next point, we should have a list of standard operating procedures for every type of problem that you have been bringing up.
[02:13:51.033 --> 02:13:53.095]  So we know all the type of potential problems.
[02:13:53.696 --> 02:14:02.002]   And maybe that could be like a link on your page that People could just click, and then they see, like, okay, if there's this type of problem, these are the type of solutions we're looking for.
[02:14:02.022 --> 02:14:03.402]  You're talking about an action plan.
[02:14:04.823 --> 02:14:08.104]  Exactly, but just have it connected visually for people to see.
[02:14:08.564 --> 02:14:12.865]  And then another thing, I love when you have fun doing what you do.
[02:14:13.205 --> 02:14:17.487]  So I was imagining you in, like, a Greg Gutfeld type of episode, but in your studio.
[02:14:17.887 --> 02:14:23.449]  But, like, you do it, like, that type of style, you know, it's kind of funny, it's entertaining, but it's serious at the same time.
[02:14:25.906 --> 02:14:31.851]  If you could do one show per week that you could try to do mostly calls, because I always hear such great points from the callers.
[02:14:32.752 --> 02:14:44.982]  And then the last point, if you can get someone on the Infowars team who's like from like a really, really ghetto type of neighborhood to constantly be out and like trying to pass this information to the streets.
[02:14:45.382 --> 02:14:47.304]  Because there's Patriots all over.
[02:14:47.484 --> 02:14:50.707]  And I know you know that you've met Patriots from every type of background.
[02:14:51.087 --> 02:14:59.084]   But I think this is one, especially growing up in New York, That is like people, they know, but they need more of like an outlet.
[02:14:59.804 --> 02:15:06.806]  I don't know if they don't always like see your show and see like if it connects with them well.
[02:15:07.186 --> 02:15:12.748]  So I feel like they could be somebody who can help connect with like those type of people.
[02:15:12.948 --> 02:15:15.169]  Hey brother, thank you Rand.
[02:15:15.609 --> 02:15:17.429]  Let's talk to Cullen in Oregon.
[02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:18.229]  Cullen, go ahead.
[02:15:20.170 --> 02:15:21.230]  Alex, what a pleasure.
[02:15:22.151 --> 02:15:22.471]  Thank you.
[02:15:24.681 --> 02:15:28.643]  Obviously, all your listeners agree that World War III is definitely imminent.
[02:15:30.485 --> 02:15:33.727]  A couple quick data points.
[02:15:33.827 --> 02:15:37.489]  First of all, what was it they announced today?
[02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:41.232]  Something about nine weeks until Iran has a nuke.
[02:15:41.752 --> 02:15:50.238]  And Iran said in response to them, the CIA announcing that they were nine weeks away, that they were going to one-bomb Israel.
[02:15:52.677 --> 02:15:54.098]  So we all agree it's coming.
[02:15:55.098 --> 02:15:55.459]  Alright.
[02:15:55.879 --> 02:16:03.343]  Now, my idea is that the only thing that can stop it is a giant technological breakthrough.
[02:16:04.563 --> 02:16:09.026]  Something like, I was playing with AI and I did a bunch of math with- Free energy!
[02:16:10.777 --> 02:16:12.618]  That would be sure a good one, wouldn't it?
[02:16:13.138 --> 02:16:15.519]  Of course, free energy might change the world.
[02:16:15.899 --> 02:16:22.721]  But I think it might start with, when I was doing the math, alright, so here's what it came down to when I was playing with AI.
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.980]  So there's currently 118 known stable elements.
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:33.820]  And AI's math said that there's 88 more to be discovered.
[02:16:34.014 --> 02:16:36.637]  And its formula was 118 negative 30 equals 88.
[02:16:37.779 --> 02:16:43.646]  And why it found that, I don't know, but it said there's 88 synthetic undiscovered elements.
[02:16:44.401 --> 02:17:03.488]  And then I further played with it to find out if any of them could be stabilized, and it was saying something about a 126 proton element, theoretically, could be stable because it fills the shell full of protons so that it creates a stability.
[02:17:04.189 --> 02:17:09.851]  Now, if we were to create a new element, all new things would bust loose, especially a heavy element like that.
[02:17:11.308 --> 02:17:14.470]  But that's exactly what the globalists are about, is suppressing new technology.
[02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:19.172]  Oh, the globalists are currently working on a dual plan.
[02:17:19.632 --> 02:17:22.654]  There's two scripts written by the globalists currently, in my opinion.
[02:17:23.214 --> 02:17:31.279]  One, that Joe Biden's going to follow, and two, that they're going to force down Donald Trump's throat if he gets, when he gets elected.
[02:17:31.659 --> 02:17:37.342]  Donald Trump is going to be forced down this script that they've already written of planned events.
[02:17:40.094 --> 02:17:43.955]  So unfortunately, even if Trump wins, they're going to make us fight World War III.
[02:17:44.416 --> 02:17:44.936]  Well, that's right.
[02:17:44.956 --> 02:17:49.878]  That's why Fauci said in 2017, don't worry, we're about to release a virus.
[02:17:50.238 --> 02:17:51.818]  That'll make Trump do what we say.
[02:17:56.790 --> 02:18:02.214]  That was planned to make Trump lose, to put them back in power, to make sure that they could secure World War III.
[02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:10.739]  There's a reason why Joe Biden and the Democrats, because Joe Biden's one of the lead Democrats, obviously, president of the United States, even though he's a puppet president.
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:14.182]  So, he still was playing in Ukraine.
[02:18:14.242 --> 02:18:15.863]  His entire play was in Ukraine.
[02:18:15.903 --> 02:18:20.886]  Isn't it just too big of a coincidence that everything pops off around Ukraine?
[02:18:20.906 --> 02:18:23.648]  So why do you think that's the case?
[02:18:25.299 --> 02:18:36.268]  I think it's the case because the globalists, the leaders of the world, wrote the entire script around Ukraine because they knew that that was the only fight to get Russia into the fight.
[02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:37.209]  Absolutely.
[02:18:37.269 --> 02:18:38.210]  Great point, Cohen.
[02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:39.471]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:18:39.571 --> 02:18:44.235]  Come back with Kevin, Dave, Matthew, Jacob, Jay, Nature Boy.
[02:18:44.255 --> 02:18:45.896]  Is that Ric Flair calling in?
[02:18:46.457 --> 02:18:47.298]  And Mark.
[02:18:47.598 --> 02:18:48.018]  Woo!
[02:18:48.759 --> 02:18:49.520]  Before I go to break...
[02:18:50.336 --> 02:18:51.279]  We want to stop World War III.
[02:18:51.299 --> 02:18:52.021]  We want to do all this.
[02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:53.866]  If Infowars is on the air, it won't matter.
[02:18:54.588 --> 02:18:56.594]  So please support our sponsors.

[02:21:05.405 --> 02:21:10.772]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[02:21:11.253 --> 02:21:12.915]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[02:21:13.435 --> 02:21:18.675]   Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up and they smash
[02:21:18.675 --> 02:21:22.755]   the bones and guts of the fish and it gets contaminants in it.
[02:21:22.755 --> 02:21:29.034]   We sell the highest grade fish oil there is and it's pure fish oil and it's not been pasteurized

[02:21:54.514 --> 02:22:05.075]  ultimate fish oil.
[02:22:05.075 --> 02:22:06.275]  Here's the big takeaway.
[02:22:06.275 --> 02:22:16.275]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:22:07.762 --> 02:22:11.785]  The American order set up after World War II 80 years ago is coming to an end.
[02:22:13.206 --> 02:22:19.691]  We have psychotic Satanist pedophiles running our countries that are at war with us while they're at war with the earth.
[02:22:21.512 --> 02:22:23.113]  And all the other populations in it.
[02:22:23.714 --> 02:22:25.815]  This is an explosive situation.
[02:22:25.855 --> 02:22:31.579]  Their arrogance, their satanic hubris, their incredible confidence is what will undo them.
[02:22:31.979 --> 02:22:33.781]  And I use a microcosm of that.
[02:22:35.401 --> 02:22:43.768]  A week and a half ago in federal court, the federally appointed CRO was going to fire me, shut us down, and the judge kept saying, Alex Jones owns and runs this.
[02:22:44.829 --> 02:22:47.391]  And the CRO goes, no, I run it, it's my company.
[02:22:48.312 --> 02:22:49.292]  The judge says, you're fired.
[02:22:51.855 --> 02:22:53.476]  He said, no I'm not, I run this company.
[02:22:55.317 --> 02:22:56.158]  The judge said, you're fired.
[02:22:57.479 --> 02:22:59.421]  There's something about evil people.
[02:23:00.828 --> 02:23:05.492]  Where they have this chutzpah, they have this bravado, they have this hubris, they have this arrogance.
[02:23:05.832 --> 02:23:09.835]  The more power I get, the more concerned I am that I'm going to misuse it.
[02:23:10.816 --> 02:23:11.476]  Not these people.
[02:23:12.277 --> 02:23:15.919]  They love raw, mindless power.
[02:23:18.301 --> 02:23:21.043]  And so, I wish we had a competent elite.
[02:23:22.004 --> 02:23:24.906]  Even if they were evil, I would think, well, at least they're not going to destroy the planet.
[02:23:24.966 --> 02:23:25.867]  No, they are.
[02:23:28.726 --> 02:23:32.389]  So whether we have nuclear war or not, the economic collapse is already here.
[02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:33.650]  The inflation is already here.
[02:23:35.232 --> 02:23:36.333]  There's no reversing this now.
[02:23:36.793 --> 02:23:40.816]  The question is, what do we do to rebuild it and to be on the other side?
[02:23:41.157 --> 02:23:43.859]  Because the globalists want to use the crisis to bring in total control.
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:50.465]  We didn't create the crisis, but we should then respond to it and build something better on the other side.
[02:23:51.305 --> 02:23:55.169]  Not build back better, but build back something that works.
[02:23:56.721 --> 02:23:58.263]  Kevin in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:23:58.284 --> 02:23:58.945]  Nuclear war.
[02:24:00.267 --> 02:24:00.968]  How do we stop it?
[02:24:01.008 --> 02:24:01.428]  What's your view?
[02:24:02.915 --> 02:24:03.855]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:03.895 --> 02:24:13.437]  First, I want to take this time to glorify God and thank my Lord, David, Jesus Christ, for allowing me to come on, because I prayed to get on here, and call failed, call failed, got through, so I appreciate it.
[02:24:13.657 --> 02:24:13.957]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:13.977 --> 02:24:15.418]  Second, I want to plug Nitric Boost.
[02:24:15.438 --> 02:24:18.558]  I want to plug your foundational energy and Turbo Force.
[02:24:18.578 --> 02:24:20.799]  Those are definitely life-changing supplements for me.
[02:24:21.259 --> 02:24:28.280]  Struggled with a lot of blood pressure issues, struggled with energy issues, and on a consistent regimen with working out and good eating.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:32.441]  Definitely been a catalyst for my good health, so I appreciate that.
[02:24:33.141 --> 02:24:37.982]  And then, kind of leading into that, with that being said, one verse comes to my mind.
[02:24:38.022 --> 02:24:40.283]  That's 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 7.
[02:24:40.423 --> 02:24:45.544]  It says, God didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind.
[02:24:45.564 --> 02:24:48.764]  I think we don't want to be led by fear in this.
[02:24:48.924 --> 02:24:55.306]  I think we need to look at this situation, because this is a serious situation we're in when we're talking about stuff like this.
[02:24:55.346 --> 02:24:56.026]  You have kids.
[02:24:56.166 --> 02:24:56.746]  I have kids.
[02:24:57.529 --> 02:25:02.812]  Not something we want to, you know, be focused on as a fear going in with our lives and raising our kids.
[02:25:02.872 --> 02:25:08.155]  But our expectation right now is to lean on our elected officials to balance this out.
[02:25:08.275 --> 02:25:12.617]  But at what point do you kind of bench them and put them to the side?
[02:25:12.657 --> 02:25:13.538]  Use a sports analogy.
[02:25:13.558 --> 02:25:17.260]  If your quarterback's throwing the game, coach is going to pull the quarterback out.
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:18.721]  So what does it look like?
[02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:20.562]  What needs to exist for us to unite?
[02:25:21.391 --> 02:25:23.113]  Well sure, I mean let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:25:23.593 --> 02:25:27.436]  The average local or state or federal politician is not even a bad man or woman.
[02:25:27.757 --> 02:25:30.399]  They're compartmentalized, they do what they're told, they have no idea.
[02:25:31.059 --> 02:25:35.023]  And so yeah, they're way above, they're way below their pay grade.
[02:25:36.144 --> 02:25:36.584]  That's right.
[02:25:36.624 --> 02:25:47.814]  Now, you know, when you talk about getting the bright minds together to come up with a plan to rebound from this per se, well first of all, we need to lead with power.
[02:25:48.487 --> 02:25:49.748]  Real, true power.
[02:25:49.868 --> 02:25:50.689]  Power of truth.
[02:25:51.149 --> 02:25:51.469]  Love.
[02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:53.351]  Love your neighbor as yourself, right?
[02:25:53.371 --> 02:25:57.694]  If we can't do that, our vision is going to be completely gone.
[02:25:57.994 --> 02:25:58.575]  We're blind.
[02:25:58.795 --> 02:26:00.196]  We're going into everything blind.
[02:26:00.917 --> 02:26:09.323]  There's that group, the Satanists out there, the globalists that are led by Satan, they're blinding the world to that true, pure love that God created for us.
[02:26:09.764 --> 02:26:11.505]  God created us to be one body.
[02:26:12.045 --> 02:26:14.307]  And when you have division in that, it's like cancer.
[02:26:14.327 --> 02:26:15.048]  It's like a tumor.
[02:26:15.088 --> 02:26:17.730]  It's going to suck that out of you and look at where we are.
[02:26:18.649 --> 02:26:27.753]  So we need, we have so many people in the country that are like a George Washington that can, they're just sitting at the coach on the sidelines like, hey, when are you going to put me in?
[02:26:27.793 --> 02:26:35.978]  They don't know how, they don't have the education of how to get together as a community, as a nation, because what's the ratio for us to them?
[02:26:36.178 --> 02:26:38.059]  It's got to be a huge difference, right?
[02:26:38.599 --> 02:26:39.159]  Would you agree?
[02:26:39.659 --> 02:26:41.860]  Brother, I totally agree with you and thanks for the call.
[02:26:42.481 --> 02:26:44.542]  Now I want to hit this next video to go back to your calls.
[02:26:45.492 --> 02:26:46.913]  Joe Rogan sent this to me this morning.
[02:26:46.933 --> 02:26:47.773]  He said, is this real?
[02:26:48.574 --> 02:26:49.214]  And I said, yeah.
[02:26:50.254 --> 02:27:00.400]  A peel is this covering they spray on fruit and vegetables that Bill Gates owns that literally puts it into cryonic freeze.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:02.361]  So it lasts three times longer.
[02:27:02.461 --> 02:27:06.263]  But it does something weird to it because fruit and vegetables breathe.
[02:27:07.082 --> 02:27:15.551]  So people been opening up appeal bananas and they they're like rubber or avocados and people like what is this?
[02:27:15.611 --> 02:27:18.434]  So this is what they're bombing us with this.
[02:27:18.754 --> 02:27:19.735]  You will eat bugs.
[02:27:19.775 --> 02:27:21.878]  You will all this is anti-human.
[02:27:21.898 --> 02:27:23.740]  They want to scramble things so bad.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:27.984]  They're assaulting us through the injections to the air through the 5g through the GMO.
[02:27:28.264 --> 02:27:28.705]  Here's the club.
[02:27:30.034 --> 02:27:33.176]  Are Costco and Whole Foods selling fake fruits?
[02:27:33.756 --> 02:27:36.678]  I've been hearing about this, but check out what's happening to these people.
[02:27:36.998 --> 02:27:43.502]  When she opens it, and she breaks it in half, it gets very tough and doesn't really break.
[02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:47.305]  And when it pulls, it's like it's glue.
[02:27:48.045 --> 02:27:52.028]  Like, it's not even breaking, like at all.
[02:27:53.128 --> 02:27:55.470]  And I know you guys can't feel the texture, obviously, right?
[02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:56.330]  Because it's a video.
[02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:59.958]   But like, It literally feels fake.
[02:27:59.998 --> 02:28:02.818]  Those people posting rubbery watermelon.
[02:28:03.419 --> 02:28:04.659]  I can't believe I got one.
[02:28:04.839 --> 02:28:06.160]  I got a rubbery watermelon.
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:09.621]  The texture is so weird.
[02:28:09.641 --> 02:28:12.401]  But there's a clanking and it sounds like something's stuck.
[02:28:12.842 --> 02:28:17.323]  So I go in the drain and there's a blueberry that's not breaking apart.
[02:28:17.443 --> 02:28:19.664]  It's not doing anything.
[02:28:19.884 --> 02:28:20.804]  It's what's making the noise.
[02:28:21.764 --> 02:28:31.846]   And I pick it up and Why is there a rubber blueberry in my toddler's snack?
[02:28:32.687 --> 02:28:35.349]  This came from the carton of blueberries.
[02:28:35.929 --> 02:28:36.970]  My husband cut it in half.
[02:28:37.610 --> 02:28:41.093]  I really don't know if you can see it that well.
[02:28:42.174 --> 02:28:42.554]  Glistening.
[02:28:42.594 --> 02:28:43.135]  It's silicone.
[02:28:43.175 --> 02:28:44.496]  It's a silicone blueberry.
[02:28:44.796 --> 02:28:46.758]  It is a solid rubber blueberry.
[02:28:47.638 --> 02:28:48.459]  She is under two.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:51.221]  I got this at Whole Foods also.
[02:28:51.922 --> 02:28:52.382]  Organic.
[02:28:52.482 --> 02:28:55.525]  I was trying to like, you know, do the right thing.
[02:28:56.547 --> 02:28:58.108]  Folks, this is not human.
[02:28:58.128 --> 02:29:01.209]  Overhead shot.
[02:29:01.810 --> 02:29:07.813]  As Appeal made it to grocery stores near you, Appeal Science Wikipedia.
[02:29:08.693 --> 02:29:12.915]  Meet Appeal, the new addictive poisoning of our produce.
[02:29:14.016 --> 02:29:15.497]  The new additive poisoning of our produce.
[02:29:16.277 --> 02:29:17.538]  Everything you know about Appeal.
[02:29:19.138 --> 02:29:25.062]  But what you need to know is, it turns the food, just like McDonald's products, you can put them under glass for two years, they don't rot.
[02:29:25.682 --> 02:29:29.705]  Bill Gates-backed appeal science makes fruit avocados last longer.
[02:29:30.586 --> 02:29:31.646]  Yeah, because they're dead.
[02:29:32.447 --> 02:29:33.788]  That's 2018, folks.
[02:29:34.368 --> 02:29:35.789]  That's six years ago.
[02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:40.252]  Kroger, first-take appeal produce, coast-to-coast.
[02:29:42.533 --> 02:29:44.575]  Unpacking the pros and cons of appeal produce.
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:48.102]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:29:48.542 --> 02:29:49.904]  You're like, yeah, it's an assault.
[02:29:49.964 --> 02:29:51.186]  A peel food additive is safe.
[02:29:51.486 --> 02:29:58.055]  Health authorities say, just like the shot was, a peel goes more than skin deep with new tech offerings.
[02:29:59.697 --> 02:30:01.259]  A peel, a fruitful innovation.
[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:02.942]  Unpacking the pros and cons.
[02:30:04.642 --> 02:30:18.872]  So here is a food researcher, you can look this up, it's all true, I did about an hour of research today, on just the potatoes and the supposed fries from McDonald's, which Bill Gates is one of the main owners of, and it's not even potato.
[02:30:18.912 --> 02:30:19.253]  Here it is.
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:22.822]  Did you eat McDonald's french fries even once in a while?
[02:30:23.102 --> 02:30:24.964]  After you hear this, I think you'll say no.
[02:30:25.064 --> 02:30:28.146]  First of all, you can see how perfectly white they are.
[02:30:28.326 --> 02:30:31.729]  Because they allow no blemish in their potatoes.
[02:30:31.749 --> 02:30:32.950]  And how they accomplish that?
[02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:36.953]  They spray it with one of the most toxic pesticides on the planet.
[02:30:37.213 --> 02:30:40.796]  After the farmer sprays it, he can't be in the field for five days.
[02:30:41.076 --> 02:30:42.497]  Oh, after they harvest them?
[02:30:42.637 --> 02:30:47.079]  It has to go in a special atmosphere controlled environment for six weeks.
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:48.460]  That's how toxic it is.
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:49.621]  It's not safe to eat.
[02:30:49.801 --> 02:30:52.122]  Guess how many ingredients I found in this?
[02:30:52.322 --> 02:30:52.983]  Oh, not one.
[02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:53.603]  Potatoes.
[02:30:53.883 --> 02:30:56.124]  Potatoes are one of the eleven that I found.
[02:30:56.204 --> 02:30:57.345]  But I had to write them down.
[02:30:57.685 --> 02:31:03.809]  Vegetable oil, which consists of soybean oil, canola oil, corn oil, which are horrible for you, by the way.
[02:31:03.889 --> 02:31:05.830]  Natural beef flavors, not so natural.
[02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:07.711]  It's hydrolyzed wheat and hydrolyzed milk.
[02:31:07.751 --> 02:31:08.551]  Horrible for you.
[02:31:08.611 --> 02:31:08.912]  Wheat.
[02:31:09.432 --> 02:31:10.372]  Milk derivatives.
[02:31:10.733 --> 02:31:11.473]  Dextrose.
[02:31:11.693 --> 02:31:15.475]  Sodium acid and pyrophosphate and salt.
[02:31:15.995 --> 02:31:18.176]  11 plus ingredients and a load of chemicals.
[02:31:18.276 --> 02:31:19.097]  I don't suggest it.
[02:31:21.838 --> 02:31:23.139]  This is a big plan folks.
[02:31:24.279 --> 02:31:25.900]  And look at this stack of news.
[02:31:27.681 --> 02:31:28.101]  Right here.
[02:31:28.742 --> 02:31:29.762]  Excuse me, two stacks.
[02:31:30.643 --> 02:31:32.103]  Let's look at these two stacks right now.
[02:31:33.404 --> 02:31:34.745]  This is just today's news.
[02:31:35.925 --> 02:31:43.568]  All the studies, all the information, massive brain damage, Canadian studies, South Korean studies, U.S.
[02:31:43.588 --> 02:31:43.948]  studies.
[02:31:46.008 --> 02:31:46.989]  And it goes on from there.
[02:31:47.889 --> 02:31:52.611]  But first, masks are going from mandated to criminalized in some states.
[02:31:52.691 --> 02:32:02.234]  Lawmakers in North Carolina and New York say mask bans in response to pro-Palestinian protests would not target medical masks wearing, which is a sign you're in the cult.
[02:32:03.999 --> 02:32:05.000]  I felt like I was dying.
[02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:10.282]  News photographer injured by COVID booster is now on a mission to change vaccine policy.
[02:32:11.463 --> 02:32:15.585]  Potential association between COVID-19 vaccination and development of Alzheimer's disease.
[02:32:16.005 --> 02:32:17.446]  A major study.
[02:32:18.847 --> 02:32:20.568]  One of many about the incredible brain damage.
[02:32:21.028 --> 02:32:22.929]  Now it goes into the blood-brain barrier.
[02:32:24.730 --> 02:32:28.932]  The potential association between COVID-19 vaccination and development of Alzheimer's disease.
[02:32:29.253 --> 02:32:31.354]  Look, you take the shot, and what's Alzheimer's do?
[02:32:33.851 --> 02:32:34.491]  Go straight up.
[02:32:35.972 --> 02:32:37.673]  And here's the latest numbers.
[02:32:40.094 --> 02:32:56.882]  Turns out the Australian government, all the major governments got this, got a document before they started the shots in late 2000, just like the CDC warned of it, and the FDA, saying it attacks the liver, the brain, the kidneys, everything.
[02:32:59.394 --> 02:33:03.255]  Pfizer COVID mRNA vaccine bio-distribution study.
[02:33:03.695 --> 02:33:09.377]  It goes into every major organ.
[02:33:11.017 --> 02:33:33.584]   The bladder, the bone marrow, the brain, the eyes, the heart, the kidneys, the large intestine, the lung, the lymph nodes, the ovaries, the pancreas, the pituitary gland, the prostate, They put nuclear markers, atomic markers, with it in rats and they saw what it did.
[02:33:37.145 --> 02:33:39.747]  How could they approve this if they knew it was going to happen?
[02:33:39.767 --> 02:33:41.928]  The unspoken truth is this was deliberate murder.
[02:33:42.248 --> 02:33:47.450]  They not only murdered and sterilized the Australian population, that's just the Australian news.
[02:33:49.835 --> 02:33:59.860]  Explosive study, once renowned by Lancet within 24 hours, now peer-reviewed and public, reveals 74% of deaths directly linked to COVID-19 shots.
[02:34:03.002 --> 02:34:10.926]  Meanwhile, Elon Musk says Bill Gates may bring down Western civilization.
[02:34:12.067 --> 02:34:18.591]  I've got the clip actually here of a renowned doctor in the UK going over all of this.
[02:34:19.625 --> 02:34:23.926]  And talking about what these shots actually do.
[02:34:25.306 --> 02:34:41.290]  And now videos have surfaced back during the so-called pandemic where they were paid $2 billion at CVS and Walgreens not to give ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to medical doctors who wanted to prescribe it.
[02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:43.611]  They were paid to kill people.
[02:34:45.205 --> 02:34:50.671]  They know exactly what they are doing every single time.
[02:34:52.352 --> 02:34:53.834]  Let's play a few minutes of clip 16.
[02:34:54.775 --> 02:34:58.078]  This is Dr. Zelenko, who died last year, a great patriot.
[02:34:59.039 --> 02:35:02.883]  Back at the time he was subscribing it to thousands of patients being blocked from getting it.
[02:35:04.079 --> 02:35:06.581]  I feel you're discriminating against me.
[02:35:07.062 --> 02:35:08.503]  Why would it be discrimination?
[02:35:08.743 --> 02:35:10.064]  Maybe because I'm Jewish?
[02:35:10.124 --> 02:35:10.424]  I don't know.
[02:35:10.565 --> 02:35:11.245]  What is it?
[02:35:11.505 --> 02:35:13.407]  What are you talking about?
[02:35:13.747 --> 02:35:14.288]  I'm not sure.
[02:35:14.348 --> 02:35:16.670]  Why would you not give me my medication?
[02:35:17.591 --> 02:35:22.214]  It's because we're not allowed to do it unless that person is in a clinical trial.
[02:35:22.294 --> 02:35:23.115]  That's not true.
[02:35:23.796 --> 02:35:25.797]  I'm a prescribing physician for hundreds of patients.
[02:35:26.218 --> 02:35:27.499]  It's just not true what you're saying.
[02:35:27.619 --> 02:35:30.842]  You shouldn't be doing that unless it's given an approval.
[02:35:30.942 --> 02:35:32.504]  Who are you to make that decision?
[02:35:32.784 --> 02:35:35.166]  You're just a pharmacist.
[02:35:35.486 --> 02:35:37.368]  You're not licensed to practice medicine or surgery.
[02:35:37.809 --> 02:35:41.392]  That doesn't give you the right to control how I practice medicine.
[02:35:41.592 --> 02:35:43.154]  That's an FDA approved medication.
[02:35:43.554 --> 02:35:45.356]  And I'm allowed legally to use it off-label.
[02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:47.258]  That's my right as a physician.
[02:35:47.878 --> 02:35:49.279]  Who are you to infringe on my rights?
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:50.621]  You're not a physician.
[02:35:50.641 --> 02:35:51.842]  You're just a pharmacist.
[02:35:52.634 --> 02:35:54.655]  Your job is to carry out the orders of the physicians.
[02:35:55.215 --> 02:35:56.256]  Not exactly.
[02:35:56.316 --> 02:35:59.058]  I have to do it as long as it's for the well-being of the patient.
[02:35:59.138 --> 02:35:59.538]  I agree.
[02:35:59.558 --> 02:36:01.739]  I agree, so... It's not for the well-being of the patient.
[02:36:01.759 --> 02:36:03.820]  Who are you to decide that?
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:05.581]  It's not for you to decide if it is.
[02:36:06.562 --> 02:36:09.103]  I think what you are doing is malpractice.
[02:36:11.925 --> 02:36:13.285]  It's malpractice as a pharmacist.
[02:36:13.646 --> 02:36:19.829]  And I really have to wonder... My wife is a clinician as well, so... I'm not here to talk about... That's okay.
[02:36:19.849 --> 02:36:21.190]  Your wife doesn't set policy either.
[02:36:23.024 --> 02:36:24.865]  There's no evidence against that.
[02:36:24.945 --> 02:36:30.088]  Again, it's not your role to make that decision.
[02:36:30.489 --> 02:36:36.933]  I'm a prescribing physician who is licensed to practice medicine in the state of New York, and you're not.
[02:36:38.053 --> 02:36:39.434]  You don't know your place, that's all.
[02:36:40.915 --> 02:36:43.116]  I'm sorry, I can't follow you.
[02:36:43.617 --> 02:36:49.180]  I'm asking you to justify the reason why you're withholding life-saving medication from me, that's all.
[02:36:49.984 --> 02:36:55.048]  I want to know why are you refusing to give me my life-saving medication?
[02:36:58.130 --> 02:37:04.916]  And how do you know what my medical condition is or isn't?
[02:37:05.776 --> 02:37:06.977]  Is it your role to know that?
[02:37:07.658 --> 02:37:08.518]  What about HIPPO?
[02:37:09.999 --> 02:37:11.721]  I would, yeah.
[02:37:13.122 --> 02:37:17.866]  But I don't think that's a standard of care to provide evidence to a pharmacist.
[02:37:18.606 --> 02:37:19.487]  I don't think that that's right.
[02:37:20.569 --> 02:37:21.810]  You don't do that with other people.
[02:37:22.390 --> 02:37:23.692]  This is not a controlled substance.
[02:37:24.152 --> 02:37:25.853]  This is an FDA-approved medication.
[02:37:28.255 --> 02:37:30.937]  So I'm asking you to present evidence to your... FDA-approved medication?
[02:37:30.957 --> 02:37:32.338]  What are you using it for?
[02:37:32.438 --> 02:37:34.360]  Again, and I have the right to use it off-label.
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:35.781]  It's my right as a physician.
[02:37:36.341 --> 02:37:37.442]  I'm sorry if you don't know the laws.
[02:37:38.643 --> 02:37:42.146]  The evidence is A1 through the... That what?
[02:37:43.508 --> 02:37:45.669]  So that's your opinion, but again, it's not your job.
[02:37:45.689 --> 02:37:48.109]  It's not my opinion, it's coming from the National Institute of Public Health.
[02:37:48.129 --> 02:37:50.230]  But it's not your job to decide the medication.
[02:37:50.250 --> 02:37:52.270]  It's coming from PubMed, it's coming from UpToDate.
[02:37:52.470 --> 02:37:53.871]  There's so many clinical trials.
[02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:54.351]  I understand.
[02:37:54.771 --> 02:37:57.832]  So it's your opinion that this medication doesn't work.
[02:37:58.132 --> 02:38:05.874]  I don't want my name on a prescription that has been dispensed for something outside of the labels that has been actually been proven and has been shown to be... So you're saying...
[02:38:06.634 --> 02:38:09.995]  As a physician... As a physician, I think what you're doing is wrong.
[02:38:10.175 --> 02:38:10.935]  Okay, I hear that.
[02:38:11.075 --> 02:38:17.336]  I just want to understand, as a physician, you're saying that I'm not allowed to prescribe something off-label, and that's why you're not getting it today?
[02:38:20.097 --> 02:38:23.037]  Off-label, that's kind of more of a gray area.
[02:38:23.077 --> 02:38:26.958]  I think it's because the state has told us specifically... Could I see that, please?
[02:38:26.978 --> 02:38:28.798]  Could you show me those statements?
[02:38:29.959 --> 02:38:31.219]  Because I think you're just making it up.
[02:38:33.895 --> 02:38:39.343]  That just says their opinion about whether the medication works or not.
[02:38:39.944 --> 02:38:40.404]  That's okay.
[02:38:40.925 --> 02:38:42.087]  They're allowed to have their opinion.
[02:38:43.448 --> 02:38:45.171]  But they don't govern how doctors prescribe.
[02:38:45.671 --> 02:38:50.198]  You're putting me in a situation where I need life-saving medication and you're not giving it to me.
[02:38:51.002 --> 02:38:51.803]  And for no reason.
[02:38:52.243 --> 02:38:53.644]  You're not providing any evidence.
[02:38:54.045 --> 02:38:55.446]  Except your own stubbornness and ego.
[02:38:55.466 --> 02:38:57.527]  And I think that this is criminal.
[02:38:58.208 --> 02:38:58.628]  Criminal!
[02:38:58.648 --> 02:38:59.209]  Criminal?
[02:38:59.249 --> 02:39:04.653]  I still have the right to say no to a prescription that I deem to be, you know, harmful.
[02:39:04.873 --> 02:39:06.395]  How many times have you prescribed this medication?
[02:39:06.635 --> 02:39:07.676]  Given out this medication?
[02:39:08.076 --> 02:39:08.456]  Hundreds?
[02:39:08.977 --> 02:39:10.418]  Do you do the same thing forever, Peggy?
[02:39:10.758 --> 02:39:11.999]  To children, pregnant women?
[02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.081]  We haven't given it to anyone for COVID.
[02:39:15.038 --> 02:39:17.139]  But that's not your role to decide.
[02:39:17.519 --> 02:39:18.680]  You're just a pharmacist.
[02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.381]  No, we follow... I mean, you're just very condescending.
[02:39:21.401 --> 02:39:23.542]  Just because I'm a pharmacist doesn't mean I don't know anything.
[02:39:24.122 --> 02:39:29.204]  But it's backed by evidence and from guidance from... Just show me.
[02:39:29.244 --> 02:39:30.065]  Show me the evidence.
[02:39:30.205 --> 02:39:31.625]  Alright, so let's stop right here.
[02:39:31.866 --> 02:39:34.067]  The point is they blocked hydroxychloroquine.
[02:39:34.107 --> 02:39:36.508]  They blocked ivermectin.
[02:39:37.048 --> 02:39:38.228]  And it came out in the news a month ago.
[02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:43.491]  They were paid $2 billion at CVS and Walgreens to not give it to you when your doctor said to.
[02:39:44.284 --> 02:39:47.687]  This is the computer control with some idiot in his little mask.
[02:39:48.028 --> 02:39:50.090]  Oh, my computer says I can't give it to you.
[02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:52.872]  You don't have a medical degree, asshole.
[02:39:53.233 --> 02:39:54.894]  The law says the doctor can give it to you.
[02:39:55.795 --> 02:39:57.617]  But that's what this is all about.
[02:39:57.657 --> 02:40:14.763]   And now the Australian government documents via FOIA requests have come out that they knew That it was gonna migrate into your ovaries, and your testicles, and your liver, and your brain, and create all this havoc, and they did it on purpose, and that's the point.
[02:40:15.864 --> 02:40:16.965]  You're like, why would they do this?
[02:40:18.306 --> 02:40:23.129]  Because they're psychotics, and imagine, if you're a psychotic, the power of killing a bunch of people.
[02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:25.251]  You're like, well, I don't wanna do that.
[02:40:25.311 --> 02:40:29.354]  Well, you keep judging psychotics according to how you operate.
[02:40:30.255 --> 02:40:31.176]  I'm not gonna play the clip.
[02:40:31.756 --> 02:40:32.657]  Maybe tomorrow I'll play it.
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:38.343]  It's just, it's just, I put it out on my X account this morning.
[02:40:39.444 --> 02:40:39.984]  Now I'll show you.
[02:40:40.645 --> 02:40:41.565]  I've got an X account right now.
[02:40:42.586 --> 02:40:50.311]  Go to RealAlexJones on X. We go to the main page.
[02:40:52.573 --> 02:40:53.253]  Go to profile.
[02:40:54.914 --> 02:40:55.415]  Load a minute.
[02:40:57.656 --> 02:40:58.557]  I can show you this.
[02:41:01.699 --> 02:41:02.900]  Because this is a big deal, folks.
[02:41:04.102 --> 02:41:10.984]  It's a big deal that they knew, the Australian government, four years ago, what they were about to do.
[02:41:14.745 --> 02:41:17.346]  They were absolutely fully conscious.
[02:41:17.386 --> 02:41:17.786]  Here it is.
[02:41:19.067 --> 02:41:25.649]  It's now official, the COVID shots infest the entire body, but they really like the liver and the ovaries.
[02:41:26.892 --> 02:41:30.535]  I mean, that's a government document circulated worldwide.
[02:41:31.035 --> 02:41:31.756]  They knew it.
[02:41:31.816 --> 02:41:32.817]  They lied to you.
[02:41:32.837 --> 02:41:38.201]  And I know most of you get that, but think of the magnitude of what we're up against with these dirtbags.
[02:41:39.702 --> 02:41:41.023]  I'm sorry I'm stressed out here on air.
[02:41:41.083 --> 02:41:50.151]  It's just that sitting here and taking, being mass murdered, putting up with this and watching people walk into this like it's fun and cute is sick.
[02:41:52.333 --> 02:41:53.594]  Gabe in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:41:53.614 --> 02:41:53.974]  Go ahead.
[02:41:54.975 --> 02:41:55.575]  Yes, Alex.
[02:41:56.236 --> 02:41:56.456]  Go ahead.
[02:41:57.515 --> 02:41:58.676]  Oh, thanks for taking my call.
[02:41:59.016 --> 02:42:02.900]  Look, I appreciate all what you've done for everybody.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:04.521]  I'm in Canada.
[02:42:04.921 --> 02:42:09.705]  I wish our countries would get together and just wipe those people right off the map.
[02:42:10.386 --> 02:42:12.768]  And then we could really carry on with a freedom country.
[02:42:14.249 --> 02:42:15.390]  Well, think about our governments.
[02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:16.971]  They're literally trying to kill us.
[02:42:17.151 --> 02:42:19.893]  I mean, we have total criminals in charge.
[02:42:20.834 --> 02:42:21.475]  Absolutely.
[02:42:21.535 --> 02:42:23.636]  And I know how they got there.
[02:42:24.117 --> 02:42:25.158]  You explained it to a T.
[02:42:26.016 --> 02:42:27.417]  But we have to get them out of there.
[02:42:27.657 --> 02:42:30.938]  Alex, how can we get together our countries and just take them out?
[02:42:31.579 --> 02:42:32.399]  We have to expose them.
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:33.980]  Yes.
[02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:34.940]  Yes.
[02:42:35.781 --> 02:42:37.662]  They're being exposed as we speak, Alex.
[02:42:41.564 --> 02:42:43.284]  Now, can we speak about your products?
[02:42:43.525 --> 02:42:44.805]  You haven't even pushed that yet.
[02:42:45.065 --> 02:42:47.687]  Well, what I'm doing is, we're taking calls on World War III.
[02:42:47.707 --> 02:42:48.587]  What would you take on that?
[02:42:49.608 --> 02:42:52.849]  Well, World War III, I think it's inevitable.
[02:42:55.126 --> 02:42:56.608]  I'm scared about that for my children.
[02:42:58.030 --> 02:43:00.993]  But I don't think at this point there's anything we can do but pray.
[02:43:01.013 --> 02:43:04.938]  That's about all I can say on that.
[02:43:04.958 --> 02:43:06.420]  Alright brother, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:07.081 --> 02:43:08.803]  Let's talk to Jacob in Alabama.
[02:43:08.843 --> 02:43:09.424]  Jacob, go ahead.
[02:43:10.515 --> 02:43:10.955]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:10.995 --> 02:43:12.677]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:43:12.737 --> 02:43:13.697]  I'm a longtime listener.
[02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:14.618]  You're a hero of mine.
[02:43:14.678 --> 02:43:21.063]  Now, let me start by saying, growing up and just my whole life, really, I have never understood the purpose of the federal government.
[02:43:21.083 --> 02:43:22.444]  I've never understood why we need it.
[02:43:22.824 --> 02:43:24.966]  I propose to pull the plug on the whole damn thing.
[02:43:25.446 --> 02:43:26.667]  No, I agree.
[02:43:26.747 --> 02:43:28.028]  It's pure cancer at this point.
[02:43:29.161 --> 02:43:29.541]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:29.802 --> 02:43:42.135]  I mean, on your topic of how do we prevent this nuclear war, you know, this group of psychopaths that's bringing us to the brink of total annihilation and death, it scares the hell out of me, Alex.
[02:43:42.215 --> 02:43:44.757]  You know, I'm just a mechanic in Mobile, Alabama.
[02:43:45.198 --> 02:43:50.764]  I don't know a whole lot about government, legislation, politics, but what I do know is machines.
[02:43:51.204 --> 02:44:02.109]  Alex, if you want to shut down a machine, and that's what this is, this group of psychopaths, it's a war machine that's bringing us, that's waging war all over the world, Alex.
[02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:04.930]  And the way you shut down a machine is you shut down the fuel.
[02:44:05.470 --> 02:44:11.333]  And this is something that I listen to a lot of podcasts, I listen to you mainly, Rogan, Tucker, you know, Brand.
[02:44:12.114 --> 02:44:18.041]  I never understood why nobody ever offers this as a solution, but the fuel is our tax dollars.
[02:44:18.421 --> 02:44:23.948]  It makes me sick to my stomach that I'm paying for this death all over the world.
[02:44:24.028 --> 02:44:26.651]  It comes out of my check every... Let me be clear, let me be clear.
[02:44:26.691 --> 02:44:28.353]  They tax you to control you.
[02:44:28.393 --> 02:44:30.095]  They print the money out of nothing, but you're right.
[02:44:30.555 --> 02:44:31.697]  Not complying is the way to go.
[02:44:32.679 --> 02:44:37.083]  Well, I've always felt like a solution, you know, would be to just stop.
[02:44:37.283 --> 02:44:40.646]  We need to stop paying taxes to this war machine that's going all over the country.
[02:44:40.666 --> 02:44:43.508]  Now, like you said, I don't know if that would have an effect or not.
[02:44:43.549 --> 02:44:46.731]  It's very far-fetched to even assume that we could pull something like that off.
[02:44:47.092 --> 02:44:57.721]  But if they can convince more than half the country to put a shot in their arm of something they don't even know what it is that's killing so many people, I'm sure we could convince a group of people large enough to do something that actually makes sense.
[02:44:58.061 --> 02:45:00.322]  So stop funding this death all over the world.
[02:45:00.522 --> 02:45:02.223]  Let's quit paying this federal government.
[02:45:02.263 --> 02:45:05.644]  Let's shut down their fuel, and let's watch this machine turn off.
[02:45:06.245 --> 02:45:06.965]  I agree with you, brother.
[02:45:06.985 --> 02:45:07.645]  Thank you for the call.
[02:45:08.646 --> 02:45:09.886]  Jay in Connecticut.
[02:45:09.906 --> 02:45:10.227]  Go ahead.
[02:45:11.347 --> 02:45:12.367]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:12.548 --> 02:45:16.629]  I just ordered five of those TurboForces from your dad's company.
[02:45:16.709 --> 02:45:17.550]  I couldn't live without it.
[02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:18.410]  Truck driver.
[02:45:18.970 --> 02:45:23.352]  Anyways, I think that, in a lot of ways, I think we're winning the war.
[02:45:25.753 --> 02:45:27.075]  I'm all over the country.
[02:45:27.575 --> 02:45:30.878]  I speak with people and people are awake, waking up.
[02:45:31.679 --> 02:45:33.140]  And young kids even.
[02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:37.904]  I was with a man speaking with him about, you know, the new world order.
[02:45:38.885 --> 02:45:42.888]  But as for stopping the war, it's not a way that you would practice.
[02:45:44.218 --> 02:46:01.543]  But my thoughts would be, as they did with the Iraq War, with the King of Diamonds, or Ace of Spades, and all that, make a Bitcoin account that people pay into, rather than pay their taxes, and go after these people, and take them out!
[02:46:01.663 --> 02:46:03.764]  I mean, make a list!
[02:46:03.804 --> 02:46:08.786]  Have an actual list of all the heads of all these... Hold on, don't hang up, Jay!
[02:46:08.826 --> 02:46:10.026]  Well, that's called war!
[02:46:11.026 --> 02:46:13.147]  And so, yeah, where's our George Washington?
[02:46:14.608 --> 02:46:14.988]  Stay there.
[02:46:16.069 --> 02:46:18.391]  I don't know what I'd do if I saw Fauci walking down the street or Bill Gates.
[02:46:18.471 --> 02:46:21.192]  I mean, he's so outrageously evil.
[02:46:21.633 --> 02:46:23.094]  He's such a murderer!
[02:46:23.574 --> 02:46:29.198]  And we need to have, you know, you're a Christian, you're a father, you're a theologian, you're able to be really calm and nice about this.
[02:46:29.238 --> 02:46:32.640]  I know you're pissed off about it, but the thing is, take action, folks.
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:33.381]  Resist them.
[02:46:33.701 --> 02:46:34.882]  Protect yourself from them.
[02:46:34.982 --> 02:46:35.722]  Expose them.
[02:46:36.543 --> 02:46:39.865]  What do we do biblically, do you think, to just spiritually be able to deal with this?
[02:46:40.936 --> 02:46:43.318]  Well, we can't deal with stuff like this on our own.
[02:46:44.198 --> 02:46:47.021]  You have to lean on God.
[02:46:47.741 --> 02:46:48.281]  You have to.
[02:46:48.341 --> 02:46:52.545]  Because when you look at what He is, He knows the beginning from the end.
[02:46:52.605 --> 02:46:54.526]  He knows everything that we're going through.
[02:46:55.147 --> 02:46:57.949]  In the midst of the storm, He brings peace.
[02:46:58.649 --> 02:47:01.331]  We know how this game ends.
[02:47:01.952 --> 02:47:03.192]  And we know who wins.
[02:47:04.073 --> 02:47:04.273]  Right?
[02:47:04.373 --> 02:47:06.795]  And the Bible tells us every knee must bow.
[02:47:07.155 --> 02:47:10.717]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, the knee of all these things that we're seeing.
[02:47:11.237 --> 02:47:13.538]  And we know what happens to the devil.
[02:47:13.978 --> 02:47:15.619]  Jesus throws him in the pit.
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:16.600]  Right?
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:19.021]  And so we know who wins this.
[02:47:19.121 --> 02:47:20.102]  But here's the thing.
[02:47:21.002 --> 02:47:24.104]  God never told us that this life was going to be easy.
[02:47:24.745 --> 02:47:25.625]  He never told us.
[02:47:25.746 --> 02:47:27.407]  In fact, He told us the opposite.
[02:47:28.007 --> 02:47:31.210]  He said, Jesus said, you know, take up your cross and follow me.
[02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:34.972]  People are going to oppose you for following me.
[02:47:35.473 --> 02:47:36.093]  But you know what?
[02:47:36.233 --> 02:47:41.157]  The end result is going to be better if you follow me than if you don't.
[02:47:41.817 --> 02:48:00.377]  So look at the opposition, take the opposition, but never deviate from that path of following truth and following victory and that strength of God who created the universe, who put all of his creativity in us because we were created in his image.
[02:48:00.757 --> 02:48:21.987]  We have to realize we've got that power of God pulsating through our veins every single day because we're created in His image and when we do that we can have confidence that like what Psalms tells us and we can rest under the shadow of His wings that the enemy will come near our tent but they can't come into it, right?
[02:48:22.027 --> 02:48:37.844]   So look at the enemy they're all slaves Satan always destroys them even before they die we see them betrayed we see them destroyed and we see Billions and billions of dollars spent by the federal government secretly, with just Walgreens and CVS alone, to not prescribe ivermectin.
[02:48:38.204 --> 02:48:42.926]  So all this evil, you wonder why are they not giving people the drugs that they now admit works?
[02:48:43.286 --> 02:48:51.089]  Because they wanted to hurt people, they wanted people fearful, but it took billions to buy them off to do the evil, and the devil has the control of the purse.
[02:48:51.929 --> 02:48:53.872]  He has the power of the earth right now.
[02:48:53.912 --> 02:48:55.314]  He's the god of this world right now.
[02:48:55.535 --> 02:49:02.725]  But it shows every bit of it is mercenaries working against their own self-interest for a little bit of money.
[02:49:04.227 --> 02:49:05.489]  Our firm is just different.
[02:49:05.889 --> 02:49:09.853]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[02:49:10.214 --> 02:49:16.200]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[02:49:16.621 --> 02:49:21.086]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[02:49:21.546 --> 02:49:27.527]   When you sell it back, We take nothing, zero, and whatever the depository prices
[02:49:27.527 --> 02:49:28.966]  are, you get all of it.
[02:49:28.966 --> 02:49:36.247]   See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission,
[02:49:36.247 --> 02:49:41.847]   high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even
[02:49:41.847 --> 02:49:42.647]  broken even.

[02:50:04.584 --> 02:50:23.544]  Final segment ahead of the great Gerald Celente taking over.
[02:50:23.719 --> 02:50:25.321]  Jay, I hear your frustration.
[02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:29.424]  We create like a card deck, like in the Iraq war, we deal with the globalists.
[02:50:29.864 --> 02:50:30.945]  They'll call us terrorists.
[02:50:31.005 --> 02:50:33.127]  It'll turn people we kill into victims.
[02:50:33.867 --> 02:50:35.949]  And it'll, they'll turn it, we've got to destroy their ideas.
[02:50:35.969 --> 02:50:37.330]  We've got to assassinate their names.
[02:50:37.350 --> 02:50:40.412]  We've got to non-violently, politically expose them.
[02:50:43.038 --> 02:50:44.319]  I see where you're going here.
[02:50:44.739 --> 02:50:46.640]  The point is the New World Order is losing.
[02:50:47.141 --> 02:50:49.142]  They want a physical confrontation.
[02:50:49.522 --> 02:50:50.743]  They're claiming it's imminent.
[02:50:51.063 --> 02:50:59.048]  So I would just caution everybody to not be violent, to not be offensive, but to politically murder the ideas of the globalists non-violently.
[02:50:59.068 --> 02:50:59.768]  Does that make sense?
[02:51:00.889 --> 02:51:02.550]  Alex, I listened to that X-22.
[02:51:02.730 --> 02:51:04.271]  It's like the QAnon.
[02:51:04.611 --> 02:51:10.275]  I know it's a bunch of BS, but the bottom line is we need a general like you said.
[02:51:10.715 --> 02:51:12.036]  Trump is not a messiah.
[02:51:13.084 --> 02:51:19.068]  And Flynn, he knows all the generals that are real generals.
[02:51:19.488 --> 02:51:25.051]  Not like these fairies running around in skirts saying that I'm a girl and all that bullshit stuff.
[02:51:25.811 --> 02:51:26.792]  That's a bunch of nonsense.
[02:51:26.832 --> 02:51:29.173]  There are good people in the government, I'm sure.
[02:51:29.593 --> 02:51:31.475]  And yes, the government needs to be reduced.
[02:51:31.715 --> 02:51:36.437]  Yes, I think that taxes are ridiculous, that we're paying for this to support this war.
[02:51:36.938 --> 02:51:39.559]  And yes, they've killed how many people?
[02:51:39.599 --> 02:51:41.000]  We don't know with these shots.
[02:51:42.734 --> 02:51:43.775]  Well, who does the killing then?
[02:51:43.795 --> 02:51:45.377]  I mean, so who do we kill first?
[02:51:45.477 --> 02:51:47.079]  Because I don't want that to happen.
[02:51:47.219 --> 02:51:47.800]  I'm against that.
[02:51:47.679 --> 02:51:50.879]  I'm just yeah I'm frustrated I'm more than frustrated.
[02:51:50.879 --> 02:51:52.879]  Well who does the killing then?
[02:51:52.879 --> 02:51:54.879]  So who do we kill first?
[02:51:54.879 --> 02:51:56.879]  Because I don't want that to happen I'm against that.
[02:51:56.879 --> 02:51:58.879]  We can start talking about this.
[02:51:59.276 --> 02:52:26.963]   I get you're against it, but the bottom line is there are people a lot smarter than you and I that know who these and where these people are, and you make a list, and you put it out on the dark web, and you let the security of these people—I'm having a hard time even calling them—these monsters that are trying to put their We're winning politically and culturally.
[02:52:26.822 --> 02:52:34.102]   Everyone has a price and you hire the security of the people through Bitcoin, it's anonymous.
[02:52:34.102 --> 02:52:37.022]  I contribute to President Trump.
[02:52:37.022 --> 02:52:38.022]  I contribute to the United States.
[02:52:38.022 --> 02:52:39.022]  Alright brother, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:52:39.022 --> 02:52:40.902]  I'm going to tell you this right now.
[02:52:40.902 --> 02:52:43.181]  We're winning politically and culturally.
[02:52:43.181 --> 02:52:52.021]   The last thing we want is Fauci to get killed or any of these people.
[02:52:52.021 --> 02:52:53.262]  Yeah, they're killing us.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.022]  It's a normal response to say, hey, let's do this.
[02:52:56.622 --> 02:52:57.923]  They want violence.
[02:53:00.124 --> 02:53:01.545]  We have to stop violence.
[02:53:02.386 --> 02:53:04.227]  They're trying to start World War III right now.
[02:53:05.168 --> 02:53:07.689]  And I'm not, I understand people are frustrated, they're mad.
[02:53:09.090 --> 02:53:11.732]  But simply put, folks, violence is not the answer.
[02:53:11.752 --> 02:53:16.295]  We need to politically expose the globalists like our lives depend on it because it does.
[02:53:17.011 --> 02:53:18.692]  All right, Gerald Cilente is about to take over.
[02:53:18.732 --> 02:53:20.993]  I'm sorry to Matthew, Nature Boy, and Mark.
[02:53:21.033 --> 02:53:23.775]  If you call me back tomorrow, I will take calls tomorrow.
[02:53:23.795 --> 02:53:25.576]  If we're still on air, then who knows?
[02:53:26.437 --> 02:53:26.737]  11 a.m.
[02:53:26.797 --> 02:53:27.157]  Central.
[02:53:27.177 --> 02:53:34.742]  And for the next hour, Gerald Cilente will take over, the great trends forecaster, and then Owen Troyer, the war room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:34.782 --> 02:53:35.762]  And every day is precious.
[02:53:36.182 --> 02:53:36.843]  Every day is special.
[02:53:36.863 --> 02:53:37.863]  I'm very thankful to the crew.
[02:53:39.384 --> 02:53:41.586]  Very thankful to my family, the audience, keeping us on air.
[02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:54.748]  And I just want to encourage everybody to support our sponsors, but realize the articles, the videos, the clips we put out, that Kim.com interview, the second hour, that's now posted, or about to be posted, at X. Get that.
[02:53:54.928 --> 02:53:58.570]  Share the hell out of it, because that's trying to stop World War III.
[02:53:58.710 --> 02:54:02.673]  Information is 90% of the war.
[02:54:03.433 --> 02:54:06.035]  We have to take care of that first, then we'll worry about the other stuff later.
[02:54:07.536 --> 02:54:09.077]  And sure, we'll prosecute the globalists.
[02:54:09.517 --> 02:54:10.838]  They'll be brought to justice if we win.
[02:54:12.648 --> 02:54:17.670]  We can't be in a position of sitting back saying, let's hire people online to go kill politicians.
[02:54:18.451 --> 02:54:22.173]  I don't think that caller was an FBI agent trying to set us up, but that's where that leads.
[02:54:22.193 --> 02:54:25.354]  They already tried that with Governor Whitmer, January 6th, that's not a good thing.
[02:54:25.774 --> 02:54:27.135]  We have the moral high ground.
[02:54:27.255 --> 02:54:34.959]  So, spread the word about the broadcast, share the articles, share the videos, support the broadcast at drjonesnaturals.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:36.226 --> 02:54:43.035]  And understand that we're going to win this fight at the end of the day together by putting the information out.
[02:54:43.395 --> 02:54:44.436]  They want to censor us.
[02:54:44.456 --> 02:54:49.943]  There's a famous internet saying, the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:54:50.899 --> 02:54:54.120]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was helpless.
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:56.900]  We are winning because we're promoting freedom and justice.
[02:54:57.641 --> 02:54:59.001]  The last thing we want is violence.
[02:54:59.021 --> 02:55:00.061]  I understand people are pissed.
[02:55:00.101 --> 02:55:00.821]  I'm not judging you.
[02:55:01.302 --> 02:55:02.382]  But let's not do that.
[02:55:02.822 --> 02:55:04.362]  Let's exhaust every option first.
[02:55:04.682 --> 02:55:05.403]  We're starting to win.
[02:55:05.723 --> 02:55:06.983]  Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:55:07.003 --> 02:55:07.383]  Stay with us.
[02:55:08.243 --> 02:55:10.384]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:11.364 --> 02:55:13.885]  And it's so sad what's going on.
[02:55:16.285 --> 02:55:23.345]   You know, one of the callers was talking about All our tax money going to the military-industrial complex.
[02:55:24.705 --> 02:55:28.567]  This is an article that's in this week's Trends Journal.
[02:55:30.067 --> 02:55:37.329]  Defense sector hiring at fastest rate since Cold War as order books bulge.
[02:55:38.269 --> 02:55:40.130]  Isn't that nice?
[02:55:41.470 --> 02:55:43.191]  Order books bulge.
[02:55:43.991 --> 02:55:46.792]  The country's rotting in front of our eyes.
[02:55:49.150 --> 02:55:50.731]  I just drove down to the city.
[02:55:50.791 --> 02:55:53.713]  It's about 90 miles where I'm up in Kingston, New York.
[02:55:55.574 --> 02:55:57.275]  The roads are a joke.
[02:55:58.476 --> 02:56:00.117]  The roads are a joke.
[02:56:00.357 --> 02:56:01.938]  Potholes everywhere.
[02:56:02.779 --> 02:56:06.521]  But I'm a little low life piece of scum.
[02:56:07.322 --> 02:56:08.923]  I'm your politician.
[02:56:09.183 --> 02:56:09.804]  You got it?
[02:56:11.064 --> 02:56:11.865]  Get it in your head.
[02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:17.071]  I'm little Mike Johnson, with a pecker about that big!
[02:56:17.551 --> 02:56:19.672]  But an ego, man!
[02:56:22.193 --> 02:56:24.614]  Nothing big enough to put my ego into!
[02:56:24.634 --> 02:56:28.615]  Oh, House of Representatives?
[02:56:29.495 --> 02:56:30.275]  F you!
[02:56:30.756 --> 02:56:32.776]  We don't represent you!
[02:56:34.997 --> 02:56:38.018]  We represent the Military-Industrial Complex.
[02:56:40.299 --> 02:56:41.079]  Both parties.
[02:56:43.783 --> 02:56:49.085]  Yep, Trump is against the Ukraine war, but he's for the Israeli one.
[02:56:52.126 --> 02:56:52.586]  Biden?
[02:56:53.006 --> 02:56:55.467]  Not a war that that guy didn't love.
[02:56:57.047 --> 02:56:57.447]  Peace?
[02:56:58.328 --> 02:56:59.208]  Go to hell!
[02:57:00.968 --> 02:57:01.409]  That's it.
[02:57:01.749 --> 02:57:02.589]  You go to hell.
[02:57:03.069 --> 02:57:05.150]  Because all they have is war.
[02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:06.270]  Hell time.
[02:57:07.150 --> 02:57:09.511]  Run by demonic little freaks.
[02:57:10.331 --> 02:57:12.012]  Demonic little nobodies.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:20.363]  You get blacklisted for coming out for peace.
[02:57:21.184 --> 02:57:35.216]  And you get blacklisted for not swallowing the crap and repeating it like they do the little prostitutes in the mainstream media, media whores that get paid to put out by the corporate pimps and government oil masters.
[02:57:35.837 --> 02:57:37.618]  So what they're doing to Alex Jones?
[02:57:37.638 --> 02:57:40.501]  There's an article.
[02:57:43.343 --> 02:57:44.064]  It just came out.
[02:57:46.647 --> 02:57:47.467]  Let me see if I can find it.
[02:57:47.487 --> 02:57:47.908]  Here we go.
[02:57:48.448 --> 02:57:55.992]  Bankruptcy trustee discloses plan to shut down Alex Jones Info Wars and liquidate assets.
[02:57:56.012 --> 02:57:57.633]  This is from the Canadian press.
[02:57:58.913 --> 02:58:04.176]  And when you read the article, it's Canadian prostitutes.
[02:58:05.697 --> 02:58:11.840]  Little media whores spewing out crap language that you gotta swallow.
[02:58:11.860 --> 02:58:20.634]   If you don't swallow it, And you have no right to be an American or a free thinker.
[02:58:20.654 --> 02:58:26.297]  Because only in America, you got to do what your politicians tell you.
[02:58:27.938 --> 02:58:28.378]  You got it?
[02:58:30.079 --> 02:58:32.680]  All you kids, you're not going to school anymore.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:34.541]  COVID's going to get you.
[02:58:34.841 --> 02:58:36.142]  COVID's going to get you.
[02:58:36.722 --> 02:58:38.563]  Get back in your house, your little house.
[02:58:40.864 --> 02:58:41.665]  Oh, yeah, data.
[02:58:41.725 --> 02:58:43.426]  How about a little data before I go into this?
[02:58:44.645 --> 02:58:44.985]  Look it up.
[02:58:45.306 --> 02:58:45.766]  Google it up.
[02:58:46.606 --> 02:58:52.851]  How many 1-17 year olds died in the United States of COVID between 2000 and 2023?
[02:58:52.911 --> 02:58:54.252]  They stopped doing the numbers in June of 2023.
[02:58:54.312 --> 02:58:54.712]  Look it up.
[02:58:54.732 --> 02:58:56.973]  Out of 73 million 1-17 year olds, less than 2,000 died of COVID.
[02:58:56.792 --> 02:59:05.512]   2023. Look it up. At a 73 million, 1 to 17 years olds, less than 2000 died of COVID.
[02:59:05.512 --> 02:59:17.073]   And according to the CDC, 60% of those hospitalized are obese. You're not allowed to say that.
[02:59:17.073 --> 02:59:27.073]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:22.383]  So here's what they say, and this is how prostitutes sell their crap.
[02:59:24.364 --> 02:59:24.625]  A U.S.
[02:59:24.685 --> 02:59:32.350]  Bankruptcy Court trustee is planning to shut down conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:33.871]  Oh, conspiracy theorist?
[02:59:35.452 --> 02:59:36.793]  Oh, he didn't believe in the COVID war?
[02:59:37.354 --> 02:59:39.255]  Why, you lousy piece of crap.
[02:59:39.575 --> 02:59:41.597]  What the hell's the matter with you, Alex Jones?
[02:59:45.123 --> 02:59:50.525]  As much as I don't like Trump, I believe the election was stolen.
[02:59:51.425 --> 02:59:52.145]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:59:54.526 --> 03:00:00.908]  I did a show that night, election night, in 2020, with Greg Hunt on USA Watchdog.
[03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:05.690]  And he had all the charts out there, all the stuff.
[03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:10.131]  And again, I was on, you know, for most of the night, you know, until way into the AM.
[03:00:14.415 --> 03:00:17.257]  It was Trump on top and Biden following him.
[03:00:18.017 --> 03:00:28.623]  Then all of a sudden, these aren't the exact numbers, but this is right, over 100,000 votes come in for like Michigan or Wisconsin, you know, someplace.
[03:00:30.064 --> 03:00:31.024]  Not one for Trump.
[03:00:31.465 --> 03:00:33.166]  They're all written ballots, right?
[03:00:34.186 --> 03:00:35.167]  Not one for Trump.
[03:00:36.227 --> 03:00:37.348]  What am I, six years old?
[03:00:38.638 --> 03:00:39.799]  What am I still in kindergarten?
[03:00:40.119 --> 03:00:41.540]  Of course you're in kindergarten.
[03:00:41.780 --> 03:00:43.161]  You never got out of kindergarten.
[03:00:43.201 --> 03:00:44.242]  It's the American way.
[03:00:44.482 --> 03:00:46.083]  You listen to your kindergarten teacher.
[03:00:47.324 --> 03:00:49.066]  So I believe the election was stolen.
[03:00:50.406 --> 03:00:51.047]  Unquestionable.
[03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:56.551]  But your conspiracy theorists are saying that.
[03:00:58.872 --> 03:01:00.714]  Totally opposed to the COVID war.
[03:01:02.495 --> 03:01:03.756]  I only write about facts.
[03:01:05.717 --> 03:01:06.478]  And here's the fact.
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:12.622]  The COVID war began in January 2020 on Chinese Lunar New Year.
[03:01:13.462 --> 03:01:14.783]  The year of the rat.
[03:01:15.803 --> 03:01:16.203]  That's right.
[03:01:17.944 --> 03:01:19.524]  Cover your Trends Journal magazine.
[03:01:19.544 --> 03:01:21.265]  Remember, it begins in January.
[03:01:22.105 --> 03:01:23.225]  January 28th.
[03:01:24.566 --> 03:01:25.446]  Cover the magazine.
[03:01:26.086 --> 03:01:26.947]  Coronavirus.
[03:01:26.967 --> 03:01:31.228]  106 dead in China.
[03:01:32.209 --> 03:01:35.130]  Our next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:36.450]  What are you telling me, Scott?
[03:01:38.436 --> 03:01:40.737]  I used to be on Hong Kong TV in 2019.
[03:01:41.077 --> 03:01:57.684]  And I'm doing shows, there were protests going on in China, in Hong Kong, where over a million people were taken to the streets in protest of China taking over.
[03:01:59.185 --> 03:02:07.829]  Because the deal they made when the British left Hong Kong, which I don't like being there anyway, was that for 40 years, Hong Kong would be free to rule itself.
[03:02:08.573 --> 03:02:09.954]  And they backed off that in China.
[03:02:11.595 --> 03:02:15.057]  Going forward, I'm taking a break.
[03:02:15.097 --> 03:02:16.818]  I'm, like, on for 20 minutes on these shows.
[03:02:17.498 --> 03:02:19.339]  And I say to the guy, Frank, so what's happening?
[03:02:19.359 --> 03:02:20.760]  Mr. Salenti, we're not going to stop.
[03:02:21.461 --> 03:02:23.082]  We're not going to let the Chinese take over.
[03:02:24.122 --> 03:02:29.185]  Remember, a million people taking to the streets, over a million out of 7.5 million.
[03:02:29.845 --> 03:02:37.046]   You can't get a million people in the United States out of 336 million to protest.
[03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:44.085]  COVID war happens.
[03:02:44.263 --> 03:02:45.623]  Can't go out and protest anymore.
[03:02:45.643 --> 03:02:47.084]  Get back in your house.
[03:02:47.724 --> 03:02:50.805]  China passes an emergency act, takes over, boom, end of story.
[03:02:53.605 --> 03:02:55.046]  So you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:02:56.866 --> 03:03:07.450]  If you didn't believe in the COVID war, if you looked at the numbers that are showing that 90, about 99.3% of the people are still alive from COVID.
[03:03:08.270 --> 03:03:17.735]   And if you've fell off a ladder and broke your neck, And you took to the hospital and they tested you to positive for COVID.
[03:03:17.755 --> 03:03:18.475]  You died of COVID.
[03:03:18.495 --> 03:03:18.995]  Remember that?
[03:03:20.455 --> 03:03:22.016]  So you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:03:23.696 --> 03:03:24.256]  They go on.
[03:03:25.937 --> 03:03:32.258]  Jones has been saying on his web and radio shows that he expects InfoWars to operate for a few more months.
[03:03:34.178 --> 03:03:35.079]  He doesn't know how long.
[03:03:36.959 --> 03:03:37.979]  But, you ready?
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:44.641]  He has vowed to continue his bombastic broadcasts.
[03:03:45.598 --> 03:03:46.439]  Or bombastic?
[03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:50.101]  Or you don't swallow their crap?
[03:03:51.802 --> 03:04:02.668]  How dare you, Alex Jones, get angry when they're robbing us of our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:07.071]  They have destroyed the world with this COVID war.
[03:04:08.732 --> 03:04:16.967]   Again, week after week, week after week, We're writing about the dangers that happen.
[03:04:17.868 --> 03:04:23.729]  And in this week's Trends Journal, we have another article coming in about how the kids are suffering in school.
[03:04:25.809 --> 03:04:27.169]  And the problems that they're having.
[03:04:28.029 --> 03:04:30.030]  Because they locked them up for a couple of years.
[03:04:34.590 --> 03:04:36.571]  You're not allowed to say anything about that.
[03:04:38.911 --> 03:04:39.691]  Bombastic.
[03:04:40.371 --> 03:04:40.571]  Huh?
[03:04:43.952 --> 03:04:44.092]  Yep.
[03:04:47.694 --> 03:04:49.355]  Anger looks toward the good of justice.
[03:04:52.978 --> 03:04:54.239]  That's according to St.
[03:04:54.279 --> 03:04:55.100]  Thomas Aquinas.
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:05:04.267]  That if you're not angry, when it's morally justifiable to be angry, you are immoral as well as unjust.
[03:05:06.249 --> 03:05:07.349]  You can't get angry.
[03:05:08.590 --> 03:05:10.272]  Oh, you like the Ukraine war?
[03:05:10.592 --> 03:05:10.912]  Huh?
[03:05:12.133 --> 03:05:12.694]  You like it?
[03:05:14.855 --> 03:05:15.696]  Go over there and fight.
[03:05:16.756 --> 03:05:17.396]  Send your money.
[03:05:18.716 --> 03:05:19.396]  Send your wife.
[03:05:19.437 --> 03:05:20.077]  Send your kids.
[03:05:20.137 --> 03:05:21.297]  Send your transgenders.
[03:05:21.617 --> 03:05:22.617]  Put on your costumes.
[03:05:22.677 --> 03:05:23.637]  Go fight and die.
[03:05:24.597 --> 03:05:25.338]  Keep me out of it.
[03:05:28.238 --> 03:05:31.079]  Oh yeah, I like the Israel war better.
[03:05:31.119 --> 03:05:34.699]  It only killed about 40,000 people from Gaza.
[03:05:35.259 --> 03:05:36.640]  70% of them women and children.
[03:05:36.820 --> 03:05:37.660]  Blowing up tents.
[03:05:38.140 --> 03:05:38.840]  Living in tents.
[03:05:38.940 --> 03:05:39.580]  Living in tents.
[03:05:39.860 --> 03:05:40.880]  Their home's been destroyed.
[03:05:42.521 --> 03:05:49.677]   And America's, our tax dollars, Your money going to murder people all over the world.
[03:05:50.937 --> 03:05:52.538]  How dare you come out against this?
[03:05:55.378 --> 03:05:57.779]  A million people marching in China.
[03:05:59.359 --> 03:06:03.920]  We're having a Peace and Freedom Rally up here in Kingston, New York on the Four Corners of Freedom.
[03:06:04.601 --> 03:06:07.741]  John and Crown Street on September 28th.
[03:06:09.002 --> 03:06:22.556]   So far the speakers, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Max Blumenthal.
[03:06:22.576 --> 03:06:24.597]  That's right.
[03:06:28.019 --> 03:06:29.260]  Max Blumenthal is Jewish.
[03:06:31.862 --> 03:06:33.603]  He's against the Israel War.
[03:06:33.623 --> 03:06:36.245]  You can't call me an anti-Semite.
[03:06:37.045 --> 03:06:39.967]  You can't call me anti-American because I'm against America's wars.
[03:06:39.987 --> 03:06:43.529]  In fact, I grew up during World War II.
[03:06:43.549 --> 03:06:49.248]   You couldn't call me as a Paisano, you couldn't call me anti-Italian if I hated Mussolini.
[03:06:50.948 --> 03:06:53.588]  So save your anti-semitic crap and shove it.
[03:06:53.588 --> 03:07:05.668]  Do everything you can to support InfoWise.
[03:07:05.854 --> 03:07:11.396]  Because it's gonna... One after another, they're gonna shut us all down.
[03:07:12.975 --> 03:07:15.256]  Particularly as World War Three heats up.
[03:07:15.316 --> 03:07:16.677]  World War Three's begun.
[03:07:17.418 --> 03:07:22.481]  There's the cover of our Trends Journal magazine on February 22nd, 2022.
[03:07:26.583 --> 03:07:30.005]  Two days before Russia launched the attack into Ukraine.
[03:07:33.047 --> 03:07:34.248]  And now the Israel war.
[03:07:34.268 --> 03:07:37.530]  We're almost finished wiping out Gaza.
[03:07:37.850 --> 03:07:39.691]  Now we're going to go after Hezbollah.
[03:07:40.332 --> 03:07:47.334]   Hezbollah That the prostitutes call terrorist organization.
[03:07:48.755 --> 03:08:02.826]  These are the people, the guys, and women, maybe, that fought against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon.
[03:08:03.026 --> 03:08:04.407]  Threw them out in 2006.
[03:08:05.588 --> 03:08:05.788]  Why?
[03:08:05.848 --> 03:08:06.809]  How dare you?
[03:08:07.489 --> 03:08:09.371]  I forgot maybe God gave you that land.
[03:08:10.638 --> 03:08:12.779]  It's in the good book, you know, it's chapter 6, section 8.
[03:08:12.839 --> 03:08:14.060]  You know, I don't want to hear this stuff.
[03:08:15.281 --> 03:08:16.522]  You make up garbage.
[03:08:16.702 --> 03:08:17.983]  What if I don't believe in your religion?
[03:08:18.003 --> 03:08:18.804]  Can you handle that?
[03:08:19.064 --> 03:08:21.126]  I'm not telling you to believe in mine, so take it easy.
[03:08:23.527 --> 03:08:24.908]  So anyway, that's what's going on.
[03:08:25.389 --> 03:08:29.172]  That's the way they're writing propaganda about Alex Jones.
[03:08:31.213 --> 03:08:34.636]  And that's why you need to do everything you can to support them.
[03:08:36.057 --> 03:08:37.258]  Because they're doing... I'm telling you!
[03:08:38.481 --> 03:08:41.783]  If they're going to take us to war, it's already begun.
[03:08:41.823 --> 03:08:43.283]  There's going to be a false flag of event.
[03:08:44.424 --> 03:08:46.145]  Something that's going to make it, quote, official.
[03:08:49.526 --> 03:08:51.467]  And it just keep ramping it up and ramping it up.
[03:08:53.008 --> 03:09:00.531]  Again, defense sector hiring at fastest rate since Cold War as order books bulge.
[03:09:01.631 --> 03:09:09.372]   Global defense companies recruiting workers at the fastest rate Since the end of the Cold War, which means the hot war has begun.
[03:09:10.012 --> 03:09:11.432]  This is from Financial Times.
[03:09:13.073 --> 03:09:17.394]  A Financial Times survey of the hiring of 20 large and medium-sized U.S.
[03:09:17.894 --> 03:09:25.936]  and European defense and aerospace companies found they are seeking to recruit tens of thousands of people this year.
[03:09:25.956 --> 03:09:28.176]  Three of the largest U.S.
[03:09:28.236 --> 03:09:35.258]  contractors, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics, have close to 6,000 job openings they need to fill.
[03:09:36.078 --> 03:09:40.640]  Well, 10 companies surveyed are seeking to increase positions by only 37,000.
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:47.642]  All right.
[03:09:49.163 --> 03:09:53.104]  So, as I said, it's the military industrial complex.
[03:09:54.309 --> 03:10:09.482]  It's what President Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, two-term president, warned the American people that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of genius scientists, sweat of labor, and the future of the children.
[03:10:10.723 --> 03:10:11.224]  It's gone.
[03:10:11.724 --> 03:10:11.964]  I went.
[03:10:11.984 --> 03:10:13.105]  I went down to the city, you know?
[03:10:14.406 --> 03:10:16.728]  And, uh, I'm a night guy.
[03:10:17.889 --> 03:10:18.830]  I love nighttime.
[03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:20.872]  You know, great jazz town, great jazz clubs.
[03:10:22.173 --> 03:10:25.054]  And walking around West Village, you know, where my buddy lives.
[03:10:26.074 --> 03:10:27.554]  And I used to be down there all the time.
[03:10:28.875 --> 03:10:31.896]  And now, you see guys like this.
[03:10:35.577 --> 03:10:36.217]  In the West Village.
[03:10:36.237 --> 03:10:46.660]  You see guys walking down Broom Street, not far from Mulberry Street, shooting up right in front of you.
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:49.160]  They put all this scaffolding up when they're doing work on buildings.
[03:10:49.801 --> 03:10:51.521]  Homeless people under them.
[03:10:54.121 --> 03:10:55.221]  It wasn't like that before.
[03:10:55.241 --> 03:10:57.322]  It wasn't like that before.
[03:10:57.342 --> 03:11:00.202]  It's the way it is now.
[03:11:03.123 --> 03:11:09.825]  Evil, demonic people are running and ruining this country and other countries.
[03:11:14.186 --> 03:11:19.587]  If we don't stop this, this war is going to continue to escalate.
[03:11:20.547 --> 03:11:22.988]  As they say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:11:25.393 --> 03:11:30.337]  Great Depression, World War II, dot com bust, War on Terror.
[03:11:34.140 --> 03:11:45.628]  We are going to have the worst market crash and the worst global slowdown or decline.
[03:11:46.489 --> 03:11:47.790]  We call it dragflation.
[03:11:51.974 --> 03:11:56.696]  Declining economic growth and rising inflation that we've ever seen in the history of the world.
[03:11:56.756 --> 03:11:58.177]  Again, I talk about it.
[03:11:58.197 --> 03:12:01.318]  Don't want to keep talking about it because I know you don't want to keep hearing about it.
[03:12:04.119 --> 03:12:06.520]  Gal, yesterday, you know, take a Uber.
[03:12:06.881 --> 03:12:09.042]  So I say to the guy, so what's going on down there?
[03:12:09.142 --> 03:12:09.762]  Oh, things are good.
[03:12:10.642 --> 03:12:19.026]  I said, how are the, again, this city, how's the traffic, you know, how's business during a weekday?
[03:12:19.708 --> 03:12:22.570]  Still getting a lot of people coming down the city to work?
[03:12:23.170 --> 03:12:24.571]  Nah, the numbers are way down.
[03:12:25.392 --> 03:12:26.272]  Numbers are way down.
[03:12:26.713 --> 03:12:27.913]  People aren't coming back to work.
[03:12:29.294 --> 03:12:30.955]  Yeah, a lot of vacant buildings.
[03:12:32.196 --> 03:12:33.457]  I said, you seeing any business?
[03:12:33.557 --> 03:12:34.658]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of business.
[03:12:34.798 --> 03:12:36.219]  Particularly the small businesses.
[03:12:36.259 --> 03:12:36.719]  That's right.
[03:12:38.100 --> 03:12:38.860]  The small businesses.
[03:12:40.421 --> 03:12:41.362]  The dry cleaners.
[03:12:42.703 --> 03:12:44.724]  Guys who used to prepare shoes.
[03:12:45.285 --> 03:12:45.985]  Hairdressers.
[03:12:47.186 --> 03:12:48.086]  Delicatessens.
[03:12:48.246 --> 03:12:49.007]  Small restaurants.
[03:12:50.384 --> 03:12:51.145]  You know, I have commuters in.
[03:12:52.646 --> 03:12:54.047]  There's going to be an office building.
[03:12:54.067 --> 03:12:55.929]  The office building bust is already happening.
[03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:57.130]  It's happening.
[03:12:58.931 --> 03:12:59.912]  Barely reported.
[03:13:00.293 --> 03:13:01.093]  They're lying.
[03:13:01.254 --> 03:13:09.981]  They're faking the numbers with bonds that are coming from companies that have already defaulted on their office buildings.
[03:13:10.742 --> 03:13:12.063]  And they're saying they're not negative.
[03:13:13.704 --> 03:13:16.607]  There's an article in the Financial Times just today about it.
[03:13:18.444 --> 03:13:21.165]  There's going to be defaults because you have less tenants.
[03:13:23.406 --> 03:13:29.948]  Light leases are coming up and they're not renewing them for the spaces that they have.
[03:13:31.188 --> 03:13:39.951]  You have an office vacancy rate, again, depending on whose numbers that you're looking at, on average in the United States, it was according to Fitch, around 20%.
[03:13:39.991 --> 03:13:41.872]  Fake it!
[03:13:41.932 --> 03:13:44.352]  How the hell are you going to pay?
[03:13:44.372 --> 03:13:46.273]  How are you going to pay your loan?
[03:13:47.085 --> 03:13:49.026]  Oh, that loan you got that's interest-based.
[03:13:50.608 --> 03:13:54.671]  And when you got the loan, the interest was half the rate it is now.
[03:13:56.612 --> 03:13:58.093]  And then the banks are gonna go bust.
[03:13:59.274 --> 03:14:00.635]  Because, well, the defaults.
[03:14:01.736 --> 03:14:03.657]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:14:03.677 --> 03:14:07.460]  They're gonna take us to war.
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:08.861]  They're war hordes.
[03:14:09.161 --> 03:14:10.102]  Who's your favorite one?
[03:14:10.122 --> 03:14:12.704]  Hey, how about little Lindsey Graham, huh?
[03:14:14.178 --> 03:14:16.840]  Lindsey, did you come out of the closet yet, Graham-o, that guy?
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:18.501]  Oh, a real fighter, huh?
[03:14:20.162 --> 03:14:21.562]  Oh, I'm Tom Cottonmouth!
[03:14:21.643 --> 03:14:22.463]  I'm a real guy!
[03:14:22.583 --> 03:14:23.444]  I love to fight!
[03:14:23.464 --> 03:14:24.704]  Go over there and fight!
[03:14:26.505 --> 03:14:27.446]  I'm an American!
[03:14:30.528 --> 03:14:36.211]  I, Gerald Cilenti, am a true American that looks up to the Founding Fathers.
[03:14:37.752 --> 03:14:40.574]  Like George Washington, that Alex Jones just mentioned.
[03:14:41.761 --> 03:14:43.843]  Don't get involved in any foreign entanglements.
[03:14:44.703 --> 03:14:47.506]  Have no love for a country, no hate for a country.
[03:14:47.926 --> 03:14:49.627]  Yeah, either you become a slave to that.
[03:14:50.408 --> 03:14:54.411]  This crap has been going on for thousands of years, and we're not going to fix it.
[03:14:55.092 --> 03:14:56.173]  Oh, yes, we will!
[03:14:56.673 --> 03:15:00.096]  Didn't we do a great job in the Vietnam War?
[03:15:00.896 --> 03:15:01.597]  No, no.
[03:15:01.917 --> 03:15:06.021]  The first Iraq War was much better than the second Iraq War.
[03:15:06.501 --> 03:15:10.344]  And how about that victory over there in Afghanistan?
[03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:18.863]  Oh, bombastic language that I use in Alex Jones.
[03:15:19.203 --> 03:15:20.304]  You have to be proper.
[03:15:20.484 --> 03:15:26.007]  You have to speak like the Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama.
[03:15:26.467 --> 03:15:28.568]  O-B-O-M-B-A.
[03:15:29.089 --> 03:15:30.950]  Quoted in the book Double Down.
[03:15:31.690 --> 03:15:32.971]  I'm really good at killing people.
[03:15:34.892 --> 03:15:38.594]  I want that guy Kaddafi out.
[03:15:40.299 --> 03:15:41.760]  Libya is one of the richest countries.
[03:15:42.241 --> 03:15:43.982]  It is the richest country in Africa.
[03:15:44.462 --> 03:15:46.644]  People have more rights and benefits than most of the world.
[03:15:46.664 --> 03:15:47.905]  I want Amani.
[03:15:47.985 --> 03:15:48.685]  We want the oil.
[03:15:50.046 --> 03:15:51.468]  Get rid of Assad.
[03:15:51.608 --> 03:15:54.029]  We got to steal their oil from East Syria.
[03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.890]  We're still doing it.
[03:15:56.211 --> 03:16:00.214]  Like I say, you think we would have invaded Iraq if their major export was broccoli?
[03:16:00.594 --> 03:16:02.196]  So you have to be proper when you speak.
[03:16:02.896 --> 03:16:05.118]  You have to have your teleprompter in front of you.
[03:16:05.678 --> 03:16:06.439]  Speak properly.
[03:16:06.759 --> 03:16:08.080]  Obama was always folks.
[03:16:08.641 --> 03:16:11.659]   We need to Assad has to go, folks.
[03:16:12.879 --> 03:16:13.699]  Qaddafi has to go.
[03:16:13.879 --> 03:16:17.360]  He was always poking us, folks, folks.
[03:16:20.001 --> 03:16:20.781]  These aren't men.
[03:16:20.801 --> 03:16:23.382]  They're not men.
[03:16:24.102 --> 03:16:25.162]  None of them are fighters.
[03:16:25.182 --> 03:16:26.643]  They're freaks.
[03:16:27.783 --> 03:16:28.883]  It's a freak show.
[03:16:30.784 --> 03:16:31.344]  All to see.
[03:16:33.832 --> 03:16:39.773]  Oh, and also, as much as I don't like Trump, totally opposed to what they did with this bringing him up on charges.
[03:16:40.113 --> 03:16:42.033]  Bring little Georgie Bush up on charges.
[03:16:42.554 --> 03:16:44.794]  Totally opposed to bringing Alex Jones.
[03:16:45.394 --> 03:16:47.374]  How about George Bush for lying us into the war?
[03:16:48.074 --> 03:16:48.555]  How about that?
[03:16:50.075 --> 03:16:58.576]  And I said from the beginning, again, Trends Journal, we say what's out there and we give our analysis, you know, we're not skewing anything.
[03:16:59.236 --> 03:17:01.557]  They made up Russiagate against Trump.
[03:17:01.577 --> 03:17:02.577]  We said it from the beginning.
[03:17:04.775 --> 03:17:06.616]  It's a crime syndicate running the country.
[03:17:07.537 --> 03:17:08.497]  I don't want either party.
[03:17:09.678 --> 03:17:10.518]  It's a freak show.
[03:17:11.058 --> 03:17:12.279]  Again, look at them.
[03:17:15.061 --> 03:17:16.582]  I'm little Chuckie Schumer.
[03:17:17.202 --> 03:17:18.443]  Little Chuckie Schumer.
[03:17:19.883 --> 03:17:20.724]  I'm AOC.
[03:17:21.684 --> 03:17:21.864]  Yeah.
[03:17:23.645 --> 03:17:24.126]  Freak show.
[03:17:25.707 --> 03:17:27.267]  So, we're gonna take a break.
[03:17:28.488 --> 03:17:32.150]  Remember, go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:17:38.115 --> 03:17:42.834]   When we came out with Nitric Boost three years ago, it was a sleeper product, I didn't even promote it.
[03:17:42.834 --> 03:17:47.195]   But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products
[03:17:47.195 --> 03:17:49.355]  because of the incredible results they get.
[03:17:49.355 --> 03:17:54.514]   If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you wanna go in and help clean out

[03:18:07.482 --> 03:18:10.565]  Like, but you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:18:10.585 --> 03:18:12.427]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:18:12.747 --> 03:18:19.613]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably, I hate to brag, it's actually shameful, probably 150 women or more.
[03:18:19.933 --> 03:18:20.554]  That's conservative.
[03:18:20.894 --> 03:18:22.595]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[03:18:22.655 --> 03:18:23.856]  It's great for women as well.

[03:18:41.248 --> 03:18:42.449]  The fall of America.
[03:18:43.730 --> 03:18:46.692]  Biden falling down in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:18:47.913 --> 03:18:48.153]  Yep.
[03:18:49.554 --> 03:18:49.934]  A joke.
[03:18:50.723 --> 03:18:51.083]  A joke.
[03:18:52.564 --> 03:18:54.364]  Again, it's the Obama administration.
[03:18:54.684 --> 03:18:55.204]  Never left.
[03:18:56.245 --> 03:18:57.105]  They're running the show.
[03:18:58.825 --> 03:19:11.349]  And, uh, yeah, there's a guess whether or not Biden will be running for office and they're going to replace him with somebody like that son, Gavin Newsom, the arrogant little boy.
[03:19:11.729 --> 03:19:15.630]  It was a nephew of somebody related to Pelosi.
[03:19:15.650 --> 03:19:18.651]  His daddy was a lawyer for the Giddy Gang.
[03:19:21.152 --> 03:19:22.332]  Put someone like him in there.
[03:19:23.553 --> 03:19:30.355]  And someone like him could win, even though he's an arrogant, narcissistic, lying little boy.
[03:19:30.756 --> 03:19:31.616]  Yeah, a little liar.
[03:19:32.336 --> 03:19:35.798]  The guy that went to the French Laundry when he locked down everybody to party.
[03:19:36.758 --> 03:19:36.958]  Yeah.
[03:19:39.979 --> 03:19:42.420]  Bucks from $400 a plate or something at this place.
[03:19:43.080 --> 03:19:45.141]  Yeah.
[03:19:45.501 --> 03:19:51.416]   If he runs as a Democrat, He'll win.
[03:19:51.997 --> 03:19:52.957]  That's our forecast.
[03:19:54.338 --> 03:20:00.261]  Because when you look at the polls, the numbers against Trump and the numbers against Biden are high.
[03:20:00.281 --> 03:20:02.322]  Highest like in 30 years.
[03:20:04.363 --> 03:20:15.088]  And there's so many people that don't like Trump that they'll go out to vote that they wouldn't have voted to get him out of there.
[03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:24.016]   The other issue is Biden may run because As Alex was just doing with the interview.

[03:20:55.691 --> 03:20:56.312]  World War II.
[03:20:57.633 --> 03:21:03.497]  And to go to history today, just go to Google and put, Franklin Roosevelt seizes Japanese assets.
[03:21:04.598 --> 03:21:07.540]  On 19 July, they bombed in December.
[03:21:09.982 --> 03:21:13.124]  Franklin Roosevelt seized all Japanese assets in retaliation.
[03:21:15.126 --> 03:21:18.148]  Those dirty Japanese attacking French Indochina.
[03:21:19.594 --> 03:21:20.975]  Remember the French Foreign Legion?
[03:21:23.157 --> 03:21:26.540]  Yeah, what the hell are the French doing in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos?
[03:21:26.580 --> 03:21:29.663]  We're stealing their rubber, their tin, rape, pillage.
[03:21:30.103 --> 03:21:31.584]  How dare the Japanese come there?
[03:21:33.446 --> 03:21:37.690]  And those dirty Japanese took over Cameron Air Force Base in Vietnam.
[03:21:37.710 --> 03:21:39.011]  This again, this is history today.
[03:21:41.052 --> 03:21:44.676]  Which is only 800 miles from America's bases in the Philippines.
[03:21:44.976 --> 03:21:46.157]  What the hell are we doing in the Philippines?
[03:21:47.279 --> 03:21:48.479]  Oh, you're an isolationist.
[03:21:48.519 --> 03:21:49.200]  No, I'm not!
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:50.760]  I'm an American!
[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:52.261]  I'm a fighter!
[03:21:53.681 --> 03:21:55.282]  I only attack the attacker.
[03:21:56.362 --> 03:21:56.642]  Got it?
[03:21:58.322 --> 03:22:02.444]  In the American spirit of the Founding Fathers, you don't go attack anybody else.
[03:22:03.144 --> 03:22:04.704]  Oh, they were gonna come after me, I think.
[03:22:06.005 --> 03:22:06.925]  Oh, those dirty Japs?
[03:22:07.685 --> 03:22:07.845]  Yep.
[03:22:08.726 --> 03:22:17.643]   They were also close to the English, who were seizing Singapore.
[03:22:18.603 --> 03:22:19.324]  What the hell are the English?
[03:22:19.404 --> 03:22:21.144]  Oh, the sun never sets on the British Empire.
[03:22:22.124 --> 03:22:23.124]  We're all over the world.
[03:22:23.164 --> 03:22:27.985]  We're still in war, but... Selenki, you have to speak properly.
[03:22:28.666 --> 03:22:35.287]  We know how to speak properly so that morons and idiots suck up our crap.
[03:22:35.707 --> 03:22:37.667]  We have nobility.
[03:22:37.687 --> 03:22:38.508]  Yeah!
[03:22:38.528 --> 03:22:41.328]  A mafia!
[03:22:42.448 --> 03:22:44.729]  A mafia that they call nobility!
[03:22:46.448 --> 03:22:47.769]  Murderers and thieves!
[03:22:48.909 --> 03:22:50.410]  Multi-billionaires!
[03:22:51.010 --> 03:22:53.311]  Killing people all over the world!
[03:22:54.051 --> 03:22:56.813]  Oh, no, Celenti, they're kings!
[03:22:57.333 --> 03:22:58.754]  They're queens!
[03:22:59.234 --> 03:23:01.755]  They don't pee and they don't poo!
[03:23:06.397 --> 03:23:06.637]  Yep.
[03:23:08.918 --> 03:23:09.939]  That's what's going on.
[03:23:11.479 --> 03:23:12.820]  World War III.
[03:23:15.322 --> 03:23:16.823]  It has begun.
[03:23:16.843 --> 03:23:20.084]  And if we don't stop it, it's over.
[03:23:20.624 --> 03:23:25.626]  And they're going to blacklist everybody they can that comes out for peace.
[03:23:29.488 --> 03:23:36.351]  And by the way, I'm going to talk a lot about and a lot about when we have time to talk about what's going on in the markets.
[03:23:38.351 --> 03:23:38.571]  Here.
[03:23:41.293 --> 03:23:44.754]  AAP, Associated Press, Associated Prestitutes.
[03:23:45.487 --> 03:23:53.288]  Neil Farage, leader of Reform UK, criticized the saying West provoked Putin to invade Ukraine.
[03:23:56.189 --> 03:24:04.790]  Facing wide-ranging criticism across the political spectrum over his claim that the West provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.
[03:24:09.431 --> 03:24:13.452]  Neil Farage parroting Putin's lies on Ukraine.
[03:24:14.281 --> 03:24:15.541]  Says Boris Johnson.
[03:24:16.162 --> 03:24:17.602]  Says Boris Johnson.
[03:24:18.423 --> 03:24:19.963]  Some little clown boy.
[03:24:19.983 --> 03:24:29.087]  A little freaky little nothing that the best cartoonist in the world couldn't come up with a better clown looking figure than that little slimeball.
[03:24:30.707 --> 03:24:56.425]   There's a little jerk off over there in Britain that went to the UK, to Ukraine, and talked him out with the influence of the United States To abide by a peace program that was agreed to by Russia in Turkey and tell them not to do it.
[03:24:58.747 --> 03:24:59.808]  That's Boris Johnson.
[03:25:01.869 --> 03:25:02.950]  And this is the way they write it.
[03:25:05.051 --> 03:25:18.268]   Neil Farage sparked a wave of criticism over the weekend when he said, quote, Every eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union provoked Vladimir Putin to launch his full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
[03:25:19.689 --> 03:25:43.168]   The words from the reform party, reform, imbecile party, reform party, anyway, are in a stinging rebuke, excuse me, I meant this the other way around, from Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister and staunch supporter of Ukraine, who in turn has been branded A liar and a hypocrite by Farage.
[03:25:43.208 --> 03:25:43.728]  And he's great.
[03:25:43.748 --> 03:25:44.188]  He's true.
[03:25:44.968 --> 03:25:48.610]  Despite condemnations from both Tory Prime Minister Sunak.
[03:25:49.410 --> 03:25:50.190]  Prime Minister.
[03:25:50.551 --> 03:25:51.851]  Prime piece of crap.
[03:25:54.412 --> 03:25:56.373]  Prime Minister, roll out the red carpet!
[03:25:56.853 --> 03:25:58.094]  Roll out the red carpet!
[03:25:59.234 --> 03:26:00.554]  What a bunch of crap this is.
[03:26:00.574 --> 03:26:07.197]  Every time these clowns get here, everybody's saluting you to walk on a red carpet.
[03:26:07.357 --> 03:26:08.818]  Sunak and Labour leader.
[03:26:09.098 --> 03:26:09.758]  Another jerk.
[03:26:10.626 --> 03:26:15.907]  Starmer over the weekend, Farage doubled down on Sunday, they were criticized by both of them.
[03:26:16.368 --> 03:26:23.009]  He said he was not and never has been an apologist or supporter of Putin.
[03:26:24.310 --> 03:26:25.210]  Exactly what I say.
[03:26:26.310 --> 03:26:33.152]  Describing the thing is entirely wrong to invade Ukraine, which I say, but I understand why.
[03:26:34.952 --> 03:26:42.761]   What I have been saying for the past 10 years Is that the West has played into Putin's hand, giving him an excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.
[03:26:45.443 --> 03:26:46.584]  And here's your Trends Journal.
[03:26:48.646 --> 03:26:54.711]  Ten years ago.
[03:26:54.731 --> 03:26:54.711]  2024.
[03:26:55.411 --> 03:26:58.354]  Spring edition, when it used to be a quarterly.
[03:26:59.194 --> 03:27:01.556]  It's a weekly now, over 200 pages a week.
[03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:05.059]  Washington is driving the world to the final war.
[03:27:06.582 --> 03:27:13.204]  Ukraine presented the perfect opportunity in a speech the National Press called last December.
[03:27:13.224 --> 03:27:23.708]  Assistant Trustee Victoria Nuland boasted that Washington invested $5 billion in non-governmental organizations and NGOs in Ukraine for the purpose to teach democracy.
[03:27:24.448 --> 03:27:31.530]  Article by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts of the United States overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.
[03:27:32.871 --> 03:27:34.792]  But you're condemned by the mainstream media.
[03:27:34.852 --> 03:27:35.952]  That's why I'm mentioning this.
[03:27:37.779 --> 03:27:39.500]  You are not allowed to speak the truth.
[03:27:39.540 --> 03:27:45.604]  You're only allowed to believe their lies and to go to war.
[03:27:47.985 --> 03:27:52.908]  I'm telling you, World War III has begun.
[03:27:54.409 --> 03:27:59.993]  Biden will become president again if World War III becomes a reality.
[03:28:00.635 --> 03:28:02.275]  Unless it will be if we don't stop it.
[03:28:02.655 --> 03:28:04.976]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:05.596 --> 03:28:08.237]  As I said, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:28:08.917 --> 03:28:11.537]  We need to keep the spirit of truth alive.
[03:28:12.437 --> 03:28:16.558]  And the prostitute language that they use, a conspiracy theorist.
[03:28:17.258 --> 03:28:33.006]   Oh, if you're against getting the COVID jab, the first gene therapy inoculation ever injected into a human body, quote, Operation Warp Speed, and you don't want to get it, You're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:28:34.306 --> 03:29:03.018]   If you don't swallow the crap being shoved down your throat by the military-industrial complex, and this is who runs the country, the military-industrial complex, the banks, the bandits, the drug dealers, the morons and imbeciles called Big Pharma, and the geeks, high-tech, AI, we own you, we could go on and on.
[03:29:03.679 --> 03:29:09.844]  As I said, they got it wrong when they said in the King James Bible, the meek shall inherit the earth.
[03:29:09.864 --> 03:29:13.267]  They misspelled it, the geeks have inherited the earth.
[03:29:14.988 --> 03:29:18.732]  So going back, that's who's running the show.
[03:29:22.115 --> 03:29:28.100]  And if you don't swallow their crap, you believe in misinformation, and if you're angry about it, you're bombastic.
[03:29:29.013 --> 03:29:35.237]  So you need to support InfoWars because we are at a very crucial time in American history.
[03:29:35.297 --> 03:29:36.658]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:29:37.218 --> 03:29:39.079]  I'm at this for 44 years.
[03:29:39.519 --> 03:29:44.763]  Best-selling books, Trends 2000, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:29:46.063 --> 03:29:47.484]  And again, talking about the COVID war.
[03:29:49.605 --> 03:29:51.286]  Natural Healing, first book I worked on, 1980s.
[03:29:51.487 --> 03:29:58.571]  They never said a word about getting healthy, building up your immune system, only getting the drugs.
[03:29:59.736 --> 03:30:01.817]  So that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:30:02.337 --> 03:30:04.278]  And they got this great sale right now.
[03:30:04.638 --> 03:30:07.640]  And this is a very crucial time, not only for InfoWars, but for you.
[03:30:08.260 --> 03:30:09.821]  You're killing us in a thousand ways.
[03:30:09.841 --> 03:30:11.542]  You like those GMOs?
[03:30:12.162 --> 03:30:13.663]  How about those, all that other crap?
[03:30:14.143 --> 03:30:15.463]  The artificial flavors?
[03:30:15.503 --> 03:30:16.904]  Not like artificial covers.
[03:30:17.344 --> 03:30:17.724]  Colors.
[03:30:18.065 --> 03:30:19.645]  How about all that synthetic sugar?
[03:30:20.046 --> 03:30:24.007]  How about when you're getting killed so many different ways by the crap that they're shoving?
[03:30:24.308 --> 03:30:27.249]  Oh, how about that, that train derailment?
[03:30:27.639 --> 03:30:31.301]  That happened in East Palestine, Ohio.
[03:30:31.981 --> 03:30:34.222]  Now they say it's spread to 16 states.
[03:30:35.643 --> 03:30:37.724]  So you need to build up your immune system.
[03:30:38.204 --> 03:30:40.605]  And they have these great products that are on sale now.
[03:30:40.645 --> 03:30:42.206]  There's Summer Kickoff Super Sale.

[03:30:52.790 --> 03:30:53.791]  We're in a critical time.
[03:30:54.392 --> 03:31:00.296]  You need to be in the best shape you can physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and you want to boost up your natural system.
[03:31:01.277 --> 03:31:06.281]  And you need to get these essential vitamins and minerals and nutrients.
[03:31:06.721 --> 03:31:07.382]  You need them now.
[03:31:08.362 --> 03:31:16.008]  And in this time of need, it's especially crucial that we're giving our bodies what they need to function at optimum health.

[03:31:42.238 --> 03:31:43.819]  So there's never been a more crucial time.
[03:31:44.419 --> 03:31:47.160]  We have to stand up and fight for our Republic.
[03:31:48.421 --> 03:31:50.522]  And the globalist censorship is real.
[03:31:50.902 --> 03:31:51.782]  The attacks are real.
[03:31:51.802 --> 03:31:52.963]  They were at an all-time high.
[03:31:53.923 --> 03:32:06.425]  And they want to rob us of our life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and what they used to call amendments that don't exist anymore.
[03:32:07.085 --> 03:32:07.886]  Freedom of speech?
[03:32:08.106 --> 03:32:08.466]  F you!
[03:32:08.566 --> 03:32:10.766]  What the hell are you talking about, freedom of speech?
[03:32:14.327 --> 03:32:17.507]  Again, if you don't swallow my crap, I'm the governor of New York.
[03:32:17.627 --> 03:32:18.968]  I'm Andy Cuomo.
[03:32:19.308 --> 03:32:20.828]  My daddy was Mario!
[03:32:22.265 --> 03:32:25.886]  I'm Little True Dope up there in Canada!
[03:32:26.166 --> 03:32:27.466]  My daddy was Pierre!
[03:32:27.486 --> 03:32:29.247]  Or was it Fidel Castro?
[03:32:29.267 --> 03:32:30.147]  I'm not too sure.
[03:32:31.207 --> 03:32:32.367]  Anyway, it's a freak show.
[03:32:33.688 --> 03:32:34.548]  And we gotta unite.
[03:32:35.948 --> 03:32:41.050]  And again, I'm doing everything I can, as Alex Jones and the InfoWars staff is.
[03:32:41.250 --> 03:32:44.710]  And again, I'm having a... We want a million-person march.
[03:32:44.750 --> 03:32:45.791]  That's Scott Ritter.
[03:32:45.931 --> 03:32:46.811]  From Scott Ritter.
[03:32:47.891 --> 03:32:50.772]  I had dinner with him and Judge Napolitano two weeks ago.
[03:32:52.444 --> 03:32:57.087]  And Ritter, Napolitano, Blumenthal will be speakers here.
[03:32:57.728 --> 03:33:00.830]  And Scott Ritter said we need a million person march.
[03:33:02.551 --> 03:33:06.954]  We need a million person march to make this real and we have to keep it going.
[03:33:07.675 --> 03:33:12.719]  I'm going to go through this quickly because I want to get into the economics.
[03:33:13.039 --> 03:33:17.462]  And again, if you want to get to Trends Journal, you go to TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:33:18.140 --> 03:33:21.462]  You put in Jones Trends and you get 10% off.
[03:33:21.522 --> 03:33:22.263]  It's only $2.50 a week.
[03:33:22.643 --> 03:33:25.225]  You get all the economic and geopolitical data you need.
[03:33:25.825 --> 03:33:30.128]  But again, it's at a crucial time.
[03:33:31.809 --> 03:33:40.934]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[03:33:44.457 --> 03:33:45.878]  That was brought to you by the head of the CIA.
[03:33:48.055 --> 03:33:49.355]  William J. Casey.
[03:33:52.696 --> 03:34:12.039]  So, without my going on into the other things, what I really want to talk about is the coming economic crisis and what to do to consider prevailing, preparing, and prospering.
[03:34:13.060 --> 03:34:14.600]  Again, we don't give financial advice.
[03:34:16.041 --> 03:34:18.563]  When you read a trends journal, we tell you this is what they're reporting.
[03:34:20.624 --> 03:34:22.505]  This is our analysis.
[03:34:23.266 --> 03:34:24.527]  And this is where we see it going.
[03:34:25.047 --> 03:34:26.368]  So you know there's no propaganda.
[03:34:28.689 --> 03:34:32.512]  Critics question ratings of dirty dozen bond deals.
[03:34:32.572 --> 03:34:33.373]  Isn't that a nice name?
[03:34:34.693 --> 03:34:36.675]  This is from the Financial Times today.
[03:34:37.996 --> 03:34:58.354]   Credit agencies have misrated more than $100 billion of commercial real estate debt In an increasingly popular segment of the market, say mortgage veterans, including at least a dozen deals that maintain, you ready?
[03:34:59.595 --> 03:35:08.302]  Top investment grade ratings, even though the borrowers are in default.
[03:35:08.322 --> 03:35:12.286]  All right.
[03:35:16.233 --> 03:35:20.313]   The questionable rates are cropping up in a portion of the mortgage bond market
[03:35:20.313 --> 03:35:28.592]   that has evolved in the past decade or so, in which deals are backed by one loan or mortgage on a
[03:35:28.592 --> 03:35:38.313]   single office building rather than a bundle of multiple properties.
[03:35:38.313 --> 03:35:53.992]   One of those deals is 1407 Broadway, a 48-story tower in New York City's garment district
[03:35:53.992 --> 03:35:57.513]  that is facing foreclosure.
[03:35:57.741 --> 03:36:18.803]   The owner of San Francisco-based Shorenstein Properties has not made payments since July on the mortgage for the building, which is no longer generating enough rent to cover its expenses And interest payments.
[03:36:21.704 --> 03:36:30.906]  Nonetheless, $187 million in bonds tied to the building debt are still at double A by Fitch.
[03:36:31.847 --> 03:36:44.990]  A rating agency says it's reserved for borrowers with, quote, very high credit quality and debt with low risk of defaults.
[03:36:47.481 --> 03:36:49.462]  Again, they're defaulting on their loan.
[03:36:50.303 --> 03:36:51.824]  This is hardly being reported.
[03:36:53.565 --> 03:36:53.785]  So.
[03:36:57.647 --> 03:37:05.692]  The markets are being driven up artificially by this Nvidia and the other magnificent seven.
[03:37:06.553 --> 03:37:09.154]  The Russell 2000s down, small businesses.
[03:37:10.195 --> 03:37:15.498]  When you look at the S&P without these, it's, you know, it's up, but this is what's driving it up.
[03:37:16.701 --> 03:37:18.182]  We don't give financial advice.
[03:37:19.923 --> 03:37:25.307]  To me, the number one safe haven asset is gold.
[03:37:26.728 --> 03:37:30.730]  Bitcoin took a hit last couple of days, last week or so.
[03:37:32.431 --> 03:37:33.392]  Down a little bit under $60,000.
[03:37:33.432 --> 03:37:41.137]  I said from the beginning, it's a gambler's game in Bitcoin, but I gamble with that one.
[03:37:42.198 --> 03:37:43.499]  Some people go to the casino.
[03:37:44.259 --> 03:37:45.520]  Gold to me is not a gamble.
[03:37:46.607 --> 03:37:49.068]  Bitcoin's a gamble, but I still gamble in it.
[03:37:51.548 --> 03:37:53.889]  What we're saying is prepare for the worst.
[03:37:56.009 --> 03:37:56.970]  The worst is coming.
[03:37:57.790 --> 03:38:00.311]  If it doesn't come and you prepare for the worst, you lose nothing.
[03:38:00.951 --> 03:38:04.452]  If you don't prepare for the worst and the worst comes, you could lose everything.
[03:38:05.912 --> 03:38:10.253]  And by the way, again, I want to make this clear.
[03:38:10.833 --> 03:38:13.034]  Do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:38:13.507 --> 03:38:18.007]  Because InfoWars and the crew and Alex Jones are doing everything they can to support you.
[03:38:18.852 --> 03:38:24.194]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[03:38:24.694 --> 03:38:26.354]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[03:38:26.875 --> 03:38:35.517]  Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up, and they smash the bones and guts of the fish, and it gets contaminants in it.
[03:38:36.097 --> 03:38:47.341]  We sell the highest grade fish oil there is, and it's pure fish oil, and it's not been pasteurized, and it is so good for your whole body, your cardiovascular system, your brain, energy, everything.
