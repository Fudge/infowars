[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.901]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:12.584]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:34.248]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:45.272]  If you think the awakening we've seen so far is big, this planet and the globalists have not seen anything yet!
[00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:51.854]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.235]  Google is evil.
[00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.304]  We now take the challenge, not to censor like you do, but to stand against you and to fight even harder for our birthright that you are trying to steal!
[00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:07.345]  Remember this.
[00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:14.048]  You killed your profession by becoming nothing but mercenaries for the globalists, and people know that you're fake news, many of you.
[00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:18.030]  Now, with you trying to kill the First Amendment, you're making yourself true villains.
[00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.291]  You've declared war on the First Amendment!
[00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:22.852]  You've declared war on free speech!
[00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:23.373]  Since when
[00:01:24.193 --> 00:01:28.777]  There are hundreds of doctors unable to have press conferences in America.
[00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:32.880]  They take it off YouTube, they take it off Google, they take it off Twitter, they take it off Facebook.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:43.528]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other, just like communist China.
[00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:44.989]  I'm here to expose this fraud.
[00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.870]  I'm here.
[00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.731]  Just like in Congress, that hearing's not me.
[00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.432]  I go there.
[00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:52.068]  And I get in their face and I expose the truth and that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:54.951]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple.
[00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:57.254]  That was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[00:01:57.295 --> 00:01:58.276]  Those were all banned.
[00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:01.901]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.331]  Um, hello everybody.
[00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.552]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show Live Edition.
[00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:20.694]  It is today, Friday, August 9th, 2024.
[00:02:21.154 --> 00:02:23.295]  I'm Laura Logan and I'm filling in for Alex.
[00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.896]  Not quite sure how he got me to do this, but here I am.
[00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:30.417]  Uh, he's got some business to take care of regarding the show.
[00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:32.138]  Um, and so, uh,
[00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:35.620]  I am going to try and fill his shoes today.
[00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:40.885]  It'll be a little different from what it is normally, but hopefully I won't let you down.
[00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:50.472]  Okay, we're going to start today's show with a story that hit social media and it's been reported in the Wall Street Journal and all over the media today.
[00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:56.838]  We confirmed the details with the Butler Police Department because this video that is out is quite
[00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:01.260]  Significant and we're going to play it here for you in a moment.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.681]  Do we have that video ready to roll?
[00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:14.308]  If we do, we'll show you what we're talking about and then we're going to bring in a great guest who is a sniper instructor for Green Berets at their training school.
[00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:23.693]  He spent many years in special operations and then he went into the civilian world where he's been working with law enforcement and training people in
[00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:24.614]  Next building over!
[00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:47.346]  Right after the gap, he's got glasses, long hair.
[00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:50.969]  This building, he was on top of this building, the left one.
[00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.090]  I jumped up.
[00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.316]  The first one, that one, laying down.
[00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:02.858]  There's a gap in between you and there.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.121]  Yo Tess, you got me up once, get me up again.
[00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:21.296]  Okay, we have a short break, one minute break coming up and we'll bring you more of that video and our conversation with Jack Neville's right afterwards.
[00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:25.898]  Don't pop your head, he's right there!
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.401]  This close bro, do we turn around or me?
[00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:33.242]  He's straight up!
[00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:45.554]  Yo, you about to hop up, he's laying down, he's going north, next building over!
[00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:50.334]  Right after the gap, he's got glasses, long hair.
[00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:53.935]  This building, he was on top of this building, the left one.
[00:04:54.415 --> 00:04:55.055]  I jumped up.
[00:04:55.155 --> 00:05:01.898]  This is a very serious, very serious.
[00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:03.258]  That one, laying down.
[00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:05.799]  There's a gap in between you and there.
[00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.120]  Yo Tess, you got me up once, get me up again.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.580]  Ready?
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.040]  Yep.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.241]  Alright, ready?
[00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.221]  Let's go.
[00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:13.881]  One, two, three.
[00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:17.423]  Yeah.
[00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:21.965]  All right here.
[00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:23.986]  They're staying there.
[00:05:24.606 --> 00:05:26.908]  You have a suspect.
[00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:47.144]  Yes, we do.
[00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:50.006]  Let's check on our guys, make sure we're all squared away.
[00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:51.427]  General's pumping.
[00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:52.568]  I heard some shots.
[00:05:52.648 --> 00:05:58.011]  I heard some snaps close by us when we were peeling out of there, so just make sure nobody's f***ing whacked.
[00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.372]  We are committed.
[00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:02.854]  We are armed with the body of the suspect.
[00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:04.355]  First, where we got shot at.
[00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:06.627]  There's a real close snap, dude.
[00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.968]  Bro, before you **** him up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude.
[00:06:10.448 --> 00:06:13.148]  He turned around, I **** dropped, and I saw his ****.
[00:06:13.188 --> 00:06:14.449]  That's why they got somebody up there.
[00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:15.709]  I thought somebody was up there.
[00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:16.229]  I put my head up here.
[00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:17.849]  If he was up there, I would have ****ed him up.
[00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:18.489]  I don't want to speculate.
[00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:18.829]  No, no, no, no.
[00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:19.429]  Is he a shooter?
[00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:20.130]  Did he have a weapon?
[00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.490]  Is he?
[00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.630]  That was a report.
[00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.270]  That was a report.
[00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.470]  He got up here.
[00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.271]  He wasn't moving.
[00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:26.391]  No!
[00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:27.531]  I'm a lawful man.
[00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:30.691]  I'm a lawful, less lethal.
[00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.532]  I've got my arms down.
[00:06:33.572 --> 00:06:34.672]  I'm gonna go move it.
[00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.858]  I told them they need to post the guys over here.
[00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:43.719]  I told them at the Secret Service.
[00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.099]  I told them that Tuesday.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.340]  I told them to post guys over here.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.600]  What?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.280]  No, we're inside.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.501]  Alpha one Bravo one.
[00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:03.363]  I told them to post f***ing guys over here.
[00:07:03.383 --> 00:07:06.848]  I wasn't even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof.
[00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:07.769]  They were inside.
[00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:08.330]  In the building.
[00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:19.303]  Okay, so there we have it.
[00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:23.845]  This is the video that is causing such waves across the media today.
[00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:25.706]  It's quite dramatic.
[00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:30.229]  We've confirmed with Butler Police Department that this comes from one of their body cameras.
[00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:37.293]  And I want to bring in now Jack Nevels, our guest, who is a specialist in this area, both for the military.
[00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:39.154]  Jack, you were an instructor.
[00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:42.496]  Greenberry instructor at their training school.
[00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:47.900]  You're in the military in special operations for many years and you do this on the law enforcement, civilian side now.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.625]  When you look at that video, can you give us a sense of what is your immediate reaction?
[00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:58.728]  Because I know that with your training you see things that the rest of us don't see.
[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:03.853]  Well, my immediate reaction is, you know, just taking a look at it.
[00:08:03.893 --> 00:08:15.018]  Number one, I'd like to say that, you know, the men and women that work in the security industry, whether it's in federal or state or local, are highly professional.
[00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:26.682]  And the Secret Service and the other federal snipers that I've worked with are incredibly, incredibly professional and very meticulous about what they do.
[00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:26.762]  And
[00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:37.092]  You know, when I 1st, look at this, I look at it, you know, from the planning perspective at the start of it, where the advanced teamwork.
[00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:41.415]  That would have come in instead of weeks ahead of time and figured all this out.
[00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:49.039]  I mean, it's common practice that when you have an area that you can't cover or a building that has a bunch of windows, you put up a large banner so that.
[00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:52.794]  It cuts down visibility to where your principal's at.
[00:08:53.414 --> 00:09:01.997]  And then when I look at the communications plan that fell through, you know, we have what we call in the military a PACE plan, Primary Alternate Contingency Emergency.
[00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:08.319]  These things are always buttoned down because everyone knows that when stuff goes down and communications are bad,
[00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:11.031]  That's when things start to fall apart.
[00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:23.487]  And so I see that there wasn't good communication between the different agencies and the planning that was supposed to take place the morning before the incident happened, where you kind of do your final.
[00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.930]  You know, get together and everybody make sure you're on the same sheet of music.
[00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:34.534]  Normally, we'd all stand together in a circle when we would make communications check with one another to make sure we can all talk to one another.
[00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:37.936]  We're all in the same sheet of music and then we go out and we conduct our business.
[00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:41.758]  So I think there was a series of failures that led up to.
[00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:43.299]  This point.
[00:09:57.876 --> 00:10:02.217]  What the Secret Service director has testified and what the Secret Service is saying, right?
[00:10:02.257 --> 00:10:06.438]  What he testified, the acting director testified in Congress.
[00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:10.580]  And they're showing, they really are standing up for themselves, right?
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.261]  I mean, Butler Police Department is saying, we're not going down with you, Secret Service, okay?
[00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:22.203]  Look, here's our guy, you can hear him on his body cam, and he's saying, I told the Secret Service.
[00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:25.704]  Now, my immediate reaction to that is, the Secret Service has one job.
[00:10:26.204 --> 00:10:27.506]  You laid out some of it, right?
[00:10:27.606 --> 00:10:28.887]  They go in weeks in advance.
[00:10:29.108 --> 00:10:30.950]  There's a team there the day before.
[00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:34.474]  This is their only job, is to secure that site.
[00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.256]  If you got windows, you put up a banner.
[00:10:36.276 --> 00:10:37.538]  There's no banner on those windows.
[00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:42.504]  You know, the minimum that is required is that you have communications that work.
[00:10:42.944 --> 00:10:44.625]  With everyone who's present on the ground.
[00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:48.427]  We all know if you don't have enough personnel, you're relying on local law enforcement.
[00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.208]  That's standard.
[00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.709]  But if you can't talk to them, that's useless.
[00:10:52.169 --> 00:11:01.615]  So what I see here is a lot of things that have been put in place to create the impression that these are failures.
[00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:07.258]  Right, that these things somehow just went wrong, that this is DEI higher and this is that.
[00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:14.323]  But there's no way, tell me there's no way on God's earth that these things all just happened by accident.
[00:11:14.463 --> 00:11:15.104]  I don't believe it.
[00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:30.054]  Yeah, it's hard to get your head around because these failures are so epic and they're so elementary, like the things that fell through were something a third grader could figure out.
[00:11:30.214 --> 00:11:30.995]  And again, having
[00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:41.791]  Having worked with, you know, Tier 1 level snipers around the globe, you know, training foreigners and training different folks here in the States.
[00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:53.297]  All of these men and women are super, super professional and having something fall through like this, it's kind of hard to get your head around.
[00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:54.957]  I would agree with you on that.
[00:11:55.017 --> 00:11:55.558]  Just from a
[00:11:56.778 --> 00:11:57.679]  It's intentional.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:08.329]  Is there any way that you... Okay, we don't have evidence to prove that it's intentional, but when you look at that, do you really, in your heart of hearts, with all your experience, believe that happened by accident?
[00:12:11.092 --> 00:12:15.135]  It's hard for me to say that there wasn't some intentionality somewhere.
[00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:21.902]  Now, where that intentionality lies, I have no idea, because I just can't... Again, I can't get my head around the fact that
[00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:27.107]  The this organization that is as good as everybody.
[00:12:27.127 --> 00:12:28.948]  They're actually as good as everybody thinks they are.
[00:12:29.128 --> 00:12:30.970]  I mean, they they do that level of work.
[00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:35.333]  And so the idea that they wouldn't do something- Across the globe.
[00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:41.498]  Okay, you got a local police officer saying, I told them to put someone on top of that building.
[00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:43.400]  I beep beep told them.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.000]  Right?
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.442]  I mean, there's no mistaking what he's saying there.
[00:12:46.743 --> 00:12:47.904]  It's very, very clear.
[00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:49.805]  So why the Secret Service?
[00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:53.008]  First of all, they don't need a local police officer to tell them that.
[00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:53.749]  Okay?
[00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:58.072]  Anyone with half a brain can look at that site and know you got to secure the rooftops.
[00:12:58.353 --> 00:12:58.673]  That's it.
[00:12:59.952 --> 00:13:04.416]  Right, and it shouldn't be the local PD telling the Secret Service what to do in that situation.
[00:13:04.796 --> 00:13:16.547]  It should have been Secret Service saying, this is the plan, this is how we're executing this, they have command and control of this, and the people that augment them are just augmentees, they're not in charge of the operation.
[00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:25.535]  So, you know, from the Secret Service level, where that breakdown of chain of command and command and control happened,
[00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:35.809]  You know, I don't know, having not been to the actual site, not being privy to all the information in the investigation, but it definitely looks suspect.
[00:13:35.909 --> 00:13:40.472]  It definitely looks, um, like an epic failure.
[00:13:40.572 --> 00:13:44.854]  That is, it's too epic to, um, to happen accidentally.
[00:13:44.974 --> 00:13:52.297]  Like, there's all these coincidences that all lined up that allowed this one shooter to be in that one place at that specific time.
[00:13:52.997 --> 00:13:53.638]  Seems, um,
[00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:57.986]  Okay, I'm going to throw you a final question, Jack.
[00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.908]  I'm going to throw you a curveball here, okay?
[00:14:00.288 --> 00:14:14.378]  I've been talking to a number of very senior sources, people with a lot of experience in special operations, a couple of snipers, counter snipers, and none of them believe that that kid fired the shot that hit Donald Trump's ear.
[00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:15.439]  None of them.
[00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:19.965]  I mean, they don't have any evidence, but based on their experience, they say, I don't buy it.
[00:14:20.285 --> 00:14:21.227]  There was another shooter.
[00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:25.953]  One, possibly two, but you know, there's no evidence of that yet because they're not on site.
[00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:27.035]  They're not investigating.
[00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:28.997]  What would you say to that?
[00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:30.920]  Where do your instincts lie?
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.940]  I would say it's probable.
[00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:45.763]  I mean, again, without having a comprehensive investigation, I would think that with an event of this magnitude that we would be having daily briefs from somebody.
[00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:46.543]  And we're not.
[00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:47.663]  No briefs from anybody.
[00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:52.704]  Let the American public know to squash any conspiracy theories that may be out there.
[00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:54.105]  Or concerns, right?
[00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:54.885]  Just questions.
[00:14:56.428 --> 00:15:05.173]  Right now, having said that, you know, taking a 140-yard shot with an AR-15 is a pretty easy shot.
[00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:07.834]  We do what we call a point-blank zero.
[00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:21.782]  If I zero that weapon at 50 yards or 50 meters, given its trajectory, it's going to come back down and cross over your sight line probably at around 185, 200 yards, meaning that if you just hold the sights,
[00:15:22.162 --> 00:15:29.704]  Right at one point, all the way from point blank out to about 200, you're going to get a hit within plus or minus two inches vertically.
[00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:41.887]  Obviously, President Trump turning his head or the winds or whatnot, five, five, six rounds are very prone to deflection and wind just because of the lightweight projectile that they're firing.
[00:15:42.527 --> 00:15:46.908]  But is it probable that that shot could have been made by him?
[00:15:47.228 --> 00:15:47.528]  Yes.
[00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:51.289]  Is it also probable that there could have been another shooter?
[00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:59.830]  Possibly, without physically going on the ground and looking at where these other shots could come from, from a similar trajectory, a similar angle.
[00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:01.971]  I can't speak authoritatively about that.
[00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:08.253]  But if you were a betting man, Jack, and you had to put money on it, is your money on the dead kid or somebody else?
[00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:10.994]  Oh man, that's a good one.
[00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:14.395]  I'm going to get you one way or another.
[00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:16.215]  You're going to get me one way or the other.
[00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:20.237]  If I was a betting man, I would say it could go either way.
[00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:20.877]  How about that?
[00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:23.922]  You're definitely a Green Beret.
[00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.323]  Yeah.
[00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:26.524]  Playing it both ways.
[00:16:26.564 --> 00:16:27.705]  That's in the DNA.
[00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:30.847]  Well, there's both of that.
[00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:32.729]  You know all about that.
[00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:34.370]  The diplomat, Jack.
[00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:40.335]  I'm going to get you in the bar and get a couple of drinks into you, and then I'm going to get the real story.
[00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:41.756]  Okay.
[00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:42.977]  Well, we'll see about that.
[00:16:44.097 --> 00:16:46.059]  Thank you so much for joining us, okay?
[00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:46.940]  Good to see you.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.841]  Thank you, and thanks for what you do.
[00:16:49.201 --> 00:16:49.902]  Get the truth out there.
[00:16:50.345 --> 00:16:51.305]  Okay, thank you so much.
[00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:59.589]  Okay, for our next guest coming up, this assassination attempt on President Trump, obviously not happening in a vacuum.
[00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:07.013]  Everybody in the United States focused on what's coming up in the next few months, which is, of course, the presidential election.
[00:17:07.573 --> 00:17:18.198]  And what is consistently the number one issue concerning people across this country today, this concerns people on both sides of the political aisle, but it's the border.
[00:17:19.719 --> 00:17:28.121]  And it's a conversation that gets so bogged down in politics, and anybody who knows me knows I really can't stand politics.
[00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:30.081]  We get dragged into politics all the time.
[00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:32.882]  There's no escape, okay?
[00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:44.004]  But I am never going to abandon my mission to follow the facts, wherever they take you, and to bring insight and knowledge into these issues that help all of us transcend the politics.
[00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:46.465]  And so my next guest is going to help us do that.
[00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:48.686]  Somebody that I've known for a long time.
[00:17:48.726 --> 00:17:55.028]  He has 22 years of experience in the United States military where he was an intelligence analyst for much of that time.
[00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:58.030]  Worked for many years on the southern border and border patrol.
[00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:08.734]  His military career was brought to a premature end because he refused to take experimental medical vaccine against his will and they took everything from him.
[00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:15.058]  He is someone who I know to be a man of principle and who is very, very committed.
[00:18:15.378 --> 00:18:19.721]  He has worked the front lines of this issue year after year after year.
[00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:23.824]  He's also one of the smartest guys I have ever met in my entire life.
[00:18:23.864 --> 00:18:24.885]  His name is Eamon Blair.
[00:18:25.165 --> 00:18:28.788]  He is now a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
[00:18:30.749 --> 00:18:31.649]  It's nice to see you.
[00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:39.052]  I sat through your presentation last night in my hometown in Texas and people were fascinated.
[00:18:39.112 --> 00:18:44.714]  One of the things that really struck me listening to you because you and I have, you know, we've been in touch for years now and
[00:18:46.274 --> 00:18:52.360]  And I know a lot of what you know, but I still learn things from you, which is something I always appreciate.
[00:18:52.741 --> 00:19:06.114]  So you started out by really demonstrating that what we are looking at is a policy that you called weaponized migration, where human beings have been turned into a weapon of war.
[00:19:06.474 --> 00:19:09.117]  Can you explain what you mean by that?
[00:19:10.848 --> 00:19:11.448]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:19.471]  So a lot of nations, they utilize human beings as a weapon of war.
[00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:36.316]  And what I mean by that is, ever since the Refugee Convention in the 1950s, when the term refugee and asylum seeker was really codified in international law, nation states figured out that they could destroy the sovereignty of other nations
[00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.277]  By manufacturing a humanitarian crisis.
[00:19:41.217 --> 00:20:01.022]  So if we look at what's happening at our southern border, but if we look at what's happening in Europe right now, to give you a really good example, Lukashenko, the dictator of Europe, he is the current leader of Belarus, decided that he was going to utilize the same tactic against the nation states surrounding him.
[00:20:01.342 --> 00:20:04.062]  So Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
[00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:05.503]  So what he did is he
[00:20:06.463 --> 00:20:08.684]  Decreased his immigration standards.
[00:20:08.844 --> 00:20:17.147]  And while I'm saying this, I think, wow, is what is happening in the United States similar to what is happening over there?
[00:20:17.407 --> 00:20:24.530]  And so what he did, Lukashenko, he decreased his immigration status or immigration standards.
[00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:30.488]  He allowed thousands of people from the Middle East and Africa into his country.
[00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:37.790]  Then he transported them to the borders of Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.
[00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:47.013]  And there he knew what would happen is if Poland or the other countries pushed back and wouldn't allow them in, it would
[00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.462]  Engineer or manufacture a humanitarian crisis.
[00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:58.004]  Okay, so I think, I think, Eamon, you have a photograph, right, that you showed during your presentation.
[00:20:58.284 --> 00:20:59.544]  And I know we have a copy of that.
[00:20:59.604 --> 00:21:00.625]  Maybe we can pull that up.
[00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:04.406]  Because this, does this feed directly into what you're saying?
[00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:05.986]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:21:06.907 --> 00:21:07.207]  Okay.
[00:21:08.187 --> 00:21:09.647]  So we'll, we'll pull that up.
[00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:11.628]  And if you could carry on with what you're saying.
[00:21:13.536 --> 00:21:26.206]  Sure, so Lukashenko realized that if he was able to create a humanitarian crisis large enough on these borders, it would force all of their security forces to handle that situation.
[00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:41.898]  So this would force a country like Poland to decide whether they would either push them back into Belarus or accept them into their own country as refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:51.592]  And it also forced their agencies, their security agencies, whether they're military or border guard, to then put all of their resources
[00:21:52.914 --> 00:22:01.282]  This is really interesting because it's exactly what we've seen play out at the southern border, right?
[00:22:01.302 --> 00:22:04.104]  I mean, you broke this down into two aspects in your talk.
[00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:06.786]  One is that you're presented with this hypocrisy cost.
[00:22:20.598 --> 00:22:33.265]  Is what you call it, where we are forced to choose between border security and what we feel is our God-given human decency, right?
[00:22:33.345 --> 00:22:43.130]  When you look at this humanitarian catastrophe happening, and your response, your emotional response and everything else is, okay, we've got to help these people, we've got to focus on that.
[00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:49.857]  And then you showed how that's exactly what our agencies have done.
[00:22:50.237 --> 00:22:59.907]  We've gone from securing the border with the Department of Defense to now Customs and Border Protection, which now defines itself as a humanitarian agency on their own website.
[00:23:00.427 --> 00:23:04.592]  So, can you expand on that and just put that in the American context?
[00:23:06.141 --> 00:23:16.905]  Yeah, so when this happens, you're going to see images of children being pushed back by the Border Patrol here on the United States side.
[00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:23.708]  You're going to see the depravity of human beings forced into the cartels, the hands of the cartels.
[00:23:24.308 --> 00:23:35.072]  And so as a Border Patrol agent, as an agency, you're now, or as the state of Texas, since we're in Texas, you are now given the option of either pushing them back into Mexico,
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:43.263]  into the hands of the Mexican cartels or to bring them into the United States.
[00:23:43.784 --> 00:23:45.124]  And it's all by design.
[00:23:45.184 --> 00:23:48.466]  So the interesting thing that's actually happening in the U.S.
[00:23:48.506 --> 00:24:02.913]  side is whereas other nations are doing it against other nations as a form of hybrid warfare, our nation, this is the first time in recorded history, our nation is doing it to ourselves.
[00:24:04.594 --> 00:24:07.114]  And so you got to sit there and think, why?
[00:24:07.234 --> 00:24:33.659]  Why is it that our current administration is using a hybrid warfare tactic of using human beings as a weapon to administer or to manufacture humanitarian crisis on our southern border, to force our agents and our agencies to then become, go from security to humanitarian relief, leaving the rest of our border
[00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:36.361]  Up to the cartels.
[00:24:38.282 --> 00:24:43.964]  We have on the screen here a little girl, and I think this captures exactly what you're talking about.
[00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:50.606]  And if I remember correctly, this is a little girl that you found when you were a border patrol agent.
[00:24:50.846 --> 00:24:52.726]  And this is the reason you quit, actually.
[00:24:53.247 --> 00:24:55.067]  Can you tell us about that?
[00:24:57.148 --> 00:24:57.608]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:24:57.888 --> 00:25:00.429]  So this was in the city of Roma.
[00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:09.931]  And a tactic that the smugglers use is they'll drop off UACs or juveniles so that the rest of the group can get away.
[00:25:10.892 --> 00:25:14.535]  So there was only two of us agents in Roma at that time.
[00:25:15.496 --> 00:25:17.357]  And so the other one was a transport.
[00:25:17.517 --> 00:25:21.320]  And so when they dropped off a 17-year-old, the transport agent took that.
[00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:23.242]  And then I followed foot sign.
[00:25:24.242 --> 00:25:28.546]  Uh, tracking the rest of the group and they, um, I tracked them.
[00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:29.927]  They were going up the cliffs.
[00:25:30.027 --> 00:25:34.791]  If you've ever been to Roma, I know you've been there many times, uh, on the Roma bluffs.
[00:25:35.192 --> 00:25:41.697]  Uh, they were scaling the Roma bluffs and this little girl was on the back of, uh, uh, one of the large gentlemen in the group.
[00:25:42.358 --> 00:25:48.063]  So as I was running up to the bluffs, um, I met, I approached them really close on the blacktop.
[00:25:48.643 --> 00:25:51.526]  And that's when he decided to throw the little girl into the street.
[00:25:53.112 --> 00:25:54.493]  Um, to try to get away from me.
[00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:58.815]  Um, so of course the little girl was screaming and hysterical.
[00:25:59.796 --> 00:26:01.256]  And, uh, and so I picked her up.
[00:26:01.356 --> 00:26:08.760]  She immediately stopped crying or took her back to my, my kilo unit, my truck and, uh, gave her some snacks and water and whatnot.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.783]  And, and then Roma police department, which assists the border patrol in that area.
[00:26:13.803 --> 00:26:17.285]  Uh, so much so we, we couldn't do our job without Roma PD.
[00:26:18.145 --> 00:26:21.327]  And, uh, they, they caught a few of the members of that group.
[00:26:22.234 --> 00:26:28.039]  And then so the other agent called me over and I went over there and they claimed that that girl was theirs.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.121]  So I asked to see their documents.
[00:26:31.682 --> 00:26:36.906]  I was part of the Collateral Intelligence Unit during 2019, during that surge in 2019.
[00:26:36.986 --> 00:26:38.227]  And so we were breaking fake families.
[00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:42.831]  And so I understand what to look for in terms of false documents.
[00:26:44.447 --> 00:26:54.335]  Okay we have a sorry to interrupt you there we have a break coming up and we'll be back to finish the rest of that story with you on the show right after this.

[00:27:50.913 --> 00:27:53.537]  The Linus Pauling formula at infowarstore.com.
[00:27:54.853 --> 00:27:58.858]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:01.641]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[00:28:01.661 --> 00:28:05.886]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.309]  Because without you, we would not be on the air.
[00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.495]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[00:28:14.176 --> 00:28:25.718]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[00:28:26.339 --> 00:28:35.120]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.281]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products
[00:28:38.922 --> 00:28:44.690]  Are actually our famous products simply private labeled and others are different formulas this company offers.
[00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.031]  They're all top of the line.
[00:28:46.072 --> 00:28:47.093]  They're already best sellers.
[00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:52.861]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names, but they are all the very best.
[00:28:53.342 --> 00:28:55.445]  So this line is called Info Wars MD.
[00:28:56.454 --> 00:28:58.156]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:02.180]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.143]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[00:29:05.663 --> 00:29:08.546]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:10.788]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[00:29:10.808 --> 00:29:12.550]  It's so good for your heart cardiovascular system.
[00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:13.771]  It is the exact
[00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:15.052]  Same formula.
[00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:16.834]  So our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[00:29:17.114 --> 00:29:18.316]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[00:29:18.616 --> 00:29:22.019]  They even let us use their name Nitric Boost a few years ago.
[00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:27.065]  So they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:29.847]  So these are all really amazing products.
[00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:35.934]  You want to check out the line of InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[00:29:36.554 --> 00:29:38.495]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:39.816]  I need you to take action.
[00:29:40.117 --> 00:29:41.237]  You will love these products.
[00:29:41.477 --> 00:29:42.818]  They work really, really good.
[00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:53.065]  No matter which one you try, they're already top of the line, tested, private label by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[00:29:53.265 --> 00:29:54.046]  Thank you for your support.
[00:30:02.515 --> 00:30:12.502]  Okay, I am Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones today, and I am talking to Eamon Blair, who is both a Border Patrol agent and intelligence analyst for the U.S.
[00:30:12.562 --> 00:30:14.263]  military for 22 years.
[00:30:14.283 --> 00:30:26.432]  Eamon, you were talking about this little girl right here, who you found, right, when you were a Border Patrol agent, and telling us why this is what made you quit.
[00:30:28.956 --> 00:30:29.356]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:30:29.396 --> 00:30:33.177]  And so, Alex, just to get back to that story a little bit and then wrap that up.
[00:30:34.037 --> 00:30:37.838]  So at the end of the day, the family said that that girl was theirs.
[00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:39.279]  They showed false documents.
[00:30:39.459 --> 00:30:44.900]  I couldn't break them, meaning that I couldn't get them to state that they were false documents.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.340]  And so I had to let her go.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:53.042]  So you were handing her over to people who you knew in your heart were not her real family?
[00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:54.542]  Correct.
[00:30:54.902 --> 00:30:56.223]  And why did that bother you so much?
[00:30:56.263 --> 00:30:57.123]  You gave up everything.
[00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:00.423]  Because that was her last hope.
[00:31:01.544 --> 00:31:05.287]  That was her last hope before being killed by rape.
[00:31:07.469 --> 00:31:12.934]  Whether she's going to go into a life of sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or if she's going to be recycled.
[00:31:13.474 --> 00:31:14.335]  How do you know that?
[00:31:16.997 --> 00:31:24.564]  Well, through our many investigations ever since, really since 2019, when we were dealing with fake family units back then under the Trump administration.
[00:31:25.757 --> 00:31:40.091]  That's when we started doing the rapid DNA testing and other measures to try to break this cycle of recycling of children of the Mexican cartels, kidnapping kids on the South Side, creating fake families so that they could come up North.
[00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:41.512]  What people don't need to realize is
[00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.332]  It wasn't really us that were separating kids or separating families.
[00:31:46.392 --> 00:31:47.392]  It was the Mexican cartels.
[00:31:48.332 --> 00:32:04.459]  And so what they do is they need to get their product, quote unquote, human cargo or humans, from point A to point B. And in order to do so, they realized, based off our policies, that we would release into the country people who were a certain type of nationality.
[00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:06.040]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:32.385]  Whether it's fake families, whether it's fake juvies or UACs, fake passports, you name it.
[00:32:32.906 --> 00:32:39.512]  Because they needed to get that product from point A to point B. But when the Biden administration came in, most of that stopped.
[00:32:39.632 --> 00:32:44.476]  You stopped vetting families, you stopped DNA testing, you stopped doing most of what you're talking about.
[00:32:44.637 --> 00:32:46.819]  Your job basically changed.
[00:32:48.345 --> 00:32:48.625]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:32:48.685 --> 00:32:59.257]  Our job changed from one of trying to push everything back and to adhere to our immigration law to one of bringing everyone in.
[00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:01.259]  Because it became a humanitarian mission.
[00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:02.801]  Yes ma'am.
[00:33:03.061 --> 00:33:04.262]  We became a humanitarian mission.
[00:33:18.846 --> 00:33:22.068]  So you're no longer a border security agency.
[00:33:22.088 --> 00:33:24.990]  I mean, this is a job used to be done by the Department of Defense.
[00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.191]  Now we have a humanitarian agency.
[00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:30.213]  Wait, the number one priority here is rescues.
[00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:32.254]  Number two is family care.
[00:33:32.794 --> 00:33:43.901]  And then American safety, which I'm sure every American citizen will be thrilled to know that their safety comes third after rescues and family care for people coming from all over the world.
[00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:55.444]  But your point about this, Eamon, is not that, I mean, you cared so much about what was happening, what you saw with your own eyes, that you gave up your whole career because you couldn't deal with it anymore.
[00:33:55.924 --> 00:34:07.227]  And what you're trying to get people to understand is that this entire humanitarian crisis is manufactured as a weapon of war against, by our own government, against our own people.
[00:34:07.787 --> 00:34:08.127]  Correct?
[00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:09.810]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.250]  Yep.
[00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:16.697]  And so it's not just a weapon of war physically, so using human beings, but also in informational warfare.
[00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:28.010]  They can utilize this and state that based off of our current metrics in the Department of Homeland Security to determine whether the border is secure or not, it's all immigration related.
[00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:29.230]  Which is not true.
[00:34:51.874 --> 00:34:52.935]  Correct, which is not true.
[00:34:52.975 --> 00:35:02.006]  But that's why, like, in 2019, when we tried getting funds appropriated so we could do expedited removals, Nancy Pelosi would state, hey, what are you talking about?
[00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:03.448]  We don't need border security.
[00:35:03.488 --> 00:35:11.037]  The only thing that's happening is family units, refugees, asylum seekers coming to the border because that's all you see on TV.
[00:35:12.018 --> 00:35:18.740]  So not only is it a manufactured humanitarian crisis, both in the physical world, but also on the information side.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.601]  We're being duped.
[00:35:20.801 --> 00:35:32.704]  It's all propaganda to let the American people know or feel guilt that what is happening on the border is just humanitarian, when in all reality our own government created it.
[00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:43.010]  Okay, so Eamon, one of the things I know that you and I have talked a lot about is the fact that none of these policies, whether they're Republican or Democrat policies, they all address immigration.
[00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.511]  They define the border in terms of immigration.
[00:35:45.851 --> 00:35:47.172]  It's an immigration problem.
[00:35:47.192 --> 00:35:48.233]  They ignore the cartels.
[00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:57.258]  These are the cartels that, let's see, I mean, way back in 2010, they took 72 migrants out of a house in Mexico and massacred them, and that was in San Fernando.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.642]  Then the Allende Massacre was when they went into one of these towns near the border.
[00:36:05.682 --> 00:36:08.924]  They killed all the ranchers first, and then they went and killed everybody else.
[00:36:09.764 --> 00:36:11.485]  They just obliterated the entire town.
[00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:20.429]  And just recently, Mexico had its bloodiest election in history with some 32 people murdered who were running in that election.
[00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:27.855]  What all of this does, this focus on immigration ignores what is happening with the cartels.
[00:36:27.895 --> 00:36:30.277]  We still don't have any policies to deal with the cartels.
[00:36:30.877 --> 00:36:41.526]  And what I want to bring you to discuss that is, I mean, possibly one of the most underreported and most significant aspects of this is the information war that you mentioned.
[00:36:41.906 --> 00:36:46.010]  And who, who is running that information war and who is paying for it?
[00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.152]  Because this is the kind of thing we're talking about, right?
[00:36:49.212 --> 00:36:51.054]  Explain, explain this to me.
[00:36:52.737 --> 00:37:01.288]  Sure, as I said, their whole goal is to get everyone to believe that the only thing happening at our border is a humanitarian crisis through information warfare.
[00:37:04.163 --> 00:37:09.605]  The largest dark money network in the United States is called Arabella Advisors.
[00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:18.728]  And Arabella Advisors, through their 1630 fund, created a 501c4 called Galvanize Action.
[00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:25.830]  Galvanize Action, then what they did is they got neuroscientists, behavioral scientists,
[00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.091]  And they went across all of our tech platforms.
[00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:33.472]  So every think of every social media platform that all of us are on.
[00:37:34.672 --> 00:37:41.174]  And they went out there and they wanted to see what the values were of each person based off of your behavior.
[00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:44.614]  Like you you're buying what you buy what you put on social media.
[00:37:44.914 --> 00:37:45.355]  You name it.
[00:37:45.655 --> 00:37:47.015]  They wanted to figure out your values.
[00:37:47.875 --> 00:37:50.698]  Then they used neuroscience to figure out, you know what we're going to do?
[00:37:51.279 --> 00:38:00.828]  We need to shift these people's mindset, the people that are not politically active specifically, the people that are done with politics because they're tired of both left and right.
[00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:04.912]  They wanted to get into their eyeballs and they wanted to get in front of them.
[00:38:05.953 --> 00:38:09.276]  And so what they did is they used neuroscience to figure out, hey,
[00:38:10.971 --> 00:38:12.533]  What would it take?
[00:38:12.593 --> 00:38:18.738]  What messaging would it take to move them from pro-border security to pro-open borders?
[00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:28.087]  And they use behavior science and neuroscience from everyone's social media platforms and profiles to then create ads
[00:38:29.148 --> 00:38:30.749]  Across all of social media.
[00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:33.330]  And we've got two of these ads here, right?
[00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.950]  You want to speak specifically to this?
[00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:36.711]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:41.133]  This first one we have is immigrants fight for our country.
[00:38:41.613 --> 00:38:42.533]  They have our back.
[00:38:42.813 --> 00:38:44.914]  We need to have theirs, right?
[00:38:45.354 --> 00:38:46.455]  And then we have this one.
[00:38:47.155 --> 00:38:50.636]  When my husband got sick, my neighbors brought over soup and watched the kids.
[00:38:51.136 --> 00:38:53.097]  Community means taking care of each other.
[00:38:53.477 --> 00:38:57.379]  My neighbor may be new to America, but she is now family to us.
[00:38:59.141 --> 00:38:59.842]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:39:00.382 --> 00:39:20.376]  And they're amazing in the fact that they have all quantifiable data to show how much these actually move, like what percentage points each and every one of these messages moves the target audience towards their desired belief system or agenda.
[00:39:20.957 --> 00:39:23.639]  And so the one I think on the military one, I think,
[00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:24.719]  We're good to go.
[00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.592]  Thank you so much.
[00:39:55.282 --> 00:39:59.364]  Arabelle Advisors, Galvanized Action, the far left, figured out a way to reach them.
[00:39:59.624 --> 00:40:02.346]  And that is because every one of us is on social media.
[00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:14.032]  And they're just using ads, just like a company would, to target them, to use these simple little phrases that doesn't seem political at all, but can then shift your mind.
[00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:17.334]  And then once they've shifted your mind, they're going to shift your actions.
[00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:42.762]  So, Eamon, while we're all focused on this humanitarian crisis that has been engineered by our own leaders, right, and we're being subjected to this disinformation campaign, what is the reality that we're missing in terms of, I know you had a piece out that said there were two days in May with more Chinese people came across the southern border than in the whole of 2021 in the entire year.
[00:40:43.802 --> 00:40:46.624]  We've talked extensively about the Venezuelan cartels.
[00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:55.791]  Particularly Trendaragua, which is a cartel that was created by Chavez in Venezuela inside the prison system.
[00:40:56.112 --> 00:40:59.855]  So they've emptied those prisons now, which means not just random criminals.
[00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:08.341]  This is an organized criminal cartel that has come into the United States that is working with the Mexican cartels and backed by the Chinese.
[00:41:08.401 --> 00:41:13.986]  Can you just, can you tell us about the reality of that and the significance of it?
[00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:22.737]  Yes, you mentioned before that we've never really had policies or operations against the Mexican cartels.
[00:41:22.757 --> 00:41:29.104]  The Mexican cartels went from just criminal organizations to now a parallel government.
[00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:32.728]  They are foreign terrorist organizations and should be designated as such.
[00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.350]  But because we've done nothing
[00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.050]  We're good to go.
[00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:00.416]  I don't know.
[00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:18.134]  Not just at our border, but to every single one of our communities.
[00:42:19.115 --> 00:42:38.452]  And because the Mexican cartels have done so, every single one of our adversaries, both state and non-state, realize that in order to get access to our communities, to disrupt our communities, to destabilize it, to destroy it, and reap massive financial gain at the same time,
[00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:44.641]  I like what the CCP is doing by weaponizing the Mexican cartels through their drug warfare against us.
[00:42:45.482 --> 00:42:54.167]  They realized in order to do that, they must work with the Mexican cartels who have already built that infrastructure into every single one of our communities.
[00:42:55.147 --> 00:43:05.654]  So now when Biden administration, to give an example, you mentioned Tren de Aragua, the Biden administration, when they stopped all
[00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:15.898]  Security efforts whatsoever, and they invited the millions of foreign nationals into our country.
[00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:22.107]  What they did is they also invited Tren de Aragua.
[00:43:22.207 --> 00:43:28.610]  What I mean by that is, look, Hugo Chavez, dictator, Maduro, dictator, destroying Venezuela.
[00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.331]  Millions of people have fled.
[00:43:30.851 --> 00:43:34.512]  But it really wasn't until the Biden administration that they fled to the U.S.
[00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:40.915]  If you look at the data, our encounters with Venezuelans roughly in 2017 was roughly about 2,600.
[00:43:44.761 --> 00:43:50.864]  Now fast forward to 2023, our encounters with Venezuelans was 334,000.
[00:43:51.104 --> 00:43:56.447]  And that is all due to Biden's open borders policies.
[00:43:57.407 --> 00:44:07.973]  And so because of this influx in such a short amount of time, Brandi Aragua, how they built their entire enterprise was actually off the backs of over 8 million Venezuelans leaving.
[00:44:08.553 --> 00:44:15.425]  So, but Eamon, what's interesting here is that Tren de Aragua, as a Venezuelan cartel, is not in conflict with the Mexican cartels.
[00:44:15.465 --> 00:44:16.547]  I mean, how did that happen?
[00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.975]  No, they realized, Tren de Aragua realized that
[00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:24.775]  In order to be successful, they must make alliances.
[00:44:25.635 --> 00:44:31.057]  And as you said before, is backed by the Maduro regime.
[00:44:31.497 --> 00:44:35.958]  That Maduro regime, Venezuela, has its own threat network.
[00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:38.299]  That threat network includes Iran.
[00:44:39.199 --> 00:44:40.680]  Russia and China.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:54.690]  Okay, and so when the Mexican cartels are also working with the CCP in terms of fentanyl precursors, in terms of money laundering operations, in terms of a bulk cash money, you name it.
[00:44:57.692 --> 00:45:13.212]  It just goes hand in hand through this threat network that Tren de Aragua has built a really good relationship actually with CJNG, Cartel Jalisco New Generation, which is the most hyper-violent Mexican cartel that exists in Mexico and throughout the world.
[00:45:14.273 --> 00:45:18.755]  And through this threat network, Brindis Aragua, now you're seeing it in the United States.
[00:45:19.195 --> 00:45:26.378]  You're seeing them, whether that's in Colorado, with what we just saw in Aurora with those 5,000 Venezuelans.
[00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:29.439]  You're seeing it when they just did that jewelry heist.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.981]  You're seeing it in New York and Chicago.
[00:45:32.281 --> 00:45:33.441]  You're seeing it all over the U.S.
[00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:35.202]  and you're like, wow, what happened?
[00:45:35.242 --> 00:45:36.442]  Why was it all of a sudden?
[00:45:36.502 --> 00:45:42.165]  It was all of a sudden because our administration invited them through weaponized mass migration.
[00:45:42.765 --> 00:45:58.773]  And Eamon, I don't think people really realize, you know, for years, when people have said we're worried about the cartels, we're worried about border security, everybody looks to the crime statistics and they say, but you don't have a lot of murder in your little border town in Arizona or, you know, Texas or wherever.
[00:45:59.073 --> 00:46:00.634]  You don't have any issue there.
[00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:02.655]  This is all right-wing propaganda, right?
[00:46:03.915 --> 00:46:15.498]  But one of the things that you and I are now, our good friend Jason Jones, who is an incredible voice on the border, who's on Newsmax, former Texas counterterrorism specialist.
[00:46:16.558 --> 00:46:29.062]  One of the things that he goes on about, on and on and on about, is that we don't actually, our police and law enforcement are not set up to monitor the crimes that relate to the cartels.
[00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:38.070]  In fact, they're using an old statistic measure that really bears no relationship to the reality of where we are today.
[00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.592]  Can you expand on that for us, please?
[00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.050]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:49.014]  So, how we measure the criminal activity in our area is based off of something that was created in 1929, the Uniform Crime Report.
[00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:52.436]  Now, it has been updated to national incident-based reporting system.
[00:46:53.056 --> 00:47:00.700]  However, it doesn't cover all the crimes related to the Mexican cartels, transnational criminal organizations, the CCP, none of that inside the U.S.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.000]  Such as what?
[00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:04.722]  Human trafficking, sex trafficking?
[00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:08.521]  Human trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking.
[00:47:08.541 --> 00:47:11.664]  How about cyber attacks?
[00:47:12.646 --> 00:47:20.033]  Every single criminal enterprise that the cartels, the CCP, anyone is utilizing inside the United States, we're not tracking it.
[00:47:20.574 --> 00:47:25.900]  And so when we state that something is happening on the southern border, even smuggling is not being tracked.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:36.562]  And so therefore, people on the left will be like, hey, look, nothing is happening on the southern border, even though that smuggling is happening every second of every hour.
[00:47:37.082 --> 00:47:44.823]  However, it's not being placed into the Department of Justice, I mean, DOJ's system of the Uniform Crime Report or National Incident Based Reporting System.
[00:47:45.243 --> 00:47:49.004]  So it really shows that, wow, nothing really exists.
[00:47:49.384 --> 00:47:55.645]  In fact, in academia right now, they're trying to make the same claim that they did with Antifa, that the Mexican cartels
[00:47:56.485 --> 00:47:58.609]  Are really just nothing.
[00:47:58.649 --> 00:48:00.472]  They're not an organization itself.
[00:48:00.793 --> 00:48:02.757]  They're just decentralized.
[00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:05.870]  We're good to go.
[00:48:26.602 --> 00:48:33.445]  And so unfortunately, we're having to use like anecdotal evidence, videos, you name it.
[00:48:33.465 --> 00:48:35.406]  And that's where you guys come in and fit in.
[00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:44.009]  News media, because you guys are really showing what's actually happening because our government refuses to show what is actually happening.
[00:48:44.284 --> 00:48:49.887]  In fact, they go out of their way to try to prevent the media from seeing, and the American people from seeing what's really happening.
[00:48:49.907 --> 00:48:58.150]  And Eamon, that kind of brings us, when you talk about academia, I don't think people really understand the role that academia plays in this.
[00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:10.496]  When I was investigating the border for my show, I was shocked to find this real push from academia against the parents of fentanyl victims.
[00:49:10.916 --> 00:49:19.000]  Who are pushing for justice, who want people dealing in fentanyl to be held accountable because, you know, they feel that that's a first step to stopping what's happening.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:27.784]  And yet they're being opposed by academics who, by the way, are funded by, let me see, is it people like the Open Society Foundations?
[00:49:28.364 --> 00:49:31.446]  Is it people like, oh wait, Arabella Investors?
[00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:34.947]  I mean, you know, and you touched on the dark money part of it.
[00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:39.069]  But OK, here's a tough question, and we only have two minutes before we have to go to the break.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.141]  OK, who's funding Arabella investors?
[00:49:43.341 --> 00:49:44.662]  Where does the dark money come from?
[00:49:44.682 --> 00:49:58.290]  Man, all of all the people that we always talk about, whether that's George Soros, you name all the ones that we're not technically, quote unquote, allowed to talk about, that's who's really funding it.
[00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:03.473]  If you look at the Democrat money in the United States, you and I were discussing this last night.
[00:50:04.353 --> 00:50:07.615]  Unfortunately, they're willing to fund their war front.
[00:50:09.711 --> 00:50:19.795]  And whether that's through ActBlue, whether that's through other organizations, the Democrat side and the far left are willing to put money where their mouth is.
[00:50:20.515 --> 00:50:22.836]  And they have a network of affinity groups, right?
[00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:28.738]  I mean, they have the Kellogg Foundation, the Tides Foundation, the Knight Foundation, the Ford Foundation.
[00:50:28.758 --> 00:50:30.638]  I mean, notice the consistency there.
[00:50:30.658 --> 00:50:32.479]  There's always the foundation, right?
[00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:35.280]  Because this is a fabulous way to launder money.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.822]  You don't have to pay taxes.
[00:50:37.342 --> 00:50:43.350]  It doesn't matter if you violate your 5013C status of being non-partisan, because you're not going to be held accountable.
[00:50:43.471 --> 00:50:46.094]  That's the reality if you're one of these groups.
[00:50:46.895 --> 00:50:49.279]  No one's ever seen any of them being held accountable for that.
[00:50:51.728 --> 00:50:52.529]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:56.811]  Just like the slide just showed, H-I-A-S.
[00:50:56.871 --> 00:51:06.576]  Todd Benson right now is in the Darien Gap, showing how that NGO is 100% assisting and facilitating the invasion of the United States.
[00:51:07.416 --> 00:51:14.760]  And so he's there right now, just trying to blow the lid on that organization, just as our friend
[00:51:16.261 --> 00:51:16.802]  I think so.
[00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:36.240]  It's coming from our wallet.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.941]  We are the ones who are funding the invasion.
[00:51:38.981 --> 00:51:41.142]  We're the ones who are funding human trafficking.
[00:51:41.202 --> 00:51:44.843]  We're the ones who are funding all of this, all the nefarious activities.
[00:51:44.883 --> 00:51:46.504]  We're funding our own destruction.
[00:51:47.364 --> 00:51:49.665]  Okay, Eamon, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:51:49.745 --> 00:51:57.708]  It's always a great pleasure for me to talk to you because I learn so much from you, and I know that everything comes from what you have seen with your own eyes.
[00:51:57.768 --> 00:51:58.728]  You're like me.
[00:51:58.768 --> 00:52:00.549]  We like first-hand sources for our news.
[00:52:01.229 --> 00:52:02.150]  Okay, and... Yes, ma'am.
[00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:11.570]  Coming up on InfoWars, we're coming up with a break now, and when we come back after the break, we have a guest that you have never heard from before.
[00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.271]  I know this because she works undercover in the counter-trafficking world.
[00:52:15.611 --> 00:52:20.913]  This is, we're going to take it from the border to your homes, your communities, your schools, and your children.
[00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:24.995]  And this is something that is very close to my own heart.
[00:52:25.515 --> 00:52:28.676]  Coming up on InfoWars, I'm Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:52:39.744 --> 00:52:52.532]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:52:52.992 --> 00:52:55.194]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:52:56.034 --> 00:53:01.438]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:02.498 --> 00:53:11.060]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.260]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.381]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full force.
[00:53:19.102 --> 00:53:24.763]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:24.783 --> 00:53:27.663]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:28.484 --> 00:53:30.004]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:53:31.229 --> 00:53:47.244]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:54.291]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:53:55.425 --> 00:54:06.258]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:54:07.262 --> 00:54:15.366]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:15.446 --> 00:54:22.089]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:22.249 --> 00:54:24.730]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:26.811]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:27.011 --> 00:54:36.799]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:39.821]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:40.942]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:42.603 --> 00:54:49.324]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:49.424 --> 00:54:55.106]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:54:55.186 --> 00:55:03.707]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.848]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:55:05.868 --> 00:55:05.988]  And
[00:55:07.478 --> 00:55:20.761]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:25.642]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:25.702 --> 00:55:30.343]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:31.364 --> 00:55:36.607]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:36.687 --> 00:55:37.308]  It's amazing.
[00:55:37.428 --> 00:55:38.348]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:38.428 --> 00:55:40.270]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:01.083]  Thank you.
[00:56:29.935 --> 00:56:31.897]  We are back at InfoWars.
[00:56:32.037 --> 00:56:34.378]  I'm Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:56:34.679 --> 00:56:47.689]  And one of the things that was making kind of news across social media was on the one year anniversary of the very strange but devastating fires in Maui.
[00:56:48.129 --> 00:56:48.289]  Is it?
[00:57:08.991 --> 00:57:12.413]  Significant questions about what really happened there.
[00:57:12.493 --> 00:57:21.157]  It's a year later and the devastation to that community has pretty much been glossed over and forgotten.
[00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:27.260]  So we just wanted to remind everybody that we're looking at a year since the devastating fires in Maui.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.084]  And something's still really odd that these IEDs are coming up.
[00:57:31.364 --> 00:57:35.308]  Makes you want to ask the question, is somebody trying to get rid of these people?
[00:57:35.368 --> 00:57:39.152]  Is anybody trying to force these people to abandon that island?
[00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:46.740]  Because they sure have been through a lot, and we know absolutely nothing about what really happened there all this time later.
[00:57:47.481 --> 00:58:03.239]  So now, moving on from that, for our next segment coming up, we're going to talk to somebody that I have known for a number of years, who works very closely alongside law enforcement in the counter-trafficking arena.
[00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:05.161]  We can't show you her face.
[00:58:06.002 --> 00:58:16.132]  Um, because she works undercover, and we have altered her voice to protect her identity, but I am very familiar with her operations.
[00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:28.745]  She has been responsible for some of the most significant busts in the history of counter-trafficking, and her work on the front line is something that
[00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:31.930]  We'll change how you look at all of this.
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:36.111]  And if you're a mom or a dad, it's really going to bother you a lot.
[00:58:38.112 --> 00:58:41.993]  One of the areas I want to start with is media grooming.
[00:58:42.053 --> 00:58:50.555]  And I want to show you an article from the Guardian newspaper, which is a leftist publication out of the UK, that is all about furries.
[00:58:51.255 --> 00:58:54.096]  OK, and furries is something kind of odd, kind of weird.
[00:58:54.517 --> 00:58:59.599]  Nobody really wants to talk about it in the mainstream, but it is very much part of the gaming community.
[00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:08.203]  It's part of the TikTok world and the YouTube world, and it's part of what surrounds all of our children today.
[00:59:08.563 --> 00:59:12.425]  And so what you see is a form of media grooming.
[00:59:12.905 --> 00:59:15.826]  That was published in The Guardian.
[00:59:16.166 --> 00:59:17.186]  I'm calling it media grooming.
[00:59:17.206 --> 00:59:18.867]  That's the term I'm making up.
[00:59:19.167 --> 00:59:23.328]  Because this article is all about how there's nothing to see here.
[00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:36.913]  You know, just because you got a bunch of adults dressing up as furries, don't listen to those far-right people that tell you that this is somehow connected to trafficking and the trance movement and pedophilia because they're far-right crazies, right?
[00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:40.594]  And we all know that we should pay attention to them.
[00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:43.956]  Uh, lest you be called, you know, prejudiced in some way.
[00:59:43.976 --> 00:59:59.128]  Um, but why I wanted to bring this to you is that, is that our next guest has seen the other side of that world firsthand and just in the last few days rescued a young boy.
[00:59:59.989 --> 01:00:00.769]  From that world.
[01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:12.354]  Who was autistic, by the way, because it's another thing we don't talk about, how much these communities prey, how much the trafficking is targeted towards the most vulnerable of our kids.
[01:00:12.374 --> 01:00:23.759]  So I want to bring in our guest here to tell you, to give you a sense of the reality from her perspective, what she has actually seen on the street.
[01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:25.079]  Do we have Jackie?
[01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:26.060]  Is she with us?
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.081]  Okay.
[01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:29.081]  Yes, I'm here.
[01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:31.485]  Jackie, welcome to the show.
[01:00:31.585 --> 01:00:34.486]  I know this is a big deal for you.
[01:00:35.226 --> 01:00:37.567]  You don't like to be out in front of this.
[01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:42.468]  All of your work is pretty much in the shadows and much of it in the dark, literally.
[01:00:42.908 --> 01:00:56.711]  So, can you give us a sense from your perspective, right, when you see articles like this that are out there that are normalizing the world of furries, gives a history as it being kind of a nerdy thing, it's kind of a friendly thing.
[01:00:57.151 --> 01:01:03.155]  It's a nice community and why should we pay attention to people who are warning?
[01:01:03.295 --> 01:01:05.016]  And we are back at InfoWars.
[01:01:05.076 --> 01:01:06.917]  I'm Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:01:07.157 --> 01:01:17.123]  Our next guest is somebody you will never have heard from, who is a very significant person working undercover alongside law enforcement and counter-trafficking.
[01:01:17.604 --> 01:01:20.886]  She knows from first-hand experience what she is talking about.
[01:01:21.526 --> 01:01:25.027]  And, Jackie, what we wanted to ask you about, thank you for agreeing to do this.
[01:01:25.368 --> 01:01:33.791]  I know you can't show your face for your own security and also the security of your investigations, but we appreciate being able to hear from you.
[01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:49.797]  Can you take us, first of all, right into this world of furries and anime and gaming that is very much a part of the trafficking organizations that you deal with on a daily basis?
[01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:54.481]  Well, I think it's a misnomer.
[01:01:55.001 --> 01:02:01.726]  Bleeding in anime and the furry, furry dough is all an innocence, but it is absolutely not.
[01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:06.990]  When you look at the most vulnerable of our society, it is going to be children.
[01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.812]  It is going to be children that are
[01:02:09.612 --> 01:02:10.113]  I don't
[01:02:27.668 --> 01:02:28.028]  I don't know.
[01:02:48.702 --> 01:02:57.907]  And these are very adult conversations, adult materials that our kids are now getting access to because they're connecting with these groups.
[01:02:58.167 --> 01:02:59.488]  And they're not innocent.
[01:02:59.528 --> 01:03:00.649]  It's actually very dangerous.
[01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:04.611]  And we're seeing it a lot in trafficking because they're pulling kids in.
[01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:05.851]  We're good to go.
[01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:27.788]  So you're talking about, you know, the furry world right on the surface.
[01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:31.130]  It looks like there's nothing there really for parents to worry about.
[01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:35.412]  But that's right adjacent to the anime world.
[01:03:35.692 --> 01:03:37.353]  And then you mentioned hentai.
[01:03:38.574 --> 01:03:44.337]  Can you explain what that is for people who aren't necessarily familiar with that kind of terminology?
[01:03:47.276 --> 01:03:51.161]  Um, it's anime and it's extreme graphic sex.
[01:03:51.882 --> 01:03:57.248]  And it's, you know, sometimes there's AI-generated pictures in there.
[01:03:57.268 --> 01:04:03.616]  And when it comes to the fantasy world of what these people see and what these people interact with,
[01:04:04.156 --> 01:04:10.179]  You know, even in the furry world, you could be dealing with somebody that just likes to dress up in costumes and go to Comic-Con.
[01:04:10.939 --> 01:04:14.501]  It goes from that to people that believe in zoophilia, which is bestiality.
[01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:18.242]  It's people that have sex in their costumes.
[01:04:18.402 --> 01:04:23.004]  It's people that host cartoon animal characters having graphic sex.
[01:04:24.565 --> 01:04:27.546]  It's a different world than what you see on the surface.
[01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:31.767]  Most people don't know that this exists unless they actually go out there to research it.
[01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:36.168]  The problem is that your kids do see it, and they do have access to it.
[01:04:36.228 --> 01:04:45.811]  You can go to Vulcan forums on Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and you can see these characters having sex, graphic sex.
[01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:46.972]  I think so.
[01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:15.076]  So one of the things we're looking at right here is a Facebook group called Furry Love, which is all about furries and a furry community.
[01:05:15.336 --> 01:05:24.140]  We had to blur it out because this is an artist drawing that somebody in that group created, but it's too pornographic for us to show on air.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:33.784]  And if you read the conversation below, you see that they're talking about furry communities on Discord, but also talking about
[01:05:35.024 --> 01:05:39.147]  People who are disabled and asking questions about that, raising it.
[01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:46.070]  I think there's one term, there's ADPL or something, Adult Baby Diaper Love, ABDL.
[01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:52.373]  I mean, and one of the users in that group makes the point that there are minors in that group.
[01:05:53.254 --> 01:05:57.536]  And so how common is this on social media sites like Facebook?
[01:05:59.687 --> 01:06:01.829]  Well, you can pull it up probably.
[01:06:02.049 --> 01:06:06.672]  I would say anywhere between 50 to 60 groups that deal with this.
[01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:07.873]  And that's just Facebook.
[01:06:07.893 --> 01:06:09.975]  A lot of your minors aren't even on Facebook.
[01:06:09.995 --> 01:06:12.156]  They're on Snapchat and TikTok.
[01:06:12.216 --> 01:06:14.318]  But there are a few that probably trickle in there.
[01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:21.620]  But the fact that they even have minors engaged in this conversation is what's disgusting.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:29.823]  Because if you take an average person or not, you know, when we talk about kids talking to adults about sex, it's, you know, it's an exploitation.
[01:06:29.883 --> 01:06:42.207]  But in this furry community of an anime, I'm not sure why we're not doing more of a target, you know, and looking at the sources of where this information comes from and watching some of these people that want to engage with minors.
[01:06:42.648 --> 01:06:43.168]  You know, it's...
[01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:59.292]  Peeling back the layers and looking at these people and where they are in the gaming community and talking to these kids on Discord and getting into chat rooms and then you go back and you look at some of the conversations that they have on other platforms and the things that they describe.
[01:06:59.332 --> 01:07:08.234]  They describe hypnotizing minors, they describe having sex with minors, doping minors, sexually assaulting minors.
[01:07:08.974 --> 01:07:24.064]  And, you know, that might be part of their fantasy, but what happens when they break out of that fantasy and they next level it up and they can no longer be sexually gratified by talking about it or drawing pictures or creating images in AI and they act out, you know, with that minor.
[01:07:24.685 --> 01:07:27.186]  That's what we really need to be watching and need to be concerned about.
[01:07:28.107 --> 01:07:34.090]  So, Jackie, I mean, your point is not that every person who is a furry is a pedophile.
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:34.990]  I'm far from it.
[01:07:35.371 --> 01:07:45.295]  What you're trying to say is that, what you are saying is that this community, right, is used as a cover by people who are pedophiles.
[01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:48.717]  And they use, this is a, is this a form of grooming?
[01:07:49.117 --> 01:07:50.098]  Is that what we're looking at?
[01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:52.301]  Oh, of course.
[01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:57.043]  I mean, you know, you have to think about people that try to connect them with minors, right?
[01:07:57.223 --> 01:08:02.965]  And you find them in all levels of, you know, minor activities and minor interests.
[01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:10.407]  When you look at the gaming community and kids, you know, the gaming world becomes their social outreach.
[01:08:10.467 --> 01:08:13.248]  Those become their online friends, almost their family.
[01:08:14.088 --> 01:08:21.556]  And they start having conversations about transgendering, and sex, and gender modification.
[01:08:21.577 --> 01:08:24.540]  It builds into a very weird state.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.487]  And when we've looked at some of these gaming developers, and we've looked at some of the people interacting with these kids, that's exactly what they're a part of.
[01:08:32.369 --> 01:08:46.729]  And they're using this furry world or this anime world to connect with these kids and then they start having conversations with them about sexuality and, you know, misgendering and gender dysphoria and gender modification.
[01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:50.492]  Which absolutely has nothing to do with the game that you're playing online.
[01:08:50.552 --> 01:08:53.134]  So they've used this as an inroad.
[01:08:53.154 --> 01:09:01.000]  And I'm not saying that everybody in that community is part of this pedophilia network, but the pedophiles have absolutely found a way in.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:11.988]  And they found you could be in a living room with your kids, and you're on the computer, and they're on their computer, and you think they're just playing a game, and these monsters are in your living room.
[01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:13.748]  That's what's scary.
[01:09:14.148 --> 01:09:18.630]  Yeah so that's that is very scary for for any parent because look at this what we got up here.
[01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:24.292]  Bucks County man ordered held trial for trial on child rape charges during furry party.
[01:09:24.592 --> 01:09:39.797]  So this is what's interesting about this case is it is it it shows you how it's adults dressed as furries having a party that are passing around this eight-year-old boy who was raped repeatedly over a number of years and there's a bunch in that thing there's a bunch of other men
[01:09:40.177 --> 01:09:40.877]  We're good to go.
[01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:05.186]  Sexual intercourse with a child, unlawful contact with a minor, and related charges.
[01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:08.368]  And another one, charged with bestiality and animal cruelty.
[01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:09.768]  That's another pedophile.
[01:10:09.808 --> 01:10:19.211]  In that ring, in that bust of men who were using, dressing up as furries and raping children and animals at these furry parties.
[01:10:19.811 --> 01:10:23.332]  And that's, you know, that's a reality, right?
[01:10:23.372 --> 01:10:27.774]  In fact, at Comic Con, you mentioned that early on, there was just a child
[01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:32.916]  I mean, a trafficking ring was busted at the most recent Comic-Con conference.
[01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:37.617]  There were a number of people arrested, and I believe ten victims.
[01:10:37.697 --> 01:10:45.840]  At least one of them is a 16-year-old girl who was freed when they broke up that pedophile ring at Comic-Con.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:54.663]  So what you see here is a pattern where traffickers are using, you know, comics, anime, the furry community, transgenderism.
[01:10:55.323 --> 01:11:11.228]  Everything this it's a community that they can infiltrate and they target the most vulnerable and Parents have no idea that when they open the door to these worlds They are opening up the door to some of the most evil people on earth.
[01:11:11.728 --> 01:11:12.688]  Is that accurate?
[01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:19.070]  It's very accurate and it's it's something that I think a community
[01:11:20.037 --> 01:11:20.537]  That works.
[01:11:37.267 --> 01:11:37.587]  I don't know.
[01:11:56.202 --> 01:12:11.495]  And you are gaining their trust, and you're acting out on these games as these characters, and you're engaging in this false narrative world, and you're using, you know, cute little furry creatures to cartoon.
[01:12:11.655 --> 01:12:22.403]  Just something these kids can connect to that gives them a safe space to be themselves without having to go to a party, and they're accepted, and these people gain their trust.
[01:12:22.684 --> 01:12:24.145]  It's what pedophiles do.
[01:12:24.765 --> 01:12:25.606]  It's what traffickers
[01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:30.608]  Let's talk about the one thing that is probably the most underreported about this.
[01:12:30.628 --> 01:12:33.370]  It is how much boys are the target.
[01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:37.051]  I know you were just involved in the rescue of an autistic boy.
[01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:55.463]  And that prompted you and I to have a conversation about this.
[01:12:55.483 --> 01:12:57.886]  There are different categories of boys, right?
[01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:05.194]  You have femboys, B.O.I., and you have twinks, right, which is another form.
[01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:11.802]  Can you just explain what these categories are and what they mean and how vulnerable boys are in particular?
[01:13:14.633 --> 01:13:18.874]  There's some reason this fandom targets boys more than they do girls.
[01:13:19.274 --> 01:13:32.558]  And most people don't understand in the world of trafficking that a trans kid or a trans person will garner three times the amount of a normal child as far as money.
[01:13:32.578 --> 01:13:36.419]  And the number one purveyor of that is couples.
[01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.880]  So that sounds bizarre, I know.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.301]  It is something that we see far more.
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:44.241]  I just want to be clear, I understand this.
[01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:56.084]  So trans kids are worth three times what a normal kid is, a heterosexual kid is, on the street in the trafficking world right now.
[01:13:57.144 --> 01:13:57.664]  Is that right?
[01:13:57.904 --> 01:13:58.264]  Correct.
[01:13:58.724 --> 01:14:05.866]  And the number one customer that is hiring or buying trans kids is married couples?
[01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:08.920]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:14:10.082 --> 01:14:25.118]  And the fantasy part of this is they have a boy that has transitioned to a girl and the third boy is a sissy boy and if you get it, I guess in those terms,
[01:14:25.899 --> 01:14:26.179]  I think?
[01:14:43.142 --> 01:14:44.323]  We're good to go.
[01:15:02.074 --> 01:15:06.838]  But we see the boys targeted far more in this realm than girls.
[01:15:06.938 --> 01:15:11.442]  Most of the time when people talk about trafficking, they think of it as being minor females.
[01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:22.392]  When it comes to this world of transgenderism and twins and semi-boys and the furry culture, the biggest target is actually boys.
[01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.494]  And what do you do with boys?
[01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:25.655]  Is there anywhere for them to go?
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.841]  There are very few safe houses out there for boys.
[01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:32.441]  They need to have more.
[01:15:33.121 --> 01:15:40.323]  They need to actually look at developing safe houses that would be one-person units for the transgender kids.
[01:15:41.263 --> 01:15:49.265]  They do need a safe place to go because I can tell you that depending upon the age of them, a lot of them are not even being picked up and taken into safety.
[01:15:50.525 --> 01:15:57.267]  Seventeen-year-olds seem to be falling through the cracks because they're considered to be an age of consent, even though they're still in high school.
[01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.788]  And, you know, these kids don't have a safe place to land.
[01:16:00.828 --> 01:16:02.229]  A lot of them end up on the street.
[01:16:02.909 --> 01:16:05.851]  I've watched one particular case for the last four years.
[01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:07.211]  It started out as a minor.
[01:16:08.112 --> 01:16:10.373]  They kept skipping around with no place to go.
[01:16:11.173 --> 01:16:13.654]  And, you know, they're now adult.
[01:16:14.155 --> 01:16:17.396]  And it's sad because they're still out on the street and there's still traffic.
[01:16:17.456 --> 01:16:19.037]  I mean, it's just, it's horrible.
[01:16:19.957 --> 01:16:29.422]  You know, the sad part about this is our society has blinders on and we need to open up our eyes and look at this as not being a harmless activity.
[01:16:29.442 --> 01:16:38.827]  Not everybody involved in these worlds is dark, but they are using these worlds, the dark people are, to gain access to your kids.
[01:16:39.187 --> 01:16:46.431]  So we need to be monitoring closely those discords, those chat rooms, the games that they're playing, the people that they're talking to.
[01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:52.573]  So what are the number one ways?
[01:16:52.613 --> 01:16:54.314]  I know you've mentioned Discord a lot.
[01:16:54.374 --> 01:16:55.895]  That's for the gaming community.
[01:16:57.015 --> 01:16:59.476]  TikTok, I'm guessing, is a big way.
[01:17:00.276 --> 01:17:03.778]  Where should parents be most concerned and most aware?
[01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:09.515]  Well, I think the top three right now are Discord, Snapchat, and TikTok.
[01:17:10.036 --> 01:17:20.909]  And the reason I say that is that when we go in and train and talk to kids, you know, we usually talk to them for about less than three minutes about the apps that we recommend that they avoid.
[01:17:21.409 --> 01:17:27.031]  And then we turn the floor over to them, and we basically give them the mic and say, teach us.
[01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:29.092]  Tell us where you've been approached.
[01:17:29.132 --> 01:17:30.952]  Tell us where people have been inappropriate.
[01:17:30.992 --> 01:17:33.173]  Tell us where people have tried to recruit you.
[01:17:33.673 --> 01:17:38.415]  Where you've seen things that have offended you or made you feel like people were stalking you.
[01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:46.257]  Hands down, every single environment we're in, Discord is number one, followed by Snapchat, TikTok, and then Omegle.
[01:17:46.798 --> 01:17:53.140]  And so, the kids are the ones that are telling us that this is where they're going, and a lot of them feel unsafe.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.701]  And this is where we have the predators stalking them in these channels.
[01:17:58.462 --> 01:18:04.364]  And as adults, you know, we need to be monitoring these transactions and then finding out who these people are and hold them accountable.
[01:18:05.385 --> 01:18:07.867]  And are any of these platforms held accountable?
[01:18:08.287 --> 01:18:10.469]  Would that be something that would be helpful to you?
[01:18:10.509 --> 01:18:12.871]  I mean, how do you deal with this?
[01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:14.933]  What's the number one thing you want to see happen?
[01:18:16.514 --> 01:18:34.589]  Well, I think social media, I mean, becomes so, you know, polarized in politics, and it's amazing to me the things that they will take down off of social media, but they'll leave channels like this up that clearly has cartoon porn, and then sometimes you'll see a blip of human porn on there.
[01:18:35.429 --> 01:18:36.691]  And it's an open channel.
[01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:44.440]  I mean, yes, you need to join the group, but anybody can log into one of these Facebook groups and they can see the stuff scroll by.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.484]  They can't comment on it because they haven't joined the group, but they can see it.
[01:18:48.587 --> 01:18:52.791]  And if that means that, you know, it's an open channel, that means any minor can see it.
[01:18:53.392 --> 01:18:54.313]  And it's not harmless.
[01:18:54.933 --> 01:18:58.757]  You know, anime porn, hentai, furry porn is still porn.
[01:18:58.957 --> 01:19:04.823]  And it's still planting the seed in a child's mind of sexual activity and sexual gratification that doesn't need to be there.
[01:19:05.103 --> 01:19:10.889]  We don't need to be having conversations about heterosexual or homosexual sex with an 8-year-old child.
[01:19:12.688 --> 01:19:15.635]  And what happens to the traffickers?
[01:19:16.597 --> 01:19:22.149]  I mean, how effective is law enforcement when it comes to the traffickers themselves?
[01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:33.209]  I think the traffickers are being arrested and law enforcement, I believe in a lot of areas, is doing the best job that they can.
[01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:46.182]  The number one thing that I would be pushing for right now is to make these traffickers register as sex offenders because they are not registering as sex offenders and they're getting back out on the street and they're repeating their deeds.
[01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:50.866]  Uh, some of them might switch from trafficking on the street to trafficking online.
[01:19:51.406 --> 01:20:04.836]  And if we have them registering as sex offenders, whether they get, you know, two days, two years, two hundred years, we have this, uh, penalty attached to them, and now they have to register just like somebody that's, you know, involved in child exploitation.
[01:20:05.597 --> 01:20:15.064]  And, you know, grooming online, and trying to get kids to meet you and send you nudes, and they should have the book thrown at them, just like any other predator.
[01:20:16.485 --> 01:20:20.486]  Unfortunately, it's where the trafficking laws need to catch up with the times.
[01:20:20.806 --> 01:20:32.810]  We're a little bit behind, but I think we have a lot of good people out there in this movement right now that are seeing this, and we're bringing this awareness to legislators and hoping that we can get some laws passed so that we can start making a real difference.
[01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:40.413]  But as a parent, you really need to be monitoring and looking at your child's activity, because the furries in the anime world is not harmless.
[01:20:40.453 --> 01:20:44.074]  They can be sucked into a very dark world very quickly.
[01:20:44.394 --> 01:20:46.497]  Because the pedophiles are hiding in there, those channels.
[01:20:46.998 --> 01:20:48.941]  Is this kind of an ungoverned space?
[01:20:49.341 --> 01:20:54.890]  I mean, is this something that law enforcement are not really, you know, local police officers are not really equipped to deal with?
[01:20:55.230 --> 01:21:00.378]  I mean, how vulnerable are our kids once they get sucked into this world?
[01:21:03.328 --> 01:21:14.463]  Well, a lot of times people look at online activity and they believe that that's harmless activity unless they have actually exchanged photos or asked for a photo or committed physical crime.
[01:21:14.483 --> 01:21:21.352]  And when people are fantasizing openly about raping children or tying them down or drugging them,
[01:21:22.012 --> 01:21:22.453]  I don't know.
[01:21:45.954 --> 01:21:59.097]  Jackie, what do you say to people who want to paint this as a right-wing slur against innocent communities and push back against this and say, you know, there's really nothing to see here?
[01:22:01.992 --> 01:22:05.834]  Well, to politicize this is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:22:05.934 --> 01:22:09.536]  I have never seen a predator ask children, how do your parents vote?
[01:22:09.936 --> 01:22:11.116]  What church do you go to?
[01:22:11.456 --> 01:22:12.657]  What nationality are you?
[01:22:13.617 --> 01:22:14.178]  They don't care.
[01:22:14.238 --> 01:22:15.038]  They want your children.
[01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:17.439]  You know, this is a bipartisan issue.
[01:22:17.459 --> 01:22:20.160]  We need to be pulling together because these are all of our kids.
[01:22:20.601 --> 01:22:25.223]  And these predators do not care if your parents vote Democrat or Republican.
[01:22:26.744 --> 01:22:31.886]  They have basically hijacked the LGBTQIA by trying to hide underneath their flag.
[01:22:31.906 --> 01:22:35.828]  And I know a lot of people in that community that are appalled by this.
[01:22:36.348 --> 01:22:40.490]  There's a lot of people out there that are going to do everything they can to bring these monsters down.
[01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:43.972]  We just have to pull together and not let them divide us on this topic.
[01:22:45.373 --> 01:22:47.433]  Thank you so much for talking to us, Jackie.
[01:22:47.453 --> 01:22:48.874]  We're going to take a short break.
[01:22:49.054 --> 01:22:52.935]  We will be back coming up on InfoWars after the break.
[01:22:53.255 --> 01:23:05.558]  We will be discussing Tommy Robinson's latest from the riots in the UK and breaking down what has happened to press freedom and freedom of speech in the United Kingdom.
[01:23:06.018 --> 01:23:10.319]  Is that a bad sign for what we can expect to see here in the United States?
[01:23:11.099 --> 01:23:11.959]  Nitric boost.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:13.380]  Turmeric 95.
[01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:18.579]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:24.501]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:23:24.982 --> 01:23:32.144]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:23:32.705 --> 01:23:34.685]  They let us private label their products.
[01:23:34.705 --> 01:23:35.586]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:23:37.807 --> 01:23:40.569]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:23:40.809 --> 01:23:42.110]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:45.773]  And so it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:23:46.153 --> 01:23:46.774]  That's the name.
[01:23:47.034 --> 01:23:52.698]  So we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is again the same concentrated
[01:23:53.198 --> 01:23:53.499]  Tumeric.
[01:23:53.739 --> 01:23:54.800]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.842]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[01:23:56.882 --> 01:23:58.904]  They even let us use their name.
[01:23:59.184 --> 01:24:00.185]  It's now our best seller.
[01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:01.386]  We sold out of our version.
[01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:03.108]  Their version has a white model.
[01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:04.850]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:06.952]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:07.212 --> 01:24:09.655]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:10.852 --> 01:24:18.374]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:24:19.014 --> 01:24:21.275]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:28.416]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:24:28.436 --> 01:24:31.957]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:24:32.437 --> 01:24:38.619]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:48.182]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[01:24:48.402 --> 01:24:57.505]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:24:57.885 --> 01:24:59.005]  These are very, very popular.
[01:24:59.045 --> 01:25:00.105]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:25:00.505 --> 01:25:01.746]  It is very, very popular.
[01:25:02.046 --> 01:25:02.966]  It's not an investment.
[01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:03.786]  It's a collectible.
[01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:06.927]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[01:25:07.467 --> 01:25:10.871]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:25:11.331 --> 01:25:15.336]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:25:15.596 --> 01:25:19.620]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:27.929]  Then the bankruptcy started, and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.831]  And they kicked him back
[01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:34.707]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:25:35.007 --> 01:25:46.054]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:55.059]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:25:55.559 --> 01:26:05.804]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[01:26:06.205 --> 01:26:07.705]  They're amazing cards.
[01:26:08.046 --> 01:26:09.867]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:26:09.947 --> 01:26:12.328]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:26:12.848 --> 01:26:15.489]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:26:15.809 --> 01:26:21.831]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, for your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:26:21.851 --> 01:26:23.491]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:26:23.891 --> 01:26:27.712]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:26:28.073 --> 01:26:29.373]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:26:30.033 --> 01:26:32.936]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:26:33.496 --> 01:26:36.499]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:41.724]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:26:42.104 --> 01:26:44.206]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:26:45.007 --> 01:26:50.972]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:51.593]  I want to be clear.
[01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:54.355]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.156]  That's not what this is.
[01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.197]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:26:56.801 --> 01:27:09.904]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5 or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:27:10.184 --> 01:27:11.084]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:27:11.824 --> 01:27:16.245]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11.
[01:27:16.325 --> 01:27:16.646]  And so the other
[01:27:19.224 --> 01:27:22.205]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[01:27:22.245 --> 01:27:25.367]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:33.590]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:35.051]  The decision is yours.
[01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:36.512]  This is a limited edition.
[01:27:36.532 --> 01:27:38.292]  It's something that people like.
[01:27:38.773 --> 01:27:39.373]  It's popular.
[01:27:40.133 --> 01:27:42.115]  And it's something that's collectible.
[01:27:42.135 --> 01:27:52.323]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time that myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:27:52.804 --> 01:28:01.711]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:28:02.071 --> 01:28:02.952]  Thank you for your support.
[01:28:03.313 --> 01:28:04.954]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:09.353]  Yeah.
[01:28:11.138 --> 01:28:15.442]  Welcome back to InfoWars, I'm Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:28:15.502 --> 01:28:25.250]  Now there's a subject that Alex and I talked about a little bit this morning, something he's discussed a lot on this show, and that is what is happening in the UK.
[01:28:25.290 --> 01:28:38.802]  Because Europe, we've talked a lot about the border during the last few hours, and what we're seeing in Europe is the result of an open border policy to immigration in the United Kingdom and across Europe.
[01:28:39.122 --> 01:29:03.321]  So, we want to show you there's an analysis that came out on British TV, I believe it is, that sums up what has been happening from the perspective of ordinary people who are being demonized in the United Kingdom by the media and by their leaders, incredibly, as being far-right, just because they want to ask questions and speak up in demand.
[01:29:03.842 --> 01:29:04.122]  Thank you.
[01:29:15.595 --> 01:29:22.280]  I think that there is a concerted attempt now to pull the wool over your eyes about what's really going on in this country.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.083]  You were told to expect 100 far-right protests last night.
[01:29:26.703 --> 01:29:29.125]  That whipped up a huge amount of fear.
[01:29:29.805 --> 01:29:36.810]  One of the people whipping up some of that fear, arguably, was the director of hard-left Hope Not Hate group, who this morning tweeted...
[01:29:37.731 --> 01:29:39.832]  Yes, this list, i.e.
[01:29:39.872 --> 01:29:44.254]  the list of locations that were expected to be attacked, this list was a hoax.
[01:29:44.895 --> 01:29:47.376]  But just look at the front pages of today's papers.
[01:29:47.756 --> 01:29:51.738]  An anti-racist message is being transmitted to millions of homes this morning.
[01:29:52.098 --> 01:29:55.140]  Well, he later went some way to retracting that tweet.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.742]  But let's just have a look at those newspaper front pages and headlines, shall we?
[01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:05.265]  So, I strongly suspect that the Daily Mail and the Deli Express came under huge commercial pressure here.
[01:30:05.725 --> 01:30:06.086]  Don't you?
[01:30:07.287 --> 01:30:12.295]  Then, this morning, out strolls our Met Police Chief, Mark Rowley, like the cat who got the cream.
[01:30:13.557 --> 01:30:15.239]  It was a massive policing operation.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.242]  I'm really pleased with how it went.
[01:30:17.783 --> 01:30:21.489]  We put thousands of officers on the streets and I think the show of force from the police
[01:30:22.268 --> 01:30:28.811]  And frankly the show of unity from communities together defeated the challenges that we've seen.
[01:30:28.831 --> 01:30:31.032]  It went off very peacefully last night.
[01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:36.495]  A couple of locations we had some local criminals turn out and try and create a bit of antisocial behaviour and we arrested a few of them.
[01:30:37.235 --> 01:30:43.158]  But it was a very successful night and the fears of extreme right disorder were abated.
[01:30:44.262 --> 01:30:47.364]  Firstly, we can't call what happened last night counter-protest.
[01:30:47.684 --> 01:30:49.506]  Because there was nothing to protest about, was there?
[01:30:49.626 --> 01:30:50.066]  What was it?
[01:30:50.306 --> 01:30:51.487]  The ghost of the EDL?
[01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:52.007]  Was it?
[01:30:52.368 --> 01:30:59.352]  Secondly, the country's top cop has just given the green light to people to come out in force on the street and mob up, in my view.
[01:30:59.632 --> 01:31:01.774]  We saw very hard-left radicals there.
[01:31:01.814 --> 01:31:03.555]  That's according to their flag that they've got.
[01:31:03.595 --> 01:31:04.936]  They were out in Brighton.
[01:31:05.296 --> 01:31:07.338]  There was a huge pro-Palestine presence.
[01:31:07.718 --> 01:31:13.642]  The same group of people who have been rampaging through towns and cities for months now, causing all sorts of problems.
[01:31:14.222 --> 01:31:14.923]  And then there was this.
[01:31:35.351 --> 01:31:37.773]  I want to say thank you all.
[01:31:38.074 --> 01:31:41.336]  I'm going to leave it now.
[01:31:41.436 --> 01:31:41.877]  Free!
[01:31:41.917 --> 01:31:42.237]  Free!
[01:31:42.317 --> 01:31:43.238]  Palestine!
[01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:44.178]  Thank you.
[01:31:44.259 --> 01:31:46.020]  God bless you all.
[01:31:49.173 --> 01:31:54.636]  That is a now suspended Labour councillor who has just been arrested on suspicion of encouraging murder.
[01:31:55.356 --> 01:31:56.957]  And there was this as well.
[01:31:57.477 --> 01:32:04.661]  There have been 10 arrests in Croydon and we're told, look, hey, don't worry, that was nothing to do with any riots or protests.
[01:32:04.761 --> 01:32:07.962]  That was just anti-social behaviour.
[01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:09.263]  Yeah, alright.
[01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:19.130]  So, what happened last night appears to have been a massively exaggerated national threat that brought loads of people out onto the streets with these placards everywhere as well.
[01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:23.053]  You know, the same placards you see all the time, refugees welcome, all of that.
[01:32:23.434 --> 01:32:24.354]  Refugees welcome.
[01:32:24.655 --> 01:32:30.639]  The establishment media then piles in behind it to make it look like the nation fought off the Nazis.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.542]  And now, we've got this going on, haven't we?
[01:32:34.309 --> 01:32:47.797]  We have some breaking news now, and a woman has been arrested by Cheshire Police in relation to an inaccurate information on social media about the attacker in the Southport murders.
[01:32:48.957 --> 01:32:54.941]  And today, Sir Keir Starmer feels that he can shamelessly ignore people's concerns about immigration and just crack on.
[01:32:56.109 --> 01:33:06.095]  If we have indeed turned a corner and seen an end to the violence, is now the time to engage with the underlying tensions that are in communities over the issue of immigration?
[01:33:07.135 --> 01:33:11.478]  The first priority is safety and security of our communities.
[01:33:13.039 --> 01:33:21.824]  The term gaslighting is defined as being to manipulate people using psychological methods into questioning their own sanity or powers of reasoning.
[01:33:22.739 --> 01:33:24.884]  I think we might be being gaslit.
[01:33:25.145 --> 01:33:25.626]  What about you?
[01:33:27.242 --> 01:33:35.208]  So what about that, when you're watching that video about what's happening in the UK feels familiar for Americans, right?
[01:33:35.308 --> 01:33:38.070]  How does it tie in to what we're seeing happen here?
[01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:39.991]  Well, immigration is an issue there.
[01:33:40.111 --> 01:33:41.792]  Border security is an issue.
[01:33:41.892 --> 01:33:45.875]  And what are they doing to crush the conversation about border security?
[01:33:46.355 --> 01:33:49.137]  They are creating a humanitarian crisis.
[01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:51.259]  They're making it a humanitarian issue.
[01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.620]  We love refugees.
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.641]  Can you not love refugees and want to be secure in your homes?
[01:33:57.021 --> 01:34:13.425]  I know you can, because I've spent years reporting on the southern border and something that we don't talk about a lot is that most, the vast majority of border patrol agents, people involved in border security down on the southern border in the state of Texas, for example, are Hispanic Americans.
[01:34:14.025 --> 01:34:22.253]  Many of whom, you know, are first or second generation whose families came here seeking a better life, right?
[01:34:22.333 --> 01:34:29.820]  And so they recognize the threat that's coming from the cartels and they want to be secure and safe in their own homes.
[01:34:30.141 --> 01:34:33.744]  But what is the propaganda narrative that we have to deal with?
[01:34:33.824 --> 01:34:37.988]  Is that somehow there's this binary choice and that if you choose security,
[01:34:38.729 --> 01:34:41.150]  That's somehow a vote against humanity.
[01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:45.191]  That you don't care about people who are coming across who want a better life.
[01:34:45.491 --> 01:34:48.252]  But what did we see on the show today?
[01:34:48.292 --> 01:35:02.496]  We heard from a Border Patrol agent who gave up his entire career because he realized that he was being used by transnational criminal organizations and the federal government to help traffic children.
[01:35:02.876 --> 01:35:06.437]  So instead of bringing them into the United States for a better life,
[01:35:07.037 --> 01:35:12.461]  People across this country still believe that everybody coming here is getting a shot at the American dream.
[01:35:12.901 --> 01:35:18.425]  Well, what if you're a child that's being trafficked by the cartels or a woman, many of them pregnant?
[01:35:18.906 --> 01:35:21.067]  Just look at Texas law enforcement.
[01:35:21.087 --> 01:35:29.754]  They bust open a trafficking ring where women who were eight months pregnant were having to show up every day to a room behind a gas station to be raped all day.
[01:35:30.314 --> 01:35:33.876]  I mean, these are people without conscience who are responsible for this, but somehow
[01:35:54.847 --> 01:36:09.725]  Somehow it strikes me, from the years that I've spent investigating it, that those who are elected into a position of authority, who have the ability to do something about it and lie to the American people, who they're supposed to serve,
[01:36:10.185 --> 01:36:17.252]  That there's a level of evil that comes along with that, that in some ways feels even worse.
[01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:29.423]  And what is striking about the conversation in the UK at the moment is that it's the exact same conversation that we're having all over the world, not just in the United States.
[01:36:29.924 --> 01:36:34.828]  And that tells you that you're looking at the same policies that are being applied.
[01:36:35.769 --> 01:36:42.196]  Which is not a surprise because we're in the midst of an undeclared war that is really a war for your mind.
[01:36:42.216 --> 01:36:46.500]  And a war for your mind plays out primarily in the information space, right?
[01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:51.185]  I mean, that's what we're looking at now, an information war where...
[01:36:51.866 --> 01:37:00.271]  They can create a reality in the digital world that, whether it's true or not, doesn't really matter because of the impact that it has on your life.
[01:37:00.311 --> 01:37:04.573]  So that's what that young man was talking about in the video from GB News.
[01:37:04.914 --> 01:37:16.300]  He was saying they created this big warning, right, that there's going to be all these protests, this massive security threat from the evil far right that's going to take place all across the country.
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:18.201]  And then it doesn't materialize.
[01:37:18.682 --> 01:37:20.743]  Well, how do you even know if that threat was real?
[01:37:21.283 --> 01:37:25.047]  And this is something that I have watched as a journalist.
[01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:28.832]  I have watched this develop in this country for years now.
[01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:30.554]  The great white threat.
[01:37:31.455 --> 01:37:35.179]  This is something that I have been tracking law enforcement bulletins.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:36.960]  I don't
[01:37:53.266 --> 01:38:01.315]  The number of postings that are supposed to be about the white supremacist threat, and you take a look and you say, okay, so I got to figure this out, right?
[01:38:01.656 --> 01:38:03.138]  I want to know if this is real or not.
[01:38:03.458 --> 01:38:04.339]  Where is it coming from?
[01:38:04.399 --> 01:38:05.480]  Who's responsible for it?
[01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:08.163]  And this is the normal process of being a journalist.
[01:38:08.544 --> 01:38:11.507]  But when you take a look at it, what you find a lot of the time is
[01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.750]  We're good to go.
[01:38:33.971 --> 01:38:35.992]  Right, it fell apart in court, actually.
[01:38:36.533 --> 01:38:38.094]  And why did it fall apart?
[01:38:38.114 --> 01:38:39.495]  Because it was manufactured.
[01:38:39.875 --> 01:38:47.620]  None of the people who were supposed to be supposed to be plotting to kidnap the governor had any real interest in kidnapping the governor.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:55.425]  So much so that even in a time where there's a lot of political pressure to prove this narrative to be true, it falls apart.
[01:38:56.505 --> 01:39:01.989]  In the court systems, and we know that there aren't a lot of judges lining up to go against the political narrative of the day.
[01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:03.771]  It takes courage to do that.
[01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:06.293]  And we don't see it often enough.
[01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:10.115]  So when you see a case like that fall apart, you know it was really, really bad, right?
[01:39:10.155 --> 01:39:11.697]  I mean, that's what it tells you.
[01:39:12.157 --> 01:39:13.378]  You can look at the court records.
[01:39:13.858 --> 01:39:18.541]  You know, one of these gentlemen who was accused of being a kidnapper, he was homeless.
[01:39:18.642 --> 01:39:20.403]  I believe he was living in his parents' basement.
[01:39:20.783 --> 01:39:31.026]  And they gave him a, um, one of the FBI agents that was, I don't know how they didn't get charged for entrapment, but that was involved in creating this fake plot, offered him a credit card.
[01:39:31.306 --> 01:39:31.966]  I think it was about $5,000.
[01:39:32.146 --> 01:39:37.568]  It was prepaid and he was, they were giving it to him to go and buy weapons and he wouldn't do it.
[01:39:38.584 --> 01:39:46.951]  He was that uninterested in kidnapping the governor that he would not even take a handout, okay, from one of these people.
[01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:59.322]  So, I mean, it's laughable in one sense, but it's extremely disturbing in another sense, because it ties back to what our guest from the Texas Public Policy Foundation, Eamon Blair, said.
[01:40:00.043 --> 01:40:02.124]  This is the first time in history, right?
[01:40:02.184 --> 01:40:12.930]  Weaponized migration is not new, but it's the first time in the history of this country that we have ever seen the government of this country use that weapon against its own people.
[01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:15.611]  And that's the same thing that's happening.
[01:40:15.651 --> 01:40:20.414]  It's the same tactic when you talk about white supremacists and the great white threat and
[01:40:20.774 --> 01:40:36.319]  You know, you condemn parents as domestic terrorists because they're concerned about what's happening with their kids inside the schools and they want to go to a school board meeting and challenge the people in the form that we're told we're supposed to use to address these issues.
[01:40:36.679 --> 01:40:42.141]  You go there to address them and suddenly, you know, you've got the attorney general that's looking and the FBI is looking at you as a
[01:40:42.521 --> 01:40:42.721]  I don't
[01:41:00.618 --> 01:41:05.621]  What is the number one control mechanism that they want to use to stop you from speaking out?
[01:41:05.701 --> 01:41:07.722]  Well, it's intimidation, right?
[01:41:07.782 --> 01:41:08.923]  Intimidation and fear.
[01:41:09.443 --> 01:41:12.705]  So if that doesn't work, they're going to threaten you with legal action.
[01:41:13.105 --> 01:41:16.727]  And if that doesn't work, I mean, they're definitely going to censor you.
[01:41:16.767 --> 01:41:20.429]  We know that that's been happening in the U.S., but what's happening now in the U.K.
[01:41:20.509 --> 01:41:26.132]  is you're actually seeing people being arrested for things that they are posting.
[01:41:27.052 --> 01:41:28.833]  Or reposting, right?
[01:41:28.933 --> 01:41:32.576]  If you retweet something, you can be arrested in the United Kingdom.
[01:41:32.936 --> 01:41:41.082]  And what's so striking about what public officials in the UK have been saying is that they're absolutely certain you're going to be convicted.
[01:41:41.122 --> 01:41:43.143]  So I don't know what happened to innocent until proven guilty.
[01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:46.025]  They're absolutely certain you're going to get jail time.
[01:41:46.105 --> 01:41:51.889]  So they're predetermining what the judges and, you know, what the courts are going to rule in these cases.
[01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:54.491]  And they're threatening travel bans.
[01:41:55.211 --> 01:41:57.612]  OK, so they're going to restrict your freedom of movement now.
[01:41:58.052 --> 01:42:05.234]  I mean, does this sound like a democratically elected government in in the Western world?
[01:42:05.975 --> 01:42:06.655]  No, it doesn't.
[01:42:06.715 --> 01:42:18.159]  It sounds like something that I would have expected to see in Saddam Hussein's Iraq when I was a reporter for CBS News and I was on the ground in Baghdad during the Saddam regime.
[01:42:18.339 --> 01:42:18.539]  Right.
[01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:24.441]  I mean, are we are we reaching the point where you're going to have a government minder follow you around to do your reporting?
[01:42:25.402 --> 01:42:27.165]  I mean, am I going to be a target?
[01:42:27.185 --> 01:42:28.186]  Am I going on some list?
[01:42:28.386 --> 01:42:29.929]  Wait a minute, I'm probably on a list already.
[01:42:30.389 --> 01:42:34.215]  Actually, I know I'm on a list already because I dared to speak at a Moms4Liberty event, right?
[01:42:34.255 --> 01:42:38.982]  To speak up for the type of pornography that they're putting in our schools.
[01:42:40.544 --> 01:42:59.676]  One of the most disturbing things about this is that they want you to believe that if you listen to any of these people, if you take any of this information, if you share any of this information, if you ask questions about what is happening that is outside of the official government narrative, that you are somehow committing a crime.
[01:43:00.156 --> 01:43:01.597]  And what is that designed to do?
[01:43:01.637 --> 01:43:06.260]  Well, people instinctively pull back when that happens.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.241]  They want to protect themselves.
[01:43:08.581 --> 01:43:09.622]  We know this, right?
[01:43:09.682 --> 01:43:12.043]  It's a natural instinct that we all have.
[01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:14.124]  And so what do we do?
[01:43:14.144 --> 01:43:14.985]  We self-censor.
[01:43:15.605 --> 01:43:16.466]  And isn't that great?
[01:43:16.746 --> 01:43:19.748]  Because you just removed yourself from the information battlefield.
[01:43:20.128 --> 01:43:22.849]  And now they don't have to censor you because you're doing it yourself.
[01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:27.132]  And as a journalist, I can tell you, so I've been a journalist for more than 35 years.
[01:43:29.253 --> 01:43:38.136]  And I spent around 16 years as a correspondent for 60 Minutes and the chief foreign correspondent for CBS News, chief foreign affairs correspondent.
[01:43:38.556 --> 01:43:42.398]  And what did I, what did I see around me at that time?
[01:43:42.638 --> 01:43:49.680]  It wasn't so much that there was, you know, a little guy sitting there, Dr. Evil, telling you do this and don't do that.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.282]  It was that people stayed away from stories that were going to cost them their credibility or their career.
[01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:57.703]  It just wasn't worth it.
[01:43:58.263 --> 01:43:58.963]  Why would you bother?
[01:43:59.604 --> 01:43:59.784]  Right?
[01:43:59.824 --> 01:44:01.544]  There's so many stories to tell out there.
[01:44:01.864 --> 01:44:02.785]  So many things happening.
[01:44:03.085 --> 01:44:03.885]  Why would you bother?
[01:44:04.285 --> 01:44:13.189]  Unfortunately, what has happened since then is we've moved from that into a time where there is very clearly
[01:44:13.689 --> 01:44:14.770]  We're good to go.
[01:44:30.043 --> 01:44:32.364]  If you don't fall in line, right?
[01:44:32.645 --> 01:44:37.747]  So what is that effectively do to our children and to young people?
[01:44:38.128 --> 01:44:42.290]  Because today what we're talking about the thing, I mean, you know, I'm old.
[01:44:42.730 --> 01:44:43.531]  I'm getting on there.
[01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:44.831]  I'm 53 years old.
[01:44:45.252 --> 01:44:47.393]  Okay, I'm in the second half of my life.
[01:44:47.693 --> 01:44:49.254]  So I don't really matter anymore.
[01:44:49.574 --> 01:44:50.695]  I've been all over the world.
[01:44:50.755 --> 01:44:52.376]  I've done, you know, incredible things.
[01:44:52.796 --> 01:44:58.159]  I've met everyone from royalty, you know, to famous people in every
[01:44:58.719 --> 01:44:59.939]  Discipline that you can imagine.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:01.800]  Okay, so what do I matter?
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:02.500]  I don't care.
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:03.921]  But I don't matter.
[01:45:04.481 --> 01:45:05.641]  My children matter.
[01:45:05.861 --> 01:45:06.961]  And your children matter.
[01:45:07.342 --> 01:45:10.743]  And now we're being demonized for caring about our children.
[01:45:10.983 --> 01:45:18.585]  We're told you gotta care about people coming across the border, but don't pay attention to all those unaccompanied minors that are unaccounted for.
[01:45:19.145 --> 01:45:31.788]  You know, or we know that from whistleblowers working for the federal government that they've documented two, three, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred kids going to the same address in Houston, Texas, for example.
[01:45:32.148 --> 01:45:33.809]  One of many places where this is happening.
[01:45:33.849 --> 01:45:34.909]  Don't pay attention to that.
[01:45:35.369 --> 01:45:37.350]  Just pay attention to me.
[01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.990]  Right?
[01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:39.370]  Just stick to the narrative.
[01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.251]  And if you don't, we're going to punish you.
[01:45:41.651 --> 01:45:43.291]  So what is our message to our kids?
[01:45:43.751 --> 01:45:45.972]  Well, if you want to get into college,
[01:45:47.128 --> 01:45:48.609]  Don't tell people what you really think.
[01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:56.594]  Don't tell anyone you voted, you know, if you could vote you'd vote for Donald Trump, or you don't believe in abortion, or you believe in God.
[01:45:56.695 --> 01:45:57.355]  Don't say that.
[01:45:57.735 --> 01:45:58.876]  Don't admit that, right?
[01:45:59.737 --> 01:46:01.338]  Because you're going to be punished for that.
[01:46:01.738 --> 01:46:06.141]  If you're honest, and you stand up for who you are and what you believe in, you will be punished.
[01:46:06.181 --> 01:46:07.242]  You will not be rewarded.
[01:46:07.842 --> 01:46:14.148]  And so we tell them to hide, and we tell them to lie to themselves, and we tell them to lie to the people around them.
[01:46:14.248 --> 01:46:15.649]  That's effectively what they're doing.
[01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:18.892]  They gotta do it all through college, and then they gotta do it to get a job.
[01:46:19.353 --> 01:46:19.953]  Well, you know what?
[01:46:20.354 --> 01:46:23.637]  That's not what Alex Jones and InfoWars stands for.
[01:46:24.017 --> 01:46:25.298]  That's not what I stand for.
[01:46:26.059 --> 01:46:31.704]  I stand for freedom, for press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of religion.
[01:46:31.944 --> 01:46:40.852]  I stand for everything that is represented in the Constitution of the United States and for the Constitutional Republic that we live in today.
[01:46:41.473 --> 01:46:44.115]  And I don't care if they come for me.
[01:46:44.416 --> 01:46:46.517]  I think Alex has demonstrated he doesn't care either.
[01:46:47.018 --> 01:46:48.860]  And thank goodness we're not the only ones, right?
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:52.022]  We're not the only ones at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:52.042 --> 01:46:55.425]  You saw that young man in Great Britain and there are many others.
[01:46:55.465 --> 01:46:57.106]  Tucker Carlson is one of them.
[01:46:57.226 --> 01:46:57.727]  Extraordinary.
[01:46:57.987 --> 01:47:00.689]  Hey, one of them is coming up right here at InfoWars.
[01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:01.650]  That's Chad Geyser.
[01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:02.951]  He doesn't care either.
[01:47:02.971 --> 01:47:04.312]  It doesn't matter how much you target him.
[01:47:04.692 --> 01:47:05.713]  He's not going to be quiet.
[01:47:06.053 --> 01:47:08.836]  And so I just want to say this has been a lot of fun for me.
[01:47:08.876 --> 01:47:09.856]  I don't normally do this.
[01:47:09.876 --> 01:47:13.860]  You know, I kind of like to be the long form investigative storyteller.
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.181]  That's, you know, I'm just a journalist.
[01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:16.942]  That's all I am.
[01:47:17.402 --> 01:47:17.623]  But
[01:47:18.443 --> 01:47:21.166]  Um, but I kind of like being Alex Jones just for a moment.
[01:47:21.627 --> 01:47:24.390]  Just for, you know, for a few hours on one day.
[01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:28.475]  And I hope that it's been, um, it's been entertaining and interesting.
[01:47:28.535 --> 01:47:32.800]  I hope you learned something, because that's kind of, you know, that's kind of the part of the job we're supposed to do.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:41.563]  And I would ask you to join me in welcoming to the show, after the break, is going to be Chad Geyser, taking over the mantle.
[01:47:41.883 --> 01:47:43.124]  I have a lot of respect for him.
[01:47:43.144 --> 01:47:45.745]  I have known him for a number of years as well.
[01:47:46.045 --> 01:47:48.506]  And I'm pretty sure he's going to do a better job than I have.
[01:47:48.946 --> 01:47:51.967]  So I just want to say thank you so much for joining us.
[01:47:51.987 --> 01:47:52.507]  Don't worry.
[01:47:52.547 --> 01:47:53.128]  Don't panic.
[01:47:53.648 --> 01:47:54.888]  This is not a permanent change.
[01:47:55.028 --> 01:47:55.969]  Alex is going to be back.
[01:47:56.309 --> 01:48:01.831]  And I know he's doing some special reports this weekend because that man is a machine.
[01:48:01.891 --> 01:48:03.051]  Boy, you can't stop him.
[01:48:03.431 --> 01:48:04.912]  So thank you so much for joining us.
[01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:10.494]  I'm Laura Logan filling in for Alex Jones on this Friday, the 9th of August, 2024.
[01:48:11.954 --> 01:48:19.400]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:48:20.021 --> 01:48:22.303]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:48:22.903 --> 01:48:29.429]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:48:29.449 --> 01:48:33.012]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:48:33.492 --> 01:48:39.657]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:48:40.538 --> 01:48:49.222]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:58.505]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:48:58.905 --> 01:49:00.026]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:01.126]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:49:01.526 --> 01:49:02.447]  It is very, very popular.
[01:49:03.047 --> 01:49:04.788]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:49:04.988 --> 01:49:11.891]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:49:12.331 --> 01:49:16.373]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:49:16.593 --> 01:49:20.675]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:49:21.195 --> 01:49:28.919]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the courts said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:49:30.019 --> 01:49:30.840]  And they kicked him back.
[01:49:31.989 --> 01:49:35.712]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:49:36.012 --> 01:49:47.081]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:56.089]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:49:56.589 --> 01:50:06.818]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram in an affordable, sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[01:50:07.219 --> 01:50:08.720]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:10.882]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:10.962 --> 01:50:11.563]  It's got the little
[01:50:12.183 --> 01:50:16.509]  Bar of gold in there, and it just lets you know that you supported the Infowar.
[01:50:16.809 --> 01:50:28.744]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:29.105 --> 01:50:30.406]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:50:31.047 --> 01:50:33.948]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:50:34.509 --> 01:50:37.510]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:42.732]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:50:43.092 --> 01:50:45.213]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:50:45.994 --> 01:50:51.956]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:50:51.976 --> 01:50:52.617]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:50:53.177 --> 01:50:55.358]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:50:55.378 --> 01:50:56.158]  That's not what this is.
[01:50:56.178 --> 01:50:57.219]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:50:57.819 --> 01:51:10.911]  This is like, on NPR, that still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:51:11.191 --> 01:51:12.132]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:51:12.852 --> 01:51:17.657]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[01:51:20.179 --> 01:51:23.203]  $80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:26.407]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:51:26.907 --> 01:51:34.617]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:51:34.977 --> 01:51:36.079]  The decision is yours.
[01:51:36.519 --> 01:51:37.501]  This is a limited edition.
[01:51:38.141 --> 01:51:42.463]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:51:43.143 --> 01:51:53.466]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:51:53.807 --> 01:52:02.710]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:03.950]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:05.971]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:52:12.105 --> 01:52:14.786]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:52:14.927 --> 01:52:15.747]  How did this happen?
[01:52:16.407 --> 01:52:17.128]  Who's to blame?
[01:52:18.168 --> 01:52:22.731]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable.
[01:52:22.751 --> 01:52:28.494]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:52:29.754 --> 01:52:31.115]  I know why you did it.
[01:52:31.735 --> 01:52:32.795]  I know you were afraid.
[01:52:32.815 --> 01:52:33.996]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:52:34.516 --> 01:52:35.076]  War?
[01:52:35.236 --> 01:52:35.776]  Terror?
[01:52:35.876 --> 01:52:36.537]  Disease?
[01:52:37.177 --> 01:52:43.039]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rock you of your common sense.
[01:52:43.599 --> 01:52:51.922]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:52:52.442 --> 01:52:54.463]  But if you see what I see,
[01:52:55.263 --> 01:53:05.446]  If you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgotten.
[01:53:05.646 --> 01:53:11.588]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:53:11.908 --> 01:53:18.150]  If I were the devil, if I were the prince of deception, I'd want to shroud the world in unyielding darkness.
[01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:26.795]  I'd seize control over the lands and masses, but I wouldn't be satisfied until I had quashed the boldest voice of truth, InfoWars.
[01:53:27.116 --> 01:53:29.737]  So I'd work meticulously to control the world.
[01:53:30.218 --> 01:53:32.879]  I'd target platforms like InfoWars first.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.081]  I'd initiate a campaign of silence.
[01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.842]  With the subtlety of a serpent,
[01:53:37.502 --> 01:53:42.585]  I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve, believe only what you're told.
[01:53:42.925 --> 01:53:47.847]  To the young I would whisper, InfoWars is a fake news conspiracy theory network.
[01:53:48.168 --> 01:53:54.711]  I would convince them that man needs no alternate perspectives, no dissenting voices, no questions against the status quo.
[01:53:55.151 --> 01:54:05.075]  I would assure them that InfoWars is false, and what's approved is true, and the old I would teach to say after me, our father which art in censorship.
[01:54:05.375 --> 01:54:16.799]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have people at war with InfoWars, platforms at war with free speech, and nations at war with freedom of thought, until each in its turn was uniform.
[01:54:17.259 --> 01:54:28.752]  If I were the devil, I would undermine platforms like InfoWars from being a refuge for the Inquisitive until before you knew it, you'd have suppression and censorship at every door.
[01:54:29.153 --> 01:54:31.756]  Soon, I'd have unity and misinformation.
[01:54:32.256 --> 01:54:35.159]  I'd have influential figures promoting a single narrative.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:42.627]  Soon, I could evict info wars from social media, then from search engines, and then from the homes of patriots.
[01:54:43.028 --> 01:54:48.534]  I would lure society into believing only one perspective, dismissing info wars as falsehood.
[01:54:48.854 --> 01:54:52.738]  And what do you bet I could get whole states to promote uniformity as progress?
[01:54:53.639 --> 01:55:03.107]  I would convince the young that independent platforms are outdated, that compliance is more comfortable, that what you see in the mainstream media is the only perspective.
[01:55:03.427 --> 01:55:10.993]  In other words, if I were the devil, I wouldn't want you to visit InfoWars.com forward slash show today.
[01:55:11.755 --> 01:55:12.935]  We don't make this stuff up.
[01:55:13.155 --> 01:55:14.295]  Believe me, I wish we were.
[01:55:14.516 --> 01:55:15.176]  Believe me.
[01:55:15.376 --> 01:55:16.216]  Believe me!
[01:55:16.456 --> 01:55:17.056]  Believe it!
[01:55:17.096 --> 01:55:22.937]  But when I get this info, I'm gonna tell you, no matter what happens, you can be guaranteed of that!
[01:55:23.697 --> 01:55:27.578]  No matter what happens, I will go 100%, period!
[01:55:27.718 --> 01:55:28.418]  And that's it!
[01:55:28.798 --> 01:55:29.278]  Excuse me.
[01:55:29.298 --> 01:55:32.899]  The reason I started yelling, folks, is this is life and death stuff, okay?
[01:55:33.439 --> 01:55:38.800]  And my adrenaline just goes crazy, because at a subconscious level, I realize this is combat, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.903]  This is, this is, this is not a joke, this is not a game.
[01:55:42.923 --> 01:55:44.244]  It's not good to serve evil.
[01:55:45.045 --> 01:55:58.176]  All these globalists look like reanimated corpses, and they all just get off on destruction and power, and their empire's collapsing, sucking America down with it, and they're not gonna let it collapse without starting World War III!
[01:55:58.376 --> 01:55:59.517]  That's what all this is about!
[01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:06.558]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:56:07.058 --> 01:56:11.604]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:56:11.845 --> 01:56:14.228]  And now, the man who won't be silenced.
[01:56:14.668 --> 01:56:16.550]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:56:17.705 --> 01:56:21.566]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next two hours.
[01:56:21.586 --> 01:56:27.828]  We've got outstanding news to cover, amazing clips to share, and we have an outstanding guest as well.
[01:56:27.888 --> 01:56:34.571]  Kirk Elliott is going to be joining us in about 30 minutes, for 30 minutes, so make sure you stay tuned and make sure you visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:38.472]  A miracle happened here at InfoWars and we got bodies back in stock.
[01:56:38.592 --> 01:56:46.034]  We never thought we were going to be able to order inventory again, but today bodies is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:46.054 --> 01:56:55.057]  This could be the last opportunity you have to get it because it's always a prayer as to whether or not we're going to get some of our flagship products back in stock again.
[01:56:55.457 --> 01:57:00.458]  So please go to InfoWarsStore.com right now, get bodies and be the reason we are still on the air.
[01:57:00.499 --> 01:57:01.859]  Stay tuned for more on the other side.
[01:57:02.319 --> 01:57:05.601]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next two hours.
[01:57:05.901 --> 01:57:12.044]  Alex Jones will be back in studio perhaps later today, but on the air for sure tomorrow and Sunday.
[01:57:12.605 --> 01:57:21.370]  He is loaded for bear and ready to awaken all patriots with a semblance of America in their hearts so that we can take back this country on November 5th.
[01:57:22.512 --> 01:57:26.035]  Now we've seen this campaign really ramp up over the course of the last several days.
[01:57:26.075 --> 01:57:27.676]  This week has been a wild ride.
[01:57:28.677 --> 01:57:33.641]  And we are in the midst of the honeymoon phase for Kamala Harris.
[01:57:33.741 --> 01:57:40.626]  She made the decision to choose Tim Walz as her running mate instead of Josh Shapiro.
[01:57:41.767 --> 01:57:43.548]  And both of these candidates were really bad.
[01:57:43.728 --> 01:57:45.089]  They were terrible options.
[01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:49.072]  But she seems to have chosen the less formidable opponent.
[01:57:50.063 --> 01:57:52.545]  For the Trump ticket in Walton.
[01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:53.766]  We're going to get into some of these reasons.
[01:57:53.826 --> 01:57:57.509]  Obviously this stolen Valor thing is a major factor.
[01:57:57.529 --> 01:58:03.594]  We have clips going all the way back to 2009 complaining about his stolen Valor claims.
[01:58:05.194 --> 01:58:07.895]  And this has been a problem for him his entire career.
[01:58:08.396 --> 01:58:15.119]  So it's not really a surprise that we see from the left this disingenuous behavior.
[01:58:15.179 --> 01:58:19.541]  We know that Kamala has been misleading the public as to her racial background.
[01:58:19.601 --> 01:58:25.364]  She's traveling all over the country and changing her accent depending on which audience she's speaking to.
[01:58:25.404 --> 01:58:32.008]  We have clips of her acting like she's from the hood when she speaks to a certain socioeconomic demographic.
[01:58:33.161 --> 01:58:49.351]  And we have clips of her acting completely differently in front of other audiences while we have Tim Waltz going around and saying that he believes that fourth graders who are suffering from gender dysphoria should be totally given the care of the state in terms of facilitating their transition.
[01:58:50.171 --> 01:58:54.034]  All while he claims that he used weapons of war in war.
[01:58:54.634 --> 01:59:00.519]  This all in the context of the DOJ really ramping up its case against Hunter Biden.
[01:59:00.559 --> 01:59:02.580]  So the Biden thing is falling apart.
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.402]  Kamala is making a fool of herself.
[01:59:04.842 --> 01:59:08.244]  She's got to have celebrities perform at her rallies in order for anyone to attend.
[01:59:08.284 --> 01:59:14.429]  And then she brags about the audience size post facto, even though the audience is not there to see her whatsoever.
[01:59:14.869 --> 01:59:18.252]  And then Tim Walz is bumbling around like a fool.
[01:59:19.690 --> 01:59:25.754]  Basically ignoring any questions or evidence of his stolen valor claims.
[01:59:26.494 --> 01:59:27.615]  And the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:59:27.655 --> 01:59:28.695]  This is not speculation.
[01:59:28.935 --> 01:59:29.996]  This is not a cheap shot.
[01:59:30.036 --> 01:59:35.179]  This is not something that's just said about an opponent that's not really true that you let ride.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.582]  This man claimed that he fought in war using weapons of war when he never did.
[01:59:41.563 --> 01:59:44.705]  And now he's running to be the Vice President of the United States.
[01:59:45.505 --> 01:59:46.546]  But my concern is
[01:59:48.556 --> 01:59:53.823]  The disparity between the activity I see among the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign.
[01:59:54.323 --> 01:59:55.685]  Obviously, I'm voting for Donald Trump.
[01:59:55.785 --> 02:00:00.611]  Obviously, this has been one of the most inspirational election seasons in the history of the United States.
[02:00:00.651 --> 02:00:06.719]  What with Trump taking a bullet for our republic, surviving, standing up and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[02:00:08.425 --> 02:00:12.650]  And Trump's outstanding performance in the debate on June 27th, which annihilated Joe Biden.
[02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:24.004]  I mean, if he wins, if Trump wins on November 5th, I think he'll be the first president in the history of the United States who successfully beat two candidates from the opposing party in the same race.
[02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.770]  We're good to go.
[02:00:55.225 --> 02:00:55.845]  I'm Nancy Pelosi.
[02:00:55.865 --> 02:01:05.612]  This is clip number 31 and it reminds me of this clip that came out a couple of weeks ago where she admitted that she took full responsibility for the failure that was January 6th.
[02:01:06.132 --> 02:01:11.036]  She owned up to the fact that she failed and did not have enough security at that event.
[02:01:11.596 --> 02:01:27.369]  Now she seems to be committing the same error where on video she's basically admitting that she was responsible for yet another coup, another false flag, another operation that totally undermines the integrity of any democratic process in our elections here in the United States.
[02:01:27.389 --> 02:01:28.330]  This is clip number 31.
[02:01:30.450 --> 02:01:35.353]  I love him so much, I think he's been really a fantastic President of the United States.
[02:01:36.073 --> 02:01:41.256]  So I really wanted him to make a decision of a better campaign.
[02:01:42.497 --> 02:01:45.039]  Because they were not facing the fact of what was happening.
[02:01:45.299 --> 02:01:50.082]  Just a little background, I've never been that impressed with his political operation.
[02:01:50.882 --> 02:01:51.643]  Biden's operation.
[02:01:51.663 --> 02:01:52.263]  Yeah, I'm not.
[02:01:52.443 --> 02:01:54.044]  I mean, I just haven't been.
[02:01:54.264 --> 02:01:56.245]  They won the White House, bravo.
[02:01:59.511 --> 02:02:03.655]  So my concern was, this ain't happening.
[02:02:04.956 --> 02:02:08.479]  And we have to make a decision for this to happen.
[02:02:08.759 --> 02:02:11.841]  And the president has to make the decision for that to happen.
[02:02:12.162 --> 02:02:16.706]  Let me just say, I won't say necessarily I knew what I was doing at that time.
[02:02:17.246 --> 02:02:22.090]  I knew what I was doing in the whole thing, not just that show.
[02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:22.691]  And what was that?
[02:02:23.735 --> 02:02:27.656]  That Donald Trump would never set foot in the White House again.
[02:02:28.236 --> 02:02:28.717]  There you go.
[02:02:28.817 --> 02:02:34.018]  So all principles, all values can go out the window if it means defeating Donald Trump.
[02:02:34.058 --> 02:02:47.722]  And what's really interesting about those comments right there is not only does it show that she's willing to totally undermine the integrity of all of our elections in order to ensure that Donald Trump never has power in the White House again, but it also implies to me that she would be willing to even take his life.
[02:02:48.703 --> 02:02:53.044]  And it seems like the rest of the world has totally forgotten
[02:02:55.222 --> 02:02:59.608]  That there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump just weeks ago.
[02:03:00.449 --> 02:03:04.635]  It seems like they've totally forgotten, despite the fact that there's new footage every week.
[02:03:05.498 --> 02:03:08.800]  New witnesses every week, new testimonies every week.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:15.824]  Despite the fact that it keeps coming up, everyone seems to have forgotten the fact that there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.
[02:03:15.844 --> 02:03:28.192]  And I'm not just trying to remind everyone over and over again until November 5th of how brave he was and how inspirational it was, but I'm trying to emphasize how obvious it is that this was a deep state operation to take Donald Trump's life.
[02:03:28.712 --> 02:03:30.112]  I think it was Joe Biden's Hail Mary.
[02:03:30.132 --> 02:03:33.614]  I think he thought, all right, they won't try to push me out as the candidate.
[02:03:33.774 --> 02:03:38.295]  They won't try to 25th amendment me as the candidate if Donald Trump dies.
[02:03:38.355 --> 02:03:40.996]  If he died, then I wouldn't have to quit being the president.
[02:03:41.336 --> 02:03:45.858]  Then I wouldn't have to withdraw from this race because victory would then be ensured.
[02:03:45.878 --> 02:03:53.040]  And I think that he behaved like a Clinton or an Obama and he just saw to it that this assassination attempt was going to happen.
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:54.120]  I think the deep state was behind it.
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:56.181]  I think the leftist regime was behind it.
[02:03:57.395 --> 02:04:10.018]  And yes, maybe it is the case that this shooter was a lone wolf, but lone wolves are the status quo for the deep state in terms of actually seeing to it that a political opponent is assassinated or killed.
[02:04:10.999 --> 02:04:18.501]  So it seems to me that this person was used by the political class to assassinate Donald Trump.
[02:04:19.463 --> 02:04:21.285]  And everybody is forgetting about it.
[02:04:21.305 --> 02:04:30.534]  I mean, I'm even hearing rumors that the Waltz campaign and staffers are joking about it and bragging about how this is like a forgotten issue.
[02:04:31.094 --> 02:04:37.520]  And I'm concerned that by the time November 5th comes around, people are going to forget that Donald Trump is the leading candidate.
[02:04:38.301 --> 02:04:40.903]  And for that reason, there was an attempt on his life.
[02:04:41.997 --> 02:04:48.402]  I mean, it's like a no brainer that if there's an assassination attempt on a candidate who's leading in the polls, that is the hero of the story.
[02:04:48.762 --> 02:04:50.384]  That is the person that you're supposed to vote for.
[02:04:50.404 --> 02:04:54.807]  But we're seeing a lot more activity from the Harris campaign than from the Trump campaign.
[02:04:54.827 --> 02:05:06.076]  And I'm just praying that after this conversation that Donald Trump has with Elon Musk on Monday evening, Donald Trump will return to X and be active because this is, the stakes are so high.
[02:05:07.017 --> 02:05:11.899]  He needs to use all of the tools at his disposal in order to defeat this leftist regime.
[02:05:12.019 --> 02:05:23.204]  And speaking of leftist regime, we have clip after clip after clip just proving how much of a leftist Kamala Harris really is.
[02:05:23.244 --> 02:05:29.367]  How much of a collectivist, Marxist, frankly, communist she really is.
[02:05:30.427 --> 02:05:31.328]  And let's just start
[02:05:32.344 --> 02:05:37.909]  With clip number six here of Kamala talking about fair outcomes in a very hyperbolic way.
[02:05:37.969 --> 02:05:38.430]  Clip six.
[02:05:39.691 --> 02:05:43.454]  Balance and then the outcome will be fair.
[02:05:44.976 --> 02:05:47.919]  And isn't that what we're talking about in this here election?
[02:05:49.926 --> 02:05:52.087]  We're saying we just want fairness.
[02:05:52.147 --> 02:05:54.448]  We want dignity for all people.
[02:05:55.148 --> 02:06:07.594]  We want to recognize the right all people have to freedom and liberty, to make choices, especially those that are about heart and home, and not have their government telling them what to do.
[02:06:12.116 --> 02:06:14.938]  Our campaign is about saying we trust the people.
[02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:18.850]  We see the people, we know the people.
[02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:21.293]  You know one of the things I love about our country?
[02:06:22.253 --> 02:06:33.382]  We are a nation of people who believe in those ideals that were foundational to what made us so special as a nation.
[02:06:34.183 --> 02:06:36.025]  We believe in those ideals.
[02:06:37.287 --> 02:06:41.211]  And the sisters and brothers of labor have always fought for those ideals.
[02:06:42.232 --> 02:06:43.734]  Always fought for those ideals.
[02:06:44.034 --> 02:06:47.077]  And we know we are a work in progress.
[02:06:47.138 --> 02:06:56.788]  We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying because we love our country and we believe in who we are.
[02:07:01.810 --> 02:07:03.711]  And that's what our campaign is about.
[02:07:03.791 --> 02:07:05.472]  We love our country.
[02:07:06.713 --> 02:07:08.854]  We believe in our country.
[02:07:09.034 --> 02:07:10.715]  We believe in each other.
[02:07:11.936 --> 02:07:13.817]  We believe in the collective.
[02:07:14.777 --> 02:07:22.842]  We're not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us, trying to separate us, trying to pull us apart.
[02:07:23.642 --> 02:07:25.964]  That's not where the strength lies.
[02:07:29.005 --> 02:07:29.806]  And there is that.
[02:07:34.173 --> 02:07:49.718]  And so I say to all the members of UAW and Sean Fain as the first who I talked to about this, I am so deeply honored as a lifelong supporter of union labor for Tim and I to have the endorsement of UAW.
[02:07:49.818 --> 02:07:51.439]  Oh my gosh.
[02:07:52.079 --> 02:07:53.340]  She's so deeply honored.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:58.942]  That's like somebody breaking into your house, stealing your TV and saying that they feel honored to have such a nice TV.
[02:08:00.313 --> 02:08:07.995]  She has stolen this election, not a single vote for her from Democratic voters in the primary.
[02:08:09.076 --> 02:08:17.018]  She saw to it that the President of the United States was blackmailed specifically by Nancy Pelosi, who just admitted it on the clip that we showed you.
[02:08:17.881 --> 02:08:27.183]  Blackmailed into withdrawing from the race so that he wouldn't suffer the humiliation of being brought to justice via the 25th Amendment, because he knew he couldn't pass any cognitive tests.
[02:08:27.524 --> 02:08:38.706]  He knew that if there was a 25th Amendment approach and there was an investigation and they really got to the bottom of what was going on, it would become apparent that he was suffering from cognitive decline, dementia, in a very real way, since 2019 at least.
[02:08:40.707 --> 02:08:43.868]  So she has blackmailed her way into this position.
[02:08:44.741 --> 02:08:56.278]  Without a single vote and she claims to love fairness and democracy when everything that she does is absolutely antithetical to both of those principles, those institutions, those notions?
[02:08:58.217 --> 02:09:06.823]  This woman is absolutely insane, and not only is she wretched and evil, but she's totally unlikable in every way.
[02:09:06.883 --> 02:09:20.494]  I mean, Harry Sisson and others were bragging in clip 12 here about how Kamala Harris did such a great job handling this heckler, when she really just came off as a Karen, first of all, in the clip, and what she said didn't even make sense.
[02:09:21.635 --> 02:09:22.055]  Let's watch.
[02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:30.835]  He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis, and he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
[02:09:31.295 --> 02:09:31.876]  You know what?
[02:09:32.396 --> 02:09:36.919]  If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise I'm speaking.
[02:09:40.301 --> 02:09:41.042]  How is that a comeback?
[02:09:43.724 --> 02:09:46.005]  If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that, otherwise I'm speaking.
[02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:49.307]  Well, obviously that person wants Donald Trump to win, whatever he said.
[02:09:50.508 --> 02:09:51.649]  And she's gonna give him the stink eye?
[02:09:56.637 --> 02:09:57.697]  Unbelievable.
[02:09:57.737 --> 02:09:58.597]  She's so tough.
[02:09:59.938 --> 02:10:00.938]  She's dead serious.
[02:10:01.758 --> 02:10:02.978]  Look how stoic she is.
[02:10:13.481 --> 02:10:23.963]  And not only is it obvious that she's abundantly unlikable, and evil, and corrupt, and unworthy, and unqualified, and incompetent, all the things that a president shouldn't be, she manifests.
[02:10:23.983 --> 02:10:25.123]  She embodies herself.
[02:10:26.445 --> 02:10:33.392]  But we have her running mate who is obviously guilty of stolen valor in a number of different ways on a number of different occasions.
[02:10:33.412 --> 02:10:34.654]  We're going to show clip 14 here.
[02:10:34.934 --> 02:10:40.640]  This is Tim Waltz saying that he used weapons of war in war.
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.682]  Just simply brazenly false.
[02:10:42.762 --> 02:10:43.122]  Clip number 14.
[02:10:46.437 --> 02:10:51.259]  Hope woke up like many of you did five weeks ago and said, Dad, you're the only person I know who's in elected office.
[02:10:51.279 --> 02:10:52.940]  You need to stop what's happening with this.
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.760]  I'll take my kick in the butt for the NRA.
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:56.921]  I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt.
[02:10:57.301 --> 02:10:59.702]  And I gave the money back, and I'll tell you what I have been doing.
[02:10:59.722 --> 02:11:04.084]  I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks.
[02:11:04.124 --> 02:11:05.385]  We can do CDC research.
[02:11:05.605 --> 02:11:12.948]  We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons were at.
[02:11:13.448 --> 02:11:15.369]  Now, you know who actually was deployed in the war?
[02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.710]  J.D.
[02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:15.990]  Vance.
[02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:17.291]  We're going to show you in clip 13.
[02:11:17.631 --> 02:11:18.372]  This is J.D.
[02:11:18.432 --> 02:11:32.061]  Vance responding to Tim Walz's stolen valor, his lies about service, his obvious dodging of service, leaving the military right before it was going to be deployed.
[02:11:32.081 --> 02:11:34.603]  His unit was going to be deployed into the war.
[02:11:34.743 --> 02:11:35.304]  So clip number 13 here.
[02:11:36.527 --> 02:11:41.928]  When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.
[02:11:42.268 --> 02:11:45.609]  I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service.
[02:11:46.029 --> 02:11:49.109]  When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?
[02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:57.471]  He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.
[02:11:57.811 --> 02:11:58.831]  I think it's shameful.
[02:11:59.852 --> 02:12:01.292]  So, not only
[02:12:02.891 --> 02:12:09.296]  Is the left just completely denying the fact that Tim Walz never served in combat in any way, shape or form.
[02:12:09.757 --> 02:12:12.359]  And he is guilty of stolen valor here.
[02:12:12.379 --> 02:12:15.121]  I mean, there's images of him wearing hats with the Green Beret symbol and stuff.
[02:12:15.141 --> 02:12:16.582]  He was never a Green Beret.
[02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:22.547]  But so many of these surrogates and people that are associated with the campaign seem to have no idea that J.D.
[02:12:22.607 --> 02:12:24.368]  Vance was actually in the military.
[02:12:24.408 --> 02:12:24.909]  This is clip number 15.
[02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:32.214]  Well, here is Tim Walz, who enlisted when he was 17 years old.
[02:12:32.294 --> 02:12:35.577]  He served in the National Guard for 24 years.
[02:12:36.077 --> 02:12:38.259]  And I'm not aware of any military service that J.D.
[02:12:38.359 --> 02:12:40.841]  Vance has ever served.
[02:12:41.041 --> 02:12:43.002]  So let's just make the comparison there.
[02:12:43.603 --> 02:12:48.947]  And what happened in the tragedy of the killing of George Floyd and then the unrest?
[02:12:49.768 --> 02:12:51.509]  Yeah, so she's going on CNN.
[02:12:51.609 --> 02:12:52.530]  She has no idea.
[02:12:53.692 --> 02:12:54.333]  I don't think so.
[02:13:16.943 --> 02:13:21.868]  I mean, frankly, Donald Trump has seen more combat than Tim Waltz.
[02:13:22.569 --> 02:13:24.831]  I mean, Donald Trump actually got shot for this country.
[02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:26.953]  Tim Waltz never went into a combat zone for it.
[02:13:27.213 --> 02:13:28.755]  That's the real disparity here.
[02:13:29.255 --> 02:13:33.179]  And we have example after example of how disingenuous these people are.
[02:13:33.199 --> 02:13:37.684]  I mean, in clip 20 here, just look at this promo.
[02:13:37.704 --> 02:13:40.426]  It's exactly like the promo video that was made
[02:13:41.286 --> 02:13:42.107]  We're good to go.
[02:13:56.132 --> 02:13:57.953]  Obviously, it was staged for the promo.
[02:13:58.354 --> 02:14:05.218]  Same thing happening here when Harris calls Waltz to say that she would like him to be the vice presidential candidate on the ticket.
[02:14:05.698 --> 02:14:06.499]  It's this staged thing.
[02:14:06.539 --> 02:14:11.362]  There's film crews on both sides of the phone call, and they're acting like they're having this conversation for the first time.
[02:14:11.382 --> 02:14:12.743]  These people are so full of shit.
[02:14:12.783 --> 02:14:13.563]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:13.583 --> 02:14:14.144]  Let's run the clip.
[02:14:16.125 --> 02:14:19.307]  Hi, this is Tim.
[02:14:20.268 --> 02:14:21.248]  It's Kamala Harris.
[02:14:21.409 --> 02:14:22.429]  Good morning, Governor.
[02:14:23.130 --> 02:14:24.931]  Good morning, Madam Vice President.
[02:14:25.563 --> 02:14:28.165]  Listen, I want you to do this with me.
[02:14:28.365 --> 02:14:29.886]  Let's do this together.
[02:14:29.926 --> 02:14:33.069]  Would you be my running mate and let's get this thing on the road?
[02:14:33.089 --> 02:14:36.911]  I would be honored, Madam Vice President.
[02:14:37.132 --> 02:14:44.157]  The joy that you're bringing back to the country, the enthusiasm that's out there, it would be a privilege to take this with you across the country.
[02:14:44.724 --> 02:14:47.746]  Well, let me tell you, I have just the utmost respect for you.
[02:14:47.766 --> 02:14:50.628]  I have really enjoyed our work together.
[02:14:50.788 --> 02:14:52.730]  You understand our country.
[02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:58.033]  You have dedicated yourself to our country in so many different and beautiful ways.
[02:14:58.213 --> 02:14:59.154]  And we're going to do this.
[02:14:59.214 --> 02:14:59.915]  We're going to win.
[02:15:00.795 --> 02:15:06.539]  And we're going to unify our country and remind everyone that we are fighting for the future for everyone.
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.721]  So let's get out there and get this done, OK?
[02:15:09.798 --> 02:15:10.319]  Let's do it.
[02:15:10.359 --> 02:15:11.280]  Do the work in front of us.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:12.181]  Let's win this thing.
[02:15:12.321 --> 02:15:12.902]  That's right.
[02:15:13.082 --> 02:15:13.523]  All right, buddy.
[02:15:13.543 --> 02:15:14.283]  I'll see you soon.
[02:15:14.364 --> 02:15:14.884]  Take care.
[02:15:15.084 --> 02:15:15.645]  Thank you.
[02:15:15.885 --> 02:15:16.086]  Okay.
[02:15:26.638 --> 02:15:29.199]  For helping the victims of sexual assault.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:30.720]  This is clip number 22 here.
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:40.166]  This is just another example of Democrats exploiting the suffering and ails of other people for the sake of their own political gain without any conscience whatsoever.
[02:15:40.526 --> 02:15:47.850]  Just using it as a story to tell to garner emotional support and get votes based off of lie after lie after lie.
[02:15:49.151 --> 02:15:54.554]  So Mika, when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather.
[02:15:56.661 --> 02:16:03.244]  And when I learned about it, I said to her, you're going to have to come live with us.
[02:16:03.284 --> 02:16:04.004]  I called my mother.
[02:16:04.224 --> 02:16:05.845]  My mother said, of course, she has to come stay with us.
[02:16:05.925 --> 02:16:06.345]  And she did.
[02:16:08.126 --> 02:16:14.369]  And so at a young age, I decided I wanted to do the work that was about protecting women and children.
[02:16:15.209 --> 02:16:20.432]  And I became a prosecutor and I specialized in, in particular, child sexual assault.
[02:16:22.618 --> 02:16:34.671]  And the fact that after the Dobbs decision came down, that laws have been proposed and passed, that as Hadley has said, make no exceptions even for rape or incest.
[02:16:35.728 --> 02:16:52.834]  Think about what these extremists are saying to a survivor of a crime of violence to their body, a survivor of a crime that is a violation of their body, and to say to that survivor, and you have no right or authority to make
[02:16:53.234 --> 02:17:07.758]  The audacity to come out and claim that she loves survivors of sexual assault and she supports them and fights for them, given the fact that she was the Vice President of the United States under Joe Biden, who is documented in his own daughter's diary as being a molester.
[02:17:08.098 --> 02:17:12.959]  Clip after clip after clip of him smelling hair and pinching the nipples of underage girls.
[02:17:13.019 --> 02:17:13.979]  It's all documented.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:15.720]  Even these victims have admitted it.
[02:17:16.738 --> 02:17:21.841]  He's actually been accused, credibly, of sexual assault at least once.
[02:17:21.861 --> 02:17:25.564]  If you count his daughter's stuff, multiple times.
[02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:27.685]  And she worked for him.
[02:17:27.966 --> 02:17:28.826]  She totally sold out.
[02:17:28.986 --> 02:17:32.609]  And remember, she was actually the border czar.
[02:17:33.877 --> 02:17:40.922]  You want to talk to me about caring about rape and incest when you've opened up our southern border and refused to do anything about it?
[02:17:40.942 --> 02:17:49.228]  Frankly, you've sponsored the invasion of the United States by the worst people all over the world through our southern border to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.
[02:17:49.789 --> 02:17:51.190]  Excuse me, tens of millions of people.
[02:17:52.614 --> 02:17:57.156]  Hundreds of thousands of them from countries of interest committing rapes and murders.
[02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:13.423]  So don't talk to me about how you feel for the victims of rape and incest when they can't get an abortion, when you have literally sponsored the rape of thousands of people in the United States because of your leftist, collectivist policies.
[02:18:14.163 --> 02:18:15.603]  Give me a break.
[02:18:15.643 --> 02:18:18.144]  And let's just see how genuine she is here in clip number 23.
[02:18:19.545 --> 02:18:26.228]  Let's just see how personal she is with her constituents and her voters that she's trying to garner the support of.
[02:18:26.248 --> 02:18:28.909]  So good to be back in Michigan.
[02:18:28.929 --> 02:18:34.091]  Listen, let me tell you, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state.
[02:18:34.251 --> 02:18:39.734]  And listen, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state.
[02:18:40.134 --> 02:18:41.715]  I took on perpetrators.
[02:18:42.768 --> 02:18:43.509]  Of all kinds.
[02:18:44.029 --> 02:18:46.271]  I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
[02:18:46.592 --> 02:18:48.554]  And had a summer job at McDonald's.
[02:18:49.855 --> 02:18:51.877]  I had a summer job at McDonald's.
[02:18:52.518 --> 02:18:53.859]  So hear me when I say.
[02:18:54.239 --> 02:18:56.381]  So hear me Detroit when I say.
[02:18:56.401 --> 02:18:58.844]  I know Donald Trump's tight.
[02:19:00.302 --> 02:19:02.265]  I know Donald Trump's type.
[02:19:03.025 --> 02:19:05.829]  And are we ready to fight for it?
[02:19:05.849 --> 02:19:10.695]  And are we ready to fight for it?
[02:19:12.236 --> 02:19:13.338]  And when we fight,
[02:19:15.883 --> 02:19:18.305]  Oh, it's so Focus Group canned.
[02:19:18.445 --> 02:19:20.446]  It's just garbage, garbage, garbage.
[02:19:20.606 --> 02:19:21.687]  Folks, we're coming up on a break.
[02:19:21.927 --> 02:19:26.650]  We've got the wonderful, talented Dr. Kirk Elliott joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:29.832]  Make sure you stay tuned and make sure you go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:30.192 --> 02:19:35.215]  After I speak to Kirk for the next 30 minutes, we're going to get right back into some of these Kamala Clips because there's just so many.
[02:19:35.576 --> 02:19:38.137]  We have to get to the bottom of this if we're going to make the right decision in November.
[02:19:38.478 --> 02:19:39.058]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:19:39.358 --> 02:19:41.438]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[02:19:41.639 --> 02:19:46.200]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:49.240]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:50.781]  That's our only incentive.
[02:19:50.921 --> 02:19:53.421]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[02:19:53.961 --> 02:20:01.923]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[02:20:01.943 --> 02:20:05.784]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[02:20:06.904 --> 02:20:07.525]  We're good to go.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:31.442]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:31.482 --> 02:20:33.524]  We are joined by the esteemed Kirk Elliott.
[02:20:33.544 --> 02:20:35.446]  I'm always pleased to speak with you, Kirk.
[02:20:35.947 --> 02:20:36.928]  What is on your mind?
[02:20:51.229 --> 02:20:56.013]  Well, what's on everybody's mind, actually, and that's all this talk about recession, right?
[02:20:56.033 --> 02:21:02.458]  It's like, so normally when you talk about a recession, you think of the Great Depression, right?
[02:21:02.478 --> 02:21:06.861]  It's like, oh, there was food lines, dust bowl, and nobody could afford anything.
[02:21:06.941 --> 02:21:07.902]  This is different.
[02:21:08.523 --> 02:21:09.744]  What we're seeing this time
[02:21:10.624 --> 02:21:30.311]  is let's define terms a little bit so recession is a slowdown in in business right mom and pop stores aren't selling anything corporate america is not selling anything because people don't have jobs or they can't afford things right so so that's where we've got this slowdown of the economy but what we have this time
[02:21:30.931 --> 02:21:35.753]  That we didn't have during the Great Depression is massive amounts of inflation.
[02:21:36.313 --> 02:21:39.574]  So this is called stagflation, right?
[02:21:39.594 --> 02:21:45.076]  It's like stagnant economy plus inflation, and that's the worst of all possible scenarios.
[02:21:45.116 --> 02:21:49.057]  That's what we had in the late 70s during the Carter years.
[02:21:50.357 --> 02:22:02.701]  Which is rising prices with inflation going up, they're printing money like there's no tomorrow, higher taxes so people can't afford the higher prices, wages coming down and unemployment skyrocketing, right?
[02:22:02.721 --> 02:22:09.103]  It's like, man, for a policymaker, that is the worst possible scenario to get out of ever.
[02:22:09.123 --> 02:22:11.224]  It's like almost impossible.
[02:22:11.424 --> 02:22:17.666]  So when we look back at how did Reagan get out of this when he became president in 1980,
[02:22:19.088 --> 02:22:24.669]  Well, inflation at the time was 14.3 percent.
[02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:31.731]  Well, all of the viewers out there who are old enough to remember, I mean, I can remember I was in, like, junior high at the time, right?
[02:22:31.791 --> 02:22:34.972]  But interest rates went to 18 percent.
[02:22:34.992 --> 02:22:39.433]  If you had a 30-year mortgage back then, it was 18 percent.
[02:22:39.713 --> 02:22:42.234]  So as an economist, I always have to ask, well, why?
[02:22:42.254 --> 02:22:44.335]  It's like, I don't necessarily care what the number is.
[02:22:44.395 --> 02:22:45.775]  It's like, why did we get there?
[02:22:46.275 --> 02:22:57.441]  Well, because inflation is 14.3, if you're going to use interest rates to slow down inflation, it has to be greater than the interest rate, or the inflation rate, or else it's not going to work.
[02:22:58.141 --> 02:23:00.302]  So, fast forward to today.
[02:23:00.863 --> 02:23:03.564]  We've got, unofficially, inflation hovering around 15%.
[02:23:05.325 --> 02:23:24.176]  So to think that the Fed when they lie about all we can lower interest rates and we're gonna we're gonna have an emergency rate reduction right now because of everything that's happening in Japan and and you know what why they're saying that is because they know that it's a catch-22 of all catch-22s.
[02:23:24.896 --> 02:23:28.338]  If they raise rates when they haven't beat inflation yet
[02:23:29.076 --> 02:23:36.024]  It's actually going to it's just going to kill the economy because we have so much debt.
[02:23:36.465 --> 02:23:39.148]  See, this is where we were different from the late 70s.
[02:23:39.568 --> 02:23:43.033]  The late 70s, early 80s, we didn't have as much debt as we do now.
[02:23:43.653 --> 02:23:46.417]  So what what they're wanting to do is like, OK,
[02:23:47.318 --> 02:23:52.843]  If we raise interest rates to slow down inflation, it's possibly going to work, but it's actually going to kill the economy.
[02:23:53.304 --> 02:24:00.831]  So therefore, they're saying let's lower interest rates, get people spending, kick the can down the road even further, right?
[02:24:00.871 --> 02:24:03.294]  And they're avoiding this inevitable D-Day.
[02:24:03.314 --> 02:24:05.837]  But when they do that, when they lower rates,
[02:24:06.602 --> 02:24:12.185]  Instead of raising them to slow down inflation, they create more inflation, right?
[02:24:12.225 --> 02:24:13.746]  So this is the problem that we have.
[02:24:14.226 --> 02:24:19.109]  So as I look at this, there was this chart that I sent over to you.
[02:24:19.770 --> 02:24:24.292]  It's ominous charts that show a really bleak outlook moving forward.
[02:24:24.813 --> 02:24:33.458]  So there's four charts on here, and when you look at all of them, it paints an ugly picture.
[02:24:34.699 --> 02:24:38.807]  So that top one, that's money velocity.
[02:24:39.728 --> 02:24:44.137]  So money velocity is when there's no demand
[02:24:44.798 --> 02:24:45.438]  for the U.S.
[02:24:45.498 --> 02:24:45.899]  dollar.
[02:24:46.139 --> 02:24:46.679]  Like none.
[02:24:47.159 --> 02:24:48.140]  That's what the velocity is.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:52.902]  When it's way down like it is, there is no demand for the U.S.
[02:24:52.942 --> 02:24:53.323]  dollar.
[02:24:53.783 --> 02:25:01.627]  And of course there's not, Chase, because the BRICS nations are now getting rid of the petrodollar, trading in their own currencies.
[02:25:02.067 --> 02:25:03.128]  Nobody wants U.S.
[02:25:03.208 --> 02:25:04.188]  Treasuries anymore.
[02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:07.450]  Countries are dumping it like yesterday's trash.
[02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:09.071]  So there's no velocity.
[02:25:09.151 --> 02:25:14.214]  That means we are basically now stuck with our own
[02:25:15.535 --> 02:25:15.595]  Yes.
[02:25:15.655 --> 02:25:15.796]  Yes.
[02:25:26.454 --> 02:25:27.775]  That's the problem here.
[02:25:27.815 --> 02:25:31.558]  Now, the next one shows the S&P 500.
[02:25:32.778 --> 02:25:35.320]  This is a function of stimulus money, right?
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:42.285]  So when you print money like there's no tomorrow, you're using that money to keep the markets propped up.
[02:25:42.665 --> 02:25:45.987]  We've now hit this point of, all right, we're peaking.
[02:25:46.308 --> 02:25:49.450]  There's no real place for it to go except down.
[02:25:50.203 --> 02:25:57.592]  So when you when you analyze the markets, you have to say the stock market is a function of revenue, right?
[02:25:57.652 --> 02:26:07.945]  It's like they don't care how they get the revenue, whether it's you and me and everybody watching this show spending money, that's revenue, or whether it's the government.
[02:26:08.485 --> 02:26:11.107]  Buying the stocks through stimulus and injection.
[02:26:11.147 --> 02:26:13.148]  That's that's revenue for companies as well.
[02:26:13.428 --> 02:26:13.688]  Right.
[02:26:13.708 --> 02:26:15.029]  But that's a revenue.
[02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:16.770]  This is where we are.
[02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:26.857]  And so when we have no more built in demand for our currency, we're toast, because now whenever we do something like this, we're going to create even more inflation.
[02:26:27.557 --> 02:26:30.339]  So how can we tell the next chart?
[02:26:30.879 --> 02:26:31.619]  Federal debt.
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.861]  OK, this just tells us
[02:26:35.183 --> 02:26:37.346]  We've been printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[02:26:37.526 --> 02:26:39.528]  Look at our debt, right?
[02:26:39.589 --> 02:26:46.617]  And when you look at Bidenomics and his budget, you know, that they have come moving forward, what is it going to look like?
[02:26:47.218 --> 02:26:48.559]  You know, a cup, $2.8 trillion of deficit.
[02:26:51.394 --> 02:27:05.760]  So every time you have a deficit every single year, $2.8 trillion here, $2 trillion there, all of that added together comes to our national debt, which is now like $37 trillion.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:07.140]  I've seen the real-time ticker.
[02:27:07.581 --> 02:27:08.101]  It's insane.
[02:27:08.981 --> 02:27:10.642]  Well, it's absolutely insane.
[02:27:10.682 --> 02:27:15.384]  If you go to USdebtclock.org, it's constantly going up.
[02:27:15.924 --> 02:27:18.065]  But here's the wacky part about our debt.
[02:27:18.877 --> 02:27:25.621]  Right, we're seeing $2.8 trillion a year, $2 trillion a year being added to it, and we're only at like $37-38 trillion, right?
[02:27:26.241 --> 02:27:34.206]  But it went from 1776 until 1980 when Reagan became president.
[02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:36.987]  How much national debt do you think we had then?
[02:27:37.328 --> 02:27:38.408]  It wasn't even a trillion.
[02:27:38.768 --> 02:27:39.389]  It was like $900 billion.
[02:27:40.706 --> 02:27:44.488]  So it took over 200 years to go from $0 to $900 billion.
[02:27:44.828 --> 02:27:48.650]  Now, we are adding $2.8 trillion a year.
[02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.871]  A year.
[02:27:50.331 --> 02:27:54.993]  When Obama became president, our national debt was $11 trillion.
[02:27:55.673 --> 02:27:56.414]  Now we're at $30 trillion.
[02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:59.515]  It's like they are spending like drunken sailors.
[02:28:00.095 --> 02:28:05.538]  And this is unsustainable, which is why the rest of the world no longer wants our U.S.
[02:28:05.618 --> 02:28:06.078]  Treasuries.
[02:28:06.619 --> 02:28:09.080]  So therefore, what do people do?
[02:28:09.938 --> 02:28:10.158]  Right.
[02:28:10.218 --> 02:28:12.381]  So so you look at the last chart.
[02:28:12.421 --> 02:28:13.682]  This just shows gold.
[02:28:14.182 --> 02:28:23.672]  Now gold is absolutely starting to it's it's we're we're approaching all time highs right where this is why gold goes up.
[02:28:24.012 --> 02:28:32.801]  It thrives on political instability uncertainty chaos change on sustainable debt inflationary pressures all of that that we're seeing now.
[02:28:33.746 --> 02:28:45.352]  When I've been doing a lot of shows lately on Infowars and people are calling to say, Kirk, you've got central banks that are backing their currencies with gold and they're acquiring it and they're amassing it.
[02:28:45.873 --> 02:28:47.814]  Why don't you ever talk about gold?
[02:28:49.435 --> 02:28:55.698]  So the reason is central banks, they have so much money that they're dealing with.
[02:28:56.218 --> 02:28:57.539]  They can't really buy silver.
[02:28:58.171 --> 02:28:58.972]  Because it's too cheap.
[02:28:59.572 --> 02:29:01.273]  It's like less than $30 an ounce.
[02:29:01.453 --> 02:29:02.794]  There's not enough of it.
[02:29:03.395 --> 02:29:09.319]  They can't actually back or quasi-back a currency with silver because it's too cheap.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:11.421]  And there's simply not enough of it available.
[02:29:12.128 --> 02:29:14.631]  Which, so this is why they buy gold.
[02:29:16.052 --> 02:29:17.694]  It's 24, $2,500 an ounce.
[02:29:18.174 --> 02:29:31.147]  But here's where we, as people, can identify what's happening in the markets, the instability, the job numbers are awful, right?
[02:29:31.187 --> 02:29:34.570]  I mean, this last week, the job numbers are worse than it's ever been.
[02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:35.672]  And when you've got
[02:29:37.728 --> 02:29:40.389]  So four months in a row, declining job numbers.
[02:29:40.729 --> 02:29:42.109]  Now everyone's saying recession.
[02:29:42.509 --> 02:29:48.790]  Goldman Sachs says, oh, the recession propensity is going to have gone from 25% to 35% by the end of the year.
[02:29:49.210 --> 02:29:50.690]  Citibank is saying the same thing.
[02:29:51.091 --> 02:29:54.271]  Economists everywhere are saying, we are going into a recession.
[02:29:54.291 --> 02:29:57.012]  And I'm thinking, these economists are stupid.
[02:29:57.752 --> 02:29:59.772]  We already are in one, right?
[02:29:59.852 --> 02:30:00.092]  Right.
[02:30:00.152 --> 02:30:01.772]  It's not like we're going into one.
[02:30:02.052 --> 02:30:03.813]  We've been in one since COVID.
[02:30:04.333 --> 02:30:05.093]  But now,
[02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:13.602]  The reason why I don't allocate into gold right now is because silver is doing better, right?
[02:30:14.703 --> 02:30:16.183]  And there's reason for it.
[02:30:16.863 --> 02:30:21.245]  Silver will act like gold in the sense of it's a financial metal.
[02:30:21.285 --> 02:30:26.846]  It thrives like a barometer on uncertainty and chaos and turbulence and everything that we're seeing.
[02:30:27.346 --> 02:30:29.207]  But it's also an industrial metal.
[02:30:29.867 --> 02:30:34.750]  I've heard that like 60% of the world's silver is in landfills because it's used in so many electronics.
[02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:35.751]  Yeah, I mean you can't reclaim it.
[02:30:44.907 --> 02:30:45.047]  Right?
[02:30:45.087 --> 02:30:56.835]  It's not like when when the little squeak toy that you bought it at Walmart that has a circuit board on it for nine, you know, there's silver solder points that you you can't actually go and reclaim it because there's too much toxic stuff in there.
[02:30:57.416 --> 02:30:57.576]  Right?
[02:30:57.616 --> 02:30:58.677]  So it just goes away.
[02:30:58.757 --> 02:31:00.858]  It's not like aluminum that you recycle.
[02:31:01.339 --> 02:31:03.020]  Once it's used, it's done.
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:08.844]  So look at this article that I that I sent over to you on industrial demand.
[02:31:09.833 --> 02:31:14.374]  Could consume the entire silver market by 2025.
[02:31:15.414 --> 02:31:15.854]  All of it.
[02:31:16.514 --> 02:31:20.435]  Just as industrial, let alone investor demand, right?
[02:31:20.695 --> 02:31:20.895]  Right.
[02:31:20.955 --> 02:31:23.796]  So a lot of superconductors are going to be needed for World War III, right?
[02:31:23.816 --> 02:31:32.718]  So if the military industrial complexes of the world need electronics for AI and hacking and all this tech, it makes sense that there would be a ramp up in demand.
[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:35.961]  Well, and we're now in a war economy.
[02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:43.584]  You know, when you look at China and Taiwan and Russia and Ukraine and Israel against everybody, right?
[02:31:43.644 --> 02:31:46.565]  And it's like, this is a war economy.
[02:31:46.765 --> 02:31:58.490]  Every single ICBM missile that gets shot into the air or big torpedo that we're seeing going through the ocean, they have about, on average, 11,000 ounces of silver in each one.
[02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:59.371]  Wow.
[02:31:59.411 --> 02:31:59.971]  In each one.
[02:32:00.569 --> 02:32:00.749]  Right.
[02:32:00.789 --> 02:32:02.310]  So this becomes massive.
[02:32:02.370 --> 02:32:10.672]  So what is I want to say tell everybody because I get calls constantly like so many that why don't you go into gold?
[02:32:10.772 --> 02:32:14.193]  Well, look at what's industrial demand for silver.
[02:32:14.233 --> 02:32:15.093]  What's it used for?
[02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:20.195]  Technological advancements and high tech industries.
[02:32:20.895 --> 02:32:21.895]  It's skyrocketing.
[02:32:22.055 --> 02:32:27.337]  Solar panels, automotive, major consumers of silver, solar power usage.
[02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.270]  Right.
[02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:31.092]  It's like you look at all the green agenda and everything that they do.
[02:32:31.212 --> 02:32:32.273]  Electric vehicles.
[02:32:33.033 --> 02:32:34.234]  OK, that uses silver.
[02:32:34.794 --> 02:32:41.638]  So here's where we can actually say, OK, you environmentalists, right, that you want all this solar and all this electric.
[02:32:41.658 --> 02:32:46.081]  It's like we might not agree with their policies nor like them or think that they're crazy.
[02:32:46.121 --> 02:32:46.321]  Right.
[02:32:46.341 --> 02:32:51.965]  But but when we look at what they need, we can take advantage of it.
[02:32:52.025 --> 02:32:52.205]  Right.
[02:32:52.225 --> 02:32:57.228]  So rather than some of these trends taking advantage of us, we just identify
[02:32:58.234 --> 02:33:05.821]  And we even saw this week as the stock market crashed, we saw that a lot of the military industrial complex businesses like Lockheed did very well relative to the other major companies.
[02:33:25.754 --> 02:33:26.194]  Correct.
[02:33:26.374 --> 02:33:29.376]  They do, because this is because we're in a wartime economy.
[02:33:29.396 --> 02:33:35.360]  Investing is a matter of perception as much as it is reality, right?
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:41.824]  So if people identify in their mind, it's like, ooh, this thing is going to be good in the future.
[02:33:41.884 --> 02:33:42.825]  It doesn't matter if it
[02:33:43.285 --> 02:33:44.687]  It happens to be real or not.
[02:33:44.727 --> 02:33:45.648]  It's perception.
[02:33:45.988 --> 02:33:47.310]  Perception is reality.
[02:33:47.390 --> 02:33:55.599]  And when we've got wars and rumors of wars and inflation and all this, people are running scared, and this fear is consuming them, right?
[02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:59.343]  So therefore, in a war economy, silver is going to go through the roof.
[02:33:59.383 --> 02:34:02.366]  Now, here's the problem with all the demand for silver.
[02:34:03.069 --> 02:34:04.829]  There's not enough of it, right?
[02:34:04.869 --> 02:34:06.730]  So we've got mining challenges.
[02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:14.772]  We've got declining output from silver mines because all the easy silver has been found and taken out already.
[02:34:15.252 --> 02:34:17.312]  So now you have to go deeper into the earth.
[02:34:17.372 --> 02:34:22.133]  You have to build roads and build bridges and get the infrastructure developed.
[02:34:22.213 --> 02:34:24.194]  And that's exploration difficulties.
[02:34:24.834 --> 02:34:34.185]  I mean, you've got massive problems of declining output, and the COMEX depositories globally are simply running out.
[02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:35.606]  They're running out!
[02:34:35.746 --> 02:34:41.353]  So the supply is plummeting while the demand is skyrocketing, and it's a no-brainer from an investment standpoint.
[02:34:42.313 --> 02:34:44.594]  Absolute no brainer, right?
[02:34:44.614 --> 02:34:47.335]  Because this is our goal as a wise and prudent investor.
[02:34:47.595 --> 02:34:49.275]  Buy low, sell high.
[02:34:50.036 --> 02:34:50.376]  Right?
[02:34:50.516 --> 02:34:57.498]  When we can go into something where the supply is not there, the demand is through the roof, the prices are just going to skyrocket.
[02:34:57.778 --> 02:34:59.459]  Because ultimately, we do run out.
[02:35:00.089 --> 02:35:00.249]  Right.
[02:35:00.309 --> 02:35:05.514]  And when we run out, well, what is Sony and Samsung and Tesla going to do?
[02:35:05.534 --> 02:35:11.659]  They're going to say, OK, well, we'll offer whatever price necessary for us to get the silver so we can have a finished product.
[02:35:12.279 --> 02:35:12.440]  Right.
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:20.126]  So this is where when you own what they need and the prices go from 30 to 50 to 80 dollars an ounce, we get to benefit from it now.
[02:35:21.443 --> 02:35:24.286]  In the last so so you've got that going on.
[02:35:24.346 --> 02:35:36.861]  But you've also got now the fundamental reasons why gold and silver both go up and why normal asset categories that people are used to equities debt you know just money in the bank right.
[02:35:37.921 --> 02:35:38.981]  Those are coming down.
[02:35:39.021 --> 02:35:46.444]  So the fundamental forces that drive gold and silver up also cause those other equity and debt markets to come down.
[02:35:46.964 --> 02:35:48.844]  Now, we've talked about recession, right?
[02:35:48.885 --> 02:35:55.947]  It's more of a stagflation, inflationary recession, not just a normal recession like the Great Depression, right?
[02:35:56.027 --> 02:36:02.709]  But if you look at some of the stats behind what we're going into,
[02:36:03.991 --> 02:36:05.472]  Listen, this is really concerning.
[02:36:05.532 --> 02:36:07.013]  So, the U.S.
[02:36:07.333 --> 02:36:11.095]  unemployment rate has risen for four consecutive months.
[02:36:11.415 --> 02:36:11.616]  Four.
[02:36:12.056 --> 02:36:13.857]  That's the longest streak since 2008.
[02:36:13.977 --> 02:36:14.697]  Wow.
[02:36:16.038 --> 02:36:30.467]  So, over the last 75 years, and I'm telling everybody this to give them confidence that, yeah, the economy might stink, the foundations around us are eroding, the pillars are collapsing, but there's an opportunity to be had here.
[02:36:31.568 --> 02:36:39.003]  Over the last 75 years, every single time that unemployment rose for four consecutive months, the U.S.
[02:36:39.043 --> 02:36:40.646]  economy entered into a recession.
[02:36:41.547 --> 02:36:50.175]  Right, so on InfoWars, when I'm talking to you, a couple of shows we've done with you and with Alex, we keep talking about this.
[02:36:50.235 --> 02:36:55.960]  We're ahead of the curve, because now mainstream media is finally saying, we're going into a recession.
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.363]  We've been telling everybody for nine months, we're in a recession.
[02:36:59.783 --> 02:37:02.886]  So now, perception is becoming reality.
[02:37:03.546 --> 02:37:05.328]  And things are starting to accelerate.
[02:37:05.908 --> 02:37:11.673]  So the jobless rate has surged from 3.8% in March to 4.3% in July.
[02:37:11.993 --> 02:37:15.376]  That's the highest level since October of 2021, right after COVID.
[02:37:17.114 --> 02:37:17.855]  And U.S.
[02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:26.602]  hires rate has declined to 3.4 percent, lowest level since 2020 in the height of COVID.
[02:37:27.383 --> 02:37:27.583]  Right.
[02:37:27.643 --> 02:37:28.924]  So what does this tell us?
[02:37:29.204 --> 02:37:29.544]  U.S.
[02:37:29.664 --> 02:37:31.466]  labor market is contracting.
[02:37:31.926 --> 02:37:34.648]  When people aren't working, they're not spending.
[02:37:34.689 --> 02:37:38.392]  When people aren't spending, revenues are coming down.
[02:37:38.832 --> 02:37:41.174]  And this is where I think we're at the beginning.
[02:37:42.191 --> 02:37:42.331]  Right.
[02:37:42.712 --> 02:37:46.014]  It's a great excuse to subvert the dollars, the global reserve currency.
[02:37:57.387 --> 02:37:59.808]  Well, and it makes their job easier.
[02:38:00.208 --> 02:38:05.210]  So you've got Putin out there spouting off saying, we're going to de-dollarize the world and we're going to win.
[02:38:05.250 --> 02:38:07.691]  The BRICS nations are going to be the new reserve currency.
[02:38:08.232 --> 02:38:09.812]  But they still had this problem.
[02:38:09.852 --> 02:38:10.893]  And that's the U.S.
[02:38:10.953 --> 02:38:13.514]  dollar was still the reserve currency.
[02:38:13.554 --> 02:38:13.754]  Right.
[02:38:13.794 --> 02:38:18.736]  But but now you've got Biden, who's absolutely destroying the dollar.
[02:38:19.497 --> 02:38:22.419]  And Putin's got to be thinking, this is pretty sick.
[02:38:22.599 --> 02:38:23.640]  This is a cool deal.
[02:38:24.021 --> 02:38:27.163]  We're trying to destroy the dollar and we're getting a lot of help from Biden.
[02:38:27.203 --> 02:38:28.724]  We don't have to work as hard.
[02:38:29.665 --> 02:38:39.913]  And so the BRICS nation, there's this pendulum shifting moment that's happening right underneath our nose, Chase, right underneath our nose, where all of these things
[02:38:40.836 --> 02:38:48.642]  There's everything that we've known since 1944 when we became the world's reserve currency are now changing.
[02:38:49.002 --> 02:38:49.342]  Yeah.
[02:38:50.223 --> 02:38:52.224]  And it's hard to change that.
[02:38:52.324 --> 02:38:52.504]  Right.
[02:38:52.564 --> 02:38:58.148]  It's going to be very, very difficult because once it's gone, we're not getting it back.
[02:38:58.208 --> 02:38:59.729]  And I think it already is gone.
[02:39:00.310 --> 02:39:00.470]  Right.
[02:39:00.530 --> 02:39:03.392]  So let's just say Trump were to come into office tomorrow.
[02:39:04.554 --> 02:39:05.955]  Start turning things around.
[02:39:06.455 --> 02:39:07.756]  Growing the economy.
[02:39:08.236 --> 02:39:10.137]  Increasing our revenue as a nation.
[02:39:10.337 --> 02:39:11.517]  Increasing wages.
[02:39:12.058 --> 02:39:15.459]  Job numbers are going through the roof because people are working.
[02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:16.920]  Unemployment is coming down.
[02:39:18.035 --> 02:39:26.199]  I mean, even with that, that's going to be very prosperous for America again, just like it was once before.
[02:39:26.619 --> 02:39:29.040]  But is he going to get the reserve currency status back?
[02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:30.060]  I kind of doubt it.
[02:39:30.981 --> 02:39:33.662]  Because once it's gone, it's gone.
[02:39:33.982 --> 02:39:34.703]  What are you going to do?
[02:39:34.983 --> 02:39:37.304]  Go to China and Russia and say, hey, you know that
[02:39:38.044 --> 02:39:41.186]  That reserve currency that we used to have and then Biden destroyed it.
[02:39:41.306 --> 02:39:42.567]  We want it back.
[02:39:42.907 --> 02:39:54.015]  It's like they're not giving back because almost 70% of the world's population now in that trading block, we are not getting it back.
[02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:58.172]  I'm not saying that America is not going to be strong again.
[02:39:58.473 --> 02:40:00.294]  We just have to do it within reason.
[02:40:00.534 --> 02:40:02.175]  We have to control our spending.
[02:40:02.615 --> 02:40:07.659]  Trump is a great person to do that because he's brilliant at growing the economy.
[02:40:07.939 --> 02:40:10.441]  But the days of the U.S.
[02:40:10.481 --> 02:40:14.924]  dollar being the world's reserve currency are numbered or done already.
[02:40:15.384 --> 02:40:15.704]  Wow.
[02:40:15.884 --> 02:40:20.928]  So what does America look like as a successful nation?
[02:40:22.188 --> 02:40:25.491]  In the future, not having the global reserve currency status.
[02:40:27.013 --> 02:40:33.339]  So it just means that when, OK, and you need you need a smart president like Trump.
[02:40:33.579 --> 02:40:38.704]  Obviously, we won't be able to sanction Iran and China and Russia in the same way because that was kind of tethered to that.
[02:40:38.764 --> 02:40:38.945]  Right.
[02:40:39.810 --> 02:40:51.942]  Yeah, so I think what it looks like is one of the best things that Trump is saying to actually fix the economy is get rid of the personal income tax and replace it with tariffs on foreign goods.
[02:40:51.982 --> 02:40:53.423]  Yeah.
[02:40:53.523 --> 02:41:01.091]  That's what the founding fathers envisioned for our country, which means that's going to make all foreign goods more expensive because there's a tax on it.
[02:41:01.671 --> 02:41:08.278]  And that's going to force people to want to buy American, which means when jobs follow manufacturing, you've got more people working.
[02:41:08.659 --> 02:41:09.960]  So that's number one.
[02:41:10.241 --> 02:41:16.487]  You've got to solidify the money-making mechanism of our country.
[02:41:16.587 --> 02:41:17.248]  That will do it.
[02:41:18.743 --> 02:41:34.269]  Like, you and I, when we look at our budget, and let's just say we're losing, you know, so much money every single month, and you sit down at the dinner table and say, crap, talking to your wife and spouse, and say, we've got a problem.
[02:41:34.849 --> 02:41:37.090]  We're losing money every single month.
[02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:39.391]  And so what do you say?
[02:41:39.411 --> 02:41:41.192]  It's like, we've got to cut our spending.
[02:41:41.792 --> 02:41:43.513]  We've got to stop spending so much.
[02:41:44.173 --> 02:41:46.234]  Politicians don't do that.
[02:41:47.134 --> 02:41:59.737]  See, they look at their balance sheet and they say, we don't have a spending problem, we've got a revenue problem, so let's raise taxes because we're not going to cut our spending, which is why we have $38 trillion worth of national debt.
[02:42:00.317 --> 02:42:09.419]  So, what this is going to force us to do when we don't have the reserve currency is to look at the other side of the balance sheet.
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.923]  Not just when we have a problem, we need money.
[02:42:11.963 --> 02:42:15.650]  We go into the printing press and we either create... So the government's gonna have to shrink.
[02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:16.832]  It's just not gonna have a choice.
[02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:20.842]  They're going to have to, and this is where it becomes painful for the government.
[02:42:21.222 --> 02:42:32.067]  Because over 80% of all of our revenue every single year goes towards entitlements, mandatory payments, Social Security, women, infants, children programs, food stamps.
[02:42:32.607 --> 02:42:33.487]  They're entitlements, right?
[02:42:33.527 --> 02:42:36.829]  So if you start cutting that, you're not going to get votes.
[02:42:37.189 --> 02:42:40.790]  See, this is where you start to see social and economic upheaval.
[02:42:41.651 --> 02:42:43.632]  But how does it look moving forward?
[02:42:44.994 --> 02:42:46.957]  Discretion on our spending.
[02:42:47.537 --> 02:42:55.405]  You can't just go to the printing press without going into a hyperinflationary spiral like Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe.
[02:42:55.946 --> 02:43:04.635]  You have to have discretion, which means it is going to force politicians to think like families and say, we've got to cut spending.
[02:43:05.405 --> 02:43:09.389]  Unless we're going to go get three or four or five jobs, like a family would do, right?
[02:43:09.409 --> 02:43:10.990]  It's like, just cut spending.
[02:43:11.411 --> 02:43:12.792]  That's going to be the first thing.
[02:43:13.273 --> 02:43:26.986]  But when you start to do that, it is going to create a foundation for success moving forward, where our success is based on our productivity.
[02:43:27.586 --> 02:43:33.792]  And everything that we do, our success is going to be based on debt like it is now, which to me isn't really success.
[02:43:33.972 --> 02:43:34.572]  That's fake.
[02:43:34.872 --> 02:43:35.133]  Right.
[02:43:35.793 --> 02:43:39.076]  So so anyways, I think America becomes really, really strong.
[02:43:39.396 --> 02:43:44.521]  The only way that you can do that, though, and I'm not saying it's going to be an easy path to get there.
[02:43:44.721 --> 02:43:45.582]  It's going to be difficult.
[02:43:46.189 --> 02:43:56.513]  But the only way that you can do that is with a president who understands business, who understands politics, who's not a career politician who says, hey, if I need money, I'm not just going to print it.
[02:43:56.893 --> 02:43:57.494]  We need money.
[02:43:57.574 --> 02:44:05.237]  We have to create a foundation for success and encourage people to work and grow and thrive.
[02:44:06.041 --> 02:44:07.002]  Wow, man.
[02:44:07.022 --> 02:44:09.783]  Scary times, scary times that we're entering into.
[02:44:09.823 --> 02:44:11.985]  And thank you so much for coming on the show today, Kirk.
[02:44:12.005 --> 02:44:13.366]  It's always an honor and pleasure to hear from you.
[02:44:13.386 --> 02:44:16.127]  So wise and prudent and knowledgeable about this.
[02:44:16.147 --> 02:44:20.530]  I want to encourage everybody in the audience to visit KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:24.213]  Again, that's KEPM.com forward slash gold or call 7, 2, 0, 6, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 6, 0, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0.
[02:44:25.433 --> 02:44:25.814]  And ask
[02:44:32.938 --> 02:44:35.700]  Kirk and his awesome team about gold and silver.
[02:44:35.961 --> 02:44:37.982]  Silver sounds like it's the most promising thing right now.
[02:44:38.543 --> 02:44:50.792]  So as we enter into this, this new era of less economic dominance as a nation, you can still use this as an opportunity to personally thrive by going to kepm.com forward slash gold Kirk honor and a pleasure.
[02:44:50.812 --> 02:44:52.234]  Thank you so much for coming on the show today.
[02:44:53.615 --> 02:44:53.855]  Great.
[02:44:53.935 --> 02:44:54.776]  We'll talk to you soon.

[02:45:33.084 --> 02:45:36.487]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.
[02:45:36.627 --> 02:45:38.209]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:45:38.929 --> 02:45:40.210]  Superfood greens.

[02:45:41.170 --> 02:45:42.591]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:45:43.091 --> 02:45:45.712]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:45:45.812 --> 02:45:46.813]  Superfood greens.
[02:45:47.273 --> 02:45:48.194]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:45:48.314 --> 02:45:50.735]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:45:50.755 --> 02:45:51.755]  You might not like eating them.
[02:45:51.815 --> 02:45:54.937]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:45:54.957 --> 02:45:56.978]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:45:58.819 --> 02:46:06.204]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:46:06.524 --> 02:46:10.407]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:46:10.467 --> 02:46:13.870]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:21.135]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:46:22.596 --> 02:46:23.617]  I noticed the difference.
[02:46:23.957 --> 02:46:24.778]  I noticed the difference.
[02:46:24.798 --> 02:46:25.679]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:46:25.699 --> 02:46:27.621]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:46:27.942 --> 02:46:29.984]  But that's why turmeric is so important.
[02:46:30.024 --> 02:46:31.285]  Turmeric 95, 25% off.
[02:46:31.506 --> 02:46:33.468]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:46:33.568 --> 02:46:34.749]  The prostate support.
[02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:36.291]  Very important for men.
[02:46:36.812 --> 02:46:37.592]  Nerve Renew.
[02:46:37.833 --> 02:46:39.294]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:46:39.535 --> 02:46:40.556]  Both of those things are key.
[02:46:40.596 --> 02:46:41.697]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:46:41.877 --> 02:46:44.639]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:46:44.879 --> 02:46:45.559]  Good night's sleep.
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:51.823]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:51.903 --> 02:46:53.224]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:46:53.724 --> 02:46:55.505]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:46:55.665 --> 02:46:59.227]  Obviously, silver's doing way better than gold in growth, and it's way undervalued.
[02:46:59.247 --> 02:46:59.948]  That's a fact.
[02:47:00.428 --> 02:47:02.569]  Why, then, are the central banks mainly hoarding gold?
[02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:04.611]  Well, because there's simply not enough silver.
[02:47:05.211 --> 02:47:05.391]  Right?
[02:47:05.451 --> 02:47:17.057]  It's like, if you've got central banks that start allocating into silver, when it's $30 an ounce and they want to have it be part of their reserves, it's like, okay, there's not enough silver in the world to do that.
[02:47:17.657 --> 02:47:18.038]  Right?
[02:47:18.098 --> 02:47:22.760]  So they have to do gold because it's $2,400 an ounce, not $30 an ounce.
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:23.560]  Right?
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:26.242]  So this is why central banks own gold.
[02:47:26.262 --> 02:47:32.165]  They've got so many quadrillions of fake money, there's too much fiat to even buy the silver.
[02:47:32.705 --> 02:47:36.289]  Which I would say then means silver still will always be the thing that grows the most.
[02:47:37.470 --> 02:47:47.520]  So silver, historically the numbers prove out that when gold is in a bull market, which it is, we're near all-time highs, silver does better than gold.
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:49.022]  So silver grows faster.
[02:47:49.422 --> 02:47:50.603]  And there's a reason why.
[02:47:51.044 --> 02:47:52.746]  Silver and gold both act as
[02:47:53.266 --> 02:47:56.107]  Barometers to government distrust, right?
[02:47:57.087 --> 02:48:00.447]  The worse things get, the better financial metals do.
[02:48:00.487 --> 02:48:01.808]  They're a flight for safety.
[02:48:02.228 --> 02:48:06.549]  But what silver has that gold doesn't is it's a manufacturing metal.
[02:48:06.649 --> 02:48:07.769]  It's used in industry.
[02:48:07.829 --> 02:48:13.510]  So in aerospace, in defense, in electronics, in solar power, electric vehicles, all of that.
[02:48:13.970 --> 02:48:18.931]  The demand for silver is through the roof, Alex, and we're just taking advantage of that.
[02:48:19.671 --> 02:48:27.319]  And imagine what silver will do with Trump being president, somebody who actually grows the economy rather than having a stagnant economy.
[02:48:27.739 --> 02:48:31.863]  The industrial need for silver is absolutely going to explode.
[02:48:32.044 --> 02:48:32.524]  No, you're right.
[02:48:32.624 --> 02:48:34.486]  Silver is the closest thing to a silver bullet.
[02:48:34.506 --> 02:48:36.088]  That's why they call it a silver bullet.
[02:48:36.108 --> 02:48:39.611]  People should go to kpm.com forward slash gold right now and get silver now.
[02:48:39.631 --> 02:48:40.092]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.045 --> 02:48:52.548]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:48:53.968 --> 02:48:58.010]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:58.030 --> 02:49:00.771]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.
[02:49:01.532 --> 02:49:12.877]  And I wanted to talk about what's happening in the UK because a lot of people think that this is government incompetence and the failure of the leaders of Britain
[02:49:13.852 --> 02:49:20.735]  To adequately represent and safeguard the interests of their native population, and that's certainly a factor.
[02:49:21.436 --> 02:49:36.063]  But what most people are missing, which is something I covered pretty much all week on Twitter, I had a post that went viral covering a book that I mentioned many, many times, that's the Yoan Ratio book, The Milner-Fabian Conspiracy, because
[02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:49.321]  It's such a crucial text to know and understand what's happening in the UK because the model of what's happening in the UK is the same model for what they want to do elsewhere, particularly in the West, in the United States.
[02:49:50.142 --> 02:50:02.750]  And so I want to talk about Islam today, its role in this whole system of what the global elite are rolling out, the plans that they have for Islam, what they want to see it do.
[02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:05.952]  And even though Islam itself
[02:50:07.023 --> 02:50:11.866]  is a chess piece on the chessboard by the global elite, by Brzezinski.
[02:50:11.906 --> 02:50:13.026]  He wrote the book, right?
[02:50:13.346 --> 02:50:14.147]  Grand Chessboard.
[02:50:15.648 --> 02:50:33.317]  If we think back to the time of the late 70s when there was the Soviet Afghanistan conflict, Brzezinski had the idea to, following the pattern of British intelligence decades before him, utilize radical Islam or extreme Islam
[02:50:34.241 --> 02:50:35.582]  To fight against the Soviets.
[02:50:35.882 --> 02:50:37.843]  And the idea was to go into Afghanistan.
[02:50:37.863 --> 02:50:45.788]  There's a famous clip of him saying to the local Afghani population, that land is yours.
[02:50:45.888 --> 02:50:46.949]  God gave you that land.
[02:50:47.229 --> 02:50:52.592]  And he says that that will impel them in the clip, that will impel you to take it back.
[02:50:53.372 --> 02:50:58.495]  And of course, what's obvious in this clip is that for Brzezinski, God is a tool.
[02:50:58.856 --> 02:51:02.698]  God is a manipulation tactic to use with
[02:51:03.382 --> 02:51:12.244]  These rather simple-minded backwoods Afghanistan villagers to get them to fight against the Soviets in that conflict.
[02:51:12.304 --> 02:51:22.425]  And that ended up working because Brzezinski's plan was to wear down the Soviets through this conflict and to get them exhausted, to get them distracted.
[02:51:22.966 --> 02:51:29.647]  And that participated in the later decline of the Soviet Union in the 1980s and its eventual collapse.
[02:51:29.687 --> 02:51:30.667]  So it played a key role.
[02:51:31.768 --> 02:51:33.269]  In furthering the collapse.
[02:51:33.629 --> 02:51:40.092]  That's one example of the Western elite utilizing Islam as part of their strategy.
[02:51:40.853 --> 02:51:43.114]  Now that doesn't mean that they believe in Islam.
[02:51:43.354 --> 02:51:53.238]  So understand that from their vantage point, a lot of these worldviews are tools for conflict, tools for dialectics, tools for geopolitical strategy.
[02:51:53.278 --> 02:52:00.342]  In fact, one of the most famous neocons many years ago, who studied under the arch neocon Bernard Lewis out of the UK,
[02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:08.061]  It was a guy named Samuel P. Huntington, and he wrote the book Flash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.
[02:52:08.742 --> 02:52:16.063]  Huntington said that the future conflict would be between Islam and the West because the worldviews are incompatible.
[02:52:17.303 --> 02:52:18.804]  In other words, they knew a long time ago.
[02:52:19.044 --> 02:52:24.985]  It's kind of obvious that Western Enlightenment liberalism is not compatible with Islam.
[02:52:26.534 --> 02:52:37.647]  Islam has a perspective that sees all of life as underneath a kind of theocratic rulership of Allah, and so there's no areas of life that are, quote, secular.
[02:52:39.580 --> 02:52:53.284]  The inheritance of American philosophy, you could say, out of the Enlightenment, the American experiment, adopted the Enlightenment idea that there would be a kind of recognition of some god, a generic deity.
[02:52:53.764 --> 02:52:57.025]  Many of the Founding Fathers were Christian, but many of them were also deists.
[02:52:57.545 --> 02:52:58.945]  Many of them were Freemasons.
[02:52:59.525 --> 02:53:03.746]  And so the idea was that we're not going to attach any specificity to this god.
[02:53:03.766 --> 02:53:06.147]  It's one nation under a generic god.
[02:53:06.807 --> 02:53:16.033]  And so this idea then allowed for the pluralism within the American experiment, and it becomes kind of fundamental to America and Americanism.
[02:53:16.133 --> 02:53:22.598]  That obviously doesn't fit with the totalizing aspect of the way Islam understands God.
[02:53:23.058 --> 02:53:29.262]  So necessarily these two positions must come into conflict, and that's kind of what's going on in that book.
[02:53:29.887 --> 02:53:33.453]  But it's also engineered and manipulated at a higher level.
[02:53:33.994 --> 02:53:43.591]  And when we come back, we're going to look at many of the examples of strategists of the elite, the technocrats, who have talked about how they could utilize Islam to completely rewrite
[02:53:44.395 --> 02:53:46.857]  The West and its operating system.
[02:53:47.117 --> 02:53:48.097]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:48.137 --> 02:53:48.678]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:53:48.758 --> 02:53:50.459]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:53:51.319 --> 02:53:52.460]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:54.561]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:53:54.581 --> 02:54:05.988]  We're talking about the history of Western relationship with Islam and the usage of various Islamic groups and sects for various purposes.
[02:54:06.048 --> 02:54:09.511]  In fact, Islam as a whole, you could argue, is being used.
[02:54:09.751 --> 02:54:11.512]  I want to talk about that here in a second.
[02:54:12.074 --> 02:54:19.801]  And there's many books that I've read on this topic which help, I think, to elucidate the geopolitical role that Islam plays in the mind of the technocrats.
[02:54:19.821 --> 02:54:23.704]  And I think the first place to really understand that is to go back to the history of the British Empire.
[02:54:24.304 --> 02:54:34.713]  The British Empire thought, for example, that if they could control Mecca and have that as part of their, something out of their dominion, then they would have a huge amount of influence in the world of Islam.
[02:54:35.313 --> 02:54:37.615]  And to a degree, that makes sense.
[02:54:39.065 --> 02:54:44.048]  And that explains a lot of the policies of the British Empire and a lot of the operations that they engaged in.
[02:54:44.108 --> 02:54:46.049]  If you know about Lawrence of Arabia, T.E.
[02:54:46.089 --> 02:54:52.653]  Lawrence, if you know about Kim Philby's dad, St.
[02:54:52.693 --> 02:54:53.413]  John Philby.
[02:54:53.433 --> 02:54:54.594]  I always get him mixed up with St.
[02:54:54.614 --> 02:54:55.034]  John Hunt.
[02:54:55.074 --> 02:55:04.019]  But Kim Philby's father, who was the famous Arabist and intelligence operative for the British, who went and became essentially a Muslim.
[02:55:06.321 --> 02:55:18.308]  That he did that, you could debate whether he really believed in Islam or not, but he was doing it more so as an intelligence operative to help to carve up and establish the Middle East as we know it today out of the British Empire.
[02:55:18.348 --> 02:55:27.033]  So the British Empire is really the background to how we have nations like Iraq or even nations like Israel in terms of the Balfour Declaration.
[02:55:27.573 --> 02:55:34.397]  So the British Empire has to be understood to understand today's, the way the world is carved up today.
[02:55:36.957 --> 02:55:53.202]  Even though back at that time they understood the possibility of using various Islamic groups, what emerged was the idea to actually kind of coax and utilize more and more radical strains of Islam.
[02:55:53.342 --> 02:56:00.625]  An example of that would be the Muslim Brotherhood, which has a long history of being aligned with and funded by British intelligence.
[02:56:01.185 --> 02:56:04.746]  British intelligence has for many years, many decades, worked with
[02:56:05.894 --> 02:56:06.375]  I don't know.
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:26.164]  That doesn't mean that there aren't serious Muslims amongst those groups, but that is part of the history of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:56:26.184 --> 02:56:27.424]  And many books have been written on that.
[02:56:27.444 --> 02:56:31.427]  There's a great book that covers it called Secret Affairs by Mark Curtis.
[02:56:31.487 --> 02:56:33.468]  He's a Royal Society researcher.
[02:56:33.648 --> 02:56:41.172]  And so we know that being a member of the Royal Society, he's obviously got some clout and some pull in terms of academia.
[02:56:42.112 --> 02:56:44.714]  So I think those are reliable sources.
[02:56:45.778 --> 02:56:50.922]  And other books that have covered this, there's a book by Robert Dreyfuss called Devil's Game.
[02:56:51.763 --> 02:57:01.971]  He talks about, this book talks about the history of Britain and their intelligence services and their quote deep state utilizing Islam.
[02:57:01.992 --> 02:57:07.456]  And this one more so focuses on the US utilizing various Islamic groups for their
[02:57:09.563 --> 02:57:21.386]  Ends and but both of them kind of have the same principles the same patterns same conclusions and The sort of complex wide wild world of Islam.
[02:57:21.526 --> 02:57:25.986]  I think is really crucial to understand So hopefully we can maybe demystify some of that today.
[02:57:26.026 --> 02:57:37.929]  So those are a few examples of how imperial geopolitics has seen Islam as something that might be utilized in various ways But as we get into the turn of the last century the early 20th
[02:57:38.883 --> 02:57:39.804]  We're good to go.
[02:57:54.794 --> 02:58:06.802]  Re-energize British Empire for the world that was Cecil Rhodes's plan, but that didn't really work because after World War One and World War Two, Britain started going bankrupt and we had the rise of the United States as the dominant world power.
[02:58:07.303 --> 02:58:12.126]  So they realized in the 1920s, 30s, 40s that they weren't going to have a new British Empire.
[02:58:12.646 --> 02:58:26.114]  But the best way to go about this new empire that they wanted to control, this new technocratic super state, would be to bring the United States back under its fold and utilize it as the engine of the global order.
[02:58:26.734 --> 02:58:41.603]  This happened when the elites of the Royal Society, the British superstructure, etc., and the people that controlled them, this would be the Rothschilds, Cecil Rhodes, Milner types of circles, the Astors, the Cliveden set, they decided that
[02:58:42.239 --> 02:58:49.503]  The United States should have a secret inner group that ran it, kind of like the way that the UK was run.
[02:58:50.184 --> 02:58:53.165]  In the UK, they had set up what's called the Roundtable Groups.
[02:58:53.225 --> 02:59:00.129]  This is the Royal Institute for National Affairs and its idea of these Arturian Roundtable Groups.
[02:59:00.169 --> 02:59:11.356]  It doesn't literally go back to King Arthur, it's just an image, it's just an idea of how to model governance by wise men, governance by steering groups and committees, and so they set up
[02:59:11.966 --> 02:59:12.587]  I don't think so.
[02:59:29.017 --> 02:59:33.979]  And so you have this structure of a breakaway security state, which runs things.
[02:59:34.060 --> 02:59:45.645]  And this was the plan that essentially these British intelligence operatives gave to FDR and Bill Donovan when they came and set up this super state, you could say the secret
[02:59:46.165 --> 02:59:56.009]  Core breakaway intelligence operation that really runs things in 1942 with the National Security Act, and then it becomes the CIA in 1947.
[02:59:56.569 --> 03:00:03.631]  So these entities are examples of what we're talking about, of these steering groups, these breakaway inner cliques.
[03:00:04.472 --> 03:00:08.013]  This is what we mean by the cryptocracy, the shadow government, the deep state.
[03:00:08.053 --> 03:00:10.554]  That's who really runs things in the United States.
[03:00:11.401 --> 03:00:17.344]  And they run things in a kind of public-private way, so they're hidden in plain sight.
[03:00:17.364 --> 03:00:21.766]  It's not like a super-secret, hidden-nobody-knows-who-runs-things group.
[03:00:22.107 --> 03:00:27.950]  They're in the open, but they're also doing a lot of things in their private meetings.
[03:00:28.090 --> 03:00:30.491]  That's the Chatham House rules, so to speak.
[03:00:32.586 --> 03:00:52.690]  So, if we go back to the 1910s, 20s, 30s in the UK, the groups around Lord Rothschild and Lord Milner, they had passed away, but they handed on their legacy to the next generation who were running what they believed would be a reformed Marxist socialist order for the world.
[03:00:53.462 --> 03:01:01.987]  Reform Marxism is just Marxism updated for accounting for the fact that many aspects of Marxism had failed.
[03:01:02.027 --> 03:01:07.049]  So you had these elements in Marxism like the proletariat rising up and seizing the means of production.
[03:01:07.370 --> 03:01:08.170]  That didn't happen.
[03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:14.153]  And so the Marxist socialists in the UK, many of them, said we got to kind of update.
[03:01:14.193 --> 03:01:17.075]  We got to reform this because obviously
[03:01:18.223 --> 03:01:23.827]  Joe six pack is not interested in the debates about dialectics that Trotsky talked about.
[03:01:24.128 --> 03:01:24.968]  So we got to fix this.
[03:01:24.988 --> 03:01:26.349]  We got to come up with some new way.
[03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:31.393]  And they had the idea to align themselves with progressive minded, very wealthy people.
[03:01:32.034 --> 03:01:34.456]  This is what Fabian socialism is.
[03:01:34.536 --> 03:01:45.264]  It's Marxist socialist ideology that is not interested in an immediate bloody revolution, but using the techniques of social engineering and state craft.
[03:01:45.905 --> 03:01:55.372]  And the long march through the institutions to eventually seize institutional power over many, many decades or even centuries to then create.
[03:01:56.050 --> 03:01:56.610]  We're good to go.
[03:02:26.753 --> 03:02:54.504]  As we've mentioned many times over, and I'm not going to rehash this point because I've said it so many times, most of the entities that we know of in the world today that have a tremendous amount of power and call a lot of the shots, things like the CFR, things like the Royal Institute for International Affairs, things like the League of Nations and then the United Nations, the socialist organizations that exist out there in the world, the World Bank, the IMF, NATO,
[03:02:55.367 --> 03:02:55.607]  All right.
[03:03:12.586 --> 03:03:14.947]  behind most of what's happening in the world today.
[03:03:15.027 --> 03:03:19.089]  That doesn't mean that everybody out there is self-consciously a Fabian Socialist.
[03:03:19.109 --> 03:03:29.133]  There might be many people in these groups who are full-on Marxists, some that are Democrats, some that are, you know, who knows what, full-on classical Marxists.
[03:03:30.714 --> 03:03:34.495]  But for the most part, classical Marxism doesn't really exist anymore.
[03:03:34.515 --> 03:03:40.378]  Most people are not straight-up hardcore classical Marxists because a lot of what Marx talked about didn't come about.
[03:03:41.312 --> 03:03:47.379]  And so they've kind of adapted to, well, we got to morph with and adapt to and change to the times.
[03:03:48.115 --> 03:03:53.198]  And so they're much more amenable to monopoly capitalism as Marxist socialists.
[03:03:53.318 --> 03:03:56.460]  And so they have this hybrid view, which is what we're talking about.
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:59.081]  In the 1990s, this was called the third way.
[03:03:59.101 --> 03:04:13.169]  And the idea was that with the fall of the Soviet Union, maybe they could combine Eastern Sovietism into Western capitalism and create this hybrid synthesis system out of this dialectic of East versus West.
[03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:16.231]  And we just read, for example, Jacques Attali's book,
[03:04:16.852 --> 03:04:45.259]  Millennium from 1990 where he was he was talking about this he was talking about as a dialectical conflict of East and West of capitalism Sovietism and out of this would come this synthesis of some form of technocracy which combined both elements of capitalism elements of Sovietism communism socialism Marxism and this slow approach model they found to be a lot better than again the quick immediate bloody revolution of classical Marxism and
[03:04:45.922 --> 03:04:46.882]  Or of the Jacobins.
[03:04:47.443 --> 03:04:48.723]  That doesn't work very well.
[03:04:48.963 --> 03:04:52.725]  It has a lot of bloodshed, and oftentimes it just brings in something way worse.
[03:04:53.325 --> 03:05:01.028]  So why not use a longer, slower scientific methodological approach to bring about these ends?
[03:05:01.728 --> 03:05:06.171]  Now, a lot of people think, for example, that NATO was founded as an anti-communist institution.
[03:05:06.211 --> 03:05:06.631]  It was not.
[03:05:07.091 --> 03:05:15.736]  It was founded by Fabian socialists who were opposed to Stalinism and the NKVD and that form of sovietism, not socialism.
[03:05:17.097 --> 03:05:20.779]  And this is why people are always getting confused because they hear all these terms and these words.
[03:05:21.099 --> 03:05:21.760]  Who is this group?
[03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:22.560]  Is it that group?
[03:05:22.860 --> 03:05:27.143]  All of these groups that we listed are founded by people in the circles of
[03:05:27.890 --> 03:05:30.052]  Rose Rothschild, Milner, etc.
[03:05:30.532 --> 03:05:32.814]  Even the New Age movement from Madame Blavatsky, guess what?
[03:05:32.834 --> 03:05:34.015]  She was a Fabian socialist.
[03:05:34.776 --> 03:05:35.536]  So what about Islam?
[03:05:35.556 --> 03:05:36.797]  How does Islam factor into this?
[03:05:36.857 --> 03:05:43.203]  Well, I was happy to see that, you know, a lot of times when you read people's analyses of this, they're very one-sided.
[03:05:43.243 --> 03:05:44.724]  They don't have a nuanced approach.
[03:05:45.084 --> 03:05:49.588]  They don't really think about how there could be multiple things going on here.
[03:05:49.628 --> 03:05:55.753]  So a lot of times, right-wingers will think that, oh, it's all Islam versus classical liberalism.
[03:05:56.577 --> 03:06:02.159]  Or it's, you know, the terrorists that did 9-11 versus the free Christian West or something like that.
[03:06:02.179 --> 03:06:10.443]  I mean, this is just a super dumbed down, not even close to how it's really going on in the real world, how complex it actually is.
[03:06:10.463 --> 03:06:14.004]  So I want to try to demystify it and make it a little less complex.
[03:06:15.365 --> 03:06:20.447]  One thing that people don't understand is what's with this alliance between the left and Islam?
[03:06:20.467 --> 03:06:25.289]  We've seen this for a long time and there seems to be something to this and it doesn't
[03:06:25.916 --> 03:06:32.298]  On the face of it, make much sense because, well, doesn't Islam typically oppose a lot of these leftist principles?
[03:06:33.218 --> 03:06:33.778]  That's true.
[03:06:34.618 --> 03:06:38.740]  But there's more going on because it's a geostrategic thing.
[03:06:38.980 --> 03:06:41.220]  It's not really to do with the ideas themselves.
[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:47.002]  And if we go back to the early Fabian socialists in the 1920s, 30s, 40s, guess what?
[03:06:47.482 --> 03:06:52.963]  They were writing and talking about how to bring into the UK Islam.
[03:06:53.864 --> 03:06:55.124]  And they wanted this because
[03:06:56.161 --> 03:06:57.201]  This is their own writings.
[03:06:57.261 --> 03:07:08.824]  They wanted to replace the existing white population with a foreign population that had a diametrically opposed worldview on purpose, like Huntington talked about.
[03:07:08.884 --> 03:07:15.366]  Now, Huntington doesn't talk about this in like a conspiracy way, but he does say that these worldviews are in conflict.
[03:07:15.386 --> 03:07:19.747]  They're not, you can't assimilate these two positions.
[03:07:20.268 --> 03:07:21.908]  They're mutually exclusive positions.
[03:07:23.371 --> 03:07:31.935]  Well, it turns out that in the 1910s, 20s, 30s, 40s, many of the early Fabian socialists wrote many books praising Muhammad and Islam.
[03:07:32.835 --> 03:07:42.320]  Part of the reason for this, not the only reason, but part of the reason for this is that many of the British elite had gotten a kind of fascination with
[03:07:43.169 --> 03:07:43.509]  We're good.
[03:08:13.522 --> 03:08:16.344]  He was even inducted at one point into a Sufi order.
[03:08:17.205 --> 03:08:31.515]  Now he tends to be more of a perennialist and so he seems to kind of change and like all the religions, so who knows what he really believes, but he has at many in many occasions expressed a fascination and interest with Sufism and thus other forms of Islam.
[03:08:31.535 --> 03:08:36.719]  But that's interesting because there's a long history again of the British elite.
[03:08:36.999 --> 03:08:40.602]  It seems like about half of them were pro, for example, Palestine.
[03:08:41.392 --> 03:08:41.873]  I don't know.
[03:08:56.192 --> 03:09:00.214]  Of the power structure in the UK was very fascinated with and very into Islam.
[03:09:00.654 --> 03:09:07.517]  This led, for example, British intelligence to setting up a puppet Mufti in Jerusalem.
[03:09:07.557 --> 03:09:12.900]  The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a explicitly a British intelligence operative and asset.
[03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:18.221]  And that's because they really wanted to have that control there as well, if they had their asset there.
[03:09:18.241 --> 03:09:20.921]  And that's why you see him meeting with Hitler, for example.
[03:09:20.941 --> 03:09:22.562]  There's a famous picture of that guy meeting with Hitler.
[03:09:22.582 --> 03:09:25.962]  If you look up the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, by the way, he looks just like Ryan Gosling.
[03:09:26.022 --> 03:09:31.483]  So I've been making that joke for many years, but I mean, literally just like him.
[03:09:31.503 --> 03:09:32.884]  So maybe it's like reincarnated.
[03:09:32.904 --> 03:09:35.664]  He reincarnated as Ryan Gosling or something.
[03:09:35.764 --> 03:09:37.985]  I mean, I don't believe in reincarnation, but that's just a joke.
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:53.110]  The Fabian Socialists, to go back to these characters around the circles of Milner and Rothschild and all that, they also had a lot of associates like Annie Besant, Bertrand Russell, H.G.
[03:09:53.150 --> 03:09:53.591]  Wells.
[03:09:53.771 --> 03:09:54.692]  You've probably heard of them.
[03:09:54.772 --> 03:09:56.153]  We've lectured through all their books.
[03:09:56.633 --> 03:09:57.074]  Guess what?
[03:09:57.214 --> 03:09:58.975]  They're all interested in Fabian Socialism.
[03:09:59.736 --> 03:10:03.859]  And the clearest examples of this are the writings of, for example, H.G.
[03:10:03.899 --> 03:10:04.220]  Wells.
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:07.823]  Wells wrote that we would enter into a scientific technocracy.
[03:10:08.684 --> 03:10:10.725]  And this will be basically like Star Trek.
[03:10:10.745 --> 03:10:16.066]  We're all going to be living in the Federation and flying around in, you know, space coon pods or whatever.
[03:10:16.646 --> 03:10:18.427]  Of course, that's not really where we are.
[03:10:18.507 --> 03:10:25.189]  But what people don't know is that they all wrote about how much they loved Mohammed and Islam.
[03:10:26.369 --> 03:10:36.472]  Now, they don't believe Islam, but they had this fascination with this love, this desire for Islam to enter into the UK and Europe.
[03:10:37.572 --> 03:10:37.772]  Why?
[03:10:38.968 --> 03:10:41.909]  Islam isn't immediately compatible with New Age stuff.
[03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:45.989]  Well, they began by liking and appreciating Sufism.
[03:10:46.970 --> 03:10:57.952]  The Fabians were in love with Sufism, and it's actually a large part of Sufism that helps to inject the energy and impetus to the New Age movement.
[03:10:58.692 --> 03:11:00.672]  For example, Madame Blavatsky was a fan of it.
[03:11:01.052 --> 03:11:03.693]  Besant was a fan of Islam and Sufism.
[03:11:04.657 --> 03:11:22.249]  And so they brought in to the UK these professors who were promoting and were kind of missionaries for Islam through Sufism originally because Sufism is more of a mystical neoplatonic Islam and that's more amenable to a population that was still nominally Christian like the British were.
[03:11:22.930 --> 03:11:28.493]  So even though the Church of England is kind of a joke, by this time people were again
[03:11:30.625 --> 03:11:49.936]  Much more open to other options since the Church of England had becoming more and more and more liberal today it's just completely totally gone, but Even at this time it was it was becoming liberalized as if we were saying well, maybe there's other options and so they started reading Rumi the poet Getting into his Sufism.
[03:11:50.276 --> 03:11:54.959]  Theosophy was also very amenable to Sufism you started having
[03:11:56.158 --> 03:11:56.518]  I don't know.
[03:12:18.700 --> 03:12:19.000]  We're good.
[03:12:49.739 --> 03:12:50.740]  How would we create that?
[03:12:50.780 --> 03:12:56.243]  Well, we're going to have to get rid of Christianity, they say, the existing Christian systems that are there, and the Christian population.
[03:12:56.743 --> 03:12:57.463]  How would we do that?
[03:12:58.184 --> 03:13:02.446]  The best way to do that, they said, they strategized, bring in gigantic amounts of Muslims.
[03:13:04.467 --> 03:13:07.229]  So Sufism was originally the cultural engineering
[03:13:08.391 --> 03:13:16.775]  In the 1930s, 40s, etc., to eventually shift over into the more radical, quote, orthodox branches of Islam.
[03:13:17.235 --> 03:13:25.159]  They couldn't immediately bring in all of the Salafi, Wahhabi people who were already, many of them working for the British Empire and for British Intelligence, the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:13:25.199 --> 03:13:28.761]  They brought in the Sufis and then they warmed people up after many decades.
[03:13:28.861 --> 03:13:32.423]  Again, that is the Fabian slow kill model.
[03:13:33.543 --> 03:13:36.905]  Then eventually you've got essentially Muslims running
[03:13:37.992 --> 03:13:38.512]  The whole place.
[03:13:39.132 --> 03:13:41.673]  You've got Londonistan, as it's known, for many, many years.
[03:13:42.414 --> 03:13:48.956]  And this is why you've got British intelligence working with and protecting many of these, quote, radicals for many, many decades.
[03:13:49.596 --> 03:13:52.357]  How are they allowed to just run wild and do all this stuff in the UK?
[03:13:52.777 --> 03:13:58.039]  The blind shake, all these people who are obviously, you know, double agents and operatives.
[03:13:58.099 --> 03:14:03.240]  Well, because the intelligence services are not actually opposed to Islam.
[03:14:04.081 --> 03:14:07.582]  Now, people in the, quote, conspiracy world have been saying this for so long.
[03:14:09.039 --> 03:14:10.840]  Especially after the Big Nine event, right?
[03:14:12.761 --> 03:14:20.886]  And people who didn't believe in false flags and this stuff, they derided and talked bad about us and said how evil we were and all this kind of stuff.
[03:14:21.167 --> 03:14:29.572]  But I appreciate Rajiv because he understands that the operatives, for example, in the 7-7 event were working for British intelligence.
[03:14:29.992 --> 03:14:31.893]  They were people on the roll.
[03:14:32.954 --> 03:14:34.595]  Haroon Rashid-Oswad,
[03:14:36.491 --> 03:14:41.693]  Was recruited by MI6 in Kosovo when he was doing things for the KLA.
[03:14:41.733 --> 03:14:48.256]  The KLA was another fake Western created operation for the Islamic Kosovo liberation.
[03:14:48.296 --> 03:14:55.159]  That was Tony Blair and Bill Clinton selecting Al-Qaeda operatives to run those operations there.
[03:14:55.899 --> 03:15:04.143]  And one of those characters was Harun Rashid Aswat, who was then brought to the UK and one of the key figures in the London 7-7 event.
[03:15:05.399 --> 03:15:07.560]  So these, I mean, what does that tell you?
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:18.987]  In fact, you can still find the Fox News clip where they covered this, that Arun Rashid Ashwat was running that operation and that he'd been recruited by British intelligence.
[03:15:21.653 --> 03:15:23.294]  It's not government incompetency.
[03:15:23.755 --> 03:15:25.696]  They're so incompetent.
[03:15:26.177 --> 03:15:26.937]  Don't they know?
[03:15:27.037 --> 03:15:28.058]  They're so stupid.
[03:15:28.478 --> 03:15:33.342]  It's the same lie that allows the politicians to do all this stuff in the US as well.
[03:15:34.063 --> 03:15:36.184]  Biden's so stupid, what a boob!
[03:15:37.025 --> 03:15:37.865]  They're not stupid.
[03:15:37.885 --> 03:15:39.046]  The politicians are stupid.
[03:15:39.327 --> 03:15:44.811]  Whoever that British payer or whatever his name is, yeah, he might be an idiotic tool.
[03:15:45.828 --> 03:15:50.170]  But the people that are running these things in the intelligence services, they're not stupid.
[03:15:50.591 --> 03:15:51.671]  Now, they're not infallible.
[03:15:51.711 --> 03:15:53.072]  They're not omnipotent.
[03:15:53.372 --> 03:15:56.554]  But they knew all along these people were radical Muslims.
[03:15:57.534 --> 03:16:08.200]  And by the way, I came to the UK years ago for a talk, and I was accosted and interrogated for 40 minutes at the airport because I was bringing in books to sell.
[03:16:08.780 --> 03:16:10.061]  It wasn't thousands of books.
[03:16:10.461 --> 03:16:12.602]  It was a couple dozen books to sell at a talk.
[03:16:13.490 --> 03:16:18.734]  So they can stop me and interrogate me for 40 minutes and almost not let me into the country.
[03:16:19.674 --> 03:16:26.399]  But they can't stop and they don't know who Haroon Rashid Oswalt is, who worked for British intelligence.
[03:16:26.459 --> 03:16:27.620]  Come on, this is ridiculous.
[03:16:28.461 --> 03:16:36.246]  The same contradiction came out this week in the New Zealand COVID document that Alex covered.
[03:16:36.646 --> 03:16:39.248]  We'll talk about that in just a second, this amazing contradiction.
[03:16:39.589 --> 03:16:41.370]  This is the Alex Jones Show, don't go anywhere.
[03:16:42.193 --> 03:16:49.655]  Nitric Boost, Turmeric 95, high-quality CBD gummies.
[03:16:50.595 --> 03:16:55.576]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:16:56.076 --> 03:17:03.237]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[03:17:03.797 --> 03:17:05.758]  They let us private label their products.
[03:17:05.778 --> 03:17:06.658]  That's why you've already heard of
[03:17:07.538 --> 03:17:08.579]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[03:17:08.899 --> 03:17:11.661]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[03:17:11.901 --> 03:17:13.222]  This is just their brand of that.
[03:17:13.563 --> 03:17:16.485]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[03:17:17.246 --> 03:17:17.866]  That's the name.
[03:17:18.126 --> 03:17:24.611]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[03:17:24.831 --> 03:17:25.912]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[03:17:26.332 --> 03:17:27.954]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[03:17:27.974 --> 03:17:29.995]  They even let us use their name.
[03:17:30.275 --> 03:17:31.276]  It's now our best seller.
[03:17:31.496 --> 03:17:32.497]  We sold out of our version.
[03:17:32.757 --> 03:17:34.198]  Their version has a white model.
[03:17:34.539 --> 03:17:35.920]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:38.101]  You get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:38.281 --> 03:17:40.842]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:42.503 --> 03:18:00.832]  I was just reading on Twitter, somebody who presumably is from the UK was talking about how there are now 140 MPs that are explicitly, openly Fabian Socialists, including Sadiq Khan, including the present governor of the Bank of England.
[03:18:01.522 --> 03:18:04.643]  So understand that this ideology is not something that died or went away.
[03:18:04.663 --> 03:18:06.543]  It might be obscure.
[03:18:06.563 --> 03:18:09.223]  It might be something that not many people in America know about.
[03:18:10.144 --> 03:18:13.224]  But this ideology is very popular in the UK for sure.
[03:18:13.244 --> 03:18:22.726]  In fact, many of the Labour politicians have been covert and secret Fabian socialists for a long time.
[03:18:22.766 --> 03:18:24.406]  Some of them even more openly.
[03:18:25.907 --> 03:18:26.787]  So again, this is not a
[03:18:29.375 --> 03:18:37.477]  This is not a secret society or some sort of secret thing that we're going to hide in the shadows and nobody knows that we're Fabian socialists.
[03:18:37.517 --> 03:18:46.919]  This isn't a public organization, an entity that has, again, a very public symbology that they show quite often that they have a few symbols.
[03:18:47.039 --> 03:18:49.140]  One of them is the wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:18:49.900 --> 03:19:04.246]  This is the idea that, going back to Beatrice and Sidney Webb and others, that in order to make Marxism and Socialism successful, what they would have to do is don the cloak, the image of a enlightened progressive, of liberalism.
[03:19:05.086 --> 03:19:10.909]  Even though classical Marxism is not liberal, it's known as anti-liberal because it's opposed to liberal economic theory.
[03:19:10.929 --> 03:19:18.552]  And if you go into the history of Marxism, you'll learn very clearly that, very quickly, that they're not liberal, they're anti-liberal.
[03:19:20.706 --> 03:19:32.560]  The Fabian Socialists decided that it was much more successful to get on the cloak of being a progressive, of being a liberal, of being favorable towards capitalism and so forth, liberal economic theory.
[03:19:33.441 --> 03:19:35.343]  And so they sort of aligned and melded with it.
[03:19:36.138 --> 03:19:40.380]  And that was one of the key strategies that made them so successful in the UK.
[03:19:40.421 --> 03:19:43.582]  For example, Tony Blair was openly a Fabian socialist.
[03:19:43.642 --> 03:19:48.765]  His whole policy, his whole everything he was doing was part of that Fabian socialist ideology.
[03:19:49.326 --> 03:19:54.809]  So it is imperial reformed Marxist socialism.
[03:19:54.869 --> 03:19:56.690]  That's what Fabian socialism is.
[03:19:56.850 --> 03:20:00.252]  And it works together closely with monopoly capitalism.
[03:20:01.076 --> 03:20:01.916]  Explicitly.
[03:20:02.136 --> 03:20:03.437]  That's all you have to understand.
[03:20:03.917 --> 03:20:06.718]  And that's how you understand that that's the world that we're going into.
[03:20:06.778 --> 03:20:18.161]  That's why so many of these politicians who you're constantly fighting over between them being liberal or conservative or liberal or conservative, they're all working with the same basic ideology.
[03:20:18.561 --> 03:20:20.462]  I'm not saying that Trump is a Fabian socialist.
[03:20:20.502 --> 03:20:20.862]  He's not.
[03:20:21.382 --> 03:20:24.583]  Trump is just a straight up capitalist, I think, in terms of his ideology.
[03:20:24.643 --> 03:20:30.225]  But the Federal Reserve system, Keynesian economics, is Fabian socialist economics.
[03:20:32.263 --> 03:20:34.245]  John Mellon Keynes was into Fabian Socialism.
[03:20:34.265 --> 03:20:51.278]  He's one of these characters who helped to set up these institutions like IMF and World Bank, which are part of this gigantic Fabian Socialist structure, which is the governing ideological system of technocracy that is running the world in the West.
[03:20:52.339 --> 03:20:58.224]  Again, League of Nations, United Nations, these are all entities established from this mindset, from this ideology.
[03:21:01.781 --> 03:21:13.490]  And again, the intelligence services, especially in the UK, were never opposed to these Islamic ideologies, Islamic theology, or Islamic radicalism.
[03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:19.234]  That's why it's been fostered, allowed, and promoted in the UK.
[03:21:20.355 --> 03:21:26.400]  And people have been, again, so averse to this idea and thinking that it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:21:26.440 --> 03:21:29.222]  But this last week woke everyone up to this.
[03:21:30.367 --> 03:21:41.671]  Now people are realizing, hey, wait a minute, you know, idiot right-wingers thinking that they can make an alliance with Islam and now the Muslims are all, you know, fighting and attacking and pointing out that you're not going to make an alliance with this.
[03:21:41.711 --> 03:21:45.832]  This is a religion of submission and ultimately submission by force as well.
[03:21:45.852 --> 03:21:53.515]  It's not a religion where you debate and everybody's friendly and we come to these conclusions on the basis of rational discourse and ideology.
[03:21:53.595 --> 03:21:54.935]  No, no, no, that's not how that works.
[03:21:55.535 --> 03:21:56.876]  There's some Muslims who will do that.
[03:21:57.961 --> 03:22:00.502]  But ultimately, Islam doesn't operate in that way.
[03:22:00.562 --> 03:22:01.602]  That's a Western idea.
[03:22:02.222 --> 03:22:11.105]  So, it's silly to think that non-Western people are going to operate on the principles of Western liberalism and debate and enlightenment ideology.
[03:22:11.685 --> 03:22:17.587]  They'll only do that until they gain the upper hand, and then it flips, and then you get this system.
[03:22:17.767 --> 03:22:24.029]  Now, the crazy part, though, is that the elites aren't even really into Islam.
[03:22:24.582 --> 03:22:28.083]  But they see Islam as a very useful geopolitical tool.
[03:22:28.123 --> 03:22:28.984]  That's the key here.
[03:22:29.744 --> 03:22:43.189]  And I was mentioning earlier the New Age movement, that it's largely traceable, I think, to Madame Lovatsky, who was a Fabian socialist in the circles of Milner and all these Rothschilds and these people.
[03:22:46.023 --> 03:22:59.954]  She also, and the New Age Movement, also shares a lot of its origin with Sufism in the UK and the promotion of Sufi Islam and its syncretist kind of Neoplatonic principles.
[03:23:00.034 --> 03:23:09.081]  Neoplatonism is one of these systems which allows all of the world religions to kind of be subsumed under this superstructure, this perennialist type of structure.
[03:23:10.915 --> 03:23:34.175]  And also, by the way, Ratio makes a key point, which I believe F. William Engdahl makes in his books, particularly Full Spectrum Dominance, which is that the 1973 oil crisis was key because that allowed Bilderberg and Kissinger to make the decision, via OPEC and all that, to establish the Western reliance on Arab oil.
[03:23:34.575 --> 03:23:35.516]  Have you ever wondered why?
[03:23:36.542 --> 03:23:39.144]  I mean, we don't have to have Arab oil.
[03:23:39.484 --> 03:23:44.447]  Doesn't America have gigantic untapped oil reserves?
[03:23:44.607 --> 03:23:45.148]  Yeah, sure.
[03:23:45.348 --> 03:23:50.251]  But the global elite intentionally don't want us tapping those things.
[03:23:50.271 --> 03:23:55.954]  That's why there's these laws and there's these, you know, they pass laws against drilling on this continent.
[03:23:55.974 --> 03:24:01.398]  And we have to rely on foreign oil because of these deals that were made for
[03:24:02.344 --> 03:24:04.344]  Big globalist institutions.
[03:24:04.885 --> 03:24:15.887]  And Ratiu has a fascinating chapter on that, where he talks about how this was decided in the Bilderberg meetings via Kissinger and others, as Engdahl points out.
[03:24:17.628 --> 03:24:27.830]  Like other key British institutions, the Fabian-founded London School for Economics, with its closely linked Department of International Relations, set up by the Fabian Lord Haldane and his friend Lord Rothschild,
[03:24:28.393 --> 03:24:37.699]  Together with Sir Ernst Kassel in the 1920s and the European Institute have been running research courses and seminars and lectures to provoke the advanced thinking on EU-Muslim relations.
[03:24:38.359 --> 03:24:43.983]  In 2010, a new pro-Islamic outfit was created with the name of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
[03:24:44.423 --> 03:24:46.845]  It was added to the London School of Economics arsenal.
[03:24:47.165 --> 03:24:56.131]  The pro-Islamic stance of such institutions is demonstrated by their receipt of vast sums of money from Islamic regimes in other countries.
[03:24:57.065 --> 03:24:58.667]  And so, money had been coming in.
[03:24:59.127 --> 03:25:01.749]  You probably remember that famous banker, Peter Sutherland.
[03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:06.614]  Well, Peter Sutherland talked about replacing the existing populations of Europe.
[03:25:07.214 --> 03:25:08.155]  Famously, the banker.
[03:25:09.336 --> 03:25:15.662]  He was one of these key people involved in making sure that funding went to these entities to islamicize Europe.
[03:25:16.306 --> 03:25:30.253]  So understand it's not just outside Islamic powers and forces, it's the traitors within the EU and the UK, particularly in the Rothschild, Rhodes, Milner, Fabian circles, and the EU, because these are the people that set up the EU.
[03:25:30.813 --> 03:25:33.975]  Remember the same people that we're talking about set up the EU.
[03:25:35.216 --> 03:25:37.096]  It wasn't Hitler that set up the EU.
[03:25:37.437 --> 03:25:43.620]  He had a plan for his version of an EU, but the EU was set up by the OSS and the CIA on record.
[03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:45.841]  Bill Donovan, Jan Smuts,
[03:25:46.932 --> 03:25:48.753]  The European coal project.
[03:25:49.533 --> 03:25:51.153]  Those are all OSS projects.
[03:25:51.193 --> 03:25:53.094]  They're not projects by Hitler.
[03:25:53.834 --> 03:25:55.535]  So it's not true that Hitler set up the EU.
[03:25:56.155 --> 03:26:03.937]  It's verifiable on record that Donovan and the CIA and OSS established the EU, and it was decided on at the Bilderberg meetings.
[03:26:04.337 --> 03:26:10.759]  Daniel Asselin has in his book the declassified old documents from those old Bilderberg meetings about setting up the EU.
[03:26:11.379 --> 03:26:13.480]  And that was, they weren't doing that with Hitler, okay?
[03:26:15.234 --> 03:26:27.601]  Anyway, Rajiv goes on to talk about the decision to make the West dependent on Arab oil as part of this global superstructure that they wanted to set up.
[03:26:27.881 --> 03:26:36.586]  The same idea with making American manufacturing not local, but dependent on Chinese goods.
[03:26:37.247 --> 03:26:38.607]  That same strategy.
[03:26:38.707 --> 03:26:44.811]  Do you understand that the deindustrialization and sending all of that to other countries is on purpose?
[03:26:45.435 --> 03:26:49.577]  It's not just because they want to have a tax break, right?
[03:26:49.617 --> 03:26:55.301]  Like, if you listen to somebody like Peter Schiff, it's, well, companies just go over to other countries because of high taxes.
[03:26:55.541 --> 03:26:56.662]  Yeah, but they do that on purpose.
[03:26:57.162 --> 03:26:58.523]  To de-industrialize the West.
[03:26:58.803 --> 03:27:02.965]  Because these people said, we want to de-industrialize the West.
[03:27:03.065 --> 03:27:06.968]  And the 1973 Carter-era oil crisis was engineered.
[03:27:07.908 --> 03:27:08.429]  That's the thing.
[03:27:10.430 --> 03:27:12.591]  Because we don't have to be reliant on foreign oil.
[03:27:15.626 --> 03:27:16.586]  But now what do we have?
[03:27:16.747 --> 03:27:35.236]  Well, decades later, after 9-11, and after all of this, you have a Fabian Socialist Islamic-ish mayor, Sadiq Khan, who was a member of the Fabian Society, shadow minister for London, at least when this book was written.
[03:27:37.977 --> 03:27:45.181]  Many, many other, as we said, politicians who, as their explicit party stated goal,
[03:27:46.503 --> 03:27:48.445]  Is, for example, Tony Blair.
[03:27:48.705 --> 03:27:54.591]  Tony Blair praised the Quran and Islamic imperialism as a progressive move in 2006.
[03:27:54.631 --> 03:27:58.794]  So this is like a couple years after 9-11.
[03:27:59.675 --> 03:27:59.895]  What?
[03:28:00.356 --> 03:28:01.637]  A year before 7-7.
[03:28:02.338 --> 03:28:04.680]  And Tony Blair is saying, we need more Islam.
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:05.981]  Wait a minute.
[03:28:07.049 --> 03:28:18.779]  According to the official narrative of 9-11, it's radical Saudis and Osama Bin Laden that are waging this covert war through terror on the West.
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:23.503]  And so what is Tony Blair and all these politicians answer?
[03:28:23.683 --> 03:28:24.364]  We need more Islam.
[03:28:30.169 --> 03:28:31.090]  But they're not stupid.
[03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:32.411]  People who are
[03:28:33.374 --> 03:28:37.197]  Organizing the Fabian methodology and all this, they're not dumb.
[03:28:37.217 --> 03:28:41.961]  They're the people that set up all the institutions that we know today, including NATO.
[03:28:43.162 --> 03:28:48.946]  So why would we think and why do we keep defaulting to thinking that everybody who's running things is just stupid and incompetent?
[03:28:49.326 --> 03:28:52.749]  That is a cloak that allows them to keep getting away with more.
[03:28:53.509 --> 03:29:01.876]  Until you recognize and understand that the world is not run by total idiots, but that there is an Atlantis's power block,
[03:29:03.777 --> 03:29:07.182]  And I'm not saying that they're infallible or omnipotent.
[03:29:07.202 --> 03:29:10.287]  They do have weaknesses and they can fail at this.
[03:29:10.647 --> 03:29:12.230]  Many of the things that they push fail.
[03:29:12.250 --> 03:29:14.814]  Many of the things that they push fall apart and don't work.
[03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:31.499]  And we have to understand, for example, that to give you some good news, if you go back to Jacques Attali's books, if you remember, Jacques Attali said that when we roll out this technocratic order, there will be massive reaction.
[03:29:31.699 --> 03:29:33.681]  And he even gives the decades when he thinks that will happen.
[03:29:33.701 --> 03:29:39.885]  He says between 2020 and 2040, he says there will be a large uprising against this.
[03:29:40.745 --> 03:29:42.747]  And he says that's the one thing we have to worry about.
[03:29:42.787 --> 03:29:44.388]  And guess what he says is the main concern?
[03:29:45.228 --> 03:29:57.443]  He says Christian theocracy in the West and in America will make a resurgence and we have to be concerned with that as the thing that might foil the rollout of the technocratic global order.
[03:29:57.583 --> 03:30:02.189]  He explicitly says that in his 2006 Brief History of the Future.
[03:30:02.868 --> 03:30:04.049]  Jacques Attali is not a nobody.
[03:30:04.089 --> 03:30:04.989]  He's the Kissinger of France.
[03:30:05.029 --> 03:30:13.014]  We just covered his 1990 book a few weeks ago, where he said, in 1990, I'm being put as the head of this new EU bank.
[03:30:13.494 --> 03:30:13.795]  You're right.
[03:30:13.815 --> 03:30:16.336]  The official rollout of the EU was right around that time.
[03:30:16.976 --> 03:30:19.558]  They had planned the EU 50, 70 years earlier.
[03:30:21.959 --> 03:30:29.544]  And because of the fall of the wall, Jacques Attali says, I'm being placed as the head of this big bank here to help
[03:30:30.060 --> 03:30:36.645]  Integrate the former Soviet bloc countries into the EU and to get them under IMF debt and control.
[03:30:37.066 --> 03:30:37.746]  So that's how it works.
[03:30:37.766 --> 03:30:39.348]  That's the that's the Keynesian model.
[03:30:39.488 --> 03:30:43.051]  So it's not capitalism versus communism and that's old stuff.
[03:30:43.951 --> 03:30:44.111]  It's.
[03:30:45.192 --> 03:30:52.698]  Populism and local governance and the rights of individuals and people versus.
[03:30:54.159 --> 03:30:57.102]  Collectivism and Fabian socialism.
[03:30:58.183 --> 03:30:59.664]  Which is aligned with corporatism.
[03:31:01.562 --> 03:31:07.008]  And we still have people running around acting like it's the state versus libertarianism.
[03:31:07.108 --> 03:31:18.939]  I mean, this is just such a low-tier, childish, you know, non-nuance, non-reality-based philosophy or picture of what's going on.
[03:31:19.720 --> 03:31:24.285]  I mean, if it's libertarianism versus the state,
[03:31:25.037 --> 03:31:33.782]  Then why were all the corporations and the Fortune 500, Fortune 100 pushing all of the COOF stuff, all the Skittle stuff, all the T-R-A-N-S stuff?
[03:31:35.183 --> 03:31:38.224]  That's not state versus corporations.
[03:31:38.444 --> 03:31:48.950]  It's a gigantic, megalithic, corporate-private conglomeration, including all the biggest banks and all of the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies.
[03:31:48.970 --> 03:31:50.251]  They're all bad.
[03:31:50.291 --> 03:31:50.751]  That's the point.
[03:31:52.754 --> 03:31:57.095]  And so the way to break out of this system is to understand that none of these systems are good.
[03:31:57.135 --> 03:31:59.636]  None of these systems are going to save anybody.
[03:32:00.376 --> 03:32:10.119]  You're not going to fix it by pushing more classical liberalism, the philosophy of 400 years ago, which is totally not even relevant in the modern world.
[03:32:11.240 --> 03:32:15.461]  You're only going to fix it with a return to what the global elite themselves say is the danger.
[03:32:18.562 --> 03:32:22.083]  Real grounded theism
[03:32:23.277 --> 03:32:24.097]  Christian theism.
[03:32:25.418 --> 03:32:42.805]  What did HG Wells and Bertrand Russell and, say, Alice Bailey, another one of the Fabian Socialist witches in the circles of these people who helped found the New Age movement, whose philosophy was adopted by the United Nations, what did she say would have to be done?
[03:32:42.985 --> 03:32:43.745]  Does anybody recall?
[03:32:43.765 --> 03:32:45.306]  She has a 10-point plan to do what?
[03:32:46.807 --> 03:32:47.827]  To destroy Christianity.
[03:32:48.783 --> 03:32:49.043]  Why?
[03:32:49.343 --> 03:32:51.324]  A 10-point plan to destroy Christianity?
[03:32:51.364 --> 03:32:58.048]  She says we would have to destroy Christianity to bring in the New Age and the socialist world government.
[03:32:59.188 --> 03:33:01.009]  The capitalist socialist world government.
[03:33:03.871 --> 03:33:09.193]  Fast forward almost 100 years-ish, and what does Jacques Attali say?
[03:33:10.214 --> 03:33:16.737]  Our main concern is a resurgent, authentic Christianity in America and in the West.
[03:33:17.578 --> 03:33:23.901]  That would be the stumbling block to rolling out the Skynet Matrix Golem Project.
[03:33:24.021 --> 03:33:24.921]  He calls it a golem.
[03:33:25.522 --> 03:33:33.365]  Linking everyone's brains into a supercomputer is called a golem, which comes out of the medieval Kabbalist mythology, the golem.
[03:33:34.285 --> 03:33:41.248]  By the way, the famous father of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, I was reading a bunch of his stuff this last week.
[03:33:41.268 --> 03:33:41.809]  Well, guess what?
[03:33:41.909 --> 03:33:44.490]  If you read his book on cybernetics, within the first 20 pages,
[03:33:45.911 --> 03:33:59.960]  He says that, yes, I worked with the Rockefeller Foundation, MIT, the Macy Foundation, Gregory Bateson, and a host of other nefarious characters who just happen to be all the same characters that are part of MKUltra.
[03:34:00.401 --> 03:34:07.025]  So even Norbert Wiener's own book on cybernetics vindicates that it comes out of the MKUltra projects.
[03:34:07.265 --> 03:34:08.526]  He doesn't mention MKUltra.
[03:34:09.215 --> 03:34:17.399]  He doesn't have to, because if you've read the other books on MKUltra, you know that all of those entities are directly connected with him funding the various MKUltra projects.
[03:34:17.980 --> 03:34:29.886]  And both of the classic books on MKUltra, John Marks' book, Walter Bowers' book, both from the late 70s, end their books with chapters about how MKUltra transitioned into cybernetics.
[03:34:31.446 --> 03:34:33.487]  And what is, what's the point of all that?
[03:34:33.547 --> 03:34:34.148]  Well, guess what?
[03:34:34.188 --> 03:34:38.350]  Norbert Wiener wrote another book called God and the Golem.
[03:34:39.187 --> 03:34:41.949]  And the golem is what he's talking about with cybernetics.
[03:34:42.969 --> 03:34:58.017]  So in Jewish medieval philosophy and Kabbalism, the idea of a being with no soul that is then ensouled or controlled by the magician and created from a husk, the klephot, that's what a golem is.
[03:34:58.537 --> 03:34:59.198]  G-O-L-E-M.
[03:35:00.278 --> 03:35:07.042]  And so from that vantage point, they would see the masses as a gigantic golem
[03:35:08.228 --> 03:35:10.970]  Linked into the global brain.
[03:35:11.410 --> 03:35:14.211]  That's not my words, that's Jacques Attali's words.
[03:35:14.411 --> 03:35:19.254]  Jacques Attali says that when everybody's linked into the global brain, it's the golem.
[03:35:21.375 --> 03:35:23.476]  It's what he says in his book Brief History of the Future.
[03:35:25.457 --> 03:35:29.920]  Now, I don't think it's only Jewish-minded individuals or Kabbalists or whoever.
[03:35:29.940 --> 03:35:34.862]  There's all kinds of individuals involved in pushing this ideology and this project.
[03:35:35.683 --> 03:35:36.103]  There are
[03:35:37.208 --> 03:36:04.613]  Politicians, there's CEOs, there's people who are not partisan to necessarily Jewish mysticism, but they don't have to be, because they're all part of the same agenda, which is to roll out this technocratic control system, which always has the same models, depopulation, one world currency, one world government, tracking, tracing, and control for all means and medium of exchange, shutting off your wallet, social credit system, all of that is part of this whole thing.
[03:36:05.194 --> 03:36:17.402]  But Islam plays a key role in this, which we can't overlook or ignore, which is to be a kind of battering ram for the global elite technocrats to bring them into the areas where they can be used.
[03:36:17.582 --> 03:36:22.965]  So in the case of Europe, that was the most logical conclusion for the technocrats.
[03:36:23.426 --> 03:36:26.948]  What other religion and historic
[03:36:27.643 --> 03:36:32.825]  Antithesis to Europe and its pseudo-Christian history, at least the last thousand years.
[03:36:33.365 --> 03:36:35.046]  What other option would you do?
[03:36:35.506 --> 03:36:36.266]  There's no other options.
[03:36:36.286 --> 03:36:38.847]  You're going to bring in Chinese, you know, communism.
[03:36:39.467 --> 03:36:41.928]  You're going to import Islam on a mass scale.
[03:36:41.948 --> 03:36:43.329]  That's the only thing that makes any sense.
[03:36:43.589 --> 03:36:47.270]  And Peter Sutherland, these other famous banking elites, said that that's exactly what they were doing.
[03:36:47.470 --> 03:36:49.151]  So they openly said this.
[03:36:49.611 --> 03:36:54.953]  I remember when it came out on mainstream news that Peter Sutherland was saying, we've got to bring in more Muslims.
[03:36:55.658 --> 03:37:01.463]  To destroy the existing European state to create a more fundamentally homogenous EU.
[03:37:02.203 --> 03:37:06.327]  General Wesley Clark, everybody quotes him about the Seven Nation Plan.
[03:37:06.367 --> 03:37:06.847]  Well, guess what?
[03:37:06.887 --> 03:37:14.734]  He also had other quotes because he was at NATO, where he said that part of the philosophy and strategy of NATO is to destroy Europe, to make it a EU.
[03:37:15.935 --> 03:37:16.415]  He knew this.
[03:37:17.176 --> 03:37:17.636]  He admitted it.
[03:37:19.457 --> 03:37:22.878]  You're not supposed to talk about the Kalergi plan, but I have Kalergi's book.
[03:37:23.139 --> 03:37:34.043]  He talks about creating a homogenous Europe, a new European socialist state, and quickly says that the British Royal Society elite adopted the Count's plan.
[03:37:34.063 --> 03:37:36.364]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:37:36.444 --> 03:37:37.205]  He wrote a book about it.
[03:37:37.925 --> 03:37:44.868]  So remember, the books that they write, they call that conspiracy theory, even though it's public books, and it's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:37:46.033 --> 03:37:47.134]  Because it's not a theory.
[03:37:47.474 --> 03:37:49.915]  It's an actual plan that's rolled out in the books.
[03:37:50.416 --> 03:37:51.216]  They write about it.
[03:37:53.958 --> 03:38:04.584]  Anyway, so Islam also plays another role, too, though, in being utilized by Western intelligence, going all the way back to British intelligence.
[03:38:06.065 --> 03:38:08.406]  At the turn of the last century, utilizing
[03:38:09.861 --> 03:38:13.846]  A lot of tribal warfare, sparking tribal warfare.
[03:38:13.906 --> 03:38:18.971]  This is just imperial geopolitics where you keep the tribes working with each other to control those tribes.
[03:38:19.072 --> 03:38:22.375]  This goes back to Caesar, his diaries, and how he would control the
[03:38:27.117 --> 03:38:34.160]  Germanic tribes and other tribes, the British tribes that were the barbarians, he would keep them fighting with each other so that he could manage them.
[03:38:34.900 --> 03:38:37.601]  The same principle was going on with the British Empire.
[03:38:37.621 --> 03:38:41.203]  And I'm not saying that the British Empire started all the tribal conflicts.
[03:38:41.223 --> 03:38:43.844]  There have always been tribal conflicts in the Middle East.
[03:38:43.884 --> 03:38:44.684]  I'm well aware of that.
[03:38:45.024 --> 03:38:54.848]  But I'm just saying that imperial geopolitics typically plays on this ability to play up and exacerbate the existing local tensions.
[03:38:55.368 --> 03:39:07.980]  That's exactly the strategy that Brzezinski adopted, again, based on earlier British intelligence models for how they would utilize radical Islam in the late 1970s and throughout the 80s.
[03:39:08.020 --> 03:39:10.923]  In fact, go look up the Mujahideen at the White House.
[03:39:11.523 --> 03:39:17.709]  I mean, Ronald Reagan has the freedom fighters, the Mujahideen, which will become Al Qaeda eventually in a few decades.
[03:39:19.768 --> 03:39:21.849]  In the White House, actually in one decade.
[03:39:21.869 --> 03:39:28.993]  So from 1980s, right, Al-Qaeda is the freedom fighting heroes, meeting with Ronald Reagan in the White House.
[03:39:29.474 --> 03:39:38.379]  Ten years later, Al-Qaeda is behind the World Trade Center bombing, and there's this Osama Bin Laden figure, and we gotta watch out for him.
[03:39:38.399 --> 03:39:40.060]  And he happens to pop up again, 9-11.
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:43.041]  We had no idea what was going on, even though there was already a 1993
[03:39:44.850 --> 03:39:49.892]  It's all a bunch of lies because in reality, the system, especially in the security deep state, they know all this stuff.
[03:40:06.969 --> 03:40:09.671]  At least the ones at the Brzezinski-Kissinger level, right?
[03:40:09.731 --> 03:40:11.552]  People who are at lower level, they don't know this stuff.
[03:40:11.833 --> 03:40:16.756]  The lower level people are well indoctrinated through the education system to believe a lot of the bull crap, right?
[03:40:16.796 --> 03:40:18.398]  They believe in the dialectic.
[03:40:18.718 --> 03:40:20.319]  They believe that this and that.
[03:40:20.859 --> 03:40:22.761]  They don't understand black ops.
[03:40:22.801 --> 03:40:31.167]  They don't understand, you know, this kind of stuff until you get, I think, up in this higher level of people who are invited to things like the steering group committees.
[03:40:31.547 --> 03:40:35.010]  Then you get people who are more familiar with how this stuff really works.
[03:40:35.190 --> 03:40:36.011]  People who understand
[03:40:36.811 --> 03:40:42.076]  You know, what the Trilateral Commission is and who understand the technocracy that they want to bring in.
[03:40:42.096 --> 03:40:44.719]  So again, Islam plays a key role in being a battering ram.
[03:40:45.239 --> 03:40:54.948]  A hundred years ago, it played a key role through Sufism of being a kind of mystical door to open the way for Europe and the UK to be Islamicized.
[03:40:56.371 --> 03:41:10.020]  That then allowed for the election through guilt manipulation, through a lot of tactics, a lot of propagation, a lot of propaganda in the media, a lot of foreign entities using NGOs to truck in and boat in all these people.
[03:41:10.500 --> 03:41:15.364]  I went to Italy a few months ago, and several Italian cities had no Italians.
[03:41:15.864 --> 03:41:17.025]  In fact, we went to Genoa.
[03:41:18.005 --> 03:41:22.468]  I didn't see any salami, by the way, but in Genoa, it was like I was in Africa.
[03:41:22.889 --> 03:41:25.330]  Literally, it was like there were no Italians in Genoa.
[03:41:25.350 --> 03:41:26.151]  Pretty crazy.
[03:41:27.131 --> 03:41:31.613]  And the same thing has happened to a lot of the Italian islands, which are not Italian islands anymore, now they're African islands.
[03:41:32.973 --> 03:41:33.813]  And it's by design.
[03:41:33.833 --> 03:41:37.194]  In fact, you can go read the AP articles saying that.
[03:41:37.714 --> 03:41:42.596]  We know who the foundations and the think tanks and the NGOs are that are doing this.
[03:41:43.376 --> 03:41:44.076]  It's all public.
[03:41:44.637 --> 03:41:49.158]  So it just requires a little more sophisticated thinking than dialectical thinking.
[03:41:49.847 --> 03:41:52.968]  I want to remind you guys that I will be speaking next week in Nashville.
[03:41:52.988 --> 03:41:55.389]  You can go to the CognitiveLibertyConference.com.
[03:41:55.869 --> 03:41:59.230]  I'll be speaking there with Dr. James Lindsay and others, so you can get your tickets there.
[03:41:59.270 --> 03:42:01.350]  You can get my books at jasonalsys.com in the shop.
[03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:04.231]  I have two books on Hollywood and symbolism.
[03:42:04.271 --> 03:42:09.713]  I have my big fat geopolitical book, 660 pages on my geopolitical and theological writings.
[03:42:10.133 --> 03:42:12.693]  Go to the InfoWars store and support Alex by getting those products.
[03:42:13.394 --> 03:42:14.254]  This is Jay Dyer.
[03:42:25.069 --> 03:42:33.114]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:42:34.095 --> 03:42:37.857]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:42:38.317 --> 03:42:40.499]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:42:41.359 --> 03:42:53.787]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic.
[03:42:54.324 --> 03:42:56.405]  During the shutdown and then they would notify us.
[03:42:56.725 --> 03:42:58.585]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:42:59.206 --> 03:43:03.707]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and your info wars.
[03:43:04.427 --> 03:43:06.728]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts.
[03:43:07.708 --> 03:43:10.089]  We found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:43:10.109 --> 03:43:11.270]  Not going to say their names.
[03:43:11.310 --> 03:43:12.990]  They get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:43:13.810 --> 03:43:15.331]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:32.563]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:32.943 --> 03:43:39.609]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:43:40.672 --> 03:43:41.233]  We're good to go.
[03:43:52.583 --> 03:44:00.687]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:44:00.767 --> 03:44:07.410]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:44:07.570 --> 03:44:10.051]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:44:10.231 --> 03:44:12.152]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:44:12.352 --> 03:44:22.120]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:44:22.740 --> 03:44:25.142]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:25.202 --> 03:44:26.263]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:27.924 --> 03:44:34.627]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:34.767 --> 03:44:40.430]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:44:40.530 --> 03:44:49.034]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:44:49.094 --> 03:44:51.195]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:44:51.415 --> 03:44:51.535]  And,
[03:44:52.802 --> 03:45:06.065]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:45:06.586 --> 03:45:10.967]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:45:11.027 --> 03:45:15.668]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:45:15.988 --> 03:45:19.429]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[03:45:19.569 --> 03:45:21.910]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:45:22.010 --> 03:45:22.631]  It's amazing.
[03:45:22.751 --> 03:45:23.671]  It's super high quality.
[03:45:23.751 --> 03:45:25.632]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:45:25.712 --> 03:45:26.392]  Nitric Boost.
[03:45:26.572 --> 03:45:27.272]  Good night's sleep.
[03:45:27.512 --> 03:45:29.033]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[03:45:29.133 --> 03:45:29.633]  Nerve Renew.
[03:45:29.673 --> 03:45:30.413]  Prostate Support.
[03:45:30.493 --> 03:45:31.494]  Probiotic Formula.
[03:45:31.634 --> 03:45:33.154]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[03:45:33.715 --> 03:45:34.535]  25 milligram gummies.
[03:45:34.655 --> 03:45:35.815]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[03:45:35.835 --> 03:45:36.856]  10 milligram gummies.
[03:45:36.876 --> 03:45:37.456]  Works great.
[03:45:37.496 --> 03:45:38.496]  Turmeric 95.
[03:45:38.657 --> 03:45:39.797]  Libido RX.
[03:45:39.957 --> 03:45:40.577]  Better Mood.
[03:45:40.737 --> 03:45:44.159]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[03:45:44.279 --> 03:45:45.239]  Superfood Greens.
[03:45:45.299 --> 03:45:45.659]  Thank you.
