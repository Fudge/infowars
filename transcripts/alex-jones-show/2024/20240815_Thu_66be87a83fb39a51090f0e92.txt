[00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:22.444]  The Bohemian Grove was founded in 1878 by the Bohemian Club, which was formed in 1872.
[00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:36.287]  It is 2,700 acres of private land in Montreal, California, where every summer in July, hundreds of the most powerful and influential men attend what is known as the Cremation of Care Ceremony.
[00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:42.848]  An early version of it was photographed in 1915 and published by National Geographic.
[00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:53.876]  In 1989, a writer for Spy Magazine infiltrated Bohemian Grove and mentioned the Cremation of Care Ceremony, but did not mention the effigy.
[00:00:54.456 --> 00:01:01.321]  The article mostly focused on powerful drunk men dressing in drag and engaged in homoerotic behavior.
[00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:13.070]  In 2000, when Alex Jones captured the ceremony on video, you can see an effigy, a model of a person to be destroyed, being burned alive in a ritual sacrifice.
[00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.446]  This summer sets us free!
[00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:33.494]  Around the time that Alex Jones was there filming it, musician Kid Rock was there as a guest.
[00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:34.295]  Did you?
[00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:35.256]  He went to the Grove?
[00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:35.577]  Yeah.
[00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:41.543]  It was the first evening, and you gather around, whatever, the owl by this lake, if I remember correctly, which could be a little hazy.
[00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:42.525]  It was a long time ago.
[00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:45.408]  And, like, I've heard about this place.
[00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:47.771]  I'm like, this is some real secret ass shit, man.
[00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.215]  I can't believe I'm fucking here, right?
[00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.377]  And it's just a trove of celebrities.
[00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:55.159]  I met, like, Paul Pelosi and his son.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.900]  Oh, boy.
[00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:58.022]  And, like, Chris Matthews.
[00:01:58.723 --> 00:01:59.263]  Like, you know?
[00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:00.505]  But I was hanging out with them.
[00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:01.906]  We were having cool conversations.
[00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:02.907]  Kind of weird.
[00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:05.229]  And then they asked me, like, I had to come play my guitar.
[00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.611]  Oh, no.
[00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:08.352]  And, like, sing at one of these camp things.
[00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:10.034]  And I was like, I don't know.
[00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.157]  I feel so dirty.
[00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:23.761]  The oldest religion on Earth can still be found within many secret societies, the New Age movement, and hiding within many churches, mosques, and synagogues.
[00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:32.205]  The basis of this ancient religion is the attainment of counsel from advanced entities for one to gain earthly wealth and power.
[00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:40.309]  These advanced entities have a hunger for human life, which is how human sacrifice factors into this ancient transaction.
[00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:48.998]  By 2012, a handful of men were making individual claims that they witnessed human sacrifice at Bohemian Grove.
[00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:56.667]  Peter Chernoff says that the men taking part in the sacrifice went on to hold various positions of power in society.
[00:02:57.328 --> 00:03:00.492]  Peter, you've witnessed children being sacrificed at the Grove?
[00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:02.106]  You know, I did.
[00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:09.432]  At the Bohemian Grove, I was involved in a rather private ritual, Catholic Nazi satanic in nature.
[00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:16.118]  A service, a working, if you will, with nine relative ununknowns at the time, so to speak.
[00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:26.427]  Willie Brown, Arlen Specter, Barney Frank, Roger Mahoney, Ratzinger, who's now the Pope, Robert Byrd,
[00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.771]  Over the years, other people have snuck inside to take video.
[00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:30.471]  No way.
[00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:18.754]  In a phone conversation published by former Project Veritas employee Justin Leslie, James O'Keefe is asked about his recent attendance at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:19.854]  I was just a guest.
[00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:24.120]  I didn't see anything on there.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.444]  Some of our people that I've known for many years were there.
[00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:30.906]  If I saw something, I would tell you.
[00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:36.091]  But, you know, I think there's a lot of conspiracy theories and stuff.
[00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:37.252]  I didn't see anything.
[00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:41.396]  And there's a lot of people that support us that are involved in that.
[00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:52.349]  This year, the cremation of care ceremony was conducted on July 13th, the same day that Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt.
[00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:58.391]  This ancient religion is entrenched within the foundations of civilization.
[00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:02.092]  It is the culture that created democracy.
[00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:05.453]  It has been around for all of recorded history.
[00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:08.834]  People are just now starting to see it again.
[00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:13.056]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:29.906]  InfoWars.
[00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.147]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:31.867]  Today.
[00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.752]  Well, I won't back down
[00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:51.310]  No, I won't back down.
[00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:58.513]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:06.957]  Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around.
[00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:28.056]  And I'll keep this world from tracking me down Gonna stand my ground And I won't back down Hey, baby There ain't no easy way out
[00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:40.762]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 won't come easy.
[00:06:50.447 --> 00:07:14.677]  Well, I know what's right I got just one life In a world that keeps on pushing me around But I stand my ground And I won't back down Hey, baby
[00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:18.630]  There ain't no easy way out.
[00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:27.119]  Hey, I will stand my ground.
[00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.424]  And I won't back down.
[00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:35.629]  No, I won't back down.
[00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:43.483]  It's Wednesday, August 14th, 2024.
[00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:53.146]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting from the embattled and battle-hardened studios in Austin, Texas, worldwide.
[00:07:54.826 --> 00:08:03.229]  All right, another gigantically, incredibly important transmission that the enemies of freedom do not want to go out, that is about to go out, that is going out with 82 days left.
[00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:06.090]  The most important election in world history.
[00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.831]  Then we've got the insane 79 days of hell.
[00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:17.644]  Tacked onto that, after the election, 158 days to the inauguration of Donald John Trump.
[00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:28.393]  If he can stay alive, and if they can have a big enough turnout, at least 15 points, to override the 10% they've got baked in of fraud.
[00:08:28.413 --> 00:08:32.336]  All right, we have some big guests on today.
[00:08:32.356 --> 00:08:34.658]  Biba Fries joining us and others.
[00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:44.890]  We're going to cover huge developments obviously in the economy, in the world, militarily, the biggest yet since Russia officially invaded Ukraine two and a half years ago.
[00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.971]  It's taken place last week.
[00:08:47.591 --> 00:09:03.680]  It's really serious as massive numbers of mercenaries and a NATO force have chosen a rural area on the Ukraine-Russian border to just take over a bunch of small towns.
[00:09:04.707 --> 00:09:25.536]  They've now gone up to 60 miles into Russia, and they've got very advanced, brand new NATO tanks and weapons, and the reports are obviously highly trained Polish soldiers, and Poland's basically admitted they're involved in this, and it's mainly Polish tanks that are very sophisticated, some of the best in the world.
[00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:29.598]  And so, that's what's going on right now.
[00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:39.814]  And it's a huge escalation that every mainline analyst, and I agree with him, says is spiraled out of control.
[00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:41.475]  This is just completely insane.
[00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:52.587]  And just like Napoleon raced into Russia, and just like Hitler raced into Russia, Russia is letting him come in, and then is going to cut them off and kill them.
[00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:53.912]  I don't know.
[00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.130]  Extremely desperate move.
[00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.651]  We've got lots of Western denials that they're involved in.
[00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:17.233]  Oh, Ukraine didn't tell the U.S.
[00:10:17.273 --> 00:10:17.893]  they were going to do this.
[00:10:18.153 --> 00:10:20.775]  Oh, I'm surprised they didn't say Putin's attacking his own people.
[00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.996]  Remember, they said, oh, Putin blew up Nord Stream 2.
[00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:24.877]  No, this is NATO.
[00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:27.018]  And these are highly trained troops.
[00:10:27.638 --> 00:10:37.543]  And then the evidence is pouring out that it is a consortium of international forces with the largest contingent being Polish, French troops, British troops, you name it.
[00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:38.384]  And
[00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.102]  I'll hand it to these guys.
[00:10:41.122 --> 00:10:42.222]  I mean, they're real soldiers.
[00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:46.644]  I mean, they're invading Russia on the ground and going deep into Russia.
[00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:51.246]  And it is going to be just absolutely a bloodbath.
[00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:55.728]  And they are vicious.
[00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.611]  And so it's going down.
[00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:04.893]  And of course, Russia is not going to back down.
[00:11:04.913 --> 00:11:07.434]  So I'll be getting into all of that.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.005]  Really incredible news out of Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, which you have to understand is the same globalist.
[00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:22.150]  So the exact same censorship programs we're seeing that are so 1984 over the top.
[00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:23.651]  The judge.
[00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:31.218]  And you said, as I read your post on Facebook, that migrants are raping people at a disproportionate level.
[00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.259]  How outrageous!
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.980]  20 months in prison.
[00:11:40.498 --> 00:11:45.500]  You were at one of the protests and you yelled F you at a police officer.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.601]  18 months in prison.
[00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:48.962]  Giant fines.
[00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:55.565]  Meanwhile, the Muslims are running around attacking people with machetes and hammers and killing people.
[00:11:55.585 --> 00:12:00.387]  And if you try to post it anywhere, the globalists threaten to have you arrested.
[00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:03.608]  Including here in the United States.
[00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:05.209]  So that's over the top insane.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.921]  But, and there's so much more I'm going to get to, but here's the big takeaway, and here's the first thing I want to hit.
[00:12:13.142 --> 00:12:17.823]  You know, most talk show hosts will kind of build it up and say, next hour, I'm going to hit the big news.
[00:12:17.883 --> 00:12:21.244]  And so it builds up, and you stay on the show, or you stay tuned in.
[00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:24.525]  We'll be covering important stuff throughout the entire broadcast.
[00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:28.606]  I know most of the audience is already super informed, but see, you're the missionaries.
[00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.952]  Special Forces Operators Behind Enemy Lines in Captured America.
[00:12:34.773 --> 00:12:39.796]  You hear a clip you think is powerful, a report you think is powerful, you get it, you post it, I'll retweet it.
[00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:43.279]  This audience is the activists.
[00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:44.139]  Millions of you.
[00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:45.200]  You're the real power.
[00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:58.109]  So, whatever you hear on the show that you think is the most informative, whatever you think needs to get out, you get it, you boost it, you post it, and chances are we'll magnify it on the InfoWars account or the real Alex Jones account.
[00:12:59.868 --> 00:13:09.134]  You know, thanks to Elon Musk and all of you on there promoting this stuff, we're reaching easily, conservatively, 25 million people a day on Real Alex Jones.
[00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:11.916]  And then I can't even track it, but I see it everywhere.
[00:13:11.936 --> 00:13:13.357]  The videos are getting copied.
[00:13:13.858 --> 00:13:20.542]  And I'll see, wow, that video that got a half million on InfoWars, or on BadDotVideos, got 12 million over here on somebody else's channel.
[00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:24.945]  So the censors are pulling their hair out right now.
[00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:26.226]  They're really freaking out.
[00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:26.886]  That said,
[00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:44.908]  I'm going to cogitate on this, I'm going to ruminate on it, I'm going to let it baste a bit in my mind, and then I'm going to, probably next week, break some major, major, major, major news.
[00:13:51.072 --> 00:13:54.894]  I learned some stuff in the last 48 hours that is
[00:13:57.498 --> 00:14:01.059]  Not surprising, but still astounding that it's really happening.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:11.603]  So the feds, the corrupt feds, are not even hiding that they are involved trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:22.647]  And I have now been given all the information, I'm gonna leave it at that, directly from
[00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:38.850]  The people in the court, and I can tell you this, it's not that I'm not supposed to tell you, it's that if I just tell you this now, it'll kind of be like, okay, but I'm going to really tell you about it.
[00:14:40.368 --> 00:14:43.929]  And then kind of the history of what's happened so far, because this is the model for everybody else.
[00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:53.052]  But the Justice Department, it's not just undercover videos of FBI and CIA agents talking about how they set me up and framed me and then how it's a beta test for everybody else.
[00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:56.833]  Cut Jones's legs off, you know, take his money away, all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:04.876]  It's not just the head of the FBI in Connecticut testifying that he ran the whole operation against me in the show trial against me.
[00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:18.731]  It's that they are openly working with well-known billionaires, and we now have the names, to shut this place down.
[00:15:20.112 --> 00:15:25.176]  And when I tell you what they're doing, it's bold, man.
[00:15:25.336 --> 00:15:26.777]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[00:15:28.258 --> 00:15:31.201]  And obviously, this is as illegal as hell, what they're doing.
[00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:34.163]  But what it is, is desperation, folks.
[00:15:34.223 --> 00:15:36.085]  I mean, the globalists tried to kill Trump.
[00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:38.779]  31 days ago in front of everybody.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.241]  By the grace of God, it just nicked his ear.
[00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.142]  He just got grazed.
[00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:44.744]  But another person died and two got critically wounded.
[00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:54.592]  And I guess it's just really the realization, even myself, that man, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:58.475]  And I know I just keep saying that because it's true.
[00:15:59.356 --> 00:16:01.378]  But I mean, I want to say this before going further.
[00:16:06.144 --> 00:16:07.265]  I'm exactly where I want to be.
[00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:11.126]  And I've been put to the ringer and I've been persecuted and I've been attacked.
[00:16:11.586 --> 00:16:13.447]  But I've gotten to know the best people out there.
[00:16:13.467 --> 00:16:15.408]  You don't just get to know the bad guys, you get to know the good guys.
[00:16:16.349 --> 00:16:19.250]  And you get to see who's who when you go through something like this.
[00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.311]  And this is a real war for America and the future of the planet.
[00:16:23.452 --> 00:16:24.932]  Against tyranny, against scientific evil.
[00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:28.994]  And all of you are now veterans of a bioweapon attack.
[00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:32.636]  The COVID release and the poison shots.
[00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:35.417]  And we're just living through
[00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:42.126]  Such a historic time, and the only reason I'm still on air and not in jail and not dead is because of God.
[00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:52.451]  God, working through you and working through me, is carrying us through this, and we're going to see miraculous things happen.
[00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:53.272]  We've already seen that.
[00:16:55.573 --> 00:16:56.834]  And you saw it all over the news.
[00:16:57.742 --> 00:16:59.563]  They wanted me shut down seven weeks ago.
[00:17:00.124 --> 00:17:01.425]  Tried to shut us down without a court order.
[00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:04.347]  I mean, that whole thing, it's just an insane story.
[00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.628]  And it's all on record, and I can't even believe it.
[00:17:06.668 --> 00:17:07.629]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.273]  I mean, I'm telling people what happened, and they're even admitting it in the news, and I'm just like, this is America?
[00:17:13.773 --> 00:17:14.654]  Well, you just saw England.
[00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:20.518]  You said Muslims disproportionately rape 20 months!
[00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.379]  And it's a damn fact!
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.521]  But the person has a right to even be wrong!
[00:17:26.203 --> 00:17:28.925]  What if a guy wants to walk down the street and say Martians are raping women?
[00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:33.308]  Okay, it's not true, but just go ahead and say it.
[00:17:34.989 --> 00:17:36.790]  If you want to run around and say Santa Claus is real.
[00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:43.355]  But the point is, the Islamists are over 70% of the rapes in Europe.
[00:17:44.876 --> 00:17:45.656]  In many areas, it's like 85%.
[00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:50.640]  Because that's literally what they're coming to Europe for.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.722]  Because in their countries, women wear beekeeper outfits.
[00:17:55.899 --> 00:17:58.781]  The only women they've ever seen is their mama or their sisters in the house.
[00:18:00.082 --> 00:18:05.046]  To them, it's just like, they see women with lipstick and beautiful hair and nice clothes, they're like, what the hell is this?
[00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.428]  To them, America and Europe is like a giant strip club.
[00:18:10.129 --> 00:18:14.713]  And if a woman is seen out, she's a whore owned by somebody.
[00:18:15.834 --> 00:18:20.237]  So to them, well, I'm allowed to rape this woman because she's wearing a short skirt.
[00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:22.999]  Or she doesn't have a hood over her head.
[00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:29.151]  I mean, I've been in restaurants in Austin where women are wearing full hoods, eating spaghetti, and they're going like this, eating spaghetti under it.
[00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:32.193]  I've seen that at least 10 times.
[00:18:32.774 --> 00:18:33.815]  I can't even finish my meal.
[00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:35.116]  I'm just like, what the hell?
[00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:36.276]  Ice tea?
[00:18:40.626 --> 00:18:58.503]  I got three daughters, man, and then the left and the feminists back it and say it's great, and you see Berlin protests and New York protests with women with hair under their arms, their ugly, you know, leftist breasts hanging out with their purple hair, and they're like, we love Islam, we love Sharia law, what a group of freakazoids, you know, gays for Islam!
[00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:02.567]  That is, uh...
[00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:06.177]  Like Netanyahu said, I don't like Netanyahu.
[00:19:06.357 --> 00:19:07.018]  It's a funny line.
[00:19:07.038 --> 00:19:09.159]  He's like, that's like saying chickens for KFC.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.722]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:19:15.224 --> 00:19:17.386]  So I'm going to move on to the big news now.
[00:19:17.746 --> 00:19:25.513]  It's just that for strategic reasons, I'm working with some smart people, but I make the final decisions.
[00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:30.457]  They don't want me to talk about this just yet, but
[00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:33.982]  I'm going to talk about it.
[00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:37.644]  I'm just going to be very thoughtful about it.
[00:19:39.965 --> 00:19:44.107]  But it's when you hear this, you're going to go, well, of course, but it's still it's it's just insane.
[00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:52.652]  It's so wild.
[00:19:55.234 --> 00:20:02.518]  You understand the FBI and the CIA openly with multiple Democrat top donor billionaires
[00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:05.999]  Are preparing to go public.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.001]  They're so proud of themselves.
[00:20:09.262 --> 00:20:10.903]  And announce a plan to close this place.
[00:20:12.904 --> 00:20:13.845]  And I have the runway.
[00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.146]  I know when they're going to do it.
[00:20:15.626 --> 00:20:15.967]  All of it.
[00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:20.230]  Just learned about it two days ago.
[00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.071]  Confirmed it yesterday.
[00:20:24.133 --> 00:20:25.574]  With federal officials.
[00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:28.476]  On the telephone.
[00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:31.218]  So.
[00:20:34.045 --> 00:20:42.713]  And I knew the Justice Department was in control, obviously the CRO that tried to set us up and did all that stuff, but now they're not even, they're like, well yeah, you're a bad person, of course we're trying to set you up.
[00:20:43.374 --> 00:20:45.196]  It's like they're so deranged.
[00:20:46.377 --> 00:20:57.908]  They literally act like I'm Lex Luthor and I'm this horrible person and they've just been absolutely criminally raping the living hell out of me and my crew, my family, and they just think it's completely normal to act like this!
[00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:04.254]  Like the judge.
[00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:06.376]  There's a bunch of these judges in England.
[00:21:06.796 --> 00:21:10.019]  You said F you to the police 18 months.
[00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:14.002]  You said Muslims disproportionately rape 20 months.
[00:21:14.963 --> 00:21:22.190]  You were not protesting but you walked out of the sandwich shop and stared for 2 minutes and were caught on tape 10 months.
[00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.552]  You watched it for 2 minutes.
[00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.253]  Now, have you been running around with a machete and, you know, pulling people out of cars because they were white?
[00:21:33.873 --> 00:21:35.134]  Oh, good job, Islam!
[00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:36.175]  As-salamu alaykum!
[00:21:40.138 --> 00:21:43.020]  Just the injustice, the savageness of it.
[00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:54.569]  And I showed you yesterday, like, dozens of headlines in France and Sweden and Germany and England, where if the newspaper reporter prints crime statistics that Muslims are committing 70 plus percent of their rapes,
[00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:56.083]  We're good to go.
[00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:30.985]  The globalists try to shut you down and censor you or put you in jail if you expose the poison shots, or if you expose the open borders, or you expose the rape gangs, or you expose any of it, and they're trying to bring all that here, and I've got articles with actually doing it in America now.
[00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:41.628]  One guy went to Capitol for one minute, didn't hurt anybody, was told to leave left, and the judge said, you're not allowed to use the internet or make any comments about politics.
[00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.949]  And they just called him back into court and said,
[00:22:46.371 --> 00:22:50.552]  You, of course it was in an English accent because it was in the US.
[00:22:50.692 --> 00:22:53.353]  I've got the article right here and he goes, I've got the transcript.
[00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:57.234]  You have made pro-Trump posts and other conspiracy theories.
[00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:01.575]  You are going back to jail, buddy boy.
[00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:09.417]  And so they have a monitoring system with an IP address on his computer.
[00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.917]  And if he's caught going to any political website, he goes back to jail.
[00:23:13.418 --> 00:23:15.098]  I mean, just come on, folks.
[00:23:19.073 --> 00:23:20.875]  And they put the FBI on the stand in Connecticut.
[00:23:23.056 --> 00:23:35.106]  The head counsel for the FBI, their head lawyer, he's like, yeah, I went and got the families together, and then we went to the Costco firm, and we brought this up to them, and we got these lawsuits organized and everything.
[00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:37.008]  And my lawyer's like, what did Alex do to you?
[00:23:37.028 --> 00:23:39.270]  Did he ever say your name?
[00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.490]  No.
[00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.391]  Did any of his crew ever say your name?
[00:23:40.431 --> 00:23:40.571]  No.
[00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:41.452]  Did he ever write an article about you?
[00:23:41.492 --> 00:23:41.612]  No.
[00:23:42.272 --> 00:23:43.453]  I never heard the guy's name until he sued me.
[00:23:43.473 --> 00:23:44.394]  They gave him $130 million.
[00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:45.235]  That didn't exist.
[00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:47.778]  And he goes, no.
[00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:49.319]  Did Alex Jones ever say your name?
[00:23:49.439 --> 00:23:49.819]  No.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.660]  Well, what happened to you?
[00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.023]  A man called me once in my office to see if I was real.
[00:23:58.746 --> 00:24:04.670]  I mean, the crimes, and then I go outside the court, and there's the reporter who's got his own local website and radio show.
[00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:05.911]  Pretty good show, actually.
[00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:06.551]  I listened to it.
[00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:07.452]  I didn't know he was until then.
[00:24:07.792 --> 00:24:09.113]  He's like, Alex, I want to come on your show.
[00:24:09.373 --> 00:24:10.094]  This is BS.
[00:24:10.134 --> 00:24:11.375]  You know, I'm the guy he's talking about.
[00:24:11.415 --> 00:24:12.176]  I'm the guy that called.
[00:24:12.696 --> 00:24:15.198]  And then on the stand, they ask him about it again, and he goes, yeah, that's the guy.
[00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:17.632]  Oh my god, a reporter called him!
[00:24:21.174 --> 00:24:24.636]  But, but... I mean, that's what these people do.
[00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:30.160]  Mr. Jones peed on graves.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.041]  Mr. Jones, it's all BS.
[00:24:34.802 --> 00:24:36.403]  Just like Trump hates all Mexicans.
[00:24:36.443 --> 00:24:37.044]  Never said it.
[00:24:37.944 --> 00:24:39.045]  That's why you never saw the clip.
[00:24:39.285 --> 00:24:40.026]  Doesn't exist.
[00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:42.967]  So...
[00:24:44.306 --> 00:24:45.706]  I'm gonna stop talking about that now.
[00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:47.787]  I'm just blown away at this point.
[00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:51.248]  And see, they think they're gonna bring in a dictatorship.
[00:24:51.268 --> 00:24:59.070]  They think that no matter what they do, they're going for broke, they're going all the way, and the general public still doesn't realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:04.871]  People are starting to get a decent idea, but not the big enchilada.
[00:25:10.213 --> 00:25:14.835]  If they're not coming after me or Trump, they gotta get through me and Trump to get to you, as Trump has said a thousand times.
[00:25:15.696 --> 00:25:16.816]  And it's absolutely true.
[00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:18.837]  Everything they're doing to us, they're gonna do to you.
[00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.198]  Like Kamala Harris.
[00:25:20.398 --> 00:25:31.303]  Giant taxes and 86,000 IRS agents to just stomp on service workers and just squeeze every nickel out of them, pick them up by their ankles and just shake the change out of their pockets.
[00:25:33.964 --> 00:25:35.445]  Make the Sheriff of Nottingham blush.
[00:25:40.492 --> 00:25:41.313]  And then she's up there.
[00:25:42.654 --> 00:25:47.618]  I told you it would morph from, now she's for no tax on tips, to now it's her idea!
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:57.865]  Even though she quarterbacked getting all this stuff set up to financially rape the snot out of service workers.
[00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:00.207]  It's just, it's insane.
[00:26:00.387 --> 00:26:02.089]  Everything they say is the complete opposite.
[00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:12.078]  I mean, it's just, these are just immoral frauds, lies, have no bottom, no compass, no conscience.
[00:26:12.379 --> 00:26:15.601]  They just do whatever they want, constantly.
[00:26:15.982 --> 00:26:18.264]  And now they're starting full World War III with the Russians.
[00:26:20.486 --> 00:26:22.307]  That said, can we put the full show headline up, please?
[00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.030]  From InfoWars.com, I want to read this to you.
[00:26:31.721 --> 00:26:33.203]  Wednesday emergency broadcast.
[00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:37.790]  Trump raises alarm.
[00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:43.739]  America already under a Harris coup as Deep State uses fake polls to prop up Kamala.
[00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:47.481]  Now that's quite a statement, but it's totally true.
[00:26:48.261 --> 00:26:49.782]  I'm gonna lay it all out when we come back.
[00:26:50.263 --> 00:27:12.298]  Their strategy to steal it, they've already installed Harris, it's already a coup, Trump's starting to make a big deal about it, he needs to make an even bigger deal, and then the corporate media spins it like, oh, he knows he's already lost, and then they use these push polls and other fake polls that I've read the methodology on, where they, again, 5, 10, 15, 20 points, call registered Democrats more than Republicans,
[00:27:13.138 --> 00:27:16.722]  In their methodology, and then say, oh look, Harris is ahead of Trump five points.
[00:27:17.042 --> 00:27:19.805]  You just added 15 points to her, and then she's ahead by five?
[00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:22.487]  I mean, a two-year-old can understand this.
[00:27:26.091 --> 00:27:28.593]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:27:30.235 --> 00:27:33.238]  And they already tried to kill him, so of course they're gonna lie.
[00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:36.381]  And of course they've got illegals voting everywhere publicly.
[00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.213]  With 87 days left, so this is just absolutely insane.
[00:27:41.473 --> 00:27:42.154]  We're going to come back.
[00:27:42.234 --> 00:27:43.895]  I've got three stacks on this.
[00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:46.478]  I'm just going to nail it, nail it, nail it, nail it with the report.
[00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:57.567]  Just want to give you a little first look or prelude, a little hors d'oeuvre, and we will then get into all the other news here today and a bunch of big guests like Viva Frye and others.
[00:27:58.846 --> 00:28:00.567]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:28:00.587 --> 00:28:07.510]  Follow me on ExitRailAlexJones and check out the vaunted InfoWars at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.350]  Thank you.
[00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:13.873]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[00:28:14.574 --> 00:28:16.976]  It is the vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[00:28:17.497 --> 00:28:23.322]  Now this is a copy of Linus Pauling who won the Nobel Prize for his findings of vitamin C's formula.
[00:28:23.882 --> 00:28:31.489]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and rose hips.
[00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:33.110]  He believes that's supercharged.
[00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:35.092]  This formula is amazing.
[00:28:35.532 --> 00:28:40.597]  We've not had it for over 12 months, and now it's available back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:41.037 --> 00:28:42.359]  It is simply incredible.
[00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:46.262]  What it does for your whole body, your immune system, is next level.
[00:28:46.582 --> 00:28:51.347]  So whether you're in super good health or not in good health, everybody benefits from this formula.
[00:28:51.547 --> 00:28:54.029]  It's back in stock, discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:55.891]  Vitamin C and zinc
[00:29:00.054 --> 00:29:11.922]  Okay, let's get into it right now.
[00:29:12.403 --> 00:29:18.647]  Look, I know everybody pretty much knows this, but we need to really, in my view, humble opinion, focus on this deeply.
[00:29:19.828 --> 00:29:24.871]  And I have a blind spot because I know all this up one side and down the other, forwards, backwards.
[00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:26.720]  I know you do too.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.821]  We just kind of learn the knowledge and just move on.
[00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:31.763]  No, the general public does not know what's going on, on average.
[00:29:31.783 --> 00:29:33.003]  They know they're getting screwed.
[00:29:33.023 --> 00:29:34.624]  They're not trusting the system now.
[00:29:35.004 --> 00:29:37.826]  But that's kind of like you wake up and you smell smoke in the house.
[00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:39.267]  You don't know exactly what's going on yet.
[00:29:39.307 --> 00:29:41.928]  You're trying to put the light on and figure out what's going on.
[00:29:43.689 --> 00:29:45.050]  That's where the general public is.
[00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:46.391]  Okay?
[00:29:47.712 --> 00:29:50.974]  And we've got to show them and say, this is specifically what's happening.
[00:29:51.914 --> 00:29:58.058]  So I literally have probably 50 articles today on this, just little exhibits.
[00:29:58.098 --> 00:29:59.779]  But here's the first big one.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.561]  This came out like a week ago, but now it's a big, intense story.
[00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:10.807]  Kamala Harris is flooding millions of dollars a day in their Federal Elections Commission filings.
[00:30:11.387 --> 00:30:12.328]  We're talking $20 million a week.
[00:30:14.554 --> 00:30:26.542]  To flood Google and Yahoo and all the other big supposed news feeds with fake stories written by them that they let them run.
[00:30:28.323 --> 00:30:29.484]  Now, this is totally unethical.
[00:30:29.564 --> 00:30:30.445]  It's a total fraud.
[00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:37.950]  And they just put a little bitty note saying paid content, but then it looks like it's a news article.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:46.922]  And so you see these articles, Kamala 10 points ahead, 20 points ahead, Kamala unstoppable, Trump going insane, Trump about to give up.
[00:30:48.462 --> 00:30:51.242]  It's literally written by the Democratic Party.
[00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:58.324]  And then they also flood it with disinfo about her policies.
[00:30:58.364 --> 00:30:59.184]  Now this is important.
[00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:00.804]  She doesn't have any policies.
[00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:03.385]  She won't do press conferences or interviews.
[00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:10.112]  Because she's a puppet and they haven't formulated behind the scenes yet what all the special interests want.
[00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:15.215]  So that's why she's not saying any policies other than, oh, I'll get rid of taxes on tips.
[00:31:15.235 --> 00:31:15.575]  That's it.
[00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:19.378]  Because I had so much trashing with people and you know Trump will do it.
[00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:20.078]  So that's the difference.
[00:31:20.218 --> 00:31:21.539]  Trump says he'll do it, he'll do it.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.821]  So we've got that going on.
[00:31:25.981 --> 00:31:28.363]  And again, all you got to do is go to the
[00:31:32.912 --> 00:31:37.055]  Poll sections of any poll and look up their methodology.
[00:31:37.075 --> 00:31:37.836]  That's what it's called.
[00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:41.698]  And even in past elections, you saw it with Hillary.
[00:31:41.898 --> 00:31:43.600]  Oh, 98% chance Hillary wins.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:44.901]  99% chance Hillary wins.
[00:31:45.161 --> 00:31:46.322]  Hillary 20 points ahead.
[00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:47.462]  Hillary 18 points ahead.
[00:31:48.463 --> 00:31:59.371]  And they would go pay for the polls and have the poll written in its methodology where they would do a lot of tricks, but who they called, who they targeted, how many more Democrats they sampled, 10, 15, 20 points extra.
[00:31:59.391 --> 00:31:59.451]  Now,
[00:32:03.038 --> 00:32:04.699]  I was doing this last week with Rob Dew.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.881]  I haven't done it again this week.
[00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:06.481]  I meant to cover it.
[00:32:06.501 --> 00:32:08.923]  A lot of times I do a bunch of research, and then you just never get to it.
[00:32:08.963 --> 00:32:13.027]  But Rob and I were back in his office, and now there's no methodology.
[00:32:15.729 --> 00:32:17.711]  So used to, they would tell you the methodology.
[00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:21.054]  Now, you go to methodology, and it doesn't say.
[00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:24.827]  So it's completely fake.
[00:32:24.847 --> 00:32:31.730]  You know, it's one thing to have a little button down here you can find and crawl through a bunch of, you know, stuff in terms of service.
[00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.571]  You can find, you know, fine print with a magnifying glass how they're running a scam.
[00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:38.712]  They're not even putting that on there now.
[00:32:39.172 --> 00:32:41.573]  Total election meddling, total fraud.
[00:32:42.153 --> 00:32:44.414]  But before I get into all this, let me give you the big takeaway.
[00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:46.034]  Because again, I'm a gauge.
[00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:50.436]  Like a gauge in the bottom of your gas tank that tells you how full it is.
[00:32:51.542 --> 00:32:56.223]  Or, you know, the engine thermometer that tells you how hot your engine is.
[00:32:56.783 --> 00:33:05.325]  Because you're not a public figure, and I make this point every day because it's so important, you don't get a good gauge, as good a gauge as I get because you're not a public figure.
[00:33:06.285 --> 00:33:14.687]  So one of the fringe benefits of being a public figure, and there's a lot of negative ones, is that you actually get to find out what people think when you go around the country.
[00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:17.988]  Okay, so, again, Trump wins,
[00:33:19.082 --> 00:33:27.789]  Eight years ago, almost eight years ago, and I would shake 20 hands, on average, before somebody said, F you and your family, I hope you die, Russian agent.
[00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:30.591]  They moved on to the Sandy Hook thing, and then it moved on to that.
[00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:32.712]  Why'd you do that to those kids?
[00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:35.574]  Some people even say, why'd you kill those kids?
[00:33:35.615 --> 00:33:37.016]  That's happened in front of my family.
[00:33:39.437 --> 00:33:45.562]  But I would get, go to the mall, go to the grocery store, go to a restaurant, I'm being confronted every time.
[00:33:46.082 --> 00:33:46.443]  Every time.
[00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:50.108]  Yeah, I shake 10-15 hands, hey, waiter comes over, nice.
[00:33:50.388 --> 00:33:53.048]  But somebody walks over to the other table and says, F you and your family, I hope you die.
[00:33:54.288 --> 00:33:55.369]  And they'll dump iced tea on your head.
[00:33:56.249 --> 00:33:57.509]  And they wait for it when you go outside.
[00:33:57.529 --> 00:34:03.010]  And I'm just sitting there with my, you know, holster concealed, going, man, I hope this person doesn't pull a weapon.
[00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:08.171]  I sure don't want the trouble of defending myself, but I'll... They pull a gun or something, I'm gonna put them down.
[00:34:09.251 --> 00:34:12.132]  So... That's where we were.
[00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.252]  And then...
[00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:23.833]  Trump got persecuted so bad by the time of the last election almost four years ago, I would get yelled at every five or six times I went out.
[00:34:25.074 --> 00:34:31.698]  So I would go to the grocery store and go to the restaurants and go to church forever, go to the mall, walk down the street, go to the park.
[00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.499]  Go to Barton Springs, go to the park.
[00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:37.822]  And I almost started forgetting I had enemies.
[00:34:38.022 --> 00:34:41.365]  Before, when it's happening every day, you're watching everywhere, you're looking.
[00:34:42.025 --> 00:34:44.767]  But I'd go like a week or two, nobody was after me.
[00:34:45.028 --> 00:34:47.870]  And then all of a sudden, I'd be being berated in some grocery store or restaurant.
[00:34:49.552 --> 00:34:53.275]  Or at the tax officer, wherever I was at, or a courthouse.
[00:34:56.995 --> 00:35:09.462]  But since they stole the election from Trump, because they saw Trump so persecuted by the time they stole the election from him, I saw a decrease in attacks of 99% really.
[00:35:12.963 --> 00:35:19.867]  Then after they stole the election from Trump, I would get confronted that first year about once a month.
[00:35:21.707 --> 00:35:30.933]  And then as people saw how bad Biden was, I get confronted now, if I go out a whole bunch of places on a trip, maybe once on the trip now.
[00:35:31.453 --> 00:35:34.555]  Airports, everywhere traveling, groups of people met once.
[00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:37.337]  One time when I went to Northern California for a week.
[00:35:37.897 --> 00:35:38.578]  Covered Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:38.698 --> 00:35:39.018]  One time.
[00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:40.159]  In the airport.
[00:35:45.319 --> 00:35:47.020]  So, let that sink in.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.620]  And I'm more famous than ever.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.661]  I mean, I walk in a place, half the people go, it's Alex Jones, hey!
[00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:56.142]  I can't even get to where I'm going, I'm just signing autographs and taking photos.
[00:35:56.643 --> 00:35:57.963]  And again, it's not about, oh, I'm famous.
[00:35:58.183 --> 00:36:03.585]  It's like, telling you, because you don't know, because you're a private person, which is great.
[00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:06.406]  We are kicking ass, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:06.946 --> 00:36:08.386]  I mean, I mean, I mean.
[00:36:09.887 --> 00:36:13.688]  Last year, we went 10 months before I got confronted.
[00:36:16.144 --> 00:36:16.865]  Ten months!
[00:36:18.646 --> 00:36:24.430]  Now, back in the campaign, and Trump back, you know, there's a little more Trump derangement syndrome again, so I'm getting a little bit of it.
[00:36:25.331 --> 00:36:25.751]  A little bit.
[00:36:27.012 --> 00:36:27.772]  Maybe once a month.
[00:36:29.093 --> 00:36:35.218]  It's been a month since I got confronted in San Francisco, so in a month, I've not had one person since then confront me.
[00:36:36.118 --> 00:36:36.939]  And I go all over the place.
[00:36:36.959 --> 00:36:39.501]  And I'm very accessible and very friendly.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:37:10.687]  So, I can look at the polls being fraudulent, the fake news stories are running, and all the lies, and all the rest of it, and show you how that's happening, and you can see it for yourself, but the biggest thing is, every restaurant I went in, every gas station I went in, the airports, the rental car places, all I got, in Northern California, was love, except one guy.
[00:37:13.999 --> 00:37:14.319]  One guy.
[00:37:16.661 --> 00:37:27.469]  The Mexicans that were at the Airbnb we rented in the middle of wine areas, a couple houses up on a hill.
[00:37:31.172 --> 00:37:33.694]  They were Mexicans that were here with farm workers.
[00:37:34.454 --> 00:37:36.196]  The head Mexican was a listener.
[00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.493]  He could barely speak English, but my wife speaks Spanish, so they were having conversations.
[00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:42.554]  He was a big fan.
[00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:43.815]  His family lives in Mexico.
[00:37:43.835 --> 00:37:46.858]  He's helping us do some stuff.
[00:37:47.678 --> 00:37:50.781]  He's also the foreman, so the people that own the winery own the house.
[00:37:50.881 --> 00:37:55.385]  The toilet was clogged, and he showed me where the plunger was, and I gave him a tip or whatever.
[00:37:55.405 --> 00:37:59.908]  But the point was, is that that wasn't really his job.
[00:37:59.928 --> 00:38:00.909]  We just asked him, and he helped us.
[00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.892]  But I mean, you know,
[00:38:05.307 --> 00:38:08.089]  The Mexican that runs the vineyards a listener?
[00:38:08.229 --> 00:38:09.270]  I mean, you know, I mean, come on.
[00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.991]  And my wife's talking to him in Spanish.
[00:38:12.032 --> 00:38:15.395]  He kept coming over to me and, like, shaking my hand and saying, I like you and stuff.
[00:38:15.455 --> 00:38:16.256]  And so my wife starts talking.
[00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:17.116]  She goes, oh, he's a big listener.
[00:38:17.136 --> 00:38:17.997]  He's been listening for years.
[00:38:18.437 --> 00:38:19.778]  His family listens to you in Mexico.
[00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:21.500]  And I'm like, really?
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.340]  Ask him what I've been doing.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.181]  He goes, oh, yes.
[00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:25.723]  You know, they tried to kill Trump because he doesn't want World War III.
[00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:31.067]  My wife goes, he doesn't want World War III, honey.
[00:38:31.087 --> 00:38:31.127]  So,
[00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:37.032]  The foreman of the winery is a listener.
[00:38:37.112 --> 00:38:40.233]  I mean, so that's a reflection on Trump.
[00:38:42.694 --> 00:38:47.336]  He's, I mean, he'll probably get 70% of the people that vote.
[00:38:48.436 --> 00:38:55.239]  The problem is a lot of people aren't going to go out and they're not going to vote because they think, oh, well, it's all fraudulent.
[00:38:55.259 --> 00:38:58.440]  Yeah, but you have to override the fraud.
[00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:00.567]  Too big to rig.
[00:39:00.587 --> 00:39:04.851]  That's what all the evidence shows, and I've already gone over why that matters, but I won't belabor the facts.
[00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:06.192]  You've already heard it 50 million times.
[00:39:08.134 --> 00:39:15.361]  But they only got so many dead people to vote, folks, and people to move out of districts, okay?
[00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:16.342]  They got a limited arsenal.
[00:39:17.963 --> 00:39:22.667]  And that's why they tried to kill him, because in their real polls, they know Trump's 20 points ahead in general.
[00:39:22.687 --> 00:39:24.709]  10 points in battlegrounds.
[00:39:25.854 --> 00:39:40.105]  So now they're creating this hoax that Kamala has won already and that Trump is exposing the fact that she had a coup and the fact that she was installed.
[00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:45.829]  He's not exposing that because it's the truth and it's terrible and it's totalitarian and it's illegal.
[00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.471]  They violated all these laws.
[00:39:50.452 --> 00:39:54.075]  No, no, he's doing that because he knows they're about to beat him.
[00:39:55.737 --> 00:39:57.698]  No, he knows they're trying to steal it.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.102]  So Trump goes to any big event that aren't even his events, he gets standing ovations.
[00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:11.987]  Baseball games, football games, UFC, boxing matches, you name it.
[00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:20.453]  And then he goes in a grocery store, a bodega in Brooklyn, nothing but love.
[00:40:21.734 --> 00:40:23.375]  He goes to Harlem, nothing but love.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.522]  And then Biden goes into restaurants, and no one cares.
[00:40:30.023 --> 00:40:31.384]  And it's the same thing with Kamala.
[00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:40.729]  I mean, Trump shows up in New York City, and in five minutes, thousands of people run out to see him.
[00:40:43.371 --> 00:40:45.692]  White, black, Hispanic, and they're crying.
[00:40:47.554 --> 00:40:49.715]  Because they know he's the maverick.
[00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:51.676]  They know he's the trailblazer.
[00:40:51.716 --> 00:40:53.037]  They know he's the rebel.
[00:40:53.537 --> 00:40:54.558]  He's the cool hand Luke.
[00:40:55.748 --> 00:40:56.328]  They know.
[00:40:57.709 --> 00:40:58.729]  And they know I'm the rebel.
[00:40:59.129 --> 00:40:59.809]  I'm the outlaw.
[00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:02.190]  People know they're getting screwed.
[00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:03.710]  They know we're fighting for them.
[00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.250]  We're in this together.
[00:41:06.751 --> 00:41:09.211]  I want prosperity and security and freedom and peace.
[00:41:10.052 --> 00:41:11.212]  Globalists want the opposite.
[00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:15.073]  Like Elon Musk said, with Trump you get prosperity, with Kamala you get the opposite.
[00:41:17.148 --> 00:41:23.090]  So I can tell you, I can prove scientifically all these polls and this stuff's crap, we already know that, but I don't need to.
[00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.550]  I can go out on the street and I can see it for myself.
[00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:37.753]  In liberal Austin, or liberal San Francisco, people are sick of it.
[00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:44.395]  And it's bad enough to have the corporate media running defense and offense for Kamala,
[00:41:45.814 --> 00:41:54.516]  But now they flood thousands of articles a week that look like they're news articles and they're completely fake, written by the campaign?
[00:41:56.817 --> 00:41:59.778]  And the news reports are like, well, it's just a form of advertising, it's fine.
[00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:11.641]  And yeah, in the early days, somewhere 30 years, and I remember buying ads on Newsmax 25 years ago, because I was a guest on Newsmax a lot, and they had a salesman call me and say, hey, would you like to put an ad for your documentaries?
[00:42:11.921 --> 00:42:13.382]  And the ads did pretty good, actually.
[00:42:14.189 --> 00:42:15.550]  And I said, yeah, what type of ads do you have?
[00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.233]  Well, we can put one on the website or we can put one on our magazine.
[00:42:18.253 --> 00:42:18.974]  We can do both.
[00:42:19.394 --> 00:42:21.356]  And this was $5,000 and this was $10,000.
[00:42:22.317 --> 00:42:26.301]  But we really recommend the article where we write an article about your video.
[00:42:26.782 --> 00:42:30.285]  That's $20,000 and it's on the website and it's in the magazine.
[00:42:30.706 --> 00:42:32.868]  And I did that ad and it made some good money back.
[00:42:34.212 --> 00:42:47.602]  And I had to be interviewed, and then we wrote an article, and I signed off on it, and then I didn't do it after that because it was such a hassle to, you know, talk to their person and spend, you know, because they're slow, at least back then, you know, have them write an article about the video, and then they do a review of it, and I paid for it.
[00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:52.846]  I mean, yeah, we know there's paid promotion out there, but it says paid promotion at the bottom of the article.
[00:42:55.488 --> 00:42:56.149]  This isn't that.
[00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:59.151]  They're just flooding fake garbage everywhere.
[00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:02.337]  So let's just run through some of these headlines.
[00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:05.701]  Kamala Harris leading in five battleground states.
[00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:06.241]  Survey.
[00:43:06.862 --> 00:43:09.465]  Newsweek's no longer Newsweek Magazine, it's a PR firm.
[00:43:09.725 --> 00:43:10.105]  Paid for.
[00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:12.067]  Flashback.
[00:43:12.128 --> 00:43:16.452]  Nikki Haley predicted Kamala Harris would be elected if President Trump won GP nomination.
[00:43:18.074 --> 00:43:20.136]  Harris surprising Rust Belt strength.
[00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:22.919]  Axios, total Democrat party mouthpiece.
[00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:34.739]  As Kamala Harris' lead widens, some Republicans tell Andrew Neil they now fear Trump's age and increasingly deranged behavior means he's on track to lose the election and could even be at risk of a breakdown.
[00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:38.142]  You see that talking point everywhere.
[00:43:38.422 --> 00:43:40.364]  It's pulled out of their rear ends.
[00:43:40.984 --> 00:43:43.526]  Just like Alex Jones pees on dead kids' graves.
[00:43:43.626 --> 00:43:43.866]  Really.
[00:43:43.886 --> 00:43:45.748]  Never been to their graves.
[00:43:46.248 --> 00:43:47.069]  Nobody peed in their graves.
[00:43:50.538 --> 00:43:53.701]  Former Trump aide claimed Donald is in meltdown.
[00:43:54.222 --> 00:43:55.683]  Feels the election's slipping from him.
[00:43:56.084 --> 00:43:59.107]  So he's lighting up the campaign because of a terrible decision.
[00:44:00.568 --> 00:44:02.811]  Trump needs someone to tell him the truth.
[00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:03.952]  He's losing the hill.
[00:44:05.293 --> 00:44:09.137]  Harris, Trump head to North Carolina as battleground map widens.
[00:44:11.379 --> 00:44:13.421]  And they put out all these fake polls.
[00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:15.449]  But then you get something like this.
[00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:20.510]  Resentful Joe Biden set to snub Barack Obama at Kamala Harris speeches at DNC.
[00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:27.491]  And he is, because he even said, he even told CBS News, yeah, they basically removed me.
[00:44:28.411 --> 00:44:31.612]  Well, you let them do that when he had his medical emergency for a week.
[00:44:32.992 --> 00:44:34.393]  We said, oh, looks like they've grabbed him.
[00:44:34.593 --> 00:44:35.353]  They've drugged him up.
[00:44:35.533 --> 00:44:36.413]  They put out a fake letter.
[00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:37.693]  It's all admitted now!
[00:44:37.893 --> 00:44:39.233]  A real coup!
[00:44:40.934 --> 00:44:41.654]  I mean, wow!
[00:44:42.904 --> 00:44:48.809]  And then Trump talks about that, and they spin it like he's evil and he's bad.
[00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.932]  Oh, he knows he's gonna lose!
[00:44:52.992 --> 00:44:58.075]  That's why—no, he's up against a candidate they installed who never had one vote in the primaries.
[00:44:58.116 --> 00:44:58.916]  That's illegal!
[00:44:59.817 --> 00:45:00.377]  On record!
[00:45:01.518 --> 00:45:03.500]  Her taking over Biden's money is illegal!
[00:45:07.803 --> 00:45:10.345]  And these are—the meaning behind Trump's ill-fitting suits.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:17.985]  No, that's the style of chief executive from, like, the 60s and 70s, is to wear a comfortable, loose-fitting suit.
[00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:21.548]  The chief executive doesn't wear skinny jeans.
[00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.232]  That's an old-school outfit.
[00:45:26.972 --> 00:45:27.533]  It's comfortable.
[00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:29.014]  He works in it 18 hours a day.
[00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:32.597]  Oh, he's a weirdo!
[00:45:32.677 --> 00:45:34.178]  Oh, he just shoots loose.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.163]  What do you want to wear him, like, you know, leather pants and high heels like Zelensky?
[00:45:41.727 --> 00:45:42.867]  Elon plus Trump.
[00:45:43.568 --> 00:45:44.468]  Best friends forever.
[00:45:44.748 --> 00:45:46.068]  The billionaire boys club.
[00:45:46.409 --> 00:45:48.529]  Fox populist tongue bath.
[00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.591]  Musk X using far-right hate to promote ads.
[00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:54.511]  I mean, it's just all crap.
[00:45:54.531 --> 00:45:54.831]  Look at this.
[00:45:55.011 --> 00:45:56.032]  Trump sues America.
[00:45:56.052 --> 00:45:59.613]  You mean he sues the DOJ for wrongfully raiding Mar-a-Lago?
[00:46:00.754 --> 00:46:01.895]  Oh, he sued you, see?
[00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:03.495]  Everything is crap.
[00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:04.916]  Everything is lies.
[00:46:05.176 --> 00:46:09.759]  And then they have the fallback of, oh wait, don't count Trump completely out yet.
[00:46:10.199 --> 00:46:12.100]  CNN said he might still have a chance.
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.462]  So it makes it sound more reasonable, like, oh, she's way ahead, but he could still be there.
[00:46:16.943 --> 00:46:18.183]  Oh, still keep watching.
[00:46:18.203 --> 00:46:19.344]  There's a little bit of a chance.
[00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:23.526]  When he is light years ahead of her in popularity.
[00:46:24.507 --> 00:46:26.508]  From the real numbers and what I see on the street.
[00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:28.729]  Anti-Trump pollster.
[00:46:29.861 --> 00:46:35.385]  Frank Luntz stuns CNN panel, admits Trump is winning over union workers like no Republican in decades.
[00:46:35.405 --> 00:46:41.989]  Yeah, the majority of union workers are saying they're going to vote for Trump when they do local polls, but then magically he's getting less numbers.
[00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.971]  Oh, triple the number of blacks are going to vote for Trump, but he's losing the blacks.
[00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:48.993]  Triple the number of Hispanics, but he's going to lose.
[00:46:49.033 --> 00:46:54.717]  See, all the real research shows the opposite, a landslide, but when you tune into the corporate media, oh no, he's losing.
[00:46:54.777 --> 00:46:55.738]  He's a terrible person.
[00:46:57.418 --> 00:46:57.958]  Here's more of it.
[00:46:58.539 --> 00:47:04.563]  Harris campaign caught editing Google search ads to make it look like major news outlets support her.
[00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:06.844]  And they let them do it, and they pay to do it.
[00:47:08.786 --> 00:47:09.606]  And the media expends it.
[00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:13.909]  You know, Axios, well, Harris sponsored Google ads, suggests publishers are on her side, oh yeah.
[00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.032]  Suggests that, it makes it look like they're openly, you know, supporting her.
[00:47:18.232 --> 00:47:20.834]  Which they already are anyways, but these are even more ridiculously over the top.
[00:47:21.615 --> 00:47:24.777]  Kamala Harris campaign sponsored Google ads modifying news headlines.
[00:47:26.255 --> 00:47:26.755]  USA Today.
[00:47:27.275 --> 00:47:27.956]  Modifying, yeah.
[00:47:28.116 --> 00:47:32.397]  You go to get the news, you get a bunch of stuff that says it's news, paid for by the Democratic Party.
[00:47:32.598 --> 00:47:34.058]  They've removed any pretense.
[00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:44.162]  And all these prominent influencers are saying they've been contacted by the DNC to promote Kamala, but they gotta sign an NDA before they get the money.
[00:47:46.183 --> 00:47:47.603]  Yeah, it's AstroTurf.
[00:47:47.703 --> 00:47:48.804]  It's paid for.
[00:47:55.925 --> 00:47:56.925]  Cope and Seethe.
[00:47:57.065 --> 00:47:58.406]  MSM demonizes Trump.
[00:47:59.426 --> 00:48:01.907]  Musk interview with wall-to-wall negative headlines.
[00:48:02.307 --> 00:48:03.027]  Still ongoing.
[00:48:04.027 --> 00:48:04.647]  Here's CNN.
[00:48:04.888 --> 00:48:06.268]  Trump's still very much in this.
[00:48:06.348 --> 00:48:09.249]  CNN analyst dampens dim Kamala hopes.
[00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:20.832]  It's like Cassius Clay in his first big fight when he knocks out Sonny Liston and the guy he just knocks out is on the ground.
[00:48:20.852 --> 00:48:22.953]  They're like, well, Muhammad Ali is still in this.
[00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:23.593]  Okay.
[00:48:25.868 --> 00:48:27.489]  It's like after Tom Brady would win a Super Bowl.
[00:48:27.789 --> 00:48:29.650]  Well, Tom Brady, you know, still in it.
[00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.351]  Oh, yeah, he's still in it, all right.
[00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:33.392]  Not in it now.
[00:48:36.294 --> 00:48:39.455]  So, that's just some of the news we've got there.
[00:48:39.475 --> 00:48:41.676]  I'm going to start the next hour.
[00:48:41.916 --> 00:48:44.358]  Great researcher, really smart cookie.

[00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:55.617]  He's got a lot to cover.
[00:48:55.637 --> 00:49:01.700]  He's really been focusing in on this Harris coup and all these top globalist minions saying they're going to have martial law and civil war.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.700]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:07.902]  We've got all the news out of Russia.
[00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:08.703]  That's just so horrible.
[00:49:08.743 --> 00:49:09.283]  I can't even believe it.
[00:49:09.303 --> 00:49:09.963]  We're going to go to break.
[00:49:10.423 --> 00:49:11.744]  Come back with all that next hour.
[00:49:12.824 --> 00:49:13.945]  Remember, you're the Paul Reveres.

[00:52:01.723 --> 00:52:03.905]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:10.172]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:52:11.218 --> 00:52:19.781]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:52:20.122 --> 00:52:21.982]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:27.104]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:52:27.825 --> 00:52:33.507]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:52:33.887 --> 00:52:36.388]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:38.729]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:52:39.946 --> 00:52:55.957]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:52:56.317 --> 00:53:03.002]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:53:04.142 --> 00:53:14.969]  Our products and a lot of the products that we developed, but so many of these products that they had put out again were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:53:15.982 --> 00:53:24.084]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:53:24.164 --> 00:53:30.786]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:53:30.947 --> 00:53:33.447]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:53:33.607 --> 00:53:35.568]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:53:35.748 --> 00:53:45.471]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:53:46.131 --> 00:53:48.533]  So that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:53:48.593 --> 00:53:50.114]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:53:51.315 --> 00:53:58.039]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:53:58.159 --> 00:54:03.823]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:54:03.923 --> 00:54:12.449]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWars.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:14.571]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:29.464]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:54:29.964 --> 00:54:34.345]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:54:34.405 --> 00:54:39.066]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:54:40.086 --> 00:54:45.309]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:46.010]  It's amazing.
[00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:47.070]  It's super high quality.
[00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.011]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:49.792]  Nitric Boost.
[00:54:49.952 --> 00:54:50.672]  Good night's sleep.
[00:54:50.892 --> 00:54:52.433]  Joint Relief Max is amazing.
[00:54:52.533 --> 00:54:53.814]  Nerve Renew Prostate Support.
[00:54:53.874 --> 00:54:54.894]  Probiotic Formula.
[00:54:55.015 --> 00:54:56.535]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:54:56.815 --> 00:54:57.916]  25 milligram gummies.
[00:54:58.056 --> 00:54:59.217]  CBD Full Spectrum.
[00:54:59.437 --> 00:55:00.257]  10 milligram gummies.
[00:55:00.277 --> 00:55:00.838]  Works great.
[00:55:00.878 --> 00:55:01.878]  Turmeric 95.
[00:55:02.038 --> 00:55:03.199]  Libido RX.
[00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:03.979]  Better Mood.
[00:55:04.139 --> 00:55:07.561]  Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system.
[00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:08.642]  Superfood Greens.
[00:55:08.902 --> 00:55:09.262]  Thank you.
[00:55:45.074 --> 00:55:45.936]  Do you believe the Olympics?
[00:55:45.956 --> 00:55:48.420]  Do they have the chance of becoming maybe a super spreader?
[00:55:48.741 --> 00:55:50.424]  I think that's a... For sure!
[00:55:50.444 --> 00:55:50.424]  1,000%!
[00:55:50.665 --> 00:55:51.346]  Lordy lordy!
[00:55:57.008 --> 00:56:01.413]  Buckle up, buckaroo, because it's on like Donkey Kong.
[00:56:01.713 --> 00:56:02.154]  Look at this.
[00:56:02.494 --> 00:56:08.120]  Peter Hotez, the mini-me of Fauci, calls for police deployment against anti-vaxxers.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.101]  It's worse than that.
[00:56:09.542 --> 00:56:16.609]  UN and NATO troops to take over the media, lockdown, martial law, and force inject you under the UN treaty.
[00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:17.650]  What?
[00:56:18.547 --> 00:56:26.503]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:56:26.543 --> 00:56:27.906]  We're going to have to bring in
[00:56:29.304 --> 00:56:34.830]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:47.483]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[00:56:47.523 --> 00:56:50.045]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[00:56:50.766 --> 00:56:58.974]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[00:56:58.994 --> 00:57:00.015]  200,000 Americans died.
[00:57:02.284 --> 00:57:04.305]  Because of anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:05.726]  Anti-science aggression.
[00:57:05.746 --> 00:57:05.866]  Liar.
[00:57:05.986 --> 00:57:09.148]  Well that makes you and me, my friend, aggressors.
[00:57:09.528 --> 00:57:12.169]  Anti-science and anti-vaccine aggressors.
[00:57:12.489 --> 00:57:14.470]  So who's being aggressed?
[00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:16.071]  We're creating victims.
[00:57:16.952 --> 00:57:21.914]  He's claiming that we've killed 200,000 people through our anti-science aggression.
[00:57:22.374 --> 00:57:23.455]  That makes us murderers.
[00:57:23.755 --> 00:57:27.197]  This is a brilliant rhetorical tactic to deflect from the fact that
[00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:29.981]  I'm saying that they're murderers, right?
[00:57:30.001 --> 00:57:33.526]  That they created a mass murder through these injections.
[00:57:33.726 --> 00:57:36.430]  It was known already in 2007-2008 from analysis of the SARS-CoV-1.
[00:57:39.175 --> 00:57:42.236]  The problem is the disinformation empire is so vast and pervasive and that until
[00:58:03.723 --> 00:58:10.506]  We do something more definitive to get to the source of the disinformation and stop it.
[00:58:11.066 --> 00:58:12.687]  It's not going to have that much of an impact.
[00:58:12.807 --> 00:58:18.029]  We did a rigorous review of these autopsies and we found that about 74% of the cases of sudden death
[00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.951]  ...were caused or contributed to by the vaccine.
[00:58:23.331 --> 00:58:26.153]  That is now a peer-reviewed paper that's going to be published.
[00:58:26.593 --> 00:58:32.836]  And the reason I'm telling you that is that there is more evidence coming every single day.
[00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:35.337]  And it's not a little bit of evidence.
[00:58:35.397 --> 00:58:48.343]  It's not a case report here that they're going to dismiss, or a case report there, or a paper that the Lancet is going to take down and say, don't look at this autopsy series, and we'll just bury it and make sure it never sees the light of day.
[00:58:48.843 --> 00:59:03.199]  There's going to be a tsunami of evidence of the harm of these COVID-19 vaccines, whether it's harming children, pregnant women, adults, and my message to the politicians is get ahead of this.
[00:59:04.261 --> 00:59:05.822]  Get ahead of this if you can.
[00:59:05.962 --> 00:59:12.948]  Don't chase after when all the evidence is out and then you're caught with your pants down.
[00:59:12.968 --> 00:59:15.270]  They're treating you.
[00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:18.713]  Your functioning is the useful idiots of the anti-vaccine world.
[00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:20.054]  Why are you calling people names?
[00:59:20.074 --> 00:59:20.754]  Do you know me?
[00:59:20.774 --> 00:59:21.615]  Who do I associate with?
[00:59:21.675 --> 00:59:25.058]  How do you know I associate with idiots or listen to idiots?
[00:59:25.098 --> 00:59:26.839]  You're making an unfounded assumption.
[00:59:26.859 --> 00:59:27.660]  You're being duped.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.923]  No, the CDC documentation is scary to me.
[00:59:31.143 --> 00:59:33.845]  I want you to hear my side so that you know it's not just us.
[00:59:34.285 --> 00:59:39.434]  The memos have now come out that, like, Trudeau was told was killing everybody to cover it up.
[00:59:39.494 --> 00:59:43.120]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:46.626]  We need totalitarian powers to lock people up wherever we want.
[00:59:47.699 --> 00:59:49.180]  And they're gearing up the bird flu.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.862]  They've got their new mRNA shot ready.
[00:59:51.322 --> 00:59:54.245]  It's all happening right now.
[00:59:54.906 --> 00:59:59.650]  In an article citing cases involving crimes towards scientists, Hotez, in part, writes, quote,
[01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.597]  Three months later, I'm hanging out with someone.
[01:00:08.697 --> 01:00:11.358]  My entire left side of my face starts to err, starts to droop.
[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.920]  They're like, okay, time to go back to the hospital.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.901]  I'm like, no, no, it's just anxiety, don't you worry.
[01:00:17.622 --> 01:00:20.003]  But sadly, not anxiety, it was a stroke.
[01:00:20.223 --> 01:00:26.526]  And I had been having strokes, apparently, because my internal carotid arteries were closing up to be this teeny tiny small.
[01:00:26.926 --> 01:00:28.807]  Can this get any more naked?
[01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:32.209]  Can this get any more?
[01:00:37.924 --> 01:00:40.527]  Alright, always love getting Aviva Frye on.
[01:00:40.587 --> 01:00:47.734]  He is a recovering lawyer, as he says, a very popular talk show host, and a friend, and he's always on fire.
[01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:58.104]  But he's been knocking it out of the park, exposing the attempted assassination of Trump, the installation of Kamala Harris,
[01:00:59.437 --> 01:01:08.805]  Different globalists admitting there was a coup, admitting that they want to have civil war if Trump is re-elected.
[01:01:10.206 --> 01:01:15.190]  Just all of it is so incredibly dangerous and insane.
[01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:25.519]  And now we've got, for a week, this huge incursion up to 60 miles into Russia with NATO mercenaries and frontline NATO equipment.
[01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:29.543]  And a spiraling out of control escalation.
[01:01:29.563 --> 01:01:35.528]  We'll talk about Elon Musk, electronic voting machines, Tim Walz, Stolen Valor, Kamala Harris.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.422]  And so much more with Viva Fry.
[01:01:39.902 --> 01:01:45.167]  Find him on Viva, the Viva Fry on X and VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[01:01:45.747 --> 01:01:49.610]  And we really appreciate him, him joining us.
[01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:57.216]  I want to go wherever you want to go, but front and center, because you've been covering it, so have I. And unfortunately, a lot of other folks really haven't.
[01:01:57.256 --> 01:02:04.942]  It's a big deal to have Congressman Raskin and Biden and a whole bunch of others saying, if Trump wins, we're going to have a civil war.
[01:02:05.783 --> 01:02:07.027]  And we're not going to accept it.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.493]  It's just absolutely crazy.
[01:02:09.534 --> 01:02:11.198]  In fact, here's a short clip.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.842]  You confident?
[01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:18.163]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[01:02:18.923 --> 01:02:22.106]  If Trump wins, no, I'm not confident at all.
[01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:30.814]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[01:02:30.854 --> 01:02:34.978]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war conditions.
[01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.060]  OK, so.
[01:02:38.314 --> 01:02:40.175]  Big picture, 35,000 foot view.
[01:02:40.195 --> 01:02:41.756]  31 days ago, they tried to kill Trump.
[01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:43.857]  They tried to imply that was fake.
[01:02:43.898 --> 01:02:45.038]  You can't fake something like that.
[01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.140]  Real people got wounded and died.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.261]  And then now the total stand down.
[01:02:49.401 --> 01:02:54.744]  I mean, and they want us just to move on like it was the last Netflix show, the last Avengers movie.
[01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.205]  No, this isn't a movie.
[01:02:56.245 --> 01:02:57.146]  This isn't Dune.
[01:02:57.646 --> 01:03:01.368]  This is the real world with them installing Kamala illegally.
[01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:03.870]  Give us your take on just the big picture.
[01:03:05.267 --> 01:03:14.313]  Just to cover my own butt, Joe Biden, in all of his mental acuity and cogentness, misspoke and corrected himself and said, no, no, I didn't mean if Trump gets elected.
[01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:18.856]  I meant if Trump doesn't get elected, we can't promise that there won't be violence.
[01:03:19.357 --> 01:03:20.778]  What Jamie Raskin said
[01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:24.323]  Should be sufficient to get him out of office permanently.
[01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:26.526]  There should be sanctions, whatever the heck you have to do.
[01:03:27.027 --> 01:03:31.354]  Jamie Raskin did nothing other than say, we've tried to remove him from the ballot.
[01:03:31.715 --> 01:03:32.876]  We've tried to bankrupt him.
[01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:34.299]  We've now tried to kill him.
[01:03:34.679 --> 01:03:36.242]  And if he manages to win the election,
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.584]  We're just going to go back and try to go with the 14th Amendment, subparagraph 3, disqualification.
[01:03:41.844 --> 01:03:51.771]  And we're going to have to tell the mob of people, sorry, democracy is over because we've just disqualified your guy after we couldn't disqualify him from the ballots, after we couldn't bankrupt him, lock him up, or kill him.
[01:03:52.372 --> 01:03:54.533]  If he gets elected, we're just going to disqualify him.
[01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.796]  He should be censured and removed from office.
[01:03:58.236 --> 01:04:02.680]  But what's amazing is, yeah, they want you to just move on and pretend that four weeks ago,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.165]  The Secret Service did not allow, because I firmly believe that they did allow for this to happen.
[01:04:08.505 --> 01:04:11.908]  It's not just, you know, deliberate incompetence.
[01:04:12.468 --> 01:04:26.381]  When we find out now that this the shooter Crooks guy had been training 43 days over the last year, some days on Christmas, Valentine's Day, Halloween, at a shooting range in Pennsylvania, where Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement were training.
[01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:29.703]  I mean, the kid obviously looks like he had an issue.
[01:04:29.743 --> 01:04:31.425]  He looked like he was not mentally all there.
[01:04:31.645 --> 01:04:36.228]  You see a kid like that training 43 times in a year and that doesn't raise any flags to law enforcement?
[01:04:36.548 --> 01:04:36.989]  I don't believe it.
[01:04:37.009 --> 01:04:43.113]  And then he's wandering around for 90 minutes with a rangefinder and 26 minutes on the roof and you can see him crawling along the top.
[01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:45.335]  I mean, this is a total stand down.
[01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:51.020]  You could not have that much incompetence in a row in the first place.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:57.482]  I make the analogy that in a minority report, you know, when they had an orgy of evidence and the guy says, you know how often you see an orgy of evidence?
[01:04:57.722 --> 01:04:57.963]  Never.
[01:04:58.243 --> 01:04:59.903]  This is an orgy of incompetence.
[01:05:00.103 --> 01:05:01.084]  You know how often you see that?
[01:05:01.504 --> 01:05:01.764]  Never.
[01:05:02.224 --> 01:05:07.346]  And by the way, top Green Beret sniper commanders, members of Congress that are Green Berets,
[01:05:08.787 --> 01:05:19.417]  I mean, I've had like at least eight or nine of them on the show, including the top sniper in the world shot somebody at 2.2 miles in Iraq on video with a .50 cal.
[01:05:20.198 --> 01:05:28.766]  They said, all of them said it's perfect incompetence over and over again at hundreds of points, which is impossible coincidentally.
[01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:30.488]  It's absolutely clear.
[01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:33.470]  It's called fractal wrongness.
[01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:34.670]  It can't happen by accident.
[01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:38.072]  And it's not just that it all happened, and I don't think it was by accident.
[01:05:38.592 --> 01:05:41.913]  The explanations that they gave were mutually incompatible.
[01:05:41.993 --> 01:05:43.534]  Why wasn't there anyone on the roof?
[01:05:43.574 --> 01:05:48.596]  Well, Kim Cheadle, the now-resigned disgraced Kim Cheadle, who probably, you know, she'll get a million-dollar payday like Peter Stroke did.
[01:05:49.016 --> 01:05:49.736]  Why weren't they on the roof?
[01:05:49.957 --> 01:05:50.717]  It was too slow.
[01:05:51.097 --> 01:05:52.077]  Oh, that wasn't true.
[01:05:52.117 --> 01:05:52.938]  Why weren't they on the roof?
[01:05:53.298 --> 01:05:57.039]  Because they didn't need to, because they had a visual of the roof by the other snipers elsewhere.
[01:05:57.259 --> 01:05:58.480]  Oh, they didn't have a visual of the roof?
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.621]  None of it makes any sense.
[01:06:00.661 --> 01:06:09.607]  And then Ronald Rowe, the guy that was actually in charge, testified he didn't know who basically pulled things off, and it turned out he specifically pulled the people off.
[01:06:11.292 --> 01:06:13.934]  Alex, it's obvious that it was deliberate.
[01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:15.795]  I'm not even going to let it happen on purpose.
[01:06:15.815 --> 01:06:17.176]  This is a made it happen on purpose.
[01:06:17.436 --> 01:06:20.858]  That's my personal view, but there's no other conclusion to draw from this evidence.
[01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.059]  But why isn't the media talking about it?
[01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:31.484]  I mean, we are in a community where everybody knows of Operation Mockingbird, how intelligence assets infiltrated the media to control the narrative throughout history.
[01:06:31.964 --> 01:06:33.445]  Why isn't the media talking about it?
[01:06:33.786 --> 01:06:41.472]  Because there's just an extension of Operation Mockingbird 2.0 where you're not going to have the intelligence assets in the media shining the light on the attempted coup.
[01:06:41.532 --> 01:06:46.496]  It was the final hurrah, the last culmination of their attempt to remove Trump from the ballot.
[01:06:46.716 --> 01:06:48.277]  They couldn't do it democratically.
[01:06:48.518 --> 01:06:52.020]  They couldn't do it lawfare-wise in terms of removing him from the ballot.
[01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.061]  They couldn't lock him up.
[01:06:53.241 --> 01:06:54.883]  They couldn't get him in Florida, D.C., whatever.
[01:06:55.263 --> 01:06:57.325]  So they literally tried to have him killed by a kid who
[01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:03.093]  You notice that answer from, I forget who it was, whether or not the FBI knew of Crooks.
[01:07:03.533 --> 01:07:09.377]  And they said, he wasn't in our holdings, which is a very bizarre response to, had you ever come across him?
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:10.197]  Did you ever see this guy?
[01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:12.539]  Well, he wasn't in our holdings doesn't answer the question.
[01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:16.481]  And now that we know, because of the recent disclosures, which the media is not running with,
[01:07:17.139 --> 01:07:25.728]  That this kid was training for an entire year at a place, at a shooting range that is sufficiently professional, that has got law enforcement professionals training there.
[01:07:26.148 --> 01:07:27.309]  A kid who looks like a loner.
[01:07:27.369 --> 01:07:30.412]  He looks like your poster child for mass shooters.
[01:07:31.372 --> 01:07:34.494]  Let's just be clear, because I looked into it, even Fox News covered it.
[01:07:35.015 --> 01:07:37.236]  It's their main designated training center.
[01:07:37.276 --> 01:07:40.539]  It's not just a place where they have an account to shoot there.
[01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:45.082]  It's their federal law enforcement training facility that other people can train at as well.
[01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:47.924]  And of course, I predicted that would be the case.
[01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.346]  So where do you see this going?
[01:07:51.804 --> 01:07:56.708]  I look, I have some very dark thoughts and I don't even like putting that juju out in the universe.
[01:07:57.749 --> 01:08:03.533]  What we've had was a parading of Secret Service incompetence for the entire world to see.
[01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:10.278]  What's Iran thinking when they say, oh yeah, we had threats on Trump and this is the security that they had knowing that we were threatening Trump's life?
[01:08:10.718 --> 01:08:19.787]  What you had was basically an open invitation to bad players celebrating the incompetence, if you want to call it that, but I would say the corruption of the Secret Service.
[01:08:20.207 --> 01:08:23.350]  And there are no limits or depths to the depravity.
[01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.451]  So where does it go?
[01:08:24.551 --> 01:08:24.891]  I don't know.
[01:08:24.911 --> 01:08:26.333]  I hope Trump is taking
[01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:30.462]  Beyond proper precautions, because I don't trust the Secret Service.
[01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:31.983]  I wouldn't trust, I don't trust the FBI.
[01:08:32.023 --> 01:08:33.224]  I think they're complicit in all of this.
[01:08:33.745 --> 01:08:34.445]  Where do I see it going?
[01:08:35.466 --> 01:08:37.948]  They are basically telling you we can do whatever we want.
[01:08:38.409 --> 01:08:41.692]  There are no repercussions, there are no consequences, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.994]  So I take the Bongino approach.
[01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:52.502]  Get people out, get people voting, because this will be resolved on November, I don't want to get the date wrong, but November 5th at the election.
[01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:53.443]  No, I totally agree.
[01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:55.845]  And of course, Tucker did this six months ago, a year ago.
[01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.345]  I did it as well.
[01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.786]  We basically have the same view.
[01:08:57.806 --> 01:08:58.587]  I said the same thing.
[01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:06.453]  I said impeachment and Russiagate and all the frauds and the lawfare and the criminal charges and the fake conviction and none of it works.
[01:09:21.465 --> 01:09:25.449]  And so next on the trajectory is assassination, and then that fails.
[01:09:25.549 --> 01:09:26.450]  So what's next?
[01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.111]  Attempted assassination again?
[01:09:29.552 --> 01:09:30.373]  Black Swan events?
[01:09:30.393 --> 01:09:33.896]  I mean, what do you think this desperate deep state is going to do right now?
[01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:39.201]  Well, and I say this like, you know, you can predict scoundrel behavior by thinking like scoundrels.
[01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:43.184]  And once you've seen how scoundrels think, what they want to do is what they did in 2020.
[01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:48.889]  Control the method of voting, because that was the only way they could sufficiently fortify the 2020 election.
[01:09:50.281 --> 01:09:54.574]  You can't do it necessarily through a pandemic again because I think people have gotten too wise to that.
[01:09:55.357 --> 01:10:04.822]  When you look at what's going on in Europe and the violence in the streets, that is the culmination of decades of terrible, terrible open border immigration policy.
[01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:10.104]  And then you have violence on the street, which is a backlash to the consequences of the terrible policy.
[01:10:10.425 --> 01:10:21.210]  And then you have a cracking down, not on the consequences of the bad policy, but on the people who are reacting to the stabbings, to the murders, to British citizens being treated like second class citizens, to
[01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:29.613]  His connection went out there.
[01:10:30.213 --> 01:10:37.376]  We're going to reconnect with him right now, making really, really great points.
[01:10:38.076 --> 01:10:49.040]  While we're reconnecting with Viva Frye, we're going to play a clip that I was just mentioning of Tucker Carlson six months before they tried to kill Trump.
[01:10:51.092 --> 01:10:51.592]  Predicting it.
[01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:52.212]  Here it is.
[01:10:53.253 --> 01:10:54.153]  They called him names.
[01:10:54.853 --> 01:10:55.694]  He won anyway.
[01:10:55.934 --> 01:10:59.155]  They impeached him twice on ridiculous pretenses.
[01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:06.598]  They fabricated a lot about what happened on January 6th in order to impeach him again.
[01:11:06.698 --> 01:11:07.258]  It didn't work.
[01:11:07.818 --> 01:11:08.538]  He came back.
[01:11:09.038 --> 01:11:09.879]  Then they indicted him.
[01:11:10.319 --> 01:11:10.859]  It didn't work.
[01:11:10.879 --> 01:11:12.560]  He became more popular.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.668]  Then they indicted him three more times, and every single time his popularity rose.
[01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:24.881]  So if you begin with criticism, then you go to protest, then you go to impeachment, now you go to indictment, and none of them work, what's next?
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.660]  I mean, you know, graph it out, man!
[01:11:28.521 --> 01:11:35.642]  We're speeding toward assassination, obviously, and no one will say that, but I don't know how you can't reach that conclusion.
[01:11:36.322 --> 01:11:37.022]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:37.122 --> 01:11:46.284]  Like, they have decided, Permanent Washington, both parties have decided that there's something about Trump that's so threatening to them, they just can't have him.
[01:11:46.924 --> 01:11:48.544]  So, Viva Frye, we got your connection back.
[01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:50.124]  You were answering the question, but you got cut off.
[01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:52.645]  The miracle of technology, but it's not perfect, obviously.
[01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:54.225]  We're very thankful for it, and thankful for you.
[01:11:55.362 --> 01:11:57.685]  Graphing it out now, failed assassination attempt.
[01:11:58.286 --> 01:11:59.147]  What comes next here?
[01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:01.910]  This is not, you know, hard to know.
[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:03.613]  They're going to try something else, but what do you think it's going to be?
[01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:20.643]  Well, if I had to think like a scoundrel, I don't remember where we got cut off, but if I had to think like a scoundrel, what they noticed after the failed assassination attempt on Trump was an immediate spike in his popularity and almost heroic rise, not just nationally, but internationally.
[01:12:20.663 --> 01:12:24.525]  You know, they were making anime cartoons about Trump dodging the bullet.
[01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:31.029]  And when you see the sympathy and the public outcry in response to a failed assassination attempt,
[01:12:32.351 --> 01:12:33.992]  They can play that game.
[01:12:34.032 --> 01:12:38.957]  They can play that game on what they know to be a wildly unpopular candidate that they have currently.
[01:12:39.518 --> 01:12:41.179]  They can play an assassination.
[01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:56.134]  Now that they've just broadcast to the world how utterly useless the Secret Service is, they've basically, as far as I'm concerned, exposed Kamala Harris to something that they can then try to pin on an act of reprisal from the right who are angry at the attempted assassination on Trump.
[01:12:56.654 --> 01:13:00.138]  There's no depth to which they will not stoop.
[01:13:00.618 --> 01:13:06.764]  And that would, if I'm thinking really cynically, and I hate putting this in the universe, Kamala is wildly unpopular.
[01:13:07.145 --> 01:13:08.967]  You could get a sympathy vote.
[01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:15.753]  You could impose martial law and say, well, now we can't even have elections anymore, at least in person, because of the risk of terrorism at polling stations.
[01:13:15.954 --> 01:13:17.255]  So all digital voting.
[01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:19.352]  No, I totally agree.
[01:13:19.432 --> 01:13:23.295]  I don't think... I said, you know, they would do a medical emergency or get rid of Biden or kill him.
[01:13:23.535 --> 01:13:24.316]  They did the medical emergency.
[01:13:24.376 --> 01:13:26.777]  I said they would blame Iran and say they're gonna try to kill Trump.
[01:13:26.817 --> 01:13:31.081]  Now they're officially saying today they think Iran is currently trying to kill Trump as a cover story.
[01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:33.682]  But yeah, if I was a globalist, I'm not calling for this.
[01:13:33.703 --> 01:13:34.603]  I'm just thinking like them.
[01:13:35.224 --> 01:13:39.507]  They would kill Kamala and create a sympathy vote and then use that for martial law.
[01:13:41.263 --> 01:13:45.405]  And replace her with someone who's not known to be detestable and detested.
[01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:49.028]  I don't know if Michelle Obama, you know, people say she doesn't want to get into politics.
[01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:55.552]  I don't think the deep state leaves the choice to the people who have benefited from the deep state modus operandi.
[01:13:55.572 --> 01:13:58.694]  But it's really dark and sinister to think about what they would do.
[01:13:58.754 --> 01:14:05.739]  But everything they've done up to now, including the assassination attempt, has only increased Trump's popularity.
[01:14:05.759 --> 01:14:10.022]  So after the assassination attempt, knowing the degree to which it's enhanced his brand,
[01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:13.585]  They've got to censor the image on Facebook, calling it an altered image.
[01:14:13.845 --> 01:14:17.709]  They've got to suppress the search results on Google so that people can't even know about it.
[01:14:17.969 --> 01:14:21.352]  And a month later, instead of talking about it, they've suppressed the entire story.
[01:14:22.514 --> 01:14:26.137]  They're still talking about the JFK assassination 60 years later.
[01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:27.118]  Is it 60 years?
[01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:28.119]  Yes, 60 years later.
[01:14:28.712 --> 01:14:33.574]  The only thing that makes this different than JFK's assassination is that Trump didn't die.
[01:14:34.194 --> 01:14:38.895]  The treatment, the disparate treatment, is inconceivable and unimaginable.
[01:14:39.515 --> 01:14:41.656]  And they need to not just be talking about this.
[01:14:41.696 --> 01:14:48.098]  This needs to be front page story until people are arrested for the dereliction of duty that allowed that to happen.
[01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:52.220]  But the bottom line, they want to control the voting the way they did in 2020.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.560]  Can't allow a pandemic to do it.
[01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:55.724]  Chaos at the polling stations.
[01:14:56.265 --> 01:15:02.607]  And I can see the very dark way of doing that, especially now that they have just given the green light to every bad actor on Earth.
[01:15:02.907 --> 01:15:06.168]  Secret Service is so incompetent, they don't secure the roof.
[01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:08.608]  Secret Service is so incompetent, they don't get bathrooms.
[01:15:08.648 --> 01:15:15.531]  They just break into people's salons and have their way with their bathroom for two and a half hours and then leave it with the alarms ringing and unlocked.
[01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:20.392]  I mean, they put on display for the world that Secret Service can't be relied on, for Jack Squad.
[01:15:20.732 --> 01:15:23.253]  And that is sort of like, I forget what movie it was, but this criminal says,
[01:15:23.613 --> 01:15:28.998]  I offer a million dollars to anyone who busts me out of jail as I'm in, you know, transport from one drill to the next.
[01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:34.103]  They basically greenlit any bad player to say, they're a bunch of idiots bumbling nincompoops.
[01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:35.364]  Let's have our way.
[01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:44.393]  Elon Musk, and we'll play the clip in a moment, said in that big interview two days ago that they've tried to suppress, they've got a billion views, showing how dead the corporate media is.
[01:15:45.469 --> 01:15:47.990]  I mean, that was just one of the biggest interviews in history, probably the biggest.
[01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:50.711]  I mean, a billion views, folks.
[01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:55.552]  Did 200 million with the Putin interview just on Exelon with Tucker Carlson, but a billion views.
[01:15:55.592 --> 01:16:00.974]  They spun it because the audio was a little bad, you know, here and there that, oh, Trump slurring his words and all the rest of this.
[01:16:01.354 --> 01:16:02.615]  But Musk said something very simple.
[01:16:02.655 --> 01:16:02.955]  He said,
[01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:04.976]  With Trump, you get prosperity.
[01:16:04.996 --> 01:16:06.117]  With Kamala, you get the opposite.
[01:16:06.498 --> 01:16:10.662]  And so, no one's going to buy them stealing this election this time.
[01:16:11.342 --> 01:16:13.364]  They're clearly trying to put out these fake polls.
[01:16:13.404 --> 01:16:15.106]  We looked at the methodology.
[01:16:15.126 --> 01:16:16.007]  They are fake polls.
[01:16:16.047 --> 01:16:17.548]  Some of the polls don't even have methodology on them.
[01:16:17.568 --> 01:16:21.712]  That's when you know you've got a fake poll, saying she's way ahead and all this crap.
[01:16:22.112 --> 01:16:23.694]  What else do you expect them to do politically?
[01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:31.095]  Well, there's that article that appeared in Politico just yesterday, the day before, about the hacking conference in Vegas.
[01:16:31.115 --> 01:16:34.397]  They call it, it's called Defcon Voting Village.
[01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:35.657]  It's such a wild name.
[01:16:35.677 --> 01:16:43.301]  It's like Defcon is the coolest name on earth, and voting village sounds like a place in Florida, where they try to hack voting machines to expose vulnerabilities.
[01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:46.022]  They do it every year, and they expose vulnerabilities every year.
[01:16:46.283 --> 01:16:51.125]  But they just ran the story yesterday, the day before, saying it was in Politico, reported elsewhere.
[01:16:51.545 --> 01:16:59.956]  They've exposed vulnerabilities at all levels of voting machines or the election process, from the voting machines to e-books or e-polls, whatever those are.
[01:17:00.577 --> 01:17:06.404]  And there's not enough time to remedy the vulnerabilities that the hackers discovered in a mere two and a half days of hacking.
[01:17:07.114 --> 01:17:15.057]  What they're doing right now, this is like, I borrowed your expression, you know, it's the same play, just, you know, apply differently depending on the facts.
[01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:19.439]  2016, before Trump got elected, they were floating the idea of voting machines not being secure.
[01:17:19.479 --> 01:17:21.600]  We had known about it for decades because it's been an old issue.
[01:17:22.533 --> 01:17:26.755]  And I believe they did that, you know, to cast some doubt on if Trump were to have won.
[01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:32.216]  2020, when everybody knows it was chicanery up the wazoo, you can't challenge election results, period.
[01:17:32.236 --> 01:17:33.597]  You can't challenge voting machines at all.
[01:17:33.837 --> 01:17:39.899]  Dominion, here's a $787 million from Fox News for even having suggested that your voting machines were crap.
[01:17:40.439 --> 01:17:49.565]  Now they're saying vulnerabilities exposed in two and a half days, where bad players have had access or have been doing this 24-7, we can't resolve these vulnerabilities because there's not enough time.
[01:17:49.585 --> 01:18:00.473]  And so if Trump gets elected, you either go to Jamie Raskin, scoundrel, I'll call him Jamie Raskin, and say you're disqualified because of insurrection, even though that's exactly what the Supreme Court said is not possible.
[01:18:01.053 --> 01:18:06.637]  Or you go, it was stolen because of election interference, and you just burned the entire country down.
[01:18:07.037 --> 01:18:09.919]  I mean, they're seeding the grass right now.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:10.800]  We're good.
[01:18:24.841 --> 01:18:25.001]  I agree.
[01:18:25.021 --> 01:18:26.822]  That's one of the probably the most probable scenarios.
[01:18:26.842 --> 01:18:27.502]  So how do we counter that?
[01:18:50.651 --> 01:18:51.952]  That might be beyond my pay grade.
[01:18:51.972 --> 01:18:59.896]  I don't know, because what I believe is that they have whipped up an unhinged portion of the population to a point of no return.
[01:19:00.496 --> 01:19:02.537]  And, you know, the Rosie O'Donnells of the world, the
[01:19:03.996 --> 01:19:24.641]  I want to say that the media, they have all of the levers to really whip up the masses, to whip up people into a violent response should Trump get re-elected, which by all accounts, and I don't want anybody thinking it's in the bag and you get people out and vote, but by all metrics and by all just common sense, people love Trump and people hate Kamala Harris.
[01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:25.541]  She was always hated.
[01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:26.461]  She was always detestable.
[01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:31.952]  Ronald Reagan got the most votes of almost any Republican ever after he got shot.
[01:19:32.512 --> 01:19:34.753]  He was popular but really popular after he got shot.
[01:19:36.634 --> 01:19:40.116]  The cynic in me says they don't go after Trump a second time.
[01:19:40.516 --> 01:19:49.780]  On the one hand because he made a very wise decision with his VP pick and the consequences would be different now than they would have been had they succeeded the day before or the two days before the convention.
[01:19:50.925 --> 01:20:02.808]  Deep dark cynic says they go after someone on the Democrat side, solve a number of problems, you know, replace with a popular candidate, get the sympathy vote, lock down all forms of voting, declare martial law because of domestic terrorism.
[01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:07.810]  And look, it doesn't even have to be, I mean, obviously it doesn't have to be done by someone on the right.
[01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:11.551]  And by the way, there's cyclists all over TV saying civil war and martial law is coming.
[01:20:12.011 --> 01:20:15.292]  It's not like, like you said, they set up, they pre-set up the pieces.
[01:20:17.574 --> 01:20:22.241]  They put up that stupid, I mean, it was a terrible movie, that Netflix Civil War movie.
[01:20:22.802 --> 01:20:27.470]  They get people to, it's pre-suasion, and they plant the seeds.
[01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:30.315]  They basically tell you what they're doing in real time.
[01:20:31.044 --> 01:20:32.125]  Yeah, let me give you an analogy.
[01:20:32.165 --> 01:20:43.432]  It's like you come home, or maybe you're cooking dinner, so you get home early, you're going to cook hamburgers and stuff, and you get the hamburgers out, you get all the fixings out, your wife walks in, she knows what's for dinner.
[01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:47.435]  I mean, they've got the meal out, or let's say you're having...
[01:20:47.975 --> 01:20:51.557]  Chicken cordon bleu, and you see the chicken, and they're stuffing it with the ham and the cheese.
[01:20:51.837 --> 01:20:53.177]  I mean, you know what's for dinner.
[01:20:53.197 --> 01:20:58.019]  Your wife's cooking pasta, or you walk into the kitchen, you smell bacon, you're cooking bacon.
[01:20:58.039 --> 01:21:00.700]  I mean, they've got the whole meal ready to serve right now.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.201]  They're already laying it all out.
[01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:11.047]  I mean, I have to go back to the Raskin statement because it's the most dangerous statement you can possibly make politically speaking.
[01:21:11.487 --> 01:21:23.976]  Short of saying we're going to set him up on a podium to be whacked by an unhinged kid that we've left the roof open for, they're saying we are going to disqualify the democratically elected candidate
[01:21:24.316 --> 01:21:42.364]  While they are simultaneously accusing that candidate of being the next Hitler who will never relinquish power if he's ever elected, what I pray, if I can pray in my heart of hearts, is that there will be whistleblowers in Secret Service, in intelligence, in the government, who are going to reveal things that will even make it undeniable for
[01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.625]  Fence-sitting or middle-of-the-ground Democrats.
[01:21:46.025 --> 01:21:57.328]  That the deep state, the apparatus, has just gone too far, and it's time to clean house and not start from scratch, just disband, dismantle, and implement new infrastructure.
[01:21:58.028 --> 01:22:00.068]  I don't want it to get bad.
[01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:09.811]  I left Canada so that I could come to a place where we can still fight for freedom, speak with freedom, and live a free life, and Florida's been a great place for that.
[01:22:10.311 --> 01:22:21.800]  But they really will do anything to fabricate a pretext, to lock everything down, to lock everyone up, to shut everyone up, and to shut everything down so that they can then say, well, look back to the polls in August.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:28.785]  Kamala Harris had a great lead, and she really wowed everybody, even though everybody knows that she's a rambling idiot.
[01:22:29.065 --> 01:22:33.749]  We've got to go to Bright, but you're dead on here that the whole world's fallen to tyranny.
[01:22:33.769 --> 01:22:38.412]  Look at England, where the judge says, you said Muslims are raping people 20 months in prison.
[01:22:38.472 --> 01:22:38.912]  Actual clip.
[01:22:40.472 --> 01:22:41.152]  It's right.
[01:22:41.212 --> 01:22:42.693]  Your back's against the wall, so's mine.
[01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:43.673]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:22:44.213 --> 01:22:46.174]  Everywhere's a tyranny now, except El Salvador.
[01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:48.095]  Who knows how long they'll hold on.
[01:22:48.495 --> 01:22:50.596]  So we're really back up against the wall here.
[01:22:50.616 --> 01:22:53.997]  People could put America down all day and, boy, we got problems, but we're the best house in the bad neighborhood.
[01:22:54.017 --> 01:22:57.858]  And here's Viva Frye, a great guy down there with his family, literally escaping Canada.
[01:22:57.879 --> 01:23:00.319]  That is a real tyranny under Trudeau.
[01:23:00.399 --> 01:23:03.020]  I mean, a WEF model.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.921]  We'll come back and talk about it all with Viva Frye.
[01:23:04.941 --> 01:23:05.401]  Stay with us.
[01:23:06.202 --> 01:23:07.062]  Nitric Boost.
[01:23:08.002 --> 01:23:08.482]  Turmeric 95.
[01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:13.638]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:23:14.598 --> 01:23:19.580]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:27.242]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:29.783]  They let us private label their products.
[01:23:29.803 --> 01:23:30.663]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:23:31.543 --> 01:23:32.605]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[01:23:32.905 --> 01:23:35.668]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:23:35.908 --> 01:23:37.230]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:40.494]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:23:41.255 --> 01:23:41.876]  That's the name.
[01:23:42.136 --> 01:23:47.803]  So, we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[01:23:48.283 --> 01:23:48.604]  Tumeric.
[01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:49.885]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[01:23:50.326 --> 01:23:51.948]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[01:23:51.968 --> 01:23:53.991]  They even let us use their name.
[01:23:54.291 --> 01:23:55.293]  It's now our best seller.
[01:23:55.493 --> 01:23:56.494]  We sold out of our version.
[01:23:56.755 --> 01:23:58.197]  Their version has a white model.
[01:23:58.537 --> 01:23:59.959]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.062]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:02.302 --> 01:24:04.766]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:05.839 --> 01:24:11.301]  I want to shift gears in a few minutes into Elon Musk and other big topics with Viva Frye, one of the smartest people I know.
[01:24:11.822 --> 01:24:14.543]  But you were finishing up when you got cut off by the break about what we need to do.
[01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:15.343]  And I totally agree.
[01:24:15.983 --> 01:24:27.108]  We already have major multiple Secret Service whistleblowers that came out and exposed that Ronald Rowe, the head of the Secret Service, who was the deputy head, was actually in control and lied to Congress.
[01:24:28.052 --> 01:24:28.872]  But again, there's no teeth.
[01:24:28.892 --> 01:24:29.873]  No one gets in trouble.
[01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.514]  And I'm not saying you're wrong.
[01:24:32.554 --> 01:24:33.134]  I hope you're right.
[01:24:33.154 --> 01:24:36.256]  I think they might back off because they already tried once.
[01:24:36.316 --> 01:24:37.176]  It'll be too obvious.
[01:24:37.216 --> 01:24:41.838]  So I've been saying kill a Democrat, kill Kamala, kill Biden, something like that.
[01:24:42.818 --> 01:24:48.221]  But definitely they don't give up, just like they've launched this big NATO-backed incursion 60 miles into Russia.
[01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:49.997]  We're good to go.
[01:25:14.804 --> 01:25:15.944]  No, that's it.
[01:25:16.124 --> 01:25:19.205]  It's short of letting them provoke you into an act of violence.
[01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:24.647]  The real concern is that they can allow one to happen and then blame it on you in the first place.
[01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:28.368]  So it has to be constant, vocal, none of this violence.
[01:25:28.388 --> 01:25:31.468]  And if it happens, it's another Fed's direction type thing.
[01:25:31.488 --> 01:25:33.529]  I mean, I'm talking myself out of it.
[01:25:33.569 --> 01:25:34.129]  I'm not out of it.
[01:25:34.509 --> 01:25:41.051]  I'm depressing myself as I talk, because in January 6th, and as much as there was violence, I believe it was a Fed motive, a Fed
[01:25:42.553 --> 01:25:43.954]  No, it's overwhelming.
[01:25:43.974 --> 01:25:47.896]  In the same crew that did the Whitmer fake kidnapping attempt, they ran Jan 6 setup.
[01:25:48.436 --> 01:25:49.837]  Well, that's what I was going to get to.
[01:25:49.877 --> 01:25:56.120]  Then you get the Whitmer fake kidnapping plot, where people were actually acquitted on the basis of FBI entrapment.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.662]  And then you have the same players going into Jan 6, and then you've got the same players in Jan 6.
[01:26:00.729 --> 01:26:04.391]  Who deleted the text messages of Capitol Police and others.
[01:26:04.831 --> 01:26:09.553]  The guy is testifying about this failed security issue who's now involved in the Trump assassination attempt.
[01:26:10.634 --> 01:26:11.854]  I mean, it's dark.
[01:26:12.054 --> 01:26:15.376]  It's dark and sinister because it also doesn't necessarily need to be on American soil.
[01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:22.399]  You have some sort of act of terrorism in Europe on a massive scale and you'll have preemptive lockdowns.
[01:26:22.799 --> 01:26:27.364]  And then they'll go from talking about the vulnerabilities of voting machines to saying, we've solved it all.
[01:26:27.665 --> 01:26:31.429]  You can vote with your iPhone, just put in your social security number if you have one.
[01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:39.458]  But the bottom line is, you cannot despair and you can't let them get you into a position where you do something counterproductive and against your own interests.
[01:26:40.077 --> 01:26:43.958]  And so it's a question of just make people aware and talk to people and share.
[01:26:44.138 --> 01:26:49.639]  And Elon Musk, you know, it's the perfect segue, did just that and it pisses them off more than anything in the world.
[01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:55.561]  And as I say it pisses off, I realize I have a bit of a lisp as well, which is enhanced on these Twitter spaces.
[01:26:55.901 --> 01:27:05.223]  But you get that interview, a long format two plus hour interview with Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two exquisitely intelligent and personable human beings.
[01:27:05.896 --> 01:27:10.420]  They hate it more than anything because it is the exact opposite of Kamala Harris.
[01:27:10.921 --> 01:27:13.022]  And so what do they have to do with that?
[01:27:13.042 --> 01:27:18.167]  I mean, they've got to find a way to demonize, downplay that, you know, disinformation that into oblivion.
[01:27:18.427 --> 01:27:25.834]  And so they went with this whole Trump having a lisp, cognitive impairment, some stroke in real time, unfit to serve, all of which is only true of Joe Biden.
[01:27:26.214 --> 01:27:29.117]  And at the same time, Kamala is doing no interviews.
[01:27:30.772 --> 01:27:30.952]  None.
[01:27:31.172 --> 01:27:33.835]  And they want to talk about lawfare yet again.
[01:27:34.195 --> 01:27:37.858]  So you have, I forget that guy's name, Thierry, the European Union guy.
[01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:38.578]  What's his last name?
[01:27:39.079 --> 01:27:40.099]  I make a joke about it.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.304]  He looks like the face of what the militia fought against the British in 1777.
[01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:55.832]  He looks like the face of arrogant pomposity royalty saying, you know, you'd better suppress some of that information, disinformation, when you're interviewing Trump.
[01:27:56.372 --> 01:28:00.954]  Otherwise we might have to impose some of our regulatory power on you and you won't like it.
[01:28:01.955 --> 01:28:10.218]  And we have a CBS reporter whining at a press conference saying you can't let, telling the White House, you can't let Trump talk to Musk.
[01:28:10.258 --> 01:28:11.899]  I mean they're open to totalitarians.
[01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:17.228]  The guy's like, I believe that there's a lot of disinformation and misinformation on Twitter.
[01:28:17.428 --> 01:28:20.030]  First of all, as a journalist, nobody cares what you believe.
[01:28:20.311 --> 01:28:22.152]  This is an anecdote I share on my channel all the time.
[01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:27.357]  When I was a young lawyer and, you know, the older lawyers that you work under, they say, what do you think of this?
[01:28:27.377 --> 01:28:29.680]  And you say, I think, they say, no, sorry, you misunderstood.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.560]  I don't care what you think.
[01:28:30.781 --> 01:28:32.923]  Tell me what the judges think and tell me what the law says.
[01:28:33.623 --> 01:28:41.331]  A journalist is not there to tell the person he's asking a question to what he thinks and what they need to do to put into action his personal thoughts and beliefs.
[01:28:41.612 --> 01:28:48.599]  But he does it, and then Karine Jean-Pierre, the other idiot DEI hire, is like, well, I don't have any notes on this, so I don't know how to answer that question.
[01:28:48.899 --> 01:28:50.821]  But, you know, we'll see what happens.
[01:28:51.408 --> 01:29:12.836]  They're asking for censorship in real time because they know they lose on the exchange of ideas, and they try to go for the lawfare threats against Elon Musk, saying—I forget which idiot it was, it's floating the idea—that what Elon Musk did was a campaign contribution to Trump, and it's an excessive, undisclosed campaign contribution, that he gave this two-and-a-half-hour, two-hour interview to Trump.
[01:29:13.296 --> 01:29:16.557]  He offered it to that empty, that
[01:29:17.205 --> 01:29:24.339]  Kamala Harris, and she obviously will say no because she'll get not even destroyed, she'll get exposed.
[01:29:25.049 --> 01:29:26.550]  Or the brain-dead idiot that she is.
[01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.031]  And by the way, that's another question.
[01:29:28.091 --> 01:29:30.273]  Why do they keep selecting people that can't talk?
[01:29:30.814 --> 01:29:42.543]  And my answer is the bureaucracy wants someone that's a front person, that discredits the country at the same time, they can do whatever they want, the permanent bureaucracy can, the deep state, and then the puppet just gets moved off and a new puppet comes in.
[01:29:42.883 --> 01:29:49.568]  They're not selecting Fetterman and Harris and Biden when he declined so much by accident.
[01:29:49.608 --> 01:29:51.049]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:29:51.369 --> 01:29:51.930]  Can you speak to that?
[01:29:52.563 --> 01:30:06.550]  Well, I actually do think that they would have preferred to have gone with a Gavin Newsom to replace Biden, or even a Gretchen Whitmer, because they are, for all their sins and for all their evil, at least they're reasonably intelligent on their feet.
[01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:06.950]  Reasonably.
[01:30:07.737 --> 01:30:16.861]  Uh, I think the legal reason why they had to go with Kamala as the replacement is so they don't have too much of a hard fight over whatever it was, the hundred million that they had in the war chest already.
[01:30:16.901 --> 01:30:19.262]  I mean, I agree with you that they want somebody that can at least talk.
[01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:24.524]  So then why do we, why do we keep seeing basically vegetables?
[01:30:25.613 --> 01:30:33.820]  Well, Federman healed up a bit, and as he healed up, he sort of got more of his logic about him, but he seems to have gone off the TDS wagon yet again.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.821]  Kamala Harris is an abject idiot.
[01:30:35.861 --> 01:30:36.402]  Everybody knew it.
[01:30:36.462 --> 01:30:41.526]  It's part of the reason why many think Biden picked her in the first place, so she wouldn't be a threat to him.
[01:30:42.987 --> 01:30:52.092]  You know, he never knew that she'd stab him in the back at the end of the day, but they only went with her because they needed that $100 million that they raised for the Biden for president, and they wouldn't have been able to transfer it, I don't think, to a gaffer.
[01:30:52.112 --> 01:30:52.733]  Well, that's right.
[01:30:52.793 --> 01:30:59.957]  Isn't it a spectacle to watch the Deep State wage war with the people, but also fighting over the crown in front of everyone?
[01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:07.502]  It's wild, but this is what's been a little bit blackpilling for me, or I dare say even doom-pilling.
[01:31:08.002 --> 01:31:10.784]  You realize that for a swath of, I don't know,
[01:31:11.678 --> 01:31:13.000]  A hundred million Americans.
[01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:16.985]  Elections are soundbites and elections are branding.
[01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:18.527]  They don't know what they're buying.
[01:31:18.547 --> 01:31:21.131]  They don't know what's in it, but they like the packaging.
[01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:25.377]  And when you see Donald Trump do two hour interviews with Elon Musk,
[01:31:26.282 --> 01:31:32.243]  Thoughtful, insightful discussion, and then they brand that, the media, as a list issue, a tech issue.
[01:31:32.463 --> 01:31:36.004]  You know, they were 40 minutes late because Elon doesn't know how to run his company.
[01:31:36.344 --> 01:31:48.086]  And then they take the empty vat that's Kamala Harris and that useless idiot that's Tim Walz, and all they do is like 30-second clips of scripted speech that might not be in front of people to begin with.
[01:31:48.146 --> 01:31:52.567]  I don't mean the rallies, I'm sure she gets people at her rallies, but these stump speeches
[01:31:52.947 --> 01:31:59.110]  Which are just highly curated, totally drafted or scripted speeches, and they brand it.
[01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.912]  And that is what people, you know, get convinced by.
[01:32:01.952 --> 01:32:07.775]  They're on social media, they see a 30 second clip, Kamala Harris, reasonable looking person, a nice clip, good music.
[01:32:07.795 --> 01:32:10.296]  I'm going to vote for that even though I don't know what's in that product.
[01:32:10.536 --> 01:32:12.437]  And the reality is there's nothing in that product.
[01:32:12.897 --> 01:32:16.219]  But then you realize it's just how elections are run and it's very depressing because
[01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:42.761]  The low information voters, and I don't mean stupid people, I don't mean bad people, I mean people who are too involved with their own lives and their own existence to live this daily like we do, don't know what they are voting for, they don't know what they're getting, but my goodness do they like the packaging, and my goodness is the media good at rebranding this individual right here, who has always been detested, detestable, stupid, incompetent, succeeded only through extracurricular activity, and they've reinvented her.
[01:32:42.941 --> 01:32:45.883]  And now we're told she's invincible.
[01:32:45.903 --> 01:32:47.465]  82 days of the election.
[01:32:47.525 --> 01:32:51.007]  I'm more concerned about the 79 between that and the inauguration.
[01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:56.151]  I believe Trump is going to win because the numbers show it's so overwhelming, but they're going to pull something big.
[01:32:56.192 --> 01:32:57.853]  Raskin said civil war, you name it.
[01:32:58.433 --> 01:33:00.795]  It's 158 days until that key point.
[01:33:01.736 --> 01:33:02.917]  What would your advice be to Trump?
[01:33:02.937 --> 01:33:04.258]  And then I want to shift gears back to Musk.
[01:33:04.638 --> 01:33:07.320]  What did you think of the two hour transmission?
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:08.661]  We had over two and a half million people.
[01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.571]  That watched our streams just covering it.
[01:33:11.933 --> 01:33:13.258]  It was so much powerful stuff.
[01:33:13.881 --> 01:33:14.845]  What did you think was the best part?
[01:33:16.375 --> 01:33:25.817]  Well, first of all, the discussion over on a substantive level, the discussion over inflation, it's just people don't understand it, but they simplified it for anybody who was listening.
[01:33:26.238 --> 01:33:32.179]  And what I love is that these idiots who want to demonize all of the, you know, what they discussed, and they share these clips.
[01:33:32.779 --> 01:33:37.660]  Congrats, you're giving these clips a lot more exposure than they would have otherwise gotten by exposing them to your audience.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:44.222]  But you know, the idea that we'll meet in Venezuela, and then the left wing media runs with it as though Trump is saying he's going to flee America.
[01:33:44.902 --> 01:33:53.305]  Well, what he was saying, and they allowed this to be amplified, is the crime rate in Venezuela is going down because they're allowing migration of criminals into America.
[01:33:53.565 --> 01:34:03.268]  So congrats, you thought you had an own through disinformation on Trump, but you've only put that element on blast, that the crime rate in Venezuela has gone down because of criminality migration.
[01:34:04.358 --> 01:34:05.218]  Those are my favorite subjects.
[01:34:05.238 --> 01:34:06.039]  And Trump was clear.
[01:34:06.059 --> 01:34:09.500]  He said Venezuela is getting better than us now because they're putting all the criminals here.
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:14.442]  It was a joke he made and they just run a headline saying Trump to flee to Venezuela.
[01:34:14.742 --> 01:34:15.463]  It's preposterous.
[01:34:16.063 --> 01:34:24.426]  It's preposterous and they're idiots and even in the 21 second clip that they try to put out there it's clear that he was saying we'll meet for lunch in Venezuela because it's safer than it is in America.
[01:34:24.446 --> 01:34:27.928]  A hyperbolic but you know the point got out there nonetheless.
[01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:30.469]  What I love about all of it is the style.
[01:34:30.909 --> 01:34:33.190]  Trump got out with his press conference last week and he
[01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:34.451]  Rambled?
[01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:36.194]  Put it in quotes?
[01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:37.675]  It's an unscripted press conference.
[01:34:37.716 --> 01:34:38.697]  That's what they look like.
[01:34:39.017 --> 01:34:44.825]  Nobody wants scripted reading off a teleprompter because you are unable to think on your own and when you do... Listen, listen.
[01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:47.308]  Sometimes I say really thought-provoking things and I'm on target.
[01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:49.691]  Sometimes I listen to the show, I ramble.
[01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:50.893]  People actually like that.
[01:34:50.933 --> 01:34:51.594]  They know it's real.
[01:34:52.498 --> 01:34:53.158]  Well, absolutely.
[01:34:53.198 --> 01:34:55.759]  And also, that's what a press conference is supposed to be.
[01:34:55.779 --> 01:35:06.461]  You know, Robert Barnes, my partner-in-law, he was talking about in the olden days when someone would get up on a stump and talk, back in the days when politicians were expected to know how to talk on their feet.
[01:35:06.521 --> 01:35:08.102]  Look at the Lincoln-Douglas debates.
[01:35:08.622 --> 01:35:09.262]  What'd those go?
[01:35:09.282 --> 01:35:10.983]  I'm going to remember, like, 10 hours or something?
[01:35:11.403 --> 01:35:12.683]  Some debates would go for days?
[01:35:13.083 --> 01:35:15.584]  Guys, look up how long the Lincoln-Douglas debates went.
[01:35:16.984 --> 01:35:18.184]  That might be a little bit too long.
[01:35:18.224 --> 01:35:20.685]  I mean, I've got a short attention span, but I can sit through two hours and
[01:35:21.497 --> 01:35:27.720]  No, but I'm saying in the old days, people really wanted to hear you for a long time to see if you were just doing talking points or you were smart.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:34.342]  Well, absolutely, because a three-hour podcast with Joe Rogan, it's very hard to be a phony for three hours.
[01:35:34.722 --> 01:35:37.943]  And so, you know, Trump gets up and he says, look what I'm doing.
[01:35:38.044 --> 01:35:41.585]  I am doing what Kamala Harris will never do because she cannot do it.
[01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:44.846]  And then they have to say, oh, he's rambling, he's talking about it.
[01:35:44.886 --> 01:35:46.287]  Yeah, first of all, it's fine.
[01:35:46.447 --> 01:35:47.967]  That's what a discussion is supposed to be like.
[01:35:48.388 --> 01:35:49.428]  So that's what I loved about it.
[01:35:49.928 --> 01:35:56.434]  And I think he's, look, there's some theories that he's not going hard enough on Kamala now and he should be doing a little more.
[01:35:56.734 --> 01:36:03.580]  Other people are retorting that he wants to make sure that they lock in Kamala at the DNC convention in Chicago and they don't play another switcheroo.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.062]  So, don't go as hard on Kamala now.
[01:36:06.082 --> 01:36:10.525]  Between me and you and the fence post, I've talked to high level, that's actually what he's doing.
[01:36:10.665 --> 01:36:13.588]  Once she's confirmed, he's going to rip the living hell out of her.
[01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:15.037]  Absolutely good.
[01:36:15.538 --> 01:36:18.900]  It's like, it's the softest, easiest target on earth.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.962]  And Tim, tampon Tim or no balls walls.
[01:36:22.182 --> 01:36:23.843]  I mean, these are easy targets.
[01:36:24.243 --> 01:36:33.289]  And there were some people, I was talking to somebody else, I was fishing at Loxahatchee and I'm talking to a guy and he's like, yeah, he should have gone that hard on Biden because he should have let Biden stay until the nomination.
[01:36:33.689 --> 01:36:36.871]  They had another way of eliminating Biden that they would have done.
[01:36:37.111 --> 01:36:38.772]  The 25th was one threat.
[01:36:39.072 --> 01:36:41.614]  The other threat was another jab or another boost if people get what I'm
[01:36:42.154 --> 01:36:42.795]  You're absolutely right.
[01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:43.755]  Let me play a clip.
[01:36:43.775 --> 01:36:46.117]  I mean, I played a bunch of these yesterday, but man, it's so good, actually.
[01:36:46.658 --> 01:36:49.840]  And going back to energy, and I'll find the energy clip too, Trump goes,
[01:37:08.564 --> 01:37:12.246]  You increase energy, and it cuts inflation.
[01:37:12.346 --> 01:37:21.289]  Well, anybody that really knows the economy knows the basis of it is cheap oil, cheap gas, cheap electricity, however you generate it, and cheap fertilizer.
[01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:27.192]  If you don't have cheap food, and if you don't have cheap energy, that's what drags economies down.
[01:37:27.432 --> 01:37:33.695]  Successful countries have infrastructure, they have brains, they have a culture, but you've got to have cheap energy.
[01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.557]  And we're shutting down a coal power plant every week.
[01:37:36.597 --> 01:37:37.417]  China's building three.
[01:37:37.937 --> 01:37:44.402]  So the point is, is they're literally turning the lights off, like in 2001 Space Odyssey, where he's turning off the HAL 9000.
[01:37:45.122 --> 01:37:46.123]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:37:46.503 --> 01:37:47.064]  I'm afraid.
[01:37:47.284 --> 01:37:50.206]  They're like literally just turning off our power, turning off our energy.
[01:37:50.486 --> 01:37:51.907]  And Trump goes, it's simple.
[01:37:52.247 --> 01:37:53.708]  You just make the energy cheap.
[01:37:53.748 --> 01:37:54.428]  That fixes it.
[01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:55.349]  And it's true.
[01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:57.791]  It won't fix it all because overprinting by the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:57.811 --> 01:38:03.935]  But if you don't have the precursor of all wealth is energy, folks, whether it's for plants, animals, humans, machines.
[01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:11.528]  And this is to highlight, I'm not sure which clip you're going to play, but just to highlight what an empty vassal and utter idiot Kamala Harris is.
[01:38:12.216 --> 01:38:17.580]  She's in office now, like it seems to me that she's forgotten that she's the administration that's caused all of these problems.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.703]  She's in one of her stump speeches where I don't know if she went off script or she just has idiot speech writers.
[01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:26.326]  She's like, when I was attorney general, I went after price gouges.
[01:38:26.746 --> 01:38:28.987]  And so I'm gonna do that to counter inflation.
[01:38:29.428 --> 01:38:32.590]  Inflation is not the result of price gouging, period.
[01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:35.412]  Price gouging does not cause inflation, period.
[01:38:35.732 --> 01:38:37.853]  So as a matter of economy, she's an idiot.
[01:38:38.273 --> 01:38:39.815]  As a matter of- But let me just back you up.
[01:38:39.855 --> 01:38:41.556]  Remember when Biden, three and a half years ago,
[01:38:42.396 --> 01:38:46.758]  As soon as he got in, oil prices exploded because he cut all the drilling permits and cut off pipelines.
[01:38:47.018 --> 01:38:49.299]  He said the gas stations are gouging.
[01:38:49.699 --> 01:38:55.681]  Anybody that studies industry knows gas stations on average basically break even or lose money, okay?
[01:38:56.101 --> 01:39:04.945]  The gas, just to get you there, they make money on the lottery tickets and the drinks and the cigarettes and the ice cream.
[01:39:05.265 --> 01:39:07.826]  So again, blaming the gas stations, folks.
[01:39:09.364 --> 01:39:11.946]  Alex, Biden, I think, might have known better.
[01:39:11.966 --> 01:39:15.369]  I'm not sure about Kamala, but I had actually looked into buying a gas station.
[01:39:15.389 --> 01:39:16.530]  This is way back in the day.
[01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:19.912]  Just mildly look at the P&L statements.
[01:39:19.932 --> 01:39:24.576]  Like, yeah, the margins are, you don't buy that type of job if you have choices.
[01:39:24.896 --> 01:39:28.739]  And then the cleanup and the decontaminations are wild.
[01:39:28.959 --> 01:39:35.664]  But Biden gets into office and immediately does two things that cause a number, at least two of the big problems now that we've seen.
[01:39:36.224 --> 01:39:42.589]  And, you know, cuts the Keystone Pipeline, which has some benefits to Canada as well, and then reverses Trump on the border issues.
[01:39:42.909 --> 01:39:45.992]  And so, you know, it's the beginning of inflation, and it's true.
[01:39:46.012 --> 01:39:47.453]  Don't want to be accused of ignoring it.
[01:39:47.933 --> 01:39:51.636]  The printing of the trillions as part of the COVID issue.
[01:39:51.656 --> 01:39:55.619]  Part of it is lays at the feet of the stimulus packages.
[01:39:56.716 --> 01:39:57.097]  Absolutely.
[01:39:57.137 --> 01:39:58.538]  So you can't ignore that.
[01:39:59.158 --> 01:40:01.280]  And then people say, well, that takes three years to kick in.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.563]  The war with... See, this is where people are just dumb and liars.
[01:40:05.884 --> 01:40:09.026]  They say, oh, that takes three years to kick in, so it's as a result of the stimulus packages.
[01:40:09.366 --> 01:40:15.491]  Except about a year ago, they would say that the inflation was caused by Putin's war in Ukraine, which was contemporaneous.
[01:40:15.752 --> 01:40:22.957]  So when they want to draw it back to place the blame three years ago, they say, oh, it takes time for the stimulus package printing money to cause inflation.
[01:40:23.238 --> 01:40:25.279]  But when it's immediate, they then blame it on Putin.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.643]  And by the way, she's in power right now.
[01:40:46.195 --> 01:40:47.697]  So all of this is ridiculous.
[01:40:47.737 --> 01:40:53.282]  Here's a clip I want to play, though, that was very short, but very simple and very true with Elon saying, look, I'm for prosperity.
[01:40:53.343 --> 01:40:54.464]  With Trump, you get prosperity.
[01:40:55.144 --> 01:40:58.288]  Not perfect, but you know, because this is not a perfect world we're already in, folks.
[01:40:58.308 --> 01:40:59.009]  He's inheriting this.
[01:40:59.609 --> 01:41:00.750]  But with her, you get the opposite.
[01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:01.051]  Here it is.
[01:41:02.745 --> 01:41:03.105]  I think?
[01:41:21.276 --> 01:41:23.078]  Administration with with Kamala.
[01:41:23.098 --> 01:41:24.358]  That's that's my honest opinion.
[01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:31.523]  I mean her dad is literally I mean she was brought up as a cop as an actual dad is like is a Marxist economist.
[01:41:31.543 --> 01:41:34.685]  That's you can google it I mean, it's not a we're not making this up.
[01:41:34.785 --> 01:41:37.207]  You know That's how she was brought up.
[01:41:37.447 --> 01:41:49.355]  So And and we just we want to have a future that is prosperous and and I think we're just at this critical juncture and and it I think this is a case of
[01:41:51.655 --> 01:42:03.084]  America is at a fork in the road and I think it will take the path, like you are the path to prosperity and I think Kamala is the opposite.
[01:42:03.585 --> 01:42:09.569]  I'm going to get attacked like crazy and I've also experienced quite a bit of lawfare myself.
[01:42:12.005 --> 01:42:17.651]  I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion and I haven't been really active in politics before.
[01:42:28.363 --> 01:42:28.803]  Outbreak.
[01:42:28.824 --> 01:42:31.245]  They've been trying to get the bird flu hysteria going.
[01:42:31.265 --> 01:42:32.006]  That hasn't worked.
[01:42:32.666 --> 01:42:33.347]  New York Times.
[01:42:33.587 --> 01:42:37.249]  WHO declares global emergency over new monkeypox outbreak.
[01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:38.490]  Wow.
[01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:41.052]  Because they couldn't get their power grabbing treaty through.
[01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:41.692]  Here's AP.
[01:42:42.092 --> 01:42:44.854]  Monkeypox has been declared a public health emergency in Africa.
[01:42:45.715 --> 01:42:47.896]  What is it and what is the WHO doing?
[01:42:47.956 --> 01:42:48.917]  Oh, there are saviors.
[01:42:49.077 --> 01:42:50.318]  Give me your take on that.
[01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:55.947]  I don't even know what you're going to call this when you have the China virus.
[01:42:55.967 --> 01:42:57.808]  I don't know what you're going to call this.
[01:42:57.868 --> 01:42:58.389]  It's outrageous.
[01:42:58.409 --> 01:42:59.109]  Nobody trusts them.
[01:42:59.129 --> 01:42:59.509]  They know it.
[01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:00.990]  And there's a reason why these corrupt
[01:43:16.613 --> 01:43:21.596]  Globalist organizations who are unelected should have zero say in national politics.
[01:43:21.616 --> 01:43:22.157]  Well, that's right.
[01:43:22.197 --> 01:43:23.818]  I mean, look, look, they're totally discredited.
[01:43:23.838 --> 01:43:24.839]  All the numbers show that.
[01:43:24.879 --> 01:43:25.539]  So what do they do?
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.061]  They keep trying the same old tricks.
[01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:34.005]  Make them more loud and they'll get a great MRNA shot that's going to work better on this than it did on the last stuff.
[01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:38.348]  First of all, Elon, I love the fact that he touches on this.
[01:43:39.388 --> 01:43:41.530]  Kamala Harris's father is a straight up communist.
[01:43:42.472 --> 01:43:44.135]  Communist in the literal sense of the word.
[01:43:44.155 --> 01:43:45.757]  We sort of use that word.
[01:43:45.797 --> 01:43:46.658]  And so does Walls.
[01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:48.781]  Walls, it turns out, is like a Chinese agent.
[01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:53.889]  Literally, like, lives over there and, like, collects Mao's Little Red Books.
[01:43:55.477 --> 01:43:58.660]  Well, let's call them statists, if anybody has a problem with the term communist.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:01.201]  They want the state to control every aspect of your life.
[01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:05.625]  But Kamala Harris... Just like Trudeau said, he said, I admire China's basic dictatorship.
[01:44:06.085 --> 01:44:06.625]  Absolutely.
[01:44:06.645 --> 01:44:09.587]  They can turn the economy around on a dime for green initiatives.
[01:44:09.648 --> 01:44:11.189]  The guy told you he was going to do 10 years ago.
[01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:21.336]  But, um, no, to highlight and just, you know, now a million plus people know Kamala Harris, the first black president, uh, presidential nominee who was Indian in 2020.
[01:44:21.896 --> 01:44:23.858]  And I love, you know, it was very funny what Trump said,
[01:44:24.298 --> 01:44:24.879]  Rebranded.
[01:44:25.199 --> 01:44:26.441]  Reintroduced as black now.
[01:44:26.702 --> 01:44:29.726]  Her father is a descendant of slave owners.
[01:44:30.206 --> 01:44:32.890]  Her father would have to pay reparations, not receive them.
[01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:35.734]  Her father is a basically a communist of sorts.
[01:44:36.195 --> 01:44:37.737]  And she was raised in Canada.
[01:44:38.137 --> 01:44:39.840]  And now I wholly understand
[01:44:40.453 --> 01:44:43.515]  The bottom line is Elon Musk highlights this and
[01:45:06.212 --> 01:45:09.475]  More people have heard it now than would have ever heard it and it drives them nuts.
[01:45:09.955 --> 01:45:13.559]  But Kamala Harris, I would not hold my breath for Kamala Harris to accept Elon's invite.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.621]  All right, we got a minute left.
[01:45:16.781 --> 01:45:17.842]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:45:17.862 --> 01:45:20.585]  We got a huge guest analysis and breaking news next hour.
[01:45:21.285 --> 01:45:24.228]  But in closing, any other key points you'd like to add?
[01:45:25.023 --> 01:45:35.913]  No, I would say it's going to be time to, I'll make a hashtag, balls to the walls on walls, because his stolen vow lie is one that cannot be ignored.
[01:45:36.594 --> 01:45:42.499]  I mean, if there's a hierarchy, Trump assassination attempt failed and Secret Service security failures cannot be ignored.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:49.025]  Right up there now is Tim Walz lying about his military combat experience.
[01:45:49.326 --> 01:45:50.146]  Had that been J.D.
[01:45:51.566 --> 01:45:54.488]  He would have been federally charged under the Stolen Valor Act.
[01:45:55.029 --> 01:45:55.489]  I guarantee it.
[01:45:55.509 --> 01:45:58.071]  I mean, they don't even need a pretext to sue you under the law.
[01:45:58.251 --> 01:46:00.453]  So that nobody should forget about.
[01:46:00.673 --> 01:46:02.934]  Go hard and don't be apologetic about it.
[01:46:02.954 --> 01:46:04.155]  You know, they went after J.D.
[01:46:04.195 --> 01:46:04.856]  Vance and called him
[01:46:05.872 --> 01:46:10.656]  And by the way, the new stuff, he outright says he's a combat vet Afghanistanian.
[01:46:10.716 --> 01:46:12.157]  The new stuff is totally damning.
[01:46:12.618 --> 01:46:13.839]  It's totally damning.
[01:46:14.039 --> 01:46:17.502]  Okay, I carried war weapons in war.
[01:46:17.522 --> 01:46:18.482]  He was never at war.
[01:46:19.403 --> 01:46:21.225]  And then they try to gaslight and reframe it.
[01:46:21.685 --> 01:46:22.926]  I'm proud of my career.
[01:46:23.046 --> 01:46:28.350]  You should be proud of your military career, which means you shouldn't have lied about what you didn't do in your 24 years of national service.
[01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:30.232]  He also basically deserted when it was time to go to war.
[01:46:31.579 --> 01:46:37.681]  And they tried to spin that and say, well, he filed his retirement papers before the deployment came, except he damn well knew that it was going.
[01:46:37.881 --> 01:46:45.043]  And they say that some people would run towards it, even if they had done that, would take their papers back and go serve with their men.
[01:46:45.303 --> 01:46:49.004]  But the bottom line, from what I understand, he knew damn well in advance that it was coming.
[01:46:49.104 --> 01:46:51.284]  And so he gets to make that defense on paper.
[01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:53.245]  But the accusations are true.
[01:46:53.705 --> 01:46:55.105]  He even had to apologize for it.
[01:46:55.125 --> 01:46:56.046]  So they say misspoke.
[01:46:56.406 --> 01:46:57.986]  When they do it, it's misspeaking.
[01:46:58.286 --> 01:46:59.587]  If a Republican or J.D.
[01:46:59.607 --> 01:47:00.787]  Vance had done it, it would have been a
[01:47:00.967 --> 01:47:01.427]  We're good to go.
[01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:29.162]  Don't forgive.
[01:47:29.463 --> 01:47:30.003]  Don't forget.
[01:47:30.023 --> 01:47:31.364]  Stay peaceful.
[01:47:31.444 --> 01:47:35.148]  Don't succumb to your more base instincts of like lashing out because that's what they want.
[01:47:35.428 --> 01:47:36.149]  Don't be provoked.
[01:47:36.529 --> 01:47:39.552]  But my goodness, social media has a power and use it for what it's worth.
[01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.430]  Absolutely.
[01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.991]  Thank you for having me.
[01:47:48.251 --> 01:47:48.551]  Thank you.
[01:47:49.012 --> 01:47:49.352]  All right.
[01:47:49.472 --> 01:47:56.198]  I'm not going to even tell you what's coming next hour because I've got like 10 different stacks, a bunch of clubs breaking news, new UN global health emergency, knew that was coming.
[01:47:56.778 --> 01:47:57.659]  I'm going to come right back.
[01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:59.200]  We're going to hit it all here today.
[01:48:00.021 --> 01:48:01.822]  And please remember, we're listener supported.

[01:48:12.932 --> 01:48:15.834]  And our other great sponsor is drjonesnaturals.com.

[01:48:21.296 --> 01:48:22.097]  Thanks for your support.
[01:48:22.517 --> 01:48:24.538]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:48:25.159 --> 01:48:29.481]  Only you're keeping us on the air, so I humbly ask you for support now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:48:30.106 --> 01:48:37.611]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:48:38.231 --> 01:48:40.513]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:48:41.133 --> 01:48:47.637]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:48:47.657 --> 01:48:51.199]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:57.864]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:48:58.928 --> 01:49:07.431]  Double down and support the broadcast more than ever to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[01:49:07.631 --> 01:49:16.734]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:49:17.115 --> 01:49:18.355]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:18.375 --> 01:49:19.355]  And I went looking up online.
[01:49:19.756 --> 01:49:20.676]  It is very, very popular.
[01:49:21.256 --> 01:49:23.017]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:49:23.198 --> 01:49:30.122]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:34.586]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:49:34.826 --> 01:49:38.909]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:49:39.409 --> 01:49:47.134]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the courts said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:49:48.235 --> 01:49:49.076]  And they kicked him back.
[01:49:50.337 --> 01:49:53.919]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:49:54.239 --> 01:50:05.386]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:50:05.906 --> 01:50:14.291]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:50:14.851 --> 01:50:16.172]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:16.192 --> 01:50:18.034]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:18.054 --> 01:50:20.096]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:50:20.316 --> 01:50:22.918]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:50:22.938 --> 01:50:23.739]  You'll have a historical memento.
[01:50:37.812 --> 01:50:46.938]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:47.299 --> 01:50:48.620]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:52.182]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:50:52.743 --> 01:50:55.745]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:50:56.105 --> 01:51:00.969]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:51:01.329 --> 01:51:03.431]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:51:04.231 --> 01:51:06.233]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:10.177]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:51:10.217 --> 01:51:10.817]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:51:11.378 --> 01:51:13.560]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:14.361]  That's not what this is.
[01:51:14.381 --> 01:51:15.422]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:51:16.021 --> 01:51:29.129]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:51:29.409 --> 01:51:30.329]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:51:31.050 --> 01:51:35.873]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[01:51:38.490 --> 01:51:41.413]  $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:51:41.473 --> 01:51:44.616]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:51:45.136 --> 01:51:52.824]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:51:53.184 --> 01:51:54.285]  The decision is yours.
[01:51:54.305 --> 01:51:55.727]  This is a limited edition.
[01:51:56.347 --> 01:52:00.729]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:52:01.369 --> 01:52:11.674]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time that myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:52:12.034 --> 01:52:20.937]  So please take action now at InfoWarsStore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars Limited Edition Proprietary 24-Karat 999 Pure Gold Collectible.
[01:52:21.318 --> 01:52:22.178]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:22.538 --> 01:52:24.179]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:32.990]  Alright, I want to play a few clips from Trump with Elon Musk.
[01:52:49.574 --> 01:52:54.175]  We're going to go over it all in this next hour and so much more.
[01:52:54.235 --> 01:53:00.157]  But here are some of the most important clips of Trump saying, hey, I already believe in God, but I believe in God so much more.
[01:53:00.217 --> 01:53:03.198]  Thank God for saving me on July 13th.
[01:53:04.378 --> 01:53:05.438]  A critical juncture.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.400]  Yeah, the clip we're going to play is
[01:53:12.925 --> 01:53:17.749]  I mean, the assassination attempt, which was an incredible thing.
[01:53:17.789 --> 01:53:24.955]  And I have to say that, you know, your actions at that assassination attempt were inspiring.
[01:53:26.396 --> 01:53:33.402]  You know, you, instead of shying away from things, instead of ducking down, you were pumping your fist in the air and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[01:53:33.422 --> 01:53:40.568]  And I think that's, I mean, you know, the President of the United States represents America.
[01:53:40.788 --> 01:53:41.949]  And I think that is
[01:53:43.101 --> 01:53:43.761]  That is America.
[01:53:43.802 --> 01:53:45.302]  That is strength under fire.
[01:53:46.043 --> 01:54:02.613]  And so that's, you know, a big, you know, part of the reason why I was excited to endorse you as the President of the United States for having another term here is that was just incredibly inspiring.
[01:54:02.653 --> 01:54:05.295]  But I mean, what was it like for you?
[01:54:07.049 --> 01:54:13.174]  Not pleasant, I have to be honest.
[01:54:13.754 --> 01:54:15.536]  I didn't know I had that much blood.
[01:54:15.896 --> 01:54:23.181]  The doctors later told me that the ear is a place that is a very bloody place if you're going to get hit.
[01:54:23.882 --> 01:54:33.769]  But in this case, it was probably the best alternative you could even think about because it went at the right angle and, you know, it was a hard hit.
[01:54:33.909 --> 01:54:34.390]  It was very
[01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:37.978]  I guess you would say surreal, but it wasn't surreal.
[01:54:37.998 --> 01:54:46.960]  You know, I was telling somebody you have instances like this or like a lot less than this where you feel it's a surreal situation.
[01:54:47.441 --> 01:54:48.581]  And I never felt that way.
[01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:52.242]  I knew immediately that it was a bullet.
[01:54:52.682 --> 01:54:55.603]  I knew immediately that it was at the ear.
[01:54:55.623 --> 01:54:55.703]  Yeah.
[01:54:56.863 --> 01:54:59.604]  And because it, you know, it hit very hard, but hit the ear.
[01:55:00.884 --> 01:55:02.345]  And I also heard people
[01:55:03.394 --> 01:55:09.558]  Shout bullets, bullets, you know, get down, get down because I, you know, I moved down pretty nicely, pretty quickly.
[01:55:09.598 --> 01:55:12.740]  And we had bullets flying right over my head after I went down.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:13.821]  So I'm glad I went down.
[01:55:14.561 --> 01:55:18.144]  The bigger miracle was that I was looking in the exact direction of the shooter.
[01:55:18.164 --> 01:55:24.628]  And so it hit, it hit me at an angle that was far less destructive than any other angle.
[01:55:24.688 --> 01:55:25.648]  So that was the miracle.
[01:55:25.688 --> 01:55:31.652]  That was, for those people that don't believe in God, I think we got to all start thinking about that.
[01:55:31.712 --> 01:55:32.153]  You have to,
[01:55:33.246 --> 01:55:34.866]  You know, I'm a believer.
[01:55:34.926 --> 01:55:36.527]  Now I'm more of a believer, I think.
[01:55:36.587 --> 01:55:37.907]  And a lot of people have said that to me.
[01:55:37.927 --> 01:55:39.988]  A lot of great people have said that to me, actually.
[01:55:40.648 --> 01:55:45.089]  But it was amazing that I happened to be turned just at that perfect angle.
[01:55:45.929 --> 01:55:51.911]  And all because I put down a chart on immigration that showed that the numbers were so great.
[01:55:52.431 --> 01:55:54.132]  I love that chart even more now.
[01:55:54.152 --> 01:55:55.352]  Maybe it's a sign.
[01:55:55.392 --> 01:55:56.492]  Maybe that's a sign.
[01:55:56.512 --> 01:55:58.933]  It's an immigration sign.
[01:55:58.973 --> 01:56:02.614]  You highlighted a serious issue at that moment.
[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:09.397]  The bullet missed your head.
[01:56:09.437 --> 01:56:14.542]  The amazing thing is that the sign, I said, bring down that sign on immigration.
[01:56:14.643 --> 01:56:19.208]  And it was literally about an eighth of a second where it would be good.
[01:56:19.348 --> 01:56:23.352]  And after that, it was going to be a disaster no matter which way you were facing.
[01:56:23.873 --> 01:56:24.774]  But it just had that
[01:56:25.464 --> 01:56:29.565]  That perfect angle, which was exactly at this shooter.
[01:56:29.925 --> 01:56:31.146]  Very sad situation.
[01:56:31.166 --> 01:56:33.526]  They're coming from the Middle East.
[01:56:33.887 --> 01:56:41.689]  They're coming from countries that are stupidly and horribly bombing Israel, October 7th.
[01:56:42.129 --> 01:56:43.629]  They're coming from all over the world.
[01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:48.511]  And you know, you look at, it's so sad, October 7th, because it should have never happened.
[01:56:48.911 --> 01:56:50.952]  It's so sad when you look at Ukraine.
[01:56:51.192 --> 01:56:52.272]  It should have never happened.
[01:56:52.896 --> 01:56:54.398]  We have a defective government.
[01:56:54.418 --> 01:56:55.739]  These are defective people.
[01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:57.801]  And they're not people that should be running it.
[01:56:58.121 --> 01:56:59.883]  But where you see it the best is the border.
[01:57:17.779 --> 01:57:18.300]  Monday night.
[01:57:19.081 --> 01:57:19.702]  It's Wednesday.
[01:57:20.423 --> 01:57:24.247]  Back in 60 seconds with the new UN pandemic declaration.
[01:57:24.828 --> 01:57:35.081]  Well, this is a broadcast that, other than Trump, is the most demonized thing in the world by the globalists because they hate our guests, they hate our stories, they hate our reports, they hate our analysis.
[01:57:36.042 --> 01:57:39.485]  What the bad guys are doing because the average person tunes in here and it makes a lot of sense.
[01:57:40.106 --> 01:57:41.327]  They then check out our claims.
[01:57:41.367 --> 01:57:43.349]  They find out we're super accurate.
[01:57:43.829 --> 01:57:53.017]  We're certainly trying to tell the truth unlike corporate media and the show just grows as freedom grows and that makes the establishment really mad.
[01:57:53.858 --> 01:58:00.524]  So I could have the archivists do this and we probably should but the last two years I probably said
[01:58:02.182 --> 01:58:02.983]  We're good to go.
[01:58:22.918 --> 01:58:25.920]  I said, since their treaty failed, they're really going to create fear.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:35.646]  So they tried the bird flu and had their PCR test turned up really high the last few months and killed millions of chickens and hundreds of thousands of cows and ran around fear-mongering, but nobody bought into it.
[01:58:37.587 --> 01:58:41.810]  And the FDA and people came out and said, well, we want everybody that works around cows to wear hazmat suits.
[01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:42.550]  Cows are all deadly.
[01:58:42.571 --> 01:58:43.191]  They're going to make you sick.
[01:58:43.211 --> 01:58:44.372]  We were like, give me a freaking break.
[01:58:45.272 --> 01:58:46.153]  It's the same thing with chickens.
[01:58:48.083 --> 01:58:54.468]  So the bird flu didn't work, but they did authorize the shots for that, the mRNA garbage, two weeks ago.
[01:58:55.929 --> 01:58:57.089]  But that didn't create fear.
[01:58:57.150 --> 01:58:59.071]  So they tried monkey pox with stories.
[01:58:59.651 --> 01:59:06.316]  Remember over a year ago, oh, in Pennsylvania, a truck turned over and deadly monkeys, like a horror movie, got out and they got monkey pox.
[01:59:06.356 --> 01:59:07.917]  And then monkey pox is everywhere.
[01:59:07.937 --> 01:59:12.781]  And then it was homosexual men in like New York and San Francisco that have hundreds of partners a month, literally.
[01:59:13.701 --> 01:59:16.443]  And a few of them got this monkey pox
[01:59:17.426 --> 01:59:20.068]  Reportedly from like eating poop or something's how you have to do it.
[01:59:20.088 --> 01:59:28.373]  I mean, I'm not I'm not joking folks Just type in you know gay men monkey pox On the X or something that actually who knows will come up.
[01:59:28.393 --> 01:59:31.215]  But the point is is that that's what's going on
[01:59:32.486 --> 01:59:33.227]  But that didn't work.
[01:59:33.707 --> 01:59:36.109]  So people know monkeypox is already debunked.
[01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:37.870]  So now it's mpox.
[01:59:38.491 --> 01:59:39.852]  Kind of like, oh, there's a new variant.
[01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:42.234]  There's the flirt variant of COVID.
[01:59:42.534 --> 01:59:43.655]  So they're telling you COVID's back.
[01:59:43.675 --> 01:59:44.996]  They're telling you all this stuff's back.
[01:59:45.056 --> 01:59:46.777]  And let me tell you, there's a lot of weird illnesses going on.
[01:59:47.077 --> 01:59:50.400]  They did inject millions of people with experimental stuff that causes other viruses to mutate.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.180]  That's very real.
[01:59:52.401 --> 01:59:53.742]  So there's a lot of weird crap going on.
[01:59:53.762 --> 01:59:54.903]  But we're all eating GMO.
[01:59:54.923 --> 01:59:55.864]  We're in 5G.
[01:59:55.924 --> 01:59:59.307]  I mean, it's just, you know, I'm not saying you shouldn't fortify your immune system and be ready.
[02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:01.271]  Whatever they're going to release.
[02:00:01.331 --> 02:00:02.631]  In fact, more so than ever.
[02:00:03.532 --> 02:00:05.893]  But it's just insane.
[02:00:06.374 --> 02:00:12.257]  So here's Tedros, by the way, who ran the health system in Ethiopia for the communist dictatorship.
[02:00:12.878 --> 02:00:15.179]  Reportedly over a million and a half people died of cholera.
[02:00:15.219 --> 02:00:15.940]  He wouldn't give them aid.
[02:00:17.005 --> 02:00:18.505]  So they're like, well, this guy kills his own people.
[02:00:19.126 --> 02:00:20.846]  We'll just promote him up to the top.
[02:00:21.446 --> 02:00:23.487]  And now he's always saying, censor everybody.
[02:00:23.567 --> 02:00:31.129]  And you heard his mouthpiece say, I met with Tedros, and he agrees we need to use UN troops on Americans to make them take shots during the next lockdown.
[02:00:32.569 --> 02:00:33.610]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:00:33.630 --> 02:00:34.410]  I remember the old timers.
[02:00:35.862 --> 02:00:40.104]  When I was first getting on air 30 years ago, the UN plans to invade, and I'm like, that'll never happen.
[02:00:40.144 --> 02:00:40.924]  No one will put up with it.
[02:00:41.505 --> 02:00:45.086]  They're like, well, here's 7277, and here's the document, 1963, and it was all real.
[02:00:45.447 --> 02:00:46.607]  I'm like, yeah, let them try that.
[02:00:46.987 --> 02:00:48.468]  But see, they don't come with UN helmets.
[02:00:48.488 --> 02:00:55.371]  They come through the medical system and the bureaucracy and a central banking system to track everybody.
[02:00:57.212 --> 02:01:01.934]  So, that's what they've been wargaming, how they're trying to create all this hysteria.
[02:01:02.215 --> 02:01:02.755]  Here's Tedros.
[02:01:04.793 --> 02:01:16.625]  Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public emergency of international concern.
[02:01:17.887 --> 02:01:19.689]  I have accepted that advice.
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:39.395]  The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of Mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported Mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying.
[02:01:40.556 --> 02:01:54.822]  In addition to other outbreaks of other clades of Mpox in other parts of Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.
[02:01:56.243 --> 02:01:57.604]  This is so transparent.
[02:01:59.204 --> 02:02:01.005]  Their global power grab treaty fails.
[02:02:01.986 --> 02:02:04.247]  They're still ramming it through piecemeal, per country, per country.
[02:02:05.587 --> 02:02:07.368]  And now they need more fear.
[02:02:08.308 --> 02:02:09.509]  And so right on time,
[02:02:10.737 --> 02:02:11.717]  It's IMPOX.
[02:02:14.658 --> 02:02:14.979]  Wow.
[02:02:16.099 --> 02:02:18.240]  These guys mean business, don't they?
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:22.481]  WHO declares global emergency over new IMPOX.
[02:02:23.282 --> 02:02:24.462]  Oh, it's not Monkeypox last year.
[02:02:24.522 --> 02:02:25.442]  Now it's IMPOX.
[02:02:28.083 --> 02:02:28.844]  Does that scare you?
[02:02:32.185 --> 02:02:35.106]  All right, now let's get into what I mentioned earlier, but it's a really big deal.
[02:02:36.496 --> 02:03:00.151]  I mean, this story is so big, what's happened is so big, I'm almost pinching myself that we're here in the year 2024, on August 14th, almost Wednesday, talking about a week-long invasion of NATO, that's who's running it, funding it, giving them the weapons, giving them the mercenaries, into Russia, out of Ukraine, to draw Russian forces away from the security line they've created and all the rest of it.
[02:03:01.632 --> 02:03:04.254]  And it's a major escalation, it's a major provocation,
[02:03:06.621 --> 02:03:09.302]  To make it look like Ukraine is going to win this war.
[02:03:09.382 --> 02:03:23.286]  Obviously, Russia is going to organize and it's already been, you know, in major combat with these groups, but they flooded a bunch of well-trained soldiers and drones and armored vehicles and tanks into rural areas, just invading little towns, blowing everything up.
[02:03:23.886 --> 02:03:28.708]  And then the tanks roll out and hide in the woods and the troops hide in the woods and wait for the Russians to come and they kill them.
[02:03:30.299 --> 02:03:36.665]  This is why Russia said they went into Ukraine was the 10 years of destabilization Ukraine and shelling Russian areas on the border.
[02:03:38.186 --> 02:03:44.933]  And contrary to what the media is spinning, this is only going to harden support.
[02:03:46.428 --> 02:03:47.409]  We're good.
[02:04:06.397 --> 02:04:08.118]  NATO's denying that they were involved.
[02:04:08.158 --> 02:04:09.198]  Of course, they're running the whole thing.
[02:04:09.598 --> 02:04:12.820]  Polish soldiers ramp up training for trench warfare and direct war with Russia.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.942]  Putin says Ukraine will receive a worthy response of a Kursk incursion.
[02:04:20.944 --> 02:04:29.647]  Putin accuses Kiev of participating and perpetrating war crimes and vows strong response as Ukraine claims to control almost 400 square miles of Russian territory.
[02:04:30.968 --> 02:04:35.070]  So the headline is Russia invaded by NATO.
[02:04:36.837 --> 02:04:40.038]  First time since World War II, Russia is being invaded on its territory.
[02:04:41.358 --> 02:04:47.159]  Lindsey Graham has been over there, along with Marco Rubio, when the whole attack got launched.
[02:04:48.179 --> 02:04:49.740]  So they're very, very proud of themselves.
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:53.820]  Putin pulls units out of Ukraine in a humiliating retreat from invasion.
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:55.321]  Says the sun.
[02:04:55.341 --> 02:05:00.942]  Ukraine pounds Russia with drones and says it's advancing deeper.
[02:05:01.482 --> 02:05:02.242]  Washington Post.
[02:05:03.652 --> 02:05:06.873]  Ukraine seizes more land in a week than Russia managed in eight months?
[02:05:09.193 --> 02:05:14.215]  Russia has said from the beginning it wants that control area on the eastern part of Ukraine.
[02:05:14.235 --> 02:05:15.475]  It doesn't want to take all of Ukraine.
[02:05:17.555 --> 02:05:19.276]  So, this is so dangerous.
[02:05:19.296 --> 02:05:20.456]  I want to play a couple clips here.
[02:05:21.136 --> 02:05:22.957]  One of them is Biden, clip 12.
[02:05:23.777 --> 02:05:27.558]  First public reaction to Zelensky's attack on the Kursk region.
[02:05:29.478 --> 02:05:31.859]  And then I want to go to a clip of Putin.
[02:05:34.003 --> 02:05:37.926]  Also talking about this as well.
[02:05:38.547 --> 02:05:41.149]  So here are both of those clips.
[02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:45.212]  What do you have to say about what's happening in Russia and Ukraine?
[02:05:45.272 --> 02:05:47.413]  Have you spoken with anyone in the Ukrainian government?
[02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:54.518]  I've spoken with my staff on a regular basis probably every four or five hours for the last six or eight days.
[02:05:55.199 --> 02:06:00.063]  And it's creating a real dilemma for Putin.
[02:06:01.289 --> 02:06:05.972]  We've been in direct contact, constant contact with the Ukrainians.
[02:06:06.112 --> 02:06:08.413]  That's all I'm going to say about it while it's happening.
[02:06:15.529 --> 02:06:31.413]  Positions in the future, but what negotiations could we even talk about with people who are attacking civilians, civilian infrastructure, or trying to create threats or nuclear industry facilities?
[02:06:31.513 --> 02:06:33.093]  What is there to even talk about with them?
[02:06:39.502 --> 02:06:47.473]  And of course, at least four times the last two and a half years, Ukraine has attacked the largest nuclear power plant in the world, the Russians hold there in eastern Ukraine.
[02:06:48.655 --> 02:06:50.878]  And it got blown up again.
[02:06:50.938 --> 02:06:53.682]  Thank God it didn't melt down, but it was on fire for the last three days.
[02:06:54.063 --> 02:06:55.465]  And the media said Putin's doing that.
[02:06:59.346 --> 02:07:05.110]  So, this is all just complete and total absolute crazy town.
[02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:09.333]  I mean, just the headline, NATO forces invade Russia.
[02:07:09.934 --> 02:07:13.517]  The headline, largest nuclear power plant in the world on fire.
[02:07:13.617 --> 02:07:15.378]  I mean, look at it from miles away.
[02:07:15.398 --> 02:07:16.239]  Look at that.
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:19.921]  And it's being missile attacked.
[02:07:19.961 --> 02:07:22.143]  It's being shot by artillery.
[02:07:25.979 --> 02:07:27.740]  And then they turn around and say Putin did it.
[02:07:28.421 --> 02:07:31.383]  Kind of like they said Putin blew up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, right?
[02:07:32.523 --> 02:07:33.524]  Along with the Keebler elves?
[02:07:36.026 --> 02:07:38.667]  So, that's NATO terrorizing everybody.
[02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:45.132]  Ukraine says growing advance into Russia creates buffer zone, Reuters.
[02:07:46.471 --> 02:08:02.678]  So NATO is carving out, you pull up a map of Ukraine and Russia, you've got Ukraine right here and you've got Russia, they're carving out a big piece of Russia to have a war with Russia now in Russia, and Russia said they had to do that because NATO was planning to invade Russia.
[02:08:04.999 --> 02:08:08.501]  So, anybody thinks this is a good idea needs their head examined.
[02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:15.064]  But thank God Trump did not pick his VP, Marco Rubio, or he would be pushing daisies.
[02:08:16.505 --> 02:08:20.788]  I mean, if he would have picked him, they'd have dropped a bomb on Mar-a-Lago.
[02:08:20.848 --> 02:08:23.270]  I mean, they want Marco Rubio in there.
[02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:24.270]  Total warmonger.
[02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:25.311]  Same thing with Lindsey Graham.
[02:08:26.152 --> 02:08:27.933]  Absolutely disgusting people.
[02:08:30.935 --> 02:08:33.697]  And again, these news stories are so dangerous, so insane.
[02:08:34.157 --> 02:08:35.398]  These developments are so horrible.
[02:08:35.678 --> 02:08:39.321]  I don't even... Biggest nuclear reactor in the world on fire.
[02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:40.161]  You see the footage?
[02:08:42.103 --> 02:08:43.344]  NATO invading Russia.
[02:08:43.404 --> 02:08:44.945]  I mean, it's just, it's not even real.
[02:08:46.837 --> 02:08:47.978]  How crazy all of this is.
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:57.307]  And if you think you've seen crazy, what's that song from the 60s?
[02:08:58.288 --> 02:08:59.589]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:09:01.691 --> 02:09:03.573]  Baby, baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:09:05.094 --> 02:09:06.075]  Find the best part of that song.
[02:09:06.115 --> 02:09:06.836]  Let's go out to break.
[02:09:08.037 --> 02:09:10.599]  Hell, 10 minutes from now, 12 minutes from now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:09:10.619 --> 02:09:11.580]  I forget who sings the song.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:15.521]  That's why I'm just so flabbergasted.
[02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:19.963]  I've been sitting back saying, they're going to attack mainland Russia.
[02:09:19.983 --> 02:09:20.924]  They're going to expand that.
[02:09:20.944 --> 02:09:23.005]  They're going to do cyber attacks, open the borders up.
[02:09:24.286 --> 02:09:25.547]  They're going to try to cut the power off.
[02:09:25.567 --> 02:09:26.787]  They're going to try to kill Trump.
[02:09:27.768 --> 02:09:32.451]  And it's all happening because we have psychotics running the country.
[02:09:34.744 --> 02:09:37.105]  I mean, they openly had the Secret Service stand down.
[02:09:37.125 --> 02:09:38.386]  They got caught doing it.
[02:09:38.926 --> 02:09:41.668]  And now we've just moved on to the next story.
[02:09:41.908 --> 02:09:43.468]  Kamala Harris has done no interviews.
[02:09:43.508 --> 02:09:44.569]  She can't even hardly talk.
[02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:48.311]  She cackles like a witch, completely mentally ill.
[02:09:51.272 --> 02:09:56.475]  In the UK, if you say on Facebook, Muslims are raping us, you get 20 months in jail.
[02:09:59.116 --> 02:10:00.597]  And the left's like, we want that here.
[02:10:08.007 --> 02:10:08.428]  Bonkers.
[02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:13.393]  Total cuckoo.
[02:10:16.296 --> 02:10:25.085]  And that's what happens throughout history over and over again, is these empires decide to line up and kill each other, and then we get killed in the process.
[02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:30.410]  All right, I've got...
[02:10:32.194 --> 02:10:39.540]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 stacks.
[02:10:41.182 --> 02:10:43.364]  I haven't gotten to, so let's get going here.
[02:10:45.746 --> 02:10:46.866]  Look at this stack right here.
[02:10:47.207 --> 02:10:48.488]  Ooh, this one is a big one.
[02:10:48.528 --> 02:10:50.610]  This one's really important right here.
[02:10:54.673 --> 02:10:59.417]  Do you know how much money it costs
[02:11:04.853 --> 02:11:18.037]  In just the last year, what it's estimated for next year to cost for the illegal aliens that have been told to go to New York City are being flown there from Texas and California, New Mexico, Arizona.
[02:11:18.057 --> 02:11:20.478]  If you're a radio listener, wait for it.
[02:11:22.798 --> 02:11:27.820]  It's already cost, in the last 12 months, $4 billion.
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:31.581]  The year before that, it cost $3.5 billion.
[02:11:34.343 --> 02:11:36.045]  When Biden first got in, $2 billion.
[02:11:36.686 --> 02:11:49.921]  It is set to top $5 billion, with a B, next year in New York, to take care of the illegal aliens and give them a driver's license.
[02:11:50.022 --> 02:11:50.562]  And here's the key.
[02:11:52.150 --> 02:11:59.276]  Yeah, it gives New York more Democrat apportionment in the census to get more Democrat seats, and then we've had Democrat congressmen and women admit that.
[02:11:59.316 --> 02:12:00.037]  They don't even deny it.
[02:12:00.197 --> 02:12:01.218]  Oh, we're going to win elections this.
[02:12:01.879 --> 02:12:09.225]  Not to mention the illegals voting actually in the election, but they get more blue seats in the jurisdictions they control.
[02:12:11.287 --> 02:12:12.187]  Call that a fake complete?
[02:12:14.670 --> 02:12:15.951]  But the bigger issue here
[02:12:17.233 --> 02:12:29.939]  That's not being covered, I mean, obviously the top issue is the election fraud, is that the NGOs that get State Department money and all the rest of it, they make money and it's a self-repeating process.
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.561]  It's self-renewing, it grows like a cancer.
[02:12:36.323 --> 02:12:44.287]  That these NGOs, there's only, you know, four or five big ones, there's a bunch of little ones, but if you look at like 90 plus percent of the money goes to four or five groups.
[02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:48.171]  That big Jewish charity, the Catholic charities, and a couple others.
[02:12:49.371 --> 02:12:56.353]  But the Catholic and the Jewish charity are as big as each other, and they get like 70% of the money if you add it up.
[02:12:56.773 --> 02:12:58.493]  So even the other big ones are small parts.
[02:12:59.834 --> 02:13:09.536]  And they get diplomatic community, they get all this money, and they do all this, and they just bring in all these people, sign them up for welfare, get them jobs on top of it, skim money through the NGO lawyers.
[02:13:10.556 --> 02:13:12.357]  And just like the left farms homeless,
[02:13:15.948 --> 02:13:23.914]  And, you know, you'll find about some homeless guy that lives in San Francisco or L.A., and you'll learn he's getting $100,000 a year in benefits, but he's only getting like $40,000 himself.
[02:13:23.994 --> 02:13:28.477]  The bureaucracy and the social workers farm them.
[02:13:31.219 --> 02:13:36.843]  And they get in contact with them almost every day, and they call them, they come see them, they bring them food, pat them on the head, and give them some more fentanyl.
[02:13:37.203 --> 02:13:38.744]  But they sign them up for all these goodies.
[02:13:39.744 --> 02:13:40.444]  Oh, you're disabled?
[02:13:40.484 --> 02:13:41.065]  Even more money.
[02:13:41.625 --> 02:13:42.746]  They're farming them.
[02:13:43.206 --> 02:13:49.150]  Not a crop of beef or soybeans or corn or wheat or tomatoes.
[02:13:50.490 --> 02:13:51.731]  It's a crop of people.
[02:13:52.251 --> 02:13:53.932]  Homeless people and illegal aliens.
[02:13:55.393 --> 02:14:00.116]  And the kids being smuggled, disappeared everywhere as the gravy for the pedophiles.
[02:14:01.537 --> 02:14:02.237]  So look at this headline.
[02:14:02.257 --> 02:14:03.818]  It's a huge New York Post article.
[02:14:04.979 --> 02:14:05.879]  Over 20 pages long.
[02:14:05.919 --> 02:14:06.520]  It's excellent.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:07.881]  I suggest you read it.
[02:14:07.901 --> 02:14:08.221]  Here it is.
[02:14:09.855 --> 02:14:21.417]  New York City migrants, you mean illegal aliens, crisis, cost will crack an eye-popping $5 billion on shelter, security, and food, amount could double.
[02:14:23.557 --> 02:14:25.498]  So I'm sorry, I read this earlier and I forgot.
[02:14:27.358 --> 02:14:29.378]  It's gonna be bigger than $5 billion, sorry, it's just $5 billion right now.
[02:14:30.159 --> 02:14:35.059]  So it started out at $2 billion a few years ago, it's up to almost $5 billion, and it's set to double.
[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.920]  And you gotta go read the full report.
[02:14:39.724 --> 02:14:42.945]  And we're talking concierge stuff, because they need to get these folks up here.
[02:14:45.006 --> 02:14:46.826]  They can sign them up and exploit them.
[02:14:47.527 --> 02:14:49.047]  And here's the actual report out of New York.
[02:14:49.948 --> 02:14:56.010]  The Road Forward, a blueprint to address New York City's response to the asylum seeker crisis.
[02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:59.511]  That's why the mayor and the governor says, come here.
[02:14:59.551 --> 02:15:01.411]  But then when people get mad, oh, actually don't come here.
[02:15:01.992 --> 02:15:02.852]  But they want them to come there.
[02:15:08.436 --> 02:15:16.218]  All that's okay, because over in France... France, you know that man that beat up the women and won the gold medal?
[02:15:17.698 --> 02:15:21.019]  A couple men won gold medals over there for beating up all the women.
[02:15:21.239 --> 02:15:22.259]  But he says he's a woman.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:29.381]  France launches probe into alleged cyberbullying of Olympic boxer Imane Khalif.
[02:15:31.702 --> 02:15:32.402]  Scary looking dude.
[02:15:34.437 --> 02:15:35.157]  Britain's proof.
[02:15:35.197 --> 02:15:38.258]  Globalist plan to use migrants as mercenary army against the West.
[02:15:38.358 --> 02:15:38.958]  Excellent article.
[02:15:38.978 --> 02:15:39.478]  Zero edge.
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:46.780]  U.S.
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:51.861]  court reimposes disinformation device monitoring on January 6th defendant.
[02:15:52.161 --> 02:15:53.701]  He walked in the Capitol for one minute.
[02:15:53.761 --> 02:15:54.341]  Hurt no one.
[02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:54.681]  Left.
[02:15:55.241 --> 02:15:58.102]  But he's not allowed to post pro-Trump stuff, the judge says.
[02:15:58.142 --> 02:15:59.042]  That's disinformation.
[02:15:59.962 --> 02:16:00.622]  That's America.
[02:16:00.662 --> 02:16:01.303]  That's not England.
[02:16:02.103 --> 02:16:02.803]  That's going on here.
[02:16:05.339 --> 02:16:12.325]  Like China in 2019, Hong Kong protests, UK government doubles down on threats to catch those involved in immigration protests.
[02:16:13.826 --> 02:16:16.869]  Specialists at UK police teams target hate on social media.

[02:16:26.437 --> 02:16:27.318]  Looks like the sky's blue.

[02:16:34.477 --> 02:16:37.338]  C-U-N-T-S is enchanting.
[02:16:37.639 --> 02:16:38.719]  Who the F is Allah?
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:43.061]  But the Muslims can run around screaming they're gonna kill everybody.
[02:16:43.081 --> 02:16:43.561]  That's okay.
[02:16:44.502 --> 02:16:49.264]  UK's NHS, National Health Service, will now ask men if they are pregnant before x-rays.
[02:16:51.285 --> 02:16:52.726]  Yeah, the mental illness just continues.
[02:16:54.767 --> 02:17:01.290]  Watch live UK's jailing of citizens for free speech coming to America if Harris elected or she's already been selected.

[02:17:05.942 --> 02:17:11.026]  But again, you're not supposed to talk about it, or you go to jail, including journalists.
[02:17:12.847 --> 02:17:14.148]  Tyranny isn't coming, folks.
[02:17:14.368 --> 02:17:14.808]  It's here.
[02:17:16.009 --> 02:17:19.231]  And it's happening all over the Western world, and it's dangerous as hell.
[02:17:21.172 --> 02:17:21.473]  All right.
[02:17:23.514 --> 02:17:25.876]  We're going to break in a few minutes, and I want to come back
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:32.222]  And I want to hit some really important information dealing with the poison shots and Fauci and some of the developments there.

[02:17:45.648 --> 02:17:47.929]  We've also got more on the border.
[02:17:48.689 --> 02:17:52.031]  It turns out it wasn't just Biden killing the DNA testing that was law.
[02:17:53.089 --> 02:17:58.070]  The Trump put in of people that are coming in a little kid with somebody that isn't even their family.
[02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.930]  They test their DNA.
[02:17:59.411 --> 02:18:03.932]  Turns out Biden day one blocked it all when he got in because he want to be able to smuggle those kids.
[02:18:04.592 --> 02:18:06.492]  Very damning information coming up on that.
[02:18:06.952 --> 02:18:09.713]  Also stolen Valor Walls plays victim quote.
[02:18:10.093 --> 02:18:14.134]  You should never denigrate another person's service record.

[02:18:16.014 --> 02:18:16.775]  You're a liar.
[02:18:16.795 --> 02:18:22.436]  All right, we're going to break again for listeners.

[02:18:48.008 --> 02:18:49.508]  I mean, any real formula is this.
[02:18:49.528 --> 02:18:50.849]  This is just the standard best there is.
[02:18:52.335 --> 02:18:53.936]  And ours is really organic and high quality.

[02:19:15.434 --> 02:19:17.335]  And people are like, well, wait, I thought you couldn't order a new product.
[02:19:17.596 --> 02:19:20.398]  The new CRO we have under the federal bankruptcy is letting us order it.
[02:19:22.263 --> 02:19:26.566]  And he told me some interesting things, or told my lawyer some interesting things in the last few days.
[02:19:28.187 --> 02:19:29.388]  But I'm going to do an update soon on that.
[02:19:29.508 --> 02:19:32.370]  But we've got runway out until December now.
[02:19:33.310 --> 02:19:35.011]  And then probably after that, by the grace of God.
[02:19:35.051 --> 02:19:37.733]  But it's, it's, we don't want to take anything for granted.
[02:19:38.393 --> 02:19:40.135]  So it's important we have money to operate.
[02:19:40.655 --> 02:19:42.396]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:44.517 --> 02:19:44.898]  Or 888-253-3139.

[02:19:49.200 --> 02:19:49.721]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:49.741 --> 02:19:50.061]  Stay with us.
[02:19:51.018 --> 02:19:53.999]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360 WIN.
[02:19:54.479 --> 02:19:57.139]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:19:57.519 --> 02:20:02.280]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:08.561]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 WIN.

[02:21:17.133 --> 02:21:19.334]  He ran off from his unit when it came time for war.
[02:21:21.074 --> 02:21:32.519]  But on top of that, tampons in boys' bathrooms, sending in SWAT teams to attack people during the COVID lockdowns, shooting people with paintballs that are on their front porches.
[02:21:33.584 --> 02:21:47.754]  I mean, this guy is a punk, but now he has dozens and dozens and dozens of visits to Communist China for months on end, and people that knew him are saying he collects Mao Zedong paraphernalia and loves Mao Zedong and says we should accept socialism, and that's neighborly.
[02:21:49.795 --> 02:21:52.057]  I mean, this guy is dangerous.
[02:21:53.158 --> 02:21:57.081]  So he says you should never denigrate another person's service.
[02:21:57.121 --> 02:21:59.202]  Well, you're lying about your service.
[02:21:59.222 --> 02:22:00.203]  We're not denigrating
[02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:09.235]  Your service, but at least you're honest about wanting to cut little boys' penises off and wanting to attack people that, you know, sell their porches during COVID lockdowns.
[02:22:11.897 --> 02:22:15.659]  But man, Viva Fry let the cat out of the bag earlier.
[02:22:16.059 --> 02:22:24.925]  The word is, as soon as these guys are locked in coming up the next few weeks at the DNC in Chicago, Trump is going to level their asses, as if they're not already leveled.
[02:22:26.006 --> 02:22:27.967]  But, I mean, these are horrible candidates.
[02:22:27.987 --> 02:22:29.088]  That's why I think Viva Fry's right.
[02:22:29.468 --> 02:22:30.529]  They might kill Kamala.
[02:22:31.323 --> 02:22:33.024]  To try to grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[02:22:33.064 --> 02:22:35.045]  This is a serious time to be alive.
[02:22:35.085 --> 02:22:37.786]  Here he is saying you should never denigrate another person's service.
[02:22:38.806 --> 02:22:41.607]  Then in 2005, I felt the call of duty again.
[02:22:42.128 --> 02:22:44.949]  This time of being service to my country in the halls of Congress.
[02:22:45.669 --> 02:22:47.830]  My students inspired me to run for that office.
[02:22:48.370 --> 02:22:50.031]  And I was proud to make it to Washington.
[02:22:50.751 --> 02:22:55.333]  I was a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee and a champion of our men and women in uniform.
[02:22:55.353 --> 02:22:56.153]  Democrats ripped him off.
[02:22:57.614 --> 02:22:58.835]  Democrats raped the veterans.
[02:22:58.855 --> 02:22:59.395]  We all know that.
[02:23:00.430 --> 02:23:02.371]  I'm going to say it again as clearly as I can.
[02:23:02.391 --> 02:23:04.772]  I am damn proud of my service to this country.
[02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:15.458]  And I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person's service record.
[02:23:16.038 --> 02:23:22.762]  To anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words.
[02:23:23.722 --> 02:23:25.263]  Thank you for your service and sacrifice.
[02:23:31.164 --> 02:23:36.047]  So by that extension, he could say that he's Audie Murphy and has a Congressional Medal of Honor.
[02:23:36.067 --> 02:23:41.271]  And I've never been in the military, so I could just like, oh, I'm, you know, Captain whatever.
[02:23:42.092 --> 02:23:43.152]  These guys are crazy.
[02:23:44.293 --> 02:23:45.754]  But they're desperate.
[02:23:46.455 --> 02:23:47.235]  It's what you'd expect.
[02:23:47.255 --> 02:23:49.637]  But the good news is, people are getting sick of it.
[02:23:49.657 --> 02:23:50.638]  Remember six months ago?
[02:23:52.239 --> 02:23:54.300]  Letitia James persecuting Trump in New York.
[02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:56.261]  She ran on putting Trump in jail.
[02:23:57.498 --> 02:23:58.358]  Soros operative.
[02:23:59.138 --> 02:24:03.439]  She got up in front of the firefighters and it's their right in America to boo.
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:11.921]  And the head of the firefighting group, this woman who probably couldn't even carry a fire extinguisher upstairs, she said, we will hunt you down.
[02:24:11.961 --> 02:24:12.921]  We will fire you.
[02:24:13.261 --> 02:24:17.022]  And they tried to fire people for booing of sack of filth.
[02:24:18.303 --> 02:24:20.383]  Because again, she thinks we're not in America.
[02:24:22.283 --> 02:24:24.424]  She thinks we're in a totalitarian regime.
[02:24:25.506 --> 02:24:35.749]  Fascist Pitbull, FDNY Commissioner, blasted for planning to track down firefighters who booed New York Attorney General Tisha James.
[02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:38.610]  That was back in March.
[02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:41.651]  Well, now she has resigned.
[02:24:46.267 --> 02:24:47.407]  F.D.N.Y.
[02:24:47.448 --> 02:24:50.789]  Commissioner who threatened to hunt pro-Trump firefighters replaced.
[02:24:51.449 --> 02:25:01.313]  The first female fire commissioner of New York City is being replaced by the CEO of a local security firm facing backlash from her own firefighters after she investigated them for heckling the state attorney general.
[02:25:02.353 --> 02:25:02.833]  Well, good.
[02:25:03.613 --> 02:25:04.534]  Fire them all.
[02:25:05.454 --> 02:25:06.114]  Remove them.
[02:25:06.575 --> 02:25:08.955]  Former Commissioner Laura Kavanaugh.
[02:25:08.975 --> 02:25:11.376]  I mean, look at her.
[02:25:11.416 --> 02:25:12.797]  She's like all these globalists.
[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:17.151]  Jacinda Arden's, you know, over in New Zealand.
[02:25:17.391 --> 02:25:21.592]  They just absolutely think we live in North Korea.
[02:25:21.692 --> 02:25:28.553]  And listen, lady, I know you want us to live in a place like that, but we don't yet.
[02:25:30.033 --> 02:25:32.654]  But I go back to what I covered the first hour, because I forgot to hit the stack.
[02:25:32.674 --> 02:25:34.594]  It was the most important to that whole area.
[02:25:35.194 --> 02:25:36.675]  They're everywhere saying Trump's losing in the polls.
[02:25:36.695 --> 02:25:37.355]  Those are fake polls.
[02:25:37.415 --> 02:25:38.775]  I've gone to the methodology of them.
[02:25:40.055 --> 02:25:42.296]  Remember the poll said Hillary was going to win 98% chance of 20 points ahead.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:46.481]  Now they say Kamala's five points ahead.
[02:25:48.002 --> 02:25:49.823]  Trump's continuing to attack on Harris' rise.
[02:25:50.963 --> 02:25:51.724]  Stir fears.
[02:25:52.904 --> 02:25:54.665]  Trump's continuing to attack on Harris' rise.
[02:25:54.705 --> 02:25:55.346]  Stir fears.
[02:25:55.766 --> 02:25:58.247]  He could question election outcome if he loses in November.
[02:25:59.388 --> 02:26:01.109]  Well, Democrats always do that, but he's not.
[02:26:01.649 --> 02:26:03.210]  He's saying she was appointed.
[02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:04.151]  She didn't get one vote.
[02:26:04.451 --> 02:26:05.051]  It's illegal.
[02:26:05.091 --> 02:26:06.292]  He should be pointing that out.
[02:26:07.032 --> 02:26:12.035]  So if they're already selecting her, they're going to try to select her in the election.
[02:26:14.022 --> 02:26:15.303]  Donald Trump press conference.
[02:26:15.343 --> 02:26:17.986]  Former president lashes out at Kamala Harris crowd size.
[02:26:18.366 --> 02:26:19.447]  Attacks her intelligence.
[02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:26.613]  Trump's running against Harris, but he can't seem to stop attacking Biden.
[02:26:27.394 --> 02:26:29.256]  Well, they're the ones that have been wrecking this country.
[02:26:31.298 --> 02:26:32.218]  A different level than 2020.
[02:26:32.519 --> 02:26:34.721]  Trump's plan to steal election is taking shape.
[02:26:34.781 --> 02:26:35.301]  So wait a minute.
[02:26:35.742 --> 02:26:37.924]  They indicted Trump for saying Georgia was stolen.
[02:26:37.964 --> 02:26:39.205]  It came out it was worse than what he said.
[02:26:39.245 --> 02:26:40.326]  Illegals voting and the rest of it.
[02:26:42.418 --> 02:26:44.860]  But now the London Guardian says, no, no, Trump's going to steal it.
[02:26:45.681 --> 02:26:47.763]  So you're not supposed to say elections ever get stolen.
[02:26:48.644 --> 02:26:49.065]  Though the U.S.
[02:26:49.105 --> 02:26:52.388]  government officially came out and said it looks like Maduro stole it, which the evidence is clear he did.
[02:26:53.329 --> 02:26:56.592]  Exit polls were 65% for the other guy, who he's now arresting.
[02:26:58.274 --> 02:26:58.694]  Incredible.
[02:27:00.076 --> 02:27:03.059]  All right, I want to play a short little clip here that's gone viral.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:06.122]  This is a must-see TikTok personality.
[02:27:07.918 --> 02:27:13.619]  Trybiz delivers a powerful history lesson on Republican freedom fighters and Democrats' slavery.
[02:27:14.019 --> 02:27:17.920]  We'll play that clip and then bring in our next guest and more breaking news.
[02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:18.461]  Stay with us.
[02:27:18.481 --> 02:27:22.101]  This is the edition of Let Me Fucking Cook.
[02:27:23.042 --> 02:27:25.602]  Shout out the freedom fighters, the real freedom fighters.
[02:27:25.862 --> 02:27:30.303]  We've always been freedom fighters here in America, the Republican Party.
[02:27:31.024 --> 02:27:32.304]  Shout out Donald J. Trump.
[02:27:33.186 --> 02:27:33.646]  We're good to go.
[02:28:03.390 --> 02:28:08.393]  He set out to free all people, and he was the leader of the Underground Railroad.
[02:28:08.573 --> 02:28:10.474]  I know you're wondering who Harriet Tubman was.
[02:28:11.134 --> 02:28:12.115]  She played the position.
[02:28:12.735 --> 02:28:13.576]  She was not the leader.
[02:28:13.596 --> 02:28:19.839]  Let's also shout out John Brown, who was a conductor, a Republican.
[02:28:19.919 --> 02:28:21.300]  They loved to call him a radical.
[02:28:22.241 --> 02:28:23.581]  He was freeing slaves, too.
[02:28:24.842 --> 02:28:25.963]  And John Brown was hung.
[02:28:27.335 --> 02:28:30.936]  But he was a Republican that didn't want to see us in slavery.
[02:28:31.576 --> 02:28:32.917]  No people.
[02:28:33.017 --> 02:28:34.357]  And did his best to try to free him.
[02:28:34.777 --> 02:28:36.198]  Oh, I'm finding out the truth now.
[02:28:37.018 --> 02:28:39.899]  Republicans didn't want you in slavery.
[02:28:40.259 --> 02:28:42.799]  Democrats did.
[02:28:42.879 --> 02:28:48.321]  So this so-called radical who were helping free slaves was hung.
[02:28:49.001 --> 02:28:50.081]  And guess who was in office?
[02:28:50.442 --> 02:28:51.742]  Mr. Buchanan himself!
[02:28:52.827 --> 02:28:54.868]  And he was a voice for the Democratic Party.
[02:28:55.889 --> 02:29:00.852]  Now, the Democratic Party has an extinct history of fucking you over, colored people.
[02:29:00.972 --> 02:29:11.439]  It's time to wake up and smell not only the coffee, but the ropes, because they've been goddamn tied into knots right now to keep on your neck.
[02:29:11.539 --> 02:29:13.701]  Now, John Brown was called a radical.
[02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:16.481]  The Radical Republican Abolitionists.
[02:29:17.142 --> 02:29:23.903]  And most of these abolitionists that were white, because at this time they weren't letting a lot of colored folks vote, they were Republicans.
[02:29:24.363 --> 02:29:28.304]  And most of the people that was fighting to keep your ass in slavery were Democrats.
[02:29:28.984 --> 02:29:32.425]  All through fucking time, they were people that was fucking you over.
[02:29:32.825 --> 02:29:34.285]  Wanna take a look at Black Wall Street?
[02:29:34.646 --> 02:29:36.666]  For example, Black Wall Street.
[02:29:37.833 --> 02:29:42.074]  Mainly colored folks in America doing good in this specific place.
[02:29:42.914 --> 02:29:45.195]  Was doing great, and they were all Republicans.
[02:29:45.975 --> 02:29:47.295]  But that set out a party.
[02:29:48.015 --> 02:29:48.576]  That's Mr. T.D.
[02:29:48.696 --> 02:29:52.657]  Evans, who was a known Democrat and Klansman.
[02:29:53.177 --> 02:29:55.977]  He was the mayor of Tulsa during those riots.
[02:29:57.258 --> 02:29:57.978]  If you didn't know,
[02:29:58.945 --> 02:30:01.066]  Mr. James B.A.
[02:30:01.507 --> 02:30:01.987]  Robertson.
[02:30:17.316 --> 02:30:21.940]  Why do we sit there and act like these people are so important?
[02:30:45.712 --> 02:30:52.140]  And still the old politicians, especially the Republicans, they still put stock in what the media says, the corporate media.
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:54.743]  You want to be attacked by CNN.
[02:30:55.424 --> 02:30:57.366]  You want to be attacked by ABC News.
[02:30:58.307 --> 02:31:04.294]  It just shows that they've done everything they can to destroy me and demonize me and say all these horrible things that I'm not.
[02:31:05.175 --> 02:31:05.315]  And
[02:31:06.116 --> 02:31:06.816]  It hasn't worked.
[02:31:07.216 --> 02:31:12.798]  Yeah, I lied about WMDs in Iraq and tripled the sanctions that starved two and a half million people to death, a million kids.
[02:31:13.118 --> 02:31:14.219]  Yeah, I opened the borders up.
[02:31:14.319 --> 02:31:15.339]  I shipped the fentanyl in.
[02:31:15.559 --> 02:31:16.699]  I run the giant rape gangs.
[02:31:16.759 --> 02:31:18.220]  I'm starting World War III with Russia.
[02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:20.160]  I'm cutting children's penises off.
[02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:23.281]  Oh no, that's openly, publicly the government and the system.
[02:31:23.682 --> 02:31:24.822]  No, I'm not doing any of that.
[02:31:25.462 --> 02:31:26.703]  And I sure as hell ain't perfect.
[02:31:27.023 --> 02:31:29.105]  But at the end of the day, I love God and I love justice.
[02:31:29.345 --> 02:31:36.030]  And just because you guys twist a bunch of crap and make a bunch of stuff about Elon Musk or Donald Trump or Alex Jones, the dog ain't hunting.
[02:31:44.095 --> 02:31:46.897]  All right, this lady is a real patriot.
[02:31:47.237 --> 02:31:53.101]  She's one of the first doctors to come out when the whole fake pandemic began and expose what was really happening in her big press conferences.
[02:31:54.341 --> 02:31:57.203]  She's a fellow Texan.
[02:31:58.504 --> 02:32:05.508]  She'll be hosting the fourth hour today, but I wanted to get her on for a little while with us up front.
[02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:30.200]  She's also a great sponsor of the operation that keeps us on air, and she has an incredible product line, both of the best supplements, they're amazing, just as good as ours, and she has some different ones that we don't have, and she has a prescription service, and helped tens of thousands, or more than that, hundreds of thousands during the pandemic actually protect themselves, and she's been saying
[02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:32.022]  And if we had enough crew, we'd do it.
[02:32:32.042 --> 02:32:32.622]  It's not the crew's fault.
[02:32:32.642 --> 02:32:33.203]  I forgot to tell them.
[02:32:33.864 --> 02:32:38.489]  You were on six months ago, three months ago, a month ago, saying they're going to declare a new pandemic.
[02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:43.335]  And they've got their emergency authorization for the bird flu, poison shots ready.
[02:32:44.716 --> 02:32:45.757]  They're not calling it monkey pox.
[02:32:45.797 --> 02:32:46.718]  Now it's M pox.
[02:32:47.299 --> 02:32:48.240]  Oh, get the Tedros clip ready.
[02:32:48.260 --> 02:32:48.961]  I'm going to play it again.
[02:32:48.981 --> 02:32:50.863]  The head of the WHO.
[02:32:52.090 --> 02:33:01.058]  He just came out and declared a global emergency to try to ram through their treaty and to create fear ahead of the election with only 80-something days left.
[02:33:01.218 --> 02:33:04.702]  WHO declares global emergency over new Mpox outbreak.
[02:33:04.782 --> 02:33:05.823]  You called it, Doctor.
[02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:05.903]  Yes.
[02:33:07.124 --> 02:33:08.325]  And so here we are.
[02:33:08.685 --> 02:33:10.427]  Dr. Stella Emanuel is our guest.
[02:33:10.467 --> 02:33:12.469]  We'll put her website up on screen.
[02:33:12.489 --> 02:33:14.751]  But first, here's Tedros just an hour ago.
[02:33:16.397 --> 02:33:28.225]  Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public emergency of international concern.
[02:33:29.506 --> 02:33:31.307]  I have accepted that advice.
[02:33:33.021 --> 02:33:51.019]  The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of Mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported Mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying.
[02:33:52.181 --> 02:34:06.399]  In addition to other outbreaks of other clades of Mpox in other parts of Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.
[02:34:09.147 --> 02:34:09.787]  So there you go.
[02:34:09.827 --> 02:34:13.949]  Dr. Sotomayor, you called it months ago that they would declare an emergency ahead of the election.
[02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:14.529]  They've done it.
[02:34:15.589 --> 02:34:17.350]  And you even called it would probably be monkeypox.
[02:34:17.390 --> 02:34:19.371]  Now they're not calling it monkeypox, they're calling it mpox.
[02:34:19.811 --> 02:34:21.332]  Hoping we forget they tried this last year.
[02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:22.032]  What do you see coming?
[02:34:22.711 --> 02:34:30.795]  Yeah, we have monkeypox, we have the flu, which is the COVID, we also have dengue fever, and we have also bird flu.
[02:34:31.256 --> 02:34:34.237]  But yeah, there's a monkeypox outbreak going on right now.
[02:34:34.397 --> 02:34:37.819]  In fact, in Africa, they say in over 80 countries right now, there's a monkeypox outbreak.
[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:42.382]  And I want to tell people, because to me, we heard about monkeypox for a while.
[02:34:42.442 --> 02:34:44.043]  We've been talking about it for now, you know.
[02:34:44.503 --> 02:34:48.066]  And a lot of people say monkeypox is just for people that are like in the gay community.
[02:34:48.146 --> 02:34:48.386]  No.
[02:34:48.766 --> 02:34:53.009]  Yes, it actually affects them more because they are in closer contact in whatever they do.
[02:34:53.449 --> 02:34:58.773]  But actually monkeypox can affect you by just rubbing yourself on the person that has those sores and everything.
[02:34:59.393 --> 02:35:00.634]  And it's going around.
[02:35:00.754 --> 02:35:02.656]  But this is what I want to tell people about monkeypox.
[02:35:03.516 --> 02:35:08.697]  If you go online right now, you're going to Google, there's this thing called pitcher plant sericinia purpura.
[02:35:09.277 --> 02:35:13.738]  It was an old Indian remedy that they used for smallpox.
[02:35:13.818 --> 02:35:23.159]  And a lot of the people that, you know, in America, when America started, a lot of people that had smallpox outbreak, they used the pitcher plant or sericinia purpura.
[02:35:23.519 --> 02:35:31.541]  We actually got one of our naturopathic doctors to produce this in pox defense, that you can help to build your immunity against monkeypox.
[02:35:32.538 --> 02:35:39.440]  For COVID, of course, and bird flu, and even the flu, dengue, they are all mRNA viruses.
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:51.463]  If you just Google dengue fever and hydroxychloroquine, Google COVID and hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, they have several, several, they have a lot of studies that shows that these things work.
[02:35:51.503 --> 02:35:54.943]  So what I try to tell people right now is that please be prepared.
[02:35:55.103 --> 02:36:01.805]  Don't wait till this thing pops up in your house or there's a great thing going on and everybody's getting sick before you get prepared.
[02:36:02.165 --> 02:36:08.191]  So that is why we have put together our telemedicine services that can go all over the country, all 50 states.
[02:36:08.571 --> 02:36:13.636]  Go on our website, DrStellaMD.com, get hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:36:14.096 --> 02:36:21.243]  Go on our marketplace, get pox defense, get COVID vites, so that you can be able to protect yourself.
[02:36:21.744 --> 02:36:24.646]  You know, most of these viruses, they are RNA viruses.
[02:36:24.666 --> 02:36:25.647]  They are sensitive to zinc.
[02:36:26.428 --> 02:36:28.269]  I'm going to talk about it a little more in my next segment.
[02:36:28.549 --> 02:36:31.450]  They are sensitive to zinc, but zinc cannot enter the cell.
[02:36:31.490 --> 02:36:36.512]  So zinc needs like quercetin, elderberry, or hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin to enter the cell.
[02:36:36.952 --> 02:36:41.574]  So most people that eat food, the regular zinc we have in our food cannot come into your system.
[02:36:41.914 --> 02:36:46.255]  So that is why we have supplements that will help open zinc channels and allow zinc into your system.
[02:36:46.515 --> 02:36:47.656]  You can google these studies.
[02:36:48.036 --> 02:36:49.717]  They are all in the NIH, you know.
[02:36:49.737 --> 02:36:52.878]  And they now had to admit you were right and others were right, and others think I was right.
[02:36:53.638 --> 02:36:54.559]  The stuff really works.
[02:36:54.619 --> 02:36:56.700]  But expanding on that, you just got back from Africa.
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:57.981]  You're going to talk more about that next hour.
[02:36:58.141 --> 02:36:58.361]  Yes.
[02:36:58.401 --> 02:36:59.601]  You just spent several weeks there.
[02:37:00.442 --> 02:37:02.223]  How did you predict they'd do a pandemic?
[02:37:02.263 --> 02:37:03.664]  And obviously, there's some real stuff going on.
[02:37:04.064 --> 02:37:07.506]  Is it like COVID where they're releasing it themselves or a new version?
[02:37:07.546 --> 02:37:11.668]  Like, how do they know months ago, oh, bird flu hasn't jumped into humans, but it will soon.
[02:37:11.748 --> 02:37:13.629]  Normally, that takes hundreds of years for it to mutate.
[02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:14.870]  Yes.
[02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:17.892]  If they're predicting and it's happening, are they releasing it?
[02:37:18.092 --> 02:37:37.491]  I mean if you start hearing them talking about it you just have to be able to read because usually I go online and I look at health news worldwide and I see what WHO is saying and since their pandemic treaty did not go through and they're gonna try to do something to disrupt the election and even if they don't if if God does not show us mercy and that lady thing gets get
[02:37:37.711 --> 02:37:38.192]  Black swans?
[02:37:58.195 --> 02:38:04.284]  Before I travel, remember, four days there was no flight because they had this crowd strike thing that affected all airlines.
[02:38:04.585 --> 02:38:09.012]  People just wake up and realize that they are preparing us for these disruptive events.
[02:38:09.352 --> 02:38:11.355]  And what happens after the disruptive events?
[02:38:11.616 --> 02:38:13.378]  You can accept digitalization.
[02:38:14.119 --> 02:38:16.440]  If you just Google, I just traveled all over the world.
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:17.240]  It's so bad.
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:19.741]  In Africa, I was in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda.
[02:38:20.041 --> 02:38:25.023]  There's so much digitalization everywhere, and right now, just you be prepared.
[02:38:25.043 --> 02:38:28.604]  There are people that don't know, Africa, other than China, is ahead of everybody, like Nigeria.
[02:38:28.724 --> 02:38:29.545]  Yeah, Nigeria is crazy.
[02:38:30.225 --> 02:38:31.686]  You don't even know what's happening in Nigeria.
[02:38:31.706 --> 02:38:32.826]  They are starving in Nigeria.
[02:38:33.026 --> 02:38:34.387]  They are trying to bring the mark of the beast.
[02:38:34.427 --> 02:38:36.928]  I'm going to talk a little bit more about Nigeria, what's happening right now.
[02:38:37.308 --> 02:38:42.391]  But everything I want to tell people listening to me is that prepare yourself, prepare your family.
[02:38:42.731 --> 02:38:44.152]  Stock up food, stock up water.
[02:38:44.512 --> 02:38:47.673]  I'm going to talk about over-the-counter medicines you need in an emergency.
[02:38:48.074 --> 02:38:52.716]  Make sure you get prescription medications that you need and you can get your COVID complete pack.
[02:38:53.096 --> 02:38:56.437]  Get the things that you need and start building your immunity.
[02:38:56.458 --> 02:38:59.239]  And by the way, this is a no-brainer and it's not like you just showed up today.
[02:38:59.599 --> 02:39:01.621]  You've been doing this forever, but you've been there day one.
[02:39:02.082 --> 02:39:04.544]  You've got some of the very best products in your medical doctor.
[02:39:04.904 --> 02:39:10.290]  You both have prescription service, and you have this over-the-counter stuff that's second to none, and you're a great sponsor.
[02:39:10.350 --> 02:39:11.171]  That's the Trifecta.
[02:39:11.651 --> 02:39:16.857]  Everybody should use promo code ALEX to get an additional discount at DrStellaMD.com.
[02:39:16.937 --> 02:39:18.779]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:39:18.939 --> 02:39:22.920]  Yes, and please, for your family's sake, be prepared.
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:24.941]  Don't wait until something crazy happens.
[02:39:25.061 --> 02:39:26.522]  Really, please.
[02:39:26.782 --> 02:39:30.043]  Go back to the last pandemic, and it was definitely, people were really sick, people were dying.
[02:39:30.063 --> 02:39:31.303]  You see that package there?
[02:39:31.323 --> 02:39:45.828]  We have this package that has COVID lights, it has monkeypox defense, which will build your immunity against monkeypox, it has the COVID lights that will help you build your immunity against a lot of the viruses, and then it also has potassium iodide, because what if they nuke us?
[02:39:46.428 --> 02:39:49.172]  If they nuke us, you're gonna need potassium iodide to protect your thyroid.
[02:39:49.693 --> 02:39:52.456]  So we have a package there we call, you know, preparedness package.
[02:39:52.737 --> 02:39:56.962]  Preparedness data pack that can actually... By the way, that nuclear reactor, the biggest in the world, is still on fire.
[02:39:57.583 --> 02:39:58.164]  In Ukraine.
[02:39:58.625 --> 02:40:00.227]  Can you believe NATO just invaded Russia?
[02:40:00.948 --> 02:40:01.589]  I can't imagine that.
[02:40:02.395 --> 02:40:05.116]  What do you think Russia is going to do?
[02:40:05.397 --> 02:40:06.817]  Russia is in South America already.
[02:40:06.857 --> 02:40:08.018]  Russia is in the Caribbean already.
[02:40:08.278 --> 02:40:10.339]  They got nuke subs off Miami.
[02:40:10.379 --> 02:40:12.180]  So we really just have to realize that.
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:13.541]  People just wake up.
[02:40:13.761 --> 02:40:14.842]  Wake up America.
[02:40:14.942 --> 02:40:16.322]  Wake up people and realize that.
[02:40:16.983 --> 02:40:18.964]  Right now, just be prepared for whatever.
[02:40:19.384 --> 02:40:20.845]  Make sure you have food and everything.
[02:40:21.065 --> 02:40:22.365]  Make sure if you're locked up in your house.
[02:40:23.606 --> 02:40:25.927]  We're not being fear mongers, we're being realists.
[02:40:26.027 --> 02:40:28.108]  This is the most dangerous time in human history right now.
[02:40:28.128 --> 02:40:28.909]  Why do you think that is?
[02:40:29.768 --> 02:40:30.929]  Ah, because it's the end times.
[02:40:31.149 --> 02:40:36.612]  You know, I tell people your greatest preparedness is to give your life to Jesus because only God can protect us right now.
[02:40:36.992 --> 02:40:38.372]  This is the fight to the finish.
[02:40:38.793 --> 02:40:42.014]  Right now, if Trump, they will do everything to stop Trump.
[02:40:42.094 --> 02:40:43.275]  It's a fight to the finish.
[02:40:43.475 --> 02:40:48.478]  Because they know that if Trump comes in and we have four more years, it's going to disrupt the globalist system.
[02:40:48.718 --> 02:40:52.980]  So there's a war in the heavenlies right now between the devil and God.
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:58.122]  And we human beings are just caught up in the crossfire, but the fight, there's a fight to the finish.
[02:40:58.342 --> 02:41:04.985]  So that's why I tell people, be prepared, spiritually prepared, fiscally prepared, you know, financially prepared, stock up food.
[02:41:05.485 --> 02:41:12.007]  You know, right now with bird flu, Alex, they are actually checking the sewer system to check for COVID and bird flu.
[02:41:12.547 --> 02:41:21.791]  When they are good and ready, they'll just lock down, they'll be like, well, we just check Cooks County, or we just take Rapids County, and there's a lot of bird flu in the sewer, so we can just lock down that county.
[02:41:21.971 --> 02:41:22.911]  They've said that's the plan.
[02:41:23.192 --> 02:41:28.754]  And now we have Tedros and his minions saying, we want UN troops in America for the next lockdown.
[02:41:28.914 --> 02:41:30.115]  They're not saying that for nothing.
[02:41:30.275 --> 02:41:30.915]  They're saying it.
[02:41:31.035 --> 02:41:31.955]  Everybody, they're saying it.
[02:41:32.216 --> 02:41:33.636]  So just wake up and be prepared.
[02:41:34.056 --> 02:41:35.597]  I would tell people to stock up food for a year.
[02:41:35.917 --> 02:41:39.759]  Make sure that if something bad happens, you can stay in your house and not come out of it.
[02:41:40.199 --> 02:41:40.699]  We're good.
[02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:57.551]  Genetically modifying vaccines.
[02:41:57.571 --> 02:41:59.592]  They don't work for the diseases that they say they are.
[02:42:00.033 --> 02:42:01.574]  And I've said it over and over.
[02:42:01.974 --> 02:42:04.676]  COVID was a Trojan horse for the vaccine.
[02:42:05.036 --> 02:42:07.057]  The vaccine is a Trojan horse for transhumanism.
[02:42:07.337 --> 02:42:09.639]  They want by 2025 for everybody.
[02:42:10.259 --> 02:42:12.140]  They want a digital ID to be everywhere by 2025.
[02:42:12.941 --> 02:42:15.122]  And just Google any country right now.
[02:42:15.523 --> 02:42:18.304]  Most countries are at very advanced level in their digital ID.
[02:42:18.545 --> 02:42:19.545]  Like I said, I just traveled.
[02:42:19.565 --> 02:42:23.148]  There were places that they didn't even check my boarding pass or passport.
[02:42:23.308 --> 02:42:25.269]  They just looked at my face and let me on the plane.
[02:42:25.529 --> 02:42:27.130]  This is getting really, really creepy.
[02:42:27.491 --> 02:42:29.532]  So, I'm telling people, be prepared.
[02:42:29.933 --> 02:42:30.633]  Prepare yourself.
[02:42:30.994 --> 02:42:33.556]  We're not scaring you, but if you're prepared, you're not going to be scared.
[02:42:33.636 --> 02:42:38.320]  If you have food and everything, and they try to come after you, come after your family, you can stay home.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.241]  You can sit around and write this.
[02:42:40.281 --> 02:42:41.562]  And of course, guns and ammo.
[02:42:41.602 --> 02:42:44.625]  It's always a good thing to make sure they don't come barging into your house.
[02:42:44.965 --> 02:42:47.788]  I think the only reason that we're really surviving, Alex, is because we have guns.
[02:42:48.388 --> 02:42:49.029]  No, I agree.
[02:42:49.069 --> 02:42:52.091]  I mean, as bad as America is, it's still the best place there is.
[02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:55.574]  People should go to DrStellaMD.com.

[02:43:10.066 --> 02:43:10.646]  Alex, yes.
[02:43:10.787 --> 02:43:11.227]  I'm pleased.
[02:43:11.247 --> 02:43:12.108]  They get what, 10% off or something?
[02:43:12.148 --> 02:43:12.608]  I forget.
[02:43:12.648 --> 02:43:14.710]  Yeah, they get like 5% off with the UD promo code.
[02:43:14.930 --> 02:43:18.092]  We actually have a 40% off running on the COVID Vites that everybody needs.
[02:43:18.432 --> 02:43:19.974]  And if they use Alex, they get an extra 5%.
[02:43:20.054 --> 02:43:20.574]  All right.
[02:43:20.594 --> 02:43:20.874]  So, yes.
[02:43:20.894 --> 02:43:21.215]  So, please.
[02:43:21.235 --> 02:43:21.375]  Okay.
[02:43:21.415 --> 02:43:21.855]  So, there you go.
[02:43:22.175 --> 02:43:27.920]  Right now, telemedicine, do your appointment, get this thing in your medicine cabinet before something crazy happens.
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:31.643]  Get hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin in your medicine cabinet now.
[02:43:32.003 --> 02:43:36.286]  You know, they are, Latisha James in New York is actually trying to block doctors from prescribing ivermectin.
[02:43:36.606 --> 02:43:37.587]  So, what if they stop us?
[02:43:37.667 --> 02:43:40.009]  What if there's a, what if there's a
[02:43:40.009 --> 02:43:42.350]  I hope we're not locked down then, but I'm going to be speaking.
[02:43:57.373 --> 02:43:58.934]  Coming up in late.
[02:43:59.574 --> 02:44:08.059]  I guess it was the 23rd in Pennsylvania with Tucker Carlson, one of his big events so people can find out more about that Tucker Carlson tour.
[02:44:08.459 --> 02:44:12.941]  Join me, Tucker Carlson on his nationwide tour in Reading, PA at the.
[02:44:14.207 --> 02:44:16.969]  Send to your arena on September 23rd.
[02:44:17.009 --> 02:44:20.792]  I look forward to one hell of a show with Tucker Carlson at Tucker Carlson.
[02:44:21.152 --> 02:44:29.117]  Tickets at TuckerCarlson.com VIP and meet and greets at Moms4America.us forward slash Tucker dash VIP TuckerCarlson.com forward slash events.
[02:44:29.558 --> 02:44:35.622]  And I want to see you coming up in Pennsylvania on the 23rd, but stuff so crazy.
[02:44:35.682 --> 02:44:36.662]  I hope we'll even be there.
[02:44:36.823 --> 02:44:37.303]  Dr. Stella.
[02:44:37.737 --> 02:44:38.638]  I hope so, too.
[02:44:39.158 --> 02:44:39.798]  But guess what?
[02:44:39.959 --> 02:44:43.221]  If you cannot go, be able to stay in your house and ride this out.
[02:44:43.621 --> 02:44:49.885]  You know, a lot of people during COVID, if they could just, if they had just ridden it out for a little bit, they wouldn't have had to take the shot.
[02:44:49.925 --> 02:44:52.067]  And a lot of people that took the shot are kind of regretting it right now.
[02:44:52.527 --> 02:44:53.688]  They just did not ride it out.
[02:44:53.928 --> 02:44:55.829]  But you should be ready to ride it out.
[02:44:56.269 --> 02:44:59.291]  Sell some shoes, do a garage sale, sell some of your toys.
[02:44:59.552 --> 02:44:59.892]  Exactly.
[02:44:59.912 --> 02:45:00.632]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:45:00.672 --> 02:45:01.653]  You're going to come back and host.
[02:45:01.673 --> 02:45:02.474]  You can stay right in that seat.
[02:45:02.494 --> 02:45:04.895]  We're going to change cameras onto you, Dr. Stella.
[02:45:04.915 --> 02:45:07.117]  And then in one hour, Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:45:07.157 --> 02:45:07.497]  Central.
[02:45:08.137 --> 02:45:08.417]  Awesome.
[02:45:09.177 --> 02:45:13.158]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:45:13.178 --> 02:45:15.959]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:45:15.979 --> 02:45:20.200]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:22.641]  Because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:45:23.181 --> 02:45:27.802]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:45:28.502 --> 02:45:40.051]  We were basically sabotaged and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product even though there was plenty of money at the time to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:45:40.652 --> 02:45:45.556]  But by the grace of God years ago, I set up backup supplement line
[02:45:45.996 --> 02:45:49.438]  from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:45:49.879 --> 02:45:59.025]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled, and others are different formulas this company offers.
[02:45:59.345 --> 02:46:00.365]  They're all top of the line.
[02:46:00.385 --> 02:46:01.426]  They're already best sellers.
[02:46:01.726 --> 02:46:05.329]  They're already all over the market and in stores and online under other names.
[02:46:05.569 --> 02:46:07.170]  But they are all the very best.
[02:46:07.650 --> 02:46:09.752]  So this line is called InfoWars MD.
[02:46:10.772 --> 02:46:12.493]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:46:12.853 --> 02:46:16.495]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:46:16.915 --> 02:46:19.456]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:46:19.976 --> 02:46:22.857]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:46:23.237 --> 02:46:25.098]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:46:25.118 --> 02:46:26.859]  It's so good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
[02:46:27.219 --> 02:46:29.320]  It is the exact same formula.
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:31.141]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[02:46:31.441 --> 02:46:32.642]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[02:46:32.922 --> 02:46:36.344]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[02:46:36.384 --> 02:46:41.367]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mankiewicz and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:46:41.827 --> 02:46:44.148]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[02:46:44.168 --> 02:46:50.252]  You want to check out the line of InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:46:50.872 --> 02:46:52.835]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:46:52.935 --> 02:46:54.136]  I need you to take action.
[02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:55.578]  You will love these products.
[02:46:55.818 --> 02:46:57.140]  They work really, really good.
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:07.392]  No matter which one you try, they're already top-of-the-line, tested, private-labeled by us, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD label.
[02:47:07.612 --> 02:47:08.393]  Thank you for your support.

[02:47:46.003 --> 02:47:49.425]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.

[02:47:51.867 --> 02:47:53.148]  Superfood greens.

[02:47:54.109 --> 02:47:55.511]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:47:56.031 --> 02:47:58.653]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:47:58.753 --> 02:47:59.754]  Superfood greens.
[02:48:00.195 --> 02:48:01.136]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:48:01.256 --> 02:48:03.678]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:48:03.698 --> 02:48:04.699]  You might not like eating them.
[02:48:04.739 --> 02:48:07.862]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:48:07.882 --> 02:48:09.924]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:48:10.484 --> 02:48:11.404]  And get all the benefits.
[02:48:11.444 --> 02:48:16.265]  Mushroom Maxx, Better Mood Plus, Libido RX, Turmeric 95.
[02:48:16.466 --> 02:48:18.646]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:48:19.026 --> 02:48:23.347]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:48:23.387 --> 02:48:26.788]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just notice when you're not taking it.
[02:48:27.088 --> 02:48:34.050]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:48:35.130 --> 02:48:36.532]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:36.892 --> 02:48:37.713]  I noticed the difference.
[02:48:37.753 --> 02:48:38.614]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:48:38.634 --> 02:48:40.556]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:48:40.876 --> 02:48:42.918]  But that's why turmeric is so important.
[02:48:42.958 --> 02:48:44.220]  Turmeric 95, 25% off.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:46.402]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:48:46.502 --> 02:48:47.683]  The prostate support.
[02:48:48.123 --> 02:48:49.224]  Very important for men.
[02:48:49.745 --> 02:48:50.526]  Nerve Renew.
[02:48:50.766 --> 02:48:52.227]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:48:52.468 --> 02:48:53.489]  Both of those things are key.
[02:48:53.529 --> 02:48:54.630]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:48:54.810 --> 02:48:57.552]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:48:57.812 --> 02:48:58.492]  Good night's sleep.
[02:48:58.992 --> 02:49:04.736]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:04.856 --> 02:49:06.136]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:49:06.657 --> 02:49:08.418]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:49:15.922 --> 02:49:17.863]  So I'm going to talk a little bit about everything.
[02:49:18.023 --> 02:49:21.425]  As you guys know, I'm also a woman of science and a woman of the spirit.
[02:49:21.965 --> 02:49:23.926]  So right now, let's see what's going on.
[02:49:24.267 --> 02:49:32.211]  Of course, we talked earlier about a growing monkeypox outbreak in Africa, first health emergency monkeypox outbreak.
[02:49:32.511 --> 02:49:34.272]  So what is monkeypox?
[02:49:34.432 --> 02:49:37.294]  Of course, this virus is spreading around.
[02:49:37.694 --> 02:49:41.036]  It's part of the pox family, like smallpox or chickenpox.
[02:49:41.616 --> 02:49:45.179]  And if you've had chicken pox, you actually will have a bit of immunity against monkey pox.
[02:49:45.699 --> 02:49:48.622]  But I would tell people, this is what to do about monkey pox.
[02:49:48.682 --> 02:49:52.505]  Number one, if you see somebody that has a lot of sauce on them, please don't touch them.
[02:49:53.005 --> 02:49:57.289]  Because monkey pox, it is not spread by sneezing on someone.
[02:49:57.589 --> 02:50:00.652]  It is actually spread by when the liquid from the person's body touches you.
[02:50:01.212 --> 02:50:02.133]  So that's number one.
[02:50:02.573 --> 02:50:07.376]  Number two is I would advise people to build their immunity against monkeypox.
[02:50:07.536 --> 02:50:11.038]  We started talking about this two years ago when they tried to bring it in America.
[02:50:11.359 --> 02:50:17.943]  But now that Tedros has declared it a public health emergency, I think people need to take it more seriously.
[02:50:18.744 --> 02:50:20.965]  We have done something called Pox Defense.
[02:50:21.065 --> 02:50:22.066]  It's a herbal supplement.
[02:50:26.869 --> 02:50:35.395]  This is a plant that the Indians, the American Indians used in the days of smallpox outbreaks, and they used this plant.
[02:50:35.795 --> 02:50:36.856]  The plant looks like a pitcher.
[02:50:36.876 --> 02:50:38.257]  You can actually grow it in many parts.
[02:50:38.297 --> 02:50:39.618]  It's a very sensitive plant to grow.
[02:50:39.998 --> 02:50:41.519]  We tried to grow it down here in Texas.
[02:50:41.559 --> 02:50:42.279]  It didn't work out.
[02:50:42.619 --> 02:50:46.300]  But I had a friend that was able to grow it in the north and she was able to harvest it.
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:47.620]  It's called pox defense.
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:49.901]  The little black bottle is called pox defense.
[02:50:49.921 --> 02:50:54.302]  So you need to use that to build your immunity against monkey pox.
[02:50:54.903 --> 02:50:59.204]  And if you can grow it, if you can order it, you can actually order the seeds and grow it in your house.
[02:50:59.764 --> 02:51:04.946]  And if you want to grow it for yourself, you can use it in a tea or in a supplement to kind of build your immunity.
[02:51:05.346 --> 02:51:19.470]  I always say, one of the things that we've been doing is, before they bring anything, we try to go on the NIH website and start looking for studies that have been done about them and see what we can put together as supplements that can help people overcome some of the things that they are bringing.
[02:51:20.050 --> 02:51:23.352]  And then of course, we also have the flood virus, COVID flood.
[02:51:24.912 --> 02:51:26.873]  That's the summer virus right now.
[02:51:27.233 --> 02:51:29.594]  They say it's really spreading in about 80 countries right now.
[02:51:29.634 --> 02:51:32.235]  They've not had an outbreak like this since 2022.
[02:51:32.856 --> 02:51:42.180]  But, of course, I'm going to give you the good news, because this flood virus, even though it's causing sickness, like most COVID does, not as many people are dying from it like before.
[02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:47.483]  I think it's because COVID is now endemic, so most people have some kind of immunity to COVID.
[02:51:47.863 --> 02:51:52.425]  But while I would still advise people to make sure that they are taking vitamin C, D, zinc, and quercetin,
[02:51:52.885 --> 02:52:05.674]  To kind of stop COVID, flu, dengue and all these viruses is so that we don't deal with what we call COVID long symptoms because sometimes people get COVID and then they have these COVID long symptoms that affects them for a little while.
[02:52:06.155 --> 02:52:17.483]  But I will not, I would say do not be scared, do not be terrified about it because even though it's still causing sickness and disease, just they say out of about 400 people that catch COVID in Michigan State, only one person died.
[02:52:17.983 --> 02:52:19.844]  So I know that one out of 400
[02:52:21.417 --> 02:52:26.661]  It's not major, as if it was more, but one death is too much.
[02:52:26.801 --> 02:52:33.387]  So I'll just advise people, build your immunity against COVID by making sure you're taking vitamin C, D, zinc, and quercetin.
[02:52:33.407 --> 02:52:37.350]  We have it in COVIDVITES, or you can take it anywhere you can get it.
[02:52:37.390 --> 02:52:42.914]  But make sure that you build your immunity against COVID, flu, RSV, they are all RNA viruses.
[02:52:43.054 --> 02:52:46.597]  And as long as you build your immunity, your family can be protected.
[02:52:46.657 --> 02:52:48.279]  We have been doing this for four years.
[02:52:48.959 --> 02:52:55.661]  I think one of the greatest things that I have really learned in these past four years is to just be able to bring medicine and naturopathic medicine together.
[02:52:56.002 --> 02:52:57.042]  So that's what I'll tell people.
[02:52:57.202 --> 02:52:58.082]  Be prepared for that.
[02:52:58.502 --> 02:53:04.304]  I'm going to come back and talk about dengue and talk about a few other things that are coming that they are trying to release.
[02:53:04.665 --> 02:53:05.365]  But remember,
[02:53:06.025 --> 02:53:06.826]  Thank you.
[02:53:23.302 --> 02:53:23.702]  I think so.
[02:53:43.664 --> 02:53:45.745]  At least it's better to be safe than sorry.
[02:53:45.825 --> 02:53:53.349]  If you hear that it's gonna rain, it's better to come out of your house with an umbrella, then it doesn't rain, than to wait till it rains and then you start looking around for an umbrella.
[02:53:53.729 --> 02:53:57.691]  So like I said, if you go to drstellaimd.com, we have everywhere for you to get prepared.
[02:53:58.151 --> 02:54:00.753]  I'll be back very soon to talk a little more about what's going on.
[02:54:01.073 --> 02:54:02.213]  Hey America, I'm back!
[02:54:02.493 --> 02:54:04.775]  Dr. Stella Emmanuel hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:04.855 --> 02:54:07.176]  Like I said, my segment is Bible Science and Current Events.
[02:54:07.896 --> 02:54:09.598]  So, we talked about monkeypox earlier.
[02:54:09.618 --> 02:54:14.743]  Another thing that I think I've been reading about a lot is dengue fever.
[02:54:15.644 --> 02:54:18.708]  Dengue fever is also a virus, too.
[02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:25.975]  Dengue fever usually takes place in Africa, but there's an increased risk of dengue fever viruses in the United States.
[02:54:26.596 --> 02:54:36.243]  Okay, the CDC is announcing in June 25 that we have a lot of outbreak of dengue fever in America.
[02:54:36.403 --> 02:54:38.764]  Dengue fever is actually transmitted by a mosquito.
[02:54:39.385 --> 02:54:44.048]  So, I'm kind of worried because of this Bill Gates mosquito thing that he keeps doing.
[02:54:44.088 --> 02:54:47.490]  He keeps releasing genetically modified mosquitoes.
[02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:54.435]  So, diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes are now coming into our radar, which is not supposed to be that way.
[02:54:55.035 --> 02:55:01.040]  So, the good thing about dengue fever is that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin also helps to treat dengue fever.
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:06.944]  So that's why I keep going back to everybody, make sure that you stock up on ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:55:07.985 --> 02:55:09.086]  Now, it's a virus.
[02:55:09.306 --> 02:55:11.087]  We have the bird flu, all right?
[02:55:11.387 --> 02:55:11.588]  Now,
[02:55:12.737 --> 02:55:15.217]  America, we've been having this dance.
[02:55:15.337 --> 02:55:17.238]  The CDC has been doing this dance with bird flu.
[02:55:17.998 --> 02:55:28.420]  I always feel as if it was like in the beginning of COVID, where they started with, oh, somebody ate bad soup, you know, in a market in Wuhan, China, and then it jumped to human beings.
[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:34.381]  It takes maybe many, many years for a virus to jump from one species to another.
[02:55:34.741 --> 02:55:41.002]  But somehow they believe that bird flu is going to jump straight to human beings, from birds to cows to chicken,
[02:55:42.361 --> 02:55:57.344]  The thing with the bird flu outbreak is that they can use bird flu not just to be able to give us vaccines, because right now Moderna has already been given millions of dollars to create the bird flu mRNA vaccine.
[02:55:58.424 --> 02:56:00.284]  But bird flu is not just about vaccines.
[02:56:00.845 --> 02:56:08.026]  Bird flu also affects our food supply, because right now they've killed tens of thousands of chickens
[02:56:09.258 --> 02:56:11.058]  Just by testing them for bird flu.
[02:56:11.458 --> 02:56:16.659]  You know, one of the doctors, Dr. Bird, remember this calf lady during the Trump administration?
[02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:18.940]  She said that they should test every cow.
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:26.261]  So they can use bird flu to come after our cows, come after our chicken, come after our food supply because of bird flu.
[02:56:26.301 --> 02:56:28.962]  In fact, they still can be transmitted right now to cats.
[02:56:29.342 --> 02:56:33.943]  So even your, you know, your feline friends in your house can be taken out because of bird flu.
[02:56:34.463 --> 02:56:40.347]  So they are actually checking the sewer system in most counties right now for bird flu and COVID.
[02:56:40.687 --> 02:56:44.810]  So what happens when they are ready to throw out their pandemic?
[02:56:45.170 --> 02:56:54.156]  They will just say that, well, maybe Cook County or, you know, or maybe, you know, Harris County, there's a high level of bird flu, and then they can just stop and lock down the whole place.
[02:56:54.496 --> 02:56:55.637]  And people will not know what to do.
[02:56:56.678 --> 02:56:58.159]  Bird flu is also a virus.
[02:56:58.319 --> 02:57:00.520]  All these things that I'm talking about, they are RNA viruses.
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:03.983]  Whether it's dengue, whether it's bird flu, pox, they are all RNA viruses.
[02:57:04.843 --> 02:57:09.645]  I am so happy about this information about RNA viruses.
[02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:11.865]  You know, the late Dr. Zelenko talked about it a lot too.
[02:57:12.165 --> 02:57:12.866]  God bless his soul.
[02:57:14.686 --> 02:57:18.287]  I grew up, you know, I grew up as a doctor.
[02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:21.528]  I've been practicing medicine and all I did was just do medication.
[02:57:21.829 --> 02:57:26.350]  But the past four years has taught me that medicine is not just about giving people medications.
[02:57:26.410 --> 02:57:27.910]  It's also about health.
[02:57:28.031 --> 02:57:29.071]  It's also about helping people
[02:57:29.671 --> 02:57:32.392]  Build your immunity against some regular viruses.
[02:57:32.712 --> 02:57:36.252]  You know, we never even knew that flu could be treated.
[02:57:36.592 --> 02:57:41.333]  But right now, with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, flu is also an RNA virus.
[02:57:41.853 --> 02:57:43.654]  RSV, all these things are RNA viruses.
[02:57:43.974 --> 02:57:49.455]  We now realize from all these stupid pandemics that they are trying to throw at us, that flu is actually treatable.
[02:57:50.055 --> 02:57:54.696]  RSV, monkeypox, dengue, all these viruses are RNA viruses.
[02:57:54.756 --> 02:57:55.956]  They are sensitive to zinc.
[02:57:56.596 --> 02:57:58.317]  I cannot stop saying this.
[02:57:58.397 --> 02:57:59.337]  They are sensitive to zinc.
[02:57:59.857 --> 02:58:06.319]  But the issue is that the human body cannot uptake the zinc we eat in our food or the zinc you take in supplements.
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:10.961]  So you need a zinc ionophore or something that will open zinc channels.
[02:58:11.381 --> 02:58:13.062]  That is where quercetin comes in.
[02:58:13.102 --> 02:58:15.303]  Quercetin is an over-the-counter medication.
[02:58:15.323 --> 02:58:17.183]  You can actually just get it over-the-counter.
[02:58:17.203 --> 02:58:18.284]  You can order it anywhere.
[02:58:18.604 --> 02:58:21.925]  You know, things like quercetin, elderberry, they are all zinc ionophores.
[02:58:22.365 --> 02:58:35.815]  We have it on our website called Covivite that has vitamin C, D, Zinc and Quercetin put together and I'm telling you we've saved countless lives by just helping people to build their immunity against these viruses so that at least they have a fighting chance.
[02:58:36.295 --> 02:58:37.056]  And guess what?
[02:58:37.596 --> 02:58:42.800]  This study about Zinc, I actually got it off the NIH website because I like to do that.
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:55.450]  When they said monkeypox was coming, I just went on the NIH website and I put studies on monkeypox, possible treatments, and I found out about Sericinia purpura, which is a pitcher plant that can actually help monkeypox.
[02:58:55.510 --> 02:59:01.335]  So, I called some of my naturopathic doctors, I said, put together something, and they put together Pox Defense.
[02:59:01.675 --> 02:59:04.838]  This is what we call it, Pox Defense, that can help you build your immunity.
[02:59:05.318 --> 02:59:11.764]  This is not treatment, I'm not your doctor, so don't, the only time I can give you that specific medical advice is if you sign up for our
[02:59:13.705 --> 02:59:20.269]  But this is just supplements that can help you build your immunity against most of these viruses that they are about to release.
[02:59:21.369 --> 02:59:28.374]  And the other thing that I've learned a lot is actually just about health-wise is medicinal herbs.
[02:59:28.874 --> 02:59:29.934]  You know, moringa.
[02:59:30.115 --> 02:59:31.015]  We actually have it right now.
[02:59:31.035 --> 02:59:37.239]  Moringa, ginger, lemongrass, turmeric, mint, spirulina.
[02:59:39.446 --> 02:59:43.328]  During the winter, I would just make teas from ginger and moringa.
[02:59:43.549 --> 02:59:45.830]  These are spices and herbs that we use.
[02:59:46.330 --> 02:59:47.231]  So look at them.
[02:59:47.311 --> 02:59:51.394]  Look them up and start taking these herbs that can help you build your immunity.
[02:59:51.774 --> 02:59:55.196]  One of the biggest problems that we have in America right now is that we're not healthy.
[02:59:55.617 --> 02:59:56.457]  So try to do that.
[02:59:56.497 --> 02:59:57.698]  And of course, exercise.
[02:59:57.778 --> 02:59:58.439]  Go outside.
[02:59:58.859 --> 02:59:59.539]  Eat healthy.
[02:59:59.900 --> 03:00:02.782]  You know, I've been doing a lot of stuff right now.
[03:00:03.542 --> 03:00:27.584]  losing weight and stuff like that just you know cut down on your weight because I know how it is when you're not healthy that's when this virus is actually will hit you so America just listen start learning to take responsibility for your own health the another thing that I would try to tell people right now to is preparedness health wise is please go to the market go to the store go to the supermarket and get
[03:00:28.928 --> 03:00:31.350]  Over-the-counter medications you will need in an emergency.
[03:00:32.431 --> 03:00:34.492]  Everywhere, get over-the-counter medicines.
[03:00:34.532 --> 03:00:36.474]  Get things like Tylenol.
[03:00:37.154 --> 03:00:38.075]  I know people are like, Tylenol?
[03:00:38.115 --> 03:00:38.555]  No, no, no.
[03:00:38.575 --> 03:00:40.577]  I don't want to take any big pharma medicine.
[03:00:40.637 --> 03:00:47.162]  I'm still a physician, so the fact that I'm talking about herbal supplements and everything doesn't mean that I'm no longer a physician.
[03:00:47.182 --> 03:00:48.963]  I'm just going to write off all medications.
[03:00:49.063 --> 03:00:52.266]  After all, if you have a urine infection, you need an antibiotic.
[03:00:52.686 --> 03:00:53.226]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:00:53.286 --> 03:00:57.428]  If you have a cut on your skin, you need to be able to clean that cut.
[03:00:57.448 --> 03:00:59.229]  You need to apply antibiotics.
[03:00:59.269 --> 03:01:01.310]  You need to have band-aids to use.
[03:01:01.690 --> 03:01:06.292]  If you were to fall and sprain your leg, you're going to need to have ACE bandages.
[03:01:06.312 --> 03:01:07.953]  You're probably going to need maybe crutches.
[03:01:08.313 --> 03:01:11.374]  So one of the things that I try to tell people right now is that go to the website.
[03:01:11.874 --> 03:01:14.936]  No, go online or go to Walmart or wherever.
[03:01:15.416 --> 03:01:19.980]  Put together a first aid box over-the-counter medicines that you can use in an emergency.
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:35.313]  If you go on my Twitter space, Stella underscore Emmanuel, I have a Twitter space that I really did about over-the-counter medicines that you will need in an emergency, so that you can put together a solid first aid box in case something crazy happens.
[03:01:35.714 --> 03:01:39.297]  You don't want to be hiding in your house, then you have a urine infection, you don't know what to do or
[03:01:39.637 --> 03:01:45.809]  You have a skin infection or you have like maybe a spider bite and then you absolutely don't have any way of helping yourself.
[03:01:46.229 --> 03:01:50.978]  So I'm trying to teach people to become prepared and have that preparedness mindset.
[03:01:51.977 --> 03:01:55.079]  Like I said, I think everybody needs to get paranoid.
[03:01:55.159 --> 03:02:00.562]  It's only those that are paranoid in this season that will survive the craziness that is coming into our world.
[03:02:01.082 --> 03:02:02.783]  And I'm not saying this to scare you.
[03:02:02.863 --> 03:02:07.385]  I'm saying this to get you prepared so that you are ready if something happens.
[03:02:07.445 --> 03:02:07.986]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:02:08.826 --> 03:02:09.927]  And get prepared.
[03:02:10.247 --> 03:02:11.607]  Stock up food and water.
[03:02:12.648 --> 03:02:13.849]  Do a garage sale.
[03:02:14.089 --> 03:02:14.750]  I always say that.
[03:02:14.770 --> 03:02:15.450]  Do a garage sale.
[03:02:15.791 --> 03:02:20.975]  Sell off some of your shoes and Prada bags and sell off some of your toys and stock up food.
[03:02:21.135 --> 03:02:23.777]  Beans, rice, you know, like, you know, nuts.
[03:02:23.957 --> 03:02:25.819]  Things that are of high nutritional value.
[03:02:26.139 --> 03:02:28.501]  That if something happens, you and your family can survive.
[03:02:28.581 --> 03:02:30.663]  If they lock us down right now, what are you gonna do?
[03:02:31.063 --> 03:02:35.547]  We have seen it like in Texas here that we've had a few hurricanes or a few weather events pass by.
[03:02:36.027 --> 03:02:38.688]  We're just two days away from the grocery stores being empty.
[03:02:38.908 --> 03:02:39.488]  Just two days!
[03:02:39.809 --> 03:02:42.790]  And the grocery stores are empty, you don't have water, you don't have anything.
[03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:47.572]  So, make sure that if they're going to crash the system, that you can survive.
[03:02:48.092 --> 03:02:52.014]  And you know, some of you are going to be like, come on Dr. Stella, what do you mean by they're going to crash the system?
[03:02:52.614 --> 03:02:54.695]  They have a plan to crash the system.
[03:02:55.715 --> 03:03:01.078]  Because that is the only way they think they're going to be able to make us take their digital ID.
[03:03:01.478 --> 03:03:05.620]  I'm sure a lot of you that are watching this show know a lot of the things that the globalists are planning.
[03:03:06.061 --> 03:03:06.761]  You know about Agenda 2025.
[03:03:06.841 --> 03:03:07.141]  By 2020, Agenda 2030.
[03:03:07.181 --> 03:03:09.522]  But by 2025, they want every country to be digitalized.
[03:03:09.562 --> 03:03:10.123]  We know that.
[03:03:14.665 --> 03:03:18.530]  So, they want that by 2030 all of us should be digitalized.
[03:03:18.791 --> 03:03:20.192]  All of us should have a chip in our skin.
[03:03:20.733 --> 03:03:22.375]  So, you're not going to accept that.
[03:03:22.475 --> 03:03:23.397]  I'm not going to accept that.
[03:03:23.537 --> 03:03:24.878]  Many people are not going to accept that.
[03:03:25.159 --> 03:03:30.606]  The only way that they're going to try to get the weak-minded people to accept this digitalization
[03:03:31.687 --> 03:03:31.787]  It's
[03:03:52.551 --> 03:03:55.132]  We have this mindset that we are in the end times.
[03:03:55.192 --> 03:04:01.136]  We're in a time when the kings of the world or the elites have taken counsel against us.
[03:04:01.236 --> 03:04:02.516]  The Bible talks about it in Psalm 2.
[03:04:02.557 --> 03:04:04.778]  They've taken counsel against the world.
[03:04:04.818 --> 03:04:06.739]  They look at you and I like sheep or cattle.
[03:04:07.079 --> 03:04:08.860]  They don't think that we're worth living.
[03:04:08.920 --> 03:04:13.783]  They think that they can tell us what to do or they can cheap us and just control us like little minions.
[03:04:14.483 --> 03:04:23.685]  So you have to understand that, and not just understand it as head knowledge, but bring it down as heart knowledge, and prepare yourself to survive.
[03:04:24.125 --> 03:04:27.106]  You know, if you prepare to survive, then you will not be scared.
[03:04:27.246 --> 03:04:32.367]  If you know that, okay, you know what, push come to shove, I stay in my house for a year, then you will not be scared.
[03:04:32.387 --> 03:04:35.788]  I advise people, try and stock up food for about a year, you know,
[03:04:36.952 --> 03:04:38.713]  So number one, you're going to be spiritually prepared.
[03:04:38.793 --> 03:04:42.135]  I'm going to, in this last segment, I'm going to talk about spiritual preparedness.
[03:04:42.155 --> 03:04:44.757]  You're going to be spiritually prepared, give your life to Jesus.
[03:04:44.897 --> 03:04:46.137]  I'm a preacher of the gospel.
[03:04:46.658 --> 03:04:49.199]  This last day battle is between Jesus and the devil.
[03:04:49.599 --> 03:04:52.321]  And whether you like it or not, you're going to choose sides.
[03:04:52.481 --> 03:04:54.122]  There's not going to be any middle ground.
[03:04:54.162 --> 03:04:56.183]  You're not going to have to decide that, well, I don't want Jesus.
[03:04:56.223 --> 03:04:57.064]  I don't want the devil either.
[03:04:57.084 --> 03:04:58.104]  I'm just going to be by myself.
[03:04:58.464 --> 03:04:59.045]  It's not going to happen.
[03:04:59.665 --> 03:05:00.906]  You either choose Jesus or the devil.
[03:05:00.986 --> 03:05:02.647]  If you don't choose God, the devil will have you.
[03:05:03.027 --> 03:05:04.988]  So, I tell people, give your life to Jesus.
[03:05:05.088 --> 03:05:07.890]  Make sure that you write with God, read the Bible, know God for yourself.
[03:05:08.050 --> 03:05:11.533]  Make sure that when something crazy happens, you can call on Jesus, number one.
[03:05:11.933 --> 03:05:13.554]  Number two, be physically prepared.
[03:05:13.574 --> 03:05:14.554]  Stock up food, water.
[03:05:14.895 --> 03:05:16.316]  Like I said, stock up.
[03:05:16.716 --> 03:05:18.217]  I usually use Goya.
[03:05:18.317 --> 03:05:22.880]  I go to Goya because, you know, because like their beans can last for like seven years, you know.
[03:05:23.380 --> 03:05:25.141]  Get food that can last for a long time.
[03:05:25.561 --> 03:05:27.583]  And I always advise people, don't throw away your food.
[03:05:28.323 --> 03:05:34.067]  If you look at your food and it's been expired for a year, you can still eat it as long as it doesn't smell or taste bad.
[03:05:34.427 --> 03:05:41.111]  I think your nose and your taste buds are a better indication of whether food is spoiled than the expiration date.
[03:05:41.591 --> 03:05:45.414]  We found out that expiration dates are just put there so that you can throw away the food and buy new ones.
[03:05:45.934 --> 03:05:48.535]  So don't throw away your food until they really smell bad or taste bad.
[03:05:48.715 --> 03:05:49.436]  And you can tell.
[03:05:49.816 --> 03:05:52.117]  If you open a can that is bad, it's going to smell bad.
[03:05:52.157 --> 03:05:55.639]  It's going to have, you know, sometimes it's going to have too much air in it or something.
[03:05:55.679 --> 03:05:55.959]  So yeah.
[03:05:56.359 --> 03:05:57.439]  So don't throw away your food.
[03:05:57.780 --> 03:06:01.401]  You know, watch your food before you throw it away and make sure you can reuse it.
[03:06:01.941 --> 03:06:03.162]  So stock up food.
[03:06:03.262 --> 03:06:08.044]  And then part of physical preparedness is like, you know, water filtration system.
[03:06:08.424 --> 03:06:11.506]  Get something that you can collect water from, from rainwater.
[03:06:12.702 --> 03:06:23.615]  When we have, think about this, if they have a disruptive event right now and there's no electricity, and we'll face that in Texas, because during the past hurricane that we had here, many people didn't have power for two weeks.
[03:06:24.762 --> 03:06:27.023]  Get a small solar generator.
[03:06:27.043 --> 03:06:28.264]  They have them right now for about $1,500.
[03:06:29.145 --> 03:06:38.010]  You can get a solar generator and that solar generator can run your refrigerator so that you can stock up, you can be able to save your food because a lot of people's food got spoiled because they didn't have a refrigerator.
[03:06:38.430 --> 03:06:48.136]  You have those solar generators, they have like portable solar panels that can just keep out in the sun, pull it into your house and plug it on the solar generator and you can be able to run your refrigerator
[03:06:48.616 --> 03:06:51.398]  Or, for people that have medical devices, they can be able to run that.
[03:06:51.878 --> 03:06:54.280]  So, find a way to get, you know, safe.
[03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:55.721]  Like I said, do garage sale.
[03:06:55.741 --> 03:06:56.562]  These things are important.
[03:06:56.962 --> 03:07:02.746]  And get a portable solar generator for your house, so that you can survive if there's no electricity.
[03:07:03.266 --> 03:07:06.048]  And of course, stock up batteries, charcoal grill.
[03:07:06.348 --> 03:07:09.471]  You know, with a charcoal grill, you can practically just put twigs in it and cook.
[03:07:09.931 --> 03:07:10.171]  You know?
[03:07:10.571 --> 03:07:14.274]  Get charcoal grill, batteries, you know, solar power banks, and stuff like that.
[03:07:14.674 --> 03:07:15.175]  We're good to go.
[03:07:33.152 --> 03:07:36.655]  Everybody has to have like a, I call it, they call it a boondocker bag.
[03:07:36.995 --> 03:07:39.157]  A bag that you can throw on you and take off.
[03:07:39.477 --> 03:07:40.598]  And it has the medicines you need.
[03:07:40.638 --> 03:07:42.199]  It has food supply for a little bit.
[03:07:42.599 --> 03:07:46.843]  It has, you know, you know, it has like over-the-counter things that you need.
[03:07:46.863 --> 03:07:47.883]  You have the first aid kit.
[03:07:48.264 --> 03:07:54.708]  Get those things so that when something happens, if you're floating, you can go up and you should have a bag that has everything that you need.
[03:07:55.049 --> 03:07:56.310]  So just be prepared.
[03:07:56.490 --> 03:07:58.011]  And that's what I tell everybody, be prepared.
[03:07:58.571 --> 03:08:01.814]  One of the things that we do is we help people to be medically prepared.
[03:08:02.791 --> 03:08:03.652]  Medically prepared.
[03:08:04.073 --> 03:08:11.442]  I tell people, like I say, all these viruses, they are RNA viruses, they are actually sensitive to Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine.
[03:08:12.063 --> 03:08:15.607]  There's a website called, I think it's IVM...
[03:08:17.950 --> 03:08:21.713]  C19ivm.com and C19hcq.com.
[03:08:22.053 --> 03:08:27.377]  If you go there, you'll see hundreds of studies that show that hydroxychloroquine helps with all of these viruses.
[03:08:27.857 --> 03:08:31.480]  So, make sure you have hydroxychloroquine ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:32.360]  Do it today.
[03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:33.201]  Go to your doctor.
[03:08:33.621 --> 03:08:34.822]  See whether they can give it to you.
[03:08:34.962 --> 03:08:37.164]  If they cannot give it to you, go on our website.
[03:08:37.204 --> 03:08:39.466]  In all 50 states, we have doctors that will prescribe it.
[03:08:40.106 --> 03:08:44.989]  But we will not call it to regular pharmacies because if you call it to mainstream pharmacies, they're not going to fill it.
[03:08:45.169 --> 03:08:46.590]  We've been doing that for four years now.
[03:08:46.991 --> 03:08:49.412]  But we call it to mainstream pharmacies and they refuse to fill it.
[03:08:49.973 --> 03:08:58.218]  So we put together a group of mom-and-pop pharmacies that are licensed all over the nation that can actually be able to ship these medications to your home.
[03:08:58.719 --> 03:09:04.783]  So if you wait till you get sick or you wait till something bad happens, we're not going to be able to ship it to you and it will get to you.
[03:09:04.883 --> 03:09:06.384]  What if the post office is disrupted?
[03:09:06.424 --> 03:09:07.725]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[03:09:08.025 --> 03:09:09.366]  And we cannot ship to you or
[03:09:10.266 --> 03:09:12.887]  Doing the crowd strike thing that happened.
[03:09:12.927 --> 03:09:27.014]  We could not even we could not even our website went down for a little bit Maybe you cannot even get on our website So I always tell people right now be prepared by having hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet today This is if there's anything you can get from this, please
[03:09:28.112 --> 03:09:30.013]  Because you can buy quercetin over the counter.
[03:09:30.273 --> 03:09:31.593]  You can get zinc over the counter.
[03:09:31.873 --> 03:09:35.175]  But to get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in America, you need a prescription.
[03:09:35.555 --> 03:09:44.158]  And right now, while we can still do it, while some of these crazy AGs are not fighting against it, get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet today.
[03:09:44.538 --> 03:09:47.619]  Do a telemedicine appointment on our website, drstellarmd.com.
[03:09:48.419 --> 03:09:50.340]  Make sure you do the telemedicine appointment.
[03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:52.061]  If you use promo code Alex, you'll get a discount.
[03:09:53.703 --> 03:09:54.923]  Get a telemedicine appointment.
[03:09:54.943 --> 03:09:57.464]  We're going to look at your weight, the medications that you're taking.
[03:09:57.484 --> 03:10:05.547]  We're going to look at your health, your health profile, and then they'll prescribe it to you according to your health profile, send it to the pharmacist, and then the pharmacist will ship it to you.
[03:10:05.988 --> 03:10:09.769]  Usually, we will give you with prevention that could last you about a year.
[03:10:10.209 --> 03:10:14.991]  So, some people are like, well, that is expensive, but we're giving you stuff that can last you for about a year.
[03:10:15.351 --> 03:10:18.072]  So, please, do that for you and your family and do it today.
[03:10:18.492 --> 03:10:19.833]  We have the COVID Complete Pack.
[03:10:19.913 --> 03:10:21.894]  It has ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine.
[03:10:21.974 --> 03:10:22.674]  It has Z-Pak.
[03:10:23.174 --> 03:10:24.275]  He has a nebulizer.
[03:10:24.816 --> 03:10:28.499]  This is a handheld nebulizer that you can use.
[03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:31.042]  If there's something happens, you can use it.
[03:10:31.582 --> 03:10:33.024]  You can charge it with your power bank.
[03:10:33.124 --> 03:10:36.247]  If there's no electricity and you need a breathing treatment, you can use it with your power bank.
[03:10:36.607 --> 03:10:38.329]  So this is part of the COVID complete pack.
[03:10:38.649 --> 03:10:45.596]  We also have a pulse oximeter where you can check your oxygen because you know, during COVID, most people could not check their oxygen and it's
[03:10:46.533 --> 03:10:47.873]  People started getting sick.
[03:10:47.933 --> 03:10:51.074]  Before even they got worse, their oxygen started dropping.
[03:10:51.134 --> 03:10:53.935]  So we have a pulse oximeter where you can check your oxygen.
[03:10:54.455 --> 03:10:58.036]  So get that for your family, for every member of your family.
[03:10:58.236 --> 03:10:59.337]  It's life-saving.
[03:10:59.717 --> 03:11:00.417]  It's gonna help you.
[03:11:00.797 --> 03:11:04.058]  And then we also have seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[03:11:04.098 --> 03:11:05.478]  You can get that on our websites too.
[03:11:06.079 --> 03:11:07.379]  Like I said, use promo code Alex.
[03:11:07.399 --> 03:11:09.159]  So that is my preparedness package.
[03:11:09.279 --> 03:11:14.341]  Preparedness, physical preparedness, medical preparedness, over-the-counter medicines,
[03:11:14.901 --> 03:11:18.782]  Food, stock up food, and then of course, we'll talk about financial preparedness.
[03:11:18.822 --> 03:11:20.543]  Make sure that you have gold and silver.
[03:11:21.123 --> 03:11:24.284]  Make sure that you have, you know, something that you can borrow with.
[03:11:25.044 --> 03:11:29.045]  And, of course, being that I'm a Texan, we always talk about our guns and ammo.
[03:11:29.406 --> 03:11:33.707]  Make sure you're well loaded, that if somebody's going to enter your house, you're going to go down fighting.
[03:11:33.727 --> 03:11:35.187]  You're not just going to throw your hand in the air.
[03:11:35.467 --> 03:11:36.828]  You'll be calling Jesus and shooting.
[03:11:36.848 --> 03:11:37.508]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:11:37.528 --> 03:11:40.449]  You're going to go down fighting if somebody breaks into your home and tries to harass you.
[03:11:40.749 --> 03:11:41.549]  Because think about it.
[03:11:42.030 --> 03:11:42.930]  If there's no food,
[03:11:44.093 --> 03:11:47.795]  Within three days, people are going to start storming the houses of people trying to get food.
[03:11:48.375 --> 03:11:51.057]  People get crazy when things go bad.
[03:11:51.177 --> 03:11:54.239]  So make sure that you're in a position to protect you and your family.
[03:11:54.559 --> 03:11:57.181]  So that is what I want to tell the American people right now.
[03:11:58.163 --> 03:12:05.846]  As you do this, remember, I'm not saying this to scare you, I'm not trying to get you to be like, oh my God, Dr. Stella is saying this, I'm terrified.
[03:12:05.926 --> 03:12:07.067]  No, no, no, you don't need to be terrified.
[03:12:07.807 --> 03:12:10.648]  The only reason is that if you are prepared, then you will not be scared.
[03:12:11.068 --> 03:12:17.331]  If you have food, if you have medication, if you have your over-the-counter medicines, if you have charcoal grill and everything, you will not be scared.
[03:12:17.851 --> 03:12:24.553]  The last time we had a hurricane pass through, we went through it like a breeze because we had everything that we needed.
[03:12:24.873 --> 03:12:27.433]  Our fridges were working just good and everything was fine.
[03:12:28.093 --> 03:12:30.254]  Make sure that you are prepared.
[03:12:30.854 --> 03:12:31.774]  That is what I would say.
[03:12:32.474 --> 03:12:37.495]  And the other thing of health preparedness, of course, is that make sure that you take care of your health very well.
[03:12:37.895 --> 03:12:39.636]  Exercise, fresh fruits,
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:44.342]  Eat good food, you know, and, oh, I forgot one more thing.
[03:12:44.562 --> 03:12:45.703]  Learn to grow your own food.
[03:12:46.383 --> 03:12:57.991]  If you live in an urban area, you can practically grow spices, like we're growing lemongrass, we're growing mint on our ranch, we're growing food, you know, corn, beans, peanuts, we're just growing food.
[03:12:58.391 --> 03:13:00.692]  If you don't have a ranch, like we do,
[03:13:02.473 --> 03:13:04.535]  Just get a family member or friends.
[03:13:04.876 --> 03:13:10.701]  If somebody has a five acre lot somewhere, you can actually rent part of it, and you guys can learn to grow stuff like a community.
[03:13:10.901 --> 03:13:11.762]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:13:11.782 --> 03:13:16.546]  Rent maybe half an acre from them, and without half an acre you rent, you can learn how to grow your own food.
[03:13:17.007 --> 03:13:18.088]  How do you learn how to grow food?
[03:13:18.108 --> 03:13:19.589]  Just go online and Google it.
[03:13:19.989 --> 03:13:24.333]  You know, grow watermelon and cucumbers and beans and rice and stuff.
[03:13:24.694 --> 03:13:25.555]  Potatoes, do you know?
[03:13:26.704 --> 03:13:32.029]  Potatoes can practically grow in a bag and potatoes take like about three months to ripen.
[03:13:32.369 --> 03:13:34.411]  So potatoes is like one of the easiest things to grow.
[03:13:34.831 --> 03:13:43.639]  Buy some potatoes from... I actually try to go to places where they still have non-GMO stuff and then I buy them so that I can grow my own food, you know.
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:44.941]  So learn to grow your own food.
[03:13:45.501 --> 03:13:49.685]  Just in case things get really, really crazy and you have to feed yourself or fend for yourself.
[03:13:49.705 --> 03:13:50.766]  So learn these things.
[03:13:51.167 --> 03:13:56.932]  You know, when you get together with people, start learning to build communities of people that can protect each other.
[03:13:57.793 --> 03:14:03.159]  We grew up, we as human beings, in the past we all had communities and communities took care of each other.
[03:14:03.499 --> 03:14:04.100]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:08.504]  You know, but right now, most people don't understand community anymore.
[03:14:08.544 --> 03:14:11.206]  Everybody's just on their cell phone and nobody wants to talk to anybody.
[03:14:11.507 --> 03:14:19.214]  It's time to go back to hanging around with communities and just learning to sit with other people, talk with other people.
[03:14:19.574 --> 03:14:20.015]  We're good to go.
[03:14:36.243 --> 03:14:39.864]  These globalists, they have a lot of crazy stuff planned for us.
[03:14:40.324 --> 03:14:41.365]  I just came back from Africa.
[03:14:41.385 --> 03:14:42.885]  Like I said, I was in Nigeria.
[03:14:43.285 --> 03:14:44.586]  I was in Uganda and Kenya.
[03:14:44.766 --> 03:14:45.746]  It is crazy.
[03:14:46.186 --> 03:14:48.727]  There's so much digitalization right now.
[03:14:49.167 --> 03:14:51.288]  In some places, they didn't even look at my ticket.
[03:14:51.328 --> 03:14:52.408]  They just looked at my face.
[03:14:52.729 --> 03:14:54.689]  And they were able to put me on the plane with just my face.
[03:14:55.009 --> 03:14:55.529]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:59.731]  In Kenya right now, they are trying to keep babies from when they are born.
[03:15:00.831 --> 03:15:03.032]  Nigeria is in a really, really bad state.
[03:15:03.072 --> 03:15:05.734]  I'm probably going to talk about it a little more before I go into scripture.
[03:15:06.114 --> 03:15:08.016]  Nigeria is in a horrible state right now.
[03:15:08.336 --> 03:15:12.859]  They're about to, when I was there, they were rioting because there's famine in the land.
[03:15:13.139 --> 03:15:14.359]  People don't have food to eat.
[03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:21.324]  People don't have, you know, a bag of rice has gone from like 15,000 naira to about 100,000 naira.
[03:15:21.384 --> 03:15:27.828]  It's crazy that, you know, right now, you know, when this current president took over Atenebo, he crashed everything.
[03:15:28.348 --> 03:15:33.232]  He took subsidies of gasoline, he took subsidies of diesel, he took subsidies of electricity.
[03:15:33.592 --> 03:15:37.875]  And think about it, Nigeria is an oil producing nation.
[03:15:38.415 --> 03:15:41.337]  He took all these subsidies, crashed everything, crashed the whole economy.
[03:15:41.938 --> 03:15:47.162]  And Nigerians don't farm because their economy is based on oil and industrialization.
[03:15:47.922 --> 03:15:56.047]  And when people started thinking about going back to the farm, they have Boko Haram and felony herdsmen killing people in the farm, so Nigerians cannot even go back to the farm.
[03:15:56.267 --> 03:15:56.828]  They are starving.
[03:15:57.128 --> 03:16:00.170]  People are practically dying from starvation in Nigeria right now.
[03:16:00.490 --> 03:16:06.914]  They use Nigeria as their flagship country for digitalization, and they've taken over Nigeria.
[03:16:07.394 --> 03:16:12.057]  In Nigeria right now, you cannot take out $30 from your bank account.
[03:16:12.277 --> 03:16:15.179]  You have old mothers that can barely
[03:16:15.839 --> 03:16:19.663]  Can barely understand English, transmitting money through their cell phone.
[03:16:19.683 --> 03:16:20.884]  So this is where we are right now.
[03:16:21.505 --> 03:16:24.008]  And in Uganda, everywhere is digitalized.
[03:16:24.088 --> 03:16:26.170]  So we know that this is coming.
[03:16:26.270 --> 03:16:30.375]  And right now, like I said, be prepared America, because this is the times that we're in.
[03:16:30.895 --> 03:16:35.640]  And I will be back again in the next segment to talk to you a little more about what the Bible says about this.
[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:37.923]  Like I said, Bible science and current events.
[03:16:38.359 --> 03:16:40.421]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[03:16:40.641 --> 03:16:45.184]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[03:16:45.324 --> 03:16:48.227]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[03:16:48.567 --> 03:16:49.768]  That's our only incentive.
[03:16:49.908 --> 03:16:52.410]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[03:16:52.950 --> 03:17:00.916]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[03:17:00.936 --> 03:17:04.799]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:06.680]  We're good to go.
[03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:28.610]  Hello!
[03:17:28.650 --> 03:17:29.432]  Hi America, I'm back!
[03:17:41.428 --> 03:17:48.493]  Now, I actually want to, we're going to be going into a lot of things that are happening, why all this is happening, and what the Scriptures are talking about.
[03:17:48.613 --> 03:17:51.735]  Like I said, my statement is Bible Science and Current Events.
[03:17:53.977 --> 03:18:00.522]  I just came back from Africa, as I said in the last segment, and there's a lot of digitalization going on all over the world.
[03:18:00.762 --> 03:18:10.189]  I would tell everybody, just pick up your phone, Google Digital ID, and just put any nation, whether it's Kenya, Mexico, Colombia, America, Canada.
[03:18:10.888 --> 03:18:12.050]  All nations right now.
[03:18:12.130 --> 03:18:15.914]  In fact, the global is one by 2025 for all nations to have a digital ID.
[03:18:16.555 --> 03:18:21.100]  So they pick Nigeria as a flagship country for their digitalization.
[03:18:21.946 --> 03:18:24.088]  And what does this have to do with Scripture?
[03:18:24.188 --> 03:18:36.097]  If you read in the Bible, in the book of Revelation, chapter 13, verse 16 to 18, it talks about a time will come when you're not going to be able to buy or sell until you have a mark under your skin or on your forehead.
[03:18:36.898 --> 03:18:41.822]  And when they talk about this mark, everybody has talked about the mark of the beast, the 666 mark of the beast.
[03:18:41.842 --> 03:18:42.702]  We've heard it for ages.
[03:18:42.722 --> 03:18:44.003]  We've preached about it for a long time.
[03:18:44.684 --> 03:18:48.147]  But right now, everything is together to bring that to pass.
[03:18:48.167 --> 03:18:49.928]  So the beast system is ready right now.
[03:18:49.948 --> 03:18:50.969]  The mark of the beast is ready.
[03:18:52.310 --> 03:19:03.019]  And it's actually going to be a currency, because the Bible says you're not going to be able to buy or sell without having this mark.
[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:04.100]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:19:07.503 --> 03:19:13.488]  It's not an arbitrary something or, you know, something that is going to be something in the spirit that people will not see in the physical.
[03:19:13.929 --> 03:19:17.031]  You're not going to be able to buy or sell without it.
[03:19:17.091 --> 03:19:18.493]  So it's actually a currency.
[03:19:18.953 --> 03:19:24.318]  And when we heard about this and preached about this for years, we didn't even realize it until now.
[03:19:24.378 --> 03:19:30.023]  We're seeing the whole system come together about this beast system, you know, that everybody's going to
[03:19:30.863 --> 03:19:34.866]  Nobody's going to be able to buy or sell until you have this digital ID, you know?
[03:19:35.347 --> 03:19:38.329]  And if you can Google it, there's something called the quantum.
[03:19:39.488 --> 03:19:40.649]  Digital ID is the quant.
[03:19:40.689 --> 03:19:42.010]  This was put together in 2005.
[03:19:42.851 --> 03:19:44.993]  In 2015, sorry.
[03:19:45.474 --> 03:19:47.415]  So they had their digital ID ready.
[03:19:47.856 --> 03:20:01.128]  You can actually, if you Google Bill Gates and Rice University quantum dot tattoo, they had it there so that it can easily track your immunization, they can track your immunization, they can track your money and everything.
[03:20:03.283 --> 03:20:07.207]  So a lot of people is like, this is just about control and digitalization.
[03:20:07.247 --> 03:20:08.629]  It's about they want to control us.
[03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:10.671]  They want to take our money, depopulation.
[03:20:11.252 --> 03:20:14.815]  But I think it's a deeper thing than just depopulation and control.
[03:20:14.895 --> 03:20:16.617]  I think it's a deeply spiritual thing.
[03:20:17.118 --> 03:20:18.820]  Why do I think it's a deeply spiritual thing?
[03:20:18.900 --> 03:20:22.744]  Because I do believe that the devil wants you and I to be corrupted.
[03:20:23.184 --> 03:20:27.987]  If you and I are corrupted, then we would pledge our allegiance to the devil.
[03:20:28.207 --> 03:20:31.329]  And then once we pledge our allegiance to the devil, the devil can take over our world.
[03:20:31.729 --> 03:20:33.330]  And that's what everybody has to understand.
[03:20:33.810 --> 03:20:38.432]  So they picked Nigeria as one of the flagship countries to put this digitalization together.
[03:20:38.933 --> 03:20:40.994]  Nigeria is one of the biggest countries in Africa.
[03:20:41.454 --> 03:20:42.875]  Nigeria is so industrialized.
[03:20:42.895 --> 03:20:44.056]  It's just kind of like America.
[03:20:44.256 --> 03:20:45.577]  People there don't go to the farm.
[03:20:46.698 --> 03:20:53.683]  Nigeria had this oil boom that came through and then, you know, they have industries and, you know, so Nigeria is a pretty great country, you know?
[03:20:54.244 --> 03:21:03.291]  I know a lot of people don't know a lot of what's going on in Nigeria and a lot of people just hear some of the crazy stuff that a few Nigerians do, but Nigeria is a pretty great country.
[03:21:03.691 --> 03:21:05.613]  And, you know, it's like the giant of Africa.
[03:21:05.633 --> 03:21:08.395]  Nigeria has about 200 million people.
[03:21:09.531 --> 03:21:18.759]  So many, 200 and something million people, so many people in Nigeria actually survive in business because Sinks is such, it has such a large population in a small area.
[03:21:18.799 --> 03:21:21.822]  The landmass of Nigeria is not even up to the landmass of Texas.
[03:21:22.182 --> 03:21:26.266]  So you have about 200 and something million people living in this small landmass.
[03:21:26.946 --> 03:21:28.547]  Everybody buys and sells.
[03:21:28.587 --> 03:21:31.108]  Nigeria is a country where you can do all kinds of businesses.
[03:21:31.308 --> 03:21:39.351]  Anything that you sell in Nigeria, you're going to find people to buy it because the population is so thick and so much in a small area.
[03:21:40.951 --> 03:21:44.293]  Because of that, I think Nigerians have learned to do a lot of business.
[03:21:44.733 --> 03:21:46.954]  A lot of Nigerians actually got away from farming.
[03:21:48.394 --> 03:21:59.002]  If you look at, I was in Uganda, one of the reasons why it's gonna be harder to take down a country like Uganda or to take down a country like Cameroon, which is, I come from Cameroon originally, is that we have food.
[03:21:59.502 --> 03:22:04.445]  Cameroon has been in a war right now for almost 10 years, but the people still survive because we have food.
[03:22:04.746 --> 03:22:07.467]  The whole economy of Cameroon is based on agriculture.
[03:22:07.768 --> 03:22:12.271]  Yes, we have oil, but we never knew what happened to the oil.
[03:22:13.031 --> 03:22:15.493]  The oligarchs just take it and sell it to their friends in the West.
[03:22:16.914 --> 03:22:18.114]  We never saw anything about it.
[03:22:18.174 --> 03:22:20.955]  So our economy is still really based on agriculture.
[03:22:20.995 --> 03:22:22.216]  Everybody in Cameroon farms.
[03:22:22.816 --> 03:22:24.516]  You know, even at all levels.
[03:22:24.836 --> 03:22:27.677]  Ministers, teachers, doctors, everybody in Cameroon has a farm.
[03:22:27.977 --> 03:22:29.578]  So we've always learned how to farm.
[03:22:30.178 --> 03:22:32.799]  And because of that, the Cameroon economy is based on agriculture.
[03:22:32.819 --> 03:22:33.419]  So there's food.
[03:22:33.439 --> 03:22:34.899]  There's plenty of food everywhere.
[03:22:35.499 --> 03:22:37.180]  But Nigeria is a different situation.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:37.840]  They don't have food.
[03:22:38.857 --> 03:22:42.639]  What happened three years ago, they started with telling everybody in Nigeria to bring their phones.
[03:22:42.859 --> 03:22:46.560]  That if you do not turn your phone in, if you do not register your phone, they turn it off.
[03:22:47.001 --> 03:22:49.362]  So most Nigerians had to go register their phone.
[03:22:49.402 --> 03:22:51.142]  That is how their digital ID started.
[03:22:51.422 --> 03:22:54.864]  Because Nigeria was a country where you couldn't track anybody because everybody was everywhere.
[03:22:55.144 --> 03:22:55.884]  Nobody had anything.
[03:22:56.144 --> 03:22:58.425]  Nobody knew the number of people that were even in Nigeria.
[03:22:58.786 --> 03:23:03.948]  They decided that if you cannot have a phone in Nigeria until you register it with the system,
[03:23:04.648 --> 03:23:08.899]  So you have to register with the system, and if you do not register with the system, they turn your phone off.
[03:23:09.420 --> 03:23:11.806]  So three years ago, all Nigerians had to register their phones.
[03:23:12.927 --> 03:23:19.473]  Then, two years ago, around the end of the year, they decided that they wanted to change the Nigerian Naira.
[03:23:19.493 --> 03:23:20.554]  They wanted to change the currency.
[03:23:20.594 --> 03:23:21.335]  This is what they said.
[03:23:21.575 --> 03:23:23.016]  They're like, well, election is coming.
[03:23:23.617 --> 03:23:31.444]  They want to make sure that the currency is changed, because if they don't change the currency, you know, if they don't change the color of the currency, there's a lot of people keeping money.
[03:23:31.484 --> 03:23:33.065]  There's going to be fraud during the elections.
[03:23:33.606 --> 03:23:37.029]  So they mopped out trillions of Naira out of the Nigerian system.
[03:23:37.609 --> 03:23:38.370]  And then what happened?
[03:23:38.490 --> 03:23:41.331]  When it was time to give the money back, they refused to give them the money back.
[03:23:41.632 --> 03:23:43.573]  People had to start using transmitting money.
[03:23:43.633 --> 03:23:47.095]  So Nigeria has actually adopted the e-Naira, whether they like it or not.
[03:23:47.515 --> 03:23:52.778]  Right now in Nigeria, you cannot even withdraw $30,000 out of the bank.
[03:23:53.239 --> 03:23:54.980]  So most people have learned to transmit money.
[03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:55.820]  Thank you.
[03:24:12.436 --> 03:24:14.116]  OB was the favorite of the country.
[03:24:14.176 --> 03:24:14.997]  I'm sure he won.
[03:24:15.277 --> 03:24:18.237]  But of course, they installed Tinubu because Tinubu is a globalist.
[03:24:18.257 --> 03:24:21.638]  The minute they installed him, Bill Gates was there doing that thing.
[03:24:21.938 --> 03:24:22.878]  The globalists were there.
[03:24:22.918 --> 03:24:29.580]  In fact, during the election, this girl in Atlanta, Stacey Adams, was actually in Nigeria during the election.
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:34.481]  So when I saw that, I told Nigerians, I said, listen, Tinubu is going to win because they're going to install him because he's a globalist.
[03:24:34.921 --> 03:24:35.161]  Thank you.
[03:24:50.291 --> 03:24:51.532]  Uh, about 800 Naira.
[03:24:51.572 --> 03:24:56.315]  So just think about gasoline going from maybe $1.50 to $8.
[03:24:56.956 --> 03:24:58.056]  That's the kind of thing that happened.
[03:24:58.577 --> 03:25:00.598]  Diesel also has gone that crazy.
[03:25:00.918 --> 03:25:06.042]  If I was in Nigeria, people would line up for hours just to get gas, just to buy gas.
[03:25:06.142 --> 03:25:07.042]  That is crazy.
[03:25:07.343 --> 03:25:10.285]  People are lining up for like hours, like just the road is blocked.
[03:25:10.345 --> 03:25:10.585]  Why?
[03:25:10.965 --> 03:25:13.307]  Because the gas station, the filling stations don't even have gas.
[03:25:13.527 --> 03:25:14.627]  So people are lining up to get gas.
[03:25:14.868 --> 03:25:16.429]  So this is happening in Nigeria right now.
[03:25:17.358 --> 03:25:18.520]  Electricity has gone up.
[03:25:18.921 --> 03:25:22.386]  So with that, food, transportation, everything has gone up.
[03:25:22.746 --> 03:25:24.349]  A bag of rice, that was about maybe $15.
[03:25:24.489 --> 03:25:26.813]  It's right now about maybe $100.
[03:25:27.173 --> 03:25:29.957]  So let me, from $15 Naira to $100 Naira.
[03:25:30.338 --> 03:25:31.139]  Food is scarce.
[03:25:31.159 --> 03:25:31.960]  People don't have food.
[03:25:32.521 --> 03:25:39.064]  Nigerians that have been trying to go back to the farm, they have what they call Boko Haram and the Fulani herdsmen killing them in the farms.
[03:25:39.304 --> 03:25:45.126]  So Nigerians cannot even return back to agriculture because they have the Fulani herdsmen that are killing people in the farms and everything.
[03:25:45.166 --> 03:25:47.207]  Boko Haram, you've heard about all these terrorists.
[03:25:47.227 --> 03:25:48.548]  So Nigeria is in a really bad state.
[03:25:49.068 --> 03:25:52.950]  So when I left, when I just left last week, they were rioting because there's no food.
[03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:57.331]  And I keep telling Nigerians that the issue with rioting is that they're going to want them to riot.
[03:25:57.611 --> 03:26:03.292]  They are beginning to talk already about universal basic income, where they're going to give people food, essential commodities, rice, and everything.
[03:26:03.652 --> 03:26:07.653]  And of course, they will start it by putting it in a cart, and the next thing is going to go under your skin.
[03:26:08.293 --> 03:26:10.853]  They're just using Nigeria as a flagship country.
[03:26:10.913 --> 03:26:12.534]  This is not just going to happen in Nigeria.
[03:26:12.934 --> 03:26:14.054]  In America, it's going to happen.
[03:26:14.074 --> 03:26:15.074]  It's going to happen everywhere.
[03:26:15.114 --> 03:26:15.814]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:26:15.954 --> 03:26:18.735]  So they just did it in Nigeria, and they found out that they succeeded.
[03:26:19.315 --> 03:26:21.016]  They succeeded to get Nigerians down.
[03:26:21.036 --> 03:26:23.978]  So Nigerians are trying to riot right now, go out on the street and march.
[03:26:24.378 --> 03:26:25.318]  But it's not going to happen.
[03:26:25.358 --> 03:26:25.939]  It's not going to help.
[03:26:26.259 --> 03:26:37.245]  Because when they start rioting, that is when they will really lock them down, bring security measures, introduce universal basic income, and insist that because of this security everybody has to take this mark.
[03:26:37.924 --> 03:26:46.431]  So I need people to hear this so that if it starts happening in our country or start happening anywhere else, you can be aware of the fact that they have these things in place.
[03:26:46.811 --> 03:26:48.072]  So you don't comply.
[03:26:48.452 --> 03:26:52.035]  I thank God for the patriots in America because Nigerians are not really patriotic.
[03:26:52.095 --> 03:26:54.437]  Nigerians are like man for himself, God for we all.
[03:26:56.278 --> 03:27:02.827]  Americans were patriotic, so I thank God for the American patriots that are willing to stand and fight for this nation and willing to say no.
[03:27:03.247 --> 03:27:08.915]  So I'm telling this to just inform you so that way you don't wait till something crazy happens and then you're like, what do I do?
[03:27:09.295 --> 03:27:11.699]  You be prepared and also do not comply.
[03:27:12.938 --> 03:27:16.180]  Do not comply to whatever it is that they're trying to bring down.
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:18.781]  It is because we refuse to comply.
[03:27:19.062 --> 03:27:21.003]  That is why the world is still the way it is today.
[03:27:21.303 --> 03:27:28.387]  I remember 2020, July of 2020, where I stood in front of the Supreme Court and screamed that COVID is treatable.
[03:27:28.667 --> 03:27:29.368]  Do not be scared.
[03:27:29.408 --> 03:27:30.108]  Come out of your homes.
[03:27:30.128 --> 03:27:31.049]  You don't need to be locked down.
[03:27:32.089 --> 03:27:34.010]  It was because I was not afraid to die.
[03:27:34.211 --> 03:27:37.153]  And when you are not afraid to die, God always has your back.
[03:27:37.553 --> 03:27:43.237]  The Bible says that we overcome by the blood of the lamb at the word of our testimony because we love not our lives unto death.
[03:27:43.717 --> 03:27:45.719]  So this is the situation that we're dealing with.
[03:27:46.039 --> 03:27:51.122]  The situation, this is a spiritual battle that they are using physical means to fight it.
[03:27:51.503 --> 03:27:58.287]  They're going to use, if you read in the Bible in Matthew 24, they're going to be famine, pestilences, they're going to be wars and rumors of wars.
[03:27:58.327 --> 03:27:59.408]  They're going to be
[03:27:59.668 --> 03:28:03.069]  Bad weather events, earthquakes in diverse places.
[03:28:03.489 --> 03:28:13.832]  The Bible has written these things already and it's important that you know what the Bible says so that you can stand in these last days and not just be like, I don't know what's going on and I'm scared.
[03:28:14.152 --> 03:28:21.374]  If you know the truth and you read towards the end of the Bible, you read Revelation all the way to the end, you'll see that at the end of the day, Jesus wins this battle.
[03:28:21.895 --> 03:28:26.436]  But between now and when Jesus wins the battle and comes back to save all of us and humanity,
[03:28:27.156 --> 03:28:29.458]  There's going to be a lot of perilous times coming.
[03:28:30.679 --> 03:28:31.780]  Crazy times are coming.
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:36.323]  And you need to know that so that you are not overtaken by the crazy times.
[03:28:36.763 --> 03:28:38.265]  So that's what I'm talking about.
[03:28:38.405 --> 03:28:42.368]  And if you read in the book, there's a scripture that I have in the book of Daniel.
[03:28:43.533 --> 03:28:55.790]  The Bible says in the book of Daniel that, Daniel chapter 11 verse 32, it says, And such as do weakly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries.
[03:28:56.671 --> 03:29:00.056]  But the people that know their God shall be strong and do exploit.
[03:29:00.997 --> 03:29:06.299]  What does this mean?
[03:29:06.739 --> 03:29:22.903]  That means if you live your life in wickedness, if you live your life against the Word of God, if you live your life sinning in iniquity, you're opening up for the devil to corrupt you, to corrupt your mind, to corrupt your soul, to corrupt your flesh.
[03:29:23.203 --> 03:29:25.904]  What I mean by sin, I'm talking about sin like
[03:29:26.744 --> 03:29:33.528]  Sex, outside marriage, like smoking, drinking, lying, fornication, just all the things that we do that are against the Word of God.
[03:29:33.968 --> 03:29:39.511]  If we allow those things into our lives, then we'll allow the devil to corrupt us, because that's what happens.
[03:29:39.831 --> 03:29:42.193]  The devil only attacks you when you open the door.
[03:29:42.553 --> 03:29:43.133]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:29:43.553 --> 03:29:47.836]  But those that know God, know their God, they will be strong and they will do exploits.
[03:29:48.236 --> 03:29:51.298]  That means if you know who you are in Christ,
[03:29:51.878 --> 03:29:54.359]  It's not just by claiming that, oh, I'm saved.
[03:29:54.699 --> 03:29:58.160]  It's actually really knowing God's will for your life.
[03:29:58.640 --> 03:30:03.981]  If you don't read the Bible and know the Bible for yourself, you will be harassed by the devil.
[03:30:04.261 --> 03:30:05.322]  You will be corrupted.
[03:30:05.602 --> 03:30:06.882]  You will go through fear.
[03:30:06.942 --> 03:30:09.443]  You will have all kinds of evil stuff happening to you.
[03:30:10.083 --> 03:30:20.852]  You know, we as prayer warriors, people are always calling me, Dr. Stella, the devil is doing this, or there's a witch doing this to me, or there's somebody doing that to me, or this is happening to me, or they shot some weapon in my body.
[03:30:21.332 --> 03:30:23.574]  And I keep saying the issue is that you don't know your God.
[03:30:23.674 --> 03:30:30.981]  If you know God, and you're connected to God, and you're connected to the Holy Spirit, and you're connected to the Word of God, God will protect you.
[03:30:31.943 --> 03:30:36.486]  The Bible says the angels of God encamp around about those that fear God.
[03:30:36.847 --> 03:30:39.869]  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[03:30:40.369 --> 03:30:47.174]  Don't just live your life in your own way because we are in the end times when the devil wants to corrupt all of us.
[03:30:47.614 --> 03:30:52.077]  All these digitalization things that they are doing is not just about population control.
[03:30:52.158 --> 03:30:53.839]  It's not just about controlling what you do.
[03:30:54.219 --> 03:30:58.142]  It's about getting under your skin and corrupting your humanity.
[03:30:58.662 --> 03:31:03.531]  All these gene modification vaccines that are giving people is about corrupting your humanity.
[03:31:03.892 --> 03:31:06.957]  And when they corrupt your humanity, you're no longer fully human.
[03:31:07.278 --> 03:31:09.362]  And when that happens, you are in trouble.
[03:31:10.259 --> 03:31:19.444]  The Lord gave me this scripture for those that took the vaccine because there's always the beautiful thing about knowing God is that God is a good God.
[03:31:19.464 --> 03:31:26.469]  He's a benevolent God and he always has a way out for those that repent, for those that look at what they do and said, man, I was wrong.
[03:31:26.889 --> 03:31:28.510]  This is before you take the mark of the beast.
[03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:31.411]  When you say here, put the mark on my hand, you're gone for.
[03:31:31.992 --> 03:31:35.434]  I don't think the vaccine was the mark because first of all, it's not on your wrist.
[03:31:36.601 --> 03:31:39.623]  Second of all, I don't think people are going to be deceived.
[03:31:39.863 --> 03:31:42.284]  The Bible says he causes people to take the mark.
[03:31:42.725 --> 03:31:45.146]  So the beast system is being put together.
[03:31:45.606 --> 03:31:54.712]  But you see, if you know God and you know what you're doing and you understand the Word of God and what is happening, you're not going to take this thing into your system.
[03:31:55.112 --> 03:31:59.414]  So for those that took the vaccine, my first thing I will tell you is repent.
[03:32:00.095 --> 03:32:03.477]  And when I have told people to repent, they're like, why should I repent if I was deceived?
[03:32:03.617 --> 03:32:05.118]  Repent because you were deceived.
[03:32:05.698 --> 03:32:11.601]  If you knew the Word of God, if you heard the Holy Spirit, if you knew God for yourself, and you had discernment, you would not have been deceived.
[03:32:12.141 --> 03:32:13.862]  People are like, well, I needed to feed my family.
[03:32:14.302 --> 03:32:16.983]  It's because you did not believe that God could feed you.
[03:32:17.263 --> 03:32:18.464]  Oh, I was scared that I could die.
[03:32:19.004 --> 03:32:19.844]  The spirit of fear.
[03:32:19.884 --> 03:32:26.427]  You did not believe that God could take care of you, so you were afraid to die, or you were afraid to lose your job, or you just wanted convenience.
[03:32:26.887 --> 03:32:31.369]  Whatever reason that you took the vaccine, or you just didn't know you were deceived.
[03:32:31.629 --> 03:32:32.510]  Why were you deceived?
[03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:35.092]  You were deceived because you didn't hear the Holy Spirit.
[03:32:35.512 --> 03:32:41.816]  Many people, I'm sure a lot of you listening to me, actually had dreams, visions, revelations that said, no, no, no, don't take the vaccine.
[03:32:41.896 --> 03:32:45.719]  Many people had visions from the Lord to not take the vaccine, had dreams to not take the vaccine.
[03:32:46.159 --> 03:32:54.184]  And we also came out and God used voices like me and many other voices to shout to you not to take it, but you took it anyway.
[03:32:54.805 --> 03:32:56.986]  So that is why you need to repent.
[03:32:57.466 --> 03:33:01.689]  The Bible says in Titus chapter 3 verse 5, and you can put that up, Titus 3 verse 5,
[03:33:03.427 --> 03:33:08.550]  That salvation is by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[03:33:08.951 --> 03:33:11.652]  In other words, how do you get saved?
[03:33:12.093 --> 03:33:16.776]  I believe what happened in the Garden of Eden was a spiritual genetic corruption.
[03:33:17.376 --> 03:33:23.120]  Because of that, all of us got corrupted and we all had the mindset of the corruption that came from Adam.
[03:33:23.780 --> 03:33:29.082]  So when you give your life to Christ, you repent from your sins and you ask the Lord Jesus into your heart.
[03:33:29.682 --> 03:33:39.685]  If the devil has deceived you to corrupt you again the same way he deceived Eve in the Garden of Eden, you can pray and ask God to have mercy on you and repent.
[03:33:40.365 --> 03:33:44.569]  And then if you go on our website, the Bible, there's a place that you can use.
[03:33:44.589 --> 03:33:55.858]  You see, not by words of righteousness, which we have done, but according to His mercy has saved us by the washing of regeneration.
[03:33:56.498 --> 03:34:01.142]  Or regeneration and by the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[03:34:01.543 --> 03:34:04.665]  So God can regenerate you.
[03:34:05.086 --> 03:34:08.608]  God can change your genes back to his genes.
[03:34:08.648 --> 03:34:10.110]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:34:10.750 --> 03:34:11.571]  Regeneration.
[03:34:11.851 --> 03:34:14.333]  When you give your life to Christ, there is regeneration.
[03:34:14.734 --> 03:34:18.457]  And if you took this vaccine, pray for God to regenerate you.
[03:34:18.977 --> 03:34:23.406]  If you go to DrStellaMD.com, there's a post that says, did you take the vaccine?
[03:34:23.686 --> 03:34:24.688]  Do you regret it?
[03:34:25.009 --> 03:34:31.321]  They will enter an email and we will send you prayers that you can do so that God can change your spiritual DNA back.
[03:34:32.486 --> 03:34:38.168]  There is a spiritual corruption that comes from taking the vaccine and also a physical corruption.
[03:34:38.248 --> 03:34:42.470]  We deal with the physical corruption by what we call the Vax Detox.
[03:34:42.510 --> 03:34:44.531]  We have, you know, a Vax Detox.
[03:34:44.571 --> 03:34:45.512]  We have Covilight.
[03:34:45.552 --> 03:34:48.113]  We have Covicleanse and Covivisa.
[03:34:48.153 --> 03:34:51.934]  We give you to help you to detox the physical effect of the vaccine.
[03:34:52.374 --> 03:34:53.475]  It is just a help.
[03:34:53.875 --> 03:34:59.917]  But the main thing that you need to do is to get the spiritual consequences and then you will have a relief in the physical.
[03:35:00.197 --> 03:35:01.358]  We have prayed for people.
[03:35:01.598 --> 03:35:04.119]  We prayed for a lady that was paralyzed and she repented.
[03:35:04.159 --> 03:35:04.859]  She was crying.
[03:35:05.199 --> 03:35:06.379]  I just laid hands on her.
[03:35:06.719 --> 03:35:12.722]  I said, let the redemptive power in the blood of Jesus flow through you and regenerate you in the name of Jesus.
[03:35:12.802 --> 03:35:15.282]  I said, blood of Jesus go deep into our DNA.
[03:35:15.743 --> 03:35:16.523]  Make her new.
[03:35:17.083 --> 03:35:19.965]  This woman, I'm telling you, the paralysis got released.
[03:35:20.165 --> 03:35:22.427]  This was at a conference out in the open.
[03:35:22.647 --> 03:35:23.547]  People saw it.
[03:35:23.748 --> 03:35:25.028]  The paralysis got released.
[03:35:25.449 --> 03:35:28.971]  And you know, we've had people prayed with heart disease, that the heart disease got released.
[03:35:29.191 --> 03:35:31.793]  We've had all kinds of diseases that come from this vaccine.
[03:35:32.073 --> 03:35:40.098]  And when people repent and truly cry out to God, God does not only regenerate them spiritually, but he also heals the physical effects.
[03:35:40.739 --> 03:35:46.583]  So believe that God can heal you and start trusting in God's word to heal.
[03:35:47.824 --> 03:36:01.031]  And you know, so this is what I'm telling people, don't be scared and say, oh my God, I am gone, I'm doomed for, until you have taken the mark that will be injected in your skin and the forehead, that you still have an ability to repent.
[03:36:01.432 --> 03:36:06.655]  So please repent, ask the Lord to help you and clean yourself from this system and have faith, you know.
[03:36:07.435 --> 03:36:12.162]  A lot of people, the reason why all this crazy stuff is happening today is because they don't have faith.
[03:36:12.202 --> 03:36:20.175]  You know, in the Bible, they talk about in the last days there will be perilous times, you know, the love of many will wax cold.
[03:36:20.876 --> 03:36:22.178]  We are in the last days.
[03:36:22.518 --> 03:36:29.202]  The veil of the last days is people don't know God anymore, people don't want to pray, they don't want to read the Bible, people's hearts are cold.
[03:36:29.662 --> 03:36:35.205]  If you read the book of Acts, you know our churches right now do not even look like what used to happen in the book of Acts.
[03:36:35.565 --> 03:36:40.248]  It's because we're under the veil of the last days and every one of us have to understand that.
[03:36:41.365 --> 03:36:44.686]  And realize that, so that you do not get deceived.
[03:36:44.746 --> 03:36:46.147]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:36:46.167 --> 03:36:58.110]  1 Timothy chapter 4 verse 1 to 3 says, Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the later times some would depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrine of devils.
[03:36:58.670 --> 03:37:04.872]  All this one safe, always safe, I can live in sin, I can act whatever I like, and Jesus still loves me, and it doesn't matter.
[03:37:04.912 --> 03:37:07.953]  Yes, Jesus loves you, but there's consequences to sin.
[03:37:08.394 --> 03:37:09.334]  It gives the devil
[03:37:10.134 --> 03:37:11.375]  Ability to mess up your life.
[03:37:12.076 --> 03:37:13.477]  So we should know that.
[03:37:14.117 --> 03:37:16.119]  Make sure that your conscience is not seared.
[03:37:16.399 --> 03:37:18.320]  Make sure that you allow God to be in your heart.
[03:37:18.861 --> 03:37:24.405]  And you know, remember that the Holy Spirit is still around to help you.
[03:37:24.925 --> 03:37:26.887]  That the Holy Spirit is here to help you.
[03:37:27.087 --> 03:37:28.828]  God did not leave us here by ourselves.
[03:37:29.329 --> 03:37:32.952]  Always call on the help of the Holy Spirit and ask the Holy Spirit to help you.
[03:37:33.352 --> 03:37:34.413]  To help you to stand.
[03:37:34.453 --> 03:37:35.774]  To help you to do the right thing.
[03:37:35.834 --> 03:37:37.795]  To help you to stay away from sin.
[03:37:37.875 --> 03:37:39.657]  And when bad things are happening to you,
[03:37:40.097 --> 03:37:41.998]  Cry out for the Holy Spirit to help you.
[03:37:42.058 --> 03:37:43.039]  He's our helper.
[03:37:43.479 --> 03:37:44.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:37:44.020 --> 03:37:52.185]  If you read in John 14 from verse 16, I think John 14 from verse 15 to 18, it talks about the Holy Spirit being our helper.
[03:37:52.565 --> 03:37:54.086]  God did not leave us here like orphans.
[03:37:54.146 --> 03:37:57.368]  The Spirit of God is here on earth with us, and He is here to help you.
[03:37:57.648 --> 03:37:59.810]  You have to ask, Holy Spirit, help me.
[03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:01.031]  Help me to walk right.
[03:38:01.091 --> 03:38:01.911]  Help me to pray.
[03:38:02.251 --> 03:38:03.632]  Help me to know you more.
[03:38:04.013 --> 03:38:05.053]  Protect me, Lord.
[03:38:05.333 --> 03:38:05.814]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:38:05.834 --> 03:38:07.395]  So you have to pray for yourself.
[03:38:07.995 --> 03:38:11.738]  And the other thing I'm going to say is that, like, right now we're talking about the election coming.
[03:38:12.279 --> 03:38:14.721]  We have to pray for God to intervene.
[03:38:14.901 --> 03:38:17.904]  When you and I start speaking, God will intervene.
[03:38:18.264 --> 03:38:21.607]  You see, the Bible says that God gave the earth to the daughters of men.
[03:38:22.228 --> 03:38:24.110]  It did not say God gave the earth to Christians.
[03:38:24.490 --> 03:38:26.291]  It said He gave it to the sons and daughters of men.
[03:38:27.012 --> 03:38:37.120]  So, if God gave the earth to the sons of men, that means God gave the earth to you and I. Also, Satanists, also demonic people, they are also human beings.
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:38.842]  They have authority over this earth.
[03:38:39.342 --> 03:38:46.748]  In fact, it is spirit in a dead body, in dirt, like dirt, like flesh, that has authority over this earth.
[03:38:47.148 --> 03:38:48.029]  So, think about it.
[03:38:48.449 --> 03:38:54.134]  When the devil starts cloning people and demonic spirits live in them, they can also have authority to speak over this earth.
[03:38:54.574 --> 03:39:01.438]  The reason why the devil is winning is because we're allowing the priesthood of the devil to have a louder voice.
[03:39:02.398 --> 03:39:14.304]  When the voice of righteousness, the voice of prayer, start rising up louder than the voice of sin and iniquity and all this debauchery that the devil is bringing, then we have a fighting chance.
[03:39:14.604 --> 03:39:20.047]  So I'm telling you as a child of God, if you've not given your life to Christ, just pray that Lord Jesus come into my heart,
[03:39:20.487 --> 03:39:21.728]  Forgive me of all my sins.
[03:39:21.788 --> 03:39:23.230]  Cleanse me from all unrighteousness.
[03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:25.072]  I make you my Lord and Savior.
[03:39:25.792 --> 03:39:30.056]  And you come into the Kingdom of God and start praying.
[03:39:31.198 --> 03:39:31.518]  Speak!
[03:39:31.978 --> 03:39:32.758]  Open the Bible!
[03:39:32.838 --> 03:39:40.060]  If you go on my ministry website, firepowerministry.org, firepowerministry.org, we have all kinds of prayers.
[03:39:40.100 --> 03:39:43.641]  You can pray for just every kind of situation that you're dealing with.
[03:39:43.901 --> 03:39:47.082]  We have all kinds of prayers that you can pray so that you can be strong and healthy.
[03:39:47.102 --> 03:39:48.082]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[03:39:48.142 --> 03:39:50.763]  So, I'm telling this to everybody because
[03:39:51.303 --> 03:40:01.846]  God gave you and I custody of this world, and we cannot allow the devil and his team of humans to take over the custody that God gave us.
[03:40:02.266 --> 03:40:10.988]  And if you refuse, if you and I refuse to take authority over the earth, the devil's people will take authority over the earth, witches, wizards, warlocks,
[03:40:11.528 --> 03:40:15.990]  All of them, all these Illuminati and everything, all these occultists, they will take over.
[03:40:16.230 --> 03:40:20.551]  You see what happened in the Olympics, you see what happened in Brazil, mocking Jesus and all that stuff.
[03:40:20.912 --> 03:40:27.354]  If you and I refuse to exercise our authority and speak over this world, the prevailing priesthood will win.
[03:40:27.374 --> 03:40:30.395]  Whether it's the priesthood of the devil or the priesthood of God.
[03:40:30.975 --> 03:40:35.457]  So remember, God is relying on you and I to make a decision.
[03:40:35.517 --> 03:40:38.138]  You see, if we bind, whatever you and I bind here on earth,
[03:40:38.678 --> 03:40:39.619]  It will be bound in heaven.
[03:40:39.699 --> 03:40:50.126]  If you and I refuse to bind, you and I refuse to decree, you and I refuse to speak righteousness, you and I refuse to speak life, then God cannot do anything until human beings speak.
[03:40:50.646 --> 03:40:53.448]  The devil is not supposed to do anything until human beings speak too.
[03:40:53.909 --> 03:40:58.752]  But of course the devil deceives people to fall into sin and then he can take over their life and mess up their lives.
[03:40:59.192 --> 03:40:59.753]  So my
[03:41:00.413 --> 03:41:07.719]  The good thing right now is that you and I have to come back to a place where we take custody over our world and speak life into our world.
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:09.441]  Speak life into our family.
[03:41:10.882 --> 03:41:11.483]  Pray prayers.
[03:41:11.603 --> 03:41:14.926]  We do a prayer space on Twitter on Sunday nights.
[03:41:14.986 --> 03:41:18.148]  You can see it on my Twitter handle, Stella underscore Emmanuel.
[03:41:19.090 --> 03:41:31.577]  We do a prayer space right there and then we really, you know, I also do, I preach every day through Rumble, not every day, I preach on Sundays and Wednesdays on Rumble, so you can listen to some of these messages so that you can grow spiritually and be able to stand and fight.
[03:41:32.157 --> 03:41:33.798]  Anyway, I'm about to get off, but listen.
[03:41:34.358 --> 03:41:38.000]  So, like I said, be spiritually prepared, financially prepared, physically prepared.
[03:41:38.461 --> 03:41:40.182]  Go to drstellarmd.com.
[03:41:40.842 --> 03:41:46.467]  Do an appointment, get your medicines, get your vitamins, get everything that you need.
[03:41:46.948 --> 03:41:53.374]  And remember, you and I can be strong and God is relying on you and I to make sure that we have a better custody of our world.
[03:41:53.734 --> 03:41:55.315]  Thank you and I'll be with you again next week.
[03:41:55.336 --> 03:41:55.796]  God bless you.
[03:41:55.816 --> 03:41:56.737]  This is Dr. Stella Emmanuel.
[03:42:07.628 --> 03:42:23.078]  I want to tell you the story, the history of Infowars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high-quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:42:23.918 --> 03:42:29.342]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of Infowars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:42:30.402 --> 03:42:38.964]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:42:39.305 --> 03:42:41.145]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:42:41.765 --> 03:42:46.287]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're in full wars.
[03:42:46.987 --> 03:42:52.668]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:42:52.688 --> 03:42:55.569]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:57.890]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:42:59.110 --> 03:43:15.123]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:15.503 --> 03:43:22.169]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:43:23.246 --> 03:43:23.787]  We're good to go.
[03:43:35.166 --> 03:43:43.250]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:43:43.330 --> 03:43:49.973]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:43:50.133 --> 03:43:52.614]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:43:52.794 --> 03:43:54.695]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:43:54.915 --> 03:44:04.683]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:44:05.323 --> 03:44:07.705]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:07.785 --> 03:44:08.826]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:10.507 --> 03:44:17.213]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:17.333 --> 03:44:22.999]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:44:23.099 --> 03:44:31.627]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:44:31.667 --> 03:44:33.748]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:44:33.769 --> 03:44:33.829]  And
[03:44:35.359 --> 03:44:48.644]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:44:49.144 --> 03:44:53.525]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:44:53.585 --> 03:44:58.227]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:44:58.547 --> 03:45:01.988]  At InfoWarsStore.com from InfoWarsMD.
[03:45:02.148 --> 03:45:04.488]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:45:04.588 --> 03:45:05.189]  It's amazing.
[03:45:05.329 --> 03:45:06.249]  It's super high quality.
[03:45:06.329 --> 03:45:08.189]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:45:08.289 --> 03:45:28.234]  Nitric Boost, good night's sleep, Joint Relief Max is amazing, Nerve Renew, Prostate Support, Probiotic Formula, CBD Full Spectrum, 25 milligram gummies, CBD Full Spectrum, 10 milligram gummies works great, Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Mushroom Max for mental clarity and your immune system, Superfood Greens, Ageless
[03:45:28.474 --> 03:45:28.974]  Thank you.
