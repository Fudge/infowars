[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:51.149]  It is Sunday, November 24th, 2024. I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:12.670]  All right, we are 56 days, 18 hours, 58 minutes, 48 seconds, the most important moment in modern American history, really in world history, President Trump not being president-elect, but actually being sworn in on the south side of the U.S. Capitol in the district of Mordor.
[00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.189]  Now, we have massive World War III developments, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:36.189]  France has announced that they're going to join the US and the UK in bombing with heavy precision missiles inside Russia imminently as they continue to try to stampede Russia into massive escalation because Russia has won the war,
[00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.370]  the proxy war so far, against NATO in the last two and a half years in Ukraine.
[00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:55.420]  As I broke days before it was mainstream news, Trump is in an ongoing rolling peace summit telephonically, remotely, but also in person at Mar-a-Lago with the head of NATO and others.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040]  A new European alliance was formed even if NATO agrees to a ceasefire.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.639]  There's a new alliance headed up by the UK and a whole bunch of EU nations saying that they're going to continue the war regardless.
[00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:17.949]  A lot of diplomacy going on, but also a lot of attempts at escalation.
[00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.509]  We'll go over all of that tonight.
[00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.210]  But I was thinking a couple hours before I went live today, just a few minutes ago at 4 p.m.
[00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:40.110]  Central, about philosophies and about where the world is right now, politically, culturally, with the Great Awakening that we're in the middle of, really the opening explosive stages of it.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:59.240]  And the fact that Trump's making a lot of good moves with some of his appointments, also some bad moves, you can't expect it to be perfect because Trump's not a Politico and it's always going to be a mixed bag, but it's much better than 2016. Definitely, Trump's vision is extremely educated now and hardcore,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.080]  and the alliance with Elon Musk is amazing.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.530]  And the world has awakened, so Trump is surfing in on that anti-globalist Populist eruption.
[00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.550]  That titanic, colossal, gargantuan eruption.
[00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:40.659]  But I was thinking about philosophies, and I was thinking about how to really get the philosophy of team humanity out there and to accelerate The Great Awakening and accelerate the populist realignment fast enough to get the globalists completely off balance and to defeat them quickly.
[00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.460]  And I was looking at what Trump's doing right now.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.639]  Obviously, he's trying to get a peace deal and he's trying to staff his government.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:00.520]  So he's been, compared to where he was frantically during the election, he's been dormant or you could say would appear on the surface is...
[00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.669]  Hibernating, but that's not the case, but comparatively it is.
[00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:21.990]  Who has not been hibernating is Elon Musk, and you can see that he understands by his aggressive, explosive actions, he understands what to do, and that's accelerate the offensive against the globalists.
[00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.660]  So we're going to be breaking that down in a moment.
[00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:29.839]  And the title of today's show at Real Alex Jones on X is Alex Jones Emergency Message to Elon Musk.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.500]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:31.439]  Stay with us.
[00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.540]  This is some very important information.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday.
[00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:51.800]  November 24th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.339]  There's the headline for the show tonight that I just wrote minutes ago before we went live on Infowars.com.
[00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.959]  Sunday live, Alex Jones' emergency message to Elon Musk, President Trump and the world.
[00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.899]  We must go on Total Offensive.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.279]  The Total Offensive now or the globalist now.
[00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:14.810]  That's what Paul Revere's do.
[00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.829]  That's how we override the globalists, the AI. That's how we win.
[00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.829]  Human power, human intelligence, human networks.
[00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.949]  All right, we have massive military World War III developments.
[00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.050]  We have huge political developments.
[00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.310]  We have incredibly important economic developments.
[00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.490]  We have globalist Agenda 21 developments still moving forward and Agenda 2030 to cut off our energy supplies.
[00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.990]  I am massively prepared today.
[00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.829]  We have big AI news and so much more.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.139]  And I'm going to get to all of it tonight in the next two hours.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.540]  Then Chase Geiser comes in 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.680]  for Sunday Night Live.
[00:05:55.019 --> 00:06:15.290]  But the first thing I want to get into is worldview, philosophy, and how we accelerate and secure Team Humanity's explosive takeover of the body politic and the focus and the consciousness of Of humanity.
[00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.430]  And I mean take over in a renaissance good way, unleashing it, freeing it.
[00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:32.529]  So let me first make The basic summation, and then I'll backtrack and go through just a snapshot of some of the evidence that I'd like folks to focus on, particularly Elon Musk.
[00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:39.050]  And I've talked to Elon Musk at length, and obviously I've watched his work, and now a lot closer.
[00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.750]  And I know he's extremely intelligent, so he doesn't really need me to tell him this.
[00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.569]  But I do want to encourage him and bring some of my perspective and views to it.
[00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:57.120]  And just encourage everyone to fully get behind what Elon Musk and President Trump and what I am doing here.
[00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:58.240]  All right.
[00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:10.069]  Everybody that's a regular listener, viewer of this show, the clips we put out that reach 80, 90 million people a day, Knows about the New World Order's philosophy.
[00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:27.050]  Neo-feudalism, making you poor, dumbing you down, controlling you, and then having a post-industrial depopulation world for the majority of people, and then a tiny globalist technocracy in governmental and corporate Many city-state reservations that are high-tech and advanced,
[00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.509]  and the rest of us are kept in a literal feudal state.
[00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:42.850]  These are really nasty, evil people, and if their plan continues to be carried out, it will cause global collapse, and clearly anybody that studies history or is intelligent knows that they'll never get away with it.
[00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.250]  They will just trigger mass war and the destruction of the surface of the planet bare minimum.
[00:07:47.889 --> 00:08:01.069]  So that agenda, the New World Order globalist agenda, the corporate BlackRock world government agenda, the anti-human, anti-exploration, anti-natalist agenda must be defeated.
[00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:03.389]  So I'm not going to spend time on the enemies.
[00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.250]  There's a bunch of new developments with them.
[00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.930]  Openly continuing to say ban farming.
[00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.069]  Cut farming by half or people will starve.
[00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.430]  Cut your leg off or you'll bleed to death.
[00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:16.069]  Drink cyanide or you might get poisoned.
[00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.589]  Blow your head off with a shotgun or you might die.
[00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:21.050]  It's upside down world.
[00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:31.610]  And they're banning range stoves and banning all RVs and just banning fireplaces and banning organic farming.
[00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.909]  I mean, they're attacking the family.
[00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.049]  You know what's going on there.
[00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.269]  Folks understand that.
[00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.509]  This clip came undone here.
[00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.539]  Damn thing always does that.
[00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:44.639]  I'm going to keep point.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.940]  So, that's the enemy.
[00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:55.460]  Their whole destabilization of the planet, their great reset, you know their operation.
[00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:59.559]  It's to make you as poor as possible so they can dictate the terms of your surrender.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.279]  That is slow death.
[00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:07.000]  Now, we can't just oppose...
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.240]  A globalist operation alone.
[00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.379]  Yeah, you've got to discredit it.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.980]  Yeah, you've got to fight it.
[00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:25.440]  But you also have to propose a different vision or a different idea or a group of visions.
[00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:30.460]  Because the best way to kill a bad idea is to have a better idea that's demonstrable.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:42.600]  Instead of us all being poor and eating bugs and being slaves to the globalists, In their 15-minute city prison grids, well, what would we propose in the alternate to that?
[00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:55.419]  And clearly, with President Trump and with Elon Musk, you have two people proposing prosperity and freedom in a classically liberal open society.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.600]  Not the modern liberal that means a technocrat slave master.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.679]  And the slaves.
[00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:08.620]  So there's a microcosm where we can look into this, and we'll do that in a moment.
[00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:21.580]  But first, we look at what President Trump's doing, and we look at the cabinet he's forming, and overall it's very positive.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:31.919]  But if we just sit here and count on President Trump doing it for us, or other populist leaders doing it for us, we're going to fail.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:51.120]  And if we allow Trump and other populist leaders to just get into power and then make deals with the globalists, I don't mean Trump himself, but the people he brings in, compromises, our agenda will not succeed.
[00:10:51.559 --> 00:11:13.090]  Because the globalist technocrats are masters at moving the Overton window to such an extreme, dystopic, death cult, And it's such a horrible system that we're always by increment trying to pull it away from that back towards a pro-human,
[00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:20.070]  innovative, amazing, exciting society.
[00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:35.259]  So the way you historically defeat Something like that is by completely rejecting it, exposing it, demonizing it, which isn't hard to do because it's super evil and corrupt and stinks to high heaven.
[00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.620]  And they know that, so they're just normalizing dystopia.
[00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:47.000]  New York Times, Washington Post, screw the First Amendment, ban free speech, head of NPR just came out and said the truth, gets in the way of things.
[00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.820]  We got a clip of her saying that the truth's our enemy.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:12:03.370]  They can't hide this anymore, so they're telling all their minions, hey, you want to stay in your little position as a functionary in our globalist cult, You've got to double down that we really are the bad guys.
[00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.250]  Okay, we've been exposed as the bad guys.
[00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.649]  That's fine.
[00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:11.750]  Instead of us backing off the tyranny that people are rejecting, let's double down.
[00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:18.409]  And we need all of our minions to realize that you are saboteurs of logic and success and freedom.
[00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:23.750]  And you've got to fully join the cult and fully go against your own interest.
[00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:25.070]  Or...
[00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:29.370]  You will be cut off.
[00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.769]  Well, you're going to be cut off regardless by this dystopia.
[00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.149]  So quit lying to yourselves that you're on a winning team.
[00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.049]  And I speak directly to the top globalists saying you'll never get away with these operations.
[00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.149]  You'll never get away with these plans.
[00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:47.409]  You clearly see it's going to cause mass war, starvation, and total collapse that you'll never be able to control yourselves.
[00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:51.629]  So it's a delusion that you're even attempting this.
[00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:53.029]  But moving off of that.
[00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:07.950]  What I'm saying needs to be done is revel in having the dying, collapsing establishment attack you.
[00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:18.409]  Whatever it is they don't want, whatever it is they tell you not to do, whatever it is they say is shameful and that discredits you is what they fear the most.
[00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:20.129]  And you think about that and you go, well, of course that's true.
[00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:23.269]  They're the ones saying there's no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:31.210]  They're the ones hunting our boys and girls, trying to hook them into a cult to sterilize them and destroy their future and basically kill their real identity and murder who they are.
[00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:37.450]  As Elon Musk said about his son, who was dead, who they captured, brainwashed, and killed as who he was, as his real identity.
[00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:46.710]  Just as Darth Vader ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became a slave of the Sith.
[00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:51.340]  So, that is a spiritual death.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.519]  Now, or a death of the consciousness of what it truly was.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.039]  And that's what this system is.
[00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:15.240]  It needs you to go against your primary function and what you're designed to do, which is be free and open and have a free will and innovate and empower others, but clearly within the confines of your original genetic structure,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:29.639]  which is infinite, Within the consciousness or electrochemical corridors of its design.
[00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:34.480]  But only through that design is the gateway to the infinite available.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.620]  And the globalists don't want you to be infinite.
[00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:40.039]  They don't want you to be able to stare into infinity and consciously understand infinity.
[00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:45.259]  They don't want you to understand true knowledge because that empowers you.
[00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:47.019]  They want you in their cults.
[00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:48.580]  They want you in their mind viruses.
[00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:52.509]  That destroy your potential, as Elon Musk has rightfully said.
[00:14:54.070 --> 00:15:09.610]  And so, what I'm getting at here, because there's a trillion different ways to say this, there's so much knowledge, it's hard to impart it through spoken word, is being a maverick, being a trailblazer,
[00:15:09.769 --> 00:15:15.350]  being an innovator against this system is the only way.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:22.059]  Because the system is designed to destroy human empowerment and creativity.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.539]  And so the only way to defeat that is to totally reject it.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.820]  You can't make deals with it.
[00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:30.120]  You can't negotiate with it.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.480]  You can't have detente with it.
[00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:43.759]  You can't even try to have it capitulate because it never really will because it wants total income power.
[00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:48.000]  And control over consciousness and over free will.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:54.620]  It is going against the true prime directive that is being a sentient conscious being.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:04.220]  And so a lot of articles came out today and a lot of talk about it when Elon Musk...
[00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:14.830]  Commented on some posts last night saying, you know, you should buy Infowars or you should buy MSNBC. And he said, yeah, how much does it cost?
[00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.850]  And he's interested in that.
[00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:20.129]  And people would then say, well...
[00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:22.490]  Alex Jones has been discredited.
[00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.029]  Well, Alex Jones has not been discredited.
[00:16:24.169 --> 00:16:35.970]  Alex Jones has been demonized and attacked and straw men have been built by PR firms on record and the government and the CIA and the Justice Department on record because they feared the populism of it.
[00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:37.490]  They feared the optimism of it.
[00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:41.429]  They feared the fact that I'd studied their own documents and their own plans.
[00:16:42.049 --> 00:16:52.769]  And so what I was telling people wasn't my predictions, it was their roadmap and their blueprint for domination, not just over the world and over things, but over our very minds.
[00:16:54.789 --> 00:17:02.610]  And so the commenter said, Autism Capital, Alex Jones is about to have the most interesting twist of fate.
[00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:18.579]  Trade offer, I receive Infowars, you receive MSNBC. And of course, that's speaking to the false claim that Bloomberg and his Everytown group that financed all of this with the Justice Department that now admits that they run the onion.
[00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:21.680]  And this has all been Bloomberg and Soros.
[00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.420]  It's all in the news now.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.460]  Trying to take me off the air for seven years.
[00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.319]  The statement is, okay, you've seized Infowars.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.019]  Musk will buy MSNBC and trade it for you.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:48.839]  And then Musk put up two burning fires saying either you could say both things are on fire or he's on fire for that idea.
[00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:54.119]  Well, he's made nice comments about Infowars and Things like that in the past.
[00:17:54.279 --> 00:18:00.359]  And I know he sent his lawyers into our case to block what the left's trying to do, to even say they own my name.
[00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:08.519]  So it's clear to me, and he can obviously elaborate on this with any public statements or post, that no, he's saying that that is a great idea.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.559]  But let's just be clear.
[00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:24.220]  That accepts the lie that the Onion, now a week and a half ago, really the Everytown Bloomberg group, Buy it at auction, which they didn't do.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.220]  The judge hadn't authorized that auction.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:34.359]  The judge said it didn't happen two Thursdays ago and shut it down.
[00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:40.539]  And now there's a status hearing tomorrow and then a full evidentiary hearing to be announced tomorrow where they're going to get in a lot of trouble, I believe.
[00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:51.039]  And you've got the Everytown people that own The Onion Saying they own Infowars, trying to confuse people right now on their website.
[00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:57.839]  They even got my site, Infowars.com, taken down for a day until they heard the judge the next day say, you can't do that.
[00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:00.500]  So, of course, they dropped it like a hot potato and got out of the building.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.420]  And we were back on in the studio the next day.
[00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:04.799]  So that's a major scandal.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.380]  But let's move on from that.
[00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:13.430]  I didn't use this example of myself so I could talk about myself here.
[00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.150]  This is just a front and center example of what I already see Elon Musk doing.
[00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.609]  So let me state it this way.
[00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:45.759]  As soon as Trump won on November 6th, as soon as it was announced in the early morning hours at 1.27 Central, Musk immediately went on the offensive against the UN and the NGOs funding the open borders and the human trafficking.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.339]  He immediately went on the offensive against the globalists and their carbon taxes.
[00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:53.700]  He immediately went on the offensive against all their plans to cut off our energy.
[00:19:53.819 --> 00:20:02.140]  He immediately went on the offensive with them trying to accelerate World War III and start heavy bombing, which they did, of Russia.
[00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:20.009]  He immediately has gone on the offensive against On Jeffrey Epstein and P. Diddy and the sex trafficking, he immediately went on the offensive against the globalist power structure itself and went on the offensive supporting the best pro-human,
[00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.970]  anti-globalist candidates for nomination into Trump's cabinet and government.
[00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:32.829]  So again, when I say this is an emergency message to Musk, It's really a message to everybody here because Musk already knows all this.
[00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.410]  I'm just pointing out what I see that other people aren't commenting on that I've seen or realizing.
[00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:43.849]  And what Musk is doing is an example to Trump of what he needs to do.
[00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:49.990]  We do not need the Trump administration to go in there and play footsie and try to make deals with the globalists.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:21:09.380]  Only by keeping them off balance and rallying the people and moving the Overton window from the death cult, from deindustrialization, from the collapse of civilization, from depopulation, where they've taken us way off a trillion miles into left field, you don't just move it by increments and argue with them and debate them.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:29.869]  You fully expose them and then you challenge them With major innovative announcements and actions and slashing government budgets and slashing globalist bureaucracies and defunding NPR and defunding PBS and green lighting all the lawsuits against the transgender cults and putting all your people in the agencies.
[00:21:31.049 --> 00:21:32.230]  And then...
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:44.099]  The other big corporations and groups that have been in line under the ESGs and BlackRock and their corporate social credit score governance will run even faster to jump ship than they already are.
[00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:49.059]  And so as a litmus test, I said weeks ago, I don't want to be the press secretary.
[00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:53.940]  I don't want to live in DC. I don't want to sit there and talk to the idiot fake news all day.
[00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:54.839]  But it would be fun.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.799]  It would have top ratings.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.880]  I said I'd do it for a month if Trump was serious.
[00:21:58.039 --> 00:22:00.259]  But that was Don Jr. just putting that out there.
[00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:23.890]  He said he was serious to show they're dead and to show they're discredited and to show the guy you said was the most evil, liar, fake news, disinfo in the world is way more accurate than you and we don't buy your lies about him and anyone you attack and demonize we know is over the target so we're going to celebrate anyone you've come after just like President Trump or Elon Musk.
[00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.529]  And once we start celebrating and defending our champions this is really common sense, isn't it?
[00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.650]  Who the bad guys hate.
[00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:38.769]  That's when we really win because we set the agenda.
[00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:44.869]  And again, you do that by not trying to move the globalists off their positions by increment.
[00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.509]  You do it by trailblazing and leading.
[00:22:48.779 --> 00:23:04.759]  And by doing things like buying MSNBC, even if it doesn't have a big audience, it's got the cable rights to be on all the channels on satellite and TV. And it would become the number one channel within just a few months with Musk at the helm.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.200]  It would blow Fox away.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.859]  He could use the human intelligence of X, the real news, as he said.
[00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:21.319]  With all the feeds and all the reporters and all the people with just having basic traffic cops that are hosts that would just direct you to breaking news and clips live on air.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.460]  It would be days ahead of the corporate media.
[00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:35.150]  It would be incredible, and it would end up bringing even cable TV and satellite TV back only on that channel to its previous glory.
[00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:42.529]  You would easily have 30, 40, 50 million viewers an hour because, I mean, Elon Musk goes on with Trump and has a billion listeners.
[00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.349]  Remember that?
[00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:50.049]  And I go on some days 50, 60 million just watching me on X. Most days 20, 30 million.
[00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:52.130]  You're just on the live feeds.
[00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.529]  So, yeah.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:02.559]  But more importantly, just using those studios and infrastructure and reporters Who themselves are just teleprompter readers.
[00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:06.859]  You get rid of the leftist operatives, but you tell the others, hey, we know you're mercenaries.
[00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:13.819]  We just want you to report and talk to citizen reporters and have a wide spectrum of information and real debate.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.700]  And you can even have some of them.
[00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:26.240]  But then there's plenty of people from X and other systems that have proven themselves as real minds and entertaining that you would then bring on to that network as well.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.079]  The...
[00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:35.460]  X news network powered by open human intelligence.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.980]  Something along those lines.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.660]  And people power inside.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.859]  Powered by the people.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.380]  Not just funded by viewers like you.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:44.759]  No, no, no.
[00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.980]  Powered by people like you.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.200]  And celebrating...
[00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:59.690]  The citizen journalist, which is just as important as somebody at the New York Times, or more important because we aren't beholden to somebody else.
[00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.910]  So use that as an amplifier.
[00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:10.809]  So obviously, he should buy MSNBC and make it MXNBC or whatever.
[00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:19.750]  And yeah, I mean, I had people ready to come in and just pay quite a bit of money for InfoWars.
[00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.309]  And I said to him, I said, it's going to be a rigged auction anyways.
[00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:26.230]  Let's just let them rig it with a low number.
[00:25:27.349 --> 00:25:29.210]  I told people this officially, even set it on air.
[00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:31.789]  And I said, they won't let a bigger better do it anyway.
[00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:33.630]  So let's just demonstrate that first.
[00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.150]  And then we can have the real fight after that.
[00:25:37.309 --> 00:25:38.549]  And they walked right into our trap.
[00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.950]  And so, yes.
[00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:46.869]  Does Elon Musk, has Elon Musk reached out and said he'd buy it?
[00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:52.579]  Well, I'll just leave that to Elon Musk.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:00.319]  So, and of course, the ex-affiliates, groups, people.
[00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:05.019]  So, the decision was made to let Bloomberg do all this.
[00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:06.259]  We knew it was Bloomberg a long time ago.
[00:26:06.339 --> 00:26:07.519]  Soros threw some money into it.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.579]  We have all the documents now.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.180]  And we just wanted to get them in and let them demonstrate all this first.
[00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:15.200]  And they took the bait.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.880]  And they did a great job being who they are.
[00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:22.319]  Which is bad people.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.380]  And so we're not in the old world anymore where people like Bloomberg and Soros can just have a free hand with the American people.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.920]  That's over.
[00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:33.940]  So I'm going to come back and quantify this philosophy a little bit more and really cut to the chase.
[00:26:34.099 --> 00:26:38.259]  But yeah, we need to double down and be who we really are.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.220]  And that's what's sexy and that's what's fun and that's what's truthful and that's what's powerful.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.460]  That's what people want.
[00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:48.569]  And just flaunt And promote whatever the globalists hate.
[00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.490]  So of course he should buy MSNBC and make me the main anchor.
[00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.049]  Alright, let me simplify this.
[00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.049]  I know most of the listeners understand me, but in case some folks don't.
[00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:20.339]  We have been bullied by the corporate media for 80 years since the end of World War II. We have been dumbed down.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.400]  We have been poisoned.
[00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.519]  We have been psychologically attacked.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.799]  And those documents and statements are all on record.
[00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:36.720]  And Trump wants to empower us and give us a good attitude about ourselves and raise our morale the opposite of demoralization.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.500]  And that's exactly what Elon Musk is doing.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.339]  And there's a choice.
[00:27:41.539 --> 00:27:46.500]  Have a dystopic nightmare society or an open, free, empowered, competitive, vibrant society.
[00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:48.940]  So I'm totally behind Elon Musk.
[00:27:49.099 --> 00:27:50.819]  I'm totally behind President Trump.
[00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:54.019]  This is a real revolution you're seeing everywhere.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.160]  And humanity is hard to enslave.
[00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.500]  The globalists got really, really close.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.900]  And we haven't won yet, but we've turned the tide and we've got a good shot at it.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.619]  If...
[00:28:07.089 --> 00:28:13.069]  We set the agenda and do the opposite of what they try to tell us not to do.
[00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.970]  I mean, that's so simple.
[00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.009]  So, yeah, Trump should make me the White House Press Secretary.
[00:28:20.349 --> 00:28:26.049]  I don't want to be the White House Press Secretary, but I want Trump to do stuff like that.
[00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:31.430]  Like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of HHS. That's a bold, good move.
[00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.369]  We are being poisoned by design.
[00:28:33.369 --> 00:28:34.529]  It's declassified.
[00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.950]  We are being sterilized.
[00:28:37.089 --> 00:28:39.230]  We're the only country that allows atrazine to be used.
[00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:44.369]  The allowable amount bends the gender, screws people up, destroys your fertility, gives you cancer.
[00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.650]  Got big articles on that today.
[00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:47.589]  We need more of that.
[00:28:48.569 --> 00:28:52.630]  Tulsi Gabbards is the head of the Director of National Intelligence.
[00:28:52.829 --> 00:28:54.269]  Yes, that's the type of stuff.
[00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.009]  Elon Musk is the example, just blasting them.
[00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:08.329]  Continually devastating leftist mind virus narratives, which is on the run, which is being toppled.
[00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:14.369]  And as he said last night in the post, splintering off and running off their own little cult ecosystems.
[00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.049]  He says that's where the death throes are happening.
[00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:18.069]  Here, he said it better than me.
[00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.910]  Here's the actual post.
[00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:37.339]  And it says, Elon Musk said, the obvious final survival attempt of the woke mind parasite, which cannot stand the light of truth, is to splinter off the central consciousness of X to smaller, isolated group minds.
[00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:39.960]  There, you can witness its death throes.
[00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:43.079]  And that's what's happening.
[00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:51.539]  And it's not right to let them run off their little cults where they'll be fed on by their cult programmers.
[00:29:53.119 --> 00:30:04.720]  We have to, through truth and love and example and justice, continue to expose it, and we can actually free, over time, many of the people that have fallen to the cult of the mind control.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:11.480]  Maybe even Elon Musk's son, who they currently have killed, his consciousness, can be saved.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.640]  A lot of people are being saved.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.079]  I've had family.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.819]  I'm not going to say who, but similar.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.880]  Not a son, but...
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:36.000]  The other thing that fell to it for four years and is back and is deprogrammed and is a huge Trump supporter and is awake and understands it now.
[00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:39.079]  And so it can be done.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.039]  And it wasn't the exact same attack, but similar.
[00:30:44.319 --> 00:30:45.519]  And so...
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.920]  You send your child to private school, public school, they lie, they don't tell you what they're doing.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.640]  This is a cull.
[00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:59.059]  Because they can't get the adults or people that have had some experience in most cases, so they target children.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:08.519]  That's why drug dealers try to hand out free drugs to 12-year-olds or 10-year-olds on the playground, and then later, hey, rob your mom's jewelry, and I'll give you some really good stuff.
[00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.150]  That's a quick story.
[00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:11.910]  I never used really hard drugs.
[00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.930]  I mean, I tried this once, tried that once, and I was like, people pay for this.
[00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:21.490]  Tried cocaine a couple times in junior high, actually, and it gave me such a horrible hangover the next day.
[00:31:21.569 --> 00:31:22.569]  I was like, how does anybody take?
[00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.710]  I didn't even like how many feel.
[00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:27.990]  Tried meth a couple times, thought I got up for two days and vomiting after that.
[00:31:28.089 --> 00:31:28.730]  I was like, who the hell?
[00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.069]  But I did smoke pot sometimes.
[00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.369]  And I remember there was this guy in the neighborhood that I'd known since I was like five.
[00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:36.710]  He was like five years older than me.
[00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.809]  So at the time I was like, you know, 12, he was like 17, 18. He was a drug dealer.
[00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.089]  And, you know, he dropped out of school and stuff, but he was the cool kid driving his black Transant around.
[00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:50.470]  And I remember when I was like 11 or 12, he was like, hey, want some marijuana?
[00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:51.630]  And I was like, oh, I want to be cool.
[00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.470]  Sure, I'll take it.
[00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.029]  Here it's free.
[00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:56.970]  And then I remember like six months later, he's like, hey, why don't you try this cocaine?
[00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.890]  And I tried it and felt horrible.
[00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.490]  And he came around a few days and said, hey, you want more?
[00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:01.890]  I said, no, I don't want more.
[00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:03.069]  He goes, no, no, no, have some.
[00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.990]  Trying to get me to smoke crack.
[00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:05.809]  And I was like, nope.
[00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:09.650]  And I'm sitting in the car with him, literally down the street from my house.
[00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.869]  He's like, oh, you're not cool, whatever.
[00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:13.529]  Come on, why don't you?
[00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:15.529]  And I said, I don't have any money.
[00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:19.529]  And he goes, well, does your mom got any diamond earrings or anything?
[00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.950]  And I said, screw you, man.
[00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:25.549]  I got out of the car and never did hard drugs again.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.599]  But the point is, that's how drug dealers do it.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.500]  He wanted to get me on hard drugs and have me rob my parents.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.859]  And my mom did have diamond earrings.
[00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:41.420]  But the point was, so that he could do that.
[00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:50.480]  And I later learned, you know, some of the cheerleaders and stuff in the neighborhood, that he dated them and got them to rob their families.
[00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:52.900]  I later talked to their parents years later.
[00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:54.579]  So I'm kind of telling a story.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.799]  Most of you have similar stories.
[00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:58.859]  That's what the transgender thing is.
[00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:09.200]  Literally going in, confusing children, telling them they're something else, and then say, don't tell your parents, and inducting them into a peer pressure system of control, and then saying your parents are against you.
[00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.039]  Break off contact.
[00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:10.819]  They're bad.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.200]  We're your family now.
[00:33:12.339 --> 00:33:13.680]  That is a cult.
[00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:17.619]  A evil, sick cult that doesn't just want to physically rape your child.
[00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:18.859]  That's bad enough.
[00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:23.200]  They want to physically drug them or mutilate them surgically.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.140]  In a death cult, I mean, that is a form of human sacrifice.
[00:33:28.779 --> 00:33:34.279]  Destroying someone's procurative ability is a form of genocide.
[00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:38.619]  So, this is serious.
[00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:47.890]  And we have to go on the offense against this, against the corporations, the companies, the hospitals that are bragging they're going to make hundreds of billions of dollars off this.
[00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:50.470]  We have to attack this on every front.
[00:33:50.569 --> 00:33:52.170]  And Elon Musk has skin in the game.
[00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.509]  He's experienced it.
[00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.069]  And I talked to so many parents.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.099]  And they go, we send our daughter or our son to a nice Christian private school, like Trinity here in Austin.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:17.980]  And they didn't even, I've talked to two different parents, that their children in elementary school came home and said, oh, you know, kids can have two daddies, two mommies, a girl can become a boy, and they go into the school, and the school's keeping it secret from them, because the school...
[00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.280]  Even the big Christian schools are doing this.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.000]  They're getting massive grants to do it, and the cult isn't telling you.
[00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:27.219]  And it's done in public schools.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.380]  It's done everywhere.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.300]  But every time this hits the news, people say, get your kids out of public schools.
[00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:33.079]  It's everywhere, people.
[00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:37.900]  Elon Musk put his son in a super fancy, you know, elite school.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.139]  They didn't tell him any of that, and then they brainwashed him.
[00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:43.289]  And then turn him against him.
[00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:52.130]  So I keep going back to Elon Musk because if they would do it to the richest man in the world, folks, I mean, I would mess with anybody's kids, but the richest guy in the world?
[00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:58.110]  See, so they're targeting our children, and I'm not saying something you don't already know.
[00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.070]  You're like, yeah, we already know that.
[00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.869]  Okay, well, what are we going to do about it?
[00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.469]  They're not going to give us quarter.
[00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.550]  We can give them no quarter.
[00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:11.889]  We have to go absolutely all out Against these people.
[00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:14.190]  I mean, what is the leftist movement worldwide?
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.710]  White people are inherently bad, so you need to bow down to a black person.
[00:35:18.849 --> 00:35:30.530]  But that black person is George Soros-funded Black Lives Matter that says, in the nuclear family, sterilize males, promote communism, promote the globalist agenda.
[00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:32.829]  So they use a black person as the figurehead.
[00:35:32.909 --> 00:35:33.949]  Bow down to this black person.
[00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.690]  You're bad to them.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.900]  And then you bat on that black person, but it's really not a black person.
[00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:48.280]  It's George Soros and the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA and MI6 and the Tavistock Institute and serious psychological warfare neuroscience brainwashing.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:36:01.539]  I was talking to a neuroscientist today and he was talking about having to leave as an academic Brown University.
[00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:13.010]  Because at that higher level, it was just admitted that they were there running a psychological warfare cult operation on the people that were about to be, you know, the new leading scientists in the country.
[00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:24.710]  And it was just so intense to be a neuroscientist and understand all this, the psychology, the psychiatry, the physiology, the brainwaves, and to just get into the higher level.
[00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:26.630]  And it's like, well, of course we're a mind control cult.
[00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:30.730]  And then if you don't want to join it, well, you don't get a job here.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.980]  Or you don't get a job with the big corporations.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.559]  So this is a serious central issue.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:52.030]  And so it's not just trolling The globalist for Don Jr. to say I should be the press secretary.
[00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.269]  It's not just a big F you to them.
[00:36:54.409 --> 00:36:55.570]  It's not just a big joke.
[00:36:56.289 --> 00:36:59.510]  It's if you understand that the people want that.
[00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.090]  The people want things like that.
[00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:08.889]  The people want this cult to be called out and not to be humored and not to be confronted in half measures.
[00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.510]  I mean, you know all over the Western world...
[00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.070]  They don't just put biological men in the girls' bathrooms.
[00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.570]  They don't just put the adult coaches showering with the little girls.
[00:37:18.929 --> 00:37:28.889]  They don't just have men to women, quote, transitioners in the UK in women's prisons strip-searching the women, as was announced this week.
[00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.570]  They are...
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:51.159]  Literally going into the elementary schools and the preschools and putting these cult members, these pedophiles, who don't just want to rape your child, they want to rape them of their essence, of their biological future.
[00:37:51.739 --> 00:37:56.039]  So I cannot state it simply enough or more complexly enough.
[00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:57.579]  There's so many angles to this.
[00:37:58.929 --> 00:38:09.809]  That in the spirit of doubling down and in the spirit of who has been targeted by the deep state and hated, whoever that is, you need to champion.
[00:38:09.809 --> 00:38:14.510]  And I champion all the people that are against the globalist.
[00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:23.219]  I told you four years ago when Joe Rogan was first moving to Austin, I said, I know Joe personally for 20 plus years.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:37.320]  He's really awake, but he's trying to figure out how to do it the right way to be able to get as many leftists as he can to wake up by them basically thinking that he's still on their team partially while he deprograms them.
[00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:40.559]  And now you see that's the case.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.960]  And I told you four years ago, watch Elon Musk get really hardcore against the globalists.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.480]  I know for a fact, from people very close to him, that he is super awake and has decided to go full out against these people.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.519]  And you saw that happen.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:10.239]  So, it's not that Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk And President Trump are trying to program you to follow their worldview.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.719]  It's not that Alex Jones is adopting their worldview.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.199]  It's like they live.
[00:39:16.199 --> 00:39:20.780]  You put the glasses on as the metaphor for being able to see behind the veil.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:29.139]  And we're just all being conscious and being aware and not being naive and studying the globalists how they operate.
[00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:32.539]  So then you're looking at the same thing together.
[00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:48.969]  Then you're organizing together to oppose it however you can, and to rally others to deprogram, to be deprogrammed, and come out of the mind control, show that they're not in a cult anymore, and can join an open free, free will society, team humanity.
[00:39:49.969 --> 00:39:55.309]  And so I see the comments everywhere because I'm so energetically supportive of Trump and Elon Musk.
[00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.269]  And people say, oh my God, you've joined Elon Musk, you've joined Trump.
[00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.550]  I don't say this to sound powerful because it's the opposite.
[00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.250]  I'm very humble.
[00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.789]  But I've been on air 30 and a half years.
[00:40:07.809 --> 00:40:12.690]  25 years ago, I was already reaching 10 million people a day.
[00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.849]  At peaks, I've reached 150 million people a day.
[00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:20.250]  My films have been seen billions of times.
[00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.809]  I currently reach conservatively 100 million people a day.
[00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:31.269]  I know anywhere in the world listeners and walk down the street, listeners are everywhere.
[00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:43.769]  And so I just want to explain something, not because it matters who woke up first or who was doing this early on at the largest scale of anybody else before me.
[00:40:44.949 --> 00:41:01.809]  It's just people need to understand the power of the individual and the power of action and the power of just a guy on AXS TV 30 years ago and local radio 28 years ago and syndicated 27 years ago and everything we've done is that I'm not getting orders from Elon Musk.
[00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:04.489]  I'm not getting orders from Donald Trump.
[00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:07.170]  I'm not giving them orders.
[00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.230]  There's no central committee planning operation.
[00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:13.150]  We are inspiring each other.
[00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.090]  They have knowledge I don't have.
[00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.010]  They have perspective and skills I don't have.
[00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.130]  I have knowledge and skills and understanding they don't have.
[00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:40.610]  Together, collaboratively, in the information war, using the weapon of truth, we see the threat of the globalist death cult, and we are united in our love of humanity and our shared destiny of expanded consciousness throughout the universe and free will.
[00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:55.710]  And so we are the counter, just like CNN, MSNBC, have been going, oh yeah, Trump and Musk and Vivek Ramaswani and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan are the new superheroes.
[00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:59.090]  That's the new talking point, because I know the public can kind of capture that in their mind.
[00:41:59.449 --> 00:42:02.670]  But they're not the good guys, they're the legion of doom.
[00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.889]  Well, let's be 100% clear.
[00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:09.050]  The prominent big dogs...
[00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:15.610]  From RFK Jr. to Tulsi Gabbard to myself that are fighting the New World Order by every yardstick.
[00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:28.190]  If you look at what we stand for, we're the Justice League and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and King Charles and John Kerry and Yuval Noah Harari are the Legion of Doom.
[00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:30.269]  They say the future isn't human.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.300]  We need to get rid of the people.
[00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:34.300]  We need a post-human world.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.260]  We need a post-industrial world.
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:43.280]  They are trying to cut off your energy and fertilizer and food and brainwash your children to hate themselves and not want to procreate.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:49.199]  So by every objective, scientific, economic, cultural yardstick...
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.960]  We are the Justice League.
[00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:53.539]  You are the Justice League.
[00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:55.280]  We are Team Humanity.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:03.760]  And the New World Order makes the Legion of Doom, led by Lex Luthor, look like choir boys.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.980]  And that's what I keep trying to explain to people.
[00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:24.260]  The archetypes of Thanos wanting to kill half the galaxy's or universe's population, in Endgame, the movie, Inspired by, I was told by the people that wrote it, my film, Endgame,
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:33.239]  2007, is a reflection of what's really happening and what the different forces are.
[00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:43.960]  And Thanos sees an end to the universe with the potential expansion and believes he's got to kill half the beings so that the universe survives.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.119]  Well, that's Isaac Asimov and the Foundation series.
[00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:56.510]  We have to create a dark age to create a final infinite golden age because we've got the mathematics to show it.
[00:43:56.829 --> 00:44:05.389]  No, that's the excuse to dominate and kill and not innovate, and that's the old feudalist model of depopulation to make people controllable.
[00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:13.710]  And Plato wrote in his Republic, we should not have the unwashed masses crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.199]  And Malthus and all these depopulationists, this is not new.
[00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:30.179]  So I represent, you that support us represent, Elon Musk represents, Donald Trump represents a pro-human future.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.260]  Now those futures may vary, and they do.
[00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:41.440]  And as we learn more, we can shift our views in our navigational directive.
[00:44:45.059 --> 00:44:49.360]  That comes from the ethos of human will.
[00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:52.219]  But the globalists don't want innovation.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.500]  They don't want mavericks.
[00:44:53.639 --> 00:44:54.820]  They don't want free will.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.760]  They don't want competition.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.940]  They don't want empowerment.
[00:44:57.159 --> 00:45:01.840]  They want stagnation, serfdom, feudalism that they can rule.
[00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:04.119]  They call their plan neo-feudalism.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.300]  Keep the earth in harmony.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.300]  500 million that they control.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.840]  So this is the real world.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.960]  What I've been exposing is from their own statements and plans and operations.
[00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:20.199]  And I'm here saying, I don't believe humanity will want to be part of this.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:26.820]  I don't believe you want to be slowly poisoned and dumbed down and made an MPC or kept an MPC from birth.
[00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:33.000]  I think if you know the truth and are empowered, a rising tide of consciousness raises all ships.
[00:45:33.199 --> 00:45:34.880]  I believe in you.
[00:45:36.019 --> 00:45:37.579]  I want to see you empowered.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:54.030]  And I can see clearly That that's what more and more people want, what more and more people understand, and that's what we're promoting.
[00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.750]  And so it's really that simple.
[00:45:56.969 --> 00:46:06.670]  So, of course Elon Musk should buy MSNBC. Of course he shouldn't just put my content on there.
[00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:10.210]  He should have a disclaimer that this is free speech, this is people's opinions.
[00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:19.849]  And it should be a giant free-for-all and it will be the most popular thing ever to the 65 and up who have not been exposed to the internet yet.
[00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:33.210]  And they will be and it'll be like a portal into the internet, a portal into X, a portal into freedom, a life raft To them and to those in the cult to get them out.
[00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:42.250]  And yes, it's not because I want a show on MSNBC. The average MSNBC show has less than a million viewers.
[00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:52.789]  Just this show on X tonight will guarantee conservatively have 10 million viewers, probably 20 million.
[00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:54.730]  Because Sunday nights aren't as big.
[00:46:54.869 --> 00:46:55.630]  Tomorrow, 40 million.
[00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:57.030]  That's just the live show.
[00:46:59.409 --> 00:47:01.969]  The clips today will have 30, 40, 50 million.
[00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:06.289]  Hell, if I sat up here until 10 o'clock at night taking each little clip out and putting them up, we'd have 500 million.
[00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:07.449]  I mean, I know that.
[00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.369]  We've had days where we've had 150 million.
[00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.849]  And it's everywhere else, too.
[00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:26.630]  So again, freedom is popular, but the symbol of taking over MSNBC, the symbol of...
[00:47:27.889 --> 00:47:34.630]  Putting a prime time show on with a round table with Alex Jones debating other people.
[00:47:34.789 --> 00:47:36.269]  Put leftists on there and they'll come.
[00:47:36.869 --> 00:47:40.530]  Put the transgender cult on there and tell us there's no X and Y chromosomes.
[00:47:40.789 --> 00:47:42.269]  I'll debate Bill Guy the science guy.
[00:47:42.449 --> 00:47:43.289]  It'll be hilarious.
[00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:48.710]  We can debate Niels de Grice Tyson about how horrible having a human space program is.
[00:47:48.909 --> 00:47:50.269]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:56.329]  It will show them for who they are and it will be incredibly wildly entertaining.
[00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.110]  And it's the symbol that humanity's back.
[00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:26.190]  And it's the symbol of, oh, you feared Alex Jones because he was reaching 40, 50 million people a day in 2016, 17, 18. And so you deplatformed him off everything, lied about him, Had every town Bloomberg fund lawsuits run by the Justice Department and the CIA on record against me to then raise hundreds of millions of dollars off my name,
[00:48:26.409 --> 00:48:42.909]  saying I was persecuting these people for their dead kids so they could play victim, and then raise money for two years, over $100 million they admit, off my name, then sue me claiming I made money off them when I made zero, lie about what I did to them, have judges find me guilty before a trial,
[00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:58.929]  have show trials produced by HBO. To try to take a populist folk hero person that really loves humanity and silence me so I couldn't speak and then build a straw man avatar that they could use to discredit the liberty movement.
[00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:14.809]  If that isn't resuscitated and rehabilitated and taken from the wreckage and rebuilt as a signet, as a logo, as a tower, as a sentinel, as a celebrated beacon.
[00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.929]  Against the enemy, then that is a great lost opportunity.
[00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:19.789]  But here's the good news.
[00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.869]  The Phoenix does not need to rise from the ashes because it never fell.
[00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:28.989]  Because it isn't Alex Jones, it's the audience of activists that understood that, that kept us on air.
[00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:38.369]  And during all the demonization and attacks, it made us more popular, more underground, more avant-garde, more maverick, more trailblazer, more innovation.
[00:49:40.550 --> 00:50:00.349]  Until even the general public had to recognize what had happened, and now I get 99% love everywhere in the most leftist areas of the country and the world, and no weapon formed against us shall prosper, as the good book tells us, and it has been an incredible adventure to be in the jaws of this monster,
[00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:08.269]  and to not just survive, but to come out stronger, as Friedrich Nietzsche said, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:50:10.599 --> 00:50:12.199]  And so this is the journey.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.079]  The hero's journey.
[00:50:14.159 --> 00:50:15.480]  And all of you are on it as well.
[00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:18.360]  And all of you that supported us and stood with us, you are the heroes.
[00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:19.460]  They didn't break your will.
[00:50:19.659 --> 00:50:20.840]  They didn't mind control you.
[00:50:21.019 --> 00:50:22.239]  You didn't cut and run.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.420]  And here we are weeks after they said we closed.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.119]  Weeks after Bloomberg owns us.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.960]  But Michael Bloomberg does not own us.
[00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:30.039]  And that's who it is.
[00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:31.500]  I have the documents I'll be exposing all tomorrow.
[00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:34.880]  Because we stayed in the fight.
[00:50:36.219 --> 00:50:38.340]  And there'll be more and more attacks and more.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.920]  And even if they strike me down physically, we just get bigger.
[00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:41.639]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:46.260]  But if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.599]  We're going to go to break.
[00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:49.119]  I'm going to come out with all the military news.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.739]  France announcing strikes on Russia.
[00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:55.059]  Trump's ongoing, Mar-a-Lago, Peace Summit, and more.
[00:50:55.139 --> 00:51:01.340]  But if you want to keep us on air, even if they take this over, which I don't think they're going to be able to, Elon Musk is supporting us and coming into the case, already has.
[00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.539]  TheAlexJonesStore.com is not owned by me.
[00:51:03.619 --> 00:51:04.340]  It's a great sponsor.
[00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:07.139]  The Backup Network, they're funding that, plus the products are incredible.
[00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:12.619]  Patriot Apparel, the very best supplements, Ultimate CMOS, and more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.179]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.619]  That's the coordinates of great products and being the tip of the spear.
[00:51:19.699 --> 00:51:27.079]  Well, the winner, Chris DeLauro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:28.199]  What an amazing aircraft.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.860]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.679]  Thanks for the support.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.219]  I love you, Alex.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.460]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:39.219]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.480]  Just being in this studio, I never imagined I'd be.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.440]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[00:51:42.519 --> 00:51:43.119]  You're the reason we're here.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.340]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.019]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:58.079]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here.
[00:51:58.219 --> 00:51:59.059]  You get to beat Alex.
[00:51:59.059 --> 00:51:59.860]  You get to be on the show.
[00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:02.440]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.500]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com, enter your email, join the VIP club.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.019]  I promise you next week, you'll be very excited.
[00:52:09.239 --> 00:52:10.260]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:13.300]  Check out the new truck at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:52:21.039 --> 00:52:27.199]  All right, I'm going to spend five more minutes on human consciousness and breaking the back of the globalist once and for all.
[00:52:28.009 --> 00:52:29.889]  The back is just shaking.
[00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.409]  It's tenuously holding.
[00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:32.849]  It's about to be broken forever.
[00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.210]  But we can't give it time to heal.
[00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:36.710]  And there's no violence in that.
[00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:39.150]  We just have to focus for the truth.
[00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:40.369]  And we have the initiative.
[00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:41.690]  We've turned the tide completely.
[00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:49.329]  We have to drive them politically against the rocks and crush them into a trillion pieces so they cannot reconstitute.
[00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:50.769]  It is literal cancer.
[00:52:50.949 --> 00:52:54.449]  It is the mind virus that Elon talks about so much.
[00:52:54.449 --> 00:52:55.510]  It's a perfect name for it.
[00:52:56.269 --> 00:53:12.610]  So, When you've got the initiative and when everything's going your way, you obviously have to accelerate that and not let up.
[00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:15.059]  And our enemies aren't going to let up either.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:23.920]  And that's why you don't sit there with milquetoast and platitudes and go, well, we're in power now.
[00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:25.679]  Let's just take over the old system.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.820]  No, we have to remove the corrupt elements of the old system and then rebuild a new one.
[00:53:31.159 --> 00:53:41.969]  And that's what explodes economies just from an economic perspective as well is innovation, new developments, These are all just common sense things.
[00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.010]  People are like, yeah, we already know this.
[00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:45.130]  Okay, well, let's put it into action.
[00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.429]  And that's what Trump and Elon Musk are doing.
[00:53:48.369 --> 00:53:55.989]  So here is the head of NPR, Catherine Mayer, saying truth is a distraction.
[00:53:55.989 --> 00:53:58.309]  And you see this all over the corporate dead media.
[00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.710]  They said if Trump won, it would mean they were dead and had no power.
[00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:03.610]  No, it would have meant you were able to steal it.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.179]  Like he did in 2020, because he really won then.
[00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:09.500]  You were already dead.
[00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:12.639]  You were already dead to the majority of people's eyes.
[00:54:12.739 --> 00:54:13.579]  You were already discredited.
[00:54:13.639 --> 00:54:14.559]  You were already a joke.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:23.059]  You already were a negative impact on your power structure, where whatever you said, the public figured it was the opposite.
[00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:28.119]  So all that globalist money propping you up, the corporate media has been dead for a decade.
[00:54:29.969 --> 00:54:40.210]  But they hadn't figured it out, and their old backers like Bloomberg and Gates and Zuckerberg hadn't figured it out yet.
[00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:44.090]  And so now they're openly saying, oh my God, everybody hates us.
[00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.949]  Nothing we do works.
[00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:46.710]  We've got to get people's trust back.
[00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:49.869]  And they do that with more lies and then with censorship.
[00:54:51.469 --> 00:55:00.309]  And with all these attempts at criminal charges against Musk, but the federal court just ruled on Friday in a big federal investigation to the SEC that Musk was innocent.
[00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:11.409]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, if you want people to stand up against tyranny, you've got to champion them and you've got to back them.
[00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:20.150]  And I will just say briefly before I play this clip, I've had more friends and family the last 48 hours Call me.
[00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:20.969]  Well-known people.
[00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:23.409]  Hell, I had Rogan call me last week.
[00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:24.869]  So are you on the air?
[00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:25.510]  Are you off the air?
[00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.070]  And I'm like, well, you watch the show some, don't you?
[00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:27.670]  Yeah, well, I see.
[00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:30.070]  It looks like your studio, but they say you're shut off.
[00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.670]  I said, that's a lie.
[00:55:30.769 --> 00:55:31.489]  He goes, my God.
[00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:32.789]  They'll send me all that.
[00:55:32.889 --> 00:55:33.510]  That's incredible.
[00:55:34.269 --> 00:55:35.230]  Because it is incredible.
[00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:40.070]  Even though we know they lie, to say we're shut down, to say the building's turned off, to say we're not here.
[00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.409]  And I had family call me yesterday and today saying, well, what are you doing now?
[00:55:47.979 --> 00:55:49.000]  Since Infowars is shut down.
[00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:50.719]  I said, no, the judge said it didn't go through.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.480]  They're in a lot of trouble and Patriots bought it, but they cheated and give it to them.
[00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:55.599]  They're probably going to get indicted.
[00:55:56.659 --> 00:55:57.460]  And they're like, really?
[00:55:58.119 --> 00:55:58.739]  I'm like, yeah.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.900]  Did you go watch the show?
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.860]  Don't you see the websites up?
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:01.659]  Yeah, I saw that.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.980]  I wondered if that was your new studio.
[00:56:03.139 --> 00:56:03.900]  It looks like your old one.
[00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:06.079]  And then I'll just say the guy's name.
[00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:06.739]  He's a friend of mine.
[00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:11.920]  I've known him because he moved in next door to me like 12, 13 years ago.
[00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.989]  I've since moved from there.
[00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.650]  My ex-wife got the house in Dripping Springs, but he still lives there.
[00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:17.130]  I'm friends with him.
[00:56:18.849 --> 00:56:19.750]  Jesse James yesterday.
[00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:23.210]  I was like, hey, man, so are you still doing your show?
[00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:23.650]  What happened?
[00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:24.449]  They took a rim for us.
[00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.269]  And I said, well, I mean, I'm still here.
[00:56:26.469 --> 00:56:27.130]  He said, oh, great.
[00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.309]  Well, let's go hang out.
[00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:29.269]  I'm like, hey, why don't you come on the show?
[00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:31.010]  I hear you're watching a new TV show.
[00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.710]  Oh, you saw that?
[00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:32.190]  Yeah, sure.
[00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.909]  I'll come on this week.
[00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:33.150]  Great.
[00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:34.150]  Okay, come on.
[00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:35.030]  Come on Tuesday.
[00:56:37.139 --> 00:56:40.980]  So, I mean, I'm having to still sit here and explain all this to people.
[00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.639]  So, they still have the power to hoax.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.760]  They still have the power to get to say just such a giant lie that people believe it.
[00:56:51.219 --> 00:56:53.860]  And so everybody, let everybody know, we're on the air.
[00:56:54.019 --> 00:56:54.639]  They lied.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.539]  And Bloomberg was behind it.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.900]  Bloomberg tried to take over Infowars.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.480]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:05.119 --> 00:57:10.059]  All right, we're into hour number two on this live Sunday, November 24th, 2024 transmission.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:22.679]  And I want to get to the big economic news, the military, World War III news, and a bunch of political news here in just a few minutes.
[00:57:22.679 --> 00:57:25.159]  But I want to finish up with what I just did in the last hour.
[00:57:26.139 --> 00:57:27.119]  It's about philosophy.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:30.380]  It's about competing world visions and world ideas.
[00:57:31.369 --> 00:57:36.369]  Now, the world's waking up at a very fast pace, and it's the hottest thing in the world right now.
[00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.610]  Populists are being elected everywhere.
[00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:38.690]  Globalists are the most hated.
[00:57:40.369 --> 00:57:42.050]  It's wild, and they admit that.
[00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.449]  The Davos group in other places, they say, we're almost totally hated.
[00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:45.190]  We're falling apart.
[00:57:45.409 --> 00:57:49.570]  All these leaked UN official videos come out undercover saying everybody hates us.
[00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:50.130]  We're criminals.
[00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:51.210]  We're child traffickers.
[00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.849]  The NIH, everybody hates us.
[00:57:53.929 --> 00:57:54.849]  We killed a bunch of people.
[00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.150]  What are we going to do?
[00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.150]  And their answer is, we'll just censor everybody.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.079]  Well, that's not going to work either because people are already awake.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.179]  So now you're creating a bigger Streisand effect trying to take it away.
[00:58:06.159 --> 00:58:24.039]  So every major corporate publication from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, to Atlantic Monthly, to CNN, to MSNBC, all these zombie media companies that have been dead a long time, almost no viewers, massive negative connotations when they say something the majority of people believe the opposite.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:29.159]  So they're a detriment to the dying, collapsing power structure, a major negative.
[00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:35.039]  And so all they've got now is time to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.519]  Time to get rid of free speech.
[00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:38.420]  I mean, just, you see the headlines every day.
[00:58:38.639 --> 00:58:45.039]  And now the head of NPR came out in a speech a few days ago and said, you know, the truth gets in the way of things.
[00:58:45.039 --> 00:58:47.739]  It's a distraction, said Catherine Mayer.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.780]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.760]  But, and Elon Musk made the point, we need to defund NPR. Yeah, 50 years ago.
[00:58:55.730 --> 00:59:02.550]  Total establishment, globalist foundation, new world order, anti-human, anti-freedom, monopoly, garbage.
[00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:16.130]  But I'm going to say this again because in the last three days, Musk potentially buying Infowars, Musk buying MSNBC has trended the top of it and everywhere else.
[00:59:17.429 --> 00:59:34.449]  Over and over and over again, and it's one of the hottest topics out there, And so I want to explain this because I see this everywhere by people that hate me on the left who are infected by the mind virus and by populists and patriots.
[00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:41.969]  They say, well, has Alex Jones gone under the control of Elon Musk and Donald Trump?
[00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:46.170]  Is Alex Jones with us?
[00:59:47.469 --> 00:59:48.269]  What's going on?
[00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:52.389]  Elon Musk doesn't tell me what to do.
[00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.110]  Donald Trump doesn't tell me what to do.
[00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:55.650]  My wife doesn't tell me what to do.
[00:59:55.769 --> 00:59:57.170]  My listeners don't tell me what to do.
[00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.510]  My family doesn't tell me what to do.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.739]  I listen, and I take their advice a lot, family and crew.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:20.300]  But I'm here to expose things, and I have enough respect for you to go research what I'm saying, find out it's true, have your own perspective and knowledge on it, maybe even give me knowledge back that takes my understanding to a higher level, which is what I'm looking for.
[01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:25.039]  And I am here, I'm saying it again, this is so important, because if you understand this, you understand how the world works.
[01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:27.480]  I'm trying to get people to have a...
[01:00:28.159 --> 01:00:35.239]  Learning experience here, and I think most of you get this, but for those that don't, I'm trying to get people interested in how things work.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:41.460]  I'm trying to inspire people to believe in humanity and get engaged in team humanity.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:51.840]  And I'm trying to inspire the general public and major leaders in government, in corporations, in art, in culture.
[01:00:52.659 --> 01:00:54.780]  Because I think people are like me.
[01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:58.880]  I think people want freedom and free will and justice.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:06.360]  And I know humanity can do anything we want with the potential we've now developed.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:29.340]  Technologically and culturally, if we don't have technocrat globalists in charge who admit they're threatened by open free societies and threatened by innovation, and as Elon has said, try to use the whole patenting system to block innovation and create a stagnant system of what they call disruptive technology.
[01:01:33.179 --> 01:01:47.059]  So I want to get out of the doldrums of this mini dark age we've been in, where we have incredible technological development, but it's so far is just a shadow of what it would have been if it wasn't being suppressed.
[01:01:48.239 --> 01:01:52.639]  And we've definitely had a cultural dark age of the mind virus.
[01:01:53.849 --> 01:02:03.829]  More depressed, more physically sick, more dumbed down, more politically illiterate, more mathematically illiterate, more illiterate when it comes to chemistry.
[01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:13.050]  And systems and human nature and street smarts, that is a danger to everyone and is disgusting.
[01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:14.690]  And it's not leadership.
[01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:20.309]  When you try to dumb people down so you can be in charge, that says you're a loser.
[01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.789]  That says you don't have real vision.
[01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:24.730]  That says you're a joke.
[01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:27.670]  That says you're betting against our species, damn it.
[01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:29.250]  And I'm a fan of humanity.
[01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:33.889]  And I'm a fan of the potential we have and that God made us.
[01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:44.389]  Guys, pull up the Devil's I'm a Fan of Man speech from Devil's Advocate with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves.
[01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.630]  It'll be on YouTube.
[01:02:45.949 --> 01:02:47.130]  I'm just guessing the name is.
[01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.030]  Devil's Advocate, I'm a Fan of Man or Devil's Speech.
[01:02:52.489 --> 01:02:58.550]  Al Pacino's Devil's Speech in that movie.
[01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:00.510]  Devil's Advocate.
[01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:01.150]  Excellent film.
[01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.809]  I need to watch that again.
[01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:08.159]  Now, How does the devil kill people that he can't get to join him that are good?
[01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:12.079]  He makes them depressed and makes them give up on life and gets them to kill themselves.
[01:03:12.739 --> 01:03:16.840]  You kill yourself culturally by hating yourself because you're white or black.
[01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:25.659]  You hate yourself culturally and spiritually and energetically and consciously by believing that humans are bad for the earth and we all need to just die.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:33.539]  And so you may not even actually kill yourself physically, but you kill your will and your vision of yourself and you're demoralized.
[01:03:34.239 --> 01:03:44.440]  So he kills Connor Reeves' wife by getting her to kill herself, by getting her to hate herself and to be depressed and scared and giving up.
[01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:58.860]  And then he tells the young lawyer he wants to join him, who's like the Christ figure, who doesn't understand that, that I'm a fan of man.
[01:03:59.019 --> 01:03:59.960]  I'm giving you everything you want.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.420]  I'm here.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.400]  I'm the reason you have fun.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.599]  Join with me.
[01:04:02.679 --> 01:04:03.639]  But no, he's really not.
[01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:05.989]  A fan of man.
[01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:07.829]  God created us.
[01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.570]  God is the fan of man.
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:21.889]  And God made us in his image to be able to have consciousness and free will and experience development in that process.
[01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:28.050]  So are you for humanity?
[01:04:28.369 --> 01:04:29.670]  Are you a fan of humanity?
[01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:32.949]  Do you like seeing other people do great things?
[01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.449]  Or does it make you feel bad?
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:43.610]  Because I grew up and thought if somebody's got a really hot girlfriend or a really cool car or can play a guitar really good, I thought, man, good for them.
[01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.449]  That's amazing.
[01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:56.250]  You know, when I see Elon Musk, obviously the greatest engineer, I mean, he's done more than even people in the last 200 years.
[01:04:56.769 --> 01:05:01.829]  I mean, I think it's clear to say Musk has done more technologically than Thomas Edison or even Nikola Tesla.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.940]  You can say, well, they didn't have as much technology at their time than he has now.
[01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:07.199]  Whatever you want to say.
[01:05:07.559 --> 01:05:11.219]  Now he's innovated X and got Trump elected.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.019]  It was the game.
[01:05:12.099 --> 01:05:12.760]  I mean, you know, come on.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.840]  Yeah, he's the maverick.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.300]  And they always attack it and say he's not the maverick.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:23.960]  Just recognize it when it's there and celebrate it and know that it's to all of our positive futures and that it empowers us all and a rising tide raises all ships.
[01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:34.170]  Stop staring at the strongman in the arena and then, oh, he stumbled, look at that, when you're not even setting foot close to the arena.
[01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:39.289]  You're not even close enough for any of the dust getting kicked up to maybe hit you in the face.
[01:05:40.809 --> 01:05:43.030]  You're not even in the stands at the arena.
[01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:48.710]  You're already climbed into your grave down the road at the cemetery.
[01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:51.210]  So, again...
[01:05:52.630 --> 01:06:06.989]  Those of us that love innovation and rebel and celebrate other people's success, as long as it's not at our expense, and if somebody's better than me in business or life or culture and is more popular, I love that.
[01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:14.909]  But if they do it by suppressing me and dominating me and attacking me and lying about me, then I've got a problem.
[01:06:15.929 --> 01:06:20.110]  You can have anything you want, you just better not take it from me, from the Guns N' Roses song.
[01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:26.590]  That's the choice we have.
[01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.969]  And that's where we are.
[01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:31.809]  And it's never been more clear.
[01:06:32.929 --> 01:06:38.630]  And so I've never sat up here and said, why isn't Trump defending me?
[01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:44.550]  I told him back when I got deplatformed, I said, they admit on CNN and MSNBC, this is a model for you.
[01:06:44.889 --> 01:06:48.989]  And Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck and Joe Rogan.
[01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:52.519]  And I said, watch, you'll get banned off X too, Trump.
[01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:54.099]  Now he gets it.
[01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:57.659]  And I understood he had big political fights and I'd been so demonized.
[01:06:57.659 --> 01:07:01.099]  They charged up such a black sheep devil image of me.
[01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:08.480]  And he was so in battle that if they thought they came to my aid, all that demonization of me would then carry over to them.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:15.659]  But if Trump would have had that attitude coming to my aid then, he never would have...
[01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:25.769]  Been defeated, which he wasn't defeated in reality, but they had enough fraud to overpower his moderate win, not his massive landslide.
[01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:27.929]  But see, it's okay because the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:55.099]  It was going through that whole processes and being deplatformed and being demonized and being attacked and truly only being supported by the grassroots and the quote little people who really are the big people that I was able to really go through that outlaw underground Process of exile to then begin my return.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:11.320]  And my return, because I never left, is a return in people's minds and their consciousness, understanding the thing that the system feared, the thing that they lied about and demonized and celebrated attacks on me and my family, was because they feared the energy,
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:18.140]  the spirit, the consciousness that was contained within the work I was doing with myself and the crew and our guest.
[01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:21.329]  And it was the thing that the enemy feared.
[01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:24.609]  And so it is the thing that should be celebrated.
[01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:27.670]  But it couldn't be celebrated too early on.
[01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:35.510]  And I didn't even understand that fully then, though I did understand it more than others even do today.
[01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.630]  But now I didn't just know it.
[01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.550]  I didn't just historically understand it.
[01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:45.470]  I didn't just energetically, consciously experience it.
[01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:48.750]  Now I've seen it fulfilled.
[01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:58.909]  And I see things that I've announced would happen fulfilled faster and faster and faster and faster because I'm totally immersed in this.
[01:08:59.010 --> 01:08:59.909]  This is what I do.
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:12.680]  And I see Elon, as he's fully gotten into the information war, For just a few years, already surpass my skills in it.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.180]  Not just in his reach, but in his delivery and his understanding of it.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.140]  I'm learning a lot.
[01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:20.819]  And I don't see anyone else doing it at that level.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:32.939]  And imagine, this is a guy running dozens of giant companies himself, and then having the time and the information war to then up his game to an unparalleled level while doing that.
[01:09:33.539 --> 01:09:35.380]  That is another thing we should celebrate.
[01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:59.869]  And in his current trajectory of just the information, not just the reach, but the information, he's already himself deploying the best information, the most accurate, the most game-changing, the most piercing, and it's getting better by the day at an existential growth curve that then I feed off of in my own innovation of understanding and that you feed off of,
[01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:08.050]  and that is the It's a genesis wavelength of expanding rapid consciousness and development.
[01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:13.529]  So, we're on the edge of something really big.
[01:10:13.649 --> 01:10:23.289]  That's why we can't let them have World War III, no kidding, and a nuclear war to get in the way of that, because these are very exciting times, and they do have a lot of life extension technology.
[01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:27.670]  That when properly deployed, can extend life another 100 years easily.
[01:10:27.949 --> 01:10:38.609]  And if you can extend another 100 years, even another 50, very easily it'll be life extension that is beginning to border on immortality.
[01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:42.529]  And that's the main globalist project.
[01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:44.369]  Dumb everybody down, depopulate.
[01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:47.270]  They don't want technology to be fully deployed.
[01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:49.369]  They think somebody else will get it, we'll destroy ourselves.
[01:10:49.550 --> 01:11:00.850]  But in their process of trying to take the Promethean of Fire away from everybody else, they are lighting the fuse for civilizational collapse that will engulf them.
[01:11:00.989 --> 01:11:08.529]  So their plan to cut off civilization because it's too dangerous and only keep it for themselves has lit the fuse to destroy civilization.
[01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:12.970]  Because people aren't going to be denied this.
[01:11:14.619 --> 01:11:15.699]  Now, there can be laws.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.939]  There can be a lot of things.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:27.439]  I would suggest very strongly, and so a lot of other smart people, that the really incredible stuff can only be allowed in space and at a great distance.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:42.279]  And so, if we're successful, and we will be, people are going to look back in 50 years and say, can you believe we almost blew each other up and didn't do this?
[01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.029]  So we need goals.
[01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.850]  We need focus.
[01:11:48.090 --> 01:12:00.670]  We need collective visions of an expansive, aggressive, amazing space program, but also free energy programs and all of it.
[01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:02.470]  And people say, oh, that's a lot of tax money.
[01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:03.069]  No, it's not.
[01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:04.090]  It's pure research.
[01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:07.250]  The tax money is used to sterilize little boys and girls.
[01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:09.970]  The tax money is used to drop bombs on villages.
[01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:11.930]  That's all needs to go away.
[01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:24.670]  And then it needs to be government, individuals, corporations, everybody invested in these innovations in their will and in their word of mouth and in their finances.
[01:12:24.909 --> 01:12:28.850]  And then everybody gets a big piece of the new renaissance.
[01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:32.470]  Renaissance to infinity.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.300]  Total expansion.
[01:12:34.619 --> 01:12:36.720]  The future is certain.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.520]  And expansion is always here.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.579]  Not, the future's uncertain and the end is always near.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.239]  No.
[01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:54.140]  Innovation is certain.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.720]  Expansion is certain if we just don't blow it up.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.720]  And that means not just nuclear war, but the mind virus.
[01:13:05.779 --> 01:13:08.680]  They want to make you obsolete so you're not part of the future.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960]  That's arrogant.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:10.760]  That's greedy.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.619]  That's fearful.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.560]  That's small.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:13.779]  No.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.640]  We will inspire the world.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.159]  We will inspire humanity.
[01:13:18.399 --> 01:13:24.880]  We will lift up humanity with God's vision and take humanity to the next level.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.579]  We've got to do it!
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.899]  And you've got all these small minds and people out there that are going to try to stand in the way of this.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.760]  And regardless of what happens, we are to occupy the earth.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.500]  We are to be fruitful and multiply.
[01:13:42.539 --> 01:13:51.000]  And we are to go forward no matter what's going to happen in the future or what the devil's going to do.
[01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:54.220]  And there obviously will be a time when Satan gets full control for a moment.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.079]  But we're building our innovation, our ideas, our systems.
[01:14:00.619 --> 01:14:06.380]  Because the devil wins for a few minutes in the fourth quarter, but he loses in the fourth quarter.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:17.680]  And my job is to promote humanity and promote families and promote health and truth and children.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:26.300]  And my job is to get you to not be demoralized and to believe in yourself and the God that made you.
[01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:32.899]  And my job is to fight these anti-human scumbags that want you dead.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.279]  And that's simple.
[01:14:34.479 --> 01:14:46.579]  And I believe in you and I bet on you for 30 years and I've had an articulated vision for 30 plus years and now the whole world is Alex Jones.
[01:14:48.659 --> 01:15:08.600]  The most popular ideas, the expanding consciousness, the awareness to the New World Order, to the globalists, to the technocrats, to their evil plan, to their death cult, is the hottest thing everywhere because it is the answer to their 1984 tyranny.
[01:15:09.899 --> 01:15:12.359]  1776 worldwide and interplanetary.
[01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:15.659]  So you've...
[01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:18.449]  Got to understand that, and this isn't thinking big.
[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:22.329]  Look how far we've come technologically in the last hundred years.
[01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:37.729]  This is going to look like a snail going along a forest path on a leaf compared to unleashing human innovation and potential.
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:41.289]  We're made in the image of God.
[01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:43.890]  Read Genesis.
[01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:48.239]  The eye is not seen, the ear is not heard, but God has a store for us.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.500]  And God helps those who help themselves.
[01:15:55.039 --> 01:16:00.220]  So I want to get into the military news, and I want to get into all that, but I just wanted to give people not even a pep talk.
[01:16:00.539 --> 01:16:15.840]  I'm here giving you a real assessment of where the world is today, and there's all these fake political movements and all these spin-offs and rabbit trails and distractions, but I have been covering for decades and decades and decades The globalist documents, their plan,
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:32.039]  their operation, the fact that they've gotten a lot of it done and you don't want them to get the rest of it done, and that we could have an alternate plan and we could challenge this and we could say no, and I thought it would be pretty easy once the globalists went into operational mode, like you saw in 2000,
[01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:48.090]  that I told you decades ago they would do in 2000, when they went from Agenda 21 to Agenda 2030, when they went from their official plan in Rio de Janeiro at the UN in 1992, All of that was Agenda 21, and then in the year 2020, they go into Agenda 2030, and you read that thing,
[01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:52.729]  and it is the most dystopic, diabolical, hate letter to humanity.
[01:16:53.029 --> 01:16:57.470]  It is the most sick, exterminist, anti-human crap.
[01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:00.449]  And you see it all around you.
[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.590]  Oh, we're going to ban half the farming, or people will starve to death.
[01:17:04.949 --> 01:17:07.890]  Again, we're going to slit our throats, or we'll bleed to death.
[01:17:08.979 --> 01:17:12.479]  I'm going to pour gasoline on myself and light it on fire or I might burn my finger.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:30.159]  It's just illogical, psychological gaslighting, just programming you with the most insane mind virus so you're looking at world leaders who are not your leaders, who are your enemies, just feeding you pure cobra poison to totally demoralize you and make you give up.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.399]  But we're not going to do that.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.720]  And you notice...
[01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:37.449]  We're turning the tide.
[01:17:37.649 --> 01:17:38.529]  We have the initiative.
[01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:39.229]  We're winning.
[01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:55.510]  And all the people that bet against humanity, all the globalists that sold out to the satanic system, they are now afraid and their power is draining away and more and more people hate them and know who they are every day.
[01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:59.550]  And the hunted are becoming the hunters.
[01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:02.869]  But we don't want to sterilize their kids and poison them.
[01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:18.189]  We just want to get them out of control of the levers of power and then decentralize everything, have everything completely transparent and open, and then we can have By the knowledge of the crowd and adoption of technology,
[01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:20.989]  what is the best for us and what we're going to do?
[01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.210]  And it's not some utopia we're offering.
[01:18:23.369 --> 01:18:31.149]  It's not some exact perfect plan, except it's God's plan of free will and empowered human society.
[01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:41.270]  And that compared to what they're selling is like fresh, delicious strawberries and cream versus a glass of cyanide.
[01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:50.329]  King Charles says we need a global military government with a military operation to save the earth and stop human activity.
[01:18:50.329 --> 01:18:59.550]  A global government at war with humanity, at war with you, a declaration of war against your very biology, against who you are.
[01:18:59.789 --> 01:19:04.750]  So delusional, they say they're going to transcend and become this new cyborg super sapien.
[01:19:07.479 --> 01:19:11.220]  And by contrast, I'm not even against technology and life advancements.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:23.939]  They're deploying all the technology to say it's the end of humans instead of something individuals choose to empower humans.
[01:19:25.789 --> 01:19:27.390]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back.
[01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:30.270]  I'll get to the clips, I said, and then I'm going to get into the French announcing.
[01:19:30.489 --> 01:19:31.109]  You already knew this.
[01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:32.470]  I told you more countries will start bombing.
[01:19:32.789 --> 01:19:35.050]  I said last week, by next week, the French will start bombing.
[01:19:35.369 --> 01:19:37.670]  They're trying to trigger World War III to stop our plan.
[01:19:38.289 --> 01:19:40.569]  And it's totally insane.
[01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:41.970]  We'll get to all of it coming up.
[01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.390]  Stay with me.
[01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:49.770]  But my hand was made strong.
[01:20:02.619 --> 01:20:03.840]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:04.119 --> 01:20:04.460]  All right.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:11.880]  I got to move quick now because there's so much news I haven't gotten to, but I just wanted to talk about the different visions for the world.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.640]  And if you don't have a vision, well, the globalists are going to co-opt you.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.960]  And I'm open to everybody else's visions and ideas, but I believe in humanity and we're an incredible species.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.680]  We can do such amazing things together.
[01:20:26.619 --> 01:20:29.680]  And I'm here to inspire everybody.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.899]  I'm here to be inspired by you.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:38.920]  And it's very clear that humanity wants freedom.
[01:20:40.899 --> 01:20:45.640]  And so, I tell you what I believe is the truth, what is the most accurate information.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:48.079]  I'm in charge of everything I say.
[01:20:48.279 --> 01:20:49.079]  I'm my own man.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.619]  And I want other people to start thinking like that.
[01:20:55.479 --> 01:20:59.819]  Because when I was covering the New World Order 30 years ago, maybe 1% of people knew about it.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.439]  Now the world's awake and saying, we don't want that.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.060]  It's that simple.
[01:21:06.899 --> 01:21:07.680]  Okay, great.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:08.800]  That's half the equation.
[01:21:09.199 --> 01:21:10.420]  What do you want?
[01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:15.970]  And I think we should start talking a lot more about what that is.
[01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:29.949]  And yeah, Donald Trump's lower taxes, more security, less crime, more peace, loving your country, not being demoralized.
[01:21:31.529 --> 01:21:32.229]  That's good.
[01:21:33.529 --> 01:21:36.630]  But we need innovation and we need goals.
[01:21:37.369 --> 01:21:39.649]  And people that don't want to be part of those goals, that's fine.
[01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:55.840]  But by leadership, Most people will join us and we can do anything for our future progeny and for ourselves now.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.500]  But you must be the captain of your own mind.
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:05.500]  And I'm just here to get people to understand there is a war on for your mind.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.399]  Infowars.
[01:22:07.039 --> 01:22:08.920]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:15.449]  And a perfect example of that Is they tried to illegally take this place over a week and a half ago?
[01:22:15.609 --> 01:22:16.250]  We said no.
[01:22:16.489 --> 01:22:17.729]  Judge said it wasn't authorized.
[01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:18.350]  Killed it.
[01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:24.649]  And people tune in and go, why are you still on air?
[01:22:24.729 --> 01:22:25.970]  We heard you were shut down.
[01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:39.510]  And we've seen, it's come back some, a 50% at least cut in people buying products at thealexjonesstore.com because people think that's owned by Bloomberg, who...
[01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:46.449]  Runs the Everytown Democrat gun control group that is using The Onion as their front group, and I'll cover that all tomorrow.
[01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.470]  But I mean, talk about a mind virus.
[01:22:51.409 --> 01:22:53.130]  I don't own the AlexShieldsStore.com.
[01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:54.029]  That's our sponsor.
[01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:58.649]  That's funding the AlexShields network if this does get shut down, and that's the main sponsor for InfoWars.
[01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:03.510]  So go there.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.899]  None of it goes to these people.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.960]  It funds me staying on air.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:08.760]  I need your help.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.100]  We had enough money to operate, not a lot of extra, as I told you a few weeks ago.
[01:23:13.699 --> 01:23:14.899]  Now, this keeps going.
[01:23:17.279 --> 01:23:20.560]  It'd be like if somebody came and told your wife, oh, your old baby's dead.
[01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:22.579]  And the baby wasn't dead.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.500]  The baby was, you know, in a bedroom, in a crib.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.420]  Well, let's go.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.819]  Let's go to Hawaii.
[01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:28.800]  You get on a plane and fly out.
[01:23:28.859 --> 01:23:29.399]  Nobody's in the house.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.180]  The baby does die.
[01:23:31.859 --> 01:23:33.000]  I mean, I have a better analogy.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.440]  It's just like, Ridiculous.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.439]  But that's how the lies work.
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.159]  Everybody knows the corporate media lies.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:48.439]  But still, sometimes they can put a big enough hoax out that people believe it.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.300]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:56.539]  2008, I get up at like 6.30 in the morning, and I turn on CNN cable.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.079]  I'm flipping through.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.859]  CNN says, Russia has invaded Georgia.
[01:24:00.729 --> 01:24:01.710]  And I look at all the headlines.
[01:24:01.909 --> 01:24:02.449]  They've invaded.
[01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.970]  They've invaded.
[01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:06.609]  And I drive into the office, read a bunch of news articles.
[01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:08.850]  Nowhere was the truth there.
[01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:11.090]  I wasn't even...
[01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:14.050]  RT didn't exist yet, or it wasn't something I was looking at.
[01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:16.170]  And I went on air at 11 a.m.
[01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:18.250]  and said, man, this is crazy.
[01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:19.810]  Russia's invaded Georgia, blah, blah, blah.
[01:24:20.369 --> 01:24:22.069]  I'm a lot less naive than I was then.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:27.680]  And then I started taking calls an hour into the show, and callers were like, hey, you need to read Der Spiegel.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.899]  You need to read Le Figaro.
[01:24:29.119 --> 01:24:30.039]  And it wasn't German.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.579]  I mean, it wasn't Russian news.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:49.399]  It was those articles about West accries Russian aggression, but it said in the articles, oh, yeah, the Georgian troops attacked Russian bases on the borders overnight, and the Russians responded by rolling in and pushing them back from the border.
[01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.189]  And then I went and looked at the Russian news, and there was the truth.
[01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:58.949]  And then days later, it was, you know, on CNN. Well, yeah, the Georgians attacked them.
[01:24:59.649 --> 01:25:02.689]  But they were saying the Russians were conquering Georgia.
[01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.750]  And I ran on air and was just reporting it.
[01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:13.189]  And see, because it's like, oh, they're going to say Russia invaded, and it's not, you know, I mean, come on, that lie's too big.
[01:25:14.289 --> 01:25:16.770]  You know, Alex Jones' company was sold to The Onion.
[01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:21.369]  And the judge said, I never authorized an auction.
[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:22.550]  I said, what could happen in the future?
[01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:23.750]  We've got to have hearings about it.
[01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:24.829]  I didn't even know this was here.
[01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:25.689]  This didn't happen.
[01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:26.409]  Give it back to him.
[01:25:27.949 --> 01:25:28.989]  That was the hearing.
[01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:30.670]  The day after.
[01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:31.789]  The fake auction.
[01:25:32.729 --> 01:25:39.350]  The day they called the internet service providers, the U.S. trustee without authorization, and turned the internet off here so I had to go to the backup studio.
[01:25:41.119 --> 01:25:54.000]  And I keep saying that because I've got this audience of millions and millions right now on Talk Radio and X and Infowars.com, but still, I went to the gym this morning with my oldest daughter, and it was hardly anybody there.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.739]  It was probably 15 people in this huge gym.
[01:25:57.779 --> 01:26:00.359]  Of the 15, I counted them, 10 came over.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:00.859]  We're listeners.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.279]  And one of them was the neuroscientist.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.479]  After I worked out, I had like a 20-minute conversation with him.
[01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:10.970]  And they were all listeners.
[01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:20.510]  But only one of them, a lady, was actually listening the last few weeks and was like, oh, it's crazy how they ran that scam.
[01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:21.710]  What's going to really happen now?
[01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:22.609]  And I'm like, well, I'm not sure.
[01:26:23.369 --> 01:26:26.869]  But the other nine people I talked to, like, well, are you still doing your show?
[01:26:28.909 --> 01:26:32.449]  So that's a hoax, people.
[01:26:32.989 --> 01:26:34.489]  But that's the power of it.
[01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.909]  Like Trump.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.579]  Saying the KKK are very fine people.
[01:26:41.319 --> 01:26:44.180]  He said, no, the KKK are terrible and the anti was terrible.
[01:26:44.439 --> 01:26:51.319]  But there were a lot of very fine people that just came out to see the event and see the protest who didn't deserve to be attacked by the police.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.699]  There were a lot of journalists and people there.
[01:26:57.159 --> 01:26:59.140]  Like one of our own reporters got beat up, Millie Weaver.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.000]  That was what he said.
[01:27:01.239 --> 01:27:03.220]  They just said, oh, he said very fine people.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.619]  And technically he did.
[01:27:07.029 --> 01:27:11.390]  I could say, yeah, this morning I got up and took my dog for the walk.
[01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:13.729]  I took Spot for a walk down the street.
[01:27:13.949 --> 01:27:14.770]  And then you just stop there.
[01:27:14.909 --> 01:27:16.069]  Jones took Spot for a walk.
[01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:19.590]  And then he took Spot and threw Spot out into traffic.
[01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.750]  No, I didn't say I threw Spot out into traffic.
[01:27:21.909 --> 01:27:23.069]  But you just take the statement.
[01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:27.909]  Jones says he took Spot for a walk and then threw the dog into traffic.
[01:27:28.090 --> 01:27:29.310]  And I didn't say the traffic part.
[01:27:32.529 --> 01:27:32.930]  See?
[01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:35.630]  So you gotta be really careful.
[01:27:36.609 --> 01:27:37.289]  With these people.
[01:27:37.649 --> 01:27:40.090]  And I know the people tuned in now get that.
[01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:41.090]  You're the hardcore people.
[01:27:41.449 --> 01:27:42.170]  I love you.
[01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:50.470]  But I can't believe their hoax blew up in their face so spectacular.
[01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:51.310]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[01:27:51.489 --> 01:27:51.869]  Just wait.
[01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:56.949]  And then we're still dealing with the fallout.
[01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:58.909]  So please support us at TheOccionStore.com right now.
[01:27:59.010 --> 01:27:59.310]  Thank you.
[01:27:59.869 --> 01:28:00.750]  Plus, they're great products.
[01:28:01.689 --> 01:28:02.529]  So I mentioned this.
[01:28:02.609 --> 01:28:03.210]  I've got to get to it.
[01:28:03.289 --> 01:28:05.229]  Gosh, I was ready to do a five-hour show here.
[01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:08.229]  And I've covered the military news so much.
[01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:11.029]  I already told you France would start bombing next, and now they've announced it.
[01:28:11.409 --> 01:28:14.510]  And they're just totally desperate to ruin any peace deals and do all this.
[01:28:14.609 --> 01:28:15.810]  It's just absolutely horrible.
[01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:17.210]  And I'm going to hit this in a moment.
[01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:18.649]  But since I mentioned it, let's go ahead and go to this.
[01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:25.890]  Here's the head of NPR. Truth is a distraction, Catherine Mayer says.
[01:28:26.029 --> 01:28:27.729]  So they don't even hide this now.
[01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:29.369]  Here it is.
[01:28:30.319 --> 01:28:40.560]  One of the most significant differences, critical for moving from polarization to productivity, is that the Wikipedians who write these articles aren't actually focused on finding the truth.
[01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:47.359]  They're working for something that's a little bit more attainable, which is the best of what we can know right now.
[01:28:48.789 --> 01:28:51.770]  And after seven years there, I actually believe that they're onto something.
[01:28:52.449 --> 01:29:00.810]  That for our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth isn't necessarily the best place to start.
[01:29:01.529 --> 01:29:13.510]  In fact, I think our reverence for the truth might have become a bit of a distraction that is preventing us from finding consensus and getting important things done.
[01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:17.750]  These people are so self-important.
[01:29:19.090 --> 01:29:28.350]  Now what she's really saying is, we need to stop trying to convince people we're telling the truth, and that we are the only authentic thing.
[01:29:29.649 --> 01:29:31.350]  Okay, everybody already knows that.
[01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:32.770]  They already know you're the liar.
[01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:41.510]  But they're obsessed with Wikipedia because it's used to program the AI with all their cobbled together, twisted distortions.
[01:29:43.279 --> 01:29:46.880]  Or they take corporate media and then tell you that's the truth.
[01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:48.079]  Like two men can have a baby.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:51.020]  Or you take this shot, you can't get COVID, you can't share it.
[01:29:51.239 --> 01:29:51.920]  You can't spread it.
[01:29:52.119 --> 01:29:52.840]  It's all lies.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.199]  They're discredited scum.
[01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:57.180]  Now here's a microcosm.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:09.079]  They're coming out and calling a current colonel in the army and a patriot, Tulsi Gabbard, a Russian agent with no evidence.
[01:30:12.279 --> 01:30:15.439]  Well, you don't even need to champion her and say she's not a Russian agent.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.399]  That's the bare minimum.
[01:30:19.159 --> 01:30:39.050]  You say these are desperate lies that have all been debunked, and the people doing it are the globalist The big corporations that have conquered this country and that are anti-American that dissolved our borders and that are censoring us and that are at war with the American people and are demoralizing the American people that are trying to take down monuments of our founding fathers.
[01:30:39.329 --> 01:30:44.710]  And so because they're the outside enemy, they are trying to convince you that loyal Americans are the enemy.
[01:30:44.869 --> 01:30:59.770]  So when you hear Russiagate and you hear somebody's a Russian agent, that means the globalist foreign agents are Are trying to cover up the fact that they're the outside evil force by claiming that our loyal patriots are the outside force.
[01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:01.810]  And it's a fraud.
[01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:18.250]  But at the same time, you mainly just have people call and visit peacefully the senators and put massive pressure on them and have Trump say, I'm going to run people against you Republican senators if you don't confirm every damn one of my...
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.140]  And we're going to destroy you politically if you don't do it.
[01:31:23.319 --> 01:31:26.460]  We're not going to sit here and go, it's like, did you rape your wife today?
[01:31:26.659 --> 01:31:27.359]  No, I didn't.
[01:31:27.479 --> 01:31:29.539]  How dare you say that I raped my wife today?
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:38.500]  How dare you turn that around on me and act like I've got to deny a negative, deny something I can't prove because I've not even been accused of it.
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.779]  Stop letting them set the agenda.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.899]  Point out they're trying to set the agenda.
[01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:47.600]  Point out the whole scam.
[01:31:47.939 --> 01:31:49.560]  Instead of saying, I'm not a Russian agent.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.479]  I'm not a Russian agent.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.659]  I'm actually a good person.
[01:31:52.819 --> 01:31:53.560]  I'm a veteran.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.500]  I'm in the military.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.100]  How dare you?
[01:31:55.159 --> 01:31:55.899]  I'm a good person.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:56.659]  No, no.
[01:31:56.779 --> 01:31:57.539]  You're the globalist.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.239]  You're the scum.
[01:31:58.399 --> 01:32:04.920]  You work for the same Democrats that human trafficked and disappeared 325,000 little kids, many of them in sex slavery.
[01:32:09.699 --> 01:32:12.460]  You're the ones that sent $200-plus billion of our money to Ukraine.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.579]  You're the problem.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:23.300]  Senator Mark Wayne Mullen dismantles Tulsi Russian asset lie.
[01:32:23.699 --> 01:32:25.239]  Okay, great, he dismantled it.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.100]  Why do you even need to dismantle it?
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.939]  And I'm not saying don't dismantle it.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:31.880]  But I'm saying there's got to be another way to go at this.
[01:32:33.409 --> 01:32:38.810]  Instead of, oh, she's so good, she's an American, she's a veteran, she's a current colonel in the military, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:42.310]  You go, Tim Walz is an admitted communist Chinese agent.
[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:46.050]  Half the Democrats in Congress have been caught working for the communist Chinese.
[01:32:46.069 --> 01:32:47.630]  You're the people that hate America.
[01:32:47.909 --> 01:32:50.470]  You want us to believe that red-blooded people are the enemy?
[01:32:51.729 --> 01:32:52.430]  Here it is.
[01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:57.689]  Keep in mind, Tulsi Gabbard is still lieutenant colonel in the United States Army.
[01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.909]  She commands the reserve unit here in Oklahoma and Missouri.
[01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:07.970]  If she was compromised, if she wasn't able to pass a background check, if she wasn't able to do her job, she still wouldn't be in the Army.
[01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:12.729]  Absolutely dead wrong on this, and she should retract those words.
[01:33:12.909 --> 01:33:23.590]  That's the most dangerous thing she could say, is that a United States Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia.
[01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:26.350]  It's actually sad to hear her say that.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:35.460]  When I heard her say that, I thought, I wonder if this is political, because she's upset that Tulsi Gabbard left the Democrat Party because they went woke.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.079]  Because I know they actually got along when they were in the House, and she knows Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.180]  She knows her heart.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.319]  She has a heart to serve.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:47.260]  And so I think that's probably more politically motivated than it actually has any truth to it at all.
[01:33:47.819 --> 01:33:50.060]  All right, that's a good response.
[01:33:50.279 --> 01:33:54.039]  An A-plus within the paradigm of fighting them on their ground.
[01:33:54.899 --> 01:33:56.100]  You say, that's ridiculous.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:59.600]  She commands troops, an incredible lady.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.560]  You're the globalist.
[01:34:01.699 --> 01:34:02.800]  You're the people getting rid of our borders.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.899]  You're the people taking down the Founding Father statues.
[01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:06.439]  You're the people that hate America.
[01:34:06.439 --> 01:34:11.359]  You're the people that take the knee during the National Anthem.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.399]  You're the people that have been totally discredited.
[01:34:16.319 --> 01:34:20.380]  Joe Biden's the one getting $3 million from the mayor of Moscow.
[01:34:22.079 --> 01:34:24.119]  You're the ones that sold us out to Communist China.
[01:34:24.119 --> 01:34:25.819]  You're the ones that got Tampon Tim.
[01:34:26.079 --> 01:34:28.239]  That's why you accuse us of what you are.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.180]  You're the globalists.
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:30.380]  You're the Chi-Com agents.
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:39.060]  And they'll shut up real quick because we need to get on the offense about how globalists are the foreign power and the Communist Chinese are the foreign power.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.039]  You see, they're scared of that.
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.119]  They're scared of talking about Fin Fang and all the rest of it.
[01:34:48.699 --> 01:34:50.279]  So, there you are.
[01:34:51.529 --> 01:34:53.170]  Alright, let's go into these headlines here.
[01:34:54.510 --> 01:34:55.029]  Headline.
[01:34:55.909 --> 01:34:59.609]  France greenlights Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia with their cruise missiles.
[01:34:59.789 --> 01:35:03.529]  So, I said last week, after the Brits bombed, I said next will be the French.
[01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:07.369]  So, how will the Russians respond to that?
[01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:16.430]  Putin announces mass production of the new Ariashnik missiles.
[01:35:17.909 --> 01:35:20.989]  Trump's National Security Advisor pick reveals Ukraine peace vision.
[01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:22.329]  That's positive.
[01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:25.609]  Ukraine military plans for 2025 derailed.
[01:35:26.949 --> 01:35:29.569]  Biden is trying to throw Trump under the Ukrainian bus.
[01:35:29.729 --> 01:35:30.130]  Absolutely.
[01:35:31.409 --> 01:35:34.529]  Merkel admits she didn't believe in Kiev's military ambitions.
[01:35:36.029 --> 01:35:39.390]  Ukrainians have stolen up to half the U.S. aid, ex-Polish deputy minister.
[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:43.149]  U.S. suffered worst telecom hack in history.
[01:35:46.979 --> 01:35:50.100]  Trump eyes ex-intelligence chief as special envoy for Ukraine.
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:51.800]  Yeah, Trump's getting it all set up right now.
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.079]  Richard Grinnell.
[01:35:55.779 --> 01:35:57.140]  So a lot happening there.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.180]  Listen to this.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.079]  Ukraine can make America rich.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.859]  You mean we give them hundreds of billions and you get part of the laundered money, Lindsey Graham?
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:12.180]  U.S. suggesting nuclear deterrent strategy to a first-strike policy.
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.060]  Well, that's already there.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.579]  Force military conscription, fueling, heating crisis in Zelensky's hometown.
[01:36:19.739 --> 01:36:23.380]  And yet you have warned Europeans to stop supporting the war for this nuclear war.
[01:36:24.319 --> 01:36:25.739]  Russia and China drawing closer.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.560]  How does that impact India?
[01:36:30.199 --> 01:36:31.539]  And it goes on from there.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.199]  Now...
[01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:39.289]  Let's continue.
[01:36:39.949 --> 01:36:45.250]  There is a new European alliance announced Saturday.
[01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:57.750]  Even if NATO says they don't want the war, they've created this new, quote, northern group that England heads up, the UK of course, that says the war will continue on.
[01:36:58.329 --> 01:37:01.289]  France greenlights Ukrainian missile strikes deep within Russia.
[01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:04.569]  NATO Secretary General visits Mar-a-Lago.
[01:37:04.829 --> 01:37:05.409]  I broke that.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.819]  Navy says Indo-Pacific commander warns Ukraine aid is draining U.S. missile stocks.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:13.779]  Yep, making a sweep.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.979]  New military alliance formed to block President Trump's plan for peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.
[01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:29.640]  It's called the Northern Group Ukraine Alliance.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:40.350]  Made up of the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, as well as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom.
[01:37:43.789 --> 01:37:45.369]  Here's the declaration from Sweden.
[01:37:46.789 --> 01:38:00.789]  Declaration from the defense ministers of Northern Group, saying the war will continue even if Trump gets a peace deal with NATO. And the big news is, Trump has been in shadow diplomacy for weeks.
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:03.289]  It's come out that he and Musk have been talking to Zelensky and others.
[01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:16.029]  Xi's come out with red lines now for the first time against the U.S. Putin successfully tested a nuclear delivery system with the new missile.
[01:38:19.789 --> 01:38:21.770]  Extremely dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:22.409 --> 01:38:24.989]  And they're continuing to escalate.
[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:35.130]  Who knows what Russia's going to do when France starts raining their cruise missiles down on Russia proper.
[01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:40.670]  And Biden got asked, what's going to happen when these missiles drop?
[01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:44.369]  Couldn't this cause World War III? And he said, shut up.
[01:38:44.489 --> 01:38:46.770]  I say you be quiet until I speak, okay?
[01:38:53.810 --> 01:39:05.470]  So, the policymakers at the State Department and the CIA that are doing all this think they can hide behind Biden, but they're all going to be held accountable, especially if bigger war breaks out.
[01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:07.810]  These are serious war crimes.
[01:39:08.989 --> 01:39:17.329]  And we've heard the talk of impeachment or 25th Amendment of Biden for violating the War Powers Act and attacking a sovereign country without congressional approval.
[01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:20.050]  We need that action.
[01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:25.229]  We need that action now because Germany has said they're not going to fire the missiles.
[01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.909]  And they're ready for World War III though and have 800,000 troops ready.
[01:39:31.869 --> 01:39:33.270]  Austria is not going to fire the missiles.
[01:39:33.529 --> 01:39:34.850]  Italy is not going to fire the missiles.
[01:39:35.029 --> 01:39:36.609]  But France is going to start.
[01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:39.109]  Then I would expect the Netherlands will start after that.
[01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:42.750]  And then they put in that globalist in Poland.
[01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:51.989]  So I would imagine Poland, the current rate, France will start bombing them within 48 hours.
[01:39:52.810 --> 01:39:56.090]  Then the Netherlands in like four days.
[01:39:57.010 --> 01:39:59.909]  Then I would expect Poland will start bombing Russia.
[01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:06.510]  And to get the coalition in first, and they know that Russia has said Poland's the main staging ground.
[01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:12.930]  If Poland fires any missiles, the Russians have said there's a good chance they're going to go ahead and hit them as the first NATO country.
[01:40:14.539 --> 01:40:18.380]  And so Poland is about to be the detonator for World War III expanding.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.779]  It's already in the first stages.
[01:40:20.319 --> 01:40:28.720]  Just like they were the detonator for World War II in 1940. So history repeats, and it rhymes.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.840]  And the globalists know there's a global awakening, know there's a global renaissance.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.920]  They know we're 56 days from Trump getting in.
[01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:40.310]  And so Congress has already done all this funding that's already there.
[01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:43.050]  Even if Trump gets in, Ukraine will fight on with another year of funding.
[01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:49.250]  They got this new northern group headed up by the UK. And Poland that says they're going to keep going.
[01:40:51.649 --> 01:40:55.069]  And there it is, U.S. military base in Poland as priority target, Russia warns.
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:57.550]  Yeah, I mean, Russia's been very, very clear about this.
[01:40:57.630 --> 01:40:58.569]  And Putin said last week...
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.680]  So we've tested an ICBM nuke delivery system.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.279]  It got past your missile defense systems.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.920]  And I just want to say this is not the last thing we're going to do for the last attack.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.020]  And if things continue, there's going to be bigger attacks.
[01:41:11.039 --> 01:41:16.300]  And we'll tell civilian areas, need to clear out if we're about to hit them.
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.859]  That would only be a nuclear weapon.
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:25.020]  And they've talked about demonstrating a nuclear weapon, getting on the phone, even though the White House hasn't talked to them for years.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.079]  That's admitted AP Reuters.
[01:41:26.319 --> 01:41:27.239]  How insane is that?
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.579]  So they just make a public announcement.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:43.899]  Okay, tomorrow at noon, we're going to drop a 10 kiloton smaller nuclear weapon on this military district that's on the outskirts of X. I don't mean X, X Elon Musk, X city.
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:51.340]  They've already designated a couple Polish military zones that are right by medium-sized towns.
[01:41:53.779 --> 01:41:55.260]  Towns of 50,000, 100,000.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:01.380]  And they're going to send the message, you know, okay, we're going to vaporize this and show the panic and show the...
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:04.020]  And go, okay, what are you going to do, NATO? Because we're about to nuke you.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.579]  You make the first move.
[01:42:06.779 --> 01:42:08.920]  And that is taking us into check.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.699]  And then mutually assured destruction is checkmate.
[01:42:12.859 --> 01:42:13.359]  Nobody wins.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:13.880]  We all die.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.199]  So they've tested the ICBM. They've shown it can get past the systems.
[01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:24.489]  They got a whole bunch of different types of missiles that'll do this.
[01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:31.449]  And I'm very optimistic that we can just get Trump in and stop this.
[01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:34.210]  But the New Old Order's got other plans with 56 days.
[01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:36.170]  So that's a big deal.
[01:42:36.869 --> 01:42:38.529]  All right, I am loaded for bear.
[01:42:38.890 --> 01:42:41.630]  I only covered three of my stats today.
[01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:43.670]  All these, this is not props.
[01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:45.109]  All this is stuff I got ready to cover.
[01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:46.590]  But that's okay.
[01:42:49.699 --> 01:42:53.520]  Chase Geiser comes in Sunday Night Live two hours after me and he moves quick through clips and news.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.539]  I'm sure he'll be covering a lot of similar things I'm covering.
[01:42:57.739 --> 01:43:01.699]  And I'm going to come in tomorrow with all the latest news and hit all the rest of it.
[01:43:01.779 --> 01:43:02.439]  I didn't get into.
[01:43:03.539 --> 01:43:08.100]  Six states in the U.S. under Agenda 2030 are banning RVs.
[01:43:09.779 --> 01:43:12.539]  California's already banned new lawnmowers and gas cars.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.359]  It's total control.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.640]  And if you think they're just going to ban the sale of RVs, they're going to ban RVs, period.
[01:43:19.279 --> 01:43:20.899]  Because they don't want you mobile.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:21.800]  They don't want you free.
[01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:26.880]  And they want, with the housing prices exploding, to not have people go mobile.
[01:43:27.079 --> 01:43:29.420]  They want to pin you down and control you.
[01:43:29.539 --> 01:43:30.399]  And that's all.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.760]  You'll owe nothing and be happy.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.659]  No, we're not going to be happy.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.060]  So we're fighting for your future.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.079]  We're fighting for freedom.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.340]  We're fighting for prosperity.
[01:43:38.619 --> 01:43:39.020]  Amen.
[01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:44.770]  It takes word of mouth, it takes action, it takes prayer, and it takes supporting those that fight for freedom.
[01:43:44.909 --> 01:43:46.970]  So please, take action now.
[01:43:47.069 --> 01:44:00.149]  Get great products, incredible supplements like Ultimate CMOS, the Superfood, Incredible Patriot Year, and more at the AlexJonesStore.com and our other great sponsor for great supplements, drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com.

[01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:13.609]  He's only president-elect right now.
[01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:15.510]  We are exposing the globalists.

[01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:22.789]  The purchase was fraudulent.

[01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:31.130]  But regardless, I'm gonna stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:36.590]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:45.270]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:48.649]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.

[01:45:12.729 --> 01:45:13.430]  It's insane.
[01:45:13.569 --> 01:45:15.149]  Get that and other supplements and then...
[01:45:15.569 --> 01:45:19.229]  There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[01:45:19.409 --> 01:45:25.750]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:26.710]  They have the best designs.
[01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:28.829]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[01:45:28.949 --> 01:45:31.310]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:32.970]  These designs are incredible.
[01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:39.369]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[01:45:39.609 --> 01:45:40.130]  Here they are.
[01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:41.069]  Look at this one.
[01:45:41.250 --> 01:45:45.149]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:47.170]  We are all Alex Jones.
[01:45:47.329 --> 01:45:48.350]  You've got to get that.
[01:45:48.949 --> 01:45:50.670]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:51.609]  Oh my goodness.
[01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:54.109]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water.
[01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:55.229]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:58.609]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[01:45:59.069 --> 01:46:00.229]  Team Humanity.
[01:46:00.449 --> 01:46:01.909]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[01:46:02.050 --> 01:46:04.250]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[01:46:04.449 --> 01:46:06.189]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:11.800]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:13.140]  Darkest Hour.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.619]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.739]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.880]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[01:46:22.439 --> 01:46:27.239]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[01:46:27.399 --> 01:46:39.859]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[01:46:39.939 --> 01:46:43.680]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:47.340]  And so an extra, extra, extra large is like $16, $17.
[01:46:47.659 --> 01:46:48.659]  A small is like $15.
[01:46:48.899 --> 01:46:50.000]  The printing costs money.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.439]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[01:46:51.539 --> 01:46:52.760]  We get part of it to operate.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:55.960]  We're making like $6, $7 on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:56.960]  And they spread the word.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:57.699]  You meet like-minded people.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:04.100]  But when you get the marked-up shirts, only two of them are marked up to $50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:07.340]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[01:47:07.699 --> 01:47:18.359]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.960]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:31.260]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[01:47:31.399 --> 01:47:33.239]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.680]  You're going to want to order again.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.140]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[01:47:37.539 --> 01:47:38.539]  I'm suing the deep state.
[01:47:38.699 --> 01:47:39.520]  We're going after them.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:45.640]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.100]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.859]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:48:00.460]  So go down to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
